        <h1>Chapter 369</h1>
        <div class="content">
            <p>Here is the full English translation of the Chinese excerpt:</p><p></p><p>Outside the Seven-Colored Crystal Pagoda, üç≠üíò‚ùªÔºô—ï–Ω‚ìä·ô≠.ùêú·µí–ºüêíüç©</p><p></p><p>The leaders of the various tribes were either standing or sitting cross-legged.</p><p></p><p>Inside the Seven-Colored Crystal Pagoda, a commotion had already broken out, but they were completely unaware of it.</p><p></p><p>It couldn't be helped, as the Seven-Colored Crystal Pagoda had isolated all perception.</p><p></p><p>Han Jinlong and Jiang Wuxin were sitting cross-legged there, with Zhao Di respectfully standing behind them, his gaze occasionally glancing towards the Seven-Colored Crystal Pagoda.</p><p></p><p>The corner of Han Jinlong and Jiang Wuxin's eyes would occasionally look towards the Celestial Tribe's Shengluo...</p><p></p><p>Their eyes were filled with worry.</p><p></p><p>This time, they had offended the Celestial Tribe...</p><p></p><p>They recalled that after the Seven-Colored Crystal Pagoda, the Celestial Tribe's prince would come looking for Lu Changsheng, and they felt their scalps tingle.</p><p></p><p>Shengluo coming to find their Dao companion Changsheng was definitely not a good thing.</p><p></p><p>"Wind Xing Venerable, what are we to do...?" Han Jinlong transmitted anxiously.</p><p></p><p>Jiang Wuxin knew what Han Jinlong was referring to, and after a moment of contemplation, he transmitted in a solemn voice: "Golden Wheel King, since Shengluo wants to find Dao companion Changsheng, then let him do so. It may not necessarily lead to any trouble..."</p><p></p><p>Han Jinlong wryly smiled: "How could there be no trouble? You saw Dao companion Changsheng's attitude and tone before he entered the Seven-Colored Crystal Pagoda."</p><p></p><p>"As the Celestial Tribe's prince, how could he let this humiliation in front of all the tribes go?"</p><p></p><p>Jiang Wuxin paused, then said in a deep voice: "No matter what, if Shengluo harbors the intention to harm Dao companion Changsheng, we cannot stand idly by."</p><p></p><p>Han Jinlong pursed his lips and said, "Yes, the appearance of the Eternal Immortal Body in our Human Tribe is a great blessing, and we cannot allow it to be lost."</p><p></p><p>Jiang Wuxin forced a smile and transmitted while stroking his beard: "The Eternal Immortal Body is secondary. More importantly, Dao companion Changsheng is of our same tribe. If we were to hand him over, it would be a devastating blow to our Human Tribe."</p><p></p><p>"Our Human Tribe could never commit the act of handing over one of our own!"</p><p></p><p>Han Jinlong nodded, sighing gravely: "By offending the Celestial Tribe, our Human Tribe this time, I'm afraid, will suffer greatly."</p><p></p><p>Jiang Wuxin contemplated and said, "I hope Dao companion Changsheng can lead Fang Xing and the others to obtain a few more Crystal Hearts. Then we can use the Crystal Hearts as bargaining chips to send to the Dragon Tribe, and I believe the Dragon Tribe will be willing to speak a few good words for us to the Celestial Tribe."</p><p></p><p>As he said this, Jiang Wuxin glanced at Ao Xing in the distance.</p><p></p><p>Han Jinlong frowned and said, "If we use the Crystal Hearts to appease the Celestial Tribe, then for the subsequent attacks by the Viper Tribe and other tribes on our Human Tribe, will we have to rely on ourselves?"</p><p></p><p>Jiang Wuxin bitterly smiled, "There's no help for it. Compared to that, the priority is to first protect Dao companion Changsheng."</p><p></p><p>Han Jinlong: "Mm."</p><p></p><p>.........</p><p></p><p>Shengluo's gaze would occasionally look towards Han Jinlong and Jiang Wuxin, his eyes carrying a cold aura.</p><p></p><p>The Human Tribe...</p><p></p><p>He recalled the tone of that blue-robed Human Tribe member earlier, and his murderous intent grew even stronger.</p><p></p><p>What a huge audacity...</p><p></p><p>Unfortunately, during the time in the Seven-Colored Crystal Pagoda, he could not make a move.</p><p></p><p>Many rules were determined by the Heavenly Dao of the Divine-Demon Battlefield, in order to maintain a certain balance.</p><p></p><p>Otherwise, the top ten tribes would be an unforgiving blow to all the tribes.</p><p></p><p>At the same time,</p><p></p><p>Ao Xing and Bi Qiong were chatting together, both in good spirits.</p><p></p><p>"Ao Xing, look at Shengluo's expression, it seems he's truly angered," Bi Qiong said jokingly, his mood quite good.</p><p></p><p>His mood depended on how Shengluo's mood was.</p><p></p><p>Ao Xing shook his head with a smile, not making any comments.</p><p></p><p>Bi Qiong suddenly said meaningfully, "Ao Xing, why did you speak up for the Human Tribe earlier?"</p><p></p><p>Ao Xing's eyes flashed lightly as he said, "There's no helping or not helping. You feel that this Saint Child didn't have any intention to..."</p><p></p><p>Here is the full English translation of the Chinese excerpt:</p><p></p><p>"Was there anything wrong with what I said?" </p><p></p><p>Bi Qiong shook his head, "No, what you said was very good. There are not many such conscientious clan saints like you anymore."</p><p></p><p>Ao Xing's face darkened.</p><p></p><p>...</p><p></p><p>Five days later, half the time limit had already passed.</p><p></p><p>On the first floor of the Seven-Colored Glazed Pagoda, the members of the Myriad Tribes still stood there, motionless.</p><p></p><p>But their expressions were becoming increasingly grim.</p><p></p><p>At this rate, the Glazed Heart would truly be taken away by the human race... Damn it!</p><p></p><p>As for the tribes at the end of the Myriad Tribes, such as the Fly Tribe Chief, their expressions were calm and indifferent, not caring much.</p><p></p><p>After all, even if they were allowed to snatch it, they could hardly get it. They felt quite comfortable seeing the leading Myriad Tribes being humiliated.</p><p></p><p>"Ah, I can't stand it anymore! The human race is not here, I refuse to believe we still can't make a move!"</p><p></p><p>Suddenly, one of the foreign tribes could no longer hold back and strode forward abruptly.</p><p></p><p>"Bang!"</p><p></p><p>Then he exploded.</p><p></p><p>Immediately, the Myriad Tribes members were frightened and their hopes were dashed.</p><p></p><p>The members of the Celestial Tribe, Devouring Ancestor, and Dragon Tribe remained silent.</p><p></p><p>They believed that since the human race had acted so recklessly, they would pay a heavy price after leaving, and the Glazed Heart would be spat out again.</p><p></p><p>...</p><p></p><p>On the seventh floor of the Seven-Colored Glazed Pagoda, Lu Changsheng appeared.</p><p></p><p>The Glazed Heart was a product of the first floor, and the second to sixth floors also had different characteristics, and except for the first floor, each subsequent floor was vast, like a world of its own.</p><p></p><p>All in all, this Seven-Colored Glazed Pagoda was not bad, it was a precious treasure.</p><p></p><p>It could be said to be the best treasure he had seen so far on his journey.</p><p></p><p>He was a bit curious about how this Seven-Colored Glazed Pagoda appeared on this divine-demonic battlefield.</p><p></p><p>"Senior... Can you come over here for a moment?"</p><p></p><p>Suddenly, the voice of the Pagoda Spirit rang in Lu Changsheng's ears.</p><p></p><p>Lu Changsheng's eyes flickered, and he looked towards the dark front, then unhesitatingly walked towards the direction of the voice.</p><p></p><p>Lu Changsheng strolled in the profound darkness, his expression unchanged.</p><p></p><p>The environment of this seventh floor was vastly different from the previous six floors.</p><p></p><p>The first six floors were all bright and dazzling, living up to the name of the Seven-Colored Glazed Pagoda.</p><p></p><p>But this seventh floor was somewhat gloomy.</p><p></p><p>He didn't know how long he had walked, but the surroundings were still shrouded in darkness.</p><p></p><p>Beneath his feet, there was no ground, giving Lu Changsheng a feeling of walking in endless void, desolate and boundless.</p><p></p><p>The difference was that there were no stars, only endless darkness and oppression.</p><p></p><p>"Senior, have you arrived yet?"</p><p></p><p>At this time, the Pagoda Spirit's voice, like that of a child, rang in Lu Changsheng's ears again.</p><p></p><p>Lu Changsheng looked towards a dark direction and took a step forward!</p><p></p><p>This step seemed to cross countless miles!</p><p></p><p>But the surroundings were still a vast darkness, with nothing in sight.</p><p></p><p>"Senior, where are you?"</p><p></p><p>The Pagoda Spirit's voice sounded again.</p><p></p><p>Lu Changsheng sighed and slowly closed his eyes, then gradually opened them, and a blue light flashed in his eyes.</p><p></p><p>Looking ahead with the Eye of the Great Dao, all the darkness seemed to be dispersed, and everything in front of him appeared in his vision, with nowhere to hide.</p><p></p><p>"Senior, where are you?"</p><p></p><p>This time, the Pagoda Spirit's voice came from behind Lu Changsheng.</p><p></p><p>Lu Changsheng narrowed his eyes and slowly turned around, and saw ten zhang away, a dense network of chains connected to the darkness from all directions, like a huge spider web.</p><p></p><p>At the center of this chain network, there was a barefoot boy with a face full of blood vessels and a sinister expression, who was confined.</p><p></p><p>At this moment, the boy was silently looking at Lu Changsheng.</p>

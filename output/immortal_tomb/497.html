        <h1>Chapter 497</h1>
        <div class="content">
            <p>Here is the full English translation of the Chinese excerpt:</p><p></p><p>"Master, when shall we go?" the old turtle asked cautiously.</p><p></p><p>The old turtle was a bit afraid that Luchengsheng would disdain him for being weak and not take him along.</p><p></p><p>The old turtle knew that the "worms" on the so-called Creation Pillar must be terrifyingly powerful.</p><p></p><p>Perhaps even the master would be in danger, and as the master's mount, he must accompany him, even if it meant death.</p><p></p><p>Luchengsheng looked at the old turtle for a while and said, "After you have mastered the laws of space, destruction, and yin-yang, we will go. You are still a bit weak now."</p><p></p><p>In fact, Luchengsheng would most likely take the old turtle even without him asking. </p><p></p><p>As an immortal celestial turtle, the old turtle had extraordinary talents. If he could thoroughly comprehend the three supreme laws and evolve into the Dao or even higher, he could be of great help.</p><p></p><p>The Creation Pillar was immensely, overwhelmingly huge! It could support the endless void and nurture countless galaxies, showing just how colossal it was!</p><p></p><p>From the moment Luchengsheng took the old turtle as his mount, it had been predestined.</p><p></p><p>"However, the 'worms' from the endless void outside the Creation Pillar, capable of gnawing at the foundation of the endless void, must be extremely powerful. Are you afraid, old turtle?" Luchengsheng suddenly chuckled lightly.</p><p></p><p>This was the first time Luchengsheng had used the word "extremely" to describe his opponents!</p><p></p><p>Perhaps one or two or three or a few of them would be no problem for Luchengsheng, but the worms on the eight Creation Pillars must be countless!</p><p></p><p>The old turtle swallowed hard, then trembled as he spoke: </p><p></p><p>"Master, the old turtle fears nothing, not even death! If I can be of any help to you, it would be the greatest honor of my life."</p><p></p><p>What the old turtle really wanted to say was that the endless void belonged to all, and if anything happened to it, the countless beings within would all perish! </p><p></p><p>Why must the master go alone to face this? Why not gather the top experts of the endless void to confront it together?</p><p></p><p>Luchengsheng seemed to understand what the old turtle was thinking, and said, "It's too far. The Creation Pillar is at the end of the endless void, a place no one can ever reach."</p><p></p><p>The old turtle understood and fell silent. If the master said it was far, then it must be truly, extremely far.</p><p></p><p>After all, in the old turtle's understanding, the endless void was boundless. </p><p></p><p>Except for the master, who else could know the endless void had an end?</p><p></p><p>"Old turtle, I shall tell you that any being who dies within the order and causality of the endless void, I have the supreme means to revive them! </p><p></p><p>But at the Creation Pillar, if they die by the hands of those 'worms', that would be true death, and even I would be powerless to save them," Luchengsheng said softly.</p><p></p><p>The old turtle unhesitatingly replied, "Master, rest assured. If it comes to that, the old turtle has lived enough."</p><p></p><p>Luchengsheng looked deeply at the old turtle. "Let's go."</p><p></p><p>"Yes." </p><p></p><p>The old turtle quickly flew forward.</p><p></p><p>Luchengsheng's gaze became hazy as he looked at the sea of laws.</p><p></p><p>No wonder he had knocked the old turtle unconscious and placed him in the Demon-Subduing Tower, no wonder he had left the Xiaoyao Sect disciples to roam in the Qiankun Heaven.</p><p></p><p>His words about the Xiaoyao Sect being a burden were just a subconscious protection.</p><p></p><p>If the Xiaoyao Sect disciples went to the Creation Pillar, with their strength, they would most likely all perish.</p><p></p><p>Whether it was Tongxin, Lin Dong, Guhelin, Chen Dadao, or the elder executives like Peng Fang, they would most likely all die.</p><p></p><p>...</p><p></p><p>In the Soul Realm, at the bottom of the Reincarnation Lake.</p><p></p><p>"Hehe haha haha~" </p><p></p><p>The Reincarnation Demon Child looked up at the lake surface sealed by abstruse spiritual energy and let out a cold laugh.</p><p></p><p>"My lord, we will meet soon. Please wait for me..."</p><p></p><p>Saying that, the Reincarnation Demon Child closed his eyes and sank into the icy lake water, drifting with the waves.</p><p></p><p>At the same time, in the Soul...</p><p></p><p>Here is the full English translation of the Chinese excerpt:</p><p></p><p>In the depths of the realm, a dark and gloomy palace.</p><p></p><p>Hunhui rubbed his right eye and complained:</p><p></p><p>"Damn, why has my right eye been twitching lately?"</p><p></p><p>"No, I have to find out the reason!"</p><p></p><p>Hunhui suddenly stood up, widening his eyes, and the strange patterns in his ox-like pupils began to flicker!</p><p></p><p>In front of Hunhui, layers of mist appeared, the mist frantically dispersing, but the scene behind it refused to reveal itself!</p><p></p><p>Hunhui gritted his teeth and increased his effort: "Show yourself to me!!!"</p><p></p><p>Sizzling sounds!</p><p></p><p>The mist rolled and became even more violent, gradually being blown open at one corner, revealing a blue lamp.</p><p></p><p>The next moment, the blue lamp was shrouded by the mist again!</p><p></p><p>And Hunhui also abruptly took a step back, his eyes extremely sore!</p><p></p><p>"There must be something about to happen, what is that blue lamp, why does it seem familiar......"</p><p></p><p>Hunhui rubbed his eyes and frowned, muttering.</p><p></p><p>After a moment, Hunhui shouted:</p><p></p><p>"Summon the four great spirit generals, Chimei, Wangliang, to come see me!"</p><p></p><p>.........</p><p></p><p>In the sky above the Sea of Laws.</p><p></p><p>Lu Changsheng suddenly raised his eyebrows, and after a moment of finger-counting, a cold smile appeared on the corner of his mouth.</p><p></p><p>The old turtle, who had been earnestly advancing and deep in thought, suddenly shivered.</p><p></p><p>"Master, what has happened?"</p><p></p><p>"That reincarnation devil child is quite interesting, he actually has the intention to break through the seal." Lu Changsheng smiled.</p><p></p><p>Now that he had awakened his memories, his mind was only focused on the Creation Pillar, and he really didn't want to bother with such small matters.</p><p></p><p>Ah, the reincarnation devil child?</p><p></p><p>"Master, shall we go to the Soul Realm?"</p><p></p><p>The old turtle quickly asked.</p><p></p><p>"Go, I happen to have something to do in the Soul Realm, but there's no hurry, let's attend the Elf Clan's grand ceremony first. In the Qiankun Heavens, that Chu You has a strong killing intent towards me, so I naturally can't let him down, I have to give this little ant a good beating."</p><p></p><p>Lu Changsheng smiled gently, as if he and Chu You were bosom friends.</p><p></p><p>The old turtle couldn't help but swallow hard, that Chu You is really something, why did he have to provoke the mightiest one in the Endless Void?</p><p></p><p>After that, Lu Changsheng and the old turtle flew on their way, soon to arrive at the Elf Clan.</p><p></p><p>Along the way, perhaps because Lu Changsheng, the Dao Venerable, was present, all evil forces retreated and dared not approach.</p><p></p><p>.........</p><p></p><p>At the end of the Sea of Laws, there was a vast continent.</p><p></p><p>This was the location of the nine peak forces, the mightiest powers in the world.</p><p></p><p>The Elf Clan has been bustling lately, with red banners hanging everywhere and red carpets laid out.</p><p></p><p>Because in a couple of days, the grand ceremony will begin, and the representatives of the nine peak forces will all be present, the Elf Clan cannot be careless.</p><p></p><p>In fact, this grand ceremony is held by the Elf Clan once every few million years.</p><p></p><p>The core of the ceremony is to divide the Ascension Island, and the various forces can also exchange other matters, which can be considered a conference.</p><p></p><p>At the same time, many forces have already arrived at the ceremony venue, as two days is a short time for them.</p><p></p><p>"The Sect Master of the Demon Subduing Valley and the Junior Sect Master have arrived!"</p><p></p><p>"The Clan Leader of the Li Clan and the First Star Child have arrived!"</p><p></p><p>"......"</p><p></p><p>"The Clan Leader of the Chu Clan and the Third Light Child have arrived!"</p><p></p><p>Just then, with the sound of high-pitched announcements, the nine peak forces actually arrived together!</p><p></p><p>Immediately, the Elf Clan became lively, and all the forces that had arrived earlier stood up to welcome them.</p><p></p><p>At the same time, Lu Changsheng, riding on the old turtle, had just arrived on this continent, right on time.</p><p></p><p>"Master, where is the Elf Clan?"</p><p></p><p>"Over there."</p>

        <h1>Chapter 361</h1>
        <div class="content">
            <p>Here is the full English translation of the Chinese excerpt:</p><p></p><p>Lu Changsheng looked at the indignant Han Jinlong and couldn't help but smile inwardly as he casually asked, "What if all the Jade Hearts in the Seven-Colored Jade Pagoda were taken?"</p><p></p><p>Huh?</p><p></p><p>Han Jinlong and Jiang Wuxin stared at Lu Changsheng, thinking they had misheard.</p><p></p><p>All... all of them taken?</p><p></p><p>"Uh... this, Fellow Daoist Lu, such a situation has never occurred before. Not to mention, all the ones who enter are at the Shen Xuan realm, and the power gap won't be too large, so it's impossible for this to happen," Han Jinlong said gravely.</p><p></p><p>"More importantly, no clan would dare to do this, not even the number one clan on the Myriad Clan Ranking, the Heavenly God Clan, nor the Devouring Beast Clan, Dragon Clan, or Phoenix Clan."</p><p></p><p>"The Jade Hearts are extremely important to any clan. Such an act would only invite the wrath of all the clans! Even the mighty Heavenly God Clan couldn't withstand the fury of the Myriad Clans!"</p><p></p><p>"Even if they could safely retreat back to their clan under the rules of the Divine-Demonic Battlefield, once the time limit is up, the Myriad Clans would surely swarm out!"</p><p></p><p>Han Jinlong spoke with a grave expression.</p><p></p><p>There is a protection time rule for the Seven-Colored Jade Pagoda after obtaining the Jade Hearts.</p><p></p><p>This protection time mechanism is essentially to take care of the clans ranked lower on the Myriad Clan Ranking.</p><p></p><p>If there were no such rule, the weak minority clans who managed to obtain the Jade Hearts would be unable to defend them.</p><p></p><p>They would likely be plundered the moment they left the Seven-Colored Jade Pagoda!</p><p></p><p>A futile effort, like trying to hold water in a bamboo basket.</p><p></p><p>Jiang Wuxin took a slight breath.</p><p></p><p>If Lu Changsheng hadn't brought this up, no one would have even considered this possibility before.</p><p></p><p>To take all the Jade Hearts from the Seven-Colored Jade Pagoda... that would be too outrageous!</p><p></p><p>Lu Changsheng's eyes flickered with a light smile as he said, "I was just curious and asked, nothing more."</p><p></p><p>"Mm." Han Jinlong and Jiang Wuxin nodded, not detecting anything unusual, thinking it was just Lu Changsheng's curiosity.</p><p></p><p>After all, such a thing was like a fantasy.</p><p></p><p>To be honest, if such an unbelievable event were to occur, the entire Divine-Demonic Battlefield might go completely crazy.</p><p></p><p>Jiang Wuxin and Han Jinlong fell silent, while the corners of Lu Changsheng's mouth curled up in a smile.</p><p></p><p>He had thought of something amusing.</p><p></p><p>Coincidentally, he could also see if there were any strong experts in the Myriad Clans worthy of his attention.</p><p></p><p>With that, Lu Changsheng raised his gaze to the Divine Body Ranking and Individual Combat Strength Ranking...</p><p></p><p>If he was going to play, he might as well play big.</p><p></p><p>...</p><p></p><p>Jiang Wuxin and Han Jinlong were still deep in thought, unaware that their plans after the Seven-Colored Jade Pagoda, including slaying Zi Xuanyong and dealing with the invasion of certain minority clans, might all be disrupted or even interrupted by Lu Changsheng!</p><p></p><p>"Fellow Daoist Lu, for our Human Clan's venture into the Seven-Colored Jade Pagoda, we rely on you as the strongest," Jiang Wuxin said solemnly with a cupped fist salute.</p><p></p><p>Han Jinlong also saluted with a cupped fist, knowing that in terms of potential, Lu Changsheng, with his Eternal Immortal Physique, was the number one in the Human Clan, no, the entire Divine-Demonic Battlefield, no, perhaps even the entire Boundless Void.</p><p></p><p>Lu Changsheng waved his hand casually with an unconcerned smile. "It's a small matter, don't worry. Since we're here, I'll try to get as many Jade Hearts as possible for the Human Clan."</p><p></p><p>Hearing this, the two men felt somewhat relieved. With Lu Changsheng here, they should be able to obtain three, four, or even five Jade Hearts.</p><p></p><p>"There's something I'd like to ask you two," Lu Changsheng suddenly said.</p><p></p><p>"Fellow Daoist Lu, please feel free to ask. We are all comrades," Han Jinlong said with a smile, raising his cup.</p><p></p><p>Ever since Sword Sovereign had shown such courtesy to Lu Changsheng, he no longer dared to underestimate him.</p><p></p><p>Here is the full English translation of the Chinese excerpt:</p><p></p><p>Until today, knowing about the Eternal Life Body, Han Jinlong's heart had a subtle sense of respect.</p><p></p><p>Lu Changsheng nodded slightly, and said meaningfully, "Your five masters are much stronger than me, and you also know that I possess the Eternal Life Body. Why don't you just seize my Eternal Life Body?"</p><p></p><p>"For you, suppressing me should be very easy, right?"</p><p></p><p>After saying this, Lu Changsheng quietly looked at the two of them.</p><p></p><p>Han Jinlong and Jiang Wuxin's eyes flickered, and they looked at Lu Changsheng with a complex gaze, then fell silent.</p><p></p><p>"Longevity Daoist friend, I, Han Jinlong, have never been a hypocritical person. I will speak directly, and the following words are from the bottom of my heart! If there are any mistakes, please forgive me."</p><p></p><p>Suddenly, Han Jinlong raised his head and solemnly said to Lu Changsheng.</p><p></p><p>Lu Changsheng nodded slightly, indicating for him to continue.</p><p></p><p>Han Jinlong took a deep breath and said seriously, "To be honest, who doesn't want the Eternal Life Body?"</p><p></p><p>"But the Eternal Life Body appearing in our Human Tribe is not easy, it is a gift from heaven. Who knows what consequences forcibly seizing it will bring? If anything goes wrong, the Human Tribe will suffer a devastating loss, and we will not hesitate to die!"</p><p></p><p>Saying this, Han Jinlong stood up, waved his sleeve, and laughed loudly:</p><p></p><p>"Moreover, Longevity Daoist friend, don't underestimate us. On this Deity-Demon Battlefield, while we may not dare to say we are the best in other aspects, we are definitely the most united race among all the tribes!"</p><p></p><p>"In daily life, there may be some minor conflicts, but when it comes to the interests of the entire tribe, everyone, everything, even life... will prioritize the tribe!"</p><p></p><p>"Well said!" Jiang Wuxin clapped his hands and looked at Lu Changsheng, speaking in a deep voice:</p><p></p><p>"Young friend Lu, you can rest assured, we... will never make you feel cold-hearted."</p><p></p><p>"Among our Human Tribe, whoever dares to have designs on your Eternal Life Body... even if it's the Tyrant King, the Stick Saint, or even Lord Sword Venerable, I will be the first to step forward and stop them!"</p><p></p><p>"But Lord Sword Venerable and the others, they are not that kind of person. Longevity Daoist friend, you can rest assured, they also understand the importance of this matter."</p><p></p><p>Lu Changsheng nodded slightly, and a trace of satisfaction flashed in his eyes. This Han Jinlong and Jiang Wuxin were not hypocritical.</p><p></p><p>Wanting is wanting, without so many twists and turns.</p><p></p><p>These so-called human masters are indeed not bad.</p><p></p><p>If it weren't for these five masters supporting them, the Human Tribe on the Deity-Demon Battlefield might have long since been scattered in the conflicts of the myriad tribes.</p><p></p><p>"Good, I understand." Lu Changsheng cupped his hands and returned the solemn greeting.</p><p></p><p>Regardless of other matters, it was only because these people were worthy.</p><p></p><p>If the performance of these masters was unimpressive, he would simply turn around and leave.</p><p></p><p>He might even slap them away on his way out.</p><p></p><p>Han Jinlong and Jiang Wuxin's faces broke into smiles.</p><p></p><p>They could feel that after this heartfelt conversation, the Longevity Daoist friend had become much closer to them.</p><p></p><p>Indeed, sincerity is the most powerful technique.</p><p></p><p>At this moment, Lu Changsheng's eyes suddenly flashed, and he turned his head to look in a certain direction.</p><p></p><p>Soon, Han Jinlong and Jiang Wuxin also sensed it, and their brows immediately furrowed slightly. A flying vessel was approaching them.</p><p></p><p>Which tribe could it be? </p><p></p><p>Hopefully not an enemy tribe, or else they would have to fight directly.</p><p></p><p>On this Deity-Demon Battlefield, as long as it's one-on-one, except for the top hundred on the Myriad Tribe Ranking, the rest, their Human Tribe has never lost to anyone!</p><p></p><p>"Haha, isn't that Wind Velocity Venerable and Golden Wheel King? It's been a while, you're both well."</p><p></p><p>The next moment, a huge dragon carriage emerged from the void, and on the deck, a young man with horns on his head stood there, smiling.</p><p></p><p>On the Scorching Sun Heavenly Wheel, whether it was Fang Xing, Mo Liang Qiu, or Han Jinlong and Jiang Wuxin, their expressions all changed!</p><p></p><p>The Holy Son of the Dragon Tribe, Ao Xing!</p>

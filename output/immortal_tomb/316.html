        <div class="content">
            <p>Here is the full English translation of the Chinese excerpt:</p><p></p><p>At the edge of the Moon Star Domain. üëπüíóÔºñ‚ûàùìº‚íΩœÖùîÅ.ùìíùì∏‡πìüòù‡µ†</p><p></p><p>A young man in blue robes appeared, followed by a bald man and a woman in a blood-red dress.</p><p></p><p>They were Lu Changsheng, Li Shueyan, and the Blood Demon Yue, the three of them.</p><p></p><p>Li Shueyan and the Blood Demon Yue silently followed behind, not daring to disturb the young man in front, who was carefully examining a scroll.</p><p></p><p>Lu Changsheng walked while looking at the scroll in his hand, or it would be more appropriate to call it a route map.</p><p></p><p>"The Divine-Demonic Battlefield..." Lu Changsheng murmured softly as he looked at the huge mark on the route map.</p><p></p><p>Even though he was immortal, there were still countless places he had not been to, after all, the boundless void could be said to be infinite.</p><p></p><p>According to what Jian Wuhui said, the Divine-Demonic Battlefield should be the place where all tribes wage war, which sounded quite interesting.</p><p></p><p>From Jian Wuhui's words, it was not difficult to see that the human race was not doing well there.</p><p></p><p>Lu Changsheng's gaze slightly changed, although he was not sure whether he was part of the human race or not, he had always been dealing with the human race, and had made a few human friends in the past, but they had long since died in the river of time.</p><p></p><p>Therefore, he later became alone, no longer making friends, feeling that it was unnecessary.</p><p></p><p>After all, they would all die eventually, no need to add sorrow for the subsequent separation of life and death.</p><p></p><p>"Can you still find your home?" Lu Changsheng lowered his head and asked casually.</p><p></p><p>Li Shueyan and the Blood Demon Yue were taken aback.</p><p></p><p>The Blood Demon Yue quickly reacted, realizing that the master was asking her, so she hurriedly bowed and said, "Master, Demon Yue... can't remember."</p><p></p><p>Lu Changsheng turned around and stared at the Blood Demon Yue without speaking for a long time.</p><p></p><p>Li Shueyan obediently lowered his head.</p><p></p><p>The Blood Demon Yue, seeing that Lu Changsheng did not speak for a long time, carefully raised her head and saw Lu Changsheng quietly looking at her.</p><p></p><p>This was the first time she had clearly seen her master's appearance since the ancient Demon Sword Clan was destroyed.</p><p></p><p>Handsome and extraordinary, transcendent like a fallen immortal, with the appearance of a gentle young immortal, and when he smiled, he was like a big brother next door.</p><p></p><p>It was really difficult to compare him to the overlord who had destroyed the ancient Demon Sword Clan.</p><p></p><p>"Master... Master..." the Blood Demon Yue lowered her head, her voice slightly trembling.</p><p></p><p>"Blood Demon Yue, do you know why I summoned you from the Ancient Moon Blood Clan?" Lu Changsheng asked softly.</p><p></p><p>"I don't know." The Blood Demon Yue had just answered when she suddenly remembered the destruction of the ancient Demon Sword Clan, her pupils shrank, and she quickly looked up at Lu Changsheng.</p><p></p><p>Lu Changsheng: "This time, destroy the Ancient Moon."</p><p></p><p>The Blood Demon Yue's mind shook, and she said in a low voice, "Demon Yue respects and obeys any decision of the master."</p><p></p><p>At this moment, she clearly knew what she was saying.</p><p></p><p>But... she just couldn't resist, her heart only wanted to serve the master infinitely.</p><p></p><p>Lu Changsheng nodded and smiled, "You will also die then."</p><p></p><p>The Blood Demon Yue's pupils trembled, but she still said, "Demon Yue respects and obeys any decision of the master..."</p><p></p><p>Next to her, Li Shueyan slightly pursed his lips, his heart somewhat complicated.</p><p></p><p>Lu Changsheng nodded slightly, looked up at the sky, and after learning about the Divine-Demonic Battlefield, he had a strange feeling in his heart, as if he wanted to go and take a look...</p><p></p><p>Thinking of this, he also lost his playful mood and did not want to stay in the Eternal Void Realm for long.</p><p></p><p>Lu Changsheng looked at the boundless sky, his palm slightly clenched, and just as he was about to tear open the Eternal Void Realm's Dao, the corner of his mouth slightly rose, it seemed he didn't need to do it himself.</p><p></p><p>Li Shueyan and the Blood Demon Yue were puzzled by Lu Changsheng's actions, not understanding.</p><p></p><p>But the next moment, a faint and indifferent voice suddenly resounded in this realm, no, not just in this realm,</p><p></p><p>Here is the full English translation of the Chinese excerpt:</p><p></p><p>"It resounded throughout the entire Eternal Cosmos Realm!</p><p></p><p>New 69 Book Bar ‚Üí 69shux.com</p><p></p><p>"I am the Primal Source of the Dao of the Eternal Cosmos Realm," </p><p></p><p>In the Ancient Desolate Ruins, the Moon and Star Domain, the Fallen Immortal Continent, the Chaotic Demon Sea, the Sacred Light Ancient Realm, the Endless Great Desert, and the Heavenly Abyss Ancient Realm - the countless living beings in these eight great domains were suddenly filled with panic and profound bewilderment as they looked towards the sky!</p><p></p><p>The Eternal Cosmos Realm... the Primal Source of the Dao?</p><p></p><p>What has happened?</p><p></p><p>They naturally knew of the existence of the Dao, but the Dao of the Eternal Cosmos Realm had always been formless and silent. For it to suddenly speak was unprecedented!</p><p></p><p>Within the Ancient Desolate Ruins, experts at the Divine Storehouse Realm like Duan Jiuxiong, the Patriarch of the Nangong Clan, and Miao Hantian were all shocked and their eyes flickered with madness as they gazed at the sky.</p><p></p><p>Goodness, just when one crisis was resolved, another one arises - even the Primal Source of the Dao has appeared!</p><p></p><p>As the sole great world within the known boundless void of the Eternal Cosmos Realm, the power of its Primal Source of the Dao is unimaginable!</p><p></p><p>Could it be that the destruction of the Ancient Desolate Sword Clan has alarmed the Primal Source of the Dao?</p><p></p><p>It should be the case, after all, as the Primal Source of the Dao, it would not be surprising if the destruction of the Ancient Desolate Sword Clan happened right under its nose.</p><p></p><p>The Primal Source of the Dao must be aware of the situation.</p><p></p><p>However, it is well known in the Eternal Cosmos Realm that the Primal Source of the Dao and the Eight Ancient Clans have always been on opposing sides.</p><p></p><p>Logically speaking, since the Ancient Desolate Sword Clan was destroyed by Senior Qingyi, the Primal Source of the Dao should not interfere, and might even secretly chuckle about it.</p><p></p><p>But what is the reason...?</p><p></p><p>Duan Jiuxiong and the others were filled with doubts, but that did not stop their hearts from pounding.</p><p></p><p>At the same time,</p><p></p><p>The other seven Ancient Clans scattered throughout the Eternal Cosmos Realm were also in a state of unrest.</p><p></p><p>Powerful auras surged out from the small spatial domains of their respective clan groups, standing tall in the distant skies.</p><p></p><p>These peak experts - some with wolf-like faces and human bodies, some with great wings on their backs, some covered in beast-like armor, some with gaping abyssal mouths and bloodthirsty gazes, and some even with bald heads like Li Shuyan - all had the same solemn and perplexed expression on their faces.</p><p></p><p>They did not understand what the Primal Source of the Dao was up to?</p><p></p><p>Recently, as far as they knew, none of the Eight Ancient Clans had provoked the Dao, right?</p><p></p><p>At this moment, the Primal Source of the Dao spoke again, its tone becoming increasingly indifferent:</p><p></p><p>"I have always coexisted peacefully with the Eight Ancient Clans, but two Dao Lords have just informed me that some experts from the Eight Ancient Clans have recently slain five Middle Realm Dao Lords in the boundless void. I would like to ask, what are the intentions of your Eight Ancient Clans?"</p><p></p><p>Boom!</p><p></p><p>With these words, it undoubtedly caused a massive upheaval throughout the entire Eternal Cosmos Realm!!</p><p></p><p>Slaying five Middle Realm Dao Lords!!</p><p></p><p>How utterly unimaginable?</p><p></p><p>Indeed, in everyone's understanding, only the Eight Ancient Clans would be capable of such a terrifying feat!</p><p></p><p>Within the Startling Cloud City, countless cultivators were also standing in the air, eagerly discussing the matter while eating melons.</p><p></p><p>"Whew, the Eight Ancient Clans are truly hegemon-level existences, to be able to slay Dao Lords, they are too powerful."</p><p></p><p>"I wonder which Ancient Clan was responsible? In my opinion, it must be either the Void Ancient Beast King Clan or our own Ancient Desolate Sword Clan."</p><p></p><p>"..."</p><p></p><p>Since Startling Cloud City was remote, the news of the destruction of the Ancient Desolate Sword Clan had not yet reached them.</p><p></p><p>And even if Liu Tu and the others had returned, they had not been spreading the news around.</p><p></p><p>Liu Tu, Liu Qing, Fu Liangcai, and the others were also standing in the air, furrowing their brows as they listened to the words of the Dao.</p><p></p><p>Suddenly, Fu Tao noticed that Fu Shiyu's expression was off, and couldn't help but ask in puzzlement, "Sister, what's wrong with you?"</p>

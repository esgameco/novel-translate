        <h1>Chapter 276</h1>
        <div class="content">
            <p>Here is the full English translation of the Chinese excerpt:</p><p></p><p>Seeing this, Fu Liangcai nodded silently, and after a moment of contemplation, he asked in a solemn voice, </p><p></p><p>"Fellow Daoist Lu, you are seeking the Ancient Wasteland Sword Clan because..."</p><p></p><p>"I am a sword cultivator, and I have heard that the Ancestral Patriarch of your realm's Ancient Wasteland Sword Clan is highly skilled in the Dao of the Sword, so I wish to go and seek guidance from them." Lü Changsheng said earnestly.</p><p></p><p>"......" Fu Liangcai swallowed.</p><p></p><p>He felt both relieved and amused at the same time.</p><p></p><p>He had previously been suspicious about why Fellow Daoist Lu was seeking the Ancient Wasteland Sword Clan, but now he understood the reason.</p><p></p><p>Presumably, he had learned about the Ancient Wasteland Sword Clan from Shi Yu and thus developed this idea.</p><p></p><p>"Fellow Daoist Lu, I observe that your cultivation is also profound, and you may even not be weaker than me," Fu Liangcai said with a smile.</p><p></p><p>"Mm." Lü Changsheng neither confirmed nor denied it.</p><p></p><p>Seeing this, Fu Liangcai shook his head and sighed, "But Fellow Daoist Lu... you come from the outside world and do not know the true strength of the Ancient Wasteland Sword Clan at all..."</p><p></p><p>"How strong are they?" Lü Changsheng asked.</p><p></p><p>"Extremely strong, their power is at a level that even we can only look up to in awe. Fellow Daoist Lu, I presume you have heard of the Heavenly Dao?" Fu Liangcai said with a sigh.</p><p></p><p>"I have heard of it briefly." Lü Changsheng nodded lightly.</p><p></p><p>Fu Liangcai's face was filled with trepidation as he took a deep breath and said, "The Ancient Wasteland Sword Clan... can actually rival the Heavenly Dao..."</p><p></p><p>After saying this, Fu Liangcai looked straight at Lü Changsheng. Although his bronze mask concealed his expression, it was clear that he was frightened.</p><p></p><p>After five breaths, Lü Changsheng suddenly said in a casual manner, "Patriarch Fu, hearing you say this, I do have a question."</p><p></p><p>Fu Liangcai was slightly taken aback: "Fellow Daoist Lu, please feel free to ask, I will answer to the best of my knowledge."</p><p></p><p>"Since the Eight Great Ancient Clans can rival the Heavenly Dao, then in this Eternal Realm, is it the Heavenly Dao that has the final say, or is it the Eight Great Ancient Clans?" Lü Changsheng asked calmly as he sipped his tea.</p><p></p><p>Fu Liangcai was taken aback. He actually didn't know the answer to this.</p><p></p><p>Logically speaking, as the Eternal Realm is a great world, its fundamental Heavenly Dao should be unrivaled... But he had never heard of any conflicts between the Heavenly Dao and the Eight Great Ancient Clans.</p><p></p><p>"I apologize, Fellow Daoist Lu, my knowledge is limited, as we are just a small city, Xuanyun City, within the Ancient Wasteland Ruins," Fu Liangcai said somewhat embarrassedly.</p><p></p><p>Lü Changsheng smiled and said, "Alright, let's not discuss this. Just tell me how I can meet the Ancient Wasteland Sword Clan."</p><p></p><p>"Fellow Daoist Lu..." Fu Liangcai hesitated.</p><p></p><p>"I just want to take a look." Lü Changsheng said.</p><p></p><p>"Well then, Fellow Daoist Lu, in our Ancient Wasteland Ruins, the Ancient Wasteland Sword Clan is extremely mysterious. The only chance to see them is perhaps once every 200,000 years!</p><p></p><p>That would be during the Heavenly Apex Assembly held by our Ancient Wasteland Ruins once every 200,000 years, and the host of the Heavenly Apex Assembly is none other than the Ancient Wasteland Sword Clan!</p><p></p><p>I recall that in the last Heavenly Apex Assembly, the top ten Heavenly Apexes were granted an audience with the powerful cultivators of the Ancient Wasteland Sword Clan," Fu Liangcai contemplated.</p><p></p><p>Lü Changsheng's eyes flickered as he asked, "What is the purpose of holding this Heavenly Apex Assembly, and how long until the next one?"</p><p></p><p>"The purpose? The purpose is for the Ancient Wasteland Sword Clan to recruit sword servants, or to put it bluntly, servants. But to become one of these servants, one must be among the top ten in the Heavenly Apex Assembly, which is the top ten among all the Heavenly Apexes in the Ancient Wasteland Ruins. How terrifying is that!</p><p></p><p>But even just being a sword servant is something all Heavenly Apexes eagerly pursue. To become a sword servant of the Ancient Wasteland Sword Clan would be akin to reaching the pinnacle of one's aspirations."</p><p></p><p>Saying this, Fu Liangcai smiled and continued, "Fellow Daoist Lu, you're in luck. The next Heavenly Apex Assembly will begin in a hundred years."</p><p></p><p>Lü Changsheng...</p><p></p><p>Here is my translation of the Chinese excerpt you provided:</p><p></p><p>He nodded and let out a long sigh, saying:</p><p></p><p>"The Ancient Wasteland Sword Clan has quite a clever scheme, using the once-in-twenty-thousand-years Grand Gathering of Prodigies to recruit the top talents from the Ancient Wasteland Ruins back into their clan. Over time, the Ancient Wasteland Ruins will inevitably suffer from a brain drain - isn't this a form of suppression and exploitation?</p><p></p><p>New 69 Book Bar 99shu.com</p><p></p><p>In the long run, the Ancient Wasteland Sword Clan will be able to firmly maintain its position as the hegemon of the Ancient Wasteland Ruins, with no one able to shake them."</p><p></p><p>Hearing this, Fu Liangcai was stunned, his mouth agape, pausing for a moment. </p><p></p><p>Finally, he seemed to have a sudden realization, letting out a wry smile.</p><p></p><p>"What you say is absolutely right, but we seem to have no choice, and have even come to see becoming a sword servant of the Ancient Wasteland Sword Clan as the highest honor," he chuckled.</p><p></p><p>Lu Changsheng smiled and said, "Since there is still a hundred years, may I trouble you for the next hundred years?"</p><p></p><p>Fu Liangcai waved his hand and said, "A hundred years is nothing, it will pass in the blink of an eye. As long as you, Sir Lu, are willing, you can stay in my Fu Clan for a thousand or even ten thousand years, haha."</p><p></p><p>"Good," Lu Changsheng nodded slightly.</p><p></p><p>"Then I shall not disturb you further. Sir Lu, please rest well," Fu Liangcai said with a smile, cupping his hands and leaving the room.</p><p></p><p>...</p><p></p><p>As soon as Fu Liangcai stepped out the door, his expression changed!</p><p></p><p>The Grand Elder asked in alarm, "Clan Leader, what's wrong?"</p><p></p><p>"The Ancestor...!" Fu Liangcai's eyes were trembling as he quickly grabbed the ashen-faced Grand Elder and disappeared from the guest room.</p><p></p><p>Seeing this, Li Shuyan scratched his head, wondering what was going on with this "Ancestor".</p><p></p><p>"Shuyan."</p><p></p><p>Suddenly, Lu Changsheng's summons came from inside the room. Li Shuyan hurriedly pushed open the door and entered, bowing before Lu Changsheng. "Master, what are your instructions?"</p><p></p><p>"The Grand Gathering of Prodigies in the Ancient Wasteland Ruins will begin in a hundred years..."</p><p></p><p>Lu Changsheng then briefly explained the matter of the Grand Gathering to Li Shuyan.</p><p></p><p>"Master, are you letting me participate in the Grand Gathering?" Li Shuyan's eyes widened.</p><p></p><p>Li Shuyan's heart grew heavy. Although he was a peak figure in the Ancestral Heavenly Realm, he might not fare so easily in this Grand Gathering.</p><p></p><p>However, this was also a path to becoming stronger, so he naturally would not refuse, nor dare to refuse.</p><p></p><p>"No, I will also participate," Lu Changsheng said calmly.</p><p></p><p>Li Shuyan: "......"</p><p></p><p>Master, you are already a peerless figure who has severed the Heavenly Dao, why would you participate in this Grand Gathering?</p><p></p><p>Suddenly, Li Shuyan seemed to have realized something.</p><p></p><p>Could it be...!</p><p></p><p>"Master, your purpose is the Ancient Wasteland Sword Clan!" Li Shuyan blurted out.</p><p></p><p>Lu Changsheng frowned slightly: "You are not as perceptive as the former Mirror Observation."</p><p></p><p>Li Shuyan felt awkward and smiled, "Master, Mirror Observation wasn't actually that perceptive either. He just relied on that relic, which I've already given to Huihai."</p><p></p><p>Lu Changsheng rubbed his temples and waved his hand, "I'm tired and need to rest. You go stand guard at the door."</p><p></p><p>...</p><p></p><p>"Ancestor!! Ancestor!!" </p><p></p><p>In the depths of the Fu Clan, in a quiet chamber, Fu Liangcai, the elders, as well as Fu Shiyu and Fu Tao, had solemn expressions.</p><p></p><p>Before them, a withered old man was seated in meditation, his breath completely gone.</p><p></p><p>"This is not the time to grieve!" Fu Liangcai suddenly swept his sleeve, his face becoming anxious and ferocious. "Elders, hear my command - the entire clan must prepare for battle!"</p><p></p><p>"Yes!"</p><p></p><p>At the same time, the radiant sun's shadow that had been protecting the Fu Clan gradually faded away...</p><p></p><p>This signified that the Clan's Ancestor had passed away.</p><p></p><p>A Saint-Yang Realm expert had fallen!</p><p></p><p>Boom!</p><p></p><p>The entire Dragoncloud City trembled, and countless gazes turned towards the Ouyang Clan and the Liu Clan!</p><p></p><p>The battle between the great clans was about to begin!</p>

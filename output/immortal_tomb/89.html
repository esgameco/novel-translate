        <h1>Chapter 89</h1>
        <div class="content">
            <p>Here is the full English translation of the Chinese excerpt:</p><p></p><p>"Mister... Mister?" </p><p></p><p>The old woman looked at Lu Changsheng and murmured. Although she had been blind before and had never seen Lu Changsheng's appearance, his voice was too familiar to her. Seeing the incredible scene just now, she was even more certain that her miraculous recovery of sight was related to Lu Changsheng.</p><p></p><p>Lu Changsheng nodded with a smile: "That's right, it's me."</p><p></p><p>Confirmed, the old woman became visibly excited. She pointed to her eyes and stammered a bit: "Mister, my eyes are...?"</p><p></p><p>Lu Changsheng nodded slightly, casually creating a barrier, and said, "There are demonic beasts rampaging outside, you should stay here for now, and I'll let you out later."</p><p></p><p>Lu Changsheng glanced at the unconscious Tong in the old woman's arms, then disappeared in a flash without waiting for her to speak.</p><p></p><p>...</p><p></p><p>Outside the Palace of the Water King.</p><p></p><p>Just as the Second Elder led the disciples to fight fiercely against the demonic beasts, a mocking laughter suddenly rang out in the air.</p><p></p><p>"Heh, is this the declining Lishui Empire where my Demon Realm's Great Earth Dragon Bear Demon is about to fall? It's nothing special at all..."</p><p></p><p>The next moment, a young man with a bare upper body appeared in midair.</p><p></p><p>The Demon King, the Fierce Soaring Snake!</p><p></p><p>The capital city suddenly fell silent, and the battle immediately subsided. All the demonic beasts knelt down and respectfully called out, "Hail the Fierce Soaring Snake Demon King!"</p><p></p><p>The majestic momentum was overwhelming!</p><p></p><p>This scene terrified everyone.</p><p></p><p>The Second Elder of the Blue Cloud Sect hurriedly led the disciples back to the palace. He stared at the figure in the air, his expression extremely grave.</p><p></p><p>"Elder Brother."</p><p></p><p>Lin Dong came to Tong Xin's side.</p><p></p><p>"Little brother, are you alright?" Tong Xin quickly checked Lin Dong's body and was relieved to see that he was unharmed.</p><p></p><p>"I'm fine, Elder Brother, is today going to be difficult..." Lin Dong looked at the figure in the air and asked in a low voice.</p><p></p><p>Tong Xin sighed and patted his shoulder without saying anything.</p><p></p><p>The King of Lishui and the officials cowered behind, daring not to make a sound. They were all deathly pale, imagining how terrifying this young man, whom the demonic beasts called the Demon King, must be.</p><p></p><p>"Fierce Soaring Snake Demon King, it's an honor." The Second Elder cupped his hands and sneered, "Unexpectedly, the great Fierce Soaring Snake Demon King would personally come to this small Lishui. You really think highly of us."</p><p></p><p>At the same time, his fist in the sleeve was clenched tightly. If this Fierce Soaring Snake Demon King attacked, it would be a devastating blow to them. The capital might not even last a moment!</p><p></p><p>"Hehe, the demon and human realms have invaded Lishui several times, but they were all cleverly resolved. You don't want to tell me it was your little Blue Cloud Sect who did it, do you?" The Fierce Soaring Snake's eyes narrowed slightly, speaking indifferently.</p><p></p><p>The Second Elder's body trembled, and the image of the blue-robed figure flashed in his mind. He pursed his lips and didn't say anything.</p><p></p><p>"Not saying? Then I'll just have to search your soul myself!" The Fierce Soaring Snake let out a bloodthirsty smile and raised his hand towards the Second Elder, who was then suddenly flung towards him.</p><p></p><p>"Second Elder!!"</p><p></p><p>Tong Xin and the other disciples were about to act, but the Second Elder shouted, "Don't act rashly!"</p><p></p><p>Soon, the Fierce Soaring Snake had the Second Elder by the neck. Without a word, he was about to press his finger to the Second Elder's forehead, when suddenly an old, hunchbacked man appeared between the Fierce Soaring Snake and the Second Elder, using two fingers to lightly pinch the Fierce Soaring Snake's index finger...</p><p></p><p>And then decisively twisted it!</p><p></p><p>Crack!</p><p></p><p>The Fierce Soaring Snake's index finger was completely snapped off and detached.</p><p></p><p>This all happened in an instant.</p><p></p><p>"Tsk!" </p><p></p><p>The Fierce Soaring Snake hissed in pain, retreating in shock, and glared at the hunchbacked old man, growling, "Who are you? Are you the one who's been interfering with my Demon Realm's affairs in Lishui Empire?!"</p><p></p><p>"Elder!" </p><p></p><p>Tong Xin and Lin Dong were delighted, for they recognized this hunchbacked old man! </p><p></p><p>And some of the Foundation Building disciples also showed joy, as they had seen him on the town wall in Moyu Town that year.</p><p></p><p>Here is the full English translation of the Chinese excerpt:</p><p></p><p>The impression left by this powerful old hunchbacked man was extremely deep. I never expected him to appear again after so many years!!</p><p></p><p>"Senior, thank you for the rescue, who are you?" The Second Elder regained his composure, took a deep breath, and asked respectfully.</p><p></p><p>"It's nothing, go back, don't interfere with your Grandpa Turtle's performance."</p><p></p><p>The old turtle waved his hand lazily.</p><p></p><p>"Uh, yes, yes, yes." The Second Elder immediately retreated.</p><p></p><p>At this moment, everyone was looking at the suspended Fierce Soaring Snake and the old turtle.</p><p></p><p>The old turtle looked at the Fierce Soaring Snake and said mockingly, "Who am I? I'm your Grandpa Turtle! Hurry up and come kneel down to lick my shoes!"</p><p></p><p>Since Luchang was not present, he wanted to have a good rant! To satisfy his urge to talk!</p><p></p><p>As he spoke, the old turtle even took out a chair and placed it in mid-air, then sat down in front of everyone's bewildered gaze, crossing his legs arrogantly and shaking them.</p><p></p><p>Filled with an air of supreme arrogance!</p><p></p><p>All the demonic beasts: "......"</p><p></p><p>Everyone: "......"</p><p></p><p>Weren't they in a life-and-death battle? Why did the scene suddenly feel less solemn?</p><p></p><p>"You want this king to lick your shoes?" The Fierce Soaring Snake pointed at himself, asking in disbelief.</p><p></p><p>The old turtle: "Yes, it's you."</p><p></p><p>"Haha!" The Fierce Soaring Snake threw his head back and laughed wildly, then suddenly stopped, saying coldly, "Do you know who I am?"</p><p></p><p>The old turtle was not at all anxious, smiling and saying, "Oh, who are you? Grandpa Turtle has limited knowledge, why don't you tell me?"</p><p></p><p>"Hmph! I am the Demonic Realm, the Fierce Soaring Snake King!!" </p><p></p><p>Clap, clap, clap, clap...</p><p></p><p>The old turtle clapped his hands and said solemnly, "Impressive."</p><p></p><p>The Fierce Soaring Snake's eyes darkened. He felt that the hunchbacked old man was mocking him, but he was not entirely sure!</p><p></p><p>"Are you mocking me?" The Fierce Soaring Snake asked uncertainly.</p><p></p><p>"No, no, no, why would Grandpa Turtle mock you..."</p><p></p><p>The old turtle suddenly changed expression, his eyes flashing with an eerie green light, and he roared at the Fierce Soaring Snake, "Hurry up and come lick your Grandpa Turtle's shoes?!"</p><p></p><p>The Fierce Soaring Snake's face just started to show anger, but his eyes suddenly became empty...</p><p></p><p>The next moment, he went towards the old turtle like a machine, slowly squatting down, hugging the old turtle's foot, and frantically licking his shoes!</p><p></p><p>Slurp, slurp...</p><p></p><p>Everyone: "......"</p><p></p><p>All the demonic beasts: "......"</p><p></p><p>Faced with such a bizarre and absurd situation, their brains had crashed.</p><p></p><p>At this time, the old turtle's face did not show any smugness, but was warily observing the surroundings!</p><p></p><p>Something was wrong, very wrong, why did he feel that the master was nearby...</p><p></p><p>"I've noticed that no matter what you do, you're always hesitant and need to be told several times. It's useless."</p><p></p><p>Suddenly, a faint voice sounded behind the old turtle.</p><p></p><p>The old turtle's scalp tingled, and his turtle head twisted 360 degrees behind him. He laughed stiffly, "Master, I was just about to let him finish licking the shoes and then kill him..."</p><p></p><p>Luchang nodded and smiled kindly at the old turtle, then suddenly slapped him.</p><p></p><p>Boom!!!</p><p></p><p>Even before the palm strike reached, the frantically licking Fierce Soaring Snake suddenly exploded into a mist of blood, and all the demonic beasts in the area were instantly reduced to nothingness.</p><p></p><p>"Master, Grandpa Turtle... Oops, I was wrong!!"</p><p></p><p>The old turtle's face turned deathly pale, and before he could finish speaking, he was hit by the palm strike.</p><p></p><p>He quickly transformed into his turtle body to receive the blow!</p><p></p><p>Boom!!</p><p></p><p>The palm strike did not shatter his turtle shell, but violently slammed him into the ground from midair!</p><p></p><p>At this moment, the ground shook violently, as if the entire Lingchen Realm was affected.</p><p></p><p>Underground,</p><p></p><p>A palm strike could be seen, pressing down on the turtle shell and rushing through the core of the earth at a speed beyond the limits of light.</p><p></p><p>Soon, the turtle shell pierced through the entire earth, broke through the wall of the Lingchen Realm, and shot out of the Lingchen Realm.</p><p></p><p>Whoosh, it continued to shoot out.</p><p></p><p>"Master!! Wait for me, I'll come back!!" </p><p></p><p>The turtle shell became a tiny white light in the vast starry sky, and with a clang, disappeared from sight.</p>

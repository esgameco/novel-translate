        <h1>Chapter 59</h1>
        <div class="content">
            <p>Here is the full English translation of the Chinese excerpt:</p><p></p><p>The old turtle's aged eyes narrowed slightly, a cold glint flashing through them. ‚ô®‚ôñ‚ûÖ‚ùæ‚ì¢ùî•√πùìç.ƒÜ‚ìûùïÑüò≤üò≥</p><p></p><p>This little demon is quite brave, daring to point a spear at the master.</p><p></p><p>Zhao Shenyuan didn't know that at this moment, he had already been placed on the old turtle's hit list.</p><p></p><p>Lu Changsheng looked at the spear pointed at him and suddenly smiled.</p><p></p><p>How interesting...</p><p></p><p>He then quietly looked at Zhao Shenyuan, raised his hand and grasped the demon spear, gently bending it...</p><p></p><p>Zhao Shenyuan first froze, then his pupils shrank tightly, until they became needle-like!</p><p></p><p>The demon spear was bent into a half-moon shape, just like a drawn bow...</p><p></p><p>Finally, with a crisp snap, it broke in front of Gu Helin's and Zhao Shenyuan's horrified gaze!!</p><p></p><p>Accompanying this was Zhao Shenyuan's cry of pain. In that instant, the arm holding the demon spear was broken...</p><p></p><p>Zhao Shenyuan clutched his shoulder and stumbled back a step, his eyes trembling as he looked at the broken demon spear on the ground.</p><p></p><p>To forcibly break the demon spear like this, what inhuman strength was this.</p><p></p><p>He doubted whether even the Demon Venerable could do it.</p><p></p><p>He slowly raised his head and dryly looked at Lu Changsheng, finally able to sense the other's aura, which was as hazy as chaos...</p><p></p><p>He couldn't help but tremble again in his heart.</p><p></p><p>Damn, he had been careless.</p><p></p><p>"You... who are you exactly?"</p><p></p><p>Zhao Shenyuan's tone was very unstable, his mind completely in disarray. How could there be such a mysterious and powerful cultivator in the Lingchen Realm?</p><p></p><p>If it were before, he might still think the other had some hidden treasure.</p><p></p><p>But the fact that the demon spear was broken was right in front of him, he was not a fool, naturally understanding that the young man in the robe must be an absolute powerhouse!</p><p></p><p>"Old Turtle, you take care of it." </p><p></p><p>Lu Changsheng glanced in the direction of Moyu Town, waved his sleeve, and disappeared from the scene with Gu Helin.</p><p></p><p>Zhao Shenyuan's heart suddenly contracted, warily staring at the old turtle!</p><p></p><p>"Hehe, you little demon are quite brave, daring to point a spear at the master?"</p><p></p><p>The old turtle looked at Zhao Shenyuan with a sinister smile on his face.</p><p></p><p>"Who are you guys exactly..."</p><p></p><p>Zhao Shenyuan asked in a somewhat low voice, his demonic qi surging, ready to attack or flee at the slightest sign of trouble.</p><p></p><p>"If you say the master is a Immortal Emperor, Grandpa Turtle is afraid you won't understand. I can only tell you that the bigshots in the great world you'll ascend to will have to respectfully serve the master..."</p><p></p><p>The old turtle sneered lightly.</p><p></p><p>Zhao Shenyuan's soul shook, his mouth slightly open, his face suddenly turning deathly pale.</p><p></p><p>But soon, he shook his head and said in a deep voice, "Nonsense!"</p><p></p><p>"Hehe, frog in the well."</p><p></p><p>The old turtle's eyes suddenly became bloodthirsty, looking like a complete villain!</p><p></p><p>He stretched out his palm and lightly pressed it towards Zhao Shenyuan...</p><p></p><p>The next moment,</p><p></p><p>Boom!!</p><p></p><p>Zhao Shenyuan's expression changed drastically, his body suddenly pressed down to the ground, like a lamb awaiting slaughter.</p><p></p><p>The previously somewhat calm him was now completely panicked and terrified, his eyes filled with fear.</p><p></p><p>Pitter-patter...</p><p></p><p>"Oh ho, can't move anymore?" The old turtle walked in front of Zhao Shenyuan and looked down at him indifferently, "This is only one-hundred-thousandth of Grandpa Turtle's pressure, and you can't even handle it?"</p><p></p><p>Zhao Shenyuan's pupils trembled violently, a great fear rising in his heart.</p><p></p><p>He regretted it, if he had known there would be such a terrifying variable, he wouldn't have come...</p><p></p><p>"Even an old servant like Grandpa Turtle is this strong... Now do you know the identity of the person your spear was just pointing at?"</p><p></p><p>As the old turtle chuckled, he slowly raised his foot.</p><p></p><p>Hearing those horrifying words, Zhao Shenyuan's heart was filled with immense fear.</p><p></p><p>Here is the full English translation of the Chinese novel excerpt:</p><p></p><p>He looked at the slowly descending foot, his neck veins bulging, and he desperately tried to beg for mercy by moving his mouth, but he was suppressed and couldn't utter a word.</p><p></p><p>"From the moment you pointed that long spear, you had no chance of surviving," </p><p></p><p>The old turtle suddenly increased its speed and stomped down hard!!</p><p></p><p>Boom!!</p><p></p><p>Zhao Shenyuan's head and body instantly exploded, </p><p></p><p>causing the entire mountain range to tremble.</p><p></p><p>After the commotion settled, the old turtle looked at the long demonic spear that had been broken in half, and with a palm strike, reduced it to dust. </p><p></p><p>Finally, it disappeared in a flash.</p><p></p><p>...........</p><p></p><p>"Help! Who can save us!"</p><p></p><p>"Lord of the town! Please save us!"</p><p></p><p>"Where is the immortal? Doesn't our town have an immortal living here? Where is he? Can he really just watch us suffer under the torment of demons?"</p><p></p><p>"Ah, the immortal won't care about us. There are so many demons, I bet the immortal has already fled long ago."</p><p></p><p>"........"</p><p></p><p>In Moyu Town, demonic energy was rampaging, with panicked figures rushing through the streets.</p><p></p><p>"Hahaha......"</p><p></p><p>Wherever the black mist passed, some townspeople instantly had their flesh and blood dissolve, leaving only white bones.</p><p></p><p>This scene utterly terrified the townspeople.</p><p></p><p>On the town wall, Chen Dadao and the town guards were assisting Tong Xin and Lin Dong in fiercely resisting the demonic beasts. They were more or less covered in blood.</p><p></p><p>"Junior brother, your cultivation is still shallow, go hide first!"</p><p></p><p>Tong Xin shouted, his hands forming seals to control his sword, his face deathly pale.</p><p></p><p>Lin Dong silently shook his head.</p><p></p><p>Tong Xin sighed, glancing at the distant mountains, praying, "Master, Senior, please hurry..."</p><p></p><p>These were just minor monsters, and he could barely hold them off. If stronger ones appeared, it would be the end.</p><p></p><p>Just then, Tong Xin saw countless demonic beast shadows emerging in the distance, rushing towards Moyu Town like a tidal wave.</p><p></p><p>Roar!!!</p><p></p><p>This completely terrified Tong Xin and Lin Dong!</p><p>They couldn't even handle these demons, and now even more demonic beasts were coming.</p><p>What kind of day was this? Had the demonic and immortal realms begun a full-scale invasion?</p><p></p><p>At the same time, </p><p>high in the sky,</p><p>three figures stood in the air.</p><p>However, Gu Helin was being supported by the old turtle with one hand.</p><p></p><p>Gu Helin looked at the dire situation below, then at the approaching demonic beasts in the distance, his heart clenching. He turned his gaze with difficulty to the leading Lu Changsheng, weakly and hoarsely asking,</p><p></p><p>"Senior, are we... not going down?"</p><p></p><p>Gu Helin had just weathered a tribulation, his body heavily injured, and he had no strength left. Now, he could only place his hopes on Lu Changsheng and the old turtle.</p><p>He knew that as long as the Senior took action, all the suffering here would be resolved.</p><p></p><p>Lu Changsheng seemed to have not heard, silently observing the scene below.</p><p></p><p>The old turtle glanced at Gu Helin and sneered, "Didn't you hear those roars just now?"</p><p></p><p>Gu Helin lowered his head, remembering those words.</p><p></p><p>"Most of the people down there are frankly no concern of mine or the Master's. Whether they are saved or not doesn't matter. But they do have some connection to your sect. So, you can go down and save them."</p><p></p><p>The old turtle said with a strange smile.</p><p></p><p>"Senior, Helin has no strength left," Gu Helin said shamefully.</p><p></p><p>"Since you have no strength, then just watch obediently. The Master has his own plans. In the eyes of this old turtle, those who stand on the moral high ground..."</p><p></p><p>The old turtle hadn't finished speaking when the silent Lu Changsheng suddenly interjected, softly saying,</p><p></p><p>"What's the harm in a few of them dying?"</p>

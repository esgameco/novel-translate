        <h1>Chapter 60</h1>
        <div class="content">
            <p>Here is the full English translation of the Chinese excerpt:</p><p></p><p>Gu Helin was stunned. üêºüíö6‚ûà·îïùêáùï¶ùìß.ùïîœÉùêåüç´üò≤</p><p></p><p>Finally, he let out an embarrassed sigh, "Sir, it was Helin's lack of foresight."</p><p></p><p>After saying that, he stuffed another pill into his mouth again, closed his eyes, and began to frantically refine the medicinal power.</p><p></p><p>The old turtle looked at the closed-eyed Gu Helin and sighed helplessly.</p><p></p><p>He finally understood why Lu Changsheng had been quite caring towards this Gu Helin.</p><p></p><p>Whether they were cultivators in this Mortal Realm or cultivators and immortals in the Immortal Realm, in fact, the vast majority of them were extremely cold-blooded. </p><p></p><p>They viewed the common people as mere ants, with life and death all within a single thought.</p><p></p><p>But this Gu Helin, being a cultivator, had an extremely rare childlike heart.</p><p></p><p>The path of cultivation is perilous, and it is unknown how he could maintain this sincerity, let alone how long he could keep it...</p><p></p><p>Lu Changsheng turned around and looked at Gu Helin, then gestured to the old turtle.</p><p></p><p>The old turtle immediately understood, and with a finger, he infused a warm aura into Gu Helin's chest.</p><p></p><p>Gu Helin noticed the accelerated recovery in his body and was stunned.</p><p></p><p>How could the pill he refined be this effective!</p><p></p><p>He suddenly opened his eyes and quickly saw the finger on his chest.</p><p></p><p>"Thank you, senior. What you said earlier is absolutely right. For you and Sir, these people are not worth saving, but for Helin, this is the territory of our sect, and I..."</p><p></p><p>Gu Helin said with some excitement in his voice, his complexion flushed, indicating an excellent recovery.</p><p></p><p>"You may go down."</p><p></p><p>Lu Changsheng said softly from above.</p><p></p><p>"...Yes."</p><p></p><p>Gu Helin bowed slightly and then shot down like a beam of light!</p><p></p><p>At the same time, the embryonic spirit within him trembled, and the overwhelming pressure of the embryonic spirit instantly covered the entire Moyu Town!</p><p></p><p>In just a moment, the rampaging demonic beasts in and around the town were frozen in place and unable to move. They unanimously looked up at the beam of light in the sky, their hearts filled with terror.</p><p></p><p>An ancestral embryonic spirit!</p><p></p><p>Tongxin and Lin Dong felt this pressure and were also startled. They quickly looked up and exclaimed joyfully, "Master!"</p><p></p><p>Gu Helin looked at the two with satisfaction, then suddenly increased the pressure of the embryonic spirit.</p><p></p><p>The demonic beasts targeted by the embryonic spirit pressure suddenly exploded.</p><p></p><p>This scene left the townspeople dumbfounded, and then they were filled with tears of joy. They had been saved.</p><p></p><p>The vast majority of the people looked towards Gu Helin on the town wall with awe in their eyes.</p><p></p><p>"The immortal has arrived, I knew it, the immortal has not abandoned us."</p><p></p><p>"Yes, the immortal has never abandoned us, the immortal is too powerful."</p><p></p><p>"......"</p><p></p><p>But there were also some whispering voices:</p><p></p><p>"So many people died before he came, I don't understand why he didn't come earlier..."</p><p></p><p>"If I were an immortal, I would guard everyone at all times."</p><p></p><p>"......"</p><p></p><p>These voices, though extremely light, did not escape the divine sense of Gu Helin in his embryonic spirit realm.</p><p></p><p>Gu Helin's face had a smile earlier, but after hearing these, he stiffened for a moment.</p><p></p><p>Before he could ponder further, Tongxin shouted urgently, "Master, those demonic beasts are coming!"</p><p></p><p>Rumble...</p><p></p><p>The trembling of the ground became more and more obvious, gradually becoming like an earthquake, accompanied by countless chilling beast roars!</p><p></p><p>This again frightened the townspeople, who knelt down and begged Gu Helin to save them.</p><p></p><p>Even the townspeople who had just made those casual remarks also knelt down and pleaded, completely different from their previous attitude.</p><p></p><p>Gu Helin suddenly turned around and stared at the massive group of demonic beasts.</p><p></p><p>Soon, his face became deeply grave!</p><p></p><p>These demonic beasts were different from the previous ones. The lowest level of these demonic beasts were second-grade, and among them were even fifth-grade and sixth-grade ones!</p><p></p><p>In other words, the weakest ones were on par with the initial stage of Foundation Establishment, and there were even some on par with the initial or middle stage of Gold Core!</p><p></p><p>The most terrifying thing was that the white-robed man leading them was a demonic cultivator on par with the Embryonic Spirit realm!</p><p></p><p>"M-master..."</p><p></p><p>On the town wall, Tongxin and Lin Dong's voices were a little trembling, and their legs were starting to shake.</p><p></p><p>As for Chen Dadao and the other ordinary people, they had never seen such a scene before. They were terrified and collapsed to the ground, their faces deathly pale.</p><p></p><p>New 69 Book Bar 89s</p><p></p><p>Here is the full English translation of the Chinese excerpt:</p><p></p><p>The garrison soldiers were also terrified, their pants soaked in fear...</p><p></p><p>"Haha, it seems the Demon Realm really can't do anything... They've already been wiped out even before the battle began."</p><p></p><p>The white-robed giant hovered in the air, sweeping his gaze across the town, mocking them.</p><p></p><p>From underground, the unformed demonic beasts echoed in agreement,</p><p></p><p>"Hahaha, the Dragon Bear Demon General is absolutely right! Those lowly scum from the Demon Realm can't accomplish anything. Brothers, isn't that right?"</p><p></p><p>The demonic beasts: "Yes!!!"</p><p></p><p>Seeing this, the white-robed giant threw his head back and laughed maniacally. He was the Great Earth Dragon Bear, sent by the Fierce Demon King at the behest of the Venomous Serpent!</p><p></p><p>At this moment, Gu Helin's eyes were fixed solely on the Great Earth Dragon Bear. The more he looked, the more his expression darkened, and his heart began to tremble.</p><p></p><p>A Demonic Cultivator at the level of a late-stage Nascent Soul! </p><p></p><p>The previous Skywolf and Porcupine were only Eighth-Rank Demonic Cultivators, but this time...</p><p></p><p>Gu Helin frowned and tentatively asked, "So Tenth-Rank Demonic Cultivators have appeared. Are you demons planning to wage war against our Spiritual Dust Realm? Or has it already begun?"</p><p></p><p>The Great Earth Dragon Bear, acting as if he had just noticed Gu Helin, exclaimed in surprise,</p><p></p><p>"Oh, the Venerable True Man of the Qingyan Sect? You've already advanced to the Nascent Soul stage! Congratulations, congratulations! Why aren't you obediently refining elixirs in the sect? Coming out to the secular world, aren't you afraid of losing your life?"</p><p></p><p>Towards the end, the Great Earth Dragon Bear burst into loud laughter, and anyone could hear the mocking tone in his words.</p><p></p><p>Gu Helin's expression was gloomy as he asked, "I ask you, are you going to wage war?"</p><p></p><p>The Great Earth Dragon Bear's eyes shifted, remembering what the Fierce Demon King had told him, and he nodded, saying, "Correct, your Spiritual Dust Realm is about to be in dire straits."</p><p></p><p>After saying this, without waiting for Gu Helin to say anything, he suddenly waved his massive hand!</p><p></p><p>"Crush this little town, leave no living being!"</p><p></p><p>"Yes!!!" The demonic beasts bared their fangs and claws.</p><p></p><p>Gu Helin's heart grew cold at the sight, and he gritted his teeth, shouting,</p><p></p><p>"Tong Xinlin, take Chen Zhenzhuan and the others down!"</p><p></p><p>"Master... what about you?" Tong Xinlin asked anxiously after responding.</p><p></p><p>Gu Helin glanced up at the sky and then roared, "I don't know, just go down quickly!"</p><p></p><p>"Master, be careful."</p><p></p><p>Tong Xinlin then led Lin Cong to take Chen Dajian and the others towards the town wall.</p><p></p><p>Boom, boom, boom!</p><p></p><p>The horde of demonic beasts surged forth, covering the sky and the earth, both on the ground and in the air, a complete onslaught!</p><p></p><p>Compared to the tiny figure of Gu Helin on the town wall, it was like an ant trying to shake a tree.</p><p></p><p>This caused the townspeople to be in a state of panic, terrified and at a loss.</p><p></p><p>"Haha, Venerable Gu, you're really something! Do you think standing in front like this makes you great? Do you think these ants will be grateful to you?"</p><p></p><p>"Wrong! They will only curse you in their hearts, saying you're useless, hehe!"</p><p></p><p>The Great Earth Dragon Bear crossed his arms and continued, "How about joining our Demon Realm? With your exceptional elixir refinement skills, the Demon Lords would surely welcome you."</p><p></p><p>Gu Helin's eyes flickered, and he sternly replied, "I don't care how some of them think. Since this place is under the jurisdiction of my Qingyan Sect, I will give it my all and have no regrets!"</p><p></p><p>Down below, Lin Cong looked at Gu Helin's back with shining eyes, this was the reason he had chosen to become Gu Helin's disciple eight years ago.</p><p></p><p>"Hmph, what a useless good-for-nothing!" The Great Earth Dragon Bear's expression turned gloomy, and he shouted fiercely, "Tear him apart!"</p><p></p><p>At the same time, in the sky above.</p><p></p><p>"Master, Gu Helin can temporarily hold off this group of demonic beasts, but if that Demonic Cultivator attacks, he won't be able to withstand even one move."</p><p></p><p>The old turtle looked at the fierce battle below, speaking to Luchang Sheng.</p><p></p><p>"So that Demonic Cultivator hasn't made a move yet, huh?" Luchang Sheng glanced at the old turtle, saying.</p><p></p><p>The old turtle coughed dryly, trying to cover his embarrassment.</p><p></p><p>Luchang Sheng softly said, "Now that he has just advanced to the Nascent Soul stage, letting him stabilize his realm quickly isn't a bad thing."</p><p></p><p>The old turtle paused, that made sense...</p><p></p><p>Luchang Sheng clasped his hands behind his back and looked down, murmuring,</p><p></p><p>"Actually, I'm a bit curious, once he experiences human nature, will his heart change."</p>

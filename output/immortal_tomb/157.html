        <h1>Chapter 157</h1>
        <div class="content">
            <p>Here is the full English translation of the Chinese excerpt:</p><p></p><p>The sight of the four major factions finally emerging caused an uproar among the crowd outside the tavern. üçßüíã‚ûÖ‚ûàÔΩìÂçÑ‚ìäùîÅ.·∂ú‚ìûÔº≠üê†üêØ</p><p></p><p>They had been drinking for so long, and their hearts were filled with discontent, but they dared not express it.</p><p></p><p>At this moment,</p><p></p><p>Lord Zuo Qiu-shan secretly gritted his teeth and suddenly knelt down in front of the courtyard wall.</p><p></p><p>This sudden kneeling caused the expressions on the faces of the many cultivators to instantly freeze.</p><p></p><p>The lord of the Heavenly Snake Manor... what is he doing......</p><p></p><p>As if realizing something, the cultivators abruptly looked towards the tavern, their hearts surging with shock!</p><p></p><p>"Lord Zuo, then we shall take our leave first."</p><p></p><p>The leaders of the three major factions - Zhao Wu-you and the others - paused for a moment, bid their farewells, and quickly left with their own young masters.</p><p></p><p>The area became increasingly quiet, and even the next batch of cultivators scheduled to enter the tavern hesitated and stood dumbly.</p><p></p><p>However, Peng Fang's eyes flickered, and he couldn't help but glance towards the tavern, recalling the young manager in green robes, murmuring to himself: "The Black Abyss Domain truly harbors hidden dragons and crouching tigers, for even a tavern manager to be so accomplished..."</p><p></p><p>"The Soul-Cleansing Wine is limited to 200 jars per day, and each person is only allowed one jar per day. Those customers who haven't been called, please leave early and come back tomorrow morning!"</p><p></p><p>The clear voice of Tong Xin resounded among the crowd.</p><p></p><p>Hearing this, the people were stunned, especially those at the back of the line, who were dumbfounded.</p><p></p><p>This meant they would have to wait until the year of the monkey to get their turn! Could it be that they would have to wait just to try the Soul-Cleansing Wine?</p><p></p><p>"Ah, I won't wait anymore, I'll come back another day and try my luck."</p><p></p><p>"I'll go find some flowers and willows instead. Whether I can drink the Soul-Cleansing Wine is ultimately a matter of fate."</p><p></p><p>"Little brother, you can't just let everyone wait in vain. How about this, you can register the customers in line in order, so at least everyone can have a chance to drink it, and it'll be more fair."</p><p></p><p>"Yes, that's a good idea!"</p><p></p><p>"Great suggestion!"</p><p></p><p>"......"</p><p></p><p>This proposal rekindled hope in the hearts of the crowd!</p><p></p><p>Tong Xin looked at Lin Dong and said, "Little brother, then you can handle the registration."</p><p></p><p>"Okay, elder brother," Lin Dong responded, taking out a ledger and heading towards the line to start registering the customers.</p><p></p><p>Meanwhile, Tong Xin led the group of twenty cultivators into the tavern.</p><p></p><p>.........</p><p></p><p>Lord Zuo Qiu-shan knelt on the ground, facing the courtyard wall, his eyes closed as he spoke softly, "Youer, Qi-ran, you two should return to the manor."</p><p></p><p>Thud.</p><p></p><p>Unexpectedly, Zuo Qi-ran knelt down behind him, remaining silent.</p><p></p><p>The originally hesitant Zuo You's expression changed slightly, and he quickly knelt down, pleading earnestly, "Adoptive father, Youer will stay and keep you company."</p><p></p><p>But his actions were still a step slower than Zuo Qi-ran's.</p><p></p><p>This scene was registered in Zuo Qiu-shan's awareness, and his heart was stirred. After a moment, he said, "Youer, since you are now the young master of the Heavenly Snake Manor, you should return to the manor and cooperate with the Grand Elder in managing the affairs. Meanwhile, make sure they don't act rashly. As for me, I'm afraid I'll have to stay at the Longevity Tavern of my predecessor for the next three years."</p><p></p><p>Zuo You's eyes flickered, and he spoke sincerely, "Adoptive father, the Grand Elder and the others in the manor are sufficient. Youer still wishes to stay and keep you company."</p><p></p><p>Zuo Qiu-shan replied indifferently, "No need for further discussion, go back."</p><p></p><p>Zuo You inwardly rejoiced, but his expression was bittersweet as he slowly stood up and gave a salute, "Adoptive father, then Youer shall return to the manor."</p><p></p><p>Seeing Zuo Qiu-shan nod, Zuo You bowed and retreated, disappearing into the crowd in no time.</p><p></p><p>At this moment, Zuo Qiu-shan suddenly chuckled lightly, "Adopted son... after all, he is only an adopted son."</p><p></p><p>Zuo Qi-ran lowered her head, still silent.</p><p></p><p>"Qi-ran, you should go back as well," Zuo Qiu-shan said softly, feeling the strange gazes of the crowd on his back.</p><p></p><p>Zuo Qi-ran raised her head and looked at his back, asking in a firm voice, "Lord, is it that a daughter cannot shoulder the banner of the Heavenly Snake Manor?"</p><p></p><p>She had never understood this.</p><p></p><p>Here is the full English translation of the Chinese excerpt:</p><p></p><p>Why must the position of the Young Master of the Tian She Manor be given to an adopted son with no blood relation!</p><p></p><p>Zuo Chou Shan's eyes trembled slightly as he softly said, "Do you know how your mother died?"</p><p></p><p>Upon hearing this, Zuo Qi Ran was startled, and hastily said, "Didn't you say before that my mother was killed by an evil person? Why are you saying this now?"</p><p></p><p>"Hehe."</p><p></p><p>Zuo Chou Shan was conflicted for a moment, then his eyes hardened as he coldly laughed, "It's true that she was killed by an evil person, but what if that evil person was your maternal grandfather and grandmother?"</p><p></p><p>Maternal grandfather and grandmother...? </p><p></p><p>Zuo Qi Ran was dumbfounded. When did she ever have a maternal grandfather and grandmother?</p><p></p><p>Seeing this, Zuo Chou Shan closed his eyes and a warm smile appeared on his face as he slowly said, "In the past, I had the fortune of encountering your mother, and was lucky enough to gain her favor. We loved each other for thirty thousand years. At the time, I was just a humble cultivator who had just entered the realm of Xian Jun, without any background to speak of. But your mother was the noble daughter of the Imperial Clan..."</p><p></p><p>As he said this, a look of inferiority flashed across Zuo Chou Shan's face. </p><p></p><p>Zuo Qi Ran's expression was dazed. This was the first time Zuo Chou Shan had ever told her these things. In the past, their father-daughter relationship had been very poor, and she didn't even know her mother's name.</p><p></p><p>She never imagined that her mother, whom she had never met, was actually the daughter of the Imperial Clan!</p><p></p><p>"As for what happened afterwards, the whole process was quite clich√©d. I'm sure you can guess it," Zuo Chou Shan said with a slight tilt of his head.</p><p></p><p>Zuo Qi Ran nodded. She knew that given her father's strength and background at the time, he would have faced great difficulties and obstacles in being with a daughter of the Imperial Clan.</p><p></p><p>But still...</p><p></p><p>"You just want to know how your mother died, right?" Zuo Chou Shan asked rhetorically, then let out a bitter laugh. "Your maternal grandfather, grandmother, and all the clan elders were against me and your mother being together. I clearly remember that in the clan, all kinds of insults and ridicule poured down on me, and they even threatened to kill me, that ignorant beast!"</p><p></p><p>As he said this, Zuo Chou Shan's smile faded, and his eyes had turned bloodshot. He continued trembling, "I wanted to leave that place of strife so as not to implicate your mother, but she kept a close watch on me and wouldn't let me leave. She staunchly defended me, but it was precisely her defense that ultimately enraged your maternal grandfather and grandmother. In their fury, they simultaneously unleashed their divine powers against me!"</p><p></p><p>"The methods of the Immortal Emperor were something a mere Xuan Jun cultivator like me could not withstand. At that time, death was just a step away from me."</p><p></p><p>"No one expected that your mother would suddenly block me, facing that ruthless killing intent head-on... Your maternal grandfather and grandmother were horrified at the sight, and tried to pull back their attacks, but it was too late. Your mother sacrificed herself to save me..."</p><p></p><p>Zuo Qi Ran was silent for a moment, then asked, "So how did you survive afterwards?"</p><p></p><p>"As your mother was dying, she revealed a shocking secret she had been desperately hiding - she was pregnant with my child, a dragon-phoenix twin. Your brother is now in the Imperial Clan."</p><p></p><p>"It was only then that your maternal grandfather and grandmother spared me, but they also banished me from the Imperial Clan. Later, when you were born, your brother's bloodline was purer, so he was naturally kept in the clan. But your bloodline was more impure, and you were a daughter, so your maternal grandfather and grandmother cast you off to me."</p><p></p><p>"I immediately took you and fled the Imperial Clan, but they still secretly sent Immortal Kings after me, trying to kill me! I carried you, wandering and barely escaping with my life, until I finally reached this chaotic Black Sha Domain. Even to this day, the Imperial Clan still sends people into this Black Sha Domain, trying to find my whereabouts. Hehe, little do they know that I've already changed my appearance, but the risk of being discovered still remains..."</p><p></p><p>Zuo Chou Shan's expression turned ferocious as he said indifferently, "Your father has been secretly developing in the Black Sha Domain. But to avenge your mother, I'm still not at the level of an Immortal Emperor, and it's uncertain when I'll be able to do so."</p><p></p><p>Zuo Qi Ran stood there, stunned.</p>

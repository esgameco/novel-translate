        <h1>Chapter 502</h1>
        <div class="content">
            <p>Here is the full English translation of the excerpt from the Chinese novel:</p><p></p><p>Lu Changsheng seemed unperturbed, only exerting a slight force with his feet.</p><p></p><p>Crack!</p><p></p><p>Chu You's skull instantly shattered into pieces, and if Lu Changsheng applied just a little more force, Chu You's head would explode!</p><p></p><p>Chu You directly felt an excruciating pain in his brain, and he wanted to scream out loud, but he tightly suppressed himself, not daring to make a sound!</p><p></p><p>He was afraid that if he exerted any strength, his skull would shatter even without Lu Changsheng stepping on it!</p><p></p><p>Chu You finally quieted down, but he endured the unbearable pain, his eyes staring fixatedly at the scene!</p><p></p><p>As long as the Patriarch could win!</p><p></p><p>As long as the Patriarch could win, even if he, Chu You, perished, that Lu Changsheng would have to be buried with him!!</p><p></p><p>It was worth it!</p><p></p><p>Beside him, the old turtle was shocked, watching the scene of the Patriarch of the Chu Clan.</p><p></p><p>Although he had grasped three supreme laws, they were only recently comprehended and were still in the cultivation stage.</p><p></p><p>Compared to one who had mastered the Law of Light to the pinnacle, he was still somewhat inferior in the short term.</p><p></p><p>...</p><p></p><p>The territory of the Chu Clan seemed to have transformed into a world of light.</p><p></p><p>The towering giant hand suddenly accelerated its speed and pressed down ruthlessly!</p><p></p><p>In response, the disciples of the Chu Clan were not the least bit flustered, focusing all their attention on their Patriarch, eagerly anticipating his grand display of might!</p><p></p><p>At this moment, the white light blood in the Patriarch of the Chu Clan's body was flowing at an extreme speed, and his light bones were creaking loudly.</p><p></p><p>The radiance in the heavens and earth seemed to have gained consciousness, frantically gathering in front of him, causing the space to become distorted!</p><p></p><p>The next moment, he raised both hands and pushed upwards with a fierce roar:</p><p></p><p>"The light of the world is mine to command, Arcane Art, Great Drying Extreme Light Palm!!"</p><p></p><p>Countless rays of light quickly merged into two equally massive light palms, striking towards the giant hand above!</p><p></p><p>As the two light palms shot forth, they continued to grow in size, quickly surpassing the size of Lu Changsheng's giant hand!</p><p></p><p>At least visually, the Patriarch of the Chu Clan's move seemed to have the upper hand!</p><p></p><p>"The Patriarch is invincible!!"</p><p></p><p>In the territory of the Chu Clan, countless disciples erupted in excited cheers.</p><p></p><p>Even in the Elven Clan's venue, the Chu Clan members were watching with pounding hearts and rapid breathing.</p><p></p><p>Just then, the two light palms struck the giant hand!</p><p></p><p>Boom!!</p><p></p><p>The entire continent shook even more violently, and towering waves came rushing in from the distance, each one higher than the last, reaching thousands of meters high, an absolute tsunami capable of annihilating all life.</p><p></p><p>But at this moment, no one paid attention to that, all of them covering their ears and staring dumbfoundedly at the Chu Clan's side.</p><p></p><p>Only to see that the light palms had struck the giant hand, but they instantly dissipated!</p><p></p><p>They couldn't even block the hand's instantaneous movement!</p><p></p><p>How was this possible?</p><p></p><p>Everyone refused to believe what they were seeing, their hearts exclaiming that it was impossible!</p><p></p><p>The countless disciples of the Chu Clan, as well as those in the Elven Clan's venue, fell into a deathly silence, unable to believe the sight before their eyes.</p><p></p><p>At this time, the Patriarch of the Chu Clan regained his senses, his expression now filled with unprecedented gravity.</p><p></p><p>He gritted his teeth and forcefully drew all the light energies back into his body.</p><p></p><p>His light body rapidly grew in size, becoming larger and larger, until it transformed into a light giant tens of thousands of meters tall, towering over the world like a primordial being.</p><p></p><p>"This Patriarch refuses to believe that you can withstand this!"</p><p></p><p>The Patriarch of the Chu Clan roared, and his tens of thousands of meter tall light body trembled, then shot towards the giant hand at a terrifying speed.</p><p></p><p>"Arcane Art! Indestructible Light Body!!"</p><p></p><p>"Die for me!!"</p><p></p><p>In less than a breath, the Patriarch of the Chu Clan shot towards the giant hand like a pillar of light, under the gaze of countless onlookers.</p><p></p><p>Boomâ€”</p><p></p><p>A thunderous roar that shook heaven and earth!</p><p></p><p>"Impossible!"</p><p></p><p>This anguished cry came from the Patriarch of the Chu Clan.</p><p></p><p>For the giant hand before him remained completely unharmed!</p><p></p><p>The Patriarch of the Chu Clan was seized by terror, and he wanted to flee as light.</p><p></p><p>But at that moment, the giant hand that had been spread wide suddenly clenched shut!!</p><p></p><p>The speed that the Patriarch of the Chu Clan took pride in was utterly useless at this time, and he was instantly grasped by the giant hand, like a mere toy!</p><p></p><p>"No! No! No!! Venerable one, how have we of the Chu Clan offended you?!!"</p><p></p><p>The Patriarch of the Chu Clan cried out in anguish as he felt the giant hand slowly tightening.</p><p></p><p>At this time, whether it was the countless disciples of the Chu Clan or those in the Elven Clan's venue, they had all lost their souls, numb to the core as they watched the scene unfold.</p><p></p><p>Here is the full English translation of the Chinese excerpt:</p><p></p><p>Look at this scene!</p><p></p><p>The Holy Light Venerable has exhausted all his means, yet he is unable to shake it even slightly...</p><p></p><p>Is that giant hand truly undefeatable?</p><p></p><p>Then, who is the azure-robed man who casually slapped it out?</p><p></p><p>In the next moment, the giant hand suddenly clenched!</p><p></p><p>Crack!!</p><p></p><p>Accompanied by a chilling scream, the Holy Light Venerable's luminous body instantly shattered into pieces!</p><p></p><p>His entire skeletal structure, blood vessels, and organs were instantly reduced to powder and photons!</p><p></p><p>The extremely dense light laws were fed back into the Three Thousand Realms,</p><p></p><p>And the numerous light anomalies in the Three Thousand Realms instantly vanished without a trace!</p><p></p><p>A generation of Holy Light Venerable has thus perished!</p><p></p><p>Without waiting for the crowd to regain their senses, the giant hand suddenly opened and continued to strike downwards towards the Chu Clan!</p><p></p><p>"No, no!!"</p><p></p><p>Countless Chu Clan disciples instantly broke through the defenses, letting out agonizing screams!</p><p></p><p>With the Venerable dead, the so-called protective clan formation could no longer provide them with any sense of security!!</p><p></p><p>"Crack, crack, crack, boom!"</p><p></p><p>As expected, the protective clan formation instantly collapsed, and the giant hand ruthlessly crushed the Chu Clan's vast domain!!</p><p></p><p>"Boom!!"</p><p></p><p>This continent suddenly shook even more violently, and the space was on the verge of shattering!!</p><p></p><p>At this time, no one had noticed that a towering tidal wave tens of thousands of feet high was rushing in from the distance, blocking out the sun!</p><p></p><p>In the Chu Clan's domain, the giant hand dissipated like particles.</p><p></p><p>What was left was a hundred-million-li gaping hole, at the bottom of which was the turbulent sea of laws.</p><p></p><p>Lu Changsheng's palm strike had pierced through this continent!</p><p></p><p>And the Chu Clan, naturally, left no trace.</p><p></p><p>The crowd watching the scene felt as if they were dreaming!</p><p></p><p>To forcibly pierce through the continent above the Sea of Laws, this was their first time witnessing such a feat!</p><p></p><p>...</p><p></p><p>In the Elf Clan's venue.</p><p></p><p>Deathly silent.</p><p></p><p>The scene on the screen deeply unsettled everyone's nerves!</p><p></p><p>Endless terror arose in their hearts!</p><p></p><p>Too powerful, far beyond their imagination!</p><p></p><p>They couldn't help but recall the arrogant words of the azure-robed man's servant when he first arrived at the venue.</p><p></p><p>Could the azure-robed man really have the ability to crush their Three Thousand Realms?</p><p></p><p>From what they just witnessed, it seemed that it was not so unbelievable.</p><p></p><p>Qing and Lin were kneeling there, trembling uncontrollably!!</p><p></p><p>Azure-robed Lord, what kind of existence is he exactly?!</p><p></p><p>The Chu Clan members stood there dumbfounded, utterly dejected.</p><p></p><p>Chu Yu's pupils shrank to pinpoints, with an ocean of hatred surging within.</p><p></p><p>But faced with such absolute power, Chu Yu sadly realized that he was powerless.</p><p></p><p>"This is what you have brought upon yourself. Does it look good?" </p><p></p><p>At this moment, Lu Changsheng, standing on Chu Yu's head, looked down at Chu Yu and chuckled lightly.</p><p></p><p>That smile made everyone present shudder with cold fear!</p><p></p><p>Chu Yu's expression was like that of a vengeful ghost, but he bit his lip tightly, daring not to utter a single word.</p><p></p><p>"Boom!"</p><p></p><p>Suddenly, a muffled explosion in the venue startled everyone.</p><p></p><p>They watched in horror as the Chu Clan elders who had been kneeling there disappeared without a trace - the slowly drifting blood mist was the only proof that they had once existed in this world.</p><p></p><p>"Wuu, wuu, wuuu... I, Chu Yu, am the clan's sinner."</p><p></p><p>Chu Yu was stunned for a moment before breaking down, crying uncontrollably, completely forgetting the agonizing pain of his severed head.</p><p></p><p>Chu Yu trembled and hoarsely said, "You killed me... kill me!"</p><p></p><p>Lu Changsheng suppressed his smile, and a hint of pity seemed to flash in his eyes:</p><p></p><p>"Your family is already destroyed, so I suddenly don't want to kill you anymore. How about I let you go?"</p><p></p><p>Chu Yu trembled, his eyes flickering with a mixture of desperate collapse and malice, and he stammered:</p><p></p><p>"Good... good! Thank you, Lord, for your mercy. Please leave the Chu Clan with a thread of life. I, Chu Yu, will absolutely..."</p><p></p><p>Boom.</p><p></p><p>Before Chu Yu could finish speaking, Lu Changsheng simply crushed his head into powder with a kick.</p><p></p><p>"Fool, I was just joking with you."</p>

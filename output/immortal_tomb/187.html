        <h1>Chapter 187</h1>
        <div class="content">
            <p>Here is my translation of the Chinese excerpt:</p><p></p><p>Soon, Su Qianghe and the others also hurried over when they heard the news. </p><p></p><p>When they saw Lu Changsheng, they were all startled, knowing that since the manager had returned, it meant the Battle Clan Dynasty might have... </p><p></p><p>They took a deep breath, then looked puzzled at the surging crowd, and after inquiring, they learned what had happened.</p><p></p><p>Su Qianghe's face flushed with excitement, momentarily forgetting about the Battle Clan Dynasty, and joined the crowd in cheering and shouting.</p><p></p><p>Even some usually taciturn cultivators were infected, their faces breaking into smiles. </p><p></p><p>Where in the Black Demon Domain could there be such a joyful atmosphere? Only here in Qingxuan Town.</p><p></p><p>At first, Lu Changsheng was smiling, but after a while, he rubbed his brow and waved his hand wearily, saying, "Alright, alright, everyone be quiet, all of you leave now, come back tomorrow."</p><p></p><p>With that, he went into the courtyard, escorted by the vigilant Peng Fang and Left Chou Shan.</p><p></p><p>After Lu Changsheng spoke, the place fell silent, and no one dared make a sound. </p><p></p><p>But the next moment, they charged forward in silence, their eyes flickering!</p><p></p><p>What were they doing?</p><p></p><p>Of course, lining up! First come, first served!</p><p></p><p>Left Chou Shan heard the commotion and hurried out of the courtyard, shouting loudly, "All of you, line up properly! No chaos! I'll see who dares to cause trouble at the Longevity Tavern!!"</p><p></p><p>As he spoke, a powerful Immortal Venerable aura swept out, instantly making the crowd obedient.</p><p></p><p>Among them were quite a few Immortal Venerables, and even some hidden Immortal Emperor level figures, all drawn by the name. Now Qingxuan Town was truly a place where tigers and dragons lurked.</p><p></p><p>Some Immortal Emperor realm experts looked disdainfully at Left Chou Shan, inwardly cursing: This little Immortal Venerable, relying on the manager's backing, acting arrogantly - I spit on him!</p><p></p><p>Of course, they didn't dare express this openly, and instead all smiled amiably at Left Chou Shan.</p><p></p><p>Left Chou Shan saw this and was secretly delighted.</p><p></p><p>What are Immortal Emperors? They still have to behave obediently!</p><p></p><p>Normally, these Immortal Emperors would definitely look down on him as a mere Immortal Venerable, </p><p></p><p>but times have changed, and he is now the sole gatekeeper of the Longevity Tavern!!</p><p></p><p>No, he must find a way to continue being the gatekeeper, three years is too short, if possible, he hopes to do it for a lifetime.</p><p></p><p>Here is the full English translation of the Chinese novel excerpt:</p><p></p><p>The hearts of Tongxin and Lin Dong had become numb, it had been a full ten days already......</p><p></p><p>Fortunately, these were the last two jars.</p><p></p><p>When the last two jars of Manqun were emptied to the bottom, the two of them heaved a big sigh of relief, and directly told the countless cultivators still waiting in line, "It's all gone."</p><p></p><p>These cultivators were immediately disheartened, lamenting that they had missed this rare and precious opportunity.</p><p></p><p>In fact, during these ten days, most of the people in Qingxuan Town had already received their free share of Manqun,</p><p></p><p>Those who didn't get any were from other places who had rushed over upon hearing the news.</p><p></p><p>.........</p><p></p><p>As night fell, the night sky was dotted with stars.</p><p></p><p>With a creak, Tongxin pushed open the courtyard door, sticking out his head and smiling at the bewildered Left Choushan, "Uncle Left, the boss asked you to go call over Uncle Peng Fang, Uncle Su Qianghe, Uncle Wu You, and Uncle Jiu Kui."</p><p></p><p>Left Choushan's eyes were filled with doubt, not knowing what the boss meant by this, as this was the first time.</p><p>However, he didn't dare to be negligent, and quickly responded with a smile.</p><p></p><p>Tongxin chuckled, then withdrew his head back inside.</p><p></p><p>After the time it takes to drink a cup of tea,</p><p></p><p>In the tavern.</p><p></p><p>The candles flickered.</p><p></p><p>Peng Fang, Left Choushan, Su Qianghe, Zhao Wu You, Yin Jiukui, Lin Dong, and Tongxin stood there respectfully.</p><p></p><p>Lu Changsheng was quietly rocking back and forth in the rocking chair.</p><p></p><p>At this moment,</p><p>Peng Fang and the others were anxious, even Tongxin and Lin Dong were a bit nervous, their palms sweating.</p><p></p><p>No one knew what Lu Changsheng meant by this.</p><p></p><p>Suddenly, Lu Changsheng opened his eyes and looked at them with a smile, "The tavern is about to close."</p><p></p><p>Immediately, Peng Fang and the others' hearts sank, and they abruptly looked up, gazing at Lu Changsheng with difficulty.</p><p></p><p>No wonder the free Manqun had been distributed for a full ten days... It turns out this was the reason...</p><p></p><p>After the incidents involving the Jiang Imperial Clan and the Zhan Imperial Clan, they had already anticipated in their hearts that the boss had opened this tavern with a purpose, and might leave in the future, but they never imagined that this day would come so soon.</p><p></p><p>Left Choushan was also very distressed, because the gatekeeper had not done his job properly.</p><p></p><p>Su Qianghe's eyes were also reddening, he really wanted to say, "Boss, without your wine to drink, how will old Su survive?"</p><p></p><p>Seeing Su Qianghe's terrified expression, Lu Changsheng raised his eyebrows slightly and waved his hand with a smile, "These are all minor matters. The reason I called you here tonight is that I have something I want to ask you about."</p><p></p><p>The group hurriedly bowed, "Boss, please speak freely, we will definitely comply!"</p><p></p><p>Lu Changsheng smiled slightly, standing up from the rocking chair and walking in front of them, saying directly, "I'm going to establish a sect on the other side of the Heavenly Scar, and the various positions in the sect are currently lacking people. You..."</p><p></p><p>Lu Changsheng's words were not even finished yet,</p><p>when the group's eyes suddenly burst forth with unbelievable brilliance. They quickly responded, "Boss, of course we are willing! Extremely willing!"</p><p></p><p>Such a rare and precious opportunity, how could they not be willing!</p><p></p><p>And... to go beyond the Heavenly Scar!</p><p>They had been dreaming of going beyond the Heavenly Scar to take a look!</p><p></p><p>Unfortunately, to go beyond the Heavenly Scar, the rumor was that one had to pass through the Extremely Gloomy Forest, and the Extremely Gloomy Forest was the domain of the Ancestor Beasts... For them, it was too difficult.</p><p></p><p>Lu Changsheng was not at all surprised by their reaction. He smiled and said, "Alright then, you all go back and prepare. Bring your elite disciples, and gather outside Qingxuan Town in an hour."</p><p></p><p>The group was momentarily stunned, not expecting it to be so fast, but they quickly nodded their heads, paid their respects, and left excitedly.</p><p></p><p>For people like them from the Black Abyss Domain, it didn't matter where they were, they basically had no roots, and being able to follow the incredibly powerful boss to go beyond the Heavenly Scar, and in the future have the chance to drink the boss's wine... This was simply amazing.</p><p></p><p>Peng Fang, who remained standing, suddenly bowed to Lu Changsheng with a smile, "Sect Master, I won't be dragging my family along like those young fellows."</p><p></p><p>Tongxin and Lin Dong regained their senses and couldn't help but chuckle. Peng Uncle was still the same old Peng Uncle... He had directly changed the way he addressed the master.</p><p></p><p>Well, they couldn't keep calling him "master" either. In fact, they should have been addressing him as "boss" all along... From now on, they would have to call him "Sect Master".</p><p></p><p>Lu Changsheng chuckled, then clasped his hands behind his back and walked out, saying, "Then let's go wait for them outside the town."</p><p></p><p>"Yes, Sect Master."</p><p></p><p>Peng Fang and the others immediately followed.</p><p></p><p>The moment the three of them stepped out of the courtyard, they felt a slight tremor in their hearts, and in unison turned back to look... Only to find that the old Changsheng Tavern had disappeared...</p><p></p><p>The three of them stood in silence for a moment, feeling a sense of emptiness in their hearts, then quickly turned around and hurried after the figure in black.</p><p></p><p>In the darkness, Peng Fang's respectful voice rang out, "Sect Master, what shall we name our sect?"</p><p></p><p>Lu Changsheng smiled and said,</p><p>"Xiaoyao."</p>

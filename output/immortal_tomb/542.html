        <h1>Chapter 542</h1>
        <div class="content">
            <p>Here is the full English translation of the Chinese excerpt:</p><p></p><p>After a simple lunch, the three of them - Han Yue, Lü Changsheng, and the others - paid their respects to Lü Changsheng and quickly returned to Changsheng Academy.</p><p></p><p>With nothing to do, Lü Changsheng went to Qiuqing Pavilion to listen to some music.</p><p></p><p>Coincidentally, he encountered Huang Yulang again.</p><p></p><p>Although Huang Yulang was still respectful towards Lü Changsheng, he could not hide his embarrassment and awkwardness.</p><p></p><p>"Mr. Lü... about Xuan..."</p><p></p><p>Huang Yulang began bitterly.</p><p></p><p>Lü Changsheng smiled and said, "No worries, as people strive to reach higher, water flows to the lower ground, this is only natural. Moreover, Xuan possesses the Earth Martial Vein, so developing at the Tianwu Sect would be better than staying at our academy, after all, whether he can become a Shu Xiu is another matter."</p><p></p><p>Hearing this, Huang Yulang was moved, but the openness of the gentleman in front of him only made him feel more ashamed. He bowed and said, "Thank you for your understanding, sir."</p><p></p><p>Lü Changsheng waved his hand, "It's nothing, let's just enjoy the music."</p><p></p><p>"Yes."</p><p></p><p>Huang Yulang quickly responded and sat down to accompany Lü Changsheng, drinking wine and listening to the music, though he sighed inwardly from time to time.</p><p></p><p>Lü Changsheng swirled the wine in his cup, listening to the music, his gaze curiously fixed on the direction outside the town.</p><p></p><p>...</p><p></p><p>At the same time, outside Jixiang Town, an uninvited group of sixteen people, mostly elders and middle-aged men, had arrived.</p><p></p><p>These people were the senior members of the various sects, apart from Elder Wangsu and Steward Song from the Tianwu Sect.</p><p></p><p>"Hehe, you all arrived quite quickly..." </p><p></p><p>Wangsu looked around, hands behind his back, and chuckled coldly.</p><p></p><p>As an elder of the number one sect in the Star Luo Empire, he now had an aura of a big shot in front of the other sect members.</p><p></p><p>However, Wangsu was not being arrogant, as he was only an outer sect elder of the Tianwu Sect.</p><p></p><p>The other sects had all sent their inner sect elders, which showed how much they valued the Earth Martial Vein.</p><p></p><p>Wangsu did not look down on these people, but he also did not take them too seriously, as he had the backing of the Tianwu Sect.</p><p></p><p>But behind Wangsu, Steward Song's expression became worried!</p><p></p><p>He was concerned that in order to obtain the Earth Martial Vein, these sect elders might not buy the Tianwu Sect's story, and if that happened, it would be disastrous!</p><p></p><p>If the sects found out that Wangsu and he had deliberately concealed the existence of the Earth Martial Vein for their own benefit... not only Steward Song, but even Elder Wangsu would be in trouble.</p><p></p><p>Alas, they had acted too hastily! Now that it had come to this, they could only take it one step at a time and hope the sects would remain rational.</p><p></p><p>"Hehe, so it's Elder Wangsu. We've long heard of the renowned name of Elder Wangsu from the outer sect of the Tianwu Sect, and now that we've met, you truly live up to your reputation."</p><p></p><p>"Elder Wangsu, we've heard that a shocking three Earth Martial Veins have appeared in this small town, but your Tianwu Sect has only brought back one, leaving the other two behind. Could it be that you've intentionally left them for us other sects?"</p><p></p><p>"Haha haha, how generous! No wonder the Tianwu Sect is the number one martial sect in Star Luo Empire!"</p><p></p><p>"Hehe, Elder Lin, the way you put it, it seems the Tianwu Sect has always taken most of the Earth Martial Veins that have appeared in the Star Luo Empire. It looks like this time, the Tianwu Sect is willing to let the other sects have a taste."</p><p></p><p>"..."</p><p></p><p>The various sect elders discussed among themselves, their tones sarcastic and mocking.</p><p></p><p>Normally, they would not dare to speak to the Tianwu Sect in such a way.</p><p></p><p>But this time was different.</p><p></p><p>For the sake of these two Earth Martial Veins, the sects had temporarily formed an alliance.</p><p></p><p>No matter what, they could not let the Tianwu Sect snatch these two Earth Martial Veins away again!</p><p></p><p>At this moment, the sect elders also breathed a sigh of relief.</p><p></p><p>As seasoned elders, they naturally had deep schemes. They could see at a glance that Wangsu had not reported these two Earth Martial Veins to his sect.</p><p></p><p>This Wangsu, he has great ambitions, wanting to make a big contribution, hehe...</p><p></p><p>Otherwise, with the Earth Martial Veins being two in number, the Tianwu Sect would not have just left them behind, would they?</p><p></p><p>Here is the full English translation of the Chinese excerpt:</p><p></p><p>It's impossible that only the outer sect elders were sent here!</p><p></p><p>It doesn't make sense, so the previous possibility must be true!</p><p></p><p>At this moment.</p><p></p><p>Although Wangsao's expression remained unchanged, his heart had gradually sunk.</p><p></p><p>He had been blinded by greed and careless!</p><p></p><p>Wangsao could see that the elders of the various sects had united.</p><p></p><p>Yes, after all, those were two powerful spiritual veins!</p><p></p><p>Song Ren, however, did not have Wangsao's composure, and the words "difficult to look at" were almost written on his face.</p><p></p><p>Wangsao's heartbeat quickened slightly, and he warned in a calm voice:</p><p></p><p>"Gentlemen, the spiritual veins were first discovered by our Tianwu Sect..."</p><p></p><p>The elders of the various sects exchanged glances and smiled:</p><p></p><p>"Elder Wangsao, your words are mistaken. There is no such thing as first discovery or not. The good seedlings with spiritual veins, whoever is destined to obtain them, once they join our respective sects, we will naturally devote ourselves to cultivating them."</p><p></p><p>"Elder Lin is right, and Elder Wangsao, your Tianwu Sect's spiritual veins are actually more than the sum of all our sects' spiritual veins. You have already brought one back, and if you want to bring these two back as well, that wouldn't be appropriate, would it?"</p><p></p><p>"..."</p><p></p><p>"Eh? Where are the people from the Daoyan Sect? The Daoyan Sect is the closest to this Jixiang Town, so they should have arrived by now, right?"</p><p></p><p>Suddenly, an elder reacted and digressed, questioning.</p><p></p><p>The elders of the various sects looked at each other, all puzzled.</p><p></p><p>That's right, where are the people from the Daoyan Sect? Don't they want the spiritual veins?</p><p></p><p>Among the sects, the only one that can match the Tianwu Sect is the Daoyan Sect!</p><p></p><p>If the Daoyan Sect were present, their confidence would be even stronger!</p><p></p><p>Wangsao saw that the elders of the various sects did not take him seriously, and his expression finally could not help but look unpleasant!</p><p></p><p>He simply laid his cards on the table and said in a deep voice:</p><p></p><p>"Gentlemen, are you preparing to be enemies with my Tianwu Sect? You'd better think it through... Your sects may be able to ally for a while, but can you ally forever?"</p><p></p><p>As soon as the words fell, the eyes of the crowd changed!</p><p></p><p>Because Wangsao's words were a blatant threat!</p><p></p><p>"Hehe! Elder Wangsao! Don't say such reckless words, when have we ever said we want to be enemies with the Tianwu Sect? We all revere the Tianwu Sect and see it as a role model. Elder Wangsao, don't say anything that destroys the friendship between the sects again!"</p><p></p><p>An elder immediately said in a firm tone.</p><p></p><p>Wangsao felt disgusted in his heart, frowning deeply, he waved his sleeve and no longer wanted to speak, at the same time signaling Songren with the corner of his eye!</p><p></p><p>Songren immediately understood, knowing that Wangsao was letting him send a message to the sect later to call for reinforcements!</p><p></p><p>At this time, under the gaze of everyone, it was naturally not good to make a move.</p><p></p><p>"Hmph, this elder does not wish to say more, each one relies on their own abilities!"</p><p></p><p>With that, Wangsao waved his sleeve and headed towards Jixiang Town.</p><p></p><p>Songren remained in place, his eyes flickering, waiting for everyone to go in, then he would immediately send a message to the sect!</p><p></p><p>"Eh? Isn't this Tianwu Sect's steward going in together?"</p><p></p><p>At this time, an elder looked at Songren and cupped his hands, smiling.</p><p></p><p>The others also turned their gaze to Songren, staring at him intently!</p><p></p><p>Songren was suddenly drenched in sweat, realizing that it was impossible to send a message now!</p><p></p><p>They are all old foxes!</p><p></p><p>"Songren, why are you still standing there spacing out? Follow this elder into the town!"</p><p></p><p>Wangsao's low shout came to the rescue, and he also knew that with these old guys watching him closely, it would be difficult to send a message later.</p><p></p><p>The elders of the various sects saw this and smiled knowingly, then their expressions became solemn as they headed towards the town.</p><p></p><p>They dared not be careless, as competing with the Tianwu Sect for the spiritual veins was extremely risky.</p><p></p><p>"Wait!!!"</p><p></p><p>Just then, the Grand Elder of the Daoyan Sect arrived, with an angry tone, containing everyone.</p>

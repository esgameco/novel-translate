        <h1>Chapter 282</h1>
        <div class="content">
            <p>Here is the full English translation of the Chinese excerpt:</p><p></p><p>Liu Tu and Liu Qing couldn't help but heave a sigh of relief. üò≤‚ôû‚ùª‚ûà≈ü–Ω√πùêó.ƒÜ·óùùì∂‚úã‚ôñ</p><p></p><p>Seeing this, Li Shuyan glanced at Fu Liangcai and hurriedly turned around and followed him.</p><p></p><p>Fu Liangcai immediately understood, looking at Liu Tu and Liu Qing, cupping his hands and saying, "Elder Liu Tu, Clan Leader Liu Qing, how about we join forces to eliminate the Ouyang Clan, Xu Clan, and Gao Clan?"</p><p></p><p>As a clan leader, he was not stupid. He must seize this opportunity to annihilate the Ouyang and other clans!</p><p></p><p>Hearing this, Liu Tu hurriedly put down his Shenyang Realm cultivation and cupped his hands with a dry laugh, "Excellent, excellent!"</p><p></p><p>Liu Qing also laughed awkwardly, "Clan Leader Fu's words are absolutely right. The Ouyang and other clans have been rampant in Jingyu City, committing all kinds of misdeeds, and we of the Liu Clan have long been unable to tolerate it!"</p><p></p><p>"Clan Leader Fu may not believe this, but we of the Liu Clan went to ambush the Ouyang Clan this time just to support your clan. We wanted to eliminate the Ouyang Clan's main camp and then immediately come to support your clan, but who knew the Ouyang Patriarch had broken through to the middle Shenyang Realm."</p><p></p><p>"It was our miscalculation."</p><p></p><p>Hearing this, the members of the Fu Clan responded with a polite yet awkward smile: "Hehe."</p><p></p><p>But Ouyang Nuo, Xu Chong, Gao Teng, and many other clan members were full of despair.</p><p></p><p>Even if that mysterious blue-robed person didn't act, the Shenyang Realm Liu Clan Patriarch alone was enough to annihilate them...</p><p></p><p>One misstep, and it becomes a grudge for a thousand years.</p><p></p><p>Ouyang Nuo's heart was filled with grief, and his fists suddenly burst with golden light as he roared:</p><p></p><p>"Kill!!!"</p><p></p><p>.........</p><p></p><p>The next day, the air in Jingyu City was filled with the stench of blood.</p><p></p><p>As expected, the Ouyang Clan, Xu Clan, and Gao Clan were all annihilated.</p><p></p><p>This reshuffle has greatly changed the landscape of Jingyu City.</p><p></p><p>Only the Fu Clan and the Liu Clan remained as the two major clans, and there were no longer any clans like the Xu and Gao Clans that could pose a significant threat to them.</p><p></p><p>Of course, the resources of the annihilated clans will also be divided between the Fu Clan and the Liu Clan.</p><p></p><p>With these resources, the survivors will undoubtedly rise to a higher level.</p><p></p><p>Especially the Fu Clan, whose hegemonic position is temporarily stabilized.</p><p></p><p>Everyone knows that there is a late-stage Shenyang Realm sword cultivator grandmaster in the Fu Clan!!</p><p></p><p>Originally, the Fu Clan would have been annihilated in this great battle, but it was because of this powerful sword cultivator that he slew the Ouyang Patriarch with a single sword, forcibly pulling the Fu Clan out of the brink of destruction!</p><p></p><p>.........</p><p></p><p>At the same time, in the main hall of the Fu Clan,</p><p></p><p>Fu Liangcai and a group of elders stood there, not sitting down, not because of anything else, but because the Liu Clan Patriarch and Clan Leader were also present.</p><p></p><p>After all, the Fu Clan no longer had a Patriarch, while the Liu Clan Patriarch still existed. In a certain sense, if it weren't for the one residing in their clan, the Fu Clan would not be as good as the Liu Clan.</p><p></p><p>And that person will eventually leave, so they certainly cannot be arrogant and complacent, forgetting their original heart!</p><p></p><p>Facing the Liu Clan, they must never be high and mighty.</p><p></p><p>Liu Tu and Liu Qing exchanged a glance, with a smile in their eyes, slightly satisfied.</p><p></p><p>This Fu Liangcai actually didn't take the opportunity to suppress their Liu Clan, and gave them face, not bad.</p><p></p><p>"Hehe, Liangcai, please sit, no need to be so polite."</p><p></p><p>Liu Tu cupped his hands and smiled.</p><p></p><p>Fu Liangcai smiled slightly and cupped his hands, "Elder Liu Tu, please don't tire yourself out. You should sit first, you are the elder, and we are the juniors after all."</p><p></p><p>Liu Tu nodded, inwardly satisfied, and immediately sat down with a sweep of his sleeve.</p><p></p><p>Soon, everyone was seated.</p><p></p><p>Fu Liangcai waved his sleeve, and a number of storage rings appeared on the table, smiling, "Elder Liu Tu, Clan Leader Liu, all the resources of the Ouyang Clan, Gao Clan, and Xu Clan are in these."</p><p></p><p>Hearing this, everyone's eyes instantly became fiery hot!!</p><p></p><p>They knew very well what these rings represented, and the resources contained in them could definitely take their two clans to a higher level of overall strength!</p><p></p><p>After a brief moment of silence, Liu...</p><p></p><p>Here is the full English translation of the Chinese excerpt:</p><p></p><p>The blue-eyed person smiled and asked, "Elder Fu, how should we divide these resources between our two clans?"</p><p></p><p>Fu Liangcai gave a slight smile and extended five fingers, saying, "A fifty-fifty split."</p><p></p><p>Liu Tu and Liu Qing were suddenly shocked. </p><p></p><p>They had expected to get a thirty-seventy split at best, but they never imagined it would be a fifty-fifty split! After all, fifty percent was an incredibly generous offer.</p><p></p><p>Fu Liangcai had shown great magnanimity!</p><p></p><p>Liu Qing's throat tightened for a moment. He stood up, cupped his hands, and said solemnly, "Brother Fu, this is too much."</p><p></p><p>Fu Liangcai stood up and said with pursed lips, "Clan Leader Liu, now that only our two clans remain in Jingxun City, we should work together for development. Besides, my clan's ancestor has passed away, so even fifty percent would be more than I deserve."</p><p></p><p>He had laid his cards on the table.</p><p></p><p>Hearing this, Liu Qing no longer said anything more, just silently sat back down, feeling a tinge of shame in his heart.</p><p></p><p>To be honest, if he had not been so ambitious and happened to attack the Ouyang Clan, his Liu Clan might have been destroyed as well.</p><p></p><p>At this time, Liu Tu shook his head and chuckled, "Liangcai, Liu Qing, you two are still young, after all."</p><p></p><p>Huh?</p><p></p><p>Fu Liangcai and Liu Qing exchanged puzzled glances, and the elders also looked at each other in confusion.</p><p></p><p>Seeing their puzzlement, Liu Tu waved his sleeve, stood up, and pointed upwards, smiling as he said, "These resources should be offered to that senior. In other words, without that senior's consent, we have no right to pocket these resources ourselves."</p><p></p><p>"As clan leaders, do not let the immediate benefits blind you and bring about your own destruction!"</p><p></p><p>The hall fell silent.</p><p></p><p>Fu Liangcai and Liu Qing's faces turned pale, and beads of sweat rolled down their foreheads.</p><p></p><p>They had indeed been blinded by the benefits and had not even considered this simple social etiquette.</p><p></p><p>It seems the old are indeed wiser.</p><p></p><p>"Elder (Senior Liu) is right," Fu Liangcai and Liu Qing quickly responded.</p><p></p><p>"Mm-hmm," Liu Tu nodded slightly, then glanced at the many rings on the table and said, "Liangcai, you should take these resources and let that senior dispose of them."</p><p></p><p>He and Liu Qing would not go themselves, as they were not familiar with that senior, and it would be better not to interfere with that senior's affairs.</p><p></p><p>"Mm-hmm."</p><p></p><p>...</p><p></p><p>Outside the most luxurious guest room of the Fu Clan.</p><p></p><p>Li Shuyan had been dozing off while holding Zhan Xu, when his brow suddenly furrowed, and he opened his eyes, looking over.</p><p></p><p>Moments later, he saw Fu Liangcai quickly approaching.</p><p></p><p>"Clan Leader Fu, what's the matter?" Li Shuyan immediately asked.</p><p></p><p>Fu Liangcai gave an embarrassed smile and bowed respectfully. He knew this attendant of Senior L√º was also very strong, at the Spiritual Origin Realm Eighth Transformation.</p><p></p><p>He then said, "I have come to hand over the resources obtained from the destruction of the Ouyang and other clans to Senior L√º."</p><p></p><p>Hearing this, Li Shuyan raised his eyebrows slightly, but it was a good, cautious move.</p><p></p><p>He nodded and then turned around, respectfully calling out, "Master, Clan Leader Fu has come to pay his respects."</p><p></p><p>Moments later, L√º Changsheng's lazy voice came from the room, "Keep the resources for yourself, I don't want them."</p><p></p><p>Fu Liangcai's lips moved, feeling uneasy, wanting to say something, but then he said, "Senior..."</p><p></p><p>"Shuyan, go take a look and see if there's anything you need," L√º Changsheng's voice came from the room again.</p><p></p><p>Hearing this, Fu Liangcai finally felt much more at ease. He was afraid of being given too much, but he was even more afraid of being given nothing at all!</p><p></p><p>"Yes, Master." </p><p></p><p>Li Shuyan bowed respectfully, then looked at Fu Liangcai: "Let's go."</p><p></p><p>Seeing this, Fu Liangcai quickly led Li Shuyan towards the main hall.</p><p></p><p>At the same time,</p><p></p><p>Outside a secluded courtyard of the Fu Clan, Fu Tao stood outside, his face full of worry as he called out, "Sister, are you feeling better?"</p>

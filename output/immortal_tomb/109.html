        <h1>Chapter 109</h1>
        <div class="content">
            <p>Here is the full English translation of the Chinese excerpt:</p><p></p><p>Gulp...</p><p></p><p>Lei Ge swallowed. The new 69 book bar 99 SHUX.COM</p><p></p><p>Immortal, Immortal King, what are they? Hearing this sounds so arrogant.</p><p></p><p>But remembering the scene just now where the chains that had imprisoned him for hundreds of thousands of years were easily broken, his heart calmed down a bit.</p><p></p><p>That was the method of the Patrol Chief Palace Master. Even though those chains had lasted for hundreds of thousands of years, to break them, at least one would need to be at the late stage of Xian Jun or have cultivation similar to the Patrol Palace Master.</p><p></p><p>Immortal King...</p><p></p><p>Lei Ge looked at Lu Changsheng's back with reverence and slowly followed, dragging his aching and weary body.</p><p></p><p>At the same time, he was strenuously circulating the immortal elemental force within his body to heal his injuries.</p><p></p><p>It seems there will be a fierce battle next.</p><p></p><p>This senior came to rescue him, no matter what, he cannot be a drag!</p><p></p><p>"Who are you? How dare you sneak into the Patrol Palace!"</p><p></p><p>Soon, two silver-ranked Patrol Envoys approached, slowly closing in!</p><p></p><p>They saw the freed Lei Ge, their pupils constricting, then their gaze shifted to Lu Changsheng!</p><p></p><p>Lei Ge took a deep breath, clenching his fists. Even with his current injuries, he should still be able to handle two Da Luo Golden Immortals, right?</p><p></p><p>As a Xian Jun, in his prime, even if he was only at the first rank, he could easily crush hundreds or even thousands of Da Luo Golden Immortals!</p><p></p><p>Just as he was about to fight, Lu Changsheng suddenly said softly, "Self-destruct."</p><p></p><p>At the same time, the Great Dao Eye in his pupils flashed.</p><p></p><p>"Self-destruct? What are you playing at...oh, I see."</p><p></p><p>The two Patrol Envoys were about to mock, but their expressions suddenly became dazed. Weapons appeared in their hands, and without hesitation, they slashed their own carotid arteries!</p><p></p><p>Whoosh, blood sprayed everywhere!</p><p></p><p>But as Da Luo Golden Immortals, how could they die so easily?</p><p></p><p>So they then viciously stabbed their own hearts, mashing their hearts to pieces, and finally shattered their own Da Luo Golden Elixirs in their sea of consciousness!</p><p></p><p>Only then did they collapse to the ground, dead.</p><p></p><p>"......"</p><p></p><p>Lei Ge was dumbfounded.</p><p></p><p>As a mighty Xian Jun, he was shocked by the bizarre scene before him.</p><p></p><p>Letting him kill Da Luo Golden Immortals would be easy, no different from stepping on an ant. But making the ants willingly kill themselves, he couldn't do that, unless he had previously implanted control measures in their bodies!</p><p></p><p>Lu Changsheng stepped over the two corpses and continued towards the Imprisoned Heavenly Prison.</p><p></p><p>Lei Ge silently followed.</p><p></p><p>But just as he was about to step over the bodies, he suddenly thought of something, then quickly found the spatial pouches of the two Patrol Envoys, taking out the various restorative and healing pills and eating them while storing them away.</p><p></p><p>In his current situation, pills were exactly what he needed. As for the rest, as a Xian Jun, he naturally looked down on them.</p><p></p><p>.........</p><p></p><p>"Hehe, all of you lie down, next the Palace Master will inspect your..."</p><p></p><p>Jin Yang swept his gaze over the 180-odd disheveled female Patrol Envoys, his face full of sinister smiles, but before he could finish, his expression suddenly froze!</p><p></p><p>A fierce light flashed in his eyes, and a low roar suddenly exploded throughout the celestial palace!</p><p></p><p>"All Patrol Envoys, go to the Imprisoned Heavenly Prison!! Surround and kill them!"</p><p></p><p>Jin Yang clenched his fists, his gaze icy cold!</p><p></p><p>Someone actually dared to raid the Patrol Palace and free the prisoner? This is too much!</p><p></p><p>Unexpectedly, that Lei Ge still had a helper!</p><p></p><p>Before the Palace Master extracts the precious treasures within your bodies, don't even think about escaping!</p><p></p><p>"Chief, Chief Palace Master!" </p><p></p><p>The group of female Patrol Envoys were panic-stricken, hastily straightening their clothes.</p><p></p><p>"Scram, didn't I just say all Patrol Envoys are to go to the Imprisoned Heavenly Prison? Didn't you hear?"</p><p></p><p>Jin Yang glared at the group of beauties in a low voice, having already lost interest at this point.</p><p></p><p>With that, he disappeared first.</p><p></p><p>The one who dared to raid the prison and break the Imprisoning Dragon Shackles he had placed on Lei Ge seems to have some strength, even though those shackles had not been replaced for hundreds of thousands of years.</p><p></p><p>That person, could possibly also be an Immortal King.</p><p></p><p>First, let the subordinates hold them back.</p><p></p><p>Here is the full English translation of the Chinese excerpt:</p><p></p><p>Patrolling the palace, imprisoned in the celestial prison.</p><p></p><p>Countless patrol officers frantically rushed into the celestial prison.</p><p></p><p>And those circling in the sky, there were about a few thousand in total...</p><p></p><p>In other words, at least a few thousand immortal celestials and dozens of great immortal celestials surrounded Lu Changsheng and Lai Ge!</p><p></p><p>"Enter, enter, all of you enter! Whoever discovers the jailbreaker, execute them on the spot! Whoever can slay the jailbreaker today, a bronze badge will be upgraded to silver, a silver badge to gold!"</p><p></p><p>A few gold-badge patrol officers at the entrance of the celestial prison commanded passionately.</p><p></p><p>"Yes!" Many patrol officers were delighted, this was practically a gift-wrapped achievement.</p><p></p><p>Especially for those who had just joined the Patrol Palace today, they smiled, not expecting to encounter such a good opportunity right after joining.</p><p></p><p>If they were lucky enough to slay that jailbreaker, wouldn't they be directly promoted?</p><p></p><p>Inside the celestial prison.</p><p></p><p>Lu Changsheng was walking slowly in the front.</p><p></p><p>Lai Ge was following behind him, feeling somewhat frightened and apprehensive. He had also heard the furious shout from the Grand Patriarch Jin Yang just now.</p><p></p><p>At this moment, as he sensed the vast aura outside, it seemed they had been surrounded.</p><p></p><p>And Jin Yang would likely arrive soon as well.</p><p></p><p>Just then, a multitude of mighty immortal energies surged forth, blanketing the spacious corridor!</p><p></p><p>Those were the patrol officers who had just flooded in.</p><p></p><p>"Senior, let me handle these cannon fodder..."</p><p></p><p>Lai Ge stepped forward, his palms shimmering with golden light, speaking with some solemnity.</p><p></p><p>Lu Changsheng glanced at him, "Then you go."</p><p></p><p>He then retreated a step, giving Lai Ge some space.</p><p></p><p>Seeing this, Lai Ge's gaze hardened, and he roared, "Senior, please stay behind me! I will definitely deal with these cannon fodder properly!"</p><p></p><p>Afterward, the immortal energy in his body forcefully erupted, and he took a step forward with his tiptoes.</p><p></p><p>But just as he had taken a single step,</p><p></p><p>"Pu!"</p><p></p><p>Lai Ge coughed up a mouthful of fresh blood, and his spiritual essence and the immortal energy within him withered.</p><p></p><p>He had still underestimated the severe injuries he had accumulated over tens of thousands of years in this celestial prison.</p><p></p><p>It was not something that could be recovered from in a short time.</p><p></p><p>"Cough, senior, it seems I lack the strength..." Lai Ge's face was deathly pale, and he felt somewhat embarrassed. The previous action had further aggravated his internal injuries.</p><p></p><p>He was saddened in his heart, a mighty Chaos Immortal Lord, but now he was no different from a cripple.</p><p></p><p>"Just follow me," Lu Changsheng said, pursing his lips and continuing to walk.</p><p></p><p>Lai Ge felt ashamed, but then he forced himself to stand up and limp after him.</p><p></p><p>At this moment!</p><p></p><p>The gathered patrol officers, carrying their savage immortal energies, had finally arrived!</p><p></p><p>Lu Changsheng simply pointed a finger, and all the patrol officers in front, along with their immortal energies, were instantly frozen, as if they had been transported from warm water to an extremely frigid space.</p><p></p><p>They were instantly turned into ice sculptures!</p><p></p><p>Gulp.</p><p></p><p>Lai Ge swallowed hard.</p><p></p><p>Then, with each step Lu Changsheng took, these frozen patrol officers shattered one by one.</p><p></p><p>Boom, boom, boom, boom, boom...!</p><p></p><p>The sound of shattering echoed endlessly, accompanied by the scattering of ice shards and flesh fragments.</p><p></p><p>The patrol officers who had just arrived, seeing this terrifying scene in the celestial prison corridor, involuntarily halted their steps, their trembling pupils reflecting the slowly approaching young man in blue.</p><p></p><p>"Ugh...!"</p><p></p><p>Overcome by fear, they began to retreat from the celestial prison, but they had not retreated far when they too were caught by the icy fate!</p><p></p><p>Crack, crack, crack, crack, crack...</p><p></p><p>The icy trails spread crazily and irregularly along the celestial prison corridor. Whoever was touched by them turned into an ice sculpture in an instant!</p><p></p><p>"No, no—Ahhh!!!"</p><p></p><p>The cries of terror were abruptly cut off.</p><p></p><p>At this moment, the entire celestial prison corridor had become a world of ice!</p><p></p><p>Lu Changsheng's lips curled in a slight smile as he stepped on the icy surface, the sound of shattering ice sculptures ringing in his ears, and he continued to walk towards the outside world.</p><p></p><p>Lai Ge's eyes were trembling, his throat rolling, speechless as he followed behind.</p>

        <h1>Chapter 307</h1>
        <div class="content">
            <p>Here is the full English translation of the Chinese excerpt:</p><p></p><p>Duan Jiuxiong's forehead quickly began to sweat, and out of the corner of his eye, he glanced at the unmoving Lu Changsheng in the lineup. </p><p></p><p>He couldn't just say that this big shot had slaughtered them all, could he?</p><p></p><p>If that were the case...</p><p></p><p>Duan Jiuxiong recalled Lu Changsheng's previous words - if the Ancient Wasteland Sword Clan were to arrive, whoever was present, not a single one of them would be allowed to live...</p><p></p><p>Thinking about it sent shivers down his spine. He didn't believe that Lu Changsheng was joking.</p><p></p><p>"Hmm? Jiuxiong? What's going on?" The purple-robed elder once again sensed something amiss and asked in a stern tone.</p><p></p><p>Duan Jiuxiong steadied his nerves and replied, "Sword Executor, the Blood Demon Sect and the Shadow Assassin Tower did not participate in this session of the Heavenly Champion Assembly..."</p><p></p><p>"They did not participate? As top powers, why would they not participate?" The purple-robed elder's tone grew colder.</p><p></p><p>The people present all felt a chill run down their spines.</p><p></p><p>Under the purple-robed elder's intense questioning, Duan Jiuxiong's back was drenched in cold sweat as he stammered, "Uh, it seems their Heavenly Champions were still in seclusion and happened to miss this session of the Heavenly Champion Assembly..."</p><p></p><p>"Absurd!" The purple-robed elder suddenly waved his sleeve in a sweeping motion!</p><p></p><p>Duan Jiuxiong paused, not knowing what else to say, his heart racing with nervousness.</p><p></p><p>The atmosphere in the entire venue had gradually become tense and frozen...</p><p></p><p>"Greetings, Sword Executor, I am Zhou Zhenjiang of the Zhou Clan from the King City." </p><p></p><p>At this moment, Zhou Zhenjiang stepped forward and bowed respectfully.</p><p></p><p>The crowd was greatly surprised, not understanding what Zhou Zhenjiang was about to do!</p><p></p><p>Lu Changsheng also slowly shifted his gaze to Zhou Zhenjiang, his eyes flickering slightly.</p><p></p><p>"Oh? What is it?" The purple-robed elder's brow creased slightly.</p><p></p><p>Zhou Zhenjiang straightened up, looking at Lu Changsheng with a profound gaze, and then, in the horrified eyes of the crowd, said, "Sword Executor, the Blood Demon Sect Master and the Shadow Assassin Tower Master have died, including their Heavenly Champions... This is how it happened..."</p><p></p><p>Soon, Zhou Zhenjiang recounted the previous events in meticulous detail.</p><p></p><p>Lu Changsheng stood quietly, not interrupting him.</p><p></p><p>The square grew increasingly silent, as if it were the depths of winter, and the people felt a chill run through their bodies.</p><p></p><p>The elders of the Nangong Clan and others looked at Zhou Zhenjiang in disbelief!</p><p></p><p>He actually dared to gamble!</p><p></p><p>Did he clearly understand the strength of the mysterious blue-robed figure? Zhou Zhenjiang actually dared to gamble!</p><p></p><p>What if the purple-robed elder could not handle the mysterious blue-robed figure?</p><p></p><p>Zhou Zhenjiang's actions were simply toying with the lives of everyone present!</p><p></p><p>After a moment,</p><p></p><p>Zhou Zhenjiang sneered as he looked at Lu Changsheng, "Sword Executor, this is how the events unfolded... This person is the culprit, having infiltrated the Heavenly Champion Assembly with his profound cultivation, likely with ill intentions towards the Ancient Wasteland Sword Clan!"</p><p></p><p>The purple-robed elder and the two young men's expressions had already changed drastically. They quickly turned to look at Lu Changsheng in the Heavenly Champion lineup, their eyes filled with disbelief!</p><p></p><p>This person killed the Blood Demon Sect Master and the Shadow Assassin Tower Master?</p><p></p><p>"Remove your mask."</p><p></p><p>The purple-robed elder stared at Lu Changsheng and said coldly.</p><p></p><p>However, Lu Changsheng did not heed the purple-robed elder, but slowly walked out of the lineup, smiling at the slightly changing expression of Zhou Zhenjiang.</p><p></p><p>"I'd like to ask, what benefit do you get from revealing this matter?"</p><p></p><p>Zhou Zhenjiang couldn't help but take a step back, saying in a stern voice, "The benefit... As the clan leader, I just can't stand to see you act so arrogantly. How's that?"</p><p></p><p>Lu Changsheng nodded slightly, "Hmm, that's a good answer."</p><p></p><p>"But are you so sure that this so-called Sword Executor can defeat me?"</p><p></p><p>Here is the full English translation of the excerpt from the Chinese novel:</p><p></p><p>The mysterious figure in the azure robe, who had been unveiled, remained calm and unfazed. He felt a tinge of regret, but quickly suppressed it. He then spoke in a stern voice:</p><p></p><p>"Sir, you come from the Ancient Desolate Sword Clan, but even your clan leader won't be able to deal with me!"</p><p></p><p>Lu Changsheng laughed and couldn't help but mock, "Brainless."</p><p></p><p>"Didn't I tell you to take off your mask and listen?" The elder in the purple robe urged again, his robe fluttering without any wind, ready to strike.</p><p></p><p>If what Zhou Zhenjiang said was true, then the mysterious azure-robed figure must be extremely powerful. He wasn't even sure if he could subdue him.</p><p></p><p>To be honest, his own strength wasn't much higher than the Blood Demon Sect Master and the Shadow Assassin Hall Master. It was mainly the identity of being an envoy of the Ancient Desolate Sword Clan that made him formidable.</p><p></p><p>Also, what was the purpose of this mysterious azure-robed cultivator trying to infiltrate the Ancient Desolate Sword Clan through the Grand Celestial Assembly?</p><p></p><p>"Shut up!" Lu Changsheng turned his head and coldly shouted.</p><p></p><p>Boom! The elder in the purple robe was struck back, crashing into the wall at the edge of the plaza, causing the entire wall to collapse with a tremendous commotion.</p><p></p><p>The elder in the purple robe shakily stood up from the rubble, his eyes filled with terror as he looked at the azure-robed figure, not daring to make a move, not even wiping the blood at the corner of his mouth.</p><p></p><p>The plaza fell into a deathly silence. Everyone was stunned, witnessing how the azure-robed mysterious cultivator had simply told the elder from the Ancient Desolate Sword Clan to shut up, and the elder was sent flying.</p><p></p><p>Unbelievable!</p><p></p><p>Zhou Zhenjiang stumbled and fell to the ground, his eyes filled with fear. This azure-robed cultivator was not human!</p><p></p><p>Lu Changsheng appeared in front of Zhou Zhenjiang, looking down at him like a sovereign. "Is this the one you were relying on?"</p><p></p><p>Zhou Zhenjiang kept his head lowered, too afraid to meet Lu Changsheng's gaze, his entire body trembling in great terror.</p><p></p><p>"Hmph," Lu Changsheng sneered and stepped on him, as if crushing an ant.</p><p></p><p>"My lord, Zhenjiang was wrong, please..." Zhou Zhenjiang was terrified, his spiritual art flashing behind him, trying to resist, but it was utterly useless against Lu Changsheng.</p><p></p><p>In an instant, Zhou Zhenjiang and his spiritual art were simply crushed into nothingness by Lu Changsheng's single step.</p><p></p><p>"Father!" Zhou Yuan, standing nearby, was horrified.</p><p></p><p>Lu Changsheng glanced at him, and Zhou Yuan was also erased.</p><p></p><p>A cold wind blew across the plaza, and everyone's souls trembled. Such overwhelming power, effortlessly taking lives like the Grim Reaper.</p><p></p><p>The elder and two young men from the Ancient Desolate Sword Clan were also stunned, their expressions blank, even they were shaken by this display of might.</p><p></p><p>Liu Tu and the others had no idea where they were, their hearts tightening. The azure-robed senior had defeated the elder, so would he now be relentlessly pursued by the Ancient Desolate Sword Clan?</p><p></p><p>Wait, they suddenly realized that the azure-robed senior must have come here specifically targeting the Ancient Desolate Sword Clan.</p><p></p><p>Lu Changsheng swept his gaze across the crowd and said softly, "I believe I mentioned that anyone who dares to speak further will not live, right?"</p><p></p><p>At these words, the entire place fell into a deathly silence.</p>

        <h1>Chapter 443</h1>
        <div class="content">
            <p>Here is the full English translation of the Chinese excerpt:</p><p></p><p>"Elder, Senior Turtle, as long as we cross the chasm ahead, we will reach the entrance to the Hollow Ancient Realm," Ye Xunwang said with some excitement as he pointed ahead.</p><p></p><p>Although he had once quarreled with his parents and left the family, this was still his birthplace.</p><p></p><p>"Tsk tsk, it's really quite remote," the old turtle said with interest.</p><p></p><p>At this moment, Lu Changsheng walked out of the palanquin and looked out in front, indeed seeing a vast moat that seemed to stretch endlessly, as if separating the world on the other side from the heavens and earth.</p><p></p><p>As the palanquin approached the chasm, its speed slowed down.</p><p></p><p>Since the palanquin was controlled by Ye Xunwang, the old turtle looked at him puzzlingly and asked, "Little Ye, why are you slowing down the palanquin's speed?"</p><p></p><p>At the current speed, it would take them ten days or half a month to cross the chasm!</p><p></p><p>Ye Xunwang, however, looked warily at the misty chasm below and replied, "Elder, Senior Turtle, you don't know this, but in the Hollow Ancient Realm, cultivators generally don't dare to cross this chasm too quickly, because there are many dangers within the chasm. If the crossing speed is too fast, it will attract attention."</p><p></p><p>Before Lu Changsheng could speak, the old turtle chuckled mockingly and waved his hand unconcernedly, "Don't worry, just speed up the palanquin. Old Turtle wants to see what kind of sinister thing dares to block the master's path!"</p><p></p><p>Ah?</p><p></p><p>Hearing this, Ye Xunwang's expression immediately became tense.</p><p></p><p>This was no longer the Ancient Kingdom of Yunlan, where he was at the peak of the Spirit Warrior realm. Both the chasm and the Hollow Ancient Realm were far more dangerous than that.</p><p></p><p>"Hurry up, what are you dawdling for?" the old turtle urged.</p><p></p><p>Ye Xunwang glanced at Lu Changsheng out of the corner of his eye and saw that he also had a carefree expression, so he gritted his teeth and accelerated the palanquin's speed!</p><p></p><p>Whoosh—</p><p></p><p>The palanquin's speed suddenly soared, but the resulting commotion was also extremely loud, with a series of sonic booms and rumbles echoing above the chasm!</p><p></p><p>At the same time, on the other side of the chasm, three people were quietly crossing it, likely cultivators of the Hollow Ancient Realm.</p><p></p><p>Whoosh—Boom—</p><p></p><p>The sudden commotion caused the three to change their expressions, looking incredulously towards the source of the disturbance.</p><p></p><p>"What the hell? Who's making such a ruckus in the chasm, not caring about their lives?" one of the young men exclaimed.</p><p></p><p>The old man and woman traveling with him also had shocked expressions.</p><p></p><p>"Uncle, the sound seems to not be too far from us. Shall we go take a look from a distance?" Zhao Yuan frowned.</p><p></p><p>The old man was still pondering, but the young man paled and smiled bitterly, "Sister, let's not get involved in that mess, okay? The one making such a commotion is bound to attract the sinister creatures in the chasm."</p><p></p><p>"We'll just observe from a distance without making a sound. The chasm's monsters seem to be especially sensitive to sound," Zhao Yuan comforted him.</p><p></p><p>As the young man was about to speak again, Zhao Yuan's tone turned cold, "Zhao Gao!"</p><p></p><p>Zhao Gao immediately shut his mouth, not daring to say anything more.</p><p></p><p>"Alright, then let's go take a stealthy look. This old man is also a bit curious," Zhao Kun decided after some thought.</p><p></p><p>So Zhao Kun and Zhao Yuan, with the reluctant Zhao Gao in tow, headed towards the disturbance.</p><p></p><p>...</p><p></p><p>"Tsk, isn't this pretty safe? I don't see the 'many dangers' you were talking about," the old turtle sneered at Ye Xunwang, his tone slightly disappointed.</p><p></p><p>Ye Xunwang, however, dared not let his guard down, because even though the speed was very fast now, it would still take some time to cross the entire chasm.</p><p></p><p>Ye Xunwang couldn't guarantee what would happen next.</p><p></p><p>Here is the full English translation of the Chinese excerpt:</p><p></p><p>"What is it?" Ye Xunmao bitterly said to Luchang Sheng and the old turtle, "Your Excellency, Senior Turtle, perhaps I have been overly anxious..."</p><p></p><p>Luchang Sheng's gaze seemed to pierce through the depths of the abyss, and a blue light flickered in his eyes as he quickly smiled and said, "No, something has indeed been attracted by the movement."</p><p></p><p>Ah?</p><p></p><p>Ye Xunmao was startled, suddenly feeling like he was facing a great enemy!</p><p></p><p>The old turtle was also perplexed, as he hadn't sensed anything at all......</p><p></p><p>"It's here, old turtle, leave it to you," Luchang Sheng suddenly said with a smile.</p><p></p><p>It's here?</p><p></p><p>Ye Xunmao and the old turtle were taken aback, and the next moment, their pupils shrank!</p><p></p><p>The first thing that came into view was a dense mass of tentacles emerging from the mist, each one about a thousand zhang long!</p><p></p><p>At the center of the myriad tentacles was the face of a woman with fangs, who was now staring at Luchang Sheng and the others with a sinister smile.</p><p></p><p>Upon closer inspection, the myriad tentacles were more like the woman's hair strands, and this woman only had a head, without a body.</p><p></p><p>"What the hell is this thing?" Even the experienced old turtle was startled, as he had never seen such a bizarre creature in all his travels.</p><p></p><p>"I-I don't know," Ye Xunmao said fearfully, his heart trembling as he looked at the gigantic demonic face before him.</p><p></p><p>Although Ye Xunmao had lived in the ancient Void Realm before, he had never seen anything like this in the abyss, only having heard about it.</p><p></p><p>And Ye Xunmao had a premonition that he wouldn't even be able to handle a single tentacle of this terrifying creature.</p><p></p><p>Luchang Sheng watched the monster with interest, his expression calm, but his gaze suddenly flashed as he glanced at a certain spot in the abyss.</p><p></p><p>.........</p><p></p><p>"Hiss!! Could this be the legendary Thousand-Tentacle Demoness from the abyss?" Zhao Gao's eyes were filled with terror!</p><p></p><p>Zhao Kun and Zhao Yuan's faces were also grave, even pale.</p><p></p><p>The legend of the Thousand-Tentacle Demoness was because she had once appeared, and it was said that several Deity Realm experts from the ancient Void Realm had fallen at her hands.</p><p></p><p>The legend said the Thousand-Tentacle Demoness had the strength of the Deity Realm, and although they had previously scoffed at the idea, they now believed it after seeing her with their own eyes.</p><p></p><p>Because Zhao Kun himself was at the middle Deity Realm level, but the Thousand-Tentacle Demoness gave him a sense of being undefeatable.</p><p></p><p>"Uncle, Sister, those three people are probably done for, we don't need to watch anymore, let's just get out of here?" Zhao Gao said anxiously, afraid of any further developments.</p><p></p><p>Zhao Kun nodded, it was indeed not wise to linger here. If the Thousand-Tentacle Demoness discovered them, they would likely not be able to escape.</p><p></p><p>The Deity Realm, what a concept. Their Zhao Clan ancestor was only at the Deity Realm, and this abyss was the Thousand-Tentacle Demoness' domain, so even if their ancestor came, they probably wouldn't fare any better.</p><p></p><p>"Sister, why are you spacing out? Let's hurry and get out of here!" Zhao Gao saw Zhao Yuan seemed to be in a daze, and he was almost in tears from the urgency.</p><p></p><p>"Uncle, you all look..." Zhao Yuan suddenly said with uncertainty.</p><p></p><p>Look at what? The Thousand-Tentacle Demoness? They had already seen her.</p><p></p><p>Zhao Kun and Zhao Gao exchanged a puzzled glance, feeling that Zhao Yuan was talking nonsense.</p><p></p><p>"Yuan'er, what are you trying to say?" Zhao Kun frowned.</p><p></p><p>Zhao Yuan stared at the distant Luchang Sheng, disbelievingly saying, "You see that Taoist priest in blue, he's actually smiling at the Thousand-Tentacle Demoness..."</p><p></p><p>Zhao Kun, Zhao Gao: "Ah?"</p>

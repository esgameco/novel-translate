        <h1>Chapter 517</h1>
        <div class="content">
            <p>Here is the full English translation of the Chinese excerpt:</p><p></p><p>The crisp sound of the cracking attracted the attention of everyone, even the battle between Hunhui and the old turtle had paused momentarily!</p><p></p><p>Countless gazes were fixed on the crack on the Great Dao Exorcism Tower with trepidation!</p><p></p><p>The battle had become so fierce that even the priceless Great Dao Exorcism Tower could barely withstand it...</p><p></p><p>The remaining Sacred Demons of the Devouring Void Sect had their pupils constrict!</p><p></p><p>They could never have imagined that this Dao Sovereign of the endless void could fight their eight Supreme Sacred Demon Gods and hundreds of Sacred Demon Emperors to this extent!!</p><p></p><p>This time, the Devouring Void Sect had suffered heavy losses!</p><p></p><p>At least along the way, all the races and worlds they encountered had submitted and trembled before the Devouring Void Sect.</p><p></p><p>Could there really be an unexpected outcome this time?</p><p></p><p>Impossible! They did not believe anyone could single-handedly defeat their eight supreme Sacred Demon Gods!</p><p></p><p>...</p><p></p><p>"Senior brother, I have never seen anyone able to fight against the Master to this extent..."</p><p></p><p>Inside the Qiankun Heavenly Carefree Sect, Lin Dong said in a trembling voice.</p><p></p><p>Throughout, he had never seen anyone able to withstand even a single move from the Master.</p><p></p><p>The intense commotion coming from the Great Dao Exorcism Tower made everyone's hearts race wildly!</p><p></p><p>Tong Xin, with reddened eyes, said, "The Master will win, I have always believed that the Master is invincible, this proves nothing."</p><p></p><p>Crack! Crack! Crack!!!</p><p></p><p>At this moment, cracks spread across the tower like a spider web, and the next instant, the Great Dao Exorcism Tower exploded with a thunderous roar!!!</p><p></p><p>"Boom!!!"</p><p></p><p>Many living beings were startled, staring intently, but found the scene obscured by thick mist, unable to see anything.</p><p></p><p>Everyone stared at the screen, waiting for the mist to dissipate!!</p><p></p><p>As the mist gradually cleared, the scene finally became clear again!</p><p></p><p>In the line of sight, there were fragments of the Great Dao Exorcism Tower, and in the uneven ruins, the eight Sacred Demon Gods lay there, covered in blood, panting heavily, their eyes filled with immense difficulty.</p><p></p><p>As for the hundreds of Sacred Demon Emperors, they had disappeared, most likely annihilated in the great battle.</p><p></p><p>When the last trace of dust cleared, the upright figure holding a sword finally appeared.</p><p></p><p>Lu Changsheng's sword had broken again, his long hair fluttering, his chest slightly heaving, and most importantly, his spotless blue robe had wrinkles and damage!</p><p></p><p>This was the first time Lu Changsheng's clothes had been torn!!</p><p></p><p>It was evident that the Devouring Void Sect was truly powerful!</p><p></p><p>To be able to damage Lu Changsheng's clothing was unprecedented!</p><p></p><p>Immediately, all the Devouring Void Sect members were stunned, grief-stricken, and dejected!</p><p></p><p>This was in stark contrast to the joy and excitement of Hunhui and the old turtle.</p><p></p><p>At this moment, no one noticed where He Xitong, who had accompanied Lu Changsheng into the Great Dao Exorcism Tower, had gone.</p><p></p><p>"Wow!!!"</p><p></p><p>The spectators, seeing the scene on the screen, quickly flushed with excitement, waving their hands and feet enthusiastically!!</p><p></p><p>Their emotions had undergone a complete reversal. Previously, they had been in despair, but now they were overjoyed with the result!</p><p></p><p>The Devouring Void Sect was so terrifying, yet they had only managed to damage the Dao Sovereign's clothing?</p><p></p><p>Just how powerful was the Dao Sovereign!!</p><p></p><p>No wonder, no wonder the Dao Sovereign's face had not shown any signs of tension from the beginning!</p><p></p><p>"Senior brother, the Master has won! The Master is truly invincible!!"</p><p></p><p>Lin Dong exclaimed excitedly.</p><p></p><p>The Carefree Sect was filled with jubilation and cheers, hailing the Sect Master as invincible!!</p><p></p><p>However, Peng Fang and the other elders were in tears, covering their faces and weeping bitterly!</p><p></p><p>They had been so worried, and the emotional contrast was too great for them to bear!</p><p></p><p>...</p><p></p><p>"You... why are you so strong?" Seville asked bitterly.</p><p></p><p>Lu Changsheng did not answer, but slowly raised his short sword and pointed it at Seville and the other eight Sacred Demon Gods, saying indifferently, "You all are quite strong as well. My clothes are even messed up."</p><p></p><p>In truth, Lu Changsheng felt a sense of disappointment. He had still underestimated these Devouring Void Sect members.</p><p></p><p>He had thought he would at least bleed this time.</p><p></p><p>Hearing this, Seville and the other Sacred Demon Gods were utterly shattered, trembling as they stood up, their faces twisted in a sinister grin:</p><p></p><p>"Even if you have defeated us, what does it matter? The eight Creation Pillars have already reached their end!! In the end, this void will still collapse, it's just a matter of time!!!"</p><p></p><p>Immediately, the smiles on the spectators' faces froze, and they fell silent.</p><p></p><p>Here is the full English translation of the Chinese excerpt:</p><p></p><p>"Go, but after going through so many things, going through so many ups and downs in their hearts, the sentient beings have already come to terms with it, the Venerable Tao has already made efforts to save them, even if they die in the end, they don't care anymore, after all, everyone has to die anyway, let alone the culprit Xikong Saint Demon can die before them!!</p><p></p><p>"Even if we die, we will peel off one layer of your skin!!!"</p><p></p><p>At this moment, Saville roared.</p><p></p><p>The next moment, Saville first smashed his own chest with a punch and took out a shining energy crystal from it!!!</p><p></p><p>The other seven Saint Demon Gods did the same!!</p><p></p><p>Saville used his demonic claws to pinch some shining energy crystals and placed them in front of his eyes, sneering:</p><p></p><p>"You should have guessed what this is, right? That's right, this is most of the energy drawn from the Creation Pillar!! Ah, what a mighty energy! It's fascinating~ Hahaha!!"</p><p></p><p>Everyone's eyes stiffened, although many did not know what it meant, but seeing Saville's seemingly frenzied appearance, they knew it was not a good thing!</p><p></p><p>"Dear Venerable Tao, you said that if our god were to release this energy, what a magnificent sight it would be? It's a pity that our god haven't had a chance to absorb it yet!!"</p><p></p><p>Saville first spoke in a sarcastic tone, then turned to grit his teeth.</p><p></p><p>Lu Changsheng pursed his lips, his eyes slightly cold. In fact, this was what he was most worried about.</p><p></p><p>He did not pay much attention to these Xikong Saint Demons, but the energy contained in these eight shining crystals from the Creation Pillar was the key that made him a little troubled!</p><p></p><p>After so many years, the energy absorbed by Saville and the others in these crystals had reached an appalling degree!</p><p></p><p>If the energy were to be released, if not handled properly, it would bring unimaginable disaster to the endless void.</p><p></p><p>At the top of the Eighth Creation Pillar, all the battles had subsided, and it was now quiet to the extreme, with all eyes fixed on this place!</p><p></p><p>Suddenly, Lu Changsheng took a step forward.</p><p></p><p>The Saint Demon Gods like Saville were startled and quickly retreated a step!</p><p></p><p>"Don't come over!! As long as you are willing to let our Xikong Saint Demon clan go, our god will not crush these energy crystals! And we will hand them over to you!!"</p><p></p><p>The sentient beings dared not imagine that the ferocious Xikong Saint Demons had actually surrendered!</p><p></p><p>"Now you know to be afraid."</p><p></p><p>Lu Changsheng smiled faintly, holding his sword and walking slowly forward, each step treading on the hearts of the Xikong Saint Demons, each step making the sentient beings extremely nervous!</p><p></p><p>They did not know what would happen next, nor dared to imagine the tragic consequences if the Xikong Saint Demons, driven to desperation, crushed the energy crystals!</p><p></p><p>"Don't come over!! If you take another step, we will crush the energy crystals!! At most, we'll all die together in the net!!!"</p><p></p><p>Saville and the other demon gods kept retreating, growling.</p><p></p><p>Lu Changsheng's eyes suddenly turned icy cold, and he roared, "You'd better crush them!!"</p><p></p><p>The eyes of Saville and the other demon gods changed, finally realizing that Lu Changsheng would rather die together than let them, the Xikong Saint Demons, go.</p><p></p><p>"Crush it then!! You think we don't dare?!!"</p><p></p><p>Saville let out a low roar, his eyes driven to madness.</p><p></p><p>With a sudden "crack" sound, the eight energy crystals shattered!!!</p><p></p><p>......</p><p></p><p>......</p><p></p><p>PS:</p><p></p><p>Someone asked if it's going to end soon. I'll answer here - it won't end for now. But after this part, the main storyline will be mostly completed, so you can consider it "completed" if you want. </p><p></p><p>The following will be some daily life without the main storyline. I'm sure you've all noticed that the pace of the Creation Pillar is super super fast? I did this on purpose, just wanting to get through it quickly, because I don't like constant fighting, I personally find it uninteresting. The original intention of this book is to be a carefree, leisurely daily life novel. I got a bit carried away later on.</p><p></p><p>So for those who can't wait, after reading this chapter, you can consider it "completed" and leave. For those who enjoy the leisurely daily life, you're welcome to stay and accompany the author.</p><p></p><p>Also, please consider donating a little, as writing books doesn't earn much money. The author relies on the small donations from readers. Every little bit helps.</p><p></p><p>The fastest updates of this error-free novel can be found at www.feixs.com.</p><p></p><p>For mobile, please visit: https://m.feixs.com/chapter-45751-38225636</p>

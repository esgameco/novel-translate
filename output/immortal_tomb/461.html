        <h1>Chapter 461</h1>
        <div class="content">
            <p>Here is the full English translation of the Chinese excerpt:</p><p></p><p>The woman's soul had long been numbed by the relentless tearing and biting. Suddenly, that halo enveloped her, and the years of tearing and biting disappeared.</p><p></p><p>The woman seemed to feel a sense of disappointment and liberation in her heart.</p><p></p><p>Helian looked at the still unconscious woman and waved her hand, sending a mysterious spiritual force into her body.</p><p></p><p>Moments later, the hidden Hexitong by the side covered her mouth as she saw the woman slowly open her eyes.</p><p></p><p>They were eyes that had become utterly murky.</p><p></p><p>Helian glanced at the hidden Hexitong from the corner of her eye, then looked at the woman with a complex expression.</p><p></p><p>"You're still alive... Hetianxun."</p><p></p><p>Although Helian despised this wretched woman, she couldn't help but admire her at this moment. She never imagined that someone could endure for so long in the Abyss of Soul Devouring!</p><p></p><p>Hetianxun... so that was her name...</p><p></p><p>Hexitong's heartbeat quickened.</p><p></p><p>But Hetianxun's next hoarse and extremely weak words caused Hexitong to finally let the tears flow down her cheeks.</p><p></p><p>"I... I... can't... die, Xingxian and Xiaotong... are still waiting for me, Xiaotong... hasn't even met her mother, she must... hate her mother so much......"</p><p></p><p>In that moment, all the resentment and disappointment Hexitong had harbored disappeared without a trace, replaced only by a deep sense of... regret.</p><p></p><p>Her mother had endured torment in the Abyss of Soul Devouring for hundreds of thousands of years, relying solely on the determination to see her and her father again.</p><p></p><p>Such a great maternal love, what right did she have to resent or be disappointed?</p><p></p><p>Hexitong looked at the woman in the puddle with reddened eyes, her breathing becoming more and more rapid, almost to the point of suffocation.</p><p></p><p>She wanted to go and help the woman up from the puddle, she wanted to reunite with her own mother...</p><p></p><p>But Hexitong mustered all her reason, biting her lip firmly to restrain herself. She told herself that she must not do that, for it would only harm her mother.</p><p></p><p>Her father was still waiting anxiously in the Ancestral Heavenly Realm...</p><p></p><p>It didn't matter if she herself was refined, but she had to ensure her mother could safely leave the Qiankun Heavens and reunite with her father. Then they could have another child.</p><p></p><p>Helian glanced at Hexitong, sensing her increasingly disordered breathing, and then said indifferently to Hetianxun:</p><p></p><p>"You continue to stay in this Abyss of Soul Devouring for a while, and I will consider letting you out later..."</p><p></p><p>Saying that, without regard for the puzzled look in Hetianxun's eyes, she gestured to Hexitong and disappeared.</p><p></p><p>Hexitong, with reddened eyes, took one last look at the woman in the puddle, silently mouthing the word "Mother..." before her figure also gradually disappeared into the Abyss of Soul Devouring.</p><p></p><p>Hetianxun, as if sensing something, turned her head with great difficulty, staring blankly at the spot where Hexitong had stood, her murky eyes becoming increasingly hazy...</p><p></p><p>...</p><p></p><p>In the attic.</p><p></p><p>After they returned, Hexitong looked at Helian and said in a serious tone:</p><p></p><p>"I will obediently accept my fate, and even cooperate with the refinement, but please be sure to release... my mother afterwards."</p><p></p><p>Helian nodded slightly, feeling somewhat satisfied, and promised:</p><p></p><p>"Hexitong, you have such a filial heart. Don't worry, that wretched... your mother, the fact that she can still have a breath of life after surviving in the Abyss of Soul Devouring for hundreds of thousands of years, shows that her life is not meant to end. After this, the Clan Leader will release her."</p><p></p><p>Hexitong lowered her gaze and said indifferently, "My meaning is not just to release her from the Abyss of Soul Devouring, but to deprive her of..."</p><p></p><p>Here is my translation of the Chinese excerpt:</p><p></p><p>"If the young master is expelled from the clan, he will no longer be a member of the clan." </p><p></p><p>He Lian's eyes flashed: "Don't worry, the clan leader also has no intention of keeping her in the clan."</p><p></p><p>"You make a heavenly oath, strip my mother of her status as a member of the He clan, expel her from the He clan, and ensure she can never be harmed!" </p><p></p><p>He Xitong suddenly looked up and stared straight at He Lian.</p><p></p><p>He Lian looked at He Xitong deeply, then raised his hand and made a heavenly oath.</p><p></p><p>"Are you satisfied now?"</p><p></p><p>"I'm tired."</p><p></p><p>He Xitong turned and left.</p><p></p><p>Seeing this, He Lian also did not say anything more and left the attic.</p><p></p><p>Outside the attic.</p><p></p><p>He Lian turned and looked at the attic, coldly chuckling in his heart... </p><p></p><p>The heavenly oath, how laughable.</p><p></p><p>Although the clan's sky-shielding formation has not yet been fully formed, it is to shield the aura of the ten-thousand-year calamity body. Now, concealing a small heavenly oath is more than enough.</p><p></p><p>He Lian took a light breath and disappeared.</p><p></p><p>...</p><p></p><p>The next day.</p><p></p><p>Ye Clan, the Offering Hall.</p><p></p><p>Lu Changsheng was holding a score of music and looking at it, when he suddenly glanced sideways at Ye Feng, who was standing by and waiting for orders.</p><p></p><p>"Ye Feng, the confrontation with the He Clan is imminent, what are your thoughts?"</p><p></p><p>The previously lost in thought Ye Feng was startled, and hurriedly laughed awkwardly, "Elder, Ye Feng is just an ordinary disciple of the Ye Clan. For such a major event, how could I have any opinions."</p><p></p><p>"Oh." Lu Changsheng smiled, "The other side has two super ancient clans plus sixty top ancient clans. The strength difference between the two sides is huge. It's not something that can be overcome just by integrating the medium-sized ancient clans. This time, it's quite possible that your Ye Clan will be destroyed."</p><p></p><p>Hearing this, Ye Feng's face turned pale as he forced a smile, "If it is really destroyed, then that is the fate of the Ye Clan. Ye Feng's cultivation is low, there is nothing I can do, I can only share the life and death of the Ye Clan."</p><p></p><p>Lu Changsheng nodded slightly, and picked up the score again.</p><p></p><p>Ye Feng couldn't help but ask, "Elder, when the time comes, will you..."</p><p></p><p>Lu Changsheng did not look up as he said, "When the time comes, what?"</p><p></p><p>Ye Feng lowered his head and said, "Nothing..."</p><p></p><p>"Say it." Lu Changsheng said indifferently.</p><p></p><p>Ye Feng looked up at Lu Changsheng with sincerity and said with difficulty:</p><p></p><p>"Elder, Ye Feng will say something that a disciple of the Ye Clan should not say. Ye Feng has a feeling that based on your personality, you will definitely lend a hand when the time comes. But Ye Feng hopes you won't. After all, you are just a Offering Elder, not one of us from the Ye Clan. It's better for you to leave the Hollow Ancient Realm quickly."</p><p></p><p>In Ye Feng's heart, Lu Changsheng was indeed very powerful, but in the impending great battle, a Spiritual Void cultivator could not really turn the tide of the battle, and would only add meaningless casualties.</p><p></p><p>"Oh? You even know my personality? That's quite interesting, I don't even know my own personality..." Lu Changsheng looked at him with amusement.</p><p></p><p>Ye Feng bit his lip, scratched his head awkwardly and smiled, "Just a feeling."</p><p></p><p>Lu Changsheng put away the score and closed his eyes, "During this period of time staying in the Ye Clan, apart from other things, from your clan's ancestors to the various disciples of the Ye Clan, in my eyes, they are all not bad. I've been quite comfortable here."</p><p></p><p>Ye Feng was puzzled, not understanding what Lu Changsheng was suddenly saying this for.</p><p></p><p>But the next moment, the words that flowed out of the blue-robed man made him tremble in his soul.</p><p></p><p>"So don't worry, as long as I'm here, the sky won't fall."</p>

        <h1>Chapter 436</h1>
        <div class="content">
            <p>Here is the full English translation of the excerpt from the Chinese novel:</p><p></p><p>Wind Changxuan was thrown into the Cloud Mist Heavenly Prison. The evening banquet ended hastily, and no one had the mood to continue enjoying it.</p><p></p><p>Cloud Zeshuang did not immediately execute Wind Changxuan.</p><p></p><p>Postponing the execution of Wind Changxuan was to leave some room for maneuvering when dealing with Wind Luan later.</p><p></p><p>As the ruler of the Cloud Mist Kingdom, Cloud Zeshuang had to consider many aspects.</p><p></p><p>By leaving this retreat, Cloud Zeshuang was afraid that Lu Changsheng would be reckless, and in the end, it would be the Cloud Mist Kingdom that would bear all the consequences.</p><p></p><p>It's better to be prepared for the worst-case scenario, as any matter is best dealt with by being proactive.</p><p></p><p>At the same time.</p><p></p><p>Ye Xunwang brought the charming and captivating dancing girl, who was the lead dancer, to the Observation Pavilion. He was well aware of the old turtle's gaze earlier at the banquet before his departure.</p><p></p><p>"Do you know what to do when you see Senior Turtle?" Ye Xunwang asked calmly.</p><p></p><p>The dancing girl trembled in her heart and quickly replied, "This servant understands."</p><p></p><p>Ye Xunwang nodded without further words.</p><p></p><p>Soon, Ye Xunwang brought the dancing girl to the door of the old turtle's room. He gently knocked on the door and said, "Senior Turtle, this dancing girl admires you greatly and wishes to see you. I've brought her here, will you receive her?"</p><p></p><p>"Let her come in," the old turtle's voice sounded from the room, accompanied by the sound of water, as if he was bathing.</p><p></p><p>"Ahem." Ye Xunwang cleared his throat, hesitating for a moment, "Senior Turtle, about the matter of the Great Prince of the Ancient Wind Luan Kingdom today..."</p><p></p><p>"What are you afraid of? This little Wind Luan, you don't even need your master to step in. Grandpa Turtle can handle it perfectly well for you. Can you rest assured now?" The old turtle's voice sounded again, full of disdain.</p><p></p><p>Upon hearing this, Ye Xunwang felt somewhat relieved, but he was still a little uneasy.</p><p></p><p>After all, the Ancient Wind Luan Kingdom had powerful experts at the Spiritual Realm, and in Ye Xunwang's eyes, the old turtle was also a powerful expert at the Spiritual Realm.</p><p></p><p>The outcome was still uncertain.</p><p></p><p>However, since Senior Turtle was willing to intervene, if any unexpected situation arose, the Azure Robe Senior should not remain indifferent.</p><p></p><p>With this in mind, Ye Xunwang's heart settled a bit, and he then turned and gestured to the dancing girl.</p><p></p><p>The dancing girl bowed and pushed open the door to enter the room.</p><p></p><p>Soon, the sound of the old turtle's lascivious laughter and the dancing girl's exclamations came from the room.</p><p></p><p>Ye Xunwang shook his head and turned to leave.</p><p></p><p>...</p><p></p><p>In the Ancient Wind Luan Kingdom.</p><p></p><p>After learning that Wind Changxuan had been thrown into the heavenly prison by Cloud Zeshuang, the Wind Luan King was first stunned, and then suddenly erupted in rage!</p><p></p><p>"Outrageous! This Cloud Zeshuang!"</p><p></p><p>In the main hall, the Wind Luan King slammed the table and thundered in great anger.</p><p></p><p>The officials in the hall also had grim expressions on their faces. No one had expected the Ancient Cloud Mist Kingdom to have the audacity to imprison their Great Prince of Wind Luan.</p><p></p><p>This was simply arrogance beyond measure!</p><p></p><p>"Your Majesty, the Cloud Mist King is not a reckless and impulsive person. Perhaps there are some hidden reasons behind this?" </p><p></p><p>"Yes, it's possible that the Great Prince was too high-profile and crossed the bottom line of the Cloud Mist King."</p><p></p><p>"Hehe, what nonsense are you all talking about? We Wind Luan now have a Spiritual Realm expert guarding us. No matter what the reason, the Cloud Mist Kingdom is not qualified to provoke us!"</p><p></p><p>"Your Majesty, since the Cloud Mist Kingdom has been so arrogant and without any bottom line, I suggest we don't need to say much more. We should directly send troops to attack the Cloud Mist Kingdom and rescue our Great Prince of Wind Luan! This can also serve as a fuse to completely incorporate the Cloud Mist territory into our Wind Luan Kingdom."</p><p></p><p>"I second the motion!"</p><p></p><p>"I second the motion!"</p><p></p><p>Listening to the officials' words, the Wind Luan King pondered for a moment, his eyes gleaming with determination, and he waved his hand and said:</p><p></p><p>"Good! Convey my order, prepare the entire army, and get ready to march on the Cloud Mist Kingdom!"</p><p></p><p>The Wind Luan King didn't even bother to send a declaration of war, ready to strike the Cloud Mist Kingdom by surprise!</p><p></p><p>"Your Majesty is wise!"</p><p></p><p>Here is the full English translation of the Chinese excerpt:</p><p></p><p>The official called out.</p><p></p><p>At this time, an elderly official expressed his concern:</p><p></p><p>"Your Majesty, would it not be unwise to attack directly without even issuing a declaration of war first... After all, the Crown Prince is still imprisoned in the sky dungeon of Cloud Mist, if Cloud Mist resorts to desperate measures, the Crown Prince may be in grave danger!"</p><p></p><p>Upon hearing this, the officials glanced at each other but did not interject.</p><p></p><p>Regarding the safety of the Crown Prince Feng Changxuan, they naturally did not dare to intervene, as this was best decided by the King himself.</p><p></p><p>They could not simply say: "Your Majesty, let's not bother with the life or death of the Crown Prince, let's just attack directly."</p><p></p><p>If they said that, it would be akin to courting death.</p><p></p><p>The King of the Wind Phoenix Kingdom pursed his lips, a stern look flashing in his eyes, then he said in a deep voice:</p><p></p><p>"Deploy the troops directly. As for my son, if he can be rescued, we will do our utmost, but if it is not possible, I'm sure my son will understand - he is not one to cling to life in fear of death."</p><p></p><p>The officials heard this and secretly heaved a sigh of relief, one by one saying, "The King is wise!"</p><p></p><p>The King of the Wind Phoenix Kingdom looked impassively towards the direction of the ancient Cloud Mist Kingdom, he would lead the troops in person, and after this battle, Cloud Mist would become history.</p><p></p><p>Thinking of this, the King of Wind Phoenix Kingdom said indifferently, "You may all go and prepare, before the great battle, I shall go consult the Elders."</p><p></p><p>"Yes, Your Majesty!"</p><p></p><p>.........</p><p></p><p>Two months had passed.</p><p></p><p>The ancient Cloud Mist Kingdom.</p><p></p><p>During this time, Yun Zeqing always felt uneasy.</p><p></p><p>Because after the Wind Phoenix Ancient Kingdom learned that Feng Changxuan had been thrown into the sky dungeon, they did not make a single move...</p><p></p><p>Because of this, Yun Zeqing specially summoned Ye Xunwang to discuss.</p><p></p><p>"Younger brother, how do you see this matter?"</p><p></p><p>Ye Xunwang, looking at the deeply furrowed brows and anxious Yun Zeqing, couldn't help but comfort him: "Your Majesty, you don't need to worry too much, we have Senior Blue Robe."</p><p></p><p>Yun Zeqing still shook his head and sighed, "Younger brother, I understand what you mean, but to entrust one's fate to others, there are too many uncertain factors..."</p><p></p><p>Hearing this, Ye Xunwang was silent for a moment, then said, "Your Majesty, let me say something unpleasant. Given the current situation, even if the Wind Phoenix has an overwhelming divine realm, apart from relying on Senior Blue Robe, do we have any other way?"</p><p></p><p>Yun Zeqing paused.</p><p></p><p>Ye Xunwang, seeing this, was about to continue saying something, when suddenly an extremely urgent report came from outside!</p><p></p><p>"Your Majesty, the border has received an emergency message, the King of the Wind Phoenix Kingdom is leading the troops in person, the Wind Phoenix army has already defeated the border and is rushing towards the capital!!"</p><p></p><p>What?!</p><p></p><p>Yun Zeqing and Ye Xunwang's expressions changed, they exchanged a glance and abruptly stood up!</p><p></p><p>"Your Majesty! The officials have rushed to the palace hall and request an audience!"</p><p></p><p>"Your Majesty..."</p><p></p><p>One report after another came, causing Yun Zeqing's mind to be in a complete mess!</p><p></p><p>Such an abrupt change of events, without any preparation at all, Yun Zeqing was momentarily unable to catch up.</p><p></p><p>Ye Xunwang supported Yun Zeqing, sighing, "Your Majesty, it's best to go see the officials first, now the most important thing is to urgently deploy in the limited time."</p><p></p><p>Yun Zeqing took a deep breath, steadying his mind, and said hurriedly, "Younger brother, you go inform the Elder about this matter, I shall first go see the officials and make arrangements!"</p><p></p><p>"Mm." Ye Xunwang nodded solemnly.</p><p></p><p>At the same time, in the Observation Tower.</p><p></p><p>Lu Changsheng stood with his hands behind his back on the observation platform, silently gazing into the distance, his eyes carrying a somewhat... indescribable expression.</p>

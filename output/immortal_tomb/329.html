        <h1>Chapter 329</h1>
        <div class="content">
            <p>Here is the full English translation of the Chinese excerpt:</p><p></p><p>"Tap, tap, tap..."</p><p></p><p>As the gentle footsteps sounded, three figures emerged from the mist. ‚ô†üê≥‚ûÖÔºôsƒßùì§◊ê.·∂ú‚ìû‡πìüëªüë§</p><p></p><p>The young man and his tribesmen were startled!</p><p></p><p>Three? </p><p></p><p>In their perception, there were only two auras...</p><p></p><p>In an instant, the young man's expression became slightly more serious!</p><p></p><p>Very strong!</p><p></p><p>The tribesmen also sensed it, and their nerves immediately tensed up. They lined up in front of the young man, taking a fierce stance as they looked at the three approaching figures in the mist.</p><p></p><p>Soon, the three figures became clearer. The one in the lead was a young man in blue robes, with a stooped old man and a taciturn bald man standing on either side of him.</p><p></p><p>Human race? No, that stooped old man was not.</p><p></p><p>Mid-stage Shen Yang Realm?</p><p></p><p>Except for the bald man, neither the young man in blue robes nor the stooped old man could be seen through their cultivation realms.</p><p></p><p>But when had the human race produced such a powerful expert as the young man in blue?</p><p></p><p>The top experts of the human race were generally recognizable to them.</p><p></p><p>Luchang Sheng's group also did not speak at first, just looking at them, and the atmosphere became a bit tense.</p><p></p><p>Ao Xing slightly pursed his lips, parting the tribesmen on both sides, and smiled with a cupped fist salute: "May I ask what guidance the three of you have for us?"</p><p></p><p>Behind Luchang Sheng, Li Shuyan's gaze was extremely grave!</p><p></p><p>Whether it was this young man or the tribesmen guarding him, the feeling he got was that they were difficult to defeat.</p><p></p><p>Is this the God-Demon Battlefield? Even the random tribes they encountered were so strong.</p><p></p><p>At the same time, the old turtle walked out from behind Luchang Sheng and smiled with a cupped fist salute: "Don't worry, we have no ill intentions. We just sensed your auras and came to ask, how do we get to the human territory?"</p><p></p><p>How to get to the human territory?</p><p></p><p>Ao Xing and his tribesmen were slightly puzzled, their gaze falling blankly on Luchang Sheng and Li Shuyan.</p><p></p><p>The two of you standing next to them are human, and you're asking us how to get to the human territory?</p><p></p><p>And most importantly, our Holy Son was just standing behind them, and now he's standing in front... Who in the God-Demon Battlefield doesn't recognize the Holy Son?</p><p></p><p>"Gentlemen, the human territory is located in the southeast direction of the God-Demon Battlefield. As long as you keep going, you will reach it," Ao Xing said with a smile.</p><p></p><p>The old turtle cupped his fist and said, "Thank you."</p><p></p><p>Then he looked at Luchang Sheng, "Master."</p><p></p><p>Luchang Sheng nodded slightly and led the old turtle and Li Shuyan to leave in the southeast direction.</p><p></p><p>Ao Xing's gaze flashed slightly as he looked at the leading Luchang Sheng and probed, "Blue-robed friend, I am Ao Xing of the Dragon Tribe. May I know your honorable name?"</p><p></p><p>Dragon Tribe Ao Xing?</p><p></p><p>The old turtle and Li Shuyan frowned slightly, feeling like they had heard this name before, but couldn't quite recall it at the moment.</p><p></p><p>"Luchang Sheng."</p><p></p><p>The voice came, and Luchang Sheng's group had already disappeared into the war mist.</p><p></p><p>"Luchang Sheng..." Ao Xing murmured to himself.</p><p></p><p>This surname was unheard of.</p><p></p><p>"Holy Son, that blue-robed human and the hunchbacked old man of unknown race are very strong. They may be newcomers to the God-Demon Battlefield," one of the tribesmen said in a solemn voice.</p><p></p><p>Ao Xing neither confirmed nor denied it, saying, "I have already guessed as much."</p><p></p><p>He looked up at the three great rankings in the sky and said softly, "Otherwise, how could there be anyone in this God-Demon Battlefield who does not know the name of Ao Xing?"</p><p></p><p>"Holy Son is invincible!" </p><p></p><p>All the tribesmen bowed and exclaimed in unison.</p><p></p><p>Ao Xing smiled and looked at the direction where Luchang Sheng had disappeared, saying, "After the Extermination Sword Sovereign, the human race may have added another powerful figure to the rankings."</p><p></p><p>The tribesmen's gazes sharpened, the human race indeed could not be underestimated.</p><p></p><p>...</p><p></p><p>"That young man just now, he was actually the legendary Dragon Tribe..."</p><p></p><p>Here is the full English translation of the Chinese excerpt:</p><p></p><p>"It's truly the battlefield of the warring gods and demons, the Dragon Clan... should be terrifyingly powerful, right?" Li Shuyan exclaimed in awe, recalling the figures he had just seen.</p><p></p><p>However, the old turtle did not seem to have heard him, but instead frowned and said, "How strange, I feel like I've heard the four words 'Dragon Clan Ao Xing' somewhere before."</p><p></p><p>Li Shuyan was startled, and turned his head in shock, "Senior Turtle, you feel the same way?"</p><p></p><p>The old turtle was dumbfounded, "You also feel like you've heard the four words 'Dragon Clan Ao Xing' before?"</p><p></p><p>Li Shuyan solemnly nodded.</p><p></p><p>The old turtle's eyes flickered, this was definitely not a coincidence, it seems the matter was not that simple.</p><p></p><p>Lu Changsheng, who was walking in front, sighed lightly and turned around, pointing upwards, "Instead of racking your brains, you two might as well take a look up there."</p><p></p><p>Huh?</p><p></p><p>The old turtle and Li Shuyan were stunned, and looked up at the sky in confusion. </p><p></p><p>What did he want them to see? Apart from the prominent three major rankings, there was nothing else in the sky...</p><p></p><p>Quack?</p><p></p><p>But the next moment, the two of them simultaneously let out a duck-like cry, suddenly enlightened as they looked at the ranking in the middle.</p><p></p><p>The Divine Body Ranking, third place, the Primordial Dragon Body, Dragon Clan Ao Xing!</p><p></p><p>Goodness, no wonder it sounded familiar, it turns out that young man was on the ranking, and even ranked among the top three on the Divine Body Ranking!</p><p></p><p>They had previously focused most of their attention on the Myriad Tribes Ranking and the Individual Combat Strength Ranking, only briefly glancing at the Divine Body Ranking.</p><p></p><p>"Wow, so strong!" Li Shuyan exclaimed in shock.</p><p></p><p>To think that upon entering the Battlefield of Gods and Demons, they would encounter such a powerful figure on the rankings. Ah, it seems that his Divine Yang Realm is still too weak in this Battlefield of Gods and Demons.</p><p></p><p>Li Shuyan couldn't help but feel a little discouraged.</p><p></p><p>To be honest, the Dragon Clan members they had just faced, not to mention that Ao Xing, even the other clansmen had given him a sense of being undefeatable.</p><p></p><p>"What's wrong, Shuyan? Feeling discouraged?" The old turtle asked with a smile.</p><p></p><p>Li Shuyan gave a bitter smile, "Senior Turtle, ever since I followed the Master out of the Ancestral Heavenly Realm, I have been feeling discouraged everywhere I go, be it the Eternal Vast Realm or the Battlefield of Gods and Demons. In the end, I come from the barren Ancestral Heavenly Realm, my foundation is too shallow."</p><p></p><p>"Take it slow," the old turtle comforted, patting his shoulder.</p><p></p><p>Lu Changsheng continued to walk on with his hands behind his back. Seeing this, Li Shuyan collected his thoughts and followed the old turtle.</p><p></p><p>"Li Shuyan," Lu Changsheng suddenly called out.</p><p></p><p>"Ah, Master, I'm here," Li Shuyan quickly ran to Lu Changsheng's side, keeping half a body's distance and bowing.</p><p></p><p>"How is the Myriad Flames Blazing Body cultivation going?" Lu Changsheng asked.</p><p></p><p>Li Shuyan hesitated, carefully saying, "To be honest, I don't know. It's just that the flame intensity in the Eternal Vast Realm's Flame Mountain... is a bit insufficient."</p><p></p><p>Lu Changsheng nodded slightly, "As long as you have flames strong enough to refine the body, and cultivate the Myriad Flames Blazing Technique to great accomplishment or even perfection, the physical strength may not be inferior to the Primordial Dragon Body on the Divine Body Ranking."</p><p></p><p>Li Shuyan was shocked. Although he did not know how powerful the Primordial Dragon Body was, for it to be ranked third on the Divine Body Ranking, it must be extremely formidable. Yet the Master said the Myriad Flames Blazing Technique could match it? </p><p></p><p>He was overjoyed!</p><p></p><p>But just as his smile was about to blossom, Lu Changsheng poured a bucket of cold water on him:</p><p></p><p>"Of course, that's only in terms of physical strength. The Myriad Flames Blazing Technique is after all just a cultivation method, while those on the Divine Body Ranking possess special constitutions. Strength is only one aspect, the more important thing is that they have other unique qualities."</p><p></p><p>Li Shuyan's smile faltered slightly, and he respectfully said, "Master, as long as the physical strength can match the Divine Body, I am already very satisfied with the power of the Myriad Flames Blazing Technique."</p><p></p><p>Lu Changsheng paused in his steps, turning to look at him and saying indifferently, "Are you truly satisfied?"</p>

        <h1>Chapter 82</h1>
        <div class="content">
            <p>Here is the full English translation of the Chinese excerpt:</p><p></p><p>The sky,</p><p></p><p>The ominous storm clouds pressed down, making it hard for everyone to breathe, even though they were not within the range of the thunderstorm.</p><p></p><p>"It's the Ninety-Nine Purple Lightning Tribulation! Heavens, Fellow Daoist Zhang's aptitude is truly terrifying!"</p><p></p><p>"Yes, normally the great tribulation one faces during the Ascension Cultivation is the ordinary Ninety-Nine Heavenly Tribulation."</p><p></p><p>"Ah, Fellow Daoist Zhang must be having a hard time."</p><p></p><p>"......"</p><p></p><p>In the mouths of Old Turtle and Chu Xiruo, the relatively weaker Ninety-Nine Purple Lightning Tribulation was an extremely terrifying existence in the eyes of the cultivators.</p><p></p><p>The sky.</p><p></p><p>Zhang Youdao's robes fluttered, his gaze resolute!</p><p></p><p>He had long since guessed that his Ascension Tribulation would be the Ninety-Nine Purple Lightning Tribulation, so he had made ample preparations beforehand and was not that panicked.</p><p></p><p>According to his own estimation, the success rate of passing this Ascension Tribulation was 60%!</p><p></p><p>Rumble!!</p><p></p><p>The storm clouds rolled, the purple lightning flashed, heralding the arrival of the first wave of the tribulation!</p><p></p><p>"The Patriarch must succeed in passing this!"</p><p></p><p>Seeing the terrifying heavenly thunder, the countless elders and disciples of the Xiaoyao Sect all prayed silently in their hearts.</p><p></p><p>Soon, a flash of light burst forth in the sky, almost blinding the eyes!</p><p></p><p>Accompanied by a cracking sound, nine purple tribulation lightning bolts as thick as two fingers struck down fiercely!</p><p></p><p>"The first three waves of tribulation lightning, I will withstand them with my body!!"</p><p></p><p>The well-prepared Zhang Youdao let out a startled cry and shot up like a meteor!</p><p></p><p>This scene left many cultivators with dry mouths and tongues; they could imagine that if they were in his place, they would be instantly reduced to ashes upon being struck by the purple lightning.</p><p></p><p>Zhang Youdao and the tribulation lightning collided in an instant.</p><p></p><p>With a rumble, the electric arcs went crazy, and Zhang Youdao's face turned pale, his hair standing on end from the electricity.</p><p></p><p>Seeing this, the crowd let out a sigh of relief, Zhang Youdao had withstood the first wave of tribulation lightning...</p><p></p><p>Next...</p><p></p><p>The second wave of purple lightning tribulation, Zhang Youdao once again mobilized his spiritual energy to withstand it with his body, his complexion growing paler, his clothes tattered.</p><p></p><p>The third wave of purple lightning tribulation, Zhang Youdao still used his body to withstand it, blood finally spilling from the corners of his mouth, his entire body blackened.</p><p></p><p>The fourth wave of purple lightning tribulation, Zhang Youdao had already taken a recovery pill beforehand, he summoned a treasure to resist, but the treasure was shattered by the tribulation.</p><p></p><p>The fifth wave of purple lightning tribulation, Zhang Youdao absorbed most of the lightning's power with the precious lightning-attribute armor he wore, and blocked it again.</p><p></p><p>The sixth wave of purple lightning tribulation, Zhang Youdao used an intermediate Earth Realm technique to resist, but the power of the tribulation was too strong, and he was still struck with severe injuries, but he managed to withstand it.</p><p></p><p>The seventh wave of purple lightning tribulation, Zhang Youdao once again summoned a treasure in the sight of the astonished onlookers, the treasure was shattered, the tribulation dissipated, and he was already severely wounded.</p><p></p><p>The eighth wave of purple lightning tribulation, Zhang Youdao took a top-grade tribulation-crossing pill, his injuries were healed by half in an instant, he activated the Nine Tiered Lightning Control Formation, and withstood the tribulation completely, the formation still intact and with remaining strength!</p><p></p><p>"Incredible! Incredible!"</p><p></p><p>"Fellow Daoist Zhang seems to have prepared a lot for this Ascension Tribulation, step by step, it's so thrilling, yet still within his control..."</p><p></p><p>"Yes, Fellow Daoist Zhang has calculated the time, steps, and various details of the tribulation crossing so meticulously, it seems that only through reasonable allocation can one pass the terrifying Ascension Tribulation!"</p><p></p><p>"I never expected the lightning tribulation could be crossed in this way, this trip was not in vain."</p><p></p><p>"Now it's the last wave of purple lightning tribulation, the Lightning Control Formation still has remaining strength, Fellow Daoist Zhang should be able to pass it, how envious."</p><p></p><p>"......"</p><p></p><p>Rumble!!</p><p></p><p>The next moment, the final nine purple lightning tribulations struck down fiercely!</p><p></p><p>The already battered Zhang Youdao hastily stuffed a pill into his mouth, staring at the descending tribulation lightning with confident laughter: "Haha! Come!"</p><p></p><p>Boom!</p><p></p><p>The nine tribulation lightning bolts struck the Lightning Control Formation, and moments later, the formation shattered, the thunderous power crashing into Zhang Youdao's body!</p><p></p><p>Zhang Youdao's face suddenly turned deathly pale, devoid of blood, and he plummeted from the sky.</p><p></p><p>This scene left the onlookers terrified, could it be that after painstakingly withstanding the tribulation lightning, he would now die from the fall?</p><p></p><p>Here is the full English translation of the Chinese excerpt:</p><p></p><p>At this moment, no one dared to lend a hand, for the calamitous clouds in the sky had not yet dispersed. Whoever dared to help would surely suffer a devastating blow!</p><p></p><p>Just then,</p><p></p><p>Zhang Youdao, with his last ounce of strength, forcibly halted his plummeting body in mid-air!</p><p></p><p>He looked up at the sky, his body covered in blood, but the corners of his mouth were stretched to the limit, and he let out a hearty laugh.</p><p></p><p>"Zhang has overcome the Tribulation of Ascension, so I beseech the Heavenly Dao Lord... to open the Ascension Gateway!"</p><p></p><p>The heavens and earth fell silent for a moment, and suddenly the disciples of the Carefree Pavilion's elders burst into cheers!</p><p></p><p>"Ah! The Patriarch has overcome the Tribulation of Ascension!"</p><p></p><p>Many cultivators also snapped out of their shock, amazed at the spectacle. They had greatly benefited from witnessing this Tribulation of Ascension today.</p><p></p><p>"Congratulations to the Patriarch of the Carefree Pavilion for overcoming the Tribulation of Ascension!"</p><p>"Congratulations, Fellow Daoist Zhang, for overcoming the Tribulation of Ascension!"</p><p>"..."</p><p></p><p>Countless congratulations poured down from all directions.</p><p></p><p>The calamitous clouds in the sky gradually dispersed...</p><p></p><p>The sunlight shone down upon the earth once more...</p><p></p><p>A shimmering, multicolored bridge appeared in the sky, connecting to a certain place in the Spiritual Dust Realm.</p><p></p><p>Creak!</p><p></p><p>At the same time, the sound of a great door opening reverberated through the heavens and earth.</p><p></p><p>Cultivators at the Nascent Soul and higher realms all trembled, their eyes filled with longing, for they knew that the Ascension Gateway had opened!</p><p></p><p>The shimmering aura descended from the multicolored bridge, enveloping Zhang Youdao. His aura began to change...</p><p></p><p>Soon, he had recovered greatly, and his body became purified.</p><p></p><p>Zhang Youdao's figure flashed, and he appeared atop the multicolored bridge in the high heavens.</p><p></p><p>He swept his gaze over the many elders and disciples, a hint of reluctance flashing in his eyes. Finally, he looked towards Jiang Yuan and the others, cupping his hands and saying, "Fellow Daoists, thank you for your protection!"</p><p></p><p>Jiang Yuan and the others hurriedly cupped their hands in return, smiling and saying, "Fellow Daoist Zhang, you are too kind!"</p><p></p><p>They looked at the clearly changed aura of Zhang Youdao, their hearts filled with profound emotions.</p><p></p><p>"From now on, I will rely on all of you for the Carefree Pavilion," Zhang Youdao said, cupping his hands towards the many cultivators.</p><p></p><p>The crowd hurriedly returned the gesture.</p><p></p><p>Zhang Youdao smiled, took one last look at the Carefree Pavilion, and then resolutely turned and stepped onto the multicolored bridge, disappearing from sight, his voice echoing back, "Fellow Daoists, I shall take my leave now. We shall meet again in the Immortal Realm!"</p><p></p><p>"Bid farewell to the Patriarch!"</p><p>"Bid farewell to the Patriarch of the Carefree Pavilion!"</p><p></p><p>Instantly, the many elders and disciples of the Carefree Pavilion bowed in reluctance, and the other cultivators also clasped their hands and bowed.</p><p></p><p>At the same time,</p><p></p><p>The old turtle suddenly looked at Chu Xiran and said, "You must quickly go to the Ascension Gateway!"</p><p></p><p>Chu Xiran: "?"</p><p></p><p>"Fellow Daoist Turtle, what do you mean by this... If you and the others don't go, how can I possibly make it through alone?" Chu Xiran said helplessly, glancing at the closed-eyed Lu Changsheng.</p><p></p><p>The old turtle spoke without emotion, "The Master is already waiting for you at the Ascension Gateway."</p><p></p><p>"Huh?" Chu Xiran looked at the still-seated Lu Changsheng, then back at the old turtle, her face filled with confusion.</p><p></p><p>What the hell?</p><p></p><p>"Believe it or not, you'd better hurry. If you don't go, the Master might enter the Immortal Realm first with that Zhang Youdao, and then you'll just continue to stay in this Spiritual Dust Realm. As for that Ascension Gateway, don't worry, with the Master there, this old turtle is dispensable."</p><p></p><p>The old turtle finished his mocking words and no longer bothered to explain further.</p><p></p><p>Chu Xiran's gaze shifted, and after thinking about Lu Changsheng's previous methods, a resolute expression appeared on her face as she said, "Fellow Daoist Turtle, until we meet again!" and then vanished without a trace.</p><p></p><p>At the same time, the shocked Elder Shen Jingdao, Elder Gu Helin, and others received an urgent message:</p><p></p><p>"Elders, the Demon Realm has invaded the Mortal Realm! There are countless demonic beasts, and many empires have already fallen. You must hurry back!"</p>

        <h1>Chapter 494</h1>
        <div class="content">
            <p>Here is the full English translation of the Chinese excerpt:</p><p></p><p>Upon hearing this, the elder of the Chu tribe was stunned for a moment, then his expression turned to joyful surprise.</p><p></p><p>Judging from the tone of this esteemed person, he actually knows their Chu tribe's Third Young Master?</p><p></p><p>And it seems they have a pretty good relationship!</p><p></p><p>Little Chu Yu has been smart since he was young, he's really done well, to have actually connected with such a prominent figure!</p><p></p><p>The other eight high-ranking members had grim expressions on their faces - they all knew Chu Yu.</p><p></p><p>But they never imagined that Chu Yu from the Chu tribe would be so impressive, actually knowing such a big shot!</p><p></p><p>"Esteemed Sir, our Third Young Master has been doing well recently! In the coming period, the Third Young Master will be attending the grand ceremony held by the Elf Tribe!"</p><p></p><p>The Chu tribe elder hurriedly said.</p><p></p><p>Lu Changsheng nodded, closing his eyes without saying anything further, and no one knew what he was thinking.</p><p></p><p>However, the mood of the group had relaxed a bit, and the eight high-ranking members kept glancing at the Chu tribe elder, signaling him.</p><p></p><p>The meaning was very clear!</p><p></p><p>Your Chu tribe's Chu Yu has such a good relationship with the big shot, so you better help them plead for leniency later!</p><p></p><p>The Chu tribe elder had a proud expression, the meaning also very clear: No problem, no problem.</p><p></p><p>Just then, the laws of heaven and earth suddenly became more violent!</p><p></p><p>Several strands of special connotations appeared without warning!</p><p></p><p>"This, what is this?"</p><p></p><p>The nine high-ranking members' expressions changed drastically!</p><p></p><p>This kind of connotation triggered memories deep in their minds!</p><p></p><p>Top! Top-tier laws!</p><p></p><p>Previously, there had been rising talents in the Sea of Laws who had comprehended laws at the core region, and this kind of connotation had appeared at that time!</p><p></p><p>However, that rising talent ultimately comprehended relatively superior high-level laws, as for these top-tier laws, they had missed the opportunity.</p><p></p><p>But now, these special mysterious top-tier laws appeared again, not just one, but multiple!!</p><p></p><p>The nine high-ranking members looked at the cross-legged old turtle in shock!</p><p></p><p>This turtle was actually so powerful?</p><p></p><p>At the same time, countless cultivators on the Ascending Heaven Island were intently staring at the direction of the central domain, their eyes trembling!</p><p></p><p>Because their laws were actually shivering!</p><p></p><p>As if there was a nemesis of their laws in the central domain!</p><p></p><p>Only a few cultivators who had comprehended high-level laws had their pupils constricted, their expressions filled with disbelief, as if they were gradually understanding!</p><p></p><p>Even the pinnacle high-level laws would not affect them, so the truth could only be one thing!</p><p></p><p>Top-tier laws had emerged!</p><p></p><p>How many years had it been, how many years!</p><p></p><p>In their memories, it seemed only the Junior Palace Master of the Nine Underworlds Palace had once triggered top-tier laws!</p><p></p><p>Although in the end, he still failed to comprehend them!</p><p></p><p>On the shore, there were also countless cultivators standing there stiffly, and on the Sea Runner No. 3, the captain looked at the distance with difficulty.</p><p></p><p>"Captain, the various abnormal phenomena from just now, could it be caused by Senior Blue Robe? I have a strong intuition, after all, Senior Blue Robe is an Arcane Master who should not have appeared on the Ascending Heaven Island."</p><p></p><p>A crew member said tremblingly.</p><p></p><p>The captain bit his sensual lips, silent.</p><p></p><p>.........</p><p></p><p>Time passed, the storm of laws in the core domain finally subsided.</p><p></p><p>Countless laws retreated like the tide in all directions.</p><p></p><p>The nine high-ranking members looked at the cross-legged old turtle in shock, not knowing whether it had truly comprehended the top-tier laws or not.</p><p></p><p>If it had really comprehended the top-tier laws, then this turtle would be the first in the Three Thousand Realms to comprehend the top-tier laws!</p><p></p><p>Unprecedented in the past, and unmatched in the future!</p><p></p><p>If it was an ordinary person who comprehended the top-tier laws, they would definitely be suppressed and eliminated in the cradle.</p><p></p><p>But this turtle was different, with such a powerful master, it would definitely be able to grow and develop safely.</p><p></p><p>At this moment, the old turtle slowly opened its eyes, sitting there blankly for a while, seeming a bit lost in thought.</p><p></p><p>Three top-tier laws!</p><p></p><p>Space, Destruction, Yin-Yang.</p><p></p><p>The only three top-tier laws on the entire Ascending Heaven Island had all been acquired by it!</p><p></p><p>For ordinary people, comprehending even one was extremely difficult, but this turtle had obtained all three!</p><p></p><p>Here is the full English translation of the Chinese excerpt:</p><p></p><p>The Turtle Patriarch had, with the help of his master, mastered a total of three supreme laws!</p><p></p><p>Ordinary people could only possess one supreme law and become top-tier powerhouses, so how could one describe the Turtle Patriarch who had mastered three?</p><p></p><p>However, the Turtle Patriarch also knew that to make these three supreme laws powerful would require far more time and difficulty than ordinary laws or even high-level laws.</p><p></p><p>The three supreme laws he possessed now were like newborn infants, requiring his meticulous care and nurturing.</p><p></p><p>The Turtle Patriarch snapped out of his thoughts, quickly stood up, and approached Luchang Sheng, bowing respectfully, "Thank you, Master."</p><p></p><p>At this moment, with his head bowed, the Turtle Patriarch's mind flashed back to the words he had heard in the illusory space before.</p><p></p><p>Dao Venerable...</p><p></p><p>It sounded impressive, and the Turtle Patriarch had a vague feeling that he had heard it somewhere before.</p><p></p><p>The Turtle Patriarch knew that the "Dao Venerable" mentioned in the supreme laws referred to his master.</p><p></p><p>The Turtle Patriarch regretted not asking more questions at the time when he was shocked, why didn't he ask one more question? Perhaps he could have found the answer then.</p><p></p><p>Luchang Sheng slowly stood up, glancing at the Turtle Patriarch, and said approvingly, "Old Turtle, although you are lazy and undisciplined, your natural talent is indeed impressive, and you have truly succeeded."</p><p></p><p>Although Luchang Sheng had gathered all the laws and created the best conditions for the Turtle Patriarch, he asked himself if he had truly helped the Turtle Patriarch in the subsequent comprehension.</p><p></p><p>Hearing this, the Turtle Patriarch's face flushed red with shame, as those supreme laws had initially shown no interest in him whatsoever.</p><p></p><p>He hurriedly said, "Cough, cough, Master is too kind, it has nothing to do with me, it's mainly because of your prestige."</p><p></p><p>Luchang Sheng raised his eyebrows slightly. His prestige? </p><p></p><p>Thinking about it, it made sense, as the laws on this island could be summoned at his will, indicating that they greatly feared his strength.</p><p></p><p>Ah, too powerful, unable to find a worthy opponent, no choice.</p><p></p><p>The Turtle Patriarch glanced at the nine high-level figures who were restrained, then respectfully transmitted a message, "Master, the thing is, when I was in the illusory space, no matter what I said, the supreme laws would not appear, until I said I was your exclusive mount, and guess what happened next?"</p><p></p><p>Luchang Sheng's brow furrowed, and he stared at the Turtle Patriarch, "Do you really want me to guess?"</p><p></p><p>The Turtle Patriarch was immediately startled, quickly saying, "Master, those three supreme laws completely followed me because of you. They said you are some kind of Dao, a Dao Venerable..."</p><p></p><p>Dao Venerable?</p><p></p><p>In that instant, Luchang Sheng's gaze became slightly unfocused, and numerous fragmented images flashed through his mind.</p><p></p><p>The Turtle Patriarch carefully glanced at Luchang Sheng, not daring to speak and interrupt.</p><p></p><p>At this moment, only Luchang Sheng knew the content of those images, and no one else did.</p><p></p><p>"Phew."</p><p></p><p>Luchang Sheng's pupils refocused, and he let out a light sigh, not dwelling on the matter further, but instead turning to look at the nine high-level figures.</p><p></p><p>Luchang Sheng suddenly smiled and said, "Do you want to live?"</p><p></p><p>The nine high-level figures were overjoyed and frantically nodded their heads, especially the other eight, thinking that Luchang Sheng was looking at them favorably because of the Chu Clan's face, so they cast grateful glances at the Chu Clan elder.</p><p></p><p>The Chu Clan elder's face flushed red, as he had never felt so respected before.</p><p></p><p>However, the words Luchang Sheng casually spoke next left him stunned, and his expression quickly turned to one of infinite terror.</p><p></p><p>"Well then, if you can wipe out the Chu Clan on this island, I will consider giving you a chance to live. How about that?"</p>

        <h1>Chapter 506</h1>
        <div class="content">
            <p>Here is the full English translation of the Chinese excerpt:</p><p></p><p>"Immortal Emperor of Longevity!"</p><p></p><p>Hunhui exclaimed with delight as he saw the blue-robed man gradually materializing before him.</p><p></p><p>The blue-robed man was none other than Lu Changsheng, who had emerged from the Three Thousand Dharma Realms. As for the old turtle, it had been thrown into the Demon-Subduing Tower by him before he had disciplined the Deep Sea Emperor in the Three Thousand Dharma Realms.</p><p></p><p>Lu Changsheng's intention was to let the old turtle make good use of the time flow within the tower to solidify those three supreme Dharma Principles, as he was about to venture to the edge of the Boundless Void.</p><p></p><p>"Immortal Emperor of Longevity!" The Four Great Spirit Generals and the Thirty-Six Demonic Ones hurriedly paid their respects.</p><p></p><p>"Mm, no need for such formalities," Lu Changsheng said with a faint smile, his hands clasped behind his back.</p><p></p><p>After the Four Great Spirit Generals and the Thirty-Six Demonic Ones straightened up, Hunhui was about to say something to Lu Changsheng, but the Reincarnation Demon Child beat him to it, smiling brightly, "Big Brother, back then at the Rebirth Lake, I said we'd meet again, and you said we wouldn't. What do you say now?"</p><p></p><p>Lu Changsheng gave the Reincarnation Demon Child a once-over and smiled, "How do you want me to say it?"</p><p></p><p>The Reincarnation Demon Child paused, slightly averting his gaze.</p><p></p><p>For some reason, making eye contact with this young man made him very uncomfortable. This young man's casual and indifferent attitude was indeed quite similar to the one who had suppressed him in the Great Dao Demon-Subduing Tower.</p><p></p><p>"Immortal Emperor of Longevity, the Rebirth Lake's sealing formation is completely intact, and I don't know how this Reincarnation Demon Child managed to escape..." Hunhui said somewhat embarrassedly.</p><p></p><p>Lu Changsheng gently waved his hand, indicating it was of no consequence, and then looked at the Reincarnation Demon Child, continuing the earlier topic and asking with a smile, "Tell me, how did you know the Boundless Void is about to collapse?"</p><p></p><p>The Reincarnation Demon Child's eyes narrowed, and he bared his teeth, "You want me to tell you, so I have to? I have no face..."</p><p></p><p>But before the Reincarnation Demon Child could finish his arrogant words, Lu Changsheng had grabbed him by the neck of his fate, holding him up in front of him, and said indifferently, "Will you tell me or not?"</p><p></p><p>The Reincarnation Demon Child: "First, let me go. I didn't say I definitely won't tell you."</p><p></p><p>Beside them, Hunhui was dumbfounded.</p><p></p><p>The Four Great Spirit Generals and the Thirty-Six Demonic Ones were also shocked and exchanged bewildered glances!</p><p></p><p>They had previously been puzzled as to why the Soul Emperor was so polite to this Immortal Emperor of Longevity.</p><p></p><p>Now they understood.</p><p></p><p>Incredible!</p><p></p><p>The formidable Reincarnation Demon Child was like a puppet in the hands of the Immortal Emperor of Longevity!</p><p></p><p>Is this truly a Heavenly Emperor?</p><p></p><p>At the same time, they were also delighted!</p><p></p><p>There is hope! There is hope!</p><p></p><p>They had thought that this time, with the Reincarnation Demon Child, the order of this Boundless Void would be thrown into chaos, but now it seems to have been nipped in the bud!</p><p></p><p>Is this what they call "thunder and lightning, but a drizzle"?</p><p></p><p>"Immortal Emperor of Longevity, this... this..." Hunhui stammered.</p><p></p><p>"Don't interrupt," Lu Changsheng said.</p><p></p><p>"Oh." Hunhui obediently fell silent.</p><p></p><p>The high-ranking members of the Soul Realm were silent, seeing the usually majestic Soul Emperor behaving so docilely.</p><p></p><p>"You dare to bargain with me? I'll only count to three, and if you don't speak, then you'll die," Lu Changsheng said indifferently.</p><p></p><p>The Reincarnation Demon Child paused, then said defiantly, "I'm hard to kill and hard to destroy!"</p><p></p><p>Lu Changsheng's expression remained unchanged. "Then you can try."</p><p></p><p>"You!" The Reincarnation Demon Child wanted to continue, but Lu Changsheng had already begun the standard death countdown.</p><p></p><p>"Two."</p><p></p><p>Under this utterly calm countdown, the Reincarnation Demon Child, for some reason, felt an unprecedented sense of anxiety welling up within him. He hurriedly said, "I not only know that the Boundless Void is about to collapse, but I also know the reason! The reason is the eight Creation Pillars at the edge of the Boundless Void!"</p><p></p><p>Lu Changsheng stopped the death countdown, and the corners of his mouth curled up in a smile. "That's a good boy."</p><p></p><p>The Reincarnation Demon Child pursed his lips, and a sense of humiliation he had never experienced before rose in his heart.</p><p></p><p>He had had enough of this blue-robed man's smug attitude! Smug attitude!</p><p></p><p>Hateful! Hateful! Hateful!</p><p></p><p>Ferocious words were on the tip of his tongue, but the Reincarnation Demon Child forced a smile and said, "Big Brother, feel free to ask me anything else. I'll answer everything I know."</p><p></p><p>Beside them, Hunhui and the others were already stunned beyond measure!</p><p></p><p>The Boundless Void is about to collapse...</p><p></p><p>Here is the full English translation of the Chinese excerpt:</p><p></p><p>What? </p><p></p><p>Mother, this news is so shocking! Previously, just hearing the Reincarnation Demon Child say they had some doubts and bewilderment, but now that it's coming from Lu Changsheng, the feeling is completely different.</p><p></p><p>And what is this "Creation Pillar"?! </p><p></p><p>They know the boundless void has edges, but they've never heard of the Creation Pillar before!</p><p></p><p>"I know what you've said, I just want to ask one thing - this place is extremely far from the Creation Pillar, how did you know about it?"</p><p></p><p>Lu Changsheng looked into the Reincarnation Demon Child's eyes and said.</p><p></p><p>It's not that he didn't want to search the Reincarnation Demon Child's soul... but this Reincarnation Demon Child simply didn't have a soul.</p><p></p><p>It was a rather special existence. </p><p></p><p>Calling this thing a dead object wouldn't be quite right, but calling it a living being would also be very off the mark.</p><p></p><p>Hearing this question, the Reincarnation Demon Child's eyes started to evade.</p><p></p><p>Lu Changsheng's gaze turned cold, and light began to emanate from his hand, with added force!</p><p></p><p>"Big Brother, calm down!" </p><p></p><p>The Reincarnation Demon Child was startled!</p><p></p><p>He quickly said, "I just came from the direction of the Creation Pillar!"</p><p></p><p>Oh?</p><p></p><p>Lu Changsheng's eyes flickered with surprise, and he loosened his grip, letting the Reincarnation Demon Child down.</p><p></p><p>"Cough cough cough cough."</p><p></p><p>The Reincarnation Demon Child, freed from the grip, bent over coughing violently.</p><p></p><p>Lu Changsheng looked at the Reincarnation Demon Child for a while. "The Creation Pillar is so far away, you seem to have some abilities."</p><p></p><p>The Reincarnation Demon Child seemed to have recovered a bit, then said bitterly, "Big Brother, I'm actually a native of the Creation Pillar. I was also driven out. I'm the last surviving scion of the Reincarnation Clan on the Creation Pillar."</p><p></p><p>Hunxing and the others looked at the Reincarnation Demon Child with great skepticism. </p><p></p><p>This pitiful appearance of the Reincarnation Demon Child was in stark contrast to his previous ruthless and destructive ways.</p><p></p><p>But Lu Changsheng didn't care about that. His thoughts were focused on the Creation Pillar, so he asked directly, "Driven out by whom?"</p><p></p><p>Hearing this, an expression of boundless resentment appeared on the Reincarnation Demon Child's face, and he growled:</p><p></p><p>"By endless, unimaginably powerful monsters! They have occupied the Creation Pillar, slaughtering and enslaving the native inhabitants!!!"</p><p></p><p>"As the last bloodline of the Reincarnation Clan, when I grow stronger, I will definitely go back and kill them, kill them all!!"</p><p></p><p>He had devoured many worlds, of course, to strengthen himself so he could go back and take revenge. The Reincarnation Clan was a superior race, possessing the monstrous talent of growing stronger by devouring.</p><p></p><p>But those monsters were truly too powerful, too strong! They even wiped out the Reincarnation Clan, which was so difficult to kill.</p><p></p><p>Lu Changsheng's eyes flickered slightly. With this, it made sense why he had coincidentally encountered the Reincarnation Demon Child when he descended with just a wisp of his true self.</p><p></p><p>Well, well, so he was just a stray dog, and happened to run into him.</p><p></p><p>On the side, Hunxing and the others felt a chill in their hearts!</p><p></p><p>What kind of monster could be endless and unimaginably powerful?</p><p></p><p>Even the Reincarnation Demon Child evaluated them as supremely strong?</p><p></p><p>Young man, aren't you exaggerating a bit?</p><p></p><p>But looking at the Reincarnation Demon Child's frenzied state, it really didn't seem like a lie.</p><p></p><p>"Escaping is escaping, no need to say you were driven out, that sounds too nice." Lu Changsheng sprinkled some salt on the Reincarnation Demon Child's wound.</p><p></p><p>The Reincarnation Demon Child lowered his head in silence, not wanting to argue with this person.</p><p></p><p>Looking at the frenzied Reincarnation Demon Child, Lu Changsheng suddenly said, "Do you know who I am?"</p><p></p><p>The Reincarnation Demon Child paused, then said dejectedly, "Sir, I don't know who you are. I'm about to die anyway, what's the point of knowing this now?"</p><p></p><p>Lu Changsheng spoke softly, "I am the Lord of the Boundless Void, the Supreme of the Great Dao. All things in the world are under my dominion. This wisp of my true self has descended to this world to purge the vermin on the eight Creation Pillars."</p><p></p><p>As the words fell, everyone suddenly looked up!</p>

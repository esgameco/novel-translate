        <h1>Chapter 340</h1>
        <div class="content">
            <p>Here is the full English translation of the Chinese excerpt:</p><p></p><p>Jian Wuhui placed the tea cup down and said indifferently, "What if it's real, what if it's fake?"</p><p></p><p>Seeing Jian Wuhui's expression, Hong Yun suddenly smiled, "It doesn't matter."</p><p></p><p>Jian Wuhui looked at her and said in a deep voice, "Even if Lu Xiaoyou truly possesses the Eternal Life Body, he is still a human. When he fully matures in the future, he may bring great benefits to humanity without any harm. Perhaps... he can truly change the current state of humanity?"</p><p></p><p>Hong Yun still smiled, "The master is right."</p><p></p><p>Jian Wuhui looked at Hong Yun deeply, "Do you really think I'm right?"</p><p></p><p>"Whatever the master says is right." Hong Yun nodded.</p><p></p><p>"Hong Yun, since you address me as master, let me remind you not to have any illusions about the Eternal Life Body."</p><p></p><p>Jian Wuhui shook his head. </p><p></p><p>Outsiders all thought Hong Yun was his mount, but little did they know that Hong Yun's strength was even greater than Jian Wuhui, the Exterminator Sword Sovereign.</p><p></p><p>The fact that Hong Yun could address him as master was just an accident and a coincidence.</p><p></p><p>Their relationship was more like partners than master and servant. They had a covenant, sharing life and death!</p><p></p><p>If Hong Yun truly respected him deeply, she would not have acted so casually in front of him, apart from that one address of "master".</p><p></p><p>"Master, if the so-called Lu Xiaoyou truly possesses the Eternal Life Body, won't you be tempted?" Hong Yun asked with a flickering gaze.</p><p></p><p>"I will be tempted." Jian Wuhui answered without hesitation.</p><p></p><p>Before Hong Yun could speak, Jian Wuhui stood up, and his long sword materialized in his hand.</p><p></p><p>He held the sword horizontally in front of him with his left hand, and with his right hand, he stroked the sword's body, a hint of arrogance flashing in his eyes:</p><p></p><p>"But I, Jian Wuhui, am a sword cultivator!"</p><p></p><p>Hong Yun immediately understood the meaning behind Jian Wuhui's words, and she couldn't help but feel helpless. Indeed, this was the true Jian Wuhui, the Exterminator Sword Sovereign...</p><p></p><p>But she and Jian Wuhui shared life and death, haha...</p><p></p><p>After a moment of silence in the hall, Hong Yun shook her head lightly and disappeared as a wisp of red light.</p><p></p><p>"Clang, clang, clang, clang..."</p><p></p><p>Suddenly, the sword in Jian Wuhui's hand started to vibrate, as if it was rejoicing.</p><p></p><p>Jian Wuhui was stunned for a moment, then he couldn't help but laugh.</p><p></p><p>His sword dao had not progressed for a long time, but it had unexpectedly advanced in such an absurd manner.</p><p></p><p>The sword heart... had become clear!</p><p></p><p>...</p><p></p><p>In the human city, Lu Changsheng walked out of the room in an inn and headed downstairs.</p><p></p><p>He was planning to wander around the city, and he didn't intend to call Old Turtle and Li Shuyuan, who were currently cultivating.</p><p></p><p>Soon, Lu Changsheng left the inn and came to the bustling street. He conjured a jujube in his hand and ate it while randomly walking in a direction.</p><p></p><p>The jujube was bought from Xiaotong in the Spiritual Dust Realm, and he hadn't finished it yet.</p><p></p><p>As for the red fruit before the jujube, he had indeed finished it.</p><p></p><p>Lu Changsheng strolled leisurely on the street, just wandering aimlessly without any destination.</p><p></p><p>The various strange weapons or talismans sold by the cultivators on the roadside or in the shops held no attraction for him.</p><p></p><p>He wandered for a while, but couldn't find any stalls or shops selling snacks.</p><p></p><p>What was sold on the market was mostly related to cultivation.</p><p></p><p>Well, in the God-Demon Battlefield, the entire human race was composed of cultivators, so there were no ordinary people here...</p><p></p><p>"Good!!"</p><p></p><p>Suddenly, a faint cheer reached Lu Changsheng's ears.</p><p></p><p>Lu Changsheng raised his gaze and saw a dense crowd in the distance.</p><p></p><p>He then walked towards the crowd.</p><p></p><p>Shortly after, he arrived at the edge of the crowd. There was a huge square in front of him, and he saw two cultivators battling on a high platform. Their cultivation levels were not too weak, probably stronger than the Deity Realm.</p><p></p><p>No wonder there were so many cultivators watching here.</p><p></p><p>And beside the high platform, there was a giant stone pillar with many cultivators' names carved from top to bottom, which seemed to be a ranking.</p><p></p><p>Lu Changsheng smiled and asked a thin cultivator beside him, "Why are they fighting?"</p><p></p><p>Huh?</p><p></p><p>The thin cultivator, who had been enthusiastically watching the battle, was obviously stunned for a moment when he heard the question. Why are they fighting?</p><p></p><p>He then turned his head to look at the young cultivator beside him and pointed to the high platform, saying...</p><p></p><p>Here is the full English translation of the Chinese excerpt:</p><p></p><p>The emaciated cultivator asked with doubt, "Fellow Daoist, are you asking me?"</p><p></p><p>Lu Changsheng nodded with a smile.</p><p></p><p>Seeing this, the emaciated cultivator eyed Lu Changsheng suspiciously, "Fellow Daoist, could it be that you have come from other realms of the human race and just entered this human city?"</p><p></p><p>"Yes," Lu Changsheng responded earnestly.</p><p></p><p>"I see." The emaciated cultivator finally understood.</p><p></p><p>Otherwise, how could there be someone in the human city who doesn't know about the Battle Platform?</p><p></p><p>He then said, "Fellow Daoist, you don't know, but this is the Battle Platform, hosted by Lord Golden Wheel and Lord Cudgel Saint. Only cultivators at the Shen Xuan Realm and above can compete on the platform. Do you see that stone pillar? That is the Battle Ranking, the ranking of our human city's cultivators above the Shen Xuan Realm!"</p><p></p><p>"This Battle Platform is similar to the individual combat ranking of the myriad races. In simple terms, it is a way to motivate us. Those who can be listed on the ranking are the elites and renowned figures of our human city."</p><p></p><p>Lu Changsheng nodded slightly and asked, "And who are this Lord Golden Wheel and Lord Cudgel Saint?"</p><p></p><p>Huh?</p><p></p><p>The emaciated cultivator was truly dumbfounded this time, and he couldn't help but distance himself from Lu Changsheng, looking at him with great caution!</p><p></p><p>Not until he confirmed that Lu Changsheng was truly from the human race did his heart calm down.</p><p></p><p>However, he was now a bit displeased.</p><p></p><p>He spoke in a slightly cold tone, "Fellow Daoist, we are both from the human race, and I kindly explained this to you, yet you seem to be mocking me. Is that appropriate?"</p><p></p><p>It was simply ridiculous. If the young man in front of him didn't know about the Battle Ranking, it could be forgiven, but if he didn't know about Lord Golden Wheel and Lord Cudgel Saint, that was unacceptable!</p><p></p><p>On the Divine-Demon Battlefield, who in the human race did not know the Five Lords, the five top-tier combat powers?</p><p></p><p>The Lord of the Sky City, the Peerless Sword Venerable Jian Wuhui.</p><p>The Lord of the Earth City, the Violent King Mang Tian, and the Wind Sage Jiang Wuxin.</p><p>The Lord of the Human City, Lord Golden Wheel Han Jinlong, and Lord Cudgel Saint Yan Jueyi.</p><p></p><p>These five could be said to be the pillars of the human race, especially the Peerless Sword Venerable, who was an unparalleled figure on the individual combat ranking!</p><p></p><p>Lu Changsheng smiled and said, "Fellow Daoist, you misunderstood. I was not mocking you, but rather, I suffered some damage to my sea of consciousness during a battle with the other races, and have forgotten some things."</p><p></p><p>Sss!</p><p></p><p>The emaciated cultivator sucked in a cold breath, looking at Lu Changsheng with shock. He quickly felt ashamed and hurriedly apologized, "Fellow Daoist, I was rude just now. You don't need to take it to heart. I, Zhou Dafu, did not mean that."</p><p></p><p>Lu Changsheng looked at the emaciated cultivator strangely. This person, so thin and malnourished-looking, yet his name sounded quite grand, not quite matching his appearance.</p><p></p><p>"It's alright, we are all fellow cultivators of the human race," Lu Changsheng smiled.</p><p></p><p>Regarding the young man in front of him, Zhou Dafu felt a deep respect. To be able to fight against the other races, he must be at least at the Shen Cang Realm.</p><p></p><p>In the human race, cultivators below the Shen Cang Realm are generally not allowed to leave the human realms, unless a great war breaks out. The other races, though fewer in number, are mostly very strong.</p><p></p><p>"Fellow Daoist, Lord Golden Wheel and Lord Cudgel Saint are the peak figures of the Human City, as well as the peak figures of our human race. They are the Five Lords, along with the Violent King, the Wind Sage, and the Peerless Sword Venerable," Zhou Dafu said with reverence.</p><p></p><p>Lu Changsheng nodded slightly, indicating that he understood, then turned his gaze to the battle on the high platform.</p><p></p><p>Zhou Dafu asked in bewilderment, "Fellow Daoist, aren't you supposed to be shocked?"</p><p></p><p>Lu Changsheng's brow furrowed slightly. Should he be shocked? But he just couldn't feel that way...</p><p></p><p>It seemed that he had never truly been shocked by anything before.</p><p></p><p>"I don't feel shocked," Lu Changsheng said politely.</p><p></p><p>"Okay, alright then," Zhou Dafu nodded awkwardly.</p><p></p><p>Lu Changsheng remained silent, just quietly watching the battle, not making any comments.</p><p></p><p>But Zhou Dafu couldn't help himself and said, "Fellow Daoist, the two up there, one is Senior Kongzhen, ranked 10th on the Battle Ranking, and the other is Senior Miaofan, ranked 11th. Today, it is Senior Miaofan who has issued the challenge. What do you think, who will win?"</p><p></p><p>"What does it matter to me who wins?" Lu Changsheng said softly.</p><p></p><p>"......" Zhou Dafu was at a loss for words. This young Daoist friend of his was really skilled at killing the conversation.</p><p></p><p>He just couldn't get through to him.</p>

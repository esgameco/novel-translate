        <h1>Chapter 293</h1>
        <div class="content">
            <p>Here is the full English translation of the Chinese excerpt:</p><p></p><p>Luchang was still walking leisurely in front. üíú‚ô¢6‚ûàùïä·ïº«ó◊ê.ùî†√ò–ºüç≠‚úå</p><p></p><p>However, the gazes of Fushi, Fu, and the others behind him changed slightly!</p><p></p><p>They all had the marks of the test stones, and they had already sensed that five supreme celestial champions were chasing after them.</p><p></p><p>And they were about to catch up!</p><p></p><p>"Senior, someone is targeting us," Fushi frowned and said.</p><p></p><p>The three of them didn't seem panicked at all, after all, the senior in blue robes in front of them was a late-stage Sword Cultivator at the Divine Yang Realm!</p><p></p><p>In the secret realm, apart from the top five supreme celestial champions, there were very few who could pose a threat to the senior.</p><p></p><p>With such a powerful backer, they naturally weren't the least bit anxious.</p><p></p><p>"Let them target us, don't bother with these clowns, we'll deal with them when they get here," Luchang smiled.</p><p></p><p>At this moment, the group finally emerged from the sandstorm area and arrived in a relatively calm desert.</p><p></p><p>Luchang looked at a distant oasis, where there was even a tree, and immediately said, "Let's go sit under that tree and wait for the secret realm to end."</p><p></p><p>"Okay."</p><p></p><p>Moments later, the four arrived at the big tree by the oasis, just about to sit down when...</p><p></p><p>Five figures suddenly appeared in front of them!</p><p></p><p>It was Miu and his group!!</p><p></p><p>Fushi, Fu, and Liu's movements froze, and they slowly stood up, looking warily at the five people in front of them.</p><p></p><p>They had some impression of Miu, having seen him once a year ago during the test stone, a supreme celestial champion at the Divine Element Realm.</p><p></p><p>As for Luchang, he sat down unconcernedly and calmly watched Miu's group.</p><p></p><p>"Well, well, if it isn't the much-talked-about supreme celestial champion at the Immortal Emperor Realm? What a coincidence that we've run into each other?" Miu looked at the carefree Luchang, his gaze mocking and teasing.</p><p></p><p>"Don't pretend, this is no coincidence. We all have special auras, do you think we don't know you've been chasing after us?" Fushi said coldly.</p><p></p><p>"Hmm?" Miu paused, shifting his gaze to Fushi, his eyes immediately brightening as he scanned Fushi's enchanting figure from top to bottom, then grinning and flirting, "I didn't notice earlier, but it turns out there's such a beauty. Tsk tsk, I am Miu, the young master of the Miu Clan in the Royal City. May I have the honor of knowing the beautiful lady's name?"</p><p></p><p>Fushi's expression remained cold and disdainful. "Scram, you ugly beast."</p><p></p><p>Fu and Liu's faces flushed red, their mouths twitching as if they were holding back laughter.</p><p></p><p>Miu's face, however, stiffened!</p><p></p><p>Then it darkened completely, and he waved his hand, saying, "Kill them all, but leave that woman for me to deal with!!"</p><p></p><p>At Miu's words, the four behind him grew grim-faced and slowly approached Luchang's group.</p><p></p><p>Fushi, Fu, and Liu's gazes immediately sharpened, but they didn't back down.</p><p></p><p>As long as Miu, at the Divine Element Realm, didn't make a move, they could still handle these four supreme celestial champions at the Immortal Ancestor Realm.</p><p></p><p>But just then, a flash of light appeared in Luchang's eyes.</p><p></p><p>The four approaching celestial champions hadn't even gotten close when they suddenly exploded into a mist of blood!</p><p></p><p>Miu was startled and abruptly retreated a step!!</p><p></p><p>Fushi, Fu, and Liu were also stunned, but they quickly regained their composure and fell silent.</p><p></p><p>"Who was it? Who was it? I am Miu, the young master of the Miu Clan in the Royal City. Who dares to interfere? Come out!" Miu looked around with a grave expression.</p><p></p><p>He wasn't overly afraid, as with his Divine Element Realm cultivation, he could also easily crush the four Immortal Ancestor Realm celestial champions.</p><p></p><p>Time ticked by, but the surroundings were silent, only the distant echoes of battles between celestial champions could be heard.</p><p></p><p>Seeing this, Miu's expression stiffened, as if he had remembered something. He quickly used the test stone to...</p><p></p><p>Here is the full English translation of the Chinese excerpt:</p><p></p><p>The stone's mark sensed the surroundings,</p><p></p><p>New 69 Book Bar ‚Üí 69shux.com</p><p></p><p>The next moment, his face turned pale.</p><p></p><p>Because in this area, there was not the slightest trace of the special aura of the test stone mark.</p><p></p><p>Only the three special auras in front of him... No, no, there were clearly four people in front of him, why were there only three auras??</p><p></p><p>A sense of eerie terror instantly permeated Miaolun's heart.</p><p></p><p>His eyes swept across the four people in front of him like a falcon, and he finally discovered with horror that the three special auras came from the three standing people, while the Immortal Emperor realm genius sitting cross-legged had no special aura at all!!</p><p></p><p>How could this be?</p><p></p><p>Was this person not marked by the test stone? How did he do it?</p><p></p><p>Miaolun's mind was in complete disarray, and his footsteps began to slowly retreat.</p><p></p><p>He recalled the scenes from the outside to this place, and suddenly found that the Immortal Emperor realm genius in front of him was very abnormal!!</p><p></p><p>That calm and unperturbed demeanor was not something an ordinary Immortal Emperor realm genius could possess.</p><p></p><p>"You... who are you?" </p><p></p><p>Miaolun stared warily at the bronze mask, retreating while asking solemnly.</p><p></p><p>A jade token appeared in his hand, and he gripped it tightly, ready to crush it at the first sign of trouble.</p><p></p><p>Lu Changsheng still sat there in silence.</p><p></p><p>This made Miaolun even more nervous, and the next moment, he suddenly turned around and wanted to retreat first!</p><p></p><p>But it was as if he had hit some kind of barrier and was violently bounced back!</p><p></p><p>He was stunned for a moment, his face finally turning deathly pale, realizing that to imprison his Spiritualist realm space, he would need to be at least at the Divine Yang realm!</p><p></p><p>He quickly turned to look at Lu Changsheng and shouted angrily, "You are not at the Immortal Emperor realm cultivation, I am the young master of the Miao Clan, just wait, I will settle this account with you when you come out!!"</p><p></p><p>After saying that, he ruthlessly crushed the jade token in his hand!</p><p></p><p>Although he was unwilling, he originally could have gotten the reward for the top 1,500 rankings, but now he had lost everything, being eliminated so early as a Spiritualist realm cultivator, he would surely be subjected to strange gazes when he went out.</p><p></p><p>"Hahaha, I hope you die in the Sand Secret Realm, otherwise when you come out, my Miao Clan will not let you off so easily!!"</p><p></p><p>As Miaolun spoke the last words, his expression suddenly froze!</p><p></p><p>Because even though he had crushed the jade token, he was still standing in the same place, without the slightest sign of being teleported away.</p><p></p><p>Sweat instantly soaked his ferocious face!</p><p></p><p>Miaolun roared in a somewhat frenzied manner, "What's going on? What's the situation?!"</p><p></p><p>Fu Shiyu and the other three looked at the obviously unhinged Miaolun and couldn't help but take a step back in trepidation.</p><p></p><p>Miaolun suddenly raised his head and stared directly at Lu Changsheng: "It's you! You're the one who's up to no good, aren't you?!"</p><p></p><p>But the next moment, Miaolun knelt down and begged, "Senior, spare me! After I get out, Miaolun will serve you well with the best food and drink!"</p><p></p><p>Lu Changsheng sighed and with a thought, erased Miaolun, actually not wanting to bother with this kind of junior, but to avoid trouble, it was better to just kill him.</p><p></p><p>The space here finally became a little quieter.</p><p></p><p>"What are you all standing there for, sit down and rest."</p><p></p><p>Lu Changsheng said softly.</p><p></p><p>"Yes... yes."</p><p></p><p>Fu Shiyu was mentally prepared, but Fu Tao and Liu Xing's voices were a bit trembling.</p><p></p><p>The mysterious aura of the senior in green had risen to a new level in their hearts.</p><p></p><p>Even Miaolun, a supreme genius of a great clan, who was absolutely one of the top in the Spiritualist realm, was simply erased.</p><p></p><p>They didn't even see the senior in green use any moves.</p><p></p><p>Fu Tao and Liu Xing were thinking, could the Divine Yang realm really be so terrifyingly powerful?</p>

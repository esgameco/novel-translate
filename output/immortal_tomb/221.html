            <p>Here is the full English translation of the Chinese excerpt:</p><p></p><p>Luyue was now extremely shocked. üç≠üíò‚ùªÔºô—ï–Ω‚ìä·ô≠.ùêú·µí–ºüêíüç©</p><p></p><p>He suddenly looked towards Leireng Dong and Li Tailing by his side!</p><p></p><p>Sure enough, he saw that the two of them were acting very unnaturally, and he could even vaguely see a sense of terror!</p><p></p><p>Could it be that the three people mentioned by Lu Changsheng, other than Wei Dianzhong, were actually Leireng Dong and Li Tailing??</p><p></p><p>After all, apart from these two, there was no one else who fit the description.</p><p></p><p>Luyue was quite certain that he had never seen Lu Changsheng before, let alone having any enmity with him, so he first excluded himself.</p><p></p><p>But... why did Leireng Dong and the others have enmity with Lu Changsheng? Why didn't he know about it?</p><p></p><p>What exactly happened in the past...</p><p></p><p>Luyue was now completely puzzled.</p><p></p><p>"Lu Changsheng, on what grounds did you tell the Patriarch?" The old man's illusory figure said in a deep voice, his eyes flickering.</p><p></p><p>Wei Shengian knew that Lu Changsheng was very strong, extremely strong!!!</p><p></p><p>With just them, they couldn't possibly defeat him!</p><p></p><p>There was absolutely no chance of survival!!</p><p></p><p>It was precisely because of this that he couldn't bear to tell Lu Changsheng, so that he could perhaps delay Lu Changsheng for a while...</p><p></p><p>To give his true self, who was far away in the Heavenly Realm, more time to flee from Linglang Heaven!!!</p><p></p><p>Lu Changsheng's eyes turned slightly cold as he said softly, "Do you think I don't know what you're thinking? Your true self won't be able to escape."</p><p></p><p>Wei Shengian's illusory figure's eyes trembled!</p><p></p><p>"If you don't say it, then let him say it."</p><p></p><p>Lu Changsheng said indifferently, and then suddenly reached out and grabbed Leireng Dong!</p><p></p><p>Leireng Dong's scalp suddenly went numb!!</p><p></p><p>The immortal qi that had been ready to erupt within him the moment he saw Lu Changsheng suddenly burst out violently!!</p><p></p><p>Countless arcs of electricity suddenly exploded all over his body, illuminating the entire area!!</p><p></p><p>Rumbling!!!!!</p><p></p><p>At this moment, the originally calm sky was suddenly filled with dark clouds and rolling thunder, countless times more violent than the previous display by Zhong Wuyan and the others!!</p><p></p><p>Seeing the endless thunder, everyone was trembling in their hearts.</p><p></p><p>The Patriarch of the Great Day Thunder Sect was so strong!!</p><p></p><p>They couldn't even imagine how terrifying the attack Leireng Dong was about to unleash would be!!</p><p></p><p>"Leave."</p><p></p><p>At this moment, Lu Changsheng indifferently uttered a single word.</p><p></p><p>The endless thunder instantly 'whooshed' away, and in the blink of an eye, the sky became clear and bright.</p><p></p><p>"......"</p><p></p><p>Everyone's eyes were wide open, unable to believe what they had just witnessed.</p><p></p><p>What, what was going on?!</p><p></p><p>The crowd quickly looked towards Lu Changsheng, their eyes filled with fear and disbelief!!</p><p></p><p>Soon, they quickly averted their gaze, not daring to look any further.</p><p></p><p>Luyue took a deep breath, and the look in his eyes towards Lu Changsheng finally turned to terror.</p><p></p><p>Just what kind of existence were the Thunder Sect Patriarch and the others at enmity with...</p><p></p><p>As for Leireng Dong, his aura immediately dissipated, and he was plunged into deep despair!</p><p></p><p>The thunder that he was so proud of was completely useless against this monster called Lu Changsheng!</p><p></p><p>Even the Dao of Linglang Heaven seemed to fear Lu Changsheng!</p><p></p><p>The next moment, he was suddenly grabbed by an invisible force and dragged towards Lu Changsheng!!</p><p></p><p>He was completely panicked, his face pale as he roared, "Patriarch Wei, Elder Li, quickly help me!! If the others are also drawn out by Lu Changsheng, he will immediately act without any restraint towards you!"</p><p></p><p>Upon hearing this, Wei Shengian and Li Tailing fell silent.</p><p></p><p>At this time, the members of the Great Day Thunder Sect were also in a state of panic and confusion.</p><p></p><p>From the moment the Patriarch of the Carefree Sect appeared, everything had changed!</p><p></p><p>Leiyu and Leiting were even more shaken, their minds in a haze.</p><p></p><p>Even now, they could hardly regain their composure.</p><p></p><p>Apart from the battle that exceeded their level, their father actually had other enmity with the Patriarch of the Carefree Sect.</p><p></p><p>And it was clear that...</p><p></p><p>Here is the full English translation of the Chinese novel excerpt:</p><p></p><p>A Deadly Grudge!</p><p></p><p>[New 69 Book Bar]</p><p></p><p>"Senior! Senior!!" </p><p></p><p>Lei Yu suddenly knelt down, tears streaming down his face, pleading, "Please, Senior, have mercy!!"</p><p></p><p>Lei Ting also knelt down, her expression one of deep sorrow.</p><p></p><p>This scene caused countless people to tremble.</p><p></p><p>They had never seen the mighty Overlord of the Human Realm, the Great Sun Thunder Sect, in such a disheveled state.</p><p></p><p>However, Lei Cheng-dong was stunned. His expression turned horrific as he roared at Lei Yu and Lei Ting, "Get up, who told you to kneel?!"</p><p></p><p>He knew that no matter what, the Great Sun Thunder Sect would not escape destruction today. </p><p></p><p>Since they were doomed to perish, why beg for mercy from Lu Changsheng? No, he absolutely could not do that!</p><p></p><p>"You two, get up!!" Lei Cheng-dong even became hysterical, the aura of the Sect Master completely vanishing in this moment, provoked by Lei Yu and Lei Ting.</p><p></p><p>But Lei Yu, as if he did not hear, choked out, "Father... Father, you will die!"</p><p></p><p>Lei Cheng-dong paused, no longer speaking, only casting a guilty look at Lei Yu, Lei Ting, and all the disciples of the Great Sun Thunder Sect.</p><p></p><p>Yes, what right did he have to scold and blame them, when it was all his own grave mistake?</p><p></p><p>The next moment, Lei Cheng-dong was brought before Lu Changsheng!!</p><p></p><p>Facing Lu Changsheng at such close range, he trembled all over, not daring to meet his gaze, and finally lowered his head, unable to suppress his shaking as he asked, "Senior Lu... can you..."</p><p></p><p>But Lu Changsheng suddenly pointed a finger at his forehead!!</p><p></p><p>"Ahhh!!"</p><p></p><p>Lei Cheng-dong let out a sudden, agonized scream!</p><p></p><p>In his heart, Lei Cheng-dong was terrified. This was not a simple soul search - Lu Changsheng wanted to completely shatter his mind!</p><p></p><p>Lu Changsheng not only wanted to kill him, but to torture him as well!</p><p></p><p>Seeing the Great Sun Thunder Sect Master in such a pitiful state, the fear of the onlookers multiplied, their very souls trembling.</p><p></p><p>"No! Don't!!" Lei Yu's pupils contracted to pinpoints as he suddenly rushed towards Lu Changsheng, "Senior, don't!!"</p><p></p><p>The crowd was startled, and Peng Fangzheng was about to intervene.</p><p></p><p>But at this moment, Lu Changsheng turned his head and glanced at Lei Yu, and Lei Yu was frozen in midair, unable to move, only able to stare wide-eyed at Lei Cheng-dong's agonizing state.</p><p></p><p>"Ah, ah, ah, Thunder Ancestor! Thunder Ancestor, save me!!!" Lei Cheng-dong wailed in agony.</p><p></p><p>At the same time, </p><p></p><p>in the Thunder Ancestor Hall of the Great Sun Thunder Sect, the eyes of the Thunder Ancestor statue, which had been closed, suddenly snapped open!!</p><p></p><p>With a rumble, it abruptly shot up, bursting through the Thunder Ancestor Hall, towering thousands of feet tall, standing between heaven and earth!</p><p></p><p>This colossal statue was seen even by the countless people in the Sunset Thunder Forest, who were left dumbfounded!</p><p></p><p>What was this?!</p><p></p><p>Only the many elders of the Great Sun Thunder Sect were overjoyed - it was the Thunder Ancestor statue!</p><p></p><p>"Thunder, come," the Thunder Ancestor statue spoke, its ancient and solemn voice resounding.</p><p></p><p>But moments later...</p><p></p><p>The sky remained clear and cloudless, with no sign of any thunder.</p><p></p><p>"Hm?" The Thunder Ancestor statue was puzzled.</p><p></p><p>It then repeated, "Thunder, come!"</p><p></p><p>The sky remained bright and tranquil.</p><p></p><p>The Thunder Ancestor statue: "..."</p><p></p><p>The Great Sun Thunder Sect elders, recalling the scene of Lu Changsheng repelling the Sect Master's lightning, had throats so dry they could barely swallow, could it be that...</p><p></p><p>Just then,</p><p></p><p>Lu Changsheng suddenly threw a fist through the air!</p><p></p><p>Boom!!!</p><p></p><p>The towering statue thousands of feet tall crumbled and collapsed!</p><p></p><p>Immediately after, Lu Changsheng slapped the already moribund Lei Cheng-dong, reducing him to nothingness.</p><p></p><p>Before the crowd could recover their senses,</p><p></p><p>Lu Changsheng looked at the dumbfounded Wei ShengtiƒÅn, and a ancient longsword appeared in his hand, which he then abruptly flung into the void!!</p><p></p><p>Accompanied by a resounding sword cry, the longsword cleaved through the void and vanished.</p><p></p><p>"Let's see whose sword is faster, or if your true body can escape in time..."</p>

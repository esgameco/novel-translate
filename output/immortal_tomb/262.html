        <h1>Chapter 262</h1>
        <div class="content">
            <p>Here is the full English translation of the Chinese excerpt:</p><p></p><p>"Then you should just go die. ‚ñÄ‚ñÑ‚ñÄ‚ñÑ‚ñÄ‚ñÑ ‚ûÖÔºôùî∞ ∞‡∏¢x.ùïîùêéœª ‚ñÑ‚ñÄ‚ñÑ‚ñÄ‚ñÑ‚ñÄ"</p><p></p><p>As the words fell, all the faces changed drastically!</p><p></p><p>The vast illusory shadows were suddenly shaking violently.</p><p></p><p>He had thought that Lu Changsheng, after much consideration, would be intimidated and retreat, but he never expected Lu Changsheng to be so domineering and forceful!</p><p></p><p>Doesn't he fear the pursuit of the Heavenly Dao? Doesn't he disregard the lives of all beings in this realm?!</p><p></p><p>How dare Lu Changsheng!</p><p></p><p>The aura of the incarnation of the Heavenly Dao was slightly disrupted, but he could not retreat!</p><p></p><p>This was his home turf, he was the source of the Ancestral Celestial Realm, who could defeat him here!</p><p></p><p>He did not have much confidence in defeating Lu Changsheng, but Lu Changsheng also couldn't hope to win against him in the Ancestral Celestial Realm!</p><p></p><p>His tone then turned icy, "Lu Changsheng, if you fight me, the entire Ancestral Celestial Realm will be affected, are you sure?"</p><p></p><p>"Affected?"</p><p></p><p>A chill rose in Lu Changsheng's heart, and he mocked, "You're giving yourself too much credit."</p><p></p><p>With that,</p><p></p><p>Brilliant blue light burst forth from Lu Changsheng's eyes!</p><p></p><p>The Great Dao Eye suddenly began to revolve!</p><p></p><p>Boom! Boom! Boom! Boom! Boom...!</p><p></p><p>The extremely rapid sound like the pounding of a drum suddenly exploded in the heavens and earth!!</p><p></p><p>"Poof!!!"</p><p></p><p>At that moment, all the people in the venue, including Yin Yao, suddenly coughed up mouthfuls of fresh blood!!</p><p></p><p>Their faces were deathly pale, filled with terror!!</p><p></p><p>The extremely rapid Great Dao sound in the heavens and earth seemed to be exploding in their minds, stirring up towering waves one after another!</p><p></p><p>"Ahhh!!!!"</p><p></p><p>All the people let out agonizing screams, clutching their heads and collapsing to the ground, their bodies and even their souls convulsing, their eyes rolling back and blood foaming at the mouth!</p><p></p><p>This was just the unavoidable ripple effect on the crowd, one can only imagine the experience of the incarnation of the Heavenly Dao at the forefront!</p><p></p><p>"Ahhh!!! Lu Changsheng!!!"</p><p></p><p>The Heavenly Dao's agonizing howl also resounded!</p><p></p><p>As the source of the Ancestral Celestial Realm, his howl of pain reverberated throughout the entire Ancestral Celestial Realm!!</p><p></p><p>The six great divine states, the Abyss of Seclusion, the Endless Demonic Abyss... everywhere, the skies were shrouded in ominous clouds, and that eerie wail accompanied by the infernal thunder madly descended from the nine heavens!!</p><p></p><p>Countless demonic heads, countless great demons, countless beings, all looked up at the sky in trepidation, facing this unprecedented phenomenon!</p><p></p><p>Their bones were chilled to the core!</p><p></p><p>What happened to the Ancestral Celestial Realm?</p><p></p><p>...</p><p></p><p>Yunyu Town.</p><p></p><p>The mountains shook, the beasts fled, the heavens and earth seemed to be twisting in the tremors!</p><p></p><p>The once peaceful little town had descended into chaos.</p><p></p><p>Some townspeople still seeking pleasure in the Spring Fragrance Pavilion were startled and immediately fled in panic, scattering in all directions.</p><p></p><p>The streets were filled with various cries of alarm:</p><p></p><p>"What, what's happening!"</p><p>"Celestial anomaly! Celestial anomaly! The end of the world is coming! The end of the world is coming!"</p><p>"..."</p><p></p><p>At this moment, Tongxin suddenly appeared in the sky above the town, his face pale and trembling as he looked at the apocalyptic scene, and he roared,</p><p></p><p>"All townspeople, return home, close the doors and windows, and do not go out!!"</p><p></p><p>Hearing this, all the panicked townspeople looked up at the black dot in the sky, and from the voice, they all recognized who it was.</p><p></p><p>"It's Tongxin!"</p><p>"Quickly, everyone, maintain order, listen to Tongxin, go back home first!"</p><p>"Tongxin can actually fly? Isn't that amazing, since Luchang is a cultivator, Tongxin must be one too, no big deal."</p><p></p><p>Quickly, the streets were empty, and all the townspeople returned to their homes, tightly closing the doors and windows, huddling in their blankets and shivering.</p><p></p><p>"Ah!! Lu Changsheng!!"</p><p></p><p>Here is the full English translation of the Chinese excerpt:</p><p></p><p>At this moment, a piercing cry of pain suddenly erupted in the sky, vanishing in an instant!</p><p></p><p>The villagers and Tong Xin were stunned for a moment.</p><p></p><p>What immortality?</p><p></p><p>.........</p><p></p><p>In the Crimson Celestial Realm, on the Snowy Mountain.</p><p></p><p>Under the rapid vibrations of the Great Dao's voice,</p><p></p><p>The incarnation of the Heavenly Dao was clutching its head in agony, beginning to disintegrate like scattered stars!</p><p></p><p>"Lu Changsheng, if you kill me, be prepared to face the pursuit of countless Heavenly Dao!"</p><p></p><p>The incarnation of the Heavenly Dao was now terrified beyond measure. In front of Lu Changsheng, it didn't even have a chance to strike!</p><p></p><p>As the incarnation of the Heavenly Dao was disintegrating,</p><p></p><p>The blue light in Lu Changsheng's eyes dissipated, and the Great Dao's voice abruptly stopped!</p><p></p><p>In the Tianyin Temple venue, all the people were collapsed on the ground, with some even having already fainted.</p><p></p><p>Suddenly,</p><p></p><p>Lu Changsheng stretched out his hand and grasped towards the void!</p><p></p><p>"I said you must die, so you will die. Your origin... there's no escape!"</p><p></p><p>Boom!!</p><p></p><p>A gigantic hand broke through the void, reaching a certain place in the Ancestral Celestial Realm at an unparalleled speed!!</p><p></p><p>There, a hazy and brilliant light was floating!</p><p></p><p>The origin of the Heavenly Dao!</p><p></p><p>Seeing the giant hand approaching, the origin trembled and tried to flee by breaking through the void.</p><p></p><p>But how could it be faster than Lu Changsheng!</p><p></p><p>In just a moment, the origin was firmly grasped by the giant hand, unable to break free.</p><p></p><p>"Lu Changsheng!! What are you going to do!!!"</p><p></p><p>"If you destroy the origin, the Ancestral Celestial Realm will inevitably collapse, and countless lives will perish, and the Soul Realm will descend into chaos! How dare you!"</p><p></p><p>The Heavenly Dao finally panicked!</p><p></p><p>It was really just concerned about its reputation and suffering.</p><p></p><p>If it had known this would happen, it should have just let Lu Changsheng kill Zhang Shengxu smoothly.</p><p></p><p>If it had pretended not to see it at the time, things wouldn't have come to this point!</p><p></p><p>It deeply regretted it!</p><p></p><p>.........</p><p></p><p>In the Tianyin Temple venue,</p><p></p><p>The crowd was already scared out of their wits, the collapse of the Ancestral Celestial Realm... too serious. Today's sudden change, everyone felt as if they were in a dream.</p><p></p><p>Old Turtle and the four of Chu Lingian were stunned!</p><p></p><p>What did they hear?</p><p></p><p>The Soul Realm??</p><p></p><p>The souls of the living and dead in the Ancestral Celestial Realm are all managed by the Soul Realm???</p><p></p><p>Is the Soul Realm and the Soul Sovereign that powerful?</p><p></p><p>The four of Chu Lingian were even more shaken in their hearts. After all, they had only heard about the Soul Sovereign from Lu Changsheng and Old Turtle.</p><p></p><p>Except for that time when the Yin-Yang Demon Tribe invaded, they really hadn't had much contact with the Soul Sovereign.</p><p></p><p>Unexpectedly...</p><p></p><p>Ancient Yinyang and Shi Wushi had expressions of both surprise and confusion.</p><p></p><p>If the Soul Sovereign is so powerful, then why did it seem not so strong when defending against the Yin-Yang Demon Tribe at the South Immortal Realm boundary last time?</p><p></p><p>Could it be that it was constrained.</p><p></p><p>As for Old Turtle, he was a little guilty. It seems that he will have to be more cautious when dealing with the Soul Sovereign in the future.</p><p></p><p>Perhaps the Soul Sovereign had been polite to him before just because of the master's face.</p><p></p><p>......</p><p></p><p>In the void,</p><p></p><p>Lu Changsheng's illusory giant hand firmly grasped the brilliant origin.</p><p></p><p>He said expressionlessly, "Regretful?"</p><p></p><p>"But there are many things in the world... once done, they are done..."</p><p></p><p>"I won't allow you to regret!"</p><p></p><p>As soon as the words fell, he no longer gave the Heavenly Dao a chance to speak, and ruthlessly crushed the origin without hesitation!!!</p><p></p><p>Crack, boom!!</p><p></p><p>The Heavenly Dao of the Ancestral Celestial Realm was completely annihilated at this moment!!!</p><p></p><p>Rumble‚Äî‚Äî!</p><p></p><p>Immediately afterwards,</p><p></p><p>The spatial dimensions of the entire world began to shake!</p><p></p><p>Countless cracks appeared in the world!</p><p></p><p>Crack, crack, crack...</p><p></p><p>Like a shattered mirror, the spatial dimensions of the heavens and earth cracked, and the countless fragments fell down like a torrential rain.</p><p></p><p>The Ancestral Celestial Realm began to collapse.</p><p></p><p>From the moment the origin was shattered,</p><p></p><p>The apocalypse, it seems, has truly arrived!</p>

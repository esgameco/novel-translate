        <h1>Chapter 34</h1>
        <div class="content">
            <p>Here is the full English translation of the Chinese excerpt:</p><p></p><p>The young disciples stood stiffly, not daring to utter a word. üêç‚ô†‚ùª‚ûà‚ìàùêáœÖ◊ê.‚ìíÔºØ–ºüçìüë∫</p><p></p><p>Although they didn't know what had happened, they could see it.</p><p></p><p>The sect leader had clearly been reprimanded.</p><p></p><p>"Let's go," Shen Miaojun sighed.</p><p></p><p>"Yes." Gu Helin felt relieved, then turned to Tongxin and commanded, "Spirit boat!"</p><p></p><p>"Ah, oh." </p><p></p><p>Tongxin blankly tossed the mini spirit boat he was holding, and it grew larger and larger during the throw, soon revealing the actual spirit boat.</p><p></p><p>Shen Miaojun and the Second Elder boarded.</p><p></p><p>Gu Helin looked at the puzzled disciples and said, "No need to ask more, all of you get on the spirit boat."</p><p></p><p>Moments later, the spirit boat rose into the air and swiftly shot towards the horizon in a flash of light.</p><p></p><p>Soon after the spirit boat disappeared,</p><p></p><p>the night sky above Moyu Town grew increasingly dark...</p><p></p><p>At the same time,</p><p></p><p>at the rear of the spirit boat,</p><p></p><p>Shen Miaojun and Gu Helin squinted as they looked at the demonic qi spreading in the sky above Moyu Town.</p><p></p><p>"It was indeed a ploy to lure the tiger out of the mountain," the Second Elder shook his head and sighed.</p><p></p><p>Gu Helin smiled and said, "Sect Leader, Second Elder, you can rest assured. With the senior there, there is no place safer than Moyu Town."</p><p></p><p>The Second Elder nodded slightly, neither agreeing nor disagreeing.</p><p></p><p>Shen Miaojun thought of the domineering yet ethereal young man, lowered her head and sighed softly,</p><p></p><p>"Yes, with that Transcendent Cultivator senior there, there is no place safer than Moyu Town."</p><p></p><p>Transcendent Cultivator?! </p><p></p><p>Gu Helin and the Second Elder's pupils suddenly constricted!</p><p></p><p>Even though Gu Helin had previously vaguely guessed that Lu Changsheng was a Transcendent Cultivator, after receiving the confirmation from the Sect Leader who was at the late Core Formation stage, he was deeply shaken.</p><p></p><p>Shen Miaojun turned around and looked at the shaken pair, her vermilion lips parting,</p><p></p><p>"The ability to teleport is at least at the Transcendent Cultivator realm, and the vast pressure the senior has released towards our sect... our sect is certain."</p><p></p><p>...</p><p></p><p>In Moyu Town.</p><p></p><p>The night had fallen, and snoring sounds could be heard everywhere.</p><p></p><p>The patrolling town guards and soldiers somehow felt the weather had suddenly become much colder.</p><p></p><p>"This damn weather, it just suddenly turned cold. As soon as this shift is over, let's hurry back to the tent and sleep."</p><p></p><p>"Hey, don't you feel there's something strange about the weather change? What if it's demons again..."</p><p></p><p>"You're overthinking it, we have a Transcendent Cultivator in the town, what demon would dare to cause trouble here?"</p><p></p><p>"Hehe, I was just joking... How about a kiss?"</p><p></p><p>"Cut it out, it's still on duty now, we'll continue later back in the tent..."</p><p></p><p>"Hehe, okay."</p><p></p><p>Towards the end, the two burly soldiers glanced at the group of soldiers in front of them and exchanged mischievous looks while whispering.</p><p></p><p>Fluttering...</p><p></p><p>The light wind blew, causing the dozens of flags on the town walls to sway.</p><p></p><p>Wisps of black mist drifted in from the distant forest, slowly enveloping the campsite, many of them silently seeping into the tents...</p><p></p><p>In the backyard of the Town Lord's residence.</p><p></p><p>Lu Changsheng sighed lightly, "Little demons are still little demons, always sneaking around at night."</p><p></p><p>Recalling the unruly demons in the Four Directions Immortal Realm, they were nothing like these stealthy ones.</p><p></p><p>Lu Changsheng looked at the Abyss Demon Spear, and said mysteriously, "These little demons should be able to sense your demonic qi."</p><p></p><p>Seeing the young man's gaze suddenly fall on it, the Abyss Demon Spear trembled slightly, then swayed, indicating that Lu Changsheng was right.</p><p></p><p>Lu Changsheng smiled, "Then release a bit more demonic qi to lure the leader of those little demons over."</p><p></p><p>The Abyss Demon Spear looked at the young man in the green robe, always feeling that his gentle smile was rather chilling...</p><p></p><p>Here is the full English translation of the Chinese excerpt:</p><p></p><p>Outside the town of Moyu, some of the sleeping civilians in the tents had distorted, agonized expressions on their faces, their limbs convulsing, as if they were trying to wake up, but... they just couldn't open their eyes.</p><p></p><p>A dream.</p><p></p><p>In front of their eyes, it seemed to be the endless riverbank, but they couldn't see the color of the water clearly, and the entire world was unusually blurry and deathly silent.</p><p></p><p>Only the continuous sound of the flowing water echoed in their ears...</p><p></p><p>Whooshing... whooshing...</p><p></p><p>Their inner hearts began to grow restless, only wanting to run, to keep running.</p><p></p><p>But no matter how they tried, they couldn't escape, the river was still the same river, the world remained deathly silent, and aside from the river, they couldn't see anything clearly, yet the sound of the rushing water in their ears grew even more violent!</p><p></p><p>They finally fell into despair, a great fear welling up...suppressed to the extreme...</p><p></p><p>"Let, let me out!!" In the dream, the people huddled on the ground, howling in despair, like enraged beasts on the verge of collapse.</p><p></p><p>"Hehe hehe~"</p><p></p><p>A strange dark shadow appeared before the people, letting out a sinister, smug laugh.</p><p></p><p>"Ghost, ghost!" A numbing sensation filled the people's minds, infinite fear enveloping them.</p><p></p><p>"Hehe, ghost? Oh no no no, we are the Nightmare Demons..." the dark shadow chuckled ominously.</p><p></p><p>"Nightmare Demons... what is that..." The people's heads throbbed with pain, as they gritted their teeth and cried out.</p><p></p><p>"It's... it's invading your dreams, and then making you become fearful, and we'll devour the dreams filled with your terror... Mmm, just thinking about it makes my mouth water..."</p><p></p><p>The dark shadow hugged itself, cackling maniacally, as if in the throes of an addiction.</p><p></p><p>"Demons, you are demons!"</p><p></p><p>"Hehe hehe, ah yes, that's right, the more fearful you are, the more delicious this dream becomes, come, continue..."</p><p></p><p>"Ahhh!!!!"</p><p></p><p>But in the dreams of many other sleeping civilians, the situation was different...</p><p></p><p>When the Nightmare Demon tribe entered the dreams, they were perplexed.</p><p></p><p>There was a transparent barrier in front of them, blocking their way.</p><p></p><p>They could only watch through the barrier as the civilians dreamed pleasant dreams.</p><p></p><p>They couldn't stand seeing this, they wanted to see fear! The fear of the people!!</p><p></p><p>Subsequently, they frantically clawed and raged outside the barrier, trying to break through this strange barrier, but no matter how they tried, not even a ripple appeared on the barrier...</p><p></p><p>"What is this barrier? Could it be that some cultivator is meddling?"</p><p></p><p>Many Nightmare Demons quickly regained their composure and prepared to escape the dream realm to report to their tribal leader!</p><p></p><p>But then... they were horrified to discover that not only could they not interfere with the dreams, they were also unable to escape the dream realm!</p><p></p><p>It was as if they were trapped in a small cage!</p><p></p><p>At that moment!</p><p></p><p>In all the dreams, the small space confining the Nightmare Demons, simultaneously flashed with a dazzling light!</p><p></p><p>This was an ultimate brightness that the Nightmare Demons, who abhorred daylight, had no time to be frightened before they all vanished into nothingness.</p><p></p><p>And the civilians, under this mysterious protection, continued to dream pleasant dreams.</p><p></p><p>However, those without the barrier to block the Nightmare Demons were killed in their dreams.</p><p></p><p>In the backyard of the Zhenmain's mansion,</p><p></p><p>Fruit after fruit was tossed into Luchengsheng's mouth, his pupils flickering with a faint blue glow in the darkness...</p><p></p><p>This was his Dao Eye, which could see the cycle of reincarnation, life and death, and the emptiness of the world.</p><p></p><p>Among these civilians, some had committed grave sins in their previous lives, and naturally, he had no intention of saving them.</p><p></p><p>"It seems I'll have to go to the Soul Realm soon, I wonder what that fellow Hunhui has been up to, letting so many sinful people reincarnate as humans again."</p>

        <h1>Chapter 273</h1>
        <div class="content">
            <p>Here is the full English translation of the Chinese excerpt:</p><p></p><p>The swift boat flew and soared,</p><p></p><p>Among the twinkling stars ahead, the largest one shone dazzlingly, blinding everyone's eyes. üêäüëë‚ùª‚ûàùï§ÂçÑœÖ‰πÇ.ùî†ùìû‚ìú‚ô£‚ô°</p><p></p><p>A hint of excitement appeared in Fu Shiyu's eyes, and her slender finger pointed towards it. "Senior, the largest star ahead is our Yongzhou Great Realm."</p><p></p><p>In the corner of her eye, she saw the young man in blue robes nod slightly, but with the cold bronze mask covering his face, his expression was impossible to see.</p><p></p><p>Li Shuyan looked at the ever-growing star, his gaze filled with awe.</p><p></p><p>How vast must the world within it be?</p><p></p><p>For some reason, the closer they got to the large star, the faster the boat went, faster and faster!</p><p></p><p>The light grew more and more dazzling, almost blinding their eyes.</p><p></p><p>"Everyone, hold onto the railing and steady yourselves! We're about to return!"</p><p></p><p>At this moment, Fu Tao, who had already come into the cabin, shouted gravely towards the outside.</p><p></p><p>Immediately, he quickly pressed a button beside him, instantly activating a restrictive formation on the boat!</p><p></p><p>"Hum hum hum!"</p><p></p><p>Accompanied by a strange vibration, a light barrier formed around the boat.</p><p></p><p>In the Yongzhou Great Realm, all boats entering and leaving the realm had such a restrictive formation.</p><p>Its purpose was to withstand the crushing force and tension when entering and exiting the Yongzhou Great Realm.</p><p></p><p>Boom!</p><p></p><p>Finally, the boat tilted violently and plummeted into the Yongzhou Great Realm like a falling meteor!</p><p></p><p>"Rumble rumble"</p><p></p><p>On the boat, the trembling was terrifyingly severe.</p><p>Many exclamations and gasps could be heard.</p><p></p><p>Except for Lu Changsheng, Fu Shiyu and the others all had pale faces, gripping the railing tightly.</p><p>Even Li Shuyan was hugging the railing together with his Zhanxu.</p><p></p><p>Fu Shiyu's peripheral vision caught sight of the young man in blue robes still standing calmly, her gaze flickering slightly.</p><p></p><p>...</p><p></p><p>In the Yongzhou Great Realm, to the east of the Ancient Ruins, was Jingyu City.</p><p></p><p>At this time, in the Fu Clan, the Fu Clan Leader was discussing matters with a group of elders.</p><p></p><p>Suddenly, Fu Liancai's eyes lit up, and he looked up towards the sky.</p><p></p><p>The elders were slightly startled, and someone asked, "Clan Leader, what is it?"</p><p></p><p>Fu Liancai stroked his beard and squinted his eyes, smiling contentedly, "Shiyu and Tao'er have returned."</p><p></p><p>The elders were first delighted, then a sense of doubt arose in their hearts.</p><p></p><p>So soon?</p><p></p><p>Was the Void Lotus that good?</p><p></p><p>But they had no time to dwell on it. Since Shiyu and the others had returned, it meant they had already obtained the Void Lotus.</p><p></p><p>"Let's go! Shiyu and the others should be arriving at the city outskirts soon. Elders, follow me to receive them."</p><p></p><p>Fu Liancai rose joyfully and strode out.</p><p>The elders hurriedly followed.</p><p></p><p>At the same time,</p><p>The boat carrying Lu Changsheng finally arrived at the outskirts of Jingyu City.</p><p></p><p>The next moment, the boat vanished.</p><p>And Lu Changsheng and the others found themselves standing on the ground below.</p><p></p><p>"Senior..." Fu Shiyu was about to ask Lu Changsheng something, but suddenly she paused, her gaze sharpening.</p><p></p><p>The faces of Fu Tao and the others also turned grim.</p><p></p><p>Because in front of Jingyu City, there were many figures standing there, seemingly waiting for them, eyeing them menacingly.</p><p>And on the city walls, there were countless figures, as if they had come to watch the show.</p><p></p><p>"Shiyu, you all are quite fast, much more efficient than our two clans' previous Void Lotus harvesting efforts." A young man in elegant robes smiled, his gaze towards Fu Shiyu carrying a hint of tenderness.</p><p></p><p>"Haha, Ouyang brother speaks truly. Shiyu, a mere woman, has surpassed us by so much." Another slender man echoed.</p><p></p><p>Here is the full English translation of the Chinese excerpt:</p><p></p><p>Behind the two, there were many servants from their respective clans standing, each serving their own camp.</p><p></p><p>Fu Shiyu took a step forward, his eyelids slightly lowered, and said in a solemn voice, "Ouyang Jun, Liu Xing, what is the meaning of this? Surely you two are not here specifically to welcome me?"</p><p></p><p>At this time, Ouyang Jun and Liu Xing also noticed Fu Shiyu's entourage, Lu Changsheng and Li Shuyuan.</p><p></p><p>The two couldn't help but furrow their brows, a flash of confusion in their hearts.</p><p></p><p>Who are these two?</p><p></p><p>Clearly, they are not from the Fu Clan.</p><p></p><p>However, they had no time to ponder further, shifting their gaze away. Ouyang Jun cupped his hands and smiled, "Shiyu, don't overthink it. We're just here to welcome you. And if possible, Liu Xing and I would like to purchase a Void Mushroom from you at a high price. How about it?"</p><p></p><p>On Fu Shiyu's side, a commotion immediately arose.</p><p></p><p>They knew the Ouyang and Liu families had ulterior motives!</p><p></p><p>Not only did they fail to harvest the Void Mushroom this time, but even if they had, there was no way they would sell it!</p><p></p><p>Fu Shiyu's expression remained impassive as he said, "I'm sorry, but the Void Mushrooms are barely enough for our Fu Clan, so we won't be selling any to you two."</p><p></p><p>Hearing this, Fu Tao and the others were puzzled. If they hadn't harvested any, why not just say so directly instead of turning them away?</p><p></p><p>But Fu Shiyu's thinking was different. Even if they returned empty-handed, he had to claim they had harvested the Void Mushrooms in order to preserve the Fu Clan's face when confronting the Ouyang and Liu families.</p><p></p><p>Liu Xing's expression darkened, "Fu Shiyu, all we want is one mushroom each, not many. The Fu Clan's status among the three great clans in Jingxun City is teetering on the brink, and many other families are preparing to take your place. Everyone in the city knows this. What you should do now is obediently hand over the Void Mushrooms to us instead of opposing us. Don't be shameless!"</p><p></p><p>Ouyang Jun opened his mouth but didn't say anything. Even though he had feelings for Fu Shiyu, he was not the type to indulge in romantic entanglements.</p><p></p><p>"Hahaha..." The clansmen behind the two burst into laughter, their faces filled with disdain and mockery.</p><p></p><p>The countless spectators on the city walls also became restless.</p><p></p><p>"Whew, are the Ouyang and Liu Clans really going to tear into the Fu Clan? To say such humiliating words in front of so many people."</p><p></p><p>"Ah, the Fu Clan, being one of the three great clans of Jingxun City, has long been a mere shell of its former self. Everyone knows that if it weren't for their venerable ancestor still alive, they would have been devoured by the major powers in the city long ago."</p><p></p><p>"Yes, I've heard that the Fu Clan's venerable ancestor's lifespan is nearing its end. Otherwise, the Ouyang and Liu families wouldn't be so bold and unrestrained."</p><p></p><p>"I'm afraid that the moment the Fu Clan's venerable ancestor passes away, it will also mark the end of the Fu Clan..."</p><p></p><p>Hearing this, Fu Shiyu's expression darkened, and the fists hidden in his sleeves slowly clenched.</p><p></p><p>Fu Tao and the others were even more enraged!</p><p></p><p>Liu Xing was simply too outrageous!</p><p></p><p>To publicly humiliate their Fu Clan like this, when the Fu Clan, although diminished, was still one of the three great clans!</p><p></p><p>In response, Lu Changsheng merely watched silently, his eyes behind the mask betraying no emotion.</p><p></p><p>Li Shuyuan, on the other hand, gripped his sword, his expression as wooden as ever.</p><p></p><p>But his heart was actually trembling.</p><p></p><p>No wonder this is the great world - the average cultivation and strength far surpassed the Ancestral Heavenly Realm!</p><p></p><p>Not to mention the many powerful experts here, akin to Immortal Ancestor realm, among the crowd.</p><p></p><p>And Fu Shiyu, Ouyang Jun, and Liu Xing were even more formidable, possessing cultivation close to the Immortal Ancestor realm!</p><p></p><p>And they were not even at the initial stage of the Immortal Ancestor realm...</p><p></p><p>Almost at the fifth transformation!</p>

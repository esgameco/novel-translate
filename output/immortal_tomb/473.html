        <h1>Chapter 473</h1>
        <div class="content">
            <p>Here is the full English translation of the Chinese excerpt:</p><p></p><p>During this period, the Ancient Realm of the Void was extremely stable. </p><p></p><p>Although it was time for a reshuffle, there was no friction between the various tribes, and they all fell silent.</p><p></p><p>The reason was simple - any tribe was afraid of affecting the one from the Ye Clan, fearing that even the slightest mistake would incur the wrath of that individual, leading to their complete destruction.</p><p></p><p>The terrifying scene of the sword qi tearing through the light pillar and the sudden explosion of the He Clan was still fresh in their memories.</p><p></p><p>Regarding Lu Changsheng, the major ancient tribes could only dare to think about him in their hearts, and they did not even dare to discuss him openly, as if he had become a taboo existence in the Ancient Realm of the Void.</p><p></p><p>...</p><p></p><p>After resting for a few days in the Ye Clan, Lu Changsheng bid them farewell and took He Xitong and her mother to the Ancestral Heavenly Realm.</p><p></p><p>As for the members of the Xiaoyao Sect, Lu Changsheng was temporarily too lazy to bother with them, so he just left them to train in the Qiankun Heaven.</p><p></p><p>The Qiankun Heaven was sufficient for them to hone their skills, after all, the Xiaoyao Sect did not even have a single Void Celestial at the moment.</p><p></p><p>Although they had spent a long time in the tower, they could not comprehend the Dao principles within it.</p><p></p><p>To advance to the Void Celestial realm, comprehending the Dao principles was the only path.</p><p></p><p>Most importantly, the upcoming Three Thousand Dao Realms were a higher-level immortal cultivation world, where the members of the Xiaoyao Sect would not be able to make much of an impression.</p><p></p><p>For Lu Changsheng, the current Xiaoyao Sect was quite useless, but he had no choice, since he was the one who established it, he had to take responsibility for it.</p><p></p><p>As for the old turtle, it was still in a coma, and Lu Changsheng did not want to bother with it. After all, the old turtle was not of much use, so it was better for it to remain in a coma for as long as possible, allowing Lu Changsheng to have some peace and quiet.</p><p></p><p>In fact, when he had previously disciplined the old turtle, Lu Changsheng had also mixed in some personal grievances.</p><p></p><p>The upcoming Three Thousand Dao Realms would be Lu Changsheng's own journey.</p><p></p><p>As for Chu Yu, he was just a clown, and Lu Changsheng did not take him seriously at all, treating him as a mere ant to be casually crushed.</p><p></p><p>The most important thing for this trip was that the Three Thousand Dao Realms had piqued his interest.</p><p></p><p>From Chu Yu's memories, in addition to the rampant Dao principles, there seemed to be powerful experts who had comprehended the Profound Truths.</p><p></p><p>The Profound Truths had already surpassed the Dao principles.</p><p></p><p>Lu Changsheng was curious to see whether these experts who had comprehended the Profound Truths would pose any threat to him.</p><p></p><p>To find the origin of his own existence, he had to traverse all the realms.</p><p></p><p>Lu Changsheng had a vague feeling that perhaps when he had defeated all the top experts in the boundless void, he would finally know everything.</p><p></p><p>...</p><p></p><p>In the Ancestral Heavenly Realm, in the Divine Emperor's Palace, Xing Tian was sitting quietly, his gaze distant and filled with solemnity and melancholy.</p><p></p><p>"First Guardian, the Divine Emperor summons you!" </p><p></p><p>Suddenly, a guardian of the Divine Emperor's Palace arrived, his tone slightly hurried.</p><p></p><p>Xing Tian was startled, his expression darkening for a moment, before he sighed and slowly stood up.</p><p></p><p>He was really getting tired of these days!</p><p></p><p>Didn't the Divine Emperor know that he was troubled lately?</p><p></p><p>He was always being called for both big and small matters, as if the Divine Emperor's Palace couldn't function without him, Xing Tian.</p><p></p><p>Soon, Xing Tian arrived at the palace where the Divine Emperor was, his face grim.</p><p></p><p>This time, if the Divine Emperor summoned him for some trivial matter again, he would definitely lose his temper!</p><p></p><p>He might as well just quit!</p><p></p><p>"Hehe, First Guardian, quickly look at who has come!" </p><p></p><p>Just as Xing Tian entered the hall with his head lowered, the voice of Divine Emperor Yin Yao rang out.</p><p></p><p>Xing Tian was slightly taken aback, and when he raised his head, he froze in place, his eyes soon brimming with tears!</p><p></p><p>What did he see?</p><p></p><p>He saw that Lu Changsheng had successfully rescued little Tong!</p><p></p><p>And the other woman, was she not the Jun'er he had been thinking about day and night?</p><p></p><p>Xing Tian trembled all over, and quickly rushed forward, reaching out his hand to greet them.</p><p></p><p>Here is my translation of the Chinese excerpt:</p><p></p><p>He Xi Tong tightly gripped He Tian Jun's hand.</p><p></p><p>"Tian, Tian Jun, is that really you!!"</p><p></p><p>At this moment, He Tian Jun's eyes were also slightly red. She gently stroked Xing Tian's face, her fingers tracing over the stubble, her voice slightly trembling:</p><p></p><p>"Big Brother Tian, please forgive Tian Jun for leaving without saying goodbye all those years ago. These past years, Xiao Tong has troubled you..."</p><p></p><p>Xing Tian raised his hand to grasp the hand that He Tian Jun was using to caress his face, stroking it gently: "I've never blamed you. You must have had your reasons... And Xiao Tong is also my daughter, how could she be any trouble."</p><p></p><p>Finished, he suddenly turned and knelt down in front of Lu Chang Sheng, the iron-willed man's voice now carrying a hint of a sob:</p><p></p><p>"Lord Lu, Xing Tian is useless, unable to save [her], yet I've troubled you..."</p><p></p><p>Lu Chang Sheng smiled slightly, gently lifting Xing Tian up from afar: "It was nothing. You three should reunite, I'll be on my way."</p><p></p><p>Xing Tian paused, then hurriedly said: "Lord Lu, why are you in such a hurry? Why not stay in the Divine Emperor's Palace, so that I may properly host you..."</p><p></p><p>Beside them, He Xi Tong's eyes held a hint of reluctance, but when she thought of her mother's lifespan, she understood...</p><p></p><p>Lu Chang Sheng waved his hand, glanced at the mother and daughter, then walked out, the blue-robed figure soon disappearing, with only a faint voice lingering in the hall.</p><p></p><p>"Xing Tian, do not waste time on me, you should properly reunite with your family."</p><p></p><p>"Lord Lu, I hope you will come to the Ancestral Heavenly Realm anytime, I will definitely host you well!" Xing Tian could only say.</p><p></p><p>"Seeing off Lord Lu!" Divine Emperor Yin Yao hurriedly bowed and saw him off.</p><p></p><p>Yin Yao smiled at Xing Tian before leaving, giving them space as a family.</p><p></p><p>Seeing this, Xing Tian's heart warmed, and his resentment towards Yin Yao also dissipated greatly.</p><p></p><p>"Tian Jun, these past years, you..."</p><p></p><p>Xing Tian quickly composed himself, looking at He Tian Jun hesitantly.</p><p></p><p>"Father, about Mother these past years..."</p><p></p><p>He Xi Tong was about to speak, but was interrupted by He Tian Jun raising her hand, smiling at Xing Tian: "Big Brother Tian, these past years, I've been well."</p><p></p><p>Xing Tian nodded dazedly, murmuring: "Well, that's good, that's good..."</p><p></p><p>Then, Xing Tian's eyes reddened as he laughed heartily: "From now on, we three can be happily together."</p><p></p><p>"Mm-hmm." He Tian Jun nodded gently with a soft smile.</p><p></p><p>Beside them, He Xi Tong, however, could not bring herself to smile.</p><p></p><p>At this moment, Xing Tian's thoughts were completely on He Tian Jun, not noticing as he said with a smile: "Come, Tian Jun, let me properly show you the place where Xiao Tong grew up, and tell you about what happened these past years."</p><p></p><p>"Okay."</p><p></p><p>...</p><p></p><p>In the boundless void.</p><p></p><p>Clad in blue robes, Lu Chang Sheng lay back with his hands behind his head, legs crossed, looking very at ease.</p><p></p><p>Lu Chang Sheng opened his eyes, calmly gazing at the unfathomable void.</p><p></p><p>By now, He Tian Jun should have already passed away.</p><p></p><p>He Xi Tong had likely prepared herself mentally, so she would be doing a bit better, but Xing Tian must have already collapsed.</p><p></p><p>"In this world, how could there ever be a perfect ending?"</p><p></p><p>Lu Chang Sheng seemed to self-mockingly smile, then slowly closed his eyes again, his hair swaying as his body drifted deeper into the void.</p><p></p><p>Soon, he disappeared from sight.</p><p></p><p>...</p><p></p><p>[The Qin Xian Chapter is complete]</p>

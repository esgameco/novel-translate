        <h1>Chapter 145</h1>
        <div class="content">
            <p>Here is the full English translation of the Chinese excerpt:</p><p></p><p>Lin Dong was stunned on the spot. As the fresh blood flowed over his eyes, he suddenly regained his senses, respectfully bowed once, and sat down in a daze.</p><p></p><p>Lu Changsheng slowly stood up, clasped his hands behind his back, and looked towards the horizon, saying, "After some time, I will leave the Immortal Realm. You all take care of yourselves."</p><p></p><p>Gu Helin and the others were shocked, their faces filled with reluctance.</p><p></p><p>"Master, are you going to the Ancestral Heavenly Realm?" Gu Helin asked respectfully.</p><p></p><p>"No," Lu Changsheng shook his head and smiled faintly, "It's another world. I might go there to open a tavern."</p><p></p><p>He was going to open a tavern in that world, both out of interest and for a reason.</p><p></p><p>The reason was...</p><p></p><p>Open a tavern???</p><p></p><p>Gu Helin and the others were puzzled.</p><p></p><p>Tong Xin, hearing this, was greatly intrigued. He rolled his eyes and gathered the courage to ask again, "M-Master, are you in need of a waiter?"</p><p></p><p>Upon hearing this, the light in Lin Dong's eyes also brightened.</p><p></p><p>Seeing this, Gu Helin felt a tinge of bitterness in his heart. Oh, these rebellious disciples, they were about to abandon their teacher!</p><p></p><p>However, the master was the master, and he sincerely hoped that his disciples could have the good fortune to follow him. After all, following the master was a rare and precious opportunity.</p><p></p><p>To be honest, if the master didn't mind, he also wanted to go!</p><p></p><p>Lu Changsheng was slightly surprised, and smiled as he looked at Gu Helin, "What? Are you going to abandon your teacher?"</p><p></p><p>"No, no, no! Master, you misunderstood! Helin is nothing. If the master needs Tong Xin and the others to do some menial tasks, please feel free to instruct them!" Gu Helin hurriedly waved his hands and said.</p><p></p><p>Lu Changsheng pondered for a moment, and then smiled in the expectant gaze of the others, "Alright then, you can come to my tavern as waiters. But let me make it clear, I won't be paying you a monthly salary."</p><p></p><p>"No need, no need, no need! Being able to serve under the master is already the greatest blessing for us. We dare not ask for a monthly salary!" Tong Xin exclaimed excitedly, his eyes shining with exhilaration.</p><p></p><p>Lin Dong also looked at Lu Changsheng in a daze, not expecting the master to actually agree...</p><p></p><p>"Good, but two people are enough," Lu Changsheng said.</p><p></p><p>The four were taken aback.</p><p></p><p>Gu Helin was the first to respectfully smile and say, "Master, Helin will not go. I have been at the White Moon Sect for over a thousand years and have a sense of belonging here. The sect master, elders, and senior brothers have all treated me well, so Helin will stay at the White Moon Sect."</p><p></p><p>The next moment, Chen Dajiao bowed and said, "Master, this opportunity should be left for Shidi Tong and Shidi Lin. I, Chen Dajiao, am usually dull-witted and not as sharp as Shidi Tong and Shidi Lin, so I will stay at the White Moon Sect to accompany the teacher."</p><p></p><p>Gu Helin was slightly surprised, and looked at Chen Dajiao with a touch of emotion. This youngest disciple was the most filial after all.</p><p></p><p>"Teacher, Shidi Chen..."</p><p></p><p>Tong Xin and Lin Dong felt ashamed, about to say something.</p><p></p><p>But then they heard Gu Helin's voice in their minds: "Tong Xin, Lin Dong, you don't need to say anything else. Follow the master and seize this great blessing!"</p><p></p><p>Tong Xin and Lin Dong fell silent.</p><p></p><p>Lu Changsheng smiled and said, "Then let's go."</p><p></p><p>Tong Xin and Lin Dong hurriedly bowed to Lu Changsheng, then knelt down to Gu Helin, their eyes slightly red, and said, "Teacher, take care!" </p><p></p><p>"And Shidi Chen... thank you."</p><p></p><p>Lu Changsheng sighed helplessly and said, "We're leaving. There's no need for such farewells, it's not a final separation. We'll meet again in the future."</p><p></p><p>With that, he waved his sleeve.</p><p></p><p>He then disappeared from the courtyard, taking Tong Xin and Lin Dong with him.</p><p></p><p>Gu Helin and Chen Dajiao stood there dumbfounded, then came to their senses and bowed towards the empty space.</p><p></p><p>"Farewell, Master."</p><p></p><p>After a moment, the two sighed.</p><p></p><p>The master... truly came and went in a hurry.</p><p></p><p>Here is the full English translation of the Chinese excerpt:</p><p></p><p>"Big Blade, I'm sorry to have put you through this."</p><p></p><p>Gu Helin patted Chen Dada's shoulder and comforted him gently.</p><p></p><p>He knew that anyone would feel a sense of unwillingness if they missed out on such a great opportunity.</p><p></p><p>But Chen Dada just smiled casually and bowed, saying, "Master, you are too kind. There is nothing to be sorry about. Ever since I encountered the Gentleman in the Ethereal Dust Realm, Big Blade has been luckier than anyone in the world."</p><p></p><p>Gu Helin paused and nodded with a smile.</p><p></p><p>"Good! The White Moon Sect is also excellent. From now on, we master and disciple shall make our home here."</p><p></p><p>"Yes." Chen Dada smiled warmly.</p><p></p><p>"Haha, come, follow me to register and get your sect robes and token. With the nurturing you received from the Gentleman before, with your talent, you should be able to become an inner disciple."</p><p></p><p>Gu Helin smiled and turned to walk out of the courtyard.</p><p></p><p>Chen Dada hurriedly followed.</p><p></p><p>But when the two reached the courtyard gate, they were stunned!</p><p></p><p>Outside the courtyard, there was a vast crowd kneeling!</p><p></p><p>Upon closer inspection, aside from Hai Dong and Wu Che, the rest were all the high-ranking members of the White Moon Sect, including the Sect Master and even an Elder who seemed to have been in seclusion.</p><p></p><p>"Sect... Sect Master, Elders, what is the meaning of this?" Gu Helin asked in bewilderment.</p><p></p><p>But as soon as he finished asking, he realized it must be because of the Gentleman, which was not surprising.</p><p></p><p>Phew, what a shock.</p><p></p><p>Seeing Gu Helin and an unfamiliar middle-aged man come out, the crowd all expressed joy.</p><p></p><p>The White Moon Sect Master's eyes were filled with trepidation as he hurriedly asked, "Helin, what about... the Immortal Emperor?"</p><p></p><p>Hearing the title "Immortal Emperor", the crowd, even though they already knew, were still shocked and at a loss.</p><p></p><p>Seeing them like frightened rabbits, Gu Helin smiled and quickly went over to help the Sect Master and an Elder up, comforting them, "Sect Master, Elder, and all the Elders, do not panic. The Immortal Emperor has already left."</p><p></p><p>Left?</p><p></p><p>"Phew~~~~~"</p><p></p><p>Immediately, sighs of relief could be heard all around. Although they still felt a lingering fear, they were greatly relieved.</p><p></p><p>It's good that he left! The Immortal Emperor, the number one figure of the Immortal Realm, they didn't dare to try to curry favor with him. Their White Moon Sect simply didn't have that qualification.</p><p></p><p>It's good that he left, otherwise they would be terrified that some mistake might upset the Immortal Emperor and get them annihilated.</p><p></p><p>The White Moon Sect Master calmed down and looked at Gu Helin with disbelief, saying with difficulty, "Helin, I never expected you to have a connection with the Immortal Emperor... With your status, even the Nine Star Sects would worship you, but in our White Moon Sect, it's..."</p><p></p><p>He was now speaking to Gu Helin softly and cautiously, afraid that his volume might accidentally rise.</p><p></p><p>Gu Helin quickly waved his hand and bowed, saying, "Sect Master, you are too kind. In these thousand years, I have become accustomed to living in the White Moon Sect, and you Elders and fellow disciples have all treated me extremely well. I will not leave the White Moon Sect."</p><p></p><p>The crowd was stunned, their gaze at Gu Helin becoming increasingly warm. With a connection to the Immortal Emperor, he could still be so unassuming and unpretentious.</p><p></p><p>They knew that if Gu Helin even said he wanted to become the Sect Master, they would not dare to refuse.</p><p></p><p>Hearing this, the White Moon Sect Master was at a loss for words.</p><p></p><p>At this time, Gu Helin pushed Chen Dada forward and smiled, "Oh yes, Sect Master, this is my disciple from the lower realm. He just ascended not long ago. Originally, there were two more disciples, but they just followed the Immortal Emperor."</p><p></p><p>Followed the Immortal Emperor?</p><p></p><p>Sss!!!</p><p></p><p>The crowd was shocked.</p>

        <div class="content">
            <p>Here is the full English translation of the Chinese excerpt:</p><p></p><p>The Realm of Bright Heavens. üëä‚ôò‚ûÖ‚ûàùêíƒ¶·ªÆùê±.ÂåöùïÜÁà™üêùüéÑ</p><p></p><p>The flight ascension passage in the vast desert.</p><p></p><p>With a creak, the passage gate was pushed open.</p><p></p><p>Elder Gu Helin, stroking his white beard and smiling contentedly, walked out from it.</p><p></p><p>Instantly, the thick immortal spiritual energy enveloped him.</p><p></p><p>"As expected of the Immortal Realm, even the spiritual power is dozens of times stronger than the Spiritual Dust Realm, unbelievable."</p><p></p><p>Elder Gu Helin sighed in admiration, already beginning to fantasize about the wonderful life he would have in the Immortal Realm.</p><p></p><p>"Hmm? Someone has come up."</p><p></p><p>"Let's go take a look."</p><p></p><p>At this moment, two young men in sect uniforms appeared before Elder Gu Helin, startling him. He took a step back, eyeing the two warily!</p><p></p><p>After scrutinizing them, he was greatly alarmed, they were so powerful, somewhat unfathomable!</p><p></p><p>"Oh? A Dao Immortal under a thousand years old?"</p><p></p><p>The two young men were somewhat shocked to see Elder Gu Helin.</p><p></p><p>Although his cultivation was unstable at the moment, the fact that he had ascended from the lower realm with a bone age of less than a thousand years was quite astonishing.</p><p></p><p>"Ahem, senior brothers, Elder Gu has just arrived, please guide me."</p><p></p><p>Elder Gu Helin slightly bowed, his nerves tense.</p><p></p><p>Not understanding the situation, he decided to be on his best behavior.</p><p></p><p>"Mm, this flight ascension passage is now overseen by our White Moon Sect. Your aptitude is not bad, so come back to the sect with us," one of the young men said indifferently.</p><p></p><p>Elder Gu Helin's tense nerves relaxed a bit, and he quickly smiled, "I'll follow you, senior brothers."</p><p></p><p>Seeing that Elder Gu Helin was so accommodating as to directly address them as senior brothers, the two young men's faces also broke into smiles as they introduced themselves.</p><p></p><p>"I'm Wu Che, you can call me Senior Brother Wu."</p><p></p><p>"I'm Hai Dong, you can call me Senior Brother Hai."</p><p></p><p>"Junior brother Gu Helin." Gu Helin's eyes darted around, and he cautiously asked, "Senior Brothers Wu and Hai, you just said this flight ascension passage is now overseen by our White Moon Sect. Wasn't it previously under another sect?"</p><p></p><p>Hearing this, Wu Che and Hai Dong fell silent for a moment.</p><p></p><p>Soon, Wu Che sighed and said, "Junior brother Gu, you don't know this, but over 600 years ago, this flight ascension passage was overseen by a minor sect, the Eternal Grand Sect. However... however, that sect was later destroyed by a senior in azure robes."</p><p></p><p>Hai Dong also nodded, this was no secret, the entire Realm of Bright Heavens knew about it.</p><p></p><p>Although it had been over 600 years, on that day in the City of Sand, when the three major immortal clans were being held accountable by the Patrol Hall, an azure-robed man had suddenly appeared and easily suppressed those Patrol Hall envoys!</p><p></p><p>This event was still a common topic of discussion in people's leisure time.</p><p></p><p>Hai Dong said regretfully, "It's really a pity, junior brother Gu. You could have joined that minor sect back then. But now, you can only join our unranked White Moon Sect. Junior brother Gu, Junior brother Gu?"</p><p></p><p>"Ah!" Gu Helin suddenly snapped back to attention and said in a deep voice, "How could that be, Senior Brother Hai? I am immensely grateful that I can join your sect now. If I had ascended a few hundred years earlier, I would have been destroyed along with the Eternal Grand Sect!"</p><p></p><p>Wu Che and Hai Dong exchanged glances, surprised that this junior brother could think from such an angle, but he did have a point.</p><p></p><p>Gu Helin took a light breath and casually asked, "Senior brothers, do you know anything about that azure-robed senior who destroyed the Eternal Grand Sect?"</p><p></p><p>"We've never met him, but we know he was incredibly powerful. Rumor has it that he single-handedly annihilated the Eternal Grand Sect and even slew the Patrol Hall envoys. Junior brother, you don't know how supreme the Patrol Hall's status is in our southern Immortal Realm..."</p><p></p><p>Hai Dong then went on to explain the general situation.</p><p></p><p>Gu Helin's scalp tingled, he had a premonition that the azure-robed senior was likely...!</p><p></p><p>"Senior brothers, before returning to the sect, can you take me to the ruins of the Eternal Grand Sect?" Gu Helin requested.</p><p></p><p>Wu Che and Hai Dong exchanged a puzzled glance, but didn't ask further, assuming Gu Helin just wanted to admire the prowess of that senior. So they nodded and agreed.</p><p></p><p>"Alright."</p><p></p><p>.........</p><p></p><p>In the airspace above the ruins of the Eternal Grand Sect.</p><p></p><p>Three figures appeared - Gu Helin, Wu Che, and Hai Dong.</p><p></p><p>"Junior brother, this is the ruins of the Eternal Grand Sect. As you can see, it's now just a pile of rubble..."</p><p></p><p>Here is the full English translation of the Chinese excerpt:</p><p></p><p>"The Heavenly Eternal Sect used to be the overlord sect in our Langtiandomain!" sighed Wu Che.</p><p></p><p>He and Haidong looked down below with contracted pupils. Although it was not their first time here, they were still extremely shocked every time they saw it.</p><p></p><p>Gu Helin remained silent. He stared blankly at the ruins below, and even though the area for miles around was in ruins, he could still see how grand the Heavenly Eternal Sect used to be.</p><p></p><p>Gu Helin couldn't help but close his eyes and start imagining that awe-inspiring scene.</p><p></p><p>A young man in blue robes stood in the air, his sleeves fluttering, and with a single palm strike, the dust scattered for miles.</p><p></p><p>"This gentleman is truly extraordinary," they murmured, even without having heard of Lu Changsheng's name before, they were already deeply impressed.</p><p></p><p>"Brother, Helin has seen enough, let's head back to the sect."</p><p></p><p>"Alright."</p><p></p><p>"Oh right, junior brother, when we return to the sect, you'll have to mine for three years according to the rules."</p><p></p><p>Gu Helin: "......"</p><p></p><p>...</p><p></p><p>In the Immortal Martial Continent, at the Heavenly Mechanism Pavilion.</p><p></p><p>In the Dao Courtyard,</p><p></p><p>Lu Changsheng opened his eyes, yawned lightly, and called out, "Old Turtle."</p><p></p><p>On the ground outside the courtyard, the swaying turtle shell, a turtle head and four limbs suddenly extended, then quickly crawled into the courtyard and transformed into a human form, hurrying in front of Lu Changsheng and bowing, "Master, what has Old Turtle been summoned for?"</p><p></p><p>"How long have I been asleep?" Lu Changsheng asked.</p><p></p><p>"It should have been a few hundred years," the Old Turtle replied vaguely.</p><p></p><p>The Old Turtle wasn't too clear either, as he hadn't gone out since the day he returned from the Immortal Emperor's Palace.</p><p></p><p>Lu Changsheng nodded, stood up and said, "Let's go, let's take a stroll in the Soul Realm."</p><p></p><p>Eh, the Soul Realm?</p><p></p><p>The Old Turtle paused for a moment, then exclaimed excitedly, "Okay!"</p><p></p><p>It had indeed been a long time since he had seen that fellow Hunxiu.</p><p></p><p>In the next moment, the two of them disappeared from the Dao Courtyard!</p><p></p><p>At the same time,</p><p></p><p>In the Immortal Emperor's Palace in the Southern Immortal Realm.</p><p></p><p>Ancient Yin-Yang had returned.</p><p></p><p>Li Hua and the others were in tears. For six hundred years, they had been bound with a red rope, completely naked! They had endured so many strange gazes, suffered so much mental torment, what a humiliation that was!</p><p></p><p>Now, the Immortal Emperor had finally returned!</p><p></p><p>In a palace in the Immortal Emperor's Palace, Li Hua and the others wore the long-forgotten robes, kneeling on the ground with reddened eyes.</p><p></p><p>Standing before them was a middle-aged man in a white robe, upright in bearing, with a faint "Emperor" character engraved on his forehead, his features stern and his indifferent face exuding an aura of authority.</p><p></p><p>This was the supreme ruler of the Southern Immortal Realm, the Yin-Yang Immortal Emperor, Ancient Yin-Yang!</p><p></p><p>"You three only went to the Heavenly Mechanism Pavilion, yet in the end you brought such trouble, tarnishing the reputation of the Immortal Emperor's Palace," Ancient Yin-Yang said indifferently.</p><p></p><p>"Immortal Emperor, it was not the Heavenly Mechanism Pavilion, we were harmed by a hunchbacked old man on our way back," Li Hua said tremblingly, head bowed.</p><p></p><p>Hunchbacked old man?</p><p></p><p>Ancient Yin-Yang's eyes flashed, with a wave of his sleeve, clearly not wanting to dwell on this matter any longer, as he had to go to the Heavenly Mechanism Pavilion soon, so he asked, "Before, when you went to the Heavenly Mechanism Pavilion to inspect the Main Hall, did you get any clues?"</p><p></p><p>Li Hua's heart trembled, and he quickly said respectfully, "Immortal Emperor, you don't know, the Heavenly Mechanism Pavilion has become audacious, they even said that the person behind the inspection of the Main Hall needs to be given face, even by you, and they..."</p><p></p><p>Soon, Li Hua recounted in detail everything that had happened in the Heavenly Mechanism Pavilion six hundred years ago, of course, with some exaggeration here and there, as they must regain this position!</p><p></p><p>It was true that they could not deal with that Nangong Jing, but as long as the Immortal Emperor sent an Immortal Saint or went personally, the Heavenly Mechanism Pavilion would be finished!</p><p></p><p>They kept their heads bowed, not noticing the surprise that had erupted in Ancient Yin-Yang's usually calm eyes!!</p><p></p><p>Ancient Yin-Yang kicked Li Hua and the others, sending them tumbling, and looked at the bewildered and fearful trio, saying sternly,</p><p></p><p>"You three are useless! The Emperor sees that you are the ones who have become audacious, go to the Punishment Hall and receive your punishment!"</p><p></p><p>After saying that, he suddenly remembered the hunchbacked old man they had mentioned earlier, and with this connection, a trace of excitement and nervousness flashed in his eyes. He took a step and disappeared.</p><p></p><p>The direction he went was towards the Immortal Martial Continent.</p>

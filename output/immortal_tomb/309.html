        <h1>Chapter 309</h1>
        <div class="content">
            <p>Here is the full English translation of the Chinese excerpt:</p><p></p><p>The boundless void where the Eternal Realm resides. üíö‚ôùÔºñ‚ùæùêíùìóùïåx.¬¢ùïÜ–ºüêôüíù</p><p></p><p>"The five Transcendent Dao cultivators we sent to hunt him down have died."</p><p></p><p>"...You can't be serious? Those were five Transcendent Dao cultivators at the Midworld level!"</p><p></p><p>"Do you think I'm joking?"</p><p></p><p>"Haha, it seems the Eight Ancient Clans have gone against us, the Dao. If they don't want to live in peace, then let's have some fun with them. Go contact the Dao of the Eternal Realm."</p><p></p><p>"You mean to..."</p><p></p><p>"What else? With the loss of five Transcendent Dao cultivators at the Midworld level in this boundless void, it seems we two have been moving around too little. The Eight Ancient Clans have already forgotten the big and small kings. Since that's the case, let's reshuffle the deck..."</p><p></p><p>"Mm."</p><p></p><p>...</p><p></p><p>The Eternal Realm, the Ancient Wasteland Ruins.</p><p></p><p>In the sky, a streak of light flashed, heading towards an unknown destination.</p><p></p><p>On the massive airship, there were only a dozen or so figures.</p><p></p><p>These were the people, including Lu Changsheng, who had come out of the Ancient Wasteland King City.</p><p></p><p>At this moment, the deck was relatively quiet, and everyone was looking, consciously or unconsciously, towards the figure in blue standing by the railing.</p><p></p><p>Nangong Wenxin, Li Qing, and the other prodigies were filled with trepidation, for they knew how powerful the person before them was.</p><p></p><p>Sword Cliff, the steward of the Ancient Wasteland Sword Clan, and two other young men stood respectfully there. </p><p></p><p>After being controlled by Lu Changsheng, they now only obeyed Lu Changsheng, just like Blood Demon Moon.</p><p></p><p>However, there was no sign of anything unusual about them.</p><p></p><p>"How long until we reach the Ancient Wasteland Sword Clan?"</p><p></p><p>Lu Changsheng asked indifferently while looking outside.</p><p></p><p>Sword Cliff hurriedly stepped forward and respectfully said, "My lord, the Ancient Wasteland Sword Clan is hidden in a secluded space in the far north of the Ancient Wasteland Ruins. At our current speed, we should arrive in about three days."</p><p></p><p>"Mm." Lu Changsheng nodded, then suddenly turned to look at Nangong Wenxin and the other prodigies.</p><p></p><p>"Senior!"</p><p></p><p>Nangong Wenxin and the other prodigies were startled and quickly knelt down.</p><p></p><p>"When we arrive at the Ancient Wasteland Sword Clan, behave yourselves."</p><p></p><p>"Senior, rest assured!"</p><p></p><p>Nangong Wenxin and the other prodigies immediately promised.</p><p></p><p>In truth, they were also struggling with mixed feelings. They had finally waited for the Prodigy Assembly to become Sword Attendants and join the Ancient Wasteland Sword Clan. Yet, this incident had occurred.</p><p></p><p>They were not fools and knew that Lu Changsheng was heading to the Ancient Wasteland Sword Clan. When they arrived, the clan would certainly not have a peaceful time.</p><p></p><p>They did not know what would happen... Sigh.</p><p></p><p>In any case, they had an ominous premonition in their hearts.</p><p></p><p>Lu Changsheng looked at Sword Cliff and asked, "Tell me about the Ancient Wasteland Sword Clan."</p><p></p><p>Sword Cliff hesitated for a moment, not knowing where to start.</p><p></p><p>"My lord, do you want to know about the clan's strength or...?"</p><p></p><p>"Strength," Lu Changsheng said.</p><p></p><p>"Well..." Sword Cliff hesitated slightly, then carefully said, "My lord, there are about a few hundred cultivators at the Godly Vault Realm in the clan..."</p><p></p><p>Hiss!</p><p></p><p>Nangong Wenxin, Li Shuo, and the others sucked in a cold breath.</p><p></p><p>A few hundred Godly Vault Realm experts?!</p><p></p><p>No wonder they are one of the Eight Ancient Clans. Excluding the Ancient Wasteland Sword Clan, the top powers in the entire Ancient Wasteland Ruins are just that many at the Godly Vault Realm.</p><p></p><p>Lu Changsheng frowned slightly and waved his hand, "Forget about the Godly Vault Realm trash. Tell me about the stronger ones."</p><p></p><p>The Godly Vault Realm, he had already experienced it in the Ancient Wasteland King City - it was just trash and weak.</p><p></p><p>Here is the full English translation of the Chinese excerpt:</p><p></p><p>‚Ñ¥ùìÇ</p><p></p><p>As for the realms beyond the Divine Concealment Realm, he was somewhat interested in them.</p><p></p><p>Although he was buried in front of the immortal tomb, his strength was not particularly outstanding, but the group of people who could suppress him must have some methods.</p><p></p><p>Cough, cough, Nangong Wenxin heard Lu Changsheng compare the Divine Concealment Realm to a common chicken and a stray dog, and felt somewhat suffocated in his heart.</p><p></p><p>However, they soon felt relieved. Indeed, the Divine Concealment Realm was an existence they looked up to, but for the person in front of them, it was just a common chicken and a stray dog, wasn't it?</p><p></p><p>"Master, there are nine experts at the Divine Dao Realm in the clan, including the six great sword masters, the clan leader, the elder, and the sword ancestor," Jian Yan said solemnly.</p><p></p><p>Nine people in the legendary Divine Dao Realm!! </p><p></p><p>The crowd was shocked to the core!!</p><p></p><p>The Divine Dao Realm, unheard of before, but now there are nine of them!</p><p></p><p>That level of realm is beyond their imagination, no wonder the Ancient Desolate Sword Clan is so revered and feared by their elders.</p><p></p><p>The Ancient Desolate Sword Clan is simply not something they can compare to.</p><p></p><p>Thinking about it now, the word "top-tier" seems a bit presumptuous.</p><p></p><p>If the senior before them were to provoke the Ancient Desolate Sword Clan, wouldn't that be courting disaster?</p><p></p><p>A glimmer of interest flashed in Lu Changsheng's eyes as he asked, "Divine Yang, Divine Concealment, I already know of them, but what is the Divine Dao?"</p><p></p><p>Not only Jian Yan, but even Nangong Wenxin and the others were stunned. They wanted to say, "Senior, are you joking? With your strength, shouldn't you be a Divine Dao Realm expert?"</p><p></p><p>Although Nangong Wenxin and the others didn't know what the Divine Dao was, it didn't prevent them from thinking that way.</p><p></p><p>Jian Yan fell silent for a moment, but adhering to the principle of answering whatever his master asked, he bowed and said, "Master, the Divine Dao Realm is vastly different from the Divine Yang and Divine Concealment Realms. The Divine Dao Realm cultivators have already begun to comprehend the Dao principles. As for the rest, Jian Yan is not very clear, after all, Jian Yan is only at the Divine Concealment Realm."</p><p></p><p>Towards the end, Jian Yan felt a bit embarrassed, as he was only at the Divine Concealment Realm and knew little about the Divine Dao Realm.</p><p></p><p>"Dao principles..." Lu Changsheng nodded slightly and said no more.</p><p></p><p>Beside him, Blood Demon Moon was actually a bit worried about Lu Changsheng. As the Holy Maiden of the Ancient Moon Blood Clan, she knew very well how powerful the Eight Great Ancient Clans were.</p><p></p><p>However, as a servant, she had no right to stop her master, and could only obey.</p><p></p><p>.........</p><p></p><p>Three days later.</p><p></p><p>The flying ship suddenly shook, startling the meditating group!</p><p></p><p>"Haha, don't panic, everyone. We've already entered the territory of the Ancient Clan. The ship just went through a spatial barrier, causing the shaking," Jian Yan soothed.</p><p></p><p>Then he looked at Lu Changsheng: "Master, we have arrived at the Ancient Desolate Sword Clan."</p><p></p><p>Jian Yan's heart was actually quite conflicted at the moment. He loved the Ancient Desolate Sword Clan, but he was also controlled by Lu Changsheng. He knew clearly that he was being controlled by Lu Changsheng, but he just couldn't resist it. </p><p></p><p>All he had was an infinite respect and obedience towards Lu Changsheng, a strange state that was hard to explain.</p><p></p><p>Nangong Wenxin and the other prodigies heard that they had arrived at the Ancient Desolate Sword Clan and quickly ran to the railing to look.</p><p></p><p>Suddenly, a continuous line of magnificent buildings appeared in their vision.</p><p></p><p>Each of the buildings was like a palace.</p><p></p><p>In the center of all the buildings, a massive stone sword stood, connecting heaven and earth.</p><p></p><p>Faint sword chants reverberated in the space, echoing in the minds of the crowd!</p><p></p><p>At the same time, several sword lights shot towards the flying ship where Lu Changsheng was!</p><p></p><p>"This is the Ancient Desolate Sword Clan, stop right there!"</p>

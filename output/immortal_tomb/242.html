        <h1>Chapter 242</h1>
        <div class="content">
            <p>Here is the full English translation of the Chinese excerpt:</p><p></p><p>"Lianyi, why did you kill your fellow disciple?" </p><p></p><p>Yunran suddenly turned her head, staring at Su Lianyi and questioning her.</p><p></p><p>The crowd also fixed their gaze on Su Lianyi.</p><p></p><p>Facing the many scrutinizing eyes, Su Lianyi steadied herself and said in a sorrowful tone, "Master, does this mean that it was Lianyi who killed Disciple Xu? These disciples from the Seven Emotions Valley haven't seen the full picture, they..."</p><p></p><p>But before she could finish, Yuanyang Qiu suddenly interrupted in a stern voice, "Absurd!"</p><p></p><p>He could no longer hold back, as he didn't expect that at this point, Su Lianyi would still dare to make excuses!</p><p></p><p>Yuanyang Qiu sneered, "You dare to say it's not because of the Jade Maiden's Mysterious Body? Our sect sees that you are one who doesn't shed tears until you see the coffin!"</p><p></p><p>As he spoke, a jade token appeared in his hand, and a recorded dialogue resounded through the hall:</p><p></p><p>"Lianyi, come to the old place at the hour of the ox tonight, our sect has captured that little girl..."</p><p>"Let me hear her voice."</p><p>"Hehe, that young lady has been knocked unconscious by our sect..."</p><p>"Then wake her up."</p><p>"......"</p><p></p><p>A deep male voice, and a cold female voice. That female voice, anyone could recognize it as Su Lianyi's!</p><p></p><p>Yunran and the elders' pupils contracted, looking at Su Lianyi in disbelief.</p><p></p><p>Su Lianyi's face turned deathly pale, and a bitter smile appeared on her face. She had finally been careless.</p><p></p><p>Yes, in terms of scheming, how could she possibly be a match for this old fox, Yuanyang Qiu.</p><p></p><p>She knelt down abruptly towards Yunran, tears streaming down her face, choking out, "Master... Lianyi was just momentarily confused."</p><p></p><p>Slap!!</p><p></p><p>Yunran suddenly slapped her hard.</p><p></p><p>Su Lianyi was knocked to the ground, her hair disheveled, her face swollen and red, with blood trickling from the corner of her mouth.</p><p></p><p>The hall fell silent.</p><p></p><p>The elders of the Upper Clarity Palace sighed inwardly, as in their memory, this was the first time the Sect Master had struck the Holy Maiden, and in front of so many outsiders.</p><p></p><p>Yunran closed her eyes and sighed:</p><p></p><p>"In terms of strength, you, Su Lianyi, are not the strongest among my Upper Clarity Palace disciples."</p><p></p><p>"But as your teacher, I saw your exceptional talent and good character, and deemed you most suitable to be the leader. I went against the majority opinion to establish you as my Upper Clarity Palace's Holy Maiden!"</p><p></p><p>"All these years, although we haven't been together day and night, I still see you often. I really didn't expect... that your scheming is so deep, and that you would actually harm your fellow disciple for your own selfish desires!"</p><p></p><p>"You have truly disappointed me greatly, Su Lianyi!"</p><p></p><p>Su Lianyi's body trembled, and she quickly straightened up, kowtowing and begging desperately, "Master! Lianyi knows she's wrong, Lianyi knows she's wrong, Lianyi is willing to accept any punishment from the Master, but please don't let Yuanyang Qiu take Lianyi away!!"</p><p></p><p>She knew that if she was taken away by Yuanyang Qiu, she would face a fate worse than death!</p><p></p><p>The calm face of the Taoist priest flashed in her mind, and she shuddered with fear!</p><p></p><p>Yunran sighed lightly, about to speak, but was interrupted by Yuanyang Qiu with a meaningful tone, "Sect Master Yun, our sect kindly advises you to think carefully... We are not just a match for that senior..."</p><p></p><p>In fact, Yuanyang Qiu wanted to let the Upper Clarity Palace seek their own demise.</p><p></p><p>But there were two reasons that firmly restrained him:</p><p></p><p>One, he had promised the senior to personally bring Su Lianyi before him. If Yunran interfered, it would be difficult to accomplish.</p><p></p><p>Two, the senior was clear-sighted, and Yuanyang Qiu had experienced it firsthand. If he deliberately aggravated the conflict between the senior and the Upper Clarity Palace, it would be disastrous.</p><p></p><p>Here is the full English translation of the Chinese excerpt:</p><p></p><p>The contradiction of the times... Relying on the senior's hand to overthrow the Upper Clarity Palace, but being discovered by the senior, he, Yuan Yang Qiu, is likely to die without a burial place!</p><p></p><p>New 69 Book Bar â†’ 69shu.com</p><p></p><p>Even if he has no such intention, if he is misunderstood by the senior at that time, then he will die wrongfully!!</p><p></p><p>So, the Upper Clarity Palace must not go against the senior at this moment!</p><p></p><p>Lest it implicates him.</p><p></p><p>Upon hearing this, the crowd was greatly shocked!!</p><p></p><p>As the sect master of the Yang Yuan Sect, Yuan Yang Qiu is actually not a match for that senior's single move??</p><p></p><p>The elders of the Upper Clarity Palace looked at Yun Mi, transmitting voice messages one after another, with an urgent tone,</p><p></p><p>"Sect Master, as the head of the palace, you must consider the whole palace!"</p><p></p><p>"Sect Master, Su Lian Yi has harmed her fellow disciples, and is no longer suitable to be the Holy Maiden. There are a few disciples in the palace whose cultivation is stronger than hers, and they can take on the role!"</p><p></p><p>"Sect Master, Su Lian Yi, as the Holy Maiden, has committed injustice first. At this time, you must not be soft-hearted!"</p><p></p><p>"......"</p><p></p><p>The voices of the many elders intertwined in Yun Mi's mind, causing her a splitting headache.</p><p></p><p>She suddenly shouted, "Shut up, all of you!"</p><p></p><p>Then, she looked at Yuan Yang Qiu again, and her gaze finally fixed on Su Lian Yi.</p><p></p><p>"Master..." Su Lian Yi pleaded.</p><p></p><p>Yun Mi moved her gaze away from Su Lian Yi and said in a stern voice, "Sect Master Yuan, you can bind Su Lian Yi and bring her before that senior, but this palace will go with you."</p><p></p><p>"Master! No!" Su Lian Yi's expression changed drastically.</p><p></p><p>Upon hearing this, Yuan Yang Qiu felt troubled, and with a wisp of immortal qi, he sealed Su Lian Yi's mouth.</p><p></p><p>"Mmph, mmph...!" Su Lian Yi tried to speak, but eventually succumbed to despair and regret.</p><p></p><p>"Good!" Yuan Yang Qiu's eyes flickered with a smile, "Then Sect Master Yun, please come with this sect. But when we arrive, Sect Master Yun must restrain yourself, lest you bring the destruction of the Upper Clarity Palace."</p><p></p><p>After saying this, Yuan Yang Qiu grabbed Su Lian Yi from a distance and walked out, saying, "Elders, please return to the sect first."</p><p></p><p>The elders of the Yang Yuan Sect heard this, their expressions gloomy. They also wanted to go and see, but dared not disobey Yuan Yang Qiu's words. "Yes, Sect Master."</p><p></p><p>As for the thoughts of these elders, Yuan Yang Qiu naturally knew about them. He didn't want to bring them along.</p><p></p><p>Keep them here first, and there will be a reason to go to the senior later.</p><p></p><p>"You all stay in the palace as well."</p><p></p><p>Yun Mi instructed indifferently, her sleeve fluttering as she disappeared along with Yuan Yang Qiu.</p><p></p><p>.........</p><p></p><p>A few days later,</p><p></p><p>Three figures appeared outside the Smoke and Rain Town.</p><p></p><p>They were Yuan Yang Qiu, Yun Mi, and the tightly bound Su Lian Yi.</p><p></p><p>At this time, Su Lian Yi's face was deathly pale, her spirit depressed and filled with fear.</p><p></p><p>During the journey to Smoke and Rain Town, she had been tormented in body and mind, tormented by the sense of impending doom.</p><p></p><p>She thought back to when she came to the clinic before, and how the azure-robed cultivator had been turned into a human stick...</p><p></p><p>Then what about her?</p><p></p><p>She was afraid of being chopped into countless pieces of meat.</p><p></p><p>The more Su Lian Yi thought about it, the more terrified she became, her very soul trembling.</p><p></p><p>Yun Mi's expression was one of doubt and vigilance as she surveyed the secluded little town before her. She found it hard to imagine that there was a powerful figure here who could withstand even one move from Yuan Yang Qiu.</p><p></p><p>"Hehe, Sect Master Yun, do you see that over there? That is the clinic where the senior resides," Yuan Yang Qiu gestured towards the southwest. "When we're in front of the senior, you'd better be careful and attentive. Let's go!"</p><p></p><p>With that, he grabbed the trembling Su Lian Yi and disappeared in a flash.</p><p></p><p>Yun Mi took a deep breath and followed closely behind.</p>

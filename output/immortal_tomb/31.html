        <h1>Chapter 31</h1>
        <div class="content">
            <p>Here is the full English translation of the Chinese excerpt:</p><p></p><p>"Sir. ‚ôôüí£Ôºñ‚ûàÔº≥ùì±ÔΩïùîµ.ùí∏ùëú‚ìú‚ô¶üêü"</p><p></p><p>"Sir."</p><p></p><p>"......"</p><p></p><p>Along the way, whether it was the servants encountered or the officials in official robes, they all respectfully greeted Lu Changsheng.</p><p></p><p>Lu Changsheng occasionally nodded slightly in response.</p><p></p><p>As for the young man behind him, he had already become numb, only feeling extremely nervous.</p><p></p><p>His heart became anxious, thinking that his previous attitude towards the sir had been a bit too relaxed and not respectful enough.</p><p></p><p>He had initially thought that the sir was a great Confucian scholar with immortal ancestors.</p><p></p><p>But he never expected... he had encountered a great figure who could reach the heavens.</p><p></p><p>The path was smooth and unobstructed, and soon Lu Changsheng led the young man to the back garden.</p><p></p><p>"You wait here, someone will arrange your accommodation later."</p><p></p><p>Lu Changsheng said a sentence and then walked into the courtyard.</p><p></p><p>The young man was stunned for a moment, then responded respectfully, "Sir, my name is Lin Dong."</p><p></p><p>But he didn't know if the sir had heard him, as the figure had already disappeared from sight.</p><p></p><p>Lin Dong sighed lightly, standing stiffly in place, looking at the luxurious buildings, his heart filled with great nervousness.</p><p></p><p>After all, he was just an eleven-year-old child.</p><p></p><p>"Hehe, the sir must be talking about you, right?" </p><p></p><p>At this time, the steward came over, smiling, and curiously examined Lin Dong up and down.</p><p></p><p>"Uh, hello, the sir told me to wait here."</p><p></p><p>Lin Dong hurriedly bowed, and at the same time was extremely puzzled, didn't the sir just go into the courtyard? Along the way, he didn't see the sir talk to anyone...</p><p></p><p>How come there's someone here to receive him?</p><p></p><p>Seeing the steward examining him, Lin Dong said embarrassedly, "I'm sorry, I'm a bit dirty, I haven't bathed in a long time, and have dirtied your eyes and nose."</p><p></p><p>The steward shook his head and chuckled lightly, "No problem, I'm the steward of this manor. I'll take you to your accommodation and let you clean up and change clothes."</p><p></p><p>The steward turned and led the way.</p><p></p><p>"The steward of the manor!"</p><p></p><p>Lin Dong's heart pounded again, the steward was actually personally coming to receive him. He had just thought that this unimpressive old man was just an ordinary servant.</p><p></p><p>The sir is really extraordinary.</p><p></p><p>This was Lin Dong's current thought.</p><p></p><p>...</p><p></p><p>On the way.</p><p></p><p>The steward glanced at the shabby young man following behind him, and couldn't help but ask with a smile,</p><p></p><p>"What's your name? You're quite lucky to know the sir."</p><p></p><p>The sudden remark startled Lin Dong, and he hurriedly bowed, "I, I'm called Lin Dong."</p><p></p><p>"Lin Dong." The steward nodded, his eyes flashing, seemingly casually asking, "The sir is kind-hearted, I suppose he took pity on you and brought you into the manor."</p><p></p><p>The eleven-year-old Lin Dong had no idea that this old fox was digging a pit for him, and immediately scratched his head and smiled sheepishly, "The sir said he wants to teach me immortal cultivation."</p><p></p><p>What?!</p><p></p><p>The steward was shocked, his body stumbling, almost falling over in surprise.</p><p></p><p>Lin Dong was startled, quickly stepping forward to support him, worriedly asking, "Steward, are you alright?"</p><p></p><p>"Don't!" The steward hurriedly pushed his hand away, looking at him solemnly, "When you speak to me in the future, don't call me 'you'! I'm not worthy of it!"</p><p></p><p>"Ah?" Lin Dong was a bit bewildered.</p><p></p><p>The steward looked deeply at Lin Dong, trying to see if there was anything special about him.</p><p></p><p>But how could his ordinary eyes see through it? He sighed deeply towards the heavens, "Lin Dong, you are truly blessed... it's no exaggeration to say you've ascended to the heavens in a single step."</p><p></p><p>Seeing the steward's reaction, Lin Dong's heart trembled.</p><p></p><p>He also realized how momentous the casual remark "Do you want to cultivate immortality?" from the man in the robe was for him.</p><p></p><p>Here is the full English translation of the Chinese excerpt:</p><p></p><p>Fate.</p><p></p><p>New69 Book Bar ‚Üí 69shux.com</p><p></p><p>.........</p><p></p><p>.........</p><p></p><p>On a night several days later, the night sky was twinkling with stars.</p><p></p><p>High up in the sky,</p><p>there was a spiritual boat flying through the clouds.</p><p></p><p>"Sect Master, do you really want to see the senior?" </p><p></p><p>Gu Helin's face looked a bit conflicted. He leaned on the railing, looking at the distant mountains that were faintly visible - that was where the immortal tomb was, and this also meant they were about to arrive at Moyu Town.</p><p></p><p>"What? Elder Gu, if you have something to say, just say it directly," Shen Miaoyun said, glancing at him indifferently.</p><p></p><p>"Hehe." The Second Elder beside them shook his head and chuckled.</p><p></p><p>On the deck behind them, dozens of Foundation Establishment disciples were sitting cross-legged, their childlike hearts also present.</p><p></p><p>Since they were about to reach their destination, they had already finished their cultivation.</p><p></p><p>At this moment, they were looking at the three figures in the front of the spiritual boat with reverence, feeling very nervous.</p><p></p><p>After all, these were their Sect Master, the Second Elder, and Elder Gu!</p><p></p><p>Normally, there were rarely such a small number of disciples accompanying three figures of such high status going out...</p><p></p><p>"Senior Brother Tong, what exactly happened?" </p><p></p><p>Many disciples looked at Tong Xin, their eyes full of curiosity.</p><p></p><p>Although some of them had cultivation bases higher than Tong Xin, his status was much higher than theirs.</p><p></p><p>Among all these Foundation Establishment disciples, Tong Xin was the only one who was a direct disciple.</p><p></p><p>They only knew that the demonic disturbances in the mundane world had become more severe than before, but they didn't know anything else.</p><p></p><p>"Fellow disciples, don't ask me about this. The Master has instructed that this matter cannot be discussed for now. Perhaps you will know when the time comes," Tong Xin said with a bitter expression.</p><p></p><p>Facing these fellow disciples at the same Foundation Establishment stage, he couldn't act as aloof as he did when facing the Qi Refinement disciples.</p><p></p><p>"Alright." </p><p></p><p>The disciples shook their heads and sighed, understanding that they shouldn't ask further.</p><p></p><p>At the same time,</p><p></p><p>"Old Gu, the Sect Master is talking to you," the Second Elder hurriedly reminded Gu Helin, seeing that he was lost in thought.</p><p></p><p>"Ah, oh, what were you saying, Sect Master?" Gu Helin turned his head to look at Shen Miaoyun.</p><p></p><p>Shen Miaoyun's expression was slightly cold. In the entire Qingcloud Sect, only Gu Helin dared to space out while talking to her. She took a light breath and looked at the Second Elder, signaling him.</p><p></p><p>The Second Elder understood, and said, "Elder Gu, weren't you just asking the Sect Master if she really wanted to see the senior? And then the Sect Master told you to speak your mind directly."</p><p></p><p>Gu Helin also noticed Shen Miaoyun's expression, and quickly said, "Sect Master, you can go see the senior. I, Gu, won't stop you. But I want to remind you that if the senior has an unfriendly attitude or says something that displeases you, please be patient and don't get into a conflict."</p><p></p><p>At the same time, he sighed inwardly, thinking, "If a fight really breaks out, Sect Master, you may not get the better end of it."</p><p></p><p>The air fell silent.</p><p></p><p>Shen Miaoyun looked at Gu Helin and said indifferently, "Elder Gu, you are overthinking. Our Sect has never met that cultivator, and we have no enmity. How could we possibly fight?"</p><p></p><p>Although Shen Miaoyun's tone was calm, Gu Helin and the Second Elder could still hear her displeasure.</p><p></p><p>So the two of them fell silent, exchanged a glance, and retreated with a bow towards Shen Miaoyun.</p><p></p><p>Their crisis awareness was strong, and they knew it was unwise to linger near the Sect Master at this time.</p><p></p><p>Seeing this, Shen Miaoyun sighed lightly, unable to help but wonder what kind of illusion that cultivator had used, that even Gu Helin would be so respectful towards him.</p><p></p><p>After all, Gu Helin, relying on his superb alchemy skills, didn't really care about many cultivators in the cultivation world!</p><p></p><p>And at this moment, her gaze turned towards the bottom, where a small town was faintly visible.</p><p></p><p>Moyu Town, they had arrived.</p>

        <h1>Chapter 173</h1>
        <div class="content">
            <p>Here is the full English translation of the Chinese excerpt:</p><p></p><p>The heavens and earth fell silent for a moment, then suddenly erupted in an exclamation. ‚ô£‚òù‚ùª‚ûà‡∏£–Ωùìæùìç.ùî†ùê®œªüéÄ‚ô¶</p><p></p><p>This black-armored man was actually sent by the Proprietor?</p><p></p><p>Outrageous, truly outrageous.</p><p></p><p>This is the Wind, Thunder, and Fire Envoys, can this strange black-armored man handle them? If not, quickly summon the Proprietor!</p><p></p><p>"Eh, isn't he the same black-armored man from the tavern just now?"</p><p></p><p>"Yes, he seems to have come with us just recently, but this person didn't even drink any wine in the tavern, he just went straight to the Proprietor to discuss something, no wonder, it turns out he's one of the Proprietor's men."</p><p></p><p>"The Proprietor is indeed unfathomable, he actually has such a powerful henchman... but still..."</p><p></p><p>"But what? Didn't you hear what the black-armored man said just now? I feel like he didn't even take the three Envoys seriously at all."</p><p></p><p>"......"</p><p></p><p>Some cultivators who had just come out of the Longevity Tavern had a deep impression of Xing Tian.</p><p></p><p>"Is that him?"</p><p></p><p>Peng Fang, who was originally preparing to ascend to the heavens, frowned when he saw Xing Tian.</p><p></p><p>He suddenly felt a bit confused, unable to understand how this black-armored man knew the Proprietor.</p><p></p><p>"Young man, who is he? Do you know?" Peng Fang asked, tilting his head.</p><p></p><p>"Cough, senior, the one in the sky is called Xing Tian, the senior." Left Chou Shan replied, bowing.</p><p></p><p>Peng Fang nodded without saying anything further, instead focusing his spirit on the sky.</p><p></p><p>Meanwhile, inside the Longevity Tavern.</p><p></p><p>Lu Changsheng was lying on a rocking chair sleeping,</p><p></p><p>While a group of cultivators had already quietly come to the courtyard, holding wine jars and cups, drinking and watching the sky, their expressions a mix of tension and excitement.</p><p></p><p>As for what they were transmitting in their conversations, that was unknown.</p><p></p><p>Tong Xin and Lin Dong were standing by the side, helpless, ready to attend to the customers at any time, as the shop assistants, they naturally put the customers first.</p><p></p><p>.........</p><p></p><p>The three Envoys' brows were tightly furrowed,</p><p></p><p>Finally understanding why the Clan Leader had sent the three of them. It turns out there was such a powerful black-armored man in the Longevity Tavern!</p><p></p><p>The aura of the black-armored man... estimated to be at the Eight-Turning Immortal Emperor realm.</p><p></p><p>If he truly is an Eight-Turning Immortal Emperor, then today they might have to return empty-handed.</p><p></p><p>Because the three of them were at the Seven-Turning Immortal Emperor realm, even with excellent coordination, they would still have no chance against an Eight-Turning Immortal Emperor.</p><p></p><p>"Wind Envoy, Thunder Envoy, let's retreat first."</p><p></p><p>The Lightning Envoy decisively transmitted.</p><p></p><p>Since they had no chance of winning, there was no need to drag it out. Retreat first, and when the Clan sends a stronger expert, they can come back and attack then!</p><p></p><p>"Mm." The Wind Envoy and Fire Envoy didn't argue, knowing that even if they stayed, it would just be a waste of time, better to retreat than be unable to subdue him and end up even more embarrassed.</p><p></p><p>"Retreat!"</p><p></p><p>The three Envoys exchanged a glance and turned to tear open the space and retreat!</p><p></p><p>Xing Tian's eyes flashed coldly, the corner of his mouth seeming to have a faint sneer. He suddenly raised his hand and clenched his fist.</p><p></p><p>The surrounding space blurred for a moment, as if some subtle change had occurred.</p><p></p><p>At this moment, the Wind, Thunder, and Fire Envoys abruptly turned to stare at Xing Tian, their expressions greatly shaken. The Wind Envoy growled,</p><p></p><p>"You've sealed the space!"</p><p></p><p>The countless cultivators watching were already dumbfounded.</p><p></p><p>The three Envoys of the Jiang Clan Empire were just about to leave, but what's this? </p><p></p><p>Peng Fang's eyes narrowed, this black-armored man was indeed no ordinary person.</p><p></p><p>Xing Tian's face was cold, not bothering to say more, as he was not the type to beat around the bush.</p><p></p><p>The next moment, he suddenly swung out a beam of light, and upon closer inspection, it was a bundle of luminous ropes.</p><p></p><p>"If you have anything to say, you can go tell the Proprietor."</p><p></p><p>Xing Tian was also unsure of Lu Changsheng's intentions, so he decided to capture these three troublemakers and bring them to Lu Changsheng first.</p><p></p><p>"You think you can capture us? Preposterous!" </p><p></p><p>The Fire Envoy stepped forward, a hint of mockery on his face.</p><p></p><p>Unless there was an absolute power advantage, capturing was much more difficult than simply killing!</p><p></p><p>"Wind Envoy, Thunder Envoy, let's combine our strength to destroy this rope!" The Fire Envoy stared at the approaching light, quickly saying.</p><p></p><p>"Mm." The Wind Envoy and Thunder Envoy nodded solemnly.</p><p></p><p>Here is the full English translation of the Chinese excerpt:</p><p></p><p>Though it was said that way, they would not be the least bit careless, after all, the one in front of them was the Eight-Turning Immortal Emperor.</p><p></p><p>Immediately, the three of them simultaneously made a simple hand seal, and the immortal spiritual power surged up in the sky like a tidal wave, centered around the three of them.</p><p></p><p>At that moment, the sky became gloomy, and the weather became as if a storm was about to arrive.</p><p></p><p>The many cultivators in this space felt suffocated, for the immortal spiritual power in the air was so overwhelming that it pressed down on them uncomfortably. This was the Seven-Turning Immortal Emperor, who had already reached the level where he could slightly communicate with the Heavenly Dao.</p><p></p><p>The Wind, Thunder, and Fire Envoys saw that the gathering of spiritual power was complete, and they abruptly unleashed the solidified spiritual power towards the approaching luminous rope.</p><p></p><p>There was confidence in their eyes, as they looked down on the Eight-Turning Immortal Emperor. Since they saw him gathering power, then... he would surely be made to drink a bitter cup.</p><p></p><p>This level of immortal spiritual power was enough to pose a threat to the careless Eight-Turning Immortal Emperor.</p><p></p><p>Boom!!</p><p></p><p>In the next moment, the torrential immortal spiritual power poured down on the luminous rope, to the shock of the onlookers.</p><p></p><p>This terrifying immortal spiritual power, this small luminous rope would surely be destroyed in an instant.</p><p></p><p>But... soon, the pupils of the onlookers shrank.</p><p></p><p>"How is this possible!"</p><p></p><p>The Wind, Fire, and Thunder Envoys also had their expressions change in alarm.</p><p></p><p>They saw that the luminous rope showed no signs of being destroyed, but instead absorbed their released overwhelming immortal spiritual power completely!</p><p></p><p>They were suddenly filled with dread, realizing that something was amiss.</p><p></p><p>But there was no time to ponder further, they quickly exchanged a glance and reached a tacit understanding!</p><p></p><p>"Immortal art, Wind, Fire, Thunder - Summon!"</p><p></p><p>The sky instantly turned blood-red, with countless arcs of lightning flashing between the clouds, and the gentle breeze also became strange in that moment!</p><p></p><p>But just then...</p><p></p><p>Xing Tian's face flashed with a hint of impatience as he said, "Isn't it better to surrender quietly without wasting time?"</p><p></p><p>Saying that, he suddenly slapped out!</p><p></p><p>Bang!</p><p></p><p>The faces of the Wind, Fire, and Thunder Envoys suddenly turned deathly pale, as if they had been struck heavily, their minds entering a momentary daze.</p><p></p><p>And in that moment, the luminous rope abruptly bound the three of them!</p><p></p><p>When their consciousness returned, and they realized the bindings on them, their hearts jumped, and they gritted their teeth to try to break free, but found it impossible to budge.</p><p></p><p>The heavens and earth fell silent, as no one had ever imagined that the famous Jiang Clan's Three Envoys would be so dramatically captured...</p><p></p><p>Without even really starting to fight.</p><p></p><p>How could this black-armored man be so formidable, when they had never heard of him before?</p><p></p><p>Xing Tian's expression was indifferent as he was about to take the three Envoys to the Longevity Tavern to hand them over to Lu Changsheng for disposal, </p><p></p><p>when a figure in azure robes slowly appeared before him.</p><p></p><p>Xing Tian paused, quickly bowing, "Senior Lu!"</p><p></p><p>The Wind, Fire, and Thunder Envoys, seeing Xing Tian's respectful attitude towards the azure-robed man, had their eyelids twitching violently!!</p><p></p><p>"Ah, the Proprietor!" Many cultivators who recognized Lu Changsheng were immediately shaken.</p><p></p><p>"This azure-robed man is the Proprietor of the Longevity Tavern who has been making waves lately?" There were also many cultivators who had never seen Lu Changsheng, their eyes filled with doubt and astonishment!</p><p></p><p>The heavens and earth were in an uproar, with clamor never-ending.</p><p></p><p>Lu Changsheng slightly furrowed his brow and said indifferently, "Silence!"</p><p></p><p>These two words were like thunderclaps, suddenly exploding in everyone's minds!</p><p></p><p>The cultivators were shocked pale-faced, whether familiar with Lu Changsheng or not, their gazes now filled with great fear.</p><p></p><p>Lu Changsheng flashed in front of the Wind, Fire, and Thunder Envoys, looking at the tense three, and chuckled lightly, "I haven't even settled the old scores with your Jiang Clan yet, and your Jiang Clan has already come to provoke me one after another..."</p><p></p><p>Except for the well-informed Xing Tian,</p><p></p><p>the Wind, Fire, and Thunder Envoys, as well as the crowd in the heavens and earth, were all somewhat dazed.</p><p></p><p>Old scores? What did he mean?</p><p></p><p>But the next sentence from the azure-robed man's mouth caused all expressions to change drastically!</p><p></p><p>"From today onwards, the Heavenly Scar, the Jiang Clan, shall no longer exist."</p>

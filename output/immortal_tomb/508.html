            <p>Here is the full English translation of the Chinese excerpt:</p><p></p><p>The Celestial Divine Realm.</p><p></p><p>In the Divine Emperor's Palace, Xing Tian was lost in thought when he suddenly saw a figure in blue robes appear before him. He immediately stood up in surprise:</p><p></p><p>"Lord Lu!"</p><p></p><p>Lu Changsheng smiled faintly, "Seeing you lost in thought, what were you thinking about?"</p><p></p><p>Xing Tian's expression was bitter, but he still smiled and said, "Lord Lu must know why Xing Tian was lost in thought."</p><p></p><p>Lu Changsheng patted his shoulder and then softly said, "Don't be sad, everyone has their own destiny."</p><p></p><p>Xing Tian nodded and respectfully asked, "Lord Lu, why have you come?"</p><p></p><p>"Xing Tian, I may need to take Tong to a dangerous place, are you willing?" Lu Changsheng said directly.</p><p></p><p>Dangerous? Dangerous place! </p><p></p><p>Even Lu Changsheng said it was dangerous, Xing Tian immediately understood that it was a place where one had a slim chance of survival.</p><p></p><p>"Lord Lu, may Xing Tian go with you?" Xing Tian asked respectfully.</p><p></p><p>Lu Changsheng shook his head, "You are too weak... In fact, Tong is not strong enough either, but her Eternal Calamity Body is something I can make use of in that place."</p><p></p><p>Xing Tian fell silent for a moment, then bowed and said, "Please wait, Xing Tian will summon Tong."</p><p></p><p>Lord Lu had done his family a great kindness, Xing Tian would not and dared not refuse.</p><p></p><p>"Father, you called me... Brother, Sir!" </p><p></p><p>When Hei Tong arrived, she immediately saw Lu Changsheng and happily came before him to pay her respects.</p><p></p><p>"Tong, are you willing to go with me to a dangerous place? Don't rush to agree, I can tell you that you may even lose your life there."</p><p></p><p>Lu Changsheng said with a faint smile.</p><p></p><p>Hearing this, Xing Tian's face paled, and he lowered his head in silence.</p><p></p><p>Hei Tong unhesitatingly said, "Sir, Tong is willing to go, is it because you have a use for Tong's Eternal Calamity Body?"</p><p></p><p>Hei Tong was clear about her own value. If even Sir said it was dangerous, then she, Hei Tong, would be in even greater peril. The only thing she could think of was her Eternal Calamity Body.</p><p></p><p>Lu Changsheng looked at Hei Tong approvingly, "Not bad."</p><p></p><p>At the same time, Lu Changsheng looked at Hei Tong, and in the depths of his gaze there was a trace of complex emotions.</p><p></p><p>To him, Hei Tong might have a bit of the meaning of a chess piece.</p><p></p><p>It turns out that their initial encounter in the Spiritual Dust Realm was not accidental, and from the Spiritual Dust Realm to the present, his repeated rescues were not without purpose.</p><p></p><p>It was just an unconscious action.</p><p></p><p>"Father, Tong..."</p><p></p><p>Hei Tong looked at Xing Tian, hesitating to speak.</p><p></p><p>Xing Tian looked up and smiled at Hei Tong, "Lord Lu has done our family a great kindness. If the Lord has a need, I will not hesitate to go through fire and water, only I am too weak to be of any help to the Lord."</p><p></p><p>"Yes." Hei Tong nodded firmly, her eyes red.</p><p></p><p>What moved her was her father's understanding.</p><p></p><p>If Sir had a need for her, she was more than happy to go.</p><p></p><p>Sir's encounters with her in the Eternal Calamity, his repeated rescues and teachings, as well as his rescue of her mother and herself in the Qiankun Heavenly Clan, were all true acts of great kindness.</p><p></p><p>"Lord Lu, Xing Tian dares to ask, are you..."</p><p></p><p>Xing Tian stroked Hei Tong's head, finally unable to hold back as his eyes reddened and he asked.</p><p></p><p>He knew this was not appropriate, but he just couldn't help it.</p><p></p><p>Tian Junzhu had died, and now Tong was going, and she might never return.</p><p></p><p>Thinking about it, his heart was torn apart with pain.</p><p></p><p>Lu Changsheng looked at Xing Tian for a long time, then softly said:</p><p></p><p>"This trip is to eliminate the evil spirits and save the endless void."</p><p></p><p>Xing Tian and Hei Tong were stunned.</p><p></p><p>Now that Xing Tian's vision had opened, he naturally knew what the endless void represented.</p><p></p><p>The Ancestral Celestial Divine Realm they were in was boundless, but it was just a speck of dust in the endless void, or perhaps even less than a speck of dust...</p><p></p><p>Xing Tian's chest heaved for a moment, and he knelt down in worship, trembling as he said:</p><p></p><p>"Great Lord, Xing Tian and the countless living beings of the Ancestral Celestial Divine Realm, as members of the endless void, are powerless to help. Xing Tian represents the billions of lives of the Ancestral Celestial Divine Realm... to express our gratitude to you!"</p><p></p><p>Lu Changsheng chuckled, his gaze flashing, and Xing Tian was lifted up.</p><p></p><p>Xing Tian trembled as he looked at Lu Changsheng for a moment, then quickly lowered his head and softly said, "Great Lord, those evil spirits must be terrifying, how many people are you planning to take with you..."</p><p></p><p>Creatures that could endanger the entire endless void, their terror was beyond his imagination.</p><p></p><p>Lu Changsheng said casually, "Including Tong, no more than ten."</p><p></p><p>Xing Tian: "......"</p><p></p><p>At this moment, Xing Tian's heart was in turmoil, so much so that he was in a state of panic.</p><p></p><p>"Great Lord, the endless void is so vast, there must be many powerful experts, why don't you gather more helpers."</p><p></p><p>Xing Tian knew Lu Changsheng must have his reasons, but he was truly worried.</p><p></p><p>Lu Changsheng said indifferently, "The final destination of this trip is extremely far, and I will be leaving in a couple of days, so I won't be able to."</p><p></p><p>"You and Tong can chat for a while, and when it gets a little darker, I'll come to take her away."</p><p></p><p>With that, Lu Changsheng slowly disappeared.</p><p></p><p>"Respectfully seeing off the Great Lord (Sir)."</p><p></p><p>Xing Tian and Hei Tong slowly stood up, exchanging a glance, their eyes all trembling.</p><p></p><p>The news of the crisis in the endless void was too sudden, and the two of them were still somewhat dazed.</p><p></p><p>If it were not for Lu Changsheng saying it himself, no matter who else told them this, </p><p></p><p>Here is the full English translation of the Chinese novel excerpt:</p><p></p><p>They all just thought of him as a fool, spouting nonsense.</p><p></p><p>Xing Tian looked at the spot where Lu Changsheng had previously stood, and said in a hoarse voice:</p><p></p><p>"Tong'er, if I hadn't boldly asked the elder just now, he might not have even mentioned this matter... Such a big thing, yet the elder has been sneaking around at night..."</p><p></p><p>He Xitong remained silent, her eyes dazed.</p><p></p><p>...</p><p></p><p>At the same time, Lu Changsheng had not left the Divine Emperor's Palace, but had instead cast his divine sense across the entire Ancestral Heaven Realm, quickly locating four figures.</p><p></p><p>In the Heavenly Saint Divine State, within the Divine King's Hall.</p><p></p><p>There were four people sitting and drinking.</p><p></p><p>"It's been tens of thousands of years in the blink of an eye, I wonder where the Immortal Emperor Changsheng and the old turtle have gone to play."</p><p></p><p>"It seems to be more than just tens of thousands of years, time has passed too quickly, it's been too long, I can't even remember clearly."</p><p></p><p>"To be honest, I'm really envious of the old turtle, being able to follow Immortal Emperor Changsheng. I don't know what kind of good luck the old turtle has, I also want to go to the boundless Void, the Ancestral Heaven Realm feels so boring."</p><p></p><p>"No, why are you being so yin-yang and weird every day? I'm really fed up with you. The old turtle has that talent, do you ancient Yin-Yang match up?"</p><p></p><p>"You!"</p><p></p><p>"Ah, my friends, I've missed Immortal Emperor Changsheng a bit!"</p><p></p><p>The one who spoke last was Chu Lingtian.</p><p></p><p>The other three were evidently the other three Immortal Emperors of the Four Directions Immortal Realms - Gu Yinyang, Feng Nine, and Shi Wushi.</p><p></p><p>They were now all Divine Kings in the Divine King's Hall, having already reached the peak, otherwise they would still be striving to advance. They felt their prospects were limited, and even wanted to leave the Ancestral Heaven Realm and venture into the boundless Void.</p><p></p><p>"Oh? What charm do I possess that makes the Immortal Emperor Lingtian miss me so?"</p><p></p><p>Suddenly, a light laugh sounded, and a young man in blue robes appeared dreamlike in the hall.</p><p></p><p>Chu Lingtian and the others were stunned, their gazes filled with disbelief, quickly followed by ecstatic joy as they all abruptly stood up, trembling with excitement.</p><p></p><p>"Immortal... Immortal Emperor Changsheng!!"</p><p></p><p>...</p><p></p><p>"Come, Immortal Emperor Changsheng, have a drink!"</p><p></p><p>On the table, Gu Yinyang carefully poured wine for Lu Changsheng, his face unable to hide his joy.</p><p></p><p>Taking the opportunity, Lu Changsheng glanced at the four of them and said, "It seems you four have been doing well in the Ancestral Heaven Realm."</p><p></p><p>Feng Nine smoothed her hair and raised her wine cup, saying, "We owe it all to the grace of Immortal Emperor Changsheng."</p><p></p><p>"Yes, we owe it to the grace of Immortal Emperor Changsheng!" Chu Lingtian and the other two also hurriedly raised their wine cups, their expressions filled with deep gratitude and reverence.</p><p></p><p>Shi Wushi rubbed his head and chuckled, "If it weren't for Immortal Emperor Changsheng, let alone the Ancestral Heaven Realm, the four of us would have probably long since perished in the Four Directions Immortal Realms."</p><p></p><p>Lu Changsheng gave a slight smile, clinked cups with them, and then drained his cup.</p><p></p><p>Gu Yinyang immediately stood up to refill the wine.</p><p></p><p>"Immortal Emperor Changsheng, these years, where have you and the old turtle gone to play? Oh, where is the old turtle?"</p><p></p><p>As Chu Lingtian asked, he suddenly realized the old turtle was not there.</p><p></p><p>The other three also reacted.</p><p></p><p>"The old turtle, he passed away long ago, I simply held a simple funeral for him in his world."</p><p></p><p>Lu Changsheng said with a light smile.</p><p></p><p>What?!</p><p></p><p>Chu Lingtian and the others widened their eyes, and tears immediately flowed out!</p><p></p><p>"The old turtle has actually died..."</p><p></p><p>Shi Wushi took a big gulp of wine, then grabbed his head and wailed, "Turtle, my turtle!"</p><p></p><p>Gu Yinyang and Feng Nine also trembled, struggling to breathe.</p><p></p><p>This sudden bad news.</p><p></p><p>It hurt, it hurt so much!</p><p></p><p>At this moment, a mini black turtle appeared on the table, sticking out its head in confusion, "Huh? Master, didn't you tell me to familiarize myself with the laws? Why are you calling the old turtle out? Eh! It's you, Chu Lingtian, Shi Wushi... So it's actually you!"</p><p></p><p>Wham!</p><p></p><p>The wailing abruptly stopped.</p><p></p><p>Chu Lingtian and the others stared blankly at the turtle, not dead? Then wasn't their mourning in vain?</p><p></p><p>They had already mourned, but you didn't die, isn't that inappropriate?</p><p></p><p>Shi Wushi quickly grabbed the turtle shell and rubbed it against his face, wiping his nose in the process.</p><p></p><p>"Ah, old turtle, I'm so glad you're not dead! Wuwu!"</p><p></p><p>"Shi Wushi, you little bastard, wishing for the turtle grandpa to die, are you sick? Damn it, where are you wiping your snot?!"</p><p></p><p>The old turtle hadn't even finished speaking when Lu Changsheng waved his sleeve and threw it back into the Demon-Subduing Tower, then smiled at the four of them, "I was just testing you, hmm, your reactions are not bad, I'm sure the old turtle is also very happy."</p><p></p><p>Chu Lingtian and the others looked embarrassed, coughing as they sat back down.</p><p></p><p>Lu Changsheng finished the wine in his cup, then stood up and said, "Alright, you drink, I'll be leaving now."</p><p></p><p>Chu Lingtian and the others were suddenly taken aback, why was he leaving so hurriedly?</p><p></p><p>They quickly stood up as well.</p><p></p><p>Chu Lingtian anxiously asked, "Immortal Emperor Changsheng, are you... are you leaving already?"</p><p></p><p>Lu Changsheng nodded slightly, "There are some matters I need to attend to."</p><p></p><p>"When will Immortal Emperor Changsheng come to the Ancestral Heaven Realm next?"</p><p></p><p>Feng Nine asked expectantly.</p><p></p><p>Lu Changsheng smiled at the four of them, then his blue robes gradually dissipated.</p><p></p><p>"I won't be coming back."</p><p></p><p>...</p><p></p><p>[The Knowing Fate Chapter is complete]</p>

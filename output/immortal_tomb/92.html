        <h1>Chapter 92</h1>
        <div class="content">
            <p>Here is the full English translation of the Chinese excerpt:</p><p></p><p>Outside the Purple Extreme Thunder Peak...</p><p></p><p>The cultivators who had been waiting for a long time for the arrival of Li Ling and the elders of the Purple Extreme Thunder Peak were clearly becoming more and more dissatisfied.</p><p></p><p>"Hehe, fellow Daoists, I wonder what instructions you have for our Purple Extreme Thunder Peak?" </p><p></p><p>Li Ling asked with a smile as he cupped his hands.</p><p></p><p>This scene left everyone stunned, but they all fell silent.</p><p></p><p>They may claim not to fear the Purple Extreme Thunder Peak, but when facing the sect master himself, they still held back, not daring to tear their faces off completely.</p><p></p><p>Soon, a cultivator in the early Tribulation Crossing stage stepped forward and solemnly said with cupped hands, "Fellow Daoist Li, regarding the demonic calamity that broke out in the Eastern Domain, could you please explain to us why the Purple Extreme Thunder Peak did not take any action?"</p><p></p><p>Li Ling pondered for a moment and smiled, "Regarding this matter, I'm truly sorry, fellow Daoists. When the demonic calamity occurred, our Purple Extreme Thunder Peak did not receive the news in time. By the time we were about to dispatch our disciples, the calamity had already been resolved, hehe."</p><p></p><p>Hearing this, everyone was stunned.</p><p></p><p>Wasn't this just blatantly lying?</p><p></p><p>The Tribulation Crossing cultivator's expression darkened as he said, "Fellow Daoist Li, in fact, we all came here today just wanting an explanation. But you're obviously trying to fool us all..."</p><p></p><p>The expressions of the crowd also turned unpleasant.</p><p></p><p>"Fellow Daoists, please return. What we just said is our explanation. Whether you believe it or not, our sect master has no other way to respond."</p><p></p><p>Li Ling smiled and turned to lead the elders back to the Purple Extreme Thunder Peak.</p><p></p><p>The Tribulation Crossing cultivator glared at Li Ling's retreating back and growled, "Your Purple Extreme Thunder Peak is so tyrannical!"</p><p></p><p>Li Ling's body stiffened, but he ignored it and disappeared with the elders.</p><p></p><p>Although the Patriarch was not currently in the mountain, Li Ling was confident that these people would not dare to act against the Patriarch.</p><p></p><p>In the cultivation world, cultivation power and strength were the ultimate authority.</p><p></p><p>"Fellow Daoists, let's go back. Not to mention anything else, the reputation of the Purple Extreme Thunder Peak is now gone. Who will still acknowledge it as the number one sect in the Eastern Domain in the future?"</p><p></p><p>"Let's go and spread this matter to the other three domains. The Purple Extreme Thunder Peak, hehe..."</p><p></p><p>"Can everyone really swallow this bitter pill? Shall we join forces and..."</p><p></p><p>"Don't be silly. If we could have done something, we would have done it long ago, not wait until now..."</p><p></p><p>"That's right. Jiang Yuan alone is enough to handle all of us here. What can we use to fight him?"</p><p></p><p>"Sigh, let's just disperse."</p><p></p><p>At the same time, inside the Purple Extreme Thunder Peak,</p><p></p><p>Li Ling sensed the departing cultivators from the other sects and felt a slight relief in his heart.</p><p></p><p>After all, with Jiang Yuan not present, if these people were determined to cause trouble, it would be quite difficult to deal with.</p><p></p><p>...</p><p></p><p>"You're afraid too?!" </p><p></p><p>Tiger Battle suddenly stood up, looking at Jiang Yuan in disbelief.</p><p></p><p>Jiang Yuan pursed his lips and calmly said, "The Demon Sovereign is not the kind of person to speak recklessly."</p><p></p><p>"What the hell do you believe her for!" Tiger Battle let out a low roar, displeased, "If I had known, I wouldn't have told you! You cowardly wretch!"</p><p></p><p>Jiang Yuan's mind flashed with the image of the blue-robed figure, and he said in a firm voice, "Jiang's Ascension Tribulation is also about to come. If what the Demon Sovereign said is true... Jiang does not wish for his cultivation of thousands of years to be destroyed in an instant."</p><p></p><p>"What about immortality? The secrets of immortality in the Immortal Tomb, you just said you don't want them anymore? As for Ascension, how does that help you live forever?"</p><p></p><p>Tiger Battle growled, his emotions somewhat agitated.</p><p></p><p>"Hehe, Demon Lord, if it were before, Jiang would not mind accompanying you to break open the Immortal Tomb. Because in the end, there would only be two results, and for Jiang, who is about to Ascend, it doesn't matter either way."</p><p></p><p>"But now, there is that uncertain factor. A single miscalculation could plunge me into an abyss of no return, turning thousands of years of bitter cultivation into nothing! Even if that's the case, whether the Immortal Tomb can be broken open in the end is still unknown. Jiang knows what is more important."</p><p></p><p>Jiang Yuan stood up expressionlessly.</p><p></p><p>Tiger Battle let out a cold laugh, "Jiang Wuji..."</p><p></p><p>Here is the full English translation of the Chinese excerpt:</p><p></p><p>"Such is the case, you Jiang Yuan are also like this, a pair of cowards as timid as mice!" </p><p></p><p>Jiang Yuan raised his eyelids and cupped his hands, saying, "Let the Demon Venerable think as he wishes, I shall take my leave."</p><p></p><p>"Stay!" Hu Zhan growled.</p><p></p><p>Jiang Yuan turned around and tilted his head, waiting for his next words.</p><p></p><p>Hu Zhan stared at Jiang Yuan's back and said mysteriously, "Since the plan to plunder the immortal tomb, it is our demonic realm that has suffered the greatest losses. You and Jie Wuqing have managed to escape unscathed... Jie Wuqing is understandable, since he withdrew early on, and I'm too lazy to say much about him. But you?"</p><p></p><p>Jiang Yuan turned around, "So what does the Demon Venerable mean?"</p><p></p><p>"If you were to back out, this plan would have no chance of continuing with just our demonic realm... But what do you take our demonic realm for, that you can come and go as you please?"</p><p></p><p>Hu Zhan's mouth curled up in a sinister smile as he spoke coldly.</p><p></p><p>Jiang Yuan's pupils contracted slightly: "Are you going to fight me?"</p><p></p><p>Hu Zhan grinned: "It's you who have gone too far."</p><p></p><p>Jiang Yuan's expression became slightly grave as he said, "You won't be able to keep me here."</p><p></p><p>"Can't keep you? Then I'll have to break your arm." Hu Zhan said in a deep voice.</p><p></p><p>"Fellow Daoist Hu, we meet again after parting at the immortal tomb."</p><p></p><p>At this moment, a gentle voice sounded in the main hall.</p><p></p><p>Hu Zhan and Jiang Yuan both stiffened and turned their heads. A young man in blue robes was sitting there cross-legged, like a ghost, and they hadn't noticed him at all...</p><p></p><p>Lu Changsheng!</p><p></p><p>The hall fell into an eerie silence.</p><p></p><p>"Lu... Fellow Daoist Lu... Haha." </p><p></p><p>Hu Zhan laughed dryly, also glancing at Lu Changsheng's shoulders, which were empty this time, without the tortoise.</p><p></p><p>Jiang Yuan's eyes flickered rapidly, somewhat trembling.</p><p></p><p>This was the second time he had seen the young man in blue, but this time, the pressure he felt was immense!</p><p></p><p>"Sit." Lu Changsheng smiled.</p><p></p><p>He then picked up the wine jar and poured himself a cup of tea, as if he were in his own home.</p><p></p><p>Hu Zhan and Jiang Yuan exchanged a glance, then slowly sat down.</p><p></p><p>The two who had just been adversaries quickly reached a consensus with a single glance.</p><p></p><p>If this Lu Changsheng had ill intentions, they would definitely join forces against him first!</p><p></p><p>"Don't be nervous, I won't do anything to you." Lu Changsheng soothed.</p><p></p><p>But the more he said this, the more Hu Zhan and Jiang Yuan felt their bodies stiffen.</p><p></p><p>As the Demon Venerable of the demonic realm and the Elder of the Purple Extreme Thunder Peak, they were now constrained in every way.</p><p></p><p>Whether it was their aura or something else, they were suppressed to the extreme.</p><p></p><p>Lu Changsheng looked at Hu Zhan, pausing until Hu Zhan became nervous, then said, "You little demon tiger, learn a thing or two from that Demon Lord, and use your brain a bit more."</p><p></p><p>Hu Zhan's expression changed drastically. His true form had actually been seen through!</p><p></p><p>Impossible, he had never revealed his true form in public before!</p><p></p><p>In an instant, the Lu Changsheng before Hu Zhan became extremely unfathomable.</p><p></p><p>Seeing Hu Zhan's state, Jiang Yuan also felt his scalp tingle, sensing that something was off everywhere.</p><p></p><p>"In this Mortal Realm, it's not easy to have a Roaring Demon Tiger. Live well and strive to ascend to the Four Celestial Realms one day, where there is a clan of Roaring Demon Tigers - that is your destiny."</p><p></p><p>Lu Changsheng smiled lightly, then looked at Jiang Yuan, and Jiang Yuan hurriedly lowered his head, not daring to make eye contact.</p><p></p><p>"Haha."</p><p></p><p>Lu Changsheng chuckled and gradually dissipated.</p><p></p><p>"Phew~~~"</p><p></p><p>Hu Zhan and Jiang Yuan took a deep breath, their foreheads covered in cold sweat. Recalling the brief conversation just now, they exchanged a horrified look!</p><p></p><p>The Four Celestial Realms...</p><p></p><p>"Demon Venerable, this... this Senior Lu, do you still have designs on that immortal tomb?" Jiang Yuan's tone was quite strained.</p><p></p><p>He was inwardly extremely relieved that he had been relatively stable, otherwise it would have been a matter of life and death.</p><p></p><p>Hu Zhan, upon hearing this, looked around in alarm and glared at him, shouting, "What nonsense are you talking about! When has the Venerable ever had designs on the immortal tomb! Jiang Yuan, if you dare to speak such nonsense again, I will strike you down with a palm!"</p>

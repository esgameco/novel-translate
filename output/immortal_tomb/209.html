        <h1>Chapter 209</h1>
        <div class="content">
            <p>Here is the full English translation of the Chinese excerpt:</p><p></p><p>The outside world had gone crazy, but the central region of the extreme cold ice field had fallen into a deathly silence. </p><p></p><p>The various sects had only just regained their senses, and they looked at the Xiaoyao Sect's camp with reverence, then carefully shifted their gaze to the side of Leifeng and the others...</p><p></p><p>The current junior sect master of the Great Day Thunder Sect was right here, after all...</p><p></p><p>Fu Mingyan lightly pressed his dry lips, glancing out of the corner of his eye at Leifeng, his heart filled with an indescribable feeling.</p><p></p><p>The Xiaoyao Sect had just had some conflicts with his Xuanhuo Sect, and he never expected them to run into the Great Day Thunder Sect so soon.</p><p></p><p>This was truly...</p><p></p><p>Behind Leifeng and Leiting, the faces of Zhao Hufaand Lin Hufa looked very unsightly.</p><p></p><p>But they didn't dare to act rashly!</p><p></p><p>They were not like the countless uninformed people outside - they could see the strength of the Xiaoyao Sect very clearly here!</p><p></p><p>Their overall strength might not be as good as their Great Day Thunder Sect, but it was definitely far superior to a second-grade sect!</p><p></p><p>Leifeng paused for a moment, then suddenly raised his head and looked towards the Xiaoyao Sect, cupping his hands and smiling from afar, "Fellow cultivators of the Xiaoyao Sect, this junior sect master will wait for your arrival within the sect, we shall meet again in three months."</p><p></p><p>With that, he and the other three disappeared from the scene.</p><p></p><p>With such a major event happening, Leifeng had no mood to watch the competition of the ninth-grade sects.</p><p></p><p>As the junior sect master, he had to hurry back to the Great Day Thunder Sect and report this to his father.</p><p></p><p>The Xiaoyao Sect was no simple matter, his Great Day Thunder Sect could not afford to be careless.</p><p></p><p>...</p><p></p><p>In the Xiaoyao Sect's camp, </p><p>Tong Xin and Lin Dong's gazes were grave - this junior sect master of the Great Day Thunder Sect was no ordinary person.</p><p></p><p>At this time, Peng Fang waved his hand, "Let's go."</p><p></p><p>Moments later, </p><p>the Xiaoyao Sect also departed.</p><p></p><p>In the central region of the extreme cold ice field, only Fu Mingyan and the rest remained, along with the densely packed sects.</p><p></p><p>Everyone was silent, </p><p>the shocking event that had just occurred made the competition feel somewhat tasteless to them.</p><p></p><p>They knew that the upcoming competitions of the eighth, seventh, and sixth-grade sects, as well as the fifth, fourth, and third-grade sect competitions, </p><p>would be far less eye-catching and dazzling compared to the confrontation between the Xiaoyao Sect and the Great Day Thunder Sect.</p><p></p><p>The battle between a ninth-grade sect and a first-grade sect, </p><p>this fight, perhaps the entire region and even the heavenly domain would pay attention to it.</p><p></p><p>After all, such unprecedented level-jumping was unlikely to happen again in the future.</p><p></p><p>"Ahem." Fu Mingyan cleared his throat, interrupting everyone's thoughts. He said indifferently, "Sects, prepare yourselves, the competition is about to begin!"</p><p></p><p>Immediately, the expressions of the various sects became solemn.</p><p></p><p>They also wanted to finish quickly and then rush to the Lightning Continent to witness the level-jumping battle!</p><p></p><p>...</p><p></p><p>In the sky above the extreme cold ice field, the Xiaoyao Sect's spirit ship was slowly gliding.</p><p></p><p>On the deck, Zuo Qishan looked at Peng Fang and asked, </p><p>"Grand Elder, are we going directly to the Lightning Continent?"</p><p></p><p>Hearing this, Su Qianghe and the others also looked at Peng Fang, as the Sect Master was not here, the Grand Elder was the primary decision-maker.</p><p></p><p>Peng Fang looked at the golden characters in the sky, pondering, "Hmm, the Sect Master must already know of this matter, let's head directly to the Lightning Continent."</p><p></p><p>"Understood." Zuo Qishan and the others responded.</p><p></p><p>The next moment, the spirit ship abruptly changed direction, then with a thunderous roar, it shot out, disappearing into the distance as a point of light.</p><p></p><p>At the same time, in the mist below,</p><p>Lu Changsheng's eyes peered through the ice mist, gazing far away at the direction where the Xiaoyao Sect's spirit ship had vanished.</p><p></p><p>Then, with a casual tear in space, he leisurely stepped in.</p><p></p><p>Here is the full English translation of the Chinese excerpt:</p><p></p><p>The battle between Zong Yue and the Great Sun Thunder Sect has attracted much attention, and everyone is eagerly awaiting that day's arrival. This matter has caused a huge commotion in both the Earthly Realm and the Heavenly Realm.</p><p></p><p>Naturally, countless cultivators from the Earthly Realm and the Heavenly Realm have rushed to the Thunder Realm's Lightning Continent through teleportation arrays.</p><p></p><p>As a result, the Lightning Continent has been overcrowded during this period.</p><p></p><p>Three months is far too short!</p><p></p><p>Now, there are only three days left until the battle across realms!</p><p></p><p>The Carefree Sect has also quietly arrived in the Thunderclap City without attracting anyone's attention. After all, in these three months, everyone has only heard of their name but has never seen them.</p><p></p><p>...</p><p></p><p>Thunderclap City is the core city of the Lightning Continent and is the closest to the Great Sun Thunder Sect.</p><p></p><p>At this time, the city is teeming with cultivators, shoulder to shoulder, as if the entire Thunderclap City is about to burst.</p><p></p><p>Discussions are rife:</p><p></p><p>"It's been three days, but we still haven't seen the legendary Carefree Sect."</p><p></p><p>"That's not surprising. Aside from the Nine Rank Sects that participated in the Grand Competition in the Extreme Cold Glacier three months ago, who else has seen the Carefree Sect? With the crowds in Thunderclap City, even if you encountered them, how can you be sure you'd recognize them?"</p><p></p><p>"...How will this battle across realms be conducted? I hope it's not the same old one-on-one combat, that would be boring."</p><p></p><p>"It shouldn't be. The Nine Rank Sects are nothing, the Great Sun Thunder Sect won't waste time on them. After this period of fermentation, the Carefree Sect can be said to have made a big splash, and now who hasn't heard of them?"</p><p></p><p>"That's true, but during this time, we've seen some Third Rank Sects, so why haven't we seen any Second or First Rank Sects?"</p><p></p><p>"Heh, those high-level sects wouldn't be here in the crowded streets. They're probably already comfortably resting in the Great Sun Thunder Sect."</p><p></p><p>"Ah, I wonder what the Carefree Sect's Patriarch is thinking, daring to challenge a First Rank Sect."</p><p></p><p>At this time, in a nearby restaurant,</p><p></p><p>Lu Changsheng sighed as he entered the crowded restaurant. The restaurant was completely full, and the waiters were running around frantically. The restaurant owner was beaming behind the counter - he had made a fortune these past three months.</p><p></p><p>Lu Changsheng didn't want to find another place, as he knew the entire Thunderclap City was likely packed.</p><p></p><p>He walked towards a table by the window, where two men and a woman were seated.</p><p></p><p>The three noticed the approaching young man in green robes and were slightly surprised. What did he want?</p><p></p><p>Lu Changsheng stopped in front of them and smiled lightly, "May I have this table, gentlemen?"</p><p></p><p>The three were stunned. Before they could say anything, Lu Changsheng took out a handful of colorful spirit stones, at least twenty, and placed them on the table.</p><p></p><p>The three were shocked. As outer sect disciples of an Eight Rank Sect, they had never seen so many colorful spirit stones!</p><p></p><p>"Senior, we..." Zhao Ran started to speak.</p><p></p><p>Lu Changsheng placed another handful of spirit stones on the table, smiling, "Is this not enough? I have more if you need."</p><p></p><p>Stone...stones?</p><p></p><p>This senior is really extravagant!</p><p></p><p>The three were completely dumbfounded, unable to resist swallowing hard.</p><p></p><p>Especially Zhao Ran, who had only wanted to give up the seat, never expecting to receive so many spirit stones.</p><p></p><p>The next moment, Zhao Ran hurriedly stood up with her two fellow disciples, offering the seat to Lu Changsheng.</p>

        <h1>Chapter 90</h1>
        <div class="content">
            <p>Here is the full English translation of the Chinese excerpt:</p><p></p><p>Gulp...</p><p></p><p>The crowd was frantically swallowing their saliva. °°°·.°·..·°¯°·._.· ➅➈รᕼ𝕌𝔵.cØ๓ ·._.·°¯°·.·° .·°°°</p><p></p><p>The Second Elder and these cultivators had better vision, and they could see a turtle-shaped underground cave on the ground.</p><p></p><p>It turns out that the senior was actually a turtle...</p><p></p><p>It's just that the senior's palm strike was so terrifying.</p><p></p><p>The incredibly powerful Serpent Demon King and those demonic beasts actually exploded the moment the palm strike was unleashed.</p><p></p><p>Lu Changsheng's figure flashed, and he came to stand in the palace.</p><p></p><p>"Senior!!"</p><p></p><p>The Second Elder and Tongxin hurriedly went to greet him, their faces full of joy and surprise.</p><p></p><p>The other disciples looked at Lu Changsheng with reverence, so this was the senior they often mentioned.</p><p></p><p>How powerful.</p><p></p><p>"Senior!"</p><p></p><p>The King of the離水 Kingdom, who had just escaped death, also hurriedly came with his officials to pay respects.</p><p></p><p>At the same time, the King of the 離水 Kingdom's heart was in a panic...</p><p></p><p>Lu Changsheng looked at the King of the 離水 Kingdom and smiled, "It's been a while, and you've actually gained spiritual energy. It seems you've encountered some fortuitous opportunity."</p><p></p><p>Huh?</p><p></p><p>The Second Elder and the others looked at the King of the 離水 Kingdom with puzzlement, and their expressions soon changed. Indeed, he had some spiritual energy, though it was still very weak and hard to detect without careful examination.</p><p></p><p>What's going on? Wasn't the King of the 離水 Kingdom without a spiritual root before? How did he suddenly have spiritual energy?</p><p></p><p>And where did this cultivation method come from? There shouldn't be any refining energy techniques in the mundane world.</p><p></p><p>The King of the 離水 Kingdom's face turned pale as he looked up and forced a smile, "Senior is absolutely right. I recently happened to encounter a wandering immortal, and that wandering immortal had a deep connection with me, so he brewed a special medicinal bath for me to soak in. I, I don't know how I suddenly gained spiritual energy..."</p><p></p><p>Lu Changsheng's eyes flashed slightly, and he smiled, "I see."</p><p></p><p>"Senior!! That's not how it is!! The King has stolen the opportunity you left for Big Dao! He has imprisoned Big Dao in the celestial prison. If it weren't for the sudden demonic calamity, the King would have had no time, and Big Dao might have been executed already!! Senior, you can go to the celestial prison to see for yourself!"</p><p></p><p>Suddenly, Dong Ge raised his head and pointed at the King of the 離水 Kingdom, roaring furiously!</p><p></p><p>Everyone was shocked!</p><p></p><p>The officials were also stunned, looking at Dong Ge...</p><p></p><p>The King of the 離水 Kingdom's face stiffened, and he turned his head in disbelief, trembling, "Why... why..."</p><p></p><p>Dong Ge suddenly took off his black hat and slammed it to the ground hard!!</p><p></p><p>He pointed angrily at his own forehead, his tone hysterical, like a wild beast's roar:</p><p></p><p>"Why? For eight years, the empire has fallen into dire straits time and time again, and the officials have remained silent. When was it not me, Dong, who mustered the courage to speak up! You each time swore to promote and reward me, but when was it ever true?! Eight years, eight years, do you know how I've been living? I'm fed up with this position! I don't want it anymore!"</p><p></p><p>The King of the 離水 Kingdom staggered, his face ashen.</p><p></p><p>He never expected to die at the hands of his own people... He remembered that when he seized Chen Dao's opportunity, it was also this Dong Ge who plotted it...</p><p></p><p>Could this be a trap set up by Dong Ge?</p><p></p><p>Dong Ge always had a smiling face towards him, seemingly very loyal. But it turns out his thoughts were buried so deeply.</p><p></p><p>Whenever the King asked Dong Ge if he minded, Dong Ge always smiled and said he didn't mind, saying something about being loyal to the king and living off the king's salary, and so on.</p><p></p><p>Why didn't you show some dissatisfaction on your face? Don't let me think you're so easily exploited!</p><p></p><p>This Dong Ge has deep thoughts, and apart from his skin and flesh, everything else is probably rebellious!</p><p></p><p>It's both because of Dong Ge and the downfall of Dong Ge...</p><p></p><p>The King of the 離水 Kingdom painfully closed his eyes and said, "Mm, Dong Qing, it is my fault towards you."</p><p></p><p>Seeing this, Dong Ge sneered, "What do you owe me? Old me is going to take you down with me today! None of us is getting out of this alive!"</p><p></p><p>At this time, Lu Changsheng smiled faintly and said, "Take me to the celestial prison to take a look."</p><p></p><p>...</p><p></p><p>The capital, the celestial prison.</p><p></p><p>"Sir, the tremor just now was too violent, I feel like the celestial prison was about to collapse."</p><p></p><p>The old steward said, looking at the ceiling.</p><p></p><p>"Mm." Chen Dao said softly from the other side. "It's quiet outside now, so it seems the demonic calamity is over. Next, the King should have time to..."</p><p></p><p>Here is the full English translation of the Chinese excerpt:</p><p></p><p>"We've got you, butler... It's the master who has implicated you, making your twilight years so unsettled..."</p><p></p><p>The old butler smiled calmly: "The master speaks too highly. We are master and servant, inseparable. It doesn't matter whether I'm implicated or not, especially since this old servant doesn't have much time left anyway."</p><p></p><p>Hearing this, Chen Dadao was moved and fell silent, pursing his lips.</p><p></p><p>The old butler sighed: "Whether this old servant lives or dies doesn't really matter. It's just that the master's days are still long... Ah, if only the gentleman were here, he could clear our names."</p><p></p><p>Thud, thud, thud...</p><p></p><p>At this moment, a series of rapid footsteps approached.</p><p></p><p>The old butler and Chen Dadao paused, leaning against the prison wall and closing their eyes, resigning themselves.</p><p></p><p>The time of their death had arrived.</p><p></p><p>Listening to the rapid footsteps, it seemed the King of Lishui and his officials had arrived.</p><p></p><p>They didn't expect the King of Lishui to be so impatient.</p><p></p><p>The demonic calamity had just ended, and now they were coming to deal with them.</p><p></p><p>Hmph...</p><p></p><p>Soon, the footsteps in the dungeon stopped, and the environment fell silent.</p><p></p><p>Chen Dadao and the old butler still had their eyes closed, unwilling to look at the people outside the prison.</p><p></p><p>"Your clothes are so thin, leaning against the cold prison wall. Aren't you cold?"</p><p></p><p>At this moment, a familiar voice reached their ears.</p><p></p><p>Chen Dadao and the butler suddenly trembled! </p><p></p><p>They opened their eyes shakily and mechanically turned their heads towards the outside of the prison.</p><p></p><p>A young man in blue robes, a figure they remembered, was standing there calmly, his clean blue robes as before.</p><p></p><p>Chen Dadao and the butler's noses suddenly stung, and they choked out, "Gen...tleman."</p><p></p><p>Lu Changsheng nodded with a smile: "Mm."</p><p></p><p>...</p><p></p><p>A few days later, the demonic calamity in the Eastern Domain had completely subsided.</p><p></p><p>This was naturally related to the old turtle, who had disappeared somewhere. As for why Lu Changsheng had destroyed a sect in the Immortal Realm before coming to Lishui, it was because the old turtle had gone to other parts of the Eastern Domain first to kill some demonic beasts.</p><p></p><p>However, despite this, the casualties in the Eastern Domain had still reached a staggering number.</p><p></p><p>Reconstruction work was in full swing across the Eastern Domain, including in the Lishui Empire.</p><p></p><p>However, the King of Lishui had committed suicide, and for now, Dong Ge was temporarily acting as the King of the Lishui Empire.</p><p></p><p>The Second Elder self-righteously believed that Dong Ge had helped Lu Changsheng, so he temporarily handed the position of king over to Dong Ge.</p><p></p><p>However, all the officials knew that since the immortal had spoken, Dong Ge's position as king was now stable, and he would likely become the hereditary ruler in the future, bringing glory to his ancestors and becoming the ultimate winner.</p><p></p><p>Whenever they thought of this, they all beat their chests in regret, regretting that they didn't have the courage to stand up and expose the king like Dong Ge did at the time.</p><p></p><p>But they realized that Dong Ge's indignant words were probably the result of his long-accumulated rebelliousness. Otherwise, how could he dare to stand up under the long-standing majesty of the King of Lishui?</p><p></p><p>In a simple courtyard in the capital...</p><p></p><p>"Grandma! When I was in the cellar, I had a silver coin, but I don't know where it went. Have you seen it?"</p><p></p><p>Little Tong rushed out, asking urgently.</p><p></p><p>The old woman, who had been frowning in the courtyard, was startled and quickly stood up with the help of her cane, tears streaming down her face: "Little Tong, you've finally woken up! You've been unconscious for several days, scaring your grandma to death!"</p><p></p><p>Little Tong frowned, quickly running to the old woman's side to support her. She asked with a frown, "Grandma, I've been unconscious for several days? What happened... Oh, has the demonic calamity passed?"</p><p></p><p>She couldn't remember much of what had happened. How strange.</p><p></p><p>"The demonic calamity has passed. At that time, a gentleman..."</p><p></p><p>The old woman, thinking that Little Tong's mind was still unclear from the long unconsciousness, simply recounted the events at the time.</p><p></p><p>A gentleman?</p><p></p><p>Little Tong furrowed her brow, trying to remember. For some reason, an image of a figure in blue robes gradually became clearer in her mind.</p><p></p><p>Suddenly, she had a flash of insight, and she urgently asked, "Grandma, was that gentleman wearing blue robes?"</p><p></p><p>The old woman smiled and nodded, "That's right, it seems you've remembered some of it."</p><p></p><p>Little Tong's mouth opened slightly, her expression surprised. She racked her brain but couldn't recall any more details. She was a bit uncertain.</p><p></p><p>Then she subconsciously asked, "Grandma, did you see a silver coin at that time..."</p><p></p><p>"A silver coin?" The old woman recalled the scene of Lu Changsheng summoning the silver coin into his hand, and said, "That silver coin..."</p><p></p><p>The old woman suddenly fell silent.</p><p></p><p>Because a young man in blue robes had entered the courtyard, and he calmly opened his hand, saying, "Is this the silver coin you're looking for?"</p>

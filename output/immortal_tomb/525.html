        <h1>Chapter 525</h1>
        <div class="content">
            <p>Here is the full English translation of the Chinese excerpt:</p><p></p><p>Zhang Shuihui's complexion did not look very good either.</p><p></p><p>Of course, she knew that Mr. Lu in front of her had a considerable background, otherwise how could her husband and the other two clan elders and the town lord treat him with such reverence.</p><p></p><p>It was precisely because she knew these things that she spoke so politely!</p><p></p><p>And as Xuan'er's mother, what was wrong with that kind of statement?</p><p></p><p>She was simply acting as Xuan'er's mother, considering Xuan'er's future prospects and making preparations.</p><p></p><p>If he had a martial bloodline, he should naturally enter the Tianwu Sect, what use was studying?</p><p></p><p>In the future, even if he passed the entrance exam of the Beidou Academy and became a book cultivator, the prospects would still be bleak.</p><p></p><p>"Mrs. Huang, as Huang Xuan's mother, it is only natural for you to consider his future prospects." Lu Changsheng smiled slightly: "When the Tianwu Sect arrives, you can take Huang Xuan to get his martial bloodline tested. If Huang Xuan has a martial bloodline, I will naturally respect your decision."</p><p></p><p>Lu Changsheng was indifferent about this.</p><p></p><p>He couldn't possibly slam his fist on the table, unleash an unmatched aura, and make Huang Xuan's mother understand how powerful he was.</p><p></p><p>As he said, everything was a matter of fate.</p><p></p><p>His fifteen students could all go and get their martial bloodlines tested, it was their own right.</p><p></p><p>Whether they stayed or left, Lu Changsheng would not say another word.</p><p></p><p>There was nothing to say.</p><p></p><p>These were ordinary people, whether they could grasp the true opportunity of a carp turning into a dragon, it was up to them, he would not interfere with their choices.</p><p></p><p>What status and position did Lu Changsheng have, how could he possibly make any efforts to retain them?</p><p></p><p>Talents were everywhere, even if it was just a domestic pig, as long as Lu Changsheng was willing, he could enlighten it to become a divine being.</p><p></p><p>Anyway, he had already given the opportunity, how to choose was up to others.</p><p></p><p>In fact, Lu Changsheng had previously revealed a bit of the secrets of book cultivation to his students, and then deliberately moved the discussion about book cultivation to after the family visit, precisely because of the arrival of the Tianwu Sect.</p><p></p><p>His fifteen students all had martial bloodlines!</p><p></p><p>This was a small test for Lu Changsheng.</p><p></p><p>Let the students who enter the Tianwu Sect enter the Tianwu Sect, they will have nothing to do with Lu Changsheng afterwards.</p><p></p><p>But the students who remain will be Lu Changsheng's true students.</p><p></p><p>When the time comes, he will impart the Dao of Books.</p><p></p><p>Zhang Shuihui glanced cautiously at the gloomy-faced Huang Yulang, then bitterly smiled: "Okay, thank you Mr. Lu for your understanding."</p><p></p><p>At this moment, Huang Xuan lowered his head, not daring to look at Lu Changsheng.</p><p></p><p>Huang Yulang's breathing was heavy, and he had lost his appetite, extremely disappointed with Zhang Shuihui!</p><p></p><p>It was really without a shred of foresight!!</p><p></p><p>He understood that Zhang Shuihui was considering Xuan'er, but why did she have to say that at the banquet?</p><p></p><p>It was really brainless, not leaving any room for backup!</p><p></p><p>If Huang Xuan did not have a martial bloodline, what would become of Huang Xuan!</p><p></p><p>Just now, was she not treating Lu Changsheng's Changsheng Academy as a place where one could come and go as they pleased?</p><p></p><p>Lu Changsheng was a master of the Dao of Books, yet he was insulted by a mere woman!</p><p></p><p>Yes, in Huang Yulang's eyes, that was an insult!</p><p></p><p>Fortunately, Lu Changsheng did not argue with ordinary people, otherwise this foolish woman would not even know how she died!</p><p></p><p>"Get out! Get out of here!" </p><p></p><p>Suddenly, Huang Yulang could no longer endure it, pointing at Zhang Shuihui and shouting.</p><p></p><p>He did not want to see her now, out of sight, out of mind, and also to keep her from wandering around in front of Lu Changsheng.</p><p></p><p>The hall fell silent, and the servants knelt on the ground in fear.</p><p></p><p>Zhang Shuihui's eyes trembled, looking at Huang Yulang in disbelief, and then felt aggrieved in her heart, took out a handkerchief and left the scene sobbing.</p><p></p><p>After a moment of silence, Lu Changsheng shook his head and sighed lightly: "Clan Leader Huang, there is no need for that. A mother's concern for her son is only natural."</p><p></p><p>"Huang just simply doesn't like her." Huang Yulang pursed his lips, pouring wine for Lu Changsheng: "Mr. Lu, the family visit today has been..."</p><p></p><p>Here is the full English translation of the Chinese excerpt:</p><p></p><p>Xuan'er's mother was upset, don't take it to heart, Huang will punish himself by drinking three cups.</p><p></p><p>After saying that, he gulped down three cups in a row.</p><p></p><p>...</p><p></p><p>After a simple meal, Lu Changsheng left the Huang family with Huang Yulang and his son seeing him off.</p><p></p><p>Soon, Lu Changsheng arrived at the home of the next student, Ye Xiaoxiao.</p><p></p><p>Ye Xiaoxiao's home, although not as grand as the Huang family, was also in good condition.</p><p></p><p>Lu Changsheng's sudden arrival found Ye Xiaoxiao's parents not at home.</p><p></p><p>"Teacher, the student did not know you would visit our home today, my parents are not here."</p><p></p><p>Ye Xiaoxiao poured a cup of tea for Lu Changsheng and sat there timidly, head lowered, playing with her fingers.</p><p></p><p>Lu Changsheng took a sip of tea and smiled, "Xiaoxiao, since your parents are not here, then today I shall have a heart-to-heart talk with you."</p><p></p><p>Ye Xiaoxiao nodded, her heart tense, wishing her parents were here, facing the teacher alone was really a huge pressure, her palms sweating.</p><p></p><p>"I've noticed that you seem more reclusive than the other students, why is that?"</p><p></p><p>Lu Changsheng asked softly.</p><p></p><p>Ye Xiaoxiao spoke in a low voice, "Teacher, Xiaoxiao has always been a shy person who doesn't like to talk to people..."</p><p></p><p>"Oh?" Lu Changsheng smiled faintly, "But I remember you used to call Han Yue 'little black donkey' quite enthusiastically, was I mistaken?"</p><p></p><p>Ye Xiaoxiao's ears reddened as she spoke in a voice like a mosquito, "Teacher, Xiaoxiao did not mean to mock Han Yue, I was just calling him affectionately..."</p><p></p><p>Lu Changsheng smiled and suddenly pursed his lips, "Do you know that the Tianwu Sect is coming to Jixiang Town soon?"</p><p></p><p>"I know."</p><p></p><p>"If you have a martial arts aptitude, what would you do?"</p><p></p><p>"In response to the teacher, even if I have a martial arts aptitude, Xiaoxiao does not want to cultivate the martial way, Xiaoxiao wants to one day be able to enter the Beidou Academy and become a scholar."</p><p></p><p>Saying this, Ye Xiaoxiao's small face was filled with determination and aspiration.</p><p></p><p>Lu Changsheng nodded slightly.</p><p></p><p>In the hearts of almost all students and parents, the school is just a transitional place to lay the foundation, the real place with the hope of becoming a scholar is the academy, like the Beidou Academy in the capital.</p><p></p><p>"If you have a martial arts aptitude, would your parents want you to go to the Tianwu Sect?" Lu Changsheng asked curiously.</p><p></p><p>"Xiaoxiao won't go, Xiaoxiao doesn't like the martial way." Ye Xiaoxiao shook her head repeatedly.</p><p></p><p>"Hehe, okay, then I'll go visit the next student."</p><p></p><p>Lu Changsheng smiled as he stood up.</p><p></p><p>"Okay, Xiaoxiao will see you off."</p><p></p><p>...</p><p></p><p>Over the next two days, Lu Changsheng went to the homes of the other twelve students in Jixiang Town, all of whom gave him a warm welcome. After a casual chat, he left.</p><p></p><p>Lu Changsheng looked at the sky, the sunset was setting, and he walked towards the outskirts of the town.</p><p></p><p>As he walked, his figure gradually became blurred.</p><p></p><p>But the many passers-by on the street seemed not to have noticed this, and continued with their own business.</p><p></p><p>...</p><p></p><p>Outside Jixiang Town, there were a few small villages.</p><p></p><p>Lu Changsheng appeared in a small village ten li south of Jixiang Town.</p><p></p><p>The small village was very quiet, a glance showed only about a dozen households, with a few of them already having wisps of smoke rising from the chimneys.</p><p></p><p>Lu Changsheng saw two large and one small figures bending over and busy with something in the mud, and he smiled and called out, "Han Yue."</p><p></p><p>The next moment, he saw the two large and one small figures stand up, look around in bewilderment, and then the small figure ran over happily, calling out, "Teacher!"</p>

        <h1>Chapter 435</h1>
        <div class="content">
            <p>Here is the full English translation of the excerpt from the Chinese novel:</p><p></p><p>As soon as Lu Changsheng took his seat, Yun Zeao returned to his seat, smiling and saying, "Everyone, let's drink and enjoy the dance!"</p><p></p><p>"Yes, Your Majesty!" </p><p></p><p>The officials quickly responded.</p><p></p><p>The banquet then officially began, and the officials chatted and enjoyed themselves. However, the corner of everyone's eyes in the hall kept stealing glances at the young man in blue robes who was quietly drinking and watching the dance.</p><p></p><p>The old turtle sat behind Lu Changsheng, his eyes shining as he watched the dancing girls, occasionally glimpsing the white skin revealed by the swaying robes. He nodded his head from time to time, seemingly evaluating them in his mind.</p><p></p><p>To be honest, the beauties in the royal palace were indeed quite good, although not much different from those in the Wanhua Garden, and even a little inferior. But the palace beauties had one advantage - they lacked a hint of worldliness.</p><p></p><p>Thinking of this, the old turtle suddenly beckoned to Ye Xunwang.</p><p></p><p>Ye Xunwang, who was constantly keeping an eye on Lu Changsheng's side, naturally noticed it immediately and quickly went to the old turtle's side. "Senior Turtle, what are your orders?"</p><p></p><p>"Hehe." The old turtle first let out a flirtatious laugh, then said solemnly, "Little Ye, Grandpa Turtle thinks that dancing girl is quite good, both in her dance and her looks."</p><p></p><p>As the old turtle spoke, his gaze indicated the lead dancer in the sheer veil.</p><p></p><p>Ye Xunwang paused for a moment, then followed the old turtle's line of sight and immediately understood. He then transmitted a message, "Senior Turtle, don't worry. As soon as the banquet is over, I will arrange for that dancer to meet you..."</p><p></p><p>Hearing this, the old turtle stroked his beard and looked at Ye Xunwang approvingly, "The child is educable."</p><p></p><p>"Hehe," Ye Xunwang laughed awkwardly.</p><p></p><p>At the same time, </p><p></p><p>After clinking cups with the Prime Minister Zhang Dao, Wind Changsheng glanced in the direction of Lu Changsheng, saying meaningfully, "Prime Minister Zhang, this person is..."</p><p></p><p>Zhang Dao's hand holding the cup paused, then he smiled calmly and said, "Crown Prince, that gentleman... I don't know him either, I only know he is an honored guest of ours in Yunlan, and the King and Lord Ye both hold him in high regard."</p><p></p><p>Honored guest? </p><p></p><p>Wind Changsheng gave a cold smile. It shouldn't be just an honored guest, right? </p><p></p><p>Judging from Yun Zeao's earlier behavior, this was no simple honored guest. Yun Zeao's attitude towards him was one of deep respect.</p><p></p><p>Even in the face of Wind Changsheng, the Crown Prince, Yun Zeao's attitude was not as respectful.</p><p></p><p>While Wind Changsheng was curious about the identity of the young man in blue robes, he also had the desire to converse with him.</p><p></p><p>No matter what, a person who could make Yun Zeao show such an attitude must have some background. </p><p></p><p>If he could befriend this person, it would only bring benefits and no harm.</p><p></p><p>Moreover, the Fengluan Ancient Kingdom was now in its heyday, and Wind Changsheng believed this young man would be more than happy to befriend the Crown Prince.</p><p></p><p>Wind Changsheng made up his mind, then smiled and said, "Prime Minister, please continue to enjoy your drink. I will go and have a chat with this gentleman."</p><p></p><p>As Wind Changsheng spoke, he filled his cup and then walked over.</p><p></p><p>Yun Zeao was just about to lead the officials in toasting Lu Changsheng, when he saw Wind Changsheng heading towards Lu Changsheng with a cup, and his heart skipped a beat!</p><p></p><p>What is this Wind Changsheng up to?</p><p></p><p>Yun Zeao instinctively wanted to stop him, but in such a short distance, Wind Changsheng had already reached Lu Changsheng in the blink of an eye, and it was too late.</p><p></p><p>Ye Xunwang, Yun Daoxie, and the others frowned and their heartbeats quickened. </p><p></p><p>They did not expect Wind Changsheng to suddenly make this move.</p><p></p><p>After the initial worry, Yun Daoxie suddenly thought of something, and his eyes gradually narrowed. Wind Changsheng, you'd better not court death, or you might offend the gentleman.</p><p></p><p>At this moment, the entire hall had fallen silent, with only the soft music echoing through the hall.</p><p></p><p>The dancers noticed the change and quietly retreated.</p><p></p><p>Wind Changsheng approached Lu Changsheng, first sizing him up, then holding his cup and arrogantly said, "I am Wind Changsheng, the Crown Prince of the Fengluan Ancient Kingdom. May I ask your esteemed name?"</p><p></p><p>The old turtle saw that Lu Changsheng's cup was empty, and quickly came over to refill it.</p><p></p><p>Lu Changsheng raised the cup and took a light sip, then indifferently said, "The dance was going so well, why did it stop?"</p><p></p><p>From beginning to end, Lu Changsheng's gaze never fell on the Wind Changsheng standing before him, as if the person in front of him was not a person, but just a wisp of air.</p><p></p><p>Yun Zeao's face paled at this, and he immediately shouted angrily, "Outrageous! Where are the dancers? Who told you to stop? Hurry up and continue dancing!"</p><p></p><p>The dancers...</p><p></p><p>Here is the full English translation of the Chinese excerpt:</p><p></p><p>Trembling and shaking, she emerged from the corner and continued to dance to the rhythm of the vocal music, but the dance had become extremely stiff, completely losing its previous beauty.</p><p></p><p>It was clear that they had become very nervous, and could not even dance well.</p><p></p><p>Seeing the dancers in this state, Yunze Cang's heart was filled with silent anger and urgency, but he was unable to do anything about it for the time being, and could only carefully look towards the young man in blue robes.</p><p></p><p>As for Feng Changxuan, after a moment of dazed silence, a look of shame and anger appeared in his eyes as he gazed at Lu Changsheng!!</p><p></p><p>This person actually had the audacity to ignore the Crown Prince of Fengluan in front of the King of Yunlan and many officials!!</p><p></p><p>He didn't even bother to look at him......</p><p></p><p>Feng Changxuan's chest heaved with anger, but out of fear of not knowing the other's background, he did not dare to act rashly for the moment.</p><p></p><p>However, it was impossible for him to just retreat like this, he had to regain control of the situation!</p><p></p><p>Otherwise, if this incident were to spread, it would have a negative impact on his and the Fengluan's reputation.</p><p></p><p>So Feng Changxuan took a deep breath and, looking at Lu Changsheng again, raised his cup and said in a deep voice:</p><p></p><p>"I am the Crown Prince of the ancient Fengluan Kingdom, Feng Changxuan. May I ask how you address yourself?"</p><p></p><p>At this moment, anyone could sense Feng Changxuan's anger!</p><p></p><p>Everyone in the hall was startled and on edge.</p><p></p><p>"Bang."</p><p></p><p>Lu Changsheng suddenly gently placed his cup on the table.</p><p></p><p>Old Turtle saw this and his body trembled, instantly understanding, and abruptly stood up, glaring at Feng Changxuan and coldly saying:</p><p></p><p>"What fly dares to buzz in front of the master?"</p><p></p><p>The atmosphere in the hall instantly became tense, and everyone's nerves were on edge! The development of the situation seemed to be going in an unfavorable direction......</p><p></p><p>Feng Changxuan paused, looking at Old Turtle in disbelief, never imagining that he would dare to call him a fly?</p><p></p><p>He was the Crown Prince of Fengluan now!!</p><p></p><p>"Outrageous!! How dare you insult the Crown Prince of our country!"</p><p></p><p>At this moment, the two warriors accompanying Feng Changxuan suddenly stood up, and the pressure of their Shenxiubound aura erupted!</p><p></p><p>Two Shenxiubound experts!</p><p></p><p>Yun Aoye and the others were shocked.</p><p></p><p>Yunze Cang abruptly stood up, about to take some action......</p><p></p><p>"What trash, daring to bark like a dog!"</p><p></p><p>Old Turtle let out a disdainful cold shout and slapped his hand out!</p><p></p><p>Bang——!</p><p></p><p>The two warriors had not even made a move when they were slapped into a bloody mess, their blood splattering across the hall!</p><p></p><p>Everyone was stunned on the spot, and soon their hearts were trembling - the two warriors of the Fengluan Kingdom had died in Yunlan......</p><p></p><p>Feng Changxuan's face had turned deathly pale, his figure retreating while he wavered unsteadily,</p><p></p><p>"You...you actually dare to kill my Fengluan warriors, I, the Fengluan Kingdom, have Shenlingbound existences, and when I return to the country and report this matter, you Yunlan... will await your destruction!"</p><p></p><p>Hearing this, Yunze Cang and the others paused, but did not say anything.</p><p></p><p>Feng Changxuan quickly thought of a solution and suddenly looked at Yunze Cang, shouting:</p><p></p><p>"Your Majesty, as long as you apprehend these two, my marriage with Kaning will proceed as scheduled, and I, Fengluan, will never set foot in Yunlan!"</p><p></p><p>Hearing this, Yexin Mo, Yun Aoye, and even Kaning, who were somewhat familiar with Lu Changsheng's strength, held their breath, their faces paling slightly, and they all looked at Yunze Cang!</p><p></p><p>Your Majesty, the young man in blue robes is someone we cannot provoke, please think carefully!</p><p></p><p>Zhang Dao and the other officials also looked at Yunze Cang!</p><p></p><p>Your Majesty, the Fengluan Kingdom is someone we cannot provoke, please think carefully!</p><p></p><p>The two sides had completely different thoughts!</p><p></p><p>After Feng Changxuan finished speaking, Old Turtle looked at Yunze Cang with mockery.</p><p></p><p>As for Yunze Cang, he had no hesitation at all, and decisively waved his hand:</p><p></p><p>"Bring the enemy Crown Prince to the dungeon and await further orders!!"</p><p></p><p>Feng Changxuan staggered, looking at Yunze Cang in disbelief.</p><p></p><p>"Why? Why?"</p><p></p><p>At this moment, Lu Changsheng stood up and walked out of the hall under the awe-filled gazes of many, soon disappearing from the sight of the crowd.</p><p></p><p>Old Turtle looked at Feng Changxuan and sneered, "Why? You will soon understand."</p><p></p><p>Old Turtle finished speaking and looked at Yexin Mo meaningfully before leaving the hall.</p>

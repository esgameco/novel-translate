        <h1>Chapter 281</h1>
        <div class="content">
            <p>Here is the full English translation of the Chinese excerpt:</p><p></p><p>"Swoosh, swoosh, swoosh!"</p><p></p><p>The azure sword qi was as powerful as ever, seeming to sweep away all things in the world. </p><p></p><p>Ouyang Zui was completely panicked, utterly panicked!</p><p></p><p>At this moment, he was firmly locked down by the terrifying sword qi!</p><p></p><p>"Who! Who is it! Who is it!!!"</p><p></p><p>Ouyang Zui stared fixatedly at the sword qi, howling.</p><p></p><p>But this space was now deathly silent, only his howls and the sword's piercing wail.</p><p></p><p>The crowd had all become dumbfounded, their minds blank.</p><p></p><p>Ouyang Zui's heart was in turmoil. He hastily activated his elemental force, and the two suns behind him burned ever brighter and more dazzling!</p><p></p><p>From the way that sword qi had easily cleaved through his scorching aura just now, he could tell that the hidden person was very strong, stronger than him!</p><p></p><p>Likely a late-stage Saint Yang cultivator!</p><p></p><p>And... also a sword cultivator at the late-stage Saint Yang realm!</p><p></p><p>Among cultivators of the same level, sword cultivators were inherently stronger in combat, let alone when the opponent was not even at the same level!</p><p></p><p>Thinking of this, Ouyang Zui couldn't help but feel resentment.</p><p></p><p>Why, why, why!</p><p></p><p>Why, just when he had finally broken through to the middle Saint Yang realm and was preparing to unfold his grand plans, preparing to venture to other places in the Ancient Wasteland to pursue even higher realms, did this powerful expert appear in Thundercloud City!</p><p></p><p>Why!</p><p></p><p>Ouyang Zui was filled with rage.</p><p></p><p>He took a deep breath, simultaneously forming seals while madly retreating, trying to buy himself more time to cast a spell!</p><p></p><p>The movements of his hand seals were almost like an illusion.</p><p></p><p>At a certain moment, his body suddenly halted, his hands spreading open, and to the horror of the onlookers, the two suns behind Ouyang Zui actually moved, floating to hover between his hands!!</p><p></p><p>The next instant, Ouyang Zui viciously hurled the scorching suns forward!</p><p></p><p>"Saint Yang Art - Twin Blazing Suns!"</p><p></p><p>Whoosh-</p><p></p><p>The two suns rapidly expanded, truly resembling miniature suns. They erupted with golden light and an immense scorching wave, spiraling towards the sword cultivator!</p><p></p><p>In this space, a fierce golden-yellow heat wave storm was whipped up, the very space distorting, its momentum seemingly far exceeding that of the sword qi.</p><p></p><p>The crowd was gripped by terror - this was the power of the middle Saint Yang realm! The terrifying might of the two suns!</p><p></p><p>If Ouyang Zui had not focused all his power on that ancient long sword at this moment, then under the onslaught of these two suns, not a single person in the entire Thundercloud City would have survived.</p><p></p><p>However, in the next instant!</p><p></p><p>The two suns were cleaved in half, cut as easily as slicing through iron, without the slightest hesitation.</p><p></p><p>In that moment, Ouyang Zui violently coughed up a mouthful of black blood, his figure stumbling back thousands of feet before collapsing to his knees, his eyes instantly dimming.</p><p></p><p>As the mighty suns of a Saint Yang cultivator were annihilated, it could be said that he was now ruined.</p><p></p><p>"Great one, show yourself, so that this old man can die with clarity!!" </p><p></p><p>Ouyang Zui no longer looked at the approaching long sword, instead scanning the surroundings with great difficulty and roaring.</p><p></p><p>Alas, no one responded.</p><p></p><p>Ouyang Zui shook his head and smiled bitterly, his face filled with resentment and malice. In the end, he was simply not strong enough!</p><p></p><p>If he had been strong enough, the one dying today would have been that hidden rat, not him!!</p><p></p><p>Just then, the sword qi slashed across his body!!</p><p></p><p>Ouyang Zui's body suddenly trembled, his expression first freezing, then relaxing.</p><p></p><p>Afterwards, before the trembling gazes of the crowd, his body split in two and disintegrated into particles.</p><p></p><p>"Ances...tor!" </p><p></p><p>The members of the Ouyang Clan turned deathly pale, unwilling to believe this sight before them, unable to accept it.</p><p></p><p>It was too fast, far too fast.</p><p></p><p>The ancestor who had been dominating the crowd just a moment ago had now fallen in this manner.</p><p></p><p>Here is the full English translation of the Chinese excerpt:</p><p></p><p>In this space, everyone had a numb expression on their face.</p><p></p><p>The mid-stage of the Divine Sun Realm! To be slain by a single sword strike...</p><p></p><p>Sitting on the ground, Liu Qing and the Liu Clan's Patriarch also had a grim expression. They had just experienced the terrifying power of Ouyang Zui.</p><p></p><p>Even if they had joined forces, they were almost defeated in just a few moves by Ouyang Zui, who was merely toying with them. If he had been serious, they wouldn't have stood a chance.</p><p></p><p>Just who...</p><p></p><p>At this moment,</p><p></p><p>The Severing Void Sword swiftly flew back towards Li Shuyan's direction, emitting a blue glow!</p><p></p><p>This startled Li Shuyan and the others, including Fu Liangcai, causing them to break out in a cold sweat.</p><p></p><p>Li Shuyan trembled as he tried to aim the sword sheath at the Severing Void Sword, but the sword's speed was simply too fast, too terrifying!</p><p></p><p>Just as the Severing Void Sword appeared a few dozen feet away from Li Shuyan and the others,</p><p></p><p>A figure in green robes wearing a bronze mask slowly emerged, effortlessly grasping the Severing Void Sword and saying, "Your playfulness has gone too far."</p><p></p><p>The Severing Void Sword trembled in fear.</p><p></p><p>Lu Changsheng inwardly sneered, this broken sword actually had the intention of approaching the old turtle.</p><p></p><p>He then swung the Severing Void Sword towards Li Shuyan, and with a "clink" sound, the sword precisely sheathed itself.</p><p></p><p>"Senior!"</p><p>Li Shuyan hurriedly held the sword and bowed.</p><p></p><p>"Esteemed senior!"</p><p>Fu Liangcai and the others also quickly bowed.</p><p></p><p>Fu Shiyu's heart was pounding, feeling as if it was about to leap out of her throat.</p><p>Because she vaguely felt that the sword's cry just now was somewhat similar to the one she had heard in the void...</p><p></p><p>Some things are better not to dwell on, the more you think about it, the more terrifying it becomes.</p><p></p><p>Involuntarily, her body started to tremble, and her soul shook, on the verge of collapse.</p><p></p><p>Her abnormal state immediately caught the attention of Fu Tao beside her.</p><p></p><p>"Sister?" Fu Tao transmitted a voice, puzzled.</p><p></p><p>Lu Changsheng looked down at Fu Shiyu with a smile, "Patriarch Fu, your daughter seems to be in an unusual state. Is she unwell?"</p><p></p><p>Fu Liangcai was startled, quickly turning his head to look, and sure enough, he saw that Fu Shiyu's condition was not right. He was puzzled and also somewhat panicked.</p><p></p><p>What is Shiyu doing, being so out of place?</p><p></p><p>He hurriedly turned around, wanting to explain with a slightly fearful tone, "Senior, Shiyu, she..."</p><p></p><p>Lu Changsheng waved his hand, looking deeply at Fu Shiyu, and said indifferently, "No matter, let her go and rest."</p><p></p><p>"Yes, yes, the senior is magnanimous!" Fu Liangcai quickly ordered in a low voice, "Tao'er, quickly take your sister and go down!"</p><p></p><p>"Yes, Father." Fu Tao's face turned pale as he bowed respectfully to Lu Changsheng, then carefully led the abnormal Fu Shiyu away.</p><p></p><p>At this moment,</p><p>The space was deathly silent, with countless trembling, fearful, awestruck, and questioning gazes fixed on the figure in green robes.</p><p></p><p>It was obvious that the one who had secretly slain the Ouyang Patriarch with a single sword strike was this bronze-masked man in green!</p><p></p><p>A sword cultivator, able to slay an Ouyang Patriarch at the late stage of the Divine Sun Realm with a single sword strike!</p><p></p><p>The Liu Clan Patriarch and Liu Qing exchanged a trembling glance, then shakily rose to their feet and stumbled towards Lu Changsheng, bowing deeply.</p><p></p><p>"Liu Clan's Liu Tu (Liu Qing) pays respects to the senior!"</p><p></p><p>The two were in a state of panic. If they didn't handle this properly today, the Liu Clan would be doomed!</p><p></p><p>Lu Changsheng did not even glance at the dejected Ouyang Nuo and the others, turning and disappearing in a single step.</p>

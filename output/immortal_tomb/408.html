        <h1>Chapter 408</h1>
        <div class="content">
            <p>Here is the full English translation of the Chinese excerpt:</p><p></p><p>Hmm?</p><p></p><p>Hearing this was clearly the voice of a mature man, Lu Changsheng's brow raised slightly, and then his gaze turned, only to pause abruptly.</p><p></p><p>It was actually a burly man with a beard, and what made Lu Changsheng feel even more absurd was that this burly man was now looking at him shyly......</p><p></p><p>Lu Changsheng simply pretended not to have heard, and with a bewildered expression, the old turtle quickly left!</p><p></p><p>The crowd snapped out of their daze, only to find that Lu Changsheng had already disappeared, and they immediately exploded, criticizing the burly man.</p><p></p><p>"It's all your fault! You scared the Qin Immortal away!"</p><p></p><p>"That's right, that's right, a man like you, even if you have a liking for men, it's not a big deal, but you just had to use such vulgar words to the Qin Immortal in public, that's not okay!"</p><p></p><p>"Hmph, the Qin Immortal is ours, you men are not allowed to interfere!"</p><p></p><p>"The competition was already fierce enough, and I didn't expect there would be men coming to butt in as well, pfft!"</p><p></p><p>"Hey, you look so sturdy and strong, how could you..."</p><p></p><p>"No wonder my Qin Immortal brother is so popular, not only does he attract women, but he also attracts men, truly a man who can captivate both genders. This just shows the unparalleled charm of my Qin Immortal brother."</p><p></p><p>"......"</p><p></p><p>After the girls finished speaking, they quickly ran in the direction where Lu Changsheng had disappeared, and soon they were out of sight as well.</p><p></p><p>As for the men, they were speechless, but they had no objection to the Qin Immortal, after all, they admired the Qin Immortal from the bottom of their hearts.</p><p></p><p>They truly admired the divine musical skills of the Qin Immortal.</p><p></p><p>The melodies he played were so melodious.</p><p></p><p>There is a saying that is very fitting, "This melody should only be heard in the heavens, how could it be heard on earth?"</p><p></p><p>And more importantly, they were able to listen to such wonderful music for free, where else could they find such a good thing?</p><p></p><p>It's not that they wanted to freeload, but the Qin Immortal's demeanor really didn't seem like someone who was short on money.</p><p></p><p>If they were to simply give him money, it might make the Qin Immortal feel uncomfortable.</p><p></p><p>Moreover, the Qin Immortal's sudden appearance in their Tianxiang City was only a recent event.</p><p></p><p>The crowd believed that with the Qin Immortal's musical skills, he would soon become famous.</p><p></p><p>And perhaps their small Tianxiang City would also become famous as a result!</p><p></p><p>At this moment, the burly man was looking at the direction where the girls had disappeared with a lingering fear, muttering, "What's wrong with loving someone? Love should be expressed out loud!"</p><p></p><p>The surrounding men, upon hearing this, turned pale, shuddered, and quickly distanced themselves from the burly man, scattering as if fleeing.</p><p></p><p>The burly man saw this and pouted in disappointment.</p><p></p><p>.........</p><p></p><p>The news of the Qin Immortal's appearance spread rapidly throughout Tianxiang City.</p><p></p><p>But when people learned that the Qin Immortal had finished playing at Youting Lake and left, they felt a sense of disappointment.</p><p></p><p>Damn, it's a huge loss, a huge freaking loss!</p><p></p><p>However, when they learned that the Qin Immortal did not leave immediately after the performance, but instead started to tour Tianxiang City, the crowd immediately perked up.</p><p></p><p>Naturally, in the streets and alleys of Tianxiang City, there were countless people searching for Lu Changsheng.</p><p></p><p>At the same time, in Tianxiang City, at the Zhu Mansion.</p><p></p><p>In a refined courtyard, a woman was sitting calmly, focused on her painting.</p><p></p><p>The woman looked gentle and graceful, with a refined bearing.</p><p></p><p>"Miss, Miss!"</p><p></p><p>At this moment, a maid rushed into the courtyard from outside.</p><p></p><p>Zhu Qingqing's slender hand paused, and she turned her head to look at the panting maid, frowning slightly. "You, I've told you before, when I'm painting, no one is allowed to disturb me, right?"</p><p></p><p>The maid seemed to have caught her breath, and she smiled brightly. "Miss, what if it's about the Qin Immortal?"</p><p></p><p>Zhu Qingqing's eyes flickered, and a glimpse of concealed delight appeared in her gaze. She put down her brush and asked in a slightly hurried tone, "The Qin Immortal? Has he appeared at Youting Lake again?"</p><p></p><p>With that, Zhu Qingqing stood up, intending to head to Youting Lake.</p><p></p><p>Here is the full English translation of the Chinese excerpt:</p><p></p><p>Little Lian hurriedly and awkwardly said, "Miss, the Qin Immortal has finished playing..."</p><p></p><p>Finished playing? </p><p></p><p>That means he has already left.</p><p></p><p>Hearing this, a clear sense of disappointment appeared in Zhu Qingqing's eyes.</p><p></p><p>Seeing this, Little Lian sighed inwardly.</p><p></p><p>In the City of Heavenly Fragrance, there were countless young masters pursuing the Miss, but none of them could stir her heart.</p><p></p><p>Yet this Qin Immortal, with just one piece of music, had captured the Miss's soul.</p><p></p><p>Recently, the Miss had been leisurely wandering around Youting Lake as usual.</p><p></p><p>Everything was normal at first, but when an unfamiliar immortal melody suddenly sounded in her ears, the Miss was stunned.</p><p></p><p>At that time, she and the Miss immediately instructed the boatman to row the boat towards the source of the music, and they witnessed an unforgettable scene.</p><p></p><p>On the banks of Youting Lake, in the spring sunlight and gentle breeze, a young man in green robes was quietly playing the zither, seeming to be aloof from the world.</p><p></p><p>The usually lively and noisy Youting Lake was silenced by the music at that moment. </p><p></p><p>Everyone was immersed in it, all staring in awe at the suddenly arrived Qin Immortal.</p><p></p><p>Since then, the Miss has been unable to forget the Qin Immortal...</p><p></p><p>It was also from that time that Little Lian realized that love at first sight truly exists in this world.</p><p></p><p>Not only the Miss, but even she herself greatly admired the Qin Immortal.</p><p></p><p>The title "Qin Immortal" was the respectful way everyone addressed him, whether it was his extraordinary zither skills or his transcendent appearance in green robes, the name was truly fitting.</p><p></p><p>"Sigh..." Lost in thought, Little Lian unconsciously sighed.</p><p></p><p>Zhu Qingqing looked at her questioningly, "What's wrong?"</p><p></p><p>Little Lian snapped back to her senses, quickly waving her hand, "Nothing, nothing..."</p><p></p><p>In fact, she really wanted to tell the Miss, "Miss, you should give up early. The Qin Immortal probably won't be interested in you. Don't get in too deep."</p><p></p><p>In Little Lian's view, with the Qin Immortal's godly zither skills, he would soon be renowned throughout the Cloud Mist Ancient Kingdom. At that time, even the noble princesses might fall for him.</p><p></p><p>While the Miss's status in the City of Heavenly Fragrance was not low, compared to those ancient kingdom princesses, she was still far behind.</p><p></p><p>And not to mention them, there was also Miss Luo Linyan of the Luo Family, a formidable competitor.</p><p></p><p>The Miss's quiet and reserved personality was no match for the fiery Luo Linyan.</p><p></p><p>Zhu Qingqing gently nodded her head, let out a sigh, and turned to pick up her brush to continue painting.</p><p></p><p>Little Lian's gaze fell on the painting, and sure enough, she saw the figure of the young man in green robes.</p><p></p><p>The Miss was truly bewitched.</p><p></p><p>"Oh yes, Miss, although the Qin Immortal has finished playing, I heard that he hasn't left the City of Heavenly Fragrance this time, but his exact location is unknown. Many people in the city are searching for him."</p><p></p><p>Little Lian said softly.</p><p></p><p>Zhu Qingqing paused, her heart filled with joy, but she put down her brush and said impatiently, "Couldn't you have just said that all at once?"</p><p></p><p>She then got up and hurriedly went out of the courtyard.</p><p></p><p>Little Lian was stunned for a moment, then silently followed behind her. She actually wanted to say, "Miss, there are more people in the city today. Maybe it's better not to go."</p><p></p><p>Meanwhile, at the Luo Residence.</p><p></p><p>After learning the news, Luo Linyan's expression could not hide her delight. With a wave of her hand, she summoned more than a dozen servants and rushed into the city.</p><p></p><p>"Miss... Seeing the Qin Immortal is seeing the Qin Immortal. Why are you bringing so many people with you?" one of the servants asked cautiously.</p><p></p><p>Luo Linyan smiled coquettishly, "Hehe! If that Qin Immortal dares to resist, I'll have him brought back to my chambers!"</p><p></p><p>"..."</p>

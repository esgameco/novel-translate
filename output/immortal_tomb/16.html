        <div class="content">
            <p>Here is the full English translation of the Chinese excerpt:</p><p></p><p>In the eastern region of the Water Separation Empire. ‚òúüç™‚ûÖ‚ùæ—ï–Ωùì§–ñ.Ôº£œÉ‡πì‚ô£üíù</p><p></p><p>When the town lords received the order, they became excited and finally liberated.</p><p></p><p>Facing the pressure from the common people, they could no longer withstand it.</p><p></p><p>In just one day, all the towns in the eastern part of the Empire had gathered the common people, escorted by the military, marching towards the destination - Moyu Town, like a grand ant migration.</p><p></p><p>This scene left the black-tongued demons in each town completely dumbfounded!</p><p></p><p>Where are they going?</p><p></p><p>They were secretly observing, ready to grit their teeth and strike down the military and common people in broad daylight, when suddenly their bodies trembled!</p><p></p><p>They sensed the aura of a powerful cultivator!</p><p></p><p>Looking up at the sky, with their vision, they indeed saw a flowing light rushing towards the imperial capital!</p><p></p><p>At least at the Golden Core realm!</p><p></p><p>So, they could only reluctantly hide, suppressing the evil aura in their bodies to the minimum, preparing to report this matter to the clan leader for judgment.</p><p></p><p>The Golden Core cultivator was not something they could handle.</p><p></p><p>.........</p><p></p><p>"Eh, Master, look there, where are all those common people going?" </p><p></p><p>In the sky, the child pointed at the long column on the ground and asked curiously.</p><p></p><p>Gu Helin glanced over and said, "Never mind them for now, let's first go to the imperial capital to see the King of the Water Separation Empire and understand the situation."</p><p></p><p>"Oh."</p><p></p><p>Swoosh!</p><p></p><p>The two of them disappeared without a trace.</p><p></p><p>When Gu Helin and the child arrived at the royal palace in the imperial capital, they were dumbfounded...</p><p></p><p>Apart from the guards and a few palace maids, there was not a single person in the palace!</p><p></p><p>After questioning the guards, they finally learned what had happened...</p><p></p><p>Gu Helin and the child exchanged a glance, recalling the long column they had seen earlier, and understood.</p><p></p><p>At the same time, doubts arose in their minds.</p><p></p><p>Why did the King of the Water Separation Empire organize the common people to go to the remote Moyu Town? To make it easier for the black-tongued demons to attack?</p><p></p><p>Could it be that moving to Moyu Town would be safe?</p><p></p><p>Even the usually sharp-minded Gu Helin was at a loss.</p><p></p><p>"Master, so what should we do next?" the child asked Gu Helin.</p><p></p><p>Gu Helin's aged eyes flickered, and with a wave of his hand, he interrupted, "Child, you said earlier that the Water Separation Empire currently only has demonic problems in the eastern region, right?"</p><p></p><p>The child nodded, "Yes."</p><p></p><p>"What is their true purpose..." Gu Helin stroked his white beard and pondered.</p><p></p><p>Suddenly, a flash of insight struck his mind!</p><p></p><p>Could it be...</p><p></p><p>"Come, let's secretly escort those common people to Moyu Town!!"</p><p></p><p>Perhaps wanting to verify his guess, Gu Helin grabbed the confused child and disappeared in a flash of light.</p><p></p><p>"Flew, flew, flew... a Immortal, a Immortal!" The palace guard was shocked.</p><p></p><p>Just now, the Immortal had asked him questions, and he didn't kneel down to reply - was that impolite? Would he suffer a shortened lifespan?</p><p></p><p>The guard fell into a state of panic.</p><p></p><p>.........</p><p></p><p>Ten days later.</p><p></p><p>After day and night marching, the main force finally arrived at the Moyu Town region without any incidents.</p><p></p><p>"Your Majesty, strangely, in these ten days, we have not been attacked by any demons. These demons are truly unfathomable," </p><p></p><p>Dong Ge rode his horse to the luxurious carriage of the Water Separation King, smiling respectfully.</p><p></p><p>Inside the luxurious carriage, the Water Separation King smiled contentedly, "This is indeed excellent. It's quite miraculous, ever since we entered this Moyu Town region, the King's tense nerves have relaxed considerably. Truly remarkable! Dong Ge, if what you say is true, that this place is under the protection of a Immortal Tomb, the King will certainly promote and reward you!"</p><p></p><p>Dong Ge's eyes lit up, and he suppressed the excitement in his heart and respectfully said, "Your Majesty, how could I deserve such words. As an old servant, I have only provided some good strategies in the Empire's time of crisis. It is my duty to serve the King, to bear the King's worries. These are all things I should do."</p><p></p><p>"Haha, good! Dong Ge, the King has indeed not misjudged you! Well then, the promotion and reward can wait for now! Between us, the King and the subject, to bring up such vulgar matters would be to damage our feelings. The King feels ashamed."</p><p></p><p>The Water Separation King shook his head and sighed.</p><p></p><p>"Uh..." Dong Ge was dumbfounded, and then quickly wanted to say something...</p><p></p><p>The middle-aged official riding in front turned his head and smiled:</p><p></p><p>New</p><p></p><p>Here is the full English translation of the Chinese excerpt:</p><p></p><p>"Your Majesty! We will soon arrive at Moyu Town!" </p><p></p><p>"Haha, good! Go and send messages to the southern, western, and northern regions. Report any abnormalities immediately!"</p><p></p><p>The King of the Lishui Empire opened the carriage curtain and smiled at the small town ahead.</p><p></p><p>"Yes."</p><p></p><p>At the same time, high above the main army.</p><p></p><p>Guchelin and Tongxin sat on a flying carpet, silently looking at the small town ahead.</p><p></p><p>"Master, for the past ten days, why has the Black Tongue Demon not attacked these civilians? This should be a good opportunity." Tongxin asked puzzledly.</p><p></p><p>Guchelin shook his head and sighed, "That day, I was careless. When I arrived in the Lishui Empire, I forgot to suppress the aura around me, and I fear the Black Tongue Demons may have detected it."</p><p></p><p>Tongxin was stunned, so that was the reason. He then continued to wonder, "Then Master, why haven't the Black Tongue Demons been harming the southern, western, and northern regions of the Lishui Empire for the past ten days? Why are they only focused on the eastern part?"</p><p></p><p>Guchelin was slightly surprised, and he looked at Tongxin with a rare smile, "You've grown up!"</p><p></p><p>Tongxin laughed awkwardly, "Of course."</p><p></p><p>Guchelin frowned for a moment, his gaze following the Moyu Town and looking towards the hazy clouds in the distance beyond the border, worrying, "Based on the abnormal behavior of the Black Tongue Demons, combined with my keen intelligence, these Black Tongue Demons... or rather, the intentions behind them, may not be just for wine."</p><p></p><p>"Master means, they have other schemes!" Tongxin exclaimed with a loud clap.</p><p></p><p>Pah! Guchelin suddenly gave him a heavy slap on the head, quite speechless, "I've already said that, isn't that just stating the obvious!"</p><p></p><p>Tongxin covered his painful head, crying inwardly. It hurt, it hurt so much.</p><p></p><p>"Alright, let's just watch and see what the King of the Lishui Empire intends to do by moving the eastern civilians to this place," Guchelin said indifferently.</p><p></p><p>Tongxin immediately stopped the flying carpet in the air, then he and Guchelin silently watched below.</p><p></p><p>But just then!! Guchelin's expression changed drastically!! Tongxin's face also turned deathly pale!!!</p><p></p><p>An overwhelming, powerful force descended from nowhere, suddenly enveloping them both, carpet and all, and plunging them downwards!!!</p><p></p><p>Guchelin's expression was shaken, frantically surging his spiritual energy to resist this mighty force, but no matter how he tried, it was useless! </p><p></p><p>Facing this powerful force, he felt like a small drop of water, hopelessly trying to contend with the vast ocean!</p><p></p><p>How, how could this be?! This was the true reflection of Guchelin's inner thoughts at the moment!</p><p></p><p>"Master, what's happening? We won't just die miserably from this fall, right?" Tongxin asked fearfully.</p><p></p><p>Guchelin's face had also turned pale. He, the great Immortal Guchelin, about to advance to the Yuan Ying stage, if he were to die from a high-altitude fall, that would become the biggest joke in the Immortal Cultivation world!</p><p></p><p>"Ah!!!"</p><p></p><p>Under this tremendous impact, Tongxin finally couldn't hold back and let out a loud cry!</p><p></p><p>At the same time,</p><p></p><p>Under the enthusiastic welcome of Chen Dadao and the steward, the King of the Lishui Empire and his officials were just about to enter the town when they all suddenly changed expression, simultaneously looking up at the sky.</p><p></p><p>The guards also quickly drew their swords, warily surveying their surroundings.</p><p></p><p>What was that agonizing scream just now? Could it be that as soon as they arrived at this Moyu Town, they would have to deal with demonic troubles?</p><p></p><p>The faces of the group were as if they had eaten shit.</p><p></p><p>But Chen Dadao and the steward remained calm. With the Master here, how could there be any demonic troubles? And that was clearly a human voice, no need to be so alarmed!</p><p></p><p>They then politely ushered the still-shaken King of the Lishui Empire and the others into Moyu Town.</p><p></p><p>In the backyard of the Town Lord's mansion.</p><p></p><p>Tongxin and Guchelin had halted just before hitting the ground, then gently landed. </p><p></p><p>The two quickly stood up and looked around, their expressions filled with extreme fear and alertness!</p><p></p><p>What had just happened was truly terrifying, that feeling of having no control over their own lives, it was too horrifying, too desperate!</p><p></p><p>"You two, we meet again."</p><p></p><p>Suddenly, a gentle voice reached their ears, causing Guchelin and Tongxin to suddenly stiffen!</p><p></p><p>They quickly looked towards the pavilion, </p><p></p><p>and there, an azure-robed man was sitting there, quietly drinking wine...</p><p></p><p>Guchelin and Tongxin were startled, their movements perfectly synchronized!</p><p></p><p>But just now, there was no one there...!</p>

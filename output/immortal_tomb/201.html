        <h1>Chapter 201</h1>
        <div class="content">
            <p>Here is the full English translation of the Chinese excerpt:</p><p></p><p>Woo woo‚Äî</p><p></p><p>In the extreme cold ice field, the icy wind whirled the rolling ice mist, bitterly cold. ‚ôúüç™6‚ûà‚ì¢·ïºùêÆ‚ìß.Âåö‚ìû–º‚ôóüòà</p><p></p><p>In the ice mist, a figure approached from afar, and after a moment, the figure in blue gradually became clearer.</p><p></p><p>Lu Changsheng paused his steps, his gaze sweeping across the hundreds of huge scarlet eyes staring at him from the ice mist, then he smiled and said, "You beasts, do you think I'm an easy target since I'm alone?"</p><p></p><p>Seemingly provoked by Lu Changsheng, </p><p></p><p>the next moment, a fierce beast roar similar to a tiger's howl rang out!</p><p></p><p>Roar!</p><p></p><p>Hundreds of fierce beasts then surged out from the ice mist, apparently intending to attack Lu Changsheng!</p><p></p><p>These fierce beasts were as large as small mountains, their bodies pulsing with strange white ice flames, their limbs thick and powerful, their sharp claws gleaming with a cold light!</p><p></p><p>Ice Flame Tigers!</p><p></p><p>One of the native fierce beasts of the extreme cold ice field!</p><p></p><p>Any one of them could make even a Ninth-Grade Sect tremble in fear!</p><p></p><p>In this extreme cold ice field, countless cultivators had perished in their jaws.</p><p></p><p>However, their biggest weakness was their low intelligence, so as long as one could take advantage of this, there was a chance to escape.</p><p></p><p>With a smile on his face, Lu Changsheng simply moved his spiritual sense, and these hundreds of Ice Flame Tigers suddenly froze, as if they had been placed under a paralysis spell.</p><p></p><p>The scarlet beast eyes of the Ice Flame Tigers dimmed, and their gazes became much clearer at this moment.</p><p></p><p>Soon, their gazes turned to terror!</p><p></p><p>Even though their intelligence was not high, they knew that the person before them was up to some tricks.</p><p></p><p>What was going on? They had eaten so many cultivators who had come in groups before, yet the cultivator in front of them was so powerful.</p><p></p><p>Lu Changsheng smiled, a long sword appearing in his hand, and he went over and chopped off a tiger's leg, then left without caring about these little beasts, dragging the tiger's leg along.</p><p></p><p>......</p><p></p><p>Not long after he left,</p><p></p><p>four more people passed through the ice mist and arrived at this place.</p><p></p><p>They were the four Thunderbolt Disciples of the Great Sun Thunder Sect.</p><p></p><p>"Uh, these are Ice Flame Tigers?" Seeing the scene before them, Leiyu's pupils contracted.</p><p></p><p>The two Elders behind him, Zhao Hufaand Lin Hufa, slowly nodded, and Zhao Hufa said in a solemn voice, "The Junior Sect Master was right, these are indeed Ice Flame Tigers... But judging from their posture, it seems they have been restrained by a powerful cultivator."</p><p></p><p>Hearing this, Leitingwas slightly surprised. "These hundreds of Ice Flame Tigers could easily devour the same number of Ninth-Grade Sects..."</p><p></p><p>Leiyu nodded gravely. To be honest, he, as the Junior Sect Master of the Great Sun Thunder Sect, and Leiting, the Holy Maiden, would not be able to deal with these hundreds of Ice Flame Tigers.</p><p></p><p>Moreover, these Ice Flame Tigers had all been frozen alive, which meant that the person they had faced before... was extremely powerful!</p><p></p><p>Much stronger than him and Leiting!</p><p></p><p>"Elders, this should have been caused by a single person, right?" Leiyu asked, his gaze flickering as he scanned the Ice Flame Tigers.</p><p></p><p>Elder Lin's wrinkled face opened up in a smile as he said, "The Junior Sect Master is correct, this was indeed caused by a single person."</p><p></p><p>Hearing this, Leiyu's gaze grew solemn. "Then can the two Elders also immobilize these Ice Flame Tigers?"</p><p></p><p>"Hehe, this is naturally something we can do. Immobilizing these Ice Flame Tigers for half an hour would be no difficulty for the two of us..." Zhao Hufa chuckled, but then his expression suddenly turned serious as he narrowed his eyes and said, "However, after casting the immobilization spell, the caster cannot leave too far, or the spell will quickly lose its effect..."</p><p></p><p>Leiyu's eyes flickered as he quickly scanned the swirling ice mist around them, saying, "Elder Zhao's implication is... that powerful cultivator is still nearby? Perhaps even watching us right now?"</p><p></p><p>Leiting also became slightly alert, a trace of curiosity in her gaze, but without too much worry.</p><p></p><p>"Correct, I bet that person is hiding in the nearby ice mist, and should still be observing us," Zhao Hufa said.</p><p></p><p>Here is the full English translation of the Chinese excerpt:</p><p></p><p>The spiritual energy had been suppressed, so we couldn't sense it," Zhao Huf–∞ said confidently, then coldly continued, "Junior Sect Master, Holy Lady, watch as I flush out these sneaky fellows!"</p><p></p><p>With that, he made a hand seal and chanted, "Appear!"</p><p></p><p>Suddenly, a powerful burst of immortal energy erupted from his body, sweeping furiously in a radius of ten miles around them.</p><p></p><p>Lin Huf–∞ shielded Leiy–∏ and the others.</p><p></p><p>In an instant, the icy mist in the ten-mile radius violently churned like boiling water, then was forcefully dispersed.</p><p></p><p>Five breaths later, the area within ten miles was clearly visible. There was nothing but snow-white.</p><p></p><p>Zhao Huf–∞ looked around, carefully searching, but his expression wasn't great - this wasn't the result he wanted.</p><p></p><p>He quickly made another hand seal and chanted again.</p><p></p><p>Boom!</p><p></p><p>The immortal energy became even more violent and surging!</p><p></p><p>Subsequently, the area within twenty miles was clearly visible, but... there was still nothing!</p><p></p><p>Leiy–∏ and the others: "..."</p><p></p><p>Zhao Huf–∞'s face turned purple-black, and he helplessly waved his sleeve.</p><p></p><p>Soon, the icy mist shrouded the twenty-mile area again.</p><p></p><p>"Cough, Junior Sect Master, that person might have escaped," Zhao Huf–∞ said awkwardly.</p><p></p><p>In the special environment of the Extreme Cold Glacier, dispersing the mist within twenty kilometers was already his limit. If he pushed any further, his immortal energy might not be enough.</p><p></p><p>"It's okay, Zhao Huf–∞, don't blame yourself," Leiy–∏ said, rolling his eyes. Finally, he glanced at the hundreds of Ice Flame Tigers and said, "Not just our Great Sun Thunder Sect came to watch the show, I bet many other high-level sects are here too."</p><p></p><p>"Alright, let's go," he said.</p><p></p><p>The four of them quickly disappeared into the mist.</p><p></p><p>...</p><p></p><p>On the Extreme Cold Glacier at night, the temperature would drop to unimaginable levels. </p><p></p><p>At night, the immortal energy used to resist the bitter cold would increase several times, and combined with the extremely poor visibility, the dangers in the glacier would also increase, so the sects would usually just camp in place and rest at night.</p><p></p><p>Woo woo woo‚Äî</p><p></p><p>"Brrr, it's so cold!" </p><p></p><p>"Yeah, on this Extreme Cold Glacier, there are probably many cultivators with low cultivation who can't endure the night."</p><p></p><p>"Hehe, good thing I have a fire-attributed spiritual root, I'm much more comfortable than you all."</p><p></p><p>"..."</p><p></p><p>In the Carefree Sect camp, countless campfires were burning.</p><p></p><p>The elders sat together, the executive protectors sat together, the disciples sat together.</p><p></p><p>Peng Fang glanced at the left side of the core disciple camp, where Qi Ziran was, and many disciples were going over to flatter and curry favor with her. He then turned to Elder Su and teased, "Second Elder, your daughter-in-law is now a goddess in the eyes of many disciples."</p><p></p><p>Su Qianghe and the others chuckled.</p><p></p><p>Left Qishan was stunned for a moment, then looked over in that direction, immediately furious. Qi Ziran was his little cotton padded jacket, what did these disciples want to do? He then growled, "You little bastards! Toads wanting to eat swan meat!"</p><p></p><p>He was about to get up and go over there.</p><p></p><p>"Whoa, Second Elder, be mindful of your status," Peng Fang said, smiling as he pushed Left Qishan back down.</p><p></p><p>Left Qishan had no choice but to sit back down, his gaze like a hawk's, staring at Qi Ziran's side, looking like he wanted to devour them.</p><p></p><p>At this time, Su Qianghe sighed, "Ah, in this weather, if we had the Sect Master's wine, that would be great."</p><p></p><p>Yin Jiudui was taken aback, then said dejectedly, "Yeah, I haven't had any in a long time."</p><p></p><p>Hearing Yin Jiudui say this, Left Qishan, Su Qianghe, and Zhao Wuyou exchanged an embarrassed glance and gave a wry smile.</p><p></p><p>They remembered that the bottle of soul-cleansing vintage the Sect Master had bestowed upon them before was divided among the three of them, but they didn't leave any for Yin Jiudui...</p><p></p><p>Yin Jiudui perceptively noticed their expressions and asked suspiciously, "Hm? What's with that look on your faces?"</p>

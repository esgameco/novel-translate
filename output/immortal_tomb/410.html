        <h1>Chapter 410</h1>
        <div class="content">
            <p>Here is the full English translation of the Chinese excerpt:</p><p></p><p>Ever since Zhu Qingqing entered the teahouse, the chatter of the tea guests had become quieter.</p><p></p><p>It couldn't be helped, in Tianxiang City, aside from the Mansion of the City Lord, the Zhu Mansion and the Luo Mansion held the greatest power - they were not to be provoked.</p><p></p><p>At this time, Zhu Qingqing and Xiao Lian were sitting there, feeling very nervous.</p><p></p><p>After all, the Peerless Musician was sitting right next to them...</p><p></p><p>Previously, she had only caught a glimpse of him from afar, but now at such close proximity, how could she not be excited.</p><p></p><p>Zhu Qingqing couldn't help but glance out of the corner of her eye at the quiet young man in blue robes, her heartbeat quickening.</p><p></p><p>She, as the young miss of the Zhu Mansion in Tianxiang City, had countless suitors, but had never taken a liking to any of them.</p><p></p><p>But now, Zhu Qingqing admitted that she had completely fallen, irretrievably so.</p><p></p><p>"Miss, shall we order some tea...?" Xiao Lian whispered to Zhu Qingqing, feeling a bit awkward just sitting there doing nothing.</p><p></p><p>"Ah, yes." Zhu Qingqing reluctantly tore her gaze away from Lu Changsheng and looked at the tea menu on the wall.</p><p></p><p>Soon, she said, "Xiao Lian, let's have a pot of Qiufeng Pavilion tea."</p><p></p><p>Xiao Lian nodded, and then summoned the proprietor.</p><p></p><p>After the old man left, he quickly brought back a pot of tea and two cups.</p><p></p><p>Then the two of them quietly poured and drank the tea, their sidelong glances constantly fixed on the young man in blue robes next to them.</p><p></p><p>Regarding the burning gaze from the neighboring table, Lu Changsheng naturally noticed it. He slightly turned his head and softly said, "What are the two of you looking at me for?"</p><p></p><p>This sudden magnetic voice startled Zhu Qingqing and Xiao Lian, causing them to blush.</p><p></p><p>The Peerless Musician's musical skills were divine, and he was also handsome - who would have thought that even his voice would be so pleasant to the ear...</p><p></p><p>Zhu Qingqing marveled inwardly, then tried to find the right words, saying awkwardly, "No... it's just that we find you to be different from others..."</p><p></p><p>The old turtle heard this and chuckled. He had long since seen that these two young ladies were here for the master.</p><p></p><p>Only, these two young ladies would be disappointed - the master had no interest in love and romance.</p><p></p><p>Otherwise, the Sword Dao would not have been called the Impassive Sword.</p><p></p><p>At the same time, he couldn't help but feel a twinge of sourness. What, was he, the old turtle, not good enough?</p><p></p><p>If there were young ladies coming to find him, he would certainly welcome them wholeheartedly!</p><p></p><p>"Different from others?" Lu Changsheng's eyes rippled with a hint of interest as he asked, "Care to elaborate, in what way am I different?"</p><p></p><p>Ah?</p><p></p><p>Zhu Qingqing looked into Lu Changsheng's eyes, but when her gaze met those smiling yet emotionless orbs, she felt a chill in her heart and quickly averted her eyes, softly saying:</p><p></p><p>"Your musical skills are unparalleled, you look as pure as jade, your appearance is extraordinary, and even your voice is pleasant to hear..."</p><p></p><p>Zhu Qingqing was really at a loss for what to say when asked, and could only express her subjective feelings.</p><p></p><p>Next to her, Xiao Lian was already extremely embarrassed, wishing she could find a hole to crawl into.</p><p></p><p>The young miss, who was usually so intelligent, was now just spouting nonsense... not that it was nonsense, it was just too direct, practically confessing her love outright.</p><p></p><p>Perhaps the young miss was just nervous.</p><p></p><p>Meanwhile, the tea guests in the teahouse were already stunned, staring blankly at Lu Changsheng's side.</p><p></p><p>Zhu Qingqing's previous words had directly shocked them!</p><p></p><p>How could the noble Miss Zhu openly praise another man like that? Normally, it was the young masters who were constantly fawning over Miss Zhu!</p><p></p><p>And with that shy demeanor accompanying those words, if one said there was no hidden meaning, they wouldn't believe it.</p><p></p><p>Today, it was truly a stab in the back, opening their eyes.</p><p></p><p>Inevitably, the tea guests' gazes towards Lu Changsheng were filled with envy!</p><p></p><p>Just what kind of extraordinary person was this young man, to have gained the favor of Miss Zhu.</p><p></p><p>If they could get together, it would be like climbing up the great tree of the Zhu family, a clear path to success.</p><p></p><p>As the saying goes, "A man chases a woman across a mountain, a woman chases a man through a veil."</p><p></p><p>Especially when the woman is a beauty like Miss Zhu, with such an impressive background.</p><p></p><p>Here is the full English translation of the Chinese excerpt:</p><p></p><p>In the eyes of the tea customers, the matter had already been settled.</p><p></p><p>Until the young man's words sounded again, the tea customers suddenly paused, their jaws dropping in shock.</p><p></p><p>"Is this what you mean by being different from the rest?" </p><p></p><p>Lu Changsheng continued, "Extraordinary musical skills may be one thing, but there are so many in this world who are handsome in appearance and have pleasant voices."</p><p></p><p>Hearing this, Zhu Qingqing's eyes flickered, and she also realized that her previous words were too blunt and lacked substance. She was a bit anxious, afraid that her impression in the Qin Immortal's mind would become unfavorable.</p><p></p><p>If only she had just said his musical skills were extraordinary earlier, instead of bringing up his appearance and voice, those external factors!</p><p></p><p>That way, it would have seemed like Zhu Qingqing was a bit more dignified.</p><p></p><p>Extraordinary musical skills??? </p><p></p><p>At the same time, the tea customers finally reacted!</p><p></p><p>They stared at Lu Changsheng in shock, looking at his azure robe and the person who had been the talk of Tianxiang City lately!</p><p></p><p>The Qin Immortal!</p><p></p><p>This young man in azure was the Qin Immortal?!</p><p></p><p>The Qin Immortal had actually been right in front of their eyes, drinking tea?</p><p></p><p>Whew!</p><p></p><p>Some excited tea customers had their eyes gleaming, and they hurriedly left the teahouse after leaving the money for their tea.</p><p></p><p>"M-Master, Qingqing didn't mean that..." Zhu Qingqing said bitterly.</p><p></p><p>Lu Changsheng smiled slightly, then said no more, quietly sipping his tea.</p><p></p><p>Old Gui saw that Lu Changsheng's teacup was empty, and quickly refilled it for him.</p><p></p><p>Seeing this, Zhu Qingqing felt a bitterness in her heart, and the first meeting with the Qin Immortal had ended like this.</p><p></p><p>Xiao Lian sighed inwardly, blaming only the young miss for being too nervous. She then sent a mental message, "Young miss, you should drink some tea first..."</p><p></p><p>Zhu Qingqing gloomily picked up the teacup and took a sip, but the pleasant tea gathering had become tasteless and no longer fragrant due to her bad mood.</p><p></p><p>...</p><p></p><p>"What? The Qin Immortal has appeared in a teahouse?"</p><p></p><p>"Hurry, hurry, hurry, I heard Zhu Miss is also there!"</p><p></p><p>"Let's go, let's go, we need to occupy a favorable position, that small alley can't accommodate too many people!"</p><p></p><p>"..."</p><p></p><p>At the same time, Luo Lingyan, who had been aimlessly wandering around Tianxiang City, became energized upon hearing this news, and quickly led a group of servants to rush over there!</p><p></p><p>Especially after learning that the despicable woman Zhu Qingqing was also there, Luo Lingyan became a bit anxious.</p><p></p><p>Although that despicable woman was definitely not her match, if she managed to get close to the Qin Immortal first, it would be disastrous!</p><p></p><p>Soon, the small alley where the teahouse was located was completely packed with people!</p><p></p><p>The teahouse was also being squeezed to the point of bursting by the early arrivals.</p><p></p><p>Everyone was eagerly looking at Lu Changsheng, extremely excited, truly the Qin Immortal!</p><p></p><p>The teahouse owner was squeezed into the corner, feeling quite troubled, his small teahouse had never been this lively before...</p><p></p><p>But drinking tea requires a quiet atmosphere, this was not good.</p><p></p><p>Lu Changsheng finished the last sip of his tea and slowly stood up.</p><p></p><p>Old Gui saw this and immediately stood up, knowing that he was about to leave.</p><p></p><p>Seeing that Lu Changsheng seemed to be leaving, Zhu Qingqing became anxious, and a flash of inspiration hit her. She produced a scroll in her hand and hurriedly said:</p><p></p><p>"Master, this is a painting I made for you. Qingqing wants to give it to you..."</p><p></p><p>The crowd then noticed Zhu Qingqing, inwardly sighing that Miss Zhu was indeed also here, it seems the Qin Immortal's charm had even captivated Miss Zhu.</p><p></p><p>Presenting a painting in person was no different from confessing one's love.</p><p></p><p>"No need, thank you."</p><p></p><p>Lu Changsheng politely declined, and then he and the compassionate Old Gui suddenly disappeared from the teahouse!</p><p></p><p>Leaving behind the bewildered crowd and the dazed Zhu Qingqing holding the scroll.</p>

        <h1>Chapter 256</h1>
        <div class="content">
            <p>Here is the full English translation of the Chinese excerpt:</p><p></p><p>Hearing this, the tiger-like figure ‚òπ69shUx.cOmüéÅ‚ô£ frowned slightly.</p><p></p><p>He also had doubts in his heart. The soul body in front of him was clearly from a Taoist cultivator, and not an ordinary one at that.</p><p></p><p>But why would he appear in the reincarnation realm of mortals?</p><p></p><p>Logically, he should have appeared in the cultivator's reincarnation realm...</p><p></p><p>How strange.</p><p></p><p>Could it be that he had not returned to the cultivator's reincarnation path for some time, and the order there had been disrupted?</p><p></p><p>"Don't move," Hunxiu said indifferently, pointing a finger at the soul body's forehead.</p><p></p><p>The fingertip flashed with red light!</p><p></p><p>Gradually, gradually, Hunxiu's expression turned to one of shock and he shook his head with a wry smile.</p><p></p><p>Good grief, it's related to the Immortal Emperor again!</p><p></p><p>He also understood why the soul body appeared in the reincarnation realm of mortals.</p><p></p><p>In order to achieve the Buddha body, when crossing the ninth tribulation, he shattered his sarira and descended into a mortal, and then died.</p><p></p><p>"Who... am I?" the golden light soul body asked again.</p><p></p><p>"Your name is Li Shuyan, Dharma name Jinguan," Hunxiu said indifferently.</p><p></p><p>"Li Shuyan... Jinguan..." </p><p></p><p>Boom!!!</p><p></p><p>Suddenly, a rolling Buddhist chant echoed in the golden light soul body's ears!</p><p></p><p>He convulsed, suddenly covering his ears and kneeling on the ground!</p><p></p><p>"I... I am Li Shuyan, I am not Jinguan!!" the golden light soul body wailed, his golden light growing even more intense.</p><p></p><p>The distant old butler and the surrounding soul servants were all stunned by this sight!</p><p></p><p>Under this terrifying golden light, their soul bodies even showed signs of disintegration!</p><p></p><p>Seeing this, Hunxiu waved his hand, and a scarlet light shield isolated the golden light soul body.</p><p></p><p>Immediately, the surroundings calmed down.</p><p></p><p>"Still a Buddhist monk? How ignorant," Hunxiu looked down at the golden light soul body with disdain.</p><p></p><p>"I didn't say I was a Buddhist monk? I am Li Shuyan, I am not a Buddhist monk!" the golden light soul body's voice trembled, he was in chaos from the Buddhist chant in his ears.</p><p></p><p>Hunxiu's eyes narrowed slightly, and he smiled faintly: "Is your head splitting? The sound in your ears is not Buddhist chanting... it's just your own unwillingness and delusion."</p><p></p><p>The golden light soul body's soul trembled!</p><p></p><p>"The Immortal Emperor has already told you this, but you still haven't had a great awakening?" Remembering the figure in green, Hunxiu's eyes showed reverence as he said:</p><p></p><p>"In this world... where is the 'Buddha'? Where is the 'Buddha body'... Buddha is all beings, Buddha is you yourself. So-called achieving the Buddha body... is actually achieving yourself."</p><p></p><p>Boom!!</p><p></p><p>At this moment, the Buddhist chant in the golden light soul body's ears suddenly dissipated!</p><p></p><p>His soul body became more and more solid, and Buddhist seals densely covered it.</p><p></p><p>The golden light soul body calmed down, he slowly stood up and looked up at the towering figure, dazedly asking: "The Immortal Emperor... who is he?"</p><p></p><p>Hunxiu asked back: "Who do you say he is?"</p><p></p><p>The golden light soul body was silent for a moment, he looked at his solidified soul body and the terrifying Buddhist seals, and said, "I... am not happy at all."</p><p></p><p>"Nonsense, your happiness or unhappiness has nothing to do with this Emperor," Hunxiu said disdainfully, then grabbed the golden light Buddha body and disappeared from the mortal reincarnation realm.</p><p></p><p>"Go back."</p><p></p><p>...</p><p></p><p>Flower sea, lonely grave.</p><p></p><p>In the darkness, Jinguan opened his eyes, he looked to the side, empty.</p><p></p><p>He sighed, pushed open the grave, and stood up from it.</p><p></p><p>Turning to look at the tombstone,</p><p></p><p>On the tombstone, there was nothing.</p><p></p><p>Here is the full English translation of the Chinese excerpt:</p><p></p><p>Mirror Observation paused for a moment, then walked out of the tomb and sat down on the ground.</p><p></p><p>Gradually, the black hair disappeared, and the scar on the top of his head reappeared. The black robe on his body turned back into a tattered monk's robe.</p><p></p><p>Only his face remained youthful.</p><p></p><p>Mirror Observation looked at the swaying sea of flowers, and murmured expressionlessly,</p><p></p><p>"Where in this world is the 'Buddha'? Where is the 'Buddha body'? All beings are Buddhas, the Buddha is the poor monk himself. To achieve the Buddha body is to achieve oneself."</p><p></p><p>"Where is the tribulation to be crossed?... It is only oneself that is crossed."</p><p></p><p>After a moment, he stood up and took one last look at the tomb.</p><p></p><p>Then, he strode away barefoot into the gentle breeze.</p><p></p><p>It was just a great dream.</p><p></p><p>.........</p><p></p><p>The Crimson Celestial State, the Milo Snow Mountain.</p><p></p><p>Today, the snow is flying.</p><p></p><p>At the peak of the snow mountain, the sound of mournful bells can be heard from time to time.</p><p></p><p>A vast number of cultivators are walking in an orderly and silent manner towards the mountain peak.</p><p></p><p>This is a gesture of respect, respect for the Buddhist Master Mirror Observation.</p><p></p><p>They occasionally look up at the sky, and can often see streams of light flashing across the horizon and disappearing into the mountain peak.</p><p></p><p>They know that these are the upper echelons of the various peak forces.</p><p></p><p>Yuan Yang Chun and a few of his elders are looking around, trying to find Doctor Lu among the crowd of people.</p><p></p><p>They haven't found Doctor Lu yet, but they have seen the people from the Upper Clarity Palace, including Yun Ran.</p><p></p><p>This is not unexpected, as Yun Ran arrived earlier, but earlier everyone was gathering at the foot of the mountain and not allowed to go up.</p><p></p><p>Yun Ran also saw Yuan Yang Chun, gave him a faint glance, and then looked away.</p><p></p><p>The death of Su Lian Yi is ultimately a knot in her heart.</p><p></p><p>Between the Upper Clarity Palace and the Yang Yuan Sect, there will be a battle in the future!</p><p></p><p>But her gaze soon froze,</p><p></p><p>Who did she see?</p><p></p><p>That figure in blue, could it be Senior Lu from the Longevity Medical House?</p><p></p><p>........</p><p></p><p>On the other side.</p><p></p><p>Lu Chang Sheng is walking slowly towards the mountain, with Old Turtle and Chu Ling Tian following behind him.</p><p></p><p>Old Turtle's face is a little helpless.</p><p></p><p>Earlier, he had asked the master why he didn't just fly up.</p><p></p><p>The master said that he was about to make a big move at the ceremony of the other party, so it's better to give them some face first.</p><p></p><p>Chu Ling Tian and the others didn't mind, walking expressionlessly.</p><p></p><p>"Ling Tian, Feng Jiu, Yin Yang, Wu Shi, why are you all so quiet? Chat a bit, walking so gloomily is so boring!" Old Turtle couldn't help but look at them and grumble.</p><p></p><p>At these words, Chu Ling Tian and the others carefully glanced at Lu Chang Sheng's back, about to say something, when</p><p></p><p>Lu Chang Sheng paused in his steps and turned his head with a smile, "Old Turtle, I've found that after staying in the Ancestral Heaven Realm for a while, you've become a bit self-indulgent. Are you itching for trouble?"</p><p></p><p>Old Turtle trembled inwardly, and quickly flattered, "Master, what are you saying, how could Old Turtle dare to be self-indulgent in front of you, Master, you must have misunderstood."</p><p></p><p>"Well, then it's good. I was just about to seal your turtle mouth for ten thousand or a hundred thousand years..." Lu Chang Sheng said with a gentle smile.</p><p></p><p>Hearing this, Old Turtle turned deathly pale, his lips trembling, and he didn't dare to say another word.</p><p></p><p>Chu Ling Tian and the others, for some reason, felt secretly delighted, but they didn't dare to show it, managing their expressions and walking with their heads down.</p><p></p><p>"Excuse me, fellow Daoists, excuse me, thank you, thank you!"</p><p></p><p>At this moment, Yuan Yang Chun finally spotted Lu Chang Sheng, and with joy, he quickly led his few elders to part the crowd and hurry over.</p><p></p><p>Soon, they came up behind Lu Chang Sheng, first looking with surprise at Old Turtle and the others, then exclaiming joyfully, "Doctor Lu, you really came! Tong Xin was not deceiving me, what a coincidence to meet you here!"</p><p></p><p>Old Turtle and the others looked at each other, not knowing what the situation was.</p><p></p><p>Lu Chang Sheng turned his head and glanced at Yuan Yang Chun and the others, then smiled kindly:</p><p></p><p>"Yes, it's quite a coincidence. I also greatly admire the Buddhist Master Mirror Observation, so I came to pay my respects at his memorial service."</p>

        <h1>Chapter 503</h1>
        <div class="content">
            <p>Here is the full English translation of the Chinese excerpt:</p><p></p><p>In the venue, the crowd was bowing their heads and shivering.</p><p></p><p>How long has it been, how long has it been...</p><p></p><p>From the Chu Clan's supreme ancestor to the clan leader, elders, disciples, and countless members, not a single one survived!</p><p></p><p>A peak force like the Chu Clan, even if the eight major forces joined hands, they would not be able to take them down so quickly!</p><p></p><p>Moreover, the Chu Clan's Patriarch was so powerful!</p><p></p><p>The Chairman of the Maritime Trade Association and the Sacred King of the Land were kneeling there, their legs even a little weak.</p><p></p><p>At this moment, even though Luchang Sheng had already dispersed all the pressure in the area, the crowd still dared not get up from their kneeling position.</p><p></p><p>"What happened to the Chu Clan? Did they offend some great expert?"</p><p></p><p>"The Chairman of the Maritime Trade Association? The Sacred King of the Land? Uh..."</p><p></p><p>Suddenly, two elders appeared in the venue, hurriedly asking, but as soon as they finished speaking, they were dumbfounded, staring at the crowd in the venue.</p><p></p><p>The two elders were the Grand Ancestors of the Demon Subduing Valley and the Nine Underworld River Palace.</p><p></p><p>They were originally in seclusion, but were startled by the huge commotion and almost went into a frenzy. In a fit of anger, they came out of seclusion one after another, and then they witnessed the scene that would be unforgettable for the rest of their lives.</p><p></p><p>It was the confrontation between the Chu Clan's Patriarch and that giant hand!</p><p></p><p>The performance of the Chu Clan's Patriarch had already shocked them, and they didn't expect his hidden depths to be so deep. But what followed made their hearts ache.</p><p></p><p>As powerful as the Chu Clan's Patriarch was, in that giant palm, he was like a mere plaything!</p><p></p><p>"Why are you all kneeling?"</p><p></p><p>"Uh, Thunder Saint, Flame Saint, it's normal for them to kneel to welcome us, but why are you two kneeling as well? It's not necessary to be so courteous, we're old friends, get up, get up!"</p><p></p><p>The Chairman of the Maritime Trade Association and the Sacred King of the Land had grim expressions, signaling frantically with their eyes.</p><p></p><p>The people of the Demon Subduing Valley and the Nine Underworld River Palace snapped out of it, and hurriedly transmitted voice messages:</p><p></p><p>"Grand Ancestor! The young man in blue is the one who just destroyed the Chu Clan!"</p><p></p><p>"Grand Ancestor! You'd better hurry and pay your respects, don't you see the Chairman of the Maritime Trade Association and the Sacred King of the Land are kneeling? If you're a step slower, you might anger the young man in blue!"</p><p></p><p>"Grand Ancestor, you'd better kneel quickly, we of the Demon Subduing Valley don't want to follow in the footsteps of the Chu Clan!"</p><p></p><p>"..."</p><p></p><p>Numerous anxious and terrified voice messages echoed in the minds of the two Grand Ancestors.</p><p></p><p>They were first taken aback, then shifted their gaze to the Luchang Sheng standing with his hands behind his back, and finally their faces turned pale as they hurriedly went forward and paid their respects in a hoarse voice:</p><p></p><p>"Greetings, Your Eminence!"</p><p></p><p>Although they were completely bewildered, the destruction of the Chu Clan was vivid in their minds, so they knelt down just in case.</p><p></p><p>Luchang Sheng looked at them indifferently without saying a word.</p><p></p><p>This put the two of them under immense pressure.</p><p></p><p>At this moment, various urgent messages rang out in the venue:</p><p></p><p>"Clan Leader! Why can't you receive the messages? The outside world has changed! The Chu Clan has been destroyed by a mysterious giant hand! And, and, the continent we live on is about to be flooded! Clan Leader, please respond to the messages!"</p><p></p><p>"From all directions, super waves tens of thousands of feet high are rushing towards our continent, we can't stop them, and there are also many monsters from the Sea of Laws!"</p><p></p><p>"Clan Leader..."</p><p></p><p>What?!</p><p></p><p>Hearing these messages, the faces of all the forces in the venue changed drastically!</p><p></p><p>Soon, some of the force leaders gathered their courage and looked at Luchang Sheng, their expressions tense and bitter: "Your, Your Eminence, we..."</p><p></p><p>Before he could finish, Luchang Sheng gently waved his hand.</p><p></p><p>"Thank, thank Your Eminence!"</p><p></p><p>In the next moment, all the people of the various forces in the venue trembled as they stood up, exchanged a nervous glance, and then disappeared without a trace.</p><p></p><p>Even the Chairman of the Maritime Trade Association and the Sacred King of the Land left.</p><p></p><p>In fact, this continent was not closely related to them anyway, as long as there were the nine, oh no, eight major forces, that would be enough.</p><p></p><p>But they didn't dare to stay here either!</p><p></p><p>It would be better to follow the various forces and take a look.</p><p></p><p>"Master, we..."</p><p></p><p>The old turtle looked at Luchang Sheng and bowed, seeking instructions.</p><p></p><p>Luchang Sheng closed his eyes and sensed for a moment, then opened his eyes and smiled:</p><p></p><p>"Let's go take a look, the situation outside seems to be related to the palm strike I just made."</p><p></p><p>"Yes." The old turtle respectfully responded.</p><p></p><p>.........</p><p></p><p>Rumbling!!</p><p></p><p>The various force leaders who came out of the Spiritual Clan venue soon arrived at the edge of the continent, with the eight peak forces separating and guarding each of the four directions.</p><p></p><p>Everyone could see that in front of them, terrifying waves tens of thousands of feet high were rushing towards the continent, and they would hit it very soon!</p><p></p><p>There were four giant waves, coming from the east, west, south, and north, forming a surrounding formation.</p><p></p><p>Here is the full English translation of the Chinese excerpt:</p><p></p><p>The waves on the wall were surging with countless sea monsters from the Realm of Laws! </p><p></p><p>If these four massive waves successfully landed, this entire continent would be completely overrun!</p><p></p><p>"Hehe, everyone doesn't need to panic, these are just four slightly higher waves. We don't even need the Patriarch to step in, we can easily crush them!"</p><p></p><p>A powerful figure soon shouted loudly.</p><p></p><p>Everyone looked over and saw that the speaker was the Lord of the Demon Subduing Valley. They all felt relieved.</p><p></p><p>Indeed, they had overreacted. The people of this continent were nearly all top experts of the Three Thousand Realms, how could they be intimidated by just four waves?</p><p></p><p>"Everyone, listen to my command. Unleash the power of the Laws and crush these four walls of waves at once!"</p><p></p><p>"Attack!!"</p><p></p><p>In the next moment, endless streams of Lawful power erupted from all four directions, violently bombarding the walls of waves.</p><p></p><p>But soon, the stunned onlookers saw that this unparalleled Lawful power was mysteriously absorbed by the waves upon impact.</p><p></p><p>This... this...</p><p></p><p>The leaders of the eight major factions anxiously looked up at the four Profound Mysteries experts in the sky, hoping they would intervene.</p><p></p><p>Meanwhile, the faces of the Shipping Guild President and the others were grave, with beads of sweat dripping from their foreheads.</p><p></p><p>Looking towards the east, south, west and north, their pupils constricted as they gazed at the walls of waves - or more precisely, at what was behind them...</p><p></p><p>From their elevated vantage point, they could see that behind each wall of waves was a dense swarm of sea monsters, stretching as far as the eye could see.</p><p></p><p>Even these Profound Mysteries experts, who had cultivated for many years, had never witnessed such a terrifying sight.</p><p></p><p>The Shipping Guild President and the others had initially thought that these four walls of waves were caused by the ripples from the battle between the Azure-Robed Man and the Radiant Saint.</p><p></p><p>But now it was clear that these countless sea monsters had been lurking around this continent for a long time, obviously waiting to invade.</p><p></p><p>The battle between the Azure-Robed Man and the Radiant Saint was merely the trigger for these sea monsters to launch their invasion.</p><p></p><p>"Rumble, rumble, rumble!!"</p><p></p><p>The four walls of waves were about to submerge the entire continent, terrifying the onlookers, who frantically called out to the four Profound Mysteries experts in the sky for help.</p><p></p><p>"Thunder Saint! Flame Saint!"</p><p>"Patriarch!!"</p><p></p><p>The four from the Shipping Guild tightened their expressions, rapidly activating their Lawful connections to the heavens and earth, preparing to unleash their Profound Mysteries in an attempt to intercept the four walls of waves.</p><p></p><p>"You four may be able to block these four walls of waves, but can you stop the endless hordes from my Realm of Laws? Hahaha!!"</p><p></p><p>At this moment, a mocking laughter that split the air like a madman's cackle came from behind the walls of waves.</p><p></p><p>The next instant, a towering figure with a dark green hue suddenly appeared before the four from the Shipping Guild, looking at them coldly.</p><p></p><p>The Shipping Guild members finally got a good look at the monster's appearance, their pupils constricting in shock.</p><p></p><p>The monster was humanoid, with a dark green body full of explosive muscles. It wore a crown on its head, its face resembling a clown with a pair of enormous flapping ears on the sides.</p><p></p><p>Without any hesitation, the humanoid monster suddenly lunged towards the four from the Shipping Guild.</p><p></p><p>The four were alarmed and tried to use their Profound Mysteries, but their faces immediately changed drastically.</p><p></p><p>The Lawful power within them had somehow become stagnant, unable to be unleashed!</p><p></p><p>"Haha haha!"</p><p></p><p>At this moment, a strange laughter rang out, and the humanoid monster was already in front of the Shipping Guild members, rapidly delivering a powerful punch to the abdomen of each one.</p><p></p><p>"Bang! Bang! Bang! Bang!"</p><p></p><p>"Poof!!"</p><p></p><p>The four Shipping Guild members immediately doubled over, violently coughing up blood, and then plummeted down towards the ground below.</p><p></p><p>This scene was witnessed by the onlookers below, their pupils constricting to pinpricks, their throats convulsing in terror.</p><p></p><p>They were even too frightened to scream.</p><p></p><p>Four Profound Mysteries experts representing the pinnacle of the Three Thousand Realms had been so easily dealt with by this sea monster?</p><p></p><p>The leaders of the various factions quickly flew up to catch the four severely injured Profound Mysteries experts.</p><p></p><p>At this time, the humanoid monster looked down at the people below, baring its teeth in a sinister grin:</p><p></p><p>"We, the Sea Clan, not only aim to dominate the seas, but also to rule the lands. Today, we shall start with this strongest of continents... Oh, and you may address me as the Deep Sea Emperor. Hehe!"</p><p></p><p>As the Deep Sea Emperor spoke, the four walls of waves suddenly surged down towards the continent, about to completely submerge it.</p><p></p><p>PS: If the Sea King is at the Demon Realm level, then what level is the Deep Sea Emperor?</p>

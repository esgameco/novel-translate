        <h1>Chapter 124</h1>
        <div class="content">
            <p>Here is the full English translation of the Chinese novel excerpt:</p><p></p><p>"Brother Sea, what did the Sect Master and the Elders say?" asked Gu Helin anxiously.</p><p></p><p>Sea Dong did not speak, but it was Wu Che who said disappointedly, "The Sect Master and the Elders originally wanted to relocate, but they heard that countless powerful experts would rush to aid them, so they temporarily canceled the plan."</p><p></p><p>Sea Dong nodded.</p><p></p><p>Gu Helin let out a slight sigh of relief upon hearing this, "That's good then."</p><p></p><p>Wu Che and Sea Dong exchanged a puzzled glance, looking at Gu Helin and asking, "Brother Gu, what do you mean by that? Relocating would be better, wouldn't it? Staying in the remote Langtian Domain is too dangerous."</p><p></p><p>Gu Helin shook his head and sighed, "If we relocate, the common people cannot relocate with us. What will happen to them? They are all innocent."</p><p></p><p>Huh?</p><p></p><p>Wu Che and Sea Dong were dumbfounded. They didn't expect Gu Helin to be such a person of great righteousness, which was quite different from their own thoughts. </p><p></p><p>They didn't really care about the well-being of those common people. In this chaotic world, it was already difficult to take care of themselves. </p><p></p><p>But since Gu Helin had such a noble character, they naturally couldn't say anything, and could only praise him admiringly, "Brother Gu is truly benevolent."</p><p></p><p>Gu Helin gave a wry smile and fell silent.</p><p></p><p>"This Langtian Domain, after the Heavenly Eternal Sect was destroyed six hundred years ago, the Chu, Huang, and Chen three major immortal clans are the strongest in power here. I heard they haven't relocated either, I wonder what the reason is," sighed Sea Dong.</p><p></p><p>...</p><p></p><p>Outside the Eastern Immortal Realm, in the continuous mountain ranges.</p><p></p><p>Two distinguished guests had come to the Howling Heaven Demon Tiger Clan - the Demon Tree Emperor of the Black Mountain Tree Demon Clan and the Nine-Winged Flying Wyrm Emperor of the Flying Wyrm Clan.</p><p></p><p>"What an unexpected visit! Demon Tree Emperor and Flying Wyrm Emperor, what brings you to my domain today?" asked the Demon Tiger Emperor with a flashing smile, his physique robust.</p><p></p><p>The Demon Tree Emperor, a thin and withered old man in a gray robe, spoke solemnly, "Demon Tiger Emperor, the reason the Flying Wyrm Emperor and I have come today, I'm sure you already know. Let's not beat around the bush - that powerful external force is invading the Five Great Immortal Realms. Shouldn't we three clans do something about it?"</p><p></p><p>The Flying Wyrm Emperor silently nodded in agreement. They had many connections in the Five Great Immortal Realms, so they naturally understood the gravity of the current situation. If that external force was not so powerful, the Five Great Immortal Realms would not be in such turmoil.</p><p></p><p>"So what does the Demon Tree Emperor suggest we should do?" asked the Demon Tiger Emperor.</p><p></p><p>The Demon Tree Emperor looked deeply at the Demon Tiger Emperor and said, "In my opinion, we should quickly equip ourselves and rush to aid the Five Great Immortal Realms before that external force arrives."</p><p></p><p>The Demon Tiger Emperor was about to say something, but the Demon Tree Emperor interrupted him, waving his hand, "I know what you want to say, but you must understand, this is not us going to help the Immortal Realms out of kindness, but because we three clans need the Immortal Realms!"</p><p></p><p>"We three clans are outside the Eastern Immortal Realm. Who knows if that external force will target us first? It's better to be prepared and unite with the Immortal Realms."</p><p></p><p>The Demon Tiger Emperor frowned deeply upon hearing this...</p><p></p><p>Seeing this, the Flying Wyrm Emperor sternly said, "Don't hesitate. Although the four Immortal Emperors are not acquainted with us, you shouldn't forget that the Eternal Life Immortal Emperor of the Central Immortal Realm has bestowed grace upon our three clans! The Eternal Life Immortal Emperor has been missing for a million years, and now this great calamity has arrived. We must do something for his Central Immortal Realm."</p><p></p><p>The Demon Tiger Emperor's body shuddered, and he roared, "Alright! Then let's equip ourselves and enter the Eastern Immortal Realm to find the three Immortal Lords under the Eternal Life Immortal Emperor."</p><p></p><p>The Demon Tree Emperor and the Flying Wyrm Emperor finally let out a sigh of relief. It seems they had to invoke the Eternal Life Immortal Emperor to persuade this Demon Tiger Emperor. </p><p></p><p>But aside from that, if they didn't equip themselves and unite with the Immortal Realms, they would likely be the first to be targeted when that external force arrives.</p><p></p><p>...</p><p></p><p>At the same moment, in a place even more distant from the Five Great Immortal Realms, </p><p></p><p>Countless black shadows were sweeping across the sky, covering the heavens and the earth, as if the entire desolate world was being compressed!</p><p></p><p>At the very forefront of these innumerable black shadows, there were twenty figures standing side by side!</p><p></p><p>All eyes were burning with reverence, gazing at them!</p><p></p><p>Here is the full English translation of the Chinese excerpt:</p><p></p><p>The Abyssal Demon Clan!</p><p></p><p>They were burly and muscular, with demonic wings flapping behind them. Their hair stood up like porcupine quills, cascading down their backs. They had horns on their heads and a single, large vertical eye, with mouths that stretched to their ears!</p><p></p><p>Their bodies were mostly exposed, with only their crotches covered in fur. Their purple-blue skin revealed bulging muscles and protruding veins, exuding an explosive power!</p><p></p><p>Especially the twenty figures in the front, whose sizes were even more gigantic, looking ferocious with their large demonic wings, emanating a chilling aura.</p><p></p><p>"We should be approaching the Five Great Immortal Realms soon..." </p><p></p><p>Youshi (Yuxia) looked into the hazy distance, his eyes containing murderous intent and madness, speaking indifferently.</p><p></p><p>"Yes, Clan Chief, I can already smell the enticing scent of fresh blood in the air..." The high-ranking Abyssal Demon beside him, looking at the map in his hand, grinned.</p><p></p><p>If it weren't for the route map bestowed by the Ancestral Celestial Realm, they would never have found the Five Great Immortal Realms in the vast expanse.</p><p></p><p>"Hehe, that's good." Youshi let out a chilling laugh.</p><p></p><p>"Clan Chief, what exactly did the Ancestral Celestial Realm grant our Abyssal Demon Clan? Those people from the Ancestral Celestial Realm are quite cunning. We might just be their cannon fodder, you mustn't be deceived." </p><p></p><p>Another Abyssal Demon shook his head and sighed.</p><p></p><p>Although Youshi was the Clan Chief, the other nineteen high-ranking members of the Abyssal Demon Clan also had a say. They were always direct in expressing their thoughts.</p><p></p><p>Hearing this, some other Abyssal Demons also looked at Youshi with questioning eyes, as the Clan Chief had not yet told them the reason.</p><p></p><p>Youshi, unfazed, said, "The Immortal Emperors of the Five Great Immortal Realms are at the peak of the Four Realms, with power comparable to ours. However, their lifespans are much shorter than ours. They have not been able to ascend to the Ancestral Celestial Realm for a long time, and that is the doing of the Ancestral Celestial Realm."</p><p></p><p>"Even though the Immortal Path has been blocked, those four Immortal Emperors have not given up, guarding the Immortal Path for years. This has completely exhausted the patience of the Ancestral Celestial Realm, leading to our Abyssal Demon Clan's invasion of the Five Great Immortal Realms."</p><p></p><p>The demons looked at each other, confused, not understanding what this had to do with them.</p><p></p><p>"Hehe, the fundamental reason for not allowing the four Immortal Emperors to ascend is that the Ancestral Celestial Realm doesn't have enough positions. As long as we complete this task, the Ancestral Celestial Realm will open the Immortal Path to let our Clan Chief enter, and our Abyssal Demon Clan will completely replace the Five Great Immortal Realms. In the future, we will have a spot to enter the Ancestral Celestial Realm periodically, which is much less pressure than the Four Immortal Emperors ascending all at once."</p><p></p><p>"Although our Abyssal Demon Clan has a longer lifespan, we will also have our day of passing. Have you forgotten how many Clan Chiefs we have lost? Don't you want to break free of this shackle and go to the Ancestral Celestial Realm? Why should only the Five Great Immortal Realms be allowed to do so?!"</p><p></p><p>"This will be the opportunity for our Abyssal Demon Clan to thrive completely!!"</p><p></p><p>Towards the end, Youshi's tone became more and more passionate and intense.</p><p></p><p>The Abyssal Demon Clan's high-ranking members were thoroughly moved, their single eyes shining with brilliant light.</p><p></p><p>"The Clan Chief is right! We will replace the Five Great Immortal Realms!!"</p><p></p><p>The demons bared their teeth and shouted excitedly.</p><p></p><p>"Oh yes, Clan Chief, I heard that the Immortal Emperor of the Central Immortal Realm is named Lu Changsheng? Doesn't that sound familiar to you?" Suddenly, one of the Abyssal Demons asked.</p><p></p><p>Youshi fell silent for a moment, recalling a young man in green robes and his old servant who had once come to their territory long ago.</p><p></p><p>He then waved his hand and said, "The Four Realms are so vast, it's just a coincidence that they have the same name. It can't be him."</p><p></p><p>The Abyssal Demons pursed their lips, relieved to hear that.</p><p></p><p>After all, that young man in green robes was quite troublesome.</p><p></p><p>If he happened to be the Immortal Emperor Lu Changsheng of the Central Immortal Realm, the outcome of this battle would be uncertain.</p><p></p><p>"No need to think too much! Advance at full speed, this time we will definitely stain the skies of the Five Great Immortal Realms with blood!"</p><p></p><p>"You've been complaining about being tired of beast blood, right? This time, you'll get to drink human blood, and drink it to your heart's content!!"</p>

        <h1>Chapter 188</h1>
        <div class="content">
            <p>Here is the full English translation of the Chinese excerpt:</p><p></p><p>In the late night, the news of the disappearance of the Longevity Tavern spread throughout the entire Qingxuan Town. </p><p></p><p>At first, many cultivators did not believe it, but when they hurried to the site, they were stunned. </p><p></p><p>Where was the Longevity Tavern in this corner of Qingxuan Town? Instead, there was only withered grass everywhere. </p><p></p><p>Everyone even felt like they had dreamed, as if the Longevity Tavern had never existed.</p><p></p><p>But when many cultivators took out the treasured Manuspring Liquor, they realized that the Longevity Tavern had indeed existed.</p><p></p><p>And this free Manuspring Liquor was probably a farewell gift from the proprietor...</p><p></p><p>Many cultivators felt a little disappointed in their hearts. With the proprietor's departure, Qingxuan Town seemed to have suddenly lost its former liveliness.</p><p></p><p>Liveliness always seems to be fleeting.</p><p></p><p>Perhaps with the passage of time, the cultivators of Tian Zhi Yin will gradually forget many things.</p><p></p><p>But there are two things that will be remembered and passed down:</p><p></p><p>First, the most exquisite liquor in the world is the Xishen, Rumeng, and Manuspring from the disappeared Longevity Tavern.</p><p></p><p>Second, the proprietor of the Longevity Tavern was the number one expert in the history of Tian Zhi Yin, whose status and reputation were unshakable.</p><p></p><p>...</p><p></p><p>Lu Changsheng smoothly passed through the extremely dense forest.</p><p></p><p>At the time, Peng Fang and the others were a bit puzzled, because not only the Ancestral Beasts, but even ordinary demonic beasts were nowhere to be seen, as if they were avoiding them.</p><p></p><p>It was as if all the beast roars had fallen silent the moment they stepped into the extremely dense forest.</p><p></p><p>How strange.</p><p></p><p>But they guessed that the demonic beasts must have been intimidated by Lu Changsheng's aura.</p><p></p><p>As for the Ancestral Beasts, they might be in seclusion.</p><p></p><p>...</p><p></p><p>Spring flowers, autumn moon, summer sun, winter snow... the beauty of time lies in its inevitable passing.</p><p></p><p>Five years later, this was the 1,415th year since Lu Changsheng had emerged from the Immortal Tomb in the Lingchen Realm.</p><p></p><p>In the other world of Tian Zhi Yin, it was called Linglang Heavens.</p><p></p><p>The territory of Linglang Heavens seemed even more vast than Tian Zhi Yin, but the entire Linglang Heavens was divided into only three domains: Heaven, Earth, and Human.</p><p></p><p>In this realm, numerous sects flourished, and the sect culture was extremely prevalent.</p><p></p><p>There was a strict hierarchical division among the sects, with the first rank being the highest and the ninth rank being the lowest.</p><p></p><p>The sect hierarchy in Linglang Heavens was the exact opposite of the Four Great Immortal Realms, but... the prevalence of sects in the Five Great Immortal Realms was far less than in Linglang Heavens!</p><p></p><p>Moreover, the realm attainments of the Five Great Immortal Emperors of the past were constrained by their environments, and their realms were all at the lower end. Even if they were placed in Tian Zhi Yin, they would only be powerful cultivators, and it would be difficult for them to reach the peak ranks.</p><p></p><p>If the Five Great Immortal Realms were ruled by the Five Great Immortal Emperor Palaces, then Linglang Heavens was dominated by the first-rank sects.</p><p></p><p>In the entire Linglang Heavens, among the numerous sects like stars, there were only nine first-rank sects, distributed in the Heaven, Earth, and Human domains, standing at the top, overlooking the entire Linglang Heavens!</p><p></p><p>In the south of the Human Domain, there was Canglang Zhou.</p><p></p><p>Feiyun City.</p><p></p><p>At this time, the city was bustling with activity, and various discussions were flying everywhere.</p><p></p><p>"Tomorrow is the day when the three major sects recruit disciples! This time, I must enter the ninth-rank sect Blood Flame Pavilion! If I miss this opportunity, I'll have no chance left!"</p><p></p><p>"I want to join the Nihong Pavilion, where there are many beautiful senior sisters... Black, Blood Flame Pavilion, Nihong Pavilion, and Senluo Gate, which one do you want to join? Why don't you come with me to try our luck at Nihong Pavilion?"</p><p></p><p>"My name is Cai Xu, can you stop calling me by my nickname? It's so ugly!"</p><p></p><p>Here is the full English translation of the excerpt from the Chinese novel:</p><p></p><p>"I don't care, haven't I been calling you by your nickname since we were little? I'm going to call you 'Little Black'!"</p><p></p><p>Upon hearing this, Cai Xu looked around and saw many people giving him strange looks. His expression became a bit unpleasant as he softly said, "Abin, can you give me a little face when there are a lot of people around?"</p><p></p><p>Huang Bin let out a chuckle and abruptly grabbed Cai Xu's sleeve, and the two of them left the crowd that was murmuring and went to a quieter place.</p><p></p><p>"Haha, Little Black, look at how thin-skinned you are. Now I can finally call you that, right?" Huang Bin burst out laughing.</p><p></p><p>Cai Xu helplessly nodded. When there were fewer people around, it didn't really matter, since he had gotten used to Huang Bin calling him that since they were young.</p><p></p><p>He suddenly said, "Abin, do you really want to join the Nihong Pavilion? But I've heard that the requirements for male disciples there are even stricter..."</p><p></p><p>Hearing this, the smile on Huang Bin's face faded a bit, and he sighed dejectedly, "That's right, the requirements are very strict. I'm just going to try my luck, but I know my abilities are average."</p><p></p><p>However, he wasn't too bothered by it. Even though outside there was a lot of discussion about which sect they wanted to join, in the end, very few of them from Feiyan City would actually be able to enter the three major sects.</p><p></p><p>The three major sects didn't only recruit disciples from their city, but from other cities as well, so the competition was extremely fierce.</p><p></p><p>"Abin, why don't you come with me to the Xiaoyao Sect?"</p><p></p><p>At this moment, Cai Xu suddenly grabbed Huang Bin's shoulders and said.</p><p></p><p>Huang Bin was stunned. The Xiaoyao Sect?</p><p></p><p>In this southern region of Canglang Zhou, aside from the Blood Flame Pavilion, the Nihong Pavilion, and the Sengluo Gate, the three major ninth-rank sects, when did the Xiaoyao Sect appear?</p><p></p><p>He had never heard of it before. Could it be a small, unranked sect?</p><p></p><p>"Little Black, where did you hear about the Xiaoyao Sect? It's not some small, unranked sect, is it?" Huang Bin asked with wide eyes.</p><p></p><p>"Shh." Cai Xu gestured for him to be quiet, then mysteriously smiled and said, "Abin, I'll tell you, the Xiaoyao Sect may have just been recently established, but I can tell you that it might not be weaker than sects like the Blood Flame Pavilion, the ninth-rank sects."</p><p></p><p>"Whew!" Huang Bin took a sharp intake of breath, looking at him with disbelief. "Is that true?"</p><p></p><p>"Although it's just my guess, it's probably not far off!" Cai Xu said proudly. "A while ago, I had the good fortune to meet a senior brother from the Xiaoyao Sect, I think his name was Tong Xin. You won't believe how strong he is!"</p><p></p><p>Huang Bin blankly asked, "What... what realm is he at?"</p><p></p><p>Cai Xu solemnly said, "Golden Immortal..."</p><p></p><p>"Hiss, Golden Immortal? If the Xiaoyao Sect is comparable to the ninth-rank sects, then why is he just a disciple? Shouldn't he be one of the core elders of the sect?" Huang Bin exclaimed in shock.</p><p></p><p>After all, to promote a sect to the ninth rank, there were prerequisites - the sect must have a Great Celestial Immortal presiding over it, and have at least ten Golden Immortal elders. This was the basic requirement for a sect to be promoted to the ninth rank.</p><p></p><p>"No!" Cai Xu shook his head and said seriously, "Tong Xin Senior Brother said he is just a disciple."</p><p></p><p>Huang Bin's gaze became dazed as he hesitantly said, "Little Black, you couldn't have been deceived, right?"</p><p></p><p>"Impossible, I can tell if someone is lying or not." Cai Xu stated firmly.</p><p></p><p>Huang Bin asked puzzledly, "Then why haven't we heard any news about the Xiaoyao Sect recruiting disciples?"</p><p></p><p>Cai Xu chuckled and said, "Tong Xin Senior Brother said their sect has just been recently established and is still in the preparatory stage, but when the time comes, they will definitely make a big splash!"</p>

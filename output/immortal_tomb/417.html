        <h1>Chapter 417</h1>
        <div class="content">
            <p>Here is the full English translation of the Chinese excerpt:</p><p></p><p>Borrow a Knife to Kill?</p><p></p><p>Guo Xiong's pupils contracted as he looked at the Prefect.</p><p></p><p>It wasn't that the phrase "borrow a knife to kill" scared him, but whose knife would he borrow?</p><p></p><p>The knife of the Ninth Prince and the Qin Saint!</p><p></p><p>If he did this, how would it be any different from dancing on the knife's edge?</p><p></p><p>If the Ninth Prince and the Qin Saint were to discover it, he wouldn't even know how he died!</p><p></p><p>Originally, he was afraid that the Qin Immortal would offend the Qin Saint, so he wanted to drive him away. But now, he actually wanted to borrow a knife to kill?</p><p></p><p>This was not just a case of a mouse licking a cat, it was actively seeking trouble.</p><p></p><p>"No! No, no! Prefect, you can't say such things casually. The Ninth Prince might be fooled, but a figure like the Qin Saint would definitely notice. If that happens, our Prefectural Lord's Mansion won't be able to get away with it!"</p><p></p><p>Guo Xiong indeed refused, shaking his head like a rattle drum.</p><p></p><p>Seeing this, the Prefect was also helpless. He had guessed that Guo Xiong wouldn't dare, after all, compared to the Ninth Prince and the Qin Saint, Guo Xiong's status as the Prefectural Lord was practically no different from a locust.</p><p></p><p>Who would dare to scheme against a towering tree?</p><p></p><p>"Prefect, your courage is indeed great, daring to speak such words. In this regard, I, the Prefectural Lord, am not as good as you."</p><p></p><p>Guo Xiong glanced at the Prefect and sighed, "Don't say such things in the future. It's fine among ourselves, but if someone with ill intentions hears it..."</p><p></p><p>The Prefect pursed his lips and said, "Prefectural Lord, the reason I dare to say this is that I have a foolproof plan."</p><p></p><p>Hearing this, Guo Xiong looked at him with surprise and anticipation, waiting for him to continue.</p><p></p><p>After all, according to the City Guard Captain's words, that Qin Immortal indeed had some abilities. Dealing with him directly might be troublesome, and he might even end up in hot water.</p><p></p><p>The Prefect's eyes flickered as he said, "Prefectural Lord, since the Ninth Prince and the Qin Saint have arrived in our Tianxiang City, you only need to lead them naturally to the Youting Lake, which is the iconic scenic spot of our Tianxiang City..."</p><p></p><p>"As for whether the Ninth Prince and the Qin Saint will encounter that Qin Immortal, we'll just leave it to fate. If they do meet, our plan to borrow a knife to kill will naturally succeed. If they don't, then so be it."</p><p></p><p>"After all, everything will be reasonable and natural. Even the Qin Saint won't be able to detect anything!"</p><p></p><p>Guo Xiong's eyes narrowed. This plan was indeed feasible, but...</p><p></p><p>"Prefect, but if this ends up offending the Qin Saint, we'll still be the ones who suffer," Guo Xiong said helplessly.</p><p></p><p>The Prefect smiled slightly, "Prefectural Lord, don't worry. Even if the Qin Saint is disturbed in his elegance, at most he'll just see us in a slightly unfavorable light. A figure like the Qin Saint, this kind of small matter will probably be forgotten the next day."</p><p></p><p>Guo Xiong paused, then gritted his teeth and said, "Alright! Let's do it that way then!"</p><p></p><p>The Prefect shook his head, "No, Prefectural Lord, we haven't actually done anything, have we?"</p><p></p><p>Guo Xiong narrowed his eyes and silently nodded.</p><p></p><p>...</p><p></p><p>Outside Tianxiang City.</p><p></p><p>As soon as Guo Xiong and the Prefect landed, they saw that Zhu Guoyuan and Luo Qian had already arrived and were waiting.</p><p></p><p>Guo Xiong nodded to the two of them, and then they all looked up at the sky. Sure enough, at this moment, two luxurious palace carriages were slowly descending from the heavens.</p><p></p><p>There were two cultivators standing on each carriage.</p><p></p><p>Cloud Ao Yi had not brought many people, just four of his trusted subordinates, as he had Ye Xunwang with him, so there was no need for a large entourage.</p><p></p><p>In the carriage, Cloud Ao Yi looked down at the red carpet and the banner that had been raised, and smiled, "Uncle Ye, the Prefectural Lord of Tianxiang City seems to have quite an eye for this."</p><p></p><p>Next to him, Ye Xunwang nodded slightly without saying anything.</p><p></p><p>As the carriages landed on the ground,</p><p></p><p>everyone respectfully bowed down!</p><p></p><p>Guo Xiong loudly proclaimed:</p><p></p><p>"I, the humble one, specially welcome the two Prefects, the Ninth Prince, and the Qin Saint!"</p><p></p><p>Cloud Ao Yi was the first to step out of the carriage, glancing at Guo Xiong and the others, then went to the other carriage, bowed, and invited the Qin Saint out, "Uncle Ye."</p><p></p><p>"Mm." Ye Xunwang stepped out of the carriage and said, "Ao Yi, you take care of it."</p><p></p><p>"Yes." Cloud Ao Yi bowed.</p><p></p><p>Here is the full English translation of the Chinese excerpt:</p><p></p><p>He then straightened up and said indifferently, "You may all rise."</p><p></p><p>"Thank you, Your Highness Prince Jiu!"</p><p></p><p>Guo Xiong and the others stood up cautiously, not daring to look directly at Yun Aoye and Ye Xunwang.</p><p></p><p>Yun Aoye looked at Zhu Guyuan meaningfully and then smiled lightly, "Let's go into the city."</p><p></p><p>"Yes, yes, yes! Your Highness Prince Jiu, Qin Saint and I will lead the way!" </p><p></p><p>Guo Xiong hurriedly went ahead to lead the way.</p><p></p><p>Afterwards, with Guo Xiong and the others guiding and introducing them, Yun Aoye and the others stepped over the red carpet and entered Tianxiang City.</p><p></p><p>...</p><p></p><p>In Tianxiang City, the citizens had already lined the streets on both sides, enthusiastically waving their arms to welcome Yun Aoye and Ye Xunwang.</p><p></p><p>"Wow, is that His Highness Prince Jiu? As a royal scion, he is indeed noble and distinguished."</p><p></p><p>"Yes, Prince Jiu looks extremely handsome and amiable, not at all like the rumors say..."</p><p></p><p>"Is the refined middle-aged man by Prince Jiu's side the legendary Qin Saint? He truly has an extraordinary demeanor."</p><p></p><p>"..."</p><p></p><p>The citizens were whispering and discussing amongst themselves.</p><p></p><p>Seeing this, Yun Aoye couldn't help but look at Guo Xiong and smile, "Your Tianxiang City has a good folk custom!"</p><p></p><p>Guo Xiong was delighted, and he flattered, "The citizens have always revered His Highness Prince Jiu, so they are naturally very excited to see Prince Jiu in person."</p><p></p><p>"Hehe." Yun Aoye smiled, then suddenly looked around and frowned, pretending to ask, "Hmm? Why are there more men than women in your Tianxiang City? Could it be that you still practice the idea of valuing men over women?"</p><p></p><p>Yun Aoye was a bit displeased at the moment. Along the way, he hadn't seen a single pretty girl, only old women!</p><p></p><p>Where were the young ladies of Tianxiang City? Had they all died?</p><p></p><p>Huh?</p><p></p><p>Guo Xiong and the others were taken aback, then quickly looked around and found that, indeed, there were very few young women, just as Prince Jiu had said.</p><p></p><p>Guo Xiong's face darkened as he immediately understood what was going on.</p><p></p><p>It must be that upon hearing of Prince Jiu's arrival, the young women of the city had gotten scared and hidden themselves away...</p><p></p><p>Guo Xiong cleared his throat, pondered for a moment, and respectfully said, "Your Highness Prince Jiu, the yin and yang in our Tianxiang City have always been balanced, and it is not a case of valuing men over women. In my humble opinion, those young women are shy and delighted to hear of Your Highness's arrival, so they have hidden themselves in their chambers..."</p><p></p><p>Fu Guan, Zhu Guyuan, and the others pursed their lips and lowered their heads, admiring Guo Xiong's ability to lie without blushing or panting.</p><p></p><p>Yun Aoye let out a hearty laugh and waved his hand, "I can understand that!"</p><p></p><p>"You let the young ladies of the city come out, as there are countless women in the Cloud Mist Ancient Kingdom who admire me, which is only natural!"</p><p></p><p>"Yes, yes, yes..." Guo Xiong forced a smile, then suddenly had a flash of inspiration and said calmly:</p><p></p><p>"Your Highness Prince Jiu, our Tianxiang City has a landmark attraction called Youting Lake. Now that it is the season of spring blossoms, it is especially beautiful. Why don't I have the young ladies gather at Youting Lake, and Your Highness and the Qin Saint can go there for a stroll as well?"</p><p></p><p>From the side, Fu Guan gave Guo Xiong a subtle look.</p><p></p><p>"Hehe, good!" </p><p></p><p>Yun Aoye smiled, then looked at the quiet Ye Xunwang beside him: "Uncle Ye, shall we go to Youting Lake and enjoy the scenery?"</p><p></p><p>Ye Xunwang nodded lightly.</p><p></p><p>Afterwards, Guo Xiong quickly issued an order, and the young ladies of the city all gathered at Youting Lake - the girls were so frightened that their faces turned pale!</p><p></p><p>As for Yun Aoye, Ye Xunwang, and the others, they followed Guo Xiong and the others to Youting Lake.</p>

        <h1>Chapter 83</h1>
        <div class="content">
            <p>Here is the full English translation of the Chinese excerpt:</p><p></p><p>"What?!" </p><p></p><p>The three of them - Shen Jing Tao, Jiang Yuan, and the others - were all startled, their hearts pounding.</p><p></p><p>Gu He Lin narrowed his eyes. So they had indeed chosen this moment to attack, but why only the Demon Realm? What about the Devil Realm?</p><p></p><p>"Elder, what should we do? We're in the Western Realm, there's no way we can make it back in time!" </p><p></p><p>The Grand Elder asked anxiously.</p><p></p><p>Shen Jing Tao abruptly looked towards Jiang Yuan, Qin Miao, and Liu Wu Su - the three Tribulation Transcending Cultivators were the only ones who might be able to reach the Eastern Realm in a relatively short time.</p><p></p><p>The next moment, Shen Jing Tao flashed in front of the three of them, bowing deeply as he spoke in a low but clear voice that carried throughout the area:</p><p></p><p>"Esteemed seniors, I am Shen Jing Tao from the Azure Cloud Sect in the Eastern Realm. Our sect has just received an emergency message - the Demon Realm has launched a massive invasion! I beseech you three seniors to lend us your aid!"</p><p></p><p>Shen Jing Tao had intended for everyone to hear, so his low shout was loud enough to reach all present.</p><p></p><p>Immediately, the plaza outside the Carefree Courtyard fell silent, as all the cultivators stared at Shen Jing Tao in shock.</p><p></p><p>An invasion by the Demon Realm?!</p><p></p><p>Meanwhile, Gu He Lin had quietly approached the old turtle. He first glanced cautiously at the seated Lu Chang Sheng with his eyes closed, then looked pleadingly at the old turtle.</p><p></p><p>"Senior Turtle... have you been enjoying your time these past few days? Little Black even took you to tour the kiln, all at my request..."</p><p></p><p>Hearing Gu He Lin's transmission, the old turtle's eyelid twitched, and he smacked his lips. "You really are something, aren't you."</p><p></p><p>"Master, the old turtle will go take care of some matters."</p><p></p><p>The old turtle said to Lu Chang Sheng, then abruptly pulled Gu He Lin away, the two of them vanishing from the plaza without a trace.</p><p></p><p>Lu Chang Sheng remained seated with his eyes closed, unmoving.</p><p></p><p>...</p><p></p><p>All eyes were fixed on Shen Jing Tao, not doubting the truth of his words. </p><p></p><p>A Transcendent Cultivator would not dare to speak lies in front of three Tribulation Transcending Seniors.</p><p></p><p>And many cultivators vaguely recalled hearing rumors years ago about the Demon and Devil Realms plotting something...</p><p></p><p>It seems those rumors were not unfounded after all! </p><p></p><p>Taking advantage of the fact that Zhang You Dao had ascended, with countless cultivators gathered in the Western Realm, the Demon and Devil Realms would not let such an opportunity slip by.</p><p></p><p>"What? The Demon Realm has invaded?" </p><p></p><p>Qin Miao, Liu Wu Su, and the others were shocked, exchanging glances.</p><p></p><p>"Only the Demon Realm, not the Devil Realm?" Liu Wu Su asked.</p><p></p><p>Shen Jing Tao quickly shook his head. "Wu Su senior, the message from our sect only mentioned the Demon Realm, not the Devil Realm."</p><p></p><p>Liu Wu Su nodded, looking at Qin Miao and Jiang Yuan. "Jiang fellow Daoist, I'll go to the Eastern Realm with Qin Xianzi."</p><p></p><p>Qin Miao agreed with a nod.</p><p></p><p>Seeing this, Shen Jing Tao inwardly relaxed a bit.</p><p></p><p>But just as Qin Miao and Liu Wu Su were about to depart, a laugh rang out.</p><p></p><p>"Hold on, you two."</p><p></p><p>Qin Miao and Liu Wu Su turned around, puzzled, as did the other cultivators.</p><p></p><p>Jiang Yuan contemplated, "Since it's only the Demon Realm invading the Eastern Realm, it would be better for you two to quickly return to your own realms. Don't you fear that by the time you reach the Eastern Realm, the Devil Realm might have invaded the South, West, and North Realms? Then that Devil Sovereign... no one would be able to handle him."</p><p></p><p>Hearing this, everyone was shocked.</p><p></p><p>That's right, that was very possible. This was too obvious a ploy to lure them away!</p><p></p><p>Qin Miao and Liu Wu Su's brows furrowed.</p><p></p><p>Shen Jing Tao's heart sank as he urgently said, "Seniors, time is of the essence now!"</p><p></p><p>Qin Miao asked, "Then what does Jiang Fellow Daoist suggest?"</p><p></p><p>Jiang Yuan replied, "You two should return to your own realms first. As for the Eastern Realm, leave it to me, the Purple Extreme Thunder..."</p><p></p><p>Here is the full English translation of the Chinese excerpt:</p><p></p><p>As the leader of the Eastern Domain, Feng had an obligation that he could not shirk.</p><p></p><p>"Good!"</p><p></p><p>Qin Miaomiao and Liu Wusu looked at Jiang Yuan with admiration, then turned to the crowd of cultivators as vast as the sea and began to issue orders.</p><p></p><p>They selected a group of cultivators to reinforce the Eastern Domain, then had the rest return to their respective domains to strengthen the defenses and be vigilant against the invasion of the Demon Realm.</p><p></p><p>Soon, the area outside the Carefree Pavilion became deserted.</p><p></p><p>Only Qin Miaomiao, Liu Wusu, Jiang Yuan, and the seated figure of Lu Changsheng remained there.</p><p></p><p>"Hmm? Fellow Daoist Jiang, the situation is urgent, why are you still not leaving?" </p><p></p><p>Qin Miaomiao looked at Jiang Yuan with slight bewilderment and asked.</p><p></p><p>"Oh, I was just lost in thought just now, haha, I'll be leaving now. Farewell, fellow Daoists."</p><p></p><p>Jiang Yuan glanced at Lu Changsheng out of the corner of his eye, smiled, cupped his hands, and disappeared.</p><p></p><p>"Miss Qin, do you feel that there's something off about Fellow Daoist Jiang?"</p><p></p><p>Liu Wusu said suspiciously.</p><p></p><p>Qin Miaomiao nodded and sighed, "Yes, even though such a momentous event is happening in his own domain, he doesn't seem very anxious about it. He's even considering the other three domains for us. He wasn't this enthusiastic before."</p><p></p><p>Liu Wusu didn't think too much about it and said, "This matter has become quite serious. We should go back and be on guard against the Demon Realm. Yue Wuqing is no easy opponent."</p><p></p><p>"Mm, huh?"</p><p></p><p>After Qin Miaomiao responded, she noticed the figure of the man in blue sitting on the bench to the side. Her gaze flickered for a moment as she called out, "This fellow Daoist... uh."</p><p></p><p>But before she could finish speaking, the two of them saw the mysterious man in blue, along with the bench, dissipate like mist and vanish.</p><p></p><p>Qin Miaomiao and Liu Wusu stood there dumbfounded.</p><p></p><p>They pursed their lips, exchanged a greeting, and hurriedly left.</p><p></p><p>After they departed, </p><p></p><p>Jiang Yuan, who had previously left, suddenly reappeared. He looked at the spot where Lu Changsheng had been sitting, his gaze flickering.</p><p></p><p>"Hmm? Where's the person?"</p><p></p><p>...</p><p></p><p>Outside the Ascension Passage.</p><p></p><p>Zhang Youdao looked at the open passage with an expression of joy and melancholy.</p><p></p><p>After cultivating for over four thousand years, he was finally going to enter the legendary Immortal Realm.</p><p></p><p>Just as he was about to step in,</p><p></p><p>A figure in blue robes appeared at the entrance like a ghost, silently watching him.</p><p></p><p>Ah, it's him?</p><p></p><p>Zhang Youdao was momentarily confused, but soon recalled the scene on the stone platform earlier, where he had also noticed this young man, but had been preoccupied with impending tribulation and couldn't pay much attention.</p><p></p><p>"Fellow Daoist, what are you doing?" </p><p></p><p>Zhang Youdao asked somewhat uncertainly.</p><p></p><p>He thought Lu Changsheng might want to enter the Ascension Passage with him, but the passage had a restriction set by the Heavenly Dao - only those who had passed the Ascension Tribulation could enter, and others who tried would be mercilessly destroyed by the restriction.</p><p></p><p>Otherwise, Jiang Yuan, Qin Miaomiao, and the others would have followed right away!</p><p></p><p>"Fellow Daoist Lu!" </p><p></p><p>At this moment, Chu Xiran arrived belatedly.</p><p></p><p>Zhang Youdao was dumbfounded, looking at Chu Xiran: "You... you also want to enter the Ascension Passage?"</p><p></p><p>"Let's go."</p><p></p><p>Lu Changsheng said simply, turning to step into the passage.</p><p></p><p>Zhang Youdao's face paled, and he urgently shouted, "Fellow Daoist, don't! The Ascension Passage has a restriction set by the Heavenly Dao, only those who have passed the Ascension Tribulation can enter, you'll die... Huh?"</p><p></p><p>Towards the end, Zhang Youdao was utterly perplexed, for he saw Lu Changsheng entering the passage unharmed...</p><p></p><p>How could the restriction of the Ascension Passage not activate?</p><p></p><p>"I believe your name is Zhang Youdao, right? Consider yourself lucky to have encountered me and Fellow Daoist Lu, otherwise what awaits you on the other side of the passage is only death! What are you still standing there for, let's go?"</p><p></p><p>Chu Xiran said indifferently, then stepped into the Ascension Passage.</p><p></p><p>"Oh." Zhang Youdao dazedly followed them in.</p><p></p><p>Boom!</p><p></p><p>The Ascension Passage closed.</p>

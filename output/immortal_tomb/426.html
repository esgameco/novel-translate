        <h1>Chapter 426</h1>
        <div class="content">
            <p>Here is the full English translation of the Chinese excerpt:</p><p></p><p>On the eastern city wall, Cloud Zeshuang and the officials seemed to sense something, and they quickly looked up to see a beam of light descending towards them.</p><p></p><p>"Your Majesty, that is the Piercing Cloud Carriage!!" </p><p></p><p>An official exclaimed hurriedly.</p><p></p><p>The Piercing Cloud Carriage was the exclusive palace carriage of the Ninth Prince, Cloud Aoxie, which the officials were all too familiar with.</p><p></p><p>The officials knew that this meant the Ninth Prince and the Qin Saint had returned, and most importantly, the distinguished personage that His Majesty had mentioned should be in the carriage at this moment!</p><p></p><p>Cloud Zeshuang pursed his lips, even as the ruler of a nation, he also felt nervous at this moment.</p><p></p><p>After all, what Ye Xunwang had said earlier was too shocking.</p><p></p><p>For a mere servant to be able to crush them...</p><p></p><p>As for his younger brother's strength, Cloud Zeshuang was more familiar with it than anyone.</p><p></p><p>In the blink of an eye, the light flashed and slowly descended onto the city wall.</p><p></p><p>The first thing Cloud Zeshuang and the officials saw were Cloud Aoxie, Ye Xunwang and others outside the carriage, as well as a strange old man...</p><p></p><p>Cloud Zeshuang's gaze lingered on the old turtle for a moment, immediately guessing that this person must be the terrifying servant...</p><p></p><p>He then quickly shifted his gaze to the carriage, where a blurry figure was now visible behind the curtain.</p><p></p><p>At the same time, Cloud Zeshuang saw Ye Xunwang and his son frantically signaling to him with their eyes, and he quickly reacted, hurriedly bowing with the officials and saying:</p><p></p><p>"I am Cloud Zeshuang, the ruler of the ancient Cloud Lan Kingdom. Today, I have specially led the officials to welcome you, the arrival of the distinguished personage is a blessing for the capital city, and an even greater blessing for the ancient Cloud Lan Kingdom!"</p><p></p><p>On the carriage, apart from the listless old turtle, Cloud Aoxie and Ye Xunwang and the others also bowed.</p><p></p><p>Soon, the curtain was lifted, and Lu Changsheng walked out from it, looking at the robed Cloud Zeshuang and the officials before him, and said softly, "You may rise."</p><p></p><p>"Yes, distinguished personage." </p><p></p><p>Cloud Zeshuang's heart relaxed slightly, and he led the officials to rise, finally getting a clear look at the young man standing on the carriage, hands behind his back.</p><p></p><p>He was a young man, simple and unadorned, except for the gourd at his waist, with only his azure robe fluttering in the wind, making him seem even more transcendent.</p><p></p><p>Cloud Zeshuang and the others were stunned by Lu Changsheng's calm and unfathomable aura, and for a moment they didn't know what to say, nor dared they look into those deep eyes, just standing there stiffly.</p><p></p><p>Ye Xunwang saw this and quickly cleared his throat, saying, "Your Majesty, the distinguished personage must be weary from the journey, we should invite him to rest in the palace first."</p><p></p><p>Cloud Zeshuang quickly nodded and smiled, "Yes, yes, distinguished personage, please follow me..."</p><p></p><p>"Outrageous!! How dare you block my royal brother!!"</p><p></p><p>But before Cloud Zeshuang could finish his sentence, a furious shout suddenly came from a direction.</p><p></p><p>Immediately, Cloud Zeshuang's expression changed slightly, and Ye Xunwang, Cloud Aoxie, and many officials also stiffened.</p><p></p><p>Anyone could tell that this was the voice of the Crown Prince, Cloud Aotong.</p><p></p><p>Well, what was the Crown Prince trying to do in this situation? Was he looking for trouble?</p><p></p><p>Wasn't the King's order that no one was allowed to approach this place?</p><p></p><p>Now it's done, it must have left a bad impression on the young man in azure!</p><p></p><p>Cloud Zeshuang looked at Lu Changsheng, his face slightly pale, and said with difficulty, "Distinguished personage..."</p><p></p><p>A faint smile appeared on Lu Changsheng's face as he said, "It's fine, you deal with it first, there's no hurry."</p><p></p><p>Seeing that Lu Changsheng was not angry, the people instantly relaxed their tense nerves!</p><p></p><p>Their situation was exactly the same as when Cloud Aoxie and Ye Xunwang had descended upon the Heavenly Fragrance City, with Guo Xiong and Zhu Guoyuan.</p><p></p><p>They were afraid of making Lu Changsheng uncomfortable in any way.</p><p></p><p>"Yes, the distinguished personage is magnanimous." Cloud Zeshuang cupped his hands and forced a smile, then his expression darkened as he shouted, "Bring that rebellious son, Cloud Aotong, to me!"</p><p></p><p>The officials trembled, inwardly understanding that the Crown Prince was truly in trouble this time, as this was the first time they had heard the King address any prince by their full name, which showed how enraged he was.</p><p></p><p>The officials guessed that if it weren't for the presence of the young man in azure, the King would have unleashed his fury, but now he could not do so.</p><p></p><p>At the same time,</p><p></p><p>"Crown Prince, the King has ordered us to bring you over."</p><p></p><p>Two imperial guards received the order and headed towards the Crown Prince Cloud Aotong.</p><p></p><p>Here is the full English translation of the Chinese excerpt:</p><p></p><p>Ao Chong said.</p><p></p><p>Cloud Ao Chong was suddenly delighted, looking at the two imperial guards, spreading his hands and shouting: "Keep blocking this prince, why don't you block me anymore???"</p><p></p><p>The two imperial guards were slightly taken aback, of course they didn't dare say anything.</p><p></p><p>Although they were directly under Cloud Ze Cang, who knows if this guy in front of them might become the crown prince in the future.</p><p></p><p>"Hehe."</p><p></p><p>Cloud Ao Chong sneered when he saw this, and then said to the subordinate behind him, "You wait here, this prince is going to see the father king first."</p><p></p><p>The subordinate heard this, his expression became solemn as he replied, "Yes, Your Highness."</p><p></p><p>In fact, the subordinate's heart immediately relaxed, who would want to follow the prince to see the king? </p><p></p><p>He dared to bet that the prince's trip would definitely not end well.</p><p></p><p>However, he didn't dare to persuade him, because even if he persuaded the prince, the prince wouldn't listen, and in the end he would still get scolded, which was not worth it.</p><p></p><p>Forget it, forget it.</p><p></p><p>"Let's go," Cloud Ao Chong said disdainfully, and then followed the two imperial guards towards the eastern city wall.</p><p></p><p>Soon, the two Cloud Ao Chongs followed the two imperial guards to the top of the city wall.</p><p></p><p>The two imperial guards bowed and retreated.</p><p></p><p>A smile appeared on Cloud Ao Chong's face, and in the midst of the strange gazes of the crowd, he strode up to Cloud Ze Cang and knelt down to salute:</p><p></p><p>"Father King, your son has arrived late!"</p><p></p><p>The crowd: "......"</p><p></p><p>Cloud Ao Xie looked at his elder brother speechlessly and sighed in his heart.</p><p></p><p>As the crown prince, his elder brother was born with great advantages and had a high chance of becoming the crown prince in the future, but his brother's brain seemed to have been malfunctioning all along...</p><p></p><p>Always doing things that even the Father King finds unbelievable.</p><p></p><p>Today, another incident has been added.</p><p></p><p>Cloud Ze Cang stared at the still smiling Cloud Ao Chong and said indifferently, "What are you here for?"</p><p></p><p>Hearing this, a carefree expression appeared on Cloud Ao Chong's face, and an atmosphere of desolation and coldness permeated around him. He sincerely said:</p><p></p><p>"Your son guesses that the Father King has some troublesome matters, so I want to come and help the Father King resolve the difficulties."</p><p></p><p>Cloud Ze Cang finally couldn't hold back anymore, and slapped him!</p><p></p><p>Slap!</p><p></p><p>Cloud Ao Chong was slapped and spun on the spot!</p><p></p><p>After stopping, Cloud Ao Chong covered his face and looked at Cloud Ze Cang in a daze.</p><p></p><p>Cloud Ao Chong now felt no pain at all, only endless bewilderment.</p><p></p><p>What did he do wrong? Why did the Father King slap him in front of the officials?</p><p></p><p>And the next moment, an even more shocking and terrifying thing happened!</p><p></p><p>Cloud Ze Cang stared at him and coldly said, "Guards, throw the Crown Prince into the dungeon!"</p><p></p><p>Ah?</p><p></p><p>Cloud Ao Chong's face turned pale, he staggered, and looked at his father the king in incomprehension!</p><p></p><p>What, what happened? </p><p></p><p>Why can't he understand today's events at all?</p><p></p><p>The next moment, two imperial guards appeared, the same two as before, one on the left and one on the right, grabbing Cloud Ao Chong and preparing to take him to the dungeon.</p><p></p><p>"There's no need for that."</p><p></p><p>Suddenly, Lu Changsheng spoke up.</p><p></p><p>In Lu Changsheng's view, this was a bit of an overreaction.</p><p></p><p>"Yes, sir!" Cloud Ze Cang was startled, not expecting the great man to be so magnanimous, so he immediately waved his hand to stop the imperial guards.</p><p></p><p>Cloud Ao Chong stared blankly at the young man in blue, until now he had only just noticed this stranger...</p><p></p><p>Cloud Ao Chong looked at his father's cautious manner, and then observed the positioning of the people here, only to realize that the young man in blue was the core figure here.</p><p></p><p>It turned out that Father King had brought the officials to this Eastern Gate to welcome this great man who had descended on the capital?</p><p></p><p>Cloud Ao Chong suddenly realized, and his heart sank.</p><p></p><p>Even if he was spared from going to prison today, after this incident, the position of crown prince was basically out of his reach.</p><p></p><p>It's all over, everything is over.</p><p></p><p>Oh, not necessarily, if he could get on good terms with this young man in blue, maybe there's a chance for a revival?</p><p></p><p>Cloud Ao Chong suddenly had a flash of inspiration!</p>

        <h1>Chapter 304</h1>
        <div class="content">
            <p>Here is the full English translation of the Chinese excerpt:</p><p></p><p>Li Shuyan's gaze changed, and just as he was about to punch the Evil Monk's forehead, he was shocked to find that his fist couldn't land at all!</p><p></p><p>The Evil Monk knew it was the Sect Master's doing, and immediately took the opportunity to hastily retreat, putting some distance between himself and Li Shuyan.</p><p></p><p>Whoosh!</p><p></p><p>The next moment, the Blood Demon Sect Master appeared before Li Shuyan, expressionless, and said:</p><p></p><p>"How dare you try to kill my Sect Holy Son?"</p><p></p><p>Li Shuyan's eyes were shrouded in gloom, knowing that the person before him was extremely powerful, and not someone he could contend with, so he quickly put some distance between them.</p><p></p><p>"Trying to run away?" The Blood Demon Sect Master sneered coldly.</p><p></p><p>But just then, Duan Jiuniong appeared in front of Li Shuyan, his face gloomy, and said:</p><p></p><p>"Blood Old Demon, the Heavenly Prodigy Assembly was initiated by the Ancient Wasteland Sword Clan. Not only have you violated the rules, but you also want to attack one of the Heavenly Prodigies?"</p><p></p><p>At this moment, the entire venue was deathly silent.</p><p></p><p>No one had expected the situation to escalate to a confrontation between the Blood Demon Sect Master and Duan City Lord, two top-tier experts.</p><p></p><p>The Nangong Clan, the Assassin Tower, the Wang City Black Tribe, the Miao Tribe, the Zhou Tribe, and other major forces were all silent, their gazes flickering, each with their own thoughts.</p><p></p><p>Miu Hantian, Liu Tu, and others glanced covertly at Lu Changsheng in the tea gathering, only to see him still sitting there calmly and unperturbed.</p><p></p><p>As for the Heavenly Prodigies, they were actually quite displeased.</p><p></p><p>Li Shuyan had defeated the Evil Monk, but the Blood Demon Sect Master forcibly intervened and even wanted to attack Li Shuyan?</p><p></p><p>This was simply disregarding the rules of the Heavenly Prodigy Assembly.</p><p></p><p>"City Lord Duan, you don't need to use the rules of the Heavenly Prodigy Assembly to pressure my Sect. Everyone knows what the Heavenly Prodigy Assembly means to the Ancient Wasteland Sword Clan - they only need ten Sword Servants. Do you think the Ancient Wasteland Sword Clan would bother with such a small matter?"</p><p></p><p>"What? City Lord Duan, are you going to confront my Blood Demon Sect for the sake of a Heavenly Prodigy at the Divine Yang Realm? I believe you understand the pros and cons well enough..."</p><p></p><p>The Blood Demon Sect Master spoke calmly, facing Duan Jiuniong without the slightest hint of fear.</p><p></p><p>Duan Jiuniong fell silent, then said, "Blood Old Demon, this is no ordinary Heavenly Prodigy at the Divine Yang Realm. A Heavenly Prodigy at the early Divine Yang Realm defeating your Sect Holy Son... Doesn't that tell you enough?"</p><p></p><p>The Blood Demon Sect Master's eyes flickered.</p><p></p><p>Indeed, to be able to cultivate such a Heavenly Prodigy, he couldn't help but doubt that this person had no background at all in the Divine Yang Realm.</p><p></p><p>Recalling the tyrannical nature of his physique earlier, his gaze and heart stirred slightly.</p><p></p><p>This Heavenly Prodigy should not be from the Ancient Wasteland Ruins, but perhaps from a different region of the Eternal Celestial Realm.</p><p></p><p>He then looked at Li Shuyan deeply and indifferently turned around, "Forget it, this Sect Master won't bother with a junior."</p><p></p><p>With that, he prepared to return to the audience seats.</p><p></p><p>Duan Jiuniong saw this and inwardly breathed a sigh of relief, knowing that the Blood Old Demon was now somewhat wary.</p><p></p><p>Just as everyone thought the matter had been temporarily resolved,</p><p></p><p>Li Shuyan spoke up in a calm voice, "Hold on!"</p><p></p><p>Everyone's hearts skipped a beat!</p><p></p><p>The Blood Demon Sect Master's footsteps paused, and his brow furrowed.</p><p></p><p>The Evil Monk, seeing this, had a mocking smile on his face.</p><p></p><p>"Oh? What does this junior want to say?" The Blood Demon Sect Master turned around and looked at Li Shuyan indifferently.</p><p></p><p>Li Shuyan looked at the startled Duan Jiuniong, "City Lord Duan, if I was in absolute disadvantage in my battle with the Evil Monk, what would have been the outcome?"</p><p></p><p>Duan Jiuniong: "Death..."</p><p></p><p>Li Shuyan reverted to his original appearance and pointed at the Evil Monk, "Then why is he still alive?"</p><p></p><p>Duan Jiuniong fell silent.</p><p></p><p>But inwardly, he sighed and transmitted a message, "Little fellow, what background do you have? Or rather, is your background in the Ancient Wasteland Ruins? The Blood Demon Sect's status in the Ancient Wasteland Ruins is even above that of the major forces."</p><p></p><p>Li Shuyan heard this and looked at the Blood Demon Sect Master, coldly smiling:</p><p></p><p>"As a top-tier force, not only do you control the tea gathering, but you also break the rules of the Heavenly Prodigy battle. With so many major forces watching, you Blood Demon Sect truly lacks the bearing of a major force..."</p><p></p><p>"Can't accept the loss!!"</p><p></p><p>Ah!</p><p></p><p>The crowd in the plaza was startled, not expecting Li Shuyan to say these words.</p><p></p><p>This was essentially pointing at the Blood Demon Sect Master's nose and cursing him!</p><p></p><p>Li Shuyan's strength was indeed top-tier, but he was a bit impulsive and lacked the sophistication of worldly affairs.</p><p></p><p>Today, it seems...</p><p></p><p>Here is the full English translation of the Chinese excerpt:</p><p></p><p>It was difficult to walk out of the Heavenly Emperor's Assembly alive...</p><p></p><p>www.shu69.com</p><p></p><p>Sure enough, everyone saw the Blood Demon Sect Master's face turn pitch black!</p><p></p><p>Duan Jiunong's mouth twitched as he pulled Li Shuyan behind him and smiled, "Blood Old Demon, this matter is over. You forcibly interfered with the duel, and the junior's heart is a bit angry, which is understandable, isn't it?"</p><p></p><p>"Duan Jiunong, this Sect Master has already shown you a lot of face. What happens next, you'd better not get involved."</p><p></p><p>The Blood Demon Sect Master didn't even look at Duan Jiunong, but stared straight at Li Shuyan.</p><p></p><p>He believed that since he had said so, Duan Jiunong should not interfere anymore.</p><p></p><p>Who knew that Duan Jiunong coldly smiled, "Blood Old Demon, you're giving my City Lord face? From the beginning until now, you've been manipulating the Tea Talk Assembly and forcibly interfering with the duel. Isn't it my City Lord who has been giving you face all along?"</p><p></p><p>He could no longer hold back. This was no longer just about protecting Li Shuyan.</p><p></p><p>It was about his own reputation!</p><p></p><p>He had given the Blood Old Demon face time and time again, but this Blood Old Demon was really trampling his face into the ground!</p><p></p><p>After all, he, Duan Jiunong, was the one appointed by the Ancient Wasteland Sword Clan to preside over the Heavenly Emperor's Assembly. If Li Shuyan was killed by the Blood Demon in front of him today, what reputation would he, Duan Jiunong, have left?</p><p></p><p>The Blood Demon Sect Master paused, his face darkening slightly. Duan Jiunong today seemed to want to fight for face with him, and then he said:</p><p></p><p>"Assassin Tower Master, help this Sect Master stop Duan Jiunong. This little trash must die today!"</p><p></p><p>At these words, everyone was shocked again!</p><p></p><p>Immediately, they saw the Assassin Tower Master appear in front of Duan Jiunong, "City Lord, you'd better just watch."</p><p></p><p>Duan Jiunong's face looked utterly unsightly. He had already seen earlier that the Blood Old Demon and the Assassin Tower Master were secretly colluding. He then glanced at Li Shuyan, his eyes full of helplessness.</p><p></p><p>Today, this Heavenly Emperor might not be saved, and he, Duan Jiunong, was destined to lose face.</p><p></p><p>"Hehe..."</p><p></p><p>The Blood Demon Sect Master slowly walked towards the wary Li Shuyan and sneered, "This Sect Master doesn't care if you are a Heavenly Emperor from any domain of the Eternal Celestial Capital. Since you've come to the Ancient Wasteland Ruins, you should just obediently follow the principle that the mighty dragon does not oppress the local snake, don't you understand?"</p><p></p><p>He believed that Li Shuyan came from a powerful clan, but as long as he was not from one of the Eight Ancient Clans, he was not afraid!</p><p></p><p>The atmosphere in the entire venue became tense at this moment, and everyone stared intently at Li Shuyan, feeling a sense of pity.</p><p></p><p>Just then, another person appeared in the venue, standing in front of Li Shuyan...</p><p></p><p>It was Miu Hantian!</p><p></p><p>The crowd was confused, feeling their minds in a muddle. They could not understand the scene unfolding before them today.</p><p></p><p>"Miu Hantian? What do you mean?" The Blood Demon Sect Master's eyes narrowed, mocking.</p><p></p><p>Miu Hantian's pupils flickered as he cupped his hands and smiled, "Blood Sect Master, this child has an old connection with my Miu Clan. Please do Miu a favor."</p><p></p><p>Of course Li Shuyan had absolutely no connection with his Miu Clan!</p><p></p><p>But Miu Hantian was not an idiot!</p><p></p><p>At this moment, this was the best time to cling to the coattails of the Venerable Azure Robe. He had waited so long, and he was waiting for this moment!!</p><p></p><p>Even if he was no match for the Blood Old Demon!</p><p></p><p>"Hehe, favor? You, a king city's major clan, dare to come to this Sect Master asking for a favor? You want to die, and this Sect Master will oblige you!"</p><p></p><p>The Blood Demon Sect Master laughed angrily, and immediately two divine shadow figures flashed behind him, fiercely slapping towards Miu Hantian and Li Shuyan!</p><p></p><p>This slap was majestic, shattering the space and ground of the square, directly locking onto Miu Hantian and Li Shuyan!</p><p></p><p>Miu Hantian's gaze was extremely grave, and a divine shadow figure rose behind him, but facing the Blood Old Demon's attack, he had no confidence at all!</p><p></p><p>The gap between one divine shadow and two divine shadows was too great!</p><p></p><p>His peripheral vision frantically looked towards the corner of the Tea Talk Assembly, his heart frantically calling out, "Venerable, please hurry and lend a hand, little Miu can't hold on!"</p><p></p><p>The next moment, a huge explosion resounded, which everyone in the Ancient Wasteland City could hear!</p><p></p><p>"Boom!!!"</p><p></p><p>But the crowd was startled to see that it was the Blood Demon Sect Master who was blown away!</p><p></p><p>Somehow, a bronze-masked Venerable Azure Robe cultivator had appeared in front of Miu Hantian and Li Shuyan, hands clasped behind his back, his robes fluttering.</p><p></p><p>The crowd stiffly looked over, their pupils suddenly contracting into needle-like shapes, their expressions as if they had seen a ghost in broad daylight!</p><p></p><p>That... that Venerable Emperor Realm Heavenly Emperor!</p><p></p><p>The entire audience was shocked!!</p>

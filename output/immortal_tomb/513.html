        <h1>Chapter 513</h1>
        <div class="content">
            <p>Here is the full English translation of the Chinese excerpt:</p><p></p><p>After a moment, under Xin Xia's gaze, she obediently reported as Lu Changsheng had instructed.</p><p></p><p>"My lord, I have reported as per your instructions, but due to the distance, it will take some time."  Xin Xia said softly.</p><p></p><p>Lu Changsheng nodded slightly and smiled, "Well done."</p><p></p><p>Seeing this, Xin Xia felt a bit relieved. As long as she was not subjected to that living hell of torment, everything would be fine. She then resolutely said, "Since that is the case, please, my lord, grant me an end."</p><p></p><p>Lu Changsheng suddenly looked at Xin Xia and said indifferently, "How do you think your Xikong Saint Demon Clan's chances are against me?"</p><p></p><p>Xin Xia was silent for a moment before solemnly replying, "My lord is unrivaled in this world, so naturally the Xikong Saint Demon Clan has no chance of victory."</p><p></p><p>"But it seems that is not how you truly feel." Lu Changsheng said calmly, "Don't be afraid, I won't torment you with the Dao Venerable Voice again, so please speak the truth."</p><p></p><p>Xin Xia swallowed and said in a deep voice, "My lord is the master of this void, so you are indeed very powerful to me. But our Xikong Saint Demon Clan is invincible, and has never met its match. In our clan alone, there are eight Saint Demon Gods, my lord... I'm afraid you have no chance of victory."</p><p></p><p>Suddenly, the Dao Venerable Voice exploded in Xin Xia's mind!</p><p></p><p>"Ahâ€”" Xin Xia let out a miserable scream.</p><p></p><p>"The things you said, I don't like to hear." Lu Changsheng's eyes flashed with an eerie blue light as he said mockingly.</p><p></p><p>At this moment, Xin Xia's head was splitting with pain, and she fell to the ground, convulsing uncontrollably, having no mind to speak.</p><p></p><p>Otherwise, Xin Xia really wanted to ask, "My lord, didn't you say you wouldn't torment me anymore?! That's not playing fair!"</p><p></p><p>Lu Changsheng chuckled and with a wave of his sleeve, erased Xin Xia.</p><p></p><p>Suddenly, it was quiet.</p><p></p><p>"Thank you, my lord! Thank you, my lord!!"</p><p></p><p>The living beings regained their senses and prostrated themselves, tears streaming down their faces.</p><p></p><p>"Thank you, Venerable Dao Master!"</p><p></p><p>The Dao of the Crimson Mysterious Heaven also finally appeared at this moment, kowtowing with tears of gratitude.</p><p></p><p>It had been too long, too long. He had always lived in fear, because that Xin Xia was truly too powerful, and as the Dao, he was utterly helpless against her.</p><p></p><p>"Go and repair this world properly."</p><p></p><p>Lu Changsheng said indifferently, then tore open space, waving his sleeve to sweep Old Turtle and the others into the void, making them disappear.</p><p></p><p>...</p><p></p><p>In a hidden place in the Crimson Mysterious Heaven, there was a glowing giant vortex slowly rotating.</p><p></p><p>Suddenly, a crack opened in the surrounding space, and Lu Changsheng and the others stepped out.</p><p></p><p>"Master, is this the transmission wormhole you spoke of?" Old Turtle asked in amazement as he examined the giant vortex.</p><p></p><p>Hunpo and the others also had curious expressions.</p><p></p><p>This type of transmission formation was something they had never seen before.</p><p></p><p>Moreover, this transmission wormhole was clearly more powerful than a transmission formation. After all, it could transmit within the Creation Pillar, which was an incredibly terrifying distance!</p><p></p><p>Their transmission formations could never achieve that!</p><p></p><p>All the signs indicated that the Xikong Saint Demon Clan was indeed a very advanced existence, far surpassing their endless void civilization.</p><p></p><p>"Yes, this is the transmission wormhole," Lu Changsheng said with a faint smile.</p><p></p><p>"Master, where is our next destination?" Old Turtle asked again.</p><p></p><p>Lu Changsheng narrowed his eyes, "Of course, it's to the top of the Creation Pillar for the final battle. The Saint Demon Gods of the Xikong Clan are not fools. After learning of my identity, they will certainly not let some small fry come and throw their lives away. They must have ordered all the Saint Demons to withdraw to the top of the Creation Pillar."</p><p></p><p>As he said this, Lu Changsheng turned and looked into the void, speaking meaningfully, "And what's more, you may not believe this... After I killed that Xin Xia, there seemed to be a pair of gazes, projected from an incredibly distant place, as if they were observing me..."</p><p></p><p>As his words fell, Old Turtle, Hunpo, and the others shuddered, their bodies becoming restless as they frantically scanned their surroundings, but could detect nothing!</p><p></p><p>A sense of dread had arisen in their hearts!</p><p></p><p>"You all go into the tower first, and when I reach the top of the Creation Pillar, I'll let you out again," Lu Changsheng said, preparing to draw them into the tower.</p><p></p><p>Hunpo suddenly said dejectedly, "Venerable Dao Master, originally we came to help you, but looking at the situation now, we may only end up being a burden to you..."</p><p></p><p>The Qilin and Pixiu also lowered their heads, their mood extremely heavy.</p><p></p><p>As for He Xitong, she stood to the side, not feeling much of anything. After all, she was originally weak, and the Master had brought her along because of her Myriad World Calamity Body. As long as there was a place where her Myriad World Calamity Body could be of use in the future, she would be content, even if it meant sacrificing herself.</p><p></p><p>Lu Changsheng waved his hand and smiled, "The Xikong Saint Demon Clan is indeed stronger than expected, but don't be discouraged, it's not as serious as you think."</p><p></p><p>Here is the full English translation of the Chinese excerpt:</p><p></p><p>"The Devouring Space Saint Demon Tribe is strong in two aspects - first, their physical bodies are extremely tough, and second, they have no sense of pain."</p><p></p><p>"Since they have no sense of pain, their combat power is greatly enhanced. However, as long as you can find a way to damage their minds, they are not that formidable."</p><p></p><p>Lu Changsheng briefly explained the weaknesses of the Devouring Space Saint Demons.</p><p></p><p>Old Turtle and Hunhui finally breathed a sigh of relief and regained their confidence.</p><p></p><p>They had not fought against that Xinxia before, but seeing how Lu Changsheng casually snapped Xinxia's arm without him feeling any pain at all had truly shocked them.</p><p></p><p>"Alright, you all may enter the tower now. There is still quite some time left, so you can further improve your strength."</p><p></p><p>After saying that, Lu Changsheng sent the group into the tower.</p><p></p><p>He then turned around and stepped into the teleportation worm hole!</p><p></p><p>...</p><p></p><p>At the same time, within the Eighth Creation Pillar,</p><p></p><p>The Devouring Space Saint Demons from various mother star systems all received the order from the Saint Demon God to head towards the top of the Creation Pillar through the teleportation worm holes.</p><p></p><p>Most of them did not know what had happened, only knowing to obey the order!</p><p></p><p>However, the Devouring Space Saint Demons from the mother star systems closer to where Xinxia was previously knew what had occurred.</p><p></p><p>Enraged, they originally planned to go to Xinxia's mother star system, the Crimson Profound Heavens, to avenge him!</p><p></p><p>What "Master of the Endless Void"? They didn't even care about that at all!</p><p></p><p>But they suddenly received the order from the Saint Demon God, and had no choice but to reluctantly teleport towards the top of the Creation Pillar instead.</p><p></p><p>...</p><p></p><p>At the top of the Eighth Creation Pillar.</p><p></p><p>Here, there were no more star systems or worlds, only boundless and profound vastness, like an ancient battlefield of gods and demons, but far vaster, completely on a different scale.</p><p></p><p>In the highest space, there was a silver-white boundless barrier!</p><p></p><p>As if breaking through this barrier would allow one to reach beyond the Endless Void!</p><p></p><p>Suddenly, an endless army of Devouring Space Saint Demons flapped their wings and surged towards the depths, their expressions solemn and reverent, completely silent.</p><p></p><p>After flying for a long time, the Devouring Space Saint Demon army arrived outside a crystal-white palace, kneeling down in a grand manner.</p><p></p><p>"Greetings, Great Saint Demon God!"</p><p></p><p>In the next moment, a gigantic Devouring Space Saint Demon appeared on the palace roof, wearing a white-gold crown and with seven pairs of wings flapping behind it, its aura utterly imposing.</p><p></p><p>Seville expressionlessly said, "After all the tribes from the mother star systems have withdrawn, have them gather here to offer all the energy they have obtained to this god. Also, I have already contacted the other seven Saint Demon Gods to come to the Eighth Creation Pillar."</p><p></p><p>As soon as he finished speaking, all the Saint Demons looked up with astonishment and doubt on their faces.</p><p></p><p>Seville sneered.</p><p></p><p>"The Patriarch of this Void has arrived, trying to obstruct us from destroying the Creation Pillar, trying to save his brother and the myriad lives, haha haha!"</p><p></p><p>The Devouring Space Saint Demons hesitated for a moment, afraid of displeasing Seville, and also joined in the laughter "haha haha!"</p><p></p><p>Although they did not know what they were laughing about, it did not prevent them from laughing.</p><p></p><p>"What are you laughing at?! Do you think that Patriarch is easy to deal with? Otherwise, I would not have summoned the other seven Saint Demon Gods!!"</p><p></p><p>Seville suddenly roared, and the laughter of the Devouring Space Saint Demons immediately ceased.</p><p></p><p>"What? Are you afraid? With me and the other seven Saint Demon Gods here, that Patriarch is nothing! So why are you not laughing?"</p><p></p><p>Seville suddenly grinned widely.</p><p></p><p>The Devouring Space Saint Demons were dumbfounded, opening their mouths but unable to laugh, not knowing what to do.</p><p></p><p>"A bunch of useless trash!" Seville cursed seeing this.</p><p></p><p>Devouring Space Saint Demons: "......"</p><p></p><p>Seville indifferently said, "In less than a million years, that Patriarch will come here, and then it will be the decisive battle - no, I should say, a one-sided massacre."</p><p></p><p>As he spoke, Seville spread his claws, and a flash of light appeared, producing countless crystal balls in front of him. He then flung the crystal balls towards the Devouring Space Saint Demon army, sneering, "Master of the Endless Void? How ridiculous!"</p><p></p><p>"After you all leave, immediately scatter the Projection Crystals of the Myriad Realms throughout the Endless Void, using the extreme speed of the crystals. A million years should be enough time to cover most of the Void!"</p><p></p><p>"He wants to keep it a secret, but I want everyone to know about it!!"</p><p></p><p>"Before this limitless Void collapses, I will let all beings witness the wretched state of your Patriarch! Haha haha haha!"</p><p></p><p>"Daring to go against my Devouring Space Saint Demon Tribe, I will make him die! Die in utmost humiliation!!"</p><p></p><p>"This Void, and all living beings in it, shall also perish!!"</p>

        <h1>Chapter 20</h1>
        <div class="content">
            <p>Here is the full English translation of the Chinese excerpt:</p><p></p><p>Hmm?</p><p></p><p>The King of Lishui furrowed his brows, and the officials also exchanged glances. </p><p></p><p>Seeing this, Dong Ge glanced at the King of Lishui's expression, and hastily stood up, squinting his eyes at Chen Dadao and shouting,</p><p></p><p>"Little Chen, what's wrong with entering the courtyard? It's an honor for the King to hold an early meeting here, you should quickly step aside! Don't block the King's path."</p><p></p><p>Chen Dadao nodded at Dong Ge, thanking him for the good intentions, but still firmly stated, "The King cannot enter here."</p><p></p><p>Dong Ge paused, and with a sigh, said no more.</p><p></p><p>The expression on the King of Lishui's face fluctuated for a moment, but then he suddenly smiled and asked while looking into the courtyard, "Why?"</p><p></p><p>Chen Dadao's expression was conflicted, without the clever steward by his side, he couldn't think of a suitable reason at the moment!</p><p></p><p>"Could it be that your Garrison Master's Mansion is hiding some secret? Today, I the King must go in and take a look."</p><p></p><p>The King of Lishui indifferently glanced at Chen Dadao, then led the officials into the courtyard...</p><p></p><p>Yesterday, he still thought this Garrison Master Chen was not bad, worthy of great use, but today he has the audacity to defy him!</p><p></p><p>Chen Dadao snapped out of his daze, only to find that the King of Lishui and the officials had already entered the outer courtyard!</p><p></p><p>He hurriedly rushed in, urgently shouting, "Your Majesty, you cannot enter, you cannot enter!"</p><p></p><p>Of course, the King of Lishui heard his low roar, but he ignored it, and was even prepared to punish this Garrison Master!</p><p></p><p>This is simply disrespectful!</p><p></p><p>But soon, the King of Lishui and the officials halted in their steps, staring blankly at the man in blue robes fishing in the pavilion.</p><p></p><p>His figure was as motionless as a sculpture, exuding a sense of detachment from the world.</p><p></p><p>That demeanor, they were all too familiar with - the aura of an immortal!</p><p></p><p>Even compared to the immortals they had seen before, his aura seemed purer, more ethereal!</p><p></p><p>At this time, Chen Dadao anxiously ran to Luchang Sheng's side, kneeling and trembling as he said,</p><p></p><p>"Sir, I really couldn't stop the King and his men... I've disturbed your tranquility, and I deserve to be executed for my crime!"</p><p></p><p>The outer courtyard fell silent.</p><p></p><p>The King of Lishui and the officials were all staring blankly at this scene, and soon, a sense of trepidation arose in their hearts.</p><p></p><p>They were not fools, and in just a moment, they understood the whole situation.</p><p></p><p>The King of Lishui now hated this Chen Dadao!</p><p></p><p>If he had just directly said there was an immortal here, he wouldn't have dared to boldly enter with so many officials!</p><p></p><p>Nor would they be in this predicament now!</p><p></p><p>"We pay our respects to the Immortal!"</p><p></p><p>The King of Lishui hurriedly led the officials in bowing down.</p><p></p><p>The King of Lishui trembled as he said, "We did not know the Immortal was here, and barged in so brazenly. Please forgive us!"</p><p></p><p>Chen Dadao watched as the King of Lishui, who had been so high and mighty just a moment ago, now became so frightened, and his respect for Luchang Sheng grew even deeper.</p><p></p><p>Involuntarily, his desire to cultivate the Dao also became stronger, but... it seems he no longer has the chance.</p><p></p><p>If time could turn back, and he could choose again, he would still make the same choice as before!</p><p></p><p>He... has no regrets.</p><p></p><p>"You may rise," Luchang Sheng said lightly, gazing at the water.</p><p></p><p>"Thank you, Sir!" Chen Dadao let out a big sigh of relief and slowly stood up.</p><p></p><p>"We thank the Immortal!"</p><p></p><p>The King of Lishui and the officials were also delighted, and prepared to stand up...</p><p></p><p>But soon their faces turned pale, as they found that no matter how hard they tried, their knees could not leave the ground, let alone stand up.</p><p></p><p>"Did I tell you to stand up?" Luchang Sheng spoke softly.</p><p></p><p>The King of Lishui and the others trembled inwardly.</p><p></p><p>Indeed, he is an Immortal. Without even moving, he has suppressed them.</p><p></p><p>After that, they dared not speak further, afraid that at this moment, any words might incur his wrath.</p><p></p><p>Here is the full English translation of the excerpt from the Chinese novel:</p><p></p><p>Causing more trouble with careless words.</p><p></p><p>New 69 Book Bar 99shu.com</p><p></p><p>"Go kneel outside the courtyard, kneel for half an hour and then leave on your own." Lü Changsheng said as he pulled the rod.</p><p></p><p>"The immortal is magnanimous."</p><p></p><p>Seeing that the immortal did not hold it against them, the King of the Water Nation and the others were pleasantly surprised and gratefully bowed before quickly getting up and kneeling outside the courtyard.</p><p></p><p>Soon, the pavilion was left with only Lü Changsheng and Chen Dadao.</p><p></p><p>"You should leave as well," Lü Changsheng said.</p><p></p><p>Chen Dadao looked outside for a while, then bent over and trembled as he said, "M-master, having the king and the others kneel like this, if others see it, wouldn't that be improper... It was my fault for not explaining it clearly to them in the beginning."</p><p></p><p>Lü Changsheng's gaze shifted, he put down the rod and looked at him for a moment before saying, "In this world, I don't care who is right or wrong, I only know that whoever affects my elegance will be punished, it's that simple."</p><p></p><p>Chen Dadao's pupils shrank, and he was so frightened that he knelt down again.</p><p></p><p>"Moreover, it's just a minor punishment. But do you have the qualifications to question my decision?" </p><p></p><p>Lü Changsheng looked down at the kneeling Chen Dadao with a calm expression.</p><p></p><p>Under these utterly indifferent words!</p><p></p><p>Chen Dadao felt as if he had fallen into a thunderous place, his whole body numb and terrified!</p><p></p><p>"Master, I was careless in my speech, I..."</p><p></p><p>Before Chen Dadao could finish, Lü Changsheng had already turned around, picked up the fishing rod, and said indifferently, "You go kneel with them as well."</p><p></p><p>Chen Dadao bowed his head in shame: "Yes."</p><p></p><p>...</p><p></p><p>Outside the courtyard.</p><p></p><p>The sun was starting to get hotter.</p><p></p><p>The King of the Water Nation and the officials were puzzled to see Chen Dadao also come and kneel with them.</p><p></p><p>Dong Ge was quick-witted, and after discreetly observing the King of the Water Nation's expression, he realized the king's thoughts, so he looked at Chen Dadao and quietly asked, "Dadao, why are you kneeling with us too?"</p><p></p><p>Hearing this, the King of the Water Nation was slightly satisfied, as Dong Ge had asked the question he had in mind.</p><p></p><p>Chen Dadao saw everyone looking at him, so he quickly turned his eyes and said pitifully, "I was wrong in the first place, and I feel ashamed in my heart, so I came to ask the master for punishment and kneel with you all."</p><p></p><p>Chen Dadao was not stupid, he had offended the king earlier, so of course he had to say some good words now.</p><p></p><p>Ah, this...</p><p></p><p>At this moment, the King of the Water Nation and the officials were moved.</p><p></p><p>This little Moyu Zhen Lord was actually so sincere!!</p><p></p><p>It was they who had been narrow-minded.</p><p></p><p>The King of the Water Nation awkwardly shifted his knees, moved closer to Chen Dadao, and patted his shoulder, saying, "I didn't misjudge you, but why didn't you tell me earlier that there was an immortal living in your mansion? If you had told me, I naturally wouldn't have dared to disturb the immortal."</p><p></p><p>Chen Dadao said bitterly, "Your Majesty, you don't know, the master always likes to be alone... I, I!"</p><p></p><p>Hearing this, the King of the Water Nation sighed and patted Chen Dadao's shoulder again, indicating that he could understand.</p><p></p><p>Indeed, putting himself in the other's shoes, he would have done the same.</p><p></p><p>"I see!!!"</p><p></p><p>At this moment, Dong Ge on the side suddenly let out a low roar, his expression excited!</p><p></p><p>This startled everyone!</p><p></p><p>The King of the Water Nation quickly looked at the courtyard, then glared at Dong Ge and even called out his name angrily:</p><p></p><p>"Dong Ge! What's wrong with you? Do you want to get us all killed? Can't you keep your voice down? If you disturb the immortal, you'll be waiting for death!"</p><p></p><p>Dong Ge also came to his senses, drenched in sweat, and trembled as he said, "Y-your Majesty, I..."</p><p></p><p>But before he could finish, a voice came from the courtyard, </p><p></p><p>"Noisy, noisy, add another half an hour."</p>

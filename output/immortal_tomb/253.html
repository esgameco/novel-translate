        <h1>Chapter 253</h1>
        <div class="content">
            <p>Here is the full English translation of the Chinese excerpt:</p><p></p><p>"Hmm? Stop!"</p><p></p><p>The Old Turtle's brow slightly furrowed as he suddenly waved his hand, signaling Chu Lingxian and the others to stop.</p><p></p><p>Before the puzzled Chu Lingxian and the others could say anything,</p><p></p><p>The Old Turtle turned around and looked into the empty space behind them, puzzledly saying, "Those people have stopped chasing us."</p><p></p><p>Huh?</p><p></p><p>The four exchanged glances.</p><p></p><p>The Old Turtle waved his hand and said helplessly, "Don't ask me, I don't know what they're up to either."</p><p></p><p>Hearing this, although still confused, the four felt somewhat relieved in their hearts.</p><p></p><p>Being hunted down was too unbearable, at least they could take a breather now.</p><p></p><p>Hmm?</p><p></p><p>Just then, the Old Turtle suddenly widened his eyes, his face filled with surprise and disbelief!</p><p></p><p>The Ancient Yin-Yang asked in surprise, "Old Turtle, what's wrong with you?"</p><p></p><p>Ignoring the astonishment of the four, the Old Turtle suddenly disappeared into the void.</p><p></p><p>Chu Lingxian and the others exchanged a glance and hurriedly followed.</p><p></p><p>Could it be that the Old Turtle has discovered some extraordinary beauty?</p><p></p><p>Given his nature, it was very likely.</p><p></p><p>As for anything else, they couldn't think of it for the time being.</p><p></p><p>...</p><p></p><p>"Sir, what are we doing here?"</p><p></p><p>After a long time, Xiao Tong finally couldn't help but hug her arms and asked.</p><p></p><p>Originally, they were supposed to return to Yanyu Town, but the sir suddenly stopped, and it had been a long time.</p><p></p><p>They were now standing in a desolate wilderness, and as far as the eye could see, it was all withered.</p><p></p><p>Lu Changsheng looked into the void, "Waiting for a few people."</p><p></p><p>Waiting for a few people? Xiao Tong was surprised, as she scanned the empty surroundings, it didn't look like there were any people around.</p><p></p><p>But she also quieted down and didn't dare to ask more.</p><p></p><p>It was just that the cold wind blowing in the wilderness made her shiver.</p><p></p><p>Suddenly!</p><p></p><p>A rift opened in the void of the wilderness, and Xiao Tong blankly watched as five figures emerged from it.</p><p></p><p>"Old Turtle, what are we doing in this desolate wilderness?" Shi Wushi scratched his head in puzzlement.</p><p></p><p>But he soon froze.</p><p></p><p>Chu Lingxian and the others were also stunned, staring unbelievably at the blue-robed man standing in the cold wind, whose robes were fluttering.</p><p></p><p>Long... long...</p><p></p><p>"Wuwu, Master, the Old Turtle misses you so much! Why didn't you give the Old Turtle a heads up before coming to the Ancestral Heavenly Realm, so that the Old Turtle could have prepared a banquet to welcome you!" </p><p></p><p>The Old Turtle, with tears streaming down his face, rushed over with open arms, wanting to give him a hug in his excitement.</p><p></p><p>Lu Changsheng's brow slightly furrowed as he kicked the Old Turtle, sending him crashing to the ground.</p><p></p><p>Boom!</p><p></p><p>"Ah!"</p><p></p><p>The Old Turtle's agonized cry made Chu Lingxian and the others' scalps tingle, and they immediately snapped out of their daze. They hurriedly stepped forward and bowed excitedly, "Greetings, Immortal Emperor Changsheng!"</p><p></p><p>Immortal Emperor Changsheng?</p><p></p><p>Beside them, Xiao Tong was shocked, shocked and shocked again, as she tilted her head and looked at the blue-robed man with reverence.</p><p></p><p>Although she didn't understand, she was deeply shaken.</p><p></p><p>She never imagined that in addition to being the doctor of the medical clinic, the sir also had another identity.</p><p></p><p>Lu Changsheng looked at the dirt-covered group with a faint smile and said, "Judging from your state, it seems you haven't been having a very pleasant time these past few days, have you?"</p><p></p><p>Chu Lingxian and the others couldn't help but feel a lump in their throats when they heard this.</p><p></p><p>Yes, they had been through so much hardship.</p><p></p><p>At this time, the Old Turtle, clutching his abdomen, got up from the ground and said unhappily, "Master, you have no idea, those beasts have been so ruthless. Ever since we parted ways on the Divine Path, me and Lingxian have been hunted down day and night."</p><p></p><p>Lu Changsheng glanced at him and said, "If you had spent the time improving your cultivation instead of being lazy, would that not have been better?"</p><p></p><p>"Cough, Master is right, from now on the Old Turtle will definitely not be so playful anymore," the Old Turtle said awkwardly with a slight bow.</p><p></p><p>Indeed, all this time, he had never really focused on cultivating, always thinking that with his long lifespan, he could do it another day.</p><p></p><p>So, another day became another day.</p><p></p><p>Here is the full English translation of the Chinese excerpt:</p><p></p><p>And so the cycle continued.</p><p></p><p>If he had cultivated properly in the past, he would not have been chased to this point today.</p><p></p><p>Looking at the terrified old turtle, Chu Lingian and the others couldn't help but chuckle.</p><p></p><p>Indeed, it must be the Immortal Emperor Changsheng.</p><p></p><p>After all, even those stronger than the old turtle, the old turtle would just ignore them, and no one could defeat him.</p><p></p><p>Luchang Sheng didn't want to say more in this remote wilderness, and immediately said, "You all come back to the medical clinic with me."</p><p></p><p>Medical clinic? </p><p></p><p>Chu Lingian and the others were stunned, but the old turtle didn't seem surprised, as if he was used to it.</p><p></p><p>...</p><p></p><p>Outside Changsheng Medical Clinic in Yanwu Town.</p><p></p><p>Chu Lingian and the others looked at the banner and the signboard, feeling emotional.</p><p></p><p>Wow, Immortal Emperor Changsheng is still the same old Immortal Emperor Changsheng, carefree and elegant throughout his life.</p><p></p><p>While they were being chased so miserably, Immortal Emperor Changsheng was enjoying a peaceful life.</p><p></p><p>Ah, they couldn't compare.</p><p></p><p>At this time, Tongxin happily came out to greet them, "Master, you're back!"</p><p></p><p>He quickly looked at the group in front of him.</p><p></p><p>Unfamiliar, unfamiliar, unfamiliar, still unfamiliar...</p><p></p><p>Until he saw the surprised old turtle.</p><p></p><p>"Senior Turtle! Senior Turtle!" </p><p></p><p>Tongxin exclaimed happily.</p><p></p><p>The old turtle quickly went up to him and jealously patted Tongxin's head, grumbling, "You lucky guy, you actually got to follow the master to the Ancestral Heavenly Realm! Where's that Helin fellow? And Lin Dongle?"</p><p></p><p>Tongxin gave a silly smile, about to say something.</p><p></p><p>Luchang Sheng: "What are you all standing outside for, come in and we'll talk."</p><p></p><p>"Ah, yes, yes, yes."</p><p></p><p>A moment later, inside the medical clinic.</p><p></p><p>Luchang Sheng, the old turtle, Tongxin, Chu Lingian and the others sat around a long table.</p><p></p><p>Xiaotong was studying medical books at the counter.</p><p></p><p>Just as Chu Lingian and the others were puzzledly looking at the crutch leaning against the side,</p><p></p><p>"Senior Turtle, the master and Big Sword Brother are still in the Four Realms, and as for Brother Lin Dongle, he's in a world called Linglang Heaven."</p><p></p><p>Tongxin scratched his head and explained.</p><p></p><p>He couldn't help glancing at the four strangers, Chu Lingian and the others, not out of fear, but because they were all unfamiliar, and it felt a bit strange to be sitting together like this.</p><p></p><p>Sensing this, Chu Lingian and the others shifted their gaze from the crutch and nodded kindly at Tongxin.</p><p></p><p>"Big Sword? Chen Dashou has also cultivated immortality?" The old turtle recalled and was surprised.</p><p></p><p>"Yes, thanks to the master's grace, hehe." Tongxin said cautiously, glancing at the quiet Luchang Sheng sipping tea at the head of the table.</p><p></p><p>The old turtle was about to ask something else, but seeing Tongxin's slightly constrained look towards Chu Lingian and the others, he smiled and explained:</p><p></p><p>"Tongxin, these four are also from the Four Realms, we're all old friends, no need to be so reserved."</p><p></p><p>Also from the Four Realms? Tongxin was a little surprised, but he did feel much more at ease. The old turtle's next sentence, however, shook him.</p><p></p><p>"They, you see, are the five great Immortal Emperors, apart from the master, the other four Immortal Emperors."</p><p></p><p>Tongxin quickly stood up and gave a salute: "Tongxin pays respects to the four Immortal Emperors."</p><p></p><p>After all, when he first entered the Four Realms, the master had instilled in them the idea of how powerful and formidable the Immortal Emperors were, and these four were Immortal Emperors on par with the master.</p><p></p><p>The proper etiquette couldn't be omitted.</p><p></p><p>Chu Lingian and the others smiled and quickly pulled Tongxin back into his seat.</p><p></p><p>Chu Lingian shook his head and sighed, "Junior Daoist Tongxin, we are no longer Immortal Emperors in office in the Four Realms, you don't have to be so formal."</p><p></p><p>Tongxin chuckled awkwardly, didn't say anything, but still maintained the reverence a junior should have. </p><p></p><p>After all, these Immortal Emperors were far more powerful than him.</p>

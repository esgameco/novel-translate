        <h1>Chapter 397</h1>
        <div class="content">
            <p>Here is the full English translation of the excerpt from the Chinese novel:</p><p></p><p>When the various tribes heard the Heavenly God's question, they all trembled in their hearts.</p><p></p><p>One by one, they lowered their heads even further, afraid of making eye contact with the Heavenly God.</p><p></p><p>Everyone knows that the tribe with the greatest enmity towards the Celestial God Tribe must be the Human Tribe.</p><p></p><p>After all, a divine official has perished, and the divine son is still "visiting" the Human Tribe.</p><p></p><p>The Heavenly God's eyes narrowed, and a ruthless killing intent emerged in his heart. The Human Tribe has repeatedly gone against his Celestial God Tribe, and now they have even made him lose face!</p><p></p><p>Hmph... the Human Tribe, he will annihilate them!</p><p></p><p>Afterwards, the Heavenly God swept his gaze across the top ten tribes, and then instructed in an expressionless manner, "Divine Moon, let all the tribes rise and begin the grand divine ritual."</p><p></p><p>"Yes." Divine Moon immediately obeyed the order, then stood up and shouted, "The Heavenly God Lord has commanded, prepare to begin the grand divine ritual, all rise!"</p><p></p><p>The various tribes then stood up, but they all kept their heads lowered, not daring to look at the Heavenly God.</p><p></p><p>They were angry but dared not speak out, and they had to hold the grand divine ritual, not even having a place to sit, let alone food and drink.</p><p></p><p>Fortunately, they also didn't bring any gifts, so they didn't lose much.</p><p></p><p>Divine Moon cleared his throat and announced loudly, "The grand divine ritual is officially..."</p><p></p><p>"Wait." The Heavenly God suddenly raised his hand.</p><p></p><p>"Eh? Yes..." Divine Moon was a bit confused.</p><p></p><p>The various tribes were also puzzled, not knowing what was happening.</p><p></p><p>At this moment, a disturbance appeared outside, and soon a member of the Celestial God Tribe reported with a slight sneer, "The Human Tribe, they have arrived!"</p><p></p><p>The Human Tribe has arrived?!</p><p></p><p>Immediately, the various tribes became a bit restless, and many of them showed expressions of gloating.</p><p></p><p>After the previous incident, the Human Tribe has enmity with the vast majority of the other tribes.</p><p></p><p>Subsequently, the members of the various tribes parted to the sides, making way for the Human Tribe to enter the Celestial God Square, further crowding the already cramped space.</p><p></p><p>Soon, Jian Wuhui and others brought the bound Shen Luo and other figures of the major tribes into the Celestial God Square, standing beside the peak tribes.</p><p></p><p>"Whew, that's definitely the divine son Shen Luo, as well as the holy scions and high-level figures of other major tribes!"</p><p></p><p>"What is the Human Tribe thinking, being so arrogant, they actually dared to bring the divine son here bound..."</p><p></p><p>"Tch, you don't understand. If the Human Tribe had released the divine son, that would be true foolishness."</p><p></p><p>"That's right, with the Heavenly God's own son in their hands, the Human Tribe can negotiate with the Heavenly God."</p><p></p><p>"By the way, who is that azure-robed sword immortal who slays the strong?"</p><p></p><p>"Ah yes, the leader is the Sword Sovereign Extinguishing the Heavens and five others, as well as a lecherous old man, but I don't see the legendary one."</p><p></p><p>"Haha, in my opinion, that azure-robed sword immortal is probably a coward, hiding among the Human Tribe."</p><p></p><p>"......"</p><p></p><p>The various tribes whispered and discussed among themselves, expressing disdain, pity, and mockery.</p><p></p><p>At this moment, the focus was all on the Human Tribe!</p><p></p><p>The peak tribes of the top ten also saw their own holy scions and high-level figures bound, furrowing their brows, but this was not the time to demand an explanation from the Human Tribe.</p><p></p><p>"Father! I want the Human Tribe to die!"</p><p></p><p>At this time, the long-suppressed Shen Luo finally couldn't hold back and shouted.</p><p></p><p>The entire venue was stunned, and many gazes were discreetly cast towards the Heavenly God, only to find him unusually calm, even with a slight smile on his face.</p><p></p><p>The Heavenly God didn't even look at Shen Luo and instructed, "Divine Moon, continue to organize the grand divine ritual."</p><p></p><p>Shen Luo paused, looking at his father with a sense of unfamiliarity. What's going on, am I not your own son anymore?</p><p></p><p>Shouldn't he immediately rescue him and ask with concern, "Luo'er, how are you feeling?"</p><p></p><p>At this moment, the various tribes and...</p><p></p><p>Here is my translation of the Chinese excerpt:</p><p></p><p>Shen Luo was generally puzzled, as no one could fathom Shen Ting's thoughts.</p><p></p><p>The human cultivators also had grave expressions. The more Shen Ting acted this way, the more they were wary of him. Could it be that it was because Shen Luo was in their hands, so Shen Ting was temporarily constrained?</p><p></p><p>"Sword Sovereign, what exactly does this Shen Ting mean..." Han Jinlong frowned as he transmitted. His palms were already damp with cold sweat, as only when facing the Celestial Lord could one experience such terrifying pressure.</p><p></p><p>Jian Wuhui shook his head: "Let's just observe and keep a close eye on Shen Luo."</p><p></p><p>"Mm."</p><p></p><p>...</p><p></p><p>Shen Yue was stunned for a moment, then quickly bowed: "Yes."</p><p></p><p>Afterwards, Shen Yue shouted: "The grand ceremony begins!"</p><p></p><p>As soon as Shen Yue spoke, waves of celestial music came from all directions, and a colorful mist appeared in the sky, with flying cranes circling above.</p><p></p><p>The ground where the cultivators of all tribes stood was covered in an illusory red carpet.</p><p></p><p>Seeing this, the cultivators of all tribes were taken aback. Just a moment ago, they were filled with a sense of solemnity and awkwardness, but now they suddenly felt the atmosphere of a ceremony.</p><p></p><p>What did the Celestial Lord mean by this?</p><p></p><p>While the cultivators were pondering, Shen Ting on the high platform folded his white feathered wings and began to step forward.</p><p></p><p>As soon as Shen Ting took a step, an illusory staircase appeared under his feet, and he slowly ascended to the high point.</p><p></p><p>And below him were the countless cultivators of all tribes, like countless stars.</p><p></p><p>Shen Ting flicked his sleeve, looking down at the cultivators with an arrogant smile on his face, and said:</p><p></p><p>"I, the Celestial Lord, was born into the great Celestial Tribe. Since birth, I have been at the top, the strongest among my peers!"</p><p></p><p>As he said this, Shen Ting turned his head to look at Bi You and Ao Zhengtian on the stone pillars.</p><p></p><p>To be honest, among the top ten peak great clans, only Bi You and Ao Zhengtian could be barely considered in his eyes.</p><p></p><p>In the past, perhaps it was difficult to suppress them, but now, he and these two were no longer in the same world.</p><p></p><p>Bi You and Ao Zhengtian's expressions were extremely unsightly...</p><p></p><p>Not only did Shen Ting bind them and display them, but he also publicly humiliated them, truly killing them with his words!</p><p></p><p>But they could only endure it. In addition to being prisoners, the most important thing was that the victor's words were the final say.</p><p></p><p>"Clap clap clap clap clap clap!" </p><p></p><p>Enthusiastic applause suddenly erupted throughout the Celestial Plaza, and some members of the Celestial Tribe even shouted fervently, "The Celestial Lord is invincible!!"</p><p></p><p>Seeing this, the smile on Shen Ting's face grew even thicker, and he closed his eyes slightly, savoring the enthusiastic applause from all the tribes.</p><p></p><p>Yes, this was the feeling!</p><p></p><p>It was much stronger than the previous cheers from just the Celestial Tribe members.</p><p></p><p>After a moment, Shen Ting raised his hand slightly, and the plaza inside and outside fell silent.</p><p></p><p>He continued to smile and said, "Now, I, the Celestial Lord, have also achieved the status of a divine being, the unique and undisputed strongest in the divine-demonic battlefield!"</p><p></p><p>Clap clap clap clap, another round of enthusiastic applause, and Shen Ting's mouth was almost reaching his ears, as he had never been so unrestrained before.</p><p></p><p>Today was the happiest day of his life.</p><p></p><p>"You can rest assured, although I, the Celestial Lord, am the supreme divine being, I will not deliberately suppress the various tribes. Everything will continue to operate as usual, but..."</p><p></p><p>The cultivators of all tribes heard Shen Ting's words and were delighted at first, but then they became anxious when they heard the turn.</p><p></p><p>Shen Ting continued, "But all tribes must hand over their divine bodies that have ranked on the Divine Body Ranking. Don't make me have to personally intervene."</p>

        <h1>Chapter 111</h1>
        <div class="content">
            <p>Here is the full English translation of the Chinese excerpt:</p><p></p><p>The Fuyao Immortal Realm Inspection Palace was destroyed, which immediately alarmed the Immortal Emperor Palace. üèÜ‚ô§‚ûÖ‚ûàÀ¢ùì±·ªÆùìß.ÔΩÉùëú–º‚òØ‚ôó</p><p></p><p>After all, the Inspection Palace was a direct force under the Immortal Emperor Palace, and any slight disturbance could be quickly detected by them. Moreover, this was not just a slight disturbance, but the complete annihilation of the palace, and the one who died was not just some random person, but an Immortal King!</p><p></p><p>It had been a long time since an Immortal King had died. In the Immortal Realm, those above the Immortal King level are generally extremely difficult to kill, apart from natural causes.</p><p></p><p>The Immortal Emperor Palace immediately dispatched many powerful experts to the Fuyao Immortal Realm to investigate.</p><p></p><p>After some time, when they arrived at the Fuyao Immortal Realm, they were shocked to see the crystal palace floating in the sky.</p><p></p><p>When they saw the ice sculptures of Jin Yang and the group of Inspection Commissioners, their expressions became grave.</p><p></p><p>Jin Yang's posture before death was kneeling, and the expression on the face of this mighty Immortal King was one of terror.</p><p></p><p>This inevitably led them to endless speculation.</p><p></p><p>This matter was definitely not simple.</p><p></p><p>Amid their doubts, they decided to temporarily suppress the news and investigate it slowly.</p><p></p><p>However, they did not know that the news had already spread like a plague throughout the Fuyao Immortal Realm, and it was now too late to suppress it.</p><p></p><p>Unless...</p><p></p><p>Unless they destroyed the frozen Inspection Palace and then claimed it was just a rumor.</p><p></p><p>But this idea was quickly rejected by the group.</p><p></p><p>After collecting some clues, they hurriedly left.</p><p></p><p>.........</p><p></p><p>"It's strange, we've been on the run for some time, but the Inspection Palace hasn't sent anyone to pursue us. What's going on? This is not their usual style."</p><p></p><p>"I don't know, we shouldn't let our guard down. Let's take a break and continue our escape."</p><p></p><p>"Now, we have a problem. Our three families have a large number of people, which makes us a big target. This won't work in the long run."</p><p></p><p>"Huang Zhong, Chen He, I have a plan."</p><p></p><p>Chu Lang looked back at the vast number of clansmen stretching as far as the eye could see and said.</p><p></p><p>Huang Zhong and Chen He: "Tell us."</p><p></p><p>"From now on, whenever we arrive in a new region, we'll leave some of the clansmen there temporarily. Later, when we find a safe place, we'll come back to gather them up." Chu Lang said calmly.</p><p></p><p>Huang Zhong and Chen He's eyes flashed, and they eventually nodded.</p><p></p><p>To be honest, this was just a euphemistic way of saying they would abandon some of the clansmen, but there was really no other choice at the moment.</p><p></p><p>The three fell silent.</p><p></p><p>Behind Chu Lang, Chu Xiran and Zhang Youdao were also silent.</p><p></p><p>At this moment, a streak of light flashed across the sky!</p><p></p><p>Chu Lang and the others were startled, like frightened birds, their bodies trembling.</p><p></p><p>They instinctively looked up, their faces full of alertness.</p><p></p><p>They were truly afraid that the Inspection Palace had come to pursue them.</p><p></p><p>Soon, their fists clenched, their nerves tense, as they saw the streak of light descend towards them.</p><p></p><p>The many clansmen of the three Immortal Families also became anxious and restless at the sight.</p><p></p><p>The next moment, a gentle voice sounded,</p><p></p><p>"Fellow Daoists."</p><p></p><p>A scholarly-looking middle-aged man with a black silk blindfold over his eyes appeared before Chu Lang and the others, surrounded by a group of elders. He cupped his hands and greeted them with a smile.</p><p></p><p>Seeing that it was not the Inspection Palace, Chu Lang and the others heaved a sigh of relief, but they still did not let their guard down, cupping their hands in return and asking, "Friend, what brings you here?"</p><p></p><p>The scholarly-looking middle-aged man seemed to sweep his gaze over the large group, and smiled meaningfully, "If you are migrating to escape the Inspection Palace, there is no need for that."</p><p></p><p>Chu Lang and the others were shocked, involuntarily taking a step back and staring at the scholarly-looking middle-aged man in disbelief.</p><p></p><p>They did not know how this man knew so much about their situation, and they had never seen him before.</p><p></p><p>Moreover, this place was already some distance from the Langtiandomain, and their three Immortal Families might have some reputation in the Langtiandomain, but outside of it, they were just an obscure clan. It was impossible for someone to recognize them!</p><p></p><p>Here is the full English translation of the Chinese excerpt:</p><p></p><p>This is too strange!</p><p></p><p>New 99 Books ‚Üí 99shux.com</p><p></p><p>"Fellow Daoist, you..."</p><p></p><p>Chu Lang was somewhat surprised and hesitant, wanting to say more but holding back.</p><p></p><p>The refined middle-aged man raised his hand to soothe them, saying, "You three Fellow Daoists don't need to be afraid, the Pavilion Master here has no ill intentions. I just came to kindly remind you that the Patrol Grand Hall has been destroyed, so you should just return from where you came."</p><p></p><p>After saying this, he prepared to leave with a group of elders.</p><p></p><p>The three of Chu Lang were stunned, then their pupils shrank!</p><p></p><p>The Patrol Grand Hall has been destroyed?!</p><p></p><p>It was Chu Xiruo and Zhang Youdao who suddenly exchanged a glance, as if they had understood something in that instant.</p><p></p><p>"Senior, please wait."</p><p></p><p>Chu Lang couldn't help but call out.</p><p></p><p>The refined middle-aged man turned back with a slight surprise, his eyes under the black silk veil seeming to look at him.</p><p></p><p>"Senior, I don't know who destroyed the Patrol Grand Hall?" Chu Lang asked with difficulty. Somehow, the words of the man in green robes from before kept flashing in his mind, "You don't need to worry about the Patrol Hall coming to seek revenge, because before that, I will deal with them."</p><p></p><p>Could it really be that the senior in green robes did this?</p><p></p><p>But... even if it was destroyed, why was it the Grand Hall, not just a branch hall? Wasn't the Grand Hall's Pavilion Master a Xian King?</p><p></p><p>And the senior in green robes was just a Xian Lord of Chaos, how could he have done this?</p><p></p><p>Hearing this, the refined middle-aged man fell silent, and after a moment, he said, "The Pavilion Master cannot tell you who destroyed the Patrol Grand Hall, because our sect cannot calculate it, and also dare not calculate it."</p><p></p><p>At these words, the group of elders behind him all lowered their heads and fell silent.</p><p></p><p>Huh, calculate?</p><p></p><p>The three of Chu Lang were dumbfounded, wow, so you can actually calculate this!</p><p></p><p>Do you have to play with them like this?</p><p></p><p>After all, how could a force like the Patrol Grand Hall be destroyed.</p><p></p><p>Indifferent to the strangeness of the three, the refined middle-aged man smiled and cupped his hands, "You three, farewell."</p><p></p><p>"May I ask for your honorable name, Senior?" </p><p></p><p>Just then, Chen He suddenly looked solemnly at the back of the refined middle-aged man, his eyes flickering.</p><p></p><p>"This Pavilion Master is Nangong Jing."</p><p></p><p>The refined middle-aged man said, then disappeared with the group of elders.</p><p></p><p>Chen He's heart trembled, his face turned pale, and his body started to shiver.</p><p></p><p>Chu Lang and Huang Zhong were also startled, feeling flustered and almost kneeling down!</p><p></p><p>Perhaps they were just three small immortal clans on the edge, but the renowned name of the Imperial Martial Immortal Realm's Heavenly Calculation Pavilion still resounded in their ears!</p><p></p><p>The one who had just stood before them was actually the famous Heavenly Calculation Pavilion's Pavilion Master, Nangong Jing??</p><p></p><p>For the Heavenly Calculation Pavilion's Pavilion Master to suddenly come to their Fushao Immortal Realm, what was the purpose?</p><p></p><p>Looking at it this way, the Patrol Grand Hall had indeed been destroyed without a doubt.</p><p></p><p>As everyone knows, the Heavenly Calculation Pavilion of the Imperial Martial Immortal Realm can calculate everything, past, present and future, claiming to be able to calculate all things in the world.</p><p></p><p>Not only in the Southern Immortal Realm, but even in the entire Four Directions Immortal Realm, their status is somewhat transcendent.</p><p></p><p>It is said that even the Immortal Emperors have consulted the Heavenly Calculation Pavilion...</p><p></p><p>Unexpectedly, the Heavenly Calculation Pavilion's Pavilion Master himself turned out to be so amiable.</p><p></p><p>"Did you just hear the Heavenly Calculation Pavilion's Pavilion Master say that he dares not calculate the one who destroyed the Patrol Hall?" Huang Zhong suddenly asked in a solemn voice.</p><p></p><p>Chu Lang and Chen He recalled this, their bodies going numb. The one the Heavenly Calculation Pavilion's Pavilion Master dares not calculate?</p><p></p><p>They didn't dare to think about it anymore, this was beyond their imagination.</p><p></p><p>At this time, Chu Xiruo's eyes flashed, and she stepped forward, "Father, Elders, since the Patrol Hall has been destroyed, let's go back to the Langtiandomain."</p><p></p><p>Chu Lang's group was stunned, as if remembering something, then they simultaneously turned their heads, staring straight at Chu Xiruo.</p><p></p><p>They clearly remembered that Chu Xiruo had said at the time that the senior in green robes would take care of it, and she had sworn it.</p><p></p><p>Chu Xiruo: "..."</p>

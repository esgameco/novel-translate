        <h1>Chapter 493</h1>
        <div class="content">
            <p>Here is the full English translation of the excerpt from the Chinese novel:</p><p></p><p>The entire Dengtiandao Island was in an uproar!</p><p></p><p>Many cultivators who were in the midst of comprehending the laws were suddenly interrupted!</p><p></p><p>As they closed their eyes to continue their comprehension, they suddenly realized that the laws had become powerless. When they opened their eyes, they were shocked to find that there was not a trace of the laws' power around them!</p><p></p><p>What's going on?</p><p></p><p>As they broke through the barriers, they witnessed the astonishing changes in the heavens and earth - it seemed that the entire Dengtiandao Island was roaring.</p><p></p><p>In another place, two elves were also dumbfounded.</p><p></p><p>"Lin, what is happening? As far as I can remember, Dengtiandao Island has never experienced such strange events before. It seems that all the laws are converging towards the central region!"</p><p></p><p>"I don't know either."</p><p></p><p>"The central region is occupied by the nine major powers. Could it be that they are up to something?"</p><p></p><p>"No, that's unlikely. The commotion of the laws cannot be man-made. It seems that there is something in the central region that is attracting the laws."</p><p></p><p>"Lin, shall we go take a look?"</p><p></p><p>"Forget it. I've heard from our clan members that the central domain of Dengtiandao Island is protected by a barrier, and we couldn't enter it before."</p><p></p><p>"Alright."</p><p></p><p>...</p><p></p><p>Although the commotion on Dengtiandao Island was immense, the cultivators could only watch helplessly. They dared not venture into the central domain.</p><p></p><p>That place was a forbidden land for them. If they dared to go there, not only would they meet their demise, but they would also implicate their own factions.</p><p></p><p>At the same time, in the central domain, the top powers were all stunned!</p><p></p><p>The laws in the central domain had always been extremely dense, but now, countless laws were surging in from all directions on the island.</p><p></p><p>They could see that the laws were converging towards the core region, the Wanzhang Snow Mountain.</p><p></p><p>Previously, a person and a turtle had entered, and the nine high-level experts had chased after them. Now, with such a commotion, what could have happened there?</p><p></p><p>...</p><p></p><p>At the peak of the Wanzhang Snow Mountain, the high-level experts of the nine top powers sensed the laws in the core domain, and their hearts were filled with trepidation.</p><p></p><p>It was too dense, too dense!</p><p></p><p>And there was a continuous influx of laws from all directions, frantically filling this space.</p><p></p><p>They could even feel the exhilaration of the laws, yes, the exhilaration.</p><p></p><p>The nine high-level experts looked at Lu Changsheng with fearful eyes. Just who was this person?</p><p></p><p>He had actually gathered all the laws of the entire Dengtiandao Island to the core domain!</p><p></p><p>This level of affinity and appeal was absolutely not something that the Divine Void Eight Transformations could possess.</p><p></p><p>They even speculated that even Enlightened Beings might not be able to achieve this.</p><p></p><p>After a moment, Lu Changsheng saw that the laws had all gathered here, so he no longer cared and came down to sit aside, leaving the rest to the old turtle.</p><p></p><p>At this time, the old turtle, who was seated in meditation, had his brows deeply furrowed!</p><p></p><p>The old turtle was immersed in his own world, completely unaware of what was happening outside.</p><p></p><p>The old turtle only knew that the laws in this space had reached an unprecedented density!</p><p></p><p>Soon, the old turtle felt as if he had entered a deep, dark space, and countless beams of light were flashing by like shooting stars, endless and unceasing!</p><p></p><p>These were all laws!</p><p></p><p>Among them, many laws lingered and cautiously approached the old turtle.</p><p></p><p>Common laws, high-level laws...</p><p></p><p>The old turtle frowned and sighed, "I'm sorry, I did not come for you... I want to become stronger, to be able to help my master. You cannot help me, only the sovereigns among you can!"</p><p></p><p>The laws understood the old turtle's intention and dispersed around him.</p><p></p><p>The old turtle tightly knitted his brows, carefully sensing the unique aura in the profound space!</p><p></p><p>The old turtle could feel that there were supreme laws in the space, but they were...</p><p></p><p>Here is the full English translation of the Chinese excerpt:</p><p></p><p>Why are those top-tier laws unwilling to reveal themselves?</p><p></p><p>Could it be that this old turtle is too trash, and these top-tier laws look down on him?</p><p></p><p>Impossible, he is the immortal heavenly turtle!</p><p></p><p>The master has said that this turtle species is rare in the world, and may even be unique!</p><p></p><p>"I know you are watching me in the dark! To be honest, I have come for you. Can you come out and meet me?"</p><p></p><p>The old turtle's voice echoed in this seemingly illusory and wondrous space.</p><p></p><p>But there was no response.</p><p></p><p>The ordinary laws and higher laws were still circling.</p><p></p><p>In fact, many of these higher laws are extremely precious!</p><p></p><p>In the sea of laws, the insights of the top powerhouses are just the leading higher laws!</p><p></p><p>In fact, the top-tier laws, the entire three thousand realms of laws, currently have no one who has mastered them!</p><p></p><p>Even the chairman of the Sea Merchant Association, a master of profound mysteries, his profundities are only derived from the higher laws.</p><p></p><p>After a long while, the space still remained silent, and the old turtle's heart became a little unstable.</p><p></p><p>Because Luchang Sheng had ordered him to master three top-tier laws, but now not even one had appeared!</p><p></p><p>Could it be that this old turtle is really going to be in eternal slumber on the Ascension Island?</p><p></p><p>The old turtle was breached, bitterly saying, "Top-tier law brothers, just give the old turtle a little face and come out. Don't worry, as long as you follow the old turtle, in the future you will be able to shine brightly!"</p><p></p><p>"I don't want much, just three top-tier laws will do."</p><p></p><p>As the old turtle's words fell, the many laws in the space paused, obviously startled.</p><p></p><p>As everyone knows, ordinary people can only master one law, does this person not know that? He is actually so greedy!</p><p></p><p>The space remained silent, as if the so-called top-tier laws did not exist at all.</p><p></p><p>Seeing this, the old turtle's anger rose, and he suddenly shouted angrily:</p><p></p><p>"You're really giving me face! I am the immortal heavenly turtle!! I am the exclusive mount of that young man in blue. Although I am increasingly puzzled about the origins of my master, my master must be extraordinary! You are really blind!!"</p><p></p><p>Suddenly!</p><p></p><p>The space began to tremble!</p><p></p><p>Several special essences became increasingly clear in the old turtle's perception!!</p><p></p><p>The old turtle's eyes immediately lit up with joy. Could it be that these top-tier laws are just a bunch of cowards, and they need to be scolded a bit before they come out?</p><p></p><p>But the next moment, an ancient voice sounded in the space:</p><p></p><p>"Since you are the mount of the Dao Venerable, we are willing to follow you."</p><p></p><p>The old turtle's pupils suddenly contracted!</p><p></p><p>Dao, Dao Venerable!!</p><p></p><p>...</p><p></p><p>At the peak of the snow mountain.</p><p></p><p>Nine high-level figures were confined in the air, unable to move, their hair and bodies already covered in frost.</p><p></p><p>Because the power of the laws within them had all been confined.</p><p></p><p>The nine high-level figures looked at the young man in blue with trembling eyes, their fear already at its peak!</p><p></p><p>At first, when this person confined them, they only felt a sense of terror, but the anomaly of the laws on the Ascension Island at this moment made them experience sheer terror!</p><p></p><p>Luchang Sheng picked up some snow from the ground, rolled it into a snowball in his hand, and then casually threw it over.</p><p></p><p>The snowball accurately hit the face of the Chu Clan Elder, bursting open.</p><p></p><p>The Chu Clan Elder immediately had a swollen and bruised face, and he looked pitifully at Luchang Sheng, inwardly wanting to ask, "Big shot, why did you only throw at me and not at them?"</p><p></p><p>The other eight high-level figures were scared and swallowed their saliva.</p><p></p><p>Luchang Sheng looked up at the Chu Clan Elder and smiled, saying, "How is Chu Yao doing recently?"</p>

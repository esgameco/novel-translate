        <h1>Chapter 136</h1>
        <div class="content">
            <p>Here is the full English translation of the Chinese excerpt:</p><p></p><p>Lu Changsheng glanced sideways at the four dejected snowmen and said softly, "We won't harm you, nor will we harm the Snowball Tribe, so don't worry."</p><p></p><p>Hearing this, the four snowmen felt a little relieved in their hearts, but their eyes were still full of defiance.</p><p></p><p>As if saying: You still want to harm our Snowball Tribe? Anyone can boast, just look at how capable you are!</p><p></p><p>"Hey, you little brats still don't seem to be convinced?!"</p><p></p><p>The old turtle immediately raised his hand as if to strike!</p><p></p><p>The four snowmen were frightened and their bodies shrank back!</p><p></p><p>"Alright, old turtle, let them lead the way," Lu Changsheng ordered.</p><p></p><p>"Hehe, yes." The old turtle responded, picking up a dark green rope, shaking it, and growling, "Hurry up and lead the way! Or else grandpa turtle will eat you all up!"</p><p></p><p>The four snowmen, seeing this, were a little afraid and quickly went to the front to lead the way.</p><p></p><p>Lu Changsheng and the others followed slowly.</p><p></p><p>Chu Lingian and the others couldn't help but smile. This old turtle was still a child at heart, he liked to play. They all knew the old turtle had no ill intentions.</p><p></p><p>...</p><p></p><p>In the Ancestral Heavenly Divine Realm.</p><p>The Dao One Holy Land, the Guest House.</p><p></p><p>Bang!</p><p></p><p>A young man dressed in a luxurious golden robe slammed his fist heavily on the expensive table in front of him, and with a crack, the table was shattered into pieces!</p><p></p><p>The people in front of him trembled and quickly knelt down, burying their heads to the ground.</p><p></p><p>"Useless! A bunch of useless people! I just came to the Dao One Holy Land to discuss something with the Divine Kings, and in just a few days, you come to tell me that my palace is gone??"</p><p></p><p>Ye Wutian's angular face was full of anger.</p><p></p><p>If this news spread throughout the Heavenly Saint Divine Realm, he, Ye Wutian, would become a laughingstock!</p><p></p><p>Throughout history, no one had ever heard of a Divine King going out and then having their palace disappear.</p><p></p><p>This was truly unprecedented!</p><p></p><p>"The news should have been sealed, right?"</p><p></p><p>Ye Wutian took a deep breath and frowned as he asked.</p><p></p><p>"No... no, it hasn't."</p><p></p><p>"Outrageous!!"</p><p></p><p>The veins on Ye Wutian's neck pulsed as he growled.</p><p></p><p>"Divine King, please calm down! It's really that the speed of that punch was too fast, when it came at us, all the people in the Divine King's Palace couldn't even react in time, and the commotion it caused was too great, so many people came rushing over at the time..."</p><p></p><p>"Divine King, please calm down..."</p><p></p><p>The people were terrified.</p><p></p><p>Ye Wutian closed his eyes, and a faint golden light seeped out from the corners of his eyes as he said in a deep voice,</p><p></p><p>"So you mean to say that my Divine King's Palace has been destroyed, and now everyone knows about it?"</p><p></p><p>The people nodded blankly, even if not everyone knew, it was close to that.</p><p></p><p>"Who was it? From which direction did that powerful punch come from?"</p><p></p><p>Ye Wutian said in a low voice, the words seeming to be squeezed out between his teeth.</p><p></p><p>"Divine King, we investigated the direction that punch came from... that punch seemed to have... seemed to have come from outside the Ancestral Heavenly Divine Realm..."</p><p></p><p>Someone said in a low voice, and towards the end, they looked at Ye Wutian with some trepidation.</p><p></p><p>Sure enough, Ye Wutian's face turned deathly pale!</p><p></p><p>He shouted angrily, "You're saying that the punch that destroyed my Divine King's Palace came from the lower realm?? Nonsense!!"</p><p></p><p>The strongest experts in the lower realm were at most at the Immortal Emperor level, the Immortal Emperor level could produce that kind of punch? And a punch that crossed countless distances?</p><p></p><p>And also destroyed his Divine King's Palace? Absurd!</p><p></p><p>After all, his Divine King's Palace was built with the best materials exclusive to the Ancestral Heavenly Divine Realm, it couldn't be destroyed by someone from the lower realm!</p><p></p><p>So, the truth could only be one thing - </p><p></p><p>"You're lying," Ye Wutian said indifferently, and continued, "Are you afraid that I will blame you, or is the enemy too powerful? So you collectively fabricated a groundless excuse to cover this up?"</p><p></p><p>Here is the full English translation of the Chinese excerpt:</p><p></p><p>The heads of the crowd were shaking like a rattle drum!</p><p></p><p>"Your Majesty the Divine King, what we have said is all true. I am willing to take the Heavenly Oath. If I have spoken falsely, may the Nine Heavenly Thunderbolts strike me down!!"</p><p></p><p>Hearing this, Ye Wutian's eyes narrowed as he suddenly looked out towards the horizon!</p><p></p><p>Hmm? A clear sky?</p><p></p><p>His brow slowly furrowed, it seems that what his subordinates said was true...</p><p></p><p>Because in the Ancestral Heavenly Realm, if one violates the Heavenly Oath, they will be struck down by the Nine Heavenly Thunderbolts.</p><p></p><p>"Since it's the Lower Realm, then which Lower Realm is it?"</p><p></p><p>Thereupon, Ye Wutian asked indifferently.</p><p></p><p>"The...Four Directions Immortal Realm..."</p><p></p><p>"The Four Directions Immortal Realm?" Ye Wutian was slightly taken aback.</p><p></p><p>Speaking of the Four Directions Immortal Realm, he didn't know if the Abyssal Demon Tribe had already destroyed the five major immortal realms within it or not...</p><p></p><p>After a long while, Ye Wutian finally said,</p><p></p><p>"The King still has some matters to attend to at the Dao Saint Land. After you return, there are two things to be done: first, construct the Divine King's Hall in the shortest time possible; second, send people to the Divine Path to inquire about the situation of the five major immortal realms in the Four Directions Immortal Realm."</p><p></p><p>"Yes."</p><p></p><p>...</p><p></p><p>The four snowmen were walking silently in front.</p><p></p><p>Old Turtle saw this and his eyes flashed, he transmitted a message to Lu Changsheng: "Master, these four little things seem to be up to some tricks."</p><p></p><p>Lu Changsheng smiled.</p><p></p><p>Seeing this, Old Turtle surveyed the surrounding environment, then mockingly said, "You little things better not try any tricks, or else you'll get a beating."</p><p></p><p>The four snowmen trembled inwardly, their eyes glancing at each other, reaching a consensus.</p><p></p><p>One snowman turned his head and fearfully said, "You are so powerful, we don't dare to try any tricks..."</p><p></p><p>Old Turtle inwardly chuckled, waving his hand and urging, "Hurry up and lead the way, move quickly."</p><p></p><p>"Shall we take them to the restriction set up by Uncle Shu of our Snow Tower Tribe?"</p><p></p><p>"That's fine, that's fine. At that time, they will be suppressed and unable to move. Wouldn't we then be able to do whatever we want?"</p><p></p><p>"Hehe, let's do it that way, let's go!"</p><p></p><p>"..."</p><p></p><p>The four snowmen were transmitting messages to each other while leading the way, and their footsteps had become a bit lighter, as if they were looking forward to something.</p><p></p><p>Little did they know that Lu Changsheng had heard their transmitted conversation clearly.</p><p></p><p>Soon after,</p><p></p><p>The four snowmen led Lu Changsheng and the others to a cliff edge.</p><p></p><p>There was a swaying wooden plank bridge connecting the opposite cliff.</p><p></p><p>The strong wind was howling, and the wooden bridge was swaying constantly.</p><p></p><p>Chu Lingian and the others' eyes flashed, they could see at a glance that there was a restriction on the opposite cliff.</p><p></p><p>However, they remained calm on the surface. Since they could see it, naturally Lu Changsheng could also see it.</p><p></p><p>"As long as you cross this wooden bridge, you'll soon arrive at our Snow Ball Tribe!" </p><p></p><p>One of the snowmen turned around and smiled brightly.</p><p></p><p>Old Turtle was about to speak, but Lu Changsheng smiled gently, "Okay, we believe you."</p><p></p><p>Uh...</p><p></p><p>The four snowmen's souls trembled, they didn't know why, but they always felt that this young man's smile was a bit cold.</p><p></p><p>They didn't dare to say more, and took the lead in stepping onto the wooden bridge, heading towards the opposite cliff.</p><p></p><p>Lu Changsheng stepped forward and followed, Chu Lingian and the others also followed behind Lu Changsheng, not too wary.</p><p></p><p>Not to mention Lu Changsheng, they were at least Immortal Emperor-level experts in the Four Directions Immortal Realm. How could they be schemed against by a few little things? Even if they were schemed against, it would be useless in the face of absolute strength.</p><p></p><p>Soon,</p><p></p><p>The four snowmen reached the opposite cliff, they took a few steps back, waiting expectantly at the edge of the cliff, looking at Lu Changsheng and the others on the wooden bridge.</p><p></p><p>"Hurry up and come over..."</p>

        <h1>Chapter 142</h1>
        <div class="content">
            <p>Here is the full English translation of the Chinese excerpt:</p><p></p><p>Time flies by, indifferently and swiftly. 6̷9̷s̷h̷u̷x̷.̷c̷o̷m̷</p><p></p><p>It has now been two thousand years since Luchang Sheng emerged from the immortal tomb in the Lingchen Realm.</p><p></p><p>The old turtle and the others went to the Ancestral Heavenly Realm almost fourteen hundred years ago.</p><p></p><p>In the span of fourteen hundred years, the five major immortal realms, except for the Central Immortal Realm, have all seen the enthronement of new immortal emperors.</p><p></p><p>Since the four immortal emperors Chu Lingian left for the Ancestral Heavenly Realm, except for the already predetermined Southern Immortal Realm, the vacant immortal emperor positions in the other three major immortal realms have sparked fierce competition.</p><p></p><p>The contenders were primarily the immortal lords of each immortal realm, and the imperial positions were finally settled after hundreds of years of struggle.</p><p></p><p>In the end, everyone's gaze turned towards the Central Immortal Realm, filled with puzzlement.</p><p></p><p>Among the five major immortal realms, only the Central Immortal Realm has remained peaceful and quiet all along.</p><p></p><p>Later, it was said that the imperial decree in the immortal emperor's palace of the Central Immortal Realm still hung there, with the two characters "Changsheng" engraved on it.</p><p></p><p>They then realized that the one in the Central Immortal Realm, for some unknown reason, had not yet ascended.</p><p></p><p>However, in the past fourteen hundred years, his presence has never been seen.</p><p></p><p>Only the legends associated with him have been widely circulating in the vast five major immortal realms.</p><p></p><p>Fourteen hundred years, for the cultivators of the five major immortal realms, is not long, but not too short either.</p><p></p><p>During this period, enough time has passed for certain things to undergo changes.</p><p></p><p>The Southern Immortal Realm, the Fuyao Immortal Continent, the Langtian Domain.</p><p></p><p>The ascension portal in the vast desert.</p><p></p><p>At this moment, there are three figures sitting in meditation outside.</p><p></p><p>"Haha, I never thought the day would come when our White Moon Sect would be promoted to a one-star sect. Our White Moon Sect has finally gained some weight and is no longer an obscure and nameless sect!"</p><p></p><p>Wu Che scanned the desert, chuckling with a sense of accomplishment.</p><p></p><p>"Tch, even though we've been promoted to a higher-ranked sect, we're still being suppressed by the three immortal clans of the Chu, Huang, and Chen families in this Langtian Domain, aren't we?"</p><p></p><p>Hai Dong sneered.</p><p></p><p>Wu Che rolled his eyes and didn't say anything. He suddenly looked towards the side at Gu Helin and asked curiously,</p><p></p><p>"Brother Gu, why have you been taking the initiative to come and guide the people from the lower realms during this period? Your natural talent and temperament are so good, the sect master has high hopes for you. Wouldn't it be better for you to stay in the sect and cultivate peacefully?"</p><p></p><p>Hai Dong also became curious when he heard this and looked at Gu Helin, wondering what kind of secret the latter was hiding. It's not like they've been close friends for a long time, so why would Gu Helin volunteer for this task?</p><p></p><p>Gu Helin was about to open his mouth to speak when suddenly...</p><p></p><p>Rumble...</p><p></p><p>The ascension portal opened, and three figures emerged from it.</p><p></p><p>One was a young man in white clothes, with a constant smile on his face and his eyes darting around, filled with anticipation and excitement.</p><p></p><p>The second was a resolute-looking young man, who looked at the young man in white with a resigned expression.</p><p></p><p>The third was a middle-aged man with a square face, his eyes filled with a sense of weariness.</p><p></p><p>"The immortal realm is really nice! The spiritual energy here is so abundant, the master must have advanced his cultivation by leaps and bounds after being here for so long."</p><p></p><p>Tong Xin shook his head and sighed, a hint of discontent in his tone.</p><p></p><p>Lin Dong smiled wryly, "Brother, our master's whereabouts are unknown at the moment."</p><p></p><p>Tong Xin chuckled, "Then let's first get out of this desert and try to find him, and along the way, we can ask around about the master."</p><p></p><p>Chen Dadao simply listened to the two with a smile, only his eyes flickering slightly when he heard the word "master".</p><p></p><p>"You little rascals!"</p><p></p><p>At this moment, a scolding voice rang out.</p><p></p><p>Here is the full English translation of the Chinese excerpt:</p><p></p><p>The three disciples of Tongxin were stunned, and quickly turned their heads to look.</p><p></p><p>They saw three figures standing there, with the white-bearded old man in the middle smiling benevolently, just as he had been before.</p><p></p><p>"Master!" </p><p></p><p>The three disciples of Tongxin were amazed and then overjoyed, rushing over quickly.</p><p></p><p>"Master, it's been over a thousand years, your disciples have missed you so much!" </p><p></p><p>Tongxin directly rushed into the embrace of Gu Helin, speaking excitedly.</p><p></p><p>Gu Helin patted Tongxin's shoulder, with a look of emotion on his face. He glanced at Lin Dong and Chen Daozhao and said with a smile, "I guessed that you all would have ascended to immortality by now, so I came here early to wait for you."</p><p></p><p>"Thank you, Master."</p><p></p><p>Lin Dong and Chen Daozhao bowed respectfully, their eyes also slightly trembling.</p><p></p><p>Just arriving in this unfamiliar immortal realm, they had already encountered Gu Helin, and their hearts were also greatly excited.</p><p></p><p>Hai Dong and Wu Che exchanged a glance and smiled, so that's how it is.</p><p></p><p>"Haha, these are your Shibo (uncle) Hai and Shibo Wu, quickly pay your respects."</p><p></p><p>Gu Helin began to introduce Hai Dong and Wu Che.</p><p></p><p>"Greetings Shibo Hai, Shibo Wu."</p><p></p><p>The three disciples of Tongxin naturally did not dare to be negligent, and quickly paid their respects.</p><p></p><p>Hai Dong and Wu Che nodded approvingly as they looked over the three in front of them, their faces filled with admiration.</p><p></p><p>They didn't expect the three disciples of their junior brother Gu to have such monstrous talents! </p><p></p><p>Their aptitude seems to be even better than their junior brother Gu's.</p><p></p><p>Looking at this, as long as they are given time to settle, the White Moon Sect will surely soar to great heights.</p><p></p><p>"Haha good! You three junior disciples, please rise!"</p><p></p><p>Hai Dong raised his hand and used his immortal spiritual power to lift the bodies of the three who were bowing.</p><p></p><p>"Thank you, Shibo."</p><p></p><p>The three disciples of Tongxin were impeccable in their etiquette, which made Hai Dong and Wu Che even more satisfied.</p><p></p><p>"Junior brother Gu, take these three junior disciples back to the sect first, what are you standing in this wasteland for, blowing in the sand? If you want to catch up, go back first."</p><p></p><p>Hai Dong looked at Gu Helin and pretended to scold him.</p><p></p><p>Gu Helin smiled and said, "Haha yes yes yes, Tongxin, Lin Dong, Daozhao, you follow your Master and the two Shifu back to the sect."</p><p></p><p>"Yes."</p><p></p><p>The eyes of the three disciples of Tongxin were filled with anticipation, not knowing what the sect in the immortal realm would be like, it should be more grand than the Qingyun Sect, right?</p><p></p><p>"Oh right, Master." Tongxin suddenly called out.</p><p></p><p>Gu Helin's body paused, and he turned around with a puzzled look.</p><p></p><p>Tongxin lowered his head, and Lin Dong and Chen Daozhao seemed to know what Tongxin wanted to say, and the joy in their eyes also subsided.</p><p></p><p>"What's wrong?" Gu Helin asked.</p><p></p><p>Tongxin softly said, "The Sect Master, because of the damage to his sea of consciousness in his early years, failed to break through to the Divine Transformation Realm, and was killed by the Heavenly Tribulation."</p><p></p><p>Gu Helin's pupils trembled, his mouth slightly opened, but for a moment he did not know what to say.</p><p></p><p>Hai Dong and Wu Che were silent.</p><p></p><p>"Let's go back to the sect first."</p><p></p><p>Finally, Gu Helin sighed towards the sky.</p><p></p><p>...</p><p></p><p>"Wow, Master, the sect in the immortal realm is so grand! Our Qingyun Sect in the Mortal Realm, although it is the leader of the cultivation world, is nothing compared to this place, it's not even close!"</p><p></p><p>Looking at the endless mountains and rivers, Tongxin couldn't help but exclaim.</p><p></p><p>Lin Dong and Chen Daozhao were also dumbfounded, they had never seen such a grand sect before.</p><p></p><p>"Haha, you three junior disciples, don't be afraid to laugh at us. Our White Moon Sect has just recently been promoted to a one-star sect, although we have a rank, we are still the lowest level sect in the immortal realm, and only have some standing in this Langtiandomain."</p><p></p><p>Wu Che said somewhat embarrassedly.</p><p></p><p>What? This is still the lowest level sect?</p><p></p><p>The three disciples of Tongxin were shocked, looking at each other in disbelief.</p>

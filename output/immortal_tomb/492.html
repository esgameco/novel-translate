        <h1>Chapter 492</h1>
        <div class="content">
            <p>Here is the full English translation of the Chinese excerpt:</p><p></p><p>Lu Changsheng's words fell, and the ten disciples of the Sword Deity Sect shuddered, and fear finally appeared in their eyes!</p><p></p><p>The leading disciple of the Sword Deity Sect hurriedly shouted:</p><p></p><p>"Run! Return to the sect's territory and report to the elders!!"</p><p></p><p>The next moment, the ten disciples of the Sword Deity Sect gritted their teeth and fled into the void, retreating towards the direction of the sect's territory!</p><p></p><p>Lu Changsheng's expression was calm, and he murmured lightly, "One breath... three breaths, it seems they are still not worthy of the opportunity."</p><p></p><p>As soon as he finished speaking, in the void, the ten frantically fleeing disciples of the Sword Deity Sect suddenly felt their hair stand on end, and a great terror arose in their hearts.</p><p></p><p>The next moment - boom!</p><p></p><p>Before these disciples of the Sword Deity Sect could react, they lost consciousness and fell into a deep sleep in the void.</p><p></p><p>Lu Changsheng said indifferently, "Let's go, to the central region."</p><p></p><p>"Yes." The old turtle quickly responded, then carried Lu Changsheng and rushed into the central region, continuing towards the deeper part.</p><p></p><p>The deeper part, of course, is where the laws are the most concentrated!</p><p></p><p>At the same time, the nine peak forces had already dispatched a large number of cultivators in the central region to urgently set up a guard, and they also wanted to find the reason for the sudden and mysterious collapse of the seven-colored barrier.</p><p></p><p>However, no matter how the nine peak forces searched, they could not find the reason for the collapse of the seven-colored barrier.</p><p></p><p>At this moment, the furious shout of the Sword Deity Sect elder suddenly sounded in the central region:</p><p></p><p>"The ten disciples of our Sword Deity Sect guarding the southeast direction have all died, and it is suspected that someone has intruded!"</p><p></p><p>What?!</p><p></p><p>The sudden exclamation startled the disciples of the Tianxian Clan, the Nine Underworld Palace, the Zhen Mo Valley, and the Qin, Li, Wang, and Chu clans!</p><p></p><p>Hearing the Sword Deity Sect elder's words, could it be that the collapse of the seven-colored barrier is related to the intruder?</p><p></p><p>This...</p><p></p><p>This matter cannot be thought about too much, the more one thinks about it, the more absurd and terrifying it becomes. When did such a powerful person come to the Ascending Heaven Island?!</p><p></p><p>This seven-colored barrier was laid down by the nine high-level experts of the nine peak forces.</p><p></p><p>And these nine high-level experts are all at the realm of Shen Kong Seven Turns, that is, the level of the Seven Turns Laws.</p><p></p><p>For someone to be able to break the seven-colored barrier, they would have to be at least at the Shen Kong Eight Turns realm, which belongs to the super-powerful realm of the Sea of Laws!</p><p></p><p>The Chu Clan elder frowned deeply, and suddenly a voice from a clan disciple came through the spiritual transmission:</p><p></p><p>"Elder! Emergency situation! I discovered that a person and a turtle are heading towards the core region!"</p><p></p><p>What?! The Chu Clan elder was dumbfounded, and then he quickly shouted:</p><p></p><p>"All clan elders, there is an intruder in the core region, all of you quickly follow this elder to intercept him!!"</p><p></p><p>What?!</p><p></p><p>The next moment, nine figures, including the Chu Clan elder, burst out from the nine directions of the central region and quickly rushed towards the core region!</p><p></p><p>As for the clan disciples, the nine high-level experts did not bring any of them,</p><p></p><p>because if the intruder is truly above the Shen Kong Eight Turns realm, then no matter how many disciples they bring, it would be useless!</p><p></p><p>At this moment, the nine high-level experts only want to intercept the intruder and see what kind of extraordinary person dares to challenge the nine peak forces!</p><p></p><p>"All of you disperse and guard the edges of the central region, report any situation immediately!"</p><p></p><p>"Yes!"</p><p></p><p>...</p><p></p><p>"Master, it seems that there are nine auras rushing towards our direction, and they are filled with killing intent."</p><p></p><p>The old turtle frowned and said.</p><p></p><p>Lu Changsheng closed his eyes and said, "Once we reach the core region, you can sit down and start cultivating, don't worry about the rest."</p><p></p><p>"Understood!"</p><p></p><p>The old turtle responded, and once again increased its speed!</p><p></p><p>Just after Lu Changsheng and the old turtle left,</p><p></p><p>nine figures suddenly appeared at this place, staring intently at the direction they had left.</p><p></p><p>One person and one turtle!</p><p></p><p>This person is most likely a cultivator above the Shen Kong Eight Turns realm!</p><p></p><p>The high-level experts of the nine peak forces could not understand it, they really could not understand it!</p><p></p><p>This person has already reached such a realm, and his laws have also reached the Eight Turns realm, yet he still comes to the Ascending Heaven Island? </p><p></p><p>What exactly is this person's purpose in coming to the core region?!</p><p></p><p>The nine high-level experts were furious and puzzled at the same time!</p><p></p><p>"Chase, no matter what this person's purpose is, we must find a way to capture him and interrogate him about his intentions!"</p><p></p><p>With these words, the nine high-level experts' law powers flashed, and they swiftly gave chase!</p><p></p><p>Shen Kong Eight Turns may be powerful, but so what? Although they are only at the Shen Kong Seven Turns realm, they are from the peak forces and must have their own methods!</p><p></p><p>...</p><p></p><p>Ascending Heaven Island</p><p></p><p>Here is the full English translation of the Chinese excerpt:</p><p></p><p>In the core region of the central area, there stood a towering snow-capped mountain that reached up to the clouds.</p><p></p><p>And the peak of this towering snow mountain was the very core, the absolute center of Dengtiandao!</p><p></p><p>In the icy and snowy land, Lu Changsheng stretched out his bony hand and pointed to the peak of the snow mountain. Old Turtle immediately understood, and swooped towards that place!</p><p></p><p>Although the mountain was thousands of feet high, Old Turtle reached the summit in the blink of an eye.</p><p></p><p>Upon reaching the peak of the snow mountain, Old Turtle first crouched down, and after Lu Changsheng got off its back, it quickly transformed into a human form. Remembering Lu Changsheng's instructions, Old Turtle quickly went to the side and sat down cross-legged on the spot!</p><p></p><p>"My lord, I will start comprehending it now..." Old Turtle said respectfully, making hand seals and slowly closing its eyes.</p><p></p><p>The moment Old Turtle closed its eyes, the dense laws of power in the core region began to pulsate!</p><p></p><p>Lu Changsheng did not even look at Old Turtle, but walked slowly to the edge of the cliff, clasping his hands behind his back and looking down below. In the mountains, pure white mist swirled, and the bottom could not be seen.</p><p></p><p>At the peak of the snow mountain, the howling wind kept blowing, making Lu Changsheng's blue robe flutter ceaselessly. In the hazy mist, his figure in blue seemed to be that of a mysterious immortal.</p><p></p><p>At this moment, nine figures suddenly appeared in front of him, disrupting this scene. Their eyes were firmly fixed on the unfamiliar-looking Lu Changsheng and the Old Turtle sitting in meditation behind him!</p><p></p><p>These nine figures were naturally the nine senior figures who had been pursuing him.</p><p></p><p>At this moment, they finally knew why this powerful expert who had broken through the Divine Void Eight Turns had intruded - it was all because of that old turtle!</p><p></p><p>And this young man in blue robes possessed the strength of the Divine Void Eight Turns, which the nine senior figures had never heard of or seen before!</p><p></p><p>"Sir, you have forcibly intruded into the territory of our nine major forces, which is not appropriate, is it?" </p><p></p><p>"That's right, as is widely known, the central area of Dengtiandao is occupied by our nine major forces. You are the first one to dare to forcibly enter!"</p><p></p><p>"If you leave this peak of the snow mountain immediately, we may not pursue your offense if we are in a good mood."</p><p></p><p>"..."</p><p></p><p>The nine senior figures spoke one after another.</p><p></p><p>In their eyes, Lu Changsheng was after all a powerful expert who had broken through the Divine Void Eight Turns, not easy to deal with. It would be better to lure him out of the Wanzhang Snow Mountain first before taking any action.</p><p></p><p>After all, if a battle were to break out here, the ecological balance of this place would be disrupted, which would be a great loss!</p><p></p><p>The Wanzhang Snow Mountain, as the core region, was of immense importance!</p><p></p><p>Hehe, the nine peak forces... According to Chu Yu's memories, it seems that the Chu Clan had people guarding this place, right?</p><p></p><p>How interesting.</p><p></p><p>Lu Changsheng then looked at the Chu Clan elder among the nine senior figures with a smile in his eyes.</p><p></p><p>The Chu Clan elder was puzzled by this gaze.</p><p></p><p>"You all just stay there and watch. When my mount has finished comprehending the laws, I will take the time to have a good talk with you."</p><p></p><p>Suddenly, Lu Changsheng's feet left the ground, and he slowly levitated into the air, his hands clasped behind his back.</p><p></p><p>The nine senior figures were immediately furious, thinking him an arrogant cultivator!</p><p></p><p>Just as they were about to make a move, they were shocked to find that they were somehow restrained and unable to budge no matter how hard they tried.</p><p></p><p>The nine senior figures were suddenly shaken, and their gazes towards the young man in blue robes were now filled with fear and bitterness.</p><p></p><p>But the next moment, an even more terrifying scene unfolded!</p><p></p><p>Lu Changsheng's robes fluttered, and a deep blue light began to emanate from his entire body, with waves of profound Dao rhythms that made the nine senior figures feel their spiritual souls shaking.</p><p></p><p>The deep blue light in Lu Changsheng's eyes grew even more profound, and then he spoke lightly, his voice like the sacred sound of the Great Dao, resounding across the vast Dengtiandao:</p><p></p><p>"Come!"</p><p></p><p>Boom!</p><p></p><p>Suddenly, the sky around Dengtiandao was filled with lightning and thunderous roars, the majestic divine might shaking the hearts and souls of all. In the blink of an eye, a torrential downpour began to pour down!</p><p></p><p>And on Dengtiandao...</p><p></p><p>All the cultivators were dumbfounded as they sensed the laws of power around them suddenly surging wildly, like raging waves, rushing towards the central region!</p><p></p><p>At this moment, the three thousand laws of Dengtiandao were all converging towards the central region!</p><p></p><p>It was as if there was a supreme sovereign standing there, with arms outstretched, awaiting their pilgrimage!</p>

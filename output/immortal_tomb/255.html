        <h1>Chapter 255</h1>
        <div class="content">
            <p>Here is the full English translation of the Chinese excerpt:</p><p></p><p>In the Crimson Celestial Divine Realm, the Palace of the Divine Emperor. üíó‚úé‚ûÖ‚ûàùìº–ΩœÖùîµ.ùì¨·µíÔº≠‚úåüëπ</p><p></p><p>A majestic old man in a yellow robe stood outside the palace, looking at the black-armored man in front of him and said calmly:</p><p></p><p>"Xing Tian, summon the other guardians."</p><p></p><p>"Yes, Divine Emperor." Xing Tian bowed in response.</p><p></p><p>With a thought, he immediately transmitted the message to the other guardians.</p><p></p><p>In no time, eight armored figures appeared almost simultaneously.</p><p></p><p>The eight men placed their right hands over their left chests and bowed: "We, the First Guard, pay our respects to the Divine Emperor!"</p><p></p><p>Yin Yao's eyes flashed with a smile as he said, "Rise."</p><p></p><p>"Thank you, Divine Emperor!"</p><p></p><p>The guardians stood up.</p><p></p><p>Xing Tian took his place at the head of the guardian formation.</p><p></p><p>The nine of them were the nine great guardians under the Divine Emperor of the Ancestral Heavenly Realm, each with extraordinary cultivation and power!</p><p></p><p>In the Ancestral Heavenly Realm, no one other than the Divine Emperor himself could appoint them.</p><p></p><p>Yin Yao scanned the nine great guardians with a slightly satisfied expression, then squinted his eyes and said, "You shall accompany me to the Heavenly Sound Monastery. As for Monk Jing Guan... it's truly a pity."</p><p></p><p>He was well aware that Jing Guan had most likely perished in a calamity.</p><p></p><p>After all, in this Ancestral Heavenly Realm, aside from himself, there were only a few who had the ability to kill Jing Guan: the old Taoist from the Heavenly Evolving Taoist Sanctuary, the old demon who fell into the Abyss of Fallen Demons, and the ancient demon from the Endless Demonic Abyss.</p><p></p><p>It could be said that these three were the only ones who posed a threat to Jing Guan, but even they did not have the power to kill him.</p><p></p><p>Even for Yin Yao himself, killing Jing Guan would not be an easy task.</p><p></p><p>Jing Guan's death would be beneficial, as it would prevent him from attaining Buddhahood, which would not be advantageous for the Divine Emperor's Palace.</p><p></p><p>The upcoming ceremony to praise Jing Guan was a must-attend event. There were two reasons for this: first, to showcase the grandeur of the Divine Emperor's Palace, and second, to take the opportunity to suppress the various peak powers that would gather.</p><p></p><p>Lately, there had been undercurrents among the peak powers in the Ancestral Heavenly Realm, and some even seemed to have colluded with the Abyss of Fallen Demons and the Endless Demonic Abyss!</p><p></p><p>It seems that the Divine Emperor had not shown himself for a long time...</p><p></p><p>"Xing Tian, send the order to all the Divine King Halls. Let the Divine Kings put aside all their current affairs and attend the praising ceremony," Yin Yao said.</p><p></p><p>Xing Tian bowed, "Divine Emperor, I have already issued the order earlier."</p><p></p><p>"Good!" Yin Yao's gaze turned towards the clouds outside the palace, his eyes seemingly piercing through the mountains and rivers, "Depart for the Heavenly Sound Monastery."</p><p></p><p>"As you command!"</p><p></p><p>.........</p><p></p><p>In the Crimson Celestial Divine Realm, at the Heavenly Evolving Taoist Sanctuary,</p><p></p><p>In the serene courtyard, an elderly Taoist with a crane-like brow, holding a Buddhist relic, looked towards the distant Heavenly Sound Monastery.</p><p></p><p>Zhang Sheng Xu smiled meaningfully and said, "Twelve Dao Disciples, follow me to the Heavenly Sound Monastery."</p><p></p><p>In an instant, twelve Taoist priests and priestesses in simple robes appeared outside the courtyard, and they respectfully bowed, "Yes, Dao Master!"</p><p></p><p>.........</p><p></p><p>At the same time, Ye Wutian from the Heavenly Saint Divine Realm was also leading his high-level disciples towards the Heavenly Sound Monastery in the Crimson Celestial Divine Realm.</p><p></p><p>The Divine King Halls of the other major Divine Realms and other peak powers had also begun to move.</p><p></p><p>Only the Abyss of Fallen Demons and the Endless Demonic Abyss, shrouded in mist outside the six major Divine Realms, remained silent and motionless.</p><p></p><p>This was only natural, as it would be abnormal for them to attend the ceremony, as that was the Divine Emperor's domain.</p><p></p><p>As time passed, the news of Monk Jing Guan's passing spread, no longer confined to just the peak powers.</p><p></p><p>The six major Divine Realms and countless forces had learned of this earth-shattering event.</p><p></p><p>The death of a renowned Buddhist master had caused a great commotion throughout the Ancestral Heavenly Realm.</p><p></p><p>Countless Buddhists and Taoists found it difficult to accept.</p><p></p><p>Here is the full English translation of the Chinese excerpt:</p><p></p><p>After learning that the Praise Ceremony was about to be held, many were filled with grief and rushed to the Buddhist and Taoist holy land, the Tianyin Temple.</p><p></p><p>As for the Taoist cultivators, they were overjoyed. They knew that the Tianyuan Taoist Observatory would not miss this opportunity and would undoubtedly stir up a commotion during the ceremony.</p><p></p><p>Suddenly, the Praise Ceremony at the Tianyin Temple became a focus of great attention.</p><p></p><p>Countless Immortal Emperor realm cultivators rushed to the Qixiao Divine Realm, to the Xueshan Mountains.</p><p></p><p>No one wanted to miss this grand event.</p><p></p><p>As for the cultivators below the Immortal Emperor realm, they dared not go due to their own cultivation levels, as the ceremony would be dominated by the great figures.</p><p></p><p>...</p><p></p><p>Yanyang Qiu, accompanied by several elders, arrived at the Longevity Medical Hall in Yanwu Town.</p><p></p><p>He still had a seven-colored spirit stone in his hand, which he owed to Doctor Lu. He had forgotten to return it last time, so he passed by to return it.</p><p></p><p>He also wanted to ask Doctor Lu if he would like to go to the Qixiao Divine Realm.</p><p></p><p>He was somewhat anxious, as Cloud Maiden from the Upper Clear Palace had already taken several elders there.</p><p></p><p>Soon, Tongxin came out of the medical hall, looking puzzled at Yanyang Qiu and the others. "Senior predecessors, are you looking for the master? The master left a few days ago."</p><p></p><p>Yanyang Qiu was startled and asked, "Where did Doctor Lu go?"</p><p></p><p>"The master went to attend that Praise Ceremony," Tongxin said.</p><p></p><p>Yanyang Qiu's body trembled! He sighed inwardly, "Indeed! Such an earth-shattering event, even Doctor Lu couldn't resist the temptation to go and see the excitement!"</p><p></p><p>"Okay, thank you for the information!" Yanyang Qiu tossed the seven-colored spirit stone in his hand to Tongxin, who caught it in a daze.</p><p></p><p>He stared blankly at the seven-colored spirit stone in his palm, unsure of Yanyang Qiu's intentions. Was this a sign of disrespect towards him, Tongxin?</p><p></p><p>Tongxin's face flushed red and purple, feeling insulted by the gesture.</p><p></p><p>But when he looked up, Yanyang Qiu and the others had already disappeared.</p><p></p><p>...</p><p></p><p>The Soul Realm.</p><p></p><p>"Hiss!" The old butler and the group of soul servants watched the scene before them with a sharp intake of breath.</p><p></p><p>In front of them, there was a golden-glowing soul body, hands clasped, eyes closed, slowly drifting towards the shores of the Reincarnation Lake.</p><p></p><p>Wherever it passed, all the soul bodies frantically fled and scattered, causing chaos.</p><p></p><p>When had they ever seen such a soul body?</p><p></p><p>They could only watch helplessly as the golden-glowing soul body drifted towards that direction, not daring to obstruct it.</p><p></p><p>The golden light that enveloped it was extremely oppressive to them. If they approached any closer, they had a premonition that their souls would be scattered.</p><p></p><p>"This... This... We must find a way to notify the Soul Emperor immediately!! You all stay here and watch! I'll go tell the head of the Huiyou Gate."</p><p></p><p>The old butler hurriedly flew in one direction.</p><p></p><p>But before he could go far, a middle-aged man with fiery red hair and a single horn on his forehead suddenly appeared in the area!</p><p></p><p>"Soul... Soul Emperor!" The soul servants trembled, as if seeing a savior, and quickly bowed down, respectfully calling out.</p><p></p><p>The old butler's soul body paused and quickly turned back.</p><p></p><p>The Soul Meng paid no attention to the old butler and the others, striding towards the golden-glowing soul body. In the next moment, he appeared before the golden-glowing soul body, looking down at it.</p><p></p><p>The golden-glowing soul body still had its hands clasped, eyes tightly closed, as if trying to pass through Soul Meng's body and continue deeper.</p><p></p><p>Soul Meng raised his hand towards the golden-glowing soul body, fingers spread wide, and a complex blood seal flashed in his palm. "Stop."</p><p></p><p>The next moment, the golden-glowing soul body halted in its tracks!</p><p></p><p>The golden-glowing soul body opened its eyes, looking up at the red-haired middle-aged man with a puzzled expression, hands still clasped. "I... Who am I?"</p>

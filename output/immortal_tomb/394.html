        <h1>Chapter 394</h1>
        <div class="content">
            <p>Here is the full English translation of the Chinese excerpt:</p><p></p><p>Human Realm.</p><p></p><p>The five Human Realm Overlords gathered, their eyes trembling as they gazed at the hazy sky.</p><p></p><p>"Ascending to the Divine..." Jiang Wuxin murmured. "Literally, it should mean breaking through to the Divine Realm, otherwise the Heavenly Dao wouldn't be involved."</p><p></p><p>The expressions of Jian Wuhui and the others gradually became grave. If the Divine Lord truly broke through... the consequences would be unimaginable.</p><p></p><p>Han Jinlong said helplessly, "No wonder the myriad races have not descended for a long time, no wonder even the top ten great clans don't care about their own holy sons and daughters - it turns out they're waiting for the Divine Lord to break through the Divine Realm..."</p><p></p><p>Man Tian pursed his lips, "With Lord Lu around, we might have had a chance even against the leaders of the top ten great clans, but the Divine Realm..."</p><p></p><p>As he spoke, Man Tian's expression became extremely bitter.</p><p></p><p>It wasn't that he lacked confidence in Lu Changsheng's strength - everyone had witnessed Lu Changsheng's power.</p><p></p><p>It was just that the three words "Divine Realm" were filled with unparalleled oppression.</p><p></p><p>After all, it was a legendary realm.</p><p></p><p>The Divine Realm, the Divine Realm, it must be the true Divine Beings.</p><p></p><p>Jian Wuhui said in a solemn voice, "Don't think too much about it. What's meant to come will come. Now we can only pray that the Divine Lord's breakthrough fails."</p><p></p><p>Hearing this, the group fell silent, furrowing their brows and focusing on the situation. The cultivators of the entire Human Realm were also in a state of extreme tension, except for the old turtle who was sleeping soundly.</p><p></p><p>...</p><p></p><p>At the same time, in the Divine Realm.</p><p></p><p>Above the sky, in addition to the Divine Elemental, there seemed to be something else...</p><p></p><p>"The shackles of the Divine-Demonic Battlefield have been opened, and I have also helped you introduce the Mysterious Spiritual Energy. Whether you can break through now depends on you," the Heavenly Dao said faintly.</p><p></p><p>Divine Lord felt his heart pounding as he sensed the Mysterious Spiritual Energy in the air, completely different from the Divine Elemental.</p><p></p><p>Regarding the Divine Realm, he had already gained insights. Now, all he had to do was to absorb the Mysterious Spiritual Energy in the air, and he might be able to smoothly ascend to the Divine Realm!</p><p></p><p>However, the process of absorbing the Mysterious Spiritual Energy was also very dangerous.</p><p></p><p>In addition to the nine great clan leaders, another dangerous aspect was when he replaced the Divine Elemental within his body with the Mysterious Spiritual Energy. If his body was not compatible or there was a problem in any step, it would be fatal.</p><p></p><p>Soon, Divine Lord's gaze sharpened, no longer hesitating. He looked at the illusory Heavenly Dao and cupped his hands, "Thank you, great Heavenly Dao, for introducing the Mysterious Spiritual Energy."</p><p></p><p>The Heavenly Dao shook his head, glanced at the Imprisoning Divine Formation on the side, and then looked deeply at Divine Lord before dissipating.</p><p></p><p>Divine Lord's expression became grave. He immediately sat down to begin absorbing the Mysterious Spiritual Energy, not daring to delay.</p><p></p><p>He had to hurry and absorb all the Mysterious Spiritual Energy in the air before Bi Youao, Zhen Tian, and the other great clan leaders broke through the Imprisoning Divine Formation!</p><p></p><p>Although Divine Lord knew that Bi You and the other great clan leaders were not proficient in formations, he couldn't be sure that no accidents would occur. After all, to become the leaders of the top ten great clans, they must have some tricks up their sleeves.</p><p></p><p>Today was indeed somewhat dangerous, but he would seek fortune in the midst of danger. As long as he succeeded in breaking through to the Divine Realm, he could lead the Divine Realm Tribe to greater glory!</p><p></p><p>At that time, not only the Beast Tribe and the Dragon Tribe, even the entire Divine-Demonic Battlefield would have to kneel before him, the Divine Lord!</p><p></p><p>Divine Lord even had a feeling that as long as he attained the Divine Realm, he might even be able to arm-wrestle with the Heavenly Dao of the Divine-Demonic Battlefield!</p><p></p><p>Thinking of this, a scorching heat arose in Divine Lord's heart. He then took a deep breath, assumed a stance, and began to focus on absorbing the Mysterious Spiritual Energy.</p><p></p><p>Gradually, his face became pale, and his expression was agonized. Replacing the Divine Elemental with the Mysterious Spiritual Energy felt like having one's tendons and bones torn apart, just like ordinary people experiencing muscle cramps.</p><p></p><p>The Divine Realm Tribe members watched the Divine Lord, who had clearly entered a state of cultivation in the sky, not daring to make a sound. If it weren't for the continuous rumbling of the black thunderbolts crashing into the Imprisoning Divine Formation and the clanging of the chains, it would have been eerily quiet.</p><p></p><p>...</p><p></p><p>"Sigh! At this moment, Divine Lord is probably already beginning to break through to the Divine Realm, while we are still trapped in this Imprisoning Divine Formation! Damn it! Damn it!!"</p><p></p><p>Inside the Imprisoning Divine Formation, one of the clan leaders finally lost his composure and started cursing.</p><p></p><p>The other clan leaders all had solemn expressions, remaining silent. They could understand his feelings.</p><p></p><p>Because if Divine Lord succeeded in his breakthrough...</p><p></p><p>Here is my translation of the Chinese excerpt:</p><p></p><p>Having broken through to the Divine Realm, those nine of them... whether they live or die is unknown, but they definitely won't be able to get away with it.</p><p></p><p>"Ah! I don't know if the Heavenly Crow Clan Chief has made any progress in searching for the formation's eye!"</p><p></p><p>"Don't disturb him, we can only wait now!"</p><p></p><p>"......"</p><p></p><p>The clan chiefs surrounded the Heavenly Crow Clan Chief, blocking the incoming thunderbolts and chains one by one.</p><p></p><p>As for the Heavenly Crow Clan Chief at the center, he maintained a posture with his brow furrowed, drenched in sweat, as he used his divine sense to control the countless crows and monitor each one's condition.</p><p></p><p>For him, the consumption was also enormous!</p><p></p><p>...</p><p></p><p>Outside, Divine Thunderclap was still continuously refining the Mysterious Spirit. As he removed the divine elements and the Mysterious Spirit entered his body, his body gradually began to emit a hazy glow, and his aura became increasingly mysterious!</p><p></p><p>Under this special glow, the members of the Heavenly God Clan trembled in their hearts and couldn't help but kneel on the ground.</p><p></p><p>It was as if an unparalleled suppression, as if Divine Thunderclap merely sitting there, they could not move at all!</p><p></p><p>"So... so powerful! Even if the Great Lord of the Heavenly God Clan has not yet advanced to the Divine Realm, this aura is terrifying to the extreme!"</p><p></p><p>"It's unimaginable how powerful he will be once he breaks through!"</p><p></p><p>"Our Great Lord of the Heavenly God Clan will soon be able to crush all the tribes on the Divine-Demonic Battlefield!"</p><p></p><p>"......"</p><p></p><p>While the members of the Heavenly God Clan were secretly and excitedly transmitting their discussions, inside the Imprisoning Divine Formation, the Heavenly Crow Clan Chief suddenly opened his eyes, panting heavily: "Everyone, the formation's eye has been found!! It's a black grass 1,000 steps inside the Qian direction, a vine 300 steps inside the Kan direction, and..."</p><p></p><p>The clan chiefs were overjoyed beyond measure, not even bothering to praise the Heavenly Crow Clan Chief, and immediately directed their divine sense towards the locations he mentioned, quickly erasing those hidden formation eyes.</p><p></p><p>Sure enough, the raging thunderbolts and chains inside the Imprisoning Divine Formation dissipated at the same moment!</p><p></p><p>The scene before everyone's eyes became clear, and they could clearly see the kneeling Shen Yue and Shen Xing, as well as the many members of the Heavenly God Clan!</p><p></p><p>They were worshipping the resplendent Divine Thunderclap in the sky!!</p><p></p><p>Bi You and the others looked at Divine Thunderclap, feeling his aura becoming increasingly terrifying...</p><p></p><p>"Stop him!!!"</p><p></p><p>Bi You shouted loudly and flashed towards the Divine Thunderclap in the sky along with clan chiefs like Ao Zhengtian!</p><p></p><p>As for the Heavenly Crow Clan Chief, he had already exhausted his strength and could no longer move.</p><p></p><p>Shen Yue and Shen Xing were greatly alarmed in their hearts, and they immediately rose up, urgently shouting, "Block them!!"</p><p></p><p>After saying that, Shen Yue and Shen Xing immediately rushed up without any regard for their own safety.</p><p></p><p>But how could they, as mere divine officials, stop the powerful clan chiefs like Bi You? They were instantly knocked away!</p><p></p><p>And the members of the Heavenly God Clan were the same! If Bi You and the others had not been in a hurry and wasted time on the Heavenly God Clan members, those Heavenly God Clan members would probably have already suffered heavy casualties.</p><p></p><p>Seeing the clan chiefs rapidly approaching the Great Lord of the Heavenly God Clan, Shen Yue and Shen Xing's faces turned deathly pale!</p><p></p><p>Bi You and the others then heaved a sigh of relief, finally catching up, and their eyes turned fierce...</p><p></p><p>But in that instant, Divine Thunderclap's eyes suddenly opened, erupting with dazzling brilliance!</p><p></p><p>Divine Thunderclap abruptly stood up and lightly slapped out with his hand.</p><p></p><p>Boom!!!</p><p></p><p>Bi You and the other clan chiefs were blasted, spitting out a mouthful of blood, and then fell down like meteors towards the ground, crashing into the earth with a loud thud, their life or death unknown!</p><p></p><p>The Heavenly Crow Clan Chief on the cliff watched this scene in terror, his whole body trembling with fear.</p><p></p><p>One... one move...</p><p></p><p>Divine Thunderclap looked down at the shattered ground below with an indifferent expression, and then lowered his gaze to his palm, the corners of his mouth curling into an ever-widening smile, until he threw his head back and burst into wild laughter:</p><p></p><p>"From this moment on, the Divine-Demonic Battlefield shall have me, the Supreme Overlord, the Supreme Divine Cultivator!! Hahaha!!"</p>

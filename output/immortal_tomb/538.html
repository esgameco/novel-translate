        <h1>Chapter 538</h1>
        <div class="content">
            <p>Here is the full English translation of the Chinese excerpt:</p><p></p><p>The group from the Daoyan Sect, from the elders down to the junior disciples, were all stunned when they saw the old man rushing towards them, fishing rod in hand, without a word.</p><p></p><p>When did the folk customs of the Star Luo Empire become so fierce?</p><p></p><p>An ordinary person, and an old man at that, actually dared to lay hands on them, the Martial Cultivators?</p><p></p><p>This is outrageous!</p><p></p><p>One of the disciples regained his senses, a sword blade appearing in his hand as he pointed it at Old Xu, roaring, "Presumptuous commoner! Seeking death!"</p><p></p><p>As the words left his mouth, the sword in his hand shot out a faint glow towards Old Xu.</p><p></p><p>Martial Cultivators!</p><p></p><p>But Old Xu had already regained his composure when the other drew his sword. He abruptly stopped in his tracks, his mind going blank as he watched the sword blade approaching.</p><p></p><p>In response, the elder and steward of the Daoyan Sect remained expressionless. </p><p></p><p>This old man dared to challenge them, so his fate was only natural. </p><p></p><p>Mere insects, their deaths were of no consequence.</p><p></p><p>"Old Xu, I've caught a fish too."</p><p></p><p>At this moment, Lu Changsheng smiled faintly and gave a light tug on his rod. A large fish was pulled out of the water, tracing a graceful parabolic arc before detaching from the line and landing right in front of Old Xu.</p><p></p><p>"Shing!"</p><p></p><p>The sharp sword blade instantly pierced through the belly of the large fish, but the sword seemed to have lost its momentum, falling to the ground along with the impaled fish.</p><p></p><p>This scene unfolded in the blink of an eye!</p><p></p><p>Old Xu regained his senses, looking down at the sword in front of him with a ghastly pale face, panting heavily.</p><p></p><p>The members of the Daoyan Sect also had a change in their expressions, suddenly staring intently at the calm, robed young man sitting there.</p><p></p><p>This person is no ordinary individual!</p><p></p><p>"Such a large fish, we'll have delicious fish soup to drink tonight."</p><p></p><p>At this point, Lu Changsheng put down his rod, standing up with a smile and feigning surprise as he looked at the Daoyan Sect members.</p><p></p><p>Then, with his hands behind his back, he walked over to Old Xu's side, glancing around for a moment before asking in confusion, "Hmm, where's the big fish I just caught? Old Xu, did you see it?"</p><p></p><p>Old Xu, still shaken, swallowed hard and pointed a trembling finger at the fish in front of him. "Mr. Lu, this is the fish you just caught. But..."</p><p></p><p>Oh? Found it?</p><p></p><p>Lu Changsheng patted his chest, relieved, a smile appearing on his face. It's good that it's been found.</p><p></p><p>But very soon!</p><p></p><p>When Lu Changsheng saw that his big fish had been pierced and gutted by the sword, his expression turned cold.</p><p></p><p>Lu Changsheng immediately pointed at the slain fish and asked indifferently, "Who killed my fish?"</p><p></p><p>The Daoyan Sect members looked at each other, puzzled. Wasn't it you who intentionally brought the fish over?</p><p></p><p>The Daoyan Sect elder's gaze narrowed as he warned, "This elder knows you have some abilities, but it's best to be more low-key. Those who die from arrogance are often those with some abilities."</p><p></p><p>Old Xu was a bit afraid, worried that he might implicate Lu Changsheng, so he gently tugged on Lu Changsheng's sleeve from behind. "Mr. Lu..."</p><p></p><p>Lu Changsheng paid no heed, calmly saying, "Three breaths. If the culprit who killed my fish is not revealed within three breaths, then you will all perish together."</p><p></p><p>Upon hearing this, not only Old Xu was startled, but the Daoyan Sect members were also taken aback!</p><p></p><p>Who is this guy? So arrogant?</p><p></p><p>In the Star Luo Empire, the Tianwu Sect is the strongest, but they wouldn't dare to look down on the Daoyan Sect like this!</p><p></p><p>The Daoyan Sect is a prominent sect, after all!</p><p></p><p>"Three breaths have passed."</p><p></p><p>At this moment, Lu Changsheng spoke calmly.</p><p></p><p>The Daoyan Sect members finally burst into loud laughter!</p><p></p><p>"Hahaha haha haha...!"</p><p></p><p>"Elder, your arm!!"</p><p>"Steward, your leg!!"</p><p>"We... Ah!!"</p><p></p><p>Suddenly, the laughter of the Daoyan Sect members abruptly stopped. They looked at each other with pale faces, their expressions turning to terror, their pupils contracting to pinpoints.</p><p></p><p>Their body parts began to disintegrate in a bizarre manner, not dissipating, but being cut into precise meat cubes that fell to the ground, as if they were being subjected to a thousand cuts.</p><p></p><p>It was an extremely bloody scene!</p><p></p><p>What terrified them the most was that they felt no pain at all.</p><p></p><p>They could only watch helplessly as they were sliced by an invisible blade, turning into meat cubes!</p><p></p><p>This sight was extremely visually shocking!</p><p></p><p>"It was you! It was you!"</p><p></p><p>Here is the full English translation of the Chinese excerpt:</p><p></p><p>"You!! What kind of sorcery did you use!!"</p><p></p><p>Suddenly, the elder of the Daoyan Sect raised his head and stared at Lu Changsheng, shouting in alarm.</p><p></p><p>"Gulp..."</p><p></p><p>Old Xu swallowed hard, looking at the terrifying scene before him with horror and despair!</p><p></p><p>His stomach was churning, his heart was trembling, his mind was shaking!</p><p></p><p>Old Xu's legs were shaking uncontrollably, and he finally collapsed backwards onto the ground. He dared not look anymore, his gaze stiffly moving to the calm figure in blue, his lips frantically trembling!</p><p></p><p>He was scared, truly scared!!</p><p></p><p>Lu Changsheng stood with his hands behind his back, his expression calm and unperturbed by the elder's panicked questioning.</p><p></p><p>Killing the fish to repay the debt, reasonable.</p><p></p><p>Soon, half the bodies of the Daoyan Sect group were cut apart, and they were completely terrified!</p><p></p><p>An unprecedented great fear permeated their hearts and souls!</p><p></p><p>"Gr-great one! Spare us!! We were blind and ignorant!!"</p><p></p><p>The Daoyan Sect elder collapsed, howling.</p><p></p><p>"Great one, please spare us!"</p><p></p><p>"Great one... spare us!! We know... we were wrong!! We shouldn't have bullied this kind old gentleman!"</p><p></p><p>"Ahhhhh!!"</p><p></p><p>"......"</p><p></p><p>The others also trembled in fear and cried out.</p><p></p><p>They also understood that this powerful man in blue was standing up for the old man!</p><p></p><p>How could it be just for a single fish, a huge joke!!</p><p></p><p>This man in blue was too terrifying, the most terrifying person they had ever seen in their lives. Without even moving a muscle, he could just casually toy with them and slaughter them at will!!</p><p></p><p>"Hehe."</p><p></p><p>Lu Changsheng chuckled lightly, summoning a chair and sitting down leisurely, his fingers interlocked as he calmly watched the hell unfolding before him.</p><p></p><p>As if he was not the instigator, but merely a bystander.</p><p></p><p>This scene completely crushed the Daoyan Sect group's hopes!</p><p></p><p>They regretted, deeply regretted!</p><p></p><p>At this point, knowing it was irreversible, they could have cursed and vented their anger in a final frenzy.</p><p></p><p>But they despairingly discovered that facing the overwhelming aura of the man in blue, they didn't even dare to curse!</p><p></p><p>They even developed a morbid sense of pleasure, as if they were mere insects, deserving to be trampled upon! To be trampled by the man in blue was their honor!</p><p></p><p>"Wuwuwu......"</p><p></p><p>The process did not last long,</p><p></p><p>accompanied by the fading sound of whimpers, the Daoyan Sect group was all cut into meat bits, piled there, emanating a dense bloody stench!</p><p></p><p>"Ugh!!!"</p><p></p><p>Old Xu finally couldn't endure it anymore, collapsing to the ground and vomiting frantically!</p><p></p><p>Lu Changsheng pursed his lips, summoning the fish that had been pierced and disemboweled to his hand, softly saying, "Little fish, I've avenged you."</p><p></p><p>The fish seemed to have a final flicker of life, its tail fin twitching slightly before becoming still.</p><p></p><p>Lu Changsheng smiled slightly, casually tossing the freshly deceased fish into the nearby net.</p><p></p><p>This big fish had died a tragic death, so he could just bring it back and have Old Xu cook it, letting it release its remaining heat, hmm, with some scallions added.</p><p></p><p>"Old Xu, keep fishing."</p><p></p><p>Lu Changsheng glanced at the still vomiting Old Xu and said.</p><p></p><p>Old Xu continued vomiting, only waving his hand frantically, indicating he didn't want to fish anymore, he had no mood for it now!</p><p></p><p>Lu Changsheng frowned slightly, indifferently saying, "No, you must fish. After all, it's past mealtime now, and you won't have much business back home."</p><p></p><p>"Didn't I prepare all those fresh baits for nothing?"</p><p></p><p>Old Xu stiffened, wiping the remaining vomit from the corner of his mouth, and turned to look at Lu Changsheng with a dazed expression.</p><p></p><p>What fresh baits?</p><p></p><p>Lu Changsheng nodded towards the pile of meat bits, casually smiling and saying:</p><p></p><p>"Old Xu, have you never tried using human flesh as bait for fishing? It's very effective in attracting fish."</p><p></p><p>Huh?!</p><p></p><p>Old Xu was immediately scared out of his wits, his eyes rolling back as he finally succumbed to the overwhelming shock and fainted.</p><p></p><p>Lu Changsheng sighed helplessly, nudging Old Xu with his foot and seeing him lie there like a dead pig, then simply left him alone and went back to the lake to continue fishing.</p>

        <h1>Chapter 319</h1>
        <div class="content">
            <p>Here is my translation of the Chinese excerpt you provided:</p><p></p><p>Blood Demon Moon was very anxious at the moment. </p><p></p><p>She clearly knew that she had previously been controlled by the young man in front of her, and she had also witnessed him destroy the Ancient Wasteland Sword Clan.</p><p></p><p>But now, the young man had released his control over her.</p><p></p><p>At this moment, Blood Demon Moon's absolute obedience and reverence towards Lu Changsheng that came with the control had disappeared.</p><p></p><p>Lu Changsheng looked at Blood Demon Moon and said meaningfully, "Go back to your tribe."</p><p></p><p>Blood Demon Moon's body trembled, not expecting this young man to be willing to let her go. She quickly bowed and said, "Thank you, senior!"</p><p></p><p>With that, she turned and took a step, disappearing.</p><p></p><p>"Sir, are you just letting her go like that?" Li Shuyan asked respectfully.</p><p></p><p>Lu Changsheng said softly, "If she runs and hides, so be it. But if she returns to the Ancient Moon Blood Clan, then we'll destroy them together."</p><p></p><p>Li Shuyan's eyes narrowed, and he said no more.</p><p></p><p>Suddenly, there was an even greater commotion from the heavens above, and dazzling light rippled out like waves.</p><p></p><p>Li Shuyan looked up and saw the space itself trembling.</p><p></p><p>If it weren't for the Dao Source strenuously stabilizing the Eternal Celestial Realm's space, it would have already shattered.</p><p></p><p>"Let them fight it out. When they've had enough, I'll go clean up the aftermath. Shuyan, bring over a chair and let's have a drink."</p><p></p><p>Lu Changsheng said leisurely.</p><p></p><p>"Yes, sir," Li Shuyan quickly waved his hand, and a table and chair appeared.</p><p></p><p>Here is the full English translation of the Chinese excerpt:</p><p></p><p>After all, the source of the Heavenly Dao in the Ancestral Celestial Divine Realm had been crushed by Lu Changsheng, while the source of the Heavenly Dao in the Eternal Vast Realm was still intact, and it could still control it for the time being.</p><p></p><p>However, in the midst of this turmoil, the living beings of the Eternal Vast Realm were like small boats in the vast sea, and they could capsize and drown at any moment.</p><p></p><p>"Hum, hum, hum!"</p><p></p><p>The power of the Heavenly Dao was like thunderbolts, instantly falling upon the ancient clan powerhouses. They suddenly coughed up fresh blood and knelt in mid-air.</p><p></p><p>The expressions of the ancient clan powerhouses had finally changed. This terrifying power of the Heavenly Dao was something they had never seen before in their lives, and they felt a sense of inability to resist it pressing down on them!</p><p></p><p>"Today, I will let you ancient clan members understand what a gap is. We, the Heavenly Dao, are the maintainers of the void order, and you void living beings are not even comparable to us!"</p><p></p><p>"The Heavenly Dao reigns supreme over all things!"</p><p></p><p>...</p><p></p><p>"What a Heavenly Dao that reigns supreme over all things."</p><p></p><p>Lu Changsheng took a sip of wine and put down the cup, sneering disdainfully.</p><p></p><p>Li Shuyan smiled awkwardly and picked up the wine jar to refill Lu Changsheng's cup. "What you said is absolutely right, Master. The Heavenly Dao is nothing, it's just a matter of a single sword for you."</p><p></p><p>Lu Changsheng raised his eyebrows and looked at Li Shuyan for a while without saying a word.</p><p></p><p>Li Shuyan was terrified by Lu Changsheng's gaze and hurriedly stood up, then sat down, then stood up again, not knowing whether to stand or sit.</p><p></p><p>"Shuyan, sometimes I feel that Jinguan is better than Li Shuyan," Lu Changsheng said mysteriously.</p><p></p><p>Li Shuyan was at a loss for words and carefully asked, "Master, may I know why?"</p><p></p><p>"Your flattery is too stiff and unnatural."</p><p></p><p>Li Shuyan: "..."</p><p></p><p>...</p><p></p><p>The space in the heavens and earth continued to shatter and fall, and the might of the Heavenly Dao was in a state of panic.</p><p></p><p>At this moment, living beings were dying in every corner of the Eternal Vast Realm.</p><p></p><p>In the sky, the ancient clan powerhouses were suppressed in place, struggling to resist the power of the Heavenly Dao.</p><p></p><p>Today, they had a new understanding of the Heavenly Dao. These two Heavenly Dao Lords... were too powerful.</p><p></p><p>With their divine realm cultivation, they were simply not enough to defeat them.</p><p></p><p>"Hehe, haven't you summoned your Ancestors yet?" one of the Heavenly Dao Lords said coldly, but he was actually a little anxious in his heart. If he continued to emanate the power of the Heavenly Dao, the damage to the Eternal Vast Realm would become more and more severe.</p><p></p><p>"If you don't summon your Ancestors soon, we'll have to annihilate you ancient clan members..." the other Heavenly Dao Lord also said.</p><p></p><p>In fact, they only dared to suppress them and did not dare to annihilate these ancient clan powerhouses! Because to achieve annihilation, they would have to release even stronger Heavenly Dao power, which they could do, but the Eternal Vast Realm would not be able to withstand it.</p><p></p><p>"Damn it!"</p><p></p><p>A powerful member of the Void Ancient Beast Clan let out an unwilling roar, "You all stop hiding and just summon your Ancestors!"</p><p></p><p>As he spoke, he was the first to take out an Ancestral Seal and crush it with his hand.</p><p></p><p>Seeing this, the clan leaders of the other six clans also took out their Ancestral Seals and crushed them at the same time.</p><p></p><p>The Ancestral Seals could only be used once, and now was the time to use them!</p><p></p><p>"Blazing Wolf Clan, summon the Ancestor!"</p><p>"Ancient Moon Blood Clan, summon the Ancestor!"</p><p>"Heavenly Demon..."</p><p>"..."</p><p></p><p>One after another, the shouts echoed.</p><p></p><p>In the sky, just like that day when the Sword Immortal Clan summoned their Ancestor, countless particles appeared and gradually condensed into seven figures...</p><p></p><p>The two Heavenly Dao Lords also became grave at this moment.</p><p></p><p>At the same time,</p><p></p><p>Lu Changsheng also slowly rose from the rocking chair and looked up.</p><p></p><p>Except for the previous Jian Wuhuai, of the seven Ancestors summoned by the ancient clans this time, only two belonged to the Human Clan.</p><p></p><p>If there were no accidents, these were all from the Divine-Demonic Battlefield.</p>

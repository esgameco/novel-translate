        <h1>Chapter 246</h1>
        <div class="content">
            <p>Here is my translation of the Chinese excerpt:</p><p></p><p>"Don't delay, let's depart immediately!" </p><p></p><p>The old turtle shouted in a low voice. </p><p></p><p>Chu Lingxian and the four of them responded solemnly. They vaguely sensed that many powerful auras were approaching the place where they were.</p><p></p><p>The old turtle glanced back, a mocking expression on his face. "Let's go!"</p><p></p><p>He then strode into the rift in the void, disappearing from the scene along with Chu Lingxian and the others.</p><p></p><p>After the time it takes to drink a cup of tea.</p><p></p><p>Many rifts in the void opened up.</p><p></p><p>Numerous figures emerged from the various rifts.</p><p></p><p>Leading them was the elder swordsman Lin Chuan!</p><p></p><p>Seeing the empty space, the group showed no surprise. Those five fellows must have fled long ago, there was no way they would have waited here to die.</p><p></p><p>Inevitably, someone respectfully looked towards the leading Lin Chuan.</p><p></p><p>"Swordmaster, what do we do now?"</p><p></p><p>Lin Chuan sighed helplessly, a battered compass appearing in his hand.</p><p></p><p>He had already used it once, only two more chances to lock on remained. Each lock-on could be maintained for a decent amount of time, but not too long.</p><p></p><p>If they failed to catch those fellows in the next two tries, it would be very difficult to find them again in the future.</p><p></p><p>At this moment, he had to use it. Lin Chuan had a strong premonition that those fellows had fled out of the Heavenly Saint Realm, after all they were currently at the edge of the Heavenly Saint Realm.</p><p></p><p>But they might also have returned to another location within the Heavenly Saint Realm.</p><p></p><p>To prevent those fellows from slipping away, he had to use the compass's second chance.</p><p></p><p>With that, Lin Chuan raised two fingers, carving a light seal in the void.</p><p></p><p>The carved light seal resembled a turtle.</p><p></p><p>He then slapped the light seal into the compass.</p><p></p><p>Immediately, the compass began to tremble, its pointer spinning madly.</p><p></p><p>The next moment, the pointer abruptly stopped, pointing firmly in a certain direction.</p><p></p><p>Lin Chuan's eyelids slightly lifted, his gaze fixed intently on that direction.</p><p></p><p>Just as the Immortal Emperor had anticipated.</p><p></p><p>Those fellows... with nowhere else to go, wanted to go to the Divine Emperor's Palace!</p><p></p><p>He recalled the recent message from the Divine Emperor's Palace's Xing Shou, his expression growing slightly solemn.</p><p></p><p>The others also understood now, those fellows were fleeing to the Primordial Divine Realm.</p><p></p><p>Without further delay, Lin Chuan's cold shout rang out:</p><p></p><p>"Everyone, follow this Swordmaster to the Primordial Divine Realm!"</p><p></p><p>"Yes, sir!"</p><p></p><p>The next moment, the group surged into the void rift, disappearing from sight.</p><p></p><p>...</p><p></p><p>In the Crimson Celestial Realm.</p><p></p><p>High in the sky, the majestic and grand Resplendent Imperial Palace stretched for tens of thousands of miles.</p><p></p><p>This was the Divine Emperor's Palace, the supreme ruler governing the Six Great Divine Realms, the palace of the Ancestral Heavenly Divine Emperor.</p><p></p><p>At this time, in one of the palace's side halls.</p><p></p><p>A man in black armor sat cross-legged on a meditation cushion, but he was not cultivating.</p><p></p><p>Instead, he was frowning, as if pondering something.</p><p></p><p>This man in black armor was Xing Tian.</p><p></p><p>Since his return from the Heavenly Scar, he had been inquiring about the small world of the Spiritual Dust Realm.</p><p></p><p>There were two reasons for this: first, this was the place where his daughter had once traversed a myriad of tribulations; second, this was the world that the profound Senior Lu had once visited.</p><p></p><p>Small worlds like the Spiritual Dust Realm were countless in number, and finding one would be an extremely difficult task.</p><p></p><p>But who was he? He was the primary guardian of the Divine Emperor's Palace in the Ancestral Heavenly Divine Realm, a position of great power and status. Locating such a small world would be a trivial matter for him.</p><p></p><p>It didn't take long before he found the Spiritual Dust Realm.</p><p></p><p>He manifested a wisp of consciousness to leave the Ancestral Realm, pleading with the Dao of the Four Divine Realms for a long time, but to no avail.</p><p></p><p>The Dao of the Four Divine Realms simply would not allow him to enter the Four Divine Realms.</p><p></p><p>He knew the meaning behind the Four Divine Realms' Dao - they were afraid that his entry would disrupt the balance.</p><p></p><p>But he had a reason that compelled him to enter the Four Divine Realms, for the Spiritual Dust Realm was a subordinate world of the Four Divine Realms.</p><p></p><p>Here is the full English translation of the Chinese excerpt:</p><p></p><p>To enter the Spiritual Dust Realm, one must first pass through the Four Directions Immortal Realms.</p><p></p><p>He repeatedly assured himself that he would not cause any trouble in the Four Directions Immortal Realms, and eventually told the Dao of the Four Directions Immortal Realms his true purpose.</p><p></p><p>Heh!</p><p></p><p>Before he told them, the Dao of the Four Directions Immortal Realms had flatly refused, but after he mentioned Senior Lu, the Dao's attitude did a complete 180-degree turn.</p><p></p><p>And after the Dao of the Four Directions Immortal Realms had lifted his restraints, it simply vanished without a word.</p><p></p><p>From that moment on, Xing Tian realized that Senior Lu might be even more extraordinary than he had imagined.</p><p></p><p>This person actually made the Dao itself wary of him!</p><p></p><p>Xing Tian suspected that even his own supreme leader, the Ancestor Heavenly God Emperor, might not be able to enter the Four Directions Immortal Realms without the Dao's permission.</p><p></p><p>After obtaining the consent of the Dao of the Four Directions Immortal Realms, Xing Tian easily slipped into the Four Directions Immortal Realms and found the Spiritual Dust Realm in the lower world, entering it.</p><p></p><p>Unfortunately, with the passage of time, the Spiritual Dust Realm had long since changed, and there were no clues left.</p><p></p><p>Helpless, he had to return to the Four Directions Immortal Realms, where he finally heard the name of Lu Changsheng!</p><p></p><p>After some inquiries, he also learned that Senior Lu had once been an Immortal Emperor in this realm and had good relations with the other Immortal Emperors as well.</p><p></p><p>Just as he was about to continue his inquiries, the Dao of the Four Directions Immortal Realms told him that he could leave. If he did not leave the Four Directions Immortal Realms, the Dao's power would be used to deliver a devastating blow to his wisp of consciousness.</p><p></p><p>Alarmed, Xing Tian immediately fled.</p><p></p><p>After his consciousness returned to the Ancestor Heavenly Realm, Xing Tian calculated the time and wondered why the Immortal Emperors of the Four Directions Immortal Realms had not yet ascended, so he inquired with the Wutian Godking of the Heavenly Saint Divine Realm.</p><p></p><p>Both the Heavenly Scar and Huo Xitong had received grace from Senior Lu, so he thought he could help those Immortal Emperors a little.</p><p></p><p>Ah, but there was still a thousand years to go, a thousand years would be a thousand years.</p><p></p><p>...</p><p></p><p>In the Taichu Divine Realm, in the Cangdao Domain, in the Yanwu Town,</p><p></p><p>Outside the town, a barefoot old monk stood, wearing a tattered robe and leaning on a metal staff.</p><p></p><p>His old eyes calmly gazed at the town's signboard.</p><p></p><p>In recent days, there had been news of someone passing the Immortal Emperor tribulation in this remote area, and he had been drawn here by this.</p><p></p><p>But alas, by the time he arrived, the news had already gone cold.</p><p></p><p>After a moment, the old monk moved his bare feet and walked into the town.</p><p></p><p>On the streets,</p><p></p><p>The townspeople watched the calm-stepping old monk with curiosity.</p><p></p><p>Today, a monk had actually come to their Yanwu Town, which was a first.</p><p></p><p>Monks were not a common sight, and they would only occasionally see them when they went to other towns for medical treatment.</p><p></p><p>And this old monk was different from the young novices they had seen before - he had a cultivated aura about him, clearly a high-level enlightened monk.</p><p></p><p>Had their Yanwu Town stirred up a nest of cultivators? Ever since that Doctor Lu came to the town, the townspeople had noticed more and more cultivators appearing in their small town.</p><p></p><p>And the fact that Doctor Lu himself was also a cultivator was no longer a secret among the townspeople - everyone knew about it.</p><p></p><p>At the same time,</p><p></p><p>Although the old monk's expression was calm, he was actually a bit unsettled in his heart.</p><p></p><p>Because he discovered that the townspeople he encountered, one by one, actually had a trace of fortune surrounding them?</p><p></p><p>It was not unusual for there to be ordinary people with fortune surrounding them among the masses.</p><p></p><p>But in this small town, every single person had fortune surrounding them - this was rather rare and even eerie.</p><p></p><p>In such a remote place, for this to happen, there could only be three possible reasons:</p><p></p><p>One, this place was protected by a supreme treasure.</p><p>Two, this place was a blessed land.</p><p>Three, the fortune surrounding these townspeople was forcibly imposed on them by the influence of a powerful being.</p>

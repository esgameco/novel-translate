        <h1>Chapter 172</h1>
        <div class="content">
            <p>Here is the full English translation of the Chinese excerpt:</p><p></p><p>"Hehe. üíî‚ô§6‚ûà‚ìàùî•ùî≤ùï©.·ëï‡πè‚ìúüç©‚ôó"</p><p></p><p>Lu Changsheng chuckled and walked towards the tavern with his hands behind his back.</p><p></p><p>Xing Tian stood up, tilting his head to look towards the horizon outside Qingxuan Town, a trace of disdain flashing in his eyes.</p><p></p><p>Three Seven-Revolving Immortal Emperor realm cultivators, mere chickens and dogs.</p><p></p><p>Immediately, his figure moved and disappeared from the courtyard.</p><p></p><p>...</p><p></p><p>Outside Qingxuan Town.</p><p></p><p>Many cultivators with relatively strong cultivation bases suddenly looked towards the horizon, their gazes turning grave for a moment, then suddenly filled with excitement.</p><p></p><p>"There are three extremely powerful auras heading towards Qingxuan Town, it's very likely that people from the Jiang Clan Imperial Clan have arrived!!"</p><p></p><p>Accompanying an exclamation from an unknown source, both inside and outside Qingxuan Town suddenly became restless.</p><p></p><p>Countless cultivators soared into the sky, occupying good positions, excitedly looking towards the horizon.</p><p></p><p>Most of them came from other places in the Black Sha Domain, and some even came from outside the Black Sha Domain. What were they waiting for in Qingxuan Town for nearly half a month? Wasn't it just for this day?</p><p></p><p>This day has finally arrived!</p><p></p><p>Outside the Longevity Tavern,</p><p></p><p>The queuing cultivators became nervous. The Jiang Clan Imperial Clan has arrived, they will definitely come to the Longevity Tavern, will they be affected as well?</p><p></p><p>Recalling the previous incident, some of the queuing cultivators were mysteriously killed, which was too unjust.</p><p></p><p>Casting a resentful gaze towards the horizon, Left Chou Shan Chou said in a deep voice, "Everyone, don't panic, the Proprietor has it under control. If you are truly afraid, then you can leave first."</p><p></p><p>Hearing this, some customers who trusted Lu Changsheng gritted their teeth and still stood in line.</p><p></p><p>It was finally their turn, if they left now, they wouldn't know when they could drink the wine again.</p><p></p><p>Some who were not as addicted to alcohol hurriedly left. Even though they trusted Lu Changsheng, they didn't dare to risk their lives for a sip of wine.</p><p></p><p>At this moment, Peng Fang slowly approached Left Chou Shan Chou and said, "The Jiang Clan Imperial Clan is really going all out this time, directly sending three Seven-Revolving Immortal Emperor realm cultivators. If my guess is correct, they should be the Wind, Fire, and Thunder Envoys of their clan."</p><p></p><p>Wind, Fire, and Thunder Envoys?</p><p></p><p>Left Chou Shan Chou's pupils shrank violently.</p><p></p><p>He originally thought that the Jiang Clan Imperial Clan would only send a Five-Revolving Immortal Emperor, but who would have thought that they would directly send the Wind, Fire, and Thunder Envoys.</p><p></p><p>Shameless, aren't they?</p><p></p><p>Peng Fang's eyes flashed, and he whispered, "When they arrive, you just maintain order, the rest will be handled by me."</p><p></p><p>Hearing this, Left Chou Shan Chou trembled again, looking at the fat man beside him with disbelief. His gaze gradually turned bitter, as he had always considered himself the strongest in Qingxuan Town...</p><p></p><p>He underestimated, or rather, they all underestimated. The Proprietor and this fat man are both so powerful, yet they still come to this Qingxuan Town, isn't this just bullying the weak?</p><p></p><p>Incomprehensible, truly incomprehensible.</p><p></p><p>"Then, I'll leave it to the senior," Left Chou Shan Chou said respectfully.</p><p></p><p>Peng Fang sneered, "If there was no Proprietor backing me up, I would still be wary of the Jiang Clan Imperial Clan to some extent. But with the Proprietor's support, the Jiang Clan Imperial Clan... is nothing."</p><p></p><p>Ignoring Left Chou Shan Chou's dumbfounded expression, Peng Fang suddenly smiled sideways and said, "By the way, you little guy are only a Seven-Revolving Immortal Emperor, yet you actually have grievances with the Jiang Clan Imperial Clan. Tell me about it."</p><p></p><p>Left Chou Shan Chou pursed his lips and gloomily recounted his past grievances with the Jiang Clan Imperial Clan.</p><p></p><p>Peng Fang listened with great relish, occasionally praising Left Chou Shan Chou.</p><p></p><p>"Senior, that's the gist of my grievances with the Jiang Clan Imperial Clan," Left Chou Shan Chou said through gritted teeth.</p><p></p><p>If his strength allowed it, he really wanted to tear Jiang Taiqi apart!</p><p></p><p>"You little guy, I didn't expect this..." Peng Fang exclaimed in surprise.</p><p></p><p>Here is the full English translation of the Chinese excerpt:</p><p></p><p>Lao Chou Shan looked at him disdainfully and said, "He doesn't look that impressive, yet he was able to get close to the daughter of the God Clan. Could it be that he has some hidden talents?"</p><p></p><p>Lao Chou Shan bitterly smiled and said, "Senior, please don't tease me."</p><p></p><p>Peng Fang chuckled and said, "This can also be considered a disgraceful matter for the Jiang Clan's Imperial Clan. No wonder they are trying their best to kill you. If this matter were to be exposed, it would be a huge blow to the Jiang Clan's reputation."</p><p></p><p>Lao Chou Shan nodded noncommittally. </p><p></p><p>In truth, he really wanted to expose this matter, but given his strength, status and position... whether others would believe it or not, his and his daughter's situation would become extremely dangerous.</p><p></p><p>"If there's a chance later, how about I help you expose this matter?" Peng Fang said with a smile.</p><p></p><p>Lao Chou Shan paused, he knew his own words might not carry much weight, but when this matter was spoken by a Xian Emperor like Peng Fang, it would carry a lot of credibility. So he quickly nodded and said, "Thank you, Senior. But won't you be afraid of retaliation from the Jiang Clan?"</p><p></p><p>"Retaliation? In the past, I might have been a little wary, but with the Boss backing me up, I'm not afraid of a damn thing," Peng Fang chuckled and continued, "When I publicize this matter, I'll need you to come out and testify. Don't be a coward then."</p><p></p><p>Lao Chou Shan's eyes hardened as he solemnly nodded, "Senior, don't worry. At this point, I won't be hesitant anymore!"</p><p></p><p>Now that the Long Sheng Tavern and the Jiang Clan were in full confrontation, if he had to rely on himself to take revenge, it would be a distant dream. </p><p></p><p>This was a rare opportunity, he must cling tightly to the Boss's thigh.</p><p></p><p>"Mm." Peng Fang nodded in satisfaction, then raised his brow and looked up at the sky, "The three turds are here."</p><p></p><p>Sure enough, </p><p></p><p>the next moment, three figures suddenly appeared in the sky above Qingxuan Town!</p><p></p><p>Accompanying them was the immediate commotion in Qingxuan Town.</p><p></p><p>"The Jiang Clan is here!"</p><p></p><p>"Looks like it's the Wind, Fire and Thunder Three Envoys of the Jiang Clan... Oh my god!"</p><p></p><p>"The Jiang Clan is really going all out! I thought sending a Xian Emperor at the Five Transformation realm would be the limit, but who would have thought..."</p><p></p><p>"The Long Sheng Tavern is in trouble this time."</p><p></p><p>"Sending the Wind, Fire and Thunder Three Envoys to target a small tavern, the Jiang Clan must have lost all face."</p><p></p><p>"Shh, be careful with your words..."</p><p></p><p>In the sky,</p><p></p><p>the Wind, Fire and Thunder Three Envoys swept their gaze across Qingxuan Town, seeing the countless figures below, their eyes flashed slightly, indeed, just as they had expected, there were too many onlookers.</p><p></p><p>Soon, they also saw the two heads of Jiang Chu and Jiang Chong hanging on the town gate below...</p><p></p><p>A fierce look flashed in their eyes, the Jiang Clan had really disgraced themselves this time.</p><p></p><p>The Wind Envoy waved his hand towards the below,</p><p></p><p>the two heads on the town gate detached and flew up towards him, he casually swept his sleeve to collect the two heads, then said:</p><p></p><p>"Thunder Envoy, Fire Envoy, let's just raze that tavern."</p><p></p><p>They didn't even need to inquire about it in this place, with just a slight sensing, they could feel the location of the Long Sheng Tavern.</p><p></p><p>That was where the most people gathered, with the most chaotic aura.</p><p></p><p>"Mm."</p><p></p><p>Just as the three were about to flash towards it,</p><p></p><p>a battle-hardened man in black armor suddenly appeared before them.</p><p></p><p>The Wind, Fire and Thunder Three Envoys' expressions stilled, their eyes turning grave!</p><p></p><p>This black-armored man was very strong!</p><p></p><p>The appearance of the black-armored man made everyone in this world pause in astonishment.</p><p></p><p>Xing Tian looked at the Wind, Fire and Thunder Three Envoys as if looking at the dead, he said indifferently:</p><p></p><p>"The Boss told me to deal with you three flies, are you going to surrender or shall I make you?"</p>

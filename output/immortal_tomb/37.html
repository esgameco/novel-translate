        <h1>Chapter 37</h1>
        <div class="content">
            <p>Here is the full English translation of the Chinese excerpt:</p><p></p><p>Just as the two sides were arguing fiercely, with spittle flying everywhere, </p><p></p><p>Zhao Shenyuan suddenly stood up and coldly shouted, "Enough!!"</p><p></p><p>The scene immediately quieted down. The four Demon Kings reluctantly sat down, and the five Demon Princes also snorted disdainfully and sat down, looking up at the ceiling.</p><p></p><p>Zhao Shenyuan took a deep breath and swept his gaze over them, speaking in a stern voice, </p><p></p><p>"Now that the Demon and Demon Beast realms have formed an alliance, we are all allies. Why do you Demon Princes have to insult our Demon Realm like this?"</p><p></p><p>Li Tengse's snake-like eyes flashed as he smiled, "What? Can't we even speak up?"</p><p></p><p>"Hehe..." The other four Demon Princes also shook their heads mockingly.</p><p></p><p>Seeing this, the four Demon Kings beside Zhao Shenyuan's face changed slightly, about to break out in curses.</p><p></p><p>At this moment, the veins on Zhao Shenyuan's neck bulged as he growled, </p><p></p><p>"You Demon Realm need not say these things. If you can conquer the eastern part of the Lishui region, I, Zhao Shenyuan, will admit that you are better than us!! Do you dare?"</p><p></p><p>Slap!!!</p><p></p><p>Li Tengse slammed the table and stood up, sneering at Zhao Shenyuan,</p><p></p><p>"What's there to not dare! Zhao Shenyuan, just watch. Our Demon Realm is not like your Demon Realm, only playing some underhanded tricks behind the scenes! We're leaving!"</p><p></p><p>With that, he waved his hand arrogantly, and he and the other four Demon Princes strode out of the hall.</p><p></p><p>As the five great Demon Princes left, </p><p></p><p>the unwillingness and anger on Zhao Shenyuan's face instantly disappeared, replaced by a look of triumph and mockery.</p><p></p><p>"Hehe, Shenyuan, I cooperated pretty well just now, right? I tell you, I almost couldn't hold back my laughter just now."</p><p></p><p>Chu Qingcang came over and patted Zhao Shenyuan's shoulder, chuckling.</p><p></p><p>"You... you all..." </p><p></p><p>The other three great Demon Kings looked at the rapidly changing Zhao Shenyuan and Chu Qingcang with a bewildered expression, not knowing if they were dreaming.</p><p></p><p>"Haha, you don't know, Shenyuan was deliberately provoking them!" </p><p></p><p>Chu Qingcang said proudly.</p><p></p><p>The three Demon Kings' expressions changed for a moment, then they seemed to understand the key point, and their faces soon broke into smiles as they praised,</p><p></p><p>"Demon King Shenyuan is truly the strategic mastermind of our Demon Realm."</p><p></p><p>"I've always said that the Demon Beasts are reckless, and you've seen it today, haven't you?" Zhao Shenyuan smiled and then sneered, </p><p></p><p>"Before the Demon Lord issues a full-scale attack order, our Demon Realm has already suffered two losses, though it's just a drop in the bucket, but we can't let the Demon Realm enjoy the fruits of our labor. It's just right to let these fools try it out..."</p><p></p><p>The Demon Kings all nodded.</p><p></p><p>"Shenyuan, do you think I'm smarter than the five great Demon Princes?"</p><p></p><p>At this moment, Chu Qingcang looked at Zhao Shenyuan expectantly.</p><p></p><p>Zhao Shenyuan glanced at him and the corner of his mouth curled up, "About the same."</p><p></p><p>Chu Qingcang's face stiffened, and a trace of anger slowly crept up.</p><p></p><p>Zhao Shenyuan's eyebrows twitched slightly, then he quickly stepped back and disappeared from the hall.</p><p></p><p>"Damn you, Zhao Shenyuan!!"</p><p></p><p>Chu Qingcang's face flushed red as he roared and punched the spot where Zhao Shenyuan had just stood!</p><p></p><p>Boom!!</p><p></p><p>Demonic energy surged, sweeping up all the objects in the hall.</p><p></p><p>The next moment, a large hole appeared in the hall wall, and through the hole, one could even see a few patrolling demon beasts who had been blasted to pieces by Chu Qingcang's punch.</p><p></p><p>"Chu... Chu Qingcang, what are you going crazy for! This is the grand hall where the Demon Lord receives guests... You actually punched a hole in it!"</p><p></p><p>The three Demon Kings looked at Chu Qingcang in horror.</p><p></p><p>"Huh?"</p><p></p><p>Chu Qingcang suddenly startled, as if he had been doused with a bucket of cold water, from head to toe.</p><p></p><p>It's over, it's over!</p><p></p><p>Here is the full English translation of the Chinese excerpt:</p><p></p><p>Midnight.</p><p></p><p>The immortal tomb in the mountain range.</p><p></p><p>This place was quiet as usual.</p><p></p><p>Suddenly, a figure of unparalleled grace appeared here.</p><p></p><p>She was dressed in a black floor-length gown, with her long hair cascading down to her waist, and a black veil mask covering her face, making her features indistinguishable.</p><p></p><p>Only her eyes were visible, like icy blades cleaving through mountains, cold to the extreme.</p><p></p><p>The woman stepped forward, slowly approaching the cluster of tombs, scanning the area and murmuring, "It's been a while since I've come. When the time is ripe, I must uncover your secrets."</p><p></p><p>But soon, her gaze changed, and her figure abruptly appeared near the center of the tomb cluster.</p><p></p><p>She looked at the empty space before her, motionless like a sculpture, only her pupils constricting tightly!</p><p></p><p>"There was a tomb here before..." </p><p></p><p>But there was nothing in front of her now.</p><p></p><p>She did not think she had remembered incorrectly, </p><p></p><p>for she clearly recalled that there had been a tomb here before!!</p><p></p><p>But this time, that tomb had mysteriously disappeared, leaving no trace behind.</p><p></p><p>"How is this possible? What has happened..."</p><p></p><p>The woman muttered in a daze, took a deep breath, closed her eyes, and slowly vanished.</p><p></p><p>...</p><p></p><p>Midday.</p><p></p><p>The group led by Gu Helin once again arrived at Moyu Town.</p><p></p><p>Of course, this time it was only Gu Helin, the Second Elder, and a group of Foundation Establishment disciples.</p><p></p><p>Shen Miaojun had previously told Gu Helin and the Second Elder that she needed to return to the sect and would send some more disciples and elders down the mountain later.</p><p></p><p>Gu Helin and the Second Elder agreed, acknowledging that the sect master's decision was reasonable.</p><p></p><p>But they knew in their hearts that the sect master was likely too afraid and ashamed to face Lu Changsheng, which was why she had temporarily returned to the sect.</p><p></p><p>Otherwise, it would have just been a simple talisman message, not such a complicated affair.</p><p></p><p>In the backyard of the Town Lord's mansion.</p><p></p><p>Gu Helin, the Second Elder, and Tong Xin stood respectfully before Lu Changsheng.</p><p></p><p>"You've arrived just in time. I actually have a task for you to handle," Lu Changsheng said with a gentle smile.</p><p></p><p>This smile left the Second Elder dumbfounded, for the senior had not been like this the night the sect master was reprimanded.</p><p></p><p>"Senior, you honor us," Gu Helin hurriedly waved his hands, chuckling awkwardly. "Please just give us your instructions. Whatever is within our abilities, you can rest assured, senior."</p><p></p><p>His respect for the man before him was not only due to Lu Changsheng's status as a Transcendental Immortal Venerable, but more importantly, because of how he had been moved that night when the demonic snake had attacked Moyu Town.</p><p></p><p>Lu Changsheng nodded in satisfaction, then smiled and said, "Please, have a seat. No need to be so formal."</p><p></p><p>"Ah, yes." </p><p></p><p>Gu Helin and the Second Elder then sat down.</p><p></p><p>Tong Xin, of course, did not dare to sit, and stood obediently to the side, his gaze occasionally and nervously glancing at the Abyss Demon Spear, full of awe.</p><p></p><p>At this moment, the sound of footsteps approached.</p><p></p><p>The three were puzzled to see a young man hurriedly rushing in.</p><p></p><p>"Sir, you summoned me," the young man, Lin Dong, respectfully bowed before Lu Changsheng, ignoring the presence of Gu Helin and the others.</p><p></p><p>Lu Changsheng studied Lin Dong for a moment and said warmly, "Good, it's been a few days. You look cleaner and more robust now, it seems the Town Lord's mansion has been treating you well."</p><p></p><p>Lin Dong gave an embarrassed smile.</p><p></p><p>Lu Changsheng then turned to Gu Helin and asked, "What do you think of this young man?"</p><p></p><p>Gu Helin's body stiffened, for he understood Lu Changsheng's intent. He intently studied Lin Dong, carefully examining him.</p><p></p><p>Under this captivating gaze, Lin Dong couldn't help but grow nervous.</p>

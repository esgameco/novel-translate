        <h1>Chapter 431</h1>
        <div class="content">
            <p>Here is my translation of the Chinese excerpt:</p><p></p><p>After regaining her composure, Kening naturally averted her gaze, then slowly stood up from the ground, looking down at her toes and saying, "I, I am Kening from the Weiyuan Pavilion."</p><p></p><p>Lu Changsheng stood there with his hands behind his back, his expression unchanged, waiting for the young lady before him to continue.</p><p></p><p>"Kening was in the Weiyuan Pavilion when she inadvertently heard the sound of a guqin. She then hurried towards the Guantian Pavilion, and finally, by some strange twist of fate, climbed up to this Guantian Pavilion..."</p><p></p><p>After explaining the reason, Kening gave a slight bow: "Sir, Kening did not mean to intrude."</p><p></p><p>Lu Changsheng naturally would not make an issue of it, and after nodding slightly, he did not wish to say anything further. He then stepped forward, passing by Kening, and left the Guantian Terrace.</p><p></p><p>As the footsteps gradually faded away, Kening turned around, but the man in blue robes had disappeared. She let out a soft sigh of relief, but at the same time, a sense of inexplicable loss welled up in her heart.</p><p></p><p>Suddenly, there was a sound from behind her. Kening instinctively turned around, and her eyes narrowed in disbelief at the sight before her.</p><p></p><p>The shattered fragments on the ground were mysteriously floating up and slowly coalescing... forming a door!</p><p></p><p>The door that had just been shattered into pieces was now magically reassembling itself!</p><p></p><p>Kening couldn't help but take a step closer, gently touching the door, her eyes trembling.</p><p></p><p>The reassembled door had not a single trace of damage or abnormality, and it was exactly the same as before it had been destroyed.</p><p></p><p>How was this possible...?</p><p></p><p>This was like transforming decay into wonder, no different from mending a broken mirror or resurrecting the dead.</p><p></p><p>Kening stared in awe at the terrifying sight before her, and her thoughts gradually became muddled as she recalled the man in blue robes.</p><p></p><p>Kening left the Guantian Pavilion in a daze.</p><p></p><p>As Kening left the Guantian Pavilion, the guards were dumbfounded.</p><p></p><p>What? How could Princess Kening be coming out of the Guantian Pavilion?</p><p></p><p>Could it be that she had sneaked in while they were distracted by the guqin music earlier?</p><p></p><p>The guards remembered the previous inquiry from the king, and they had confidently assured him that no one had entered. If the king were to find out about this, they would be in big trouble.</p><p></p><p>The guards were panicked and wanted to ask, but Kening didn't even notice them, lost in her own state of shock as she left.</p><p></p><p>The guards could only look at each other and sigh.</p><p></p><p>"Captain, if the king finds out about this, we're done for."</p><p></p><p>"It should be fine... The king dotes on Princess Kening, and given her personality, she won't mention this to the king. Let's just turn a blind eye to this."</p><p></p><p>"Ah, it's all because that gentleman's guqin playing was too good! If only we hadn't been distracted..."</p><p></p><p>"Don't say that kind of thing, you fool. How can you blame that gentleman? Didn't you see how much the king and the Guqin Saint admired his skills?"</p><p></p><p>"Enough, this guy can't be trusted. In the future, we should keep our distance from him, or he'll end up getting us killed."</p><p></p><p>"..."</p><p></p><p>Here is the full English translation of the Chinese excerpt:</p><p></p><p>Myriad Flowers, Myriad Flowers, it's not just talk - it's because in each and every Myriad Flowers Garden, there are truly beautiful women as numerous as the clouds, too many to count!</p><p></p><p>The rumor goes that no man can walk out of the Myriad Flowers Garden on his own two feet.</p><p></p><p>There's also a rumor that no man can sample all the flowers in the Myriad Flowers Garden, even if he devotes his entire life to it.</p><p></p><p>Because the flow of beautiful women in each Myriad Flowers Garden is extremely high, with many new fresh faces replenishing it every day.</p><p></p><p>So it's impossible to sample them all, absolutely impossible!</p><p></p><p>It's also unknown where these beautiful women come from.</p><p></p><p>When talking about the Myriad Flowers Garden, one cannot avoid mentioning its behind-the-scenes master.</p><p></p><p>To be able to establish a chain of Myriad Flowers Gardens across the entire world, you can tell that the power of the Myriad Flowers Garden's behind-the-scenes master is truly colossal.</p><p></p><p>Unfortunately, that behind-the-scenes master is very mysterious, and aside from the internal staff of the Myriad Flowers Garden, probably no one has ever seen the master in person.</p><p></p><p>For the Cloud Mist Ancient Kingdom to have a Myriad Flowers Garden is already quite an achievement, you know that the neighboring Wind Phoenix Kingdom doesn't even have one.</p><p></p><p>At this moment, in front of the gates of the Myriad Flowers Garden.</p><p></p><p>"Oh? This Myriad Flowers Garden is that impressive??"</p><p></p><p>After hearing Cloud Arrogant Evil's vivid introduction, Old Turtle stroked his beard, his eyes shining with excitement.</p><p></p><p>"Hehe, Senior Turtle, it's not just Arrogant Evil boasting - to put it bluntly, the Myriad Flowers Garden is the number one brothel in the entire world! Places like the other Love Intoxication Pavilions and Spring Pavilions, although they also have chains, are nothing compared to the Myriad Flowers Garden!"</p><p></p><p>Cloud Arrogant Evil guaranteed with a pat on his chest.</p><p></p><p>"Alright, alright! Arrogant Evil, let's go in, Grandpa Turtle's big bird is already hungry and impatient!"  Old Turtle said eagerly.</p><p></p><p>Cloud Arrogant Evil smiled smugly, "Okay then!"</p><p></p><p>With that, Cloud Arrogant Evil led Old Turtle towards the gates of the Myriad Flowers Garden.</p><p></p><p>"Oh! Your Highness the Ninth Prince! It's been a while, you've finally come, you don't know, Yumeng has been dying to see you, she's completely lost her appetite and can't sleep at all!"</p><p></p><p>The madam rushed over, giggling.</p><p></p><p>In fact, she had already seen Cloud Arrogant Evil coming, but since she saw him talking to an elder, she didn't approach to disturb them.</p><p></p><p>Old Turtle eyed the madam in front of him, his eyes narrowing slightly, the corners of his mouth curling up.</p><p></p><p>Hmm, not bad, even the madam is quite attractive, a mature beauty full of charm.</p><p></p><p>Cloud Arrogant Evil chuckled, he had no impression of who this Yumeng was, and then waved his hand, "Alright, alright, Madam, you don't need to give this Prince the usual flattering speeches, today I've come here to let this senior of mine have a good time, to enjoy himself to the fullest!"</p><p></p><p>Cloud Arrogant Evil gestured towards the old man.</p><p></p><p>The madam immediately understood, and then stepped forward naturally, linking her arm with Old Turtle's, snuggling up to him, and giggling coquettishly, "Grandpa, since the Ninth Prince has said so, then today I'll definitely make sure you have a wonderful time!"</p><p></p><p>Old Turtle was instantly flustered by the softness of the arm, but he was an old hand in this field after all, so he quickly regained control, squeezing her arm, and laughed, "Alright! Today, Grandpa Turtle wants to see what kind of tricks this Myriad Flowers Garden has up its sleeve!"</p><p></p><p>This scene was witnessed by Cloud Arrogant Evil standing to the side, and he inwardly admired, other things aside, just this move alone showed that the senior was also an old hand in this field.</p><p></p><p>"Hehehe, then Grandpa, you'll soon see that the Myriad Flowers Garden is not just known for nothing!" </p><p></p><p>The madam giggled coquettishly as she led Old Turtle and Cloud Arrogant Evil into the Myriad Flowers Garden.</p>

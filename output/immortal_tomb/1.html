        <h1>Chapter 1</h1>
        <div class="content">
            <p>Here is the full English translation of the Chinese excerpt:</p><p></p><p>The Eastern Realm, the Far East.</p><p></p><p>Many commoners were kneeling and praying devoutly towards the distant, unending mountain ridges. After their prayers, they hurriedly left, pulling their children or wives along.</p><p></p><p>They seemed to hold the mountains in awe, not daring to approach them.</p><p></p><p>As time passed, the night fell silently, the crescent moon obscured by dark clouds, making the mountains appear gloomy and ominous.</p><p></p><p>There was no wind rustling the grass, no beasts howling or insects chirping - the night sky grew increasingly quiet and eerie.</p><p></p><p>The mountains in the darkness resembled a peerless, ferocious beast, ready to devour any who dared approach.</p><p></p><p>Suddenly, a cold wind blew, making the grass and trees sway across the mountains. The dark clouds in the night sky were gradually blown apart...</p><p></p><p>The moonlight then spilled across the mountains.</p><p></p><p>The numerous white, ghostly structures within the mountains became clearer - they were row upon row of...tombs.</p><p></p><p>These ancient tombs appeared well-maintained and clean, with fresh flowers and fruits placed before each one.</p><p></p><p>Suddenly, a bizarre scene unfolded! </p><p></p><p>One of the tombs began to slowly crack and crumble. Pieces of stone tumbled down, and a pale hand abruptly emerged, grasping the broken tomb edge.</p><p></p><p>A young man then appeared, tall and composed, dressed in simple blue robes that were clean and pristine, save for his slightly disheveled raven-black hair.</p><p></p><p>He stood quietly amidst the cold, eerie tomb cluster, his eyes unblinkingly fixed on the tomb that was his own.</p><p></p><p>"Hmm? I even have a tomb, how absurd," Lu Changsheng murmured, a hint of bewilderment in his gaze, for he had no memories associated with this place.</p><p></p><p>Quickly, Lu Changsheng noticed that his tomb had no epitaph...</p><p></p><p>His eyes flickered as he looked around at the other tombs, only to find that none of them had any epitaphs either.</p><p></p><p>"None of them have epitaphs?" Lu Changsheng whispered, "Then besides me, who else is buried in all these tombs?"</p><p></p><p>Just as Lu Changsheng was about to start digging up the tombs to investigate, his brow furrowed slightly.</p><p></p><p>Two spiritual auras were approaching the mountains.</p><p></p><p>Lu Changsheng's eyes narrowed slightly, and with a light gesture, the tomb he had emerged from, as well as the scattered stones, were seamlessly erased, as if they had never been there.</p><p></p><p>At that moment, two streaks of light flashed across the mountains, materializing into two figures - an upright, immortal-like old man with a white beard, and a quietly composed young man in elegant robes.</p><p></p><p>"Master, it's almost midnight, why did you suddenly want to come to the Immortal Tombs?" the young man in robes asked, his gaze sweeping across the tomb field, only to freeze when he noticed the figure standing there.</p><p></p><p>The white-bearded old man had already seen Lu Changsheng, but he was not surprised. It was not unusual for cultivators to occasionally visit the Immortal Tombs.</p><p></p><p>"The Immortal Tombs..." Lu Changsheng murmured, his brow slightly furrowed as he looked at the old man and young man from afar.</p><p></p><p>In an instant, Lu Changsheng turned to leave, having no desire to interact with these two.</p><p></p><p>The young man in robes looked curiously at Lu Changsheng's retreating back, unsure of why he felt this cultivator was somehow...strange, though he couldn't quite put his finger on it.</p><p></p><p>At this moment, the white-bearded old man's expression changed slightly, for he had noticed that the spot where Lu Changsheng had been standing earlier seemed to have been a tomb, if he remembered the layout of the tomb field correctly. But now, it was empty and bare.</p><p></p><p>"Fellow Daoist, please wait!" the old man suddenly called out.</p><p></p><p>Lu Changsheng's steps paused, and he turned to look at the old man, waiting for him to continue.</p><p></p><p>Here is the full English translation of the Chinese excerpt:</p><p></p><p>The young man in elegant attire was somewhat taken aback, not knowing why the Venerable Master had stopped this cultivator.</p><p></p><p>Elder Gu Helin politely cupped his hands towards Lu Changsheng and smiled, "I apologize for detaining you, Fellow Daoist, but I have a matter to inquire about."</p><p></p><p>To be on the safe side, Gu Helin did not rashly probe into Lu Changsheng's aura, as those who came to this immortal tomb in the middle of the night were cultivators from all over the Spiritual Dust Cultivation World. If the other party's cultivation was profound, then his probing would easily be detected. This would be a very impolite act.</p><p></p><p>Lu Changsheng nodded slightly, indicating for him to continue.</p><p></p><p>The other party was sparing with his words, which Gu Helin was already accustomed to, as he had seen many reclusive cultivators. He then asked in a measured voice, "Fellow Daoist, the place you were just standing, I vaguely remember there seemed to be a tomb there..."</p><p></p><p>Lu Changsheng looked towards that spot and softly said, "If it's just a vague memory, then you must have remembered it wrong. There is no tomb there at all."</p><p></p><p>With that, he left the tomb area under the gaze of Gu Helin and the young man in elegant attire.</p><p></p><p>Gu Helin watched the gradually retreating figure, his gaze slightly perplexed. Could it be that he had really remembered it wrong?</p><p></p><p>He couldn't help but look again, only to see the spot was empty and completely natural, not at all like there had ever been a tomb.</p><p></p><p>Gu Helin soon shook his head and thought no more of it.</p><p></p><p>"Venerable Master, that cultivator seemed a bit strange," the young man in elegant attire frowned as he watched Lu Changsheng leave.</p><p></p><p>Gu Helin regained his composure and lightly chuckled, "Reclusive cultivators like that are common in the Cultivation World. You, having entered the Cultivation World for a short time, have simply seen too little."</p><p></p><p>The young man in elegant attire laughed awkwardly and said, "Venerable Master, you still haven't said why you suddenly came to this immortal tomb in the middle of the night."</p><p></p><p>Gu Helin's gaze faltered, and then he reverently swept his eyes over the many white tombs, murmuring, "I'm not entirely sure myself. I just suddenly felt compelled to come and take a look..."</p><p></p><p>The young man in elegant attire pouted and quietly said, "Venerable Master, what's so good about looking at an immortal tomb? There are legends in the Cultivation World that whoever can uncover the secrets of an immortal tomb can attain immortality... but these immortal tombs have existed for at least a hundred thousand years, and no cultivator has been able to uncover their secrets."</p><p></p><p>There were such rumors circulating throughout the vast Spiritual Dust Cultivation World about being able to find immortality in the immortal tombs.</p><p></p><p>At first, countless cultivators came here,</p><p></p><p>but as time passed, many cultivators had no choice but to give up on the idea of finding immortality in the immortal tombs.</p><p></p><p>They did not doubt the rumors, because in the past, many powerful cultivators had sought immortality here in vain and had long wanted to break open the immortal tombs!</p><p></p><p>But the immortal tombs were extraordinarily hard, each and every one of them.</p><p></p><p>They couldn't even budge them the slightest bit, not even able to make a dent on the surface...</p><p></p><p>Given this, if these were not immortal tombs, then what were they? Since they were immortal tombs, naturally they must hold the secrets of immortality.</p><p></p><p>They simply thought that immortality was hard to attain, for if it were so easy to find immortality, then it would not truly be immortality.</p><p></p><p>In response to the young man's words, Gu Helin suddenly shouted sternly, "Outrageous! The ignorant fear nothing! How dare you spout nonsense in front of an immortal tomb! Quickly kneel and apologize!"</p><p></p><p>Seeing Gu Helin's anger, the young man in elegant attire was startled and immediately prostrated himself, his body trembling.</p><p></p><p>He was mainly afraid of Gu Helin, not the immortal tomb itself, after all, nothing strange had ever happened at the immortal tomb, as if aside from being hard, it was no different from other tombs.</p><p></p><p>Seeing this, Gu Helin's expression softened, and he shook his head, frowning as he couldn't help but look towards that spot again.</p><p></p><p>Could it really be that he had remembered it wrong?</p><p></p><p>Meanwhile,</p><p></p><p>Lu Changsheng had already left the mountain ridge, walking quietly on the small path, his black eyes flickering slightly.</p><p></p><p>Such a peculiar matter, even he found it somewhat unsettling.</p><p></p><p>Many doubts flashed through his mind.</p><p></p><p>"The immortal tomb, just who has the ability to bury me within it..."</p><p></p><p>"What has happened?"</p>

        <h1>Chapter 68</h1>
        <div class="content">
            <p>Here is the full English translation of the Chinese excerpt:</p><p></p><p>"We have seen the senior!"</p><p></p><p>The elders were stunned for a moment, and quickly paid their respects, not daring to show the slightest disrespect. Now that the Patriarch was not in the sect, if they offended the person in front of them, the consequences could be very serious.</p><p></p><p>"No need for so many courtesies, you may rise."</p><p></p><p>Lu Changsheng said indifferently.</p><p></p><p>"Thank you, senior."</p><p></p><p>After the elders stood up, they looked at the Ancient Crane Forest, then at each other, not knowing what to say. The behavior of the Ancient Crane Forest was clearly abnormal.</p><p></p><p>After a moment of silence,</p><p></p><p>The elders, seeing that Lu Changsheng did not speak either, felt immense pressure. Then an elder gritted his teeth and stepped forward, bowing and saying,</p><p></p><p>"Senior, your true words have greatly enlightened us. Today we have specially come to bring you gifts in gratitude..."</p><p></p><p>As he spoke, the elders simultaneously raised the large and small packages in their hands, their faces showing sincere smiles.</p><p></p><p>At this time, the mind of Ancient Crane was in a daze, he was very anxious.</p><p></p><p>From the moment he met Lu Changsheng until now, Ancient Crane had deeply revered Lu Changsheng after personally experiencing his many mysterious abilities. One could say it was a reverence deeply ingrained in his bones.</p><p></p><p>Lu Changsheng lightly stepped on the old turtle, saying, "So what enlightenment did you gain from that true saying?"</p><p></p><p>"Sss." The old turtle cried in pain, his face full of agony.</p><p></p><p>He knew that Lu Changsheng was punishing him.</p><p></p><p>"Uh, Senior, you don't know, in the past my cultivation was very cautious and step-by-step, afraid of making any mistakes. Now I think that in the path of cultivation, one must take big strides, no matter what one does, one must be bold and daring. There is a chance miracles can happen, being timid and shrinking back will never amount to anything, only blending in with the masses!"</p><p></p><p>"Exactly, exactly. This true saying will also be extremely useful in future tribulations, it can be called a powerful stabilizing medicine. I believe I will definitely be able to safely pass through the lightning tribulation. In the past I was very afraid of the lightning tribulation, but now I feel it's nothing!"</p><p></p><p>"Haha, we cultivators should go against the heavens, fear nothing. Even if we fail, there is only death, but what is there to fear about death?"</p><p></p><p>Listening to the elders' heroic words, Ancient Crane's heart raced, this group of elders had gone mad.</p><p></p><p>He then looked at Lu Changsheng with some trepidation, only to find that Lu Changsheng was also looking at him, causing him to immediately lower his head in fright.</p><p></p><p>But Lu Changsheng's next words left Ancient Crane stunned.</p><p></p><p>"Mm, very good."</p><p></p><p>Hearing this, the elders beamed with joy, one by one deeply bowing to Lu Changsheng.</p><p></p><p>"However, those words were not spoken by me. Any consequences that arise have nothing to do with me, you can take your gifts back."</p><p></p><p>Lu Changsheng said, kicking the turtle shell into the nearby bushes, then turning and walking back into the courtyard.</p><p></p><p>The elders were puzzled, unable to make sense of it.</p><p></p><p>Didn't Senior say it was his words? How come he's now saying it wasn't him? This is confusing, they wanted to figure it out.</p><p></p><p>"Old Gu, why haven't you gotten up yet? You were kneeling and kowtowing to the Senior so early in the morning, you really are something."</p><p></p><p>An elder went over and helped the dazed Ancient Crane up, laughing.</p><p></p><p>Ancient Crane came back to his senses and gave a dry smile, bowing towards the elegant courtyard before silently leaving. His mind had also calmed down a bit.</p><p></p><p>It seems the Senior has no intention of dealing with him, just said it had nothing to do with him, and didn't expose him in front of the elders, that's great.</p><p></p><p>"Uh."</p><p></p><p>The elders paused, quickly placing the large and small packages at the entrance of the courtyard before leaving one by one.</p><p></p><p>The gifts should still be sent, whether the Senior accepts them or not is his business, but whether they send them or not is another matter.</p><p></p><p>...</p><p></p><p>The next day.</p><p></p><p>Ancient Crane came to the elegant courtyard again.</p><p></p><p>"Senior, when the time comes, please tell the Master that..."</p><p></p><p>Here is the full English translation of the Chinese excerpt:</p><p></p><p>"Elder Helin may soon have to leave the Eastern Domain. If the Master has any needs, you can freely command the other elders in the sect."</p><p></p><p>Ancient Crane Helin looked at the turtle shell on the ground and respectfully said.</p><p></p><p>The old turtle extended its head and four limbs, and leisurely said, "Leave the Eastern Domain? Where are you going?"</p><p></p><p>Ancient Crane Helin gave an embarrassed smile: "With the Master's help, Helin has now reached the Nascent Soul realm, and the Patriarch Zhang Youdao of the Carefree Abode in the Western Domain will be ascending to the Heavenly Tribulation in a little over two months... Cough, this is a rare opportunity, and Helin wishes to go and observe."</p><p></p><p>The old turtle transformed into a human form, rolling his eyes and said, "Are you sure it's the Heavenly Tribulation?"</p><p></p><p>"Indeed." Ancient Crane Helin bowed.</p><p></p><p>"Wait here for a moment." The old turtle said and went into the courtyard.</p><p></p><p>"Master, I heard that little fellow Helin say someone in the Western Domain is about to ascend the Heavenly Tribulation. Shall we go take a look?" The old turtle stood outside the house and asked.</p><p></p><p>"What's the point of watching the Heavenly Tribulation?" Soon, the voice of Lu Changsheng came from inside the house.</p><p></p><p>The old turtle respectfully chuckled, "Master, you must surely remember that the last time I went down to the mortal realm, I passed through the Ascension Passage of this domain."</p><p></p><p>"And then?"</p><p></p><p>"Master, what you don't know is that the other end of this Ascension Passage has been blocked by cultivators from the sects of the Four Domains, killing anyone who tries to ascend." The old turtle said cautiously.</p><p></p><p>"Oh?"</p><p></p><p>The next moment, Lu Changsheng appeared in front of the old turtle.</p><p></p><p>The old turtle took a step back and explained, "It seems that a cultivator from this domain who ascended before had offended the wrong people there, and now they've sent people to block the passage. I didn't pay much attention at the time, so I don't know the details."</p><p></p><p>Lu Changsheng calmly said, "Regardless of right or wrong, those sects daring to block the Ascension Passage and cut off the cultivation path of mortals, it's as if they're killing their own parents."</p><p></p><p>The old turtle sighed helplessly, "Some sects are in remote areas, far from the eyes of the higher powers of the Four Domains. Even if the higher powers know about this, most of them just turn a blind eye to such matters."</p><p></p><p>"When I was in the Immortal Realm, I had established an Immortal Edict that no matter the reason, the receiving sects in all domains must not block the Ascension Passages to the Immortal Realm... I've been gone for a million years, and they dare to violate it? Very well."</p><p></p><p>Lu Changsheng's voice gradually became cold.</p><p></p><p>The old turtle trembled in fear and hurriedly bowed down!</p><p></p><p>He rarely saw Lu Changsheng angry, but when he did, it was earth-shattering!</p><p></p><p>As gentle as he was normally, when angered, he could be ruthless.</p><p></p><p>"Those four fellows seem to be in need of a beating as well. As the Immortal Emperor, have you not done anything about this in the past million years?" Lu Changsheng said indifferently.</p><p></p><p>"Ahem." The old turtle coughed dryly. He knew that the "four fellows" Lu Changsheng referred to were the four Immortal Emperors of the Four Domains, so he said with difficulty, "Master, I've told you before that they are not having an easy time themselves these days... They may not be able to spare the attention for this kind of matter... Moreover, many of the receiving sects have liaised with the higher powers of the various Immortal Realms, so this matter may not have come to the attention of the four Immortal Emperors."</p><p></p><p>Lu Changsheng gave him a sidelong glance, "It seems that you've been getting along quite well with those four fellows over the past million years, that you even dare to make excuses for them."</p><p></p><p>"Master, please calm your anger!" The old turtle cowered in fear, while also firmly protecting his own back. His turtle shell couldn't withstand another beating.</p><p></p><p>Lu Changsheng waved his sleeve and walked out.</p><p></p><p>"Let's go, let's go take a look then."</p>

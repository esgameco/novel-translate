        <h1>Chapter 359</h1>
        <div class="content">
            <p>Here is the full English translation of the Chinese excerpt:</p><p></p><p>"Look, look! Lü Xiaoyou said it's no big deal! You've been hiding and concealing it, but don't worry, I, the King, will absolutely not spread it outside!" </p><p></p><p>Han Jinlong hurriedly said.</p><p></p><p>His heart was truly curious.</p><p></p><p>Jiang Wuxin stared at Lü Changsheng for a moment, thinking: "No big deal?"</p><p></p><p>Lü Xiaoyou, do you know that we and Lord Jianxun have already activated the plan to assassinate you?</p><p></p><p>"Lü Xiaoyou, then... can I say it?" Jiang Wuxin asked in astonishment.</p><p></p><p>In his view, telling the Golden Wheel King wasn't really a big problem, as he still understood Han Jinlong quite well.</p><p></p><p>"Go ahead and say it," Lü Changsheng nodded slightly, with an indifferent expression.</p><p></p><p>Jiang Wuxin nodded, looked at the eagerly anticipating Han Jinlong, and said in a solemn voice:</p><p></p><p>"Zi Xuanyong and the others... believe that Lü Xiaoyou possesses the Eternal Immortal Body."</p><p></p><p>Immediately, Han Jinlong's smile faded, and his expression visibly grew solemn!</p><p></p><p>Eternal... Immortal Body?</p><p></p><p>He suddenly looked at Lü Changsheng, his eyes filled with shock!</p><p></p><p>Han Jinlong finally understood why Lord Jianxun and the Violent King had been so polite to him...</p><p></p><p>Soon, Han Jinlong turned to Jiang Wuxin and said sternly, "Wind Xing Venerable, if that's the case, then Zi Xuanyong and the others... we have to find a way to get rid of them."</p><p></p><p>Jiang Wuxin nodded and said, "I and the Violent King have already approached Lord Jianxun, and after the Seven-colored Glazed Pagoda, we have been planning to assassinate Zi Xuanyong and the others."</p><p></p><p>Han Jinlong nodded solemnly, and looked at Lü Changsheng again, his eyes filled with disbelief.</p><p></p><p>An Eternal Immortal Body that transcends the Divine Monarch Ranking...</p><p></p><p>It has actually appeared among the human race!</p><p></p><p>No wonder Lü Xiaoyou's previous words were correct, the human race should be the supreme among all races!</p><p></p><p>No wonder Lü Xiaoyou was so confident, it turns out he has such a terrifying foundation!</p><p></p><p>Han Jinlong suddenly stood up and bowed deeply to Lü Changsheng:</p><p></p><p>"Lü Xiaoyou, it is fortunate that you have appeared in our human race, in the future... we will rely on you!"</p><p></p><p>Jiang Wuxin also stood up and bowed deeply.</p><p></p><p>This scene was witnessed by Mò Liangqiu and others on the Scorching Sun Celestial Wheel, and they were dumbfounded!</p><p></p><p>What did they see?</p><p></p><p>They saw the Golden Wheel King and the Wind Xing Venerable bowing to Lü Changsheng?!!</p><p></p><p>What's going on? And how did Lü Changsheng's appearance change?</p><p></p><p>They perked up their ears, but unfortunately, the area had already been isolated by Jiang Wuxin, and they couldn't hear anything.</p><p></p><p>...</p><p></p><p>Lü Changsheng looked at the two who had reseated themselves and smiled, "What if I don't have the Eternal Immortal Body?"</p><p></p><p>Jiang Wuxin did not speak, he and the Violent King had already thought about this.</p><p></p><p>It was Han Jinlong, who was always straightforward, who directly asked, "So, does Lü Xiaoyou have it or not?"</p><p></p><p>Lü Changsheng's expression did not change: "Yes, I am the Eternal Immortal Body, the Eternal Immortal Body is me."</p><p></p><p>"Sss—!"</p><p></p><p>Even though Han Jinlong and Jiang Wuxin were rulers of their respective factions, at this moment, they were both sucking in a cold breath and unable to stop!</p><p></p><p>Their expressions first became stiff and unbelievable, then turned excited and flushed!</p><p></p><p>In the end, they even started to tremble with excitement!!</p><p></p><p>The Eternal Immortal Body... is really the Eternal Immortal Body!!</p><p></p><p>For a moment, the two men were staring at the young man in front of them with slightly open mouths, not knowing what to say.</p><p></p><p>Lü Changsheng raised his cup and took a sip, saying softly:</p><p></p><p>"You've treated me pretty well, and haven't harbored any ill intentions. Don't worry, the human race will eventually rise to the top of the Myriad Races Ranking, the human race... has always been the supreme among the Myriad Races."</p><p></p><p>Here is the full English translation of the excerpt from the Chinese novel:</p><p></p><p>Jiang Wuxin and Han Jinlong listened to the grandiose words in their ears, looking at the calm and self-assured young man before them, feeling something stuck in their throats.</p><p></p><p>A hint of reverence gradually appeared in the eyes of the two people...</p><p></p><p>Lu Xiaoyou possessed the Eternal Life Body, and in the future he could be said to be the most noble and highest-ranking person of the human race.</p><p></p><p>"Lu, Lu Xiaoyou, what should we call you, hehe..." Han Jinlong laughed awkwardly.</p><p></p><p>Lu Changsheng smiled and waved his fan, "Just call me as before."</p><p></p><p>Han Jinlong and Feng Xingzun exchanged a glance and nodded.</p><p></p><p>"Lu Xiaoyou, regarding the Eternal Life Body, I won't ask too much, I just want to ask one thing..." Han Jinlong swallowed and said, "Is it really immortal?"</p><p></p><p>Jiang Wuxin also looked seriously at Lu Changsheng, waiting for his answer.</p><p></p><p>Hearing this, Lu Changsheng's gaze became hazy, "It's true, because... I don't even know how long I've lived..."</p><p></p><p>"Hundreds of millions of years, billions of years, trillions of years, or even tens of trillions of years, I can't remember clearly."</p><p></p><p>"It's just that this cultivation progresses very slowly, and it's only recently that it has been progressing faster."</p><p></p><p>Hearing this, Han Jinlong and Jiang Wuxin were completely dumbfounded, pursing their lips and not daring to ask further.</p><p></p><p>Calculated this way, Lu Xiaoyou has lived much longer than them...</p><p></p><p>They thought they had lived for a hundred million years, which was already very long, but they didn't expect Lu Xiaoyou...</p><p></p><p>This is simply a super ancient monster, and they were still calling him "Xiaoyou"...</p><p></p><p>From now on, they wouldn't dare to call Lu Xiaoyou anymore...</p><p></p><p>However, the rumor was that the cultivation of the Eternal Life Body progressed extremely slowly, and today they finally got the verification, the rumor was not false!</p><p></p><p>But at this rate, when will their human race rise up...</p><p></p><p>Lu Changsheng seemed to have noticed the strangeness of Jiang Wuxin and Han Jinlong, and immediately smiled and said, "Don't worry, my cultivation has been progressing faster recently."</p><p></p><p>He wouldn't tell the two that he hadn't found a match since he broke out of the seal a million years ago, would he? Telling them wouldn't make them believe it anyway, so he felt it wasn't necessary, they would understand it sooner or later.</p><p></p><p>Hearing this, the two felt a little relieved.</p><p></p><p>"Lu... oh no, I don't dare to call you that anymore." Han Jinlong's old face flushed red as he cupped his hands and said, "Longevity Daoist Friend."</p><p></p><p>"From now on, we'll just call you Longevity Daoist Friend in private." Jiang Wuxin also cupped his hands.</p><p></p><p>This seems to be the most appropriate way to address him for now, as calling him senior wouldn't be appropriate either, because they felt their current cultivation level was higher than Lu Changsheng's.</p><p></p><p>Lu Changsheng smiled slightly without saying anything.</p><p></p><p>"Longevity Daoist Friend, what alias are you going to use... Old Master also wants to inform those youngsters in advance." Jiang Wuxin smiled.</p><p></p><p>Lu Changsheng pondered for a moment, then smiled spontaneously:</p><p></p><p>"Lu Nan."</p><p></p><p>Lu Nan?</p><p></p><p>Jiang Wuxin and Han Jinlong exchanged a glance and then nodded, "Good."</p><p></p><p>Afterwards, he waved his hand to remove the sound barrier and called out, "You all come over!"</p><p></p><p>Mo Lianqiu and the others heard the call and hurriedly stood up and approached, bowing and paying respects, "Wind Xing Venerable, Golden Wheel King, Lu, Lu Senior."</p><p></p><p>Jiang Wuxin was slightly satisfied, and said in a solemn voice, "When we arrive at the destination, remember, Lu Xiaoyou's alias is Lu Nan, and as for why Lu Xiaoyou needs an alias, Old Master won't explain to you, there are reasons for it!"</p><p></p><p>"Yes, we will remember!" </p><p></p><p>The crowd bowed and acknowledged, silently recording it in their hearts.</p><p></p><p>Lu Changsheng's mouth contained a smile, gently waving his folding fan, but his eyes flickered with a hint of something.</p>

        <h1>Chapter 331</h1>
        <div class="content">
            <p>Here is the full English translation of the Chinese excerpt:</p><p></p><p>The human realm certainly does not only have that one city, although that city is extremely large. üë∫üòÇ‚ùª‚ùæ‰∏ÇÔΩàÔºµùîÅ.ùêúùï†·µê‚òú‚ò†</p><p></p><p>The human realm has a total of three cities, the Heaven City, the Earth City, and the Human City. The one that the old turtle and Li Shuo just saw was the Human City.</p><p></p><p>The three cities of Heaven, Earth, and Human are where the majority of the human race in the Divine-Demon Battlefield resides. The total population of these three major cities is estimated to be in the hundreds of millions.</p><p></p><p>Of course, in the human realm, aside from these three core cities, there are also numerous sects and dynasties. The combined population of these sects and dynasties is also in the hundreds of millions...</p><p></p><p>So it can be said that in the Divine-Demon Battlefield, the human race has the largest population base, which is also an important reason why they are suppressed by the various other races.</p><p></p><p>It is also imaginable how tyrannical the last-ranked Sword Regretless must be, as he is the sole human representative on the rankings, among the hundreds of millions of the human population.</p><p></p><p>It is also imaginable how terrifying and peerless the experts ranked above Sword Regretless must be. None of the non-human races on the rankings are simple characters.</p><p></p><p>In the human realm, normally everyone minds their own business, and there are even frequent frictions between the same race. However, once there is a dispute with the other races, everyone will unite as one to face the external threat.</p><p></p><p>At this moment,</p><p></p><p>Lu Changsheng appeared in another part of the human realm, far away from the Human City.</p><p></p><p>He stood in the air and looked around the environment, then gently waved his sleeve!</p><p></p><p>Suddenly, a Taoist-style sect appeared below, as if it had always been there, blending seamlessly with the surrounding scenery.</p><p></p><p>It was the Carefree Sect. At this moment, the elders and disciples of the Carefree Sect had already been awakened from their cultivation by the disturbance. They looked at the strange scenery before them with delight.</p><p></p><p>"Could it be that we have arrived at the Divine-Demon Battlefield? Has the Sect Master released us?"</p><p></p><p>"This Divine-Demon Battlefield looks quite similar to the Linglong Heavens, nothing particularly special."</p><p></p><p>But the next moment, the disciples exclaimed:</p><p></p><p>"No, the spiritual energy in the air is extremely dense, over a hundred times more than the Linglong Heavens!"</p><p></p><p>"Quick, look at the three massive golden beams in the sky!"</p><p></p><p>"The Myriad Races Ranking, the Divine Body Ranking, the Individual Combat Power Ranking... Sss!"</p><p></p><p>"Wow, there are so many races! On the Myriad Races Ranking, our human race is actually ranked over a thousand!"</p><p></p><p>"The Divine Body Ranking, a hundred divine bodies, but our human race doesn't have a single one..."</p><p></p><p>"On the Individual Combat Power Ranking, we don't have any either... Wait, you all look at the hundredth place, the human Sword Regretless!"</p><p></p><p>"This great hero is the only one from our human race on the ranking. He must be incredibly powerful."</p><p></p><p>"The Divine-Demon Battlefield is truly extraordinary. Just looking at the rankings, I can feel an incomparable pressure."</p><p></p><p>"But speaking of which, what is the reason for the various races to compete in the Divine-Demon Battlefield? There must be a reason, right?"</p><p></p><p>"We've just arrived, how would we know."</p><p></p><p>"..."</p><p></p><p>Aside from the many disciples' exclamations and discussions, Tongxin and Lin Dong also stood there, stunned and awestruck, gazing at the three major rankings.</p><p></p><p>Since leaving the Lingering Dust Realm, every new world they arrived at could shock them, but this Divine-Demon Battlefield has thoroughly refreshed their perception.</p><p></p><p>This world is too prosperous, more awe-inspiring than any previous realm they've seen. Although they haven't really explored this world yet, the three rankings alone are enough.</p><p></p><p>"Shixiong, the names on the rankings must be those renowned throughout the Divine-Demon Battlefield, right?" Lin Dong asked hesitantly.</p><p></p><p>Especially the two hundred names on the Divine Body Ranking and the Combat Power Ranking, each one emanating a domineering golden light, as if exuding an aura of ruling the world and overlooking all.</p><p></p><p>Even without seeing the true celestial talents and peerless experts on the rankings, just looking at the rankings and names alone was suffocating, like a massive weight pressing down on them.</p><p></p><p>Tongxin took a deep breath and wryly smiled, "Probably. We shouldn't think about it anymore. Whether we have divine bodies or not, whether we have the strength or not, any of the rankings have nothing to do with us."</p><p></p><p>Here is my translation of the Chinese excerpt:</p><p></p><p>L√≠n D√≤ng did not speak again, but his gaze kept flickering as he looked up at the rankings.</p><p></p><p>"As you can see, this is the Deity-Demon Battlefield, and the Carefree Sect is now in human territory."</p><p></p><p>At this moment, a familiar, calm voice suddenly sounded from behind the crowd.</p><p></p><p>The startled P√©ng FƒÅng and the others trembled and quickly turned around to salute:</p><p></p><p>"Sect Master!"</p><p></p><p>L√π Ch√°ngshƒìng waved his sleeve, lifting all of them up, and said with a smile like a spring breeze, "I have brought you to the Deity-Demon Battlefield. From now on, you can develop well."</p><p></p><p>The crowd wanted to respond, but for a moment they lacked the courage, for the pressure from the three great rankings above them was too great.</p><p></p><p>Seeing this, L√π Ch√°ngshƒìng's brow furrowed slightly as he pretended to speak coldly, "What? Have you lost confidence?"</p><p></p><p>Suddenly, tens of thousands of Carefree Sect disciples immediately fell to their knees in fear.</p><p></p><p>L√π Ch√°ngshƒìng paced with his hands behind his back and slowly said, "You can be wary, but as my Carefree Sect disciples, you must never lack confidence. All of you here are human, and in the future, you will be the elite combat forces of humanity on the Deity-Demon Battlefield."</p><p></p><p>"For your own sake, for the sake of humanity, do your best."</p><p></p><p>"Yes!" The crowd immediately responded with fists clasped.</p><p></p><p>Since the Sect Master had spoken this way, it must be so, and they could not doubt their faith.</p><p></p><p>L√π Ch√°ngshƒìng was slightly satisfied, and after a moment of contemplation, a scroll appeared in his hand again as he said, "This is the final volume of the Carefree Techniques. As long as my Carefree Sect disciples cultivate the upper, middle, and lower volumes to perfection, everyone can learn this final volume."</p><p></p><p>The many disciples and elder protectors suddenly looked up at the scroll in L√π Ch√°ngshƒìng's hand with burning eyes.</p><p></p><p>They were more familiar with the Carefree Techniques than anyone else, and naturally understood their formidability. To think that... there was also a final volume!</p><p></p><p>"As long as you cultivate the Carefree Techniques to a high level, you may not be unable to compete with those on the rankings. Even if you can't defeat them, they will have difficulty restraining you."</p><p></p><p>L√π Ch√°ngshƒìng's words directly set the hearts of the crowd ablaze.</p><p></p><p>"Thank you, Sect Master!!" The crowd kowtowed and exclaimed, their eyes reddened with excitement.</p><p></p><p>If they, with their mortal bodies, could defeat the ranked divine beings, what a shocking feat that would be!</p><p></p><p>Even if they couldn't make it onto the Divine Being Rankings, they might have a chance to make it onto the Individual Combat Strength Rankings, though the chances were slim... but at least they had a glimmer of hope.</p><p></p><p>"Hehe."</p><p></p><p>L√π Ch√°ngshƒìng smiled faintly and casually tossed the scroll to P√©ng FƒÅng, who hurriedly pounced to catch it, holding it reverently in his arms, handling it with the utmost care.</p><p></p><p>"You don't need to thank me. I, L√π Ch√°ngshƒìng, am the Sect Master of the Carefree Sect. Taking responsibility for you is only natural. However, you can't just take without giving back. You should make contributions to the sect."</p><p></p><p>"For now, I won't say anything else, but at the very least, when you go out, don't embarrass your Sect Master when you say you are a disciple of the Carefree Sect."</p><p></p><p>As he said this, L√π Ch√°ngshƒìng joked.</p><p></p><p>Immediately, the laughter of the elders and disciples resounded, as they were like children in the presence of their own Sect Master.</p><p></p><p>"Alright, from now on, you'll be on your own. The spiritual energy density in this Deity-Demon Battlefield is not bad, and you will gradually understand the effects of the Carefree Techniques."</p><p></p><p>L√π Ch√°ngshƒìng smiled and prepared to leave. Of course, he wouldn't stay and manage them like a father, that would be too tiring. It's better to go and have fun himself.</p><p></p><p>"Sect... Sect Master!"</p><p></p><p>Suddenly, P√©ng FƒÅng called out hesitantly.</p><p></p><p>Hearing this, the crowd turned to look at the Grand Elder, wondering what else he had to say.</p><p></p><p>P√©ng FƒÅng took a deep breath, summoning his courage, and asked while looking up at the three great rankings in the sky:</p><p></p><p>"Sect... Sect Master, P√©ng FƒÅng dares to ask, the powerful ones on the rankings, in relation to you... you..."</p><p></p><p>L√π Ch√°ngshƒìng paused, then shook his head and smiled, disappearing from the martial field.</p><p></p><p>"I'm just here to have fun."</p>

        <h1>Chapter 191</h1>
        <div class="content">
            <p>Here is the full English translation of the Chinese novel excerpt:</p><p></p><p>"Little Black, what's wrong with you?" Cai Xu's unusual behavior immediately caught Huang Bin's attention.</p><p></p><p>"Ah Bin, you, you take a look..." Cai Xu handed the book in his hand over.</p><p></p><p>Huang Bin took it suspiciously and started to read it carefully.</p><p></p><p>"Sss!!!"</p><p></p><p>Soon, he was shocked by the content on the book.</p><p></p><p>"The miscellaneous disciples can receive a seven-colored spirit stone every month??? Is this real???"</p><p></p><p>Huang Bin and Cai Xu were dumbfounded.</p><p></p><p>This Xiaoyao Sect is too extravagant!</p><p></p><p>After all, the inner disciples of Blood Flame Pavilion, Shenluomen, and Nihong Pavilion only seem to have a hundred top-grade spirit stones per month!</p><p></p><p>The outer disciples even only have thirty top-grade spirit stones,</p><p></p><p>As for the miscellaneous disciples of the three major sects, it is said that they only have five hundred high-grade spirit stones per month...</p><p></p><p>What a concept??</p><p></p><p>One seven-colored spirit stone is equivalent to a thousand top-grade spirit stones, in a sense, the value of a seven-colored spirit stone is even higher than a thousand top-grade spirit stones!</p><p></p><p>So... the amount of spirit stones their miscellaneous disciples can receive every month is more than ten times that of the inner disciples of those sects!</p><p></p><p>More than ten times! Oh my god!</p><p></p><p>"Wuwuwu..." Huang Bin suddenly burst into tears.</p><p></p><p>"A-Bin, what's wrong with you?" Cai Xu came back to his senses, feeling awkward about Huang Bin's behavior.</p><p></p><p>"I, I'm fine, I'm just happy! Little Black, I'm glad you brought me to the Xiaoyao Sect, otherwise I would have missed the Xiaoyao Sect... otherwise I'm afraid I'll regret it for the rest of my life!" Huang Bin said with a choked voice.</p><p></p><p>Before Cai Xu could speak, Huang Bin's eyes suddenly burst with a dazzling light, and he growled fiercely,</p><p></p><p>"From today on, I, Huang Bin, will definitely cultivate hard, and I swear to go through fire and water for the Xiaoyao Sect!!!"</p><p></p><p>"Otherwise... I won't feel at ease getting these spirit stones!"</p><p></p><p>Cai Xu also nodded solemnly!</p><p></p><p>Afterwards, the two continued to look at the book, becoming more and more excited, and their breathing became more and more rapid.</p><p></p><p>This Xiaoyao Sect is simply too outrageous!!</p><p></p><p>The various contents in the book made them dream.</p><p></p><p>"Little Black, let's go back to Feiyun City. Now that we have made it, our family will surely be proud of us when they know about it!"</p><p></p><p>"Let's go!"</p><p></p><p>...</p><p></p><p>At the back mountain of the Xiaoyao Sect,</p><p></p><p>Peng Fang finished the last sip of wine, stood up respectfully and said,</p><p></p><p>"Sect Master, Peng Fang will go and get busy now."</p><p></p><p>Lu Changsheng nodded slightly.</p><p></p><p>Seeing this, Peng Fang bent his body and slowly retreated from the pavilion, then disappeared in a flash, </p><p></p><p>Apparently, he was preparing for the recruitment of disciples tomorrow.</p><p></p><p>After sitting quietly for a while, Lu Changsheng glanced in the direction of Feiyun City, and his figure gradually disappeared in the pavilion.</p><p></p><p>He had been in the sect for some time, and the weather was nice today, so he planned to go to Feiyun City for a stroll.</p><p></p><p>At the same time,</p><p></p><p>Peng Fang had already come to the Assembly Hall, where Elder Left Chou Shan, Elder Su Qianghe, and Elder Zhao Wuou had gathered early.</p><p></p><p>As for Yin Jiuguai, he was comfortably in the Registration Hall, and for now, there was nothing for him to do.</p><p></p><p>"Elder."</p><p></p><p>The three elders hurriedly bowed in salute.</p><p></p><p>"Haha, get up, you are all my own people." Peng Fang said with a smile and waved his hand.</p><p></p><p>"Yes." Elder Left Chou Shan, Elder Su Qianghe, and Elder Zhao Wuou stood up and glanced at each other, feeling that the Elder had done something behind their backs.</p><p></p><p>And Elder Su Qianghe's nose twitched, his expression changed, hmm? Alcohol smell?</p><p></p><p>He smelled the scent of alcohol, and the alcohol smell was coming from the Elder... Could it be!</p><p></p><p>Elder Left Chou Shan and Elder Zhao Wuou also quickly noticed it, and they felt uneasy in their hearts.</p><p></p><p>Peng Fang's eyelids twitched when he saw this, and he cursed himself inwardly for being careless and forgetting to deal with the alcohol smell!</p><p></p><p>So he cleared his throat and said, "The Elder was fortunate enough to have a drink with the Sect Master today, but don't worry, the Sect Master also specially rewarded a jar of Xihun Liquor for you four to share... Oh, don't forget the Fourth Elder."</p><p></p><p>Here is the full English translation of the Chinese excerpt:</p><p></p><p>The Three Elders - Left Chou-shan, Su Qiang-he, and Zhao Wu-you - were overjoyed when the Grand Elder produced a pot of wine and pushed it towards them with a chuckle.</p><p></p><p>"The Grand Elder is truly kind, not keeping it to himself!" they exclaimed, quickly dividing the wine into three shares and storing them away in their personal spatial rings.</p><p></p><p>Su Qiang-he patted his chest and assured, "Grand Elder, don't worry, we'll definitely leave some for the Fourth Elder."</p><p></p><p>The three exchanged a glance, their eyes seeming to say: "Sorry, Nine Puppets, the three of us can barely finish this pot of wine. Maybe next time."</p><p></p><p>"Alright, let's get down to business," Peng Fang said, his expression turning serious.</p><p></p><p>The three elders immediately sobered up, knowing the Sect Master was about to speak.</p><p></p><p>"The Sect Master has said that starting tomorrow, our Serene Sect will begin recruiting disciples in various cities," Peng Fang announced solemnly.</p><p></p><p>The three elders were stunned - the sect was finally moving forward.</p><p></p><p>Peng Fang gave out instructions for the elders to carry out their tasks. After they had left, his expression transformed into a self-satisfied, sly smile, like that of a Maitreya Buddha. </p><p></p><p>He took a sip of the wine, then sighed ruefully, "Damn, I should have been more careful. Originally there were five pots, but now there's only four left. Alas."</p><p></p><p>He then smacked his own head, looking quite dismayed.</p><p></p><p>Meanwhile, in Feiyun City, Cai Xu and Huang Bin were shocked to find the cultivators abuzz with discussions about the Serene Sect. Apparently, the sect's disciples had just visited the city, and the talk was about the sect's supposedly excellent treatment of its members, even better than the Three Major Sects. </p><p></p><p>Cai Xu and Huang Bin scoffed. They knew the Serene Sect's recruitment standards from the information they had seen, and they were certain that no more than 30 cultivators in Feiyun City would be accepted, and most of them would only be servants.</p><p></p><p>Holding their heads high, they strode through the crowd, deliberately flaunting their "Serene Sect Servant" disciple tokens. Many cultivators eyed them curiously, not understanding their arrogance, until they noticed the tokens and realized the two were merely servant disciples of the Serene Sect.</p>

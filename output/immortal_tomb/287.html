        <h1>Chapter 287</h1>
        <div class="content">
            <p>Here is the full English translation of the Chinese excerpt:</p><p></p><p>"Sss‚Äî"</p><p></p><p>The crowd first paused in bewilderment, then drew a sharp breath. üí≤üêº‚ûÖ‚ùæùìº‚ÑçœÖùîÅ.ùî†ùêéùìúüç¨üéÉ</p><p></p><p>They looked at him in disbelief, wondering if their senior really hadn't reached over 10 million years of age?? </p><p></p><p>It was quite possible...</p><p></p><p>Otherwise, their senior wouldn't have asserted so firmly that there was no problem.</p><p></p><p>After all, when it came to the test stone, there was no room for deception.</p><p></p><p>A sword cultivator at the late-stage Divine Yang Realm, who had not yet reached 10 million years of age, was already a formidable and nearly invincible figure at that level!</p><p></p><p>It was simply mind-boggling!</p><p></p><p>Fu Shiyu, Liu Xing, and Fu Tao were all dumbfounded.</p><p></p><p>At the same same age, how could the gap be so vast...</p><p></p><p>Especially for Fu Shiyu, her eyes were filled with trepidation!</p><p></p><p>She knew that the person before her was capable of contending with the Heavenly Dao!! His true strength must exceed the Divine Yang Realm!!</p><p></p><p>Yet his age was similar to hers?</p><p></p><p>She felt not admiration, but boundless fear, for this defied all logic.</p><p></p><p>Liu Tu and the others swallowed hard, but their hearts were racing with excitement.</p><p></p><p>If what their senior said was true,</p><p></p><p>then the dark horse of this Heavenly Monarch Assembly was standing right before their eyes!!</p><p></p><p>As a late-stage Divine Yang Realm cultivator and a sword cultivator, wouldn't he be able to wreak havoc at the Heavenly Monarch Assembly?</p><p></p><p>They still had a lingering doubt, for this was simply too outrageous.</p><p></p><p>Only after the test at the test stone, after a thorough verification...</p><p></p><p>As the crowd pondered with furrowed brows, the flying ship had already unknowingly crossed over the towering Ancient Wasteland City, heading towards the city center.</p><p></p><p>Looking down from above, they could see countless figures thronging within the vast Ancient Wasteland City.</p><p></p><p>At the heart of the city, where the crowd was densest, beams of light would occasionally flash, connecting heaven and earth.</p><p></p><p>This scene was all too familiar to Liu Tu and the others, so Fu Liang quickly pointed towards that area and respectfully said, "Senior Lu, the area with the most people should be the testing ground!"</p><p></p><p>"Good, then let's go there for the test first, and then we'll make our plans." Lu Changsheng smiled as he looked towards that place.</p><p></p><p>"Yes."</p><p></p><p>Hearing this, Fu Liang promptly controlled the flying ship and headed in that direction.</p><p></p><p>Fu Shiyu and the others grew somewhat nervous, for the test stone was the first hurdle of the Heavenly Monarch Assembly.</p><p></p><p>Only by passing the test stone's recognition could one be called a Heavenly Monarch and have the qualifications to participate in the Heavenly Monarch Assembly.</p><p></p><p>...</p><p></p><p>At the city center,</p><p></p><p>ten stone pillars stood tall, their surfaces covered in dense inscriptions.</p><p></p><p>At this moment, countless talented young cultivators were lining up in front of these ten stone pillars, their eyes gleaming with eagerness and trepidation.</p><p></p><p>Whenever a beam of light flashed, it would stir up a clamor.</p><p></p><p>For the lighting of the beam of light meant that the one being tested had passed the test stone and could now participate in the Heavenly Monarch Assembly.</p><p></p><p>Moreover, the color of the beam also held significance, ranging from white, yellow, azure, to purple.</p><p></p><p>Corresponding to the Immortal Emperor, Immortal Ancestor, Divine Origin, and Divine Yang Realms respectively.</p><p></p><p>Just as Lu Changsheng and the others arrived at this place,</p><p></p><p>"Sizzle sizzle sizzle‚Äî"</p><p></p><p>Ten beams of light simultaneously flashed on the stone pillars!</p><p></p><p>Nine yellow beams, and one azure beam!</p><p></p><p>Instantly, the area erupted in commotion, as all eyes turned towards the stone pillar with the azure beam of light:</p><p></p><p>"Wow, a Heavenly Monarch of the Divine Origin Realm who's not even 10 million years old!! This is the how many we've seen today? The competition in this Heavenly Monarch Assembly is truly fierce!"</p><p></p><p>"Who is that Heavenly Monarch? Divine Origin Realm Heavenly Monarchs are not obscure figures!"</p><p></p><p>"I remember, I think it's the young master of the Miu Clan from the city."</p><p></p><p>"Tsk tsk, another local from the central city, as expected of the profound foundation of the central metropolis."</p><p></p><p>Here is the full English translation of the Chinese excerpt:</p><p></p><p>The young master of the Miao clan, who stood beside the azure light beam, seemed to enjoy the discussions of the crowd. He raised his chin and looked at the other nine with disdain, then retreated under the escort of his servants as the crowd hurriedly made way for him.</p><p></p><p>As for the other nine overlords, they were relatively less outstanding.</p><p></p><p>Soon, this batch retreated, and the next batch followed. </p><p></p><p>The testing stone was unguarded, and everyone tested themselves.</p><p></p><p>If the test was successful, they would be recorded on the testing stone and qualify to participate in the Grand Assembly of Overlords, which was considered relatively advanced.</p><p></p><p>Lu Changsheng, Fu Shiyu, and the three of them also joined the queue at the back.</p><p></p><p>As for Liu Tu and the others, they were nervously watching from the crowd.</p><p></p><p>"Sss sss sss‚Äî"</p><p></p><p>At this moment, another light beam lit up, eight golden light beams. Strangely, there were two stone pillars that did not have any light beams.</p><p></p><p>Countless strange gazes immediately turned to them.</p><p></p><p>The two people's faces alternated between red and purple, extremely embarrassed, and they immediately turned to flee.</p><p></p><p>But at this moment, two black-gold ropes suddenly shot out from the two stone pillars behind them and firmly bound the two people!</p><p></p><p>At the same time, a indifferent voice, indistinguishable as male or female, came from the stone pillars:</p><p></p><p>"Trying to sneak into the Grand Assembly of Overlords at the Shen Yuan Realm of only three million years?"</p><p></p><p>The two people's scalps tingled, and they frantically tried to break free of the ropes. "Spare us, please spare us!!"</p><p></p><p>"Hmph." The next moment, two beams of light suddenly shot out from the testing stone, instantly annihilating the two people.</p><p></p><p>The area fell silent.</p><p></p><p>The two Shen Yuan Realm cultivators who tried to sneak in had just died...</p><p></p><p>At this time, in the queue in front of the testing stone, many people turned pale-faced and quickly left the queue under the shocked gazes of others.</p><p></p><p>"Continue the test," the voice from the stone pillar sounded again, then fell silent.</p><p></p><p>Soon, the overlords resumed testing in silence, the atmosphere a little more solemn, after all, two powerful Shen Yuan Realm experts had just been killed.</p><p></p><p>"Phew, Senior Liu Tu, what do you think about Senior Lu... I'm a bit nervous," Fu Liancai said with a pale face, transmitting a message to Liu Tu.</p><p></p><p>Liu Tu did not respond to him, but looked at the testing stone with trepidation. </p><p></p><p>He had a premonition that even he would be instantly killed if he faced that terrifying light beam.</p><p></p><p>"Brother Fu, don't worry, Senior Lu should be fine. You see, after those two Shen Yuan Realm were killed, many people in the queue fled, probably just trying to sneak in. But Senior Lu hasn't run away, so he should be within a million years," Liu Qing said admiringly through a transmission.</p><p></p><p>At the same time, in the queue, Fu Shiyu looked at the calm blue-robed figure in the adjacent queue, her gaze slightly worried.</p><p></p><p>She knew her senior was extremely powerful, probably someone the testing stone couldn't even kill, but it would still be embarrassing if he messed up.</p><p></p><p>Just then, a sudden burst of purple light in front shocked everyone's eyes!!</p><p></p><p>A Shen Yang Realm overlord!!</p><p></p><p>Lu Changsheng's gaze turned to the direction, only to see a woman in a blood-red dress standing silently in front of the shimmering purple light beam of the testing stone.</p><p></p><p>"She... she is Blood Moon!!"</p><p></p><p>"Blood Moon?? The top-ranked No. 5 overlord, Blood Moon??"</p><p></p><p>"Wow, seeing the real person today, her figure is really good, it's just a pity her face is covered, but I bet she must be a great beauty!"</p><p></p><p>"Amazing, a Shen Yang Realm under a million years, I wonder how many rounds of Proud Yang she has condensed."</p>

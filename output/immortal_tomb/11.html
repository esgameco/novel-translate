        <h1>Chapter 11</h1>
        <div class="content">
            <p>Here is the full English translation of the Chinese excerpt:</p><p></p><p>The children chased the elusive spirit disc like locusts, leaping and bounding rapidly. üê§üíù‚ùªÔºô≈úÂçÑœÖ–ñ.‚ÑÇ„Ññ–º‚ô§‚ôü</p><p></p><p>Soon, they followed the elusive spirit disc to the southwest corner of Jia Yuan City.</p><p></p><p>This area was relatively secluded, with only a few households, and at this time their doors were tightly closed, but the lights were still on.</p><p></p><p>Seeing the elusive spirit disc hovering in the air and trembling constantly, Tong Xin said in a low voice, "The demons should be here. This is a formation flag. You all quickly go and plant them in these positions..."</p><p></p><p>As he spoke, a formation flag appeared in Tong Xin's hand, and he handed it to the disciples, while also retrieving the elusive spirit disc.</p><p></p><p>"Yes."</p><p></p><p>Hearing this, a few disciples thought briefly and then quickly began to deploy the formation in this area. Although they did not understand the formation techniques, Tong Xin had told them the positions, so it was quite simple to just plant the flags.</p><p></p><p>"Big Brother Tong is really amazing, he even knows such profound formation techniques."</p><p></p><p>The two female disciples in the group looked at Tong Xin with admiration as they spoke.</p><p></p><p>Tong Xin pretended to be aloof and smiled slightly, not responding.</p><p></p><p>He looked at the disciples who were planting the flags, then scanned the area, his gaze flickering.</p><p></p><p>There were civilians here, so he must eliminate the demons of Jia Yuan City before the invisibility talisman expires.</p><p></p><p>He would not be careless, for the elder Gu He had taught him the most important lesson - to navigate carefully and steadily.</p><p></p><p>"Big Brother Tong, the formation flags have been planted!"</p><p></p><p>Soon, the disciples returned to Tong Xin and reported.</p><p></p><p>Tong Xin nodded and murmured while scanning the space, "Good, then let's bring out these sneaky, dirty things... You all step back!"</p><p></p><p>As he spoke, the disciples hurriedly retreated, staring at Tong Xin without blinking.</p><p></p><p>Tong Xin flipped his palm, and a formation flag appeared in his hand. He began to wave it rapidly and rhythmically in the air.</p><p></p><p>As he waved, the disciples were shocked to see that the formation flags planted in different positions all emitted a faint glow at the same time and began to "hum, hum, hum" in vibration!</p><p></p><p>Suddenly!</p><p></p><p>This violent commotion caught the attention of the lurking demons!!</p><p></p><p>The next moment, the doors of several households in the area all opened with a "creak", and three balls of black mist rushed out!!</p><p></p><p>"These are demonic creatures, not beasts!"</p><p></p><p>This scene left the disciples stunned. They immediately looked into the houses through the doors and indeed saw several dried corpses lying on the ground in each house!</p><p></p><p>Their expressions changed slightly, realizing that the civilians here had all been killed before they arrived!</p><p></p><p>The moment the three balls of black mist rushed out, they immediately noticed the trembling, glowing formation flags on the ground.</p><p></p><p>"Damn it! There are cultivators ambushing us, I don't know their cultivation level, we must retreat!!"</p><p></p><p>Knowing that the civilians had all been killed, Tong Xin no longer concealed himself and revealed his true form, coldly smiling, "So you are a few demonic creatures, daring to cause trouble in the territory of my Qing Yun Sect. Thinking of escaping? Hurry and show your true forms!"</p><p></p><p>As he spoke, Tong Xin raised the formation flag in his hand, channeling spiritual power into it, and then swung it forcefully.</p><p></p><p>"Second-tier Restraining Formation, activate!"</p><p></p><p>Hum, hum, hum!</p><p></p><p>The formation flags trembled more and more violently, and a transparent barrier began to spread out in the area.</p><p></p><p>The three balls of black mist abruptly halted!</p><p></p><p>"Second-tier Restraining Formation... We thought you were such a powerful cultivator, but it turns out you're only at the Qi Condensation stage, haha..."</p><p></p><p>One of the black mist balls sneered coldly.</p><p></p><p>Hearing this, Tong Xin's expression changed slightly.</p><p></p><p>Soon, he saw the three balls of black mist take on three bizarre forms. They had single horns on their heads, their mouths were stretched wide, and their thin black tongues hung down. Their entire faces were pitch-black and ugly.</p><p></p><p>"Black-Tongued Demons!"</p><p></p><p>Tong Xin's body suddenly trembled, and his expression became extremely unsightly.</p><p></p><p>"Black-Tongued Demons... Big Brother Tong, what are those...?"</p><p></p><p>Seeing Tong Xin's expression, the disciples also felt a sense of foreboding.</p><p></p><p>"That is their demonic name. Black-Tongued Demons are second-tier demonic creatures. Even a single second-tier demonic creature is..."</p><p></p><p>Here is the full English translation of the Chinese excerpt:</p><p></p><p>"This place can rival the early Foundation Establishment cultivators, yet there are three of them here..." </p><p></p><p>Tongxin clenched his fist tightly, his face filled with gravity. It seems that today will be difficult to resolve.</p><p></p><p>Rivaling early Foundation Establishment cultivators!! </p><p></p><p>The expressions of the disciples changed abruptly to one of terror, their faces deathly pale as they looked at the three Black Tongue Demons before them.</p><p></p><p>It's over, it's over. Among them, only Senior Brother Tong is in the Foundation Establishment stage, the rest are merely in the Qi Condensation stage. How can they fight against these three demonic beasts?</p><p></p><p>Could it be that their fortune is so poor, that their cultivation journey has reached its end already?</p><p></p><p>"Haha, the little cultivators of the Azure Cloud Sect..."</p><p></p><p>At this time, the leading Black Tongue Demon looked at Tongxin with a chilling smile, easily seeing that aside from the Foundation Establishment disciple, the others were merely in the Qi Condensation stage.</p><p></p><p>Tongxin also felt immense pressure, but he still calmed his breathing and shouted, "That's right, theÈõ¢Ê∞¥Empire is under the protection of my Azure Cloud Sect. You demonic beasts, leave at once!"</p><p></p><p>Seeing Tongxin's imposing manner, the disciples felt a glimmer of hope. Could Senior Brother Tong have some hidden trump card!</p><p></p><p>"Haha! How laughable! Just because you are in the early Foundation Establishment stage?" </p><p></p><p>The Black Tongue Demon clearly did not buy it.</p><p></p><p>"I am a direct disciple of the Azure Cloud Sect, under the tutelage of the venerable Gu He Lin! You little demons better think carefully!" Tongxin took a deep breath and invoked his master's name, trying to intimidate the Black Tongue Demons.</p><p></p><p>He said all this to protect the outer sect disciples behind him!</p><p></p><p>If they were to engage in battle with these three Black Tongue Demons today, the Qi Condensation stage disciples behind him would have no chance of escaping...</p><p></p><p>Gu He Lin!</p><p></p><p>The three Black Tongue Demons visibly trembled, showing that this name brought them a certain degree of pressure.</p><p></p><p>Tongxin was delighted to see this, but the joy soon disappeared, for the Black Tongue Demon spoke again,</p><p></p><p>"Unexpectedly, this early Foundation Establishment disciple has some background. Since that's the case, we can't let you all leave..." the demon chuckled ominously.</p><p></p><p>Subsequently, the crowd saw the three Black Tongue Demons transform into black mist and violently collide against the invisible restrictive formation.</p><p></p><p>Boom!</p><p></p><p>The flags of the formation shook violently at this time!</p><p></p><p>This thunderous sound echoed through the quiet night sky of Jia Yuan City, causing many civilians to tremble in their homes, not knowing what had happened, but remembering the previous order from the City Lord, they could only tightly shut their doors and curl up inside.</p><p></p><p>The Black Tongue Demons evilly smiled and launched a second assault!</p><p></p><p>In the next moment, the formation flags were swaying left and right...</p><p></p><p>The second-tier restrictive formation was easily broken!</p><p></p><p>"Senior Brother Tong!!" </p><p></p><p>The disciples' faces were horrified, all looking at Tongxin with panic.</p><p></p><p>Tongxin's face was grave as he sternly commanded, "Fellow disciples, remain calm. Your senior brother will do his best to protect you all! Fight!"</p><p></p><p>Hearing this, the disciples steeled their resolve, various sword and blade spiritual tools appearing in their hands as they glared at the approaching black mist.</p><p></p><p>However, their expressions were rather desperate.</p><p></p><p>The battle was about to commence!</p><p></p><p>Meanwhile, </p><p></p><p>In the Qian Manor, in the Moli Town.</p><p></p><p>The dim lights, the chilly wind, the sixty-seven white shrouds covering the bodies on the ground slightly trembled.</p><p></p><p>Suddenly, a young man in blue robes silently appeared in the courtyard.</p><p></p><p>Lu Changsheng glanced at the shrouded bodies scattered on the ground, his expression unchanged, then he spoke indifferently,</p><p></p><p>"Come out."</p><p></p><p>The courtyard was deathly silent, only the ominous wind had increased slightly.</p><p></p><p>"You little demon, daring to hide from me."</p><p></p><p>Lu Changsheng's eyes looked calmly at a certain spot in the courtyard, his tone leisurely.</p><p></p><p>It's true that Lu Changsheng had lost the memories related to the immortal tomb, he didn't know why he was in this world, didn't know why he was buried in the so-called immortal tomb, and didn't know what had happened...</p><p></p><p>But any previous memories unrelated to the immortal tomb were still intact in his mind.</p><p></p><p>Before being buried in the immortal tomb, he had casually taken on the role of an immortal emperor due to his idle nature.</p><p></p><p>In the vast immortal realms, the Eternal Immortal Emperor, Lu Changsheng.</p>

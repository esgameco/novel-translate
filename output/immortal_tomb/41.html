        <h1>Chapter 41</h1>
        <div class="content">
            <p>Here is the full English translation of the Chinese excerpt:</p><p></p><p>"Lord, the arrows of our garrison guards are having no effect on these demonic beasts! And it seems these demonic beasts are about to attack soon!" </p><p></p><p>On the town wall, the steward turned his head and looked at Chen Datao with a worried expression on his face.</p><p></p><p>The two of them now, the steward had more white hair and more wrinkles on his face, looking even more aged, while Chen Datao's temples were also slightly graying, and his skin had turned quite sallow.</p><p></p><p>"I'm not blind," Chen Datao stared at the demonic beasts in front of him, responding impatiently.</p><p></p><p>"Shall we call the Master then?" the steward asked awkwardly.</p><p></p><p>Whenever there was trouble, they had to call the Master, and he still felt quite ashamed about it.</p><p></p><p>Chen Datao sighed, "I don't even know if the Master is still living in the backyard, I haven't seen him in a long time, and I don't dare to disturb him when there's nothing urgent."</p><p></p><p>The steward also sighed, he was already old, life and death didn't matter much to him anymore, it was just the people of the town and the Lord...</p><p></p><p>"Alright, steward, you and the garrison commander stay here and keep watch, I'll go to the backyard of the manor to look for the Master."</p><p></p><p>Chen Datao said and then hurriedly ran down from the town wall.</p><p></p><p>...</p><p></p><p>"Master, Datao seeks an audience!" </p><p></p><p>Chen Datao called out respectfully outside the courtyard.</p><p></p><p>But after a while, there was no response coming from within the courtyard.</p><p></p><p>Chen Datao had an ominous feeling, and then gritted his teeth and rushed into the courtyard.</p><p></p><p>Only to find the courtyard empty.</p><p></p><p>The cool pavilion that usually had a figure in blue robes was now gone...</p><p></p><p>Chen Datao's gaze changed slightly, realizing something, and then ran to search all the rooms in the backyard.</p><p></p><p>In the end, he sat down dejectedly.</p><p></p><p>"Has the Master really left?"</p><p></p><p>At the same time,</p><p></p><p>Outside the ascension portal of the Spiritual Dust Realm.</p><p></p><p>Lu Changsheng stood in the void, his eyes calmly gazing at the closed illusory gate.</p><p></p><p>The next moment,</p><p></p><p>The illusory gate slowly opened, and a jet-black old turtle swam out...</p><p></p><p>It swam up to Lu Changsheng, its aged turtle eyes trembling as it looked at Lu Changsheng.</p><p></p><p>"Old Turtle, it's been a while," Lu Changsheng said with a faint smile.</p><p></p><p>"Master, the 'while' you speak of is quite long," the old turtle sighed reflectively, "From the day you disappeared from the Four Directions Immortal Realm, until now, it has been a full one million years."</p><p></p><p>Recently, he had suddenly sensed Lu Changsheng's aura and came searching from the Four Directions Immortal Realm, searching through many worlds before finally pinpointing this unassuming Spiritual Dust Realm.</p><p></p><p>"One million years..." Lu Changsheng was stunned.</p><p></p><p>He had previously heard from Ancient Crane Forest that it had been at least ten thousand years, never imagining it had increased tenfold.</p><p></p><p>"Master, where have you been these one million years?" the old turtle asked.</p><p></p><p>"You may not believe it, but I was buried alive," Lu Changsheng said helplessly.</p><p></p><p>The old turtle: "?"</p><p></p><p>Lu Changsheng shrugged.</p><p></p><p>The old turtle completely trusted Lu Changsheng, so he exclaimed in shock, "In the boundless heavens and earth, who would have the ability to do this? And what was their purpose?"</p><p></p><p>"That is also what puzzles me, but never mind, since I am immortal, the truth will eventually be revealed. Another day, I'll take you to see that burial site," Lu Changsheng said with a smile.</p><p></p><p>"Master, these one million years, I have been so lonely, in the river of time, only you can keep me company. This time, please don't disappear again," the old turtle said somewhat sadly.</p><p></p><p>"Haha." Lu Changsheng didn't pick up on that thread, but instead smiled and said, "Old Turtle, during the time I was buried, my powers that had previously reached their limits seem to have grown 'somewhat' further."</p><p></p><p>The old turtle was stunned, there was such a thing? </p><p></p><p>After all, one million years ago, Lu Changsheng's strength was already terrifying beyond measure, and now his powers had actually progressed further?</p><p></p><p>He knew that Lu Changsheng...</p><p></p><p>Here is the full English translation of the Chinese excerpt:</p><p></p><p>Since it has been said, it is definitely not just a "little" increase.</p><p></p><p>The new 69 book bar 99.com</p><p></p><p>The old turtle hesitated and said, "Master, why don't you try hitting my shell?"</p><p></p><p>Lu Changsheng pursed his lips and said, "Or should I just flick it lightly with my finger? Otherwise, I'm afraid your shell won't be able to withstand it."</p><p></p><p>"Impossible," the old turtle exclaimed directly.</p><p></p><p>However, this old turtle was almost an immortal existence, and after countless years, even he didn't know how hard his shell had become.</p><p></p><p>In any case, it was absolutely very hard.</p><p></p><p>In the past, Lu Changsheng had also struck his shell before, but aside from shaking his brain, it hadn't been breached.</p><p></p><p>"Master, you might as well punch it, I can take it......"</p><p></p><p>Before the old turtle could finish speaking, Lu Changsheng lightly flicked his finger on the turtle's shell......</p><p></p><p>Snap.</p><p></p><p>The sound was very crisp.</p><p></p><p>Crack......</p><p></p><p>But a crack appeared on the turtle's shell.</p><p></p><p>This light flick on the shell caused a vibration that made the old turtle's whole body agonizingly painful!</p><p></p><p>It hurt, it hurt so much!</p><p></p><p>The old turtle's pupils contracted, and he finally couldn't hold back and let out a miserable scream,</p><p></p><p>"Ah!!"</p><p></p><p>.........</p><p></p><p>The old turtle's miserable scream reverberated through the entire Lingchen Realm, and vanished in an instant.</p><p></p><p>At the same time,</p><p></p><p>The common people of the four domains were stunned and bewildered as they looked up at the sky.</p><p></p><p>Countless cultivators in the Immortal Cultivation Realm who were in seclusion directly coughed up a mouthful of fresh blood, their eyes filled with terror, almost losing control.</p><p></p><p>Many sects were stirred up, and some powerful cultivators at the Spirit Severing or Tribulation Crossing realm had their eyes narrowed as they looked towards the direction of the Ascension Passage.</p><p></p><p>This miserable scream came from the Ascension Passage!</p><p></p><p>Their eyes flickering, they hurried towards the Ascension Passage.</p><p></p><p>The Lishui Empire.</p><p></p><p>The movements of the demonic beasts that were preparing to or already colliding suddenly stopped, and a human-like terror appeared in their eyes.</p><p></p><p>In the astonished gaze of the towns and common people, they fled in a flash......</p><p></p><p>.........</p><p></p><p>Lu Changsheng looked at the old turtle who was gasping for air and smiled, "See, it's a good thing I didn't use my fist."</p><p></p><p>The old turtle had a gloomy expression, looking at Lu Changsheng with a hint of awe.</p><p></p><p>Damn, the master has become even stronger.</p><p></p><p>In the past, he still thought the master couldn't quite control him, but now it's simply......</p><p></p><p>Lu Changsheng's eyes flashed as he said, "Someone's coming, let's go."</p><p></p><p>The old turtle nodded, turning into a fruit-sized form and landing on Lu Changsheng's shoulder, his turtle neck stretching out long, and he exhaled towards the crack on his shell, "Master, my shell has cracked, and it will take some time to repair."</p><p></p><p>Lu Changsheng glanced at him sideways and said, "Whether you repair it or not, it doesn't matter, as no one can shake your shell anyway."</p><p></p><p>With that, Lu Changsheng took a step and disappeared from the Ascension Passage.</p><p></p><p>Just after Lu Changsheng and the old turtle had left,</p><p></p><p>A group of cultivators arrived at the Ascension Passage.</p><p></p><p>They respectfully saluted each other, then looked around the Ascension Passage, their eyes flashing with doubt.</p><p></p><p>"What was that miserable scream just now? It actually came from the Ascension Passage?"</p><p></p><p>A beautiful woman asked with a puzzled expression.</p><p></p><p>After all, only cultivators at the Spirit Severing realm and above had the qualifications to sense the exact location of the Ascension Passage.</p><p></p><p>"Miss Qin's words are exactly our own doubts. That miserable scream didn't even sound like it was from a human, how strange." An old man with a hunched back sighed as he stroked his beard.</p><p></p><p>"Hehe, Zhang Daoist, are you about to ascend as well?" A middle-aged man smiled and asked the old man, his eyes filled with a hint of envy.</p><p></p><p>Some Spirit Severing cultivators remained silent, as the few Tribulation Crossing great experts here were the current overlords of the Lingchen Immortal Cultivation Realm.</p><p></p><p>They did not have the right to speak yet.</p>

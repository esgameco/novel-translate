        <h1>Chapter 77</h1>
        <div class="content">
            <p>Here is the full English translation of the Chinese excerpt:</p><p></p><p>"The four of you may leave. ‚òÆ‚ôï‚ùª‚ùæùìàùì±‡∏¢–ñ.Ôº£ÔΩèùêåüíò‡∂è," he said.</p><p></p><p>After saying this, a hint of mockery flashed in the depths of the six attendants' eyes as they were about to turn and leave.</p><p></p><p>Gu Helin's expression changed slightly, and he was about to speak up, but Old Turtle swatted his hand down and calmly said to the retreating figure of the six attendants, "Stop."</p><p></p><p>The six attendants paused and turned around, smiling, "Is there anything else?"</p><p></p><p>Old Turtle's face was expressionless as he asked, "You just said the teleportation formation was broken, correct?"</p><p></p><p>The six attendants' eyes flickered, and he replied, "That's right."</p><p></p><p>Old Turtle patiently asked further, "What if the teleportation formation wasn't broken?"</p><p></p><p>"If this attendant said it was broken, then it was broken. Would I deceive you all?" The six attendants' face showed impatience.</p><p></p><p>Old Turtle suddenly raised his hand!</p><p></p><p>The six attendants' expression changed, and his body flew towards Old Turtle, only to be firmly grasped in his hand the next moment!</p><p></p><p>"What are you trying to do?" the six attendants choked out, his face flushed, already feeling a sense of panic.</p><p></p><p>This person was indeed a true Transcendent Immortal Lord, and the mighty Primordial Ancestor was captured with a single move, leaving him no room for counterattack!</p><p></p><p>Old Turtle stared at him and sneered, "Let me tell you, if the teleportation formation is truly broken, then so be it. But if it's not broken... then today will not end well for you."</p><p></p><p>"Do you know where you are?" the six attendants shouted in a pale face, inwardly sighing that he had encountered a tough opponent.</p><p></p><p>How overbearing!</p><p></p><p>Gu Helin's body was tense, but he could only watch silently, his heart filled with worry! </p><p></p><p>Of course, his worry was for the Tianrun Trading Company!</p><p></p><p>"Hmph, Old Turtle doesn't care where this is," Old Turtle said, looking at Lu Changsheng and respectfully asking, "Master, what's next?"</p><p></p><p>"You'll see," Lu Changsheng said softly.</p><p></p><p>Gu Helin's eyes flashed as he recalled Old Turtle's actions outside Moyu Town, and he quickly summoned a stool and placed it behind Lu Changsheng.</p><p></p><p>Lu Changsheng looked straight ahead and slowly sat down.</p><p></p><p>Chu Xiran pressed her lips together, well, this Daoist companion Lu is just going to watch the show...</p><p></p><p>The commotion quickly attracted many onlookers.</p><p></p><p>Numerous people turned their gazes over, and upon seeing the Tianrun Trading Company's attendant being grabbed by the neck, their expressions were shocked!</p><p></p><p>Heavens, someone dared to cause trouble at the Tianrun Trading Company.</p><p></p><p>Immediately, the cultivators on the first floor of the trading company began to gather...</p><p></p><p>"Who are you people, daring to act recklessly in our Tianrun Trading Company? Release the Sixth Attendant Lord at once!" </p><p></p><p>The dozen or so uniformed receptionists on the first floor came over and sternly shouted.</p><p></p><p>"Five breaths of time, summon your company's president, or he'll die," Old Turtle said mockingly.</p><p></p><p>At these words, not only were the receptionists dumbfounded, even the surrounding cultivators were startled.</p><p></p><p>Many cultivators had already recognized Old Turtle's voice as the one from the thunderstorm a few days ago, and their hearts began to race.</p><p></p><p>This was the Transcendent Immortal Lord from the thunderstorm...</p><p></p><p>"Quick, go call the president! What are you all standing there for?!" </p><p></p><p>The six attendant shouted with great urgency.</p><p></p><p>"Two breaths left," Old Turtle said indifferently.</p><p></p><p>Hearing this, everyone was greatly alarmed, and the six attendant's face turned deathly pale. He regretted it!</p><p></p><p>At this moment, a middle-aged, chubby man appeared, smiling insincerely, "Fellow Daoist, I am Zhu, the president of the Tianrun Trading Company. Please release our attendant. Is there a misunderstanding? Why don't we sit down and have a good chat?"</p><p></p><p>The president of the Tianrun Trading Company, Zhu Qiang!</p><p></p><p>Everyone's palms were already sweating with excitement, never expecting such a scene to unfold at this trading company.</p><p></p><p>Here is the full English translation of the Chinese excerpt:</p><p></p><p>What a show this is going to be.</p><p></p><p>New 69 Book Bar ‚Üí 69shux.com</p><p></p><p>"President!" Before the six attendants could express their surprise,</p><p></p><p>*Crack!*</p><p></p><p>The old turtle suddenly twisted, snapping the neck of the attendant and violently dispersing the spiritual embryo within him!</p><p></p><p>Then he threw the corpse in front of Zhu Qiang, like tossing out garbage. *Thud!*</p><p></p><p>"You're too late. Your subordinate died unjustly. He must not have expected to die, and his own president came tardily. Hehe," the old turtle laughed.</p><p></p><p>Lu Changsheng's group silently watched from the side. Chu Xiruo didn't seem to mind, but Gu Helin's face had turned pale.</p><p></p><p>He knew that Elder Turtle had killed this attendant, and today's matter might not be easily resolved.</p><p></p><p>At this moment, the space was deathly silent.</p><p></p><p>One by one, the attendants and guards from the other floors came to stand behind Zhu Qiang. They stared dumbfoundedly at the corpse of the sixth attendant.</p><p></p><p>"Sixth Brother..." the fifth attendant murmured. Just a few days ago, he and the sixth attendant had gone to that nameless restaurant together, and now he was dead.</p><p></p><p>Zhu Qiang's face lost its smile as he calmly asked, "Can you tell me what happened?"</p><p></p><p>"What happened? That's simple! I, Grandpa Turtle, just didn't like him and killed him, that's all!" </p><p></p><p>The old turtle's face was filled with mockery. What a joke, killing a person - how could he, an existence like him, explain it to these insignificant ants!</p><p></p><p>Killing was nothing extraordinary!</p><p></p><p>The crowd shuddered, looking at the old turtle with horror. Outrageous, utterly outrageous!</p><p></p><p>At this time, the fifth attendant's expression changed, and he secretly transmitted something to Zhu Qiang.</p><p></p><p>Zhu Qiang's gaze sharpened as he stared at the old turtle and said, "A few days ago, someone underwent tribulation at my Tianrun Trading Company. Was that Daoist friend you?"</p><p></p><p>"I did send five or six attendants that day to check on the situation, but I don't think they did anything to you, Daoist friend. Are you here today to seek revenge for that?"</p><p></p><p>Zhu Qiang's voice had become somewhat low. He had thought the other party was here to cause trouble because of the tribulation incident a few days ago.</p><p></p><p>He hadn't acted immediately because he was a thorough businessman!</p><p></p><p>To provoke a Transcendent Immortal Cultivator over a single attendant would be extremely unwise in his eyes.</p><p></p><p>The old turtle was about to say something, but Gu Helin mustered his courage and stepped forward.</p><p></p><p>He knew it was impossible to get the Elder Turtle to explain, so he had to do it himself. He really didn't want the misunderstanding to escalate and cause more casualties. That was just his nature.</p><p></p><p>"President Zhu, it was actually your attendant who said the teleportation array was broken, causing this incident. I just want to ask if it really was broken?"</p><p></p><p>As soon as Gu Helin finished speaking, he was slapped to the ground by the old turtle, who sternly said, "You talk too much. What explanation is needed?"</p><p></p><p>Gu Helin's mouth corner bled as he got up and silently retreated.</p><p></p><p>The old turtle's brow furrowed, and he sighed inwardly.</p><p></p><p>At this time, Zhu Qiang's expression changed slightly. He hadn't expected there to be such a backstory!</p><p></p><p>His mind was always sharp, and in just a moment, he understood the whole situation.</p><p></p><p>It must be that the sixth attendant was dissatisfied with the incident a few days ago, and then recognized the people in front of him, so he deliberately caused trouble... and in the end...</p><p></p><p>Zhu Qiang's face broke into a forced smile as he looked at the old turtle, then at Chu Xiruo, and finally at the blue-robed man sitting there like a detached observer. His heart shuddered, and he took a deep breath and apologetically said,</p><p></p><p>"I'm sorry, fellow Daoists. Today's incident was the fault of my Tianrun Trading Company's attendant, and he has also died. You have had your revenge. Let's just let this matter go, shall we?"</p><p></p><p>"President!!!" </p><p></p><p>Hearing this, the crowd of attendants' faces changed drastically, filled with a chill beyond words!</p>

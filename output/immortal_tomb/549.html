        <div class="content">
            <p>Here is the full English translation of the Chinese excerpt:</p><p></p><p>After Yin Quan returned to the Daozhen Sect, he summoned the elders to begin arranging various matters.</p><p></p><p>When the elders heard Yin Quan say that he wanted to eliminate the Tianwu Sect and that they would act in two days, they were stunned!</p><p></p><p>Ah? Is this so hasty?</p><p></p><p>Sect Master! Our Daozhen Sect is not weak, but compared to the Tianwu Sect, there is still a considerable gap!</p><p></p><p>Yin Quan immediately scolded the elders for being unambitious, and then spoke of the alliance with the Beidou Academy!</p><p></p><p>The elders immediately became energized, their gaze changing from panic to eager anticipation.</p><p></p><p>Ally with the Beidou Academy? That will definitely work out!</p><p></p><p>After all, the Beidou Academy is no ordinary place. As the only academy of the Xinglo Empire that specializes in the Dao of the Brush, it has stood firm against the oppression of the Tianwu Sect for all these years, which is enough to prove its worth.</p><p></p><p>But, Sect Master, won't we be criticized by others for the alliance between the Martial Dao Sect and the Brush Dao?</p><p></p><p>Yin Quan immediately understood the elders' concerns, and angrily reprimanded them:</p><p></p><p>"At a time like this, are you still concerned about what others think? Now the Tianwu Sect has united with the other sects to target our Daozhen Sect!!"</p><p></p><p>"What? Are you willing to wait to be slaughtered?"</p><p></p><p>"A bunch of useless fools!"</p><p></p><p>The elders immediately fell silent, quickly leaving to make arrangements.</p><p></p><p>Seeing this, Yin Quan snorted coldly, looking out the hall, his eyes revealing ambition as he murmured:</p><p></p><p>"White General, the Sect Master has been hesitating before, but this time, you have greatly strengthened my determination to ally with Mei Cangwu."</p><p></p><p>"Hehe, the position of the hegemon sect of the Xinglo Empire has been held by the Tianwu Sect for too long, it's time for a change."</p><p></p><p>"White General, all of this is because of you..."</p><p></p><p>The next day.</p><p></p><p>Jixiang Town, Changsheng Academy.</p><p></p><p>After the morning reading, during the first class, Lu Changsheng brought Zui Qianchun in front of the bewildered gaze of Han Yue and the others.</p><p></p><p>Huh... Grandpa Xu?</p><p></p><p>Shouldn't Grandpa Xu be making noodles at this time?</p><p></p><p>What is the teacher bringing Grandpa Xu to the academy for?</p><p></p><p>"Starting today, Old Xu will be the assistant teacher in my Changsheng Academy," Lu Changsheng said with a smile.</p><p></p><p>Ah? Assistant teacher?</p><p></p><p>Han Yue and the others were dumbfounded.</p><p></p><p>Lu Changsheng didn't say anything else, just turned and left, directly handing over the class to Zui Qianchun.</p><p></p><p>Zui Qianchun was stunned, looking at Lu Changsheng's retreating back, wanting to say something but unable to.</p><p></p><p>Teacher, you said you wanted me to be the assistant, so why are you leaving like a free-handed boss?</p><p></p><p>Sigh.</p><p></p><p>After Lu Changsheng left, Han Yue and the others also immediately relaxed. They curiously looked at Zui Qianchun.</p><p></p><p>"Grandpa Xu, why are you here? The teacher said you're the assistant teacher, he must be joking, right?"</p><p></p><p>"Yes, Grandpa Xu still has the noodle shop to run."</p><p></p><p>"..."</p><p></p><p>The three of them spoke one after another, their words quite implicit.</p><p></p><p>Regarding these words, Zui Qianchun just smiled, and then suddenly acted surprised:</p><p></p><p>"Oh? I didn't expect you three to already have a source of ink within you, not bad, not bad. Teacher Lu's vision is exceptional, you three little fellows are indeed good seedlings for the Dao of the Brush."</p><p></p><p>As soon as the words fell, Han Yue and the others were startled, looking at Zui Qianchun with disbelief!</p><p></p><p>Grandpa Xu actually knows about the source of ink? And he could even see that the three of them have a source of ink at a glance?</p><p></p><p>Ah, is this real or not!</p><p></p><p>Han Yue and the others' pupils contracted, feeling that the Grandpa Xu in front of them had become so unfamiliar.</p><p></p><p>It doesn't match the kind-hearted Grandpa Xu at all.</p><p></p><p>No wonder... No wonder the teacher made Grandpa Xu the assistant teacher, the teacher must have his own reasons.</p><p></p><p>It turns out Grandpa Xu has been hiding so deeply!</p><p></p><p>He's actually also a brush cultivator!</p><p></p><p>And obviously, a rather powerful brush cultivator!</p><p></p><p>"Grandpa... Grandpa Xu, so your noodle shop is not open anymore?" Ye Xiaoxiao asked softly.</p><p></p><p>"Two things don't interfere with each other," Zui Qianchun casually said without further explanation, and then solemnly said, "Then let's prepare for the class. From now on, you can still call me Grandpa Xu."</p><p></p><p>"Okay..."</p><p></p><p>Han Yue and the others answered in a dazed manner, until now, their minds were still a bit muddled.</p><p></p><p>How did Grandpa Xu, the noodle seller, suddenly become a powerful brush cultivator?</p><p></p><p>Meanwhile, as Lu Changsheng arrived at the entrance of the Changsheng Academy, he saw the Cao family father and son standing there.</p><p></p><p>Seeing this, Cao Yulong hurriedly led his son and...</p><p></p><p>Here is the full English translation of the Chinese excerpt:</p><p></p><p>Cao Boyu stepped forward and bowed, "Mr. Lu, I... I know this must be very troublesome for you, but I still beseech you to give my son a chance."</p><p></p><p>Cao Boyu then directly knelt down and prostrated himself, "I beg you, Mr. Lu, to give Boyu a chance. Boyu will work hard in the future, focus on his studies, and not bring disgrace to you!"</p><p></p><p>The passersby who witnessed this scene all had their hearts skip a beat, and they looked at Lu Changsheng with reverence before quickly leaving the area.</p><p></p><p>Lu Changsheng looked at Cao Yulong and after a moment said, "This is the third time. Judging from the Magistrate's attitude, if I don't accept your son, he will come to obstruct me every day..."</p><p></p><p>Cao Yulong's heart trembled, and he became fearful, hastily saying, "No, I dare not! If this time Mr. Lu still does not wish to accept Boyu, then I... I will not bring Boyu to disturb you again."</p><p></p><p>"Mm, then you may leave," Lu Changsheng said indifferently, brushing past Cao Boyu and disappearing down the street.</p><p></p><p>Cao Yulong stood there dazed for a while, finally letting out a long sigh, seeming to have aged several years.</p><p></p><p>"Rui'er, let's go."</p><p></p><p>Cao Yulong stepped forward to take Cao Boyu's hand, but Cao Boyu's hand retreated behind him as he lowered his head and said softly, "Father, the sun will rise soon and it will be very hot. You should go back first."</p><p></p><p>Cao Yulong was taken aback, instinctively asking, "What do you mean?"</p><p></p><p>"As you've told me before, success is in one's own hands. I... I don't want to give up yet."</p><p></p><p>Cao Boyu looked at the ground, speaking dejectedly.</p><p></p><p>Cao Yulong's pupils shrank, and then an unprecedented sense of contentment appeared on his face.</p><p></p><p>His child had become so sensible. Even if Mr. Lu still did not accept him, he would no longer feel regretful. With this temperament, his future achievements would not be too poor.</p><p></p><p>"Alright! Then Father will go back."</p><p></p><p>Cao Yulong smiled, looked up at the gradually rising sun, then glanced at Cao Boyu's knees, a look of pity flashing in his eyes, and he sighed lightly before turning and leaving.</p><p></p><p>...</p><p></p><p>The sun rose higher.</p><p></p><p>In front of the Changsheng Academy, Cao Boyu's small body swayed unsteadily, drenched in sweat, his face and lips pale.</p><p></p><p>His knees hurt, a piercing pain.</p><p></p><p>As the young master of the Magistrate's mansion, he had never experienced such suffering before.</p><p></p><p>Cao Boyu had almost given up several times, but when he thought of Huang Xuan, Han Yue, Ye Xiaoxiao, Xiao Fan and the others, he gritted his teeth and persevered.</p><p></p><p>He, Cao Boyu, was no inferior to anyone!</p><p></p><p>More and more passersby stopped at the academy gate, their gazes filled with both worry and empathy as they looked at the young master Cao Boyu.</p><p></p><p>This couldn't go on, he might even die at this rate, after all, he was just over ten years old!</p><p></p><p>The townspeople were anxious, repeatedly trying to persuade him.</p><p></p><p>But at this moment, Cao Boyu couldn't hear them at all, completely immersed in his own world, a world that was gradually spinning.</p><p></p><p>His knees were completely numb, and his strength was exhausted.</p><p></p><p>Just then, Lu Changsheng returned carrying a bag of fruits. The townspeople were delighted, like seeing a savior, but they didn't dare say anything, only looking at him hopefully.</p><p></p><p>Lu Changsheng didn't even glance at Cao Boyu, walking straight towards the academy.</p><p></p><p>Suddenly, there was a "bang" sound.</p><p></p><p>Lu Changsheng stopped in his tracks.</p><p></p><p>Because a small hand had grabbed the hem of his pants.</p><p></p><p>Cao Boyu had collapsed to the ground, tightly clutching Lu Changsheng's pant leg, hoarsely pleading, "Sir... please..."</p><p></p><p>Lu Changsheng looked back and smiled, "You're the first one to grab my pants."</p><p></p><p>Cao Boyu trembled and let go of his grip.</p><p></p><p>"Come to the academy to audit the class tomorrow, and we'll see how you perform."</p><p></p><p>Lu Changsheng said, then tossed a fruit precisely into Cao Boyu's hand before entering the academy.</p><p></p><p>Cao Boyu just lay on the ground, staring dazedly at the fruit in his hand, his eyes brimming with tears, his vision gradually blurring.</p><p></p><p>Soon, his eyes closed, and he passed out.</p><p></p><p>But the fruit was still tightly gripped in his unconscious hand, as if letting go would mean losing this hard-won opportunity.</p>

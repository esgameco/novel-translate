        <h1>Chapter 167</h1>
        <div class="content">
            <p>Here is the full English translation of the Chinese excerpt:</p><p></p><p>The language was calm, yet it was earth-shattering, with a hint of hidden arrogance.</p><p></p><p>The mighty should be indifferent to all, their hearts like still waters.</p><p></p><p>But who said the mighty are not allowed to be arrogant?</p><p></p><p>When it's time to be arrogant, then be arrogant. Lu Changsheng has never restrained himself, letting his heart be as it wishes.</p><p></p><p>What's wrong with being wild and unrestrained?</p><p></p><p>He has the capital for it.</p><p></p><p>Although he's not sure how powerful he is exactly, as an immortal, he will undoubtedly become the sole undefeatable one in the world as time goes by!</p><p></p><p>"Clang—"</p><p></p><p>The sword qi surged, slashing with unparalleled speed!</p><p></p><p>Jiang Chu and the others turned deathly pale.</p><p></p><p>At this moment, a bronze mirror flew out from Jiang Chu, emitting incomparable rainbow-colored light when it trembled!</p><p></p><p>Countless rainbow-colored beams instantly wove into a thick defensive barrier!</p><p></p><p>Jiang Chu and the others had not even had the chance to rejoice...</p><p></p><p>Clang!</p><p></p><p>The defense was instantly shattered and dispersed by the fierce sword qi.</p><p></p><p>The bronze mirror also shattered abruptly.</p><p></p><p>Sizzle! Sizzle! Sizzle! Sizzle!</p><p></p><p>The sword qi swept past, and the four people's heads fell to the ground.</p><p></p><p>Four red beams emerged from the dantian of the corpses, trying to flee, but were instantly caught up by the sword qi!</p><p></p><p>"Ahhhhh!!!"</p><p></p><p>The chilling screams forcibly yanked the bystanders out of their daze, making their skin crawl.</p><p></p><p>Suddenly, the screams abruptly stopped, and the sword qi dissipated, leaving the surroundings quiet.</p><p></p><p>Lu Changsheng stood still, then suddenly looked up at the sky.</p><p></p><p>The onlookers were slightly taken aback, as if they had sensed something, and hastily looked up at the azure sky!</p><p></p><p>Only to see the sky filled with surging clouds, with the deep azure sky faintly visible amidst the vast clouds!</p><p></p><p>The next moment, the vast cloud mass formed a giant face with five features!</p><p></p><p>Compared to this, the onlookers were like ants!</p><p></p><p>"Daring to kill my Jiang clan imperial clan members... Very good," the giant face in the sky spoke.</p><p></p><p>The onlookers were dumbfounded, staring at the giant cloud face in the sky, speechless.</p><p></p><p>At the same time, Left Chou Shan was stubbornly lowering his head, his eyes bloodshot and silent!!!</p><p></p><p>This voice... was engraved in his bones!</p><p></p><p>"Father..." Left Qi Ran noticed Left Chou Shan's abnormality.</p><p></p><p>Left Chou Shan gritted his teeth and remained silent.</p><p></p><p>"So you can't kill the people of my Jiang clan imperial clan?" Lu Changsheng casually waved his sleeve, smiling indifferently, "If I killed them, then so be it. What can you do about it?"</p><p></p><p>"Arrogant and ignorant," the giant face in the sky said coldly.</p><p></p><p>Lu Changsheng smiled and lightly waved his sleeve.</p><p></p><p>Suddenly, the heads of Jiang Chu and Jiang Chong levitated and flew out, finally hanging high above the entrance of Qingxuan Town.</p><p></p><p>"I've stepped on the face of your Jiang clan imperial clan," Lu Changsheng said indifferently, his hands clasped behind his back.</p><p></p><p>Peng Fang, Left Chou Shan, Su Qianghe, and all the others present were stunned for a moment, their gazes fixed on the slender figure in blue, their heartbeats suddenly accelerating, instantly infected!</p><p></p><p>Thump thump thump thump...!</p><p></p><p>Their hearts had never been so erratic before!</p><p></p><p>Excitement, exhilaration, madness, shock, incredulity, all were present, their nerves more tense than ever before!</p><p></p><p>For countless years, the Black Demon Domain has never lacked ruthless and crazy people!</p><p></p><p>But to openly declare stepping on the face of the imperial clan...</p><p></p><p>Such a ruthless and crazy person, until now, has been the first!</p><p></p><p>How could they not be exhilarated, and how could they not be shocked?</p><p></p><p>They were originally people of the Black Demon Domain, with madness engraved in their bones.</p><p></p><p>The vast, empty eyes of the giant face in the sky seemed to have withdrawn their gaze from the direction of the town gate, and after a moment of silence, it suddenly burst into laughter.</p><p></p><p>"Hahaha... Impressive courage! But if you think you can have such confidence just by killing two of my Jiang clan imperial clan members... You are truly arrogant and ignorant!"</p><p></p><p>With that, the vast cloud mass began to violently churn!</p><p></p><p>Forming into a giant hand, the five fingers spread wide, and it slammed down towards Qingxuan Town with great force!</p><p></p><p>Whoosh whoosh whoosh—</p><p></p><p>In an instant, the mountains and rivers trembled, and a hurricane raged through Qingxuan Town!</p><p></p><p>The cultivators steadied their footing and looked up at the descending giant hand with great difficulty. This giant hand was extremely large, and the terrifying power within it made their hearts freeze with fear. If it were to slam down, the entire Qingxuan Town might be reduced to rubble.</p><p></p><p>Here is the full English translation of the Chinese excerpt:</p><p></p><p>Powder!!</p><p></p><p>New 69 Book Bar 69shux.com</p><p></p><p>The Jiang Clan, truly terrifying!</p><p></p><p>The casters of the spells did not know how far they were from Qingxuan Town, yet they unleashed such a terrifying attack!</p><p></p><p>Peng Fang's eyes narrowed slightly, and he was about to move, but out of the corner of his eye, he saw Lu Changsheng suddenly throw a light punch into the sky...</p><p></p><p>As soon as the punch was unleashed, the huge palm that slapped down was shattered into mist by the shockwave of the punch!!</p><p></p><p>The sky and earth hummed, and the space vibration became more and more fierce.</p><p></p><p>"You..." </p><p></p><p>The giant face in the sky fell silent for a moment, then said, "You do have some skills, no wonder you are so arrogant. If I were here in my true form, I would have made sure you had no place to be buried!"</p><p></p><p>As he spoke, as if a little anxious, the giant face in the sky began to loosen, wanting to transform back into clouds.</p><p></p><p>Seeing this, Lu Changsheng smiled and said, "Since you've come, shouldn't you pay a price?"</p><p></p><p>The sky, the invisible shockwave of the punch, slammed fiercely towards the giant face!</p><p></p><p>Boom!</p><p></p><p>The giant face was suddenly scattered!!</p><p></p><p>Only a cold and unwilling voice echoed.</p><p></p><p>"You! Wait for it...!"</p><p></p><p>After a moment, the wind stopped, and the sky turned clear.</p><p></p><p>Outside the Long Sheng Tavern, the crowd stood as if petrified, still in shock, unable to recover for a long time.</p><p></p><p>Lu Changsheng swept his gaze around and said mildly, "No one is allowed to cause trouble on my tavern's territory. The Jiang Clan Imperial Family is like that, and so are you. Understand?"</p><p></p><p>The crowd of cultivators suddenly snapped to attention, nodding their heads frantically like crazy chickens pecking at the ground, though they were all fierce people, they looked unusually obedient at the moment.</p><p></p><p>Seeing this, Lu Changsheng nodded slightly, then turned and walked back into the tavern.</p><p></p><p>Peng Fang, Left Chou Shan, Left Qi Ran and the others hurriedly bowed and scattered to the sides, making a wide path for Lu Changsheng to pass through.</p><p></p><p>Lu Changsheng walked through the crowd of admiring gazes, stopped at the entrance of the courtyard, and suddenly said, "Restore order."</p><p></p><p>Then he stepped into the courtyard and disappeared.</p><p></p><p>Seeing this, the crowd finally let out a heavy sigh of relief.</p><p></p><p>Everyone's expressions were still fearful, shocked, and somewhat dreamlike.</p><p></p><p>The boss... is too strong.</p><p></p><p>Everyone in their hearts knew that this... was just the beginning.</p><p></p><p>The incident would continue to ferment, and a great storm from the Jiang Clan Imperial Family would soon arrive.</p><p></p><p>Perhaps not only the Jiang Clan Imperial Family, but the lord of the Black Abyss Domain might also be alarmed by this matter.</p><p></p><p>But one thing was undeniable.</p><p></p><p>That is, the Long Sheng Tavern in their Qingxuan Town would be known throughout the Black Abyss Domain, and even the Heavenly Scar, at an extremely terrifying speed!!</p><p></p><p>Along with their Qingxuan Town...</p><p></p><p>Thinking of this, the crowd was greatly excited, their Qingxuan Town would also rise to fame along with the boss's Long Sheng Tavern.</p><p></p><p>However, some cultivators were also vaguely worried about Lu Changsheng, after all, the Jiang Clan Imperial Family has such deep roots...</p><p></p><p>"Ahem, senior."</p><p></p><p>Left Chou Shan bowed and called out to Peng Fang.</p><p></p><p>With Lu Changsheng gone, this nameless fat man was the strongest now.</p><p></p><p>Peng Fang glanced at him and lazily returned to the rocking chair in the distance.</p><p></p><p>Seeing this, Left Chou Shan felt a little relieved in his heart, straightened up, and shouted at the crowd in a low voice, "What are you all still looking at?! Didn't you hear the boss just now say to restore order?"</p><p></p><p>Suddenly, the crowd here trembled, all bowing towards the Long Sheng Tavern, then silently leaving one by one.</p><p></p><p>Soon, the outside of the Long Sheng Tavern became empty, leaving only the distant Peng Fang lying in his own chair and the queue of cultivators.</p><p></p><p>"Qi Ran, Elder, you should also return to the Heavenly Snake Manor, the lord is on duty now," Left Chou Shan stood upright at the door, not looking sideways as he ordered.</p><p></p><p>"Uh, yes."</p><p></p><p>The people of the Heavenly Snake Manor were about to leave.</p><p></p><p>Left Chou Shan suddenly said again, "Find Left You, he should not have fled Qingxuan Town too far yet, and when you find him... kill him."</p><p></p><p>At the same time,</p><p></p><p>In the Heavenly Scar, the Holy Immortal Domain, in the Jiang Clan Imperial Family.</p><p></p><p>"Cough, cough..."</p><p></p><p>Jiang Wuji opened his aged eyes, wiped the blood at the corner of his mouth, then looked at the blood on his thumb for a long time, silent and wordless.</p><p></p><p>"Qingxuan Town, Long Sheng Tavern, haha."</p>

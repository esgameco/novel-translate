        <h1>Chapter 539</h1>
        <div class="content">
            <p>Here is the full English translation of the Chinese excerpt:</p><p></p><p>The setting sun had disappeared, and the sky had already darkened.</p><p></p><p>At this moment, a series of hurried footsteps could be heard.</p><p></p><p>A group of people rushed over, carrying torches.</p><p></p><p>The arrivals were the town lord Cao Yulong, his son Cao Boyu, and the accompanying town guards.</p><p></p><p>Under the light of the torches, they quickly spotted Lü Changsheng sitting quietly, the old Xu lying on the ground, and... that pile of meat cubes.</p><p></p><p>The group examined the meat cubes, seeming to have some thoughts, and their faces gradually lost their color, a strange feeling rising in their hearts.</p><p></p><p>Cao Yulong had originally planned to bring his son to find Lü Changsheng today. However, when they went to Changsheng's school, they found it closed again.</p><p></p><p>After some inquiries, they learned that Lü Changsheng and old Xu had come fishing again.</p><p></p><p>Cao Yulong had no choice but to summon some town guards and come out of the town to find Lü Changsheng.</p><p></p><p>Otherwise, day after day, there would be too many tomorrows.</p><p></p><p>Lü Changsheng was too carefree, with no fixed schedule for his daily activities.</p><p></p><p>It wasn't long after Cao Yulong's group left the town when they heard a terrifying scream coming from the direction of the lake!! </p><p></p><p>The scream was so chilling that even from a distance, they were all frightened!</p><p></p><p>But Cao Yulong still gritted his teeth and led the town guards to rush over.</p><p></p><p>Upon arrival, they were met with the scene before them.</p><p></p><p>Everything seemed normal, and the previous terrifying scream almost seemed like a hallucination...</p><p></p><p>Regaining their composure, one of the town guards quickly went to help old Xu up, and seeing that he was still breathing, he heaved a sigh of relief and turned to Cao Yulong, nodding.</p><p></p><p>Cao Yulong's heart and mind were somewhat relieved. He bowed to Lü Changsheng and asked worriedly, "Mr. Lü, are you... are you alright?"</p><p></p><p>Lü Changsheng turned around and smiled, "So it's the town lord. Do I look like I'm in trouble?"</p><p></p><p>Cao Yulong pursed his dry lips, looking at the pile of meat cubes, hesitant to speak.</p><p></p><p>"Those are just some wild animal meat cubes, which I'm using as bait," Lü Changsheng said lightly, then suddenly frowned, "But the area around Jixiang Town isn't safe either. Remember to tell the townspeople not to go out at night."</p><p></p><p>Cao Yulong hurriedly agreed, "Mr. Lü is right, I'll definitely instruct the town when I go back!"</p><p></p><p>As for the wild animal meat cubes...</p><p>Cao Yulong heard the explanation, looked at the pile of meat cubes, and his expression became increasingly unsettled.</p><p>They had had a preposterous idea from the start!</p><p>Could these meat cubes be human flesh?</p><p>However, they quickly dismissed this absurd thought.</p><p>If it were really human flesh, they would have been terrified and unable to stand steady.</p><p>It must be wild animal meat, no doubt. Otherwise, why would the gentle Lü Changsheng chop someone into meat cubes?</p><p>And Lü Changsheng... never mind, this is just wild animal meat.</p><p>As for the previous terrifying screams, the person must have been driven away or killed by Lü Changsheng.</p><p></p><p>Cao Yulong, seeing that Lü Changsheng had turned back to fishing, remembered his original purpose, took a deep breath, and pulled the nervous Cao Boyu forward, his tone both anxious and hopeful, with a hint of pleading,</p><p>"Mr. Lü, I've come here to..."</p><p></p><p>Lü Changsheng interrupted, "To have your son enroll in my school?"</p><p></p><p>"Mr. Lü is truly perceptive. I know my son has been rejected by you before, but I still can't let go. Mr. Lü, could you..."</p><p></p><p>Suddenly, Cao Yulong knelt down.</p><p></p><p>Beside him, Cao Boyu was stunned for a moment, then quickly knelt down as well, his heart filled with shock and gratitude.</p><p>His father had actually knelt down for his future.</p><p></p><p>Cao Boyu bowed his head, feeling increasingly guilty and ashamed of himself. As the son of the town lord, he was truly unworthy.</p><p></p><p>The town guards also trembled, swallowing hard, and one by one knelt down.</p><p>If the town lord had knelt, they as his subordinates had no right to stand.</p><p></p><p>"The sky is getting darker, and it's not safe outside. Go back," Lü Changsheng said without turning his head.</p><p></p><p>Cao Yulong's face was filled with bitterness, and Cao Boyu's body stiffened, his fists clenched, a sour feeling in his heart.</p><p>They had been rejected again...</p><p></p><p>"Yes."</p><p>Cao Yulong took a light breath, and with Cao Boyu's support, stood up and respectfully said, "Then we shall take our leave."</p><p></p><p>Here is the full English translation of the Chinese excerpt:</p><p></p><p>Without disturbing Mr. Lu's leisure, the sky was gradually darkening, and Mr. Lu also remembered to return to the town earlier. </p><p></p><p>"Okay." Lu Changsheng nodded lightly.</p><p></p><p>Soon, Cao's father and son left the lakeside under the escort of the town guards.</p><p></p><p>Of course, the unconscious old Xu was also carried away together.</p><p></p><p>......</p><p></p><p>On the way back to Jixiang Town, Cao Yulong's group was silent.</p><p></p><p>The town guards held torches and vigilantly scanned their surroundings.</p><p></p><p>"Yuer, tomorrow you will follow me to find Mr. Lu again."</p><p></p><p>Cao Yulong suddenly spoke, breaking the silence.</p><p></p><p>Huh?</p><p></p><p>Cao Boyu, who was lost in thought, blinked his eyes, bitterly saying, "Father, maybe we shouldn't, Mr. Lu won't accept me... You saw it today."</p><p></p><p>Cao Yulong frowned and said, "You need to have some perseverance, this is your own future!"</p><p></p><p>"Being rejected twice, and you're already discouraged? No wonder Mr. Lu doesn't think highly of you!!"</p><p></p><p>As he said this, Cao Yulong's tone became more severe, full of disappointment.</p><p></p><p>Cao Boyu's heart trembled, and he fell silent.</p><p></p><p>A father knows his child best.</p><p></p><p>Seeing this, Cao Yulong sighed, "I know you've been uncomfortable these days, because of Huang Xuan and the others, your heart has become unbalanced, and you've started to doubt yourself. At your age, this is only natural. Not just you, even I feel unwilling."</p><p></p><p>Cao Boyu was stunned, looking up at Cao Yulong, his eyes glistening with tears. His father understood him.</p><p></p><p>"But Yuer, remember, things are in our own hands."</p><p></p><p>Cao Yulong said solemnly.</p><p></p><p>Cao Boyu paused, the discouragement in his eyes dissipated, and he nodded firmly, "Father, I understand!"</p><p></p><p>Seeing that his son had grasped the meaning, Cao Yulong smiled with satisfaction.</p><p></p><p>......</p><p></p><p>The next day.</p><p></p><p>Old Xu's noodle shop was still closed for business, disappointing many customers.</p><p></p><p>They complained that Old Xu was no longer focused on his business.</p><p></p><p>But they were soon shocked to hear that Old Xu's closure was not due to fishing.</p><p></p><p>But because he had fallen ill and was bedridden!</p><p></p><p>Many regular customers of the noodle shop immediately bought some tonics and went to visit.</p><p></p><p>They were also puzzled, how could Old Xu, who had always been in good health, suddenly fall ill?</p><p></p><p>After arranging for Han Yue and the others to have their early morning study, Lu Changsheng followed his usual routine and went out for breakfast.</p><p></p><p>He heard that Old Xu was ill, but his expression did not show any surprise.</p><p></p><p>Afterwards, Lu Changsheng came to a roadside stall and simply had two steamed buns and a bowl of porridge. After that, he walked towards Old Xu's house with his hands behind his back.</p><p></p><p>At the same time, in the Changsheng Academy, Han Yue and the others heard Lu Changsheng's voice, "After the morning study, the first class will be self-study."</p><p></p><p>Han Yue and the others were startled, looking at each other in confusion.</p><p></p><p>......</p><p></p><p>Lu Changsheng soon arrived at Old Xu's house, and in the hands behind his back, he had somehow brought two jars of wine.</p><p></p><p>"Mr. Lu has arrived!"</p><p>"Greetings, Mr. Lu!"</p><p>"Mr. Lu, Old Xu is lying unconscious on the bed, occasionally muttering strange words, and even the doctor is at a loss and can't treat the cause of the illness. What are we going to do? Alas!"</p><p>"Old Xu is such a good person, how could this happen to him? Old Xu can't have anything happen to him! Without him, I can't live on!"</p><p></p><p>The crowd spoke one after another, all making way for Lu Changsheng.</p><p></p><p>Huh?</p><p></p><p>Soon, the crowd saw the two jars of wine behind Lu Changsheng's back, and they were all puzzled, but they thought Lu Changsheng must have bought them for himself, so they let it go.</p><p></p><p>But when Lu Changsheng gently placed the two jars of wine on Old Xu's bedside, the crowd was dumbfounded.</p><p></p><p>Wow!</p><p></p><p>They had never seen someone visiting a sick person bring wine as a gift!</p><p></p><p>Is this some kind of stimulation?</p><p></p><p>Is Mr. Lu afraid that Old Xu is not dying fast enough?</p><p></p><p>And Old Xu doesn't even drink wine! In all these years, they've never seen Old Xu touch a drop of alcohol!</p>

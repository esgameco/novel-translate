        <h1>Chapter 522</h1>
        <div class="content">
            <p>Here is the full English translation of the Chinese excerpt:</p><p></p><p>Lu Changsheng glanced sideways and saw a middle-aged man in brocade robes, who had a rather avuncular air, staring at him in astonishment. </p><p></p><p>Behind the middle-aged man was a group of servants, who were also shocked to see him, but quickly lowered their heads, deeply bowing, almost touching their foreheads to the floor.</p><p></p><p>The lord had previously warned the entire clan that when encountering Mr. Lu of the Changsheng Academy in this auspicious town, they must perform a bow of over 90 degrees. As for kneeling, the lord said that would startle Mr. Lu.</p><p></p><p>"Elder Huang, what a coincidence."</p><p></p><p>Lu Changsheng smiled.</p><p></p><p>This Huang Yulang was the clan leader of one of the three major families in Auspicious Town.</p><p></p><p>Compared to the ancient clans Lu Changsheng had encountered before, this small family was as insignificant as dust, no, it was completely incomparable.</p><p></p><p>But in this Auspicious Town, it was also a major power, sharing the rule of the town with the Prefect's Office.</p><p></p><p>However, the three families and the Prefect's Office in Auspicious Town did not engage in any oppression or exploitation, and they even frequently held grand events, getting along well with the common people, so they had a very good reputation.</p><p></p><p>Over the years, the three families had almost no disputes. Even if the three clan leaders had some tensions, it was just verbal sparring, and they never resorted to major confrontations, so they never involved others.</p><p></p><p>As for the Prefect's Office, it had managed this Auspicious Town quite well.</p><p></p><p>Auspicious Town was indeed very auspicious. </p><p></p><p>The townspeople living in this small town had a rather high happiness index.</p><p></p><p>Of course, the most important thing was that the Huang Yulang in front of him was the father of one of his students.</p><p></p><p>"Mr. Lu, you, you, you..."</p><p></p><p>Huang Yulang stepped forward, bowing slightly and stammering a bit.</p><p></p><p>He had just come out of a private room and saw Lu Changsheng sitting by the corridor, which truly startled, frightened, and delighted him.</p><p></p><p>Huang Yulang, true to his name. The townspeople of Auspicious Town called him the Jade-faced Lord, of course, only daring to tease him in private, and only the other two clan leaders would openly tease him.</p><p></p><p>As a clan leader, Huang Yulang was often in and out of flower houses and brothels, scrambling and struggling.</p><p></p><p>Cough, cough, the most important thing was that the few brothels in Auspicious Town, including the Qiuqing Pavilion, were all Huang Yulang's properties.</p><p></p><p>The Qiuqing Pavilion was the largest, while the other two were smaller in scale, but they were also fully booked every day.</p><p></p><p>In the corridor, some guests and ladies saw Huang Yulang's cautious manner towards Lu Changsheng and were not surprised, as they had known a month ago that Lu Changsheng was no ordinary person.</p><p></p><p>However, they still felt deeply moved, wondering just what kind of extraordinary person Mr. Lu was.</p><p></p><p>Fortunately, Mr. Lu was kind-hearted and amiable, making people feel close to him.</p><p></p><p>The madam had just brought over a few pots of wine, but when she saw Huang Yulang, she quietly stood to the side, bowing and waiting.</p><p></p><p>This was her boss.</p><p></p><p>"Care to sit down and have a drink?"</p><p></p><p>Lu Changsheng did not say much, but just gestured with his chin.</p><p></p><p>"Ah, yes, yes."</p><p></p><p>Huang Yulang quickly took the wine pot from the madam's hand, filled Lu Changsheng's cup, and then sat down at the small table, pouring a cup for himself.</p><p></p><p>"Hehe, hehe..."</p><p></p><p>He then sat there, smiling nervously.</p><p></p><p>This manner of his made the others suppress their laughter, but they also did not dare to look up.</p><p></p><p>Huang Yulang sensed something was off and cleared his throat, "Ahem, you all may return to the clan, I'll go back on my own later. Madam, you may also withdraw."</p><p></p><p>The servants and the madam quickly bowed and left the building.</p><p></p><p>"Elder Huang seems quite comfortable, much more so than me." Lu Changsheng took a sip of his wine.</p><p></p><p>Huang Yulang's face flushed red. "Mr. Lu, how can you say that. This is hardly comfort for me..."</p><p></p><p>Huang Yulang was very embarrassed, for the person in front of him was no ordinary man.</p><p></p><p>Recalling that day, the three clan leaders were drinking at the Prefect's Office.</p><p></p><p>This gentleman had descended from the heavens and casually said, "I want to open a school in this town. Who dares to oppose me?"</p><p></p><p>Here is the full English translation of the Chinese excerpt:</p><p></p><p>He descended from the heavens, exuding an aura of grandeur that was overwhelming. Who would dare to oppose him?</p><p></p><p>So they hurriedly bowed and curtsied to the Magistrate.</p><p></p><p>They expressed that the gentleman wished to open a school, and he could open as many as he wanted, and if the gentleman felt it was not enough, they could even help him dismantle the other schools in the town.</p><p></p><p>From then on, they knew that this gentleman possessed unparalleled scholarly elegance and a captivating demeanor - he must be the legendary Master of the Dao of Literature!</p><p></p><p>Although they did not know why the Master of the Dao of Literature had come to Jixiang Town, that was no longer their concern. Their only thought was to send their children to study under this great master!</p><p></p><p>Unfortunately, in the end, only Huang Yulang was accepted, while the children of the other two clan leaders, including the Magistrate's family, were all rejected.</p><p></p><p>As a result, Huang Yulang now enjoyed a favorable position among the other two clan leaders and even the Magistrate.</p><p></p><p>"Hah, your children are not good enough, only my Huang's offspring can make the cut!"</p><p></p><p>Later, they realized that Lu Changsheng merely wanted to establish a school, and in all other aspects, he did not have the airs of a great master at all, but was very amiable.</p><p></p><p>Of course, except for that day when he first arrived, displaying his unparalleled and overbearing manner. That day was deeply etched in their minds.</p><p></p><p>That bearing, that grandeur, was undoubtedly that of a titan.</p><p></p><p>Huang Yulang cleared his throat and cautiously asked, "Master Lu, I wonder how my son has been performing in your school?"</p><p></p><p>After saying this, he hastily added, "If that wretched child is disobedient, Master, please punish him severely! His punishment will be on me!"</p><p></p><p>"......"</p><p></p><p>Lu Changsheng was silent for a moment, then said, "It's not that serious, Huanxuan's overall performance has been quite good."</p><p></p><p>Huang Yulang let out a sigh of relief: "That's good, that's good."</p><p></p><p>After that, the two men fell silent. Lu Changsheng sipped his wine and listened to the music, immersed in contentment.</p><p></p><p>Huang Yulang carefully accompanied him, occasionally glancing at Lu Changsheng with admiration and gratitude.</p><p></p><p>Master Lu is truly a Master of the Dao of Literature, unique and extraordinary. He is not at all comparable to the ordinary schoolteachers in the town.</p><p></p><p>Xuan'er's good fortune to be accepted as his disciple is a great blessing.</p><p></p><p>Huang Yulang had a premonition that perhaps their Huang family could also produce a cultivator of the Dao of Literature.</p><p></p><p>Although in the current times, the Dao of Literature has declined compared to the Martial Dao, but it all depends on who the guide is!</p><p></p><p>With Master Lu as Xuan'er's guide, Huang Yulang felt at ease, reassured, and confident.</p><p></p><p>Perhaps in the entire Jixiang Town, only the three clan leaders and the Magistrate know that the schoolteacher at Changsheng Academy is a Master of the Dao of Literature.</p><p></p><p>The parents of the other fourteen students at Changsheng Academy may still think their children have entered just an ordinary school.</p><p></p><p>Little do they know, they have stepped into the realm of the Dao of Literature!</p><p></p><p>The other schools in the town are merely ordinary schools, only able to lay a foundation for their children to potentially enter a sect of the Dao of Literature in the future.</p><p></p><p>But Changsheng Academy, its teacher is directly a cultivator of the Dao of Literature!</p><p></p><p>The difference is like heaven and earth!</p><p></p><p>Lu Changsheng stayed at the Qiuqing Pavilion until the hour of the Ox, then stood up and stretched, preparing to leave.</p><p></p><p>The dozing Huang Yulang quickly got up: "Master Lu, let me escort you back to Changsheng Academy."</p><p></p><p>"No need," Lu Changsheng replied with a faint smile, then placed a gold coin on the table.</p><p></p><p>This single gold coin was enough to cover the expenses for everyone tonight.</p><p></p><p>"Master! You've come to my place, how could I accept your money, and this is too much...!"</p><p></p><p>Huang Yulang stared blankly at the gold coin, but when he quickly looked up, Lu Changsheng's figure had already disappeared.</p>

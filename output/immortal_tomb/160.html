        <h1>Chapter 160</h1>
        <div class="content">
            <p>Here is the full English translation of the excerpt from the Chinese novel:</p><p></p><p>For some reason, Peng Fang always felt that there was more to what Lu Changsheng was saying, but no matter how hard he tried, he just couldn't figure it out, so he decided to let it go. üçë ‚ãÜ üç≠üéÄùü®ùü´ùìàùíΩùìäùìç.ùí∏‚òØùìÇüéÄüç≠ ‚ãÜ üçë</p><p></p><p>He bowed and smiled, "Proprietor, there is a brothel in the town called the Red Boudoir, and I've heard they recently recruited a new top courtesan. She is said to be stunningly beautiful and proficient in all the arts - music, chess, calligraphy, and painting. She..."</p><p></p><p>Lu Changsheng interrupted him with a smile and a wave of his hand, "I don't have much interest in such things. No matter how captivating or exquisite a woman may be, in the grand scheme of time, she will ultimately become just a handful of earth."</p><p></p><p>Peng Fang paused, chuckling awkwardly. He didn't expect Lu Changsheng to be someone who was not interested in women, and his level of cultivation truly seemed quite high.</p><p></p><p>As for himself, even though he had reached the Immortal Emperor realm, he still enjoyed the pleasures of wine and women. He admitted that he was a man of the mundane world.</p><p></p><p>Lu Changsheng glanced at him, fully aware of his thoughts, and lightly laughed, "It's not that I'm refined, I'm also a man of the mundane world, but how one defines one's mundaneness is up to oneself."</p><p></p><p>"Well said, Proprietor," Peng Fang replied with a bow and a smile.</p><p></p><p>Lu Changsheng nodded slightly and walked on, hands behind his back.</p><p></p><p>Peng Fang sighed inwardly, finding himself increasingly unable to see through the Proprietor of the Longevity Inn. His gaze flickered, and he followed along, feeling a bit conflicted. "Proprietor, if you don't indulge in women, then what about wine? The ones they brew at the Red Boudoir can't be as good as the soul-cleansing brew in your inn, so..."</p><p></p><p>"Then go to the Red Boudoir," Lu Changsheng said.</p><p></p><p>"Huh?" Peng Fang was puzzled.</p><p></p><p>"Hehe..." Lu Changsheng shook his head and chuckled lightly, "I said I don't have much interest, not that I have no interest at all. So... going to watch a dance performance shouldn't be too much, right?"</p><p></p><p>Peng Fang's expression became solemn as he bowed, "That's quite reasonable, in fact."</p><p></p><p>"Then let's go in," Lu Changsheng turned and smiled.</p><p></p><p>Peng Fang was taken aback, and when he turned his head to look, he was shocked to find that they had already arrived at the Red Boudoir!</p><p></p><p>Just a moment ago, there was still quite a distance, but how did they get here so quickly?</p><p></p><p>What happened? </p><p></p><p>He was the one being led here by Lu Changsheng, and he didn't even notice?</p><p></p><p>Peng Fang was immediately alarmed.</p><p></p><p>He watched the retreating figure of the man in the green robe entering the establishment, and his throat felt a bit constricted. He had greatly underestimated Lu Changsheng, it seemed.</p><p></p><p>Then, was his previous tone and manner not respectful enough?</p><p></p><p>Lu Changsheng had become even more unfathomable in Peng Fang's eyes. At the very least, through that stealthy and undetectable movement just now, he knew that Lu Changsheng was far stronger than him, and not just a little bit.</p><p></p><p>"Proprietor, wait."</p><p></p><p>Peng Fang snapped out of his thoughts, took a light breath, and hurried to follow.</p><p></p><p>"Hey, did you guys notice the green-robed man who just went in? Isn't he the Proprietor of the Longevity Inn?"</p><p></p><p>"Tch, notice? How could we not? That green-robed man is none other than the Proprietor of the Longevity Inn himself!"</p><p></p><p>"The Proprietor of the Longevity Inn is usually holed up in the inn, but today he's actually come out to play?"</p><p></p><p>"Hehe, the Proprietor always seems so pure and untainted, but he's actually come to the Red Boudoir. What a man of the world he is! I'm going in to join the Proprietor too."</p><p></p><p>"Spread the word, the Proprietor of the Longevity Inn has gone to the Red Boudoir!"</p><p></p><p>"..."</p><p></p><p>Outside the Red Boudoir, there was suddenly a flurry of discussion among the cultivators. Their eyes gleamed with excitement, and their gossiping hearts were ablaze.</p><p></p><p>It didn't take long before the news spread like wildfire.</p><p></p><p>Meanwhile, inside the Red Boudoir, it was a completely different world from the outside.</p><p></p><p>Here is the full English translation of the Chinese excerpt:</p><p></p><p>After all, the Black Sha Domain was not a place for ordinary people, but only for cultivators. Even the owners of the various shops, restaurants, and brothels were all cultivators. </p><p></p><p>So they all had the support of expansion array formations. As soon as one entered this Red Boudoir Garden, the field of vision before their eyes was extremely broad, far more expansive than it appeared from the outside.</p><p></p><p>Soft zither music resounded in the ears, with coquettish laughter and soft murmurs. </p><p></p><p>What met the eyes was a hazy mist, colorful and beautiful, with enchanting and charming figures coming and going endlessly, as if one had been transported to a immortal realm.</p><p></p><p>"Haha, good! The dancing is really excellent, bravo!" </p><p></p><p>Suddenly, a burst of loud laughter rang out.</p><p></p><p>Lu Changsheng, with his hands behind his back, followed the sound of laughter and walked through the mist.</p><p></p><p>Peng Fang hurriedly followed after rubbing his hands, his gaze sweeping around. He felt a bit displeased, as there was usually someone to receive guests when entering the Red Boudoir Garden, but today there was no one.</p><p></p><p>How impolite.</p><p></p><p>Lu Changsheng and Peng Fang arrived at the source of the laughter. As the mist dissipated, they saw hundreds of cultivators gathered, intently watching a solo dance performance on the high stage.</p><p></p><p>Everyone was watching with utmost concentration, not blinking an eye, except for the occasional shouts of praise, perhaps more focused than their usual cultivation.</p><p></p><p>Lu Changsheng looked up and saw a woman in red on the stage, dancing gracefully to the soothing music.</p><p></p><p>She was scantily dressed, and occasionally, due to the large movements of the dance, flashes of her pale skin caused many present to suck in a breath.</p><p></p><p>Lu Changsheng also stood there, arms crossed, watching leisurely, just like the others.</p><p></p><p>Peng Fang chuckled, his eyes shining, as the Red Boudoir Garden was the most popular brothel in Qingxuan Town, and the quality was indeed quite good. As an old patron, he had actually never seen this young lady before, indicating that the Red Boudoir Garden updated its performers quite frequently to maintain the freshness for its customers.</p><p></p><p>After a moment, the music stopped, and the woman in red's skirt gradually fell. She slightly bowed towards the audience below.</p><p></p><p>The customers immediately became excited, throwing spirit stones up to her one after another.</p><p></p><p>"Haha, wonderful, the Red Boudoir Garden truly lives up to its name. Miss Red Carp, may I have the honor of spending the night with you? I'm so troubled, I'm down to just spirit stones, with nowhere else to spend them."</p><p></p><p>"Tch, Miss Red Carp should take a look at me instead. My robust build is better than his, I guarantee I can make Miss Red Carp feel good and comfortable."</p><p></p><p>"......"</p><p></p><p>Below the stage, the crowd discussed animatedly, gradually becoming flushed and heated.</p><p></p><p>They were all men, and after just watching the dance, their inner qi was still surging.</p><p></p><p>They even looked ready to come to blows.</p><p></p><p>The woman in red, called Red Carp, smiled and said, "I'm sorry, esteemed guests, but Red Carp is a pure performer, selling her art, not her body."</p><p></p><p>Upon hearing this, the crowd's expressions immediately changed.</p><p></p><p>"In the Black Sha Domain, you've already entered a brothel, and you're still pretending? Where's the madam of the Red Boudoir Garden? Let her come out!"</p><p></p><p>"That's right, this is just putting on airs as a prostitute. Isn't it better if we all have a good time happily? You're really just giving us the cold shoulder."</p><p></p><p>"Madam, come out! If this brothel girl won't entertain customers, then refund the money!"</p><p></p><p>"Qingxuan Town has other brothels besides your Red Boudoir Garden..."</p><p></p><p>The cultivators below were all hot-tempered, and they started criticizing her, their voices growing louder. Attracted by the commotion, more and more cultivators from the Red Boudoir Garden gathered.</p><p></p><p>Red Carp's expression changed slightly. This was her first time performing, and she didn't expect that just by saying that one sentence, it would provoke such resentment.</p><p></p><p>Just earlier, those guests had been completely enchanted and infatuated by her, but now they had turned on her so abruptly.</p>

        <h1>Chapter 125</h1>
        <div class="content">
            <p>Here is the full English translation of the Chinese excerpt:</p><p></p><p>As time passed, üèÜ‚ô§‚ûÖ‚ûàÀ¢ùì±·ªÆùìß.ÔΩÉùëú–º‚òØ‚ôó</p><p></p><p>Chu Lingian, Feng Jiu, and the Old Turtle had already stood in the air at the boundary of the Eastern Immortal Realm, ready for battle!</p><p></p><p>Behind them were the six Immortal Sovereigns of the Eastern and Western Immortal Realms, hundreds of Immortal Kings, thousands of Primordial Immortal Lords, and tens of thousands of Great Transcendent Immortals.</p><p></p><p>It can be said that the vast Eastern Immortal Realm and Western Immortal Realm, all the top combat forces, were gathered here!</p><p></p><p>The momentum was truly grand!</p><p></p><p>Everyone looked at the three figures in front of them with reverence.</p><p></p><p>As for the three Immortal Sovereigns and Immortal Kings of the Central Immortal Realm, they had been sent by the Old Turtle to the relatively weaker Southern Immortal Realm.</p><p></p><p>Chu Lingian glanced outside the boundary, then turned to Feng Jiu and the Old Turtle, signaling, "Feng Jiu, Old Turtle..."</p><p></p><p>Before he could finish, the two of them nodded.</p><p></p><p>Chu Lingian turned around and swept his gaze over the dense crowd, saying,</p><p></p><p>"The Yumeng Demon Tribe is attacking in two directions, one of which is here, and the other is the boundary of the Southern Immortal Realm. They are extremely powerful, and you all must not underestimate them! If we cannot defend this place and the Yumeng Demon Tribe breaks through, then your sects, families, and the billions of lives in the Immortal Realms will be mercilessly annihilated!"</p><p></p><p>"I'm not exaggerating. I believe you can see from the Immortal Emperor's Edicts issued by the major Immortal Realms that our five Immortal Realms have never issued such Edicts simultaneously before."</p><p></p><p>The powerful ones' pupils contracted, and they deeply bowed in silence.</p><p></p><p>"I won't say much more. Prepare yourselves mentally, for what's coming will be a fierce battle, a life-and-death struggle for survival!"</p><p></p><p>Chu Lingian turned back and asked the Old Turtle in a low voice, "Old Turtle, when will the Eternal Immortal Emperor return?"</p><p></p><p>The Old Turtle shook his head, "I don't know the matters concerning the Master."</p><p></p><p>Suddenly, his gaze flashed, looking outside the boundary, and he saw a vast, surging presence approaching.</p><p></p><p>Chu Lingian, Feng Jiu, and the powerful ones also looked with surprise.</p><p></p><p>They saw the figures of the Howling Demon Tigers, the Black Mountain Tree Demons, and the Nine-Winged Feathered Serpents, as well as many yet-to-be-formed black mountain tree demons.</p><p></p><p>"Oh? It's these three tribes," the Old Turtle said with a smile.</p><p></p><p>Chu Lingian and Feng Jiu were also somewhat surprised, but they quickly understood.</p><p></p><p>"Immortal Sovereigns, please open the boundary. The Howling Demon Tigers, Black Mountain Tree Demons, and Nine-Winged Feathered Serpents have come to pay their respects!"</p><p></p><p>Outside the boundary, the Demon Tiger King, the Tree Demon King, and the Feathered Serpent King stood side by side, cupping their hands.</p><p></p><p>Among the Howling Demon Tigers, the Tiger Warrior was also inside, standing beside Sibing Zhu, his peripheral vision sweeping over the terrifying formation, trembling inwardly.</p><p></p><p>Before Chu Lingian and Feng Jiu could say anything, the Old Turtle opened the boundary and smiled at them, "Come in."</p><p></p><p>"Thank you, Senior Turtle."</p><p></p><p>The three kings bowed to the Old Turtle, then led their grand entourage into the Eastern Immortal Realm.</p><p></p><p>The Demon Tiger King, Tree Demon King, and Feathered Serpent King soared up into the sky, appearing before the Old Turtle and the others, slightly bowing and saying,</p><p></p><p>"Senior Turtle, Immortal Emperor Lingian, Immortal Emperor Feng Jiu."</p><p></p><p>Chu Lingian and Feng Jiu glanced at them and nodded slightly without saying anything.</p><p></p><p>It was the Old Turtle who smiled and said, "You're afraid the Yumeng Demon Tribe will attack, and you've come to join us after passing by, right?"</p><p></p><p>The three of them blushed awkwardly, and the Demon Tiger King explained with cupped hands, "Senior Turtle, we do have some selfish motives, but the main reason is that we're here in respect of the Eternal Immortal Emperor, who has previously bestowed us with grace. Now that the Immortal Realm is in peril, we naturally want to repay him."</p><p></p><p>The Demon Tiger King, being the patriarch of the Howling Demon Tigers, spoke quite eloquently, pleasing the Old Turtle, who nodded approvingly and said, "Hehe, you're not bad."</p><p></p><p>Chu Lingian, Feng Jiu, and the powerful ones were slightly surprised, not expecting the Eternal Immortal Emperor to have bestowed grace upon these three demonic tribes.</p><p></p><p>The Howling Demon Tigers, Black Mountain Tree Demons, and Nine-Winged Feathered Serpents also...</p><p></p><p>Here is the full English translation of the Chinese excerpt:</p><p></p><p>They are not simple folk, as these three tribes have essentially ruled over all the races in the outer regions of the five major immortal realms.</p><p></p><p>Among them, the Demon Tiger Emperor, the Demonic Tree Emperor, and the Flying Wyrm Emperor are all at the late Immortal Saint realm in terms of strength, ranking among the top powerhouses in the immortal world.</p><p></p><p>After a moment of silence, the old turtle suddenly noticed the tiger battle below and his eyes widened slightly, before he sneered coldly, "What? Is that the new Sacred Son of your Roaring Demon Tiger Tribe?"</p><p></p><p>The Demon Tiger Emperor was taken aback, and the Demonic Tree Emperor and Flying Wyrm Emperor were also surprised. They couldn't understand how a mere Sacred Son could have caught the attention of an existence like the old turtle.</p><p></p><p>The Demon Tiger Emperor was perplexed. He glanced at Tiger Battle and hesitantly replied, "Senior Turtle's words are correct, he is indeed the new Sacred Son of our Roaring Demon Tiger Tribe..."</p><p></p><p>The old turtle mocked, "I'd like to get to know him. Have him come up here."</p><p></p><p>Huh? Get to know him?</p><p></p><p>The Demon Tiger Emperor was confused, but he didn't dare to be negligent. He looked down atÂè∏ÁßâÁá≠ and said, "Tribal Elder, bring the Sacred Son up here. Senior Turtle wishes to meet him!"</p><p></p><p>Hearing this,Âè∏ÁßâÁá≠'s brow furrowed slightly, but he grabbed the bewildered Tiger Battle and brought him up to where the old turtle and the two Immortal Emperors were.</p><p></p><p>"Quickly pay your respects to Senior Turtle and the two Immortal Emperors!" the Demon Tiger Emperor said sternly to the confused Tiger Battle.</p><p></p><p>"Ah, I pay my respects to Senior Turtle and the two Immortal Emperors!" Tiger Battle snapped out of his daze and hurriedly knelt down, trembling all over, filled with confusion.</p><p></p><p>Âè∏ÁßâÁá≠also bowed with his head lowered.</p><p></p><p>The old turtle looked at them and mockingly asked, "So your name is Tiger Battle, is it?"</p><p></p><p>The Demon Tiger Emperor andÂè∏ÁßâÁá≠ were startled. They hadn't even mentioned the Sacred Son's name yet, how did Senior Turtle know...</p><p></p><p>Even Tiger Battle's pupils contracted, and he trembled as he lowered his head, "Senior Turtle, I am indeed called Tiger Battle..."</p><p></p><p>The old turtle crouched down and looked at him, saying, "After parting ways in the Spiritual Dust Realm, I didn't expect you, little Demon Tiger, to become the Sacred Son of the Roaring Demon Tiger Tribe..."</p><p></p><p>Suddenly hearing about the Spiritual Dust Realm, Tiger Battle could no longer control himself and abruptly looked up at the old turtle, hoarsely asking, "Senior Turtle, just what are you..."</p><p></p><p>The old turtle pretended to reminisce, "It was a dark and windy night back then, if I remember correctly, I was perched on my master's shoulder at the time..."</p><p></p><p>Chu Ling Tian and the others' eyes flickered. Who could the old turtle's master be other than the Eternal Immortal Emperor?</p><p></p><p>The Demon Tiger Emperor, the other two, andÂè∏ÁßâÁá≠also had their pupils dilated. Could it be the Eternal Immortal Emperor?</p><p></p><p>Only Tiger Battle looked at the old turtle with disbelief and horror... This was actually that turtle!</p><p></p><p>That Luo Chang Sheng... could it be... Tiger Battle felt the world spinning, and in the bewildered gazes of everyone, he plummeted from the sky.</p><p></p><p>...</p><p></p><p>In the Southern Immortal Realm, on the Soaring Yang Immortal Continent, in the Bright Sky Domain, powerful auras constantly swept across the sky, each at least at the Great Luo Realm.</p><p></p><p>They were all heading towards the direction of the Sand City.</p><p></p><p>"Ah, it seems that the foreign tribe really is going to attack from our Bright Sky Domain..." </p><p></p><p>Chu Lang sighed with worry as he looked up at the sky.</p><p></p><p>Beside him, Huang Zhong also sighed, "When have we ever seen such commotion in the Immortal Realm? Great Luo Golden Immortals, who were once rare to see, are now appearing in droves as if they cost nothing. It just goes to show how powerful that foreign tribe must be."</p><p></p><p>Chen He quietly said, "I heard that for this great calamity, all the experts above the Great Luo Realm in the Immortal Realm have been mobilized. I imagine Senior Qing Yi is also among that massive army."</p><p></p><p>"Senior Qing Yi must be there, and his position in the Immortal Realm is likely not small either. Judging from the Heavenly Mechanism Pavilion Master's reaction that day, he might even be an Immortal Saint," Chu Lang exclaimed in awe.</p><p></p><p>Huang Zhong smiled reverently, "To think we've actually had the chance to interact with an Immortal Saint-level figure. This life of ours is truly fulfilling."</p>

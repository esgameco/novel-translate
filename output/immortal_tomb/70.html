        <h1>Chapter 70</h1>
        <div class="content">
            <p>Here is the full English translation of the Chinese excerpt:</p><p></p><p>The Tianrun Merchant's Guild, as the largest merchant's guild in the Eastern Domain of the Spiritual Dust Realm, naturally lives up to its grand reputation. üç≠‚ôü‚ûÖÔºôÀ¢ùêá‡∏¢–ñ.ùì¨ùêé‚ìúüíô‡µ†</p><p></p><p>It covers an expansive area, roughly the size of dozens of Moyu Towns, and aside from the luxurious Tianrun Merchant's Guild headquarters built in the very center, all the surrounding buildings also belong to the Tianrun Merchant's Guild.</p><p></p><p>"Sir, this is the Tianrun Merchant's Guild, and this entire area belongs to them," Gu Helin bowed and said with a smile.</p><p></p><p>Lu Changsheng nodded slightly and strode forward with his hands behind his back.</p><p></p><p>"The three of you, please pay the guild membership spirit stones," two guards said with a friendly smile as Lu Changsheng's group approached.</p><p></p><p>Seeing this, Gu Helin casually handed over sixty spirit stones.</p><p></p><p>He had come to the Tianrun Merchant's Guild a few times before, so he knew exactly how much the entrance fee was per person.</p><p></p><p>(Spirit stones: low-grade, mid-grade, high-grade, supreme-grade, rainbow-colored, roughly in a 1:1000 ratio, the last four are used in the immortal realms and the Heavenly Scar.)</p><p></p><p>The guards took the spirit stones, weighed them, and apologetically said, "I'm sorry, but due to the recent ascension of the Elder Patriarch of the Carefree Abode in the Western Domain, the entrance fee has been increased..."</p><p></p><p>Gu Helin was slightly taken aback, inwardly cursing the Tianrun Merchant's Guild for being so good at making money - truly no merchant is without guile.</p><p></p><p>While the invitation was for Nascent Soul and above cultivators to observe, there would undoubtedly be many below Nascent Soul who couldn't resist going to the Western Domain, and they would have to pay the entrance fee again when using the teleportation formation.</p><p></p><p>"Alright, how much has it been increased by?" Gu Helin asked the guard awkwardly, glancing at Lu Changsheng.</p><p></p><p>"Per person..." the guard held up eight fingers.</p><p></p><p>"Eighty?" Gu Helin pursed his lips, then tossed a storage bag to the guard. "There are two hundred low-grade spirit stones in there, which should be enough with what we just paid. You don't need to return the rest."</p><p></p><p>As a Dantian Refiner, he naturally wasn't short on money.</p><p></p><p>The guard happily smiled, "Please, go on in."</p><p></p><p>Gu Helin turned his head and respectfully said, "Sir, let's go in. We've kept you waiting."</p><p></p><p>Lu Changsheng glanced at him and then walked in with his hands behind his back.</p><p></p><p>Gu Helin and the old turtle quickly followed.</p><p></p><p>On the streets and alleys, cultivators bustled about, shoulder to shoulder. Many were setting up stalls by the roadside, sitting cross-legged with their eyes closed, neither hawking nor soliciting business.</p><p></p><p>Aside from the occasional whispered conversations between cultivators, the entire Tianrun Merchant's Guild was surprisingly quiet. The clamor of the mundane world was vastly different from the serenity of the cultivation world.</p><p></p><p>Lu Changsheng walked slowly in the lead, with Gu Helin and the old turtle carefully following behind. However, the beautiful female cultivators they occasionally brushed past did cause the old turtle's mouth to curl up slightly.</p><p></p><p>Gu Helin suddenly remembered something, his eyes lighting up as he hurried forward and respectfully said, "Sir, Helin knows you appreciate fine wine. Coincidentally, there is a renowned vintage here in the Tianrun Merchant's Guild. It's quite famous throughout the Spiritual Dust Cultivation Realm, though it's a bit of a distance from where we are now. Shall I take you there?"</p><p></p><p>Sure enough, Lu Changsheng paused for a moment. His nose twitched as he detected various faint wine aromas in the air, one of which was slightly more distinct - likely the wine Gu Helin had mentioned. It seemed acceptable.</p><p></p><p>"I know where it is," Lu Changsheng said, his eyes flashing, and then the three of them disappeared.</p><p></p><p>As soon as they vanished, the previously quiet street became a bit more lively.</p><p></p><p>"Whoa! Did you all see that? There was a young man and two old men here just now, and they just disappeared in a flash!"</p><p></p><p>"Yeah, teleportation - that's a technique only Transcendental Realm cultivators can use. Could those three have all been Transcendental Realm True Lords? I can't believe I got to see three Transcendental Realm True Lords at the same time in my lifetime. I'm so lucky!"</p><p></p><p>Here is the full English translation of the Chinese excerpt:</p><p></p><p>"I will go die now."</p><p></p><p>"I know you're in a hurry, but don't rush, listen to me. Those three senior predecessors are likely also going to the Western Regions to observe the Ascension Tribulation, it's just... they look quite unfamiliar, and as Transcendent Immortal Lords, they should be like patriarchal figures of the sect, how come we've never heard of them before?"</p><p></p><p>"One of them I do recognize, he looks a lot like the Ancient Immortal from the Azure Cloud Sect..."</p><p></p><p>"Impossible, after all these years, the Ancient Immortal has at most reached the peak of the Golden Core stage, he hasn't even reached the Nascent Soul, let alone Transcendence, so the one just now couldn't have been him."</p><p></p><p>"Mm, definitely not him."</p><p></p><p>"Add one."</p><p></p><p>...</p><p></p><p>Moyu Town.</p><p></p><p>"Clop clop clop..."</p><p></p><p>Three horse-drawn carriages slowly drove out of the town gate, stopping in the distance.</p><p></p><p>The curtain was pulled back, and Chen Dadao poked his head out, his expression dazed as he looked at the place he had stayed for thirteen years.</p><p></p><p>"Town Master..." the old butler was about to speak.</p><p></p><p>But Chen Dadao sighed helplessly, "You, just don't call me Town Master anymore, I'm no longer the Town Master."</p><p></p><p>He had submitted his resignation that day, and just yesterday received the news.</p><p></p><p>Somehow, this trivial matter had reached the ears of the King of the Lishui Kingdom, who immediately agreed and even ordered Chen Dadao to take up a position in the capital immediately.</p><p></p><p>"Master, it may be difficult for you to live comfortably in the capital," the old butler sighed.</p><p></p><p>Compared to the capital, he actually preferred this small town of Moyu, where they used to live so comfortably without any demonic disturbances, without too many worries.</p><p></p><p>In the capital, the center of power, he feared he would have to watch his every step, the slightest misstep could be disastrous.</p><p></p><p>Chen Dadao's brow furrowed slightly as he said, "No, Director Dong and the King of Lishui treated me well before."</p><p></p><p>The old butler shook his head with a smile: "Master, you said 'before', times have changed."</p><p></p><p>Chen Dadao was taken aback, what was the problem with what he said? He was just being realistic...</p><p></p><p>But he didn't immediately refute it, for all these years, the old butler had always been smarter than him, and that was a fact.</p><p></p><p>So he asked, "What do you mean by that?"</p><p></p><p>The old butler took a deep breath and said, "What I'm about to say may not be pleasant, but please don't take it to heart."</p><p></p><p>Chen Dadao raised an eyebrow: "No problem, we've been master and servant for almost a lifetime, I'm just a simple-minded fellow, we can just say it as it is."</p><p></p><p>A warm light flashed in the old butler's eyes as he frankly asked with a smile, "Master, in the past, Director Dong and the King treated you well, but have you honestly asked yourself, was it because they valued you... or because of the Master?"</p><p></p><p>"Uh." Chen Dadao's gaze went blank.</p><p></p><p>He soon lowered his head and sighed dejectedly, "You're right."</p><p></p><p>"Master, you must know that in the political arena, they are all cunning foxes, none of them are simple, they are all self-serving, and even I feel that..."</p><p></p><p>The old butler trailed off.</p><p></p><p>Chen Dadao grew anxious and urged, "Feel what, go on, who do you think you're talking to?"</p><p></p><p>"I even feel that the King of Lishui sending you to the capital might just be because he has some scheme in mind," the old butler's eyes flashed sharply.</p><p></p><p>Chen Dadao stood there dumbfounded, murmuring, "I, Chen Dadao, am alone, what could there be to scheme?"</p><p></p><p>The old butler chuckled, shaking his sleeves, and said solemnly, "The Master stayed in your manor for at least eight years, and now that the Master has left, if I were the King, I would naturally assume the Master left some treasures behind... Master, if you were the King, what would you think?"</p><p></p><p>"I..." </p><p></p><p>Chen Dadao suddenly covered the object in his bosom, lowering his head in silence for a long time.</p>

            <p>Here is the full English translation of the Chinese excerpt:</p><p></p><p>"Old Luo seems a bit off. üêç‚ô†‚ùª‚ûà‚ìàùêáœÖ◊ê.‚ìíÔºØ–ºüçìüë∫"</p><p></p><p>"What's wrong with him?"</p><p></p><p>"It's a bit absurd."</p><p></p><p>"How is it absurd? Are you saying it's absurd that he came to Spring Fragrance Pavilion? Old Luo is the only one in his family, and he doesn't have a warm-hearted wife at home normally, isn't that normal?"</p><p></p><p>"No, I'm not talking about that."</p><p></p><p>"Then what are you talking about?"</p><p></p><p>"What I want to say is, Old Luo is already of such an age, and it's fine if he doesn't have the vigor, but he actually almost made the young lady at Spring Fragrance Pavilion faint... This is a bit too much. And I'm not much younger than Old Luo, so by normal standards, it's impossible for him to have such abilities at this age."</p><p></p><p>"Perhaps Old Luo is exceptionally gifted? I think you're just jealous."</p><p></p><p>"No, I feel like he must have taken some medicine."</p><p></p><p>"Huh, where would he get the medicine from?"</p><p></p><p>"There's only one clinic in Smoke and Rain Town, where else could he get the medicine from?"</p><p></p><p>"Sss! I didn't expect Doctor Lu to have such abilities!"</p><p></p><p>"I have other matters to attend to, I'll take my leave first!"</p><p></p><p>"I have matters to attend to as well, farewell!"</p><p></p><p>"Hey, you all haven't closed your stalls yet, have you?"</p><p></p><p>The people of Spring Fragrance Pavilion discussed the matter back and forth, thoroughly analyzing the whole incident.</p><p></p><p>Luo Gu probably never imagined that the townspeople would be so perceptive, and quickly deduced his embarrassing situation.</p><p></p><p>...</p><p></p><p>Outside Smoke and Rain Town.</p><p></p><p>Two streaks of light flashed across the horizon.</p><p></p><p>Upon reaching the town gate, there was a woman in sect attire and a woman in a snow-white long dress.</p><p></p><p>"Holy Lady, it's been two and a half years since we last came to Smoke and Rain Town. I imagine Xiao Tong has grown quite a bit taller."</p><p></p><p>Xu Jiao respectfully smiled at the woman of exceptional beauty beside her.</p><p></p><p>Su Lianyi gave a slight smile, looking at the dilapidated town gate, her vermilion lips parting, "Yes, Xiao Tong's age is now suitable to embark on the immortal path, so I shall take her back to the Upper Clear Palace."</p><p></p><p>There was a dangerous place, not too far from Smoke and Rain Town.</p><p></p><p>Two and a half years ago, they had passed through Smoke and Rain Town for their sect's cultivation journey, and during their brief rest, they were delighted to discover the Jade Maiden Physique!</p><p></p><p>"Hehe, who would have thought that such a remote little town would produce a Jade Maiden Physique, this constitution seems to be tailor-made for the cultivation methods of our Upper Clear Palace." Xu Jiao showed envy, and seemed to be thinking of something as she asked, "Holy Lady, you haven't told the Sect Master about this, have you? Otherwise, the Sect Master will surely come to personally retrieve Xiao Tong."</p><p></p><p>"No, I want to give the Master a surprise." Su Lianyi smiled slightly, then stepped lightly with lotus-like movements, heading towards the town.</p><p></p><p>Xu Jiao hurriedly followed.</p><p></p><p>However, she was puzzled in her heart. If Xiao Tong was taken back to the Upper Clear Palace, with her Jade Maiden Physique, she might pose a threat to the Holy Lady's position.</p><p></p><p>The Holy Lady is actually so considerate of the sect.</p><p></p><p>Xu Jiao asked herself, if it were her, she might not be able to get over that hurdle in her heart.</p><p></p><p>...</p><p></p><p>Outside the Long Life Clinic.</p><p></p><p>A group of old men looked at each other, their faces full of embarrassment.</p><p></p><p>Well, just now, each of them had said they had matters to attend to and left in different directions, only to unexpectedly meet up again at the Long Life Clinic.</p><p></p><p>However, the most embarrassed one at the moment was a middle-aged man mixed among the group of old men. His face was flushed with redness.</p><p></p><p>It's understandable for the old men to come to the clinic to seek medicine, but for a robust adult like him... he wished he could find a crack in the ground to crawl into.</p><p></p><p>He then gave a sheepish smile: "Gentlemen, I came to see Doctor Lu because my stomach was a bit painful, but since there are so many of you, please go first, I'll come back later."</p><p></p><p>"Go ahead, we understand." The old men nodded solemnly.</p><p></p><p>The middle-aged man couldn't bear their meaningful gazes, shook his head, and quickly ran off.</p><p></p><p>"Ahem, we're all old friends here, we all know what's on each other's minds, so there's no need to be distant. Let's go in together to see Doctor Lu for medicine. Looks like Old Luo is so vigorous, Doctor Lu's medical skills must be truly exceptional."</p><p></p><p>"That's right, that's right, let's all go in. I'm really envious of Old Luo's condition."</p><p></p><p>New 69 Book Bar 99s</p><p></p><p>Here is the full English translation of the Chinese excerpt:</p><p></p><p>After the group of old men revealed their cards, they no longer felt embarrassed. They looked at each other and chuckled, then went in together.</p><p></p><p>A moment later, in the Long Life Medical Clinic.</p><p></p><p>Lu Changsheng was resting in a rocking chair.</p><p></p><p>Xiao Tong was earnestly reading medical books, with countless practice writing papers scattered on the desk.</p><p></p><p>As for Tong Xin, he was meticulously tending to the herb garden in the backyard.</p><p></p><p>In the clinic, the group of old men were just looking at each other, then looking at the desk where Xiao Tong was immersed in reading. Their faces flushed red, unable to speak.</p><p></p><p>They had come in a hurry and forgot that Xiao Tong was now the medicine girl at the Long Life Medical Clinic...</p><p></p><p>With this young girl present, how could they say what they wanted to say.</p><p></p><p>"Gentlemen, which part of your body is not feeling well?" </p><p></p><p>At this time, Lu Changsheng opened his eyes from the rocking chair and smiled at them.</p><p></p><p>Hearing the master's voice suddenly, Xiao Tong's mind also withdrew from the world of the book. She turned her head and saw the group of foolish old men standing there.</p><p></p><p>So she furrowed her brow, stood up happily, and bowed, mouthing the word "Grandpa".</p><p></p><p>Each of them, she knew, had given her help and fed her before.</p><p></p><p>"Ah! Tong'er, sit, sit, sit, continue reading your book. It's us who have disturbed your reading! Old man Zhang is really terrible!"</p><p></p><p>"Ahem, Tong'er, you just continue reading your book. We old fellows just came to see how you're doing at the medical clinic, whether you've been listening to Dr. Lu's advice."</p><p></p><p>"Yes, Tong'er, being the medicine girl at Dr. Lu's clinic is a job that many people can't even get. Do a good job! We old men will take our leave now. Tong'er, if you have time, come over for a meal, we'll make you delicious food."</p><p></p><p>The group of old men spoke awkwardly yet affectionately.</p><p></p><p>After that, they looked at the faintly smiling Lu Changsheng, their old faces flushing red.</p><p></p><p>"Dr. Lu, we just came to see Tong'er, we'll be going now."</p><p></p><p>They then quickly turned around and ran away in a flash in Xiao Tong's bewildered gaze, their aged figures surprisingly agile under the activation of their latent potential.</p><p></p><p>Xiao Tong came to her senses, staring blankly at Lu Changsheng, her gaze carrying a hint of apology.</p><p></p><p>As if saying, "Master, my grandpas have disturbed you."</p><p></p><p>Lu Changsheng waved his hand indifferently, looking at her for a moment, and said, "Do you want to speak?"</p><p></p><p>Xiao Tong was startled, and after a moment, shook her head shyly.</p><p></p><p>Lu Changsheng's eyes flashed, and he understood the young lady's meaning - she was afraid of troubling him. He then smiled and said, "Don't worry, it won't trouble me. And as the medicine girl in my clinic, having a disability is unacceptable. Those patients, if they secretly say that my medical skills are not good, how can I explain that I can't even cure my own clinic's medicine girl? Look at Tong Xin, is he disabled?"</p><p></p><p>Lu Changsheng's expression was calm and unconcerned. He was just saying this for Xiao Tong's sake.</p><p></p><p>Xiao Tong lowered her head for a moment, then wrote on the paper, "Thank you, Master."</p><p></p><p>"No problem," Lu Changsheng said, then pointed at her.</p><p></p><p>Xiao Tong's eyes suddenly widened. She was stunned to see a beam of light burst forth from the tip of the master's finger!</p><p></p><p>The light vanished in an instant.</p><p></p><p>After the shock, Xiao Tong couldn't help but bend down reverently and instinctively say, "Master, you... are an immortal."</p><p></p><p>The young girl's voice, the first time she spoke, was ethereal like the song of a hundred birds.</p><p></p><p>Lu Changsheng smiled and said, "See, you've spoken."</p><p></p><p>Xiao Tong came to her senses, suddenly covering her mouth, her small face full of amazement.</p><p></p><p>Soon, she couldn't help but have tears in her eyes, trembling as she knelt down before Lu Changsheng, choking out, "Thank... Master."</p><p></p><p>At the same time,</p><p></p><p>On the street, Su Lianyi and the other person had not seen Xiao Tong, and they were starting to feel anxious. Could it be that something had happened to the young lady in these two and a half years?</p><p></p><p>They then found a passing woman and asked her.</p><p></p><p>The woman, however, had a slightly wary look in her eyes and did not tell them right away. Instead, she eyed the two women suspiciously. Didn't they know Tong'er in Yuanyu Town?</p><p></p><p>These two women must have some ulterior motives!</p>

        <h1>Chapter 244</h1>
        <div class="content">
            <p>Here is the full English translation of the excerpt from the Chinese novel:</p><p></p><p>Su Lianyi shuddered and looked up at Xiao Tong with difficulty.</p><p></p><p>Lu Changsheng nodded and looked at Tongxin, "Take Xiao Tong to the backyard to tend to the medicinal garden."</p><p></p><p>"Yes."</p><p></p><p>Tongxin quickly responded, giving Xiao Tong a meaningful glance.</p><p></p><p>Xiao Tong silently nodded, bowed to Lu Changsheng, then looked at Su Lianyi briefly before heading towards the herb garden.</p><p></p><p>The moment Tongxin and Xiao Tong's figures disappeared, Lu Changsheng said indifferently, "Kill her."</p><p></p><p>This time, Su Lianyi no longer begged for mercy, her mouth hanging in a demented smile, remaining calm.</p><p></p><p>Yuan Yangchun knew what the senior meant, so he stepped forward and bowed, "Understood."</p><p></p><p>However, he was slightly hesitant, unsure of how the senior wanted Su Lianyi to die - through torture or a quick death.</p><p></p><p>Sensing his uncertainty, Lu Changsheng looked at him and asked, "What do you think?"</p><p></p><p>In an instant, Yuan Yangchun bowed and said, "Yuan Yangchun understands."</p><p></p><p>The next moment, he turned to look at Su Lianyi, a flash of light surging in his palm as he swiftly struck towards her head.</p><p></p><p>"Elder Sect Master, wait!!" </p><p></p><p>Suddenly, the previously silent Yun Mian spoke up in a low shout.</p><p></p><p>Yuan Yangchun's hand paused just three inches from Su Lianyi's head, his hand trembling as he said indifferently, "Sect Master Yun, the senior has given the order, so I can only give you three breaths to say your farewell."</p><p></p><p>Yun Mian quickly turned around and bowed to Lu Changsheng, her voice betraying no emotion, "Senior, Yun Mian dares to request that as the teacher, I be allowed to personally carry out the punishment of my wayward disciple."</p><p></p><p>At this, Su Lianyi's previously calm eyes flickered, and she looked at Yun Mian, her throat dry.</p><p></p><p>"Granted," Lu Changsheng said, looking at her.</p><p></p><p>Yuan Yangchun's gaze flashed briefly before he stepped back.</p><p></p><p>"Thank you, senior." Yun Mian rose, and a slender sword appeared in her hand.</p><p></p><p>She walked up to stand before Su Lianyi.</p><p></p><p>"Teacher..."</p><p></p><p>At this moment, tears began to frantically fall from Su Lianyi's eyes as she breathed heavily. The suppressed anguish in her heart was suffocating her.</p><p></p><p>To have her teacher personally take her life was the greatest punishment for her.</p><p></p><p>Yun Mian looked directly into those crimson eyes and hoarsely said, "Lianyi, how many years have you been the Saint Girl in my Upper Clear Palace?"</p><p></p><p>"Over fifty thousand years."</p><p></p><p>"All these years, I have failed to teach you properly."</p><p></p><p>"Teacher, it is Lianyi's heart that was not right, unable to resist the greed within. It is not your fault..."</p><p></p><p>"The fault is mine."</p><p></p><p>Yun Mian suddenly closed her eyes, and the slender sword swept across.</p><p></p><p>Shing!</p><p></p><p>Su Lianyi's head fell to the ground, her expression frozen in regret and reluctance.</p><p></p><p>Yun Mian struck again, piercing into Su Lianyi's body and shattering the Supreme Elixir within her.</p><p></p><p>With the Supreme Elixir destroyed, Su Lianyi could not die any further.</p><p></p><p>Immediately, without waiting for Yuan Yangchun and the others to react, Yun Mian struck again, severing her own left arm!</p><p></p><p>Her face turned deathly pale as she came before Lu Changsheng, leaning on the sword and kneeling down, her eyes devoid of color as she said dejectedly, "Senior, Yun Mian has failed as a teacher. I hope the senior will be magnanimous and spare me from the Upper Clear Palace."</p><p></p><p>Yuan Yangchun watched the weakened Yun Mian in shock, looking at the severed arm on the ground. He could see that Yun Mian had not simply cut off her arm, but had also severed her cultivation of over ten thousand years!</p><p></p><p>Truly...</p><p></p><p>Lu Changsheng looked at Yun Mian for a moment, then poured a cup of tea and handed it to her.</p><p></p><p>Here is the full English translation of the Chinese excerpt:</p><p></p><p>She laughed and said, "Please have a cup of tea."</p><p></p><p>Yunmei was taken aback, knowing that this matter should be considered over.</p><p></p><p>She immediately sheathed her fine sword, took the teacup, and politely said, "Thank you, senior."</p><p></p><p>Thereafter, she drank the tea in one gulp under the envious and then purple-faced gaze of Yuanyang Qiu.</p><p></p><p>Boom!!</p><p></p><p>Yunmei's situation was just like Yuanyang Qiu's that day, with the violent immortal qi surging in her abdomen, but there were no signs of heavenly tribulation outside.</p><p></p><p>In an instant, her ten-thousand-year cultivation that she had cut off was restored.</p><p></p><p>Her arms also grew out abruptly.</p><p></p><p>The old men were all dumbfounded. They had never seen such a strange scene of long arms before.</p><p></p><p>When Yunmei regained her senses, she also stared blankly at the old men.</p><p></p><p>This cup of tea... was undoubtedly a supreme treasure tea!</p><p></p><p>But these ordinary mortal elders had just drunk it, so why didn't they explode and die?</p><p></p><p>They looked just like they had drunk ordinary mundane tea.</p><p></p><p>Yunmei suppressed the excitement in her heart and bowed, saying, "Thank you, senior."</p><p></p><p>Seeing that Lu Changsheng had not spoken, Yunmei gathered her courage and tremblingly asked, "Senior, can Yunmei take the corpse of the unrighteous disciple back to the palace?"</p><p></p><p>Lu Changsheng glanced at Su Lianyi's corpse. "You can."</p><p></p><p>"Thank you, senior. Yunmei will take her leave first."</p><p></p><p>Yunmei made a salute, stood up, swept her sleeve, and carried Su Lianyi's corpse, disappearing from the medical hall.</p><p></p><p>"Cough, cough, Doctor Lu, we old men will take our leave as well."</p><p></p><p>Seeing this, the old men stood up and laughed awkwardly at Lu Changsheng.</p><p></p><p>Lu Changsheng looked at them meaningfully, and his hand suddenly waved lightly!</p><p></p><p>On the counter, seven sheets of mulberry paper unfolded, the herb cabinet 'clicked' open one after another, and many herbs flew out and fell into the mulberry paper...</p><p></p><p>A moment later, seven packages of herbs flew out and fell into the bewildered old men's arms.</p><p></p><p>"One hundred and forty copper coins."</p><p></p><p>Lu Changsheng tapped the table and smiled.</p><p></p><p>The old men reacted, delighted, and hurriedly took out the copper coins and placed them on the counter.</p><p></p><p>"Doctor Lu, you really understand us..."</p><p></p><p>"Doctor Lu, come to our old men's house when you have time, and we'll make sure you eat and drink well!"</p><p></p><p>"..."</p><p></p><p>The old men hugged the medicine packages as if they were treasures. They were so excited at the thought of being able to regain their vigor like Luo Gu.</p><p></p><p>Lu Changsheng smiled slightly: "The medicine can be boiled twice, but you can only drink it once. If you drink it twice, it will harm your body, do you understand?"</p><p></p><p>"Hehe, we understand, we understand!"</p><p></p><p>"Doctor Lu, then we'll take our leave now. You carry on with your work."</p><p></p><p>The old men didn't seem to have heard it properly and disappeared in a flash. It was clear that they were very impatient.</p><p></p><p>Yuanyang Qiu, who had not yet left, saw how Lu Changsheng was so amiable to the mortals, and he found it somewhat incomprehensible.</p><p></p><p>It seems that in the future, he should be more polite to the mortals in this small town...</p><p></p><p>Yuanyang Qiu's eyes flickered, and suddenly he heard,</p><p></p><p>"Do you have anything else?"</p><p></p><p>"No... no, Doctor Lu, Yangqiu will take his leave."</p><p></p><p>Yuanyang Qiu's body trembled, he made a salute, and quickly left.</p><p></p><p>But in the moment he turned around, his regretful gaze swept over the tea on the table.</p><p></p><p>At the same time, in the herb garden behind the medical hall.</p><p></p><p>Tongxin was trimming the herbs with scissors, and puzzledly asked,</p><p></p><p>"Xiaotong, what's wrong with you? You've been in a daze since you entered the herb garden."</p><p></p><p>Xiaotong's eyes flickered, and she said vaguely, "I... I think I've seen the senior somewhere before."</p><p></p><p>Tongxin: "Huh?"</p>

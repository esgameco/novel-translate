        <h1>Chapter 546</h1>
        <div class="content">
            <p>Here is the full English translation of the Chinese excerpt:</p><p></p><p>Lu Changsheng had already started fishing, one after another.</p><p></p><p>But Zui Qiancheng was still there, frowning and deep in thought.</p><p></p><p>He had been eating the scallion noodles for so many times, but why did they have no taste?</p><p></p><p>Why?</p><p></p><p>Why exactly?</p><p></p><p>"The scallion noodles without any taste, while they can fill the stomach, are not delicious, tasting like wax."</p><p></p><p>Lu Changsheng continued while baiting the hook:</p><p></p><p>"You say I insist on eating the tasteless scallion noodles every day, what am I after? Since I can't taste the flavor, I might as well not eat them and have something else instead."</p><p></p><p>Zui Qiancheng was first perplexed, then his body shook violently, and his expression gradually stiffened.</p><p></p><p>After a long while, Zui Qiancheng sighed bitterly: "Mr. Lu, Qiancheng... also has no other choice. Luo Yi and Mo Ran have already passed away, merged into the Shu Wu Xuan Tian, leaving me as the last Heavenly Earthly Saint. I bear a heavy burden."</p><p></p><p>Lu Changsheng said indifferently: "So you are deluding yourself to find a breakthrough in the mundane world?"</p><p></p><p>Zui Qiancheng nodded silently.</p><p></p><p>"Blinkered, utterly foolish." Lu Changsheng commented.</p><p></p><p>Zui Qiancheng's pupils trembled, wanting to refute but not knowing how.</p><p></p><p>"Your realm and strength have already reached the peak of Shu Wu Xuan Tian, yet you still lose yourself with extreme measures, deluding yourself to seek breakthroughs in the red dust. If I had not awakened you, you would have been forever submerged. As a Heavenly Earthly Saint, is this not foolishness? You might as well say you are responsible, but such behavior is the greatest irresponsibility. You are not even as good as Luo Yi and Mo Ran."</p><p></p><p>"Why don't you tell me, after all this time, have you made any progress at all?"</p><p></p><p>Lu Changsheng looked at the float and said softly.</p><p></p><p>Zui Qiancheng's face changed slightly, hesitating to speak...</p><p></p><p>"Alright, let's talk about the future another time. Just be a honest assistant teacher in my academy, perhaps you will have unexpected gains."</p><p></p><p>Lu Changsheng smiled meaningfully.</p><p></p><p>Zui Qiancheng's eyes flashed, bowing: "Yes."</p><p></p><p>Zui Qiancheng went back to his side, starting to cast the fishing rod. After hesitating for a moment, he turned his head and asked, "Mr. Lu, where do you come from?"</p><p></p><p>Lu Changsheng smiled and said, "The vastness of heaven and earth, the expanse of the Milky Way, wherever I am, that is where I come from."</p><p></p><p>Zui Qiancheng paused, feeling awestruck by Lu Changsheng's realm.</p><p></p><p>"Go ahead and continue running your noodle shop, it won't interfere with anything." Lu Changsheng suddenly said.</p><p></p><p>If because of him, the villagers couldn't eat the noodles from Old Xu's shop, that would be too regretful.</p><p></p><p>"Eh? Mr. Lu, didn't you tell Qiancheng..."</p><p></p><p>Before Zui Qiancheng could finish, Lu Changsheng said meaningfully, "What? You, the renowned Master Zui, find it difficult to create a clone?"</p><p></p><p>"Not difficult." Zui Qiancheng immediately smiled.</p><p></p><p>That's easy then, Mr. Lu still understands him.</p><p></p><p>Of course, it would be better for Lu Changsheng to say this, lest Zui Qiancheng be misunderstood as not being focused and sincere enough.</p><p></p><p>"Hehe." Lu Changsheng chuckled, casually asking, "In the Dao, there are three Heavenly Earthly Saints, then what about the Martial Dao?"</p><p></p><p>Hearing this, Zui Qiancheng replied, "In the Martial Dao, there are three great Martial Emperors - the Shaking Heaven Martial Emperor, the Scarlet Flame Martial Emperor, and the Red Lotus Martial Emperor, and they all still exist in the world."</p><p></p><p>Martial Dao realms: Mortal Martial, Mysterious Martial, Earth Martial, Heaven Martial, Martial Emperor</p><p></p><p>This is also a reason why the Martial Dao is more prosperous than the Dao of the Brush.</p><p></p><p>After all, the three Martial Emperors are all still alive, while the two Heavenly Earthly Saints have passed away.</p><p></p><p>In Zui Qiancheng's eyes, this is actually a good thing...</p><p></p><p>Lu Changsheng nodded without further comment, focusing on his fishing.</p><p></p><p>Zui Qiancheng, seeing that Lu Changsheng did not express any opinion, also tactfully remained silent.</p><p></p><p>...</p><p></p><p>Star Luo Empire, the capital, the North Star Academy.</p><p></p><p>"Principal, the Sect Master of the Dao Yan Sect requests an audience."</p><p></p><p>In the academy, a middle-aged man respectfully said to a white-robed elder sitting in meditation.</p><p></p><p>"Oh? Duan Quan?" </p><p></p><p>Mei Cangwu opened his eyes, a look of puzzlement on his face.</p><p></p><p>"Yes, Principal." The middle-aged man bowed.</p><p></p><p>"Our Dao of the Brush and their Martial Dao have always been..."</p><p></p><p>Here is the full English translation of the Chinese excerpt:</p><p></p><p>"We have not been in contact for a long time. Why has he come to see me? Did Yin Quan tell you what he came for?"</p><p></p><p>Mei Cangwu frowned and asked.</p><p></p><p>"Returning to the Dean, I asked, but Sect Master Yin did not say. However, I observed that his expression was not very good, and he even seemed quite anxious," the middle-aged man replied.</p><p></p><p>Mei Cangwu's eyes flashed slightly as he said, "Have Yin Quan come see me."</p><p></p><p>"Yes."</p><p></p><p>The middle-aged man bowed and withdrew.</p><p></p><p>Soon, the middle-aged man brought the gloomy-faced Yin Quan to the courtyard, and after bowing to Mei Cangwu, he stepped aside.</p><p></p><p>"Dean Mei, it has been a while." Yin Quan clasped his hands.</p><p></p><p>"If there is no important matter, one does not come to the main hall. Moreover, the scholarly and martial paths have never been in harmony. Sect Master Yin, just say what you have to say," Mei Cangwu said indifferently, not even bothering to offer him a seat.</p><p></p><p>Seeing this, Yin Quan's eyes narrowed slightly as he spoke directly, "I have come to seek cooperation with the North Star Academy."</p><p></p><p>Cooperation?</p><p></p><p>Not only was the middle-aged man taken aback, but even Mei Cangwu was momentarily stunned.</p><p></p><p>What cooperation could the North Star Academy have with the Dao Yan Sect?</p><p></p><p>If the Dao Yan Sect wanted to cooperate, shouldn't they go directly to the Tian Wu Sect instead?</p><p></p><p>"My North Star Academy has nothing to cooperate with your Dao Yan Sect. Sect Master Yin, please leave," Mei Cangwu said, not even wanting to ask further about the reason for the cooperation.</p><p></p><p>Yin Quan's voice became solemn as he said, "Dean Mei, don't have this attitude. To be frank, in this Star Luo Empire, apart from the Tian Wu Sect frequently oppressing your North Star Academy, we other sects have not really offended the North Star Academy, have we?"</p><p></p><p>Mei Cangwu replied indifferently, "It's true that you haven't really offended us, but you are all martial sects, and that's enough."</p><p></p><p>Yin Quan's gaze lowered as he waved his sleeve and said, "Dean Mei, the Sect Master is not here to talk nonsense. I have come with sincerity to seek cooperation, and the cooperation is to eliminate... the Tian Wu Sect!"</p><p></p><p>!!</p><p></p><p>As soon as the words left his mouth, Mei Cangwu and the middle-aged man's pupils shrank, staring at Yin Quan in disbelief!</p><p></p><p>Had they heard wrong?</p><p></p><p>Eliminate the Tian Wu Sect?</p><p></p><p>What was going on here? Were they in internal conflict?</p><p></p><p>After a moment, Mei Cangwu took a deep breath and did not rashly believe it, but said with a hint of meaning, "Sect Master Yin, what do you mean by this? This old man does not understand."</p><p></p><p>Yin Quan knew that Mei Cangwu would not easily believe it, as this matter involved huge implications. So he quickly recounted the events that had occurred in Auspicious Town.</p><p></p><p>"Dean Mei, the matter is as such. The Tian Wu Sect has connected with various martial sects to kill our Dao Yan Sect's five Elders, and even the Grand Elder who went to investigate nearly lost his life! This grievance, I, the Sect Master, cannot tolerate! I must make the Tian Wu Sect pay the price!"</p><p></p><p>Yin Quan said angrily.</p><p></p><p>To make him leave the Star Luo Empire? That was impossible!</p><p></p><p>Cough, well, it's not that it's impossible, but if Mei Cangwu didn't agree to cooperate today, he would immediately return to the sect to prepare and leave the Star Luo Empire.</p><p></p><p>As the saying goes, "As long as the green hills remain, there will be no shortage of firewood to burn."</p><p></p><p>At worst, he would just come back and kill them!</p><p></p><p>As for people dying and falling to the ground, that kind of thing, Yin Quan would only do it if he was confident, such as if the North Star Academy agreed to cooperate!</p><p></p><p>In this regard, Yin Quan was actually quite confident.</p><p></p><p>These years, the North Star Academy hasn't been doing too well either, and he believed that Mei Cangwu had some pent-up resentment in his heart!</p><p></p><p>At this moment, Mei Cangwu fell into contemplation, and his expression clearly showed that he was somewhat moved.</p><p></p><p>If Yin Quan added some more fuel to the fire at this point...</p><p></p><p>"Dean Mei, let's be straightforward. After we eliminate the Tian Wu Sect, the resources will be six for me and four for you!"</p><p></p><p>Sure enough, Yin Quan immediately said in a deep voice.</p><p></p><p>However, Mei Cangwu was also an old fox. Hearing the six-four division, his brow couldn't help but twitch, but he still managed to keep his composure!</p><p></p><p>"Damn it, seven for me and three for you!" Yin Quan slapped the table and shouted.</p><p></p><p>Mei Cangwu finally let out a light sigh and stood up, smiling as he invited, "Sect Master Yin, please have a seat and have a cup of tea."</p>

        <h1>Chapter 14</h1>
        <div class="content">
            <p>Here is the full English translation of the Chinese novel excerpt:</p><p></p><p>Five days later.</p><p></p><p>Under the urgency of Tongxin and the others, they finally returned to the Qingyun Sect.</p><p></p><p>"Senior Brother Tong."</p><p></p><p>At the gate of the Qingyun Sect, two disciple guards hurriedly paid their respects.</p><p></p><p>Tongxin nodded on the flying carpet, then looked at the ten outer sect disciples on the ground with an embarrassed expression and said lightly, "Fellow junior brothers and sisters, you don't need to think too much about it, just go back and cultivate well."</p><p></p><p>After saying that, he was about to ride the flying carpet and fly towards the mountain peak where the Ancient Crane Forest was located.</p><p></p><p>"Senior Brother Tong!!"</p><p></p><p>Suddenly, the outer sect disciples called out to Tongxin.</p><p></p><p>Tongxin was slightly taken aback, and turned his head with a puzzled look at them.</p><p></p><p>The two guard disciples were also somewhat puzzled.</p><p></p><p>The ten outer sect disciples respectfully bowed down and sincerely said, "Senior Brother Tong, we are just humble outer sect disciples, while you are the esteemed inner sect disciple. Yet you... We are grateful for Senior Brother Tong's lifesaving grace."</p><p></p><p>They understood in their hearts that on that day, Tongxin did not abandon them, and used such precious means to save them!!</p><p></p><p>From that day on, Tongxin often seemed dazed and lost.</p><p></p><p>On the flying carpet, Tongxin paused for a moment, and his heart suddenly calmed down. He smiled and said, "As long as life remains, anything is possible. Fellow junior brothers and sisters, work hard in your cultivation."</p><p></p><p>"We will certainly make a hundred times the effort! We will not let Senior Brother Tong down!" </p><p></p><p>The group of disciples clasped their fists and exclaimed.</p><p></p><p>Tongxin nodded approvingly, without saying anything more, and guided the flying carpet towards the mountain peak.</p><p></p><p>...</p><p></p><p>On a majestic mountain peak of the Qingyun Sect.</p><p></p><p>"Master, your disciple seeks an audience!"</p><p></p><p>Outside the cave dwelling, Tongxin knelt on the ground and respectfully called out.</p><p></p><p>Rumble...</p><p></p><p>The cave dwelling opened, and Ancient Crane Forest walked out, stroking his beard and smiling satisfactorily, "Tongxin, you completed the demon-subduing task quite quickly, showing that you have not been indulging in play, not bad."</p><p></p><p>"Master..."</p><p></p><p>Suddenly, Tongxin called out in a low voice.</p><p></p><p>Hmm? Ancient Crane Forest's hand movement paused, and he looked at Tongxin with some puzzlement.</p><p></p><p>"Master, the talisman treasure that you bestowed upon your disciple... the one left by the Patriarch... I have used it up." Tongxin said tremblingly.</p><p></p><p>Ancient Crane Forest suddenly yanked out a tuft of white beard!</p><p></p><p>He did not rush to scold, but narrowed his eyes and looked towards the direction of the Secular Water Emperor Realm, asking in a deep voice, "What happened?"</p><p></p><p>Tongxin straightened up, organized his words, and began to report to Ancient Crane Forest about the events that occurred in the Water Emperor Realm.</p><p></p><p>The more Ancient Crane Forest listened, the more his brows furrowed!</p><p></p><p>In just one city, there actually appeared three black-tongued demons!</p><p></p><p>According to Tongxin's implication, the demonic disturbance was not limited to just that Jia Yuan City...</p><p></p><p>Ancient Crane Forest's old eyes flashed with sharp light. In the past, when demons and monsters appeared in the secular world, they were usually just some small demons on par with the Refinement Qi realm. But this time, why was it like this?</p><p></p><p>Have the demon and monster realms forgotten the covenant with the Immortal Cultivation Realm?</p><p></p><p>Ancient Crane Forest pondered for a moment and said, "Tongxin, you will follow your master to the secular world!"</p><p></p><p>"Ah?" Tongxin suddenly looked up, unable to believe it. "Master, are you going to take action personally??"</p><p></p><p>Some second-tier demonic beasts, it's not necessary for the Master to go, right? Let some weaker elders take their disciples instead.</p><p></p><p>Ancient Crane Forest naturally knew what Tongxin was thinking in his head, so he said helplessly, "Tongxin, you should understand your master. If it weren't for the Sect Master and the others not having returned yet, do you think your master would want to go?"</p><p></p><p>The Sect Master and the others haven't returned yet? Tongxin nodded in astonishment.</p><p></p><p>"There's no time to waste, let's go! Otherwise, the people of the Water Emperor Realm may suffer heavy casualties!"</p><p></p><p>Ancient Crane Forest pulled Tongxin up and disappeared into the sky like a beam of light!</p><p></p><p>Here is the full English translation of the Chinese excerpt:</p><p></p><p>This scene was witnessed by many disciples of the Qingyun Sect!</p><p></p><p>"That's Xianhe Peak! Where is Elder Gu going?"</p><p></p><p>"I reckon he's going to the mortal world. Just now, the outer disciples were all abuzz, saying that two-level demonic beasts have appeared in the mortal world, and there are quite a few of them."</p><p></p><p>"Two-level demonic beasts on par with Foundation Establishment cultivators?! Heavens! How could such powerful demonic beasts appear in the mortal world!"</p><p></p><p>"But surely Elder Gu, with his lofty reputation, doesn't need to go himself?"</p><p></p><p>"Are you an idiot? Apart from the Mountain Guardian Elder, are there any other Elders left in the sect?"</p><p></p><p>"......"</p><p></p><p>.........</p><p></p><p>.........</p><p></p><p>The Demon Realm.</p><p></p><p>Before them was a dark, gloomy world, with withered vines and ancient trees stretching for miles, upon which countless crows flapped their wings, their eerie "caws" echoing through the air.</p><p></p><p>Atop the steep cliffs stood five figures.</p><p></p><p>Beneath the cliffs, a vast, billowing black mist rolled, so strange and unsettling that it would make any cultivator's soul tremble, for this black mist was the manifestation of demonic beasts!</p><p></p><p>One could foresee that if one were to be enveloped by it, they would be torn apart and devoured in an instant!</p><p></p><p>"Where is the Demon Clan Leader of the Black Tongue Tribe?"</p><p></p><p>The leading figure on the cliff spoke in a faint tone.</p><p></p><p>The black mist below stirred, and soon a wisp of black mist materialized into an ugly-faced demon with a long tongue, who respectfully bowed and said, "Demon King, your humble servant is here."</p><p></p><p>"I previously instructed your tribe on a matter. How is the progress?"</p><p></p><p>The dark figure on the cliff asked indifferently.</p><p></p><p>The Demon Clan Leader of the Black Tongue Tribe trembled and reported, "Demon King, a while ago, I sent some of my tribe's members to the Eastern Domain of the Lingchen Immortal Cultivation World, the Empire of Lishui, and six of them have died... This matter may eventually alert the Lingchen Immortal Cultivation World."</p><p></p><p>"Let it alert them, for a great battle is inevitable sooner or later," the dark figure said indifferently, then continued, "This time, I want to tell you to accelerate the progress. Your Black Tongue Tribe members must not be too playful. This matter is of great importance. If necessary, you should go there yourself!"</p><p></p><p>"I understand!" The Demon Clan Leader of the Black Tongue Tribe quickly acknowledged.</p><p></p><p>"Then go and take care of it." The dark figure waved his hand, dismissing the Demon Clan Leader, then swept his gaze across the many high-ranking demonic beasts and said, "You all from the various tribes should also prepare yourselves. War can come at any time, and in the future, there will surely be a battle between the Demon Realm and the Lingchen Immortal Cultivation World! Everything will depend on the will of the Demon Sovereign and the Demon King."</p><p></p><p>"Yes!!!"</p><p></p><p>A fierce roar came from the billowing black mist.</p><p></p><p>Seeing their high morale, the dark figure was satisfied and said, "You may all withdraw."</p><p></p><p>Whoosh, whoosh, whoosh~</p><p></p><p>The black mist surged and dispersed in all directions, leaving the area empty in moments.</p><p></p><p>"Shen Yan, why has the Demon Sovereign suddenly wanted to make a move against the Lingchen Immortal Cultivation World?"</p><p></p><p>On the cliff, a burly man with bulging muscles turned to the leading dark figure and asked in a deep voice.</p><p></p><p>Hearing this, the other three figures also looked at the leading Shen Yan with puzzlement.</p><p></p><p>As everyone knows, among the five great Demon Kings, the mightiest Shen Yan has the closest relationship with the Demon Sovereign.</p><p></p><p>Shen Yan turned around, revealing a youthful and strikingly handsome appearance, but his skin was unnaturally pale, like that of a dead person, and his eyes were as black as the abyss.</p><p></p><p>Zhao Shen Yan swept his gaze across the four Demon Kings and smiled faintly, "The Demon Sovereign's cultivation has already reached a bottleneck..."</p><p></p><p>The four Demon Kings' pupils shrank, for this piece of information was too significant!</p><p></p><p>Combining it with the Black Tongue Tribe's expedition to the mortal Empire in the Lingchen Immortal Cultivation World, it seems to be near a certain legendary place...</p><p></p><p>Seeing the expressions of the four Demon Kings, Zhao Shen Yan smiled deeply, "Correct, the purpose of this alliance between the Demon Realm and the Demon Beasts is something you have already guessed. I won't elaborate further, hehe."</p>

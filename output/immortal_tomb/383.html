        <h1>Chapter 383</h1>
        <div class="content">
            <p>Here is the full English translation of the Chinese excerpt:</p><p></p><p>"Aren't you the one looking for me?" </p><p></p><p>Shen Luo heard the man in blue robes ask repeatedly, and his heart was terrified, burying his head even lower, his body trembling even more!</p><p></p><p>He was truly afraid.</p><p></p><p>"M-Milord, please spare our lives, our deity..." Shen Wei had just mustered the courage to speak up,</p><p></p><p>when Lu Changsheng suddenly glared at him: "Did I tell you to speak?"</p><p></p><p>Boom!!</p><p></p><p>With that one glare, Shen Wei instantly exploded into a mist of blood!!</p><p></p><p>Seeing this, everyone dared not make a sound, shivering like cicadas in the cold.</p><p></p><p>The Third High Priest of the Heavenly God Tribe, ranked 36th in individual combat strength, had just died like that...</p><p></p><p>Everything was so terrifying and even eerie, if not for the horrifying scene they had just witnessed, they would have been utterly shocked.</p><p></p><p>The man in blue robes was undoubtedly the God of Death, as if he could easily reap the lives of anyone he wished.</p><p></p><p>"Haha...haha...haha...!"</p><p></p><p>Shen Luo suddenly started heaving, his breathing erratic, as he knocked his head against the blood-soaked ground, completely disheveled.</p><p></p><p>Shen Luo wanted to plead for mercy, but he dared not, he was afraid, afraid of being blown up in the same bizarre way as Uncle Wei.</p><p></p><p>Now he could only humble himself, hoping to live to see another day.</p><p></p><p>He just couldn't believe that even the ten peak great clan leaders combined could not defeat this man in blue!</p><p></p><p>Lu Changsheng spoke softly, "The Dragon Clan, the Devouring Beast Clan, leave. As for these..."</p><p></p><p>He then swept his gaze over Shen Luo, Feng Jun, Bai Qianmo and the other peak great clan heirs and heiresses, continuing, "Detain them for now."</p><p></p><p>Hearing this, Shen Luo and the others were overjoyed in their hearts, but dared not show it on their faces!</p><p></p><p>As for Bi Qiong and Ao Xing, they paused for a moment, then quickly got up, respectfully bowing to Lu Changsheng before leaving without looking back!</p><p></p><p>Hearing Lu Changsheng's order, the five human race leaders did not dare to be negligent, quickly coming over and first humbly bowing to Lu Changsheng, then preparing to bind Shen Luo and the others.</p><p></p><p>As for Lu Changsheng not killing Shen Luo and the others, Jian Wuhui and the others also let out a slight sigh of relief.</p><p></p><p>If these people were killed, the pressure from the ten peak great clan leaders would be unimaginable.</p><p></p><p>With Lu Changsheng present, Shen Luo and the others naturally did not dare to resist, and were obediently bound by Jian Wuhui and the others.</p><p></p><p>At this time, Lu Changsheng looked at the bound Shen Luo and the others and smiled:</p><p></p><p>"Do you think I have reservations and dare not kill you?"</p><p></p><p>Shen Luo and the others kept their heads down, not daring to look directly at Lu Changsheng, nor daring to respond.</p><p></p><p>In their eyes, how could the man in blue possibly not dare to kill them...</p><p></p><p>After all, so many tribes had been killed, even the Third High Priest of the Heavenly God Tribe had been killed......</p><p></p><p>Of course, the man in blue may also have reservations, this is true!</p><p></p><p>Because the top ten peak great clan leaders, if they unite, would be terrifyingly powerful!!</p><p></p><p>The man in blue, no matter how strong he is, may not necessarily be their match!</p><p></p><p>Moreover, he still has the human race behind him, so having reservations is very normal.</p><p></p><p>But Lu Changsheng's next words made everyone tremble:</p><p></p><p>"As I said before, those who don't retreat will die, did you think I was just talking? Rest assured, when your elders arrive..."</p><p></p><p>"I will kill them in front of their eyes."</p><p></p><p>Shen Luo and the others suddenly looked up, looking at Lu Changsheng in disbelief, then quickly lowered their heads again.</p><p></p><p>Lu Changsheng suddenly looked towards the distant figures, those were the tiny tribes ranked extremely low, like the Fly Tribe.</p><p></p><p>This gaze of Lu Changsheng terrified these tribes, not knowing what to do.</p><p></p><p>"Where is the Liuli Heart?"</p><p></p><p>Lu Changsheng asked sideways.</p><p></p><p>Jian Wuhui hesitated, then replied, "It's here, it's here."</p><p></p><p>Here is the full English translation of the excerpt from the Chinese novel:</p><p></p><p>About to summon out one thousand six hundred and sixty-six dazzlingly beautiful glass hearts, they floated in the air.</p><p></p><p>"You don't need that many."</p><p></p><p>Lu Changsheng gently shook his head, and then with a flick of his sleeve, around a thousand glass hearts flew out in front of the stunned onlookers.</p><p></p><p>They quickly flew in front of the small clans, hovering.</p><p></p><p>Seeing this, the Fly Clan Chief and the others were dumbfounded and at a loss.</p><p></p><p>When had they ever seen so many glass hearts... they were so dazzling.</p><p></p><p>The next moment, they heard the man in blue robes say from afar, "Quickly leave, and as for these thousand glass hearts, distribute them among yourselves."</p><p></p><p>The Fly Clan Chief and the other clan chiefs were stunned for a moment, then their hearts started racing and their eyes reddened.</p><p></p><p>Were these for them?</p><p></p><p>So many...</p><p></p><p>Glass hearts were priceless treasures for their small clans, and it was difficult to obtain even one in the past, and the so-called Seven-Colored Glass Pagoda was mostly just a formality.</p><p></p><p>But now, a full thousand were laid out before them.</p><p></p><p>What generosity!</p><p></p><p>They couldn't help but wonder, if the top ten peak clans had the strength to collect all the glass hearts, would they distribute some to them... let alone a thousand.</p><p></p><p>The Fly Clan Chief and the others hurriedly paid their respects, shouting from afar:</p><p></p><p>"We, thank the great lord!!!"</p><p></p><p>As if seeing the man in blue robes nod slightly, the many small clans remembered his earlier words to leave quickly, and dared not linger any longer. Taking one last look at the terrifying mountain of corpses and sea of blood, they swiftly departed.</p><p></p><p>The heavens and earth finally fell silent at this moment.</p><p></p><p>Jian Wuhui hesitated for a moment, then asked: "Great lord, how shall we deal with them?"</p><p></p><p>"Hang them on the city walls of your Tian City," Lu Changsheng instructed, then disappeared in a flash.</p><p></p><p>"Phew--"</p><p></p><p>As soon as Lu Changsheng left, sighs and gasps of relief could be heard all around.</p><p></p><p>The cultivators of the Human Clan all collapsed to the ground, looking at the mountain of corpses and sea of blood with difficulty.</p><p></p><p>Although they had done nothing, the psychological pressure they had endured was immense.</p><p></p><p>The Human Clan cultivators all deeply remembered that face, and in the future, if they encountered him, they must pay respects and kowtow immediately!</p><p></p><p>After their emotions had calmed down a bit, they became excited and exhilarated again. With a peak expert like the great lord, the Human Clan had truly risen!</p><p></p><p>They couldn't help but look at the number one on the Individual Combat Strength Ranking, the Heavenly God Clan's Shen E.</p><p></p><p>The Heavenly God Clan's Heavenly God Master.</p><p></p><p>Probably even he wasn't as strong as the great lord.</p><p></p><p>It's just that if the peak clan chiefs in the top ten of the Individual Combat Strength Ranking were to unite, could the great lord still withstand them?</p><p></p><p>Inevitably, the crowd became somewhat worried again.</p><p></p><p>Regardless, the immense strength of the top ten on the Individual Combat Strength Ranking was deeply rooted in the hearts of everyone on the Divine-Demon Battlefield.</p><p></p><p>Thinking of this, the crowd looked at the bound Shen Luo and the others with a worried gaze, feeling that an even greater calamity awaited the Human Clan.</p><p></p><p>If the Human Clan could persist through the joint attack of the top ten peak clans, perhaps that would be the true rise.</p><p></p><p>"All of you, retreat back to the Human Clan's territory!"</p><p></p><p>At this time, Jian Wuhui shouted.</p><p></p><p>"Yes!"</p><p></p><p>The cultivators hurriedly turned around and headed back towards the Human Clan's territory.</p><p></p><p>"Wait!"</p><p></p><p>Suddenly, Jian Wuhui stopped the Human Clan cultivators and sternly ordered, "If anyone encounters that great lord, you must pay respects and kowtow immediately, do not be negligent!"</p>

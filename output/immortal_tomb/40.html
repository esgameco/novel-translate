        <div class="content">
            <p>Here is my translation of the Chinese excerpt:</p><p></p><p>The sky was snowing. üêùüë§‚ùª‚ùæ≈û–Ωùìäœá.ÂåöœÉùìÇüéâüêü</p><p></p><p>It was still the same little tavern.</p><p></p><p>Lu Changsheng walked in slowly, but he was greeted by an unfamiliar waiter.</p><p></p><p>"Oh, sir, please come this way~"</p><p></p><p>Lu Changsheng went to his usual seat and asked with a smile, "It's been a while since I've been here, have the waiters all changed?"</p><p></p><p>The waiter was taken aback, not understanding, but seeing the young man's refined bearing and knowing he was a customer, he could only awkwardly go along with it.</p><p></p><p>"I'll have a pot of peach blossom wine." Lu Changsheng said, then turned to look out the window.</p><p></p><p>The waiter gave a wry smile, looking troubled. "Sir, the peach blossom wine sold out in the autumn, so..."</p><p></p><p>Just then, a young manager came in from the back.</p><p></p><p>He habitually glanced at the window seat, then froze, a look of delight quickly spreading across his face as he hurried over and bowed to Lu Changsheng. "Sir, it's been a while since you've come to the tavern."</p><p></p><p>The waiter was bewildered seeing the manager's reaction.</p><p></p><p>Lu Changsheng looked at the young manager and remarked, "It's been some time, and you've become the manager now."</p><p></p><p>This young manager was the former waiter, Zhang Cheng.</p><p></p><p>Zhang Cheng was silent for a moment, then forced a smile. "Sir, you don't know, the previous manager has passed away..."</p><p></p><p>Lu Changsheng remained silent, listening attentively.</p><p></p><p>"The manager was already quite old, 79 years old. About two months ago, at the start of winter, he caught a cold and passed away the next night. He had never married or had children, and had no family. Before he died, he entrusted the tavern to me to manage. He was quite strict with me, but when I had nowhere else to go, he took me in, and I've been here for nearly ten years..." Zhang Cheng's voice grew choked with emotion towards the end.</p><p></p><p>Lu Changsheng's expression remained unchanged. He had seen many partings and deaths.</p><p></p><p>He spoke softly, "My condolences."</p><p></p><p>Zhang Cheng wiped his eyes and smiled. "Sir, were you wanting the peach blossom wine? I've already prepared some, it was the manager's own vintage from the wine cellar. Please wait a moment."</p><p></p><p>Lu Changsheng stopped him, "No need, I'll have it next spring when it opens."</p><p></p><p>Zhang Cheng paused, then a warm feeling spread through him. "Alright..."</p><p></p><p>...</p><p></p><p>In the Demon Realm.</p><p></p><p>"That Lie Tengse has some brains, to have seen through my attempt to provoke him," Zhao Shenyuan sneered.</p><p></p><p>Chu Qingcang laughed awkwardly. "Shenyuan, what are we going to do? It's been five years since the last time, and we still haven't heard anything from the Demon Lord."</p><p></p><p>At this, Zhao Shenyuan grew pensive, narrowing his eyes. "I don't know, but I feel like the Demon Lord has been troubled by something lately..."</p><p></p><p>Troubled? Chu Qingcang scratched his head, perplexed. The supreme ruler of the Demon Realm, troubled?</p><p></p><p>"Haha, Zhao Shenyuan, come out!" </p><p></p><p>Just then, a wild laughter rang out from outside the palace.</p><p></p><p>"Lie Tengse?" Zhao Shenyuan's eyes narrowed. "Let's go see."</p><p></p><p>Soon, Zhao Shenyuan and Chu Qingcang appeared outside the palace.</p><p></p><p>Zhao Shenyuan swept his gaze over the five Demon Kings, then focused on the young man in the lead, smiling. "I wondered who was barking like a dog, turns out it's the Demon King Lie Tengse. What brings you to our Demon Realm this time, Lie Tengse?"</p><p></p><p>"You!" Lie Tengse's eyes narrowed, but his expression quickly smoothed into a mocking smile. "Zhao Shenyuan, don't you have something you want to say?"</p><p></p><p>Here is the full English translation of the Chinese excerpt:</p><p></p><p>"What is there for this king to say? It's just that this trip to the Demon Realm has truly opened my eyes. A small matter of being away from the water, yet it took five years to subdue them - how interesting," Zhao Shenyuan mocked.</p><p></p><p>"Hehe, don't just blurt things out. Do you, Zhao Shenyuan, really think this king is an idiot? Last time was nothing more than trying to provoke us," Lie Teng Snake sneered.</p><p></p><p>"Provoke you? Demon King Teng Snake, are you overthinking things? This king merely sent out demonic beasts twice, yet was unable to subdue the Lishui, feeling a bit dejected, so I just wanted to see the tricks of your Demon Realm, but alas, I was disappointed."</p><p></p><p>Zhao Shenyuan continued, "But no matter, this king will take action."</p><p></p><p>If he hadn't sensed something off about Lishui, and his own Abyss Magic Spear was still intact, he would have already gone over and killed them.</p><p></p><p>It's really too embarrassing for the mighty Demon King to take action before the great battle even begins!</p><p></p><p>Lie Teng Snake's expression changed slightly as he shouted, "You're talking nonsense! You were trying to provoke this king back then!"</p><p></p><p>"Think whatever you want. Qing Cheng, let's go, we'll discuss the next step. As for them, well, they're not worth relying on."</p><p></p><p>Zhao Shenyuan waved his hand at Chu Qingcheng and walked into the palace.</p><p></p><p>"Zhao Shenyuan!! Just you wait! In less than five days, this king will subdue Lishui, and let you know that the demonic beasts of our Demon Realm are far superior to the demonic creatures of your Demon Realm!"</p><p></p><p>Lie Teng Snake growled, truly displeased by Zhao Shenyuan's indifferent attitude.</p><p></p><p>He had originally wanted to mock and taunt, but who knew the other party would be so unconcerned.</p><p></p><p>"Hmph, forget it, let our Demon Realm take care of it."</p><p></p><p>Zhao Shenyuan no longer paid attention to Lie Teng Snake and strolled into the palace with Chu Qingcheng.</p><p></p><p>"Hmph! This king said the Demon Realm will handle it, so the Demon Realm will handle it! Your Demon Realm better not interfere this time! Let's go!"</p><p></p><p>Lie Teng Snake waved his hand and left with the five other gloomy-faced Demon Kings.</p><p></p><p>Meanwhile, in the palace.</p><p></p><p>Zhao Shenyuan sneered disdainfully, "Haha, Qingcheng, did you see that? Stupid pigs will always be stupid pigs. What use is being occasionally clever? They can't even withstand a little provocation."</p><p></p><p>Seeing Zhao Shenyuan's smug expression, Chu Qingcheng somehow couldn't bring himself to laugh.</p><p></p><p>He felt like he had been indirectly mocked as well.</p><p></p><p>.........</p><p></p><p>Two days later.</p><p></p><p>Qingyun Sect.</p><p></p><p>A transmission suddenly sounded in the Gu He Lin Dwelling,</p><p></p><p>"Elder Gu, the Lishui Empire has suddenly spawned many demonic beasts! We don't have enough manpower and can't handle it at all... Chen Shidi, look over there!!"</p><p></p><p>The transmission talisman burned out.</p><p></p><p>Elder Gu Helin's gaze turned grave as he rushed out of the dwelling.</p><p></p><p>After five years, it has begun again.</p><p></p><p>Previously it was the demonic creatures of the Demon Realm, and now it's the demonic beasts... </p><p></p><p>Could it be that the Demon Realm is also involved?!</p><p></p><p>The situation seems to have become quite serious.</p><p></p><p>Lishui Empire.</p><p></p><p>The eastern, southern, western, and northern regions all erupted in demonic beast chaos at the same time!</p><p></p><p>This time, the demonic beasts did not sneak around and attack by surprise like the previous demonic creatures.</p><p></p><p>Instead, they openly and in large groups assaulted the city gates, intent on breaking down the city walls!</p><p></p><p>This caused the city lords to turn deathly pale, their hearts filled with grief and sorrow. Heavens, why do these demonic creatures always target them when they are away from the water?</p><p></p><p>If these demonic beasts manage to break through, the consequences would be unimaginable, the casualties far exceeding those from five years ago!</p><p></p><p>In the remote Moyu Town on the eastern edge of the empire,</p><p></p><p>there are currently over ten demonic beasts gathered outside the town, their bloodthirsty roars shaking the heavens as their crimson eyes stare fixatedly at Moyu Town.</p>

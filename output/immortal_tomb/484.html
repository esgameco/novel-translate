        <h1>Chapter 484</h1>
        <div class="content">
            <p>Here is the full English translation of the Chinese excerpt:</p><p></p><p>"Ah, it seems there's a group of people who have just landed on the island and want to enter the city. Brothers, shall we go ask them?"</p><p></p><p>The members of the Three Tigers Gang were heading towards the port when one of them suddenly noticed the figures in the distance.</p><p></p><p>The members of the Three Tigers Gang exchanged glances and then rushed over.</p><p></p><p>"Hold on, we are the Three Tigers Gang of Eternal Night Island. There's something we'd like to ask you all!"</p><p></p><p>As luck would have it, the group the Three Tigers Gang encountered was none other than Lü Changsheng and the others.</p><p></p><p>The captain and the monks looked at each other, but as soon as the members of the Three Tigers Gang approached, their expressions changed abruptly!</p><p></p><p>For the robes worn by these monks were exactly the same as those worn by the group that had previously tried to plunder the Sea Transport No. 3!</p><p></p><p>Hearing them mention the "Three Tigers Gang", the captain couldn't help but think it was a rather crude name.</p><p></p><p>The captain quickly glared at the monks, signaling them not to say anything, and then looked to Lü Changsheng for guidance.</p><p></p><p>Lü Changsheng closed his eyes and said indifferently, "It has nothing to do with me. You decide."</p><p></p><p>"Yes, milord," the captain replied, understanding Lü Changsheng's meaning and not daring to ask further. He then turned to examine the members of the Three Tigers Gang who had approached them, and with a smile, he said:</p><p></p><p>"Haha, so you gentlemen have stopped us. What can we do for you?"</p><p></p><p>The members of the Three Tigers Gang, however, had a slight change in expression, for they had also noticed the attire of the captain and a few of the crew members.</p><p></p><p>The Sea Transport Guild?!</p><p></p><p>The members of the Three Tigers Gang exchanged glances, and their fierce expressions quickly disappeared.</p><p></p><p>The leader of the group smiled and said, "Ah, so you are friends from the Sea Transport Guild. We didn't mean any harm. We just happened to stop you to ask if you've seen our leader, the Grand Elder of the Three Tigers Hall, during your time on the island?"</p><p></p><p>The Grand Elder of the Three Tigers Hall?</p><p></p><p>The captain and the monks furrowed their brows, simultaneously recalling the middle-aged man who had been their leader.</p><p></p><p>That must be the one they call the Grand Elder...</p><p></p><p>"Haha, Three Tigers Gang brothers, we've only just arrived on Eternal Night Island and haven't encountered anyone else besides you," the captain said with a smile.</p><p></p><p>In truth, the captain wanted to kill these members of the Three Tigers Gang on the spot, but they were not too far from Eternal Night City, and any unexpected incidents would be troublesome.</p><p></p><p>Moreover, the captain and a few crew members alone would not be able to handle these members of the Three Tigers Gang.</p><p></p><p>As for the other monks, they were not part of the Sea Transport Guild, and the captain believed they would not risk offending the Three Tigers Gang for a matter that did not concern them. After all, they were mostly cultivators who had not yet grasped the Dao, and their combat prowess was no match for the local cultivators of the Dao Realm.</p><p></p><p>As for Lü Changsheng, the captain knew that such a supreme figure would not act without his own interests being involved, as evidenced by his previous words.</p><p></p><p>The captain's previous actions were likely seen as just a room rental fee in Lü Changsheng's eyes.</p><p></p><p>So, as long as the Three Tigers Gang did not offend the Azure Robe Lord, he would not intervene on the Sea Transport Guild's behalf. The captain understood this well - the world of cultivators was indeed quite normal.</p><p></p><p>Even though to a Dao Realm expert like the Azure Robe Lord, the Three Tigers Gang could be easily destroyed with a flick of the wrist.</p><p></p><p>After this analysis, the captain realized that it was not the right time to confront the Three Tigers Gang. He would report the matter to the higher-ups later, and let the Guild handle it.</p><p></p><p>Hearing the captain's words, the members of the Three Tigers Gang all nodded, feeling that it made sense. After all, the people from the Sea Transport Guild had just arrived on the island with these monks, so how could they know anything?</p><p></p><p>"Alright, we've taken up enough of your time. We'll take our leave."</p><p></p><p>The leader of the Three Tigers Gang group did not linger, simply cupping his hands in farewell and disappearing into the darkness, heading in a different direction.</p><p></p><p>...</p><p></p><p>Eternal Night Island was vast, its expanse akin to an entire country.</p><p></p><p>As Lü Changsheng and the others flew at a leisurely pace, they finally reached the core city of Eternal Night Island - Eternal Night City - after about half an hour.</p><p></p><p>The Three Tigers Gang and two other major factions were entrenched within Eternal Night City, dividing the land among themselves.</p><p></p><p>Just as Lü Changsheng and the captain's group entered the city, they were once again accosted by members of the Three Tigers Gang, who, upon seeing the attire of the Sea Transport Guild, had a slight change in expression and hastily asked...</p><p></p><p>Here is the full English translation of the Chinese excerpt:</p><p></p><p>"Hehe, it seems that this Big Bear Hall Master has quite a high position in the Three Tigers Gang, one wave after another..."</p><p></p><p>"That's right, from the moment we entered the city, we've been asked about it so many times. Hehe, it's just a pity..."</p><p></p><p>"Pity what?"</p><p></p><p>"Hehe, it's a pity that this Big Bear Hall Master and the rest of the Three Tigers Gang members have been completely wiped out by the Grandmaster. The Three Tigers Gang can't find any clues at all, so it's all been in vain."</p><p></p><p>"Tsk, even if they found clues, what of it? Lord Qingyi is an existence that has mastered the Dao. A single finger could crush the Three Tigers Gang!"</p><p></p><p>"Indeed, if I had Lord Qingyi's strength, the Three Tigers Gang would already be gone, and I could also establish good relations with the Maritime Merchant Guild."</p><p></p><p>"Hehe, that's because your horizons are different."</p><p></p><p>"Huh, what do you mean by that?"</p><p></p><p>"At Lord Qingyi's level, he is one of the peak experts in the Three Thousand Realms. Does he need to establish good relations with the Maritime Merchant Guild? The Three Tigers Gang is no different than ants in his eyes. Unless he's in a bad mood and decides to step on them, at other times, such a figure would just observe as a bystander, unaffected by the affairs."</p><p></p><p>"Listening to you, it does seem that way. The previous maritime demonic cultivator was only dealt with after offending Lord Qingyi, and this matter with the Three Tigers Gang was also just because of the so-called lodging fee, as you said."</p><p></p><p>The cultivators couldn't help but discuss this in whispers as they walked, their gazes occasionally and unconsciously glancing at the leisurely figure with hands behind his back in front of them, their eyes filled with awe, reverence, and deep curiosity.</p><p></p><p>They really wanted to know which peak force this unheard-of Lord Qingyi came from.</p><p></p><p>Or could it be that he was a wandering cultivator?</p><p></p><p>While they were lost in speculation, the ship captain suddenly turned around and looked at the cultivators with surprise, smiling and saying, "Why are you all still following? We've arrived at Eternal Night City now, everyone should go their separate ways. We'll be staying on Eternal Night Island for three days, and we'll gather outside Eternal Night City in three days."</p><p></p><p>The cultivators responded in acknowledgment and one by one paid their respects to Luchang Sheng before leaving.</p><p></p><p>Only Chen Pang, Xiao Chai, and the two elves, Qing and Ling, remained.</p><p></p><p>"Milord, you can go about your business. We'll go resupply with the crew first."</p><p></p><p>The captain, understanding the situation, respectfully withdrew with a few crew members.</p><p></p><p>Afterward, Chen Pang and Xiao Chai also left after paying their respects.</p><p></p><p>But the two elves silently followed behind Luchang Sheng.</p><p></p><p>Although they were beautiful elves, the black robes made it difficult for the passing cultivators to notice them.</p><p></p><p>Luchang Sheng suddenly paused in his steps and indifferently said, "What are you two little elves following me for?"</p><p></p><p>Qing and Ling trembled, and Ling quickly said respectfully, "Milord, if you have any needs, please feel free to command us."</p><p></p><p>As elves, they were well aware of what it meant to be an Dao Attainment expert!</p><p></p><p>Such a supreme figure, of course, should be well-served.</p><p></p><p>And... regarding what Luchang Sheng had previously said about being good friends with Chu You...</p><p></p><p>They no longer believed it.</p><p></p><p>Although Chu You was the Third Light Disciple, what virtue or ability could he have to befriend an Dao Attainment expert?</p><p></p><p>Qing and Ling had a guess that Lord Qingyi and Chu You were probably not really good friends, but more likely "sworn brothers in life and death."</p><p></p><p>Whenever they thought of this, Qing and Ling felt a sense of bitterness in their hearts. The Chu Clan... had gotten into big trouble.</p><p></p><p>Luchang Sheng tilted his head and gave them a sidelong glance: "I don't need you. If you keep following me, I won't be responsible for whether you're elves or not..."</p><p></p><p>With that, Luchang Sheng strode away, disappearing into the street.</p><p></p><p>Qing and Ling were frightened, their faces turning deathly pale, and they stood there rigidly, not daring to move for a long time. Only after a while did they exchange a fearful glance.</p>

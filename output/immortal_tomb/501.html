        <h1>Chapter 501</h1>
        <div class="content">
            <p>Here is the full English translation of the Chinese excerpt:</p><p></p><p>Rumble!</p><p></p><p>The sky and earth grew dark, the space trembled, and the surrounding seas were whipped into towering prehistoric waves over a thousand feet high, surging towards the continent like ferocious beasts.</p><p></p><p>Amidst the towering waves, one could vaguely see the silhouettes of many monsters - all the strange creatures from the Realm of the Laws were being carried by the waves towards the continent, though fortunately they had not yet arrived.</p><p></p><p>Faced with this sudden crisis, the various forces on the continent immediately dispatched countless personnel to the edge of the continent, joining forces to erect a lawful spatial barrier, hoping to forcibly block the giant waves.</p><p></p><p>If no measures were taken to obstruct them, the continent would be completely submerged!</p><p></p><p>Once submerged, it would be easily invaded by the countless bizarre monsters from the depths.</p><p></p><p>The Realm of the Laws is the most mysterious existence in the Three Thousand Realms, with even the nine great powers relying on it for survival.</p><p></p><p>The forces on this continent almost all knew that the things lurking beneath the Realm of the Laws were the true overlords of the Three Thousand Realms.</p><p></p><p>Even the Five Great Arcane Masters were powerless against what lay beneath the sea.</p><p></p><p>"What on earth has happened? Why is the space shaking so violently?"</p><p></p><p>"With such a strange event occurring, why haven't we heard any messages from the clan leaders?"</p><p></p><p>"After all, it's a ceremony, so the leaders of the major forces are probably just caught up in a critical discussion."</p><p></p><p>"Nonsense, these giant waves come from the Realm of the Laws. Without the clan leaders present, we may not be able to hold them back on our own!"</p><p></p><p>"The continent is about to be submerged, why haven't any disciples from the Chu Clan come over?"</p><p></p><p>"How strange, the sky is clear on our side, but you look at the sky over the Chu Clan, it's covered by a huge black cloud! It seems to have enveloped the entire Chu Clan!"</p><p></p><p>"Yes, and that cloud seems to be descending, it's a bit creepy."</p><p></p><p>Whoosh whoosh whooshâ€”</p><p></p><p>As they were discussing, a gale strong enough to easily snap trees in half suddenly blew in from the direction of the Chu Clan!</p><p></p><p>"What a powerful wind."</p><p></p><p>"Yes, it's coming from the Chu Clan's direction."</p><p></p><p>"No, wait a moment!"</p><p></p><p>At this time, a cultivator's robes fluttered as he changed expression while gazing at the huge cloud over the Chu Clan. He then swiftly flew up into the sky!</p><p></p><p>The cultivator hurriedly looked down towards the Chu Clan, and his pupils suddenly shrank in shock.</p><p></p><p>Taking a deep breath, he flashed back down to the ground.</p><p></p><p>The others looked at him with puzzled expressions, and some were about to speak, but he solemnly said, "That 'cloud' over the Chu Clan is not a cloud at all, but a gigantic hand precisely covering the Chu Clan!"</p><p></p><p>"The violent gale is being formed by that huge hand as it presses down on the Chu Clan!"</p><p></p><p>What?!</p><p></p><p>This news immediately horrified everyone.</p><p></p><p>The next moment, countless cultivators took to the skies, gazing towards the Chu Clan, and were indeed shocked to see that the so-called "cloud" was truly a massive hand!</p><p></p><p>A powerful expert was attacking the Chu Clan!</p><p></p><p>...</p><p></p><p>At the same time, in the Chu Clan, the commotion and sudden darkening of the sky had caught the attention of all the Chu Clan disciples.</p><p></p><p>When they looked up, they were left dumbfounded, with fear rapidly spreading in their hearts.</p><p></p><p>Someone hurriedly tried to contact the Chu Clan Leader and the others who were at the Elf Clan, but they found with growing anxiety that no one was responding on the other end.</p><p></p><p>"Everyone, retreat back to the clan and activate the protective formations!"</p><p></p><p>Suddenly, an aged voice resounded across the sky.</p><p></p><p>The Chu Clan disciples were startled, looking up to see an old man standing there with hands clasped behind his back, gazing up at the sky.</p><p></p><p>The Patriarch!</p><p></p><p>Seeing this, the Chu Clan disciples were filled with relief, finally having a pillar of support.</p><p></p><p>Thereafter, all the Chu Clan disciples outside hurried to obey the order.</p><p></p><p>Here is my translation of the Chinese excerpt:</p><p></p><p>Returning to the Chu clan, after activating the defensive formation, they all looked up in horror at the boundless giant hand in the sky!</p><p></p><p>The giant hand precisely covered their Chu clan's territory of millions of miles, its five fingers spread wide, exuding an ancient aura as if it had existed since time immemorial!</p><p></p><p>Fortunately, they had the Patriarch, who was a Radiant Saint among the five Profound Mysteries Masters of the Three Thousand Realms.</p><p></p><p>The Patriarch should be able to easily block this terrifying palm. After all, this hand only covered an area of millions of miles, though its momentum was grand, it was not truly invincible.</p><p></p><p>As a Radiant Saint, their Patriarch could influence the entire boundless Three Thousand Realms with just a single hand of the Principle of Light, if he so wished.</p><p></p><p>Comparing the two, the victory was already decided in their minds.</p><p></p><p>The young disciples of the Chu clan were being overly optimistic, but the Patriarch of the Chu clan, facing the giant hand alone in the vast heavens like an ant, had a grave expression, an extremely grave one!</p><p></p><p>Because... the giant hand in front of them had solidified into a tangible form!</p><p></p><p>The Patriarch of the Chu clan was confident in his ability to manifest a palm covering such a vast area, but to make it this real, he could not do it, he simply could not!</p><p></p><p>In that moment of contemplation, </p><p></p><p>a dazzling white light flashed on the Patriarch's forehead!</p><p></p><p>Immediately, countless light arcs like lightning spread from that white light, covering his entire body, like a spider web.</p><p></p><p>The Patriarch's body gradually became transparent, his internal organs, meridians, bones, and the flow of blood all clearly visible from the outside, as his entire being radiated an unparalleled brilliance.</p><p></p><p>The Patriarch's long white hair flowed freely as he looked up to the sky. </p><p></p><p>In that moment, he was like a sun!</p><p></p><p>Emanating from the Patriarch, a mysterious aura permeated the entire Three Thousand Realms.</p><p></p><p>Towering radiance filled the heavens, whether it was the Sea of Principles or the land, countless living beings were stunned by the light in the sky.</p><p></p><p>That Principle of Light, reaching the pinnacle, was so dense it was staggering!</p><p></p><p>In less than a few breaths, the entire Three Thousand Realms seemed to be enveloped in the light, as if the Principle of Light had become the absolute sovereign in that moment.</p><p></p><p>"A Profound Mystery! This is the Profound Mystery of Light! The only one who has mastered the Profound Mystery of Light in the Three Thousand Realms is the Radiant Saint of the Chu clan!"</p><p></p><p>"What's going on, is it a great battle between Profound Mystery Masters?"</p><p></p><p>"......"</p><p></p><p>At the same time, the countless disciples of the Chu clan, seeing their Patriarch shining like the sun in the sky, were exhilarated beyond measure!</p><p></p><p>In the Elven Realm, the assembled experts were still kneeling, with Chu Yu still under the foot of Long Shengsheng.</p><p></p><p>The experts were stunned by the scene, the brilliance dazzling, the white light almost piercing through.</p><p></p><p>Even the Chamber of Commerce Chairman and the Saintly King of the Continent were sucking in cold breaths!</p><p></p><p>Didn't they say the Patriarch of the Chu clan was near the end of his lifespan and about to perish?</p><p></p><p>Now, what is this situation, this Profound Mystery, it actually surpasses their own understanding!</p><p></p><p>In other words, the Patriarch of the Chu clan's Profound Mystery is far beyond theirs!</p><p></p><p>The Chu clan members were also amazed and delighted. They never imagined their Patriarch had hidden such depths!</p><p></p><p>There is hope now, there is hope!</p><p></p><p>As long as they get through this calamity and defeat this young man in green, the Chu clan will undoubtedly become the preeminent force in the Three Thousand Realms!</p><p></p><p>Chu Yu stared at the scene, his expression gradually becoming distorted, and he exclaimed excitedly:</p><p></p><p>"Hehe!! Long Shengsheng, you could never have imagined that my Chu clan's Patriarch has already mastered the Profound Mystery to such a level, huh? One mistake after another, you've miscalculated, Long Shengsheng!"</p>

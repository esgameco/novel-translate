        <h1>Chapter 161</h1>
        <div class="content">
            <p>Here is the full English translation of the excerpt from the Chinese novel:</p><p></p><p>The crowd on the stage kept growing, originally there were only a few hundred people, but now it had already developed into a crowd of nearly a thousand, with many cultivators and young ladies from the Red Boudoir House also coming over.</p><p></p><p>Seeing the pointing and cursing of the crowd, she became flustered.</p><p></p><p>But LÃ¼ Changsheng still stood in the crowd, smiling and watching the lively scene, while Peng Fang, that fat guy, had a somewhat pitiful gaze towards the red carp on the stage.</p><p></p><p>"Oh, dear guests, don't be angry, everyone is here to have fun at the Red Boudoir House, getting angry is not good at all."</p><p></p><p>Finally, a woman holding a round fan appeared in the crowd, smiling and soothing the situation.</p><p></p><p>Seeing the madam of the Red Boudoir House finally appear, the crowd started accusing her,</p><p></p><p>"Hmph, madam, don't we all know we're here to have fun? But what's going on with your Red Boudoir House today? You actually brought out this kind of girl, saying something about being a pure entertainer, not selling her body? Pah!"</p><p></p><p>"That's right, we're all old customers here, the dance troupe had us all fired up, but in the end this red carp girl said she won't entertain customers? What kind of logic is that!"</p><p></p><p>"Refund! Refund!"</p><p></p><p>"Fellow daoists, we can just go to other brothels, this Red Boudoir House with such poor service, let's just let it go bankrupt!"</p><p></p><p>"Yes, this is the Black Calamity Domain, how could they treat us this way, impossible!"</p><p></p><p>"......"</p><p></p><p>In this atmosphere, many other customers were also infected, criticizing the madam.</p><p></p><p>As fellow customers, they were all in the same boat.</p><p></p><p>Seeing this, many of the girls from the Red Boudoir House grew anxious, all glaring resentfully at the red carp on the stage.</p><p></p><p>The madam fluttered her fan, smiling apologetically, "Oh dear, this is indeed a negligence of my Red Boudoir House, I understand the feelings of all the guests, it's just... it's just......"</p><p></p><p>Hearing this, the crowd paused, just what?</p><p></p><p>"It's just that the red carp is only one person, while there are so many of you who enjoyed the dance just now, she wants to accompany you all but is simply unable to. I'm sure the red carp just now was considering the feelings of all the guests, and compromised in that way, it's just that she's new to this, so the method was a bit inappropriate, please don't blame the guests..."</p><p></p><p>The madam explained with a smile.</p><p></p><p>Hearing this, the crowd couldn't help but furrow their brows, looking towards the red carp, could it really be like that?</p><p></p><p>Did this red carp girl say that to make everyone feel more fair?</p><p></p><p>According to the madam's words, they were the ones in the wrong?</p><p></p><p>But very quickly, the crowd reacted, shaking their heads, bullshit!</p><p></p><p>The madam really was a madam, almost tricking them with a few words.</p><p></p><p>"Hmph, madam, we naturally don't want the red carp girl to serve us all, as long as she chooses one of us to serve, we as customers, just want an attitude!"</p><p></p><p>"That's right, among the many who watched the dance just now, the red carp girl must choose one fellow daoist to serve, we just want an attitude."</p><p></p><p>"......"</p><p></p><p>The crowd was in an uproar, looking down on her with disdain.</p><p></p><p>Since this red carp has come to this Red Boudoir House, wanting to both earn money and not lose her virginity? Ridiculous!</p><p></p><p>At this juncture, as for who she chooses, they really didn't care much, it was just a matter of envy, but the attitude must be proper.</p><p></p><p>When did brothel girls think they could ride on the heads of their customers?</p><p></p><p>Seeing this, the madam sighed inwardly, also knowing that these people were not easy to fool, so she looked at the helpless red carp on the stage, her gaze flashing with a command:</p><p></p><p>"Red carp, you must choose one guest to spend the night with."</p><p></p><p>After saying this, she transmitted a message to her, "Don't hesitate, my Red Boudoir House has always been highly praised, but today you have made such a big mistake, you must make amends."</p><p></p><p>Seeing the madam say this, the crowd finally...</p><p></p><p>Here is the full English translation of the excerpt:</p><p></p><p>She calmed down a bit, then looked at the red carp excitedly, her eyes gleaming with greed.</p><p></p><p>Being selected, of course, would be wonderful.</p><p></p><p>Although this red carp was a first-timer, the price should be quite expensive, so be it.</p><p></p><p>At this moment, the red carp's heart was in turmoil, but it soon turned to despair.</p><p></p><p>She knew that from the moment she was sold into the Black Abyss Domain, she could no longer resist.</p><p></p><p>Soon, she scanned the many cultivators present, and since she had to choose one, she naturally wanted to choose a handsome and pleasing one.</p><p></p><p>In an instant, her gaze fixed on a quiet young man in a blue robe in the corner of the crowd.</p><p></p><p>With just one glance, she found it hard to take her eyes off him.</p><p></p><p>When Luchang Sheng saw her gaze resting on him, he couldn't help but raise an eyebrow.</p><p></p><p>Peng Fang initially thought the red carp had taken a liking to him, the fat one, and was excited for a moment, but then he realized her gaze seemed to be focused on the shopkeeper next to him, and he smiled bitterly.</p><p></p><p>"Has the Miss Red Carp made her choice?"</p><p></p><p>The madam and the others couldn't help but follow the red carp's gaze, and they saw a handsome young man in a blue robe standing there.</p><p></p><p>Suddenly, all eyes in the room were focused on Luchang Sheng.</p><p></p><p>"Red Carp, is this the gentleman you have chosen?" the madam asked with a gleam in her eye, her brow relaxed.</p><p></p><p>She inwardly sighed that this girl had good taste, this young man in blue was indeed very handsome.</p><p></p><p>His aura was somewhat different from the ordinary people in the Black Abyss Domain.</p><p></p><p>Thinking about it, she even had bedroom eyes.</p><p></p><p>Red Carp pursed her lips and nodded.</p><p></p><p>"The... the shopkeeper?! "</p><p></p><p>"It really is the shopkeeper! Heavens, the shopkeeper has actually come to the Red Chamber today!"</p><p></p><p>"......"</p><p></p><p>At this moment, the scene became chaotic, and many cultivators who had been to Longsheng Inn exclaimed.</p><p></p><p>"Ah, fellow Daoist, what shopkeeper? We don't understand what you're saying."</p><p></p><p>"......"</p><p></p><p>But there were still many people with puzzled and doubtful expressions.</p><p></p><p>"Hehe, what shopkeeper? Recently, there's an inn in Qingxuan Town that's extremely popular, even the Lord of the Tian She Manor is the doorman there, and you say it's the shopkeeper?!"</p><p></p><p>Longsheng Inn!!</p><p></p><p>The crowd suddenly realized, looking at Luchang Sheng with unbelieving eyes.</p><p></p><p>This... is actually the shopkeeper of Longsheng Inn?</p><p></p><p>They were still in shock when another large group of cultivators flooded into the Red Chamber.</p><p></p><p>"Where's the shopkeeper? You said he came to the Red Chamber, but I don't see the shopkeeper anywhere."</p><p></p><p>"Ah, we're not lying to you, quickly, find the shopkeeper, if you get on good terms with the shopkeeper, maybe you can get a backdoor to drink the Xiwang Liquor in the future, hehe!"</p><p></p><p>"Damn it! The people in the back, can you stop pushing? The Red Chamber isn't that big, you'll burst it if you all crowd in!"</p><p></p><p>"Found him! Wow, the shopkeeper is over there!"</p><p></p><p>"......"</p><p></p><p>The voices rang out without interruption.</p><p></p><p>Seeing the Red Chamber filling up at an unparalleled speed, the madam and the girls were both surprised, delighted, and anxious.</p><p></p><p>When had their Red Chamber ever been so full before?</p><p></p><p>This further proved that this young man in blue was indeed the shopkeeper of Longsheng Inn.</p><p></p><p>But when the madam recalled Red Carp's earlier choice and her own words, her face suddenly turned deathly pale.</p><p></p><p>This... this is offending him, isn't it?</p><p></p><p>Red Carp was also frightened, her eyes trembling, her heart suddenly tightening!</p><p></p><p>She never expected that the man she had chosen at first sight was the legendary shopkeeper of Longsheng Inn...</p><p></p><p>The number one figure in Qingxuan!</p>

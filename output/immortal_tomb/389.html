        <h1>Chapter 389</h1>
        <div class="content">
            <p>Here is the full English translation of the Chinese excerpt:</p><p></p><p>"Ouch!"</p><p></p><p>The old turtle was kicked by Lu Changsheng and embedded into the great mountain.</p><p></p><p>Seeing this, Hunhui burst into loud laughter, in a very good mood.</p><p></p><p>Soon, the old turtle came back, covered in dirt and grime, glaring hatefully at Hunhui.</p><p></p><p>Hunhui pretended not to notice, then turned to Lu Changsheng and bowed, saying, "Immortal Emperor Changsheng, then I shall return to the Underworld."</p><p></p><p>Lu Changsheng nodded with a smile.</p><p></p><p>Hunhui turned around, paused, and said in a deep voice, "Immortal Emperor Changsheng, that Reincarnation Demon Child... no one knows its origins, so I must trouble you to guard and suppress it for now. If it were to escape, the boundless void would be thrown into chaos and calamity."</p><p></p><p>As for the boundless void, Hunhui actually didn't care too much about it. The main concern was that if the Demon Child escaped, the order of the Underworld would be completely disrupted.</p><p></p><p>Lu Changsheng's eyes flashed as he asked, "Since no one knows its origins, why do you call it the Reincarnation Demon Child?"</p><p></p><p>The old turtle, listening to the conversation between Lu Changsheng and Hunhui, was completely bewildered. What was this Reincarnation Demon Child? He felt like he had heard of it somewhere before, but couldn't recall.</p><p></p><p>Hunhui turned around and looked at Lu Changsheng, sighing, "I'm not very clear on the details either. This was information passed down from the previous Underworld Emperor."</p><p></p><p>Oh? The previous Underworld Emperor? That was quite a long time ago.</p><p></p><p>Lu Changsheng's gaze was profound, lost in thought. He suddenly asked, "Did the previous Underworld Emperor say anything else?"</p><p></p><p>Hunhui was silent for a moment, then replied, "He also said that the Reincarnation Demon Child is extremely cunning and adept at disguise, and its power... seems to grow stronger with the passage of time."</p><p></p><p>Hearing this, Lu Changsheng's brow furrowed slightly.</p><p></p><p>Grow stronger with the passage of time?</p><p></p><p>This sounded a lot like his own Eternal Life Physique.</p><p></p><p>And if the Demon Child's power truly grew stronger over time, then was everything it had done in the tower just a facade?</p><p></p><p>Seeing Lu Changsheng deep in thought, Hunhui's eyes flickered as he said, "If Immortal Emperor Changsheng finds it troublesome, why not have us suppress it in the Underworld?"</p><p></p><p>Hunhui was confident in his own abilities. As long as it was within the Underworld's domain, eliminating the Reincarnation Demon Child might be difficult, but suppressing it should not be a problem.</p><p></p><p>And as for Lu Changsheng's true strength, Hunhui was not entirely sure, so having Lu Changsheng suppress it himself would be the most reassuring.</p><p></p><p>Lu Changsheng could see that Hunhui was not entirely at ease, and he understood. After all, this was a matter of great importance to Hunhui.</p><p></p><p>He then said, "Very well, then let us suppress it in your Underworld. I would be glad to be relieved of this burden."</p><p></p><p>Hunhui felt relieved, and smiled, "Then may I trouble Immortal Emperor Changsheng to accompany me to the Underworld?"</p><p></p><p>Lu Changsheng fell silent for a moment.</p><p></p><p>Hunhui immediately knew what Lu Changsheng was thinking, and said lightly, "Immortal Emperor Changsheng, are you concerned about the pressure from the myriad tribes? You need not worry. When I first came to the Divine-Demon Battlefield, I had inquired about it. The myriad tribes have not yet arrived, as the Celestial Lord is currently in a critical stage of cultivation, and the top ten tribes are all preoccupied with their own affairs. So the Human Tribe will not be in danger for the time being, giving us ample time to suppress the Demon Child."</p><p></p><p>"Very well, let us depart," Lu Changsheng said with a smile.</p><p></p><p>"Master, what about the old turtle?" the old turtle quickly asked.</p><p></p><p>Lu Changsheng glanced at him and said, "You go to the Heavenly City and find Jian Wuhui. They will feel more at ease when they see you."</p><p></p><p>With that, Lu Changsheng and Hunhui exchanged a look, nodded, and vanished from the Divine-Demon Battlefield.</p><p></p><p>The old turtle watched the empty air, let out a sigh, and silently headed towards the Heavenly City.</p><p></p><p>...</p><p></p><p>Half a year passed, and there was still no movement from the myriad tribes.</p><p></p><p>The people bound on the Heavenly City were starting to feel numb, their expressions growing increasingly haggard.</p><p></p><p>Here is the full English translation of the Chinese excerpt:</p><p></p><p>Despite our status and position, we are bound here, put on display for the human ants to gaze upon day after day.</p><p></p><p>Although only nine months have passed, which would normally be a very short time, in this situation it has been an agonizing ordeal.</p><p></p><p>They even wonder in their hearts, could it be that the ten tribes truly fear the human blue-robed cultivators?</p><p></p><p>Meanwhile, in the Dragon Clan.</p><p></p><p>In the main hall, the Dragon Clan Chief Ao Zhengtian sat restlessly.</p><p></p><p>On both sides of the hall were the Dragon Clan's senior members, including the Holy Son Ao Xing.</p><p></p><p>"Chief, it's been nine months already, but we still haven't seen any movement from the ten tribes. Why is that?" </p><p></p><p>Ao Xing looked up at the seated Ao Zhengtian and asked respectfully. </p><p></p><p>Although Ao Xing was Ao Zhengtian's son, in this solemn setting he addressed him as the Clan Chief.</p><p></p><p>A solemn expression crossed Ao Zhengtian's stern face as he said, "Shen Ting is now at a critical juncture in his cultivation."</p><p></p><p>Ao Xing's body trembled, and a look of alarm appeared in his eyes. If the Divine Thunderer had reached a critical point in his cultivation, could it be that...?</p><p></p><p>Ao Zhengtian nodded solemnly. "Xing'er, as you've guessed, if Shen Ting succeeds this time, he will become the first Divine Realm cultivator in the history of the Demon-God Battlefield."</p><p></p><p>Divine Realm! </p><p></p><p>Ao Xing and the elders' pupils shrank, their faces paling.</p><p></p><p>The Divine Mystery Realm was already considered a powerful presence on the Demon-God Battlefield, and the Divine Seclusion Realm was a formidable force.</p><p></p><p>But beyond that, there was the Divine Martial Realm, and only after that came the Divine Realm!</p><p></p><p>The top thirty on the individual combat power ranking were mostly Divine Martial Realm experts, with the remaining seventy being peak Divine Seclusion Realm.</p><p></p><p>Cultivators like the Divine Thunderer Shen Ting and Clan Chief Ao Zhengtian were generally mid to late Divine Martial Realm.</p><p></p><p>And now, Clan Chief Ao had sensed Shen Ting reaching the Divine Realm...</p><p></p><p>The Divine Realm, a legendary realm - how overwhelmingly powerful could it be?</p><p></p><p>No one knew the true extent of the Divine Realm's strength.</p><p></p><p>"Chief, how did the Divine Thunderer manage to touch upon that realm?" an elder asked in a hoarse voice.</p><p></p><p>Ao Zhengtian slowly rose from his seat, shaking his head. "I don't know. This news was only relayed to me by my secret agent in the Divine Tribe. Shen Ting's ambition is truly unfathomable."</p><p></p><p>Ao Xing spoke gravely, "Chief, if the Divine Thunderer truly breaks through to the Divine Realm... won't the Demon-God Battlefield become completely dominated by the Divine Tribe?"</p><p></p><p>Currently, while the Divine Tribe was the strongest of the ten tribes, they did not have an overwhelming advantage. This could be seen from how Shen Luo had shown some courtesy to Ao Xing and Bi Qiong.</p><p></p><p>Otherwise, with Shen Luo's arrogant nature, he would never have given them any face.</p><p></p><p>Ao Zhengtian sighed helplessly. "Yes... The other eight tribal chiefs also know of this matter. Now their attention is focused on the Divine Tribe, relegating the human tribe to a secondary concern. Although no one can say for certain whether Shen Ting will succeed, if he does breakthrough, it will be a devastating blow to all the tribes."</p><p></p><p>After all, everyone knew what it meant for someone to reach the Divine Realm.</p><p></p><p>In terms of individual combat power, Shen Ting was already ranked number one. If he were to break through to the Divine Realm, the imagination could hardly fathom his might.</p><p></p><p>Ao Xing's eyes flickered as he asked, "Chief, what plans do the other eight tribal chiefs have? Surely they won't just watch as the Divine Thunderer breaks through?"</p><p></p><p>Ao Xing's implication was clear...</p><p></p><p>"Chief, the Devouring Beast Tribe has sent an invitation, requesting your presence for a meeting."</p><p></p><p>At this moment, a voice rang out from outside the hall.</p>

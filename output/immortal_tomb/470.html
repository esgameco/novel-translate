        <h1>Chapter 470</h1>
        <div class="content">
            <p>Here is the full English translation of the Chinese excerpt:</p><p></p><p>The moment the incarnation of the Heavenly Dao was dispersed by Lu Changsheng, the entire Qiankunluo (the Heavens and the Earth) began to rain a misty blood rain.</p><p></p><p>Evidently, with the incarnation of the Heavenly Dao being dispersed, the origin of the Heavenly Dao itself had also suffered damage.</p><p></p><p>The living beings from all regions were anxiously watching the scene unfolding before them.</p><p></p><p>First, a terrifying radiance obscured the sky, and then the strange blood rain began to fall. The living beings truly did not know what had happened in the Qiankunluo.</p><p></p><p>For a moment, all beings felt that the end of the world had come, and that the Qiankunluo was no longer a place to stay.</p><p></p><p>In the Hollow Ancient Realm, the He Clan.</p><p></p><p>Hong Wanjun and many other powerful experts were bathing in the blood rain, their pupils constricting to needles, and their souls trembling.</p><p></p><p>The powerful incarnation of the Heavenly Dao, the young man in blue, was truly dispersed with just a slap, without the slightest hesitation...</p><p></p><p>Soon, the weak voice of the Heavenly Dao resounded in the sky:</p><p></p><p>"Great... Great One, the Heavenly Dao had no other intentions, it just wanted to help you with the work..."</p><p></p><p>Lu Changsheng's gaze was still fixed on the currently silent black-robed person, and he said softly,</p><p></p><p>"If you don't leave immediately, I won't mind replacing the Heavenly Dao of the Qiankunluo."</p><p></p><p>"The Heavenly Dao is retreating."</p><p></p><p>The Heavenly Dao seemed to be frightened by Lu Changsheng's words and posture, and after a respectful farewell, it disappeared without a trace.</p><p></p><p>The moment the Heavenly Dao fled, the unique pressure of the Heavenly Dao also receded like the tide.</p><p></p><p>At this moment, the sky and earth were silent, only the pitter-patter of the blood rain.</p><p></p><p>Many ancient clans were like petrified, standing in the blood rain, not daring to move, not even daring to deploy barriers to block the blood rain, only allowing themselves to be drenched by it.</p><p></p><p>There was no way around it, the oppressive aura of the young man in blue had reached its peak!</p><p></p><p>This terrifying oppressive feeling made everyone suffocate, even more unbearable than the previous experience in the Refining Heaven Formation.</p><p></p><p>Lu Changsheng stood in place with his hands behind his back, he was the only one in the entire scene who was completely clean and unstained by blood.</p><p></p><p>Even though it was raining blood from the sky at the moment, the countless blood drops seemed to encounter a great terror when they were about to fall on Lu Changsheng, and hastily avoided him.</p><p></p><p>"Cough, cough, Lu Changsheng, you are truly a monster... Hehe."</p><p></p><p>The black-robed person, who was pinned to the cliff, suddenly coughed up a mouthful of blood, but his expression was filled with a sense of ease.</p><p></p><p>Lu Changsheng's gaze remained calm, and with a casual wave of his sleeve, the black-robed person's hood was lifted, revealing his true face to the crowd.</p><p></p><p>It was also a young man, with delicate features, his hair a mix of white and black, with a luminous mark on his forehead, and a pair of narrow, shining eyes.</p><p></p><p>It was hard for the onlookers to imagine that the ruthless black-robed person was actually such a delicate-looking young man.</p><p></p><p>Although Chu Yu was currently in a disheveled state, with blood at the corners of his mouth, he still had a cruel smile on his face:</p><p></p><p>"Lu Changsheng, you haven't attacked me for a long time, have you figured it out...?"</p><p></p><p>The next moment, the body of Chu Yu, who was impaled on the cliff, began to fade like particles.</p><p></p><p>"Lu Changsheng, stay well in the Qiankunluo and wait for me. This grudge of the clone, I must avenge it!!"</p><p></p><p>Chu Yu stared at Lu Changsheng, his voice cold.</p><p></p><p>At the same time, he looked at He Xitong on the top of the Heavenly Pavilion, and a flash of pain and resentment crossed his face!</p><p></p><p>This trip, not only did he not obtain the Myriad Worlds Calamity Body, but he had also lost his most important clone here... He was so angry!</p><p></p><p>"Wait for you?"</p><p></p><p>A mocking light flashed in Lu Changsheng's eyes, and he casually raised a palm to stabilize the dissipating Chu Yu, then his figure moved, and he appeared in front of Chu Yu.</p><p></p><p>"It's just a clone, if you have the guts, then keep it!"</p><p></p><p>Seeing the mysterious young man in blue, a flicker of emotion flashed in Chu Yu's eyes.</p><p></p><p>If this Lu Changsheng really kept his clone, he would be able to better locate Lu Changsheng's position...</p><p></p><p>Here is the full English translation of the Chinese excerpt:</p><p></p><p>When the time comes, I will return with my troops and kill Luchang Sheng. Even if his main body is dead, his clone still exists, which would be the best outcome.</p><p></p><p>Luchang Sheng looked at Chu You inexplicably, and a blue light suddenly flashed in his eyes, instantly seeing through all the memories of this clone of Chu You!</p><p></p><p>Chu You felt as if he had been electrocuted, and the excruciating pain in his mind temporarily plunged him into a blank state.</p><p></p><p>Until he regained his senses and heard Luchang Sheng's words, the murderous intent in his heart suddenly surged!</p><p></p><p>After searching through the memories, a trace of surprise and interest flashed in Luchang Sheng's eyes, and he then smiled and said, "I have a general understanding of where you are, so just clean your neck and wait quietly for my arrival. You and your family don't have much time left, so enjoy it well..."</p><p></p><p>"If you're not afraid of death, come at me. I'll be waiting for you in the Sea of Laws!" Chu You frowned and sneered.</p><p></p><p>Luchang Sheng's mouth curled into a cold smile, and he then slapped towards the top of Chu You's clone's head, accompanied by Chu You's agonizing scream, and the clone was destroyed into nothingness!</p><p></p><p>At the same time, in another boundless void far away from this endless void, in a world within a vast ocean, a remote sea area suddenly churned up towering waves, and dense, chaotic laws of power were raging on the surface of the sea!</p><p></p><p>Behind the huge waves, there was an island. On the beach, a young man was convulsing, rolling, and going mad, hugging a severed head!</p><p></p><p>The young man's body was extremely saturated and disordered with laws, and his breath was very weak!</p><p></p><p>After an unknown period of time, the sea area calmed down.</p><p></p><p>"Huff... huff... huff..."</p><p></p><p>The young man raised his head, his face pale and his eyes bloodshot.</p><p></p><p>With his black and white hair, androgynous features, and the light mark on his forehead, this person was Chu You, whose clone was destroyed by Luchang Sheng in the Qiankun Heavens.</p><p></p><p>"Luchang Sheng..." Chu You narrowed his eyes, his tone low and full of murderous intent.</p><p></p><p>Not only was his clone destroyed, causing Chu You's main body to suffer unbearable pain, but his cultivation also directly dropped by 30%. How could he not be angry and furious?</p><p></p><p>The loss of his cultivation was secondary, even the Laws of Light had been forcibly reduced by 30%!</p><p></p><p>He didn't even obtain the Myriad Worlds Calamity Body. This trip, despite the time, effort, and clone spent, Chu You gained nothing, but paid a heavy price instead!</p><p></p><p>Thinking of this, Chu You could no longer hold back, and he suddenly raised his head towards the boundless sea, roaring, "Luchang Sheng, you better come quickly, because I'm going to make sure you die a horrible death!"</p><p></p><p>After an unknown period of time, Chu You gradually regained his composure, and the fury in his eyes had disappeared.</p><p></p><p>Chu You took out a jade token, looked at it for a long time, and then sent a spiritual energy into it. As the jade token began to glow, he finally said, "The third disciple requests to return to the tribe."</p><p></p><p>"Chu You, has your trial ended?" An elderly voice came from the other side of the jade token.</p><p></p><p>Hearing this, the malicious aura in Chu You's eyes reappeared, but he quickly suppressed his emotions and closed his eyes, replying, "The trial has failed."</p><p></p><p>The other side of the jade token was silent for a long time before saying, "Then come back."</p><p></p><p>"Mm."</p><p></p><p>Chu You put away the jade token, then looked at the boundless Sea of Laws one more time, and then activated the Laws of Light, turning into a beam of light and disappearing from the island.</p><p></p><p>But in Chu You's heart, the name "Luchang Sheng" was being frantically repeated, as if he had been possessed by a demon.</p>

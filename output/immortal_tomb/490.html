            <p>Here is the full English translation of the Chinese excerpt:</p><p></p><p>"Everyone, please pay attention. We are about to arrive at the terminal station, Dengting Island. I am the captain of Ship No. 3 of this sea voyage. I wish you all a smooth understanding of the laws after disembarking."</p><p></p><p>The captain's announcement sounded on Ship No. 3, and from his tone, one could sense that he had let out a sigh of relief.</p><p></p><p>After all, this voyage had first encountered demonic cultivators at sea, and then faced dangers on Yonye Island.</p><p></p><p>This time, fortunately, the Elder was there.</p><p></p><p>On the deck, the cultivators looked at the huge island ahead, their eyes flickering. Whether they would be dragons or insects in the Sea of Laws, and how well they would fare, this trip to Dengting Island was of utmost importance.</p><p></p><p>"Big brother, I'm scared," Chen Pang said with a furrowed brow and a pitiful expression.</p><p></p><p>Xiao Chai opened his mouth, wanting to say some comforting words, but couldn't. He knew what Chen Pang was afraid of.</p><p></p><p>Not just Chen Pang, even Xiao Chai himself was unsure.</p><p></p><p>After all, the captain's introduction about Dengting Island had been too terrifying and frightening a hundred years ago.</p><p></p><p>The waters of Dengting Island were very deep.</p><p></p><p>At this moment, Lu Changsheng and the Old Turtle came to the deck.</p><p></p><p>The cultivators were shocked and hurriedly bowed in salute, "We pay our respects to the Elders."</p><p></p><p>The cultivators stole glances at the Old Turtle, envious to the point of turning purple, green, and black.</p><p></p><p>The cultivators thought the Old Turtle was a local of Yonye Island, but they didn't know why he was so highly regarded by the Elder.</p><p></p><p>To be able to follow in the footsteps of the peak cultivator of the Three Thousand Realms, this was a blessing accumulated over generations!</p><p></p><p>The Old Turtle instantly sensed these gazes and sneered coldly.</p><p></p><p>Grandpa Turtle was the master's only mount, the Immortal Turtle. Although his cultivation had not kept up due to laziness, how could these ordinary mortals compare to him?</p><p></p><p>"Rise, no need for such formalities," Lu Changsheng said with a gentle smile.</p><p></p><p>"Thank you, Elder," the cultivators respectfully straightened up, but inwardly grumbling.</p><p></p><p>If they hadn't seen it with their own eyes, they wouldn't have believed that the young man in green robes was the ruthless master.</p><p></p><p>"Wooooâ€”"</p><p></p><p>The ship's horn sounded, and everyone noticed that the speed of Ship No. 3 had slowed down. They looked over and were instantly awestruck.</p><p></p><p>The island in their line of sight now blocked out the sky, its vastness stretching as far as the eye could see, exuding a mysterious sense of oppression.</p><p></p><p>At the shore, there were countless docked ships, and an endless stream of cultivators crawling about on the land, not ants, but cultivators.</p><p></p><p>Flashes of light occasionally streaked across the island.</p><p></p><p>It was clear that Dengting Island was much more lively and bustling than Yonye Island.</p><p></p><p>At the same time, the approaching Ship No. 3 had also attracted the attention of many cultivators from various forces on the shore.</p><p></p><p>"Ah, more cultivators are about to disembark, that's probably a ship from the Sea Transport Guild."</p><p></p><p>"Yes, the ship must be carrying many cultivators from the mainland, coming to the Sea of Laws to comprehend the laws."</p><p></p><p>"Hehe, the sea transport business between the mainland and the Sea of Laws is almost monopolized by the Sea Transport Guild, they're making a killing."</p><p></p><p>"What can be done? Many forces are envious of this sea transport business, but no one dares to challenge the Sea Transport Guild, after all, their guild leader is a powerhouse."</p><p></p><p>"Enough talk, the ship is about to dock, time for business!"</p><p></p><p>As the cultivators on the shore discussed, Ship No. 3 had already docked.</p><p></p><p>These cultivators were actually waiting here to solicit business, to serve the cultivators who had come to Dengting Island to comprehend the laws.</p><p></p><p>On Ship No. 3, the cultivators avoided eye contact, not daring to look at the people on the shore.</p><p></p><p>They remembered the captain's words, that after disembarking on Dengting Island, they should be cautious in their words and actions, and stay low-key.</p><p></p><p>The captain came to the deck, collected their jade tokens, which were their ship tickets, and then smiled, "Cooperation complete, everyone can disembark."</p><p></p><p>After sending off this batch, their ship would stay docked on Dengting Island for a while, waiting for passengers.</p><p></p><p>Because every day, there were cultivators who had completed their comprehension of the laws, some of whom would return to the mainland.</p><p></p><p>Once they had gathered enough, Ship No. 3 would set sail again, returning to the mainland.</p><p></p><p>It was impossible for them to sail back empty.</p><p></p><p>The cultivators bowed to the captain, then paid their respects to Lu Changsheng, and nervously disembarked.</p><p></p><p>Chen Pang, Xiao Chai, Qing, and Lin also got off the ship.</p><p></p><p>As soon as they disembarked, they fearfully saw a crowd of cultivators rushing towards them from the shore:</p><p></p><p>"Hehe, fellow Daoists! I am the steward of Xuanlong Sect on this island. I presume you have all come to Dengting Island to comprehend the laws? Our Xuanlong Sect manages an excellent place for comprehending the laws, and many cultivators who have come here have already attained remarkable insights into the laws!"</p><p></p><p>"Tch, Xuanlong Sect, the name sounds impressive, but I've never heard of it. What makes you think your place for comprehending the laws is so special?"</p><p></p><p>Here is the full English translation of the Chinese excerpt:</p><p></p><p>"There's such a sect on the Sky Island? Since I've never heard of it, it must be a trash sect that's not worth mentioning!"</p><p></p><p>"Everyone, why don't you come to my Blood Wolf Clan? To be honest, while the Blood Wolf Clan may not be one of the top powers on the island, we are still among the middle-tier forces. I believe you will find our Enlightenment Grounds quite to your liking."</p><p></p><p>"The Blood Wolf Clan isn't bad, but the Holy Light Sect isn't bad either. What do you all think?"</p><p></p><p>"......"</p><p></p><p>Chen Pang and Xiao Chai, along with the other cultivators, were a bit dazed, not understanding the meaning behind this.</p><p></p><p>Although they had previously heard from the captain that the powers on the island were complex and monopolized many Enlightenment Grounds, they still couldn't believe what was happening now.</p><p></p><p>Was this a windfall from the heavens? Were they being offered free Enlightenment?</p><p></p><p>Impossible, impossible!</p><p></p><p>Chen Pang, Xiao Chai, and the others shook their heads inwardly.</p><p></p><p>"Senior predecessors, Enlightenment shouldn't be free, right?" </p><p></p><p>One of the cultivators asked cautiously.</p><p></p><p>The cultivators from the various powers were taken aback, and an elder immediately said impatiently:</p><p></p><p>"Hey, little brother, when we take you to good Enlightenment Grounds, of course it's not free! This is the Sea of Principles, not a charity sea!"</p><p></p><p>Hearing this, Chen Pang, Xiao Chai, and the others had bitter expressions, and politely declined:</p><p></p><p>"Senior predecessors, we won't go then. "</p><p></p><p>"Yes, thank you, senior predecessors, for your kindness, but on our way here, we encountered sea demonic cultivators and were robbed of all our belongings..."</p><p></p><p>"......"</p><p></p><p>Upon hearing this, the cultivators from the various powers furrowed their brows, their eyes flashing with disbelief!</p><p></p><p>These land cultivators could still be alive after encountering sea demonic cultivators? Bullshit!</p><p></p><p>So these cultivators were lying!</p><p></p><p>"Hehe, you land cultivators, don't think you can use this excuse to get out of it. I'm telling you, you must go to our Enlightenment Grounds to cultivate the Principles!" </p><p></p><p>"That's right, that's right, or none of you will be leaving!"</p><p></p><p>Seeing this, the cultivators from the various powers no longer pretended, and their footsteps started approaching Chen Pang and the others, gradually forming a surrounding formation.</p><p></p><p>This really frightened Chen Pang and the others!</p><p></p><p>It seems the captain had downplayed the situation - the people on Sky Island were simply unreasonable, forcibly buying and selling!</p><p></p><p>On the Sea Transport No. 3, Lu Changsheng was still standing above, watching this scene with an expressionless face.</p><p></p><p>"Master, these cultivators are quite pitiful," the old turtle shook his head.</p><p></p><p>Lu Changsheng smiled faintly, "If you didn't have me as your backer, your fate wouldn't be much better than theirs."</p><p></p><p>The old turtle's face immediately flushed red, laughing embarrassedly.</p><p></p><p>"The weak are bullied, isn't that normal?" </p><p></p><p>Lu Changsheng said indifferently, but he didn't seem to have any intention of intervening. His gaze just swept over Qinghe and Lin.</p><p></p><p>"Sigh."</p><p></p><p>Beside him, the captain also sighed repeatedly. In fact, he wanted to step out and say a few words to help the land cultivators, but after thinking about it, he had to give up helplessly.</p><p></p><p>After all, they were just passing acquaintances, and he had already warned them so much earlier. He had done his utmost.</p><p></p><p>And most importantly, this was a commonly accepted gray business chain on Sky Island.</p><p></p><p>Even though he was from the Sea Transport Association, he couldn't arbitrarily interfere. If he provoked the wrath of the powers on Sky Island, the Sea Transport Association would also face immense pressure.</p><p></p><p>"Everyone, we came on the same boat as these cultivators, which can prove that what they said is true - they were robbed of their belongings by sea demonic cultivators on the way here," </p><p></p><p>Just as Chen Pang and the others were turning pale, Lin spoke up.</p><p></p><p>"What are you? How dare you try to vouch for them?!" </p><p></p><p>A middle-aged cultivator glared at Lin and shouted angrily.</p><p></p><p>Lin took off her hat cover and smiled politely, "I'm sorry, I'm not just anyone, I'm from the Elf Clan."</p><p></p><p>Elf Clan! The crowd was shocked!</p><p></p><p>The middle-aged cultivator suddenly paused, sensing the unfriendly gazes around him, and his face turned pale.</p><p></p><p>Damn, this is bad!</p><p></p><p>"This person dares to insult the Elf Clan, fellow Daoists, let's destroy him and his faction together!"</p><p></p><p>The next moment, the cultivators from the various powers started shouting, no longer caring about Chen Pang, Xiao Chai, and the others, and instead surrounded and attacked the middle-aged cultivator.</p><p></p><p>Boom, boom...!</p><p></p><p>"Ah, stop hitting, stop hitting! I was wrong!"</p><p></p><p>Chen Pang, Xiao Chai, and the others watched the middle-aged cultivator being beaten, their faces filled with shock.</p><p></p><p>The Elf Clan, they really are powerful!</p>

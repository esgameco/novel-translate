        <h1>Chapter 536</h1>
        <div class="content">
            <p>Here is the full English translation of the Chinese excerpt:</p><p></p><p>At this time.</p><p></p><p>As Lü Changsheng lightly brushed his sleeve on the podium, three items quietly appeared, lying still.</p><p></p><p>A plain and ordinary calligraphy brush.</p><p></p><p>A bundle of red silk cords.</p><p></p><p>A scroll painting with a golden border.</p><p></p><p>Han Yue and the other two were stunned, although they did not know the true purpose of the three items in front of them.</p><p></p><p>But coming from the teacher's hand, they must be priceless treasures!!</p><p></p><p>Who is this teacher? Perhaps the people in the town do not know, but they just saw him clearly!</p><p></p><p>He is a peerless figure that even Masters Lü and Mo have to be careful in serving!</p><p></p><p>"Han Yue, you choose one first."</p><p></p><p>Lü Changsheng said without a doubt.</p><p></p><p>Han Yue and the other two were greatly surprised! The teacher is going to bestow these upon them?</p><p></p><p>It seems that ever since the day he tested their martial veins, everything has changed!!</p><p></p><p>The three even vaguely realized that perhaps the visit of the Tianwu Sect to test their martial veins was a test by the teacher for them.</p><p></p><p>Thinking about it now, it really does seem to be the case!</p><p></p><p>After all, the fifteen martial veins all belong to the students of the Changsheng Academy!</p><p></p><p>"Yes."</p><p></p><p>Han Yue stepped forward and pointed to the calligraphy brush, "Teacher, the student chooses this calligraphy brush."</p><p></p><p>Lü Changsheng nodded, and the brush flew towards Han Yue.</p><p></p><p>Han Yue hurriedly caught it, finding it cool to the touch, just like an ordinary calligraphy brush, and he has not yet felt any special properties.</p><p></p><p>"Xiao Fan, you choose." Lü Changsheng continued.</p><p></p><p>Xiao Fan stepped forward and decisively chose the scroll painting with the golden border.</p><p></p><p>Finally, the bundle of red silk naturally flew into Ye Luoxiao's hands.</p><p></p><p>The three did not dare to carefully examine the treasures in their hands, but instead bowed and waited for Lü Changsheng's next words.</p><p></p><p>Seeing this, Lü Changsheng gently nodded and said:</p><p></p><p>"Han Yue, the item in your hand is called the Mysterious Brush, which can be used for both offense and defense, with profound mastery, and can also deduce all things, but at a cost."</p><p></p><p>"Luoxiao, the red silk in your hand is called the Soulbound Silk Cord, where your thoughts go, the silk will follow, with skilled mastery, it can bind the mountains, seas, and the heavens."</p><p></p><p>"Xiao Fan, the scroll in your hand is called the All-Encompassing Diagram of Heaven and Earth, which can also be used for both offense and defense, and the space within the scroll contains many wonderful uses."</p><p></p><p>"I've only given a simple introduction, and there are more wonderful uses that you need to explore and discover as you grow."</p><p></p><p>After saying this, the teacher smiled faintly.</p><p></p><p>These three items were originally local treasures of the Bookworm Martial Heavens, which he had refined with the essence of the sages and saints of the ages.</p><p></p><p>At this moment, Han Yue and the others were stunned, looking at the items in their hands!!</p><p></p><p>Just from the teacher's description, they knew these were priceless treasures!</p><p></p><p>So powerful!!</p><p></p><p>The three quickly placed the items back on the podium.</p><p></p><p>"Teacher, these priceless treasures, the students cannot wield them, and are not worthy of receiving them!!"</p><p></p><p>Lü Changsheng rubbed his brow and said, "I didn't say I was giving them to you. In the future, if you perform well, I may consider bestowing them, but if you perform in a way that displeases me and tarnishes my reputation, I naturally have ways to take them back. You can just take them and use them for now."</p><p></p><p>These three items were just something he had casually refined for his students in the first place. Taking them back is nothing.</p><p></p><p>These useless trinkets, even if left alone, Lü Changsheng would feel they are taking up space.</p><p></p><p>"Yes..."</p><p></p><p>Han Yue and the others did not dare to say anything else, and silently picked up the treasures, holding them reverently in their arms.</p><p></p><p>"Oh, it's already noon without me realizing. That's enough for today, you go back and take a good look at these booklets, if you have any questions, ask me again tomorrow. There will be no class in the afternoon, I have some matters to attend to."</p><p></p><p>Lü Changsheng casually tossed out three booklets, then turned and left the classroom with his hands behind his back.</p><p></p><p>Han Yue and the others quickly used one hand to catch the booklets, then hurriedly bowed and said, "Farewell, teacher."</p><p></p><p>After Lü Changsheng left, they let out a sigh of relief and looked at the booklets.</p><p></p><p>The top one was the Mastery of Qi Technique!</p><p></p><p>The three swallowed hard, then carefully tucked the booklets into their chests.</p><p></p><p>Han Yue and the others exchanged glances, but they didn't know what to say.</p><p></p><p>Today's events have exceeded their imagination.</p><p></p><p>Fortunately, they were able to enter the teacher's door, this is their extraordinary fate!!</p><p></p><p>They must firmly grasp this opportunity, work hard and strive, and not let the teacher down!!</p><p></p><p>They were shocked, stunned, and their hearts were trembling.</p><p></p><p>Here is the full English translation of the Chinese excerpt:</p><p></p><p>After that, the three of them got excited and became exhilarated. </p><p></p><p>Since the teacher was so strong, they were also excited and felt honored! Moreover, this was a super big shot!</p><p></p><p>......</p><p></p><p>After leaving the school, Luchang Sheng came all the way to Old Xu's noodle shop.</p><p></p><p>It was noon, and the noodle shop had no vacant seats at all, after all, there were only about ten seats in total.</p><p></p><p>Even at the entrance, there were still two people squatting there, holding their bowls of noodles and slurping them up.</p><p></p><p>"Mr. Luchang!"</p><p></p><p>When the customers saw Luchang Sheng arrive, they hurriedly slurped up their noodles even faster.</p><p></p><p>Some customers even stood up holding their bowls of noodles, wanting to go eat at the entrance, but were stopped by Luchang Sheng, who gently pushed them back to their seats.</p><p></p><p>"Everyone, eat slowly, I'm not here to eat noodles."</p><p></p><p>Luchang Sheng smiled gently.</p><p></p><p>Hearing this, the crowd finally breathed a sigh of relief and smiled, slowing down their pace.</p><p></p><p>At this time, Old Xu came out from the back kitchen, rubbing the flour on his hands, and as soon as he saw Luchang Sheng, he hurriedly came over. </p><p></p><p>"Oh, Mr. Luchang, you're here! Do you want to eat the scallion noodles? Old Xu will go cook them right away!"</p><p></p><p>"No, I'm not hungry at the moment." Luchang Sheng smiled slightly.</p><p></p><p>Huh? Not hungry?</p><p></p><p>Old Xu was taken aback and asked puzzledly, "Then, Mr. Luchang, what...?"</p><p></p><p>Luchang Sheng smiled calmly and said, "Old Xu, I'm planning to go fishing, and I came to ask if you'd like to come with me?"</p><p></p><p>Fishing!!</p><p></p><p>Old Xu's eyes suddenly lit up, but when he looked at the customers in the noodle shop, a look of difficulty and struggle flashed in his eyes.</p><p></p><p>"Mr. Luchang, it's noon now, the busiest time of the day for business... I..."</p><p></p><p>"Okay, then I'll go by myself. Noon is when the big fish are the most abundant, it's a pity..."</p><p></p><p>Luchang Sheng shook his head regretfully and sighed, then turned to leave the noodle shop.</p><p></p><p>Noon is when the big fish are the most abundant?!</p><p></p><p>Hearing this, Old Xu suddenly became anxious!!</p><p></p><p>"Mr. Luchang, wait!!" Old Xu gritted his teeth and shouted.</p><p></p><p>"Hmm?" Luchang Sheng, who was just about to leave the noodle shop, turned back with a puzzled look on his face.</p><p></p><p>"Mr. Luchang, I want to go too!" Old Xu said hurriedly.</p><p></p><p>Luchang Sheng was slightly surprised, looked at the customers, and then mysteriously looked at Old Xu. "Aren't you running your business?"</p><p></p><p>"Hehe, the business won't suffer from missing one day!" Old Xu laughed awkwardly, then looked at the customers and repeatedly bowed. "Sorry, everyone, please eat quickly, the noodle shop is closing for the noon break."</p><p></p><p>The customers had already heard the conversation between Old Xu and Luchang Sheng, so they understood. Everyone finished their meal quickly and left after paying.</p><p></p><p>After all, they had already eaten their noon meal, and they didn't care about the people who wanted to come to the noodle shop for lunch but couldn't. </p><p></p><p>Moreover, it wasn't Luchang Sheng forcing Old Xu to go fishing, they all heard clearly that it was Old Xu himself who wanted to go fishing.</p><p></p><p>Ah, this Old Xu, he's starting to neglect his business lately!</p><p></p><p>......</p><p></p><p>Creak!</p><p></p><p>Old Xu locked the noodle shop door and hung up the "Temporarily Closed" sign with a smile.</p><p></p><p>Luchang Sheng stood by, feeling quite amused as he waited.</p><p></p><p>At this time, a few more customers came, first greeting Luchang Sheng, then looking at Old Xu in amazement, "Old Xu, you're not doing business at noon again?!"</p><p></p><p>Damn it, they couldn't even eat noodles in the morning, and now they couldn't eat them at noon either? Who could stand this!</p><p></p><p>"Ah, I have some things to take care of, I'm sorry everyone, come back in the evening to eat!" Old Xu apologized.</p><p></p><p>"Alright, alright." The customers left, feeling quite disappointed, to find something else to eat.</p><p></p><p>After getting everything ready, Old Xu went around the side of the noodle shop and came out again, carrying all the fishing gear, which he had apparently hidden in a discreet corner.</p><p></p><p>He had an excited expression on his face and chuckled, "Mr. Luchang, shall we go?"</p><p></p><p>Luchang Sheng shook his head and smiled, waving his hand, "Let's go."</p>

        <h1>Chapter 548</h1>
        <div class="content">
            <p>Here is the full English translation of the Chinese excerpt:</p><p></p><p>Beside him, the middle-aged man sighed and said with a pursed lip:</p><p></p><p>"Principal, this Yin Quan..."</p><p></p><p>"Hmm, he is a warlord. After the matter is resolved, we still need to be careful about this Yin Quan."  Mei Cangwu waved his hand and said, "Wanshou, to be honest, I'm only slightly stronger than Yin Quan in terms of strength, but in other aspects... I'm not as good as him."</p><p></p><p>The middle-aged man, who was Wanshou, hurriedly said, "Principal, how can Yin Quan be compared to you!"</p><p></p><p>Mei Cangwu waved his hand, "Forget about that, you go and summon all the elders, we're about to set out."</p><p></p><p>Wanshou hesitated, then bowed and said, "Yes."</p><p></p><p>"Phew."</p><p></p><p>Mei Cangwu let out a heavy sigh, his gaze gradually becoming more serious.</p><p></p><p>If everything goes smoothly in dealing with the Tianwu Sect, it would be fine to discuss further. But if any mistakes occur, his Northern Dipper Academy will suffer a heavy blow.</p><p></p><p>He just hopes that after he lures out Bai Jiang, the Daozhen Sect can act quickly.</p><p></p><p>Mei Cangwu stood up, bowed deeply towards the sky with a respectful tone:</p><p></p><p>"Student Mei Cangwu, I hope the teacher will bless this matter to go smoothly."</p><p></p><p>...</p><p></p><p>At the same time.</p><p></p><p>All the sects had already exploded in an uproar!</p><p></p><p>Because the elders who went to Jixiang Town had all returned with serious injuries!</p><p></p><p>The angriest of them was the Tianwu Sect!</p><p></p><p>Tianwu Sect, the main hall.</p><p></p><p>"Outrageous!! Which elder was in charge of Wang Sao and Song Ren?" </p><p></p><p>Bai Jiang stood above, sweeping his gaze over them with a gloomy expression.</p><p></p><p>Among the elders on the two sides of the hall, an elder stepped out, decisively kneeling down and trembling as he spoke:</p><p></p><p>"Reporting to the Sect Master, Wang Sao was under my management."</p><p></p><p>As the Third Elder of the Tianwu Sect, Qian Xuan was also extremely bitter and annoyed at the moment.</p><p></p><p>That damned Wang Sao, always falling short in success but excelling in failure!</p><p></p><p>He never imagined that in addition to Huang Xuan, Jixiang Town actually had two Earth Vein cultivators!</p><p></p><p>Qian Xuan could tell with his eyes closed that Wang Sao had hidden the information and secretly gone there for his own benefit, trying to maximize his achievements.</p><p></p><p>But he ended up sinking in the gutter, dying outside!</p><p></p><p>Now he has implicated himself, and the Sect Master is going to blame him...</p><p></p><p>This is a burden Qian Xuan really doesn't want to bear!</p><p></p><p>That damned Wang Sao is dead now, if he wasn't, Qian Xuan would guarantee to skin him alive!</p><p></p><p>Damn it!</p><p></p><p>The surrounding elders looked at Qian Xuan, sighing inwardly, they could also see that the Third Elder had been taken advantage of.</p><p></p><p>"Third Elder, how did you manage your subordinates? Two Earth Vein cultivators, and they dared to hide it from us, what a huge audacity!"</p><p></p><p>Bai Jiang stared at Qian Xuan, his gaze unfriendly.</p><p></p><p>Qian Xuan knelt down, saying in a hoarse voice, "Sect Master, please forgive me. It was my poor management, I am willing to accept punishment."</p><p></p><p>Qian Xuan didn't plan to make excuses for himself either. Wang Sao was already dead, and he was indeed the outer sect elder under his management.</p><p></p><p>Although he felt a bit helpless and speechless, this burden was destined to be his to bear.</p><p></p><p>Rather than explaining, it would be better to just admit the mistake straightforwardly, maybe that would make the Sect Master feel a bit better.</p><p></p><p>Sure enough, Bai Jiang's expression eased a little, he sat down on the seat and rubbed his brow, saying, "After all, it's not entirely your fault. As the Sect Master, I know you were also kept in the dark. However, since Wang Sao was under your management, the punishment you receive will not be light. But before that, you and the Second Elder should go to Jixiang Town and bring back those two Earth Vein cultivators."</p><p></p><p>That Jixiang Town had a mysterious strong cultivator, and all the sect elders had returned with serious injuries, but not dead!</p><p></p><p>Only the outer sect elder of his Tianwu Sect had died!</p><p></p><p>Could it be that the mysterious strong cultivator was specifically targeting the Tianwu Sect? And where did he come from?</p><p></p><p>The injured elders from the various sects were all at the early Xuan Wu Realm, including the deceased Wang Sao, who was also at the early Xuan Wu Realm!</p><p></p><p>Then what about the strength of that mysterious strong cultivator?</p><p></p><p>It was said that he was a Book Refiner!</p><p></p><p>Xuan Book Realm middle stage? Late stage? Or even Earth Book Realm??</p><p></p><p>Thinking about this, a sense of gravity and caution emerged in the depths of Bai Jiang's eyes!</p><p></p><p>He sent out the Second Elder and Third Elder to retrieve those two Earth Vein cultivators, but that was actually only secondary!</p><p></p><p>His true purpose was to use the Second Elder and Third Elder to probe the strength of that mysterious strong cultivator!</p><p></p><p>With the strength of the two elders working together, they would be more than enough to deal with a Xuan Book Realm middle stage Book Refiner. </p><p></p><p>Even if the opponent was at the Xuan Book Realm late stage, they could still contend for a while.</p><p></p><p>But if the opponent was at the Earth Book Realm!</p><p></p><p>Then... the two elders might be in mortal danger!</p><p></p><p>In the face of uncertain circumstances, the always cautious Bai Jiang would not rashly take action himself, he was afraid of falling into a trap, after all, he had no information about the opponent.</p><p></p><p>Here is the full English translation of the Chinese excerpt:</p><p></p><p>Information...</p><p></p><p>There is a slim possibility that the mysterious cultivator's cultivation level might be even stronger than that of Elder Bai Jiang. </p><p></p><p>If that were the case, then Elder Bai Jiang would be going to his death. That is something Elder Bai Jiang would never do!</p><p></p><p>As long as the two Elders can test each other's strength within his controllable range, Elder Bai Jiang will immediately use his thunderous techniques to slay the other.</p><p></p><p>In the entire Star Luo Empire, there is only one person who has reached the Dao Book Realm, and that is the Dean of the North Star Academy, Mei Cangwu.</p><p></p><p>But this mysterious strong cultivator is obviously not Mei Cangwu.</p><p></p><p>At the moment, Elder Bai Jiang's brows are furrowed, and he has a slight headache.</p><p></p><p>For some reason, he always feels that the waters of the Star Luo Empire are getting deeper and deeper, and this is not a good thing for him and his Tian Wu Sect!</p><p></p><p>"Sect Master, rest assured!" </p><p></p><p>The Second Elder stepped forward and responded together with Qian Xuan.</p><p></p><p>"Mm." Elder Bai Jiang nodded, then suddenly said in a solemn voice, "If... I'm just saying if, if the situation is not right, you must return to the sect immediately, remember!"</p><p></p><p>The Elders were taken aback, and then inwardly sighed bitterly. </p><p></p><p>The Sect Master is still the same as always, becoming so sensitive and cautious whenever something happens.</p><p></p><p>As the number one powerful sect in the Star Luo Empire, what do they have to be afraid of?</p><p></p><p>The Second Elder and Third Elder, as long as they don't encounter Yin Quan and Mei Cangwu, can simply walk through the Star Luo Empire.</p><p></p><p>However, the Elders only dared to think these thoughts in their hearts.</p><p></p><p>"Yes, Sect Master."</p><p></p><p>After the Second Elder and Third Elder responded, they quickly left the hall.</p><p></p><p>"These past few days, closely monitor the movements of the various sects, as well as that Jixing Town, and be extra attentive. At the slightest disturbance, report to me immediately, understand?"</p><p></p><p>Elder Bai Jiang said indifferently.</p><p></p><p>"Yes." The Elders bowed.</p><p></p><p>Seeing this, Elder Bai Jiang waved his hand and said, "You may leave."</p><p></p><p>"We take our leave."</p><p></p><p>After the Elders had all left one by one,</p><p></p><p>Elder Bai Jiang's eyes flickered, and he expressionlessly activated a mechanism on the chair.</p><p></p><p>The next moment, the chair rotated 180 degrees.</p><p></p><p>Elder Bai Jiang had disappeared. </p><p></p><p>The chair remained the same as before!</p><p></p><p>It turned out that this chair was actually double-sided!</p><p></p><p>The other side led to who knows where...</p><p></p><p>...</p><p></p><p>In the dark underground tunnel, a middle-aged man was meticulously digging deeper with his tools, and despite being alone, his efficiency was countless times more terrifying than a pangolin.</p><p></p><p>Illuminated by the faint glow of the luminescent stones in the tunnel, the middle-aged man's face could be vaguely seen.</p><p></p><p>It was none other than the previously disappeared Elder Bai Jiang!</p><p></p><p>After a moment, Bai Jiang took out the blueprints and carefully examined them, his eyes gleaming with excitement:</p><p></p><p>"The position is almost broken through now, with my speed, it won't take more than three days! Keep going!"</p><p></p><p>After the excitement, Bai Jiang continued to work diligently, and with his strength, he soon disappeared from sight.</p><p></p><p>This secret passage was a lifeline that Bai Jiang had carefully constructed over a long time!</p><p></p><p>Only he in the entire Tian Wu Sect knew about it!</p><p></p><p>Normally, whenever Bai Jiang had free time, he would come here to dig.</p><p></p><p>The recent events in Jixing Town had made Bai Jiang's heart more sensitive again, so he dismissed the Elders and immediately came to dig.</p><p></p><p>In less than three days, it would be completely through, and as for where it led, only Bai Jiang knew.</p><p></p><p>Anyway, this lifeline passage had consumed a lot of Bai Jiang's efforts, and it was not an ordinary passage. It even had the function of concealing its aura, so even if the outside was extremely powerful, it would be difficult for them to sense him in a short time.</p><p></p><p>By the time they reacted, he would have already left the Star Luo Empire quietly.</p><p></p><p>As for such life-saving methods, Bai Jiang had more than just this one. In fact, he had many other life-saving tricks up his sleeve.</p><p></p><p>After all these years of establishing his dominance in the Star Luo Empire, Bai Jiang had seen too many cases of falling into the gutter. </p><p></p><p>Therefore, he had become extremely cautious, vigilant, and always prepared for the worst.</p><p></p><p>Speaking of which, even if Yin Quan and Mei Cangwu wanted to kill Bai Jiang, it would not be an easy task... in fact, it could be said to be very difficult.</p>

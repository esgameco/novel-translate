        <div class="content">
            <p>Here is the full English translation of the Chinese excerpt:</p><p></p><p>The old turtle was startled. .o0√óX√ó0o. 69‡∏£ƒßùï¶x.ùìíœå–º .o0√óX√ó0o.</p><p></p><p>"It's the master after all, directly saying he wants to break through the divine path, quite impressive."</p><p></p><p>Unfortunately, the old turtle didn't have that kind of ability.</p><p></p><p>"The Lingchen Realm has actually produced a character, not easy."</p><p></p><p>Lu Changsheng suddenly smiled and said.</p><p></p><p>The old turtle was puzzled, "Ah?"</p><p></p><p>"It's the one you mentioned before, the one who offended the Immortal Realm, causing the ascension channel to be blocked."</p><p></p><p>The old turtle suddenly understood and asked, "Master's meaning is..."</p><p></p><p>Lu Changsheng nodded slightly and said, "He is now a Chaos Immortal Lord."</p><p></p><p>"Born in the lower realm, breaking through to the Chaos Immortal Lord, is indeed a remarkable person."</p><p></p><p>The old turtle nodded lightly after hearing this.</p><p></p><p>He knew that for a cultivator from the lower realm to break through to the Chaos Immortal Lord was extremely difficult.</p><p></p><p>Out of millions of lower realm cultivators who ascended, it was hard to produce even one Chaos Immortal Lord in hundreds of thousands of years.</p><p></p><p>It just showed how difficult it was.</p><p></p><p>The old turtle suddenly reacted, and asked in a dazed manner, "Master's meaning, could it be that person is not dead?"</p><p></p><p>"Correct, he is still alive, imprisoned in the Grand Inquisition Palace," Lu Changsheng said softly.</p><p></p><p>The old turtle suddenly became curious.</p><p></p><p>Curious about how this person managed to stay alive, and why the Inquisition Palace didn't kill him.</p><p></p><p>"Old Turtle, go and destroy the Inquisition Branch Palace in the southeast direction, I'll go visit the Grand Inquisition Palace in the center of Fuyao Immortal Realm."</p><p></p><p>After saying this, Lu Changsheng disappeared from the turtle shell.</p><p></p><p>"Old Turtle understands."</p><p></p><p>The old turtle transformed into a human form and headed towards the southeast, tearing open the space to enter.</p><p></p><p>He knew Lu Changsheng's intention, that the Inquisition Branch Palace in the southeast direction must be where the inquisitors they encountered in the Langtiandomain came from.</p><p></p><p>Letting him handle it was nothing more than preventing the three immortal clans of the Langtiandomain from being implicated.</p><p></p><p>...</p><p></p><p>In the Soul Realm.</p><p></p><p>By the Reincarnation Lake.</p><p></p><p>The surface of the lake was calm, rippling with a bluish glow.</p><p></p><p>An endless queue of soul bodies, all with vacant, dazed expressions, were walking aimlessly.</p><p></p><p>Walking and walking, the soul bodies had no idea how long they had been walking...</p><p></p><p>This lakeside seemed to have no end.</p><p></p><p>Among them, one soul body was slightly different, its gaze not empty and dull, but alert and vigilant.</p><p></p><p>The old butler was now somewhat panicked. Along the way, after passing through one checkpoint after another, he had already realized that something was wrong with him!</p><p></p><p>The other soul bodies all seemed to have no consciousness, but how come he had such a clear mind! He even felt like he could speak, but he didn't dare make a sound.</p><p></p><p>Could it be that he was the chosen one?</p><p></p><p>The old butler couldn't help but think in his heart.</p><p></p><p>Ding-dong-ding‚Äî</p><p></p><p>At this moment, three consecutive bell sounds rang out.</p><p></p><p>The old butler was startled, looking up to see a huge black vortex appearing ahead.</p><p></p><p>Next to the vortex stood a few soul collectors dressed in black, holding black whips and soul locks, seemingly chatting about something.</p><p></p><p>Soon, the soul bodies one by one entered the black vortex and disappeared, the speed not too fast.</p><p></p><p>The lead soul collector, seeing this, was clearly impatient, shaking his black whip and shouting in a low voice,</p><p></p><p>"Hurry up! You've committed all kinds of evil deeds, entering the beast realm is inevitable! This collector sees who dares to dawdle!"</p><p></p><p>As he spoke, he lashed the whip at a soul body passing by, and that soul body was instantly dispersed, not even having a chance at reincarnation.</p><p></p><p>The other soul bodies, although still expressionless and dazed, sped up their pace, a subconscious reaction.</p><p></p><p>Only the old butler stood there dumbfounded as one soul body after another passed through him.</p><p></p><p>Beast... beast realm?</p><p></p><p>The old butler was dumbfounded!</p><p></p><p>He had never done any bad deeds in his life, how did he end up in the beast realm?</p><p></p><p>This shouldn't be!</p><p></p><p>He suddenly remembered, when he died...</p><p></p><p>Here is the full English translation of the excerpt from the Chinese novel:</p><p></p><p>The previous teacher told him that in the afterlife world, someone would arrange for him, </p><p></p><p>New 69 Book Bar ‚Üí 69shu.com</p><p></p><p>If no one arranges it, then it would be the realm of beasts, right?</p><p></p><p>Hiss!</p><p></p><p>The teacher truly did not deceive me...</p><p></p><p>Although it is the realm of beasts, since it was arranged by the teacher, could it be that the teacher's arrangement of the realm of beasts has some special meaning?</p><p></p><p>For example, the teacher might have let him reincarnate as a tiger or a lion, and then through diligent cultivation, gradually become the King of All Demons?</p><p></p><p>The old butler wildly speculated, and after pondering, his mood was clearly much better.</p><p></p><p>If that were the case, it would not be unacceptable!</p><p></p><p>While the old butler was indulging in flights of fancy, the several soul messengers on the black vortex side quickly noticed him!</p><p></p><p>The several soul messengers were stunned, looking at each other in bewilderment.</p><p></p><p>What was the meaning of this soul body stopping there?</p><p></p><p>This was the first time they had encountered such a situation.</p><p></p><p>And this soul body seemed to still have memories... Strange.</p><p></p><p>They couldn't help but have their gazes turn cold, and they swung their black whips and soul locks as they approached the old butler...</p><p></p><p>The old butler snapped out of his thoughts and saw this, and hurriedly disguised his gaze to be empty and dull, continuing to follow the team towards the black vortex.</p><p></p><p>He couldn't be dispersed by a whip, he still had to become the King of All Demons.</p><p></p><p>"You, stop."</p><p></p><p>The soul messenger called out to the old butler tentatively.</p><p></p><p>The old butler's gaze remained empty, but in his heart, he was scared to death, and his steps also stopped.</p><p></p><p>"Do you still have memories?" the soul messenger probed further, while also swinging the black whip in his hand.</p><p></p><p>The old butler was startled by the swinging of the black whip, and his gaze couldn't help but change!</p><p></p><p>The soul messenger was taken aback, and then smiled: "Good, there is actually a stray fish, I didn't expect such a loophole to appear in front!"</p><p></p><p>Saying that, he raised the black whip in his hand, ready to strike down.</p><p></p><p>For him, directly dispersing it would be fine, a soul body with memories naturally could not be allowed to reincarnate, and as for sending it back to the front to erase the memories again, a small soul body like this was not necessary at all, it would only waste time!</p><p></p><p>"Sir! No, it wasn't intentional!" </p><p></p><p>The old butler was completely panicked, and finally couldn't help but speak up, this was the first time he had spoken in this soul realm.</p><p></p><p>What the old butler didn't know was that, </p><p></p><p>at the moment he opened his mouth, a dormant aura in his body suddenly burst out!</p><p></p><p>At the same time, in the deepest palace of the soul realm,</p><p></p><p>a middle-aged man wearing a black robe, with a body as burly and powerful as a wild beast, suddenly opened his eyes!!</p><p></p><p>He had fiery red hair, a single horn on his forehead, and his ox-like eyes flashed with astonishment and disbelief!</p><p></p><p>"This is..."</p><p></p><p>The next moment, the middle-aged man disappeared from the original spot with a look of suspicion on his face!</p><p></p><p>.........</p><p></p><p>"Sir, please spare me!" </p><p></p><p>The old butler was extremely afraid, kneeling down in front of the soul messenger.  Fearfully looking at the black whip in his hand.</p><p></p><p>If this whip came down, he would be completely done for.</p><p></p><p>"Spare you? With memories not erased, I can't let you reincarnate hehe..."</p><p></p><p>The soul messenger said, raising the black whip in his hand and suddenly lashing it down!</p><p></p><p>The old butler, in his terror, instinctively cried out, "The teacher! The teacher said he knows your boss!"</p><p></p><p>"What teacher?" the soul messenger sneered.</p><p></p><p>Just as the old butler was in despair, the burly middle-aged man appeared, reaching out his large hand to firmly grasp the black whip!</p><p></p><p>The several soul messengers were stunned, and soon their faces were filled with endless trepidation and shock!!</p><p></p><p>They suddenly knelt on the ground, their voices filled with terrifying fear, as if squeezed out from between their teeth,</p><p></p><p>"Soul... Soul Emperor Lord!!"</p><p></p><p>Soulguard threw the black whip to the ground, staring at the dumbfounded old butler with hopeful eyes and asked, "What was the name of the teacher you mentioned?"</p><p></p><p>The old butler's lips trembled, "Lu... Changsheng."</p><p></p><p>Immediately, Soulguard's black robe swayed without wind, and he exclaimed excitedly,</p><p></p><p>"Immortal Emperor Changsheng!!"</p>

        <h1>Chapter 350</h1>
        <div class="content">
            <p>Here is the full English translation of the excerpt from the Chinese novel:</p><p></p><p>Outside the Xianhe Restaurant, the silence was deafening. ‚Ü§‚Ü§‚Ü§‚Ü§‚Ü§ ‚ûÖÔºôùìºÔΩà«óùîµ.Âåö„Ññ–º ‚Ü¶‚Ü¶‚Ü¶‚Ü¶‚Ü¶</p><p></p><p>This atmosphere did not last long, and Han Jinlong finally opened his mouth and smiled:</p><p></p><p>"Lu Xiaoyu, do you have time for a chat today?"</p><p></p><p>Lu, Lu Xiaoyu?</p><p></p><p>The cultivators kneeling on the street felt a sense of difficulty and curiosity in their hearts, but the awe-inspiring presence of the master kept them from daring to lift their heads.</p><p></p><p>But everyone understood that there must be a big shot in the Xianhe Restaurant...</p><p></p><p>Lord Jinlun Wang, he actually came here specially for him today...</p><p></p><p>The owner of the Xianhe Restaurant was already dumbfounded, shivering from head to toe, as if he had fallen into an icy pit. He didn't know there was a big shot in his restaurant?</p><p></p><p>"Come up."</p><p></p><p>When the magnetic young voice sounded in the restaurant, everyone was stunned.</p><p></p><p>"Get up, all of you."</p><p></p><p>And Han Jinlong said a sentence lightly, then disappeared from the front of the Xianhe Restaurant.</p><p></p><p>The countless cultivators on the street did not dare to make a sound, and they stood up rustling, then quickly disappeared from the street.</p><p></p><p>The restaurant owner trembled as he went into the restaurant, not daring to make a sound, just like all the other customers.</p><p></p><p>The customers didn't know whether to leave or stay, and in the end they could only sit back down and drink their wine and eat their food silently, with no one daring to utter a word, only countless private transmissions.</p><p></p><p>On the Xianhe Restaurant side, the news of Jinlun Wang's appearance spread rapidly, causing the street outside the restaurant to be completely empty, with not a single cultivator daring to approach.</p><p></p><p>.........</p><p></p><p>In a room of the restaurant.</p><p></p><p>Lu Changsheng and Han Jinlong sat facing each other.</p><p></p><p>Lu Changsheng looked at the solemn and majestic armored man in front of him and smiled:</p><p></p><p>"Have I had any dealings with Jinlun Wang before?"</p><p></p><p>Han Jinlong's heart jumped, and he shook his head and smiled lightly: "Of course the King has never had any dealings with you, Lu Xiaoyu."</p><p></p><p>Han Jinlong was not too bothered by Lu Xiaoyu directly addressing him as Jinlun Wang, after all, he was a newcomer to the Divine-Demonic Battlefield.</p><p></p><p>However, he did feel a bit different. In this human realm, apart from Sword Sovereign and Yan Jueyi, who would dare to address him so directly?</p><p></p><p>"So why has Jinlun Wang come here today? As one of the Five Overlords of the human race, your true self appearing in this Xianhe Restaurant has certainly given Lu a great honor."</p><p></p><p>Lu Changsheng chuckled lightly.</p><p></p><p>Han Jinlong's eyes flashed with a hint of surprise. </p><p></p><p>Although this was the second time he had seen Lu Xiaoyu, the current situation was completely different from the first time!</p><p></p><p>The first time, Lu Xiaoyu didn't know that the young man in the black robe was him.</p><p></p><p>But now, he himself had appeared in person, and this Lu Xiaoyu was still as calm and indifferent as before...</p><p></p><p>Didn't he see the scene of thousands of people worshiping him outside?</p><p></p><p>His open appearance in the restaurant was not only to give face to Lu Xiaoyu, but also to let him know the weight of Jinlun Wang as one of the Five Overlords of the human race.</p><p></p><p>But it seems... it didn't have much effect.</p><p></p><p>"Lu Xiaoyu, before we discuss why I came here today, I want to ask you one thing - are you not afraid of me?"</p><p></p><p>Han Jinlong looked straight at the young man and asked.</p><p></p><p>"Why should I be afraid of you?" Lu Changsheng asked back.</p><p></p><p>Han Jinlong paused, then smiled and said, "I am one of the Five Overlords of the human race, after all..."</p><p></p><p>As he spoke, he slowly released a trace of his oppressive aura towards Lu Changsheng...</p><p></p><p>Then he was stunned to find that Lu Changsheng didn't have any reaction at all, not even a slight frown.</p><p></p><p>Here is the full English translation of the Chinese excerpt:</p><p></p><p>He didn't even furrow his brow!</p><p></p><p>New 69 Book Bar 99 SHUX.COM</p><p></p><p>Involuntarily, Han Jinlong knitted his brows, gradually increasing the pressure of his aura!</p><p></p><p>At this moment, he believed that even the top three on the battle rankings of the Human City would be suppressed by this aura, but this Lu Xiaoyou still showed no reaction whatsoever!</p><p></p><p>Unknowingly, Han Jinlong withdrew his aura, and his eyes revealed a hint of surprise.</p><p></p><p>This Lu Xiaoyou might be more extraordinary than he had imagined... He had underestimated him before.</p><p></p><p>Lu Changsheng seemed unaware, "What's wrong with the Golden Wheel King?"</p><p></p><p>"Hehe, I hope the young master Lu doesn't mind this little test. I've come today because someone previously recommended you to me, and now that I've met you, you indeed live up to their words," Han Jinlong said with a smile.</p><p></p><p>Lu Changsheng leisurely smiled, "Was it a young man in a black robe named Han?"</p><p></p><p>"Uh... Yes." Han Jinlong nodded slightly, feeling a bit embarrassed.</p><p></p><p>He didn't want to dwell on this topic, so he solemnly said, "Young master Lu, I actually wanted to invite you to participate in the Seven-Colored Crystal Tower, but after that little test, I have some doubts about your cultivation level... Has it reached the Divine Seclusion Realm?"</p><p></p><p>After the aura test just now, he suspected that Lu Xiaoyou's realm might have surpassed the Divine Transcendence Realm...</p><p></p><p>If it had surpassed the Divine Transcendence Realm, then he would not be able to participate in the Seven-Colored Crystal Tower.</p><p></p><p>The Divine Seclusion Realm?</p><p></p><p>Lu Changsheng's eyes flashed briefly, and he shook his head, "I'm not in the Divine Seclusion Realm."</p><p></p><p>Not the Divine Seclusion Realm?</p><p></p><p>Hearing this, Han Jinlong felt relieved, but also a bit disappointed.</p><p></p><p>Compared to this young master Lu being able to participate in the Seven-Colored Crystal Tower, he had hoped that he would be in the Divine Seclusion Realm.</p><p></p><p>If he was in the Divine Seclusion Realm, then he would be the true peak combat power of the Human Tribe.</p><p></p><p>Among the Five Overlords of the Human Tribe, he, the Savage King, the Wind Venerable, the Mace Saint, and the Sword Venerable were all in the late Divine Seclusion Realm, but as for the Sword Venerable, his level was unknown.</p><p></p><p>In the entire Human Tribe, apart from these Five Overlords, there were only three others who had reached the Divine Seclusion Realm, each hidden in the main palaces of the Three Great Cities, directly under the command of the Tribal Lord, but they were all in the early Divine Seclusion Realm.</p><p></p><p>So, in the entire Human Tribal Lands, with a population of billions, there were only eight people in the Divine Seclusion Realm!</p><p></p><p>Han Jinlong was still a bit puzzled. If this young master Lu was not in the Divine Seclusion Realm, then how did he withstand the aura he had just released...</p><p></p><p>"Young master Lu, although you have not yet reached the Divine Seclusion Realm, you must be at the peak of the Divine Transcendence Realm, just a step away from that Divine Seclusion. Don't be discouraged, when you are truly ready to break through, we will help you," Han Jinlong said solemnly.</p><p></p><p>Huh?</p><p></p><p>Lu Changsheng raised his eyebrows, almost smiling.</p><p></p><p>But he also knew that the other party was well-intentioned, so he didn't say anything.</p><p></p><p>He wouldn't just point at Han Jinlong's nose and say, "I'm stronger than you," that's not his style.</p><p></p><p>After all, he had just arrived at the Divine-Demonic Battlefield, and in time, who in the Divine-Demonic Battlefield wouldn't know the name of Lu Changsheng?</p><p></p><p>"Then I thank the Golden Wheel King for his kindness," Lu Changsheng smiled and with a wave of his sleeve, two wine jars appeared on the table, "Since the Golden Wheel King has shown me such courtesy today, then let Lu pay you a drink."</p><p></p><p>The moment the wine jars appeared, Han Jinlong's nose twitched, and his eyes immediately lit up as he swallowed, asking, "What... what kind of wine is this?"</p><p></p><p>Lu Changsheng smiled, "One is the Cleansing Soul Brew, the other is the Dream-Entering Brew."</p>

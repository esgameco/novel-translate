        <h1>Chapter 149</h1>
        <div class="content">
            <p>Here is the full English translation of the Chinese excerpt:</p><p></p><p>The crowd immediately began to size up the two waiters in front of them. üê§üíù‚ùªÔºô≈úÂçÑœÖ–ñ.‚ÑÇ„Ññ–º‚ô§‚ôü</p><p></p><p>Soon, one by one, they furrowed their brows, thinking, "So weak?"</p><p></p><p>Any random person among them could easily crush these two waiters!</p><p></p><p>Looking at this, the owner of this tavern must not be that formidable either...</p><p></p><p>Zuo Qi Ran's gaze only briefly lingered on Tong Xin and Lin Dong, before turning to explore the tavern within the courtyard, as if searching for something.</p><p></p><p>Tong Xin and Lin Dong looked at the crowd in front of them, feeling a little flustered.</p><p></p><p>It was not because of the powerful strength of these people that they were flustered, after all, their backer Lu Changsheng was almighty in their hearts, and they had also seen many strong experts in the Immortal Emperor's Palace in the Central Immortal Realm ten years ago.</p><p></p><p>The two were flustered because the tavern was opening today, and so many people had come, but they wouldn't be able to serve them all.</p><p></p><p>Moreover, there was no array set up in the tavern to expand the internal space, it was just an ordinary space, and it could only accommodate a few dozen people at most!!</p><p></p><p>This is a bit difficult...</p><p></p><p>Tong Xin cleared his throat, put on a smile, and said with a slight bow, "Today is the opening day of our Changsheng Tavern, thank you all for coming to support us."</p><p></p><p>Seeing this, Lin Dong also smiled and bowed slightly.</p><p></p><p>The two were neither fawning nor bootlicking.</p><p></p><p>They were just expressing the basic courtesy of being waiters.</p><p></p><p>After all, they are now the staff of the Changsheng Tavern, and the tavern's boss is their master, so naturally they represent the master's face.</p><p></p><p>"Your tavern has quite a big mouth, actually using 'Changsheng' in the name, do you know this is the Black Abyss Domain?"</p><p></p><p>"Where's your boss? Didn't he see so many guests? Can you two little brats with barely any experience handle this?"</p><p></p><p>"Is your boss afraid and hiding away because he didn't expect this to happen?"</p><p></p><p>"Move aside, we're going in."</p><p></p><p>"......"</p><p></p><p>The crowd spoke one after another, their tones full of sarcasm, disdain, and hostility.</p><p></p><p>Seeing this, Tong Xin and Lin Dong were shocked, finally realizing that the people in front of them were not here to patronize, but with ill intent!</p><p></p><p>And it was all because of the tavern's name, but... Shouldn't it be normal for the master to name the tavern after himself?</p><p></p><p>Tong Xin's gaze slightly narrowed, and he apologetically said, "I'm sorry, distinguished guests, our tavern can only accommodate a few dozen people at most, you all... are too many."</p><p></p><p>In front of them, it was layer upon layer of people, at least thousands of them, how could their tavern possibly accommodate them all!</p><p></p><p>Huh?!</p><p></p><p>The crowd was slightly taken aback, looking at each other.</p><p></p><p>What does this mean?</p><p></p><p>Except for the mortal realm, which tavern nowadays doesn't have a secret realm inside? Setting up an array to expand the internal space shouldn't be that difficult, right?</p><p></p><p>Could it be that the tavern master is really that incompetent?</p><p></p><p>"What do you mean?" someone asked in a deep voice, slowly clenching his fist, his gaze turning fierce.</p><p></p><p>Lin Dong wanted to speak, but Tong Xin slightly shook his head to stop him. His face no longer had the usual playful smile, only solemnity and apology as he said, "So those who can't wait in line will have to leave, for which we sincerely apologize."</p><p></p><p>Hearing this, the crowd was stunned. Wait in line?? </p><p></p><p>Treating this Black Abyss Domain as some kind of place, and treating them as what?</p><p></p><p>The next moment, the crowd's expressions turned grim, and the queue slowly approached the courtyard gate!</p><p></p><p>Seeing this, Tong Xin and Lin Dong's hearts tightened.</p><p></p><p>Tap, tap, tap...</p><p></p><p>Just then, footsteps were heard from within the courtyard.</p><p></p><p>The crowd turned their gaze, their expressions slightly tightening, as a young man in blue robes leisurely walked out and stood behind the two waiters.</p><p></p><p>"Master." </p><p></p><p>Tong Xin and Lin Dong were delighted, quickly turning around and paying their respects.</p><p></p><p>"Mm." Lu Changsheng nodded slightly, speaking softly, "You two..."</p><p></p><p>Here is the full English translation of the Chinese excerpt:</p><p></p><p>"Step back," he said.</p><p></p><p>"Yes."</p><p></p><p>Tongxin and Lin Dong silently retreated.</p><p></p><p>The crowd eyed the man in the blue robe, and the more they looked, the more alarmed they became, for in their perception, the aura of the man in the blue robe was exceptionally tranquil.</p><p></p><p>It was as if he was an ordinary person, without the slightest fluctuation.</p><p></p><p>But therein lay the problem!</p><p></p><p>The crowd became alert.</p><p></p><p>As everyone knew, no ordinary person would dare to come to the Black Abyss Domain...</p><p></p><p>So the man before them was certainly no ordinary person, there were only two possibilities - either he possessed some concealing abilities, or... he was far too powerful, leagues beyond their level!</p><p></p><p>Zuo Qi curiously examined the seemingly amiable man in the blue robe, she had already understood from the earlier reactions of the two waiters that this person was most likely the proprietor of the Longevity Tavern.</p><p></p><p>"Are you the proprietor of the Longevity Tavern?" someone asked in a deep voice.</p><p></p><p>Lu Changsheng turned his head to look at the person, smiling gently, "Indeed, I am the proprietor of this tavern. Is there anything I can help you with?"</p><p></p><p>This response left the person somewhat at a loss. He couldn't understand how the name of the tavern was so bold, yet the proprietor was so gentle. Shouldn't he be more arrogant to match the grandiose name of the establishment?</p><p></p><p>Seeing the person's bewilderment, Lu Changsheng gave a faint smile and swept his gaze across the crowd, saying, "Everyone, the Longevity Tavern is now open for business. Each of you has the opportunity to enjoy a free drink, but only for today. However, before that, you all need to form an orderly queue, one batch at a time."</p><p></p><p>With that, he turned to head back into the tavern.</p><p></p><p>The crowd snapped out of their daze, looking at the retreating blue-robed figure in disbelief. How could this person speak so matter-of-factly and elegantly? Did he think they, the ruthless denizens of the Black Abyss Domain, would be tempted by a free drink?</p><p></p><p>"Let us queue up? Who do you think you are?!" </p><p></p><p>At this moment, a hawk-nosed man stepped forward and continued to shout angrily, "Fellow cultivators, don't be misled. Our purpose here today is not to drink some inferior wine, but to teach him the rules of the Black Abyss Domain!!"</p><p></p><p>"That's right! This person is indeed as arrogant as the inscription on that sign, today we shall level his wretched tavern and teach him a lesson!"</p><p></p><p>"Correct, I can't stand it anymore. Don't be fooled by his amiable attitude, there is underlying contempt in his every word. Let's all take him down!"</p><p></p><p>"......"</p><p></p><p>Clamorous voices erupted from all sides.</p><p></p><p>However, despite the bold words, no one dared to rashly charge forward. After all, this man in the blue robe still possessed an aura that was somewhat unfathomable.</p><p></p><p>Lu Changsheng paused in his steps and turned around, his face expressionless.</p><p></p><p>Tongxin and Lin Dong suddenly shuddered, casting pitying glances at the crowd.</p><p></p><p>At that moment, a blue light flashed in the depths of Lu Changsheng's black eyes.</p><p></p><p>The next instant,</p><p></p><p>Boom! Boom! Boom! Boom! Boom!!!</p><p></p><p>A series of explosive sounds suddenly erupted among the crowd!</p><p></p><p>Those who had spoken out of turn were mysteriously reduced to a bloody mist!</p><p></p><p>The crowd was both trembling and bewildered. When they finally regained their senses, they were all stricken with terror as they looked towards Lu Changsheng.</p><p></p><p>At this moment, an immense, overwhelming pressure descended from the heavens!</p><p></p><p>Rumble!!</p><p></p><p>Under this irresistible pressure, including Zuo Qi, everyone in the crowd paled and fell to their knees in a vast, undulating sea.</p><p></p><p>At this time, all their pupils contracted, their spirits trembling. They had already realized that this man in the blue robe...</p><p></p><p>was the latter of the two possibilities!!</p><p></p><p>Silence reigned, with only the sound of a falling pin. Tongxin and Lin Dong kept their heads bowed, filled with reverence.</p><p></p><p>"Rules?" Lu Changsheng clasped his hands behind his back, sweeping his gaze across the crowd, and spoke calmly,</p><p></p><p>"In this place, my rules are the rules."</p>

        <h1>Chapter 290</h1>
        <div class="content">
            <p>Here is the full English translation of the Chinese excerpt:</p><p></p><p>Li Shuyan looked up and glanced at the purple energy beam with a calm expression. He also took a look at the yellow energy beams of the people beside him, although he did not understand the rules and was not sure what it meant for himself.</p><p></p><p>However, he knew that he had passed and obtained the qualification to attend the Heavenly Emperor's Assembly.</p><p></p><p>Moreover, his purple energy beam looked quite good. Otherwise, so many people around him would not be so agitated, and their words would not be full of worship and envy.</p><p></p><p>He took a deep breath and stepped back.</p><p></p><p>But as soon as he stepped back, countless people swarmed towards him.</p><p></p><p>"Senior, my family's young master is the young master of the Lin Clan in the Royal City. The young master specially asked me to come and ask if you would be willing to be his friend?"</p><p></p><p>"Ah, what a piece of trash Lin Clan young master, senior, my family's young master is Miu Lun of the Miu Clan. He is very willing to be your friend."</p><p></p><p>"......"</p><p></p><p>These people were basically all stationed here by the various clans in the Royal City. Whenever a strange Saint Monarch or even top-tier Saint Yang Realm Heavenly Emperor appeared, they would immediately come to try to win them over!</p><p></p><p>Li Shuyan frowned and glanced at them: "No need, thank you."</p><p></p><p>After saying that, he broke through the crowd and disappeared.</p><p></p><p>Regarding this, the crowd could only feel a little unwilling, but they did not dare to say anything more. A strange top-tier Saint Yang Realm Heavenly Emperor could only be courted, and they absolutely could not offend him.</p><p></p><p>Li Shuyan wandered around the Ancient Wasteland Royal City, trying to find out where Lu Changsheng was, but he had no clue.</p><p></p><p>Helpless, he randomly found an inn and booked a room to stay.</p><p></p><p>At the same time, in the room next to Li Shuyan's.</p><p></p><p>Lu Changsheng was sitting cross-legged on the bed, with a table in front of him. On the table were some fine wines, and he was drinking them one sip after another, not bothering with the arrival of Li Shuyan next door.</p><p></p><p>Liu Tu, Fu Liangcai, and the others were either holed up in their own rooms or wandering around the Royal City, being considerate and not disturbing Lu Changsheng.</p><p></p><p>A few days later,</p><p></p><p>In the Miu Clan of the Royal City.</p><p></p><p>The Miu Clan Chief erupted in thunderous rage, "Summon that rebellious son to me!!"</p><p></p><p>"Yes, yes, yes."</p><p></p><p>Soon, Miu Lun was dragged by a few elders to stand before the Miu Clan Chief, his face now somewhat pale.</p><p></p><p>"Greet your father." Miu Lun immediately knelt down, trembling.</p><p></p><p>The Miu Clan Chief stared at him and said indifferently, "Uncle Fu is dead."</p><p></p><p>Miu Lun's body shook, and although he had already sensed it, when he heard these words from his father's mouth, his body still felt a chill.</p><p></p><p>Miu Lun tried his best to remain calm, his face showing a mix of confusion, shock, and deep sorrow: "Father, what are you saying? Uncle Fu... is dead? What happened?"</p><p></p><p>Slap!!</p><p></p><p>The Miu Clan Chief slapped him hard, roaring, "Rebellious son, at a time like this, you're still pretending? Do you think your father knows nothing? Your servants have already told me everything!"</p><p></p><p>"Tell me, who gave you, this beast, the courage to provoke the Blood Moon?!"</p><p></p><p>He shouted the last part almost hysterically.</p><p></p><p>Miu Lun was stunned. He had never seen his father so furious, his eyes even turning bloodshot, as if he was about to tear his own son apart at any moment.</p><p></p><p>"Father, I'm sorry! I'm sorry, son knows he was wrong!" Miu Lun kowtowed frantically, tears streaming down his face.</p><p></p><p>He was afraid.</p><p></p><p>He was truly afraid that his father, in his rage, would lose all reason and destroy him.</p><p></p><p>"Hmph, Uncle Fu is dead, do you know what that means for our Miu Clan? Huh?" The Miu Clan Chief's face was ice-cold.</p><p></p><p>Miu Lun was completely at a loss, trembling and not knowing what to say.</p><p></p><p>"Uncle Fu, as a mid-Saint Yang Realm expert, your father has always treated him with great courtesy. You, this rebellious son... on what basis, on what basis?!!"</p><p></p><p>"Do you know how great a loss Uncle Fu's death is for our Miu Clan?? You..."</p><p></p><p>Here is the full English translation of the Chinese excerpt:</p><p></p><p>"You trash, ten of you wouldn't even be worth one Fu Bo!" </p><p></p><p>"Furthermore, you dare to provoke the Blood Moon? No one knows her background, if her background is powerful... Do you want our Miu Clan to be wiped out? Bring him in!"</p><p></p><p>The Miu Clan Chief grew increasingly agitated as he spoke.</p><p></p><p>"Yes, sir!"</p><p></p><p>The Miu Clan Chief looked indifferently at the trembling Miu Lun. "Take this rebellious son and subject him to the Extreme Thunder Punishment!"</p><p></p><p>Several elders were shocked.</p><p></p><p>Miu Lun's pupils shrank, and he trembled as he said, "Father, don't, the Heavenly Monarch Assembly is about to begin in a year, if I receive the Extreme Thunder Punishment, it will affect my performance at the Heavenly Monarch Assembly!"</p><p></p><p>The Miu Clan Chief's expression was blank: "This year's Heavenly Monarch Assembly is fiercely competitive, there are countless Heavenly Monarchs, do you really think you can have an outstanding performance at the Heavenly Monarch Assembly? Whether you're there or not, it makes no difference. Take him away!"</p><p></p><p>...</p><p></p><p>Time passed quickly,</p><p></p><p>In the blink of an eye, this final year was about to end, and the Heavenly Monarch Trials had also been completed.</p><p></p><p>The Heavenly Monarch Assembly of this session will officially begin in three days.</p><p></p><p>The total number of participants in this Heavenly Monarch Assembly is 100,000, no more, no less.</p><p></p><p>According to the records of the Measurement Stones:</p><p></p><p>There are 20 top-tier Heavenly Monarchs at the Divine Yang Realm,</p><p>1,000 Heavenly Monarchs at the Divine Origin Realm,</p><p>98,979 Heavenly Monarchs at the Immortal Ancestor Realm,</p><p>And 1 Heavenly Monarch at the Immortal Emperor Realm.</p><p></p><p>As the final day approached, a knocking sound came from outside Lu Changsheng's room.</p><p></p><p>Knock, knock, knock.</p><p></p><p>"Senior Lu, the Heavenly Monarch Assembly will begin tomorrow."</p><p></p><p>Immediately after, Fu Liangcai's respectful voice came from outside the room.</p><p></p><p>Lu Changsheng opened his drowsy eyes and asked, "Where is it being held?"</p><p></p><p>Fu Liangcai respectfully replied, "The first round is in the Sand Secret Realm southwest of the Ancient Wasteland City."</p><p></p><p>"The Sand Secret Realm." Lu Changsheng murmured softly, then smiled and said, "Okay, I understand."</p><p></p><p>"Liangcai takes his leave."</p><p></p><p>...</p><p></p><p>The next day.</p><p></p><p>As the sun rose, the Ancient Wasteland City suddenly became lively!</p><p></p><p>Countless figures rushed towards the southwest of the city! Some were scattered cultivators, and some were forces bringing their own Heavenly Monarchs!</p><p></p><p>The first round, the Sand Secret Realm, was in that area!</p><p></p><p>...</p><p></p><p>Li Shuyan stretched and walked out the door, then froze.</p><p></p><p>"Huh?"</p><p></p><p>The waiting Fu Liangcai and the others first looked at Li Shuyan with puzzlement, pausing on his bald head for a moment, then remembered!</p><p></p><p>Isn't this Senior Lu's attendant? He's actually here?</p><p></p><p>Well, after some time, his head has gone bald!</p><p></p><p>Liu Tu looked at Li Shuyan with a solemn expression, sensing a deadly threat from him!!</p><p></p><p>"Oh, what a coincidence, you're also staying here?"</p><p></p><p>Li Shuyan smiled as he touched his head.</p><p></p><p>He hadn't realized the implications yet.</p><p></p><p>Creakâ€”</p><p></p><p>At this moment,</p><p>Lu Changsheng leisurely walked out of the room.</p><p></p><p>Li Shuyan was dumbfounded, truly not expecting his master to be staying next door?</p><p></p><p>He quickly knelt down, exclaiming joyfully, "Master!!"</p><p></p><p>The eyes behind Lu Changsheng's bronze mask looked at him indifferently and said, "You've become stronger, but also balder."</p><p></p><p>Li Shuyan smiled embarrassedly. To him, the person in front of him was like a teacher.</p><p></p><p>"Get up, follow me to the Sand Secret Realm, and strive for a good ranking in the Heavenly Monarch Assembly, otherwise you'll be unworthy of the Myriad Flames Incantation."</p><p></p><p>Lu Changsheng said softly.</p><p></p><p>Listening to the conversation, Fu Liangcai and the others were already dumbfounded, feeling that the rankings in the Heavenly Monarch Assembly were just like child's play to the two of them...</p><p></p><p>"Yes, Master!" Li Shuyan immediately agreed, then scratched his head, puzzled, "But what about you, Master?"</p><p></p><p>Lu Changsheng smiled leisurely: "I naturally don't pursue a very good ranking, as long as I can... become a Sword Servant, that's enough hehe."</p>

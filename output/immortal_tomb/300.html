        <div class="content">
            <p>Here is the full English translation of the Chinese excerpt:</p><p></p><p>Zhou Yuan nodded repeatedly,</p><p></p><p>"That's right, Father, that bald-headed one is a body cultivator, his actual strength is far beyond what can be matched by early-stage Celestial Sun Realm cultivators!"</p><p></p><p>As an early-stage Celestial Sun Realm prodigy of a great clan, his cultivation was actually much stronger than ordinary early-stage Celestial Sun Realm cultivators, but he was still no match for that bald-headed one. üíéüòÇ‚ûÖ‚ûà‡∏£ùêáùï¶ùîÅ.ùïîùì∏–ºüò°üòù</p><p></p><p>Zhou Yuan recalled the scene in the secret realm where countless sand blades struck the bald-headed one but had no effect, and his heart still trembled at the memory.</p><p></p><p>Zhou Zhenjiang's brows furrowed slightly as he pondered deeply, unable to imagine which top-tier force in the Ancient Desolate Ruins specialized in body cultivation.</p><p></p><p>If it was about body cultivation, there were some, </p><p></p><p>but they were not in the Ancient Desolate Ruins, and they were the Eight Ancient Clans!!</p><p></p><p>The Ancient Saint Realm's Ancient Saint Clan, rumored to have all its members as body cultivators!</p><p></p><p>Thinking about the Eight Ancient Clans, Zhou Zhenjiang's heart started to race, filled with trepidation.</p><p></p><p>After all, the Eight Ancient Clans represented the pinnacle and invincibility in the entire Eternal Celestial Domain.</p><p></p><p>Could it be that the bald-headed one was from the Ancient Saint Clan?</p><p></p><p>Impossible!</p><p></p><p>Zhou Zhenjiang immediately dismissed the idea.</p><p></p><p>Not only was the Ancient Saint Realm extremely far from the Ancient Desolate Ruins, but why would a member of the Ancient Saint Clan come to participate in the Prodigy Assembly of the Ancient Desolate Ruins?</p><p></p><p>Even if there were power struggles among the Eight Ancient Clans, it should be the conflict between the Ancient Moon Blood Clan and the Ancient Desolate Sword Clan in the neighboring Yue Star Realm...</p><p></p><p>The Ancient Saint Realm was just too far away.</p><p></p><p>Moreover, that bald-headed one looked rather simple-minded, not at all like someone from the Eight Ancient Clans.</p><p></p><p>"Yuaner, you said that the body cultivator didn't use any spiritual power at all?" Zhou Zhenjiang asked.</p><p></p><p>Zhou Yuan recalled the scene and solemnly nodded.</p><p></p><p>Zhou Zhenjiang swallowed hard, and with a meaningful smile, said, "It seems that the body cultivation technique of that cultivator is not simple..."</p><p></p><p>Zhou Yuan was startled, "Father, are you thinking of..."</p><p></p><p>"Hehe, after the tea conference is over, we'll go find that body cultivator. Then the Nine Supremes will have no reason to stop us."</p><p></p><p>A glint of greed flashed in Zhou Zhenjiang's eyes as he coldly smiled.</p><p></p><p>.........</p><p></p><p>In the Ancient Desolate Royal City, in a tavern.</p><p></p><p>In the room, Blood Demon Moon stood by the slightly open window, her eyes blankly gazing at the bustling crowd below.</p><p></p><p>She had lost a part of her memory.</p><p></p><p>She knew she was from the Ancient Moon Blood Clan, one of the Eight Ancient Clans, and that she was the noble Ancient Moon Saint Maiden who had come to the Ancient Desolate Ruins to participate in the Prodigy Assembly.</p><p></p><p>But now, after arriving, it seemed she could no longer go back.</p><p></p><p>Why did she say that?</p><p></p><p>Because in her memory, the route back to the Ancient Moon Blood Clan was missing...</p><p></p><p>She was homeless.</p><p></p><p>She missed her master so much...</p><p></p><p>It can be said that at this moment, apart from having her memories of the clan's route stolen by a soul-searching technique, Blood Demon Moon was otherwise normal.</p><p></p><p>She was also clearly aware of what had happened to her in the Sand Secret Realm.</p><p></p><p>But the most bizarre thing was that Blood Demon Moon not only did not hate or resist Lu Changsheng, who had taken control of her, but she actually enjoyed it, was willing to listen to him, and was willing to devote everything to him.</p><p></p><p>Even if Lu Changsheng asked her to die immediately, Blood Demon Moon would unhesitatingly do so, even with a smile on her face.</p><p></p><p>This was the terrifying power of Lu Changsheng's Dao Eyes!</p><p></p><p>The Dao Eyes possessed the ability to kill, defend, see life and death, and break through illusions, as well as various other terrifying techniques.</p><p></p><p>Compared to the Eternal Immortal Body, the Dao Eyes were equally monstrous.</p><p></p><p>At the same time,</p><p></p><p>in another tavern, Lu Changsheng was lazily lying on the bed, his hands behind his head, quietly gazing at the ceiling.</p><p></p><p>His pupils were flickering with a strange blue light.</p><p></p><p>As for these Dao Eyes, Lu Changsheng actually didn't know much about them either, only knowing that they had developed their own consciousness at some point.</p><p></p><p>Just like the Eternal Immortal Body.</p><p></p><p>Here is the full English translation of the Chinese excerpt:</p><p></p><p>"Speaking of which, this name was just something he randomly came up with. At the time, he felt that the two words 'Great Dao' sounded quite good, so he just used it.</p><p></p><p>As for the Bloody Demon Moon, he could control as much as he wanted, but he rarely used such methods in the past.</p><p></p><p>"After dealing with the eight major ancient clans this time, I should go and search for the past......" </p><p></p><p>Lu Changsheng murmured absentmindedly, the blue light in his eyes dissipating in an instant, and he slowly closed his eyes.</p><p></p><p>.........</p><p></p><p>Five days later.</p><p></p><p>Duan Jiu Xiong's voice resounded throughout the Ancient Wasteland Royal City:</p><p></p><p>"The venue for the Tea Talk Conference is the City Lord's Mansion! The 1,500 supreme talents who have qualified must come immediately!"</p><p></p><p>Uproar! </p><p></p><p>The Ancient Wasteland Royal City was instantly filled with a clamor of voices!</p><p></p><p>"Open the betting, open the betting!! I bet that the champion of this supreme talent conference will be Evil Extermination!"</p><p></p><p>"Although Evil Extermination is strong, I feel that Nangong Wenzin is not weak at all. I bet on Nangong Wenzin!"</p><p></p><p>"What, do you really think the hot rankings of the supreme talents are the final rankings?? I bet on the Invisible Killing Tower's Invisible Junior Lord!"</p><p></p><p>"Luo Qingcai is the strongest!"</p><p></p><p>"Tch, our Blood Immortal Goddess is the strongest, she must be the champion of this supreme talent conference!! Ah ah ah ah, look, there's the Blood Immortal Goddess, Blood Immortal Goddess, we love you!"</p><p></p><p>"In the red robe, the Blood Moon is truly my goddess."</p><p></p><p>Swoosh swoosh swoosh!! </p><p></p><p>Countless sonic booms rang out as Evil Extermination and many other supreme talents rushed towards the City Lord's Mansion, attracting the attention of all.</p><p></p><p>Those supreme talents who did not qualify for the Tea Talk Conference could only sigh deeply towards the heavens.</p><p></p><p>No matter how one looked at it, among these 1,500 people, even those at the Immortal Ancestor realm were extraordinary Immortal Ancestors.</p><p></p><p>After this supreme talent conference ends, their names will surely be renowned throughout the Ancient Wasteland Ruins.</p><p></p><p>They, on the other hand, had lost in the Sand Secret Realm, and would have to wait another 20 years for the next supreme talent conference.</p><p></p><p>.........</p><p></p><p>The Tea Talk Conference was held in the plaza of the City Lord's Mansion.</p><p></p><p>This plaza was no longer accessible to just anyone, with only tens of thousands of people present.</p><p></p><p>Compared to that day in the Sand Secret Realm, it was pathetically few.</p><p></p><p>At the very front of the plaza were the leaders of the major factions. Today's supreme talent Tea Talk Conference could be considered the final competition, so they had all come.</p><p></p><p>The Blood Demon Sect Master, the Nangong Clan Elder, the Invisible Killing Tower Master, the Luo Clan Elder, and other peak figures of the Ancient Wasteland Ruins, were all seated.</p><p></p><p>The Miu Clan, the Zhou Clan, and other major clans were also seated in the front.</p><p></p><p>Although they were the major clans of the royal city, they were still a step behind the peak factions like the Blood Demon Sect.</p><p></p><p>At this moment, the leaders of the major factions such as the Blood Demon Sect Master quietly observed the front, and no one was exchanging words. Whether they were communicating privately through voice transmission was unknown.</p><p></p><p>Miu Hangtian looked at the calm, seated figure in blue in the Tea Talk Conference, and bitterly smiled in his heart.</p><p></p><p>Among those present, aside from him, the elders of his family, and a few others, perhaps no one would have thought that this person was the true overlord.</p><p></p><p>......</p><p></p><p>The Tea Talk Conference was set up in an exceptionally elegant manner, with fragrant sandalwood incense and melodious immortal music. The 1,500 supreme talents had already taken their seats.</p><p></p><p>Some were sitting quietly, some were drinking the tea on the table, and some were eating the fruits. The atmosphere was a bit strange, with no one speaking.</p><p></p><p>Those who were more at ease were basically at the Divine Yang Realm and Divine Origin Realm.</p><p></p><p>As for the Immortal Ancestor Realm supreme talents, they were sitting a bit stiffly, as there were too many top-tier supreme talents present, not to mention the countless gazes of the big shots on the plaza being directed at them.</p><p></p><p>They came to this Tea Talk Conference without any real purpose, just to go through the motions and see the excitement.</p><p></p><p>At the moment, most of the gazes were focused on Blood Demon Moon and Lu Changsheng.</p><p></p><p>The former was beautiful and mysterious, and everyone wanted to get close to her.</p><p></p><p>The latter was also mysterious, with his 'Immortal Emperor Realm' cultivation, having forcibly squeezed his way into the Tea Talk Conference.</p><p></p><p>"Hehe, welcome, everyone, to my City Lord's Mansion," a muffled laughter sounded, and Duan Jiu Xiong appeared.</p>

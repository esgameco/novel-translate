        <h1>Chapter 153</h1>
        <div class="content">
            <p>Here is the full English translation of the Chinese excerpt:</p><p></p><p>Time flowed by, second by second, and the night sky finally began to turn a pale white. ‚ô¨üí¢Ôºñ‚ûà≈û‚ìó‡∏¢À£.Âåöùì∏ùïÑüíò‚ôß</p><p></p><p>The crack that pierced the heavens also gradually became clearer.</p><p></p><p>Outside the Longevity Tavern, the people sitting cross-legged in line on the ground perked up, the sky was finally going to brighten!</p><p></p><p>Some of the people at the front of the line looked back at the queue, and couldn't help but take a sharp intake of breath!</p><p></p><p>They saw a dense mass of heads swaying, it seemed to be over ten thousand people......</p><p></p><p>The line even appeared to still be growing......</p><p></p><p>With this sea of people, the Longevity Tavern would not be able to accommodate them all in a short time.</p><p></p><p>However, they all knew that as long as they held their place in line, they would eventually get their turn.</p><p></p><p>Just then, the massive queue suddenly became restless.</p><p></p><p>The cultivators at the very front were puzzled, and turned around to look, their pupils then suddenly constricting.</p><p></p><p>In their line of sight, twelve figures were slowly approaching them.</p><p></p><p>What shocked them was that the four leading figures were the leaders of the four top powers in Qingxuan Town.</p><p></p><p>The Heavenly Snake Manor, Su Qianghe.  </p><p>The Giant Axe Gang, Su Qianghe.</p><p>The Shadowy Pavilion, Zhao Wuou.</p><p>The Controlling Puppet Dao, Yin Jiukui.</p><p></p><p>"No way... the leaders of the four top powers have all come, it seems they're here for the Longevity Tavern, are they going to fight it out?" </p><p>"What about the soul-cleansing wine I've been longing for..."</p><p></p><p>"Well, what can we do? If you don't want to die, just quietly slip away. We've been waiting all night for this, how unlucky."</p><p></p><p>"Don't worry, after yesterday, you should all understand that the Tavern Keeper is likely at the Xian Lord level. Since they dare to open this tavern, it means they are confident. I don't think the four top powers will be able to easily take over the Longevity Tavern."</p><p></p><p>"Xian Lord or not, these four top power leaders are all Xian Lord bigshots. Forget it, if the Longevity Tavern is gone, I'll risk my life to snatch a bottle of the soul-cleansing wine!"</p><p></p><p>"......"</p><p></p><p>The cultivators frantically transmitted messages, their words mostly filled with tension.</p><p></p><p>Normally, they would be quite happy to witness something like this - the four top power leaders making a move. It's not their business after all.</p><p></p><p>But when it came to the soul-cleansing wine they had been longing for, it was a different story.</p><p></p><p>They couldn't help but feel that the four top powers were ruining their good thing!!</p><p></p><p>At the same time,</p><p></p><p>Peng Fang in the queue lowered his eyelids, a hint of murderous intent rising in his heart.</p><p></p><p>If these power leaders targeted the Longevity Tavern today, he would definitely intervene!</p><p></p><p>His gaze was extremely far-sighted, if this tavern was gone, where would he get his soul-cleansing wine in the future?</p><p></p><p>That was unacceptable!</p><p></p><p>Without the soul-cleansing wine, he wouldn't be able to survive at all!</p><p></p><p>A mere Sixth-Rank Xian Lord, against three Fifth-Rank Xian Lords, heh...</p><p></p><p>Peng Fang sneered inwardly...</p><p></p><p>......</p><p></p><p>"Haha, the queue is indeed very long, is this soul-cleansing wine really that good to drink?" </p><p></p><p>The Giant Axe Gang leader Su Qianghe laughed heartily, his muscular body dark and chiseled, exuding a powerful aura.</p><p></p><p>Yin Jiukui's eyes flickered as he smiled, "What good wine haven't we tried? We're not here to drink today, this Longevity Tavern wants to do business in Qingxuan Town, but they'll have to go through us first... Why don't we just directly crush their tavern? What do you think, Lord Su and Lord Zhao?"</p><p></p><p>He looked towards Su Qianghe and Zhao Wuou.</p><p></p><p>Zhao Wuou's face was covered by a mask, his expression and appearance indiscernible, only a hoarse voice emerging, "There's no need to fight over every little thing, right Lord Su?"</p><p></p><p>Here is the full English translation of the Chinese excerpt:</p><p></p><p>[New 629 Book Bar]</p><p></p><p>A strange light flashed in the depths of Left Chou Shan's eyes, and he realized that he was not the only one with the intention to recruit. </p><p></p><p>Su Qiang He and Yin Jiu Chuai did not yet understand, but this Zhao Wu You definitely had the same idea.</p><p></p><p>"Haha, of course, we are all cultivated people, so we naturally won't resort to violence at the slightest disagreement," Left Chou Shan immediately laughed.</p><p></p><p>Su Qiang He immediately laughed and gave a thumbs up, saying, "Lord Left, it has to be you! Being in the Black Sha Domain and still claiming to be cultivated, you must be the first one!"</p><p></p><p>"Haha." Left Chou Shan's laughter was forced.</p><p></p><p>Yin Jiu Chuai fell silent and didn't say anything else. They were all seasoned veterans, so he had already roughly grasped Left Chou Shan and Zhao Wu You's intentions with that little probe just now.</p><p></p><p>He glanced out of the corner of his eye at the cheerfully laughing Su Qiang He, knowing that Su Qiang He might also have the same idea...</p><p></p><p>As mighty Immortal Sovereigns and power leaders, they were definitely not the kind of brainless fools.</p><p></p><p>It seems that they did not come here to cause trouble for the Longevity Wine Inn, but rather, it was a battle for possession between the four top powers!</p><p></p><p>A battle to seize control of the inn's manager!</p><p></p><p>The situation became clear in an instant.</p><p></p><p>As they were speaking, Left Chou Shan and the others had already arrived at the front of the queue. They didn't say anything, nor did they drive anyone away.</p><p></p><p>And the cultivators standing at the very front of the queue obediently stepped back, making way for Left Chou Shan and the others...</p><p></p><p>It was all so natural.</p><p></p><p>If one wants to survive in Qing Xuan Town, they must lower themselves before the leaders of the four top powers.</p><p></p><p>In other words, if you don't want to die.</p><p></p><p>Seeing this, Left Chou Shan and the others expressionlessly stepped forward.</p><p></p><p>The area they occupied seemed to form a vacuum, with the cultivators behind them keeping a distance, not daring to get too close.</p><p></p><p>Although it was completely silent at the moment, the density of the sound transmission in the air was terrifyingly high.</p><p></p><p>As time passed, the sky grew brighter, and the rift in the heavens was as conspicuous as an inverted abyss.</p><p></p><p>It was undeniable that Left Chou Shan and the others were starting to get impatient. If they didn't have the intention to recruit, they wouldn't have waited like this.</p><p></p><p>Creak!</p><p></p><p>At this moment, the inn's door opened.</p><p></p><p>The long queue suddenly became restless, and the sound of countless people swallowing saliva echoed one after another...</p><p></p><p>Heavens, the door has finally opened!</p><p></p><p>Even though it was just like any other night, it felt as if they had waited for over a hundred years!</p><p></p><p>Tong Xin and Lin Dong looked at the scale of the crowd, their expressions changing drastically. Goodness, there were even more people than yesterday...</p><p></p><p>How could there be so many people coming to drink so early in the morning? They must all be lunatics.</p><p></p><p>But remembering the rules set by the Master, they breathed a sigh of relief.</p><p></p><p>Fortunately, they almost forgot that the Master had said the inn would only sell a limited amount of wine every day after officially opening.</p><p></p><p>Tong Xin immediately greeted the group of Left Chou Shan and the others at the very front, "Esteemed guests, you have waited a long time. Please come in, our inn is not very big, and we can only accommodate twenty people at a time."</p><p></p><p>However, Left Chou Shan and the others slightly narrowed their eyes as they looked at Tong Xin and Lin Dong. In their observation, these two junior attendants had exceptional talent!</p><p></p><p>Their talent was even better than the geniuses of their own powers!</p><p></p><p>Such talent, yet they were just junior attendants?</p><p></p><p>Tong Xin and Lin Dong felt a bit uncomfortable under their gaze, and they couldn't help but touch their faces, wondering if they had become more handsome after drinking the mysterious soup the Master had given them last night.</p><p></p><p>"Esteemed guests? Please come in!" Tong Xin waved his hand again, inviting them in.</p>

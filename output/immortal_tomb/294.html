        <h1>Chapter 294</h1>
        <div class="content">
            <p>Here is the full English translation of the Chinese excerpt:</p><p></p><p>Beyond the secret realm of the sands. üçß‚ò†‚ûÖÔºô‚ìàÔº®«óÔº∏.ƒå‚ìû‚ìúüêä‚ô•</p><p></p><p>One after another, the celestial champions were teleported out, either with bruised faces and swollen bodies or covered in blood.</p><p></p><p>The teleportation seemed to never cease.</p><p></p><p>From this, everyone could imagine how intense the battles must have been within the secret realm of the sands!</p><p></p><p>Fortunately, all those who had been teleported out so far were celestial champions at the Immortal Ancestor Realm.</p><p></p><p>So far, no celestial champions above the Divine Origin Realm had been teleported out.</p><p></p><p>As long as the celestial champions of the Divine Origin Realm did not unluckily encounter the top 20 elite champions, they would basically not encounter any accidents.</p><p></p><p>At the same time, the eyes of the Clan Elder of the Miu Clan, who had been quietly waiting in the crowd, suddenly opened!</p><p></p><p>He quickly flipped his palm, and a glass ball appeared in his palm. He looked closely, and the brilliant light that had always been shining in the glass ball had gone out!</p><p></p><p>This was the Life Jade!</p><p></p><p>It was the one he had specially made for his son, Miu Lun, and carried with him.</p><p></p><p>The extinguishing of the light... meant that Miu Lun had...</p><p></p><p>Miu Hantian's eyes instantly turned bloodshot!! Lun'er!</p><p></p><p>Amidst countless bewildered gazes, he abruptly surged out from the crowd and stood before Duan Jiuniong.</p><p></p><p>"Clan Elder!"</p><p></p><p>The Miu Clan's elders were stunned and hurriedly followed after him.</p><p></p><p>At this moment, the surrounding people were discussing in an uproar:</p><p></p><p>"Ah, it's the Clan Elder of the Miu Clan, Miu Hantian! What's he doing...?"</p><p></p><p>"I don't know, but the Clan Elder's state seems a bit off..."</p><p></p><p>"What happened? Could it be that something unexpected happened to the Clan Elder's son inside?"</p><p></p><p>Duan Jiuniong's brows furrowed slightly. He naturally recognized Miu Hantian, as the Miu Clan held some weight in the Royal City. He asked in confusion, "Clan Elder, what's the matter?"</p><p></p><p>Miu Hantian slightly bowed, then opened his palm to reveal the lifeless Life Jade.</p><p></p><p>"Life Jade?" Duan Jiuniong was a remarkable figure, so he naturally recognized the Life Jade, but his gaze became even more puzzled. He couldn't quite comprehend what Miu Hantian meant.</p><p></p><p>At this time, the Miu Clan's elders who had gathered around Miu Hantian had changed drastically in expression.</p><p></p><p>Their young master had died?</p><p></p><p>A murderous aura emerged on Miu Hantian's face as he said in a deep voice, "City Lord Duan, this is the Life Jade of my son..."</p><p></p><p>Duan Jiuniong paused, asking in bewilderment, "Your son entered this secret realm of the sands?"</p><p></p><p>Miu Hantian closed his eyes and nodded.</p><p></p><p>Duan Jiuniong pursed his lips and said, "Clan Elder, please accept my condolences."</p><p></p><p>The surrounding people and many celestial champions were shocked. Miu Lun, a Divine Origin Realm champion, had died???</p><p></p><p>Miu Hantian gritted his teeth and transmitted a message, "City Lord Duan, please do me the favor of opening the secret realm of the sands so that I may quietly enter!"</p><p></p><p>Duan Jiuniong was slightly taken aback, and transmitted a low voice, "Clan Elder, I understand your current state of mind, but please be rational. Your actions would be breaking the rules of the Celestial Champion Assembly!"</p><p></p><p>Miu Hantian paused, speaking in an extremely low tone, "City Lord Duan, Miu Lun was my only son. How can you ask me to be rational?"</p><p></p><p>Duan Jiuniong's expression darkened, and his tone also became less pleasant, "Clan Elder, the Celestial Champion Assembly is not hosted by this City Lord. If you break the rules and are discovered and blamed by the Ancient Desolate Sword Clan, will your Miu Clan be the one to bear the consequences? If you say your Miu Clan will bear it, then I can immediately let you in!"</p><p></p><p>Upon hearing the words "Ancient Desolate Sword Clan", Miu Hantian suddenly calmed down, and beads of cold sweat even appeared on his forehead.</p><p></p><p>He apologetically said, "City Lord Duan, I'm sorry. I was a bit hasty in losing my beloved son."</p><p></p><p>Duan Jiuniong glanced at him and waved his hand, saying, "It's fine, as long as you understand the importance. By the way, Clan Elder, there's something I'm not sure if I should say or not."</p><p></p><p>"City Lord, please speak without reservation," Miu Hantian said sadly.</p><p></p><p>"This City Lord does have some impression of your Miu Clan's Miu Lun. He was also a top existence in the Divine Origin Realm."</p><p></p><p>Here is the full English translation of the Chinese excerpt:</p><p></p><p>"Not bad, my son has reached the Nine Transformations Spirit Origin realm, he's only one step away from the Divine Yang Realm. If he hadn't been so playful all this time, he might have already reached the Divine Yang Realm... Haha, now that he's dead, talking about this is useless..." Miao Hantian said in a dazed and dejected manner.</p><p></p><p>"Clan Leader Miao, the City Lord sees that you have truly become slow-witted due to the pain of losing your beloved son. As a cultivator in the Nine Transformations Spirit Origin realm, in the Sands Secret Realm, aside from the twenty Divine Yang Realm geniuses, who else could have killed him?" Duan Jiuniong said meaningfully.</p><p></p><p>Miao Hantian's heart trembled, but he still stubbornly said, "Thank you, City Lord Duan, for the reminder. But Miao will make whoever killed my son pay a price, the Miao Clan is not to be trifled with!"</p><p></p><p>Duan Jiuniong suddenly didn't want to speak anymore.</p><p></p><p>This Miao Hantian is simply single-minded!</p><p></p><p>Your own son was killed in the secret realm, and you still want to find someone to blame?? </p><p></p><p>Entering the secret realm is a matter of life and death, you can't blame others.</p><p></p><p>"City Lord Duan, I'll take my leave first." </p><p></p><p>Miao Hantian slightly bowed and left with a group of elders, heading towards the royal city in the bewildered gazes of the crowd!</p><p></p><p>...</p><p></p><p>"Clan Leader, the young master, he..." </p><p></p><p>Behind Miao Hantian, an elder said sorrowfully and hesitantly.</p><p></p><p>Miao Hantian abruptly stopped, his face twisted as he growled, "Lun'er naturally won't have died in vain!!!"</p><p></p><p>"You all follow the clan leader back to the clan, together we'll activate the Mysterious Heaven Stone, we must find the culprit! He was my only son, no matter who the culprit is, even if he has a powerful background, he must pay the price!"</p><p></p><p>"Clan Leader, what if the culprit is the Holy Son of the Blood Demon Sect, the Young Master of the Nangong Clan, the Young Hall Master of the Shadow Killing Tower, or the Young Master of the Hei Clan?"</p><p></p><p>Miao Hantian's expression changed slightly, his voice a bit calmer: "Even then, we must demand an explanation. The Miao Clan is not a soft persimmon."</p><p></p><p>The elders fell silent, they all knew the clan leader was just venting.</p><p></p><p>If the culprit really was one of those top-tier geniuses, this mute fool can only swallow the bitter pill.</p><p></p><p>After all, in the secret realm, life and death are fated.</p><p>Those top-tier geniuses have powerful forces behind them, they won't give the Miao Clan much face.</p><p></p><p>...</p><p></p><p>In the Sands Secret Realm.</p><p></p><p>At the oasis where Lu Changsheng's group was.</p><p></p><p>Fu Shiyu and the others were shivering, because after Miao Lun, anyone who came to cause trouble was lightly and effortlessly eliminated by Senior Blue Robe.</p><p></p><p>No, they didn't even see how Lu Changsheng acted, they only knew that the invading geniuses exploded into a mist of blood before they even got close.</p><p></p><p>As long as someone dared to come, Senior Blue Robe seemed to have no intention of sparing them at all.</p><p></p><p>Just then.</p><p></p><p>A red-robed, masked woman suddenly appeared before Fu Shiyu and the others.</p><p></p><p>Fu Shiyu and the three were startled, abruptly standing up from the ground!</p><p></p><p>Divine Yang Realm genius, Blood Moon!!</p><p></p><p>They had already sensed through that special perception that there was a genius lingering around them, as if observing, but they never expected it to be Blood Moon!!</p><p></p><p>"You three, don't panic, I'm not here to cause trouble." </p><p></p><p>Blood Moon's eerie eyes blinked, then fell on the quietly seated Lu Changsheng.</p><p></p><p>Her gaze seemed to want to penetrate through the bronze mask.</p><p></p><p>Everything that had happened before, she had seen it all clearly.</p><p></p><p>This so-called 'Immortal Emperor Realm' genius, it seems he is indeed not a simple person!!</p><p></p><p>At this moment, Lu Changsheng gently opened his eyes, looking directly at her, and said indifferently:</p><p></p><p>"Why have you been staring at me?"</p>

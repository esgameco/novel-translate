        <h1>Chapter 540</h1>
        <div class="content">
            <p>Here is the full English translation of the Chinese excerpt:</p><p></p><p>"Ah, Mr. Lu, this..."</p><p></p><p>The doctor standing by the bedside hurriedly got up and greeted him when he saw Lu Changsheng.</p><p></p><p>The doctor quickly looked at the two jars of wine, hesitating to speak. </p><p></p><p>He wanted to say that this was not appropriate, that who brings wine when visiting a sick person, but he didn't dare to say more, afraid of offending Lu Changsheng.</p><p></p><p>After all, everyone knew that this teacher from the Changsheng Academy was a mysterious figure - not only did the Magistrate and his men treat him with great respect, even the Tianwu Sect's steward revered and treated him well!</p><p></p><p>Lu Changsheng nodded lightly and asked, "How is Old Xu?"</p><p></p><p>Hearing this, the doctor let out a long sigh, his face full of worry.</p><p></p><p>It was because he couldn't figure out what was wrong with Old Xu.</p><p></p><p>His pulse was all over the place, and he didn't know what to do.</p><p></p><p>At this time, Old Xu was lying on the bed, his brow furrowed, drenched in sweat, his mouth trembling as if muttering something.</p><p></p><p>"Mr. Lu, I'm not sure what's wrong with Old Xu, but I suspect he may have suffered some kind of trauma," the doctor said with a frown.</p><p></p><p>Lu Changsheng nodded, "Let me take a look."</p><p></p><p>The doctor was taken aback, and the others were also stunned, not understanding.</p><p></p><p>What? </p><p></p><p>Aren't you just a teacher? Can you also treat the sick?</p><p></p><p>Lu Changsheng raised his eyebrows slightly and smiled, "What? Just because I'm a teacher, does that mean I can only be a teacher?"</p><p></p><p>The doctor's eyes widened, his heart shocked, and he quickly moved aside.</p><p></p><p>Lu Changsheng walked to the bedside, without a word, he picked up a jar of wine and uncorked it.</p><p></p><p>Everyone was stunned, drinking wine at a time like this?</p><p></p><p>The doctor also furrowed his brow, sighing inwardly, "Ah, Mr. Lu's actions are quite inappropriate, opening the cork, the smell of the wine will stimulate the patient's sense of smell."</p><p></p><p>But Lu Changsheng's next move left everyone gaping in astonishment!</p><p></p><p>He simply took the wine jar and inserted the mouth of the jar into Old Xu's mouth, pouring it in forcefully.</p><p></p><p>A simple, rough action.</p><p></p><p>"Mr. Lu, no, this cannot be!" </p><p></p><p>The doctor snapped out of his daze, stomping his feet anxiously and shouting, about to rush forward to stop him.</p><p></p><p>Although he revered Lu Changsheng, at a time like this, he had to intervene. As a doctor, he couldn't just watch Lu Changsheng torment Old Xu!</p><p></p><p>But the next scene that unfolded made him abruptly halt his movement, and everyone watched in shock!</p><p></p><p>The motionless Old Xu suddenly sat up, eyes closed, hugging the wine jar and gulping it down!</p><p></p><p>"Glug, glug, glug!"</p><p></p><p>Everyone stared blankly, unable to help but swallow their saliva, was it really that good to drink?</p><p></p><p>Ah, no, this is not the time to think about that!</p><p></p><p>Just now, Old Xu was lying there half-dead, and now he's suddenly sitting up? This is unbelievable!</p><p></p><p>"Ah... ah!" The doctor was dumbfounded, this treatment method, in all his decades of medical practice, he had never seen or heard of it before!</p><p></p><p>Can it really be done this way?</p><p></p><p>One jar of wine was quickly drained by Old Xu, and Lu Changsheng thoughtfully handed him another bottle.</p><p></p><p>Old Xu hugged it and continued to drink greedily, but as he drank, everyone saw tears flowing from the corners of his tightly closed eyes.</p><p></p><p>Huh? The onlookers were puzzled.</p><p></p><p>Soon, Old Xu finished the wine, opened his eyes, and thanked everyone gratefully, "Thank you all for your concern, I'm much better now. I'm still not feeling well, but I'll properly express my gratitude another day."</p><p></p><p>The others heaved a sigh of relief, bidding farewell to Old Xu one by one, casting admiring glances at Lu Changsheng before leaving.</p><p></p><p>They all sighed inwardly, Mr. Lu is truly a remarkable person.</p><p></p><p>The doctor also left, refusing the money Old Xu had given him, then looked at Lu Changsheng with awe.</p><p></p><p>Here is the full English translation of the Chinese excerpt:</p><p></p><p>Xu hesitated, wanting to speak but stopping himself, and finally let out a sigh as he bid farewell.</p><p></p><p>Soon, only Old Xu and Lu Changsheng were left in Xu's home.</p><p></p><p>Old Xu silently got up from the bed, brought a water kettle and poured tea for Lu Changsheng: "Mr. Lu, thank you for today. If it weren't for you, I..."</p><p></p><p>Old Xu kept his head lowered, seemingly unable to look at Lu Changsheng, his speech a bit stuttering.</p><p></p><p>It was as if he had been frightened by the events that happened by the lake the previous night.</p><p></p><p>Lu Changsheng casually found a seat and sat down, taking a sip of the tea before smiling and saying, "It's nothing, it was partly my fault as well. I must have scared you, since you are just an ordinary person..."</p><p></p><p>Old Xu forced a smile. "Mr. Lu is too kind. I know you stood up for me last night. It was my own recklessness, I didn't expect those people to be cultivators, let alone that they would kill so easily."</p><p></p><p>Lu Changsheng shook his head and suddenly said, "Even if I hadn't stood up for you, you might not have died, right?"</p><p></p><p>Old Xu's pupils shrank slightly, then returned to normal as he chuckled awkwardly and sighed, "Mr. Lu is joking. Facing those powerful cultivators, I, an ordinary old man, would have had no chance of survival."</p><p></p><p>Lu Changsheng nodded slightly, his gaze falling on the two empty wine jars on the bed, and said, "I heard from the villagers earlier that you don't touch a drop of alcohol, but judging from your state just now, that doesn't seem to be the case. And these two jars are not low in alcohol content, yet you show no signs of intoxication. Old Xu, it seems you are not only a fishing genius, but also a master drinker."</p><p></p><p>"Hehe, Mr. Lu is too kind. I may have been disoriented from the long unconsciousness, and just felt thirsty, not really thinking about the alcohol. Now that you mention it, I do feel a bit dizzy, I suppose the after-effects are kicking in."</p><p></p><p>Suddenly, Old Xu's face flushed and his body became unsteady.</p><p></p><p>Lu Changsheng smiled faintly and suddenly asked, "Were those two jars of wine good?"</p><p></p><p>"Good... Uh." Old Xu responded instinctively, then froze.</p><p></p><p>Lu Changsheng chuckled and then headed towards the door.</p><p></p><p>"Old Xu, take good care of yourself."</p><p></p><p>"Farewell, Mr. Lu." Old Xu hurriedly saw him off, his steps steady again.</p><p></p><p>Just as Lu Changsheng reached the door, he suddenly stopped and turned around, handing the two wine jars back to Old Xu, saying meaningfully, "One jar is for cleansing the soul, the other for entering dreams. Both are of my own brewing, much better than the previous two. Would you like them?"</p><p></p><p>Old Xu's expression stiffened, and he swallowed hard, then let out a deep sigh.</p><p></p><p>He knew he had been seen through.</p><p></p><p>From when exactly? Thinking back, he felt a chill.</p><p></p><p>Because before waking up today, he actually didn't know that he was...</p><p></p><p>So it seems that yesterday, Mr. Lu had intentionally provoked him...</p><p></p><p>Looking at it this way, Mr. Lu's appearance in Jixing Town was no coincidence either...</p><p></p><p>Ah, he is truly remarkable.</p><p></p><p>Otherwise, in the vast Star Luo Empire, how could he have just happened to come to this Jixing Town?</p><p></p><p>Finally, he took the two wine jars with both hands and bowed deeply:</p><p></p><p>"The fool is intoxicated by the world, I greet you, Mr. Lu."</p><p></p><p>"Haha." </p><p></p><p>Lu Changsheng threw his head back and laughed heartily, his laughter as refreshing as the spring breeze.</p><p></p><p>How interesting.</p>

        <h1>Chapter 332</h1>
        <div class="content">
            <p>Here is the full English translation of the Chinese excerpt:</p><p></p><p>"Come... come to play?"</p><p></p><p>The crowd stared blankly at the place where Lu Changsheng had disappeared. üëäüòÇ‚ùª‚ùæ·îïùì±ùì§x.‚ìí‡πèùïÑ‚òπüç≠</p><p></p><p>"I understand!!"</p><p></p><p>Suddenly, Su Qianghe clapped his hands and exclaimed.</p><p></p><p>The crowd looked at Su Qianghe with puzzlement, Tongxin and Lin Dong exchanging glances, feeling that this scene seemed familiar.</p><p></p><p>In that instant, they had actually seen the figure of Dongge, the Water Kingdom King, in Su Qianghe.</p><p></p><p>Peng Fang, Zuo Choushan, and the others exchanged a puzzled glance, then looked at him suspiciously: "Third Elder, what do you understand?"</p><p></p><p>"Grand Elder, weren't you just asking the Sect Master how he compares to the powerful ones on the rankings? And the Sect Master said he's just here to play. Isn't that obvious enough?" Su Qianghe said excitedly, his face flushed.</p><p></p><p>Obvious? Could there be a deeper meaning in the Sect Master's words?</p><p></p><p>The crowd looked at Su Qianghe blankly.</p><p></p><p>"Hehe." Su Qianghe smiled mysteriously, then reverently said, "The Sect Master's meaning is that those powerful ones on the rankings are mere chickens and dogs to him. The Sect Master can just flick his sleeve, and those on the rankings will be terrified!"</p><p></p><p>Huh?</p><p></p><p>The crowd was dumbfounded. Did the Sect Master really mean that?</p><p></p><p>"Ah, no, that's not right!!!" Su Qianghe suddenly turned pale and started to growl.</p><p></p><p>"Fourth Elder!! With so many disciples watching, be mindful of your image!" Peng Fang hurriedly whispered in a low voice.</p><p></p><p>This Su Qianghe, he's really exasperating, always so noisy.</p><p></p><p>"Ahem." Su Qianghe noticed the strange gazes, and immediately cleared his throat, then instinctively leaned close to Peng Fang's ear and pleaded in a very low voice, "Grand Elder! Wine, wine!! We have no more wine to drink! Wah, my soul-cleansing brew, my dream-inducing brew..."</p><p></p><p>Su Qianghe forgot to use a transmission technique, so everyone present heard it, and their expressions became strange.</p><p></p><p>Peng Fang's expression changed slightly, and he was fed up. He quickly turned around and shouted, "What are you all standing around for? Hurry up and go cultivate? Whoever brings disgrace to the Sect Master's name in the future will be punished!"</p><p></p><p>In an instant, the training ground was empty.</p><p></p><p>"Su Qianghe! Are you sick or something?!" Seeing this, Peng Fang immediately scolded Su Qianghe.</p><p></p><p>But soon, his expression changed again, and a strange feeling swept over him. He was about to break through again!</p><p></p><p>...</p><p></p><p>At the same time, in the area not far from the Xiaoyao Sect, two disciples wearing the same sect attire were shocked to see the Xiaoyao Sect.</p><p></p><p>"Ah, this!"</p><p></p><p>"Are we hallucinating? How did a sect suddenly appear?"</p><p></p><p>"This area is our Chiyang Palace's territory. How dare they? Didn't they even ask about our Chiyang Palace?"</p><p></p><p>"Let's go, let's go back to the palace and report this."</p><p></p><p>...</p><p></p><p>At the entrance of the Human City.</p><p></p><p>Old Turtle and Li Shuyan stood to the side, observing the flow of people entering and leaving the city. They were shocked in their hearts.</p><p></p><p>They were all cultivators, and their cultivation levels were not low.</p><p></p><p>Li Shuyan's gaze was grave. Many of these cultivators were strong...</p><p></p><p>"Shuyan, in Grandpa Turtle's perception, there are quite a few Concealed Celestial cultivators among these people, and even Celestial Dao cultivators can be seen from time to time. Just now in that short while, I've already sensed three of them. In this Divine-Demon Battlefield, it seems that Concealed Celestials are as numerous as dogs, and Celestial Dao cultivators are everywhere. Your Celestial Sun Realm mid-stage cultivation might not be enough, hehe."</p><p></p><p>Old Turtle said mockingly.</p><p></p><p>Li Shuyan's body trembled slightly, and he said solemnly, "Senior Turtle, I will work hard."</p><p></p><p>Old Turtle cleared his throat and said, "It seems I also need to work harder. My strength might not be enough in this Divine-Demon Battlefield."</p><p></p><p>"Let's go into the city."</p><p></p><p>Suddenly, Lu Changsheng appeared in front of them and said softly.</p><p></p><p>"Master," Old Turtle and Li Shuyan immediately bowed.</p><p></p><p>Lu Changsheng nodded, then walked with them towards the massive city gate.</p><p></p><p>At the top of the city gate, the words "Human City" were inscribed.</p><p></p><p>Here is the full English translation of the Chinese excerpt:</p><p></p><p>"A human city? Could it be that there are also an underground city and a celestial city?" The old turtle had some doubts in his heart.</p><p></p><p>At this time, the old turtle was focused on the city name and didn't notice for a while that many people around him had started to focus their gaze on him, their eyes filled with scrutiny.</p><p></p><p>A foreign race?</p><p></p><p>Among the vast crowd outside the city gate, only the old turtle emanated a non-human aura, so he easily attracted attention.</p><p></p><p>"Senior Turtle, they are all looking at you..." </p><p></p><p>Li Shuyan noticed this and transmitted a voice message to the old turtle, who was still looking up at the city name.</p><p></p><p>Huh? Looking at me?</p><p></p><p>The old turtle was taken aback, withdrew his gaze, and looked around. Sure enough, he found that many people were staring at him, their eyes seemingly filled with scrutiny and confusion, and some even had gloomy expressions.</p><p></p><p>Given the old turtle's short temper that could only tolerate Luchengsheng, he immediately felt displeased and directly shouted, "What are you all looking at? Keep staring and I'll gouge out your eyeballs!"</p><p></p><p>Instantly, the clamor outside the human city subsided, and it fell silent, with countless gazes turning towards the old turtle.</p><p></p><p>Luchengsheng's footsteps also came to a halt.</p><p></p><p>The two city guards at the city gate noticed that something seemed to be happening, so they quickly walked over.</p><p></p><p>Li Shuyan's gaze sharpened again, these two city guards were also quite strong... Probably not just at the Shencan realm.</p><p></p><p>"What happened?" </p><p></p><p>The two city guards soon arrived, and one of them asked in a deep voice.</p><p></p><p>"City guards, there is a foreign race." A cultivator looked at the old turtle and then said to the city guards.</p><p></p><p>Huh? A foreign race?</p><p></p><p>The two city guards quickly locked their gaze on the old turtle, following the line of sight of the many cultivators, and their brows slightly furrowed, indeed, it was a foreign race.</p><p></p><p>Involuntarily, weapons appeared in their hands, and they slowly approached the old turtle.</p><p></p><p>Seeing this, the crowd immediately became spirited, the city guards were going to subdue this foreign race!</p><p></p><p>Yes, how could a foreign race just wander around in their human territory? Moreover, many foreign races have joined forces to suppress their human race, so they are particularly displeased with foreign races!</p><p></p><p>Among the human race, there are foreign races, but apart from Lord Sword Sovereign's mount that can transform into a human form and move freely in human territory, what other mount or foreign race can transform into a human and move around? Isn't that just asking for trouble?</p><p></p><p>It's not just like this in the human race, the territories of other foreign races generally don't allow foreign races to move around either.</p><p></p><p>The old turtle raised his eyebrows, well, they want to get rough?</p><p></p><p>Green light suddenly flashed from the fingertips of his sleeves, if these two city guards dared to get rough, he wouldn't hold back...</p><p></p><p>Sigh, it can't be helped, do I have to cause a massacre right after arriving in the human race?</p><p></p><p>Li Shuyan saw this and also secretly activated the Wanjian Yanxue technique, his skin turning red-hot and smoking.  He was naturally on the old turtle's side.</p><p></p><p>Although he was part of the human race, he hadn't developed a strong sense of belonging since just arriving at the Divine-Demon Battlefield.</p><p></p><p>"Gentlemen, please put down your weapons, this is my mount, and it poses no harm to the human race."</p><p></p><p>At this time, Luchengsheng smiled and stopped the two city guards, his attitude extremely amiable.</p><p></p><p>Huh, mount? Mount?</p><p></p><p>The crowd stared blankly at Luchengsheng, then pursed their lips, their gazes relaxing a bit, though there was still some displeasure, and they didn't dare to speak up.</p><p></p><p>After all, being able to have a foreign race mount meant that this person's strength was not to be underestimated.</p><p></p><p>"Fellow Daoist, so it's your mount, then it was a misunderstanding. But in the human territory... Fellow Daoist, it's better for your mount to reveal its true form, to avoid too much misunderstanding."</p><p></p><p>The two city guards put away their weapons, and one of them smiled and cupped his hands.</p><p></p><p>"No need to bother." Luchengsheng smiled and then headed towards the city.</p><p></p><p>The old turtle spat, gave the crowd a sidelong glance, and pulled Li Shuyan, striding after Luchengsheng.</p><p></p><p>The crowd watched with their eyes twitching.</p><p></p><p>Well, to be so arrogant in their human territory, isn't that a bit too much?</p><p></p><p>They had never seen such a strong-willed foreign race mount before, Lord Sword Sovereign's mount didn't seem to be this unruly, right?</p>

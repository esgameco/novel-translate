        <h1>Chapter 193</h1>
        <div class="content">
            <p>Here is the full English translation of the Chinese excerpt:</p><p></p><p>Recently, in the area south of Canglanzhu, the Xiaoyao Sect has completely blown up. ‚òÖüò≥‚ùª‚ûàùî∞ùíΩùìæ–ñ.ÔΩÉ„Ññùêåüçìüêú</p><p></p><p>In addition to the sect's heavenly abode-like headquarters, the treatment of the disciples is terrifying.</p><p></p><p>Putting aside the various dreamlike treatments, the core disciples can receive fifty colorful spirit stones every month!</p><p></p><p>The inner sect disciples can receive twenty colorful spirit stones every month!</p><p></p><p>The outer sect disciples can receive ten colorful spirit stones every month!</p><p></p><p>Even the menial disciples... receive one colorful spirit stone every month!</p><p></p><p>You should know that the inner sect disciples of the three major nine-grade sects can only receive a hundred top-grade spirit stones per month, and only a handful of core disciples can receive one colorful spirit stone...</p><p></p><p>So, the treatment of the menial disciples in the Xiaoyao Sect is comparable to the treatment of the core disciples in the three major nine-grade sects. </p><p></p><p>This is simply outrageous! They must be incredibly wealthy!</p><p></p><p>But... the Xiaoyao Sect has been recruiting disciples for five days, and the number of people who have successfully passed the assessment and entered the sect is only over a hundred!</p><p></p><p>Even among them, most are menial disciples, and the rest are all outer sect disciples.</p><p></p><p>Inner sect disciples and core disciples... not a single one!</p><p></p><p>The admission threshold is so high that it's mind-boggling.</p><p></p><p>However, everyone is at ease when they think about the Xiaoyao Sect's terrifying treatment.</p><p></p><p>It should be like this, this is reasonable.</p><p></p><p>If it were that easy to join the Xiaoyao Sect, they would doubt its authenticity.</p><p></p><p>Because that would be no different from falling into a pie from the sky.</p><p></p><p>Outside the Xiaoyao Sect, </p><p></p><p>many cultivators who failed the assessment left dejectedly in groups, the Xiaoyao Sect is no longer an option for them, so they can only hurry to the three major sects while there's still time.</p><p></p><p>Cai Xu and Huang Bin volunteered to maintain order outside, </p><p></p><p>their faces beaming with pride as they weaved through the vast crowd, their menial disciple badges swinging back and forth...</p><p></p><p>Everyone looked at them with envy and jealousy.</p><p></p><p>Especially the cultivators from Feiyun City, many of them recognized Cai Xu and Huang Bin, and their expressions were not good.</p><p></p><p>When Cai Xu and Huang Bin passed by them with indifferent expressions, they tried to force a smile, but just couldn't.</p><p></p><p>"Abin, look at them, they can't even smile anymore, haha!" Cai Xu transmitted.</p><p></p><p>Huang Bin was also overjoyed in his heart.</p><p></p><p>While the Xiaoyao Sect was still conducting the disciple assessment,</p><p></p><p>the Blood Flame Pavilion, the Shenluomen, and the Nihong Pavilion were in a state of collapse.</p><p></p><p>Although countless cultivators had come to these sects for the assessment in recent days, they were mostly of average or inferior aptitude.</p><p></p><p>They knew very well that the top talents had all been snatched up by the Xiaoyao Sect!</p><p></p><p>These cultivators only came to the three major sects because they had no hope of joining the Xiaoyao Sect.</p><p></p><p>In other words, their three major sects have become the backup option???</p><p></p><p>"Bang!"</p><p></p><p>In the Blood Flame Pavilion, Fan Hong slammed his fist on the table, his face turning black with anger.</p><p></p><p>He shouted,</p><p></p><p>"This Xiaoyao Sect is so arrogant, they don't leave any room for us three major sects at all."</p><p></p><p>The elders all trembled, and one after another voiced their opinions:</p><p></p><p>"Pavilion Master, the Xiaoyao Sect is able to offer such generous treatment, it must not be simple..."</p><p></p><p>"Not simple? I think they're just nouveau riche, maybe they just happened to find a vein of colorful spirit stones!"</p><p></p><p>"That's right, after all, we haven't even seen the Xiaoyao Sect's patriarch, let alone its elders. Even the recruitment of disciples is just handled by some minor officials. Who knows what the true strength of the Xiaoyao Sect is? Maybe it's just an empty shell."</p><p></p><p>"We can't say that for sure, the Xiaoyao Sect is so reckless, they must be no weaker than us three major sects."</p><p></p><p>Here is the full English translation of the Chinese excerpt:</p><p></p><p>"......"</p><p></p><p>Fan Hong took a light breath and said in a solemn voice, "Drive away those crooked and deformed ones outside."</p><p></p><p>After saying that, he suddenly paused.</p><p></p><p>Only to see Fan Hong's eyes flashing for a moment, and then he looked up and said indifferently, "The Senluo Gate has already sent people here, and they are now outside the Zhai. Elder, you take a few elders and go to the Xiaoyao Sect with those elders from the Senluo Gate."</p><p></p><p>The Senluo Gate has already sent people? </p><p></p><p>The elders looked at each other, and there was a slight smile on their faces. It seems that the Xiaoyao Sect has already taken away all the good seedlings, and the Senluo Gate is even more anxious than their Huoyan Zhai.</p><p></p><p>The next moment, Chen He, the Grand Elder, stood up and bowed, asking, "Zhai Master, when we get to the Xiaoyao Sect... are we going for diplomacy or force?"</p><p></p><p>Fan Hong's eyes flashed with a hint of coldness, and he said in a deep voice, "First calm down and try to probe. If the other party indeed has strength, just come back and discuss it further. But if the other party is strong on the outside but weak on the inside... hehe."</p><p></p><p>Chen He immediately understood, and then bowed respectfully and named a few elders to leave the council hall.</p><p></p><p>At the same time,</p><p></p><p>In the Nihong Pavilion.</p><p></p><p>"Pavilion Master, the spies from the Huoyan Zhai and the Senluo Gate have sent messages, and the two Grand Elders are leading some people to the Xiaoyao Sect."</p><p></p><p>"Hmm."</p><p></p><p>...</p><p></p><p>Outside the Xiaoyao Sect.</p><p></p><p>The disciple assessment was still progressing in an orderly manner,</p><p></p><p>Countless sighs rose and fell.</p><p></p><p>It's too difficult, really too difficult!</p><p></p><p>The recruitment standards of the Xiaoyao Sect are really too high!</p><p></p><p>It's like sifting the sand from the big waves.</p><p></p><p>Many failed cultivators were extremely dissatisfied and could no longer hold back their jealous gazes towards Cai Xu and the two people who were proudly wandering around the field.</p><p></p><p>"I'm not satisfied!! Why can they two at the peak of tribulation crossing become servants?!"</p><p></p><p>"Yes, I'm not satisfied either. We are earth immortal second-grade, but can't even become servants, how come they can! They must give an explanation!"</p><p></p><p>"Unfair!"</p><p></p><p>"......"</p><p></p><p>Seeing someone taking the lead, many cultivators suddenly expressed their discontent.</p><p></p><p>Cai Xu and Huang Bin's faces stiffened, not expecting to be targeted so suddenly. It seems that their arrogance in the past few days has irritated these cultivators.</p><p></p><p>Seeing the situation becoming more and more restless, the two of them seemed a bit at a loss.</p><p></p><p>At this moment, a terrifying aura swept over and disappeared in an instant!</p><p></p><p>The riotous cultivators turned pale, collectively fell silent, and looked around in terror.</p><p></p><p>What was that aura just now? How terrifying it was!</p><p></p><p>"The affairs of my Xiaoyao Sect have their own reasons, and you all must obey even if you are not satisfied!" </p><p></p><p>At this time, Zhu Xingqiu, the one in charge of the overall assessment, said expressionlessly.</p><p></p><p>Zhu Xingqiu was the former Grand Elder of the Qingxuan Heavenly Snake Manor, and now serves as the Grand Steward in the Xiaoyao Sect.</p><p></p><p>His strength has already reached the peak of Immortal King ninth-grade, just a step away from ascending to Immortal Saint.</p><p></p><p>Not to mention Zhu Xingqiu as the Grand Steward, even the other stewards or protectors in the Xiaoyao Sect would be a devastating blow to the three major sects...</p><p></p><p>Moreover, the core disciples of the Xiaoyao Sect are all Transcendent Immortal level figures.</p><p></p><p>As for Tong Xin and Lin Dong, their identities are slightly special, they are the core disciples of the Xiaoyao Sect, and are also the contemporary Holy Children!</p><p></p><p>Although the two of them are only at the Immortal King level in terms of strength, it doesn't matter at all, and their cultivation speed is known to all.</p><p></p><p>All the disciples are also convinced of this.</p><p></p><p>Everyone came from the Qingxuan Manor and followed over, </p><p></p><p>so they naturally know the special status of Tong Xin and Lin Dong, </p><p></p><p>who used to be the two waiters at the Longevity Wine Inn in Qingxuan Manor...</p><p></p><p>And everyone is already quite familiar with them, hehe.</p><p></p><p>In short, it's very reasonable.</p>

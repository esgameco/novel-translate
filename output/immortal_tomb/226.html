        <h1>Chapter 226</h1>
        <div class="content">
            <p>Here is the full English translation of the Chinese excerpt:</p><p></p><p>The Ancestral Celestial Realm. - Flowing~*&#039;¨¯¨&#039;*·Dance~ ➅❾𝓢нᵘ᙭.𝓒𝐎𝓶 ~Dance*&#039;¨¯¨&#039;*·~Flowing-</p><p></p><p>Boundless and vast, the systems of gods, demons, Taoists, Buddhists, monsters, and mortals densely fill every corner of the Ancestral Celestial Realm.</p><p></p><p>The Ancestral Celestial Realm is divided into six great celestial states, within which the systems of the divine Tao and Buddhism, as well as a small number of demons and monsters, coexist.</p><p></p><p>Beyond the six great celestial states, closer are the Fallen Abyss of Demons and the Endless Abyss of Monsters.</p><p></p><p>As the name suggests, these two places are the strongholds of countless great demonic overlords.</p><p></p><p>.........</p><p></p><p>Tuocang Domain is an inconspicuous small domain located to the east of the Primordial Celestial State.</p><p></p><p>Within Tuocang Domain, there is a small town, situated in a remote location, named Smoke and Rain.</p><p></p><p>In the morning, the sky was filled with a fine drizzle.</p><p></p><p>Two figures, one tall and one short, were approaching the town from a distance.</p><p></p><p>The young one, looking into the misty outlines gradually becoming clearer, had an expectant gaze, and then respectfully looked at the tall figure in front of him, asking, "Master, have we arrived at the destination?"</p><p></p><p>Lu Changsheng was walking in the fine rain, a smile in his eyes, and he said, "Yes."</p><p></p><p>Hearing this, the young one's travel-worn face broke into a smile, finally able to rest.</p><p></p><p>He had been following the master, wandering here and there, for over a hundred years now...</p><p></p><p>It had been fun, but after a while, he couldn't help but feel a bit weary in his heart.</p><p></p><p>He wanted to stop and calm his mind.</p><p></p><p>Just recently, they had arrived in this vast and unfamiliar world, and the young one knew nothing about it. </p><p></p><p>He had only heard the master say that this place was called the Ancestral Celestial Realm.</p><p></p><p>Soon, they arrived at the dilapidated town gate, with the faded words "Smoke and Rain" written above.</p><p></p><p>There were no guards at the gate, and Lu Changsheng and the young one smoothly entered the town, following a few elderly and children.</p><p></p><p>Various hawkers' cries filled the air.</p><p></p><p>"Hot buns, buns...."</p><p></p><p>"Sir, on such a day, wouldn't you like to have a bowl of hot vegetable soup to warm yourself up? The fried flatbread has just come out of the oven, paired with the soup, it's a delicacy. Would you like some fried flatbread?"</p><p></p><p>"The Spring Fragrance Inn is open, welcome new and old customers, the drinks are free today, but the ladies are not free~~"</p><p></p><p>"Oh, old madam, your calculations are quite sharp. If one can drink for free in your Spring Fragrance Inn, I'm afraid they won't be able to resist getting a lady as well, right?"</p><p></p><p>"......"</p><p></p><p>Walking behind Lu Changsheng, the young one swallowed, feeling quite tempted.</p><p></p><p>It had been a while since he had been in such a lively small town.</p><p></p><p>And as far as he could see, there were very few cultivators, mostly just ordinary mortals.</p><p></p><p>"Master, would you like to eat some buns?"</p><p></p><p>Finally, the young one couldn't hold back anymore, smacking his lips and asking.</p><p></p><p>Lu Changsheng turned his head and glanced at him, "Okay."</p><p></p><p>"Ahem." The young one cleared his throat and hurriedly bowed, then ran towards the stall, waving his hand and shouting, "Boss, I'll take twenty buns!"</p><p></p><p>The stall owner was taken aback, this guy, twenty buns, can he really eat that much? But then he was delighted, grabbing a large oiled paper while lifting the steamer lid, the hot steam billowing, and he started to work quickly.</p><p></p><p>When the young one reached the stall, the owner handed him a large package, smiling and saying, "Here you are, young man, your buns."</p><p></p><p>The young one took them with a smile, but remembering that the master was still waiting, he became a bit hurried: "Boss, how much?"</p><p></p><p>The owner laughed, "Ten copper coins."</p><p></p><p>Ah? The young one was dumbfounded, he realized he didn't have any copper coins on him at all!</p><p></p><p>The money he had with him was basically...</p><p></p><p>Here is the full English translation of the Chinese excerpt:</p><p></p><p>They were all colorful spirit stones.</p><p></p><p>"This... this..." Tongxin felt embarrassed as he touched the scalding hot bun in his hand.</p><p></p><p>New 69 Book Bar → 69𝒔𝒉𝒖𝒙.𝒄𝒐𝒎</p><p></p><p>At this moment, a long hand reached out from beside him, palm open, with exactly ten copper coins on it.</p><p></p><p>Tongxin was startled, and turned his head to see Lu Changsheng.</p><p></p><p>The old man saw the two knew each other, so he smiled and put the coins away.</p><p></p><p>...</p><p></p><p>"Senior, this time it was Tongxin's forgetfulness that caused this trouble..."</p><p></p><p>Tongxin, carrying a large bag of buns, said in a muffled voice while eating.</p><p></p><p>Lu Changsheng put the last bun into his mouth and said, "No matter."</p><p></p><p>He had eaten two, which was enough, so the remaining eighteen were left for Tongxin.</p><p></p><p>Hearing this, Tongxin felt relieved. During this period, living with the senior, he had come to understand him quite well.</p><p></p><p>Generally, the senior would not care about such trivial matters.</p><p></p><p>After a while,</p><p></p><p>the two arrived at a less crowded alley.</p><p></p><p>Lu Changsheng looked around at the quiet environment and said, "Let's set up the medical clinic here."</p><p></p><p>Hearing this, Tongxin was not surprised. The senior had already told him about this, and brought him here to be an apprentice pharmacist. He temporarily put away the buns and pointed to the dilapidated loft in front, saying, "Senior, is it this one? Then let me go find a property agent to lease it."</p><p></p><p>As he spoke, he turned and prepared to go find the agent he had seen on the way here.</p><p></p><p>But Lu Changsheng said, "This area is a bit more spacious, let's build our own place."</p><p></p><p>Tongxin was slightly taken aback, and before he could say anything, he saw an ancient courtyard appear out of thin air!</p><p></p><p>He had already witnessed the senior's ability to conjure things out of nowhere.</p><p></p><p>What surprised him even more was that the appearance of this courtyard was exactly the same as the former Changsheng Inn, except for one word!</p><p></p><p>The plaque on the courtyard gate had changed from "Changsheng Inn" to "Changsheng Medical Clinic".</p><p></p><p>"Don't just stand there, go and purchase this land, to avoid future troubles," Lu Changsheng said lightly, then opened the gate and stepped into the courtyard.</p><p></p><p>"Yes, yes, yes." Tongxin pursed his lips, took a deep look at the courtyard, and then ran off.</p><p></p><p>At the same time,</p><p></p><p>as Lu Changsheng stepped into the courtyard, he stood still with his hands behind his back. He looked around the courtyard, the fragrance of incense lingering, the birdsong and flower fragrance.</p><p></p><p>The exterior was similar, but compared to the former Changsheng Inn, the layout and other aspects were vastly different.</p><p></p><p>Quiet, very quiet.</p><p></p><p>The alley where the Changsheng Medical Clinic was located was already peaceful, with the din of the bustling city only faintly audible. Now, within this Changsheng Medical Clinic, all the complexity seemed to fade away.</p><p></p><p>Lu Changsheng looked at the green vegetable patch in the courtyard, the swaying peach blossom tree, and the fish swimming in the small pond, then stepped towards the interior of the clinic.</p><p></p><p>The interior was no longer the same layout as before.</p><p></p><p>Behind the wooden platform, the herb cabinets covered the entire wall, filled with a complete assortment of medicinal herbs.</p><p></p><p>The rocking chair, however, was still the same as before.</p><p></p><p>The wine tables of the former Changsheng Inn were gone, replaced by a long table and several cotton beds.</p><p></p><p>On the long table, a tea set was arranged, with billowing steam rising from the boiling water, the fragrance of tea permeating the air.</p><p></p><p>For a medical clinic, drinking tea is more nourishing.</p><p></p><p>Lu Changsheng went over and poured himself a cup of tea, then headed towards the back garden while sipping it.</p><p></p><p>The back garden was no longer a wine cellar, but a medicinal herb garden, planted with various herbs that were both aesthetically pleasing and medicinally valuable.</p><p></p><p>Lu Changsheng's eyes showed a smile, the herbs were growing well.</p><p></p><p>He then turned and walked back to the clinic, put down his cup, and went to the rocking chair to lie down, falling asleep while inhaling the fragrance of tea.</p>

        <h1>Chapter 423</h1>
        <div class="content">
            <p>Here is the full English translation of the Chinese excerpt:</p><p></p><p>Pacify the soul, calm the soul, slay the soul...</p><p></p><p>Ye Xunmang's eyes were greatly shaken as he looked at the score in Lu Changsheng's hands.</p><p></p><p>This was actually a scroll of a special soul-slaying musical technique. Judging from the terrifying experience just now, it was not an ordinary soul-slaying method.</p><p></p><p>He, Ye Xunmang, was revered as the Qin Saint by the people of the ancient Yunlan nation, yet he could not even play the prelude "Pacify the Soul" from this scroll well!</p><p></p><p>It was clear that this musical score was absolutely extraordinary for him.</p><p></p><p>And now, he had already gifted this scroll to the Gentleman in Blue, and would no longer have access to it.</p><p></p><p>But it was for the best. In his hands, this precious treasure would only be wasted, like a precious pearl covered in dust.</p><p></p><p>Only in the Gentleman in Blue's hands could it unleash its true brilliance.</p><p></p><p>At this moment, Lu Changsheng tossed the score over.</p><p></p><p>Ye Xunmang was stunned for a moment, then quickly hugged the score to his chest, looking puzzled at Lu Changsheng.</p><p></p><p>Lu Changsheng said indifferently, "To extinguish one's soul, I have over ten thousand methods, this musical score is dispensable to me."</p><p></p><p>Shua!</p><p></p><p>Cloud Aoye was shocked and took in a cold breath.</p><p></p><p>Over ten thousand methods? </p><p></p><p>Isn't that terrifying?</p><p></p><p>Cloud Aoye instinctively did not believe it, but when he glimpsed Lu Changsheng's calm expression, he subconsciously believed it.</p><p></p><p>Yes, a figure as powerful as the Gentleman in Blue, there's no need for him to boast to him and Uncle Ye.</p><p></p><p>Moreover, the Gentleman in Blue truly returned the score to Uncle Ye, without the slightest reluctance on his face.</p><p></p><p>Ye Xunmang's eyes were also shaken. His intuition told him that the young man before him was not exaggerating, but speaking the truth...</p><p></p><p>This...</p><p></p><p>What kind of extraordinary figure have they encountered in this remote little town?</p><p></p><p>Could it be that he has reached the Shenling Realm?</p><p></p><p>Ye Xunmang suddenly glanced at the old turtle beside him, and quickly shook off the unrealistic thoughts in his mind!</p><p></p><p>No, the Gentleman in Blue must be beyond the Shenling Realm!</p><p></p><p>After all, in Ye Xunmang's eyes, even the terrifying old servant was at least a super expert at the Shenling Realm, since the old servant could crush him, a peak Shenwu expert, with a single palm!</p><p></p><p>Then the cultivation of the Gentleman in Blue as his master, was unimaginable!</p><p></p><p>Bang!</p><p></p><p>Ye Xunmang suddenly knelt down.</p><p></p><p>Cloud Aoye's heart trembled, and he also dared not stand, quickly kneeling down as well.</p><p></p><p>Ye Xunmang clasped his hands sincerely, "Great Lord, even before I cultivated the Dao, I was already obsessed with the Qin path. I have long been revered and even titled the Qin Saint. I was also arrogant and complacent, and gladly accepted this title."</p><p></p><p>"Until yesterday, I was fortunate enough to hear Your Lordship's heavenly music, and I realized that I have been living in a well, looking at the sky all along! And this title of Qin Saint has made me feel extremely ashamed and embarrassed...!"</p><p></p><p>"So what do you want to do?" Lu Changsheng looked at him calmly.</p><p></p><p>Ye Xunmang's face flushed, his tone a little hurried and hopeful, "I want to... become your disciple."</p><p></p><p>"I do not take disciples."</p><p></p><p>Before Ye Xunmang could finish speaking, Lu Changsheng refused.</p><p></p><p>Instantly, Ye Xunmang's expression froze, and his entire being deflated.</p><p></p><p>The kneeling Cloud Aoye did not dare to speak, also sighing in his heart, feeling sorry for his Uncle Ye.</p><p></p><p>Only the old turtle was not at all surprised, as if he knew that Lu Changsheng would refuse.</p><p></p><p>"Great Lord, is it that you feel I am not a promising talent?" Ye Xunmang looked up bitterly.</p><p></p><p>Lu Changsheng shook his head, "No, that's not it."</p><p></p><p>Hearing this, Ye Xunmang's eyes were filled with a thirst for knowledge. He wanted to know why Lu Changsheng was unwilling to accept him as a disciple, not even considering it.</p><p></p><p>"Don't misunderstand." Lu Changsheng said seriously, "The Qin path, I only know a little bit about it. How could I dare to accept a disciple and mislead him?"</p><p></p><p>Ye Xunmang, Cloud Aoye: "......"</p><p></p><p>What a "little bit".</p><p></p><p>At this moment, Ye Xunmang really wanted to say: Great Lord, please mislead me, I am willing, I am very willing!</p><p></p><p>But Ye Xunmang knew in his heart that this was just the Gentleman in Blue's polite rejection.</p><p></p><p>Lu Changsheng shook his head and smiled. He truly only knew a little bit, be it medicine, swordsmanship, the Qin path, and so on.</p><p></p><p>Thinking back to the Celestial Demon Battlefield...</p><p></p><p>Here is the full English translation of the Chinese excerpt:</p><p></p><p>At that time, Jian Wuhui also wanted to become a disciple, but he was rejected by him as well.</p><p></p><p>It was just an excuse about the "Ruthless Sword", deceiving him.</p><p></p><p>Ye Xunwang still did not want to give up easily, as this opportunity might not come again, so he respectfully said, "Sir, would you like to come with us to the capital city? That way we can accommodate you better, as this place is quite remote after all."</p><p></p><p>Ye Xunwang thought that perhaps his request to become a disciple was too presumptuous, and they had known each other for too short a time, so the Gentleman in Blue had refused.</p><p></p><p>If the Gentleman in Blue was willing to visit the capital city, then they could serve him wholeheartedly. Even a stone statue would be moved, so perhaps he could succeed in becoming his disciple then.</p><p></p><p>Beside him, Cloud Aoye nodded his head rapidly like a pecking chicken. Having such an esteemed figure visit the capital city would naturally be a good thing. If his father the King could find a way to curry favor with this person, it would only bring benefits and no harm to their Cloud Lan Ancient Nation's current situation.</p><p></p><p>Lu Changsheng glanced at the newly built small courtyard, and before he could speak, the old turtle suddenly chuckled embarrassedly, "Master, how about we go to the capital city for a visit?"</p><p></p><p>The old turtle wanted to go to the capital city, thinking it should be more fun there.</p><p></p><p>"Alright then," Lu Changsheng nodded after a moment.</p><p></p><p>Ye Xunwang and Cloud Aoye were immediately overjoyed!</p><p></p><p>Before parting ways, they said they would come invite Lu Changsheng the next day to go to the capital city together.</p><p></p><p>...</p><p></p><p>As night fell, Luo Qian stealthily appeared by the courtyard of the Youpinglake.</p><p></p><p>He was about to meet that Gentleman in Blue, and Luo Qian hurriedly calmed the fear and nervousness in his heart.</p><p></p><p>After steadying his nerves, Luo Qian gathered his courage and knocked on the courtyard gate.</p><p></p><p>Knock, knock, knock.</p><p></p><p>The gate soon opened, and the old turtle stared at the person in front of him, sternly demanding, "If you don't have a good reason, Grandpa Turtle will send you to the Spirit Realm right away."</p><p></p><p>Luo Qian immediately knelt down in fright, although he didn't know what the Spirit Realm was, but it sounded like not a pleasant place.</p><p></p><p>"This humble one has news about a peerless treasure that the Gentleman in Blue will surely like!"</p><p></p><p>Oh?</p><p></p><p>The old turtle's eyes rolled, what treasure in this world could his master possibly like? So far, he had only reluctantly accepted the Great Dao Demon-Subduing Tower, could this person's so-called treasure be even more precious than that?</p><p></p><p>"Speak up then," the old turtle said mockingly.</p><p></p><p>"The, the Heavenly Lotus Seed!" Luo Qian replied.</p><p></p><p>Heavenly Lotus Seed?</p><p></p><p>The old turtle admitted he had never heard of it before, perhaps it was a product of this heaven and earth. He frowned and said, "Couldn't you have also mentioned its effects?!"</p><p></p><p>Hearing this, Luo Qian looked around warily, then lowered his voice, "The effects of the Heavenly Lotus Seed are too terrifying. If the news gets out, it will surely cause a bloody storm. Can I go inside the courtyard to tell the Sir directly?"</p><p></p><p>Bloody storm, how exaggerated.</p><p></p><p>The old turtle's brow furrowed slightly, but of course he would not easily let just anyone disturb Lu Changsheng. A murderous intent appeared on his face as he said, "Just tell me right here. Otherwise, I'll kill you on the spot."</p><p></p><p>Luo Qian was afraid in his heart, so he had no choice but to reveal the effects of the Heavenly Lotus Seed, and immediately mentioned that it was currently in the hands of the incumbent City Lord Zhu Gu.</p><p></p><p>He had expected to see the surprise, greed, and shock on the face of the old servant in front of him.</p><p></p><p>But who knew, the old servant's expression remained impassive, and he even gradually showed signs of impatience.</p><p></p><p>Luo Qian was completely baffled by this.</p><p></p><p>"Divine Martial Realm... that's just trash, haha, the Heavenly Lotus Seed, such rubbish also dares to be called a peerless treasure, and also dares to come and offer it to my master, what a huge audacity!"</p><p></p><p>The old turtle sneered and said.</p><p></p><p>Luo Qian's expression stiffened, the Divine Martial Realm is trash?</p><p></p><p>But before he could recover, the old turtle slapped him, turning him into a mist of blood.</p><p></p><p>"Hmph, a bloody storm, my ass!"</p><p></p><p>The old turtle impatiently snorted and closed the courtyard gate.</p>

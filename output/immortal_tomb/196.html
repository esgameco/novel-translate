        <div class="content">
            <p>Here is the full English translation of the Chinese excerpt:</p><p></p><p>The Xiao Yao Sect has recently finished recruiting disciples. üå∑üçß‚ûÖÔºôsùî•·ëåùêó.‚í∏ùì∏ùïÑüêä‚ô®</p><p></p><p>They have only recruited around 500 people, and even among them, the majority are just auxiliary disciples, with the remaining being outer disciples.</p><p></p><p>They have not recruited a single inner disciple or core disciple.</p><p></p><p>It's really unavoidable, as the talents and potential of cultivators south of the Cang Lan Continent are generally not very high.</p><p></p><p>The embarrassing defeats of the Huo Yan Hall and the Shen Luo Gate against the Xiao Yao Sect are also no longer discussed by anyone.</p><p></p><p>Because after the various sects received the notification, a major event has finally erupted across the three domains of Linlang, Tian, and Di.</p><p></p><p>The Myriad Sects Grand Competition, which takes place once every 10,000 years, is about to begin!!</p><p></p><p>The Myriad Sects Grand Competition is the grandest event in the Linlang Heavens, where the cultivation world is most prosperous.</p><p></p><p>Every time the Myriad Sects Grand Competition is held, many sects will stand out from the countless sects like stars, gaining great fame.</p><p></p><p>Apart from the strict division of sect ranks, there is also the ranking within the same rank!!</p><p></p><p>For example, the Huo Yan Hall, the Shen Luo Gate, and the Ni Hong Pavilion, their rankings among the 9th-grade sects in the Human Domain have already fallen outside the top 10,000.</p><p></p><p>After each Myriad Sects Grand Competition, the rankings within each rank will be maintained for 10,000 years, until the next grand competition begins!</p><p></p><p>Why do sects of the same rank compete for rankings? Apart from prestige and other reasons, it is also for the abundant rewards! The rewards bestowed by the 9 premier sects!</p><p></p><p>The Myriad Sects Grand Competition is cruel, but also relatively fair.</p><p></p><p>It is a competition between sects of the same rank, 9th-grade against 9th-grade, 8th-grade against 8th-grade, 7th-grade against 7th-grade, and so on.</p><p></p><p>Otherwise, if sects of different ranks compete against each other, there would be no comparison at all!</p><p></p><p>However, there is a special situation...</p><p></p><p>That is, challenging up the ranks!!</p><p></p><p>For example, a 9th-grade sect challenging an 8th-grade sect, an 8th-grade sect challenging a 7th-grade sect, and so on.</p><p></p><p>Challenging two or more ranks above is basically unheard of, and no sect has really done it, because it's practically suicidal.</p><p></p><p>The sight of sects challenging up the ranks is the most eagerly anticipated by countless people in the Linlang Heavens!</p><p></p><p>Although there are very few sects daring to challenge up the ranks in each Myriad Sects Grand Competition, the battles of those sects are thrilling, full of ambition, and extremely passionate, even risking their lives!</p><p></p><p>Because... the implicit rule is that if a sect proposing to challenge up the ranks fails, the opponent sect will definitely not let them off! </p><p></p><p>They will surely destroy the challenger sect to preserve their own reputation.</p><p></p><p>After all, who likes to be challenged by a lower-ranked sect?</p><p></p><p>This is the consequence of failing to challenge up.</p><p></p><p>As for succeeding in the challenge... then the challenger's rank will be replaced, gaining great fame, and they may even receive additional rewards from the premier 1st-grade sects!!</p><p></p><p>Of course, challenging up is not as simple as just wanting to do it, there is a prerequisite - the challenger must be ranked first in their own rank!</p><p></p><p>.........</p><p></p><p>While all the sects were fervently preparing, </p><p></p><p>Outside a courtyard in the rear mountains of the Xiao Yao Sect,</p><p></p><p>Peng Fang suddenly appeared, paid his respects, and reported, "Sect Master, the sect's rank has been determined."</p><p></p><p>This kind of task is simple beyond measure for him.</p><p></p><p>However, he only set it as a 9th-grade sect, because from 8th-grade and above, there would be reporting and review procedures, which are too troublesome.</p><p></p><p>9th-grade is fine, hehe.</p><p></p><p>"Good, summon all disciples to assemble." Lu Changsheng's voice came from the courtyard, though his tone softened towards the end.</p><p></p><p>"Yes." Peng Fang was startled, and quickly complied.</p><p></p><p>He then bowed and disappeared, transmitting the order to Elder Left Chou Shan and the others, </p><p></p><p>"The Sect Master has ordered, all disciples are to assemble at the training grounds!!"</p><p></p><p>Elder Left Chou Shan and the others were greatly alarmed, and immediately began issuing orders.</p><p></p><p>&lt;tt_keyword_ad data-title="Game" data-tag=&quot;Recommended Gems&quot; data-type=&quot;1&quot; data-value=&quot;1913&quot;&gt;&lt;/tt_keyword_ad&gt;</p><p></p><p>.........</p><p></p><p>Xiao Yao Sect, Training Grounds</p><p></p><p>Here is the full English translation of the Chinese excerpt:</p><p></p><p>The Scene.</p><p></p><p>Tens of thousands of figures stood upright.</p><p></p><p>Except for the hundreds of recent new recruits and outer sect disciples, the rest were the elite combat forces that had followed from the Heavenly Scar all along, once belonging to the four major powers of the Qingxuan Town!</p><p></p><p>If all the people from the four major powers of Qingxuan Town had been brought over, the total number of Xiaoyao Sect would not have been just this little...</p><p></p><p>At this moment, </p><p></p><p>at the high platform in the front,</p><p></p><p>there were five figures standing - they were Zhao Wuyou, Su Qianghe, Peng Fang, Zuo Qoushan, and Yin Jiuguai.</p><p></p><p>Behind them were Zhu Xingqiu and other Dharma Protectors and Attendants, about fifty people, each of whom was at least a Huanyuan Immortal Lord!</p><p></p><p>Further back were about a hundred core disciples, at least at the Great Luo Immortal Realm, such as Zuo Qixian and the descendants of geniuses like Su Qianghe and Zhao Wuyou.</p><p></p><p>Next were five hundred inner sect disciples, the lowest of whom were at the Jinxian Realm.</p><p></p><p>Finally, the remaining ten thousand or so were outer sect disciples at the Tianxian Realm!</p><p></p><p>Looking at it this way, the number of miscellaneous servants was relatively small, only a few hundred, and the lowest cultivation was Dixian, oh no, there were even two at the Desolate Peak...</p><p></p><p>As for Tongxin and the long-unseen Lin Dong, as the Holy Sons of the Xiaoyao Sect, they stood beside the Elders.</p><p></p><p>Although all the people on the martial field were silent and dared not speak, their hearts were exhilarated!</p><p></p><p>The Sect Master actually convened all the disciples for the first time!</p><p></p><p>They really hadn't seen the Sect Master for a long time!!</p><p></p><p>And at this time, those miscellaneous servants and some outer sect disciples who had just joined recently were trembling! They couldn't believe it! They were overjoyed to the point of madness!</p><p></p><p>After all, they had only just joined the Xiaoyao Sect, and this was the first time they discovered...</p><p></p><p>In the Xiaoyao Sect, except for them, the new arrivals, every senior brother and sister was actually very strong!</p><p></p><p>That terrifying fluctuation... they couldn't imagine what cultivation they had!</p><p></p><p>Especially the five Elders and fifty Dharma Protectors and Attendants in the front, that aura... was simply terrifying!!</p><p></p><p>They couldn't help but wonder, is this really a Nine-Grade Sect?</p><p></p><p>Although they had not been to higher-grade sects, they could believe that the Xiaoyao Sect was at least a Five-Grade Sect or above!</p><p></p><p>In this case, the Blood Flame Pavilion, the Sengluo Gate, the Nishiki Hall... are nothing!!</p><p></p><p>Joining the Xiaoyao Sect... has really exhausted their lifetime's fortune!!</p><p></p><p>Cai Xu and Huang Bin were extremely nervous at the moment, daring not to breathe a word, finally understanding the true existence of their own sect...</p><p></p><p>Initially, the biggest impression the Xiaoyao Sect gave them was that it was wealthy and powerful... who knew...</p><p></p><p>And also, the senior brother Tongxin who received them, turned out to be the Holy Son! Heavens!</p><p></p><p>While everyone was lost in their thoughts,</p><p></p><p>a figure in blue suddenly appeared on the high platform.</p><p></p><p>The pupils of the crowd shrank, but before they could clearly see the face of the blue figure, Peng Fang's low roar suddenly exploded in the field!</p><p></p><p>"We, pay respects to the Sect Master!"</p><p></p><p>Peng Fang and the other Elders, as well as the Attendants, knelt down in an orderly manner first.</p><p></p><p>Seeing this, the disciples also hurriedly knelt down, their foreheads tightly touching the ground, shouting, "We, pay respects to the Sect Master!"</p><p></p><p>After a moment, when the resounding echo had dissipated, the martial field was as quiet as a needle drop!</p><p></p><p>On the high platform,</p><p></p><p>Lu Changsheng stood with his hands behind his back, his gentle gaze sweeping over the many Elders, Attendants, and disciples.</p><p></p><p>Then his calm voice resounded in everyone's ears,</p><p></p><p>"I have only one thing to say today."</p><p></p><p>"This grand competition among the sects is an excellent tempering opportunity for you Elders and disciples, whether it is the sect's ranking or the sect's grade, strive to go higher."</p><p></p><p>"As your Sect Master, I will say this here today, as long as you are determined enough, even if you end up facing those nine sects that overlook the Linglong Sky, it is no problem..."</p><p></p><p>The martial field was silent, and all the people listened in a daze, especially the new disciples, feeling as if they were dreaming.</p><p></p><p>Finally, when the last words rang out, the minds of the crowd were violently shaken!!</p><p></p><p>"Everything is up to me."</p>

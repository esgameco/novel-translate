        <h1>Chapter 429</h1>
        <div class="content">
            <p>Here is the full English translation of the Chinese excerpt:</p><p></p><p>The Observation Pavilion is the tallest and most solemn building within the royal palace, constantly guarded by elite troops.</p><p></p><p>Normally, without the approval of Lord Yunze, no one is allowed to approach it, and only he himself has the privilege to occasionally reside there.</p><p></p><p>However, the most favored Ninth Prince Yun Aoye and Princess Kening are also occasionally allowed to come here, as they have obtained Yunze's consent.</p><p></p><p>Lu Changsheng and Old Turtle have already moved in there, arranged by Yun Aoye.</p><p></p><p>At this moment, within the Observation Pavilion.</p><p></p><p>There are three figures standing on the observation deck, with the leading figure looking up at the sky, while the other two are standing humbly.</p><p></p><p>The three are Lu Changsheng, Old Turtle, and Yun Aoye.</p><p></p><p>Lu Changsheng shifted his gaze from the sky, looking ahead, and the entire capital city came into view, demonstrating the height of the observation deck.</p><p></p><p>Old Turtle stood beside him, occasionally glancing at Yun Aoye, his eyes darting around, seemingly plotting something.</p><p></p><p>Lu Changsheng turned around and looked at Old Turtle indifferently, saying, "I want to be alone for a while."</p><p></p><p>Old Turtle immediately understood, realizing that his master had seen through his thoughts, and agreed to leave.</p><p></p><p>"Yes, yes, yes! My lord, you can rest well, and Old Turtle will not disturb you!" Old Turtle nodded repeatedly, his mouth curling into a mischievous grin.</p><p></p><p>Lu Changsheng nodded slightly and waved his hand, then turned around.</p><p></p><p>"Great, great one, then Aoye shall take his leave. If you have any needs, you can summon Aoye directly, and Aoye will rush here without hesitation, abandoning everything!"</p><p></p><p>Yun Aoye bowed and said.</p><p></p><p>"Ah, go, go! Don't waste time!"</p><p></p><p>Old Turtle impatiently grabbed Yun Aoye's sleeve and, with a step, the two disappeared from the observation deck.</p><p></p><p>Lu Changsheng looked at the scenery before him, his gaze shifting, and he lightly stepped up onto the stone wall about a zhang (3.3 meters) high, then sat down cross-legged.</p><p></p><p>A guqin (Chinese zither) appeared in front of him, and Lu Changsheng gently placed his hands on it, gazing at the view before him and slowly plucking the strings.</p><p></p><p>...</p><p></p><p>Old Turtle and Yun Aoye left the palace.</p><p></p><p>"Hehe, Aoye, today you must arrange things well," Old Turtle said meaningfully, rubbing his hands.</p><p></p><p>Yun Aoye, also an expert in this field, waved his hand grandly, "Elder Turtle, you can rest assured, Aoye will arrange everything perfectly!"</p><p></p><p>In Yun Aoye's eyes, the Elder Turtle in front of him, although his strength was also extremely terrifying, was more approachable compared to the seemingly indifferent young man in blue. There was less psychological pressure in interacting with him.</p><p></p><p>Yun Aoye believed that as long as he arranged things well for the Elder Turtle today, their relationship would definitely improve further.</p><p></p><p>"Haha, well done!" Old Turtle first smiled in satisfaction, but then suddenly stroked his beard, and asked suspiciously, "Aoye, why do we have to go to the capital city to seek flowers and willows? Isn't it more convenient in the palace?"</p><p></p><p>Yun Aoye's face stiffened slightly, and he said embarrassedly, "Elder Turtle, my father said the palace is a solemn place, and he does not allow Aoye to engage in debauchery in the palace. Although he indulges me, he still has his bottom line."</p><p></p><p>Old Turtle was a bit dissatisfied, but after glancing at the solemn palace, he didn't say anything.</p><p></p><p>At least Old Turtle could see that this Yunze's temperament was not too bad, not one of those incompetent fools.</p><p></p><p>"Forget it, let's go to the city then! Lead the way!"</p><p></p><p>Old Turtle waved his hand.</p><p></p><p>"Hehe, thank you for your understanding, Elder Turtle!" Yun Aoye quickly took the lead, and his impression of the Elder Turtle kept getting better.</p><p></p><p>Yun Aoye knew that with the Elder Turtle's strength, even if he were to destroy the palace, his father probably wouldn't dare to say anything.</p><p></p><p>...</p><p></p><p>Below the Observation Pavilion.</p><p></p><p>The guards remained motionless.</p><p></p><p>Here is my translation of the Chinese excerpt:</p><p></p><p>Stirring, gazing ahead, even as the imperial guards stood watch, a gentle breeze suddenly arose.</p><p></p><p>Looking up at the Observation Pavilion, strains of music descended, flowing and undulating, a soulful melody that stirred the heart.</p><p></p><p>The guards were startled, exchanging bewildered glances before gazing up at the towering Observation Pavilion.</p><p></p><p>Who was playing the zither up there?</p><p></p><p>The guards immediately thought of the mysterious man in blue robes, the one whom even the emperor and officials had to treat with great respect.</p><p></p><p>For the Observation Pavilion was only occupied by that man of blue robes, under the guidance of the Ninth Prince.</p><p></p><p>Gradually, the guards' faces flushed red and their bodies trembled, deeply immersed in the beautiful zither music.</p><p></p><p>As palace guards, they had been fortunate enough to hear the virtuosic playing of the Zither Saint Ye Xiunwang. But compared to this man in blue...</p><p></p><p>Even as outsiders, they could tell the Zither Saint's skill was on a completely different level from this man in blue robes!!</p><p></p><p>Alas! This music could only belong in the heavens!</p><p></p><p>The fervent zither music stirred the guards' blood, conjuring visions of fierce battles on the field.</p><p></p><p>The music grew ever more impassioned, drifting on the wind and slowly spreading through the palace.</p><p></p><p>At this time, in the nearby Weiyang Palace, the Princess Keming sat in a daze, the faint, indistinct zither music reaching her ears. "Where does that music come from?" she murmured.</p><p></p><p>Quickly, a palace maid outside replied, "Princess, the music seems to be coming from the direction of the Observation Pavilion."</p><p></p><p>The Observation Pavilion?</p><p></p><p>Keming's brow furrowed slightly, and she rose and disappeared back into the Weiyang Palace.</p><p></p><p>Outside the palace, the maids, hearing no more sounds from within, were unsurprised. After all, that was just Princess Keming's nature - she seemed interested in nothing.</p><p></p><p>But the music was so beautiful... even if a bit unclear.</p><p></p><p>Could it be the Zither Saint playing? the maids wondered.</p><p></p><p>Meanwhile, Keming's figure appeared at the base of the Observation Pavilion, the soaring zither music now clearer to her ears.</p><p></p><p>Keming glanced at the guards, lost in the music and all vigilance forgotten, then looked up at the Observation Pavilion for a moment, her eyes blinking.</p><p></p><p>This was not the music of Uncle Ye. </p><p></p><p>Who then was the one playing, and how had they gained access to this place of such special significance?</p><p></p><p>Keming hesitated briefly, more curious than she had ever been.</p><p></p><p>She knew that anyone able to enter the Observation Pavilion must be a great personage, an honored guest of the emperor.</p><p></p><p>She should not rashly intrude...</p><p></p><p>Yet, in the midst of that enchanting, beautiful music, Keming found herself powerless to resist, compelled to step into the Observation Pavilion.</p><p></p><p>And soon after Keming entered, many other figures arrived at the Observation Pavilion as well!</p><p></p><p>Among them were the Princes Yunze and Yaoqiang, and the Princess Yuxuan, as well as numerous imperial consorts and even the Empress herself.</p><p></p><p>The area around the Observation Pavilion had never been so lively.</p><p></p><p>The newcomers first paid their respects to Prince Yunze, then glanced knowingly at Ye Xiunwang. </p><p></p><p>Clearly, it was not the Zither Saint playing - they all recognized his style, and this was quite different.</p><p></p><p>Prince Yunze frowned at the enraptured guards, clearing his throat loudly: "Ahem!!"</p>

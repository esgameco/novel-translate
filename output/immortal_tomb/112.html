        <h1>Chapter 112</h1>
        <div class="content">
            <p>Here is the full English translation of the Chinese excerpt:</p><p></p><p>"Xiruo, that senior in the blue robe..." </p><p></p><p>Chu Lang pondered for a long time, and couldn't help but ask.</p><p></p><p>Huang Zhong and Chen He also took a deep breath. After the recent series of events, they felt something was off.</p><p></p><p>The senior in the blue robe had just said he was going to clean up the Inspection Hall, and then the news came that the Inspection Hall had been destroyed...</p><p></p><p>It was all too coincidental.</p><p></p><p>If the Inspection Hall was truly destroyed by the senior in the blue robe, and combined with what the Heavenly Mechanism Pavilion's Pavilion Master had just said about "not daring to calculate"... they shuddered at the thought.</p><p></p><p>Chu Xiruo remained silent, then looked up and said, "Father, Elders, that Inspection Hall must have been destroyed by the senior. The senior is not some Primordial Immortal Lord as you imagined... Anyway, listen to Xiruo's advice, don't try to figure out the senior anymore."</p><p></p><p>At these words, the three of them were shocked!</p><p></p><p>The information was so heavy!</p><p></p><p>...</p><p></p><p>In the sky, a simple palace carriage was flying.</p><p></p><p>Inside the spacious carriage, Nangong Jing and ten elders were sitting, drinking hot tea.</p><p></p><p>"Pavilion Master, why did you..." one of the elders hesitated to ask.</p><p></p><p>Hearing this, the other elders also looked at Nangong Jing, waiting for an explanation.</p><p></p><p>Nangong Jing untied the black silk blindfold around his eyes and placed it aside. What kind of eyes were those...</p><p></p><p>There were no eyeballs in the eye sockets, only an unfathomable blackness.</p><p></p><p>The group of elders quickly bowed their heads, not daring to look directly.</p><p></p><p>Nangong Jing picked up the hot tea, blew on it, and said, "Those three small immortal clans just now, and the one who destroyed the Inspection Hall, should have some connection."</p><p></p><p>Oh?</p><p></p><p>The elders exchanged glances.</p><p></p><p>"Pavilion Master, why didn't we directly ask them just now?"</p><p></p><p>Nangong Jing: "That person, we still need to find him ourselves."</p><p></p><p>The elders fell silent.</p><p></p><p>"How much longer until we reach the Inspection Hall?"</p><p></p><p>Nangong Jing's black eyes looked out the window and asked.</p><p></p><p>"Reporting to the Pavilion Master, it's almost there," the first elder on the left replied.</p><p></p><p>The elders actually understood the purpose of the Pavilion Master's visit to the Soaring Phoenix Immortal Realm - he wanted to find that person.</p><p></p><p>But as for why he wanted to find that person, they didn't know.</p><p></p><p>This group of Heavenly Mechanism Masters had calculated everything, but what they saw was all chaos and haze, unable to calculate anything, and even ended up harming themselves.</p><p></p><p>It was the Pavilion Master who intervened to stop it, otherwise the consequences would have been unimaginable.</p><p></p><p>And the Pavilion Master himself, he openly admitted that he "dared not calculate" - in the Immortal Realm, there weren't many people the Pavilion Master didn't dare to calculate.</p><p></p><p>Nangong Jing retied the black silk blindfold, sighing silently. Even without calculating, he had some guesses about that person.</p><p></p><p>In the vast Immortal Realm, only the Five Great Immortal Emperors were beyond his ability to calculate!</p><p></p><p>Recently, that person's aura had been overlapping infinitely with the memory of an Immortal Emperor's shadow!</p><p></p><p>That's why he must find that person, because... the Immortal Realm urgently needs him now.</p><p></p><p>Nangong Jing held the teacup, and a trace of blood suddenly seeped out from the corner of his mouth:</p><p></p><p>"The divine path is difficult to traverse, the Immortal Emperors are lingering, and the Ancestral Heavenly Realm still refuses to give up. They even want to devour the tigers and swallow the wolves, the entire Immortal Realm... a great calamity is coming."</p><p></p><p>The elders' pupils shrank, looking at Nangong Jing with trembling eyes!</p><p></p><p>"Pavilion Master, you..."</p><p></p><p>Nangong Jing waved his hand to interrupt, gently wiped the blood at the corner of his mouth, and murmured, "The Pavilion's lifespan is running out. I only wish to find him before my end..."</p><p></p><p>The elders' faces turned sorrowful, and they fell silent.</p><p></p><p>They simply poured him another cup of hot tea.</p><p></p><p>Here is the full English translation of the Chinese excerpt:</p><p></p><p>In the central region of the Furao Immortal Realm,</p><p></p><p>On the city walls below the Inspection Pavilion, a figure in a blue robe was seated cross-legged.</p><p></p><p>"Master, the task is complete," the old turtle appeared before Luchang Sheng respectfully.</p><p></p><p>Seeing no response from Luchang Sheng, the old turtle looked up at the frozen Inspection Pavilion above, where there were still flashes of light flitting about, probing.</p><p></p><p>"Tsk tsk, the master has frozen the entire Inspection Pavilion, how convenient for them," the old turtle chuckled, then suddenly said, "Master, didn't you say there was a Primal Immortal Lord from the Spiritual Dust Realm imprisoned there? Where is he?"</p><p></p><p>"He's gone," Luchang Sheng replied indifferently.</p><p></p><p>"Oh." The old turtle was taken aback, then asked, "So where are we going next?"</p><p></p><p>Luchang Sheng took the gourd at his waist, opened the lid, and took a sip before saying, "Nowhere, I'm waiting for someone."</p><p></p><p>The old turtle was puzzled, waiting for someone? Waiting for whom?</p><p></p><p>At the same time, </p><p>A simple imperial carriage soared through the sky, heading straight for the Inspection Pavilion above.</p><p></p><p>Hm?</p><p></p><p>The old turtle seemed to sense something, looked up, and his gaze fixed on the carriage, his eyes flickering slightly.</p><p></p><p>The Heavenly Mechanism Pavilion's Pavilion Master?</p><p></p><p>...</p><p></p><p>In the Inspection Pavilion,</p><p></p><p>Nangong Jing and a group of Heavenly Mechanism Pavilion elders were slowly walking on the icy surface, looking at the frigid space with a slight sigh.</p><p></p><p>Their gaze finally settled on the ice sculpture of Jin Yang.</p><p></p><p>There was no shock in their eyes like the other cultivators, after all, each of them was a Immortal King...</p><p></p><p>"Pavilion Master, this ice is incredibly hard, I can't break it," one of the Heavenly Mechanism Pavilion elders said in amazement as he touched the ice on Jin Yang.</p><p></p><p>The group around Jin Yang's ice sculpture soon attracted the attention of the other cultivators. They were all curiously looking at these strangely dressed people.</p><p></p><p>A scholarly-looking middle-aged man with a black cloth over his eyes, a group of white-haired elders in what seemed like Taoist robes.</p><p></p><p>They were clearly people of some standing.</p><p></p><p>The voices in the area had lowered, no one daring to speak rashly, as many who had come to the Inspection Pavilion recently had powerful backgrounds. They might incur the wrath of the Immortal Emperor Palace if they provoked these people.</p><p></p><p>Nangong Jing touched the ice sculpture, about to say something, when his expression suddenly changed, and he shouted, "Let's go!"</p><p></p><p>He then vanished abruptly!</p><p></p><p>The Heavenly Mechanism Pavilion elders were stunned, but quickly followed after him.</p><p></p><p>...</p><p></p><p>On the city wall below,</p><p></p><p>"Master, could it be that you were waiting for the Heavenly Mechanism Pavilion?" the old turtle asked in surprise.</p><p></p><p>Luchang Sheng's hair fluttered in the wind as he took a sip of wine and nodded slightly.</p><p></p><p>The old turtle was confused, feeling like something had just clicked. Why was Luchang Sheng waiting for the Heavenly Mechanism Pavilion?</p><p></p><p>At that moment, Nangong Jing appeared on the city wall, facing Luchang Sheng with a black cloth covering his eyes, his expression unreadable.</p><p></p><p>Only the fist in his sleeve was clenched tightly, the knuckles turning white.</p><p></p><p>Seeing Nangong Jing arrive, the old turtle finally understood - Luchang Sheng must have been waiting for the Heavenly Mechanism Pavilion's Pavilion Master.</p><p></p><p>"Pavilion Master, you..." the old turtle began.</p><p></p><p>Soon, the group of Heavenly Mechanism Pavilion elders appeared beside Nangong Jing, looking nervous and unsure of what had happened, as their usually calm and collected Pavilion Master seemed agitated.</p><p></p><p>Nangong Jing shook his head, readjusted the black band on his eyes, and then solemnly straightened his robe before slowly walking towards Luchang Sheng.</p><p></p><p>The Heavenly Mechanism Pavilion elders exchanged glances, until their gaze followed Nangong Jing's path and landed on the cross-legged figure in blue...</p><p></p><p>Their mouths hung open, frozen in place.</p>

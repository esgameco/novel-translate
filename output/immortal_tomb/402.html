        <h1>Chapter 402</h1>
        <div class="content">
            <p>Here is the full English translation of the Chinese excerpt:</p><p></p><p>"Yes," replied the Heavenly Dao, and then it disappeared without even glancing at Shen Ting.</p><p></p><p>At this moment, the Heavenly God Plaza was deathly silent! </p><p></p><p>All the cultivators knelt on the ground, holding their breath, not daring to make a sound, not even daring to whisper in the shadows.</p><p></p><p>The utterly despairing Shen Ting had crawled up to Lu Changsheng. He trembled as he lifted his head to look up at that profound and calm countenance: "M-Master."</p><p></p><p>Shen Ting had completely lost all hope. The mysterious methods of the man in the blue robe were unfathomable, and Shen Ting had no power to resist at all. Moreover, the background and identity of the man in the blue robe must be extraordinary, for even the Heavenly Dao showed him such reverence.</p><p></p><p>Lu Changsheng looked quietly at Shen Ting, then reached out and placed his palm above Shen Ting's head. Lu Changsheng's pupils flashed with blue light, and an immense suction force emanated from his palm.</p><p></p><p>Shen Ting's entire body convulsed as if struck by lightning! His lush black hair rapidly turned white, his skin withered and dried up, as if he had lost all moisture.</p><p></p><p>His originally vibrant gaze became dull and obscure. His entire body was rapidly deteriorating at an unbelievable speed.</p><p></p><p>And this process was not at all pleasant. Soon, excruciating pains arose from all over Shen Ting's body, his organs, as if his life was being forcibly torn away, accompanied by a great terror of approaching the underworld.</p><p></p><p>This torment finally caused the increasingly tense Shen Ting to let out a miserable howl: "Ah!!!"</p><p></p><p>It seemed that by screaming out, he could find some relief.</p><p></p><p>In Lu Changsheng's hand, Shen Ting had no ability to resist at all. At this moment, Shen Ting was like a mighty beast trapped in a terrifying abyss, making its final struggles.</p><p></p><p>"Ah!!!"</p><p></p><p>Hearing and seeing Shen Ting's agonizing cries under Lu Changsheng's palm, all the cultivators from the various tribes were gripped with fear. Through Shen Ting's expressions and physical changes, everyone could vaguely see that the man in the blue robe was using an incredibly terrifying method to forcibly strip away Shen Ting's life, seemingly wanting to inflict the utmost suffering upon him.</p><p></p><p>"Ah!! Kill me, kill me!!" Shen Ting cried out pitifully, his once powerful voice now weak and feeble. At this moment, he was no longer the mighty Heavenly God Sovereign, but simply a decrepit old man.</p><p></p><p>Lu Changsheng remained unmoved, continuing at the same pace, like peeling off layer after layer.</p><p></p><p>Time passed, and Shen Ting became skin and bones, his appearance grotesque. His aura gradually faded until he had no more life.</p><p></p><p>Only the seemingly frozen expression of agony could reveal the horrific torment he had endured.</p><p></p><p>Lu Changsheng gently removed his palm. Shen Ting's skeletal frame immediately collapsed, the withered skin scattering on the ground and gradually dissipating like dust.</p><p></p><p>The Heavenly God Sovereign, Shen Ting, had perished.</p><p></p><p>At this moment, the Heavenly God Plaza was deathly silent. The cultivators from the various tribes were trembling in fear, still reeling from the terror they had just witnessed.</p><p></p><p>The Heavenly God Sovereign had truly died...</p><p></p><p>On the stone pillars, Bi You and Ao Zhengtian exchanged a glance, both seeing the fear in each other's eyes. Even they, so proud, had been terrified, facing an opponent with such mysterious methods that even the Heavenly Dao revered.</p><p></p><p>The holy scions of the great clans, such as Ao Xing and Bi Qiong, were shivering in fear. They dared not imagine what would happen to them, after they had previously gone to surround the human race.</p><p></p><p>Just then, nine thunderous bell tolls resounded through the heavens, the mightiest in history.</p><p></p><p>The cultivators were startled, and they looked up to see the brilliant golden light of the Myriad Tribes Ranking, one of the three great rankings in the heavens. The name of the Heavenly God Tribe at the top of the ranking had disappeared, replaced by the two large characters "Human Tribe".</p><p></p><p>Here is my translation of the Chinese excerpt:</p><p></p><p>The members of the Sword Regretless group, even though their bodies were covered in wounds, had eyes shining with intensity and could not help but have tears welling up! </p><p></p><p>They - the human race... had actually reached the peak of the Myriad Tribes Ranking?</p><p></p><p>It was like a dream, truly like a dream!</p><p></p><p>At the same time, the human territory in the southeast of the Divine-Demon Battlefield was also staring blankly at this scene!!</p><p></p><p>All the human cultivators were silent, not excited, not exhilarated.</p><p></p><p>Because they felt this scene was illusory, not real at all!</p><p></p><p>Nine consecutive bell tolls sounded again!</p><p></p><p>The Individual Combat Power Ranking also began to shine with dazzling light. The name of the top-ranked Divine Thunder Tribe slowly disappeared, and was replaced by the three words "Lu Changsheng"!!</p><p></p><p>Lu Changsheng?!</p><p></p><p>The human cultivators finally erupted in an uproar!!</p><p></p><p>In fact, the true name of Lord Lu had long been circulating in the human territory - it was this Lu Changsheng!!</p><p></p><p>They saw the humans reaching the top of the Myriad Tribes Ranking, and then saw the hegemon on the Individual Combat Power Ranking was the name Changsheng!</p><p></p><p>The cultivators finally realized - Lord Lu had defeated the Divine Sovereign!</p><p></p><p>Heavens!</p><p></p><p>Wasn't the Divine Sovereign already a Divine Spirit Realm cultivator?</p><p></p><p>But soon, everything fell silent again!!</p><p></p><p>Because on the Individual Combat Power Ranking, after Lu Changsheng's name, four words slowly appeared: "Tribe Unknown"?</p><p></p><p>Tribe Unknown???</p><p></p><p>Whether it was all the cultivators in the human territory or the myriad tribes and Sword Regretless group on the Divine Sovereign Plaza, they were all stunned looking at those four words.</p><p></p><p>Tribe Unknown...</p><p></p><p>Lord Lu, was he not actually human...?</p><p></p><p>Suddenly, nine even more grating bell tolls resounded!</p><p></p><p>The Divine Body Ranking also erupted with light, multicolored and dazzling!</p><p></p><p>At the top of the Divine Body Ranking, the name of Divine Luo first disappeared, then in the shock of the myriad tribes, a name slowly appeared - Lu Changsheng!</p><p></p><p>In front of Lu Changsheng's name, two words were slowly written: "Primordial"...</p><p></p><p>Then an incomplete character was slowly written - "Cha"...</p><p></p><p>But for some reason, just this one character, the Divine Body Ranking seemed to struggle to write, as if it was extremely difficult!!</p><p></p><p>Boom!!</p><p></p><p>The next moment, the Divine Body Ranking violently shook, and the words previously written at the top position all disappeared!</p><p></p><p>Leaving it completely blank there!</p><p></p><p>Heavens and earth fell silent!</p><p></p><p>The pupils of the myriad cultivators trembled infinitely, their teeth clenched tightly!!</p><p></p><p>The myriad cultivators stared rigidly at the calm, cloud-like young man standing in the center, their spiritual souls trembling!!</p><p></p><p>Primordial Longevity...</p><p></p><p>The myriad cultivators were not fools, through these three words they could instantly associate with a legendary constitution!</p><p></p><p>And gradually understand the abnormality of the Divine Body Ranking, understand why it could not even write the character to completion, and in the end erased everything!!</p><p></p><p>Because... that was beyond the Divine Body Ranking itself!</p><p></p><p>The Primordial Longevity Constitution!!</p><p></p><p>How could the Divine Body Ranking have the qualifications to record it?</p><p></p><p>The top hundred divine bodies of the Divine Body Ranking, how could they be on the same ranking as the Primordial Longevity Constitution?</p><p></p><p>Occupying the top of all the rankings, it could be said to be undisputed, even the human race that was supposed to be destroyed, had risen to a peak they had never dared to imagine, all thanks to the glory of Lord Longevity!</p><p></p><p>The myriad cultivators knew, from this moment on, the name Lu Changsheng would resound through the Divine-Demon Battlefield, intimidating the myriad tribes, and the myriad tribes would submit wholeheartedly, daring not to disobey even a single word from Lord Longevity!</p><p></p><p>The myriad cultivators looked reverently at the young man who had not the slightest hint of arrogance, even calm to the bone. They couldn't help but think of the just-deceased Divine Sovereign...</p><p></p><p>Compared to him, the bearing of Lord Longevity was truly what a supreme expert should have.</p><p></p><p>From today onward, who in the world does not know you!</p>

        <h1>Chapter 119</h1>
        <div class="content">
            <p>Here is the full English translation of the Chinese excerpt:</p><p></p><p>In the vast and boundless celestial realms, there are many races that rely on the Five Great Immortal Realms to survive. Among these numerous races, some are quite renowned within the Five Great Immortal Realms.</p><p></p><p>For example, the howling demonic tiger clan, the black mountain tree demon clan, the nine-winged flying wyrm clan, and so on...</p><p></p><p>They lurk in the mountains, the wilderness, and the deep waters...</p><p></p><p>As the territory continues to expand outwards, there are regions that have not been named by the Five Great Immortal Realms, and the eeriness within them is enough to chill one's bones.</p><p></p><p>There are perennially erupting volcanoes that reach thousands of feet high; there are inauspicious lands perpetually swept by icy winds; there are snow-capped peaks that are eternally frozen; there are regions of eternal night where one cannot see their own hand; there are dark forests perpetually shrouded in toxic mists; there are lightning-scorched lands that are like forges of thunder...</p><p></p><p>In the dense mountain ranges surrounding the Five Great Immortal Realms, amidst the swirling mists, the chilling roars of beasts echo.</p><p></p><p>Listening closely, it sounds like the roar of a tiger.</p><p></p><p>"How many years has it been? How many years have I traveled through mountains and forded rivers, going through great difficulties to finally find my clan, yet why are they still unwilling to accept me?" </p><p></p><p>In a mountain stream, a middle-aged man with a bushy beard pounded the ground, his cry tinged with resentment.</p><p></p><p>His voice was not too loud, carrying a hint of grievance, as if he was afraid of being overheard.</p><p></p><p>At first glance, this person was none other than the once majestic and heroic demonic lord Tiger Battle, who had ascended from the Mortal Realm to the Immortal Realms.</p><p></p><p>Since arriving in the Immortal Realms, Tiger Battle has not been happy, and has remained unhappy.</p><p></p><p>In the lower realms, he was the supreme ruler who could do as he pleased, with the rules bending to his will. But in the Immortal Realms, he felt insignificant, with countless beings more powerful than him.</p><p></p><p>He often felt that he was the dimmest star in the vast celestial expanse.</p><p></p><p>Since coming to the Immortal Realms, he no longer dared to call himself "Lord" in front of others, longing for the days when he could proudly proclaim himself as such.</p><p></p><p>Tiger Battle still remembered Lu Changsheng's words, saying that the howling demonic tiger clan was his destiny...</p><p></p><p>But the result? His destiny was nothing but a joke.</p><p></p><p>He didn't gain any fortuitous encounters, only suffering countless hardships.</p><p></p><p>Though he had to admit, that Lu Changsheng fellow did have a knack for naming things, daring to share the same name as the supreme immortal emperor of the Central Immortal Realm.</p><p></p><p>And that turtle-whelp that had given him so much trouble, it was likely from some Immortal Realm race as well. Now that he thought about it, his fear back then was not unwarranted, for the creature came from the Immortal Realms while he was still in the Tribulation Breakthrough stage.</p><p></p><p>Ah, he wondered how his fellow peers like Ji Wuqing, Zhang Youdao, Jiang Yuan, Qin Lianmiao, and Liu Wuxiu were faring... They should have all ascended long ago.</p><p></p><p>If they were living comfortably and prospering, he would feel quite uncomfortable.</p><p></p><p>But it was highly unlikely, for the Immortal Realms were truly cruel, as he had deeply experienced over the past six hundred years.</p><p></p><p>"Well, well, well, if it isn't Tiger Battle? It's been a while, and you look so disheveled!" </p><p></p><p>"Haha, a lowly tiger from the mortal realms thinking of joining our howling demonic tiger clan, how delusional."</p><p></p><p>"Indeed, I wonder what the clan elders are thinking, neither striking him down nor chasing him away."</p><p></p><p>"This mangy tiger has quite the thick skin, hanging around our howling demonic tiger territory for so many years, stubbornly refusing to leave."</p><p></p><p>Five purple-black little demonic tigers strode up to Tiger Battle, mocking him.</p><p></p><p>These little demonic tigers had a pair of wings on their backs, and the distinct tiger markings on their foreheads were particularly striking, exuding an aura of dominance.</p><p></p><p>Here is the full English translation of the Chinese excerpt:</p><p></p><p>The Might of the Tiger</p><p></p><p>Although he was still young, he had not yet revealed his full might.</p><p></p><p>Upon hearing this, Tiger Battle's face remained expressionless. He had long grown accustomed to this over the years.</p><p></p><p>He couldn't be bothered to argue with these fledgling little demon tigers. </p><p></p><p>Of course, he didn't dare to argue with them either. Although these little demon tigers were not particularly powerful at the moment, each and every one of them was a direct descendant of the Roaring Heavens Demon Tiger Clan.</p><p></p><p>The relationship was too delicate, he couldn't afford to provoke them.</p><p></p><p>"Tch, how boring."</p><p></p><p>The five little demon tigers instantly felt a lack of interest and were about to leave with their short legs.</p><p></p><p>This scruffy tiger, he used to have some liveliness on his face, but now he's so quiet.</p><p></p><p>Mocking him didn't give them any sense of accomplishment.</p><p></p><p>After the little demon tigers left,</p><p></p><p>Tiger Battle looked around for a long time, then let out a heavy sigh and silently stood up. </p><p></p><p>He didn't want to keep wasting time with this Roaring Heavens Demon Tiger Clan anymore, he had already spent too much time here.</p><p></p><p>"I shall not linger here, there are other places for me to stay."</p><p></p><p>Tiger Battle sighed again and turned to leave.</p><p></p><p>"Tiger Battle."</p><p></p><p>Just then, an aged voice sounded from behind him.</p><p></p><p>Tiger Battle's body paused, and he turned around in surprise to look at the purple-robed elder in front of him, cupping his hands and smiling bitterly, "Elder, Tiger Battle will take his leave immediately and no longer intrude. All these years, thank you for not driving me away."</p><p></p><p>Shibingzhu's face carried a faint smile as he said, "Stay."</p><p></p><p>"Elder, you can rest assured that I will just leave... Stay? Stay?" </p><p></p><p>Tiger Battle's response trailed off as he realized what the elder had said. </p><p></p><p>Had he heard wrong? After all these years, why would he be asked to stay again? Could it be that his sincerity had finally touched the elder, and he would be able to see the light after the clouds parted?</p><p></p><p>"That's right, stay." Shibingzhu smiled faintly.</p><p></p><p>Tiger Battle's heart was filled with a myriad of emotions - surprise, doubt, and confusion.</p><p></p><p>He asked, "Elder, may Tiger Battle ask why?"</p><p></p><p>Shibingzhu pondered and said, "The Roaring Heavens Demon Tiger bloodline within you is not pure, there is a trace of some other bloodline... Do you know who your birth parents are?"</p><p></p><p>Shibingzhu knew that Tiger Battle had ascended from the lower realm, and he was not surprised by this.</p><p></p><p>After all, the Roaring Heavens Demon Tiger Clan had previously exiled many demon tigers who had committed offenses to the lower realm.</p><p></p><p>Tiger Battle shook his head, "Elder, Tiger Battle has never known his birth parents, as long as I can remember, I have been alone."</p><p></p><p>Shibingzhu sighed and said, "The reason I didn't let you join before was because of the issue with your bloodline. Our Roaring Heavens Demon Tiger Clan has always been of pure blood."</p><p></p><p>"Then why now?" Tiger Battle was puzzled.</p><p></p><p>"Ascending from the lower realm is not easy, and I've observed that you also have a certain recklessness, so stay."</p><p></p><p>Shibingzhu turned and continued, </p><p></p><p>"Follow me, I'll take you to the Blood Fusion Pool to see if we can extract that trace of different bloodline from you."</p><p></p><p>Hearing this, Tiger Battle hurriedly followed along...</p><p></p><p>At the same time, </p><p></p><p>in the Soul Realm, </p><p></p><p>a dark and gloomy realm where countless souls drifted.</p><p></p><p>The blue-robed young man and the hunchbacked old man appeared out of thin air.</p><p></p><p>"Who dares to trespass in the Soul Realm?!"</p><p></p><p>The overwhelming spiritual pressure emanating from Lu Changsheng and the old turtle quickly caught the attention of several soul collectors around them!</p><p></p><p>The clanging of soul chains soon followed as a dozen or so soul collectors rapidly approached Lu Changsheng and the old turtle!</p><p></p><p>The soul collectors' expressions were somewhat grave, they had immediately sent a report upstairs!</p><p></p><p>It didn't matter what else, the fact that these two before them had physical bodies yet could enter the Soul Realm meant they were certainly no ordinary individuals!</p>

        <h1>Chapter 409</h1>
        <div class="content">
            <p>Here is the full English translation of the Chinese excerpt:</p><p></p><p>At this time, Lu Changsheng and the old turtle were in a small, secluded teahouse.</p><p></p><p>The teahouse was relatively quiet, with the tea drinkers sitting here and there, their voices low as they sipped their tea and chatted.</p><p></p><p>However, the customers' gazes would occasionally fall upon Lu Changsheng.</p><p></p><p>They had not seen Lu Changsheng before, but they simply felt that this young man in green was extraordinary.</p><p></p><p>After pouring a cup of tea for Lu Changsheng, the old turtle went back to his seat, picked up the teacup, took a sip, and said with a smile, "Master, this tea is quite good!"</p><p></p><p>Lu Changsheng nodded slightly. He had come here drawn by the fragrance of the tea.</p><p></p><p>Just as the aroma of wine cannot be hidden even in a deep alley, the fragrance of tea is the same.</p><p></p><p>This small teahouse, hidden in such a secluded alley, still had many customers - there was a reason for this.</p><p></p><p>Lu Changsheng couldn't help but think of the peach blossom wine in the Lingchen Realm, which had a refreshing taste that he had not tasted since. </p><p></p><p>Time had flown by, and looking back, that was an event tens of thousands of years ago.</p><p></p><p>Lu Changsheng held the teacup with one hand, the tea water still steaming and emitting a rich aroma. </p><p></p><p>After taking a sip and savoring it, he smiled and said, "It's not bad."</p><p></p><p>Seeing Lu Changsheng's smile, the old turtle was delighted.</p><p></p><p>Through the long years, accompanying the master, wandering and experiencing the world, it was truly a wonderful thing.</p><p></p><p>However, to be honest, the current situation was a bit different from before.</p><p></p><p>In the past, although the old turtle was also considered Lu Changsheng's mount, their relationship was more than just that of master and servant - there was a sense of friendship.</p><p></p><p>But now, the old turtle had an extremely deep reverence for Lu Changsheng.</p><p></p><p>Whenever the old turtle thought about how Lu Changsheng had resurrected the Golden Wheel King from the river of time, he would shudder from head to toe!</p><p></p><p>That was truly defying life and death, reversing the cycle of reincarnation!</p><p></p><p>Such a feat, the old turtle felt his soul trembling, unable to fathom it...</p><p></p><p>From that moment on, the old turtle even felt that Lu Changsheng had become a stranger.</p><p></p><p>The impact of encountering a powerful opponent was still manageable, but resurrection... it had far exceeded that realm.</p><p></p><p>"What are you thinking about?" Lu Changsheng said softly.</p><p></p><p>The old turtle snapped out of his thoughts and smiled awkwardly, "Nothing, nothing..."</p><p></p><p>Lu Changsheng looked up at him. "You're thinking about how I resurrected Han Jinlong, aren't you?"</p><p></p><p>The old turtle was startled, "How did the master know?"</p><p></p><p>Lu Changsheng replied calmly, "From the moment I resurrected Han Jinlong, you've been distracted and have had an even greater reverence for me. How could I not notice?"</p><p></p><p>Hearing this, the old turtle's expression became somber. "Master, how did you manage that resurrection?"</p><p></p><p>"I don't know," Lu Changsheng shook his head. "I just did it."</p><p></p><p>Just did it?</p><p></p><p>The old turtle was taken aback.</p><p></p><p>If that was the case, then he also wanted to do it, but how could he?</p><p></p><p>"Master, when you were in the Lingchen Realm, you once told me that you seemed to have become stronger after leaving the tomb. I've always felt that way, but exactly how much stronger have you become?" the old turtle asked respectfully.</p><p></p><p>Lu Changsheng replied, "I don't know, but so far I haven't encountered anyone who can make me use more than two moves..."</p><p></p><p>Pausing for a moment, he continued, "No, the Reincarnation Demon Child is one exception."</p><p></p><p>Hearing the mention of the Reincarnation Demon Child, the old turtle was immediately distracted, exclaiming, "Master, have you actually fought against the Reincarnation Demon Child?"</p><p></p><p>As soon as he said that, the old turtle self-mockingly smiled. That wasn't a stupid question at all. </p><p></p><p>The Reincarnation Demon Child must have some special abilities, otherwise why would the master have simply imprisoned it in the Soul Realm along with Hunhun?</p><p></p><p>Lu Changsheng took a sip of tea and smiled, "Yes, I've struck it with a single sword."</p><p></p><p>Hearing this, the old turtle was still shocked, even though he had already guessed as much.</p><p></p><p>Here is the full English translation of the Chinese excerpt:</p><p></p><p>The master was a person who defied the cycle of life and death, but they were unable to slay the reincarnation demon child with a single sword...</p><p></p><p>At the same time.</p><p></p><p>Outside the alley, Zhu Qingqing and Xiao Lian passed by.</p><p></p><p>"Ah, Miss, the city is too crowded today, and even with so many people searching, there is still no news of the Qin Immortal."</p><p></p><p>Xiao Lian panted slightly, speaking weakly.</p><p></p><p>Zhu Qingqing was also helpless, but suddenly she caught a faint whiff of tea fragrance and looked towards the less crowded alley.</p><p></p><p>"Xiao Lian, can you smell the tea fragrance?"</p><p></p><p>Hearing this, Xiao Lian's nose twitched, and her eyes lit up. "Miss, there really is the scent of tea, and it smells quite nice."</p><p></p><p>Tianhang City was not small, and this was the first time they had come to this alley, so they were pleasantly surprised.</p><p></p><p>Xiao Lian then swallowed and said, "Miss, I guess we won't be able to find the Qin Immortal anytime soon. How about we go have a cup of tea and rest for a while?"</p><p></p><p>Zhu Qingqing hesitated a bit, but seeing Xiao Lian's hopeful gaze, she could only nod. "I really can't say no to you."</p><p></p><p>"Hehe, the Miss is the best!" Xiao Lian immediately beamed, grabbing Zhu Qingqing's hand and running towards the alley following the tea fragrance.</p><p></p><p>...</p><p></p><p>In the teahouse.</p><p></p><p>Lu Changsheng suddenly asked, "Old Turtle, do you still remember when we first met?"</p><p></p><p>Old Turtle was taken aback, truly stumped by the question.</p><p></p><p>Old Turtle frowned and thought for a long time, then wryly smiled. "Master, I don't remember..."</p><p></p><p>After saying this, he also felt a bit confused. Logically, the day he met the master should be deeply etched in his memory, no matter how long ago it was. But why couldn't he remember anything at all?</p><p></p><p>"Hmm, I don't remember either." Lu Changsheng looked at the tea in his cup, his gaze slightly dazed, lost in thought.</p><p></p><p>Just then,</p><p></p><p>Zhu Qingqing and Xiao Lian finally entered the teahouse.</p><p></p><p>The teahouse owner saw the new customers and slowly rose from behind the counter, coming out and smiling politely, "Welcome, honored guests, to our humble establishment."</p><p></p><p>This movement attracted the attention of the other tea drinkers, and when they saw Zhu Qingqing entering, they were all startled!</p><p></p><p>Miss Zhu?!</p><p></p><p>The tea drinkers quickly stood up from their seats, hurriedly greeting Zhu Qingqing, "Miss Zhu!"</p><p></p><p>"There's no need for such formalities, please continue enjoying your tea." Zhu Qingqing smiled slightly, but when her gaze swept across the teahouse, searching for a seat, her expression suddenly stiffened.</p><p></p><p>Xiao Lian also saw it, freezing in place.</p><p></p><p>In their line of sight, by the window, there was a figure in a blue robe sitting with his back to them.</p><p></p><p>The Qin Immortal?</p><p></p><p>Even without seeing the face of the man in the blue robe, they immediately recognized him!</p><p></p><p>Setting aside other matters, the old servant sitting across from him was none other than the Qin Immortal's own attendant.</p><p></p><p>What a fortuitous coincidence...</p><p></p><p>Zhu Qingqing's heart suddenly started pounding, and she stood there, at a loss, taken aback by the unexpected turn of events.</p><p></p><p>The teahouse owner followed Zhu Qingqing's gaze and paused briefly on Lu Changsheng's back, then smiled casually, "Ladies, please find a seat. The tea and menu are on the wall, just let me know if you need anything."</p><p></p><p>Xiao Lian was the first to regain her composure, gently nudging the dazed Zhu Qingqing and whispering, "Miss, let's sit down first..."</p><p></p><p>Zhu Qingqing hesitated, then she and Xiao Lian quietly found a seat, under the slightly curious gazes of the other tea drinkers. The seat they chose was right next to Lu Changsheng and Old Turtle's table.</p>

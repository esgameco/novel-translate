        <h1>Chapter 406</h1>
        <div class="content">
            <p>Here is the full English translation of the Chinese novel excerpt:</p><p></p><p>Tian Dao looked at Lu Changsheng in astonishment and then trembled as he said, "Lord Changsheng, you actually know about the Soul Realm?"</p><p></p><p>How could an ordinary living person know about the highly special Soul Realm?! </p><p></p><p>Could it be that Lu Changsheng is acquainted with one of the high-ranking officials in the Soul Realm, such as the Heavenly Fiends Seventy-Two Calamities or the Earthly Fiends Thirty-Six Evils?</p><p></p><p>As for the Four Great Spirit Generals, Tian Dao didn't even dare to imagine it. </p><p></p><p>Their status was far too high. Not to mention the Four Great Spirit Generals, even if just one of the Heavenly Fiends Seventy-Two Calamities appeared before him, Tian Dao would show the utmost respect, for their status was truly extraordinary.</p><p></p><p>Although they rarely interacted, the Soul Realm practically governed the order of all the endless void's undead.</p><p></p><p>It was rumored that in every boundless void, there were countless Soul Realm divisions in control, which showed how lofty the status of the Soul Realm's high-ranking officials was.</p><p></p><p>In the endless void, there were many Tian Daos, even innumerable, but the high-ranking officials of the Soul Realm were only a few in number.</p><p></p><p>Fortunately, in most cases, the Soul Realm did not interfere with the outside world, not even the Soul Emperor.</p><p></p><p>Involuntarily, the young man in blue robes before him became even more unfathomable in Tian Dao's eyes.</p><p></p><p>To have some connection with the high-ranking officials of the Soul Realm was truly extraordinary, extraordinary beyond the extraordinary.</p><p></p><p>However, since the Peerless Great Demon was currently not causing any problems, Tian Dao felt somewhat relieved.</p><p></p><p>"I originally wanted to bring it with me, but that brat Hunhun wanted to suppress it in the Soul Realm, so I just went along with his wishes. I don't really care either way," Lu Changsheng said calmly as he sipped his tea.</p><p></p><p>Soul, Hunhun the brat?! </p><p></p><p>Tian Dao was stunned. If he heard correctly, this should be the name of the Soul Realm's Emperor?</p><p></p><p>Hiss!</p><p></p><p>As if realizing something, Tian Dao's illusory figure trembled at the sight of the young man in blue robes.</p><p></p><p>Lord Changsheng actually knows the Soul Realm's Emperor?!</p><p></p><p>Judging from the implication, the Soul Realm's Emperor also treats Lord Changsheng with the utmost respect?</p><p></p><p>Tian Dao's legs weakened, and he knelt down.</p><p></p><p>Lu Changsheng, puzzled by Tian Dao's sudden display of such great reverence, said, "Hunhun came to the Divine-Demonic Battlefield not long ago. It seems you didn't know about that."</p><p></p><p>Tian Dao was startled. Although he wanted to ask about the doubts in his heart, he didn't dare to delve further into the topic of the Soul Realm, so he respectfully said, "Since Lord Changsheng has re-suppressed the Peerless Great Demon, then Tian Dao can rest assured."</p><p></p><p>"Mm-hmm," Lu Changsheng nodded slightly, then finished the tea in his cup, placed the cup down, and looked at Tian Dao's illusory figure before slowly fading into an illusion and disappearing.</p><p></p><p>Tian Dao sensed this and let out a soft sigh of relief, slowly rising and bowing respectfully, "Farewell, Lord Changsheng."</p><p></p><p>After a moment, Tian Dao bitterly smiled, realizing that as the Tian Dao of the Divine-Demonic Battlefield, he was a supreme existence, and his status among the many Tian Daos was not low.</p><p></p><p>Yet, in the face of that mysterious figure and this Lord Changsheng, he felt utterly insignificant.</p><p></p><p>Alas, they were not to be trifled with.</p><p></p><p>Tian Dao could only hope that Lord Changsheng would be a little more restrained and not cause too much trouble for his Divine-Demonic Battlefield.</p><p></p><p>...</p><p></p><p>In the Human Realm.</p><p></p><p>When Jian Wuhui and the others returned triumphantly, the entire clan was in an uproar!</p><p></p><p>The human cultivators sought to find the young man in blue robes to pay their respects, but he was nowhere to be found, leaving them somewhat disappointed.</p><p></p><p>Subsequently, when the cultivators learned that one of the Human Lords, the Golden Wheel King, had perished, their joy and excitement dissipated greatly.</p><p></p><p>The Golden Wheel King had fought for the Human Realm for many years, yet he never got to witness the rise of the Human Realm.</p><p></p><p>For the next month, the entire Human Realm observed a collective silence to mourn the Golden Wheel King.</p><p></p><p>They even erected a massive stone statue of the Golden Wheel King in the center of each city.</p><p></p><p>One day, a year later.</p><p></p><p>The Pantheon Ranking trembled in the heavens.</p><p></p><p>A majestic, indescribable aura descended upon the Human Realm, and Jian Wuhui and the others knew this was the aura of the number one entity on the Pantheon Ranking.</p><p></p><p>However, they did not feel much joy about this.</p><p></p><p>For the previous occupant of that position had been the Divine Celestial Tribe, which had been instantly annihilated by Lord Changsheng.</p><p></p><p>Therefore, the Human Realm should remain low-key in the future. Even if they were to refine the Crystalline Heart and have divine treasures everywhere, they should not be as arrogant and overbearing as the Divine Celestial Tribe.</p><p></p><p>At the same time, in the Heavenly City's main palace.</p><p></p><p>The Old Turtle and the four Human Lords sat there drinking and chatting.</p><p></p><p>Jian Wuhui and the others greatly respected the Old Turtle, not because of anything else, but because of his strength.</p><p></p><p>In a short time, the Old Turtle's strength had actually surpassed theirs!</p><p></p><p>They had countless doubts about this, but when they recalled that he was Lord Changsheng's mount, it seemed to make sense.</p><p></p><p>"Sword Venerable, when the Master returns, we will likely have to leave the Divine-Demonic Battlefield," the Old Turtle said, putting down his cup and smacking his lips.</p><p></p><p>The Old Turtle knew Lord Changsheng's character the best, and once a place's affairs were settled, he would not linger there.</p><p></p><p>Jian Wuhui and the others were stunned by this, but not entirely surprised.</p><p></p><p>They understood deep in their hearts that a peerless figure like Lord Changsheng would not stay long in the Divine-Demonic Battlefield.</p><p></p><p>The boundless void had more than just the Divine-Demonic Battlefield.</p><p></p><p>Thinking about this, Jian Wuhui felt an urge to explore the broader world, but he was tied down here in the Divine-Demonic Battlefield, as it concerned the fate of all the Human Realm in this small corner of the endless void.</p><p></p><p>Moreover, the next Pantheon War would begin in tens of thousands of years, and that would be the true great battle of the Divine-Demonic Battlefield, where everything would be reshuffled.</p><p></p><p>Just as the group fell silent, a figure in blue robes gradually materialized.</p><p></p><p>And the first words spoken were, "Old Turtle, let's go."</p><p></p><p>Here is my translation of the Chinese excerpt:</p><p></p><p>The crowd was startled and quickly stood up to salute: "Master (Lord Changsheng)."</p><p></p><p>"Lord Changsheng, are you leaving the Divine-Demonic Battlefield?" Jian Wuhui asked with some reluctance.</p><p></p><p>He had originally wanted to muster up the courage to ask Changsheng to take him on as a disciple and teach him the sword dao, but he didn't expect it to be so abrupt.</p><p></p><p>"Mm, the matters of the Divine-Demonic Battlefield are now resolved, it's time for me to leave," Lu Changsheng said with a faint smile.</p><p></p><p>Jian Wuhui and the others exchanged glances, took a light breath, and bowed one after another: "We thank Lord Changsheng for his deep love and grace towards the human race."</p><p></p><p>Lu Changsheng gave a slight smile and waved his hand. Jian Wuhui and the others must have misunderstood, his care for the human race was just an incidental matter.</p><p></p><p>The true purpose of his coming to the Divine-Demonic Battlefield was to follow the mysterious pull in his heart. And he already knew what had attracted him here - it was the Great Dao Demon-Subduing Tower.</p><p></p><p>But why would the Great Dao Demon-Subduing Tower attract him? He couldn't quite figure it out. Was there some connection?</p><p></p><p>Lu Changsheng's gaze became slightly unfocused as he looked back through the river of memories, but there was no mention of the Great Dao Demon-Subduing Tower.</p><p></p><p>Just what was it...?</p><p></p><p>Jian Wuhui looked at the blue-robed man in front of him, thinking that he might never see him again, and suddenly found the courage to grit his teeth and say:</p><p></p><p>"Lord Changsheng, could you... could you teach me the sword dao?"</p><p></p><p>He looked at Lu Changsheng expectantly.</p><p></p><p>Until Lu Changsheng's gaze turned to him, meeting his calm, water-like eyes, Jian Wuhui hurriedly lowered his head, his heart tense.</p><p></p><p>"The sword dao is also a minor path for me, just something I played with on a whim, I can't teach you anything," Lu Changsheng said honestly.</p><p></p><p>Huh? Just played with on a whim?</p><p></p><p>Jian Wuhui and the others were dejected.</p><p></p><p>But judging from Lord Changsheng's expression, that really seemed to be the case, and they believed that Changsheng would not make such a joke.</p><p></p><p>Is this what a supreme expert is like? Is this what unparalleled natural talent is like?</p><p></p><p>To be able to reach the peak that others could hardly ever attain with just casual play!</p><p></p><p>"And my sword dao is not suitable for you, I am the Impassive Sword."</p><p></p><p>Lu Changsheng said calmly, then waved his sleeve and disappeared with the old turtle.</p><p></p><p>"Farewell, Lord Changsheng!"</p><p></p><p>Jian Wuhui and the others hurriedly bowed to see him off, and after a moment, they all sighed deeply.</p><p></p><p>Lord Changsheng had come and gone so suddenly, they didn't even have the chance to rally the clan members to send him off in grand fashion.</p><p></p><p>But they realized that Lord Changsheng's quiet departure was also a kind of protection for their human race.</p><p></p><p>"The Impassive Sword..."</p><p></p><p>Jian Wuhui's eyes were bitter as he murmured, "The Impassive Sword is the most cruel and ruthless, and the cultivation conditions are also the most harsh and brutal, no wonder Lord Changsheng didn't teach me..."</p><p></p><p>On the Divine-Demonic Battlefield, Lu Changsheng's departure was known only to the Heavenly Dao and Jian Wuhui and the others, no one else.</p><p></p><p>Only, the top position on the Divine Celestial Ranking had remained vacant ever since then.</p><p></p><p>And the name at the top of the Individual Combat Ranking seemed to be forever unshakable, revered by all races in the Divine-Demonic Battlefield for all eternity!</p>

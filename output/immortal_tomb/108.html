        <h1>Chapter 108</h1>
        <div class="content">
            <p>Here is the full English translation of the Chinese excerpt:</p><p></p><p>The old butler was stunned. "Immortal Celestial Emperor? What is he talking about... how can he not understand?"</p><p></p><p>The several soul messengers were already trembling in fear!</p><p></p><p>Especially the one who had just angrily shouted "What Immortal Celestial Emperor?", he felt a bit dizzy.</p><p></p><p>The name of the Immortal Celestial Emperor, heard again after millions of years!</p><p></p><p>They simply could not understand how the soul body that was about to enter the animal realm could be related to the mighty Immortal Celestial Emperor who transcended the heavens and earth...</p><p></p><p>"Hehe," the soul marshal looked at the dumbfounded old butler and said, "Is the so-called 'Mister' a person who wears green robes and is rather quiet, with a smile that makes one feel as refreshing as spring breeze?"</p><p></p><p>The old butler's eyes lit up as he hurriedly said, "Yes, yes, that's right!"</p><p></p><p>The soul marshal took a deep breath, his gaze slightly dazed. It has been millions of years indeed...</p><p></p><p>He then asked, "Then... did the Immortal, I mean, the Mister, say anything?"</p><p></p><p>"The Mister said that the world after my death is called the Soul Realm, and that he knows the head of this world, and that head will arrange for me..." the old butler said after swallowing.</p><p></p><p>The soul marshal smiled. Indeed, the Immortal Celestial Emperor is still the same as before, and then he laughed, "You don't need to find that head, for I am the supreme ruler of the Soul Realm!"</p><p></p><p>Saying that, he slapped the several kneeling soul messengers, scattering their souls.</p><p></p><p>...</p><p></p><p>In the central region of the Fuyao Immortal Continent, surrounded by city walls, a palace that blocked out the sun floated high in the sky.</p><p></p><p>Countless cultivators and mortals looked up at the palace in awe.</p><p></p><p>It's understandable, for the Patrol Hall can be considered the number one force in the Fuyao Immortal Continent. Not only is the Patrol Hall Master a Immortal King, the Patrol Hall itself is the imperial household's, so who wouldn't be afraid?</p><p></p><p>Today is the rare once-in-ten-thousand-years recruitment day for Patrol Hall Inspectors. Many cultivators are flocking over, as the benefits and treatment of being a Patrol Hall Inspector are quite good, and behind them stands the mighty Patrol Hall!</p><p></p><p>The saying "Leaning on a big tree is cool" applies here.</p><p></p><p>Although the Patrol Hall is an imperial force, Patrol Hall Inspectors do face some risks in carrying out their duties.</p><p></p><p>Therefore, a new batch of fresh blood is recruited every ten thousand years.</p><p></p><p>To become a Patrol Hall Inspector, even the lowest rank of Copper-grade Inspector, is no easy feat.</p><p></p><p>The cultivation base requirement is at least Gold Immortal!</p><p></p><p>This threshold alone has caused countless cultivators to give up.</p><p></p><p>In addition to the highest cultivation requirement, there are also other special requirements, such as having a handsome appearance, a tall and slender figure, and for female Patrol Hall Inspectors, they must also have a voluptuous figure...</p><p></p><p>Although it's unclear why these requirements are set, there must be a reason behind it.</p><p></p><p>At this moment, below the Patrol Hall, countless cultivators were observing the grand ceremony of recruiting new Patrol Hall Inspectors, their eyes filled with envy as they looked at the hundreds of figures standing on the high platform.</p><p></p><p>Yes, those hundreds of figures are the new Patrol Hall Inspectors who have fought their way through. The recruitment ceremony is nearing its end.</p><p></p><p>Next, they will be awarded the black-gold uniform and copper badge that symbolize the Patrol Hall Inspectors, and then they can enter the Patrol Hall above.</p><p></p><p>After the awards were presented, a Silver-grade Patrol Hall Inspector swept his gaze across the new Inspectors and said with a satisfied smile, "Alright! From now on, you will be the pillars of my Patrol Hall. For the glory of the Patrol Hall, hold nothing back in your dedication, do you understand?!"</p><p></p><p>"We understand!" </p><p></p><p>The Inspectors shouted in unison, their faces filled with excitement and their hearts overjoyed.</p><p></p><p>Among these hundreds of new Inspectors, more than half are beautiful female cultivators with excellent bearing and temperament.</p><p></p><p>"Very good, next, the female Patrol Hall Inspectors will follow me to meet the Hall Master. Your first mission after taking office will be announced by the Hall Master himself! Come with me!"</p><p></p><p>The Silver-grade Patrol Hall Inspector smiled meaningfully, then led the excited and flushed-faced female Inspectors towards the main hall.</p><p></p><p>Here is the full English translation of the Chinese excerpt:</p><p></p><p>What an honor this is! She is one of the most prominent figures in the Fuyang Immortal Realm!</p><p></p><p>[New 69 Book Bar]</p><p></p><p>Soon, only a group of perplexed male inspectors remained, whispering among themselves.</p><p></p><p>"What's going on? Why can they carry out missions as soon as they become inspectors, and it's even an order from the Grand Patriarch himself! I'm not satisfied!"</p><p></p><p>"Ah, you don't understand. This is a long-standing rule in the Inspection Hall. The newly appointed female inspectors must undergo a physical examination by the Grand Patriarch."</p><p></p><p>"Ah, a physical examination? Why? Is the Grand Patriarch worried about their health? I don't believe it."</p><p></p><p>"......"</p><p></p><p>As the discussion gradually subsided, the inspectors left the Inspection Hall, and the onlookers also dispersed.</p><p></p><p>Suddenly, a young man in blue robes appeared.</p><p></p><p>Lu Changsheng looked up at the Inspection Hall, his expression indifferent, and then vanished like sand.</p><p></p><p>The Inspection Hall.</p><p>The Heavenly Prison.</p><p></p><p>In the vast Heavenly Prison, it was cold and quiet, only the sound of clashing chains echoing.</p><p></p><p>Two silver-ranked inspectors on guard were drinking outside. One of them, hearing a noise, sneered, "What a stubborn one, still not submitting."</p><p></p><p>"Ah, you shouldn't say that. After all, he's the Chaos Immortal Lord. That's a Immortal Lord, haha!"</p><p></p><p>The other inspector glanced inside and deliberately mocked in a loud voice, "Haha, you little fellow."</p><p></p><p>The two of them felt quite satisfied. After all, a Chaos Immortal Lord, if he were outside, might not even spare a glance at the likes of them, Great Celestial Immortals.</p><p></p><p>Now that the tiger has fallen to the plains, they can finally have their way.</p><p></p><p>"But why hasn't the Immortal King killed him yet? He's been imprisoned for hundreds of thousands of years, I really don't understand."</p><p></p><p>"Careful with your words! How dare you question the Immortal King's actions!"</p><p></p><p>The other inspector, realizing he had spoken out of turn, turned pale and fell silent.</p><p></p><p>At the same time, in the deepest part of the Heavenly Prison, a young man with disheveled white hair, his limbs bound and his body covered in blood, was staring blankly.</p><p></p><p>He looked at the young man in blue robes and hoarsely asked, "Dao... Dao companion, who are you?"</p><p></p><p>Lu Changsheng's eyes flashed with a blue light as he lightly chuckled, "No wonder the Inspection Hall has imprisoned you for so long without killing you. It turns out you possess a precious treasure, and this treasure has fused with you. Without your consent, they can't obtain it."</p><p></p><p>The white-haired youth's pupils suddenly contracted!</p><p></p><p>"I suppose it's thanks to this treasure that you were able to ascend from the Mortal Realm and become a Chaos Immortal." Lu Changsheng continued.</p><p></p><p>The white-haired youth's scalp tingled, and he stared at the young man in blue with a wary expression.</p><p></p><p>How did this young man know so much? And why did he feel somewhat familiar, as if he had seen him before, but he just couldn't remember?</p><p></p><p>Could it be that too much time had passed?</p><p></p><p>The next moment, Lu Changsheng waved his hand.</p><p></p><p>Clang, clang, clang...!</p><p></p><p>The chains binding the white-haired youth broke and fell to the ground.</p><p></p><p>"This... !" The white-haired youth's eyes were filled with shock. Those chains had imprisoned him for hundreds of thousands of years, and they were just broken like that. This young man in blue must be extremely powerful. But why would he want to save him...?</p><p></p><p>"Who's there?!" A shout from the inspectors outside suddenly rang out, obviously alerted by the sound of the falling chains.</p><p></p><p>"Let's go," Lu Changsheng said indifferently, turning to leave.</p><p></p><p>The white-haired youth, in a panic, said, "Senior, this place is heavily guarded, and there's the Immortal King... You..."</p><p></p><p>Lu Changsheng seemed to ignore him, continuing to walk away as he casually remarked, "The Immortal King? What is that?"</p>

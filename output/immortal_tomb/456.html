        <h1>Chapter 456</h1>
        <div class="content">
            <p>Here is the full English translation of the Chinese excerpt:</p><p></p><p>After leaving the Cangwu Pavilion, Ye Nantian summoned two elders and hurriedly headed towards the Offering Hall.</p><p></p><p>Outside the Offering Hall, Ye Nantian waved his hand and called out, "Ye Feng!"</p><p></p><p>Ye Feng was startled and quickly came over, cupping his hands in salute. "Clan Leader, Second Elder, Third Elder."</p><p></p><p>"Hehe, Ye Feng, is Elder Lu inside the Offering Hall?" Ye Nantian glanced at the Offering Hall and asked with a smile.</p><p></p><p>"Yes, Clan Leader, the Elder is inside the Offering Hall," Ye Feng replied respectfully.</p><p></p><p>"Good, Ye Feng, go and ask Elder Lu if he is willing to accompany us to the Hong Clan," Ye Nantian said hurriedly.</p><p></p><p>The Hong Clan?!</p><p></p><p>Ye Feng's pupils shrank. In the Hollow Ancient Realm, anyone who suddenly heard the name of a super ancient clan would be shaken.</p><p></p><p>"Yes, Clan Leader, I will go right away." Ye Feng cupped his hands in salute and quickly headed towards the Offering Hall.</p><p></p><p>The Second Elder looked at Ye Feng's retreating figure and smiled, "Clan Leader, are you hoping for Elder Lu to make an appearance before the various ancient clans?"</p><p></p><p>Ye Nantian chuckled sheepishly, "It was not my idea, but the Pavilion Master's. The Pavilion Master asked me to inquire about Elder Lu's willingness, but if Elder Lu does not wish to go, it's fine, it's up to him."</p><p></p><p>After a moment, just as Ye Nantian thought that Elder Lu was unwilling to go and was about to lead the two elders to leave,</p><p></p><p>Elder Lu walked out of the Offering Hall.</p><p></p><p>Ye Nantian exclaimed joyfully, "Elder Lu, are you going as well?"</p><p></p><p>"Going to take a look won't hurt, after all, I'm not short on time," Elder Lu said with a smile.</p><p></p><p>"Haha, good, then let us depart for the Hong Clan immediately!" Ye Nantian said happily.</p><p></p><p>The Second Elder and Third Elder also snapped back to their senses and hurriedly paid their respects, "Greetings, Elder Lu!"</p><p></p><p>"Mm."</p><p></p><p>...</p><p></p><p>In the dark space, four figures were leisurely traversing, which were Luo Changsheng and the three from Ye Nantian's group.</p><p></p><p>"Elder Lu, our current destination is the Hong Clan, and the Hong Clan is a super ancient clan, you see..." Ye Nantian took the opportunity to explain the purpose of their trip, lest Elder Lu be unaware.</p><p></p><p>"Oh? A super ancient clan, is it very powerful?" Luo Changsheng asked indifferently.</p><p></p><p>The Second Elder and Third Elder awkwardly pursed their lips. Of course, a super ancient clan would be extremely powerful.</p><p></p><p>"That's right, it's extremely powerful. Elder Lu, being new to this, may not know, but in the entire Hollow Ancient Realm, there are only three super ancient clans!" Ye Nantian said with a solemn expression.</p><p></p><p>Luo Changsheng's eyes flashed slightly. "Then which are the other two super ancient clans?"</p><p></p><p>Ye Nantian saw that Luo Changsheng's expression was calm and unruffled, and he felt helpless, thinking that Luo Changsheng simply did not yet understand the terrifying nature of the super ancient clans.</p><p></p><p>Moreover, in Ye Nantian's eyes, Luo Changsheng's own strength was indeed very powerful, having reached the peak of the Spiritual Void Realm, which was already among the top experts in the Hollow Ancient Realm. Having a sense of pride was normal.</p><p></p><p>"The other two super ancient clans are the He Clan and the Ouyang Clan..." Ye Nantian introduced.</p><p></p><p>The He Clan...</p><p></p><p>Luo Changsheng nodded slightly.</p><p></p><p>"Elder Lu, regarding the He Clan... in fact, the He Clan is the main reason for our visit to the Hong Clan this time!" Ye Nantian's tone suddenly became grave, and the two elders also became serious.</p><p></p><p>Luo Changsheng had already known the general situation, but he only nodded without saying much.</p><p></p><p>Seeing this, Ye Nantian solemnly said, "Elder Lu, I presume you have heard of the Myriad World Calamity Body?"</p><p></p><p>"I have heard of it," Luo Changsheng nodded slightly.</p><p></p><p>"Ah, the He Clan has somehow suddenly produced a Myriad World Calamity Body, they say it was brought from somewhere else, but that's not the main point of this incident. The Myriad World Calamity Body was born in the He Clan, which is a blessing for the He Clan, but we other ancient clans can only watch helplessly..."</p><p></p><p>Here is the full English translation of the Chinese excerpt:</p><p></p><p>"The wood has already become a boat, and there's no way around it, but the problem is......"</p><p></p><p>Ye Nan continued with some indignation, "But the problem is that what clan actually wants to refine the Eternal Calamity Body! I'm sure Elder Lu, with his strength and experience, must know that refining the Eternal Calamity Body will cause irreversible damage to the foundations of the Ancient Void Realm, and even the entire Qian-Kun Heavens!"</p><p></p><p>The expressions of the Second Elder and Third Elder beside him were also extremely grim.</p><p></p><p>Who can guarantee what the consequences of refining the Eternal Calamity Body will be?</p><p></p><p>If it leads to the depletion of the spiritual essence in the heavens and earth, then future breakthroughs will become much more difficult.</p><p></p><p>It's even highly possible that breaking through to the Divine Void will become extremely difficult.</p><p></p><p>Lu Changsheng nodded indifferently, "Mm, if you put it that way, the problem does seem quite serious."</p><p></p><p>Ye Nantian had originally wanted to nod in empathy, but when he saw Lu Changsheng's carefree expression, he couldn't help but feel suspicious.</p><p></p><p>Ye Nantian wanted to ask: Elder Lu, why don't I see any trace of nervousness on your face?</p><p></p><p>"Elder Lu, you must know that this matter is extremely complex. I had thought that all the ancient clans in the Ancient Void Realm would unite to resist the clan that wants to refine it, after all, it concerns the interests of everyone. But I don't know what bewitching methods the clan used, they've actually gained the support of many ancient clans!"</p><p></p><p>"And among them, there is even one of the three super ancient clans - the Ouyang Clan!!!"</p><p></p><p>Ye Nantian's expression was extremely grave and perplexed.</p><p></p><p>Unexpectedly, upon hearing this, Lu Changsheng not only did not have a solemn expression, but instead asked with interest:</p><p></p><p>"Two super ancient clans, then don't you all have no chance of winning? Could it be that I just became your clan's patron, and your clan is about to step into a dead end?"</p><p></p><p>Uh...</p><p></p><p>Ye Nantian and the other Elders looked at each other, then Ye Nantian softly said:</p><p></p><p>"Elder Lu, don't worry, when that time comes, just take care of yourself."</p><p></p><p>Lu Changsheng turned his head and said a sentence that Ye Nantian and the others couldn't understand, "Don't worry, it won't come to that."</p><p></p><p>Ye Nantian thought Lu Changsheng was comforting him, so he just smiled. Suddenly, he remembered something: "Oh right, Elder Lu, weren't you here in the Ancient Void Realm to handle some private matters? Have we delayed you?"</p><p></p><p>Lu Changsheng was silent for a moment, then faintly said, "It's not in conflict."</p><p></p><p>Huh?</p><p></p><p>Ye Nantian and the three were once again thrown into confusion.</p><p></p><p>Just as Ye Nantian was about to open his mouth to ask something, his expression changed: "The Hong Clan has arrived!"</p><p></p><p>The next moment, Ye Nantian tore open the dark spatial barrier in front of them, and endless bright light flooded in like a tidal wave!</p><p></p><p>Immediately after, Lu Changsheng followed Ye Nantian and the others as they stepped out of the space.</p><p></p><p>.........</p><p></p><p>In the vast sky above, there were endless palaces floating, a magnificent sight.</p><p></p><p>But in the eyes of the onlookers, this was the holy palace of the Hong Clan, one of the three super ancient clans!</p><p></p><p>Lu Changsheng looked ahead and joked, "It's indeed worthy of being a super ancient clan, more majestic than the Ye Clan."</p><p></p><p>"Hehe, of course, what else did you expect? They are called a super ancient clan for a reason," Ye Nantian sighed with admiration.</p><p></p><p>Lu Changsheng glanced at Ye Nantian and nodded slightly.</p><p></p><p>At this time, streams of light were constantly flowing out of the space and heading towards the direction of the Hong Clan.</p><p></p><p>Ye Nan said, "Elder Lu, these should all be ancient clans summoned by the Hong Clan. Let's hurry and enter the Hong Clan as well?"</p><p></p><p>Lu Changsheng: "Okay."</p>

        <h1>Chapter 489</h1>
        <div class="content">
            <p>Here is the full English translation of the Chinese excerpt:</p><p></p><p>This incredibly casual move shocked the entire audience!</p><p></p><p>After the initial shock, the expressions on the faces of the Kuang Shi Association President and the others resembled those of survivors. </p><p></p><p>They never expected that such a powerful cultivator would come to the island.</p><p></p><p>At the same time, the Kuang Shi Association President and the others were puzzled, unable to understand why the man in the blue robe would intervene and help their two factions.</p><p></p><p>The eyes of the Big Faction Master and the Second Faction Master of the Three Tigers Gang had already constricted deeply, filled with intense apprehension.</p><p></p><p>Among the three of them, the Third Faction Master was the weakest, but he was by no means weak.</p><p></p><p>After all, the Third Faction Master had reached the Three Transformations Spiritual Void Realm.</p><p></p><p>The Three Transformations Spiritual Void meant that he had mastered the Dao to the third level.</p><p></p><p>The mastery of the Dao was divided into nine levels, and the hall master-level figures of their three factions were at the Second Transformation Spiritual Void Realm, corresponding to the second level of Dao mastery.</p><p></p><p>In the ancient Void Realm, cultivators like Ouyang Mo and Hong Wanjun at the Spiritual Void Realm had just barely grasped the Dao, only at the first level.</p><p></p><p>As for the Kuang Shi Association President, the Mang Xiang Sect Master, and the Big Faction Master of the Three Tigers Gang, they were powerhouses at the fourth level of the Spiritual Void Realm!</p><p></p><p>...</p><p></p><p>The Big Faction Master asked himself sincerely, the casual move of the man in the blue robe just now had truly shocked him!</p><p></p><p>The Big Faction Master took a deep breath and forced a ugly smile on his face, cupping his hands and saying, "Fellow Daoist, our gang master deeply apologizes for disturbing your meal. How about this, come visit our Three Tigers Gang afterward, and I will definitely treat you well!"</p><p></p><p>At this critical juncture, the Big Faction Master did not want any unexpected complications! He was just about to annihilate the Kuang Shi Association and the Mang Xiang Sect.</p><p></p><p>Seeing the Big Faction Master of the Three Tigers Gang submitting, the people around were shocked once again!</p><p></p><p>"Hand over your Third Faction Master to me for punishment, and the conflict of today ends here. I'm not asking for your opinion, understand?" Lu Changsheng said indifferently with his hands behind his back.</p><p></p><p>Hearing this, the Third Faction Master who was clutching his shoulder changed his expression and gritted his teeth, shouting, "You...you're being too unreasonable! Big Brother..."</p><p></p><p>He then looked at the Big Faction Master.</p><p></p><p>The Big Faction Master's expression darkened. "Fellow Daoist, our gang master has already apologized for disturbing your meal, but you are being so overbearing. Isn't that a bit too much?"</p><p></p><p>There was no way he would hand over his third brother! Although they were not blood-related, they had been working together for years!</p><p></p><p>And most importantly, he would not let the Kuang Shi Association and the Mang Xiang Sect off the hook today!!</p><p></p><p>"So what if I'm being unreasonable? Kneel down!" Lu Changsheng's eyes turned cold as he commanded in a low voice.</p><p></p><p>Boom!!!</p><p></p><p>At his words, an overwhelming pressure suddenly descended upon the three faction masters of the Three Tigers Gang!</p><p></p><p>Bang! Bang! Bang!</p><p></p><p>The three faction masters' expressions changed drastically, and the next moment, they were kneeling on the ground!!</p><p></p><p>"Sssâ€”"</p><p></p><p>The people present shuddered, their minds greatly shaken!</p><p></p><p>How powerful! How domineering!!</p><p></p><p>Who was this man in the blue robe? They had never heard of him before!</p><p></p><p>The members of the two major factions were dumbfounded, and the Kuang Shi Association President hurriedly led all his members to bow down.</p><p></p><p>"Great One, I, the Three Tigers Gang, submit to your judgment! And we will obey your order and no longer conflict with the Kuang Shi Association and the Mang Xiang Sect. We were blind and did not recognize the true dragon. Please, Great One, forgive us!"</p><p></p><p>At this time, the trembling roar of the Big Faction Master echoed throughout Eternal Night City.</p><p></p><p>Although they had anticipated the outcome, the ship captain and the others still trembled as they watched this scene, their gazes filled with deep reverence towards the man in the blue robe standing with his hands behind his back.</p><p></p><p>This was the awe-inspiring power of an absolute expert!</p><p></p><p>Seeing the three major factions all kneeling, the cultivators both inside and outside Eternal Night City also knelt down towards the man in the blue robe, as if worshiping a king.</p><p></p><p>Behind Lu Changsheng, the old turtle looked enviously at this scene, his heart itching. If he could only be worshipped by the masses as well, that would be so wonderful.</p><p></p><p>Under the influence of various factors, the old turtle's desire to become stronger grew even more intense.</p><p></p><p>The Third Faction Master was now trembling like a sieve, thinking, "Super steel plate, super steel plate!!" </p><p></p><p>He was certain that he was doomed.</p><p></p><p>"Big Brother, save me..."</p><p></p><p>"Third Brother, just go. I really... can't save you..."</p><p></p><p>The Third Faction Master's face turned deathly pale.</p><p></p><p>...</p><p></p><p>Three days later, with the sound of the ship's horn, the Sea Transport No. 3 slowly departed from Eternal Night Island, heading towards its next destination, Ascension Island, which was the place to comprehend the Dao in the Dao Sea.</p><p></p><p>As for the three factions on Eternal Night Island, they had retreated and the Three Tigers Gang's Third Faction Master had perished. </p><p></p><p>As for the other members of the Three Tigers Gang, Lu Changsheng did not target them further, and the Three Tigers Gang had already offended the Sea Transport merchants.</p><p></p><p>Here is the full English translation of the Chinese excerpt:</p><p></p><p>Yes, the future is also difficult to escape destruction, it is just a matter of living a little longer.</p><p></p><p>The fierce lion and the reckless elephant tried their best to persuade Lu Changsheng, but were all politely rejected by him.</p><p></p><p>Yeyeye Island was just a small episode, and it has come to an end.</p><p></p><p>.........</p><p></p><p>The Sea Transport No. 3 sailed against the wind and waves, and after leaving the waters of Yeyeye Island, the sky instantly changed from darkness to brightness. The scorching sun was shining.</p><p></p><p>Although it had only been three days, this sunlight made the captain and the others feel like it had been a long time.</p><p></p><p>"Everyone, the next stop is the final destination of this journey. After comprehending the laws, are you planning to return or settle in the Sea of Laws?"</p><p></p><p>"I plan to settle in the Sea of Laws. Even if I want to go back, I can't afford the boat ticket..."</p><p></p><p>"Yes, I'll also settle in the Sea of Laws. The land doesn't have as much potential as the Sea of Laws."</p><p></p><p>On the deck, the cultivators were chatting idly.</p><p></p><p>Almost all the cultivators decided to settle in the Sea of Laws, for two reasons.</p><p></p><p>One, the Sea of Laws has more potential, and two, they really can't afford the return boat ticket.</p><p></p><p>Previously, when they encountered the sea demonic cultivators, they had thrown all their treasures into the sea due to their pettiness.</p><p></p><p>"By the way, what is the process of comprehending the laws on Tianting Island?"</p><p></p><p>Suddenly someone asked curiously.</p><p></p><p>Hearing this, the cultivators frowned, as they had no idea.</p><p></p><p>"Hehe, of course there is a process." </p><p></p><p>At this time, the captain came to the deck, smiling.</p><p></p><p>"Captain!"</p><p></p><p>The cultivators quickly stood up to greet him.</p><p></p><p>"Everyone, sit down. It will take a hundred years to reach Tianting Island, so I'll take this opportunity to introduce it to you."</p><p></p><p>The captain sat down cross-legged and said with a smile.</p><p></p><p>The cultivators' eyes lit up, and they gathered around him.</p><p></p><p>The captain calmed himself and said as the first sentence: "Don't say anything else, but when you arrive at Tianting Island, you must be very careful and cautious, and don't do anything reckless, or your lives will be in danger."</p><p></p><p>The cultivators' expressions changed, and one of them blurted out the question on everyone's mind: "Captain, isn't Tianting Island just a place to comprehend the laws? Could it be even more dangerous than Yeyeye Island?"</p><p></p><p>"Haha!" The captain sneered, "What is Yeyeye Island? Let me tell you, as the only hub for comprehending the laws in the Sea of Laws, Tianting Island, whether in terms of island size or importance, is not comparable to even a thousand, or even ten thousand Yeyeye Islands!"</p><p></p><p>"That's why, on Tianting Island, there are countless complex forces entrenched, some of which are the true peak forces of the Sea of Laws!"</p><p></p><p>The cultivators' pupils shrank in shock!</p><p></p><p>"Hehe, that's why I warn you to be very careful and cautious. After all, you have no backing, and the slightest mistake could lead to your complete destruction," the captain said earnestly.</p><p></p><p>The cultivators nodded and gave the captain grateful looks.</p><p></p><p>The captain was a good captain, and it was not easy to be cared for by others when out on a journey.</p><p></p><p>"As for comprehending the laws, it's not that simple either. The process is quite complicated, and you'll have to wait in line... And let me tell you one more thing, don't have any illusions about being able to comprehend excellent laws on Tianting Island. If you can comprehend average laws, that would already be a successful journey!"</p><p></p><p>The captain sighed.</p><p></p><p>Why?</p><p></p><p>The cultivators frowned deeply, their expressions puzzled.</p><p></p><p>Didn't they come to the Sea of Laws precisely to comprehend better laws? Now the captain was telling them not to have any fantasies?</p><p></p><p>The captain shook his head and said, "The better comprehension sites on Tianting Island have been monopolized by some major forces, so that's why I say this. But don't be discouraged, I'm just trying to lower your expectations, because the Sea of Laws is the Sea of Laws, and comprehending the laws is far more difficult than on the land."</p><p></p><p>"And it's not that the better comprehension sites will definitely allow you to comprehend better laws. It's just that the chances are slightly higher, but it still depends on your own talent and fate."</p><p></p><p>Although the captain said this, the cultivators could only smile wryly.</p><p></p><p>It seems they were too naive. Since Tianting Island is so important, there must be some hidden secrets.</p><p></p><p>Seeing the cultivators fall silent, the captain shook his head and returned to the cabin.</p><p></p><p>A hundred years later.</p><p></p><p>"Wooooooâ€”â€”"</p><p></p><p>When the ship's horn sounded, everyone's spirits were lifted as they rushed to the railing, looking excitedly at the huge island in the distance.</p><p></p><p>The final destination of this journey, Tianting Island, had arrived!</p><p></p><p>.........</p><p></p><p>For the fastest updates of the flawless novel, please visit www.feixs.com</p><p></p><p>For mobile access, please visit: https://m.feixs.com/chapter-45751-38225608</p>

        <h1>Chapter 115</h1>
        <div class="content">
            <p>Here is the full English translation of the Chinese excerpt:</p><p></p><p>Upon hearing this, Nangong Jing felt somewhat melancholic. üëπüíóÔºñ‚ûàùìº‚íΩœÖùîÅ.ùìíùì∏‡πìüòù‡µ†</p><p></p><p>That's right, this matter should be asked of the Immortal Emperor Changsheng. But what could the Immortal Emperor Changsheng do about it?</p><p></p><p>The elders of the Heavenly Mechanism Pavilion also wore gloomy expressions. Although this group of Heavenly Mechanism Masters were at the Immortal King realm, their strength was slightly inferior to ordinary Immortal Kings.</p><p></p><p>Let them calculate the heavenly mechanisms, that's still fine, but fighting is not their forte.</p><p></p><p>Moreover, if the Underworld Demon Tribe is truly as terrifying as the Pavilion Master and the Immortal Emperor Changsheng have said, then it would be truly dreadful.</p><p></p><p>"You don't need to worry too much, there will be a way to solve this. Before that, you should still inform those four fellows about this matter," Luchang Sheng said softly.</p><p></p><p>Nangong Jing looked at Luchang Sheng and respectfully asked, "Immortal Emperor, would you like to rest in our Heavenly Mechanism Pavilion for a while?"</p><p></p><p>Luchang Sheng thought for a moment and said, "Alright, I will stay in your Heavenly Mechanism Pavilion for some time and wait."</p><p></p><p>Hearing this, Nangong Jing let out a slight sigh of relief.</p><p></p><p>The Immortal Emperor Changsheng cannot disappear again. If he disappears again, this great calamity in the Immortal Realm would have no chance of success, and total defeat would be inevitable.</p><p></p><p>Nangong Jing was about to speak when a Heavenly Mechanism elder suddenly stood up and said, "Pavilion Master, the child outside has delivered a message, saying that people from the Immortal Emperor Palace have arrived..."</p><p></p><p>The Heavenly Mechanism elder's voice grew softer, and he glanced at the expressionless Luchang Sheng.</p><p></p><p>The others also lowered their heads and pursed their lips. As Heavenly Mechanism Masters, they were quite intelligent, and the sudden arrival of the Immortal Emperor Palace at their Heavenly Mechanism Pavilion.</p><p></p><p>Anyone could guess that it was because of the matter of the frozen Inspection Pavilion in Feiyang Immortal Realm, which was dealt with by the Immortal Emperor Changsheng.</p><p></p><p>Nangong Jing looked at Luchang Sheng, feeling a bit awkward. "Immortal Emperor..."</p><p></p><p>Luchang Sheng sat on the seat, closed his eyes, and said, "You may go."</p><p></p><p>"Yes, Nangong takes his leave." </p><p></p><p>Nangong Jing's eyes flickered, and he led the Heavenly Mechanism elders to bow and then retreated.</p><p></p><p>"What are you still doing here?"</p><p></p><p>Luchang Sheng turned his head and asked.</p><p></p><p>The old turtle's heart trembled, and he smiled awkwardly while scratching his head, "Hehe, the old turtle is going to guard the door..."</p><p></p><p>He then scurried out.</p><p></p><p>...</p><p></p><p>In the ancient and simple Heavenly Mechanism Palace, three high-ranking members of the Immortal Emperor Palace were seated. Two were middle-aged, and one was a young man. They all wore gray-white robes with golden embroidered "Immortal Emperor Palace" on their chests.</p><p></p><p>"Where are your elders? Why haven't they come out yet?" </p><p></p><p>The young man, who seemed to be the leader, frowned and asked.</p><p></p><p>As a high-ranking member of the Immortal Emperor Palace, Li Hua was a mighty Immortal King-level expert. If it weren't for the order from the Yin-Yang Immortal Emperor to be polite to the Heavenly Mechanism Pavilion, especially to give face to the Pavilion Master, he would have already lost his temper.</p><p></p><p>"Please wait, Senior Li Hua. The elders are on their way," the servant said calmly.</p><p></p><p>Li Hua frowned slightly, about to say something, when ten figures materialized in the Heavenly Mechanism Palace - the ten Heavenly Mechanism elders.</p><p></p><p>Li Hua and the other two were slightly surprised and exchanged glances. They didn't expect all ten Heavenly Mechanism elders to come out...</p><p></p><p>The irritation they had felt from the long wait gradually subsided.</p><p></p><p>After all, they felt that the Heavenly Mechanism Pavilion valued them enough.</p><p></p><p>Outwardly, they still maintained a decent appearance and didn't make a fuss.</p><p></p><p>"Haha, what an honor, I wonder what brings Senior Li Hua from the Immortal Emperor Palace to our Heavenly Mechanism Pavilion?" </p><p></p><p>Kong Nanchen, the leader of the Heavenly Mechanism elders, cupped his hands and asked with a smile.</p><p></p><p>Remembering the words of the Yin-Yang Immortal Emperor, Li Hua did not put on airs and smiled, "Elder Kong, with your Heavenly Mechanism Pavilion's abilities, you should know the reason for my visit..."</p><p></p><p>Kong Nanchen's eyes flickered, and he spoke directly.</p><p></p><p>Here is the full English translation of the excerpt from the Chinese novel:</p><p></p><p>The Daoist said, "If Lord Li Hua has come to ask our Heavenly Mechanism Pavilion to divine the matters regarding the Inspection Pavilion, then please take your leave."</p><p></p><p>Huh?!</p><p></p><p>Li Hua's pupils suddenly constricted, and he exchanged a surprised glance with the other two Immortal Kings.</p><p></p><p>"Elder Kong, what do you mean by this?" Li Hua swept his gaze across the other nine Pavilion Elders, then fixed his eyes directly on Kong Nanchen, patiently asking.</p><p></p><p>He needed an explanation.</p><p></p><p>Kong Nanchen did not beat around the bush, but directly stated, "There is no hidden meaning. I am simply giving you a friendly reminder that the forces behind the Inspection Pavilion are not something you in the Immortal Emperor Palace can trifle with, even the Yin-Yang Immortal Emperor himself must show them respect, that is all."</p><p></p><p>Having said that, Kong Nanchen did not say any more, feeling that he had already made himself clear enough.</p><p></p><p>The three of Li Hua were shocked!</p><p></p><p>At their level, they were naturally not people without brains, and the Heavenly Mechanism Pavilion would not say anything unfounded.</p><p></p><p>Li Hua asked in a solemn voice, "In this four-direction Immortal Realm, who could destroy the Inspection Pavilion and make the Yin-Yang Immortal Emperor show them respect? Aside from the Long-Life Immortal Emperor who has been missing for a million years, who else?"</p><p></p><p>Kong Nanchen was taken aback for a moment, slightly nodding his head. This Li Hua was not too stupid after all, he had already thought of the Long-Life Immortal Emperor.</p><p></p><p>But the next moment,</p><p></p><p>"But it absolutely cannot be the Long-Life Immortal Emperor!!"</p><p></p><p>Li Hua stated firmly and resoundingly.</p><p></p><p>"Huh?"</p><p></p><p>Kong Nanchen and the group of Heavenly Mechanism Pavilion Elders were dumbfounded.</p><p></p><p>Well, they thought this Li Hua was not stupid, but it turned out he first excluded the correct answer.</p><p></p><p>"The Long-Life Immortal Emperor has not been seen for a million years, how could he suddenly appear? Even if the Long-Life Immortal Emperor really returned, how could he possibly make a move against the Inspection Pavilion established by the Yin-Yang Immortal Emperor in the Fuyao Immortal Realm? I was once fortunate enough to drink with the Yin-Yang Immortal Emperor, and I heard him say that his relationship with the Long-Life Immortal Emperor was quite good!"</p><p></p><p>"So it cannot be the Long-Life Immortal Emperor!"</p><p></p><p>Li Hua waved his sleeve, analyzing it eloquently.</p><p></p><p>Kong Nanchen was stunned for a moment, and according to Li Hua's analysis, it did seem quite reasonable.</p><p></p><p>"In any case, I have said what I needed to say, Lord Li Hua, please take your leave."</p><p></p><p>Kong Nanchen sighed lightly.</p><p></p><p>"You must tell me today, who is it?!" Li Hua growled, already somewhat impatient.</p><p></p><p>It's true that they should give face to the Heavenly Mechanism Pavilion, but once the line is crossed, they won't give face anymore!</p><p></p><p>They're used to being catered to.</p><p></p><p>Kong Nanchen was a bit speechless, wasn't his hint just now clear enough? </p><p></p><p>It's you who's being stupid, and now you're asking me?</p><p></p><p>Without knowing the Long-Life Immortal Emperor's intentions, he dared not blurt out L√º Changsheng.</p><p></p><p>"Lord Li Hua, please take your leave, the Heavenly Secrets cannot be revealed."</p><p></p><p>Kong Nanchen casually made up an excuse and prepared to leave, not wanting to say more.</p><p></p><p>Li Hua became angry: "You Heavenly Mechanism Pavilion won't even drink the penalty wine!"</p><p></p><p>Everyone's bodies suddenly stiffened, their expressions turning gloomy!!</p><p></p><p>"I call you Lord Li Hua, and you still have the audacity? Even the Yin-Yang Immortal Emperor has to show our Pavilion Master some respect, what are you, Li Hua?"</p><p></p><p>Kong Nanchen angrily shouted with a red face and thick neck.</p><p></p><p>Li Hua was dumbfounded, pointing at himself and saying, "Did you just say what am I?"</p><p></p><p>"Say it again if you dare!! Today, if I don't destroy your Heavenly Mechanism Pavilion, I'm not surnamed Li!"</p><p></p><p>Kong Nanchen's expression changed slightly, angrily retorting, "You..."</p><p></p><p>Before he could finish his words, another figure appeared in the Heavenly Mechanism Pavilion.</p><p></p><p>It was Nangong Jing.</p><p></p><p>His gaze beneath the black veil seemed to be staring straight at Li Hua, indifferently saying, "Destroy the Heavenly Mechanism Pavilion? Such audacious words, what a big mouth you have!"</p><p></p><p>As the words fell,</p><p></p><p>The plain robe moved without wind, the aura of the Immortal Venerable pressing down on the three from the Immortal Emperor Palace like a tangible force.</p>

        <h1>Chapter 519</h1>
        <div class="content">
            <p>Here is the full English translation of the Chinese excerpt:</p><p></p><p>"Man's nature at the beginning is fundamentally good, and people's natures are similar, but habits make them distant. If not taught..."Eh, what comes next again?</p><p></p><p>In the simple and unadorned schoolhouse, a small dark-skinned boy stood there, scratching his head, his little face full of embarrassment, his eyes darting around unwilling to look towards the podium.</p><p></p><p>"Haha, the little black donkey is so stupid!"</p><p></p><p>"Haha, little black donkey, if you can't recite it again, the teacher will definitely hit you with the ruler!"</p><p></p><p>"Oh dear, little black donkey, you're so ugly and stupid!"</p><p></p><p>"..."</p><p></p><p>In the schoolhouse, fifteen young boys and girls were giggling and laughing.</p><p></p><p>"Ahem."</p><p></p><p>Suddenly, a light cough came from the podium.</p><p></p><p>The schoolhouse immediately fell silent, all the students quickly quieted down, sitting up straight, exceptionally obedient.</p><p></p><p>Although their gaze was fixed on the books in front of them, their peripheral vision was carefully glancing towards the podium.</p><p></p><p>There, on the podium, sat a young and handsome gentleman in blue robes, his eyes calm, with a faint smile at the corners of his mouth.</p><p></p><p>"T-teacher, Han Yue forgot."</p><p></p><p>The little boy Han Yue said timidly.</p><p></p><p>Lu Changsheng nodded slightly, then picked up the ruler and waved it.</p><p></p><p>Han Yue, who had already anticipated this, immediately understood, walked out of his seat, came to the podium, and tremblingly extended his palm...</p><p></p><p>It wasn't the first time he had been hit, the teacher's ruler hurt a lot, especially painful.</p><p></p><p>"What are you coming up here for?" </p><p></p><p>Lu Changsheng asked puzzledly.</p><p></p><p>Huh? Han Yue looked up, gazing blankly at Lu Changsheng.</p><p></p><p>"Go back to your seat." Lu Changsheng swept his gaze across the other students in the classroom, softly saying, "Those of you who just mocked Han Yue, come up here and line up to be hit with the ruler."</p><p></p><p>As soon as the words fell, the young boys and girls in the classroom were alarmed, their faces turning pale, but they didn't dare say anything, leaving their seats and lining up.</p><p></p><p>Han Yue was delighted, he bowed towards Lu Changsheng and returned to his seat, propping up his chin and trying his best to look calm.</p><p></p><p>"This isn't the first time, you know."</p><p></p><p>Slap!</p><p></p><p>"So you haven't really learned the Three Character Classic?"</p><p></p><p>Slap!</p><p></p><p>"Never mock others, you're not that much better than them."</p><p></p><p>Slap!</p><p></p><p>"You should learn to appreciate others' strengths and make up for your own shortcomings, then you will become better and better, instead of just mindlessly mocking."</p><p></p><p>Slap!</p><p></p><p>"You only see Han Yue's flaws, but do you know that he has to help his parents with chores after school before he can find time to study?"</p><p></p><p>Slap!</p><p></p><p>"Even if you don't help Han Yue, at least refrain from mocking him, that would also be a kind act."</p><p></p><p>Slap!</p><p></p><p>"As classmates, you should help and support each other, don't exclude or look down on one another, understand?"</p><p></p><p>Lu Changsheng put away the ruler and said calmly.</p><p></p><p>After a moment of silence.</p><p></p><p>"We understand, teacher..."</p><p></p><p>The students said with their heads bowed, then one by one sincerely apologized to Han Yue.</p><p></p><p>"Han Yue, we won't call you 'little black donkey' anymore, don't take our past words to heart."</p><p></p><p>"Han Yue, after school, can I go to your house and help you with the chores?"</p><p></p><p>"Me too, me too!"</p><p></p><p>"..."</p><p></p><p>Han Yue's nose felt a little sore, he could only nod dumbly, glancing at the gentleman in blue robes on the podium, feeling a sense of being understood warming his heart.</p><p></p><p>How could the teacher know so clearly about his situation...</p><p></p><p>It had barely been half a month since the start of the term, the teacher hadn't even visited their homes yet.</p><p></p><p>"Alright, everyone go back to your seats and continue studying. As long as you have the first part of the Three Character Classic memorized and understand its meaning, I'll tell you all a story afterwards, how about that?"</p><p></p><p>On the podium, Lu Changsheng smiled faintly.</p><p></p><p>"Okay!!"</p><p></p><p>The students quickly returned to their seats, picking up their books and pens, diligently studying.</p><p></p><p>Lu Changsheng nodded slightly: "And by the way, get ready, I'll be doing home visits in half a month."</p><p></p><p>Hearing this, the students became nervous and studied even more earnestly.</p><p></p><p>Lu Changsheng gently nodded, then leaned back, closed his eyes to rest, the contented smile never leaving the corners of his mouth.</p><p></p><p>This was exactly what he wanted.</p><p></p><p>Here is the full English translation of the Chinese excerpt:</p><p></p><p>Life, what's the point of always fighting and killing? He was tired of it.</p><p></p><p>Although he was now a complete being, far more powerful than his previous true self.</p><p></p><p>But he had no use for such power. To be honest, even the strength of his previous true self would have been enough.</p><p></p><p>...</p><p></p><p>The sun was setting in the west.</p><p></p><p>"Goodbye, sir!"</p><p></p><p>In front of the Changsheng Academy, the students bid farewell to Lu Changsheng after the lesson, hurriedly running off with their book bags, giggling and playful, drawing many sidelong glances and subtle admiration.</p><p></p><p>However, most of the passersby soon fixed their gaze on Lu Changsheng, silently showing him respect and admiration.</p><p></p><p>A few months ago, the Changsheng Academy had appeared in their prosperous town as if descended from the heavens. It officially began recruiting students a month ago and opened a half-month ago.</p><p></p><p>The opening of a private academy was not particularly surprising.</p><p></p><p>But the problem was, at the academy's opening ceremony, the town mayor and all the clan leaders had personally come to show their support and congratulate the opening - a grand occasion that had shocked the entire town!</p><p></p><p>At the time, it had alarmed the other academies. They had planned to suppress the new academy, but now they had hastily abandoned their schemes.</p><p></p><p>With the promotion and endorsement of the town lord and clan leaders, all the parents in the town had flocked to enroll their children in the Changsheng Academy. Even parents from the surrounding small villages had brought their children to sign up.</p><p></p><p>But how strange - the Changsheng Academy only accepted fifteen students! And it was not based on tuition fees or family background, but on some kind of affinity...</p><p></p><p>Unbelievable! Even the young master of the town lord's family had been rejected. Everyone finally believed it.</p><p></p><p>Moreover, the town lord seemed afraid to say anything to the gentleman in blue, and instead scolded his own son for being a waste, embarrassing the family.</p><p></p><p>Thereupon, no one dared to say anything. Those who were not selected just left dejectedly with their children.</p><p></p><p>On the other hand, the other academies in the town heaved a sigh of relief - at least the Changsheng Academy only took in fifteen students, if it had no limit, their own livelihoods would have been ruined.</p><p></p><p>"Mr. Lu."</p><p>"Hello, Mr. Lu."</p><p></p><p>Passersby greeted Lu Changsheng one after another.</p><p></p><p>"Hello everyone," Lu Changsheng replied with a smile, then closed the academy's door and strolled down the street.</p><p></p><p>All the people he encountered along the way politely greeted him. Although they did not know what capabilities this gentleman in blue possessed, nor were they familiar with him, the terrifying network of relationships behind him was enough to make them treat him with the utmost respect.</p><p></p><p>Lu Changsheng entered a noodle shop called Old Xu's Noodle Shop. At the moment, there was no one in the shop. He casually found a seat and called out, "Old Xu."</p><p></p><p>Sounds came from the kitchen, and an old man quickly pulled back the curtain and walked out, rubbing the flour off his hands and smiling, "Ah, Mr. Lu has come!"</p><p></p><p>"The usual," Lu Changsheng said with a smile.</p><p></p><p>Old Xu sighed bitterly, "Mr. Lu, you've been eating the scallion noodles for a whole month now. How about trying a different flavor today?"</p><p></p><p>Lu Changsheng smiled and said, "Just the scallion noodles. Even though I've been eating them for a month, I still haven't tasted the full flavor yet."</p><p></p><p>Hadn't tasted the full flavor yet?? </p><p></p><p>Old Xu was taken aback. As expected of a teacher, his words were so profound that Old Xu couldn't understand at all!</p><p></p><p>...</p><p></p><p>PS: The fantasy setting is of course fictional, and the "Three Character Classic" is just a quote.</p><p></p><p>The author will try their best to update twice a day, and appreciates any encouragement through free "love electricity".

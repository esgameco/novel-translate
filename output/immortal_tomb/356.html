        <h1>Chapter 356</h1>
        <div class="content">
            <p>Here is the full English translation of the Chinese excerpt:</p><p></p><p>Time has passed another three months. ‚úåüë£ÔºñÔºôÀ¢ùìó«óùìß.·∂ú·óùŒúüíõüç≠</p><p></p><p>Outside the human realm, the battlefield of gods and demons is constantly shrouded in a thick, dark mist, with no sight of the sky.</p><p></p><p>But within the human realm, the skies are clear and bright. Suddenly, a sharp voice resounds through the celestial city, echoing across the human realm:</p><p></p><p>"Three days from now, the nine divine mystics participating in the Seven-Colored Crystal Tower shall gather outside the human city!"</p><p></p><p>It is the voice of the Sword Sovereign!</p><p></p><p>Three days from now... the battle for the Crystal Heart is about to begin!</p><p></p><p>The human realm is stirred into commotion!</p><p></p><p>Whether they are participating in the Seven-Colored Crystal Tower or not, they all rush towards the human city through the teleportation arrays.</p><p></p><p>But the majority still travel on their own, for the teleportation arrays cannot possibly accommodate the massive influx of people.</p><p></p><p>.........</p><p></p><p>The three-day period passes in the blink of an eye.</p><p></p><p>Today, outside the human city, countless figures have gathered - some were already in the human city, while others have hurried from various regions of the human realm.</p><p></p><p>As far as the eye can see, the crowd is dense and innumerable, an awe-inspiring sight.</p><p></p><p>Roughly estimated, there are far more than a billion people.</p><p></p><p>If not for the limited space, there would be even more.</p><p></p><p>At this moment, everyone remains silent and composed, quietly awaiting the arrival of the human lord and the esteemed divine mystics.</p><p></p><p>Today, they have come to see off the two human lords and the divine mystics.</p><p></p><p>The battle for the Seven-Colored Crystal Tower concerns the entire clan, and the very honor of the entire race!</p><p></p><p>Among the vast sea of people, even the five elders of the Peng Clan and Lin Dong of the Tong Xin Clan are present.</p><p></p><p>Hearing of this grand event, they naturally took the time to come and witness the spectacle.</p><p></p><p>Most importantly, they have heard that one of the three spots for the human city is occupied by Lu Changsheng...</p><p></p><p>They have a feeling that it must be their carefree sect master...</p><p></p><p>"Elders, fellow disciples, do you think that could be our sect master?" Tong Xin excitedly scans the grand scene, transmitting his thoughts.</p><p></p><p>The Peng Clan elders exchange a puzzled glance, having already realized it, wondering why Tong Xin is so slow to catch on.</p><p></p><p>"Fellow disciple, it must be our sect master without a doubt. How else could there be so many coincidences?" Lin Dong transmits.</p><p></p><p>"I can't believe the sect master is at the Divine Mystic Realm... No wonder he is so formidable." Tong Xin reverently sighs.</p><p></p><p>Having been in the human realm for some time, they have gathered quite a bit of information.</p><p></p><p>After all, in the entire human realm of hundreds of millions of cultivators, there are only about a hundred or so at the Divine Mystic Realm!</p><p></p><p>How incredibly powerful!</p><p></p><p>Peng Fang's eye twitches as he says, "Holy son, while the Divine Mystic Realm is indeed formidable and difficult for us to contend with, do you truly believe the sect master is merely at the Divine Mystic Realm?"</p><p></p><p>The others nod in agreement, their expressions reverent. Indeed, they cannot bring themselves to believe that the sect master is only at the Divine Mystic Realm.</p><p></p><p>Throughout, the sect master has been like an unfathomable abyss. Whenever they thought they had grasped the limits of his power, he would quickly surprise and shock them again.</p><p></p><p>It is as if he is always stronger than expected, revealing only the tip of the iceberg each time.</p><p></p><p>By now, they have long since learned not to take the sect master's surface abilities at face value.</p><p></p><p>If they could see through the sect master, he would no longer be their sect master.</p><p></p><p>"Hehe, you're right." Tong Xin scratches his head awkwardly, feeling a bit ashamed.</p><p></p><p>Even though he has followed the sect master for longer, he is still not as perceptive as the senior elders.</p><p></p><p>"Elder, in the entire human realm, there are only about a hundred or so at the Divine Mystic Realm. Just how powerful is the Divine Mystic Realm?" Lin Dong asks.</p><p></p><p>Here is the full English translation of the Chinese excerpt:</p><p></p><p>The doubts in their hearts were resolved.</p><p></p><p>Peng Fang, Zuo Choushan, and the others looked at each other, wondering just how powerful the Mystic Realm realm was.</p><p></p><p>Although they had progressed extremely quickly, they had only reached the Divine Vault realm. How could they possibly know the immense strength of the Mystic Realm realm that lay beyond the Divine Dao realm?</p><p></p><p>Peng Fang stated with certainty, "A single finger could probably shatter our Xiaoyao Sect into pieces, right?"</p><p></p><p>Sss!</p><p></p><p>Tong Xin and Lin Dong supported each other, sharply inhaling in shock. This was truly startling.</p><p></p><p>"Cough, cough, of course, this elder hasn't counted the Sect Master. If the Sect Master was included, that Mystic Realm realm cultivator would probably be blown apart by a single finger from the Sect Master!" Peng Fang quickly added.</p><p></p><p>Swoosh swoosh swoosh!</p><p></p><p>At this moment, five majestic figures appeared in the sky almost simultaneously!</p><p></p><p>On the left were Mang Tian and Jiang Wuxin.</p><p>On the right were Han Jinlong and Yan Jueyi.</p><p>In the center was the scholar-robed Jian Wuhui.</p><p></p><p>Instantly, an unparalleled aura shrouded the sky, and howling winds whipped up the remaining clouds!</p><p></p><p>Outside the city, the countless cultivators trembled in their gazes, kneeling in unison and shouting with all their might:</p><p></p><p>"We pay our respects to the Five Lords!"</p><p></p><p>Peng Fang and the others also couldn't help but kneel down with the crowd, this being the first time they had bowed to anyone other than their own Sect Master.</p><p></p><p>The moment the five majestic figures appeared in the sky, for some reason, the blood in their bodies began to surge wildly.</p><p></p><p>Of course, it was the same for everyone present here. </p><p>This was the pull of the human race's bloodline, the oppressive force of the superiors over the inferiors.</p><p></p><p>In the sky,</p><p>Jian Wuhui first glanced at the city below, then looked down, waving his sleeve and smiling:</p><p></p><p>"Rise."</p><p></p><p>Instantly, a gentle force lifted the cultivators, who numbered in the hundreds of millions, from the ground!</p><p>Jian Wuhui's cultivation was truly profound, worthy of being the foremost among the Five Lords!</p><p></p><p>After rising, the cultivators enthusiastically gazed up at the Five Lords above.</p><p>From this angle, they could see the three grand rankings shining brilliantly behind the Five Lords!</p><p></p><p>On the Individual Combat Power Ranking, the 95th place was occupied by the human race's Jian Wuhui.</p><p></p><p>At this moment, the space shimmered again, and 113 figures materialized below the Five Lords, the weakest of whom were in the Mystic Realm realm, and the strongest being the three in the lead, who were in the early Divine Seclusion realm.</p><p></p><p>Figures like Mo Lianqiu, Shui Tinghen, Zhao Di, and Miu Fan, who were on the City Battle Ranking, stood solemnly among the Mystic Realm cultivators.</p><p></p><p>Thus, all of the human race's top combat powers had gathered outside the city.</p><p>This sight filled the watching cultivators with surging blood, exclaiming in delight.</p><p></p><p>They could name every single one of these peak experts of the human race!</p><p></p><p>At this time, Jian Wuhui slightly inclined his head.</p><p></p><p>Jiang Wuxin stepped forward, bowing slightly, and spoke in a clear voice:</p><p></p><p>"The nine participants in the Seven-Colored Crystal Tower, step forward!"</p><p></p><p>The next moment, eight figures moved out from the hundred-person formation, appearing before the Five Lords and bowing respectfully.</p><p></p><p>Huh?</p><p></p><p>Everyone present was taken aback, looking at each other in confusion. There was one missing.</p><p></p><p>Mo Lianqiu, Shui Tinghen, Zhao Di, and the others knew that Lu Changsheng was a bit flustered.</p><p>They never imagined that their friend Lu would be so bold as to dare be late on such an important occasion - they themselves wouldn't have the courage to do that, even if they had a thousand lives.</p><p></p><p>Inadvertently, they began to admire him a little.</p><p></p><p>Han Jinlong and Yan Jueyi exchanged a glance, then stepped forward slightly, bowing awkwardly towards Jian Wuhui:</p><p></p><p>"Lord Jian, Lu Xiaoyou must have been delayed by some matter. I shall go find him."</p><p></p><p>To everyone's astonishment, Jian Wuhui waved his hand and said:</p><p></p><p>"No need, we shall wait for him."</p>

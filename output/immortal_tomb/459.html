        <h1>Chapter 459</h1>
        <div class="content">
            <p>Here is the full English translation of the Chinese excerpt:</p><p></p><p>Two and a half months, even for ordinary people it would have flashed by, let alone for cultivators.</p><p></p><p>In the first two months, the Ye Clan and other top ancient clans, following Hongwu Jue's intentions, quickly integrated many middle-ranking ancient clans, though the ones integrated were mainly the strong members and high-level figures of the middle-ranking clans.</p><p></p><p>As for the lower-ranking ancient clans, although Hongwu Jue had mentioned them as well, in the eyes of the Ye Clan and other top clan leaders, there was no need, as their strength was completely inadequate, only adding to the casualties.</p><p></p><p>Currently, there is only half a month left.</p><p></p><p>Imperceptibly, the Donghsu Ancient Realm had fallen into complete silence, as if a great storm was brewing.</p><p></p><p>And the actions of the Hong Clan and Ye Clan and other top ancient clans naturally did not escape the notice of the He Clan.</p><p></p><p>It's just that it's unknown whether the He Clan doesn't care or is preoccupied with preparing for the Myriad World Calamity, as they haven't taken any targeted actions.</p><p></p><p>...</p><p></p><p>In another part of the Donghsu Ancient Realm, in the sky, a continuous series of buildings floated, with countless streams of light of different colors spiraling along the buildings, their grand momentum even vaguely surpassing that of the Hong Clan.</p><p></p><p>At this time, all the members of the He Clan were going about their own tasks in an orderly manner, quiet, extremely quiet, the entire He Clan was exceptionally quiet.</p><p></p><p>Until nightfall, one of the tallest buildings in the He Clan suddenly erupted with a bright light, the spreading light patterns attracting the attention of all the He Clan disciples.</p><p></p><p>However, the He Clan disciples were used to this, as the Celestial Tower had been making such movements every night during this period.</p><p></p><p>So they just glanced at it and then turned their gaze back to continue what they were doing.</p><p></p><p>At the same time, on the top of the so-called Celestial Tower, there were a group of figures standing, but no one was speaking, all of them holding their breath and watching the scene before them.</p><p></p><p>At this moment, on the ground before them, a huge light ring was flickering, and the dazzling light just now must have burst out from this light ring.</p><p></p><p>Within the light ring, a black-robed figure was making hand seals, looking up at the night sky with focused attention, the obscure talismanic symbols flickering in his eyes under the black robe.</p><p></p><p>After a moment, the black-robed figure suddenly released the hand gesture, closed his eyes and let out a long sigh.</p><p></p><p>The moment he released his hand gesture, the huge light ring on the ground around him also gradually dimmed.</p><p></p><p>Beside him, the others saw this and stirred slightly.</p><p></p><p>The leading old woman stepped forward and asked, "Star Master, how is it?"</p><p></p><p>The black-robed man looked up and said, "Clan Leader He, there is no need to wait until half a month later, three days from now is also an excellent time to refine the Myriad World Calamity Body."</p><p></p><p>"Good." The old woman's eyes flashed.</p><p></p><p>This old woman was the current Clan Leader of the He Clan, He Lian.</p><p></p><p>Beside her, the He Clan elders also let out a sigh of relief upon hearing this, finally able to refine the Myriad World Calamity Body.</p><p></p><p>It's better to refine it earlier, as they had been dragging it on, and it was really troubling them in their hearts, after all, this matter offends the Heavenly Dao...</p><p></p><p>He Lian pondered for a moment, then ordered, "Since the time has been moved forward, all elders quickly go down and prepare, take the clan disciples with you, and be sure to set up the Celestial Shielding Formation in the last two days!"</p><p></p><p>"Yes, Clan Leader!" </p><p></p><p>The group of He Clan elders quickly responded and then bowed and withdrew.</p><p></p><p>He Lian stepped to the edge of the Celestial Tower, overlooking the entire clan.</p><p></p><p>At this time, the entire He Clan could be seen faintly covered by countless red lines, but there were still many gaps, not yet fully formed.</p><p></p><p>"Star Master, can this Celestial Shielding Formation really shield the Heavenly Dao?" </p><p></p><p>He Lian's eyes flickered.</p><p></p><p>The black-robed man called the Star Master walked to He Lian's side and said confidently, "Clan Leader He, rest assured, the Donghsu Ancient Realm is an independent spatial world, and with this Celestial Shielding Formation, the Heavenly Dao will certainly not be able to detect the process of refining the Myriad World Calamity Body."</p><p></p><p>He Lian took a deep breath, turned her head to look at the black-robed man, and asked worriedly, "Then..."</p><p></p><p>Here is the full English translation of the Chinese excerpt:</p><p></p><p>After the refinement... Once the grand formation of the Heavenly Dao is exhausted, it will ultimately be detected by the Heavenly Dao."</p><p></p><p>"Hehe, Elder He need not worry too much. As long as the process of refining the Myriad Worlds Calamity Body is safely navigated, as for when the Heavenly Dao detects it, I have my own methods."  The black-robed figure's eyes beneath the hood stared in the direction of the Ye Clan, his gaze flickering as he spoke.</p><p></p><p>He Lian's heart was filled with alarm. She turned her head back, her peripheral vision catching a glimpse of the inscrutable black-robed figure, her mind in turmoil.</p><p></p><p>He Lian constantly felt that she had completely fallen into the black-robed figure's trap.</p><p></p><p>She racked her brain but could not figure out the true purpose of the black-robed figure.</p><p></p><p>From the moment she brought back the Myriad Worlds Calamity Body, things seemed to have taken a turn for the worse.</p><p></p><p>This mysterious black-robed figure appeared after the Myriad Worlds Calamity Body, directly stating that he had a way to break through the boundaries and take the He Clan to new heights.</p><p></p><p>As the clan leader of a super ancient clan, He Lian naturally would not believe a one-sided claim.</p><p></p><p>But!</p><p></p><p>This black-robed figure who calls himself a Star Master is truly unfathomable!!</p><p></p><p>Any secret that only He Lian herself knew, the black-robed figure could blurt out, as familiar as the back of his hand, completely shocking He Lian.</p><p></p><p>And that was just in the past. The black-robed figure even possessed the terrifying ability to predict the future, which He Lian had witnessed with her own eyes!</p><p></p><p>So later on, while feeling wary and fearful, a sense of ambition also began to stir in He Lian's heart.</p><p></p><p>And thus came the scene of today, where the black-robed figure said that the maturation of the Myriad Worlds Calamity Body was not the limit, and that only by refining it could the true Myriad Worlds Calamity Body be achieved!</p><p></p><p>He Lian immediately became alert. Refine? Who would refine it?</p><p></p><p>But when the black-robed figure said it would be done by the people of the He Clan, He Lian finally let down her guard.</p><p></p><p>But now, He Lian regretted it, feeling that she had fallen into an endless trap.</p><p></p><p>Yet it was too late. Although she appeared to be on good terms with the black-robed figure, in her heart she was filled with deep distrust and even fear!!</p><p></p><p>He Lian was afraid that if she refused, the black-robed figure could turn on her in an instant.</p><p></p><p>"Elder He!"</p><p></p><p>Suddenly, the black-robed figure's voice rose.</p><p></p><p>He Lian's heart trembled, and she forced herself to appear calm as she replied, "Star Master, please speak."</p><p></p><p>The black-robed figure clasped his hands behind his back and said indifferently, "In this refinement of the Myriad Worlds Calamity Body, the Heavenly Dao is only secondary, the one we should be most wary of is another..."</p><p></p><p>The Heavenly Dao is secondary, another? </p><p></p><p>He Lian's mouth fell open, looking at the black-robed figure with a bewildered gaze, although she could not see the face hidden in the shadowy hood.</p><p></p><p>"Star Master, I do not understand your meaning..." He Lian hesitated.</p><p></p><p>Clearly, the black-robed figure's words had gone beyond her imagination.</p><p></p><p>"You will know soon enough, I won't tell you, because... even if I tell you, you won't be able to do anything about it."</p><p></p><p>The black-robed figure finished speaking and turned to leave, effectively dismissing her.</p><p></p><p>He Lian's face couldn't help but turn pale. She opened her mouth, wanting to say something but unable to. The black-robed figure's words had clearly stirred up a storm in her heart, and her regret only deepened.</p><p></p><p>"Then the Star Master may rest."</p><p></p><p>He Lian forced herself to suppress the trembling in her heart and quickly left the Celestial Pavilion.</p><p></p><p>After He Lian left, the black-robed figure turned back, looking towards the pitch-black night sky in the direction of the Ye Clan, his eyes beneath the hood flickering.</p><p></p><p>At the same time, in the Ye Clan's Shrine of Offerings.</p><p></p><p>Lu Changsheng also withdrew his gaze from an unknown place, then by the light of the night stone, he picked up the score again, reading it with great interest.</p><p></p><p>Only a slight curve appeared at the corner of Lu Changsheng's mouth.</p><p></p><p>It seems things have become more interesting...</p>

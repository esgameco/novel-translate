        <h1>Chapter 364</h1>
        <div class="content">
            <p>Here is the full English translation of the excerpt from the Chinese novel:</p><p></p><p>As time passed by, ‚ô®‚ôñ‚ûÖ‚ùæ‚ì¢ùî•√πùìç.ƒÜ‚ìûùïÑüò≤üò≥</p><p></p><p>The races that ranked among the top 100 or top 50 all caused a stir.</p><p></p><p>After all, these were extremely powerful races, existing as the dominant forces in the Divine-Demonic Battlefield.</p><p></p><p>By this point, more and more foreign races had gathered around the Colorful Jade Tower, with the exception of the top 10 super clans, who had basically all arrived.</p><p></p><p>The foreign races remained silent, not daring to express any discontent.</p><p></p><p>Even the large clans ranked in the top 100 or top 50 did not dare to act strangely.</p><p></p><p>After all, the top 10 clans on the Myriad Races Ranking were truly supreme, and not to be provoked!</p><p></p><p>At this moment, </p><p>there were dozens of foreign race teams staring at the human race team with bloodthirsty eyes!!</p><p></p><p>Everyone noticed this and looked at the human race with pity.</p><p></p><p>These dozens of foreign race teams were no simple matter...</p><p>The weakest were still ranked in the hundreds on the Myriad Races Ranking, and the strongest... even had a team that was approaching the top 100 foreign races!</p><p></p><p>It was unimaginable how much pressure such a large number of high-quality foreign races could exert on the human race.</p><p></p><p>If it weren't for the Annihilation Sword Sovereign and the other four human race masters in the front, the human race would have been annihilated long ago.</p><p></p><p>However, if this continued, the human race would eventually be destroyed.</p><p></p><p>How long could the Annihilation Sword Sovereign hold out?</p><p></p><p>As for the human race side,</p><p>Jiang Wuxin and Han Jinlong closed their eyes, pretending not to see, maintaining a calm expression, but their hearts were heavy and angry.</p><p>They just didn't show it.</p><p></p><p>As for Fang Yun and the others, their expressions were unsightly, their anger written plainly on their faces, unable to conceal it.</p><p>It wasn't that they couldn't control it, but rather that they couldn't hold it in!</p><p>These races targeting them, each one, they could call out their race names!</p><p></p><p>Lu Changsheng felt the gazes around him, some mocking, some enjoying the show, some pitiful, some sinister, with all kinds of attitudes.</p><p>He pondered for a moment, then transmitted a message to Jiang Wuxin and Han Jinlong:</p><p>"Why do these races have enmity with the human race? What is the reason?"</p><p></p><p>The closed-eyed Jiang Wuxin and Han Jinlong furrowed their brows.</p><p>After a moment of silence, Jiang Wuxin transmitted a message with a helpless tone: "Changsheng friend, you don't know, the enmity between these foreign races and our human race... has been very, very long, even to the point where the origins are untraceable."</p><p></p><p>Han Jinlong transmitted: "Although the time is long, in my view, it still seems somewhat inexplicable. All along, our human race has been well-behaved, even in the midst of conflicts, we've always left a way out, as if we've never truly offended anyone."</p><p></p><p>Jiang Wuxin and Han Jinlong were quite helpless, the entanglement was difficult to explain clearly.</p><p>But how did it come to this?</p><p>It was as if it was a resentment of annihilation.</p><p></p><p>Lu Changsheng suddenly had an epiphany and transmitted a message with a smile:</p><p>"The one inside knows not, the one outside knows. To solve the human race's... it's likely not these foreign races. I suspect there is a hand behind these foreign races pushing them..."</p><p></p><p>Lu Changsheng's words were somewhat veiled, but Jiang Wuxin and Han Jinlong's expressions changed abruptly, and they quickly opened their eyes.</p><p>This...</p><p>Thinking about it carefully, Changsheng's words were not without reason!</p><p>If it was truly as Changsheng said, then it would be quite horrifying!</p><p>Jiang Wuxin and Han Jinlong's hearts grew increasingly cold the more they thought about it.</p><p>Which clan could it be...?</p><p></p><p>Just then, ten auras appeared!!</p><p>All the races trembled in their gazes, hastily looking in all directions!</p><p>In every direction, there were dazzling flashes of light, and terrifying auras sweeping in from afar!</p><p>The peak great clans had finally arrived!</p><p>Swoosh swoosh swoosh swoosh...!</p><p></p><p>New 69 book bar 89sh</p><p></p><p>Here is the full English translation of the Chinese excerpt:</p><p></p><p>The next moment, ten squadrons suddenly appeared in this place!</p><p></p><p>Immediately, all the alien tribes dared not to breathe, lowering their proud heads!</p><p></p><p>The Heavenly God Tribe, humanoid, barefoot, levitating, with white light wings fluttering behind their backs, a faint divine mark on their foreheads, emanating a sacred aura!</p><p></p><p>The Devouring Beast Tribe, in beast form, with black fur as hard as needles, a huge tail swinging behind them, looking extremely awe-inspiring!</p><p></p><p>The Dragon Tribe, in humanoid form, with horns on their foreheads, the difference being the varying horn sizes, and Ao Xing's horns were the largest, and golden!</p><p></p><p>The Phoenix Tribe, predominantly female, dressed in fiery red robes, a scorching sensation assailing one's senses.</p><p></p><p>Next came the White Tiger Tribe, the Xuanwu Tribe, the Soul-Devouring Tribe, the Lion-Eagle Tribe, the Heavenly Crow Tribe, and the Water Demon Tribe!</p><p></p><p>The ten peak apex tribes each had their distinct characteristics, easily distinguishable!</p><p></p><p>Except for the Heavenly God Tribe and others being humanoid, the Devouring Beast Tribe, the Soul-Devouring Tribe, and the Water Demon Tribe appeared in their original forms.</p><p></p><p>The Soul-Devouring Tribe was hidden in the black mist, with only a dense mass of tentacles writhing outside.</p><p></p><p>The Water Demon Tribe was entirely emerald green, like water ghosts, with disheveled hair and extremely sharp, long fangs, and more importantly, their entire bodies were damp and even oozing pus, emanating a foul stench.</p><p></p><p>They could be considered the most disgusting and unique tribe among the ten peak apex races.</p><p></p><p>"Shenlo, I, the Holy Son, know that it is you, the Divine Son, leading the team this time," Ao Xing said with a smile as he looked towards the Heavenly God Tribe camp.</p><p></p><p>Upon hearing this, the leaders of the other eight peak apex tribes all looked towards the tribe in the central position, the Heavenly God Tribe!</p><p></p><p>The Heavenly God Tribe, ranked first on the Myriad Tribes Ranking!</p><p></p><p>Also, the most sacred-looking tribe from the outside on the Demon-God Battlefield!</p><p></p><p>Each member of the Heavenly God Tribe seemed to be a born ruler, sacred and inviolable!</p><p></p><p>At this moment, just as they had imagined,</p><p></p><p>The Heavenly God Tribe members, each and every one, held their heads high, with an arrogant and superior demeanor!</p><p></p><p>The leader was the Holy Son of the Heavenly God Tribe, Shenlo!</p><p></p><p>Shenlo looked at Ao Xing, and the arrogance in his eyes had diminished a bit, indifferently saying, "Ao Xing, it's been a while. I wonder how your Primal Dragon Body has grown?"</p><p></p><p>Ao Xing shook his head and said, "My Primal Dragon Body, of course, cannot compare to your Primordial God Body."</p><p></p><p>The place was deathly silent, and all the tribes were standing with their ears perked up, listening to the conversation between Ao Xing and Shenlo.</p><p></p><p>Hearing about the Primordial God Body, everyone was filled with a sour feeling.</p><p></p><p>Some of the alien tribes even couldn't help but look up at the God Body Ranking in the sky, painfully gazing at the first place...</p><p></p><p>Rank 1: Primordial God Body, Divine Son Shenlo of the God Tribe!</p><p></p><p>"Ao Xing, you're just being too humble. Your Primal Dragon Body is not inferior to the Primordial God Body at all!" </p><p></p><p>At this time, the leader of the Devouring Beast Tribe swung his huge tail behind him and laughed.</p><p></p><p>His terrifying beast form combined with his human speech was extremely captivating.</p><p></p><p>Ao Xing smiled but did not speak.</p><p></p><p>"Biqiong, your Devouring Body is ranked second on the God Body Ranking. How does it compare to the Divine Son's Primordial God Body?" </p><p></p><p>The leading woman of the Phoenix Tribe asked with a flickering gaze and a smile.</p><p></p><p>Biqiong immediately let out a hearty laugh: "Of course, my Devouring Body is stronger than his Primordial God Body! The rankings on the God Body Ranking don't count for anything!"</p><p></p><p>His words did not give Shenlo any face at all.</p><p></p><p>Shenlo's brows furrowed slightly, and he coldly looked at Biqiong, then turned to the Holy Maiden of the Phoenix Tribe: "Fengju, may I assume that you are trying to incite discord?"</p><p></p><p>Fengju's eyes flickered, and she slightly bowed, chuckling softly: "The Divine Son has misunderstood."</p><p></p><p>"What, did I say something wrong? Shenlo, dare you fight me in front of all the tribes?" </p><p></p><p>Biqiong immediately looked at Shenlo with fiery eyes and growled.</p>

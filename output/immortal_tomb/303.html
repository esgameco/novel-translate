        <h1>Chapter 303</h1>
        <div class="content">
            <p>Here is the full English translation of the Chinese excerpt:</p><p></p><p>Eshuan was stunned, a trace of disdain appearing in his eyes. </p><p></p><p>"How dare a mid-stage Deity Sun cultivator talk about defeating me, a late-stage Deity Sun cultivator? Even a body cultivator wouldn't be able to do that!"</p><p></p><p>This bald-headed cultivator had already reached the Deity Sun realm, so how high could his body cultivation be refined?</p><p></p><p>Dual cultivation of spiritual energy and physical body could not possibly be refined to such a high level.</p><p></p><p>Eshuan let out a cold laugh, his toes lightly touching the ground as he levitated, his hands suddenly spreading wide!</p><p></p><p>A towering blood veil formed behind him, contrasting with the three suns, looking extremely ominous.</p><p></p><p>Although he felt disdainful in his heart, he would not underestimate his opponent, for he had seen many cases of overconfidence leading to failure.</p><p></p><p>"This... this is the Bloody Soul Technique of the Blood Demon Sect! It's rumored that cultivating this requires refining the blood of countless demonic beasts..."</p><p></p><p>"But, why do I feel that the blood veil behind Eshuan doesn't seem to be demonic beast blood? It looks more like human blood?"</p><p></p><p>"Tsk... if it's human blood, how many people would he have had to refine?"</p><p></p><p>The celestial emperors discussed in hushed tones, their expressions filled with fear and trepidation.</p><p></p><p>However, the audience was slightly silent, for they were familiar with the Bloody Soul Technique of the Blood Demon Sect.</p><p></p><p>It was just that the towering blood veil behind Eshuan made them somewhat uncomfortable.</p><p></p><p>"Hehe, don't worry, my fellow cultivators. I guarantee that the ones Eshuan has refined for this Bloody Soul Technique are all deserving of death," the Blood Demon Sect Master said with a faint smile.</p><p></p><p>The crowd secretly sneered, thinking that only a fool would believe him, but they naturally wouldn't say anything - it was a case of the strong devouring the weak.</p><p></p><p>...</p><p></p><p>"Hehe, the blood of a Deity Sun realm celestial emperor should be able to make this blood veil even stronger," Eshuan licked his lips, his bloodthirsty nature showing.</p><p></p><p>Immediately, his eyes flashed, and the blood veil began to churn, the thick scent of blood sweeping over the crowd.</p><p></p><p>The blood veil suddenly divided, forming nine giant snakes, which then arched their bodies and hissed as they charged towards the approaching Li Shuo-yan.</p><p></p><p>Compared to the nine blood snakes, Li Shuo-yan looked like a tiny grasshopper, causing the onlookers to watch with grave expressions.</p><p></p><p>Eshuan let out a cruel laugh: "Come, give me some nourishment!"</p><p></p><p>Li Shuo-yan remained silent, his body ablaze with flames, like a shooting meteor.</p><p></p><p>Slowly clenching his right fist, his body trembled, and his speed soared even higher!</p><p></p><p>Soon, under the tense gaze of the crowd, Li Shuo-yan finally collided with the nine giant snakes!</p><p></p><p>The giant snakes had just opened their cavernous mouths when Li Shuo-yan's eyes burned with intensity, and he punched forward!</p><p></p><p>Boom!</p><p></p><p>Eshuan's face changed drastically!</p><p></p><p>...</p><p></p><p>The spectators present all had their pupils constrict as they abruptly stood up.</p><p></p><p>Because Eshuan's nine blood snakes had actually been shattered by Li Shuo-yan's single punch.</p><p></p><p>Piercing through nine!</p><p></p><p>How was this possible?</p><p></p><p>This was completely different from what they had imagined. That was a technique of a late-stage Deity Sun cultivator, yet a mid-stage Deity Sun cultivator had managed it. Was it just through physical body cultivation alone? Could body cultivation truly be so terrifying?</p><p></p><p>And at this moment,</p><p></p><p>Li Shuo-yan's movements did not stop, as he charged straight towards Eshuan!</p><p></p><p>Eshuan's expression was one of disbelief. His heart had already started to waver after their previous clash, as the Bloody Soul Technique could be considered one of his trump cards, yet it had been so arrogantly broken by this mid-stage Deity Sun cultivator!</p><p></p><p>Seeing the approaching Li Shuo-yan, Eshuan finally became completely serious.</p><p></p><p>His body trembled, and the three suns behind him began to spin rapidly, as an even more powerful...</p><p></p><p>Here is the full English translation of the Chinese excerpt:</p><p></p><p>The terrifying scorching heat surged across the plaza!</p><p></p><p>New 69 Book Bar 99shux.com</p><p></p><p>"I admit you have some strength, but today I'll let you know that there is an insurmountable chasm between a single sun and three suns!" </p><p></p><p>The Evil Exterminator coldly shouted, forming a hand seal in front of his chest, "Solar Technique, Three Blazing Suns!"</p><p></p><p>Boom!</p><p></p><p>Three blazing suns suddenly detached from his body, spiraling towards Li Shuo-yan. In an instant, the sky cracked and the earth shattered, as endless scorching waves swept across the plaza!</p><p></p><p>This scene was just like the one when the Elder Ouyang of the Shocking Cloud City unleashed the Solar Technique.</p><p></p><p>However, the two suns summoned by Elder Ouyang were far inferior to the three suns of the Evil Exterminator!</p><p></p><p>The crowd was stunned, the celestial champions looking on with fear and envy at the three blazing suns.</p><p></p><p>The Solar Technique, Three Blazing Suns... This could be considered a specialized technique of the late-stage Solar Realm.</p><p></p><p>It could be said that if no one stopped these three suns, they would have caused severe destruction in the Ancient Wasteland Capital.</p><p></p><p>Of course, with so many powerful figures gathered here, those top-tier forces would be able to block it.</p><p></p><p>Just then,</p><p></p><p>Li Shuo-yan's body paused, as he sensed the violent and destructive power within the three blazing suns.</p><p></p><p>Without hesitation, he decisively activated the Myriad Forged Flame Technique!</p><p></p><p>The moment he activated it, his entire body's flames suddenly extinguished, and to everyone's astonishment, Li Shuo-yan's skin began cracking inch by inch, his body growing larger!</p><p></p><p>From the cracking skin, lava-like light flickered, appearing utterly bizarre.</p><p></p><p>At this moment, Li Shuo-yan no longer resembled his former self at all, but rather a molten lava behemoth!</p><p></p><p>"This power..."</p><p></p><p>Li Shuo-yan slowly clenched his fist, feeling the seemingly inexhaustible strength coursing through his body, filled with fascination.</p><p></p><p>In the next instant, he abruptly looked up at the Evil Exterminator and flashed forward!</p><p></p><p>He charged straight into the three blazing suns without any evasion!</p><p></p><p>Boom!</p><p></p><p>The next moment, an earsplitting explosion reverberated!</p><p></p><p>The three blazing suns were forcefully shattered by Li Shuo-yan's physical body!</p><p></p><p>The crowd's scalps tingled, staring in disbelief at this scene.</p><p></p><p>Everything before their eyes was not the slightest bit of spiritual power, but only the pure aesthetics of violence!</p><p></p><p>"Ugh! You... you!" </p><p></p><p>The Evil Exterminator was struck by the backlash, his aura withering. He finally lost his composure, looking at the approaching Li Shuo-yan, who resembled a supreme demonic beast, with terror in his heart!</p><p></p><p>Under such a terrifying momentum, he hunched over, retreating while shouting:</p><p></p><p>"What are you going to do!"</p><p></p><p>Li Shuo-yan ignored him, his scarlet eyes fixated on the Evil Exterminator, as if wanting to tear him apart!</p><p></p><p>The Evil Exterminator's face grew increasingly pale: "This Saint Lord concedes, the first place of the Celestial Champion Tournament is yours!!"</p><p></p><p>Li Shuo-yan still paid no heed, flashing forward in an explosive burst.</p><p></p><p>The weakened Evil Exterminator had no way to outrun Li Shuo-yan, and was quickly caught up to!</p><p></p><p>Seeing the molten lava giant before him, the Evil Exterminator cried out in terror: "Sect Master, save me!!"</p><p></p><p>At this moment, the entire venue was silent.</p><p></p><p>Everyone was deeply immersed, the development of events completely exceeding their expectations.</p><p></p><p>No one could have imagined that the top-ranked celestial champion, the Evil Exterminator, would be pushed to this extent by a mid-stage Solar Realm cultivator!</p><p></p><p>Just then, the gloomy-faced Sect Master of the Blood Demon Sect suddenly surged forth from the audience, rushing towards the arena:</p><p></p><p>"You insolent brat, how dare you!!"</p><p></p><p>The crowd was startled, but also within their expectations. Although the celestial champion battles were a matter of life and death, they all knew the Blood Demon Sect Sect Master would not allow the Evil Exterminator to die.</p><p></p><p>After all, the resources and effort required to cultivate such an outstanding Saint Lord were truly terrifying.</p>

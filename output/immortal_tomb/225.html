        <h1>Chapter 225</h1>
        <div class="content">
            <p>Here is the full English translation of the Chinese excerpt:</p><p></p><p>Half a month later, the recruitment of disciples for the Xiaoyao Sect came to an end. This recruitment added five thousand disciples, as well as ten executors and protectors.</p><p></p><p>Among the new executors and protectors, there were several Immortal Emperors whose cultivation was even higher than that of Zhao Wuyou, one of the Five Elders.</p><p></p><p>As for Su Qianghe and Yin Jiuguai, they had already ascended to the Immortal Emperor realm in recent years.</p><p></p><p>However, the highest positions these new Immortal Emperor recruits could currently hold were that of executors and protectors, and they were ranked among the lower ones at that. It couldn't be helped, as the other positions were occupied by the elders, whom they had to serve carefully.</p><p></p><p>...</p><p></p><p>Night fell.</p><p></p><p>Peng Fang's shout suddenly rang out in the night sky.</p><p></p><p>"The Sect Master has an order, all disciples are to gather at the training grounds!!"</p><p></p><p>The Xiaoyao Sect fell silent for a moment, then erupted into an uproar!</p><p></p><p>The Sect Master summoned everyone??</p><p></p><p>No one dared to be negligent. With excited, anxious, and reverent hearts, the crowd hurriedly exited their cultivation states.</p><p></p><p>Especially for the newly recruited disciples and executors/protectors, they were exhilarated. A large part of the reason they joined the Xiaoyao Sect was to have the chance to see their idol, after all.</p><p></p><p>In an instant, countless streams of light appeared in the night sky of the Xiaoyao Sect, rushing towards the training grounds.</p><p></p><p>...</p><p></p><p>The training grounds of the Xiaoyao Sect were brightly lit.</p><p></p><p>Tens of thousands of figures sat in silence.</p><p></p><p>Aside from the Five Elders led by Peng Fang, the crowd stared blankly at the fine wines, delicious dishes, and exotic meats on the tables before them.</p><p></p><p>The Sect Master had summoned everyone - was this a feast?</p><p></p><p>The wine smelled so fragrant, though...</p><p></p><p>Aside from those who had followed Tian Zhi Hen, the rest were all from the Linglang Heavens and were exclaiming in amazement.</p><p></p><p>The Xiaoyao Sect was truly the number one sect in the Linglang Heavens - even the ordinary disciples were drinking such prestigious wine! Outside, they probably couldn't even get a taste of it.</p><p></p><p>Just then, Lu Changsheng suddenly appeared at the front.</p><p></p><p>The Five Elders led by Peng Fang were startled and hurriedly stood up, respectfully greeting, "Sect Master!"</p><p></p><p>Hearing this, the crowd was shocked and quickly stood up, bowing deeply, "Greetings to the Sect Master!!"</p><p></p><p>The sonorous voices echoed through the training grounds.</p><p></p><p>After a moment,</p><p></p><p>Lu Changsheng's eyes held a smile as he waved his hand, "Be seated."</p><p></p><p>"Yes!"</p><p></p><p>Tens of thousands of figures sat down in a grand manner, their gazes fixed intently on the young man in blue, filled with adoration and excitement!</p><p></p><p>Especially for the recent recruits, their hearts were pounding rapidly, their eyes reddened with excitement.</p><p></p><p>It was worth it! They had just joined the Xiaoyao Sect and were already seeing the mysterious and powerful Sect Master!</p><p></p><p>Lu Changsheng stood with his hands behind his back, sweeping his gaze across the crowd, and smiled faintly, "My Xiaoyao Sect has gained quite a few new faces..."</p><p></p><p>Hearing this, the newly recruited disciples and executors/protectors were startled, chuckling awkwardly. But in their hearts, a strange feeling was rising.</p><p></p><p>The outside world was constantly abuzz with rumors that the Sect Master of the Xiaoyao Sect was indifferent and ruthless, killing people like slaughtering pigs and dogs. Yet, seeing him now, he gave a very amiable impression.</p><p></p><p>It seems the rumors were just rumors after all.</p><p></p><p>"Since you have joined my Xiaoyao Sect, it means you have successfully passed the Heart-Probing Tribulation. From now on, treat the sect as your own home," Lu Changsheng said softly.</p><p></p><p>The hearts of the new recruits were instantly warmed.</p><p></p><p>Although they had just joined the Xiaoyao Sect, at this moment they felt an urge to die for the sect at any time.</p><p></p><p>After all, the one speaking these words was none other than their Sect Master, the supreme existence in the Linglang Heavens!</p><p></p><p>"Furthermore, congratulations to you all. You are the last batch to join. From now on, the Xiaoyao Sect will no longer recruit new disciples," Lu Changsheng said with a smile. "The disciples of my Xiaoyao Sect are precious in quality, not in quantity. Tens of thousands are sufficient."</p><p></p><p>Hearing this, the crowd was stunned!</p><p></p><p>A sense of inexplicable pride surged in their hearts.</p><p></p><p>Cultivators in the Linglang Heavens numbered in the billions, yet they were the fortunate ones who had joined the Xiaoyao Sect.</p><p></p><p>Suddenly, Lu Changsheng produced three scrolls in his hand and said, "This cultivation technique is called the Xiaoyao Sutra, divided into upper, middle, and lower volumes. From now on, it will be the core cultivation technique of my Xiaoyao Sect, and all of you will have the opportunity to cultivate it."</p><p></p><p>The crowd's gazes instantly burned with intensity. The cultivation technique presented by the Sect Master could not possibly be simple!</p><p></p><p>"Elder Peng, you will be responsible for establishing the cultivation system for the Xiaoyao Sutra."</p><p></p><p>Lu Changsheng pushed the three scrolls towards Peng Fang, who received them with both hands, "Yes, Sect Master."</p><p></p><p>Peng Fang was well aware of how the system should be set up.</p><p></p><p>For example, only outer sect disciples would be allowed to cultivate the first volume of the Xiaoyao Sutra. The second volume would be for inner sect disciples and core disciples.</p><p></p><p>Here is the full English translation of the Chinese excerpt:</p><p></p><p>It can be cultivated.</p><p></p><p>As for the third volume, more thresholds need to be set up.</p><p></p><p>This can greatly motivate the disciples of the sect to be more enthusiastic about their cultivation.</p><p></p><p>New 69 book bar 99 shu x.com</p><p></p><p>In this regard, he still understands a bit, after all, he has been the Grand Elder for many years.</p><p></p><p>Ahem, after going down, he will first observe and appreciate the Carefree Technique to see what its powerful aspects are.</p><p></p><p>Lu Changsheng appeared beside Peng Fang and the others,</p><p></p><p>Peng Fang's brow twitched, quick-witted, and hurriedly poured Lu Changsheng a cup of wine.</p><p></p><p>Lu Changsheng raised his glass and smiled: "Since it is to welcome the new disciples who have joined our Carefree Sect, tonight everyone can indulge, not returning until drunk."</p><p></p><p>Seeing their Sect Master's warm smile and amiable manner,</p><p></p><p>everyone let loose!</p><p></p><p>All the people quickly raised their glasses to Lu Changsheng and said with a smile: "Yes, Sect Master!!!"</p><p></p><p>Lu Changsheng nodded slightly and drained the cup in one gulp.</p><p></p><p>The others also drained the first cup of wine in one gulp!!</p><p></p><p>Lu Changsheng smiled and sat down in his seat.</p><p></p><p>The wine feast then began,</p><p></p><p>The training ground soon became lively and bustling, with all the disciples and servants moving around, their smiles radiant.</p><p></p><p>The newcomers also quickly integrated.</p><p></p><p>In the exchange of cups,</p><p></p><p>Ten new servant protectors, emboldened by the wine, came to the Elder Sect Master's seat with their cups.</p><p></p><p>They one by one toasted Lu Changsheng, Peng Fang and the others.</p><p></p><p>Lu Changsheng welcomed them all, raising his cup in response.</p><p></p><p>.........</p><p></p><p>By the time of the Yin hour.</p><p></p><p>Due to not using immortal essence to dispel the alcohol, the crowd had long since become completely drunk.</p><p></p><p>Some were flushed in the face, foolishly giggling, some were vomiting in the corners of the tables, and some were lying on the ground snoring loudly...</p><p></p><p>There were only a few sober ones left in the entire venue.</p><p></p><p>"Tong Xin, Lin Dong, come here."</p><p></p><p>Tong Xin and Lin Dong were still stubbornly competing in drinking, when they heard Lu Changsheng's summons.</p><p></p><p>The two of them shuddered, quickly using immortal essence to dispel the alcohol in their bodies, flashing in front of Lu Changsheng and bowing: "Sect Master."</p><p></p><p>Peng Fang and the others suppressed their smiles, for they vaguely knew why Lu Changsheng had summoned Tong Xin and Lin Dong.</p><p></p><p>Lu Changsheng smiled and said, "There is one thing..."</p><p></p><p>After a moment,</p><p></p><p>Tong Xin and Lin Dong's mouths slightly opened, they already knew.</p><p></p><p>Lin Dong immediately bowed and promised: "Sect Master, rest assured, in the future, Lin Dong will be more diligent in his cultivation, and will be an exemplar for the fellow disciples of the Carefree Sect."</p><p></p><p>Lu Changsheng stood up and patted his shoulder, saying, "You've forgotten that sentence again."</p><p></p><p>Lin Dong was stunned, then grinned and said, "Sect Master, Lin Dong knows, to balance work and rest."</p><p></p><p>"Mm." Lu Changsheng nodded slightly.</p><p></p><p>Tong Xin muttered beside him, "Shidi, you must take care."</p><p></p><p>Lin Dong looked at Tong Xin and smiled, "Shixiong, if you follow the Sect Master, your cultivation will be surpassed by me, then I will mock you."</p><p></p><p>Tong Xin: "......"</p><p></p><p>At this time, Lu Changsheng turned and walked out.</p><p></p><p>Tong Xin was startled, and quickly punched Lin Dong's chest, then hurried after Lu Changsheng.</p><p></p><p>"Sect Master..."</p><p></p><p>Peng Fang and the others stood up one by one, their gazes reluctant.</p><p></p><p>"While I'm away, you all take good care of the sect, and if I return to find any mistakes, I will only ask you."</p><p></p><p>Lu Changsheng's parting words echoed in their minds.</p><p></p><p>But his and Tong Xin's figures had already disappeared into the night.</p><p></p><p>"Sect Master, rest assured..."</p><p></p><p>Peng Fang and the others murmured.</p><p></p><p>After a moment, a flash of gloom appeared in Lin Dong's eyes as he turned to Peng Fang and asked, "Grand Elder, may I take a look at the Carefree Technique first?"</p><p></p><p>Peng Fang hesitated, knowing that Lin Dong was a cultivation fanatic, and silently handed the three scrolls to Lin Dong: "Holy Son... take a quick look, this Elder hasn't seen it either..."</p><p></p><p>"Good, Grand Elder, don't worry." Lin Dong happily took the Carefree Technique and flashed away.</p><p></p><p>Peng Fang: "......"</p><p></p><p>Soon, the training ground of the Carefree Sect was left with only the sober Peng Fang and the others, sighing one after another, while all the others had entered dreamland.</p><p></p><p>From the smiles on everyone's faces, it was clear that the wine was delicious and the dreams were sweet.</p><p></p><p>.........</p><p></p><p>Linglong Sky, Diyu, Chenxi Town.</p><p></p><p>"Big brother, the evening lantern festival is about to begin, won't you come with me to take a look?"</p><p></p><p>The young lady clung to the young man's arm and swayed, coaxing.</p><p></p><p>The young man patted her head and smiled indulgently: "I really can't refuse you."</p><p></p><p>He then picked up the wine jar beside him and took a sip, but he frowned and sighed, the taste... not good.</p><p></p><p>The young lady suddenly asked, "Brother, do you still miss the taste of Xihun Liquor?"</p><p></p><p>The young man paused, a smile appearing at the corners of his mouth as he said, "Miss it."</p><p></p><p>The young lady laughed: "Hehe, I miss it too."</p><p></p><p>The young man looked at the gradually darkening sky and murmured, "It's really hard to fathom the thoughts of the seniors..."</p>

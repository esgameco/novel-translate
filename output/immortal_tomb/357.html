        <h1>Chapter 357</h1>
        <div class="content">
            <p>Here is the full English translation of the excerpt from the Chinese novel:</p><p></p><p>"Huh?</p><p></p><p>Wait a moment?</p><p></p><p>Who would have thought that such words would come from the mouth of Lord Sword Sovereign!</p><p></p><p>At this moment, not only Mo Liang Qiu and the others, even Han Jinlong and Yan Jueyi were stunned!</p><p></p><p>Just what kind of background does this young friend Lu have?</p><p></p><p>Could it be that he is actually acquainted with Lord Sword Sovereign?</p><p></p><p>Only Mang Tian and Jiang Wuxin exchanged a knowing glance and smiled, unsurprised.</p><p></p><p>If this young friend Lu truly possesses the Eternal Lifeform, then given time, he will undoubtedly become the true leader of the human race!</p><p></p><p>Lord Sword Sovereign naturally would not mind.</p><p></p><p>Just as the crowd was furrowing their brows and pondering deeply, a figure in azure robes finally slowly appeared in the sky, filling the ninth position.</p><p></p><p>"Greetings, everyone. Apologies for the wait," Lu Changsheng said with a courteous smile.</p><p></p><p>The sea of people immediately stirred, all scrutinizing the young man in azure robes.</p><p></p><p>So this is the senior Lu Changsheng?</p><p></p><p>The Crimson Yang Palace's Patriarch Moyang, however, was greatly alarmed. He never expected that the Patriarch of the Carefree Sect would actually, actually...</p><p></p><p>He inwardly rejoiced, praising his own keen insight!</p><p></p><p>If not for this, his Crimson Yang Palace would have been doomed.</p><p></p><p>Truly a peak expert of the Divine Profound Realm!</p><p></p><p>"It is indeed the Patriarch!" Peng Fang and the others were somewhat excited. The Patriarch was truly elusive, and to see him in person was extremely rare.</p><p></p><p>In the sky, whether the three Divine Profound Realms or the crowd of Divine Profound cultivators, all were eyeing the unfamiliar young man in azure robes with astonishment.</p><p></p><p>As for Mo Liang Qiu and the others, they were relatively fine, having seen him before, but they were still greatly shocked.</p><p></p><p>This friend Lu is truly extraordinary, daring to keep the five Lords waiting, and upon arrival, he was neither humble nor arrogant, not even bothering to pay his respects.</p><p></p><p>How audacious!</p><p></p><p>"Friend Lu, you should quickly pay your respects to Lord Sword Sovereign and the other three Lords!" </p><p></p><p>At this time, Han Jinlong said to Lu Changsheng, his tone somewhat anxious.</p><p></p><p>The crowd below also snapped out of their daze, looking at Lu Changsheng in disbelief.</p><p></p><p>That's right, why did he not pay his respects to the Lords...</p><p></p><p>Who in the human race would dare?</p><p></p><p>Yet Lu Changsheng stood with his hands behind his back, as if he had not heard.</p><p></p><p>In this world, only others should pay respects to him, Lu Changsheng.</p><p></p><p>Others, what qualifications do they have to receive his salute?</p><p></p><p>Seeing this, Han Jinlong and Yan Jueyi's eyes narrowed slightly, their hearts growing somewhat anxious.</p><p></p><p>The space fell into a momentary silence...</p><p></p><p>However, at this time, Jian Wuhui smiled and cupped his hands: "Young friend Lu, it has been ten thousand years since we last met in the Eternal Void Realm. I'm glad to see you well."</p><p></p><p>Mang Tian and Jiang Wuxin also smiled and cupped their hands: "Young friend Lu, it's good to see you again."</p><p></p><p>Regarding Lu Changsheng, they naturally could not treat him as an ordinary Divine Profound cultivator.</p><p></p><p>If he truly possesses the Eternal Lifeform, then he would be the greatest treasure and trump card of the human race, and he may even become the most honored figure in the future.</p><p></p><p>Although he has not yet fully matured, he is already at the Divine Profound Realm, and his complete maturation is not far off.</p><p></p><p>Such a young friend Lu, they naturally had to show him respect, no matter how equal they were.</p><p></p><p>If they were to use their status as Lords to cause any discomfort to young friend Lu, that would be a loss.</p><p></p><p>This could also be considered an investment and a gamble, after all, whether the Eternal Lifeform truly exists is still uncertain...</p><p></p><p>...</p><p></p><p>After Jian Wuhui and the others greeted Lu Changsheng with cupped hands, everyone in this space was petrified!</p><p></p><p>All eyes trembled as they looked at the young man in azure robes, their hearts shaking!</p><p></p><p>He had appeared as if out of thin air, and what was even more terrifying was the attitude of the three Lords!</p><p></p><p>They were actually so courteous to him?</p><p></p><p>It was truly bone-chilling!</p><p></p><p>But why? This senior Lu Changsheng was clearly able to participate in the Seven-Colored Jade Tower, which meant his cultivation was at the Divine Profound Realm.</p><p></p><p>How could the Divine Profound Realm make Lord Sword Sovereign and the others so courteous?</p><p></p><p>Mysterious, utterly mysterious!</p><p></p><p>Moyang was completely dumbfounded, his whole body trembling, determined to bring a thick gift to the Carefree Sect to apologize as soon as he returned.</p><p></p><p>At this moment, a look of surprise flashed in Lu Changsheng's eyes as he cupped his hands and replied with a smile, "Greetings, the three of you. It's good to see you again."</p><p></p><p>Lu Changsheng felt that Jian Wuhui and the others still gave him a good impression, but he wondered if they were so certain that he possessed the Eternal Lifeform.</p><p></p><p>The crowd watched this scene, their eyelids twitching.</p><p></p><p>How was this any different from the greetings between peers?</p><p></p><p>Lord Sword Sovereign and the others were like old friends with this senior Lu Changsheng.</p><p></p><p>"Huh?" </p><p></p><p>Han Jinlong and Yan Jueyi snapped out of their daze, finally looking at Jian Wuhui and the others in bewilderment."</p><p></p><p>Here is the full English translation of the Chinese novel excerpt:</p><p></p><p>"Lord Sword Sovereign, do you, do you all know Junior Lu?" Han Jinlong asked with a puzzled expression.</p><p></p><p>Yan Jueyi also looked at Lu Changsheng, then at Jian Wuhui and the others, wanting to say something but hesitating.</p><p></p><p>"Yes, this Sovereign, the Tyrant King, and the Windwalking Venerable are acquainted with Junior Lu," Jian Wuhui said with a smile, not elaborating further.</p><p></p><p>Han Jinlong and Yan Jueyi nodded, being intelligent people, and did not ask any more questions, but their gazes towards Lu Changsheng had completely changed.</p><p></p><p>In their hearts, Lu Changsheng had become increasingly unfathomable.</p><p></p><p>As for the three Shenxuan Realm cultivators below, as well as the other Shenxuan Realm cultivators, they reverently glanced at Lu Changsheng and then lowered their heads, not daring to speak.</p><p></p><p>Undeniably, after today, the unfamiliar name of Lu Changsheng would be thoroughly known throughout the human race.</p><p></p><p>And it would be beyond the three Shenyou Realm cultivators and the group of Shenxuan Realm cultivators!</p><p></p><p>After all, to be able to make the Sword Sovereign and the other few overlords so polite...</p><p></p><p>In the entire human race, no one else could achieve this!</p><p></p><p>"Alright," Jian Wuhui looked at the nine people including Lu Changsheng and said, "This trip to the Seven-Colored Crystal Pagoda is very important to our human race!"</p><p></p><p>Except for Lu Changsheng, who still stood upright and exchanged smiles with the bewildered Han Jinlong, the other eight people hurriedly bowed and shouted, "Rest assured, Lord Sword Sovereign, we will not let down the human race!"</p><p></p><p>Jian Wuhui nodded slightly, then called out, "Windwalking Venerable, Golden Wheel King."</p><p></p><p>"The Sword Sovereign may speak," Jiang Wuxin and Han Jinlong stepped forward and bowed.</p><p></p><p>Jian Wuhui smiled and said, "Whoever goes, the same number shall return, this Sovereign will wait for you in the human realm."</p><p></p><p>"The Sword Sovereign can rest assured," Han Jinlong and Jiang Wuxin acknowledged the order.</p><p></p><p>Jian Wuhui took a light breath, suddenly turning to look outside the human realm territory and said, "Set out, this Sovereign will open a bright path for you!"</p><p></p><p>As he spoke, a ancient bronze sword appeared in his hand!</p><p></p><p>Then, sensing that there were no human patrols in the area, he swung the sword with lightning speed towards the front!</p><p></p><p>Whoosh!</p><p></p><p>Instantly, a golden crescent-shaped sword qi, about a thousand zhang high, fiercely broke through the air!</p><p></p><p>In the blink of an eye, the golden crescent sword qi had reached the edge of the human realm territory, piercing into the war mist, unstoppable!</p><p></p><p>Wherever it passed, the mist was completely dispersed!</p><p></p><p>Outside the human city, the crowd watched with awe-struck gazes at the sight before them...</p><p></p><p>The war mist in their line of sight seemed to have been split in two, with only the middle part being exceptionally clear, truly like a bright path!</p><p></p><p>Was this the power of the Sword Sovereign?</p><p></p><p>As Jian Wuhui sheathed the long sword, Jiang Wuxin and Han Jinlong snapped out of their daze.</p><p></p><p>Han Jinlong suddenly raised a hand, summoning a blazing solar wheel!</p><p></p><p>The blazing solar wheel burned with flames, growing larger and larger, and when it reached the size of a mountain peak, he shouted, "Aboard my Blazing Solar Wheel!"</p><p></p><p>Mu Liangshou and the others were stunned, not expecting such an impressive arrangement today. With the Sword Sovereign personally opening the path, and the Golden Wheel King providing the Blazing Solar Wheel as a flying vessel.</p><p></p><p>"Yes!" </p><p></p><p>The next moment, Jiang Wuxin, Mu Liangshou and the others stepped onto the Blazing Solar Wheel, and Lu Changsheng also flashed onto it, leisurely surveying the Blazing Solar Wheel.</p><p></p><p>Han Jinlong seemed to have remembered something, suddenly calling out, "Zhao Di, you come up too!"</p><p></p><p>Among the Shenxuan Realm team, the eagerly awaiting Zhao Di immediately teared up, overjoyed that the Golden Wheel King had not forgotten him.</p><p></p><p>He then boarded the Blazing Solar Wheel amidst the many astonished gazes.</p><p></p><p>After nodding to Jian Wuhui, the Tyrant Sky, and Yan Jueyi, Han Jinlong no longer hesitated, and led the Blazing Solar Wheel to soar towards the bright path ahead!</p><p></p><p>On the Blazing Solar Wheel,</p><p></p><p>the clothes of the group fluttered in the wind as they turned to look at the gradually shrinking human city, and the vast human sea like countless ants outside the city.</p><p></p><p>Lu Changsheng stood with his hands behind his back, his gaze calm.</p><p></p><p>He could see that in the sky above, Jian Wuhui, the Tyrant Sky, Yan Jueyi, and the other powerful cultivators were still watching them off.</p><p></p><p>Suddenly, the human sea outside the city became restless, as if in a pre-arranged agreement, they bent down and the uplifting voices rode the wind!</p><p></p><p>"Esteemed seniors, please uphold the honor of our human race!"</p><p></p><p>On the Blazing Solar Wheel, Mu Liangshou and the others couldn't help but have their eyes redden, their fists clenched tightly, suppressing the surging blood in their bodies!</p><p></p><p>Wasn't the reason they had worked hard to cultivate and obtain the qualification to participate in the Seven-Colored Crystal Pagoda precisely to personally trample those foreign races and uphold the honor of the human race?</p><p></p><p>Sensing the mentality of Mu Liangshou and the others, Han Jinlong and Jiang Wuxin exchanged a sentimental smile, their hearts also tense.</p><p></p><p>They suddenly looked at the standing Junior Lu at the edge, his expression still as calm as the abyss, making them unable to see through him.</p><p></p><p>"Whoosh-"</p><p></p><p>The Blazing Solar Wheel instantly shot into the bright path, disappearing into a black dot!</p>

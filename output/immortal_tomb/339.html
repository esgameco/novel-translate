        <h1>Chapter 339</h1>
        <div class="content">
            <p>Here is the full English translation of the Chinese excerpt:</p><p></p><p>"Sword Sovereign, that friend Lu is truly extraordinary in talent..." </p><p></p><p>Jiang Wuxin sighed.</p><p></p><p>After thinking for a while, he did not plan to tell Jian Wuhui about the matter of the Eternal Life Body for the time being.</p><p></p><p>After all, whether there is an Eternal Life Body or not is still up for debate.</p><p></p><p>Additionally... he wanted to protect Lu Changsheng, their human Sword Sovereign, in case he might covet the Eternal Life Body. They really couldn't guarantee it.</p><p></p><p>Even if they were compatriots, even if they understood each other well, the human nature is the most unfathomable.</p><p></p><p>"Yes, yes, yes! Friend Lu destroyed the remaining clan of Zi Xuanyong in the Eternal Realm, and on top of that, Friend Lu is from our human race, with extraordinary talent. Naturally, Zi Xuanyong wants to use this as a pretext to eliminate him as soon as possible!" </p><p></p><p>Ban Tian kept nodding.</p><p></p><p>Jian Wuhui fell silent for a moment. He naturally understood Lu Changsheng's extraordinary talent, it was truly monstrous.</p><p></p><p>But it didn't make sense. Zi Xuanyong wouldn't offend the human race just because of Lu Changsheng, the Void Beast Clan was relatively neutral on the Divine-Demon Battlefield.</p><p></p><p>Moreover, with him, Jian Wuhui, guarding the human race, he didn't believe Zi Xuanyong would do such a losing proposition.</p><p></p><p>This matter seems to have hidden circumstances. What exactly is it that even Ban Tian and Jiang Wuxin have to hide from him...</p><p></p><p>But he also didn't plan to break the pot and ask for the truth at the moment, he was not that verbose of a person.</p><p></p><p>Moreover, Lu Changsheng is still far away in the Eternal Realm, thousands of miles away from the Divine-Demon Battlefield.</p><p></p><p>He remembered that he had told Lu Changsheng to come to the Divine-Demon Battlefield, and he didn't know if he was on his way yet.</p><p></p><p>He then smiled and said, "Actually, the Lu friend you mentioned, I've met him too, his talent is indeed extraordinary."</p><p></p><p>Ah?</p><p></p><p>Ban Tian and Jiang Wuxin were stunned, and then bitterly smiled inwardly. It seemed Jian Wuhui had just been fishing for their words.</p><p></p><p>Regarding Jian Wuhui's acquaintance with Lu Changsheng, they immediately thought of Jian Wuhui's ancestral clan in the Eternal Realm, it seems Jian Wuhui had also been summoned by his ancestors.</p><p></p><p>And it was before them.</p><p></p><p>But soon, Jiang Wuxin and Ban Tian's brows furrowed again...</p><p></p><p>Regarding the Eternal Life Body, they had just overlooked it earlier...</p><p></p><p>If they truly cared about Friend Lu, they should tell Jian Wuhui about the Eternal Life Body matter! They couldn't hide it!</p><p></p><p>"Sword Sovereign!" Jiang Wuxin suddenly looked up.</p><p></p><p>Jian Wuhui's eyes flickered: "Wind Sage, please go on."</p><p></p><p>Jiang Wuxin glanced at Ban Tian, then stood up and sighed, "Sword Sovereign, if possible... we must find a way to eliminate Zi Konghuang, Blood Empress, Yan Wolf King, Heavenly Demon King, and Nine-Winged King."</p><p></p><p>Jian Wuhui's hand holding the tea cup paused, and he also slowly stood up, frowning at Jiang Wuxin: "What do you mean?"</p><p></p><p>These five were not ordinary figures on the Divine-Demon Battlefield!</p><p></p><p>Jiang Wuxin turned around, looking directly at Jian Wuhui, and said:</p><p></p><p>"Zi Xuanyong believes that Lu Changsheng has... the Eternal Life Body."</p><p></p><p>Upon hearing this,</p><p></p><p>Jian Wuhui's tea cup even shook a little in his hand. He was silent for a moment, then said, "What makes them think Lu Xiaoyu has the Eternal Life Body?"</p><p></p><p>"That day..." Jiang Wuxin then told Jian Wuhui about the events of that day.</p><p></p><p>At the end, he bitterly smiled and said, "Yes, Zi Xuanyong and the others can't be sure whether Lu Xiaoyu has the Eternal Life Body or not, but... even the slightest possibility, they won't give up."</p><p></p><p>After all, the Eternal Life Body is a legendary constitution, far surpassing the Divine Body Ranking.</p><p></p><p>What do cultivators in the world struggle, fight, and plunder treasures for?</p><p></p><p>Here is the full English translation of the excerpt from the Chinese novel:</p><p></p><p>"Isn't it just the elusive immortality?" </p><p></p><p>The new 69 book bar 89shu.com</p><p></p><p>But for those who possess the Eternal Life Physique, who wouldn't covet immortality?</p><p></p><p>"So these five are the ones that must be eliminated, and it must be done quickly, otherwise if the news gets out... our human race may face a catastrophic disaster!"</p><p></p><p>Jiang Wuxin said solemnly.</p><p></p><p>Jian Wuhui looked down at the tea in his hand, "Mm, then let's kill them."</p><p></p><p>Jiang Wuxin and Man Tianwen were slightly delighted to hear this, since the Sword Sovereign was willing to take action, this matter could be done.</p><p></p><p>The two of them alone would not be enough.</p><p></p><p>This matter seems to also require the cooperation of the Golden Wheel King and the Cudgel Saint from the Human City.</p><p></p><p>Jian Wuhui sat down, pondered for a moment, and looked at Man Tianwen and Jiang Wuxin: "Man King, Wind Sage."</p><p></p><p>"Sword Sovereign, please command us." The two hurriedly cupped their hands.</p><p></p><p>Jian Wuhui nodded and said, "Since we need to eliminate them, when you two go back, agree to Purple Mysterious Yin's invitation as a ruse."</p><p></p><p>Man Tianwen and Jiang Wuxin solemnly nodded their heads.</p><p></p><p>Jian Wuhui: "Since Purple Mysterious Yin wants to kill you, that means the other four will definitely be present at the time, after all, Purple Mysterious Yin alone cannot handle the two of you."</p><p></p><p>Man Tianwen and Jiang Wuxin glanced at each other, neither confirming nor denying.</p><p></p><p>Purple Mysterious Yin's individual combat strength is indeed stronger than either of them, but to fight one against two would be very difficult.</p><p></p><p>"You two should tell Purple Mysterious Yin that the meeting time will be set after the Seven-colored Glazed Pagoda." Jian Wuhui instructed again.</p><p></p><p>"Yes." Jiang Wuxin and Man Tianwen bowed in response, indeed, the Seven-colored Glazed Pagoda was imminent, and now was not the time for action.</p><p></p><p>Soon, Jiang Wuxin hesitated and said, "Sword Sovereign... if we want to resolve the issue with Purple Mysterious Yin and the others as quickly as possible, perhaps we should call on the Golden Wheel King and the Cudgel Saint from the Human City, but the matter of Lu Xiaoyou..."</p><p></p><p>If the two of them went to call the Golden Wheel King and the Cudgel Saint, they would surely be asked about the reason, and it would be better if fewer people knew about Lu Xiaoyou's matter...</p><p></p><p>Jian Wuhui naturally understood Jiang Wuxin's meaning, and smiled, "You don't need to tell them about Lu Xiaoyou's matter, this operation is at my command."</p><p></p><p>"Yes!" Jiang Wuxin and Man Tianwen were just waiting for this sentence.</p><p></p><p>They sighed inwardly, Lu Xiaoyou really has inadvertently caused them a big trouble...</p><p></p><p>After all, Purple Mysterious Yin and the Blood Moon Sect are not ordinary figures, although they say it's easy this time, when it comes to actually taking action, it won't be that simple.</p><p></p><p>Helpless, Lu Xiaoyou is their human race's prodigy, and so brilliant, of course they have to help him.</p><p></p><p>Of course, the most important thing is that this matter is closely related to the human race. If it is not handled properly, the news of the Eternal Life Physique, if known by other races, would be a devastating blow to the human race.</p><p></p><p>Even if the human race really doesn't have the Eternal Life Physique, those other races will use this as an opportunity to completely drag the human race down into the abyss!</p><p></p><p>Ah, I don't know if Lu Xiaoyou has arrived at the Divine-Demon Battlefield or not. If he hasn't, it's better if he doesn't come.</p><p></p><p>"Alright, Man King, Wind Sage, you two can go back now, don't hurry to tell the Golden Wheel King and the Cudgel Saint about the operation, everything... wait until after the Seven-colored Glazed Pagoda."</p><p></p><p>Jian Wuhui said in a deep voice.</p><p></p><p>"Mm, then we two will return to the Underground City first."</p><p></p><p>The two slightly bowed and then disappeared.</p><p></p><p>In the main hall, Jian Wuhui was left alone, quietly drinking tea.</p><p></p><p>Suddenly, from the dark corner, a beautiful woman slowly walked out and sat down beside him, softly asking:</p><p></p><p>"Master, do you say that the Eternal Life Physique is real or false?"</p>

        <h1>Chapter 186</h1>
        <div class="content">
            <p>Here is the full English translation of the Chinese excerpt:</p><p></p><p>"My surname is...Lu. ‚ôùüêú‚ùª‚ùæùê¨ùíΩùìäÔº∏.ÔΩÉùïÜùêåüëåüéà"</p><p></p><p>As Lu Changsheng's words fell, </p><p></p><p>"Not a member of the Battle Clan's imperial family?"</p><p></p><p>Lu... Lu... Ah! Lu!!!</p><p></p><p>Suddenly realizing something, the breaths of the elders like Jin Hua and the disciples like Xiao Yan abruptly paused!</p><p></p><p>A chill rose from the bottom of their hearts, instantly spreading throughout their bodies, bone-chillingly cold.</p><p></p><p>Jin Hua's face turned deathly pale. Regaining his senses, he hastily released the Immortal King's pressure, pinning the many bewildered disciples kneeling on the ground.</p><p></p><p>Then he and the other elders hurriedly knelt down, foreheads touching the ground.</p><p></p><p>Jin Hua's pupils trembled violently as he fearfully said, "We are humble cultivators, paying respects to Senior Lu!"</p><p></p><p>Everyone was kowtowing desperately, not daring to even breathe.</p><p></p><p>Xiao Yan, Cold Qing, Zhang Sheng and the other disciples were disoriented, not knowing where they were.</p><p></p><p>They... they had unknowingly brought back the number one scourge of the Heavenly Scar...ah, this...</p><p></p><p>Recalling the past few days, they were terrified and full of regret.</p><p></p><p>They had dared to address Senior Lu as "Dao Companion Battle."</p><p></p><p>The Battle Clan's imperial family seems to have a grudge against Senior Lu?</p><p></p><p>It's a miracle they're still alive.</p><p></p><p>No wonder Xiao Yan's attempt to seek his help the other day was ignored, no wonder he always felt Senior Lu's voice sounded familiar - the Lu Changsheng who conversed with the Battle Clan that day, the number one expert of the Heavenly Scar, was him!</p><p></p><p>No one doubted the authenticity, as the time, place, and everything matched perfectly.</p><p></p><p>And in this Heavenly Scar, who would dare to impersonate the true Lu Changsheng?</p><p></p><p>Lu Changsheng inexplicably surveyed the extremely nervous Dragon Sect disciples, then leisurely walked away without saying a word.</p><p></p><p>Hearing his footsteps gradually fade into the distance until they disappeared, the crowd finally heaved a huge sigh of relief.</p><p></p><p>Looking around, although they were all cultivators, they were drenched in sweat, their clothes soaked through.</p><p></p><p>It was clear they were truly terrified to the core.</p><p></p><p>"Phew~" Jin Hua, still shaken, took a deep breath, using immortal energy to instantly dry his clothes. He then turned and swept his gaze over the disciples, utterly speechless.</p><p></p><p>"Bringing who wasn't good, and you actually brought back Senior Lu! You little bastards, you really want to destroy the sect, don't you!"</p><p></p><p>Seeing the elders' expressions, the disciples lowered their heads in fear.</p><p></p><p>"Hmph! Xiao Yan, on the way here, my Dragon Sect disciples shouldn't have offended Senior Lu, right? If anyone did, let me tell you, even if Senior Lu doesn't hold a grudge, I'll personally skin you alive!"</p><p></p><p>Jin Hua purposely shouted loudly, his expression ferocious and his tone extremely fierce, afraid that Lu Changsheng had not gone far enough.</p><p></p><p>Xiao Yan and the other disciples were truly frightened, their faces turning pale as they frantically shook their heads.</p><p></p><p>The elders from the Three Purities Palace and the Scorching Sun Valley also hurriedly asked Zhang Sheng and Cold Qing, terrified, for they feared this ruthless man who had destroyed an imperial clan.</p><p></p><p>Zhang Sheng and Cold Qing quickly shook their heads, directly stating that even without knowing Lu Changsheng's identity, they had been very polite to him throughout the journey and did not offend him.</p><p></p><p>This greatly relieved the elders.</p><p></p><p>At this moment, Cold Qing caught a glimpse of Xiao Yan out of the corner of his eye, then looked at Jin Hua and said, "However, Elder Jin, when we were in the middle enclosure, your Dragon Sect disciples seemed to have some resentment towards Senior Lu, their expressions clearly showing it. I even noticed it, so I'm sure Senior Lu also..."</p><p></p><p>The implication was clear.</p><p></p><p>Including Xiao Yan, the Dragon Sect disciples' faces changed slightly.</p><p></p><p>Immediately, Jin Hua was frightened, looking at Xiao Yan and the others in disbelief, and roared furiously, "After returning to the sect, all of you will go to the Punishment Hall and receive two hundred lightning lashes! If Senior Lu pursues this matter later, our Dragon Sect will be ruined..."</p><p></p><p>Towards the end, Jin Hua was utterly dejected.</p><p></p><p>Whew, two hundred lightning lashes, that's as good as death.</p><p></p><p>Not to mention the other disciples, even</p><p></p><p>Here is the full English translation of the Chinese excerpt:</p><p></p><p>It was Xiao Yan, his heart trembling with trepidation.</p><p></p><p>Seeing this, Cold Qing and Zhang Sheng exchanged a knowing glance and chuckled.</p><p></p><p>[New 69 Book Bar]</p><p></p><p>With these two hundred strikes, Xiao Yan's strength would decline, and he would have to rest for at least two and a half years... </p><p></p><p>During this period, as long as they diligently cultivated, they might very likely catch up to him.</p><p></p><p>...</p><p></p><p>After leaving the extremely dense forest,</p><p></p><p>Lu Changsheng unhurriedly retraced his steps back in the direction he had come.</p><p></p><p>He did not teleport or fly, but simply strode forward, covering distances of ten or even a hundred zhang at a time.</p><p></p><p>His pace never seemed to be in a hurry.</p><p></p><p>Amidst the mountains and wilderness, clouds and mist swirled.</p><p></p><p>Lu Changsheng took a sip of wine from the gourd he was carrying, then gazed at the mountain peaks shrouded in the mist, suddenly murmuring to himself,</p><p></p><p>"I wonder if there is a place in this world where I can stop and rest."</p><p></p><p>After a moment, </p><p></p><p>he let out a wry laugh, "Probably not."</p><p></p><p>As the words left his lips,</p><p></p><p>a gentle breeze arose, the mist surging, and a figure in azure robes gradually merged into the verdant expanse of the mountains.</p><p></p><p>...</p><p></p><p>Three months later.</p><p></p><p>Black Demon Domain, Qingxuan Town.</p><p></p><p>As a figure in azure robes leisurely approached from the distance,</p><p></p><p>the two guards at the town gate paused, exchanging a puzzled glance, then vigorously rubbed their eyes and looked again.</p><p></p><p>"Innkeeper! Innkeeper!"</p><p></p><p>The two guards were stunned.</p><p></p><p>Innkeeper? What innkeeper?</p><p></p><p>The Innkeeper!</p><p></p><p>The cultivators queuing to enter the town were first puzzled, then suddenly trembled, quickly looking around, only to see Lu Changsheng.</p><p></p><p>The Innkeeper has returned!</p><p></p><p>The cultivators' eyes shone with reverence and admiration, and they quickly and orderly parted to the sides, creating a wide path for Lu Changsheng to pass through.</p><p></p><p>They bent over in excitement, as if it had been pre-arranged, and in unison called out, "Welcome back, Innkeeper, to Qingxuan!"</p><p></p><p>Lu Changsheng had reached the town gate, his steps never faltering as he entered, jokingly remarking, "You all, don't think that just because of this enthusiastic welcome, I'll be giving out free drinks and waiving the queue. The line still has to be followed, and the spirit stones still have to be paid."</p><p></p><p>Saying this, he disappeared from the dumbfounded cultivators' sight.</p><p></p><p>A moment of silence, then the area around the town gate suddenly erupted in laughter and chatter.</p><p></p><p>"Haha, the Innkeeper is truly a remarkable person. He is the supreme overlord of this Heavenly Scar, yet he has not a shred of arrogance, so amiable!"</p><p></p><p>"Hehe, the Innkeeper is naturally amiable, but that's because you haven't offended him. If you do, then you'll see how amiable he is..."</p><p></p><p>"..."</p><p></p><p>"Hey, you two gate guards, can you hurry up? I still need to go queue at the Innkeeper's tavern, it's my turn today!!"</p><p></p><p>Instantly, countless envious gazes were cast upon that cultivator.</p><p></p><p>Seeing this, the cultivator inwardly gloated, his nose almost reaching the sky.</p><p></p><p>At the same time,</p><p></p><p>Qingxuan Town had already erupted in a frenzy.</p><p></p><p>The Innkeeper has returned!</p><p></p><p>What followed was a comical scene, with Lu Changsheng walking ahead, and a vast sea of people trailing behind him, their faces shining with excitement.</p><p></p><p>Lu Changsheng wore a serene smile, allowing them to follow.</p><p></p><p>Soon, they arrived at the Long Life Tavern.</p><p></p><p>The left gate guard Rou Shanshan and the rocking chair occupant Peng Fangshen were startled, immediately rushing to greet him.</p><p></p><p>At this point, Lu Changsheng stopped, turning to face the crowd.</p><p></p><p>All sound disappeared, and everyone looked at the young man before them with reverence.</p><p></p><p>Lu Changsheng smiled faintly, "To express my gratitude for your continued support of my Long Life Tavern, tomorrow the tavern will be offering a new batch of wine to reward both new and old customers. Note that..."</p><p></p><p>"Everyone will be able to drink one cup for free."</p><p></p><p>Outside the Long Life Tavern, the expressions of the crowd froze, and they suddenly pinched their neighbors, hearing their agonized cries, only then realizing this was not a dream!</p><p></p><p>The next moment, a thunderous cheer erupted.</p><p></p><p>"Whoa, the Innkeeper is mighty!!"</p>

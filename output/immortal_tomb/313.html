        <h1>Chapter 313</h1>
        <div class="content">
            <p>Here is the full English translation of the excerpt from the Chinese novel:</p><p></p><p>"The one who destroys the Ancient Desolate God Sword is Lu Changsheng!"</p><p></p><p>The words were spoken with a chilling and murderous aura that shook the heavens and earth!</p><p></p><p>Countless powerful experts from the forces closest to the Ancient Desolate God Sword Clan's domain rushed over, </p><p></p><p>their eyes transfixed as they gazed at the distant sky...</p><p></p><p>The sword shadows falling like a river of stars viciously pierced their vision!</p><p></p><p>The thunderous sword cries reverberated through the heavens and earth, echoing in their ears and minds!</p><p></p><p>They no longer had the time to ponder the fact that the Ancient Desolate God Sword Clan had been hidden here all along,</p><p></p><p>they only knew that an unimaginably powerful expert was attacking the Ancient Desolate God Sword Clan!</p><p></p><p>And these sword shadows blanketing the sky were the means of that peerless expert!</p><p></p><p>Lu Changsheng... they had never heard of him before.</p><p></p><p>"Look, that figure, could it be the senior who is attacking the Ancient Desolate God Sword Clan?" </p><p></p><p>Suddenly, someone with sharp eyes spotted a faint blue figure amidst the endless sword shadows.</p><p></p><p>The crowd shuddered, focusing their gaze, and their pupils instantly constricted!</p><p></p><p>...</p><p></p><p>Within the Ancient Desolate God Sword Clan.</p><p></p><p>Li Shuyan, Blood Demon Moon, and other supreme experts had already been swept out by Lu Changsheng.</p><p></p><p>"Swoosh, swoosh, swoosh, swoosh!"</p><p></p><p>Endless sword rain poured down, blanketing the entire Ancient Desolate God Sword Clan, leaving bloodshed and severed limbs in its wake wherever it went.</p><p></p><p>"Ah, ah, ah! Help! Ancestor, Clan Leader, save us! Save us!"</p><p></p><p>"This... what kind of technique is this? Even the Ancestor is unable to resist, is there a realm beyond the Divine Dao? Someone tell me! Tell me!!"</p><p></p><p>"Save... ah!"</p><p></p><p>"..."</p><p></p><p>The Ancient Desolate God Sword Clan had already been dyed in blood, like a hell on earth!</p><p></p><p>With every moment, lives were being erased by the sword energy!</p><p></p><p>The nine Sword Ancestor Elders frantically evaded the sword energy while witnessing the scene in the clan, their eyes about to burst.</p><p></p><p>What crime had their Ancient Desolate God Sword Clan committed to deserve this? Lu Changsheng's heart was so ruthless!</p><p></p><p>Their Ancient Desolate God Sword Clan had many profound techniques, and the Heavenly Stone Sword was already one of their deepest foundations!</p><p></p><p>But what could they use to block this Lu Changsheng? And the approaching Void-Severing Sword, how were they to defend against that?</p><p></p><p>The Sword Ancestor Elders had never felt as desperate as they did now!</p><p></p><p>Watching their clansmen dying one after another in the sword rain, hearing the frantic screams, and the approaching Void-Severing Sword, their hearts were burning with anxiety.</p><p></p><p>Suddenly, he seemed to have thought of something, a glimmer of hope appearing in his eyes as he looked towards the Clan Leader and growled, "Qiancang, where is the Ancestral Seal? The Ancestral Seal?!"</p><p></p><p>The Clan Leader, hearing this, was startled, then quickly retrieved a palm-sized ancient sword seal and handed it to the Sword Ancestor Elder.</p><p></p><p>The Elders and the Six Great Sword Masters' eyes lit up, a glimmer of hope appearing in them!</p><p></p><p>If the Heavenly Stone Sword was their Ancient Desolate God Sword Clan's second foundation, then the Ancestral Seal was their first foundation!!</p><p></p><p>They still had a chance!</p><p></p><p>The Sword Ancestor Elder gripped the Ancestral Seal, his eyes resolute. This was their Ancient Desolate God Sword Clan's last lifeline!</p><p></p><p>His gaze hardened, and he swiftly slashed the Ancestral Seal against his own wrist.</p><p></p><p>Instantly, blood gushed out like a fountain, quickly drenching the Ancestral Seal. His face turned deathly pale, his body weakening, for this was not ordinary blood, but essence blood!</p><p></p><p>The Sword Ancestor Elder, weak and hurried, said, "Not enough, it's still not enough. Qiancang, you all quickly use your essence blood to nourish the Ancestral Seal!"</p><p></p><p>Hearing this, the eight Clan Leaders anxiously looked at the approaching Void-Severing Sword, then resolutely slashed their own wrists, and eight streams of rich essence blood...</p><p></p><p>Here is the full English translation of the Chinese excerpt:</p><p></p><p>Plunging into the Ancestral Seal!</p><p></p><p>The new ⑥⑨ book bar → ⑥⑨shux.com</p><p></p><p>At this moment, the Ancestral Seal finally began to emit a dazzling glow!</p><p></p><p>The Venerable Sword Ancestor was delighted, and he roared, "Got it, it's reacting!!"</p><p></p><p>Immediately, he hurled the Ancestral Seal towards the oncoming Zhan Xu!</p><p></p><p>"Boom!"</p><p></p><p>The two collided, and a huge explosion suddenly resounded!</p><p></p><p>"Clang!"</p><p></p><p>After a momentary pause, a mournful sword cry suddenly rang out.</p><p></p><p>Zhan Xu, in the dumbfounded gaze of Li Shuyan and the others... was broken!</p><p></p><p>Li Shuyan's face turned pale, and cold sweat dripped down. He knew how hard the Venerable Sword's Zhan Xu was, it could even cut through the Heavenly Dao, but today it was actually...</p><p></p><p>The broken Zhan Xu trembled as it flew back towards Lu Changsheng.</p><p></p><p>Lu Changsheng casually waved his sleeve, retrieving the broken Zhan Xu, his expression unchanged.</p><p></p><p>He only looked at the palm-sized Ancestral Seal with a rather peculiar gaze.</p><p></p><p>At this moment, the Ancestral Seal erupted with an extremely dazzling light again, forming a barrier that stretched for millions of miles, shielding the entire Ancient Desolate Sword Clan within!</p><p></p><p>It actually withstood the sword shadows falling like the Milky Way in a short time!</p><p></p><p>"Clang, clang, clang, clang, clang...!"</p><p></p><p>The sound of the sword shadows striking the barrier reverberated through the heavens and earth, and the Ancient Desolate Sword Clan suddenly burst into cheers!</p><p></p><p>At the same time,</p><p></p><p>The many powerful onlookers from afar were dumbfounded, not expecting the Ancient Desolate Sword Clan to be able to withstand this as well.</p><p></p><p>They truly lived up to their reputation as one of the Eight Ancient Clans, with profound foundations and endless surprises!</p><p></p><p>"Hahaha, Lu Changsheng! You think it's that easy to destroy my Ancient Desolate Sword Clan? Do you think it's over? In a short time, you've killed half of my clan's disciples, and you must pay a heavy price for that!!"</p><p></p><p>At this moment, the Venerable Sword Ancestor's booming laughter and roar echoed from afar.</p><p></p><p>But his smile was somewhat weak and frenzied, indicating that the loss of half of his clan's disciples was also a heavy blow to him.</p><p></p><p>"Bang!"</p><p></p><p>Suddenly, the Ancestral Seal exploded and shattered!</p><p></p><p>A strange aura rippled through the heavens and earth, and countless dazzling particles appeared, slowly forming the figure of a middle-aged man...</p><p></p><p>Lu Changsheng looked at the middle-aged figure, his brows slightly raised, feeling quite surprised, and his mood kept getting better. This Ancient Desolate Sword Clan really had quite a few tricks up their sleeve, hehe...</p><p></p><p>The Venerable Sword Ancestor and the others looked at the appearing middle-aged figure without surprise. They were teary-eyed and knelt down:</p><p></p><p>"We, the unfilial disciples, pay our respects to the Ancestor!"</p><p></p><p>The various executives and talented disciples of the Ancient Desolate Sword Clan were bewildered, but they also knelt down following the Ancestor and the Clan Leaders.</p><p></p><p>At the peak of the heavens, the middle-aged ethereal figure gradually solidified, becoming almost tangible. He wore ordinary white robes, without any imposing aura, giving a sense of refined politeness and a return to simplicity.</p><p></p><p>The middle-aged man did not pay attention to the kneeling Ancient Desolate Sword Clan disciples below, but instead looked at Lu Changsheng and cupped his hands in salute:</p><p></p><p>"Exterminator Sword Venerable, Sword Wuhui."</p><p></p><p>Lu Changsheng's eyes flickered for a moment, and he slowly clasped his hands behind his back, softly saying, "Lu Changsheng."</p><p></p><p>Exterminator Sword Venerable!</p><p></p><p>Whether it was the Ancient Desolate Sword Clan members or Li Shuyan and the distant onlookers, they were all shaken.</p><p></p><p>After all, this title sounded so domineering!</p><p></p><p>Sword Wuhui cupped his hands and said, "Young friend Lu, the Ancient Desolate Sword Clan was established by me in this realm long ago. I don't know how these unfilial descendants have offended you? Do you intend to exterminate the clan?"</p><p></p><p>The crowd was shocked again. The many bewildered disciples of the Ancient Desolate Sword Clan had their eyes burning with intensity at this moment!</p><p></p><p>No wonder the Clan Elders and Leaders were so respectful towards this middle-aged man!</p><p></p><p>It turned out that... he was the very first Ancestor who established their Ancient Desolate Sword Clan!</p>

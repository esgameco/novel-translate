        <h1>Chapter 315</h1>
        <div class="content">
            <p>Here is the full English translation of the Chinese excerpt:</p><p></p><p>The supreme existence of the ancient wasteland, the ancient Wasteland Sword Clan, has truly been annihilated. üëªüê∏Ôºñ‚ûàùî∞ƒ§ùêÆ–ñ.ƒÜ·óù‚ìÇ‚ô®üêØ</p><p></p><p>The crowd felt as if they were in a dream, feeling so unreal.</p><p></p><p>But the endless ruins that were still emitting white smoke in front of them were real, </p><p></p><p>they had witnessed the ancient Wasteland Sword Clan being destroyed with a single palm strike, they could not deny what they had seen.</p><p></p><p>Lu Changsheng looked at the ruins below for a moment, then suddenly raised his gaze to the many cultivators observing from afar.</p><p></p><p>This one glance frightened the souls of the crowd, they hurriedly knelt down in the air, not daring to raise their heads, showing their submission.</p><p></p><p>Lu Changsheng looked at Li Shuyan and the others, and with a wave of his sleeve, he took them away from this space.</p><p></p><p>The many powerful onlookers finally let out a long sigh of relief, some were so weak that they almost fell from the high ground.</p><p></p><p>"The ancient Wasteland Sword Clan, which has always been mysterious and never seen before, unexpectedly met with the fate of annihilation as soon as they appeared..."</p><p></p><p>Someone murmured absentmindedly while surveying the ruins.</p><p></p><p>.........</p><p></p><p>Ancient Wasteland Royal City.</p><p></p><p>Suddenly, a rift opened in space, and Nangong Wenxin, Lai Qing, and the other six supreme cultivators were thrown out.</p><p></p><p>The seven were thrown towards the city lord's mansion, and they barely stabilized their forms just as they were about to hit the ground. They looked at each other with lingering fear and terror on their faces.</p><p></p><p>The city guards tensed up, initially wanting to apprehend the intruders, but were stunned to find that the people in front of them were none other than the supreme cultivators who had recently gone to the ancient Wasteland Sword Clan after the Heavenly Monarch Assembly.</p><p></p><p>How did they come back? What had happened?</p><p></p><p>At this moment, Duan Jiuniong suddenly appeared here, also looking puzzled at Nangong Wenxin and the others.</p><p></p><p>"City Lord," the guards hurriedly paid their respects.</p><p></p><p>Duan Jiuniong casually waved his hand, then walked over, sweeping his gaze over the crowd, and couldn't help but frown when he found them all dazed.</p><p></p><p>"Hmm? Nangong Wenxin, Lai Qing? What's the situation? Didn't you go to the ancient Wasteland Sword Clan?"</p><p></p><p>Nangong Wenxin and Lai Qing, as well as the others, seemed to have not heard him at all, still standing there dazedly, as if in a trance.</p><p></p><p>Duan Jiuniong narrowed his eyes, his voice tinged with a hint of spiritual power, and he sternly commanded, "Wake up!"</p><p></p><p>The supreme cultivators were immediately jolted, and they snapped out of their daze, looking at Duan Jiuniong, who had suddenly appeared before them, with astonishment, and hurriedly bowed, stammering:</p><p></p><p>"We, we greet the City Lord."</p><p></p><p>"Hmm." Duan Jiuniong's expression finally softened a bit, after all, the forces behind these seven supreme cultivators were top-tier, so he didn't want to put too much pressure on them. He then asked, "Wenxin, Lai Qing, what is this about..."</p><p></p><p>Nangong Wenxin and the others naturally knew what Duan Jiuniong meant, but they just...</p><p></p><p>Nangong Wenxin looked at Lai Qing and the others, but found them looking at him, obviously wanting him to be the one to speak. He took a deep breath and said in a hoarse voice, "City Lord, the ancient Wasteland Sword Clan is no more..."</p><p></p><p>"Hmm, no more." Duan Jiuniong nodded absentmindedly, then suddenly his heart skipped a beat, his pupils constricting, and his voice abruptly rose by eight degrees: "What do you mean no more?!"</p><p></p><p>Nangong Wenxin's lips trembled, and he stammered:</p><p></p><p>"The, the ancient Wasteland Sword Clan was reduced to ruins by that senior... with a single palm strike. All the clan, including the Sword Ancestor, the Sword Clan Leader, the Elders, the Six Great Sword Masters, these nine Dao Realm experts, as well as hundreds of Spiritual Storehouse Realm guardians and protectors, and countless Sword Clan disciples, they all... died..."</p><p></p><p>Outside the city lord's mansion, it fell silent, the city guards staring blankly, swallowing hard.</p><p></p><p>Duan Jiuniong also lost his composure for a moment, then licked his dry lips and forced a smile, saying, "You must be joking..."</p><p></p><p>Here is the full English translation of the Chinese excerpt:</p><p></p><p>"Are you saying that your cultivation is low, and you were driven out by the Ancient Desolate Sword Clan?" </p><p></p><p>It's quite possible, after all, earlier at the plaza, that senior in the blue robe had slashed away everyone's cultivation.</p><p></p><p>Even Nangong Qinxin and Lai Qing, who were originally at the mid-stage of the Divine Yang Realm, had their cultivation reduced to the early-stage of the Divine Yang Realm.</p><p></p><p>Seeing that Duan Jiu Xiong didn't seem to believe them, Nangong Qinxin and the others felt a bit anxious, because what they were saying was the truth!</p><p></p><p>But they also understood Duan Jiu Xiong, for if one hadn't witnessed it with their own eyes, it would be hard for anyone to believe, after all, the Ancient Desolate Sword Clan was an invincible existence in the hearts of everyone in the Ancient Desolate Ruins.</p><p></p><p>Now, for someone to say the Ancient Desolate Sword Clan has been destroyed, it's already a miracle they weren't considered insane.</p><p></p><p>But just then, </p><p></p><p>countless transmissions came rushing towards the Ancient Desolate Royal City, dense like wireless telegrams, with the general content being:</p><p></p><p>"The Ancient Desolate Sword Clan has been annihilated by a mysterious blue-robed sword cultivator."</p><p></p><p>Including Duan Jiu Xiong, Miu Han Tian, and the Clan Leaders of the various major clans, they were all dumbfounded on the spot.</p><p></p><p>In just a moment, the entire Ancient Desolate Royal City was in an uproar.</p><p></p><p>Countless streams of light shot out from the Royal City, disappearing into the void, frantically rushing towards the direction mentioned in the transmissions!</p><p></p><p>Such an inconceivable event, they had to go see it for themselves, for if they didn't witness it with their own eyes, they would never dare to believe it, hearing is false, seeing is true!</p><p></p><p>Duan Jiu Xiong also left with a ghastly pale face, directly abandoning Nangong Qinxin and the others, having no time to inquire about anything else.</p><p></p><p>...</p><p></p><p>The Ancient Desolate Ruins had never been so tumultuous before, it can be said that countless powerful experts were rushing towards the same place, not even the Grand Celestial Assembly on that day was this dramatic.</p><p></p><p>The reason being, this matter was too significant and complex!</p><p></p><p>If the Ancient Desolate Sword Clan was truly annihilated, then the Ancient Desolate Ruins would be easily conquered by other regions of the Eternal Celestial Domain, such as the Moon Star Realm, the Fallen Immortal Continent, and so on.</p><p></p><p>Because without the restraint of the Ancient Desolate Sword Clan, the Ancient Desolate Ruins would be an unoccupied fertile land.</p><p></p><p>When Duan Jiu Xiong, Miu Han Tian, Nangong Clan Leader, and the others arrived at the Ancient Desolate Sword Clan, they looked at the scene before them with a lost and dejected expression.</p><p></p><p>The shocking bloodiness had not even dissipated yet, wafting in the wind, within their line of sight were severed limbs, shattered remains, and innards strewn everywhere.</p><p></p><p>"Ugh..."</p><p></p><p>From a high vantage point, they could imagine the scene of the blue-robed one slapping down with a palm...</p><p></p><p>What kind of palm strike was it, that even nine Dao Realm cultivators could not withstand, that the entire Ancient Desolate Sword Clan could not withstand...</p><p></p><p>The power of that single palm strike was not just about the destructive range, that was just a small aspect, the important thing was the might and mystery contained within.</p><p></p><p>...</p><p></p><p>On the flying ship, Fu Liang Cai, Liu Tu, and the others were seated in meditation. After the Grand Celestial Assembly ended, they had politely declined Miu Han Tian's invitation and were returning to the Shocking Cloud City.</p><p></p><p>"Ah, I wonder if Senior Lu has reached the Ancient Desolate Sword Clan yet, and how the situation is now."</p><p></p><p>Fu Liang Cai sighed with worry.</p><p></p><p>Fu Shi Yu and the others fell silent upon hearing this.</p><p></p><p>Senior Lu was indeed extremely powerful, but the Ancient Desolate Sword Clan was no pushover either, especially for them, the natives of the Ancient Desolate Ruins, the might of the Ancient Desolate Sword Clan was deeply etched in their hearts.</p><p></p><p>"Hm?"</p><p></p><p>Suddenly, Liu Tu furrowed his brows, taking out a jade token, and soon Miu Han Tian's urgent voice rang out: "Brother Liu, Brother Fu, you probably don't know yet? The Ancient Desolate Sword Clan has been annihilated by our senior!"</p><p></p><p>"..."</p><p></p><p>The expressions of those on the flying ship stiffened.</p>

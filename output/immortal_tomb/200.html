        <h1>Chapter 200</h1>
        <div class="content">
            <p>Here is the full English translation of the Chinese excerpt:</p><p></p><p>At the same time, in the distance on the horizon, the spiritual boat of the Xiaoyao Sect had also arrived.</p><p></p><p>The disciples were crowded at the railing, excitedly looking ahead, one after another:</p><p></p><p>"We've reached the Extreme Cold Glacier! Heavens, are all those densely packed... sects?!"</p><p></p><p>"I'm so excited, this is the first time I've experienced a scene like this! It feels like the competition will be fierce!"</p><p></p><p>"Hmph! The fierce competition is only for them. For us of the Xiaoyao Sect to enter this Extreme Cold Glacier is like wolves entering a flock of sheep!"</p><p></p><p>"No need to be so modest, all the nine-ranked sects combined are not enough for our Xiaoyao Sect to defeat!"</p><p></p><p>"......"</p><p></p><p>Listening to the disciples' discussions, </p><p></p><p>Elder Peng and the other five elders, as well as Protector Zhu Xingqiu, smiled without saying a word.</p><p></p><p>They did not come out to admonish them, telling them to be low-key and not underestimate others.</p><p></p><p>Because in their eyes, what the disciples said was simply the truth.</p><p></p><p>Since they had the strength, they could be arrogant.</p><p></p><p>How could the young not be arrogant? </p><p></p><p>Moreover, they were people of the Black Sha Domain, as long as there were no extremely powerful experts who could instantly subdue them (like a certain someone), they could be the most overbearing of all.</p><p></p><p>"Haha, everyone get ready, we'll be arriving soon," Elder Peng waved his chubby hand and said.</p><p></p><p>Hearing the words of the Grand Elder, everyone immediately fell silent.</p><p></p><p>Soon, the flying ship suddenly tilted and plunged downwards.</p><p></p><p>...</p><p></p><p>The arrival of the Xiaoyao Sect did not alarm any of the other sects.</p><p></p><p>After all, there were simply too many sects here, and more than a hundred sects had come with them, so no one had the energy to pay attention.</p><p></p><p>The members of the Xiaoyao Sect stood quietly in a corner, very obediently.</p><p></p><p>The expressions of the disciples were diverse, but no one spoke, only frantically transmitting voice messages.</p><p></p><p>"Shidi, it's so much fun following the senior, if I had followed the taciturn Shifu, where would I have such a good time?" Tongxin's face was filled with excitement as he transmitted to Lin Dong beside him.</p><p></p><p>Lin Dong's mouth twitched, helplessly rubbing his forehead: "Shixiong, two and a half years ago, didn't you say you wanted to curb your playful nature? Why have you started again... and you're still talking badly about Shifu behind his back."</p><p></p><p>Tongxin was stunned: "Did I say that?"</p><p></p><p>Lin Dong: "...No, I might have heard wrong."</p><p></p><p>The crowd exchanged voice messages in a casual manner, </p><p></p><p>unaware that by sheer coincidence, the Blood Flame Pavilion was not far from their Xiaoyao Sect...</p><p></p><p>In such a vast place, to run into each other, it could only be described as fate.</p><p></p><p>At this time, on the Blood Flame Pavilion side,</p><p></p><p>Elder Chen He lazily glanced sideways, and then his expression froze. Who did he see?</p><p></p><p>He saw the proctor of that day's Xiaoyao Sect examination, the presumed Sect Master of the Xiaoyao Sect - Zhu Xingqiu!</p><p></p><p>But how could this be? Wasn't he the Sect Master? Why was he standing in the third row?</p><p></p><p>The leader of the Xiaoyao Sect was actually a fat man? Could it be that this fat man was the true Sect Master of the Xiaoyao Sect?</p><p></p><p>Chen He pondered for a moment, and still decided to inform the Pavilion Master Fan Hong, who was meditating in front.</p><p></p><p>"Pavilion Master, it's the Xiaoyao Sect!"</p><p></p><p>Huh? What sect?</p><p></p><p>Fan Hong was startled, opening his eyes and turning around, looking puzzled at Chen He.</p><p></p><p>Chen He's gaze was solemn, tilting his head slightly to indicate.</p><p></p><p>Seeing this, Fan Hong turned his head to look, and his gaze immediately sharpened.</p><p></p><p>So this was the Xiaoyao Sect?</p><p></p><p>He scrutinized the fat man who was obviously the Sect Master, and the more he looked, the more his gaze became serious.</p><p></p><p>This Xiaoyao Sect Master, he actually couldn't see through him...</p><p></p><p>It seems this Xiaoyao Sect really has some substance to it.</p><p></p><p>Fan Hong quickly withdrew his gaze, afraid of attracting the attention of the Xiaoyao Sect.</p><p></p><p>Now in this Extreme Cold Glacier, there were too many sects, it was not appropriate to establish an opponent without reason!</p><p></p><p>"There are too many sects here, let's not bother with them for now. When we reach the Extreme Cold Glacier, if we encounter the Xiaoyao Sect again, we'll deal with it then," Fan Hong said in a calm voice.</p><p></p><p>Hearing this, Chen He expressed his full agreement.</p><p></p><p>They did not know that while Fan Hong was probing Peng Fang, Peng Fang had already noticed, and he looked puzzled at the Blood Flame Pavilion's Fan Hong.</p><p></p><p>Here is the full English translation of the Chinese excerpt:</p><p></p><p>The people... hmm... don't recognize them.</p><p></p><p>New 69 Book Bar 99 SHUX.COM</p><p></p><p>Dong!!!! </p><p></p><p>Just then, a sudden bell sound exploded in the vast, icy expanse above.</p><p></p><p>Immediately, all the sects were stirred up, with countless gazes turning towards the sky.</p><p></p><p>The great sifting before the grand competition was about to begin!!</p><p></p><p>Shortly after, an aged voice resounded from the sky, a series of ringing words descending from the heavens,</p><p></p><p>"I presume the rules are clear, at this moment, all ninth-rank sects shall rush towards the central region of the Extreme Cold Glacier! Time limit of two and a half months, past the deadline... the qualification for the grand competition will be void!"</p><p></p><p>"The countdown begins."</p><p></p><p>... A moment of silence in heaven and earth.</p><p></p><p>The next instant, countless sects suddenly converged towards the center of the Extreme Cold Glacier, surging forth like a torrent crossing a river!</p><p></p><p>Upon entering the Extreme Cold Glacier, one could immediately feel the biting cold invading their body, and they hastily activated their immortal qi to resist it!</p><p></p><p>And at this moment!</p><p></p><p>Boom!!</p><p></p><p>Suddenly, surging immortal qi whipped up the frigid air, and all kinds of bizarre techniques flashed like countless stars in the sky!</p><p></p><p>Just as they had entered the Extreme Cold Glacier, without even delving too deep, a small number of sects, either due to enmity or sneak attacks, directly engaged in fierce combat!</p><p></p><p>Chaos and mayhem erupted without warning,</p><p></p><p>Sounds of slaughter and agonizing screams reverberated, the scene descending into utter pandemonium.</p><p></p><p>In just a moment, tens of thousands of sect disciples had fallen into eternal slumber.</p><p></p><p>This sight left many sect elders and disciples trembling with fear!</p><p></p><p>It was too cruel.</p><p></p><p>But most sect masters maintained their composure, leading their disciples to desperately rush towards the depths of the Extreme Cold Glacier, hoping to escape this place.</p><p></p><p>After all, it was too chaotic here, and one could easily get dragged in if not careful.</p><p></p><p>Sects like the Blood Flame Pavilion also hastily retreated, not wanting to get entangled with any other sects at this time.</p><p></p><p>The fighting and mayhem continued for a while,</p><p></p><p>Until finally, it quieted down.</p><p></p><p>Countless ninth-rank sects, after collecting their dead, quickly vanished into the icy mist.</p><p></p><p>The isolated disciples of the Carefree Sect, still outside the Extreme Cold Glacier, had a somewhat dry throat.</p><p></p><p>The scene before them was a mountain of corpses and a sea of blood, the vast snowy ground dyed red, the pungent stench of blood assaulting their nostrils, not a pleasant smell at all.</p><p></p><p>It had just begun, yet at least hundreds of thousands of cultivators had already perished,</p><p></p><p>When did the lives of cultivators become so fragile...</p><p></p><p>"The strong survive, the weak perish! This has been the sole law of survival since ancient times, and the true survivors will be the strong, not the delicate flowers in the greenhouse!" Peng Fang said indifferently, then waved his hand, "Let's go."</p><p></p><p>"Yes!"</p><p></p><p>As the Carefree Sect members stepped on the blood-stained snow and disappeared into the mist of the glacier,</p><p></p><p>A figure in blue suddenly appeared out of thin air outside.</p><p></p><p>This person was none other than the elusive Sect Master Lu, the Dragon Seer.</p><p></p><p>Lu Changsheng looked at the scattered limbs and debris around him, then with his hands clasped behind his back, he casually strode into the Extreme Cold Glacier, his bearing leisurely and elegant, as if he were simply going for a stroll.</p><p></p><p>At the same moment, a streak of light suddenly plummeted from the sky,</p><p></p><p>But Lu Changsheng paid it no mind, continuing his unhurried steps into the glacier.</p><p></p><p>The next instant, a young man and woman appeared outside the glacier, with an old man and an old woman standing behind them.</p><p></p><p>"Huh?" </p><p></p><p>Lei Yu was surprised to see the icy mist in front of him, the figure in blue having vanished without a trace. He then said, "Who was that person just now? Alone by himself, he clearly didn't seem to be here for the grand competition. Could he have just come to watch the excitement?"</p><p></p><p>The two protectors did not respond, as they had only caught a glimpse of the young man, and he had disappeared too quickly for them to investigate further.</p><p></p><p>However, Lei Ting's eyes were shining with excitement as she said to her brother, "Brother, it seems a fierce battle has just taken place here. They've all gone in, so let's go in and have some fun too."</p><p></p><p>They rarely had the chance to go out and play, so this time they naturally couldn't let the opportunity slip by.</p><p></p><p>Hearing this, Lei Yu smiled and immediately pushed the previous matter to the back of his mind. He patted Lei Ting's head and said with a smile, "Alright, then let's go in."</p><p></p><p>Thereafter, the four of them stepped onto the blood-stained snow and entered the Extreme Cold Glacier.</p><p></p><p>Faced with the piles of severed limbs and debris on the ground, their expressions remained completely unfazed.</p><p></p><p>After all, they were from the First-Rank Sect, the Great Thunder Sect. What kind of scene had they not witnessed before?</p>

        <h1>Chapter 139</h1>
        <div class="content">
            <p>Here is the full English translation of the Chinese excerpt:</p><p></p><p>At the entrance of the Divine Path. ‚Ü§‚Ü§‚Ü§‚Ü§‚Ü§ ‚ûÖÔºôùìºÔΩà«óùîµ.Âåö„Ññ–º ‚Ü¶‚Ü¶‚Ü¶‚Ü¶‚Ü¶</p><p></p><p>Lu Changsheng stood at the forefront.</p><p></p><p>The crowd looked at the entrance of the Divine Path, which was a dilapidated large gate, with densely engraved markings on it, all of which were flickering with colorful lights, swirling with some mysterious hues.</p><p></p><p>Next to the gate, there stood a transparent pillar.</p><p></p><p>The crowd was not new to the Divine Path, and they were very familiar with the procedure.</p><p></p><p>To open this dilapidated gate, one only needed to input their immortal essence. As long as the transparent pillar emitted a purple glow, it would signify that the one attempting the Divine Path had reached the pinnacle of the Four Directions Immortal Realm, and the Divine Path would then open.</p><p></p><p>Conversely, if the pillar did not react, the gate would not open.</p><p></p><p>The expression on Ancient Yin-Yang's face slightly changed...</p><p></p><p>Shi Wushi noticed his expression and asked puzzledly, "Yin-Yang, what's wrong?"</p><p></p><p>Ancient Yin-Yang looked at the transparent pillar and said hoarsely, "I forgot about this. I only have a few months of lifespan left, so I probably don't have the qualifications to enter the Divine Path."</p><p></p><p>Huh? A few months of lifespan?</p><p></p><p>The Snow Ball Clan Leader and Snow Tower were taken aback, and they then closely examined Ancient Yin-Yang, only to find that the vitality within him was indeed dwindling...</p><p></p><p>"This..." Shi Wushi hurriedly looked at Lu Changsheng, asking hopefully, "Immortal Emperor Changsheng, do you have a way?"</p><p></p><p>Among them, Lu Changsheng was the most mysterious and powerful, so if anyone could do something, it would undoubtedly be him.</p><p></p><p>The crowd also looked at Lu Changsheng.</p><p></p><p>Lu Changsheng looked at the transparent pillar and said, "Yin-Yang, you try first."</p><p></p><p>"Mm."</p><p></p><p>Ancient Yin-Yang walked up to the transparent pillar, activated his immortal essence power, and then slammed his palm onto the pillar!</p><p></p><p>The next moment, the pillar flickered with a faint purple glow, but it only lasted for an instant, and the gate only trembled slightly before the movement subsided.</p><p></p><p>Ancient Yin-Yang immediately became dejected.</p><p></p><p>As expected.</p><p></p><p>"How about we try to forcefully break open the Divine Path gate together!"</p><p></p><p>Chu LingtiƒÅn said in a solemn voice.</p><p></p><p>Shi Wushi and the others were somewhat tempted by this suggestion.</p><p></p><p>Old Turtle sneered, "That won't work, you idiots. The Divine Path gate is established by the Heavenly Dao of the Four Directions Immortal Realm. With just you few Immortal Emperors, you think you can break it open?"</p><p></p><p>Shi Wushi discreetly glanced at Lu Changsheng and then said awkwardly, "But we should at least try... otherwise, Yin-Yang..."</p><p></p><p>"Then you can go ahead and try," Lu Changsheng said with a smile.</p><p></p><p>"Alright, Immortal Emperor Changsheng, you step back and let us try." </p><p></p><p>Chu LingtiƒÅn immediately rolled up his sleeves and said.</p><p></p><p>To be honest, they should do something themselves, not always relying on Lu Changsheng. Otherwise, when they went to the Ancestral Heavenly Realm, and Lu Changsheng was not there, would they not be able to survive?</p><p></p><p>Lu Changsheng nodded slightly and took a step back.</p><p></p><p>Old Turtle snorted disdainfully and also took a step back, inwardly cursing these people as big fools, as he had already said it was the Heavenly Dao of the Four Directions Immortal Realm, yet they still refused to believe it.</p><p></p><p>"Snow Tower, let's help too, and see if we can break open the Divine Path gate."</p><p></p><p>The Snow Ball Clan Leader looked at Snow Tower and instructed.</p><p></p><p>"Understood." Snow Tower naturally agreed.</p><p></p><p>Soon, </p><p></p><p>Chu LingtiƒÅn, Feng Nine, Shi Wushi, Ancient Yin-Yang, Snow Tower, and the Snow Ball Clan Leader lined up.</p><p></p><p>They stared at the Divine Path gate with solemn expressions.</p><p></p><p>They knew in their hearts that the Divine Path gate was extremely sturdy, but since they were six Immortal Emperor-level experts gathered here, they should be able to shake this gate!</p><p></p><p>As Immortal Emperor-level experts, they also had a certain sense of pride.</p><p></p><p>The next moment, the six of them vigorously activated their immortal essence power, causing the heavens and earth to tremble!</p><p></p><p>The extremely dense immortal essence power compressed this space, making the space tremble with the threat of shattering!</p><p></p><p>As the immortal essence power was cultivated, the immortal essence in the heavens and earth reached a terrifying level, surging to the extreme!</p><p></p><p>"Gathering our six immortal essences, let's unite our strength to break open the Divine Path gate!"</p><p></p><p>Here is the full English translation of the Chinese excerpt:</p><p></p><p>"Boom!! The gate!" </p><p></p><p>Chu Lingian let out a fierce shout.</p><p></p><p>"Hah!"</p><p></p><p>Immediately, everyone began to focus their immortal energy and unleash it towards the Divine Path Gate in unison!</p><p></p><p>Rumble rumble rumble!!!</p><p></p><p>Surging immortal energy, like the waters of a celestial river, rushed towards the Divine Path Gate with towering force!</p><p></p><p>At first glance, it seemed that under such an assault, the Divine Path Gate would be shattered into pieces in an instant!</p><p></p><p>But...</p><p></p><p>"Thud."</p><p></p><p>A sound like a chess piece falling onto the board resounded.</p><p></p><p>They stared dumbfoundedly as the Divine Path Gate, under the overwhelming barrage, did not even sway a bit...</p><p></p><p>That single "thud" was a blatant insult to their efforts.</p><p></p><p>"This..." </p><p></p><p>The crowd was embarrassed.</p><p></p><p>Especially with Lu Changsheng and the Old Turtle watching nearby, they were utterly mortified!</p><p></p><p>"Hehe hehe, I told you this is the doing of the Heavenly Dao of the Four Realms, yet you still didn't believe me. How could you possibly contend with the Heavenly Dao?" </p><p></p><p>The Old Turtle mocked mercilessly.</p><p></p><p>The crowd felt awkward and all turned to look at Lu Changsheng.</p><p></p><p>Lu Changsheng tilted his head and looked at the Old Turtle, saying meaningfully, "If you're so capable, then you try it."</p><p></p><p>The Old Turtle immediately fell silent, unable to speak.</p><p></p><p>Although he was more powerful than the likes of Chu Lingian, the Heavenly Dao of the Four Realms was still beyond his ability to contend with.</p><p></p><p>The Old Turtle embarrassedly chuckled using his usual excuse, "Master, the Old Turtle specializes in defense, not in offense..."</p><p></p><p>Lu Changsheng had expected him to say that, so he didn't bother responding further.</p><p></p><p>Under the hopeful gazes of the crowd, he stepped forward.</p><p></p><p>Then, with a light flick of his finger...</p><p></p><p>Though no visible movement occurred...</p><p></p><p>Boom‚Äî!</p><p></p><p>The Divine Path Gate collapsed with a thunderous crash!!</p><p></p><p>The crowd: "..."</p><p></p><p>At the same time, </p><p></p><p>the Heavenly Dao of the Four Realms shook violently, gazing towards the Divine Path, and let out a long sigh.</p><p></p><p>"Immortal Emperor Changsheng, you really know how to stir up trouble... Oh well, I'll just have to rebuild it later."</p><p></p><p>...</p><p></p><p>"Alright, from now on, just follow behind me. We'll advance at the fastest pace."</p><p></p><p>Lu Changsheng said indifferently, striding into the Divine Path.</p><p></p><p>The crowd snapped out of their daze, glancing at each other, then obediently followed behind him.</p><p></p><p>On the first level, five mechanical beasts appeared, their bodies clanking loudly, their scarlet eyes filled with murderous intent!</p><p></p><p>Chu Lingian and the others tensed up slightly, their hands unconsciously poised to attack!</p><p></p><p>The mechanisms on the Divine Path were ever-changing, a type of trial they had never encountered before, even after traversing the Divine Path numerous times.</p><p></p><p>Just as they were thinking about it, Lu Changsheng casually struck out with a palm.</p><p></p><p>Boom!!!</p><p></p><p>In the blink of an eye, the five mechanical beasts were reduced to scrap metal before their bewildered eyes.</p><p></p><p>"No need to waste time on this junk." </p><p></p><p>Lu Changsheng said indifferently, stepping over the scrap and continuing forward.</p><p></p><p>After that, </p><p></p><p>various mazes, traps, killing formations, poisonous substances, bizarre flames, and corrosive mists, etc. etc...</p><p></p><p>All of them crumbled under the light taps and punches of Lu Changsheng.</p><p></p><p>Chu Lingian and the others were completely numb by this point!</p><p></p><p>The Snow Tower and Snow Ball Clan Elders had also gone from awe to shivering in fear!</p><p></p><p>This azure-robed cultivator was simply a monster!!</p><p></p><p>Utterly terrifying!!</p>

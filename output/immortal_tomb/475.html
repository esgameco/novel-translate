        <h1>Chapter 475</h1>
        <div class="content">
            <p>Here is the full English translation of the Chinese excerpt:</p><p></p><p>It didn't take long for Xiao Chai to react.</p><p></p><p>In the three thousand Dharma realms, are there still people who don't know why they need to comprehend the Dharma laws in the Sea of Dharma Laws?</p><p></p><p>As if sensing Xiao Chai's confusion, Lu Changsheng smiled and said, "I grew up in a mountain ravine all this time, and have only recently come out to temper myself."</p><p></p><p>Upon hearing this, not only Xiao Chai, even the slightly slower Chen Pang found it hard to believe.</p><p></p><p>This Dharma companion Lu looked so transcendent and aloof, how could he be from a mountain ravine?</p><p></p><p>Of course, Xiao Chai and Chen Pang wouldn't expose him. In the world of cultivators, telling lies when going out is the norm. Only a complete fool would blurt out the whole truth, and such a fool probably wouldn't last long.</p><p></p><p>"I see." Xiao Chai smiled and then pondered for a moment before explaining:</p><p></p><p>"Lu Companion, you don't know this, but there's actually no requirement that one must comprehend the Dharma laws in the Sea of Dharma Laws. But if you don't go to the Sea of Dharma Laws and try to comprehend it on your own, the Dharma laws you comprehend will most likely be... very weak. That's why cultivators risk great danger to go to the Sea of Dharma Laws - they want to comprehend more powerful Dharma laws."</p><p></p><p>"And why is it called the Sea of Dharma Laws? The meaning is self-evident, Companion should understand."</p><p></p><p>Lu Changsheng nodded lightly. These were things not present in Chu Yao's memories, which was strange.</p><p></p><p>"Okay, I understand, thank you." Lu Changsheng cupped his hands politely.</p><p></p><p>Xiao Chai hurriedly waved his hand: "Companion, don't be so polite, it's nothing..."</p><p></p><p>Lu Changsheng smiled, then leaned against the railing and closed his eyes to rest.</p><p></p><p>Seeing this, Chen Pang and Xiao Chai didn't disturb him. The two stood up and looked towards the distant horizon.</p><p></p><p>"Big brother, take out the sea chart and see how long it will take to truly enter the Sea of Dharma Laws?"</p><p></p><p>Chen Pang said, bored.</p><p></p><p>"What's the rush, we just set sail not long ago, we're definitely still early." </p><p></p><p>Although Xiao Chai said this, he still took out the sea chart and spread it open. Seeing this, Chen Pang quickly came over.</p><p></p><p>Xiao Chai pointed to a spot on the chart and said, "We should be around here now, and the Sea of Dharma Laws is..."</p><p></p><p>As he spoke, Xiao Chai's fingertip slid along the route, finally stopping on a large red dot: "The Sea of Dharma Laws is here."</p><p></p><p>Chen Pang exclaimed with a bitter face, "That far? It'll take hundreds of years to get there, won't it?"</p><p></p><p>Xiao Chai put away the sea chart and glanced at the many figures on the deck who had entered a state of cultivation, saying impatiently, "Can't you see they've already started cultivating? Isn't that precisely to refine time? With cultivation, even hundreds of years will just be the blink of an eye."</p><p></p><p>"Alright, then we'll cultivate too, otherwise we won't be able to endure it."</p><p></p><p>Chen Pang muttered and sat down, glancing at the opposite Lu Changsheng, then closed his eyes and entered a state of cultivation.</p><p></p><p>Seeing Chen Pang start cultivating, Xiao Chai took out the sea chart again, his gaze fixed intently on the dense dots of light around the route in a certain sea area...</p><p></p><p>These dots of light symbolized danger!</p><p></p><p>"Sigh, I hope this journey will be smooth sailing all the way..."</p><p></p><p>Xiao Chai put away the sea chart, sat down and crossed his legs, also entering a state of cultivation.</p><p></p><p>Except for the faint rumbling and whistling of the wind, there was no other sound on the entire ship, and the deck had long since fallen silent.</p><p></p><p>...</p><p></p><p>Time passes without age.</p><p></p><p>In the blink of an eye, fifty years had gone by.</p><p></p><p>The ship was still sailing on the sea surface at an extremely fast speed, as if it would never stop.</p><p></p><p>On the deck, the cultivators were still sitting in a petrified state, motionless.</p><p></p><p>Time flowed second by second.</p><p></p><p>Suddenly, Lu Changsheng slowly opened his eyes, rising to his feet and looking out towards the horizon.</p><p></p><p>The once calm sea surface had already begun to show faint waves.</p><p></p><p>Lu Changsheng lowered his head, the blue light flickering in his pupils, then raised his head again to look far, far into the distance, and saw nine huge ships looming out of the mist, heading towards where he was.</p><p></p><p>Lu Changsheng smiled slightly, then sat back down, glancing at the cultivating Chen Pang and Xiao Chai.</p><p></p><p>Here is the full English translation of the Chinese excerpt:</p><p></p><p>He closed his eyes again to cultivate his spirit.</p><p></p><p>In this way, another ten years passed.</p><p></p><p>"Wuwuwuwu——!"</p><p></p><p>On this day, in the dead of night, the urgent ship horn suddenly sounded!</p><p></p><p>In just an instant, all the cultivators on the ship were awakened, getting up one by one, looking at each other in bewilderment!</p><p></p><p>"Eh, big brother, what's happening?"</p><p></p><p>Chen Pang quickly came out of his cultivation state, got up, patted his butt, and asked the equally confused Xiao Chai.</p><p></p><p>"Everyone, pay attention, there are demonic cultivators approaching from the sea, there are demonic cultivators approaching from the sea!!"</p><p></p><p>At this moment, the captain's shout rang out.</p><p></p><p>The cultivators immediately tensed up, they looked towards the dark sea surface, their eyes becoming anxious!</p><p></p><p>Demonic cultivators from the sea...!</p><p></p><p>It's over, it's over! It seems we've really encountered danger......</p><p></p><p>"Oh no, big brother, it's the demonic cultivators from the sea! Our luck is really too bad, you see, I said we shouldn't come to the Sea of Principles, now we're going to die."</p><p></p><p>Chen Pang's face turned pale as he spoke.</p><p></p><p>Xiao Chai's expression wasn't too good either, but he forced a smile and said, "Fatty, we might not necessarily die, I've heard that the demonic cultivators from the sea usually only rob people of their wealth..."</p><p></p><p>"What are the demonic cultivators from the sea?"</p><p></p><p>At this time, Lu Changsheng opened his eyes and asked with a smile.</p><p></p><p>Xiao Chai and Chen Pang saw that Lu Changsheng could still smile, and they were stunned for a moment, but they also didn't know if they were affected by it, and the fear and tension in their hearts subsided a bit.</p><p></p><p>Xiao Chai pursed his lips and explained, "Fellow Daoist Lu, the demonic cultivators from the sea, in simple terms, are actually pirates. They usually operate on the routes leading to the Sea of Principles, robbing the passing ships."</p><p></p><p>Lu Changsheng nodded slightly, indicating that he understood.</p><p></p><p>At this moment, the ship suddenly started rocking, being hit by continuous huge waves!</p><p></p><p>In the dark mist, nine huge ship silhouettes slowly approached, exuding a strong sense of oppression!</p><p></p><p>This scene directly scared the group of cultivators shitless!</p><p></p><p>Nine ships, a total of nine ships!</p><p></p><p>They had originally thought that they could still put up a fight against one or two ships, but nine ships!</p><p></p><p>There was no room for resistance at all!</p><p></p><p>At this moment, the cultivators could only tremble on their legs, watching the nine ships approach helplessly!</p><p></p><p>As for other options, they couldn't do anything else, staying on the ship still had a slim chance of survival, jumping into the sea or fleeing through the air would be certain death!</p><p></p><p>Why did they all have to board the ship to the Sea of Principles? Of course, it was because whether it was the airspace above the sea or the sea below, there were countless dangers that could lead to their demise.</p><p></p><p>"You'd better let the ship stop, or else hehe......"</p><p></p><p>At this moment, a fierce voice came from the lead ship among the nine.</p><p></p><p>The hearts of the cultivators chilled, and they soon realized that the speed of the ship they were on had slowed down, until it came to a complete stop.</p><p></p><p>The captain and the crew were also afraid!</p><p></p><p>The next moment, the nine ships drew near and stopped, and then countless fierce and evil-looking figures leaped towards the ship, laughing wickedly!</p><p></p><p>"Haha, rob them all!"</p><p>"Hehe, ravish the women!"</p><p>"Hahaha, brothers, I see some good-looking ladies in that suite, I'll enjoy them first!"</p><p>"......"</p><p></p><p>On the ship, the group of cultivators turned deathly pale, facing a formidable enemy!</p><p></p><p>"Big, big brother, should we jump into the sea and escape? Staying here will definitely get us killed! Fellow Daoist Lu, will you jump into the sea with us?"</p><p>Chen Pang trembled in fear, not forgetting to look at Lu Changsheng.</p><p></p><p>"Staying here still has a chance of survival, jumping into the sea is certain death!" Xiao Chai shouted.</p><p></p><p>Jump into the sea?</p><p>Could Lu Changsheng do such a thing as jumping into the sea to escape? No matter how you look at it, it doesn't fit his style at all!</p><p></p><p>Lu Changsheng chuckled and comforted, "Don't be hasty, let's see what happens first, maybe there will be a turning point."</p>

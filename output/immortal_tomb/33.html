        <h1>Chapter 33</h1>
        <div class="content">
            <p>Here is the full English translation of the Chinese excerpt:</p><p></p><p>Outside the town of Moyu, in the sky above the forest.</p><p></p><p>The ancient crane in the forest suddenly paused and said, "Patriarch, Second Elder, could this be a ploy to lure the tiger out of the mountain?"</p><p></p><p>Shen Miaoyun and the Second Elder both hesitated for a moment.</p><p></p><p>They then realized that since the demonic realm had failed to invade the Lishui Empire last time, they might now be targeting the neighboring secular empires as a stratagem.</p><p></p><p>But that was not the main point.</p><p></p><p>The most important thing was that they knew this was a ploy, yet they had no choice but to go.</p><p></p><p>This was a fatal flaw in the cultivation world.</p><p></p><p>The common people living in the mortal realm were easily used as a breach by the demonic and evil realms.</p><p></p><p>The cultivators would have their hands tied.</p><p></p><p>But the demonic and evil realms had no such qualms, as they could mobilize all their demonic forces without any reservations.</p><p></p><p>Shen Miaoyun said indifferently, "Even if this is a ploy, what countermeasures do we have? If we are too late, not only will the common people suffer heavy casualties, but even the foundation disciples of our Qingyan Sect may sustain significant losses."</p><p></p><p>The Second Elder remained silent beside her.</p><p></p><p>"Moreover, don't we have that cultivator guarding this place? What do we have to fear?" Shen Miaoyun continued.</p><p></p><p>The expression on Gu Helin's face changed slightly as he said dryly, "Patriarch, Lishui is under the jurisdiction of our Qingyan Sect, and protecting these common people is our responsibility. To put it bluntly, this has little to do with the senior. If the demonic forces invade and the senior does not intervene... I'm afraid..."</p><p></p><p>Gu Helin was a bit unsure about Lucheng's character.</p><p></p><p>"Insolent!" Shen Miaoyun reprimanded in a cold tone, looking at Gu Helin. "Even if this place is under our Qingyan Sect's jurisdiction, can't he, as a cultivator, save those in peril? Our sect does not believe there is such a callous person in this world!"</p><p></p><p>"You have called him a senior, and said that he can easily slay five demonic beasts on par with Golden Core cultivators with a wave of his hand. Judging from your account, our sect acknowledges his abilities. The greater the ability, the greater the responsibility - is this not reasonable? Which of us cultivators did not come from the common people and embark on this long cultivation path?"</p><p></p><p>Just as Gu Helin was shaking his head and sighing, unable to refute, a faint voice like a thunderclap suddenly rang in the ears of the three, "So you dare to use moral leverage against me. How bold."</p><p></p><p>Gu Helin's expression changed - this was the voice of the senior, which he was all too familiar with!</p><p></p><p>Sure enough, in the next moment, a young man in blue robes appeared before the three like a ghost, his emotionless eyes staring directly at Shen Miaoyun.</p><p></p><p>The Perfected Being! </p><p></p><p>After just a moment of eye contact, Shen Miaoyun lowered her head, unable to meet his gaze, feeling a sense of suffocation in her chest.</p><p></p><p>As a late-stage Nascent Soul cultivator, she was just one small step away from the peak, which was the Perfected Being realm. She naturally knew that this kind of instantaneous teleportation could only be possessed by cultivators at the Perfected Being level or above.</p><p></p><p>"Senior..." Gu Helin hesitated, respectfully addressing him. This time, he felt somewhat flustered. The senior was usually amiable and approachable, but now he was indifferent and exuding a strong sense of oppression.</p><p></p><p>Could the senior be intending to kill the Patriarch?</p><p></p><p>Lucheng gently waved his hand, silencing Gu Helin.</p><p></p><p>He then continued to look at Shen Miaoyun with a faint gaze.</p><p></p><p>So he had been subjected to moral leverage? How interesting.</p><p></p><p>The Second Elder pursed his lips, lowering his head and not daring to speak. He finally understood why the old Gu was so respectful towards this senior. Even without anything else, just his aura alone was enough.</p><p></p><p>Shen Miaoyun was under immense pressure at the moment, and it was no exaggeration to say that her scalp was tingling.</p><p></p><p>However, as the Patriarch of the Qingyan Sect, with two Elders present, it was impossible for her to admit her mistake.</p><p></p><p>She also believed that what she had said was entirely reasonable, so how could she acknowledge her error? If she did, it would go against her inner thoughts and she might end up shackled, making it difficult to advance on the cultivation path in the future. This was something she did not wish to happen.</p><p></p><p>"Senior, our sect... I have not spoken wrongly," Shen Miaoyun mustered her courage to say, but it seemed to have exhausted all her strength, leaving her somewhat dispirited.</p><p></p><p>"Whether to save these common people or not, I know what I should do. It's not up to you, a minor cultivator, to lecture me."</p><p></p><p>Here is the full English translation of the Chinese excerpt:</p><p></p><p>"Don't stand on the moral high ground and judge others arbitrarily," said Lu Changsheng calmly.</p><p></p><p>The Elders Gu Helin and Er Laoling were a bit anxious beside them, wanting the Sect Master to quickly admit her mistake, as the senior's intention was quite obvious, right? He was basically going to save them!</p><p></p><p>Shen Miaojun gritted her teeth tightly and remained silent.</p><p></p><p>"Today, if you admit your mistake, I won't pursue this matter further with you," said Lu Changsheng, standing upright.</p><p></p><p>"Sect Master, you should just admit the mistake to the senior. This senior is capricious, you absolutely must not provoke him again..." urged the Elders Gu Helin and Er Laoling.</p><p></p><p>Sensing the atmosphere, Gu Helin and Er Laoling could no longer hold back and quickly transmitted their thoughts to Shen Miaojun.</p><p></p><p>"Isn't it commonly accepted that the strong have the right to speak? Why are you still being stubborn? What's more important than saving your life?"</p><p></p><p>This was the inner voice of Gu Helin and Er Laoling.</p><p></p><p>It was good that they didn't transmit their thoughts, but the moment they did, Shen Miaojun's face flushed with heat, and she became even more defiant!</p><p></p><p>"Senior, I have not said anything wrong. When the common people are in trouble, you with your towering abilities should have stepped in. We cultivators all come from the common people, we..."</p><p></p><p>Boom! </p><p></p><p>Before Shen Miaojun could finish speaking, a sea-like oppressive force descended upon her!! She coughed up a mouthful of fresh blood, her face deathly pale, looking at Lu Changsheng in terror.</p><p></p><p>The next moment, Shen Miaojun fell from the high sky!</p><p></p><p>"Sect Master!" </p><p></p><p>"Sect Master!"</p><p></p><p>After a moment, the bewildered Gu Helin and Er Laoling changed their appearance and rushed down, supporting the rapidly falling Shen Miaojun on either side, landing safely on the ground.</p><p></p><p>Shen Miaojun pushed the two away with difficulty, leaning against a tree and sitting down. The qi and blood in her chest were tumbling, pain and suffocation sweeping through her entire body! </p><p></p><p>She felt that she had almost died just now.</p><p></p><p>"Teacher? Sect Master? Elder Er?" </p><p></p><p>Coincidentally, the Foundation Establishment disciples like Tong Xin were present at the scene, their faces full of bewilderment.</p><p></p><p>Swoosh!</p><p></p><p>At this moment, Lu Changsheng appeared here and looked at Shen Miaojun, asking, "Do you understand now?"</p><p></p><p>Gu Helin and Er Laoling lowered their heads in silence. In fact, they didn't quite understand the Sect Master's initial words.</p><p></p><p>In this world, just do your best, why stand on the moral high ground and impose shackles on others?</p><p></p><p>Shen Miaojun trembled inwardly, and with difficulty, she stood up and bowed her head, saying, "Senior, I understand."</p><p></p><p>The disciples were already dumbfounded, feeling that their minds were full of porridge, as if something had been burned.</p><p></p><p>They completely couldn't understand what was going on, and who this suddenly appearing blue-robed man was, that the Sect Master even called him "senior"?</p><p></p><p>Only Tong Xin had a slight tremor in his body, although he didn't know what had happened, but of course he recognized Lu Changsheng.</p><p></p><p>"What do you understand?" Lu Changsheng asked.</p><p></p><p>"I, I take back those words, those words were all wrong..." </p><p></p><p>Before Shen Miaojun could finish, Lu Changsheng raised his hand to stop her, and at the same time, he glanced at Gu Helin.</p><p></p><p>The blue robe gradually dissipated.</p><p></p><p>"You still don't understand."</p><p></p><p>Shen Miaojun stared blankly at the place where the blue-robed figure had disappeared.</p><p></p><p>At this time, Gu Helin sighed inwardly, the senior was giving him face...</p><p></p><p>So he said, "Ah, Sect Master, the senior didn't mean anything from the beginning! He just wanted you to admit your mistake regarding the moral high ground issue."</p><p></p><p>Shen Miaojun was lost in thought for a long time before murmuring, "I was wrong..."</p>

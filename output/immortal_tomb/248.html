        <h1>Chapter 248</h1>
        <div class="content">
            <p>Here is the full English translation of the Chinese excerpt:</p><p></p><p>Jing Guan saw Luchang Sheng come and sit down at the long table. </p><p></p><p>He also reseated himself, waiting for the other's explanation.</p><p></p><p>Luchang Sheng poured himself a cup of tea, took a sip, and said, "Whether I can heal it or not is up to me."</p><p></p><p>Jing Guan fell silent.</p><p></p><p>He picked up the tea on the table and took a sip, but tasted only the utmost bitterness.</p><p></p><p>However, his expression did not change at all, as if he was still drinking it calmly one sip after another.</p><p></p><p>He looked up at Luchang Sheng, "Patron Luchang, are you not from the Ancestral Heavenly Deity Realm?"</p><p></p><p>Hearing this, the young Tongxin was slightly shocked, looking at Jing Guan with some disbelief, not understanding how this bald donkey could have figured it out.</p><p></p><p>Luchang Sheng was not surprised by this. He said indifferently, "If you want me to treat your illness, just get on with it. I don't have time to chat idly with you, I still have other matters to attend to."</p><p></p><p>Jing Guan paused, let out a sigh, and said, "Patron Luchang, I'm not afraid you'll laugh at me, but Jing Guan's illness of the heart is one of the seven emotions in the Buddhist and Taoist seven emotions and six desires - the emotion of love. All this time, whether it was quiet meditation or traveling thousands of miles to witness the sufferings of the world, I have not been able to break free from it."</p><p></p><p>"Does Patron Luchang have a good remedy to treat this illness of the heart?"</p><p></p><p>Luchang Sheng's eyes flickered slightly as he softly said, "You monk, are you not quite bright? All matters in the world have their reasons. If you don't start from the beginning, how can I prescribe a good remedy?"</p><p></p><p>Hearing this, Jing Guan clasped his hands in front of his chest, and his old eyes became murky at that moment. "Patron Luchang is absolutely right. Please allow Jing Guan to recount it from the beginning..."</p><p></p><p>In the past, before Jing Guan entered the Buddhist path, he had already met, known, and fallen in love with a woman.</p><p></p><p>On the day of the grand wedding, amidst the joyous laughter in the bridal chamber, just as the two were about to be united, Jing Guan suddenly awakened the Buddha nature of his previous eight lifetimes.</p><p></p><p>Suddenly, in the bridal chamber, the chanting of sutras filled the air, and the Buddha's light shone everywhere.</p><p></p><p>The guests were all startled, and the eyes of the woman under the red veil were dazed.</p><p></p><p>No one knew what had happened.</p><p></p><p>Only Jing Guan knew clearly that he had awakened the memories of his previous eight lifetimes, and that he had to... leave.</p><p></p><p>When the Buddha's light disappeared and the chanting of sutras fell silent, in the festive candlelight, Jing Guan and the woman looked at each other across the red veil.</p><p></p><p>Jing Guan looked at the woman with a complex expression, and his figure in the red robe began to fade.</p><p></p><p>The eyes under the woman's red veil trembled, and she stiffly reached out her hand, trying to grab onto something.</p><p></p><p>"Patron, Jing Guan apologizes to you."</p><p></p><p>After saying the last sentence, Jing Guan completely disappeared.</p><p></p><p>The woman's hand froze in the air, and the eyes under the red veil lost their color.</p><p></p><p>As for the guests present, they were dumbfounded on the spot, but soon they regained their senses and looked at the woman with pity, no one spoke.</p><p></p><p>Witnessing the Buddha's light that had just shone, they dared not comment.</p><p></p><p>...</p><p></p><p>Xiaotong and Tongxin's gazes at Jing Guan were already filled with anger!</p><p></p><p>Well, this bald donkey actually deceived someone's feelings.</p><p></p><p>It's easy to imagine that on the day of the grand wedding, for such a big event to suddenly happen, the damage to that woman would be immense.</p><p></p><p>She might live the rest of her life under the gossip of others.</p><p></p><p>And this bald donkey, he didn't even explain himself, he just abandoned the woman and ran away. This is too cruel, no different from tearing her heart out.</p><p></p><p>Towards the attitudes of Tongxin and Xiaotong, Jing Guan seemed to have not heard them at all. He just kept his hands clasped and looked at Luchang Sheng.</p><p></p><p>Luchang Sheng glanced at him and said indifferently, "Continue."</p><p></p><p>Jing Guan silently nodded, "Afterwards..."</p><p></p><p>Afterwards, Jing Guan entered the Tianyin Monastery to cultivate.</p><p></p><p>But every time Jing Guan faced the Buddha statue, his mind could not help but recall the bits and pieces of the past.</p><p></p><p>Thinking of the past...</p><p></p><p>Here is the full English translation of the Chinese excerpt:</p><p></p><p>Recalling the appearance and voice of the woman.</p><p></p><p>Recalling the woman's sorrowful and desperate gaze of the past, recalling the various events on the day of the wedding.</p><p></p><p>Zhen suddenly realized that he had fallen into the ninth tribulation of his life!</p><p></p><p>In the previous eight lives, with Zhen's Buddha nature, no matter whether it was joy, anger, sorrow, fear, evil desires, or various other desires, he had overcome them one by one.</p><p></p><p>Unexpectedly, in the ninth life, the love of the seven emotions is what made Zhen stop in his tracks, unable to transcend it himself.</p><p></p><p>Zhen knelt in front of the Buddha without success, and the restlessness and longing in his heart accumulated day by day, until he could no longer bear it and returned to the woman's hometown.</p><p></p><p>But he forgot that kneeling before the Buddha is a three-thousand-year ordeal.</p><p></p><p>The hometown had already become a place where things and people were no longer the same.</p><p></p><p>A sense of foreboding arose in Zhen's heart, and he tremblingly took out a delicate incense bag from his bosom and exerted his boundless spiritual power.</p><p></p><p>Finally, he found it, a lonely grave in the wilderness.</p><p></p><p>The grave was cracked, with countless withered vines, and the gravestone was nameless.</p><p></p><p>Zhen stood in front of the grave, holding the incense bag, his expression stunned.</p><p></p><p>His eyes gradually turned bloodshot, and he unleashed his spiritual power throughout his body, then immediately fell to his knees.</p><p></p><p>"You... you should not have become a victim in my tribulation, you... you are a living person..."</p><p></p><p>"I... I'm sorry to you..."</p><p></p><p>He knelt for an unknown length of time.</p><p></p><p>Zhen slowly got up, numb, and began to tidy up the lonely grave.</p><p></p><p>He cleared the withered vines and thorns with his bare hands, unaware that his hands were covered in blood.</p><p></p><p>When Zhen came to the gravestone, when he saw the words carved on it, he paused, then finally burst into tears, weeping uncontrollably.</p><p></p><p>"The pigeon wants to fly, I am reluctant in my heart, but I still pray that it will fly across mountains and rivers."</p><p></p><p>...</p><p></p><p>The medical hall was silent.</p><p></p><p>Only the rhythmic sound of Lu Changsheng's fingertips tapping on the table.</p><p></p><p>Zhen's eyes had merged with his memories, brimming with tears, without him realizing it.</p><p></p><p>Tongxin and Xiaotong felt a little sad, silently glancing at the calm gentleman from the corner of their eyes.</p><p></p><p>"Master Lu, is there a good medicine to cure Zhen's heart illness?"</p><p></p><p>Zhen lowered his head, clasped his hands, and bowed without expression.</p><p></p><p>Lu Changsheng looked at him for a long time and said, "This is your ninth tribulation. Do you want to overcome this tribulation and attain Buddhahood?"</p><p></p><p>Zhen was slightly surprised, but silently acknowledged it with a Buddha's name.</p><p></p><p>"In your opinion, how should you overcome this tribulation?" Lu Changsheng suddenly asked.</p><p></p><p>Zhen hesitated, shaking his head, "Master Lu, Zhen has been deeply trapped in the ninth tribulation for a long time, and I have no other way, so I came to ask you."</p><p></p><p>He had traveled through thousands of mountains and rivers, asked others, and asked himself, but never received an answer.</p><p></p><p>If he could not overcome the ninth tribulation, it would be difficult to attain Buddhahood, and even harder to find his true self.</p><p></p><p>"Aren't you monks supposed to be compassionate?" Lu Changsheng said calmly.</p><p></p><p>Zhen was saddened, knowing the meaning behind Lu Changsheng's words.</p><p></p><p>"Your actions have gone against compassion. How can you then achieve Buddhahood?"</p><p></p><p>Hearing the calm yet pointed question from the young man in green, Zhen was enlightened, but had no words to respond, becoming even more silent.</p><p></p><p>"This lifetime, the more you try to escape the word 'love', the debts of emotion you owe that woman will only bind you tighter."</p><p></p><p>Lu Changsheng's eyes flickered, his voice cold, "You are likely to carry a burden of guilt, haunted by nightmares, until the end of this life."</p><p></p><p>Zhen's throat seemed to be blocked by something, and he looked up at the young man in front of him, his old eyes trembling.</p><p></p><p>He seemed to understand.</p><p></p><p>As a participant in this drama, the path he had walked and the direction he had sought were wrong all along.</p><p></p><p>But this lifetime, how long it has been... when will he be able to repay it all.</p><p></p><p>He knew that he had made a mistake on the day of the wedding, and the three-thousand-year kneeling before the Buddha was an even greater mistake.</p><p></p><p>He missed the best time to repay the debt of emotion.</p><p></p><p>By the time the beauty had passed away, he finally realized.</p><p></p><p>The sentence on the gravestone was the beginning of his fall into tribulation.</p><p></p><p>Looking at the seemingly enlightened Zhen, Lu Changsheng was slightly disappointed and said,</p><p></p><p>"I've said so much, but you still don't understand. You are still struggling with how to repay the debt of emotion, using a mundane person as a sacrifice to cultivate and overcome the tribulation. Such cruelty, then your Buddha..."</p><p></p><p>"Forget about cultivation."</p>

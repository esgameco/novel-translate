        <h1>Chapter 270</h1>
        <div class="content">
            <p>Here is the full English translation of the Chinese excerpt:</p><p></p><p>In the boundless void, ‚ôü‚úé‚ûÖ‚ùæùî∞–ΩùïåÀ£.œÇœåÔº≠üëª‚ô™</p><p></p><p>The stars still twinkled, and in the distant darkness, mysterious starlight flashed across the sky, vanishing in an instant.</p><p></p><p>Lu Changsheng and Li Shuyan were flying slowly through the dazzling void, one in front of the other.</p><p></p><p>"Shuyan, Old Turtle and Tongxin are no longer here, so I'll leave the trivial matters to you from now on. Any problems with that?" Lu Changsheng asked casually, hands behind his back.</p><p></p><p>"No problem!" Li Shuyan replied solemnly, bowing.</p><p></p><p>Wearing a black robe and with his hair grown long, Li Shuyan was more handsome than the average person, but his face was usually rather wooden and his emotions were limited. Only when Lu Changsheng spoke would expressions appear on his face.</p><p></p><p>If he had once been a compassionate Buddhist, he now seemed more like a soulless assassin.</p><p></p><p>"I know why you want to follow me," Lu Changsheng said calmly, his black hair swaying.</p><p></p><p>Li Shuyan was startled, then bowed and said, "Since the ninth calamity..."</p><p></p><p>But before he could finish, Lu Changsheng shook his head. "No, that's only a small part of the reason. The bigger reason was when we were at Mount Milo."</p><p></p><p>Li Shuyan's body trembled, and he said hoarsely, "The master is absolutely right."</p><p></p><p>After a moment of silence, he sighed, "I have cultivated for many years, and under the master's enlightenment, I finally attained a Buddha's body. Yet... I couldn't withstand the master's strike. The master is even able to extinguish the Dao of the Ancestral Celestial Realm. The master's mighty power is something I have never heard of or seen before.</p><p></p><p>From that moment on, I was no longer satisfied with the Ancestral Celestial Realm. I ultimately couldn't escape from desires and greed, so I relinquished my position as a Buddhist master and revered my true heart, hoping the master would take me as a disciple!"</p><p></p><p>Lu Changsheng paused, then turned and looked at him strangely. "By following me, you can certainly become stronger. But if you want to become as strong as me... I'm afraid that's impossible in this lifetime."</p><p></p><p>This was no joke. He possessed the Eternal Physique, which was him, and he was the Eternal Physique. He could race through time against the entire boundless void, and would only grow stronger.</p><p></p><p>To put it bluntly, even if the boundless void were to be extinguished one day, Lu Changsheng might not necessarily die.</p><p></p><p>As for Li Shuyan, even if he reached his limit, and even if he had a lifespan of millions or billions of years, he would still ultimately be unable to escape death.</p><p></p><p>Time is the most merciless, like a blade that cuts down everything.</p><p></p><p>If his obsession became too strong, it was hard to imagine what he might do in his final moments.</p><p></p><p>"The master's words are heavy. Although I am no longer satisfied with the Ancestral Celestial Realm, I also know my own limitations and do not dare to compare myself to the master, who is a divine being," Li Shuyan said with a sigh.</p><p></p><p>"No, human desires are endless. Once you reach a certain level, you will inevitably desire the next level, a bottomless pit that can never be filled," Lu Changsheng said softly, looking at him.</p><p></p><p>"After all, it was I who brought you out of the Ancestral Realm. I'm telling you this not for any other reason, but just hope you won't be overly ambitious or stray too far. In the future, don't lose yourself in your desires."</p><p></p><p>"Otherwise... the first one to kill you will be me."</p><p></p><p>Li Shuyan's mind trembled, and his gaze became resolute as he respectfully said, "I will remember the master's words."</p><p></p><p>Lu Changsheng nodded slightly, then his eyes suddenly flashed as he looked into the distant void, a faint smile appearing on his lips. "Interesting..."</p><p></p><p>Hearing this, Li Shuyan was puzzled. He looked up and followed Lu Changsheng's gaze, but saw nothing.</p><p></p><p>He couldn't help but ask, "Master, what's wrong?"</p><p></p><p>"We've been targeted," Lu Changsheng said calmly.</p><p></p><p>Huh?</p><p></p><p>Li Shuyan was bewildered, but the next sentence made his pupils contract in shock.</p><p></p><p>"Five Boundless Celestial Dao on par with the Ancestral Celestial Realm Dao."</p><p></p><p>Five Boundless Celestial Dao, each at the level of a middle-world Dao!</p><p></p><p>What were Boundless Celestial Dao? They were Dao without their own worlds.</p><p></p><p>These Dao, while slightly weaker than Dao with their own worlds, were by no means weak. They had their own advantages, which was that they could...</p><p></p><p>Here is the full English translation of the Chinese excerpt:</p><p></p><p>Soaring in the void, it is more self-possessed.</p><p></p><p>And the Heavenly Dao that possesses its own world is strong in that it can mobilize the primal forces of that world in battle.</p><p></p><p>But it also has a weakness - without the command from above, they cannot leave their own world.</p><p></p><p>Because if they do, that world will collapse!</p><p></p><p>"Five... five of them!" Li Shuyan's aura suddenly burst forth, as if facing a formidable enemy!</p><p></p><p>Lu Changsheng glanced at him sideways, without a word.</p><p></p><p>Li Shuyan paused, his expression becoming awkward, and he quietly put away his stance.</p><p></p><p>Yes, not to mention five, even one of them would be a complete mismatch for him.</p><p></p><p>At the same time, a vague worry arose in his heart.</p><p></p><p>After all, in the Ancestral Heavenly Realm, the Master had fought one-on-one with that Heavenly Dao, but now it was one against five...</p><p></p><p>With such a situation, the changes and twists and turns would be hard to foresee.</p><p></p><p>"Master, you..." Li Shuyan hesitated, wanting to say, "Master, shall we retreat first? It's better to have the green mountains than to have no firewood to burn."</p><p></p><p>Just then!</p><p></p><p>Li Shuyan's gaze sharpened, as he sensed an indescribable power descending, locking onto them!</p><p></p><p>He was familiar with it - this was the power of the Heavenly Dao!!</p><p></p><p>Lu Changsheng's calm, water-like eyes looked over, and in the void, five towering phantoms came rushing towards them.</p><p></p><p>Though tens of thousands of feet tall, they were dwarfed in the endless void, like specks of dust against the countless stars.</p><p></p><p>"Master, they're here," Li Shuyan said solemnly, turning his head to look at Lu Changsheng's profile, only to be stunned to find no expression on the Master's face.</p><p></p><p>In that moment, his blood was surging with a mix of worry, panic, anticipation, and excitement...</p><p></p><p>To be honest, in the Ancestral Heavenly Realm, there were few who could pose a threat to him, and the environment was relatively peaceful.</p><p></p><p>But after following the Master out of the Ancestral Heavenly Realm, they had encountered five Mid-World level Heavenly Daos in the very beginning!</p><p></p><p>In the Ancestral Heavenly Realm, where could one have seen such a sight?</p><p></p><p>Such a desperate situation was rare to encounter.</p><p></p><p>At the same time, </p><p>not too far from Lu Changsheng and Li Shuyan, a group of young men and women suddenly turned pale.</p><p></p><p>The aura of the Heavenly Dao, and five of them at that! Boundless Heavenly Daos!</p><p></p><p>What is going on? What kind of day is this, that they would encounter Boundless Heavenly Daos?</p><p></p><p>They must flee quickly, for the Boundless Heavenly Daos in the void can be both good and evil, and the ill-tempered ones would simply kill any living being they encounter!</p><p></p><p>"We must leave this void immediately!"</p><p></p><p>But just then, a slow, drawn-out sound of a sword being unsheathed echoed through the void!</p><p></p><p>"Clang~~"</p><p></p><p>This sound of the sword being drawn seemed to have a magical power, freezing the group in place, unable to move.</p><p></p><p>And the Heavenly Dao's words that reached their ears made them shiver:</p><p></p><p>"It is you, who extinguished the Heavenly Dao of that Mid-World."</p><p></p><p>"In this void, aside from the Eight Great Ancient Clans, I never expected there to be someone else daring to clash with us Heavenly Daos."</p><p></p><p>"Today, this living being must die."</p><p></p><p>...</p><p></p><p>Lu Changsheng's blue robe fluttered, his ink-black hair slightly swaying.</p><p></p><p>Holding the sheath with his left hand and the sword in his right, his calm eyes gazed upon the five towering phantoms.</p><p></p><p>The chilling aura from the sword's tip stood in stark contrast to the gentle smile on his lips.</p><p></p><p>Beside him, Li Shuyan stared in awe at this scene, recognizing the ancient sword in the Master's hand!</p><p></p><p>It was the same world-subduing sword that had been suspended in the azure sky above Mount Milo when the Ancestral Heavenly Realm collapsed!</p><p></p><p>"Shuyan."</p><p></p><p>"M-Master."</p><p></p><p>"If I were to strike out with a sword now, what would be the chances of success?"</p><p></p><p>Li Shuyan replied with difficulty, "T-ten, ten..."</p><p></p><p>"No need to hesitate, it is ten out of ten."</p><p></p><p>Lu Changsheng's lips curved up slightly.</p><p></p><p>The next moment, without any flourish, he struck out with his sword!</p><p></p><p>"Whoosh‚Äî"</p><p></p><p>And in the instant the violent sword energy erupted from that void,</p><p></p><p>"Clang!"</p><p></p><p>Lu Changsheng's sword had already returned to its sheath.</p>

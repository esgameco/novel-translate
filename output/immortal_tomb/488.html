        <h1>Chapter 488</h1>
        <div class="content">
            <p>Here is the full English translation of the Chinese excerpt:</p><p></p><p>Swoosh!</p><p></p><p>A figure plummeted from the sky like a meteor, crashing heavily into the center of Eternal Night City!</p><p></p><p>Boom!</p><p></p><p>Under the tremendous impact, Eternal Night City shook.</p><p></p><p>Countless shocked gazes instantly turned towards the source.</p><p></p><p>Huh? Has one of the three major factions already decided the victor so quickly?</p><p></p><p>The members of the three major factions unanimously paused their battles, their eyes fixed intently on that spot, wanting to see who had been defeated...</p><p></p><p>Was it one of the three leaders of the Three Tigers Gang? Or was it the chairman of the Fierce Lion Society, or the patriarch of the Savage Elephant Sect?</p><p></p><p>Soon, as the dust settled, a large crater became increasingly visible to the onlookers.</p><p></p><p>The core disciples of the three factions quickly rushed over, their expressions showing evident anxiety.</p><p></p><p>The group of core disciples took a deep breath and peered into the crater.</p><p></p><p>The moment they saw who it was, the core disciples of the Three Tigers Gang visibly relaxed.</p><p></p><p>However, the expressions of the Fierce Lion Society and Savage Elephant Sect changed, especially the core disciples of the Savage Elephant Sect, who hurriedly descended into the crater, their voices trembling:</p><p></p><p>"Patriarch!"</p><p></p><p>The Patriarch of the Savage Elephant Sect?!</p><p></p><p>Instantly, an uproar swept through the scene!</p><p></p><p>In fact, they had originally guessed that the defeated person would be the second or third leader of the Three Tigers Gang.</p><p></p><p>But to think that the one defeated was the Patriarch of the Savage Elephant Sect, this was completely unexpected!</p><p></p><p>And the Fierce Lion Society and Savage Elephant Sect were on the same side, so does this mean...</p><p></p><p>At the scene, the members of the Fierce Lion Society and Savage Elephant Sect began to pale, their bodies trembling!</p><p></p><p>The defeat of the Savage Elephant Sect Patriarch essentially meant that the Three Tigers Gang had won this confrontation!</p><p></p><p>After all, the remaining Fierce Lion Society chairman had no chance of taking on all three of them alone!</p><p></p><p>Boom!!</p><p></p><p>The next moment, a powerful flash erupted from the sky, followed by a pained scream.</p><p></p><p>Everyone could tell that it was the voice of the Fierce Lion Society chairman.</p><p></p><p>"Chairman?!"</p><p></p><p>The members of the Fierce Lion Society also lost their composure, their expressions utterly grim.</p><p></p><p>The defeat of their peak experts...</p><p></p><p>From now on, the Three Tigers Gang would definitely not spare the members of their two factions!</p><p></p><p>Boom!</p><p></p><p>Suddenly, the Fierce Lion Society chairman also plummeted from the sky, but upon landing, he clutched his chest and forcibly stabilized himself, his condition clearly much better than the Savage Elephant Sect Patriarch.</p><p></p><p>"Chairman!"</p><p></p><p>The core disciples and members of the Fierce Lion Society quickly crowded around him, their faces filled with concern.</p><p></p><p>The Fierce Lion Society chairman waved his hand, but then coughed up a mouthful of fresh blood, his entire being extremely weak.</p><p></p><p>Two core disciples hurriedly supported him on either side!</p><p></p><p>"Haha haha haha, the Fierce Lion Society and Savage Elephant Sect are nothing but weaklings!!"</p><p></p><p>A reckless laughter echoed through the crowd, and soon the three leaders of the Three Tigers Gang materialized.</p><p></p><p>Although the three gang leaders were disheveled, with messy hair and slightly unstable breathing, they were in far better shape than the Fierce Lion Society chairman.</p><p></p><p>"Ooh~~~"</p><p></p><p>The members of the Three Tigers Gang immediately erupted in cheers.</p><p></p><p>In stark contrast to the gloomy and dejected expressions of the Fierce Lion Society and Savage Elephant Sect.</p><p></p><p>"The victor has been decided, no need for further words!!"</p><p></p><p>The Fierce Lion Society chairman panted: "You Three Tigers Gang have won, and from this day on, we of the Fierce Lion Society and Savage Elephant Sect will leave Eternal Night Island!"</p><p></p><p>"Leave Eternal Night Island? Don't even dream of it! You from the Fierce Lion Society and Savage Elephant Sect, not a single one of you will be allowed to leave!!"</p><p></p><p>The three gang leaders immediately said in a ruthless tone.</p><p></p><p>Let them leave? That was impossible!</p><p></p><p>Those who can be killed must be killed!</p><p>Eliminate any future threats!</p><p></p><p>Hearing this, a chill ran through the crowd!</p><p></p><p>The members of the two factions gradually felt a sense of despair...and madness!</p><p></p><p>Since they won't let us leave, then we'll fight to the death!</p><p>Since we're going to die anyway, we might as well take a layer of skin off the Three Tigers Gang!</p><p></p><p>"We are willing to leave and guarantee that we will never set foot here again, why do you... still insist on being so merciless!"</p><p></p><p>The Fierce Lion Society chairman panted, unwilling to accept this.</p><p></p><p>The ship captain watching this scene felt a sense of unease.</p><p></p><p>To be honest, even if the Three Tigers Gang had ambitions, if it weren't for the death of a core disciple giving them a reason and excuse to act, today's events would have been delayed for quite some time.</p><p></p><p>It was their shipping guild that had indirectly harmed these two major factions, after all.</p><p></p><p>"Hehe, actually, this gang leader would have been willing to let you go, if only it weren't for the need to avenge the deaths of Big Bear and hundreds of my brothers..."</p><p></p><p>Here is the full English translation of the Chinese excerpt:</p><p></p><p>"If you let them leave Yeyezhou Island alive, I'm afraid Big Bear and the others won't rest in peace even in death!" </p><p></p><p>The Third Faction Leader sneered coldly.</p><p></p><p>Hearing this, the Fierce Lion Leader couldn't hold back anymore and let out a low roar:</p><p></p><p>"I'm telling you again, the Three Tiger Faction Elders were not killed by us, not at all!!"</p><p></p><p>"If you want to fight, then fight. Don't come up with these disgusting excuses, put away that nauseating expression of yours!"</p><p></p><p>The Third Faction Leader's eyes turned cold as he tilted his head and said, "Big Brother, let's just take care of these people directly. The Beastly Elephant Faction Master is severely injured and unconscious, and the Fierce Lion Leader has also lost his fighting power. The rest are just a bunch of nobodies."</p><p></p><p>The Grand Faction Leader pursed his lips and slowly spoke, "Then... kill them!"</p><p></p><p>As the words fell, the three Faction Leaders' auras of laws and principles gradually emerged, exuding a terrifying killing intent!</p><p></p><p>They were about to personally step in and annihilate these people!</p><p></p><p>Seeing this, the Fierce Lion Leader and the others naturally had no intention of passively waiting for their deaths. They let out a low roar:</p><p></p><p>"Fierce Lion Faction, Beastly Elephant Faction, listen up! The Three Tiger Faction won't let us go, let's fight to the end with them!"</p><p></p><p>The Third Faction Leader sneered, "A bunch of nobodies!"</p><p></p><p>However, just as the two sides were about to engage in the final battle, a young man in a green robe, respectfully following an old, stooped man, walked into the scene.</p><p></p><p>This caused the previously scorching atmosphere to suddenly freeze.</p><p></p><p>Countless gazes of doubt and surprise fell upon the young man in green.</p><p></p><p>Who was this person, and how could he be so oblivious, standing out at a time like this, not afraid of angering the Three Tiger Faction?</p><p></p><p>"Master?!"</p><p></p><p>The captain, Chen Pang, Xiao Chai, and other passengers on the Sea Transport No. 3 had a subtle change in their expressions.</p><p></p><p>Others might not know, but they were acutely aware of how terrifying this person was.</p><p></p><p>He was an Arcane Master, one of the few in the Three Thousand Realms, a man at the top of the food chain!</p><p></p><p>"Hmm?"</p><p></p><p>At this moment, the entire scene fell silent, everyone looking puzzled at Lu Changsheng.</p><p></p><p>Whether it was the three Faction Leaders of the Three Tiger Faction or the Fierce Lion Leader, their gazes were slightly bewildered.</p><p></p><p>Lu Changsheng walked slowly in front of the three Faction Leaders of the Three Tiger Faction, swept a glance at the three of them, and said with a faint smile:</p><p></p><p>"Do me a favor and stop fighting."</p><p></p><p>Huh?</p><p></p><p>Except for the pale-faced captain and the others, everyone in the scene looked at each other in bewilderment, and their faces quickly flushed red as they wanted to roar.</p><p></p><p>The Third Faction Leader twitched the corner of his mouth, exchanged a strange look with the Grand Faction Leader and the Second Faction Leader, then tilted his head, put his hand on his ear, and pretended to listen:</p><p></p><p>"You, you just said what? The Faction Leader didn't hear it clearly."</p><p></p><p>The old turtle behind Lu Changsheng looked at the Third Faction Leader with pity, silently evaluating him as someone courting death.</p><p></p><p>Lu Changsheng smiled again, "Do me a favor and stop fighting."</p><p></p><p>In fact, that meal wasn't a big deal. Lu Changsheng's real purpose in appearing was to lend a hand to the Fierce Lion Faction and the Beastly Elephant Faction.</p><p></p><p>After all, Big Bear was the one he had killed, and these two factions had been affected to some extent.</p><p></p><p>Lu Changsheng didn't want to mess with the Three Tiger Faction, as long as they were willing to back down.</p><p></p><p>"Oh~ Do you a favor, huh? What are you exactly!" </p><p></p><p>The Third Faction Leader first sneered in a yin-yang tone, then suddenly slapped towards Lu Changsheng!!!</p><p></p><p>But the next moment, the Third Faction Leader's expression changed drastically!!!</p><p></p><p>The entire scene also fell into silence at this moment, everyone watching the scene in the center with shock.</p><p></p><p>Lu Changsheng raised his hand, lightly pinching the Third Faction Leader's palm with his middle and index fingers, and the Third Faction Leader's palm could not advance an inch, as if it had been bitten by a terrifying steel claw!!</p><p></p><p>Lu Changsheng's smile faded, and suddenly he twisted it!!</p><p></p><p>Accompanied by the Third Faction Leader's agonizing scream, his entire arm was twisted off!!</p><p></p><p>The Third Faction Leader's eyes were filled with terror as he retreated while clutching his shoulder!!</p><p></p><p>The atmosphere in the area was instantly frozen!</p><p></p><p>Lu Changsheng casually threw the Third Faction Leader's arm to the ground, patted his hands, and his tone became less amiable:</p><p></p><p>"Since you're unwilling to do me a favor, let me put it another way. How should I deal with you for disturbing my meal?"</p>

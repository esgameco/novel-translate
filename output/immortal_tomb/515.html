        <h1>Chapter 515</h1>
        <div class="content">
            <p>Here is the full English translation of the Chinese excerpt:</p><p></p><p>In the scene, the man in blue robes wielded a sword, calmly facing countless demons.</p><p></p><p>Seeing this, the onlookers' hearts suddenly raced, thinking, "Could this blue-robed man be our Dao Master?"</p><p></p><p>Those who had seen Lu Changsheng but had not yet perished, such as Lei Yu, Lei Ting, Chu Lingian, Jian Wuhui, and many others, were all plunged into profound shock, their minds in a daze!</p><p></p><p>Dao Master!! </p><p></p><p>It's actually the Dao Master!</p><p></p><p>Recalling the past, they had once sat and drank with the Dao Master, even... everything seemed so unreal, so dreamlike.</p><p></p><p>But soon, they became deeply worried - there was no room for them to think of anything else at the moment!</p><p></p><p>They were worried about Lu Changsheng. Although Lu Changsheng had never been defeated in their eyes, the enemy he now faced was clearly different!</p><p></p><p>Yet they could do nothing to help, only watching with a heavy heart and a deep sense of powerlessness.</p><p></p><p>...</p><p></p><p>In the Carefree Sect.</p><p></p><p>Everyone's bodies trembled, their eyes bloodshot, not out of excitement, but out of emotion, self-blame, and boundless worry.</p><p></p><p>The Sect Master... was actually the Dao Master.</p><p></p><p>No wonder the Sect Master had never been defeated, no matter how powerful the enemy was, he would always be stronger.</p><p></p><p>No wonder the Sect Master was so carefree and unrestrained - it was because he was truly like that.</p><p></p><p>No wonder they had been left here for so long - it was not that the Sect Master had forgotten them, but that he was protecting them.</p><p></p><p>"We... are really just a burden, useless!" </p><p></p><p>Peng Fang clenched his fists tightly, the veins bulging, and roared with reddened eyes.</p><p></p><p>All the elders and disciples remained silent, their hearts heavy with powerlessness, only gazing at the blue-robed man in the scene with pained eyes.</p><p></p><p>Tong Xin's eyes were red-rimmed, his heart trembling, "Master, please don't let anything happen to you."</p><p></p><p>...</p><p></p><p>At the Eighth Creation Pillar.</p><p></p><p>The countless Devouring Void Sacred Demons sneered at the blue-robed man before them, looking at him as if he were a mere plaything.</p><p></p><p>Each member of the Devouring Void Sacred Demon Clan was fierce and powerful in battle!</p><p></p><p>This time, the Eight Sacred Demon Gods, the hundreds of Sacred Demon Emperors, and the thousands of Sacred Demon Lords had all gathered. How could this man be defeated?</p><p></p><p>Even if he was the Dao Master, so what?</p><p></p><p>"Haha, the Dao Master of the Boundless Void? Daring to come alone, how brave!" </p><p></p><p>Seviel unfurled his seven pairs of great wings, mocking the blue-robed man.</p><p></p><p>The other seven Sacred Demon Gods also looked at the blue-robed man with amusement, while harboring intense killing intent!</p><p></p><p>No matter what, this man was truly obstructing them!</p><p></p><p>Returning between the Creation Pillars would waste too much time!</p><p></p><p>They only wanted to quickly absorb all the energy from the Creation Pillars and leave this place!</p><p></p><p>Lu Changsheng's expression remained calm as he silently sent Old Turtle and the others out from the Great Dao Demon-Subduing Tower.</p><p></p><p>"Master!"</p><p>"Dao Master!"</p><p></p><p>As soon as Old Turtle and Hunhun came out, they saw the countless Devouring Void Sacred Demons and their pupils immediately shrank, stunned - so many?!</p><p></p><p>Lu Changsheng said indifferently, "I originally planned to defeat them one by one, but the situation has changed. When the time comes, don't stray too far from me, or I may not be able to take care of you."</p><p></p><p>Originally, he had planned to leave Old Turtle and the others in the Great Dao Demon-Subduing Tower, but he needed to use the tower.</p><p></p><p>"Yes!"</p><p></p><p>Old Turtle and Hunhun nodded solemnly in response.</p><p></p><p>As for Reincarnation Magic Child, his eyes were bloodthirsty - so many Devouring Void Sacred Demons, he was so excited, the blood of hatred surging wildly!</p><p></p><p>He knew that the Sacred Demon Lords and Sacred Demon Emperors among them were extremely powerful, but if he could kill even one, it would be worth it, and if he could kill two, it would be a huge gain!</p><p></p><p>As for the countless Sacred Demon soldiers, he didn't even consider them a threat at all!</p><p></p><p>"Xiao Tong, you are the weakest, you don't need to do anything, just stand behind me."</p><p></p><p>Lu Changsheng tightened his grip on the long sword, speaking indifferently.</p><p></p><p>"Yes." He Xitong responded respectfully, her gaze bitterly resigned. She knew that her Eternal Calamity Body might be useful to the Master, but the feeling of being so powerless was very unpleasant.</p><p></p><p>Old Turtle and Hunhun stood in a line beside Lu Changsheng, their gazes gradually turning fierce!</p><p></p><p>The eight Sacred Demon Gods paused, then looked at each other and burst into laughter!</p><p></p><p>"Hahaha hahaha hahaha!!"</p><p></p><p>Suddenly, Seviel roared, "Kill!!"</p><p></p><p>In the next moment, countless Devouring Void Sacred Demons charged forward like a great tide.</p><p></p><p>Here is the full English translation of the Chinese excerpt:</p><p></p><p>The sea-like energy surged towards Luchang Sheng and the others!!</p><p></p><p>Sai Wei'er and the other Saint Demon Gods merely looked on coldly.</p><p></p><p>Of course, they would not make the first move, as the opponent was the Dao Venerable of the Endless Void, so they should probe first before acting!</p><p></p><p>Old Turtle and Hunhui's gazes suddenly became grave!</p><p></p><p>However, although the numbers were numerous, the Saint Demon Emperors and the eight Saint Demon Gods had not yet made a move!</p><p></p><p>"Hunhui, let's kill!" Old Turtle's body suddenly emitted a dark green glow, and three supreme Dao principles erupted with great force!</p><p></p><p>Hunhui looked at Old Turtle's state and the three terrifying Dao principles with a shocked expression, and then nodded heavily, "Mm!"</p><p></p><p>Hunhui knew that since the Saint Demon Emperors and Saint Demon Gods had not moved, the Dao Venerable would naturally not move either.</p><p></p><p>This round would be their clash with the Devouring Void Saint Demon Emperors and below!</p><p></p><p>Hunhui's eyes narrowed, turning into black mist and emerging, and when he manifested, he had already formed a hand seal, roaring loudly:</p><p></p><p>"All beings in the world, hear the command of this Emperor's soul! Soul Summoning Technique!!!"</p><p></p><p>...</p><p></p><p>In the scene, after Hunhui used his technique, countless vortices emitting black mist appeared out of thin air!</p><p></p><p>As countless eerie howls and chilling laughter rang out, countless soul bodies of various forms surged out from the black vortices like a flood!</p><p></p><p>Their numbers increased madly, obscuring the sky, as if given enough time, they could even outnumber the Devouring Void Saint Demons!</p><p></p><p>The onlookers looked at the robust middle-aged man in black robes with fiery red long hair, their eyes filled with shock and hope!</p><p></p><p>Who is this person... so powerful!</p><p></p><p>He can summon so many soul beings!</p><p></p><p>Indeed, those who can be taken by the Dao Venerable to fight the Devouring Void Saint Demons must be extraordinary figures!</p><p></p><p>At the same time, the Qimei Wangliang transformed, their bodies becoming immensely huge, seemingly tens of thousands of feet tall. Their masks fell off, revealing fierce faces with fangs, wielding soul-shrouded soul chains, bone hammers burning with white flames, and ice jade gleaming shields, like the Underworld Kings, utterly awe-inspiring!</p><p></p><p>Seeing this, the Reincarnation Demon Child also did not want to fall behind, taking a deep breath and opening its seemingly all-consuming abyss-like mouth, letting out devouring roars!</p><p></p><p>This scene gave the onlookers a huge boost of confidence!</p><p></p><p>They all look so powerful!</p><p></p><p>"Kill!" </p><p></p><p>Old Turtle's shout rang out.</p><p></p><p>Hunhui gestured, commanding all the soul beings to attack the Devouring Void Saint Demons!!</p><p></p><p>Roar!!!</p><p></p><p>At the same time, the Qimei Wangliang also moved their heavy steps, swinging their weapons and charging forward!</p><p></p><p>The Reincarnation Demon Child's abyss-like mouth suddenly erupted with suction power, causing the surrounding space to tremble slightly.</p><p></p><p>The momentum was earth-shaking, as if the barriers in the sky were faintly vibrating!!</p><p></p><p>But the Devouring Void Saint Demon army facing this did not show the slightest fear, instead letting out mocking cold laughter and charging forward to meet them head-on!!</p><p></p><p>The cataclysmic battle was about to begin!</p><p></p><p>In the back, Luchang Sheng did not even glance at Old Turtle and the others, only locking his gaze calmly on the hundreds of Saint Demon Emperors and eight Saint Demon Gods across.</p><p></p><p>As long as these core Devouring Void Saint Demons showed any signs of movement, he would act!!</p><p></p><p>At the same time, Sai Wei'er and the other Demons looked slightly surprised at Hunhui and the others, but then also shifted their gaze through the countless soldiers to stare at Luchang Sheng, with a mocking expression.</p><p></p><p>Instantly, Luchang Sheng's calm gaze and the gazes of the many core Devouring Void Saint Demons clashed, creating sparks of lightning in the air!!</p><p></p><p>"Rumble!!"</p><p></p><p>The lightning sparks created by this gaze clash instantly annihilated quite a few of the Devouring Void Saint Demons and soul beings!!</p><p></p><p>At the same time, Old Turtle charged up with overwhelming killing intent, rapidly changing hand seals between his hands, and the three supreme Dao principles suddenly activated, instantly unfolding in the space!!</p><p></p><p>"Spatial Dao Technique - Ten Directions Folding!"</p><p>"Yin-Yang Dao Technique - Yin Killing Hundred-Fold Amplification!"</p><p>"Destruction Dao Technique - Divine Consciousness Collapse Technique!!"</p><p>...</p><p></p><p>PS: I'll be back to two updates per day in a couple of days.

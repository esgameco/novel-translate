        <h1>Chapter 496</h1>
        <div class="content">
            <p>Here is the full English translation of the excerpt from the Chinese novel:</p><p></p><p>"Master, who is this Chu You?" </p><p></p><p>The old turtle hesitated and asked in the mist above the Sea of Laws.</p><p></p><p>In fact, the old turtle had been itching to ask this question ever since they reached the snow-capped peak on the Ascending Heaven Island.</p><p></p><p>At the time, the old turtle had already gathered some understanding from the conversation between Luchang Sheng and the elder of the Chu Clan.</p><p></p><p>The main thing the old turtle was puzzled about was how this Chu You of the Chu Clan had managed to provoke Luchang Sheng.</p><p></p><p>He must have a really big guts, the old turtle thought admiringly!</p><p></p><p>Luchang Sheng glanced at the old turtle and said indifferently, "Oh, I forgot that I had knocked you unconscious back then."</p><p></p><p>The old turtle chuckled awkwardly.</p><p></p><p>Luchang Sheng said softly, "Xing Tian asked me to go rescue Xiao Tong, and this Chu You is the culprit who wanted to refine Xiao Tong's eternal tribulation body. He even wanted to kill me, hehe."</p><p></p><p>The old turtle was first startled, then reacted and asked puzzledly, "Master, since this happened in the Void Ancient Realm, why didn't you kill him at the time?"</p><p></p><p>"That was just a divine clone of Chu You," Luchang Sheng shrugged casually and continued, "But if I really wanted to kill him back then, that divine clone would have been enough."</p><p></p><p>"After searching his soul, I learned about the Three Thousand Realms. That's why I had the idea to come here, so I just let him live a little longer, no big deal."</p><p></p><p>The old turtle nodded, indicating that he understood. But the old turtle was full of admiration for this Chu You, thinking he was really courting death.</p><p></p><p>The old turtle knew, the Chu Clan was doomed.</p><p></p><p>Ah, the Chu Clan producing such a character as Chu You was really the worst possible luck.</p><p></p><p>Luchang Sheng suddenly asked, "Old Turtle, do you know how vast the Endless Void is?"</p><p></p><p>Although the old turtle didn't know why Luchang Sheng suddenly asked this, he immediately said, "The Endless Void, named as endless, I guess it must be infinitely large, without any boundaries!"</p><p></p><p>Luchang Sheng nodded slightly, "Existing in this infinitely large void, any person, any race, any world, all of them are as tiny as dust, or even less than dust. What are your thoughts on this?"</p><p></p><p>Hearing this, the old turtle fell silent, his mind in a daze, and a vague sense of suffocation arose.</p><p></p><p>The old turtle had thought about this before, but he was carefree by nature and had never felt much about it. As long as he was alive, it didn't matter how vast the Endless Void was, it was infinite anyway, beyond human control and comprehension, so why bother thinking about it?</p><p></p><p>But now, the old turtle felt inexplicably flustered.</p><p></p><p>Because these words came suddenly from Luchang Sheng, without any warning.</p><p></p><p>Based on his understanding of the master's character all this time, Luchang Sheng would not be so bored as to discuss the vastness of the Endless Void and the insignificance of all things with him.</p><p></p><p>After all, the master was even more carefree than the old turtle.</p><p></p><p>"Master, why are you suddenly talking about this...?"</p><p></p><p>The old turtle finally couldn't help but turn his head and ask with doubt.</p><p></p><p>Luchang Sheng did not answer, but continued to ask, "Do you also know when and how the Endless Void originated, and how long it has existed until now?"</p><p></p><p>The old turtle shook his head repeatedly, his eyes completely bewildered.</p><p></p><p>"If I tell you now that one day in the future, the Endless Void will collapse, would you believe me?"</p><p></p><p>Luchang Sheng then asked calmly.</p><p></p><p>The old turtle trembled, and after a long while, he said with difficulty, "If anyone else said this, the old turtle would not believe it. But coming from you, Master... I believe it!"</p><p></p><p>How come it feels like the master has become a bit strange ever since leaving the Ascending Heaven Island?</p><p></p><p>There's something off, but he can't quite put his finger on it.</p><p></p><p>"Do you know what 'Venerable' means?"</p><p></p><p>Luchang Sheng asked.</p><p></p><p>The old turtle perked up, so the master is finally talking about this! </p><p></p><p>Could it be that the master's strange behavior today is related to this 'Venerable'?</p><p></p><p>"The... Venerable of the Heavenly Dao?" The old turtle asked hesitantly, based on his past experiences.</p><p></p><p>Luchang Sheng shook his head.</p><p></p><p>Here is the full English translation of the Chinese excerpt:</p><p></p><p>As his gaze looked down upon the surging waves of the Sea of Laws, he said, "The Venerable of the Great Dao."</p><p></p><p>The Venerable of the Great Dao?</p><p></p><p>The old turtle's eyes were dazed and bewildered.</p><p></p><p>Lu Changsheng seemed not to have noticed the old turtle's expression and continued, "For all of you, the boundless void may seem endless, but I know the boundless void is not endless, and I also know where the end of the boundless void is."</p><p></p><p>As these words fell, the old turtle's spirit was violently shaken, and his whole body trembled!</p><p></p><p>He finally understood that the master sitting on his back was what kind of extraordinary figure!</p><p></p><p>Next, Lu Changsheng's gaze became hazy, as if talking to himself:</p><p></p><p>"I was born along with the boundless void, and up to now, I have existed for more than 990 million void years."</p><p></p><p>"I am immortal, eternal, but the boundless void has encountered a problem."</p><p></p><p>At this moment, the old turtle was completely confused, not knowing where he was, and unconsciously asked, "Master, what is a void year?"</p><p></p><p>"A void year is probably about 100 billion years for all beings," sighed Lu Changsheng.</p><p></p><p>The old turtle was frightened and suddenly shook, losing control of his body and falling towards the Sea of Laws!</p><p></p><p>Lu Changsheng waved his sleeve and stabilized the old turtle, "How useless."</p><p></p><p>The old turtle did not hear it, as he had fallen into great fear! His whole body trembled incessantly!</p><p></p><p>Lu Changsheng frowned slightly, and with a flick of his finger, the old turtle soon regained consciousness.</p><p></p><p>The old turtle remained silent, his expression even worse than crying.</p><p></p><p>"M-m-m-master, does this little turtle still have the qualifications to be your mount?" the old turtle trembled as he spoke.</p><p></p><p>"Calm down," Lu Changsheng said indifferently, and continued, "Now I know what I need to do. I descended to the mortal world with a fragment of my true self, with the original intention of finding a way to cure the boundless void."</p><p></p><p>"However, during the descent, I was interfered with by the rays of the eight creation pillars supporting the boundless void, causing my cultivation to plummet and my memory to be lost."</p><p></p><p>"But I have to thank you, for if it weren't for your words of 'Venerable Dao' stimulating me, I might not have recovered my memory until the boundless void had already collapsed."</p><p></p><p>The old turtle remained silent, his heart filled with fear and trepidation.</p><p></p><p>"The Great Dao Demon Suppressing Tower was also originally mine, and the Reincarnation Demon Child was also something I casually suppressed there. I left in a hurry because the rays of the creation pillars had already made it difficult for me to control myself, and it was from that point on that my cultivation plummeted to less than one-millionth of its former self, and my memory was lost."</p><p></p><p>Lu Changsheng sighed.</p><p></p><p>His body of eternal life had become stronger and stronger with the passage of time, that was true.</p><p></p><p>But his body of eternal life, after 990 million void years, had actually become too familiar!</p><p></p><p>"M-master, what is the method to cure the boundless void..." the old turtle asked tremblingly, now extremely humble and lacking in self-confidence.</p><p></p><p>Lu Changsheng's gaze sharpened, "The boundless void is theoretically immortal like me, but because the boundless void relies on the eight creation pillars for support, and those eight creation pillars are located at the edges of the boundless void, after so many years, the 'worms' from outside the boundless void have crawled all over the creation pillars, gnawing at them nonstop, causing the current situation."</p><p></p><p>"As long as all the 'worms' on the creation pillars are destroyed, and the edges are completely isolated!"</p><p></p><p>"The boundless void is like my own brother, and I want to save it, and only I can save it."</p><p></p><p>The old turtle opened his mouth, not knowing what to say, and could only silently think to himself, "Incredible."</p>

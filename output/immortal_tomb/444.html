        <h1>Chapter 444</h1>
        <div class="content">
            <p>Here is the full English translation of the Chinese excerpt:</p><p></p><p>Facing the thousand-tentacle demoness, not only were they not afraid, but they even dared to smile?</p><p></p><p>Zhao Kun and Zhao Gao were momentarily stunned, quickly focusing their attention in that direction, and sure enough, they saw the relaxed smile on the corner of the mouth of the Taoist priest in the imperial carriage.</p><p></p><p>The other old man in the imperial carriage didn't seem afraid either, but he did look rather solemn.</p><p></p><p>As for the middle-aged man, his expression was pale, showing that he was just as fearful as the others.</p><p></p><p>"He's actually able to smile? Is he ignorant or fearless?" Zhao Gao couldn't help but comment.</p><p></p><p>"After the casualties in the early years, the Hollow Ancient Realm has long had an unwritten rule that one must not make a commotion when crossing the heavenly abyss, so these three Taoist priests are likely not from our Hollow Ancient Realm, otherwise they wouldn't have made such a disturbance when crossing the heavenly abyss," Zhao Kun quickly analyzed.</p><p></p><p>"Uncle, but the Taoist priest in blue robes doesn't seem afraid. Could it be that he has some secret life-saving technique?" Zhao Gao asked curiously.</p><p></p><p>Zhao Kun narrowed his eyes as he looked at the Taoist priest in the distance, his voice suddenly becoming more solemn:</p><p></p><p>"His calm demeanor can only have two possibilities - either he's a fool, truly foolish, or... he's not afraid of the thousand-tentacle demoness... Which do you think is more likely?"</p><p></p><p>Zhao Gao's pupils shrank, of course the latter possibility was more likely!</p><p></p><p>Anyone with eyes could see that among the three, the Taoist priest in blue robes was the leader, and there was no way he could be a fool.</p><p></p><p>Whew, thinking about it, it's a bit terrifying. Not afraid of the thousand-tentacle demoness, what kind of strength would that require?</p><p></p><p>Zhao Yuan seemed to guess what Zhao Gao was thinking, and said, "It's not necessarily that. Perhaps this person has other means as well. How often do we see experts at the Spiritual Void Realm?"</p><p></p><p>"Yuaner is right. Even if, hypothetically, that Taoist priest is at the Spiritual Void Realm, we would have been discovered by him long ago. But so far, he hasn't even spared us a glance, which means he probably hasn't noticed us," Zhao Kun said decisively.</p><p></p><p>"Alright, enough of that. Uncle, sister, let's retreat first. It's not safe to stay here," Zhao Gao said urgently.</p><p></p><p>Just as the three were about to flee this place of danger, their peripheral vision was shocked to see the old man on the imperial carriage suddenly rush towards the thousand-tentacle demoness!</p><p></p><p>What's going on? These people didn't want to escape, and now they're actually unsheathing their swords?</p><p></p><p>...</p><p></p><p>Old Turtle clenched his fists tightly, his entire body enveloped in a green glow like a turtle shell.</p><p></p><p>Old Turtle actually wanted to face the thousand-tentacle demoness head-on with the hardness of his turtle shell!</p><p></p><p>"Hahaha~"</p><p></p><p>The thousand-tentacle demoness, far from being afraid, let out an excited and chilling laugh, and her countless tentacles suddenly lunged towards Old Turtle!</p><p></p><p>"My lord, will Elder Turtle be alright?" Ye Xun was drenched in cold sweat, anxiously watching the scene unfolding before him.</p><p></p><p>It's no wonder Ye Xun was worried, as in Ye Xun's perception, the thousand-tentacle demoness was incredibly powerful, her aura even more terrifying than Old Turtle's.</p><p></p><p>"Probably not." Luchang Sheng smiled.</p><p></p><p>Huh? Elder Turtle won't make it?</p><p></p><p>Seeing Luchang Sheng's confident expression, Ye Xun was momentarily panicked.</p><p></p><p>Luchang Sheng looked straight ahead and said:</p><p></p><p>"Why are you panicking? Even if Old Turtle can't handle it, don't I still have myself?"</p><p></p><p>"Yes, yes, yes!" Hearing Luchang Sheng say this, Ye Xun's heart immediately calmed down.</p><p></p><p>Although Ye Xun had known the blue-robed gentleman for a while, the gentleman had never truly shown his full strength. But all the signs indicated the gentleman's power, and Ye Xun believed that with the blue-robed gentleman's help, even if they couldn't defeat the terrifying monster, they would at least be able to escape.</p><p></p><p>Just then, Old Turtle and the thousand-tentacle demoness finally clashed!</p><p></p><p>The green glow around Old Turtle kept dodging back and forth...</p><p></p><p>Here is the full English translation of the Chinese excerpt:</p><p></p><p>The old turtle maneuvered flexibly through the dense mass of tentacles.</p><p></p><p>Everyone could see that the old turtle's target was very clear - it was the head of the Thousand Tentacle Demoness!</p><p></p><p>"Sss, this old man is no ordinary person, his cultivation is far stronger than even me, possibly in the late Divine Realm, no, he might even be at the peak of the Divine Realm!!" </p><p></p><p>Hiding in the shadows, Zhao Kun's pupils trembled as he said in great shock.</p><p></p><p>What? Peak of the Divine Realm?!</p><p></p><p>Zhao Gao and Zhao Yuan's bodies shook, looking at that green glow in disbelief.</p><p></p><p>Peak of the Divine Realm? Who is this old man?</p><p></p><p>To have reached such a realm, he must not be an unknown figure!</p><p></p><p>"You little demon, how dare you act arrogantly in front of your Grandpa Turtle! I'll make you die!!"</p><p></p><p>Just then, the old turtle had already approached the Thousand Tentacle Demoness' head, suddenly letting out a startling roar, his aura more powerful than ever before!</p><p></p><p>Boom!</p><p></p><p>The green glow erupted violently on the Thousand Tentacle Demoness' face, covering the sky.</p><p></p><p>This aura made the hidden Zhao Kun trio feel their hearts shudder in fear. Could this old man really defeat the Void Realm Thousand Tentacle Demoness at a higher level?</p><p></p><p>If he could do it, his name would surely shake the ancient Void Realm!</p><p></p><p>Boom!!</p><p></p><p>In just a moment, the Thousand Tentacle Demoness let out a chilling scream, and when everyone looked, they were shocked to see its face completely destroyed, covered in fresh blood.</p><p></p><p>Ye Xun's eyes were filled with both shock and joy. The Azure Robe Senior had just said that Elder Turtle couldn't do it, but the current situation clearly showed that Elder Turtle was gaining the upper hand.</p><p></p><p>Lu Changsheng stood there without a word.</p><p></p><p>The old turtle's strength was indeed on par with this demonic creature, but this was the demonic creature's home ground, and it had not yet unleashed any of its techniques. Plus, the old turtle was more focused on defense, with relatively simple attack methods, so it was unrealistic for the old turtle to defeat the demonic creature.</p><p></p><p>Although Lu Changsheng hadn't interfered with the old turtle's recent performance, he had been watching it all along. Today, he would let this demonic creature teach the old turtle a lesson about his own abilities.</p><p></p><p>"Divine... Divine Void... we were wrong, that old man is actually at the Divine Void Realm, just like our Zhao Clan's ancestor!"</p><p></p><p>In the shadows, Zhao Kun's face turned pale as he said in awe, looking reverently at the old turtle who was battling the Thousand Tentacle Demoness.</p><p></p><p>"What? A Divine Void Realm expert?" </p><p></p><p>Zhao Gao and Zhao Yuan snapped out of their daze, then bitterly smiled. Of course, if that old man wasn't at the Divine Void Realm, how could he possibly injure the Thousand Tentacle Demoness.</p><p></p><p>At the same time, the old turtle, who was engaged in a fierce battle with the Thousand Tentacle Demoness, was growing more and more discouraged.</p><p></p><p>Although the demonic creature could not break through his defenses, he dismally discovered that he could not deal with this creature in the short term either!</p><p></p><p>Even the demonic creature, despite its injuries, seemed to have an increasingly fierce fighting spirit. What was he to do?</p><p></p><p>The master had ordered him to deal with this demonic creature, but how could he report back now?</p><p></p><p>He had thought that with his improved cultivation, he could be carefree for a while, but he didn't expect the enemy to become stronger and stronger as well.</p><p></p><p>Thinking of this, the old turtle glanced at Lu Changsheng's expression while evading the tentacles, only to see the smile at the corner of Lu Changsheng's mouth had disappeared.</p><p></p><p>The old turtle's heart immediately tightened!</p><p></p><p>At this moment, the old turtle heard Lu Changsheng faintly say, "Hurry up and finish the battle, don't dawdle."</p><p></p><p>Hearing this, the old turtle's face paled, knowing that the master must have the intention to punish him.</p><p></p><p>Otherwise, how could the master not have noticed his predicament?</p><p></p><p>While evading, the old turtle carefully replied, "Master, the old turtle cannot accomplish it in the short term..."</p><p></p><p>Lu Changsheng's gaze became slightly cold, his tone indifferent: "The Immortal Turtle, unable to handle a mere demonic creature, what a disgraceful thing."</p>

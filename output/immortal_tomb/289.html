        <h1>Chapter 289</h1>
        <div class="content">
            <p>Here is the full English translation of the Chinese excerpt:</p><p></p><p>"Damn it! That bitch of the Blood Moon actually embarrassed our young master in front of so many people!"</p><p></p><p>In the Miu clan within the Ancient Desolate Royal City, Miu Lun suddenly slammed his fist on the table, his face dark and gloomy. ‚ú©üéÄùü®ùü´ùìàùíΩùìäùìç.ùí∏‚ù§ùìÇüéÄ‚ú©</p><p></p><p>These days, there were many people in the city who made a joke out of this incident, which made Miu Lun angrier and angrier!</p><p></p><p>"Young master, please calm down!" </p><p></p><p>The subordinates hurriedly knelt down, terrified.</p><p></p><p>"What should we do with that woman?" Miu Lun asked with a ruthless gaze.</p><p></p><p>The subordinates trembled, their lips quivering.</p><p></p><p>They really wanted to say, "Young master, the Blood Immortal Goddess is one of the top five supreme geniuses, a Godly Yang Realm cultivator. We really can't afford to provoke her."</p><p></p><p>"Speak!" Miu Lun suddenly shouted.</p><p></p><p>The subordinates flinched, and someone lowered his head and said in a muffled voice, "Young master, we can't afford to offend a supreme genius like the Blood Moon..."</p><p></p><p>Bam!</p><p></p><p>Miu Lun kicked him to the ground and cursed, "Trash! I've become a laughingstock, and if I don't vent this anger, how can I continue to live in the Ancient Desolate Royal City? If my father finds out about this, he'll definitely beat me up again for bringing shame to the Miu clan!"</p><p></p><p>The subordinates trembled in fear, not daring to speak.</p><p></p><p>"Hmph." Miu Lun snorted coldly, his eyes flashing, "The Blood Moon woman, she's just in the Godly Yang Realm, what's so great about that? Our Miu clan also has Godly Yang Realm cultivators..."</p><p></p><p>He was actually not afraid of the Blood Moon, but the forces behind her.</p><p></p><p>Unfortunately, the Blood Moon's origins were shrouded in mystery, and no one knew where she came from or what powers supported her. Even her real name was unknown.</p><p></p><p>The powerful factions in the royal city had investigated the Blood Moon's background, but they couldn't find anything.</p><p></p><p>The Blood Moon was like she had appeared out of thin air.</p><p></p><p>"Young master, but we don't know the Blood Moon's background. If we rashly make a move, it might..."</p><p></p><p>Before he could finish, he was slapped away by Miu Lun, letting out a miserable cry!</p><p></p><p>"You think your pig brain has considered everything? Do you think I don't know that?" Miu Lun said coldly.</p><p></p><p>In just a short moment, two more subordinates were knocked unconscious by Miu Lun, making the remaining ones even more terrified. Their young master was truly ruthless.</p><p></p><p>"Even if the Blood Moon has a powerful background, so what? Don't forget, this is the Ancient Desolate Royal City. She won't be able to stir up any waves here."</p><p></p><p>Miu Lun's eyes flashed with a ruthless glint as he murmured, "As long as we do it secretly and kill her, won't that be fine?"</p><p></p><p>Seeming to remember something, a greedy look appeared in his eyes, and he chuckled, "Oh no, not kill her. I have to play with her first before killing her. Hehe, such a beautiful figure, it would be a waste to just kill her directly."</p><p></p><p>Hearing Miu Lun's crazy words, the subordinates were terrified, wishing they hadn't heard anything.</p><p></p><p>Heavens, their young master actually had evil intentions towards the fifth-ranked supreme genius!</p><p></p><p>"You all go find out the Blood Moon's address. You, go find the Steward. No, I'll go myself..."</p><p></p><p>Miu Lun quickly made his plans.</p><p></p><p>The Steward, as the Miu clan's major-domo, had cultivation in the middle Godly Yang Realm. He should be able to deal with that Blood Moon.</p><p></p><p>.........</p><p></p><p>At the same time, outside the Ancient Desolate Royal City.</p><p></p><p>A bald young man in a black robe arrived.</p><p></p><p>Li Shu Yan stared at the towering city gates, murmuring, "The Ancient Desolate Royal City... It's quite impressive. I wonder if the master has arrived yet."</p><p></p><p>He then quickly headed into the city.</p><p></p><p>His current task was to obtain the qualification to participate in the Supreme Genius Convention.</p><p></p><p>Li Shu Yan wove through the sea of people on the streets.</p><p></p><p>Here is the full English translation of the Chinese excerpt:</p><p></p><p>That shiny bald head was quite dazzling.</p><p></p><p>Countless discussions echoed around his ears.</p><p></p><p>"Haha, ever since the Appraisal Stone produced a supreme celestial genius, the overall level of this Celestial Genius Convention has been dragged down."</p><p></p><p>"It seems the Appraisal Stone hasn't emitted any white light beams these past few days, looks like there's no more supreme celestial geniuses, haha."</p><p></p><p>"Looking at it this way, this Celestial Genius Convention will most likely only have that one supreme celestial genius. I'm really curious what kind of skin that person has, to be able to withstand such immense pressure and still participate in the Celestial Genius Convention!"</p><p></p><p>"Do you guys know what that person's name is?"</p><p></p><p>This was asked by Li Shuyan.</p><p></p><p>The crowd looked blankly at the bald man who had walked up to them, and unanimously shook their heads, "Don't know."</p><p></p><p>Li Shuyan's brow furrowed slightly, "Do you know if there are any distinguishing features?"</p><p></p><p>For some reason, he had a premonition that this was most likely the Senior!</p><p></p><p>Only the Senior would take such an unconventional path.</p><p></p><p>"Hmm... let me think, that celestial genius was wearing a blue robe, right?"</p><p></p><p>Li Shuyan's eyes lit up, blue robe, good, that matches the Senior to some extent.</p><p></p><p>"Oh yes, that celestial genius was also wearing a bronze mask, haha, that little Kalamei, his cultivation isn't that great, but he has a certain air of mystery about him!"</p><p></p><p>"Haha haha!"</p><p></p><p>Hearing this, the few people around him also started laughing, that was quite amusing.</p><p></p><p>They didn't actually dislike that supreme celestial genius, to be honest, they quite liked him.</p><p></p><p>To participate in the Celestial Genius Convention with supreme celestial cultivation, how courageous! Definitely something they themselves couldn't do.</p><p></p><p>Moreover, these past few days, that supreme celestial genius has also brought them a lot of entertainment, well, something to discuss after meals.</p><p></p><p>A look of delight instantly appeared on Li Shuyan's face, that's it, that's it!</p><p></p><p>Wearing a blue robe, with a bronze mask, this must definitely be the Senior!</p><p></p><p>But very soon, his expression darkened as he said in a deep voice, "Funny, is it?"</p><p></p><p>The few people were stunned, looking at the bald man in confusion, not knowing what he meant.</p><p></p><p>"Hmph, I can't be bothered to argue with you bunch of short-sighted people."</p><p></p><p>Li Shuyan spat a sentence and quickly left.</p><p></p><p>The few people looked at each other, feeling disgruntled, what the hell was this bald guy's problem!</p><p></p><p>They were just explaining things in good faith, and he inexplicably threw them a nasty look?!</p><p></p><p>But the next moment, they saw the bald head turn back.</p><p></p><p>They saw him ask, "By the way, where is the Appraisal Stone?"</p><p></p><p>The few people dumbly pointed in the direction of the center, and then saw the bald head disappear in a flash.</p><p></p><p>"Huh? What's this bald guy up to? Is he going to try the Appraisal?"</p><p></p><p>"Let's go, let's go, I'm not happy with this stinky bald guy, if he doesn't have any real power, I'll beat him up!"</p><p></p><p>"..."</p><p></p><p>Soon, the few people quickly chased after towards the center of the royal city.</p><p></p><p>As soon as they arrived, they saw the bald head appear by the Appraisal Stone and place his palm on the stone ball.</p><p></p><p>The next moment, ten light beams lit up.</p><p></p><p>Nine yellow, one purple!</p><p></p><p>Wow!</p><p></p><p>The center of the royal city was in an uproar, another Celestial Yang Realm genius had appeared!!!</p><p></p><p>The few people who had followed Li Shuyan were also dumbfounded, their mouths gaping wide open like goose eggs.</p><p></p><p>When did Celestial Yang Realm geniuses become so easily encountered?!</p><p></p><p>"Who is that bald guy? Among the top ten in the hot rankings, I've never heard of anyone being bald!"</p><p></p><p>"I-I don't know, this Celestial Genius Convention is truly full of hidden dragons and crouching tigers!"</p><p></p><p>"Quick, quick, go curry favor with him, get on his good side. If he makes it to the top ten, he'll become one of the sword disciples of the Ancient Desolate Sword Clan!"</p>

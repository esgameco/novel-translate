        <h1>Chapter 123</h1>
        <div class="content">
            <p>Here is the full English translation of the Chinese excerpt:</p><p></p><p>Receiving the message from the Old Turtle, Chu Lingian and the other three were startled!</p><p></p><p>They unanimously sent a message to the Old Turtle, asking, "Which direction?"</p><p></p><p>In their minds, the Five Great Immortal Realms were so vast, and the Yuxiong Demon Clan was after all just a single clan, no matter how numerous they were, they couldn't be that powerful. It was most likely an attack from a single direction, not multiple directions or a surrounding formation.</p><p></p><p>In the Immortal Emperor Palace of the Central Immortal Realm, the Old Turtle raised his eyebrows. Of course, he understood the meaning of the four Immortal Emperors, and immediately transmitted a message in a solemn voice: "You are mistaken. It's not just a single direction, the Yuxiong Demon Clan is quite numerous... Although they are far from being able to form a surrounding formation, they can still attack from two directions. According to my perception, it should be in the Eastern Immortal Realm of Chu Lingian and the Southern Immortal Realm of Gu Yinyang."</p><p></p><p>Upon hearing this, the four Immortal Emperors furrowed their brows. They suddenly recalled the scene of devastation they had seen in the Heavenly Mirror, and their hearts were gripped with anxiety!</p><p></p><p>Seeing the four Immortal Emperors fall silent for a moment, with Lu Changsheng not present, the Old Turtle, as the backbone, immediately issued an order!</p><p></p><p>"You must quickly issue the Immortal Emperor Decree to gather the powerful experts from all realms, and assemble them at the borders of the Eastern Immortal Realm and the Southern Immortal Realm!"</p><p></p><p>"Phoenix Nine, come with me to the Eastern Immortal Realm of Lingian, and Wushi, go to the Southern Immortal Realm of Yinyang!"</p><p></p><p>Seeing the Old Turtle wanting to go help the Eastern Immortal Realm, Gu Yinyang and Shi Wushi became somewhat nervous!</p><p></p><p>What should they do...</p><p></p><p>There was no choice, they had heard that the peak combat power of the Yuxiong Demon Clan included not less than ten Immortal Emperor realm experts! With just the two of them, how could they possibly defend against that...</p><p></p><p>"Old Turtle, as for the Southern Immortal Realm, with just me and Shi Wushi, I'm afraid it will be very difficult to hold them off..." Gu Yinyang said in a solemn voice.</p><p></p><p>The Old Turtle said with some irritation, "What are you afraid of? Giving up before the battle even starts? Didn't I say that there's also Hunqiu? The Five Great Immortal Realms are our home turf. You wield the Immortal Emperor Decree and mobilize the Immortal Emperor power of the Southern Immortal Realm to build a defensive barrier, that should be enough to hold out until Hunqiu arrives!"</p><p></p><p>"Alright."</p><p></p><p>Gu Yinyang had no more words after hearing this. He naturally understood the power of the Immortal Emperors in the Immortal Realms, but if Hunqiu were to arrive even a step late, and the Immortal Emperor power was broken through by the Yuxiong Demon Clan, the Southern Immortal Realm could be in grave danger!</p><p></p><p>Concerning the lives of countless beings in the Southern Immortal Realm, as the Yin-Yang Immortal Emperor of the Southern Immortal Realm, he couldn't help but worry.</p><p></p><p>Moreover, his lifespan was running short. He feared that he might not be able to maintain the Immortal Emperor power of the Southern Immortal Realm for too long...</p><p></p><p>"Alright, that's it! You all go down and make the arrangements! Since the Master is not here now, then I am the strongest. You all do as I say!"</p><p></p><p>After saying this, the Old Turtle suddenly waved his hand, cutting off the transmission!</p><p></p><p>Just now, when talking to the four Immortal Emperors, he had actually been quite solemn in his heart, after all, the Yuxiong Demon Clan was truly powerful...</p><p></p><p>Immediately afterwards, he flashed and appeared outside Lu Changsheng's Immortal Emperor's residence.</p><p></p><p>Lu Changsheng's residence was somewhat different from the other four Immortal Emperors' luxurious and magnificent ones, being more simple.</p><p></p><p>"Old Turtle!!"</p><p></p><p>The servants guarding the residence were startled, and quickly bowed down.</p><p></p><p>"Oh, it's nothing, you all just continue with your work!"</p><p></p><p>The Old Turtle casually waved his hand and hurriedly ran into the residence, his old eyes scanning around, as if looking for something.</p><p></p><p>Soon, his gaze stopped at the foot of Lu Changsheng's bed, where a shining token was placed...</p><p></p><p>The Immortal Emperor Decree!</p><p></p><p>The Old Turtle's eyes lit up, and he gestured towards the Immortal Emperor Decree.</p><p></p><p>But the Immortal Emperor Decree did not respond at all, still firmly placed at the foot of the bed.</p><p></p><p>The Old Turtle's face darkened as he shouted, "Don't you recognize Grandpa Turtle? Since the Master is not here now, a great calamity is befalling the Immortal Realms. You'd better obey quickly, or else when the Master returns, I'll see how he deals with you!!"</p><p></p><p>As the words fell, the Immortal Emperor Decree started to tremble and flew out from the foot of the bed, landing in the Old Turtle's hand.</p><p></p><p>On it were countless intricate patterns intertwined, with the word "Changsheng" engraved in the center.</p><p></p><p>Holding the Immortal Emperor Decree, the Old Turtle felt...</p><p></p><p>Here is the full English translation of the Chinese excerpt:</p><p></p><p>Stirred by the vibration of the Immortal Emperor's decree, the ancient turtle took a light breath and spoke in a low voice:</p><p></p><p>"I am the sole mount of the Immortal Emperor, the Undying Celestial Turtle. The great calamity of the Immortal Realm has arrived, and the Abyssal Demonic Clan is about to invade. On the orders of my master, I hold the Immortal Emperor's decree and summon the mighty cultivators of the Central Immortal Realm!"</p><p></p><p>"The Three Great Immortal Sages of the Central Immortal Realm hear the call. They shall mobilize the powerful cultivators above the Dao Realm to reinforce the Eastern Immortal Realm and the Southern Immortal Realm!"</p><p></p><p>"This matter concerns the very existence of the Immortal Realm. Any who disobey will be swiftly executed by the Three Great Immortal Sages!"</p><p></p><p>The voice of the ancient turtle, empowered by the Immortal Emperor's decree, resounded through the palace of the Eternal Immortal Emperor and echoed in the ears of the countless Dao Realm Immortals of the Central Immortal Realm.</p><p></p><p>For the first time in a million years, the palace of the Eternal Immortal Emperor issued a decree.</p><p></p><p>They were all stunned. The Eternal Immortal Emperor had returned?</p><p></p><p>But soon, their nerves were tightly strained!</p><p></p><p>The great calamity of the Immortal Realm? The Abyssal Demonic Clan?!</p><p></p><p>What were these things...?</p><p></p><p>Yet they did not harbor the slightest doubt, for this was the Immortal Emperor's decree! They had to obey without question.</p><p></p><p>This was the reason why the ancient turtle and the Four Great Immortal Emperors had not informed the various realms about the Abyssal Demonic Clan earlier. Whether they were told or not, it did not matter, for the moment the Immortal Emperor's decree was issued, they would instantly rally.</p><p></p><p>This was the supreme authority of the Immortal Emperor in the Five Great Immortal Realms, let alone the Eternal Immortal Emperor himself.</p><p></p><p>"Go! To the Immortal Emperor's palace!"</p><p></p><p>Instantly, countless powerful cultivators above the Dao Realm from the various sects and lone cultivators in the vast expanse of the Central Immortal Realm sprang into action.</p><p></p><p>Since their ascension to the Dao Realm, a thread of their divine consciousness had been connected to the Immortal Emperor's decree in their respective Immortal Realms. The Immortal Emperor's orders could directly resonate in their minds, a precaution taken by the Five Great Immortal Realms in case of emergencies.</p><p></p><p>They hurriedly traversed the various teleportation formations to rush towards the palace of the Eternal Immortal Emperor.</p><p></p><p>If they were to travel normally, the distance would be too great, and they would not arrive in time.</p><p></p><p>At the same time, the same events were unfolding in the Eastern, Southern, Western, and Northern Immortal Realms. The Four Great Immortal Emperors, through the Immortal Emperor's decree, summoned the mighty cultivators to gather at the Immortal Emperor's palace, before marching in grand procession towards the borders of the Eastern and Southern Immortal Realms.</p><p></p><p>This highly unusual activity caused great unrest and speculation among the countless mortals of the Five Great Immortal Realms. They were all bewildered, unsure of what was happening, why the atmosphere had suddenly become so tense.</p><p></p><p>Until news spread that the foreign tribes were invading, and the great calamity of the Five Great Immortal Realms had arrived, with the foreign tribes about to reach the borders of the Eastern and Southern Immortal Realms.</p><p></p><p>This news was like a massive stone thrown into a pond, causing ripples to spread far and wide.</p><p></p><p>Among the Five Great Immortal Realms, especially in the Eastern and Southern Immortal Realms, countless ordinary people began to panic, though they did not descend into chaos. Instead, they quietly closed their doors and prayed in their hearts, daring not to venture outside.</p><p></p><p>Later, in the Langtiandomain, at the White Moon Sect...</p><p></p><p>"Elder Brother Gu, Elder Brother Gu, this is terrible!" Wu Che and Hai Dong rushed to the entrance of Gu Helin's dwelling, shouting in distress.</p><p></p><p>With a loud thud, the door opened, and Gu Helin emerged, his face full of resentment.</p><p></p><p>"You two senior brothers, I just finished mining, can't you let me cultivate in peace?" he sighed.</p><p></p><p>Hai Dong's face was slightly pale as he gave a wry smile. "Elder Brother Gu, you'd better not cultivate for now. There are foreign tribes invading, and the great calamity of the Immortal Realm has arrived. The people of all realms are in a state of panic, and countless powerful cultivators above the Dao Realm have begun to mobilize. It is said that the foreign tribes are attacking the Eastern Immortal Realm and our Southern Immortal Realm..."</p><p></p><p>"Our Langtiandomain is located on the outskirts, right at the edge of the vast desert. It is a prime location for the foreign tribes to attack from. They might very well invade from this direction!"</p><p></p><p>Upon hearing this, the color drained from Gu Helin's face.</p><p></p><p>He, how could he be so unlucky? He had just arrived in the Immortal Realm and had not even had the chance to fully experience its fragrance...</p>

        <h1>Chapter 174</h1>
        <div class="content">
            <p>Here is the full English translation of the Chinese excerpt:</p><p></p><p>After today, the Jiang Imperial Clan will no longer exist in the Heavenly Scars!</p><p></p><p>How dare you say such words!</p><p></p><p>Not only the Three Envoys of Wind, Fire, and Thunder, but even most other people in the world would find this utterly absurd, except for a few who have a slight understanding of Lu Changsheng. üê®üçü‚ûÖ‚ùæ≈üùî•·ªÆ‚ìß.Ôº£ùìûùïûüê§üêº</p><p></p><p>"Shamelessly boastful! The foundations of our Jiang Imperial Clan are something you cannot fathom."</p><p></p><p>"Could it be that you've gained some confidence by capturing our Three Envoys?"</p><p></p><p>The Wind Envoy and Fire Envoy successively shouted in a low voice.</p><p></p><p>As for the Thunder Envoy, he kept his head down and remained silent. He felt... since they had been captured, such arrogance was not appropriate, right?</p><p></p><p>Sure enough, the next moment, two slaps landed on their faces!</p><p></p><p>Slap slap.</p><p></p><p>Xing Tian shook his hand and looked at the Wind Envoy and Fire Envoy, coldly saying, "Are you not aware of your current situation?"</p><p></p><p>The Wind Envoy and Fire Envoy were slapped so hard that blood flowed from their seven orifices, their hair disheveled.</p><p></p><p>The Fire Envoy lowered his head and became a bit more docile, but the Wind Envoy, like a stubborn bone, raised his head and shouted fiercely, "Does this Envoy fear you? Even if I die, the Clan Leader will avenge me! From the moment you opposed our Jiang Imperial Clan, your fate was sealed!"</p><p></p><p>A murderous intent instantly appeared in Xing Tian's eyes,</p><p></p><p>but Lu Changsheng stopped him, and mysteriously smiled, "Avenge? Do not think that my previous words were just a joke... I, Lu Changsheng, always keep my word."</p><p></p><p>As he spoke, he suddenly stretched out his hand and grasped at the void.</p><p></p><p>Everyone was stunned.</p><p></p><p>But very soon, everyone's complexion changed.</p><p></p><p>Suddenly, a vague, gigantic hand appeared in the vast sky!</p><p></p><p>The space in front of the gigantic hand was easily pierced, as if it were just paper!</p><p></p><p>Afterward, the gigantic hand disappeared into the space...</p><p></p><p>Leaving only a huge black hole in the sky.</p><p></p><p>What... what does this mean?</p><p></p><p>Everyone's nerves were tightly strained for some unknown reason...</p><p></p><p>The Wind, Fire, and Thunder Envoys were even dumbfounded.</p><p></p><p>At the same time,</p><p></p><p>In the distant Holy Immortal Realm of the Heavenly Scars, the territory of the Jiang Imperial Clan.</p><p></p><p>The sky suddenly let out a loud boom!</p><p></p><p>Many of the Jiang Imperial Clan's disciples had their eardrums shaken, and they quickly looked up at the sky. Upon seeing it, their pupils gradually shrank...</p><p></p><p>Apart from the eternal abyss of the Rift, a huge black hole had also appeared in the sky!</p><p></p><p>"What... what is this??"</p><p></p><p>"What's going on, this black hole is so big, when did the space of our Heavenly Scars become so fragile?"</p><p></p><p>"The sound was so loud, I'm sure the Clan Leader and the Elders have heard it too. They have deep experience, maybe they'll know."</p><p></p><p>"..."</p><p></p><p>The Jiang Imperial Clan's disciples discussed in confusion, their expressions filled with doubt. They had never seen such a scene before.</p><p></p><p>On the other side,</p><p></p><p>On a relatively high mountain peak, the figures of Jiang Wuji and the Elders appeared.</p><p></p><p>They looked up at the huge black hole in the sky with grave expressions.</p><p></p><p>"Clan Leader, this is a space fracture, but it was fine just now... what is this exactly?" said an Elder with a frown.</p><p></p><p>The space of the Heavenly Scars was extremely solid, ordinary Immortal Emperors would find it difficult to cause any damage.</p><p></p><p>Let alone such a huge black hole!</p><p></p><p>The Elders' eyes flickered, for some unknown reason, a sense of oppression filled their hearts.</p><p></p><p>Jiang Wuji stared intently at the black hole and said in a deep voice, "Let me go take a look..."</p><p></p><p>But before he could finish his words!</p><p></p><p>A vague, gigantic hand suddenly extended out from the black hole in the sky!!</p><p></p><p>The gigantic hand spread its five fingers, growing larger and larger, until it was large enough to cover the entire Jiang Imperial Clan's territory!</p><p></p><p>At this moment, the sky above the Jiang Imperial Clan had turned dark!</p><p></p><p>The next instant, the gigantic hand brought about a violent airflow and pressed down ruthlessly!</p><p></p><p>In an instant...</p><p></p><p>Here is the full English translation of the excerpt from the Chinese novel:</p><p></p><p>Suddenly, the territory of the Jiang clan imperial family was filled with cries of alarm, and all the disciples stared in shock at the boundless darkness in the sky!</p><p></p><p>They knew that it was not darkness, but a hand!</p><p></p><p>A giant hand that covered their entire space and territory!</p><p></p><p>Panic, horror, and helplessness immediately permeated the Jiang clan imperial family!</p><p></p><p>Jiang Wuji's pupils contracted as he watched this scene. During his tenure as the clan leader of the Jiang clan, such an unimaginable disaster had never occurred!</p><p></p><p>He knew that a supremely powerful expert had set their sights on the Jiang clan imperial family!</p><p></p><p>But why would such a powerful expert choose to attack the Jiang clan imperial family out of the blue?</p><p></p><p>At this moment, the situation was extremely urgent, and he had no time to ponder further.</p><p></p><p>The opponent's attack had already taken shape, and there was no time to disperse that towering hand. </p><p></p><p>He must block it first!</p><p></p><p>Without hesitation, he flipped his hand and a jade token appeared, into which he frantically poured surging spiritual energy. A mighty roar suddenly resounded throughout the Jiang clan territory:</p><p></p><p>"First-grade Clan Defense Formation, activate!"</p><p></p><p>Hum hum hum...!</p><p></p><p>A frequency that could shatter eardrums echoed through the heavens and earth.</p><p></p><p>Suddenly, seven beams of light in the colors of red, orange, yellow, green, blue, indigo, and violet burst forth from different directions of the Jiang clan territory, connecting to form a massive rainbow-colored arc that enveloped and protected the Jiang clan's domain.</p><p></p><p>Instantly, everyone let out a sigh of relief, a strong sense of security enveloping them.</p><p></p><p>After all, this was the first-grade Clan Defense Formation of the Jiang clan, personally commanded by the clan leader!</p><p></p><p>There were also second-grade and third-grade formations, all under the control of the elders.</p><p></p><p>The elders also calmed down, with one elder even looking at the approaching towering hand and frowning, saying, "Clan leader, using the first-grade Clan Defense Formation directly, isn't that a bit too much respect for this hand?"</p><p></p><p>The other elders silently nodded in agreement, for the first-grade Clan Defense Formation could only be used once every ten thousand years. What if something happened during that time?</p><p></p><p>Jiang Wuji frowned and said, "Shut up! You don't understand. This sudden attack is definitely not that simple. If it causes any harm to the members of our Jiang clan, are you willing to take responsibility?"</p><p></p><p>The elders fell silent, looking up at the descending towering hand. Now that the first-grade Clan Defense Formation had been activated, they were no longer panicked, but felt a bit of a waste.</p><p></p><p>The sky grew increasingly gloomy, and if not for the multicolored light emanating from the Clan Defense Formation, it would have been pitch black.</p><p></p><p>Finally, the towering hand descended upon the Clan Defense Formation.</p><p></p><p>Crack...</p><p></p><p>The so-called first-grade Clan Defense Formation did not even last a moment before shattering into pieces.</p><p></p><p>The elders: "..."</p><p></p><p>Jiang Wuji's heart pounded violently, his expression one of utter disbelief!</p><p></p><p>How could this be possible!</p><p></p><p>"Clan leader! Elders!!"</p><p></p><p>The Jiang clan territory once again descended into panic.</p><p></p><p>Jiang Wuji's face turned a dark purple, his teeth grinding.</p><p></p><p>"Elders, follow me to resist!"</p><p></p><p>"Yes!"</p><p></p><p>A massive black-tinged sword appeared in Jiang Wuji's hand behind him, ready to take action.</p><p></p><p>But the speed of the towering hand suddenly increased!</p><p></p><p>Boom!</p><p></p><p>Five giant fingers viciously plunged into the ground, like a celestial prison!</p><p></p><p>The heavens and earth fell silent at that moment.</p><p></p><p>Jiang Wuji and the others were slightly stunned, looking around in doubt at the five giant fingers that seemed to connect the heavens and earth... They were now in the palm of that hand.</p><p></p><p>What did this mean? It was not going to strike them?</p><p></p><p>Suddenly!</p><p></p><p>The five giant fingers swiftly closed in!</p><p></p><p>Grabbing the entire Jiang clan territory and retracting it towards the black abyss in the sky!!</p><p></p><p>All the people's faces were filled with horror!</p><p></p><p>Jiang Wuji was dumbfounded. This... What kind of divine ability was this?</p><p></p><p>It was going to move the entire Jiang clan imperial family...!</p>

        <h1>Chapter 296</h1>
        <div class="content">
            <p>Here is the full English translation of the Chinese excerpt:</p><p></p><p>What?!</p><p></p><p>The faces of Fu Shiyu and the other two turned deathly pale, utterly shocked and horrified!</p><p></p><p>The Eight Great Ancient Clans were already extremely distant and unattainable for them. Yet the senior just said that the blood moon they saw earlier was a high-ranking Saint Maiden of the Ancient Moon Blood Clan?!</p><p></p><p>This was like a bolt from the blue for them!</p><p></p><p>That senior... </p><p></p><p>Just how much courage did he have to dare take the Saint Maiden of the Ancient Moon Blood Clan as a maid?üçì‚òØ69Shu.comüçßüêä</p><p></p><p>Seeing the three stunned on the spot, Lu Changsheng shook his head and said no more, closing his eyes to rest peacefully, feeling very at ease.</p><p></p><p>For him, leisurely exploring while finding his enemies was simply delightful. He was in no hurry at all, for he had all the time in the world.</p><p></p><p>If one were to quickly complete limited matters in infinite time, that would be too boring.</p><p></p><p>...</p><p></p><p>Meanwhile, in the depths of the Ancient Wasteland Royal City, the Miu Clan.</p><p></p><p>Miu Hantian and a group of elders were seated around a crystal-clear giant stone.</p><p></p><p>"Are the elders ready?" Miu Hantian asked solemnly.</p><p></p><p>Using the Mysterious Heaven Stone to deduce the culprit who killed Lun'er was somewhat difficult, as there were no clues so far. </p><p></p><p>Fortunately, there was a scope - the Sand Secrets Realm. If they couldn't even find the scope, it would be truly difficult.</p><p></p><p>"Yes, Clan Leader, let us begin," the elders replied gravely.</p><p></p><p>Seeing this, Miu Hantian nodded, took out Lun'er's life jade, and pushed it onto the Mysterious Heaven Stone in front of him.</p><p></p><p>He then intoned deeply, "Begin the seals!"</p><p></p><p>In the next moment, the elders began to swiftly form seals with their hands, the spiritual energy in their bodies flowing through the extraordinary meridians and converging in their palms.</p><p></p><p>Gradually, their hands began to emit faint multicolored lights.</p><p></p><p>At this time, Miu Hantian said in a focused voice, "Activate the stone!"</p><p></p><p>The elders slapped their palms onto the Mysterious Heaven Stone.</p><p></p><p>At the same moment, the life jade of Lun'er on the Mysterious Heaven Stone began to vibrate gently, and a strange aura flowed from the jade into the stone.</p><p></p><p>The Mysterious Heaven Stone was silent for a moment, then suddenly erupted in a dazzling white light, as if it had transported Miu Hantian and the others into a world of pure white.</p><p></p><p>They strained their eyes, trying to see clearly through the blinding white light.</p><p></p><p>...</p><p></p><p>"Hmm?" </p><p></p><p>In the Sand Secrets Realm, Lu Changsheng's brow furrowed slightly. So someone dared to pry into him.</p><p></p><p>He then released all his spiritual awareness, allowing it to enter that white world.</p><p></p><p>At the same time,</p><p></p><p>Miu Hantian and the elders stared intently at the white world in front of them, their faces slightly pale from the strain. Their eyes were starting to ache.</p><p></p><p>Just as Miu Hantian was about to give up temporarily,</p><p></p><p>"Clan Leader!! There's movement!!" an elder exclaimed excitedly.</p><p></p><p>Miu Hantian was immediately energized, looking over.</p><p></p><p>In the white world, ripples suddenly appeared, as if the white mist was churning.</p><p></p><p>Then, a figure in blue robes wearing a bronze mask appeared before their eyes.</p><p></p><p>Miu Hantian and the others were dumbfounded!!</p><p></p><p>This, this, this was the Immortal Emperor Realm prodigy, wasn't it?</p><p></p><p>They had a very strong impression of this person. Not only them, but anyone present in the Sand Secrets Realm should be familiar with this Immortal Emperor Realm prodigy!</p><p></p><p>After all, in the entire Prodigy Conference, there was only this one Immortal Emperor Realm prodigy!</p><p></p><p>So what was going on here? </p><p>Was that useless Lun'er killed by an Immortal Emperor Realm expert?</p><p></p><p>Miu Hantian and the others immediately cut off their wandering thoughts, their eyes narrowing.</p><p></p><p>It seems this so-called Immortal Emperor Realm prodigy is no simple matter...</p><p></p><p>Now that they know, it's easy. </p><p></p><p>What they need to do now is to withdraw from the white world of the Mysterious Heaven Stone and wait for the end of the Sand Secrets Realm before going to trouble this prodigy.</p><p></p><p>Previously, they were a bit worried that it was the Evil Exterminator, Southern Palace Wenxin, who killed their Lun'er. Now that they know who the culprit is, they heaved a sigh of relief.</p><p></p><p>After that thought, Miu Hantian took one last look at the figure in blue robes in front of him, then wanted to lead the elders out of the Mysterious Heaven Stone.</p><p></p><p>But the next moment, Miu Hantian and the elders' expressions changed slightly.</p><p></p><p>What's going on? They had already cut off their spiritual energy, so why couldn't they exit the Mysterious Heaven Stone?</p><p></p><p>"What are you trying to pry into me for?" </p><p></p><p>At this moment, a faint voice suddenly sounded in the white world.</p><p></p><p>This really startled Miu Hantian and the others.</p><p></p><p>"Who is it?!"</p><p></p><p>Miu Hantian abruptly scanned his surroundings, instinctively letting out a low roar.</p><p></p><p>Here is the full English translation of the Chinese excerpt:</p><p></p><p>The crowd slowly turned their gaze towards Lu Changsheng, their expressions gradually becoming strained...</p><p></p><p>Could it be...?</p><p></p><p>Lu Changsheng slowly walked towards them, his voice like a ghostly apparition: "Who did you say? Wasn't it you all who wanted to pull me in? I've come in as you wished."</p><p></p><p>Miao Hantian and the others immediately shrank back like frightened rabbits, their steps involuntarily retreating!</p><p></p><p>They looked unbelievingly at the bronze mask in front of them, unable to understand how this person could speak...</p><p></p><p>The Xuantian Stone should not be like this, there had never been such a situation before.</p><p></p><p>That could only mean one thing - they had stepped on a major landmine.</p><p></p><p>The 'Immortal Emperor Realm' before them was a super expert who was toying with them!</p><p></p><p>This was not something the Miao Clan could provoke!</p><p></p><p>If they had known it would be this kind of situation, who would still stubbornly court death?</p><p></p><p>"Senior... it's a misunderstanding, a misunderstanding!" </p><p></p><p>Miao Hantian and the others slowly backed away while bowing, their faces filled with trepidation, as if constipated.</p><p></p><p>Soon, Lu Changsheng arrived before them.</p><p></p><p>Miao Hantian and the others hurriedly knelt down in fear!</p><p></p><p>Lu Changsheng looked down at them and smiled: "A misunderstanding? Wasn't it because I killed your son that you wanted to find me?"</p><p></p><p>"Senior, you misunderstand!" Miao Hantian's scalp tingled, and then his face twisted with loathing and immense fury:</p><p></p><p>"It must be that beast who provoked the senior first, that little beast deserved to die!!"</p><p></p><p>"This time we wanted to find the senior mainly to admire the senior's demeanor, and to express our gratitude to the senior!"</p><p></p><p>"Hantian's mistake in raising such a son is also a fault, Hantian will punish himself!"</p><p></p><p>Saying this, in the dumbfounded gaze of the elders, he slapped his own chest, causing his entire chest to cave in!</p><p></p><p>At the same time, the main body of Miao Hantian outside also suddenly coughed up a mouthful of fresh blood!</p><p></p><p>Miao Hantian's series of actions made even Lu Changsheng raise his eyebrows.</p><p></p><p>"Senior, is this enough? If you still feel unsatisfied, Hantian will atone with his death!"</p><p></p><p>Miao Hantian said weakly.</p><p></p><p>"Clan Leader!" The elders were shocked by this.</p><p></p><p>"Forget it, I won't bother with you anymore, take care of yourselves."</p><p></p><p>Lu Changsheng suddenly lost interest and slowly disappeared from before Miao Hantian and the others.</p><p></p><p>"Farewell, senior, please come visit the Miao Clan of Hantian whenever you have time!"</p><p></p><p>Miao Hantian was overjoyed, and quickly led the elders in paying their respects to see him off.</p><p></p><p>Moments later, by the Xuantian Stone in the outside world.</p><p></p><p>Miao Hantian and the others regained their composure and removed their hands from the Xuantian Stone.</p><p></p><p>The group had pale faces, their hearts still filled with lingering fear.</p><p></p><p>Just now, the Miao Clan had truly walked to the gates of the underworld.</p><p></p><p>"Phew..."</p><p></p><p>"Clan Leader, what about the young master's matter?" An elder asked hoarsely.</p><p></p><p>Miao Hantian was suddenly startled, looking around in horror, and then roared at the elder:</p><p></p><p>"What do you mean 'what to do'! That beast provoked the senior, it's a blessing that he's dead! The senior didn't hold us Miao Clan accountable, that's a huge grace! What else do you want to do!"</p><p></p><p>The elder was sprayed with Miao Hantian's saliva mixed with blood, and he dared not speak anymore. The other elders also did not dare to speak.</p><p></p><p>Seeing this, Miao Hantian also calmed down a bit. He wiped the blood stains from the corner of his mouth and said in a low voice,</p><p></p><p>"Lun'er's matter is over, that senior is someone the Miao Clan cannot provoke. If you don't want the Miao Clan to be destroyed by him, you'd better all be cautious with your words and actions!"</p><p></p><p>The elders fell silent. Of course they knew, that person who could detect the probing and make his divine sense descend on the Xuantian Stone from the Sand Secret Realm, his terrifying strength was self-evident.</p><p></p><p>Miao Hantian slowly stood up, his face grave as he sighed:</p><p></p><p>"With such a powerful expert secretly descending on the Ancient Wasteland Arena... our Clan Leader has a premonition that this session of the Arena of Heavenly Champions may encounter trouble."</p><p></p><p>"And if my guess is correct, that senior should be from one of the other eight ancient clans, coming to the Ancient Wasteland, probably related to the Ancient Wasteland Sword Clan..."</p><p></p><p>"The disputes and grudges between the eight ancient clans, we small ants should just mind our own business."</p><p></p><p>Hearing this, the elders were slightly startled, but not overly surprised.</p><p></p><p>Just now in the Xuantian Stone, they had already vaguely guessed that the person was from one of the eight ancient clans.</p><p></p><p>It seems that the eight ancient clans are not in harmony either.</p><p></p><p>Miao Hantian looked at the group and said indifferently, "Forget about today's events, if this gets out, our Miao Clan will be finished!"</p><p></p><p>"Yes!"</p>

        <h1>Chapter 504</h1>
        <div class="content">
            <p>Here is the full English translation of the Chinese excerpt:</p><p></p><p>The four walls of waves on all sides of this continent were pressing down like the heavens collapsing!</p><p></p><p>This apocalyptic scene caused a sense of despair to appear in everyone's eyes.</p><p></p><p>Facing the four walls of waves, the crowd was like ordinary people, able only to watch helplessly as they came crashing down.</p><p></p><p>There was really nothing they could do, after all, their proud law attacks had no effect on the walls of waves at all.</p><p></p><p>Many cultivators wanted to escape by fleeing through the air, but when they saw the Sea Emperor standing there, they immediately abandoned that idea.</p><p></p><p>The scene of the four Profound Realm experts from the Sea Merchant Guild being instantly defeated was still fresh in their minds.</p><p></p><p>"Elder, what are we going to do, what are we going to do!" </p><p></p><p>The Valley Master of the Exorcism Valley said bitterly as he held the critically injured Elder.</p><p></p><p>Many other cultivators also turned their hopeful gazes towards the other three Profound Realm experts.</p><p></p><p>In response, the injured Sea Merchant Guild members could only smile bitterly, looking up at the Sea Emperor in the sky, their eyes flashing with deep fear!</p><p></p><p>After all, being described as "instantly defeated" was not an exaggeration for them.</p><p></p><p>They had also thought of Lu Changsheng, but the feeling the Sea King gave them was even stronger!</p><p></p><p>As the four walls of waves were about to collapse, the Sea King laughed arrogantly:</p><p></p><p>"My children, prepare for a frenzy of slaughter!"</p><p></p><p>From behind the waves, the response of countless sea monsters rang out, making the crowd even more desperate!</p><p></p><p>Rumble, rumble, rumble...</p><p>Crack, crack, crack...</p><p></p><p>Suddenly, the four gigantic walls of waves that were about to collapse the next moment instantly froze, freezing in place, shimmering in the sunlight, magnificent.</p><p></p><p>Not only the four walls of waves, but all the seawater in the Sea of Laws was frozen at that moment!</p><p></p><p>That is to say, the Eternal Night Island and the Ascension Island were also encased in ice.</p><p></p><p>All the cultivators scattered throughout the Sea of Laws were shocked to see the frozen sea.</p><p></p><p>They did not know how vast the Sea of Laws was, nor how deep, but today it had been frozen?</p><p></p><p>This was the Sea of Laws, the ocean that nurtured the laws!</p><p></p><p>Even if one had mastered the Dao of Ice to the extreme, even if one had comprehended the Profound Mysteries to the extreme, it would be absolutely impossible to freeze an entire vast ocean!</p><p></p><p>What had happened in the Sea of Laws? With brilliant light in the front and the sea frozen in the back, every scene portended that a great event had occurred!</p><p></p><p>...</p><p></p><p>Huh?</p><p></p><p>The people of the various forces stared blankly at the frozen walls of waves, unable to recover.</p><p></p><p>Due to the angle, they could not see that the entire vast sea behind the walls of waves had been frozen.</p><p></p><p>At this time, the Sea Emperor present was the only one with an ugly expression on his face!</p><p></p><p>In addition to the ugliness, there was also shock and burning fighting intent in his eyes!</p><p></p><p>The people below the waves may not have seen it, but he, the Sea Emperor, saw it clearly!</p><p></p><p>The Sea of Laws had been frozen!</p><p></p><p>And the instigator...</p><p></p><p>"Come down."</p><p></p><p>At this moment, a faint voice rang out on the continent.</p><p></p><p>Instantly, all eyes were drawn to the direction of the voice, which came from the east of the continent.</p><p></p><p>So the cultivators from the south, north, and west of the continent rushed frantically towards the east!</p><p></p><p>They wanted to see what had happened!</p><p></p><p>Only the high-level members of the factions who had been at the Elf Assembly could recognize that this was clearly the voice of the young man in blue!</p><p></p><p>...</p><p></p><p>On the eastern side of the continent.</p><p></p><p>Countless gazes converged on Lu Changsheng, their eyes flashing with shock.</p><p></p><p>The walls of waves had been frozen, and the cultivators had already guessed who was behind it!</p><p></p><p>The Valley Master of the Exorcism Valley and the Sect Master of the Abyss Underworld Palace snapped back to their senses, grasping at this lifeline like drowning men. The Valley Master hugged his Elder, trembling as he said:</p><p></p><p>"Th-this sea monster is called the Sea Emperor, and he has instantly defeated and critically injured our four Profound Realm experts, including my Elder!"</p><p></p><p>Lu Changsheng stood with his hands behind his back, not uttering a word.</p><p></p><p>Seeing this, the Valley Master dared not speak further, and he exchanged a silent glance with the Sect Master of the Abyss Underworld Palace.</p><p></p><p>But in their hearts, a glimmer of hope had been ignited!</p><p></p><p>At this moment, the Sea Emperor descended from the sky, his feet slamming heavily onto the land!</p><p></p><p>Boom!</p><p></p><p>The moment the Sea Emperor's soles touched the ground, the continent suddenly trembled, and spider-web-like cracks instantly spread across the entire landmass, causing the cultivators' pupils to tremble in fear.</p><p></p><p>This Sea Emperor had such a terrifying physical body!</p><p></p><p>Deathly silence fell over the scene.</p><p></p><p>The Sea Emperor stared at Lu Changsheng, taking steps forward, and with each step the continent shook.</p><p></p><p>Until he stopped just dozens of yards away from Lu Changsheng.</p><p></p><p>The Sea Emperor spoke indifferently, "You are not one of the Three Thousand Realms, are you?"</p><p></p><p>Lu Changsheng spoke softly, "Oh? You reptile are quite clever."</p><p></p><p>The Sea Emperor's expression suddenly turned ice-cold!!</p><p></p><p>How dare this person call him, the Sea Emperor, a reptile!!</p><p></p><p>At the edge of the continent, the cultivators gathered in increasing numbers, with those from the south, north, and west almost all arriving here. They watched the calm young man in blue with dry eyes!</p><p></p><p>It was this great man who had saved them all.</p><p></p><p>Here is the full English translation of the Chinese excerpt:</p><p></p><p>This continent... </p><p></p><p>Truly a remarkable person capable of freezing four towering waves, to actually refer to the mighty Deep Sea Emperor as a mere reptile...</p><p></p><p>Logically speaking, their Three Thousand Realms in the boundless void are already an extremely powerful world, yet it is surprising to find such a formidable expert within the Three Thousand Realms.</p><p></p><p>The cultivators frantically transmitted messages in the shadows, inquiring about his origins, and soon they all had a sudden realization, their spirits lifted!</p><p></p><p>It turns out that the downfall of the Chu Clan was orchestrated by this esteemed individual!</p><p></p><p>The cultivators recalled the colossal hand that had crushed the Chu Clan, and hope ignited in their hearts!</p><p></p><p>The Deep Sea Emperor's expression darkened as he said, "Since you are not from the Three Thousand Realms, aren't you meddling a bit too much?"</p><p></p><p>Lu Changsheng did not respond, but instead smiled faintly and said, "Are you very confident in the strength of your physical body?"</p><p></p><p>The Deep Sea Emperor's brow furrowed, and then he laughed arrogantly, "Of course! If the Emperor were to unleash a full-powered strike, not only this small continent, but the entire Three Thousand Realms would suffer damage!"</p><p></p><p>Hearing this, the countless cultivators present were greatly alarmed!</p><p></p><p>The Deep Sea Emperor, so terrifying!</p><p></p><p>The cultivators couldn't help but look at Lu Changsheng with worry. If Lu Changsheng were to be defeated, then what would become of them?</p><p></p><p>"That is indeed quite impressive," Lu Changsheng nodded, rolling up his sleeves with interest.</p><p></p><p>"However, it just so happens that my physical strength is also quite decent. How about we have a little sparring match?"</p><p></p><p>Ah?</p><p></p><p>The cultivators heard this and were greatly distressed. No, Your Excellency! They had witnessed four Dao Realm experts being easily defeated by the Deep Sea Emperor. Why would he want to compete in physical strength?</p><p></p><p>The cultivators did not understand!</p><p></p><p>The Deep Sea Emperor was taken aback for a moment, but then his eyes gleamed with excitement and battle intent as he licked his lips and sneered, "Good! That's wonderful! It's been years since I've been to the various worlds around the Three Thousand Realms, and they've all been too trash, unable to withstand a single punch from me!"</p><p></p><p>"Today, I hope you can give me some surprises!"</p><p></p><p>The Deep Sea Emperor finished speaking, and his gaze suddenly turned sharp as his figure vanished, intending to strike unexpectedly.</p><p></p><p>"Boom!"</p><p></p><p>Before the others could react, a deafening explosion rang out.</p><p></p><p>They looked over in trepidation and were horrified to see the Deep Sea Emperor's fist already slamming into Lu Changsheng's abdomen!</p><p></p><p>The cultivators turned pale with fear, wondering if the esteemed gentleman in the azure robe would also be defeated by the Deep Sea Emperor's punch.</p><p></p><p>However, the true situation was only known to the Deep Sea Emperor himself... No one had noticed the contraction of his pupils to the sharpness of needles.</p><p></p><p>"Crack, crack, crack, crack, crack, crack..."</p><p></p><p>Suddenly, a series of dense, crackling sounds of bones breaking rang out.</p><p></p><p>The cultivators looked over at the sound and were immediately struck with terror!</p><p></p><p>This dense, crackling sound of bones breaking was coming from the Deep Sea Emperor's right arm that had struck the gentleman in the azure robe's abdomen!</p><p></p><p>In the next moment, the bones in the Deep Sea Emperor's entire right arm were shattered, and the arm hung limply.</p><p></p><p>The Deep Sea Emperor slowly shifted his gaze, trembling as he looked at the calm and even slightly smiling gentleman before him, and a sudden fear arose in his heart, causing him to involuntarily take a step back.</p><p></p><p>Lu Changsheng looked at the Deep Sea Emperor and chuckled, "You don't even have the strength to hit someone, yet you dare to boast so arrogantly."</p><p></p><p>With that, he unleashed a punch.</p><p></p><p>"Boom!!"</p><p></p><p>In the Deep Sea Emperor's terrified gaze, his entire body suddenly exploded into nothingness!</p><p></p><p>The terrifying shockwave from the punch instantly rippled out like waves, causing the nearby sea region to violently tremble, the space shattering and peeling away layer by layer.</p><p></p><p>Under this shockwave, all the cultivators were blown away to a great distance, all the trees on the continent were snapped, and even the four frozen, towering waves were completely destroyed and collapsed.</p><p></p><p>It took a long time for the terrifying fluctuations to gradually subside.</p><p></p><p>The trembling cultivators slowly got up, kneeling on the ground and shivering.</p><p></p><p>Lu Changsheng looked at the surrounding devastation with an impassive expression, and then strode into the pitch-black space, soon disappearing from sight.</p><p></p><p>When the cultivators raised their heads, they found that the gentleman in the azure robe had vanished.</p><p></p><p>They panted heavily, collapsing to the ground, their bodies completely drained of strength.</p><p></p><p>The events that had occurred today were more shocking than anything they had experienced in their entire lives.</p><p></p><p>After recovering, the cultivators realized that the surrounding sea region had been frozen, and upon receiving various messages, they were even more stunned!</p><p></p><p>It turned out that not only the nearby sea region, but the entire Law Realm Sea had been frozen!</p><p></p><p>From then on, cultivators on the land who wished to comprehend the laws could directly walk on the ice to reach the Ascension Island in the Law Realm Sea, without any danger.</p><p></p><p>Of course, the shipping monopoly of the Sea Transport Guild had also been disrupted by Lu Changsheng's ice sealing, and there would no longer be any ships.</p><p></p><p>The Guild Master could only accept it, not daring to express any discontent.</p><p></p><p>After all, that nearly invincible gentleman in the azure robe had saved them all!</p>

        <h1>Chapter 366</h1>
        <div class="content">
            <p>Here is the full English translation of the Chinese excerpt:</p><p></p><p>The illusory great path suddenly erupted with dazzling light, humming and buzzing!</p><p></p><p>The people like Fang Yu and Mo Liang Qiu who had just entered were shocked and alarmed, looking around at the changes in the Perception Barrier. New 69 Book Bar 99 Shux.com</p><p></p><p>What happened?</p><p></p><p>At the same time,</p><p></p><p>After a moment of astonishment, the myriad races discussed animatedly, pointing and gesturing towards the continuously abnormal Perception Barrier!</p><p></p><p>"What's going on? Could it be that the nine humans have a divine abstruse realm hidden, trying to sneak through?"</p><p></p><p>"No, it's not like they haven't tried to sneak divine abstruse realms before, but the Perception Barrier back then didn't have such changes, it would just directly eliminate that divine abstruse realm."</p><p></p><p>"And you haven't noticed, it's been a while now, the Perception Barrier hasn't launched an attack, has it?"</p><p></p><p>"Then what's the situation?"</p><p></p><p>"I'm not sure, but I know that this scene is probably related to the last participant of the human race."</p><p></p><p>"Right, I saw it clearly, it was only when he stepped in that the Perception Barrier started changing, it couldn't be a coincidence......"</p><p></p><p>"......"</p><p></p><p>After Han Jinlong and Jiang Wuxin regained their senses, they heard the countless discussions of the myriad races and were dumbfounded in their hearts.</p><p></p><p>Could the changes in the Perception Barrier really be related to the Longevity Companion?</p><p></p><p>At this moment, whether it was the peak great clans or people like Zi Xuan Yong, they were all staring at the figure in blue with suspicion.</p><p></p><p>"Eh, how strange, the Perception Barrier hasn't even attacked that human, this shows that his realm should be compatible, what's going on?"</p><p></p><p>Bi Qiong puzzled.</p><p></p><p>He had voiced the confusion in the hearts of Shen Luo and Ao Xing.</p><p></p><p>As for people like Fang Yu, they stood in place, not daring to move.</p><p></p><p>Lu Changsheng stood with his hands behind his back, eyes closed, unaware of what he was doing.</p><p></p><p>Shen Luo glanced at the figure in blue, then suddenly looked towards Han Jinlong and Jiang Wuxin, and asked indifferently, "Who is the last one to enter your human race team?"</p><p></p><p>Jiang Wuxin and Han Jinlong were slightly shaken.</p><p></p><p>Jiang Wuxin stepped forward and bowed to Shen Luo, saying, "Your Highness, the last one to enter is our human race's Lu Nan, his realm is at the peak of the Divine Profound Realm, and the Perception Barrier has not launched an attack, which can serve as proof."</p><p></p><p>The implication was that they had no intention of sneaking through the Perception Barrier.</p><p></p><p>And the Perception Barrier was a means of the Seven-colored Crystal Pagoda, they didn't have the ability to sneak through it.</p><p></p><p>Lu Nan?</p><p></p><p>Hearing the surname Lu, Zi Xuan Yong and the others suddenly thought of that Lu Changsheng!</p><p></p><p>Their gaze was involuntarily focused on the figure in blue 'Lu Nan',</p><p></p><p>The more they looked, the more familiar it felt...</p><p></p><p>But that familiar feeling quickly vanished.</p><p></p><p>While the myriad races were exchanging glances, Lu Changsheng, who was inside the Perception Barrier, had already started chatting with the Pagoda Spirit of the Seven-colored Crystal Pagoda:</p><p></p><p>"What do you mean?"</p><p></p><p>"G-great... master."</p><p></p><p>"Just now when I stepped in, it seemed like you were about to attack me?"</p><p></p><p>"Master, there's no such thing, master, please come to the seventh layer, the little pagoda will apologize to you in person......"</p><p></p><p>"Mm."</p><p></p><p>When Lu Changsheng opened his eyes, the Perception Barrier immediately calmed down.</p><p></p><p>The myriad races looked at the restored calm Perception Barrier, as if the previous events were just an illusion.</p><p></p><p>They had never seen the Perception Barrier exhibit such abnormalities before, how strange.</p><p></p><p>"You, come out."</p><p></p><p>Suddenly, Shen Luo stared at Lu Changsheng from afar and said indifferently.</p><p></p><p>The changes in the Perception Barrier were most likely related to this person, he had to figure it out!</p><p></p><p>This Seven-colored Crystal Pagoda, even he...</p><p></p><p>Here is the full English translation of the Chinese excerpt:</p><p></p><p>The Godly Clan has coveted it for a long time!</p><p></p><p>The new 69 book bar 99shu.com</p><p></p><p>As the words of the Divine Luo fell, the myriad tribes fell silent!</p><p></p><p>Han Jinlong and Jiang Wuxin's eyes changed!</p><p></p><p>The Immortal Dao Companions have already entered the Sensing Barrier, and if they were to withdraw now, it would be impossible for them to re-enter the Seven-Colored Crystal Tower in a short time...</p><p></p><p>This is no different from losing their qualifications, which is absolutely unacceptable!</p><p></p><p>Jiang Wuxin bowed and said in a strained tone, "Divine Son, Lu Nan is the captain of our human race's participating team. Can you..."</p><p></p><p>But before he could finish,</p><p></p><p>Ao Xing quickly interrupted and said with a flickering gaze, "Divine Luo, this Holy Son knows what you want to do, but why not let this Lu Nan enter the Seven-Colored Crystal Tower first?"</p><p></p><p>"The Crystal Heart is important to any tribe, so why bother?" </p><p></p><p>"Moreover, after the Seven-Colored Crystal Tower is over, you can find Lu Nan again to question him. Why the hurry?"</p><p></p><p>Jiang Wuxin and Han Jinlong paused, not understanding why the Holy Son of the Dragon Tribe was speaking up for their human race.</p><p></p><p>Not only them, but even the myriad tribes present, including Divine Luo, Bi Qiong, and Feng Jun, all had strange expressions in their eyes.</p><p></p><p>Divine Luo's brow furrowed slightly as he turned to look at Ao Xing, puzzledly saying,</p><p></p><p>"Holy Son Ao Xing, why are you speaking up for the human race? If this Divine Son remembers correctly, the Dragon Tribe shouldn't have much to do with the human race, right?"</p><p></p><p>Ao Xing smiled faintly, "Indeed, it has nothing to do with us. What this Holy Son just said was just human nature."</p><p></p><p>Hearing this, Divine Luo's face was expressionless, and no one knew what he was thinking.</p><p></p><p>The atmosphere here became slightly tense, and Han Jinlong and Jiang Wuxin's heartbeats also quickened a bit.</p><p></p><p>If this Divine Luo insisted on the Immortal Dao Companions coming out today, they would have no way to resist.</p><p></p><p>If they resisted, it would give the Heavenly God Tribe a reason to annihilate the human race.</p><p></p><p>On the Battlefield of Gods and Demons, the strong devour the weak. They dare not provoke it...</p><p></p><p>At this time, in the Sensing Barrier, Fang Yin and the others were stiff, not daring to move rashly.</p><p></p><p>But Lu Changsheng was standing with his hands behind his back, looking very leisurely.</p><p></p><p>"Haha, what Holy Son Ao Xing said is correct. It seems this Divine Son didn't think it through."</p><p></p><p>Suddenly, Divine Luo laughed.</p><p></p><p>He had been silent just now, thinking. He still needed to give Ao Xing some face.</p><p></p><p>Besides this, there was another more important reason, which was that if the Heavenly God Tribe forcibly deprived a tribe of the Crystal Heart, it would inevitably arouse the dissatisfaction of the myriad tribes.</p><p></p><p>The dissatisfaction of the myriad tribes was not a big problem, they could only dare to be angry but not to speak out.</p><p></p><p>It's just that it wouldn't be good for the reputation of the Heavenly God Tribe.</p><p></p><p>Immediately, Jiang Wuxin and Han Jinlong heaved a sigh of relief, but there was little joy in their hearts.</p><p></p><p>There was only a sense of helplessness, of being manipulated at will.</p><p></p><p>"The Divine Son is wise!"</p><p></p><p>The myriad tribes also hurriedly praised.</p><p></p><p>Han Jinlong and Jiang Wuxin quickly signaled Fang Yin and the others not to linger and to enter the tower.</p><p></p><p>Fang Yin and the others nodded and walked towards the door of the Seven-Colored Crystal Tower, quickly entering one by one.</p><p></p><p>However, Lu Changsheng suddenly stopped in the midst of all eyes, turning around.</p><p></p><p>Huh?</p><p></p><p>The countless gazes of the myriad tribes looked at the human in blue with puzzlement, not understanding his intention.</p><p></p><p>Lu Changsheng's gaze fell on Divine Luo, and in Divine Luo's astonished gaze, he said, "After the Seven-Colored Crystal Tower is over, you want to find me?"</p><p></p><p>Huh?</p><p></p><p>Many gazes turned into astonishment, even trembling.</p><p></p><p>This human race doesn't want to live, talking to the Divine Son in such a tone... What does he want to do?</p><p></p><p>Ao Xing, Bi Qiong, Feng Jun and the others also furrowed their brows, looking at Lu Changsheng with disbelief.</p><p></p><p>As for Jiang Wuxin, Han Jinlong, and Zhao Di, their expressions changed drastically, looking at this scene in a fluster.</p>

        <h1>Chapter 175</h1>
        <div class="content">
            <p>Here is my translation of the Chinese excerpt you provided:</p><p></p><p>In the moment the giant hand retracted, the black hole suddenly burst open again, spreading crazily across the sky. üíó‚úé‚ûÖ‚ûàùìº–ΩœÖùîµ.ùì¨·µíÔº≠‚úåüëπ</p><p></p><p>Under the heavens, the once vast Jiang clan domain had disappeared...</p><p></p><p>Only a gaping chasm stretching for over a hundred thousand miles remained...</p><p></p><p>The Jiang imperial clan had been so abruptly excavated!</p><p></p><p>Both the people and the land!</p><p></p><p>At this moment, countless flickering shadows timidly appeared in the Jiang clan domain - they were cultivators from the nearby regions of the Jiang clan.</p><p></p><p>They had witnessed everything that had just happened to the Jiang clan domain.</p><p></p><p>Gazing at the boundless chasm, their eyes trembled and their minds were in chaos, feeling their very souls quivering.</p><p></p><p>The shock this had dealt them was truly too great, far exceeding their comprehension!</p><p></p><p>The entire Jiang imperial clan had been dug away!</p><p></p><p>They looked up at the heavens, seeing the massive black hole there, its size no different from the vanished Jiang clan domain.</p><p></p><p>Under this black hole, they felt like insignificant ants gazing up at the sky.</p><p></p><p>"Could it be... that the Jiang imperial clan had angered the Heavenly Dao, and this is the Heavenly Dao's hand?"</p><p></p><p>...</p><p></p><p>In the Black Calamity Domain, in Qingxuan Town.</p><p></p><p>Silence reigned over the heavens and earth.</p><p></p><p>Only the rustling of clothes in the strong wind could be heard.</p><p></p><p>All eyes were fixed unblinkingly on the black hole in the sky, silently waiting, their gazes flickering wildly.</p><p></p><p>They could not fathom the true meaning behind the innkeeper of the Longevity Tavern's move.</p><p></p><p>Could it be a long-distance strike against the Jiang imperial clan?</p><p></p><p>The Wind, Fire and Thunder Three Emissaries hung their heads in silence, but inwardly chuckling coldly.</p><p></p><p>Just then!</p><p></p><p>Some movement came from within the black hole in the sky.</p><p></p><p>Everyone's brows raised as they focused their utmost attention, gazing intently.</p><p></p><p>Crack!</p><p></p><p>The black hole suddenly burst open again, the space frantically shattering in all directions.</p><p></p><p>A massive clenched fist emerged from it.</p><p></p><p>Stretching out directly in the distant, it opened and placed down the Jiang imperial clan that extended over a hundred thousand miles, then dissipated.</p><p></p><p>Jiang Wuji was the first to flash out from within, appearing in the sky.</p><p></p><p>He swept his gaze around uncertainly - this was a place he had never been before, but it seemed somewhat similar to the Black Calamity Domain.</p><p></p><p>He frowned as he looked towards Qingxuan Town, then cupped his hands and addressed the void around him: "Which senior has moved my Jiang imperial clan here? If the Jiang clan has offended in any way, Wuji is willing to apologize."</p><p></p><p>Hearing this, everyone in Qingxuan Town was instantly petrified...</p><p></p><p>"Sss‚Äî"</p><p></p><p>"This... this is... Jiang Wuji, the patriarch of the Jiang clan?... "</p><p></p><p>"To have moved the entire imperial clan... and across such a vast distance... just who is the innkeeper?..."</p><p></p><p>The people in the heavens and earth all sharply inhaled, their scalps tingling, their spiritual souls trembling uncontrollably.</p><p></p><p>They had fallen into a state of great terror.</p><p></p><p>A terror that exceeded their comprehension!</p><p></p><p>Xing Tian and Peng Fang's faces were extremely rigid, as they looked at Lu Changsheng with great difficulty and bitterness.</p><p></p><p>They had underestimated, underestimated, and severely underestimated. </p><p></p><p>Lu Changsheng's level was far beyond their understanding.</p><p></p><p>Su Qianghe, Yin Jiuguai and the others were neither standing nor sitting, their palms sweating profusely. When the tavern had just opened, they had unknowingly circled the gates of the underworld...</p><p></p><p>As for Zuo Qianshen, after recovering from the shock, he stared fixatedly at Jiang Wuji!</p><p></p><p>This was the culprit who had killed his daughter!</p><p></p><p>"Qi Ran, this is your grandfather! The grandfather who killed your mother!!"</p><p></p><p>Zuo Qianshen transmitted this to the side, his emotions extremely unstable.</p><p></p><p>Qi Ran stared blankly at Jiang Wuji in the sky.</p><p></p><p>At the same time,</p><p></p><p>The Jiang imperial clan's elders appeared in the air, standing behind Jiang Wuji, their faces full of vigilance as they scanned their surroundings.</p><p></p><p>"Hmm? Patriarch, aren't those the Wind, Fire and Thunder Three Emissaries?"</p><p></p><p>A sharp-eyed elder quickly spotted the bound Three Emissaries and exclaimed in surprise.</p><p></p><p>Eh?</p><p></p><p>Jiang Wuji and the other elders quickly looked over, their expressions slightly perplexed.</p><p></p><p>"Patriarch! It's him! It's him!!"</p><p></p><p>At this moment, the Wind Emissary pointed at Lu Changsheng, shouting in terror.</p><p></p><p>Here is the full English translation of the Chinese excerpt:</p><p></p><p>"The innkeeper of the Longevity Inn is the one who moved our Jiang clan imperial family here!" </p><p></p><p>The terrified voice of the Wind Messenger echoed in the heavens and earth.</p><p></p><p>As for the other cultivators, whether suspended in the air, standing on the ground, or sitting cross-legged on the city walls, they all dared not to move.</p><p></p><p>Huh? The innkeeper of the Longevity Inn?!</p><p></p><p>This is... the Black Calamity Domain!</p><p></p><p>Jiang Wuji and the elders shuddered, finally fully reacting to the situation at this moment!</p><p></p><p>They abruptly looked towards the young man in blue robes behind the Wind, Fire, and Thunder Messengers!</p><p></p><p>Their gazes trembled uncontrollably...</p><p></p><p>From such a distant place, the one who moved their entire Jiang clan imperial family here... was actually him!</p><p></p><p>As the clan leader of the imperial family, Jiang Wuji had never felt as helpless as he did now.</p><p></p><p>He took a deep breath, and with a stiff smile in the shocked gazes of the crowd, he cupped his hands and said, "Senior, it is our Jiang clan imperial family... we failed to recognize you. This whole incident was just a misunderstanding. Jiang Chu and Jiang Chong have already died, and the Wind, Thunder, and Fire Messengers are also at your disposal. Afterwards, our Jiang clan imperial family will present you with a generous gift. How about we just let this matter go?"</p><p></p><p>Countless gazes flickered, not with mockery, but with admiration instead.</p><p></p><p>As the clan leader, he knew when to pick up and when to let go, and realizing they could not defeat him, he wanted to minimize the losses.</p><p></p><p>"Clan Leader!" </p><p></p><p>The Wind, Fire, and Thunder Messengers were stunned for a moment, feeling a sense of loss in their hearts, but then they soon became at ease.</p><p></p><p>This was the best approach.</p><p></p><p>As the clan leader, he had to consider the interests of the entire clan. They did not blame him.</p><p></p><p>Moreover, they also had their own descendants in the clan.</p><p></p><p>"Of course." </p><p></p><p>Without waiting for the crowd to be puzzled, without waiting for Jiang Wuji and the others to be delighted,</p><p></p><p>Lu Changsheng casually adjusted his sleeves and continued to smile, "But one matter for one matter, the old accounts still need to be settled. I said before that in the future, your Jiang clan imperial family will no longer exist... and I wasn't just saying it."</p><p></p><p>The Jiang clan imperial family no longer exist?!</p><p></p><p>Jiang Wuji and the others' pupils contracted, was he trying to exterminate their clan?</p><p></p><p>And when did their Jiang clan imperial family have any old accounts with this person?</p><p></p><p>"Haha." Jiang Wuji suddenly laughed, then abruptly shouted, "Wuji does not know what old accounts... Senior, do not go too far! Wuji respects you, but do not think that our Jiang clan imperial family can be bullied at will!"</p><p></p><p>Pushed to this point, he could no longer swallow his anger.</p><p></p><p>Lu Changsheng was unfazed, and suddenly said, "Let your ancestor come out."</p><p></p><p>Hearing this, Jiang Wuji's eyes blinked in disbelief, and the expressions of the three Messengers and the elders also became solemn.</p><p></p><p>At this moment,</p><p></p><p>From the territory of the Jiang clan imperial family behind them, a golden coffin flashing with light suddenly emerged and stood upright in the void!</p><p></p><p>Immediately, a violent scraping sound rang out, ear-piercing, as the coffin lid slid open.</p><p></p><p>An emaciated old man in a longevity robe slowly stood up and stepped out of the coffin.</p><p></p><p>"Ances...tor..."</p><p></p><p>Jiang Wuji and the others' faces changed slightly, and they hurriedly bowed in reverence.</p><p></p><p>In the heavens and earth, everyone in the crowd was suddenly shocked. This... this was the ancestor of the Jiang clan imperial family?</p><p></p><p>What cultivation realm must he be at, </p><p></p><p>Presumably, Jiang Wuji's confidence just now came from this longevity-robed old man...</p><p></p><p>The foundation of the imperial clan is indeed profound, with powerful experts emerging one after another.</p><p></p><p>Jiang Wuwu did not look at anyone, only staring silently at the young man in blue robes...</p><p></p><p>His turbid old eyes flickered, with shock and admiration in them, and he said, "Lu Changsheng... Old me is impressed."</p><p></p><p>Lu Changsheng smiled slightly: "You remember my name, but your name... I don't remember."</p><p></p><p>Jiang Wuwu was silent, pursing his dry lips and saying, "Old me's condition, I'm sure you can see it, a dying person... Old me participated in that matter, truly because my lifespan was limited, otherwise..."</p><p></p><p>In the heavens and earth, everyone listened in shock to the conversation between the two.</p><p></p><p>They realized that the innkeeper... really had a grudge with the Jiang clan ancestor!</p><p></p><p>That innkeeper was also a contemporary of the Jiang clan ancestor!</p><p></p><p>But the two, their conditions were vastly different!</p><p></p><p>At this time, Jiang Wuwu continued,</p><p></p><p>"This was all the mistake of one person, and has nothing to do with the countless disciples of my Jiang clan imperial family... They didn't even know about this matter... You see... can you not..."</p><p></p><p>"Cannot." </p><p></p><p>Lu Changsheng suddenly lost his smile and interrupted.</p><p></p><p>...</p><p></p><p>...</p><p></p><p>Wishing everyone a Happy New Year, a new journey, and a new partner in the new year.</p>

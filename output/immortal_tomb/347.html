        <h1>Chapter 347</h1>
        <div class="content">
            <p>Here is my translation of the Chinese excerpt:</p><p></p><p>Zhou Dafuk was perplexed, even he had been to the Earthly City and Heavenly City before. (¯`·.¸¸.·´¯`·.¸¸.-> 69book.com <-.¸¸.·´¯`·.¸¸.·´¯)</p><p></p><p>Could it be that Senior Qingyi had never been there before?</p><p></p><p>Unbelievable.</p><p></p><p>"Fellow Daoist Lu, surely you jest. The Three Cities of Heaven, Earth, and Man are the three core cities of the human realm, how could you have never been there? With your cultivation, it wouldn't take you too long to get there at full speed," Han Jinlong said, feeling a bit dissatisfied, feeling that Lu Changsheng was mocking him.</p><p></p><p>In the human realm, the Three Cities of Heaven, Earth, and Man form a triangle, serving an important protective function.</p><p></p><p>Ordinary cultivators traveling between the three cities takes some time, but most have been there.</p><p></p><p>Aside from the cultivators at the Shenxuan Realm and above in each city, the general population tends to be more transient, not fixed.</p><p></p><p>Lu Changsheng stated directly, "I've only recently arrived at the Divine-Demon Battlefield."</p><p></p><p>Ah?</p><p></p><p>Zhou Dafuk was stunned, how could that be?</p><p></p><p>But Han Jinlong paused, then shook his head and chuckled, suddenly understanding.</p><p></p><p>No wonder he had never heard of this Azure-robed cultivator in the human realm before - he had come from outside the Divine-Demon Battlefield.</p><p></p><p>This did not come as a great surprise to Han Jinlong.</p><p></p><p>Because the Divine-Demon Battlefield was not a closed-off world to begin with.</p><p></p><p>As the name suggests, it is simply a battlefield where all races contend, including the human race, who are not native to the Divine-Demon Battlefield.</p><p></p><p>They all came here long, long ago, because this world was very suitable for war.</p><p></p><p>This world was only named the Divine-Demon Battlefield after the arrival of the myriad races.</p><p></p><p>The human race did not have a large presence here initially, but gradually grew in numbers through reproduction, developing to its current scale.</p><p></p><p>Of course, the cultivators were initially unwilling to reproduce, as cultivators should seek immortality - why have children? But alas, the human race was inferior to the other races in many ways, so they could only rely on reproduction to increase their numbers and the possibility of producing a supreme talent.</p><p></p><p>Since they lacked in quality, they made up for it in quantity.</p><p></p><p>However, Han Jinlong was a bit puzzled - while the Divine-Demon Battlefield was not closed off, it was still relatively difficult to find. He wondered how this Fellow Daoist Lu had discovered it? Could it have been a chance encounter? That was certainly possible.</p><p></p><p>In any case, this newcomer must be kept in the Human City! </p><p></p><p>Before Mang Tian and those two fellows notice, he must act quickly.</p><p></p><p>As long as this Fellow Daoist Lu joins the Human City, the core combat power of the Human City should be able to surpass that of the Earthly City!</p><p></p><p>As for the Heavenly City, he didn't want to think about that, after all, it was under the command of the Sword Sovereign.</p><p></p><p>Currently, the cultivators at the Shenxuan Realm and above in the Human City are all on the battle rankings, including Miu Fan and Kong Zhen among the top thirty.</p><p></p><p>If he could add this Fellow Daoist Lu, the Human City would gain another core combat force at the Shenxuan Realm and above, hehe...</p><p></p><p>Moreover, this Fellow Daoist Lu's combat power is likely to easily squeeze into the top five of the Human City's battle rankings, hehe...</p><p></p><p>"I see, no wonder I've never heard of him before." Han Jinlong smiled knowingly.</p><p></p><p>He knew that this person, as a newcomer to the Divine-Demon Battlefield, was becoming more and more appealing to him.</p><p></p><p>Hehe, the Human City gains another great general!</p><p></p><p>Next time he sees Mang Tian and those two fellows, he'll be able to hold his head high.</p><p></p><p>"Come, Fellow Daoist Lu, have a drink!" Han Jinlong said, raising his cup with a smile.</p><p></p><p>Lu Changsheng slightly raised his cup, also giving a bit of face.</p><p></p><p>Here is the full English translation of the Chinese excerpt:</p><p></p><p>Seeing this, Han Jinlong tilted his head back and drank it all in one gulp. His eyes then flickered as he tentatively said:</p><p></p><p>"Fellow Daoist Lu, since you have just arrived at the Divine-Demonic Battlefield, you must not have heard of the Seven-Colored Jade Pagoda, have you?"</p><p></p><p>The Seven-Colored Jade Pagoda?! </p><p></p><p>Zhou Dafu beside him trembled. It had indeed been a long time since the last battle for the Jade Heart. Could it be that the Seven-Colored Jade Pagoda was about to start again?</p><p></p><p>Such momentous news was naturally very difficult for small cultivators like them to know about, unless an announcement was made.</p><p></p><p>Lu Changsheng did not rush to speak, but quietly looked at Han Jinlong, waiting for him to continue.</p><p></p><p>The old turtle had long since retracted into its shell and fallen asleep, its dull cries gradually fading.</p><p></p><p>Although Zhou Dafu had his head lowered, his ears were already perked up.</p><p></p><p>Han Jinlong gently rubbed his fingers and said, "The Seven-Colored Jade Pagoda is quite a grand event, and also a small gambit among the myriad tribes. Within the Seven-Colored Jade Pagoda, there is the Jade Heart, which has immeasurable uses..."</p><p></p><p>"What kind of uses?" Lu Changsheng took a sip of his wine.</p><p></p><p>Han Jinlong suddenly glanced at the bowed head of Zhou Dafu and said, "You should know, come, tell Fellow Daoist Lu."</p><p></p><p>"Yes, yes, yes..." Zhou Dafu raised his head, looking at Lu Changsheng with reverence, then lowered his head again and respectfully said:</p><p></p><p>"Senior, the Jade Heart is rightfully considered a supreme treasure. Its most important function is that it can greatly increase the possibility of late-stage Divine Dao cultivators breaking through to the Divine Profound Realm!"</p><p></p><p>Han Jinlong nodded slightly. Indeed, when it came to this, the preciousness of the Jade Heart was self-evident.</p><p></p><p>The Divine Profound Realm was the core combat power in the Divine-Demonic Battlefield, and was so for any tribe.</p><p></p><p>Moreover, the Jade Heart had an even more important function for the current situation of the Human Tribe, aside from helping Divine Dao cultivators break through to the Divine Profound Realm!</p><p></p><p>Lu Changsheng nodded to indicate he understood, then looked at Han Jinlong with a half-smile and said:</p><p></p><p>"So you're telling me about this Seven-Colored Jade Pagoda... for what purpose?"</p><p></p><p>Han Jinlong coughed dryly, feeling gloomy in his heart. He had a strange feeling that somehow this young friend Lu seemed to know his thoughts.</p><p></p><p>He then picked up his folding fan, snapped it open, and said while fanning himself, "Fellow Daoist Lu, you don't know, but I accidentally obtained news that the Seven-Colored Jade Pagoda is about to open soon."</p><p></p><p>Zhou Dafu's pupils suddenly shrank. The Seven-Colored Jade Pagoda was about to open? </p><p></p><p>At that time, there would be another fierce battle among the tribes!</p><p></p><p>Seeing that Lu Changsheng did not seem inclined to speak, Han Jinlong smiled and said, "Fellow Daoist Lu, I observe that your strength is not bad. Do you have any interest in participating in the Seven-Colored Jade Pagoda?"</p><p></p><p>He couldn't help but have a vague feeling that if this young friend Lu were to participate in the Seven-Colored Jade Pagoda, there might be some surprises.</p><p></p><p>"What? Whether I can participate in the Seven-Colored Jade Pagoda is not something you can decide, is it? I've just arrived at the Divine-Demonic Battlefield and heard that the Human Tribe has five Overlords. Are you one of them?" Lu Changsheng said leisurely.</p><p></p><p>"I... of course I'm not. If I were an Overlord, how could I be here discussing this with you? But Fellow Daoist Lu, don't underestimate me. I can still say a few words in front of King Jinlun and Abbot Gunsheng."</p><p></p><p>Hearing this, Zhou Dafu's heart raced, and he looked at Han Jinlong with shocked sidelong glances.</p><p></p><p>Lu Changsheng shook his head, looked deeply at Han Jinlong, then grabbed the turtle shell and stood up, smiling as he said, "I do have some interest in things I haven't tried before, but... you said it's useless unless Gold Wheel King or Abbot Gunsheng come to invite me. Perhaps I might consider it then."</p>

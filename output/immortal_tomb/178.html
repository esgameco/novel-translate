        <h1>Chapter 178</h1>
        <div class="content">
            <p>Here is the full English translation of the Chinese excerpt:</p><p></p><p>It has been half a month since the Jiang clan imperial family was destroyed. üê§üçü‚ûÖ‚ûà‚ì¢–ΩœÖùìß.‚ÑÉ‚ìû‡πìüíòüíú</p><p></p><p>During this period, the news of the downfall of the Jiang clan imperial family has been spreading and fermenting wildly in the Heavenly Scar.</p><p></p><p>The Black Calamity Domain, a special domain, has become widely known in the Heavenly Scar for the time being.</p><p></p><p>The reason is none other than the fact that the Longevity Tavern is located within it.</p><p></p><p>And the owner of the Longevity Tavern is none other than the super ruthless person who exterminated the Jiang clan imperial family, Lu Changsheng.</p><p></p><p>At the same time, there is also news that the Battle clan imperial family in the Holy Immortal Realm has recently moved their entire clan overnight...</p><p></p><p>Everyone is shocked and puzzled by this, wondering if the Battle clan imperial family also has a grudge against Lu Changsheng?</p><p></p><p>It's simply terrifying to think about.</p><p></p><p>Now in the Holy Immortal Realm, with the Jiang clan imperial family destroyed and the Battle clan imperial family having migrated, only the Chen clan imperial family remains dominant...</p><p></p><p>The Holy Immortal Realm, the Chen clan imperial family.</p><p></p><p>In the Assembly Hall, the atmosphere is tense and somber.</p><p></p><p>Chen Zhennan has a grim expression, his face full of worry.</p><p></p><p>He sweeps his gaze over the silent elders. Normally, these elders, relying on their status as the upper echelons of the Chen clan imperial family, would be arrogant and overbearing in the Heavenly Scar, but today, they are like startled birds.</p><p></p><p>"The Jiang clan imperial family has been destroyed, and the Battle clan imperial family has mysteriously migrated overnight, even abandoning their roots. Now, in this Holy Immortal Realm, only our Chen clan imperial family remains... Elders, what are your thoughts?" Chen Zhennan asked solemnly.</p><p></p><p>Upon hearing this, the elders look at each other, unsure of what to say.</p><p></p><p>"Clan Leader, should we also run... migrate?" suddenly, an elder said cautiously, almost slipping up and causing himself to break out in a cold sweat.</p><p></p><p>Slap!</p><p></p><p>Chen Zhennan angrily threw a wine cup in front of him, scolding, "Migrate? What wrongdoing have we, the Chen clan imperial family, committed that we need to run... migrate?"</p><p></p><p>The group of elders are left completely flustered.</p><p></p><p>"Hmph," Chen Zhennan snorted disapprovingly at them.</p><p></p><p>At this moment, an old man appeared in the hall.</p><p></p><p>The old man is emaciated, with sunken eye sockets, and his entire body is shrouded in a deathly aura, just like Jiang Wumiao.</p><p></p><p>"Ancestor!" </p><p></p><p>Chen Zhennan and the others are startled, quickly bowing in reverence.</p><p></p><p>Chen Jiang waved his withered hand and smiled, "Rise, all of you."</p><p></p><p>Hearing this, Chen Zhennan and the elders quickly stood up, staring at Chen Jiang with unwavering eyes, ready to listen to his teachings.</p><p></p><p>"Hehe, I already know about the downfall of the Jiang clan imperial family and the flight of the Battle clan imperial family," Chen Jiang sighed contemplatively. "A hundred million years ago, I did not participate in that matter, which might be the most correct decision I've made in my life..."</p><p></p><p>Chen Zhennan and the others are slightly taken aback.</p><p></p><p>Chen Jiang continued, "Zhennan, you don't need to worry. Our Chen clan imperial family has no grudge against that senior Lu, so he will not attack us."</p><p></p><p>Hearing the Ancestor's firm assurance, the tense atmosphere in the group immediately relaxes.</p><p></p><p>"Ancestor, what was that matter? Could it be that the Battle clan imperial family was also involved, in addition to the Jiang clan imperial family?" Chen Zhennan asked.</p><p></p><p>"Correct, otherwise why would the Battle clan imperial family flee? But since that senior Lu has returned, the Battle clan imperial family will have a hard time escaping. Battle Shanhai, that old fellow, is probably going to the Extreme Desolate Forest to seek the alliance of the Beast Ancestors," Chen Jiang smiled slightly, a hint of schadenfreude in his old eyes.</p><p></p><p>Battle Shanhai?</p><p></p><p>The clan leader of the Battle clan imperial family is Battle Xingmang, so Battle Shanhai must be... !</p><p></p><p>Chen Zhennan and the elders are stunned.</p><p></p><p>"Yes, he is the ancestor of the Battle clan, and a contemporary existence with me and Jiang Wumiao. However, in terms of strength, he is a bit stronger than me and Jiang Wumiao," Chen Jiang said, slightly disgruntled.</p><p></p><p>Here is the full English translation of the Chinese excerpt:</p><p></p><p>The old man immediately let out another arrogant laugh: "He has been defiant and unruly his entire life, but he made a mistake in his decision. This time, the Shi clan and the imperial clan may decline at his hands. In comparison, my vision is much more ruthless!"</p><p></p><p>"That is certainly the case. Our Chen clan is fortunate to have our venerable ancestor." Chen Zhennan flattered him and then asked, "Venerable ancestor... what exactly was that matter...?"</p><p></p><p>The other elders also perked up their ears upon hearing this, truly curious.</p><p></p><p>Chen Jiang suddenly dropped his smile and indifferently said, "You all need not ask about such matters, for they are beyond your level of understanding."</p><p></p><p>After saying this, he disregarded the awkward crowd and turned his head to look outside the hall, his aged eyes filled with reminiscence.</p><p></p><p>At Chen Jiang's level, he naturally knew that there were countless worlds beyond the Heavenly Scar.</p><p></p><p>In the past, some mysterious and powerful experts had descended upon the Heavenly Scar and recruited a group of Immortal Ancestor realm experts, including him, Jiang Wumang, Zhan Shanhai, and the Progenitor of the Profound Abyss Beast.</p><p></p><p>And their purpose was L√º Changsheng.</p><p></p><p>Or more precisely, it was for L√º Changsheng's eternal life.</p><p></p><p>The rumor was that a single drop of his blood could prolong one's lifespan and add many more years to one's life.</p><p></p><p>As Immortal Ancestor realm experts, they had lifespans of no more than a million years, which was equivalent to the remaining five to ten years of a mortal's life.</p><p></p><p>Hearing this news, they were naturally extremely excited. Who wouldn't want to obtain more lifespan? Who wouldn't want to live on?</p><p></p><p>However, the situation was full of uncertainties, and they were also filled with wariness and distrust towards those mysterious experts.</p><p></p><p>So in the end, only Jiang Wumang, Zhan Shanhai, and the Progenitor of the Profound Abyss Beast participated. They were not the type to be content with the status quo, so they naturally would not miss such an opportunity for a gamble.</p><p></p><p>Initially, those mysterious experts were furious to see that only Jiang Wumang's trio from the Heavenly Scar had participated, and they even threatened to attack the other Immortal Ancestor realm experts!</p><p></p><p>Fortunately, at a critical moment, the Heavenly Dao of the Heavenly Scar intervened and expelled those mysterious experts from the Heavenly Scar.</p><p></p><p>But it was only an expulsion, as the Heavenly Dao seemed to have little power over those mysterious experts.</p><p></p><p>Later on...</p><p></p><p>Chen Jiang heard from Jiang Wumang that their operation had failed, and he still remembered Jiang Wumang's shock and helplessness when he mentioned L√º Changsheng.</p><p></p><p>Jiang Wumang said that L√º Changsheng was a monster.</p><p></p><p>Even with their combined efforts in unleashing the ultimate techniques, they were unable to break through his defenses!</p><p></p><p>Not to mention seizing the eternal life, they couldn't even obtain a drop of his blood!</p><p></p><p>In the end, as a precaution, they could only reluctantly suppress him and confine him in a relatively hidden small world.</p><p></p><p>Until now... L√º Changsheng has broken free from the seal, and who can do anything to him?</p><p></p><p>In the past, so many top-tier experts were powerless against him, let alone Jiang Wumang's group now?</p><p></p><p>Compared to those mysterious experts, Jiang Wumang's group is likely much weaker.</p><p></p><p>Fortunately, a hundred thousand years ago, Chen Jiang did not act recklessly.</p><p></p><p>Otherwise, he would have brought about the destruction of the Chen clan, and Chen Jiang felt that he would have let down the ancestors of the Chen Imperial Clan.</p><p></p><p>"Zhennan."</p><p></p><p>Chen Jiang suddenly turned his aged gaze towards Chen Zhennan.</p><p></p><p>"Venerable ancestor, please speak," Chen Zhennan immediately bowed even lower.</p><p></p><p>"Although that individual will not attack our Chen Imperial Clan, we must still fulfill our obligations in terms of human relations!" Chen Jiang said solemnly, and with a wave of his hand, he commanded, "Prepare the most generous gifts, and you will all accompany me to the Black Calamity Domain to pay our respects to Senior L√º!"</p><p></p><p>"Yes." The crowd responded with a shudder and bowed in acknowledgment.</p>

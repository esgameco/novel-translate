        <div class="content">
            <p>Here is the full English translation of the Chinese excerpt:</p><p></p><p>When Cold Qing asked this question, the others also turned to look at Lu Changsheng. </p><p></p><p>Yes, this was a question that many of them had long wanted to ask. This Extreme Desolate Forest was so dangerous, and it was not common to see someone venture in alone.</p><p></p><p>Lu Changsheng looked straight ahead and said directly, "I came here to find the Battle Imperial Clan."</p><p></p><p>As soon as the words fell, the crowd was shaken, exchanging glances with one another.</p><p></p><p>For a moment, the only sound in the camp was the crackle of the campfire...</p><p></p><p>Could it be... </p><p></p><p>"Fellow Daoist, could it be that you are a scion of the Battle Imperial Clan?" </p><p></p><p>Cold Qing's voice had even changed a bit, and the gaze he looked at Lu Changsheng with unconsciously carried a hint of reverence.</p><p></p><p>Xiao Yan and Zhang Sheng, as well as the other disciples, also had slightly stiff expressions on their faces.</p><p></p><p>If he truly was a scion of the Battle Imperial Clan, his status would be far higher than these sect disciples.</p><p></p><p>They would have to treat him well, lest they offend him and bring the wrath of the Battle Imperial Clan down upon them - their three sects would then be finished.</p><p></p><p>Lu Changsheng paused for a moment, then shook his head with a wry smile, not saying anything further.</p><p></p><p>But this gesture of his, in the eyes of Xiao Yan and Cold Qing, was tacit acknowledgement!</p><p></p><p>Instantly, the originally displeased disciples of the Heavenly Dragon Sect tried their best to correct their attitude - they dared not offend the scion of the Battle Imperial Clan.</p><p></p><p>At this time, Cold Qing and Zhang Sheng's eyes flickered, and a fawning intention arose in their hearts.</p><p></p><p>If they could befriend the scion of the Battle Imperial Clan, wouldn't they be able to walk with their heads held high in the future? If they got close, wouldn't it even bring opportunities for their sects to flourish?</p><p></p><p>Quickly, the two of them gathered around, drawing a little closer to Lu Changsheng.</p><p></p><p>Zhang Sheng, with a hint of subtle flattery, cupped his hands and smiled, "Fellow Daoist Battle, in the Heavenly Scar Sacred Immortal Realm, there are three great imperial clans - the Battle, Jiang, and Chen clans. Among them, I have always admired the Battle Imperial Clan the most!"</p><p></p><p>Seeing this, Cold Qing did not want to fall behind, hastily raising his hand and saying, "Me too, me too. In the past, I've heard my master say that among the three great imperial clans, the Battle Imperial Clan is the foremost. Fellow Daoist Battle, you may not know, but my master always speaks of the Battle Imperial Clan with the utmost reverence!"</p><p></p><p>The two of them successively flattered and fawned, directly addressing Lu Changsheng as "Fellow Daoist Battle", since in the Heavenly Scar, everyone knew that the imperial clan members all shared the same surname.</p><p></p><p>The other disciples sat silently to the side, watching this scene.</p><p></p><p>It was the disciples of the Heavenly Dragon Sect who were a bit anxious. They looked at Xiao Yan countless times, and some even sent him a voice transmission.</p><p></p><p>"Big Martial Brother, the Three Pure Palace and the Scorching Sun Valley are trying to get close to the Battle Imperial Clan. Aren't you going to do anything? If they manage to get close to the Battle Imperial Clan, in the future, we of the Heavenly Dragon Sect may have to watch their every move."</p><p></p><p>"Big Martial Brother..."</p><p></p><p>Hearing the voice transmissions from his junior martial brothers, Xiao Yan frowned slightly, feeling a bit displeased.</p><p></p><p>He, Xiao Yan, was not the type to flatter and fawn!</p><p></p><p>...</p><p></p><p>"Fellow Daoist Battle, I am Xiao Yan of the Heavenly Dragon Sect. To be able to encounter a noble scion of the imperial clan like you today is truly a rare blessing."</p><p></p><p>Xiao Yan came over and cupped his hands, smiling.</p><p></p><p>Zhang Sheng and Cold Qing raised their eyebrows, somewhat surprised.</p><p></p><p>They didn't expect the usually aloof and high-minded Xiao Yan to also come try to establish a relationship.</p><p></p><p>Lu Changsheng couldn't be bothered to pay attention to them, closing his eyes and leaning against the big tree to rest.</p><p></p><p>The three of them saw Lu Changsheng ignoring them, feeling a bit displeased.</p><p></p><p>But thinking of his status as a scion of the Battle Imperial Clan, they didn't dare to show it. They exchanged a glance and then withdrew.</p><p></p><p>Inwardly sighing, they thought: The Battle Imperial Clan is indeed the Battle Imperial Clan, lofty and proud. It seems they look down on us sect disciples from the bottom of their hearts.</p><p></p><p>The night passed without further incident.</p><p></p><p>...</p><p></p><p>The next day.</p><p></p><p>Lu Changsheng and the three sect disciples continued to walk towards the outer edge of the Extreme Desolate Forest.</p><p></p><p>The disciples were leaping among the tree branches like fleas, their movements quite agile, showing that they were eager to catch up with their elders.</p><p></p><p>As for Lu Changsheng, he was hanging at the back of the group, not hurrying or slowing down, his every step taking him dozens of meters away.</p><p></p><p>After a night of interaction, the disciples had learned quite a bit about this "scion of the Battle Imperial Clan".</p><p></p><p>They all felt that he was either proud and aloof, or had an introverted personality, seemingly disdaining or not caring to associate with them, mere sect disciples.</p><p></p><p>Here is the full English translation of the Chinese excerpt:</p><p></p><p>Making Friends.</p><p></p><p>New 69 Book Bar ‚Üí 69shuùíô.ùíÑùíêùíé</p><p></p><p>After all, the other party cherishes words like gold, and they haven't even said a few sentences in total.</p><p></p><p>Next,</p><p></p><p>it will be resting at night and traveling during the day.</p><p></p><p>Finally, after three days, the group of disciples rushed to the outskirts of the extremely dense forest.</p><p></p><p>Elder Jin Hua and the others immediately sensed the return of the three sect disciples, their eyes all lighting up, and they quickly flashed towards that direction.</p><p></p><p>After about half an incense stick's worth of time,</p><p></p><p>"Xiao Yan!"</p><p></p><p>"Zhang Sheng!"</p><p></p><p>"Leng Qing!"</p><p></p><p>The elders saw their sect's disciples from afar and called out with a smile.</p><p></p><p>At the same time, they heaved a huge sigh of relief in their hearts!</p><p></p><p>It's good that they're alive, the disciples' luck seems to be not bad, they haven't encountered the Battle Clan Imperial Clan and that Senior Lu.</p><p></p><p>A few days ago, the shocking sword cry that resounded from the depths of the extremely dense forest, they had naturally heard it as well.</p><p></p><p>It must be that the Battle Clan Imperial Clan and that Senior Lu have started fighting!</p><p></p><p>At the time, they were all terrified, even suspecting that their own disciples had been wiped out in the aftermath of that terrifying battle.</p><p></p><p>It's just that they also had a puzzling point, which was that the sword cry only lasted for a while and then disappeared...</p><p></p><p>Could it be that Senior Lu and the Battle Clan Imperial Clan only had a brief clash?</p><p></p><p>"Elders!!"</p><p></p><p>Xiao Yan and the other disciples were also pleasantly surprised, heaving a heavy sigh of relief in their hearts, seeing their own elders was like returning to the embrace of their parents, the long-lost sense of security finally returned.</p><p></p><p>Soon, Elder Jin Hua and the others appeared before the disciples, scanning them with satisfaction.</p><p></p><p>"You little rascals, you really have good luck. Nowadays, this extremely dense forest is much more dangerous than before..."</p><p></p><p>Jin Hua scanned the disciples with a sigh, then smiled and said, "But it's good that you've returned safely."</p><p></p><p>Hearing this, the other elders also solemnly nodded.</p><p></p><p>It's good that they've returned, at this point, whether they've been tempered or not, the points don't matter anymore.</p><p></p><p>Xiao Yan's eyes flashed as he looked at Jin Hua and said, "Elder, when you said it's much more dangerous, are you referring to the matter of the Battle Clan Imperial Clan and a certain Senior Lu?"</p><p></p><p>Hearing this, Elder Jin Hua and the others were not surprised, after all, the two sentences that had resounded through the extremely dense forest a few days ago were already very clear.</p><p></p><p>Only an idiot wouldn't be able to hear it.</p><p></p><p>"That's right." Jin Hua nodded, "The grudge between the Battle Clan Imperial Clan and that Senior Lu is not something we small fry can interfere with, especially that Senior Lu... you don't know..."</p><p></p><p>Thereupon, Jin Hua proceeded to tell the disciples about the shocking events that had occurred in the outside world recently, and the disciples listened with their mouths agape, their minds shaken!</p><p></p><p>That Lu Changsheng, he had actually destroyed an imperial clan in the recent period!</p><p></p><p>And now he is the number one figure above the imperial clans!</p><p></p><p>Jin Hua was secretly satisfied when he saw this, he just wanted the disciples to know the seriousness of the situation.</p><p></p><p>And to know that there are heavens beyond heavens, and people beyond people!</p><p></p><p>Thinking of the Battle Clan, the disciples suddenly thought of Lu Changsheng!</p><p></p><p>"Oh yes, Elder, we... we encountered a scion of the Battle Clan Imperial Clan inside. He came out with us, he's been hanging at the back of the group, he should be arriving soon."</p><p></p><p>At this moment, Leng Qing suddenly said in a solemn voice.</p><p></p><p>What? A scion of the Battle Clan Imperial Clan?!</p><p></p><p>Elder Jin Hua and the others looked at each other, all seeing the shock in each other's eyes.</p><p></p><p>Tap, tap, tap...</p><p></p><p>Just then, Lu Changsheng, who had been hanging at the back, finally arrived.</p><p></p><p>Immediately, the gazes of Elder Jin Hua and the others all focused intently on Lu Changsheng.</p><p></p><p>Jin Hua took a light breath, not relying on his status as an elder, and quickly walked over, cupping his hands and smiling respectfully, "I am Jin Hua of the Tianlong Sect, pleased to meet you, Fellow Daoist Battle."</p><p></p><p>The other elders also stepped forward one by one, introducing themselves and cupping their hands in greeting.</p><p></p><p>Even though the person in front of them was just a scion of the Battle Clan Imperial Clan, they could not afford to be disrespectful.</p><p></p><p>Xiao Yan, Leng Qing and the other disciples saw this scene and couldn't help but take a deep breath, only then realizing that they had greatly underestimated the status of the Battle Clan Imperial Clan's scion, even their own elders were so polite in their treatment.</p><p></p><p>"Battle?" Lu Changsheng looked at Jin Hua, puzzled, "My surname is... Lu."</p><p></p><p>Jin Hua: "......"</p><p></p><p>Everyone: "......"</p>

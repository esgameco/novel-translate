        <h1>Chapter 399</h1>
        <div class="content">
            <p>Here is the full English translation of the Chinese excerpt:</p><p></p><p>Shenlo sensed the blood trickling from his neck, and a chill of panic finally arose in his heart.</p><p></p><p>He never imagined that he would be this close to death one day.</p><p></p><p>He also finally realized that the human race, under the immense pressure from his father, in their emotional excitement, would not hesitate to kill him.</p><p></p><p>Thinking of this, Shenlo started to shiver a little. As a noble figure, he naturally did not want to die like this, so he looked at Shenying with a pleading gaze: "Fa-Father."</p><p></p><p>Shenying looked at Jianwuhuai indifferently, "Do you know what the Godly Realm is? Playing such tricks in the face of my Godly Realm... Jianwuhuai, you are still too green!"</p><p></p><p>Jianwuhuai was startled, and instinctively swung his sword to kill Shenlo, but at that moment, his sword seemed to be mysteriously obstructed for a moment!</p><p></p><p>In that instant, Shenlo's figure seemed to be empowered by a mysterious force, and he suddenly flashed and appeared in front of the gods and goddesses of the Shenyue clan.</p><p></p><p>"Divine Son!"</p><p></p><p>Shenyue, Shengxing, and others quickly gathered around and untied Shenlo.</p><p></p><p>All the tribes were shocked by this. What just happened? How did the Divine Son Shenlo suddenly return to the camp of the gods and goddesses?</p><p></p><p>Inevitably, everyone looked at the expressionless Shenying, their hearts filled with fear!</p><p></p><p>It must be the doing of the Godly Realm Sovereign!</p><p></p><p>To casually rescue a person from Jianwuhuai's sword... truly the power of the Godly Realm!</p><p></p><p>"Hehe, you think you can kill my Divine Son, Jianwuhuai? You're not even worthy!" Shenlo shouted at Jianwuhuai from afar after being rescued.</p><p></p><p>The human race camp, Jianwuhuai and others had an extremely unsightly expression, and some even turned deathly pale!</p><p></p><p>No one had expected the Godly Realm to be so mysterious...</p><p></p><p>At this moment, they had lost the important hostage Shenlo, and the bloody scene of the Tianya clan was still vivid in their minds...</p><p></p><p>Shenying could instantly kill peak-level clan leaders, so killing them, the human race, would be like slaughtering chickens and dogs.</p><p></p><p>"Sword Venerable, what... what should we do?" Mantian said with great difficulty.</p><p></p><p>Shenlo was rescued so easily, who could have imagined this?</p><p></p><p>"Hehe, now, what else do you have to rely on?" Shenying looked at the human race crowd, not rushing to attack, but with a mocking and playful expression on his face.</p><p></p><p>At the same time, in the depths of his eyes, there was a hint of disdain and coldness.</p><p></p><p>The human race was the tribe he hated the most!</p><p></p><p>A small tribe, how could their form be so similar to that of the god clan?</p><p></p><p>Especially when many powerful cultivators of the various tribes transformed, they were all called human form!</p><p></p><p>Why should it be the human form? It should be the form of their god clan.</p><p></p><p>Their god clan was the number one of all tribes!</p><p></p><p>At this moment, except for the mocking god clan crowd, whether it was the great clan leaders like Biyou on the stone pillars, or the cultivators of the various tribes, they all looked at the human race crowd with pity.</p><p></p><p>The human race would eventually follow in the footsteps of the Tianya clan, and the Godly Realm Sovereign would not let the human race go.</p><p></p><p>Everyone could see that the Godly Realm Sovereign was just torturing the mentality of the human race crowd at the moment.</p><p></p><p>"Ah, it's a pity for the human race. To be honest, I don't really want the human race in the Divine-Demon Battlefield to be wiped out. Without the human race, the Divine-Demon Battlefield will lose a lot of interest."</p><p></p><p>"Yes, but the human race is like a race full of miracles. In memory, it seems that every time they were in dire straits, they were able to turn danger into safety..."</p><p></p><p>"Hehe, that was in the past. This time, facing the Godly Realm Sovereign, the human race will not be able to turn danger into safety again."</p><p></p><p>"Isn't the human race's Azure Robe Sword Immortal not here? I think he might be planning to escape the Divine-Demon Battlefield for future revenge."</p><p></p><p>"Very likely."</p><p></p><p>"..."</p><p></p><p>Here is the full English translation of the Chinese excerpt:</p><p></p><p>As the cultivators of the various clans discussed in secret,</p><p></p><p>In the human faction, Jian Wuhui's gaze became resolute as he transmitted a message:</p><p></p><p>"Barbarian King, Cudgel Saint, Wind Venerable, Golden Wheel King."</p><p></p><p>The four human lords, Jiang Wuxin, were startled, looking at Jian Wuhui's back, not understanding what he meant.</p><p></p><p>Jian Wuhui tightened his grip on the sword in his hand, closed his eyes, and said, "Shen Luo was just rescued, and none of us expected it... Now, we definitely can't win in a fight. I want to try to help you delay Shen Ting for a moment, and you take the opportunity to escape with Fang Yun and the others."</p><p></p><p>Upon hearing this, the four were taken aback, wanting to say something,</p><p></p><p>But Jian Wuhui fiercely stabbed his long sword into the ground in front of him, shouting, "Go!!!"</p><p></p><p>Boom!!!</p><p></p><p>Fierce sword qi erupted!</p><p></p><p>Instantly, all the human faction members, along with the captives of the major clans, were blasted back!</p><p></p><p>"Sword Venerable!!"</p><p>"Lord Sword Venerable!!"</p><p></p><p>The expressions of the human faction members changed drastically, and everyone understood what Jian Wuhui was trying to do!</p><p></p><p>Oh??</p><p>Shen Ting's gaze narrowed slightly.</p><p></p><p>"Jiang Wuxin, take them and leave!!"</p><p></p><p>After Jian Wuhui's furious roar, he forcefully pressed his palm down on the long sword, causing it to tremble violently, along with the entire surrounding area and space.</p><p></p><p>"Sword Guard Technique, Horizontal Sword Domain!!"</p><p></p><p>Jiang Wuxin and the others had red eyes, but reluctantly led the group away in the distance.</p><p></p><p>.........</p><p></p><p>Swoosh swoosh swoosh—</p><p>Sword qi swept across the area, blasting away countless cultivators of the various clans.</p><p></p><p>Everyone was shocked, staring at the central figure, Jian Wuhui.</p><p></p><p>Even Bi You and Ao Zhengtian on the stone pillars had their expressions change,</p><p>How could Jian Wuhui's strength be so powerful?</p><p>With such strength, how could he only rank fifth from the bottom in the individual combat power ranking?</p><p></p><p>Hum hum hum!</p><p>After a series of rapid fluctuations, the area around Jian Wuhui had turned into a vacuum.</p><p>The golden sword qi moved in an orderly manner, forming a sword domain without any dead angles.</p><p></p><p>"Trying to stop a car with your bare arms!"</p><p>Shen Ting's eyes narrowed slightly as he said indifferently.</p><p>Then, he suddenly raised his hand and lightly pointed forward.</p><p></p><p>Crack crack crack crack!</p><p>Jian Wuhui's thick Horizontal Sword Domain began to shatter from the top.</p><p></p><p>"Bang—"</p><p>In the next moment, the Horizontal Sword Domain was completely destroyed.</p><p></p><p>Jian Wuhui's face turned deathly pale, and he violently coughed up a mouthful of fresh blood, staggering back a few steps and leaning on his sword for support.</p><p>Jian Wuhui looked up with difficulty at the Shen Ting in front of him, a faint smile appearing on his pale face: "No wonder you are at the Divine Realm level..."</p><p></p><p>......</p><p></p><p>At the same time, the red-robed Hongyan, who had fled with the human faction, suddenly coughed up a mouthful of blood and became weak, almost falling from the sky.</p><p></p><p>"Hong... Hongyan!"</p><p>Jiang Wuxin and the others were startled, their faces full of doubt and confusion. They hurriedly went forward to support her.</p><p></p><p>The old turtle nearby was silent, as if he had seen something.</p><p>Seeing the puzzled expressions of the others, Hongyan fell silent for a moment, her pale face filled with grief as she said, "I have a contract with my master, we share life and death... My master's situation is now very dire..."</p><p></p><p>What?!</p><p>Jiang Wuxin and the others' eyes turned red, their bodies seemingly crawling with ants. Although they had already anticipated that Jian Wuhui's ending would not be good, but now...</p><p></p><p>Suddenly, Hongyan was struck again, her whole body convulsing as if she had been electrocuted, and then she fainted.</p><p></p><p>This indicated that Jian Wuhui's condition was also extremely difficult, and he might even die soon.</p><p></p><p>.........</p><p></p><p>For the fastest updates on this novel, please visit www.feixs.com</p><p>For mobile access, go to https://m.feixs.com/chapter-45751-38225518</p>

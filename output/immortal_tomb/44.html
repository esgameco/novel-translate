        <h1>Chapter 44</h1>
        <div class="content">
            <p>Here is the full English translation of the Chinese excerpt:</p><p></p><p>Night. ‚ñë‚ñí‚ñì‚ñà ‚ùªÔºôÔΩì—í‡∏¢‚ìß.ùî†ùìûÔΩç ‚ñà‚ñì‚ñí‚ñë</p><p></p><p>The Immortal Tomb in the Mountain Range.</p><p></p><p>"I was buried here before," Lu Changsheng said calmly, standing in the middle of the tomb group at the spot where he had been buried previously, his hands behind his back.</p><p></p><p>On his shoulder, the old turtle looked at him quite mysteriously and curiously asked, "Master, where is your tomb?"</p><p></p><p>"I erased it," Lu Changsheng replied.</p><p></p><p>The old turtle nodded its head and scanned the other tombs, "There are no epitaphs on any of these tombs."</p><p></p><p>"Mm-hmm."</p><p></p><p>"Master, aren't you curious? Shall we dig up these tombs and take a look?" the old turtle said, quite intrigued.</p><p></p><p>After countless years, the old turtle's state of mind was no longer easily stirred by things.</p><p></p><p>But this matter had aroused its great interest and curiosity.</p><p></p><p>To be able to bury Lu Changsheng for over a million years, that was impressive.</p><p></p><p>Lu Changsheng did not speak, his gaze flickering slightly.</p><p></p><p>At this moment, a burly man with a full beard suddenly appeared in the cemetery.</p><p></p><p>"I just can't believe it, a tomb in the Immortal Tomb actually disappeared into thin air!" </p><p></p><p>Tiger Battle cursed and grumbled, and just as he was about to take a step, he paused in mid-air, not coming down.</p><p></p><p>He saw a young man in blue robes standing quietly in the tomb, looking at him like a ghost.</p><p></p><p>A cultivator?</p><p></p><p>Tiger Battle's eyes flashed, and he immediately tried to probe the other's aura...</p><p></p><p>But he was shocked,</p><p></p><p>Impossible, as a mighty demonic lord, how could he not be able to discern the realm of a human cultivator?</p><p></p><p>In the Spiritual Dust Immortal Realm, aside from Zhang Youdao, Qin Fuming, and Jiang Yuan, the few who had reached the Tribulation Crossing realm, who else was there?</p><p></p><p>This person must have some treasure that conceals his aura...</p><p></p><p>Tiger Battle was somewhat puzzled for the moment, deciding not to bother this young cultivator in blue, and instead started to carefully observe the tombs one by one as he walked around.</p><p></p><p>"Master, this little demon's true form is actually the Roaring Heavenly Tiger, I didn't expect there to be one in this realm," the old turtle chuckled.</p><p></p><p>The Roaring Heavenly Tiger clan was quite famous in the various immortal realms.</p><p></p><p>However, of course, the one in front of them was too weak, any Roaring Heavenly Tiger from the immortal realms could easily crush him.</p><p></p><p>Lu Changsheng nodded slightly, not saying anything.</p><p></p><p>With his Great Dao Eyes, what couldn't he see?</p><p></p><p>He even knew that this tiger demon was the lord of the Demon Realm.</p><p></p><p>But since it had no connection with him at the moment, he naturally wouldn't destroy it for no reason.</p><p></p><p>All lives, whether human or various demonic beings, were more or less the same in his eyes.</p><p></p><p>However, at times, he couldn't help but lean a bit more towards the human race, after all, he was human himself, wasn't he?... Actually, Lu Changsheng wasn't entirely sure.</p><p></p><p>Tiger Battle strolled slowly, looking at one tomb after another, and soon came to stand in front of Lu Changsheng, his towering figure a full head taller than Lu Changsheng.</p><p></p><p>He inexplicably glanced at Lu Changsheng, then turned his gaze to the spot in front of Lu Changsheng, his expression immediately changing!</p><p></p><p>Sure enough, a tomb had disappeared!</p><p></p><p>In his memory, there had definitely been a tomb here!</p><p></p><p>But now it was empty, extremely strange!</p><p></p><p>"Hey, I suspect you also come here often, do you know there was a tomb here before?" Tiger Battle couldn't help but point to that spot and ask Lu Changsheng.</p><p></p><p>"I'm not 'hey'," Lu Changsheng said with interest.</p><p></p><p>Tiger Battle's face darkened, and he suppressed his temper and said, "Fellow Daoist, do you know there was a tomb here before?"</p><p></p><p>Lu Changsheng said softly, "Could it be that you misremembered?"</p><p></p><p>"Impossible!!"</p><p></p><p>Here is the full English translation of the Chinese excerpt:</p><p></p><p>Tiger Battle suddenly waved his hand and said anxiously, "How could it be that only I looked wrong? My... I have a good friend who also said the same, could it be that she looked wrong too?"</p><p></p><p>Lu Changsheng smiled and said, "Actually, I've always been curious, haven't you counted the number of immortal tombs here before? If you count them once, wouldn't you understand?"</p><p></p><p>Tiger Battle glanced at Lu Changsheng, "Fellow Daoist, do you think we are all idiots? Didn't we think of such a simple method?"</p><p></p><p>He then continued, "Don't look at the immortal tombs, they may seem small, but there seems to be some mystery within. Over the long years, no one has been able to clearly count the number of them, and no one has been able to destroy even a single immortal tomb."</p><p></p><p>He then looked at Lu Changsheng the way one would look at a country bumpkin.</p><p></p><p>The meaning was unspoken: You still have too little experience!</p><p></p><p>This gaze almost made the old turtle laugh, the master has little experience?</p><p></p><p>"I see." Lu Changsheng nodded slightly.</p><p></p><p>"So I was just asking you to confirm it again." Tiger Battle said helplessly.</p><p></p><p>"Sometimes, when you already have the answer in your heart, there's no need to confirm it again." Lu Changsheng said indifferently.</p><p></p><p>"Alright then." Tiger Battle's eyes flashed, in fact he didn't quite understand the meaning of the man in the blue robe, then he laughed and said, "I'm called Tiger Battle, I don't know what your honorable name is?"</p><p></p><p>"Lu Changsheng."</p><p></p><p>"Lu Changsheng?"</p><p></p><p>Tiger Battle probed, "I don't think I've heard of your name in the immortal cultivation world before."</p><p></p><p>"Is that so?" Lu Changsheng smiled mysteriously, "But I haven't heard of you in the immortal cultivation world either, Tiger Fellow Daoist. Could it be that you have been in seclusion before? Or... are you not from this world?"</p><p></p><p>Tiger Battle was greatly shocked, and hurriedly said, "In seclusion, in seclusion, of course I was in seclusion! How could I not be a person of the Spiritual Dust Realm?"</p><p></p><p>"Oh." Lu Changsheng said indifferently, "Since Tiger Fellow Daoist has been in seclusion, it's normal that I haven't heard of you. Tiger Fellow Daoist, you wouldn't be trying to deceive me, would you?"</p><p></p><p>"Haha haha..." Tiger Battle forced a smile.</p><p></p><p>In fact, his inner anger was starting to spread. What an impolite cultivator!</p><p></p><p>"Angry? Do you want to attack Lu?" </p><p></p><p>Lu Changsheng turned to look at Tiger Battle, his voice soft.</p><p></p><p>Tiger Battle was about to say something, but out of the corner of his eye, he accidentally glanced at Lu Changsheng's shoulder, and then he saw a mini turtle looking at him...</p><p></p><p>For some reason, Tiger Battle shuddered all over!</p><p></p><p>"Cough cough, Fellow Daoist is joking, we cultivators have it hard, we should cherish each other, how can we attack each other for no reason? Haha."</p><p></p><p>Tiger Battle laughed awkwardly, looked at the disappeared tomb site, and then looked deeply at Lu Changsheng and the old turtle before disappearing from the tomb site.</p><p></p><p>"Master, this Howling Demon Tiger has become a coward." The old turtle laughed.</p><p></p><p>Lu Changsheng shook his head and suddenly asked while sweeping his gaze over the tombs, "How are the other Immortal Emperors of the Four Directions Immortal Realm doing?"</p><p></p><p>The old turtle was silent for a moment and said, "They are still fine for now, it's just that the Four Directions Immortal Realm... Master, you should go back and take a look yourself sometime."</p><p></p><p>"Mm, I will..." Lu Changsheng's eyes flashed at the words, and he continued to scan the tombs, "I might have figured it out."</p><p></p><p>"Huh, Master, what have you figured out?" The old turtle's turtle face was full of confusion.</p><p></p><p>"Nothing, let's go." The figure in the blue robe slowly disappeared.</p><p></p><p>"Huh, Master, aren't you going to open the immortal tombs and take a look with old turtle?" </p><p></p><p>"I said I'm not looking, in fact... there's nothing worth looking at."</p><p></p><p>"But old turtle is a bit curious..."</p><p></p><p>"If you don't believe me, do you want me to smash your shell?"</p><p></p><p>"......"</p>

        <h1>Chapter 208</h1>
        <div class="content">
            <p>Here is the full English translation of the Chinese excerpt:</p><p></p><p>Fu Mingyan furrowed his brows, not quite understanding Peng Fang's meaning. ‡∂èüçßÔºñÔºô≈û–ΩÔºµùïè.Âåö„Ññùìú‚ò∫üëÆ</p><p></p><p>So he cupped his hands and asked, "Patriarch Xiaoyao, what do you mean by this?"</p><p></p><p>The Xiaoyao Sect members: "......"</p><p></p><p>Peng Fang's expression changed, and he could feel the strange gazes of the Xiaoyao Sect's elder disciples behind him. His heart was no longer calm, and he hastily cleared his throat, "Don't speak nonsense, I am the Grand Elder of the Xiaoyao Sect, the Patriarch is not here."</p><p></p><p>Fu Mingyan: "......"</p><p></p><p>The four of Lei Yu: "......"</p><p></p><p>The entire venue fell silent again, filled with disbelief.</p><p></p><p>Through the shock of the Xiaoyao Sect's elder who was at the bottom, they knew without a doubt how powerful the leading fat man was.</p><p></p><p>Even more terrifying was that he was not the Patriarch?</p><p></p><p>Then who was the Patriarch of the Xiaoyao Sect? And how powerful was he?</p><p></p><p>The thoughts of the crowd instantly turned to the mysterious Xiaoyao Sect Patriarch.</p><p></p><p>Fu Mingyan regained his composure and continued the previous topic, looking at Peng Fang, "Then what does the Grand Elder of the Xiaoyao Sect mean?"</p><p></p><p>Peng Fang's eyes flashed as he said, "This Elder wants to say, is there no rank restriction for cross-level challenges?"</p><p></p><p>Fu Mingyan paused, then solemnly said, "Except for only being able to cross-level within your own domain, there are no other restrictions for now."</p><p></p><p>In the past Grand Competitions, there had never been any restrictions on cross-leveling.</p><p></p><p>Why? Because all along, even if there were sects daring to cross-level, they would only cross one level, or even two levels, which was rare.</p><p></p><p>So in the eyes of the top-tier sects, setting restrictions was unnecessary!</p><p></p><p>Hearing this, a smile appeared on Peng Fang's face as he looked at Fu Mingyan and asked again, "Then tell me, among the three Grade-One sects in this Human Realm, which one is the strongest?"</p><p></p><p>As soon as these words fell, the eyes of the four of Lei Yu suddenly sharpened!!</p><p></p><p>And the sects present also had their pupils contract into needle-like shapes!!</p><p></p><p>The implied meaning of the Xiaoyao Sect, they seemed to have vaguely guessed some of it...</p><p></p><p>Could it be...?</p><p></p><p>Fu Mingyan's throat moved, and he asked solemnly, "What do you mean?"</p><p></p><p>Peng Fang smiled lightly, "Nothing, I'm just asking."</p><p></p><p>Fu Mingyan glanced at the four of Lei Yu out of the corner of his eye, then solemnly said, "Among the Grade-One sects in the Human Realm, the strongest is the Great Day Thunder Sect."</p><p></p><p>"Haha, good!" </p><p></p><p>Peng Fang suddenly laughed towards the sky, then abruptly turned around, his gaze sweeping across the many elders, stewards, and disciples of the Xiaoyao Sect.</p><p></p><p>Their eyes were filled with excited anticipation, their blood boiling!</p><p></p><p>They understood the meaning of the Grand Elder!!</p><p></p><p>In the next instant,</p><p></p><p>Peng Fang suddenly injected a wisp of immortal essence into the jade token, and then, under the astonished gaze of everyone, he threw the glowing jade token into the sky!!</p><p></p><p>At the same time, he shouted in a low voice,</p><p></p><p>"The Xiaoyao Sect challenges the cross-level battle! The cross-level sect - the Great Day Thunder Sect!!!"</p><p></p><p>.........</p><p></p><p>The nine special jade tokens awarded to the champions of the Grand Competition of the Ten Thousand Sects were all forged by the strongest top-tier experts of the Linlang Heavens.</p><p></p><p>As long as a cross-level challenge is triggered, it will be reported across the various realms according to the level of the challenge.</p><p></p><p>A Grade-Nine sect challenging a Grade-One sect...</p><p></p><p>This unimaginable cross-level challenge can be said to attract the attention of both the regional and celestial realms in the coming period!!</p><p></p><p>At the same moment, the sky of the Human Realm shone with a golden glow!</p><p></p><p>Instantly attracting the attention of countless people!</p><p></p><p>"Sss! This, this is a cross-level challenge?! Such a grand phenomenon has never occurred before, what level of cross-level is this???"</p><p></p><p>"I don't know... I only know that it's going to be thoroughly exciting!"</p><p></p><p>"......"</p><p></p><p>As countless people were discussing excitedly,</p><p></p><p>Above the skies of the Human Realm,</p><p></p><p>Here is the full English translation of the Chinese excerpt:</p><p></p><p>A line of sharp, golden characters appeared!</p><p></p><p>New 69 Book Bar 99shux.com</p><p></p><p>Accompanied by the indifferent and aged voice:</p><p></p><p>"The nine-ranked sect Xiaoyao Sect will challenge the top-ranked sect Great Sun Thunder Sect in three months, a battle beyond their level... Begin!!"</p><p></p><p>As the words faded, the world fell silent.</p><p></p><p>But the silence was fleeting, as the next moment, everyone went into a frenzy!</p><p></p><p>Ah!!! </p><p></p><p>A nine-ranked sect challenging the top-ranked Great Sun Thunder Sect! </p><p></p><p>They even doubted if they were dreaming, but the crimson golden characters were clearly etched in the sky, telling them this was real!</p><p></p><p>Unprecedented, unprecedented!</p><p></p><p>How dare the unknown Xiaoyao Sect do this!</p><p></p><p>"Setting aside other things, the Xiaoyao Sect's audacity is unparalleled, risking even death for the sake of reputation. But alas, that reputation will only be an ill-famed one!"</p><p></p><p>"Don't say that, just tell me if you want to see it or not?"</p><p></p><p>"Haha, of course I want to see it. I'm just afraid the battle beyond their level will be over in an instant. The Great Sun Thunder Sect can easily destroy the Xiaoyao Sect by sending out just one person!"</p><p></p><p>"But undeniably, this move by the Xiaoyao Sect has made them famous. At least now everyone knows there is a nine-ranked sect called Xiaoyao Sect."</p><p></p><p>"......"</p><p></p><p>"I don't think so. Perhaps the Xiaoyao Sect has some tricks up their sleeve?"</p><p></p><p>"Tricks? Before today, they were an obscure sect. If they challenged an eight or even seven-ranked sect, I'd find it interesting. But challenging the deep-rooted top-ranked sect... It's like an ant trying to shake a mountain!"</p><p></p><p>Such discussions echoed throughout the human domain.</p><p></p><p>At the same time, </p><p>Thunder Continent was also in a state of extreme commotion, with countless gazes fixed on the territory of the Great Sun Thunder Sect.</p><p></p><p>Within the Great Sun Thunder Sect,</p><p>After the initial shock, the elders and disciples burst into mocking laughter, but their eyes held a cold glint.</p><p></p><p>What an ignorant nine-ranked sect!</p><p>To dare to try and gain fame by using the Great Sun Thunder Sect!</p><p>Being challenged by a nine-ranked sect, they felt... the ultimate insult.</p><p></p><p>"Silence."</p><p></p><p>At this moment, the voice of Sect Master Lei Chengdong resounded through the entire Great Sun Thunder Sect.</p><p></p><p>Instantly, all sounds died down.</p><p>Everyone's eyes flickered, knowing the Sect Master was likely displeased...</p><p></p><p>But the words that followed from Lei Chengdong left them dumbfounded.</p><p></p><p>"Everyone, go and prepare. We will battle the challenge in three months."</p><p></p><p>The Great Sun Thunder Sect fell into a strange atmosphere, but it only lasted for a moment before they hurriedly bowed and responded, "Yes, Sect Master."</p><p></p><p>In the palace of the Great Sun Thunder Sect,</p><p>Lei Chengdong sat as usual on the meditation cushion, gazing at the statue of Thunder Ancestor, the arcs of lightning flickering in his eyes.</p><p></p><p>Hearing that a nine-ranked sect had challenged his Great Sun Thunder Sect, he was also greatly shocked.</p><p></p><p>But as the current Sect Master of the Great Sun Thunder Sect, he was no fool.</p><p></p><p>This unknown Xiaoyao Sect... might truly have the strength.</p><p>After all, there had never been such a huge gap in a challenge before.</p><p></p><p>Regarding this challenge battle, he would not underestimate it, but neither would he overemphasize it.</p><p>As the Sect Master of the Great Sun Thunder Sect, he naturally had his own pride.</p><p></p><p>However... why did he have a lingering feeling that the Xiaoyao Sect might have another motive?</p><p></p><p>At the same time, in the Extreme Cold Glacier.</p><p>Leaning against the tree trunk, Lu Changsheng opened his eyes, took a sip of wine from his gourd, and then looked at the crimson golden characters in the sky, smiling.</p><p></p><p>Elder Peng's thoughts were indeed quite delicate.</p>

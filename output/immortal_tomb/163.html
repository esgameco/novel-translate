        <h1>Chapter 163</h1>
        <div class="content">
            <p>Here is the full English translation of the Chinese excerpt:</p><p></p><p>"This...this is!" </p><p></p><p>Zuo Qoushen was utterly shocked. Without further thought, he quickly knelt down at the courtyard entrance, closed his eyes, and began to refine. His eyelids were, however, violently trembling.</p><p></p><p>The mysterious power contained in that soup was just too overwhelming...</p><p></p><p>Rumble.</p><p></p><p>Suddenly, a muffled thunder roared in the night sky, and arcs of lightning illuminated the dark night.</p><p></p><p>Zuo Qoushen seemed to sense something, opened his eyes, and looked up. His gaze was filled with excitement!</p><p></p><p>This was the thunder tribulation for a Xian Lord to advance from the middle stage to the late stage.</p><p></p><p>Xian Lords of the sixth and seventh grades were considered the threshold, with the first three grades being the early stage, the fourth to sixth grades being the middle stage, and the seventh to ninth grades being the late stage!</p><p></p><p>The thunderous roars grew louder and more frequent.</p><p></p><p>"What's going on? Is this a thunder tribulation? This intensity, at least a Xian Lord expert, right?"</p><p></p><p>"There are over a dozen Xian Lord experts in the town now, but only the four major powers have those above the third grade. This tribulation doesn't seem to be from anyone below the third grade."</p><p></p><p>"Someone has sent a message saying it's from the Longevity Tavern! Let's go take a look."</p><p></p><p>"The Longevity Tavern? The proprietor must be at the Xian Emperor level, how could it be him?"</p><p></p><p>"I see, it's the Heavenly Snake Manor's lord! But how come he's breaking through so suddenly?"</p><p></p><p>This commotion immediately caught the attention of countless cultivators in Qingxuan Town, including the people of the Heavenly Snake Manor. They quickly rushed towards the Longevity Tavern.</p><p></p><p>Especially Su Qianghe, Zhao Wuyu, and Yin Jiukui. They were shocked at the magnitude of the tribulation... at least a Xian Lord's middle stage breakthrough.</p><p></p><p>As if realizing something, their bodies suddenly trembled, and they immediately flashed towards the Longevity Tavern in the town.</p><p></p><p>Outside the Longevity Tavern.</p><p></p><p>Zuo Qoushen looked up at the sky, his face filled with excitement, completely oblivious to the growing number of cultivators gathering around.</p><p></p><p>His body was trembling with excitement.</p><p></p><p>He never imagined that by being a doorkeeper at the Longevity Tavern, he would receive such a gift from the proprietor!</p><p></p><p>Without exaggeration, this bowl of soup had advanced his plan to take revenge on the Jiang clan by a step!</p><p></p><p>"My adoptive father is about to break through!"</p><p></p><p>"Our lord has become even stronger. From now on, our Heavenly Snake Manor will be the true number one power under the Longevity Tavern!"</p><p></p><p>Outside the tribulation area, the Heavenly Snake Manor members were exhilarated, sharing in the glory.</p><p></p><p>"Zuo, Zuo Qoushen, what are you doing? Why are you breaking through again so suddenly?" </p><p></p><p>Standing in the front, Su Qianghe stared fixedly at Zuo Qoushen, his eyes bloodshot as he demanded an answer.</p><p></p><p>He was so unhappy about this.</p><p></p><p>Beside him, Yin Jiukui's face was also ashen, and while Zhao Wuyu wore a mask, the flickering in his eyes also revealed his discontent.</p><p></p><p>Zuo Qoushen finally turned his head, sweeping his gaze over the crowd, pausing on Li Qizhan and the Heavenly Snake Manor members, before finally resting on the three of them. He hooked the corner of his mouth and laughed, cupping his hands towards the sky.</p><p></p><p>"I was just fortunate enough to receive a bowl of soup from the proprietor. After drinking it, this happened. I can't help it."</p><p></p><p>With that, the crowd was stunned.</p><p></p><p>Good, it was indeed the proprietor's doing!</p><p></p><p>How annoying... to be just a doorkeeper and get such a reward?</p><p></p><p>"Ah, Zuo Qoushen, you really should die!" Su Qianghe clenched his fists, shouting in frustration.</p><p></p><p>He was so jealous.</p><p></p><p>Zuo Qoushen had originally wanted to add some salt to rub it in, but the thunderous roars in the sky were growing increasingly intense, and strangely, the response was delayed.</p><p></p><p>Here is the full English translation of the Chinese excerpt:</p><p></p><p>The rain had not yet subsided.</p><p></p><p>His gaze sharpened, and he suddenly flew towards the remote area outside Qingxuan Town.</p><p></p><p>This was the territory of the Longevity Tavern. If the proprietor's tavern suffered any damage under the thunderstorm, he would feel deeply guilty.</p><p></p><p>As Left Chou-shan moved, the dense thunderclouds in the sky also gradually drifted towards the outskirts of Qingxuan Town.</p><p></p><p>"Damn it, let's go take a look. Hopefully, this guy gets struck by lightning and dies."</p><p></p><p>Su Qianghe muttered unhappily, then rushed towards the outskirts of Qingxuan Town along with countless cultivators.</p><p></p><p>"Wanting to strike him dead might be a bit difficult, as this is just an intermediate tribulation for Immortal Venerable realm," Zhao Wuyou shook his head and sighed.</p><p></p><p>...</p><p></p><p>In the tavern.</p><p></p><p>"Senior brother, why did the Lord of the Heavenly Snake Manor drink the soup and then get struck by lightning? He's already at the Immortal Venerable realm."</p><p></p><p>Hearing the thunderous sounds outside, Lin Dong asked puzzledly and enviously.</p><p></p><p>It was strange that they had all drunk the same soup, yet it had such a powerful effect on Left Chou-shan, allowing him to break through to the Immortal Venerable realm. The soup must have contained an immense amount of spiritual energy, beyond their imagination.</p><p></p><p>Why didn't they experience such a domineering effect?</p><p></p><p>Tong Xin scratched his head and chuckled awkwardly, "How would I know?"</p><p></p><p>"Senior brother, what realm are you at now?" Lin Dong asked.</p><p></p><p>Tong Xin blinked and smiled, "I, your senior brother, am now at the Fifth-Grade Celestial Immortal realm."</p><p></p><p>"Oh, I'm at the Fourth-Grade Celestial Immortal realm. But why is it that we never have any lightning tribulations when we break through? It's really strange."</p><p></p><p>Lin Dong wondered.</p><p></p><p>"If you two want to undergo the lightning tribulation, you should go outside when you break through. The tribulation won't strike inside the tavern," came the voice of Lu Changsheng from the inner room.</p><p></p><p>Tong Xin and Lin Dong quickly stood up from their seats and bowed, "Yes, sir."</p><p></p><p>Soon, the thunderous sounds outside gradually subsided.</p><p></p><p>Tong Xin and Lin Dong exchanged a glance, then each returned to their rooms to cultivate.</p><p></p><p>...</p><p></p><p>The next day, Tong Xin and Lin Dong walked out of the tavern. Before they even reached the courtyard gate, they heard a conversation outside.</p><p></p><p>"Su Qianghe, Yin Jiudui, Zhao Wuyou, your names are not yet on the queue list today. Leave immediately and don't cause any trouble, or else don't blame the Lord of this Manor for not remembering our past friendship."</p><p></p><p>"Lord Left, I, Su Qianghe, naturally know that our turn has not yet come. But we're not here to drink, we have something to discuss with the proprietor. It shouldn't concern you, should it?"</p><p></p><p>"Hehe, Lord Left is now a Seventh-Grade Immortal Venerable, completely disregarding us. But Lord Left is still a doorkeeper at the tavern, shouldn't you dare to leave your post? What if your Heavenly Snake Manor is invaded by unscrupulous people?"</p><p></p><p>"How dare you threaten the Lord of this Manor?"</p><p></p><p>"..."</p><p></p><p>With a creak, Tong Xin and Lin Dong pushed open the courtyard gate.</p><p></p><p>Su Qianghe was delighted, and the three hurriedly stepped forward, hoping to ask,</p><p></p><p>"Little Two, can we see the proprietor?"</p><p></p><p>Tong Xin cleared his throat apologetically, "I'm sorry, gentlemen, but our proprietor is resting. We don't dare to disturb him."</p><p></p><p>The faces of Su Qianghe's group stiffened, and they chuckled awkwardly.</p><p></p><p>"No problem, no problem. Our turn on the queue list will come soon enough. We'll come back another day."</p><p></p><p>With that, the three looked at Left Chou-shan and then left one by one.</p><p></p><p>Seeing this, Left Chou-shan, though expressionless on the surface, secretly heaved a sigh of relief. These three fellows, seeing the great benefits he had obtained from the proprietor, must be wanting to come and seek employment here! How shameless!</p><p></p><p>He then looked at the cultivators standing in line in front of him, furrowed his brows, and sternly commanded, "The first batch, enter. Once you're in the tavern, behave yourselves properly. Greet the proprietor respectfully when you see him, or else the Lord of this Manor will make you regret it!"</p><p></p><p>"Yes, yes, yes..."</p><p></p><p>Soon, the first batch of cultivators followed Tong Xin and Lin Dong into the tavern.</p>

        <h1>Chapter 148</h1>
        <div class="content">
            <p>Here is the full English translation of the Chinese excerpt:</p><p></p><p>In a remote corner of Qingxuan Town. ‚ô†üê≥‚ûÖÔºôsƒßùì§◊ê.·∂ú‚ìû‡πìüëªüë§</p><p></p><p>This place used to have almost no foot traffic, but today it was unusually bustling.</p><p></p><p>The crowd surrounded the ordinary-looking tavern, three layers deep, their gazes mostly mocking as they examined it.</p><p></p><p>The tavern had two floors, plain and unremarkable, no different from any other tavern. It had an enclosed courtyard outside, which was quite spacious, with flowers, grass, and a pond.</p><p></p><p>But the most eye-catching thing was the plaque hanging on the tightly closed courtyard gate, upon which were carved the four grand characters "Longevity Tavern" in a flourishing dragon-and-phoenix script.</p><p></p><p>Many people looked up at the plaque disdainfully, pointing and muttering.</p><p></p><p>"Heh, I had doubts before, but who would have thought this tavern would actually be named 'Longevity'? How presumptuous! Doesn't the owner know this is the Black Calamity Domain?"</p><p></p><p>"Haha, with so many fellow daoists here today, and we are all people of the Black Calamity Domain, surely there won't be a simple character among us. Definitely many will make trouble for this tavern."</p><p></p><p>"That's right, in this Black Calamity Domain, if you want to be bold, you'd better have the ability. If you're bold without ability, in the end you'll be eaten to the last scrap!"</p><p></p><p>"Hehe, let's just wait and see. Haven't you noticed that everyone is still hesitant to make a move? But ultimately, who was the one who said the tavern was opening today? Why is the courtyard gate still tightly closed?"</p><p></p><p>"Let it be closed. More and more people have come to watch the show. This Longevity Tavern has to open today, whether they want to or not!"</p><p></p><p>"Everyone, I'll be the banker today. How about a round?" </p><p></p><p>Suddenly, a fat man chuckled sinisterly and spoke loudly.</p><p></p><p>At this, the area fell silent, and many looked at the fat man with the eyes of looking at a fool.</p><p></p><p>Who would dare to be the banker in this situation? Barring any surprises, this tavern was going to be utterly crushed today.</p><p></p><p>Wouldn't the banker just end up losing everything?</p><p></p><p>With so many people here, could this dead fatty afford the losses?</p><p></p><p>"Are you all too scared?" The fat man's eyes flashed, and he thumped his chest proudly. "Don't worry, I, Peng Fang, may not have much, but I have spirit stones, plenty of them!"</p><p></p><p>Instantly, the expressions of the crowd changed, and they all eyed Peng Fang with malicious gazes.</p><p></p><p>What a guy, actually saying they were too scared?</p><p></p><p>Come on, they were all ruthless characters of the Black Calamity Domain, what was there for them to be afraid of?</p><p></p><p>The reason many of them had hesitated was only one - the odds of winning would be extremely low!</p><p></p><p>What could they possibly gain from this? </p><p></p><p>But then again, even if they didn't gain much, being able to make this annoying fatty lose everything would be satisfactory enough!</p><p></p><p>So, many people started to crowd around Peng Fang, placing their bets.</p><p></p><p>It quickly became a lively, bustling scene.</p><p></p><p>Peng Fang wore a grinning, gleeful expression, his eyes filled with madness and cunning!</p><p></p><p>There wasn't a single normal person in this Black Calamity Domain.</p><p></p><p>However, there were also quite a few who remained unmoved, standing with their arms crossed, coldly observing, their impatience growing increasingly evident.</p><p></p><p>"Oh? So it's truly named 'Longevity'? How presumptuous."</p><p></p><p>Amidst the vast crowd, Zuo Qizhan lazily waved his folding fan, his gaze filled with amusement as he looked at the tavern.</p><p></p><p>Behind him, his maidservant was indignant and ashamed, as the crowded environment had led to many "wandering hands" brushing against her in various places.</p><p></p><p>"Hehe, you delicate little scholar, your maidservant, I fancy her. Name your price!"</p><p></p><p>At this moment, a burly man nearby sniffed the lingering fragrance on his hand and laughed lewdly.</p><p></p><p>Zuo Qizhan's brow furrowed slightly, and he turned to look at the burly man, saying indifferently, "What if I don't want to sell her to you?"</p><p></p><p>"Hm?"</p><p></p><p>The burly man's brow immediately furrowed, and he looked quite surprised. He slowly lowered his hand and stared at Zuo Qizhan, saying, "Say that again."</p><p></p><p>…Øo…îÀôx</p><p></p><p>Here is the full English translation of the excerpt from the Chinese novel:</p><p></p><p>At the same time, four or five people slowly surrounded Left Qi Ran and the maid, their expressions fierce and menacing. </p><p></p><p>They had the air of being ready to attack at the slightest provocation.</p><p></p><p>The commotion attracted the attention of many onlookers, and numerous curious gazes turned towards the scene.</p><p></p><p>For this kind of incident, no one was surprised - it was perfectly normal in the Black Abyss Domain, with countless similar events happening every day.</p><p></p><p>Left Qi Ran's expression was blank, and she did not respond. But a flash of light gleamed in the depths of her eyes!</p><p></p><p>Suddenly, a purple shadow burst out from within her clothing!</p><p></p><p>The burly men's expressions changed - they never expected this frail scholar to be more fierce than them. Before they could react, the purple shadow had swiftly passed over their heads.</p><p></p><p>The men's expressions instantly froze, their eyes filled with terror as they looked at Left Qi Ran. Finally, with a 'bang', they fell to the ground, lifeless.</p><p></p><p>For a moment, it grew slightly quieter outside the tavern, even the onlookers who had been betting paused to look over.</p><p></p><p>They saw the five corpses on the ground, their faces frozen in terror, unpeaceful in death, each with a small hole in their forehead, blood still flowing.</p><p></p><p>For this kind of incident, the onlookers merely felt a momentary surprise, without much other reaction. However, their gazes towards the instigator now held a hint of wariness.</p><p></p><p>Inwardly, they sighed - the Black Abyss Domain truly lived up to its name. This frail-looking scholar turned out to be a ruthless character.</p><p></p><p>The maid stood behind Left Qi Ran, head bowed, secretly relieved.</p><p></p><p>Left Qi Ran's eyes flickered. She naturally knew that this method would not truly intimidate these battle-hardened veterans. But she didn't mind - intimidating these people was not her goal for today.</p><p></p><p>She looked towards the tavern, murmuring to herself, "If they don't open the doors soon, this young master will have to barge in..."</p><p></p><p>...</p><p></p><p>"Brother, what's going on? Why are there so many people outside the tavern?" Lin Dong asked in surprise as he wiped the tables.</p><p></p><p>Tong Xin flung the rag over his shoulder and chuckled, "Don't you know? Today is the grand opening of our Longevity Tavern. These people are definitely here to show their support for the Master."</p><p></p><p>The two wore coarse linen clothes and hats, with the signature rag, fitting the image of lowly servers.</p><p></p><p>Lin Dong paused in his wiping, looking up with reverence. "I see, no wonder the Master has such influence, wherever he goes."</p><p></p><p>At this moment, a man in blue robes appeared behind them. "Tong Xin, are you slacking off again?"</p><p></p><p>It was none other than Lu Changsheng.</p><p></p><p>Lin Dong and Tong Xin jumped in fright, quickly turning around and bowing respectfully. "Master..."</p><p></p><p>Tong Xin's face paled - he had just taken a short break and was caught by the Master. How unlucky.</p><p></p><p>Seeing their fearful expressions, Lu Changsheng smiled and walked behind the counter, leisurely settling into a rocking chair. He took a sip from a gourd and said, "Go open the tavern gates, it's time to officially open the Longevity Tavern today."</p><p></p><p>Relieved that the Master did not reprimand them, Tong Xin let out a big sigh of relief, then smiled. "Alright."</p><p></p><p>The two respectfully bowed, and Tong Xin dragged Lin Dong towards the entrance.</p><p></p><p>With a creaking sound, the crowd perked up.</p><p></p><p>The gates of the Longevity Tavern slowly opened before their eyes, revealing the two linen-clad servers.</p>

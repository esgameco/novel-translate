        <h1>Chapter 500</h1>
        <div class="content">
            <p>Here is my translation of the Chinese excerpt:</p><p></p><p>The words fell.</p><p></p><p>All eyes turned to the standing Chu You, with disbelief in their eyes.</p><p></p><p>Especially the Chu clan leader and the Chu clan members, their gazes trembling as they looked at their Chu clan's most promising son.</p><p></p><p>No wonder, no wonder on the Ascending Heaven Island, it was precisely their Chu clan that suffered...</p><p></p><p>It turns out that it was all the credit of their Third Light Son.</p><p></p><p>Hidden so deeply, hidden too deeply!</p><p></p><p>The Chu clan members no longer wanted to think about anything else,</p><p></p><p>They now only want to know, what kind of abilities does their Third Light Son have to provoke such a figure, does he deserve it?</p><p></p><p>Chu You was now in a state of chaos and trembling, his body shaking like a sieve.</p><p></p><p>There was no longer any of the heroic spirit of the Third Light Son.</p><p></p><p>Even the arrogance in the Heavenly Realm seemed like a dream that had never happened.</p><p></p><p>Lu Changsheng stood with his hands behind his back and said indifferently, "I'll only give you ten breaths of time, if you can't regain your arrogance in ten breaths, then I'll make a move, one breath..."</p><p></p><p>Suddenly, Chu You's heart raced!</p><p></p><p>The Chu clan members also frantically signaled Chu You to hurry up!</p><p></p><p>As for the other strong figures present, they only felt a sense of oppression in their hearts, but also extremely exciting!</p><p></p><p>Extremely exciting!</p><p></p><p>After all, no one had ever thought that one day, just ten breaths of time would determine the life and death of one of the nine supreme powers of the Three Thousand Realms!</p><p></p><p>"Two breaths."</p><p></p><p>When Chu You was still dazed, Lu Changsheng's soul-stirring voice sounded again, frightening Chu You to collapse to the ground!</p><p></p><p>Looking at the whole scene, Chu You was definitely the one under the greatest pressure.</p><p></p><p>For some reason, the ten breaths that used to be nothing were now passing very slowly, each breath deeply tormenting Chu You!</p><p></p><p>"Three breaths."</p><p></p><p>When the voice came again like the scythe of the Grim Reaper, everyone's hearts jumped sharply!</p><p></p><p>At this time, Chu You tremblingly stood up from the ground, his hand shaking as he pointed at Lu Changsheng, stammering:</p><p></p><p>"Lu, Lu Changsheng! I am, I am the Third Light Son of the Chu Clan, the future, the future Light Saint of the Three Thousand Realms!! You, you don't want to die!!"</p><p></p><p>The words were harsh, but the tone, even a fool could hear how terrified Chu You was.</p><p></p><p>Tears even welled up in the corners of Chu You's eyes, as if he was about to collapse at any moment!</p><p></p><p>"Not enough, it's far from that day..."</p><p></p><p>Lu Changsheng smiled lightly and continued, "Four breaths."</p><p></p><p>The old turtle's eyes rolled, and he quickly took out a stool from his spatial storage and placed it behind Lu Changsheng.</p><p></p><p>Lu Changsheng sat down, leaning back slightly, his ten fingers interlocked in front of him, with a slight arc at the corners of his mouth, watching Chu You's performance like watching a show.</p><p></p><p>This is still far from it?!</p><p></p><p>The crowd was startled, although Chu You's state was quite pitiful, the content of his words was definitely harsh!</p><p></p><p>This is still far from it, then how arrogant was Chu You in front of this great figure in the past?</p><p></p><p>Dare not imagine, completely dare not imagine.</p><p></p><p>Anyway, it's definitely on the verge of courting death!</p><p></p><p>"Lu, Lu Changsheng! I'll let you have the guts to come to the Realm of the Laws! Unexpectedly, you, this insect, really dare, dare to come!"</p><p></p><p>"Five breaths."</p><p></p><p>"Lu, Changsheng! What are you, just know how to bully the weak! You...you're just a coward..."</p><p></p><p>"Six breaths."</p><p></p><p>"Lu Changsheng, you..."</p><p></p><p>"Seven breaths."</p><p></p><p>"Lu..."</p><p></p><p>"Eight breaths."</p><p></p><p>"I, Chu You, as the Third Light Son of the Chu Clan, with unparalleled talents in the Three Thousand Realms, you, this..."</p><p></p><p>"Nine breaths."</p><p></p><p>"Great, great man, Chu You is blind and ignorant, wuwuwu, he has offended you, please forgive him!!"</p><p></p><p>In the last breath, Chu You completely collapsed, covering his head and kneeling down, frantically kowtowing 'bang bang bang bang', crying bitterly!</p><p></p><p>"Ten breaths."</p><p></p><p>Here is the full English translation of the Chinese excerpt:</p><p></p><p>Lü Changsheng spoke in a calm manner, as if he were the sovereign, ruling over everything.</p><p></p><p>The entire venue fell into complete silence, and the hearts of the crowd seemed to have stopped beating!</p><p></p><p>At this moment, Chu You had been completely driven to madness!</p><p></p><p>Chu You suddenly stood up from the ground, the veins on his neck bulging!</p><p></p><p>He pointed his finger at Lü Changsheng, his face contorted with ferocity and insanity, and he roared:</p><p></p><p>"Lü! Changsheng! You are a piece of trash! Trash!!! You will not have a good end! No!!! Ah, you piece of trash!!!"</p><p></p><p>Lü Changsheng, however, was not angered. Instead, his eyes even brightened slightly, and he praised with a rare smile: "Not bad, the defiant you has returned."</p><p></p><p>Chu You was stunned!</p><p></p><p>The members of the Chu Clan, who were on the verge of despair, also felt a surge of joy in their hearts!</p><p></p><p>Were they saved?</p><p></p><p>Did they not have to die?</p><p></p><p>Had Chu You successfully regained his former defiance?</p><p></p><p>Lü Changsheng slowly stood up from the chair, clapped his hands, and then walked in front of Chu You, sighing lightly:</p><p></p><p>"But ten breaths have already passed, and you failed to seize the opportunity in time... I feel regretful for you."</p><p></p><p>The members of the Chu Clan turned deathly pale, wanting to resist, but were suppressed by the inexplicable pressure!</p><p></p><p>"Ah, ah, ah, ah! I will kill you! You demon!!!"</p><p></p><p>Chu You suddenly swung his fist towards Lü Changsheng, and his entire body erupted with dazzling light!!</p><p></p><p>The hearts of all present sank!</p><p></p><p>Lü Changsheng smiled, not hurrying to block or counterattack.</p><p></p><p>Because Chu You's movements might be extremely fast in the eyes of others, after all, that was the speed of light.</p><p></p><p>But in the eyes of this Dao Venerable, it was as if it had been slowed down countless times!</p><p></p><p>Every subtle movement was full of flaws!</p><p></p><p>Even if Lü Changsheng stood still, Chu You would not be able to inflict the slightest harm on him, not even a tickle.</p><p></p><p>Lü Changsheng wanted to laugh because the ant before him, who had once wanted to refine the entire Void Ancient Realm for his own selfish desires, now called him a demon.</p><p></p><p>The next moment!</p><p></p><p>Chu You suddenly seemed to have been struck hard, his pupils constricting, and he collapsed on the ground like a pile of mud, with white foam and fresh blood coming out of the corners of his mouth.</p><p></p><p>No one had seen how Lü Changsheng had struck!</p><p></p><p>They only felt an even greater fear in their hearts!</p><p></p><p>Lü Changsheng raised his foot and lightly stepped on Chu You's head, saying indifferently, "Next, open your eyes wide and enjoy the consequences you have brought about."</p><p></p><p>As soon as the words fell, a scene suddenly appeared in the venue!</p><p></p><p>The scene showed a magnificent architecture spanning hundreds of millions of miles, and one could even vaguely see countless figures like ants moving within it!</p><p></p><p>The Chu Clan?!</p><p></p><p>The people present narrowed their eyes, immediately recognizing this as the Chu Clan!!</p><p></p><p>The Chu Clan's patriarch and his offspring turned from deathly pale to deep red!</p><p></p><p>The disheveled Chu You's eyes were even wider than a cow's, and he seemed to have some premonition in his heart. He wanted to turn his head, he wanted to close his eyes, but he just couldn't do it!</p><p></p><p>Lü Changsheng's face was expressionless as he slapped out into the void!</p><p></p><p>This slap did not create any ripples or sound.</p><p></p><p>But the people present were horrified to feel the ground and space in the venue violently shaking!</p><p></p><p>They instinctively looked towards the scene, and were horrified to see a gigantic palm-like shadow, covering hundreds of millions of miles, descending from the sky and slamming down towards the Chu Clan below!!</p><p></p><p>Chu You stared wide-eyed at the scene, and then let out a howl like a wild beast:</p><p></p><p>"No! No! No!!!"</p>

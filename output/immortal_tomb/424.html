        <h1>Chapter 424</h1>
        <div class="content">
            <p>Here is the full English translation of the Chinese excerpt:</p><p></p><p>The next morning, Ye Xunwang and Yun Aoye came to the courtyard outside Youting Lake to wait respectfully.</p><p></p><p>Zhu Guoyuan's principle was to accompany them cautiously.</p><p></p><p>However, what puzzled Zhu Guoyuan was that Luo Qian was nowhere to be seen? </p><p></p><p>If he was discovered by the Ninth Prince and the Qin Saint, that fellow Luo Qian wouldn't even know how he died.</p><p></p><p>Of course, if he died, it would be even better, then the Qinglian seed would be completely safe.</p><p></p><p>Creak.</p><p></p><p>The courtyard gate opened.</p><p></p><p>Lu Changsheng slowly walked out, with Old Turtle respectfully following behind him.</p><p></p><p>"My lord!" </p><p></p><p>Ye Xunwang and the others hurriedly paid their respects.</p><p></p><p>"Mm, let's set out then, no need to delay further," Lu Changsheng said with a smile.</p><p></p><p>"Yes, yes, yes!"</p><p></p><p>Ye Xunwang was delighted, and quickly looked at Yun Aoye.</p><p></p><p>Yun Aoye immediately understood, summoning a palanquin and bowing to invite Lu Changsheng to enter.</p><p></p><p>As for why there was only one palanquin, it was naturally because with Lu Changsheng present, Ye Xunwang and Yun Aoye did not dare to be too comfortable, for fear of leaving a bad impression on Lu Changsheng.</p><p></p><p>Lu Changsheng nodded slightly and stepped into the palanquin to sit down.</p><p></p><p>As for Old Turtle, Ye Xunwang, Yun Aoye, and their four subordinates, fortunately the palanquin was quite large, and there was ample space outside.</p><p></p><p>Zhu Guoyuan watched as the group, including Yun Aoye, one by one boarded the palanquin. His heart trembled as he realized they were about to depart, and he hurriedly said respectfully:</p><p></p><p>"Ninth Prince, Qin Saint, are you about to return to the capital? I have not prepared anything, the Ninth Prince's return to the capital is such an important matter, the citizens should see you off, why doesn't the Ninth Prince stay a few more days in my Tianxiang City, so that I can..."</p><p></p><p>But before Zhu Guoyuan could finish, Yun Aoye let out a laugh and waved his hand, saying, "City Lord Zhu, there's no need to go to such trouble."</p><p></p><p>With that, Yun Aoye unhesitatingly waved his hand, and the palanquin took flight, disappearing into the distance as a pillar of light!</p><p></p><p>Zhu Guoyuan stood there dumbfounded for a moment, then remembered the blue-robed man in the palanquin who was treated with the utmost respect even by the Ninth Prince and the Qin Saint, and couldn't help but sigh towards the heavens.</p><p></p><p>True, the world is ever-changing...</p><p></p><p>But overall, for his Zhu Mansion, this was not a bad thing.</p><p></p><p>Not only did he become the City Lord, but Qing Qing was also spared from the Ninth Prince's malice...</p><p></p><p>As for the late Guo Xiong, the remaining Luo Qian, Zhu Guoyuan had ways to deal with him!</p><p></p><p>Thinking this, Zhu Guoyuan's expression darkened, and he was about to go back to devise a plan to deal with Luo Qian, when a subordinate's report reached his ears: "City Lord, just now, news came from the Luo Mansion, the Luo Mansion Master Luo Qian's life lamp has been extinguished!"</p><p></p><p>Ah?</p><p></p><p>Zhu Guoyuan was taken aback, struggling to suppress the joy and disbelief in his heart, and then roared, "Investigate! Verify the authenticity for this City Lord!"</p><p></p><p>"Yes!"</p><p></p><p>...</p><p></p><p>In the Zhu Mansion.</p><p></p><p>Zhu Qingqing was still sitting there, diligently painting.</p><p></p><p>Xiao Lian quietly came up behind Zhu Qingqing, saw the painting of Youting Lake and the blue-robed figure, and couldn't help but sigh, "Miss, the Qin Saint, the blue-robed gentleman, have already left."</p><p></p><p>Zhu Qingqing's brush paused for a moment, and she smiled, "Of course I know, can I not paint the Qin Saint I admire?"</p><p></p><p>Zhu Qingqing's mind was clear, the bright moon and the fireflies, she could certainly distinguish them.</p><p></p><p>Moreover, not to mention the difference in status and various aspects, from the beginning to the end, it was only her indulging in a one-sided affection.</p><p></p><p>The most important thing was, she didn't even know his name.</p><p></p><p>...</p><p></p><p>The palanquin soared through the sky, passing over many regions and cities, getting closer and closer to the capital.</p><p></p><p>In the palanquin, a voice suddenly rang out in Yun Aoye's mind, it was Ye Xunwang:</p><p></p><p>"Aoye, we're about to arrive at the capital soon, you quickly send a message to your father the King, briefly describe the situation, and then have him prepare to welcome the arrival of the blue-robed gentleman!"</p><p></p><p>Hearing this, Yun Aoye turned his head and carefully glanced at the figure behind the curtain, then turned back and smiled bitterly, "Uncle Ye, why don't you go tell my father the King? I'm afraid I might not be able to explain it properly."</p><p></p><p>Here is the full English translation of the Chinese excerpt:</p><p></p><p>"My father the King does not believe it......" </p><p></p><p>Hearing this, Ye Xun felt that it was indeed the case. For such a big matter, it was indeed not appropriate for Ao Xie to tell his father the King directly. He then nodded and closed his eyes, no longer speaking.</p><p></p><p>Cloud Ao Xie also did not disturb him further, knowing that Ye Xun was now preparing to communicate with his father.</p><p></p><p>At the same time, in the royal palace of the capital.</p><p></p><p>Cloud Ze Cang was sitting in the main hall, his face gloomy as he looked down at the officials kneeling before him.</p><p></p><p>"A group of useless freeloaders."</p><p></p><p>The officials kneeled, not daring to respond.</p><p></p><p>Cloud Ze Cang rubbed his brow and muttered to himself, "Ah, this King should first summon his wise younger brother back."</p><p></p><p>With that, Cloud Ze Cang planned to get in touch with Ye Xun.</p><p></p><p>But just then, Cloud Ze Cang's eyes widened, for Ye Xun had actually contacted him?</p><p></p><p>Cloud Ze Cang immediately closed his eyes and had a remote dialogue with Ye Xun in his mind.</p><p></p><p>"Wise younger brother, how coincidental, this King was just about to seek you, and you have already contacted this King."</p><p></p><p>"Your Majesty, Ao Xie and I will be returning to the capital soon......"</p><p></p><p>"Oh? Very good, wise younger brother......"</p><p></p><p>"Your Majesty, first let me finish. Accompanying Ao Xie and I is also a super important figure. You must immediately arrange a reception, and you must personally lead the officials to welcome him!"</p><p></p><p>"Ah?"</p><p></p><p>A super important figure?</p><p></p><p>Cloud Ze Cang's eyelids twitched, and he was also very puzzled at the same time.</p><p></p><p>His wise younger brother and Ao Xie had just gone to Tianxiang City, and what great figure could there be in his Cloud Lan Ancient Kingdom?</p><p></p><p>However, these words came from Ye Xun, and Cloud Ze Cang could not help but be cautious.</p><p></p><p>If it were anyone else, Cloud Ze Cang would not believe it a thousand times, but he knew Ye Xun's character would not joke around.</p><p></p><p>"Wise younger brother, you...briefly tell me about it?"</p><p></p><p>"Ah, Your Majesty, the great figure is right beside me now, I cannot talk to you for too long, for fear that the great figure may suddenly give an order. You just need to know that a single move from one of the great figure's servants can crush me... Your Majesty, we will arrive soon, you must hurry and prepare."</p><p></p><p>After saying this, Ye Xun cut off the communication from the other end.</p><p></p><p>Ugh!</p><p></p><p>Cloud Ze Cang suddenly stood up in the main hall, his eyes wide open, filled with alarm!</p><p></p><p>The officials below trembled, puzzled and uncertain about what had happened to the King.</p><p></p><p>Cloud Ze Cang looked towards the direction of the capital, and said in a solemn voice:</p><p></p><p>"You all follow this King to the east gate of the capital to welcome the great figure!"</p><p></p><p>Ah? Welcome the great figure? Welcome what great figure?</p><p></p><p>Could it be that the Qin Saint has returned? But even if the Qin Saint has returned, would it really require such a grand reception?</p><p></p><p>"Follow this King, and I will tell you all on the way."</p><p></p><p>Cloud Ze Cang said a sentence, and then led the puzzled but daring officials to rush towards the east gate.</p><p></p><p>......</p><p></p><p>At the east gate of the capital.</p><p></p><p>Countless people were passing through the gate, some leaving the capital, some entering.</p><p></p><p>But at this moment, the figures of Cloud Ze Cang and the officials appeared on the city wall above the east gate.</p><p></p><p>The guards, sensing the aura, were immediately startled, and their trembling eyes looked up at the city wall, stammering, "Your Majesty! Your Majesty!"</p><p></p><p>Instantly, all the bewildered gazes below were lifted towards the city wall.</p><p></p><p>The King?</p><p></p><p>The King!</p><p></p><p>The next moment, all the people below the east gate hurriedly knelt on the ground, loudly paying their respects, "Greetings to Your Majesty!!"</p><p></p><p>The people could not believe it, why would the King come to the east gate in person, and it seemed he had brought the entire capital's high-ranking officials with him.</p><p></p><p>Cloud Ze Cang said indifferently, "Convey this King's order, from this moment on, clear the east gate, and until further notice, no one is allowed to approach!"</p>

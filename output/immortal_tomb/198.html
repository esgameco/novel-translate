        <h1>Chapter 198</h1>
        <div class="content">
            <p>Here is the full English translation of the excerpt from the Chinese novel:</p><p></p><p>After Lin Dong returned to his original position, </p><p></p><p>the eyes of the many elder executives were filled with admiration. </p><p></p><p>Peng Fang then smiled and said,</p><p></p><p>"There are only two and a half years left until the Grand Competition of the Ten Thousand Sects. For us cultivators, it will pass in the blink of an eye. All elders, executive protectors, and disciples must go down and cultivate diligently!"</p><p></p><p>"Two and a half years from today, everyone shall gather at the martial field on their own!"</p><p></p><p>"We will head to the first stop of the Grand Competition of the Ten Thousand Sects - the Extreme Cold Ice Plains!"</p><p></p><p>The crowd respectfully responded, and one by one they retreated.</p><p></p><p>The newly promoted disciples felt a little regretful, as they had the honor of hearing the Sect Master's voice today, but did not get to see his appearance.</p><p></p><p>...</p><p></p><p>Miscellaneous Peak.</p><p></p><p>After returning from the martial field, the miscellaneous disciples were extremely excited and discussed animatedly:</p><p></p><p>"To be able to join the Carefree Sect, it must have exhausted all our lifetime's fortune. Even until now, I still feel like I'm dreaming."</p><p></p><p>"Yes, although with our natural talents and abilities, we could have become inner disciples of Blood Flame Pavilion, Profound Heavenly Gate, or Rainbow Pavilion, but those three sects are nothing compared to the Carefree Sect!"</p><p></p><p>"In our previous view, even a ninth-grade sect was already very powerful, but now our horizons have truly been broadened. A ninth-grade sect like Blood Flame Pavilion is not even worth a dog's attention."</p><p></p><p>"That's right, sects like Blood Flame Pavilion are nothing to our Carefree Sect. Not only our elders and executives, even our core disciples could easily destroy them! No wonder the other day, the elders of Blood Flame Pavilion and Profound Heavenly Gate came to pay respects, but our Grand Executive didn't even bother to entertain them."</p><p></p><p>"Fellow disciples, we must cultivate diligently. The Grand Competition of the Ten Thousand Sects is a battle for the entire sect. Although we are miscellaneous disciples, we must try our best not to drag the sect down!"</p><p></p><p>"......"</p><p></p><p>Soon, someone looked at Cai Xu and Huang Bin and teased, </p><p></p><p>"Little black guys, Abin, you two must quickly break through to the Earthly Immortal Realm. Nowadays, you two are dragging down the lower limit of the sect's strength."</p><p></p><p>The crowd laughed cheerfully upon hearing this, but there was no sense of looking down on them.</p><p></p><p>They all knew that Cai Xu and Huang Bin had joined the Carefree Sect earlier than them, and they had seen them during the assessment that day, and were now familiar with them.</p><p></p><p>Moreover, they had heard that Cai Xu and Huang Bin were personally received by the Holy Son when they joined.</p><p></p><p>This really shocked them.</p><p></p><p>For them, even the outer disciples now have high status, not to mention the inner disciples, and the special identity of the Holy Son afterwards.</p><p></p><p>That is an existence they look up to!</p><p></p><p>Hearing this, Cai Xu and Huang Bin's faces flushed slightly, and they glanced at each other awkwardly.</p><p></p><p>Indeed, they were really dragging down the sect's standards.</p><p></p><p>No, with two and a half years left, they must cultivate diligently. In any case, they must break through to the Earthly Immortal Realm!</p><p></p><p>"Hehe, don't worry everyone, Abin and I will go cultivate right away, we definitely won't drag the sect down!"</p><p></p><p>Cai Xu smiled and left with Huang Bin in a hurry.</p><p></p><p>"Haha haha." The miscellaneous disciples saw this and burst out laughing.</p><p></p><p>"You bunch of miscellaneous disciples, don't think you don't have to cultivate! The Grand Competition of the Ten Thousand Sects is something you all have to participate in! Whoever laughs again, will lose their spirit stones for this month!"</p><p></p><p>At this moment, the voice of the Miscellaneous Peak executive suddenly rang out.</p><p></p><p>The smiles on the faces of the miscellaneous disciples instantly froze...</p><p></p><p>"Yes!"</p><p></p><p>They respectfully bowed and quickly disappeared without a trace!</p><p></p><p>They now know that the executives of their sect are no ordinary executives!</p><p></p><p>At least they are all Transcendent Immortal Realm and above in cultivation!</p><p></p><p>It's better to run for their lives!</p><p></p><p>At the same time,</p><p></p><p>on the mountain path,</p><p></p><p>Tong Xin and Lin Dong were walking together.</p><p></p><p>The disciples they encountered all respectfully greeted them, and the two responded with gentle smiles.</p><p></p><p>"Junior brother, are you about to undergo the Tribulation?" Tong Xin asked, tilting his head to look at Lin Dong's profile.</p><p></p><p>Lin Dong smiled and nodded, teasing, "Yes, senior brother. You'd better hurry up, I'm about to surpass you."</p><p></p><p>Hearing this, Tong Xin's expression fell, and he punched Lin Dong's chest, sighing, "You little rascal, you're really too fast... Damn it."</p><p></p><p>As Lin Dong's junior brother, his cultivation had caught up to his senior brother, causing an imbalance in his heart.</p><p></p><p>Lin Dong pretended to be in pain, taking a step back, and then smiled, "Senior brother, you can't blame me for this. You were just playing around during the previous period."</p><p></p><p>Here is the full English translation of the Chinese excerpt:</p><p></p><p>"I've actually been in seclusion cultivating this whole time," I said.</p><p></p><p>"That's right, looks like I'll have to change this playful nature of mine. If the Sect Master were here, he'd probably scold me again." Tong Xin sighed, then solemnly said, "Don't worry, over the next two and a half years, I'll find ways to break through to the Great Luo Golden Immortal realm!"</p><p></p><p>"Shidi, farewell."</p><p></p><p>With that, he took a step and disappeared.</p><p></p><p>Lin Dong looked at the direction Tong Xin left, a slight smile on his lips for a moment, then his expression turned serious as he gazed towards the back mountain, knowing that the Sect Master was usually there.</p><p></p><p>Recalling the Spiritual Dust Realm, and the care the Sect Master had shown them over the years, Lin Dong's fists clenched, his eyes sharp as an eagle's.</p><p></p><p>In this upcoming Grand Competition of the Ten Thousand Sects... he must strive, to live up to his title of Holy Son, and not let the Sect Master down.</p><p></p><p>...</p><p></p><p>Over these two and a half years, all the talk and news in the Human Realm revolved around the Grand Competition of the Ten Thousand Sects. But during this period, all the sects had fallen silent, as everyone knew they were focusing on cultivation.</p><p></p><p>Though it was only two and a half years, no one dared to slack off at this critical time. Humans always tend to make a last-minute effort, which is normal. But it's undeniable that some were able to unleash their potential under this immense pressure and urgency.</p><p></p><p>For example, a year after Lin Dong successfully broke through to the Great Luo Golden Immortal realm, Tong Xin also managed to do the same. And Little Hei and A Bin finally broke through to the Earth Immortal realm as well. </p><p></p><p>Thus, the minimum cultivation of the Carefree Sect had finally risen from the Tribulation Crossing realm to the Earth Immortal realm. Though their aptitude was average, the Carefree Sect's abundant resources, combined with their intense efforts under pressure, allowed them to achieve this.</p><p></p><p>Two and a half years passed in the blink of an eye, especially for cultivators.</p><p></p><p>Today, countless spiritual ships streaked across the sky of the Human Realm, all heading towards the Extreme Cold Ice Field - the venue for the Nine Rank Sect Competition of the Grand Competition of the Ten Thousand Sects. The Nine Rank Sect Competition of the Human Realm would be held in the Extreme Cold Ice Field, while the locations for the Heavenly Realm and Earth Realm were unknown. </p><p></p><p>Ultimately, the top three Nine Rank Sects from each realm would face off in the final showdown.</p><p></p><p>In the region south of the Canglan Continent, the Blood Flame Pavilion, the Forestorm Gate, and the Rainbow Pavilion had set off early that morning, riding spiritual ships towards the Extreme Cold Ice Field. After all, with so many people, and the long distance, it would take some time to reach the Extreme Cold Ice Field.</p><p></p><p>Along the way to the Extreme Cold Ice Field, they would encounter many other sects, and conflicts and battles might even break out before they even reached the Extreme Cold Ice Field.</p><p></p><p>...</p><p></p><p>At the Carefree Sect's training ground, over ten thousand figures stood in neat formation, the atmosphere solemn.</p><p></p><p>Seeing this, Peng Fang and the others exchanged a smile.</p><p></p><p>Peng Fang, with his bulging belly, couldn't help but laugh heartily, "Relax a bit, you all don't need to be so serious. The early battles between the Nine Rank Sects are just child's play to our Carefree Sect."</p><p></p><p>Hearing this, the disciples felt relieved, their expressions easing.</p><p></p><p>That's right, with their Carefree Sect's strength, going to the Extreme Cold Ice Field was just a formality, like a pig pretending to be a tiger.</p><p></p><p>Afterwards, Peng Fang conjured a spiritual ship in his hand, infusing it with spiritual power, then flung it high into the sky. </p><p></p><p>The next moment, a spiritual ship that could cover the sky and block the sun hovered in the air, darkening the heavens.</p><p></p><p>This spiritual ship was large enough to accommodate their tens of thousands of people.</p><p></p><p>"Everyone, board the spiritual ship!" Peng Fang commanded in a low voice.</p><p></p><p>"Yes!"</p><p></p><p>Moments later, on the spiritual ship in the sky.</p><p></p><p>Peng Fang and the other elders and executives stood at the bow railing, their gazes flickering as they looked down at the Carefree Sect below.</p><p></p><p>Tong Xin, Lin Dong, and the other disciples stood behind them, their countless eyes gazing down at their own sect.</p><p></p><p>Peng Fang stood at the very front, taking a deep breath, and leading everyone in a respectful bow, about to say, "Sect Master, we..."</p><p></p><p>But before he could finish, a faint voice drifted from the back mountain of the Carefree Sect, carried by the wind:</p><p></p><p>"As my Carefree Sect's disciples go forth, they need not hold back against any. </p><p></p><p>If provoked, destroy. If challenged, slay."</p>

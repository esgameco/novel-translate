        <h1>Chapter 378</h1>
        <div class="content">
            <p>Here is the full English translation of the Chinese excerpt:</p><p></p><p>"Do you dare to gamble?" </p><p></p><p>As Jian Wuhui's words fell, the expressions of the powerful experts from all tribes slightly changed.</p><p></p><p>The human race, did they know their fate now and were just throwing caution to the wind?</p><p></p><p>But... could Jian Wuhui really destroy the indestructible Liuli Heart?</p><p></p><p>Although the possibility seemed extremely small, they indeed did not dare to gamble, for the Liuli Heart was too important!</p><p></p><p>The Rainbow Liuli Tower had just closed, and the next time it would open would be in five hundred million years!</p><p></p><p>Moreover, who knew how many Liuli Hearts the Rainbow Liuli Tower could still produce, what if they used one less?</p><p></p><p>Shenwei's expression also became somewhat gloomy.</p><p></p><p>This Jian Wuhui, how dare he threaten them...</p><p></p><p>At this time, behind Jian Wuhui, Jiang Wuxin and the others looked at the clearly intimidated tribes, feeling somewhat relieved in their hearts.</p><p></p><p>Indeed, he was the Sword Sovereign, if it were them, they might not be able to withstand the pressure.</p><p></p><p>"How dare you threaten us?" Shenwei stared at Jian Wuhui, coldly saying.</p><p></p><p>Jian Wuhui expressed emotionlessly, "The Third Divine Official's words seem to be biased. We humans are now living day-to-day, how can we talk about threatening or not threatening?"</p><p></p><p>Hearing this, the corner of Shenwei's mouth twitched slightly, he had figured it out - Jian Wuhui was now a barefoot man who was not afraid of wearing shoes.</p><p></p><p>The most hateful thing was that the Liuli Hearts were still in the hands of the human race, otherwise he would not have said so much, and would have directly wiped out the human race.</p><p></p><p>Just as the scene became quiet for a moment,</p><p></p><p>Ao Xing on the other side laughed and said, "Extermination Sword Sovereign, so how are you humans going to do it? All the tribes have come, it's impossible for you to keep confronting us."</p><p></p><p>He guessed that since Jian Wuhui had said so, perhaps there was a solution.</p><p></p><p>Shengluo's face was icy cold, no matter what, the human race would not escape this disaster today.</p><p></p><p>Jian Wuhui glanced at Ao Xing, and then slightly pondered:</p><p></p><p>"The Liuli Hearts, our human race is willing to gift the Celestial Tribe three hundred, and gift the other nine peak tribes two hundred each."</p><p></p><p>"Gift the 11th to 20th largest tribes one hundred each, gift the 21st to 50th largest tribes eighty each, and gift the 51st to 100th largest tribes fifty each."</p><p></p><p>Hearing this, the faces of the top hundred tribes relaxed a bit, Jian Wuhui's distribution was quite reasonable, and even more than before, but...</p><p></p><p>The other tribes' brows slightly furrowed.</p><p></p><p>Just the top hundred tribes, that's eight thousand Liuli Hearts, leaving only two thousand for the remaining tribes to divide?</p><p></p><p>It's not impossible, after all, in the past the top hundred tribes always occupied the majority.</p><p></p><p>They, the other tribes, competing for the remaining two thousand Liuli Hearts, would still not be bad.</p><p></p><p>But just then, Jian Wuhui continued:</p><p></p><p>"In addition, there are still two thousand Liuli Hearts left, and our human race is willing to further gift the top ten peak tribes one hundred each!"</p><p></p><p>Wow!! </p><p></p><p>The entire venue was shocked!!</p><p></p><p>What did Jian Wuhui mean by this?</p><p></p><p>Why did he want to give the top ten peak tribes an extra one hundred each?</p><p></p><p>By what right?</p><p></p><p>Did he intend to let the rest of the tribes fight over the measly one thousand?  Would that be enough for them?</p><p></p><p>As for the top hundred tribes, they remained silent, looking at Jian Wuhui with a deep gaze, </p><p>many of the other tribes had already vaguely guessed Jian Wuhui's intentions...</p><p></p><p>As for the top ten peak tribes, except for the Celestial Tribe and a few others, they all revealed a subtle smile.</p><p></p><p>No matter how, being able to obtain an extra one hundred Liuli Hearts was beneficial without any harm.</p><p></p><p>Jian Wuhui's previous distribution was already a bit more than what they had obtained in the previous session, and now an extra one hundred... Tsk tsk.</p><p></p><p>Here is the full English translation of the Chinese excerpt:</p><p></p><p>Indeed, the next moment, various resentful roars erupted:</p><p></p><p>"Jian Wuhui, not only did you arbitrarily distribute the Liuli Hearts, but you have also been so unfair! With this distribution, how are the rest of us, the myriad tribes, supposed to survive?!"</p><p></p><p>"That's right, you think that by giving the majority to the top hundred clans, your human tribe will be safe? The rest of us myriad tribes can still overwhelm your human tribe!!"</p><p></p><p>"........"</p><p></p><p>Seeing the fierce and restless expressions of the myriad tribes, Jian Wuhui looked towards Ao Xing and the others, and said in a solemn voice:</p><p></p><p>"My human tribe has additionally gifted one thousand Liuli Hearts to the ten tribes. I hope that these ten tribes can fully protect my human tribe!"</p><p></p><p>As Jian Wuhui's words fell, the hearts of the myriad tribes grew cold.</p><p></p><p>What a strategy of using strength to subdue the weak - the human tribe, relying on the Liuli Hearts in their hands...</p><p></p><p>After a moment of silence, the elder beside Ao Xing asked, "Revered Sword Sovereign, with this distribution, what do you plan to do with the remaining one thousand Liuli Hearts?"</p><p></p><p>If Jian Wuhui wanted to secretly hoard the remaining one thousand, the top ten clans would never agree to that!</p><p></p><p>They only had a few hundred, so how could the human tribe solely consume one thousand? </p><p></p><p>And they also had to help the human tribe intimidate the myriad tribes, no matter how you looked at it, it just didn't seem right.</p><p></p><p>If it were to be this way, wouldn't the human tribe be the ultimate winner?</p><p></p><p>Upon hearing this, all eyes in the venue were fixed on the human tribe's camp, </p><p>the countless gazes putting immense pressure on Jiang Wuxin and the others, causing Fang Yin and Mo Liang Qiu's faces to turn slightly pale.</p><p></p><p>Jian Wuhui said indifferently, "As long as it can protect my human tribe, I don't mind distributing the remaining one thousand Liuli Hearts entirely to the top hundred clans."</p><p></p><p>"As long as my human tribe can survive peacefully, I don't need a single Liuli Heart."</p><p></p><p>"After all, the Liuli Hearts are useless without life to enjoy them."</p><p></p><p>Hearing this, the top hundred clans repeatedly nodded their heads, feeling somewhat delighted.</p><p></p><p>In this way, the loss would not be theirs, but rather the myriad tribes outside the top hundred...</p><p></p><p>After all, they wouldn't even get a single one, right?</p><p></p><p>In this case, should they be thanking the human tribe instead?</p><p></p><p>Otherwise, how could such an outcome have occurred.</p><p></p><p>But the hearts of the myriad tribes had grown ice-cold at this moment...</p><p></p><p>Because if it were really like this, they would have no means to oppose the top hundred clans.</p><p>What could they use to object?</p><p></p><p>Jiang Wuxin and the others sighed inwardly, this plan was good, but the human tribe's living environment in the future might become even more hostile, as they had made too many enemies.</p><p></p><p>However, the top priority now was to get through the immediate crisis.</p><p></p><p>"Hahaha! Wonderful! Revered Sword Sovereign, then you should hurry and bring out the Liuli Hearts for us hundred clans to divide!"</p><p></p><p>Bi Qiong laughed heartily.</p><p></p><p>Jian Wuhui pondered for a moment and said, "I can hand them over, but you must take an oath to the Heavenly Dao of the Divine-Demon Battlefield to protect my human tribe after receiving the Liuli Hearts!"</p><p></p><p>Instantly, the powerful experts of the top ten peak clans' expressions changed slightly.</p><p>They were still very resistant to taking the Heavenly Dao oath.</p><p></p><p>The Fire Phoenix Clan's Feng Jun smiled mysteriously: "Taking the Heavenly Dao oath is fine, but Revered Sword Sovereign must not play word games with us... Protecting the human tribe is naturally possible, but there should be a time limit, otherwise for ten thousand years, a hundred thousand years, would we still have to protect them? There is no such eternal benevolence in this world."</p><p></p><p>"Ah, yes!" Bi Qiong reacted: "Set a time limit!"</p><p></p><p>Jian Wuhui lowered his head in thought.</p><p></p><p>"Lord Sword Sovereign, a thousand years would suffice. As long as a thousand years, we can refine the Liuli Hearts, and by then, my human tribe will have produced thousands of Shen Xuan Realm experts!"</p><p></p><p>At this time, Jiang Wuxin's voice transmission reached Jian Wuhui's mind.</p>

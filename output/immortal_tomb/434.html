        <div class="content">
            <p>Here is the full English translation of the Chinese excerpt:</p><p></p><p>Inside the Observation Pavilion, Ye Xunwang ascended step by step, and soon his footsteps halted, his gaze suspicious.</p><p></p><p>What did Ye Xunwang see? He saw a turtle shell swaying there, and there were even snoring sounds coming from it.</p><p></p><p>Huh, in the Observation Pavilion, when did a turtle come in?</p><p></p><p>Ye Xunwang's gaze turned cold, and he decided to discipline the guards later, wanting to ask how they were guarding the Observation Pavilion!</p><p></p><p>Actually being infiltrated by a turtle!</p><p></p><p>Ye Xunwang took a light breath, waving his hand lightly, wanting to lift the turtle, but was surprised to find that he couldn't lift it at all.</p><p></p><p>Huh...</p><p></p><p>Ye Xunwang slowly approached, squatting down to examine the swaying turtle shell suspiciously. Could this turtle have some tricks up its sleeve?</p><p></p><p>Suddenly, a turtle head extended from the shell, grinning and saying, "Oh, little Ye."</p><p></p><p>"Damn!"</p><p></p><p>The carefully examining Ye Xunwang was startled by this sudden scene, stumbling a step back.</p><p></p><p>The old turtle transformed into a human form, looking at Ye Xunwang mockingly: "What brings you to the Observation Pavilion?"</p><p></p><p>"Senior Turtle... ..."</p><p></p><p>Ye Xunwang looked at the old turtle with a wry smile, suddenly understanding.</p><p></p><p>No wonder he's called Old Turtle, originally thought it was just his name, didn't expect his true form to actually be a turtle.</p><p></p><p>Ye Xunwang stood up, dusting off his sleeves and bowing: "Senior Turtle, I came to invite you and your master to a dinner."</p><p></p><p>Dinner?</p><p></p><p>The old turtle waved his hand impatiently, "No, no, there's nothing good to eat, Grandpa Turtle still needs to cultivate, no time, and the master probably has no interest in the dinner either!"</p><p></p><p>Ye Xunwang: "There will be beautiful women dancing."</p><p></p><p>The old turtle: "!"</p><p></p><p>"Wait here, let me go ask the master's intention."</p><p></p><p>The old turtle rubbed his hands and went back.</p><p></p><p>Seeing this, Ye Xunwang had a wry smile on his face.</p><p></p><p>Soon, Ye Xunwang saw Lu Changsheng come out, and his heart rejoiced, hurriedly going up to salute, "My lord."</p><p></p><p>Lu Changsheng stood with his hands behind his back, "Let's go."</p><p></p><p>...</p><p></p><p>The royal palace dinner was held in the Welcoming Pavilion.</p><p></p><p>At this moment, in the Welcoming Pavilion, there were melodious music and lively singing and dancing, with the officials sitting quietly watching the dancing girls in front of them, with beautiful wine, dishes, and fruit plates placed before them.</p><p></p><p>At the forefront, the main seat, King Yunze Cang and Queen Zhang Yan were seated.</p><p></p><p>On the right side, in the first position, was Feng Changxuan and his two generals, and in the second position was Prime Minister Zhang Dao.</p><p></p><p>Behind them were Prince Yao Yihe, Prince Yao Yichong, and other princes and princesses, as well as many high-ranking officials of the Yunlang Kingdom.</p><p></p><p>As for the left first position, it was left empty, the reason unknown.</p><p></p><p>Feng Changxuan discreetly glanced at the empty position opposite, feeling somewhat displeased!</p><p></p><p>This position, why was it left for whom?</p><p></p><p>According to reason, as the Great Prince of the Wind Phoenix, he should have been arranged in the left first position, right?</p><p></p><p>"Princess Ning has arrived!"</p><p></p><p>Just then, a call from outside the pavilion interrupted Feng Changxuan's thoughts.</p><p></p><p>Feng Changxuan's expression became delighted, abruptly standing up from his seat, his gaze burning as he looked towards the pavilion door, soon seeing the elegantly dressed Princess Ning slowly entering the pavilion.</p><p></p><p>"Ning'er!"</p><p></p><p>Feng Changxuan immediately had a smile on his face, going to greet her.</p><p></p><p>But unfortunately, Ning'er's expression was indifferent, directly going to pay respects to Yunze Cang and Zhang Yan: "Princess Ning pays respects to the King and Queen."</p><p></p><p>Feng Changxuan's outstretched arm froze there, a forced smile on his face, feeling the many strange gazes in the pavilion, and a hint of anger also arose in his heart.</p><p></p><p>With so many people watching, Ning'er didn't give him any face at all.</p><p></p><p>"Haha, Ning'er, no need for such formality." Yunze Cang waved his hand and smiled lightly.</p><p></p><p>He naturally also noticed Feng Changxuan's abnormality, and immediately smiled to soothe him:</p><p></p><p>"Great Prince, Ning'er is not familiar with you, the brief encounter in the past, she may have already forgotten."</p><p></p><p>Hearing this, Feng Changxuan felt a bit better, indeed, looking at it this way, it was he who was too eager, and he then cupped his hands and smiled.</p><p></p><p>Here is the full English translation of the Chinese excerpt:</p><p></p><p>"The King said that Changxuan saw the Keninghe had been longing for, and he was anxious for a moment. Normally, Changxuan would not be of such temperament. It is truly Keninghe's deep attraction that has made me, the Crown Prince of Fenglan, lose my composure. Hehe."</p><p></p><p>Towards the end, Feng Changxuan looked at Keninghe, and it was obvious that these words were said for Keninghe to hear.</p><p></p><p>However, upon seeing Keninghe's still expressionless face, Feng Changxuan couldn't help but feel disappointed.</p><p></p><p>But this also greatly aroused his desire to conquer!</p><p></p><p>Good, Feng Changxuan liked this kind of situation, where the sense of conquest would bring him pleasure.</p><p></p><p>"Hehe, Crown Prince, please have a seat first." Cloud Zao said and then looked at Keninghe, tenderly waving his hand: "Keninghe, you will be going to Fenglan tomorrow... Come to your father's side and have a good talk with your father."</p><p></p><p>"Yes, Father." Keninghe then went to the small seat next to Cloud Zao and sat down.</p><p></p><p>Seeing this, Feng Changxuan's gaze showed a slight displeasure. He had originally wanted Keninghe to sit by his side.</p><p></p><p>But Feng Changxuan thought that Keninghe would be going to Fenglan with him tomorrow, so he let it go.</p><p></p><p>He let Keninghe have this last moment with Cloud Zao.</p><p></p><p>Thinking of this, Feng Changxuan reluctantly withdrew his gaze from Keninghe and returned to his seat.</p><p></p><p>But soon, Feng Changxuan became puzzled. He couldn't help but glance at the quietly seated officials, and then mysteriously looked at the empty seat opposite him, and then curiously asked:</p><p></p><p>"Your Majesty, when will the banquet begin? Are we waiting for the esteemed Qin Saint from the guest country?"</p><p></p><p>Upon hearing this, many princes, princesses, and officials had puzzled expressions on their faces. They naturally all knew of the existence of that young man in blue, and thought that this seat must have been specially left by the King for that gentleman.</p><p></p><p>Cloud Zao did not immediately respond, because he was also unsure whether that gentleman would come to the banquet. Although Ye Xunwang had gone to invite him, that gentleman was not someone he could fathom.</p><p></p><p>Seeing this, Feng Changxuan's gaze became more suspicious, and he couldn't help but exchange a glance with his two military generals.</p><p></p><p>Just then, Ye Xunwang's voice rang out in the hall:</p><p></p><p>"Your Majesty, the gentleman has arrived."</p><p></p><p>The palace music abruptly stopped!</p><p></p><p>Cloud Zao's expression changed, and he was the first to stand up from his seat, walking down from the high position towards the palace gate in a slightly hurried manner.</p><p></p><p>Immediately afterwards, the Queen Dowager Zhang Yan, the Crown Prince Cloud Aoxie, Keninghe, and other princes, princesses, and officials also hurriedly stood up and bowed respectfully.</p><p></p><p>This sudden scene shocked Feng Changxuan and his group.</p><p></p><p>Feng Changxuan and the others couldn't help but look towards the palace gate. Who could it be that commanded such prestige?</p><p></p><p>Tap, tap, tap...</p><p></p><p>As the light and unhurried footsteps sounded, Feng Changxuan saw a handsome and transcendent young man walking in with his hands behind his back.</p><p></p><p>Behind the young man, an old man and Ye Xunwang, the Qin Saint of Cloud Lan, were following respectfully.</p><p></p><p>Who is this young man?!</p><p></p><p>Feng Changxuan stared at the figure in blue, his gaze flickering.</p><p></p><p>Keninghe couldn't help but timidly raise his head, glancing at the young man in blue out of the corner of his eye. After the incident at the Observation Pavilion, it had been a long time since he had seen him.</p><p></p><p>At this moment, the hall was deathly silent.</p><p></p><p>Cloud Zao respectfully glanced at Lu Changsheng, and without saying any formal words, he bowed and gestured: "Sir, please have a seat with me."</p><p></p><p>Lu Changsheng did not look sideways, slightly nodded his head, and then, surrounded by many gazes, he strode through the great hall and sat down in the empty seat on the left.</p><p></p><p>The moment Lu Changsheng sat down, the palace music cautiously began to sound again in the hall.</p>

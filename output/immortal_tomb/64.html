        <h1>Chapter 64</h1>
        <div class="content">
            <p>Here is the full English translation of the Chinese excerpt:</p><p></p><p>The old turtle looked at the stunned master and disciples with a smile, then turned to look at Luchengsheng, who was expressionlessly eating jujubes, and bowed, "Master, it's done. 🍪🐟❻➈丂𝐡𝐮𝓧.Ⓒ𝓸𝔪🎄🐤"</p><p></p><p>Luchengsheng nodded, then held the jujubes and walked towards the villagers while eating.</p><p></p><p>The old turtle was taken aback, then called out to the still dazed Guchelin and his disciples to follow.</p><p></p><p>Hearing the steady footsteps, the villagers' hearts trembled, and they unanimously looked up, their pupils contracting as they saw the gentleman in blue robes approaching them.</p><p></p><p>Their heartbeats grew faster and faster.</p><p></p><p>Soon, Luchengsheng stopped in front of them, and kneeling before him were Chen Dadao and the others.</p><p></p><p>Luchengsheng tilted his head and spat out a jujube seed, then swept his gaze across the villagers, smiling gently, "I've been in this Moyu Town for eight years now, and I'm sure some of you are quite familiar with me?"</p><p></p><p>His lips curled in a smile, his voice light and airy, as if he was just making casual conversation with the villagers.</p><p></p><p>Hearing this, some villagers who had greeted Luchengsheng before had wry smiles on their faces, but dared not say more.</p><p></p><p>"I believe many of you have already guessed, that's right, over the past eight years, most of the demonic troubles in Moyu Town have been secretly resolved by me," Luchengsheng said softly.</p><p></p><p>The villagers' bodies trembled, and they clenched their teeth, pressing their bodies even lower.</p><p></p><p>"Master," the old turtle came to Luchengsheng's back and conjured a chair with a flip of his hand.</p><p></p><p>Luchengsheng glanced at the old turtle and nodded, slowly sitting down.</p><p></p><p>He continued to smile and said, "So the previous talk, the previous words, were they not about me?"</p><p></p><p>Hearing this, some of the villagers' faces changed, and their bodies were terrified to the point of stiffness. Their throats felt uncomfortable, as if something was blocking them! Some villagers were even so scared that they wet their pants.</p><p></p><p>Even Chen Dadao's pupils contracted.</p><p></p><p>Could it be that the gentleman wants to settle accounts with those villagers?</p><p></p><p>"Don't be afraid, it's only human nature, I naturally won't hold it against you," Luchengsheng swept his gaze across the crowd, speaking warmly and smilingly.</p><p></p><p>Just as those villagers felt greatly relieved and their sense of shame grew, Luchengsheng suddenly stood up, clasping his hands behind his back, and as he turned to leave, he said, "But in the future, you all must be careful of the demonic troubles, for I have stayed in this Moyu Town long enough."</p><p></p><p>Guchelin and his disciples hurriedly followed behind Luchengsheng as he left.</p><p></p><p>Along the way, Tongxin and Lin Dong secretly collected the demonic cores scattered on the ground, their eyes gleaming brightly, inwardly exclaiming that they had hit the jackpot.</p><p></p><p>"Mister... ," Chen Dadao's pupils trembled as he watched Luchengsheng's retreating figure, a sense of reluctance welling up in his heart.</p><p></p><p>Eight years, and the mister is leaving again...</p><p></p><p>The villagers also remained dumbfounded, only slowly regaining their senses, and soon their hearts were filled with fear.</p><p></p><p>The mister has left, and if demonic troubles occur in the future, what are they to do...</p><p></p><p>"Hehe..." The old turtle, who had not yet left, swept his gaze across the villagers with disdain.</p><p></p><p>"Old Turtle tells you little ants, the master has roamed the heavens and earth, and has stayed in your small Moyu Town for eight years, already helping you greatly, which is your greatest honor! The master is right, human selfishness and self-interest are all part of human nature, but in times of crisis, some chilling words are best kept in the heart and not spoken out loud."</p><p></p><p>Hearing this, many villagers sobbed, "Immortal, we know we were wrong!"</p><p></p><p>"Let the mister come back, we will erect a statue to worship him forever!"</p><p></p><p>"Yes, we will never have any more doubts, woo woo."</p><p></p><p>The old turtle's face was impatient as he shouted, "Shut up!"</p><p></p><p>New 69 Book Bar → 69𝓈𝒽𝓊𝓍.𝒸ℴ𝓂</p><p></p><p>Here is the full English translation of the Chinese excerpt:</p><p></p><p>Suddenly, it became quiet.</p><p></p><p>"This is simply ridiculous! You insignificant insects, do you really think the Master would be disheartened by your words? How could someone of his stature be affected by the likes of you?"</p><p></p><p>"Grandpa Turtle is talking about that white-haired old man, Ancient Crane Forest! Do you know how difficult his cultivation is? Yet he is willing to sacrifice his life for you insignificant insects. It is your hearts that have grown cold towards him! If it were up to your Grandpa Turtle, even a small Nascent Soul cultivator would be worth more than all of your lives combined."</p><p></p><p>"If this were me, Grandpa Turtle, who would still be killing demons? I would have killed some of you first."</p><p></p><p>"As for the Master, you all should not be so greedy and delusional. The Master cannot possibly stay in one place for long... Hehe, you insignificant insects, take care of yourselves."</p><p></p><p>After the old turtle coldly laughed and said this, he glanced at the distraught Chen Dadao, tossed a small bottle into his embrace, and then disappeared in a flash.</p><p></p><p>Outside Moyu Town, it fell silent.</p><p></p><p>The old turtle's words had left the crowd dumbfounded for a long time.</p><p></p><p>"Town Master..." The steward supported Chen Dadao as he slowly stood up.</p><p></p><p>The image of the man in blue flashed through Chen Dadao's mind. He covered the object in his embrace and turned to sweep his gaze across the silent townspeople, saying expressionlessly:</p><p></p><p>"Eight years ago, when the Qian Family of Moyu Town was plagued by demons, I went to request the assistance of the Gentleman. The Gentleman gave me two choices: one, I could cultivate immortality; two, the Gentleman would subdue the demons and maintain the peace of Moyu Town. I chose the second option."</p><p></p><p>"If given another chance, I would choose to cultivate immortality."</p><p></p><p>Chen Dadao took a deep breath and said dejectedly, "Effective immediately, I will request to resign from my position as the Town Master of Moyu Town."</p><p></p><p>With the steward's support, he slowly walked towards the Town Master's residence.</p><p></p><p>The townspeople were stunned, their hearts tightening. Many had regretful expressions on their faces.</p><p></p><p>No wonder there were no more casualties in Moyu Town after that incident with the Qian Family. Even that Gentleman's intervention was at the request of the Town Master...</p><p></p><p>...</p><p></p><p>In the Demon Realm.</p><p></p><p>"No, no, this is bad!! The soul lamp of the Abyss Demon King has been extinguished! The soul lamp of the Abyss Demon King has been extinguished!!"</p><p></p><p>The demon guard trembling transmitted the message.</p><p></p><p>"What?!"</p><p></p><p>Chu Qingcang and the other three Demon Kings suddenly paused, their faces filled with disbelief, and they disappeared from their respective residences.</p><p></p><p>At this moment, Yiwo also happened to return to the Demon Realm.</p><p></p><p>She thought of the man in blue and felt a sense of powerlessness. Most importantly, she could not fathom his intentions.</p><p></p><p>And then there was the matter of her severed arm... It could not be reattached.</p><p></p><p>There seemed to be a mysterious force lingering around the stump, and no matter what she tried, she could not dispel it in the slightest...</p><p></p><p>She knew that the one who could untie this knot was the one who had tied it.</p><p></p><p>"Hm? The soul lamp of Zhao Shengyuan has been extinguished??" </p><p></p><p>Yiwo's brow furrowed, as if she had remembered something, and her face turned pale.</p><p></p><p>Could it be...?</p><p></p><p>The next moment, she disappeared from the spot.</p><p></p><p>...</p><p></p><p>"You two little rascals, what have you been secretly staring at your Grandpa Turtle for?"</p><p></p><p>The old turtle suddenly turned his head, baring his teeth menacingly.</p><p></p><p>This startled the innocent Lin Dong, who quickly hid behind Ancient Crane Forest.</p><p></p><p>Ancient Crane Forest first gave the old turtle an apologetic smile, then turned and sternly shouted, "Outrageous!!"</p><p></p><p>Tong Xin and Lin Dong immediately admitted their mistake and looked at the old turtle pitifully.</p><p></p><p>The old turtle just snorted and ignored them, as he naturally wouldn't hold a grudge.</p><p></p><p>It was just a bit of play.</p><p></p><p>Ancient Crane Forest gave an embarrassed smile, then looked at the figure in blue walking silently ahead and asked respectfully and expectantly, "Sir, would you like to visit our Qingyan Sect?"</p><p></p><p>Lu Changsheng paused in his steps and replied with a faint smile, "Okay."</p>

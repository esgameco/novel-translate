        <h1>Chapter 352</h1>
        <div class="content">
            <p>Here is the full English translation of the Chinese excerpt:</p><p></p><p>L√º Changsheng?</p><p></p><p>This name has never been heard before. Does the City of Man have such a powerful figure on the battle ranking?</p><p></p><p>But soon, someone recalled something...</p><p></p><p>Two months ago, when the Mighty King of the Golden Wheel appeared outside the Immortal Willow Tavern!</p><p></p><p>Could it be that the "Little Friend L√º" mentioned by the Mighty King of the Golden Wheel at that time was this L√º Changsheng?</p><p></p><p>Whew!</p><p></p><p>At the same time, even the top 30 Shen Xuan realm experts on the battle ranking were stunned. üíùüòéÔºñ‚ûàs·ïºÔºµ–ñ.ƒåœÉ‡πì‚úãüëΩ</p><p></p><p>Who is this L√º Changsheng? He actually took Zhao Di's spot?</p><p></p><p>It was Miu Fan and Kong Zhen who finally understood, recalling the azure-robed cultivator from two months ago.</p><p></p><p>...</p><p></p><p>In a building in the City of Man.</p><p></p><p>Bang!</p><p></p><p>Zhao Di slammed his fist on the table, shattering it, his face full of resentment, muttering, "Why... I, Zhao Di, have worked hard in cultivation, entered the top three of the battle ranking, wasn't it all for the spot in the Seven-colored Jade Tower?"</p><p></p><p>Beside him, the two young men sitting calmly, Mo Liang Qiu and Shui Ting Hen, the first and second on the battle ranking, exchanged a glance and shook their heads helplessly.</p><p></p><p>When the announcement from the Imperial Palace was made today, they were also taken aback, and then came over to Zhao Di.</p><p></p><p>"Zhao Di, the selection for the Seven-colored Jade Tower was decided by the Mighty King of the Golden Wheel and the Venerable of the Cudgel, this..."</p><p></p><p>Shui Ting Hen looked at Zhao Di, his tone a bit hesitant.</p><p></p><p>Mo Liang Qiu nodded slightly upon hearing this. He naturally knew what Shui Ting Hen meant.</p><p></p><p>The implication was that the decision of the Mighty King of the Golden Wheel and the Venerable of the Cudgel could not be defied.</p><p></p><p>But at this moment, Zhao Di seemed to be unwilling to listen, saying with difficulty, "Liang Qiu, Ting Hen, I understand your meaning, but... I've worked so hard, I'm not satisfied."</p><p></p><p>"Sigh." Mo Liang Qiu and Shui Ting Hen shook their heads.</p><p></p><p>Then Shui Ting Hen asked, "So what can you do? You can't go against the will of the two lords, can you? That would be a capital offense!"</p><p></p><p>His tone was full of a warning.</p><p></p><p>Zhao Di clenched his fist, suddenly stood up, gritted his teeth and said, "Of course I don't dare to defy the lords' will, but this L√º Changsheng, I've never even heard of him before, I'm not satisfied!"</p><p></p><p>If this person was stronger than him, he naturally wouldn't say anything, but the problem was that he had never heard of him before... That's just not acceptable!</p><p></p><p>"Two months ago, when the Mighty King of the Golden Wheel appeared in the city at the Immortal Willow Tavern and addressed a cultivator as 'Little Friend L√º', do you still remember that? The news was all over the city at that time," Mo Liang Qiu suddenly spoke up.</p><p></p><p>Shui Ting Hen was about to say something, but Zhao Di suddenly slapped his hand and exclaimed, "That's right, that's right, this L√º Changsheng must be the 'Little Friend L√º' that the Mighty King of the Golden Wheel mentioned two months ago. Who else could it be?"</p><p></p><p>Shui Ting Hen's brow furrowed slightly. The Mighty King of the Golden Wheel addressing a cultivator as "Little Friend L√º" was indeed quite unusual.</p><p></p><p>What status and position does the Mighty King of the Golden Wheel have?</p><p></p><p>Where did this L√º Changsheng come from, as if he just appeared out of nowhere!</p><p></p><p>In the past, the human race had never heard of him at all!</p><p></p><p>"The Immortal Willow Tavern... very good!" </p><p></p><p>At this moment, Zhao Di muttered, and suddenly disappeared!</p><p></p><p>"Oh no! Zhao Di has gone to find that L√º Changsheng!"</p><p></p><p>Seeing this, Mo Liang Qiu and Shui Ting Hen hurriedly chased after him.</p><p></p><p>They couldn't let Zhao Di do something foolish!</p><p></p><p>That L√º Changsheng, being addressed as "Little Friend L√º" by the Mighty King of the Golden Wheel, just thinking about it, one could tell he was no ordinary person!</p><p></p><p>Moreover, the selection for the Seven-colored Jade Tower in the City of Man was not decided by the Mighty King of the Golden Wheel alone.</p><p></p><p>New 69</p><p></p><p>Here is the full English translation of the Chinese excerpt:</p><p></p><p>That Lu Changsheng could replace Zhao Di, it shows that the Stick Saint also agreed to it.</p><p></p><p>And participating in the Seven-Colored Glazed Pagoda is for the sake of humanity. If the two human lords can push Lu Changsheng up to replace Zhao Di, it indirectly indicates that he is more capable than Zhao Di.</p><p></p><p>They need to restrain the irrational Zhao Di a bit, offending that Lu Changsheng is not too big of a problem, but going against the decision of the two human lords would be extremely unwise.</p><p></p><p>...</p><p></p><p>At the same time, in the main palace.</p><p></p><p>"That little brat Zhao Di has indeed gone to find Lu Changsheng," Yan Jueyi said indifferently.</p><p></p><p>Han Jinlong's face showed a smile: "Stick Saint, how about we make a bet?"</p><p></p><p>Yan Jueyi's brow furrowed, "Bet on what? Who wins and who loses?"</p><p></p><p>"No." Han Jinlong shook his head, then said, "We bet on how many moves it will take for Little Friend Lu to defeat Zhao Di."</p><p></p><p>Yan Jueyi was stunned, looking at Han Jinlong, and said inexplicably, "After all, Zhao Di is ranked third on the City Battle Ranking, with late-stage Shenxuan Realm cultivation, and his combat power is also among the forefront of the entire human race. Do you have such confidence in that Lu Changsheng?"</p><p></p><p>It should be known that only those in the Shenxuan Realm can participate in the Seven-Colored Glazed Pagoda, and the fact that this Lu Changsheng can participate means that his cultivation has reached the peak of the Shenxuan Realm.</p><p></p><p>But can he really defeat the late-stage Shenxuan Realm Zhao Di in just a few moves?</p><p></p><p>It feels a bit unrealistic.</p><p></p><p>Among the top ten on the City Battle Ranking, not to mention Mo Liangqiu and Shui Tinghen, even the fourth, fifth, and sixth after Zhao Di are all in the late-stage Shenxuan Realm!</p><p></p><p>Yet Zhao Di can steadily occupy the third place, which is enough to show that Zhao Di's strength among his peers is relatively strong!</p><p></p><p>Han Jinlong chuckled leisurely, "Don't worry about whether this king has confidence in Little Friend Lu or not, just tell me if you want to bet or not."</p><p></p><p>"Hmph, since you want to bet, this Saint won't be a coward, will I?" Yan Jueyi sneered coldly.</p><p></p><p>"What's the prize?" </p><p></p><p>"You decide."</p><p></p><p>"Then let it be this way, if this king wins, you can never spar with this king again!!"</p><p></p><p>"You're ruthless... What if you lose?"</p><p></p><p>"If I lose, not only every year or every few years, but this king will spare time to spar with you every month, how about that?"</p><p></p><p>"Good! This is what you said."</p><p></p><p>"This king bets that Little Friend Lu will defeat Zhao Di in more than three moves but less than six!"</p><p></p><p>Han Jinlong said with a scheming smile.</p><p></p><p>Hearing this, Yan Jueyi's eyes flickered. Does that Lu Changsheng really have such strength?</p><p></p><p>Han Jinlong's demeanor doesn't seem to be faking it...</p><p></p><p>And this guy is the one who hates sparring with him the most, but today he dares to bet so big, which shows his confidence.</p><p></p><p>Han Jinlong has seen that Lu Changsheng, but he hasn't...</p><p></p><p>Yan Jueyi just realized that this bet was a bit unfair to him.</p><p></p><p>"Gold Wheel King, this Saint doesn't believe it, even if that Lu Changsheng is at the peak of the Shenxuan Realm, it would be difficult for him to defeat Zhao Di in just a few moves, right?" Yan Jueyi said.</p><p></p><p>Han Jinlong felt the gradually restless atmosphere in the city, waving his hand and urging, "Stop wasting time, hurry up and say it."</p><p></p><p>Yan Jueyi's eyes flickered, and he said in a deep voice, "Then this Saint bets that Lu Changsheng cannot defeat Zhao Di within the time of a cup of tea."</p><p></p><p>Haha, within a cup of tea?</p><p></p><p>Han Jinlong was delighted in his heart, this bet, he can be said to have already won!</p><p></p><p>If he hadn't seen Lu Changsheng before and tested him, perhaps he would also be like this Yan Jueyi, not believing that he could easily defeat Zhao Di.</p><p></p><p>But the problem is, he has seen him and tested him!</p><p></p><p>At that time, Lu Changsheng was able to withstand the aura he released, which was enough to prove it.</p>

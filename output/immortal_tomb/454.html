        <h1>Chapter 454</h1>
        <div class="content">
            <p>Here is the full English translation of the Chinese excerpt:</p><p></p><p>After three rounds of wine, the full moon had risen high in the night sky.</p><p></p><p>Under the meaningful glances of Ye Chuiyue and Ye Chuixing, Ye Nantian approached Lu Changsheng, holding a wine cup.</p><p></p><p>As the clan leader, it was natural for Ye Nantian to take care of this matter.</p><p></p><p>The elders and elite disciples present noticed Ye Nantian's movement and turned their attention to him, the scene becoming quiet for a moment.</p><p></p><p>Ye Nantian took a light breath and said in a solemn voice:</p><p></p><p>"Senior Lu, although the Ye Clan has only recently ascended to the status of a top-tier ancient clan, we have managed to firmly establish our position among the top-tier ancient clans. We may not dare to claim to be among the foremost, but we are certainly not weak either..."</p><p></p><p>Hearing Ye Nantian's resolute words, the crowd couldn't help but feel a surge of warmth in their hearts. Indeed, the period when they had just ascended was extremely difficult, but they had persevered.</p><p></p><p>At this moment, some perceptive elders had already guessed what their clan leader was about to do. They looked at Ye Chuiyue and Ye Chuixing, and immediately understood the true purpose of tonight's banquet.</p><p></p><p>No wonder even the Patriarch and the Elder had come. In addition to this young man's cultivation and strength, the more important reason was likely because they were making a sincere offer...</p><p></p><p>Seeing that Lu Changsheng was still quietly drinking, Ye Nantian gritted his teeth and continued:</p><p></p><p>"Senior Lu, I'll be direct. The Ye Clan sincerely invites you to serve as our Offering Elder, a position of great honor. The treatment will be excellent, and you will not be constrained!"</p><p></p><p>The Offering Elder, a position among the guest elders! </p><p></p><p>Hiss!</p><p></p><p>This position could be said to be considerably high, even slightly higher than Ye Nantian, the clan leader himself!</p><p></p><p>Ye Chuiyue and Ye Chuixing exchanged an unexpected glance. They had thought Ye Nantian was only inviting this Lu friend to be an ordinary guest elder, but they never expected it to be the exalted position of Offering Elder.</p><p></p><p>Ye Chuiyue couldn't help but look at Ye Nantian with newfound respect, feeling somewhat satisfied in his heart.</p><p></p><p>Imagine, within the Ye Clan, a figure would appear who outranked even Ye Nantian, the clan leader, and this person was personally recruited by Ye Nantian. This showed an incredible vision and magnanimity.</p><p></p><p>"Now this is more like a clan leader," Ye Chuiyue thought to himself.</p><p></p><p>Clunk.</p><p></p><p>Lu Changsheng put down his wine cup, his gaze sweeping across the many watchful eyes. Those his gaze fell upon immediately lowered their heads, not daring to meet his eyes.</p><p></p><p>Lu Changsheng smiled slightly. "I may not be able to stay in the Hollow Celestial Realm for long."</p><p></p><p>Ye Nantian hurriedly said, "Senior Lu, you misunderstand. As our Offering Elder, you will not be constrained at all. Senior Lu will still be a free man, free to go wherever you wish. Even if you leave the Mortal Realm, you will forever be the Offering Elder of our Ye Clan!"</p><p></p><p>Lu Changsheng nodded slightly, his gaze turning to the somewhat expectant Ye Chuiyue and Ye Chuixing, and he said softly, "In that case, I don't mind taking on this honorary position."</p><p></p><p>It was truly a case of "asking for a short hand and getting a long arm." The Ye Clan's performance was impeccable.</p><p></p><p>Ye Nantian was immediately overjoyed, quickly looking to Ye Chuiyue and Ye Chuixing.</p><p></p><p>"Haha, good!" Ye Chuiyue came over and smiled, "Nantian, immediately go make arrangements for the upcoming grand ceremony, then go invite the friendly ancient clans!"</p><p></p><p>But before Ye Nantian could respond, Lu Changsheng waved his hand and smiled, "The grand ceremony is not necessary."</p><p></p><p>Ye Nantian looked at Ye Chuiyue with some difficulty, "Patriarch, Lu Senior..."</p><p></p><p>Ye Chuiyue pursed his lips, speaking solemnly, "Daoist friend Lu, in order to express our Ye Clan's importance to you, the grand ceremony is a must! After all, this matter of you becoming the Offering Elder is such a big event, it wouldn't be right not to hold a grand ceremony..."</p><p></p><p>By the end, Ye Chuiyue's tone had become somewhat helpless.</p><p></p><p>Here is the full English translation of the Chinese excerpt:</p><p></p><p>"There is no need for that, I have already felt the sincerity of the Ye Clan," Lü Changsheng said again.</p><p></p><p>Seeing Lü Changsheng's insistence, Ye Zhuiyue also did not know what else to say, and then looked at Ye Nantian and said:</p><p></p><p>"Nantian, since Elder Lü has said so, then there is no need to hold a grand ceremony. Just inform the other ancient clans of this matter."</p><p></p><p>"Yes, Venerable Ancestor," Ye Nantian respectfully responded.</p><p></p><p>Ye Zhuiyue glanced at Lü Changsheng and then swept his gaze across the elders and the younger members of the Ye Clan, his stern voice resounding throughout the Ye Clan:</p><p></p><p>"From today onwards, Dao Friend Lü shall be the Offering Elder of our Ye Clan. Any member of the Ye Clan who sees him shall treat him as they would the Venerable Ancestor himself. If there is anyone disrespectful, the clan law will be upheld!!"</p><p></p><p>It was the voice of the Venerable Ancestor!</p><p></p><p>The Ye Clan was shaken. They had actually appointed a Offering Elder of such an exalted status?</p><p></p><p>Who was he?</p><p></p><p>Just as the younger members of the Ye Clan were puzzled and bewildered, Ye Zhuiyue's gaze sharpened, and his aura erupted as he used a technique to project the scene of the banquet into the minds of every younger member of the Ye Clan!</p><p></p><p>After the initial shock, the younger members of the Ye Clan finally saw through the mental image the scene of the banquet, and the young man in azure robes who was the center of attention.</p><p></p><p>This young man was their new Offering Elder of the Ye Clan...</p><p></p><p>Many of the younger members of the Ye Clan exclaimed in shock, for this was the same stranger they had encountered in the Cangwu Pavilion that day.</p><p></p><p>In less than a day, he had become their Offering Elder. Fortunately, they had not offended him at the Cangwu Pavilion, and the younger members of the Ye Clan felt a sense of relief and gratitude.</p><p></p><p>...</p><p></p><p>At the banquet.</p><p></p><p>Ye Xunwang looked at the scene before him, bewildered. He had originally come with the elders on some private matter, but in less than a day, this man had become the Offering Elder of their Ye Clan... truly...</p><p></p><p>At the same time, Ye Xunwang looked deeply at Ye Zhuiyue and the others who were now politely conversing with Lü Changsheng.</p><p></p><p>Ye Xunwang believed that in due time, the Venerable Ancestor and the elders would be grateful for today's actions.</p><p></p><p>Ye Xunwang had a strange intuition that all along, he had only seen the tip of the iceberg of this seemingly calm and indifferent young man in azure robes...</p><p></p><p>Although this intuition seemed absurd, who could say for sure?</p><p></p><p>"Hehe, Elder Lü, how about we set aside a special space in the clan for you as your Offering Hall?" Ye Zhuiyue stroked his beard and smiled.</p><p></p><p>Lü Changsheng waved his hand: "No need to trouble yourself, I'm not that particular about living arrangements. The previous courtyard will do just fine."</p><p></p><p>"Alright then!" Ye Zhuiyue looked at Ye Nantian and said solemnly, "Nantian, the courtyard Lü Elder previously resided in shall be designated as the Offering Hall. Without Lü Elder's consent, no one, including this Venerable Ancestor, is allowed to approach it!"</p><p></p><p>"Uh, yes, Venerable Ancestor!" Ye Nantian quickly acknowledged.</p><p></p><p>The others also broke out in cold sweat, the Venerable Ancestor was truly valuing the Offering Elder greatly, to the point that even the Venerable Ancestor himself could not approach his residence. This was truly impressive.</p><p></p><p>"Then I shall take my leave, I'm a bit tired," Lü Changsheng said as he stood up.</p><p></p><p>"Nantian!" Ye Zhuiyue gave Ye Nantian a meaningful look.</p><p></p><p>"Ah yes, Lü Elder, the clan leader will see you off," Ye Nantian quickly said.</p><p></p><p>Lü Changsheng smiled wryly: "Clan Leader, let Ye Feng lead the way."</p><p></p><p>Ye Nantian hurriedly looked around: "Ye Feng, where is that boy?"</p><p></p><p>"Here, here, here!" Ye Feng quickly stepped forward and bowed.</p>

        <h1>Chapter 218</h1>
        <div class="content">
            <p>Here is the full English translation of the Chinese excerpt:</p><p></p><p>"Hmph, the three Immortal Emperors will be dealt with by this Elder. The rest of the Immortal Venerable Ones are for you four to handle..." Peng Fang said indifferently.</p><p></p><p>"Elder, don't worry, the four of us are more than enough to handle them," Left Qianshen said solemnly with a cupped fist salute.</p><p></p><p>Su Qianghe, Yin Jiukui, and Zhao Wuyou successively nodded, their eyes filled with a bloodthirsty gaze.</p><p></p><p>"Good, then..." Peng Fang narrowed his eyes, his robe moving without wind, and his figure suddenly vanished. "Go with this Elder to tear them apart!!"</p><p></p><p>Hearing this, the fists of Left Qianshen's group clenched tightly, and they one after another burst forth with a bang!</p><p></p><p>Seeing this, Zhong Wuyan's heart tightened, and he let out a loud roar: "So be it! This Elder wants to see for himself how these Nine Revolving Immortal Emperors are different!"</p><p></p><p>"Elders, attack!!"</p><p></p><p>Upon hearing this, the other Elders immediately nodded, their expressions grave, completely different from their initial disdain.</p><p></p><p>They abruptly stepped forward!</p><p></p><p>Only Zhong Wuyan, Zhao Shen, and the three Elders remained in place, for they had already been firmly locked onto by the aura of the Nine Revolving Immortal Emperors.</p><p></p><p>Zhong Wuyan's eyes flickered as he said solemnly, "Fellow Elders, let's attack together!"</p><p></p><p>Zhao Shen and the other two Elders nodded.</p><p></p><p>Immediately after, the three of them, as if in tacit agreement, began to gesture with their hands. In an instant, the sky above the Sunset Thunder Forest was filled with violently churning dark clouds, and lightning flashed!</p><p></p><p>Rumble—!!</p><p></p><p>Roar—</p><p></p><p>Afterwards, the crowd was stunned to see that the countless lightning bolts within the dark clouds had converged into a massive thunder dragon, thousands of feet long, weaving through the sea of clouds, its dragon roar echoing.</p><p></p><p>Lu Ye swept his gaze across the chaotic crowd, then looked up at the thunder dragon in the sea of clouds and sighed with a smile, "Thunder Sect Master, your Great Sun Thunder Sect is unparalleled in the Way of Thunder Manipulation in the entire Linglang Heavens."</p><p></p><p>"That's right, in the Way of Thunder, the Great Sun Thunder Sect indeed has its unique strengths," Li Tailing also nodded in agreement.</p><p></p><p>The Elders and senior members of the various sects behind them also hurriedly nodded in affirmation.</p><p></p><p>"Hehe," Lei Chengdong seemed quite pleased, shaking his head with a smile: "Sect Master Lu and Pavilion Master Li have praised us too highly. Each sect has its own strengths. If it's about Fire Manipulation, who can match the Mysterious Fire Sect?"</p><p></p><p>"And if it's about Sword Manipulation, who can match Pavilion Master Li's Heaven Sword Pavilion?"</p><p></p><p>Hearing this, Lu Ye and Li Tailing exchanged a smile.</p><p></p><p>Roar!!!</p><p></p><p>At this moment, the thousand-foot thunder dragon surged out of the sea of clouds, charging towards Peng Fang!</p><p></p><p>The hearts of the crowd were filled with dread. If this thousand-foot thunder dragon were to fall on them, they would likely be decimated in an instant!</p><p></p><p>Fortunately, the Violet Gold Space provided a barrier.</p><p></p><p>"Hehe, it seems you still don't understand what it means to be a Nine Revolving Immortal Emperor... With just one Eight Revolving and two Five Revolving, how do you plan to contend with us?" Peng Fang said disdainfully, then looked up at the thunder dragon, and two stone axes suddenly appeared in his hands!</p><p></p><p>He then gave a slight shake of his hands, and the stone axes began to tremble, with crimson patterns spreading across them, and a blood-red glow flashing, looking extremely ominous.</p><p></p><p>What kind of weapon is this?</p><p></p><p>The crowd was slightly startled, carefully examining the stone axes in Peng Fang's hands, having never seen or heard of such a thing before.</p><p></p><p>The main thing was that they could sense a strong aura of evil from it...</p><p></p><p>Even though they were separated by the Violet Gold Space, the crowd still felt a chill in their hearts.</p><p></p><p>Could it be that this Carefree Sect is practicing the path of evil cultivation?</p><p></p><p>Lei Chengdong, Lu Ye, and Li Tailing exchanged a glance, all seeing confusion and solemnity in each other's eyes.</p><p></p><p>These stone axes are strange!</p><p></p><p>Just then, Peng Fang crossed the two axes in front of him, and the axes began to tremble violently, as if struggling to be contained.</p><p></p><p>The next moment, the two axes crossed and slashed down!!</p><p></p><p>"Demonic Spirit—Soul Sea Technique!"</p><p></p><p>A moment of silence!</p><p></p><p>Towering red radiance erupted from the two axes like a tidal wave!!!</p><p></p><p>Accompanied by a heart-rending screech, as if it wanted to tear apart one's soul.</p><p></p><p>Here is the full English translation of the Chinese excerpt:</p><p></p><p>Eardrum!!</p><p></p><p>The moment the evil red glow erupted, the thousand-fathom Thunder Dragon was instantly shattered and dispersed!!</p><p></p><p>The crowd was horrified and aghast!!</p><p></p><p>Even the three Sect Masters of the First-Rate Sects, including Lei Cheng Dong, abruptly stood up from their seats!! Their eyes were fixed intently on the evil red glow!!</p><p></p><p>At the same time, there was a hint of urgency in Lei Cheng Dong's eyes!!</p><p></p><p>This strike clearly exceeded the limits of the Immortal Emperor Realm!!</p><p></p><p>Zhong Wu Yan and the others might not be able to withstand it!!</p><p></p><p>This Xiao Yao Sect...</p><p></p><p>At this moment,</p><p></p><p>affected by the battle on the Elder's Battlefield, the pace of the battles between the Stewards, Protectors, and disciples had unconsciously slowed down... their focus had shifted to the First Battlefield.</p><p></p><p>The Grand Elder of the Xiao Yao Sect is terrifyingly powerful!</p><p></p><p>Is this really not the Sect Master?!!</p><p></p><p>Left Chou Shan and the others also slowed down their pace, unable to help but swallow hard...</p><p></p><p>The Grand Elder is truly formidable!</p><p></p><p>It seems that their attempt to expose the Grand Elder's secret stash of fine wine the other day was a bit reckless.</p><p></p><p>They had indeed been recklessly wandering around the gates of the underworld without any fear or caution.</p><p></p><p>.........</p><p></p><p>In the First Battlefield, Zhong Wu Yan and the others were completely dumbfounded!!</p><p></p><p>The Thunder Dragon they had combined their efforts to unleash was actually, actually shattered in an instant??</p><p></p><p>How was this possible!</p><p></p><p>They regained their senses, their faces ashen as they stared at the towering red glow, its eerie and powerful presence making their breathing extremely rapid!!</p><p></p><p>This strike, they might not be able to withstand it!!!</p><p></p><p>The Grand Elder of the Xiao Yao Sect, so powerful?</p><p></p><p>"Let's go all out!! Senior Elders, form the Heaven Thunder Shield!"</p><p></p><p>Zhong Wu Yan roared, rapidly forming hand seals.</p><p></p><p>Zhao Shen and the Third Elder heard the call, and began forming seals as well, but the red glow in front of them was getting closer, exerting an immense pressure on them.</p><p></p><p>Rumbling...</p><p></p><p>Crack!!</p><p></p><p>Countless arcs of lightning fell from the sky like a torrential downpour, quickly connecting around Zhong Wu Yan and the others.</p><p></p><p>Soon, they were completely enveloped in a 360-degree web of lightning arcs.</p><p></p><p>Sizzle—!</p><p></p><p>Everyone's eyes were almost blinded by the dazzling light.</p><p></p><p>"Trying to stop a chariot with your bare arms!" Peng Fang sneered.</p><p></p><p>He had already put away his twin axes, and was now standing there leisurely with a big belly, watching with great confidence.</p><p></p><p>Boom!</p><p></p><p>The next moment, the towering red glow suddenly descended upon Zhong Wu Yan and the others' Heaven Thunder Shield.</p><p></p><p>Time seemed to freeze for an instant... Boom!!</p><p></p><p>The lightning arcs, unable to withstand the impact, suddenly dissipated. Taking advantage of this gap, the red glow fiercely enveloped and entangled Zhong Wu Yan and the others!!</p><p></p><p>Within the red glow, countless skeletal spirit bodies materialized, frantically tearing and biting at Zhong Wu Yan and the others!!</p><p></p><p>"Ahhhhh—!"</p><p></p><p>Immediately, heart-wrenching screams echoed through the void.</p><p></p><p>The cultivators' eyes were filled with horror and a chill ran down their spines.</p><p></p><p>How ruthless, how evil!</p><p></p><p>What is this...?</p><p></p><p>"Audacious!!!" </p><p></p><p>Lei Cheng Dong's eyelids twitched, and he shouted in alarm.</p><p></p><p>But Peng Fang seemed unperturbed, merely glancing at Lei Cheng Dong before turning his attention back to appreciating his own handiwork...</p><p></p><p>At this moment, Zhong Wu Yan and the others had been torn to a horrifying state, barely clinging to life.</p><p></p><p>Yet this red glow showed no signs of abating, seemingly intent on tearing them apart completely... How cruel.</p><p></p><p>Everyone watched with icy hearts.</p><p></p><p>Their fear and dread towards the Xiao Yao Sect had risen several levels!</p><p></p><p>Lei Cheng Dong now regretted not having entered the Purple Gold Space earlier.</p><p></p><p>However... he could not just watch as the three most important Elders of the Great Day Thunder Sect were killed!!</p><p></p><p>He looked up at the elder's illusory figure in the sky and solemnly commanded:</p><p></p><p>"Sect Master Wei, please allow our Sect to enter the battlefield!"</p><p></p><p>At these words, the crowd drew in a sharp breath of cold air!!</p><p></p><p>What is the Great Day Thunder Sect planning to do?</p><p></p><p>Could it be that they want to break the rules?</p>

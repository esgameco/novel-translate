        <h1>Chapter 279</h1>
        <div class="content">
            <p>Here is the full English translation of the Chinese excerpt:</p><p></p><p>The onlooking crowd was shocked. üç¨‚ò†‚ûÖÔºôùî∞‚íΩùî≤Ôº∏.ùïî·ªñÁà™üêü‚ô†</p><p></p><p>No one had expected that the Liu Clan, who seemed to have a good relationship with the Ouyang Clan, would actually make such a surprising move.</p><p></p><p>They had figured it out - the ambition and appetite of the Liu Clan were not small at all...</p><p></p><p>In the sky above the Fu Clan.</p><p></p><p>Xu Chong and Gao Teng were stunned, and when they regained their senses, they looked at the gloomy-faced Ouyang Nuo with a somewhat puzzled expression.</p><p></p><p>"Hehe, the Ouyang Clan Leader's expression doesn't seem very good..."</p><p></p><p>At this moment, Fu Liancai mockingly looked at Ouyang Nuo and said with a smile.</p><p></p><p>Ouyang Nuo stared intently at Fu Liancai and gritted his teeth, saying, "Fu Liancai, you're lucky today..."</p><p></p><p>He then shouted down towards the battlefield below, "Hui Clan!!"</p><p></p><p>Just then,</p><p></p><p>However, Fu Liancai blocked Ouyang Nuo's path, and in the midst of his gloomy gaze, he sneered, "Ouyang Nuo, do you think my Fu Clan can come and go as they please?"</p><p></p><p>He knew that even if the Ouyang Clan left, it would be useless, as his Fu Clan could not hide from the Ouyang Clan forever, and would ultimately be left to struggle for survival. It might as well...</p><p></p><p>Seeing this, Xu Chong and Gao Teng were dumbfounded, and they quickly understood Fu Liancai's intentions.</p><p></p><p>"Fu Liancai, are you so eager for your Fu Clan to be destroyed??"</p><p></p><p>Ouyang Nuo's eyes were tinged with a layer of bloodiness, revealing how chaotic his state of mind was at the moment.</p><p></p><p>"Hehe, Ouyang Nuo, I really didn't expect Liu Qing's move, but since his ambition is so great, why don't I help him this time? Although my Fu Clan will be destroyed, you Ouyang Clan will definitely not fare well either! At most, we'll go down together..."</p><p></p><p>Fu Liancai let out a sinister laugh.</p><p></p><p>"Go down together? You're overestimating yourself. My Ouyang Clan's ancestor is still in seclusion, do you think Liu Qing and the Liu Clan's ancestor can defeat us so easily?" Ouyang Nuo paused, sneering constantly, but his heart was actually in a state of panic.</p><p></p><p>Because the Ouyang Clan's ancestor was still in seclusion...</p><p></p><p>"Since you're so eager to seek death... then I'll grant your wish!!"</p><p></p><p>Ouyang Nuo no longer had the patience to exchange words with Fu Liancai. Since Fu Liancai was unwilling to let him leave, then he would destroy Fu Liancai!</p><p></p><p>Boundless divine elemental pressure erupted from his body, and his fists flashed with golden light!</p><p></p><p>"You two... follow me and destroy him quickly!" Ouyang Nuo commanded in a low voice, not looking sideways.</p><p></p><p>He was naturally speaking to Xu Chong and Gao Teng,</p><p></p><p>But Xu Chong and Gao Teng just smiled apologetically and retreated.</p><p></p><p>Ouyang Nuo's mouth twitched, of course, there was no good one among them, they were all rotten seeds!!</p><p></p><p>These Xu Chong and Gao Teng, after hearing about the Liu Clan's sneak attack on the Ouyang Clan, must have been plotting something else in their hearts!</p><p></p><p>Damn it!</p><p></p><p>At the same time, the situation on the battlefield below had already changed.</p><p></p><p>Originally, the Ouyang Clan, Liu Clan, Xu Clan, and Gao Clan had joined forces to attack the Fu Clan disciples.</p><p></p><p>But now the situation had changed, with the few Liu Clan elders and their own disciples joining hands with the Fu Clan to fight against the Ouyang Clan.</p><p></p><p>As for the people of the Xu Clan and Gao Clan, although they were still in the midst of the battle, they seemed to be playing around, no longer as fierce as before, as if they were not helping either side...</p><p></p><p>Seeing this, Ouyang Nuo's face turned ugly, and he immediately engaged in battle with Fu Liancai!</p><p></p><p>Boom! Boom! Boom!!</p><p></p><p>Bursts of explosive light effects came and went, and the ripples of the airflow spread out in waves in all directions.</p><p></p><p>The intensity of the battle between the two was the greatest in this area.</p><p></p><p>Ouyang Nuo was in a hurry at the moment, so his attacks were extremely sharp. He didn't dare to drag it out, because if this continued, the Ouyang Clan might really end up in the same fate as the Fu Clan.</p><p></p><p>Here is the full English translation of the Chinese excerpt:</p><p></p><p>The Same Fate!</p><p></p><p>Initially, the two were evenly matched, but very soon, Fu Liancai began to retreat step by step under the ruthless offensive of Ouyang Nuo.</p><p></p><p>Ouyang Nuo became more and more anxious as he fought, and although Fu Liancai seemed to be suppressed by him, it was not easy to defeat or even kill him. Damn it!</p><p></p><p>At this moment, a young man carrying a sword suddenly appeared between Ouyang Nuo and Fu Liancai!</p><p></p><p>Fu Liancai was stunned, wasn't this the follower of his friend Lu?</p><p></p><p>Although he was surprised and suspicious, he still withdrew to a certain distance!</p><p></p><p>But Ouyang Nuo's face was grim, who was this little rascal, and he really didn't have much time to be delayed by him. </p><p></p><p>So his fists kept flashing with light, without any intention of holding back, but instead gathered his strength and fiercely rushed forward!</p><p></p><p>Suddenly, the sky darkened, and a magnificent illusory starry sea appeared, with countless fist energies bursting out like meteors, with the momentum to destroy the heavens and the earth!</p><p></p><p>"Shocking Mysterious Violent Gale Fist, Starry Fist Shadow!"</p><p></p><p>Li Shuyan's brows furrowed slightly, and he suddenly turned around and stared at the illusory starry sea, his left hand holding a sword and his right hand making a seal, and then he slapped forward with a mighty force!</p><p></p><p>A golden palm the size of ten thousand feet, with a mighty force, came rushing towards it!</p><p></p><p>"Overturning Heaven's Palm!"</p><p></p><p>Wow!</p><p></p><p>Everyone was stunned and looked incredulously at these two fierce attacks.</p><p></p><p>Who was this sudden powerful expert?</p><p></p><p>At this moment, the two attacks collided violently!</p><p></p><p>The ten-thousand-foot golden light palm, with a momentum that could crush and pull down, directly extinguished Ouyang Nuo's countless fist energies, and finally directly shattered the illusory starry sea!</p><p></p><p>"Cough!"</p><p></p><p>Ouyang Nuo coughed up a mouthful of fresh blood, staggering back half a step, his expression had already changed greatly, staring unbelievably at Li Shuyan!</p><p></p><p>He remembered that this person was one of the two strangers who had followed the Fu family members back to the city today!</p><p></p><p>How could he be so powerful!</p><p></p><p>Could it be that the Fu family had hired outside help? But when he saw Fu Liancai's expression, he knew it was not the case...</p><p></p><p>At this moment,</p><p></p><p>All the battles in this place had ceased, and everyone was shocked to see the injured and retreating Ouyang Nuo, and finally their gaze fell on the young man holding the sword, their eyes trembling.</p><p></p><p>When did Jingyu City produce such a top-tier expert!</p><p></p><p>And many of the Fu family members were also dumbfounded,</p><p></p><p>Especially Fu Liancai, Fu Shiyu, Fu Tao, and the elders.</p><p></p><p>After the shock, a bronze mask flashed in their minds!!</p><p></p><p>The young man holding the sword in front of them had the strength to defeat the Ouyang Clan Leader,</p><p></p><p>Then... what about that person... at the Divine Yang Realm!!</p><p></p><p>For a moment, the more they thought about it, the more terrifying it became.</p><p></p><p>"Fellow Daoist... who are you? Why did you intervene in this matter?" </p><p></p><p>Ouyang Nuo wiped the blood from the corner of his mouth and asked breathlessly.</p><p></p><p>"Rumble‚Äî!"</p><p></p><p>At this moment, a huge explosion suddenly erupted in another part of Jingyu City, and everyone looked over there in shock!</p><p></p><p>They saw a huge mushroom cloud rising in the direction of the Ouyang Clan.</p><p></p><p>The Liu Clan had already started the attack!</p><p></p><p>Immediately, the disciples of the Ouyang Clan all looked anxiously at Ouyang Nuo.</p><p></p><p>"Fellow Daoist!!! Don't interfere in today's matter! After that, the interests of the Fu Clan will give you 70%!!"</p><p></p><p>Ouyang Nuo immediately shouted urgently.</p><p></p><p>Li Shuyan waved his hand, "I'm not interested in your so-called interests, I just want to ask, why did the senior currently staying as a guest in the Fu Clan come to attack so fiercely today, and even say that not even a dog or chicken would be left?"</p><p></p><p>What senior?? </p><p></p><p>Ouyang Nuo and many onlookers were puzzled.</p><p></p><p>Only the members of the Fu Clan were startled!</p>

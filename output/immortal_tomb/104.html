        <h1>Chapter 104</h1>
        <div class="content">
            <p>Here is the full English translation of the Chinese excerpt:</p><p></p><p>Chu Lang carried a stack of luxurious wine bottles as he walked towards the courtyard where Lu Changsheng was. Two graceful beauties, who looked like twin sisters, were following behind him. </p><p></p><p>These two beauties were not the lowest-ranking servants of the Chu clan immortal tribe, but rather were of some status as illegitimate offspring.</p><p></p><p>"When we arrive at the senior's courtyard, do you know what to do?" Chu Lang asked indifferently, exuding the dignity of a clan leader.</p><p></p><p>"Clan leader, rest assured, we know what to do," the sisters said in unison.</p><p></p><p>"Oh? You already know what to do even before I, the clan leader, have told you?" Chu Lang turned around and looked at the sisters with some surprise, continuing, "Tell me, what are you going to do?"</p><p></p><p>The sisters said, "We will pounce on that senior."</p><p></p><p>Chu Lang's expression froze, his scalp went numb, and his face stiffened as he angrily shouted, "Outrageous!!"</p><p></p><p>"Clan leader, please calm down!" The sisters were frightened and knelt on the ground, somewhat at a loss.</p><p></p><p>"That senior is someone you can just pounce on? You're just a toad trying to eat a swan - a delusional fantasy!!" Chu Lang said impatiently.</p><p></p><p>That was the Primordial Immortal Lord, the Primordial Immortal Lord! How could they be qualified?</p><p></p><p>"Hmph, the ones you should try to please are not the senior, but the senior's servants. Understand?" Chu Lang said solemnly.</p><p></p><p>"Yes..." The sisters answered tremblingly. They naturally knew about that old servant, but they were somewhat unwilling in their hearts. An old geezer, how could he compare to the elegant young master in blue robes?</p><p></p><p>Chu Lang nodded in satisfaction, about to take a step forward, when a familiar voice sounded.</p><p></p><p>"Hey, Chu Lang, what's with all these big and small bottles in your hands? Where are you going?" Soon, Huang Zhong and Chen He came over, smiling.</p><p></p><p>"Greetings, Clan Leader Huang, Clan Leader Chen." The sisters hurriedly bowed in greeting.</p><p></p><p>Chu Lang raised his eyebrows and casually asked, "Oh? Is there some important occasion today that you two have come again?"</p><p></p><p>"Hehe, Chen He and I have come to pay our respects to the senior, of course. " Huang Zhong said directly, not trying to hide anything.</p><p></p><p>"Pay respects to the senior? Have you prepared the gifts to offer the senior?" Chu Lang looked the two of them up and down and asked intentionally.</p><p></p><p>He was not the least bit anxious in his heart, after all, since he had told the senior that the senior liked fine wine, he believed his preparation would surely gain the senior's approval. This way, he could stand out among the three of them!</p><p></p><p>"Of course we have brought the gifts, do you think we clan leaders lack that basic awareness? Chu Lang, just lead the way, don't worry about it," Chen He urged.</p><p></p><p>"Follow me then."</p><p></p><p>Chu Lang raised his head proudly and led the way. Huang Zhong and Chen He saw Chu Lang's confident expression, as if he had already secured their victory, and both frowned slightly.</p><p></p><p>...</p><p></p><p>The luxurious manor in front of them was truly magnificent, if one could even call it a manor - it was more like a palace! Compared to the elegant courtyard of the Qingyan Sect within the Ancient Crane Forest, this Chu clan immortal tribe's luxurious manor was nothing.</p><p></p><p>In front of the luxurious manor, Chu Lang, Huang Zhong, and Chen He stood in a line and bowed respectfully, calling out, "Senior, Chu Lang (Huang Zhong, Chen He) have come to pay our respects!"</p><p></p><p>After the words were spoken, there was no movement from the luxurious manor.</p><p></p><p>Seeing this, the group did not dare to straighten up, remaining bent over.</p><p></p><p>Huang Zhong and Chen He were starting to feel nervous, while Chu Lang, who had mistaken Lu Changsheng for the Primordial Immortal Lord, was even more distraught, with beads of cold sweat dripping from his forehead one by one...</p><p></p><p>Huh?</p><p></p><p>Huang He and Chen He's mouths twitched slightly, they really wanted to ask, "Chu Lang, are you really that anxious?"</p><p></p><p>Fourth-rank and above Grand Dao Immortals are indeed formidable, but they haven't offended the senior, so there's no need to be so afraid, right? At least he's a clan leader, how unimpressive.</p><p></p><p>The next moment, the old turtle's figure appeared before the group. He did not...</p><p></p><p>Here is the full English translation of the Chinese excerpt:</p><p></p><p>The old turtle's mouth curled up, and he smiled contentedly.</p><p></p><p>"Which clan leader has such keen insight and really understands this old turtle?"</p><p></p><p>"These two young ladies... what do they mean?" </p><p></p><p>The old turtle asked with a chuckle as he pinched his beard.</p><p></p><p>"Senior Turtle, these two are the personal attendants that Chu Lang has brought to serve you!!"</p><p></p><p>Chu Lang immediately looked up and said with a cupped fist salute.</p><p></p><p>Since the master is the Immortal Sovereign, then this old servant in front of him must be a Grand Celestial Immortal, right? Or should he show even more respect.</p><p></p><p>"Haha, what a 'personal' attendant. You've done well, Grandpa Turtle likes 'personal attendants'."</p><p></p><p>The old turtle patted Chu Lang's shoulder, satisfied.</p><p></p><p>Huang Zhong and Chen He saw this and their brows furrowed slightly. Damn, they were careless, and this guy Chu Lang had already gained the favor of the senior servant, which was not good for them!</p><p></p><p>Chu Lang noticed the gazes of Huang Zhong and the others, and inwardly chuckled, clearing his throat and looking at the old turtle. "Senior Turtle, we have come to pay our respects to you."</p><p></p><p>As he spoke, he lifted the bundle of wine jars in his hand, making a clanging sound.</p><p></p><p>The old turtle's eyes lit up. This Chu Lang really knows how to please, thoroughly understanding the master and his preferences. He then smiled and said, "Mm, the master has allowed you to go in, so go quickly."</p><p></p><p>"Yes!"</p><p></p><p>The three of them were delighted, cupping their fists and quickly entering the courtyard.</p><p></p><p>Before entering the courtyard, Chu Lang also gave a meaningful glance to the sisters.</p><p></p><p>"You two come over here..."</p><p></p><p>The old turtle waved to the sisters, his face grinning mischievously.</p><p></p><p>The sisters' hearts trembled, and they slowly walked towards the old turtle. When they were about half a zhang (approximately 5 meters) away, they stopped, "Senior..."</p><p></p><p>The old turtle raised his eyebrows slightly, mockingly saying, "What? The 'personal attendant' that your clan leader mentioned, is this how you 'personally attend'? Grandpa Turtle wants to go ask your clan leader..."</p><p></p><p>As he spoke, he turned around and made a gesture as if he was about to enter the courtyard to find Chu Lang.</p><p></p><p>"Senior!" </p><p></p><p>The sisters cried out anxiously, stopping the old turtle.</p><p></p><p>The old turtle's face broke into a smug smile as he turned around and opened his arms, "Since you're afraid Grandpa Turtle will tattle, what are you still waiting for?"</p><p></p><p>The next moment, the two soft and tender figures collided with the old turtle's chest, and he took the opportunity to embrace them one by one.</p><p></p><p>Lowering his head, he asked with a smile, "Are you truly disgusted by this old body of mine?"</p><p></p><p>The sisters were so frightened that they shook their heads repeatedly, saying they didn't dare.</p><p></p><p>The old turtle turned the sisters' faces towards him, then his appearance began to change - sometimes into a handsome young man, sometimes into a mature uncle, and sometimes into a scholarly gentleman... In just a short while, he had transformed into dozens of different styles of faces.</p><p></p><p>The sisters were completely dumbfounded...</p><p></p><p>The old turtle reverted to his original appearance and sneered, "Appearance? What's the use of that? As long as Grandpa Turtle wishes, what appearance can't I transform into? Attractive exteriors are a dime a dozen, but interesting souls are rare. So which one is more important?"</p><p></p><p>"An interesting soul," the sisters replied in a low voice.</p><p></p><p>"Hehe, it seems you two are still a bit hesitant... Don't worry, as long as you serve Grandpa Turtle well, the benefits won't be lacking. Grandpa Turtle won't force you, I just have one question - are you willing?"</p><p></p><p>As he spoke, a rare and precious spirit stone that was even uncommon in the Chu Clan appeared in his hand. He even pretended to wipe it with his sleeve, making it shine brightly.</p><p></p><p>The sisters' expressions were shocked, their eyes shining brightly!</p><p></p><p>The next moment, the sisters pulled the old turtle and quickly fled to a more secluded area.</p><p></p><p>"Senior, we really like... your interesting soul."</p>

        <h1>Chapter 271</h1>
        <div class="content">
            <p>Here is my translation of the Chinese excerpt:</p><p></p><p>Swoosh, swoosh, swoosh!</p><p></p><p>A brilliant azure sword energy burst open in the darkness. </p><p></p><p>The five Wujie Tiandao were slightly taken aback. They didn't expect the other party to act without even saying a word, to strike as soon as they said they would, without the slightest hesitation.</p><p></p><p>But the sword energy they struck out was like fine dust in this void space. </p><p></p><p>To the five Wujie Tiandao from the Middle World, it looked small and insignificant. Could it really be that powerful?</p><p></p><p>However, in the next moment,</p><p></p><p>The azure sword energy surged towards them like twinkling stars!</p><p></p><p>The might and the sharpness that seemed to tear the void was finally revealed, shocking them greatly!</p><p></p><p>They didn't have time to think, as they tried to activate their Tiandao powers, only to find that they were all constrained!</p><p></p><p>It was as if they were not on the same level at all!</p><p></p><p>They were instantly horrified, and stared at Lu Changsheng, fearfully shouting, "Who... who are you?!"</p><p></p><p>Swoosh, swoosh, swoosh!</p><p></p><p>The azure sword energy storm attacked!</p><p></p><p>The sword energy storm shook the stars in this region, their towering illusory forms shattering bit by bit in the endless void!</p><p></p><p>The residual waves spread out in this void, rippling outwards before gradually dissipating.</p><p></p><p>With just this one sword strike, the five Wujie Tiandao were annihilated without even getting a chance to make a move.</p><p></p><p>They had come quickly, and left just as fast.</p><p></p><p>"Gulp..."</p><p></p><p>Li Shuyan stared blankly at the scene before him, his Adam's apple bobbing up and down, his mouth dry.</p><p></p><p>The teacher's power had once again exceeded his comprehension!</p><p></p><p>His mind and spirit were trembling.</p><p></p><p>He didn't know why there would be such a powerful person as the teacher in this world...</p><p></p><p>His cultivation seemed to be an endless abyss - the stronger the enemy, the stronger the teacher became!</p><p></p><p>"Clang!"</p><p></p><p>Lu Changsheng suddenly tossed the sword and its sheath over.</p><p></p><p>Li Shuyan paused, quickly catching them, immediately feeling the icy, tingling sensation in his palms.</p><p></p><p>He looked down dazedly at the sword that had annihilated five Wujie Tiandao.</p><p></p><p>The sheath was dark, with faint dragon-like patterns etched on it, appearing quite ordinary overall.</p><p></p><p>"Don't put it away yet, you'll be my sword servant and hold it for me from now on," Lu Changsheng said, glancing at a certain direction.</p><p></p><p>"Yes..." Li Shuyan quickly agreed, unable to hold back his curiosity: "Teacher, what is the name of this sword?"</p><p></p><p>Lu Changsheng was slightly taken aback, then smiled wryly: "Ah, I actually forgot, this sword is one I forged long ago, and I haven't given it a name until now."</p><p></p><p>Li Shuyan was shocked, staring at the sword in his hands in disbelief - this sword was personally forged by the teacher?</p><p></p><p>Cough, such a peerless sword, and the teacher was so casual about it.</p><p></p><p>At this moment, the sword sheath trembled slightly, and Li Shuyan was startled to sense a dissatisfied emotion from it.</p><p></p><p>Lu Changsheng's brow furrowed, his gaze falling on the sword. "How dare you be dissatisfied?"</p><p></p><p>Immediately, the long sword became still, no longer daring to show any discontent.</p><p></p><p>"Alright, from now on, I'll name you Zhan Xu (Sever the Void)," Lu Changsheng said indifferently.</p><p></p><p>The long sword trembled slightly, seemingly very satisfied with this name, which implied the ability to sever the endless void - how majestic, perfectly fitting its bearing.</p><p></p><p>Lu Changsheng gave a faint, mocking smile. It was true that this sword was forged by him, but he hadn't been very serious about it at the time, only pursuing it to be hard enough and usable. Otherwise, this sword's quality could have been even higher.</p><p></p><p>Calling it "Sever the Void" was actually an exaggeration.</p><p></p><p>For him, the sword didn't matter much - as long as it was usable and wouldn't easily break, that was enough.</p><p></p><p>Whether it could sever the void or not, it depended on the one wielding the sword.</p><p></p><p>The essence of the sword dao was not about the sword bestowing great abilities upon the cultivator, but the cultivator imbuing the sword with power.</p><p></p><p>The stronger the sword cultivator, the stronger the sword.</p><p></p><p>A single leaf can sever mountains and seas, a single thought can sever the starry river - the true sword cultivator can make anything into a sword.</p><p></p><p>He had long reached that level, but having a tangible sword as a medium to channel his power would make things much easier for him. Why not take advantage of that?</p><p></p><p>Here is the full English translation of the Chinese excerpt:</p><p></p><p>"Mr. Li, where shall we go next?" Li Shuyan asked respectfully, holding the Void Cutter sword.</p><p></p><p>Lu Changsheng looked towards a certain direction, then raised his hand to touch his face.</p><p></p><p>In the next moment, an ancient bronze mask was placed on his face, concealing his features.</p><p></p><p>He then strode towards the empty space in that direction.</p><p></p><p>Li Shuyan snapped out of his daze and silently followed, still holding the Void Cutter.</p><p></p><p>...</p><p></p><p>At the same time, not far away, a group of young men and women stood stiffly, their expressions filled with doubt and fear.</p><p></p><p>They did not know what had happened, as the distance was a bit far, and countless stars obstructed their vision, preventing them from seeing clearly.</p><p></p><p>They only knew that after the terrifying sword cry, the Boundless Heavenly Dao seemed to have disappeared.</p><p></p><p>The endless void in this area had returned to silence.</p><p></p><p>"How... how did it become so quiet?" </p><p></p><p>"I don't know, perhaps the mysterious expert and the Boundless Heavenly Dao fought their way to another void space..."</p><p></p><p>"It's too terrifying! To actually witness an expert battling the Heavenly Dao, phew."</p><p></p><p>"Who in our void would dare to defy the Heavenly Dao? Surely not the Eight Ancient Clans?"</p><p></p><p>"That sword energy wave... it's very likely from the sword clan among the Eight Ancient Clans."</p><p></p><p>"Tsk! You mean the Ancient Desolate Sword Clan!"</p><p></p><p>The young men and women whispered anxiously, guessing that the suspected expert from the Ancient Desolate Sword Clan and the Boundless Heavenly Dao had moved their battle to another void space. They couldn't help but feel relieved.</p><p></p><p>They all had the expression of survivors.</p><p></p><p>Whether it was the Eight Ancient Clans or the Boundless Heavenly Dao, they were existences that were too daunting for them to look up to.</p><p></p><p>"Miss, young master, shall we still go collect the void herbs?" a servant asked, looking towards the well-dressed young man and woman, who seemed to be the leaders.</p><p></p><p>The young man in blue clothes, his features still somewhat youthful, turned to the woman beside him, seeking her guidance, as it was clear she was the one they all looked to.</p><p></p><p>The woman wore a flowing white silk dress, her expression slightly cold. It seemed she had not heard the others' words, her gaze still fixed on the void where the sword cry had come from, her brow slightly furrowed.</p><p></p><p>"Sister?" the young man, Fu Tao, called out.</p><p></p><p>Fu Shiyu's eyes flickered as she snapped out of her daze, turning to look at the others. She pressed her lips together before speaking, "Let's not collect the void herbs today. The endless void is too dangerous now, with the appearance of the Boundless Heavenly Dao and the suspected expert from an ancient clan. We should head back."</p><p></p><p>"Understood." Fu Tao and the others visibly relaxed.</p><p></p><p>After that encounter, they dared not linger in the endless void any longer.</p><p></p><p>They were secretly disappointed, as this was a rare opportunity for the Fu family to collect the precious void herbs, and now it had been wasted. Who knew when the next chance would come, perhaps tens of thousands of years later.</p><p></p><p>"Don't worry too much, everyone. Although the void herbs are precious, our lives are more important. I will explain the situation to the clan leader and the elders when we return. Let's hurry back now."</p><p></p><p>Fu Shiyu comforted them and turned to lead the way back.</p><p></p><p>The others followed suit, preparing to leave.</p><p></p><p>But in the next moment, Fu Shiyu's gaze suddenly rippled, like the surface of water.</p><p></p><p>The others' expressions also changed, and they quickly took a step back.</p><p></p><p>For unbeknownst to them, two figures had appeared behind them.</p><p></p><p>One was a silent, black-robed youth holding a long sword, his expression wooden as he slightly bowed.</p><p></p><p>And leading them was a mysterious figure in blue, wearing an ancient bronze mask and with his hands clasped behind his back.</p>

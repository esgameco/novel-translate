        <h1>Chapter 529</h1>
        <div class="content">
            <p>Here is the full English translation of the Chinese excerpt:</p><p></p><p>"Another... another Earth Vein!!"</p><p></p><p>Everyone couldn't help but take a sharp breath, their minds spinning.</p><p></p><p>What was going on in Jixiang Town? Not only were there so many Martial Veins, but there were even three Earth Veins among them!</p><p></p><p>Huang Yulang gritted his teeth, and it was true - the fifteen Martial Veins that had appeared were all from the students of the Longevity Academy!</p><p></p><p>Huang Yulang looked at the group, where there were still hundreds of children left, and he even suspected that most of them might have already lost their Martial Veins!</p><p></p><p>It was possible that among all the children present, only the fifteen students from the Longevity Academy possessed Martial Veins...</p><p></p><p>Han Tie and Wu Cuilan were gripping each other's hands tightly, their reactions even more intense than Huang Xuan's parents and Ye Xiaoxiao's parents.</p><p></p><p>The two of them were pale-faced, their eyes moist, and they remained silent for a long time.</p><p></p><p>Song Ren regained his composure and, without paying attention to the crystals on the ground, asked, "Child, what is your name?"</p><p></p><p>Han Yue replied dazedly, "Han... Han Yue."</p><p></p><p>"Han Yue, would you be willing to join the Tianwu Sect? With an Earth Vein like yours, you are destined for greatness in the future! The Tianwu Sect is the best sect in the Star Luo Empire, and it would be the best place for you!"</p><p></p><p>Song Ren lowered his voice, trying to calm himself down.</p><p></p><p>Today's surprises were truly too great!</p><p></p><p>"I... I..." Han Yue stammered a bit, still dazed by the attention, and feeling quite nervous.</p><p></p><p>After all, he was just a child. Han Yue couldn't help but turn his head to look at Han Tie and Wu Cuilan, only to find that his parents were also standing there dumbfounded.</p><p></p><p>Song Ren furrowed his brow slightly and asked again, "Han Yue, are you willing to join the Tianwu Sect?"</p><p></p><p>Faced with this life-changing decision, Han Yue was extremely nervous, and the image of his teacher involuntarily surfaced in his mind.</p><p></p><p>"Han Yue, no one in the world will take pity on you. Everything you get must be earned through your own efforts, and only what you obtain yourself is truly yours."</p><p></p><p>"Han Yue, in my Longevity Academy, everyone is equal. The road ahead may be difficult, but from the moment you entered the Longevity Academy, anything is possible."</p><p></p><p>"The Book and the Martial, the Heavenly and the Earthly, the pen is mightier than the sword, attacking the enemy with ink - have you not heard of this?"</p><p></p><p>"Once you have memorized the Three-Character Classic, after the home visit, I will take you to see a different world."</p><p></p><p>"..."</p><p></p><p>Han Yue recalled his teacher's free lessons, the teachings and the profound words, as well as that night's unexpected telekinetic display.</p><p></p><p>Han Yue's face turned pale, and large beads of sweat rolled down his forehead!</p><p></p><p>Now was the time for him to make a choice!</p><p></p><p>On one side was the Tianwu Sect, extending an olive branch.</p><p></p><p>On the other side was the mysterious and benevolent teacher!</p><p></p><p>One side offered the martial path that could quickly improve his family's circumstances.</p><p></p><p>The other side represented the uncertain future of the literary path.</p><p></p><p>Following his heart, Han Yue had actually made his choice quite quickly. His teacher had treated him exceptionally well, and he did not want to disappoint him. He wanted to continue staying at the Longevity Academy, truly believing that his teacher could guide him into the literary path.</p><p></p><p>But at this moment, the hardships of his parents and the difficult circumstances of his family were weighing heavily on him.</p><p></p><p>He was afraid that his choice would not be understood or accepted by his parents, and that they would be disappointed.</p><p></p><p>Han Yue couldn't help but look around at the sea of people, but there was still no sign of his teacher.</p><p></p><p>"Hmm?" Song Ren furrowed his brow, a bad feeling emerging in his heart, and he asked, "Han Yue, what are you still hesitating about?!"</p><p></p><p>"I... I..." Han Yue started panting, his body covered in sweat.</p><p></p><p>At this moment, Han Tie suddenly shouted loudly, "Iron Egg, this is your own life, you make the choice! Follow the path your heart desires!"</p><p></p><p>No one knows a child better than their parents.</p><p></p><p>Wu Cuilan also seemed to understand what Han Yue was struggling with, and she said in a trembling voice, "Iron Egg, no matter how you choose, your father and mother will support you!"</p><p></p><p>They both knew...</p><p></p><p>Here is the full English translation of the Chinese excerpt:</p><p></p><p>The turmoil in Han Yue's heart must be because of his teacher, Mr. Lu.</p><p></p><p>Mr. Lu had given their family an opportunity, an almost free tuition opportunity. If Han Yue were to join the Tianwu Sect now, it would surely disappoint him.</p><p></p><p>Simplicity and honesty were things deeply ingrained in the bloodline of these impoverished families.</p><p></p><p>And most importantly, they also knew that Mr. Lu was no ordinary person!</p><p></p><p>That night's remote object retrieval had clearly demonstrated Mr. Lu's abilities!</p><p></p><p>Han Tie and Wu Cuilan were willing to take a gamble, willing to believe in that gentle gentleman in the blue robe!</p><p></p><p>Hearing this, Han Yue suddenly burst into tears, but his tone was firm as he said, "Thank you, sir, for your kind offer, but what I care about, just like Xiao Xiao, is the way of the book!"</p><p></p><p>A commotion erupted in the crowd, filled with disbelief. They couldn't believe another student had rejected the olive branch of the Tianwu Sect!</p><p></p><p>"Has anyone noticed? All fifteen children with martial veins are Mr. Lu's students?"</p><p></p><p>Suddenly, someone realized this and exclaimed in shock.</p><p></p><p>Immediately, the villagers reacted, stunned. It was true!</p><p></p><p>All fifteen children with martial veins were students of the Longevity Academy!</p><p></p><p>Heavens!</p><p></p><p>Song Ren's face darkened as he reminded Han Yue, "Han Yue, you too, don't make decisions too hastily. Go and discuss this with your parents first! Don't ruin your future!"</p><p></p><p>After saying this, Song Ren calmed the crowd down and continued with the crystal stone testing, but his mood was somewhat unpleasant.</p><p></p><p>Although there were three Earth Martial Veins, two of them actually refused to join the Tianwu Sect?</p><p></p><p>This was no laughing matter!</p><p></p><p>Song Ren couldn't understand it. The way of the book had fallen into such decline, and yet they still wanted to pursue it. Moreover, did they really think becoming a book cultivator was that simple?</p><p></p><p>They had Earth Martial Veins, yet they were turning down the great opportunity in front of them to choose the way of the book. In Song Ren's eyes, this was foolish!</p><p></p><p>No matter what, he had to bring these two children with martial veins back to the Tianwu Sect, even if he had to force them!</p><p></p><p>"Next!"</p><p>"Next!"</p><p>"......"</p><p>"Testing complete!"</p><p></p><p>Soon, all the children had been tested. As expected, after Han Yue, there were no more martial veins detected.</p><p></p><p>So in the entire crowd, only the fifteen students of the Longevity Academy had martial veins!</p><p></p><p>Song Ren took a light breath and looked at the twelve children with ordinary martial veins beside him, smiling as he asked, "Are you willing to join the Tianwu Sect?"</p><p></p><p>"Yes, sir, I'm willing!"</p><p>"I'm willing too!"</p><p>"......"</p><p></p><p>"Sir, I... I'm also drawn to the way of the book, so I won't join the Tianwu Sect."</p><p></p><p>Suddenly, among the twelve children, a young boy scratched his head awkwardly.</p><p></p><p>Huh? Another one who didn't want to join?!</p><p></p><p>Song Ren finally lost his patience, frowning at the young boy as he asked, "The great opportunity is right in front of you, yet you don't want it! You want to pursue the elusive way of the book instead?! What are you thinking? Where are your parents?!"</p><p></p><p>Xiao Fan scratched his head, "Sir, Xiao Fan has no parents, only grandparents. My grandparents haven't come yet, so Xiao Fan can make the decision himself."</p><p></p><p>Song Ren lost his patience. After all, it was just an ordinary martial vein, and if the child didn't want to seize the opportunity, he couldn't be bothered to persuade him. He waved his hand and said, "Suit yourself, I hope you won't regret it in the future."</p><p></p><p>"Yes, sir."</p><p></p><p>Xiao Fan gave a shy smile, glanced at the other eleven classmates, and then withdrew under the many sighs of regret.</p>

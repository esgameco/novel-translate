        <h1>Chapter 476</h1>
        <div class="content">
            <p>Here is the full English translation of the Chinese excerpt:</p><p></p><p>A moment later, the deck of the Sea Transport No. 3 was crowded with figures, and for a moment, an aura of malice pervaded the deck, with unceasing cold laughter.</p><p></p><p>In some of the luxurious suites, the screams of female cultivators could even be heard.</p><p></p><p>The Sea Transport No. 3 was the name of the ship that Lü Changsheng was traveling on this time.</p><p></p><p>At the same time, in the ship's cabin, the captain was holding a sea chart and using a formation to urgently call for help from the Merchant's Guild:</p><p></p><p>"The Sea Transport No. 3 has encountered sea demonic cultivators, the approximate location is..."</p><p></p><p>As long as the approximate sea area was reported, when the Merchant's Guild's rescue arrived, they would be able to precisely locate the Sea Transport No. 3 through the special formation on the ship.</p><p></p><p>Of course, anyone would know that by the time the Merchant's Guild's rescue arrived, it would be too late.</p><p></p><p>This was just a necessary report required by the Merchant's Guild regulations in case of an incident.</p><p></p><p>"Bang--"</p><p></p><p>Suddenly, a sea demonic cultivator broke into the cabin, his eyes bloodthirsty, but his tone strangely gentle,</p><p></p><p>"Oh~ my dear captain~ what are you doing? Everyone is waiting for you outside, please come out?"</p><p></p><p>The captain was startled, put away the sea chart, and silently walked out of the cabin.</p><p></p><p>The sea demonic cultivator looked at the communication formation in the cabin and sneered coldly. Of course, he knew what the captain had just done.</p><p></p><p>But what use was it? </p><p></p><p>In the vast sea, the sea demonic cultivators were not afraid of any so-called rescue.</p><p></p><p>Let's see who can arrive first, hehe.</p><p></p><p>With that, the sea demonic cultivator punched and shattered the communication formation, then turned and hummed a little tune as he left.</p><p></p><p>...</p><p></p><p>At this time, on the deck.</p><p></p><p>A black-robed, masked man coldly shouted:</p><p></p><p>"All of you, stand in order! Men and women separate! If you don't want to die, behave!"</p><p></p><p>Under his command, no one dared to resist, and soon the male cultivators stood together, and the female cultivators stood together, all with pale faces, silent and obedient.</p><p></p><p>Lü Changsheng also silently followed Chen Pang and Xiao Chai to stand with the male cultivator group, his face expressionless.</p><p></p><p>Chen Pang and Xiao Chai, however, were pale-faced, especially Chen Pang, whose lips were trembling, clearly terrified.</p><p></p><p>"Pang, calm down." Xiao Chai transmitted to him.</p><p></p><p>"Brother, I can't calm down. I've cultivated for years, but I'm still a virgin. I don't want to die," Chen Pang replied dejectedly.</p><p></p><p>Xiao Chai fell silent, then transmitted: "Let's see how it goes first. If the sea demonic cultivators are only after wealth, we may escape unharmed. But if they want both wealth and lives, then we can only fight them to the death."</p><p></p><p>Chen Pang nodded hopelessly, then suddenly glanced at Lü Changsheng and was surprised to see his unperturbed expression, and couldn't help but ask, "Fellow Daoist Lü, have you made peace with it?"</p><p></p><p>Lü Changsheng paused, gave Chen Pang a faint glance, and did not respond.</p><p></p><p>"Stand in order! Open your storage spaces honestly, and if anyone dares to resist, hehe..."</p><p></p><p>At this time, many sea demonic cultivators came up and checked each cultivator's storage space.</p><p></p><p>The cultivators naturally dared not argue with the ruthless sea demonic cultivators, and could only silently open their storage spaces for them to check and take.</p><p></p><p>"We are from the Elemental Realm's Elf Tribe, could you please give us some face?"</p><p></p><p>Just then, one of the female cultivators said to the sea demonic cultivator in front of her.</p><p></p><p>Elf Tribe?</p><p></p><p>Instantly, many gazes turned in that direction, filled with disbelief and confusion.</p><p></p><p>Those two female cultivators were wearing black robes, so their appearances couldn't be seen...</p><p></p><p>The sea demonic cultivator who was about to check their storage space had his eyes slightly change, and he said in a vicious tone:</p><p></p><p>"You say you're from the Elf Tribe? Better show some proof, or else I'll just take you!"</p><p></p><p>But the next moment...</p><p></p><p>Here is the full English translation of the Chinese excerpt:</p><p></p><p>The two female cultivators took off their hat covers, revealing long, flowing green-blue hair and exquisitely beautiful features, especially their lively, elf-like ears.</p><p></p><p>"Whew, they really are from the Elf Clan! I've had the fortune of seeing them before - this is the Elf Clan!"</p><p></p><p>"Wow, the elves are so beautiful and seem to have a fragrant aura about them."</p><p></p><p>"......"</p><p></p><p>On the other side, Chen Pang's eyes were wide open, momentarily forgetting his current predicament.</p><p></p><p>"Big brother, the elves are so pretty, I like them. If only I could take one as my wife."</p><p></p><p>Little Chai mercilessly struck him down, "Pang, let's focus on surviving first."</p><p></p><p>Chen Pang suddenly snapped back to reality, remembering his dire situation.</p><p></p><p>Nearby, Lu Changsheng glanced briefly at the two elf girls before turning his gaze away.</p><p></p><p>He was familiar with the Elf Clan. Luo You's memories contained information about them.</p><p></p><p>The Elf Clan's combat prowess was slightly inferior, but they held a special position in the Dao Sea. This was because they represented the highest level of the Wood Dao. </p><p></p><p>The Wood Dao had a unique ability - extraordinary healing powers. Many forces had received treatment from the Elf Clan, granting them this special status, much like how patients are usually polite and friendly towards their doctors.</p><p></p><p>"Ah, so they really are from the Elf Clan?!"</p><p></p><p>On the Sea Demon Cultivator's ship, all the sea cultivators' expressions changed as they looked towards their hooded, middle-aged leader in distress, unsure of how to proceed.</p><p></p><p>The hooded leader stared at the two elf girls for a moment, seemingly contemplating. The elf girls felt relieved, thinking they might be able to escape this ordeal, as the Elf Clan's reputation preceded them.</p><p></p><p>But suddenly, the hooded leader let out a cold laugh: "Hehe, I've played with many women, but I've never had the pleasure of an elf. Today is truly my lucky day... Brothers, want to join in?"</p><p></p><p>The sea cultivators were shocked, their expressions shifting rapidly. Soon, they eagerly shouted, "Of course! Leader can go first, and leave us the leftovers, hehe!"</p><p></p><p>The cultivators' hearts sank. They never imagined the sea cultivators would be so shameless as to dare offend the Elf Clan. If they didn't spare the elves, there was no way they would be spared either. The sea cultivators would surely kill them all to cover their tracks.</p><p></p><p>"You... you..." The two elf girls were also taken aback by this turn of events, their expressions becoming panicked.</p><p></p><p>The hooded leader eyed the elf girls greedily, sneering, "In the vast ocean, once I'm done playing with you, I'll erase all traces. Who will ever know?"</p><p></p><p>Hearing this, the elf girls' faces drained of color, their delicate bodies trembling.</p><p></p><p>The hooded leader let out a cold laugh, then waved his hand and commanded, "Brothers, quickly, take all their treasures, don't miss a single one!"</p><p></p><p>"Yes, sir!"</p>

        <h1>Chapter 457</h1>
        <div class="content">
            <p>Here is the full English translation of the Chinese excerpt:</p><p></p><p>"Greetings, I am from the Ye Clan and have been summoned by your Clan Leader to pay a visit."</p><p></p><p>In front of the grand gates of the Hong Clan, Ye Nantian politely cupped his hands and spoke to the gatekeeper.</p><p></p><p>The esteemed Clan Leader of a top-tier ancient clan, coming to the Hong Clan, was even courteous to the gatekeeper, demonstrating the formidable might of the super ancient clans!</p><p></p><p>"Clan Leader Ye, please sign in and you may enter. Our Clan Leader has been awaiting your arrival."</p><p></p><p>The gatekeeper disciple bowed and smiled. </p><p></p><p>Although he was from the Hong Clan, he naturally did not dare to be impolite when facing Ye Nantian, the Clan Leader of a top-tier ancient clan.</p><p></p><p>It is true that the super ancient clans hold lofty status, but there are only a hundred top-tier ancient clans in the Hollow Ancient Realm!</p><p></p><p>Not to mention, he was just an ordinary disciple of the Hong Clan, while the other was the Clan Leader of a top-tier ancient clan.</p><p></p><p>"Haha, very well." Ye Nantian smiled and briefly signed the registry, then gestured for Lu Changsheng to enter first.</p><p></p><p>Lu Changsheng did not put on airs either, slightly nodding his head before entering the Hong Clan.</p><p></p><p>Until Ye Nantian, Lu Changsheng, and the other two had disappeared from sight,</p><p></p><p>the two gatekeeper disciples curiously discussed the names and titles written in the registry:</p><p></p><p>"Eh, when did the Ye Clan have an additional Offering Elder?"</p><p></p><p>"I have no idea, I've never heard of this before. The Ye Clan is a top-tier ancient clan, logically they should have held a grand ceremony to announce the appointment of a new Offering Elder and invited all the clans..."</p><p></p><p>"Nevermind, this is not something we can ponder over. To be appointed as an Offering Elder of the Ye Clan, his cultivation must be exceptionally high..."</p><p></p><p>"Mm, you've also seen how the Clan Leader Ye behaved in front of that young man. It seems like that young man is the one in charge. This reveals a lot."</p><p></p><p>"..."</p><p></p><p>...</p><p></p><p>In the Hong Clan's main hall, </p><p></p><p>there were numerous figures seated on the sides, engaged in casual conversation.</p><p></p><p>These were no ordinary people - they were either Clan Leaders of top-tier ancient clans like Ye Nantian, or Elders of top-tier ancient clans.</p><p></p><p>It can be said that each and every one of them was a highly esteemed and powerful figure.</p><p></p><p>"Ah, I just counted, and so far only thirty-nine top-tier ancient clans have arrived? At this rate, it seems that the majority have sided with the He Clan?"</p><p></p><p>"What about the Ouyang Clan, will they come today?"</p><p></p><p>"Haha, the Ouyang Clan? As a Clan Leader, how can you be so out of the loop? Haven't you heard? The Ouyang Clan is said to have sided with the He Clan!"</p><p></p><p>"What?! Is this true?!"</p><p></p><p>In an instant, many Clan Leaders who had just learned of this shocking news abruptly stood up, their faces pale with disbelief as they stared at the Clan Leader who had delivered this bombshell.</p><p></p><p>That Clan Leader, seeing their reactions, exclaimed in bewilderment: "What? So many of you didn't know? The current situation is extremely dire for us!"</p><p></p><p>Suddenly, several Clan Leaders could no longer remain seated, their expressions twisted with worry as they prepared to leave the Hong Clan's main hall!!</p><p></p><p>If they had known earlier that even the Ouyang Clan had sided with the He Clan, why would they have come to the Hong Clan in the first place?! </p><p>This was just walking straight into a dead end!</p><p></p><p>Soon, a few Clan Leaders finally made up their minds, one after another cupping their hands and saying:</p><p></p><p>"Fellow Clan Leaders, I suddenly recall there is a matter in my clan that requires my attention, so I must take my leave for now and visit again another day."</p><p></p><p>"I just remembered that my clan's revered ancestor has caught a cold these past few days, and it is time for him to take his medicine, so I must return to attend to him."</p><p></p><p>"Yes, my ancestor is also unwell."</p><p></p><p>"..."</p><p></p><p>After saying this, the few Clan Leaders, heedless of the bewildered onlookers, resolutely turned and headed for the exit.</p><p></p><p>At this moment, a deep, cold laughter suddenly rang out:</p><p></p><p>"Fellow Clan Leaders, in such a hurry, where are you all going?"</p><p></p><p>Immediately, the steps of those Clan Leaders faltered, and they stiffly turned around to face the middle-aged man who had appeared on the dais.</p><p></p><p>"Clan Leader Hong... we were just..."</p><p></p><p>The others watching the Clan Leaders could see the darkness in their eyes - they all understood what was going through their minds...</p><p></p><p>Alas, they had already stepped into the Hong Clan's domain.</p><p></p><p>Here is the full English translation of the Chinese excerpt:</p><p></p><p>There was no turning back from that moment on.</p><p></p><p>Hong Wuju coldly smiled: "As cultivators, you actually use catching a cold as an excuse, which is simply ridiculous. Not to mention your ancestral patriarch is a divine void, even the weakest qi-refining cultivator would not be able to catch a cold, right?"</p><p></p><p>The several clan elders' faces flushed slightly, not daring to refute.</p><p></p><p>"Since you've come, please have a seat," Hong Wuju coldly looked at the clan elders and commanded.</p><p></p><p>"Sigh." The clan elders sighed one after another, helplessly sitting back down. At this point, whatever they said would be too late, there was no turning back.</p><p></p><p>At this time, Hong Wuju swept a glance across the main hall, then sighed:</p><p></p><p>"Thirty-nine, merely thirty-nine clans. Could it be that the other sixty-one prestigious ancient clans have all gone to support the He Clan?"</p><p></p><p>The many clan elders in the hall exchanged glances, speechless.</p><p></p><p>There was no helping it. Even the Ouyang Clan had supported the He Clan, in fact any clear-headed prestigious ancient clan would support the He Clan.</p><p></p><p>As for their thirty-nine clans, a large part of them didn't even know about the Ouyang Clan's matter before coming, ending up in an irreversible misunderstanding.</p><p></p><p>And a small part, just like the Ye Clan, thought that as long as the Hong Clan was still here, there was still hope.</p><p></p><p>"The Ye Clan has arrived!"</p><p></p><p>At this moment, a voice of report came from outside the hall, causing the eyes of the many clan elders to suddenly brighten, not expecting another prestigious ancient clan to arrive?</p><p></p><p>Hong Wuju's expression also eased up a bit, his gaze turning towards the entrance of the hall.</p><p></p><p>Soon, Lu Changsheng and Ye Nantian entered the main hall.</p><p></p><p>"Hong Clan Leader, has the Ye Clan arrived too late?" Ye Nantian smiled and cupped his hands towards Hong Wuju on the dais.</p><p></p><p>At this time, the gazes of the people in the hall all swept over Ye Nantian and the two elders, finally resting on Lu Changsheng's body.</p><p></p><p>The people's eyes were filled with puzzlement, they were all familiar with the Ye Clan's upper echelons, but this young man in blue robes was someone they had never seen before.</p><p></p><p>"Hehe, not late, Ye Clan Leader and the Ye Clan's elders, please have a seat quickly," Hong Wuju waved his hand and invited.</p><p></p><p>"Okay." Ye Nantian cupped his hands in response, then looked at Lu Changsheng, gesturing towards a seat: "Elder Lu, you and I will sit over there."</p><p></p><p>Lu Changsheng lightly nodded his head and followed Ye Nantian to a seat, while the second elder and third elder stood behind the two of them.</p><p></p><p>Oh?</p><p></p><p>This scene, when seen by the others, made them even more curious.</p><p></p><p>It should be known that here, only the clan leaders were seated, and the clan elders were basically all standing.</p><p></p><p>Finally, one of the clan leaders couldn't hold back and curiously asked: "Ye Clan Leader, who is this... won't you introduce him?"</p><p></p><p>Ye Nantian paused, noticing the puzzlement in everyone's eyes, even Hong Wuju was looking at him, so he stood up and smiled as he cupped his hands towards the crowd:</p><p></p><p>"Hong Clan Leader, esteemed clan leaders, Elder Lu is the newly appointed Offering Elder of our Ye Clan. A while ago, we were planning to hold a grand ceremony, but Elder Lu felt it was too much trouble, so we didn't hold it. The neighboring clans of our Ye Clan should have heard about it, right? I specifically sent messages to inform them at the time."</p><p></p><p>So this person was the newly appointed Offering Elder of the Ye Clan!?</p><p></p><p>Many clan elders and elders looked at Lu Changsheng with slight shock.</p><p></p><p>Hong Wuju and many other clan leaders who didn't know about this matter were also sizing up Lu Changsheng, their eyes flickering.</p><p></p><p>To become the Offering Elder of a prestigious ancient clan, he's no ordinary person...</p><p></p><p>After all, the position of Offering Elder is a very important one, and the number of families with Offering Elders among the top-tier ancient clans does not exceed ten!</p><p></p><p>Lu Changsheng noticed the many gazes scrutinizing him, and suddenly spoke in a faint tone:</p><p></p><p>"You all are staring at me so intently, have you discovered something?"</p><p></p><p>This sudden remark made the main hall fall silent, and Ye Nantian's heart raced!</p>

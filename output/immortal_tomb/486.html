        <h1>Chapter 486</h1>
        <div class="content">
            <p>Here is the full English translation of the Chinese excerpt:</p><p></p><p>The streets of Yeyecheng were in an uproar.</p><p></p><p>"Have you heard? The Three Tigers Gang has summoned all their members, and it seems all three gang leaders are there, exuding a murderous aura!"</p><p></p><p>"Whew, what exactly happened? I've been feeling that the Three Tigers Gang has been acting strange today, as if they're searching for something everywhere..."</p><p></p><p>"Hehe, you don't know? It seems the Three Tigers Gang's Grand Elder has run into some trouble."</p><p></p><p>"What? The Grand Elder has run into trouble? How did you find that out?!"</p><p></p><p>"Tsk, many people know about it. Today, a lot of people in the city have been stopped by Three Tigers Gang members and asked if they've seen their Grand Elder or something. What do you think?"</p><p></p><p>"Ah! Judging from the Three Tigers Gang's actions, could it be that..."</p><p></p><p>"That's right, the Three Tigers Gang's Grand Elder has most likely been killed, and the culprit... I'm sure you all have your guesses, huh?"</p><p></p><p>"..."</p><p></p><p>Just as the people were discussing animatedly, a fierce shout rang out across the entire Yeyecheng:</p><p></p><p>"Raging Lion Sect! Savage Elephant Sect! You two factions, come out!"</p><p></p><p>"This... This is the voice of the Three Tigers Gang's Grand Leader!"</p><p></p><p>Instantly, Yeyecheng was in an uproar, and everyone was stunned.</p><p></p><p>"Hmph, Three Tigers Gang Leader, you've provoked us Raging Lion Sect and Savage Elephant Sect without reason today. If you don't give us an explanation, our Sect Leader and Sect Master won't let this go!"</p><p></p><p>The next moment, two streams of light rushed towards the Three Tigers Gang from different directions in Yeyecheng.</p><p></p><p>Seeing this, the crowd was excited, knowing that these were the forces of the Raging Lion Sect and Savage Elephant Sect, and they hurried to gather towards that area.</p><p></p><p>At the same time, Captain as well as Chen Pang, Xiao Chai, and other cultivators who knew the origins of the matter also frowned and headed in that direction.</p><p></p><p>After all, when there's no clue, it's better to watch the dog-eat-dog show. Especially this kind of feeling of being the only sober one among the drunk, it's quite delightful.</p><p></p><p>Watching the dogs bite each other, isn't that wonderful?</p><p></p><p>After all, among these three factions in Yeyecheng Island, there's not a single good one.</p><p></p><p>Meanwhile, in the restaurant.</p><p></p><p>Hearing the commotion, the old turtle's expression became slightly puzzled, not understanding what was happening.</p><p></p><p>"Master, what are they doing, making such a ruckus so late at night?"</p><p></p><p>The old turtle was worried that these people would disturb Lu Changsheng, and thus spoke.</p><p></p><p>If it were in the past, with the old turtle's temperament, he would have definitely launched a thunderous attack and taught those noisy fellows a lesson.</p><p></p><p>But now, alas, his strength doesn't allow it! No choice! </p><p></p><p>If he goes to discipline others, and ends up getting beaten up instead, that would be too embarrassing.</p><p></p><p>The old turtle still has a good sense of self-awareness.</p><p></p><p>Lu Changsheng glanced at the old turtle with a faint smile and said:</p><p></p><p>"I do know a bit about it. It seems that one of the Three Tigers Gang's Elders has died."</p><p></p><p>"Master, could it be that you...?" The old turtle looked at Lu Changsheng and then spoke in a low voice.</p><p></p><p>Lu Changsheng's expression was indifferent as he said, "Of course not."</p><p></p><p>The old turtle smiled awkwardly, but in his heart, he still had some doubts.</p><p></p><p>...</p><p></p><p>In front of the Three Tigers Gang in Yeyecheng, the crowd had gathered, forming a sea of people. However, the scene had become quiet, and everyone was staring intently at the center.</p><p></p><p>Captain, Chen Pang, Xiao Chai, and the other cultivators were mixed in the crowd. Coincidentally, their positions were not far apart, and they all noticed each other.</p><p></p><p>They nodded at each other in acknowledgment, and then watched the show.</p><p></p><p>In the center, the three factions stood in a three-way standoff, coldly eyeing each other, their auras rising, as if they were about to engage in a fierce battle at any moment.</p><p></p><p>"Three Tigers Gang Leaders, your Three Tigers Gang has provoked us today with such words. If you don't give an explanation, my Raging Lion Sect won't let this go easily!" </p><p></p><p>The Raging Lion Sect Leader said coldly with his hands behind his back.</p><p></p><p>"That's right, my Savage Elephant Sect is the same! Since you Three Tigers Gang entered Yeyecheng Island, you've been arrogant and lawless. What, are you now declaring war on us two factions?"</p><p></p><p>The Savage Elephant Sect Master shouted loudly, his muscular body bulging, as if his clothes were about to burst.</p><p></p><p>In fact, the Raging Lion Sect and Savage Elephant Sect had already been very accommodating towards the Three Tigers Gang, because the Three Tigers Gang's strength was indeed formidable.</p><p></p><p>This was also the reason why the Three Tigers Gang dared to directly confront the two factions over the death of their Grand Elder.</p><p></p><p>The Three Tigers Gang, with their three Gang Leaders, the Grand Leader could single-handedly fight against one faction leader, while the Second and Third Leaders together could barely hold their own.</p><p></p><p>Here is the full English translation of the Chinese excerpt:</p><p></p><p>A Powerful Force!</p><p></p><p>Therefore, the Raging Lion Sect and the Savage Elephant Sect had no choice but to form an alliance in order to barely surpass the Three Tigers Gang, but it was only a slight advantage!</p><p></p><p>Moreover, the most important thing is that the two forces are not of the same origin, they are only in an alliance, so it is also very difficult for them to be united, and there are often differences.</p><p></p><p>The Three Tigers Gang, on the other hand, is much more united, after all, it is a whole.</p><p></p><p>"Hehe, you two, keep acting."</p><p></p><p>The Grand Patriarch looked at the two of them and sneered without stopping.</p><p></p><p>The Second Patriarch and the Third Patriarch stood on both sides, also sneering continuously.</p><p></p><p>The three patriarchs' eyes were full of ambition!</p><p></p><p>Of course, they could not have done all this just for a Hall Master!</p><p></p><p>Today, they had actually been waiting for a long time, and the death of the Big Bear was a very good opportunity!</p><p></p><p>Using this as an excuse, to eliminate the Raging Lion Sect and the Savage Elephant Sect, and become the sole overlord of Eternal Night Island, is their ultimate goal.</p><p></p><p>Moreover, the most important thing is that even if there is no evidence, it is certain that the death of the Big Bear was caused by these two forces, otherwise on this Eternal Night Island, who dares to go against the Three Tigers Gang?</p><p></p><p>Acting? Acting what?</p><p></p><p>The Raging Lion Sect Leader and the Savage Elephant Sect Master were puzzled, and even their many subordinates had strange expressions.</p><p></p><p>But soon, the Raging Lion Sect Leader and the Savage Elephant Sect Master reacted.</p><p></p><p>They naturally knew about the death of the Big Bear of the Three Tigers Gang.</p><p></p><p>So what does the Three Tigers Gang mean? Do they think the two of them are the killers?</p><p></p><p>The Raging Lion Sect Leader's face immediately darkened: "This Sect Leader just wondered what the Three Tigers Gang meant... Hehe, everything requires evidence, such groundless slander is not appropriate, is it?"</p><p></p><p>"Still acting?! Then tell me, on this island, besides you two, who dares to eat the heart and gall of the bear and kill my Three Tigers Gang Hall Master and hundreds of brothers? Who has that ability?"</p><p></p><p>The Grand Patriarch suddenly roared.</p><p></p><p>Seeing the Grand Patriarch's aggressive manner, the Raging Lion Sect Leader was also furious and shouted: "Heh, the heart and gall of the bear? Ability? Do you think your Three Tigers Gang is invincible?"</p><p></p><p>"Don't forget, this is the Sea of Laws! Although Eternal Night Island is only on the edge of the Sea of Laws, there are often passing ships landing on the island, can you guarantee that there are no strong ones among them? Can you guarantee that the strong ones who land on the island will indulge your Three Tigers Gang?"</p><p></p><p>"Don't think that this Sect Leader doesn't know that your Three Tigers Gang allows the people below to plunder the passing ships, light ones to rob property, heavy ones to kill and rob!"</p><p></p><p>"Hehe, in this Sect Leader's view, it's possible that your Three Tigers Gang has run into a hard nut to crack this time!"</p><p></p><p>The Grand Patriarch's eyes turned cold: "You...!"</p><p></p><p>"Big Brother, you don't need to say more to him, whether the Big Bear was killed by them or not, it doesn't matter anymore, right?"</p><p></p><p>"Yes, Big Brother, just start fighting directly, recently Second Brother's Laws Force has become more and more refined, and I and Second Brother may only be able to hold back the Savage Elephant Sect Master in the past, but this time, we must be able to kill him!"</p><p></p><p>The Second Patriarch and the Third Patriarch secretly transmitted.</p><p></p><p>Hearing this, the Grand Patriarch calmed his anger, his eyes icy cold, and suddenly waved his hand:</p><p></p><p>"Fight! The people of my Three Tigers Gang cannot die in vain! Avenge Big Bear and hundreds of brothers!!"</p><p></p><p>Boom!</p><p></p><p>The fighting spirit of all the members of the Three Tigers Gang was instantly ignited!</p><p></p><p>At this moment, they were moved in their hearts, feeling proud to be members of the Three Tigers Gang.</p><p></p><p>Boom!</p><p></p><p>Violent Laws Force instantly permeated the entire scene!</p><p></p><p>The onlookers were horrified and retreated!</p><p></p><p>The Raging Lion Sect and the Savage Elephant Sect were also incredulous, not expecting the Three Tigers Gang to be so fierce, saying they would fight and then fighting!</p><p></p><p>.........</p><p></p><p>"Master, it seems they are about to fight!" </p><p></p><p>Old Turtle said with slight shock, the violent Laws Force even made him feel heart-pounding.</p><p></p><p>At this time, only Luchang Sheng and Old Turtle were left in the restaurant, and all the others, including the Innkeeper, had gone to watch the excitement.</p><p></p><p>"What does it have to do with you? As long as it doesn't affect us here, let them fight as they please."</p><p></p><p>Luchang Sheng took a sip of wine and said.</p><p></p><p>"Oh..." Old Turtle nodded silently.</p><p></p><p>Since the master said so, then it's likely to affect us... After all, a battle of Laws Force has a wide-ranging impact.</p>

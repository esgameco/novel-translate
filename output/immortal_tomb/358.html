        <h1>Chapter 358</h1>
        <div class="content">
            <p>Here is the full English translation of the Chinese excerpt:</p><p></p><p>Outside the City of Man. 69shux.com</p><p></p><p>Jian Wuhui looked at the gradually dissipating fog of war and sighed lightly, then departed in the midst of respectful calls.</p><p></p><p>Yan Jueyi's eyes flickered, and he suddenly grabbed Mang Tian, about to rush towards the main palace of the City of Man!</p><p></p><p>Mang Tian was dumbfounded, "Bludgeon Saint, what are you doing!"</p><p></p><p>Yan Jueyi: "Mang King, don't panic, this Saint wants to invite you to drink."</p><p></p><p>Although Mang Tian was a bit suspicious, he couldn't refuse the kind invitation: "Alright."</p><p></p><p>Immediately after, the three Shenxiubound also exchanged glances and left together.</p><p></p><p>After the last Miaofan Kongzhen and the others of the Shenxianbound had departed, </p><p></p><p>the area outside the City of Man finally relaxed, as the big shots had all left, and they should disperse as well.</p><p></p><p>"Let's go back to the sect," Peng Fang sighed and said.</p><p></p><p>"Elder, we've come to the City of Man, but we haven't even gone in to play yet, and we're going back to the sect already?" Tong Xin pouted.</p><p></p><p>"That's right, Elder, since we're here, let's play a bit," Su Qianghe also smiled.</p><p></p><p>Peng Fang pursed his lips, "Alright then, I also didn't see Senior Gui earlier, perhaps he's still in this City of Man."</p><p></p><p>Hearing this, Tong Xin smiled.</p><p></p><p>...</p><p></p><p>The blazing solar wheel flashed with golden light as it traversed the low-visibility war fog.</p><p></p><p>On it, Mu Liangsiu and the nine others were seated together, looking at the three people across from them with admiration and awe as they casually drank.</p><p></p><p>They envied Lu Changsheng, who could raise a cup and converse with Wind Xing Venerable and Golden Wheel King, two powerful figures.</p><p></p><p>They had such high status.</p><p></p><p>Although they didn't know why Lu Changsheng was being treated so specially, when they thought about how even Sword Venerable was very polite to Lu Changsheng, they had nothing to say.</p><p></p><p>At the same time, at the table.</p><p></p><p>Jiang Wuxin looked at Lu Changsheng, her eyes sparkling as she said, "Little friend Lu, when we arrive at the Seven-colored Jade Tower, can you change your identity?"</p><p></p><p>Huh? Han Jinlong's eyes widened in surprise, but he didn't say anything, only pricking up his ears to listen.</p><p></p><p>He was very curious about how this Shenxianbound Lu Changsheng was connected to the Mang King, Wind Xing Venerable, and even Sword Venerable.</p><p></p><p>Lu Changsheng softly asked, "Wind Xing Venerable, what do you mean by this?"</p><p></p><p>Jiang Wuxin waved her hand to erect a sound barrier, then glanced at Han Jinlong, hesitating.</p><p></p><p>Han Jinlong's face immediately darkened: "Wind Xing Venerable, what are you trying to hide from this King? Are you not treating me as one of your own?"</p><p></p><p>"Ahem." Jiang Wuxin coughed lightly, then looked at Lu Changsheng and said, "Little friend Lu, you should still remember those five figures that appeared besides the Heavenly Dao Lord in the Eternal Celestial Domain, right?"</p><p></p><p>Lu Changsheng gently nodded, indicating that he remembered, and he also knew what Jiang Wuxin wanted to say.</p><p></p><p>The Heavenly Dao Lord?</p><p></p><p>Han Jinlong's eyes narrowed slightly.</p><p></p><p>Jiang Wuxin's expression became slightly serious as she said, "This time at the Seven-colored Jade Tower, with all the tribes vying for the jade, Zi Xuanyu, Xue Yue, and the others should also be present."</p><p></p><p>Han Jinlong trembled again, a bit confused. What, could it be that little friend Lu also has a grudge with Zi Xuanyu, Xue Yue and the others?</p><p></p><p>In his heart, Lu Changsheng became even more mysterious.</p><p></p><p>Little friend Lu, you're really something!</p><p></p><p>Although Shenxianbound cultivators have already entered the hall in the Divine-Demon Battlefield, compared to the Shenxiubound, the gap is still vast. Normally, Shenxianbound and Shenxiubound wouldn't even get entangled with each other.</p><p></p><p>But judging from Wind Xing Venerable's words and tone, it seems that little friend Lu has a grudge with Zi Xuanyu and the others.</p><p></p><p>That's really quite impressive.</p><p></p><p>Lu Changsheng's expression unchanged, he said, "So what if that's the case? Wind Xing Venerable..."</p><p></p><p>Here is the full English translation of the Chinese excerpt:</p><p></p><p>"Don't worry." </p><p></p><p>Han Jinlong: "......"</p><p></p><p>Jiang Wuxin: "......"</p><p></p><p>Jiang Wuxin fell silent for a moment. Lu Xiaoyou was still the same stubborn Lu Xiaoyou.</p><p></p><p>Ah, he had become a bit arrogant in the end.</p><p></p><p>He sighed and said:</p><p></p><p>"Lu Xiaoyou, during the time in the Eternal Realm, those were just the remnants of Zixuan Yong and Xue Yue's divine consciousness. But in this battlefield of gods and demons..."</p><p></p><p>Jiang Wuxin wanted to remind Lu Changsheng that the times had changed, and on this battlefield of gods and demons, what they would encounter would be the true forms of Zixuan Yong and the others!</p><p></p><p>Lu Changsheng smiled and said, "No problem, I can handle it."</p><p></p><p>Jiang Wuxin's expression fell, and he said in distress, "Lu Xiaoyou, please, I beg you, okay?"</p><p></p><p>The most, most, most important thing was that Lu Changsheng absolutely must not be discovered by Zixuan Yong and the others!</p><p></p><p>Apart from the risk of exposing his Immortal Physique, there was another reason - if they were discovered, Zixuan Yong and the others would become suspicious, and their subsequent schemes would be difficult to implement!</p><p></p><p>Everything, everything, had to wait until after the battle for the Seven-Colored Jade Tower was over, and then they could kill Zixuan Yong and the others!</p><p></p><p>Lu Changsheng looked at Jiang Wuxin, as if he understood the thoughts in his heart, and then sighed, "Alright."</p><p></p><p>"Good!" Jiang Wuxin was delighted and said, "Lu Xiaoyou, in addition to your appearance and physique, you should also use a false name next. That way, Zixuan Yong and the others won't associate you with it!"</p><p></p><p>Lu Changsheng smiled, his eyes flashing, and his appearance changed.</p><p></p><p>With a light flutter, a folding fan appeared in his hand, and he opened it with a "puff" and gently waved it.</p><p></p><p>"Ah, this, this, this, this!!!"</p><p></p><p>Han Jinlong suddenly stood up, his face flushed as he looked at Lu Changsheng.</p><p></p><p>Lu Changsheng's current appearance and this folding fan were exactly the same as the one he had seen when he first met him!</p><p></p><p>What did this mean?</p><p></p><p>It meant that Lu Changsheng had known all along that the young man in the black robe that day was Han Jinlong, the Golden Wheel King, in disguise!</p><p></p><p>It was as if he was slapping them in the face!</p><p></p><p>At this moment, Han Jinlong wished he could find a hole to crawl into.</p><p></p><p>Damn it, how did Lu Xiaoyou figure him out?</p><p></p><p>Jiang Wuxin was surprised and said, "Golden Wheel King, what is this...?"</p><p></p><p>"Forget it." Han Jinlong waved his hand, sat back down, and smiled bitterly, "Lu Xiaoyou, you knew all along that the one in the Xianhe Tavern that day was me?"</p><p></p><p>Lu Changsheng smiled without saying a word.</p><p></p><p>Han Jinlong shook his head, looking at Lu Changsheng with amazement, not knowing how he had seen through him.</p><p></p><p>He was confident that even if he met the Sword Sovereign himself, he might not be able to recognize him.</p><p></p><p>Seeing Jiang Wuxin's puzzled expression, Han Jinlong then recounted the details of his first meeting with Lu Changsheng.</p><p></p><p>Jiang Wuxin listened, also exclaiming in amazement, and looked at Lu Changsheng with great shock, "You could tell?"</p><p></p><p>Han Jinlong rolled his eyes and changed the subject, "Wind Sage, you should also tell me about how you, the Demon King, and the Sword Sovereign got to know Lu Xiaoyou. And why do Zixuan Yong and the others have a grudge against Lu Xiaoyou?"</p><p></p><p>Jiang Wuxin glanced at Lu Changsheng and hesitated, "Golden Wheel King, it's better not to ask about this..."</p><p></p><p>Han Jinlong was immediately dissatisfied, "Don't you consider me one of your own?"</p><p></p><p>"It's not that, it's just that the matter is too complicated..." Jiang Wuxin trailed off.</p><p></p><p>Lu Changsheng suddenly said, "You can tell him. In my opinion, it's not a big deal."</p>

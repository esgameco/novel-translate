        <h1>Chapter 355</h1>
        <div class="content">
            <p>Here is the full English translation of the Chinese excerpt:</p><p></p><p>"As for why the human race is the foremost of all tribes? You see..." </p><p></p><p>Afterwards, Han Jinlong recounted the words that Lu Changsheng had spoken that day to Yan Jueyi. </p><p></p><p>Yan Jueyi couldn't help but be surprised, and by the end he was nodding frequently.</p><p></p><p>"How about it? Does the notion that the human race is originally the foremost of all tribes make sense?" Han Jinlong said proudly.</p><p></p><p>"It does." A smile appeared on Yan Jueyi's face: "This Lu friend is an extraordinary person, to have such an earth-shattering viewpoint, and yet his logic is meticulous, with reason behind it that even I, the Saint, find difficult to refute."</p><p></p><p>He suddenly wanted to meet this Lu Changsheng.</p><p></p><p>Not only was his strength not mediocre, but he also had the ability to create realistic dreamscapes with his "Dream-Brewing Liquor", and moreover, he had such a refined perspective.</p><p></p><p>Regardless, this person was indeed extraordinary.</p><p></p><p>For such a remarkable individual to appear among their human race, it was a blessing for the human race.</p><p></p><p>"Anyway, let's not talk about that for now. Although what Lu friend said is reasonable and well-founded, the current state of our human race is still far from being the foremost of all tribes - it's just an illusion. For now, we should focus on seizing the Liuli Heart and getting through the upcoming difficulties."</p><p></p><p>Han Jinlong sighed.</p><p></p><p>"Mm." Yan Jueyi nodded slightly.</p><p></p><p>"Oh right, Saint of Cudgels, you also mentioned the dream you just had. Judging from your state at the time, I'm really curious about it!" Han Jinlong suddenly asked.</p><p></p><p>Yan Jueyi paused, looking deeply at Han Jinlong, hesitating for a moment, just about to speak when a voice came from outside:</p><p></p><p>"Report! Senior Zhao Di requests an audience!"</p><p></p><p>Hm?</p><p></p><p>Han Jinlong was puzzled for a moment, then smiled and said, "Zhao Di, that kid, is here to apologize."</p><p></p><p>"Leave it to the King of Golden Wheel."</p><p></p><p>Yan Jueyi said, slowly disappearing from the seat.</p><p></p><p>He suddenly reappeared and asked, "Is there any more wine?"</p><p></p><p>Han Jinlong spread his hands: "No more!"</p><p></p><p>"Alright." Yan Jueyi sighed.</p><p></p><p>Well, since it's from Lu Changsheng, I'll ask him about it later.</p><p></p><p>As for the bet, the two of them tacitly didn't mention it - a draw wasn't worth discussing, who could have expected that?</p><p></p><p>Seeing Yan Jueyi leave, Han Jinlong called out, "Let him in."</p><p></p><p>"Yes!"</p><p></p><p>After a moment, Zhao Di came before Han Jinlong and knelt down. "King of Golden Wheel, Zhao Di seeks forgiveness!"</p><p></p><p>"What crime have you committed?" Han Jinlong asked in a pretended manner.</p><p></p><p>Zhao Di trembled. In the human domain, even the slightest movement was difficult to escape the ruler's detection, let alone his matter which had caused an uproar throughout the city - he didn't believe the King of Golden Wheel didn't know about it.</p><p></p><p>However, the King of Golden Wheel's pretense of ignorance now clearly indicated that he was angered!</p><p></p><p>"Zhao... Zhao Di..." Zhao Di was panicked, but also deeply regretful.</p><p></p><p>"Alright." </p><p></p><p>Han Jinlong smiled and waved his hand, lifting Zhao Di up with his power. He said softly, "Zhao Di, you are also a core member of our human race, and have been preparing for the Seven-Colored Liuli Pagoda for a long time. Having your spot suddenly replaced, your heart must be unsettled. As the King, I can understand you."</p><p></p><p>Seeing that the King of Golden Wheel didn't blame him, Zhao Di couldn't help but feel moved. He bowed his head and said, "King of Golden Wheel, no matter what, Zhao Di has defied your and the Saint of Cudgels' will. Zhao Di is filled with trepidation..."</p><p></p><p>Han Jinlong's expression darkened slightly. "Enough, enough, stop being so hypocritical with me. Among our human race of hundreds of millions, there are only a hundred or so at the Shen Xuan realm. You are all precious treasures of our human race. As long as you don't make a major mistake, would I really punish you?"</p><p></p><p>"Hehe, understood, thank you King of Golden Wheel!" Zhao Di scratched his head, his heart finally completely relaxed, and a smile appeared on his face.</p><p></p><p>Han Jinlong looked at him amusedly and slowly said, "As for Lu Changsheng, do you still have any dissatisfaction?"</p><p></p><p>"No no no no... Zhao Di dares not!" </p><p></p><p>Zhao Di waved his hands frantically, his face even turning embarrassed red. As someone who had been instantly suppressed, how could he dare to be dissatisfied?</p><p></p><p>Here is the full English translation of the Chinese excerpt:</p><p></p><p>It's so embarrassing, my toes are practically digging into the ground.</p><p></p><p>"Hehe," Han Jinlong smiled slightly, "This Seven-Colored Glazed Pagoda is very important for our human race. The nine Shenxuan Realm experts participating must be the peak combat forces of our human Shenxuan Realm. I hope you understand."</p><p></p><p>Zhao Di bowed and said with a pursed lip, "Your Majesty the Golden Wheel King, rest assured, Zhao Di is not the kind of person who only cares about himself. Everything... must be for the sake of the clan!"</p><p></p><p>"Haha, good! But don't worry, even though you won't be participating in the Seven-Colored Glazed Pagoda this time, I will take you there to watch it in person as compensation."</p><p></p><p>After Han Jinlong said this, Zhao Di was delighted. Being able to watch it in person would of course be excellent!</p><p></p><p>You must know that in the previous Seven-Colored Glazed Pagoda, their human race would usually only send two people in charge, bringing nine Shenxuan Realm experts to participate. The rest were not allowed to go, and had to stay behind to guard the human race!</p><p></p><p>Zhao Di had already imagined the envious gazes of the other Shenxuan Realm experts guarding the Three Cities of Heaven, Earth, and Man.</p><p></p><p>"Hehe hehe..." </p><p></p><p>He couldn't help but break into a silly, blissful smile.</p><p></p><p>"What are you smiling stupidly about?" Han Jinlong frowned and scolded.</p><p></p><p>"Ah, nothing, nothing, Your Majesty the Golden Wheel King, please don't be angry!" Zhao Di hurriedly knelt down in fright.</p><p></p><p>"Alright, since there's nothing, you can leave now, don't disturb my peace." Han Jinlong waved his hand wearily.</p><p></p><p>"Yes..."</p><p></p><p>Zhao Di stood up, just about to turn around, but hesitated for a moment, then respectfully asked, "Your Majesty the Golden Wheel King, Zhao Di has a doubt in his heart..."</p><p></p><p>"Lu Xiaoyou being human is enough, why do you care about the others?" Han Jinlong said indifferently.</p><p></p><p>Zhao Di paused, realizing that the Golden Wheel King knew what he wanted to ask. He quickly paid his respects and left.</p><p></p><p>Han Jinlong shook his head impatiently, then took out a small yellow notebook and started reading.</p><p></p><p>He suddenly had a strange idea: "Since Dream Brewing can create different dreams, I wonder if it can be connected to the Spring Palace Painting..."</p><p></p><p>After carefully studying the Spring Palace Painting for a while, he took a sip of the Dream Brewing and leaned back with his eyes closed, entering the dream realm.</p><p></p><p>Soon, his face flushed red.</p><p></p><p>It works, damn it, he's really a genius!</p><p></p><p>...</p><p></p><p>At the same time,</p><p></p><p>Upon learning of the three participants from the Human City,</p><p></p><p>Whether it was the Savage Sky and Jiang Wuxin from the Earth City, or Jian Wuhui from the Sky City, they were all stunned.</p><p></p><p>Lu... Lu Changsheng?</p><p></p><p>Why does this name sound so familiar?</p><p></p><p>Goodness, isn't that Lu Xiaoyou?</p><p></p><p>He really came after all...</p><p></p><p>Thinking of Lu Changsheng's Eternal Life Body and the watchful Purple Mysterious Yong Five,</p><p></p><p>Savage Sky and Jiang Wuxin were at a complete loss!</p><p></p><p>They had told him not to come, but how come he still came? This Lu Xiaoyou, why doesn't he listen?!</p><p></p><p>It's really strange, during the Eternal Realm, they don't remember giving the route map of the Divine-Demonic Battlefield to Lu Xiaoyou at all.</p><p></p><p>How did he find his way here?</p><p></p><p>Could it be those two Heavenly Lords who gave it to him?</p><p></p><p>"Hey, wait a minute!" </p><p></p><p>Savage Sky suddenly stood up in the Earth City Palace.</p><p></p><p>"Savage King, what's wrong?" Jiang Wuxin asked puzzledly.</p><p></p><p>"Wind Venerable, now that Lu Xiaoyou has obtained a spot in the Human City, won't he naturally become a Shenxuan Realm expert of the Human City? I dare bet that this is definitely a plot by that bastard Golden Wheel King!" </p><p></p><p>Savage Sky said angrily.</p><p></p><p>Jiang Wuxin's expression also changed slightly upon hearing this. He stood up, wanting to pull Savage Sky to the Human City, but seemed to have thought of something and sighed helplessly:</p><p></p><p>"Savage King, the spots for the Seven-Colored Glazed Pagoda have already been determined, and it's known throughout our human territory. Even if we bring Lu Xiaoyou to the Earth City, we can't give him a spot... Ah, we were careless."</p><p></p><p>Savage Sky's face turned gloomy, and he pounded his fists, lamenting bitterly, "Lu Xiaoyou is such a talented genius... This time, he's just handed the benefits to those two fellows! Argh, it makes me so angry!"</p><p></p><p>Jiang Wuxin sighed, he knew who Savage Sky was referring to - Han Jinlong and Yan Jueyi.</p><p></p><p>In fact, his thoughts were a bit different from Savage Sky's. In their eyes, they knew Lu Xiaoyou's situation, and if they could bring him to the Earth City, they could better protect him.</p><p></p><p>Oh well, for now, they should focus their attention on the Seven-Colored Glazed Pagoda. This time, it would be him and Han Jinlong leading the team.</p>

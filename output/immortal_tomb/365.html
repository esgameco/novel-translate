        <h1>Chapter 365</h1>
        <div class="content">
            <p>Here is the full English translation of the Chinese excerpt:</p><p></p><p>Á•ûÊ¥õ (Shenlo) looked at Biqiong with disdain, turning his head and not wanting to deal with him. (-_-) Ôºñ‚ùæùï§ùêáùêÆ–ñ.ùìí‡πèùî™ (-_-)</p><p></p><p>The Seven-Colored Jade Pagoda was imminent, and he had no time to deal with this fellow.</p><p></p><p>It's not that he was afraid, but mainly because this fellow Biqiong was still somewhat troublesome.</p><p></p><p>As the divine son of the Heavenly God Tribe, apart from his father, who else would he fear on this divine-demonic battlefield?</p><p></p><p>The gaze in Biqiong's hard and bristly hair flickered, and he no longer pursued relentlessly, still needing to give Shenlo some face.</p><p></p><p>The various alien tribes here were silent and just quietly watched the Versailles between the peak great clans.</p><p></p><p>Fortunately, the team leaders of the ten peak great clans were all holy sons and holy daughters, after all, the strength of these holy sons and holy daughters was extremely powerful, enough to control the situation.</p><p></p><p>For example, Shenlo, Biqiong, Aoxi ng, Fengjun, Bai Qianmo, Xuanshan, these six were all on the individual combat power ranking.</p><p></p><p>As for the other four, although they were slightly weaker than the former, they were also infinitely close to the individual combat power ranking.</p><p></p><p>One can imagine, this time at the Seven-Colored Jade Pagoda, if the clan leaders of the peak great clans were to arrive, the pressure they would exert would be so great!</p><p></p><p>Next, the holy sons and holy daughters of the ten peak great clans, after chatting with each other for a few sentences, fell silent in their respective places.</p><p></p><p>Just like the myriad tribes, they waited silently for the opening of the Seven-Colored Jade Pagoda.</p><p></p><p>With the peak great clans present, all the alien tribes here dared not speak up again.</p><p></p><p>On the human tribe side, Lu Changsheng surveyed the holy sons and holy daughters of the ten peak great clans, and finally, his gaze rested on Shenlo, with a somewhat inexplicable expression.</p><p></p><p>He transmitted a voice: "The Heavenly God Tribe seems to be about the same as the human tribe... This is their original form, except for a pair of white light wings, they are really no different from the human tribe."</p><p></p><p>Jiang Wuxin and Han Jinlong paused, not understanding what Lu Changsheng meant.</p><p></p><p>Just as the two were about to ask, a thunderous sound suddenly came from in front of the Seven-Colored Jade Pagoda!</p><p></p><p>Hum hum hum!!</p><p></p><p>Instantly, the members of the myriad tribes were all energized.</p><p></p><p>A virtual great dao extended from the gate of the Seven-Colored Jade Pagoda!</p><p></p><p>Jiang Wuxin quickly explained to Lu Changsheng:</p><p></p><p>"Fellow Daoist Changsheng, this is the sensing barrier for entering the Seven-Colored Jade Pagoda, only for the Shenxuan realm, higher or lower won't work!"</p><p></p><p>"Once, a Shenyou realm expert of the myriad tribes tried to sneak in, but ended up being annihilated on this great dao..."</p><p></p><p>Han Jinlong also said solemnly, "Yes, a Shenyou expert was annihilated in an instant, just thinking about it is terrifying. Since then, no one in the myriad tribes has dared to try to sneak through."</p><p></p><p>Jiang Wuxin and Han Jinlong had solemn expressions, wondering if even they would die in there.</p><p></p><p>Lu Changsheng nodded his head, his expression calm.</p><p></p><p>Then he wanted to try it out... He planned to put down all his means and just go in and see how the sensing barrier would react.</p><p></p><p>At this time, Shenlo swept his gaze across the crowd and said indifferently:</p><p></p><p>"The old rule, the order of entry of the myriad tribes into the Seven-Colored Jade Pagoda is from low to high, and they shall wait in place after entering the pagoda."</p><p></p><p>This rule was jointly formulated by the myriad tribes, with the purpose of ensuring fairness and ensuring that all myriad tribe members entered before the competition for the Jade Heart began.</p><p></p><p>So, the last to enter would naturally be the peak great clans.</p><p></p><p>"Yes."</p><p></p><p>Instantly, all the myriad tribe members slightly bowed towards Shenlo.</p><p></p><p>Shenlo nodded in satisfaction, looking at Biqiong, Aoxi ng and other holy sons and holy daughters of the peak great clans, and said, "Gentlemen, shall we begin?"</p><p></p><p>Aoxi ng and the others nodded.</p><p></p><p>"Good, then... enter the pagoda."</p><p></p><p>Shenlo waved his hand lightly and said, "Which tribe is the last among the myriad tribes?"</p><p></p><p>The scene suddenly became a bit awkward.</p><p></p><p>Everyone had some impression of the last tribe...</p><p></p><p>Seemed to be called the Fly Tribe?</p><p></p><p>Soon, an elder with an unperturbed expression walked out and stood in front of the virtual great dao.</p><p></p><p>"Hiss? Isn't this the Fly Tribe's clan leader?"</p><p></p><p>"Yes, it should be. The entire Fly Tribe seems to have only the clan leader at the Shenxuan realm, and he's at the initial stage."</p><p></p><p>"Ah, such a weak race, what are they coming to this divine-demonic battlefield for?"</p><p></p><p>"But it's strange, the tribes at the bottom of the myriad tribe ranking are all doing fine."</p><p></p><p>Here is the full English translation of the Chinese excerpt:</p><p></p><p>"What's the matter? So weak, according to reason......"</p><p></p><p>"Haha, you're overthinking it. For a small tribe like the Fly Tribe, even slightly stronger foreign tribes can't be bothered to target them. Normally, it's just these small tribes at the bottom of the Myriad Tribe Ranking fighting amongst themselves."</p><p></p><p>"I see, how pitiful and laughable..."</p><p></p><p>"......"</p><p></p><p>The foreign tribes present looked at the Fly Tribe Chief in front of the gate, with a mixture of mockery, pity, and a hint of admiration.</p><p></p><p>The Fly Tribe Chief, without a word, bowed to Shenlo and the others, then strode into the Illusory Path, step by step disappearing from the many gazes.</p><p></p><p>Lu Changsheng transmitted a voice and chuckled, "This Fly Tribe Chief, though from a small tribe at the bottom, carries himself with more grace than many higher-ranked races."</p><p></p><p>Han Jinlong and Jiang Wuxin exchanged a glance, their lips slightly pursed.</p><p></p><p>They didn't know how to explain it.</p><p></p><p>Or one could say, this is the mentality of the barefoot who don't fear those who wear shoes?</p><p></p><p>Since they can't get any worse, they feel at ease in their hearts?</p><p></p><p>Immediately after, the tribes at the bottom one by one entered the Seven-colored Jade Tower.</p><p></p><p>Most of them, like the Fly Tribe Chief, were the tribal chiefs going in alone.</p><p></p><p>Their cultivation was mostly at the initial stage of the Shenxuan Realm, with the better ones at the middle stage.</p><p></p><p>They were considered powerful experts on the Divine-Demonic Battlefield, but as tribal chiefs, they were a bit lacking.</p><p></p><p>They came here just to try their luck, to see if they could obtain a Jade Heart.</p><p></p><p>They dared not hope for more, as obtaining a Jade Heart was as difficult as ascending to the heavens for them.</p><p></p><p>But if they could seize a Jade Heart, their tribe might gain a Shenxuan Realm cultivator, and their tribe's ranking would definitely rise significantly.</p><p></p><p>Lu Changsheng quietly watched these small tribal chiefs enter, lost in thought.</p><p></p><p>As time passed, wave after wave of foreign tribe teams entered the Seven-colored Jade Tower.</p><p></p><p>And the Illusory Path remained uneventful.</p><p></p><p>Due to the lack of any abnormalities, everything proceeded smoothly, and soon there were eight or nine thousand foreign tribe teams that had entered the Seven-colored Jade Tower.</p><p></p><p>Now it was the Human Tribe's turn, and countless gazes turned towards them, full of deep meaning.</p><p></p><p>Han Jinlong and Jiang Wuxin suddenly became nervous.</p><p></p><p>"Fang Yin, you all will listen to Lu Nan after entering," Jiang Wuxin instructed solemnly.</p><p></p><p>"Yes, Venerable Wind Xing," Fang Yin and the others hurriedly obeyed. They naturally had no objections, as they knew Lu Changsheng's status.</p><p></p><p>Han Jinlong, seeing the tense expressions of the crowd, comforted them with a smile, "Don't be nervous. The Jade Hearts are secondary, your lives are the most important. Understand?"</p><p></p><p>"We understand!" Fang Yin and the others immediately responded, though their hearts grew even more anxious. They really didn't want to disappoint the two Human Tribe leaders.</p><p></p><p>"Why are the Human Tribe dawdling? Don't they know there are many more teams waiting behind?" At this moment, the Heavenly God Tribe's Shenlo coldly spoke.</p><p></p><p>"Yes, yes, yes, Divine Son, they are entering now. We've finished instructing them," Han Jinlong hurriedly apologized with a smile.</p><p></p><p>Fang Yin, Mo Liangqiu, and the others didn't dare to delay any further, and immediately turned to walk towards the Illusory Path!</p><p></p><p>Lu Changsheng, with his hands behind his back, leisurely followed behind them.</p><p></p><p>As for Zhao Di, he naturally stayed by the side of Jiang Wuxin and Han Jinlong.</p><p></p><p>"Huh? Lu Nan?" Ao Xing suddenly let out a surprised sound, his gaze filled with confusion as he looked at Lu Changsheng.</p><p></p><p>He, he was at the Shenxuan Realm, coming to participate in the Seven-colored Jade Tower?</p><p></p><p>What was the situation he had encountered on the way before?</p><p></p><p>"Holy Son Ao Xing, what's wrong?" Phoenix Clan's Feng Jun noticed Ao Xing's unusual behavior and couldn't help but ask curiously.</p><p></p><p>"Nothing." Ao Xing lightly shook his head, but his gaze remained fixed on Lu Changsheng's back.</p><p></p><p>Feng Jun followed Ao Xing's line of sight and also saw Lu Changsheng, her eyes filled with curiosity.</p><p>Why did this Shenxuan Realm Human Tribe member attract Ao Xing's attention?</p><p></p><p>Fang Yin, Mo Liangqiu, and the other eight people all entered smoothly, and the sensing barrier did not react abnormally.</p><p></p><p>Until the last one, Lu Changsheng, stepped into the barrier...</p><p></p><p>The previously calm sensing barrier suddenly experienced a change!</p>

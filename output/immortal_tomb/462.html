        <div class="content">
            <p>Here is the full English translation of the Chinese excerpt:</p><p></p><p>Two days later.</p><p></p><p>At the Ye Clan, the elder Ye Nantian had gathered all the elders for a meeting.</p><p></p><p>"Less than half a month remains before the He Clan completes the refinement of the Millennium Calamity Body. The medium-sized ancient clans around our Ye Clan's territory should have already been integrated, right?" </p><p></p><p>Ye Nantian swept his gaze around the room and spoke in a solemn tone.</p><p></p><p>"Reporting to the Clan Leader, the integration has already been completed. We only need your order to mobilize them," one of the elders immediately responded.</p><p></p><p>Ye Nantian nodded slightly, then suddenly let out a light sigh. "This time... the situation is not optimistic. I hope the esteemed elders can do a good job with the ideological work among our clan's younger generation."</p><p></p><p>"Clan Leader need not worry. Not a single member of our clan has retreated. They all hold the resolve to share the same fate as the Ye Clan," another elder said in a deep voice.</p><p></p><p>Ye Nantian's eyes showed relief, and he was about to continue speaking when his expression suddenly changed, and he abruptly stood up!</p><p></p><p>The Ye Clan elders were puzzled by this, but in the next moment, a sense of foreboding arose in their hearts. Could it be...?</p><p></p><p>Ye Nantian's face turned grim as he shouted: </p><p></p><p>"The Hong Clan has sent an emergency transmission! The He Clan is preparing to begin the refinement of the Millennium Calamity Body today! Elders, quickly go down and strike the clan bell nine times, then transmit the order of the Clan Leader. Have the high-level combat forces of those medium-sized ancient clans gather at the Ye Clan as soon as possible!"</p><p></p><p>"Yes!"</p><p></p><p>The elders bowed and quickly left with solemn expressions.</p><p></p><p>Ye Nantian watched them leave, his gaze heavy as he walked out.</p><p></p><p>"Dong, dong, dong, dong..."</p><p></p><p>Soon, nine muffled bell tolls resounded within the Ye Clan, echoing across the land.</p><p></p><p>All the members of the Ye Clan were startled and looked towards the source of the bell tolls.</p><p></p><p>Nine tolls - this meant the gathering of the entire clan! </p><p></p><p>Vaguely, everyone guessed the reason and couldn't help but pale in expression, their expressions becoming tense.</p><p></p><p>Immediately, all the Ye Clan members put down what they were doing and hurried towards the gathering point.</p><p></p><p>...</p><p></p><p>At the Offering Hall.</p><p></p><p>"Nine tolls, it's actually nine tolls. Elder, the clan bell tolling nine times means that a grave event that threatens the safety of the entire clan is about to happen. Could it be the He Clan...?"</p><p></p><p>Ye Feng clenched his fists as he explained.</p><p></p><p>"Of course it's because of the He Clan." Lu Changsheng stood up and walked out, hands behind his back. "Let's go."</p><p></p><p>"Yes."</p><p></p><p>Ye Feng looked at the figure in blue robes, and remembering the words from a few days ago, he felt both worry and a hint of anticipation...</p><p></p><p>...</p><p></p><p>When Lu Changsheng arrived at the gathering place, he saw that the Ye Clan members had already assembled. As far as the eye could see, it was a vast and imposing sight.</p><p></p><p>In the front were the Ye Clan elders, executives, and Ye Xunwang was among them.</p><p></p><p>At the very front, Ye Nantian, Ye Zhuiyue, and Ye Zhuixing noticed Lu Changsheng's arrival, their eyes flashing.</p><p></p><p>"Nantian, this is..." Ye Zhuiyue asked with a flickering gaze, clearly surprised by Lu Changsheng's presence.</p><p></p><p>Ye Nantian quickly explained, "Venerable Ancestor, Elder, I suddenly remembered that two months ago I had asked Elder Lu, and Elder Lu said that he would also go to the He Clan."</p><p></p><p>Oh?</p><p></p><p>Ye Zhuiyue and Ye Zhuixing exchanged a surprised glance, their eyes showing relief. Their gaze towards Lu Changsheng became increasingly amiable.</p><p></p><p>Ye Zhuiyue and Ye Zhuixing promptly stepped forward and greeted him with cupped fists.</p><p></p><p>"Elder Lu, you're here..."</p><p></p><p>Ye Nantian also hurriedly approached. "Elder Lu, you've come."</p><p></p><p>At this moment, the gazes of countless Ye Clan members converged on Lu Changsheng. Among them, some Ye Clan members who had interacted with Lu Changsheng before couldn't help but murmur:</p><p></p><p>"Who would have thought that Elder Lu would come too... He's the Offering Hall Elder, so this matter with the He Clan must be no simple affair. If I were Elder Lu with the status of the Offering Hall Elder, I might just stand by and watch."</p><p></p><p>"Hehe..."</p><p></p><p>Here is the full English translation of the Chinese excerpt:</p><p></p><p>"Well, you're just an ordinary disciple, while Elder Lu is a revered elder. Not only is the gap in strength and status immense, but the scope and vision are also completely on different levels."</p><p></p><p>"Huh, are you mocking me? I'm just speaking objectively. I didn't say anything, did I? Wouldn't that make you appreciate Elder Lu's goodness even more?"</p><p></p><p>"Elder Lu is truly wonderful. I had the privilege of conversing with him briefly, and I could tell that he is a kind-hearted and powerful figure."</p><p></p><p>"Ah, isn't it strange? I don't feel nervous at all when I see Elder Lu."</p><p></p><p>"Hmm, now that you mention it, I feel the same way."</p><p></p><p>...</p><p></p><p>At the same time, Lu Changsheng looked at Ye Zhuiyue and Ye Zhuixing and smiled, "Why are you two acting so unexpectedly? Don't you welcome me?"</p><p></p><p>Ye Zhuiyue scanned Lu Changsheng up and down for a moment, then suddenly bowed slightly:</p><p></p><p>"Elder Lu, your actions have deeply moved and impressed me. Please accept this salute from this old man."</p><p></p><p>"However..."</p><p></p><p>Ye Zhuiyue suddenly changed his tone:</p><p></p><p>"However, Elder Lu's great righteousness makes me feel unworthy to let you continue to take on such risks. You have only been serving as an elder in our Ye Clan for two months, and now you are asked to risk your life. To be honest, I and the entire Ye Clan feel ashamed and undeserving, so Elder Lu, it's best if you leave as soon as possible!"</p><p></p><p>If Lu Changsheng had not appeared, Ye Zhuiyue might have had a somewhat natural idea, but he wouldn't have said anything.</p><p></p><p>But now that Lu Changsheng had appeared, Ye Zhuiyue felt ashamed.</p><p></p><p>Reflecting inwardly, having an apex expert at the Spirit Void Realm in the Ye Clan would naturally improve their situation.</p><p></p><p>However, Lu Changsheng's actions had truly moved him.</p><p></p><p>Beside him, Ye Nantian was stunned to hear his ancestor Ye Zhuiyue ask Lu Elder to leave. Previously, the ancestor had said Ye Nantian was not suitable to be the clan leader, but now the ancestor was doing this?</p><p></p><p>The Ye Clan disciples also never expected their ancestor to ask Lu Elder to leave. Pushing away an apex expert at the Spirit Void Realm? Who would do that?</p><p></p><p>However, the Ye Clan disciples not only did not blame Ye Zhuiyue for this, but they felt their ancestor had become even more admirable in their eyes. This was their Ye Clan, a clan with an upright conscience.</p><p></p><p>Lu Changsheng's brow furrowed slightly as he waved his hand, "I won't be leaving for now, so you don't need to say more. But rest assured, if the situation becomes unfavorable, I will find a way to escape."</p><p></p><p>Hearing this, Ye Zhuiyue felt even more moved. Without any pretense, he led Ye Zhuixing and Ye Nantian in a slight bow, "Thank you, Elder Lu."</p><p></p><p>Afterward, they invited Lu Changsheng to stand with them in the front, and Ye Zhuiyue gestured to Ye Nantian.</p><p></p><p>Ye Nantian immediately understood, stepped forward, and addressed the many Ye Clan disciples, shouting:</p><p></p><p>"As you all know the reason, I, the Clan Leader, will not say more. I only know that our Ye Clan has no cowards! Great Elder!"</p><p></p><p>"Here!" The Great Elder stepped forward and bowed.</p><p></p><p>"What did those middle-ancient clans say?" Ye Nantian asked.</p><p></p><p>The Great Elder quickly replied, "Reporting to the Clan Leader, those middle-ancient clans have already constructed a transmission array and are waiting at a location a million miles northeast of our Ye Clan!"</p><p></p><p>Ye Nantian's gaze turned towards the northeast, which was also the direction of the He Clan, and then he waved his hand grandly:</p><p></p><p>"Depart!!"</p>

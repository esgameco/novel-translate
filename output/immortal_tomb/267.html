        <h1>Chapter 267</h1>
        <div class="content">
            <p>Here is the full English translation of the Chinese excerpt:</p><p></p><p>Looking at the timid young girl in front of him, a conjecture slowly emerged in Xing Tian's mind, and this conjecture became increasingly clear.</p><p></p><p>Thinking of that conjecture, his heart couldn't help but tremble a little.</p><p></p><p>At this time, Lu Changsheng stood up and walked out of the clinic, "Xing Tian, come with me."</p><p></p><p>"Yes, Senior Lu." Xing Tian paused, looked at Xiao Tong deeply, and then followed him out.</p><p></p><p>The others looked at each other in bewilderment.</p><p></p><p>...</p><p></p><p>Outside the clinic.</p><p></p><p>Xing Tian walked behind Lu Changsheng with a furrowed brow, deep in thought.</p><p></p><p>Suddenly, Lu Changsheng stopped, turned around and looked at him, "That is your daughter."</p><p></p><p>Xing Tian's body shook, and he suddenly looked up!</p><p></p><p>He said in disbelief, "Is that really Tong'er?"</p><p></p><p>Lu Changsheng nodded slightly, "That's right."</p><p></p><p>Xing Tian's face flushed red, filled with joy but also feeling very flustered.</p><p></p><p>In over 300 million years, this was the first time he had seen his awakened daughter.</p><p></p><p>"Senior Lu, I..." Xing Tian hesitated.</p><p></p><p>Lu Changsheng smiled slightly, "Speak your mind."</p><p></p><p>"May I stay in your clinic for a while?" Xing Tian looked at Lu Changsheng hopefully.</p><p></p><p>He was not stupid, he knew his daughter was undergoing tribulation, and they could not be recognized, or it would inevitably lead to undesirable consequences.</p><p></p><p>Now he just wanted to stay in the clinic for a while.</p><p></p><p>"Okay."</p><p></p><p>"Thank you, Senior!"</p><p></p><p>Xing Tian was delighted.</p><p></p><p>Lu Changsheng waved his hand and said, "Did you see those few people in the clinic just now?"</p><p></p><p>Xing Tian paused, the images of Chu Lingyan and the others flashing in his mind, and he nodded.</p><p></p><p>"Those few are the Immortal Emperors of the Four Directions Immortal Realm, and they have already ascended to the Ancestral Heavenly Realm." Lu Changsheng smiled.</p><p></p><p>Xing Tian's expression changed, from surprise to anger.</p><p></p><p>Well, when he inquired about this matter with the Godking Palace before, he was actually lied to. It turned out that the Immortal Emperors of the Four Directions Immortal Realm had already ascended.</p><p></p><p>How dare they lie to him!</p><p></p><p>Unfortunately, Ye Wutian's Godking Palace had already been destroyed, hmph.</p><p></p><p>He knew that Lu Changsheng had once served as an Immortal Emperor in the Central Immortal Realm, and he immediately understood.</p><p></p><p>He then cupped his hands and promised,</p><p></p><p>"Senior Lu, rest assured, I will report the matter of those Immortal Emperors to the Immortal Emperor, and they will definitely be arranged properly!"</p><p></p><p>Xing Tian knew that as long as he reported this matter to the Immortal Emperor, the Immortal Emperor would definitely give those people high positions.</p><p></p><p>After all, it was because of Lu Changsheng.</p><p></p><p>...</p><p></p><p>Xiao Tong has been feeling very uncomfortable lately.</p><p></p><p>That black-armored man always looks at her intentionally or unintentionally, and gets close to her.</p><p></p><p>The two are not even familiar, yet the black-armored man keeps coming to make awkward conversation.</p><p></p><p>This has been going on for a while, and the black-armored man is finally leaving.</p><p></p><p>Leaving with him are Chu Lingyan, Shi Wushi, and the others.</p><p></p><p>Outside the clinic.</p><p></p><p>Lu Changsheng and the others stood.</p><p></p><p>Xing Tian's gaze shifted from behind Lu Changsheng to He Xitong, and he cupped his hands and said, "Senior Lu, I shall take my leave now."</p><p></p><p>Behind him, Chu Lingyan and the others bowed down.</p><p></p><p>During this period, they had already heard Xing Tian talk about their trip to the Immortal Emperor's Palace.</p><p></p><p>It can be said that their future is very bright.</p><p></p><p>And all of this is because of the Longevity Immortal Emperor.</p><p></p><p>"We bid farewell to the Longevity Immortal Emperor!"</p><p></p><p>Chu Lingyan and the others respectfully kowtowed and sincerely exclaimed.</p><p></p><p>Why say "bid farewell"? Because they knew in their hearts that, given Lu Changsheng's carefree nature, he would not stay long in the Ancestral Heavenly Realm.</p><p></p><p>The Longevity Immortal Emperor might leave very soon.</p><p></p><p>After today, they probably won't have much chance to see him again in the future.</p><p></p><p>Lu Changsheng smiled slightly, "Go."</p><p></p><p>The group stood up.</p><p></p><p>Xing Tian glanced at He Xitong and then turned and left.</p><p></p><p>Since he knows this place, he will definitely come to visit often in the future.</p><p></p><p>"Master, let me see off Lingyan and the others."</p><p></p><p>The old turtle bowed and said with a smile, then went over and put his arms around them.</p><p></p><p>"Wushi, in the past period, thank you for your support. You must come and visit us from time to time in the future..."</p><p></p><p>"Ah, don't worry, don't worry. Wushi, why are your eyes still red?"</p><p></p><p>Here is the full English translation of the Chinese excerpt:</p><p></p><p>The crowd disappeared from sight, some chatting and laughing.</p><p></p><p>.........</p><p></p><p>Two years later.</p><p></p><p>Li Shuyan came to the medical clinic, but found only Old Turtle and Tong Xin sitting there drinking tea. He couldn't help but ask, "Where is Senior Lü?"</p><p></p><p>Both Tong Xin and Old Turtle, who had already sensed someone entering, looked over and were taken aback.</p><p></p><p>This young man in the ink-black robe and long hair... Jinguan?</p><p></p><p>Old Turtle quickly went over and pulled Li Shuyan to a seat, asking curiously, "Oh ho, so you're not a monk anymore?"</p><p></p><p>Li Shuyan smiled, "No, not anymore."</p><p></p><p>Ever since he had passed through the Ninth Tribulation, he no longer wanted to be a monk.</p><p></p><p>Tong Xin poured him a cup of tea. "The master has taken Little Tong out to collect herbs, he should be back in a few days."</p><p></p><p>Li Shuyan held the cup, feeling the warmth in his palms. "Thank you."</p><p></p><p>Tong Xin chuckled and scratched his head. He found that Jinguan no longer being a monk made him much more agreeable to look at. He didn't know why, perhaps it was because he no longer spoke in a Buddhist tone.</p><p></p><p>"What shall we call you from now on?" Old Turtle asked.</p><p></p><p>"Li Shuyan, from now on there is no more Jinguan in this world."</p><p></p><p>.........</p><p></p><p>The Endless Demonic Abyss.</p><p></p><p>Dense fog rolled, obscuring all sight.</p><p></p><p>Lü Changsheng walked on the damp ground, with Little Tong carrying a basket of herbs behind him.</p><p></p><p>Little Tong was completely dumbfounded at the moment, terribly afraid. This place was heavy with demonic energy, clearly not a good place.</p><p></p><p>"This place is rarely trodden by humans, but there are many precious and rare medicinal herbs. Take the opportunity to collect as many as you can, as a reserve," Lü Changsheng said softly.</p><p></p><p>Hearing this, Little Tong's eyes flickered, and she tightened her grip on the herb basket behind her. "Master, are you about to leave Yanyuzhen soon?"</p><p></p><p>Lü Changsheng gazed at the misty fog, sighing, "Yes, I'll be leaving soon."</p><p></p><p>With a wave of his sleeve, the fog suddenly surged away in all directions, revealing the scene before them.</p><p></p><p>Scattered white bones and remains were strewn everywhere, making Little Tong's scalp tingle.</p><p></p><p>However, when she saw the swaying grasses and plants in the pits and hollows, her eyes lit up.</p><p>She instantly recognized many of them, as they were recorded in the herbal books.</p><p></p><p>Many of the herbs here were extremely precious, not even found in the master's own clinic.</p><p></p><p>"What are you spacing out for? Shall I come collect the herbs for you?" Lü Changsheng glanced sideways at Little Tong.</p><p></p><p>Little Tong coughed lightly, hurriedly going over to collect the herbs.</p><p></p><p>Lü Changsheng's gaze swept over the silent depths of the Demonic Abyss. Ever since he had dispersed the fog, something from the depths of the Abyss had been approaching them.</p><p>The demonic beasts of the Endless Demonic Abyss.</p><p></p><p>.........</p><p></p><p>"Someone dares to enter our Endless Demonic Abyss?"</p><p></p><p>"Hmm, there's only one aura, seems to be... a mortal?"</p><p></p><p>"Impossible, a mortal could disperse the fog for miles around?!"</p><p></p><p>"...Let's go take a look."</p><p></p><p>In the fog, two figures conversed as they swiftly traversed the area.</p><p></p><p>Soon, they emerged from the fog, the scene before them now clear.</p><p>With their keen eyesight, they could clearly see the silhouette of a young man standing there.</p><p></p><p>Their gazes focused intently, quickly approaching that direction.</p><p></p><p>Sensing this, Little Tong straightened up with the herb basket on her back, looking puzzledly at the two young men approaching.</p><p>Huh, aside from her and the master, there were other people here?</p><p></p><p>"Continue collecting the herbs," Lü Changsheng's voice sounded in her ear.</p><p></p><p>Little Tong immediately stopped paying attention to the two young men, and went back to collecting herbs.</p><p></p><p>At this moment, </p><p>the gazes of the two young men had long since shifted from Little Tong, fixed intently on Lü Changsheng, their expressions grave.</p><p></p><p>Just now, in their sensing, they had only detected the aura of that mortal girl. But upon arriving, they found there was also this young man in blue robes.</p><p>Even now, facing this young man, his aura was murky and difficult to gauge...</p><p>He must be a powerful expert.</p>

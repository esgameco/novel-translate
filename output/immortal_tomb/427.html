        <h1>Chapter 427</h1>
        <div class="content">
            <p>Here is the full English translation of the Chinese excerpt:</p><p></p><p>The East Gate has been reopened and order has been restored.</p><p></p><p>Aside from Yun Zeqing and the others, no one in the capital city knows what happened.</p><p></p><p>As for Lu Changsheng and the old turtle, they have been invited to the palace by Yun Zeqing and the others.</p><p></p><p>Inside the palace.</p><p></p><p>Lu Changsheng is leading the way.</p><p></p><p>By Lu Changsheng's side, Yun Zeqing is smiling as he personally introduces Lu Changsheng to the various things in the palace.</p><p></p><p>Behind them are the old turtle, Ye Xunwang, Yun Aoye, and the rest of the officials silently following.</p><p></p><p>Wherever they pass, whether it's the guards, the imperial guards, the eunuchs, or the palace maids, they all kneel on the ground, filled with trepidation and awe.</p><p></p><p>Who is this unfamiliar young man in blue robes leading the way? </p><p></p><p>Why is he being personally accompanied by the King, who represents the highest authority of the ancient Kingdom of Yunlan, and the officials?</p><p></p><p>The earlier descent of the King and the officials at the East Gate had been widely discussed throughout the capital city. Could it be that they were there to welcome this young man in blue?</p><p></p><p>About half an incense stick's worth of time later, the group arrives at the main hall.</p><p></p><p>The main hall is where Yun Zeqing often holds court, an extremely important place.</p><p></p><p>"My lord, this is the usual place where I and the officials hold discussions..."</p><p></p><p>Before Yun Zeqing could finish the introduction, Lu Changsheng waved his hand and said, "Just arrange a place for me to rest."</p><p></p><p>Yun Zeqing paused, then quickly looked at the officials and said, "You all go ahead to the hall, I will take the lord there myself."</p><p></p><p>Yun Zeqing's implication was that he wanted to personally take Lu Changsheng there.</p><p></p><p>Just as the officials hurriedly bowed and prepared to enter the hall, Lu Changsheng smiled and shook his head, "You go first, just have him lead the way."</p><p></p><p>Lu Changsheng then looked at Yun Aoye.</p><p></p><p>Yun Aoye immediately stood up straight!</p><p></p><p>Seeing this, Yun Zeqing could only nod and say, "Aoye, take the lord to the best accommodation."</p><p></p><p>"Yes, father king!"</p><p></p><p>After Yun Aoye bowed in acknowledgment, he carefully looked at Lu Changsheng and asked, "My lord, shall I lead the way?"</p><p></p><p>Lu Changsheng nodded slightly.</p><p></p><p>Yun Aoye then led the way, and Lu Changsheng and the old turtle followed closely behind, soon disappearing from Yun Zeqing and the others' sight.</p><p></p><p>"Brother, since I saw this lord, even without you saying anything, I feel that he is extraordinary. This bearing and demeanor are truly not that of an ordinary person."</p><p></p><p>Yun Zeqing looked at the direction Lu Changsheng left, sighing.</p><p></p><p>The officials also nodded in unison, indeed, no matter how, this aura is something that cannot be faked.</p><p></p><p>That young man in blue, facing the ruler of the ancient Kingdom of Yunlan and these distinguished officials, was not the least bit intimidated. Instead, his gaze was indifferent, as if looking at ants.</p><p></p><p>Under that indescribable aura, all the officials felt an inexplicable sense of nervousness in their hearts.</p><p></p><p>"Hehe," Ye Xunwang chuckled and said, "Your Majesty, you don't know, what impresses me most about the lord in blue is his qin playing skills. His qin playing skills are unparalleled, without precedent in history."</p><p></p><p>Qin playing skills? Unparalleled, without precedent in history?</p><p></p><p>These were the words of Qin master Ye Xunwang?</p><p></p><p>Not only Yun Zeqing, but all the officials were stunned.</p><p></p><p>They all knew very well how superb Ye Xunwang's qin playing skills were, and Ye Xunwang had always been proud of his own skills, never admitting to being surpassed by anyone.</p><p></p><p>Seeing the expressions of the others, Ye Xunwang didn't feel embarrassed at all. Instead, he took out his guqin and ruefully said, "Your Majesty, look at these strings, they were all snapped in a brief contest with the lord in blue that I didn't even know about..."</p><p></p><p>Ah?</p><p></p><p>Yun Zeqing and the officials looked at the guqin in Ye Xunwang's hand, and were indeed shocked to see that all the strings were broken!</p><p></p><p>Whew!</p><p></p><p>This is unbelievable!</p><p></p><p>Ye Xunwang put away the guqin and sighed, "So..."</p><p></p><p>Here is the full English translation of the Chinese excerpt:</p><p></p><p>"From now on, don't call me the 'Qin Saint' anymore, I'm unworthy of that title."</p><p></p><p>Hearing Ye Xunwang say this, the crowd was eager and really wanted to hear the gentleman in the green robe play a piece.</p><p></p><p>But alas, it was not to be.</p><p></p><p>"Ahem, younger brother, your return is timely. Let's first go to the main hall to discuss the important matters."</p><p></p><p>Yunze Cang suddenly remembered something, his expression turning gloomy.</p><p></p><p>The officials all lowered their heads.</p><p></p><p>Ye Xunwang's eyes flashed, as if he had guessed something, and he nodded slightly.</p><p></p><p>...</p><p></p><p>In the main hall.</p><p></p><p>Yunze Cang sat above, while Ye Xunwang was seated beside him.</p><p></p><p>The officials stood humbly below the dais.</p><p></p><p>"Younger brother, how do you see this matter?"</p><p></p><p>Yunze Cang looked at Ye Xunwang and asked.</p><p></p><p>Ye Xunwang's face was expressionless. Earlier outside the hall, he had already guessed what was going on, and now that Yunze Cang had finished speaking, it was indeed as he had expected.</p><p></p><p>"Your Majesty, the ancient country of Fengluan, we cannot provoke them."</p><p></p><p>Ye Xunwang said solemnly.</p><p></p><p>Yunze Cang's brow furrowed, and he immediately understood the implication of Ye Xunwang's words. He felt a sense of frustration and suddenly waved his sleeve angrily:</p><p></p><p>"Then are we really going to send Princess Kening to Fengluan?!"</p><p></p><p>Kening had lost her mother since she was young, and the other princes and princesses had always been at odds with her. So among the princesses, Yunze Cang had always doted on Kening the most.</p><p></p><p>In the past, the Crown Prince of Fengluan had come to visit the ancient country of Yunlan, and by chance had met Kening. Yunze Cang had then noticed that the Crown Prince seemed to have some hidden feelings for Kening.</p><p></p><p>Sure enough, a few years after the Crown Prince returned to Fengluan, the ruler of Fengluan sent a message to Yunze Cang, saying they wished to form a marriage alliance.</p><p></p><p>At the time, Yunze Cang had not realized the implications, and even thought that an alliance with Fengluan would be good for improving relations between the two countries.</p><p></p><p>Until the other side said the chosen bride was Kening, Yunze Cang's face immediately turned ashen and he flatly refused!</p><p></p><p>Yunze Cang also recalled the Crown Prince of Fengluan, and after reviewing the details, he guessed that it must have been the Crown Prince's idea.</p><p></p><p>That Crown Prince of Fengluan had definitely pestered his father relentlessly for two years after returning home.</p><p></p><p>After Yunze Cang's refusal, enmity had arisen between the ancient countries of Yunlan and Fengluan.</p><p></p><p>In recent years, there had been constant minor wars between the two.</p><p></p><p>Originally the two countries were evenly matched in strength, so Yunze Cang had dared to refuse directly without any courtesy.</p><p></p><p>But recently, Fengluan had somehow found a top-tier expert at the Spirit Realm level to defend them!</p><p></p><p>They had directly threatened that if Yunlan did not agree to the marriage alliance, they would launch an all-out war between the two countries!</p><p></p><p>No more small skirmishes as before!</p><p></p><p>Yunze Cang's eyes reddened as he swept his gaze over the officials and coldly snapped, "Does it mean the ancient country of Yunlan has fallen to the point of having to rely on a princess marriage alliance just to barely survive?!"</p><p></p><p>At this juncture, even if it was not Kening, even if it was another princess, Yunze Cang would find it very difficult to agree. This was now a matter of face and dignity!</p><p></p><p>Moreover, they specifically demanded his most beloved Kening?</p><p></p><p>The people of Yunlan did not yet know the specifics of the situation, only that there were conflicts with Fengluan.</p><p></p><p>If the princess were to marry into Fengluan, the people would inevitably be able to guess the details, and then the royal family would likely lose all face.</p><p></p><p>To put it bluntly, the entire nation's people would feel it unacceptable that their princess had to be married off to achieve peace, how weak and pitiful that would be.</p>

        <h1>Chapter 336</h1>
        <div class="content">
            <p>Here is the full English translation of the Chinese excerpt:</p><p></p><p>The eyes of the people in the Chiyang Palace suddenly sharpened, and the Grand Elder stared solemnly at the man in blue robes!</p><p></p><p>A... Daoist Immortal?</p><p></p><p>"Sect Master!!"</p><p></p><p>Peng Fang and the other Xiaoliao Sect disciples were shocked and hurriedly paid their respects. Tong Xin and Lin Dong were extremely excited - with the Sect Master's involvement, today's matter would no longer be a problem.</p><p></p><p>Huh? This person is the Sect Master of the Xiaoliao Sect?</p><p></p><p>The elder of the Chiyang Palace's eyes flickered, but he still did not feel too much panic in his heart.</p><p></p><p>So what if he is a Daoist Immortal realm expert?</p><p></p><p>Not to mention that the life of the Sect Elder of their sect is currently in his hands right now, more importantly, he believes that the other party definitely fears the Chiyang Palace and would not dare to make a big fuss about this!</p><p></p><p>"Hehe, so you are the Sect Master of the Xiaoliao Sect? Perhaps the actions of the Chiyang Palace today were a bit presumptuous..."</p><p></p><p>But before the elder of the Chiyang Palace could finish speaking, Yin Jiudui coldly interrupted:</p><p></p><p>"Nonsense, how is this presumptuous? We of the Xiaoliao Sect came here, and you said this is your Chiyang Palace's territory. Didn't we say we were willing to compensate? </p><p></p><p>But you made an outrageous demand, asking for our sect's core cultivation technique. Isn't that insatiably greedy! After being rejected by me and the Second Elder, you immediately resorted to violence without a second thought!!"</p><p></p><p>What?! </p><p></p><p>They actually wanted the Xiaoliao Technique?!</p><p></p><p>The executive disciples of the Xiaoliao Sect were all shocked, staring unbelievably at the elder of the Chiyang Palace.</p><p></p><p>Seeing this, the elder of the Chiyang Palace lowered his head, his expression gloomy for a moment, then he ignored Yin Jiudui and looked at Lu Changsheng with a smile:</p><p></p><p>"Sect Master of the Xiaoliao Sect, as they say, 'no fight, no acquaintance'. This old man admits that our actions today were a bit excessive. How about this, this old man will release your Sect Elder, and we can just let this matter go?"</p><p></p><p>Even though he knew the Sect Master of the Xiaoliao Sect before him was a Daoist Immortal expert, he was still confident!</p><p></p><p>Upon hearing this, the members of the Xiaoliao Sect had extremely unsightly expressions, but the fact was that their Second Elder, Su Qianghe, was still in the other party's hands.</p><p></p><p>Today, unless they were willing to disregard Su Qianghe's life, it would be very difficult to kill this elder of the Chiyang Palace.</p><p></p><p>"Let it go?" Lu Changsheng smiled slightly, "Why do you think I would agree to just let it go?"</p><p></p><p>Hearing the Sect Master speak, the members of the Xiaoliao Sect watched intently, as for the current situation, they were helpless and did not know what the Sect Master...</p><p></p><p>"Hehe." The elder of the Chiyang Palace smiled benevolently, slowly saying, "Sect Master of the Xiaoliao Sect, I'm sure you don't want to offend our Chiyang Palace, especially since your Sect Elder is still in my hands..."</p><p></p><p>"And then?" Lu Changsheng asked calmly.</p><p></p><p>The elder of the Chiyang Palace's expression changed slightly, being straightforward, this Sect Master of the Xiaoliao Sect, although appearing calm and indifferent on the surface, made him inexplicably feel an increasing sense of pressure!</p><p></p><p>"And then naturally..."</p><p></p><p>"Crawl over here."</p><p></p><p>But before the elder of the Chiyang Palace could finish speaking, he was interrupted by Lu Changsheng!</p><p></p><p>Crawl over?</p><p></p><p>The elder of the Chiyang Palace's face flushed with anger, how dare this Sect Master of the Xiaoliao Sect insult him!</p><p></p><p>But at that moment, he felt his four limbs lose control, and the hand strangling Su Qianghe's neck also stiffened and loosened. He suddenly felt a sense of terror rise in his heart, and he looked up at Lu Changsheng with a horrified gaze!</p><p></p><p>Afterwards, the elder of the Chiyang Palace, under the horrified gaze of everyone present, slowly prostrated on the ground and crawled towards Lu Changsheng.</p><p></p><p>"G-Grand Elder..."</p><p></p><p>The members of the Chiyang Palace were all bewildered by this scene, they looked unbelievably at the crawling Grand Elder.</p><p></p><p>But at this moment, the heart of the elder of the Chiyang Palace was already filled with fear!</p><p></p><p>He wanted to stop himself, stop this humiliating action, but no matter how hard he tried, he was powerless to do so!</p><p></p><p>His mind had never been as clear as it was at this moment.</p><p></p><p>Here is the full English translation of the Chinese excerpt:</p><p></p><p>Clearly knowing what a shameful act he was committing!</p><p></p><p>New 69 Book Bar â†’ 69shux.com</p><p></p><p>In the old man of the Crimson Sun Palace's perception, a Deity Realm expert could never do such a thing, not even those stronger than Deity Realm!</p><p></p><p>Just a casual remark made him lose control of his own body......</p><p></p><p>This bizarre technique was beyond his comprehension.</p><p></p><p>A devil...a devil!!</p><p></p><p>As for the people of the Carefree Sect, they were also petrified, staring blankly at the Crimson Sun Palace's Grand Elder who was obediently listening like a dog.</p><p></p><p>This late-stage Deity Realm expert, who was utterly helpless against them, was now like an insect in the hands of the Sect Master.</p><p></p><p>Soon, the Crimson Sun Palace's Grand Elder crawled in front of Lu Changsheng, maintaining a prostrate position, unable to even lift his head to look at Lu Changsheng.</p><p></p><p>He wanted to speak, but couldn't, as if his mouth was sealed by something.</p><p></p><p>Lu Changsheng, with his hands behind his back, looked down at the old man groveling like a dog, his face still bearing a gentle smile.</p><p></p><p>The next moment, he lightly raised a foot and stepped on him.</p><p></p><p>Grinding the old man's head into the ground, while gently grinding, he said:</p><p></p><p>"What are you?"</p><p></p><p>The Crimson Sun Palace's Grand Elder's ears were ground to shreds, the bleeding never stopping, the blood even flowing into his eye sockets, turning his world blood-red!</p><p></p><p>His pupils shrank violently, his mouth trembling uncontrollably!</p><p></p><p>He had offended a big shot......</p><p></p><p>There was one thing he couldn't quite understand - why was the overall strength of the Carefree Sect so mediocre, yet they had such a powerful Sect Master behind them?</p><p></p><p>The two middle-aged stewards and young disciples of the Crimson Sun Palace were now shivering all over, having lost all color in their faces...they were terrified.</p><p></p><p>Boom!</p><p></p><p>Suddenly, Lu Changsheng lightly stepped with his toes, and the Crimson Sun Palace's Grand Elder's head exploded.</p><p></p><p>All the vitality within him disappeared completely under this one step, leaving no chance of survival.</p><p></p><p>The people of the Crimson Sun Palace were immediately thrown into complete disarray, not even knowing where they were for a moment.</p><p></p><p>"Peng Fang, clean up these people, I'm going to pay a visit to the Crimson Sun Palace."</p><p></p><p>Lu Changsheng said lightly, then disappeared.</p><p></p><p>"Respectfully seeing off the Sect Master!"</p><p></p><p>The Carefree Sect members regained their senses and hurriedly paid their respects.</p><p></p><p>After the ceremony, Left Qiushan and the others quickly went to support the barely conscious Su Qianghe.</p><p></p><p>"Third Elder, how are you?"</p><p></p><p>"Haha...I'm...I'm fine..." Su Qianghe forced a smile, still feeling the excruciating pain in his abdomen, that punch from the Crimson Sun Palace's Grand Elder was too vicious.</p><p></p><p>"You're lucky this time, if the Sect Master hadn't arrived, you would have been in real danger today." Left Qiushan sighed.</p><p></p><p>Su Qianghe bitterly smiled, full of reverence, he had just seen clearly how extraordinary the Sect Master was, it could only be described as bizarre.</p><p></p><p>"Third Elder, how are you?"</p><p></p><p>At this time, Peng Fang looked at Su Qianghe and asked indifferently.</p><p></p><p>Su Qianghe swallowed, his heart warming, this time he realized that although the Grand Elder was not on good terms with him, he still cared about him in critical moments.</p><p></p><p>"Grand Elder, I'm fine."</p><p></p><p>"Hmph, if you can't handle it, don't force it. Second Elder, take him down to recuperate." Peng Fang ordered, then swept his gaze over all the people present and sternly shouted, "All of you go and cultivate hard! We can't always rely on the Sect Master to come to our rescue! What if the Sect Master is not around?"</p><p></p><p>"Yes..." Immediately, the Carefree Sect's stewards and disciples hurriedly paid their respects and quickly retreated.</p><p></p><p>Peng Fang then looked at the trembling Crimson Sun Palace people left behind, a ruthless light flashing in his eyes.</p>

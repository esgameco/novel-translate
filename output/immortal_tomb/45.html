        <h1>Chapter 45</h1>
        <div class="content">
            <p>Here is the full English translation of the Chinese excerpt:</p><p></p><p>Tiger Battle appeared on a mountain peak. </p><p></p><p>He stared intently in the direction of the immortal tomb on the mountain ridge, his pupils slightly constricted......</p><p></p><p>Could it be an illusion?</p><p></p><p>That ordinary-looking turtle suddenly gave him a sense of unease in that moment.</p><p></p><p>Thinking about it carefully now, that person named Lu Changsheng also seemed a bit off.</p><p></p><p>He didn't seem nervous at all when facing Tiger Battle, remaining calm and indifferent. Especially that sentence "Or perhaps not of this world?"</p><p></p><p>It made Tiger Battle feel a terrifying sense that his true nature had been seen through.</p><p></p><p>It doesn't make sense.</p><p></p><p>Tiger Battle furrowed his brows tightly.</p><p></p><p>But through this trip, he has come to know that the waters of the Spiritual Dust Realm run deep.</p><p></p><p>As well as the mysterious disappearance of the immortal tomb,</p><p></p><p>Thinking about it, Jie Wuqing delaying the time of the attack was not wrong either.</p><p></p><p>"Lu Changsheng... This person, I should discuss him with Jie Wuqing, have her pay attention."</p><p></p><p>Tiger Battle murmured, then waved his large hand in the void in front of him!</p><p></p><p>The next moment, a chaotic light ring appeared before him.</p><p></p><p>"Tiger Battle?" </p><p></p><p>Jie Wuqing's puzzled voice came from the light ring.</p><p></p><p>"Jie Wuqing, I just went to the immortal tomb and found that... an immortal tomb has indeed disappeared there." Tiger Battle looked at the light ring and said in a serious tone.</p><p></p><p>"You don't think I'm fooling you, do you? If you just want to tell me this, then I won't entertain you." Jie Wuqing said indifferently from the other end.</p><p></p><p>"Wait, there's more I need to tell you!" Seeing Jie Wuqing wanting to cut off the communication, Tiger Battle's tone became a bit anxious.</p><p></p><p>Seeing no sound coming from the light ring, Tiger Battle knew Jie Wuqing was waiting for him to continue.</p><p></p><p>So he said in a slightly solemn tone, "This time I went to the immortal tomb, I encountered a cultivator!"</p><p></p><p>Jie Wuqing: "Can you just say it all at once?"</p><p></p><p>"Okay." Tiger Battle sighed slightly, then said, "Jie Wuqing, you don't know, that cultivator..."</p><p></p><p>After that, Tiger Battle described to Jie Wuqing the details of his encounter with Lu Changsheng and their conversation.</p><p></p><p>"An unfathomable realm Lu Changsheng? And a turtle that gave you a sense of unease?" Jie Wuqing asked suspiciously.</p><p></p><p>For some reason, Tiger Battle always felt that Jie Wuqing seemed to be mocking him, so he blushed and shouted, "Jie Wuqing! I'm telling you seriously, don't think I'm joking with you! That turtle really gave me a sense of... unease!"</p><p></p><p>Jie Wuqing was silent for a long time, as if pondering the words Tiger Battle had just said, then said, "Okay, let's not talk about the turtle first. You said that Lu Changsheng was always calm and indifferent? Even when you asked about the disappeared tomb, he didn't show any surprise?"</p><p></p><p>Tiger Battle's eyes narrowed: "That's right, he was always very calm, and even questioned whether I had remembered it wrong. In the end, he just said he had an answer in his heart and didn't need to ask further."</p><p></p><p>Jie Wuqing was silent for a long time again, then asked, "And when you discovered him, where was he standing in the immortal tomb?"</p><p></p><p>Tiger Battle was taken aback: "The first time I saw him, he seemed to be standing in front of the disappeared immortal tomb..."</p><p></p><p>Seeing Jie Wuqing still not responding, Tiger Battle couldn't help but say, "This time I just want to tell you to be careful about this person. This person gives me a very strange feeling, I've never even heard of such a person in the cultivation world."</p><p></p><p>Jie Wuqing still didn't respond.</p><p></p><p>Tiger Battle said, "Now can we talk about that turtle? I tell you, that turtle is definitely not normal..."</p><p></p><p>"No need, I have my own thoughts." Jie Wuqing said.</p><p></p><p>Here is the full English translation of the excerpt from the Chinese novel:</p><p></p><p>"There are some things that need to be clarified, as for the turtle, you can think about it yourself." </p><p></p><p>After saying this, Jiwuqing cut off the connection on the other end.</p><p></p><p>On this side, Huzhang blankly watched the chaotic light circle in front of him gradually dissipate. </p><p></p><p>He then waved his sleeve, frowning and cursing, "What the hell, how unlucky!"</p><p></p><p>...</p><p></p><p>Qingyun Sect.</p><p>The main hall.</p><p></p><p>"Elder Gu sent a message saying that this matter should be reported to all the sects and factions in the cultivation world..." </p><p></p><p>Shen Miaojun said calmly from the hall.</p><p></p><p>As soon as she said this, the remaining elders in the sect were stunned, and then they started discussing.</p><p></p><p>"What is Helin up to? Five years ago, I already said we should inform the cultivation world, but he refuted it. This time, however..."</p><p></p><p>"The senior elder is absolutely right, I don't know what Elder Gu is thinking."</p><p></p><p>"Sect Master, did Elder Gu say why? He can't just say something and have it be so, without a proper reason, we won't agree."</p><p></p><p>"That's right, does Elder Gu know the exact time of the demonic invasion? If not, we won't agree! If we spread this news, our Qingyun Sect will become a laughingstock! Won't our friends mock us in the future?"</p><p></p><p>"......"</p><p></p><p>Seeing the dissatisfied elders, Shen Miaojun sighed, "Elder Gu said that if we don't release the news, when the demonic invasion comes... due to the lack of prior preparation in the cultivation world, the common people may suffer extremely heavy casualties."</p><p></p><p>The hall fell silent.</p><p>The elders frowned deeply.</p><p></p><p>Soon, the Senior Elder stood up and said, "Sect Master, based on Helin's idea from five years ago, even if we say it, there will be very few sects willing to believe it! In the end, how will our Qingyun Sect establish a foothold in the cultivation world?"</p><p></p><p>The other elders nodded in agreement.</p><p></p><p>Shen Miaojun coldly smiled, "But if we don't say it, when the time comes, the common people will suffer heavy casualties. Can you all live with that?"</p><p></p><p>"How can we not live with it?!"</p><p></p><p>At this time, an elder with a flushed face stood up and said, "Sect Master, not to be rude, but why do we have to be so responsible for the common people? As cultivators, we can help if we can, and if we can't, it doesn't matter. Why should we feel guilty?"</p><p></p><p>"Hmm?" Shen Miaojun's expression changed slightly, and she stared intently at that elder.</p><p></p><p>The atmosphere in the hall became cold, and the other elders fell silent like cicadas in winter.</p><p></p><p>Although they didn't say anything, they secretly agreed with the view of this elder.</p><p></p><p>"Foolish!" Shen Miaojun said in a stern voice, "Leaving aside the common people, based on what Elder Gu has said, the demonic and evil realms have a high possibility of forming an alliance. When that time comes, even if we don't help the secular world, do you think our Qingyun Sect can safely escape? That's the demonic and evil realms we're talking about!"</p><p></p><p>"The demonic and evil realms are plotting to seize the immortal tombs. When that time comes, the first to be destroyed may not be the common people, but us - the Qingyun Sect that governs this secular world!"</p><p></p><p>After her words, the expressions of the elders finally changed.</p><p></p><p>"Sect Master, should we relocate the sect and move far away from the Eastern Domain?"</p><p></p><p>An elder asked cautiously.</p><p></p><p>"Slap!"</p><p></p><p>Shen Miaojun picked up a teacup and slammed it heavily in front of him, coldly scolding, "Nonsense! How can you say such a thing?"</p><p></p><p>"Sect Master, please calm down!"</p><p></p><p>The elders immediately knelt down. They hadn't seen Shen Miaojun this angry in a long time.</p><p></p><p>"Should I call the Ancestor, who is still in seclusion, or should our sect do it?"</p><p></p><p>"The Qingyun Sect has been passed down here for a long time. How can you simply abandon it?"</p><p></p><p>"The surrounding secular empires have been paying tribute every year, and even the cultivation talents are selected from among them. How can you heartlessly abandon them?"</p><p></p><p>The elders lowered their heads, not daring to speak.</p><p></p><p>Shen Miaojun said indifferently, "No need for further discussion. You all go and spread the news. Whatever number of sects believe it, that's their own business. As long as our Qingyun Sect has a clear conscience!"</p><p></p><p>"Yes..."</p><p></p><p>The elders stood up, paid their respects, and retreated out of the hall, bowing their heads.</p>

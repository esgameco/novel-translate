        <h1>Chapter 478</h1>
        <div class="content">
            <p>Here is the full English translation of the excerpt from the Chinese novel:</p><p></p><p>The waves continued to crash and splash.</p><p></p><p>On the deck of the Sea Voyage No. 3, the crowd remained stiff, unable to recover from the previous slaughter.</p><p></p><p>The entire fleet of nine ships of the sea demonic cultivators had actually been slaughtered, and so easily at that!</p><p></p><p>Suddenly, Lu Changsheng waved his sleeve, and a dazzling array of treasures piled up on the deck.</p><p></p><p>"Take back your own belongings."</p><p></p><p>After saying that, Lu Changsheng returned to the corner and sat down cross-legged.</p><p></p><p>The crowd stared blankly at the various treasures on the deck, each seeing the items that originally belonged to them, but no one stepped forward to retrieve them.</p><p></p><p>"Great... great lord, these worldly possessions cannot be compared to one's life. You saved my life, so these worldly possessions are my humble offering to express my gratitude for your lifesaving grace."</p><p></p><p>At this time, a cultivator stepped forward, bowing deeply towards Lu Changsheng and speaking very sincerely.</p><p></p><p>As soon as this cultivator spoke, the rest of them also hastily expressed their opinions:</p><p></p><p>"Yes, great lord, although with your status and position, you may not value these, but these are our meager token of appreciation!"</p><p></p><p>"Great lord, we are grateful for the lifesaving grace, please accept them!"</p><p></p><p>"..."</p><p></p><p>Lu Changsheng raised his gaze and swept it across the crowd, seeing through their thoughts quite clearly.</p><p></p><p>He possessed the power to crush these cultivators, which was why they were acting this way. </p><p></p><p>If his strength was on par with, or even slightly inferior to these cultivators, they would never be so generous and grateful.</p><p></p><p>Humans are all selfish and self-interested, let alone these cunning and calculating cultivators.</p><p></p><p>According to the customs of the cultivation world, Lu Changsheng could have rightfully kept these treasures without returning them.</p><p></p><p>Because logically, the treasures were first robbed by the sea demonic cultivators, and then the sea demonic cultivators were killed by Lu Changsheng, so the treasures naturally belonged to him.</p><p></p><p>However, Lu Changsheng did not value these things at all, considering them to be mere rubbish.</p><p></p><p>Lu Changsheng closed his eyes and said indifferently, "I'll say it one last time, take back your own belongings."</p><p></p><p>Seeing this, Chen Pang and Xiao Chai could only bow towards Lu Changsheng, then step forward to retrieve their own meager possessions.</p><p></p><p>In fact, Chen Pang and Xiao Chai were truly grateful to Lu Changsheng, but they felt their own possessions were insignificant.</p><p></p><p>And although they hadn't known Lu Changsheng for long, they had seen from the previous slaughter that he was a person of his word, unwavering in his decisions.</p><p></p><p>If they didn't retrieve their own things now, they might lose them for good.</p><p></p><p>The cultivators watched this scene, glaring disapprovingly at Chen Pang and Xiao Chai, as if saying, "You two, how can you be so lacking in propriety? You've only been asked a few times, and you couldn't hold back from taking back your things?"</p><p></p><p>No matter what, they should have tried their best to express their gratitude, shouldn't they? They should have pushed it a few more times before taking back the treasures, as the saying goes, "Things don't happen more than three times."</p><p></p><p>But the cultivators were soon shocked to discover that even the two elven maidens had stepped forward to retrieve their own belongings after bowing to Lu Changsheng.</p><p></p><p>The cultivators felt very uncomfortable about this.</p><p></p><p>So the cultivators no longer paid attention to Chen Pang and Xiao Chai, or the two elven maidens, and continued to sincerely plead:</p><p></p><p>"Great lord, please just accept them. If you don't, we will be restless day and night."</p><p></p><p>"Yes, great lord, our treasures were originally robbed by the sea demonic cultivators, and then you killed them. Even if you don't want them, according to the customs, these treasures should belong to you."</p><p></p><p>"Great lord..."</p><p></p><p>The cultivators expressed their attitude with the utmost sincerity.</p><p></p><p>This time, the cultivators...</p><p></p><p>Here is the full English translation of the Chinese excerpt:</p><p></p><p>The cultivators were prepared to take back their own belongings after Lu Changsheng refused, but at this moment, Lu Changsheng had already grown impatient. He did not want to waste his energy on the false human relationships, and he said indifferently:</p><p></p><p>"Don't want it? Then don't take any of it."</p><p></p><p>As soon as he spoke, Lu Changsheng casually waved his sleeve, and all the precious treasures on the deck were instantly swept into the vast sea, as if by a raging wind.</p><p></p><p>The group of cultivators were instantly petrified, filled with disbelief, regret, frustration, and bitterness! Even Chen Pang and Xiao Chai were dumbfounded. They had vaguely guessed, but they never imagined that Lord Lu would simply discard so many treasures like trash into the sea...</p><p></p><p>The two young elven ladies were also shocked, their mouths slightly agape, stealing glances at Lu Changsheng. They had never seen a man with such a strong personality before.</p><p></p><p>The cultivators were somewhat suffocated, gazing at the deep sea, deeply regretting. If only they had taken the treasures, for that was their entire wealth.</p><p></p><p>The cultivators fell silent, of course not daring to blame Lu Changsheng, but a forced smile appeared on their faces.</p><p></p><p>"My lord, to throw away so many valuables into the sea, is it not a bit too wasteful..."</p><p></p><p>At this time, a cultivator with a severely imbalanced mentality and rationality mustered up the courage to chuckle, but the laughter sounded quite awkward.</p><p></p><p>The other cultivators were surprised to see this person, obviously not expecting anyone to have such bravery. However, some of them also sighed inwardly in empathy, but did not dare to express it.</p><p></p><p>Lu Changsheng's brow furrowed slightly, then relaxed. He turned his head to look at the man and a smile appeared at the corner of his mouth.</p><p></p><p>"You're right, it is quite wasteful..."</p><p></p><p>But before the cultivator could say anything, Lu Changsheng's smile suddenly disappeared, and he said indifferently, "But it's my own thing, I can do whatever I want with it. What's it to you?"</p><p></p><p>At this time, the cultivator's body suddenly shivered, his mind instantly cleared, and he trembled as he lowered his head, "I-I'm sorry..."</p><p></p><p>But the next moment, his head flew up into the air, with a gush of blood!</p><p></p><p>This sudden scene terrified the cultivators, and they all quickly knelt down, not daring to move.</p><p></p><p>They could not imagine the mental torment they were experiencing at the moment. To kill without blinking an eye, to kill without blinking an eye!</p><p></p><p>Lu Changsheng leaned against the railing, calmly looking at the cultivators.</p><p></p><p>"Does anyone else have any opinions?"</p><p></p><p>The cultivators frantically shook their heads, wishing they could shake their heads off to express that they dared not have any more opinions.</p><p></p><p>Lu Changsheng said no more, leaning against the railing and closing his eyes to rest.</p><p></p><p>It was a while before the cultivators dared to shakily stand up from the ground and carefully return to their original positions, with some retreating to their luxurious suites.</p><p></p><p>Seeing this, the captain signaled to the crew with a glance and returned to the cabin to prepare to restart the Sea Transport No. 3.</p><p></p><p>As the Sea Transport No. 3 began to vibrate, a column of light suddenly burst forth from the stern formation, and the ship shot out rapidly.</p><p></p><p>Witnessing Lu Changsheng's power, Chen Pang and Xiao Chai naturally did not dare to approach him again, and the two found a spot on the deck.</p><p></p><p>The space around Lu Changsheng, about ten meters wide, seemed to have become a vacuum field, with no one daring to approach!</p>

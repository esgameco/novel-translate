        <h1>Chapter 58</h1>
        <div class="content">
            <p>Here is the full English translation of the Chinese excerpt:</p><p></p><p>Boom!</p><p></p><p>The Ancient Crane Forest fell from the sky. üéÅ‚¨áÔ∏è69sùïôœÖùïè.‚í∏‡πèùêå‚ôüüòæ</p><p></p><p>Although the old turtle helped relieve his strength, he was still seriously injured, the injury from the thunderbolt.</p><p></p><p>The Ancient Crane Forest's body was torn and tattered, he opened his mouth weakly, his eyes filled with despair.</p><p></p><p>The golden elixir within him was about to dissolve, but he was powerless against the last wave of thunderbolts.</p><p></p><p>The tribulation he had to endure was the Forty-Nine Heavenly Tribulation, something he never imagined.</p><p></p><p>The Ancient Crane Forest collapsed on the ground, turning his head to look at Lu Changsheng standing with his hands behind his back, and forced a bitter smile:</p><p></p><p>"Sir... I never expected the Forty-Nine Heavenly Tribulation to appear, and I'm afraid I won't be able to withstand the last wave. I've troubled you to protect me today, sir, please go."</p><p></p><p>After saying this, he closed his eyes while lying on the ground, having no strength left, his spiritual energy exhausted.</p><p></p><p>Although there was a defensive formation in this place, it would be impossible to block the fourth wave of thunderbolts, and he really had no strength left, not even the energy to move a finger.</p><p></p><p>He knew what he was about to face.</p><p></p><p>Death.</p><p></p><p>"This last wave of thunderbolts, won't you pass through it?" Lu Changsheng asked lightly, looking at the rolling tribulation clouds above.</p><p></p><p>The Ancient Crane Forest opened his mouth but could not utter a word, completely exhausted.</p><p></p><p>He thought Lu Changsheng wanted to help him,</p><p></p><p>but throughout history, thunderbolt tribulations cannot be interfered with. If someone intervened, the consequences would be unimaginable!</p><p></p><p>The one who tried to help would surely suffer a devastating blow!</p><p></p><p>Lu Changsheng shook his head and openly flicked a wisp of energy into the Ancient Crane Forest's body, saying, "Pass through this wave of thunderbolts, and you will be reborn."</p><p></p><p>"Sir, don't!" The Ancient Crane Forest was stunned, but soon he was horrified to feel the revival of spiritual energy within him, and the various injuries were being repaired at a terrifying speed!</p><p></p><p>He looked up at the sky in terror, but saw that the tribulation clouds did not react at all, as if they had not noticed Lu Changsheng's actions.</p><p></p><p>How is this possible...</p><p></p><p>"Go, I can help you this much, but the rest of the thunderbolt tribulation you must pass through yourself," Lu Changsheng said calmly.</p><p></p><p>"Thank you, sir!" The Ancient Crane Forest suddenly stood up and rushed towards the sky.</p><p></p><p>But at that moment!</p><p></p><p>A cold laughter rang out.</p><p></p><p>"Hehe, I was wondering which Transcendent Immortal Lord was undergoing tribulation, turns out it's the Ancient Immortal of the Qingyan Sect. Reaching the Gold Core and immediately summoning the Forty-Nine Heavenly Tribulation, impressive."</p><p></p><p>As the words fell,</p><p></p><p>Zhao Shenyuan appeared in the distant sky, first looking at the tribulation clouds with trepidation, then a mocking smile appeared on his face.</p><p></p><p>The Ancient Crane Forest's face changed drastically: "Demon King Zhao Shenyuan!"</p><p></p><p>Zhao Shenyuan looked at the tribulation clouds ready to erupt, and smiled, </p><p></p><p>"Hurry and pass through the tribulation, after you're done, I'll kill you... But I'm afraid you'll just die in the thunderbolts, that would be a real pity, I have to say your luck is quite bad."</p><p></p><p>"Hehe, your luck is indeed quite bad," the old turtle below also said with a smile on his face.</p><p></p><p>Zhao Shenyuan's expression darkened, his gaze suddenly shooting towards the ground, and his pupils slightly narrowed.</p><p></p><p>He hadn't noticed the other two people earlier!</p><p></p><p>It seems these two must be the ones protecting the Ancient Crane Forest.</p><p></p><p>Before he could investigate further,</p><p></p><p>Rumble...</p><p></p><p>The tribulation clouds suddenly churned, lightning flashing.</p><p></p><p>"Focus on passing through the tribulation, don't worry about the rest," Lu Changsheng said calmly.</p><p></p><p>"Understood!" The Ancient Crane Forest heaved a sigh of relief and no longer paid attention to Zhao Shenyuan.</p><p></p><p>Zhao Shenyuan looked deeply at Lu Changsheng and the old turtle, his eyes narrowing.</p><p></p><p>The next moment, nine faint purple lightning bolts suddenly descended!</p><p></p><p>The Ancient Crane Forest's eyes flashed with madness, a ruthless energy bursting forth as he charged towards them!</p><p></p><p>Boom--!</p><p></p><p>After the earth-shattering explosion, a black shadow fell from the sky again...</p><p></p><p>The old turtle saw this and sighed helplessly, once again catching this surnamed Ancient. He didn't know how many times he had helped this person pass through such a thunderbolt tribulation.</p><p></p><p>The Ancient Crane Forest's left arm was torn off, his body covered in blood, but his mind was now very clear.</p><p></p><p>He looked inwardly at the small figure within him that resembled him, unable to help but feel hot.</p><p></p><p>New 69 book bar 69shux.com</p><p></p><p>Here is the full English translation of the Chinese excerpt:</p><p></p><p>Tears welled up in his eyes.</p><p></p><p>After going through countless tribulations and dangers, he had finally overcome the dreaded Forty-Nine Heavenly Tribulation and ascended to the Nascent Soul realm!</p><p></p><p>However, at this moment, he was extremely weak and unable to fully feel the difference.</p><p></p><p>At this time, the ominous clouds in the sky rapidly dissipated, as if they were fleeing.</p><p></p><p>The sky had cleared up again.</p><p></p><p>Zhao Shenyuan suddenly appeared before Gu Helin, looking down at him indifferently, "You have overcome the Forty-Nine Heavenly Tribulation, which is quite impressive, but unfortunately... you still have to die."</p><p></p><p>Just then, a talisman suddenly appeared in Gu Helin's hand and began to burn, and a child's anxious voice was heard!</p><p></p><p>"Master, your disciple sees that the ominous clouds have dissipated, have you successfully overcome the tribulation? Many demonic creatures have appeared in Moyu Town, killing and injuring many townspeople!"</p><p></p><p>The talisman quickly burned out.</p><p></p><p>"You..." Gu Helin's eyes widened with anger.</p><p></p><p>"Angry? Don't be in a hurry to get angry. I have a question for you. Eight years ago, who took my Abyss Demon Spear?"</p><p></p><p>Zhao Shenyuan asked coldly.</p><p></p><p>He could clearly sense that the Abyss Demon Spear was somewhere near this small town, but he couldn't pinpoint its exact location, which puzzled him greatly.</p><p></p><p>"Is this it?" The old turtle said, raising his hand, and the Abyss Demon Spear appeared in his hand.</p><p></p><p>"My Abyss Demon Spear!" Zhao Shenyuan was first delighted, but soon his expression became solemn as he stared at the old turtle: "It was you!"</p><p></p><p>"Give it to me." Lu Changsheng stretched out his hand.</p><p></p><p>The old turtle smiled and handed the Abyss Demon Spear to Lu Changsheng, then stood by and watched the show. "Of course, it's not your grandpa turtle."</p><p></p><p>Lu Changsheng felt the trembling of the Abyss Demon Spear in his hand and said indifferently, "After eight years, your master... has finally come to save you."</p><p></p><p>Hearing this, the Abyss Demon Spear trembled even more violently.</p><p></p><p>Zhao Shenyuan sensed the Abyss Demon Spear's estrangement from him, and his expression changed as he stared fixedly at Lu Changsheng!</p><p></p><p>"Go back to your master."</p><p></p><p>Lu Changsheng loosened his grip, and the Abyss Demon Spear hovered in the air, trembling, but did not fly towards Zhao Shenyuan.</p><p></p><p>This scene left Zhao Shenyuan feeling chilled to the bone.</p><p></p><p>Damn it, he had once taken the Abyss Demon Spear and drank a vast amount of fresh blood, but now, after only eight years, it had actually become estranged from him?</p><p></p><p>Zhao Shenyuan's eyes turned icy, and he suddenly raised his hand towards the Abyss Demon Spear!</p><p></p><p>The Abyss Demon Spear then uncontrollably flew back into his hand, but it was still trembling, trying to break free from his palm!</p><p></p><p>"Damn it, I had already refined it, but now I can't seem to control it completely!" Zhao Shenyuan was filled with raging fury.</p><p></p><p>He then abruptly looked up and stared at Lu Changsheng with a cold expression, "What did you do to my Abyss Demon Spear?!"</p><p></p><p>He had just summoned the Abyss Demon Spear back with a single gesture, which meant it still recognized him as its master. He also didn't believe the person in front of him had the ability to erase his imprint from the Abyss Demon Spear.</p><p></p><p>Lu Changsheng did not answer, but instead clapped his hands, took out a persimmon, and said while eating it,</p><p></p><p>"Your Demon Lord just saw me yesterday, and you come to attack me today. What, didn't she tell you to be more careful?"</p><p></p><p>Demon Lord...</p><p></p><p>Not only Zhao Shenyuan, but even Gu Helin suddenly looked up, staring at Lu Changsheng in astonishment, involuntarily swallowing their saliva...</p><p></p><p>After interacting with him, they no longer believed that this gentleman was the simple Transcendent Cultivator they had imagined.</p><p></p><p>The impression he gave them was that he was becoming increasingly mysterious, far beyond what they had previously thought.</p><p></p><p>Zhao Shenyuan angrily pointed the trembling Abyss Demon Spear at Lu Changsheng and sneered,</p><p></p><p>"The Demon Lord has seen you? Then how are you still alive? Haha, anyone can boast, if you're scared, just say so!"</p>

        <h1>Chapter 158</h1>
        <div class="content">
            <p>Here is the full English translation of the Chinese excerpt:</p><p></p><p>"But no matter what, Father and the Imperial Clan will have a final battle, even if it means death."</p><p></p><p>Zuo Choushan laughed again: "Except for my son whom I have never met, the Imperial Clan can be said to have nothing to do with me. What about you? That's your maternal grandfather and grandmother after all..."</p><p></p><p>"And, to go against the Imperial Clan, Father knows the outcome will be most tragic, so... Qi Ran, you can forget about becoming the Young Master of the Tian She Manor, just focus on staying alive, that is the righteous path."</p><p></p><p>Zuo Qi Ran's gaze trembled, she did not expect things to turn out this way. All these years, she had been resentful that Zuo Choushan passed the position of Young Master to Zuo You, but now she realized...</p><p></p><p>It was only because Zuo Choushan did not want to involve her.</p><p></p><p>"Father... Father, I don't know what maternal grandfather and grandmother are, from the moment they abandoned me, they ceased to be my maternal grandparents."</p><p></p><p>Zuo Qi Ran said slowly.</p><p></p><p>Hearing this form of address that he had not heard in a long time, Zuo Choushan paused, then sighed: "Although your bloodline is mixed, you still have the blood of the Imperial Clan... I tell you this today, not for any reason, but because I can no longer suppress the urge to confess, I don't want our father-daughter relationship to continue to deteriorate."</p><p></p><p>Zuo Qi Ran asked: "Father has not told Qi Ran what Imperial Clan it is?"</p><p></p><p>Zuo Choushan frowned and said, "It doesn't matter what Imperial Clan it is, it has nothing to do with you."</p><p></p><p>"They let Qi Ran have no maternal love since birth, how can it have nothing to do with Qi Ran? If Father does not tell, Qi Ran will hate you for the rest of her life."</p><p></p><p>Zuo Qi Ran said flatly.</p><p></p><p>Zuo Choushan's expression changed slightly, and he sighed solemnly: "The Jiang Clan Imperial Clan, your mother's name is Jiang Xuan."</p><p></p><p>Jiang Clan Imperial Clan, Jiang Xuan... Zuo Qi Ran murmured in her heart, lowering her head in silence.</p><p></p><p>Zuo Choushan pursed his lips and also slowly closed his eyes.</p><p></p><p>...</p><p></p><p>As the sun set, night fell again.</p><p></p><p>After seeing off the last batch of satisfied customers, Tongxin and the two people sent them off, saying in unison,</p><p></p><p>"The Washing Soul Brew of the tavern today has been sold out, but don't worry, the waiting list has been recorded. Please help inform those who have left, and they don't need to queue up outside the tavern anymore, they can just come to register during the day."</p><p></p><p>The cultivators understood, politely cupping their hands and leaving one by one.</p><p></p><p>Since the list has been recorded, they can just come when it's their turn.</p><p></p><p>Soon, the outside of the tavern became empty, with only Tongxin and the others.</p><p></p><p>Tongxin and Lin Dong smiled at Zuo Choushan and Zuo Qi Ran, then went into the courtyard and closed the gate.</p><p></p><p>"Qi Ran, listen to Father, go back. Your good intentions have already comforted my heart." Zuo Choushan said faintly.</p><p></p><p>Zuo Qi Ran was about to refuse, but a force suddenly lifted her up, she knew it was Zuo Choushan's doing.</p><p></p><p>She didn't say anything more, and turned and stepped into the darkness.</p><p></p><p>Zuo Choushan raised his head, looking at the "Longevity" sign on the plaque above, and sighed, "Three years..."</p><p></p><p>At the same time, Qingxuan Town was bustling with activity, with discussions about the Longevity Tavern everywhere.</p><p></p><p>"Hey, just what kind of person is the owner of the Longevity Tavern, to be able to make the Lord of the Tian She Manor so obedient."</p><p></p><p>"Yes, even now, the Lord of the Tian She Manor is still kneeling outside the Longevity Tavern... I wonder how long he will have to kneel."</p><p></p><p>"We had underestimated the owner of the Longevity Tavern before, to make a Sixth-Grade Immortal Venerable like the Lord of the Tian She Manor bow his head, he must at least be an Eighth-Grade Immortal Venerable."</p><p></p><p>"This has nothing to do with us, we just need to behave ourselves and not cause trouble at the Longevity Tavern. By the way, the Washing Soul Brew is really unparalleled, I was lucky to have some today, it's definitely the best alcohol I've ever had in my life, it's just that the daily limit of 200 jars is really too little, and the number of people on the registration list is too many..."</p><p></p><p>"Don't worry, in the future in this Qingxuan Town, the cultivators who can afford the Washing Soul Brew will not be many, one jar costs three seven-colored spirit stones after all... Whew, who can afford to drink it regularly?"</p><p></p><p>"..."</p><p></p><p>In short,</p><p></p><p>Here is the full English translation of the Chinese excerpt:</p><p></p><p>The Longevity Wine Hall has already made a name for itself thoroughly in Qingxuan Town!</p><p></p><p>Although the trend was inevitable due to the deliciousness of the Xihun Liquor, the Lord of the Heavenly Snake Manor kneeling outside the Longevity Wine Hall also greatly accelerated the progress of the Longevity Wine Hall in Qingxuan Town.</p><p></p><p>Just two days after opening, the Longevity Wine Hall had become known to everyone in this Qingxuan Town that housed nearly 200,000 cultivators.</p><p></p><p>Many stores that previously wanted to unite and target the Longevity Wine Hall suddenly lost their momentum, filled with fear.</p><p></p><p>Since the Lord of the Heavenly Snake Manor had knelt, they no longer dared to act rashly.</p><p></p><p>Naturally, the Longevity Wine Hall had already become the dominant force in Qingxuan Town...</p><p></p><p>Although it was just a wine hall without a bunch of people and without bullying the weak, the principle of "the strong are respected" is eternal.</p><p></p><p>Even in the following two days, the cultivators were increasingly shocked to see the Lord of the Heavenly Snake Manor still kneeling there.</p><p></p><p>On the fourth day, at dawn.</p><p></p><p>Many cultivators casually passed by the courtyard of the Longevity Wine Hall, then their gaze seemed to inadvertently look towards the courtyard gate.</p><p></p><p>They saw the Lord of the Heavenly Snake Manor standing upright at the gate, like a guardian deity, vigilantly scanning the surroundings.</p><p></p><p>Under this rather oppressive gaze, the passing cultivators did not dare to even take a breath.</p><p></p><p>The fifth, sixth, seventh, and eighth days were the same!</p><p></p><p>The crowd finally understood, shocked beyond measure!</p><p></p><p>Goodness, the Lord of the Heavenly Snake Manor was guarding the Longevity Wine Hall...</p><p></p><p>A gatekeeper? </p><p></p><p>For the overlord of a top force in Qingxuan Town to become a watchdog, this enormous change left the crowd unable to react, feeling as if they were dreaming.</p><p></p><p>During this period, Left You and the Elders of the Heavenly Snake Manor also came to visit their Lord, but were eventually chased away by Left Qoushan.</p><p></p><p>Half a month later.</p><p></p><p>Qingxuan Town was still as orderly as before.</p><p></p><p>The business of the Longevity Wine Hall was still booming every day, with the Xihun Liquor increasing from the initial daily limit of 200 jars to 500 jars!</p><p></p><p>The crowd was greatly excited, feeling grateful towards the wine hall, especially for people like Su Qianghe the drunkard, as Luchang Sheng was like their reborn parent.</p><p></p><p>Due to the large daily flow of people in Qingxuan Town, the news of the Longevity Wine Hall with its peerless good liquor gradually spread to some other towns in the Black Sha Domain...</p><p></p><p>Today at noon, the sun was high in the sky, and the black cracks in the azure sky seemed to have become a little brighter.</p><p></p><p>Luchang Sheng, who had been staying in the wine hall for a long time, finally came out of the wine hall.</p><p></p><p>The moment Luchang Sheng stepped out of the courtyard gate, the hundreds of cultivators waiting in line outside were startled, hurriedly bowing, "Proprietor."</p><p></p><p>The motionless Left Qoushan by the door also had a slight change in expression, bowing and saying, "Senior."</p><p></p><p>"You all have come to patronize my wine hall, no need for such formalities," Luchang Sheng said with a light smile, gently waving his sleeve, and a gentle force lifted the crowd.</p><p></p><p>The crowd bowed slightly, feeling something unusual.</p><p></p><p>In this Black Sha Domain, the ordinary cultivators were all arrogant, but who would have thought that this proprietor had such overwhelming strength in Qingxuan Town, yet was still so amiable!</p><p></p><p>It was a rather different experience.</p><p></p><p>"Senior... Who are you?" Left Qoushan asked cautiously.</p><p></p><p>Luchang Sheng looked up at the sky and smiled, "I've been in Qingxuan Town for a while, and haven't had a chance to stroll around. Today the sunshine is just right, the breeze is not oppressive, it's perfect."</p><p></p><p>Left Qoushan hurriedly said, "Senior, shall I lead the way for you?"</p><p></p><p>Before he could finish speaking, he saw a fat man from the queue quickly run up to Luchang Sheng. Left Qoushan immediately frowned and shouted, "Insolent!"</p><p></p><p>"It's fine," Luchang Sheng smiled and stopped him, then turned his head to look at Peng Fang.</p><p></p><p>Peng Fang disdainfully glanced at Left Qoushan, then looked at Luchang Sheng and said with a silly smile, "Proprietor, I know Qingxuan Town very well, I have connections to all the fun places, hehe."</p><p></p><p>The implication was obvious - he wanted to guide Luchang Sheng.</p><p></p><p>Luchang Sheng looked at him meaningfully and smiled, "Alright."</p>

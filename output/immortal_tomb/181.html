        <h1>Chapter 181</h1>
        <div class="content">
            <p>Here is the full English translation of the Chinese excerpt:</p><p></p><p>The Blue Mystery Realm. ‡Æú€©€û€©‡Æú ‚ûÖÔºôÀ¢ÂçÑœÖùêó.ÔΩÉ·óùùïÑ ‡Æú€©€û€©‡Æú</p><p></p><p>Lately, all the cultivators who have been to the Longevity Wine House to drink have discovered a big event.</p><p></p><p>That is, the figure of the blue-robed person who used to lie in the rocking chair in the wine house is gone.</p><p></p><p>There are only two waiters left.</p><p></p><p>Someone puzzled and asked Tong Xin and Lin Dong, "Where did the boss go?"</p><p></p><p>Tong Xin and Lin Dong directly said that Lu Changsheng went out on business, but they don't know the specifics.</p><p></p><p>Although Tong Xin and Lin Dong don't understand, the insiders quickly grasped the meaning!</p><p></p><p>They associated it with the migrating Zhan Imperial Clan...</p><p></p><p>Wow, the boss must have gone to chase after them!</p><p></p><p>What grudge or enmity is it, that they don't even give him a chance to live? Too ruthless!</p><p></p><p>Although everyone guessed that Lu Changsheng went to chase the Zhan Imperial Clan, they had no clues.</p><p></p><p>Because none of them knew where the Zhan Imperial Clan had migrated to, the Heaven's Scar was too vast for them.</p><p></p><p>In the Longevity Wine House,</p><p></p><p>"Cough cough, Little Brother Tong, Little Brother Lin, the boss is not here either... Can you sell us a few more jugs of wine? I'll pay ten times the price!"</p><p></p><p>"Tsk? Ten times? Look at how you're being stingy, Tong Xin, Lin Dong, I'll pay a hundred times!!"</p><p></p><p>"Whew‚Äîa hundred times..."</p><p></p><p>No one dared to continue. Ten times they could still understand, but a hundred times, that's three hundred colorful spirit stones... They don't understand the world of the rich.</p><p></p><p>It's not that they think it's not worth it, the Soul-Washing Brew and Dream-Entering Brew are priceless rare delicacies, but they... even if they sell everything, they can't come up with that much money.</p><p></p><p>Tong Xin's eyes suddenly turned into colorful spirit stones, twinkling, but he soon cleared his throat and said solemnly, "Dear guests, we're sorry, not to mention the inventory is indeed scarce, even if we have the inventory, we don't dare to violate the rules set by the boss..."</p><p></p><p>"Of course, if you dear guests dare to violate the rules set by the boss, the wine cellar is in the backyard... You can go get it yourselves?"</p><p></p><p>Everyone: "......"</p><p></p><p>How dare they... Or rather, who dares to defy the Heaven's Scar?</p><p></p><p>They shuddered when they thought of the boss's gentle smiling face.</p><p></p><p>And not to mention that, even if they got the wine, they couldn't get past the gate where Left Resentment and Right Kindness were.</p><p></p><p>"Cough, Little Brother Tong, we were just joking around haha..."</p><p></p><p>But the laughter sounded a bit awkward.</p><p></p><p>.........</p><p></p><p>In the extreme north of the Heaven's Scar, the rift in the vast sky has faded a bit.</p><p></p><p>Under the sky is an endless green, as far as the eye can see, this is the Extreme Mysterious Forest.</p><p></p><p>It is rumored that if you continue to walk north from here, passing through the Extreme Mysterious Forest, you will be out of the territory of the Heaven's Scar.</p><p></p><p>Although the Extreme Mysterious Forest has a beautiful scenery, all green and pleasing to the eye, it is indeed the number one dangerous place in the Heaven's Scar.</p><p></p><p>Many strong cultivators, even if they guess that passing through the Extreme Mysterious Forest can get them out of the Heaven's Scar, can hardly do it, they either give up halfway or perish in it.</p><p></p><p>However, danger is often accompanied by opportunities.</p><p></p><p>Not to mention the heavenly materials, earthly treasures, and demonic beast cores within, there are also many treasures on the bodies of the countless strong cultivators who have fallen there. If you can find them, you'll hit the jackpot.</p><p></p><p>Naturally, the Extreme Mysterious Forest has become the training ground for many sects in the northern part of the Heaven's Scar.</p><p></p><p>The countless demonic beasts and other unknown dangers there are simply a cultivator's training paradise.</p><p></p><p>Outside the Extreme Mysterious Forest.</p><p></p><p>Towering trees, birds chirping and insects buzzing.</p><p></p><p>There are more than a dozen elders of different attires sitting together in a solemn manner, as if they are all frowning and pondering something.</p><p></p><p>Here is the full English translation of the Chinese excerpt:</p><p></p><p>An old man suddenly changed expression.</p><p></p><p>Seeing this, the crowd looked at him puzzledly, and someone hurriedly asked, "Elder Jin, what's wrong?"</p><p></p><p>Jin Hua paused for a moment, took a light breath, and said, "Elders of the various sects, the Sect Master of my Tianlong Sect has sent a message... that those who entered the Extreme Gloomy Forest a few days ago... may be the imperial clan of the Holy Immortal Realm, the Zhan Clan."</p><p></p><p>The Zhan Clan!</p><p></p><p>The crowd looked at each other, their expressions shocked!</p><p></p><p>What was the Zhan Clan's imperial clan doing so far away in this Extreme Gloomy Forest?</p><p></p><p>At this moment, all the elders present had their expressions frozen, as they had also successively received transmissions from their own sects!</p><p></p><p>After a moment...</p><p></p><p>"Sss‚Äî"</p><p></p><p>The elders all sucked in a cold breath, their eyes filled with terror and despair.</p><p></p><p>Unexpectedly, during the time they and their disciples were cultivating in the Extreme Gloomy Forest, such a major event had occurred in the outside world, which could be described as a complete upheaval!</p><p></p><p>The Jiang Clan's imperial clan had been wiped out entirely,</p><p></p><p>The Zhan Clan had fled in the night,</p><p></p><p>The Chen Clan's ancestor had personally led the upper echelons to visit the innkeeper of the Longevity Wine Inn, and this innkeeper of the Longevity Wine Inn was the ruthless person who had destroyed the Jiang Clan!</p><p></p><p>Lu Changsheng, currently recognized as the number one of the Heaven's Scar.</p><p></p><p>The message even said that Lu Changsheng had not been in the Longevity Wine Inn in Qingxuan Town of the Black Sha Domain for some time,</p><p></p><p>Then... where had he gone?</p><p></p><p>No need to ask, anyone with a brain could guess that he had definitely come to hunt down the Zhan Clan!</p><p></p><p>And the Zhan Clan had entered the Extreme Gloomy Forest, is it possible that... that Lu Changsheng might also have...</p><p></p><p>It's simply terrifying to think about.</p><p></p><p>The elders' nerves were instantly taut, and they nervously scanned their surroundings, not even sparing the branches of the trees.</p><p></p><p>They were truly afraid that the ruthless person might be silently watching them nearby...</p><p></p><p>"What, what should we do? If there are no accidents, there is still a full month before the cultivation exercise is over, and the Extreme Gloomy Forest was already very dangerous to begin with, and now with the Zhan Clan and that ruthless person inside... this elder is really getting jittery, how can our disciples withstand it?" An elder immediately turned pale, frowning and looking worried.</p><p></p><p>Their sects were not actually weak, but compared to the imperial clans, they were far, far behind.</p><p></p><p>And that Lu Changsheng, he had even said he would slaughter the Jiang Clan, </p><p></p><p>If any disciples were to accidentally provoke him, their sects would be like harvesting scallions.</p><p></p><p>Hearing this, the other elders also frowned, their carefree mood from leading the team earlier had now become extremely tense.</p><p></p><p>"Now we can only wait quietly," Jin Hua sighed. "But you elders don't need to worry too much, whether it's the Zhan Clan or that senior Lu, they must be heading deeper into the Extreme Gloomy Forest, and our sect disciples are only in the outer and middle regions, and the Extreme Gloomy Forest is so vast, it's unlikely we'll encounter them."</p><p></p><p>"I hope so," the elders said, slightly relieved after hearing this.</p><p></p><p>Elder Jin was indeed the leader of this Tianlong Sect expedition, and he was much calmer than them in the face of the situation, and what he said also made a lot of sense.</p><p></p><p>The Extreme Gloomy Forest was so vast, how could they possibly run into them just like that, it would be extremely unlucky.</p><p></p><p>They just hope that those little brats, if they really do encounter the Zhan Clan's people or that senior Lu, they'd better keep their eyes open!</p><p></p><p>Whichever side it is, they are not sects that can be provoked.</p><p></p><p>As long as they keep their eyes open and don't provoke them, those big shots won't even pay much attention to those juniors.</p><p></p><p>Jin Hua settled his heart and smiled, "Elders, don't think too much about it. I hope our Tianlong Sect, Sanqing Hall, and Lieyang Valley disciples can all get through this safely."</p>

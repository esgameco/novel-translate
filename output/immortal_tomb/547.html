        <h1>Chapter 547</h1>
        <div class="content">
            <p>Here is the full English translation of the Chinese excerpt:</p><p></p><p>The old fox!</p><p></p><p>Although Yin Quan was cursing inwardly, he still sat down with a smile on his face.</p><p></p><p>After Mei Cangwu personally poured a cup of tea for Yin Quan, he tentatively asked:</p><p></p><p>"Does the Sect Master have a plan?"</p><p></p><p>The plan was naturally referring to the plan to eliminate the Tianwu Sect!</p><p></p><p>As the number one martial arts sect in the Star Luo Empire, to eliminate the Tianwu Sect was no small matter, it was not just talk!</p><p></p><p>"Mm."</p><p></p><p>Yin Quan nodded, took a sip of tea, then slammed the teacup down on the table, his eyes sharp and fierce, and said:</p><p></p><p>"At that time, Dean Mei will lure out that bastard Bai Jiang from the Tianwu Sect, and then I, the Sect Master, will lead the disciples of our Dao Yan Sect to launch a surprise attack on the Tianwu Sect! Dean Mei only needs to hold Bai Jiang back, and I, the Sect Master, will definitely wipe out the Tianwu Sect at the fastest speed, and then rush over to help you!"</p><p></p><p>The Bai Jiang that Yin Quan mentioned was naturally the Sect Master of the Tianwu Sect!</p><p></p><p>"A tactic of luring the tiger away from the mountain?"</p><p></p><p>Mei Cangwu nodded, this method was indeed feasible!</p><p></p><p>Now the Tianwu Sect was in the open, while their Beidou Academy and Dao Yan Sect were in the dark...</p><p></p><p>Yin Quan continued: "As long as the Tianwu Sect is eliminated, the other martial arts sects in the Star Luo Empire will not be a concern. Daring to join hands to kill my Five Elders, I, the Sect Master, will definitely settle the score with them!"</p><p></p><p>Mei Cangwu nodded again, but soon his brow furrowed as he said:</p><p></p><p>"Sect Master, this method is feasible, but how should the most critical link be implemented? I have been dealing with Bai Jiang for many years, and he is so cautious, as I know better than anyone."</p><p></p><p>Hearing this, Yin Quan also frowned and fell into deep thought.</p><p></p><p>Indeed, the whole process sounded seamless, but the most important link, which was to lure out Bai Jiang, was not easy to implement!</p><p></p><p>Yin Quan also knew very well that this bastard Bai Jiang was extremely cautious.</p><p></p><p>After a long silence,</p><p></p><p>Yin Quan suddenly looked up at Mei Cangwu, his gaze making Mei Cangwu's eyelids twitch, making Mei Cangwu feel that Yin Quan had come up with a sinister plan targeting him.</p><p></p><p>This cunning Yin Quan!</p><p></p><p>Unable to hold back, he asked,</p><p></p><p>"Sect Master, why have you been staring at me?"</p><p></p><p>Yin Quan's face broke into a brilliant smile. "Dean Mei, I actually have a way to lure out that bastard Bai Jiang."</p><p></p><p>Without waiting for Mei Cangwu to ask, Yin Quan continued:</p><p></p><p>"At that time, Dean Mei can be a bit humble and say to Bai Jiang that you want to apologize to him in person and invite him to drink. Given my understanding of Bai Jiang, even if he is so cautious, he will not be able to resist the pleasure of being mocked and humiliated in person and seeing you humbly apologize. It will be a bit of a humiliation for Dean Mei."</p><p></p><p>As soon as Yin Quan finished speaking,</p><p></p><p>Mei Cangwu suddenly stood up with a slap, "Impossible! How could I, Mei Cangwu, possibly go and apologize to Bai Jiang!! Don't bring this up again!"</p><p></p><p>"And Yin Quan, you are too presumptuous. Bai Jiang and I have been competing for many years, and how could he not see through the trick! I, Mei Cangwu, am who I am, and Bai Jiang also knows me very well!"</p><p></p><p>Yin Quan shook his head and smiled, waving his hand, "Dean Mei, please calm down. Bai Jiang knows you, and how could I, the Sect Master, not know that? Don't worry, Dean Mei, I just know that Bai Jiang won't be able to resist such a temptation of pleasure!"</p><p></p><p>"And although Bai Jiang is cautious, he has become more arrogant since becoming the number one person in the Star Luo Empire, and he won't think that you, Dean Mei, can pose a threat to his life! Weighing the pros and cons, he will not be able to resist coming out!"</p><p></p><p>Hearing this, Mei Cangwu's face still didn't look good. "Sect Master, I don't want to bow my head to Bai Jiang."</p><p></p><p>Yin Quan frowned and said sternly:</p><p></p><p>"Ah, it's just an act, don't take it seriously. As long as the means justify the end, that's the truth. A real man can bend and straighten, Dean Mei. No wonder I say my words are harsh, are you scholars all so hypocritically high-minded?"</p><p></p><p>Mei Cangwu's face darkened. "You...!"</p><p></p><p>"What about me?" </p><p></p><p>Yin Quan suddenly stood up and shouted loudly, "Dean Mei, why don't you think about how much oppression your Beidou Academy has suffered from the Tianwu Sect all these years, and how many students have died at the hands of the Tianwu Sect!!"</p><p></p><p>"For those dead students, what's wrong with pretending to be a coward? Is your face more important, or is it for the sake of those who have died?"</p><p></p><p>Here is the full English translation of the Chinese excerpt:</p><p></p><p>"Is student vengeance important? The best opportunity is now right in front of Dean Mei, but Dean Mei is still hesitating, unwilling to let go of his pride, and needs me, a martial arts sect master, to point it out? Wasn't the Sect Master right when he said that false high-mindedness? "</p><p></p><p>Beside him, the middle-aged man saw that Yin Quan was speaking so disrespectfully, and he wanted to stop him, but what he said was right on the mark. In the end, he could only sigh and remain silent.</p><p></p><p>Mei Cangwu looked at Yin Quan for a while, his lips moving, and finally sat down dejectedly, raising his cup and sighing:</p><p></p><p>"Yin Sect Master, you scolded well."</p><p></p><p>Yin Quan coughed dryly, also realizing that he had spoken too harshly, and said to Mei Cangwu, "Dean Mei, I was a bit hot-headed just now, and please don't take my words to heart. I certainly didn't mean to belittle you!"</p><p></p><p>Seeing Mei Cangwu drinking his tea with a gloomy expression and not speaking, Yin Quan said, "Dean Mei, then let's think of another way."</p><p></p><p>"No, let's go with what Yin Sect Master said."</p><p></p><p>Mei Cangwu suddenly looked up and said solemnly.</p><p></p><p>Huh?</p><p></p><p>The middle-aged man beside him was startled, and then his eyes showed a sense of emotion and relief. He knew the Dean too well, and knew how much the Dean cared about his face.</p><p></p><p>Yin Quan was stunned for a moment, then exclaimed excitedly, "Dean Mei agrees?"</p><p></p><p>Of course it's good if he agrees! After all, apart from this plan, Yin Quan really couldn't think of any other way to lure out that bastard Bai Jiang in the short term.</p><p></p><p>"Hehe, as Yin Sect Master said, over the years, how many students of the North Star Academy have died at the hands of the Tianwu Sect? As the Dean, my previous behavior was really unbecoming, and I'm truly sorry for the students who have passed away!"</p><p></p><p>Mei Cangwu said with some excitement, then bitterly smiled, "I'm not even as good as Yin Sect Master, a martial arts practitioner, in caring for the students."</p><p></p><p>"Dean Mei, you are being too hard on yourself! Dean Mei was just blinded by the situation," Yin Quan quickly comforted.</p><p></p><p>Ahem, to be honest, he wasn't really caring for the students of the North Star Academy, but was just pursuing his own goals.</p><p></p><p>"So Dean Mei has decided?"</p><p></p><p>Yin Quan asked again.</p><p></p><p>This matter was no joke. If things went wrong when they started to act, and Mei Cangwu backed out, it would be a disaster.</p><p></p><p>"Yes, I've decided." Mei Cangwu nodded and asked, "Yin Sect Master, when shall we start the action?"</p><p></p><p>"In two days, I need to go back to the sect to make some preparations. Dean Mei should also remember to bring the strong ones from the North Star Academy. After you go down, Dean Mei can start preparing, after all, the journey also takes some time," Yin Quan stood up and said.</p><p></p><p>Mei Cangwu nodded, and his gaze at Yin Quan had changed a bit.</p><p></p><p>This Yin Quan really thought things through...</p><p></p><p>The North Star Academy is located in the imperial capital, so they can't dispatch too many people, otherwise it will arouse suspicion.</p><p></p><p>"Okay, then I'll take my leave first. We'll contact each other with the jade token."</p><p></p><p>Yin Quan handed over a communication jade token and turned to leave.</p><p></p><p>Mei Cangwu rubbed the jade token in his hand, suddenly calling out, "Yin Sect Master."</p><p></p><p>Hmm?</p><p></p><p>Yin Quan's figure paused, and he turned his head, puzzled.</p><p></p><p>"Yin Sect Master, you are a martial cultivator, while I am a scholarly cultivator. Moreover, in this Star Luo Empire, there are many martial sects, but the North Star Academy is the only scholarly institution."</p><p></p><p>Mei Cangwu pondered for a moment, then looked up and said, "The Daozhan Sect, as a martial sect, is cooperating with my North Star Academy to destroy your martial sects. When the time comes, Yin Sect Master, won't you be afraid of the ridicule of the other martial sects and the many discussions behind your back from the common people?"</p><p></p><p>Yin Quan paused, and said in a deep voice, "If they are unjust, then I shall not be blamed for being unrighteous!"</p><p></p><p>Yin Quan's gaze was like a sharp blade, and he swept out, with only a mocking remark echoing behind him,</p><p></p><p>"Furthermore, the victor is the king, the loser the outcast. When that time comes, who dares to ridicule, who dares to discuss? I'll just cut out their tongues!"</p><p></p><p>Hearing this, Mei Cangwu and the middle-aged man's pupils both shrank slightly.</p><p></p><p>This Yin Quan is truly a ruthless warlord.</p>

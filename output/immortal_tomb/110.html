        <h1>Chapter 110</h1>
        <div class="content">
            <p>Here is the full English translation of the Chinese excerpt:</p><p></p><p>"Hm? What's going on?</p><p></p><p>The five golden-badge inspectors looked at the entrance of the Heavenly Prison with puzzled and suspicious eyes. There were many azure ice traces spreading out, glittering in the sunlight.</p><p></p><p>"Why are you all standing there! Hurry up and enter the Heavenly Prison!" </p><p></p><p>The golden-badge inspector said sternly to the crowd.</p><p></p><p>"M-My lord, the brothers who went in have all turned into ice statues..." one of the inspectors responded with difficulty.</p><p></p><p>Hm?</p><p></p><p>The five golden-badge inspectors exchanged glances, their expressions slightly changing soon after. It seemed someone was about to come out of the Heavenly Prison entrance, and their hearts grew heavy. No matter what, they couldn't let the jailbreak perpetrator and that Luo Ge escape today.</p><p></p><p>Otherwise, they would face the towering wrath of the Grand Patriarch Jinyang.</p><p></p><p>At this moment, countless eyes were fixed intently on the Heavenly Prison entrance, not daring to look away even for a moment.</p><p></p><p>The light footsteps grew clearer and closer.</p><p></p><p>Soon, a young man in blue robes, hands clasped behind his back, appeared at the Heavenly Prison entrance.</p><p></p><p>Behind Lü Changsheng was the ailing Luo Ge.</p><p></p><p>The Heavenly Prison immediately became restless! Immortal spiritual energies surged, poised to strike!</p><p></p><p>As soon as the golden-badge inspectors gave the order, they would unleash the most violent attacks in an instant!</p><p></p><p>But the five golden-badge inspectors, upon seeing Lü Changsheng, had a change of expression.</p><p></p><p>This person... seems to resemble someone in their memory.</p><p></p><p>"Don't you feel that this person looks a bit like... the one who disappeared from the Central Immortal Realm a million years ago?" </p><p></p><p>One of the golden-badge inspectors said with a slightly trembling voice.</p><p></p><p>The other golden-badge inspectors also grew nervous, their fingers fidgeting.</p><p></p><p>"It's... impossible. Not only has that person been missing for a million years, but how could he suddenly appear in our Inspection Palace? Even the Yin-Yang Immortal Emperor of the Southern Immortal Realm rarely comes here, let alone that person... And since this man is here to rescue Luo Ge, it's even more clear that he's not that person."</p><p></p><p>"That's right. Besides, the four immortal realms are so vast, it's not unusual for people to have similar appearances."</p><p></p><p>"Mm-hmm..."</p><p></p><p>"..."</p><p></p><p>The five inspectors exchanged words, each trying to subconsciously eliminate that possibility.</p><p></p><p>But somehow, they felt an inexplicable growing sense of unease.</p><p></p><p>A single person, even if he just resembles the one in their memory, could exert immense pressure on them!</p><p></p><p>The other inspectors kept glancing at the five golden-badge inspectors, not understanding why they hadn't given the order to slay the jailbreak perpetrator.</p><p></p><p>The space fell into an eerie silence...</p><p></p><p>Luo Ge behind Lü Changsheng also felt somewhat puzzled, but soon realized that these inspectors were probably waiting for Jinyang's arrival. It seems this senior in blue robes had them somewhat at a loss.</p><p></p><p>"Summon your patriarch, I wish to have a word with him," Lü Changsheng said impatiently to the insignificant insects.</p><p></p><p>As soon as the words left his mouth, the crowd stood dumbfounded.</p><p></p><p>But soon, an overwhelming imperial aura suddenly descended, suppressing the entire space!</p><p></p><p>Boom!!</p><p></p><p>Thousands of inspectors, including the five golden-badge ones, instantly changed color, their knees buckling as they knelt down in a grand manner.</p><p></p><p>All their faces were filled with fear!</p><p></p><p>Especially the golden-badge inspectors, who felt their world spinning. Never in their lives had they experienced such panic and great terror!</p><p></p><p>The young man in blue robes before them was none other than - the Immortal Emperor Changsheng himself!!</p><p></p><p>Luo Ge knelt behind Lü Changsheng, his whole body trembling.</p><p></p><p>He finally understood why the senior in blue felt familiar - he was the big shot from the Central Immortal Realm.</p><p></p><p>"This palace would like to see which fool dares to defy the... imperial might!" </p><p></p><p>Just then, Jinyang arrived outside the Heavenly Prison. Before he could finish his words, he was pressed to the ground by the imperial aura!</p><p></p><p>This scene left the bewildered inspectors aghast. Their patriarch was a peak Immortal King realm expert, how could he have knelt down like that?</p><p></p><p>Jinyang stiffly raised his head, looking towards the Heavenly Prison entrance, and his pupils shrank to pinpoints upon recognizing Immortal Emperor Changsheng.</p><p></p><p>Lü Changsheng materialized before Jinyang, looking down at him.</p><p></p><p>"I did not know the Immortal Emperor had graced us with his presence. Please forgive my lack of proper welcome!" Jinyang trembled as he bowed his head.</p><p></p><p>He was racking his brain, unable to understand why the long-missing Immortal Emperor Changsheng would come to his Inspection Palace, and how Luo Ge could be connected to the Immortal Emperor.</p><p></p><p>Immortal Emperor!!</p><p></p><p>The inspectors' minds went blank, finally realizing the truth.</p><p></p><p>But which Immortal Emperor was this... Could it be their Southern Immortal Realm's Yin-Yang Immortal Emperor?</p><p></p><p>Lü Changsheng looked at him and stated calmly, "For obstructing the ascension channels in the borderlands for tens of thousands of years, you deserve punishment. This need not be elaborated further."</p><p></p><p>Jinyang's heart suddenly jolted!</p><p></p><p>His expression turned to one of terror!</p><p></p><p>He never imagined that such a trivial matter would catch the attention of Immortal Emperor Changsheng!</p><p></p><p>In his previous thoughts, even if Immortal Emperor Changsheng had been missing for a million years, the obstructed ascension channel was just in the borderlands of the Southern Immortal Realm. How could it possibly be noticed by the Immortal Emperor all the way in the Central Immortal Realm?</p><p></p><p>"Immortal Emperor, I beg your forgiveness! Jinyang, Jinyang...!" </p><p></p><p>Jinyang kowtowed, his tone extremely panicked, but he didn't know how to explain himself.</p><p></p><p>Outside the Heavenly Prison, it was silent.</p><p></p><p>The crowd listened to their patriarch's humble pleading, their hearts tingling.</p><p></p><p>Their patriarch was a figure of importance in the entire Southern Immortal Realm, standing at the peak in the Soaring Yang Immortal Continent.</p><p></p><p>Yet, faced with an Immortal Emperor, he was as lowly as dust.</p><p></p><p>"According to the First Immortal Edict, this Inspection Palace... should no longer exist," Lü Changsheng said.</p><p></p><p>Jinyang was terrified to the core of his soul, kowtowing desperately and wailing,</p><p></p><p>"Immortal Emperor! Jinyang harbored delusions and violated the edicts you yourself had formulated. I deserve death a thousand times over, but the Inspection Headquarters of the Soaring Yang Immortal Continent is a direct force under the Immortal Emperor's Palace of the Southern Immortal Realm. Please, Immortal Emperor, have mercy for the sake of the Yin-Yang Immortal Emperor!"</p><p></p><p>The inspectors were stunned, their gazes filled with shock. This was the long-missing Immortal Emperor Changsheng, the one shrouded in the greatest mystery in the four immortal realms.</p><p></p><p>He had returned.</p><p></p><p>Lü Changsheng smiled. "Do you think even the venerable Yin-Yang would dare to ask for my favor?"</p><p></p><p>Jinyang's heart trembled violently. Yin-Yang, the full name of the Yin-Yang Immortal Emperor - in the four immortal realms, only the one before him would dare to address him so directly.</p><p></p><p>"Immortal Emperor... I-I-I-I...!" Jinyang was completely at a loss.</p><p></p><p>He had never imagined this would happen, nor that he would incur the wrath of Immortal Emperor Changsheng.</p><p></p><p>"If you have anyone to blame, blame your own patriarch," Lü Changsheng said, sweeping his gaze over the dazed inspectors.</p><p></p><p>Some inspectors were utterly dejected. They had just joined today and were still happily excited back then.</p><p></p><p>"Immortal Emperor!"</p><p></p><p>Here is the full English translation of the excerpt from the Chinese novel:</p><p></p><p>Fo realized something, and the golden pupils of Jingyang suddenly shrank as he let out a low roar, begging for mercy!</p><p></p><p>Lu Changsheng's face was expressionless as he casually waved his sleeve.</p><p></p><p>A trail of ice emerged from beneath Lu Changsheng's feet, then rapidly spread out in a terrifying spider-web-like pattern in all directions!</p><p></p><p>The first to be frozen was Jingyang, who was instantly transformed into an ice sculpture, the expression of fear frozen on his face.</p><p></p><p>Crack, crack, crack, crack, crack!</p><p></p><p>Soon after, numerous Inspectorate officials were also encased in ice. </p><p></p><p>In no time at all, the vast Inspectorate Hall had become a crystal palace, still floating in the air as usual.</p><p></p><p>But the difference was that it now emanated an icy chill and deathly silence. </p><p></p><p>The Inspectorate Hall had instantly been plunged into an ice age.</p><p></p><p>Lu Changsheng glanced at the dazed Li Ge, then stepped out and disappeared.</p><p></p><p>Li Ge numbly surveyed his surroundings, his teeth chattering uncontrollably. </p><p></p><p>"Truly a Immortal Emperor, so overwhelmingly powerful."</p><p></p><p>The grand Inspectorate Hall of the Fushun Immortal Continent... had just been destroyed.</p><p></p><p>He looked at the frozen Jingyang, a mighty Immortal King in his own right, now devoid of any sign of life, as well as the many Inspectorate officials, all lifeless.</p><p></p><p>Li Ge finally understood - the Immortal Emperor Changsheng had not come specifically to rescue him, but to settle accounts with the Inspectorate Hall, and had simply saved him in the process.</p><p></p><p>Li Ge struck the ice beneath him, finding it incredibly hard, unlike ordinary ice.</p><p></p><p>Finally, he took a deep breath and hurriedly left this hell on earth.</p><p></p><p>Li Ge knew that after today, the Southern Immortal Realm would be shaken, and many powerful figures would come to investigate the frozen Inspectorate Hall.</p><p></p><p>He knew what he had to do next - forget everything that had happened today.</p><p></p><p>...</p><p></p><p>"Ah, look!!"</p><p></p><p>"Sss! What's going on?!"</p><p></p><p>"Heavens!!"</p><p></p><p>"The Inspectorate Hall, how did it..."</p><p></p><p>"Uh..."</p><p></p><p>In the cities below, countless gazes of bewilderment were cast towards the towering, floating palace.</p><p></p><p>It was an ice-encased palace, glittering in the sunlight, yet exuding a deathly stillness.</p><p></p><p>The once-glorious Inspectorate Hall, how had it become this...?</p><p></p><p>The next moment, numerous cultivators rushed towards the frozen palace in the sky, sensing that some earth-shattering event had occurred.</p><p></p><p>Soon, the cultivators arrived at the Inspectorate Hall.</p><p></p><p>"Sss-!"</p><p></p><p>Gasps of shock echoed.</p><p></p><p>They trembled as they beheld the scene before them, their eyes bulging.</p><p></p><p>Mustering their courage, they cautiously approached the Inspectorate Hall.</p><p></p><p>Everything in sight was mercilessly encased in ice - the walls, the vegetation, the ground, the pillars, the flowing water... and thousands of Inspectorate officials, from the bronze to the silver to even five golden-ranked ones.</p><p></p><p>"That's Immortal King Jingyang!!"</p><p></p><p>Someone's exclamation drew the attention of the cultivators, who hurried over and saw the ice sculpture of the Inspectorate Hall's master, Jingyang, his life force extinguished, with only the expression of terror frozen on his face.</p><p></p><p>The cultivators shuddered, unable to utter a word.</p><p></p><p>They surveyed the deathly stillness around them, taking in the bizarre and tragic state of the Inspectorate Hall.</p><p></p><p>The Inspectorate Hall was a direct subordinate of the Immortal Emperor's Palace. And now, an Immortal King had perished.</p><p></p><p>This matter would undoubtedly shake the Immortal Emperor's Palace!</p><p></p><p>The Southern Immortal Realm was about to be turbulent.</p><p></p><p>...</p><p></p><p>At the same time, in a remote area southeast of the Fushun Immortal Continent, the old turtle stood with a hunched back.</p><p></p><p>He stared at the Inspectorate sub-hall before him, a malicious smile spreading across his face.</p><p></p><p>"Come out and face your Grandpa Turtle!"</p><p></p><p>Immediately, the Inspectorate sub-hall stirred, and hundreds of bronze-ranked Inspectorate officials appeared in the sky, glaring at the old turtle.</p><p></p><p>"What insolent rogue dares to cause a ruckus in the Inspectorate Hall?"</p><p></p><p>The old turtle chuckled, "Where is your master?"</p><p></p><p>"We do not know what you are talking about, sir."</p><p></p><p>At this moment, an elder appeared, gazing solemnly at the old turtle, sensing the extraordinary power before him, and that the visitor likely harbored ill intentions.</p><p></p><p>"Nothing much, I just came to destroy you all because you've offended my master. As a courtesy, I'm here to say hello."</p><p></p><p>The old turtle waved his hand amiably.</p><p></p><p>Destroy us and just say hello? </p><p></p><p>The faces of the Inspectorate officials turned as if they had eaten excrement - so arrogant, so outrageous!</p><p></p><p>"A while ago, in the Langtian Domain, you killed a silver-ranked one, that was one of yours, right?" the old turtle said casually.</p><p></p><p>The sub-hall master's expression changed, his eyes instantly turning bloodshot as he roared, "That was my son you killed?!"</p><p></p><p>The old turtle was slightly surprised, but nodded solemnly, "Ah, so that silver-ranked one was your son."</p><p></p><p>"What about my granddaughter then?" the sub-hall master demanded, his face flushed with rage.</p><p></p><p>"Your granddaughter..." the old turtle thought for a moment, then said, "I think my master killed her. Your granddaughter is so honored to have been killed by my master."</p><p></p><p>"Insolent!" the sub-hall master raged, his heart burning with fury.</p><p></p><p>"Insolent?" the old turtle sneered, then his expression darkened as he shouted, "You Inspectorate Hall have been obstructing the ascension channels, violating the Immortal Codes, and wrongly accusing people - you all deserve to die a thousand deaths!"</p><p></p><p>The sub-hall master hesitated, then in a deep voice said, "What the Immortal Codes have to do with you? I advise you not to meddle in this, the waters run deep..."</p><p></p><p>"Let me make you insignificant insects understand." The old turtle sneered, "My master is the Immortal Emperor of the Central Immortal Realm, that's right, he has returned."</p><p></p><p>The sub-hall master's pupils shrank in shock, "You're lying!"</p><p></p><p>The Inspectorate officials also felt a chill down their backs, unsure of what to make of this.</p><p></p><p>"Hehe, little insects, go die!" The old turtle rubbed his palms together.</p><p></p><p>Realizing he could not afford to underestimate this visitor, the sub-hall master immediately mobilized his Immortal energy, his robes billowing without wind.</p><p></p><p>The oppressive aura of a Chaos Immortal Lord descended upon the scene, draining the colors from the sky and earth.</p><p></p><p>The sub-hall master formed seals, and the Taiji Bagua in his sea of consciousness spun rapidly, causing his hand to erupt in a brilliant azure Immortal energy.</p><p></p><p>In the next moment, a hundred-zhang long azure lightning whip appeared in his hand, and he viciously lashed it towards the old turtle.</p><p></p><p>In just an instant, he had unleashed five strikes!</p><p></p><p>Crack, crack, crack, crack, crack!</p><p></p><p>"Chaos Lightning Whip Technique - Five Scar Whip!"</p><p></p><p>The Inspectorate officials were awestruck, "It's the sub-hall master's Chaos Lightning Five Scar Whip! Rumor has it he once used this to severely injure a fellow Chaos Immortal Lord!"</p><p></p><p>The old turtle laughed, "Five whips? What a pathetic whip technique!"</p><p></p><p>With that, he spread his five fingers and casually slapped at the dazzling whips approaching him.</p><p></p><p>Boom!!</p><p></p><p>The palm strike dispersed the five whips in an instant.</p><p></p><p>The sub-hall master coughed up a mouthful of blood, his expression one of utter disbelief.</p><p></p><p>"Hehe, die!" </p><p></p><p>The old turtle flipped his palm downwards, and the palm strike descended like the Five Finger Mountain, crushing the sub-hall master and his subordinates into powder.</p><p></p><p>Rumble!!!</p><p></p><p>When the commotion subsided, the sub-hall was no more.</p><p></p><p>The old turtle dusted off his hands, his face full of mockery as he vanished into the void.</p><p></p><p>"What can you insignificant insects do against the Immortal Path? Tch!"</p>

        <h1>Chapter 192</h1>
        <div class="content">
            <p>Here is the full English translation of the Chinese excerpt:</p><p></p><p>"Little Black, A-Bin, you two wait up! Could it be that the disciple token on your waists is...?"</p><p></p><p>At this moment, a cultivator who recognized Cai Xu and Huang Bin shouted.</p><p></p><p>The scene suddenly quieted down, and the cultivators all looked at them with flickering gazes.</p><p></p><p>Cai Xu and Huang Bin raised their eyebrows, unable to resist the corners of their mouths twitching.</p><p></p><p>It seems... their disciple tokens on their waists have been discovered after all... Damn it, they had hidden it so well, it's really hard to stay low-key.</p><p></p><p>Cai Xu and Huang Bin glanced at each other from the corners of their eyes, then suddenly turned around!</p><p></p><p>Cai Xu: "Since you've asked so sincerely!"</p><p></p><p>Huang Bin: "We'll graciously tell you!"</p><p></p><p>Cai Xu: "We originally wanted to be low-key!"</p><p></p><p>Huang Bin: "But you wouldn't allow it!"</p><p></p><p>Cai Xu: "We are the promising Xiao Yao Sect's menial disciples!"</p><p></p><p>Huang Bin: "And we're the first batch, hehe!"</p><p></p><p>The crowd: "......"</p><p></p><p>After a moment of silence, bursts of laughter erupted like thunder in the area!</p><p></p><p>"Haha! To be just a lowly menial, look how proud you are!! I can't take it, haha, my stomach hurts so much! Someone come save me......"</p><p></p><p>"Hahaha......"</p><p></p><p>"......"</p><p></p><p>Seeing the cultivators laughing uproariously, Cai Xu and Huang Bin's expressions changed slightly!</p><p></p><p>Huang Bin was indignant, wanting to refute, but was pulled back by Cai Xu!</p><p></p><p>Cai Xu hooked the corner of his mouth and said loudly, "A-Bin, we are now the esteemed disciples of the Xiao Yao Sect. We should have dignity, no need to stoop to their level. Let them laugh if they want! Tomorrow, let's see who's still laughing!"</p><p></p><p>Saying that, he pulled the silent Huang Bin and left.</p><p></p><p>Leaving behind the still-laughing crowd.</p><p></p><p>"Tch! To be just a lowly menial, look how proud they are! Tomorrow, we'll go to the Xiao Yao Sect and see just how remarkable this unheard-of sect really is!"</p><p></p><p>"......"</p><p></p><p>Cai Xu and Huang Bin walked quickly, hearing the mocking behind them. They sneered inwardly, waiting for tomorrow when these people would no longer be laughing. They would surely be envious of the two of them, just thinking about it made them feel elated.</p><p></p><p>Immersed in their thoughts, the two walked hurriedly, almost colliding with a person coming towards them in the bustling street.</p><p></p><p>"Excuse us, fellow Daoist, we weren't paying attention," Cai Xu apologized quickly.</p><p></p><p>Huang Bin also scratched his head, looking embarrassed.</p><p></p><p>They looked at the blue-robed man in front of them, and a sense of unease began to rise in their hearts, feeling that this person was not simple, exuding an indescribable pressure.</p><p></p><p>Lu Changsheng looked at the two calmly.</p><p></p><p>Cai Xu and Huang Bin trembled inexplicably, realizing they were blocking the way, so they quickly moved aside.</p><p></p><p>Lu Changsheng stepped forward, passing between the two, and soon disappeared into the crowd.</p><p></p><p>"A-Bin, I don't know why, but that blue-robed man just now gave me such a strong sense of pressure... My heart almost jumped out of my throat."</p><p></p><p>Cai Xu turned and looked at the crowd, still shaken.</p><p></p><p>Huang Bin nodded, that feeling of being suppressed by a superior was truly inexplicable, even though they didn't know this person.</p><p></p><p>"Little Black, let's go home quickly. Tomorrow we have to return to the sect, and the sect is also holding a disciple recruitment day, so there will be some excitement to see."</p><p></p><p>.........</p><p></p><p>In less than a day, under the promotion of the various servants and disciples, the unknown Xiao Yao Sect had become a hot topic in the various cities south of the Canglang Zhou region.</p><p></p><p>Many cultivators, with the mentality of not wanting to miss out, decided to go to the Xiao Yao Sect the next day to take a look.</p><p></p><p>And the Xiao Yao Sect, naturally, had come into the sight of the three major nine-rank sects.</p><p></p><p>Night. </p><p></p><p>Blood Flame Inn.</p><p></p><p>In the议事殿 (Assembly Hall), the elders frowned and discussed:</p><p></p><p>"Xiao Yao Sect? When did this sect appear in the southern part of our Canglang Zhou?"</p><p></p><p>Here is the full English translation of the Chinese excerpt:</p><p></p><p>"The Carefree Sect? What is that?" </p><p></p><p>"I don't know, this Carefree Sect just appeared out of nowhere. Today, it suddenly started spreading rumors in all the major cities, saying that the treatment of their disciples is even better than our Blood Flame Pavilion. Even the Cosmic Veil Gate and the Rainbow Pavilion are said to be inferior to them."</p><p></p><p>"Hmph, how is that possible? But this Carefree Sect sure has a lot of guts, daring to recruit disciples at the same time as our three major sects!"</p><p></p><p>"That's right, all this time, whenever our three major sects recruit disciples, the other small sects and factions don't even dare to compete for the resources."</p><p></p><p>At this time, Fan Hong, the seated elder, narrowed his eyes and said indifferently, "We don't need to bother with that Carefree Sect for now, they are just a bunch of clowns. Even if they shout to the heavens, it's useless, the best talents will ultimately make their choice among the three major sects. For now, just focus on recruiting disciples properly... Once that's done, we can properly teach that Carefree Sect a lesson."</p><p></p><p>Seeing Fan Hong speak, the other elders immediately quieted down and bowed, saying, "Yes, Pavilion Master."</p><p></p><p>At the same time, the Cosmic Veil Gate was just like the Blood Flame Pavilion, with the Sect Master and the elders briefly discussing this so-called Carefree Sect before dispersing.</p><p></p><p>With disciple recruitment imminent, they had no time to waste on this nameless small sect. As for this nameless sect's provocation, their thoughts were the same as the Blood Flame Pavilion's - they would deal with it properly afterwards.</p><p></p><p>In fact, it was not just these two major sects, many small sects and factions in the southern part of the Canglan Continent were also shocked and gleeful upon hearing the news.</p><p></p><p>A small sect that no one had ever heard of, choosing to recruit disciples on the same day as the three major sects, this was nothing short of a provocation, right?</p><p></p><p>But...</p><p></p><p>Some small sects actually thought that the Carefree Sect was not simple.</p><p></p><p>After all, in this world, who would want a short life?</p><p></p><p>Sharing similar thoughts was the Ninth-Grade Sect, the Rainbow Pavilion!</p><p></p><p>At this time, a magnetic female voice rang out in the Rainbow Pavilion, "Do not act rashly. That Carefree Sect would not be so presumptuous if they did not have some strength. We of the Rainbow Pavilion shall just observe, the Blood Flame Pavilion and the Cosmic Veil Gate, those two arrogant sects, will surely pave the way for us."</p><p></p><p>"Yes, Pavilion Master," a melodious female voice responded.</p><p></p><p>The next day.</p><p></p><p>Outside the Carefree Sect,</p><p></p><p>Cultivators stood, hovered, or sat cross-legged in dense crowds.</p><p></p><p>Although their postures were different, the expressions on their faces were the same - they were dumbfounded, their eyes wide like copper bells, their mouths gaping wide enough to fit a goose egg.</p><p></p><p>This is a small sect? ? ?</p><p></p><p>This is way too grand! !</p><p></p><p>The sky was silent, and more and more cultivators came in batches to the outside of the Carefree Sect.</p><p></p><p>Originally, they had come to mock and then leave.</p><p></p><p>But now, they temporarily... did not want to leave.</p><p></p><p>At the same time, on the other side, outside the Blood Flame Pavilion, the Cosmic Veil Gate, and the Rainbow Pavilion, there were only a few cultivators standing at the mountain gates.</p><p></p><p>Some were kicking small stones on the ground, bored.</p><p></p><p>Some were staring blankly at the examination elders.</p><p></p><p>Others were just lost in thought.</p><p></p><p>A chilly morning breeze blew by, making the scene even more desolate.</p><p></p><p>These cultivators were also puzzled. They didn't know where everyone had gone, wasn't today the day the three major sects were recruiting disciples? Shouldn't it be crowded with people?</p><p></p><p>What's going on?</p><p></p><p>"Pavilion Master, Pavilion Master!! There are hardly any people coming for the examination today!!" </p><p></p><p>An elder shouted outside the courtyard of Fan Hong in the Blood Flame Pavilion.</p><p></p><p>The next moment, Fan Hong appeared before him, asking suspiciously, "What did you say?"</p><p></p><p>"There are... hardly any people coming for the examination..." the elder stammered.</p><p></p><p>Fan Hong's eyelid twitched, and he growled, "Where are the people?"</p><p></p><p>The elder dared not look at Fan Hong directly, and stammered again, "They... seem to be all at that Carefree Sect..."</p>

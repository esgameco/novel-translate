        <h1>Chapter 274</h1>
        <div class="content">
            <p>Here is the full English translation of the Chinese excerpt:</p><p></p><p>"What? Fu Shiyu, are you not satisfied?" </p><p></p><p>Liu Xing sneered coldly, mocking, "That's just the facts!"</p><p></p><p>Suddenly, a sword appeared in Fu Shiyu's hand, pointing directly at Liu Xing: "Liu Xing, you need not waste words. Today, dare you fight me? Whether dragon or insect, the world will judge for itself!"</p><p></p><p>Liu Xing's expression changed slightly. She didn't expect Fu Shiyu to suddenly become so unyielding. Although the Fu Clan had declined, this young master Fu Shiyu was indeed quite formidable.</p><p></p><p>To be honest, she was not certain she could defeat Fu Shiyu.</p><p></p><p>If she lost, her reputation would be greatly damaged!</p><p></p><p>But if she didn't accept the challenge, she would still lose face, which was unbearable.</p><p></p><p>The voices in the area quieted down, and countless gazes swept back and forth between Fu Shiyu and Liu Xing.</p><p></p><p>Many people's gazes towards Liu Xing already carried a hint of subtle mockery.</p><p></p><p>Sensing this, Liu Xing's slightly flushed face twitched, as she prepared to accept the challenge.</p><p></p><p>But just then, </p><p></p><p>Fu Liancai and a group of elders suddenly appeared by Fu Shiyu's side.</p><p></p><p>Whoa, the Clan Leader of the Fu Clan and the Fu Clan's upper echelons!</p><p></p><p>The crowd was stunned, slightly bowing their bodies. Although the Fu Clan had fallen, they were still not ordinary people to be trifled with!</p><p></p><p>Ouyang Jun, Liu Xing and the others also had their expressions change slightly. They didn't expect Fu Liancai, the Clan Leader, to actually come in person...</p><p></p><p>"Father!" Fu Tao hurriedly stepped forward, exclaiming joyfully.</p><p></p><p>"Clan Leader!" The clansmen also felt relieved in their hearts, cupping their fists in salute.</p><p></p><p>They knew that since the Clan Leader had arrived, there would be no more trouble today.</p><p></p><p>"Mm." Fu Liancai nodded slightly, his gaze, along with the elders', focusing on Lu Changsheng and Li Shueyan.</p><p></p><p>Fu Liancai's eyes flashed slightly as he looked deeply at the bronze mask, then smiled at Fu Shiyu, "Shiyu, who are these two?"</p><p></p><p>Fu Shiyu hesitated for a moment, glancing at Lu Changsheng, then said softly, "Father, now is not the time for idle chatter."</p><p></p><p>Hearing this, Fu Liancai nodded amiably towards Lu Changsheng and Li Shueyan, then turned around.</p><p></p><p>Looking at Ouyang Jun and Liu Xing, he narrowed his eyes slightly and said indifferently, </p><p></p><p>"Since the Clan Leader has not been greeted, is this how your elders have taught you etiquette?"</p><p></p><p>Ouyang Jun and Liu Xing's hearts suddenly jumped!</p><p>Facing the Clan Leader, it was impossible for them not to be nervous, after all, they were just juniors!</p><p></p><p>Ouyang Jun and Liu Xing couldn't withstand the pressure and were about to perform the greeting.</p><p></p><p>Suddenly, two more middle-aged men in embroidered robes appeared!</p><p></p><p>Boom!</p><p></p><p>The crowd was dumbfounded at this sight!</p><p></p><p>The Ouyang Clan Leader, the Liu Clan Leader!</p><p></p><p>What kind of day was this, that the three major Clan Leaders of Jingwun City had gathered together!!</p><p></p><p>Li Shueyan's hand holding Zhan Xu tightened!</p><p></p><p>These three Clan Leaders... were actually on par with the Saint-Emperor Realm experts of the Ancestral Celestial Realm!!</p><p></p><p>Their cultivation had almost caught up to his.</p><p></p><p>This Yongzhou Great Realm was truly terrifying. Upon just arriving, he had already encountered such figures.</p><p>It was as if they were everywhere.</p><p></p><p>Li Shueyan could hardly imagine how many more such powerful experts existed in this Yongzhou Great Realm - it was truly a daunting thought.</p><p></p><p>He had once been a Mirror Observation Monk of the Ancestral Celestial Realm, but now that he had come to this Yongzhou Great Realm, it seemed he would have great difficulty reaching the upper echelons here...</p><p></p><p>Thinking this, Li Shueyan glanced at the silent Lu Changsheng who seemed to be just watching the spectacle.</p><p></p><p>He felt slightly relieved.</p><p></p><p>At least, he had the Senior.</p><p></p><p>...</p><p></p><p>"Father!"</p><p>"Clan Leader!"</p><p></p><p>Ouyang Jun, Liu Xing and the others exclaimed joyfully, quickly performing the greeting.</p><p></p><p>Ouyang glared at Liu Qing beside him, then looked at the slightly somber-faced Fu Liancai and said leisurely:</p><p></p><p>"The Fu Clan Leader is of such status, yet he still deigns to exchange words with mere juniors?"</p><p></p><p>Fu Liancai's slight solemnness turned into a smile. "The Clan Leader would not stoop to compete with juniors. It's just that my clan's scions have arrived, and the Clan Leader happened to come to welcome them, only to see that you two families' juniors did not greet me."</p><p></p><p>Here is the full English translation of the Chinese excerpt:</p><p></p><p>"Whether it can be said or not, there are so many people watching here, I'm afraid it will give your two tribes a bad reputation... What do you two tribal leaders think?" </p><p></p><p>Ouyang Nuo and Liu Qing's eyes flashed, this Fu Liangcai never stops talking.</p><p></p><p>Now that the Fu Clan's Ancestor is still alive, they cannot completely tear off their faces.</p><p></p><p>So Ouyang Nuo took a light breath and smiled: "The Fu Clan has spoken too highly, Young Master Ou and Liu Xing, quickly go and pay respects to the Fu Clan Leader."</p><p></p><p>Ouyang Jun and Liu Xing sighed in their hearts, knowing that their elders still did not want to tear off their faces, and immediately went to pay respects to Fu Liangcai from afar:</p><p></p><p>"Greetings to the Fu Clan Leader."</p><p></p><p>"Hmph." Fu Liangcai knew he couldn't do anything to the two old foxes, and then said indifferently, "Return to your tribes."</p><p></p><p>The crowd on the city wall sighed with regret, all knowing that the Ouyang and Liu clans were not yet ready to completely tear off their faces with the Fu Clan.</p><p></p><p>Afterwards, Fu Liangcai and the others walked into the city under the gaze of the crowd, with Lu Changsheng and Li Shuyuan at the end.</p><p></p><p>"Hmm?"</p><p></p><p>Ouyang Nuo and Liu Qing's eyes flashed, their gaze falling on the receding figure of the man in blue.</p><p></p><p>"Who are those two? They are definitely not from the Fu Clan," Liu Qing said with a frown, looking at the direction the Fu Clan disappeared.</p><p></p><p>Ouyang Nuo's eyes darkened, his tone indifferent: "Whoever they are, as long as they don't go looking for trouble by interfering with the Fu Clan's affairs... Hmph."</p><p></p><p>Liu Qing paused, then nodded and smiled: "That's right."</p><p></p><p>"Father."</p><p></p><p>At this time, Ouyang Jun and Liu Xing stepped forward and bowed to greet them.</p><p></p><p>Slap!! Slap!!</p><p></p><p>Suddenly, Ouyang Nuo and Liu Qing slapped them simultaneously.</p><p></p><p>Ouyang Jun and Liu Xing were sent flying back, fortunately the clansmen behind them hurriedly caught them.</p><p></p><p>The two of them covered their swollen faces, momentarily dazed.</p><p></p><p>Outside the city, it became quiet.</p><p></p><p>On the city wall, the onlookers shuddered and dared not stay any longer, disappearing in an instant.</p><p></p><p>Some things are not meant to be watched.</p><p></p><p>Before Ouyang Jun and Liu Xing could be puzzled,</p><p></p><p>Ouyang Nuo growled, "Presuming to act on your own! Arrogant and conceited!"</p><p></p><p>"The Fu Clan is one of the three major clans, even though they have declined, the dying camel is still bigger than the horse. How dare you two juniors provoke them??"</p><p></p><p>Liu Qing also coldly stared at her son Liu Xing.</p><p></p><p>Liu Xing was lowered his head, trembling like a frightened cicada under her bone-chilling gaze.</p><p></p><p>"Father, Uncle Ou, Jun'er knows he was wrong..."</p><p></p><p>"Father, Uncle Liu, Xing'er knows he was wrong."</p><p></p><p>The two of them apologized in succession.</p><p></p><p>"Hmph! It's a good thing your father and your Uncle Liu came in time, otherwise if you had angered Fu Liangcai, you two young masters would have really died!"</p><p></p><p>"Now that the Fu Clan has fallen to this extent, don't think they won't dare to replace you two major clan young masters!"</p><p></p><p>"Hurry back to the clan, the sight of you is disgusting!"</p><p></p><p>Listening to Ouyang Nuo's furious scolding,</p><p></p><p>Not only Ouyang Jun and Liu Xing, but the rest of the crowd were all trembling.</p><p></p><p>...</p><p></p><p>In the Fu Clan.</p><p></p><p>After Fu Liangcai's group entered the hall, the atmosphere was slightly silent, indicating that everyone's mood was not good.</p><p></p><p>"Oh!"</p><p></p><p>Suddenly, Fu Liangcai slapped his forehead and turned around, his gaze falling on Lu Changsheng and Li Shuyuan, smiling and saying,</p><p></p><p>"You two, I'm very sorry, even though you came to visit my Fu Clan, such a disturbing incident happened, I'm embarrassed."</p><p></p><p>On the way back, his daughter had already sent him a message.</p><p></p><p>These two are outsiders who met in the void.</p><p></p><p>Especially the one in the lead, the young man in blue wearing a bronze mask, is very strong.</p><p></p><p>His cultivation level is even comparable to him, the Fu Clan Leader.</p><p></p><p>Such esteemed guests should be well received!</p><p></p><p>But the mysterious man in blue's next words left him and the others dumbfounded!</p><p></p><p>"Is there any way or means to see the Ancient Wasteland Sword Clan?"</p><p></p><p>The air fell silent, Fu Liangcai and the others were stunned!</p>

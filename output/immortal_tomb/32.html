        <h1>Chapter 32</h1>
        <div class="content">
            <p>Here is my translation of the Chinese excerpt:</p><p></p><p>The night was already deep. Only the town guards and the soldiers outside the town were vigilantly patrolling.</p><p></p><p>A spiritual boat appeared in the sky above Moyu Town, without attracting anyone's notice.</p><p></p><p>On the spiritual boat, Shen Miaoyun first looked at the countless tents outside the town, then looked towards Moyu Town and asked,</p><p></p><p>"Where does that cultivator live?"</p><p></p><p>Gu Helin replied: "Sect Master, the senior lives in the Magistrate's Mansion, but he may be resting now... Shall we wait until tomorrow to go see him?"</p><p></p><p>Shen Miaoyun glanced at Gu Helin and said, "You are always so considerate of that cultivator. Is he not my sect's senior? Moreover, what need does such a cultivator have for rest?"</p><p></p><p>The Second Elder coughed discreetly, sensing the situation was becoming delicate.</p><p></p><p>Gu Helin was silenced, and simply turned his head and lightly called out, "Tongxin, take the disciples and go cultivate in that forest over there."</p><p></p><p>Tongxin immediately stood up and bowed in acknowledgement.</p><p></p><p>He vaguely guessed that the Master was going to go see that senior...</p><p></p><p>He really wanted to go too...</p><p></p><p>"Sect Master, please follow me," said Gu Helin.</p><p></p><p>The next moment, the three of them lightly stepped over the railing and swooped down towards Moyu Town below, their robes billowing like flying immortals in the moonlight.</p><p></p><p>"Fellow disciples, don't keep looking, let's go," Tongxin said with a smile as he turned back to the eager disciples.</p><p></p><p>Then the spiritual boat slowly flew towards the distant forest, the same forest where Tongxin and Gu Helin had spent some time before.</p><p></p><p>...</p><p></p><p>At the Magistrate's Mansion, three figures appeared outside the back garden.</p><p></p><p>"Hmm? Such a dense demonic aura," Shen Miaoyun said, her gaze sharpening as she looked at the garden.</p><p></p><p>The Second Elder's expression also became slightly grave.</p><p></p><p>"Cough, Sect Master, Second Elder, this demonic aura should be from the Abyss Demon Spear that the senior has kept," Gu Helin said with a cough. After all, he had seen Lu Changsheng kick the Abyss Demon Spear back to the Magistrate's Mansion that day.</p><p></p><p>Shen Miaoyun and the Second Elder's brows relaxed, as they also recalled that Gu Helin had mentioned the senior taking the Abyss Demon Spear back in the sect.</p><p></p><p>This made sense.</p><p></p><p>"Let's go pay him a visit then," Shen Miaoyun said, about to step forward, but Gu Helin hesitated and blocked her path, "Sect Master, perhaps I should go greet the senior first?"</p><p></p><p>Shen Miaoyun paused, then helplessly said, "Alright, you go then."</p><p></p><p>She was tired.</p><p></p><p>"Yes." Gu Helin was delighted, and turned to enter the garden.</p><p></p><p>Shen Miaoyun's chest rose and fell slightly. "Second Elder, when have you seen Elder Gu be so careful and cautious with a cultivator?"</p><p></p><p>"Hehe," the Second Elder chuckled dryly. "Sect Master, after all, that senior did indirectly save Elder Gu's life, so it's understandable."</p><p></p><p>Hearing this, Shen Miaoyun nodded and said no more.</p><p></p><p>Meanwhile, as Gu Helin entered the garden, he immediately saw the Abyss Demon Spear suspended in the pavilion, emanating a chilling demonic aura.</p><p></p><p>Gu Helin's gaze narrowed slightly, and then he bowed and said, "Senior, Helin seeks an audience."</p><p></p><p>After a long while, Lu Changsheng's voice finally came.</p><p></p><p>"The night is already deep, come again tomorrow."</p><p></p><p>Gu Helin sighed inwardly, knowing his guess was correct, and then respectfully responded and left.</p><p></p><p>...</p><p></p><p>Shen Miaoyun and the Second Elder saw Gu Helin come out, and their brows both slightly furrowed.</p><p></p><p>They had a bad feeling about this.</p><p></p><p>Sure enough, they heard Gu Helin say awkwardly, "Sect Master, the senior has already retired for the night, let us come again tomorrow."</p><p></p><p>The Second Elder was slightly taken aback, and carefully glanced at Shen Miaoyun, only to see her expression had become even more indifferent than before.</p><p></p><p>And at that moment!</p><p></p><p>Here is the full English translation of the Chinese excerpt:</p><p></p><p>The face of the Second Elder changed slightly, and a talisman appeared between his fingers, suddenly bursting into flames!</p><p></p><p>Almost at the same time, three anxious voices sounded in the area.</p><p></p><p>"Second Elder, the Great Eternal Empire is in chaos, with heavy casualties, and we are a bit short-handed!"</p><p></p><p>"Second Elder, the Woodleaf Empire is in chaos..."</p><p></p><p>"Second Elder..."</p><p></p><p>Shen Miaojun and the other two knitted their brows and exchanged a glance.</p><p></p><p>The next moment, they soared into the sky and disappeared into the dark night.</p><p></p><p>...</p><p></p><p>The Demon Realm.</p><p></p><p>"After the last time, the Qingyun Sect must have taken precautions, focusing on defending against the Lishui Empire. This time, we'll directly target the few empires neighboring the Lishui Empire," Zhao Shenyuan's eyes flashed with mockery.</p><p></p><p>"Shenyuan, isn't this just luring the tiger away from the mountain?" Chu Qingcang frowned.</p><p></p><p>"Haha?" Zhao Shenyuan unexpectedly looked at the burly Chu Qingcang and laughed, "You big oaf, your brain is surprisingly quick today."</p><p></p><p>Hearing this, Chu Qingcang's face flushed with anger.</p><p></p><p>"Hehe."</p><p></p><p>The other three Demon Kings shook their heads and chuckled.</p><p></p><p>One of the Demon Kings in a black robe said, "Shenyuan, after the last time, do you think the people of the Qingyun Sect might have realized that we Demon Realm are plotting to seize the Immortal Tombs? If they discover our intentions, they would have surely informed the Spiritual Dust Cultivation World, wouldn't they?"</p><p></p><p>Zhao Shenyuan picked up the cup on the table, savoring a sip, and licked the remaining scarlet at the corners of his mouth with his tongue, smiling.</p><p></p><p>"Our intentions are so obvious, it's not surprising if someone with insight sees through them. But even if they do, so what?"</p><p></p><p>Hearing this, the four Demon Kings frowned, looking puzzled as they stared at Zhao Shenyuan.</p><p></p><p>They did not immediately refute Zhao Shenyuan's words, for Zhao Shenyuan was essentially the strategist of the Demon Realm.</p><p></p><p>This was the main reason he had earned the Supreme Demon Lord's appreciation.</p><p></p><p>"Hehe hehe."</p><p></p><p>Zhao Shenyuan let out a cold laugh, glancing at them and saying,</p><p></p><p>"You Demon Kings seem to have overestimated the Spiritual Dust Cultivation World. I dare to bet that even if the Qingyun Sect sees through our plot, they wouldn't dare to inform the Cultivation World."</p><p></p><p>"Wh-why?" Chu Qingcang was confused, feeling like something in his brain was burning.</p><p></p><p>"That's naturally because..."</p><p></p><p>Thereafter, Zhao Shenyuan explained to the four Demon Kings, his words essentially the same as what the ancient Crane had said in the Qingyun Sect's main hall that day.</p><p></p><p>The four Demon Kings' eyes grew brighter and brighter as they listened.</p><p></p><p>Indeed, the waters of the Spiritual Dust Cultivation World were very deep, with each sect and faction minding their own business.</p><p></p><p>Unlike them in the Demon Realm and Demon Beast Realm, where as long as the Demon Lord or Demon Beast Lord gave the order, tens of thousands of demons and beasts would not dare to disobey.</p><p></p><p>"Hehe, Shenyuan, no wonder you are the one the Demon Lord appreciates the most among us five. Your brain really is sharp," Chu Qingcang chuckled sheepishly.</p><p></p><p>Zhao Shenyuan rolled his eyes, not to be fooled by the simple-minded appearance of the man in front of him. Among the five Demon Kings, including himself, who could be considered simple?</p><p></p><p>As if thinking of something, Zhao Shenyuan's brows furrowed, and he said coldly,</p><p></p><p>"Last time, I lent the Abyss Demon Spear to the Black Tongue Demon Tribe Chief, but he and his tribe were killed in Lishui, and my Abyss Demon Spear was lost there, most likely seized by the cultivators of the Qingyun Sect!"</p><p></p><p>The four Demon Kings looked at each other, not expecting such a thing to have happened.</p><p></p><p>The Abyss Demon Spear was no ordinary demonic treasure, and they knew how important it was to Zhao Shenyuan.</p><p></p><p>"Shenyuan, what are you going to do about that?" Chu Qingcang asked curiously.</p><p></p><p>Zhao Shenyuan said in a chilling tone,</p><p></p><p>"This time, I have already sent the Nightmare Demon Tribe to occupy the Lishui Empire. If they can successfully seize the Abyss Demon Spear from the Qingyun Sect, that would be the best. If they cannot, it doesn't matter..."</p><p></p><p>"I will personally take action."</p>

        <h1>Chapter 135</h1>
        <div class="content">
            <p>Here is the full English translation of the Chinese excerpt:</p><p></p><p>Beyond the Five Great Immortal Realms. üëΩ‚ôõ‚ûÖ‚ùæ≈úùê°√πùêó.·ëï‡πèÔΩçüê∏‚ô°</p><p></p><p>The night sky covered the heavens, in a snowy mountain range.</p><p></p><p>A black gate suddenly appeared, and after Luchang Sheng and the others passed through, the black gate vanished again.</p><p></p><p>"Huh? Where are we? I don't remember it being even half an hour..." </p><p></p><p>Shi Wushi looked around and scratched his head, his gaze meeting only darkness and white snow.</p><p></p><p>The others also looked to Luchang Sheng, puzzled.</p><p></p><p>The area beyond the Five Great Immortal Realms was vast, and they only knew the path leading to the Divine Road, having not explored much else.</p><p></p><p>Luchang Sheng sat down on the ground, waving his hand to conjure a campfire. The warm glow immediately enveloped them, and he smiled, "We're now only halfway to the Divine Road, so we have plenty of time. Everyone can rest here for a while."</p><p></p><p>What? </p><p></p><p>In just a short while, they were already halfway to the Divine Road?</p><p></p><p>Shi Wushi and the others exchanged shocked glances.</p><p></p><p>"Tch, so-called Immortal Emperors, a bunch of country bumpkins. How could you possibly understand the master's capabilities?" </p><p></p><p>The old turtle patted his own back, then calmly sat down, acting all high and mighty.</p><p></p><p>Hearing this, the others felt slightly embarrassed, but soon gathered around the campfire and sat down.</p><p></p><p>"Haha, it's been a while since we've all sat together like this," Chu Lingian said with a smile, looking at Luchang Sheng.</p><p></p><p>Feng Jiu pursed her lips, her gaze also turning to Luchang Sheng. She then suddenly stood up and bowed deeply, sincerely saying, "Immortal Emperor Changsheng, without you, we can't even imagine how difficult the Immortal Tribulation and the Divine Road would have been. We've been relying on you all this time."</p><p></p><p>A moment of silence fell.</p><p></p><p>Chu Lingian and the others also stood up and bowed.</p><p></p><p>Seeing this, the old turtle inwardly cursed, these brats have made him feel awkward about just sitting there. Helplessly, he also stood up.</p><p></p><p>Luchang Sheng warmed his hands by the fire and said with a gentle smile, "As the Immortal Emperor of the Central Immortal Realm, this is simply my duty, no need for thanks."</p><p></p><p>"Sit down."</p><p></p><p>Everyone sat back down.</p><p></p><p>Shi Wushi scratched his head and changed the topic, laughing, "Immortal Emperor Changsheng, where did you go for the past hundred million years? We were all so worried about you back then."</p><p></p><p>Luchang Sheng shook his head, not answering the question, but instead said, "You are about to go to the Ancestral Heaven Realm. I'm afraid you will still face pressure there."</p><p></p><p>Chu Lingian clenched his fist and said in a stern voice, "Immortal Emperor Changsheng, don't worry. Once we're in the Ancestral Heaven Realm, under the Ancestral Heaven Emperor's watchful eye, those people won't dare to act so recklessly against us."</p><p></p><p>"That's right, they won't dare to be so outrageous anymore!" Shi Wushi also had a fierce look in his eyes.</p><p></p><p>"Once we establish a foothold there, we'll definitely repay them a hundredfold!" Ancient Yin and Yang gritted his teeth and said.</p><p></p><p>The Divine Road had been obstructed, and the Underworld Demon Clan had come to devour them, wanting to destroy the Five Great Immortal Realms. Anyone subjected to such oppression would be unable to endure it, let alone these Immortal Emperors of the Immortal Realms.</p><p></p><p>"Eh? But Immortal Emperor Changsheng, aren't you coming to the Ancestral Heaven Realm with us?" Shi Wushi suddenly realized and asked, puzzled.</p><p></p><p>Chu Lingian and the others also narrowed their eyes, looking at Luchang Sheng.</p><p></p><p>"The Ancestral Heaven Realm, I will not go there for now," Luchang Sheng said calmly.</p><p></p><p>The others wanted to ask more, but they saw Luchang Sheng wave his hand to extinguish the campfire.</p><p></p><p>The old turtle also quickly gestured for them to be silent.</p><p></p><p>Chu Lingian and the others were slightly surprised, and they all concealed their auras, making their bodies appear hazy and transparent, completely hiding themselves.</p><p></p><p>The surroundings fell silent once more.</p><p></p><p>Only a cold wind blew, creating a faint rustling sound.</p><p></p><p>Shhh...</p><p></p><p>Faint footsteps could be heard echoing around them.</p><p></p><p>Here is the full English translation of the excerpt from the Chinese novel:</p><p></p><p>With a penetrating smile and some words, </p><p></p><p>"Haha, haha, haha~"</p><p></p><p>"Hmm, there was definitely some movement here just now, but it's gone quiet again when we came over."</p><p></p><p>"Could it be just our imagination? This place has been devoid of any living beings for years."</p><p></p><p>"Nonsense, if it was just me, it might have been an illusion, but everyone else sensed it too."</p><p></p><p>These words echoed clearly in the ears of Lu Changsheng and the others.</p><p></p><p>In the direction Chu Lingian and the others were looking, they could clearly see a few white shadows wandering around nearby, as if searching for something...</p><p></p><p>The old turtle turned its head to look at Lu Changsheng, blinking its eyes, as if asking for instructions.</p><p></p><p>Then they saw Lu Changsheng's mouth curling into a smile as he nodded slightly.</p><p></p><p>The old turtle was immediately delighted, turning around and mockingly laughing, "Grandpa Turtle is here, you little demons, quickly come and kowtow!"</p><p></p><p>The words echoed clearly in the silent snowy mountain.</p><p></p><p>"Who's there!!!"</p><p></p><p>Immediately, the few white shadows gathered together like rabbits, warily watching Lu Changsheng's side.</p><p></p><p>But what puzzled them was that in their line of sight, there was nothing at all.</p><p></p><p>Time flew by second by second, and the few white shadows became increasingly nervous.</p><p></p><p>Logically speaking, this should be their territory, so they shouldn't be nervous.</p><p></p><p>Just as they were about to retreat and report to their elders,</p><p></p><p>they suddenly found themselves being picked up!</p><p></p><p>They were startled, turning their heads in horror, only to see an old man with long eyebrows and an ugly appearance grinning at them with a smile that looked like he was going to eat children.</p><p></p><p>"Mommy!!!"</p><p></p><p>Immediately, the few white creatures let out a shrill scream in fright.</p><p></p><p>But the next moment, they were thrown to the ground by the old turtle.</p><p></p><p>At the same time, Lu Changsheng waved his sleeve, and a pile of campfires suddenly ignited, illuminating the entire area.</p><p></p><p>The appearance of these four white creatures was instantly revealed to everyone.</p><p></p><p>Their white color was actually their entire body's fur, and their bodies were very round, looking almost like the snowmen piled up in winter at first glance.</p><p></p><p>"Who are you? Do you know this is the territory of our Snow Ball Tribe!"</p><p></p><p>They looked around in panic, finally fixing their gaze on the obviously leader-like Lu Changsheng.</p><p></p><p>"Snow Ball Tribe? How fitting." Lu Changsheng looked at them with amusement.</p><p></p><p>Chu Lingian and the others also curiously looked at the four snowmen in front of them. The Four Directions Immortal Realm is so vast, with countless races, and this was the first time they had heard of the Snow Ball Tribe.</p><p></p><p>"Hmph, you'd better release us quickly. You should know that our Snow Ball Tribe is extremely special in the Four Directions Immortal Realm, we even have ancestors serving in the Ancestral Heavenly Realm! You can't afford to offend us!"</p><p></p><p>One of the snowmen shouted arrogantly.</p><p></p><p>Huh???</p><p></p><p>Chu Lingian and the others were immediately shocked. They didn't expect the Snow Ball Tribe to have a spot to ascend to the Ancestral Heavenly Realm.</p><p></p><p>Lu Changsheng's eyes suddenly flashed as he glanced at Chu Lingian and the others, then asked, "In that case, your Snow Ball Tribe should have people ascending there regularly, so have any of your tribe members gone up there recently?"</p><p></p><p>The four snowmen looked at each other in dismay! </p><p></p><p>They were just junior members of the tribe, how would they know about such matters!</p><p></p><p>Lu Changsheng clapped his hands and stood up, saying,</p><p></p><p>"Old Turtle, take them with us, we're going to the Snow Ball Tribe."</p><p></p><p>"Understood!"</p><p></p><p>The old turtle immediately pointed a finger, and green rope bindings wrapped around the four snowmen.</p><p></p><p>"Senior Immortal Emperor, you..." Chu Lingian was somewhat puzzled.</p><p></p><p>Lu Changsheng replied indifferently, "After you go to the Ancestral Heavenly Realm, having more allies means more paths."</p><p></p><p>The four were stunned for a moment, their eyes welling up with tears.</p><p>They had truly grown to love Lu Changsheng deeply.</p>

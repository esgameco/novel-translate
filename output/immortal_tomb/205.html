        <h1>Chapter 205</h1>
        <div class="content">
            <p>Here is the full English translation of the Chinese excerpt:</p><p></p><p>Time flew by in a flash, and 13 days had passed. üê®üçü‚ûÖ‚ùæ≈üùî•·ªÆ‚ìß.Ôº£ùìûùïûüê§üêº</p><p></p><p>There were only two days left before the start of the Nine Realms Sect Competition.</p><p></p><p>At this very moment, a gentle and low-pitched voice descended from the sky in the Extreme Cold Glacier,</p><p></p><p>"Attention all sects, there are only two days left, everyone, keep up the effort..."</p><p></p><p>Hearing this, the sects rushing through the Extreme Cold Glacier were stunned.</p><p></p><p>The voice that made the announcement used to be extremely stern and loud, but why was it so gentle this time?</p><p></p><p>This left the sects completely perplexed.</p><p></p><p>However, they had no time to dwell on this, as the time they had left was truly limited.</p><p></p><p>.........</p><p></p><p>On the afternoon of the second-to-last day, sects gradually arrived at the central area one after another.</p><p></p><p>Everyone was disheveled and in disarray.</p><p></p><p>When they saw the magnificent palace suspended in the air before them, they finally heaved a sigh of relief.</p><p></p><p>They began to sit down and restore their spiritual energy.</p><p></p><p>Among them, the Blood Flame Sect and the Rainbow Pavilion had also successfully arrived, but the Forestry Gate was still nowhere to be seen.</p><p></p><p>Finally, at the very last moment of the final day,</p><p></p><p>just as the Carefree Sect entered,</p><p></p><p>Boom!!</p><p></p><p>A bell suddenly rang out.</p><p></p><p>Many sects that had not yet arrived were immediately dejected, especially those who were just short of the destination, who were utterly dispirited.</p><p></p><p>The members of the Carefree Sect looked around, their hearts slightly shocked,</p><p></p><p>because the total number of sects that had arrived before the deadline was less than one-tenth of the initial number.</p><p></p><p>Just traversing the Extreme Cold Glacier had eliminated more than nine-tenths of the sects!</p><p></p><p>"The sects that did not make it to the central area can either retreat or continue to come here to observe. Although they have lost the qualification, they have gained experience, and I believe that in the next Grand Competition of the Myriad Sects, you will make further progress," a gentle voice resounded from the sky, reaching the ears of all the sects.</p><p></p><p>Hearing this, the countless sects that had lost their qualification in the Extreme Cold Glacier quickly calmed their emotions and continued towards the central area. Since they had come this far, they naturally couldn't just turn back, and they had to observe the competition.</p><p></p><p>.........</p><p></p><p>In the central area of the Extreme Cold Glacier, less than a thousand sects stood solemnly, their eyes frantically scrutinizing each other, each harboring their own thoughts.</p><p></p><p>After all, the sects present at this moment were their true opponents!</p><p></p><p>Outside the central area, there were even more sects observing, dense and numerous, nearly ten times the number inside.</p><p></p><p>In the Blood Flame Sect's camp,</p><p></p><p>"Sect Leader, the Carefree Sect has also successfully arrived!"</p><p></p><p>Elder Chen He, with the corner of his eye, spotted the Carefree Sect, and his heart was shaken as he transmitted a message.</p><p></p><p>"I've seen it," Fan Hong's face was grave as he said, "The Carefree Sect has indeed been hiding their true strength..."</p><p></p><p>At this moment,</p><p></p><p>the doors of the suspended palace in front opened, and seven figures slowly walked out.</p><p></p><p>Seeing this, everyone was startled.</p><p></p><p>Soon, the seven people stopped, and the one in the lead, Fu Ming-yan, took a step forward, looking down at all the sects.</p><p></p><p>His gaze swept across everyone at an incredible speed, and he heaved a sigh of relief when he did not see the strange and powerful man in blue.</p><p></p><p>Then he smiled faintly and said, "I am the Ninth Elder of the Mysterious Fire Sect, and I will be presiding over this Nine Realms Sect Competition."</p><p></p><p>The Mysterious Fire Sect, a First-Rank Sect!!</p><p></p><p>Everyone present had their pupils constrict, their hearts pounding in fear.</p><p></p><p>No one had expected that this Nine Realms Sect Competition would be presided over by an Elder of the Mysterious Fire Sect, which was such a high-ranking sect!</p><p></p><p>"Hehe, the rewards for the top hundred in this Nine Realms Sect Competition will be bestowed by my Mysterious Fire Sect," Fu Ming-yan waved his hand, about to continue speaking.</p><p></p><p>Here is the full English translation of the Chinese excerpt:</p><p></p><p>He was stunned the moment he saw it!</p><p></p><p>What did he see?!</p><p></p><p>He saw the group of four people from the Leiyu faction who had just entered the central area!</p><p></p><p>Leiyu and Leiying, as the Ninth Elder of the Xuanhuozong, he naturally recognized them!</p><p></p><p>Fu Mingyan immediately flashed his figure and appeared in front of the group of four Leiyu people amidst numerous astonished gazes.</p><p></p><p>Everyone looked at the group of Leiyu people with doubt and bewilderment!</p><p></p><p>But Fu Mingyan's next actions and words shocked them.</p><p></p><p>Fu Mingyan cupped his hands and smiled, "Haha, I didn't expect the Junior Sect Master of the Leiyu Sect to personally come and watch the competition of our humble Ninth-Grade Sect."</p><p></p><p>Everyone was stunned as they looked at Leiyu.</p><p></p><p>Whoa, the Junior Sect Master of the Leiyu Sect!</p><p></p><p>To make the Ninth Elder of the Xuanhuozong so polite, and with the surname Lei, everyone immediately thought of the great Leiyu Sect in their domain!!</p><p></p><p>The three First-Grade Sects in their domain are the Xuanhuozong, the Dariyu Sect, and the Tianjian Pavilion, among which... the Dariyu Sect is the most prominent!</p><p></p><p>On the Xiaoyao Sect side, disciples like Tong Xin and Lin Dong also suddenly looked at Leiyu!</p><p></p><p>Their gazes were no longer relaxed, but became solemn, filled with a fighting spirit!</p><p></p><p>The Dariyu Sect must be behind them, and they will definitely clash with the Xiaoyao Sect!!</p><p></p><p>Elder Peng and the others sensed the fighting spirit of Tong Xin, Lin Dong, and the others, and the corners of their mouths curled up, "That's right, just like this!"</p><p></p><p>"Elder Fu, you're too polite. My junior sister and I have come here this time to relax a bit." Leiyu cupped his hands and smiled gracefully, "Elder Fu should continue with the competition. If we delay the progress of the competition, I'm afraid I'll be held responsible."</p><p></p><p>Upon hearing this, the impression of Leiyu in the eyes of the various sects immediately rose to an extremely high level.</p><p></p><p>As the future sect master of the Dariyu Sect, he was neither arrogant nor overbearing.</p><p></p><p>In an instant, the sect masters present began to transmit voice messages to educate their own geniuses, letting them see the Leiyu Junior Sect Master, and then look at their own unworthy selves!!</p><p></p><p>Many geniuses of the various sects felt ashamed. Some of them had been acting recklessly and arrogantly in their own domains, relying on the fact that they were geniuses of Ninth-Grade Sects.</p><p></p><p>Compared to the Junior Sect Master of a First-Grade Sect, whether in terms of strength or character and demeanor, they were indeed vastly different.</p><p></p><p>They asked themselves sincerely, if they were to switch identities with the Leiyu Junior Sect Master and come to this Extreme Cold Ice Field, they would probably also act recklessly and arrogantly, otherwise they would feel uncomfortable in their hearts...</p><p></p><p>Fu Mingyan also looked at Leiyu with admiration, sighing inwardly that he was truly the Junior Sect Master and top genius of the Dariyu Sect. Compared to Leiyu, the top geniuses of his Xuanhuozong were still a step behind.</p><p></p><p>"Junior Sect Master Leiyu, Miss Leiying, please come and sit with this Elder in the palace above, the view is better up there." Fu Mingyan gestured invitingly.</p><p></p><p>Leiyu did not refuse politely, and he and Leiying followed Fu Mingyan towards the palace.</p><p></p><p>At the same time, his peripheral vision swept across the entire venue.</p><p></p><p>Seeing no trace of that figure in blue, he felt a sense of regret and disappointment in his heart, for reasons he did not know.</p><p></p><p>After Fu Mingyan led the group of four Leiyu people to their seats, he returned to the front and said, "I won't say much more. The rules for this Ninth-Grade Sect Competition are..."</p><p></p><p>But before Fu Mingyan could finish speaking, Peng, who was at the forefront of the Xiaoyao Sect, stood up and interrupted him.</p><p></p><p>"Wait a moment."</p><p></p><p>Fu Mingyan was startled.</p><p></p><p>The group of four Leiyu people were also taken aback.</p><p></p><p>All the people present were stunned, and countless questioning gazes were directed towards the Xiaoyao Sect camp, focused on the figure of Peng at the forefront.</p><p></p><p>The disciples of Fanzhai and Chen He from the Blood Flame Pavilion were surprised and secretly delighted.</p><p></p><p>This Xiaoyao Sect Sect Master, his brain doesn't seem to be very smart.</p><p></p><p>Who does he think he is?</p><p></p><p>Daring to interrupt the words of an Elder of the Xuanhuozong!</p>

        <h1>Chapter 91</h1>
        <div class="content">
            <p>Here is the full English translation of the Chinese excerpt:</p><p></p><p>In the Eastern Domain, at the Purple Extreme Thunder Peak.</p><p></p><p>Countless cultivators were soaring outside the mountain peaks, some riding swords, some flying carpets, some spirit boats, and so on, in a grand and majestic manner!</p><p></p><p>These were all cultivators from the various sects of the Eastern Domain, ranging from the early Foundation Establishment stage to those in the middle stage of Tribulation Crossing, their faces revealing a sense of coldness and discontent.</p><p></p><p>This recent demonic invasion had caused massive losses to both the mortal world and the immortal cultivation world of the Eastern Domain. During this time, the Purple Extreme Thunder Peak had not taken any action, which greatly displeased them!</p><p></p><p>Thus, they gathered together to demand an explanation.</p><p></p><p>"You, the Purple Extreme Thunder Peak, as the number one sect in the Eastern Domain, have not taken any action during this demonic invasion. You must provide an explanation!!"</p><p></p><p>"That's right! I was at the Tribulation Crossing site in the Western Domain, and Elder Jiang Yuan clearly said he would come back to provide support, but we all arrived, yet we did not see Elder Jiang Yuan. With Elder Jiang Yuan's peak Tribulation Crossing cultivation, shouldn't he have been faster than us?"</p><p></p><p>"It would have been understandable if Elder Jiang Yuan did not take action, but the fact that not a single person from the Purple Extreme Thunder Peak came out is simply unacceptable. To put it bluntly, not even a Foundation Establishment disciple was dispatched! Isn't this going too far!"</p><p></p><p>"Hehe, we all know the Purple Extreme Thunder Peak is powerful, but this time, you must give us an explanation!"</p><p></p><p>The cultivators spoke one after another, their words crashing down upon the Purple Extreme Thunder Peak like a torrential flood.</p><p></p><p>However, it was only words, without any further action.</p><p></p><p>After all, the Purple Extreme Thunder Peak was a formidable entity, and they were deeply wary of it, especially of Elder Jiang Yuan.</p><p></p><p>Meanwhile, inside the Purple Extreme Thunder Peak.</p><p></p><p>The main hall was deathly silent.</p><p></p><p>The elders stood on both sides, listening to the waves of discontent, their expressions somewhat unsightly.</p><p></p><p>"Sect Master, what is the meaning of all this? I had previously said that if the demonic threat was resolved, the Purple Extreme Thunder Peak would surely be criticized. Can you tell us what's going on?"</p><p></p><p>"Yes, if this continues, the reputation of our Purple Extreme Thunder Peak in the Eastern Domain will plummet. Alas!"</p><p></p><p>"If this news spreads to the other three domains, we will be the laughingstock of everyone."</p><p></p><p>"..."</p><p></p><p>Quickly, the elders began to voice their doubts and dissatisfaction.</p><p></p><p>Until now, they still did not understand the reason behind the Sect Master's order for the entire sect to not go out and provide support on that day when the demonic threat occurred.</p><p></p><p>They felt they were being kept in the dark.</p><p></p><p>"Elders, please calm down," Li Ling frowned as he looked at the elders and waved his hand.</p><p></p><p>Immediately, the elders fell silent, but they continued to stare at Li Ling, waiting for his explanation.</p><p></p><p>This was such a big matter, and if Li Ling could not provide a satisfactory explanation, they had the right to unite and report to Elder Jiang Yuan, which would put Li Ling's position as Sect Master at risk of being removed.</p><p></p><p>"Elders, you need not think about uniting to report to the Elder and remove me as Sect Master. This order... was given directly by the Elder himself."</p><p></p><p>Li Ling said calmly.</p><p></p><p>The elders looked at each other in silence, they had nothing to say.</p><p></p><p>Although their hearts were filled with doubts, they dared not disobey Jiang Yuan.</p><p></p><p>"And you all need not ask our sect, for we also do not know the Elder's intentions," Li Ling interrupted an elder who was about to speak.</p><p></p><p>Looking at the now silent elders, Li Ling stood up and said in a solemn voice, "Follow me to go see the other sects of the Eastern Domain."</p><p></p><p>With that, his figure flashed as he took the lead in leaving the Purple Extreme Thunder Peak.</p><p></p><p>...</p><p></p><p>In the Demonic Realm.</p><p></p><p>"Demonic Sovereign, your demonic realm's..."</p><p></p><p>Here is the full English translation of the Chinese excerpt:</p><p></p><p>"We have lost two Demon Kings, and countless demonic beasts have been killed in battle... If the strength of the Demon Realm is only this much, I'm not sure if I can continue to cooperate with you," the middle-aged man in plain robes said calmly as he poured himself a cup of tea.</p><p></p><p>"Jiang Yuan, what do you mean by that?" Tiger Battle's eyes narrowed as he spoke in a deep voice.</p><p></p><p>Jiang Yuan took a sip of tea and said coldly, "Do you know what I have sacrificed to cooperate with your Demon Realm? If this matter fails, not only will my Purple Extreme Thunder Peak become the target of criticism, but the news will also spread to other realms, and Qin Miaomiao and Liu Wusu will surely suspect me."</p><p></p><p>Tiger Battle laughed, "It was you who came to seek cooperation in the first place. Moreover, you only promised to keep your Purple Extreme Thunder Peak idle, and you didn't even have to take action. You easily obtained one-tenth of the secret of the Immortal Tomb, yet you still dare to be dissatisfied?"</p><p></p><p>Upon hearing this, Jiang Yuan's eyes flickered, and he raised four fingers.</p><p></p><p>"What do you mean?" Tiger Battle's expression changed slightly.</p><p></p><p>Jiang Yuan said, "I want four-tenths."</p><p></p><p>Boom! Tiger Battle slammed his hand on the table and stood up, growling, "Four-tenths? You haven't done anything, yet you want four-tenths? Do you think I, the Demon Lord, won't kill you right here in the Demon Realm?"</p><p></p><p>"Hehe, Demon Lord, don't be angry. I naturally don't want to eat food that comes too easily. What I mean to say is, now that the blood energy in the Eastern Domain has not yet dissipated, let's work together to conquer the Eastern Domain, and then gradually break through the Southern, Western, and Northern Domains. When the blood energy fills the sky, won't we be able to open the Immortal Tomb?"</p><p></p><p>Jiang Yuan smiled calmly.</p><p></p><p>Tiger Battle paused for a moment, then sat down and smiled satisfactorily, "I knew that you, Jiang Yuan, with your ambition, would not be satisfied with just one-tenth."</p><p></p><p>He then sighed, "It's just a pity that Empress Wuqing is too cautious. Otherwise, with Empress Wuqing joining us, the Spiritual Dust Realm could be conquered in an instant."</p><p></p><p>Jiang Yuan asked puzzledly, "I've long wanted to ask about this. Why, with the Demon Lord's strength, is he so cautious?"</p><p></p><p>"Because of a person."</p><p></p><p>"Who?"</p><p></p><p>"Lu Changsheng."</p><p></p><p>"..."</p><p></p><p>Jiang Yuan's eyes flashed with a sharp light, and he slowly put down his teacup, staring at Tiger Battle and saying, "The Lu Changsheng you mentioned, could it be the young Taoist cultivator in blue robes?"</p><p></p><p>Tiger Battle was taken aback and quickly said, "That's right! That Lu Changsheng is the one in blue robes, and he also has a strange turtle. Have you seen that turtle?"</p><p></p><p>"I haven't seen any turtle," Jiang Yuan shook his head in confusion.</p><p></p><p>Tiger Battle's head drooped in disappointment, and he said regretfully, "That's a pity."</p><p></p><p>The next moment, he suddenly raised his head and said, "From your words, it seems you've also met that Lu Changsheng?"</p><p></p><p>Jiang Yuan nodded slightly, his eyes deep as he said, "If my guess is correct, that should be the Lu Changsheng you and the Demon Lord have been talking about. What is special about him?"</p><p></p><p>Tiger Battle pondered and said, "There is. That turtle of his gives me a feeling... I don't know if you'll believe it, but that turtle gives me a feeling of danger."</p><p></p><p>"Demon Lord, stop joking around. I don't have time to chat with you about these useless things," Jiang Yuan frowned, a little impatient. What kind of turtle is this? This Tiger Battle has really gone crazy, his brain is sick!</p><p></p><p>Tiger Battle, seeing this, also didn't feel like saying more, feeling like he was talking to a deaf person. He then said, "You may not have been to the Immortal Tomb for a long time. You should know that one of the tombs there has disappeared."</p><p></p><p>"And the Demon Lord, I don't know if she's gone crazy or what, but she actually said that this Lu Changsheng is the master of the disappeared Immortal Tomb. It's ridiculous. Although at the time, the Demon Lord had her arm severed, and she said it was done by this Lu Changsheng, and it still hasn't grown back even now. I don't know if what she said is true or not."</p><p></p><p>Jiang Yuan slowly stood up, his face grave and full of incredulity.</p><p></p><p>"The disappeared Immortal Tomb? The master of the Immortal Tomb?"</p>

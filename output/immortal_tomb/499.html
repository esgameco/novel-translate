        <h1>Chapter 499</h1>
        <div class="content">
            <p>Here is the full English translation of the Chinese excerpt:</p><p></p><p>In the venue, the laws of light were extremely dense!</p><p></p><p>The expressions of the crowd kept changing!</p><p></p><p>Except for the president of the Maritime Merchants Association and the Holy King of the Land, whose expressions remained unchanged, the rest of the crowd were secretly alarmed!</p><p></p><p>The Chu Clan Chief had reached the peak of the Nine Heavenly Transformations! One more step, and he would comprehend the profound mysteries of the laws of light!</p><p></p><p>"Chu Clan Chief! Don't get so excited! Let's talk it through!"</p><p></p><p>"Yes, Chu Clan Chief, the situation is still unclear, so please don't act rashly!"</p><p></p><p>"We, the nine peak forces, jointly control the central territory of Dengtiandao. If there were no good reason, how could we possibly attack your Chu Clan?"</p><p></p><p>"......"</p><p></p><p>The leaders of the eight peak forces knew they were in the wrong, and they tried to persuade him one after another.</p><p></p><p>At this moment, another message came from Dengtiandao, and the crowd took out their communication jade plates, and the content echoed.</p><p></p><p>The Chu Clan Chief's expression became extremely unsightly!</p><p></p><p>A young man in blue robes!!</p><p></p><p>The leaders of the eight peak forces suddenly became delighted, and they said one after another:</p><p></p><p>"Chu Clan Chief, you see, our Patriarch just said there was a reason for this!"</p><p></p><p>"We nine forces have always been in harmony, how could we possibly unite to target your Chu Clan?"</p><p></p><p>"Old Chu, the situation is now very clear, they were all forced by a young man in blue robes!"</p><p></p><p>"Yes! In such a situation, did they have a choice?"</p><p></p><p>"That's right! The culprit is clear, you Chu Clan should go find that mysterious young man in blue and settle the score!"</p><p></p><p>"By the way, Old Chu, that mysterious young man in blue is obviously targeting your Chu Clan. Think carefully, has your Chu Clan offended anyone recently?"</p><p></p><p>"......"</p><p></p><p>Although the Chu Clan Chief's expression had improved a little and his rationality had returned, he was still full of dissatisfaction, hatred, and ruthlessness:</p><p></p><p>"My Chu Clan has nothing to do with any blue-robed cultivator. Regardless, the disciples of my Chu Clan were killed by you eight families on Dengtiandao, and you must compensate us!"</p><p></p><p>The Chu Clan Chief did not know that at this moment, behind him, Chu You's expression had become abnormal, and his pupils had contracted deeply!</p><p></p><p>A young man in blue robes... a young man in blue robes!</p><p></p><p>Chu You immediately thought of Lü Changsheng from the Qiankun Heavens!</p><p></p><p>Could it really be that Lü Changsheng had come to the Three Thousand Realms?</p><p></p><p>Impossible, absolutely impossible!</p><p></p><p>How could that Lü Changsheng have such capabilities to coerce the eight forces of Dengtiandao to attack his Chu Clan?</p><p></p><p>The eight forces' expressions turned unpleasant when they heard this.</p><p></p><p>They were only being so polite because they had two Dao Realm experts present and they felt guilty in their hearts. But if the Chu Clan wanted to make unreasonable demands, they would definitely not agree.</p><p></p><p>At most, one of the peak forces would be eliminated from the Sea of Laws!</p><p></p><p>"Oh? What kind of compensation does the Chu Clan Chief want from us eight families? If it's within our capabilities, we can consider it."</p><p></p><p>The Demon-Subduing Valley Master said indifferently.</p><p></p><p>Seeing this, the Chu Clan Chief suppressed his emotions and began to ponder, and the venue became quiet for a moment.</p><p></p><p>At the same time, at the entrance of the Elf Clan.</p><p></p><p>A young man in blue robes and an old man appeared, which were the summoned Lü Changsheng and the Old Turtle.</p><p></p><p>The two male Elf Clan cultivators at the entrance saw this and exchanged a puzzled glance, then stepped forward and bowed slightly, asking, "May I ask if you two esteemed guests are here to attend the ceremony?"</p><p></p><p>The Old Turtle waved his hand and said, "That's right, I and the master have come to attend the ceremony. Hurry up and have your Clan Chief come out to welcome us!"</p><p></p><p>The two male Elf Clan cultivators' pupils suddenly contracted.</p><p></p><p>How arrogant was this?</p><p></p><p>The leaders of the nine peak forces were already in the venue, and the President of the Maritime Merchants Association and the Holy King of the Land were also among them.</p><p></p><p>They really couldn't think of anyone in the Three Thousand Realms, other than the three Dao Realm Patriarchs of the Demon-Subduing Valley, the Nine Abyss Underworld Palace, and the Chu Clan, who would have the qualifications to have the Elf Clan Chief personally welcome them.</p><p></p><p>And those three Dao Realm Patriarchs, the two male Elf Clan cultivators had all seen them before.</p><p></p><p>Clearly, the young man in blue robes was not among them!</p><p></p><p>Of course, more importantly, according to the rules, they could no longer enter the venue at this time.</p><p></p><p>"Sorry, according to the rules, after the ceremony has begun, no one is allowed to enter the venue. How about this, you two can first come with us to the clan to rest?"</p><p></p><p>One of the male Elf Clan cultivators apologized.</p><p></p><p>The Old Turtle's gaze narrowed, he was afraid that Lü Changsheng would be impatient, and he was about to strike down these two Elf Clan cultivators.</p><p></p><p>The two Elf Clan cultivators were taken aback, and immediately took up a defensive stance, ready to face a powerful enemy.</p><p></p><p>At this moment, Qing and Lin hurriedly arrived, and as soon as they arrived, they saw this scene that made their hearts tremble!</p><p></p><p>"Senior, please wait!"</p><p></p><p>Hearing this, the Old Turtle frowned and looked at the approaching Qing and Lin, slowly putting down his hand.</p><p></p><p>"Miss Qing, Miss Lin!"</p><p></p><p>The two Elf Clan cultivators...</p><p></p><p>Here is the full English translation of the Chinese excerpt:</p><p></p><p>The male cultivator saw this and was delighted, quickly bowing.</p><p></p><p>Although Qing and Lin's cultivation was not yet strong, they were the new generation of the Elf Clan and were greatly favored by the Elf Clan Elders.</p><p></p><p>However, Qing and Lin did not pay attention to them, and the first thing they did was to respectfully bow to Lu Changsheng:</p><p></p><p>"Great One, the ignorant members of the Elf Clan will be properly disciplined according to the clan laws afterwards. Qing and Lin will escort the Great One into the venue!"</p><p></p><p>Hearing this, the two male cultivators of the Elf Clan who were bowing their heads were shocked and felt bitter, knowing that they had offended a powerful figure.</p><p></p><p>"No matter, let's go in."</p><p></p><p>Lu Changsheng smiled.</p><p></p><p>"Yes."</p><p></p><p>Seeing Lu Changsheng's smile, Qing and Lin felt slightly relieved, and then glared at the two male cultivators, inviting Lu Changsheng to enter the clan.</p><p></p><p>"Miss Lin, who is this Great One exactly......"</p><p></p><p>One of the Elf Clan male cultivators couldn't help but transmit a voice to ask.</p><p></p><p>"This Azure-robed Great One is an Arcane-level expert. You two just wait for your punishment."</p><p></p><p>When Lin's voice transmission came, the two Elf Clan members' faces turned deathly pale, as if they were facing their own funeral.</p><p></p><p>This time, they would either die or be severely punished.</p><p></p><p>...</p><p></p><p>In the venue.</p><p></p><p>"Impossible! This is an outrageous demand from your Chu Clan! We've already said that the members of our Dengtiandao were coerced by the Azure-robed man, so what does it have to do with us?"</p><p></p><p>"That's right, if your Chu Clan makes such an outrageous demand, then let's fight. We don't want to show any more courtesy!"</p><p></p><p>"If you have the ability, go settle the score with the Azure-robed man!"</p><p></p><p>"......"</p><p></p><p>As expected, the Chu Clan Elder's compensation demand was rejected.</p><p></p><p>The Chu Clan Elder became furious and shouted, "No matter what, the people were killed by the Eight Families, so some compensation must be paid, right?"</p><p></p><p>"As for that Azure-robed man, you don't even need to mention him!!"</p><p></p><p>"As soon as the ceremony is over, my Chu Clan will issue a bounty warrant throughout the Three Thousand Realms! That person will definitely be publicly executed by my Chu Clan!!"</p><p></p><p>Suddenly, the sound of footsteps outside attracted everyone's attention, and then a arrogant voice came first:</p><p></p><p>"No need to issue a bounty, my master has already arrived. You mortals, hurry and prostrate yourselves!"</p><p></p><p>Ever since the old turtle knew about Lu Changsheng's prowess, as his mount, he naturally became extremely arrogant, even more so than before!</p><p></p><p>What? That Azure-robed man has come?!</p><p></p><p>You mortals? Hurry and prostrate yourselves?</p><p></p><p>Arrogant, extremely arrogant!</p><p></p><p>Presumptuous, beyond measure!</p><p></p><p>But the moment the Azure-robed man entered the sight of the crowd!</p><p></p><p>A pressure, as if overwhelmingly powerful, without any boundaries, suddenly suppressed the entire venue!!</p><p></p><p>Boom!!</p><p></p><p>Including the Chamber of Commerce Chairman and the Sacred King of the Continent, all their faces changed drastically!</p><p></p><p>The next moment, they all knelt down heavily!</p><p></p><p>Countless terrified gazes were cast towards the Azure-robed man, their souls trembling!</p><p></p><p>Even the two Arcane-level experts had pale faces, their expressions filled with disbelief!</p><p></p><p>At this moment, only Chu Yu seemed unaffected by the pressure, standing there blankly.</p><p></p><p>Chu Yu looked around the venue, seeing the kneeling crowd, and his heart pounded. He finally shifted his gaze to the Azure-robed man, and his expression changed to one of horror, his entire body trembling uncontrollably!</p><p></p><p>As for Qing and Lin behind Lu Changsheng, they had already frozen there, their gazes fixed rigidly on the Azure-robed back, their spirits shaking!</p><p></p><p>"Haha, didn't I tell you to hurry and prostrate yourselves to welcome him? My master can crush this world with just a finger! Not to mention you insignificant mortals! There are heavens beyond heavens, and people beyond people, understand? You bunch of trash!"</p><p></p><p>The old turtle laughed loudly, after flattering, he looked at Lu Changsheng and flattered, "Master, is what I said right?"</p><p></p><p>Lu Changsheng didn't bother to respond to the old turtle's nonsense, but instead raised his gaze to the trembling and chaotic Chu Yu in front of him, and smiled lightly.</p><p></p><p>"I still appreciate your defiant and unruly demeanor..."</p><p></p><p>He then said with interest, "I just thought of a fun game. If you can withstand the pressure from me and restore your former unruly self, I will spare you and the Chu Clan."</p><p></p><p>"But if you fail to recover, then you will all die."</p><p></p><p>"How about it? Shall we play? Don't say I didn't give you a chance."</p>

        <h1>Chapter 241</h1>
        <div class="content">
            <p>Here is the full English translation of the Chinese excerpt:</p><p></p><p>After a cathartic outburst, </p><p></p><p>Yang Qiuyang's mouth curled into a smile, ah, much more relieved. üë£üç≠Ôºñ‚ùæ·îïùêáùìæùîÅ.·ëïœÉŒúüëª‚õµ</p><p></p><p>After leaving the medical clinic, he truly hated himself, hated that he had become infatuated with a hypocritical scoundrel, and had almost been killed by this scoundrel, although there was also a bit of selfishness involved, but it was undeniable that he had once genuinely liked Su Lianyi.</p><p></p><p>After coming to his senses, now thinking about it, his former self had really given too much face to this scoundrel.</p><p></p><p>What status and position did he, Yang Qiuyang, have?</p><p></p><p>And what status and position did this Su Lianyi have?</p><p></p><p>The difference between the Sect Master and the Holy Maiden!</p><p></p><p>He had really given her too much face!</p><p></p><p>The jade token's light flickered slightly, indicating that the connection had not yet been severed, but there was no sound coming from the other side, </p><p></p><p>Clearly, under this sudden barrage, Su Lianyi was dazed.</p><p></p><p>She had never seen this side of Yang Qiuyang before.</p><p></p><p>In the past, he had always been extremely accommodating towards her.</p><p></p><p>"What do you mean by your previous words?" Su Lianyi tried to remain calm.</p><p></p><p>"Our sect no longer wishes to waste words with you, even a single word spoken with you feels like a loss of dignity."</p><p></p><p>Yang Qiuyang said this sentence and then actively cut off the transmission.</p><p></p><p>He knew that Su Lianyi would not come out, since that was the case, further discussion was useless.</p><p></p><p>He suddenly let out a loud shout:</p><p></p><p>"All the elders gather, follow me to the Upper Clear Palace!!"</p><p></p><p>.........</p><p></p><p>Upper Clear Palace.</p><p></p><p>Yun Mi had a headache.</p><p></p><p>Previously, she had gone to the Seven Emotions Valley, and the other party was so angry that they almost started fighting directly.</p><p></p><p>The other party gritted their teeth and said that Yun Mi had indiscriminately poured the pollution of the Seven Emotions Valley onto them.</p><p></p><p>After the endless argument, the Seven Emotions Valley master retreated a step and agreed to do a heart-to-heart, on the condition that if the Upper Clear Palace slandered them without reason, they would have to pay a huge spiritual loss fee.</p><p></p><p>After the heart-to-heart, the Seven Emotions Valley really had no suspicion, and then the Upper Clear Palace bled heavily and returned in disgrace.</p><p></p><p>The whole incident became increasingly puzzling.</p><p></p><p>She didn't even know what to do.</p><p></p><p>Could it really be the hand of the Yang Clan? Yang Qiuyang was so fond of Lianyi, why would he do such a thing.</p><p></p><p>Could it be because she had rejected Yang Qiuyang's wish to become Lianyi's cultivation partner several times, and under this, Yang Qiuyang's love turned to hatred, and since he couldn't get her, he wanted to destroy her?</p><p></p><p>It seemed quite possible!</p><p></p><p>Yun Mi's eyes lit up, feeling that the whole incident had suddenly become clear!</p><p></p><p>It seems that I need to go to the Yang Clan...</p><p></p><p>Just then, a startled shout rang out outside the Upper Clear Palace!</p><p></p><p>"Yun Mi, hand over Su Lianyi!!"</p><p></p><p>Immediately, the entire Upper Clear Palace was in an uproar!</p><p></p><p>"What a Yang Qiuyang, it seems that our palace has guessed correctly... Unable to obtain her, also unable to destroy her, now he wants to directly snatch her! Arrogant!"</p><p></p><p>Yun Mi's eyes showed an 'I knew it' expression, and her face immediately turned cold, "All the elders of the Upper Clear Palace gather, the rest continue with their own business!"</p><p></p><p>.........</p><p></p><p>In the main hall of the Upper Clear Palace,</p><p></p><p>Yang Qiuyang and Yun Mi faced off!</p><p></p><p>The elders behind the two sides looked at each other with distaste.</p><p></p><p>"Sect Master Yang, our palace really didn't expect you to be so cruel, unable to obtain her, you want to destroy her, and unable to destroy her, you want to forcibly snatch her?"</p><p></p><p>"This is the territory of our Upper Clear Palace, do you have the ability to snatch Lianyi away?"</p><p></p><p>Yun Mi scolded Yang Qiuyang directly without any hesitation, with a cold face.</p><p></p><p>The elders of the Upper Clear Palace side looked at each other, wow, the information is so huge!</p><p></p><p>According to the words of the Palace Master, the attack on Lianyi recently was actually done by the Yang Clan?</p><p></p><p>While the elders behind Yang Qiuyang had expressionless faces, on the way here, the Sect Master had explained the previous causes and consequences to them very clearly!</p><p></p><p>Yang Qiuyang sneered, "Palace Master Yun, you have a good disciple, as Su Lianyi's teacher for so many years, don't you even know what kind of trash your own disciple is?"</p><p></p><p>"You say that our sect couldn't get her, so we wanted to destroy her, and unable to destroy her, we want to forcibly snatch her? Haha, absurd!"</p><p></p><p>"Our Sect Master admits that he used to be infatuated with Su Lianyi, admits it openly, loving someone openly, there's nothing shameful about it."</p><p></p><p>Here is the full English translation of the Chinese excerpt:</p><p></p><p>"Face!" </p><p></p><p>"But... this vile person wants to put our sect to death!"</p><p></p><p>"Haha, have you all heard of the Jade Maiden Mysterious Body? That's right, Su Lianyi discovered it, but she didn't tell you all. Instead, she wanted to swallow it up herself."</p><p></p><p>Jade Maiden Mysterious Body?!</p><p></p><p>Yun Mian's eyes suddenly flashed!</p><p></p><p>The elders behind her also had their pupils contract.</p><p></p><p>"To obtain the Jade Maiden Mysterious Body, Su Lianyi has offended an elder she shouldn't have offended. Our sect has come today to bind Su Lianyi and bring her before that elder. Yun Sect Master, it's best you don't interfere, otherwise... your Shangqing Palace will be in grave danger!"</p><p></p><p>"Our sect's words are not just sensational talk."</p><p></p><p>Yuan Yang Qiu said indifferently. </p><p></p><p>He actually hoped that Shangqing Palace would remain stubborn, which would be perfect, as he had long had designs on Shangqing Palace...</p><p></p><p>Yun Mian's side had their gazes trembling, unable to digest this for a moment.</p><p></p><p>As the Holy Girl, the obedient and well-behaved child Su Lianyi, how could she have done such a thing?</p><p></p><p>"Yuan Yang Qiu, this is just your one-sided account. Do you have any evidence?"</p><p></p><p>Yun Mian took a light breath and asked in a calm voice.</p><p></p><p>"Evidence? Our sect is the evidence. Just summon Su Lianyi out to confront her directly." Yuan Yang Qiu said calmly, sitting steadily on the Fishing Terrace.</p><p></p><p>After a moment,</p><p></p><p>Su Lianyi came out.</p><p></p><p>Yuan Yang Qiu looked at the girl he had once admired, and besides the hatred in his heart, there was also a touch of complexity.</p><p></p><p>How could a person hide themselves to such an extent?</p><p></p><p>"Lianyi..." Yun Mian looked at Su Lianyi, her gaze flickering, and then quickly told her what Yuan Yang Qiu had just said.</p><p></p><p>"Master, Lianyi never knew about any Jade Maiden Mysterious Body. Are you really willing to believe Yuan Sect Master's one-sided words and not trust Lianyi?"</p><p></p><p>Su Lianyi was first confused, then her face was filled with anguish.</p><p></p><p>Yun Mian paused.</p><p></p><p>At this moment, an elder's expression changed, and he looked at Su Lianyi with a complex gaze, then seemed to transmit something to Yun Mian.</p><p></p><p>Yun Mian trembled inwardly, looked deeply at Su Lianyi, and said, "Let those few disciples come in."</p><p></p><p>Yuan Yang Qiu didn't understand, and didn't say anything either, as he wasn't in a hurry. He had this move in the bag, and just watched the still-disguising Su Lianyi, his heart becoming increasingly displeased.</p><p></p><p>Soon, a few disciples carefully entered the main hall.</p><p></p><p>From their attire, they were actually disciples of the Seven Emotions Valley!</p><p></p><p>Su Lianyi's gaze was bewildered, but for some reason, her heart tightened.</p><p></p><p>"We pay our respects to the Sect Master and the Sect Master of the Yuan Sect." The few disciples bowed.</p><p></p><p>Yun Mian didn't beat around the bush and said, "So you are disciples of the Seven Emotions Valley, where is that item you spoke of?"</p><p></p><p>Hearing this, one of the disciples looked up and handed over a token, respectfully saying, "We few people found a disciple token of the Shangqing Palace on the outside some time ago, with the name Xu Jiao engraved on it. We've come to return it."</p><p></p><p>In fact, they didn't dare to come to the Shangqing Palace either. This matter had nothing to do with them.</p><p></p><p>But after they returned to the valley and handed the disciple token to the elder, the valley master later personally brought the disciples and the token to the Shangqing Palace to return it.</p><p></p><p>Of course, they dared not refuse, and quickly agreed.</p><p></p><p>They only knew that the valley master seemed to have a cold smile on his face at the time.</p><p></p><p>Su Lianyi's face suddenly turned deathly pale!</p><p></p><p>Everyone looked at each other in bewilderment.</p><p></p><p>Connecting the various events, Yun Mian's heart inexplicably ached. She took the disciple token and looked at the name on it, then took a light breath and slightly raised her head, closing her eyes as she asked, "How did my Shangqing Palace's Xu Jiao die?"</p><p></p><p>The disciple looked at Su Lianyi and respectfully said, "Disciple Sister Xu Jiao... should have self-destructed..."</p><p></p><p>Yun Mian further asked, "Who was present at the time?"</p><p></p><p>The disciple's voice suddenly trembled a little, "Holy Girl Lianyi..."</p><p></p><p>Su Lianyi suddenly staggered.</p><p></p><p>Yuan Yang Qiu was slightly surprised, then coldly laughed inwardly, "People do the deed, Heaven watches!"</p>

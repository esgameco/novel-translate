        <h1>Chapter 346</h1>
        <div class="content">
            <p>Here is the full English translation of the Chinese excerpt:</p><p></p><p>Han Jinlong carefully sensed the aura of Lu Changsheng, and found that it was indeed a human. üéàüíõÔºñ‚ùæÔº≥ùì±·ëåùìß.ƒÜùï†Œúüíúüî•</p><p></p><p>He finally felt relieved.</p><p></p><p>As long as it was not an alien race invading their human race, it was just strange that he had never seen this person before...</p><p></p><p>"Hehe, fellow Daoist, Han would like to get to know you. Just now I sat down without your permission, that was impolite. How about this, let me treat you to a round of drinks!" Han Jinlong said with a smile.</p><p></p><p>At the same time, Han Jinlong sighed inwardly, it's a good thing that he came this time...</p><p></p><p>If it had been the cold and ruthless Yan Jueyi, this Taoist monk in blue might have been beaten to a pulp by him.</p><p></p><p>He, Han Jinlong, was different. Although he was one of the five human race overlords like Yan Jueyi, his personality was much better than that guy.</p><p></p><p>He, the Golden Wheel King, was known for his courtesy and kindness.</p><p></p><p>Moreover, in this situation, the ignorant are not guilty.</p><p></p><p>"Alright then." Lu Changsheng nodded slightly.</p><p></p><p>"Hehe." Han Jinlong nodded in satisfaction, and then shouted, "Bring a few more pots of wine and bowls!"</p><p></p><p>"Yes, sir, coming right up!" </p><p></p><p>Soon, a waiter brought a few pots of wine and bowls, placed them on the table, and said "Please enjoy" before leaving.</p><p></p><p>Zhou Dafu hurriedly stood up, picked up the wine pot and poured wine for Lu Changsheng and Han Jinlong. His hands were trembling.</p><p></p><p>Although he didn't know the background of the young man in the black robe, he had met the Taoist master in blue before, and he was a formidable person, even the senior Jiang Zhen respected him greatly.</p><p></p><p>After pouring the wine, Zhou Dafu quietly sat back down, not daring to speak.</p><p></p><p>"Pour some for yourself too, what, are you not fond of the wine?" </p><p></p><p>Lu Changsheng saw that Zhou Dafu only poured for him and Han Jinlong, and couldn't help but say.</p><p></p><p>"Ah, yes senior!" Zhou Dafu quickly poured a cup for himself, trembling as he raised the cup to salute Lu Changsheng, then took a small sip and put it down.</p><p></p><p>It's understandable, he was just a small character. Among the billions of cultivators in the human race, there were only over a hundred Mystic Immortal Realm experts, and now one of them was right in front of him. How could he not be nervous? Anyone would be the same.</p><p></p><p>Han Jinlong didn't rush to drink the wine, but looked at Lu Changsheng and asked, "Fellow Daoist, may I ask your surname?"</p><p></p><p>"Lu." Lu Changsheng replied indifferently.</p><p></p><p>Han Jinlong's gaze was strange, and he smiled inexplicably, "I've never heard of such a powerful expert from the human race as Fellow Daoist Lu..."</p><p></p><p>Lu Changsheng looked up, "There are many things you haven't heard of."</p><p></p><p>Han Jinlong paused, feeling a bit depressed in his heart. As the Golden Wheel King, he was blocked at every turn today.</p><p></p><p>That female cultivator was like that, the skinny guy was also like that, and even this little friend Lu was like that.</p><p></p><p>This day, there's no way to get through it.</p><p></p><p>Before Han Jinlong could speak, Lu Changsheng continued, "It's you, your background doesn't seem simple, does it?"</p><p></p><p>Han Jinlong's pupils shrank slightly, what's the situation, where did he reveal a crack? He then kept his expression unchanged: "What makes Fellow Daoist Lu think so?"</p><p></p><p>Lu Changsheng picked up the wine cup and took a sip, then put the cup down, "Since you know what happened on the square the other day, how dare you sit so calmly in front of me? You don't even call the senior?"</p><p></p><p>He then looked at the head-bowed Zhou Dafu like a child who had done something wrong, "Look, his reaction is very genuine."</p><p></p><p>Han Jinlong: "......"</p><p></p><p>At this moment, Han Jinlong felt like a fool.</p><p></p><p>Next to him, Zhou Dafu suddenly realized, ah, that's right!</p><p></p><p>Here is the full English translation of the Chinese excerpt:</p><p></p><p>This young man in the black robe clearly knew about the strength of Senior Qingyi, yet they could still chat and laugh together...</p><p></p><p>That means this young man in the black robe must be at least at the Divine Profound realm or above in strength?</p><p></p><p>Although experts at the Divine Profound realm and above are generally well-known, some of them are still quite mysterious, so it's normal for this insignificant person to have never seen them before.</p><p></p><p>At this point, Han Jinlong chuckled awkwardly, took a sip of wine, and said, "Fellow Daoist, with such strength, yet you remain unknown. Why don't you go challenge the battle rankings of our Human City?"</p><p></p><p>Lu Changsheng slowly raised his head and smiled mysteriously:</p><p></p><p>"I'm not very interested in rankings. Are you interested?"</p><p></p><p>Huh?</p><p></p><p>Han Jinlong was taken aback. He couldn't care less about rankings - he was one of the Five Clan Leaders of the Human Race, what interest did he have in such child's play.</p><p></p><p>His goal was the individual combat power ranking of the entire Divine-Demonic Battlefield!</p><p></p><p>The day he could climb onto that glorious individual combat power ranking, he would have no regrets in life, even if it was the last place...</p><p></p><p>"I... my strength is still lacking, so getting onto that battle ranking isn't that easy." Han Jinlong said evasively.</p><p></p><p>Lu Changsheng looked steadily at the present Han Jinlong, inwardly amused.</p><p></p><p>This Golden Wheel King, being one of the Five Clan Leaders of the Human Race, had a rather unique personality, quite different from the barbaric kings and wind-like venerable ones he had encountered before.</p><p></p><p>Presumably, this Golden Wheel King usually maintained a certain majesty, but with his mask on, thinking no one would know, he revealed his true nature.</p><p></p><p>As for that Jian Wuhui, he indeed had the bearing of a sword cultivator, not far off from his title of Annihilation Sword Venerable.</p><p></p><p>"Master, you're drinking alone and not calling me, how dreary." </p><p></p><p>At this moment, a miniature dark green turtle appeared on the table.</p><p></p><p>Huh?</p><p></p><p>Han Jinlong and Zhou Dafu's gazes immediately focused on the turtle.</p><p></p><p>"Pardon the intrusion, this is my mount." Lu Changsheng chuckled lightly.</p><p></p><p>Mount?</p><p></p><p>Han Jinlong looked the old turtle over carefully, and his heart was filled with surprise again - this mount also seemed to have some strength...</p><p></p><p>Inevitably, he became even more puzzled about Lu Changsheng's identity.</p><p></p><p>However, he was delighted in his heart - this trip today was not in vain, for the more experts there were for the Human Race, the better.</p><p></p><p>The old turtle also looked at the two people. His gaze only briefly swept over Zhou Dafu, finally settling on Han Jinlong.</p><p></p><p>His heart gradually grew solemn. A strong one!</p><p></p><p>This was the strongest he had seen so far on this Divine-Demonic Battlefield... no, the second strongest.</p><p></p><p>That Dragon Clan's Ao Xing he had encountered that day seemed even stronger.</p><p></p><p>The old turtle quickly averted his gaze, and couldn't help but transmit a message: </p><p></p><p>"Master, who is this person? He's very strong, the old turtle may not be able to beat him."</p><p></p><p>Lu Changsheng glanced at the old turtle without answering him.</p><p></p><p>After a moment of silence, Han Jinlong smiled and said, "Fellow Daoist Lu, what do you think of the Human City compared to the Heaven City and Earth City?"</p><p></p><p>If he could recruit this little friend Lu into the Human City, that would be great.</p><p></p><p>Although in times of war, the Human Race was united against outsiders, but in peacetime, there was competition between the three cities of Heaven, Earth, and Human.</p><p></p><p>After all, only through competition and contention could they become stronger.</p><p></p><p>"What do you mean by that?" Lu Changsheng said with a half-smile.</p><p></p><p>"Haha, nothing in particular, just asking." Han Jinlong chuckled awkwardly.</p><p></p><p>"The Human City is not bad, but I haven't been to the Heaven City and Earth City yet, so I can't really compare." Lu Changsheng said matter-of-factly.</p><p></p><p>What? He hasn't been to the Heaven City and Earth City?</p><p></p><p>Not only Han Jinlong, but even Zhou Dafu was taken aback.</p>

        <h1>Chapter 400</h1>
        <div class="content">
            <p>Here is the full English translation of the Chinese excerpt:</p><p></p><p>"Huff... huff..."</p><p></p><p>Jiang Wuxin, Man Tian, Han Jinlong, Yan Jueyi, and Fang Yun all had their fists clenched tightly, their eyes glowing red!</p><p></p><p>They seemed to have imagined the pitiful state Sword Sovereign was in at the moment!</p><p></p><p>That Divine Thunder possessed the strength to slay a peak Clan Chief in a single strike, so naturally it also possessed the power to kill Jian Wuhuai in one blow!</p><p></p><p>And from the current situation with Hong Yun, it seems that the Divine Thunder was not directly giving Sword Sovereign a quick death, but rather toying with and tormenting him.</p><p></p><p>"No! I can't hold back any longer! I can't abandon Sword Sovereign and run away!!"</p><p></p><p>Han Jinlong roared furiously, rushing back towards the Divine Clan!</p><p></p><p>"Golden Wheel King!" Yan Jueyi's expression changed.</p><p></p><p>"Windwalking Venerable, we must go back, we must go with Sword Sovereign, share his life and death!!"</p><p></p><p>At this time, the Mysterious Immortals spoke urgently, their gazes resolute.</p><p></p><p>Jiang Wuxin's chest heaved violently, and then he gritted his teeth and said, "Then let's go!! We'll... be selfish this once!"</p><p></p><p>With that, the group quickly rushed back towards the Divine Clan!!</p><p></p><p>The old turtle looked at the gloomy sky, sighing, "Master, the situation has changed..."</p><p></p><p>After saying that, he shook his head and also headed towards the Divine Clan, for although he was not of the human race, he had also developed some friendship with Jian Wuhuai and the others, and he couldn't just leave them.</p><p></p><p>...</p><p></p><p>Inside the Divine Clan.</p><p></p><p>Boom!!</p><p></p><p>Jian Wuhuai lay on the ground, covered in wounds, drenched in blood!</p><p></p><p>Only his eyes remained bright and unyielding, not a hint of surrender!</p><p></p><p>"How great a grudge must the Divine Lord have against the human race, to torture Jian Wuhuai like this..."</p><p></p><p>"Ah, look at Jian Wuhuai's gaze, even in such a state, it is still so spirited, truly worthy of the name Sword Sovereign, the essence of the Sword Cultivators!"</p><p></p><p>"Yes, to be honest, I greatly admire him."</p><p></p><p>"In comparison, the Divine Lord's bearing is inferior, relying on his divine realm cultivation."</p><p></p><p>"Are you crazy, daring to speak ill of the Divine Lord!"</p><p></p><p>"..."</p><p></p><p>Just as the cultivators from all tribes were discussing animatedly,</p><p></p><p>The Divine Thunder looked at the fallen Jian Wuhuai and sneered, "How does it feel? You're quite resilient, aren't you?"</p><p></p><p>Jian Wuhuai remained silent.</p><p></p><p>"Hehe, you really think your human race can escape? I've already used my Profound Spirit power to seal off the Divine-Demon Battlefield, they can't run away." The Divine Thunder continued.</p><p></p><p>Jian Wuhuai's expression finally changed slightly, and after a moment, he stared at the Divine Thunder and asked with difficulty, "This Sovereign... wants to ask, why did you not destroy me like you did the Clan Chief of the Heavenly Crow Tribe? Why this humiliation, unbecoming of a Divine Lord's bearing."</p><p></p><p>In Jian Wuhuai's view, this matter must have a reason, if it were only because of the deceased Third Divine Official and the bound Divine Luo, it would not have come to this!</p><p></p><p>After all, the Divine Thunder was vain, so how could he do such a thing for no reason.</p><p></p><p>The Divine Thunder's eyes narrowed, he naturally wouldn't say the reason in front of all the cultivators, and then he said indifferently, "Forget it, just go die."</p><p></p><p>After saying that, the Divine Thunder's brow furrowed in surprise, "Hehe, your human race is quite united..."</p><p></p><p>The originally resigned Jian Wuhuai was startled...</p><p></p><p>The cultivators of all tribes also felt somewhat surprised, but soon they all sensed the sudden change in their expressions!</p><p></p><p>Jiang Wuxin and the others had returned?</p><p></p><p>"Sword Sovereign!!"</p><p></p><p>At this time, the first to rush back, Han Jinlong, saw Jian Wuhuai's pitiful state, and his heart was filled with towering rage!</p><p></p><p>"Jin... Jinlong King."</p><p></p><p>Jian Wuhuai looked at Han Jinlong with difficulty, but the next moment his expression changed drastically!</p><p></p><p>Jian Wuhuai saw Han Jinlong summon the Blazing Sun Heavenly Wheel, rushing madly towards the Divine Thunder!</p><p></p><p>"Jinlong King, don't!!"</p><p></p><p>Han Jinlong ignored him, his mind already filled with rage, he held the Blazing Sun Heavenly Wheel in both hands, recklessly charging forward!</p><p></p><p>"Divine Thunder!! I'll fight you to the death!"</p><p></p><p>"Hehe hehe." The Divine Thunder's face was filled with a cold smile, looking at Han Jinlong as if he were an ant!</p><p></p><p>Just at this moment!</p><p></p><p>Jiang Wuxin and the others had also arrived, they had just arrived and hadn't even had a chance to look at Jian Wuhuai when they saw this terrifying scene!!</p><p></p><p>"Jinlong King!!"</p><p></p><p>Yan Jueyi stared blankly at this scene, his face already deathly pale, his entire body trembling uncontrollably!!!</p><p></p><p>He remembered that day in the City Lord's Palace, when he had drunk that Dream-Inducing Brew!</p><p></p><p>That dream!</p><p></p><p>At the time, he couldn't see who the other person was, nor could he see the surrounding environment, he had just thought it was just a dream, but...!</p><p></p><p>Now, right before his eyes,</p><p></p><p>Here is the full English translation of the Chinese excerpt:</p><p></p><p>It is happening right now!</p><p></p><p>At this moment, the furious Jinlun King is strikingly similar to the Jinlun King in the dream!</p><p></p><p>In the next instant, before Han Jinlong could react, he was easily grasped in the hands of the Divine Thunder, as effortless as holding a chicken.</p><p></p><p>"What a waste dog, daring to charge and rush at the Divine Lord!"</p><p></p><p>The Divine Thunder sneered coldly, then violently slammed Han Jinlong to the ground!</p><p></p><p>Boom!!! The entire Divine Tribe Realm was shaking!</p><p></p><p>Crack, crack...</p><p></p><p>In the blink of an eye, Han Jinlong's entire body was crushed to pieces, leaving only his skull!</p><p></p><p>This was done intentionally by the Divine Thunder!</p><p></p><p>"Jinlun King!!"</p><p></p><p>Seeing the lifeless Han Jinlong, Jiang Wuxin and the others completely lost their minds and rushed towards the Divine Thunder!</p><p></p><p>Even Jian Wuhui, with his last bit of strength, slowly got up from the ground, summoned his long sword, and charged forward gritting his teeth!</p><p></p><p>"Hahaha!! Human race, pathetic ants!! Don't worry, after this ant, you will all die sooner or later, not a single one will survive!"</p><p></p><p>The Divine Thunder laughed maniacally, feeling refreshed in his heart, then stepped on the drowsy Han Jinlong's head and said coldly:</p><p></p><p>"I want all of you to watch him die!! Watch how his head explodes!"</p><p></p><p>With that, he decisively stepped down!!</p><p></p><p>"Bang!"</p><p></p><p>Han Jinlong's head instantly exploded, and he was completely killed!</p><p></p><p>The human race's expressions paused noticeably, their Adam's apples rolling uncontrollably!</p><p></p><p>"Jinlun King!!!"</p><p></p><p>Yan Jueyi, seeing this scene, had blood flowing endlessly from his eyes! </p><p></p><p>He couldn't help but recall the carefree moments he had shared with Han Jinlong by the lake, and he completely went insane!</p><p></p><p>Yan Jueyi's Xuanyin Shaking Heaven Stick rapidly grew in size until it was almost as tall as the sky!</p><p></p><p>He swung the Xuanyin Shaking Heaven Stick fiercely towards the Divine Thunder, shouting, "Bastard, die for me!!"</p><p></p><p>At the same time, the human race cultivators also desperately unleashed their ultimate techniques, wanting to fight the Divine Thunder to the death!!</p><p></p><p>The sky and earth changed color, the mountains and rivers trembled!</p><p></p><p>The cultivators of all tribes had long been stunned and retreated far away, watching this crazy scene dumbfoundedly.</p><p></p><p>The Divine Thunder sneered contemptuously, then gathered divine energy in his palm and slapped out: "You disgusting ants, still don't understand the gap between you and the Divine Lord?!"</p><p></p><p>Boom!!</p><p></p><p>With one palm strike, the Divine Thunder instantly shattered Yan Jueyi's Xuanyin Shaking Heaven Stick.</p><p></p><p>The human race cultivators, including the old turtle, all fell from the sky under this palm strike, losing their combat power!</p><p></p><p>They crashed to the ground, their bones already shattered, the immense pain keeping them painfully conscious!!</p><p></p><p>The Divine Tribe Plaza fell silent, the cultivators of all tribes shivering in fear, after the Tianjia Tribe, the human race was next to be destroyed.</p><p></p><p>The Divine Thunder stood high above, supreme and unrivaled. He flashed and appeared in front of the fallen human race cultivators.</p><p></p><p>The Divine Thunder looked at the completely paralyzed but still conscious Jian Wuhui and the others, sneering, "The Divine Lord will not let you die easily, the Divine Lord will make you human race elites suffer endless torment until you die!!"</p><p></p><p>The cultivators of all tribes felt a chill in their hearts, unable to understand why the Divine Lord had such a strong resentment towards the human race...</p><p></p><p>"You... this beast! You will definitely meet a bad end..."</p><p></p><p>Yan Jueyi tilted his head and with difficulty picked up a stone with his mouth, spitting it towards the Divine Thunder!</p><p></p><p>The stone lightly hit the Divine Thunder's body, although it didn't hurt at all, it made him feel insulted, his face turning black.</p><p></p><p>He flashed and appeared in front of Yan Jueyi, likewise stepping on Yan Jueyi's head!</p><p></p><p>Jian Wuhui and the others' eyeballs were frantically trembling, but they were powerless!</p><p></p><p>At this point, they only had one absurd thought.</p><p></p><p>Lord Lu, if you cultivate to success in the future, you must avenge them...</p><p></p><p>This Divine Thunder must die!</p><p></p><p>"Do you also want your head crushed like that waste dog?" The Divine Thunder looked down at Yan Jueyi coldly, wanting to make him submit.</p><p></p><p>"Try touching him again." A cold voice suddenly rang out from nowhere!</p>

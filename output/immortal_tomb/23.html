        <h1>Chapter 23</h1>
        <div class="content">
            <p>Here is the full English translation of the Chinese excerpt:</p><p></p><p>In the rear courtyard of the Lord's Manor. üéÅ‚òü‚ùª‚ùæsùïôœÖùïè.‚í∏‡πèùêå‚ôüüòæ</p><p></p><p>Compared to the bustling outside, this place is relatively quiet.</p><p></p><p>The howling wind, the sound seems to be blocked a lot.</p><p></p><p>Lu Changsheng closed his eyes and sat cross-legged, his expression calm.</p><p></p><p>.........</p><p></p><p>After Gu Helin finished the hand seals, the middle fingers of his two hands crossed in front of his chest, and he softly chanted in his heart, "Thousand Sword Technique."</p><p></p><p>In the next moment, a thousand gleaming swords formed around his body, gradually rotating with blades covering the sky!</p><p></p><p>This scene of the thousand swords surrounding him was extremely shocking to the commoners below!</p><p></p><p>"This is an intermediate-level spiritual technique, the Thousand Sword Technique! A full thousand luminous swords, the Master has perfected this technique!"</p><p></p><p>Tongxin watched the scene in the sky, his eyes filled with awe.</p><p></p><p>In the cultivation world, techniques are graded from low to high as Mysterious, Spiritual, Kun, and Qian. Each grade is further divided into elementary, intermediate, and advanced levels.</p><p></p><p>An intermediate-level spiritual technique actually reaching perfection!</p><p></p><p>Tongxin had also cultivated this technique, but could only condense a few dozen swords at most...</p><p></p><p>It's clear how astonished he was!</p><p></p><p>At the same time,</p><p></p><p>Gu Helin pointed a finger and said, "Go!"</p><p></p><p>The rotating swords paused for a moment, then suddenly shot out, rushing towards the Black Tongue Demon Clan Leader and his companions, like a torrent of ice!</p><p></p><p>The temperature in this space seemed to drop slightly.</p><p></p><p>Swoosh swoosh swoosh...</p><p></p><p>The sound of the swords piercing the air was incessant, their sharpness chilling the heart!</p><p></p><p>The Black Tongue Demon Clan Leader's eyes narrowed as he watched this, a hint of horror in his heart, but he sneered coldly,</p><p></p><p>"Gu Helin, as the Clan Leader, I admit that I can't defeat you in a one-on-one fight tonight, but it's a pity... " Towards the end, the Black Tongue Demon Clan Leader suddenly roared, "Break his thousand swords!"</p><p></p><p>"Yes!" The four Black Tongue Demons beside him, who were clearly of high status in the clan, immediately obeyed the order.</p><p></p><p>The Black Tongue Demon Clan Leader pulled out a pitch-black long spear in his hand and proudly said, "You cultivators have spiritual tools and treasures, and we in the Demon Realm naturally have demonic treasures as well! Have you heard of the Abyss Demon Spear?"</p><p></p><p>After saying this, he fiercely raised the Abyss Demon Spear and shouted, "Quickly infuse your demonic energy into it!"</p><p></p><p>The four Black Tongue Demons heard the order and slapped the black spear with their palms, pouring their abundant demonic energy into it, soon becoming breathless!</p><p></p><p>They knew that relying on the Clan Leader alone would not be enough to activate this demonic treasure.</p><p></p><p>"Haha! Wonderful! Gu Helin, the Abyss Demon Spear has drunk the blood of the sea, and with its power, I'd like to see what you can use to block it!" </p><p></p><p>The Black Tongue Demon Clan Leader, feeling the trembling of the Abyss Demon Spear in his hand, laughed triumphantly. The next moment, he fiercely threw it out, turning into a black beam of light!</p><p></p><p>"Abyss Demon Spear, go!"</p><p></p><p>Boom boom boom!!</p><p></p><p>The moment the Abyss Demon Spear shot out, the sky suddenly rumbled with muffled thunder, and flashes of lightning flickered between the clouds!</p><p></p><p>It was as if this evil demonic treasure had displeased the Heavenly Dao of the Spiritual Realm!</p><p></p><p>"The Abyss Demon Spear..."</p><p></p><p>Even before the Black Tongue Demon Clan Leader pulled it out, Gu Helin had already been stunned!</p><p></p><p>How could this Black Tongue Demon Clan Leader have the Abyss Demon Spear, a demonic treasure belonging to the Abyss Demon King, Zhao Shenyuan?</p><p></p><p>Damn it!</p><p></p><p>In an instant, Gu Helin realized that the Abyss Demon Spear was lent by Zhao Shenyuan to the Black Tongue Demon Clan Leader to wield!</p><p></p><p>Woo woo woo‚Äî</p><p></p><p>Vast demonic energy emanated from the Abyss Demon Spear, permeating the surrounding space, and the commoners below directly felt a chill running through their bones under the influence of this demonic aura!</p><p></p><p>At this moment, the thousand luminous swords in the sky were about to collide with the Abyss Demon Spear!</p><p></p><p>At the moment of collision, the black beam of light that the Abyss Demon Spear had transformed into suddenly morphed into the illusory figure of a gigantic evil tiger dozens of zhang long, its jaws wide open to reveal the abyss within!</p><p></p><p>"Roar!"</p><p></p><p>Here is the full English translation of the Chinese excerpt:</p><p></p><p>A sinister tiger's roar suddenly exploded in the night sky!!!</p><p></p><p>The countless commoners below turned deathly pale, their minds going blank for a moment as they instinctively covered their ears, but to no avail as streams of fresh blood still trickled down from their ears.</p><p></p><p>However, they were not even aware of this, simply staring blankly at the sky, a sense of terror welling up from within!</p><p></p><p>Those thousands of mystical light swords had all been scattered by this tiger's roar!!</p><p></p><p>"Poof!!"</p><p></p><p>Ancient Crane Forest was struck by backlash, violently coughing up a mouthful of blood as he clutched his chest, his eyes filled with horror as the abyss demon's long spear continued to swoop down towards him!!</p><p></p><p>This was a demonic treasure!</p><p></p><p>Although the Black Tongue Demon Tribe Chief and the others were unable to unleash its full power, at this moment Ancient Crane Forest had even suffered backlash, so what could he use to block it?</p><p></p><p>Even if his techniques could stop this long spear, he would be grievously injured!</p><p></p><p>And after he was grievously injured, what would happen to the commoners here?</p><p></p><p>Perhaps it would be better to...</p><p></p><p>"Master!!!" </p><p></p><p>On the city wall,Á´•ÂøÉ's eyes turned scarlet red as he was about to fly up on his sword.</p><p></p><p>"Stay where you are and don't move!!" Ancient Crane Forest shouted sternly.</p><p></p><p>"M-Master..."Á´•ÂøÉ's body stiffened as he saw Ancient Crane Forest's somewhat weakened figure, tears sliding down the corners of his eyes.</p><p></p><p>Since entering the immortal cultivation world, Ancient Crane Forest's bearing had always been upright, and the name of Ancient Immortal had resounded far and wide in the Eastern Domain!</p><p></p><p>He had never seen Ancient Crane Forest in such a weak state, now looking like a decrepit old man.</p><p></p><p>"Hahaha, how touching, the master-disciple bond, Ancient Crane Forest, my Ancient Immortal, rest assured, after you die, your disciple will soon come keep you company... this abyss demon's long spear will slaughter everyone here..."</p><p></p><p>The Black Tongue Demon Tribe Chief licked the corner of his mouth and sneered.</p><p></p><p>"Hehe, the Tribe Chief's words are absolutely right." The four slightly weakened Black Tongue Demons quickly echoed with sinister laughter.</p><p></p><p>Anyone with eyes could see that the demons had gained the absolute upper hand!</p><p></p><p>King Lishui and the others, as well as the commoners, were completely panicked!</p><p></p><p>Even this powerful immortal could not defeat these demons, so for all the people present here today, would they really meet their end at the hands of these demons?</p><p></p><p>"Hahaha haha haha!"</p><p></p><p>Suddenly, Ancient Crane Forest straightened his body and threw his head back in a heroic laughter!</p><p></p><p>This scene attracted the attention of all the demons as well as everyone else.</p><p></p><p>The Black Tongue Demon Tribe Chief's expression changed slightly, his gaze becoming uncertain. Could it be that Ancient Crane Forest still had some trick up his sleeve?</p><p></p><p>But he had already suffered such severe backlash!</p><p></p><p>"I studied from the age of three, practiced martial arts from six, and entered the immortal cultivation world at ten. After over three hundred years of arduous cultivation, I sought longevity, but even more so, I sought the unyielding spirit in my heart!"</p><p></p><p>"Slaying demons and protecting the commoners, what is death to me?"</p><p></p><p>Ancient Crane Forest's complexion was ashen, but his tone was as unyielding as iron!</p><p></p><p>King Lishui and the commoners were somewhat awestruck, for a moment no longer fearing.</p><p></p><p>"M-Master..."Á´•ÂøÉ's spirit trembled, hearing those resounding words, as if he had suddenly grown up a lot, even his cultivation realm beginning to fluctuate!</p><p></p><p>The next moment,</p><p></p><p>the abyss demon's long spear swooped in!</p><p></p><p>Ancient Crane Forest's expression became ferocious as he mobilized his entire cultivation, his entire being shining with radiance, roaring, "I, Ancient, will burn through my cultivation to send you demons to hell, you will not dare to harm a single person here!!!"</p><p></p><p>Á´•ÂøÉcould no longer hold back, flying up on his sword, wailing, "Master, don't!"</p><p></p><p>If Ancient Crane Forest burned through his cultivation, as a cultivator without spiritual power, he would directly perish!</p><p></p><p>In this critical moment, </p><p></p><p>amidst the dumbfounded gazes of many, a young man in blue gradually materialized in front of Ancient Crane Forest, tapping his forehead with a finger while mysteriously saying,</p><p></p><p>"Shut up."</p>

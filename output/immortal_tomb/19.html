        <h1>Chapter 19</h1>
        <div class="content">
            <p>Here is the full English translation of the Chinese excerpt:</p><p></p><p>The night fell. üíúüò≤ÔºñÔºô≈ú—íùêî‰πÇ.ÔΩÉ·µíÁà™üçßüòé</p><p></p><p>In the forest, Elder Guchelin and Tongxin were sitting cross-legged on the tree trunk, with the sounds of insects chirping all around them.</p><p></p><p>Through the branches and leaves, Tongxin could see many flickering lights in the distance, with countless figures bustling about.</p><p></p><p>By this time, the army's encampment with the civilians was also nearing its end.</p><p></p><p>"Master, the King of Lishui is quite clever, knowing that the senior is here, so he has brought the civilians to this Moyu Town," Tongxin chuckled lightly.</p><p></p><p>Guchelin opened his eyes and sighed, "I investigated during the day, and it's not as you said. The officials of Lishui all believe that Moyu Town is blessed by a Immortal Tomb."</p><p></p><p>Tongxin was surprised, "Does that mean they don't know about the existence of that senior?"</p><p></p><p>Guchelin suddenly didn't want to speak anymore, as he found that this disciple always liked to talk nonsense.</p><p></p><p>"Tongxin, can you stop talking nonsense? I've already made it clear, why do you have to repeat it again?" Guchelin said helplessly.</p><p></p><p>Tongxin was stunned for a moment, then responded apologetically, "Master, I'll pay attention next time."</p><p></p><p>"Hmph." Guchelin snorted coldly, then continued solemnly, "Yes, they indeed don't know about the existence of that senior. But I suspect the Town Master of Moyu Town definitely knows."</p><p></p><p>He then continued, "However, that Town Master probably won't tell the King of Lishui, as that senior seems to be a rather reclusive person."</p><p></p><p>"Master, you're right, that senior does seem quite reclusive, as if he doesn't fit in with this world at all..." Tongxin's words were cut short by Guchelin's glare.</p><p></p><p>"Look at you, repeating again!!"</p><p></p><p>Tongxin flinched, quickly changing the topic, "Master, what realm is that senior at?"</p><p></p><p>Sure enough, this question made Guchelin furrow his brows, his attention immediately drawn in.</p><p></p><p>"I don't dare to casually speculate about that senior's realm..." Guchelin narrowed his eyes, recalling the scene of that senior falling from the sky earlier that day.</p><p></p><p>At that moment, the incomparable, towering power was something he had never experienced before! It was simply irresistible!</p><p></p><p>He then continued in front of Tongxin's expectant gaze, "Although I haven't broken through to the Nascent Soul realm yet, I've fought with many Nascent Soul Patriarchs... That senior's strength is very likely beyond the Nascent Soul realm..."</p><p></p><p>Tongxin suddenly stood up from the tree trunk, exclaiming in shock, "Divinity Venerable!"</p><p></p><p>Guchelin frowned, "Sit down, don't get so agitated. I'm just speculating."</p><p></p><p>Tongxin sat back down, his face filled with disbelief.</p><p></p><p>Could it be that the one standing before them earlier that day was truly the legendary Divinity Venerable?</p><p></p><p>He had just reached the Foundation Establishment realm, when would he be able to become a Divinity Venerable? Would he ever have that chance in his lifetime?</p><p></p><p>After the shock, Tongxin fell into deep self-doubt.</p><p></p><p>Guchelin saw the expression on Tongxin's face and immediately understood what he was thinking. He then spoke in a deep voice, "Tongxin, don't be overly ambitious. The cultivation path is long and arduous. You've just reached the Foundation Establishment realm, and still have the Gold Core and Nascent Soul realms ahead of you. Do you really think you can reach the Divinity realm already?"</p><p></p><p>"Damn it! Even your master hasn't advanced to the Nascent Soul realm yet, and you want to fly?" The last sentence, Guchelin couldn't help but curse.</p><p></p><p>Tongxin snapped back to his senses, lowering his head and trembling, "Master, I know I was wrong."</p><p></p><p>Guchelin's expression softened, closing his eyes and saying indifferently, "I'll deal with you after we return to the sect."</p><p></p><p>Tongxin's face turned bitter.</p><p></p><p>Here is the full English translation of the Chinese excerpt:</p><p></p><p>After a long while, the countless lights in the distance gradually went out, and the busy commoners had finally fallen asleep.</p><p></p><p>In the darkness of the night, only the soldiers were patrolling vigilantly.</p><p></p><p>"Master, your disciple still has a question to ask," Tongxin said cautiously, looking at Guchelin.</p><p></p><p>"Speak," Guchelin said, his eyes closed and his mouth slightly open.</p><p></p><p>"It's just that, when facing that senior earlier today, why did the master tell that senior about the demonic intentions of plotting to invade the immortal tomb?" Tongxin asked curiously.</p><p></p><p>Guchelin opened his eyes, looked towards the direction of Moyu Town, and said solemnly, "The matter of the immortal tomb is difficult to predict. That senior has great divine abilities, and if the problem becomes serious, we may need that senior's help to save the world."</p><p></p><p>Tongxin was stunned and murmured, "Master, is it really that serious?"</p><p></p><p>"I'm just guessing, sigh." Guchelin sighed worriedly and slowly closed his eyes to meditate.</p><p></p><p>He felt an inexplicable sense of urgency, wanting to advance to the Nascent Soul stage as soon as possible to deal with this, as he felt that this incident was not simple at all.</p><p></p><p>But advancing to the Nascent Soul stage was not that easy...</p><p></p><p>Meanwhile, in Jia'yuan City.</p><p></p><p>"Clan... Clan Leader!" </p><p></p><p>A group of Black Tongue Demons knelt on the ground, unable to believe it.</p><p></p><p>The Clan Leader had actually come in person, this this this... They were a bit confused.</p><p></p><p>"You previously reported that a Golden Core cultivator had appeared in the Lishui Empire. Where is that cultivator now?" the Black Tongue Demon Clan Leader asked sternly, sweeping his gaze across the fifteen Black Tongue Demons.</p><p></p><p>He had sent twenty-one, but six had died!</p><p></p><p>"Clan Leader, we speculate that the Golden Core cultivator should have escorted those commoners to Moyu Town," the Black Tongue Demon in the middle respectfully replied.</p><p></p><p>Regarding the relocation of the commoners to Moyu Town, the Black Tongue Demon Clan Leader already knew about it, and his emotions were not too agitated. He then asked, "Do you know who that Golden Core cultivator is?"</p><p></p><p>All the Black Tongue Demons shook their heads. How would they know who that Golden Core cultivator was? They wished they could hide far away, afraid of being discovered.</p><p></p><p>"Clan Leader, we only know that the Golden Core cultivator is most likely from the Qingxuan Sect, since the Lishui Empire is under the protection and governance of the Qingxuan Sect," the Black Tongue Demon in the middle said confidently.</p><p></p><p>"Qingxuan Sect..." the Black Tongue Demon Clan Leader's voice seemed to be gritted out between his teeth, and then he coldly said, "We shall lurk in this city for a few days, and after all our clan members have arrived, we will go to Moyu Town and exterminate everyone there!"</p><p></p><p>"Yes!!" The eyes of the Black Tongue Demons flashed with bloodlust, extremely excited.</p><p></p><p>Blood, endless blood, was what they saw in their minds.</p><p></p><p>"Go now, prevent the situation from escalating further. For now, we won't bother with the southern, northern, and western parts of the Lishui Empire, we'll first occupy the eastern part."</p><p></p><p>The Black Tongue Demon Clan Leader thought of the instructions from the Abyss Demon King, and with a chilling voice, he disappeared into a black mist.</p><p></p><p>...</p><p></p><p>The next day, the morning sun rose.</p><p></p><p>The King of the Lishui Empire, accompanied by Chen Dadao and a group of officials, was chatting about the affairs of the empire while bathing in the morning sun. Somehow, they ended up walking to the back garden.</p><p></p><p>Chen Dadao's heart tightened when he saw the King of the Lishui Empire looking towards the back garden.</p><p></p><p>No, no, no...</p><p></p><p>"Unexpectedly, the scenery in the back garden of your Garrison Headquarters is so beautiful. Haha, let's discuss matters here," the King of the Lishui Empire said with a smile, about to step in, with the officials closely following.</p><p></p><p>But at this moment, Chen Dadao gritted his teeth and suddenly ran in front of the group, bowing and saying:</p><p></p><p>"Your Majesty, this place... cannot be entered."</p>

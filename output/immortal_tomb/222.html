        <h1>Chapter 222</h1>
        <div class="content">
            <p>Here is the full English translation of the Chinese excerpt:</p><p></p><p>The long sword disappeared into the void. </p><p></p><p>The sunset Leilin fell into a deathly silence.</p><p></p><p>The members of the Great Day Thunder Sect had ashen faces. They watched helplessly as their sect master, who had always looked down on everything, was reduced to nothingness, leaving not even a trace behind.</p><p></p><p>As for Lei Yu and Lei Ting, they were like they had lost their souls, their minds in a daze.</p><p></p><p>"This might be the last time I invite you to drink." </p><p></p><p>Lei Yu recalled those strange words, his expression stunned, then at peace.</p><p></p><p>Ah, no wonder, no wonder...</p><p></p><p>...</p><p></p><p>Clang!</p><p></p><p>The ancient long sword pierced through the dark void at an unparalleled speed!</p><p></p><p>The void it passed through shattered layer upon layer!</p><p></p><p>At the same time,</p><p></p><p>In the Linglong Heavens, the celestial domain.</p><p></p><p>Wei Sheng Tian was also fleeing through the void at an extremely fast speed. He would occasionally glance back, his aged face filled with urgency!</p><p></p><p>He had been locked onto by an extremely fierce aura!</p><p></p><p>Wei Sheng Tian knew that it was Long Sheng's sword!</p><p></p><p>The old man's illusory figure in the Sunset Leilin was like his eyes, he saw everything that happened clearly.</p><p></p><p>Damn it, he had never imagined that Long Sheng would suddenly appear in the Linglong Heavens!</p><p></p><p>And in the identity of the never-before-heard-of Carefree Sect Master.</p><p></p><p>He suspected that Long Sheng had used this opportunity of the Grand Competition of the Myriad Sects to hunt them down.</p><p></p><p>A conspiracy, it was all a conspiracy!</p><p></p><p>And there was one more thing that tormented him greatly, and that was that Long Sheng's memories had not been erased before they suppressed him with such a large group of people.</p><p></p><p>Damn it, how did he find the Linglong Heavens!</p><p></p><p>At this moment, Wei Sheng Tian hated those mysterious powerhouses to the core!</p><p></p><p>They had really done him in!</p><p></p><p>Not only did he not gain anything, but he had also provoked the terrifying enemy Long Sheng!</p><p></p><p>Whoosh!!</p><p></p><p>Just as Wei Sheng Tian was filled with regret, a sound of air being sliced accompanied by a terrifying sword qi erupted in the void behind him!!</p><p></p><p>He suddenly shuddered, his face more grave than ever before.</p><p></p><p>"I, the Ninth Heavenly Ancestor, the peak of the Linglong Heavens' number one... Long Sheng..."</p><p></p><p>Saying this, Wei Sheng Tian stared fixedly at the incoming sharp edge, his expression filled with despair and unwillingness. He activated the immortal energy within his body and let out a fierce roar: "Even if you kill me, you will have to pay a price!!!"</p><p></p><p>His roar, accompanied by the eruption of the Ninth Heavenly Ancestor's immortal energy, exploded in the vast void centered on the celestial domain.</p><p></p><p>This ferocious speech caused numerous powerful experts to be greatly shaken, their trembling gazes turning towards the void, but they could see nothing.</p><p></p><p>The peak of the Ninth Heavenly Ancestor, the Patriarch... Who else could it be other than the Holy Spirit Palace's Wei Sheng Tian?</p><p></p><p>And who is this Long Sheng, to have driven Wei Sheng Tian to such a state!</p><p></p><p>...</p><p></p><p>Wei Sheng Tian's hand suddenly produced a long halberd. He placed the halberd diagonally behind him, his eyes fixed intently on the approaching long sword.</p><p></p><p>He had no confidence in being able to defend against Long Sheng's sword.</p><p></p><p>Might as well meet it head-on!</p><p></p><p>Even if he couldn't hurt Long Sheng, he would at least make the sword suffer damage or even break it!</p><p></p><p>He didn't believe that Long Sheng's sword, after traveling such a long distance from the human domain to the celestial domain, would not have consumed any energy.</p><p></p><p>The next moment,</p><p></p><p>Countless mysterious markings suddenly appeared on Wei Sheng Tian's entire body surface, looking extremely sinister.</p><p></p><p>He frantically channeled all the immortal energy in his body into the long halberd,</p><p></p><p>But it was far from enough, so he continued to burn all his remaining life force.</p><p></p><p>Soon, his complexion turned ashen, the death marks on his face making him look like a dead man.</p><p></p><p>Here is my translation of the Chinese excerpt:</p><p></p><p>The darkness deepens!</p><p></p><p>Since I'm doomed to die anyway, I'll expend everything and unleash my mightiest strike!</p><p></p><p>The new 69 book at 99shuxia.com</p><p></p><p>The holy halberd vibrates furiously, as it has never felt this powerful in its entire existence!</p><p></p><p>Feeling all this, Wei Shengian murmurs: "Holy Divine Halberd... you have accompanied this palace for countless years, and for this final time... this palace is betting everything, do not let this palace down..."</p><p></p><p>Hum hum hum!</p><p></p><p>The Holy Divine Halberd continues to vibrate, with its shaft igniting in white flames. Wei Shengian smiles contentedly, then hurls it out with great force!!</p><p></p><p>"Drink!"</p><p></p><p>The halberd then pierces through the air!</p><p></p><p>But at that moment, the incoming ancient longsword unleashes its sword qi, like a towering tsunami. </p><p></p><p>The halberd is instantly shattered into two pieces and falls into the void, letting out a mournful cry.</p><p></p><p>It ended before it even began.</p><p></p><p>Wei Shengian pauses, gazing at the approaching sword. Many memories suddenly flash through his mind.</p><p></p><p>There were still so many things he had yet to do.</p><p></p><p>"Lu Changsheng, this palace is unwilling to accept this..." </p><p></p><p>Wei Shengian's murmur trails off as the longsword swiftly approaches!!</p><p></p><p>.........</p><p></p><p>"Lu Changsheng, this palace is unwilling to accept this..."</p><p></p><p>In the sky above the Sunset Thunder Forest, the faint figure of an elder uttered these words, then slowly dissipated from the bewildered onlookers' sight.</p><p></p><p>Through these words, they vaguely sensed that Patriarch Wei might have met his end.</p><p></p><p>Just then,</p><p></p><p>the void trembles, and the ancient longsword suddenly appears, hovering before Lu Changsheng.</p><p></p><p>Li Tailing finally could no longer bear the torment in his heart. He abruptly turns and tries to flee into the void.</p><p></p><p>Sizzle!!!</p><p></p><p>At this moment, a sword light flashes!</p><p></p><p>Li Tailing's body suddenly freezes!</p><p></p><p>He slowly turns around, looking at the standing Lu Changsheng holding the sword, and bitterly smiles: "Your sword... is so fast."</p><p></p><p>The next moment, Li Tailing's entire body splits in two and vanishes into nothingness.</p><p></p><p>The cultivators stare dumbfoundedly at the instantly slain Skyfire Pavilion Sect Master, a chill rising in their hearts.</p><p></p><p>Henceforth, in this Lingxiu Heavens, who could be a match for the Sect Master of the Carefree Sect...</p><p></p><p>Even the once-mighty Holy Divine Sect could not compare to this formidable power.</p><p></p><p>At this time, the longsword in Lu Changsheng's hand rises again!!</p><p></p><p>The sword tip points towards the Great Day Thunder Sect!</p><p></p><p>The members of the Great Day Thunder Sect are now utterly panicked and terrified, not knowing what to do!!</p><p></p><p>They want to flee but dare not, for they know they cannot escape!!</p><p></p><p>"Senior, please wait a moment," Leiyu raises his head and says with a complex smile.</p><p></p><p>Lu Changsheng holds the sword, his expression calm.</p><p></p><p>"Senior, are you going to annihilate the entire Great Day Thunder Sect?" Leiyu asks with flickering eyes.</p><p></p><p>Lu Changsheng speaks softly: "Not only the Great Day Thunder Sect, but the Holy Divine Sect and Skyfire Pavilion as well."</p><p></p><p>The Sunset Thunder Forest falls silent, save for the dialogue between Lu Changsheng and Leiyu.</p><p></p><p>Hearing this, Leiyu presses his lips together, and a bottle of wine suddenly appears in his hand.</p><p></p><p>Peng instantly startles, for they can see that it is a bottle of Soul-Cleansing Brew!!</p><p></p><p>"Senior, this Soul-Cleansing Brew is truly delicious. May I have the honor of finishing this last bottle?" Leiyu raises the wine bottle and smiles.</p><p></p><p>The Soul-Cleansing Brew he had set aside the other day, he couldn't bear to drink it yet.</p><p></p><p>Beside him, Leiying and the two protective disciples behind him feel a pang in their hearts, their eyes reddening.</p><p></p><p>"Drink," Lu Changsheng says calmly.</p><p></p><p>Hearing this, Leiyu is delighted. He embraces the wine bottle and starts to drink it down in gulps.</p><p></p><p>Glug glug glugâ€”</p><p></p><p>Only the corners of his eyes glisten with tears.</p><p></p><p>"Haha haha, how refreshing!!!" Leiyu suddenly lets out a loud laugh, then violently throws the empty bottle high into the air, solemnly saying,</p><p></p><p>"Senior, grant me death!"</p><p></p><p>Upon hearing this, Lu Changsheng unleashes a sword strike!!</p>

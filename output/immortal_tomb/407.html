        <h1>Chapter 407</h1>
        <div class="content">
            <p>Here is the full English translation of the Chinese excerpt:</p><p></p><p>For tens of millions of years, </p><p></p><p>Lu Changsheng has traversed many worlds, riding on the back of an ancient turtle, witnessing all kinds of people and strange occurrences.</p><p></p><p>Recently, Lu Changsheng also went to the Four Directions Immortal Realm, and casually tossed Ancient Crane Forest and Chen Dadao into the Great Dao Demon-Subduing Tower, joining the Carefree Sect and keeping company with Tong Xin Lin.</p><p></p><p>However, while in the Four Directions Immortal Realm, the Heavenly Dao had come to him, saying that Ancestor Heavenly God Realm's Xing Tian had been looking for him.</p><p></p><p>After some contemplation, Lu Changsheng once again rode the ancient turtle and traveled to the Ancestor Heavenly God Realm.</p><p></p><p>When Xing Tian saw Lu Changsheng, the resolute middle-aged man suddenly broke down in tears, almost smearing them on Lu Changsheng's clothes.</p><p></p><p>Without a word, Lu Changsheng gave Xing Tian a kick, which calmed him down. Xing Tian then hurriedly explained the situation to Lu Changsheng, kneeling and begging for his help. He said he would do anything if Lu Changsheng was willing to help.</p><p></p><p>It turned out that Xing Tian's daughter, He Xitong, had finally completed her tribulation of a myriad lifetimes. This should have been a joyous occasion, but before Xing Tian could rejoice, a mysterious old woman descended upon the Ancestor Heavenly God Realm and forcibly took He Xitong away.</p><p></p><p>Xing Tian knew the old woman was up to no good, as even the Divine Emperors and the eleven Guardians were no match for her. In the end, Xing Tian could only watch helplessly as the old woman took He Xitong away, leaving behind the words "If you have the ability, come find me in the Qiankun Heavens."</p><p></p><p>The Qiankun Heavens... Xing Tian was utterly despairing, having no idea where or what the Qiankun Heavens were, let alone how to find them.</p><p></p><p>At this time, the mysterious and all-capable Lu Changsheng became Xing Tian's last hope. Xing Tian had repeatedly gone to the Four Directions Immortal Realm to inquire about Lu Changsheng, but always to no avail. In the end, he could only beseech the Heavenly Dao to inform him if there was any news of Lu Changsheng.</p><p></p><p>Finally, his perseverance paid off, and he got the news he had been waiting for.</p><p></p><p>After learning of the situation, Lu Changsheng was indeed a bit hesitant, but when he thought of the little fruit-selling girl in the Lingchen Realm and the young lady who had studied medicine at his clinic in Smoke and Rain Town in the Ancestor Heavenly God Realm, he ultimately nodded in agreement.</p><p></p><p>Seeing this, Xing Tian was immensely grateful and his hopeless heart was filled with hope once more! Without further delay, Lu Changsheng, accompanied by Xing Tian's farewells, rode the ancient turtle and departed the Ancestor Heavenly God Realm, embarking on a quest to find the so-called Qiankun Heavens.</p><p></p><p>In the boundless void, searching for such a world was akin to finding a needle in a haystack. But this was no challenge for Lu Changsheng, who, armed with the details gleaned from his conversation with Xing Tian, quickly pinpointed a certain star.</p><p></p><p>This turned out to be a world even greater in scale than the Divine-Demon Battlefield. Considering Xing Tian's description of the old woman, it seemed this world was no simple place.</p><p></p><p>And so, Lu Changsheng calmly rode the ancient turtle towards this world.</p><p></p><p>Since he had promised Xing Tian, he would certainly help, but he was in no rush, for after some calculations, he determined that He Xitong was not in immediate danger.</p><p></p><p>...</p><p></p><p>In the Qiankun Heavens, in the Cloud Mist Ancient Nation, in the City of Heavenly Fragrance, by the shores of the Secluded Pavilion Lake, a young man in azure robes was quietly playing the zither, with an old, hunched figure standing behind him like a loyal guard, his gaze filled with a tinge of bitterness.</p><p></p><p>The soothing, melodious sounds of the zither echoed along the lakeside, drawing a crowd of people who were all entranced, their eyes glazed over as they immersed themselves in the music that seemed to cleanse the soul.</p><p></p><p>Many young ladies had their eyes shining with admiration, gazing longingly at the transcendent young man in azure.</p><p></p><p>"Wow, the Zither Immortal has appeared again! So handsome!!"</p><p></p><p>Here is my translation of the Chinese excerpt:</p><p></p><p>The world has never heard such melodious music, nor seen such an extraordinary man!</p><p></p><p>"I, Afeng, will only marry the Qin Immortal in this life!! Waaah..."</p><p></p><p>"The Qin Immortal is mine! I am the Qin Immortal's one and only!!"</p><p></p><p>"You girls, can you stop shouting? It's finally peaceful enough to listen to the Qin Immortal's playing, can't you let everyone enjoy it properly!!"</p><p></p><p>"Yes! When someone is playing, the basic etiquette is to listen quietly. Don't they even know that?"</p><p></p><p>The love-struck girls, seeing that they had provoked the crowd's anger, could only pout and quiet down, though their affectionate, infatuated gazes remained fixed on the scholar in blue robes gently playing the zither in the distance, unable to look away.</p><p></p><p>Soon, the piece came to an end. </p><p></p><p>The scholar in blue lightly lifted his hands from the strings, closing his eyes and sitting silently for a moment.</p><p></p><p>The crowd by the Youting Lake also remained motionless, standing quietly, with many closing their eyes as if still immersed in the beautiful music.</p><p></p><p>As for the girls, they kept their eyes wide open, staring intently at the scholar, their faces flushed as if they wanted to devour him.</p><p></p><p>The elder behind the scholar grew even more sour, amazed that playing the zither could be so effective at attracting women.</p><p></p><p>The master truly is the master - skilled and proficient in everything. Though the elder could learn quickly, he could never play even a hundredth as well. When he played, it was just playing the zither, but when the master played, he was playing from the heart and soul.</p><p></p><p>However, the elder soon felt a bit better about it - while he may not be able to play the zither, he did have some skills when it came to matters of the heart.</p><p></p><p>At this moment, Lu Changsheng opened his eyes and slowly rose from his seat. </p><p></p><p>The elder snapped back to attention, quickly wrapping the long zither in a black cloth and picking it up, then looking to Lu Changsheng.</p><p></p><p>Lu Changsheng glanced towards the city, then began walking away with his hands behind his back.</p><p></p><p>The elder was taken aback - normally the master would just leave immediately after playing, but today he wanted to stroll through Tianxiang City?</p><p></p><p>He didn't dare think too much about it, and simply followed along at a leisurely pace.</p><p></p><p>The people by the Youting Lake were stunned to see Lu Changsheng approaching them, then erupted into a frenzy!</p><p></p><p>The Qin Immortal was not leaving directly today, but wanted to wander through Tianxiang City?</p><p></p><p>They quickly parted to the sides, clearing a wide path for Lu Changsheng to pass through.</p><p></p><p>The girls, though extremely excited, maintained a final shred of restraint, suppressing the urge to rush towards him.</p><p></p><p>Soon, Lu Changsheng approached the crowd, preparing to leave the main path.</p><p></p><p>"Wow, up close the Qin Immortal is so handsome, truly a divine creation! I declare him the most handsome man in all of Tianxiang City! No, in all of the Yunlan Ancient Kingdom!"</p><p></p><p>"No way, the Qin Immortal is the most handsome in the entire world!! Ahhh!"</p><p></p><p>"Qin Immortal, I love you so much, waaah!!"</p><p></p><p>"Qin Immortal, I'm Afeng, please remember my name! If you remember my name, I will have no regrets even in death!"</p><p></p><p>The girls, though holding back physically, were frantic in their words, some even quite bold.</p><p></p><p>Even the men following behind the elder enviously admired Lu Changsheng, feeling a bitter ache in their hearts.</p><p></p><p>To these girls, Lu Changsheng only responded with a polite, gentle smile.</p><p></p><p>This smile, as refreshing as spring wind, only made the girls more infatuated and frenzied.</p><p></p><p>Suddenly, a deep, powerful male voice rang out, overpowering all others and stunning the girls.</p><p></p><p>"Qin Immortal, I've admired you for a long time, can I... can I have the chance to have dinner with you?"</p>

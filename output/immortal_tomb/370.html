        <h1>Chapter 370</h1>
        <div class="content">
            <p>Here is the full English translation of the Chinese excerpt:</p><p></p><p>Lü Changsheng's gaze shifted from the dense chains to the young boy. </p><p></p><p>The young boy's face was ferocious and terrifying. Although his eyes were calm, they seemed to want to devour someone.</p><p></p><p>The young boy suddenly grinned: "Big Brother, you're here."</p><p></p><p>Lü Changsheng's eyes were tranquil, as if a ghost, slowly floating in front of the young boy. After examining him up close, he said:</p><p></p><p>"May I assume that you were just toying with me just now? As a tower spirit, you should be intimately familiar with everything in the tower."</p><p></p><p>The young boy's eyes flickered, "I was not toying with you, Big Brother."</p><p></p><p>Lü Changsheng looked at him and smiled, "Then what's the matter?"</p><p></p><p>"If your explanation does not satisfy me... believe it or not, I can slap you to death."</p><p></p><p>Towards the end, Lü Changsheng's tone had a hint of coldness.</p><p></p><p>The young boy, upon hearing this, did not show much fear, but rather a trace of joy on his face: "Big Brother, can you really slap me to death?"</p><p></p><p>Lü Changsheng: "......"</p><p></p><p>Lü Changsheng admitted that this was the first time in his life that he was at a loss for words.</p><p></p><p>"Big Brother, I did not toy with you just now. It's just that before you found me, I couldn't see you," the young boy said softly.</p><p></p><p>Lü Changsheng raised his brow, surveying the surroundings with interest. He did not think this tower spirit was lying.</p><p></p><p>Both this tower and this tower spirit were rather intriguing.</p><p></p><p>Especially this tower spirit, who was bound by so many chains...</p><p></p><p>"What is the origin of this Colorful Jade Glass Tower?"</p><p></p><p>Lü Changsheng asked leisurely.</p><p></p><p>The young boy was silent for a moment, then replied, "Big Brother, this tower is not called the Colorful Jade Glass Tower."</p><p></p><p>He seemed to see the puzzlement in Lü Changsheng's eyes, so he explained, "The Colorful Jade Glass Tower is just the name given to it because of the colorful jade-like light emanating from the tower body on the battlefield of gods and demons."</p><p></p><p>"The original name of this tower is the Great Dao Subduing Demon Tower... and I... am that demon."</p><p></p><p>The Great Dao Subduing Demon Tower...</p><p></p><p>In that instant, Lü Changsheng's mind seemed to have been electrified, his gaze momentarily dazed.</p><p></p><p>That strange sensation vanished in an instant.</p><p></p><p>Lü Changsheng frowned and asked, "Since you are the demon that has been suppressed here, why do you call yourself a tower spirit?"</p><p></p><p>The young boy said dejectedly, "I have been suppressed for too, too long... the tower spirit doesn't even know how many years have passed. Now I am already familiar with and in control of everything in the Great Dao Subduing Demon Tower, to the point of being one with it, so calling myself a tower spirit is not an exaggeration."</p><p></p><p>Suddenly, the young boy raised his head abruptly, his expression ferocious: "Big Brother, your strength seems to be quite powerful! Can you really kill me? I want to be free! I want to be free!!"</p><p></p><p>He did not want to be suppressed here forever, he had had enough!</p><p></p><p>To be honest, Lü Changsheng was the most formidable person he had seen on the battlefield of gods and demons so far!</p><p></p><p>He saw a glimmer of hope of death, and if possible, he really wanted to die!!</p><p></p><p>Lü Changsheng lifted a chain and swung it, saying, "You haven't told me who it was that suppressed you here, and why they suppressed you here."</p><p></p><p>Upon hearing this, the young boy restrained his excited emotions and squinted his eyes painfully as he recalled, "I can't remember, it's been too long... I can't remember..."</p><p></p><p>"I don't know if it's truly that I can't remember... or if my memories have been erased..."</p><p></p><p>"I only know that the one who suppressed the tower spirit was terrifying, terrifying..."</p><p></p><p>Terrifying? </p><p></p><p>Lü Changsheng pondered for a while to no avail, then asked, "Since you can't remember who suppressed you..."</p><p></p><p>Here is the full English translation of the excerpt from the Chinese novel:</p><p></p><p>"Do you still remember why you were suppressed?" </p><p></p><p>The young boy suddenly had a bloodthirsty expression on his face and coldly laughed, "I remember that, because I have killed, hehe..."</p><p></p><p>Killed? </p><p></p><p>Lu Changsheng was slightly surprised. Killing was quite normal, he did it often, so he understood.</p><p></p><p>The young boy, seeing the expression on Lu Changsheng's face, seemed to know what he was thinking, and then sneered, "Senior, you must have misunderstood. Killing one or two, hundreds, thousands, or even millions and tens of millions, is naturally nothing. But what if I had slaughtered the living beings of dozens of great worlds?"</p><p></p><p>Lu Changsheng was slightly taken aback, and then nodded, "Mm, that would indeed be a bit too much."</p><p></p><p>"Hehe..." The boy's face showed a chilling smile, as if he was a little proud, and then exclaimed in surprise, "Senior, you don't seem very shocked?"</p><p></p><p>Lu Changsheng indifferently nodded, "No, I am actually a bit surprised."</p><p></p><p>"In that case, you were not wronged to be suppressed. That person didn't kill you, which is already not bad."</p><p></p><p>The boy suddenly became agitated, the chains around him clanking loudly, with a murderous aura, "I'd rather he had killed me!!"</p><p></p><p>Lu Changsheng had figured it out - the young boy in front of him was an absolute great demon.</p><p></p><p>To be honest, the number of people he had killed was far more than what Lu Changsheng had killed.</p><p></p><p>And Lu Changsheng asked himself, when he killed people, he generally had a reason.</p><p></p><p>"What kind of ability is suppressing me? If you have the guts, just kill me!!"</p><p></p><p>The boy swung the dense chains, growling, "How many years has it been, how many years! I've been suppressed in the dark, not seeing the light of day!!"</p><p></p><p>Slap!</p><p></p><p>Lu Changsheng suddenly slapped the boy's head, frowning, "Be quiet."</p><p></p><p>The boy fell silent.</p><p></p><p>Lu Changsheng looked at him and asked, "Since you've been suppressed for so long, if you were to break free, what would you want to do the most?"</p><p></p><p>The boy unhesitatingly, even a little excitedly, answered, "Kill people, of course kill people, I haven't killed anyone in a long time."</p><p></p><p>"If you want to kill people, wouldn't the myriad tribes in the tower be at your mercy?" Lu Changsheng said.</p><p></p><p>Unexpectedly, the boy shook his head, disappointed, "Too few, killing them would be boring, so I don't want to kill them."</p><p></p><p>Lu Changsheng nodded, then asked, "Does the Heavenly Dao of the Divine-Demon Battlefield know of your existence?"</p><p></p><p>"Don't know," the boy shook his head, then sneered, "If it knew, it would probably be scared to death, hehe."</p><p></p><p>Lu Changsheng looked at the boy, not knowing what he was thinking.</p><p></p><p>"Senior, you shouldn't be from the Divine-Demon Battlefield, your strength is among the top of what I've seen," the boy suddenly said.</p><p></p><p>Lu Changsheng asked curiously, "Just among the top?"</p><p></p><p>"Yes, just among the top." The boy finished speaking, and his eyes showed fear, "The most terrifying one is the one who suppressed me, although I can't remember clearly."</p><p></p><p>Lu Changsheng nodded slightly, becoming interested in the one who suppressed the boy.</p><p></p><p>He then asked, "Since you are so unruly, why do you still address me with respect?"</p><p></p><p>The boy's terrifying face showed a smile:</p><p></p><p>"Of course I have to address you respectfully. After so many years, I finally met someone powerful. Who knows, maybe you can kill me... Then I can be free. So Senior... Can you please try to kill me?"</p><p></p><p>Lu Changsheng looked at the boy in puzzlement and shook his head:</p><p></p><p>"The more you ask me to kill you, the less I will kill you. Moreover, I have no conflict or enmity with you, so why would I kill you?"</p>

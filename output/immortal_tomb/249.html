        <h1>Chapter 249</h1>
        <div class="content">
            <p>Here is the full English translation of the Chinese excerpt:</p><p></p><p>The light in the mirror's eyes trembled violently, and the usually calm temperament was struck heavily at this moment. üò≤üèÜ‚ùª‚ùæÔΩìÂçÑùì§ùîÅ.ÔΩÉ‚ìÑŒú‚òùüê®</p><p></p><p>"Disciple L√º, Mirror Observe... understands." </p><p></p><p>Mirror Observe looked gratefully at L√º Changsheng and slowly stood up, preparing to walk out of the medical clinic.</p><p></p><p>Tongxin was startled and quickly called out, "Master, what about the consultation fee?"</p><p></p><p>Mirror Observe paused, turned around, glanced at the tin staff leaning there, and then looked at L√º Changsheng, bowing and saying, "Disciple Mirror Observe has no money. May I use this tin staff as collateral? If I have the chance to see you again in the future, I will repay the consultation fee."</p><p></p><p>Tongxin was annoyed. Good, this bald donkey dares to come to their clinic without a penny, isn't this just letting the master treat him for free!</p><p></p><p>"Mm." L√º Changsheng agreed.</p><p></p><p>Tongxin fell silent.</p><p></p><p>"Mirror Observe thanks Disciple L√º." </p><p></p><p>Mirror Observe bowed, but this time did not clasp his hands in the Buddhist gesture as before.</p><p></p><p>Seeing this, Tongxin and Xiaotong were surprised. Could this bald donkey really have renounced the Buddhist path as the master said?</p><p></p><p>After that, Mirror Observe left the clinic and disappeared.</p><p></p><p>Tongxin went to the tin staff, looking it up and down, and couldn't help muttering, "Master, how much can this broken staff be worth?"</p><p></p><p>As he reached out to pick it up, his expression suddenly changed! </p><p></p><p>He glanced at the curious Xiaotong watching him, and his face flushed slightly.</p><p></p><p>What's going on with this staff!</p><p></p><p>Tongxin gripped it tightly, the veins on the back of his hand clearly visible, then suddenly exerted force!</p><p></p><p>But the tin staff did not budge at all.</p><p></p><p>Tongxin was dumbfounded, looking at the staff in front of him with great amazement. He had used so much force, yet the staff didn't even shake.</p><p></p><p>Tongxin thought of the somewhat unfathomable Mirror Observe, and his heart was somewhat relieved. It seems this tin staff really has something extraordinary about it.</p><p></p><p>It appears that his cultivation and strength are still not enough to shake this staff.</p><p></p><p>"Don't waste your effort. Even if there were ten thousand of you, you would still be unable to move this staff in the slightest." </p><p></p><p>At this time, L√º Changsheng smiled and said.</p><p></p><p>Tongxin's gaze was dazed. Ten thousand of him and still not enough? That's so exaggerated.</p><p></p><p>But since the master said it, of course Tongxin wouldn't dare to question it. The master wouldn't joke around with him like this.</p><p></p><p>It's just that at the moment, being stared at by Xiaotong's mysterious gaze, he felt quite embarrassed.</p><p></p><p>L√º Changsheng looked at Tongxin and said softly, "In the Ancestral Heavenly Realm, among the countless living beings, those who can lift this tin staff can be counted on less than five fingers."</p><p></p><p>Shhh!!</p><p></p><p>Tongxin sucked in a cold breath, his face filled with horror.</p><p></p><p>Even the naive Xiaotong was stunned.</p><p></p><p>Although she didn't understand much and didn't know the world outside Smoke and Rain Town, hearing that terrifying number and seeing Tongxin's exaggerated reaction, it must be something very formidable.</p><p></p><p>Tongxin's scalp felt numb.</p><p></p><p>He never imagined that the despicable bald donkey just now had such a big background!!</p><p></p><p>He knew the Ancestral Heavenly Realm was powerful. Apart from that, it surpassed the Four Directions Immortal Realms, the Heavenly Scar, and even the Linglong Heavens above. How could it not be powerful?</p><p></p><p>"Master... then, can you...?" Tongxin was a little confused as he asked.</p><p></p><p>"I can what?" </p><p></p><p>L√º Changsheng said, and with a light wave of his hand, the tin staff flew over and was lightly grasped in his hand. He even swung it lightly, as if it weighed nothing.</p><p></p><p>"Nothing." Tongxin's head shook like a rattle drum.</p><p></p><p>"Wow, Master, you're so powerful!" Xiaotong clapped her hands, her eyes sparkling with stars, her face full of admiration.</p><p></p><p>L√º Changsheng smiled, gently pushed the tin staff back to its original position, and then stood up, looking at Xiaotong and instructing, "You go get the medicine box, I'll take you..."</p><p></p><p>Here is the full English translation of the Chinese excerpt:</p><p></p><p>"Go to other towns to treat people," he said.</p><p></p><p>"Yes!" Little Tong heard this and was excited, quickly running to prepare.</p><p></p><p>Tongxin looked at him eagerly and carefully said, "Sir, what about me?"</p><p></p><p>Lu Changsheng glanced at him and said, "You stay in the clinic."</p><p></p><p>"Understood." Tongxin responded, but he was inwardly distressed. He had been cooped up in the clinic for a long time, and he also wanted to go out and wander around. Ah, he envied Little Tong.</p><p></p><p>Lu Changsheng suddenly handed him a package.</p><p></p><p>Tongxin received it in a daze and respectfully asked, "Sir, what is this...?"</p><p></p><p>But Lu Changsheng did not speak directly, instead smiling and saying, "While I'm away, you'll find a use for this."</p><p></p><p>"Okay." Tongxin did not ask further, just silently remembering the master's words.</p><p></p><p>Soon, Little Tong came running in front of Lu Changsheng, carrying a medicine box. "Sir, I'm all ready."</p><p></p><p>Lu Changsheng nodded slightly, then turned and walked out of the clinic.</p><p></p><p>Little Tong grinned at Tongxin and bounced off, chasing after him.</p><p></p><p>"Ah."</p><p></p><p>Tongxin weighed the item in his hand and sighed.</p><p></p><p>He then came to the side, crossed his legs, and prepared to cultivate.</p><p></p><p>He looked at the silver staff leaning there with some trepidation, then dispersed his distracting thoughts and slowly closed his eyes.</p><p></p><p>At the same time, </p><p></p><p>Lu Changsheng led Little Tong through the streets of Yanyu Town.</p><p></p><p>The townspeople curiously watched Lu Changsheng and Little Tong, greeting them one after another, not caring whether Lu Changsheng heard or not, just chatting casually.</p><p></p><p>A group of old men were currently sitting idly at the street corner, pulling and gesturing animatedly at a reluctant-looking Luo Gu, their faces flushed as they discussed something excitedly.</p><p></p><p>When they saw Lu Changsheng approaching, they were overjoyed and quickly stood up.</p><p></p><p>"Oh, Doctor Lu, where are you and Tong going?"</p><p></p><p>"Doctor Lu, your medicine is so good..."</p><p></p><p>"Pah pah pah, Tong is here, what are you blabbering about, medicine this and that? That's a tonic!!"</p><p></p><p>"Oh oh oh, a tonic, a tonic hehe."</p><p></p><p>What tonic? Little Tong looked puzzled.</p><p></p><p>Lu Changsheng swept a glance at them, finally fixing his gaze on the embarrassed Luo Gu, with a half-smile, "Tonics are like strong liquor, you old fellows mustn't overindulge..."</p><p></p><p>Luo Gu had a sudden realization, awkwardly responding, "Doctor Lu is absolutely right!"</p><p></p><p>He secretly smiled, looking at the obviously unaware old companions. The guilt could not just be his alone.</p><p></p><p>These old fellows had just united to bully him, hmph.</p><p></p><p>.........</p><p></p><p>The sky was clear like a blue paper, a few thin white clouds, as if scorched by the sun, drifting slowly in the wind.</p><p></p><p>Under the azure sky, in the swaying sea of mountain flowers.</p><p></p><p>A solitary grave faintly visible.</p><p></p><p>In the distance, Jinguan walked barefoot towards the lonely grave.</p><p></p><p>The tattered robe he had worn was gone, and now he was dressed in a black robe, his aged face serene.</p><p></p><p>With each step of his bare feet, gradually, gradually, the scar on his head disappeared, the wrinkles on his face vanished, and his skin became delicate. </p><p></p><p>Those eyes without sorrow or joy now became lively, and a warm smile appeared at the corners of his mouth.</p><p></p><p>Somehow, he now had a head of flowing black hair.</p><p></p><p>Jinguan had transformed from the old monk to a handsome young man, the appearance he had when he met the woman.</p><p></p><p>Soon, Jinguan arrived at the grave and stood before it.</p><p></p><p>He looked at the nameless gravestone, using his finger as a knife, and began to write.</p><p></p><p>'The wife of Li Shuyan, Su Rou√°n rests here.'</p><p></p><p>Jinguan sat down cross-legged in front of the lonely grave, silently gazing at it for a long, long time, his eyes shining, a smile playing on his lips as he murmured, </p><p></p><p>"Pigeon... you've returned."</p>

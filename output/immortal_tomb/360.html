        <h1>Chapter 360</h1>
        <div class="content">
            <p>Here is the full English translation of the Chinese excerpt:</p><p></p><p>Jiang Wuxin looked at the crowd and saw that they all remembered, so he frowned and asked:</p><p></p><p>"How is the training of my Wind and Thunder Instant Divine Steps going?"</p><p></p><p>Hearing this, the crowd scratched their heads, looking embarrassed and somewhat fearful as they looked at Jiang Wuxin.</p><p></p><p>A middle-aged man of the Shenxuan Realm from Tiancheng bowed and said apologetically, "Venerable Wind Xing, the difficulty of cultivating your Wind and Thunder Instant Divine Steps is extremely high. Even though it's just the first volume, we... we still don't quite understand it..."</p><p></p><p>This middle-aged man was named Fang Yin, and he was the strongest Shenxuan Realm cultivator in Tiancheng. </p><p></p><p>In fact, he could be considered the strongest Shenxuan Realm cultivator in the human race, stronger than the number one in Dicheng and Moluoqiu in Rencheng.</p><p></p><p>After all, Tiancheng was under the management of Jian Wuhui, so it was only natural.</p><p></p><p>Hearing this, Moluoqiu and the others looked embarrassed and nodded. When they had been sitting together earlier, they had already discussed and found that everyone had not fully grasped the Wind and Thunder Instant Divine Steps.</p><p></p><p>"Hmph, are you all just a bunch of fools?! I gave you the first volume of the Wind and Thunder Instant Divine Steps long ago, hoping that you would perform well in the Seven-Colored Crystal Tower!" </p><p></p><p>"Now the Crystal Heart is about to begin, and you're telling me you haven't mastered it?"</p><p></p><p>Jiang Wuxin flicked his sleeve, his expression not looking good, and it was clear that he was truly angry.</p><p></p><p>"Venerable Wind Xing, please calm down!" </p><p></p><p>Fang Yin and Moluoqiu and the others paled and hurriedly knelt down.</p><p></p><p>Jiang Wuxin looked at them coldly and sighed disappointedly, "You all, you're really not up to par..."</p><p></p><p>Jiang Wuxin was worried at the moment. If this group couldn't even master the first volume of the Wind and Thunder Instant Divine Steps, then they might not have much advantage in the Seven-Colored Crystal Tower.</p><p></p><p>The crowd trembled and kept their heads down, not daring to speak.</p><p></p><p>Only Zhao Di, who was kneeling at the side, didn't feel too much pressure, after all, he was just here to watch the competition, and his qualification had already been replaced by Senior Luchang Sheng.</p><p></p><p>Beside them, Han Jinlong and Luchang Sheng were sitting, drinking wine occasionally.</p><p></p><p>After a moment, Han Jinlong stepped forward to smooth things over, chuckling, "Ah, Venerable Wind Xing, you're also demanding too much of them. Your Wind and Thunder Instant Divine Steps, how easy could it be to cultivate? Even if it was this king, I might not be able to cultivate it successfully either."</p><p></p><p>"This thing, doesn't it require talent and affinity? Not everyone can be like you, with extraordinary natural talent in speed."</p><p></p><p>Hearing this, Jiang Wuxin's expression softened a bit. The logic was indeed like that.</p><p></p><p>If the Wind and Thunder Instant Divine Steps were so easy to cultivate, there wouldn't just be one Venerable Wind Xing in the human race.</p><p></p><p>"Alright, you may all rise."</p><p></p><p>Jiang Wuxin waved his sleeve, looking quite helpless.</p><p></p><p>"Yes..."</p><p></p><p>The crowd carefully stood up, they were truly frightened. Fortunately, King Jinlun had pleaded for them.</p><p></p><p>Although they were the peak combat forces in the human race, they were still insignificant before the supreme human lord. </p><p></p><p>If Venerable Wind Xing really meant business, a single finger from him could reduce them to ashes.</p><p></p><p>Of course, Venerable Wind Xing probably wouldn't do that.</p><p></p><p>"What are you still standing in front of me for? Blocking my sight?"</p><p></p><p>Jiang Wuxin frowned.</p><p></p><p>Fang Yin, Moluoqiu and the others hurriedly bowed and retreated to the edge of the Blazing Sun Heavenly Wheel.</p><p></p><p>"Sigh."</p><p></p><p>Jiang Wuxin sighed, then re-erected a sound isolation barrier and looked at Luchang Sheng and Han Jinlong with a bitter smile, "I'm afraid the Seven-Colored Crystal Tower this time will be difficult."</p><p></p><p>Han Jinlong pursed his lips and said, "Venerable Wind Xing, I understand your feelings, but don't worry. With Senior Luchang Sheng here, even if it goes badly, it won't go too badly."</p><p></p><p>Here is the full English translation of the Chinese excerpt:</p><p></p><p>"Haha," Han Jinlong laughed. "Venerable Wind, our Dao Companion Long Sheng has defeated Zhao Di with a single move."</p><p></p><p>Hearing this, Jiang Wuxin's face lit up with delight as he looked at Long Sheng. "Dao Companion Long Sheng, your strength is truly remarkable to be able to defeat Zhao Di with a single move. You must be the number one Mystic Immortal among our human race!"</p><p></p><p>After all, even the mighty Fang Yun from the Heavenly City would likely have difficulty defeating Zhao Di in a single move.</p><p></p><p>With Long Sheng's presence, the outcome of this session of the Seven-Colored Jade Tower competition should be promising, even if the human race's performance has been dismal in the past.</p><p></p><p>However, Jiang Wuxin soon fell silent again, realizing that in the Seven-Colored Jade Tower, the human race would undoubtedly be targeted by the other races.</p><p></p><p>Long Sheng suddenly asked, "In the previous sessions of the Seven-Colored Jade Tower, how many Jade Hearts have the human race obtained?"</p><p></p><p>Hearing this, Jiang Wuxin and Han Jinlong exchanged a glance and cleared their throats in unison.</p><p></p><p>"Dao Companion Long Sheng, you are unaware, but the human race's performance in the previous Seven-Colored Jade Tower competitions has been dismal," Han Jinlong said with a wry smile.</p><p></p><p>Jiang Wuxin frankly admitted, "Our best result was obtaining three Jade Hearts, and the worst... we didn't even get a single one."</p><p></p><p>Long Sheng was not surprised, having anticipated as much. He then asked, "So how many Jade Hearts are there in total in the Seven-Colored Jade Tower? Since it's a competition among all the races, the number must be quite substantial."</p><p></p><p>"There is no limit to the number," Han Jinlong replied, pursing his lips. "However, there is a time limit - all the races have only ten days to compete within the Seven-Colored Jade Tower."</p><p></p><p>"Then how many Jade Hearts can the top-ranked races on the Myriad Races Ranking obtain each time?" Long Sheng asked, looking up at the Myriad Races Ranking in the sky.</p><p></p><p>Han Jinlong's expression grew solemn, and he and Jiang Wuxin looked up at the Myriad Races Ranking, their eyes filled with envy.</p><p></p><p>The names of the top-ranked races, such as the Celestial Tribe, Devouring Beast Tribe, Dragon Tribe, Phoenix Tribe, White Tiger Tribe, and Black Tortoise Tribe, were clearly visible.</p><p></p><p>"These peak apex tribes... the weaker ones can obtain dozens of Jade Hearts, while the stronger ones can obtain hundreds, even thousands!" Jiang Wuxin said, his voice tinged with bitterness.</p><p></p><p>The Jade Hearts were truly precious. They could help peak Godly Immortal realm cultivators break through to the Mystic Immortal realm. These apex tribes, as long as they could utilize the Jade Hearts well, could even cultivate dozens of Mystic Immortal realm experts within their tribes.</p><p></p><p>What a terrifying number, when the human race currently only had around a hundred Mystic Immortal realm cultivators.</p><p></p><p>And these apex tribes, with their accumulated wealth over the years, likely had Mystic Immortal realm experts in numbers far exceeding the human race.</p><p></p><p>"Hmph, so what?" Han Jinlong scoffed, waving his hand dismissively. "If it weren't for those other races targeting us, with our own strength, how could our ranking on the Myriad Races Ranking be so low, and how could we have only obtained a few Jade Hearts in the past sessions?"</p><p></p><p>"The Sword Sovereign's ranking on the Individual Strength Ranking speaks for itself!" he declared.</p>

        <h1>Chapter 261</h1>
        <div class="content">
            <p>Here is my translation of the Chinese text you provided:</p><p></p><p>Far beyond a million miles. üéÖüòæ‚ùªÔºôùêíùêáùìäùîÅ.ÔΩÉùïÜÁà™üêâ‚ôß</p><p></p><p>Jinguan stared blankly at the horizon, which was like the end of the world, and the usually calm and tranquil emotions in his heart were slightly trembling at this moment.</p><p></p><p>Heavenly... Dao.</p><p></p><p>The dialogue that just resounded...</p><p></p><p>It was Heavenly Dao and Master Lu!</p><p></p><p>Jinguan recalled the tyrannical words of Lu Changsheng just now, and his heart tightened, and he began to worry about Lu Changsheng, and then flashed towards that direction!</p><p></p><p>"Master Lu... Please don't go against the Heavenly Dao..."</p><p></p><p>.........</p><p></p><p>Milo Snow Mountain.</p><p></p><p>Above the azure sky, the clouds rolled and the thunder rumbled.</p><p></p><p>An unprecedented great momentum filled every corner of the heavens and the earth.</p><p></p><p>The people in the venue were in a mess, sweating profusely. Although the momentum of the Heavenly Dao did not target them, it still pressed them down and made them unable to breathe.</p><p></p><p>Yinyao and others looked up at the young man in blue standing in the air, feeling awe-struck and disbelieving at the same time.</p><p></p><p>Before today, who had ever seen someone provoke the Heavenly Dao!</p><p></p><p>Moreover, the Heavenly Dao of the Ancestral Celestial Realm!</p><p></p><p>Today, even if the young man in blue died at the hands of the Heavenly Dao, that would be unprecedented!</p><p></p><p>Xintian's heart was pounding fiercely at the moment. Not to mention the Heavenly Dao of the Ancestral Celestial Realm, even the Heavenly Dao of the Four Directions Immortal Realms or the Spiritual Dust Realm, he would not dare to provoke them easily!</p><p></p><p>Cough, whether he can defeat it or not is not the point,</p><p></p><p>Because once you provoke a Heavenly Dao, if discovered, you will be targeted and hunted down by countless Heavenly Daos!</p><p></p><p>Who in the world dares to provoke the Heavenly Dao?</p><p></p><p>As for Chu Lingyan and Yuan Yangshou, they had already been scared out of their wits.</p><p></p><p>The sudden situation today was something no one could have foreseen, and no one could have foreseen that even the supreme Heavenly Dao would appear.</p><p></p><p>Lu Changsheng stood in the air, with countless gazes focused on him.</p><p></p><p>At this moment!</p><p></p><p>A rift opened in the void, and a young monk hurriedly stepped out!</p><p></p><p>The monk looked worriedly at Lu Changsheng, then looked up at the azure sky, clasped his hands together, and bowed, saying, "Great Heavenly Dao, do not take Master Lu's words to heart. For his unintentional provocation, this humble monk apologizes to you on his behalf."</p><p></p><p>As he spoke, the monk knelt in the air, his attitude sincere.</p><p></p><p>"Buddha, Buddha Master!!"</p><p></p><p>The monks of Tianyin Temple were dumbfounded, shouting in surprise at the young monk in the sky.</p><p></p><p>"Master Jinguan?" </p><p></p><p>Yinyao and Zhang Shengxu were also stunned on the spot.</p><p></p><p>Wasn't Jinguan already in nirvana? Today, everyone had come to attend his memorial service!</p><p></p><p>But now, he was alive and well, appearing before their eyes.</p><p></p><p>Tianyin Temple would not fake such a thing...</p><p></p><p>Could it be... that he had attained the Buddha body?</p><p></p><p>Yinyao and Zhang Shengxu's eyes narrowed slightly.</p><p></p><p>......</p><p></p><p>The thunderous sky did not respond to Jinguan's words.</p><p></p><p>Lu Changsheng's brow slightly furrowed as he looked at Jinguan and said indifferently, "Too much nonsense, get out of the way."</p><p></p><p>Jinguan was slightly taken aback, and turned his head to look at Lu Changsheng, transmitting, "Master Lu, the might of the Heavenly Dao is unassailable, you..."</p><p></p><p>"Didn't you hear me? I told you to get out of the way!" </p><p></p><p>Lu Changsheng lost his patience and slapped out in the air, as if swatting a fly.</p><p></p><p>Boom!!</p><p></p><p>In the space, there was no abnormality.</p><p></p><p>But Jinguan's face suddenly turned pale, as if he had been struck heavily. His body suddenly burst with golden light, and dense Buddha seals appeared on his skin!</p><p></p><p>But soon, his skin cracked open, and the Buddha seals dimmed!</p><p></p><p>In an instant, he became a bloody person!</p><p></p><p>Pu!</p><p></p><p>Jinguan suddenly spat out a mouthful of fresh blood, fell from the sky, and crashed into the venue!</p><p></p><p>Rumble--!</p><p></p><p>The ground of the venue was shattered and a huge pit appeared!</p><p></p><p>Jinguan lay in the pit, his chest heaving violently, crazily coughing up blood!</p><p></p><p>Although he had suffered a heavy blow, his Buddha body was cracked and his whole body was in excruciating pain, but at this moment, his heart was filled with horror!!</p><p></p><p>Here is the full English translation of the Chinese excerpt:</p><p></p><p>The Venerable Lu is truly unfathomable to this extent. </p><p></p><p>The Buddha body he has achieved after enduring the tribulations of nine lifetimes with great difficulty was actually unable to withstand a single strike...!</p><p></p><p>Jing Guan knew that Lu Changsheng had held back against him.</p><p></p><p>This scene also filled Yinyao, Zhang Shengxu, and the others with terror!!</p><p></p><p>They had clearly seen Jing Guan's abnormality earlier, and that was undoubtedly a Buddha body!</p><p></p><p>Jing Guan had indeed attained a Buddha body!</p><p></p><p>But what terrified them was not this, but that Jing Guan's Buddha body could not even withstand a single palm strike from Lu Changsheng!!</p><p></p><p>"Buddha, Buddha Master!" </p><p></p><p>Huihai and the other monks regained their senses and quickly leaped into the huge pit to support the heavily injured Jing Guan.</p><p></p><p>The people present all looked at the Buddha Master covered in blood with disbelief.</p><p></p><p>Finally, they turned their gaze to the figure in blue robes in the sky.</p><p></p><p>Their eyes were filled with fear.</p><p></p><p>They couldn't help but ask themselves, in the Ancestral Heavenly Realm, apart from the Heavenly Dao, who else could rival the formidable power displayed by the man in blue robes?</p><p></p><p>If it weren't for this meaningless consecration ceremony.</p><p></p><p>The crowd feared that even until death, they would not dare to believe that in the Ancestral Heavenly Realm, there could be someone with the ability to subdue a Dao Master with a single finger and destroy a Buddha Master with a single palm strike!!!</p><p></p><p>.........</p><p></p><p>Rumbling.</p><p></p><p>The thunders of a hundred million miles of heaven and earth roared, and the winds howled.</p><p></p><p>In this space filled with the majestic might of the heavens, all beings were as insignificant as ants, daring not to even take a breath.</p><p></p><p>In the heavens and earth, only a figure in blue robes stood, his gaze as deep as the sea!</p><p></p><p>Unafraid, facing the vast sky alone!</p><p></p><p>Suddenly, particles like stars appeared in the sky, gradually coalescing into a towering illusory figure!</p><p></p><p>The incarnation of the Heavenly Dao!</p><p></p><p>The crowd was shocked and trembled, kneeling in fear.</p><p></p><p>The next moment, the voice of the Heavenly Might accompanied by thunderous roars:</p><p></p><p>"Lu Changsheng, I know your cultivation is unparalleled, and since the time when those people suppressed you hundreds of thousands of years ago, I have known this."</p><p></p><p>"No matter who you kill, I can turn a blind eye and give you some face, but the Shen Yuan Realm is only a handful among the countless beings in this world!"</p><p></p><p>"The Dao of the Four Directions Immortal Realms, the Heavenly Scars, the Linglong Heavens, those three worlds do not want to provoke trouble for you, so you feel you can do as you please!"</p><p></p><p>"You... must not go too far."</p><p></p><p>Hearing these words echoing through the heavens and earth, </p><p></p><p>the crowd's breathing quickened, their chests feeling as if crushed by a massive boulder, suffocating.</p><p></p><p>This man in blue robes was actually so terrifying that even the Dao of various realms showed him deference!</p><p></p><p>Upon hearing this, Lu Changsheng's expression remained unchanged, only a slight coldness flickering in his eyes. He said indifferently,</p><p></p><p>"Do you think this is your domain, and that I can't harm you, or that you're confident I won't dare to kill you?"</p><p></p><p>Hearing these words, the towering incarnation of the Heavenly Dao seemed to waver. He said, "Lu Changsheng, you are indeed arrogant and contemptuous. I am the source of the Ancestral Heavenly Realm, and this world is not comparable to the Four Directions Immortal Realms. What can you use to kill me?"</p><p></p><p>"You must leave the Ancestral Heavenly Realm immediately, and I will not pursue this matter further."</p><p></p><p>He was indeed wary of Lu Changsheng, but he also believed that Lu Changsheng would not dare to fight him.</p><p></p><p>If he were to be annihilated, Lu Changsheng would be hunted down endlessly by all the Dao, and the Ancestral Heavenly Realm would also collapse, with the countless living beings within... all dying!</p><p></p><p>...</p><p></p><p>In the venue, Yinyao and the others stared with wide eyes, their mouths slightly open, filled with disbelief.</p><p></p><p>They could hear that the Heavenly Dao seemed to be somewhat wary of Lu Changsheng and did not directly destroy him, but instead spoke to expel him...</p><p></p><p>In the sky, Lu Changsheng looked at the towering illusory figure, and the strange blue light in his eyes began to slowly rotate...</p><p></p><p>He said coldly:</p><p></p><p>"Do you know that sometimes, in order to save face, one may end up paying the price with their life..."</p><p></p><p>"Since you're confident that I won't dare to kill you, then you should just die."</p>

        <h1>Chapter 308</h1>
        <div class="content">
            <p>Here is the full English translation of the Chinese excerpt:</p><p></p><p>Boom, boom, boom, boom...</p><p></p><p>The next moment, a dense chorus of kneeling sounds arose. ‚ô°üí£‚ùª‚ûà‰∏Ç‚ìó‡∏¢‚ìß.ùìíœÉùì∂üíôüíù</p><p></p><p>Soon, apart from the bowing Li Shuyan and Xue Yue, as well as the three members of the Ancient Desolate Sword Clan, all the others on the square had knelt down!</p><p></p><p>In the center of the square, Lu Changsheng stood with his hands behind his back, like a sovereign!</p><p></p><p>"Senior, that scum Zhou Zhenjiang, we, we are innocent..."</p><p>"Senior, please spare our lives, we are innocent..."</p><p>"..."</p><p></p><p>Countless pleas for mercy rang out, and the Heavenly Emperors had already come to kneel behind their elders, filled with fear.</p><p></p><p>If their own elders were frantically begging for mercy, which of the renowned major powers kneeling here was not?</p><p></p><p>After what had just happened, they knew that the senior in the blue robe was not joking!</p><p></p><p>To him, they were perhaps no different than ants.</p><p></p><p>If he was in a good mood, he would let them go, if he was in a bad mood, he would casually crush them.</p><p></p><p>The Nangong Clan Leader, Duan Jiu Xiong, Miao Hantian, and others were also kneeling there, extremely nervous.</p><p></p><p>Normally, they considered themselves Shenzang Realm experts, full of grace and vigor.</p><p></p><p>But when faced with a cultivator stronger than them, they were like clay chickens and pottery dogs.</p><p></p><p>What Shenzang Realm? It was truly laughable.</p><p></p><p>After a moment,</p><p></p><p>A trace of mercy flashed in Lu Changsheng's eyes, and he suddenly waved his sleeve: "The death penalty can be forgiven, but the living penalty cannot be escaped!"</p><p></p><p>"Shhh, shhh, shhh, shhh, shhh...!"</p><p></p><p>The next moment, except for Li Shuyan, Xue Yue, and Liu Tu, Fu Liancai, Miao Hantian and others who were slightly familiar with Lu Changsheng,</p><p></p><p>The arms of all the other people were severed, accompanied by the loss of some of their cultivation!</p><p></p><p>The faces of the crowd suddenly turned deathly pale, but they tightly bit their lips and dared not make a sound.</p><p></p><p>Having their arms severed was not a very serious matter for many of them.</p><p></p><p>It was the loss of their cultivation that would take them several thousand years to recover.</p><p></p><p>However, they knew that this was the best outcome for them.</p><p></p><p>The senior had spared their lives.</p><p></p><p>At this moment, the crowd hated Zhou Zhenjiang to death, and they could foresee that after the Heavenly Emperor's Assembly was over, the Zhou Clan in the Royal City would be instantly annihilated by them!</p><p></p><p>"We... thank the senior for his mercy."</p><p></p><p>Duan Jiu Xiong, the Nangong Clan Leader, and others expressed their gratitude in a rather weak voice.</p><p></p><p>Their cultivation had also been greatly reduced, but at least they were alive, and their cultivation would eventually recover.</p><p></p><p>However, their awe and fear towards this senior had only deepened...</p><p></p><p>In this vast square, he had simply waved his sleeve and precisely severed the arms and cultivation of everyone.</p><p></p><p>It was truly terrifying!</p><p></p><p>Miao Hantian, Liu Tu, Fu Liancai, Liu Qing, and Fu Shiyu, although also kneeling on the ground, were undoubtedly in a much better condition, without the slightest injury.</p><p></p><p>They looked at the senior in blue robes, who was like a king on the square, and secretly rejoiced that they had established a good relationship with him in advance.</p><p></p><p>Fu Shiyu had already guessed that Lu Changsheng was very strong, being the mysterious figure who had fought against the five Boundless Heavenly Dao in the endless void. But when she truly witnessed Lu Changsheng's actions, the sense of terror was completely different.</p><p></p><p>Previously, she still had a bit of admiration for Lu Changsheng, that kind of admiration for a powerful expert. But at this moment, that sentiment had completely disappeared, leaving only endless awe.</p><p></p><p>&lt;tt_keyword_ad data-title="Game" data-tag="Featured Recommendations" data-type="1" data-value="1913"&gt;&lt;/tt_keyword_ad&gt;</p><p></p><p>"Let's go!"</p><p></p><p>At this moment,</p><p></p><p>The purple-robed elder suddenly grabbed two young men and turned to tear open the space and flee!</p><p></p><p>The purple-robed elder</p><p></p><p>Here is the full English translation of the Chinese excerpt:</p><p></p><p>To his shock and horror, he discovered that the space he had previously been able to tear open with ease had now become impregnable!</p><p></p><p>"You want to run? Where are you going to run to?"</p><p></p><p>L√º Changsheng looked at the back of the purple-robed elder and asked.</p><p></p><p>The purple-robed elder's back stiffened, and he and the two other young men slowly turned around.</p><p></p><p>"Fellow Daoist... from which ancient clan do you hail?" the purple-robed elder asked calmly.</p><p></p><p>But those present could all hear a slight tremor in the voice of the Sword Servant.</p><p></p><p>It was an act, the calmness was an act.</p><p></p><p>Indeed, who would not fear death? Just because they were from the ancient Huangshen Sword Clan, did that mean they did not fear death? That was impossible.</p><p></p><p>But soon, the crowd was filled with doubt and suspicion!</p><p></p><p>The Eight Great Ancient Clans?</p><p></p><p>But when they recalled the strength of the Senior in blue, they felt relieved.</p><p></p><p>Ah, they should have realized it earlier - a powerful expert like him could not have come from the Eight Great Ancient Clans, so where else could he be from?</p><p></p><p>It seems to be a conflict between the Eight Great Ancient Clans.</p><p></p><p>Only the few from the Fu Clan knew that the Senior in blue was not from the Eternal Celestial Realm...</p><p></p><p>Thinking deeply, it was truly terrifying - besides the Eternal Celestial Realm, there must be even more powerful worlds!</p><p></p><p>The Senior in blue must be from such a more powerful world!</p><p></p><p>L√º Changsheng looked steadily at the purple-robed elder, a flash of insight in his eyes.</p><p></p><p>Given the lesson of the Blood Demon Moon, he did not dare to probe his mind, lest he destroy those memories.</p><p></p><p>Ah yes, L√º Changsheng suddenly realized that he had been a bit foolish.</p><p></p><p>Using the Great Dao Eye to control the purple-robed elder, just like he had controlled the Blood Demon Moon, wouldn't that work?</p><p></p><p>That way, the purple-robed elder's memories would not be lost.</p><p></p><p>Hehe, such a simple thing, and he had actually overlooked it...</p><p></p><p>It seems he had become too obsessed with soul-searching.</p><p></p><p>L√º Changsheng then looked at the purple-robed elder and said, "Look at me."</p><p></p><p>"Hm?"</p><p></p><p>The purple-robed elder was startled, and instinctively looked over, quickly becoming dazed, his gaze sinking into that azure hue.</p><p></p><p>Immediately, to the horrified eyes of the onlookers, he knelt down before L√º Changsheng: "Master, Jian Yan pays his respects."</p><p></p><p>L√º Changsheng nodded in satisfaction, this was good.</p><p></p><p>"You... what have you done to the Sword Servant?"</p><p></p><p>The two young men from the ancient Huangshen Sword Clan were utterly horrified, they didn't even know what had happened. The Sword Servant had just obediently knelt down and addressed the Senior in blue as his master!</p><p></p><p>Not to mention them, who among the onlookers did not feel a chill in their hearts at this ghostly and supernatural display?</p><p></p><p>It was simply unimaginable.</p><p></p><p>L√º Changsheng looked at the two young men, his brow slightly furrowed. Now was not the time to kill them.</p><p></p><p>Presumably, they had soul lamps or life medallions in the ancient Huangshen Sword Clan, and if he provoked the ancient Huangshen Sword Clan, that would not be good.</p><p></p><p>He then simply took control of the two young men as well.</p><p></p><p>"Master."</p><p></p><p>Seeing the three members of the ancient Huangshen Sword Clan - the Servant and the two young men - all showing the utmost reverence towards L√º Changsheng, the crowd was in disarray.</p><p></p><p>L√º Changsheng looked at Fu Shiyue and the others and said indifferently, "Then let us part ways here."</p><p></p><p>"Farewell, Senior!" </p><p></p><p>Liu Tu and the others hurriedly paid their respects.</p><p></p><p>"Farewell, Senior!" Duan Jiu Xiong and the others also knew that L√º Changsheng was about to leave, and they hurriedly paid their respects to see him off.</p><p></p><p>"Master."</p><p></p><p>Jian Yan looked at L√º Changsheng respectfully, awaiting his instructions.</p><p></p><p>"Let's go."</p><p></p><p>In the next moment, L√º Changsheng, Jian Yan, and the other celestial prodigies like Li Shuoyan left the square!</p><p></p><p>"Phew~~~"</p><p></p><p>Immediately, countless sighs of relief rang out in the square.</p><p></p><p>The tense nerves of the crowd finally relaxed, for this Celestial Prodigy Convention was like the Gates of Hell for them.</p><p></p><p>It was more thrilling than any previous session.</p><p></p><p>Soon, the crowd was filled with anticipation - the Senior in blue was from another ancient clan, and his visit to the ancient Huangshen Sword Clan was clearly not for good intentions.</p><p></p><p>Perhaps there would be an earth-shattering battle ahead!</p><p></p><p>As for Fu Shiyue and Liu Tu, they looked at the direction in which L√º Changsheng had disappeared with a hint of worry in their eyes.</p><p></p><p>After all, that was the ancient Huangshen Sword Clan...</p>

        <h1>Chapter 384</h1>
        <div class="content">
            <p>Here is the full English translation of the Chinese excerpt:</p><p></p><p>"Yes!" </p><p></p><p>The cultivators hurriedly responded, then returned in a grand manner to the human realm.</p><p></p><p>"Jian Wuhui, when my divine father and the other peak clan leaders arrive, I don't believe that blue-robed man can stop us..."</p><p></p><p>Shen Luo said in a low voice. Now that Lu Changsheng was not present, he felt he could act recklessly again.</p><p></p><p>Although the faces of Wind Jun, Bai Qianmo and the others did not look good, they kept their heads down, not daring to shout like Shen Luo.</p><p></p><p>The shock brought by the blue-robed man just now was simply too strong, and they were still uneasy about it.</p><p></p><p>Hearing this, the five of Jian Wuhui's expressions hardened. They did not expect Shen Luo to still dare to shout in this situation. Didn't he hear Lao Ren's words just now?</p><p></p><p>"Slap!"</p><p></p><p>Mangtian suddenly slapped Shen Luo's face and shouted, "Don't think I don't dare to hit you! You are now a prisoner!"</p><p></p><p>Shen Luo was stunned for a moment by the slap, glaring at Mangtian angrily and saying, "You wait... wait until my father rescues the divine son, and I will definitely make you pay the price!!"</p><p></p><p>Seeing this, Jian Wuhui and the others shook their heads. This Shen Luo, although a divine son of the Heavenly God Clan, had also developed an arrogant personality.</p><p></p><p>"Who do you want to make pay the price?"</p><p></p><p>At this moment, Lu Changsheng's voice sounded.</p><p></p><p>Shen Luo suddenly trembled, his gaze becoming clear, and he lowered his head, no longer daring to speak.</p><p></p><p>Mangtian laughed and sneered, "You bully the weak and fear the strong, yet you call yourself a divine son? Tsk!"</p><p></p><p>Shen Luo bit his teeth and ignored Mangtian, keeping his head down.</p><p></p><p>"Lord Jian, does this place need to be cleaned up?"</p><p></p><p>At this time, a powerful divine cultivator came before Jian Wuhui and asked.</p><p></p><p>Jian Wuhui looked at the mountain of corpses and blood sea, pondered for a moment, and then said, "No need to clean up, let's go back!"</p><p></p><p>After saying that, he led the others to return to the human realm, leaving behind the mountain of corpses and blood sea.</p><p></p><p>...</p><p></p><p>Subsequently, Jian Wuhui and the others followed Lu Changsheng's instructions and hung Shen Luo and the others on the city walls of the Heavenly City.</p><p></p><p>Shen Luo and the others had never suffered such humiliation. They felt the countless gazes of the cultivators and wished they could find a crack in the ground to crawl into.</p><p></p><p>They simply closed their eyes, hoping to be out of sight.</p><p></p><p>They believed that the events that happened in the human realm would soon spread throughout the entire Divine-Demon Battlefield!</p><p></p><p>At that time, the pressure from all tribes would come again!</p><p></p><p>But this time, the pressure from all tribes would not be as simple as before.</p><p></p><p>After all, the tribes that came this time were not the full force.</p><p></p><p>Next time, it may be that the clan leaders of the top hundred clans will descend, and they may even bring countless powerful foreign cultivators.</p><p></p><p>The terrifying numbers would be incomparable to this time.</p><p></p><p>That would be the true pressure from all tribes, unstoppable for the human realm, even the blue-robed man would not be able to stop it!</p><p></p><p>...</p><p></p><p>At the same time, in an unknown place in the Soul Realm:</p><p></p><p>"Report! Soul Emperor, a massive amount of souls have suddenly flooded into the Demon Soul Realm today!"</p><p></p><p>"Report! Soul Emperor, a massive amount of souls have suddenly flooded into the Devil Soul Realm today!"</p><p></p><p>"Report! Soul Emperor, a massive amount of souls have suddenly flooded into the Beast Soul Realm today!"</p><p></p><p>"......"</p><p></p><p>"Soul Emperor, with such a sudden influx of souls, we are having trouble handling it. The order in each realm is in disarray!"</p><p></p><p>Hearing the reports coming one after another, Hunhun's face darkened!</p><p></p><p>The Soul Realm was not just one realm, but divided into countless realms, encompassing everything. Each realm had a manifestation of Hunhun overseeing it.</p><p></p><p>So Hunhun was fully aware of all the situations.</p><p></p><p>Finally, Hunhun could no longer endure it. He slammed the table and stood up, roaring:</p><p></p><p>"Outrageous, simply outrageous!! What has happened in the outside world!!!"</p><p></p><p>In the vast hall, no one responded to him.</p><p></p><p>Seeing the Soul Emperor's anger, the soul servants outside the hall all...</p><p></p><p>Here is the full English translation of the Chinese excerpt:</p><p></p><p>Trembling with fear, he could only pretend not to hear, otherwise he would be facing the gun barrel.</p><p></p><p>"Come here!" Hunhui shouted with a gloomy face.</p><p></p><p>Soon, several soul servants came to the hall, kneeling and trembling: "Your Majesty, the Soul Emperor!"</p><p></p><p>Hunhui took a deep breath and then waved his hand: "Forget it."</p><p></p><p>With that, his burly figure flashed and disappeared from the hall, leaving the soul servants dumbfounded.</p><p></p><p>At the same time, Hunhui's avatars in various realms, through the reports of his subordinates, learned that such a large number of souls had almost all surged from a place called the Shenmo Battlefield.</p><p></p><p>"The Shenmo Battlefield??" </p><p></p><p>Hunhui's eyes flickered.</p><p></p><p>He knew about the relatively special Shenmo Battlefield, as it was a major world where the outflow of souls was relatively large.</p><p></p><p>But normally it wasn't this many. How could so many souls suddenly emerge like this?</p><p></p><p>Could something have happened there? </p><p></p><p>Had the myriad tribes finally gone to war?</p><p></p><p>No, he had to go take a look himself. If it continued like this, with wave after wave, wouldn't he be pestered to death?</p><p></p><p>With that thought, Hunhui's burly figure flashed and transformed into a beam of red light, soaring towards the dark sky above, soon disappearing from sight.</p><p></p><p>.........</p><p></p><p>The earth-shattering event that occurred outside the human realm quickly spread throughout the entire Shenmo Battlefield. </p><p></p><p>There was no way to keep it a secret.</p><p></p><p>Even if Biqiong Aoxing and the others wanted to avoid mentioning it, it would be useless.</p><p></p><p>When the details were known, all the tribes fell silent, even the top hundred clans briefly fell silent.</p><p></p><p>The human tribe possessed one million six hundred and sixty-six Liuli Hearts...</p><p></p><p>The powerful experts of the other tribes who went there... were almost completely wiped out!</p><p></p><p>The Third Divine Official of the Shenshen Tribe perished!</p><p></p><p>The Divine Sons and Daughters as well as the important elders of the peak great clans like the Shenzuo Clan were all captured!!</p><p></p><p>And the instigator of all this, the human in blue, Lu Nan!</p><p></p><p>After learning all the details, this person's danger level instantly skyrocketed to the top of the Shenmo Battlefield!</p><p></p><p>Another sword cultivator!</p><p></p><p>His sword dao was terrifyingly powerful, unheard of, far surpassing even the Sword Immortal Sword Wuwei!</p><p></p><p>Although this person had great enmity with the myriad tribes, the myriad tribes had also given him the title of Azure Robe Sword Immortal!</p><p></p><p>Regardless, as long as one was a powerful expert in the Shenmo Battlefield, they would have a title.</p><p></p><p>What surprised everyone next was that the myriad tribes did not immediately take action, but remained silent for three months.</p><p></p><p>Of course, three months was a relatively short time for cultivators, not much different from three days.</p><p></p><p>The Shenmo Battlefield had become completely quiet, like the calm before the storm!</p><p></p><p>.........</p><p></p><p>At the same time, a middle-aged man with a burly figure, a single horn on his forehead, and fiery red hair, his black robe wrapped around him like a demonic lord, appeared in the war mist of the Shenmo Battlefield!</p><p></p><p>"Human Lu Nan? Not bad, you do have some abilities! But the chaos you've caused to the order of my Soul Realm cannot be simply brushed aside!"</p><p></p><p>Hunhui's eyes grew fierce. Although he generally could not interfere too much in the outside world, especially in matters of life and death, he could still give a lesson, beat him half to death should be no problem!</p><p></p><p>Hmph!</p><p></p><p>After a cold snort, Hunhui strode into the mist towards the human realm, his burly figure soon disappearing from sight.</p>

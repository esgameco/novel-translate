        <h1>Chapter 7</h1>
        <div class="content">
            <p>Here is the full English translation of the excerpt from the Chinese novel:</p><p></p><p>The Imperial Palace of the Lishui Empire.üî•üçÆ‚ùªÔºô·îï–Ωùìæùêó.Âåö·ªñùê¶üí•üíö</p><p></p><p>This was the time for court proceedings.</p><p></p><p>The Lishui Grand Hall was in a great commotion, lacking the solemn atmosphere of the past!</p><p></p><p>"In the past, demonic creatures mostly appeared alone, but this time there are not just one, and they are coming in droves. Some towns have already seen many of their people suffer."</p><p></p><p>"Many of the common people have gone from hopeful to lamenting in anguish."</p><p></p><p>"Yes, if this continues, the Lishui Empire will surely be devastated."</p><p></p><p>"......"</p><p></p><p>At this moment, the first elder on the left discreetly glanced at the gloomy-faced king on the high seat, then stood up and spoke loudly:</p><p></p><p>"Silence! What kind of decorum is this commotion in the Lishui Grand Hall? Who doesn't know what you all have said? Now everyone should be thinking of strategies, with helping the king resolve his worries as the top priority!"</p><p></p><p>As the words fell, the Lishui Grand Hall suddenly fell silent.</p><p></p><p>Seeing this, the expression on the face of the Lishui king on the high seat slightly relaxed, and he looked at the elder with satisfaction, then spoke in a calm voice,</p><p></p><p>"All my ministers can come forward and share your thoughts, but it must be orderly, not chaotic."</p><p></p><p>The people looked at each other, and finally a middle-aged official stood up and bowed, saying, "Your Majesty, as for the demonic creatures, we mortals are naturally powerless... This matter, just like before, still requires... the intervention of the immortals."</p><p></p><p>Hearing the title of "immortals", the people were all startled.</p><p></p><p>The common people may not know that there are immortals in the world, but all those who can come to the court know of the existence of immortals!</p><p></p><p>At the same time, the immortals have warned that their existence must not be made public to the secular world.</p><p></p><p>The people remembered this well, and treated it as a secret.</p><p></p><p>In the past, whenever there were demonic troubles, it was basically the immortals who handled them, after all, they paid tribute every year, and it was only natural for the immortals to protect the region.</p><p></p><p>It's just that this time, the immortals have been slow to come, and they are somewhat panicked.</p><p></p><p>Seeing the hopeful gaze of the officials, the Lishui king shook his head and sighed, "When the demonic trouble first started, the king had already sent people on fast horses to the Qingyun Sect to request the immortals to come out of seclusion, but until now, there has been no news..."</p><p></p><p>Hearing this, the officials all deflated, their faces gradually turning pale.</p><p></p><p>If this continues, their lives will also be in danger.</p><p></p><p>"Until now, how many casualties have there been in those affected towns?" the Lishui king asked solemnly.</p><p></p><p>"Your Majesty, in Jia'yuan City, about 200 have perished, in Pingyang City, about 300 have perished, in L√ºliuzhen, about 110 have perished... And there are many other small villages that have not yet been accounted for due to their remote locations... And the death toll is still rising!" the middle-aged official reported with a pale face.</p><p></p><p>"So more than 600 have already died..." The Lishui king's pupils contracted, and this was only what could be accounted for...</p><p></p><p>"What about the injured? Didn't I order a report on both the dead and injured?"</p><p></p><p>The Lishui king's expression was furious!</p><p></p><p>The middle-aged official trembled and knelt on the ground, saying mournfully, "Your Majesty, there are no injured, for all who encounter the demonic creatures are doomed to die!"</p><p></p><p>The Lishui king's angry expression froze, and for a moment he did not know what to say.</p><p></p><p>"Your Majesty! The town leaders of those afflicted towns are barely able to calm the restless and panicked commoners! They may revolt at any moment! Please, Your Majesty, devise a strategy!" </p><p></p><p>The middle-aged official said solemnly.</p><p></p><p>Hearing this, the other officials also hurriedly knelt down, shouting, "Please, Your Majesty, devise a strategy!"</p><p></p><p>The shout was deafening, and the Lishui king paused for a moment, then suddenly rose to his feet, his face turning iron-blue as he roared, "That is the work of demonic creatures! How can I, a mere mortal, have any strategy? And what about you? Have you all become useless hangers-on? In the past times of peace, each of you thought you were capable! Now have you all wilted?"</p><p></p><p>Facing the furious outburst of the king, the officials trembled and dared not speak.</p><p></p><p>Just as the atmosphere became increasingly oppressive,</p><p></p><p>the sound of hurried footsteps arose, and the people saw a commander leading eleven young men and women entering the hall...</p><p></p><p>Except for the elegantly dressed young leader, the others were all dressed in uniform dark green attire, each with a haughty bearing, their chins raised as if they were reaching for the sky.</p><p></p><p>This group was the disciples of the outer sect of Qingyun Sect.</p><p></p><p>"Your Majesty, your servant has not failed the mission!" </p><p></p><p>The commander bowed to the dazed Lishui king.</p><p></p><p>Here is the full English translation of the Chinese excerpt:</p><p></p><p>The Water Kingdom King at this moment had no more heart to praise this general. He ran down the high platform in three steps and two steps, coming before Tong Xin and the others, and respectfully said in great excitement, "The immortal sages have finally arrived! We are saved, my Water Empire is finally saved!"</p><p></p><p>The officials had previously guessed that these young men and women were immortals based on the general's words and their aura. After seeing the king's respectful attitude and words, their eyes lit up and their faces were filled with awe and excitement!</p><p></p><p>Immortals, they are truly immortals!</p><p></p><p>Tong Xin waved his hand and said indifferently to the Water Kingdom King, "Enough nonsense, let's get straight to the main issue. On our way here, we did not discover any demons harassing the towns along the way. Why is that?"</p><p></p><p>Regarding the attitude of the young man in elegant attire, the Water Kingdom King had not the slightest dissatisfaction, nor dared he to have any. He immediately responded respectfully, "Immortal sages may not know, but the towns currently plagued by demons are all located in the eastern region of my Water Empire. I presume you immortal sages have come from one of the other three directions..."</p><p></p><p>I see.</p><p></p><p>Tong Xin and his ten disciples nodded slightly.</p><p></p><p>"Approximately how many demons are there? And what are their physical characteristics?"</p><p></p><p>Tong Xin narrowed his eyes and asked, trying to obtain some useful information.</p><p></p><p>The Water Kingdom King's face paled, and he trembled as he said, "I, I don't know."</p><p></p><p>"Then how did the unfortunate civilians who were killed die?" Tong Xin asked again.</p><p></p><p>The Water Kingdom King's face changed again. The information he knew was extremely limited, one could even say he basically knew nothing. He replied with difficulty, "I only know that the bodies of the killed civilians were like dried corpses, as for the rest... I don't know..."</p><p></p><p>Dried corpses? Tong Xin frowned slightly.</p><p></p><p>"You don't even know some basic information, what have you all been doing?!"</p><p></p><p>Before Tong Xin could speak, one male disciple couldn't help but step forward and shout in a low voice, intentionally mixing spiritual energy into his voice, causing the crowd's heads to feel a bit dizzy.</p><p></p><p>"Immortal sage, please do not be angry! It's just that all those who have encountered the demons have died, with no survivors! We... are just ordinary people, after all."</p><p></p><p>The Water Kingdom King was frightened and deeply bowed, speaking with some sadness.</p><p></p><p>"You...!" The male disciple glared, about to continue saying something.</p><p></p><p>But he was interrupted by Tong Xin's indifferent face raising his hand: "Enough."</p><p></p><p>"Senior Brother Tong...!" </p><p></p><p>"Withdraw!" Tong Xin lightly commanded.</p><p></p><p>"Yes, yes." The male disciple's face turned deathly pale, and he retreated, looking at Tong Xin with the same awe as the other disciples.</p><p></p><p>Senior Brother Tong usually seemed quite amiable, but who knew he could be so terrifying when angered.</p><p></p><p>Although Senior Brother Tong was younger than them, his talent and status were far above theirs. He was the direct disciple of the Ancient Elder, his status was vastly different from theirs, like heaven and earth.</p><p></p><p>Sensing the fear and trepidation of the young men and women, the crowd finally realized how high the status of their leader, the young immortal, was.</p><p></p><p>An unusual silence fell, with all eyes focused on Tong Xin.</p><p></p><p>"Im-Immortal sage..." The Water Kingdom King couldn't help but break the silence, wanting to say something.</p><p></p><p>"You don't need to say anything more. Just tell us the specific locations of the towns plagued by the demons. As for the rest, you can rest assured, our Qingyun Sect collects your tributes from the Water Empire every year, so we will naturally protect you all!" </p><p></p><p>Tong Xin looked at the Water Kingdom King and said in a calm voice.</p><p></p><p>"Thank you, immortal sage!"</p><p></p><p>The Water Kingdom King and the officials were relieved in their hearts, and were also moved. They unanimously performed a grand salute towards Tong Xin and the others.</p><p></p><p>Although Tong Xin's expression remained cold and aloof, his heart was filled with immense pride!</p><p></p><p>Tsk tsk, being in a high worldly position is really great. This feeling of being worshipped by all is simply wonderful, not an exaggeration at all. Especially being addressed as "immortal sage" at every turn, it's simply too gratifying.</p><p></p><p>However, to be honest, his disciples are still just novices in the cultivation world!</p><p></p><p>Even the dominant figures in the cultivation world would not dare to call themselves immortal sages, right? </p><p></p><p>What does an immortal sage represent? It represents eternal life!!!</p><p></p><p>Where in the world are there true immortal sages?...</p><p></p><p>Cough, never mind that. As for those little demons, hehe, with Tong Xin here, they are nothing to be feared!</p>

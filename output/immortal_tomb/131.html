        <h1>Chapter 131</h1>
        <div class="content">
            <p>Here is the full English translation of the Chinese excerpt:</p><p></p><p>The Celestial Realm.°°°·.°·..·°¯°·._.· ➅９𝓼ｈᵘ᙭.ςⓞⓜ ·._.·°¯°·.·° .·°°°</p><p></p><p>All the strange phenomena had disappeared.</p><p></p><p>The apocalyptic scene just now seemed like an illusion.</p><p></p><p>But everyone knew that it had truly happened, something they had witnessed with their own eyes.</p><p></p><p>The Immortal Emperor Luchengsheng had destroyed the terrifying Yumeng Demonic Clan with a single punch...</p><p></p><p>The place was silent and still, and everyone was staring at Luchengsheng.</p><p></p><p>Hunhui regained his senses and came before Luchengsheng, respectfully looking at him and saying, "Immortal Emperor Luchengsheng, now that the matter is resolved, Hunhui shall take his leave."</p><p></p><p>Luchengsheng smiled faintly, "I've troubled you."</p><p></p><p>The hooded Hunhui shook his head and smiled, "Not at all, Immortal Emperor Luchengsheng. Hunhui has not been of much help. Farewell."</p><p></p><p>With that, he bowed and disappeared from the scene.</p><p></p><p>At this moment, Guyinyang stumbled, and Shiwushi quickly supported him. "Yinyang, what's wrong with you!"</p><p></p><p>"Yinyang Emperor!"</p><p></p><p>The assembled Immortal Exalted Ones and Immortal Kings also looked at Guyinyang with concern.</p><p></p><p>"He has little time left, only a few months," Luchengsheng said indifferently.</p><p></p><p>What?! Only a few months?!</p><p></p><p>The crowd was shocked, recalling the scene of him burning his lifespan, and their gazes trembled as they looked at Guyinyang.</p><p></p><p>The powerful cultivators of the Southern Immortal Realm and countless disciples from the Sand City all knelt down, their expressions filled with sorrow.</p><p></p><p>Guyinyang, however, smiled calmly, his eyes serene. He looked at Luchengsheng and said,</p><p></p><p>"Immortal Emperor Luchengsheng, since the path to the divine is difficult, it doesn't matter if Yinyang dies. But when I pass away, the Southern Immortal Realm will have no one capable of ascending to the Immortal Emperor realm in the short term. Without the support of an Immortal Emperor's power, the Southern Immortal Realm may collapse... I hope that when that time comes, Immortal Emperor Luchengsheng will..."</p><p></p><p>Towards the end, Guyinyang's tone was filled with pleading, and his meaning was clear.</p><p></p><p>He knew that Luchengsheng's strength was eerily formidable, and he hoped that when the time came, Luchengsheng would lend a hand to assist the Southern Immortal Realm!</p><p></p><p>If his death were to plunge the countless lives in the Southern Immortal Realm into dire straits, he would not be able to rest in peace!</p><p></p><p>Hearing this, the crowd was even more shocked, their faces paling. They never imagined the situation to be this grave!</p><p></p><p>"Immortal Emperor Luchengsheng..."</p><p></p><p>Shiwushi and Nanggongjing also bowed and looked at Luchengsheng with earnest expressions.</p><p></p><p>Luchengsheng waved his hand slightly and said to Shiwushi, "I need to go to the Eastern Immortal Realm to deal with the Yumeng Demonic Clan first. We'll discuss this matter later."</p><p></p><p>Guyinyang was a little anxious, as a few months was truly too short a time for him. It would be the blink of an eye.</p><p></p><p>"Rest assured, with me here, you'll have a hard time dying," Luchengsheng said, looking at him.</p><p></p><p>Then he continued, "Oh, and when I return from the Eastern Immortal Realm, you'll need to give me an account of the matter regarding the Inspection Pavilion."</p><p></p><p>Finally, he swept his gaze across the crowd and stepped out, disappearing.</p><p></p><p>"Wushi, what did Immortal Emperor Luchengsheng just say?" Guyinyang murmured.</p><p></p><p>Shiwushi snapped out of his daze, exclaiming excitedly, "Immortal Emperor Luchengsheng said that you'll have a hard time dying, implying that he may have a way to save you!"</p><p></p><p>"No, not that part, the other one," Guyinyang said, dazed.</p><p></p><p>Shiwushi cleared his throat and said, "Immortal Emperor Luchengsheng said that you need to give him an account of the matter regarding the Inspection Pavilion."</p><p></p><p>Guyinyang's face paled slightly, and he glanced at the strange expressions of the crowd. He sighed inwardly, 'It couldn't be, it couldn't be. How could Immortal Emperor Luchengsheng publicly mention this matter? He really didn't give me any face at all.'</p><p></p><p>The expressions of Li Hua and the others behind him were even more terrified, paler than when they had faced the Yumeng Demonic Clan.</p><p></p><p>So the one who had destroyed the Inspection Pavilion was actually the great Immortal Emperor Luchengsheng?</p><p></p><p>This...</p><p></p><p>.........</p><p></p><p>In the Eastern Immortal Realm, the situation was far less dire than in the Southern Immortal Realm.</p><p></p><p>The Yumeng Demonic Clan had not yet invaded.</p><p></p><p>New 𝟲𝟵</p><p></p><p>Here is the full English translation of the Chinese excerpt:</p><p></p><p>It's not because of anything else, but the old turtle's defense is incredibly tough!!</p><p></p><p>The attacks from the Underworld Demon Clan are difficult to break through for the time being.</p><p></p><p>"You bastard, come out and fight, don't be a cowardly turtle!!" </p><p></p><p>Outside the dimensional barrier, the Underworld King roared angrily.</p><p></p><p>The old turtle, with his hand forming a seal, coldly laughed: "You still want Grandpa Turtle to fight with you? Dream on, if you have the ability, then break through the defense, otherwise, wait until my master arrives, and you'll all die!"</p><p></p><p>He's not stupid, to fight would be futile, given their lineup, even if he could hold off five, the other five peak experts like Chu Lingian would still be powerless.</p><p></p><p>"You! Haha, what can Luchengsheng do even if he comes? You should be more worried about the Southern Immortal Realm now! The defenses there are relatively weak, I bet our Underworld Demon Clan's main force has already invaded and is carrying out a great massacre right now, haha!"</p><p></p><p>The Underworld Demon Clan paused for a moment, then sneered.</p><p></p><p>Hearing this, the old turtle and the others' expressions darkened, this is also what they were worried about, the Southern Immortal Realm might have already fallen at this point.</p><p></p><p>The Eastern Immortal Realm is currently only barely holding on with his defense, but it's not a long-term solution.</p><p></p><p>"Old Turtle... we..." </p><p></p><p>Chu Lingian and Phoenix Nine hesitated.</p><p></p><p>Seeing this, the old turtle frowned and said, "I know what you're thinking, you won't make it in time to the Southern Immortal Realm, it will only increase casualties, it's better to stay and defend this place with me! I can't hold on forever, I'm just trying to buy time as much as possible, hoping the master will arrive soon."</p><p></p><p>Chu Lingian and Phoenix Nine fell silent, their brows tightly furrowed, they were deeply worried.</p><p></p><p>Boom! Boom! Boom! Boom!</p><p></p><p>The Underworld Demon Clan outside kept bombarding the old turtle's defense, as if they would never tire.</p><p></p><p>But anyone with eyes could see that as time passed, the old turtle's defense was starting to loosen.</p><p></p><p>After all, he had been holding out for so long, even if the defense was solid, the consumption would eventually continue.</p><p></p><p>"Everyone, get ready, my consumption is quite large, we may have to go to war."</p><p></p><p>The old turtle frowned and warned.</p><p></p><p>Hearing this, Chu Lingian, Phoenix Nine, the Immortal Sovereign, and the Demon Tiger Emperor's eyes narrowed as they silently activated their immortal spiritual power.</p><p></p><p>It seems that this battle today is inevitable!</p><p></p><p>"Haha, old turtle, your consumption is heavy, right? Can't hold on much longer, huh? I know your defense is amazing, but so what?"</p><p></p><p>"Hmph..."</p><p></p><p>The Underworld Kings outside sneered with disdain.</p><p></p><p>Just then,</p><p></p><p>the Immortal Emperor Token in the old turtle's embrace suddenly started to tremble, heating up and emitting a brilliant glow!!</p><p></p><p>The old turtle was startled, then reacted with delight.</p><p></p><p>The next moment, the Immortal Emperor Token flew out from his embrace, floating in the air in the bewildered gaze of everyone, trembling and the glow becoming more and more dazzling, even in broad daylight, it shone brilliantly!</p><p></p><p>Everyone clearly felt the joy and excitement of the Immortal Emperor Token!</p><p></p><p>And the owner of this Immortal Emperor Token, everyone was shocked!!</p><p></p><p>Could it be the Immortal Emperor Luchengsheng?</p><p></p><p>"Master! Is that you who has arrived? Master, please come out quickly, the old turtle is running low on power, can't hold on much longer!" </p><p></p><p>The old turtle cried out to the sky excitedly.</p><p></p><p>While below, Tiger Battle's body trembled, his eyes flashing with intense fear!!!</p><p></p><p>He frowned deeply, took a deep breath, and stepped back behind the others, hiding himself in self-deception.</p><p></p><p>Hearing the old turtle's cry, the Underworld Kings' hearts tightened, they temporarily stopped their attack, their gazes wary as they scanned the surroundings.</p><p></p><p>Could it be that Luchengsheng really has arrived?</p><p></p><p>Just then,</p><p></p><p>a young man in blue robes appeared out of thin air, taking the Immortal Emperor Token in his hand and holding it behind his back.</p><p></p><p>He descended in front of the stunned Chu Lingian and the others, smiling faintly and saying,</p><p></p><p>"It's been a while."</p>

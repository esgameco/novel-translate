        <div class="content">
            <p>Here is the full English translation of the Chinese excerpt:</p><p></p><p>Soon, </p><p></p><p>two middle-aged men in elegant attire entered the hall. When the elders saw them, they hurriedly bowed slightly to show their respect.</p><p></p><p>"Haha, Clan Leader Huang Zhong, Clan Leader Chen He, what brings you to our Chu Clan Immortal Tribe today?" </p><p></p><p>Chu Lang's eyes flashed as he smiled and went to greet them.</p><p></p><p>"Enough, Chu Lang, you and Chen He both know why we have come, so let's skip the polite talk," sighed Huang Zhong.</p><p></p><p>Chen He, standing beside him, pursed his lips, his expression cold and serious.</p><p></p><p>Chu Lang's smile quickly faded at these words. He gestured to the seats at the side and said, "Please, clan leaders, have a seat."</p><p></p><p>Huang Zhong and Chen He nodded and went to sit down.</p><p></p><p>The atmosphere in the hall was heavy and somber for a long while.</p><p></p><p>Finally, Chen He spoke first. "Chu Lang, in three days the Inspection Commissioner will come to the Sand City to hold us three immortal clans accountable for the destruction of the Eternal Sect. What are your thoughts on this?"</p><p></p><p>Chu Lang looked between the two of them and pondered, "You and Huang Zhong have come together, so I assume you've already discussed this on the way. Perhaps you've already reached a consensus. Why don't you share your thoughts first?"</p><p></p><p>Hearing this, the elders perked up their ears, prepared to listen attentively.</p><p></p><p>"Very well, then I'll be direct. After discussing with Chen He, we have decided that if the Inspection Commissioner shamelessly tries to blame and punish our three great immortal clans in three days' time...we will fight back! We will not just sit and accept our fate!" Huang Zhong's face darkened with killing intent as he spoke coldly.</p><p></p><p>"Correct, those people are just small fry dispatched by the Inspection Hall. If the three of us join forces, we may even have a chance of winning," Chen He hesitated briefly before continuing, "And even if we don't win, so be it. But if we do manage to prevail by some stroke of luck, we'll kill them all and simply leave the Langtiandomain."</p><p></p><p>Chen He's words echoed through the hall, while Chu Lang and the elders had turned grave and fallen silent.</p><p></p><p>Kill the Inspection Commissioner!</p><p></p><p>"What you say makes sense...but have you considered that even if we somehow manage to kill the Inspection Commissioner, we'll likely spend the rest of our lives being hunted down by the Inspection Hall?" Chu Lang said in a low voice.</p><p></p><p>Huang Zhong angrily flung his sleeve and shouted, "So be it, let them hunt us! Better to die later than die now. We have to take a gamble, as I, the clan leader, don't want to die a meaningless death!"</p><p></p><p>Chen He nodded solemnly, "Yes, and the Fuyao Immortal Realm is so vast, I refuse to believe we three clans can't find a place to hide. Even if the Inspection Hall has unparalleled power, it won't be easy for them to track us down."</p><p></p><p>Chu Lang's expression was grave. As the clan leader of the Chu Immortal Tribe, he was no coward either. He soon declared, "Alright! Since you two have decided, I, Chu Lang, am no shrinking violet either! Then...let's do it!"</p><p></p><p>Huang Zhong and Chen He's expressions relaxed, and they stood up.</p><p></p><p>Chen He looked at Huang Zhong and Chu Lang, chuckling wistfully, "We three have been old friends. In the past in this Langtian Domain, our three clans competed fiercely, but who would have thought we'd one day join forces for the sake of life and death."</p><p></p><p>Chu Lang and Huang Zhong also revealed faint smiles on their faces.</p><p></p><p>Facing life and death, one may feel fear, panic, and their thoughts may waver like drifting duckweed. </p><p></p><p>But once a decision is made and the heart is hardened, they no longer hesitate and become utterly resolute.</p><p></p><p>"Good, then it's settled. In three days, we'll head to...the Sand City!"</p><p></p><p>.........</p><p></p><p>"Miss, what did the clan leader say?" Zhang Youdao asked anxiously as Chu Xiruo returned to the courtyard.</p><p></p><p>"Nothing much," Chu Xiruo replied indifferently as she sat down at the stone table.</p><p></p><p>Here is the full English translation of the excerpt from the Chinese novel:</p><p></p><p>He let out a light sigh.</p><p></p><p>Zhang Youdao pursed his lips, his expression somewhat heavy.</p><p></p><p>He had joined the Chu Clan Immortal Tribe for twelve years now and had gained some understanding of the Immortal Realm.</p><p></p><p>The Immortal Realm also has ordinary people.</p><p></p><p>And apart from the cultivators who ascended from various realms, the native cultivators of the Immortal Realm also cultivated step by step from the Refining Qi stage, so in the Immortal Realm, apart from mortals, cultivators below the Tribulation Crossing stage still make up the majority.</p><p></p><p>Just like this Chu Clan Immortal Tribe, his Earthly Immortal Realm is not at the bottom, there are still Tribulation Crossing, Divine Transformation, Nascent Soul, and so on below.</p><p></p><p>The upper limit of the Immortal Realm is extremely high, after Tribulation Crossing, there are Earthly Immortals, Celestial Immortals, Golden Immortals, Great Dao Golden Immortals, Primal Chaos Immortal Lords, Immortal Kings, Immortal Venerable, Immortal Emperors...</p><p></p><p>There is a saying in the Immortal Realm: Below the Great Dao, all are inferior!</p><p></p><p>At least in the current Lang Tian Domain, there is not even a single Great Dao Golden Immortal! Even Golden Immortals are extremely rare.</p><p></p><p>Zhang Youdao is currently only a First-Grade Earthly Immortal, the Great Dao Golden Immortal realm is still far away for him, he doesn't know if he will have the chance to advance in this lifetime. And the realms and titles that are even more terrifying than the Great Dao make his scalp tingle.</p><p></p><p>He has finally figured out that the person who destroyed the Azure Robe Senior of the Tian Heng Sect with a palm strike twelve years ago was actually... the Immortal Emperor of Longevity in the Central Immortal Realm!!</p><p></p><p>Whenever Zhang Youdao thinks about it, he still feels a chill down his spine and his soul trembles.</p><p></p><p>That was the person who stood at the pinnacle of the Immortal Realm and established the rules of the Immortal Realm...</p><p></p><p>His heart is filled with immense trepidation and honor, that he had actually seen the Immortal Emperor.</p><p></p><p>Thinking about it now, the Azure Robe Senior of the past was truly a towering giant tree, standing tall before him, an insignificant ant.</p><p></p><p>And he was also quite approachable.</p><p></p><p>Perhaps if he didn't know the identity beforehand, he would have thought Lu Changsheng was aloof, but after knowing his identity, in association with his status, he instantly felt that Lu Changsheng was very amiable.</p><p></p><p>"Youdao, the Chu Clan Immortal Tribe is in a difficult situation now, and in three days, the outcome will be uncertain. If you wish to leave, you may do so."</p><p></p><p>At this time, Chu Xiruo spoke.</p><p></p><p>Zhang Youdao did not hesitate, and smiled as he said, "Miss, you are overstating it. No matter what, the Chu Clan Immortal Tribe has nurtured me for twelve years, and I will not abandon the Clan in this kind of situation."</p><p></p><p>He and Chu Xiruo both knew how the Tian Heng Sect was destroyed twelve years ago, but they could not possibly talk about it.</p><p></p><p>The affairs of the Immortal Emperor, that supreme existence, are not something that insignificant ants like them can comment on behind the scenes.</p><p></p><p>A look of relief appeared on Chu Xiruo's face, and she also smiled as she said, "Do you know why I had you join our Chu Clan Immortal Tribe twelve years ago?"</p><p></p><p>Zhang Youdao: "Miss did not trust me..."</p><p></p><p>Halfway through, Zhang Youdao discreetly pointed to the sky...</p><p></p><p>Chu Xiruo, seeing that Zhang Youdao understood, was not surprised. After all, it has been twelve years, and he is not a fool.</p><p></p><p>She then said, "It's not that I didn't trust you, but with your current understanding of the Immortal Realm, you should know how big of a deal this matter is."</p><p></p><p>Zhang Youdao's body trembled, and he nodded his head, only after a long while did the agitation in his chest subside.</p><p></p><p>In fact, there was no need, he was really too afraid to recall the person and events of Lu Changsheng, for some reason, there was a nameless great terror towards him.</p><p></p><p>Chu Xiruo also took a deep breath, shook her head, and then said in a solemn voice, "You don't need to worry, in three days, if the Inspection Commissioner forcibly condemns our three clans, I believe the three clans will not just sit and wait to die!"</p><p></p><p>Hearing this, Zhang Youdao clenched his fist tightly.</p>

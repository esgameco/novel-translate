        <h1>Chapter 421</h1>
        <div class="content">
            <p>Here is the full English translation of the excerpt from the Chinese novel:</p><p></p><p>The Yooting Lake was deathly silent.</p><p></p><p>Everyone stared blankly at Cloud Ao Xie and Ye Xun Wang kneeling there.</p><p></p><p>Despite the scorching sun, the crowd felt as if they had been plunged into the depths of a freezing winter, their bodies shivering as if trapped in an icy cellar.</p><p></p><p>This reversal was too sudden, and no one could react in time.</p><p></p><p>Cloud Ao Xie's four subordinates were also stunned by this sudden scene, but after regaining their senses, they quickly knelt down as well!</p><p></p><p>Guo Xiong, the estate manager, and Zhu Gu Yuan and the others were shivering, their throats constricted, especially Guo Xiong and the estate manager, their faces deathly pale without a trace of blood!</p><p></p><p>Boom, boom, boom, boom, boom...</p><p></p><p>Suddenly, the sound of countless people kneeling resounded, as all the citizens of Yooting Lake dropped to their knees in a grand, sweeping motion!</p><p></p><p>There was no other reason - it was simply because the Ninth Prince and the Peerless Musician had knelt, and they all dared not stand!</p><p></p><p>Seeing this scene, Zhu Qingqing's gaze became hazy and trembling, her heart surging with waves of emotion!</p><p></p><p>The Peerless Musician, he...</p><p></p><p>Cloud Ao Xie, seeing the courtyard so quiet, grew increasingly fearful. He glanced sideways at Ye Xun Wang beside him, knowing that Ye Xun Wang could not help him either. He then raised the thorns on his head again and cried out in a trembling voice:</p><p></p><p>"Yesterday, it was Ao Xie... reckless, short-sighted, failing to recognize the true dragon. If the Esteemed One can forgive his anger, Ao Xie... would not mind dying!!"</p><p></p><p>The crowd, kneeling on the ground, heard Cloud Ao Xie's words again, sensing the fear in his tone, and felt a chill run down their spines.</p><p></p><p>The Peerless Musician... just what kind of extraordinary being was he!</p><p></p><p>The mighty Ninth Prince of the Cloud Lian Ancient Kingdom, the most beloved by the king, was actually willing to atone with his life!!</p><p></p><p>Thinking about it deeply filled them with dread, profound dread!</p><p></p><p>"Creak~"</p><p></p><p>Just as the crowd was shuddering at the thought, the courtyard gate opened.</p><p></p><p>Lu Changsheng slowly walked out, his hands clasped behind his back, with Old Turtle following closely behind and bowing.</p><p></p><p>Sensing the movement, everyone in the area trembled!</p><p></p><p>They all knew it must be the Peerless Musician coming out, but no one dared to look up!</p><p></p><p>Only Cloud Ao Xie, still holding the thorns high, stared at the young man in blue with narrowed pupils.</p><p></p><p>Cloud Ao Xie had expected the extraordinary person Ye Xun Wang spoke of to be a venerable elder with an immortal demeanor, but he never imagined it would be such a refined and handsome young man.</p><p></p><p>Although... Cloud Ao Xie also knew that one could not judge a person's depth by their appearance alone.</p><p></p><p>Cloud Ao Xie merely glanced at him and then lowered his head, not daring to look again.</p><p></p><p>At this time, Zhu Qingqing, who was kneeling in the closest position to Lu Changsheng, felt her heart racing with great nervousness and awe.</p><p></p><p>If she had initially harbored some romantic fantasies about the Peerless Musician, then from the moment the Ninth Prince begged for forgiveness, she no longer dared to indulge in such foolish dreams.</p><p></p><p>Between her and the Peerless Musician, there was an insurmountable chasm!</p><p></p><p>If the Ninth Prince Cloud Ao Xie was the moon in the sky, then she, Zhu Qingqing, was but a firefly on the ground.</p><p></p><p>Then, how could she, Zhu Qingqing, be compared to the Peerless Musician... perhaps she was not even worthy of being called dust...</p><p></p><p>"Esteemed One, Ao Xie was blind and ignorant, deserving of the gravest punishment..." Cloud Ao Xie said hoarsely, his hands holding the thorns trembling rapidly.</p><p></p><p>Lu Changsheng's gaze swept over the countless citizens of Yooting Lake kneeling before him, and after a moment, he softly said, "Forgiven."</p><p></p><p>Instantly, an irresistible aura of gentleness enveloped the tearful Cloud Ao Xie, Ye Xun Wang, and the entire crowd of Yooting Lake.</p><p></p><p>Only Guo Xiong and the estate manager remained kneeling.</p><p></p><p>After their initial bewilderment, Guo Xiong and the estate manager seemed to realize something, and their faces suddenly turned deathly pale, quickly shivering and drenched in cold sweat!</p><p></p><p>"Esteemed One's magnanimity, Ao Xie is deeply grateful for Your forgiveness of Ao Xie's reckless ignorance!" Cloud Ao Xie, though spared from death, was still uneasy. He put away the thorns and bowed again, his attitude extremely respectful.</p><p></p><p>Due to standing up, Ye Xun Wang also finally got a clear look at Lu Changsheng's appearance and bearing, once again marveling in his heart.</p><p></p><p>At this moment, Lu Changsheng did not look at Cloud Ao Xie, but calmly gazed at Guo Xiong and the estate manager.</p><p></p><p>Gradually, gradually, everyone noticed this scene!</p><p></p><p>The crowd was puzzled...</p><p></p><p>Here is the full English translation of the Chinese excerpt:</p><p></p><p>Why are the City Lord and the Mansion Manager still kneeling? Didn't the Qin Immortal just tell everyone to stand up? What's going on?</p><p></p><p>Cloud Ao Xie and Ye Xun Mang keenly sensed that something was amiss, and their eyes immediately sharpened!</p><p></p><p>Could it be that the City Lord of this Tianxiang City has offended the Esteemed One?</p><p></p><p>At the same time, the two of them felt a slight joy, because if that were the case, they could take the opportunity to get closer to the Esteemed One!</p><p></p><p>Guo Xiong and the Mansion Manager, feeling the fierce gazes of Cloud Ao Xie and Ye Xun Mang, became increasingly nervous.</p><p></p><p>Especially the calm gaze of the man in the blue robe, which terrified them to the point of being completely flustered!</p><p></p><p>Guo Xiong and the Mansion Manager instantly knew that this was their life-or-death crisis!</p><p></p><p>However, Guo Xiong and the Mansion Manager simply couldn't figure out how their carefully planned and natural scheme had been detected.</p><p></p><p>Or could it be that they had misunderstood, and the man in the blue robe had them kneeling for some other reason?</p><p></p><p>After all, Guo Xiong was the City Lord of Tianxiang City, and he had brought the Ninth Prince and the Qin Saint, which had indeed disturbed this Esteemed One.</p><p></p><p>"You two scumbags, did you offend the Esteemed One?!" </p><p></p><p>Cloud Ao Xie, eager to make a good impression on Lu Changsheng, couldn't help but angrily shout.</p><p></p><p>Guo Xiong and the Mansion Manager kowtowed to the ground in fear:</p><p></p><p>"Your Highness the Ninth Prince, we truly had not met the Qin Immortal before today! How could we have offended the Qin Immortal, and how dare we..."</p><p></p><p>The city residents watched Guo Xiong dumbfoundedly. The once highly respected City Lord was now groveling like a dog...</p><p></p><p>However, the residents were not too shocked, as even the Ninth Prince and the Qin Saint had been terrified earlier, so the City Lord was nothing in comparison.</p><p></p><p>"Impossible, you must have offended him! Tell me, how do you want to die?!"</p><p></p><p>Cloud Ao Xie said in a gloomy voice.</p><p></p><p>In this situation, it didn't matter whether Guo Xiong and the Mansion Manager had actually offended this Esteemed One or not.</p><p></p><p>The fact was that this Esteemed One seemed displeased with them.</p><p></p><p>Since the Esteemed One was displeased, there was nothing else to be said.</p><p></p><p>Whether they were right or wrong, they would just be condemned!</p><p></p><p>Guo Xiong and the Mansion Manager were truly terrified, feeling death looming closer than ever before.</p><p></p><p>They felt that their lives were worthless in the eyes of the Ninth Prince and the others, who were willing to sacrifice them to please this Qin Immortal.</p><p></p><p>"Qin Immortal, our hearts are as pure as the sun and moon! We have never had the intention of offending you!" </p><p></p><p>Guo Xiong said in a trembling, sorrowful voice.</p><p></p><p>"Hmph." Cloud Ao Xie sneered, then carefully looked at the inscrutable man in the blue robe: "Esteemed One, rest assured, these two insects dared to offend you, and Ao Xie will definitely punish them!"</p><p></p><p>Lu Changsheng nodded slightly, then turned and walked towards the courtyard.</p><p></p><p>"Creak."</p><p></p><p>As the old tortoise closed the courtyard gate,</p><p></p><p>Cloud Ao Xie suddenly looked at Guo Xiong and the Mansion Manager and coldly waved his hand: "Execute them on the spot!"</p><p></p><p>"Yes, sir!" </p><p></p><p>The four subordinates respectfully responded.</p><p></p><p>Guo Xiong and the Mansion Manager were struck as if by lightning, their spirits completely broken...</p><p></p><p>Afterwards, Guo Xiong and the Mansion Manager were easily eliminated by Cloud Ao Xie's subordinates.</p><p></p><p>All the city residents witnessed this scene...</p><p></p><p>The living, breathing City Lord had just died like that?</p><p></p><p>The emotions of the city residents were extremely complex and indescribable.</p><p></p><p>When a person's strength reaches a certain level, they don't even need to lift a finger to kill. </p><p></p><p>A single disapproving glance is enough to have someone eagerly step forward to please them.</p><p></p><p>And the Qin Immortal... throughout the entire process, he barely said a word, yet he had decided the life and death of the City Lord.</p><p></p><p>Guo Xiong and the Mansion Manager's previous actions were aimed at using the Ninth Prince's blade to kill Lu Changsheng.</p><p></p><p>Now, Lu Changsheng had simply retaliated in the same, more direct way.</p><p></p><p>As for this, Lu Changsheng was also happy to take it lightly.</p>

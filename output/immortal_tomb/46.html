        <h1>Chapter 46</h1>
        <div class="content">
            <p>Here is the full English translation of the Chinese excerpt:</p><p></p><p>In the town of Moyu,</p><p></p><p>Just like every other day, people were coming and going on the streets. üêçüëπ‚ûÖÔºô‡∏£–Ωùì§ùï©.ÔΩÉœÉŒúüç≠üç≠</p><p></p><p>The vendors were rubbing their hands and puffing out hot breaths, their cries echoing all around.</p><p></p><p>"Little miss, it's the dead of winter, yet you're still selling cabbage hearts? How unexpected!" </p><p></p><p>An elderly woman carrying a vegetable basket exclaimed in delight.</p><p></p><p>Xiaotong smiled and said, "Auntie, these are from the stockpile at my home. But since there are few people at home to eat them, I'm selling some to make a bit of money."</p><p></p><p>The woman placed the basket at her feet, squatting down to pick through the contents. "Wonderful, I'll take a few stalks then. I'm in luck today - I can make a cabbage heart soup when I get home. On a cold day like this, it'll be so comforting to have a warm mouthful!"</p><p></p><p>Xiaotong stood by with a smile, silently waiting as the woman made her selection.</p><p></p><p>"I'll take these few stalks then, how much do I owe you?"</p><p></p><p>The woman placed five cabbage heart stalks in her basket, asking with a smile.</p><p></p><p>Just as Xiaotong was about to speak,</p><p></p><p>The ground suddenly began to tremble!</p><p></p><p>Amid the bewildered and anxious townspeople, a shout rang out from the town walls:</p><p></p><p>"All townspeople, return home and lock your doors!! A demonic beast is coming!!"</p><p></p><p>The street descended into complete chaos then! </p><p></p><p>Fear etched on their faces, the people rushed towards their homes, the vendors hurriedly packing up their stalls.</p><p></p><p>Xiaotong was still dazed when she saw the woman grab her basket and run off.</p><p></p><p>"Fi-five copper coins..." Xiaotong murmured, reaching a hand out towards the retreating woman's back.</p><p></p><p>But soon, feeling the ground trembling even more strongly, Xiaotong's face paled. She quickly picked up her carrying pole, only to freeze again. </p><p></p><p>She didn't know where to hide - her home was near the mountains, not in this Moyu town.</p><p></p><p>Gritting her teeth, she stepped out and knocked on the door of a nearby household. "Excuse me, may I take shelter here for a while?"</p><p></p><p>But before she could finish, a voice from inside called out, "You'd better leave, we don't dare open the door right now!"</p><p></p><p>Xiaotong knocked on four or five more homes, but no one was willing to take her in.</p><p></p><p>By now, the streets were completely deserted, everyone having gone into hiding.</p><p></p><p>Helpless, she found a nook and placed her two baskets outside, curling up in the corner, muttering fearfully,</p><p></p><p>"At least I didn't bring Grandma with me today..."</p><p></p><p>Roar!</p><p></p><p>A bloodcurdling howl came from outside the town, and Xiaotong hugged her knees, shivering in terror as tears sprang to her eyes. </p><p></p><p>She was still just a child, and a delicate girl at that.</p><p></p><p>"Why aren't you selling fruit today?"</p><p></p><p>Suddenly, a warm, gentle voice spoke up.</p><p></p><p>Xiaotong started, looking up hesitantly to see a young man in green robes crouching in front of her baskets, a faint smile on his lips.</p><p></p><p>"Big... big brother."</p><p></p><p>She recognized Lu Changsheng, the one who had bought fruit from her twice before.</p><p></p><p>She then cried out in alarm, "Big brother, there are demons outside the town now, it's very dangerous out there. Shouldn't you hurry home?"</p><p></p><p>Lu Changsheng smiled calmly. "If the demons are outside the town, then what danger is there inside the town?"</p><p></p><p>"But... but..." Xiaotong stammered, her eyes red.</p><p></p><p>"And do you really think it's safer inside the town? If the demons break in, no one will be able to escape," Lu Changsheng said.</p><p></p><p>Seeing the young man's unperturbed expression, Xiaotong felt a strange sense of calm wash over her as well.</p><p></p><p>"Come." </p><p></p><p>Lu Changsheng stood up.</p><p></p><p>"Go... where?"</p><p></p><p>"It's so cold, naturally we'll go to my place for a hot cup of tea, and wait there until the demon crisis has passed."</p><p></p><p>Lu Changsheng turned and started walking away.</p><p></p><p>"Okay, thank you, big brother."</p><p></p><p>Xiaotong quietly emerged from her nook, picked up her carrying pole, and hurried to follow Lu Changsheng.</p><p></p><p>Soon, they arrived at the lord's manor. Due to the demon threat, there were no guards posted at the entrance - they had all gone to deal with the situation.</p><p></p><p>Xiaotong followed Lu Changsheng dazedly as he led the way to the back garden.</p><p></p><p>The pavilion.</p><p></p><p>"Have a seat. There's hot tea on the table, do you need me to pour it for you?"</p><p></p><p>Seeing Xiaotong's dazed expression, Lu Changsheng smiled faintly.</p><p></p><p>Xiaotong snapped out of her daze, picking up the teapot to pour a cup for Lu Changsheng and herself. </p><p></p><p>Sitting down timidly, she took a sip of the tea, then looked at Lu Changsheng with reverence. "Big... big brother, are you the lord's son?"</p><p></p><p>Given Lu Changsheng's age, she could only guess that he must be Chen Dajian's son.</p><p></p><p>Lu Changsheng was slightly taken aback.</p><p></p><p>"Pfft..."</p><p></p><p>But the old turtle perched on his shoulder couldn't hold back a laugh.</p><p></p><p>Xiaotong was startled by the laughter, only now noticing the turtle on Lu Changsheng's shoulder.</p><p></p><p>"Big brother, the... the turtle just laughed, didn't it?"</p><p></p><p>Xiaotong stared, her hand trembling.</p><p></p><p>Here is the full English translation of the Chinese excerpt:</p><p></p><p>The old turtle pointing at Lu Changsheng's shoulder said confusedly, "Oh, it seems you must be nervous and haven't recovered yet, so you misheard."</p><p></p><p>At this moment, the old turtle in Lu Changsheng's palm, after being pressed down a bit by him, saw stars spinning in front of his eyes, almost fainting in pain, and thought to himself, "Master, you're using too much force..."</p><p></p><p>"Okay, okay, then it must have been Xiao Tong who misheard," Xiao Tong said embarrassedly.</p><p></p><p>Boom! Boom! Boom!</p><p>At this time, a series of impact sounds came from the town wall.</p><p></p><p>"Brother, I don't know if the town guards can hold out. If the demonic beasts break into the city, the townspeople will surely suffer many casualties," Xiao Tong said with a trembling body and sorrow.</p><p></p><p>"You should think of yourself first. Sometimes, it's better to be a little selfish," Lu Changsheng said indifferently.</p><p></p><p>Xiao Tong fell silent, only the intermittent booming sounds from the town wall echoing, each one making her body tremble, as if they were striking her heart.</p><p></p><p>"Master, shall I let these little demonic beasts continue to make such noisy disturbances? Shall I go deal with them?" the old turtle's voice sounded in Lu Changsheng's mind, showing that he had recovered somewhat.</p><p></p><p>"No need, Ancient Crane Forest and the others will be here soon. We won't intervene," Lu Changsheng thought.</p><p></p><p>"Ancient Crane Forest? Who is Ancient Crane Forest?" the old turtle was puzzled.</p><p></p><p>"Just a cultivator in this realm," Lu Changsheng said softly.</p><p></p><p>The old turtle: "Oh, for the master to remember his name, this cultivator must have some unique qualities."</p><p></p><p>Lu Changsheng placed the old turtle back on his shoulder, too lazy to bother with him anymore. Often, this old turtle was just a chatterbox, and if you kept engaging with him, he would have an endless stream of things to say, which was quite annoying.</p><p></p><p>...</p><p></p><p>On the town wall, the trembling never stopped! The wall was sunken in, cracks spreading everywhere, and it could only hold on for a little while longer before collapsing!</p><p></p><p>The town guard commander let out a long shout, "Lord of the town! These demonic beasts have tough hides and thick flesh, arrows are useless against these beasts. We must go down, the town wall is about to collapse!!"</p><p></p><p>"Lord of the town!" The steward also hurriedly looked at Chen Dadao.</p><p></p><p>Chen Dadao remained silent, staring intently at the dozen or so demonic beasts below, extremely unwilling in his heart. If only he were a Immortal...</p><p></p><p>If only, but alas, there were no "ifs." He thought of Lu Changsheng's face and was about to muster the courage to ask for help.</p><p></p><p>Suddenly, a streak of light flashed across the sky!</p><p>They saw Ancient Crane Forest leading a group of Foundation Establishment disciples steadily land on the town wall!</p><p></p><p>"Tongxin, go slay those demonic beasts!" Ancient Crane Forest commanded in a low voice.</p><p></p><p>"Yes, Master!" Tongxin rose up on his sword.</p><p></p><p>In just a moment, he had attracted the attention of the demonic beasts.</p><p></p><p>This scene left Chen Dadao and the others dumbfounded.</p><p></p><p>"Lord Chen, we almost arrived too late. My apologies," Ancient Crane Forest said to Chen Dadao.</p><p></p><p>"Not at all, not at all! Ancient Immortal, you speak too humbly!" Chen Dadao hurriedly waved his hands.</p><p></p><p>Ancient Crane Forest smiled, looked around at everyone, then turned his head to look in the direction of the lord's manor, saying to the crowd, "You all must not blame the gentleman. The gentleman's abilities are vast, and he must have known that we from Qiyun Sect were coming, which is why he did not act. As for these minor demonic beasts, unless absolutely necessary, it would be inappropriate for the gentleman to take action, as it would be beneath his status."</p><p></p><p>Considering the situation, Ancient Crane Forest felt that if he were the mighty Transcendent Immortal, he would also be reluctant to bother with slaying a few minor demonic beasts unless absolutely necessary.</p><p></p><p>"No, no! Ancient Immortal speaks too highly, we common folk would never dare to blame the gentleman. Big Dao knows, the gentleman's not acting is proper, and his acting would also be a kindness. We have our own standards in our hearts." Chen Dadao hurriedly waved his hands.</p><p></p><p>The steward and town guard commander behind him also nodded repeatedly.</p><p></p><p>"Haha, that's good then. Now, you all just watch. With Ancient One's personal involvement, these ordinary demonic beasts can be slain in the blink of an eye," Ancient Crane Forest stood on the town wall, smiling faintly.</p><p></p><p>Such a small matter, he naturally had no need to get involved.</p><p></p><p>"Yes." Everyone nodded, following Ancient Crane Forest to watch the battle, their eyes widening one by one, occasionally exclaiming in amazement.</p><p></p><p>These demonic beasts that had filled them with despair were sliced away like scallions under that young Immortal's hand, whoosh whoosh whoosh, they were gone.</p><p></p><p>...</p><p></p><p>In the pavilion, the old turtle's mocking voice sounded in Lu Changsheng's mind, "Haha, this Ancient Crane Forest is indeed intelligent, what he said makes sense. If not absolutely necessary, even a Foundation Establishment cultivator wouldn't want to bother killing a few minor demonic beasts, let alone a Transcendent Immortal like you, my lord."</p><p></p><p>"Then why were you so eager?" Lu Changsheng thought indifferently.</p><p></p><p>"Cough, the old turtle naturally wouldn't deign to deal with a few insignificant minor demonic beasts either. It's just that I wanted to make the master feel a bit more at ease, and besides..." Before the old turtle could finish, </p><p></p><p>Lu Changsheng sighed helplessly, "Alright, shut up, and don't speak for a day."</p><p></p><p>The old turtle: "..."</p>

        <h1>Chapter 297</h1>
        <div class="content">
            <p>Here is the full English translation of the excerpt from the Chinese novel:</p><p></p><p>Beyond the secret realm of the sands,</p><p></p><p>Tens of thousands of supreme celestial champions have already been eliminated, and it's been less than two days. At this rate, it's likely that the final 1,500 will be decided very soon!</p><p></p><p>Among these tens of thousands of supreme celestial champions, the vast majority are at the Immortal Ancestor realm, with only a few dozen at the Divine Source realm.</p><p></p><p>These few dozen Divine Source realm cultivators are feeling the weight of many strange gazes, their expressions gloomy.</p><p></p><p>In truth, they are the unlucky ones, having encountered supreme celestial champions at the Divine Yang realm in the secret realm. Otherwise, with their Divine Source realm cultivation, it would have been easy for them to make it to the final 1,500.</p><p></p><p>However, their unwillingness soon dissipates, as the voice transmissions from their elders back home resound in their minds.</p><p></p><p>Miu Lun is dead!</p><p></p><p>The young master of the Miu clan, at the Nine Transformations Divine Source realm, is dead!</p><p></p><p>...</p><p></p><p>"We are both supreme celestial champions of the Divine Yang realm, so why are you always chasing after me?" </p><p></p><p>In the secret realm of the sands, a Divine Yang realm supreme celestial champion finally couldn't hold back and stopped, turning around with a gloomy expression to look at the bald man in front of him.</p><p></p><p>Zhou Yuan was truly puzzled. "We're all Divine Source realm cultivators, so why can't we wait until the celestial champion tea party to fight to the death? Why must it be here in the secret realm of the sands? If someone loses and gets eliminated from the secret realm, they'll lose so much face in front of everyone. After all, there are only twenty of us Divine Yang realm supreme celestial champions!"</p><p></p><p>"No, I can't wait any longer. I urgently need to test my current strength, and you're the only Divine Yang realm cultivator I've found so far. If you blame anyone, blame your bad luck."</p><p></p><p>Li Shu Yan spoke flatly, without expression.</p><p></p><p>Hearing this, Zhou Yuan immediately burned with rage, growling, "Blame my bad luck? Are you being too arrogant? If I didn't want to waste time in the secret realm, do you really think I'd be afraid of you?"</p><p></p><p>Li Shu Yan smiled. "Then let's have a fight. You'd better be strong, or it won't be interesting."</p><p></p><p>"Fuck!" </p><p></p><p>Zhou Yuan couldn't hold back a curse, his body trembling as a illusory, dazzling sun suddenly rose behind him.</p><p></p><p>He could no longer restrain himself. Even if this bald man didn't want to fight, he wouldn't let him off today. He had to teach him a lesson!</p><p></p><p>Seeing that this person only had a single dazzling sun, Li Shu Yan couldn't help but flash a hint of disappointment in his eyes. He was a bit weak.</p><p></p><p>Immediately, he turned and wanted to leave.</p><p></p><p>"Haha, scared? Finished boasting and now want to leave? It's not that easy!" </p><p></p><p>Zhou Yuan thought the bald man was afraid, and his determination to punish him was instantly solidified.</p><p></p><p>He immediately gestured with his hands, and the violent spiritual energy of the Divine Yang realm suddenly erupted in this space, whipping up dozens of massive sand dragons around him, their momentum terrifying.</p><p></p><p>Countless grains of sand condensed into thousands upon thousands of sand blades!</p><p></p><p>Zhou Yuan's movements suddenly paused, and he abruptly slapped his hand towards Li Shu Yan.</p><p></p><p>"Go!"</p><p></p><p>Whoosh, whoosh, whoosh—</p><p></p><p>The densely packed sand blades moved, all shooting towards Li Shu Yan!</p><p></p><p>Although made of sand, their sharpness was no less than divine weapons.</p><p></p><p>"Hmm?" </p><p></p><p>Li Shu Yan was startled, turning around with a dazed expression to look at the countless sand blades rushing towards him.</p><p></p><p>In the next moment, all the sand blades one after another crashed into Li Shu Yan's flesh!</p><p></p><p>"Clang, clang, clang, clang, clang—!"</p><p></p><p>The sound of weapons colliding rang out, incessant.</p><p></p><p>After a moment,</p><p></p><p>Zhou Yuan was dumbfounded. He watched, eyes wide, as the bald man blocked all the sand blades with just his physical body...</p><p></p><p>The bald man remained motionless, standing in place with a blank expression, not even using any spiritual energy. He had simply blocked them with his bare flesh.</p><p></p><p>Here is the full English translation of the Chinese excerpt:</p><p></p><p>What's this?</p><p></p><p>New 69 book bar 99 SHUX.COM</p><p></p><p>Zhou Yuan panicked, knowing he might have encountered a monster, a cultivated monster!</p><p></p><p>Li Shuyan glanced down at himself, not even a single scratch......</p><p></p><p>The previous ten years of tempering by the master was truly formidable.</p><p></p><p>After all, he hadn't even used the Myriad Flames Incantation just now.</p><p></p><p>Li Shuyan pursed his lips and looked at the obviously distracted Celestial Emperor of the Divine Yang Realm, asking, "What do you mean?"</p><p></p><p>"N-nothing." </p><p></p><p>Zhou Yuan twitched his mouth and said, cautiously starting to back away.</p><p></p><p>Li Shuyan seemed to not have noticed his little movements and asked hesitantly, "You just tried to attack me, right?"</p><p></p><p>Zhou Yuan: "......"</p><p></p><p>But the next moment, he saw the bald man rushing towards him!</p><p></p><p>He crouched down and suddenly threw a fierce punch!</p><p></p><p>A huge fist grew larger and larger in Zhou Yuan's eyes, which really scared the piss out of him.</p><p></p><p>Instinctively, he took out a jade token, crushed it in a grip, but as soon as he crushed it, he regretted it. But time waits for no one, and in a flash, he was teleported away, Li Shuyan's punch hitting nothing but air.</p><p></p><p>...</p><p></p><p>At the same time,</p><p></p><p>Zhou Yuan was teleported out, indicating that he had been eliminated.</p><p></p><p>"Damn it!! Damn that bald-headed bastard!!" </p><p></p><p>He crouched down and angrily pounded the ground, the tremors causing the surrounding area to shake and crack.</p><p></p><p>Many cultivators snapped out of their daze, shocked to see that a Celestial Emperor of the Divine Yang Realm had actually been eliminated! This was the first one so far!</p><p></p><p>The young master of the Wang City Zhou Clan, Zhou Yuan?!</p><p></p><p>Those eliminated Celestial Emperors of the Divine Element Realm felt a little more at ease, thinking that if even a Divine Yang Realm Celestial Emperor could be eliminated, then their own elimination might not be so hard to accept.</p><p></p><p>Sensing the many gazes on him, Zhou Yuan's face looked ugly, as if he had eaten shit.</p><p></p><p>He didn't want to stay there any longer, so he paid his respects to the equally stunned Duan Jiuxiong, and quickly disappeared.</p><p></p><p>He had to go tell his father, and when that bald-headed guy came out, he would definitely teach him a lesson!</p><p></p><p>Ah, he had failed to make it into the final 1,500, what a huge embarrassment!</p><p></p><p>...</p><p></p><p>Time passed to the fifth day.</p><p></p><p>The Sand Secret Realm finally had only 1,500 Celestial Emperors left.</p><p></p><p>During this period, including Miu Lun who was killed by Lu Changsheng, a total of 100 Celestial Emperors of the Divine Element Realm had been eliminated, all due to bad luck.</p><p></p><p>As for the Celestial Emperors of the Divine Yang Realm, only Zhou Yuan had been eliminated.</p><p></p><p>On Lu Changsheng's side, ever since Blood Demon Moon had come, no other Celestial Emperors had come to him.</p><p></p><p>This puzzled Fu Shiyu and the others.</p><p></p><p>Meanwhile, outside the Sand Secret Realm,</p><p></p><p>Duan Jiuxiong was slightly satisfied, a little faster than he had expected, and then smiled, "Good! The final 1,500 Celestial Emperors have been decided, those in the Secret Realm, crush your jade tokens and come out!"</p><p></p><p>His voice also echoed through the Sand Secret Realm.</p><p></p><p>Fu Liancai, Liu Tu, and Liu Qing were now excited, because they didn't see Fu Shiyu's group among the eliminated Celestial Emperors.</p><p></p><p>That meant Fu Shiyu's group had made it into the final 1,500.</p><p></p><p>They couldn't help but recall that when they entered the Secret Realm, Fu Shiyu's group seemed to have followed Senior Lu...</p><p></p><p>Presumably, it was with Senior Lu's help that they had managed to make it to the final moment.</p><p></p><p>They knew very well the strengths and weaknesses of their own children.</p><p></p><p>Thinking of the rich rewards for making it into the final 1,500, their eyes gleamed with excitement.</p>

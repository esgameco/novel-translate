        <h1>Chapter 460</h1>
        <div class="content">
            <p>Here is the full English translation of the Chinese excerpt:</p><p></p><p>After leaving the Tianxiang Tower, He Lian came to a secluded attic that was heavily guarded.</p><p></p><p>"Clan Leader!" </p><p></p><p>The clansman on guard hurriedly bowed.</p><p></p><p>"Any abnormalities?" He Lian asked indifferently.</p><p></p><p>"Clan Leader, rest assured, we have eliminated even the flies coming and going," the clansman immediately assured.</p><p></p><p>"Mm."</p><p></p><p>He Lian nodded slightly, then waved his hand to open the door and entered the attic.</p><p></p><p>Inside the attic,</p><p></p><p>He Lian quickly walked to a room, and after pushing open the door, he saw a stunningly beautiful woman dressed in a phoenix robe, and he finally let out a sigh of relief.</p><p></p><p>"Why have you come?" </p><p></p><p>He Xitong raised her eyes and looked at He Lian, speaking indifferently.</p><p></p><p>He Lian looked at He Xitong for a while, then sighed, "In a few more days, we will be able to start the refinement of the Millennium Calamity Body. On behalf of our clan, the Clan Leader thanks you."</p><p></p><p>"Spare me your hypocritical words." He Xitong's expression was blank.</p><p></p><p>Even though she knew the refinement date had been moved up, her heart seemed to have little waves.</p><p></p><p>He Lian paused, not getting angry, "That's right, Xitong, it is the fault of our clan. Originally, we wanted to bring you back to the clan and nurture you properly, but unfortunately, the plan couldn't keep up with the changes. For the future of our clan, we can only make you suffer. But don't worry, all the sacrifices you have made will be remembered by the generations of our clan members."</p><p></p><p>For these grand words, He Xitong's gaze remained calm, as if she hadn't heard them.</p><p></p><p>"Let me see her." He Xitong suddenly said, she just wanted to know why her so-called mother had abandoned her father and herself.</p><p></p><p>Hearing this, He Lian naturally knew who He Xitong was referring to, and his gaze immediately turned cold: "I'll tell you, your mother disregarded the clan rules and associated with an outsider. If she hadn't given birth to you, the Millennium Calamity Body, she would have been executed long ago!"</p><p></p><p>He Xitong's heart felt a sense of foreboding, and she slowly stood up, her beautiful eyes staring at He Lian, "Where is she?"</p><p></p><p>"Telling you won't hurt. Your mother has long been thrown into our clan's Soul-Devouring Abyss. After so many years, I don't know how she's doing now, hehe." He Lian said coldly, thinking she's probably dead.</p><p></p><p>"Soul-Devouring Abyss... What is that place?"</p><p></p><p>He Lian: "The Soul-Devouring Abyss is naturally a place of punishment. Every moment, one has to endure the pain of their soul being torn apart. It's worse than a fate worse than death."</p><p></p><p>He Xitong's voice trembled slightly, "When was she sent there?"</p><p></p><p>He Lian closed his eyes, "I can't remember clearly, maybe tens of thousands of years ago, or even longer..."</p><p></p><p>He Xitong's figure swayed, and her face quickly lost its ruddy glow.</p><p></p><p>She finally knew why that person had abandoned her and her father and never returned - she had been thrown into the Soul-Devouring Abyss...</p><p></p><p>To imagine the soul enduring tens of thousands of years, or even longer, of being torn apart, He Xitong didn't dare to imagine the kind of pain that would be.</p><p></p><p>He Xitong's eyes gradually became moist, and she stared at He Lian, trembling, "I... I can accept the refinement, but I have a request - release her from the Soul-Devouring Abyss, and let me secretly see her, even if she's alive or dead..."</p><p></p><p>He Lian's gaze flickered as he looked at He Xitong for a while, saying, "After so much time has passed, I can't guarantee she's still alive..."</p><p></p><p>He Xitong tilted her head back slightly, closing her eyes, and a tear fell from the corner of her eye.</p><p></p><p>"Take me to see her, whether she's alive or dead, I will obediently accept the refinement."</p><p></p><p>He Lian pondered for a moment, "Alright, in this final moment, the Clan Leader will fulfill this request of yours!"</p><p></p><p>After saying that, He Lian waved his hand, and he and He Xitong disappeared from the attic.</p><p></p><p>When they reappeared, the surrounding environment had become gloomy.</p><p></p><p>It was cold, damp, and had a rotten smell...</p><p></p><p>And suddenly, a terrifying aura descended.</p><p></p><p>Here is the full English translation of the Chinese excerpt:</p><p></p><p>The Agonizing Pain of the Devouring Soul!</p><p></p><p>He Xitong's face turned pale, this sudden appearance of a pain that felt like her soul was being mysteriously bitten almost caused her to suffocate!</p><p></p><p>Beside her, He Lian waved her sleeve, and a layer of light enveloped He Xitong.</p><p></p><p>"How is it, do you feel your soul being torn?" </p><p></p><p>After the pain in her soul disappeared, He Xitong lowered her head and asked, "What was that...?"</p><p></p><p>"In this Devouring Soul Abyss, every inch of the air contains a mysterious force that bites the soul," He Lian explained calmly.</p><p></p><p>"That kind of pain where the soul is torn, can anyone really endure it for tens of thousands of years or even longer...?"</p><p></p><p>He Xitong thought of her unseen mother, who under this endless darkness, was enduring that kind of pain every moment, and for such a long time. Her heart trembled uncontrollably.</p><p></p><p>He Lian turned her head and looked at He Xitong for a while, then said:</p><p></p><p>"To be honest, our Clan Leader does not believe that anyone can endure the biting in the Devouring Soul Abyss for that long. They may be able to withstand it for a hundred or a thousand years through sheer willpower, but beyond ten thousand years, absolutely not, no one has that strong of a will."</p><p></p><p>You must know that when the clan's disciples make mistakes and are thrown in here, most of them can't last more than a few years, so they are usually released.</p><p></p><p>In this place, because one is constantly subjected to the biting, even if one wants to sit down and immerse oneself in cultivation, it cannot be done, so time passes very slowly.</p><p></p><p>He Xitong's heart grew gloomy as she looked around and murmured, "Let's see if we can at least find the remains..."</p><p></p><p>He Lian nodded slightly, although that despicable person should be dead, her remains should still be here.</p><p></p><p>After all, this Devouring Soul Abyss only devours the soul, not the physical body, and at that level of cultivation, even if the corpse is placed in this environment, it is extremely difficult for it to decompose.</p><p></p><p>Subsequently, He Lian bit her middle finger and pressed it to her brow, relying on the clan's unique bloodline sense, she opened her glowing eyes and began to scan the Devouring Soul Abyss...</p><p></p><p>Beside her, He Xitong waited quietly, her face downcast and her expression unreadable, but the slight trembling of her body indicated that she was very unsettled.</p><p></p><p>"Huh?"</p><p></p><p>Suddenly, He Lian's brow furrowed, and she let out a soft exclamation. She released her action, and the light in her eyes gradually faded. With a puzzled gaze, she walked towards a certain direction:</p><p></p><p>"Follow me, Clan Leader."</p><p></p><p>He Xitong was startled, her thoughts in disarray as she followed.</p><p></p><p>Soon, He Xitong followed He Lian to a puddle, where a figure was lying flat.</p><p></p><p>He Xitong had a premonition, her pupils contracting as she looked at the woman in the puddle...</p><p></p><p>The woman had disheveled hair, was emaciated, and her face was filthy, but the precious robe she wore was still spotlessly clean.</p><p></p><p>The woman seemed to have no signs of life...</p><p></p><p>"She... is actually still alive... How is this possible?" He Lian exclaimed in disbelief.</p><p></p><p>"Conceal your presence," He Lian suddenly said, looking at the already stunned He Xitong.</p><p></p><p>He Xitong bit her teeth and hid her presence.</p><p></p><p>Seeing this, He Lian stepped up to the edge of the puddle and waved her hand, enveloping the woman in the same light.</p><p></p><p>At the moment the light enveloped the woman, her body suddenly convulsed violently!</p><p></p><p>...</p><p></p><p>For the fastest updates on this flawless novel, please visit www.feixs.com</p><p></p><p>For mobile access, go to https://m.feixs.com/chapter-45751-38225579</p>

        <div class="content">
            <p>Here is the full English translation of the Chinese excerpt:</p><p></p><p>Inside the Ascension Passage. ‚ôôüí£Ôºñ‚ûàÔº≥ùì±ÔΩïùîµ.ùí∏ùëú‚ìú‚ô¶üêü</p><p></p><p>A dazzling radiance spilled forth.</p><p></p><p>Lu Changsheng walked unhurriedly in front, but each step he took covered an exceptionally vast distance.</p><p></p><p>Chu Xiruo and Zhang Youdao closely followed behind him.</p><p></p><p>At this moment, Zhang Youdao's expression was dazed, his face deathly pale and bloodless!</p><p></p><p>Chu Xiruo had just told him everything, and he understood it all...</p><p></p><p>And he also knew that the young man in blue robes and the woman in white dress before them were from the Immortal Realm.</p><p></p><p>This explained why the restrictions on the Ascension Passage had not been activated - it finally made sense.</p><p></p><p>Although he did not know why the Immortal Realm cultivators would appear in the Mortal Realm, this was clearly not the problem he should be considering right now.</p><p></p><p>There were people guarding the other end of the Ascension Passage, waiting to ambush them...</p><p></p><p>Then, the previous Elders who had ascended from the Tranquil Garden, could it be that they were...?</p><p></p><p>"Esteemed Immortals, since the Ascension Passage has been blocked, what should we do?" </p><p></p><p>Zhang Youdao took a deep breath, forcibly calming himself down, and asked respectfully.</p><p></p><p>Compared to the previous cultivators who had ascended from the Mortal Realm, he at least knew some things in advance, unlike them... who died in complete bewilderment!</p><p></p><p>Chu Xiruo waved her hand and said, "Just call us Seniors, calling us Immortals is too much, as cultivators of the Immortal Realm, unless one reaches the Great Dao Realm, they are all considered inferior."</p><p></p><p>She continued in a solemn voice, "As for the blockade at the other end of the Ascension Passage, we can only forcibly break through it later. A great battle is unavoidable, so be mentally prepared."</p><p></p><p>Zhang Youdao's heart trembled. He had just ascended, how could he possibly fight against the veteran Immortals of the Immortal Realm?</p><p></p><p>But soon, a brilliant light of the will to survive burst forth in his eyes. In this situation, the only choice was to fight for his life!</p><p></p><p>Chu Xiruo glanced at the silent figure of Lu Changsheng in front of her, and she also had some doubts in her heart.</p><p></p><p>If that Turtle Daoist Companion had also come, the chances of success would be even greater.</p><p></p><p>However, thinking about Lu Changsheng's strange methods outside the Tranquil Garden earlier, her heart calmed down a bit.</p><p></p><p>In her view, Lu Changsheng's cultivation in the Immortal Realm was likely not too low. She was at the Eighth Rank of the Earth Immortal realm, so Lu Changsheng was most likely a Sky Immortal, but the specific rank was unknown.</p><p></p><p>"Alright, you two be quiet and don't be nervous," </p><p></p><p>At this time, Lu Changsheng turned his head and smiled faintly.</p><p></p><p>Seeing this smile, Zhang Youdao and Chu Xiruo's hearts inexplicably settled down.</p><p></p><p>After a moment.</p><p></p><p>An ancient-looking large door appeared before their eyes.</p><p></p><p>Zhang Youdao and Chu Xiruo's hearts tightened, they knew that there were people waiting for them outside the door...</p><p></p><p>As soon as they pushed it open, a great battle would begin.</p><p></p><p>Lu Changsheng walked up to the door and lightly placed his hand on it...</p><p></p><p>Seeing this, Chu Xiruo and Zhang Youdao clenched their fists...</p><p></p><p>Creak!</p><p></p><p>The door was pushed open, revealing an endless desert and a scorching sun hanging high in the sky.</p><p></p><p>Powerful Immortal Qi instantly enveloped Lu Changsheng and the others.</p><p></p><p>The newly arrived Zhang Youdao immediately felt extremely comfortable, as if his entire meridians were joyfully awakened.</p><p></p><p>Soon, a mocking laughter reached their ears.</p><p></p><p>"Hehe, Brother, we've just started our shift, and some pitiful insects have come to die."</p><p></p><p>"Lucky them, after we kill this insect, we can return to the Sect and report. The next Brothers on duty won't see another insect ascending for who knows how long, haha."</p><p></p><p>"Hmm? There are three insects? It seems this place called the Mortal Realm is not bad after all, what a pity..."</p><p></p><p>"..."</p><p></p><p>Listening to these mocking words,</p><p></p><p>Lu Changsheng's group slowly stepped out of the doorway,</p><p></p><p>Soon, six disciples in golden robes appeared before Lu Changsheng's eyes.</p><p></p><p>"Brother Lu! They've changed shifts!" </p><p></p><p>Chu Xiruo said solemnly. Previously, when she came, it was a different group of five disciples.</p><p></p><p>At this moment, Zhang Youdao was already extremely nervous, the six people before him gave him a huge sense of oppression!</p><p></p><p>"You three insects are unlucky, you can blame it on the cultivator from your Realm who offended someone before." </p><p></p><p>The leading disciple said arrogantly from above.</p><p></p><p>Here is the full English translation of the Chinese novel excerpt:</p><p></p><p>"Hehe, senior brother, don't be so hasty. Although this woman is wearing a veil, her figure is really quite nice, just look at that slender waist, tsk tsk. Why don't we let the brothers have a little fun and enjoy themselves?" said one of the disciples with a lecherous grin as he eyed Chu Xiran.</p><p></p><p>"Alright, you little rascal..." Hearing this, the six of them started chuckling smugly.</p><p></p><p>They didn't even bother to expend any effort to detect the three insignificant ants before them.</p><p></p><p>After all, they were already fish in a barrel.</p><p></p><p>"You all!" Chu Xiran heard this and became furious with embarrassment. She turned her head and said, "Companion Lu, let's take action!"</p><p></p><p>Just then!</p><p></p><p>The always silent Lu Changsheng gently raised his hand, and then pressed down!</p><p></p><p>Boom!!!</p><p></p><p>Five out of the six disciples exploded into a bloody mist.</p><p></p><p>The remaining disciple's smile froze on his face...</p><p></p><p>"You, you!" This disciple's throat was dry, and he looked at Lu Changsheng with a gaze like that of seeing a ghost.</p><p></p><p>Lu Changsheng seemed unperturbed. He grabbed this disciple from a distance and suspended him in front of himself.</p><p></p><p>Standing with his hands behind his back, a blue light flashed in his eyes.</p><p></p><p>The disciple then became dazed.</p><p></p><p>After the memory extraction was complete, the disciple quickly regained his senses. Suppressing his headache, he fearfully cried out, "Who, who are you..."</p><p></p><p>But before he could finish, he too exploded into a bloody mist.</p><p></p><p>The world fell silent.</p><p></p><p>"Uh..."</p><p></p><p>Chu Xiran and Zhang Youdao stood dumbfounded at the original spot, somewhat at a loss.</p><p></p><p>The series of events that had just occurred had happened in the blink of an eye, and they couldn't react to it at all.</p><p></p><p>"Senior, Senior Companion Lu..."</p><p></p><p>Chu Xiran bent down and called out in a trembling voice. She no longer dared to address him as "companion."  She was not worthy.</p><p></p><p>Zhang Youdao was also trembling in fear. He was not stupid, he knew they had encountered a supreme expert.</p><p></p><p>Lu Changsheng turned his head to look at them, a gentle smile appearing on his face. "I've already said not to be nervous, I naturally won't deceive you."</p><p></p><p>"Yes, yes, senior is right!" Chu Xiran and Zhang Youdao nodded their heads rapidly, like pecking chicks.</p><p></p><p>"Now we should be in the Southern Immortal Realm within the Four Directions Immortal Realm..." Lu Changsheng looked up at the sky and said softly.</p><p></p><p>Chu Xiran and Zhang Youdao bent down and kept their heads lowered, not daring to utter a word.</p><p></p><p>Chu Xiran's mind was still in a complete daze. She just couldn't understand how they could have encountered such a powerful expert in this mere Spiritual Dust Realm.</p><p></p><p>This, this had to be at least at the Golden Immortal Realm, right?</p><p></p><p>"I'll take you out of this desert, and then you can leave." </p><p></p><p>Lu Changsheng said a sentence, and then casually waved his sleeve.</p><p></p><p>The two bewildered people then disappeared from the vast desert.</p><p></p><p>...</p><p></p><p>Just as the old turtle had said, the sects in the Immortal Realm, even the lower-tier ones, were far superior to those in the Spiritual Dust Realm, by at least a hundredfold.</p><p></p><p>The grand aura, the boundless immortal qi!</p><p></p><p>It was unimaginable that the magnificent buildings stretching for thousands of miles were all owned by a single sect.</p><p></p><p>Outside the Eternal Heaven Grand Sect.</p><p></p><p>Zhang Youdao's gaze trembled as he looked at the scene before him, it was too grand! Except for the mysterious power that was purer than spiritual energy in the desert, nothing else was different before. It was only after leaving the desert that he realized his previous self was just a frog in a well, only seeing a small patch of sky.</p><p></p><p>As for Chu Xiran, her pupils had already constricted tightly. This sect was none other than... the sect of the six disciples who had died at the ascension portal before!</p><p></p><p>"Alright, we're now a distance away from that desert. You two can leave separately," Lu Changsheng said, then turned and walked towards the Eternal Heaven Grand Sect.</p><p></p><p>"Senior, those six disciples earlier were from this sect. You, you..." Chu Xiran looked at the figure in blue robes, trembling as she spoke.</p><p></p><p>Chu Xiran's family was not too far from this Eternal Heaven Grand Sect. She naturally recognized this sect. In this remote Southern Immortal Realm, the Eternal Heaven Grand Sect was a hegemon-level existence!</p><p></p><p>She didn't know why Lu Changsheng, who had just killed the sect's disciples, still dared to visit.</p><p></p><p>Lu Changsheng's footsteps paused, and a benevolent smile appeared on the corner of his mouth, then he continued walking.</p><p></p><p>"What? Just because I killed a few of their disciples, I can't visit them?"</p>

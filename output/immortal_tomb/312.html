        <div class="content">
            <p>Here is my translation of the Chinese text you provided:</p><p></p><p>"But if your methods are only this, then die!" </p><p></p><p>Lu Changsheng let out a cold laugh, his right hand slowly gripping the hilt of the Zhanxu sword on his left waist...</p><p></p><p>Then he suddenly drew it out!</p><p></p><p>"Clang—!"</p><p></p><p>An even more piercing sword cry rang out, directly overwhelming the sword cries of the nine Shen Jian Elders, becoming the sole one here!!</p><p></p><p>The terrifying azure sword qi exploded from the sword tip, like a tidal wave that never ceased!</p><p></p><p>The sky at this moment turned completely azure!</p><p></p><p>Within the all-encompassing azure, a green figure stood holding a sword, like a banished immortal. </p><p></p><p>When Lu Changsheng drew his sword, the Shen Jian Elders' faces turned pale!</p><p></p><p>They looked at the scene before them in disbelief.</p><p></p><p>How could Lu Changsheng's sword dao attainments be more exquisite than the ancient Huanggu Sword Clan that excelled at the sword dao?</p><p></p><p>In a flash, the azure sword qi and the nine sword qi collided!</p><p></p><p>A thunderous explosion that shook heaven and earth arose, stirring up a multicolored ripple that spread in all directions!</p><p></p><p>The nine sword qi scattered in the countless horrified gazes.</p><p></p><p>Mournful sword cries echoed through the air.</p><p></p><p>"Pu—"</p><p></p><p>The Shen Jian Elders retreated several thousand feet, simultaneously spitting out a mouthful of fresh blood, their eyes looking at the unmoving figure in green with difficulty.</p><p></p><p>How could Lu Changsheng have become so powerful!</p><p></p><p>Previously they could still suppress him, but now they felt an insurmountable sense of powerlessness!</p><p></p><p>But at this moment they had no time to ponder, for the azure sword qi continued to advance relentlessly!</p><p></p><p>The Shen Jian Elders suddenly felt their hearts tighten, frantically retreating towards the towering stone sword in the center of the Shen Jian Clan.</p><p></p><p>"You all follow me to seal the formation, summon the Divine Sword to suppress him!"</p><p></p><p>The Shen Jian Elder said solemnly.</p><p></p><p>The other eight people heard this and their faces grew anxious, but they still hesitated.</p><p></p><p>The Shen Jian Clan Chief said with difficulty, "Elder, will the Divine Sword directly slay Lu Changsheng? After all, the power of the Divine Sword is difficult for us to control. If Lu Changsheng is slain, then the Eternal Life Body..."</p><p></p><p>Indeed, their greatest reliance was not afraid of Lu Changsheng, but the towering stone sword standing in the center of the Shen Jian Clan!</p><p>This was the greatest foundation of their ancient Huanggu Sword Clan!</p><p></p><p>The Shen Jian Elder frowned and shouted, "We are in mortal danger, yet you are still thinking about the Eternal Life Body. Even if we obtain the Eternal Life Body, we need to be alive to enjoy it! Stop wasting time, summon the Divine Sword!"</p><p></p><p>"Yes..." The crowd could only obey. They also knew that without summoning the Divine Sword, they could not defeat Lu Changsheng, but their hearts were still very unwilling regarding the Eternal Life Body!</p><p></p><p>"Swoosh—"</p><p></p><p>The azure sword qi surged forward, ruthless and boundless!</p><p></p><p>The Shen Jian Elder panicked, his hands forming seals as he shouted, "I, the Shen Jian Clan Elder!"</p><p></p><p>"I, the Shen Jian Clan Chief (Elder)!"</p><p></p><p>"We, the six great Sword Masters of the Shen Jian Clan!"</p><p></p><p>They spoke in unison, their solemn voices echoing through the heavens and earth:</p><p></p><p>"A powerful enemy has invaded, the Sword Clan is in dire straits, we are without strategy, so we specially summon the Divine Sword to suppress the enemy!"</p><p></p><p>The next moment, brilliant light burst forth from their hands and sank into the towering stone sword!</p><p></p><p>"Rumble—"</p><p></p><p>Immediately, everyone trembled as they saw the massive stone sword move!</p><p></p><p>This sight was extremely stimulating to the visual senses!</p><p></p><p>Especially for the many disciples of the Shen Jian Clan, they had always thought this was just a symbol of their Shen Jian Clan, never imagining that this stone sword was the foundation of their ancient Huanggu Sword Clan.</p><p></p><p>"Master... Master..." </p><p></p><p>Blood Demon Moon looked at Lu Changsheng with worried eyes, her heart pounding.</p><p></p><p>As the Holy Maiden of the Ancient Moon Blood Clan, she was also shocked by the power of the Huanggu Sword Clan today!</p><p></p><p>Although they were both part of the Eight Great Ancient Clans, Blood Demon Moon had to admit that the Huanggu Sword Clan was even stronger than her own Ancient Moon Blood Clan!</p><p></p><p>Rumble!</p><p></p><p>The towering stone sword slowly tilted, its dull-looking tip pointing towards Lu Changsheng!</p><p></p><p>Under this gigantic sword, an ordinary person would likely be frightened to death even before the battle began.</p><p></p><p>"Swoosh!"</p><p></p><p>A sword qi suddenly erupted from the stone sword, fiercely meeting Lu Changsheng's azure sword qi!</p><p></p><p>Here is the full English translation of the excerpt from the Chinese novel:</p><p></p><p>Li Shuyan and the others were alarmed to see that the sword qi of the teacher, who was usually invincible, had been dispersed!</p><p></p><p>Seeing this, the Ancestral Sword Saint heaved a sigh of relief. He looked at Lu Changsheng and laughed loudly, "Lu Changsheng, no matter how invincible you are, you will perish under my Ancient Desolate Divine Sword today!!"</p><p></p><p>The Sword Clan Leader and the others also had smiles on their faces. Although they could not obtain the Eternal Physique, Lu Changsheng's death would be a great relief for them.</p><p></p><p>As for his azure sword qi being dispersed, Lu Changsheng did not mind at all.</p><p></p><p>That sword strike, he had just casually waved it.</p><p></p><p>"Since you say I'm invincible, then I shall show you my true invincibility."</p><p></p><p>With that, Lu Changsheng directly threw the Slashing Void towards the Stone Sword!</p><p></p><p>"Swoosh!"</p><p></p><p>The Slashing Void stirred up dazzling light, piercing through the air!</p><p></p><p>Although its momentum was even more fierce than before, in the eyes of the Ancestral Sword Saint and the others, the might displayed by the Slashing Void was still far inferior to their Ancient Desolate Divine Sword!</p><p></p><p>Boom, the Stone Sword also moved at this time, the sword body floating up and rushing towards the Slashing Void as well!</p><p></p><p>Although the sword body was massive, it did not have the slightest sense of sluggishness, but was instead extremely agile!</p><p></p><p>The sword intent as vast as the sea permeated the heavens and the earth, and the crowd stood in the shadow, looking up blankly at the sky, their eyes filled with the reflections of the azure and the Stone Sword.</p><p></p><p>It was too big, the Stone Sword was simply too massive, and it was not an exaggeration to call it a sky-covering giant.</p><p></p><p>In comparison, the azure brilliance stirred up by that sword was utterly insignificant.</p><p></p><p>The two were completely incomparable.</p><p></p><p>Time passed in an instant, and in a moment, the Slashing Void carrying the light collided with the Stone Sword, faintly showing the might of an ant shaking the heavens!</p><p></p><p>Time seemed to stop at this moment, and countless gazes were fixed on the sky above!</p><p></p><p>"Clang—" Suddenly, an unprecedented, ultimate sword song resounded!</p><p></p><p>"Ah!" The ears of everyone present were deafened, and the sword song tore through their minds!</p><p></p><p>They collapsed to the ground, their bodies convulsing, foaming at the mouth.</p><p></p><p>Immediately afterwards, the azure light began to split the massive Stone Sword from the tip in the horrified eyes of the Ancestral Sword Saint and the others!!</p><p></p><p>The entire space shook incessantly, and the Ancestral Sword Saint and the others almost lost their balance in the air, their souls terrified at the sight of the incoming Slashing Void.</p><p></p><p>Impossible! Their Ancient Desolate Divine Sword was actually destroyed by Lu Changsheng like this!</p><p></p><p>How could this be? Their minds were in a complete daze, and their heartstrings were tightly stretched!</p><p></p><p>Lu Changsheng stood in the air, his blue robe fluttering, his black hair flying. His left hand was behind his back, and his right hand had two fingers raised slowly in front of his chest.</p><p></p><p>A calm and indifferent smile appeared on his face, but the words he spoke were extremely cold and murderous:</p><p></p><p>"Since you have offended me, then all of you from the Ancient Desolate Sword Clan... must die!"</p><p></p><p>With that, a light flickered on the tips of his fingers, and an unprecedented sword intent suddenly surged in the heavens and the earth!!</p><p></p><p>That terrifying sword intent was not ringing, but roaring, with the most captivating killing intent in the world howling!!</p><p></p><p>"Sizzle sizzle sizzle—!"</p><p></p><p>In an instant, countless sword shadows appeared in the sky above, centered on Lu Changsheng, numbering in the millions!</p><p></p><p>The small world of the Ancient Desolate Sword Clan was instantly shattered, exposing them to the Ancient Desolate Ruins!</p><p></p><p>"Ding ding ding ding ding ding!"</p><p></p><p>The millions of sword shadows actually trembled with sound, and even the countless experts in the Ancient Desolate Ruins heard it, their eyes widening as they frantically tore through space towards the location of the Ancient Desolate Sword Clan!</p><p></p><p>The terrifying killing intent of the sword shadows swept over everyone present!</p><p></p><p>Everyone was dumbfounded, extremely shocked as they stared at the countless sword shadows in the sky...</p><p></p><p>Even the Ancestral Sword Saint and the Sword Clan Leader were dumbfounded, filled with despair!</p><p></p><p>Such a realm of the Dao of the Sword... was enough to make them despair to the core!</p><p></p><p>They had been deeply shocked and overwhelmed, and for a moment, they even forgot the fear of facing death...</p><p></p><p>Until...</p><p></p><p>The sword shadows in the sky fell like a river of stars!!</p><p></p><p>And the cold and murderous voice of the blue-robed immortal shadow resounded throughout the Ancient Desolate Ruins:</p><p></p><p>"The one who slaughters the Ancient Desolate Sword Clan is Lu Changsheng."</p>

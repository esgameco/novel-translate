        <h1>Chapter 51</h1>
        <div class="content">
            <p>Here is the full English translation of the Chinese excerpt:</p><p></p><p>In the Eastern Domain, the Qingyun Sect. üéÑüçì‚ùª‚ùæùìº—íÔºµùï©.œÇùï†ùìÇ‚òÆüí¢</p><p></p><p>Today, the Qingyun Sect was more lively than usual.</p><p></p><p>The disciples had previously seen many spiritual boats approaching from the horizon.</p><p></p><p>At this time, there were dozens of figures in the main hall, all of them elders from the various sects in the Eastern Domain, as well as the elders of the Qingyun Sect itself. Fortunately, the Qingyun Sect's main hall was extremely spacious and could easily accommodate them.</p><p></p><p>"Hmm, why don't I see the venerable elder of your sect?"</p><p></p><p>"Yes, the old master, this time he came to have some medicinal pills refined, but where is he?"</p><p></p><p>"......"</p><p></p><p>The elders of the various sects were all looking for the figure of Gu Helin, but to no avail, so they turned to the Qingyun Sect elders with a smile.</p><p></p><p>It was clear that Gu Helin had a certain reputation in the immortal cultivation world.</p><p></p><p>"Hehe, esteemed elders of the various sects, Helin is still in the mortal realm at the moment," the Grand Elder said politely.</p><p></p><p>"I see." The elders of the various sects nodded.</p><p></p><p>At this moment, Shen Miaoyun slowly entered the hall from outside.</p><p></p><p>"Sect Master Shen."</p><p></p><p>The elders of the various sects hurriedly cupped their hands in greeting.</p><p></p><p>Shen Miaoyun swept her gaze across the elders in the hall, her face smiling, but in her heart, she sighed.</p><p></p><p>Indeed, there were too few sects willing to believe them, and the elders of the various sects numbered no more than fifteen...</p><p></p><p>The Eastern Domain was so vast, with countless large and small sects, yet only these few had come, and apart from a few sects like Feixing Valley that were roughly on par with her Qingyun Sect, the rest were mostly small sects.</p><p></p><p>Soon, Shen Miaoyun sat down on the dais.</p><p></p><p>As soon as she sat down, the Five Elders of Feixing Valley stood up.</p><p></p><p>"Sect Master Shen, could you please tell us what happened before that made your Qingyun Sect believe that the Demon and Devil Realms are plotting to seize the immortal tombs?"</p><p></p><p>Hearing this, the elders of the various sects looked intently at Shen Miaoyun on the dais.</p><p></p><p>After all, they had come here, which would undoubtedly take up a lot of their time. Wouldn't it be better to use that time to seclude themselves and search for treasures?</p><p></p><p>"Grand Elder, you can tell them," Shen Miaoyun said indifferently.</p><p></p><p>The Grand Elder bowed slightly and then looked at the elders of the various sects and began to speak: "Esteemed elders, the matter is as follows..."</p><p></p><p>A moment later,</p><p></p><p>The elders of the various sects frowned deeply in thought. It turned out that Gu Helin was the first to discover this matter.</p><p></p><p>And according to what the Grand Elder of the Qingyun Sect had just said and analyzed, combined with the unusual demonic calamities in the Lishui Empire in recent years, it seemed that this was indeed the case.</p><p></p><p>"Sect Master Shen, the Patriarch has ordered that I lead our disciples to guard Lishui and the surrounding secular empires for three years. If any unusual demonic calamities occur during this period, we will jointly spread the truth of this matter. But if no such demonic calamities occur during this period, we will return to the valley."</p><p></p><p>The Five Elders relaxed their brows and cupped their hands solemnly.</p><p></p><p>The other elders of the various sects also nodded in agreement. Indeed, the truth of this matter would have to be seen in the aftermath.</p><p></p><p>"Good, then I thank the esteemed elders for their efforts."</p><p></p><p>Shen Miaoyun stood up and bowed slightly.</p><p></p><p>"Sect Master Shen, then we shall take our leave."</p><p></p><p>Soon, the elders of the various sects paid their respects and one by one left the main hall, gathering their disciples and leaving.</p><p></p><p>"Sect Master, in three years, the Demon and Devil Realms will surely cause trouble again. When that time comes, the elders will see it with their own eyes and will surely believe!"</p><p></p><p>The Grand Elder looked at the departing elders and then at Shen Miaoyun, smiling excitedly.</p><p></p><p>Shen Miaoyun's face was expressionless, without a trace of joy.</p><p></p><p>Three years was not a long time for the Demon and Devil Realms. Whether they would cause trouble or not was uncertain, as they had once laid low for five years.</p><p></p><p>If the Demon and Devil Realms did not cause any trouble in these three years, then the Qingyun Sect would become a laughingstock.</p><p></p><p>"You may all leave, I am weary."</p><p></p><p>Shen Miaoyun waved her hand listlessly and closed her eyes.</p><p></p><p>The elders quietly withdrew.</p><p></p><p>"Sigh."</p><p></p><p>Shen Miaoyun sighed, waved towards the tea on the table, and the tea flew into her hand. She took a sip and opened her eyes.</p><p></p><p>Then she was stunned.</p><p></p><p>An unassuming middle-aged man in plain robes was standing in the main hall, looking at her indifferently.</p><p></p><p>Here is the full English translation of the Chinese excerpt:</p><p></p><p>She... </p><p></p><p>Xiu Shu Xia Book Bar ‚Üí www.69shu.com</p><p></p><p>Shen Miaoyun frowned unconsciously, wanting to rebuke, but her pupils suddenly shrank!</p><p></p><p>The memories in the depths of her mind surged like a spring, and she suddenly remembered!</p><p></p><p>The former peak master of Purple Extreme Thunder Peak!</p><p></p><p>The one who dominates the cultivation world of the Eastern Domain - Jiang Yuan!</p><p></p><p>"Senior Jiang! Senior Jiang!"</p><p></p><p>Shen Miaoyun hurried to the hall, approaching Jiang Yuan and deeply bowing, her tone slightly trembling.</p><p></p><p>This Jiang Yuan, she had only seen him once before when she was still in the Foundation Establishment stage.</p><p></p><p>She didn't know why he suddenly came to the Qingyun Sect today.</p><p></p><p>"The Sect Master of Qingyun Sect need not be so polite," Jiang Yuan said with a light smile, very amiable.</p><p></p><p>Shen Miaoyun slowly straightened up a bit, but still bent over respectfully and asked, "Senior Jiang, why have you suddenly come to the Qingyun Sect?"</p><p></p><p>She didn't think Jiang Yuan had come to see their Patriarch.</p><p></p><p>Their Patriarch might be a figure in the cultivation world of the Eastern Domain, but he wasn't at the level that would make Jiang Yuan come to meet him in person.</p><p></p><p>Jiang Yuan chuckled lightly, "I have come to understand the matter of the demonic and evil forces plotting to seize the immortal tomb. Can the Sect Master of Qingyun Sect inform me?"</p><p></p><p>Suddenly, Shen Miaoyun's heart started pounding rapidly!</p><p></p><p>A surge of joy welled up in her heart.</p><p></p><p>The one who dominates the cultivation world of the Eastern Domain is actually concerned about this matter? </p><p></p><p>Excellent!</p><p></p><p>If this Senior Jiang before her believes it, then the news that their Qingyun Sect had previously spread must have attracted the attention of the entire spiritual cultivation world!</p><p></p><p>"Senior Jiang, this matter is absolutely true!..." </p><p></p><p>Quickly, Shen Miaoyun told Jiang Yuan all the details of the incident.</p><p></p><p>Jiang Yuan nodded from time to time, his expression unchanged.</p><p></p><p>"If it weren't for the several interventions of a Nascent Soul senior, our Secular Empire would have suffered heavy losses," Shen Miaoyun sighed lightly at the end.</p><p></p><p>Jiang Yuan's gaze flickered, "What Nascent Soul cultivator? What is his name?"</p><p></p><p>Among the entire spiritual cultivation world, although Nascent Soul cultivators were not as rare as Tribulation Transcendence cultivators, they were still not many.</p><p></p><p>He basically knew them all.</p><p></p><p>"That Nascent Soul senior is called Lu Changsheng."</p><p></p><p>"Lu Changsheng?" </p><p></p><p>Jiang Yuan's brow raised, he was quite certain he had never heard of this name before.</p><p></p><p>Even among the Nascent Soul cultivators of the South, West, and North Domains, there was no one named Lu Changsheng.</p><p></p><p>Seeing Jiang Yuan's expression, Shen Miaoyun knew what he was thinking, and respectfully said, "Senior Jiang, that Nascent Soul senior was previously in seclusion."</p><p></p><p>Jiang Yuan nodded, no longer paying much attention. He suddenly pointed a finger at Shen Miaoyun's forehead!</p><p></p><p>Shen Miaoyun's gaze instantly became dazed.</p><p></p><p>Jiang Yuan's expression was emotionless as he extracted all the memories in Shen Miaoyun's mind - the mysterious and concentrated demonic calamity, the Lixing Empire closest to the immortal tomb, and the information about a young man in azure robes.</p><p></p><p>"Based on this, the matter of the demonic and evil forces plotting to seize the immortal tomb is true, haha, excellent..."</p><p></p><p>"This young man is the hidden Nascent Soul cultivator she just mentioned, indeed I have never seen him before..."</p><p></p><p>Saying this, Jiang Yuan withdrew his finger.</p><p></p><p>"Ugh..."</p><p></p><p>Shen Miaoyun fell to the ground, clutching her head in pale, agonized suffering. She had been soul-searched!</p><p></p><p>In this way, her hope of advancing to the Nascent Soul realm has become even more difficult!</p><p></p><p>But the other party was a Tribulation Transcendence cultivator, a single thought could overturn her Qingyun Sect, so she dared not be angry or speak up, much less question him.</p><p></p><p>Shen Miaoyun bitterly smiled, "Senior Jiang, I suppose you already know the truth of the matter. Can you please inform the cultivation sects? I believe they will believe it if it comes from you..."</p><p></p><p>Jiang Yuan looked at her expressionlessly, his figure gradually fading as he indifferently said, "As for the truth of this matter, Jiang has his own conclusions. The Sect Master of Qingyun Sect should rest well."</p><p></p><p>Hearing this, Shen Miaoyun was stunned for a moment, then tightly clutched her head in silence.</p><p></p><p>Regarding Jiang Yuan's soul-searching of Shen Miaoyun, Lu Changsheng, who was far away in Moyu, naturally sensed it immediately, but his expression remained unchanged as he continued eating and drinking.</p>

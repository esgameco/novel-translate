        <h1>Chapter 285</h1>
        <div class="content">
            <p>Here is the full English translation of the Chinese excerpt:</p><p></p><p>A Realm of Three Blazing Suns?! </p><p></p><p>Doesn't that mean the late-stage Divine Sun Realm? That would make him even stronger than Elder Ouyang!</p><p></p><p>Li Shuyan tightly gripped the scroll in his hand, staring at the four characters "Myriad Forging Flame Technique", completely stunned.</p><p></p><p>He knew his teacher's personality and strength wouldn't allow him to joke around.</p><p></p><p>But, but, he was only at the eighth layer of the Divine Cloud Realm. After mastering this Myriad Forging Flame Technique, would he really not fear the experts of the late-stage Divine Sun Realm?</p><p></p><p>This level of advancement was a bit too much...</p><p></p><p>If that's the case, then the Myriad Forging Flame Technique scroll in his hand must be of an unimaginable level.</p><p></p><p>Lu Changsheng seemed to sense Li Shuyan's doubts, and calmly said, "This is not some technique or art, but a pure body tempering cultivation method."</p><p></p><p>Body tempering!</p><p></p><p>Li Shuyan caressed the scroll, resolute. </p><p></p><p>His teacher had relentlessly trained his physical body for ten years, all for the foundation of cultivating this Myriad Forging Flame Technique.</p><p></p><p>"Carefully read the contents of the scroll, then go cultivate at the volcano's mouth. But do not use any spiritual energy, you must rely solely on your physical body and willpower to endure."</p><p></p><p>Lu Changsheng said with a faint smile.</p><p></p><p>Li Shuyan's heartstrings immediately tensed. He stood up, bowed towards Lu Changsheng, then gravely looked down at the volcano.</p><p></p><p>Amid the thick smoke, a fiery red world faintly appeared, and a scorching heat assaulted him. Without using spiritual energy to protect his body, his hair was slightly curled, as if singed.</p><p></p><p>"Teacher, I understand." Li Shuyan lightly pressed his dry lips together.</p><p></p><p>"Mm. The Celestial Prodigy Assembly is about to begin. You only have a few decades. If you succeed, you can directly participate in the assembly. The rest of the cultivation of the Myriad Forging Flame Technique will be up to you."</p><p></p><p>With that, Lu Changsheng waved his hand, grasped the void, and disappeared from the volcano's peak.</p><p></p><p>"Farewell, teacher!" Li Shuyan hurriedly bowed.</p><p></p><p>Moments later, Li Shuyan sat down cross-legged on the spot, unrolling the scroll and carefully studying its contents, determined to memorize and comprehend every word before entering the volcano. If he could use spiritual energy to protect his body, the volcano would be no big deal. But if he used spiritual energy, the body tempering would be meaningless. He had to rely on the most pure physical body to withstand the volcano's scorching heat, to be reborn!</p><p></p><p>"If you succeed, you can directly participate in the Celestial Prodigy Assembly." </p><p></p><p>He understood - if he succeeded, he could join the assembly. If he failed, it would mean he perished in the cultivation of the Myriad Forging Flame Technique.</p><p></p><p>After a long time, Li Shuyan confirmed he had memorized the content of the Myriad Forging Flame Technique without a single mistake, then put away the scroll and stood up.</p><p></p><p>"Phew!" </p><p></p><p>He took a deep breath, then with a resolute gaze, stepped off the volcano's edge and plunged down!</p><p></p><p>.........</p><p></p><p>Seventy years later.</p><p></p><p>With the sudden arrival of an announcement, the Ancient Desolate Ruins was in an uproar.</p><p></p><p>The Celestial Prodigy Assembly was finally about to begin. </p><p></p><p>The venue for this session was in the central city of the Ancient Desolate Ruins - the Ancient Desolate Royal City.</p><p></p><p>This immediately sparked various shocked discussions:</p><p></p><p>"Whoa, this Celestial Prodigy Assembly is actually being held in the Ancient Desolate Royal City. Looks like this session will be a bit different!"</p><p></p><p>"Ah, it's going to be tough. As the royal city, there will be many top-tier celestial prodigies there. Plus, it's their home turf, putting the celestial prodigies from other areas at a disadvantage."</p><p></p><p>"Can't be helped, the venue was chosen by the Ancient Desolate Sword Clan. Whatever they say, goes."</p><p></p><p>Here is the full English translation of the Chinese excerpt:</p><p></p><p>"What are we waiting for? There's only 10 years left until the grand assembly officially begins. We should hurry to the Ancient Wasteland King's City. I'm sure many people have already rushed there, and if we're late, we might not even find a place."</p><p></p><p>"Don't worry, the king's city is huge. Even with a lot of people, it can accommodate us all. Come on, let's go and enjoy the spectacle."</p><p></p><p>"Haha, there will be a sea of people there to watch the excitement. I bet even the big shots from the Divine Concealment Realm will show up..."</p><p></p><p>With various discussions, countless forces began to lead their own prodigies towards the Ancient Wasteland King's City.</p><p></p><p>...</p><p></p><p>Thundercloud City.</p><p>The Fu Clan.</p><p></p><p>"Clan Leader, Elder Liu and Clan Leader Liu have arrived."</p><p></p><p>Just as an elder reported to Fu Liancai, Liu Tu and Liu Qing entered, followed by the Liu Clan's young master, Liu Xing.</p><p></p><p>Liu Qing came forward and cupped his hands, smiling, "Haha, Brother Fu, the Prodigy Assembly is about to begin. How about we two clans go together this time?"</p><p></p><p>Fu Liancai quickly stepped forward, first paying his respects to Liu Tu, "Senior Liu Tu."</p><p></p><p>Liu Tu nodded with a smile.</p><p></p><p>Behind him, Liu Xing quickly bowed, "Greetings, Clan Leader Fu."</p><p></p><p>Seeing this, Fu Liancai smiled kindly and then looked at Liu Qing, saying, "Sounds good, it would be good to have each other's support on the way. When shall we depart?"</p><p></p><p>Fu Shiyu was now at the Immortal Ancestor Realm's sixth transformation, and Fu Tao was at the first transformation. Though they were both under 10 million years old, they could still be considered impressive prodigies.</p><p></p><p>The Liu Clan's young master, Liu Xing, should be at about the same level as Fu Shiyu.</p><p></p><p>Liu Qing clapped his hands and said, "Then what are we waiting for? Let's set off immediately. This time, we don't aim for the three youngsters to get a ranking, but for them to see the world would be excellent."</p><p></p><p>"And while we're at it, we can also enjoy the excitement. Being cooped up in Thundercloud City all the time is so boring! Haha!"</p><p></p><p>Fu Liancai chuckled and then looked at the Grand Elder, saying, "Grand Elder, go summon Shiyu and Tao."</p><p></p><p>"Yes."</p><p></p><p>Soon, Fu Shiyu and Fu Tao arrived. After paying their respects to Liu Tu and Liu Qing, they stood behind Fu Liancai, knowing they were about to attend the Prodigy Assembly.</p><p></p><p>"Haha, Brother Fu, shall we be on our way then?" Liu Qing said with some anticipation.</p><p></p><p>However, Fu Liancai waved his hand and, in the puzzled gazes of the others, smiled and said, "Senior Liu, Brother Liu, please wait a moment. I need to go invite Senior Lu. He said he would attend the Prodigy Assembly."</p><p></p><p>Senior Lu? What Senior Lu?</p><p></p><p>The others were puzzled...</p><p></p><p>Liu Tu seemed to have realized something, his body shuddering, and he said hoarsely, "Liancai, the Senior Lu you speak of wouldn't be... that one, would it?"</p><p></p><p>Fu Liancai nodded with a smile.</p><p></p><p>Liu Tu and the others were suddenly shaken.</p><p></p><p>They had thought that person had long since left the Fu Clan, but it turned out he was still there...</p><p></p><p>Cough, cough, cough. They should not have invited the Fu Clan to come along. Going with that person would be quite a burden.</p><p></p><p>However, traveling with that person also had its advantages. With a Sword Cultivator at the late Divine Yang Realm guarding them, they would feel much safer amidst the dragons and snakes, the countless powerful experts, at the Prodigy Assembly.</p><p></p><p>Fu Liancai did not say more to them, and he quickly turned and headed towards the luxurious guest rooms.</p><p></p><p>...</p><p></p><p>Fu Liancai arrived at the outer courtyard, feeling slightly nostalgic, as he hadn't been here in a long time. He took a deep breath and then entered.</p><p></p><p>Soon, he was puzzled, as the black-robed young man who usually guarded the door was nowhere to be seen.</p><p></p><p>He frowned slightly, then came to the door and bowed, saying, "Senior Lu, the Prodigy Assembly is about to begin. You..."</p><p></p><p>But before he could finish, Lu Changsheng pushed open the door and smiled, "Then let's be on our way."</p>

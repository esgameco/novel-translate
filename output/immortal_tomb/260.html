        <h1>Chapter 260</h1>
        <div class="content">
            <p>Here is the full English translation of the Chinese excerpt:</p><p></p><p>"Inspect this? What a joke!"</p><p></p><p>Yintiao felt irritated. Since he had chosen to believe what Xing Tian said, did he still need to inspect it? </p><p></p><p>Although there was no evidence yet, the best course of action now was to remain uninvolved and stay out of it...</p><p></p><p>He then calmly said, "I already have evidence in my hands. What need is there to inspect it? Considering that you all have served my Divine Emperor Palace for some years, I will spare you the embarrassment and not reveal the evidence." ‚ò∫üë§‚ùª‚ùæÔΩìùì±‡∏¢–ñ.œÇùî¨œªüç´üëë</p><p></p><p>Hearing this, Xing Tian was stunned and looked at Yintiao strangely, thinking, "How shameless."</p><p></p><p>The Godly Kings like Ye Wutian were greatly anxious. If the Divine Emperor did not intervene to protect them, then today...</p><p></p><p>Just as they were about to say something,</p><p></p><p>"Enough stalling!" </p><p></p><p>Lu Changsheng said coldly.</p><p></p><p>Zhang Shengxu's heart trembled, knowing that it was impossible to ally with this old fox Yintiao. Since Lu Changsheng was about to make a move, it would be better to strike first!</p><p></p><p>He then stepped forward and shouted, "Lu Changsheng, come and fight!!"</p><p></p><p>He suddenly waved his feather duster, and endless divine energy erupted like a starry river!!</p><p></p><p>Boom!</p><p></p><p>The oppressive aura of the Divine Realm realm crashed down on the entire Miluo Snow Mountain!!</p><p></p><p>Above the snow mountain, a violent avalanche erupted, and only the drifting snowflakes remained suspended in the air!</p><p></p><p>In the venue, except for a few people who stood firm, the vast majority were crushed to the ground, with blood spraying wildly.</p><p></p><p>The entire venue was in shambles!</p><p></p><p>They were horrified. This was the power of a peak expert!</p><p></p><p>Just the oppressive aura alone could annihilate them?</p><p></p><p>The legendary Divine Realm realm was truly terrifying!</p><p></p><p>The next moment!</p><p></p><p>Zhang Shengxu leaped into the air, his hand forming seals, pointing his feather duster towards the sky.</p><p></p><p>Suddenly, a faint light connected from the feather duster to the heavens,</p><p></p><p>Boom!</p><p></p><p>The heavens and earth trembled, and a vast Yin-Yang Bagua diagram slowly appeared in the sky, rotating.</p><p></p><p>This terrifying scene left the people in the venue dumbfounded, completely forgetting that they were still under the Divine Realm oppressive aura!</p><p></p><p>Even Yintiao's gaze was slightly solemn!</p><p></p><p>He had dealt with Zhang Shengxu many times before and prided himself on understanding the latter's strength and methods...</p><p></p><p>But this technique, he had never seen it before.</p><p></p><p>This Zhang Shengxu, truly deserved to be a Taoist priest of the Tianyan Taoist Observatory, hiding his true abilities so deeply!</p><p></p><p>In the sky above,</p><p></p><p>Under the giant Yin-Yang Bagua diagram, Zhang Shengxu stood on his feather duster, appearing like an ant in comparison. He stared coldly at the figure in blue robes below and murmured, "Lu Changsheng... accept this move from this poor Taoist!"</p><p></p><p>The next moment, he suddenly swung his feather duster downwards!!</p><p></p><p>A low roar echoed between heaven and earth: "Yin-Yang Immortal Diagram! Suppress them for me!!"</p><p></p><p>Boom!</p><p></p><p>The rotating Yin-Yang Bagua diagram moved!</p><p></p><p>It descended like the end of the world, pressing down on the Miluo Snow Mountain!</p><p></p><p>The space within a radius of a million miles shook violently at that moment!</p><p></p><p>The Miluo Snow Mountain at the center was on the verge of collapsing, the avalanche within becoming even more savage, with countless trees snapping and wild beasts fleeing in terror!</p><p></p><p>In the venue, seeing the Bagua diagram pressing down, the people were in great turmoil, fear growing within them!</p><p></p><p>If no powerful expert stopped this attack, apart from the few Divine Emperors, everyone else here would die!!</p><p></p><p>Zhang the Taoist... was too strong. And too ruthless!</p><p></p><p>This was practically an indiscriminate attack!</p><p></p><p>Divine Emperor Yintiao and Xing Tian were also somewhat anxious at the moment, their peripheral vision, like the countless others, fixed on the figure in blue robes in the corner!</p><p></p><p>Whoosh whoosh whoosh - the howling winds!</p><p></p><p>Old Turtle and Chu Lingian and the others, under this oppressive aura, had already reached their limit and were being suppressed to the ground!</p><p></p><p>Old Turtle's mind was in chaos, for the first time feeling a desire for greater strength!</p><p></p><p>Previously, he had been too lazy.</p><p></p><p>The overwhelming power within this Bagua diagram was something he had never seen before in his life! The world was truly filled with countless powerful experts!</p><p></p><p>He couldn't help but doubt whether his master could block this attack!!</p><p></p><p>After returning from the immortal tomb, his master had become much stronger, but exactly how much stronger, he really didn't dare to confirm.</p><p></p><p>Fortunately, his master's gaze remained calm at the moment, which was the greatest comfort to him.</p><p></p><p>Based on his understanding of his master, he should... be able to handle it.</p><p></p><p>Chu Lingian and the others, however, were deathly pale, looking at the situation in despair...</p><p></p><p>Here is my translation of the Chinese excerpt you provided:</p><p></p><p>The Bagua diagram slowly descends! </p><p></p><p>One can't help but wonder, what person in this world could possibly block this unprecedented, peerless power?!</p><p></p><p>Suddenly, the figure in the blue robe in the corner moved, noticed by the peripheral vision of everyone present.</p><p></p><p>Lu Changsheng's figure stirred, and he stood upright in the air. His blue robe fluttered in the howling wind as he calmly looked up at the Bagua diagram.</p><p></p><p>Under the massive Bagua diagram, Lu Changsheng appeared as small as an ant. But his words shook the heavens and earth: "This petty trick, how dare it show its face!"</p><p></p><p>As soon as he spoke, Lu Changsheng casually pointed a finger. Instantly, a massive, ancient-looking finger appeared before the man in the blue robe, like a towering pillar, and thrust towards the Bagua diagram in the sky.</p><p></p><p>The force was like a primordial beast emerging, vast and unending! </p><p></p><p>Boom!</p><p></p><p>The space shattered, with countless fragments raining down like a torrential downpour.</p><p></p><p>Zhang Shengyu's expression changed drastically, and before he could say anything, the phantom finger collided with his Bagua diagram.</p><p></p><p>Boom!</p><p></p><p>The Yin-Yang Bagua diagram was instantly shattered and destroyed!</p><p></p><p>In the sky, Zhang Shengyu coughed up blood, clutching his chest in staggering shock. But the phantom finger remained unharmed, continuing to surge towards him!</p><p></p><p>At this sight, all present were struck with terror, especially Ye Wutian and the others, who trembled in fear, knowing Zhang Shengyu's death would soon be their own.</p><p></p><p>Just then, a desperate howl echoed through the heavens from Zhang Shengyu:</p><p></p><p>"Heavenly Dao Lord! Where are you?! I am an 8th-stage Saint-Emperor realm expert, a rare powerhouse in the Ancestral Heaven Realm! You cannot allow this outsider, Lu Changsheng, to destroy me!"</p><p></p><p>In that moment, the sky shook violently, dark clouds gathering, lightning flashing, and thunderous roars reverberating. A unique, powerful aura began to permeate the heavens.</p><p></p><p>The assembled experts, including the Heavenly Emperors Yinyao and Xingitian, all had their pupils contract and their pores stand on end, their breathing heavy.</p><p></p><p>Then, the ancient phantom finger mysteriously dissipated. A faint, indifferent voice descended from the heavens:</p><p></p><p>"Lu Changsheng, stand down."</p><p></p><p>This was the voice of the Heavenly Dao, the supreme authority of the Ancestral Heaven Realm! </p><p></p><p>At these words, everyone present, including the Heavenly Emperor Yinyao, immediately knelt in reverence, trembling before the Heavenly Dao's might.</p><p></p><p>Only one figure remained standing tall - Lu Changsheng, his blue robe billowing, his expression no longer the gentle jade, but a profound, unfathomable silence.</p><p></p><p>"This Ancestral Heaven Realm's Heavenly Dao dares to interfere with my affairs..."</p><p></p><p>"Excellent!"</p><p></p><p>As Lu Changsheng's indifferent words echoed through the heavens, everyone was stunned, their scalps tingling with dread.</p>

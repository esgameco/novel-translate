        <h1>Chapter 54</h1>
        <div class="content">
            <p>Here is the full English translation of the Chinese excerpt:</p><p></p><p>The autumn wind was desolate. ‚ôô‚ôú‚ùªÔºô‰∏Ç ∞ùî≤ùìß.ùìí‚ìÑùê¶üêôüëΩ</p><p></p><p>Maoyu Town, the Mansion of the Town Lord.</p><p></p><p>Gu Helin, with a childlike heart, came to the backyard with Lin Dong.</p><p></p><p>They respectfully looked at the figure fishing in the pavilion and called out in unison: "Sir."</p><p></p><p>Lu Changsheng slightly lifted the fishing rod and said softly, "Sit down."</p><p></p><p>"Yes."</p><p></p><p>Gu Helin immediately sat down at the stone table behind Lu Changsheng.</p><p></p><p>As for Tongxin and Lin Dong, they stood obediently behind Gu Helin.</p><p></p><p>It has been eight years since Lin Dong embarked on the path of cultivation. Now, his physique is robust, and his countenance is resolute. Due to his possession of the supreme fire spirit root, his cultivation has reached the peak of Refining Qi at the ninth layer, just one step away from Foundation Establishment.</p><p></p><p>This demonstrates the extraordinary nature of the supreme fire spirit root.</p><p></p><p>As for Tongxin, she has already advanced to the middle stage of Foundation Establishment and is now progressing towards the late stage.</p><p></p><p>However, her appearance still looks youthful, indicating that she has consumed some longevity pills.</p><p></p><p>With Gu Helin, a renowned alchemist as her master, it is not surprising that she can enjoy some rare and precious elixirs.</p><p></p><p>The three of them simultaneously noticed the sleeping old turtle on the stone table.</p><p></p><p>They were not surprised by this, as they had seen it a few times during their previous visits to Lu Changsheng.</p><p></p><p>They thought it was just a new pet that Lu Changsheng had acquired.</p><p></p><p>"Sir, Helin has a premonition that the Tribulation of the Nascent Soul will arrive in the next few days..."</p><p></p><p>Gu Helin looked at Lu Changsheng's back and said respectfully.</p><p></p><p>Tongxin and Lin Dong also looked at this figure with reverence, his demeanor still as impressive as ever.</p><p></p><p>Somehow, whenever they came to this backyard, they felt a sense of security, as if even if the sky were to collapse, there would be no problem.</p><p></p><p>"Are you afraid?" Lu Changsheng asked.</p><p></p><p>"With Sir's protection, Helin is naturally not afraid," Gu Helin quickly replied.</p><p></p><p>Lu Changsheng suddenly released his grip on the fishing rod, leaving it suspended in the air, and then turned to look at Gu Helin.</p><p></p><p>"Facing the Tribulation, which may even lead to your demise, I ask if you are afraid. Do not involve me. If you want a high-quality Nascent Soul, you must overcome the Tribulation on your own."</p><p></p><p>Gu Helin was momentarily stunned. What did this mean? Could it be that the Tribulation could be forcibly interfered with?</p><p></p><p>He then tapped his chest solemnly and said, "Sir, rest assured, Helin has been preparing for this Tribulation for a long time and is not afraid at all!"</p><p></p><p>Lu Changsheng took down the gourd at his waist, took a sip, and said, "In that case, it's good."</p><p></p><p>"Sir, in the next few days, Helin will prepare some formations on the mountain peaks outside the town, waiting for the arrival of the Tribulation."</p><p></p><p>After saying this, Gu Helin stood up, paid his respects, and left with Tongxin and Lin Dong, bowing their heads.</p><p></p><p>"Master, with you present, the Dao of the Spiritual Dust Realm may not dare to bring down the Tribulation," the old turtle on the table said, opening its eyes and smiling.</p><p></p><p>"After passing the Tribulation, that will be the true Nascent Soul. At that time, the Dao of the Spiritual Dust Realm, even if it doesn't want to, will have to bring down the Tribulation," Lu Changsheng said in a soft voice, then turned around and picked up the fishing rod again.</p><p></p><p>The old turtle glanced at Lu Changsheng's back and was about to close its eyes to sleep when it saw a fishing rod growing larger and larger in its vision!</p><p></p><p>"Master, the old turtle was wrong!!"</p><p></p><p>The old turtle was frightened.</p><p></p><p>Boom!</p><p></p><p>Another crack appeared on its shell...</p><p></p><p>Yet the wooden fishing rod remained unharmed.</p><p></p><p>"Ouch," Lu Changsheng said, expressionless, as he retracted the fishing rod, glancing towards the entrance of the town.</p><p></p><p>At the same time, a woman in a black dress with a black veil entered Maoyu Town. She had a very low presence, and people who looked at her would soon forget about her, even though she seemed beautiful and elegant. There was something eerie about her.</p><p></p><p>Jiwuqing looked at the small tavern in front of her and slowly walked towards it. Over the years, she had almost searched the entire Spiritual Dust Cultivation Realm, but she still couldn't find the mysterious cultivator named Lu Changsheng.</p><p></p><p>Finally, she returned to this small town, which was closest to the Immortal Tomb, feeling somewhat disappointed.</p><p></p><p>She didn't know why she had come to this place.</p><p></p><p>New 69 Book Bar ‚Üí 69ùë†‚Ñéùë¢ùë•.ùëêùëúùëö</p><p></p><p>Here is the full English translation of the Chinese excerpt:</p><p></p><p>Fang felt as if an invisible hand was pushing her from behind.</p><p></p><p>"Oh, customer, are you looking to...?" </p><p></p><p>The waiter had not finished speaking when Jiwuqing calmly said, "The air seems to have the scent of peach blossoms, but is it peach blossom wine?"</p><p></p><p>The waiter's face stiffened, and he looked at the woman with disbelief. He was curious - the excellent peach blossom wine had already been carefully stored in the wine cellar by the boss, so how did she detect its scent? He sniffed the air, but could not detect any trace of peach blossoms. Could it be that this woman had a dog's sense of smell?</p><p></p><p>"Customer, I'm sorry, the peach blossom wine has been sold out for some time. If you want to drink it, you'll have to come back next spring when it's available again," the waiter said apologetically.</p><p></p><p>He had been working at the inn for three years, and knew that the boss always stored some peach blossom wine in the cellar, and knew for whom it was reserved.</p><p></p><p>Jiwuqing looked at him inexplicably and said, "If I find that peach blossom wine, this inn will cease to exist."</p><p></p><p>The waiter's heart jumped, and he became alarmed. He could tell that this black-robed, veiled woman had an imposing aura and must be an important person, but...</p><p></p><p>"What's happening?" </p><p></p><p>Zhang Cheng, the boss, came over and asked with a smile after seeing the waiter's expression.</p><p></p><p>The waiter quickly recounted the previous events to the boss.</p><p></p><p>"You go back and attend to the other customers," Zhang Cheng said, raising his brow and apologizing to Jiwuqing. "Miss, your sense of smell is amazing. To be honest, there is still some peach blossom wine stored in the cellar, but we no longer sell it, I'm afraid."</p><p></p><p>"Not selling goods, what kind of logic is that?" Jiwuqing's eyes flashed with cold light, as if she was about to destroy Zhang Cheng the next moment.</p><p></p><p>However, normally the mighty Demon Sovereign would not deign to personally eliminate such insignificant beings. Somehow, Zhang Cheng felt a chill run down his spine, and a sense of fear welled up in his heart. Could it be that this woman was also an immortal?</p><p></p><p>"Miss, the peach blossom wine in the cellar has already been reserved by someone else. I'm really sorry," Zhang Cheng said, already drenched in sweat. His heart was tightly constricted, and he looked at Jiwuqing warily.</p><p></p><p>Hearing this, Jiwuqing looked at the boss with a bit more respect, then casually tossed a gold coin precisely into Zhang Cheng's hand, saying, "Regardless of who has reserved it, I must have that peach blossom wine today."</p><p></p><p>She simply couldn't believe that the mighty Demon Sovereign would be unable to buy a mere peach blossom wine without resorting to force.</p><p></p><p>Zhang Cheng stared blankly at the gold coin in his hand, his heart trembling. A single gold coin could buy enough peach blossom wine for an ordinary person to last a lifetime...</p><p></p><p>Zhang Cheng had never seen anyone casually toss out a gold coin to buy wine - it was simply outrageous.</p><p></p><p>The next moment, Zhang Cheng shakily handed the gold coin back to the bewildered Jiwuqing. "Miss, I'm really sorry..."</p><p></p><p>Jiwuqing's gaze grew colder, and she had completely run out of patience.</p><p></p><p>Just then, a figure in blue robes entered the inn and tossed a gourd to Zhang Cheng, lightly chuckling, "The peach blossom wine, filled to the brim."</p>

        <h1>Chapter 453</h1>
        <div class="content">
            <p>Here is the full English translation of the Chinese excerpt:</p><p></p><p>"So you've only achieved half of it, is it still too early to break through?"</p><p></p><p>Ye Zhui Xing was surprised and puzzled as he asked, "Brother, what do you mean by that?"</p><p></p><p>"I've only just barely stepped into the Divine Realm, isn't that still too early?" Ye Zhui Yue sighed bitterly.</p><p></p><p>Hearing this, Ye Zhui Xing was deeply shaken, and he quickly comforted, "Brother, you're already very strong. Even if you only achieve half the Divine Realm, that is still the Divine Realm, far surpassing the top ancient clans."</p><p></p><p>The Divine Realm was the absolute ruler of the Void Ancient World, even the entire Qian Kun Heavens!</p><p></p><p>Cultivators at the Divine Realm had lifespans exceeding a hundred million years, which was an extremely terrifying milestone.</p><p></p><p>Ye Zhui Yue shook his head, "Zhui Xing, even just half the Divine Realm is as difficult as ascending to the heavens. Do you know how long it took me to reach this point?"</p><p></p><p>Ye Zhui Xing asked, "How long?"</p><p></p><p>Ye Zhui Yue raised three fingers.</p><p></p><p>Ye Zhui Xing said, "Three hundred thousand years? That's quite normal."</p><p></p><p>Ye Zhui Yue shook his head again.</p><p></p><p>Ye Zhui Xing tentatively asked, "Could it be three million years? That's still not too long if you grit your teeth."</p><p></p><p>Ye Zhui Yue replied, "Wrong, it's three million years."</p><p></p><p>What?! Three million years?!</p><p></p><p>Ye Zhui Xing was dumbfounded!</p><p></p><p>Just to reach half the Divine Realm, it was this difficult?</p><p></p><p>Three million years, the world had changed drastically, and for many low-level cultivators, everything would have been long gone.</p><p></p><p>"Haha, so you see, there's no point in discussing this. Perhaps one day an opportunity will arise, but if I follow the rules, it will indeed take around three million years, more or less."</p><p></p><p>Ye Zhui Yue waved his hand and said, "Alright, let's not talk about this anymore."</p><p></p><p>"Brother, you've already reached the threshold of the Divine Realm, surpassing many others. Unlike me, I'm still lost in the dark," Ye Zhui Xing comforted him and prepared to leave.</p><p></p><p>"Hmph, you're so comfortable, managing the Cang Wu Pavilion, lying there half-dead every day. Your life is much easier than mine," Ye Zhui Yue sneered.</p><p></p><p>Ye Zhui Xing's face flushed red, and he felt embarrassed to stay any longer. He bowed and then turned to leave.</p><p></p><p>Just then, he heard Ye Zhui Yue say behind him:</p><p></p><p>"Zhui Xing, when I've finished summarizing my experiences, I'll share the insights I've gained about reaching the Divine Realm threshold with you."</p><p></p><p>Ye Zhui Xing paused.</p><p></p><p>"Thank you, Brother."</p><p></p><p>...</p><p></p><p>At night, the cool wind was blowing.</p><p></p><p>Outside a courtyard, Ye Feng and Ye Xun were whispering to each other when they suddenly noticed Ye Nan Tian's arrival. They immediately greeted him:</p><p></p><p>"Clan Leader (Uncle)."</p><p></p><p>Ye Nan Tian nodded and asked, "Is Elder Lu inside?"</p><p></p><p>Ye Xun replied, "Yes, he is."</p><p></p><p>"Good, you two go to the banquet first. I'll personally invite Elder Lu to join us."</p><p></p><p>Ye Nan Tian waved his hand, dismissing the two. This time, he was determined to create an opportunity to be alone with Elder Lu.</p><p></p><p>"Uh, yes."</p><p></p><p>Ye Feng and Ye Xun responded and then respectfully left.</p><p></p><p>Ye Nan Tian cleared his throat and slightly bowed, calling out:</p><p></p><p>"Elder Lu, the banquet is ready."</p><p></p><p>After a moment, Lu Changsheng walked out of the courtyard and looked at Ye Nan Tian, "Let's go."</p><p></p><p>"Elder Lu, please lead the way," Ye Nan Tian gestured for him to go first and then took the lead, flying ahead.</p><p></p><p>As Ye Nan Tian flew in front, his eyes flashed, and he turned his head with a slight smile, "Elder Lu, what do you think of our Ye Clan?"</p><p></p><p>Lu Changsheng replied without hesitation, "It's just average."</p><p></p><p>Just average?</p><p></p><p>Ye Nan Tian almost stumbled and fell from the sky. After steadying himself, he bitterly smiled and said:</p><p></p><p>"Elder Lu, our Ye Clan is one of the top ancient clans in the Void Ancient World, and you call it just average?"</p><p></p><p>The top ancient clans in the Void Ancient World numbered only around a hundred!</p><p></p><p>Ye Nan Tian didn't realize that Lu Changsheng's "average" was already a relatively positive evaluation.</p><p></p><p>"What are you trying to say?" Lu Changsheng asked, with a hint of a smile on his face.</p><p></p><p>"I... Cough, cough, never mind." Ye Nan Tian was about to say something, but he held back.</p><p></p><p>Here is the full English translation of the Chinese excerpt:</p><p></p><p>Wanting to directly invite Lu Changsheng to be a guest elder of the Ye Clan, but suddenly felt the timing was not right.</p><p></p><p>This kind of invitation should be made after the banquet is over, which would be more appropriate.</p><p></p><p>"Senior Lu, the place ahead is where the evening banquet is being held. At the banquet, they are all the elders of the Ye Clan and the elite disciples."</p><p></p><p>Ye Nantian pointed to a bright area ahead and changed the topic.</p><p></p><p>Lu Changsheng nodded slightly.</p><p></p><p>...</p><p></p><p>After a few breaths, Lu Changsheng followed Ye Nantian into the banquet venue.</p><p></p><p>The elders of the Ye Clan and those elite disciples seemed to have rehearsed in advance, standing up and bowing respectfully:</p><p></p><p>"Welcome, great one, to take your seat."</p><p></p><p>Ye Nantian smiled in satisfaction, as this was his arrangement, and everything was to pave the way for the upcoming invitation.</p><p></p><p>"Senior Lu, please!" Ye Nantian came to a seat and invited.</p><p></p><p>Lu Changsheng shook his head inexplicably, then sat down calmly.</p><p></p><p>And at this moment, two more figures suddenly appeared in the middle of the venue, which were Ye Zhuiyue and Ye Zhuixing.</p><p></p><p>The crowd was momentarily dazed, then panicked and knelt down.</p><p></p><p>"Greet the Patriarch (Elder)!"</p><p></p><p>Everyone in their hearts was very shocked. It turned out that even the Patriarch and the Elder had come!</p><p></p><p>The Patriarch was rarely seen, and the Elder generally did not step out of the Cangwu Pavilion. What happened today?</p><p></p><p>Could it be...</p><p></p><p>The crowd glanced at Lu Changsheng, greatly shocked.</p><p></p><p>"Haha, get up." Ye Zhuiyue waved his hand casually, then turned his gaze to the blue-robed young man sitting there, looked him over for a while, and smiled with a cupped fist:</p><p></p><p>"I am Ye Zhuiyue, the Patriarch of the Ye Clan. I welcome the friend to be a guest in our Ye Clan. The arrival of such a powerful friend like you has brought glory to our Ye Clan."</p><p></p><p>The elders of the Ye Clan and the elite disciples were shocked, but suddenly enlightened, and began to look at the blue-robed young man with reverence.</p><p></p><p>Judging from the Patriarch's demeanor and his words, as well as the tone of addressing the other party, no wonder...</p><p></p><p>It turns out that this person is a great figure, able to receive such treatment, then he must be at least at the middle stage of the Spiritual Void Realm! Amazing!</p><p></p><p>"Uncle Ye, you didn't even tell me that Lord Lu is so powerful." Ye Feng sighed bitterly, not expecting that even the Patriarch would come out.</p><p></p><p>Ye Xunmang looked at the calm and indifferent blue-robed young man, and sighed with difficulty, "You haven't seen the scene of the great one killing the thousand-tentacle demon woman, so you don't understand the terrifying power of the great one."</p><p></p><p>Ye Feng: ...</p><p></p><p>At the same time, Lu Changsheng had no intention of standing up, he just nodded and smiled, "Lu Changsheng."</p><p></p><p>Ye Nantian was a little anxious, feeling that Lu Changsheng's such impolite behavior might offend the Patriarch.</p><p></p><p>But Ye Nantian underestimated Ye Zhuiyue.</p><p></p><p>For a top-tier expert at the Spiritual Void Realm like this to come to their doorstep, even if the other party was arrogant and impolite, Ye Zhuiyue would still think it was no big deal.</p><p></p><p>To get the other party to be a guest elder, they must have the utmost sincerity.</p><p></p><p>"Good name! It's really eye-catching. Old me remembers it!" </p><p></p><p>Ye Zhuiyue smiled, then invited Ye Zhuixing and the others to take their seats. He glanced at the sumptuous dishes, immortal fruits, and fine wines in front of him, and continued:</p><p></p><p>"Friend Lu, please don't disdain the simple tea and plain food."</p><p></p><p>"No problem." Lu Changsheng smiled slightly.</p><p></p><p>"Then let's start the banquet." Ye Zhuiyue called out loudly, then raised his cup and said:</p><p></p><p>"Come, all the people of the Ye Clan, let's toast to Friend Lu together!"</p><p></p><p>The crowd quickly poured wine and raised their cups, toasting towards Lu Changsheng's direction.</p><p></p><p>Lu Changsheng was helpless, since others were so sincere, he naturally wouldn't put on airs, so he lightly raised his wine cup and smiled in acknowledgment.</p><p></p><p>This Ye Clan... is too polite.</p>

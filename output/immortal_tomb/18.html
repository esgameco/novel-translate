        <h1>Chapter 18</h1>
        <div class="content">
            <p>Here is the full English translation of the Chinese excerpt:</p><p></p><p>"Senior, the immortal tomb is just like this. The Crane Forest and even the entire immortal cultivation world only know this much. üê®üçü‚ûÖ‚ùæ≈üùî•·ªÆ‚ìß.Ôº£ùìûùïûüê§üêº"</p><p></p><p>In the cool pavilion in the backyard, the ancient Crane Forest said cautiously.</p><p></p><p>Lu Changsheng did not respond, but stared blankly at the surface of the pond.</p><p></p><p>The specific time of the immortal tomb's appearance is still unknown.</p><p></p><p>According to what the ancient Crane Forest said, the ancient records have a vague record that the immortal tomb has existed in the Spiritual Dust Realm for at least a hundred thousand years...</p><p></p><p>That means, he has been buried for at least a hundred thousand years...</p><p></p><p>And it was a live burial, with his consciousness falling into a deep slumber, and when he wakes up, it would be as if he had just slept for a while.</p><p></p><p>It's just that this "while" is a bit too long, but of course, for him, it's just like that.</p><p></p><p>The legend says that the immortal tomb contains the secret of immortality, but over the countless years, no one in the immortal cultivation world has been able to unravel it.</p><p></p><p>There are even powerful cultivators who want to smash the immortal tomb, but all in vain.</p><p></p><p>As for this, Lu Changsheng, who broke out of the tomb and even erased his own "grave" into nothingness, has a clear gaze.</p><p></p><p>At least a hundred thousand years, so before that...</p><p></p><p>"What happened?" Lu Changsheng murmured to himself.</p><p></p><p>Although Lu Changsheng wants to know, he doesn't have a strong desire to know. If he can know, he would be happy to know, but if he doesn't know, it's not a big deal either.</p><p></p><p>After all, it doesn't seem to have any impact on him?</p><p></p><p>After all, Lu Changsheng himself is immortal, and his personality has become more carefree.</p><p></p><p>Lu Changsheng has had countless friends, and even enemies, disappear in the river of time.</p><p></p><p>Only he, striding through time, transcending the great Dao, roaming freely between heaven and earth.</p><p></p><p>This time after waking up from the immortal tomb, Lu Changsheng even feels that his strength is much stronger than before... It's quite strange.</p><p></p><p>As for the specific extent of this "much stronger", he has no desire to measure it.</p><p></p><p>As for the immortal tomb, he won't think too much about it for now. If he feels like it in the future, he can study it or go and dig it open to explore, or he can go back to the Four Directions Immortal Realm and see if the immortal emperors there are still alive...</p><p></p><p>"Continue."</p><p></p><p>Lu Changsheng said softly.</p><p></p><p>"Uh, Senior, this is all the Spiritual Dust Realm knows about the immortal tomb. Next, should I tell you about the Spiritual Dust Realm?" </p><p></p><p>The ancient Crane Forest asked respectfully.</p><p></p><p>"Mm." Lu Changsheng took a sip of wine.</p><p></p><p>"Yes." The ancient Crane Forest thought about his wording and said,</p><p></p><p>"Senior, the Spiritual Dust Realm is vast but has boundaries, with countless dangerous places and chasms, and ordinary cultivators may not be able to traverse it in their entire lives, and may even lose their lives on the way. The Spiritual Dust Realm is divided into four domains, named conventionally as East, South, West, and North. We are currently in the East Domain."</p><p></p><p>"The four domains are mainly inhabited by commoners, and we cultivators are relatively fewer in number. In fact, cultivators and commoners coexist in the same realm, but countless years ago they were divided into the immortal cultivation world and the mundane world, saying that immortals and mortals are separate. As time has passed, cultivators have rarely engaged in mundane activities."</p><p></p><p>At this point, Lu Changsheng smiled with a hint of playfulness: "Immortals and mortals are separate? Are you little cultivators considered immortals?"</p><p></p><p>"Senior's criticism is correct." The ancient Crane Forest felt a bit embarrassed.</p><p></p><p>The phrase "immortals and mortals are separate" does seem to be a bit... </p><p></p><p>To put it bluntly, it's just the arrogant cultivators in the immortal cultivation world using it to boast about themselves.</p><p></p><p>Beside him, Tongxin heard this and felt a bit gloomy. Although you are powerful, you are not an immortal either!</p><p></p><p>Hearing this, it sounds a bit strange to us little cultivators.</p><p></p><p>Lu Changsheng glanced at Tongxin, but didn't say anything.</p><p></p><p>But this glance made Tongxin shudder with fear!!</p><p></p><p>Here is the full English translation of the Chinese excerpt:</p><p></p><p>How coincidental, it almost feels like he knows what I'm thinking in my heart...</p><p></p><p>New 69 book at 89shu.com</p><p></p><p>It's just an illusion, an illusion, it must be an illusion!</p><p></p><p>"Senior, Helin actually, actually wants to ask, have you been in seclusion for too long and are not familiar with the Lingchen realm anymore...?" </p><p></p><p>Gu Helin couldn't help but ask.</p><p></p><p>"That's right," Lu Changsheng said softly.</p><p></p><p>No wonder...</p><p></p><p>For some reason, Gu Helin let out a long sigh of relief in his heart...</p><p></p><p>And then continued to say,</p><p></p><p>"Senior, in some secret places of our Lingchen realm, there are actually passages leading to the Demon Realm and the Yao Realm... But the Demon Realm and Yao Realm are much smaller compared to our Lingchen realm. Recently, the Black Tongue Demon that has been causing disasters must have come from the Demon Realm, definitely not a native demonic creature of the Lingchen realm!"</p><p></p><p>Lu Changsheng nodded, without saying much, this was not something he was very interested in.</p><p></p><p>"Senior, you don't know, after Helin's observation for some time, we found that these Black Tongue Demons came to Lishui for a purpose, not just to harm the common people!" Gu Helin suddenly said solemnly.</p><p></p><p>The lowered head of Tongxin was startled, and then pricked up his ears to listen.</p><p></p><p>But at the same time, he was a little puzzled, why did the master want to tell this matter to this senior?</p><p></p><p>He hasn't even told him yet...</p><p></p><p>"They may have come for the immortal tombs outside the Lishui Empire!" </p><p></p><p>Gu Helin said in a deep voice.</p><p></p><p>Tongxin was dumbfounded, those demonic creatures came for the immortal tombs? That's impossible, the immortal tombs can't even be explored.</p><p></p><p>Oh? For the immortal tombs?</p><p></p><p>Lu Changsheng's pupils flashed imperceptibly,</p><p></p><p>Now he was a little interested.</p><p></p><p>What? The immortal tombs that no one in the Lingchen realm can explore, do those little demons have a way?</p><p></p><p>Immediately, Gu Helin told Lu Changsheng about the basis of what he had just said.</p><p></p><p>"Senior, what do you think?" Gu Helin looked at him respectfully and asked, a little anxious.</p><p></p><p>Lu Changsheng nodded slightly: "You are quite perceptive."</p><p></p><p>Receiving the praise from the man in front of him, Gu Helin couldn't help but feel a sense of pride in his heart for some reason!</p><p></p><p>He quickly coughed and humbly said with a flushed face: "Senior, you are too kind."</p><p></p><p>"Alright, you can go now."</p><p></p><p>Lu Changsheng placed the wine cup on the table and said.</p><p></p><p>Gu Helin paused, the topic was so abruptly interrupted, this was too sudden, he still had more to say...</p><p></p><p>But he didn't dare to stay any longer, he stood up respectfully and said, "Senior, then we'll take our leave."</p><p></p><p>Lu Changsheng nodded.</p><p></p><p>Seeing this, Gu Helin led Tongxin and turned to leave. Suddenly, he remembered something and quickly turned back, only to find that the young man in blue robes who had been sitting there had disappeared...</p><p></p><p>"Master, the senior came without a trace and left without a trace. Did you forget to ask him something?"</p><p></p><p>Tongxin also looked at the place where Lu Changsheng had been sitting earlier with reverence and asked.</p><p></p><p>Gu Helin said regretfully, "We don't even know the senior's name yet, sigh."</p><p></p><p>Tongxin remained silent.</p><p></p><p>"Lu Changsheng."</p><p></p><p>At this moment, a faint voice sounded in their ears.</p><p></p><p>Gu Helin and Tongxin's pupils shrank, and they looked at each other in shock.</p><p></p><p>Lu Changsheng, his name actually contains the word "Changsheng" (Eternal Life)! This senior surnamed Lu has such a mighty spirit!</p><p></p><p>"Thank you for telling us, Helin... We'll come visit again another day!"</p><p></p><p>Hurriedly saying this, Gu Helin, afraid that Lu Changsheng would refuse, quickly pulled the bewildered Tongxin and fled towards the sky!</p><p></p><p>At this time, Lu Changsheng in the room was looking out the window, in the direction of the immortal tombs on the mountain.</p><p></p><p>"Interesting."</p>

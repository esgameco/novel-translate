        <h1>Chapter 229</h1>
        <div class="content">
            <p>Here is the full English translation of the Chinese excerpt:</p><p></p><p>The little girl nodded seriously. ‚Äî(‚Ä¢‚Ä¢√∑[ ‚ùª‚ûàùïä‚Ñçùïå·ô≠.œÇÔΩèùêå ]√∑‚Ä¢‚Ä¢)‚Äî</p><p></p><p>The boy had some doubts in his heart. Could it be that she couldn't speak?</p><p></p><p>He hadn't noticed just now that the street had become a bit quieter since the little girl came out.</p><p></p><p>But soon, various discussions arose,</p><p></p><p>"Little doctor, please don't take offense, Tong'er has been mute since birth, but she is absolutely skilled with her hands."</p><p></p><p>"Yes, poor Tong'er is a pitiful child, she has been an orphan since childhood, and has been raised by eating at various households in our Yanyu Town."</p><p></p><p>"Normally, Tong'er doesn't just eat and drink for free either, wherever there is work, she will help. Don't be fooled by her small size, she is much more capable than my useless son!"</p><p></p><p>"......"</p><p></p><p>Listening to these words, the boy looked at the little girl in front of him with a bit of surprise, and couldn't help but feel pity in his heart.</p><p></p><p>So young, but indeed well-behaved.</p><p></p><p>It's just that not being able to speak... will be a bit troublesome.</p><p></p><p>When the time comes for this little girl to work as a pharmacy apprentice in the clinic, she will certainly need to communicate with the doctor. Ah... it will be difficult.</p><p></p><p>Hey, wait a minute, the doctor's medical skills are so superb, treating a mute person should be a piece of cake, right??</p><p></p><p>The boy suddenly realized, and slapped his own head hard.</p><p></p><p>He had fallen into a dead end again.</p><p></p><p>"Okay, then it's you. Do you want to prepare anything? Or shall we go back to the clinic right away?" the boy asked the little girl.</p><p></p><p>The little girl shook her head.</p><p></p><p>Seeing this, the boy understood, and without further words, turned and took a step forward, "Come back to the clinic with me."</p><p></p><p>The little girl was delighted, and quickly followed.</p><p></p><p>Her thoughts were simple, she just wanted to learn some medical skills, in order to repay the grandparents, aunts and uncles in the town.</p><p></p><p>The people on the street all looked at the little girl leaving with the boy with smiles on their faces, without any dissatisfaction, but rather genuine happiness.</p><p></p><p>They all knew that becoming a pharmacy apprentice in the Changsheng Clinic was a rare opportunity.</p><p></p><p>Everyone wanted to send their own children there.</p><p></p><p>But for the beloved Tong'er of Yanyu Town, it didn't matter.</p><p></p><p>Being in a remote place, kindness and goodness had long been ingrained in their bones.</p><p></p><p>And they truly cherished this unfortunate but sunny and optimistic little girl.</p><p></p><p>.........</p><p></p><p>Changsheng Clinic.</p><p></p><p>Lu Changsheng seriously looked at the book in his hand, when suddenly a knocking sound came from outside the courtyard.</p><p></p><p>Knock, knock, knock.</p><p></p><p>He was not surprised at all, closing the book and softly saying, "Come in."</p><p></p><p>Soon, a furtive and sneaky old man entered the clinic.</p><p></p><p>Seeing that Lu Changsheng was the only one in the clinic, the old man heaved a sigh of relief.</p><p></p><p>Lu Changsheng looked at the old man in front of him with interest,</p><p></p><p>This old man was none other than the owner of the steamed bun stall from yesterday.</p><p></p><p>"Old man, have a seat," Lu Changsheng smiled.</p><p></p><p>"Hehe, Doctor Lu, I'll just stand, just stand." Luo Gu rubbed his hands, laughing awkwardly, "Doctor Lu, yesterday when you bought steamed buns from my small stall, if I had known it was you, I wouldn't have dared to take your money."</p><p></p><p>Saying that, he took a handful of copper coins from his pocket, picked out ten, and placed them on the table.</p><p></p><p>Lu Changsheng chuckled, gently waving his hand, and the copper coins flew back into Luo Gu's pocket. He said, "No need, a deal is a deal. Don't worry, I won't refuse to treat you because of this."</p><p></p><p>Luo Gu was surprised, but not overly shocked, and soon bowed slightly and sighed, "I didn't expect Doctor Lu to be a cultivator, the cultivators in our Yanyu Town are really rare!"</p><p></p><p>Lu Changsheng shook his head, tapping his fingers lightly on the table, and smiled, "Old man, you've come to my clinic to seek medical treatment, so why don't you tell me about it?"</p><p></p><p>Seeing Lu Changsheng directly bring up the main topic, Luo Gu's face turned from red to purple, finding it somewhat difficult to speak.</p><p></p><p>Lu Changsheng was in no hurry, pouring him a cup of hot tea, and then quietly sipping tea and reading his book, with a faint smile on his lips.</p><p></p><p>Luo Gu glimpsed the inexplicable smile on the corner of Lu Changsheng's mouth, and his heart suddenly jumped. He blushed, unable to help but suspect that Doctor Lu might have known the embarrassing purpose of his visit to the clinic.</p><p></p><p>Oh well!</p><p></p><p>Glancing out the door, afraid that someone might come later, Luo Gu cleared his throat and said in a low voice,</p><p></p><p>"Cough, Doctor Lu, how should I put this, I, the old man, have a..."</p><p></p><p>Here is the full English translation of the excerpt from the Chinese novel:</p><p></p><p>"Friend, his, that's not really an illness, not really an illness," said the man.</p><p></p><p>"Tell me what symptoms your friend has, so I can prescribe the right medicine," said Lu Changsheng, intently flipping through the book in his hands.</p><p></p><p>Luo Gu's face flushed, and he mumbled, "My friend, well, he's getting on in years... He said that area of his has become a bit limp."</p><p></p><p>"Which area?" Lu Changsheng looked up and scanned him.</p><p></p><p>Luo Gu gritted his teeth and gestured downwards.</p><p></p><p>Lu Changsheng seemed to suddenly understand, and smiled, "Ah, I see, that area."</p><p></p><p>For some reason, seeing Dr. Lu's smile, Luo Gu felt humiliated.</p><p></p><p>He pouted his lips, feeling a bit aggrieved.</p><p></p><p>"Tell your friend not to worry too much, it's normal as one gets older," Lu Changsheng comforted gently.</p><p></p><p>Luo Gu became anxious and said, "Dr. Lu, I know it's normal for an old man, but you don't know, when I was young, my friend was quite vigorous! But now he can only sigh wistfully, my friend is not content with this!"</p><p></p><p>Originally Luo Gu was already a bit discontented, but he could still control it. But today, the words of the Spring Fragrance Pavilion madam and the teasing of the group had pierced his heart like sharp needles!</p><p></p><p>He swore, he would rise up!</p><p></p><p>Seeing Lu Changsheng not speaking, Luo Gu grew anxious, and pleaded closely, "Dr. Lu, you must help... that friend of mine, from now on, as long as you come to my steamed bun shop to eat buns, they'll all be free!"</p><p></p><p>Lu Changsheng looked at him and smiled, "You and your friend have a really good relationship."</p><p></p><p>Luo Gu laughed awkwardly, "Like brothers."</p><p></p><p>Lu Changsheng rose and went to the counter, spreading out a piece of mulberry paper. Then his mind moved slightly.</p><p></p><p>Tap, tap, tap...</p><p></p><p>The herb cabinet behind the counter opened a few compartments, and some herbs were neatly and precisely placed on the mulberry paper.</p><p></p><p>After that, Lu Changsheng wrapped up the herbs in the mulberry paper, while saying, "When you get home, first soak the herbs in cold water for a quarter of an hour, then start a fire to decoct them. After the pot comes to a boil, reduce the heat and continue decocting for another quarter of an hour. When the time is up, pour out the medicinal soup, understand?"</p><p></p><p>As he finished speaking, Lu Changsheng had just finished the packaging. He handed the medicine packet to the excited Luo Gu.</p><p></p><p>Luo Gu took the medicine packet, his tone resolute, "Dr. Lu, don't worry, I will carefully tell my friend the steps for decocting the medicine!"</p><p></p><p>Lu Changsheng smiled meaningfully, "This medicine can be decocted twice, but... tell your friend, one dose is enough, if he drinks a second dose, it may be harmful to his body..."</p><p></p><p>Luo Gu solemnly said, "Dr. Lu, don't worry!"</p><p></p><p>It's unknown whether he really heard and understood.</p><p></p><p>"Twenty copper coins," Lu Changsheng said, extending his palm.</p><p></p><p>Huh? So cheap? He could earn it back by selling forty steamed buns.</p><p></p><p>But then he remembered the rumors about the Chen family on the street today, and felt relieved.</p><p></p><p>Dr. Lu really is a great doctor...</p><p></p><p>Luo Gu hurriedly took out twenty copper coins and handed them to Lu Changsheng, while still feeling a bit uneasy and asking, "Dr. Lu, how effective is this medicine? For my friend, this is of utmost importance!"</p><p></p><p>Lu Changsheng took the copper coins and placed them on the counter, smiling, "Don't worry, as a product of Changsheng Medical Hall, it is of the finest quality."</p><p></p><p>Luo Gu felt relieved, then awkwardly smiled at Lu Changsheng and bid farewell before leaving.</p><p></p><p>At this time, Tong Xin came in, and he puzzledly looked at Luo Gu, "Oh, the steamed bun shop owner, are you ill?"</p><p></p><p>Luo Gu was startled, his face flushing red, stammering, "Tong Xin, it's not me, it's my friend, my friend."</p><p></p><p>Saying that, he hurried out in a flurry.</p><p></p><p>Tong Xin was perplexed and bewildered.</p><p></p><p>He then bowed and said, "Sir, I've called the apprentice."</p><p></p><p>Seeing Lu Changsheng nod, Tong Xin called out, "Xiao Tong, come in."</p><p></p><p>Soon, a timid little girl walked in with her head lowered.</p><p></p><p>Lu Changsheng quietly looked at the little girl and gently said, "Raise your head."</p><p></p><p>The girl furrowed her brow, why did this soothing voice... feel somewhat familiar?</p><p></p><p>She slowly lifted her head and looked at the young man standing behind the counter, her black eyes suddenly becoming hazy.</p>

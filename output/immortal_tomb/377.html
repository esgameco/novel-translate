        <h1>Chapter 377</h1>
        <div class="content">
            <p>Here is the full English translation of the Chinese excerpt:</p><p></p><p>Hearing the order of the Sword Sovereign, the divine and mysterious beings above the four Overlords, including Jiang Wuxin, immediately set out. They one after another passed through the teleportation array and rushed towards the direction of the Heavenly City.</p><p></p><p>The myriad tribes must have gathered in the area outside the Heavenly City. </p><p></p><p>After all, the Heavenly City is the core of the human race, as is widely known.</p><p></p><p>As for the Human City and the Earth City, there's no hurry. At most, there are just some minor tribes outside. Even if a battle breaks out, the defensive arrays around the cities will give them enough time to return.</p><p></p><p>Of course, even if a battle does break out, the human race has no chance of winning...</p><p></p><p>They must go to the Heavenly City and fight alongside the Sword Sovereign.</p><p></p><p>Otherwise, the Sword Sovereign alone would not be able to withstand the immense pressure.</p><p></p><p>...</p><p></p><p>Outside the human territories, a vast array of alien tribes stood, in various forms, as far as the eye could see, their numbers impossible to estimate.</p><p></p><p>Zi Xuanyong, Xue Yueyu and others had long since led their tribes to this place. They exchanged knowing glances.</p><p></p><p>If one were to say that these myriad tribes had gathered for the Jade Heart in the hands of the human race, then they were here to witness the downfall of Jiang Wuxin and the Savage Heavenly, to witness the annihilation of the human race.</p><p></p><p>Once the human race is destroyed, the Eternal Life Beings, apart from them, would have no one else who knows of their existence.</p><p></p><p>At the very forefront were the Top 100 Tribes, and at the lead were the Ten Apex Tribes.</p><p></p><p>The ones who had come from the Ten Apex Tribes were still the Divine Son Shenlo, as well as the Holy Son and Holy Daughters like Bi Qiong and Ao Xing. </p><p></p><p>The difference this time was that by their sides stood elders of their respective tribes.</p><p></p><p>At this moment, the peripheral vision of all the tribes was focused on the Ten Apex Tribes, one could say they were waiting for their cue.</p><p></p><p>As soon as the Top Ten Apex Tribes gave the order, they would rise up in arms and invade the human territories!</p><p></p><p>Then, in the center of the Apex Tribes at the very front, Shenlo glanced at Bi Qiong, Ao Xing and the others.</p><p></p><p>Bi Qiong and Ao Xing immediately understood, this was Shenlo seeking their opinion, which could also be seen as a gesture of courtesy.</p><p></p><p>Ao Xing smiled faintly and said, "Divine Son, please proceed."</p><p></p><p>Bi Qiong also said, "Shenlo, then you decide."</p><p></p><p>Shenlo nodded lightly, then turned his head and softly chuckled, "Uncle Wei, thank you for the trouble."</p><p></p><p>"Divine Son, you are too polite," a middle-aged man with a pair of white light wings standing beside Shenlo slightly bowed.</p><p></p><p>Then, under the gaze of all, he flashed to the forefront of the high sky.</p><p></p><p>Those great wings emanated a sacred light, even amidst the haze of war!</p><p></p><p>Seeing this person, all the tribes present felt a chill in their hearts!</p><p></p><p>The Heavenly God Tribe, Divine Might!!</p><p></p><p>Position, the Third Divine Official!</p><p></p><p>The Fifth Divine Official was already at the supreme core of the Heavenly God Tribe!</p><p></p><p>After the Heavenly God Sovereign, the First Divine Official, and the Second Divine Official, came this Third Divine Official!</p><p></p><p>A position like the Third Divine Official, even the Divine Son Shenlo himself had to be courteous when facing him.</p><p></p><p>And this Third Divine Official was also a powerhouse on the Individual Combat Strength Ranking, and his ranking was not low, at the 36th place!</p><p></p><p>In the entire Divine-Demon Battlefield, among the countless billions of alien tribes, there was not a single simple individual among those ranked in the top hundred.</p><p></p><p>To put it this way, the Individual Combat Strength Ranking had a total of one hundred places, and the Heavenly God Tribe alone occupied five of them!</p><p></p><p>Respectively, the Heavenly God Sovereign, the First, Second, and Third Divine Officials, as well as Shenlo, the Divine Son.</p><p></p><p>The Top 100 Tribes did not all have an ultra-powerful expert who could rank on the Individual Combat Strength Ranking.</p><p></p><p>So one can imagine, the Heavenly God Tribe being able to monopolize five spots on the Individual Combat Strength Ranking, that was how domineering they were.</p><p></p><p>Even the Devouring Beast Tribe and the Dragon Tribe, which were apex tribes, at most only had two spots on the Individual Combat Strength Ranking.</p><p></p><p>So on the Individual Combat Strength Ranking, just the top ten apex tribes alone occupied nearly twenty spots!</p><p></p><p>...</p><p></p><p>Under the gaze of all, the Divine Might looked at the human territories ahead and indifferently said:</p><p></p><p>"Sword Sovereign Mie Tian, come out."</p><p></p><p>The only one in the human race who was ranked on the list was Jian Wuhui.</p><p></p><p>Here is the full English translation of the Chinese excerpt:</p><p></p><p>"He was not worthy to speak with him.</p><p></p><p>The new 69 book bar 99shuxia.com</p><p></p><p>At the same time,</p><p></p><p>The words of the Mighty Deity echoed throughout the entire human domain like the voice of a god!</p><p></p><p>Immediately, the hearts of all the humans were filled with anxiety, and countless cultivators flew out of the Three Cities, trembling as they gazed at the distant war mist.</p><p></p><p>The crowd could vaguely see the massive figures like an ocean within the war mist!</p><p></p><p>The myriad tribes had descended!</p><p></p><p>"Esteemed ones, you have mustered such a grand force and descended upon the human domain, we humans are deeply honored," </p><p></p><p>At this moment, the steady voice of Jian Wuhuai rose, slightly calming the anxiety in everyone's hearts.</p><p></p><p>Their task now was to quietly observe and wait.</p><p></p><p>...</p><p></p><p>Outside the human domain.</p><p></p><p>Jian Wuhuai led the powerful humans and stood facing the myriad tribes.</p><p></p><p>Seeing the human crowd, the myriad tribes' eyes gleamed with excitement and eagerness!</p><p></p><p>After all, all the Colored Jade Pearls of the current Colored Jade Pagoda were in the hands of Jian Wuhuai and the others!</p><p></p><p>Meanwhile, Zi Xuanyong, Xue Yueyu, and others were intently watching Jiang Wuxin and Man Tian...</p><p></p><p>At this time, Jian Wuhuai and the others swept their gaze around, finally looking towards the Ten Apex Great Clans, their eyes filled with grave solemnity.</p><p></p><p>The Godly Deity Clan's Prince Shenlo, the Third Divine Official Shenwei.</p><p></p><p>The Holy Son of the Devouring Beast Clan Biqiong, the Holy Son of the Dragon Clan Aoxi, and so on, each accompanied by an Elder-level expert...</p><p></p><p>The lineup of the myriad tribes was truly terrifying. If a conflict were to truly erupt, the human side might not be able to withstand even a single exchange...</p><p></p><p>Shenwei casually glanced at Jiang Wuxin and the others, then fixed his gaze on the leading Jian Wuhuai, saying indifferently:</p><p></p><p>"Extermination Sword Venerable, in this Colored Jade Pagoda, your human domain has sneakily and deceptively passed through and seized all the Colored Jade Pearls... What crime shall your human domain be charged with?"</p><p></p><p>Jian Wuhuai waved his sleeve and smiled lightly:</p><p></p><p>"As the Third Divine Official has said, this Venerable One understands. So, how does the Third Divine Official intend to proceed?"</p><p></p><p>Countless foreign tribes listening to the dialogue between Shenwei and Jian Wuhuai, seeing Jian Wuhuai's calm and unperturbed demeanor, all sighed inwardly. Setting aside other matters, to remain so composed in the face of the myriad tribes, Jian Wuhuai truly lived up to the title of Extermination Sword Venerable.</p><p></p><p>Shenwei's eyes narrowed slightly as he asked, "How many Colored Jade Pearls did your human domain collect in total?"</p><p></p><p>Upon hearing this, Jiang Wuxin, Han Jinlong, and the others felt a chill in their hearts.</p><p></p><p>Jian Wuhuai's eyes flickered slightly before he replied in a steady voice, "This time, our human domain collected a total of exactly 10,000 Colored Jade Pearls."</p><p></p><p>10,000!</p><p></p><p>The myriad tribes were shaken, and numerous discussions erupted:</p><p></p><p>"Whew, 10,000 pearls, the Colored Jade Pearls of this session are actually so many? The previous session only had around 8,000 in total, right?"</p><p></p><p>"Yes, 10,000 pearls, tsk tsk, if handled properly, that could create nearly 10,000 Mystic Celestial Realm experts."</p><p></p><p>"With so many Colored Jade Pearls, it seems to be true, and the humans are about to be exterminated, so they have no need to lie."</p><p></p><p>"..."</p><p></p><p>At this moment, Shenwei suddenly raised his hand!</p><p></p><p>The scene immediately fell silent.</p><p></p><p>Shenwei stared at Jian Wuhuai from afar and coldly said, "Quickly hand over the Colored Jade Pearls, and perhaps today we can still leave some seedlings for your human domain..."</p><p></p><p>Jian Wuhuai, however, smiled and said, "The Colored Jade Pearls have already been hidden by this Venerable One in a concealed place. If you dare to act rashly, then this Venerable One will destroy all the Colored Jade Pearls, and none of your tribes will be able to obtain them."</p><p></p><p>Hearing this, the eyes of all the myriad tribe members shrank!</p><p></p><p>Shenwei immediately roared, "Extermination Sword Venerable, are you not afraid of getting your tongue twisted by speaking such big words? The Colored Jade Pearls, as the products of the Colored Jade Pagoda, are self-contained and extremely hard. Do you really think you can destroy them?"</p><p></p><p>Jian Wuhuai let out a cold laugh, and a sharp sword qi shot towards the heavens!</p><p></p><p>"Third Divine Official, don't worry about whether this Venerable One is speaking big words or not. Let me ask you one thing, do you dare to bet?"</p>

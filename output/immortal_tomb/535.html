        <h1>Chapter 535</h1>
        <div class="content">
            <p>Here is the full English translation of the Chinese excerpt:</p><p></p><p>"Of course, this statement from the teacher reveals many things!" </p><p></p><p>"Teacher, student...!" </p><p></p><p>Xiao Fan's eyes were filled with determination - he wanted to lie down and become stronger first!</p><p></p><p>"You sit down first." Lu Changsheng gestured with his hand.</p><p></p><p>"Yes." Xiao Fan quickly sat down, looking at Lu Changsheng with admiration and hope.</p><p></p><p>Lu Changsheng held a ruler, gently swinging it. "You all only know that to become a book cultivator, you must receive the blessings of the Heavenly and Earthly Sages. But do you know who the Heavenly and Earthly Sages of the Book-Martial Mysterious Heaven are?"</p><p></p><p>Book-Martial Mysterious Heaven?</p><p></p><p>The three of Han Yue were puzzled, but at the moment they had no time to think much about it, assuming the teacher had misspoke.</p><p></p><p>They hurriedly said in unison:</p><p></p><p>"The three Heavenly and Earthly Sages are Master Lu, Master Mo, and Master Zui!"</p><p></p><p>These three masters are the Heavenly and Earthly Sages, revered as saints in the Book-Martial Mysterious Heaven, known to all.</p><p></p><p>Throughout the ages, only these three masters have left their names for eternity, receiving countless worships from book cultivators.</p><p></p><p>Of the three masters, Master Lu and Master Mo have long since passed away, but it is rumored that they did not enter the cycle of reincarnation, but instead merged into the Book-Martial Mysterious Heaven, becoming the guardians of its Heavenly and Earthly will.</p><p></p><p>As for Master Zui, he still lives in this world! He is the only remaining Heavenly and Earthly Sage, a true living fossil!</p><p></p><p>But no one knows where Master Zui is, nor has anyone ever claimed to have seen him.</p><p></p><p>"Correct, Lu Yi, Mo Ran, Zui Qiancheng, these three are the Heavenly and Earthly Sages," Lu Changsheng said with a slight smile.</p><p></p><p>Lu Yi? Mo Ran? Zui Qiancheng?</p><p></p><p>The three of Han Yue stared at Lu Changsheng, their expressions turning to shock as they realized.</p><p></p><p>Could these be the real names of the three Heavenly and Earthly Sages?</p><p></p><p>This was the first time they had ever heard of these names!</p><p></p><p>The world only knew the surnames of the masters, not their given names.</p><p></p><p>How did the teacher know?</p><p></p><p>The three of Han Yue were shaken, but they did not believe the teacher was lying.</p><p></p><p>Just who is this teacher...?</p><p></p><p>The next moment, Lu Changsheng calmly said, "Lu Yi, Mo Ran, come see me."</p><p></p><p>The three of Han Yue looked at Lu Changsheng blankly...</p><p></p><p>Boom!!</p><p></p><p>Suddenly, a thunderclap burst from the clear sky, startling the three of Han Yue and all the residents of Jixiang Town.</p><p></p><p>Not only them, but all the townspeople were shocked by the sudden thunderclap in the bright, sunny sky!</p><p></p><p>The townspeople looked up at the sky in bewilderment, soon realizing with astonishment that there were flashes of light between the clouds!</p><p></p><p>Two massive shadowy figures were gradually taking shape!</p><p></p><p>The townspeople snapped out of their daze, falling to their knees in worship. The Heavenly Sages have manifested! This must be an auspicious omen!</p><p></p><p>But the next moment, the two forming figures suddenly dissipated and vanished without a trace!</p><p></p><p>Huh?</p><p></p><p>The townspeople were perplexed, what just happened?</p><p></p><p>The sky returned to calm, and the people wondered if they had just imagined the whole thing in broad daylight.</p><p></p><p>...</p><p></p><p>Meanwhile, in the Long Life Academy.</p><p></p><p>The three of Han Yue stared dumbfoundedly at the scene before them.</p><p></p><p>Two scholarly-looking ethereal figures were bowing respectfully before Lu Changsheng.</p><p></p><p>The three snapped out of their daze, their faces turning deathly pale, their bodies trembling.</p><p></p><p>They were terrified!</p><p></p><p>These two ethereal Confucian-aura elders, could they be the legendary Master Lu and Master Mo?!</p><p></p><p>This, this, this...!</p><p></p><p>Until the voices of the two ethereal elders rang out, the three of Han Yue were stunned, like wooden chickens.</p><p></p><p>"Lu Yi, Mo Ran, greet Master Lu."</p><p></p><p>Lu Changsheng said indifferently, "You came so quietly. If I hadn't stopped you, how much commotion were you planning to make?"</p><p></p><p>"Hehe..." Lu Yi and Mo Ran chuckled awkwardly, clearly embarrassed.</p><p></p><p>They did not know where Lu Changsheng came from, they only knew that on that day, this person before them had effortlessly communicated with the Heavenly and Earthly will, becoming the greatest book cultivator in the history of the Book-Martial Mysterious Heaven.</p><p></p><p>Here is the full English translation of the Chinese excerpt:</p><p></p><p>The Strongest of the Dao.</p><p></p><p>That level of achievement even shocked the two Heavenly and Earthly Saints.</p><p></p><p>Zui Chencheng's whereabouts were unknown, but he must have sensed it as well.</p><p></p><p>Although the one before them had suppressed the heavenly and earthly anomalies at the time, as the leader of the three Heavenly and Earthly Saints, Zui Chencheng must have perceived it.</p><p></p><p>"Enough with the idle chatter, these three are my students, you two go and bestow the crown upon them."</p><p></p><p>Lu Changsheng pointed to Han Yue and the other two, instructing them.</p><p></p><p>Huh?</p><p></p><p>Lu Yi and Mo Ran looked at each other in confusion, was the Master calling them over just for this small matter?</p><p></p><p>They were puzzled, since they were the Master's students, why didn't the Master bestow the crown himself...</p><p></p><p>The Master's crown bestowal would be far superior to theirs.</p><p></p><p>Sensing their confusion, Lu Changsheng did not explain.</p><p></p><p>Although he was the strongest in the Dao, he was not a person of the Book, Martial, and Mysterious Heavens.</p><p></p><p>It was not appropriate for him to bestow the crown upon Han Yue and the others who were born and raised in the Book, Martial, and Mysterious Heavens.</p><p></p><p>"Yes, Master," Lu Yi and Mo Ran bowed slightly and turned to look at the three young ones, their eyes filled with admiration and awe.</p><p></p><p>These three young ones were truly blessed, to actually become the Master's students.</p><p></p><p>The two then exchanged a glance and successively extended their illusory hands, gently patting the heads of Han Yue and the others, and a wisp of misty breath entered the bodies of the three.</p><p></p><p>Having done so, Lu Yi and Mo Ran turned back, "Master, then we shall take our leave."</p><p></p><p>Lu Changsheng nodded slightly, his gaze calmly watching as the illusory figures of Lu Yi and Mo Ran gradually dissipated.</p><p></p><p>At this time, Han Yue and the other two were still in a dazed state, not even aware that they had been crowned by the Heavenly and Earthly Saints.</p><p></p><p>"Ahem."</p><p></p><p>Lu Changsheng cleared his throat, causing the three to regain their senses, and then smiled, "Alright, you have now been crowned by the Heavenly and Earthly Saints, from now on you will be Dao cultivators, isn't that easy?"</p><p></p><p>At this moment, Han Yue, Ye Xiaoxiao, and Xiao Fan's chests were heaving, their small faces flushed red, their spiritual souls trembling, and they dared not look directly at their Master!</p><p></p><p>The Master actually summoned Master Lu and Master Mo!!!! </p><p></p><p>And ordered Master Lu and Master Mo to personally bestow the crown upon them!!!!</p><p></p><p>Han Yue and the other two did not know how other people were crowned when they became Dao cultivators, but it was definitely not like them!!  Too dramatic!!</p><p></p><p>Heavens!!</p><p></p><p>And Han Yue and the others could see that in front of the Master, Master Lu and Master Mo were as respectful as students!!!! </p><p></p><p>Those were the Heavenly and Earthly Saints of the Book, Martial, and Mysterious Heavens, revered by countless Dao cultivators throughout the ages!!!</p><p></p><p>Then, just who was their Master?!!</p><p></p><p>The more Han Yue and the others thought about it, the more confused and alarmed their minds became!</p><p></p><p>Their faces went from flushed red to deathly pale!</p><p></p><p>It must be a dream, yes, they must be dreaming!!</p><p></p><p>Lu Changsheng's brow furrowed slightly as he calmly said, "Calm down."</p><p></p><p>These two words seemed to have a magical power, instantly soothing the various emotions of Han Yue and the other two.</p><p></p><p>Han Yue and the others took a deep breath, bowing ninety degrees, their tone more respectful than ever, "Yes... yes, Master."</p><p></p><p>They dared not ask or say anything. At this moment, they were not even excited about becoming Dao cultivators, their hearts were filled with nothing but the mystery and greatness of their Master!</p><p></p><p>They couldn't help but think that they must have accumulated merits over countless lifetimes to have the great fortune of entering their Master's door!</p><p></p><p>Their decision to refuse to join the Tian Wu Sect must have been the most correct decision of their lives!</p><p></p><p>Han Yue and the others couldn't help but think of Huang Xuan and the other twelve students who joined the Tian Wu Sect...</p><p></p><p>They couldn't help but sigh inwardly!</p>

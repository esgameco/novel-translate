        <h1>Chapter 134</h1>
        <div class="content">
            <p>Here is the full English translation of the Chinese excerpt:</p><p></p><p>The howling wind whistled. üëªüê∏6‚ûàùî∞ƒ§ùêÆ–ñ.ƒÜ·óù‚ìÇ‚ô®üêØ</p><p></p><p>Luchang Sheng stood with his hands behind his back, gazing into the vast sky, silent.</p><p></p><p>Nangong Jing respectfully stood behind him.</p><p></p><p>His eyes flickered slightly, as Luchang Sheng had not moved or spoken for a while.</p><p></p><p>He was somewhat perplexed.</p><p></p><p>But the next moment, Nangong Jing's eyes suddenly widened!</p><p></p><p>He saw a towering, illusory figure slowly coalescing in front of them...</p><p></p><p>"Immortal Emperor Changsheng."</p><p></p><p>A hollow, ancient voice sounded in his ears.</p><p></p><p>Nangong Jing knew that this voice was coming from the towering illusory figure.</p><p></p><p>Could this be...</p><p></p><p>He looked at the towering illusory figure with a hint of disbelief.</p><p></p><p>Luchang Sheng said directly, "Return to him the lifespan you took when he peeked into the Heavenly Secrets."</p><p></p><p>Seeing Luchang Sheng's directness, the towering illusory figure seemed to fall silent for a moment.</p><p></p><p>After a while, it said, "Immortal Emperor Changsheng, peeking into the Heavenly Secrets always comes at a price..."</p><p></p><p>Luchang Sheng waved his sleeve lightly and said calmly, "I am currently serving as the Immortal Emperor in the Central Immortal Realm. Nangong Jing's peeking into the Heavenly Secrets can be seen as indirectly helping me. Since I have said so, do you understand?"</p><p></p><p>The towering illusory figure wavered for a moment, then finally said, "Alright, I'll do this favor for the Immortal Emperor Changsheng... But once he breaks through to the Immortal Emperor realm, this lifespan..."</p><p></p><p>Luchang Sheng smiled and said, "Once Nangong Jing breaks through to the Immortal Emperor realm, you can naturally take back this lifespan."</p><p></p><p>Nangong Jing was stunned.</p><p></p><p>So it could be done this way... How is this any different from cheating?</p><p></p><p>When he becomes an Immortal Emperor, his lifespan will increase greatly, and the portion returned will be insignificant.</p><p></p><p>"Then go ahead and return the lifespan to him," Luchang Sheng said calmly.</p><p></p><p>The towering illusory figure nodded, and Nangong Jing suddenly felt an extremely powerful surge of vital energy flooding his body, reviving all the exhaustion within him.</p><p></p><p>"Thank you, Immortal Emperor Changsheng, thank you, Heavenly Dao..."</p><p></p><p>Nangong Jing bowed gratefully.</p><p></p><p>The towering illusory figure did not pay attention to Nangong Jing, but looked at Luchang Sheng and said hesitantly, "Immortal Emperor Changsheng, there is a huge breach in the barrier of one of the Four Realms..."</p><p></p><p>Luchang Sheng's eyes flashed, knowing that it was caused by the punch he had thrown in the Southern Immortal Realm, and he smiled, "What do you mean?"</p><p></p><p>The towering illusory figure paused, then gradually faded away...</p><p></p><p>"Nothing... I just hope that in the future, Immortal Emperor Changsheng will be a little more restrained. The Four Realms cannot withstand such turbulence from you. If you were to throw a few more punches, the Four Realms might be riddled with holes, and it would be a hassle for me to repair them."</p><p></p><p>Nangong Jing heard this with great shock, but the next moment, his vision went dark.</p><p></p><p>When his sight returned, he was back in the Dao Sect.</p><p></p><p>"You may leave. I need to rest."</p><p></p><p>Luchang Sheng said and walked inside.</p><p></p><p>"Yes..."</p><p></p><p>Nangong Jing took a deep look at Luchang Sheng's retreating back, bowed respectfully, and turned to leave the courtyard. He was deeply shaken.</p><p></p><p>The Heavenly Dao of the Four Realms seemed to cower before Immortal Emperor Changsheng. At this point, even if someone said Luchang Sheng was the father of the Heavenly Dao, Nangong Jing would be willing to believe it.</p><p></p><p>Especially the Heavenly Dao's last few words, they were truly shocking.</p><p></p><p>What did it mean by "a few more punches" and the Four Realms would be "riddled with holes"? This was too terrifying.</p><p></p><p>Here is the full English translation of the Chinese excerpt:</p><p></p><p>However, Nangong Jing knew that at the level of the Heavenly Dao, there would be no frivolous jokes...</p><p></p><p>The Immortal Emperor of Longevity was truly unfathomable.</p><p></p><p>New 69 Book Bar ‚Üí 69shu.com</p><p></p><p>...</p><p></p><p>Langtian Domain, Bai Yue Sect.</p><p></p><p>"Senior Brother Gu, what's wrong with you? Why have you been spacing out every day since that day?"</p><p></p><p>Wu Che and Hai Dong looked at Gu Helin with puzzlement.</p><p></p><p>Gu Helin snapped out of his daze: "Ah, oh, Senior Brothers."</p><p></p><p>"What's wrong with you?" Hai Dong stared at him intently.</p><p></p><p>Gu Helin swallowed and forced a smile: "Nothing, it's just that I, the junior, am still immersed in the awe-inspiring power of the Immortal Emperor of Longevity and cannot extricate myself..."</p><p></p><p>Hearing this, Wu Che and Hai Dong heaved a sigh of relief. It was understandable.</p><p></p><p>Not only Gu Helin, but they too often found themselves immersed in that kind of awe.</p><p></p><p>That earth-shattering punch still made them gasp in amazement.</p><p></p><p>They realized that attacks could be so violent and straightforward, without the need for complex seals and incantations - just a simple punch.</p><p></p><p>"I see, this is understandable. But Junior Brother Gu, do not let this affect the stability of your cultivation. The Immortal Emperor of Longevity is a unique existence in the ages." Hai Dong sighed.</p><p></p><p>Gu Helin fell silent. He had actually wanted to find Lu Changsheng, but after that day, he dared not.</p><p></p><p>He remembered that in the Lingchen Realm, Tongxin had once asked Lu Changsheng what level he belonged to in the Immortal Realm.</p><p></p><p>Who would have thought... that he was the number one in the Immortal Realm.</p><p></p><p>"Senior Brothers, you may not believe this, but I, the junior, had the honor of drinking with the Immortal Emperor of Longevity."</p><p></p><p>Gu Helin said proudly.</p><p></p><p>Hai Dong and Wu Che were immediately shocked!!!</p><p></p><p>The two hurriedly flew away, their anxious shouts startling countless birds in the forest.</p><p></p><p>"Master, Master, Junior Brother Gu has gone mad!"</p><p></p><p>...</p><p></p><p>Five days passed in a flash.</p><p></p><p>Diwu Xuanzhou, the Heavenly Mechanism Pavilion.</p><p></p><p>Outside the Dao Courtyard, the Immortal Emperors like Old Turtle and Chu Lingxian, as well as the Heavenly Mechanism Pavilion elders, stood.</p><p></p><p>Old Turtle glanced at Chu Lingxian and the others, and said respectfully, "Master, the major Immortal Realms have all been settled, we can set out on the Divine Path now."</p><p></p><p>The crowd waited for a moment, and then a figure in azure robes materialized.</p><p></p><p>Lu Changsheng swept his gaze over the crowd, then looked in a certain direction and said indifferently, "Since everything is in order, then let us depart on the Divine Path."</p><p></p><p>With a wave of his sleeve, a black, gaping portal appeared!</p><p></p><p>At this moment, Gu Yinyang looked at Nangong Jing and smiled, "Nangong, the will of the Immortal Emperor of Longevity, this humble one has already grasped it. When I ascend to the Ancestral Heavenly Realm, this Southern Immortal Realm shall rely on you."</p><p></p><p>Saying that, he pushed a dazzling Immortal Emperor token towards Nangong Jing.</p><p></p><p>Nangong Jing received it with both hands and bowed, "Gu Yinyang Immortal Emperor, please rest assured."</p><p></p><p>The Heavenly Mechanism Pavilion elders were dumbfounded. What was this operation? Their Pavilion Master was going to become the Immortal Emperor of the Southern Immortal Realm? But wasn't he short on lifespan?</p><p></p><p>They looked at Nangong Jing, their eyes filled with doubt and bewilderment.</p><p></p><p>"Let's go," Lu Changsheng said simply, then stepped into the black portal first.</p><p></p><p>Old Turtle and the others followed suit.</p><p></p><p>"We bid farewell to the Immortal Emperors, may your journey be smooth!" </p><p></p><p>Nangong Jing and the Heavenly Mechanism Pavilion elders hurriedly bowed and called out in unison.</p><p></p><p>When they raised their heads, the black portal had already vanished, taking Lu Changsheng and the others with it.</p><p></p><p>"Pavilion Master, why are you going to become an Immortal Emperor? Aren't you short on lifespan?" </p><p></p><p>The Heavenly Mechanism Pavilion elders were the first to look at Nangong Jing, their faces full of confusion.</p><p></p><p>Nangong Jing smiled and his body suddenly shook, unleashing a mighty life force!</p><p></p><p>The crowd was stunned!</p><p></p><p>"You don't need to overthink it. This lifespan of the Pavilion Master was retrieved by the Immortal Emperor of Longevity from the Heavenly Dao."</p><p></p><p>Nangong Jing shook his head and said reverently.</p><p></p><p>"Sss‚Äî"</p><p></p><p>The elders looked at each other in amazement.</p>

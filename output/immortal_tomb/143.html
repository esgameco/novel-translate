        <h1>Chapter 143</h1>
        <div class="content">
            <p>Here is the full English translation of the Chinese excerpt:</p><p></p><p>"That's natural, the five great immortal realms are vast and boundless. We are now in the Southern Immortal Realm, the Langtian Domain of the Fuyao Immortal Island, which is just a small peripheral domain. üéâüí¢‚ùª‚ûàùê¨ƒ§√π‚ìç.¬¢œåŒú‚ôïüéÖ"</p><p></p><p>Haidong smiled amiably.</p><p></p><p>Disregarding the bewildered young disciples, Guchelin laughed and said, "Alright, let's head back to my courtyard first. We can drink and chat, and I'll tell you more later."</p><p></p><p>"Yes, master."</p><p></p><p>Shortly after, in Guchelin's courtyard.</p><p></p><p>Six figures were seated around the stone table.</p><p></p><p>The fragrance of wine permeated the air, making one's heart and spirit feel at ease.</p><p></p><p>"Haha, master, the immortal realm's wine is so delicious," Tongxin said, taking a deep drink and gazing at the liquid in his cup with a dreamy smile.</p><p></p><p>"If you find it delicious, then drink more," Guchelin shook his head with a chuckle.</p><p></p><p>In the past, when they were still in the Mortal Realm, due to his status, Guchelin rarely drank with his disciples like Tongxin. Now that they had ascended to the Immortal Realm, they had all grown up...</p><p></p><p>"Hehe, that's great." Tongxin picked up the wine pitcher and first poured for Guchelin, then for Haidong and Wuchuo, followed by Lin Dong and Chen Datao, and finally for himself. He raised his cup to the group and drank it down contentedly.</p><p></p><p>Haidong and Wuchuo watched with a mix of amusement and exasperation - this Tongxin was quite the lively one.</p><p></p><p>"Master, senior martial brothers, we have just arrived in the immortal realm. Could you please tell us more about it?" Chen Datao asked respectfully, raising his cup.</p><p></p><p>Hearing this, Lin Dong and Tongxin immediately perked up their ears to listen.</p><p></p><p>"Haha, Shixiong Hai can tell you about it," Guchelin said, putting down his cup.</p><p></p><p>Haidong cleared his throat and began, "The immortal realm, ah..."</p><p></p><p>For about half an incense stick's worth of time, Haidong introduced the vastness and unknown of the four cardinal immortal realms, the structure of the five great immortal realms, the severe hierarchical powers of the immortal sects, as well as the cultivation realms in the immortal realm.</p><p></p><p>Tongxin's trio were left gaping, forgetting to even drink their wine, listening as if in a dream.</p><p></p><p>In their minds, the Mortal Realm was already quite large, but they never imagined the four cardinal immortal realms could be so unfathomably vast!</p><p></p><p>Not to mention the unknown regions outside the five great immortal realms, even just the five great immortal realms alone, or even just the Southern Immortal Realm, were extremely expansive.</p><p></p><p>And the terrifying realm divisions, it sounded absolutely horrifying.</p><p></p><p>As newcomers, they had not even solidified the Foundation Immortal realm, let alone the seven realms beyond that.</p><p></p><p>The immortal realm truly had countless great figures.</p><p></p><p>And the five Immortal Emperor realm experts, the rulers of the five great immortal realms, were simply terrifying.</p><p></p><p>Compared to such giants, they probably didn't even have the qualifications to look up to them.</p><p></p><p>A single thought from them could annihilate countless White Moon Sects like theirs.</p><p></p><p>Seeing the dazed trio, Guchelin, Haidong, and Wuchuo exchanged a smile.</p><p></p><p>This was normal - those who had just arrived in the immortal realm from the lower realms would naturally have such a reaction, nothing unusual about it.</p><p></p><p>"All below the Great Dao Realm are inferior..." Tongxin murmured, then suddenly asked, "Master, have you ever seen the Venerable One in your thousand-plus years here?"</p><p></p><p>Lin Dong and Chen Datao's gazes sharpened as they looked at Guchelin.</p><p></p><p>But Guchelin fell silent for a moment before saying, "I've seen him from afar, once."</p><p></p><p>Haidong and Wuchuo also grew puzzled. They didn't understand who this Venerable One was, as Guchelin had mentioned him more than once over the years.</p><p></p><p>"Seen him from afar once?" Tongxin's trio exchanged bewildered looks.</p><p></p><p>"Then why didn't you go pay your respects to him, Master? Do you know where the Venerable One is now? Is he doing well?"</p><p></p><p>Here is the full English translation of the Chinese excerpt:</p><p></p><p>"Huh?" the young disciple asked with hopeful heart.</p><p></p><p>L√º Changsheng had immense gratitude towards these four teacher-disciple companions.</p><p></p><p>Now that he had ascended to the immortal realm, he naturally wanted to repay them.</p><p></p><p>"Uh..." Ancient Crane's eyes flickered.</p><p></p><p>Seeing this, the three young disciples became somewhat suspicious.</p><p></p><p>"Venerable teacher, before in the mortal realm, your disciple momentarily misspoke, naively asking about your strength in the immortal realm..." the young disciple sighed lightly, continuing to self-reproach, </p><p></p><p>"But just now after hearing Senior Brother Sea describe the immortal realm, I realized the immortal realm is so grand, with countless powerful experts. My previous words... might have hurt the Venerable?"</p><p></p><p>Ancient Crane paused, glancing at him silently, as if to say you're overthinking it.</p><p></p><p>"The Venerable once said that once we came to this four-direction immortal realm, we would know his strength in the immortal realm..." Ancient Crane said with pursed lips: "But we only know the Venerable's name, so... what is the Venerable's full name?"</p><p></p><p>The three young disciples bowed and in unison called out: "The Venerable's surname is L√º, given name Changsheng."</p><p></p><p>Crash!</p><p></p><p>Senior Brothers Sea and Wu suddenly stiffened, the wine cups in their hands slipping and falling without them noticing.</p><p></p><p>"Senior Brothers Sea and Wu, what's wrong with you?" </p><p></p><p>the young disciple asked curiously.</p><p></p><p>"N-nothing..."</p><p></p><p>Sea and Wu regained their senses, their hands trembling slightly as they picked up the wine cups again.</p><p></p><p>"Oh." the young disciple responded, his gaze briefly sweeping over their trembling fingertips.</p><p></p><p>In this moment, the three young disciples clearly sensed the atmosphere had become somewhat off.</p><p></p><p>Ancient Crane discreetly glanced at Sea and Wu, understanding their reaction.</p><p></p><p>He then looked at the three young disciples and continued: "Since you now know the Venerable's name, and combine it with what the Venerable previously said, you three can go outside the city and casually ask around to learn all about the Venerable..."</p><p></p><p>Hearing this, the three young disciples had not yet spoken or moved, when Sea and Wu's faces suddenly changed drastically!!</p><p></p><p>They abruptly stood up, staring fixatedly at Ancient Crane, then recalling the "crazy talk" they had previously thought Ancient Crane was spouting, their voices extremely hoarse:</p><p></p><p>"Sworn brother Ancient, you're really not joking?"</p><p></p><p>"Do you know that casually discussing that person behind the scenes, if overheard by someone with ill intent, our White Moon Sect will be in utter calamity!"</p><p></p><p>The three young disciples were dumbfounded, Sea and Wu's behavior was too abnormal, they vaguely understood something, but had not yet fully reacted.</p><p></p><p>Ancient Crane shook his head, straightening his clothes, slowly rising from his seat. Clasping his hands and raising them over his head, he respectfully said,</p><p></p><p>"The Venerable is the supreme ruler of the Central Immortal Realm, bearing the imperial title of Changsheng, being - the number one person in the immortal realm."</p><p></p><p>Sea and Wu's pupils suddenly constricted!</p><p></p><p>Á´•ÂøÉ, Lin Dong, and Chen Dadao were stunned, their faces paling more and more.</p><p></p><p>The imperial title Changsheng, the number one person in the immortal realm...</p><p></p><p>Seeing the expressions of the three young disciples, Ancient Crane sighed: "Now do you understand the Venerable's strength in the immortal realm? To have encountered the Venerable, we four teacher-disciple companions must have accumulated blessings over countless lifetimes."</p><p></p><p>Ancient Crane looked at them with great understanding, after all, he himself had taken a long time to calm the surging, uneasy, and anxious feelings in his heart.</p><p></p><p>The courtyard was silent, everyone still lost in a daze.</p><p></p><p>Their hearts were pounding violently, their spirits trembling intensely,</p><p></p><p>Thump, thump, thump...</p><p></p><p>Just then, light, unhurried footsteps sounded in the courtyard, as if a magical power was pulling them out of their daze.</p><p></p><p>They started, unconsciously turning their heads to look.</p><p></p><p>Only to see a young man in blue robes, hands clasped behind his back, wearing a gentle smile like a spring breeze, quietly approaching the stone table.</p><p></p><p>Ancient Crane and the others were filled with disbelief, their pupils constricting again and again, their bodies trembling.</p><p></p><p>Instinctively, they called out, "Venerable..."</p>

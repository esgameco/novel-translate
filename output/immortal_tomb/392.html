        <h1>Chapter 392</h1>
        <div class="content">
            <p>Here is the full English translation of the Chinese excerpt:</p><p></p><p>The Battlefield of Gods and Demons.</p><p></p><p>Outside the territory of the Heavenly Deity Tribe, in the fog of war, there were nine figures that appeared like ghosts, faintly visible as they rapidly approached the Heavenly Deity Tribe.</p><p></p><p>These figures were the nine great clan leaders, including Bi You and Ao Zhen Tian.</p><p></p><p>Under the deliberate concealment of the great clan leaders like Bi You, the patrolling sentries of the Heavenly Deity Tribe were naturally unaware!</p><p></p><p>So they soon stealthily infiltrated the Heavenly Deity Tribe without a sound.</p><p></p><p>"We need to capture a member of the Heavenly Deity Tribe to question them, otherwise we won't be able to find the location of Shen Ting."</p><p></p><p>"Since Shen Ting has secluded himself to break through to the Divine Realm, the ordinary members of the Heavenly Deity Tribe definitely won't know. We need to capture one of the high-ranking members."</p><p></p><p>"Then let's capture a Deity Priest. It's a pity that the Third Deity Priest of the Heavenly Deity Tribe has already been slain by the Azure Robe Sword Immortal from the Human Tribe. If we capture the Second Deity Priest or even the First Deity Priest... Can the nine of us subdue them instantly?"</p><p></p><p>"With our strength, we should be able to instantly subdue the Second Deity Priest, but the First Deity Priest may not be so easy."</p><p></p><p>"..."</p><p></p><p>The nine great clan leaders were hidden in the spatial dimension, secretly communicating with each other, their words tinged with hesitation.</p><p></p><p>For the nine of them, capturing a Deity Priest would be incredibly simple.</p><p></p><p>The main problem was that they had to subdue the Deity Priest instantly. If they were even a step too slow, and the Deity Priest managed to cry out or send a message, they would be exposed.</p><p></p><p>The Second Deity Priest would be manageable, but the First Deity Priest, as the second-in-command of the Heavenly Deity Tribe, was no ordinary person.</p><p></p><p>Ao Zhen said, "To be on the safe side, let's split up and search for the Second Deity Priest. Once we find him, we'll signal the others, and then we'll all gather to capture him instantly."</p><p></p><p>The clan leaders nodded and disappeared in different directions.</p><p></p><p>...</p><p></p><p>At the same time, by a cliff in the Heavenly Deity Tribe, there were two middle-aged men sitting across from each other, their large white wings folded behind them.</p><p></p><p>Their appearances were surprisingly similar to the deceased Shen Wei!</p><p></p><p>The two were the renowned First Deity Priest and Second Deity Priest of the Heavenly Deity Tribe - Shen Yue and Shen Xing.</p><p></p><p>"Shen Wei has perished in this way... In the past, the three of us would sit atop the cliff, drinking and chatting freely. Now, that scene exists only in our memories."</p><p></p><p>The First Deity Priest, Shen Yue, closed his eyes and sighed.</p><p></p><p>Shen Xing paused for a moment, a hint of malice flashing in his eyes as he said, "If it weren't for the Heavenly Deity Master's imminent breakthrough, I would have long ago gone to the Human Tribe and torn that so-called Azure Robe Sword Immortal to shreds!"</p><p></p><p>Shen Yue looked at the angry Shen Xing and said, "I've heard that the Azure Robe Sword Immortal from the Human Tribe slew a mighty warrior with a single strike, even killing Shen Wei instantly. What could you do against him?"</p><p></p><p>Shen Xing paused, his gaze becoming clearer as he lowered his voice, "All along, the Human Tribe has been concealing their true strength. To have such a powerful expert, yet we've never heard of him before."</p><p></p><p>No wonder the various tribes they had appointed had always failed to deal with the Human Tribe.</p><p></p><p>Shen Yue's eyes flashed, and he thought about the Human Tribe's past miserable state, then said, "Perhaps it's not that they were concealing their strength, but rather that the Azure Robe Sword Immortal is a newcomer to the Battlefield of Gods and Demons?"</p><p></p><p>Shen Xing's mouth twitched slightly, and he waved his hand, "No matter how it is, once the Heavenly Deity Master breaks through to the Divine Realm, the filthy Human Tribe will be destroyed, and all the tribes will have to kneel before our Heavenly Deity Tribe!"</p><p></p><p>"At that time, even the Dao of the Battlefield of Gods and Demons will not dare to defy us."</p><p></p><p>Hearing this, Shen Yue nodded slightly. This was indeed the case.</p><p></p><p>Whenever he thought of the Heavenly Deity Master, his heart was filled with fanaticism. The Divine Realm!</p><p></p><p>In the future, the Heavenly Deity Tribe would be the supreme overlord of the Battlefield of Gods and Demons, and everything, everything, would belong to them.</p><p></p><p>"But speaking of which, the Heavenly Deity Son is still..."</p><p></p><p>Here is the full English translation of the Chinese excerpt:</p><p></p><p>The Human Tribe... I don't know what's going on with them," the Divine Star frowned.</p><p></p><p>"It's fine, let the Divine Son stay there for now. Even if the Human Tribe has a thousand times more courage, they wouldn't dare to kill our Divine Son. The most important thing now is to wait for the breakthrough of the Divine Ancestor."</p><p></p><p>Divine Moon smiled, not at all worried about the safety of Divine Luo.</p><p></p><p>After saying that, Divine Moon's smile gradually faded as if he had thought of something.</p><p></p><p>"Grand Divine Official, what's wrong?" Divine Star asked, puzzled by the change.</p><p></p><p>Divine Moon looked around the vast emptiness and murmured, "Second Divine Official, even though the news of the Divine Ancestor's imminent breakthrough to the Divine Spirit realm has been kept highly secret, I suspect the other nine Clan Leaders have already learned of it."</p><p></p><p>Hearing Divine Moon mention this, Divine Star's eyes narrowed, and he coldly smiled, "Even if they know, so what? Do they dare to infiltrate our Divine Celestial Tribe? Moreover, the Divine Ancestor has already made perfect preparations. Even if they dare to infiltrate, our Divine Celestial Tribe is not a place they can come and go as they please."</p><p></p><p>Divine Moon shook his head slightly, mildly reproaching, "Second Divine Official, when will you change your arrogant and proud personality? Bi You and Ao Zhen Tian are not simple figures who have been able to constrain the Divine Ancestor for so many years!"</p><p></p><p>"Many times, I don't want to criticize you, but when facing Clan Leaders like Bi You and Ao Zhen Tian, you are still so arrogant and contemptuous."</p><p></p><p>Seeing Divine Moon's anger, Divine Star opened his mouth but didn't say anything.</p><p></p><p>Seeing this, Divine Moon didn't say more, but his gaze around had a hint of suspicion.</p><p></p><p>Was it just his imagination?</p><p></p><p>Soon, Divine Moon's eyes narrowed, and he decisively said, "Divine Star, prepare to activate the Divine Imprisonment Formation!"</p><p></p><p>Divine Star was startled, and a hint of panic appeared in his eyes: "Grand Divine Official, what do you mean? Don't tell me Bi You and the others have already infiltrated the Divine Celestial Tribe?"</p><p></p><p>Although he had just been arrogant, he would definitely be panicked when facing those Clan Leaders. Although they were Divine Officials, they were not on the same level as the top ten Clan Leaders.</p><p></p><p>Fortunately, they were now in the main camp of the Divine Celestial Tribe, and they had the means arranged by the Divine Ancestor, so temporarily delaying them should not be a problem.</p><p></p><p>...</p><p></p><p>At the same time, Bi You, Ao Zhen Tian, and other Clan Leaders gathered again.</p><p></p><p>"Soul Devouring Clan Leader, have you found the Second Divine Official?" one of the Clan Leaders asked excitedly.</p><p></p><p>The Soul Devouring Clan Leader nodded and said solemnly, "I found Divine Star, but he is with Divine Moon... And from their conversation, it seems they have already guessed that we will come, and their words don't show much panic."</p><p></p><p>The Clan Leaders' expressions tightened upon hearing this.</p><p></p><p>"Weren't you discovered?" Ao Zhen Tian asked.</p><p></p><p>The Soul Devouring Clan Leader first nodded, then slowly shook his head, "That Divine Moon is indeed the First Divine Official. I feel like he detected me, but it might have been my imagination. The concealment abilities of my Soul Devouring Clan are among the best in the Demon-God Battlefield."</p><p></p><p>Bi You nodded and asked, "Then where are they? Since they are together, let's subdue them both!"</p><p></p><p>"On a cliff," the Soul Devouring Clan Leader said in a deep voice.</p><p></p><p>"Time is of the essence. Let's go, and I'll trouble the Soul Devouring Clan Leader to lead the way!"</p><p></p><p>Bi You let out a low roar and followed the Soul Devouring Clan Leader, along with the other Clan Leaders, swiftly heading towards that cliff.</p>

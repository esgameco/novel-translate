        <h1>Chapter 86</h1>
        <div class="content">
            <p>Here is the full English translation of the Chinese excerpt:</p><p></p><p>"Zong, Zongzhu!" (Patriarch, Sect Master!)</p><p></p><p>The countless disciples and elders of the Tian Heng Sect looked at this scene in disbelief. üç´üç´‚ùªÔºô≈ü—í√πùê±.œÇùì∏Œúüêçüéâ</p><p></p><p>The dignified Sect Master they had just seen was now kneeling down mysteriously... </p><p></p><p>Was it just because of that mysterious blue-robed man's single word "kneel" that the Sect Master obeyed so obediently? Could there be some unknown reason behind this?</p><p></p><p>"Uh."</p><p></p><p>Chu Xiran and Zhang Youdao stared blankly, what was happening before their eyes was completely different from what they had originally imagined!</p><p></p><p>While the Tian Heng Sect Master was inwardly terrified, her face was also burning with shame as she knelt down in front of the entire Tian Heng Sect.</p><p></p><p>She raised her head and looked at the blue-robed man, struggling to speak,</p><p></p><p>"Pr-Predecessor, just who are you...?"</p><p></p><p>Lu Changsheng swept his gaze across the vast mountains and rivers of the Tian Heng Sect, and smiled gently: "Do you know what the first Immortal Edict is?"</p><p></p><p>This smile, however, made the Sect Master's heart skip a beat, the more calm and indifferent the young man appeared, the greater the pressure she felt!</p><p></p><p>Seeing Lu Changsheng staring directly at her, the Tian Heng Sect Master replied hoarsely, "The first Immortal Edict, those who defy the Immortal Edicts shall be condemned to a thousand deaths..."</p><p></p><p>"And what else?" Lu Changsheng asked.</p><p></p><p>For some reason, the Tian Heng Sect Master replied in a dazed manner, "All relatives, families, and even sects related to the defiant ones shall... shall..."</p><p></p><p>"Shall what?" Lu Changsheng asked again.</p><p></p><p>"Shall be punished as accomplices..."</p><p></p><p>The Tian Heng Sect Master seemed to have lost all her strength after saying this.</p><p></p><p>"Good, then according to the Immortal Edicts, you and your sect no longer have the right to exist."</p><p></p><p>Lu Changsheng said calmly.</p><p></p><p>"Predecessor... please don't." </p><p></p><p>The Tian Heng Sect Master's pupils shrank, trembling.</p><p></p><p>At this moment, she felt a sense of despair, because against this mysterious young man, she had no power to resist at all!</p><p></p><p>The countless elders and disciples of the Tian Heng Sect, hearing this terrifying conversation and seeing their Sect Master begging for mercy, all turned pale.</p><p></p><p>Their Tian Heng Sect had suddenly come to the brink of life and death...</p><p></p><p>Seeing that Lu Changsheng was unmoved, the Tian Heng Sect Master's eyes were conflicted, but she unhesitatingly gave the order, shouting loudly in the sky.</p><p></p><p>"All elders, hear my command, activate the Protective Sect Formation!!"</p><p></p><p>Immediately, the Tian Heng Sect was in an uproar!</p><p></p><p>Many figures flashed back and forth, and soon, with a 'humming' sound, a golden light barrier floated up, enclosing the entire Tian Heng Sect like a giant bowl.</p><p></p><p>Seeing the Protective Sect Formation activated, the countless disciples and elders of the Tian Heng Sect finally breathed a sigh of relief, but as they looked up at the formation above their Sect Master, their eyes were filled with worry.</p><p></p><p>What will happen to the Sect Master...?</p><p></p><p>Lu Changsheng saw this and his expression remained indifferent, he only slightly adjusted his loose sleeves.</p><p></p><p>The Tian Heng Sect Master suddenly felt a murderous aura enveloping her, her heart became more and more anxious and restless.</p><p></p><p>She was now at the Gold Immortal Eighth Realm, with tens of thousands of years of lifespan left, she had not yet broken through to the Great Dao of Gold Immortal, she could not die like this!</p><p></p><p>"Ancestor, save me!!"</p><p></p><p>The Tian Heng Sect Master cried out in despair.</p><p></p><p>The next moment, deep within the Tian Heng Sect, there was a tremor, a stream of divine light broke through the mountain, and in the blink of an eye, appeared before Lu Changsheng.</p><p></p><p>It was an old man with a fading aura, surrounded by the air of death, obviously his lifespan was not much left.</p><p></p><p>"Ancestor... has actually broken the seal?" </p><p></p><p>The elders below were overjoyed, as high-ranking members, they naturally knew that there was still an Ancestor in the sect, but the disciples had never seen this so-called Ancestor before.</p><p></p><p>But seeing the reactions of the Sect Master and the elders, they knew this must be a very ancient existence in the sect.</p><p></p><p>In the sky.</p><p></p><p>"Ancestor, I'm sorry." </p><p></p><p>The Tian Heng Sect Master bowed her head in shame.</p><p></p><p>The fading old man looked at her absentmindedly, waving his hand slightly and sighing, "It's alright, it's not your fault, this old man sealed himself for five hundred thousand years with a heretical technique,</p><p></p><p>Here is the full English translation of the Chinese excerpt:</p><p></p><p>"It's just a half-step ascension to the Great Dao, and I still haven't fully fathomed the Great Dao... Even if you didn't summon me out today, I would have reached the end of my life anyway, hehe... Thinking about it now, it all seems to have happened yesterday."</p><p></p><p>The Sovereign of the Eternal Heavens fell silent.</p><p></p><p>Self-cultivated for 500,000 years! Half-step Great Dao!</p><p></p><p>Chu Xiruo and Zhang Youdao were both terrified upon hearing this!</p><p></p><p>Chu Xiruo deeply understood the implications - according to the lifespan of Earthly Immortals being 30,000 years, Celestial Immortals 100,000 years, and Golden Immortals 600,000 years, this elder must have reached the end of his lifespan and used a heavenly technique to prolong his existence until now.</p><p></p><p>In other words, this elder was a cultivator from a hundred thousand years ago!</p><p></p><p>Presumably, this half-step Great Dao elder must be extremely formidable now, as the saying goes in the Immortal Realm - all below the Great Dao are considered inferior.</p><p></p><p>As for Zhang Youdao, what terrified him was the fact that in the Lower Realm, the lifespan of Tribulation Crossing cultivators was only around 5,000 years, while the Immortal Realm's lifespan units were in the tens of thousands - this was utterly shocking to him.</p><p></p><p>The elder sighed again, then looked at Lu Changsheng.</p><p></p><p>"Fellow Daoist, why have you summoned me, the Sovereign of the Eternal Heavens?"</p><p></p><p>Seeing the elder suddenly fall silent, all the people present were puzzled and focused their attention.</p><p></p><p>The elder, who had been surrounded by a gloomy aura, was now trembling violently, his breathing becoming increasingly erratic. His face, like coarse cloth, had his pupils constricted to pinpoints, filled with disbelief, trepidation, and reverence. His mouth slightly opened, but it was as if his throat was being strangled, unable to produce a single sound...</p><p></p><p>The Sovereign of the Eternal Heavens noticed the elder's abnormal state and asked in confusion, "Great... Great Ancestor, what's wrong with you?"</p><p></p><p>At this moment, the one she called the Great Ancestor knelt down, trembling.</p><p></p><p>The Sovereign of the Eternal Heavens' face flashed with panic. This scene was strikingly similar to her own previous kneeling - could it be that even the mighty Great Ancestor was no match for the young man before them?</p><p></p><p>The world fell silent, and everyone stared dumbfoundedly at the kneeling elder in the sky, their minds in a daze, unsure of what was happening.</p><p></p><p>But the title the elder uttered next fell like thunderous lightning from the nine heavens!</p><p></p><p>"My... My humble self pays respects to... the Immortal Emperor Changsheng."</p><p></p><p>The people in the world were struck as if by electricity, their heartbeats racing, a sense of suffocation overwhelming them.</p><p></p><p>"Changsheng..."</p><p></p><p>Chu Xiruo stared at the young man in blue, her knuckles turning white, as if she had lost her soul.</p><p></p><p>Zhang Youdao swallowed hard. He didn't know why everyone was reacting this way, but he knew that this mysterious young senior must be of great importance.</p><p></p><p>He could never have imagined that the "great importance" he spoke of... was the pinnacle of the Four Directions Immortal Realm!</p><p></p><p>In the sky, the elder bowed his head, trembling, his eyes filled with fear, but more so with excitement and exhilaration.</p><p></p><p>To have the honor of seeing the legendary Immortal Emperor Changsheng, he, whose lifespan had reached its end, could die without regrets!</p><p></p><p>Lu Changsheng stood with his hands behind his back, casting an indifferent glance at the elder, then turned to look at the vast Eternal Heavens Sect, his majestic immortal voice resounding through the heavens and earth.</p><p></p><p>"I, the Immortal Emperor Changsheng, decree that the Sovereign of the Eternal Heavens has violated the Immortal Dao, and the Eternal Heavens Sect shall be eradicated."</p><p></p><p>The next moment, Lu Changsheng slightly raised his palm and pressed down indifferently.</p><p></p><p>"Boom!!!"</p><p></p><p>The protective sect formation instantly shattered into pieces, and a earth-shattering tremor suddenly appeared, like the end of the world.</p><p></p><p>The countless buildings of the Eternal Heavens Sect instantly collapsed, taking the dumbfounded disciples and elders with them, reducing them all to dust.</p><p></p><p>The once grand miles of mountains and rivers were now a vacuum field, a mass grave.</p><p></p><p>Chu Xiruo and Zhang Youdao stood trembling in the ruins, their faces deathly pale and bloodless.</p><p></p><p>Somehow, they remained unharmed in this terrifying destruction.</p><p></p><p>The two looked around the seemingly endless ruins of the Eternal Heavens Sect in bewilderment.</p><p></p><p>A chilling wind blew, causing their souls to tremble.</p>

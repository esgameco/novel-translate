        <div class="content">
            <p>Here is the full English translation of the Chinese excerpt:</p><p></p><p>In the Chengzhu Manor, in a luxurious room.</p><p></p><p>The unconscious Yun Aoye slowly regained consciousness.</p><p></p><p>Yun Aoye's eyes first gradually focused, then he stared blankly at the ceiling for a moment, before suddenly sitting up in alarm: "Summon someone!"</p><p></p><p>Boom!</p><p></p><p>The four subordinates outside quickly pushed open the door and hurried to Yun Aoye's side, bowing respectfully: "Your Highness!"</p><p></p><p>Yun Aoye glanced sideways at the four subordinates, frowning as he demanded: "Where am I? What happened?"</p><p></p><p>Yun Aoye's memory cut off right when he was about to scold that old servant, and he couldn't recall anything after that.</p><p></p><p>Yun Aoye felt very puzzled, wondering how he could have suddenly lost consciousness like that.</p><p></p><p>The four subordinates trembled slightly, and one of them respectfully replied:</p><p></p><p>"Your Highness, you are now in the Chengzhu Manor. As for why you are here, it was at the behest of the Qin Saint..."</p><p></p><p>As he spoke, the subordinate lowered his head even further.</p><p></p><p>He had already spoken very tactfully, not daring to directly say that it was the Qin Saint who had knocked Yun Aoye unconscious.</p><p></p><p>Yun Aoye was taken aback, but not entirely surprised, as he had vaguely guessed that it was Uncle Ye who had knocked him out.</p><p></p><p>After all, in this Tianxiang City, aside from Uncle Ye, who else would dare and have the ability to knock him unconscious?</p><p></p><p>The only question was, why did Uncle Ye want to knock him out?</p><p></p><p>Could it really be just because of the other party's musical skills?</p><p></p><p>Yun Aoye admitted that he might not be able to understand Uncle Ye's obsession with musical skills.</p><p></p><p>After a moment of silence, Yun Aoye pursed his lips and asked, "Where is Uncle Ye?"</p><p></p><p>Thump thump thump...</p><p></p><p>At this moment, Ye Xunwang entered the room.</p><p></p><p>"The Qin Saint!" </p><p></p><p>The four subordinates immediately bowed in reverence.</p><p></p><p>Although they were Yun Aoye's trusted and capable subordinates, they understood Ye Xunwang's weighty status in the ancient Kingdom of Yunlan, and naturally did not dare to show the slightest negligence.</p><p></p><p>Even if Yun Aoye and Ye Xunwang issued orders simultaneously, they would unhesitatingly obey Ye Xunwang's!</p><p></p><p>The four subordinates, having some foresight, bowed and then retreated, closing the door behind them.</p><p></p><p>After a brief silence in the room, a bitter smile appeared on Yun Aoye's face: "Uncle Ye, why..."</p><p></p><p>Of course, Yun Aoye could never get angry at Ye Xunwang, as aside from fearing him, he also held him in the utmost respect.</p><p></p><p>Ye Xunwang came over and sat down, taking out the ancient zither, gently caressing its broken and disheveled strings.</p><p></p><p>"Aoye, come with me to Youting Lake again tomorrow."</p><p></p><p>Yun Aoye paused, then excitedly said:</p><p></p><p>"Uncle Ye, are you going to discipline that arrogant master and servant? Good! Let's set out immediately!"</p><p></p><p>As he spoke, Yun Aoye quickly got up from the bed, unable to wait.</p><p></p><p>Ye Xunwang's brow furrowed, "Insolent!"</p><p></p><p>Huh?</p><p></p><p>Yun Aoye was taken aback, and although he was puzzled in his heart, he still lowered his head, not daring to look directly at Ye Xunwang, as he rarely saw Uncle Ye angry.</p><p></p><p>Ye Xunwang looked steadily at Yun Aoye. "Aoye, never dare to say such things again. If the royal family of the capital is destroyed, you will be a sinner for all eternity, and then it will be too late for regret."</p><p></p><p>Huh? This is so serious?</p><p></p><p>Yun Aoye was stunned again!</p><p></p><p>In his entire life, Yun Aoye had never felt as lost as he did today.</p><p></p><p>"Uncle Ye... Aoye does not understand."</p><p></p><p>Yun Aoye said bitterly.</p><p></p><p>Ye Xunwang caressed the ancient zither in front of him, closing his eyes as he said:</p><p></p><p>"That gentleman's servant could suppress me, your Uncle Ye, to death with a single palm strike..."</p><p></p><p>As he said this, Ye Xunwang, disregarding Yun Aoye's frantically widening eyes, his voice even slightly trembling, continued:</p><p></p><p>"Then do you think, the master behind him, is what kind of existence?"</p><p></p><p>Yun Aoye stood there dumbfounded, his pupils trembling violently!!</p><p></p><p>Yun Aoye understood Ye Xunwang, he was not the kind of person to make such a huge joke.</p><p></p><p>From Ye Xunwang's words, he could hear that he had already been disciplined by that servant...</p><p></p><p>Yun Aoye suddenly recalled his previous words and attitude at Youting Lake, </p><p></p><p>and his body finally began to tremble uncontrollably!!</p><p></p><p>His own death would not matter, after all, Yun Aoye had lived a life of glory and wealth.</p><p></p><p>But if he were to implicate the entire capital and the royal family, he would be forever recorded in history, and reviled for all eternity in the ancient Kingdom of Yunlan!</p><p></p><p>Thinking of this, Yun Aoye staggered, barely managing to support himself on the table, his complexion deathly pale, trembling as he said:</p><p></p><p>"Uncle Ye, what should I do?"</p><p></p><p>Ye Xunwang looked at the terrified Yun Aoye and solemnly said, "Apologize."</p><p></p><p>Yun Aoye, no longer caring about the dignity of the royal family, hurriedly nodded: "Okay, okay, I'll apologize, I'll apologize!!"</p><p></p><p>Ye Xunwang felt somewhat relieved, as although Aoye was usually carefree, he could still discern what was important. He then said, "Don't rush, that gentleman has already been disturbed by us today, it's not appropriate to go again. Tomorrow, tomorrow we'll go."</p><p></p><p>"Okay... okay, I'll listen to Uncle Ye." Yun Aoye said hastily.</p><p></p><p>"Mm." Ye Xunwang nodded, then lowered his head to look at the broken strings on the ancient zither, his eyes filled with longing.</p><p></p><p>Here is the full English translation of the Chinese excerpt:</p><p></p><p>It emerged.</p><p></p><p>As for Cloud Ao Xie, he just stood there, still at a loss.</p><p></p><p>...</p><p></p><p>The next day.</p><p></p><p>Tian Xiang City was still the same Tian Xiang City, but the atmosphere of the entire city was noticeably different, lacking the bustling and lively energy of the past, and appearing more solemn.</p><p></p><p>After all, everyone had witnessed the events that took place at Youting Lake the day before.</p><p></p><p>Although the Qin Immortal had completely defeated the Qin Saint in terms of qin playing skills.</p><p></p><p>However, the series of events that had occurred showed that he had no regard for the Qin Saint and the royal family, which was no different from openly slapping the royal family's face.</p><p></p><p>Especially the words spoken by the Qin Immortal's servant at the time, to be frank, were truly arrogant.</p><p></p><p>Even the ordinary citizens of the city were shaken to their core, let alone the Ninth Prince, a member of the royal family.</p><p></p><p>As a result, countless gazes in Tian Xiang City were focused on Youting Lake, closely monitoring the situation there.</p><p></p><p>The citizens unanimously believed that the Ninth Prince would not let this go easily.</p><p></p><p>...</p><p></p><p>The sun was high in the sky, at the height of noon, the sunlight scorching.</p><p></p><p>Cloud Ao Xie and Ye Xun Wang, among others, finally left the Mansion of the City Lord, escorted by Guo Xiong and others, and headed towards Youting Lake once again.</p><p></p><p>Immediately, Tian Xiang City was in an uproar, and the citizens were filled with worry.</p><p></p><p>It was about to begin.</p><p></p><p>The citizens dared not imagine the scene of the Qin Immortal being eliminated, and just the thought of it made them feel deeply saddened.</p><p></p><p>He was a true master of the qin, how could he just fall like this?</p><p></p><p>Thinking that they would never again hear the Qin Immortal's playing, the eyes of the citizens reddened, and many young ladies even broke down in tears.</p><p></p><p>Unfortunately, they dared not express themselves, as they were too insignificant in the face of the mighty royal family.</p><p></p><p>Zhu Qingqing and Luo Linyan also came out of the mansion and headed to Youting Lake, their expressions anxious.</p><p></p><p>Zhu Qingqing's eyes held a mysterious determination.</p><p></p><p>At the same time, Cloud Ao Xie and the others quickly arrived at Youting Lake, heading towards the unassuming courtyard.</p><p></p><p>Today, Youting Lake was once again packed, with countless gazes directed towards them.</p><p></p><p>These gazes made Cloud Ao Xie's body stiffen.</p><p></p><p>He was not afraid of being punished, but he feared the many onlookers...</p><p></p><p>At the same time, Guo Xiong and the mansion manager exchanged a subtle glance, their hearts filled with joy.</p><p></p><p>Good, good, everything was progressing as expected. After today, that Qin Immortal would be no more.</p><p></p><p>No matter how extraordinary his qin skills were, he was ultimately just a musician. In a world that revered martial prowess, he would be unable to stir up any waves.</p><p></p><p>Soon, Cloud Ao Xie and the others finally arrived at the courtyard and stood still.</p><p></p><p>Guo Xiong's eyes flickered, about to ask if they should break down the courtyard gate,</p><p></p><p>But at that moment, Zhu Qingqing's figure suddenly flashed in front of the courtyard!</p><p></p><p>The entire Youting Lake was stunned for a moment, and then erupted in an uproar!!</p><p></p><p>"Miss!" The anxious Little Chen on the shore watched the Zhu Qingqing who had appeared in front of the courtyard, momentarily distracted and unaware that his mistress had...</p><p></p><p>Behind Cloud Ao Xie, Zhu Gu was stunned, his face suddenly turning pale, and then he was horrified, shouting:</p><p></p><p>"Qingqing, what are you trying to do!!"</p><p></p><p>Cloud Ao Xie and Ye Xun Wang also stared at the woman in front of them, not understanding her intentions.</p><p></p><p>Zhu Qingqing slowly knelt down, her voice trembling as she pleaded in front of the powerful figure: "Your Highness the Ninth Prince, Qingqing knows that she is insignificant, but can you, can you spare the Qin Immortal's life? Qingqing is willing to do anything for you."</p><p></p><p>Zhu Gu was dumbfounded where he stood. He never imagined that his own daughter would be so infatuated with that Qin Immortal??? </p><p>Now everything was exposed before the Ninth Prince, it was all over, everything was over...</p><p></p><p>Guo Xiong, the mansion manager, and Luo Qian were delighted at the sight.</p><p></p><p>Unexpectedly, there was this unexpected harvest?</p><p></p><p>The Zhu Family was doomed!</p><p></p><p>"Your Highness the Ninth Prince, the Qin Saint, Qingqing, she was just momentarily confused, she, she..."</p><p></p><p>Zhu Gu trembled as he tried to explain, but in this situation, he did not know how to...</p><p></p><p>However, Cloud Ao Xie had no time to deal with these trivial matters at the moment, he was terrified himself!!</p><p></p><p>Surely these people had all misunderstood!</p><p></p><p>Cloud Ao Xie then looked at Ye Xun Wang beside him, and said with difficulty: "Uncle Ye..."</p><p></p><p>Ye Xun Wang nodded, and a sharp thorn appeared in his hand, which he handed to Cloud Ao Xie.</p><p></p><p>Cloud Ao Xie took a deep breath, his hands trembling as he accepted the thorn and raised it high above his head, suddenly kneeling down on both knees, trembling as he shouted:</p><p></p><p>"I, Cloud Ao Xie, the Ninth Prince of the Cloud Ao Ancient Kingdom, have come to apologize. I beg for Your Highness's punishment!!"</p><p></p><p>Ye Xun Wang sighed inwardly, and also slowly knelt down...</p><p></p><p>This sudden turn of events plunged Youting Lake into absolute silence, with everyone frozen in their tracks, dumbfounded, as if they had been turned to stone.</p>

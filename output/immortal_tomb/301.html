        <h1>Chapter 301</h1>
        <div class="content">
            <p>Here is the full English translation of the Chinese excerpt:</p><p></p><p>"Greetings, City Lord!" </p><p></p><p>Duan Jiuxiong appeared, and all the young celestial masters in the hall rose to salute him. ‚ôî‚úåÔºñÔºô‡∏£ƒßÔΩï–ñ.‚í∏„Ññùî™üí¢üçÆ</p><p></p><p>However, Lu Changsheng was still sitting and drinking tea, as he was a celestial master from the Immortal Emperor realm, his seat was slightly off to the side, and he was shielded by Fu Shiyu and the others, so no one noticed him.</p><p></p><p>Only Blood Demon Moon's peripheral vision was constantly on Lu Changsheng.</p><p></p><p>"Haha, City Lord Duan, it's been a while, your heroic spirit is still as strong as ever."</p><p></p><p>At this time, the Bloodfiend Pavilion Master sitting on the plaza spoke and laughed.</p><p></p><p>Duan Jiuxiong naturally knew that the top powers of the Ancient Wasteland had all arrived, and he sighed with a smile: "Bloodfiend Pavilion Master, you flatter me. No matter how I am, I am still just a small city lord, incomparable to you great power lords."</p><p></p><p>This was not false modesty on his part, but the truth.</p><p></p><p>The Bloodfiend Pavilion, the Nangong Clan, and the Assassin Tower were all top powers from other regions of the Ancient Wasteland, not from his royal city.</p><p></p><p>The celestial masters from the Divine Yang Realm in his royal city did occupy a lot, but among the top five, there was only one, the L√≠ Clan's L√≠ Qing.</p><p></p><p>The other top five celestial masters were all from the major top powers of the Ancient Wasteland.</p><p></p><p>"City Lord Duan is being too humble." The Nangong Clan Elder's face showed a smile.</p><p></p><p>The others remained silent, as Duan Jiuxiong's personal strength was on the same level as theirs, and he was the organizer of the current Celestial Master Convention arranged by the Ancient Wasteland Divine Sword Clan, so the proper courtesy had to be given.</p><p></p><p>Behind Miao Hantian, Liu Tu, Fu Liangcai, and Liu Qing were very restrained, for they had never seen so many big shots before.</p><p></p><p>"Haha, everyone, let's not beat around the bush."</p><p></p><p>Duan Jiuxiong cupped his hands towards the Bloodfiend Pavilion Master and the others, then turned and scanned the group of celestial masters, smiling: "The tea talk shall begin, everyone... make yourselves at home."</p><p></p><p>With that, he turned and walked towards the audience seats, exchanging a few cold words with the Bloodfiend Pavilion Master and the others before sitting down calmly.</p><p></p><p>.........</p><p></p><p>During the tea talk,</p><p></p><p>The celestial masters slowly sat down in their seats, some drinking tea, some eating fruit, in the soft zither music, no one spoke first.</p><p></p><p>On the surface, it seemed harmonious.</p><p></p><p>But in reality, everyone knew that most of the celestial masters here were just going through the motions.</p><p></p><p>This so-called tea talk was actually the battlefield for the nineteen celestial masters of the Divine Yang Realm!</p><p></p><p>The nineteen celestial masters would have a battle today, deciding the top ten, deciding the first, second, third, and fourth places!</p><p></p><p>Although the top ten can all become Sword Attendants, the ranking will make a difference, and the higher the ranking, the better.</p><p></p><p>Lu Changsheng lowered his head, quietly peeling an orange, suddenly raised his head and looked at Blood Demon Moon with a faint gaze.</p><p></p><p>Blood Demon Moon's heart skipped a beat, and she unnaturally averted her gaze.</p><p></p><p>"Hehe, everyone, I, Evilslayer, have always been straightforward and not fond of beating around the bush, so I'll just say it directly today, the first place of this Celestial Master Convention, I, the Holy Son, want it."</p><p></p><p>Suddenly, a voice spoke, and the celestial masters were startled, all turning their gaze towards the calm tea-drinking Evilslayer.</p><p></p><p>How domineering!</p><p></p><p>.........</p><p></p><p>"Hehe, Evilslayer truly lives up to being the Holy Son of the Bloodfiend Pavilion, his domineering character is just like the Bloodfiend Pavilion Master's back then."</p><p></p><p>On the other side, Duan Jiuxiong smiled with a glint in his eyes.</p><p></p><p>The Nangong Clan Elder and the others also smiled, but a trace of displeasure could be seen in their eyes, as they did not think their own celestial masters were inferior to Evilslayer.</p><p></p><p>The Bloodfiend Pavilion Master smiled: "Evilslayer's character has always been like this, everyone, don't be uncomfortable in your hearts, he doesn't mean anything else."</p><p></p><p>"Hehe hehe." The others responded with a smile.</p><p></p><p>Then they focused their attention on the tea talk, observing the development of the situation.</p><p></p><p>The Celestial Master Convention was not only important for the celestial masters, but also extremely important for these power lords.</p><p></p><p>If their own celestial master succeeded...</p><p></p><p>Here is the full English translation of the Chinese excerpt:</p><p></p><p>As a sword servant of the ancient Chaos God Sword Clan, his power and influence would rise along with theirs.</p><p></p><p>The new 69 book bar 99 SHU X.COM</p><p></p><p>...</p><p></p><p>The zither music had disappeared from the tea gathering at some point.</p><p></p><p>The nineteen supreme celestial prodigies each had their own demeanor.</p><p></p><p>"Esha, you don't think you can just say a few words and claim the first place, do you? There's no such easy path in this world. Others may be wary of your identity as the Holy Son of the Blood Demon Sect, but I'm not afraid."</p><p></p><p>"That's right, if you want the first place, you'll have to prove it with your strength. Just being ranked as a top prodigy doesn't mean you're truly the best, does it?"</p><p></p><p>The ones speaking were Nangong Wenxin and Lai Qing.</p><p></p><p>As for Wuying and Xueye...</p><p></p><p>The crowd looked at the two with puzzlement, it seemed they weren't going to compete for the moment.</p><p></p><p>Esha coldly smiled, "Unsatisfied? Then let's battle."</p><p></p><p>He was determined to claim the first place in the Celestial Prodigy Assembly.</p><p></p><p>Nangong Wenxin's eyes flickered, to be honest, he still feared Esha. The overall strength of the Blood Demon Sect was slightly higher than his Nangong Clan.</p><p></p><p>The Blood Demon Sect could even be considered the number one power under the Ancient Chaos God Sword Clan!</p><p></p><p>And since Esha could rank as the top prodigy, he must possess formidable abilities as well.</p><p></p><p>"If Esha becomes the champion of this Celestial Prodigy Assembly, I have no objections."</p><p></p><p>Just then, the silent Wuying spoke up.</p><p></p><p>Huh...!</p><p></p><p>The entire audience was shocked!</p><p></p><p>What's going on, why would the Young Master of the Assassin Tower say such words!</p><p></p><p>If the scene before them was witnessed by the Tower Master, what would happen?</p><p></p><p>...</p><p></p><p>"Oh?" </p><p></p><p>Duan Jiuxiong was puzzled and turned his head to look at the figure shrouded in a black robe beside him. This was the renowned Assassin Tower Master.</p><p></p><p>Many of the people present also glanced at the black-robed figure, their eyes flickering.</p><p></p><p>"Hehe, everyone need not be surprised, this matter has already been discussed privately between our Sect Master and the Assassin Tower Master." The Blood Demon Sect Master said calmly with a smile.</p><p></p><p>The hoarse voice of the Assassin Tower Master also sounded, "That's right."</p><p></p><p>Hearing this, the crowd fell silent, no one knew what kind of deal these two had made in private.</p><p></p><p>...</p><p></p><p>"Esha Holy Son's strength is at the pinnacle among us, the first place rightfully belongs to him, I agree."</p><p></p><p>"I agree."</p><p></p><p>"I agree as well."</p><p></p><p>"..."</p><p></p><p>One after another, voices of agreement rang out in the tea gathering, leaving the audience utterly astounded.</p><p></p><p>Because these agreeing voices all belonged to the celestial prodigies!</p><p></p><p>How could this be? They should be proud as celestial prodigies.</p><p></p><p>At the same time, the spectator stands were also in an uproar.</p><p></p><p>However, the faction leaders of these celestial prodigies remained calm, as if they had anticipated all of this.</p><p></p><p>"Haha, thank you all for giving our Sect this face..." </p><p></p><p>The Blood Demon Sect Master stood up and bowed with a smile, as if everything was under his control.</p><p></p><p>Duan Jiuxiong's expression had turned somewhat unsightly now.</p><p></p><p>Having just one Wuying was already troublesome, but now so many celestial prodigies were supporting Esha!</p><p></p><p>It seemed the Blood Demon Sect had already secretly arranged everything...</p><p></p><p>This was no different from manipulating the competition.</p><p></p><p>But as the organizer, he couldn't really say anything. That would be going against the Blood Demon Sect.</p><p></p><p>Although he was appointed by the Ancient Chaos God Sword Clan to organize the Celestial Prodigy Assembly, he was just the organizer after all.</p><p></p><p>He understood that the Clan only wanted the top ten prodigies to be recruited into their ranks, the exact rankings didn't matter much to them.</p><p></p><p>If he were to stand up and question this, it would only bring him trouble.</p>

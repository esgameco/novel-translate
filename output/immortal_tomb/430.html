        <h1>Chapter 430</h1>
        <div class="content">
            <p>Here is the full English translation of the Chinese excerpt:</p><p></p><p>The imperial guards opened their eyes in a daze, seeming a bit impatient. Who had disturbed their enjoyment of the music?</p><p></p><p>But when they saw Emperor Yunze, they immediately panicked and hurriedly knelt down. "Your Majesty! Your Majesty!"</p><p></p><p>"Hmph." Emperor Yunze snorted coldly and said, "The music is indeed beautiful, but the Observation Pavilion is an important place, and now a distinguished guest is within. If someone were to sneak in and disturb the guest, what crime would you be guilty of?"</p><p></p><p>"Your Majesty, please calm down!" The guards were terrified and kowtowed, not daring to speak.</p><p></p><p>"There shouldn't be anyone inside, right?" Emperor Yunze asked, still uneasy.</p><p></p><p>"No, no, Your Majesty, rest assured!" The guard captain hurriedly replied.</p><p></p><p>Even if they had just been immersed in the music and neglected their duties, they knew very well that no one would dare to enter the Observation Pavilion.</p><p></p><p>Emperor Yunze let out a slight sigh of relief, and then, without further ado, he listened to the music, looking up at the Observation Terrace and sighed, "My dear brother, this young man in blue is indeed quite remarkable."</p><p></p><p>"The heartbreaking melody, no wonder these guards were captivated. As they say, this tune should only be heard in the heavens, how could it be heard on earth..."</p><p></p><p>Ye Xunwang bitterly smiled, his eyes filled with even more longing. He wished that one day he too could possess such extraordinary skills.</p><p></p><p>Beside them, the Empress, concubines, and imperial princes and princesses listened to the music, hesitating to speak.</p><p></p><p>Everyone knew that the distinguished guest on the Observation Terrace must be the same person the Emperor had previously led the officials to welcome at the East Gate.</p><p></p><p>...</p><p></p><p>Ke Nan soon arrived at the Observation Terrace. Hearing the sound, she quickly spotted a figure in blue robes sitting cross-legged.</p><p></p><p>Seeing that figure in blue, Ke Nan inexplicably felt a sense of fear and shrinking back. She carefully hid behind the door, only daring to peek out her head to observe from afar.</p><p></p><p>Compared to Emperor Yunze and the others, being so close to the music, Ke Nan soon became lost in the melody.</p><p></p><p>After a moment, Lucheng's hands paused, gently steadying the vibrating strings.</p><p></p><p>The continuous music gradually faded away.</p><p></p><p>...</p><p></p><p>Outside the Observation Pavilion.</p><p></p><p>Emperor Yunze and the others snapped out of their reverie, unable to resist the urge to applaud, but they stopped, afraid of disturbing the person above.</p><p></p><p>Emperor Yunze stood for a while, hesitating, and finally sighed, "Forget it."</p><p></p><p>He had wanted to go up and meet the person, but thinking about the timing, he decided it was better to do it another day.</p><p></p><p>With that in mind, Emperor Yunze looked at the crowd and frowned, "The distinguished guest has finished playing, and you all are still standing here doing what? Quickly leave! A bunch of curious onlookers, learn from Ke Nan!"</p><p></p><p>The concubines, princes, and princesses hurriedly paid their respects and left, their gazes reluctant.</p><p></p><p>Soon, only Emperor Yunze, Ye Xunwang, and the Empress were left standing, while the guards remained respectfully kneeling.</p><p></p><p>"Your Majesty, this distinguished guest..." Empress Zhang Yan asked curiously.</p><p></p><p>Zhang Yan was the mother of Yun Caotong and the current Empress.</p><p></p><p>Emperor Yunze frowned and waved his hand, "Empress, be careful with your words. It's best not to discuss the distinguished guest behind his back."</p><p></p><p>Zhang Yan paused, her face slightly paling, and she dared not say more.</p><p></p><p>Emperor Yunze then looked at Ye Xunwang, seeing his strange expression, and couldn't help but smile, "Brother, could it be that you wish to become the distinguished guest's disciple?"</p><p></p><p>Hearing this, Ye Xunwang shook his head and bitterly smiled, "Your Majesty understands me well. But alas, Your Majesty does not know, the distinguished guest has already rejected me before."</p><p></p><p>Huh?</p><p></p><p>Emperor Yunze never expected that Ye Xunwang had already approached the distinguished guest...</p><p></p><p>Emperor Yunze patted Ye Xunwang's shoulder, "Brother, you are too impatient. Good things take time."</p><p></p><p>Having said that, Emperor Yunze took Empress Zhang Yan's hand and left.</p><p></p><p>"Respectfully seeing off Your Majesty and the Empress!" The guards hurriedly exclaimed.</p><p></p><p>But they still dared not get up.</p><p></p><p>Here is the full English translation of the Chinese excerpt:</p><p></p><p>...because Ye Xunwang was still standing there foolishly...</p><p></p><p>The imperial guards were inwardly lamenting, "Your Highness the Qin Saint, please hurry up and leave, our knees are already aching from kneeling!"</p><p></p><p>"Good things take time..."</p><p></p><p>Ye Xunwang murmured a sentence, finally turning and leaving.</p><p></p><p>"Respectfully seeing off Your Highness the Qin Saint!" The imperial guards exclaimed joyfully.</p><p></p><p>Who knew that Ye Xunwang's footsteps suddenly paused, then he turned around and glared coldly at the imperial guards, saying icily, "From now on, whoever dares to call me the Qin Saint again will have their bones stripped and their skin peeled off! Hmph!"</p><p></p><p>With a cold snort, Ye Xunwang seemed to feel ashamed, and left without looking back.</p><p></p><p>The imperial guards trembled as they got up from the ground, exchanging bitter smiles, having much to lament about...</p><p></p><p>...</p><p></p><p>On the other side, Yunze Cang and Zhang Yan were strolling among the buildings, and the eunuchs and palace maids they passed all paid their respects.</p><p></p><p>Yunze Cang was silent for a long time, then suddenly said:</p><p></p><p>"Perhaps Princess Ning will soon marry the Prince of Fenglu, what does the Queen think about this?"</p><p></p><p>Zhang Yan's body stiffened, as the Queen, although she usually didn't pay attention to these matters, she naturally knew something about the conflicts between the ancient Kingdom of Yunlan and the ancient Kingdom of Fenglu. She then replied in a low voice:</p><p></p><p>"Princess Ning is the king's most beloved princess, Your Majesty, I know the king must be reluctant in his heart."</p><p></p><p>Yunze Cang smiled, "The love I have for Ning and Aoye is known to all in the capital, there's nothing to say about that. What I'm asking is your opinion on this matter?"</p><p></p><p>Zhang Yan was now very nervous, afraid of saying the wrong thing, so she compromised and said:</p><p></p><p>"This is a matter related to court politics, I... have no opinion."</p><p></p><p>Yunze Cang walked with his hands behind his back, looking straight ahead, "Then, does the Queen think that if the ancient Kingdom of Yunlan and the ancient Kingdom of Fenglu go to war, who will win?"</p><p></p><p>Zhang Yan's heart jumped, and she couldn't help but ask anxiously, "Didn't Your Majesty say you would marry Princess Ning to the Prince of Fenglu? Why would there be war?"</p><p></p><p>Yunze Cang's footsteps paused, and he let out a self-mocking laugh, then continued walking away, no longer looking at Zhang Yan.</p><p></p><p>Zhang Yan stood there dumbfounded, at a loss.</p><p></p><p>...</p><p></p><p>Observation Pavilion.</p><p></p><p>Lu Changsheng put away the ancient zither, brushed off his sleeves, and said very naturally:</p><p></p><p>"Who is sneaking around?"</p><p></p><p>Princess Ning's gaze changed, like a frightened rabbit, and she turned to flee.</p><p></p><p>"Take one more step and you die."</p><p></p><p>Lu Changsheng spoke without any emotion.</p><p></p><p>Princess Ning's whole body stiffened as if she had been electrocuted, freezing in place, not daring to move.</p><p></p><p>Lu Changsheng turned and stepped down from the stone wall, his eyes looking at the place behind the door, hands behind his back, speaking indifferently, "Come out."</p><p></p><p>After a moment, the person hiding behind the door still did not come out, not even daring to make the slightest sound.</p><p></p><p>Lu Changsheng saw this, his brow slightly raised, "Can you not understand human speech?"</p><p></p><p>Soon, Princess Ning's very nervous voice came from behind the door: "I, I don't know if I should move, you said I would die if I did..."</p><p></p><p>Lu Changsheng paused, then his eyes flashed!</p><p></p><p>With a "bang", the door of unknown material instantly shattered and collapsed!</p><p></p><p>This sudden scene frightened Princess Ning, making her turn pale with fright, crouching on the ground and covering her head.</p><p></p><p>"Who are you?"</p><p></p><p>Suddenly, the voice of the young man sounded in front of her.</p><p></p><p>Princess Ning caught the pleasant and comfortable scent from the man in front of her, her heart skipping a beat. She stiffly raised her head and saw the calm young man looking down at her, his handsome and transcendent appearance, and her previous tension suddenly dissipated for no reason.</p>

        <h1>Chapter 292</h1>
        <div class="content">
            <p>Here is the full English translation of the Chinese excerpt:</p><p></p><p>In an instant, all the supreme celestial lords remembered Lu Changsheng...</p><p></p><p>Many supreme celestial lords had a mocking and cold look in their eyes. This person not only lowered the bottom line of the Supreme Celestial Lord Assembly, but also stole a lot of the spotlight!</p><p></p><p>When they enter the secret realm, if they encounter him, they must teach him a lesson!</p><p></p><p>Evilcut, Nangong Wenxin, and other supreme celestial lords quickly averted their gaze and started to examine the other Saint Yang Realm celestial lords around them.</p><p></p><p>They were all arrogant, feeling that they had paid too much attention to a small Immortal Emperor Realm cultivator like him, which was too demeaning.</p><p></p><p>However, Blood Moon's eyes flashed with a strange color. She had seen this Immortal Emperor Realm cultivator during the test stone assessment a year ago, and due to his uniqueness, she still had some impression of him.</p><p></p><p>For some reason, this sole Immortal Emperor Realm celestial lord gave her a different feeling.</p><p></p><p>It felt like he was not as simple as he appeared on the surface.</p><p></p><p>"Ahem, ahem."</p><p></p><p>At this time, Duan Jiu Xiong cleared his throat, drawing everyone's attention back to him.</p><p></p><p>He loudly announced, "In this Sand Secret Realm, the simple goal is to determine the top 1,500 ranks!</p><p></p><p>What you need to do inside is to fight, fight, and fight some more! The saying 'the victor becomes king, the loser becomes a bandit' applies here. There are no rules in the Sand Secret Realm. </p><p></p><p>As long as you can survive until the last 1,500, you will have the qualifications to participate in the final Supreme Celestial Lord Tea Gathering, and there will be abundant rewards awaiting you, as well as the opportunity to become a sword servant of the Ancient Wasteland Divine Sword Clan!"</p><p></p><p>As his words fell, the eyes of many celestial lords burned with excitement!</p><p></p><p>The Saint Yang Realm celestial lords naturally wanted to become sword servants, while the Saint Origin Realm celestial lords and even more Immortal Ancestor Realm celestial lords were after the abundant rewards.</p><p></p><p>To put it bluntly, many of these celestial lords were treating the Supreme Celestial Lord Assembly as an opportunity for tempering, and obtaining the rewards for the top 1,500 was their primary goal.</p><p></p><p>Based on past experience, the rewards for the top 1,500 would be extremely generous, enough to make their clan prosper. After all, those rewards came from the Ancient Wasteland Divine Sword Clan!</p><p></p><p>As for becoming a sword servant of the Ancient Wasteland Divine Sword Clan, there were already 20 Saint Yang Realm celestial lords ahead of them, so they could be said to not even dare to dream about it, as the hope was too slim.</p><p></p><p>However, their expressions soon changed slightly.</p><p></p><p>What did it mean to survive until the last 1,500?</p><p></p><p>Could it be that the Sand Secret Realm would be sealed off after the start?</p><p></p><p>If that was the case, then out of these 100,000 celestial lords, wouldn't all but 1,500 have to die?</p><p></p><p>If that was the way it was, who would still dare to participate?</p><p></p><p>Seeing their reactions, Duan Jiu Xiong smiled and said, "Don't worry, the Sand Secret Realm is certainly not sealed off. All of you are the rare talents of our Ancient Wasteland Ruins, and we could not possibly let you all perish there in vain, as that would be a huge loss for our Ancient Wasteland Ruins."</p><p></p><p>After saying this, he tilted his head and gestured.</p><p></p><p>A guard behind him nodded and stepped forward, then with a vigorous wave of his hand, countless glowing points flew towards the celestial lords.</p><p></p><p>Duan Jiu Xiong smiled and said, "These jade tokens, one for each of you. In the Sand Secret Realm, if you want to give up, just crush the jade token, and you can come out. Of course... if some of you face danger and don't have time to crush the token, you'll end up dying in there uselessly, hehe."</p><p></p><p>The celestial lords caught the glowing points and looked at the jade tokens in their hands, finally letting out a sigh of relief. Having a safeguard was good.</p><p></p><p>"Oh, and one more thing, don't think you can hide and sneak your way through in the secret realm, it's useless. All of you who have passed the test stone assessment have been marked. No matter how you try to hide in there, you will all be sensed by each other as long as the distance is close enough, hehe."</p><p></p><p>Duan Jiu Xiong said mockingly, then his expression suddenly turned stern as he waved his hand and shouted, "Alright, enough nonsense, all celestial lords, quickly enter the Sand Secret Realm!!"</p><p></p><p>Immediately...</p><p></p><p>Here is the full English translation of the Chinese excerpt:</p><p></p><p>The tens of thousands of celestial champions swept across the sandy veil, like a plague of locusts!</p><p></p><p>Swoosh swoosh swooshâ€”</p><p></p><p>The dense sound of breaking through the air reverberated in this space, as the celestial champions disappeared into the sandy veil in groups.</p><p></p><p>Li Shuyan glanced at the motionless Lu Changsheng, then hurriedly plunged into the sandy veil.</p><p></p><p>He was certain that he had to go and fight to gain experience on his own, following the senior would not give him that sense of experience.</p><p></p><p>Soon, only the Fu siblings, Liu Xing, and Lu Changsheng remained motionless in the arena...</p><p></p><p>Suspicious gazes immediately converged on them from all around.</p><p></p><p>What's going on, did this Immortal Emperor realm celestial champion give up?</p><p></p><p>And what's the deal with those three Immortal Ancestor realm celestial champions?</p><p></p><p>The expressions of Fu Shiyu and the others were slightly embarrassed, not because they intentionally stayed behind.</p><p></p><p>It was because just as they were about to enter the sandy veil, they heard the senior's voice in their minds, telling them to follow along, and that he would bestow a bit of fortune upon their two clans.</p><p></p><p>"Hmm? You little fellows, why aren't you rushing into the secret realm?" </p><p></p><p>Duan Jiuniong looked at Lu Changsheng and the others, smiling.</p><p></p><p>Lu Changsheng paid him no heed, calmly striding towards the sandy veil.</p><p></p><p>Fu Shiyu and the others hurriedly followed.</p><p></p><p>"?"</p><p></p><p>Including Duan Jiuniong, everyone was stunned.</p><p></p><p>For a moment, they couldn't quite wrap their heads around it.</p><p></p><p>They had the illusion that those three Immortal Ancestor realm celestial champions seemed to be following that one Immortal Emperor realm celestial champion.</p><p></p><p>Before the crowd could recover, Lu Changsheng's group disappeared into the sandy veil.</p><p></p><p>Countless cultivators left outside were in disarray in the wind.</p><p></p><p>...</p><p></p><p>In the Sand Secret Realm,</p><p></p><p>As soon as Lu Changsheng's group entered, their clothes were whipped by the sandstorm, rustling loudly!</p><p></p><p>Whoosh whoosh whoosh, bang bang bang!</p><p></p><p>The fierce winds carrying sand and gravel pounded mercilessly on Fu Shiyu and the others. They hurriedly used their spiritual energy to shield themselves from the sand.</p><p></p><p>Looking up,</p><p></p><p>The world before them was a world of sand, a hazy yellow!</p><p></p><p>Amidst the storm, the echoes of numerous battle explosions and flashes of light could be heard!</p><p></p><p>It seems that the celestial champions who entered earlier had already begun fighting.</p><p></p><p>"Senior, senior."</p><p></p><p>Fu Shiyu and the others looked at the leading Lu Changsheng.</p><p></p><p>Lu Changsheng smiled and said as he walked, "Don't be nervous, just follow me and wander around in this secret realm."</p><p></p><p>Wander around? </p><p></p><p>The three were stunned for a moment, then slowly nodded and followed.</p><p></p><p>Lu Changsheng said, "You don't need to think about gaining experience either. With your strength, if you really go fight in this secret realm, you'll be eliminated very quickly."</p><p></p><p>"The senior is right." On this, Fu Shiyu and the others neither agreed nor disagreed.</p><p></p><p>They were not arrogant, and clearly knew their own capabilities.</p><p></p><p>"From now on, just follow me, and enter the top 1,500, to obtain that reward. Then your two clans won't have come here in vain."</p><p></p><p>Lu Changsheng said softly.</p><p></p><p>"Yes!"</p><p></p><p>Hearing this, Fu Shiyu and the others perked up!</p><p></p><p>They finally understood that the "bestowing a bit of fortune" the senior mentioned earlier meant this!</p><p></p><p>If they made it into the top 1,500,</p><p>and obtained that generous reward, it would be a tremendous windfall for their two clans!</p><p></p><p>"Let's go, find a place with less wind and sand to sit and wait for the Sand Secret Realm to end."</p><p></p><p>The corners of Lu Changsheng's mouth under the mask suddenly curved up slightly, as he fixed his gaze on a direction and led Fu Shiyu and the others that way.</p><p></p><p>Just after they disappeared, a few celestial champions appeared at the spot they had stood - a Spiritual Origin realm celestial champion and four Immortal Ancestor realm celestial champions.</p><p></p><p>Leading them, Miao Lun sneered as he looked in the direction Lu Changsheng had left, quickly following the trail left by the testing stone in his heart, coldly laughing,</p><p></p><p>"Let's go, go teach a lesson. Since they ran into us, this Immortal Emperor realm little one's luck is not good!"</p>

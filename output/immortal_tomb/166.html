        <h1>Chapter 166</h1>
        <div class="content">
            <p>Here is the full English translation of the Chinese excerpt:</p><p></p><p>Hearing such arrogant words, Jiang Chu and the others' expressions changed slightly. They stared intently at the man in blue, the more they observed him, the more puzzled and wary they became.</p><p></p><p>In their perception, the man in blue was like a cloud of mist, obscure and unfathomable.</p><p></p><p>But precisely because of this, his previous arrogant remarks made them even more apprehensive!</p><p></p><p>Lu Changsheng in his blue robe suddenly appeared in front of Peng Fang and the others, facing Jiang Chu and the group.</p><p></p><p>"Shopkeeper... they are the Jiang clan..." Peng Fang's expression was grave, but before he could finish, Lu Changsheng slightly raised his hand to interrupt him.</p><p></p><p>The incident that happened at the Changsheng Inn had already spread throughout the entire Qingxuan. Countless cultivators gathered like locusts, crowding in the outer circle to watch from afar. Even various shops, restaurants, and brothels had closed down and rushed over.</p><p></p><p>Among the sea of people, in addition to Su Qianghe and his group, one could even see some familiar faces, such as the madam of the Red Boudoir, Red Carp, and other brothel girls.</p><p></p><p>Not a single person dared to make a sound, the entire venue... no, one could say the entire Qingxuan Town was so quiet that the sound of a falling needle could be heard, unprecedented.</p><p></p><p>Everyone was nervously watching the scene, waiting for the situation to unfold.</p><p></p><p>They all knew how terrifying the lineup before Lu Changsheng was!</p><p></p><p>Two Transcendent Emperor Realm cultivators, one Transcendent Realm cultivator, and one Venerable Realm cultivator...</p><p></p><p>Even the weakest among them, the Venerable Realm cultivator, was an existence that many of them could only dream of.</p><p></p><p>It was rumored that the Shopkeeper's strength was between the Venerable Realm and the Transcendent Realm...</p><p></p><p>Today, the Shopkeeper might be in a bit of trouble.</p><p></p><p>But Jiang Chu's next words shocked everyone.</p><p></p><p>"Fellow Daoist, we do not wish to be your enemy. We just killed a few of your customers, and we will compensate you with spirit stones."</p><p></p><p>Jiang Chu stared at Lu Changsheng, his eyes flickering as he spoke.</p><p></p><p>Kunlun Jue and the Vice Palace Master beside him were somewhat disbelieving of Jiang Chu's surprisingly conciliatory attitude.</p><p></p><p>While the crowd was shocked, they also watched Lu Changsheng nervously, especially those who often drank at the Changsheng Inn. They did not know how Lu Changsheng would choose - would he fear the might of the Jiang Imperial Clan, or would he truly kill their inn customers, even if they were Transcendent Realm cultivators, as he had said earlier?</p><p></p><p>The entire venue stared silently at Lu Changsheng, waiting for his next move.</p><p></p><p>At this moment, Lu Changsheng chuckled lightly.</p><p></p><p>"Who gave you the audacity to stand and talk to me?"</p><p></p><p>The smile suddenly disappeared, and he said, "Kneel."</p><p></p><p>"You insolent!" Jiang Chu and the others' faces instantly showed anger.</p><p></p><p>But to their horror, they found that their knees, under a terrifying, powerful force, were involuntarily bending down!</p><p></p><p>Jiang Chu's face changed drastically as he looked down at his increasingly bending knees, disbelief filling his eyes. He roared while frantically circulating his Immortal Qi, "Get up for me!"</p><p></p><p>Jiang Chong, Kunlun Jue, and the Vice Palace Master were also desperately resisting that mysterious force!</p><p></p><p>But they were desperately dismayed to find that no matter what they did, no matter how they struggled, they could not budge it at all!</p><p></p><p>What's going on...?</p><p></p><p>Jiang Chu and the four of them suddenly looked up at Lu Changsheng, their eyes filled with difficulty.</p><p></p><p>Finally...</p><p></p><p>The four of them heavily knelt to the ground!</p><p></p><p>Boom!</p><p></p><p>The moment their knees touched the ground, a loud explosion suddenly erupted!</p><p></p><p>The ground immediately split into four or five parts, and the cracks spread in all directions.</p><p></p><p>Countless sand and debris were thrown up, and the air was filled with dust.</p><p></p><p>When the dust settled, the stunned crowd quickly looked over and saw a huge pit. In the pit, Jiang Chu and the four of them were kneeling there, their hair and clothes covered in sand, looking disheveled and miserable.</p><p></p><p>Here is the full English translation of the Chinese excerpt:</p><p></p><p>At the edge of the massive pit, Lü Changsheng stood silently.</p><p></p><p>"Sss—"</p><p></p><p>Every single person in the audience was stunned and had their scalp tingling from this sight.</p><p></p><p>Three Immortal Emperors and one Ninth-Grade Immortal Venerable had actually been so forcefully suppressed!</p><p></p><p>When had they ever witnessed such a soul-stirring scene?</p><p></p><p>"M-Master..."</p><p></p><p>Peng Fang, Zuo Choushan, and the others had extremely dry expressions on their faces. They never expected Lü Changsheng to act so mercilessly and explosively.</p><p></p><p>To make the two Immortal Emperors of the Jiang Clan kneel down... how was this any different from slapping the Jiang Clan's face?</p><p></p><p>And this was all done in front of the massive crowd. They couldn't even imagine how much of an uproar this incident would cause when it spread throughout the Black Demon Domain and even other regions of the Heavenly Scar!</p><p></p><p>They knew that from the moment Jiang Chu and Jiang Chong knelt down, this matter could no longer be easily resolved.</p><p></p><p>And... and the master's displayed strength... made everyone tremble even more.</p><p></p><p>The madam of the Red Boudoir Courtyard and the girls like Hong Li had already turned deathly pale, secretly relieved that Lü Changsheng didn't settle accounts with them that day.</p><p></p><p>Too powerful...</p><p></p><p>"Fellow Daoist, do you know... that this is publicly slapping the face of our Jiang Clan?" </p><p></p><p>At this moment, Jiang Chu suddenly raised his head and shouted furiously.</p><p></p><p>His lips were trembling, not knowing whether it was from hatred or fear.</p><p></p><p>Lü Changsheng calmly replied, "The Jiang Clan? What is that? Are they more important than my customers?"</p><p></p><p>Hearing this, many cultivators who had long been drinking at the inn had their eyes glazed over, their mouths slightly open, and their bodies trembling slightly as a scorching heat uncontrollably surged up to their heads.</p><p></p><p>How could they not adore a master who so staunchly protected his customers?</p><p></p><p>When had they ever heard such domineering words about the Jiang Clan?</p><p></p><p>"You!" Jiang Chu and Jiang Chong's faces turned ferocious.</p><p></p><p>But Kunlun Jue and the Vice Palace Master regained their senses, their hearts trembling. If they had known it would turn out this way, they... they wouldn't have gotten involved in this mess.</p><p></p><p>Lü Changsheng smiled slightly. "I, Lü Changsheng, have always been a man of my word... Today, not only will I trample on your Jiang Clan, but I will also kill you all... I want to see who else dares to cause trouble on my turf in the future."</p><p></p><p>As the words fell, Jiang Chu and the others' pupils shrank!</p><p></p><p>The crowd's hearts trembled even more, their attention fully focused.</p><p></p><p>The next moment,</p><p></p><p>Lü Changsheng raised his right hand, holding up two fingers in front of his chest.</p><p></p><p>A wisp of sword qi slowly appeared, circling around the two fingers.</p><p></p><p>"Clang..."</p><p></p><p>The moment the sword qi appeared, countless sword cries resounded through the heavens and earth, piercingly sharp, as if they wanted to tear apart this world.</p><p></p><p>The crowd's eyes were filled with terror and shock. They hurriedly activated their immortal qi to block their ears, but it had no effect at all, as the fierce sword cries echoed in their minds.</p><p></p><p>In the pit, the sword qi locked onto Jiang Chu and the others, causing their ears to bleed, their faces changing drastically in an instant!</p><p></p><p>They stared at the tiny sword qi with great difficulty, finally feeling fear in their hearts!</p><p></p><p>Kunlun Jue's eyes were bloodshot as he urgently shouted, "Senior! I was just accompanying them. I have no relation to the Jiang Clan at all!!"</p><p></p><p>The Vice Palace Master also wanted to beg for mercy, but didn't know what to say, as he had just crushed some cultivators in the queue earlier.</p><p></p><p>Lü Changsheng's expression was indifferent, his long black hair swaying without wind.</p><p></p><p>He slightly moved his hand, and the wisp of sword qi rushed towards them!!</p><p></p><p>Clang—!</p><p></p><p>Jiang Chu was frightened and panting heavily, the terror of death weighing him down unbearably. He shouted in terror, "How dare you! We are the Jiang Clan!!!"</p><p></p><p>Lü Changsheng stood with his hands behind his back. Despite holding a sword that could kill, his expression was calm, and his words, which drowned out the fierce sword cries echoing through the venue, were spoken with a faint smile.</p><p></p><p>"I, Lü Changsheng, dare anything."</p>

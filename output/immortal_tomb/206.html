        <h1>Chapter 206</h1>
        <div class="content">
            <p>Here is the full English translation of the Chinese excerpt:</p><p></p><p>At this moment, the heavens and earth fell silent. ‚ô®üêö‚ûÖ‚ùæùêí ∞ùì§◊ê.ùêÇùïÜùê¶üêù‚ôó</p><p></p><p>Countless gazes carefully looked towards Fu Mingyan, and sure enough, his expression had turned unpleasant!</p><p></p><p>The six people behind Fu Mingyan, sensing his anger, had their hearts racing wildly!</p><p></p><p>Among them, the middle-aged man immediately stepped forward and shouted, "What kind of sect are you! Do you even understand the rules!"</p><p></p><p>Facing his words, Peng Fang did not bother to respond, but looked at Fu Mingyan and said indifferently, "There's no need to talk about rules or no rules anymore, that would just waste time. Let all the sects here attack my Xiaoyao Sect, as long as my Xiaoyao Sect wins, then the first place will be ours."</p><p></p><p>As soon as these words fell, the entire venue fell into complete silence.</p><p></p><p>Suddenly, countless mocking, derisive, and disdainful words came pouring down:</p><p></p><p>"Ridiculous, the most ridiculous thing under the heavens!"</p><p></p><p>"What kind of bullshit Xiaoyao Sect, I've never even heard of it, do you want to be famous that badly?"</p><p></p><p>"Yes, wanting to fight against all the sects here, you're really going crazy, just my Juba Sect alone can crush your shitty Xiaoyao Sect!"</p><p></p><p>"......"</p><p></p><p>Listening to the overwhelming discussions, Fan Hong finally stood up and laughed happily, "Haha, all you sect masters, you don't know, this Xiaoyao Sect and my Huoyan Pavilion are both sects in the southern region of Canglan Zhou, but today, I, the Pavilion Master, am ashamed to be associated with them! The Xiaoyao Sect has truly brought disgrace to our Canglan Zhou!"</p><p></p><p>It was the Nihong Pavilion's people who remained silent.</p><p></p><p>Just then,</p><p></p><p>Under Zhu Xingqiu's eye signal, an attendant from the Xiaoyao Sect camp suddenly flashed in front of the self-satisfied Fan Hong!</p><p></p><p>A dazzling short blade appeared in his hand,</p><p></p><p>The short blade spun elegantly in his hand for a few circles, and then his body leaned forward, ruthlessly slashing across Fan Hong's neck!</p><p></p><p>Shua!!!</p><p></p><p>Instantly, a gush of fresh blood!</p><p></p><p>Fan Hong's expression stiffened, looking at the elder in disbelief.</p><p></p><p>The next moment, Fan Hong fell to the ground unwillingly, a wisp of red light flashed from his Dantian, trying to escape, but was instantly severed by the elder's short blade.</p><p></p><p>This series of events happened in the blink of an eye, and everyone was unable to react!</p><p></p><p>The venue was deathly silent, the throats of all the sect masters seemed to be grasped, wanting to speak but daring not to make a sound.</p><p></p><p>"Pavilion... Pavilion Master!!" The Huoyan Pavilion's elders and disciples were shocked and cried out in grief, but their hearts soon became panicked,</p><p></p><p>Because the elder who had easily killed their Pavilion Master was now rushing towards them with the glowing short blade, wanting to kill them all!</p><p></p><p>This was an attack on the face of the Xuanhuang Sect!</p><p></p><p>Chen He looked up at the palace in terror, shouting without restraint, "Elder! Are you just going to watch him commit this act of violence in this venue? He is disgracing the Xuanhuang Sect, Elder!"</p><p></p><p>"Insolent!" Fu Mingyan finally snapped out of it, shouting furiously, his eyes burning with endless wrath!</p><p></p><p>Hearing this, the middle-aged man among the six behind him hurriedly rushed down, ready to rescue.</p><p></p><p>The Xiaoyao Sect attendant sensed the approaching aura from behind, his expression indifferent and unmoved, holding the glowing short blade like a top-notch assassin!</p><p></p><p>He suddenly rushed towards the Huoyan Pavilion camp! </p><p></p><p>Since the Huoyan Pavilion has insulted their Xiaoyao Sect, then everyone must die!!</p><p></p><p>Shua shua shua...!</p><p></p><p>"Ah ah ah!"</p><p></p><p>In the venue, the agonizing screams of the Huoyan Pavilion's elders and disciples echoed, their lives being harvested by the Xiaoyao Sect attendant like the Grim Reaper.</p><p></p><p>"Help! Somebody save my Huoyan Pavilion!" Chen He cried out in despair and terror.</p><p></p><p>Here is the full English translation of the Chinese excerpt:</p><p></p><p>"Dare you!!" The middle-aged man's eyes were bloodshot, he had finally arrived!</p><p></p><p>At this moment, </p><p></p><p>In the Xiaoyao Sect camp, Zhu Xingqiu narrowed his eyes and moved his body!</p><p></p><p>The next moment, he appeared in front of the middle-aged man, with an expressionless palm strike!</p><p></p><p>The middle-aged man's expression changed drastically, wanting to evade but it was too late!</p><p></p><p>This palm strike directly hit his chest!</p><p></p><p>Crack!</p><p></p><p>The middle-aged man's chest visibly caved in!</p><p></p><p>"Pu‚Äî"</p><p></p><p>He violently coughed up a mouthful of blood, blasted away and crashed into the palace, causing the entire palace to shake!</p><p></p><p>At the same time, the Xiaoyao Sect's steward also completed the harvest!</p><p></p><p>He licked the blood on the blade, revealing a sinister smile, following the sect master to Linglang Tian, establishing the Xiaoyao Sect, and lying low for many years.</p><p></p><p>Today, he finally regained some of the feeling of the Black Sha Domain......</p><p></p><p>At this point, the Blood Flame Hall and the previous slanderers were all dead!!</p><p></p><p>Everyone's expressions changed!</p><p></p><p>They were shocked to see the Xiaoyao Sect's steward, shocked to see Zhu Xingqiu, shocked to see the Xiaoyao Sect!!</p><p></p><p>The Xiaoyao Sect disciples' faces were filled with excitement, but the newly promoted disciples had extremely dry throats!!</p><p></p><p>They re-recognized their own sect! It was simply too powerful!</p><p></p><p>At this time, even the people on the palace, such as Fu Mingyan and Lei Yu, had completely solemn expressions!</p><p></p><p>This Xiaoyao Sect that they had never heard of... what was going on!!</p><p></p><p>A Ninth-Grade Sect???</p><p></p><p>The current strength displayed by the Xiaoyao Sect, even if they were to say it was a Fourth-Grade or even a Third-Grade Sect, they would believe it!</p><p></p><p>Fu Mingyan took a light breath, his gaze sweeping over the Xiaoyao Sect's steward and Zhu Xingqiu, finally resting on Peng Fang.</p><p></p><p>He said indifferently, "The strength of your Xiaoyao Sect doesn't quite fit the rules of the Ninth-Grade Competition... With such strength, to come to the Ninth-Grade Sect Competition and bloodily slaughter the other sects, isn't that ridiculous?"</p><p></p><p>Peng Fang did not speak, bloodily slaughter? How ridiculous, since they entered this extreme cold ice field, when had they ever taken the initiative to act against any sect.</p><p></p><p>If it were not for the upcoming competition, and the application for a grade above Ninth-Grade being somewhat troublesome, their Xiaoyao Sect would not have come here to farm the weeds.</p><p></p><p>Moreover, for their Xiaoyao Sect, anything below First-Grade is basically just farming the weeds.</p><p></p><p>They came here, not targeting anyone, but with only one goal!</p><p></p><p>That is to surpass the level!!</p><p></p><p>Behind him, Zhao Wuyu slowly stepped out.</p><p></p><p>He looked at Fu Mingyan and said with a faint smile, "Our Xiaoyao Sect only wants the first place, what's this talk about bloodily slaughtering? How, if others insult our Xiaoyao Sect, is it unreasonable for us to kill them?"</p><p></p><p>Fu Mingyan's mouth opened slightly, somewhat at a loss for words.</p><p></p><p>Zhao Wuyu then chuckled lightly, the fierce light flashing in his eyes behind the mask, and continued, "You seem unable to empathize, huh? Then how about this, your Xuanhuo Sect is just a piece of shit... Hehe, how does that taste?"</p><p></p><p>As these words fell, the entire venue was in an uproar!</p><p></p><p>"You‚Äî Outrageous!!"</p><p></p><p>Fu Mingyan's eyes widened with rage, in his entire life, he had never been so furious as he was at this moment!</p><p></p><p>Zhao Wuyu laughed heartily, unintimidated, instead slowly levitating in the midst of countless gazes,</p><p></p><p>His eyes behind the mask staring directly at Fu Mingyan, sneering, "I'm just being outrageous ‚Äî what can you do about it!!"</p><p></p><p>Directly provoking the First-Grade Xuanhuo Sect!!</p><p></p><p>All the sects were already stunned, the development of the situation, no one could understand it anymore.</p><p></p><p>But the Xiaoyao Sect disciples were shocked by their elder's actions, their blood boiling with excitement, exhilarated beyond measure!</p><p></p><p>Their Xiaoyao Sect, dormant for years, finally revealed its fangs today.</p>

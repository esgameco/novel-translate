        <h1>Chapter 511</h1>
        <div class="content">
            <p>Here is the full English translation of the Chinese excerpt:</p><p></p><p>"Gulp, gulp..."</p><p></p><p>The beings couldn't help but swallow their saliva.</p><p></p><p>That Nicole, although she was a Holy Demon Soldier, was no ordinary Holy Demon Soldier!</p><p></p><p>To be casually taken down like that!</p><p></p><p>The beings had never seen someone so fierce and decisive before!</p><p></p><p>Involuntarily, a faint glimmer of hope they themselves didn't even believe in surfaced in their hearts.</p><p></p><p>It had been too long, they had already become numb.</p><p></p><p>"Lord Xin Xia, there are foreign beings who have intruded and killed Nicole."</p><p></p><p>Jack also reported it decisively.</p><p></p><p>His gaze was fixed on Lu Changsheng, with a look as if he wanted to devour him alive.</p><p></p><p>Now in the mother star system of the Creation Pillar, it was the Void Holy Demons who were reigning supreme. Could he still be afraid of this young man in green?</p><p></p><p>Even if his head was severed and his blood flowed, he couldn't lose his momentum.</p><p></p><p>Lu Changsheng smiled slightly and said indifferently with his hands behind his back, "Give them a lesson."</p><p></p><p>At his words, the Holy Demon Soldiers were somewhat dazed.</p><p></p><p>And the next moment, the Reincarnation Demon Child behind Lu Changsheng gleefully pounced out, "Let me handle this!"</p><p></p><p>Old Turtle and Hunhun, who were about to make a move, could only twist their mouths and remain in place. This Reincarnation Demon Child really liked to steal the limelight.</p><p></p><p>"Stop him!" Jack's eyes narrowed as he shouted.</p><p></p><p>At his words, the surrounding Holy Demon Soldiers dispersed their formation, flapping their wings and attacking the Reincarnation Demon Child. Their sharp claws on their limbs suddenly grew larger, as sharp as the most refined steel blades, gleaming with a keen edge!</p><p></p><p>Hatred flashed in the Reincarnation Demon Child's eyes. "Do you think I'll be afraid of you Holy Demon Soldiers?"</p><p></p><p>After a cold laugh, the Reincarnation Demon Child suddenly took a deep breath, and his mouth opened wide like an abyss!</p><p></p><p>Immediately, a violent suction force erupted, causing the space to tremble, the earth to shake, and the airflow to become savage!</p><p></p><p>The Holy Demon Soldiers were horrified, hastily landing on the ground and firmly stabbing their sharp claws into the ground, trying to resist this suction force!</p><p></p><p>But it was to no avail, as the airflow swept everything away, and the Holy Demon Soldiers were soon sucked in!</p><p></p><p>"Captain Jack, save us!"</p><p></p><p>At this, Jack did not move, but his gaze was fierce as he stared at the Reincarnation Demon Child with his gaping abyss-like mouth, then swept his vision over Old Turtle and the others, finally resting on Lu Changsheng.</p><p></p><p>Where did these beings come from?</p><p></p><p>Soon, all the Holy Demon Soldiers were sucked into the Reincarnation Demon Child's mouth.</p><p></p><p>The Reincarnation Demon Child licked the corner of his mouth, then looked at Jack!</p><p></p><p>Jack's heart trembled, as he was the only Holy Demon Soldier left.</p><p></p><p>Just then, a spatial rift opened behind him, and thousands upon thousands of Void Holy Demons surged out from the spatial rift!</p><p></p><p>Among them, there were even three Void Holy Demon Generals with four pairs of wings!</p><p></p><p>Seeing the Void Holy Demon Generals, Jack was overjoyed. He knew that Lord Xin Xia had arrived, so he hurriedly went to the spatial rift and bowed respectfully.</p><p></p><p>"Welcome, Lord Xin Xia!"</p><p></p><p>As Jack's respectful greeting fell, the beings trembled in their hearts as they watched the last Void Holy Demon with three pairs of wings slowly step out from the spatial rift.</p><p></p><p>Xin Xia!</p><p></p><p>The Void Holy Demon King Xin Xia!</p><p></p><p>They were all too familiar with him!</p><p></p><p>In the past, it was Void Holy Demon King Xin Xia who led countless Void Holy Demons to invade their Crimson Profound Heaven!</p><p></p><p>The peak experts of Crimson Profound Heaven were all crushed by his hands, without the slightest ability to fight back!</p><p></p><p>Even the Dao of Crimson Profound Heaven, fearing Xin Xia, had hidden away somewhere!</p><p></p><p>The moment Xin Xia appeared, the Reincarnation Demon Child looked at the three pairs of wings behind him, and his expression suddenly darkened!</p><p></p><p>If he could casually kill the Holy Demon Soldiers, he could also manage the Holy Demon Generals, but the Void Holy Demon King, he might find it a bit challenging!</p><p></p><p>This meant that the Void Holy Demons were incredibly powerful. Even the Void Holy Demon King had already put pressure on the Reincarnation Demon Child. Then how powerful would the Void Holy Demon Emperor, Void Holy Demon Lord, and Void Holy Demon God be?</p><p></p><p>This Void Holy Demon King with three pairs of wings had combat power that was off the charts.</p><p></p><p>Here is the full English translation of the Chinese excerpt:</p><p></p><p>His physical body was extremely hard and unyielding!</p><p></p><p>For the Saint-Demon King, the countless worlds in the boundless void were already within his power to easily destroy!</p><p></p><p>However, the worlds within the mother star system were different. As the supporting pillars of creation, they were extremely difficult to destroy. Therefore, the Saint-Devouring Demon adopted a relatively slow method of gnawing and devouring, with another purpose being to collect the absorbed energy in the most perfect way to present to their superiors. But the energy that could be collected had to be from Saint-Devouring Demons of Xin Xi'a's level or above.</p><p></p><p>The Saint-Demon soldiers and generals only needed to obediently follow orders to gnaw and devour, while the energy spilling out would be collected by the Saint-Demon King.</p><p></p><p>If they truly wanted to destroy the Crimson-Obscure Mysterious Heaven, Xin Xi'a could do it by spending time, but it would be a waste of energy and not worth it.</p><p></p><p>Old Turtle and Hunhun looked gravely at Xin Xi'a, not out of fear, but because the aura of the Saint-Devouring Demons was so obscure and unfathomable in its power, leaving them feeling very uncomfortable with this unknown.</p><p></p><p>It was clear that the cultivation system of the Saint-Devouring Demons was completely different from their boundless void.</p><p></p><p>"What's going on?" Xin Xi'a indifferently glanced at Lu Changsheng and the others.</p><p></p><p>Jack hurriedly said, "Lord Xin Xi'a, while Nico and I were watching over these slaves, these living beings suddenly arrived and without a word killed Nico, and then they didn't stop there, they even killed hundreds of Saint-Demon soldiers! They even wanted to kill me!"</p><p></p><p>"These insolent living beings, please Lord Xin Xi'a deal with them!"</p><p></p><p>Hearing this, Xin Xi'a looked towards the group opposite, more precisely at Lu Changsheng.</p><p></p><p>"You all must be from outside the Creation Pillar, right?"</p><p></p><p>Old Turtle and Hunhun were slightly shaken in their hearts, their leader's monster had unexpectedly determined their origin so decisively.</p><p></p><p>Lu Changsheng's eyes were calm as he asked, "Are you the one in charge of these maggots in this world?"</p><p></p><p>Maggots?</p><p></p><p>The Saint-Devouring Demons were stunned for a moment, then immediately erupted in towering fury! This living being actually called their supreme Saint-Devouring Demons "maggots"? Maggots?</p><p></p><p>The Saint-Devouring Demons instantly became restless, baring their teeth and looking ferocious, but without Xin Xi'a's order, they could only tightly control themselves.</p><p></p><p>"Lowly being, some words will cost you your life..."</p><p></p><p>Xin Xi'a stared at Lu Changsheng, speaking in an extremely slow pace.</p><p></p><p>Suddenly, Lu Changsheng's figure disappeared and flashed in front of Xin Xi'a!</p><p></p><p>Although Lu Changsheng was tall, in front of the Saint-Demon King Xin Xi'a, who was several zhang (about 10 meters) tall, he was like a small child.</p><p></p><p>Xin Xi'a looked down at the young man in blue, his pupils constricting!</p><p></p><p>Before Xin Xi'a could speak, Lu Changsheng calmly said, "Kneel down and talk to me, or do you want me to look up at you?"</p><p></p><p>Xin Xi'a's pupils shrank, a fierce and murderous aura flashing in his eyes, and he suddenly swung his sharp claws without warning!</p><p></p><p>Swoosh--!</p><p></p><p>"You damned insect!!"</p><p></p><p>Xin Xi'a struck with his claws, not wanting to see the result, confident that this young man in blue would die under his sharp claws!</p><p></p><p>However!</p><p></p><p>Lu Changsheng simply raised his left hand and lightly pinched Xin Xi'a's claws with just two fingers!</p><p></p><p>Then, with a sudden twist, Xin Xi'a's entire arm was torn off!</p><p></p><p>Xin Xi'a blankly felt the emptiness of his shoulder, and although the Saint-Devouring Demons had no sense of pain, their bodies were still extremely hard, let alone him, a Saint-Demon King!</p><p></p><p>Xin Xi'a finally changed color, his expression becoming grave!</p><p></p><p>This insect... is quite formidable!</p>

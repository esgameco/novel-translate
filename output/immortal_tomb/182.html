        <h1>Chapter 182</h1>
        <div class="content">
            <p>Here is the full English translation of the Chinese excerpt:</p><p></p><p>The deep, dense forest surrounded them. 69shux.com</p><p></p><p>The trees here were towering, and the foliage was even thicker than the outer areas. Although some sunlight managed to penetrate through, it only scattered in droplets on the ground.</p><p></p><p>Faint beast roars echoed from within the forest, shaking one's soul.</p><p></p><p>Not far away, hundreds of figures were seated, as if resting or waiting for someone.</p><p></p><p>"Elder Brother, the Three Pure Palaces and the Scorching Sun Valley have formed an alliance, those bastards!" </p><p></p><p>Boom!</p><p></p><p>At this moment, a young man burst out from the undergrowth, punching a nearby tree in frustration, causing the tree to tremble and the leaves to sway.</p><p></p><p>The disciples of the Heaven Dragon Sect were just joyful that their Third Senior Brother had returned, but upon hearing this news, their expressions turned grave.</p><p></p><p>The alliance between the Three Pure Palaces and the Scorching Sun Valley was unexpected, yet understandable.</p><p></p><p>Xiao Yan opened his eyes, a flash of fire in his gaze, and he smiled, "Third Junior Brother, calm down. Let them form an alliance, it's not something we couldn't have anticipated. If they didn't ally, they wouldn't have a chance to seize the points."</p><p></p><p>Seeing their Elder Brother so composed, the disciples also felt relieved.</p><p></p><p>Indeed, with their Elder Brother in charge, what did they have to fear? Their Elder Brother was the number one genius of the Heaven Dragon Sect, with his godly fire control abilities!</p><p></p><p>Xiao Yan flipped his hand, and a token appeared. He raised his head and addressed the disciples, "Fellow Junior Brothers and Sisters, take out your point tokens and let's tally up the total points we have in the Heaven Dragon Sect."</p><p></p><p>"Yes."</p><p></p><p>The disciples promptly took out their tokens, and after infusing them with spiritual energy, the tokens lit up, and numerous numbers projected into the air.</p><p></p><p>"Nine, nine, eighteen, twenty-six, thirty-seven..."</p><p></p><p>Xiao Yan's gaze swept across the numbers, silently counting.</p><p></p><p>At this moment, the disciples were stunned, for the projection in front of Xiao Yan showed the number 666!</p><p></p><p>How many demonic beasts had they slain?</p><p></p><p>Truly their Elder Brother was remarkable!</p><p></p><p>Soon, Xiao Yan smiled in satisfaction, "The total points we have accumulated are four thousand one hundred and sixteen. These points are enough to crush the Three Pure Palaces and the Scorching Sun Valley. From now on, we no longer need to hunt demonic beasts, let's just wait for them to arrive and engage in the final battle."</p><p></p><p>The disciples were invigorated upon hearing this!</p><p></p><p>If the Three Pure Palaces and the Scorching Sun Valley had not allied, there would still be about a month left in the trial. But with their alliance, the trial might end sooner.</p><p></p><p>Just then, Xiao Yan's expression changed slightly, and he abruptly stood up, shouting, "They're here, prepare for battle!"</p><p></p><p>The disciples were startled and quickly stood up.</p><p></p><p>In the next moment, the sound of countless figures bursting through the undergrowth filled the air!</p><p></p><p>In just a moment, the Heaven Dragon Sect disciples found themselves surrounded by twice as many figures.</p><p></p><p>The Heaven Dragon Sect disciples were now facing a formidable enemy.</p><p></p><p>"Hehe, Xiao Yan, I'm sure you anticipated our alliance, didn't you?" The senior disciple of the Three Pure Palaces sneered.</p><p></p><p>Xiao Yan's expression remained impassive.</p><p></p><p>Seeing this, Zhang Sheng from the Scorching Sun Valley laughed, "Cold Brother, we don't need to waste time talking to the Heaven Dragon Sect. I'm sure Xiao Yan is unwilling to hand over the points, so let's just start the battle."</p><p></p><p>Cold Qing's smile faded, and he looked at Xiao Yan, "Xiao Yan, I'll ask you one last time, are you willing to hand over the points? Otherwise, you can't blame us for the heavy casualties in the Heaven Dragon Sect."</p><p></p><p>"Enough nonsense, Heaven Dragon Sect disciples, attack on my command!" Xiao Yan sneered and then charged towards Cold Qing and Zhang Sheng.</p><p></p><p>"Kill! Seize the points from the Heaven Dragon Sect!"</p><p>"Kill!!!"</p><p></p><p>In the blink of an eye, the area had become a battlefield, with the disciples of the three sects engaged in a chaotic battle, under the raging spiritual energy and various esoteric techniques. Trees were falling all around them.</p><p></p><p>Xiao Yan wielded flames in both hands, fighting Zhang Sheng and Cold Qing, yet he was not at a disadvantage, even seeming to have the upper hand.</p><p></p><p>This left Zhang Sheng and Cold Qing feeling alarmed and...</p><p></p><p>Here is the full English translation of the Chinese excerpt:</p><p></p><p>Well, they were not too panicked, still holding the winning hand.</p><p></p><p>Visit 69shu.com</p><p></p><p>Xiao Yan did not feel too proud, because it was difficult for him to achieve absolute dominance in the short term.</p><p></p><p>In this way, even though the situation here was still fine, the disciples of the Tianlong Sect would soon be besieged and defeated by the disciples of the two sects.</p><p></p><p>"Haha, Xiao Yan, we admit that you are very strong, but is it of any use? When all your Tianlong Sect disciples have fallen, what will you use to fight against us?" </p><p></p><p>Leng Qing narrowly dodged Xiao Yan's flames, secretly heaving a sigh of relief, and then sneered.</p><p></p><p>He tried to disturb Xiao Yan's mind with his words.</p><p></p><p>Boom! Boom! Boom!</p><p></p><p>The battlefield was extremely intense, and no one noticed.</p><p></p><p>A figure in blue robes appeared in the nearby woods, silently watching them.</p><p></p><p>Who is this man in blue robes if not Lu Changsheng?</p><p></p><p>Lu Changsheng watched the battle in the arena with amusement, as if it were children playing house, and after a while, he turned and headed deeper into the Extreme Gloomy Forest.</p><p></p><p>At this moment,</p><p></p><p>Xiao Yan, while fighting, scanned the situation of his Tianlong Sect disciples around him, and suddenly his gaze fell on Lu Changsheng. Without hesitation, he shouted loudly,</p><p></p><p>"Fellow Daoist, please wait! I beg you to help my Tianlong Sect, and I will reward you generously afterwards!"</p><p></p><p>Hmm?</p><p></p><p>Suddenly, the intense battle in the arena paused for a moment, and everyone looked over with suspicion.</p><p></p><p>They were shocked to see that there was indeed a person there.</p><p></p><p>Zhang Sheng and Leng Qing's expressions changed slightly, and they were about to also try to get Lu Changsheng to not interfere, but they were stunned to see...</p><p></p><p>That figure in blue robes, as if he had not heard, disappeared into the woods...</p><p></p><p>"Haha, Xiao Yan! Do you think everyone is eager for your little reward? This time, your Tianlong Sect is finally going to fall!"</p><p></p><p>Leng Qing laughed loudly, and then he and Zhang Sheng fiercely attacked.</p><p></p><p>"Damn it!" Xiao Yan's anger flared up at these words, and the flames around him suddenly erupted, burning many nearby trees!</p><p></p><p>The intense battle broke out again.</p><p></p><p>At the same time,</p><p></p><p>Lu Changsheng's footsteps were swift, and he had already left the outer circle and entered the inner circle.</p><p></p><p>Thinking about the previous events, he couldn't help but smile a little. A bunch of children fighting, and they still wanted to drag him in - how ridiculous.</p><p></p><p>If it had something to do with him, it would be no problem to lend a hand, but the problem was that it had nothing to do with him, he was just full.</p><p></p><p>Moreover, the so-called generous reward could not excite him at all. He didn't even value the treasures of the Chen clan's imperial family, which were given to Tongxin and Lin Dong as trash, so what treasures could these children offer.</p><p></p><p>After entering the inner circle, the surroundings became even darker, and the dense foliage blocked out any trace of sunlight.</p><p></p><p>There were also no more beast roars reaching his ears, it was deathly silent.</p><p></p><p>Lu Changsheng had a blade of grass in his mouth, his hands clasped behind his back, leisurely advancing deeper.</p><p></p><p>Occasionally, some short-sighted demonic beasts would attack, but they were scared away by Lu Changsheng's calm gaze.</p><p></p><p>Lu Changsheng couldn't be bothered to deal with these small demonic beasts.</p><p></p><p>Perhaps in others' eyes, these were terrifying and powerful demonic beasts, but in Lu Changsheng's eyes, they were no different from harmless little ants, without the slightest threat.</p><p></p><p>At this moment, a playful gleam flashed in Lu Changsheng's eyes.</p><p></p><p>Presumably, the Battle clan's imperial family has already met the so-called Ancestral Beast by now...</p><p></p><p>At the same time,</p><p></p><p>In the depths of the Extreme Gloomy Forest,</p><p></p><p>The Battle clan's imperial family had indeed reached the domain of the Ancestral Beast.</p><p></p><p>When the Ancestral Beast saw Battle Shanhai, he was dumbfounded.</p><p></p><p>He didn't understand why Battle Shanhai had come all the way from the Holy Immortal Realm to his Extreme Gloomy Forest?</p><p></p><p>And he even brought his whole family, a vast and grand sight, it seemed the entire clan had come over?</p><p></p><p>And he didn't even give a heads up beforehand, how rude.</p><p></p><p>The next moment, Battle Shanhai flashed in front of the Ancestral Beast, his expression grim as he growled,</p><p></p><p>"Ancestral Beast, Lu Changsheng... Lu Changsheng has reached the Heavenly Scar!"</p><p></p><p>Ancestral Beast: "Ah?"</p>

        <h1>Chapter 73</h1>
        <div class="content">
            <p>Here is the full English translation of the Chinese excerpt:</p><p></p><p>The woman in the white dress had a slightly narrowed gaze!</p><p></p><p>Powerful in strength, able to do as she pleased?</p><p></p><p>However, she was not particularly surprised by such bold words.</p><p></p><p>She finally turned her gaze to the silent young man in the blue robe.</p><p></p><p>Before she could examine him closely, the old turtle waved his hand and shouted, "Alright, quickly bring out that peerless nectar from your restaurant, don't keep my master waiting, the consequences of which you cannot bear. Don't worry, the payment for the wine will not be lacking!"</p><p></p><p>Chu Xiran paused upon hearing this, pondering for a moment, then said indifferently, "You may withdraw."</p><p></p><p>"Yes..."</p><p></p><p>The female cultivator rose, bowed and retreated, then flew towards the lakeside.</p><p></p><p>As for her own master, she was not at all worried, after all, even Jiang Yuan couldn't get the better of the master.</p><p></p><p>Chu Xiran pursed her lips and sat down in the only remaining seat at the stone table, under the bewildered gaze of Gu Helin.</p><p></p><p>Her next words left Gu Helin's mind struck by lightning!</p><p></p><p>"You two... must be from the Immortal Realms."</p><p></p><p>Immortal, Immortal Realms!</p><p></p><p>Gu Helin's chest heaved violently, although he had already guessed that Lu Changsheng and the old turtle were not from this world, hearing someone state it directly still left him shaken.</p><p></p><p>After all, guesses are always just guesses.</p><p></p><p>The old turtle was not surprised, smiling indifferently and spreading his hands proudly, "What else?"</p><p></p><p>He had known from the first time he saw this woman in white that she was also not from this mortal realm.</p><p></p><p>The old turtle knew that Lu Changsheng must have also realized this long ago.</p><p></p><p>Hearing this, Chu Xiran smiled, a brilliant smile, just as she had expected.</p><p></p><p>She had been waiting for this day for a long time.</p><p></p><p>The next moment, without further ado, she lightly waved her sleeve, and a beautifully decorated bottle of fine wine appeared on the table, its surface adorned with countless brilliant threads, forming a vast ocean scene, and the expanse of the heavens.</p><p></p><p>And not to mention the wine within, even the bottle itself was likely a treasure.</p><p></p><p>"Fellow Daoists, this is the peerless nectar that can only be obtained by presenting that plaque, please enjoy!"</p><p></p><p>Chu Xiran said generously, then casually erected a shielding barrier in the pavilion, and removed the stopper, immediately a fragrance surpassing the spring breeze by countless times wafted out.</p><p></p><p>Gu Helin swallowed hard, dumbfounded.</p><p></p><p>The aroma, so fragrant, he swore he had never smelled such an exquisite wine before, the fragrance made his spiritual energy surge violently after just one whiff.</p><p></p><p>Truly, this wine should only be found in the heavens, rarely encountered in the mortal realm.</p><p></p><p>The silent Lu Changsheng suddenly spoke in a faint voice, "Azure Sea Immortal Celestial Brew."</p><p></p><p>Chu Xiran's beautiful eyes shone with admiration, "Fellow Daoist is truly a connoisseur, this is indeed the Azure Sea Immortal Celestial Brew!"</p><p></p><p>At the same time, Chu Xiran's heart was increasingly excited!</p><p></p><p>Yes, yes, this young man in blue and the old hunchback must be from the Immortal Realms without a doubt!</p><p></p><p>Otherwise, they could not possibly know the name of this fine wine, for this realm does not have the Azure Sea Immortal Celestial Brew, it is a product of the Immortal Realms!</p><p></p><p>Lu Changsheng spoke softly, "You hung a plaque that can only be engraved with immortal spiritual power, nothing more than a faint hope, wanting to find someone from the Immortal Realms in this world."</p><p></p><p>The old turtle nodded in agreement, although he hadn't paid much attention to the plaque before the appearance of the woman in white, but after her arrival, he understood.</p><p></p><p>Chu Xiran sighed, "Yes, to find someone from the Immortal Realms in this lower realm, is simply a foolish fantasy, I didn't expect to actually find them..."</p><p></p><p>Here is the full English translation of the excerpt from the Chinese novel:</p><p></p><p>"..."</p><p></p><p>The ancient crane next to him was already dumbfounded! </p><p></p><p>The topic was too high-end, and he didn't even dare to listen anymore. This was the first time someone had talked to him about the immortal realms one after another... He was still in the Foundation Establishment stage, oh my goodness!</p><p></p><p>In the past, he wouldn't have even dared to think about it.</p><p></p><p>"Master, although the old turtle does not know how this little cultivator arrived at this mortal realm, he can guess the reason why she cannot return," the old turtle chuckled.</p><p></p><p>The old turtle glanced at Chu Xiruo, then looked at Lu Changsheng and smiled foolishly.</p><p></p><p>Lu Changsheng remained silent, picked up the cup of Spring Breeze for Ten Miles, but did not drink the Immortal Cyan Heavenly Nectar...</p><p></p><p>Chu Xiruo's eyes flashed as she said, "It seems that you also know about the blockage of the ascension channel to the immortal realms. I suppose you have also tried, but failed to break through in the end. There are five people guarding that side, so the three of us working together will surely be able to break through the encirclement!"</p><p></p><p>"Pfft!"</p><p></p><p>The old turtle almost spewed all the wine in his mouth onto the already stunned Ancient Crane's face!</p><p></p><p>"Uh, Master, I'm sorry, I just couldn't hold it in," the old turtle looked at Lu Changsheng, trying hard to suppress his laughter, his face flushed.</p><p></p><p>Ancient Crane's mind was in a daze at the moment. Even though some of the wine had splashed onto him, he didn't notice.</p><p></p><p>He had never seen the ascension channel before, nor did he know where it was, but he had heard that it was the only way for cultivators to ascend to the immortal realms after breaking through the tribulation!</p><p></p><p>And it was actually blocked...</p><p></p><p>Then what would happen to the ascension of the Elder Ancestor of the Carefree Immortal Abode in the Western Regions?</p><p></p><p>In the future, how would they ascend if they reached a certain cultivation level?</p><p></p><p>"Fellow Daoist, why are you laughing?" Chu Xiruo frowned slightly, looking at the old turtle with some displeasure.</p><p></p><p>"Ah, nothing, nothing, I wasn't laughing at all. Which eye of yours saw me laughing?" the old turtle sat up straight.</p><p></p><p>"Not to mention for my own sake," Chu Xiruo sighed lightly, feeling indignant. "In the four directions of the immortal realms, no sect or domain is allowed to block the ascension channels of the myriad realms for any reason. This is an immortal law! It was even formulated by the former Immortal Emperor of Longevity himself!"</p><p></p><p>"Their such cruel actions not only cut off the immortal path of others, but also defy the immortal law of the Immortal Emperor of Longevity! If I can return to the immortal realms, I must go and expose them!"</p><p></p><p>The old turtle pursed his lips after hearing this, and glanced at Lu Changsheng for no apparent reason...</p><p></p><p>Lu Changsheng suddenly pushed the wine cup towards the Immortal Cyan Heavenly Nectar, softly saying, "Fill it up."</p><p></p><p>Chu Xiruo was slightly taken aback, but then delighted, standing up to pour the Immortal Cyan Heavenly Nectar into cups for the three of them.</p><p></p><p>She knew that since the other party was willing to drink her Immortal Cyan Heavenly Nectar, they had a chance of working together to break through the ascension channel.</p><p></p><p>Ancient Crane stared blankly at the Immortal Cyan Heavenly Nectar in front of him. After hearing about the situation with the ascension channel, he didn't feel like drinking it anymore.</p><p></p><p>Lu Changsheng picked up the wine cup and took a sip, his expression unchanged.</p><p></p><p>"Crane, why don't you drink?" the old turtle chuckled. "Grandpa Turtle tells you, if you drink a cup of this, you can save at least fifty years of cultivation!"</p><p></p><p>Huh? Fifty years?!</p><p></p><p>Ancient Crane was immediately shocked, instantly discarding his previous dejected thoughts, and eagerly picked up the wine cup, gulping it down in one go!</p><p></p><p>As soon as the wine entered his body, Ancient Crane felt a heat rising in his dantian, and his nascent soul began to tremble, a trembling of yearning!</p><p></p><p>At this time, the old turtle pointed a finger at Ancient Crane's forehead and said without a word, "Close your eyes, Grandpa Turtle will help you refine it."</p><p></p><p>"Thank you, Senior Turtle!" Ancient Crane then looked apologetically at Lu Changsheng and began to refine the wine.</p><p></p><p>Clang.</p><p></p><p>Lu Changsheng placed the wine cup down and looked at Chu Xiruo indifferently, "Since you've had me drink your wine, I'll send you back to the four directions of the immortal realms when the time comes."</p><p></p><p>The old turtle, who was helping Ancient Crane refine the wine, saw this and smiled, knowing that the woman in white had just touched on a sensitive topic for his master.</p><p></p><p>Chu Xiruo heard this, first delighted, then surprised, "Send... send me? Fellow Daoists, are you not returning?"</p>

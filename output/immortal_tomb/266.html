        <h1>Chapter 266</h1>
        <div class="content">
            <p>Here is my translation of the Chinese excerpt:</p><p></p><p>Long Shengcheng nodded and did not refuse. Although the item was useless to him, if he did not accept it, this Divine Emperor Yinyao would likely not sleep soundly afterwards. So he reluctantly accepted it.</p><p></p><p>"Thank you Senior Long!" Seeing this, Yinyao was overjoyed, happy like a child. At the same time, his heart was completely at ease - since Senior Long was willing to accept the gift, it meant that as long as he behaved himself in the future, Senior Long should not come to cause him trouble.</p><p></p><p>Beside them, Xing Tian and the others were speechless. This was the first time they had seen someone send a gift and express gratitude at the same time... and this person was the lofty Divine Emperor.</p><p></p><p>It was truly a rare sight.</p><p></p><p>However, they could also understand it.</p><p></p><p>"Senior Long, Mirror Observation has come to pay the diagnosis fee to redeem the staff," Mirror Observation said respectfully, handing over a ring.</p><p></p><p>Yinyao and the others were slightly taken aback - it seemed Mirror Observation was already acquainted with Senior Long... Ah yes, a year ago when Senior Long clashed with the Heavenly Dao, Mirror Observation had appeared to plead on his behalf, they suddenly realized.</p><p></p><p>"Mm." Long Shengcheng lightly raised his hand, and the ring flew into Childlike Heart's hand. Childlike Heart's spirit immediately entered the ring, and he sharply inhaled. Inside the ring was a mountain of multicolored spirit stones, numbering at least a hundred thousand!</p><p></p><p>Childlike Heart had never seen so many multicolored spirit stones before. He looked at the expressionless Mirror Observation, his eyes revealing his shock - this guy is rich!</p><p></p><p>"Take it." Long Shengcheng's hand produced a staff, which he pushed towards Mirror Observation. Mirror Observation reached out and took the staff, pausing for a moment before respectfully saying, "Senior Long, previously I was trapped in the Ninth Tribulation and could not break free on my own, thank you for your guidance."</p><p></p><p>Long Shengcheng smiled and said, "There's no need to thank me, it's just using money to treat an illness."</p><p></p><p>Hearing this, Mirror Observation hesitated, then sighed lightly and stood up to bow, "Senior Long, Mirror Observation takes his leave."</p><p></p><p>Just as he turned to leave, Long Shengcheng asked, "What did you want to say? Feel free to speak."</p><p></p><p>Mirror Observation paused, then turned around holding the staff and sincerely said, "Mirror Observation wishes to follow Senior Long."</p><p></p><p>Huh?</p><p></p><p>The others were stunned, staring blankly at Mirror Observation. In their hearts, they were cursing this monk for his shamelessness, daring to say such an impudent thing in front of everyone!</p><p></p><p>Long Shengcheng softly said, "No longer a monk?"</p><p></p><p>Mirror Observation replied, "I have passed on the position of Dharma Master to Huihai, and now I am unbound."</p><p></p><p>Long Shengcheng nodded and said, "Then go."</p><p></p><p>Mirror Observation was intelligent, and immediately understood, a slight smile appearing on his face. He bowed respectfully and then turned to leave.</p><p></p><p>Yinyao and the others were not stupid either, and could see that Senior Long had agreed! Yinyao also didn't expect that Mirror Observation had already relinquished the position of Dharma Master.</p><p></p><p>It seemed he had planned this trip in advance.</p><p></p><p>Afterwards, Yinyao didn't know what else to say, so he bowed to take his leave.</p><p></p><p>"Divine Emperor, Xing Tian has some matters to discuss, you may leave first," Xing Tian suddenly said.</p><p></p><p>Yinyao gave him a deep look but didn't say anything more, just nodding and leaving with his guards.</p><p></p><p>Next, before Yuan Yang Qiu could speak, Long Shengcheng directly summoned black mist from the bodies of a few elders behind Yuan Yang Qiu.</p><p></p><p>Yuan Yang Qiu and the others were delighted, paid the diagnosis fee, and expressed their deep gratitude before leaving. They could see that the First Guardian seemed to have something, so they didn't linger.</p><p></p><p>Soon, only Xing Tian and Long Shengcheng were left in the medical pavilion. Long Shengcheng calmly looked at Xing Tian, while the others looked at Xing Tian with puzzlement, and Xing Tian was focused on intently watching the little Tong behind the counter, hesitating to speak.</p><p></p><p>Here is the full English translation of the Chinese excerpt:</p><p></p><p>"God Emperor, will the first guardian not...?"</p><p></p><p>In the void, a guardian hesitated.</p><p></p><p>"No, he will not." </p><p></p><p>Yinyao, the leader, shook his head and sighed helplessly, "Moreover, even if Hentian did that, our God Emperor would not resent him. A good bird chooses the tree to nest in, and he has done enough for our God Emperor's Palace over the years."</p><p></p><p>"Not just Hentian, if it weren't for our God Emperor unwilling to give up this position of God Emperor, our God Emperor would also want to follow Senior Lu, that great expert. And our God Emperor has a premonition... even if we asked, Senior Lu would not accept our God Emperor."</p><p></p><p>The guardians fell silent.</p><p></p><p>Yes, even someone like Jinguan the Buddhist Master...</p><p></p><p>At the same time, on the other side, Yuan Yangqiu and his group.</p><p></p><p>"Sect Master, why did you not express the wish to follow Buddhist Master Jinguan? If you could follow Senior Lu, the future would be... boundless." An elder asked regretfully.</p><p></p><p>Yuan Yangqiu paused, then sighed and said softly, "Elders, do not think too much. What kind of person is Buddhist Master Jinguan, and what kind of people are we... </p><p></p><p>People must have self-awareness."</p><p></p><p>The elders fell silent.</p><p></p><p>...</p><p></p><p>In the boundless void, an indifferent dialogue sounded.</p><p></p><p>"Recently, the Tao of a middle world was extinguished."</p><p></p><p>"Hmm? Who did it? The Eight Ancient Clans?"</p><p></p><p>"I don't know, that world whose Tao was extinguished is very far from here, and we are still investigating."</p><p></p><p>"Why investigate? Within the known scope, other than the Eight Ancient Clans, who else would dare to go against our Tao."</p><p></p><p>"I have a premonition that it was not someone from the Eight Ancient Clans, after all, that world is too far away, how could the people of the Eight Ancient Clans appear there...?"</p><p></p><p>"You almost forgot about this. Speaking of which, do you know if they succeeded back then?"</p><p></p><p>"No, they came back covered in dirt and grime, it seems they only barely managed to suppress it."</p><p></p><p>"I do want to see this extraordinary person who possesses the Eternal Life Body... Hehe, the Eight Ancient Clans were careless, how could someone with the Eternal Life Body be easily dealt with?"</p><p></p><p>"Don't worry, after a hundred thousand years, the Eight Ancient Clans will definitely take action again, they will never be reconciled to just giving up the Eternal Life Body... After all, it represents eternal life!"</p><p></p><p>"Where is that person now, suppressed?"</p><p></p><p>"I don't know."</p><p></p><p>"With so many eyes in our Tao, how can we not know?"</p><p></p><p>"Heh, just some small fry in the Tao, they can't stir up any waves, at most they can only intimidate a few words and not dare to even take a breath, but the Eight Ancient Clans will definitely give them some face out of consideration for us, but that's all."</p><p></p><p>"Let's leave it at that for now, how long has it been since a Tao was killed... This time the extinguished one is a middle world's Tao... The culprit must be found!"</p><p></p><p>"Mm, as soon as there is news, I will dispatch the Tao to hunt them down! Even if the culprit is the Eight Ancient Clans, they must pay the price!"</p><p></p><p>...</p><p></p><p>In the Longevity Medical Pavilion, </p><p></p><p>the atmosphere was strange.</p><p></p><p>Xiaotong was frightened by Hentian's direct gaze, and she ran to stand beside Lu Changsheng, seeking protection.</p><p></p><p>"Hentian, your gaze is scaring the young lady."</p><p></p><p>Lu Changsheng looked at Hentian, with a half-smile.</p><p></p><p>Hentian was startled, his face flushing slightly. He felt awkward, not knowing where to put his hands. He looked at Xiaotong and comforted her, </p><p></p><p>"Little miss, don't be afraid, uncle is not a bad person."</p><p></p><p>"Uncle just feels a strange familiarity with you."</p>

        <h1>Chapter 99</h1>
        <div class="content">
            <p>Here is the full English translation of the Chinese excerpt:</p><p></p><p>Seeing Chu Lang's manner, many people's pupils shrank, and they began to observe the expressions of Huang Zhong and Chen He.</p><p></p><p>It seems that the three major immortal clans must have already made some preparations...</p><p></p><p>"Audacious!" Zhao Ling's gaze was sharp, "You little immortal clan, are you going to defy the Inspection Palace?"</p><p></p><p>Recalling the mighty Inspection Palace, Chu Lang's heart trembled a bit, and he said calmly, "The Inspection Master has misunderstood. We small immortal clans naturally dare not defy the Inspection Master, nor dare we defy the Inspection Palace. It's just that unfounded accusations have been imposed on us. Who will wash away our grievances? I hope the Inspection Masters will reconsider..."</p><p></p><p>"Reconsider? Is this a threat?" Zhao Ling sneered disdainfully.</p><p></p><p>Chu Lang took a step back, standing side by side with Huang Zhong and Chen He, lowering his brows and remaining silent.</p><p></p><p>A gust of wind blew through, unusually clear in the deathly silent square.</p><p></p><p>Everyone stood like statues.</p><p></p><p>"Hmph." Zhao Ling swept her eyes over Chu Lang and the others, then raised her head and spoke coldly, like words of gold and jade, "The Chu, Huang, and Chen immortal clans are under serious suspicion, and have defied the Inspection Palace. Today, we Inspection Masters will take Chu Lang, Huang Zhong, and Chen He back to the Inspection Palace for a second trial!"</p><p></p><p>As the words fell, Chu Lang, Huang Zhong, and Chen He suddenly raised their heads, their eyes shining with determination!</p><p></p><p>The surrounding vast crowd also nervously rubbed their fingers.</p><p></p><p>Take them back to the Inspection Palace for a second trial? It sounds nice, but everyone knows that these three clan leaders are likely to be killed along the way...</p><p></p><p>"We don't agree! You have no evidence, and with so many people watching, on what grounds can you take us away!" Chu Lang shouted angrily, his face flushed.</p><p></p><p>Zhao Ling's mouth curled into a mocking smile. "Naive, the Inspection Palace doesn't need your consent to act. Seize them!"</p><p></p><p>"Yes!" Immediately, the four Inspection Masters behind her bowed in response, and then slowly approached Chu Lang, Huang Zhong, and Chen He, exuding a strong sense of oppression.</p><p></p><p>Seeing this, Chu Lang calmed down and glanced at Huang Zhong and Chen He, the three of them nodding in tacit understanding.</p><p></p><p>"To capture us, you five Inspection Masters are not enough!" As the words fell, in the center of the square, the hundreds of figures of the three major immortal clans suddenly erupted with a vast immortal aura! Various powerful pressures swept across the area, with the weakest being Earth Immortals. And Chu Lang, Huang Zhong, and Chen He, the three clan leaders, were even Fourth-Grade Golden Immortals!</p><p></p><p>Instantly, the entire square became turbulent, and under such circumstances, the crowd could no longer remain silent.</p><p></p><p>"You think I don't know you want to resist? Puny immortal clans, how laughable!" Zhao Ling sneered coldly, and her aura suddenly exploded, sweeping across the entire area!</p><p></p><p>Everyone was frozen in place.</p><p></p><p>This... This was at least a Seventh-Grade Golden Immortal!</p><p></p><p>Indeed, in this remote Langian Domain, the Inspection Masters must have some strength, or they wouldn't dare to rashly condemn these three immortal clan leaders.</p><p></p><p>Even though she was only a bronze-level Inspection Master in the Inspection Palace.</p><p></p><p>"Eighth-Grade Golden Immortal...!" Chu Lang, Huang Zhong, and Chen He were shocked to the core of their souls.</p><p></p><p>Eighth-Grade Golden Immortal... Wasn't the Patriarch of the Heavenly Eternal Sect also an Eighth-Grade Golden Immortal back then?</p><p></p><p>There's no way they can win against this. If it were Fifth or Sixth-Grade, they might have a chance with their numerical advantage. But Eighth-Grade, it's like an insurmountable chasm. They had just entered the middle stage of Golden Immortality, while she had long since reached the late stage.</p><p></p><p>At this time, the other four Inspection Masters also erupted with immortal aura! Three Second-Grade Golden Immortals and one Third-Grade Golden Immortal!</p><p></p><p>Chu Lang and the others were utterly hopeless.</p><p></p><p>"Resist? Compete with my Inspection Palace? Do you have what it takes?"</p><p></p><p>Here is the full English translation of the Chinese excerpt:</p><p></p><p>"What power do you have?" Zhao Ling sneered coldly. She really enjoyed bullying people in this small place!</p><p></p><p>Because here, as an Eighth-Grade Golden Immortal, she was the supreme deity!</p><p></p><p>She could control the fate of anyone!</p><p></p><p>"I advise you, don't bother resisting. As long as you three obediently come with us to the Patrol Hall, I won't harm your clan members," Zhao Ling said indifferently.</p><p></p><p>There are too many people here for now, after taking these three clan leaders away, I'll just send two people back to annihilate the three clans.</p><p></p><p>The three of Chu Lang put away their powerful auras and became dejected. From the moment they knew Zhao Ling was an Eighth-Grade Golden Immortal, they had lost the will to resist.</p><p></p><p>Even if they resisted, it would be futile.</p><p></p><p>And Zhao Ling's words made them even more unwilling to resist.</p><p></p><p>After all, they were clan leaders, they had to consider their clan. Even if they knew Zhao Ling's words were likely lies, they had no choice.</p><p></p><p>"Clan leader..."</p><p></p><p>The elders in the back saw their clan leaders' diminished auras and felt saddened in their hearts.</p><p></p><p>They knew the thoughts of Chu Lang's three.</p><p></p><p>Chu Xiruo looked at Chu Lang's dejected back, and for some reason, she became anxious.</p><p></p><p>The resentment she had held towards him in the past dissipated in this moment.</p><p></p><p>"Seize them."</p><p></p><p>Seeing the three had lost the will to resist, Zhao Ling waved her hand coldly.</p><p></p><p>Four patrol envoys received the order and slowly approached Chu Lang's three, with some vigilance, not daring to be careless.</p><p></p><p>They were only Second-Grade Golden Immortals and a Third-Grade Golden Immortal.</p><p></p><p>If these three clan leaders suddenly rebelled, they would have a hard time.</p><p></p><p>Watching the patrol envoys approach Chu Lang's three, Chu Xiruo's expression changed repeatedly, but she was powerless to do anything!</p><p></p><p>That feeling made her extremely distressed!</p><p></p><p>The group of elders also had gloomy expressions, as if they were about to lose control and act, but thinking that acting would betray the will of their clan leader, they could only helplessly restrain themselves!</p><p></p><p>The few steps the patrol envoys took towards them seemed exceptionally long at this moment...</p><p></p><p>The crowd on the square were all tense, their eyes fixed on Chu Lang's three, wanting to see if the silent three clan leaders would suddenly rebel.</p><p></p><p>Soon, the four patrol envoys reached in front of Chu Lang and the others, and they took out three bundles of chains of unknown material.</p><p></p><p>Casting a simple spell, the chains shot out and firmly bound Chu Lang's three!</p><p></p><p>The complex talismans on the chains flashed with silver light, then subsided.</p><p></p><p>Seeing this, the four patrol envoys finally let out a sigh of relief, good, they didn't resist.</p><p></p><p>The crowd inside and outside the square were also disappointed, is that it? Many of them had come from afar hoping to see the three major immortal clans rise up and peel off a layer of these despicable patrol envoys, but alas.</p><p></p><p>The patrol envoys tugged at the chains, making a clanking sound.</p><p></p><p>"Let's go."</p><p></p><p>Chu Lang's three walked like prisoners, heads lowered, their hearts extremely unwilling. But...</p><p></p><p>"Father! Father!" </p><p></p><p>At this moment, Chu Xiruo could no longer hold back, calling out with red eyes.</p><p></p><p>Chu Lang's footsteps paused for a moment, and he looked up at her with a relieved smile.</p><p></p><p>After ten-plus years, he finally got her to call him that, today was a good thing after all.</p><p></p><p>"Stop dawdling, let's go," Zhao Ling said indifferently.</p><p></p><p>Tap, tap, tap...</p><p></p><p>At this moment, unhurried footsteps sounded!</p><p></p><p>Everyone's gaze changed, instinctively following the sound, and they saw a young man in blue robes, escorted by a hunchbacked old man, walking slowly towards the center.</p><p></p><p>What is he going to do?</p><p></p><p>Lu Changsheng walked leisurely with his hands behind his back, his tone slightly melancholic.</p><p></p><p>"Your Patrol Hall... has quite the audacity!"</p>

        <div class="content">
            <p>Here is the full English translation of the Chinese excerpt:</p><p></p><p>Outside the town, by the lake.</p><p></p><p>"Ah, what's going on exactly?" </p><p></p><p>Old Xu put away his fishing rod, dejected and sighing.</p><p></p><p>He had come here before dawn, and had been fishing for one or two hours, but had only caught a small fish...</p><p></p><p>It shouldn't be like this, his performance last night was so brilliant and unparalleled!</p><p></p><p>Mr. Lu had also praised him as a fishing genius.</p><p></p><p>"Well, maybe there are more fish at night, and they're still sleeping in the morning!"</p><p></p><p>Old Xu comforted himself, and felt much better. It did make sense after all!</p><p></p><p>After all, he was still a novice.</p><p></p><p>Ah, he should have asked Mr. Lu about the fish's habits beforehand.</p><p></p><p>Afterwards, Old Xu put away his gear, picked up the small fish, and hurried back to Auspicious Town.</p><p></p><p>...</p><p></p><p>Old Xu's noodle shop.</p><p></p><p>It was already past breakfast time, and most of the customers had left, with only two people still waiting impatiently.</p><p></p><p>Judging by their expressions, they were about to lose their patience.</p><p></p><p>Just then, Old Xu finally came running back, panting.</p><p></p><p>The two immediately started scolding him:</p><p></p><p>"Old Xu, where have you been? Do you know how long we've been waiting?"</p><p></p><p>"That's right! A lot of people have already left! If you're not going to do business, can you just put up a sign?"</p><p></p><p>Old Xu coughed and apologized repeatedly, then turned around to open the shop.</p><p></p><p>That's when the two saw the fishing gear on his back, and the small fish he was holding...</p><p></p><p>They immediately realized where Old Xu had been!</p><p></p><p>Well, he had actually gone fishing!</p><p></p><p>The two exchanged a glance and joked:</p><p></p><p>"I say, Old Xu, do you think you're Mr. Lu? Fishing as well?"</p><p></p><p>"Yeah, after all this time, you couldn't have just caught this tiny little fish, right? Is this enough to fill a tooth gap? I bet if you cook it for the noodles, it'll just melt and you won't be able to find a single piece of fish meat."</p><p></p><p>Old Xu's face flushed red, feeling embarrassed. He retorted, "What do you know? The fish are all sleeping in the morning, it's not easy to catch them, understand?"</p><p></p><p>"Besides, last night I, Old Xu, caught a lot of big fish, and they're now kept in the tank at the noodle shop. I'll show you two later and open your eyes!"</p><p></p><p>The two exchanged a glance, obviously not believing him, then sighed, "Forget it, we don't need to see them. By the time you cook the noodles, it'll be too late, and we still have things to do. We're leaving."</p><p></p><p>As they were about to leave, Old Xu suddenly appeared in front of them like the wind, blocking their way with his arm and gritting his teeth:</p><p></p><p>"You may not eat the noodles, but you have to see the big fish I caught last night!!"</p><p></p><p>The two were taken aback, not understanding Old Xu's strange behavior. They felt like he had gone a little crazy - the kind old man they knew had turned into a stubborn child.</p><p></p><p>Before they could say anything, Old Xu continued, "You two have to see them, or I won't let you leave today!"</p><p></p><p>"Alright, alright, we'll look, Old Xu, we can't argue with you."</p><p></p><p>The two had no choice but to reluctantly agree and follow Old Xu into the noodle shop.</p><p></p><p>"Whoa, so many big fish? Old Xu, you're serious?"</p><p>"Goodness, if you sell them, you could make quite a bit of money!"</p><p></p><p>In the noodle shop, the two were amazed at the large fish swimming in the tank.</p><p></p><p>Seeing their shocked expressions, Old Xu felt a sense of achievement he had never experienced before, and felt very satisfied.</p><p></p><p>His previous embarrassment had completely disappeared, and Old Xu puffed out his chest proudly, "Of course it's true! If you don't believe me, you can go ask Mr. Lu! Mr. Lu only taught me once, and I've been catching fish one after another!"</p><p></p><p>"Old Xu, you're amazing!"</p><p></p><p>The two praised him.</p><p></p><p>Afterwards, the satisfied Old Xu sent the two on their way, knowing they wouldn't be eating the noodles.</p><p></p><p>...</p><p></p><p>"Do you think becoming a book cultivator is easy?" </p><p></p><p>In the Longevity Academy classroom, Lu Changsheng sat at the podium and asked.</p><p></p><p>Sitting in the classroom were Han Yue, Ye Xiaoxiao, and Xiao Fan.</p><p></p><p>The original fifteen students had dwindled down to only three.</p><p></p><p>Han Yue and Ye Xiaoxiao...</p><p></p><p>Here is the full English translation of the Chinese excerpt:</p><p></p><p>Xiao Wen heard this and his eyes lit up, as the teacher had brought up the topic of becoming a book refiner again!</p><p></p><p>As for Xiao Fan, his expression remained unchanged, as if there were no great waves in his heart.</p><p></p><p>Xiao Fan raised his hand, and after seeing that Lu Changsheng nodded in approval, he stood up respectfully and said:</p><p></p><p>"In response to the teacher, becoming a book refiner is very difficult. The student has heard that to become a book refiner, one needs to be well-versed in poetry and books, have a sudden enlightenment, and most importantly, needs to be blessed by the saints of heaven and earth, only then can one truly be considered a book refiner."</p><p></p><p>Lu Changsheng looked at him indifferently: "Do you think I don't know that?"</p><p></p><p>Xiao Fan's expression changed slightly, and he smiled awkwardly, lowering his head.</p><p></p><p>Han Yue and Ye Xiaoxiao sat upright, their eyes straight ahead.</p><p></p><p>"Xiao Fan, I suddenly want to ask you, since you think becoming a book refiner is so difficult, why don't you go to the Tianwu Sect? You have the martial arts bloodline, could it be that you also have a heart for the Dao of books?" Lu Changsheng said softly.</p><p></p><p>"No." Xiao Fan hurriedly bowed and said, "Teacher, the student has no grand ambitions, I just simply want to continue studying under the teacher's tutelage."</p><p></p><p>"Whether it's the Dao of books or the martial arts, it doesn't matter if I can succeed or not, I just hope that one day I can become a teacher like you, and I will have no regrets."</p><p></p><p>Xiao Fan's face was filled with admiration.</p><p></p><p>Ah, the martial arts, the Dao of books, it doesn't matter, he truly envies the teacher's way of life!</p><p></p><p>How wonderful it is!</p><p></p><p>Xiao Fan had long since decided that the teacher's carefree and worry-free life is exactly what he dreams of.</p><p></p><p>Becoming a martial arts cultivator or a book refiner, there's bound to be fighting and killing, that's too dangerous...</p><p></p><p>Oh?</p><p></p><p>Lu Changsheng raised his eyebrows slightly.</p><p></p><p>This Xiao Fan is quite interesting, at such a young age, his thoughts are actually so mediocre?</p><p></p><p>"Xiao Fan, your idea is not bad, but do you know the prerequisite?" Lu Changsheng asked.</p><p></p><p>Xiao Fan shook his head blankly, not understanding.</p><p></p><p>"What you long for and desire requires a strong foundation of power." Lu Changsheng said calmly.</p><p></p><p>Xiao Fan was startled, his idea of being a mediocre person had actually been seen through by the teacher...</p><p></p><p>"To want to live a comfortable and stable life, it may sound easy but is not easy, do you know why?" Lu Changsheng chuckled.</p><p></p><p>"The student does not know, please enlighten me, teacher!" Xiao Fan bowed sincerely.</p><p></p><p>On the side, Han Yue and Ye Xiaoxiao were dumbfounded, their heads a little dizzy.</p><p></p><p>They still couldn't understand how the topic had suddenly shifted from the difficulty of becoming a book refiner to the comfort of life...</p><p></p><p>Even more absurd is that Xiao Fan is actually seriously asking the teacher for an explanation?</p><p></p><p>What is Xiao Fan's intention?</p><p></p><p>At such a young age, he's not studying diligently, but is instead directly thinking of just lying down and doing nothing?</p><p></p><p>"To want to live a truly comfortable life... it's easy, but to want to live a truly comfortable life in the true sense... it's difficult. Let me simply ask you, do people not have birth, aging, sickness and death? Do they not have sudden disasters and fortunes?" Lu Changsheng asked.</p><p></p><p>"Yes..." Xiao Fan's expression was grim, he understood the teacher's meaning now.</p><p></p><p>"It seems you understand now, so what I said earlier, that to truly live a comfortable life requires a strong foundation of power, is that right or not?" Lu Changsheng smiled faintly.</p><p></p><p>"The teacher's words are absolutely right!" Xiao Fan suddenly enlightened.</p><p></p><p>Ah, what he has been dreaming of, is a truly carefree and worry-free life. Of course he wants to enjoy it for a longer time, during which he must struggle against birth, aging, sickness and death, and also be able to block or even eliminate disasters. </p><p></p><p>And all of this requires power!</p><p></p><p>On the side, Han Yue and Ye Xiaoxiao were listening in a daze, they did not think like Xiao Fan, wanting to just lie down and do nothing, so they couldn't understand it for the moment.</p><p></p><p>At this time, Xiao Fan seemed to have thought of something, suddenly looked up and tentatively asked, "Teacher, can your life be considered truly comfortable?"</p><p></p><p>Lu Changsheng smiled faintly, "Of course!"</p><p></p><p>Xiao Fan's expression changed, his eyes burning with intensity!</p>

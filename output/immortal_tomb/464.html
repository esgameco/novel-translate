        <h1>Chapter 464</h1>
        <div class="content">
            <p>Here is the full English translation of the Chinese excerpt:</p><p></p><p>The Heavenly Astral Tower of the He Clan.</p><p></p><p>He Lian and the venerable ancestor of the He Clan, He Yan Ci, brought the expressionless He Xi Tong to the top of the Heavenly Astral Tower.</p><p></p><p>"Star Master, the Millennium Calamity Body has been brought here," He Lian said to the man in the black robe.</p><p></p><p>However, He Yan Ci stared intently at the man in the black robe, his eyes flickering. As the clan leader, He Lian had of course already had an in-depth discussion with this mysterious black-robed man.</p><p></p><p>Through what He Lian had told him, He Yan Ci naturally also knew of the unfathomable mystery surrounding this black-robed man, and at the same time his heart was filled with vigilance and dread towards this black-robed man who had inexplicably shown them warmth.</p><p></p><p>The black-robed man looked at He Xi Tong, but his expression could not be seen under the black robe. He quickly averted his gaze and said, "Venerable Ancestor of the He Clan, time waits for no one. Quickly enter the Extreme Refinement Formation with the Millennium Calamity Body."</p><p></p><p>He Yan Ci glanced at He Xi Tong beside him, then nodded slightly, and then went into the Extreme Refinement Formation, sitting down in a cross-legged position.</p><p></p><p>Afterwards, He Xi Tong also calmly entered the Extreme Refinement Formation, sitting down on the ground, and suddenly said, "Don't forget the heavenly oath you made."</p><p></p><p>He Lian's heart stirred, and she replied calmly, "Don't worry, as the clan leader, I naturally won't break a heavenly oath."</p><p></p><p>He Xi Tong was then relieved, and closed his eyes in resignation.</p><p></p><p>"Are you ready? I'm going to activate the Extreme Refinement Formation!" the black-robed man urged.</p><p></p><p>He Yan Ci's eyes narrowed, and he transmitted a message to He Lian with an unchanged expression, "Alian, keep a close eye on the black-robed man's movements. If anything is amiss, stop him immediately!"</p><p></p><p>"Ancestor, don't worry," He Lian responded, but in her heart, she felt bitter. The black-robed man was so mysterious, if he truly had malicious intentions, could she really stop him?</p><p></p><p>"It seems you're ready." The black-robed man slightly opened his hands, and the complex patterns on the ground suddenly flashed with dazzling multicolored light!</p><p></p><p>The black-robed man continued, "Clan Leader, you don't need to stay here. Go down and prepare to command your He Clan disciples to activate the Sky-Shielding Formation."</p><p></p><p>He Lian's gaze changed slightly. She couldn't leave the Heavenly Astral Tower, so she said, "Star Master, don't worry, the activation of the Sky-Shielding Formation has already been arranged for the clan elders."</p><p></p><p>The black-robed man looked at He Lian and said mockingly, "Clan Leader, it seems you don't really trust me..."</p><p></p><p>He Lian forced a smile and said, "Star Master, how could the clan leader not trust you?"</p><p></p><p>"Hehe, it's fine if you want to stay in the Heavenly Astral Tower, but are you sure the Ouyang and other ancient clans can hold them off?" the black-robed man said with a hint of a smile.</p><p></p><p>He Lian fell silent for a moment, then said, "The refinement of the Millennium Calamity Body will be completed in no more than three days. Just three days, the clan leader believes in Ancestor Ouyang and the others."</p><p></p><p>At this moment, the black-robed man seemed to have forgotten about the existence of Lu Changsheng, and said with a mysterious smile, "Then do as you wish... But Clan Leader, remember to inform your clan elders that the Sky-Shielding Formation should not be activated now, but at the most critical moment of refining the Millennium Calamity Body..."</p><p></p><p>"Okay, the clan leader will wait for the Star Master's command."</p><p></p><p>...</p><p></p><p>At the same time, outside the He Clan, the Ouyang Clan and the other sixty-plus top ancient clans, including the Zhou Clan, were suspended high in the sky, on full alert!</p><p></p><p>The Hung Clan and other ancient clans, if they wanted to obstruct the refinement, the first thing they should do was to break through this barrier!</p><p></p><p>Clearly, it would be extremely difficult!</p><p></p><p>Suddenly, a gust of air came from the distance, blowing the hair and robes of the crowd, and even the heavens and earth began to tremble.</p><p></p><p>The Ouyang and other ancient clan members noticed this, their pupils constricting, and they looked towards that distant horizon, only to see a vast black mass obscuring the sky, rushing towards them!</p><p></p><p>"Ancestor Ouyang, it's the Hung Clan!"</p><p></p><p>"With such a large number, it seems they've gathered quite a few middle-ranked ancient clans."</p><p></p><p>Here is the full English translation of the Chinese excerpt:</p><p></p><p>"Ah......"</p><p></p><p>"Haha, what are you panicking about? We have sixty top-tier ancient clans on our side, while they only have forty. The twenty-clan gap is not something that a few medium-tier ancient clans can fill."</p><p></p><p>"......"</p><p></p><p>Listening to the discussions of the crowd, Ouyang Mao, the patriarch of the Ouyang clan, suddenly opened his eyes, coldly looking at the approaching massive army and shouting loudly:</p><p></p><p>"Hong Wanjun, you should stop here!"</p><p></p><p>"Ouyang Mao, I just want to know one thing - what benefits did your clan offer you that made the mighty Ouyang Patriarch become the running dog of the He clan?!"</p><p></p><p>Soon, the patriarch of the Hong clan, Hong Wanjun, retorted with cold sarcasm.</p><p></p><p>Ouyang Mao's eyes flashed with a chill!</p><p></p><p>The next moment, the ancient clan forces of the Hong clan had already arrived at the opposite side, thousands of feet away, and due to their large numbers, the space here seemed to be distorted and compressed!</p><p></p><p>A thousand feet distance, for these cultivators of high attainments, is practically nothing, and a great battle was about to erupt!</p><p></p><p>In the Ye clan's team, Lu Changsheng stroked his chin and glanced at the He clan. He immediately noticed that the He clan had a grand formation ready to be unleashed...</p><p></p><p>This formation was quite interesting. With just a glance, Lu Changsheng could see the purpose of this grand formation.</p><p></p><p>At this time, the Ye clan members, such as Ye Zhuiyue, Ye Zhuixing, and Ye Nantian, were looking at the opposing side with grave expressions. Although they did not show any fear, they did not have much hope either.</p><p></p><p>It was true that their side had a large number of people due to the medium-tier ancient clans joining them, but in comparison to the other side, the quality was clearly lacking.</p><p></p><p>The strength gap was still very obvious, and the most important thing was that the He clan had not even appeared in the enemy's lineup yet...</p><p></p><p>"Hong Wanjun, you don't need to say those useless words. As the Ouyang Patriarch, I naturally have my own plans and considerations in standing on the He clan's side."</p><p></p><p>Ouyang Mao said coldly. Among all these people, only the equally powerful Hong Wanjun posed a threat to him.</p><p></p><p>Hong Wanjun wanted to say something more, but suddenly, Hong Wuji standing beside him stepped forward and said, "Patriarch, there's no need to talk to him further! Time waits for no one, and we don't even know the situation within the He clan. Let's just start the battle directly!"</p><p></p><p>Hong Wanjun glanced at Hong Wuji and then nodded slightly. He slowly raised his hand and then swung it down forcefully:</p><p></p><p>"Attack! Break through them. If they succeed, it will affect the descendants of all of us!"</p><p></p><p>Boom!!!</p><p></p><p>The world on the He clan's side suddenly erupted, filled with the powerful spiritual elements and profound energies.</p><p></p><p>The great battle between the two sides was instantly ignited!!</p><p></p><p>"Disciples of the Lin clan, follow this old patriarch to attack!"</p><p></p><p>"Disciples of the Zhao clan..."</p><p></p><p>Roars of battle cries echoed, and countless figures clashed fiercely, like meteors falling to the ground, shaking the heavens with their movements!</p><p></p><p>Under the various spells and powerful battle aftershocks, in just a moment, the land was dyed red with blood!</p><p></p><p>Ye Zhuiyue's face flushed red, and he was about to raise his hand and shout, "Disciples of the Ye clan, follow this old patriarch..."</p><p></p><p>But before he could finish, he was stopped by Lu Changsheng's outstretched arm: "Don't rush."</p><p></p><p>"?" Ye Zhuiyue turned his head, puzzled, looking at Lu Changsheng.</p><p></p><p>Ye Zhuixing, Ye Nantian, and the other Ye clan members had their auras surging, ready to join the battle. But they were surprised to see their patriarch suddenly stop in the middle of his command, engaging in a conversation with Elder Lu.</p><p></p><p>What? In this situation, the patriarch and Elder Lu are still chatting?</p>

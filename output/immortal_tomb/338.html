        <h1>Chapter 338</h1>
        <div class="content">
            <p>Here is the full English translation of the Chinese excerpt:</p><p></p><p>Moxiang arrived at the Xiaoyao Sect. üå∑üêô‚ùª‚ùæÔ∫≥ƒ¶·µò‚ìß.‚ÑÉ‚ìûùê¶‚ô™‚ôü</p><p></p><p>When Peng Fang and the others learned that he was the Lord of the Chiyang Palace, they were immediately on guard. However, after seeing that he had no other intentions, they all heaved a sigh of relief.</p><p></p><p>They then remembered that the Sect Master had said to go to the Chiyang Palace, so it seems that the Sect Master had already settled the matter. Otherwise, this Lord of the Chiyang Palace would definitely have caused trouble.</p><p></p><p>However... Peng Fang and the others still had some doubts, because in their impression, the Sect Master usually wiped out entire sects...</p><p></p><p>This time, he actually spared the Chiyang Palace?</p><p></p><p>As for Moxiang, after seeing the disciples cultivating on the Xiaoyao Sect's training ground, he finally understood why his Elder wanted to seize the Xiaoyao Sect's cultivation techniques.</p><p></p><p>But his Elder had ultimately been careless. How could a sect with such cultivation techniques be ordinary?</p><p></p><p>Afterwards, Moxiang casually mentioned that he wanted to meet Lu Changsheng.</p><p></p><p>Peng Fang just smiled and said that the Sect Master was resting and had instructed no one to be received.</p><p></p><p>In fact, how could Lu Changsheng possibly be in the Xiaoyao Sect? Peng Fang's words were just a way to intimidate.</p><p></p><p>After all, if this Lord of the Chiyang Palace were to get serious, without Lu Changsheng here, they probably wouldn't be able to stop him.</p><p></p><p>Moxiang pursed his lips, cupped his hands, and decisively left.</p><p></p><p>It seems that the Xiaoyao Sect Master had already anticipated his arrival, so he had specially instructed that no one be received.</p><p></p><p>In this way, the Xiaoyao Sect Master became even more unfathomable in Moxiang's heart.</p><p></p><p>.........</p><p></p><p>"Zixuan Yong is looking for you two?"</p><p></p><p>In the majestic central building of Tiancheng, Jian Wuhui, dressed in a simple Confucian robe, sat down and frowned slightly at the two people drinking tea in front of him.</p><p></p><p>The two people were Ban Tian and Jiang Wuxin, who had previously discussed the matter but still decided to come to Tiancheng to consult Jian Wuhui.</p><p></p><p>Jiang Wuxin put down the teacup and said in a serious tone, "Yes, Zixuan Yong said it's related to those alien races that are targeting our human race, but he didn't explain in detail."</p><p></p><p>Ban Tian nodded, his expression conflicted.</p><p></p><p>They were also worried that it might be a trap, so they didn't dare to go rashly.</p><p></p><p>Moreover, he and Jiang Wuxin had discussed it before, and they hadn't had any dealings with the Void Beast Clan recently. Zixuan Yong's sudden approach to them was indeed very strange.</p><p></p><p>This was the reason they came to find Jian Wuhui. If it weren't for this, they would have simply rejected Zixuan Yong. But since it involves their human race, they couldn't afford to be careless, even the slightest bit.</p><p></p><p>Huh?</p><p></p><p>Thinking about this, Ban Tian's eyes suddenly sharpened!</p><p></p><p>A certain person suddenly appeared in his mind!</p><p></p><p>Lu Changsheng!</p><p></p><p>Could it be...?</p><p></p><p>"Hmm? What's wrong, King Ban?" </p><p></p><p>Jian Wuhui, who was about to speak, noticed Ban Tian's unusual behavior and asked.</p><p></p><p>Jiang Wuxin also looked at Ban Tian.</p><p></p><p>"Wind Immortal, I may have figured out Zixuan Yong's intention... The so-called matter related to the alien races targeting our human race is just a pretext!" Ban Tian said in a deep voice.</p><p></p><p>Oh?</p><p></p><p>Jiang Wuxin was taken aback.</p><p></p><p>Jian Wuhui didn't say anything further, just quietly listening.</p><p></p><p>"Wind Immortal, do you still remember the Eternal Realm? Zixuan Yong is probably just doing this because of the matter with Little Friend Lu!" Ban Tian sneered.</p><p></p><p>Eternal Realm? Little Friend Lu?</p><p></p><p>Jian Wuhui's brow raised slightly, his eyes flashing. He immediately thought of Lu Changsheng!</p><p></p><p>That young friend with exceptional talent.</p><p></p><p>At this moment, Jian Wuhui already had a guess in his heart.</p><p></p><p>Since Lu Changsheng was able to have contact with Zixuan Yong, there could only be one way, and that is that he also has some conflict with the Void Beast Clan of the Eternal Realm.</p><p></p><p>Here is the full English translation of the Chinese excerpt:</p><p></p><p>The beast tribe could not withstand it, so they summoned their ancestor.</p><p></p><p>On the new 69 book bar ‚Üí 69shux.com</p><p></p><p>Since this matter is known to both Mangtian and Jiang Wuxin, it means they should also be summoned by their respective descendants.</p><p></p><p>This is most likely how the situation unfolded, but Jian Wuhui still had some unclear points.</p><p></p><p>What grudge or enmity was there between Zixuan Yong and Lu Changsheng? How could it be because of the mere remnants of the Yongzhou Great Realm...</p><p></p><p>Jian Wuhui did not rush to speak, but chose to continue listening quietly.</p><p></p><p>"Little friend Lu?" Jiang Wuxin was taken aback, but his expression soon turned grave, as he had also thought of it.</p><p></p><p>The Eternal Lifeform!</p><p></p><p>Indeed, even the slightest possibility, Zixuan Yong and the others would not give up!</p><p></p><p>Looking at it this way, Zixuan Yong's invitation of him and Mangtian this time, the true intention was to want to eliminate the two of them...</p><p></p><p>After all, in the Divine-Demonic Battlefield, apart from Zixuan Yong, Guyueyu, the Blazing Wolf King, the Heavenly Demon King, and the Nine-Winged King, only the two of them knew about it.</p><p></p><p>Thinking of this, a cold smile appeared on Jiang Wuxin's face.</p><p></p><p>Since they know Zixuan Yong's intention, why bother going?</p><p></p><p>Immediately, Jiang Wuxin stood up and bowed slightly to Jian Wuhui: "Lord Jian, Zixuan Yong's intention, I and the Mang King have more or less grasped it."</p><p></p><p>Mangtian's eyes flashed, and he also stood up, making a salute, ready to take his leave and return to the Earthly City.</p><p></p><p>In the depths of Jian Wuhui's eyes, there was a look of surprise, and he smiled faintly: "Are the two of you leaving?"</p><p></p><p>"Hehe, yes, Lord Jian has fought with the Heavenly Bear Tribe's Heavenly Bear, you must be tired, so we won't disturb your rest," Jiang Wuxin said with a smile.</p><p></p><p>After saying that, the two of them made a salute and turned to leave the hall.</p><p></p><p>Jian Wuhui quietly watched their backs, and suddenly said faintly:</p><p></p><p>"Mang King, Wind Sage, who is that little friend Lu? I also want to get to know him."</p><p></p><p>Mangtian and Jiang Wuxin's figures paused, and they slowly turned around, their faces filled with helplessness.</p><p></p><p>They really didn't want to tell Jian Wuhui about Lu Changsheng's existence.</p><p></p><p>It was related to the Eternal Lifeform, and the fewer people who knew, the better.</p><p></p><p>Even if it was Jian Wuhui, they couldn't guarantee that he could resist the temptation of the Eternal Lifeform.</p><p></p><p>Moreover, whether that little friend Lu had the Eternal Lifeform or not was still an unsolved mystery.</p><p></p><p>"Lord Jian, the Lu little friend we mentioned is just a genius from the distant Yongzhou Great Realm, there's nothing special about it, right?" Mangtian said awkwardly.</p><p></p><p>He now hated himself, he should have just sent a voice transmission to Jiang Wuxin earlier, but he was careless.</p><p></p><p>The most important thing is that Jian Wuhui is one of their own, and he didn't have any vigilance.</p><p></p><p>"The Lu little friend you mentioned can have a grudge with Zixuan Yong, and you both know him, he must not be ordinary, right?" Jian Wuhui teased with a smile.</p><p></p><p>Although Zixuan Yong has not entered the individual combat power ranking, his strength is not to be underestimated!</p><p></p><p>Zixuan Yong's strength is even better than Mangtian and Jiang Wuxin, and is probably very close to the individual combat power ranking.</p><p></p><p>It seems that it won't be long before Zixuan Yong will challenge the strong ones on the combat power ranking.</p><p></p><p>And his Void Beast Tribe, in the Myriad Tribes Ranking, is also not low, being among the top few hundred.</p><p></p><p>Thinking about this, Jian Wuhui sighed, his human tribe was ranked over a thousand, if not for the inter-tribal conflicts, he would have no problem entering the top hundred of the Myriad Tribes Ranking with his individual combat power ranking.</p><p></p><p>Hearing this, Mangtian and Jiang Wuxin exchanged a glance, sighed silently, and returned to their seats.</p><p></p><p>The two of them wanted to speak but held back, feeling very conflicted.</p><p></p><p>Jian Wuhui, however, was not in a hurry, sipping his tea and waiting for the two of them to continue.</p>

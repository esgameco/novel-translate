        <h1>Chapter 363</h1>
        <div class="content">
            <p>Here is my translation of the Chinese text you provided:</p><p></p><p>Swoosh!</p><p></p><p>At this moment, five beams of light flashed through the fog of war, approaching the Colorful Jade Pagoda!</p><p></p><p>The various alien races present all had their eyes narrowed, looking over.</p><p></p><p>These five beams of light should be from the relatively powerful races on the Myriad Tribe Ranking, after all, the ones who arrived here first were the alien races ranked lower.</p><p></p><p>The next moment, the five beams of light descended, transforming into five teams, each establishing their own camp!</p><p></p><p>Many of the alien races present had a cold glint in their eyes, looking apprehensively at the descended five teams.</p><p></p><p>The Void Beast Clan, the Blood Clan, the Heavenly Demon Clan, the Blazing Wolf Clan, the Nine-Winged Clan!</p><p></p><p>These five races are considered quite formidable on the Divine-Demonic Battlefield, and their rankings are extremely close to each other.</p><p></p><p>Especially the team in the middle, the leader of which is naturally the patriarch of the Void Beast Clan, Zi Xuanyong!</p><p></p><p>The name "Void Emperor" is known to all on the Divine-Demonic Battlefield.</p><p></p><p>His cultivation is infinitely close to the top of the individual combat power ranking!</p><p></p><p>"Hehe, Void Emperor!" </p><p></p><p>At this time, the leaders of the other four teams all cupped their fists and greeted Zi Xuanyong.</p><p></p><p>Zi Xuanyong looked at the four of them, who were Blood Moon Ru, Heavenly Demon King, Blazing Wolf King, and Nine-Winged King.</p><p></p><p>This time, the quest to seize the Colorful Jade is of the utmost importance, so they have all personally led their teams.</p><p></p><p>"Hehe, you four." Zi Xuanyong also cupped his fists and greeted them with a smile.</p><p></p><p>The five of them looked at each other, a strange light flashing in their eyes.</p><p></p><p>They five, have a certain... </p><p></p><p>After a brief exchange of glances, Zi Xuanyong smiled and led his clan members to the side:</p><p></p><p>"We'll just wait over here, this isn't our main stage after all..."</p><p></p><p>Blood Moon Ru and the others naturally understood Zi Xuanyong's meaning, and they also led their clan members to the side.</p><p></p><p>The other alien races seeing this, all made way, not daring to utter a word.</p><p></p><p>There were also some alien races with relatively low rankings who would greet Zi Xuanyong and the others, exchanging pleasantries.</p><p></p><p>Just then,</p><p></p><p>A golden light appeared in the mist, and countless alien races immediately looked over, sensing the aura.</p><p></p><p>The Human Clan?</p><p></p><p>Soon, a huge golden wheel appeared in the vision of many.</p><p></p><p>"It's indeed the Human Clan, this is the Scorching Sun Wheel of the Human Clan's Golden Wheel King, I wonder which Human Lord is leading the team besides him?"</p><p></p><p>"Could it be the Annihilation Sword Venerable?"</p><p></p><p>"Unlikely, if the Annihilation Sword Venerable personally leads a team to the Colorful Jade Pagoda, do you believe the alien races who have enmity with the Human Clan won't immediately launch a fierce attack on the Human Clan's territory?"</p><p></p><p>"Cough cough, that's also very possible."</p><p></p><p>"But besides the Annihilation Sword Venerable, the other four Human Lords shouldn't be underestimated either, they are also big shots on the Divine-Demonic Battlefield."</p><p></p><p>"Yes, if the Human Clan hadn't suffered suppression from many alien races, their ranking on the Myriad Tribe Ranking wouldn't have fallen outside the top thousand."</p><p></p><p>"But don't be misled by the Human Clan's ranking on the Myriad Tribe Ranking, in one-on-one combat, the Human Clan is not inferior to some of the top hundred tribes, right?"</p><p></p><p>"Of course, the Annihilation Sword Venerable is no joke."</p><p></p><p>"..."</p><p></p><p>While the many alien races were discussing animatedly,</p><p></p><p>The Scorching Sun Wheel swooped down.</p><p></p><p>Lu Changsheng and Han Jinlong's group flashed into view.</p><p></p><p>Han Jinlong casually waved his sleeve, and the Scorching Sun Wheel above was retracted!</p><p></p><p>Countless gazes converged on the Human Clan's group, scrutinizing them.</p><p></p><p>Indeed, the Human Clan's Golden Wheel King!</p><p></p><p>The other one is... the Wind Venerable?!</p><p></p><p>The alien races were not surprised by this, because in the previous Colorful Jade Pagoda, the Human Clan was also led by two Human Lords.</p><p></p><p>Normally, the alien races participating would only have one leader.</p><p></p><p>But the Human Clan is a special case, their situation is different.</p><p></p><p>Last time, the Human Clan's leaders were the Savage King and the Mace Saint.</p><p></p><p>Here is the full English translation of the Chinese excerpt:</p><p></p><p>The five members of the Purple Mysterious Palace stared at Jiang Wuxin with indecipherable expressions. </p><p></p><p>Because of the Eternal Life Body, Jiang Wuxin and the Savage Heavenly were on their must-kill list...</p><p></p><p>To kill Jiang Wuxin, they must lure him into a trap first.</p><p></p><p>Otherwise, it would be difficult to successfully eliminate him, as the reputation of the Wind Sage is not for nothing.</p><p></p><p>Fortunately, they had already made an arrangement, and it would be carried out after the Colorful Jade Pagoda event!</p><p></p><p>In addition to the five members of the Purple Mysterious Palace, there were also some other not-so-low-ranking alien races closely watching Jiang Wuxin and the others...</p><p></p><p>These were the races that had grievances with the human race and wanted to annihilate them as soon as possible.</p><p></p><p>Faced with these sinister gazes, Jiang Wuxin and Han Jinlong's eyes narrowed slightly, and they retreated to the side with Lu Changsheng and the others, under the countless scrutinizing looks.</p><p></p><p>Coincidentally, right next to them were the members of the Purple Mysterious Palace...</p><p></p><p>"Gold Wheel King, Wind Sage, it's been a while?" the Purple Mysterious Palace leader said with a half-smile.</p><p></p><p>The gazes of Blood Moon and the others swept over Lu Changsheng and the group, and then landed on Han Jinlong and Jiang Wuxin as well.</p><p></p><p>Seeing this, the alien races present all had flashing eyes.</p><p></p><p>These five races shouldn't have any grievances with the human race, right?</p><p></p><p>But why did it always feel like they had ill intentions?</p><p></p><p>The human race already had many enemies, and if these five races were added, the already immense pressure would increase even further!</p><p></p><p>Jiang Wuxin smiled slightly: "Purple Sky Emperor, what instructions do you have?"</p><p></p><p>The Purple Mysterious Palace leader looked at Han Jinlong and then smiled at Jiang Wuxin: "After the Colorful Jade Pagoda event is over, Wind Sage, don't forget to keep your appointment."</p><p></p><p>Jiang Wuxin's eyes flashed, knowing that the Purple Mysterious Palace leader was referring to the previous invitation to discuss a matter...</p><p></p><p>He then smiled and said, "Purple Sky Emperor, rest assured, as it is a crucial matter, the Savage King and I will be there as promised."</p><p></p><p>Suddenly, he said, "But it seems the Purple Sky Emperor is in a hurry?"</p><p></p><p>The Purple Mysterious Palace leader's eyes narrowed, and he smiled without any abnormality: "How could that be? Our Emperor just wants to make the human race owe us a favor."</p><p></p><p>"Hehe, then how about this, the Purple Sky Emperor can directly tell me here, don't worry, the promised reward will be paid in full."</p><p></p><p>Jiang Wuxin said solemnly.</p><p></p><p>He had to appear cautious in order not to arouse the suspicion of the Purple Mysterious Palace and the others.</p><p></p><p>Sure enough, the Purple Mysterious Palace leader smiled.</p><p></p><p>Blood Moon and the others also revealed faint smiles.</p><p></p><p>"Wind Sage, as it is a crucial matter, it would be inconvenient here. Anyway, when you and the Savage King come, our Emperor will explain it clearly to you. Of course, if you have doubts in your heart and don't believe us, you don't have to come, our Emperor will just consider it a pity."</p><p></p><p>The Purple Mysterious Palace leader said without any flaws.</p><p></p><p>"Mm." Jiang Wuxin responded with a cupped fist salute and then ended the conversation.</p><p></p><p>"Hehe."</p><p></p><p>The Purple Mysterious Palace leader nodded slightly, also tactfully stopped talking, because... the fish had already taken the bait!</p><p></p><p>Watching this scene, Han Jinlong's heart felt icy cold...</p><p></p><p>On the way here, he had learned of the purpose of the Purple Mysterious Palace and the others from Jiang Wuxin.</p><p></p><p>Hehe... using their own tactics against them, who will kill whom, it's hard to say.</p><p></p><p>As for Lu Changsheng, he had long since closed his eyes and stood there, ordinary, with only a few glances passing over him, not attracting much attention.</p><p></p><p>Next.</p><p></p><p>Tribal teams continued to arrive in the area of the Colorful Jade Pagoda!</p><p></p><p>However, most of them were middle-ranked or lower-ranked alien races, not attracting much attention.</p><p></p><p>Of course, there were also tribal teams of higher rankings, such as those in the top hundreds or even top tens.</p><p></p><p>Whenever these tribal teams arrived, they would cause a lot of commotion and attention.</p><p></p><p>But compared to these, what everyone was silently waiting for were the truly peak great clans!</p><p></p><p>Such as the Devouring Beast Tribe, the Dragon Tribe, the Fire Phoenix Tribe, the White Tiger Tribe, the Xuanwu Tribe... and the Heavenly God Tribe that had been occupying the top spot for years!</p>

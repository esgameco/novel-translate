        <h1>Chapter 437</h1>
        <div class="content">
            <p>Here is the full English translation of the Chinese excerpt:</p><p></p><p>In the Grand Audience Hall of the Imperial Court.</p><p></p><p>The officials were tense and in heated discussion, anxiously jumping around:</p><p></p><p>"Ever since the day the King imprisoned the Crown Prince Fenglan, I knew this day would come. But I never imagined Fenglan would not even issue a challenge, but launch a direct assault instead."</p><p></p><p>"Ah, what are we to do? Fenglan already has a Shenling Realm cultivator defending him, and now he's launching a surprise attack - he's not leaving us in the Yunlan Kingdom any room to maneuver at all."</p><p></p><p>"Their Crown Prince is already in our prison, so why wouldn't they fear our retaliation?"</p><p></p><p>"Heh, in my opinion, the King of Fenglan is likely willing to sacrifice Fengchang Xuan."</p><p></p><p>"How ruthless!"</p><p></p><p>"......"</p><p></p><p>Just as the officials were exchanging words, Yunze Cang appeared in the hall.</p><p></p><p>The officials noticed him and hurriedly paid their respects: "Greetings, Your Majesty!"</p><p></p><p>Yunze Cang waved his hand and said solemnly, "The Fenglan army has already breached our borders and is marching towards the capital. The situation is extremely urgent. I have no time to discuss other matters. Next..."</p><p></p><p>Yunze Cang then quickly issued a series of orders.</p><p></p><p>After finishing the orders, the officials hesitated to speak, but Yunze Cang did not give them a chance, waving his hand and saying sternly, "Dismissed. Gather at the East Gate after the preparations are complete."</p><p></p><p>"Yes." The officials reluctantly departed, their expressions resigned.</p><p></p><p>After the officials left, Yunze Cang closed his eyes and said, "Guard Captain, bring Fengchang Xuan to the East Gate."</p><p></p><p>"Yes, Your Majesty."</p><p></p><p>.........</p><p></p><p>Outside the Observation Pavilion, Ye Xunwu arrived.</p><p></p><p>"Lord Ye!" The guards hurriedly saluted.</p><p></p><p>"Mm." Ye Xunwu nodded, then looked at the entrance to the Observation Pavilion with hesitation.</p><p></p><p>Ye Xunwu was unsure if the Shenling Realm cultivator had accompanied Fenglan's forces.</p><p></p><p>If the Shenling Realm cultivator had not come, then the Yunlan Ancient Kingdom, without a Shenling Realm cultivator, would not be at a disadvantage against Fenglan.</p><p></p><p>But if the Shenling Realm cultivator had come, then the Yunlan Ancient Kingdom would be completely outmatched by Fenglan.</p><p></p><p>Ye Xunwu pondered for a moment, then decided to go in and inform the Lord in advance, just in case.</p><p></p><p>Ye Xunwu soon reached the top floor, bypassing the old tortoise's room and heading towards where Lu Changsheng was.</p><p></p><p>It would be better to directly inform the Lord to be on the safe side.</p><p></p><p>Ye Xunwu assured himself that it was not because he did not trust the old tortoise.</p><p></p><p>Knock, knock, knock.</p><p></p><p>Ye Xunwu carefully knocked on the door to Lu Changsheng's room, then respectfully said:</p><p></p><p>"My Lord, Fenglan Kingdom is marching towards the capital and is expected to arrive soon."</p><p></p><p>"Mm." After a moment, Lu Changsheng's voice came from within the room, indicating that he was already aware.</p><p></p><p>Although it was just a single word, Ye Xunwu let out a sigh of relief. This word was enough to convey that the Lord would not ignore the situation.</p><p></p><p>"Then I shall take my leave and not disturb your rest, my Lord."</p><p></p><p>Having received the expected response, Ye Xunwu bowed and took his leave.</p><p></p><p>.........</p><p></p><p>Tens of thousands of miles from the capital, a vast, dark cloud-like army was rapidly approaching the city from the sky. </p><p></p><p>This was no ordinary war between nations, but a battle between cultivators.</p><p></p><p>Every single soldier had formidable cultivation bases.</p><p></p><p>The scale of this cultivator war would undoubtedly bring devastation and calamity to the Yunlan region.</p><p></p><p>Fortunately, it was not a mundane army - if it were, the region would be left barren in their wake.</p><p></p><p>At the rear of the army were two palanquins, surrounded by generals and officials riding winged celestial horses guarding them.</p><p></p><p>The King of Fenglan glanced at the obscured figure seated calmly within one of the palanquins, his heart at ease.</p><p></p><p>With the Shenling Realm expert present, the Yunlan Kingdom would be no match for Fenglan in this battle.</p><p></p><p>Here is the full English translation of the Chinese excerpt:</p><p></p><p>Lan could already be considered as Feng Luan's possession.</p><p></p><p>Merely Yunlan, as long as the core capital is conquered, any other region would not be a problem.</p><p></p><p>"How much longer until we reach the capital of Yunlan?"</p><p></p><p>Suddenly, the mysterious Spiritual Realm expert from another imperial carriage asked indifferently.</p><p></p><p>The Feng Luan Lord was startled, sweeping his gaze across the military commanders and officials, he hastily shouted, "The Lord has spoken, why are you not quickly answering?"</p><p></p><p>Thereupon, everyone trembled and a military commander hurriedly stepped forward respectfully, "Reporting to the Lord, we are now less than 30,000 li away from the capital of Yunlan, we will soon arrive!"</p><p></p><p>"Mm." The mysterious Spiritual Realm expert responded indifferently and fell silent again.</p><p></p><p>Seeing this, the Feng Luan Lord and the officials secretly heaved a sigh of relief.</p><p></p><p>The Feng Luan Lord spoke in a solemn voice, "Relay the order, advance at full speed!"</p><p></p><p>"Yes!"</p><p></p><p>...</p><p></p><p>The capital of Yunlan had already become a place of unease.</p><p></p><p>Because outside the four great gates of the capital, north, south, east and west, there were vast Yunlan armies hovering in the sky, on guard.</p><p></p><p>Especially at the east gate, the King had even descended with the officials.</p><p></p><p>The tense standby posture was clearly a sign of an impending great battle!</p><p></p><p>The capital had also issued a ban, prohibiting anyone from entering or leaving the city.</p><p></p><p>At this moment, Yunze Cang's voice resounded throughout the entire capital from the east gate:</p><p></p><p>"Recently, the Feng Luan army has broken through our Yunlan borders, and they should be arriving at the capital soon. Everyone, rest assured, as the ruler of this country, I will stand in front of you all and defend you to the last moment."</p><p></p><p>What?! </p><p></p><p>The Feng Luan army is already attacking the capital?!</p><p></p><p>This stirred up a huge commotion!</p><p></p><p>Instantly, the civilians in the capital turned deathly pale, some even felt a bit dizzy.</p><p></p><p>It was just too sudden, who could have anticipated this?</p><p></p><p>Many people immediately wanted to flee, but when they saw the vast armies guarding the four great gates, north, south, east and west, they immediately lost their will to escape.</p><p></p><p>At the east gate.</p><p></p><p>Feng Changxuan was tightly bound with ropes, disheveled and in a disheveled state.</p><p></p><p>Feng Changxuan's gaze swept coldly over Yunze Cang, Ye Xunmang, Yun Aoye and the officials.</p><p></p><p>Yunze Cang, Ye Xunmang, Yun Aoye and the others calmly met his gaze, but the officials avoided eye contact, not daring to look at Feng Changxuan.</p><p></p><p>Feng Changxuan finally shifted his gaze back to Yunze Cang, sneering, "Yunze Cang, my Feng Luan army has arrived, you will ultimately pay the price for your wrong choice... and that price is the entire Yunlan, haha!"</p><p></p><p>As he spoke, Feng Changxuan laughed heartily, while Yunze Cang and the others had a somewhat unsightly expression.</p><p></p><p>At this moment, they really wanted to kill him directly, but Feng Changxuan could not be killed until the very last moment.</p><p></p><p>Feng Changxuan suddenly swept his gaze around and then sneered, "Where is that self-righteous young man in blue? And that arrogant old man? What, are they afraid and have shrunk back?"</p><p></p><p>Slap!</p><p></p><p>Yun Aoye could no longer endure it, he stepped forward and slapped Feng Changxuan, glaring at him sternly, "Don't forget you are a prisoner!"</p><p></p><p>"Hmph! Ptui!" Feng Changxuan turned his head and spat out the blood in his mouth, then no longer looked at Yun Aoye, but looked at Yunze Cang with an indifferent mockery, "Whatever, Yunze Cang, you'd better be able to kill this prince, otherwise, when I break free, I will personally enjoy your harem before your eyes!"</p><p></p><p>"You insolent!" Yunze Cang was furious, no longer able to hold back, and was about to strike Feng Changxuan to death with a palm strike.</p><p></p><p>But just at that moment, a violent wind suddenly arose in the heavens and earth!</p><p></p><p>In the distance, on the horizon, a vast dark cloud was rapidly moving towards the capital!</p><p>It was not a cloud, but the Feng Luan army!</p>

        <h1>Chapter 151</h1>
        <div class="content">
            <p>Here is the full English translation of the Chinese excerpt:</p><p></p><p>Afterwards,</p><p></p><p>The crowd had no choice but to slowly finish the wine in their cups, their faces filled with pain. ‚òÆ‚ôï‚ùª‚ùæùìàùì±‡∏¢–ñ.Ôº£ÔΩèùêåüíò‡∂è</p><p></p><p>But suddenly they remembered that the "Soul-Cleansing Brew" was for sale, and their moods immediately brightened.</p><p></p><p>"Waiter, give me a pot of Soul-Cleansing Brew!"</p><p></p><p>"I want two pots."</p><p></p><p>"Bring me three pots!"</p><p></p><p>"......"</p><p></p><p>In an instant, the patrons in the tavern one after another eagerly called out to the young waiter.</p><p></p><p>Hearing this, Tong Xin, remembering Long Sheng's instructions before the opening, apologetically said, "Esteemed guests, I'm afraid today is our opening day, and we only have one free cup of Soul-Cleansing Brew. As for selling it, please come back tomorrow morning."</p><p></p><p>Luo Qi Ran, Peng Fang, and the others were immediately dejected, even forgetting the purpose of coming to this tavern.</p><p></p><p>"Alright then."</p><p></p><p>The crowd was unwilling, truly wanting to seize Long Sheng's tavern, but their rationality told them they absolutely could not do that!</p><p></p><p>In the end, they could only smack their lips and collectively bow towards the rocking chair where Long Sheng sat, saying, "Proprietor, then we shall take our leave first, thank you for the hospitality."</p><p></p><p>Seeing Long Sheng pay them no heed, Luo Qi Ran, Peng Fang, and the others left reluctantly under Tong Xin's seeing-off.</p><p></p><p>But just as they exited the tavern, the crowd suddenly snapped back to their senses - weren't they here to investigate the purpose?</p><p></p><p>However, thinking of the peerless Soul-Cleansing Brew, their hearts found much comfort, feeling they had gained quite a harvest.</p><p></p><p>Afterwards,</p><p></p><p>One group of cultivators after another entered the tavern, all becoming intoxicated in the Soul-Cleansing Brew and unable to extricate themselves, forgetting their original purpose.</p><p></p><p>They marveled at how there could be such a unique and excellent brew in the world, regretting that they, who had licked the blade's edge, had truly lived like dogs in the past.</p><p></p><p>All the cultivators wanted to take some away, but upon hearing the tavern's rules, they gave up.</p><p></p><p>As night fell, Tong Xin and Lin Dong saw off the last batch of cultivators, then creakily closed the courtyard gate.</p><p></p><p>The two heaved a long sigh, flinging the rag over their shoulders, their faces weary, a weariness of the soul.</p><p></p><p>Tong Xin looked up at the faintly visible crack in the night sky, saying, "At night, that crack becomes a bit hard to see. We've been here at the Heavenly Scar for a while now, this place... is truly special."</p><p></p><p>Lin Dong, hearing this, lifted his head to gaze at the heavens, wryly smiling, "Elder Brother, let's not think about these things for now. We haven't even been outside yet, we should focus on managing the Proprietor's tavern first."</p><p></p><p>Tong Xin chuckled mischievously, furtively glancing inside the tavern, then curiously whispering, "Little Brother, do you think the Proprietor opened this tavern for some purpose?"</p><p></p><p>Lin Dong was slightly taken aback, muttering, "How could we possibly guess the Proprietor's thoughts? Elder Brother, we shouldn't think about it... you might get disciplined by the Proprietor."</p><p></p><p>"Mm." Tong Xin shuddered, laughing awkwardly, then sighed, "It's been almost ten years, I wonder how Big Saber Brother and the Sect Master are doing at the White Moon Sect."</p><p></p><p>"Elder Brother, you can rest assured. With the Proprietor's prestige, I'm sure Master and the others are living much more comfortably than us two." Lin Dong smiled.</p><p></p><p>"It's been a busy day, come inside and have something to eat."</p><p></p><p>At this moment, Long Sheng's voice sounded from within the tavern.</p><p></p><p>Eat...?</p><p></p><p>Tong Xin and Lin Dong paused, but quickly responded respectfully, "Yes."</p><p></p><p>...</p><p></p><p>Inside the tavern, under the soft lighting,</p><p></p><p>Tong Xin and Lin Dong sat stiffly, staring dumbly at the two steaming bowls of soup placed on the table before them.</p><p></p><p>The two were amazed - could this be the Proprietor's own cooking?</p><p></p><p>From the rocking chair, Long Sheng stood up and headed towards the inner room, lightly saying as he walked, "Drink the soup and then rest early."</p><p></p><p>Tong Xin and Lin Dong immediately stood up, bowing deeply, "Yes, Proprietor."</p><p></p><p>After Long Sheng disappeared into the inner room, Tong Xin and...</p><p></p><p>Here is the full English translation of the excerpt from the Chinese novel:</p><p></p><p>Lin Dongcai slowly sat down.</p><p></p><p>The two gently pursed their lips, then picked up the bowls and gulped down the steaming hot soup in one go.</p><p></p><p>Hmm, aside from being hot, there didn't seem to be anything particularly special about the taste.</p><p></p><p>But as soon as they finished, they felt a strange sensation spread throughout their bodies. A robust, warm feeling radiated from their abdomens, spreading out to their four limbs and the eight extraordinary meridians!</p><p></p><p>Like crashing waves on the shore, one after another!</p><p></p><p>"This..." </p><p></p><p>Tongxin and Lin Dongcai looked at each other in shock, then their faces lit up with delight as they hurried to their respective rooms.</p><p></p><p>They remembered the voice transmission from their master ten years ago when they parted ways at the White Moon Sect: "Follow the gentleman, this immense karmic blessing must be grasped firmly!"</p><p></p><p>Sure enough, the master's gift had arrived so quickly!</p><p></p><p>At the same time, </p><p></p><p>in Lu Changsheng's room, he sat quietly on the bed, listening to the movements of Tongxin and Lin Dongcai, and smiled.</p><p></p><p>Under the warm lamplight, Lu Changsheng's black eyes flickered slightly.</p><p></p><p>Opening the Longevity Inn in the Heavenly Scar, aside from passing the time on a whim, there was another reason... to make the name of the Longevity Inn resound throughout the world of the Heavenly Scar, </p><p></p><p>and to make his own name, Lu Changsheng, echo through this realm.</p><p></p><p>The purpose was simple - to draw out those who had once united to suppress him in the immortal tomb, those who coveted his eternal life body.</p><p></p><p>As time passed, his general memories had been restored, but exactly who those people were remained hazy in his mind.</p><p></p><p>He only knew that among them, there was a group right here in the Heavenly Scar.</p><p></p><p>Although the hundred million years in the tomb were not considered long for him, and did not delay anything, this account still needed to be settled.</p><p></p><p>But how did his strength increase so greatly during that hundred million years of slumber?</p><p></p><p>Lu Changsheng gently rubbed his fingers, his brow slightly furrowed.</p><p></p><p>His eternal life body did not require cultivation, and with the flow of the great river of time, his strength would grow slowly but steadily each day.</p><p></p><p>So the dramatic increase in strength during his slumber was indeed quite puzzling...</p><p></p><p>Lu Changsheng looked down at his palm and murmured, "Could it be that my eternal life body has undergone some changes?"</p><p></p><p>In this world, Lu Changsheng understood everyone well, except... himself.</p><p></p><p>Lu Changsheng's brow suddenly relaxed, and he sighed, "What's the use of thinking about this? Since I am immortal, time will give me the answer."</p><p></p><p>With that, his expression became calm, and he closed his eyes, as if falling into a deep sleep.</p><p></p><p>At the same time,</p><p></p><p>Qingxuan Town was extremely lively!</p><p></p><p>Even at night, there were cultivator figures all over the streets and alleys. Unusually, no one was fighting, but all were excitedly boasting and chatting.</p><p></p><p>"Fellow Daoists, you weren't at the Longevity Inn today. You don't know, the innkeeper there is a super expert! The aura he exuded at the time completely crushed all of us thousands of people present! Luckily the innkeeper had no intention to kill, otherwise everyone here would have had no chance of escape!"</p><p></p><p>"Whew! That powerful? Based on what you're saying, although the inn is called the Longevity Inn, which sounds arrogant, the owner has the strength to back it up!"</p><p></p><p>"So, what realm do you estimate the innkeeper to be at?"</p><p></p><p>"In my opinion, the innkeeper's cultivation level is at least on par with the lord of the Heavenly Snake Manor, a Venerable Immortal-level expert. As for which specific Venerable Immortal rank, I can't say for sure."</p><p></p><p>"Whew..."</p><p></p><p>Note: (The realm divisions in the Heavenly Scar are the same as in the Four Directions Immortal Realm, except that the Immortal Emperor realm in the Four Directions Immortal Realm has no ranks, while the Heavenly Scar's Immortal Emperor realm is divided into nine ranks. After the Immortal Emperor realm, there is also an Immortal Ancestor realm, also divided into nine ranks.)</p>

        <h1>Chapter 472</h1>
        <div class="content">
            <p>Here is the full English translation of the Chinese excerpt:</p><p></p><p>"Mr. Xie," </p><p></p><p>He Tianjun stood up and then, emulating her daughter's respectful address to Lu Changsheng, gave a courteous bow.</p><p></p><p>He Tianjun was very clear about her own situation - she was supposed to have died already, but this young man in blue had somehow used some method to forcibly extend her lifespan for a period of time.</p><p></p><p>Lu Changsheng nodded slightly and softly said, "Xiao Tong, first take your mother outside the He Clan."</p><p></p><p>"Yes."</p><p></p><p>He Xitong vaguely guessed something, so she hurriedly supported He Tianjun and disappeared.</p><p></p><p>Lu Changsheng did not even glance at He Yanqi, who was kneeling there in utter despair, and slowly walked to the edge of the Tianxiang Tower, hands clasped behind his back, surveying the countless ancient clan figures below.</p><p></p><p>"All ancient clans that supported the He Clan this time, cut your cultivation by half, and I will not pursue it further."</p><p></p><p>As soon as the words fell, except for the members of the He Clan, the entire audience of ancient clans was in an uproar.</p><p></p><p>But it was not because they felt the punishment was too severe, but rather because the punishment was much lighter than they had imagined!</p><p></p><p>Especially Ouyang Mo and the others, they all heaved a huge sigh of relief. Although cutting their cultivation by half was quite harsh, compared to being alive, it was nothing!</p><p></p><p>Soon, all the clan members present from the Ouyang Clan and the sixty top-tier ancient clans decisively cut off half of their own cultivation!</p><p></p><p>In an instant, an incredibly mighty outpouring of spiritual energy and profound spiritual power was released, returning to the natural world.</p><p></p><p>With the cultivation of so many powerful experts being replenished, the spiritual energy and profound spiritual power in the ancient Xuanwu Realm had become unprecedentedly rich at this moment.</p><p></p><p>It can be said that the ancient Xuanwu Realm is about to be reshuffled again, and the Ouyang Clan and these sixty top-tier ancient clans will inevitably face many challenges due to the drastic decline in their strength, and their future situation will be extremely difficult.</p><p></p><p>In fact, the punishment was quite severe.</p><p></p><p>"We thank the great lord for his magnanimity," </p><p></p><p>After cutting their cultivation, Ouyang Mo and the others weakly kowtowed to Lu Changsheng, thanking him for not killing them.</p><p></p><p>Lu Changsheng suddenly looked towards the Hong Clan camp, or more precisely, towards the lowered head of Hong Wujue standing there without the slightest movement.</p><p></p><p>The already nervous and fearful Hong Wujue, sensing Lu Changsheng's gaze, almost peed his pants!</p><p></p><p>"If you don't seize the opportunity, then go die."</p><p></p><p>As soon as Lu Changsheng's words fell, Hong Wujue exploded into a mist of blood!</p><p></p><p>This sudden commotion startled everyone's souls!</p><p></p><p>Glancing over, the crowd was horrified to see that in the Hong Clan camp, Hong Wujue, the clan leader, was gone...</p><p></p><p>The young man in blue had just spoken a sentence, and Hong Wujue was gone!</p><p></p><p>This was too terrifying!</p><p></p><p>At this moment, the Hong Clan disciples were trembling in fear, and Hong Wangjun, the clan elder, knelt there trembling, "G-great lord, you gave him a chance, but Hong Wujue did not cherish it, he deserved to die. This old man was going to deal with him, but I was too slow..."</p><p></p><p>On the Ye Clan side, all the Ye Clan disciples were swallowing hard. </p><p></p><p>They admitted that they had misjudged, the Lu Elder they had been chatting and joking with every day turned out to be so domineering, killing without blinking an eye...</p><p></p><p>Afterwards, Lu Changsheng did not utter another word, nor did he even glance at the astonished He Lian, and with hands clasped behind his back, he strode away towards the outside of the He Clan.</p><p></p><p>Huh?</p><p></p><p>All the ancient clans hurriedly followed towards the outside of the He Clan as well, but in their hearts they were puzzled, did Lord Lu really spare the He Clan?!</p><p></p><p>Ouyang Mo and the others felt a bit off-balance, unable to understand why they had all cut their cultivation by half, while the He Clan, the real culprits, had not received any punishment at all...</p><p></p><p>But Ouyang Mo and the others dared not say more, silently following the large group of ancient clans to the outside of the He Clan.</p><p></p><p>"E-elder... he, he..."</p><p></p><p>He Lian's expression was constantly changing.</p><p></p><p>Here is the full English translation of the Chinese excerpt:</p><p></p><p>The blue-robed man somehow managed to bypass the He Clan, which was quite unbelievable.</p><p></p><p>Many of the He Clan's disciples were now sitting on the ground, panting heavily, their expressions akin to survivors of a calamity.</p><p></p><p>At this moment, He Yan Ci from the Heavenly Pavilion appeared beside He Lian, his gaze bitter as he looked towards the direction where Lü Chang Sheng and the various ancient clans' forces had departed, and said with difficulty:</p><p></p><p>"Activate the Clan Protection Formation... Even Ou Yang Mo and the others have had their cultivation reduced by half, he won't possibly let the He Clan off so easily..."</p><p></p><p>He Lian's eyes flickered, and he also erased the last glimmer of hope in his heart.</p><p></p><p>The many surviving He Clan disciples who heard He Yan Ci's words also changed expression, quickly rising from the ground, their faces filled with trepidation and tension!</p><p></p><p>"Ancestor, how could the Clan Protection Formation possibly stop him..." He Lian said in a daze.</p><p></p><p>He Yan Ci's tone became a little hurried, his voice trembling: "Whether it can stop him or not, what does it matter? Are we just going to wait for death and do nothing?!"</p><p></p><p>...</p><p></p><p>Suddenly, a buzzing sound startled the numerous ancient clan members outside the He Clan. They hastily turned around and saw the He Clan being shrouded by a faintly visible light barrier.</p><p></p><p>"Sss, the He Clan has activated their Clan Protection Formation?"</p><p></p><p>"What is the He Clan doing? Didn't the blue-robed gentleman pardon them?"</p><p></p><p>"Yes, it's really puzzling."</p><p></p><p>"..."</p><p></p><p>The crowd murmured among themselves, unable to resist glancing at the blue-robed man.</p><p></p><p>Lü Chang Sheng, however, looked towards He Xi Tong and her mother, asking, "Do you have any attachment to the He Clan?"</p><p></p><p>He Tian Jun's eyes flickered, about to speak, but He Xi Tong quickly said, "Sir, no!"</p><p></p><p>Lü Chang Sheng nodded, then turned his head to look at the vast He Clan, a blue light flashing in his eyes...</p><p></p><p>"Clang—Boom!"</p><p></p><p>The He Clan's Clan Protection Formation instantly shattered, and immediately after, the vast He Clan exploded in the sky, like a gigantic firework.</p><p></p><p>Everyone watched the scene with trembling bodies, as if they had fallen into an icy abyss.</p><p></p><p>They couldn't understand, they couldn't understand at all how the He Clan had been blown up.</p><p></p><p>There were no fluctuations of divine elements or profound energies, nor any display of laws...</p><p></p><p>All the terrifying techniques of the blue-robed gentleman had completely overturned their understanding.</p><p></p><p>"The matter is done, let's return to the clan," Lü Chang Sheng said, brushing off his sleeves, and looked at the dazed Ye Zhui Yue.</p><p></p><p>"Ah, yes, yes, return to the clan!" Ye Zhui Yue hurriedly came to his senses.</p><p></p><p>Thereafter, under the respectful gaze of the crowd, Lü Chang Sheng and the mother-daughter duo of He Xi Tong disappeared into the sky with the Ye Clan.</p><p></p><p>The eyes of the ancient clan members were filled with envy, for they knew that the Ye Clan was truly about to rise to prominence.</p><p></p><p>It was even possible that in the future, this Hollow Ancient Realm would be dominated by the Ye Clan.</p><p></p><p>The He Clan had been annihilated, the Ou Yang Clan's overall strength had been reduced by half, and only the Hong Clan had fared a little better, though they had lost their clan leader.</p><p></p><p>But everyone knew that as long as the blue-robed gentleman was around, the Hong Clan would not dare to act recklessly.</p><p></p><p>Even if the blue-robed gentleman left the Qian Kun Heavens, the Hong Clan probably wouldn't dare to be too unrestrained.</p><p></p><p>Because the blue-robed gentleman's techniques were truly too extraordinary and bizarre, something they had never seen in cultivators before, more akin to a true divine being whose words became reality.</p><p></p><p>They were truly afraid of him.</p>

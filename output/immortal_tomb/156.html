        <h1>Chapter 156</h1>
        <div class="content">
            <p>Here is the full English translation of the Chinese excerpt:</p><p></p><p>Left Qiu Shan's hand holding the wine cup froze in mid-air. ‚Ü§‚Ü§‚Ü§‚Ü§‚Ü§ ‚ûÖ‚ûàÔº≥·ïºùìæùïè.Âåö‡πèœª ‚Ü¶‚Ü¶‚Ü¶‚Ü¶‚Ü¶</p><p></p><p>Although Su Qianghe sighed in regret, he was already quite satisfied with this result!</p><p></p><p>As long as the shopkeeper doesn't go to the other three forces, whether he comes or not, it doesn't matter to his force, as long as there is the Xihun Liquor to drink!</p><p></p><p>The only thing he's afraid of is being recruited by Left Qiu Shan, and in the future, he'll have to go to their door to ask for the Xihun Liquor, and see their expressions!!</p><p></p><p>"Shopkeeper, are you really unwilling to join my Tiansheshu?"</p><p></p><p>Left Qiu Shan asked in a deep voice, and the hand gripping the wine cup was gradually tightening...</p><p></p><p>Seeing this, Su Qianghe suddenly stood up and shouted:</p><p></p><p>"What's the matter? If the shopkeeper wants to join, he can join; if he doesn't want to, he doesn't have to. Left Qiu Shan, I tell you today, I stand on the shopkeeper's side. Qingxuan Town has finally got such a good tavern, and if the shopkeeper is driven away by you, my Juxu Gang will fight to the death with your Tiansheshu!!"</p><p></p><p>Yin Jiukui and Zhao Wuyou also stood up, putting pressure on Left Qiu Shan and expressing their stance!</p><p></p><p>Originally, they thought this Changsheng Tavern had come to Qingxuan Town to occupy a share, but who knew it was here to sell the peerless good liquor!</p><p></p><p>In that case, the situation is different. Changsheng Tavern must stay, must stay in this Qingxuan Town!</p><p></p><p>Otherwise, how will they drink the Xihun Liquor in the future?</p><p></p><p>If they haven't tasted it, it doesn't matter, but now that they have tasted it, they have already fallen deeply into it.</p><p></p><p>As long as the shopkeeper doesn't join the Tiansheshu, everything will be fine.</p><p></p><p>Left Qiu Shan was already one rank ahead of them, and if his Tiansheshu added another Immortal Venerable, he would truly become the overlord of Qingxuan Town.</p><p></p><p>Left Qiu Shan's gaze narrowed, struggling in his heart, but after a moment, he thought of the Xihun Liquor and ultimately gave in.</p><p></p><p>He was not afraid of Su Qianghe alone, but with the addition of Yin Jiukui and Zhao Wuyou, he had to be more cautious.</p><p></p><p>And then there was the Xihun Liquor, which he really couldn't let go.</p><p></p><p>"What? Judging from your previous attitude, if I don't join your Tiansheshu, you're going to fight with me?"</p><p></p><p>At this moment, Lu Changsheng, who had been lying on the rocking chair, slowly got up and stood in front of Left Qiu Shan.</p><p></p><p>His calm eyes looked at him indifferently.</p><p></p><p>The tavern fell silent.</p><p></p><p>Except for the downcast Tongxin, everyone looked at Lu Changsheng in disbelief.</p><p></p><p>What does this mean? Judging from Left Qiu Shan's previous expression, he had already compromised, so why did the tavern owner still come forward...</p><p></p><p>After all, Left Qiu Shan is a Sixth-Grade Immortal Venerable!</p><p></p><p>In a sense, it would not be an exaggeration to say that he is the number one person in Qingxuan Town...</p><p></p><p>"Shopkeeper, shopkeeper..." Su Qianghe looked worried, hesitating to speak.</p><p></p><p>But Lu Changsheng gently waved his hand, stopping his next words.</p><p></p><p>Looking at those eyes, Left Qiu Shan unconsciously averted his gaze, feeling a sense of awe towards those eyes, and then said in a low voice, "Shopkeeper Lu, your Xihun Liquor is very good. If you don't want to join my Tiansheshu, then don't. The lord of my house... will not force you."</p><p></p><p>Hearing this, Left Qi Ran on the side felt her tense nerves relax a bit. She didn't know why, but she had an intuition that this shopkeeper should not be provoked!</p><p></p><p>Upon hearing this, Su Qianghe and the others were shocked, all looking at Left Qiu Shan in amazement.</p><p></p><p>When did Left Qiu Shan become so easy to talk to?</p><p></p><p>"Your previous attitude was not like this at all. If it weren't for them standing against you, you would have probably tied me back to your Tiansheshu, wouldn't you..." Lu Changsheng said with a mysterious smile.</p><p></p><p>Left Qiu Shan's body trembled, and he laughed dryly, "The shopkeeper is joking."</p><p></p><p>"Joking?" </p><p></p><p>Lu Changsheng's voice paused, and he said indifferently, "Kneel down."</p><p></p><p>Left Qiu Shan suddenly raised his head, thinking he had heard wrong, but the next moment, his expression changed drastically!</p><p></p><p>In the shocked and bewildered gaze of the crowd, he bent his knees and knelt down heavily on the ground with a thud!</p><p></p><p>"Lord Qiu, you..." Yin Jiukui was stunned, but before he could finish,</p><p></p><p>Left Qiu Shan, kneeling and trembling, said, "Senior, it's Qiu Shan... I was presumptuous."</p><p></p><p>Hearing this, Su Qianghe and the others were greatly shocked.</p><p></p><p>At this moment, they finally understood that the tavern owner in front of them was a super powerhouse!</p><p></p><p>Just by his aura, he had suppressed the Sixth-Grade Immortal Venerable Left Qiu Shan like this...</p><p></p><p>Here is the full English translation of the excerpt from the Chinese novel:</p><p></p><p>It's impossible to be a Seventh-Grade Immortal Venerable, and it's also impossible to be an Eighth-Grade Immortal Venerable, and it's also difficult to become a Ninth-Grade Immortal Venerable...</p><p></p><p>New 69 Book Bar ‚Üí 69shu.com</p><p></p><p>In that case... an Immortal, an Immortal Emperor?</p><p></p><p>Su Qianghe and the other two hurriedly knelt down!</p><p></p><p>When Zuo Qizhan and the other celestial youths saw this, although they were still bewildered, they also knelt down in unison.</p><p></p><p>Since their elders had knelt down, they must kneel down as well.</p><p></p><p>Lu Changsheng suddenly smiled and said softly, "Since you didn't have the intention to kill, I won't punish you for offending the Heavenly Snake Manor. Go and kneel outside the courtyard for three days, then serve as a gatekeeper to maintain order for three years."</p><p></p><p>His words were not a discussion, but an order.</p><p></p><p>Su Qianghe and the others felt their scalps tingle. To have the mighty lord of the Heavenly Snake Manor kneel for three days and then serve as a gatekeeper for three years? </p><p></p><p>If the outer disciples saw this, they would be mocked for the rest of their lives.</p><p></p><p>And although three years is not long for them normally, it would be extremely torturous in this situation.</p><p></p><p>Zuo Qouxian's pupils contracted, and he began to imagine himself kneeling outside and serving as a gatekeeper, with those cultivators looking at him strangely.</p><p></p><p>For a top power like him from the Qingxuan Realm, this was worse than being killed. It was a complete loss of face.</p><p></p><p>But he didn't want to die, and he couldn't die, as he still had important things to do, and he had a pair of children and the Heavenly Snake Manor behind him...</p><p></p><p>Immediately, Zuo Qouxian dejectedly kowtowed and said, "Qouxian... will obey the order."</p><p></p><p>"Mm, you may all rise." Lu Changsheng turned and lay back down in the rocking chair, closing his eyes. "Finish the remaining wine and then go."</p><p></p><p>"Thank you, senior."</p><p></p><p>Zuo Qouxian and the others slowly stood up, made a salute, and silently returned to their seats.</p><p></p><p>The four power leaders were now somewhat uneasy.</p><p></p><p>Su Qianghe picked up the two wine jars on the table and carefully said with a bow, "Senior, I, Su Qianghe, will take my leave now."</p><p></p><p>Yin Jiukui and Zhao Wuyo also had the same intention, picking up the wine jars and standing up.</p><p></p><p>Just as they were about to leave, Tongxin hurriedly said, "Esteemed guests, the wine from this shop cannot be taken out, and... you haven't settled the bill yet..."</p><p></p><p>Suddenly, Su Qianghe and the others' hearts skipped a beat. They were about to sneak out without paying and breaking the rules!</p><p></p><p>They quickly looked at Lu Changsheng, seeing him lying quietly without saying anything, and secretly let out a sigh of relief.</p><p></p><p>They sat back down again, determined to finish the precious and delicious Xiunian Wine.</p><p></p><p>So they drank in silence, occasionally sighing over the good wine.</p><p></p><p>As for Zuo Qizhan and the others, they were watching eagerly from the side.</p><p></p><p>After about the time it takes to drink a cup of tea, the group finally stood up to leave.</p><p></p><p>"Waiter, how much is it?"</p><p></p><p>Su Qianghe asked politely, his attitude much better than before.</p><p></p><p>"Esteemed guests, one jar of Xiunian Wine is three pieces of Rainbow-Colored Spirit Stones," Tongxin replied.</p><p></p><p>Three pieces of Rainbow-Colored Spirit Stones?!</p><p></p><p>(The proportions of Spirit Stones were mentioned earlier: low-grade, mid-grade, high-grade, supreme, and rainbow-colored, with a ratio of 1:1000.)</p><p></p><p>Although the four power leaders were slightly shocked by the price, they quickly accepted it. Such a good wine was indeed worth it.</p><p></p><p>After receiving thirty-six pieces of Rainbow-Colored Spirit Stones, Tongxin was overjoyed and couldn't contain his excitement.</p><p></p><p>In the Spiritual Dust Realm, even supreme-grade Spirit Stones were rare, let alone Rainbow-Colored ones.</p><p></p><p>"Senior, we shall take our leave."</p><p></p><p>The group saluted Lu Changsheng and then retreated out the door, with Tongxin quickly collecting the Spirit Stones and seeing them off.</p><p></p><p>The short distance from the inn to the courtyard gate felt like an eternity for Zuo Qouxian, and it was extremely agonizing!</p><p></p><p>His expression was grim, unable to imagine the scene of him kneeling in front of the many outer disciples of the Qingxuan Realm.</p><p></p><p>How embarrassing and humiliating that would be...</p><p></p><p>The others knew Zuo Qouxian's thoughts and remained silent. Su Qianghe and the three power leaders wanted to comfort him, but the words got stuck in their throats.</p><p></p><p>Zuo You's expression was also very unpleasant. He didn't know whether he should quickly return to the manor or kneel with his uncle. But if he knelt, he felt he wouldn't be able to bear it.</p><p></p><p>Soon, they arrived at the courtyard gate.</p><p></p><p>Outside the gate, there was a sea of people, with countless gazes focused on the gate.</p>

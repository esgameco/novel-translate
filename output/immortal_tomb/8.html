        <h1>Chapter 8</h1>
        <div class="content">
            <p>Here is the full English translation of the Chinese excerpt:</p><p></p><p>It was night.</p><p></p><p>There seemed to be a hazy black smoke drifting in the sky...</p><p></p><p>"Lord Zhen! Lord Zhen! This is bad!" </p><p></p><p>In the darkness, the steward called out anxiously outside Chen Datao's bedroom.</p><p></p><p>During this sensitive period, Chen Datao naturally couldn't be negligent, his nerves were always taut. Even when sleeping with his own wife, he wouldn't take off his clothes.</p><p></p><p>So the moment he heard the steward's call, he burst out of the room, staring at the steward and asking nervously, "What's wrong? Has a demon appeared?!"</p><p></p><p>The steward was stunned for a moment, amazed at how alert the lord was...</p><p></p><p>He then said solemnly, "Lord, we just received a report that all the people in Household No. 67 in the town have died mysteriously and tragically! The town guard has already sealed off the scene, it's very likely that a demon is behind this!"</p><p></p><p>Chen Datao's body shook violently, and a surge of anger appeared on his face!</p><p></p><p>All the people in Household No. 67 had died tragically!</p><p></p><p>"Let's go to the scene!!" Chen Datao immediately roared, and strode out.</p><p></p><p>The steward hurried to follow, hesitating, "Lord, for safety's sake, should we call the Master...?"</p><p></p><p>Chen Datao's steps paused, and he sighed lightly while looking at the night, "Never mind, it's so late, let's not disturb the Master now. Let's go see the situation first..."</p><p></p><p>"Yes..."</p><p></p><p>The two figures quickly disappeared into the darkness.</p><p></p><p>At the same time, in the back garden of the lord's manor.</p><p></p><p>Lu Changsheng stood alone, leaning against the pavilion, occasionally taking a sip of wine. His eyes emitted a strange blue glow as he quietly watched a certain direction in the town.</p><p></p><p>...</p><p></p><p>...</p><p></p><p>In the past, the people of Moyu Town would have extinguished their lights and rested by this time. But tonight, the town was brightly lit!</p><p></p><p>An hour ago, that chilling, piercing scream that tore through the night, everyone had heard it.</p><p></p><p>At this moment, a crowd of people stood in front of a manor.</p><p></p><p>They looked pale as they stared at the manor.</p><p></p><p>In front of the manor, many town guards stood guard, holding torches.</p><p></p><p>"What exactly happened at the Qian Manor? What was that tragic scream about?"</p><p></p><p>"Ah, by the time we got here, the Qian Manor was already surrounded by the town guard. We couldn't get in at all, and the guards wouldn't say anything. How can we sleep peacefully? That scream sent shivers down my spine."</p><p></p><p>"Haven't you noticed? The Qian Manor is deathly silent, except for the movement of the town guards, there's not a single sound..."</p><p></p><p>"..."</p><p></p><p>Just as the commoners were discussing and speculating, the steward's voice rang out.</p><p></p><p>"Make way, the Lord is coming!"</p><p></p><p>The Lord is coming?!</p><p></p><p>The commoners felt as if they had found their backbone, and quickly looked over.</p><p></p><p>Sure enough, they saw Chen Datao striding through the crowd with an impassive expression, quickly approaching the manor.</p><p></p><p>"Lord."</p><p>"Lord."</p><p>"..."</p><p></p><p>The commoners knelt and greeted him respectfully. It was clear that Chen Datao was quite beloved in Moyu Town.</p><p></p><p>Chen Datao and the steward reached the manor gate, suddenly stopping and turning to look at the commoners with a forced smile. "Everyone, please rise. Don't panic, I, the Lord, will go in and check the situation. I will give you all an explanation."</p><p></p><p>The commoners were immediately moved, nodding their heads. They silently admired, "The Lord is truly a good official."</p><p></p><p>Seeing that the commoners had been temporarily pacified, Chen Datao took a deep breath and, along with the steward and the town guard captain, pushed open the door and stepped into the Qian Manor.</p><p></p><p>With a "bang", the door closed again.</p><p></p><p>The area became quiet, as everyone waited in silence.</p><p></p><p>...</p><p></p><p>ɯoɔ˙xnɥs69 bar 69 new</p><p></p><p>As the three of them stepped into the courtyard, the first thing that caught their eye was...</p><p></p><p>Here is the full English translation of the Chinese excerpt:</p><p></p><p>The ground was covered with layer after layer of white cloth-covered bodies...</p><p></p><p>Chen Dadao's forehead was beaded with cold sweat. He swept his gaze across the scene - no more, no less, exactly sixty-seven bodies.</p><p></p><p>"Lord, the entire Qian household has been killed, and the bodies are all here."</p><p></p><p>The garrison commander bowed slightly, with a hint of self-blame in his tone. In his eyes, as the garrison commander, the Qian household was attacked right under his watch, and he could not escape the blame.</p><p></p><p>Chen Dadao asked in a stern voice, "Were they killed by humans or demons?"</p><p></p><p>The garrison commander hesitated for a moment, then gritted his teeth and replied firmly, "Not by humans."</p><p></p><p>Chen Dadao took a deep breath and walked to the nearest body, crouching down to lift the white cloth.</p><p></p><p>A shriveled corpse appeared before the three men's eyes. The expression on the face was frozen in terror, and there were no wounds on the entire body...</p><p></p><p>Chen Dadao swallowed hard and continued to uncover the second, third, and fourth bodies.</p><p></p><p>"Lord, the cause of death is exactly the same for every body - they are all shriveled, as if their entire blood supply has been drained, and their expressions are full of terror, as if they saw something extremely horrifying before their deaths," the garrison commander explained, pursing his lips.</p><p></p><p>Chen Dadao slowly stood up, his legs visibly trembling. He scanned the surroundings and said in a hoarse voice, "Many towns in the eastern part of the Water Emperor's Empire have been plagued by demons... Now it seems that our Moyu Town has also been affected."</p><p></p><p>The garrison commander's expression changed - he didn't know about this news.</p><p></p><p>The steward said, "News of the demon-plagued towns has been completely suppressed. I guess the Empire is afraid that it will have a widespread impact and disrupt the people's livelihoods. The lord and I only learned of it through some informal channels a few days ago."</p><p></p><p>The garrison commander nodded stiffly, then looked at Chen Dadao and said with difficulty, "Lord... The demon is now within Moyu Town, and it may even... be watching us in secret at this very moment!"</p><p></p><p>Hearing this, Chen Dadao and the steward felt a chill run down their spines as they looked around, a sense of terror overwhelming them.</p><p></p><p>"And to have killed sixty-seven people in such a short time, it's likely not just a single demon," the garrison commander said solemnly.</p><p></p><p>Chen Dadao murmured, "Not just a single demon..."</p><p></p><p>The steward frowned and said, "Garrison commander, if you suspect the demons are still in the Qian household, why haven't they attacked us yet? We are mere mortals, and they could easily kill us in an instant, right?"</p><p></p><p>Chen Dadao's eyes lit up, and he pointed at the steward, exclaiming, "You're right!"</p><p></p><p>He realized the steward's mind was quick.</p><p></p><p>The garrison commander shook his head and chuckled, "Steward, you're mistaken."</p><p></p><p>Both Chen Dadao and the steward were taken aback, and they listened as the garrison commander continued:</p><p></p><p>"The lord and the steward are unaware, but the garrison and town guards have already studied the habits of demons. While they could easily kill us mortals, demons often enjoy striking unexpectedly, reveling in the element of surprise and creating various forms of panic, delighting in people's fear. Even though they possess the power to destroy us, they still prefer to play a cat-and-mouse game."</p><p></p><p>Chen Dadao and the steward were stunned, realizing there was such a perspective.</p><p></p><p>"Lord, based on the garrison commander's words, the demons seem to enjoy having people in a state of fear, so they may not make a move for the time being. However, we can't be certain. What should we do next?" the steward asked Chen Dadao bitterly, as there were still countless civilians outside the Qian household waiting for an explanation.</p><p></p><p>Chen Dadao swept his gaze over the bodies, his eyes flickering. Then, he looked towards the direction of the lord's manor and gritted his teeth, saying, "Summon the lord!"</p>

        <h1>Chapter 194</h1>
        <div class="content">
            <p>Here is the full English translation of the Chinese excerpt:</p><p></p><p>Zhu Xingqiu's domineering words fell,</p><p></p><p>The entire venue fell completely silent. </p><p></p><p>The cultivators immediately understood that the terrifying aura that had just flashed by was released by him......</p><p></p><p>Shocked, they were guessing whether this elder was an elder of the Xiaoyao Sect, or even the Sect Master?</p><p></p><p>After all, that aura......</p><p></p><p>Zhu Xingqiu glanced at Cai Xu and Huang Bin, then looked down at the crowd and said indifferently, "Those of you who have failed the assessment, leave quickly, don't occupy the space."</p><p></p><p>Hearing this, many Xiaoyao Sect disciples immediately began to clear the venue with cold expressions.</p><p></p><p>They were the kind of people from the Black Sha Domain, so their temperament was naturally different from ordinary people.</p><p></p><p>And now, backed by the big tree that is the Sect Master, they felt that they did not need to care about anyone's face out there! Nor did they need to give any unpleasant people a good face!</p><p></p><p>They were very clear about how powerful their own Sect Master was!!</p><p></p><p>Seeing this, many cultivators who had failed the assessment and were unwilling to leave could only leave one by one, filled with fear.</p><p></p><p>And at this moment,</p><p></p><p>The people of the Huoyan Hall and Sengluo Gate finally arrived!!</p><p></p><p>Their conspicuous sect uniforms quickly attracted everyone's attention, their pupils constricting, their hearts inexplicably excited, especially many of the cultivators who had failed the assessment and missed the chance to join the Xiaoyao Sect.</p><p></p><p>They couldn't wait to see the Xiaoyao Sect embarrassed!</p><p></p><p>At first, when they saw the Xiaoyao Sect treating them well, they were all excited and wanted to join the Xiaoyao Sect.</p><p></p><p>But after being washed out, their hearts became unbalanced, and they wanted to see the ugliness of the Xiaoyao Sect.</p><p></p><p>"Sss, that seems to be the Grand Elder Chen He of the Huoyan Hall..."</p><p></p><p>"The other elder should be the Grand Elder Zheng Shan of the Sengluo Gate, right?"</p><p></p><p>"Hehe, it seems that the Xiaoyao Sect has been too prosperous lately, affecting the interests of the major sects. This is to discipline the Xiaoyao Sect."</p><p></p><p>"......"</p><p></p><p>Countless queuing assessment disciples frantically transmitted voice messages to each other, making way, their eyes flickering as they remained silent.</p><p></p><p>This scene, Zhu Xingqiu on the high platform seemed to have not seen it at all,</p><p></p><p>The many examiners in the assessment venue also seemed to have not seen it, and continued to carry out the assessment in an orderly manner.</p><p></p><p>Suddenly, the atmosphere of the entire venue became a bit eerie.</p><p></p><p>The people of the Huoyan Hall and Sengluo Gate were slightly taken aback, and their expressions soon turned ugly.</p><p></p><p>The Xiaoyao Sect completely ignored them.</p><p></p><p>What a big tune!</p><p></p><p>Chen He and Zheng Shan exchanged a gloomy look.</p><p></p><p>Chen He took a step forward, looking at the obviously dominant Zhu Xingqiu on the high platform, and said with a strange smile, "We of the Huoyan Hall and Sengluo Gate have come to visit, but you have ignored us. Is this the hospitality of your Xiaoyao Sect?"</p><p></p><p>Zhu Xingqiu was still looking at the assessment venue, without any intention to speak, not even bothering to look at them...</p><p></p><p>Ridiculous!</p><p></p><p>He, a person about to be promoted to Immortal Saint, what was there to say to these two mere Golden Immortal Realm elders?</p><p></p><p>There was a huge realm difference between them!</p><p></p><p>That's right, he admitted that he looked down on these two!</p><p></p><p>The other few executives in the assessment venue also closed their eyes and sat in meditation, with an indifferent air.</p><p></p><p>Seeing this, the Xiaoyao Sect disciples smiled knowingly, they were very clear about the thoughts of Elder Xingqiu and the few executives.</p><p></p><p>Immediately, one of the Xiaoyao Sect disciples stepped forward, first bowing to Zhu Xingqiu,</p><p></p><p>Then turned to face the slightly taken aback Huoyan Hall and Sengluo Gate crowd and smiled, "Hospitality? When have we of the Xiaoyao Sect ever invited you Huoyan Hall and Sengluo Gate? It is you elders who came uninvited on the day we were recruiting disciples in the Xiaoyao Sect, isn't that a bit impolite?"</p><p></p><p>Here is the full English translation of the Chinese excerpt:</p><p></p><p>This statement made the several attendants of Zhu Xingqiu nod silently in agreement. They felt that what was said was correct.</p><p></p><p>At the same time, the gaze of countless cultivators grew increasingly strange, and they were shocked. They did not understand what the Xiaoyao Sect meant, and were surprised that one of its disciples was actually conversing with the two great elders of the Huoyan Hall and the Sengluo Gate.</p><p></p><p>This... was simply too disrespectful.</p><p></p><p>Indeed.</p><p></p><p>After the initial shock, Chen He and Zheng Shan's faces turned so black that ink could have been wrung out of them!! </p><p></p><p>The many elders behind them also felt a tightness in their hearts.</p><p></p><p>After all, they were figures who had been domineering in this southern part of the Canglan Continent. But today...</p><p></p><p>However, the more this was the case, the more Chen He and Zheng Shan dared not act rashly.</p><p></p><p>There was no denying that they felt a sense of awe!</p><p></p><p>"Great Elder, I can't hold back anymore, we have to punish them!" </p><p></p><p>"Yes, with so many cultivators watching, if we don't do something, the reputations of our Huoyan Hall and Sengluo Gate will be ruined!"</p><p></p><p>"......"</p><p></p><p>The group of elders behind them transmitted voice messages to each other, their tones revealing anxiety and impatience.</p><p></p><p>"Shut up!" Chen He suddenly transmitted a voice message, interrupting them. He felt a splitting headache.</p><p></p><p>He and Zheng Shan had reached the positions of the great elders of the Huoyan Hall and Sengluo Gate, and they were definitely not reckless fools!</p><p></p><p>Chen He took a deep breath, not looking at the young disciple, but instead giving Zhu Xingqiu a faint smile: "Our uninvited arrival was indeed presumptuous, but this Elder, don't you manage the disciples of your sect? Isn't this a bit arrogant..."</p><p></p><p>Upon hearing this, many cultivators were astonished, some finding it hard to believe. The assessment had also slowed down a bit at this moment.</p><p></p><p>They never imagined that this could be tolerated?</p><p></p><p>Normally, the Huoyan Hall and Sengluo Gate were so fierce, right?</p><p></p><p>Even the expression of Zhu Xinghe on the high platform flickered for a moment. He hadn't expected it to turn out this way.</p><p></p><p>If the other party had angrily attacked just now, he had even thought about conveniently destroying them...</p><p></p><p>But with so many disciples watching here, he couldn't just casually kill people, as that would definitely impact the reputation of the Xiaoyao Sect.</p><p></p><p>The main thing was that he also couldn't gauge the Sect Master's attitude towards reputation and such matters. If the Sect Master didn't care, then he wouldn't need to consider so many things.</p><p></p><p>Zhu Xingqiu finally turned his gaze towards Chen He and the others.</p><p></p><p>Under this gaze, the pupils of Chen He and the others shrank, and their bodies felt chilled!</p><p></p><p>The Xiaoyao Sect was indeed not simple!!</p><p></p><p>"If you wish to visit, come another day, I have no time today," Zhu Xingqiu said indifferently.</p><p></p><p>Originally, everyone thought Chen He and the others might say something else, but who would have known...</p><p></p><p>"Farewell!"</p><p></p><p>Chen He and the others cupped their hands in salute and disappeared swiftly, very deftly!</p><p></p><p>"Continue the assessment," Zhu Xingqiu closed his eyes and said.</p><p></p><p>His aura could be said to be perfectly maintained.</p><p></p><p>"Yes."</p><p></p><p>Afterwards, the assessment continued, and many failed cultivators, knowing there was no hope, left one after another, as staying here would be useless and they would be driven away.</p><p></p><p>However, they knew that the reputations of the Huoyan Hall and Sengluo Gate had been greatly damaged today.</p><p></p><p>At the same time, in the Xiaoyao Sect, on the rear mountain,</p><p></p><p>Lu Changsheng naturally knew everything that had happened in the outside world, but he hadn't paid much attention to it.</p><p></p><p>Suddenly, his gaze flickered, and he intercepted a transmission message heading towards the Huoyan Hall in the distant void.</p><p></p><p>"The Millennium Sect Competition held once every ten thousand years in the Linglong Heavens? Only sects of at least the Ninth Rank can participate?"</p><p></p><p>Lu Changsheng's eyes brightened, and he called out, "Peng Fang."</p><p></p><p>In no time, Peng Fang hurriedly appeared outside the pavilion and bowed, "Sect Master."</p><p></p><p>Lu Changsheng smiled and said, "There is a matter, go take care of it."</p>

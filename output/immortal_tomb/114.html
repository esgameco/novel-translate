        <h1>Chapter 114</h1>
        <div class="content">
            <p>Here is the full English translation of the Chinese excerpt:</p><p></p><p>The Immortal Emperor's Immortal Continent, the Heavenly Mechanism Pavilion. 99shuix.com</p><p></p><p>Long Sheng and the old turtle followed Nangong Jing to the Heavenly Mechanism Profound Mirror in the rear mountain monastery.</p><p></p><p>A group of Pavilion Elders closely followed behind.</p><p></p><p>The Heavenly Mechanism Profound Mirror was embedded in the mottled mountain wall. Aside from being a bit larger, it was no different from an ordinary bronze mirror, at least on the surface.</p><p></p><p>"Immortal Emperor."</p><p></p><p>Nangong Jing tilted his head and looked at Long Sheng, bowing slightly.</p><p></p><p>Long Sheng clasped his hands behind his back, looking at the Heavenly Mechanism Profound Mirror, and commanded, "Begin."</p><p></p><p>Nangong Jing nodded, then untied the black silk sash, revealing his pitch-black eye sockets.</p><p></p><p>He directed his black gaze towards the Heavenly Mechanism Profound Mirror, silently chanting obscure incantations.</p><p></p><p>The previously quiet bronze mirror suddenly flashed with dazzling white light at this moment.</p><p></p><p>This white light was exceptionally glaring, to the point that even the group of Heavenly Mechanism Pavilion Elders couldn't help but squint their eyes slightly.</p><p></p><p>The white light gradually subsided, and Nangong Jing retied the black sash.</p><p></p><p>And at this time, an image finally appeared on the Heavenly Mechanism Profound Mirror...</p><p></p><p>Dilapidated buildings, withered mountains and fields, desolate land, a lifeless void - the scene was chilling.</p><p></p><p><tt_keyword_ad data-title="Daily Necessities" data-tag="Premium Recommendations" data-type="1" data-value="1933"></tt_keyword_ad></p><p></p><p>Indistinct black shadows like the sea, surging between heaven and earth, wherever they passed, all living beings were in agony.</p><p></p><p>Agonizing cries, prayers, and howls echoed through the heavens.</p><p></p><p>Permeating everything was a sense of despair.</p><p></p><p>At this moment, the Heavenly Mechanism Profound Mirror abruptly stopped, the image very brief.</p><p></p><p>Silence fell upon the place.</p><p></p><p>The old turtle's gaze flickered, such an apocalyptic scene - if he hadn't misunderstood, those geographical environments were undoubtedly happening in the Five Great Immortal Realms.</p><p></p><p>So, this was indeed an impending event.</p><p></p><p>It's just that those indistinct black shadows seemed somewhat familiar to him...</p><p></p><p>The group of Heavenly Mechanism Pavilion Elders stood dumbfounded. They had heard Nangong Jing say that the situation was grave, but they didn't expect it to be this serious.</p><p></p><p>Nangong Jing tilted his head and looked at Long Sheng, only to see his expressionless face. He then sighed lightly and said somewhat embarrassedly, "Immortal Emperor, please forgive me. This is the limit of what Nangong can reconstruct after the divination. However, the Ancestral Heavenly Divine Realm..."</p><p></p><p>Long Sheng waved his hand slightly, interrupting him, then his gaze flickered as he said, "You want to say that the Ancestral Heavenly Divine Realm is like a tiger swallowing a wolf, right?"</p><p></p><p>Nangong Jing was taken aback, then nodded respectfully. The Immortal Emperor Long Sheng truly lived up to his reputation as the most mysterious of the Immortal Emperors in the Four Directions Immortal Realms - he had already known what Nangong was about to say.</p><p></p><p>He then sighed, "Immortal Emperor, the heartbreaking scene in the image is what Nangong has divined, but the specific time of the outbreak, Nangong's lifespan is not enough to divine further."</p><p></p><p>"No matter, then we shall wait." Long Sheng suddenly turned around and asked, "Do you know what those black shadows in the Heavenly Mechanism Profound Vision were?"</p><p></p><p>The Elders looked at each other and shook their heads one by one. How would they know?</p><p></p><p>It was the old turtle who furrowed his brow, his old eyes flickering, as if he was trying hard to remember something.</p><p></p><p>Seeing this, Long Sheng said softly, "The black shadows in the vision just now were the Yuhun Demon Tribe."</p><p></p><p>The Yuhun Demon Tribe? The Elders frowned upon hearing this, as they had never heard of it before.</p><p></p><p>The Yuhun Demon Tribe! The old turtle finally had a moment of enlightenment, his gaze unusually grave...</p><p></p><p>"Immortal Emperor is well-versed, those black shadows are indeed the Yuhun Demon Tribe," Nangong Jing praised.</p><p></p><p>"Uh, Pavilion Master, what is the Yuhun Demon Tribe?" </p><p></p><p>The Elders carefully glanced at Long Sheng, then looked at Nangong Jing with a thirst for knowledge, waiting for him to explain.</p><p></p><p>Nangong Jing looked towards Long Sheng, "Immortal Emperor..."</p><p></p><p>"Go on and explain," Long Sheng said with a smile.</p><p></p><p>Nangong Jing complied, then gestured towards the resting area in the monastery, "Immortal Emperor, please follow me."</p><p></p><p>Long Sheng calmly walked over.</p><p></p><p>Here is the full English translation of the Chinese excerpt:</p><p></p><p>"The boundless and endless Immortal Realms, the Five Great Immortal Realms are merely divisions within the known territories. Take the Southern Immortal Realm we are in now - the Soaring Yang, Chaotic Stars, and Imperial Martial Immortal Continents, as well as the Immortal Emperor Palace, are the entirety of the Southern Immortal Realm. But what lies beyond? The regions beyond are filled with mystery and the unknown..."</p><p></p><p>Nangong Jing paced back and forth, sighing.</p><p></p><p>In the Dao Sanctuary, Lu Changsheng sat on a stone bench, with the Old Turtle standing behind him, and the elders of the Heavenly Mechanism Pavilion kneeling in a row, listening attentively.</p><p></p><p>With the Immortal Emperor present, they dared not sit.</p><p></p><p>"And that Yin-Ming Demonic Tribe... is a mysterious race that exists outside the Five Great Immortal Realms!" Nangong Jing said solemnly.</p><p></p><p>The Heavenly Mechanism Pavilion elders nodded grimly.</p><p></p><p>They knew well that the Four Directions Immortal Realms did not equate to the Five Great Immortal Realms - the former was a general term for the entire spatial domain, while the latter specifically referred to the Eastern, Southern, Western, Northern, and Central Immortal Realms.</p><p></p><p>"In my divination, I only know that the Yin-Ming Demonic Tribe is extremely powerful, their civilization level no less than, or even surpassing, the Five Great Immortal Realms. I don't know what methods the people of the Ancestral Heavenly Realm used to incite the Yin-Ming Demonic Tribe to attack our Five Great Immortal Realms," Nangong Jing shook his head and sighed.</p><p></p><p>Hiss!</p><p></p><p>The Heavenly Mechanism Pavilion elders exchanged glances, their expressions filled with dread.</p><p></p><p>Surpassing them? That terrifying?</p><p></p><p>But when they recalled the scene of devastation in the Heavenly Mechanism Profound Realm, they were somewhat convinced.</p><p></p><p>"Immortal Emperor, this is all Nangong knows. As for the Yin-Ming Demonic Tribe's detailed characteristics, combat prowess, and when they will invade, Nangong is unfortunately lacking in knowledge and ability," Nangong Jing looked at Lu Changsheng and bowed apologetically.</p><p></p><p>At this moment, Lu Changsheng waved his hand and stood up, smiling faintly, "Excluding this Emperor, the overall combat power of the Yin-Ming Demonic Tribe is not just surpassing, but far exceeding the Five Great Immortal Realms."</p><p></p><p>The eyes of the crowd widened in shock!</p><p></p><p>Far exceeding?</p><p></p><p>Looking at the stunned Nangong Jing and Heavenly Mechanism Pavilion elders, Lu Changsheng nodded indifferently.</p><p></p><p>He was indeed immortal, having been buried in the Spiritual Dust Realm's Immortal Tomb before taking on the Immortal Emperor position in the Central Immortal Realm for less than ten million years.</p><p></p><p>Before his tenure as Immortal Emperor, he and the Old Turtle had already traveled to some unknown regions of the Four Directions Immortal Realms.</p><p></p><p>According to Lu Changsheng's estimation, the regions they had traveled to were perhaps not even three percent of the entire Four Directions Immortal Realms.</p><p></p><p>Thousands of years ago, when Lu Changsheng and the Old Turtle were traveling, they had already encountered the Yin-Ming Demonic Tribe...</p><p></p><p>At that time, Lu Changsheng was not yet unparalleled in strength, far from his current state after emerging from the Immortal Tomb.</p><p></p><p>Back then, he and the Old Turtle did not gain much advantage when dealing with the Yin-Ming Demonic Tribe.</p><p></p><p>However, there was not much enmity at the time, and he still had some reservations.</p><p></p><p>Hearing Lu Changsheng's words, the Old Turtle nodded solemnly. He had always been with Lu Changsheng and naturally knew the terrifying nature of the Yin-Ming Demonic Tribe - a mysterious and powerful race!</p><p></p><p>Feeling the intense atmosphere, Lu Changsheng chuckled lightly, "Not to mention anything else, the Yin-Ming Demonic Tribe has at least ten existences as powerful as Immortal Emperors. What do you think?"</p><p></p><p>The crowd was utterly horrified!</p><p></p><p>Nangong Jing clenched his fists, trembling with fear and despair at Lu Changsheng's words.</p><p></p><p>With such a gap in top-tier combat power, how could they fight? Wouldn't the Five Great Immortal Realms be doomed to fall, even with the return of the Immortal Emperor Lu Changsheng?</p><p></p><p>The people of the Ancestral Heavenly Realm must have such a malicious intent!</p><p></p><p>"Then... Immortal Emperor, what should we do?" Nangong Jing looked at Lu Changsheng, his voice trembling with hope. Hearing Lu Changsheng's words, he could no longer maintain his composure. In his heart, the mysterious Immortal Emperor Lu Changsheng was now the last straw of salvation, for some inexplicable reason, as an Heavenly Mechanism Master's intuition...</p><p></p><p>Lu Changsheng adjusted his sleeves, smiling mysteriously, "..."</p>

        <h1>Chapter 63</h1>
        <div class="content">
            <p>Here is the full English translation of the Chinese excerpt:</p><p></p><p>The space of Moyu Town was deathly silent. üê≥‚ôî69ùï§ƒ§ùïåÔΩò.ùêúùìû–ºüë∫‚ô¨</p><p></p><p>Countless bound demonic beasts and townspeople looked as if time had been frozen.</p><p></p><p>Tongxin and Lin Dong regained their senses, surveying their surroundings, and couldn't help but swallow hard.</p><p></p><p>Finally, they turned their gaze to Lu Changsheng, filled with reverence.</p><p></p><p>This was a strength they could not comprehend...</p><p></p><p>Was the Immortal Cultivator Lord really that powerful?</p><p></p><p>And to even pull someone back from the brink of self-detonation... it was unbelievable.</p><p></p><p>"Hehe, Crane Forest, that Dragon Bear was right, you really are a lousy good-for-nothing. In this Spiritual Dust Realm, it's fine, but if you were to ascend to the Four Directions Immortal Realm in the future, this kind of personality would be detrimental to you."</p><p></p><p>At this moment, the old turtle manifested on the spot, first bowing to Lu Changsheng, then mockingly laughing.</p><p></p><p>"Sss!" Tongxin and Lin Dong were shocked.</p><p></p><p>Wasn't this hunchbacked old man the powerful one who had addressed him as "Master" three years ago? Unexpectedly, he appeared again today.</p><p></p><p>Ancient Crane Forest bowed and then apologetically lowered his head towards Lu Changsheng.</p><p></p><p>"Sir, every time it's you who has to intervene, Crane Forest feels..."</p><p></p><p>Before he could finish, Lu Changsheng waved his hand to interrupt, saying, "Old Turtle, you handle the rest."</p><p></p><p>As the words fell, a sound of a shackle unlocking seemed to resonate in the void, "Clack."</p><p></p><p>The next moment, all the previously bound demonic beasts and townspeople suddenly sprang back to life, their faces filled with bewilderment, completely unaware of what had just happened.</p><p></p><p>The Great Earth Dragon Bear regained his senses and quickly recalled something, sharply looking at Ancient Crane Forest, then glancing at his abdomen, his pupils contracting as he exclaimed in disbelief, "How is this possible! Weren't you about to self-detonate before?"</p><p></p><p>After all, self-detonation was irreversible. Once it began, it was impossible to stop!</p><p></p><p>How could this be?</p><p></p><p>Ancient Crane Forest remained silent, not responding.</p><p></p><p>"Hmm? Who are you?" </p><p></p><p>At this time, the Great Earth Dragon Bear noticed Lu Changsheng and the old turtle, his gaze sharpening.</p><p></p><p>The old turtle bowed to Lu Changsheng, then slowly walked forward with his hands behind his back, chuckling, "Do you deserve to know?"</p><p></p><p>At this moment, all the demonic beasts and townspeople were watching this scene, their gazes varying.</p><p></p><p>Especially Zhang Cheng from the tavern, the waiter, and the other townspeople who had interacted with Lu Changsheng before - their eyes widened in shock and disbelief.</p><p></p><p>"Isn't that Mr. Lu?... How, how could he be here?"</p><p></p><p>As for Zhang Cheng, he was not as surprised, as he had already known about Lu Changsheng's identity as an Immortal.</p><p></p><p>However, Lu Changsheng's sudden appearance today still shook him.</p><p></p><p>After all, aside from occasionally coming to the tavern to buy peach blossom wine, the Master was rarely seen.</p><p></p><p>The Great Earth Dragon Bear narrowed his eyes, scrutinizing Lu Changsheng and the old turtle, the more he looked, the more his heart raced.</p><p></p><p>Unfathomable! Completely unfathomable!</p><p></p><p>He then spoke in a threatening tone, "What do you mean, sirs? Our Demon Realm is not one to be trifled with easily..."</p><p></p><p>"Whether to be trifled with or not, it doesn't matter." The old turtle sneered.</p><p></p><p>The next moment, he suddenly reached out his hand!</p><p></p><p>The Great Earth Dragon Bear's entire body lost control, violently hurled towards the old turtle.</p><p></p><p>Finally, he suspended in the air just a foot away from the old turtle.</p><p></p><p>At this time, the Great Earth Dragon Bear's gaze towards the old turtle was filled with terror and horror. His body and demonic aura were sealed, no matter how he struggled, it was futile.</p><p></p><p>"Dragon Bear Demon General!!"</p><p></p><p>Here is the full English translation of the Chinese excerpt:</p><p></p><p>"Good!" </p><p></p><p>The crowd of demonic beasts were stunned for a moment, then they immediately let out shrill roars and frantically climbed up onto their faces.</p><p></p><p>Anyone with clear eyes could see that the Earth Dragon Bear had been easily subdued by that hunchbacked old man!</p><p></p><p>"Good!!"</p><p></p><p>The villagers excitedly raised their fists and cheered wildly, extremely excited, as if a huge weight had been lifted from their hearts! </p><p></p><p>Another powerful immortal had come to save them, they wouldn't have to die!</p><p></p><p>The old turtle furrowed his brow, carefully glanced at Lu Changsheng, then turned his head and sternly shouted, </p><p></p><p>"All of you, shut up!! If you make any more noise to disturb the master, Grandpa Turtle will be the first to tear you insignificant ants to shreds!"</p><p></p><p>This startling roar shook the heavens!</p><p></p><p>The villagers immediately fell silent, trembling in fear from head to toe.</p><p></p><p>Not just them, even the three disciples of Elder Guchelin beside them shuddered inwardly.</p><p></p><p>"Who told you to stand? All you ants kneel before Grandpa Turtle, anyone who dares to stand up will die."</p><p></p><p>The old turtle sneered coldly. </p><p></p><p>This made the Earth Dragon Bear in front of him as well as the many demonic beasts here shudder inwardly. </p><p></p><p>How could this hunchbacked old man be more ferocious than these demonic beasts?</p><p></p><p>Who is the real demon beast here?</p><p></p><p>Instantly,</p><p></p><p>tens of thousands of villagers knelt down in waves, rushing to be the first, afraid that if they were too late they would die.</p><p></p><p>Chen Dadao and the others also didn't dare to be negligent, they all had a deep impression of this formidable hunchbacked old man. </p><p></p><p>They knew he was Lu Changsheng's old servant, who had appeared once three years ago.</p><p></p><p>The old turtle sneered mockingly, then looked towards Lu Changsheng and respectfully said:</p><p></p><p>"Master, how should I deal with these demonic beasts?"</p><p></p><p>"Didn't I tell you to handle it yourself?"</p><p></p><p>Lu Changsheng replied indifferently with his hands behind his back, the very picture of an impartial observer.</p><p></p><p>This exchange was exceptionally clear in the silent scene.</p><p></p><p>All the demonic beasts here, as well as the kneeling villagers, were trembling in their souls...</p><p></p><p>This powerful old man was actually just a servant. </p><p></p><p>Then what kind of abilities and background did his master have?</p><p></p><p>And even more terrifying was,</p><p></p><p>his master, that Mr. Lu, had frequently appeared on the streets of Moyu Town over the past eight years. </p><p></p><p>Many of them had greeted him before.</p><p></p><p>They had always thought he was a scholar or a learned man...</p><p></p><p>But it turned out...</p><p>The gentleman they had often greeted had such a powerful background!</p><p></p><p>Just from his servant, one could see that this Mr. Lu must also be an immortal with extraordinary abilities!</p><p>And he would only grow stronger!</p><p></p><p>Eight years...hidden so deeply...</p><p></p><p>"Hehe, yes, yes, yes." </p><p></p><p>The old turtle laughed awkwardly, then turned to look at the Earth Dragon Bear, the humble attitude in front of Lu Changsheng instantly vanishing, replaced by a lofty and superior one.</p><p></p><p>"You can be on your way."</p><p></p><p>"No, don't kill me... Senior, spare my life!"</p><p></p><p>The Earth Dragon Bear was in desperate panic, instinctively looking towards Lu Changsheng and begging.</p><p></p><p>But at that moment, the old turtle raised his palm and pressed down forcefully!</p><p></p><p>"Bang‚Äî!"</p><p></p><p>The Earth Dragon Bear instantly exploded into a mist of blood.</p><p></p><p>This scene left everyone stunned and speechless.</p><p></p><p>"The dragon demon general is dead, flee! Return to the Demon Realm and report this to the Demon King!"</p><p></p><p>The group of demonic beasts were leaderless, their courage suddenly gone, and in their panic they fled in all directions!</p><p></p><p>"Trying to escape?"</p><p></p><p>The old turtle swept his gaze over the fleeing demonic beasts, sneering coldly inwardly, then suddenly waved his hand!</p><p></p><p>This space was instantly filled with countless intertwined emerald-green light beams, forming a huge cage.</p><p></p><p>The demonic beasts all crashed into it and were bounced back.</p><p></p><p>The old turtle's expression remained calm and indifferent as he lightly waved his fingers.</p><p></p><p>Countless emerald-green light beams shot out like the sharpest blades in the world!</p><p></p><p>Shing shing shing!</p><p></p><p>In the blink of an eye, those numerous demonic beasts were frozen in place, their expressions also frozen.</p><p></p><p>The next moment,</p><p></p><p>the bodies of the demonic beasts suddenly shattered, their flesh and blood falling to the ground in pieces, the cuts unnaturally clean.</p><p></p><p>Only glowing beast cores floated slowly above the scattered corpse fragments.</p><p></p><p>"So, so strong!"</p><p></p><p>The three disciples of Elder Guchelin gulped nervously, their expressions filled with terror.</p>

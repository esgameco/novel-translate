        <h1>Chapter 341</h1>
        <div class="content">
            <p>Here is the full English translation of the Chinese excerpt:</p><p></p><p>"Fellow Daoist, just take a guess, shall we? üéÑüçì‚ùª‚ùæùìº—íÔºµùï©.œÇùï†ùìÇ‚òÆüí¢," Zhou Dafumurmured.</p><p></p><p>Lu Changsheng smiled wryly, "What do you think?"</p><p></p><p>Seeing this, Zhou Dafusuddenly became spirited and enthusiastically said, "In my opinion, Senior Kongzhen will definitely win. After all, he is ranked 10th on the Battle Ranking, and his cultivation has been in the early stage of the Divine Profound Realm for a long time. I've heard that he's just a step away from reaching the middle stage of the Divine Profound Realm."</p><p></p><p>"As for Senior Miu Fan, although his cultivation is also at the Divine Profound Realm, he is a late bloomer who has just recently entered the Divine Profound Realm. His foundation and roots are probably not as strong as Senior Kongzhen's."</p><p></p><p>"Moreover, at this moment, Senior Miu Fan is in a perilous situation, and I estimate that his defeat is only a matter of time."</p><p></p><p>Lu Changsheng chuckled upon hearing this, "You've analyzed it so thoroughly, so why did you ask me?"</p><p></p><p>"Hehe, there's still a chance of an upset, what I said is common knowledge," Zhou Dafusaid, slightly embarrassed.</p><p></p><p>Zhou Dafudid not realize that in front of Lu Changsheng, he couldn't help but have a sense of pleasing him.</p><p></p><p>"Then I'll guess that Miu Fan will win," Lu Changsheng said indifferently.</p><p></p><p>Ah?</p><p></p><p>Not only was Zhou Dafustunned, but even the cultivators nearby who had heard it were also stunned.</p><p></p><p>They were first shocked, and then relieved.</p><p></p><p>After all, since there was no bet, this person was just speaking nonsense.</p><p></p><p>"Hehe, Fellow Daoist, dare you make a bet?" </p><p></p><p>"Yes, how about a bet? Otherwise, anyone can just talk empty words."</p><p></p><p>"......"</p><p></p><p>At this time, a few people smiled and asked Lu Changsheng, their eyes looking at him as if he was a fat sheep.</p><p></p><p>Zhou Dafu's expression changed slightly, and he looked at Lu Changsheng with concern.</p><p></p><p>As for Lu Changsheng, he remained expressionless and ignored them.</p><p></p><p>Seeing this, those few people laughed and mocked, "Since you don't dare, then keep quiet and don't try to gain attention."</p><p></p><p>"That's right, Senior Kongzhen is ranked in the top 10 of the Battle Ranking, how can you slander him like this?"</p><p></p><p>"......"</p><p></p><p>Hearing this, Lu Changsheng's brow furrowed slightly. What did he slander?</p><p></p><p>Zhou Dafuwas a bit anxious. He could see that these people were hardcore fans of Kongzhen, and they might have even placed bets on Kongzhen winning, so they naturally didn't like the blue-robed Daoist saying that.</p><p></p><p>At this time, a few people on the other side couldn't stand it anymore. They were very admiring of Senior Miu Fan, so they shouted:</p><p></p><p>"Tsk! I feel that this blue-robed Daoist is right. Kongzhen is strong, but Miu Fan may not necessarily lose!"</p><p></p><p>"That's right, you guys are being too aggressive. He just said that Miu Fan might win, is that not allowed?"</p><p></p><p>"What, can't we express our own personal opinions?"</p><p></p><p>"......"</p><p></p><p>The two groups immediately started arguing.</p><p></p><p>"You all shut up, don't say anything unnecessary. I just ask one thing, dare you make a bet? If you're a real man, then bet!"</p><p></p><p>Suddenly, the few cultivators who had spoken up for Lu Changsheng shut their mouths.</p><p></p><p>Although they were unwilling, they weren't fools either. If they bet on Miu Fan winning, they would probably just be throwing their money away.</p><p></p><p>"Alright, then I'll make a bet with you all." </p><p></p><p>Lu Changsheng suddenly turned his head and said to those people.</p><p></p><p>"Fellow Daoist..." Zhou Dafuwas anxious, he didn't want Lu Changsheng to be taken advantage of.</p><p></p><p>And the few cultivators who had spoken up for Lu Changsheng were also stunned. They didn't expect this blue-robed Daoist to be such a hardcore fan of Senior Miu Fan. At the same time, they felt ashamed, realizing that they were more timid compared to this blue-robed Daoist.</p><p></p><p>Those people were obviously taken aback, but then they smiled gleefully. It seems this person was angered and embarrassed, but they didn't mind. A fattened sheep coming to them, there was no reason not to...</p><p></p><p>Here is the full English translation of the Chinese excerpt:</p><p></p><p>"How much spiritual crystal are you betting? If it's not enough, it won't be fun!" someone shouted at Lu Changsheng.</p><p></p><p>Lu Changsheng had a hint of a smile in his eyes: "Betting spiritual crystals is not fun. How about we bet something else?"</p><p></p><p>Something else? Interesting...</p><p></p><p>One of them joked, "Go ahead, tell us what you want to bet. Anything goes, hehe."</p><p></p><p>Lu Changsheng said softly, "Then let's just bet casually, let's bet our lives. If Miu Fan loses, you can do whatever you want with me. But if Kong Zhen loses, you shall perish before me. How's that?"</p><p></p><p>...</p><p></p><p>Not only were Zhou Dafu and the others dumbfounded, even many of the cultivators attracted by this place were greatly intimidated as they looked at Lu Changsheng.</p><p></p><p>A ruthless person!</p><p></p><p>What do you mean "just bet casually"?</p><p></p><p>At this moment, those few cultivators also had their expressions change slightly. They didn't expect this azure-robed cultivator to be so ruthless. To be honest, they were a bit scared, even though Senior Kong Zhen's victory seemed assured. </p><p></p><p>After all, better safe than sorry.</p><p></p><p>"What? Are you too afraid?" Lu Changsheng smiled.</p><p></p><p>Seeing the smile on Lu Changsheng's face, the few of them felt as if countless ants were crawling on their bodies. Aware of the gazes around them, their faces flushed red.</p><p></p><p>"Bet our lives? We're not afraid!" </p><p></p><p>"That's right, since Senior Kong Zhen is sure to win, if you want to die, then we'll oblige you!"</p><p></p><p>...</p><p></p><p>Lu Changsheng looked at the five of them and smiled, "Then it's settled."</p><p></p><p>After that, everyone fell silent and focused on watching the battle.</p><p></p><p>Zhou Dafu's face was pale, and he kept glancing at Lu Changsheng, wanting to say something but holding back.</p><p></p><p>At this time, on the battle stage, dazzling lights flashed, and the continuous sounds of wind breaking and explosions resounded in everyone's ears.</p><p></p><p>Miu Fan was completely suppressed by Kong Zhen, and the sight of this excited those five who had bet on Kong Zhen's victory. They couldn't help but taunt Lu Changsheng, as if saying, "Go ahead and die."</p><p></p><p>But when they saw that Lu Changsheng's face showed no trace of panic and he still had a calm smile, they couldn't help but feel a slight tremor in their hearts.</p><p></p><p>"Boom!!"</p><p></p><p>At this moment, Miu Fan on the battle stage suddenly erupted with a powerful aura, sweeping across the square!</p><p></p><p>Kong Zhen's expression changed drastically as he roared in disbelief, "Mid-Spirit Profound realm?! Impossible! Miu Fan, I never expected you to have hidden your true strength so deeply!"</p><p></p><p>"Haha, Kong Zhen, I was just playing with you earlier. If I didn't have full confidence, do you think I, Miu Fan, would challenge you today?" Miu Fan laughed wildly.</p><p></p><p>What? Mid-Spirit Profound realm?!</p><p></p><p>The square immediately became restless!</p><p></p><p>As for the five who had bet with Lu Changsheng, their faces had turned deathly pale, and they stared blankly at Lu Changsheng.</p><p></p><p>As for Lu Changsheng, he remained unfazed, having already seen through Miu Fan's deliberate concealment of his strength.</p><p></p><p>Since these five had spoken rudely and pestered him, it was time to show them some color.</p><p></p><p>Even sages have a touch of fiery temper.</p><p></p><p>Zhou Dafu looked at the azure-robed Lu Changsheng in shock, his eyes flickering wildly. In a situation where everyone thought Miu Fan would lose, this fellow cultivator had dared to say that Miu Fan could win, and with their lives as the bet... This was truly terrifying.</p><p></p><p>"Haha, Kong Zhen? Are you not going to leave? Do you want me to personally send you down?" Miu Fan laughed loudly on the battle stage, as his frenzied cultivation and inner refinement had all been for this moment.</p><p></p><p>"Hmph, I concede, Miu Fan. Rank 10 on the battle rankings... I, Kong Zhen, will reclaim it one day!" Kong Zhen said angrily.</p><p></p><p>"Good, I'll be waiting for you!" </p><p></p><p>At the same time, Lu Changsheng looked at the five people and had a gentle smile on his lips:</p><p></p><p>"You may now depart."</p>

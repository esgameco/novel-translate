        <h1>Chapter 465</h1>
        <div class="content">
            <p>Here is the full English translation of the Chinese excerpt:</p><p></p><p>Ye Zhuiyue first looked a bit flustered at the fierce battle ahead, seeing the fighting was in complete chaos, and no one was paying attention to his Ye Clan, so he relaxed a little.</p><p></p><p>He then quickly looked at Lu Changsheng, suspiciously asking, "Elder Lu, what is this..."</p><p></p><p>Lu Changsheng did not say much, only saying, "Your Ye Clan should not rush to act for now, just observe for the time being."</p><p></p><p>Ye Zhuiyue felt his brain itching, his face full of astonishment: "Why, why?"</p><p></p><p>"It's up to you. If you trust me, just do as I say."</p><p></p><p>Lu Changsheng glanced at him and then walked to the side, taking out some fruits and tossing them into his mouth, watching the battlefield like an indifferent bystander.</p><p></p><p>Ye Zhuiyue's eyes flickered, his expression conflicted. After staring at the calm Lu Changsheng for a while, he made a decision and sent a voice transmission to Ye Nantian.</p><p></p><p>Hearing the voice transmission, Ye Nantian's expression became strange, but of course, he dared not disobey the order of the ancestor, so he issued the order.</p><p></p><p>After receiving the order, the members of the Ye Clan gave Elder Lu a meaningful look, thinking that Lu Changsheng was really... Indeed, in the chaos of the battle, no one would notice them slacking off for a while.</p><p></p><p>Soon, the entire Ye Clan stood aside with Lu Changsheng, staring intently at the earth-shattering battle in front of them, as if it had nothing to do with them.</p><p></p><p>"Cough, big brother, is this Elder Lu's intention?" Ye Zhuixing came to Ye Zhuiyue's side and coughed dryly to ask.</p><p></p><p>"Mm." Ye Zhuiyue nodded.</p><p></p><p>Ye Zhuixing asked suspiciously, "What does Elder Lu mean?"</p><p></p><p>"Elder Lu didn't say, but I can feel that there must be some hidden reason..." Ye Zhuiyue's eyes flickered.</p><p></p><p>Ye Zhuixing pursed his lips, unable to help but look at the blue-robed man eating fruits as if he was at his own home, and whispered, "Big brother, I don't know why, but I'm starting to feel that Elder Lu is not simple at all..."</p><p></p><p>Ye Zhuiyue did not speak again. In any case, although this tactic was a bit of a slacker, it could greatly reduce the casualties of the Ye Clan for the time being, so why not?</p><p></p><p>Boom!!!</p><p></p><p>The battle here was gradually reaching a climax!</p><p></p><p>Every moment, countless people were falling!</p><p></p><p>The bloody scent in the heaven and earth was becoming more and more dense, and the blood mist in front of them could be clearly seen!</p><p></p><p>The most intense part of the battle was between the ancestor-level figures of the two super ancient clans, Hong Wanjun and Ouyang Mo!</p><p></p><p>Without any exaggeration, most of the casualties here were caused by the aftershocks of their battle!</p><p></p><p>The battle at the Divine Void Realm, even the aftershocks, was terrifyingly powerful, and more importantly, the two of them had not even used their full strength yet.</p><p></p><p>At this moment, Ouyang Mo turned his head and glanced at the direction of the He Clan, then turned to look at Hong Wanjun with a bloodthirsty smile:</p><p></p><p>"Hong Wanjun, what's the point of this mutual exploration? The Divine Void Realm has already vaguely grasped a glimpse of the Dao, why don't we directly clash in the Dao?"</p><p></p><p>"Come, old man will not let you win!" Hong Wanjun glared.</p><p></p><p>At the same time, on the Ye Clan side, Ye Zhuiyue murmured longingly, "The Dao... Today, I actually have the chance to witness the clash of the Dao."</p><p></p><p>Ye Zhuixing became curious and asked, "Big brother, what is the Dao? Is it very powerful?"</p><p></p><p>Ye Zhuiyue sighed, "Zhuixing, you may not know that the Divine Void Realm is called the true watershed. Apart from the longevity of a hundred million years, the most important thing is that they have already grasped a glimpse of the power of the Dao!"</p><p></p><p>"Just a glimpse of the power of the Dao is so powerful?" Ye Zhuixing exclaimed.</p><p></p><p>Ye Zhuiyue smiled, "Of course, my brother is almost at the Divine Void Realm, and it is also because he has grasped the power of the Dao, though it is only a tiny, tiny bit, far less than the true Divine Void Realm experts."</p><p></p><p>Ye Zhuixing nodded thoughtfully, then focused his attention on the battle.</p><p></p><p>On the side, Lu Changsheng, upon hearing this, had an expressionless face.</p><p></p><p>The Dao, the bridge connecting reality and the supreme Dao of heaven and earth, but...</p><p></p><p>A tiny bit of the Dao, what is that? Even the true Dao is nothing in his eyes, at most it is at the Void Realm.</p><p></p><p>After all, above the Dao, there is still the Profound Principle, which is a higher bridge than the Dao.</p><p></p><p>And above the Profound Principle, there is the Order, which already belongs to a realm beyond the Void Realm, able to give birth to all things.</p><p></p><p>Suddenly, Lu Changsheng's eyes widened!</p><p></p><p>How did he know this information so clearly... How did he know all this...Strange.</p><p></p><p>Here is my translation of the Chinese excerpt:</p><p></p><p>Ouyang Mo let out a cold laugh, forming a hand seal and silently channeling the faint power of the laws within his body.</p><p></p><p>Above Ouyang Mo's head, a thin mist began to rise, as if a hidden energy was connecting him to the heavens and earth.</p><p></p><p>Immediately after, Ouyang Mo released the hand seal, closing his eyes and tilting his head back slightly, spreading his hands to the sides.</p><p></p><p>Rumble, rumble!</p><p></p><p>The sky suddenly became overcast with dense clouds, lightning flashing.</p><p></p><p>Ouyang Mo's mouth curved into a cruel smile: "The law of rain, corrosive rain!"</p><p></p><p>Suddenly, for thousands of miles around, a drizzling rain began to fall from the sky...</p><p></p><p>Any living beings soaked by the rainwater were quickly dissolved into bloody mist!</p><p></p><p>All the rainwater that fell seemed to be under Ouyang Mo's control, only drenching the ancient clan forces on the Hung side.</p><p></p><p>Soon, the weaker ones began to let out agonizing screams, their bodies starting to melt.</p><p></p><p>During this time, only cultivators at the Divine Spirit Realm and above could barely withstand it, but it was not a long-term solution, as the corrosion was just a matter of time. It was clear that Ouyang Mo had deliberately targeted those below the Divine Spirit Realm, or else the power would not have been so weak.</p><p></p><p>This scene sent shivers down everyone's backs!</p><p></p><p>Eerie, so eerie was this rain!</p><p></p><p>The young disciples of the Leaf Clan stared in awe, only reacting with shock when they realized they were unharmed, the strange rain not having touched them.</p><p></p><p>The young Leaf Clan disciples hurriedly cast grateful and awe-filled glances at Leaf Zhui Yue, thankful that the ancestor was there.</p><p></p><p>Why were they all looking at him? Leaf Zhui Yue was completely bewildered, as he had done nothing.</p><p></p><p>How could he possibly have the ability to protect all the clan's disciples from this rain infused with the power of the laws?</p><p></p><p>What was going on?</p><p></p><p>"Ouyang Mo, so your law is rain, able to cover thousands of miles. It seems your cultivation is not complete..." </p><p></p><p>Hung Wan Jun let out a cold laugh, a flash of urgency in his eyes, as he could not afford to delay, for his side was losing people by the moment. But just as he was about to unleash his own law...</p><p></p><p>The rain suddenly stopped!</p><p></p><p>Ouyang Mo waved his hand and shouted, "Hung Wan Jun is about to use his techniques, all of you retreat into the He Clan!"</p><p></p><p>With that, he led the ancient clan forces back into the He Clan, quickly disappearing from the sight of Hung Wan Jun and the others.</p><p></p><p>????</p><p></p><p>This scene left everyone dumbfounded, could it really be played like this?</p><p></p><p>"Hahaha! The ancestor's cultivation is unparalleled, he hasn't even used his techniques yet and has already scared Ouyang the Ancestor shitless! Wu Yue is in awe!"</p><p></p><p>At this moment, Hong Wu Yue's eyes flashed with a sinister light as he hurriedly flattered.</p><p></p><p>Immediately, many of the ancient clan members followed suit and began to flatter as well.</p><p></p><p>"Hmph, Ouyang Mo is nothing but that," Hung Wan Jun said with a satisfied smile.</p><p></p><p>Seeing this, Hong Wu Yue's eyes gleamed with a dark light as he quickly said, "Ancestor, let's take the opportunity to infiltrate the He Clan and block their ancestor's refinement!"</p><p></p><p>"Good! All of you follow me to charge into the He Clan!!" Hung Wan Jun suddenly waved his hand and shouted.</p><p></p><p>Immediately, the crowd, regardless of the countless dead and injured, surged towards the He Clan in a grand manner.</p><p></p><p>"Elder Luo, we..."</p><p></p><p>This time, Leaf Zhui Yue wisely directly asked Elder Luo Changsheng's opinion.</p><p></p><p>Luo Changsheng's gaze was calm, sweeping over the empty ground littered with corpses and blood with deep meaning. "The main act has begun."</p><p></p><p>Huh?</p><p></p><p>Leaf Zhui Yue and the others were perplexed, not understanding.</p><p></p><p>"You'll know once you go in." Luo Changsheng suddenly smiled kindly at them.</p><p></p><p>Seeing that Luo Changsheng no longer objected, Leaf Zhui Yue nodded and ordered Leaf Nantian to lead the Leaf Clan disciples to make a final reconnaissance into the He Clan!</p><p></p><p>Luo Changsheng also followed behind leisurely.</p><p></p><p>And just as everyone entered the He Clan...</p><p></p><p>In the Sky Pavilion, the black-robed man coldly smiled at the panicked and bewildered He Lian: "You can now activate the Heavenly Screen Formation..."</p><p></p><p>He Lian's expression was anxious and utterly confused: "Star Master, but they have already charged in, how could it be, how could Ouyang Mo and the others not be able to stop Hung Wan Jun?!"</p><p></p><p>Boom!</p><p></p><p>The black-robed man suddenly appeared in front of He Lian, ruthlessly grabbing her throat and lifting her high up, coldly saying, "I told you to activate the Heavenly Screen Formation, do you not understand?"</p><p></p><p>He Lian's face turned deathly pale, and she hurriedly transmitted a message to the clan elders:</p><p></p><p>"Activate... the formation!!!"</p><p></p><p>Hum hum hum—</p><p></p><p>In the next moment, countless blood-red light beams intertwined throughout the entire He Clan, painting the sky with a sea of blood light!!</p>

        <h1>Chapter 450</h1>
        <div class="content">
            <p>Here is the full English translation of the Chinese excerpt:</p><p></p><p>In the Cangwu Pavilion, Lu Changsheng would occasionally stop and take down some strangely named cultivation techniques from the antique shelves to take a look.</p><p></p><p>However, he would usually just take a glance and then put them back on the shelf.</p><p></p><p>Cultivation techniques are multifarious and encompassing, with cultivators relying on spiritual energy, divine elements, or mysterious spiritual forces to activate them.</p><p></p><p>As for cultivation techniques, Lu Changsheng rarely used them. For his level, cultivation techniques were more form than substance.</p><p></p><p>Far more effective were a single sword strike, a single word, or even a single gaze.</p><p></p><p>At the same time, many of the young members of the Ye Clan curiously watched this unfamiliar young man in blue robes, clearly not one of their own.</p><p></p><p>"Hmm, who is this person? He doesn't seem to be from our Ye Clan, and yet he has managed to reach the third floor of the Cangwu Pavilion. How did he get up here?"</p><p></p><p>"Indeed, the third floor is an extremely important place. Not even our own Ye Clan disciples whose cultivation has not reached the Divine Warrior Realm are qualified to come up here."</p><p></p><p>"Shall we go ask him?"</p><p></p><p>"Nah, let's not bother. He must have gotten the Pavilion Elder's permission to be here, otherwise it wouldn't be possible."</p><p></p><p>"But that's not necessarily true, the Pavilion Elder is always napping, sometimes he may overlook things."</p><p></p><p>"......"</p><p></p><p>Soon, a Ye Clan disciple approached Lu Changsheng and asked sternly, "You are not one of us Ye Clan, so how did you get up to this third floor? Was it with the Pavilion Elder's permission?"</p><p></p><p>Lu Changsheng seemed to not have heard, putting down the scroll of techniques in his hand, and then to the astonishment of all, proceeded to head towards the fourth floor.</p><p></p><p>What was he trying to do? Not satisfied with just the third floor, he wanted to ascend to the fourth floor as well?</p><p></p><p>The fourth floor was protected by restrictions that required two conditions to pass: first, reaching the Divine Spirit Realm in cultivation, and second, possessing Ye Clan bloodline.</p><p></p><p>Otherwise, any unauthorized intruder would be instantly annihilated by the restrictions!</p><p></p><p>"Wait, wait!!" </p><p></p><p>A Ye Clan disciple, unable to bear it, hurriedly tried to stop him.</p><p></p><p>But the next moment, when Lu Changsheng effortlessly passed through the restrictions as if they were nothing, and disappeared into the fourth floor, the Ye Clan disciples were petrified!</p><p></p><p>Impossible, absolutely impossible!</p><p></p><p>"It seems this person must be one of our own Ye Clan, otherwise he wouldn't have been able to ascend to the fourth floor so smoothly!"</p><p></p><p>"I reckon he must be a recent returnee to the clan. His cultivation is truly formidable, actually reaching the Divine Spirit Realm! Far surpassing the rest of us."</p><p></p><p>"Indeed... To be able to cultivate to this level without relying on the clan's resources, he must be an extraordinary individual."</p><p></p><p>.........</p><p></p><p>"Clan Leader!"</p><p></p><p>"Clan Leader!"</p><p></p><p>Outside the Cangwu Pavilion, many disciples hurriedly saluted as they saw Ye Nantian. </p><p></p><p>Ye Nantian paid them no mind, quickly entering the Cangwu Pavilion with Ye Xunmang, soon spotting Ye Zhuixing reclining on a chair, with Ye Feng by his side.</p><p></p><p>"Clan Leader," Ye Feng hurriedly bowed.</p><p></p><p>"Hmm? What brings you to the Cangwu Pavilion?" The reclining Ye Zhuixing opened his eyes to glance at Ye Nantian.</p><p></p><p>"Pavilion Elder, that senior Lu is still within the Cangwu Pavilion, I've come specifically to seek him out," Ye Nantian said solemnly.</p><p></p><p>Ah?</p><p></p><p>Hearing Ye Nantian address Lu Changsheng as "senior", Ye Feng was greatly shaken.</p><p></p><p>Ye Zhuixing asked suspiciously, "What's the matter? What business do you have with Lu?"</p><p></p><p>Ye Nantian quickly transmitted a message, "Pavilion Elder, Xunmang told me that when he passed through the Heavenly Abyss, he encountered the Thousand-Tentacle Demoness. Guess what? That senior Lu destroyed her with a single strike!"</p><p></p><p>Oh?!</p><p></p><p>Ye Zhuixing's lazy gaze suddenly sharpened, and he slowly sat up.</p><p></p><p>At his level, he was well aware of what kind of strength was required to destroy the Thousand-Tentacle Demoness with a single strike in the Heavenly Abyss, her own domain.</p><p></p><p>Even Ye Zhuixing himself was not confident that he could eliminate her in a single strike, though he could probably do it within three strikes. But a single strike... that was truly remarkable.</p><p></p><p>Here is the full English translation of the Chinese excerpt:</p><p></p><p>Terrifying.</p><p></p><p>Just then, Lu Changsheng came down from the Cangwu Pavilion, walking towards Ye Nantian and the others.</p><p></p><p>"My lord," Ye Xunwang and Ye Feng immediately bowed.</p><p></p><p>Ye Nantian looked Lu Changsheng up and down, his expression surprised, and then cupped his hands and said, "Senior Lu, I am Ye Nantian, the clan leader of the Ye Clan. Previously, Xunwang did not inform me of your existence, and actually let this junior Ye Feng entertain you. This was a neglect on our part."</p><p></p><p>Ye Nantian was extremely polite, and there was a sense of respect in his words. Otherwise, he would not have addressed Lu Changsheng as "Senior".</p><p></p><p>Although Ye Nantian was the clan leader of a top-tier ancient clan, he had to take a powerful expert who could easily kill a thousand Chumo Demons seriously!</p><p></p><p>At this time, the Ye Clan disciples coming and going were all trembling as they watched this scene, understanding that a great figure had arrived in the Ye Clan.</p><p></p><p>Especially those who had previously witnessed Lu Changsheng disregarding the restrictions and ascending to the fourth floor, their minds were in a complete daze, trapped in a state of cognitive dissonance.</p><p></p><p>Lu? How did he manage to pass through the restrictions?</p><p></p><p>"No need," Lu Changsheng waved his hand with a smile.</p><p></p><p>Ye Xunwang, standing aside, let out a slight sigh of relief, initially worried that the lord might encounter some unpleasantness in the Ye Clan, but now it seemed fine.</p><p></p><p>It's a good thing he had informed the clan leader of the lord's abilities, which should have saved a lot of trouble.</p><p></p><p>At this moment, Ye Zhuixing stood up, cupped his hands, and said with a smile, "It was my mistake. I never expected that Daoist friend Lu would have such abilities, to be able to easily kill a thousand Chumo Demons, which even I cannot accomplish."</p><p></p><p>Lu Changsheng smiled lightly, "Just a small matter, not worth mentioning."</p><p></p><p>Huh, a small matter? Killing a thousand Chumo Demons with a single move is just a small matter?</p><p></p><p>Ye Zhuixing and Ye Nantian were stunned, and they didn't know what to say about this unusual modesty, so they could only chuckle awkwardly.</p><p></p><p>Ye Zhuixing instructed Ye Nantian, "Nantian, I'm occupied here in the Cangwu Pavilion and can't get away. You must personally attend to the matters regarding Daoist friend Lu."</p><p></p><p>As he spoke, Ye Zhuixing's gaze at Ye Nantian flickered slightly.</p><p></p><p>Ye Nantian naturally understood Ye Zhuixing's meaning, and it could be said that Ye Zhuixing's thoughts were exactly the same as his own.</p><p></p><p>Such a top-tier expert had come to their doorstep. Regardless of the current turbulent situation in the Hollow Ancient Realm, or even in normal times, they must make every effort to win him over!</p><p></p><p>"Senior Lu, I will first take you to rest, and when it gets a little darker, I will host a banquet to welcome and refresh you," Ye Nan said.</p><p></p><p>Ye Xunwang, standing aside, was envious. Even his own uncle didn't seem as excited when he returned.</p><p></p><p>The lord is truly a great figure, with abilities that are sought after everywhere, not excluding the Hollow Ancient Realm.</p><p></p><p>Lu Changsheng smiled and said, "No need, as the clan leader, you must be busy with a myriad of affairs. I'm not that important, just let Ye Feng lead the way."</p><p></p><p>Ah, this?</p><p></p><p>Ye Nantian was a bit troubled. He still wanted to take the opportunity to deepen the friendship and prepare for the next invitation.</p><p></p><p>But Ye Nantian couldn't say anything, and could only sigh inwardly with regret, saying, "Alright, if Senior Lu has any instructions, Ye Feng must report to the clan leader immediately!"</p><p></p><p>When Ye Nantian turned to speak to Ye Feng, his tone suddenly became stern, startling Ye Feng, who hurriedly replied, "The clan leader can rest assured!"</p><p></p><p>"The Zhou Clan has arrived!"</p><p></p><p>At this moment, a report sounded in Ye Nantian's mind.</p><p></p><p>Ye Nantian's gaze sharpened, and then he looked at Lu Changsheng with a smile, "Senior Lu, I still have matters to attend to, so I'll be going first."</p><p></p><p>After seeing Lu Changsheng nod, Ye Nantian cupped his hands towards Ye Zhuixing and then left with a solemn expression.</p>

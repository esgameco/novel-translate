        <h1>Chapter 258</h1>
        <div class="content">
            <p>Here is the full English translation of the Chinese excerpt:</p><p></p><p>Ye Wutian and Guan Ning glanced at each other disdainfully and then sat down separately. üëä‚ôò‚ûÖ‚ûàùêíƒ¶·ªÆùê±.ÂåöùïÜÁà™üêùüéÑ</p><p></p><p>The broken tables and chairs had already been cleaned up by the monks, and the venue had regained its original order.</p><p></p><p>"The Tian Yan Taoist Temple, arrive!"</p><p></p><p>Suddenly, an announcement came from outside.</p><p></p><p>The entire venue suddenly fell silent, and countless people stood up again!</p><p></p><p>Many Buddhist and Taoist cultivators had a blazing light in their eyes!</p><p></p><p>Immediately afterwards, Zhang Shengxu led the Twelve Dao Disciples into the venue.</p><p></p><p>Wherever they went, whether it was the observing cultivators or the peak power elites, they all bowed in reverence, and the venue was filled with respectful greetings.</p><p></p><p>"Greetings, Dao Master."</p><p>"We greet the Dao Master."</p><p>"..."</p><p></p><p>Soon, Zhang Shengxu arrived at the front.</p><p></p><p>The crowd then saw that even the Twelve Divine Kings did not dare to be negligent, and they all bowed to Zhang Shengxu!</p><p></p><p>The Dao Master is indeed the Dao Master, truly one of the few peak figures in the Ancestral Heaven Spiritual Realm!</p><p></p><p>"Hehe, you Divine Kings need not be so polite. Today is the ceremony for Dhyana Master Jinguan, and if you all act this way, others might say that I, the poor Taoist, am stealing the limelight," Zhang Shengxu said with a faint smile, stroking his beard.</p><p></p><p>"Dao Master's words are weighty. Even the Spiritual Emperors must give you some face, we small Divine Kings, how dare we be negligent towards you," Ye Wutian immediately bowed humbly and smiled.</p><p></p><p>The rest of the Divine Kings also nodded, for this was the truth.</p><p></p><p>Moreover, between Dhyana Master Jinguan and Dao Master Shengxu, one had already died, while the other was still alive. They naturally understood the difference in importance.</p><p></p><p>Among them, more than half of the Divine Kings, including Ye Wutian, exchanged glances with Zhang Shengxu.</p><p></p><p>Zhang Shengxu's eyes flickered, and he nodded slightly, then walked over and sat down, closing his eyes and waiting.</p><p></p><p>At the moment, he was sitting in the front, the center of attention.</p><p></p><p>As for the Twelve Dao Disciples, they sat in a row with the Twelve Divine Kings.</p><p></p><p>Meanwhile, on the Buddhist altar in front, Huihai and the other monks looked at Zhang Shengxu with grave and displeased expressions.</p><p></p><p>Since Zhang Shengxu had arrived at the venue, he hadn't even glanced at them once...</p><p></p><p>Truly not giving them any importance at all.</p><p></p><p>How vexing.</p><p></p><p>...</p><p></p><p>Since Zhang Shengxu's arrival, the venue had fallen into a terrible silence.</p><p></p><p>The only sound was the faint chanting of the Buddhists.</p><p></p><p>The atmosphere had become eerie.</p><p></p><p>Countless gazes were discreetly scanning back and forth between Zhang Shengxu and Huihai and the others on the Buddhist altar.</p><p></p><p>They had a premonition that a conflict between the Tian Yin Temple and the Tian Yan Taoist Temple was bound to occur during today's ceremony!</p><p></p><p>Little did Zhang Shengxu know...</p><p></p><p>From the moment he entered the venue,</p><p></p><p>In the corner of the venue, there was a pair of special eyes calmly watching him, those eyes were extremely calm, without joy or sorrow.</p><p></p><p>The corner of the eye was constantly keeping an eye on Lu Changsheng's Chu Lingian and Yuan Yanqiu and the others, feeling a chill in the heart, not understanding what was going on.</p><p></p><p>It was the old turtle, he knew very well that whenever the master had such a gaze, someone was about to suffer a great misfortune.</p><p></p><p>Puzzled, he couldn't help but follow Lu Changsheng's line of sight and finally fixed his gaze on the front-most Zhang Shengxu.</p><p></p><p>His heart was even more alarmed, what's going on, could this old Taoist have offended the master?</p><p></p><p>Boom!!</p><p></p><p>Suddenly, an imperial might descended upon the venue!!</p><p></p><p>All the faces changed drastically, and they abruptly stood up!</p><p></p><p>Even Zhang Shengxu and Huihai on the Buddhist altar had their faces completely turn grave.</p><p></p><p>The next moment!</p><p></p><p>An supreme majestic yellow-robed elder appeared on the Buddhist altar, hands behind his back, with an indifferent expression!</p><p></p><p>Below the altar was Xing Tian leading the Twelve Guardians!</p><p></p><p>"Greetings, Spiritual Emperor!!"</p><p></p><p>At this moment, everyone knelt down in a grand manner!</p><p></p><p>Here is the full English translation of the Chinese excerpt:</p><p></p><p>The Twelve Guardians, the Twelve Divine Kings, the Twelve Dao Masters, the various peak forces at the upper echelons, and the eminent monks like Huihai - even Zhang Shengxu deeply bowed down to show their utmost respect to the supreme being of the Ancestral Celestial Realm!</p><p></p><p>"Hmm?" </p><p></p><p>At this moment, Yinyao's brows furrowed slightly.</p><p></p><p>His gaze was fixed on a corner of the venue!</p><p></p><p>Since everyone present was kneeling and worshipping, the blue-robed man sitting in the corner stood out conspicuously!</p><p></p><p>By Lu Changsheng's side, Old Turtle, Chu Lingian, and the others stood solemnly.</p><p></p><p>As for Yuanyang Qiu and the other elders, they had already knelt down.</p><p></p><p>After the venue had remained quiet for a while, the people who noticed the anomaly carefully raised their heads and looked towards Yinyao, only to see the Divine Emperor's brows slightly furrowed, with a hint of displeasure as he gazed at the corner!</p><p></p><p>Seeing this, the crowd was perplexed.</p><p></p><p>The next moment, they unanimously turned their heads towards that corner.</p><p></p><p>Instantly, </p><p></p><p>Zhang Shengxu, the Twelve Guardians, the Twelve Divine Kings, the Twelve Dao Masters, Monk Huihai, and all the gazes in the venue converged on the blue-robed man!!</p><p></p><p>Some were bewildered, some were dumbfounded, some were shocked, some were stunned, some were delighted,</p><p></p><p>and some... their faces turned deathly pale, as if they had seen a ghost in broad daylight!</p><p></p><p>"Lu, Lu, Lu Daifu... You, you, you..." </p><p></p><p>Yuanyang Qiu trembled as he transmitted his voice, he and the three elders, as well as the others like Yunran, were all frightened out of their wits!</p><p></p><p>If the atmosphere in the venue hadn't been so eerie, they might not have even noticed that Daifu Lu was still sitting calmly in his seat.</p><p></p><p>In the presence of the Divine Emperor, who would dare not pay their respects? Lu Daifu's actions... might have just invited a catastrophic disaster!</p><p></p><p>...</p><p></p><p>Zhang Shengxu, the Twelve Dao Masters, and the six Divine Kings Ye Wutian stared at the blue-robed man as if they had seen a ghost!!</p><p></p><p>Not only Ye Wutian and the others, even Zhang Shengxu's palms were starting to sweat profusely! He was already planning an escape route in his mind!</p><p></p><p>Lu Changsheng... couldn't have been... how is that possible?!</p><p></p><p>Although Ye Wutian also noticed Old Turtle and the others, he was no longer concerned about them.</p><p></p><p>Now, he was worried about his own life!!</p><p></p><p>"Senior Lu!!!"</p><p></p><p>At this moment, the crowd was shocked to see the First Guardian, Xing Tian, approach Lu Changsheng joyfully and bow before him.</p><p></p><p>Hiss‚Äî</p><p></p><p>The First Guardian actually bowed to someone!</p><p></p><p>In the past, aside from Divine Emperor Yinyao, who else had he shown such respect to?</p><p></p><p>Seeing this, Yuanyang Qiu, Yunran, and the others were as stiff as if they had fallen into an abyss, their hearts pounding frantically, as if they were about to jump out of their chests!</p><p></p><p>Xing Tian's demeanor shocked the other eleven Guardians. Aside from the Divine Emperor, when had they ever seen their leader show such reverence to someone else!</p><p></p><p>Not only them, even Divine Emperor Yinyao himself had his brows raised in a slight frown as he intently gazed at the calm and composed blue-robed man, as if he wanted to see through him!</p><p></p><p>How could there be such a figure in the Ancestral Celestial Realm, and he didn't know about it?!</p><p></p><p>Xing Tian, as the First Guardian, was clearly acquainted with this person, so why didn't he tell him?</p><p></p><p>The venue was so quiet that one could hear a pin drop, and even the faint Buddhist chants had disappeared without a trace.</p><p></p><p>...</p><p></p><p>Lu Changsheng gently smiled, then slowly rose to his feet amidst the countless gazes.</p><p></p><p>He looked at the joyful-faced black-armored man in front of him and patted his shoulder, softly saying, "Xing Tian, it's best if you stand aside today and don't get involved, lest you end up getting implicated."</p><p></p><p>Saying that, disregarding the stunned Xing Tian, he smoothed his sleeves and suddenly turned his head to look at Zhang Shengxu and the others.</p><p></p><p>A cold laughter echoed like a thunderclap on a clear day.</p><p></p><p>"Come over here!"</p>

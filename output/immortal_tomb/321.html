        <div class="content">
            <p>Here is the full English translation of the Chinese excerpt:</p><p></p><p>The Heavenly Vault. üçîüíõ‚ùªÔºôùï§ùê°ùî≤ùîµ.ùïî·µíùìÇüê∫üí≤</p><p></p><p>Everyone was stunned.</p><p></p><p>Even the two Heavenly Dao Lords who were about to leave were frozen in place.</p><p></p><p>What's going on? Who disagrees with the Ancient Clan's departure? And who wants the Ancient Clan to be destroyed today?</p><p></p><p>Knowing full well that the divine essences of the Seven Clan Ancestors are all present here, who would dare to utter such arrogant words? Could it be that the Eternal Vast Realm is still hiding some super powerhouses?</p><p></p><p>Not to mention the bewildered Ancient Clan experts, even the Seven Ancestors are slightly taken aback at the moment, their expressions gradually turning cold.</p><p></p><p>And when a young man in azure robes slowly appeared, the eyes of the Ancient Clan experts suddenly shrank in shock...</p><p></p><p>Lu Changsheng?!</p><p></p><p>They were first surprised, then their eyes filled with delight!!</p><p></p><p>They were not particularly afraid of Lu Changsheng, even though he was extremely powerful. After all, the previous Eight Clans had only sixteen Godly Dao Realm experts who were able to subdue him.</p><p></p><p>Not to mention the even more powerful Seven Ancestors present here, their nearly seventy Godly Dao Realm experts alone would be enough to crush Lu Changsheng!</p><p></p><p>Presumably Lu Changsheng has come for revenge, but what can he use to fight them? </p><p></p><p>What he couldn't do a hundred million years ago, he certainly can't do it now!</p><p></p><p>Lu Changsheng's actions could be described as delivering the Eternal Life Body right to their doorstep!</p><p></p><p>The Ancient Clan experts glanced at their own ancestors out of the corner of their eyes, not intending to inform the Seven Ancestors about Lu Changsheng possessing the Eternal Life Body. </p><p></p><p>If the Seven Ancestors found out, they might not even have a chance to take a sip of the soup.</p><p></p><p>They then looked at the two Heavenly Dao Lords, their gazes becoming increasingly flickering, not knowing whether the Heavenly Dao Lords were aware of the Eternal Life Body matter or not...</p><p></p><p>The two Heavenly Dao Lords seemed to be looking at Lu Changsheng, and for a moment they really didn't know who this person was.</p><p></p><p>Although they had heard of Lu Changsheng and the Eternal Life Body from the Eight Clans, they had never actually seen Lu Changsheng in person.</p><p></p><p>"Hehe, Lu Changsheng..." </p><p></p><p>But when the expert from the Void Ancient Beast Clan called out Lu Changsheng's name, the two Heavenly Dao Lords' figures shook slightly!</p><p></p><p>They might now know who the person in front of them was.</p><p></p><p>So it's him...</p><p></p><p>Lu Changsheng smiled slightly, completely disregarding the varying expressions of the Seven Ancestors, and slowly approached the Ancient Clan experts, his gaze sweeping across the faces of the sixty-eight Godly Dao Realm experts, and he said calmly with a smile:</p><p></p><p>"Not bad, everyone is here."</p><p></p><p>The Ancient Clan experts paused, and some even wanted to laugh out loud, but they held it back due to the presence of the Seven Ancestors.</p><p></p><p>"Hehe, Lu Changsheng..." The Void Ancient Beast Clan's patriarch had not even finished speaking when his expression suddenly changed!</p><p></p><p>Because Lu Changsheng suddenly turned his finger into a sword and slashed forward!!</p><p></p><p>Without any warning!</p><p></p><p>"Capture him!" The Void Ancient Beast Clan patriarch hurriedly shouted.</p><p></p><p>The sixty-eight Godly Dao Realm experts immediately mobilized their elemental power and the faint Dao principles, trying to directly suppress Lu Changsheng!</p><p></p><p>Although they did not understand why Lu Changsheng was being so reckless, at the moment they could not afford to ponder, and could only first try to subdue him.</p><p></p><p>The vast fluctuations, stirring the remnant clouds in the sky, with overwhelming power and intertwined Dao principles, even causing the space to violently tremble!</p><p></p><p>If it were not for the hidden Heavenly Dao Essences and the two Heavenly Dao Lords releasing the power of the Heavenly Dao, the space might have already shattered!</p><p></p><p>After all, this was the joint attack of sixty-eight Godly Dao Realm experts!</p><p></p><p>The expressions of the Seven Ancestors also slightly tightened at this moment, not because they were afraid of the attacks of the Godly Dao Realm experts, but because of Lu Changsheng...</p><p></p><p>They focused their gaze on Lu Changsheng, their eyes flashing with shock. This was not the Immortal-Demon Battlefield, but the Eternal Vast Realm. The Eternal Vast Realm actually had a person who could single-handedly face off against sixty-eight Godly Dao Realm experts?</p><p></p><p>Especially the Ancient Saint Clan's ancestor Bai Tian and the Jiang Clan's old ancestor Jiang Wuxin, the only two human race members among the Seven Ancestors, their eyes flashed with a hint of delight.</p><p></p><p>This trip of having their ancestral seals crushed was not entirely without gain.</p><p></p><p>The human race youth in front of them, they were quite satisfied with him. To be able to grow to such a level in the Eternal Vast Realm, if they were to bring him back to the Immortal-Demon Battlefield and provide guidance and tempering, in due time, he would surely become an elite combat force for the human race!</p><p></p><p>The next moment, Lu Changsheng's sword slashed forward, the majestic sword intent seemingly about to shatter the heavens!!</p><p></p><p>And finally, when the sword qi collided with the Ancient...</p><p></p><p>Here is my translation of the Chinese excerpt you provided:</p><p></p><p>The crowd of powerful clan members were facing off against each other... Suddenly, the heavens shook violently!</p><p></p><p>The two Heavenly Dao Lords and the hidden Heavenly Dao Origin were shocked - the Heavenly Dao forces that had stabilized the space actually disappeared under the influence of the sword qi!</p><p></p><p>How, how could this be possible!</p><p></p><p>"Crack, crack, crack‚Äî"</p><p></p><p>The space between heaven and earth suddenly shattered, with lightning flashing and thunderous rain pouring down!</p><p></p><p>"Impossible! Impossible! L√º Changsheng, after a hundred thousand years, there's no way you could have become this strong!! Ancestors, save us!!"</p><p></p><p>The powerful clan members' faces changed drastically as they cried out for help - their origin energy, even their Dao principles, were effortlessly extinguished by L√º Changsheng's single sword strike!</p><p></p><p>They couldn't understand, couldn't fathom how the L√º Changsheng who had been suppressed by sixteen Godly Dao Realm experts a hundred thousand years ago could have become so terrifying now. </p><p></p><p>It was beyond their imagination!</p><p></p><p>Among the Seven Ancestors, aside from the increasingly delighted Mang Tian and Jiang Wuxin, the other five Ancestors' expressions changed slightly - the situation had exceeded their expectations!</p><p></p><p>In the next moment, except for Mang Tian and Jiang Wuxin, Zixuan Yong and Blood Moon Ru suddenly vanished from their original spots. When they reappeared, they were standing in front of the powerful clan members, blocking the incoming sword qi like towering mountains.</p><p></p><p>They stared intently at the sweeping sword qi, not daring to be careless in the slightest, because... this was just a wisp of their divine sense, whether they could block it was still uncertain!</p><p></p><p>Seeing this, L√º Changsheng let out a faint smile: "You five... it seems you're also tired of living."</p><p></p><p>"Insolent brat!" Zixuan Yong angrily growled. How dare this young man speak to them in such a way!</p><p></p><p>"Hehe, then I'll just casually slay this wisp of divine sense of yours. I'm sure it will have an impact on your true bodies far away on the Godly-Demonic Battlefield," L√º Changsheng said indifferently.</p><p></p><p>Aside from the already aware Heavenly Dao Origin and the bewildered powerful clan members, the two Heavenly Dao Lords and the Seven Ancestors were all shocked to see L√º Changsheng.</p><p></p><p>How did he know about the Godly-Demonic Battlefield?!</p><p></p><p>But there was no time for them to ponder further, as the vast sword qi had already arrived!</p><p></p><p>Zixuan Yong and the other four Ancestors narrowed their eyes and struck out with a palm strike in unison.</p><p></p><p>However, as divine senses, their attacks might be terrifying to the powerful clan members, but they posed no threat to L√º Changsheng at all. Even if they struck him, L√º Changsheng doubted they could even tickle him.</p><p></p><p>In an instant, their palm strikes were swept away by the sword qi, which then charged towards their divine senses and the powerful clan members behind them!</p><p></p><p>"No!!!"</p><p></p><p>The powerful clan members cried out in horror and despair.</p><p></p><p>"So you're L√º Changsheng, huh... I hope you'll come to the Godly-Demonic Battlefield, my Emperor will be sure to give you a warm welcome then!" Facing the vast sword qi, Zixuan Yong's divine sense had already given up, and he looked at the young man in blue coldly.</p><p></p><p>The rest of the four Ancestors, including Blood Moon Ru, also had unsightly expressions as they stared at L√º Changsheng.</p><p></p><p>L√º Changsheng's face was expressionless: "Then I'll be waiting."</p><p></p><p>With that, the sword qi arrived!!</p><p></p><p>Boom!</p><p></p><p>At this moment, many powerful clan members seemed to have a sudden realization and cried out in unison:</p><p></p><p>"He has the Eternal Lifespan Body!!!"</p><p></p><p>"Haha, L√º Changsheng, you may be strong, but even if you kill us, your future will never be good! You'll face endless pursuit!"</p><p></p><p>Zixuan Yong and the others' eyes suddenly narrowed, looking at L√º Changsheng with disbelief, and then their pupils burst with boundless greed!</p><p></p><p>Sizzle, sizzle, sizzle!!!</p><p></p><p>At this time, the sword qi swept across the sky, instantly slaying the divine senses of the five Ancestors and sixty-eight powerful clan members!</p><p></p><p>"Boom‚Äî" A massive ripple spread out from this place, rushing towards the four corners of the Eternal Celestial Domain at an incredible speed. Everyone watched it clearly, deeply shocked - what kind of power was this...?</p><p></p><p>After an unknown amount of time, the Eternal Celestial Domain finally calmed down, and the space stopped shattering.</p><p></p><p>"Drip, drip, drip‚Äî"</p><p></p><p>Suddenly, without any warning, the sky of the Eternal Celestial Domain began to rain blood, endlessly.</p><p></p><p>L√º Changsheng stood with his hands behind his back, turning to look at the two dazed Heavenly Dao Lords and the stiffly frozen Mang Tian and Jiang Wuxin, and then smiled gently:</p><p></p><p>"The Eternal Lifespan Body, do you want it?"</p>

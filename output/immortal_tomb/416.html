        <h1>Chapter 416</h1>
        <div class="content">
            <p>Here is the full English translation of the Chinese excerpt:</p><p></p><p>After a short moment, the city guards arrived outside the courtyard and began to examine the ordinary-looking courtyard.</p><p></p><p>The leading city guard captain stepped forward, knocked on the door, and shouted loudly, "Is anyone there...uh."</p><p></p><p>But before the city guard captain could finish his words, the courtyard gate creaked open, and an old, hunched man appeared before the crowd.</p><p></p><p>The old turtle glanced at the city guards and said impatiently, "What the hell are you inquiring about? Daring to disturb the master's rest, be careful or your heads will be gone. Today Grandpa Turtle is in a good mood, so I'll let you off. If you dare to come and bother us again, don't blame Grandpa Turtle for slaughtering you all. Scram!"</p><p></p><p>Creak!</p><p></p><p>The old turtle finished speaking and then closed the gate.</p><p></p><p>The group of city guards were left dumbfounded on the spot.</p><p></p><p>What's going on? </p><p></p><p>Who is this old man? How dare he be so arrogant?</p><p></p><p>Does he not know who they are?</p><p></p><p>They are from the City Lord's Mansion, after all!</p><p></p><p>The faces of the city guards turned extremely unsightly, and they all looked towards the captain, whose expression was also extremely unpleasant.</p><p></p><p>The captain's gaze turned sinister, and he waved his hand and shouted, "Barge in, I want to see who in Tianxiang City dares to go against our City Lord's Mansion!"</p><p></p><p>"Yes!!"</p><p></p><p>The city guards immediately responded.</p><p></p><p>Even if the people in the courtyard had some power, in Tianxiang City, which force could be greater than the City Lord's Mansion?</p><p></p><p>With the City Lord's Mansion backing them, they had no fear at all!</p><p></p><p>Boom!!</p><p></p><p>In an instant, the ordinary-looking gate of the courtyard was blasted to pieces by the city guards.</p><p></p><p>The city guards immediately saw the somewhat gloomy-faced old man standing in the courtyard, as well as the young man in blue robes sitting and engrossed in reading a score.</p><p></p><p>The city guards paused for a moment, then their eyes lit up with joy and disbelief!</p><p></p><p>Great, the zither immortal they had been searching for days was actually hiding here? It was really effortless to find him!</p><p></p><p>"Hehe, so you're hiding here. These past few days, we've been searching for you a lot! The City Lord has ordered that you are not allowed to linger in Tianxiang City, so leave immediately. If we have to take action ourselves, it won't be just a simple expulsion..."</p><p></p><p>The city guard captain sneered coldly.</p><p></p><p>The city guards all had a mocking expression on their faces, but when they found that the young man in blue robes was still holding the score and didn't even glance at them... they instantly became furious!</p><p></p><p>How dare he ignore them!</p><p></p><p>How could he do that?!</p><p></p><p>The city guard captain's eyes flashed with anger, and he was about to scold them, when the old turtle suddenly said coldly, "It seems you've ignored what Grandpa Turtle said..."</p><p></p><p>As he spoke, a strange green glow flashed in his eyes!!</p><p></p><p>"Boom, boom, boom, boom--!"</p><p></p><p>The city guards were instantly blown into a bloody mist!</p><p></p><p>Only the city guard captain was left standing stiffly, his eyes filled with terror.</p><p></p><p>What... what happened?</p><p></p><p>The old turtle looked at the city guard captain mockingly. He left this person alive, as it was the master's intention, otherwise he would have also turned into a bloody mist. Killing these low-level city guards was no different than killing chickens for him.</p><p></p><p>"Master," the old turtle said respectfully, looking towards Lu Changsheng.</p><p></p><p>Lu Changsheng slowly put down the score in his hand and raised his gaze to the city guard captain.</p><p></p><p>The city guard captain trembled, his face becoming even paler. Those eyes, like bottomless abysses, brought him a terrifying sense of oppression.</p><p></p><p>Bang!</p><p></p><p>The city guard captain's mind was already terrified to the extreme, and when he met those eyes, he finally could not bear it and knelt down, trembling and saying, "G-great... great lord..."</p><p></p><p>Lu Changsheng withdrew his gaze and looked back at the score, saying softly, "Tell your City Lord to come see me."</p><p></p><p>"Y-yes... yes..." </p><p></p><p>The city guard captain kowtowed and replied in a trembling voice.</p><p></p><p>At this moment, the city guard captain felt like his soul was about to fly away. He only knew to agree to everything, or else his fate would only be death.</p><p></p><p>"What, still not leaving? Do you want Grandpa Turtle to send you off?" </p><p></p><p>The old turtle pretended to smile bloodthirstily.</p><p></p><p>The city guard captain scrambled and crawled out of the courtyard in terror.</p><p></p><p>"Hehe hehe!" The old turtle laughed when he saw this.</p><p></p><p>Lu Changsheng turned a page of the score and said indifferently, "Go repair the courtyard gate, and then either go cultivate or stand guard, don't bother me."</p><p></p><p>"Ah? Yes, yes, yes." The old turtle replied with a sheepish smile, then hurriedly left.</p><p></p><p>Here is my translation of the Chinese excerpt:</p><p></p><p>He went to repair the door.</p><p></p><p>...</p><p></p><p>In the lord's manor, Guo Xiong's tone had a hint of anger:</p><p></p><p>"It's been so many days, and the Ninth Prince and the Qin Saint are about to arrive, but you still haven't found that Qin Immortal? Are you all just a bunch of good-for-nothings?!"</p><p></p><p>"Ahem, my lord, the city guard has conducted a near-exhaustive search, but still found nothing. In my view, that Qin Immortal may have already left long ago," the manor administrator said rather awkwardly.</p><p></p><p>The administrator felt that the lord was also calling him a good-for-nothing, since he was the one who directly ordered the city guard.</p><p></p><p>"Hmph." Guo Xiong coldly snorted as he looked at the administrator, not saying anything further.</p><p></p><p>Just then, the administrator's expression changed as he looked at Guo Xiong: "My lord, we have news of that Qin Immortal!"</p><p></p><p>Oh?</p><p></p><p>Guo Xiong's eyes lit up, and he said with relief, "That's not bad, to be able to find him at the last moment!"</p><p></p><p>But when Guo Xiong saw the administrator's expression was not quite right, he became suspicious. "What's wrong? Surely there's no mishap?"</p><p></p><p>The administrator's eyes flickered as he spoke in a low voice, "My lord, it's best if the city guard captain comes in and tells you directly."</p><p></p><p>Guo Xiong nodded.</p><p></p><p>Soon, the pale-faced city guard captain entered under Guo Xiong's questioning gaze. </p><p></p><p>Without waiting for Guo Xiong to ask, the captain knelt down, trembling as he said, "My lord, my brothers and I found that Qin Immortal by Youting Lake, but except for me, all my brothers are... dead..."</p><p></p><p>What?!!</p><p></p><p>Guo Xiong's expression changed abruptly, and he suddenly stood up, glaring at the city guard captain and demanding, "Say that again?!"</p><p></p><p>Guo Xiong even thought he might have misheard! </p><p></p><p>That Qin Immortal dared to kill his city guard on his own turf?</p><p></p><p>The city guard captain's body trembled as he repeated it.</p><p></p><p>Guo Xiong's eyes immediately filled with murderous intent as he growled, "He's got a lot of nerve! I was only going to drive him away, not kill him, but he went and killed my city guard! Audacious!"</p><p></p><p>At this point, the administrator frowned and asked the captain, "How did the conflict start?"</p><p></p><p>The trembling captain stammered, "No, no, we were being polite at first, but he... he just attacked without a word..."</p><p></p><p>Hearing this, the administrator's gaze became somewhat suspicious. He knew the city guard quite well, and with the city lord's manor right behind them, could they really have been that polite...</p><p></p><p>But now was not the time to dig deeper, as the fact was that the Qin Immortal had killed people.</p><p></p><p>No matter how it happened, they couldn't attack the city guard - that would be openly defying the lord's manor, as if they didn't take the lord's manor seriously at all!</p><p></p><p>The administrator asked again, "Describe in detail how your brothers died, and how you managed to come back alive."</p><p></p><p>"I-I don't know, I didn't see how my brothers died, I just know they suddenly... exploded..." The city guard captain still shuddered at the memory.</p><p></p><p>Hearing this, Guo Xiong and the administrator exchanged a glance, their expressions turning grave.</p><p></p><p>Mysterious explosions?</p><p></p><p>At this point, the city guard captain carefully looked at Guo Xiong and then lowered his head, saying, "He... he let me come back, and in the end said... that he wants the lord to come see him..."</p><p></p><p>Guo Xiong and the administrator paused.</p><p></p><p>Then Guo Xiong's anger rose from his heart as he said word by word, "How audacious... He killed the people of my lord's manor, and still wants me, the lord, to go see him? Then I shall oblige him! Administrator, you're coming with me!"</p><p></p><p>But just then, a messenger from outside called, "My lord! The Ninth Prince and the Qin Saint have arrived!"</p><p></p><p>Guo Xiong's heart jumped, and he could only deeply suppress the killing intent in his heart. He quickly said a few words to the administrator, and the two of them hurried out.</p><p></p><p>On the way, the administrator's words made Guo Xiong's heart tighten.</p><p></p><p>"My lord, according to the city guard captain's words, that Qin Immortal may have some abilities..."</p><p></p><p>"Now that it has come to this, with the Ninth Prince and the Qin Saint arriving, shall we take the opportunity to... use someone else's knife?"</p>

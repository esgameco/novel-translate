        <h1>Chapter 418</h1>
        <div class="content">
            <p>Here is the full English translation of the Chinese excerpt:</p><p></p><p>Today, Youting Lake was the liveliest it had ever been, with a crowd so dense it could be described as a "sea of people."</p><p></p><p>After all, the Lord of the City had issued an order, and almost all the women in the entire Tianxiang City had gathered at Youting Lake.</p><p></p><p>As a result, Youting Lake was exceptionally noisy.</p><p></p><p>Until Cloud Ao Xie and Ye Xun Wang, escorted by Guo Xiong and the others, slowly approached Youting Lake, and everyone unanimously closed their mouths.</p><p></p><p>The young women of Tianxiang City looked at the noble Prince in the center with a somewhat frightened gaze.</p><p></p><p>This person should be the legendary Ninth Prince, Cloud Ao Xie.</p><p></p><p>They would not be blinded by his outward appearance, for the true nature of the Ninth Prince was well known to all.</p><p></p><p>"Hehe, not bad," Cloud Ao Xie's lips curled into a smile, not knowing whether he was praising the scenery of Youting Lake or something else.</p><p></p><p>Hearing this, Guo Xiong let out a slight sigh of relief and respectfully said:</p><p></p><p>"Your Highness the Ninth Prince, Qin Saint, do you wish to stroll along Youting Lake to admire the scenery, or go to the pavilion over there to rest for a while?"</p><p></p><p>"Uncle Ye, shall we sit for a while first..."</p><p></p><p>Cloud Ao Xie turned his head and asked, but before he could finish, he was shocked to see Ye Xun Wang raise his hand to interrupt him!</p><p></p><p>And Ye Xun Wang's brow was actually furrowed at the moment!</p><p></p><p>Cloud Ao Xie's gaze became somewhat doubtful. When had he ever seen Uncle Ye in such a changed state since leaving the capital?</p><p></p><p>Could there be an ambush targeting him, Cloud Ao Xie?</p><p></p><p>Who in the ancient country of Cloud Lan would be so bold?</p><p></p><p>Thinking of this, Cloud Ao Xie's gaze slightly narrowed as he scrutinized the surroundings.</p><p></p><p>Huh?</p><p></p><p>Guo Xiong and the others immediately sensed something was wrong, and their hearts became tense.</p><p></p><p>If the Ninth Prince were to encounter any mishap in their Tianxiang City, perhaps the entire city would not be able to escape unscathed!</p><p></p><p>As the eerie atmosphere spread, the countless citizens of Youting Lake, like a vast sea, also sensed something amiss and became tense as well!</p><p></p><p>Until Ye Xun Wang suddenly spoke, everyone was stunned.</p><p></p><p>"In the air of this Youting Lake, there is a faint melody lingering. Has someone played music here before?"</p><p></p><p>Ah? A lingering melody in the air?</p><p></p><p>Quickly, everyone associated it with the occasional musician who had played at Youting Lake.</p><p></p><p>Could it be...?</p><p></p><p>The gazes of the crowd were mixed with confusion and shock. The Qin Saint was indeed the Qin Saint, able to perceive the lingering melodies in the air...</p><p></p><p>After all, they could only sense the dense spiritual energy and faint spiritual aura in the air, nothing else.</p><p></p><p>Guo Xiong, Zhu Gu Yuan, and the estate manager were all startled. They immediately thought of the musician that Ye Xun Wang had asked about!</p><p></p><p>"Hmph! Insolent! When the Qin Saint asks a question, you'd better answer quickly!" Cloud Ao Xie said coldly.</p><p></p><p>Guo Xiong's heart trembled, and he swallowed hard, stammering, "R-returning to the Qin Saint, there was a musician who had played here at Youting Lake before..."</p><p></p><p>Ye Xun Wang's gaze flickered, and he nodded slightly, "Do you know where that musician is now?"</p><p></p><p>"I-I don't know..." Guo Xiong replied tremblingly.</p><p></p><p>While bowing, Guo Xiong's peripheral vision glanced towards the distant courtyard, although he knew the musician was inside, he dared not reveal this, nor did he dare to call that musician the "Qin Immortal" as the citizens did.</p><p></p><p>"A musician?" Cloud Ao Xie frowned and said, "Uncle Ye, a mere musician, what virtue or ability could he possess to deserve your, the Qin Saint's, attention?"</p><p></p><p>To everyone's surprise, Ye Xun Wang slowly shook his head and said, "Ao Xie, you don't understand. That musician is not an ordinary musician."</p><p></p><p>What?!</p><p></p><p>Cloud Ao Xie's gaze shook!</p><p></p><p>In this ancient country of Cloud Lan, this was the first time Cloud Ao Xie had seen a musician receive Ye Xun Wang's affirmation!</p><p></p><p>Guo Xiong, the estate manager, Zhu Gu Yuan, and the others also had their pupils constrict sharply!</p><p></p><p>They understood very well the high praise in Ye Xun Wang's words, as the Qin Saint.</p><p></p><p>That "Qin Immortal"...</p><p></p><p>The many who had heard the music at Youting Lake were...</p><p></p><p>Here is the full English translation of the Chinese excerpt:</p><p></p><p>The expressions on the faces of the city residents were complex as Long Sheng played the zither.</p><p></p><p>They had heard the playing of the Zither Immortal before, and that was undoubtedly the most melodious heavenly music they had ever heard in their lives!</p><p></p><p>However, the playing of the Zither Saint, a renowned figure in the ancient country of Yunlan, was something the city residents had not heard before.</p><p></p><p>If not for the awe of the Zither Saint's prestige and the royal family's authority, the residents would have thought that the Zither Immortal deserved the true title of Zither Saint!</p><p></p><p>"For ordinary zither masters, the music they play will quickly dissipate after they finish, unable to linger in the air. But for a zither master whose music can linger in the air, their level has already reached the highest realm," Ye Xunwang said with a smile.</p><p></p><p>Ye Xunwang was in a good mood at the moment. He didn't expect to gain such a harvest by coming to this remote place.</p><p></p><p>This zither master he had never met before had excellent natural talent.</p><p></p><p>Ye Xunwang couldn't help but feel a sense of cherishing this talent.</p><p></p><p>In such a remote small city, to have cultivated one's zither skills to this level was indeed not an easy feat.</p><p></p><p>Ah?</p><p></p><p>Cloud Ao Xie was stunned. He immediately realized that Ye Xunwang had actually developed the intention to take this zither master as a disciple!</p><p></p><p>Cloud Ao Xie felt a sense of sourness in his heart. He had tried to become Ye Xunwang's disciple many times but was always rejected, not even getting the face of his father the king.</p><p></p><p>Now, what was going on? A zither master from a small place was qualified?</p><p></p><p>Guo Xiong and the others were also dumbfounded, their hearts trembling!</p><p></p><p>Guo Xiong and the manor steward's hearts were shaking. The so-called Zither Immortal was actually so highly regarded by the Zither Saint?</p><p></p><p>At first, they thought the Zither Saint would be furious, but this was completely different from what they had imagined!</p><p></p><p>Now, what should they do? They had already offended the Zither Immortal!</p><p></p><p>Just then, Ye Xunwang levitated and sat down, and an ancient zither appeared floating in front of him!</p><p></p><p>Cloud Ao Xie was stunned for a moment, then excitedly waved to Guo Xiong and the others, "Step back! Uncle Ye is about to play!"</p><p></p><p>Guo Xiong and the others were greatly startled and hurriedly stepped aside, giving Ye Xunwang a wide space.</p><p></p><p>The city residents saw this and their eyes gleamed with excitement. The legendary Zither Saint was actually going to play the zither? </p><p></p><p>They wanted to witness the competition between the Zither Immortal and the Zither Saint.</p><p></p><p>They would be able to tell the difference in their skills just by listening!</p><p></p><p>Ye Xunwang's gaze was calm. He guessed that the zither master was still in the Tianxiang City, so he wanted to use the music to lure out that zither master.</p><p></p><p>The next moment, Ye Xunwang's hands started plucking the zither strings!</p><p></p><p>The zither sounds were crisp and soothing, flowing and tranquil.</p><p></p><p>The crowd's expressions stiffened as they listened to the melody ringing in their ears, inwardly sighing, "Indeed, the Zither Saint is truly skilled."</p><p></p><p>Just the prelude had almost captivated them.</p><p></p><p>It's just that compared to the Zither Immortal, it still seemed to be a little lacking.</p><p></p><p>But that did not prevent the crowd from being enchanted, as who would not listen to such beautiful playing for free?</p><p></p><p>The wise appreciate, the foolish compare.</p><p></p><p>Gradually, the speed of Ye Xunwang's hands on the zither strings increased!</p><p></p><p>In the Youting Lake, ripples suddenly started to form with the rhythm, and the withered leaves in it seemed like small boats.</p><p></p><p>On the shore, the birds even started to sing along with the zither music.</p><p></p><p>Wow, the Zither Saint truly deserves the title of Zither Saint!</p><p></p><p>This performance has shocked the crowd!</p><p></p><p>Ye Xunwang was one with the zither, closing his eyes as his hands continued to pluck the strings.</p><p></p><p>But just as the crowd was immersed in it...</p><p></p><p>Suddenly, from the distant unnamed courtyard, zither sounds erupted!!</p><p></p><p>The zither style was completely different from Ye Xunwang's tranquil and graceful one, being abrupt like thunderstorms and winds, soaring like an eagle in the vast sky!</p><p></p><p>The fierce zither sounds completely overwhelmed Ye Xunwang's playing!</p><p></p><p>At the same time, the zither strings Ye Xunwang was plucking all snapped!!</p><p></p><p>Ye Xunwang's hand trembled, and he abruptly opened his eyes, looking towards the distant courtyard in disbelief!</p>

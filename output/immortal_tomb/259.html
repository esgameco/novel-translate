        <h1>Chapter 259</h1>
        <div class="content">
            <p>Here is my translation of the Chinese excerpt:</p><p></p><p>"Get over here!" </p><p></p><p>This statement thundered through the venue, causing the unsuspecting crowd to briefly lose their hearing. üç¨‚ò†‚ûÖÔºôùî∞‚íΩùî≤Ôº∏.ùïî·ªñÁà™üêü‚ô†</p><p></p><p>Old Turtle and the four, including Chu Lingian, also snapped out of their shock, especially Chu Lingian and the others, who looked at the man in blue robes with extremely complex expressions.</p><p></p><p>They never imagined that the Immortal Emperor of Longevity's abilities would reach such an exaggerated extent, that even the First Guardian of the Divine Emperor's Palace had to pay respects!</p><p></p><p>When and where did the Immortal Emperor of Longevity get to know the First Guardian?</p><p></p><p>...</p><p></p><p>Xing Tian's heart trembled, and he followed Luchengsheng's line of sight.</p><p></p><p>He saw Zhang Shengxu and the others, their faces pale and their demeanor extremely unnatural...</p><p></p><p>Xing Tian's lips tightened, his throat dry.</p><p></p><p>Thinking of the Scar of the Heavens, he suddenly understood.</p><p></p><p>The Ancestral Heavenly God Realm actually had participants...</p><p></p><p>And during that time, he happened to be in the Scar of the Heavens.</p><p></p><p>Xing Tian suddenly thought of something else, his heart tightening, and he quickly looked towards the Divine Emperor Yinyao!</p><p></p><p>Seeing his expression slightly puzzled, he breathed a slight sigh of relief...</p><p></p><p>...</p><p></p><p>The venue was silent as a grave, this sudden situation causing the crowd to not dare to even take a breath.</p><p></p><p>Countless gazes of doubt and astonishment were sweeping back and forth between the man in blue robes and Zhang Shengxu and the others.</p><p></p><p>This man in blue robes... was he telling the Heavenly Scroll Taoist Master Zhang to get out?</p><p></p><p>Whew!</p><p></p><p>Although unaware of what grievances were involved, but it is known what kind of person Zhang Taoist Master is?</p><p></p><p>On the Buddha's altar.</p><p></p><p>Yinyao frowned, silent, his sidelong glances shifting between Luchengsheng and Zhang Shengxu and the others, his eyes flickering, unaware of his inner thoughts.</p><p></p><p>Afterwards, the high monks like Huihai looked at the man in the corner with an ugly expression.</p><p></p><p>This was the ceremony of their Tianyin Temple Mirror Observation Buddha Master, and he actually caused a disturbance!</p><p></p><p>If they had not been shocked to see the First Guardian pay respects to him, their hearts would have already begun to be unsure, and they would have certainly taken action to drive him away or eliminate him!</p><p></p><p>...</p><p></p><p>"Taoist Master, Luchengsheng has actually broken the seal, what, what should we do?"</p><p></p><p>"Taoist Master, those mysterious strong ones didn't they erase Luchengsheng's memories? Why did he find us?!"</p><p></p><p>"Taoist Master..."</p><p></p><p>"..."</p><p></p><p>At this moment, the frantic voice transmissions of Ye Wutian and the others were ringing frantically in Zhang Shengxu's mind!</p><p></p><p>His head was splitting with pain!</p><p></p><p>"Shut up!" Zhang Shengxu's face turned ashen as he waved his sleeve fiercely!</p><p></p><p>Immediately, Ye Wutian and the others stopped the voice transmission.</p><p></p><p>But their pupils were trembling as they looked at the man in blue robes, they clearly knew...</p><p></p><p>How powerful Luchengsheng was!</p><p></p><p>Zhang Shengxu frantically calmed his anxious heart, then straightened his clothes and took a deep breath, stepping forward amidst the countless astonished gazes, and bowed respectfully, saying,</p><p></p><p>"Shengxu pays his respects, it has been a long time, Senior Lucheng's bearing is even more impressive than before."</p><p></p><p>Boom!</p><p></p><p>The entire venue was shocked!</p><p></p><p>Who was Taoist Master Zhang? Taoist Master Zhang was one of the few peak powerhouses of the Ancestral Heavenly God Realm,</p><p></p><p>Yet now he was in such a respectful posture...</p><p></p><p>The previous actions of the First Guardian alone had already shocked them for a long time.</p><p></p><p>And now Taoist Master Zhang's posture has completely blown their eyes open!</p><p></p><p>Just who was this man in blue robes!?</p><p></p><p>Zhang Shengxu's actions caused the Yinyao on the Buddha's altar to also become grave-faced, his old eyes staring at Luchengsheng, as if wanting to dig into him deeply!</p><p></p><p>"Senior Lucheng's bearing is even more impressive than before!"</p><p></p><p>Following Zhang Shengxu, the guilty-looking Ye Wutian and the other divine kings, as well as the Twelve Dao Disciples, also paid their respects at this moment, their hearts nervous to the point of bursting.</p><p></p><p>Here is the full English translation of the excerpt from the Chinese novel:</p><p></p><p>At this moment, the audience in the venue had been completely stunned.</p><p></p><p>Especially for those who knew Luchang Sheng, such as Yuanyang Qiu, Yun Mi and the others, their foreheads were pressed firmly on the ground, trembling in fear to the depths of their souls!</p><p></p><p>Luchang Sheng's terrifying and explosive presence was even more god-like than the Deity Yintao on the Buddhist altar!!!</p><p></p><p>...</p><p></p><p>Luchang Sheng stood with his hands behind his back, looking indifferently at Zhang Shengxu and the others, and said in a low voice, "Let them come over... Don't you understand?"</p><p></p><p>Upon hearing this, the faces of Zhang Shengxu and the others turned deathly pale!</p><p></p><p>The last glimmer of hope in their hearts vanished completely!</p><p></p><p>They realized that Luchang Sheng would not spare them at all!</p><p></p><p>"Hahaha......"</p><p></p><p>In the silent venue, Zhang Shengxu suddenly threw his head back and laughed loudly. Then, the laughter paused, and he stared fiercely at Luchang Sheng, shouting, "Since you won't relent, then there's nothing more to be said!"</p><p></p><p>He then turned his head to look at Yintao on the Buddhist altar and bowed, saying, "Deity, are you willing to join forces with this humble Taoist priest to slay this man?"</p><p></p><p>Upon hearing this, the hearts of the audience were shaken again.</p><p></p><p>Was the mysterious blue-robed man really that powerful that Zhang Shengxu had to ally with the Deity?</p><p></p><p>Yintao raised his eyebrows slightly and said indifferently, "What personal grudge does Zhang Taoist have to do with this Deity?"</p><p></p><p>"Hehe! Deity, although this matter has nothing to do with you, the six Deity Kings, including Yewutian, are all involved, and they are your people in the Deity Palace, are they not?" Zhang Shengxu sneered coldly and said mysteriously, "Even if you don't intervene, when the news reaches the Ancestral Heavenly Realm, the mighty Deity will be seen as unable to protect even his own subordinates."</p><p></p><p>Boom!</p><p></p><p>The minds of the audience were shaken, and everyone could hear that Zhang Taoist was openly and blatantly provoking the Deity!</p><p></p><p>Xingtian's brows furrowed deeply!</p><p></p><p>Yintao's chest heaved slightly. He naturally knew that Zhang Shengxu was provoking him, but what he said was the truth!</p><p></p><p>However, he was at a loss on how to handle it!</p><p></p><p>Yintao's gaze turned to the calm and indifferent blue-robed man, and he was at a loss on how to proceed!</p><p></p><p>"Deity! Please do not interfere in Senior Luchang's affairs!!!"</p><p></p><p>At this moment, Xingtian's urgent voice transmission rang in Yintao's mind.</p><p></p><p>Yintao's eyes narrowed as he stared at Xingtian, waiting for his explanation.</p><p></p><p>"Yewutian and the other six Deity Kings may have already colluded with Zhang Shengxu. They have a life-and-death feud with Senior Luchang. Deity, do not intervene for them, it's not worth it!"</p><p></p><p>"Moreover, Xingtian has fought with Senior Luchang before... He is not an opponent to be taken lightly."</p><p></p><p>Xingtian's voice transmission ended.</p><p></p><p>Yintao's pupils had contracted infinitely.</p><p></p><p>As his first guardian, Xingtian's strength was something Yintao knew very well.</p><p></p><p>Even so, this blue-robed man was not an opponent Xingtian could defeat with a single move?!</p><p></p><p>Xingtian was, after all, a top-tier expert at the Deity Realm Transformation Stage!</p><p></p><p>After the Nine Transformations of the Immortal Ancestor, one would reach the Deity Realm, and the powerful experts in the Ancestral Heavenly Realm could be counted on one's fingers.</p><p></p><p>Yintao, Jinguan, Zhang Shengxu, Xingtian, as well as the ancient demon who fell into the Abyss Sea and the ancient monster of the Endless Abyss, each of them was a supreme powerhouse in the Ancestral Heavenly Realm!</p><p></p><p>Yintao took a light breath, and he chose to believe Xingtian. He then said very naturally, "Zhang Taoist, the Deity Kings under my command, such as Yewutian, may have already colluded with you, right? How could I possibly lend a hand to traitors?"</p><p></p><p>Upon hearing this, Xingtian heaved a sigh of relief.</p><p></p><p>As for Zhang Shengxu and the others, their faces changed!</p><p></p><p>"Deity! It's a false accusation! We have always been loyal to the Deity Palace. How could we have colluded with Zhang Taoist? Please, Deity, see through this!"</p><p></p><p>Yewutian and the other six Deity Kings hurriedly knelt down, trembling as they spoke.</p><p></p><p>As for the other six Deity Kings, such as Guanning, they stood to the side, expressionless.</p>

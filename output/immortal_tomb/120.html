        <h1>Chapter 120</h1>
        <div class="content">
            <p>Here is the full English translation of the Chinese excerpt:</p><p></p><p>"Aiyoo. üç™üòù‚ûÖ‚ûà‚ìàƒ§ùïå‚ìß.¬¢ùê®ùî™‚òÆ‚ôú"</p><p></p><p>The old turtle looked at the group of soul collectors with some surprise, giving them a thumbs up and praising, "Well done, you must be the newly promoted soul collectors, right?"</p><p></p><p>The soul collectors were shocked!</p><p></p><p>How did this old man know they were newly promoted!</p><p></p><p>"We don't care who you are, please leave the soul realm, this place is not for the likes of you living beings!" </p><p></p><p>The lead soul collector tightly gripped the soul lock in his hand, sternly shouting.</p><p></p><p>Without knowing the other party's background, they dared not act rashly, and could only try to politely expel them.</p><p></p><p>Lu Changsheng smiled without saying a word.</p><p></p><p>The old turtle had initially wanted to slap these soul collectors away with a palm strike, but then thought that they were just doing their jobs, so he didn't make a move for the time being.</p><p></p><p>Just then,</p><p></p><p>A soul body swooped in from the distance, the voice arriving before the soul itself!</p><p></p><p>"Who dares to trespass the soul realm!"</p><p></p><p>The soul collectors all heaved a sigh of relief, their leader had finally arrived, they were about to be unable to hold on.</p><p></p><p>When the soul body arrived, the old turtle was slightly surprised, then revealed a meaningful smile.</p><p></p><p>"Well, if it isn't the old butler from the Moli Manor? Doing quite well for yourself after death, becoming the head of the soul collectors."</p><p></p><p>More than six hundred years ago, the old turtle had not personally witnessed the butler's death, as he had been slapped out of the spiritual realm by Lu Changsheng at the time.</p><p></p><p>But he quickly understood, this old butler must have ridden on Lu Changsheng's coattails, otherwise he would have already been reincarnated, how could he be comfortably serving as the head of the soul collectors?</p><p></p><p>The old butler stiffened, looking at the young man in blue with disbelief and joy, exclaiming, "Master!! Master!!!"</p><p></p><p>Hearing this, the soul collectors were dumbfounded, shocked one after another.</p><p></p><p>This young man in blue, it turned out he had a relationship with their leader!</p><p></p><p>The next moment, the old butler excitedly went over and respectfully bowed down, "Master, it's been so long!"</p><p></p><p>Seeing this, the soul collectors trembled, realizing that it was not the young man in blue who had a relationship with their leader, but rather their leader who had a relationship with this young man.</p><p></p><p>And this young man seemed to be of great importance, this much they could confirm.</p><p></p><p>Instinctively, they all knelt down as well.</p><p></p><p>For safety's sake, it was better to kneel first and then speak.</p><p></p><p>"It seems you've been doing well these past years," Lu Changsheng said with a smile to the old butler.</p><p></p><p>Encountering an old friend in a strange land, the old butler's heart was filled with excitement as he deeply bowed, "It's all thanks to Master's grace."</p><p></p><p>Although he didn't know exactly how powerful Lu Changsheng was, but from the Soul Emperor's earlier behavior, he could more or less understand.</p><p></p><p>Not to mention, the Soul Warden was the supreme ruler of this vast soul realm after all...</p><p></p><p>Lu Changsheng nodded slightly.</p><p></p><p>After the joy, the old butler lowered his head and tremblingly asked, "Master, over six hundred years... I've never seen Lord Chen's soul in the soul realm, he... he..."</p><p></p><p>After becoming the head of the soul collectors in this domain under the Soul Warden's instructions, he had ordered all the soul collectors to keep a close watch for Chen Dadao's soul, so that if it was found, they could properly accommodate him, so he wouldn't have to reincarnate.</p><p></p><p>But it had been over six hundred years!</p><p></p><p>The old butler was very puzzled, logically speaking, Chen Dadao should have died a long time ago.</p><p></p><p>Strangely, his soul had never been seen.</p><p></p><p>The old butler had wanted to apply to check the register of the living and the dead in the mortal realm, but with his current position, his authority was not enough.</p><p></p><p>In any case, he was very worried about Chen Dadao.</p><p></p><p>"You don't need to worry about that, after your death, Chen Dadao has already embarked on the path of cultivation," Lu Changsheng said with a light smile.</p><p></p><p>Here is the full English translation of the Chinese excerpt:</p><p></p><p>What?! </p><p></p><p>The master has cultivated immortality?!</p><p></p><p>The old butler's soul trembled, his mouth agape, feeling a bit dejected. The master had secretly cultivated immortality behind his back, so wouldn't that mean he would never see the master again?</p><p></p><p>But soon, he slapped himself. Since the master could cultivate immortality, he should be happy about it!</p><p></p><p>"That...that's great," the old butler said with a relieved smile.</p><p></p><p>"Don't worry, you will see him again one day."</p><p></p><p>Hearing this, the old butler forced a smile, then respectfully asked, "Sir, are you going to see the Soul Emperor? Let me guide you to the next realm."</p><p></p><p>His authority was not very high now, just a soul messenger captain. It would be very difficult for him to see the Soul Emperor.</p><p></p><p>The old butler had only seen the Soul Emperor once, about six hundred years ago, and never again since then.</p><p></p><p>Upon hearing this, Luchang Sheng's gaze remained calm as he smiled and said, "Me go see him? It should be him coming to see me."</p><p></p><p>The kneeling soul messengers were all shocked. This person is so arrogant... Does he not know how great the Soul Emperor is?</p><p></p><p>To actually say such audacious words.</p><p></p><p>After all, the Soul Realm is a highly special and independent realm, and the Soul Emperor's status is no less than the immortal emperors of the four directions. In some ways, it may even surpass them!</p><p></p><p>As Luchang Sheng's old servant, the old turtle immediately understood. He bowed to Luchang Sheng, then stepped forward, surveying the vast Soul Realm and shouting, "You foolish soul guardians, the master has descended upon your Soul Realm, yet you do not come to welcome him!"</p><p></p><p>The old butler and the soul messengers were dumbfounded... Calling them fools might not be very appropriate, right?</p><p></p><p>A voice like mighty ocean waves surged through the realm!</p><p></p><p>Instantly, the high-level administrators and various ghostly entities in the Soul Realm changed expressions. </p><p></p><p>How dare someone call the Soul Emperor a fool?</p><p></p><p>They were about to act with murderous intent.</p><p></p><p>But just then,</p><p></p><p>The powerful voice of the Soul Emperor boomed, "Attend to your duties, do not act rashly!"</p><p></p><p>Huh... Attend to your duties? Do not act rashly?</p><p></p><p>Hearing the Soul Emperor's cold words, </p><p></p><p>Those high-level entities who were about to attack immediately backed down, suppressing their shock and returning to their tasks...</p><p></p><p>Although they were inwardly puzzled, even with a thousand times the courage, they would not dare defy the Soul Emperor's order.</p><p></p><p>The Soul Emperor, who was always known for his fiery temper, was not even provoked when called a fool... This was truly a first.</p><p></p><p>...</p><p></p><p>Suddenly, a mighty middle-aged man in a black robe, with red hair and a single horn on his forehead, appeared!</p><p></p><p>"The Soul Emperor!" </p><p></p><p>The old butler and the soul messengers hurriedly bowed and addressed him with reverence.</p><p></p><p>As the Soul Emperor was now the old butler's highest superior, the old butler was truly fearful of him, especially his towering, ox-like physique, which was so imposing.</p><p></p><p>The Soul Emperor first glared at the old turtle, scolding, "You old turtle, you really don't give this emperor any face at all!"</p><p></p><p>The old turtle disdainfully snorted, but his eyes held a smile as he said, "What's wrong with calling you a fool? The master has been here for a while, if you were any slower, you might have been disciplined!"</p><p></p><p>The Soul Emperor chuckled at this, then took a deep breath. His domineering gaze finally fell upon the quietly standing young man in blue, and his eyes began to tremble.</p><p></p><p>Amidst the shocked gazes of all present, his towering figure slowly bent down, and he respectfully sighed with a smile,</p>

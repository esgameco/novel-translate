        <div class="content">
            <p>Here is the full English translation of the excerpt from the Chinese novel:</p><p></p><p>At this time, Song Ren looked at Han Yue and Ye Xiaoxiao and asked, "Xiaoxiao, Han Yue, have you communicated well with your parents? This servant will say one more thing, do not waste your talents! Possessing the Earth Martial Vein, you are among the best in the entire Star Luo Empire!"</p><p></p><p>"In response to the Servant, Han Yue has decided, following his heart."</p><p></p><p>"In response to the Servant, Xiaoxiao has also decided, not changing her will."</p><p></p><p>Soon, Han Yue and Ye Xiaoxiao bowed one after the other.</p><p></p><p>Behind them, the expressions of their respective parents were different.</p><p></p><p>Han Tie and Wu Cuilan didn't really mind, but Ye Jun and Zhong Fang were full of helplessness.</p><p></p><p>There was no way, they couldn't persuade their own daughter, Ye Xiaoxiao even said that even if they sent her to the Heavenly Martial Sect, she would find a way to sneak out... What else could they do?</p><p></p><p>Oh well, since the family conditions are not bad anyway, and Xiaoxiao is a girl, just let her be, who knows, she might be able to achieve something in the Dao of the Brush in the future.</p><p></p><p>The whole venue fell silent.</p><p></p><p>Cao Yulong, Huang Yulang, Huang Xuan and the others looked at Han Yue and Ye Xiaoxiao incomprehensibly.</p><p></p><p>Although they knew that Mr. Lu was a powerful master of the Dao of the Brush, the Dao of the Brush is not that easy!</p><p></p><p>This is clearly a very simple choice!</p><p></p><p>Moreover, Cao Yulong and Huang Yulang knew that except for them, no one in Jixiang Town knew about Lu Changsheng's powerful mastery of the Dao of the Brush, so what are these two children, as well as that Xiao Fan just now, aiming for?</p><p></p><p>Could it be that they really love the Dao of the Brush that much?</p><p></p><p>What a waste of talent!! Wasting the Earth Martial Vein, they all can't bear to watch!</p><p></p><p>Especially Cao Yulong, as the town lord, his own child doesn't have a martial vein, which is extremely regrettable!</p><p></p><p>Then look at these people, they have a martial vein, and it's the Earth Martial Vein, but they don't want to go to the Heavenly Martial Sect!</p><p></p><p>It's really a case of being thirsty to death in a drought and drowning in a flood!</p><p></p><p>Song Ren narrowed his eyes:</p><p></p><p>"Hehe, Han Yue, Xiaoxiao, possessing the Earth Martial Vein, whether you enter the Heavenly Martial Sect or not, is no longer up to you to decide! Such good talent, this servant will absolutely not allow you to waste it! Today, you will enter, whether you want to or not!!"</p><p></p><p>As the words fell, the faces of Han Yue and Ye Xiaoxiao turned pale, and they couldn't help but step back.</p><p></p><p>Their parents' expressions also changed slightly!</p><p></p><p>Han Tie hugged Han Yue to his chest and bravely said, "Servant, my family's Tiedan has his own path, can you... can you let him make his own decision?"</p><p></p><p>Outside Jixiang Town, it was now quiet, and everyone was watching this scene with a strange gaze.</p><p></p><p>Ah, they all wish they had a martial vein, but this Han Yue and Ye Xiaoxiao, possessing the Earth Martial Vein, still don't want to enter.</p><p></p><p>The Servant Song Ren cherishes their talents, and even wants to forcibly take these two back to the Heavenly Martial Sect.</p><p></p><p>This is the gap!</p><p></p><p>But everyone also realized that the Earth Martial Vein is truly precious.</p><p></p><p>For example, the ordinary martial vein of Xiao Fan, Servant Song didn't care, whether he entered or not.</p><p></p><p>"Do you know what the Earth Martial Vein means?"</p><p></p><p>Song Ren walked step by step towards Han Yue and Ye Xiaoxiao, but his gaze was on their two families.</p><p></p><p>"In the entire Star Luo Empire, with a population of over 10 billion, there are not more than a hundred people who possess the Earth Martial Vein!!"</p><p></p><p>"Do you know what this concept means?"</p><p></p><p>"The children don't understand, but you two families of elders don't understand either?"</p><p></p><p>"Isn't this self-destruction of one's future?!"</p><p></p><p>Over 10 billion people, and the Earth Martial Vein is not even a hundred!</p><p></p><p>Song Ren's words were like a huge stone thrown into a lake, causing massive waves!</p><p></p><p>Everyone was stunned!</p><p></p><p>They knew the Earth Martial Vein was precious, but they never imagined it to be this precious!</p><p></p><p>This is truly a rare and extraordinary thing!</p><p></p><p>The Star Luo Empire is vast, the towns are sparsely distributed, and their Jixiang Town has never seen the Earth Martial Vein before, so they didn't even know the preciousness of the Earth Martial Vein, and didn't even know of its existence.</p><p></p><p>And once the Earth Martial Vein appears, it will be...</p><p></p><p>Here is the full English translation of the Chinese excerpt:</p><p></p><p>The various sects had recruited and protected them with great care, only knowing the preciousness of the Earth Vein when they were detected in the towns.</p><p></p><p>"The children who possess the Earth Vein in the future are the hope of the Star Luo Empire! For them, it is also the opportunity of a lifetime to transform from a carp to a dragon!"</p><p></p><p>"Your parents do not understand, and the Executor does not blame you, but the Executor knows the importance of the Earth Vein and will never allow your own ignorance to bury the future of these children!"</p><p></p><p>Sung Ren's voice rang out forcefully.</p><p></p><p>Of course, he was speaking from the heart. His own performance was one thing, but this was about the sect, about Star Luo, and about the future of these children, which was the absolute truth.</p><p></p><p>Han Tie and the other parents had a grim expression on their faces. They now knew the importance of the Earth Vein and could see that this Executor Sung could not bear to see it, with a sense of helplessness and displeasure in his tone.</p><p></p><p>Just then!</p><p></p><p>A young man in blue robes stepped out from the side, standing between Han Yue and the others and Sung Ren.</p><p></p><p>"Sir... Sir!"</p><p>"Mr. Lu!"</p><p></p><p>The students and townspeople exclaimed.</p><p></p><p>This person was Lu Changsheng, who had appeared here at some unknown time.</p><p></p><p>At this moment, Lu Changsheng was still holding a dying big fish in his hand.</p><p></p><p>A straw was threaded through the fish's gills, the other end lightly hooked by Lu Changsheng's two fingers.</p><p></p><p>Sung Ren stopped in his tracks, examining the young man in front of him with a slightly puzzled gaze.</p><p></p><p>"Sir."</p><p></p><p>Han Yue and Ye Xiaoxiao bowed and called out.</p><p></p><p>Xiao Fan also rejoiced and ran over from the side, greeting him with a bow.</p><p></p><p>On the other side, Huang Xuan and the other eleven students had a slightly reddened complexion and lowered their heads.</p><p></p><p>They knew that their choice was in line with human nature, but for some reason, seeing the teacher, their hearts were still uneasy, feeling a little guilty.</p><p></p><p>Lu Changsheng nodded slightly, looking straight ahead and said, "Han Yue, Xiaoxiao, Xiao Fan, have you three made your decision?"</p><p></p><p>"As long as you have made your decision, then you will be my true students, Lu Changsheng."</p><p></p><p>"The rest of you need not worry, with me here, no one can take you away."</p><p></p><p>The calmness in the blue-robed man's tone, but the tyrannical aura, caused Sung Ren and the others from the Tian Wu Sect to be shocked in their hearts!</p><p></p><p>The townspeople were also dumbfounded, unable to believe that the gentle Mr. Lu they knew was this imposing young man who faced the Tian Wu Sect so calmly and with such domineering presence.</p><p></p><p>This stark contrast truly left them somewhat unable to react!</p><p></p><p>Only Cao Yulong, Huang Yulang, and the other two clan leaders sighed inwardly.</p><p></p><p>The taste is right, finally right!</p><p></p><p>That day when Mr. Lu descended from the sky, it was with this kind of bearing.</p><p></p><p>It's just that the people Mr. Lu is facing this time are different, they are the Tian Wu Sect, the number one sect in the Star Luo Empire!</p><p></p><p>Isn't Mr. Lu afraid of inviting the retaliation of the Tian Wu Sect?</p><p></p><p>Han Yue and the other three were stunned for a moment, seeing their teacher protecting them behind his back, facing the Tian Wu Sect so calmly, they couldn't help but feel their hot blood boiling. This was the teacher they had been dreaming of!</p><p></p><p>"Teacher, we have made our decision!!"</p><p></p><p>The three children of Han Yue bowed their bodies and said tremblingly.</p><p></p><p>Lu Changsheng nodded slightly, finally turning his gaze to the changing expression on Sung Ren's face and said softly, "You take the other children and leave, I don't hold it against you in your heart."</p><p></p><p>The scene fell silent, just as everyone was holding their breath, expecting Sung Ren to explode, they were amazed to see,</p><p></p><p>"Yes... yes."</p><p></p><p>Sung Ren bowed, drenched in sweat, his pupils slightly contracting.</p><p></p><p>His aura had been completely suppressed!</p><p></p><p>He had a strong intuition that if he dared to defy even a sentence, he would be doomed beyond redemption!</p><p></p><p>For the fastest updates on flawless novels, please visit www.feixs.com</p><p></p><p>For mobile access: https://m.feixs.com/chapter-45751-38225649</p>

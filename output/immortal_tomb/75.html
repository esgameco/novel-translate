        <h1>Chapter 75</h1>
        <div class="content">
            <p>Here is the full English translation of the Chinese excerpt:</p><p></p><p>Old Turtle let out a cold snort and disappeared into the sky, his face full of gloom. üò°üéÄÔºñ‚ûàùï§ùïôœÖ‚ìç.·ëïœÉÔº≠üêäüíö</p><p></p><p>Gulp, gulp...</p><p></p><p>The sound of swallowing saliva filled the heavens and earth.</p><p></p><p>The crowd looked up at the cloudless sky, still somewhat dazed, doubting whether they had just seen correctly - was the heavenly tribulation repelled by the old man's words?</p><p></p><p>When the old man first opened his mouth, they still chuckled. </p><p></p><p>But when his second sentence burst out, the heavenly tribulation disappeared with a whoosh. </p><p></p><p>This simply opened their eyes wide - when did the heavenly tribulation become something that could be repelled by words?</p><p></p><p>They vaguely remembered something about the old man's words regarding "my master"...</p><p></p><p>This was somewhat terrifying to ponder.</p><p></p><p>"Servant, should we still capture him...?" </p><p></p><p>From the Tian Yun Merchant Guild's group, a cultivator asked the two old men in front.</p><p></p><p>The two old men raised their eyebrows, feeling uncomfortable. </p><p></p><p>Because at this moment, countless strange gazes were falling upon them, as if waiting to see a good show.</p><p></p><p>"Old Six, forget it, the other party seems quite extraordinary, and you saw just now how that cultivator disappeared instantly in the sky - he must be a Transcendent Immortal Venerable, and this 'master' he mentioned is even more unimaginable... Anyway, since the heavenly tribulation didn't descend, there's no loss, so let's just call it off, shall we?"</p><p></p><p>One of the old men transmitted to the other.</p><p></p><p>Old Six stared at the Nameless Wine Hall, his eyes flickering, then swept his gaze across the crowd present, forcing a smile on his lips as he said loudly, </p><p></p><p>"Haha, since the heavenly tribulation didn't descend today, the Tian Yun Merchant Guild hasn't suffered any losses, so naturally we won't pursue this matter further. Everyone, you may disperse!"</p><p></p><p>After saying this, the two old men left with gloomy faces, leading their group of followers, eager to get away as soon as possible.</p><p></p><p>After they left, the cultivators present began to discuss heatedly.</p><p></p><p>"They left in such a hurry, the Tian Yun Merchant Guild is obviously intimidated."</p><p></p><p>"What can the Tian Yun Merchant Guild do? They are businessmen, concerned with benefits, and to go head-to-head with a Transcendent Immortal Venerable is of no benefit to them, so it's better to swallow their pride and cut their losses in time."</p><p></p><p>"Speaking of which, that Transcendent Immortal Venerable actually has a 'master' behind him... Repelling the heavenly tribulation, unprecedented, truly shocking. When did such a figure appear in the Spiritual Dust Realm?"</p><p></p><p>"Tch, in my opinion, it wasn't repelled. The heavenly tribulation's withdrawal must have other unknown reasons."</p><p></p><p>"Correct, fellow Daoist, I also don't think the heavenly tribulation was repelled."</p><p></p><p>"......"</p><p></p><p>The cultivators discussed animatedly, with most of them believing it was just a coincidence. </p><p></p><p>After all, in their subconscious, they couldn't bring themselves to believe that scene just now - if the heavenly tribulation could truly be repelled, their worldview would collapse.</p><p></p><p>.........</p><p></p><p>"Master, it's done."</p><p></p><p>Old Turtle returned to the pavilion, respectfully telling Lu Changsheng a sentence before sitting down and pouring himself a cup of wine, his expression gloomy.</p><p></p><p>Completely ignoring the bewildered Chu Xiran and Gu Helin.</p><p></p><p>Chu Xiran, recalling what she had just witnessed and heard, couldn't help but turn her gaze to Lu Changsheng with difficulty. "D-Daoist, aren't you afraid of being pursued by the Heavenly Dao?"</p><p></p><p>"Not afraid." Lu Changsheng said indifferently, then stood up and said, "We'll rest here at your wine hall for two days, and then you can come with us to the Western Regions."</p><p></p><p>Seeing Lu Changsheng stand up, Old Turtle and Gu Helin also hurriedly stood up.</p><p></p><p>The Western Regions?</p><p></p><p>Chu Xiran was startled, but quickly understood - this young man intends to make his move on the day the Immortal Ancestor of the Carefree Palace in the Western Regions ascends!</p><p></p><p>"Good, I will rely on the Daoist's help at that time!" </p><p></p><p>Chu Xiran also stood up, solemnly cupping her hands, ripples of joy surfacing in her eyes. She finally had the chance to return to the Four Directions Immortal Realm.</p><p></p><p>Lu Changsheng nodded, then prepared to leave the pavilion.</p><p></p><p>Here is the full English translation of the Chinese excerpt:</p><p></p><p>"Fellow Daoists, my name is Chu Xiruo. May I ask for your esteemed names?" Chu Xiruo asked with a smile.</p><p></p><p>The old turtle glanced at Lu Changsheng and then said inexplicably, "The master's name is Lu Changsheng, and as for me, you can just call me Turtle Daoist."</p><p></p><p>Lu Changsheng?! </p><p></p><p>Chu Xiruo's pupils shrank, and she was completely stunned.</p><p></p><p>Isn't this the honorable name of the Immortal Emperor of Longevity?</p><p></p><p>"Daoist... how come your name is..." Chu Xiruo hesitated to continue.</p><p></p><p>The old turtle waved his hand and frowned, "What's the big deal? The boundless Immortal Realms have countless living beings, so it's not that rare for my master to share the same name and surname as the Immortal Emperor of Longevity. Besides, I don't think the Immortal Emperor of Longevity has ever decreed any immortal rules saying that no one else can have the same name and surname as him. I see that you look quite pretty, why are you making such a fuss?"</p><p></p><p>Chu Xiruo felt relieved and replied with a smile, "My apologies."</p><p></p><p>Lu Changsheng remained silent, and the next moment, he disappeared from the scene along with the old turtle and the ancient crane.</p><p></p><p>Chu Xiruo shook her head. That's right, the Immortal Emperor of Longevity hasn't decreed any immortal rules, so there's nothing wrong with someone sharing the same name and surname as him.</p><p></p><p>However, what puzzled her was... the Immortal Emperor of Longevity may not have decreed any rules, but that doesn't mean anyone would dare to take the same name as him, right? There must be some taboo.</p><p></p><p>She knew that in the vast Immortal Realms, the bold ones who dare to take the same name as the Immortal Emperor are extremely few, especially among cultivators, who would be even more cautious about it. As for ordinary mortals taking the same name, that would be relatively normal.</p><p></p><p>But that young man and the old one were clearly not ordinary mortals...</p><p></p><p>"Ah, it seems that the Immortal Emperor of Longevity has been missing for too long, and many have lost their sense of awe towards him."</p><p></p><p>Chu Xiruo sighed, and the Lu Changsheng who shared the same name as the Immortal Emperor was probably the same.</p><p></p><p>"But the Immortal Emperor of Longevity..."</p><p></p><p>Chu Xiruo murmured again, her gaze hazy.</p><p></p><p>She was just a minor Immortal, with a lifespan of only 30,000 years.</p><p></p><p>While the Immortal Emperor of Longevity had been missing from the Immortal Realms for over a million years...</p><p></p><p>No one knew whether he was alive or dead.</p><p></p><p>As time ruthlessly passed, many in the Immortal Realms had long forgotten the once peerlessly magnificent Immortal Emperor of Longevity.</p><p></p><p>The four remaining Immortal Emperors who still existed in the Immortal Realms, after experiencing millions of years, also seemed to have limited lifespans left.</p><p></p><p>For some reason, news about these four Immortal Emperors was also rarely heard these days.</p><p></p><p>...</p><p></p><p>"Kid, what are you spacing out for?" </p><p></p><p>In the room, the old turtle scolded the ancient crane.</p><p></p><p>"Huh?" The ancient crane snapped out of his daze and smiled awkwardly. "Senior Turtle, the crane is not spacing out."</p><p></p><p>His mind was currently a jumbled mess - the blocked ascension portal, the Immortal Realms, the Immortal Emperor of Longevity, and so on. </p><p></p><p>When would the conflict between the Demon and Immortal Realms erupt? There were just too many complicated matters...</p><p></p><p>"Oh right, Senior Turtle, when we were observing the ascension tribulation in the Western Regions, the Demon and Immortal Realms won't take the opportunity to start a war, will they?"</p><p></p><p>Thinking about this, the ancient crane suddenly stood up.</p><p></p><p>The old turtle glanced at him meaningfully and said, "Some things, if you can't understand them, don't try to think about them. Just let things take their course."</p><p></p><p>The old turtle turned around and continued, "As for the Demon and Immortal Realms starting a war, that's your own business. I'm sure you've realized by now that my master and I are from the Immortal Realms."</p><p></p><p>"Although my master is from the 'Human Realm', that doesn't mean he has to get involved. There are countless worlds like your Spiritual Dust Realm, and my master can't take care of them all. As long as you, the kid, and your turtle grandpa maintain a good relationship with my master, it'll be a piece of cake."</p><p></p><p>The ancient crane was stunned again, his worldview infinitely expanded. There are actually countless worlds like the Spiritual Dust Realm...</p>

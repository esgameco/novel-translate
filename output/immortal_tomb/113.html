        <h1>Chapter 113</h1>
        <div class="content">
            <p>Here is the full English translation of the Chinese excerpt:</p><p></p><p>On the city wall, the wind howled. ‚ô°‚ô¢‚ûÖ‚ùæ‡∏£ƒßùïåùîµ.‚í∏√ò·µêüëåüí¢</p><p></p><p>The group of elders from the Heavenly Mechanism Pavilion finally regained their composure, taking a deep breath to calm their racing hearts. They then straightened their robes and followed Nangong Jing.</p><p></p><p>"Nangong Jing, leading the elders of the Heavenly Mechanism Pavilion... pays respects to the Immortal Emperor of Longevity."</p><p></p><p>Nangong Jing bowed respectfully and was about to lead the group of elders to kneel down.</p><p></p><p>Lu Changsheng smiled faintly and interrupted, "No need for such formalities, please be seated."</p><p></p><p>Nangong Jing and the others paused, then sat down on their knees in front of Lu Changsheng.</p><p></p><p>The atmosphere fell silent. The group of elders, who usually held high positions, were now bowing their heads, very reserved.</p><p></p><p>Nangong Jing glanced at the old tortoise, then his gaze lingered on Lu Changsheng for a moment before he lowered his head, as if letting out a sigh of relief.</p><p></p><p>"Immortal Emperor, after a million years, you... have finally returned."</p><p></p><p>Lu Changsheng picked up the gourd and took a sip, then smiled mysteriously, "Judging by your reaction, you must know where I've been these past million years?"</p><p></p><p>Nangong Jing shook his head and said respectfully, "Nangong could never know the heavenly secrets related to the Immortal Emperor."</p><p></p><p>Lu Changsheng looked up at the frozen palace in the sky and said, "Precisely because the Immortal Emperor's heavenly secrets are so difficult to discern, you immediately thought of me, since those four fellows don't have the time to deal with such trivial matters."</p><p></p><p>Nangong Jing was silent for a moment, then suddenly said, "The other four Immortal Emperors' lifespans are about to end, with the longest only having ten thousand years left. But you, Immortal Emperor, still have an abundant and vigorous life force, truly living up to your title of the Immortal of Longevity."</p><p></p><p>Lu Changsheng gave him a sidelong glance and chuckled lightly, "What are you implying by bringing up the lifespans of those four fellows?"</p><p></p><p>"Immortal Emperor, Nangong believes that with your abilities, you must already know about the obstruction on the Divine Path by the Ancestral Heavenly Realm. And Nangong has calculated that a great calamity is about to descend upon the Immortal Realm... the Immortal Emperors don't have much time left."</p><p></p><p>Nangong Jing spoke directly.</p><p></p><p>The old tortoise was taken aback. He was not surprised to hear about the Divine Path, as he had already known about it and even fought with the people from the Divine Path before. But a great calamity? What was that?</p><p></p><p>However, he did not immediately raise any doubts. He knew that the Heavenly Mechanism Pavilion would not say such things lightly, as they were experts in this field.</p><p></p><p>Lu Changsheng looked at Nangong Jing and said, "Your lifespan is not long, is it? It's because of this, isn't it?"</p><p></p><p>Nangong Jing smiled calmly and said, "This is the responsibility of every generation of Pavilion Masters. Nangong is grateful that after a million years, you, Immortal Emperor, have finally appeared. This way, the Immortal Realm will have a chance to face the great calamity."</p><p></p><p>Lu Changsheng nodded, not saying anything further. As the Immortal Emperor of Longevity in the Central Immortal Realm, he had an obligation to help the Immortal Realm in times of crisis.</p><p></p><p>"Immortal Emperor, may you accompany Nangong to the Heavenly Mechanism Pavilion? Some of the content Nangong has calculated has been recorded on the Heavenly Mechanism Mirror." Nangong Jing asked respectfully.</p><p></p><p>"Alright." Lu Changsheng agreed.</p><p></p><p>Seeing this, Nangong Jing felt relieved. He led the group of elders to stand up.</p><p></p><p>Immediately, a simple imperial carriage was summoned, inviting Lu Changsheng and the old tortoise to board.</p><p></p><p>In a flash,</p><p></p><p>the imperial carriage disappeared from the city wall.</p><p></p><p>The frozen crystal palace in the sky remained, as if it had existed since ancient times.</p><p></p><p>.........</p><p></p><p>The Sweeping Yang Immortal Realm's Inspection Headquarters had been frozen, and all the personnel, from the Copper Plate Inspectors to the Immortal King-level Headquarters Masters, had perished.</p><p></p><p>This news was spreading like wildfire, not only in the Sweeping Yang Immortal Realm, but also in the Chaotic Star Immortal Realm and the Martial Immortal Realm.</p><p></p><p>The three major Immortal Realms were already in a state of turmoil...</p><p></p><p>Here is the full English translation of the excerpt from the Chinese novel:</p><p></p><p>The boundless expanse - it shows just how fierce the speed of transmission can be!</p><p></p><p>New 69 Book Bar 99 üÖ¢üÖóüÖ§üÖß.üÖíüÖûüÖú</p><p></p><p>This matter is so shockingly significant, for no other reason than the fact that the Patrol Palace is directly subordinate to the power of the Southern Immortal Realm Immortal Emperor Palace.</p><p></p><p>It's unimaginable - who could possibly have the audacious courage to dare to lay a hand on the forces directly subordinate to the Immortal Emperor Palace?</p><p></p><p>The implications behind this are truly chilling to ponder.</p><p></p><p>The Southern Immortal Realm is composed of the three great immortal continents of Fuyang, Luanxing, and Diwu, and the Immortal Emperor Palace is situated right at the center, surrounded by these three great immortal continents.</p><p></p><p>The Immortal Emperor Palace, in all its resplendent glory, stands tall in this location. A single imperial palace alone is larger than numerous mortal realms combined. It is the pinnacle of the vast Southern Immortal Realm, commanding and intimidating the entire Southern Immortal Realm!</p><p></p><p>And the lord of the Immortal Emperor Palace is the supreme ruler of the Southern Immortal Realm, the Yin-Yang Immortal Emperor, the ancient Yin-Yang.</p><p></p><p>At this moment, within the resplendent Immortal Emperor Palace.</p><p></p><p>Many figures are kneeling on the ground, paying the utmost respect.</p><p></p><p>Above the palace, a Yin-Yang light figure slowly rotates, the overwhelming imperial might pressing down like a primordial fierce beast, suffocating the vast hall.</p><p></p><p>"We pay our respects to the Yin-Yang Immortal Emperor!!"</p><p></p><p>The figures struggle to endure the imperial might, respectfully calling out.</p><p></p><p>In the next moment, the imperial might in the hall suddenly dissipates completely, and the people let out a huge sigh of relief.</p><p></p><p>Then, a somewhat hoarse and weary voice comes from the Yin-Yang light figure above,</p><p></p><p>"Speak directly about the matter at hand, I have little leisure time."</p><p></p><p>After a moment of silence, one person steps forward to report,</p><p></p><p>"Immortal Emperor, a few days ago, a great event occurred at the Patrol Palace in the Fuyang Immortal Continent. The entire palace was mysteriously encased in ice, and everyone from the patrol envoys to the Golden Yang Immortal King were all wiped out of existence..."</p><p></p><p>"Oh? Have you investigated it thoroughly?" The Yin-Yang Immortal Emperor seems slightly puzzled by this incident.</p><p></p><p>Hearing the Immortal Emperor's question, the people tremble.</p><p></p><p>"Immortal Emperor, when we arrived, the Patrol Palace had already met with disaster. We collected evidence at the scene and even questioned the local cultivators, but no one knew what had happened..."</p><p></p><p>The Yin-Yang light figure falls silent, with only the Yin-Yang bagua rotating slowly.</p><p></p><p>Seeing this, the people lower their heads even further, filled with trepidation.</p><p></p><p>"I am not in the Southern Immortal Realm at the moment, so you all handle this matter. You can go to the Divination Pavilion in the Diwu Immortal Continent and have the elders there calculate the culprit. Once you've identified the mastermind, report back to me."</p><p></p><p>The Yin-Yang light figure's words fade, gradually dissipating, but then it suddenly speaks again,</p><p></p><p>"Oh, and when you go to the Divination Pavilion, don't try to throw around the Immortal Emperor Palace's weight, especially with the Pavilion Master. Even I, the Immortal Emperor, would show him some courtesy, understand?"</p><p></p><p>The people hurriedly respond, "Yes!"</p><p></p><p>The Yin-Yang light figure then completely disappears...</p><p></p><p>"Phew~~~"</p><p></p><p>The people let out a long sigh of relief, one by one straightening up.</p><p></p><p>"For these tens of thousands of years, it seems the Immortal Emperor has often been absent from the Southern Immortal Realm..."</p><p></p><p>"Hmm, I suppose something must have happened..."</p><p></p><p>"Of course, though we don't know what exactly, it's definitely related to that Ancestral Celestial Realm. The lifespans of the Four Great Immortal Emperors are dwindling, and they're still lingering in the Four Immortal Realms. What do you all think?"</p><p></p><p>"..."</p><p></p><p>Hearing this, the people fall silent.</p><p></p><p>As the high-ranking members of the Immortal Emperor Palace and the Immortal Emperor's direct subordinates, they naturally know about the Ancestral Celestial Realm.</p><p></p><p>"Ah, everyone, let's not dwell on that for now. Before anything else, we should go to the Divination Pavilion in the Diwu Immortal Continent and get to the bottom of the Patrol Palace incident. With the Immortal Emperor absent, we must handle this properly. Let's see who has the audacity to provoke the Immortal Emperor Palace!"</p>

        <h1>Chapter 138</h1>
        <div class="content">
            <p>Here is the full English translation of the Chinese excerpt:</p><p></p><p>The words of Lu Changsheng fell. üéâüí¢‚ùª‚ûàùê¨ƒ§√π‚ìç.¬¢œåŒú‚ôïüéÖ</p><p></p><p>The Snow Ball Clan Chief and Snow Tower looked at each other in shock, and they finally both turned to look at the calm and unruffled Lu Changsheng in front of them.</p><p></p><p>"Fellow Daoist, why are you so confident?" the Snow Ball Clan Chief asked with a flickering gaze.</p><p></p><p>The old turtle saw this and impatiently growled, "Whatever my master says, that's how it is. You don't need to doubt it. Are you going to follow along to the Ancestral Heavenly Realm or not? A rare opportunity is right in front of you, yet you're dilly-dallying!"</p><p></p><p>Lu Changsheng, however, looked at the old turtle with a slight surprise, puzzled by how this fellow had become so straightforward today.</p><p></p><p>The Snow Ball Clan Chief no longer asked further questions and solemnly said, "Since that is the case, then the Clan Chief will no longer hesitate. We will rely on you, Fellow Daoist, on the divine path."</p><p></p><p>Lu Changsheng nodded and looked at Snow Tower, asking, "Is it just you and him from the Snow Ball Clan going to the divine path?"</p><p></p><p>The Snow Ball Clan Chief slowly said, "No, the Clan Chief will go with you to the divine path to help, but the only one going to the Ancestral Heavenly Realm is Snow Tower."</p><p></p><p>Upon hearing this, Snow Tower was slightly taken aback and asked, "Clan Chief, why are you not going to the Ancestral Heavenly Realm?"</p><p></p><p>After all, the Snow Ball Clan Chief's strength had also reached the peak of the Four Directions Immortal Realm. If he wanted to advance further, he would have to go to the Ancestral Heavenly Realm.</p><p></p><p>Chu Lingtian and the others were also slightly surprised and did not understand what the Snow Ball Clan Chief meant.</p><p></p><p>The Snow Ball Clan Chief turned his back, listening to the playful noises outside, and smiled, "You all don't need to be puzzled. The aspirations of all living beings are diverse, and it's not that everyone always wants to become stronger. As the Clan Chief, I only wish to stay in the Snow Ball Clan and be with the little ones every day."</p><p></p><p>"Moreover, the lifespan of our Snow Ball Clan is already quite long, which is enough."</p><p></p><p>Hearing this, Chu Lingtian and the others nodded in understanding.</p><p></p><p>Their aspirations were to continue becoming stronger, because only by becoming stronger would they have a chance to obtain the elusive immortality!</p><p></p><p>Unlike the ancient Yinyang in their group, who had only a few months of lifespan left.</p><p></p><p>"Alright, then you all prepare yourselves. I'll give you three days' time," Lu Changsheng said with a faint smile.</p><p></p><p>The Snow Ball Clan Chief nodded gratefully and then instructed, "Snow Tower, please take our Fellow Daoists to the guest room to rest."</p><p></p><p>"Yes."</p><p></p><p>...</p><p></p><p>In the guest room.</p><p></p><p>Lu Changsheng sat in the main seat, with Chu Lingtian and the others seated on the sides.</p><p></p><p>Lu Changsheng called out, "Lingtian, Feng Nine, Yinyang, Wushi."</p><p></p><p>"Here." The four of them immediately stood up, even making the old turtle stand up with a resigned expression.</p><p></p><p>"You don't need to be so nervous. Just sit down and we can talk," Lu Changsheng said with a light laugh.</p><p></p><p>"Understood." The group sat back down.</p><p></p><p>"Although I didn't mention any conditions to the Snow Ball Clan Chief earlier, you all have lived for quite some time, and you should be able to understand that if you encounter exclusion in the Ancestral Heavenly Realm, with the divine path as your guide, Snow Tower and his ancestors will definitely not sit idly by."</p><p></p><p>Lu Changsheng spoke softly.</p><p></p><p>Chu Lingtian and the others were slightly stunned, but then they all nodded. They naturally understood this reasoning.</p><p></p><p>Chu Lingtian smiled and said, "Immortal Emperor Changsheng, don't worry. In the past, several Immortal Emperors from our Five Great Immortal Realms have ascended to the Ancestral Heavenly Realm. After so many years, they should have gained some status and influence there. At worst, we four can go find them for help."</p><p></p><p>"Haha, yes, with this in mind, I'm not as anxious anymore. Our Five Great Immortal Realms should have some footing in the Ancestral Heavenly Realm," Shi Wushi said with a simple smile while scratching his head.</p><p></p><p>Hearing this, Lu Changsheng suddenly burst out laughing.</p><p></p><p>Huh?</p><p></p><p>Seeing Lu Changsheng's meaningful smile, Chu Lingtian and the others were a bit confused. They didn't think they had said anything wrong.</p><p></p><p>However, due to their respect for Lu Changsheng and their unconditional trust in him, they did not choose to refute, but instead waited patiently for him to continue.</p><p></p><p>Lu Changsheng swept his gaze across them and spoke unhurriedly, "If the Immortal Emperors who previously ascended to the Ancestral Heavenly Realm were truly doing well there, then why is it that when the divine path is now obstructed and the Five Great Immortal Realms are facing difficulties, we do not see the appearance or aid of those former Immortal Emperors? So... either they are not doing well, or even... they may have perished."</p><p></p><p>Here is the full English translation of the Chinese excerpt:</p><p></p><p>"Who knows?" </p><p></p><p>Chu Lingian and the others tensed up!</p><p></p><p>New 69 Book Bar ‚Üí 69shu.com</p><p></p><p>They had nothing to say. Although Luchang Sheng's words were a bit direct, it was very likely the case.</p><p></p><p>Seeing them dazed, Luchang Sheng waved his hand and said, "Anyway, prepare yourselves mentally. Go and rest, and in three days, I will send you up there."</p><p></p><p>The group stood up, slightly bowed, and left.</p><p></p><p>After the group left, the old turtle looked at Luchang Sheng solemnly and asked, "Master, were your words just now true?"</p><p></p><p>Luchang Sheng glanced at him and replied indifferently, "What do you think?"</p><p></p><p>"Then won't it be very difficult for Lingian and the others up there?" the old turtle frowned.</p><p></p><p>After all, they had a relationship of nearly ten million years, and the old turtle felt somewhat pained.</p><p></p><p>"What can be done about it? Among them, the one with the longest lifespan has only ten thousand years left, and the shortest only has a few months. It's still better than waiting for death in the Four Directions Immortal Realm," Luchang Sheng continued indifferently.</p><p></p><p>"To break through the circle, the only way is to become stronger."</p><p></p><p>.........</p><p></p><p>Three days later.</p><p></p><p>At the peak of the snow mountain.</p><p></p><p>Luchang Sheng and the others, as well as six snow people, stood there.</p><p></p><p>"Uncle Snow Tower, are you really leaving...?" </p><p></p><p>The four treasures surrounded the Snow Tower, reluctant to part.</p><p></p><p>Snow Tower chuckled, "Yes, your uncle is leaving, but the Clan Leader will always be with you in the future."</p><p></p><p>"Alright! You four rascals, hurry back! While I, the Clan Leader, am not back, you are not allowed to play around!" the Snow Ball Clan Leader scolded in a low voice, afraid that Luchang Sheng and the others would get impatient.</p><p></p><p>The four snow people were frightened and quickly retreated into the cave.</p><p></p><p>"Haha, sorry about that, fellow Daoist, these little ones, haha..." </p><p></p><p>The Snow Ball Clan Leader smiled awkwardly but politely.</p><p></p><p>"No problem, let's set off," Luchang Sheng said with a smile.</p><p></p><p>"Fellow Daoist, the Divine Path is extremely distant, I'm afraid it will take us quite some time to get there," the Snow Ball Clan Leader said with a wry smile.</p><p></p><p>But there was no helping it.</p><p></p><p>"Ah, don't worry about that, with the master here, we'll reach the Divine Path in just a moment!" the old turtle said proudly, as if it was his own ability.</p><p></p><p>Luchang Sheng did not say anything further. He waved his hand, and a black portal appeared, then he took the lead and walked in.</p><p></p><p>Next were Chu Lingian and the others, and finally, the old turtle looked at the perplexed Snow Tower and Snow Ball Clan Leader and said, "Let's go, what are you standing there for? Don't worry, we'll be at the Divine Path in a flash."</p><p></p><p>With that, he dragged them into the black portal.</p><p></p><p>The black portal suddenly disappeared from the peak of the snow mountain.</p><p></p><p>.........</p><p></p><p>In a certain place in the Four Directions Immortal Realm, the sky and earth were vast and bleak, with the solemn sound of the Dao echoing.</p><p></p><p>There was a hazy path leading to an unknown place, which seemed to have been tilted between heaven and earth since ancient times.</p><p></p><p>On the desolate stone plain, the black portal suddenly appeared out of nowhere.</p><p></p><p>The young man in blue robes stepped out first, slightly tilting his head to look at the majestic hazy path, without uttering a word.</p><p></p><p>When the black portal disappeared, the rest had all come out.</p><p></p><p>"This... This is the Divine Path!! In just a few breaths, we've gone from my Snow Ball Clan's territory to the Divine Path??" </p><p></p><p>The Snow Ball Clan Leader and Snow Tower looked up at the sky, then said in shock.</p><p></p><p>Just a few breaths... This was an unimaginable speed. If one excludes the time it took to enter and exit the black portal, it would be no exaggeration to say that they arrived with just a thought.</p><p></p><p>They finally saw a glimpse of the young man in blue robes' true power!</p><p></p><p>It was truly unfathomable!</p><p></p><p>"Tch, making a big fuss over nothing!" the old turtle mocked.</p><p></p><p>Chu Lingian and the others looked up at the familiar Divine Path, their eyes flickering.</p><p></p><p>They had failed here many times before.</p><p></p><p>On the Divine Path, there were countless unpredictable dangers, and at the end, there were also powerful experts from the Ancestral Heaven Divine Realm blocking the way!!!</p><p></p><p>At this moment, they saw Luchang Sheng tidy up his sleeves, then put his hands behind his back and walk towards the entrance of the Divine Path unhurriedly.</p><p></p><p>They heard him say,</p><p></p><p>"Follow me."</p>

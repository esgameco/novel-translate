        <h1>Chapter 3</h1>
        <div class="content">
            <p>Here is the full English translation of the Chinese excerpt:</p><p></p><p>In the town of Moyu, it was quite lively. ·É¶(¬Ø`‚óï‚Äø‚óï¬¥¬Ø) ‚ô´ ‚ô™ ‚ô´ ‚ùª‚ùæùìàùíΩùêî–ñ.œÇœÉùî™ ‚ô´ ‚ô™ ‚ô´ (¬Ø`‚óï‚Äø‚óï¬¥¬Ø)·É¶</p><p></p><p>Even though the sun was blazing hot at this time, there were still quite a few vendors along the streets shouting and sweating profusely.</p><p></p><p>Lu Changsheng strolled along with his hands behind his back, occasionally stopping at this stall or that one to take a look.</p><p></p><p>Whenever the vendors got excited, thinking that business was coming, they would find that the young man in the blue robe had already moved on to the next stall...</p><p></p><p>This went on repeatedly.</p><p></p><p>If it weren't for the extraordinary bearing of the young man in the blue robe, as if he were someone important, the vendors would have long since turned their backs on him!</p><p></p><p>What kind of entertainment is this?</p><p></p><p>Finally, Lu Changsheng entered a small tavern.</p><p></p><p>The waiter, seeing Lu Changsheng, immediately narrowed his eyes. This was clearly a scholar or some other important person, not an ordinary person, so he hurriedly went forward to greet him!</p><p></p><p>"Sir, are you...?"</p><p></p><p>Before the waiter could finish speaking, Lu Changsheng lightly sniffed the air and smiled, "Is that peach blossom wine?"</p><p></p><p>The waiter hurriedly agreed, "Sir, you clearly know your wines. This is indeed peach blossom wine."</p><p></p><p>"Good, then bring me a pot of peach blossom wine. As for the dishes, you can just bring whatever you think is good."</p><p></p><p>Lu Changsheng said this and then walked towards the window seat, under the astonished gaze of the other patrons in the tavern.</p><p></p><p>"Yes, sir, please wait a moment." The waiter quickly retreated to prepare.</p><p></p><p>...</p><p></p><p>In the lord's manor of Moyu Town.</p><p></p><p>The steward rushed into the main hall, joyfully saying:</p><p></p><p>"Lord! The people downstairs have reported that another extraordinary young man has entered Moyu Town!"</p><p></p><p>Only to see a middle-aged man sitting and drinking tea in the hall suddenly put down his teacup and stand up, exclaiming in delight, "Oh? Where is he?"</p><p></p><p>The middle-aged man was dressed in elegant attire, with a square face. </p><p></p><p>He was the lord of Moyu Town, Chen Dadao.</p><p></p><p>The steward wryly smiled, "Lord, the people downstairs didn't follow him. Didn't you say that if such people appear, we shouldn't rashly pursue them?"</p><p></p><p>Chen Dadao slapped his forehead and laughed, "That's right, look at the lord forgetting."</p><p></p><p>Chen Dadao was now both delighted and anxious.</p><p></p><p>Delighted that another such person had come to Moyu Town, giving him another chance!</p><p></p><p>Anxious that this person might be like the previous few, just appearing extraordinary on the surface, but actually just an ordinary person.</p><p></p><p>Chen Dadao had a long-cherished dream - to cultivate immortality!</p><p></p><p>Although immortals and mortals are different, it is very rare to see immortals in the mortal world, but he had been so fortunate as to see one once!</p><p></p><p>Just that one time, and he was completely captivated, that carefree and unrestrained spirit of flying and escaping the mundane deeply attracted him...</p><p></p><p>He yearned for the day when he too could be like that, and more importantly, he knew that immortals live far longer than mortals...</p><p></p><p>Whether the young man who had entered the town was an immortal, Chen Dadao believed that a single glance would tell him!</p><p></p><p>After all, he had witnessed the bearing of an immortal!</p><p></p><p>The steward, being Chen Dadao's closest subordinate, naturally understood what Chen Dadao was thinking at the moment, so he smiled and said, "Lord, what shall we do now?"</p><p></p><p>To be honest, if it was possible, he too wanted to cultivate immortality, even though he had never seen the mysterious immortals before, but based on Chen Dadao's descriptions, they were certainly not fake.</p><p></p><p>Moreover, the far eastern region of their domain was said to have the existence of immortal tombs...</p><p></p><p>Hearing this, Chen Dadao pondered and said, "Moyu Town is not that big... Alright, you and I will go out in disguise and try to find that person."</p><p></p><p>The steward nodded, naturally knowing that Chen Dadao wanted to go out in disguise so as not to be recognized by the townspeople, and then frowned and asked, "But Lord, what if..."</p><p></p><p>Here is the full English translation of the excerpt from the Chinese novel:</p><p></p><p>"Master, if that person is truly an immortal... what should we do next?" </p><p></p><p>Chen Dadao paused, waving his hand and saying, "If he is truly an immortal, we should naturally cater to his preferences and flatter him well. But whether he is one or not, it's still too early to say for sure."</p><p></p><p>Chen Dadao took a deep breath, his eyes revealing a glimmer of hope as he continued, "Anyway, we shouldn't delay. Let's change our attire, put on some concealing hats, and go look for him!"</p><p></p><p>"Yes."</p><p></p><p>...</p><p></p><p>In the small tavern, by the window.</p><p></p><p>Lu Changsheng held the wine cup in his hand, and his eyes flickered briefly. He then saw the wine in the cup gradually emit a chilly air, becoming ice-cold.</p><p></p><p>He then lifted the wine cup and took a light sip. On this scorching hot day, the cool peach blossom wine flowing down his throat was truly delightful.</p><p></p><p>Of course, he was not afraid of the heat, he just wanted to have a sense of ritual.</p><p></p><p>Lu Changsheng savored the floral aroma of the wine in his nose, the corners of his mouth curling up slightly.</p><p></p><p>Perhaps this peach blossom wine was not particularly outstanding, but at this moment, it was an exquisite vintage for Lu Changsheng.</p><p></p><p>The reason was simple - this was the first sip of wine he had after emerging from the immortal's tomb, after who knows how long.</p><p></p><p>"Sir, the dishes have arrived."</p><p></p><p>At this time, the waiter placed several steaming hot dishes on the table and said with a smile, "By the way, sir, the boss said this meal is on the house."</p><p></p><p>"Please enjoy your meal, sir."</p><p></p><p>The waiter bowed slightly and left.</p><p></p><p>Lu Changsheng's hand holding the wine cup paused momentarily upon hearing this. He glanced at the smiling boss standing at the counter, nodding in greeting.</p><p></p><p>From the gate guard just now to the tavern boss at the moment, everyone was being unusually polite to him.</p><p></p><p>He looked at his own reflection in the wine cup, his transcendent countenance, and sighed slightly, feeling a bit helpless.</p><p></p><p>He had already restrained all the various auras and energies he naturally exuded.</p><p></p><p>Yet, he was still too outstanding.</p><p></p><p>It had always been this way, and he could do nothing about it.</p><p></p><p>He naturally would not deliberately conceal his inherent aura, as that would seem a bit affected.</p><p></p><p>"Sigh."</p><p></p><p>Lu Changsheng sighed lightly, raising his cup and looking out the window, his gaze a bit distant as he pondered the matter of the immortal's tomb.</p><p></p><p>At the same time,</p><p></p><p>"Lord Prefect, the villagers are looking at us rather strangely..."</p><p></p><p>Feeling the many curious gazes, the steward said in a somewhat embarrassed low voice, glancing at his and Chen Dadao's attire, and pursing his lips.</p><p></p><p>On this scorching hot day, the two of them were wrapped up tightly, looking like a pair of lunatics, so the villagers' strange looks were understandable.</p><p></p><p>"Ahem, great men are not bound by small matters. It's quite hot, ah, let's go to that small tavern and quench our thirst first."</p><p></p><p>Chen Dadao said, almost fleeing towards the tavern.</p><p></p><p>Seeing this, the steward's mouth twitched slightly, quickly following behind.</p><p></p><p>...</p><p></p><p>"You two gentlemen, are you..." </p><p></p><p>The waiter hadn't finished speaking when the steward interrupted, "Just bring us two pots of peach blossom wine, quickly."</p><p></p><p>"Haha, okay, you two gentlemen can find a seat first, the peach blossom wine will be up shortly."</p><p></p><p>The waiter looked at their attire and chuckled, quickly going downstairs.</p><p></p><p>"Lord Prefect, would you like to sit by the window or a bit more to the side...?"</p><p></p><p>The steward asked in a low voice, but found that Chen Dadao did not respond. Puzzled, he turned around: "Lord Prefect?"</p><p></p><p>The steward was soon taken aback, for he saw that Chen Dadao's eyes under the concealing hat were fixed intently in one direction!</p><p></p><p>The steward couldn't help but follow his gaze, his pupils also constricting in surprise!</p><p></p><p>There, by the window, sat a young man of transcendent bearing, quietly drinking his wine.</p><p></p><p>In an instant, the steward knew that this was likely the one they were looking for.</p>

        <h1>Chapter 88</h1>
        <div class="content">
            <p>Here is the full English translation of the Chinese excerpt:</p><p></p><p>Spiritual Dust Realm. ‚úéüéâ‚ûÖÔºôùì¢ùìó‚ì§x.ÂåöùëúùìÇüéÉüíú</p><p></p><p>Eastern Domain.</p><p></p><p>Not only the Lishui and other empires, many places in the Eastern Domain have also experienced war.</p><p></p><p>Wave after wave of merciless beast tides ravaged the land.</p><p></p><p>If it were not for all the sects of the Eastern Domain's cultivation world mobilizing, the casualties would have reached a horrifying degree.</p><p></p><p>However, since the Eastern Domain did not prepare its defenses in advance, even though they reacted in time, the casualties were already severe.</p><p></p><p>"A few years ago, the Azure Cloud Sect had already warned about this, but no one believed them. Now look, the Eastern Domain has suffered tremendous losses! So many common people have died, including many with spiritual roots. In the coming period, the sects of the Eastern Domain will fall into decline and be left far behind by the other domains!"</p><p></p><p>"What's the use of saying this now? It's better to quickly exterminate the demonic beasts and minimize the losses. The Five Great Demonic Kings of the Demon Realm are sweeping all before them, practically unstoppable. Where is the Purple Extreme Thunder Peak? As the hegemon of our Eastern Domain, why are we not seeing any of their people!"</p><p></p><p>"Ah, I don't know. If the Purple Extreme Thunder Peak doesn't act, the Eastern Domain will surely fall."</p><p></p><p>"Damn it... at a time like this, what the hell is the Purple Extreme Thunder Peak doing!"</p><p></p><p>"......"</p><p></p><p>Countless regrets, urgency, doubts and curses reverberated throughout the Eastern Domain.</p><p></p><p>Meanwhile.</p><p></p><p>The capital of the Lishui Empire.</p><p></p><p>"Roar!!"</p><p></p><p>The terrifying beast roar shook heaven and earth, causing countless buildings to collapse. The ground was dyed crimson with fresh blood, with corpses strewn everywhere.</p><p></p><p>The severed heads, limbs, eyeballs, and various other dismembered remains left by the demonic beasts were a horrifying sight.</p><p></p><p>The pungent stench of blood madly invaded the nostrils, assaulting everyone's senses.</p><p></p><p>"Disciples, follow this Elder to slay them!" </p><p></p><p>"Yes!"</p><p></p><p>An Elder from the Azure Cloud Sect led a group of disciples to battle the horde of beasts.</p><p></p><p>Each strike was earth-shaking, with blood spraying in all directions - a truly brutal scene.</p><p></p><p>"Immortal, save us!!!"</p><p></p><p>The King of Lishui, along with a group of officials and palace beauties, kowtowed on the ground, their faces filled with terror.</p><p></p><p>The terrifying demonic beast tide had suddenly attacked, killing and injuring countless citizens in the capital in an instant. At this rate, their capital would be destroyed.</p><p></p><p>Boom!!</p><p></p><p>Lin Dong smashed the demonic beast in front of him with his staff, then turned around and impatiently shouted,</p><p></p><p>"All of you, shut up! The Second Elder and his disciples are still out there exterminating the demons. You'd better stay put obediently. Say one more word, and I'll feed you to the beasts!"</p><p></p><p>The King of Lishui and the officials dared not speak another word.</p><p></p><p>Lin Dong snorted coldly, looking at the raging battle scene, his eyes losing focus.</p><p></p><p>The sudden invasion of the demonic beasts was so unexpected. Now... the entire Eastern Domain was plunged into a brutal war.</p><p></p><p>Demonic beasts were everywhere, infiltrating every corner.</p><p></p><p>Lin Dong did not know where his father was at the moment...</p><p></p><p>"Roar!"</p><p></p><p>Suddenly, a beast roar interrupted Lin Dong's thoughts. He saw a dozen or so ordinary demonic beasts charging towards him, and his grip on the staff tightened, his gaze turning fierce!</p><p></p><p>The next moment, staff in hand, he swiftly pounced forward!</p><p></p><p>"You damned things! Die for me!"</p><p></p><p>.........</p><p></p><p>In the capital's prison.</p><p></p><p>"Master, the jailer said that a demonic calamity has broken out outside. Judging from those terrifying beast roars, it seems to be quite serious."</p><p></p><p>The old butler, holding the cold iron bars, looked towards the prison cell opposite.</p><p></p><p>Chen Dadao leaned against the prison wall, disheveled and listless. His lifeless eyes regained some focus as he said self-mockingly, "In that case, being locked up in this prison is actually quite safe. At least my life is not in immediate danger for the time being."</p><p></p><p>He lowered his head and continued, "Manager, the current disaster is exactly the same as what you predicted that day... Sometimes, I'm really impressed by your foresight. If only I had known earlier... Nevermind, there's no such thing as foreknowledge in this world."</p><p></p><p>Here is the full English translation of the Chinese excerpt:</p><p></p><p>The old butler pursed his lips and said, "My lord, this servant was only guessing back then, who would have known..."</p><p></p><p>Chen Dadao waved his hand to interrupt, "Let's not talk about it, it was my own foolishness."</p><p></p><p>The old butler sighed, "It's not that you are foolish, but rather that you are too kind..."</p><p></p><p>The air fell silent for a moment, then the old butler worriedly said again, "My lord, the lady is still outside, she should be alright, right?"</p><p></p><p>Chen Dadao trembled, hearing the faint roars of beasts, and said distractedly, "We are imprisoned here, worrying is useless, let's just leave it to fate."</p><p></p><p>The old butler let out a heavy sigh and fell silent.</p><p></p><p>...</p><p></p><p>"Grandma, we're safe hiding here, don't be afraid," Little Tong comforted the old woman in a very low voice from within the cellar.</p><p></p><p>She herself was pale-faced, the sounds and tremors of the demonic beast trampling the ground making her nerves taut.</p><p></p><p>She was gripping a silver coin tightly in her palm, as if that coin could give her immense strength!</p><p></p><p>The old woman had a slight smile on her face, not showing much fear. Her aged hands gently stroked Little Tong's face, her eyes full of tenderness.</p><p></p><p>Before, it was she who had raised her granddaughter, and now, it was the granddaughter protecting her.</p><p></p><p>Boom!</p><p></p><p>At that moment, a furry sharp claw suddenly pierced down from above, just barely missing them!</p><p></p><p>"Mmph..."</p><p></p><p>This startled the two of them, and Little Tong instinctively covered the old woman's mouth, holding her breath until her face turned red, neither daring to make a sound.</p><p></p><p>The furry claw began to slowly move to the other side...</p><p></p><p>Crack, crack, crack... Debris accompanied by a grating sound continued to fall.</p><p></p><p>Seeing this, Little Tong felt a little relieved, thinking that the demonic beast above had not noticed them.</p><p></p><p>"Hehe, you two little ants, did you really think I didn't notice you? I'm just toying with you..."</p><p></p><p>Suddenly, a chilling voice came from above.</p><p></p><p>The next moment, the claw swiftly changed direction, lunging towards the old woman!</p><p></p><p>This strike would be fatal for an ordinary person!</p><p></p><p>Little Tong's face changed drastically, instinctively wanting to turn the old woman around to take the blow herself!</p><p></p><p>But the old woman stubbornly kept her body steady, and Little Tong couldn't pull her over.</p><p></p><p>"Grandma!! What are you doing?!" </p><p></p><p>Little Tong cried anxiously, her face deathly pale.</p><p></p><p>The old woman's wrinkled face broke into a smile: "Little Tong, you are still young..."</p><p></p><p>Seeing the icy claw rapidly approaching the old woman, Little Tong was frantic, an unprecedented, intense flame suddenly spreading from her heart.</p><p></p><p>"Grandma, you can't die... I won't let you die!"</p><p></p><p>Little Tong's face suddenly became cold, and a faint glow began to emanate from her eyes!</p><p></p><p>Just as that light grew brighter and brighter,</p><p></p><p>A figure in blue robes materialized in front of the two of them. With a casual gesture, he blocked the icy claw, and with a finger, he tapped Little Tong's forehead.</p><p></p><p>Little Tong's body trembled, the glow in her eyes gradually fading, her cold expression becoming serene. A sensation of dizziness immediately overwhelmed her.</p><p></p><p>Before losing consciousness, she vaguely saw a young man.</p><p></p><p>"Brother..."</p><p></p><p>Uttering these two words, she fainted in the old woman's embrace, her tightly clenched hand finally loosening, a silver coin rolling to the ground.</p><p></p><p>L√º Changsheng released the icy claw, and it, along with the demonic beast above, dissipated into nothingness.</p><p></p><p>He waved his hand, and the silver coin on the ground flew into his palm. He blew the dust off it and pocketed it, then looked at the bewildered old woman with a gentle smile.</p><p></p><p>"Old one, do you still remember me?"</p>

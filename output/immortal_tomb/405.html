        <h1>Chapter 405</h1>
        <div class="content">
            <p>Here is the full English translation of the Chinese excerpt:</p><p></p><p>In a gloomy area of the Divine-Demonic Battlefield, a young man in a blue robe was seated across from a vague, faceless figure.</p><p></p><p>The young man in blue was Luchang Sheng, while the vague figure was the Heavenly Dao Origin of the Divine-Demonic Battlefield.</p><p></p><p>As the Heavenly Dao carefully poured tea into the cup in front of them, Luchang Sheng spoke in a calm tone, "You've summoned me, what did you wish to discuss?"</p><p></p><p>The Heavenly Dao cleared its throat twice, hesitating for a moment before speaking, "Lord Changsheng, about that Great Dao Demon-Suppressing Tower..."</p><p></p><p>As the Heavenly Dao of the Divine-Demonic Battlefield, nothing could escape its sight if it wished to see it. Especially not something as significant as the Great Dao Demon-Suppressing Tower.</p><p></p><p>It had witnessed Luchang Sheng forcibly take away that tower with unimaginable power. From that moment on, the Heavenly Dao knew Luchang Sheng's strength was truly terrifying. </p><p></p><p>That's why it did not try to stop him, for it knew the chances of success were very slim. It might have even risked its own origin essence.</p><p></p><p>After all, even the Heavenly Dao itself could not budge that Great Dao Demon-Suppressing Tower in the slightest.</p><p></p><p>Moreover, the Heavenly Dao could vaguely sense a mysterious, great terror from Luchang Sheng, akin to a bloodline suppression.</p><p></p><p>Therefore, the Heavenly Dao was extremely wary and even fearful of Luchang Sheng.</p><p></p><p>Recalling the past, the Heavenly Dao realized this feeling was similar to when the mysterious figure had placed the Great Dao Demon-Suppressing Tower in the Divine-Demonic Battlefield. </p><p></p><p>At that time, the Heavenly Dao had faced that mysterious figure directly. And now, facing Lord Changsheng, it sensed a similar feeling.</p><p></p><p>Hearing this, Luchang Sheng's eyes flickered. All the tribes referred to that tower as the Colorful Jade Tower, yet the Heavenly Dao knew its true name. </p><p></p><p>This meant the Heavenly Dao of the Divine-Demonic Battlefield must have communicated with the master of the Great Dao Demon-Suppressing Tower before. </p><p></p><p>In Luchang Sheng's view, if the mysterious master of that tower wished to avoid being detected by the Heavenly Dao, it should have been a simple matter.</p><p></p><p>"What, you have an issue with me taking that broken tower?" Luchang Sheng asked calmly after taking a sip of tea.</p><p></p><p>The Heavenly Dao suddenly felt an inexplicable pressure, and with some difficulty, it said, "Lord Changsheng, the Heavenly Dao naturally does not dare to object. It's just that Lord Changsheng..."</p><p></p><p>Trailing off, the Heavenly Dao seemed hesitant to continue.</p><p></p><p>Luchang Sheng's gaze narrowed as he released a slight aura of pressure towards the Heavenly Dao.</p><p></p><p>The Heavenly Dao trembled, hastily saying, "Lord Changsheng, please don't attack! I'll tell you, I'll tell you..."</p><p></p><p>Luchang Sheng retracted the aura, continuing to sip his tea.</p><p></p><p>Feeling the oppressive force disappear, the Heavenly Dao let out a breath of relief, its attitude becoming even more respectful.</p><p></p><p>"Lord Changsheng, the Heavenly Dao naturally does not dare to object to you taking the Great Dao Demon-Suppressing Tower. It's just that... that mysterious figure had once come to me and said he had some matters to attend to and would be gone for a while. He instructed me to keep an eye on the tower, as it contained a supreme great demon that, if freed, would bring calamity to all living beings. And now..."</p><p></p><p>Luchang Sheng smiled, "It seems that tower's master still lacks confidence in his own abilities."</p><p></p><p>The Heavenly Dao replied, "That's not the case. The mysterious figure was as confident as you, Lord Changsheng. He just said that he didn't know when he would return, so he asked me to watch over the tower. But now that you've taken it..."</p><p></p><p>Here is the full English translation of the excerpt from the Chinese novel:</p><p></p><p>"When will he return, and this suppressed supreme great demon, as the mysterious person said, is difficult to kill and destroy, and his strength will continue to grow, so......"</p><p></p><p>Lu Changsheng nodded slightly, indicating that he had moved, and continued to ask, "Did he tell you where he went? If he is afraid that this supreme great demon will wreak havoc on the endless void, then he should just keep guarding it, right?"</p><p></p><p>Tian Dao shook his head, pondered for a moment, and said respectfully, "Although the mysterious person did not explicitly say so at the time, I also guessed the general situation. The mysterious person should want to find a way to completely eliminate this supreme great demon once and for all."</p><p></p><p>Lu Changsheng did not say anything, but there was a hint of curiosity in his eyes, not knowing where the owner of the tower was at the moment, and whether he had found a way to completely destroy this supreme great demon.</p><p></p><p>Thinking of this, Lu Changsheng recalled the scene where he had previously led Hunhui into the Great Dao Demon Suppressing Tower and struck out a sword towards the Reincarnation Demon Child...</p><p></p><p>His gaze flickered a bit, to be honest, he had used some strength in that strike, but he had not been able to kill it.</p><p></p><p>"Well, so what do you mean?" Lu Changsheng looked at Tian Dao.</p><p></p><p>Tian Dao said awkwardly, "Lord Changsheng's strength is much greater than mine. Although the Great Dao Demon Suppressing Tower has been taken away by Lord Changsheng, guarding that supreme great demon is naturally much stronger than me."</p><p></p><p>"Today, I just want to tell Lord Changsheng all the information I know about the supreme great demon..."</p><p></p><p>Tian Dao did not continue, nor did it dare to speak up. It knew that Lu Changsheng understood, that it had said so much just to alert Lu Changsheng, to let him know the seriousness of the situation.</p><p></p><p>After all, it had promised that mysterious person that if that mysterious person suddenly returned one day and found the Great Dao Demon Suppressing Tower missing, how would it explain? If that mysterious person became angry, wouldn't it be in trouble?</p><p></p><p>And now, this Lord Changsheng is also not to be offended...</p><p></p><p>Tian Dao felt that it was in a difficult situation and could only consider a compromise.</p><p></p><p>"Of course, if Lord Changsheng finds it troublesome, you can... you can put the Great Dao Demon Suppressing Tower back in the Divine-Demon Battlefield, and this hard work can still be done by Tian Dao?" Tian Dao quickly asked cautiously.</p><p></p><p>Lu Changsheng smiled and said, "Now that the supreme great demon is no longer in the Great Dao Demon Suppressing Tower, what's the use of putting the tower back?"</p><p></p><p>As soon as Lu Changsheng finished speaking, Tian Dao was stunned for a moment, then was shocked and suddenly stood up:</p><p></p><p>"What?!!"</p><p></p><p>Tian Dao quickly stomped its feet and paced back and forth, showing its anxiousness.</p><p></p><p>Regarding the terribleness of that supreme great demon, it believed that the mysterious person had not lied to it, so the endless void was about to be in turmoil?</p><p></p><p>Also, when was that supreme great demon able to break the seal?</p><p></p><p>"Lord Changsheng, how did you know that the supreme great demon is no longer in the Great Dao Demon Suppressing Tower?" Tian Dao asked hurriedly.</p><p></p><p>Tian Dao had once wanted to enter the Great Dao Demon Suppressing Tower to take a look, but the tower, for some reason, was very rejective of Tian Dao and it could not enter.</p><p></p><p>Lu Changsheng smiled and said, "Don't worry, that thing has been suppressed by me in the Soul Realm, and there shouldn't be any problems for now."</p><p></p><p>Huh? The Soul Realm?</p><p></p><p>.........</p>

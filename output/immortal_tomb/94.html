            <p>Here is the full English translation of the Chinese excerpt:</p><p></p><p>The Nameless Mountain Peak. New 69 Book Bar 99sh.com</p><p></p><p>Lu Changsheng looked at the old woman in the coffin, threw the blue jade bracelet into it, and then with a flash of his eyes, the coffin lid automatically closed.</p><p></p><p>The soil quickly covered it, and a gravestone that came from nowhere was firmly planted.</p><p></p><p>On the gravestone, the golden light flickered, and the epitaph gradually emerged.</p><p></p><p>Lu Changsheng glanced at the gravestone and disappeared in a single step.</p><p></p><p>The 15th year, winter.</p><p></p><p>Lu Changsheng came to Moyu Town and appeared in the small tavern.</p><p></p><p>Seeing the man in green robes entering the shop, the innkeeper Zhang Cheng was stunned on the spot and rubbed his eyes hard.</p><p></p><p>"Sir... ..."</p><p></p><p>Zhang Cheng joyfully went to greet him.</p><p></p><p>Lu Changsheng looked at Zhang Cheng's graying temples and smiled, "It's been seven years, hasn't it?"</p><p></p><p>Zhang Cheng smiled respectfully and sighed, "Yes, it's been seven years since you last left Moyu."</p><p></p><p>Lu Changsheng nodded slightly and asked, "Do you still have peach blossom wine? I haven't had it in a long time."</p><p></p><p>Zhang Cheng smiled and nodded, "Yes, yes, yes."</p><p></p><p>"Oh, innkeeper, you still have stock! Didn't you say the peach blossom wine would be sold out by autumn?"</p><p></p><p>Soon, a dissatisfied customer said.</p><p></p><p>"Yes, Innkeeper Zhang, this is too much! Which of us here isn't a regular customer?"  Other customers also voiced their discontent.</p><p></p><p>Zhang Cheng smiled awkwardly and said, "Esteemed guests, the peach blossom wine is reserved for this gentleman. You can also place orders for next year..."</p><p></p><p>"Tsk, we've never heard you mention this reservation system in your tavern before."</p><p></p><p>The customers grumbled a bit, then quieted down, as they were familiar with Zhang Cheng and wouldn't cause trouble.</p><p></p><p>Lu Changsheng went to sit by the window.</p><p></p><p>Soon, Zhang Cheng came out with a pot of wine and a gourd.</p><p></p><p>"Sit down and let's drink together."</p><p></p><p>Just as Zhang Cheng was about to leave, he heard Lu Changsheng laugh.</p><p></p><p>Zhang Cheng's body trembled, and he slowly sat down, pouring a cup for Lu Changsheng and himself, then raised his cup, "Sir, Zhang Cheng toasts you!"</p><p></p><p>"Good."</p><p></p><p>Lu Changsheng raised his cup and clinked it with Zhang Cheng's.</p><p></p><p>Zhang Cheng was pleasantly surprised and quickly drained his cup.</p><p></p><p>"Over the past seven years, even if I didn't come, did you still stock up on some peach blossom wine every year?"</p><p></p><p>Lu Changsheng put down his cup and said.</p><p></p><p>Zhang Cheng laughed dryly, "Sir, you love drinking the peach blossom wine, it's an honor for our tavern."</p><p></p><p>Lu Changsheng shook his head and sighed, "What honor or dishonor is there? I haven't given you any special treatment, I just drink and pay like an ordinary customer."</p><p></p><p>Zhang Cheng fell silent and said, "Sir, it's not like that. You've saved Moyu Town several times, which is tantamount to having a great debt of gratitude to Zhang Cheng..."</p><p></p><p>"And seven years ago, I heard that a terrifying demonic plague had broken out in the entire Eastern Domain, and Moyu Town was on the verge of crisis at the time. It was that old senior who appeared at a critical moment and saved Moyu Town again."</p><p></p><p>Lu Changsheng was surprised and asked with a smile, "The old senior? Was he dressed in dark green, with a hunched back, long beard, and unsightly appearance?"</p><p></p><p>Zhang Cheng's eyes lit up and he nodded, "Yes, yes, yes, that was your servant!"</p><p></p><p>He had a very deep impression of the old turtle, who had scolded the whole town when Lu Changsheng left Moyu Town.</p><p></p><p>In the end, when the crisis broke out, he unexpectedly took action...</p><p></p><p>Lu Changsheng nodded, this was not something he had instructed. He didn't expect that old turtle to have secretly done such a thing.</p><p></p><p>At this moment, if the old turtle, wherever he was, knew Lu Changsheng's thoughts, he would certainly cry out in protest, "Master, it was all that little Crane's doing, who begged me to help with the matter of visiting prostitutes!"</p><p></p><p>"Zhang Cheng, after today, I don't know when I'll come back to buy peach blossom wine from you next."</p><p></p><p>Lu Changsheng looked at Zhang Cheng and smiled.</p><p></p><p>Zhang Cheng was stunned for a moment, then forced a smile at the corners of his mouth, "I will prepare peach blossom wine for you every year, and guarantee that you will find it when you come."</p><p></p><p>Here is the full English translation of the excerpt from the Chinese novel:</p><p></p><p>It didn't matter what season it was, there was always peach blossom wine to drink.</p><p></p><p>Lu Changsheng's Adam's apple bobbed as he pushed a gold coin over and said, "Okay, here's the money for the wine first."</p><p></p><p>...</p><p></p><p>As soon as Lu Changsheng left the tavern, </p><p>Jiwuqing entered.</p><p></p><p>Seeing this, Zhang Cheng hurriedly ran over and said, "Miss, the gentleman just left."</p><p></p><p>Jiwuqing's heart trembled, and she immediately disappeared.</p><p></p><p>Zhang Cheng sighed. Over the years, the woman in the black robe had come to his tavern many times, each time just asking if the gentleman had been here.</p><p></p><p>He was already used to it.</p><p></p><p>At the same time, </p><p>Jiwuqing appeared outside Moyu Town, and she immediately spotted the figure in blue robes gradually walking away in the icy and snowy landscape!</p><p></p><p>She hurriedly chased after him.</p><p></p><p>"Senior! Senior!"</p><p></p><p>Lu Changsheng stopped in his tracks and turned around, silently looking at her.</p><p></p><p>The next moment, the mighty Demon Venerable knelt down heavily!</p><p></p><p>"Senior, can you restore Wuqing's arm... Without this arm, Wuqing will have difficulty passing the tribulation of ascension..."</p><p></p><p>Jiwuqing knelt and trembled as she spoke. She had been searching for Lu Changsheng for many years.</p><p></p><p>Lu Changsheng looked at the woman in black, kneeling like a blooming black lotus.</p><p></p><p>"Senior, as long as you restore Wuqing's arm, Wuqing will agree to anything!" Jiwuqing said miserably.</p><p></p><p>She had always been domineering in her life, but she had never been so humble before. If she couldn't ascend, she didn't know the meaning of continuing to live.</p><p></p><p>"You don't need to promise me anything."</p><p></p><p>After a long silence, Lu Changsheng finally spoke, then walked away with his hands behind his back.</p><p></p><p>"Senior..." Jiwuqing saw her hope fade, but the next moment, she found the mysterious power in her arm had dissipated.</p><p></p><p>She was overjoyed and quickly looked up, but Lu Changsheng's figure had already disappeared.</p><p></p><p>In the end, she heavily kowtowed.</p><p></p><p>"Thank you, Senior, for not remembering my past transgressions."</p><p></p><p>...</p><p></p><p>The twentieth year.</p><p></p><p>This was a different year. This year, Jiwuqing, Qin Fuming, and Liu Wusu successively ascended to the immortal realm.</p><p></p><p>Immediately after, the ancestral masters of various sects and domains trained with extraordinary diligence and effort to vie for the top position, directly leading to a wave of cultivation fervor.</p><p></p><p>The Demon Realm and the Devil Realm had also already selected new venerable ones.</p><p></p><p>At this point, everything had changed.</p><p></p><p>Qingyun Sect.</p><p></p><p>Lu Changsheng's arrival made the old Crane Forest overjoyed, and they quickly invited him to the Elegant Courtyard.</p><p></p><p>As for the old Turtle's absence, he naturally knew about it. Hearing Tongxin say that he seemed to have been slapped away by the Senior and didn't know if he was dead or not.</p><p></p><p>To be honest, the old Crane Forest still missed the old Turtle a bit.</p><p></p><p>Lu Changsheng swept his gaze over the three people, smiling and saying, "I will be leaving this realm soon."</p><p></p><p>"Senior is also going to ascend?!" </p><p></p><p>Before the old Crane Forest could speak, Tongxin instinctively exclaimed in shock!</p><p></p><p>Slap!</p><p></p><p>The old Crane Forest gave him a heavy blow on the head, scolding, "How can you be so stupid! Haven't you realized it by now? With Senior's cultivation, does he still need to ascend? Senior is already an immortal!"</p><p></p><p>Tongxin covered his head and cried.</p><p></p><p>The old Crane Forest glared at him, then looked at Lu Changsheng with reluctance, "Senior, when will you leave? Can Crane Forest see you off then?"</p><p></p><p>Tongxin and Lin Dong also looked at Lu Changsheng with deep sorrow.</p><p></p><p>Lu Changsheng waved his hand, "No need. You have some karmic connection with me. Continue cultivating well and strive to ascend to the immortal realm as soon as possible."</p><p></p><p>"When you have free time, go see Chen Dadao and deliver some things for me."</p><p></p><p>"We will obey the Senior's orders."</p><p></p><p>The three of them bowed solemnly.</p><p></p><p>At this time, Tongxin glanced at the old Crane Forest and timidly asked, "Senior, is the immortal realm fun? Tongxin dares to ask, are you considered powerful in the immortal realm...?"</p><p></p><p>"Insolent, so disrespectful!" The old Crane Forest was startled and was about to hit Tongxin on the head!</p><p></p><p>Lu Changsheng smiled and waved his hand, and the old Crane Forest put down his hand, glaring fiercely at Tongxin, definitely planning to deal with this little guy later!</p><p></p><p>Lu Changsheng swept his sleeve across the table, and suddenly many heavenly treasures appeared, leaving the three of them dumbfounded. What kind of peerless treasures were these?</p><p></p><p>"This Lifespring Heavenly Lotus is for Chen Dadao. Don't forget it." Lu Changsheng stood up, clasped his hands behind his back, and walked out. His blue robe gradually disappeared into the void, and only his laughter echoed, "As for whether I'm considered powerful in the immortal realm... You'll know when you get there."</p>

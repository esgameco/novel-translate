        <h1>Chapter 280</h1>
        <div class="content">
            <p>Here is the full English translation of the Chinese excerpt:</p><p></p><p>Boom!</p><p></p><p>The battle disturbance on the Ouyang clan's side was becoming increasingly fierce. üéÖüíò‚ûÖ‚ùæùìºÔΩàùêîœá.ùïî√òÔΩç‚úåüêö</p><p></p><p>Ouyang Nuo, hearing this, was extremely anxious in his heart, and he shouted loudly,</p><p></p><p>"Our clan does not understand what the Daoist friend is saying, I just ask one question, Daoist friend, have you intervened and decided today?"</p><p></p><p>Li Shuyan: "Yes, I have decided."</p><p></p><p>He then said:</p><p></p><p>"Not only have I decided, but your Ouyang clan... will be wiped out without leaving a chicken or a dog!"</p><p></p><p>"Hahaha!" Ouyang Nuo's angry expression turned into a mocking laugh, his neck veins bulging: "Wiped out without leaving a chicken or a dog? If you have the ability, then come!"</p><p></p><p>Hearing this, Li Shuyan sneered contemptuously, and his powerful aura suddenly burst forth, sweeping across this space!</p><p></p><p>Boom!</p><p></p><p>The overwhelming pressure of the Shen Yuan Realm Eighth Transformation suddenly descended upon everyone, making their hearts jump violently.</p><p></p><p>The first to be affected was Ouyang Nuo, whose face turned pale, his whole body being squeezed, his bones cracking.</p><p></p><p>His eyes were slightly vacant as he said with difficulty, "Shen... Yuan Realm Eighth Transformation..."</p><p></p><p>How could he fight this... </p><p></p><p>He was only at the Shen Yuan Realm Fifth Transformation, a difference of three transformations.</p><p></p><p>Fu Liancai and the others were also shocked, their facial features twisted in surprise.</p><p></p><p>"Rumble‚Äî"</p><p></p><p>Suddenly, accompanying this explosive sound, the battle on the Ouyang clan's side had also mysteriously subsided.</p><p></p><p>The members of the Ouyang clan turned pale, could it be that their Ouyang clan had already been subdued by the Liu clan?</p><p></p><p>Just then!!</p><p></p><p>Two figures fell from the sky, landing heavily on the Fu clan's ground with a 'bang', kicking up countless rocks and dust!</p><p></p><p>As the dust settled, the two half-dead figures became clear.</p><p></p><p>"Ancestor! Clan Leader!" </p><p></p><p>The elders of the Liu clan were stunned, and then cried out in horror!</p><p></p><p>Because these two were the Clan Leader and Ancestor of the Liu clan!</p><p></p><p>The onlooking crowd was also in an uproar, puzzled, as they looked over and indeed saw Liu Qing and an old man lying there, their bodies in tatters.</p><p></p><p>What, what happened? Wasn't the Liu Clan Leader and Liu Clan Ancestor going to attack the Ouyang clan?</p><p></p><p>They were at the Shen Yuan Realm Fifth Transformation and the early Shen Yang Realm, the Shen Yang Realm!</p><p></p><p>Everyone present had their minds blank, staring dumbfoundedly at this bizarre scene.</p><p></p><p>Ouyang Nuo's pupils shrank as he looked at this, the corner of his mouth twitching, gradually spreading into a grin, he understood, and the next moment, his wild laughter resounded!</p><p></p><p>"Hahaha! Liu Qing!! Wanting to dominate the Jingxun City? Your ambition is not small! Don't think that just because our Clan Leader is not here, you can swallow our Ouyang clan!"</p><p></p><p>&lt;tt_keyword_ad data-title="Game" data-tag="Featured Recommendations" data-type="1" data-value="1913"&gt;&lt;/tt_keyword_ad&gt;</p><p></p><p>On the ground,</p><p></p><p>Liu Qing's face was covered in blood, he squinted his eyes with difficulty, looking at the gloating Ouyang Nuo, his lips moving, but he had no strength at all.</p><p></p><p>Just then,</p><p></p><p>A white-robed old man with his hands behind his back appeared in front of Liu Qing and the Liu clan Ancestor, looking down at them.</p><p></p><p>Suddenly, countless gazes converged on the white-robed old man who had suddenly appeared.</p><p></p><p>Many of them had a bewildered look, but some also had their pupils suddenly constricting.</p><p></p><p>While Ouyang Nuo and the Ouyang clan disciples were delighted, they all knelt down and respectfully called out:</p><p></p><p>"Greetings, Ancestor!"</p><p></p><p>The Ouyang Ancestor!!</p><p></p><p>Everyone shuddered!</p><p></p><p>Seeing the heavily injured Liu Qing and Liu clan Ancestor on the ground, they seemed to understand.</p><p></p><p>The Ouyang Ancestor must have broken through again...</p><p></p><p>Everyone knew that from this day on, the Ouyang clan would dominate the Jingxun City!</p><p></p><p>"All my Ouyang clan disciples, rise." The Ouyang Ancestor said indifferently.</p><p></p><p>Hearing this, Ouyang Nuo and the others hurriedly stood up.</p><p></p><p>Ouyang Nuo descended from the sky, looking at Ouyang Ancestor with delight, "Ancestor, have you broken through?"</p><p></p><p>Ouyang Ancestor smiled faintly, neither confirming nor denying.</p><p></p><p>Seeing this, the Ouyang clan members were delighted,</p><p></p><p>While Fu Liancai and the others were as if they had lost their souls, today was truly difficult for them.</p><p></p><p>After all, even the Liu clan Ancestor was now lying half-dead there, which was truly hard to accept.</p><p></p><p>At this moment, Li Shuyan looked solemnly at the Ouyang Ancestor, and the hand holding the Zhan Xu had tightened a bit.</p><p></p><p>This old man, he could not defeat.</p><p></p><p>Here is my translation of the Chinese excerpt:</p><p></p><p>Yang N√º suddenly looked up at Li Shuo-yan with a mocking gaze, then seemed to transmit something to Ouyang Zui...</p><p></p><p>"Oh?" </p><p></p><p>Ouyang Zui raised an eyebrow and looked up at Li Shuo-yan with a half-smile, saying, "You said you would wipe out my Ouyang clan?"</p><p></p><p>Li Shuo-yan's expression hardened, but he forced himself to stay calm. "That's right."</p><p></p><p>Ouyang Zui was quite surprised, and laughed. "What is your backing? Is it your cultivation at the Eight Reversal Spirit Origin Realm?"</p><p></p><p>Li Shuo-yan pressed his lips together and fell silent.</p><p></p><p>"Who told you to stand up there and talk to this old man? Get down here!" </p><p></p><p>Ouyang Zui's expression suddenly changed, and he shouted.</p><p></p><p>Boom!</p><p></p><p>Li Shuo-yan felt as if a massive mountain was pressing down on him, and he plummeted from the sky, landing on the ground. He could barely stabilize himself by leaning on his sword.</p><p></p><p>Hmm?</p><p></p><p>Ouyang Zui glanced at the sword in Li Shuo-yan's hand, looking somewhat surprised.</p><p></p><p>He then raised an eyebrow and said, "Let this old man take a look at the sword in your hand."</p><p></p><p>Hearing this, Li Shuo-yan stood up straight, holding Zhan Xu, as if he hadn't heard.</p><p></p><p>Seeing this, the atmosphere in the area grew tense, and many gazes were focused on the unremarkable-looking sword, unable to understand.</p><p></p><p>Fu Liang-cai and the others pressed their lips together and quickly moved towards Li Shuo-yan's position. </p><p></p><p>Since that person had stepped in to help their Fu clan, they naturally wouldn't just stand by and watch.</p><p></p><p>Even if the outcome today would be tragic.</p><p></p><p>Actually, Fu Liang-cai had probably guessed that the friend from the Luo clan was likely a powerful cultivator at the Spirit Sun Realm.</p><p></p><p>However, he was not sure which stage of the Spirit Sun Realm this person was at. If it was the early stage, then they had no chance at all today.</p><p></p><p>Because the Liu clan's ancestor was at the early Spirit Sun Realm, having condensed one round of dazzling sun, but was still beaten to this state by the Ouyang ancestor.</p><p></p><p>Thinking about it, Ouyang Zui, that old fellow, should have broken through to the middle Spirit Sun Realm, having condensed two rounds of dazzling sun!</p><p></p><p>...</p><p></p><p>Ouyang Zui was completely unconcerned about the movements of the Fu clan and the others.</p><p></p><p>After all, he had condensed two rounds of dazzling sun at the middle Spirit Sun Realm.</p><p></p><p>Who in this place could match him?!</p><p></p><p>It could be said that from the moment he broke through to the middle Spirit Sun Realm, he had become the absolute ruler of Jingyu City!</p><p></p><p>And not just Jingyu City, even in the Ancient Wasteland, a cultivator at the middle Spirit Sun Realm would be considered a powerful expert!</p><p></p><p>"If this old man tells you to hand over the sword, and you don't hear it, or do you want this old man to take it himself?"</p><p></p><p>Ouyang Zui said as he slowly walked towards Li Shuo-yan, continuing, "Hand it over yourself, and this old man will let you die a quick death..."</p><p></p><p>Li Shuo-yan's brow furrowed, and his violent spiritual power began to circulate.</p><p></p><p>Fu Liang-cai and the others also struggled to take a defensive stance, feeling like they were facing a great calamity!</p><p></p><p>But the oppressive aura of the Spirit Sun Realm prevented them from fully unfolding their abilities.</p><p></p><p>Among the Fu clan, Fu Shi-yu's face was pale, and Fu Tao's body was trembling.</p><p></p><p>This feeling of being crushed by a powerful expert, this feeling of death being right in front of them, this feeling of being unable to resist, was extremely painful and utterly hopeless!</p><p></p><p>Ouyang Zui let out a cold laugh, his body shaking, and two dazzling suns slowly rose behind him, a powerful and scorching aura suddenly descending!</p><p></p><p>"Since you are so stubborn, then all of you shall die."</p><p></p><p>As he spoke, the two suns behind him suddenly vibrated, unleashing infinite brilliance, and scorching waves surged forth, causing the air to boil, and the ground of Jingyu City to crack and scorch.</p><p></p><p>The onlookers in the distance were shocked. Even though they were so far away, they could still feel their skin being scorched, and even start to smoke.</p><p></p><p>Boom--</p><p></p><p>Suddenly,</p><p></p><p>an extremely scorching wave rushed towards Li Shuo-yan and the others!</p><p></p><p>The terrifying temperature, if hit, would vaporize them instantly!</p><p></p><p>The eyes of Li Shuo-yan and the others immediately turned red, their hearts pounding frantically!</p><p></p><p>But they were suppressed by the Spirit Sun Realm's aura and could not resist. If they diverted their attention to deal with the scorching wave, they would be instantly crushed by the Spirit Sun Realm's pressure.</p><p></p><p>But if they didn't, the wave would consume them!</p><p></p><p>The power of a Spirit Sun Realm expert was truly terrifying!</p><p></p><p>Li Shuo-yan finally couldn't endure it anymore and let out a roar: "Sir! Shuo-yan can't hold on anymore!!"</p><p></p><p>As soon as he spoke, the Zhan Xu in his embrace suddenly unsheathed!</p><p></p><p>"Whoosh--!"</p><p></p><p>Zhan Xu charged forward, carrying a brilliant azure light, slicing through the endless scorching wave in front of it!</p><p></p><p>The terrifying edge was aimed directly at the bewildered Ouyang Zui!!</p><p></p><p>This sudden change left everyone stunned and unable to react!</p>

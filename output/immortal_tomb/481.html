        <h1>Chapter 481</h1>
        <div class="content">
            <p>Here is the full English translation of the Chinese excerpt:</p><p></p><p>"Wow, big brother, this is the domain of the Sea of Laws! We have arrived safely and without incident!" </p><p></p><p>By the window of the top-class suite, Chen Pang excitedly looked out the window.</p><p></p><p>Beside him, Little Chai, who was carefully studying the sea chart, did not seem as excited, but instead had a furrowed brow.</p><p></p><p>Seeing that he was the only one happily grinning, Chen Pang felt a bit awkward, and then turned to look at Little Chai: "Big brother, we've already arrived at the Sea of Laws, so why don't I see you looking very happy?"</p><p></p><p>Little Chai let out a sigh and gave Chen Pang a sideways glance, saying helplessly, "Fatty, you're too naive. Do you think that just because we've arrived at the Sea of Laws, everything will be smooth sailing?"</p><p></p><p>Chen Pang looked puzzled. "Isn't that the case?"</p><p></p><p>"No, you're completely wrong. Before coming to the Sea of Laws, I did a lot of research. It's not as simple as you think - the Sea of Laws is actually the most dangerous place." </p><p></p><p>Little Chai's expression was grave.</p><p></p><p>Huh?</p><p></p><p>Chen Pang's expression stiffened, and the joyful mood he had just experienced instantly dissipated. </p><p></p><p>Chen Pang suddenly thought of Lu Changsheng, and after pondering for a while, he hesitantly said, "Big brother, will it be safer if we follow the elder..."</p><p></p><p>Little Chai's expression changed slightly, and he said impatiently, "Why would the elder take us along? We're strangers to him. If you were in his shoes, would you want to bring two extra burdens?"</p><p></p><p>Chen Pang smiled awkwardly and fell silent, no longer daring to say anything. He also felt that it was unrealistic.</p><p></p><p>Moreover, Chen Pang felt that following Lu Changsheng was also very dangerous. After all, in the elder's eyes, they were probably no different from ants. If the elder was in a bad mood, he could just casually "light them up" and that would be the end of them.</p><p></p><p>Thinking of this, Chen Pang shuddered in fear and quickly dismissed the idea from his mind.</p><p></p><p>"Woooo—"</p><p></p><p>At this moment, the loud ship horn of the Sea Runner No. 3 sounded again.</p><p></p><p>Immediately afterwards, the captain's voice rang out, with a barely suppressed laughter:</p><p></p><p>"We are about to arrive at Eternal Night Island, everyone get ready."</p><p></p><p>As soon as the words fell, cheers erupted on the Sea Runner No. 3:</p><p></p><p>"Woohoo~~~"</p><p></p><p>"Damn, we've been drifting at sea for hundreds of years, finally we can feel the solid ground beneath our feet!"</p><p></p><p>"Eternal Night Island, does that mean the island is always in a state of darkness?"</p><p></p><p>"That's right, exactly as you understand it."</p><p></p><p>"Huh, how do you know? Fellow Daoist, have you been here before?"</p><p></p><p>"Hehe, of course. This is my second time coming to the Sea of Laws. The first time was when my grandfather took me here when I was young. This time, in addition to comprehending the laws, I'm also here to look for my grandfather."</p><p></p><p>"Whoa, impressive! Your grandfather must be a renowned figure in the Sea of Laws!"</p><p></p><p>"Fellow Daoists, please don't speak of it that way. My grandfather once told me that when traveling outside, one should keep a low profile."</p><p></p><p>"..."</p><p></p><p>All the cultivators crowded around the deck railings, excitedly looking at the distant darkness.</p><p></p><p>While it was broad daylight where they were, over there it was pitch black.</p><p></p><p>Everyone knew that must be the area of Eternal Night Island.</p><p></p><p>"Woooo—"</p><p></p><p>The moment the Sea Runner No. 3 sailed into that sea domain, the sky suddenly changed from day to night.</p><p></p><p>Many cultivators who had never been to the Sea of Laws were amazed by this sight. They looked back, only to be stunned to see that it was now completely dark.</p><p></p><p>Logically, after entering this dark sea area, they should have been able to see the daylight domain behind them. But the fact was, they could see nothing - the daylight domain seemed to have completely disappeared.</p><p></p><p>Here is the full English translation of the Chinese excerpt:</p><p></p><p>It was simply marvelous.</p><p></p><p>"Pata!"</p><p></p><p>On the Sea Transport No. 3, a night light lamp made of luminescent stones suddenly shot forward into the dark night, instantly illuminating the path ahead.</p><p></p><p>Moments later, in the cultivators' line of sight, a black shadow appeared, and the black shadow grew larger and larger, with numerous twinkling lights within it.</p><p></p><p>Eternal Night Island!</p><p></p><p>At the same time, the captain had already come to the door of the top-tier suite, respectfully saying:</p><p></p><p>"My lord, we have arrived at Eternal Night Island. We will stay here for a few days to resupply, and then continue our journey."</p><p></p><p>The door soon opened, and Lu Changsheng walked out, followed by Chen Pang and Xiao Chai.</p><p></p><p>Seeing this, the captain hurriedly bowed even lower to show his respect.</p><p></p><p>"Good, I understand. You may go and attend to your duties," Lu Changsheng smiled kindly at the captain.</p><p></p><p>The captain was suddenly overwhelmed with a sense of being favored, then responded with a bow and withdrew.</p><p></p><p>The Sea Transport No. 3 was about to dock, and as the captain, he indeed had things to do.</p><p></p><p>Afterwards, Lu Changsheng and the other two came to the deck.</p><p></p><p>The cultivators who had been noisily cheering on the deck fell silent the moment they saw Lu Changsheng arrive.</p><p></p><p>The entire deck became quiet.</p><p></p><p>Soon, the cultivators reacted again, and hurriedly greeted Lu Changsheng with salutes: "My lord!"</p><p></p><p>Lu Changsheng smiled kindly.</p><p></p><p>This really frightened the cultivators!</p><p></p><p>"My lord, please don't smile, we're afraid!"</p><p></p><p>In fact, they would have preferred to see Lu Changsheng's expressionless face rather than his smile.</p><p></p><p>Although the young man was as gentle as jade, his smile was as warm and kind as the Grim Reaper's.</p><p></p><p>Seeing the cultivators' pale faces, and some even breaking out in cold sweat, Lu Changsheng couldn't help but ask:</p><p></p><p>"What? Am I that scary?"</p><p></p><p>The cultivators trembled and hurriedly said:</p><p></p><p>"No, no, no, my lord is just joking! My lord is not scary at all!"</p><p></p><p>"Yes, since I was born, I have never seen a person as amiable and kind as my lord. My admiration for you is endless, and these are all heartfelt words!"</p><p></p><p>"My lord, when I was young, I learned physiognomy from my grandfather. I just took the liberty of looking at your physiognomy, and my lord is handsome and graceful, truly a great person. As the saying goes, 'the appearance reflects the heart,' your appearance clearly shows that you are a great and virtuous person. Isn't that right, everyone?"</p><p></p><p>"Yes, yes, yes!!"</p><p></p><p>Lu Changsheng: "Can you swear to the heavens?"</p><p></p><p>The cultivators suddenly fell silent, their faces turning pale, unable to either advance or retreat.</p><p></p><p>To the side, Qinghe and Lin, as well as Chen Pang and Xiao Chai, were pursing their lips, their expressions strange, as if they were holding back something.</p><p></p><p>Lu Changsheng glanced at the cultivators, naturally not going to bother with them.</p><p></p><p>"Woo woo woo woo--"</p><p></p><p>As the ship's horn sounded again, the Sea Transport No. 3 slowed down and drifted into the shore under the cover of night.</p><p></p><p>At this time, on the shore, the lights were bright, and hundreds of people were standing there, though it was unclear what they were doing.</p><p></p><p>As the Sea Transport No. 3 successfully docked, the moment the crew threw down the anchor, a fierce shout suddenly rang out from the shore:</p><p></p><p>"Robbery!! Everyone get off the ship!!"</p><p></p><p>.........</p><p></p><p>PS: Please give me some free gifts.</p><p></p><p>For the fastest updates of flawless novels, please visit www.feixs.com</p><p></p><p>For mobile access: https://m.feixs.com/chapter-45751-38225600</p>

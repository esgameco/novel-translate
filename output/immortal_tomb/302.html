        <h1>Chapter 302</h1>
        <div class="content">
            <p>Here is the full English translation of the Chinese excerpt:</p><p></p><p>"Oh? Lord Duan, they all support my Wicked Abyss, so this shouldn't violate the rules, right?"</p><p></p><p>The Blood Demon Sect Master looked at Duan Jiuxiong and smiled.</p><p></p><p>Duan Jiuxiong smiled: "Of course."</p><p></p><p>"That's good then." The Blood Demon Sect Master nodded in satisfaction and slowly sat down.</p><p></p><p>...</p><p></p><p>In the tea gathering,</p><p></p><p>The expressions of Nangong Wenxin and Lai Qing had turned extremely grim. They didn't expect the Wicked Abyss to have secretly gained so much support.</p><p></p><p>If it were just ordinary Saint-Emperor Realm cultivators, they wouldn't have cared. But the terrifying part was that the supporters of the Wicked Abyss were all at the Divine Yang Realm!</p><p></p><p>"Hehe, I'm the number one this session. Does anyone else have any objections?"</p><p></p><p>The Wicked Abyss stood up slowly, his aura oppressive.</p><p></p><p>His gaze casually swept over Nangong Wenxin, Lai Qing, and Blood Demon Moon.</p><p></p><p>"Wicked Abyss, you've won."</p><p></p><p>Nangong Wenxin and Lai Qing took a deep breath and stepped aside, not wanting to compete with the Wicked Abyss anymore.</p><p></p><p>"Hahaha!"</p><p></p><p>Seeing this, the Wicked Abyss burst into wild laughter. At this moment, he was the absolute overlord of this place, full of vigor and heroic spirit.</p><p></p><p>Lu Changsheng was peeling an orange, seemingly an outsider, which was indeed the case.</p><p></p><p>He had no interest in this kind of "first place" competition among children. His only goal was to get into the top ten and become a Sword Servant.</p><p></p><p>"I disagree."</p><p></p><p>At this moment, a sudden voice rang out.</p><p></p><p>The Wicked Abyss' smile froze on his face.</p><p></p><p>Whether in the tea gathering or the distant audience seats, all eyes turned to a shiny bald head, filled with surprise and doubt.</p><p></p><p>"It's him!"</p><p></p><p>In the audience, Zhou Zhenjiang, his son Zhou Yuan, and Duan Jiuxiong, among others, all had their gazes fixed.</p><p></p><p>They had a deep impression of this bald prodigy.</p><p></p><p>That day outside the Sand Secret Realm, Zhou Zhenjiang had even caused him trouble. The Zhou Clan's young master, Zhou Yuan, was said to have been eliminated by this bald one.</p><p></p><p>The Blood Demon Sect Master's eyes darkened slightly, but it wasn't because of anything else.</p><p></p><p>It was because this bald prodigy's actions were somewhat disrespectful to his Blood Demon Sect. Didn't you see that the Nangong Clan and the Lai Clan had already backed down?</p><p></p><p>...</p><p></p><p>In the tea gathering,</p><p></p><p>Li Shuyan slowly walked in front of the Wicked Abyss, his timid eyes staring directly at him: "I disagree."</p><p></p><p>The crowd snapped back to their senses, staring in shock at Li Shuyan!</p><p></p><p>Fu Shiyu and the others were somewhat taken aback, and couldn't help but turn their heads to look at Lu Changsheng behind them.</p><p></p><p>"What are you all looking at me for?" Lu Changsheng asked puzzledly.</p><p></p><p>"Nothing, nothing." Fu Shiyu and the others quickly turned back.</p><p></p><p>At the same time, the Wicked Abyss looked at Li Shuyan with a somewhat cold and harsh gaze. "Are you sure?"</p><p></p><p>Li Shuyan nodded, "Yes."</p><p></p><p>Sensing the strange gazes around him, the Wicked Abyss' expression darkened. Just now, he was satisfied that no one dared to oppose him, but unexpectedly, a clown had immediately jumped out.</p><p></p><p>If it were Nangong Wenxin or the others, it would have been fine.</p><p></p><p>But it was actually an unknown Divine Yang Realm cultivator, which made him somewhat irritated.</p><p></p><p>"Alright, I'll satisfy you!"</p><p></p><p>The Wicked Abyss suddenly turned and walked towards the open space.</p><p></p><p>Although he was displeased in his heart, the rules of the Prodigy Tea Gathering stated that any prodigy could issue a challenge, and he couldn't refuse.</p><p></p><p>Soon, the two arrived at the open space, standing opposite each other.</p><p></p><p>All eyes were focused on them, and no one had high hopes for the bald one.</p><p></p><p>After all, his opponent was the number one hot-shot prodigy, the Wicked Abyss!</p><p></p><p>This bald one had courage, but it was a pity...</p><p></p><p>In the tea gathering, the battles between prodigies were a matter of life and death. If this bald one didn't have a powerful background that made the Blood Demon Sect wary, he might just end up dead...</p><p></p><p>"What's your name? Which force do you belong to? This Holy Son does not slay nameless nobodies!"</p><p></p><p>The Wicked Abyss stared at Li Shuyan, his eyes flickering with indifference.</p><p></p><p>If this bald one didn't have a background, then sorry...</p><p></p><p>Here is the full English translation of the Chinese excerpt:</p><p></p><p>...Dare to provoke him, then die!</p><p></p><p>New 69 book at shuxia.com</p><p></p><p>Hearing this, Li Shuyan paused...</p><p></p><p>He then glanced at the figure in blue robes in the tea gathering and said softly, "My name is Li Shuyan, and I am the disciple of the Venerable One."</p><p></p><p>Disciple of the Venerable One? What kind of nonsense is this?</p><p></p><p>The crowd was stunned, not knowing what the bald man was talking about.</p><p></p><p>The evil cultivator asks you to introduce your background, and you say this?</p><p></p><p>Only the Miao clan members and a few like Liu Tufuli Liang knew who Li Shuyan was referring to as the Venerable One.</p><p></p><p>Miao Hantian's heart was already excited. </p><p></p><p>If the evil cultivator and Li Shuyan clash, the Blood Demon Sect might recklessly rush towards the Venerable One.</p><p></p><p>As for Liu Tufuli Liang and the others, they were somewhat anxious. If Li Shuyan and the evil cultivator clash, there was a high chance that Senior Lu would also confront the Blood Demon Sect.</p><p></p><p>Although Senior Lu's Profound Celestial Realm cultivation was very strong, facing the mighty Blood Demon Sect might still be insufficient.</p><p></p><p>"Hehe, this Holy Son understands now," the evil cultivator said, licking the corner of his mouth with a bloodthirsty smile.</p><p></p><p>The Ancient Wasteland has no major power with the surname Li... Since you have no background, then die.</p><p></p><p>Seeing the evil cultivator's murderous intent fully displayed, his aura surging, Li Shuyan suddenly asked, "Wait a moment, I want to ask, in a battle between Heavenly Emperors, is it a fight to the death?"</p><p></p><p>The crowd was stunned. Who would need to ask that? Were they just playing around? Or was this bald man already cowardly?</p><p></p><p>At this time, Duan Jiuniong in the audience burst out laughing, "Correct, in a battle between Heavenly Emperors, it is a fight to the death! No one is allowed to interfere!"</p><p></p><p>Li Shuyan nodded, indicating that he understood, then raised his eyes and stared intently at the evil cultivator!</p><p></p><p>His lifeless eyes had now become like those of a hawk, with a flickering flame burning within that captivated the soul.</p><p></p><p>Seeing the drastic change in the bald man's aura, the crowd's gazes sharpened.</p><p></p><p>The evil cultivator was also inexplicably shaken by Li Shuyan's gaze, and then angrily shouted, "Come, let's fight!!"</p><p></p><p>Boom!</p><p></p><p>Spiritual energy erupted in the square, and three resplendent solar shadows suddenly rose up behind the evil cultivator!</p><p></p><p>Scorching heat instantly permeated the square!</p><p></p><p>Late Profound Celestial Realm!!</p><p></p><p>Wow!</p><p></p><p>Both the tea gathering and the audience were in an uproar.</p><p></p><p>No one had expected the evil cultivator to actually be a late Profound Celestial Realm existence, not even a million years old!</p><p></p><p>Terrifying to this extent!</p><p></p><p>Such talent was even approaching the level of some Heavenly Emperors of the Eight Great Ancient Clans!</p><p></p><p>This is why the Ancient Wasteland Sword Clan holds the Heavenly Emperor Convention every two hundred thousand years, to gather all the Heavenly Emperors under their control, in order to forever maintain their hegemonic position.</p><p></p><p>Li Shuyan was unperturbed, and a faint smile gradually appeared on his lips. With a boom, a solar halo appeared behind him!</p><p></p><p>The Profound Celestial Realm cultivation made the crowd shake their heads helplessly. </p><p></p><p>The Profound Celestial Realm was already very powerful, but unfortunately, one solar halo facing three solar halos had no chance of winning.</p><p></p><p>Only Zhou Zhenjiang and Zhou Yuan in the audience knew that Li Shuyan was not that simple, as he was a Body Cultivator!</p><p></p><p>Suddenly, fierce flames erupted from Li Shuyan's body, turning him into a human torch!</p><p></p><p>Before the crowd could be amazed, Li Shuyan's toes suddenly touched the ground, and he shot out explosively!</p><p></p><p>The ground he had just stood on instantly collapsed, with spider web-like cracks rapidly spreading in all directions!</p><p></p><p>It was unimaginable how much violent force was contained in that single step!</p><p></p><p>And there was not the slightest fluctuation of spiritual energy...</p><p></p><p>Body Cultivation!</p><p></p><p>The crowd was stunned, and many stood up, looking over.</p><p></p><p>Rushing forward, Li Shuyan stared at the clearly stunned evil cultivator and grinned:</p><p></p><p>"One move... I'll defeat you!"</p>

        <h1>Chapter 537</h1>
        <div class="content">
            <p>Here is the full English translation of the Chinese excerpt:</p><p></p><p>"Haha, in this round of recruiting disciples, your performance has been outstanding, Song Ren. What reward would you like this old master to give you?" </p><p></p><p>The elder of the Tianwu Sect said with a smile.</p><p></p><p>Wang Shu looked at Song Ren in front of him, feeling very satisfied in his heart.</p><p></p><p>The Earth Martial Vein! </p><p></p><p>This time, the entire Star Luo Empire had only two Earth Martial Veins appear, and one of them was brought back by his subordinate Song Ren.</p><p></p><p>This made Wang Shu very respected among the elders, and he also received praise from the Sect Master. Of course he had to reward Song Ren well.</p><p></p><p>Song Ren bowed respectfully, forcing a smile on his face: "Elder, Song Ren has something to say."</p><p></p><p>After much inner turmoil, Song Ren decided to just say it out. After all, he was not the only one present that day, and the truth would eventually come out! </p><p></p><p>It would be better to just state it directly, otherwise if it was discovered later, Song Ren would be completely ruined!</p><p></p><p>Oh?</p><p></p><p>Wang Shu raised his eyebrows and waved his hand, smiling: "Since you contributed greatly this time, just speak up!"</p><p></p><p>"No, no, that's not it." Song Ren swallowed hard, carefully saying: "Elder, what Song Ren wants to say is, in Jixiang Town, there are two more Earth Martial Veins..."</p><p></p><p>"Oh, two more Earth Martial Veins, is that a small matter...? What?! Say that again!" </p><p></p><p>Wang Shu suddenly stood up, his face full of disbelief.</p><p></p><p>"There are two more Earth Martial Veins, everything Song Ren said is true." </p><p></p><p>Song Ren said with difficulty, afraid that Wang Shu wouldn't believe him, so he emphasized it again.</p><p></p><p>Wang Shu took a deep breath, stunned. A single town actually had three Earth Martial Veins? This was completely absurd!</p><p></p><p>After staring at Song Ren for a long moment, Wang Shu frowned and paced back and forth with his hands behind his back.</p><p></p><p>After a brief silence, Wang Shu spoke in a serious tone: "Song Ren, tell me the details of what happened."</p><p></p><p>As an elder of the Tianwu Sect, Wang Shu was naturally not a fool.</p><p></p><p>He wouldn't simply ask Song Ren why he didn't bring back the other two Earth Martial Veins to the Tianwu Sect.</p><p></p><p>Anyone with half a brain could tell that the matter was not that simple.</p><p></p><p>"Elder, please understand!" </p><p></p><p>Seeing that Wang Shu did not blame him, the trembling Song Ren couldn't help but heave a sigh of relief.</p><p></p><p>Indeed, being honest was the right choice. Elder Wang Shu was truly a reasonable person.</p><p></p><p>He then bitterly smiled and said, "In that Jixiang Town, there is a powerful Book Cultivator, and those two Earth Martial Veins both belong to his disciples."</p><p></p><p>He quickly added, "Even Huang Xuan, and the other eleven ordinary Martial Veins, are all disciples of that Book Cultivator."</p><p></p><p>A powerful Book Cultivator?</p><p></p><p>Wang Shu's eyes narrowed slightly, it seems Song Ren had clashed with that Book Cultivator...</p><p></p><p>Otherwise, Song Ren wouldn't have failed to bring back those two Earth Martial Veins.</p><p></p><p>But Song Ren didn't seem to have any injuries at all?</p><p></p><p>It seems that Book Cultivator, although powerful, was not much stronger than Song Ren, and was not a major concern.</p><p></p><p>Wang Shu immediately asked, "Song Ren, I presume you've fought with that Book Cultivator? How is his cultivation? Have you figured out his background? Is he from the Northern Star Academy?"</p><p></p><p>At this, Song Ren's face became extremely embarrassed as he lowered his head: "Elder, Song Ren did not actually fight with that Book Cultivator..."</p><p></p><p>Huh?</p><p></p><p>Wang Shu was dumbfounded!</p><p></p><p>No fight?</p><p></p><p>Was Song Ren just mocking him?</p><p></p><p>Wang Shu's face darkened as he sternly said, "Song Ren!!"</p><p></p><p>Song Ren jumped in fright, hastily kneeling and exclaiming, "Elder, please do not be angry. You do not know, that Book Cultivator's aura alone completely suppressed Song Ren's! Song Ren had a premonition that if he fought, he would have been utterly defeated!"</p><p></p><p>"Nonsense!" Wang Shu's forehead was covered in black lines.</p><p></p><p>What kind of nonsense was this? This Song Ren, perhaps he had been too lenient with him.</p><p></p><p>If he didn't know that Song Ren wouldn't dare to lie, he would have even suspected that those two Earth Martial Veins were fabricated by Song Ren.</p><p></p><p>Song Ren's face turned bitter, he knew the Elder wouldn't believe him. It was indeed a bit absurd, but this was his personal experience, the facts were just like this!</p><p></p><p>"Hmph, Song Ren, you will immediately accompany me to Jixiang Town. If I find out you lied, you'll be in big trouble! Go!" </p><p></p><p>Wang Shu's expression fluctuated for a moment before he swept his sleeve and walked out.</p><p></p><p>Seeing this, Song Ren hurriedly followed by Wang Shu's side, saying:</p><p></p><p>"Elder, should we report this to the Sect Master instead? We..."</p><p></p><p>"Insolent! If you say another useless word, I'll cut out your tongue!" Wang Shu's tone became harsh.</p><p></p><p>Song Ren dared not speak anymore, his face extremely unsightly, with a hint of fear.</p><p></p><p>Here is the full English translation of the Chinese excerpt:</p><p></p><p>Fearful.</p><p></p><p>He seriously doubted that Elder Wangsu was not a match for that book cultivator!</p><p></p><p>With Elder Wangsu's temperament, if he were to clash with that book cultivator, wouldn't he be implicated?</p><p></p><p>Perhaps feeling that his tone was a bit heavy, Wangsu sighed:</p><p></p><p>"Song Ren, the two earth martial veins need to be personally brought back to the Tianwu Sect by us, so that we can receive greater rewards. If we report it upwards, the rewards will be greatly discounted. The Elder believes that by saying this, you can understand."</p><p></p><p>Wangsu naturally also had ambitions. Now that he was an outer sect elder, as long as he brought back the two earth martial veins, he would be able to lay a good foundation for his future promotion to inner sect elder.</p><p></p><p>Song Ren silently nodded and sincerely said, "Elder, Song Ren is not mocking you, nor dares to deceive you. Everything I said before was true... Elder, don't blame Song Ren for speaking bluntly, but if you go up against that book cultivator, I'm afraid you won't be his match!"</p><p></p><p>Wangsu's footsteps paused, and this time he didn't scold Song Ren, but instead frowned deeply, as if pondering and considering.</p><p></p><p>He then asked:</p><p></p><p>"What is the attitude of that book cultivator you mentioned? Is he very adamant about keeping those two martial dao talents?"</p><p></p><p>As he spoke, Wangsu became puzzled and asked, "But how did that Huang Xuan come back with you?"</p><p></p><p>Song Ren swallowed and replied, "Elder, that book cultivator didn't forcibly retain them, but rather... those two earth martial vein children themselves were unwilling to join the Tianwu Sect, saying something about their hearts being with the way of the book."</p><p></p><p>Oh? It turned out to be like this!</p><p></p><p>Wangsu's expression softened, and he now had a grasp of the situation. Seeing it this way, that book cultivator also had reservations and didn't dare to offend his Tianwu Sect without reason.</p><p></p><p>"The Elder understands now. Since that book cultivator has no intention of forcibly retaining them, it's easy. The Elder will personally bring some gifts and have a talk with him. As the saying goes, 'don't hit a smiling face,' I believe he will also understand the situation."</p><p></p><p>"And there is a simple method, which is to persuade those two earth martial vein children, or even try to find a way through their families..."</p><p></p><p>Wangsu smiled with certainty.</p><p></p><p>Seeing that Wangsu was not planning to use force, but rather adopt a conciliatory approach, Song Ren finally felt somewhat relieved.</p><p></p><p>This method was indeed feasible. As long as those two children were willing to come to the Tianwu Sect, given the book cultivator's previous behavior, he would definitely not obstruct them.</p><p></p><p>"Let's go, immediately head to Jixiang Town, don't let other sects snatch the disciples our Tianwu Sect has set its eyes on!" Wangsu said coldly.</p><p></p><p>Song Ren was taken aback. "Elder, other sects shouldn't have received the news so quickly, right?"</p><p></p><p>"Hmph, you underestimate them. If my guess is correct, a few sects have already received the news and are rushing to Jixiang Town! Enough talk, let's go! You lead the way!"</p><p></p><p>The next moment, Wangsu, who had come out to the courtyard, grabbed Song Ren and flew out of the sect.</p><p></p><p>......</p><p></p><p>As the sun was setting in the west,</p><p></p><p>At a lake outside Jixiang Town,</p><p></p><p>"Mr. Lu, you were right, there were indeed many big fish at noon, haha!" </p><p></p><p>Old Xu smiled as he placed the fish in the net, then cast his line again with a chuckle.</p><p></p><p>Lu Changsheng inexplicably looked up at the sky and smiled. "Old Xu, it's this time of day, you should be going back to your restaurant. I bet there are a lot of customers waiting for you."</p><p></p><p>Old Xu was momentarily conflicted.</p><p></p><p>But just then, the float moved again!</p><p></p><p>Old Xu hurriedly lowered his voice and said, "Forget it, forget it, Mr. Lu. Business isn't that bad this time."</p><p></p><p>He then focused on his fishing again.</p><p></p><p>At the same time, a group of figures suddenly descended from the sky and lightly landed behind Lu Changsheng and Old Xu!</p><p></p><p>Lu Changsheng seemed as if he hadn't noticed at all, continuing to focus on his fishing.</p><p></p><p>"Is that Jixiang Town ahead? I've heard that earth martial veins have appeared in the town, and the Tianwu Sect has taken one, leaving two more. Is that so?" </p><p></p><p>The indifferent question broke the silence around them.</p><p></p><p>This sudden voice startled Old Xu, causing him to tremble and nearly drop his fishing rod. The fish that was about to bite the hook was scared away.</p><p></p><p>Old Xu's expression changed from shock to grief, then from grief to anger!</p><p></p><p>His beloved fish had been disturbed, causing it to escape the hook, making Old Xu lose his reason!</p><p></p><p>He abruptly turned around, raised his fishing rod, and charged forward, roaring, "Give me back my big fish!!!"</p>

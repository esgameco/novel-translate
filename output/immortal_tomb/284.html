        <h1>Chapter 284</h1>
        <div class="content">
            <p>Here is the full English translation of the Chinese excerpt:</p><p></p><p>"Was it a misunderstanding?" Luchang Sheng said with a leisurely smile.</p><p></p><p>"Ahem." Li Shuyan looked slightly embarrassed.</p><p></p><p>Luchang Sheng drained the cup of wine, stood up, picked up the bronze mask and put it on his face, saying, "Since I have nothing to do, I'll take you to improve your strength. Consider yourself lucky, because if it were the old days when I ran the tavern and clinic, I wouldn't have had so much free time."</p><p></p><p>A look of joy appeared on Li Shuyan's face. "Thank you, Master!"</p><p></p><p>The next moment, Luchang Sheng waved his sleeve and disappeared with Li Shuyan.</p><p></p><p>...</p><p></p><p>On an unnamed mountain peak.</p><p></p><p>A spatial rift was torn open, and Luchang Sheng walked out of it with Li Shuyan!</p><p></p><p>Li Shuyan staggered a bit, quickly stabilizing his stance.</p><p></p><p>As soon as he regained his senses, an intense scorching heat enveloped his body, even hotter than the twin suns of Ouyang Zui ten years ago!</p><p></p><p>Just as he was about to instinctively use his spiritual energy to protect himself,</p><p></p><p>Luchang Sheng calmly said, "Endure it with your physical body."</p><p></p><p>Li Shuyan was startled and dared not use his spiritual energy.</p><p></p><p>Feeling the scorching temperature on his skin, sweat instantly beaded on his forehead.</p><p></p><p>Li Shuyan gritted his teeth slightly, then looked up to see where the master had brought him. He was shocked to find that they were on an extremely high mountain peak, and the scorching heat on his skin was coming from the massive volcanic crater in front of them!</p><p></p><p>At this moment, the volcanic crater was spewing thick smoke, about to erupt.</p><p></p><p>"I brought you here to temper your body, as your slow cultivation progress is directly related to your physical weakness," Luchang Sheng said calmly while looking at the volcanic crater.</p><p></p><p>Li Shuyan was slightly taken aback. His physique was not weak, after all, he had once condensed a Buddha's body. However, since he had given the relic to Huihai, his Buddha's body was gone. But the foundation was still there, so his physique should be much stronger than ordinary people.</p><p></p><p>Luchang Sheng glanced at him and suddenly lightly punched towards him!</p><p></p><p>Boom!</p><p></p><p>Li Shuyan was caught off guard, and of course, defense was useless. He was sent flying and crashed heavily onto the scorching mountain rocks!</p><p></p><p>"Pah!" He coughed up a mouthful of fresh blood, and many of his bones were broken.</p><p></p><p>As for Xuan, it had already freed itself from Li Shuyan and was floating behind Luchang Sheng, avoiding any harm.</p><p></p><p>"If you want to become stronger, you must first overcome your arrogance and impatience. I said your physique is weak, so it is weak. What, are you stronger than me or do you understand better than me?" Luchang Sheng asked.</p><p></p><p>Li Shuyan trembled as he got up, bowing and saying, "The master is right."</p><p></p><p>"You can still stand up, it seems I went too easy on you." Luchang Sheng said with a leisurely laugh.</p><p></p><p>With that, he lightly punched towards Li Shuyan again.</p><p></p><p>Naturally, Li Shuyan was powerless to resist, and was sent flying again, this time lying there on the verge of death, with blood continuously flowing from the corners of his mouth, his eyes almost rolling back.</p><p></p><p>If it weren't for the excruciating pain throughout his body and the scorching temperature of the ground deeply stimulating his nerves, he might have already passed out.</p><p></p><p>"Can't even withstand two punches? I didn't use much force," Luchang Sheng said indifferently.</p><p></p><p>"Cough... cough, Master, Shuyan really can't go on..." Li Shuyan said weakly while lying there.</p><p></p><p>"Can't even do this, you're not even as good as Luo Gu from Yanwu Town," Luchang Sheng mocked slightly.</p><p></p><p>Li Shuyan's body trembled, and he tried to get up but couldn't, as if countless hands were grabbing him from the ground!</p><p></p><p>"If you can stand up and take my third punch, I'll help you quickly become stronger," Luchang Sheng said again.</p><p></p><p>Hearing this, Li Shuyan's pupils shrank, and his heart was pounding furiously like being struck by a heavy hammer!</p><p></p><p>He gritted his teeth...</p><p></p><p>Here is the full English translation of the Chinese excerpt:</p><p></p><p>The teeth clenched, his fist tightened, his face twisted into a terrifying expression.</p><p></p><p>"Ah!!!"</p><p></p><p>With a low roar like a wild beast, he trembled as he stood up, swaying unsteadily!</p><p></p><p>"Sir, the book can be returned!!"</p><p></p><p>But what came towards him was a powerful punch, and he was sent flying, unconscious.</p><p></p><p>Lu Changsheng walked over, looked down at Li Shueyan, and with a finger, a stream of light entered his body, frantically repairing his injuries.</p><p></p><p>In no time, Li Shueyan was stirred awake by the scorching sensation, and the first thing he saw was that deep bronze mask.</p><p></p><p>He was then shocked to discover that his severe injuries had been completely restored!</p><p></p><p>Even, even his physique seemed to have grown stronger...</p><p></p><p>He couldn't help but ask, "Sir, how long was I unconscious?"</p><p></p><p>"Not long, just ten breaths," Lu Changsheng replied calmly.</p><p></p><p>Li Shueyan: "..."</p><p></p><p>"Since you're better now, get up and continue," Lu Changsheng said, hands behind his back.</p><p></p><p>Li Shueyan's face stiffened, but he silently got up.</p><p></p><p>Through this, he understood his master's intentions - such a peerless figure would naturally not be idling to torment a novice like him.</p><p></p><p>His master's actions were to solidify his physical body!</p><p></p><p>Boom!</p><p></p><p>The next moment, the powerful punch came again!</p><p></p><p>...</p><p></p><p>And so, atop this volcanic peak, Lu Changsheng would drink his wine while punching Li Shueyan again and again.</p><p></p><p>Whenever Li Shueyan passed out, Lu Changsheng would help him recover, and then they would continue.</p><p></p><p>Time flew by in this manner, and in the blink of an eye, ten years had passed...</p><p></p><p>On this day, Li Shueyan was waiting with his eyes closed for the punch to come, but he found that it never arrived. Instead, he heard Lu Changsheng's question,</p><p></p><p>"How do you feel about your physique now?"</p><p></p><p>Li Shueyan opened his eyes and quickly examined himself. To his astonishment, he discovered that both his internal organs and his bones and meridians had undergone earth-shattering changes!</p><p></p><p>The visible solidity was countless times more than his initial Buddha-like body!</p><p></p><p>Li Shueyan had not yet tested this brand-new physique in actual combat, so he didn't know how much his combat power had improved.</p><p></p><p>"Sir, how long have we been on this peak?" Li Shueyan couldn't help but ask.</p><p></p><p>"Ten years," Lu Changsheng replied indifferently.</p><p></p><p>Ten, ten years...</p><p></p><p>Li Shueyan was shaken by this, not because of the length of time, as cultivation knew no age, and ten years were nothing. But this particular ten years was different - it was a time when this peerless expert had been helping him cultivate day after day.</p><p></p><p>"Thank you, sir!" Li Shueyan hurriedly bowed, unaffected by the scorching ground, as he had long since grown accustomed to this temperature.</p><p></p><p>Lu Changsheng's robes fluttered as he turned his head to look towards the volcano's mouth, a smile on his face:</p><p></p><p>"Do you think this is the end? No, these ten years were just to lay the foundation for you."</p><p></p><p>Li Shueyan's lips moved slightly as he looked up at the green-robed figure, respectfully asking, "What does the sir mean?"</p><p></p><p>Lu Changsheng conjured a scroll and tossed it over.</p><p></p><p>Li Shueyan quickly caught it with both hands and slowly unrolled it. The first thing that caught his eye was four characters that seemed to glow with fiery light - "The Myriad Forging Technique!"</p><p></p><p>Lu Changsheng walked to the edge of the volcano, peering down at the fiery red world below, and said indifferently,</p><p></p><p>"If you can cultivate this Myriad Forging Technique to completion, then even if your cultivation hasn't advanced, even Xian Yang Realm cultivators will find it difficult to harm you."</p><p></p><p>Li Shueyan's refined eyelids twitched, looking at the Myriad Forging Technique in disbelief - this, this was so powerful?</p><p></p><p>But Lu Changsheng's next words made his scalp tingle,</p><p></p><p>"I'm talking about Xian Yang Realm cultivators with three blazing suns."</p>

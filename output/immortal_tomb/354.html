        <h1>Chapter 354</h1>
        <div class="content">
            <p>Here is the full English translation of the excerpt from the Chinese novel:</p><p></p><p>In the palace of the Lord of the Human City...</p><p></p><p>Han Jinlong and Yan Jueyi's expressions were somewhat shocked.</p><p></p><p>Zhao Di actually lost without even making a single move!</p><p></p><p>For a moment, the two of them were even stunned and forgot about the bet.</p><p></p><p>"King Jinlun, are you sure that Lu Xiaoyou is at the Shenxuan Realm?" </p><p></p><p>Yan Jueyi's expression towards Han Jinlong was somewhat grave.</p><p></p><p>Han Jinlong pursed his lips and said, "This King had already asked Lu Xiaoyou beforehand, and he said he was not at the Shenyou Realm, and that participating in the Seven-Colored Glazed Pagoda required the cultivation of the Shenxuan Realm. Since Lu Xiaoyou dared to participate, he must be truly at that level, and there will be a test later."</p><p></p><p>"Then this Lu Xiaoyou's Shenxuan Realm is indeed quite formidable..." Yan Jueyi said in a puzzled manner.</p><p></p><p>"Eh~ Qunsheng, you don't need to worry too much. Among the powerful alien races ranked high on the Myriad Tribes Ranking, there are even some peak Shenxuan Realm experts who can contend with the Shenyou Realm, so what's the big deal?" </p><p></p><p>Han Jinlong shrugged and laughed.</p><p></p><p>Yan Jueyi glanced at him and sighed, "You said those are the alien races ranked high on the Myriad Tribes Ranking, how do we humans compare?"</p><p></p><p>As soon as these words fell, to Yan Jueyi's astonished gaze, Han Jinlong suddenly stood up and fiercely shouted, "What's wrong with the alien races ranked high? Are we humans that inferior? Qunsheng, your self-deprecation goes against your usual bellicose disposition!"</p><p></p><p>"And on top of that, Lu Xiaoyou has just arrived at the Divine-Demon Battlefield. Other than being able to confirm he is human, what else do you know about his background?"</p><p></p><p>"The boundless void is so vast, with so many races, and we humans are also so numerous. Can you be sure that all the heavenly talents of our human race have gathered at the Divine-Demon Battlefield?"</p><p></p><p>"Hmph!"</p><p></p><p>Yan Jueyi snapped out of it, looking at Han Jinlong with surprise and doubt for a long while, then stood up and pushed him back into his seat, saying helplessly, "King Jinlun, don't be angry. It was this Saint who was overly self-deprecating. As one of the human overlords, my previous words were indeed inappropriate."</p><p></p><p>Hearing Yan Jueyi say this, Han Jinlong felt much more at ease in his heart.</p><p></p><p>At this time, Yan Jueyi smiled and said, "But King Jinlun, what's wrong with you today? You actually have such a heroic spirit in your heart?"</p><p></p><p>Upon hearing this, Han Jinlong recalled the dream he had after drinking the Dream-Inducing Liquor two months ago, as well as the words Lu Changsheng had said to him, and sighed, "Qunsheng, if this King says that we humans are the foremost of all tribes, do you believe it?"</p><p></p><p>Yan Jueyi's gaze sharpened, first glancing up at the Myriad Tribes Ranking in the sky, then looking at Han Jinlong, frowning and saying, "You... are you alright?"</p><p></p><p>He felt that Han Jinlong had changed a bit, quite different from the impression he had of him.</p><p></p><p>Han Jinlong's face darkened as he said impatiently, "You're the one who's not alright, your whole family is not alright. Just directly answer this King whether you believe it or not!"</p><p></p><p>Yan Jueyi remained silent and did not speak.</p><p></p><p>Han Jinlong saw that Yan Jueyi did not believe it, so he immediately picked up the wine cup and drank by himself, not intending to continue the conversation, because he himself was not entirely certain.</p><p></p><p>But it was only a bit of uncertainty... for some reason, the agreement in his heart occupied the vast majority.</p><p></p><p>"Where did you hear this from?"</p><p></p><p>Yan Jueyi suddenly looked up and asked.</p><p></p><p>But as soon as he asked, he furrowed his brows, as if he had thought of something, his eyes flickering as he asked, "Could it be that Lu Changsheng?"</p><p></p><p>Oh?</p><p></p><p>Han Jinlong immediately beamed, nodding and saying, "That's right."</p><p></p><p>Yan Jueyi wanted to say something, but was stopped by Han Jinlong raising his hand, who smiled and said, "Don't be in a hurry. Before that, this King invites you to drink a good wine!"</p><p></p><p>Saying that, he took out the Dream-Inducing Liquor.</p><p></p><p>Here is my translation of the Chinese excerpt:</p><p></p><p>Then he picked up the wine jar and poured half a cup for Yan Jueyi's wine cup, and quickly put it away.</p><p></p><p>Yan Jueyi had wanted to ask a question, but after smelling the special wine aroma, his mind was completely drawn to the wine in front of him.</p><p></p><p>He couldn't help but swallow, and said, "King Jin Lun, where did you get this wine? All these years of co-governing the human city with you, and you've been hiding such good wine all this time!"</p><p></p><p>Towards the end, his tone even carried some anger.</p><p></p><p>Han Jinlin chuckled embarrassedly, "Drink it first, then I'll tell you about it."</p><p></p><p>Yan Jueyi picked up the wine cup solemnly and asked, "What's the name?"</p><p></p><p>"Dream Entrance," Han Jinlong smiled.</p><p></p><p>"Dream Entrance..." Yan Jueyi looked down at the wine in the cup, first taking a sip, then his eyes suddenly lit up as he exclaimed "Good wine!" and drained the cup in one gulp!</p><p></p><p>Han Jinlong watched the closed-eyed Yan Jueyi with a smile.</p><p></p><p>He had let him drink the Dream Entrance first, wanting him to experience the vivid dream he had that day. </p><p></p><p>That was a scene of the human race's domination on the divine-demonic battlefield!</p><p></p><p>But Han Jinlong did not know that the dreams created by Dream Entrance were not singular, but varied from person to person.</p><p></p><p>Han Jinlong was smiling, but suddenly he couldn't smile anymore, his expression freezing, because he saw Yan Jueyi's breathing become more and more rapid, his complexion paler and paler, until he was even bloodless!</p><p></p><p>Seeing this scene, Han Jinlong was stunned, what's going on?</p><p></p><p>The dream of the human race's domination shouldn't be inspiring, exhilarating, and proud?</p><p></p><p>Yan Jueyi's subsequent strange behavior finally made Han Jinlong unable to sit still, and he abruptly stood up!</p><p></p><p>What did he see? </p><p></p><p>He saw Yan Jueyi's expression become angry, frenzied, and even tears of blood flowed from the corners of his eyes!!</p><p></p><p>"Cudgel Saint! Cudgel Saint!!"</p><p></p><p>Han Jinlong panicked, quickly stepping in front of Yan Jueyi and pushing him, trying to pull him out of the dream!</p><p></p><p>At this moment, Yan Jueyi suddenly opened his eyes and regained consciousness.</p><p></p><p>He looked at the anxious Han Jinlong in front of him, and his heartstrings loosened, his expression gradually returning to calm. After a moment, he shook his head and sighed:</p><p></p><p>"It's good that it was just a dream, such a vivid dream, the Saint was deeply trapped in it without realizing it."</p><p></p><p>Han Jinlong saw that Yan Jueyi had awakened, and his heart also relaxed. He then sat back down opposite him and asked in a serious tone:</p><p></p><p>"Wasn't your dream about the human race's domination of the divine-demonic battlefield? Just now, your expression was too exaggerated, and there was even blood on your face..."</p><p></p><p>Yan Jueyi was taken aback by this, and suddenly felt the wetness on his face. He quickly wiped it with his hand, and fresh blood became visible.</p><p></p><p>He was stunned for a long time, wiping all the blood on his face, not caring at all.</p><p></p><p>Finally, he looked at the opposite Han Jinlong and smiled, "Where did this wine come from?"</p><p></p><p>Han Jinlong: "It was also given by Lu Xiaoyou. I drank this Dream Entrance at the time, and dreamed of the scene of the human race's domination of the divine-demonic battlefield! You can't say, it was too vivid!"</p><p></p><p>Yan Jueyi suddenly asked, "Did you really dream of it?"</p><p></p><p>Han Jinlong raised his eyebrows: "What, you think I'm lying to you? You just drank the wine too, maybe you dreamed of something different from what I dreamed of, but just tell me if it was vivid or not."</p><p></p><p>"Vivid." Yan Jueyi did not deny it, and then continued, "But it was just a dream, a kind of wine that can lead people into a vivid dream, there's nothing special about it, and it's impossible to come true!"</p><p></p><p>Han Jinlong chuckled: "Of course it's impossible to come true. I originally wanted to let you experience the dream of the human race's domination first, and then tell you about Lu Xiaoyou's words about the human race, but now I'll just tell you directly."</p>

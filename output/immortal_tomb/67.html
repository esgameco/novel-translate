        <h1>Chapter 67</h1>
        <div class="content">
            <p>Here is the full English translation of the Chinese excerpt:</p><p></p><p>The Demonic Realm. ‚Ä¢._.‚Ä¢‚Ä¢¬¥¬Ø``‚Ä¢.¬∏¬∏.‚Ä¢` 69Shuùïè.com `‚Ä¢.¬∏¬∏.‚Ä¢¬¥¬¥¬Ø`‚Ä¢‚Ä¢._.‚Ä¢</p><p></p><p>"The Demon Sovereign didn't say to go to the mortal realm, it's only been three years, how come he's back already? Is he preparing to wage war? Hehe, it seems you also think that this is a good opportunity for Zhang Youdao to ascend and break through the tribulation."</p><p></p><p>In the spacious main hall, Tiger Battle and Jie Wuqing were sitting across from each other.</p><p></p><p>Jie Wuqing said indifferently, "Tiger Battle, stand down."</p><p></p><p>Tiger Battle's eyes flashed sharply as he asked in a solemn tone, "What do you mean?"</p><p></p><p>"I've met Lu Changsheng, but I can't figure out his intentions, so it's best not to act rashly for now."</p><p></p><p>"Lu Changsheng? You mean that mysterious cultivator the Sovereign encountered in the Immortal Mausoleum?"</p><p></p><p>"That's right."</p><p></p><p>"Uh... how are you sure that was Lu Changsheng? Oh right, he has a turtle on his shoulder, did you see that turtle?"</p><p></p><p>"No."</p><p></p><p>"Hehe."</p><p></p><p>"What are you laughing about?"</p><p></p><p>"You must have mistaken the person, Lu Changsheng has a turtle."</p><p></p><p>"..."</p><p></p><p>Jie Wuqing fell silent.</p><p></p><p>She didn't know why this Tiger Battle always kept coming back to the topic of the turtle.</p><p></p><p>Jie Wuqing didn't say anything else, but in Tiger Battle's puzzled gaze, she raised her right sleeve with her left hand and shook it, revealing it to be empty.</p><p></p><p>Tiger Battle abruptly stood up, asking with surprise, "Your right arm..."</p><p></p><p>"Was severed by that Lu Changsheng, and there is a strange power lingering around the stump, so my arm won't grow back or reattach," Jie Wuqing said indifferently.</p><p></p><p>Tiger Battle slowly sat back down, saying solemnly, "I didn't expect there to be such a formidable expert hidden in the Spiritual Dust Realm. But don't worry, when we launch the war, I will personally help you get your revenge and make that Lu Changsheng pay the price."</p><p></p><p>Jie Wuqing was taken aback. She didn't expect that after she had said all that, Tiger Battle would still be plotting to seize the Immortal Mausoleum.</p><p></p><p>"Do you think if Lu Changsheng intervenes, we can still succeed?" Jie Wuqing said through gritted teeth.</p><p></p><p>Tiger Battle smiled mysteriously, "Don't worry, I've recently allied with a partner, and Zhang Youdao is about to ascend soon. At that time, conquering the Spiritual Dust Realm will be a piece of cake."</p><p></p><p>"Do you remember that disappeared tomb in the Immortal Mausoleum group? That Lu Changsheng came out from there!" Jie Wuqing suddenly said emphatically.</p><p></p><p>Tiger Battle was stunned for a moment, then threw his head back and laughed heartily, "Hahaha!"</p><p></p><p>Jie Wuqing's expression changed slightly, "You!"</p><p></p><p>"Who told you that?" Tiger Battle asked with a smile.</p><p></p><p>"I had guessed it before, and then he confirmed it for me," Jie Wuqing said expressionlessly.</p><p></p><p>Clap, clap, clap, clap, clap, clap...</p><p></p><p>Tiger Battle clapped his hands, his face serious, "Mm-hmm, yes, whatever he says is the truth, but such a ridiculous thing, even you, the mighty Demon Sovereign, actually believe it... Tsk tsk."</p><p></p><p>Bang!</p><p></p><p>Jie Wuqing slammed her hand on the table and stood up, coldly saying, "Do as you please, if you want to attack, then go ahead, this time the Demon Realm will not interfere!"</p><p></p><p>After saying that, she was about to leave.</p><p></p><p>At this moment, Tiger Battle sneered, "Jie Wuqing, the matter of plotting the Immortal Mausoleum was first brought up by you, and now it's you who wants to back out. Isn't that laughable?"</p><p></p><p>Jie Wuqing paused.</p><p></p><p>Tiger Battle sneered, "You can back out if you want, I won't force you, but you have to promise me one thing."</p><p></p><p>"What is it?"</p><p></p><p>Tiger Battle said indifferently, "When I conquer the Spiritual Dust Realm and it's time to break open the Immortal Mausoleum, I need to borrow your blood-gathering magic technique. However, even if the Immortal Mausoleum is opened, you can only get a tenth of the secrets inside."</p><p></p><p>Jie Wuqing's eyes flashed as she said, "We'll talk about it again when you've conquered the Spiritual Dust Realm."</p><p></p><p>After saying that, her figure disappeared.</p><p></p><p>Tiger Battle fell silent for a moment, his face full of stubble.</p><p></p><p>Here is the full English translation of the Chinese excerpt:</p><p></p><p>A cold smile appeared on his face, and his icy words echoed through the grand hall!</p><p></p><p>"Before, without you in the Demon Realm, I would still hesitate, but now things are different, hehe... The longevity secret of the Immortal Mausoleum, I must obtain it!!"</p><p></p><p>.............</p><p></p><p>Daybreak, at the Qiyun Sect.</p><p></p><p>"Master, Master! Come out quickly!" </p><p></p><p>Tongxin and Lin Dong were shouting frantically outside the ancient crane's dwelling.</p><p></p><p>Boom.</p><p></p><p>The stone door of the dwelling opened, and the gloomy-faced Ancient Crane Lin walked out, scolding, </p><p></p><p>"What's with the commotion so early in the morning? Good thing I wasn't refining pills, or else you two little brats would have distracted me and I would have flayed you alive!"</p><p></p><p>Tongxin hurriedly said, "Master, the elders have gathered and are heading to your Elegant Courtyard! They have all sorts of gifts, as if they want to send presents to the Master! Won't they disturb the Master?"</p><p></p><p>"What?!" Ancient Crane Lin suddenly became alert, and instinctively asked, "How did they know the Master is staying in the Elegant Courtyard?"</p><p></p><p>Tongxin weakly raised his hand and mumbled, "It's... it's because I accidentally let it slip..."</p><p></p><p>Slap!</p><p></p><p>Ancient Crane Lin delivered an unprecedented, super-powerful smack on him.</p><p></p><p>The next moment, he hurriedly rushed away!</p><p></p><p>Only a sorrowful and anxious voice echoed back, </p><p></p><p>"If I can even come back alive from the Master's place this time, I will definitely eat you, this unfilial thing."</p><p></p><p>Lin Dong looked at the huge, red swollen lump on Tongxin's head with shock and worry, "Brother, that's such a big lump, does it hurt?"</p><p></p><p>Tongxin was in tears, not answering.</p><p></p><p>But Lin Dong understood,</p><p></p><p>His brother must be in great pain.</p><p></p><p>At the same time, outside the Elegant Courtyard.</p><p></p><p>A group of elders, carrying large and small packages, approached cautiously, deliberately holding the gifts in their hands to show sincerity.</p><p></p><p>At this moment, their faces were filled with utmost care and caution.</p><p></p><p>After all, the Transcendent Cultivator residing here was as revered as the Patriarch, and they couldn't afford to be careless.</p><p></p><p>"Snore snore..."</p><p></p><p>As the elders drew near, a rhythmic snoring sound suddenly reached their ears.</p><p></p><p>Their expressions changed, and they followed the sound, seeing a palm-sized turtle shell swaying on the courtyard gate.</p><p></p><p>"Huh, why is there a little turtle on the gate?"</p><p></p><p>"Shh!! Be careful with your words, have you ever seen an ordinary turtle snore like that? I think this must be the Master's spirit pet!"</p><p></p><p>"Ah, you're right! We should be more respectful."</p><p></p><p>"......"</p><p></p><p>The elders whispered among themselves, and after some discussion, one elder stepped forward, clearing his throat and respectfully calling out,</p><p></p><p>"Esteemed Master, we are the elders of the Qiyun Sect, and we have brought gifts to express our gratitude for the Master's invaluable guidance. That saying of 'My life is in my own hands' has deeply shocked and benefited us greatly. We will engrave it in our hearts and never forget it!"</p><p></p><p>The turtle's snoring stopped, and the eyes in the shell slowly opened, with a hint of confusion. He had already known these people were coming, but seeing them carrying large packages, he didn't immediately engage with them as expected.</p><p></p><p>But... "My life is in my own hands"? What's that supposed to mean?</p><p></p><p>Just then,</p><p></p><p>Ancient Crane Lin arrived at the scene with unprecedented speed, kneeling tremblingly in front of the courtyard, stammering,</p><p></p><p>"Master, Crane Lin is guilty..."</p><p></p><p>A moment of silence fell over the area,</p><p></p><p>Suddenly, a figure in blue robes materialized before Ancient Crane Lin.</p><p></p><p>Luchang did not pay attention to Ancient Crane Lin, but swept his gaze over the elders, smiling and asking,</p><p></p><p>"'My life is in my own hands'?"</p>

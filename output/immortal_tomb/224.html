        <h1>Chapter 224</h1>
        <div class="content">
            <p>Here is the full English translation of the Chinese excerpt:</p><p></p><p>Peng Fang was suddenly startled and frightened. ‚ô®üêö‚ûÖ‚ùæùêí ∞ùì§◊ê.ùêÇùïÜùê¶üêù‚ôó</p><p></p><p>His face turned from red to white, his lips trembling, wanting to say something but not daring to.</p><p></p><p>The four people of Su Qianghe saw Peng Fang's terrified look out of the corner of their eyes, and they were secretly delighted.</p><p></p><p>Hmph, you are in a high position of power, whether it's your official duties or your strength, you are stronger than us, we can't do anything to you, we've accepted that, but the Sect Master can.</p><p></p><p>However, the four of them could only be secretly delighted, not daring to show it on their faces, for if it was detected by the Elder, they would inevitably be bullied in the future.</p><p></p><p>Lu Changsheng said softly, "All these years, did you think I didn't know? This is just a small matter, I just didn't want to get involved."</p><p></p><p>Peng Fang was trembling, cold sweat seeping out of his forehead. He felt that his life had suddenly become uncertain.</p><p></p><p>The Sect Master's calm demeanor was too frightening. Could it be that he wanted to kill him?</p><p></p><p>Just as Peng Fang was imagining, </p><p></p><p>Lu Changsheng suddenly smiled and said, "Get up."</p><p></p><p>Peng Fang paused, almost unable to catch his breath, and then was delighted, thinking that the Sect Master didn't want to hold it against him.</p><p></p><p>Afterwards, the four of them stood up.</p><p></p><p>"Sit down," Lu Changsheng said.</p><p></p><p>The four of them quickly obeyed and sat down respectfully.</p><p></p><p>Lu Changsheng smiled and waved his sleeve, and a table full of wine jars appeared instantly!</p><p></p><p>"Sss‚Äî"</p><p></p><p>Peng Fang and the five of them sucked in a breath of cool air, their noses twitching frantically. Ah, there were three types of wine: Xihun Brew, Rumjun Brew, and Manqun Brew!</p><p></p><p>Wow, this time they were all here!</p><p></p><p>What did the Sect Master mean by this?</p><p></p><p>Although the five of them were staring fixedly at the table full of wine, almost drooling, they didn't dare to move before Lu Changsheng spoke.</p><p></p><p>"You five have done a good job in managing the sect, so these wines... you can share them," Lu Changsheng said leisurely.</p><p></p><p>The five of them were stunned, quickly standing up and bowing deeply, shouting, "Thank you, Sect Master!!"</p><p></p><p>"Peng Fang, don't be in a hurry to thank me yet," Lu Changsheng waved his hand, "You should take the least of these wines, as compensation for Shan and the others."</p><p></p><p>Peng Fang paused.</p><p></p><p>The other four, however, were overjoyed, discreetly glancing at the miserable Elder Peng!</p><p></p><p>Good, since you've been bullying us, you'll have to pay for it sooner or later!</p><p></p><p>"Sect Master, Peng Fang understands," Peng Fang quickly said respectfully.</p><p></p><p>The Sect Master didn't punish him for secretly hoarding the fine wines, which was already good enough. In front of Lu Changsheng, he didn't dare to say anything.</p><p></p><p>"Mm," Lu Changsheng nodded, standing up and instructing, "After the disciple recruitment is completed, prepare a banquet."</p><p></p><p>Huh? What's the purpose of preparing a banquet?</p><p></p><p>The five were puzzled, but were about to respond when they heard Lu Changsheng say again, "After the banquet, I will go on a wandering journey."</p><p></p><p>The five were startled, the Sect Master was leaving again?</p><p></p><p>This was so similar to when he was in Tianzhihen Qingxuan Town!</p><p></p><p>Except this time, it seemed he wouldn't be taking them with him.</p><p></p><p>Probably he would take Tongxin and Lin Dong, the two Holy Sons, after all...</p><p></p><p>But if the Sect Master left, and the two Holy Sons closest to him also left, what would be the meaning of Xiaoliao Sect? It would be like a headless group of dragons.</p><p></p><p>Lu Changsheng chuckled lightly,</p><p></p><p>"I will come back to Xiaoliao Sect from time to time, I have always been the Sect Master of Xiaoliao Sect."</p><p></p><p>The five of them heard this and felt relieved in their hearts.</p><p></p><p>"This time, I may take Tongxin with me, as for Lin Dong, let him stay in the sect, you five should support him well," Lu Changsheng said again.</p><p></p><p>Seeing Lu Changsheng say this, Peng Fang and the others finally settled in their hearts!</p><p></p><p>Since the Sect Master left one of the Holy Sons behind, it seemed he really wouldn't abandon Xiaoliao Sect.</p><p></p><p>As for why he would take Tongxin instead of Lin Dong, the five of them also had some guesses.</p><p></p><p>Probably it was because Tongxin was more mischievous in nature, while Lin Dong was...</p><p></p><p>Here is the full English translation of the Chinese excerpt:</p><p></p><p>The atmosphere was rather calm.</p><p></p><p>The new 69 book bar 99 shux.com</p><p></p><p>Compared to childlike innocence, Lin Dong was more suited to staying within the sect as the Holy Son, setting an example for the other disciples.</p><p></p><p>"Sect Master, we understand." The five people led by Peng Fang bowed.</p><p></p><p>"Mm, we'll be recruiting disciples in a few days, you all can go prepare." Lu Changsheng said indifferently.</p><p></p><p>However, the five people of Peng Fang seemed unable to move... </p><p></p><p>They were extremely embarrassed, looking at the wine on the table, their hearts in turmoil.</p><p></p><p>They didn't dare to take it in front of the Sect Master.</p><p></p><p>Huh?</p><p></p><p>Lu Changsheng was slightly surprised, and with a single glance, he knew their thoughts. He smiled and disappeared from his seat.</p><p></p><p>"Farewell, Sect Master!!"</p><p></p><p>The five were delighted, hurriedly bowing to see him off.</p><p></p><p>In a moment,</p><p></p><p>they began to frantically scramble!</p><p></p><p>Swoosh swoosh swoosh‚Äî</p><p></p><p>The wine on the table was all taken away.</p><p></p><p>Peng Fang looked at the four people squeezing and grimacing with some displeasure, this time he really suffered a loss.</p><p></p><p>He only took a few jars, he also wanted to take more, but this time he really didn't dare.</p><p></p><p>........</p><p></p><p>On the day the Xiao Yao Sect recruited disciples, there was a sea of people.</p><p></p><p>Not only were there celestial prodigies, but there were even Immortal Emperors and Immortal Lords who wanted to find a position in the Xiao Yao Sect...</p><p></p><p>It was truly exaggerated, truly fiercely competitive!</p><p></p><p>There were many cultivators who were resentful, complaining bitterly, "Senior! Big shot! You've already reached such a realm, where can't you find a place to eat? Why bother to compete with us, the rising newcomers, for food?"</p><p></p><p>Towards many similar gazes, the Immortal Emperors and Immortal Lords remained expressionless, at peace with themselves.</p><p></p><p>They were also thinking about their own future, isn't that reasonable?</p><p></p><p>The Xiao Yao Sect, as the number one sect in the Linglang Heavens, who wouldn't flock to it?</p><p></p><p>Who doesn't know the strength of the Xiao Yao Sect Master?</p><p></p><p>.........</p><p></p><p>The process of recruiting disciples, apart from the standards being higher, was the same as before, except for the addition of one test, the Heart Test.</p><p></p><p>Countless celestial prodigies who failed to pass the character requirements or had other intentions were stopped at this test.</p><p></p><p>They looked at the Xiao Yao Sect, which was within reach, sighed deeply towards the heavens, their hearts unbalanced, but they didn't dare to cause trouble.</p><p></p><p>"Those who have been eliminated, leave quickly, don't occupy the spot!"</p><p></p><p>"Hey~ that blind one, what are you looking at, I'm talking to you, look at me again and I'll blow out your eyes!"</p><p></p><p>Cai Xu and Huang Bin walked through the field with their heads held high, driving away many celestial prodigies who were still unwilling to leave after being eliminated.</p><p></p><p>The celestial prodigies became increasingly displeased, two Earthly Immortal realm cultivators actually dared to boss them around.</p><p></p><p>When had they ever suffered such humiliation? If they weren't Xiao Yao Sect disciples, they would have slashed these two Earthly Immortals to death!</p><p></p><p>"Yes, yes, yes, Senior Brothers are right, we'll leave now!"</p><p></p><p>"Senior Brother, my grandfather is an Elder of a Second-Grade Sect, I don't know if I have the qualifications to be your friend? In the future, we can visit each other more?"</p><p></p><p>"Tch, a Second-Grade Sect also dares to come out and make a fool of themselves? My father is the Sect Master of the Xuanhuo Sect, L√º Ye! Do you have what it takes to match me? Senior Brother, come, let's become sworn brothers!"</p><p></p><p>"Hiss..."</p><p></p><p>Not only the crowd, even Cai Xu and Huang Bin were shocked!</p><p></p><p>The Junior Sect Master of the Xuanhuo Sect has come to participate in the Xiao Yao Sect's assessment, what does this mean???</p><p></p><p>Everyone looked at this young cultivator in amazement, no one doubted it, who would dare to impersonate the Junior Sect Master of the Xuanhuo Sect!</p><p></p><p>Cai Xu and Huang Bin looked at each other.</p><p></p><p>The Junior Sect Master of the Xuanhuo Sect wants to become their sworn brothers? In the past, they wouldn't even dare to imagine such a thing!</p><p></p><p>But fortunately, after becoming Xiao Yao Sect disciples, they had also seen a lot of the world.</p><p></p><p>And since their own Sect Master was invincible, they weren't too nervous.</p><p></p><p>They just felt a sense of wonder, twelve and a half years ago, they really had caught the big break.</p><p></p><p>To be a lowly disciple of the Xiao Yao Sect, it's truly wonderful.</p><p></p><p>Even the Junior Sect Master of a First-Grade Sect is rushing to become their sworn brothers.</p>

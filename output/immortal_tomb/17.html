        <h1>Chapter 17</h1>
        <div class="content">
            <p>Here is the full English translation of the Chinese excerpt:</p><p></p><p>Just in a moment. üê≤üíû‚ûÖ‚ùæ—ï·ïºùìä–ñ.‚í∏ùìû‚ìÇüêô‡∂è</p><p></p><p>Gu Helin and Tongxin suddenly remembered!</p><p></p><p>The young man in blue robes in front of them was none other than the cultivator they had encountered at the immortal tomb that night.</p><p></p><p>What was this person doing in Moyu Town? Gu Helin recalled the terrifying power from before, and his face grew tense as he looked at Lu Changsheng, trying to keep his tone steady as he asked, "D-Daoist friend, just now in the sky, and then... and then..."</p><p></p><p>"Yes, it was me," Lu Changsheng replied calmly.</p><p></p><p>Shhh!!</p><p></p><p>Gu Helin and Tongxin immediately sucked in a breath, their eyes trembling.</p><p></p><p>The next moment, Gu Helin pulled Tongxin and came before Lu Changsheng, bowing down.</p><p></p><p>"Senior, Helin dares to ask, what matter do you seek us for?" </p><p></p><p>At this moment, Gu Helin's mind was in a daze, thinking about Lu Changsheng's appearance, his brain racking its thoughts. </p><p></p><p>He had never heard of this before, at least not in the Eastern Domain, when had such a powerful cultivator appeared in the immortal cultivation world?</p><p></p><p>Could he be a reclusive ancient monster?</p><p></p><p>"Sit, have a drink," Lu Changsheng said softly.</p><p></p><p>"Yes, this is Helin's honor," Gu Helin dared not refuse, as his and Tongxin's lives were now in the other's hands.</p><p></p><p>Tongxin stood respectfully to the side, head bowed in silence, his heart bitterly resentful.</p><p></p><p>Just a random passerby, yet they had the misfortune to encounter a cultivator so powerful that even the sect master had difficulty resisting...</p><p></p><p>Apart from the sect master, Tongxin had never seen his teacher treat anyone with such reverence, and this young man in blue robes was the second.</p><p></p><p>"Senior, let me pour for you," Gu Helin said calmly as he picked up the wine jug, though his slightly trembling hand betrayed his inner turmoil.</p><p></p><p>Lu Changsheng looked at his trembling hand and smiled, "Don't be afraid, I won't harm you."</p><p></p><p>But this seemingly gentle smile only sent a chill down Gu Helin's spine.</p><p></p><p>"That night, I did not intend to cross paths with you, but since we have met again today, it seems we have some karmic connection," Lu Changsheng said as he took a sip of wine.</p><p></p><p>Gu Helin forced a laugh, "Senior's words are absolutely right, absolutely right."</p><p></p><p>Beside him, Tongxin couldn't help but smile wryly. He had never seen his teacher act this way, not even when facing the sect master.</p><p></p><p>This almost seemed like fawning.</p><p></p><p>Lu Changsheng nodded, then said thoughtfully, "I have some questions for you, I hope you can tell me."</p><p></p><p>Gu Helin hurriedly waved his hand, "Senior, you honor Helin too much. Please ask whatever you wish, Helin will speak without holding back!"</p><p></p><p>Lu Changsheng tapped his fingers rhythmically on the table, his expression blank as he said, "Tell me about this Immortal Dust Realm and the immortal tomb."</p><p></p><p>At these words, Tongxin's body trembled, and Gu Helin's expression also changed, his eyes filled with doubt. But realizing the person before him might be a reclusive ancient monster, he no longer bothered to think about the details or logic.</p><p></p><p>He quickly said, "Senior, let me tell you about it!"</p><p></p><p>Thereafter, Lu Changsheng listened attentively as Gu Helin recounted, occasionally nodding lightly.</p><p></p><p>Meanwhile,</p><p></p><p>Outside the governor's mansion.</p><p></p><p>King Lieshui sat on a chair, with officials and guards standing on both sides.</p><p></p><p>Since the governor's mansion could not accommodate so many people, everyone gathered outside in the scorching sun to discuss matters.</p><p></p><p>Of course, someone was holding a parasol to shade the King of Lieshui.</p><p></p><p>"How is the deployment outside Moyu Town progressing?" the King of Lieshui asked casually.</p><p></p><p>Here is the full English translation of the Chinese excerpt:</p><p></p><p>"Your Majesty, the encampment outside the city is progressing vigorously at the moment. The experienced troops have been stationed, and with their assistance, the villagers' encampment work should be completed by nightfall," the middle-aged official stood up and reported respectfully.</p><p></p><p>"Excellent. In addition, we must also dig latrines and the like for the villagers. Tonight, let the villagers first consume their own provisions, and tomorrow the army's cooks will prepare a large pot of rice for them!" </p><p></p><p>The King of Lishui continued, "The surrounding vigilance must also be constantly maintained!"</p><p></p><p>"Your Majesty is wise," the middle-aged official bowed deeply and exclaimed.</p><p></p><p>The other officials also hurriedly bowed.</p><p></p><p>"Alright, you may go now and oversee it personally," the King of Lishui waved his hand towards the middle-aged official.</p><p></p><p>"Your Majesty, I will take my leave," the official said and departed.</p><p></p><p>After the middle-aged official left, the King of Lishui turned his gaze to the slightly reserved Chen Dadao standing aside, and said amiably, "I have never been to this Moyu Town before, but this time I am quite surprised to find its scenery so pleasant, and it is so well-organized under your management!"</p><p></p><p>Chen Dadao hurriedly stepped out from among the officials, knelt on the ground respectfully, and said, "Thank you, Your Majesty, for the praise. I am unworthy of such high regard."</p><p></p><p>The King of Lishui's eyes flashed with appreciation as he smiled and said, "What is your name? How many years have you been serving in Moyu Town?"</p><p></p><p>Chen Dadao respectfully replied, "I am surnamed Chen, with the given name Dadao. I have been serving in Moyu Town for more than five years."</p><p></p><p>At this moment, Chen Dadao was still a bit nervous, as he had never seen the supreme authority of the Lishui Empire before. However, since he had already interacted with the Immortal Master, facing this worldly emperor was not as daunting as it would have been in the past.</p><p></p><p>The King of Lishui looked at the unassuming Chen Dadao and said with appreciation, "As a town magistrate, you are not servile in front of me. I have always been excellent at judging people, and you are quite remarkable. You are worthy of being entrusted with greater responsibilities."</p><p></p><p>Chen Dadao was at a loss for words, as he had never interacted with a king before. He could only respond awkwardly, "Your Majesty is too kind, I am unworthy."</p><p></p><p>"Haha," the King of Lishui chuckled and probed, "This time, the eastern part of the empire has been plagued by demonic disturbances, and all the towns have suffered severe losses, except for your Moyu Town, which has only had sixty-seven casualties."</p><p></p><p>Chen Dadao's heart skipped a beat, and he respectfully said, "Your Majesty, I do not know the reason either, but I have speculated that it may be related to Moyu Town's proximity to the legendary Immortal Tomb, compared to other towns."</p><p></p><p>This was the wording that Chen Dadao had previously discussed with the Steward. They could only come up with this reasonable explanation, as they knew the Immortal Master would not want to have too much contact with the king and these officials.</p><p></p><p>"Good! I'm impressed that your mind is so sharp! You've actually come to the same conclusion as I have!" </p><p></p><p>At this moment, Dong Ge suddenly stepped out, looking excited as he stared at Chen Dadao.</p><p></p><p>He felt like he had found a kindred spirit!</p><p></p><p>"Ahem," the King of Lishui glanced at him briefly and cleared his throat.</p><p></p><p>Dong Ge's body trembled, and he remembered the current situation. He quickly bowed and said, "Your Majesty, I have overstepped my bounds in my excitement."</p><p></p><p>The King of Lishui waved his hand, dismissing him, and did not blame him too much, as the old man had indeed played a role earlier.</p><p></p><p>As for Chen Dadao, he finally understood why the King of Lishui had brought the villagers to encamp around Moyu Town. It turned out that he had the same idea as the explanation he and the Steward had fabricated!</p><p></p><p>This was good, very good...</p>

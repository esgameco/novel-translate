        <h1>Chapter 216</h1>
        <div class="content">
            <p>Here is the full English translation of the Chinese excerpt:</p><p></p><p>At the same time, ‚ô®üê∫‚ùª‚ûàÀ¢‚Ñçùï¶ùïè.·ëï·ªñ·µêüç¨üíã</p><p></p><p>In the Yuxian Tavern of Jinglei City,</p><p></p><p>Lu Changsheng pushed open the door and leisurely walked down the stairs.</p><p></p><p>Today, the Yuxian Tavern was very empty. Not only were there no customers, but even the shopkeeper and the waiter were nowhere to be seen, having gone early to the Sunset Thunder Forest to watch the battle.</p><p></p><p>After leaving the tavern, the usually bustling Jinglei City today did not have a single soul to be seen.</p><p></p><p>The shops and stalls along the street were actually left unattended...</p><p></p><p>It was as if the entire city had only Lu Changsheng left.</p><p></p><p>Lu Changsheng followed the fragrance to a pastry stall, picked up two oil-paper wrapped pastries, left a colorful spirit stone on the stall, and then started walking towards the Sunset Thunder Forest while eating the pastries.</p><p></p><p>As he walked, he soon disappeared from sight.</p><p></p><p>...</p><p></p><p>In the Sunset Thunder Forest, it was deathly silent.</p><p></p><p>The arrogance and overbearingness of the Xiaoyao Sect had completely stunned the cultivators!</p><p></p><p>Who had ever seen a sect dare to have such an attitude towards the Great Day Thunder Sect? This was simply rushing headlong towards the path to the underworld!</p><p></p><p>In the Xiaoyao Sect camp,</p><p></p><p>The disciples' eyes were burning with fervor and their blood boiling!</p><p></p><p>But the newly promoted disciples like Cai Xu and Huang Bin had somewhat pale faces, with a mix of excitement and bewilderment, their palms sweating profusely.</p><p></p><p>To say they were not nervous would be a lie. Gazing at their arrogant elders, looking at the Great Day Thunder Sect that was once unreachable to them, and feeling the countless gazes upon them, they were more filled with excitement and unparalleled pride, their heartbeats racing faster and faster!</p><p></p><p>To step onto such a grand stage watched by the world, to be honest, even if they died, this life would have been worth it!</p><p></p><p>At this moment, the jade token representing the first place in the Nine Realms Sect Competition appeared in Peng Fang's hand, and he infused it with a Immortal Qi, while shouting in a low voice,</p><p></p><p>"Begin the battle immediately!"</p><p></p><p>Boom!!</p><p></p><p>The jade token shattered in his palm!!</p><p></p><p>Above the cultivators, a massive elderly phantom slowly appeared in the sky, its expression indifferent, speaking calmly,</p><p></p><p>"The Nine Realms Sect Xiaoyao Sect has applied for an immediate battle. Is the Great Day Thunder Sect prepared?"</p><p></p><p>The moment the elderly phantom appeared, Lu Ye and Li Tailing's eyes narrowed, and they hurriedly stood up from their seats, not daring to be negligent.</p><p></p><p>Because this phantom's master... was the Patriarch of the Holy Deity Temple!!</p><p></p><p>The Holy Deity Temple, the undisputed hegemon sect in the Linglong Heavens!!</p><p></p><p>In the Linglong Heavens, it was an existence revered by all sects!!</p><p></p><p>Except for the Xiaoyao Sect members, everyone else was bowing respectfully!</p><p></p><p>For a Nine Realms Sect to challenge a First Realm Sect, the treatment was indeed extremely high, to the point of being presided over by the Patriarch of the Holy Deity Temple himself! Although it was just a phantom, it was enough!</p><p></p><p>Zhong Wuyan's eyes sharpened, and he respectfully replied, "Reporting to the Patriarch, the Great Day Thunder Sect is prepared!"</p><p></p><p>The expression of the elderly phantom seemed unchanging since ancient times, he simply spoke indifferently, "Good, the battle across realms shall begin immediately, the rules are simple, no need to waste time."</p><p></p><p>"Your two sects, the sect masters and elders shall battle, the executives and protectors shall battle, and the disciples shall battle..."</p><p></p><p>"The battle mode - free-for-all."</p><p></p><p>"Three battlefields, winning two is victory."</p><p></p><p>"If the Xiaoyao Sect wins, they will replace the Great Day Thunder Sect. If the Great Day Thunder Sect wins, the Xiaoyao Sect will be destroyed."</p><p></p><p>As the words fell, the elderly phantom raised his hand slightly, and three massive purple-gold transparent spaces appeared in the sky above the Sunset Thunder Forest, emanating an unbreakable aura, separated from each other but able to clearly see the scenes within.</p><p></p><p>"The two sects shall quickly enter the battlefields, once the battle begins, no one will be able to interfere," the elderly phantom said coldly.</p><p></p><p>The implication was that once the battle started, this fight would be untouchable by anyone!</p><p></p><p>Peng Fang suddenly turned around, his gaze sweeping across the executives, protectors, and all the disciples.</p><p></p><p>At this moment, every face was filled with determination!</p><p></p><p>Peng Fang smiled slightly and said softly, "Executives, protectors, and disciples..."</p><p></p><p>"Great Elder," the crowd immediately bowed.</p><p></p><p>Here is the full English translation of the Chinese excerpt:</p><p></p><p>"You all must remember... Our Xiaoyao Sect does not covet those two victories, but rather... three consecutive victories!!"</p><p></p><p>The new 69 book bar 99 shuanx.com</p><p></p><p>"We will let the world know that although our Xiaoyao Sect is newly established, none of the levels within our sect are inferior to the top-tier sects!"</p><p></p><p>"Understand?"</p><p></p><p>Peng Fang narrowed his eyes and said indifferently.</p><p></p><p>"Understood." The crowd took a light breath and responded.</p><p></p><p>Peng Fang smiled in satisfaction, turning to look at the purple-golden space that was like a prison of heaven and earth, his gaze solemn.</p><p></p><p>He had a feeling that this purple-golden space would be difficult for him to shake even slightly.</p><p></p><p>He then shouted: "Xiaoyao Sect, hear the order, enter the battlefield!"</p><p></p><p>In the next moment, he flashed into the first purple-golden space, along with the four people including Left Chou Shan!</p><p></p><p>Zhu Xingqiu and the other executive protectors looked expectantly at Tong Xin and Lin Dong and the other disciples, and they also entered the second purple-golden space!</p><p></p><p>Tong Xin and Lin Dong exchanged a glance, without further words, and quickly led the disciples into the third purple-golden space, "Let's go!"</p><p></p><p>Zhong Wuyan coldly looked at the people of the Xiaoyao Sect entering the purple-golden space and sneered, "Hehe, the Great Sun Thunder Sect, hear the order, follow the Elder into the battlefield!"</p><p></p><p>"Yes!"</p><p></p><p>In an instant, they surged towards the three purple-golden spaces!</p><p></p><p>Watching this scene, the cultivators' faces flushed red, excitedly unable to control themselves, the long-awaited great battle was about to begin!!</p><p></p><p>"Have the people of the two sects all entered? If so, the purple-golden space will be closed." The vast, elderly virtual figure in the sky asked.</p><p></p><p>At this moment, Lei Chengdong appeared in the sky above the Sunset Thunder Forest, and he looked at the virtual figure of the elder, slightly bowed, and sighed with a smile, "Patriarch Wei, I didn't expect it to be you personally presiding over this. Our sect is unworthy..."</p><p></p><p>The Sect Master of the Great Sun Thunder Sect, Lei Chengdong!!</p><p></p><p>The cultivators' heartbeats quickened again, their gazes filled with reverence.</p><p></p><p>The virtual figure of the elder's gaze flashed as he looked down at Lei Chengdong and said, "Sect Master Lei, are you not entering the purple-golden space? If not, you won't be able to enter later."</p><p></p><p>Lei Chengdong suddenly swept his gaze around, his line of sight passing through the three purple-golden spaces and the countless cultivators in the sky. He shook his head and smiled, "Since the Sect Master of the Xiaoyao Sect has not entered this purple-golden space, our sect naturally will not enter either. Could it be that we are bullying the weak?"</p><p></p><p>The Sect Master of the Xiaoyao Sect!</p><p></p><p>This title once again caused a tremor in the hearts of countless cultivators!</p><p></p><p>Yes, even up to the scene of the cross-level battle, they had never seen the mysterious Sect Master of the Xiaoyao Sect!!</p><p></p><p>"Good, Sect Master Lei has quite a bearing and demeanor." The virtual figure of the elder nodded slightly, and then gently waved his hand.</p><p></p><p>Hum hum hum!!</p><p></p><p>Instantly, the purple-golden space was filled with flowing light, and countless barriers connected one after another,</p><p></p><p>Accompanied by a thunderous sound, the purple-golden space was completely closed!!</p><p></p><p>Seeing this, Lei Chengdong's eyes flashed, and he swept his gaze around again, but found nothing, then headed towards where L√º Ye and the others were. A senior quickly prepared a chair, and L√º Ye and Li Tailin slightly moved aside to make space for the chair. Soon, Lei Chengdong smiled at the two of them and then sat down in the middle position.</p><p></p><p>At the same time,</p><p></p><p>Lu Changsheng was quietly standing in the sea of people, eating a pastry, and looking at the virtual figure of the elder in the sky, and then his gaze casually swept over Lei Chengdong and Li Tailin.</p><p></p><p>"Senior? Senior??"</p><p></p><p>Suddenly, someone next to him exclaimed in surprise.</p><p></p><p>Lu Changsheng retracted his gaze, turned his head to look, and was slightly surprised to see the person who had given him a seat at the Xianyan Pavilion the other day.</p><p></p><p>Zhao An was now looking at the young man in green robes with reverence. She didn't expect to coincidentally meet him here!</p><p></p><p>The impression this senior had left on her was too deep, mainly because he was simply too extravagant!!</p><p></p><p>Zhao An looked at the young man in green robes who was eating the pastry with relish, and respectfully smiled, "Senior, what a coincidence, I didn't expect to meet you here."</p><p></p><p>After all, at this moment in the Sunset Thunder Forest, cultivators were as numerous as the stars, to be able to encounter him was truly a coincidence!</p><p></p><p>"It's alright." Lu Changsheng smiled and said a sentence, then turned his attention back to the purple-golden space.</p><p></p><p>The pastry in his hand, bite by bite, visibly disappeared.</p><p></p><p>Zhao An snapped out of her amazement and quickly averted her gaze, not daring to disturb him further, only slightly distancing herself from Lu Changsheng.</p><p></p><p>This senior in green robes, although he was gentle, gave her a very special and mysterious feeling.</p><p></p><p>It's better to keep a distance.</p><p></p><p>At this moment, the voice of the elder virtual figure in the sky suddenly resounded, instantly igniting the blood of everyone present,</p><p></p><p>"The cross-level battle, begin!"</p>

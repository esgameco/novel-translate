        <h1>Chapter 199</h1>
        <div class="content">
            <p>Here is the full English translation of the Chinese novel excerpt:</p><p></p><p>"Yes!" </p><p></p><p>Peng Fang respectfully acknowledged, then turned and looked at the excited faces, waving his hand and saying, "Let's depart. üêºüíöÔºñ‚ûà·îïùêáùï¶ùìß.ùïîœÉùêåüç´üò≤"</p><p></p><p>The spiritual boat suddenly began to vibrate, and the next moment, it had transformed into a stream of light, rushing towards the horizon.</p><p></p><p>Xiaoyao Sect, the rear mountain.</p><p></p><p>Until the stream of light disappeared on the horizon, Lu Changsheng finally withdrew his gaze.</p><p></p><p>A flash of blue light flickered in his pupils, and then an ancient and simple long sword appeared suspended before him, becoming much larger than before.</p><p></p><p>Lu Changsheng stepped onto the long sword, lifted his robe, and sat down. Then he took a sip from the gourd at his waist and smiled, "Let's go."</p><p></p><p>The long sword seemed to have a spirit, trembling slightly to indicate its response, and then with a whoosh, it carried the green figure and disappeared into the rear mountain.</p><p></p><p>As the sect master, he naturally had to go and take a look at the Grand Competition of the Myriad Sects, after all, the other sect masters were all leading their sects to battle.</p><p></p><p>Of course, he was just too idle.</p><p></p><p>There was a reason why he did not choose to go with Peng Fang and the others. Lu Changsheng knew that if he were present, the elders and disciples would be more restrained.</p><p></p><p>Even if they did anything, they would have to consult his opinion, which would be a bit troublesome.</p><p></p><p>...</p><p></p><p>In the Human Realm, there were three first-grade sects standing at the peak.</p><p></p><p>They were the Great Sun Thunder Sect, the Mysterious Fire Sect, and the Heavenly Sword Pavilion!</p><p></p><p>The Great Sun Thunder Sect was located in the Thunder Continent, and the entire sect was extremely vast, occupying one-tenth of the area of the Thunder Continent!</p><p></p><p>At this moment, in a magnificent building where electric arcs were flashing, a handsome young man bowed to the figure sitting cross-legged with his back turned to them.</p><p></p><p>"Father, since the ranking battle between the first-grade sects has not yet begun, my sister and I would like to go to the Extreme Cold Ice Field to play and take a look at the competition of the nine-grade sects."</p><p></p><p>By the young man's side, a young lady was also standing with a bow.</p><p></p><p>Lei Chengdong, with his back to the two, raised his head to look at the statue of the Thunder Ancestor and said with a faint smile, "Hehe, you two restless little ones... Well, since you have made some progress in your cultivation during this time, then go out and have a good time."</p><p></p><p>Hearing this, Lei Yu and Lei Ting exchanged a quick glance, both seeing the joy in each other's eyes. They had actually just come to test the waters, and they didn't expect their father to agree!</p><p></p><p>"But don't be too happy yet, you can go, but I will send two guardians to accompany you," Lei Chengdong said as the cushion beneath him rotated, and he looked at the two.</p><p></p><p>Lei Yu and Lei Ting's expressions immediately fell. They didn't want to be monitored!</p><p></p><p>"Father, do we really need the guardians? The Extreme Cold Ice Field is mostly low-grade sects, and with my and my sister's strength, we can handle it. Plus, with our identities, who would dare..." Lei Yu said in a low voice.</p><p></p><p>"Hmm?" Lei Chengdong stared at him, his eyes flashing like lightning.</p><p></p><p>Lei Yu immediately fell silent, not daring to speak further.</p><p></p><p>"Either with the guardians or you don't go at all," Lei Chengdong said indifferently.</p><p></p><p>"We'll go, we'll go, Father," Lei Yu and Lei Ting hurriedly nodded.</p><p></p><p>Having the guardians accompany them was better than not being able to go at all.</p><p></p><p>Lei Chengdong nodded slightly, then looked at Lei Ting with a loving gaze and said with a smile, "Alright, you two can go now. I have already summoned Zhao the Guardian and Lin the Guardian, they are waiting for you outside."</p><p></p><p>"Yes, Father."</p><p></p><p>Lei Yu and Lei Ting bowed and then retreated.</p><p></p><p>Lei Chengdong shook his head helplessly, and the cushion rotated back. He calmed his mind and focused his attention on the statue of the Thunder Ancestor, his eyes unblinking as lightning flickered in his pupils, as if he was cultivating or comprehending something.</p><p></p><p>Here is the full English translation of the Chinese excerpt:</p><p></p><p>At the same time, when Leiyu and Leitong arrived outside the palace, they immediately saw an old man and an old woman waiting there.</p><p></p><p>"Young Sect Master (Holy Maiden)," Zhao Hufa and Lin Hufa said, bowing.</p><p></p><p>Leiyu discreetly pursed his lips and said indifferently, "Let's go."</p><p></p><p>...</p><p></p><p>The Extreme Cold Ice Field is located in the northernmost part of the human domain, boundless and as far as the eye can see, everything is a pure white.</p><p></p><p>It has a rather remarkable reputation throughout the entire human domain.</p><p></p><p>The reason is simple - it is the venue for the Nine Rank Sect Competition held every year, and the climate of this place is extremely special.</p><p></p><p>As is well known, cultivators are relatively immune to ordinary cold, and even if the temperature drops to an unbearable level, they can activate their immortal qi to resist it.</p><p></p><p>But it's different in the Extreme Cold Ice Field!</p><p></p><p>The cold there is extreme, penetrating to the bone. Even if the cultivators activate their immortal qi to form a cold-resistant barrier, they still find it difficult to withstand that kind of cold.</p><p></p><p>That strange cold is like a sharp knife, easily able to split open the immortal qi and invade the flesh, freezing the internal organs.</p><p></p><p>For those without cultivation, coming here would instantly turn them into ice popsicles, with no chance of survival.</p><p></p><p>And for the cultivators here, although they won't be that dramatic, they will still be in great discomfort! </p><p></p><p>They have to constantly circulate their immortal qi along with the warm blood throughout their bodies to alleviate the cold, otherwise they too will face the danger of freezing.</p><p></p><p>Therefore, in the Extreme Cold Ice Field, immortal qi is extremely precious, with replenishment far slower than consumption!</p><p></p><p>One must conserve it as much as possible!</p><p></p><p>At this time, many spiritual boats have already arrived at the edge of the Extreme Cold Ice Field, all belonging to the Nine Rank Sects participating in this great competition.</p><p></p><p>They are about to face the cruel preliminary screening before the competition - trekking through the Extreme Cold Ice Field to reach the central competition site!</p><p></p><p>The time limit is two and a half months!</p><p></p><p>When the sound of the celestial bell rings, the timing will begin!</p><p></p><p>Two and a half months later, the sects that fail to reach the center of the Extreme Cold Ice Field will be directly disqualified from the competition!</p><p></p><p>In these two and a half months, whether it is the extreme cold weather, the ferocious beasts within, or the infighting and scheming between the sects, they will all cause the downfall of many sects and the death of countless cultivators!</p><p></p><p>Just this first round will eliminate a large number of the Nine Rank Sects!</p><p></p><p>At this moment, more and more sects are arriving at the edge of the Extreme Cold Ice Field, their numbers varying.</p><p></p><p>Most sects pursue quality, with a total sect population of around tens of thousands.</p><p></p><p>But some sects pursue quantity, with their total sect population even reaching tens of millions, or even over a hundred million!</p><p></p><p>With large numbers, even if nothing else is said, at least the momentum looks impressive, densely packed together.</p><p></p><p>Fortunately, the Extreme Cold Ice Field is immensely vast, so even though the sect numbers are high, they still look like grains of sand.</p><p></p><p>Time flows, and more and more sects arrive at this place, to the point that it is almost impossible to count how many Nine Rank Sects there are, with thousands visible at a glance.</p><p></p><p>But this is far from the limit of the human domain!</p><p></p><p>In the human domain, there are definitely tens of thousands of Nine Rank Sects, and after excluding the small number that have voluntarily withdrawn, at least half of them will come to participate in the Grand Competition of the Myriad Sects!</p><p></p><p>After all, setting aside the fame and the generous rewards of the First Rank Sects, the Grand Competition of the Myriad Sects is an excellent opportunity for tempering!</p><p></p><p>The Blood Flame Pavilion, the Forestorm Sect, and the Neon Pavilion have also arrived among the vast throng of sects, but the three of them are currently extremely solemn.</p><p></p><p>In the region south of the Canglan Continent, they may be the overlord sects, but here... the Nine Rank Sects that are stronger than them are countless!</p><p></p><p>They cannot help but be cautious!</p>

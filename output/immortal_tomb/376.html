        <h1>Chapter 376</h1>
        <div class="content">
            <p>Here is the full English translation of the excerpt from the Chinese novel:</p><p></p><p>The young boy stared at Lu Changsheng, and in those bloodthirsty eyes, there was a hint of struggle and hesitation.</p><p></p><p>This man in blue robes could easily break the sealing chains that bound him, so his strength must be extremely powerful.</p><p></p><p>The other party certainly wouldn't have released him for no reason, but did he really have to obey orders?</p><p></p><p>As the Calamitous Demonic Child, how could he submit to others!</p><p></p><p>The Demonic Child hesitated for a moment, then said, "You helped me escape today, and if I have the chance in the future, I will definitely repay you. Don't worry."</p><p></p><p>Lu Changsheng asked, "Are you leaving?"</p><p></p><p>The Demonic Child nodded and turned to leave.</p><p></p><p>Lu Changsheng's expression was blank, and a blue light flashed in his dark eyes.</p><p></p><p>And the Demonic Child, he was frozen in place!</p><p></p><p>The Demonic Child's expression at this moment was extremely terrified. He didn't know what had happened, but he couldn't move at all!</p><p></p><p>This was even more extreme than being confined by the chains before. Except for his slightly opening mouth and trembling eyes, he couldn't move anything else...</p><p></p><p>In just a moment, he knew it was the man in blue's doing.</p><p></p><p>This man in blue was even more terrifying than he had thought!</p><p></p><p>The Demonic Child had previously thought that even though his cultivation had weakened after being imprisoned for many years, it wouldn't be easy for this man in blue to do anything to him. But now...</p><p></p><p>"What... what are you going to do?" The Demonic Child's tone finally revealed his fear.</p><p></p><p>Lu Changsheng looked at the small figure of the Demonic Child and said faintly, "I feel like the torment you've suffered is still not enough..."</p><p></p><p>Hearing the voice from behind him, the Demonic Child suddenly felt panicked.</p><p></p><p>"Big... Big Brother, it was my mistake just now..."</p><p></p><p>Lu Changsheng gave a cold laugh. "What a weathervane of a thing..."</p><p></p><p>The Demonic Child was about to say some flattering words, but suddenly a loud sound exploded in his mind!</p><p></p><p>Boom... Boom... Boom...!</p><p></p><p>His face immediately turned deathly pale, and his gaze became incredibly horrifying!</p><p></p><p>Crack!</p><p></p><p>His teeth clenched together with such force that they all shattered in that moment!</p><p></p><p>Boom... Boom... Boom!</p><p></p><p>The intermittent sounds echoed in the Demonic Child's mind, like the ringing of bells, the sound of wooden fish, the sound of all things in the world. Each sound made his soul tremble uncontrollably.</p><p></p><p>It was as if trying to forcibly wash away his demonic qi, irresistible and unstoppable.</p><p></p><p>Suddenly, the sounds in the Demonic Child's mind disappeared.</p><p></p><p>His whole body suddenly relaxed, utterly exhausted. If Lu Changsheng hadn't held him in place, he would have collapsed and become a dead dog.</p><p></p><p>"Do you know what that sound was?" Lu Changsheng asked softly.</p><p></p><p>The Demonic Child, now barely clinging to life, with blood at the corners of his mouth, replied in a slurred voice, "What... what sound?"</p><p></p><p>"I call it the sound of the Tao," Lu Changsheng said calmly.</p><p></p><p>The Tao... the sound of the Tao? First the Tao Demon Suppressing Tower, and now the sound of the Tao...</p><p></p><p>The Demonic Child sniffed, not knowing why, but suddenly felt like crying.</p><p></p><p>He had fallen into that person's hands long ago, and now he had fallen into the hands of a man in blue robes. It was a seamless transition.</p><p></p><p>He was too bitter.</p><p></p><p>He wanted to speak, but he really had no strength left. It seemed he had been suppressed for too long, and his consumption was too great, no longer as powerful as before.</p><p></p><p>"From now on, you will stay here. The sound of the Tao will resound in your mind once every half day. Enjoy it."</p><p></p><p>Lu Changsheng smiled gently and slowly disappeared from behind the Demonic Child.</p><p></p><p>Half a day... resounding once!</p><p></p><p>The Demonic Child was frightened, his heart pounding wildly, and finally, the tears gushed out, and he couldn't help but cry.</p><p></p><p>Here is the full English translation of the Chinese excerpt:</p><p></p><p>Suddenly, he missed the days when he was suppressed by the chains, although it was lonely and agonizing, but it was still better than this soul-crushing Great Dao sound.</p><p></p><p>...</p><p></p><p>Outside the Great Dao Demon Suppressing Tower, a figure in blue robes slowly emerged.</p><p></p><p>Lu Changsheng turned around and looked at the seven-story tall tower connecting heaven and earth, pondering slightly, and then decided to take it.</p><p></p><p>Apart from the fact that this tower was indeed quite good, there was also the demon child still inside.</p><p></p><p>That devilish thing, if it could be reformed, would not be a bad henchman.</p><p></p><p>The old turtle is still a bit lacking at the moment, who knows if he is really determined to work hard or just fishing for three days and drying the net for two days.</p><p></p><p>After a moment of contemplation, Lu Changsheng stretched out his right hand towards the Great Dao Demon Suppressing Tower, and then suddenly clenched it!</p><p></p><p>Rumble!</p><p></p><p>The Great Dao Demon Suppressing Tower suddenly shook and then quickly shrank in size.</p><p></p><p>In no time, the towering giant tower had transformed into a miniature tower, which then swooped over and hovered obediently in the palm of Lu Changsheng's hand, slowly rotating.</p><p></p><p>After examining the colorful lights on it for a while, Lu Changsheng flipped his hand and stored the Great Dao Demon Suppressing Tower away.</p><p></p><p>He then looked towards the southeast direction of the Divine-Demonic Battlefield and took a step forward, disappearing into the fog of war.</p><p></p><p>And this place became empty, the ancient and towering "Seven-Colored Glazed Tower" was no longer there.</p><p></p><p>...</p><p></p><p>In the human domain.</p><p></p><p>Almost all cultivators were gathering towards the Heaven, Earth, and Human Three Cities, following Jian Wuwei's order, fully preparing for battle.</p><p></p><p>At the same time, outside the human domain, various races had begun to arrive one after another.</p><p></p><p>The first to arrive were dozens of races that had grievances against the human race, such as the Ghostly Snake Tribe.</p><p></p><p>They stopped their steps outside the human domain, waiting for the arrival of other foreign races.</p><p></p><p>When the human patrol scouts discovered this scene, they felt a tightness in their hearts and immediately reported it to their superiors.</p><p></p><p>The five masters in the Heaven, Earth, and Human Three Cities received the news without much surprise.</p><p></p><p>This was just the beginning, after all, the scene of all races converging had already been imagined countless times in their minds.</p><p></p><p>The only thing they could do now was to wait, wait for the moment when all the races had gathered.</p><p></p><p>As time passed, more and more foreign races arrived outside the human domain.</p><p></p><p>Countless gazes with strange lights seemed to want to penetrate the fog of war and enter the human domain.</p><p></p><p>And at this time, the human domain was unusually quiet, no one dared to speak loudly.</p><p></p><p>Everyone could feel the chilling killing intent in the fog of war, as well as the terrifying oppressive force targeting the human race!</p><p></p><p>If the fog of war could be dispersed at this moment, everyone would be able to see the dark, looming figures!</p><p></p><p>Compared to the time of the Seven-Colored Glazed Tower, it was even more overwhelming!</p><p></p><p>After all, except for the top ten peak great clans and the top hundred great clans, almost all other races had arrived in full force!</p><p></p><p>This place was no longer like the Seven-Colored Glazed Tower, since there was no limit on the number of people, they naturally had to deploy more troops.</p><p></p><p>The Glazed Heart was very important to them, and they could not afford to be careless.</p><p></p><p>Soon, the top hundred great clans arrived one after another, and the atmosphere of austerity soared to the heavens!</p><p></p><p>When a sacred light flashed and the majestic roars of dragons, phoenixes, tigers, and the Black Tortoise echoed, the ten peak great clans had finally arrived!</p><p></p><p>At this point, except for a few small tribes like the Fly Tribe, almost all the races had gathered!</p><p></p><p>At this moment, within the fog of war, there were only the figures of the foreign races.</p><p></p><p>At the same time, in the Heaven City, Jian Wuwei suddenly opened his eyes, a fierce aura appearing around him, and he roared:</p><p></p><p>"Those at the Divine Profound level and above, follow me out of the human domain!"</p>

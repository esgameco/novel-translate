        <h1>Chapter 238</h1>
        <div class="content">
            <p>Here is the full English translation of the Chinese excerpt:</p><p></p><p>The Divine Celestial Realm, the Crimson Heavenly Domain. üêâüê∏‚ûÖ‚ùæ‚ìà‚ìó·ªÆ‰πÇ.ƒÜùêéùïûüêºüíô</p><p></p><p>The Divine King's Palace.</p><p></p><p>An old man with a sword at his waist bowed and stood outside the administrative hall, calling out, </p><p></p><p>"Divine King, Lin Chuan requests an audience!"</p><p></p><p>"Enter."</p><p></p><p>Hearing this, the old man straightened up and quickly walked in.</p><p></p><p>As soon as Lin Chuan entered, he saw a young man in golden robes, of utmost elegance, sitting at the head and seemingly reviewing something.</p><p></p><p>Lin Chuan slightly furrowed his brow, bowed respectfully, and waited in silence.</p><p></p><p>After a moment, Ye Wutian put down his brush and looked up, smiling kindly at Lin Chuan. "Sword Wielder Lin, no need for such formalities, please have a seat."</p><p></p><p>"Thank you, Divine King." Lin Chuan let out a light sigh, straightened up, and took a seat to the side.</p><p></p><p>Seeing him seated, Ye Wutian asked with a smile, "Sword Wielder Lin, what brings you to seek an audience with the King?"</p><p></p><p>Lin Chuan's brow furrowed slightly as he sighed, "Divine King, the Divine Emperor's Palace has just sent another message, inquiring why several Immortal Emperors of the Five Major Immortal Realms have not yet ascended."</p><p></p><p>Hearing this, Ye Wutian's brow raised, and he slowly stood up, asking suspiciously, "Why has the Divine Emperor's Palace suddenly started paying attention to the affairs of the Four Immortal Realms?"</p><p></p><p>He had thought that one inquiry would have been enough, but he did not expect the Divine Emperor's Palace to send another message!</p><p></p><p>Just like in previous generations, when the Immortal Emperors of the Four Realms ascended, the Divine Emperor's Palace would meet with them once, and then, disappointed, simply assign them some ordinary duties, basically not caring much afterwards, because although those Immortal Emperors' talents surpassed the native Immortal Emperors of the Ancestral Celestial Realm, they were still far from reaching the level worthy of the Divine Emperor's Palace's attention.</p><p></p><p>In the Ancestral Celestial Realm, Immortal Emperor realm cultivators were not considered particularly formidable.</p><p></p><p>But the Immortal Emperor realm cultivators ascending from the lower realms were different!</p><p></p><p>Like Chu Lingxian, Gu Yinyang, and the others, they had limitless potential. Once they arrived in the Ancestral Celestial Realm, freed from the restrictions of their previous world, their cultivation would advance at an astounding pace!</p><p></p><p>So whenever Immortal Emperors ascended from the lower realms, the Divine Emperor's Palace would generally send someone to meet with them.</p><p></p><p>If they displayed exceptional talent and potential, the Divine Emperor's Palace might even directly appoint them to the position of Divine King!</p><p></p><p>It was a long-term investment, so to speak.</p><p></p><p>This was the reason why Ye Wutian had repeatedly obstructed their divine path, even attempting to have Chu Lingxian, Gu Yinyang, and the others eliminated by the Yurong Demon Clan!</p><p></p><p>If Chu Lingxian and the other Immortal Emperors were of average talent, it would be fine. But if any of them possessed extraordinary aptitude, they would undoubtedly be appointed as Divine Kings by the Divine Emperor's Palace!</p><p></p><p>Ye Wutian and the other Divine Kings did not dare take that risk. With so many Divine Kings already, there would not be enough positions for those lowly insects from the lower realms to divide among themselves.</p><p></p><p>So the solution was... to nip them in the bud.</p><p></p><p>"Who asked this time?" Ye Wutian stared intently at the solemn-faced Lin Chuan.</p><p></p><p>Lin Chuan furrowed his brows deeply, returning Ye Wutian's gaze as he spoke word by word, "The... First... Guardian."</p><p></p><p>Ye Wutian's pupils shrank, and he exclaimed in disbelief, "The Guardian?!"</p><p></p><p>Lin Chuan pressed his lips together and solemnly nodded.</p><p></p><p>"Impossible!" Ye Wutian suddenly waved his sleeve and exclaimed, "How could the Guardian, a being of such stature, concern himself with such a trivial matter!"</p><p></p><p>Lin Chuan sighed, remaining silent, for the facts were as they were.</p><p></p><p>Ye Wutian noticed his own outburst and calmed his emotions, urgently asking, "Then how did you respond to the Guardian?"</p><p></p><p>Lin Chuan replied, "I told the Guardian that those Immortal Emperors of the Four Realms should ascend soon... at the latest within a thousand years, and the Guardian then severed communication."</p><p></p><p>Hearing this, Ye Wutian let out a slight sigh of relief, looking at Lin Chuan with approval. "Good, Sword Wielder, your response was appropriate, delaying it for a thousand years should be sufficient."</p><p></p><p>He then spoke in a cold tone, "Sword Wielder, listen closely!"</p><p></p><p>Lin Chuan immediately stood up and bowed.</p><p></p><p>Ye Wutian said icily, "We can no longer delay. This time, drastic measures are required. Within this final time limit, I order you, by whatever means necessary... to find those four Immortal Emperors and that turtle, and slay them!"</p><p></p><p>"Lin Chuan... accepts the order." Lin Chuan's heart trembled as he replied in a hoarse voice.</p><p></p><p>He inwardly lamented that the Divine Celestial Realm was so vast, finding those people would not be easy, otherwise they would not have dragged it out until now.</p><p></p><p>Previously, he had indeed...</p><p></p><p>Here is the full English translation of the Chinese excerpt:</p><p></p><p>The little one has exchanged blows, and those four Immortal Emperors are still fine, and they have not yet grown much. But that turtle is extremely troublesome, its defense is really tough!</p><p></p><p>After they escaped last time, I couldn't find them again. Whether I can find them this time is uncertain...</p><p></p><p>"Hmph." Ye Wutian naturally knew what Lin Chuan was thinking, and the Saintly King's Decree appeared in his hand, which he threw over.</p><p></p><p>Lin Chuan caught it in surprise, then heard Ye Wutian's voice:</p><p></p><p>"This time I grant you the Saintly King's Decree to assist you. I hope the Sword Cultivator won't let this king down..."</p><p></p><p>Lin Chuan gripped the Saintly King's Decree and sighed lightly, then cupped his hands and said, "Saintly King, Lin Chuan... will do my best."</p><p></p><p>"Not just your best, but you must succeed! If you can't find those few in a thousand years, you might as well stop being a Sword Cultivator!" Ye Wutian's face turned icy cold, and a powerful aura swept over him!</p><p></p><p>Ye Wutian was not satisfied with Lin Chuan's attitude, thinking that he might have been too gentle with him in the past.</p><p></p><p>Boom!</p><p></p><p>Lin Chuan's face turned pale, and he stumbled to his knees, wiping the blood from the corner of his mouth and saying in a deep voice, "Yes, Your Majesty!"</p><p></p><p>"Go." Ye Wutian turned around, and suddenly tilted his head and said solemnly, "Oh yes, this king doesn't know why Xing Shou has suddenly paid attention to the Four Immortal Realms, but since Xing Shou is concerned, then quietly build a defense line far away from the Saintly King's Palace, don't let those few ants have a chance to approach the Immortal Emperor's Palace!"</p><p></p><p>"Yes, Your Majesty!"</p><p></p><p>...</p><p></p><p>In the remote wilderness outside Yanwu Town.</p><p></p><p>The thunderclouds in the sky dispersed.</p><p></p><p>Yuan Yang Qiu descended from the high sky, leaning against a tree and panting heavily, but his eyes were extremely excited!</p><p></p><p>At this moment, he was in a disheveled state, his face blackened, his hair disheveled, his chest covered in bloodstains, and one of his arms was broken...</p><p></p><p>The lightning tribulation came too suddenly, and he was completely unprepared.</p><p></p><p>Originally, according to his calculations, the lightning tribulation of the Five Transformation Immortal Emperor should not have arrived for at least ten thousand years.</p><p></p><p>But today...</p><p></p><p>Just that cup of tea...just that terrifying tea in the medical house!</p><p></p><p>It forcibly saturated his Immortal Qi at the Four Transformation Immortal Emperor realm, and summoned the lightning tribulation!</p><p></p><p>Thinking about that cup of tea, his throat was extremely dry.</p><p></p><p>The rare Jade Maiden Mysterious Body... compared to his surging ten thousand years of cultivation, it was practically worthless!!</p><p></p><p>Even if Souluo Linyi obtained the Jade Maiden Mysterious Body and cultivated with him, the benefits he would gain from it would be far less than that one cup of tea, more direct and more violent!</p><p></p><p>The Jade Maiden Mysterious Body is good, but it requires time to grow and settle, compared to the brutal and direct tea... it's nothing.</p><p></p><p>Moreover... Yuan Yang Qiu suddenly thought of the mysterious blue-robed cultivator in the medical house.</p><p></p><p>After taking a deep breath of relief, a fierce killing intent suddenly erupted in his eyes!!</p><p></p><p>It was directed at Souluo Linyi!!</p><p></p><p>To be able to casually serve such a precious tea... Yuan Yang Qiu could not imagine how powerful that blue-robed cultivator must be!</p><p></p><p>No wonder... Souluo Linyi asked him to bring that little girl to her.</p><p></p><p>With Yuan Yang Qiu's cautious nature, he had actually been a little suspicious before, wondering why Souluo Linyi didn't come to the medical house with him.</p><p></p><p>Now he understood!</p><p></p><p>That bitch Souluo Linyi must have some understanding of the blue-robed cultivator's strength, and for the sake of insurance, she was afraid of sinking in the ditch, so she had him, Yuan Yang Qiu, come to test the waters!</p><p></p><p>If he succeeded in obtaining it, it would be fine, but if he failed, he, Yuan Yang Qiu, would die without a burial place, while she, Souluo Linyi, could remain uninvolved!</p><p></p><p>"What a Souluo Linyi, truly a vicious and calculating woman... quite impressive."</p><p></p><p>Yuan Yang Qiu gave a cold smile.</p><p></p><p>After a moment, Yuan Yang Qiu put away his killing intent and staggered to his feet. He looked towards Yanwu Town, his mind filled with the mysterious blue-robed cultivator, hesitating for a moment, but still chose to return to that medical house.</p>

        <h1>Chapter 516</h1>
        <div class="content">
            <p>Here is the full English translation of the Chinese excerpt:</p><p></p><p>"Rumble, rumble, rumbleâ€”!"</p><p></p><p>The old turtle let out a startled cry, and the space occupied by the Devouring Sage Demon Army began to shake. In the blink of an eye, it split into ten parts and started folding like the pages of a book!</p><p></p><p>The Devouring Sage Demon Army trapped within was suddenly thrown into disarray, their expressions finally becoming somewhat panicked!</p><p></p><p>Bizarre! Such a technique, they had never heard of or seen before. They never imagined that this endless void would also possess such profound methods, and they could not underestimate it.</p><p></p><p>"Don't be reckless!! Our Devouring Sage Demon Clan has sturdy bodies, this mere spatial compression cannot destroy us!!"</p><p></p><p>Soon, a Sage Demon Lord roared out, and with his bare hands, he blasted a massive hole through the compressing space, then led countless Devouring Sages in escaping through the hole!</p><p></p><p>Seeing this, the many Devouring Sages calmed down, imitating the Sage Demon Lord to blast open the spatial walls and escape.</p><p></p><p>In the end, although countless Devouring Sages escaped from the spatial walls, one-tenth of them were still swept away by the space and disappeared, their fate unknown.</p><p></p><p>At this moment, the soul body amplified a hundredfold by the old turtle frantically attacked the Devouring Sage Demon Army!</p><p></p><p>At the same time, the ghosts and goblins surged forth, and a massive suction force erupted from the abyss of the Reincarnation Demon Child, indiscriminately devouring the Devouring Sages and the soul body.</p><p></p><p>"Insects seeking death!"</p><p></p><p>A group of Sage Demon Lords stood in front, their demonic claws flashing with terrifying halos, and the next moment, they viciously swung them.</p><p></p><p>Swoosh, swoosh, swoosh!</p><p></p><p>"Spiritual Shattering Technique!! Drink!!"</p><p></p><p>At this time, the old turtle, whose face had already turned pale from the massive consumption, finally unleashed the long-brewing annihilation art!</p><p></p><p>Consuming the three supreme arts was truly too much!</p><p></p><p>The annihilation art was formless and traceless, but a great sense of crisis lingered in the minds of the Devouring Sages.</p><p></p><p>This person actually wanted to attack their minds with unknown methods? Damn it, how did he know their weakness!</p><p></p><p>The formation of the Devouring Sage Demon Army was disrupted again!</p><p></p><p>Boom!!</p><p></p><p>In the next instant, a terrifying sense of annihilation erupted in the minds of the Devouring Sages.</p><p></p><p>Except for the Sage Demon Lords and the Sage Demon Emperor, who fared a little better, the rest of the Devouring Sages let out agonizing screams and many instantly lost their lives!!</p><p></p><p>...</p><p></p><p>The beings watching this scene had their eyes shining brightly, becoming excited! Although the Devouring Sage Demons were numerous and mighty, based on the current situation, the Venerable Dao did not seem to lack the power to fight them!</p><p></p><p>But soon, the people noticed the gloomy expressions of the eight Sage Demon Gods, and the murderous intent seemed to be about to spill out of the screen! They were immediately alarmed!</p><p></p><p>...</p><p></p><p>"Seeking death!!"</p><p></p><p>Seviel raged, suddenly extending a demonic claw and pointing it at the old turtle, his eyes flashing with murderous intent.</p><p></p><p>He had truly underestimated these insects!</p><p></p><p>"Die for my sake!"</p><p></p><p>Seviel let out a fierce roar, and endless energy erupted from the tip of his demonic claw, transforming into countless web-like black energy that shot towards the old turtle.</p><p></p><p>As the one involved, the old turtle's face changed, and he turned his head to look, only to see Seviel's deadly attack!</p><p></p><p>He was horrified to find that he was firmly locked in place, and his body could not move at all!</p><p></p><p>The old turtle was suddenly terrified!!</p><p></p><p>"Old Turtle!!"</p><p></p><p>Hunhun, seeing this, was anxious, but he was busy controlling all the soul bodies and could not spare a hand.</p><p></p><p>...</p><p></p><p>The beings watching the tense scene were also greatly alarmed.</p><p></p><p>"Clang!"</p><p></p><p>But at this moment, a sharp sword sound rang out from the screen!</p><p></p><p>The beings then saw the man who had been quietly standing there draw his sword!</p><p></p><p>The sword qi was fierce, and with lightning-fast speed, it easily tore apart the countless web-like black energy released by Seviel.</p><p></p><p>"Good!!!"</p><p></p><p>The beings exclaimed in delight, vigorously waving their arms.</p><p></p><p>He truly was their Venerable Dao of the Endless Void!</p><p></p><p>...</p><p></p><p>The old turtle, having narrowly escaped death, was panting heavily. He gratefully glanced at Lu Changsheng, then began to frantically recover, as their situation was not very optimistic.</p><p></p><p>"Hmm?"</p><p></p><p>Seviel suddenly fixed his gaze on Lu Changsheng!</p><p></p><p>The other seven Sage Demon Gods and hundreds of Sage Demon Emperors also eyed him with predatory gazes.</p><p></p><p>Lu Changsheng smiled faintly, and then, in the gaze of all, he slowly raised his sword and began to walk towards Seviel and the others.</p><p></p><p>Here is the full English translation of the Chinese excerpt:</p><p></p><p>Remembering Lu Changsheng's words, he hurriedly followed closely behind!</p><p></p><p>"Today, I will put an end to you maggots."</p><p></p><p>Lu Changsheng said indifferently, holding a long sword and dragging it on the ground, with sparks flying everywhere!</p><p></p><p>Seeing this, many of the surrounding Xikong Saint Demons rushed towards Lu Changsheng one after another, but before they could get close, they were all exploded into a bloody mist!</p><p></p><p>Soon, the Xikong Saint Demon army was so frightened that they dared not approach, and could only decisively turn around to continue fighting with Hunhui and the others!</p><p></p><p>Saevil's eyes turned cold, and he sneered: "Put an end to it? How do you plan to put an end to it? I admit that you have some strength, but it's still far from enough. Who doesn't know how to talk big!?"</p><p></p><p>Lu Changsheng's gaze was calm, and he opened his left palm, revealing the Dao Suppressing Demon Tower that emitted a colorful halo, hovering above his palm.</p><p></p><p>Saevil and the other demons' eyes were filled with surprise, because they could vaguely feel that this little tower had a mysterious suppressive power over them!</p><p></p><p>"Kill him!!"</p><p></p><p>Saevil decisively shouted.</p><p></p><p>As soon as the words fell, the eight Saint Demon Gods and hundreds of Saint Demon Emperors turned into ink shadows and rushed up, unleashing a powerful momentum that swept across the top of the Creation Pillar!</p><p></p><p>Below the Creation Pillar, countless nebulae trembled, with a mighty power shaking the heavens!</p><p></p><p>Lu Changsheng's eyes turned slightly cold, and the Dao Suppressing Demon Tower in his hand flashed and instantly transformed into a mountain-sized tower, accompanied by the sound of the Dao, heavily pressing down, easily trapping Saevil and the other demons inside!</p><p></p><p>Seeing this, the crowd was stunned, and then burst into cheers!!</p><p></p><p>The terrifying Xikong Saint Demons were actually suppressed so easily by the Dao Lord?</p><p></p><p>"Boom! Boom! Boom! Boom! Boom!"</p><p></p><p>Suddenly, a huge commotion resounded, as the Xikong Saint Demons were frantically attacking the Dao Suppressing Demon Tower from the inside!</p><p></p><p>The mighty Dao Suppressing Demon Tower was actually starting to tremble!</p><p></p><p>Seeing this, the crowd's faces turned pale, and they quickly suppressed their joy. Indeed, the Xikong Saint Demons were not so easy to deal with!</p><p></p><p>Even though they were suppressed by such a precious treasure of the Dao Lord, they could still resist!</p><p></p><p>At the same time, Lu Changsheng suddenly slashed a sword towards the battlefield where Hunhui and the old turtle were!</p><p></p><p>After the sword slash, he decisively waved his sleeve and entered the Dao Suppressing Demon Tower with He Xitong.</p><p></p><p>"Jing!!!"</p><p></p><p>The sharp sword cry echoed, and the azure sword qi, wherever it passed, caused the space to collapse layer by layer.</p><p></p><p>"Block it!!!" A Saint Demon Lord saw this and shouted in horror.</p><p></p><p>Seeing the invincible azure sword qi coming, the Xikong Saint Demon army instantly collapsed in their hearts.</p><p></p><p>They understood that this person had temporarily confined the Saint Demon Gods with the precious treasure, just to seize the opportunity to slash towards their side of the battlefield.</p><p></p><p>In less than a breath, the sword qi arrived!!</p><p></p><p>"Swoosh swoosh swoosh--!!"</p><p></p><p>The azure sword qi was extremely sharp, and wherever it passed, the space was shattered, along with countless Xikong Saint Demons and soul bodies being slashed into nothingness.</p><p></p><p>The Xikong Saint Demons, known for their extremely hard bodies, were easily defeated under this one sword strike!!</p><p></p><p>With this one sword strike, the millions of Xikong Saint Demon army was directly reduced to only one-tenth!</p><p></p><p>The crowd was stunned and dumbfounded!</p><p></p><p>The old turtle and Hunhui also had expressions of great shock, and then heaved a sigh of relief!!</p><p></p><p>It was really the Dao Lord, with just one casual sword strike, the effect was better than their fighting for half a day.</p><p></p><p>With Lu Changsheng's help, they suddenly felt much more relaxed.</p><p></p><p>However, they could not be careless, even if only one-tenth remained, it was still enough to give them a hard time.</p><p></p><p>They continued the battle on their side, and the Qiongqi and Luoluo were already severely injured, missing limbs and broken legs, and even Hunhui and the old turtle had consumed a great deal.</p><p></p><p>It can be said that without Lu Changsheng's one sword strike, they would have been defeated.</p><p></p><p>At the same time, even more violent and thunderous sounds came from the Dao Suppressing Demon Tower!</p><p></p><p>"Boom! Boom! Boom! Boom! Boom!"</p><p></p><p>No one knew the situation inside, but such a commotion showed how intense the battle was.</p><p></p><p>The crowd's eyes were filled with great concern, after all, the Dao Lord was not facing a one-on-one, but facing the combined forces of the Xikong Saint Demons, including the eight Saint Demon Gods.</p><p></p><p>"Crack!"</p><p></p><p>Suddenly, a crack appeared on the body of the Dao Suppressing Demon Tower.</p>

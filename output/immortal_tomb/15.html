        <h1>Chapter 15</h1>
        <div class="content">
            <p>Here is the full English translation of the Chinese excerpt:</p><p></p><p>"But haven't those places been impenetrable secrets for countless ages?" </p><p></p><p>Seeing the burly man ask such questions, the other Demon Kings also nodded in agreement.</p><p></p><p>"Qing Chao, the Demon Sovereign has been to that place many times before, but returned empty-handed. However, after all these years, the Demon Sovereign has come up with a plan, and she wants to try it... This is the reason why she wants to start a war..."</p><p></p><p>Zhao Shenyuan smiled mysteriously, the black depths of his eyes gleaming with unprecedented excitement!</p><p></p><p>This really had the four Demon Kings in a panic. What was he being so coy about? Just spit it out already! They felt like countless ants were crawling all over them!</p><p></p><p>Chu Qingchao scratched his head in frustration: "Zhao Shenyuan, just tell us already!"</p><p></p><p>Zhao Shenyuan's lips curled into a smirk, and with a "poof" he vanished into a black mist, his mocking laughter echoing behind.</p><p></p><p>"Hahaha! Keep guessing, I won't entertain you any further!"</p><p></p><p>Boom!!!</p><p></p><p>Chu Qingchao angrily punched a distant withered tree, reducing it to powder, with many crows meeting a tragic end.</p><p></p><p>"Zhao Shenyuan, you bastard! Talking in riddles! It's driving me crazy! I have to go ask the Demon Sovereign myself!"</p><p></p><p>This alarmed the other three Demon Kings, who hurriedly held him back.</p><p></p><p>"Qingchao, do you want to die? How dare you go ask the Demon Sovereign? If the Demon Sovereign wanted to tell us, she would have already. Does Zhao Shenyuan need to say it?"</p><p></p><p>Chu Qingchao's expression wilted, and he impatiently waved his hand: "Forget it! We'll know eventually! Come, you guys keep me company and we'll go drink!"</p><p></p><p>"Alright, alright, we'll go with you. Sigh."</p><p></p><p>The other three Demon Kings agreed, as they indeed needed to drink to calm their agitated minds at the moment.</p><p></p><p>...</p><p></p><p>In the Lishui Empire.</p><p></p><p>In the imperial palace.</p><p></p><p>"Your Majesty, the news has come that in recent days, most of the towns in the eastern part of the empire have been overrun by demons. Even Jiayuan City has seen the reappearance of demons, even though the immortal had said he had exterminated them there. What are we to do?"</p><p></p><p>"Yes, it's been six days since the immortal left, and he still hasn't returned... At this rate, the capital of the Lishui Empire will soon be in grave danger!"</p><p></p><p>"Alas, these demons are far too powerful. Some Taoists who volunteered to go have disappeared without a trace, likely meeting their demise..."</p><p></p><p>"..."</p><p></p><p>Boom!!!</p><p></p><p>At this moment, the Lishui Emperor seated on the throne suddenly slammed his fist on the table!</p><p></p><p>The imperial hall fell silent, with all the officials bowing their heads, not daring to speak further.</p><p></p><p>"I've raised a bunch of useless fools!" </p><p></p><p>The Lishui Emperor roared angrily, the veins on his neck bulging.</p><p></p><p>"Your Majesty, please calm down!" </p><p></p><p>The officials trembled, quickly kneeling.</p><p></p><p>"Hmph! Don't give me that useless talk. Either come up with a solution, or shut up! Your buzzing is giving me a headache! A bunch of good-for-nothings!"</p><p>The Lishui Emperor had never been this furious before.</p><p></p><p>The officials lowered their heads, their eyes flashing with resentment, inwardly thinking, "Pot calling the kettle black, you're a useless king too."</p><p></p><p>"Enough! Didn't I order you to report the casualties among the commoners every day? Where's today's report?"</p><p></p><p>The Lishui Emperor's face darkened as he waved his sleeve.</p><p></p><p>The middle-aged official stood up and solemnly reported: "Your Majesty, the death toll in Jiayuan City has risen to one thousand, in Pingyang City to eight hundred, in Taiping City to seven hundred... And the cities are about to lose control of the crazed commoners."</p><p></p><p>As the middle-aged official made his report, the imperial hall fell even more silent.</p><p></p><p>Too many, too many deaths. No city had a death toll below three hundred...</p><p></p><p>Adding them all up, it was a terrifying number.</p><p></p><p>"The heavens truly want to destroy my Lishui Empire..."</p><p></p><p>The Lishui Emperor stumbled and fell back onto the throne, lost in a daze.</p><p></p><p>He had also contacted the neighboring empires recently, and they were all peaceful, with only minor demon problems, if any. </p><p></p><p>Why was it that only his Lishui Empire was plagued by such horrifying demons?</p><p></p><p>Here is the full English translation of the Chinese excerpt:</p><p></p><p>He was in the mountain ridges outside the eastern border of the Water Empire, wasn't there the legendary tomb of the immortals?</p><p></p><p>The geographical location was so auspicious, he should have been prospering greatly in the Water Empire, but why was it like this?!</p><p></p><p>The middle-aged official below seemed to have thought of something, after pondering for a moment, he respectfully said: "Oh yes, Your Majesty, your subject also has a strange matter to report......"</p><p></p><p>The King of the Water Nation regained his senses, straightened his body, and rubbed his aching temples: "Speak."</p><p></p><p>The middle-aged official hesitated and said, "Your Majesty, there is a rather special town in the eastern part of the Empire, with very few deaths, only sixty-seven people, and the death toll there has not been continuously rising like other towns...Because it is relatively remote, your subject only received the information there yesterday."</p><p></p><p>The King of the Water Nation and all the officials suddenly became more spirited, looking at the middle-aged official in amazement.</p><p></p><p>There's such a thing?</p><p></p><p>"What town are you talking about?" The King of the Water Nation stared intently at the middle-aged official.</p><p></p><p>"Moyu Town."</p><p></p><p>The middle-aged official said in a solemn voice.</p><p></p><p>Moyu Town...</p><p></p><p>"What did the town lord there say?"</p><p></p><p>Like a drowning man grasping at a straw, the King of the Water Nation hurriedly asked.</p><p></p><p>The middle-aged official sighed, "Your Majesty, the town lord of Moyu Town said that there does seem to have been a demon appearing in Moyu Town, but after killing sixty-seven people, it just disappeared as if by magic...Moyu Town has not been troubled by demons since then...He said he doesn't know the reason either."</p><p></p><p>The main hall fell silent, and everyone frowned tightly.</p><p></p><p>"I understand!!"</p><p></p><p>Suddenly, an elderly official exclaimed excitedly, interrupting everyone's contemplation.</p><p></p><p>"Oh? Elder Dong, what are your thoughts? Please share," the King of the Water Nation asked, looking at the elderly official.</p><p></p><p>Aside from this demonic calamity, this elderly official had indeed understood a great deal in the past, and his thoughts were easy to grasp, able to come up with angles that ordinary people couldn't.</p><p></p><p>The other officials were also surprised to look at Dong Ge.</p><p></p><p>"Hehe, Your Majesty, I'm afraid I've already figured out why such miraculous things have happened in Moyu Town!" </p><p></p><p>Dong Ge stood up and said confidently.</p><p></p><p>"Elder Dong, the matter is urgent, so please speak quickly!" The King of the Water Nation said sternly.</p><p></p><p>"Hehe, Your Majesty, colleagues, do you know the main feature of Moyu Town?" Dong Ge asked with a smile.</p><p></p><p>The other officials were dumbfounded, while the King of the Water Nation's face darkened again. This old fellow, let him just say it directly without wasting time, he's just showing off again!!</p><p></p><p>Seeing the King of the Water Nation's expression, Dong Ge became flustered and quickly said:</p><p></p><p>"It's like this, Your Majesty! Of all the towns in the eastern part of the Empire, the one closest to that immortal tomb is Moyu Town, which is not far from the border! I'm thinking that perhaps Moyu Town just happens to be within the protection range of the immortal tomb, that's why it makes sense!"</p><p></p><p>Slap!</p><p></p><p>The people unanimously slapped their hands in sudden enlightenment! It all made sense now! Except for this explanation, the others didn't make sense either!</p><p></p><p>Indeed, in critical moments, it was still Counselor Dong who came through.</p><p></p><p>At this moment, the King of the Water Nation's eyes suddenly emitted an unprecedented brilliance, and he abruptly stood up, waving his big arm and shouting:</p><p></p><p>"Issue an order! All the affected townspeople in the east, bring enough water and provisions, and relocate to the surrounding areas of Moyu Town! The tents will be provided by the military department! As for other matters, you officials should make preparations!"</p><p></p><p>"Oh yes, all you beloved officials will also accompany me to camp there! We cannot afford any mishaps, for if we have problems, the Water Empire will truly be doomed!"</p><p></p><p>The officials were stunned, there was such an operation? But what about the south, west, and north? Although no demonic calamity has occurred there yet, who knows what might happen.</p><p></p><p>"Of course, I know what you are all worried about, we will go to the Moyu Town area first to take a look, and if it is indeed safe, then we will also have the people from the south, west, and north move there if demons start to appear there as well."</p><p></p><p>The King of the Water Nation said hoarsely, this was the only option left...</p><p></p><p>As for the immortal from the Qingyun Sect, time did not allow him to wait any longer...</p><p></p><p>Meanwhile,</p><p></p><p>In the backyard of Moyu Town, Lu Changsheng, who was sitting cross-legged, suddenly opened his eyes and sighed lightly.</p>

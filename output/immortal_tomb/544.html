        <h1>Chapter 544</h1>
        <div class="content">
            <p>Here is my translation of the Chinese excerpt:</p><p></p><p>Outside the Qiuqing Pavilion, there was a large crowd gathered. It was because Zuichenci had brought Wangsu and the others here. Wangsu and the others looked around the Qiuqing Pavilion suspiciously, wondering why this old man had brought them to this place of romantic charm. </p><p></p><p>Han Yue and Ye Xiaoxiao were still just children - how could they be in a brothel? </p><p></p><p>"This is the place, you all go in yourselves," Zuichenci said with a smile.</p><p></p><p>"If we go in and don't see those two children, do you know what will happen to you?" an elder of the sect glared at Zuichenci and demanded.</p><p></p><p>"If they really are inside, how could old Xu dare to deceive you all? If they are not there, old Xu is at your disposal," Zuichenci sighed and cupped his hands.</p><p></p><p>Cao Yulong and the other townspeople frowned, not knowing what old Xu was up to, but they were very worried - if old Xu offended these people, he would likely have no place to be buried.</p><p></p><p>Some people, concerned for old Xu, quietly left the crowd and ran towards the Changsheng Academy, intending to seek help from Lu Changsheng.</p><p></p><p>Suddenly, a huge commotion erupted - the wall of the Qiuqing Pavilion was blasted open, startling the townspeople. Two figures were then shot out like cannonballs, crashing heavily to the ground. They were Songren and the elder, coughing up blood, their bones completely shattered except for their skulls. </p><p></p><p>Wangsu and the others were shocked, realizing there must be a powerful expert within the Qiuqing Pavilion. At this moment, a young man in blue robes slowly approached the entrance, accompanied by Huangyulang, the madam, and some girls and customers. Upon seeing this young man, Wangsu and the others felt a chill and their legs began to weaken.</p><p></p><p>"Mr. Lu," Cao Yulong and the townspeople hurriedly greeted.</p><p></p><p>Lu Changsheng glanced at Zuichenci, who felt guilty and coughed, avoiding his gaze. Lu Changsheng spoke softly, "I was just listening to the music, and you all came barging in, forcing the courtesans to stop playing, disturbing my enjoyment, and disrupting everyone else's mood. Who gave you the nerve? Was it old Xu?"</p><p></p><p>Wangsu quickly pointed at Zuichenci, saying, "Yes, yes! This old wretch did it on purpose to lure us here!"</p><p></p><p>Here is the full English translation of the Chinese excerpt:</p><p></p><p>"Yes, sir, it is this old man. If he had told us that you were here, we would not have dared to come here!" </p><p></p><p>"......"</p><p></p><p>The elders of the various sects also seemed to have grasped at a lifeline, hastily explaining:</p><p></p><p>Little did they know, Zui Qiancheng's eyes swept over them coldly, and then he hurriedly waved to Lu Changsheng, chuckling awkwardly:</p><p></p><p>"Mr. Lu, you misunderstand, it's not that Old Xu deliberately brought them here. They came here to look for Han Yue and Ye Xiaoxiao. When Old Xu saw them troubling the Magistrate and other villagers, he was anxious and instinctively brought them here. Old Xu thought you were Han Yue and Ye Xiaoxiao's teacher, so he brought them here!"</p><p></p><p>The villagers, hearing this, hurriedly spoke up for Zui Qiancheng:</p><p></p><p>"Yes, Mr. Lu, please be magnanimous, don't treat Old Xu the same way, he was also doing it for us......"</p><p></p><p>"Mr. Lu, please don't give Old Xu a hard time, Old Xu is a good person."</p><p></p><p>"......"</p><p></p><p>Lu Changsheng chuckled, looking at Zui Qiancheng meaningfully, and then suddenly said indifferently, "Who told you people to stand and talk to me?"</p><p></p><p>Cao Yulong and the villagers were startled and were about to kneel down immediately!</p><p></p><p>"Not you." Lu Changsheng said.</p><p></p><p>The crowd immediately relaxed, stopping their kneeling posture, their hearts pounding rapidly.</p><p></p><p>Mr. Lu was usually smiling and friendly with them, but whenever he got serious, he was really frightening!</p><p></p><p>Boom, boom, boom, boom, boom......</p><p></p><p>The next moment, the elders of the various sects, including Wang Sao, unhesitatingly knelt down.</p><p></p><p>They only hoped that they could survive today!</p><p></p><p>Huang Yulang had someone bring a stool, which Lu Changsheng sat down on, and he asked with a smile, "Report your names."</p><p></p><p>Wang Sao trembled and said first, "Reporting to the Lord, Tianwu Sect, Outer Sect Elder, Wang, Wang Sao."</p><p></p><p>"Banglong Sect, Inner Sect Elder, Chen......"</p><p></p><p>"......"</p><p></p><p>The various sect elders then honestly reported their names one by one.</p><p></p><p>Each name and sect caused Cao Yulong and the villagers' faces to change drastically!!</p><p></p><p>The middle-aged and elderly people kneeling before them were actually all high-level elders of the major martial sects of the Star Luo Empire!!</p><p></p><p>Whew!!</p><p></p><p>How terrifying!</p><p></p><p>Doesn't that mean that Mr. Lu has offended all the major martial sects, including the mighty Tianwu Sect, all at once?!</p><p></p><p>Cao Yulong, Huang Yulang and the villagers turned deathly pale, not daring to stay any longer!</p><p></p><p>But Lu Changsheng did not speak, so they dared not move.</p><p></p><p>The crowd looked at Lu Changsheng, but found that after hearing the many sect names, his expression had not changed at all, still calm and indifferent.</p><p></p><p>This aura of strength, Mr. Lu is truly invincible and increasingly mysterious!</p><p></p><p>"Hmm, so what are you here for?" Lu Changsheng asked with a smile.</p><p></p><p>The sect elders trembled, hesitating to speak!</p><p></p><p>Wang Sao was already drenched in sweat, his nerves constantly tense under the immense invisible pressure!</p><p></p><p>Song Ren didn't lie to him, not at all!</p><p></p><p>This person, just by sitting there, every word and smile made people's hearts shudder with fear!</p><p></p><p>This terrifying sense of oppression was even stronger than that of a Sect Master!</p><p></p><p>When did the Star Luo Empire have such a domineering and powerful expert!</p><p></p><p>Yes, Wang Sao had already confirmed that Lu Changsheng was not from the Star Luo Empire.</p><p></p><p>Lu Changsheng frowned slightly, "I asked you a question, can't you hear?"</p><p></p><p>The sect elders were startled.</p><p></p><p>"Reporting to the Lord, we came for the two Earth Veins." One elder hurriedly said.</p><p></p><p>The scene fell silent.</p><p></p><p>Lu Changsheng nodded lightly, "I see, so you've come here for that. But..."</p><p></p><p>The crowd was extremely nervous.</p><p></p><p>Lu Changsheng looked at the lying Song Ren and continued, "But you, Tianwu Sect, what is the meaning of your coming to this Jixing Village this time?"</p><p></p><p>Song Ren's face was bitter as he opened his mouth with difficulty, "My...my lord..."</p><p></p><p>He was just an attendant, he really had no choice, he was just unlucky that this matter fell on him... He actually didn't want to come at all...</p><p></p><p>Wang Sao was also trembling all over, a sense of foreboding enveloping him!</p><p></p><p>He said with difficulty, "My...my lord, I know I'm wrong... We are from the Tianwu Sect, and I hope the lord will forgive us this time."</p><p></p><p>Wang Sao sensed the crisis of death and could only invoke the backing of his sect.</p><p></p><p>Just as the crowd thought Lu Changsheng would hesitate and be conflicted...</p><p></p><p>Lu Changsheng said lightly, "Tianwu Sect? What is that?"</p>

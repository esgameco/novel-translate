        <h1>Chapter 13</h1>
        <div class="content">
            <p>Here is the full English translation of the Chinese excerpt:</p><p></p><p>"Pfft! Arrogant cultivator, shamelessly thinking you're capable just because you've reached the Foundation Establishment stage! A celestial being? Have you ever seen a celestial being?"</p><p></p><p>The three demonic black snakes were truly about to go mad with rage. </p><p></p><p>They had never seen such a shameless cultivator before!</p><p></p><p>Today was truly a case of a small knife stabbing one's own butt - they had opened their eyes, and indeed, the world was full of wonders.</p><p></p><p>L端 Changsheng looked at the three furious black-tongued demons without saying anything further, casually waving his sleeve.</p><p></p><p>There was no fluctuation of spiritual power, no dazzling and spectacular techniques.</p><p></p><p>The three black snake demons just froze there in a bizarre manner.</p><p></p><p>"Ugh..."</p><p></p><p>The three black-tongued demons were dumbfounded.</p><p></p><p>Soon, their hearts were pounding violently, their eyeballs nearly popping out in shock!</p><p></p><p>Their... their bodies seemed to have been constrained by an invisible and unfamiliar force?!</p><p></p><p>Even more terrifying was that the force constraining them... was not spiritual power at all!! Of course, they had dealt with cultivators before and were familiar with spiritual power.</p><p></p><p>How could this be...?</p><p></p><p>"Ju-just who are you?!" </p><p></p><p>The lead black-tongued demon glared at L端 Changsheng with an extremely unsightly expression. Looking closely through the darkness, his gaze was already filled with fear!</p><p></p><p>This bizarre method... even if someone told him the young man in blue was a terrifying Nascent Soul old monster, he would believe it!</p><p></p><p>L端 Changsheng smiled and, with his hands behind his back, took a step back and disappeared ghostly.</p><p></p><p>"What does he mean by not killing us...?"</p><p></p><p>Before the three black-tongued demons could feel relieved, the invisible force constraining them suddenly contracted violently!</p><p></p><p>"Ahhh!!!"</p><p></p><p>After that heart-wrenching scream, they "exploded" into a mist of blood!</p><p></p><p>...</p><p></p><p>That chilling scream could be heard throughout the entire Moyu Town.</p><p></p><p>The commoners tightly shut their doors, many trembling on their beds.</p><p></p><p>This was not a sound a human could make...</p><p></p><p>It must be a demonic creature!</p><p></p><p>But why did the sound seem to be of the utmost agony?</p><p></p><p>In the Magistrate's Residence.</p><p></p><p>Chen Dadao and the steward stared at each other in shock.</p><p></p><p>"Mast-master, hearing that agonizing howl, could it be that the gentleman has already dealt with the demonic creature?" the steward asked hoarsely, his eyes vacant - it had only been a short while, after all...</p><p></p><p>Chen Dadao suppressed the shock in his eyes and abruptly waved his hand: "Steward, let's go! Bring some good wine to pay our respects to the gentleman!"</p><p></p><p>With that, he rushed out, directly bumping into the Garrison Commander who was about to report.</p><p></p><p>"Master, just now in the town..."</p><p></p><p>"The Magistrate has no time for this now, you just stay here!" </p><p></p><p>Chen Dadao waved him off and hurried away without looking back.</p><p></p><p>The Garrison Commander was dumbfounded, looking to the steward for help: "Steward, this..."</p><p></p><p>"Ahem, Garrison Commander, the affairs of the town can wait for now, I have some matters to attend to as well. Farewell."</p><p></p><p>The steward also quickly rushed out, his steps more agile than usual.</p><p></p><p>"Huh? The affairs of the town can wait?" </p><p></p><p>The Garrison Commander watched the retreating figures of Chen Dadao and the steward, completely bewildered.</p><p></p><p>A demonic creature has appeared in the town, and this is not urgent?</p><p></p><p>...</p><p></p><p>In the backyard.</p><p></p><p>Chen Dadao and the steward crept in, as if they were thieves in their own residence. Sure enough, they soon saw the figure seated in the pavilion, and their faces lit up as they hurried over, bowing respectfully.</p><p></p><p>The steward gently placed a tray of wine on the stone table.</p><p></p><p>"Gen-gentleman, this is the wine specially prepared for you by your humble servant," Chen Dadao said reverently, the steward also bowing without daring to look up.</p><p></p><p>As Chen Dadao spoke, he discreetly observed L端 Changsheng's blue robe in the moonlight, but found it to be spotlessly clean, without a trace of blood, causing him to grow slightly anxious.</p><p></p><p>Logically speaking, even if the gentleman was a celestial being, dealing with a demonic...</p><p></p><p>Here is the full English translation of the Chinese excerpt:</p><p></p><p>Long Shengcheng opened his eyes, and with a wave of his hand, he pulled the wine jar on the table towards himself, taking a sip and saying, "Moyu Town has been the same as before, and it will remain the same in the future."</p><p></p><p>This casual gesture of his directly stunned Chen Dadao!</p><p></p><p>Retrieving objects from a distance - a celestial being's technique!</p><p></p><p>"Ah!! Thank you, sir!" </p><p></p><p>After a moment of dumbfoundedness, the realization dawned on Chen Dadao, and he hurriedly and respectfully bowed down to the steward.</p><p></p><p>The answer was already clear - the demonic creature had been slain by the sir...</p><p></p><p>"I may reside in your backyard for a while, you don't mind, do you?" </p><p></p><p>Long Shengcheng swirled the wine jar lightly as he spoke softly.</p><p></p><p>Chen Dadao's body trembled, and he exclaimed joyfully, "Not at all, not at all! Sir, you can stay as long as you wish!!"</p><p></p><p>This was his honor!</p><p></p><p>If possible, he would have no qualms about gifting the Magistrate's Mansion to the sir!</p><p></p><p>However, the Magistrate's Mansion was not his property but belonged to the Lishui Empire, so he had no authority over it.</p><p></p><p>"Mm, you may leave now."</p><p></p><p>Long Shengcheng slowly closed his eyes.</p><p></p><p>"Yes..."</p><p></p><p>Chen Dadao and the steward exchanged a glance, then bowed respectfully towards Long Shengcheng and departed.</p><p></p><p>"Oh, and have that maid leave the backyard as well. I can manage on my own, and there's no need for her to disturb me."</p><p></p><p>Suddenly, Long Shengcheng's voice rang out again.</p><p></p><p>Chen Dadao paused, then turned around and respectfully replied, "Understood."</p><p></p><p>...</p><p></p><p>In the Lishui Palace, the Lishui King's face was filled with confusion as he exclaimed, "What?! You celestial beings are leaving already?"</p><p></p><p>The officials also looked tense.</p><p></p><p>It had only been one night, and they couldn't believe that the demonic creatures had already been eliminated. Even for celestial beings, traveling between various towns and exorcising the demons would be quite a rush, wouldn't it?</p><p></p><p>"Mm, those demonic creatures were quite powerful... We were barely able to handle them. We shall return to our sect and report this matter to our master for further instructions."</p><p></p><p>Tongxin spoke very tactfully.</p><p></p><p>It wasn't just "quite powerful" - if he hadn't had his talisman treasures, he might have even been defeated!</p><p></p><p>At the moment, the outer sect disciples were all outside, not coming in, as they were afraid of being seen by the officials with their injuries and disheveled appearances.</p><p></p><p>"This..." </p><p></p><p>The officials exchanged glances, and the color visibly drained from their faces.</p><p></p><p>Powerful demonic creatures? They were all seasoned officials in the political arena and knew that the young celestial being was definitely downplaying the situation.</p><p></p><p>And with the other celestial beings not present, it was quite suspicious.</p><p></p><p>Could it be... that something had happened?</p><p></p><p>"Celestial beings, if you leave, what will become of my Lishui Empire?" </p><p></p><p>The Lishui King said with a sorrowful expression.</p><p></p><p>"Jiaoyuan City should be stabilized for now, as we have eliminated the three demonic creatures there." Tongxin said, pursing his lips to console them, "Don't worry, once we return and report this to our sect, they will surely take swift action."</p><p></p><p>Reaching this point, Tongxin also couldn't maintain a cold demeanor, as he felt somewhat guilty.</p><p></p><p>Initially, he had just wanted to come to the mortal world for a bit of fun, but who knew the situation would be so thorny!</p><p></p><p>With that, Tongxin suddenly turned and headed outside.</p><p></p><p>"Celestial beings! You must hurry! My Lishui Empire relies on you celestial beings!"</p><p></p><p>Seeing this, the Lishui King and the officials hurriedly ran after him.</p><p></p><p>"Don't worry, you should compile the casualty reports for each city, and when our Qingyun Sect sends more celestial beings, be sure to report the details carefully!"</p><p></p><p>At the same time, Tongxin boarded the flying carpet, and the waiting outer sect disciples also hurriedly climbed on, their faces flushed.</p><p></p><p>This scene was witnessed by the Lishui King and the officials who had chased after them.</p><p></p><p>They were dumbfounded.</p><p></p><p>So these celestial beings had been waiting outside all along, but...</p><p></p><p>Why did they look so disheveled, so different from their initial imposing and spirited appearance?</p>

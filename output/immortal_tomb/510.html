        <h1>Chapter 510</h1>
        <div class="content">
            <p>Here is the full English translation of the Chinese excerpt:</p><p></p><p>"Dao Zun, how many mother galaxies are there in that Creation Pillar?"</p><p></p><p>Hunhui hurriedly asked the question on his mind.</p><p></p><p>Lu Changsheng's gaze slightly narrowed as he softly said, "Compared to other galaxies, the number of mother galaxies is not that many, probably around a hundred or so."</p><p></p><p>Hearing this, Hunhui and the old turtle let out a sigh of relief. </p><p></p><p>Compared to that, a hundred or so is indeed very few!</p><p></p><p>After all, the number of galaxies they could see in front of them was likely in the tens of thousands.</p><p></p><p>"However, the mother galaxies are much larger than ordinary galaxies, and the numerous civilized worlds within them are generally quite advanced, I believe you've seen that through the Reincarnation Demon Child," Lu Changsheng said indifferently.</p><p></p><p>The crowd quickly nodded.</p><p></p><p>"Now let's go find the mother galaxy at the bottom of that Creation Pillar and take a look at the situation first."</p><p></p><p>After saying that, Lu Changsheng headed deeper into the depths, at a speed that the old turtle and the others could keep up with.</p><p></p><p>Summoning them out of the Demon-Subduing Tower here was actually a way to let them get familiar with it in advance.</p><p></p><p>Seeing this, the crowd quickly followed.</p><p></p><p>Soon, they disappeared into the dazzling stars along with Lu Changsheng.</p><p></p><p>.........</p><p></p><p>Hundreds of years later, Lu Changsheng and the others finally arrived at the mother galaxy at the bottom of the Eighth Creation Pillar.</p><p></p><p>At first sight, the old turtle and the others were truly shocked.</p><p></p><p>Lu Changsheng had previously said that it would be much larger than ordinary galaxies, but they never imagined it would be this massive, there was really no comparison.</p><p></p><p>The beautiful mother galaxy in front of them was hundreds or even thousands of times larger than all the galaxies they had seen before!</p><p></p><p>The celestial bodies within it were also gigantic, as if they had existed since ancient times!</p><p></p><p>Lu Changsheng's profound gaze traversed through the mother galaxy, quickly locking onto the massive celestial body at the very center, which was the central core world of a galaxy!</p><p></p><p>"Let's go."</p><p></p><p>After saying that, Lu Changsheng waved his sleeve, taking the old turtle and the others with him as they shot into that massive celestial body like an extremely fast beam of light.</p><p></p><p>.........</p><p></p><p>The Hengze Mother Galaxy, the Crimson Abstruse Celestial Realm.</p><p></p><p>Lu Changsheng brought the old turtle and the others to this realm.</p><p></p><p>The old turtle, Hunhui, and the others were immediately stunned by the scene before them.</p><p></p><p>Dilapidated, gloomy, desolate, the entire world was shrouded in a thick aura of death and miasma.</p><p></p><p>At the same time, a heavy stench of rotting corpses assaulted their nostrils!</p><p></p><p>Even though the celestial body had appeared brilliant and dazzling from the outside, upon entering it, the contrast was so stark that it was as if this was a dead world!</p><p></p><p>Was this really the central core world of the mother galaxy?</p><p></p><p>If they hadn't been told in advance, they would have thought this was a dead realm!</p><p></p><p>The Reincarnation Demon Child's eyes flashed with towering hatred!</p><p></p><p>How familiar this world was...</p><p></p><p>Although he did not originate from here, this realm was almost identical to the one he had come from!</p><p></p><p>Lu Changsheng's gaze swept across the distance, as if he could see through the flow of time. He said indifferently, "This world has already fallen into a terminal illness... Old Turtle, if you had not inadvertently awakened me in time, I might still have been wandering, only to regret it when the endless void collapsed."</p><p></p><p>Terminal illness...</p><p></p><p>The old turtle, Hunhui, and the others took a deep breath, their expressions grave.</p><p></p><p>Lu Changsheng's gaze, however, was exceptionally calm, but there was a murderous intent within it.</p><p></p><p>Starting from this mother galaxy, the endless slaughter that followed would be no surprise.</p><p></p><p>"Master, every world with living beings should have a Heavenly Dao, so where is the Heavenly Dao of this world?" the old turtle asked with difficulty.</p><p></p><p>The Heavenly Dao of such a central core world should be terrifyingly powerful.</p><p></p><p>"The Heavenly Dao has long since hidden itself away, and it was right to do so," Lu Changsheng said indifferently, not caring about the shocked crowd, as he tore open the space and entered, "Come, I've already vaguely located the positions of those maggots."</p><p></p><p>The old turtle and the others snapped out of their daze, licking their lips, and quickly entered the spatial rift. They knew that from now on, they had to be swift, accurate, and ruthless, as Lu Changsheng would surely use thunderous methods to annihilate the monsters. After all, there were eight Creation Pillars, and if they were slow, who knows how long it would take!</p><p></p><p>As they entered, the space abruptly closed behind them.</p><p></p><p>.........</p><p></p><p>In the Crimson Abstruse Celestial Realm, the無極Continent (Wuji Continent) of the central region.</p><p></p><p>On the desolate land, countless living beings were slowly moving, seemingly forced labor carrying something.</p><p></p><p>Near the living beings, there were hundreds of pitch-black monsters with horns on their heads and wings on their backs, slowly flapping their wings and hovering there.</p><p></p><p>These monsters were dozens of meters tall, exceptionally burly, with oozing pus, fierce faces, fangs, and sharp limbs like blades.</p><p></p><p>They stared unblinkingly at the many living beings, who were like slaves.</p><p></p><p>Here is the full English translation of the Chinese excerpt:</p><p></p><p>Under the intimidating gaze of their eyes, the living beings lowered their heads, not daring to make eye contact.</p><p></p><p>"Hehe, Jack, we've been in this void for so long, when will we be able to go back?" </p><p></p><p>"Nicole, you ask me, but I don't know either. We are just the most ordinary Saint Demon soldiers of the Devouring Void Saint Demons."</p><p></p><p>"Then what exactly are the Saint Demon Gods here for? They make us bite and tear at the Creation Pillars every day, my demonic claws are almost blunted."</p><p></p><p>Nicole stuck out her disgusting long tongue, licking her own claws, troubled.</p><p></p><p>Their voices were like a saw cutting through iron, extremely grating and unpleasant to the ears.</p><p></p><p>Jack narrowed his eyes and said in a deep voice, "This void is the largest void we Devouring Void Saint Demons have ever encountered, and it is also of the highest civilization level!"</p><p></p><p>Nicole bared her fangs and asked curiously, "Then the Saint Demon Gods shouldn't be here to occupy it, otherwise this void would have long been taken over by our Devouring Void Saint Demon clan."</p><p></p><p>"Yes, I heard Lord Cynthia say that the eight Creation Pillars contain indescribable terrifying power, and the Saint Demon God Lords want to absorb the energy from the Creation Pillars to further strengthen their power." Jack's eyes were filled with reverence.</p><p></p><p>The Saint Demon Gods, they are the supreme Saint Demons of our Devouring Void Saint Demon clan!</p><p></p><p>And these supreme Saint Demons, there are a total of eight, the eight great Saint Demon Gods, distributed among the eight Creation Pillars.</p><p></p><p>The hierarchy of the Devouring Void Saint Demon clan is simple to remember: Saint Demon Soldiers (one pair of wings), Saint Demon Generals (two pairs), Saint Demon Kings (three pairs), Saint Demon Emperors (four pairs), Saint Demon Lords (five pairs), Saint Demon Overlords (six pairs), Saint Demon Gods (seven pairs).</p><p></p><p>Nicole suddenly realized, indicating that she understood. She suddenly caught sight of a living being slacking off, and her gaze immediately turned fierce as she swung a claw at it from a distance!</p><p></p><p>"Daring to slack off?!"</p><p></p><p>Swoosh--!</p><p></p><p>That living being was instantly sliced into eight pieces!</p><p></p><p>Seeing this, the living beings turned deathly pale with anguish and bitterness in their hearts. Their previous world was so beautiful. </p><p></p><p>But with the arrival of these terrifying monsters, countless deaths have occurred, and the remaining have become slaves, turning into their current state.</p><p></p><p>They are like fish on a cutting board, and these Devouring Void Saint Demons are the knives hanging over their heads!</p><p></p><p>"You lowly crawling insects, you'd better not slack off! If you dare slack off again, my demonic claws are so hungry, hehe!"</p><p></p><p>Nicole licked her demonic claws, grinning wickedly.</p><p></p><p>The living beings trembled in fear, filled with despair.</p><p></p><p>It's not that they don't want to fight, they simply can't win!</p><p></p><p>Nicole was slightly satisfied with the sight, then shouted to the other Saint Demon Soldiers around, "You all don't slack off either, keep a close watch!"</p><p></p><p>The group of Saint Demon Soldiers hurriedly responded, "Yes, Captain Nicole!"</p><p></p><p>Just then!</p><p></p><p>The space was suddenly torn open, attracting everyone's gaze!</p><p></p><p>Nicole and Jack exchanged a glance, frowning as they looked towards the spatial rift, their bloodred eyes slightly narrowed.</p><p></p><p>A group of people walked out from the spatial rift, led by a young man.</p><p></p><p>The Saint Demon Soldiers flapped their wings and rushed to surround the group, murderous intent filling the air!</p><p></p><p>The living beings snapped back to their senses, their expressions turning bitter. They didn't know where these people came from, but they knew that encountering the Devouring Void Saint Demons meant the end for them.</p><p></p><p>However, they were unable to do anything, as their lives were in the hands of the Devouring Void Saint Demons.</p><p></p><p>Old Turtle, Hunxing, and the others swept their gaze over the slave-like living beings, their expressions changing slightly. When their vision landed on the Saint Demon Soldiers, their brows furrowed deeply.</p><p></p><p>Are these the so-called monsters?</p><p></p><p>On these monsters, they couldn't sense any aura at all!</p><p></p><p>It was difficult to perceive their strength.</p><p></p><p>"You crawling insects... From which star system did you come from?"</p><p></p><p>Nicole flapped her wings and slowly approached the young man in blue, grinning ominously.</p><p></p><p>Suddenly, the young man in blue didn't say a word, and simply slapped out lightly.</p><p></p><p>"Boom--!"</p><p></p><p>Nicole's expression changed abruptly, and she instantly exploded into a mist of blood!</p><p></p><p>"......"</p><p></p><p>Deathly silence fell over the entire scene!</p><p></p><p>Whether it was the group of living beings or the Saint Demon Soldiers like Jack, they were all stunned in place.</p><p></p><p>Luchengsheng's eyes looked at Jack, and he said indifferently, "I don't have time to waste words with you maggots. Bring out your leader."</p>

        <h1>Chapter 146</h1>
        <div class="content">
            <p>Here is the full English translation of the Chinese excerpt:</p><p></p><p>Unbelievable!</p><p></p><p>Two disciples have followed the Immortal Emperor Changsheng!</p><p></p><p>The people's gazes towards Ancient Crane Forest became increasingly cautious.</p><p></p><p>Regarding this, Ancient Crane Forest sighed slightly, knowing that this was all because of the Master's doing.</p><p></p><p>A person, even with the slightest connection to Immortal Emperor Changsheng, would likely be able to walk arrogantly in the Immortal Realm.</p><p></p><p>Of course, Ancient Crane Forest was not the kind of person to bully others with his power.</p><p></p><p>He patted Chen Dadao and then looked at the Sect Master of the White Moon Sect, bowing and asking, "Sect Master, should my disciple Dadao be able to become an inner disciple?"</p><p></p><p>"No!" </p><p></p><p>The Sect Master of the White Moon Sect's expression changed slightly as he refused.</p><p></p><p>He then said, "Craneforest, making your disciple an inner disciple would be wasting his talents. In our sect's view, he should directly be promoted to become a core disciple!"</p><p></p><p>The crowd all nodded and smiled, agreeing.</p><p></p><p>Ancient Crane Forest was stunned.</p><p></p><p>Core disciple, that was already the highest level of White Moon Sect disciples...</p><p></p><p>He had struggled for over a thousand years, and was only now a true disciple...</p><p></p><p>Yet this little Chen Dadao had surpassed him?</p><p></p><p>Moreover, Chen Dadao was a newcomer, suddenly becoming a core disciple, he would surely become the target of many. This might not be good for him.</p><p></p><p>Seeming to know what Ancient Crane Forest was thinking, the Sect Master hurriedly said sternly, "Craneforest, don't worry, this Sect Master knows what you're thinking. Today, even the Patriarch is here, and the Elders are also here. Let's see who dares to have any objections to your disciple becoming a core disciple! Anyone with objections will be expelled from the sect!"</p><p></p><p>After saying this, he tentatively asked, "Craneforest, the sect is currently lacking an Elder. Would you like to take on that role?"</p><p></p><p>The Sect Master was a bit worried, fearing that Ancient Crane Forest might want the position of Sect Master. If he did, he would have to give it to him.</p><p></p><p>Seeing the Sect Master say this, Ancient Crane Forest could only acquiesce, immediately saying, "Since the Sect Master has said so, then let my disciple become a core disciple."</p><p></p><p>Without any resistance, becoming a core disciple was naturally excellent. Not to mention the other privileges, the resources would be greatly tilted in his favor.</p><p></p><p>As for the Elder position...</p><p></p><p>Ancient Crane Forest also nodded in agreement. Although he was not one to fight, he was not stupid. Sometimes borrowing the Master's influence could allow him to live more comfortably.</p><p></p><p>He even felt that if he had proposed to become the Sect Master, the Sect Master, out of deference to the Master's might, might have agreed...</p><p></p><p>"Haha, good!" The Sect Master heaved a sigh of relief, affectionately putting his arm around Ancient Crane Forest's shoulder and laughing, "Craneforest, tomorrow our sect will hold a promotion ceremony for you and your disciple. At that time, let all the influential figures in the Langtian Domain come to observe!"</p><p></p><p>So quickly?</p><p></p><p>Ancient Crane Forest was shocked and asked puzzledly, "Sect Master, my disciple has just arrived. Shouldn't he first mine for three years according to the rules?"</p><p></p><p>The Sect Master: "Rules are dead."</p><p></p><p>The crowd: "Yes, Elder Crane, rules are dead."</p><p></p><p>Ancient Crane Forest: "..."</p><p></p><p>...</p><p></p><p>In the Central Immortal Realm.</p><p></p><p>"We pay our respects to the Immortal Emperor Changsheng!!!"</p><p></p><p>The unified respectful exclamation resounded in the supremely magnificent Immortal Emperor's Palace!</p><p></p><p>In a corner of the palace,</p><p></p><p>Tongxin and Lin Dong were hiding behind a golden pillar, their heads poking out, watching the scene with awe and being completely immersed in it.</p><p></p><p>Before their eyes were hundreds of kneeling figures, each of whose auras were overwhelming, each in the most reverential posture.</p><p></p><p>Above the palace, a figure in azure robes stood tall.</p><p></p><p>It was not Luchang Sheng, but who else could it be.</p><p></p><p>Luchang Sheng looked down upon the many figures, saying indifferently, "Today, this Emperor has only one matter, and that is to abdicate the position of Immortal Emperor of the Central Immortal Realm."</p><p></p><p>As the words fell, all the people in the palace trembled in their kneeling posture, not daring to speak.</p><p></p><p>In the other four Immortal Realms, the people present would have the right to speak and dare to speak. But in the Central Immortal Realm, no one dared!</p><p></p><p>The difference between Immortal Emperors was clear at a glance.</p><p></p><p>Luchang Sheng's supreme majesty was evident.</p><p></p><p>Luchang Sheng finished speaking, and with a wave of his hand, the Immortal Emperor's Decree that had been hanging high in the palace suddenly flew into his hand.</p><p></p><p>The Immortal Emperor's Decree trembled in his hand, as if wanting to express something.</p><p></p><p>Luchang Sheng smiled slightly, "Do you know the purpose of the Immortal Emperor's Decree? It is to assist one Immortal Emperor after another."</p><p></p><p>New 69 Books</p><p></p><p>Here is the full English translation of the Chinese excerpt:</p><p></p><p>At these words, the Immortal Emperor's body trembled slightly, but he only gently rubbed Luchang Sheng's palm and then fell silent.</p><p></p><p>Luchang Sheng nodded slightly and casually wiped his hand.</p><p></p><p>The two characters "Changsheng" on the Immortal Emperor's token suddenly disappeared without a trace.</p><p></p><p><tt_keyword_ad data-title="Games" data-tag="Featured Recommendations" data-type="1" data-value="1913"></tt_keyword_ad></p><p></p><p>He hung the Immortal Emperor's token back on the main hall and said in a loud voice, "As for the selection of the next Immortal Emperor of the Central Immortal Realm, I will not interfere. You all decide for yourselves."</p><p></p><p>After saying this, he stepped down from the hall, walking through the kneeling crowd with his hands behind his back and heading outside.</p><p></p><p>Tongxin and Lin Dong snapped out of their daze, took a deep breath, and hurriedly ran after him.</p><p></p><p>The crowd felt a tightness in their hearts, and many were slightly reluctant, but they quickly kowtowed and shouted in unison, "Farewell, Immortal Emperor Changsheng!"</p><p></p><p>In the waves of this sound, the figures of Luchang Sheng and the two others gradually receded and disappeared from sight.</p><p></p><p>After a moment, the crowd slowly rose.</p><p></p><p>At the forefront, an elderly figure stepped out and looked in the direction Luchang Sheng had left, saying reverently, "The Immortal Emperor has... made way for the next generation."</p><p></p><p>The crowd all sighed in agreement.</p><p></p><p>But the atmosphere soon became tense.</p><p></p><p>The gazes of the crowd began to flicker, repeatedly sizing up the three figures at the forefront.</p><p></p><p>Barring any unexpected events, the new Emperor would be decided among these three great Immortal Lords.</p><p></p><p>"You two, what are you looking at me for? Come, let's fight, and whoever wins will be the new Immortal Emperor."</p><p></p><p>.........</p><p></p><p>In the dark void.</p><p></p><p>Luchang Sheng stood in front with his hands behind his back, while Tongxin and Lin Dong obediently stood behind him.</p><p></p><p>Countless stars rushed past them from the side.</p><p></p><p>Tongxin and Lin Dong were still immersed in the scene in the Immortal Emperor's palace. They couldn't understand how Luchang Sheng could so casually give up the position of Immortal Emperor, without the slightest reluctance.</p><p></p><p>That was the position of Immortal Emperor, after all!</p><p></p><p>They were thinking that if it were them... but they knew they could never become the Immortal Emperor.</p><p></p><p>"When we arrive at the destination, I'll open an inn. You two better not cause any trouble during your daily lives," Luchang Sheng said, looking ahead with a faint smile.</p><p></p><p>Tongxin and Lin Dong stiffened, quickly bowing respectfully, "Master, don't worry! We two will be on our best behavior!"</p><p></p><p>"Hehe." Luchang Sheng chuckled and closed his eyes.</p><p></p><p>Tongxin and Lin Dong exchanged a glance and swallowed, also falling silent.</p><p></p><p>It was good to follow their master, but they felt very constrained, afraid of accidentally upsetting him...</p><p></p><p>.........</p><p></p><p>Time flowed on, never ceasing.</p><p></p><p>In the blink of an eye, another ten years had passed.</p><p></p><p>This was the two thousand and eleventh year since Luchang Sheng had emerged from the Immortal Tomb in the Mortal Realm.</p><p></p><p>The Heavenly Scar, this was the name of a certain realm, a dazzling world.</p><p></p><p>In the boundless azure sky, there was a rift that stretched from an unknown origin to an unknown destination, as it had been since ancient times.</p><p></p><p>No matter when or where, as long as one looked up, they could see the black rift in the sky, which looked as if it had been cleaved by a sword.</p><p></p><p>It was said that if one could no longer see the rift in the sky, it meant they were no longer within the Heavenly Scar realm.</p><p></p><p>However, this was just a legend, for the Heavenly Scar was too vast, and so far, no one had been heard of leaving it.</p><p></p><p>As for whether those powerful figures had left, that was unknown.</p><p></p><p>To the east of the Heavenly Scar, there was a notorious land of chaos, known as the Black Calamity Domain, where countless ruthless and evil people gathered.</p><p></p><p>The name "Black Calamity Domain" struck fear in the hearts of ordinary people.</p><p></p><p>Common folk dared not venture there.</p><p></p><p>Today, in a small town within the Black Calamity Domain, a new inn had opened for business.</p><p></p><p>The inn was not large, even a bit small, but its name was boldly arrogant!</p><p></p><p>It was called... the Longevity Inn?</p>

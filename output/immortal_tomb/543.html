        <h1>Chapter 543</h1>
        <div class="content">
            <p>Here is the full English translation of the Chinese excerpt:</p><p></p><p>Wangsu and the others paused, then turned around to see the gloomy-faced Grand Elder of the Daoyan Sect standing there!</p><p></p><p>Oh?</p><p></p><p>The Daoyan Sect had actually sent out the Grand Elder, Jiang Yanfeng!</p><p></p><p>In that case, Jiang Yanfeng would be the highest-ranking person here!</p><p></p><p>Even Wangsu, who came from the Tianwu Sect, was nothing in comparison, as he was only an outer sect elder, while Jiang Yanfeng was on a completely different level.</p><p></p><p>"Hehe, Elder Jiang," Wangsu immediately cupped his hands in greeting, his attitude much better than when facing the other sect elders before.</p><p></p><p>Apart from Jiang Yanfeng's high status and position, the more important reason was that Wangsu thought that if he could get on good terms with Jiang Yanfeng, it would be much easier to seize the Earth Vein later.</p><p></p><p>"Elder Jiang!"</p><p></p><p>The other sect elders snapped out of their daze and hurriedly paid their respects as well.</p><p></p><p>They were excited in their hearts, as the Daoyan Sect sending out a Grand Elder showed their determination to fight for the Earth Vein! The Daoyan Sect was indeed more formidable than their own sects!</p><p></p><p>"Mm." After looking at Wangsu, Jiang Yanfeng's eyes flickered, then he turned to the crowd and asked in a stern voice, "Have any of you seen my sect's Fifth Elder?"</p><p></p><p>Fifth Elder?</p><p></p><p>The crowd was stunned, shaking their heads blankly.</p><p></p><p>"Elder Jiang, we've just arrived in Jixiang Town and haven't seen your sect's Fifth Elder. What do you mean by that?"</p><p></p><p>Even Wangsu and Song Ren were puzzled, their eyes flashing with uncertainty.</p><p></p><p>Seeing this, Jiang Yanfeng pursed his lips, his heart becoming conflicted and confused.</p><p></p><p>They've all just arrived...</p><p></p><p>Then what happened to their Fifth Elder? </p><p></p><p>Based on this Wangsu, there's no way he could have the strength to kill the Fifth Elder.</p><p></p><p>Could it be... that the Tianwu Sect has colluded with the other sects to target his Daoyan Sect?</p><p></p><p>And they're just putting on an act now?</p><p></p><p>But why? What's the conspiracy behind this?</p><p></p><p>Will they join forces to assassinate him, Jiang Yanfeng, next?</p><p></p><p>Thinking of this, Jiang Yanfeng's heart jumped, suppressing his earth-shattering speculation, and said expressionlessly, "It's nothing. You all carry on, I suddenly remembered something I need to take care of back at the sect, so I'll be leaving first."</p><p></p><p>Saying that, he turned to leave amidst the bewildered expressions of the crowd.</p><p></p><p>Seeing this, the other sect elders hurriedly shouted, "Elder Jiang, you can't leave!!!"</p><p></p><p>Jiang Yanfeng's eyelid twitched violently, gritting his teeth inwardly. It was just as he had guessed!</p><p></p><p>The Tianwu Sect and the other sects had colluded together to target his Daoyan Sect, killing the Fifth Elder, and now they wanted to join hands to kill him as well!</p><p></p><p>No, although he was the strongest, he couldn't take on so many opponents. If they had some hidden trump card, he would be in deep trouble. He had to quickly leave this place and report to the Sect Master!</p><p></p><p>Jiang Yanfeng was anxious, unleashing his full potential, and disappeared in a flash of light.</p><p></p><p>The crowd watched his hasty and panicked retreat, stunned.</p><p></p><p>"Uh, looks like he really had an urgent matter to attend to, even forgetting about the Earth Vein?"</p><p></p><p>The other sect elders shook their heads, unable to figure out what had happened, and could only stare at Wangsu and Song Ren as they entered Jixiang Town.</p><p></p><p>Since the Daoyan Sect had given up, let them give up. As long as they could subdue Wangsu, the others wouldn't dare to come and snatch the Earth Vein back, right?</p><p></p><p>...</p><p></p><p>At the same time, miles away, Jiang Yanfeng looked back and, seeing no one was pursuing him, stopped and took out a communication talisman, panting heavily:</p><p></p><p>"Sect Master! I've arrived in Jixiang Town and found that the Tianwu Sect only sent an outer sect elder, who doesn't have the strength to kill the Fifth Elder! I also discovered that the other sect elders are acting strangely and suspiciously!"</p><p></p><p>"I suspect that the Tianwu Sect has colluded with the other sects to kill our Fifth Elder!!"</p><p></p><p>"Sect Master, what exactly has happened? Why are they targeting our Daoyan Sect?"</p><p></p><p>"Sect Master, our Daoyan Sect is now in a precarious situation, on the verge of disaster! Please think of a solution!"</p><p></p><p>"I won't return to the sect for now, I'll stay here and wait for your instructions."</p><p></p><p>Jiang Yanfeng said all this in one breath, then put away the communication talisman, cautiously looking around before hiding in a secluded spot.</p><p></p><p>...</p><p></p><p>At this time, in the Daoyan Sect's main hall, there was complete silence.</p><p></p><p>Yin Quan had just been in a meeting with the elders, when the communication talisman suddenly started to glow and heat up.</p><p></p><p>After hearing Jiang Yanfeng's words echoing through the hall, everyone was stunned!</p><p></p><p>Including Yin Quan, the Sect Master, who felt a chill run down his spine!</p><p></p><p>What's going on?</p><p></p><p>Here is the full English translation of the Chinese excerpt:</p><p></p><p>"Yier? Not just the Tianwu Sect?</p><p></p><p>The Grand Elder just went out for a trip, and he's already uncovered such a terrifying piece of news!</p><p></p><p>His Daoyan Sect has actually become the public enemy of all the martial sects in the entire Xingluodi Empire?</p><p></p><p>Oh my god, what on earth has happened!</p><p></p><p>Yin Quan's head was in a daze, feeling that something was just not right!</p><p></p><p>But he knew Jiang Yanfeng's character all too well.</p><p></p><p>Rigorous, meticulous, fair and just, hmm, and also skilled in deduction, otherwise he wouldn't have been appointed as the Grand Elder.</p><p></p><p>"Sect Master, while the other sects are still competing for the Earth Vein, let's quickly have our entire Daoyan Sect flee from the Xingluodi Empire!!"</p><p></p><p>"Yes, Sect Master, once the other sects have finished competing for the Earth Vein, they will most likely target our Daoyan Sect next!"</p><p></p><p>"Sect Master, please quickly summon the Grand Elder back, we'll immediately pack up and prepare the disciples of our sect......"</p><p></p><p>The elders' faces were deathly pale, lamenting in grief, truly heartbreaking to hear.</p><p></p><p>The contrast between the before and after was too great, they couldn't psychologically bear it.</p><p></p><p>"Shut up! Our Daoyan Sect has been rooted in the Xingluodi for over a thousand years, how can we easily leave? Until the matter is thoroughly cleared up, none of you are allowed to speak again!"</p><p></p><p>Yin Quan coldly shouted, his eyes narrowing as he disappeared from the main hall.</p><p></p><p>"From now on, the entire sect is on high alert, the order has been given, no disciple is allowed to leave the sect, I'm going to the Beidou Academy!"</p><p></p><p>......</p><p></p><p>Jixiang Town.</p><p></p><p>As soon as Wang Sao and the others entered, they attracted the gaze of the townspeople.</p><p></p><p>Seeing the attire of Wang Sao and the others, as well as their aura that was unlike ordinary people, the townspeople knew they were all martial cultivators!</p><p></p><p>Anyway, they were not literary cultivators, whose temperament was definitely not as domineering as this!</p><p></p><p>"Eh? Isn't that Steward Song from the Tianwu Sect?"</p><p></p><p>"Yes, it's Steward Song!"</p><p></p><p>"......"</p><p></p><p>The townspeople soon discovered Steward Song among the group, exclaiming in surprise.</p><p></p><p>At this moment, Steward Song was lowering his head, following along.</p><p></p><p>The townspeople reacted quickly, suddenly feeling a great sense of alarm!</p><p></p><p>Just by looking, they could tell that this was a high-ranking member of the Tianwu Sect, at least an elder-level figure!</p><p></p><p>Otherwise, how could Steward Song be behaving in such a manner?</p><p></p><p>The townspeople quickly focused on the leading Wang Sao, and immediately sucked in a cold breath, hastily bowing and greeting him, feeling terrified!</p><p></p><p>At the same time, they were puzzled, not knowing why they had come to their small town. But soon, the townspeople thought of Han Yue and Ye Xiaoxiao!</p><p></p><p>Could it be because of the Earth Vein?!</p><p></p><p>Apart from that, there was no other explanation.</p><p></p><p>Sure enough, the next moment, Wang Sao asked first:</p><p></p><p>"Where are Han Yue and Ye Xiaoxiao?"</p><p></p><p>On the way here, Steward Song had already told him the names of the two children with the Earth Vein.</p><p></p><p>The townspeople were taken aback, quickly shaking their heads to indicate that they didn't know.</p><p></p><p>Concerning Mr. Lu, they couldn't and dared not say anything...</p><p></p><p>Caught between Mr. Lu and the mighty Tianwu Sect, it was too difficult.</p><p></p><p>Seeing this, Wang Sao's brows furrowed, just about to say something harshly, when the Town Master Cao Yulong hurried over, coming to the townspeople's rescue:</p><p></p><p>"G-Greetings, esteemed guests from the Tianwu Sect, I am the Town Master of this town, if you have any questions, you can ask me!"</p><p></p><p>Wang Sao's brows twitched, looking down from above and asking, "Then tell me, where are Han Yue and Ye Xiaoxiao?"</p><p></p><p>Cao Yulong's expression stiffened, his lips moving as if wanting to say something but hesitating.</p><p></p><p>He knew that if he said it, then Yueer would truly have no chance with the Changsheng Academy.</p><p></p><p>"I know where they are, do you want me to lead the way for you?"</p><p></p><p>At this time, an old man came over, smiling faintly.</p><p></p><p>Cao Yulong's heart suddenly felt relieved, but then he looked at the old man with concern.</p><p></p><p>Wang Sao and the others' expressions eased up, immediately gesturing for the old man to lead the way.</p><p></p><p>At the same time, they scrutinized the old man, seeing that he was just an ordinary person, their hearts slightly relaxed, but then they became dissatisfied again.</p><p></p><p>An ordinary person, facing them, actually not being servile or arrogant?</p><p></p><p>His courage wasn't bad! Seems like he's lived a full life.</p><p></p><p>As for the townspeople, they were stunned.</p><p></p><p>Old, Old Xu? Didn't they hear this morning that he was still sick? And now in the afternoon, he's already recovered?</p><p></p><p>Also, what does Old Xu mean by this?</p><p></p><p>Mr. Lu has been taking care of his noodle shop the most, and now he's stabbing him in the back, is that it?</p><p></p><p>Xiu Qianchen smiled benevolently, then turned and walked away.</p><p></p><p>"Follow me."</p>

        <h1>Chapter 379</h1>
        <div class="content">
            <p>Here is the full English translation of the Chinese excerpt:</p><p></p><p>"A thousand years, as long as you protect our human race for a thousand years. ·É¶(¬Ø`‚óï‚Äø‚óï¬¥¬Ø) ‚ô´ ‚ô™ ‚ô´ 6‚ìø9ùìàƒ§·ªÆ‚ìç.cùï†ùìú ‚ô´ ‚ô™ ‚ô´ (¬Ø`‚óï‚Äø‚óï¬¥¬Ø)·É¶"</p><p></p><p>Jian Wuhui looked up at Shenlo and the others.</p><p></p><p>A thousand years?? </p><p></p><p>It's not too long.</p><p></p><p>Except for the Heavenly God Clan, the rest of the top ten peak great clans' powerhouses nodded silently, just about to raise their hands to take the Heavenly Dao oath when...</p><p></p><p>"Hold on, everyone."</p><p></p><p>The long silent Shenlo spoke up, interrupting the crowd's oath-taking.</p><p></p><p>Huh?</p><p></p><p>Jian Wuhui and the others' eyes suddenly sharpened, a bad premonition arising in their hearts.</p><p></p><p>The myriad tribes who were originally as if mourning the dead saw this and their faces lit up slightly, their thoughts becoming more active.</p><p></p><p>The Heavenly God Clan's divine child spoke, could this matter still have a turning point?</p><p></p><p>"Shenlo, what are you trying to do? Don't tell me you're still not satisfied? Your Heavenly God Clan has obtained the most Luli Hearts after all!"</p><p></p><p>Bi Qiong frowned as he looked at Shenlo.</p><p></p><p>Ao Xing and the others also looked at Shenlo with puzzlement, not knowing what he meant.</p><p></p><p>But Shenlo ignored them, and instead looked at Jian Wuhui, indifferently saying, "Jian Wuhui."</p><p></p><p>Jian Wuhui cupped his hands: "Divine Child, please speak."</p><p></p><p>He had a feeling that the Heavenly God Clan was deliberately targeting the human race.</p><p></p><p>Shenlo's eyes were sharp like a falcon's, staring straight at him, coldly saying:</p><p></p><p>"From the moment you appeared, you have been dominating the situation, and everyone has been led by the nose because of the importance of the Luli Hearts..."</p><p></p><p>Jian Wuhui's gaze slightly changed.</p><p></p><p>Shenlo's eyes narrowed, continuing to say, "This divine child has only one question to ask, the Luli Hearts... are there really only ten thousand of them?"</p><p></p><p>Hearing this, all the tribes present were shocked!</p><p></p><p>Indeed, from the beginning, Jian Wuhui had said there were ten thousand Luli Hearts, which was more than in previous sessions, and they had unconsciously not doubted it.</p><p></p><p>But...</p><p></p><p>At this moment, Jiang Wuxin and the others' hearts were pounding, finally reaching the most tense step.</p><p></p><p>Fortunately, their memories of the true number of Luli Hearts had been erased.</p><p></p><p>Jian Wuhui did not hesitate, and asked in return, "Divine Child, why do you say this? Our human race is facing such a great calamity, and we can still lie? Moreover, the ten thousand Luli Hearts this session still cannot satisfy your appetite, do you want us to continue to produce more Luli Hearts?"</p><p></p><p>Shenlo chuckled, "You want the top ten peak great clans to take the Heavenly Dao oath to protect the human race for a thousand years... a thousand years is indeed enough time to refine the Luli Hearts..."</p><p></p><p>Jian Wuhui's gaze became slightly tense as he stared deeply at Shenlo.</p><p></p><p>At this moment, the myriad tribes did not speak a word, silently listening to the two's conversation, not daring to miss a single word.</p><p></p><p>Jian Wuhui's tone became cold, "Divine Child Shenlo, no matter how you think, the fact is that there are a total of ten thousand Luli Hearts, and our human race cannot produce more!"</p><p></p><p>"Your Heavenly God Clan is powerful, you can accuse us of anything you want."</p><p></p><p>"But our human race has already reached the end of the road, at most the fish will die and the net will break, and no one will want the Luli Hearts anymore."</p><p></p><p>Jian Wuhui tried to make them feel anxious again.</p><p></p><p>Hearing this, Bi Qiong and the others' faces indeed became anxious, but Shenlo coldly sneered:</p><p></p><p>"Whether there is a lie or not is simple, a soul search will know!"</p><p></p><p>The myriad tribes present all looked forward to the show.</p><p></p><p>Although everyone felt that the human race had reached this point, there was no need to lie.</p><p></p><p>But who wouldn't want to verify it, after all, the soul search wasn't on them.</p><p></p><p>Jian Wuhui took a light breath, suddenly Jiang Wuxin's voice transmission sounded: "Oh no, Lord Jian, I remember that there is also information about the Eternal Life Entity in our memories, we five cannot be soul searched."</p><p></p><p>Jian Wuhui's gaze flashed, looking at Shenlo, and said, "Go ahead and do the soul search."</p><p></p><p>After saying that, he turned his head and asked, "Which of our human race's Shenxuan and above are willing?"</p><p></p><p>The next moment, Fang Hui and other Shenxuan realm experts, including three Shenyou, stood up neatly, indicating that they were all willing to accept the soul search.</p><p></p><p>Of course, if they didn't want to, they couldn't. They all knew clearly in their hearts that as long as there was a legitimate reason, the Heavenly God Clan could crush them, the human race, like playing with toys.</p><p></p><p>"Good!"</p><p></p><p>Jian Wuhui slightly...</p><p></p><p>Here is the full English translation of the Chinese excerpt:</p><p></p><p>He nodded, then looked at Shenlo: "All the elites of our human race are willing to accept soul searching, so the Divine Son may choose one."</p><p></p><p>Shenwei glanced at Shenlo, about to step forward, but heard Shenlo say:</p><p></p><p>"Uncle Wei, wait a moment."</p><p></p><p>Shenwei's body paused, looking at Shenlo with a slightly puzzled gaze.</p><p></p><p>Ao Xing and Bi Qiong were also puzzled, not understanding what Shenlo was up to.</p><p></p><p>Shenlo looked at Jian Wumei and said inexplicably: "Jian Wumei, if you want to search souls, naturally it should be the souls of the five human race masters. What's the point of searching them?"</p><p></p><p>The entire venue fell silent.</p><p></p><p>As the number one clan of the myriad races, Bi Qiong, Ao Xing and the others did not know what to say.</p><p></p><p>What?!</p><p></p><p>Fang Yin and the others' faces turned gloomy, their heads lowered as they stared fixedly at the empty space, their bodies even trembling uncontrollably.</p><p></p><p>Although their hearts were filled with raging anger, they dared not direct that murderous gaze towards Shenlo.</p><p></p><p>The peak-level clans were like a towering mountain, pressing down on them until they could hardly breathe.</p><p></p><p>Jian Wumei and the others' eyes changed slightly, their hearts becoming bitter!</p><p></p><p>The Immortal Sovereign Body...</p><p></p><p>Bao Tian suddenly transmitted a message to Jian Wumei and the others, "You can let Yan Jueyi accept the soul search, he still doesn't know about the Immortal Sovereign Body. That day when he asked me about Lu Changsheng, I didn't tell him."</p><p></p><p>Jian Wumei and the others' eyes lit up.</p><p></p><p>Jian Wumei immediately transmitted a message: "Bludgeon Saint, you go!"</p><p></p><p>Yan Jueyi was slightly startled, then under the gaze of all, he stepped forward, coming to a stop in front of Shenwei, closing his eyes and saying:</p><p></p><p>"Come."</p><p></p><p>Shen looked at Shenlo.</p><p></p><p>Although he was the Third Divine Official, with high status and authority, and Shenlo even addressed him as "Uncle Wei", but out here, he would definitely have to give face to Shenlo and act according to his wishes.</p><p></p><p>After all, Shenlo was the Holy Son of the Heavenly God Clan, and his father was the Heavenly God Master.</p><p></p><p>Shenlo looked at the expressionless Yan Jueyi, a cold light appearing in his eyes, and transmitted: "Uncle Wei, don't hold back when searching the soul, it's best to directly destroy his sea of consciousness."</p><p></p><p>Shenwei hesitated, a bit uncertain. With so many powerful figures from the myriad races watching... If he did that, it would be a bit embarrassing and would make the Heavenly God Clan lose face.</p><p></p><p>Seeing this, Shenlo transmitted: "Hehe, Uncle Wei, don't worry. They're just the human race, even if you say it was an accident, so what?"</p><p></p><p>"Mm."</p><p></p><p>Shenwei nodded imperceptibly, then was about to extend his index finger to point at Yan Jueyi's forehead...</p><p></p><p>Watching that finger slowly approaching Yan Jueyi's forehead, Jian Wumei and the others couldn't help but feel an ominous premonition!</p><p></p><p>Just as Shenwei's index finger was about to touch Yan Jueyi's forehead,</p><p></p><p>A figure in blue robes appeared slowly like a ghost at Yan Jueyi's side, extending his hand and lightly pinching Shenwei's finger with his middle and index fingers.</p><p></p><p>The atmosphere outside the human race's territory suddenly froze!</p><p></p><p>Lu Nan?!</p><p></p><p>Whether it was Shenlo, Ao Xing and the others, or Zi Xuanyong, Xue Yue and the others, or Jian Wumei and the others, they were all stunned, staring at the man in blue robes.</p><p></p><p>Wasn't he still inside the Seven-Colored Glazed Pagoda?</p><p></p><p>Shenwei was also startled by this sudden turn of events. He now wanted to withdraw his index finger, but found that it was firmly gripped by a powerful force and he could not break free!</p><p></p><p>Yan Jueyi sensed the anomaly and opened his eyes, seeing the man in blue at his side, momentarily dumbfounded.</p><p></p><p>Lu Changsheng's gaze also calmly looked at Yan Jueyi, and his calm words finally resounded in the ears of the powerful figures:</p><p></p><p>"Why bother with such trouble? I'll just say it directly - the Glazed Heart has a total of 16,666 pieces..."</p><p></p><p>As he said this, the two fingers of Lu Changsheng that were pinching Shenwei's finger suddenly exerted a light force, accompanied by a 'crack', and Shenwei's entire index finger was snapped!</p><p></p><p>Shenwei cried out in pain, his face changing drastically, and he immediately retreated backwards!</p><p></p><p>Lu Changsheng's expression remained impassive, and as he released his fingers, Shenwei's severed index finger fell from the sky, disappearing into the haze of battle.</p><p></p><p>The powerful figures of the myriad races stared dumbfoundedly at this scene, the successive shocks too sudden for them to recover.</p><p></p><p>Outside the human race's territory, a brief silence fell, everyone stunned on the spot.</p><p></p><p>At this moment, Lu Changsheng finally turned his head, his gaze sweeping over the shocked myriad races, and continued speaking towards Shenlo and the others...</p>

        <h1>Chapter 195</h1>
        <div class="content">
            <p>Here is the full English translation of the Chinese excerpt:</p><p></p><p>Upon hearing this,</p><p></p><p>Peng Fang hurriedly spoke in a respectful tone: "Patriarch, please speak."</p><p></p><p>Lu Changsheng nodded slightly and said, "The Linglang Heavens' Myriad Sect Grand Competition, which is held once every ten thousand years, is about to begin."</p><p></p><p>Peng Fang was stunned for a moment. Although he was new to the Linglang Heavens and had never heard of the Myriad Sect Grand Competition before, he had unwavering faith in Lu Changsheng's words. He then asked, "Patriarch, do you mean..."</p><p></p><p>"This sect competition is only open to sects of rank nine and above. You should go and get our sect a rank," Lu Changsheng said.</p><p></p><p>"Yes." Peng Fang's eyes lit up, and he then smiled and said, "Patriarch, then I shall take my leave."</p><p></p><p>Seeing Lu Changsheng nod, Peng Fang bowed and left the rear mountain.</p><p></p><p>Lu Changsheng poured himself a cup of wine and looked at the flying cranes outside the mountain, his expression calm and his mood as tranquil as a deep well.</p><p></p><p>This Myriad Sect Grand Competition was just the beginning. When the time comes, he can ferret out those who had once plotted against him in the Linglang Heavens.</p><p></p><p>He knew that among the nine rank-one sects in the Three Domains of Heaven, Earth, and Man, there should be some who had participated.</p><p></p><p>Not to mention many, as long as he can expose even one, the others will naturally be revealed as well.</p><p></p><p>At that time, none of them will be able to escape.</p><p></p><p>And at this moment... those in the Linglang Heavens who had once participated against him don't even know that Lu Changsheng has already come to the Linglang Heavens and established a sect...</p><p></p><p>If they were to find out, they would probably be so shocked that they would pack up and flee.</p><p></p><p>This was also the reason why Cai Xu and Huang Bin were so startled when they asked about the patriarch's name.</p><p></p><p>Because on the first day of establishing the sect, Lu Changsheng had instructed Peng Fang to tell everyone not to reveal his name.</p><p></p><p>During the Heavenly Scar incident, Lu Changsheng had made a slight miscalculation.</p><p></p><p>He had thought that those people would come to assassinate him upon hearing his name... Fortunately, Xing Tian appeared in time and informed him about the Jiang Imperial Clan, the Zhan Imperial Clan, and that Ancestral Beast.</p><p></p><p>The main reason was that Lu Changsheng had overestimated, thinking that some of the mysterious people would be hiding in the Heavenly Scar, when in fact, it was only the likes of the Jiang Imperial Clan.</p><p></p><p>Furthermore, this Myriad Sect Grand Competition would be a good opportunity for the disciples of the Carefree Sect to hone their skills.</p><p></p><p>Although there were some reasons behind the establishment of the sect, the main reason was still out of ambition. Now that it has been established, he should take care of it, as he should.</p><p></p><p>...</p><p></p><p>In the southern region of Canglang Zhou, the Carefree Sect has completely risen to prominence, even surpassing the three major sects.</p><p></p><p>Unavoidable, as their outrageous treatment and extremely high recruitment standards are too shocking.</p><p></p><p>Moreover, there is another piece of news that has added fuel to the fire:</p><p></p><p>The two grand elders of the Blood Flame Sect and the Shenluomen have gone to the Carefree Sect together, only to be ignored by the Carefree Sect, and they even had to swallow their pride and leave on the spot.</p><p></p><p>Who would believe this if it were told?</p><p></p><p>But the problem is, this is something that countless cultivators have witnessed with their own eyes.</p><p></p><p>Blood Flame Pavilion.</p><p></p><p>Bang!</p><p></p><p>Fan Hong smashed another table, his face turning ashen.</p><p></p><p>The Grand Elder Chen He and the other elders below were trembling with fear, daring not to speak.</p><p></p><p>They didn't even know how many tables the pavilion master had already broken.</p><p></p><p>"Do you know how many people are now discussing our Blood Flame Pavilion outside?" Fan Hong growled. "We've completely lost face!"</p><p></p><p>The elders lowered their heads. How would they know how many people there were? The pavilion master was being unreasonable.</p><p></p><p>"Grand Elder, this time you have greatly disappointed me," Fan Hong stared at Chen He sternly.</p><p></p><p>Chen He pursed his lips and said innocently, "Pavilion Master, wasn't it you who said that if the other party truly had the strength, we should come back and plan it out carefully?"</p><p></p><p>Here is the full English translation of the excerpt from the Chinese novel:</p><p></p><p>Fan Hong furrowed his brows, but before he could speak, Chen He continued, "Patriarch, you don't know this, but when I was at the Carefree Sect, just a single glance from that old examiner made me and Elder Zheng Zhanglang of the Shenluomen tremble in fear! That old examiner is most likely the Patriarch of the Carefree Sect, and he should be a Great Celestial Immortal, Patriarch!"</p><p></p><p>What? The Patriarch of the Carefree Sect, a Great Celestial Immortal?!</p><p></p><p>Fan Hong was slightly shocked in his heart. </p><p></p><p>It was audacious of the Carefree Sect to choose the same day as the three major sects to recruit disciples. It turns out their Patriarch is also a Great Celestial Immortal!</p><p></p><p>It seems they just haven't applied for their sect's ranking yet.</p><p></p><p>In the southern part of the Canglan Continent, it was originally divided among the Blood Flame Monastery, the Shenluomen, and the Nihong Pavilion. But now, the Carefree Sect has suddenly emerged... </p><p></p><p>And they are so overbearing, establishing a foothold here without even greeting the three major sects.</p><p></p><p>Could he just watch the Carefree Sect rise up like this?</p><p></p><p>Absolutely not!</p><p></p><p>Although a Great Celestial Immortal is not easy to deal with, and I don't know their exact rank, but if the three sects unite and exert pressure, they should be able to drive them out of the southern Canglan Continent.</p><p></p><p>Thinking this, Fan Hong waved his hand, and a talisman immediately burst into flames.</p><p></p><p>Soon, a male voice and a female voice rang out:</p><p></p><p>"Patriarch Fan, have you considered the matter of the Myriad Sect Competition after receiving the notice from above?"</p><p></p><p>"Patriarch Fan, if you have no other matters, our Pavilion Master here still has things to attend to."</p><p></p><p>The Myriad Sect Competition? The elders' eyes narrowed.</p><p></p><p>Fan Hong was stunned, momentarily forgetting about the Carefree Sect.</p><p></p><p>He exclaimed in bewilderment, "The Myriad Sect Competition? You've received the notice from above? I haven't received anything here!"</p><p></p><p>"Huh, your Blood Flame Monastery hasn't received it? Then why did you contact our Sect Master and the Nihong Pavilion Master?" the Shenluomen Patriarch asked.</p><p></p><p>Fan Hong took a deep breath and said, "It's all because of that suddenly appearing Carefree Sect. I wanted to call you all together to drive them out. The southern Canglan Continent doesn't have enough resources for four ninth-rank sects to share."</p><p></p><p>To his surprise, the Shenluomen Patriarch fell silent, and the Nihong Pavilion Master didn't say a word either.</p><p></p><p>After a moment, the Shenluomen Patriarch finally spoke, "Patriarch Fan, let's leave the Carefree Sect alone for now. The Myriad Sect Competition is the most important matter at hand. If we're lucky, the three of us might be able to raise our rankings among the ninth-rank sects."</p><p></p><p>Hearing this, Fan Hong was not surprised. The Myriad Sect Competition was indeed the most crucial matter. He sighed helplessly and said, "The Carefree Sect is indeed fortunate that the once-in-ten-thousand-year Myriad Sect Competition has begun. Otherwise, if we weren't occupied, we would have definitely driven them out!"</p><p></p><p>"Haha, Patriarch Fan, then let's leave it at that. I'll start preparing for the Myriad Sect Competition matters. We'll see each other another day."</p><p></p><p>"Until next time."</p><p></p><p>...</p><p></p><p>"Hmph, the Carefree Sect is really lucky," Fan Hong muttered unhappily, then frowned and said, "It's really strange, how come the Shenluomen and the Nihong Pavilion have received the notice from above, but we at the Blood Flame Monastery haven't?"</p><p></p><p>The elders shook their heads one after another, indicating they didn't know.</p><p></p><p>"Could it be that they've forgotten about us?" Fan Hong said gloomily.</p><p></p><p>If they were truly forgotten, it would be understandable, after all, there are many ninth-rank sects in the Linglong Heavens.</p><p></p><p>"Elder, gather all the disciples to the training field. This Patriarch has something to say!"</p><p></p><p>Immediately, Fan Hong waved his hand.</p><p></p><p>"Yes." Chen He heard the order and went to gather everyone.</p><p></p><p>"Hehe, this time, the Blood Flame Monastery will definitely be able to raise its ranking among all the ninth-rank sects in the Human Realm."</p>

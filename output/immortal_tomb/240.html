        <h1>Chapter 240</h1>
        <div class="content">
            <p>Here is the full English translation of the excerpt from the Chinese novel:</p><p></p><p>"Get up," he said. "The new 69 book is here → 69shu.com."</p><p></p><p>Hearing this, Yuanyang Qiu was delighted and quickly got up, standing with a slightly awkward posture.</p><p></p><p>Lu Changsheng smiled and said, "No need to be so formal. This is a medical clinic, so naturally it is a place for people to seek treatment. If you are ill, then sit down and have some tea and we can discuss it. If you are in good health, then you may leave quickly."</p><p></p><p>Seeing the senior in green robes smile so warmly and not seem false, Yuanyang Qiu's heart was somewhat eased.</p><p></p><p>He realized that as long as he didn't provoke this senior, the senior would actually be very kind to him.</p><p></p><p>Thinking this, Yuanyang Qiu took a deep breath, hesitated for a moment, then mustered his courage and sat down across from Lu Changsheng, respectfully saying, "Senior... Senior..."</p><p></p><p>Lu Changsheng furrowed his brow slightly.</p><p></p><p>Yuanyang Qiu was startled, then quickly corrected himself, trying his best to appear calm as he asked, "Doctor, can you please take a look at me?"</p><p></p><p>While feeling apprehensive, his eyes held a glimmer of hope.</p><p></p><p>Coincidentally, he and several elders had entered a dangerous place in the past, and they had contracted some strange ailment there. Though it was not life-threatening, it would often disrupt their cultivation, causing it to be difficult to focus.</p><p></p><p>This strangeness was like a wisp of mist, hidden somewhere within his body, and it was hard to even locate, let alone expel. </p><p></p><p>What troubled him the most was that ever since he was afflicted, he felt his spiritual essence had diminished significantly.</p><p></p><p>Cultivators, in fact, are not much different from ordinary people - they too can have various illnesses. The only difference is the types of ailments they may suffer from.</p><p></p><p>"Of course," Lu Changsheng nodded slightly.</p><p></p><p>Yuanyang Qiu was immediately excited, and promptly described his condition to Lu Changsheng.</p><p></p><p>"Open your mouth," Lu Changsheng said calmly.</p><p></p><p>Yuanyang Qiu quickly opened his mouth, and to his surprise, Lu Changsheng casually waved his hand, causing a wisp of black mist to emerge from Yuanyang Qiu's mouth, hovering in front of him.</p><p></p><p>Seeing this small black mist, Yuanyang Qiu was both delighted and astonished! </p><p></p><p>It had been found so quickly! </p><p></p><p>Why was he unable to locate it himself?</p><p></p><p>Before Yuanyang Qiu could say anything, Lu Changsheng, as if knowing what he wanted to ask, said, "It was hidden within your bone marrow. Since you are not a body cultivator, it is naturally difficult for you to detect."</p><p></p><p>Yuanyang Qiu suddenly understood, looking at the black mist in disbelief. No wonder he couldn't find it - it was hidden in his bone marrow.</p><p></p><p>"Doctor, what is this exactly?" Yuanyang Qiu asked puzzledly.</p><p></p><p>Lu Changsheng glanced at him and smiled, "It's a kind of essence-devouring poison. The longer it remains hidden in your body, the more it will drain your spiritual essence. Eventually, it will become extremely difficult for you to make any progress in your cultivation."</p><p></p><p>Yuanyang Qiu sharply inhaled, staring at the black mist in shock.</p><p></p><p>So it was this thing that was causing his spiritual essence to disappear day by day.</p><p></p><p>He quickly stood up and bowed again, "Thank you, Senior... I mean, Doctor!"</p><p></p><p>Lu Changsheng gently dispersed the black mist, saying, "No need to thank me. The treatment fee is one thousand colored spirit stones."</p><p></p><p>Just then, the young servant who had just finished his tasks in the back garden came in, and upon hearing the price, was stunned. This... This was so expensive?</p><p></p><p>He quickly glanced at Yuanyang Qiu, realizing that he must be a cultivator. The master had said that the price for commoners and cultivators would be different.</p><p></p><p>"Ah?" </p><p></p><p>Even Yuanyang Qiu, the sect leader of the Yang'en Sect, was taken aback for a moment.</p><p></p><p>One thousand colored spirit stones was indeed a sizable sum... He doubted he had that much on him.</p><p></p><p>But setting aside the resolution of this harmful essence-devouring poison, even that peerless precious tea would cost far less than this.</p><p></p><p>Here is the full English translation of the Chinese excerpt:</p><p></p><p>"It's far more than just a thousand colored spirit stones!!"</p><p></p><p>The new 69th book bar 99sɥnx˙ɔoɯ</p><p></p><p>The senior really is the conscience of the industry.</p><p></p><p>Immediately, Yuan Yang Qiu rummaged through his personal space for a long time, and dug out nine hundred and ninety-nine, but the last one was just nowhere to be found......</p><p></p><p>"Doctor, this...can it be offset with something else?" Yuan Yang Qiu said embarrassedly.</p><p></p><p>"No, there's still one left, so consider it as what you owe." Lu Changsheng summoned Tong Xin and had him collect all the colored spirit stones on the table.</p><p></p><p>"Thank you, thank you doctor, then Yang Qiu will take his leave...wait until Yang Qiu has that bastard tied up in front of you."</p><p></p><p>Yuan Yang Qiu glanced at the tea on the table, swallowed, bowed in courtesy, and prepared to leave.</p><p></p><p>Seeing that Lu Changsheng didn't speak anymore, Yuan Yang Qiu didn't dare to stay any longer, and left the clinic with a bowed body.</p><p></p><p>The clinic became quiet again.</p><p></p><p>Lu Changsheng drank tea and read books, Tong Xin pretended to clean up, and Xiao Tong was learning medical theory behind the counter.</p><p></p><p>.........</p><p></p><p>"Phew!!"</p><p></p><p>In the sky outside Yanwu Town, Yuan Yang Qiu suddenly exhaled a deep breath, his gaze fixed on the Changsheng Clinic in the southwest of the town.</p><p></p><p>This time, he almost got ruined by that bitch Su Lianyi. He really walked through the gates of hell.</p><p></p><p>However, it also turned out to be a blessing in disguise.</p><p></p><p>His cultivation has reached the fifth transformation of the Immortal Emperor, and the corrosive poison in his body has also been expelled by the senior. He also saw the true face of that bitch Su Lianyi. All this was just at the cost of a thousand colored spirit stones.</p><p></p><p>It's not that a thousand colored spirit stones are little, but compared to what he gained, it's really too little.</p><p></p><p>More importantly, he has the opportunity to get close to the senior.</p><p></p><p>It's just that...other than bringing Su Lianyi over next time, he can't just come over without reason, right?</p><p></p><p>Oh right! There are a few elders in the sect who are also suffering from the corrosive poison. Next time, he'll bring them over too.</p><p></p><p>As for the thousand colored spirit stones for the treatment fee...let them pay for it themselves. After all, they must have accumulated a lot over the years.</p><p></p><p>He can't afford it anymore, the sect still needs to operate.</p><p></p><p>"Su...Lianyi! Hehe!"</p><p></p><p>Yuan Yang Qiu sneered coldly, looked up at the Changsheng Clinic with reverence, and then turned and stepped into the void, disappearing.</p><p></p><p>.........</p><p></p><p>A few days later.</p><p></p><p>In the Yanguan Sect, Yuan Yang Qiu suppressed his nausea and gently transmitted a message through the jade token:</p><p></p><p>"Lianyi, come to the old place at the hour of the ox tonight, our sect has captured that little girl..."</p><p></p><p>The air was silent for a moment,</p><p></p><p>The jade token flashed, and Su Lianyi's voice sounded: "Let me hear her voice."</p><p></p><p>Yuan Yang Qiu's brow furrowed sharply, his eyes turning cold, but his voice remained gentle: "Hehe, that little girl has been knocked out by our sect..."</p><p></p><p>"Then wake her up."</p><p></p><p>"......"</p><p></p><p>Yuan Yang Qiu's eyelids twitched with anger. He never expected this bitch to be so distrustful!!</p><p></p><p>Wake her up?</p><p></p><p>That little girl was never there in the first place, how could he wake her up?</p><p></p><p>Moreover, he has already become the senior's most loyal disciple, he absolutely wouldn't dare to go against the senior!</p><p></p><p>This Su Lianyi...bitch!!</p><p></p><p>Yuan Yang Qiu lost his patience and directly laid his cards on the table, angrily shouting at the jade token:</p><p></p><p>"Su Lianyi, you bitch, our sect has been too kind to you, haven't we?</p><p></p><p>"The Jade Maiden Mysterious Body is not something a bitch like you can even dream of!"</p><p></p><p>"Our sect will tell you directly, you're doomed!"</p><p></p><p>"Even the Shangqing Palace won't be able to save you! Bitch! Wait for your death!"</p>

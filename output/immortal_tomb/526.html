        <h1>Chapter 526</h1>
        <div class="content">
            <p>Here is the full English translation of the Chinese excerpt:</p><p></p><p>Han Yuebing came rushing over, rubbing the mud off his hands, and greeted respectfully, "Sir!"</p><p></p><p>Han Yue kept a good distance from Lu Changsheng, as he was dirty all over and didn't want to soil Lu Changsheng's clean robe.</p><p></p><p>"Mr. Lu!"</p><p></p><p>At this time, Han Yue's parents also came running over, and the two of them performed a greeting, looking rather reserved and grateful towards Lu Changsheng.</p><p></p><p>The reservation was because they knew the weight and status of the young man in the blue robe before them. The gratitude was because Lu Changsheng had accepted their son Iron Egg, and hadn't even charged much for the tuition.</p><p></p><p>At the same time, they felt quite ashamed, as they knew Lu Changsheng was coming to visit their home, but didn't expect him to arrive so soon.</p><p></p><p>Logically speaking, Lu Sensei should not have been able to visit the other fourteen students in Jixiang Town in just a few days.</p><p></p><p>"Mm." Lu Changsheng nodded slightly.</p><p></p><p>"Mr. Lu, please come inside and have a seat, and let us serve you some tea!" </p><p></p><p>Han Tie hurriedly rubbed his hands and gestured towards their home, apologetically.</p><p></p><p>Han Yue's nickname was Iron Egg, as his father's name was Han Tie, so the nickname made sense.</p><p></p><p>"Alright." Lu Changsheng smiled and nodded.</p><p></p><p>...</p><p></p><p>The Han family was indeed the most impoverished among the fifteen students.</p><p></p><p>Their home was quite dilapidated, barely able to shelter them from the wind and rain.</p><p></p><p>However, it was overall still quite tidy.</p><p></p><p>"Mr. Lu, please have a seat and drink some tea, just give us a moment." </p><p></p><p>Han Tie brought over a cup of tea, feeling quite embarrassed.</p><p></p><p>They had just come from the muddy ground, and naturally needed to quickly wash up and change into cleaner clothes before they could have a proper conversation, otherwise it would be disrespectful.</p><p></p><p>"No rush, I'll just sit here for a while." Lu Changsheng smiled.</p><p></p><p>Soon after, the family of three sat properly in front of Lu Changsheng. Not just the middle Han Yue, even Han Tie and his mother Wu Cuilan sat upright.</p><p></p><p>Lu Changsheng glanced at Han Tie and Wu Cuilan - although they were middle-aged, their hair was already streaked with white, complemented by the wrinkles at the corners of their eyes and their sallow skin, making them appear quite aged.</p><p></p><p>Compared to Huang Xuan's parents, Huang Yulang and Zhang Shuihui, they were worlds apart.</p><p></p><p>Very real.</p><p></p><p>"Mr. Lu, has Iron Egg caused you any trouble? Has he angered you in any way?" Wu Cuilan was the first to speak up.</p><p></p><p>"No, Han Yue has performed well, he is a hardworking child, though he is the slowest among the students in memorizing the Three-Character Classic." Lu Changsheng smiled.</p><p></p><p>Han Yue lowered his head in shame.</p><p></p><p>Han Tie bitterly explained, "Mr. Lu, Iron Egg often helps us with chores after school, which has taken up a lot of his time."</p><p></p><p>He and Wu Cuilan couldn't stop him even if they tried - they naturally wanted Iron Egg to focus on his studies, but he was quite stubborn when it came to helping with the chores.</p><p></p><p>"It's alright." Lu Changsheng sipped his tea and smiled: "Han Yue, helping your parents with chores is a good thing, it shows your filial piety. But going forward, you need to prioritize your studies first, complete your learning tasks before helping your parents with chores. Only then, when you have achieved success in the future, will you have the ability to improve your family's conditions and let your parents live a better life. Do not put the cart before the horse."</p><p></p><p>Han Yue softly replied, "The teacher's teachings, the student will remember."</p><p></p><p>Han Tie and Wu Cuilan were delighted, couldn't help but exchange a glance, their eyes filled with appreciation - Mr. Lu's words were much more useful than theirs.</p><p></p><p>...</p><p></p><p>Afterwards, Lu Changsheng chatted with Han Yue's parents for quite a while, and in front of them, repeatedly praised Han Yue.</p><p></p><p>Han Yue's face flushed red, he knew his own worth, and while he felt warmed in his heart, he also secretly made a firm resolution to study hard.</p><p></p><p>Many times, only praise and affirmation can make a person confident and help them grow.</p><p></p><p>Criticism, on the other hand, is not always appropriate - it can sometimes make the person feel discouraged, dejected, and self-doubting.</p><p></p><p>For students from a family background like Han Yue's, praise and affirmation are especially important.</p><p></p><p>For someone like Huang Xuan, criticism would be more appropriate - frequent praise would only make him arrogant and complacent.</p><p></p><p>"Han Yue, you have the next two days off, don't come to the school." Lu Changsheng smiled.</p><p></p><p>Huh? Wasn't the day after tomorrow the start of classes again? How did an extra day of vacation appear?</p><p></p><p>Han Yue was slightly taken aback, but still replied, "Yes, teacher."</p><p></p><p>Seeing that Lu Changsheng was about to leave, Han Tie hurriedly...</p><p></p><p>Here is the full English translation of the Chinese excerpt:</p><p></p><p>Busy, Wu Cuilan glanced at the side!</p><p></p><p>Wu Cuilan reacted quickly and slapped herself on the head, hurriedly getting up and calling out, "Mr. Lu, look at my brain, I'll go cook right away. It's so late, you should stay and have dinner before leaving!"</p><p></p><p>Lu Changsheng stood up, shook his head with a smile, and patted his abdomen through the green robe, helplessly saying, "Don't bother, I'm doing home visits today, and every household has been very hospitable. If I keep eating, I'll end up bursting."</p><p></p><p>"Mr. Lu, please stay and have a bite!" Han Tie hurriedly stood up and smiled bitterly.</p><p></p><p>If other students' families were so hospitable, then they couldn't be left behind. Moreover, the teacher came for a home visit, and a meal was the least they could do!</p><p></p><p>Lu Changsheng originally wanted to refuse, but seeing Han Yuehui's hopeful gaze, he could only nod helplessly and sit down, "Okay, then I'll have a little more."</p><p></p><p>If he really left, they might think that their family's conditions were too poor, and that Lu Changsheng disdained them.</p><p></p><p>Lu Changsheng was overthinking too much, he was too troubled.</p><p></p><p>Of course, no matter how much he ate, he could never feel full. Even if he stuffed all the food from the Book of Martial Arts and Mysteries into his stomach, he still wouldn't feel full.</p><p></p><p>The reason Lu Changsheng was in a hurry to leave was that he was preparing to go fishing.</p><p></p><p>Sigh.</p><p></p><p>"That's great!" </p><p></p><p>Seeing this, Han Tie was overjoyed and said as he quickly walked away, "Then Mr. Lu, please have a seat, I'll go help Tiedai's mother."</p><p></p><p>Han Yue, who was alone and reserved, bowed to Lu Changsheng and then also ran to help.</p><p></p><p>...</p><p></p><p>Dinnertime.</p><p></p><p>Looking at the full table of dishes, Lu Changsheng knew that Han Yue's parents had bought them in advance, knowing that he would be coming for a home visit.</p><p></p><p>Otherwise, it wouldn't be possible to eat so well, as evidenced by the drooling look on Han Yue's face.</p><p></p><p>"Teacher, this is just simple fare, please don't mind," Han Tie scratched his head and smiled sheepishly.</p><p></p><p>Although he said that, this was far from simple fare. Their previous New Year's Eve dinner couldn't even compare to half the abundance of today's meal.</p><p></p><p>It's just that Han Tie felt that for Lu Changsheng, this might indeed be considered simple fare.</p><p></p><p>Lu Changsheng looked at the full table of dishes for a moment, his gaze flickering, and sighed, "Such abundance, how can it be called simple fare?"</p><p></p><p>The same table of abundant dishes, for some people, is just a trifle. But for some people, it represents their utmost effort and sacrifice.</p><p></p><p>The sincerity behind it cannot be compared.</p><p></p><p>After saying this, Lu Changsheng stretched out his hand and summoned a wine jar from across the table, completely ignoring the stunned trio, and poured himself a drink with a smile, "The dishes are so good, I must have a couple of sips."</p><p></p><p>...</p><p></p><p>After the meal, Lu Changsheng left the small village under the cover of night, with the Han Tie family seeing him off.</p><p></p><p>The day after tomorrow is the day when the Tianwu Sect tests the martial veins.</p><p></p><p>For a family like the Hans, if Han Yue has a martial vein, as long as his parents are not foolish, they will send him to the Tianwu Sect, which is a chance to turn his life around.</p><p></p><p>The abundant meal at the Han family today made Lu Changsheng's emotions difficult to express, so he had that little display of taking the wine jar with his mind during the meal.</p><p></p><p>He was indirectly telling Han Yue that his teacher is no ordinary person.</p><p></p><p>As for how Han Yue will choose the day after tomorrow, it depends on his own careful consideration.</p><p></p><p>Lu Changsheng's display tonight, though not flashy, was even ordinary, but it was still enough to repay the abundant meal. He could only do this much.</p><p></p><p>For families like the Hans, Lu Changsheng deeply knows how difficult it is to swim against the current and turn one's life around. One misstep... and it's all downhill from there.</p><p></p><p>Even if Han Yue goes to the Tianwu Sect, his ultimate achievements will still be very limited.</p><p></p><p>He is not a martial arts genius, but a talent in the way of the books.</p><p></p><p>There is never a shortage of geniuses in the world. What is lacking are the rare talents who can discover them.</p><p></p><p>Han Yue needs such a rare talent, and Lu Changsheng is that rare talent, the best talent scout in the world.</p>

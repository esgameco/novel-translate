        <h1>Chapter 286</h1>
        <div class="content">
            <p>Here is the full English translation of the Chinese excerpt:</p><p></p><p>Liu Tu and Liu Qing waited with pale faces. Soon, two people appeared in their line of sight.</p><p></p><p>Fu Liangcai bowed and led the way, with the senior swordsman wearing the bronze mask following behind him!</p><p></p><p>Fu Shiyu's nerves immediately tensed up, and she took a deep breath to calm herself down.</p><p></p><p>Liu Tu and the others immediately went to greet them, bowing respectfully:</p><p></p><p>"We have met the senior!"</p><p></p><p>Lu Changsheng's gaze swept over them, and he smiled kindly, "No need for so much courtesy, please rise."</p><p></p><p>The group was stunned, never expecting this senior to be so amiable! This was vastly different from the domineering and overbearing manner he had displayed when slaying Ouyang Zui ninety years ago.</p><p></p><p>"Thank you, senior!" Liu Tu led the group to stand upright.</p><p></p><p>Then the atmosphere fell into an awkward silence.</p><p></p><p>Fu Shiyu, Fu Tao, and Liu Xing, the junior disciples, kept their heads down, not daring to make eye contact with Lu Changsheng.</p><p></p><p>Liu Qing and Fu Liangcai glanced at each other awkwardly, unsure of what to say.</p><p></p><p>Only Liu Tu, who had reached the Divine Yang Realm, managed to endure the pressure as he respectfully asked, "Senior, shall we set out?"</p><p></p><p>Lu Changsheng replied gently, "Very well."</p><p></p><p>...</p><p></p><p>And so, Lu Changsheng and the group set out, their destination being the Ancient Wasteland King City. The group was not large, totaling only seven people.</p><p></p><p>Liu Tu, Fu Liangcai, Liu Qing, and Fu Shiyu were the junior disciples. The remaining elders from the two clans, although wanting to go, did not dare to speak up.</p><p></p><p>Meanwhile, at an unnamed volcano, a figure engulfed in flames suddenly shot out from the volcano's mouth, only to halt abruptly in mid-air. It was Li Shueyan, who had cultivated the Myriad Flames Technique.</p><p></p><p>Li Shueyan, now bald, sighed as he put on his robes, having given up on his hair. He then clenched his fists, feeling the immense power within him, a look of fascination on his face.</p><p></p><p>"The senior was right, as long as the physical body is strong, the cultivation will rise rapidly. If spiritual energy is water, then the physical body is the container, and the larger and higher the quality of the container, the more water it can hold."</p><p></p><p>With that, Li Shueyan tore open the space and set off in a certain direction, heading towards the Grand Celestial Assembly.</p><p></p><p>...</p><p></p><p>In the sky, the flying ship sped across the horizon. On the deck, Lu Changsheng stood by the railing, gazing at the disappearing landscape below.</p><p></p><p>Liu Tu and the others sat in meditation, passing the time through cultivation. They had calculated that by the time they reached the Ancient Wasteland King City, the Grand Celestial Assembly would likely have already begun.</p><p></p><p>At this moment, Fu Shiyu opened her eyes, pretending to look outside, but her gaze was focused on the figure of the senior in blue. Her heart was pounding, and her eyes were trembling. She was certain that this mysterious senior in blue was the same powerful figure who had struck that sword in the endless void, the one who had slain Ouyang Zui. The sword cries were unmistakable.</p><p></p><p>Here is the full English translation of the Chinese excerpt:</p><p></p><p>The sword's cry had just faded away in the boundless void, when this senior in azure robes suddenly appeared behind them without them noticing.</p><p></p><p>In this world, how could there be so many coincidences?</p><p></p><p>This terrifying and peerless senior in azure robes... what was his purpose?</p><p></p><p>With such powerful cultivation, what would his face behind the mask look like?</p><p></p><p>Thinking about this, Fu Shiyu suddenly shuddered. Why was she even thinking about this?</p><p></p><p>As for the senior's purpose, she didn't want to think about it either, as these were things she couldn't comprehend.</p><p></p><p>In any case, the senior didn't seem to have any ill intentions towards their two tribes, for if he did, their two tribes wouldn't have survived until now.</p><p></p><p>Just then, Fu Shiyu caught a glimpse of the azure-robed figure turning his head to look at her.</p><p></p><p>She paused, then mustered her courage and turned to give Lu Changsheng a respectful yet awkward smile, quickly closing her eyes afterwards to resume her cultivation.</p><p></p><p>However, the rise and fall of her chest betrayed her inner turmoil.</p><p></p><p>Lu Changsheng averted his gaze, returning his eyes to the scene below, his expression as calm as a deep well.</p><p></p><p>...</p><p></p><p>Within the Ancient Wasteland Ruins, various forces were rushing their young prodigies towards the Ancient Wasteland City.</p><p></p><p>Even before the Prodigy Assembly had fully commenced, news of the top ten peak prodigies had already spread.</p><p></p><p>These top ten peak prodigies were the most likely to seize the top positions.</p><p></p><p>Especially the top five, whose identities were increasingly terrifying, and whose strengths were greater than the others!</p><p></p><p>The Holy Son of the Blood Demon Sect - Esha.</p><p>The Young Master of the Nangong Clan - Nangong Wenxin.</p><p>The Junior Hall Master of the Assassin Tower - Wuying.</p><p>The Young Master of the Li Clan - Li Qing.</p><p>The fifth prodigy was rather mysterious, with an unknown name and background, only referred to as Blood Moon.</p><p></p><p>Rumor had it that all ten of these peak prodigy candidates had already reached the Divine Yang Realm, all under a million years old!</p><p>How terrifying!</p><p></p><p>However, the specific number of times these top ten peak prodigies had consolidated their Divine Yang Realm was unknown to all.</p><p></p><p>In any case, this session of the Prodigy Assembly seemed to have an overall strength surpassing the previous one!</p><p></p><p>...</p><p></p><p>Time passed by another nine years.</p><p></p><p>The Ancient Wasteland City was now teeming with figures.</p><p></p><p>As far as the eye could see, there were countless experts, with Immortal Emperors walking the streets, Immortal Patriarchs as numerous as dogs, and even Spiritual Origin Realm cultivators were considered ordinary here. Only the Divine Yang Realm cultivators were still relatively few, far from the point where one could see them at every step.</p><p></p><p>In the sky, endless streams of colorful lights were continuously arriving at the Ancient Wasteland City, all carrying the young prodigies of various forces to participate in the assembly.</p><p></p><p>On the flying ship, </p><p>Liu Tu and the others came to the railing, gazing at the gradually emerging, massive ancient city, watching the countless colorful lights disappearing into the city. Their hearts were filled with excitement.</p><p></p><p>The Ancient Wasteland City, they had finally arrived!</p><p></p><p>The much-anticipated Prodigy Assembly was about to begin, and a series of thrilling battles were about to unfold.</p><p>They would also have the chance to see those peak prodigies as rare as phoenix feathers and unicorn horns in the Ancient Wasteland Ruins, as well as the leaders of the major forces.</p><p></p><p>If they were lucky, they might even catch a glimpse of the peak experts of the Ancient Wasteland Sword Clan!</p><p></p><p>Fu Liancai came up behind Lu Changsheng and respectfully said, "Senior Lu, we have arrived at the Ancient Wasteland City."</p><p></p><p>"Mm." Lu Changsheng lightly nodded his head, looking at the boundless ancient city before him.</p><p></p><p>He then asked, "How do we register for the Prodigy Assembly?"</p><p></p><p>The group: "...?"</p><p></p><p>Liu Tu and the others' expressions betrayed their bewilderment. Had they heard wrong?</p><p></p><p>Seeing Fu Liancai's stunned reaction, Lu Changsheng asked again, "I asked how to register for the Prodigy Assembly."</p><p></p><p>"Ah, yes, yes!" Fu Liancai snapped out of his daze, wiping the cold sweat from his forehead, and respectfully said, "Senior, every Prodigy Assembly will have a testing stone set up at the venue. I'm sure there will be one in the Ancient Wasteland City as well. Participants only need to go and take the test. As long as their strength and bone age meet the requirements, they can participate..."</p><p></p><p>Lu Changsheng smiled, "Excellent."</p><p></p><p>The group was left speechless, wanting to say something but not daring to.</p><p>They wanted to say, "Senior, the Prodigy Assembly has an age limit of one million years. Surely you, being in the late Divine Yang Realm, can't still be under a million years old, right?"</p><p></p><p>Fu Liancai was worried that Lu Changsheng might embarrass himself at the testing stone, so he mustered his courage to say, "Senior Lu, the Prodigy Assembly has an age limit of one million years... You... You..."</p><p></p><p>Behind the bronze mask, Lu Changsheng's face showed no change in expression. "I'm still young, so I should be fine."</p>

        <h1>Chapter 215</h1>
        <div class="content">
            <p>Here is the full English translation of the Chinese excerpt:</p><p></p><p>The cultivators were greatly shaken by Zhong Wuyan's display! </p><p></p><p>As the Grand Elder of the Great Sun Thunder Sect, Zhong Wuyan's previous display could be described as commanding the thunders with ease!</p><p></p><p>Hearing Zhong Wuyan's question, the cultivators snapped out of their shock. They glanced at each other, shaking their heads - they had no idea if the Carefree Sect had arrived or not, as most of them had never even seen the Carefree Sect before.</p><p></p><p>In the Great Sun Thunder Sect camp, Leiyu's gaze swept around, not seeing the figure in blue robes, and couldn't help but feel a bit disappointed.</p><p></p><p>At this time, among the elders behind Lu Ye, Elder Fu Mingyan stepped forward, cupping his hands and smiling at Zhong Wuyan, "Elder Zhong, I previously encountered the Carefree Sect on the Extreme Cold Glacier and recognized them. But there are no signs of the Carefree Sect here, so they should not have arrived yet."</p><p></p><p>Zhong Wuyan returned the greeting with a nod, then closed his eyes.</p><p></p><p>Seeing this, the cultivators quickly fell silent, their gazes flickering as they waited.</p><p></p><p>Lu Ye and Li Tailing slowly sat down on the chairs prepared by their own elders. They were the only ones sitting, their status and position evident.</p><p></p><p>In this moment, the Sunset Thunder Forest fell silent once again.</p><p></p><p>...</p><p></p><p>Time passed, the sun was now high in the sky! It was noon...</p><p></p><p>The cultivators couldn't help but become restless, whispering to each other in the darkness:</p><p></p><p>"The Carefree Sect is really putting on a show! Making everyone wait for them the entire morning!"</p><p></p><p>"Indeed, even we can overlook it, but the Sect Master of the Mysterious Fire Sect and the Lord of the Heavenly Sword Hall are here, so many distinguished figures. Look, even the Sect Master of our sect seems to be in a bad mood."</p><p></p><p>"In my opinion, this battle across realms is doomed to fail."</p><p></p><p>"Fellow Daoist, what do you mean by that?"</p><p></p><p>"What else could I mean? The Carefree Sect is obviously afraid and has run away!"</p><p></p><p>"Hehe, the Carefree Sect is indeed just seeking attention. But how naive, do they think they still have a place in the Lingering Aura Heavens after this?"</p><p></p><p>"..."</p><p></p><p>In the Great Sun Thunder Sect camp, the elder disciples also had displeased expressions. Well done, they were actually outmaneuvered by the Carefree Sect.</p><p></p><p>Originally, it should have been the Carefree Sect waiting for the Great Sun Thunder Sect, but the result... Damn it!</p><p></p><p>Zhong Wuyan opened his eyes, looked up at the sun, and felt the strange gazes around him. He said indifferently, "As the number one sect in the Human Realm, the Great Sun Thunder Sect has not been arrogant. We have followed the rules of crossing realms and have given the Carefree Sect face... But the Carefree Sect has let everyone down."</p><p></p><p>The cultivators heard these words and inwardly praised the magnanimity of the Great Sun Thunder Sect as the number one sect in the Human Realm!</p><p></p><p>"Wait for the time it takes to drink a cup of tea. If the Carefree Sect still does not arrive, this battle across realms will be canceled," Zhong Wuyan said expressionlessly before closing his eyes again.</p><p></p><p>He couldn't possibly have the elders and disciples wait here indefinitely, that would only further diminish their status.</p><p></p><p>Suddenly, the sound of numerous sonic booms pierced the air!!</p><p></p><p>Lu Ye and Li Tailing's eyes flashed, and they exchanged a glance.</p><p></p><p>Zhong Wuyan's brow also slightly furrowed as he abruptly opened his eyes!</p><p></p><p>In just a moment, the cultivators in the Sunset Thunder Forest became agitated! Their expressions changed, becoming excited and thrilled!</p><p></p><p>Could it be...!</p><p></p><p>The next instant, over ten thousand figures appeared in the center, standing in opposition to the Great Sun Thunder Sect!!</p><p></p><p>The Carefree Sect!!</p><p></p><p>Whether it was Lu Ye, Li Tailing, the elders, or all the other people present, they immediately turned their gazes towards them, their eyes flickering with a scrutinizing gaze!</p><p></p><p>After a thorough inspection, both Lu Ye and Li Tailing were inwardly shocked.</p><p></p><p>Even though they had known about the Carefree Sect's elders beforehand...</p><p></p><p>Here is the full English translation of the Chinese excerpt:</p><p></p><p>All the elders present were Immortal Sovereigns, but after a closer inspection... they were actually not ordinary Immortal Sovereigns?!</p><p></p><p>[New 69 Book Bar â†’ 69shu.com]</p><p></p><p>With their cultivation, they could see at a glance that among the five elder leaders of the Carefree Sect, except for the one wearing a mask who was an Eighth-Rank Immortal Sovereign, the other three were two Peak Ninth-Rank Immortal Sovereigns and one First-Step Immortal Emperor!</p><p></p><p>And that fat man in the middle...</p><p></p><p>Lu Ye and Li Tai Ling exchanged a glance, both seeing the gravity in each other's eyes.</p><p></p><p>Peak Ninth-Rank Immortal Emperor!!!</p><p></p><p>Just a step away from reaching the Immortal Ancestor Realm!!</p><p></p><p>Such cultivation, even in the entire Linglang Heavens, was as rare as phoenix feathers and unicorn horns!</p><p></p><p>Why were they so grave?</p><p></p><p>It was because they knew that the fat leader was not the Sect Master of the Carefree Sect!</p><p></p><p>To be able to command a Ninth-Rank Immortal Emperor... then the mysterious Sect Master of the Carefree Sect's cultivation...</p><p></p><p>The whole matter suddenly became increasingly puzzling.</p><p></p><p>In the Linglang Heavens, the Immortal Ancestor Realm experts, they all knew them, and they basically all existed within the Nine First-Rank Sects.</p><p></p><p>However, there were three Wandering Cultivators, could it be that the Carefree Sect Master was one of those three Wandering Cultivators??</p><p></p><p>If that was the case, then what was his intention in establishing the Carefree Sect and surpassing the Great Day Thunder Sect?</p><p></p><p>And they also remembered that the relationship between those three Wandering Cultivators and Luo Cheng Dong was quite good...</p><p></p><p>The surrounding cultivators and the elder disciples of the Great Day Thunder Sect were also filled with shock and gravity!</p><p></p><p>This is the Carefree Sect?!</p><p></p><p>A Ninth-Rank Sect?</p><p></p><p>Before they could ponder further, Zhong Wu Yan suddenly stepped forward, interrupting the thoughts and doubts of the crowd.</p><p></p><p>His eyes held a barely perceptible gravity as he said, "The Surpassing Battle has already begun since dawn, yet you Carefree Sect have come late. Do you know who else is waiting here besides our Great Day Thunder Sect?"</p><p></p><p>The cultivators couldn't help but glance at Lu Ye and Li Tai Ling.</p><p></p><p>Peng Fang, with his hands behind his back and a big belly, chuckled nonchalantly, "We're very sorry, we Carefree Sect overslept, and have kept you and the others waiting..."</p><p></p><p>However, his tone, demeanor, and body language did not contain the slightest hint of apology!</p><p></p><p>Instead, it exuded arrogance everywhere!</p><p></p><p>Overslept??</p><p></p><p>The cultivators' eyes narrowed with anger, even Lu Ye and the others were stunned.</p><p></p><p>Even if it was an excuse, it was so perfunctory...</p><p></p><p>The Carefree Sect, truly arrogant.</p><p></p><p>Zhong Wu Yan's expression visibly darkened, and even he found it difficult to remain calm in the face of such brazen arrogance.</p><p></p><p>"You tiny Carefree Sect are simply outrageous!! Do you know how many people you have offended with this statement?!" Zhong Wu Yan's second elder, Zhao Shen, couldn't help but step forward and shout.</p><p></p><p>Left Qiu Shan sneered and directly glared at him, cursing, "Damn dog!"</p><p></p><p>Zhao Shen was taken aback, but then an endless fury rose in him. He stared at Left Qiu Shan, his eyes flashing with electricity, and said indifferently, "You are the first one in this human domain to dare curse me, the elder, so directly. Just for this sentence, today, none of you from the Carefree Sect..."</p><p></p><p>"Will be allowed to live!!!"</p><p></p><p>As Zhao Shen's shout fell, the crowd of the Great Day Thunder Sect tensed, suddenly surging with Immortal Qi, and the sky above was instantly filled with rumbling thunder, a terrifying sight!</p><p></p><p>The cultivators were already numb... They didn't expect the Carefree Sect to be so arrogant and presumptuous! When they encountered the Great Day Thunder Sect, such an intense conflict had already erupted.</p><p></p><p>But... the more intense, the better, the more intense, the more enjoyable it would be to watch!</p><p></p><p>"Hahaha!!!"</p><p></p><p>At this moment, Left Qiu Shan suddenly threw his head back and laughed loudly, then stepped forward, bypassing Peng Fang, his eyes glaring at Zhao Shen like venomous snakes.</p><p></p><p>"If the Surpassing Battle fails, your Great Day Thunder Sect will have to be destroyed by our Carefree Sect, won't you?"</p><p></p><p>"So no need for nonsense... let's just start the battle!"</p>

        <h1>Chapter 514</h1>
        <div class="content">
            <p>Here is the full English translation of the Chinese excerpt:</p><p></p><p>The Eighth Creation Pillar</p><p></p><p>Luchang Sheng traversed through countless brilliant nebulae. Upon arriving at each mother star system, he would briefly stop to check the damage, which did end up costing him some time.</p><p></p><p>Just as he had expected, the Devouring Void Sacred Demons had all withdrawn from the mother star systems.</p><p></p><p>Time passed in this manner, until at a certain moment, Luchang Sheng's figure paused, and he frowned as he gazed into the depths of the void beyond the Creation Pillar.</p><p></p><p>Seven more faint auras were approaching the Eighth Creation Pillar...</p><p></p><p>There was no need to guess - they were the other seven Sacred Demon Gods.</p><p></p><p>Luchang Sheng had originally intended to destroy the Sacred Demon Gods one by one, but he never expected the Devouring Void Sacred Demon Clan to be so cautious.</p><p></p><p>"This battle may be the most difficult one in history," Luchang Sheng murmured, his blue eyes flickering.</p><p></p><p>While he was confident in himself, the fact was that the Devouring Void Sacred Demon Clan was truly formidable. Their ability to penetrate the endless void and gnaw at the Creation Pillars was proof enough.</p><p></p><p>Eight Sacred Demon Gods - even Luchang Sheng had to treat them with the utmost seriousness.</p><p></p><p>Luchang Sheng pursed his lips and continued towards the top of the Creation Pillar.</p><p></p><p>...</p><p></p><p>Time flew by, and a million years passed in the blink of an eye.</p><p></p><p>One day, vast images suddenly appeared in the endless void, blocking out the sky.</p><p></p><p>The sentient beings of the Four Directions Immortal Realms, the Heavenly Scar, the Exquisite Heaven, the Ancestral Heavenly God Realm, the Eternal Vast Realm, the Divine-Demonic Battlefield, the Qian-Kun Heaven, the Three Thousand Dharma Realms, and more, all looked up uneasily at the boundless celestial images.</p><p></p><p>The images seemed to be projected from the depths of the endless void, and were currently in violent fluctuation, so that no one could make out the scenes within.</p><p></p><p>But soon, the images gradually became clearer.</p><p></p><p>The scenes they revealed left all the beings in the various worlds utterly shocked and terrified!</p><p></p><p>Darkness, deathly silence, mystery, the boundless and profound vastness filled the contracted pupils of the sentient beings.</p><p></p><p>It was as if an ancient battlefield suspended in the starry sky. In the uppermost reaches, there was a layered, arched silver-white rampart, beyond which seemed to lie unknown depths.</p><p></p><p>At the same time, within the ancient battlefield, there stood a massive palace, as if crafted from peerless crystal.</p><p></p><p>Most importantly, outside the crystal palace, there hovered an endless multitude of monstrosities. Their eyes were bloodshot and malicious, their limbs sharp, their wings slowly flapping and exuding an aura of unparalleled evil.</p><p></p><p>Even through the images, the sentient beings felt terror and bone-chilling cold!</p><p></p><p>Where was this place in the images? What were those monstrosities? What was their purpose?...</p><p></p><p>Countless questions arose in the minds of the sentient beings, but one thing was certain - their hearts had become extremely panicked the moment they saw this sight!</p><p></p><p>"Hehehe..." </p><p></p><p>Just then, a voice of utmost cruelty rang out from the images, causing the sentient beings to involuntarily retreat a few steps, instinctively covering their ears, but to no avail, as the eerie, chilling laughter continued to resound in their minds.</p><p></p><p>The sentient beings fearfully watched the images, all eyes focused on the top of the crystal white palace, where the monster with a crown and seven pairs of wings, clearly the highest in status, was.</p><p></p><p>"Allow me to introduce myself, I am the invincible Devouring Void Sacred Demon, the Sacred Demon God Saviér," the monster in the image said with a sinister laugh.</p><p></p><p>Devouring Void Sacred Demon? Sacred Demon God?</p><p></p><p>The sentient beings' gazes were filled with trepidation - just the name sounded incredibly powerful!</p><p></p><p>What was their purpose...?</p><p></p><p>Saviér then continued, as if talking to himself, with a disdainful, mocking, indifferent, and superior tone:</p><p></p><p>"You wretched crawling insects, the endless void does have an end, hehe, didn't expect that, did you? No wonder you are called pitiful crawling insects."</p><p></p><p>"The endless void, supported by eight Creation Pillars - my Devouring Void Sacred Demon Clan has come to gnaw at those eight Creation Pillars. Once the eight Creation Pillars collapse, the endless void will crumble, and all you crawling insects will be annihilated!"</p><p></p><p>As the words fell, the sentient beings were stunned, trembling, as if their worldview had been shaken.</p><p></p><p>The endless void, which was supposed to be boundless, suddenly had an edge! Impossible! Impossible!</p><p></p><p>The sentient beings forced themselves not to believe it, but somehow, their subconscious accepted it, uncontrollably.</p><p></p><p>The collapse of the endless void, and their own impending death!</p><p></p><p>They were going to die soon!</p><p></p><p>Saviér pointed a claw towards the silver-white rampart above: "Do you crawling insects see this rampart? The place I reside in is the very top of the Eighth Creation Pillar, the edge of the endless void. Even if you crawling insects are given a hundred billion lifetimes, you will never be able to reach this place!"</p><p></p><p>The sentient beings looked on, their minds growing increasingly muddled, their hearts trembling in terror.</p><p></p><p>"Originally, the energy absorption of the Creation Pillars was already in its final stage, and you crawling insects were about to die. But..." </p><p></p><p>Saviér suddenly lost his composure, baring his teeth in mockery:</p><p></p><p>"But do you crawling insects know? There is actually someone with the ability to reach the Creation Pillars in this endless void! He dares to obstruct the advance of my Devouring Void Sacred Demon Clan! He does have some strength, but he shall die!"</p><p></p><p>The sentient beings' gazes were bewildered, then slowly turned to shock.</p><p></p><p>Someone... went to the Creation Pillars? </p><p></p><p>How did they reach it... they knew nothing about this!</p><p></p><p>Here is the full English translation of the Chinese excerpt:</p><p></p><p>The heavens of the worlds roared with Seville's maniacal laughter, like a speech:</p><p></p><p>"He dares to try to stop us! He dares to challenge my supreme Devouring Void Saint Demon Clan! He dares to be the savior of this endless void!"</p><p></p><p>"I can tell you all!"</p><p></p><p>"He... is not worthy!!"</p><p></p><p>Countless worlds fell silent, and countless beings trembled in fear!</p><p></p><p>"Ahahaha!!"</p><p></p><p>In the scene, Seville cruelly laughed, as if thinking of something, excitedly gesturing.</p><p></p><p>"I originally wanted to let you worms perish in ignorance, but that person has changed my mind! This is also the reason you can see this scene!!"</p><p></p><p>"He wants to challenge my Devouring Void Saint Demon Clan? Fine!"</p><p></p><p>"But he wants to keep it a secret? No way!!"</p><p></p><p>"I insist on making it known to all! I want to let all you worms see him being tortured and killed by my Devouring Void Saint Demon Clan!! The nail that sticks out will be punished!"</p><p></p><p>"Do you know who he is? Hehe, he is your Dao Venerable of the endless void, the Dao Venerable who guards the order of all things! What a resounding title!"</p><p></p><p>Saying this, Seville calmed down. He didn't know that the beings had already been stunned, because they could see him through the scene, but in front of him there was only endless darkness.</p><p></p><p>However, Seville could guess the current mood of the beings, and his mood became even more delighted.</p><p></p><p>"Of course, killing him is one aspect, but the most important thing is that I want to let all you worms watch helplessly, watch him fight alone, be tortured, and you can do nothing about it, anxious, self-blaming to death, full of regret - ah, how wonderful, just thinking about it makes me tremble with excitement!"</p><p></p><p>Dao... Venerable!</p><p></p><p>The beings snapped back to their senses, panting heavily, as if a huge rock was pressing on their hearts.</p><p></p><p>They became infinitely angry, their faces pale and bloodless. They were no longer afraid of the Devouring Void Saint Demons, but now they were afraid that the words of the monster in the scene would become reality!</p><p></p><p>Afraid that the Dao Venerable would be tortured!</p><p></p><p>Just thinking about it, the beings' hearts convulsed, and a deep sense of helplessness overwhelmed them!</p><p></p><p>Even before the Dao Venerable appeared, the monster's few words had already achieved it, achieved making them self-blaming to death and full of regret!</p><p></p><p>Countless worlds fell silent, and Seville also stopped speaking. The beings looked up at the scene like petrified, as if they had lost their vitality, silently and agonizingly waiting.</p><p></p><p>They wanted to see their Dao Venerable.</p><p></p><p>...</p><p></p><p>At the same time,</p><p></p><p>in the Four Directions Immortal Realms, the Heavenly Scar, the Linglong Heaven, the Ancestral Heavenly God Realm, the Eternal Vast Realm, the Divine-Demonic Battlefield, the Qiankun Heaven, and the Three Thousand Dharma Realms, the beings were also staring at the scene without blinking.</p><p></p><p>In these worlds, there were countless familiar faces - Leiyu and Leiting, Xing Tian, Divine Emperor Yintao, Chu Lingxian, Gu Yinyang, Shi Wushi, Feng Jiu, the Fushi Yurong siblings, Jian Wuhui, Han Jinlong, Yan Jueyi, Man Tian, Jiang Wuxin, Ye Xunwang, Ke Ning, Yun Aoye, Chen Pangxiaochai, and many more!</p><p></p><p>In the Qiankun Heaven.</p><p></p><p>After countless years, the Carefree Sect members had long since gathered together, established their sect, and cultivated diligently, waiting for their sect master to take them away.</p><p></p><p>They had inquired, and knew that their sect master had once appeared in the Hollow Ancient Realm, but then disappeared without a trace.</p><p></p><p>The Carefree Sect members knew that their sect master had always been a free and easy wanderer, fond of traveling the four corners of the world.</p><p></p><p>But this time, it had been the longest. Too long.</p><p></p><p>At this moment, in the Carefree Sect.</p><p></p><p>All the elders and disciples had gathered together, trembling as they looked at the scene above the dome.</p><p></p><p>Elder Peng Fang, Left Qiushan, and others had solemn expressions.</p><p></p><p>This was truly a great calamity, not an exaggeration to call it a "death calamity".</p><p></p><p>They were not afraid of death, only wanting to see the memory of the young man in green one more time before they died.</p><p></p><p>But that seemed to be a luxury.</p><p></p><p>Sect Master, where are you? Are you still well?</p><p></p><p>In the dome scene, more and more Devouring Void Saint Demons gathered, endless and terrifying.</p><p></p><p>Later, even seven more Devouring Void Saint Demons with seven pairs of wings and crowned heads descended!</p><p></p><p>Their jet-black steel-like bodies seemed to conceal unimaginable power!</p><p></p><p>Even though they were separated by the screen, even though they were infinitely far away, they still made one's bones chill!</p><p></p><p>"Brother, these Devouring Void Saint Demons are too terrifying. I'm afraid the Dao Venerable..."</p><p></p><p>Lin Dong sighed bitterly.</p><p></p><p>Tong Xin glanced at the equally heavy-hearted Gu Helin and Chen Dadao, and said dejectedly, "I just want to see the Sect Master one more time."</p><p></p><p>"Brother!! Brother!!"</p><p></p><p>Lin Dong suddenly stared intently at the screen, stammering.</p><p></p><p>"What's wrong?" Tong Xin asked, head lowered in gloom.</p><p></p><p>Tong Xin suddenly noticed that the entire sect had fallen completely silent, and all the elders and disciples were looking up at the screen with their breaths extremely erratic!</p><p></p><p>Tong Xin was puzzled and slowly looked up.</p><p></p><p>When he saw the figure of a young man in green, holding a sword and standing alone in front of the vast army of Devouring Void Saint Demons that had appeared on the screen, Tong Xin's eyes suddenly turned red, and his breath became extremely erratic!</p>

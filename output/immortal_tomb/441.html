        <h1>Chapter 441</h1>
        <div class="content">
            <p>Here is the full English translation of the Chinese excerpt:</p><p></p><p>The old turtle gestured to the dancing girl with his eyes, then quickly got up from the bed, put on his clothes with a wave of his hand, and then went to open the door a little, where he saw a figure about to leave.</p><p></p><p>It was indeed Zhu Xingqiu. What was he doing here?</p><p></p><p>The old turtle's eyes flashed, and he asked suspiciously, "Grand Steward, what are you doing here?"</p><p></p><p>Zhu Xingqiu was stunned for a moment, turned around, and saw the old turtle, looking confused: "Senior Turtle? Senior?"</p><p></p><p>The old turtle coughed dryly and stepped out of the room without a change in expression. "You haven't answered why you are here."</p><p></p><p>Zhu Xingqiu bowed and then explained the matter to the old turtle in detail.</p><p></p><p>A moment later, the old turtle, who had understood the whole situation, pointed at Zhu Xingqiu and said unhappily, "Well, so you are the so-called Divine Spirit Realm cultivator from the ancient Wind Luan Kingdom!"</p><p></p><p>Zhu Xingqiu gave an embarrassed smile.</p><p></p><p>The old turtle stared at him for a long time, until Zhu Xingqiu felt puzzled, then shook his head and said, "You'd better leave quickly. At a time like this, coming to find your master, are you not tired of living?"</p><p></p><p>Zhu Xingqiu's face turned pale, and he could only nod. Just as he was about to leave, the old turtle suddenly asked, "Do you know where Elder Peng and the others, as well as Li Shuryan and the children, are now?"</p><p></p><p>Zhu Xingqiu shook his head and sighed, "Senior Turtle, after the Sect Master sent us out that day, the Grand Elder just gave a few casual instructions, and everyone went their separate ways. How could I know where they are?"</p><p></p><p>"Alright, you'd better leave quickly and behave yourself!" The old turtle waved his hand.</p><p></p><p>"Yes, Senior Turtle, then I'll take my leave." Zhu Xingqiu bowed slightly and then disappeared.</p><p></p><p>The old turtle smacked his lips, no longer interested, tightened his belt, and then sent the dancing girl away with some treasures.</p><p></p><p>...</p><p></p><p>A few days later, the entire Wind Luan army was wiped out, and the Wind Luan monarch was also slain by Ye Xunwang. The ancient Cloudy Mist Kingdom achieved a complete victory.</p><p></p><p>Yun Zeqing did not hesitate and immediately led his troops to the Wind Luan Kingdom. Now was the best time to annex Wind Luan, as the Wind Luan monarch had been killed, and the elite troops had been completely destroyed.</p><p></p><p>After a few months, the ancient Wind Luan Kingdom was successfully merged into the Cloudy Mist Kingdom.</p><p></p><p>Yun Zeqing was excited in his heart. He issued a general amnesty, and for the next hundred years, the towns and cities of his Cloudy Mist Kingdom would have a 30% tax reduction.</p><p></p><p>In the Cloudy Mist Palace,</p><p></p><p>Yun Zeqing held a grand banquet, inviting all the officials. Of course, Yun Zeqing went to the Observation Pavilion in person to invite Lu Changsheng, but he was rejected.</p><p></p><p>Yun Zeqing thought it was because of the previous banquet that left a bad impression on Lu Changsheng, so he repeatedly assured that nothing like the previous banquet would happen again.</p><p></p><p>Seeing that Lu Changsheng still refused, Yun Zeqing could only bow and withdraw, finally ordering that whatever was served at the banquet should also be arranged at the Observation Pavilion.</p><p></p><p>At the banquet, cups and plates were exchanged, and Yun Zeqing suddenly noticed that Ye Xunwang's expression did not seem too good. His eyes flashed with puzzlement as he asked, "Brother, do you have something on your mind?"</p><p></p><p>Ye Xunwang came back to his senses and did not hide it, sighing and saying directly, "A few days ago, the family contacted me."</p><p></p><p>What?</p><p></p><p>Yun Zeqing was stunned and stammered, "Brother, how long have you been away from the family? Why did they suddenly contact you, and what's more puzzling is how they were able to contact you after all these years?"</p><p></p><p>Ye Xunwang pressed his lips, and a palm opened, revealing a red glow slowly emerging from his palm. "At first, I was also surprised, but later I found out that the family could contact me because of this hidden bloodline mark in my body. Not only can the family contact me through this, but I estimate they can also clearly know my location."</p><p></p><p>Huh?</p><p></p><p>Yun Zeqing stared in shock at the red glow in Ye Xunwang's palm, a bloodline mark?</p><p></p><p>Here is my translation of the Chinese excerpt:</p><p></p><p>Cloud Zeshuang looked at the bloodline mark and said solemnly, "Worthy brother, that is ultimately..."</p><p></p><p>Ye Xunwang shook his head, "They didn't say, they just told me to go back, so I don't know either."</p><p></p><p>Cloud Zeshuang nodded and then asked, "So are you going back?"</p><p></p><p>"En, I'll go back, otherwise it might implicate you, the ancient Cloud Lan Kingdom," Ye Xunwang said softly.</p><p></p><p>"Between us, what is there to talk about implicating or not implicating." Cloud Zeshuang waved his hand and then said solemnly, "Worthy brother, if there is anything you need, this king will definitely give you full assistance. Although our ancient Cloud Lan Kingdom may be declining compared to your ancient families, I have now swallowed the Feng Luan and am qualified to apply to become a member of the League of Nations. Who knows, I may be able to help you then."</p><p></p><p>Ye Xunwang was moved, but inwardly he couldn't help but smile. He really wanted to say: Your Majesty, you don't know the powerful strength of those ancient families. Not to mention being a member of the League of Nations, even if it was the overlord of the League of Nations, it would still just be a puppet supported by those ancient families.</p><p></p><p>Of course, these words Ye Xunwang would never say. He just gratefully smiled and said, "Thank you, Your Majesty, for your kindness. If I really need it, I'll trouble you then."</p><p></p><p>Cloud Zeshuang waved his hand unconcernedly, "Then when will the worthy brother set out?"</p><p></p><p>"Early tomorrow morning," Ye Xunwang replied without hesitation.</p><p></p><p>"So urgent?" Cloud Zeshuang raised his eyebrows.</p><p></p><p>"En, early tomorrow morning, I'll go to the Observation Pavilion to bid farewell to Elder Qing, and then set out to return to the clan," Ye Xunwang said, and then suddenly solemnly admonished, "Your Majesty, Elder Qing also doesn't know how long he will stay in the ancient Cloud Lan Kingdom, but every day he is here, you must do your utmost to serve him well!"</p><p></p><p>Cloud Zeshuang's brow furrowed as he promised, "The worthy brother can rest assured."</p><p></p><p>Ye Xunwang thought of LÃ¼ Changsheng's various deeds and couldn't help but reverently exclaim, "Your Majesty doesn't know, everything Elder Qing has shown, even in the ancient families, must be a top-tier existence."</p><p></p><p>Cloud Zeshuang's heart jumped as he said in a deep voice, "This king understands."</p><p></p><p>Afterwards, Ye Xunwang bid farewell to some of the princes and princesses he was closer to, after all, this time going back, it was uncertain whether he could return or not.</p><p></p><p>"Uncle Ye, are you leaving the ancient Cloud Lan Kingdom?" Cloud Aoxie exclaimed in surprise.</p><p></p><p>"En." Ye Xunwang gently patted Cloud Aoxie's head and smiled, "Aoxie, Uncle Ye has seen it in your eyes. Among all the princes, you are the most outstanding. Your father has also privately talked to Uncle Ye, and has the intention to make you the crown prince."</p><p></p><p>However, Cloud Aoxie did not feel happy. "Uncle Ye, I'm not interested in being the crown prince at all."</p><p></p><p>Ye Xunwang's face became solemn. "The position of crown prince doesn't interest you, then what are you interested in?"</p><p></p><p>Cloud Aoxie instinctively said, "Women."</p><p></p><p>Cloud Aoxie regretted it as soon as he said it. He saw Ye Xunwang about to raise his hand to slap him, so he quickly took a step back and smiled bitterly, "Uncle Ye, you actually understand Aoxie. Aoxie has no great ambitions in this life, I just want to enjoy the present."</p><p></p><p>Ye Xunwang looked at him for a long time and sighed, "Do as you please, as long as you can get past your father's test."</p><p></p><p>Cloud Aoxie smiled awkwardly and quickly changed the subject, "Oh yes, Uncle Ye, since you are leaving, you should go to the Observation Pavilion to bid farewell to the Elder!"</p><p></p><p>"Does Uncle Ye need you to remind me?" Ye Xunwang said impatiently, looking towards the Observation Pavilion, "Early tomorrow morning, Uncle Ye will go to the Observation Pavilion to bid farewell to the Elder. It's just a pity that I haven't learned the Elder's piano skills even to a superficial level... Sigh."</p>

        <h1>Chapter 305</h1>
        <div class="content">
            <p>Here is the full English translation of the Chinese excerpt:</p><p></p><p>The plaza of the City Lord's Mansion was deathly silent.</p><p></p><p>This sudden scene had obviously left everyone completely dumbfounded.</p><p></p><p>A Transcendent Sovereign Prodigy? What the hell?</p><p></p><p>What was even more terrifying to the crowd was that they didn't even see clearly before they saw the Blood Demon Sect Master flying backward.</p><p></p><p>Liu Tu, Fu Liangcai, and Liu Qing had their mouths wide open, dumbfounded. They realized they had underestimated Senior Qingyi.</p><p></p><p>This "Late Divine Yang Realm"... it was all a lie!</p><p></p><p>How could someone in the Late Divine Yang Realm knock back a Mid Divine Pavilion Realm cultivator with a single move?</p><p></p><p>"Cough, cough, cough..."</p><p></p><p>The Blood Demon Sect Master shakily got up from the ground, his gaze extremely grave as he looked at the mysterious Qingyi in front of him.</p><p></p><p>He thought he had just been careless and ambushed, but this mysterious Qingyi was clearly at least on par with him, or even a top expert in the Late Divine Pavilion Realm!</p><p></p><p>"Who are you..." the Blood Demon Sect Master asked hoarsely.</p><p></p><p>At the same time, the Duan Jiuxiong and the Shadow Killing Pavilion Master also had their bodies stiffen slightly.</p><p></p><p>After all, Qingyi was standing right next to them.</p><p></p><p>Including the two of them, no one in such close proximity had clearly seen how Qingyi had moved just now.</p><p></p><p>Duan Jiuxiong had a very deep impression of Lu Changsheng, as he was the only Transcendent Sovereign Prodigy...</p><p></p><p>He had already guessed that this "Transcendent Sovereign Prodigy" Lu Changsheng was no simple matter, but he didn't expect him to be this extraordinary!</p><p></p><p>To actually possess the strength to repel the Blood Demon Sect Master!!</p><p></p><p>This is a Transcendent Sovereign Prodigy?</p><p></p><p>"Sir," Li Shuoyan respectfully greeted.</p><p></p><p>"Mm," Lu Changsheng lightly nodded.</p><p></p><p>The crowd present then understood the meaning behind Li Shuoyan's previous words "I am this sir's attendant."</p><p></p><p>Ah, it made a lot of sense now. Li Shuoyan, this top-tier Transcendent Sovereign Prodigy who could fight beyond his level, must have a powerful backer behind him.</p><p></p><p>However, the crowd could only speculate that the mysterious Qingyi and Li Shuoyan were probably not local to the Ancient Wasteland.</p><p></p><p>The Blood Demon Sect Master saw that the mysterious Qingyi was ignoring him, and after the previous events, he knew today's matter would be difficult to resolve peacefully. So, he steeled his heart, glanced at the Shadow Killing Pavilion Master behind Lu Changsheng, and subtly signaled him.</p><p></p><p>The Shadow Killing Pavilion Master's gaze wavered, and he slightly lowered his head. A palm slowly clenched in his sleeve, and a wisp of black mist gradually rose in his palm...</p><p></p><p>Lu Changsheng stood quietly, as if oblivious to everything.</p><p></p><p>"Haha, fellow Daoist, that was just a misunderstanding earlier, and it was this Sect Master who lost his calm..." </p><p></p><p>The Blood Demon Sect Master suddenly erupted! The two Divine Pavilion Realm cultivations behind him began to violently tremble!!</p><p></p><p>At the same time, the Shadow Killing Pavilion Master behind Lu Changsheng also abruptly struck a palm towards Lu Changsheng's back!!</p><p></p><p>This was an attempt to ambush Lu Changsheng!!</p><p></p><p>This scene left everyone unable to react in time!</p><p></p><p>Blood Demon Moon's eyes flashed, and she suddenly vanished from her seat!</p><p></p><p>But it was too late!</p><p></p><p>The next moment, a dull explosion resounded!</p><p></p><p>"Boomâ€”"</p><p></p><p>The crowd hurriedly looked over, and their expressions immediately froze.</p><p></p><p>Blood Demon Moon appeared in the center, also frozen in place.</p><p></p><p>At this moment, the Blood Demon Sect Master and the Shadow Killing Pavilion Master's faces were deathly pale, drenched in cold sweat.</p><p></p><p>Their spiritual souls were trembling uncontrollably!</p><p></p><p>How... how was this possible...</p><p></p><p>One had their fist slammed into Lu Changsheng's chest, and the other had their palm striking Lu Changsheng's back. </p><p></p><p>They remained in this position, daring not to move a muscle.</p><p></p><p>Duan Jiuxiong and the others' faces were stiff, trembling as they looked at the unharmed Qingyi man.</p><p></p><p>Lu Changsheng slightly lowered his gaze, looking at the two whose facial features were almost twisted together...</p><p></p><p>Here is the full English translation of the Chinese excerpt:</p><p></p><p>The Blood Demon Sect Master, with a calm expression, said, "Are you trying to tickle me?"</p><p></p><p>"Senior... senior..." The Blood Demon Sect Master's voice trembled.</p><p></p><p>The Shadow Killing Tower Master behind him deeply regretted it at this moment, fully aware that he had kicked a super iron plate.</p><p></p><p>"If you're not worthy of the opportunity, you can't blame me."</p><p></p><p>Lu Changsheng smiled slightly, and then his body shook lightly. The Blood Demon Sect Master and the Invisible Shadow were shattered into nothingness before the horrified and desperate eyes of the crowd.</p><p></p><p>The two top forces' masters were gone in such an absurd way.</p><p></p><p>Deathly silence fell over the entire venue!</p><p></p><p>"Sect Master..." </p><p>"Tower Master..."</p><p></p><p>The Evil Abyss and the Invisible Shadow from the Tea Discussion Conference were feeling dizzy, almost unable to stand steadily.</p><p></p><p>The scene that had just unfolded, they still couldn't believe they had witnessed it with their own eyes.</p><p></p><p>Their Sect Master and Tower Master were the top experts under the Ancient Wasteland Sword Clan, and now... they were dead!</p><p></p><p>"Master, should we eliminate these two forces?" </p><p></p><p>At this time, the Blood Demon Moon bowed and asked.</p><p></p><p>The crowd was shocked again, not expecting that even the mysterious Blood Moon ranked fifth was one of the young man in blue's people!</p><p></p><p>And the cold words of the Blood Moon made their scalps tingle.</p><p></p><p>Suddenly, two muffled, rapid explosion sounds rang out, startling the crowd. They looked towards the source.</p><p></p><p>Only to see that the Evil Abyss and the Invisible Shadow from the Tea Discussion Conference were gone, leaving only a pool of blood on the ground.</p><p></p><p>The Blood Demon Sect's Holy Son and the Shadow Killing Tower's Young Master had also... died.</p><p></p><p>Without any warning!</p><p></p><p>No one saw who struck them, but the crowd knew who it was... their hearts filled with even greater fear.</p><p></p><p>The entire square was thoroughly permeated with a sense of panic.</p><p></p><p>Everyone was afraid that the next bizarre explosion would be them.</p><p></p><p>Even the Elders of the Nangong Clan and the Li Clan, top forces, were now shaking.</p><p></p><p>Zhou Zhenjiang was about to faint. Not long ago, he had told his son that he was preparing to make a move on that bald man and seize the Refining Body Cultivation Art. Who knew the man behind it was so powerful!</p><p></p><p>In the venue,</p><p></p><p>Lu Changsheng turned around and looked at the Blood Demon Moon, calmly asking, "Am I really that cruel to eliminate these two forces?"</p><p></p><p>The Blood Demon Moon hesitated, then lowered his head and softly said, "It was Demon Moon's mistake in speaking. Of course, the master is kind-hearted."</p><p></p><p>The crowd stood in the wind, in disarray.</p><p></p><p>"Senior..."</p><p></p><p>Duan Jiuxiong bowed and tremblingly asked for instructions.</p><p></p><p>In response, the crowd took a deep breath and slightly bowed their heads. </p><p></p><p>At this moment, the mysterious young man in front of them was undoubtedly the absolute ruler of this place!</p><p></p><p>Lu Changsheng glanced at Duan Jiuxiong, then swept his gaze over the audience and the Tea Discussion Conference participants, and said indifferently:</p><p></p><p>"The Tea Discussion Conference will proceed as usual. I only want the tenth spot. Any problems?"</p><p></p><p>Although the crowd was perplexed, they quickly shook their heads in unison, like shaking a rattle drum!</p><p></p><p>No problem, of course there was no problem!</p><p></p><p>"Also, if anyone from the Ancient Wasteland Sword Clan dares to speak up when they arrive, every single one of you here will be killed."</p><p></p><p>Lu Changsheng said leisurely, his tone calm yet making the crowd feel as if they had fallen into the depths of winter.</p><p></p><p>"Senior, don't worry! If anyone dares to speak up, I, Duan Jiuxiong, will kill their entire family first!!"</p><p></p><p>Duan Jiuxiong was drenched in cold sweat as he repeatedly bowed in guarantee.</p><p></p><p>The Elders of the Nangong Clan and others also nodded continuously. After witnessing the deaths of the Blood Demon Sect Master and the others, who would dare to cause trouble.</p><p></p><p>Absolute power meant absolute authority!</p><p></p><p>Miao Hantian's eyes darted, and he quickly waved, inviting Lu Changsheng to the audience seats: "Sir, standing must be tiring. Please go with Mr. Miao to the audience seats to watch the Tea Discussion Conference."</p>

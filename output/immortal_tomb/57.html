        <h1>Chapter 57</h1>
        <div class="content">
            <p>Here is my translation of the Chinese excerpt:</p><p></p><p>Boom!</p><p></p><p>Lightning struck the mountain peak, but it did not hit the Ancient Crane Forest. </p><p></p><p>This lightning bolt was not the tribulation of the Ancient Crane Forest, but rather it was caused by Lu Changsheng being startled and losing control.</p><p></p><p>Lu Changsheng looked at the increasingly gathering tribulation clouds in the sky, and then turned his head to look at the Ancient Crane Forest, saying softly,</p><p></p><p>"Why are you still spacing out? The Nascent Soul tribulation is about to come."</p><p></p><p>"Ah, yes, yes, Master... Then the Crane Forest will go first."</p><p></p><p>The Ancient Crane Forest respectfully looked at Lu Changsheng, shook the messy thoughts in his head, and with a tap of his toes, flew up into the air, standing in midair.</p><p></p><p>He looked up at the tribulation clouds, his expression becoming solemn.</p><p></p><p>"Master, this little Heavenly Dao is afraid, thinking that this Ancient Crane Forest is closely related to you, so it specially sent down the Forty-Nine Heavenly Tribulation to please you, haha."</p><p></p><p>The old turtle looked up at the sky and laughed.</p><p></p><p>The Forty-Nine Heavenly Tribulation has four waves, each with nine bolts, a total of thirty-six bolts. </p><p></p><p>One wave is more terrifying than the last.</p><p></p><p>The Forty-Nine Heavenly Tribulation usually only appears when Nascent Soul cultivators break through, and under Lu Changsheng's influence, the Ancient Crane Forest's Gold Core breakthrough to Nascent Soul has caused this...</p><p></p><p>Whether it is a blessing or a curse, he does not know.</p><p></p><p>If he can ultimately withstand this Forty-Nine Heavenly Tribulation, he will benefit greatly.</p><p></p><p>Lu Changsheng couldn't be bothered to respond to the old turtle, he just stood with his hands behind his back, quietly looking up.</p><p></p><p>At the same time,</p><p></p><p>The tribulation clouds gathered more and more, the lightning crackling, as if it were the end of the world!</p><p></p><p>Even Chen Dadao and the steward on the distant city wall were dumbfounded, a sense of fear welling up in their hearts.</p><p></p><p>"Lord, there seems to be a figure standing in midair under that terrifying thunder cloud."</p><p></p><p>The steward pointed in that direction, squinting his eyes.</p><p></p><p>The distance was far, but the naked eye could still see it clearly, especially under the pitch-black tribulation clouds, the figure of the Ancient Crane Forest stood out particularly prominently.</p><p></p><p>"That's right, that should be the Immortal Crane. Weathering the tribulation, weathering the tribulation, it seems becoming an Immortal is not that easy after all." Chen Dadao sighed.</p><p></p><p>The steward tilted his head curiously, "But didn't the Master always seem quite carefree?"</p><p></p><p>Chen Dadao: "..."</p><p></p><p>...</p><p></p><p>Rumble rumble...</p><p></p><p>The Ancient Crane Forest looked at the tribulation clouds in the sky, his face as ugly as if he had eaten shit!</p><p></p><p>The Forty-Nine Heavenly Tribulation!</p><p></p><p>It shouldn't be, his natural talent, although not bad, but it's not to the point where his Gold Core breakthrough to Nascent Soul would trigger the Forty-Nine Heavenly Tribulation, right?</p><p></p><p>Facing the Forty-Nine Heavenly Tribulation, the Ancient Crane Forest suddenly lost some confidence.</p><p></p><p>The various tribulation-weathering methods he had prepared before may not be enough...</p><p></p><p>Rumble rumble...</p><p></p><p>At this time, the tribulation clouds began to roll violently, heralding the arrival of the first wave of tribulation!</p><p></p><p>And the Ancient Crane Forest also felt that he had been completely locked on!</p><p></p><p>He took a light breath, his eyes becoming as sharp as a hawk's.</p><p></p><p>The first wave, he chose to resist head-on!!</p><p></p><p>Otherwise, he would not be able to withstand the next three waves at all!</p><p></p><p>Rumble rumble! Crack!</p><p></p><p>Suddenly, nine bolts of lightning as thick as fingers, shimmering in a pale gold color, intertwined and struck down!</p><p></p><p>The Ancient Crane Forest's eyes narrowed, and he frantically mobilized the abundant spiritual energy in his body, even the Gold Core in his abdomen was trembling!</p><p></p><p>A thick spiritual energy barrier enveloped his body, and he did not retreat but advanced, rushing towards the nine lightning bolts!</p><p></p><p>In just a moment, the spiritual energy barrier dissipated, and the nine lightning bolts struck him.</p><p></p><p>Emitting dazzling light and the smell of scorched black smoke,</p><p></p><p>The Ancient Crane Forest's face turned pale, and he fell from the sky.</p><p></p><p>Just as he was about to hit the ground, he forcibly stabilized his body, blood seeping from the corners of his mouth.</p><p></p><p>He looked inside at the slightly cracked Gold Core in his abdomen, but there was not a trace of joy.</p><p></p><p>He then flipped his palm, put a few medicinal pills in his mouth, wiped the blood at the corner of his mouth, and soared back into the sky.</p><p></p><p>"Master, judging from the situation, it seems he may have a hard time."</p><p></p><p>Here is the full English translation of the Chinese excerpt:</p><p></p><p>The old turtle shook his head and laughed.</p><p></p><p>"The new 99 book can be found at 99shux.com."</p><p></p><p>Lu Changsheng moved his mouth, spitting out the date pit in his mouth, then tossed in another one, continuing to eat and observe.</p><p></p><p>In the sky, the ancient crane Linlei was panting heavily, exhausted.</p><p></p><p>He looked at the rolling storm clouds, knowing that the second wave of thunder tribulation was about to arrive.</p><p></p><p>"They really don't give one a chance to catch a breath, do they..."</p><p></p><p>Rumble! Crack!</p><p></p><p>Suddenly, nine streaks of faintly golden lightning, each as thick as three fingers, descended from the sky.</p><p></p><p>Linlei lowered his head to look at the armor on his chest, gritted his teeth, and forcefully injected his spiritual energy into it!</p><p></p><p>Then... he charged forward again!</p><p></p><p>In an instant, the nine bolts of lightning connected with him...</p><p></p><p>Sizzle! Sizzle! Sizzle!</p><p></p><p>The armor on his chest erupted in a brilliant light, completely enveloping Linlei.</p><p></p><p>But in just a few breaths, the armor was shattered to pieces.</p><p></p><p>The lightning struck Linlei's body, and he only felt his mind go blank before plummeting down from the high sky again.</p><p></p><p>- Boom!</p><p></p><p>If the old turtle hadn't gently caught him, he would have died in this second wave, and it would have been from the fall...</p><p></p><p>"Pah!"</p><p></p><p>Linlei violently coughed up a mouthful of fresh blood, his expression somewhat wilted, his entire body disheveled and tattered, his clothes in rags, his entire person blackened by the tribulation lightning.</p><p></p><p>His previous immortal bearing had been completely swept away under the terrifying thunder tribulation.</p><p></p><p>Today, in facing the tribulation, he had left Tongxin and Lindong behind at the Zhenzhu Manor, precisely because he had considered this.</p><p></p><p>Linlei laboriously took out a medicinal pill, not caring what it was, and forcefully swallowed it down, his complexion gradually improving somewhat.</p><p></p><p>But before he could even think, the storm clouds in the sky rolled and became even more violent!</p><p></p><p>Linlei's heart jumped, and he quickly rose up into the air.</p><p></p><p>Gritting his teeth, a battle flag appeared in his hand, and he waved it fiercely.</p><p></p><p>"Formation, arise!"</p><p></p><p>Hum hum hum!</p><p></p><p>The battle flags Linlei had previously set up below began to vibrate violently, and beams of light shot out from thirty-six directions, connecting in the sky to form a light shield.</p><p></p><p>A sense of indestructibility floated upon it, making it clear that this was the defensive formation Linlei had prepared earlier to withstand the thunder tribulation.</p><p></p><p>Rumble rumble!!</p><p></p><p>Nine bolts of lightning, each as thick as a forearm, ruthlessly descended!</p><p></p><p>Linlei's pupils contracted, feeling that under this overwhelming divine might, he would be reduced to ashes in the next moment!</p><p></p><p>The power and divine might they carried were too immense, and this was only the third wave!</p><p></p><p>The nine bolts of lightning struck the formation in an instant!</p><p></p><p>The battle flag in Linlei's hand snapped with a crack, and the thirty-six formation flags below also broke one after another.</p><p></p><p>The formation dissipated, and the tribulation lightning surged towards Linlei!</p><p></p><p>"Master!"</p><p></p><p>In the distance, on the city wall, Tongxin and Lindong saw this and were greatly alarmed.</p><p></p><p>Just now, they had heard the increasingly loud thunderclaps and could no longer resist, disobeying their master's orders to come out.</p><p></p><p>Chen Dadao and the steward were also deathly pale. They had never seen such terrifying lightning.</p><p></p><p>Even without being in the midst of it, they could feel the world-destroying power of those nine tribulation bolts.</p><p></p><p>It was unimaginable what would become of the immortal cultivator struck by them.</p><p></p><p>Their hearts were gripped with dread.</p><p></p><p>At the same time, in a distant place, vast black mists were billowing.</p><p></p><p>"Hehe, very good, I can sense the Abyss Demon Spear is in that direction," Zhao Shenyuan had just said when he heard the distant thunder. His eyes flickered, and he disappeared from the spot.</p><p></p><p>The next moment, he appeared in the sky.</p><p></p><p>He looked over, his gaze slightly solemn.</p><p></p><p>"The Forty-Nine Heavenly Tribulation? Could it be that there is a Transcendent cultivator undergoing tribulation?"</p><p></p><p>Then a mocking smile curved his lips. "How fortuitous, arriving just in time."</p><p></p><p>He waved his hand towards the black mists below.</p><p></p><p>"Come, follow me!"</p>

        <h1>Chapter 210</h1>
        <div class="content">
            <p>Here is the full English translation of the Chinese excerpt:</p><p></p><p>Seeing this, ‚ò¢üê†6‚ùæ≈úùìó‚ì§À£.‚ìíœÉ‚ìúüéâüèÜ</p><p></p><p>Lu Changsheng nodded slightly and sat down in the remaining empty seat.</p><p></p><p>Zhao Ran and the other two had their gazes fixed on the colorful crystal stones on the table. Although their eyes were filled with envy, there was also a hint of conflict and hesitation.</p><p></p><p>Someone who could casually take out so many colorful spirit stones to buy a seat, and who could casually compare the precious colorful spirit stones to ordinary stones... their identity and background must not be simple.</p><p></p><p>Their eyes flickered, struggling for a moment, but in the end, they sighed.</p><p></p><p>"Senior, we shall take our leave." Zhao Ran bowed and was about to lead his two junior disciples away.</p><p></p><p>"Wait." Lu Changsheng called out to them.</p><p></p><p>Zhao Ran and the others were startled, their hearts filled with panic as they tried to recall if they had offended this senior in any way. They quickly turned around and bowed deeply.</p><p></p><p>Lu Changsheng smiled, "No need to be nervous, I just wanted to say, the stones on the table, you can take them."</p><p></p><p>Zhao Ran felt relieved, "Senior, we..."</p><p></p><p>"This is a transaction, and since it is a transaction, then they are rightfully yours."</p><p></p><p>Lu Changsheng finished speaking, and the colorful spirit stones on the table flew up and hovered in front of Zhao Ran and the others.</p><p></p><p>Zhao Ran was stunned, while the two junior disciples behind her had a joyful look in their eyes, but then they became anxious and sent a voice transmission:</p><p></p><p>"Sister, quickly take them! Take them!! The senior has said they are for us!"</p><p></p><p>"Yes, sister, you must take them today! If you don't, it would be disrespectful to the senior!!"</p><p></p><p>Zhao Ran turned and glared at the two of them.</p><p></p><p>Then, under their hopeful gaze, she collected the colorful spirit stones. Finally, she looked at Lu Changsheng deeply, bowed, and said, "Then we thank the senior for the gift. We shall take our leave."</p><p></p><p>After Lu Changsheng nodded, Zhao Ran led the two excited junior disciples and quickly left the restaurant.</p><p></p><p>Lu Changsheng looked out the window at the sea of people and called out, "Little Two."</p><p></p><p>"Coming, sir! Just a moment, please wait!" One of the waiters hurriedly responded. He was busy with his tasks, running back and forth, responding to Lu Changsheng.</p><p></p><p>The other waiters were also busy, running up and down, back and forth.</p><p></p><p>The owner behind the counter watched the scene, both delighted and exasperated, as they were a bit short-handed.</p><p></p><p>He then came over to Lu Changsheng and smiled, "Sir, what do you need?"</p><p></p><p>Lu Changsheng continued looking out the window and said softly, "Bring me a pot of your restaurant's signature wine, and a random appetizer dish."</p><p></p><p>"Certainly, sir. Please wait a moment." The owner looked Lu Changsheng over and then turned to prepare the order.</p><p></p><p>At this time, two familiar figures appeared on the street outside the restaurant.</p><p></p><p>"Elder brother, we've played enough. Let's hurry back and focus on cultivation in the last three days."</p><p></p><p>Lin Dong looked at the excited and lively expression on Tong Xin's face and sighed helplessly.</p><p></p><p>Tong Xin, however, shook his head and glanced at Lin Dong, saying, "Elder brother, you really are a cultivation fanatic. What can you possibly cultivate in the last three days? It's better to relax and unwind. I'm not criticizing you, but you know, cultivation requires a balance of diligence and leisure. Overdoing it is just as bad as not doing enough."</p><p></p><p>Lin Dong's mouth twitched, wanting to refute, but Tong Xin quickly waved his hand and interrupted, "Ah~ But those are the words our master said before. If you argue against it, you'd be arguing against our master's words, not me!"</p><p></p><p>Lin Dong was stunned. When it came to verbal skills, he was no match for the quick-witted Tong Xin.</p><p></p><p>He sighed helplessly and subconsciously looked around, then froze!</p><p></p><p>Huh??</p><p></p><p>"Elder brother, what's wrong with you? Ah, well, if you want to go back, I'll go with you." Tong Xin was about to leave, but noticed Lin Dong hadn't followed, so he turned back and shook his head.</p><p></p><p>Huh?</p><p></p><p>Here is the full English translation of the Chinese excerpt:</p><p></p><p>Lin Dong stood there like a wooden block, without any reaction, his gaze dull. Tong Xin couldn't help but feel puzzled.</p><p></p><p>She immediately waved her hand in front of his eyes, "Shidi? Shidi?"</p><p></p><p>Seeing this, Tong Xin grew suspicious and couldn't help but follow Lin Dong's line of sight, wanting to see what had captured his attention.</p><p></p><p>The next moment, Tong Xin's face turned deathly pale!</p><p></p><p>...</p><p></p><p>In the restaurant, Tong Xin and Lin Dong stood nervously in front of Lu Changsheng, their foreheads beaded with cold sweat.</p><p></p><p>Lin Dong was extremely afraid in his heart, and he couldn't help but glare at Tong Xin resentfully out of the corner of his eye, silently cursing his shixiong for getting him into such a predicament!</p><p></p><p>The battle beyond their level was approaching, and they had not cultivated properly, but instead came out to play. Wouldn't they be scolded by the master?</p><p></p><p>"Master... we didn't know you had also come to Jinglei City," Tong Xin said with some trepidation, his heart filled with fear at the moment.</p><p></p><p>Lin Dong: "......"</p><p></p><p>He hated it in his heart. Why did his shixiong have to blurt out nonsense in front of the master at this time?</p><p></p><p>However, Lu Changsheng smiled and said, "Sit down."</p><p></p><p>The two were stunned, not daring to disobey, and quickly sat down, their posture upright.</p><p></p><p>It's just that their uneasy gaze had nowhere to rest.</p><p></p><p>"Customers, the wine and dishes are here," the innkeeper came over at this time. He looked puzzled at Tong Xin and the others, then placed the wine and dishes on the table.</p><p></p><p>"Bring two more pots of wine and add a few more dishes," Lu Changsheng said to the innkeeper.</p><p></p><p>The innkeeper met his gaze and felt a chill in his heart for some reason. He quickly nodded and withdrew.</p><p></p><p>Tong Xin was quick-witted, abruptly standing up to pour the wine, arranging the wine cups neatly, and then began to pour wine for Lu Changsheng, completing the task swiftly and smoothly before sitting back down.</p><p></p><p>Lin Dong was stunned for a moment. Damn, his shixiong had already finished, but he hadn't even reacted yet. In this regard, he found himself far behind his shixiong.</p><p></p><p>Lu Changsheng picked up the wine cup, took a sip, and looked at Lin Dong with a smile, "Cultivation should be moderate, not too much or too little. Helu's words are not bad."</p><p></p><p>Lin Dong was ashamed and quickly responded respectfully, "Yes, Master."</p><p></p><p>Tong Xin's mouth curled up slightly. If the master in the distant Immortal Realm knew that he had been praised by the master, wouldn't he be excited and flailing his arms?</p><p></p><p>After a moment, the innkeeper brought the wine and dishes again, bowed slightly, and left.</p><p></p><p>At this time, Lu Changsheng suddenly flicked his fingers, and two streams of light entered Lin Dong and Tong Xin's sea of consciousness.</p><p></p><p>Lin Dong and Tong Xin were startled, quickly turning their attention inward. Soon, their expressions were filled with shock!</p><p></p><p>"All along, whether it was at the Longevity Restaurant or now at the Xiaoyao Sect, your performance has been quite satisfactory. Today, I will grant you each a technique," Lu Changsheng said softly.</p><p></p><p>"Thank you, Master!" Lin Dong and Tong Xin hurriedly stood up and deeply bowed.</p><p></p><p>They were shocked and also felt ashamed and anxious.</p><p></p><p>First the mysterious soup, and now techniques they couldn't understand... The master had given them too much, and they felt unworthy.</p><p></p><p>Lu Changsheng said indifferently, "In fact, that soup not only purified your constitution, but also laid the foundation for cultivating these two techniques."</p><p></p><p>Hearing this, Tong Xin and Lin Dong were greatly shaken!</p><p></p><p>So it was like this!</p><p></p><p>"There are less than three days before the battle beyond your level. It should be enough time for you to comprehend the basics of the techniques," Lu Changsheng said again.</p><p></p><p>Tong Xin and Lin Dong immediately became eager, also understanding Lu Changsheng's intention.</p><p></p><p>They hurriedly stood up and bowed, "Master, then we shall take our leave!"</p><p></p><p>Seeing Lu Changsheng nod, the two quickly turned around,</p><p></p><p>"Wait."</p><p></p><p>Huh? The two stopped in their tracks and hurriedly turned back, bowing down and waiting for Lu Changsheng's instructions.</p><p></p><p>Only to hear,</p><p></p><p>"Take your wine and dishes with you, I can't finish them all."</p>

        <h1>Chapter 179</h1>
        <div class="content">
            <p>Here is the full English translation of the Chinese excerpt:</p><p></p><p>The Qingxuan Town.</p><p></p><p>The weather was bright and sunny, with the warm sun shining down.</p><p></p><p>The deep crack in the sky above still remained, seemingly unchanging since ancient times, but the huge black hole that had been created by Lu Changsheng had disappeared, repaired by someone unknown.</p><p></p><p>Ever since the downfall of the Jiang Imperial Clan, the previously remote Qingxuan Town in the Heisha Domain had become extremely prominent.</p><p></p><p>Cultivators from all over, both from other towns in the Heisha Domain and from other realms of the Tianzhihen, flocked to Qingxuan Town daily.</p><p></p><p>Even the land in Qingxuan Town had become extremely valuable, with the areas closest to the Changsheng Inn being the most expensive. It was a seller's market with no buyers.</p><p></p><p>...</p><p></p><p>The Changsheng Inn.</p><p></p><p>Outside, many cultivators who had been assigned their turn waited quietly in line.</p><p></p><p>There were also many cultivators registering their names with Left Choushan to join the queue.</p><p></p><p>In fact, many of these cultivators were quite afraid to come to the Changsheng Inn, but since they couldn't drink the Xihun Liquor and Rumengjiu without coming, they gritted their teeth and came anyway, being careful not to cause any trouble, as the innkeeper was actually quite amiable.</p><p></p><p>Meanwhile, inside the inn.</p><p></p><p>Peng Fang, Su Qianghe, Yin Jiuguai, Zhao Wurou, and others were happily drinking.</p><p></p><p>"Ah, this is just the kind of thing I like. Nowadays, the inn has become so popular, it's as hard to get a drink as climbing to the heavens," Peng Fang sighed as he put down his cup.</p><p></p><p>"Hehe, Senior Peng speaks the truth. I, old Su, feel I may never be able to leave the innkeeper's wines for the rest of my life," Su Qianghe chuckled familiarly.</p><p></p><p>Yin Jiuguai and Zhao Wurou also nodded with smiles.</p><p></p><p>"You little rascal, come, have a drink!" Peng Fang raised his cup.</p><p></p><p>Seeing this, Su Qianghe and the others quickly raised their cups, clinking them together and downing the drinks.</p><p></p><p>Lately, Su Qianghe and the others had become quite familiar with Peng Fang, especially Su Qianghe, who loved alcohol and was on the same wavelength as Peng Fang.</p><p></p><p>Tongxin and Lin Dong, as usual, stood to the side, wearing polite yet slightly awkward smiles.</p><p></p><p>"Tongxin, Lin Dong, don't you two get tired standing there all day? Come, sit down and have a drink with us," Peng Fang waved them over with a smile.</p><p></p><p>"That's right, Little Brother Tong, Little Brother Lin, you should sit down and drink with us. We're all old friends now," the others also invited.</p><p></p><p>Tongxin and Lin Dong's hearts jumped at this, and they cautiously peeked out at the courtyard, where Lu Changsheng was sunbathing. They then hurriedly waved their hands, saying, "Ahem, esteemed guests, we'll have to decline."</p><p></p><p>Seeing this, Peng Fang immediately understood that Tongxin and Lin Dong were afraid of the reclining Lu Changsheng in the courtyard. He then deliberately spoke loudly and laughingly, "It's fine, the innkeeper's abilities are supreme, and he is extremely gentle, kind-hearted, and amiable. He would never bother with you two."</p><p></p><p>Lu Changsheng in the courtyard opened his eyes, shook his head, and chuckled softly, "You two, since the guests have invited you, then you should rest and join them."</p><p></p><p>Hearing the voice from the courtyard, everyone in the inn shuddered.</p><p></p><p>Tongxin and Lin Dong hurriedly bowed and said, "Yes," then happily came to sit down at Peng Fang's table.</p><p></p><p>"Hehe, good for you." Peng Fang winked at Su Qianghe and the others, meaning "Learn from this."</p><p></p><p>Su Qianghe and the others immediately showered praise, "Indeed, Senior Peng is the best. We have learned, we have learned..."</p><p></p><p>"Haha, Tongxin, Lin Dong, here." Peng Fang personally stood up to pour wine for the two of them.</p><p></p><p>This scene made everyone in the inn green with envy. What innkeeper's assistant could get a Sage Emperor-level expert to personally pour their wine? In the entire Tianzhihen, it was probably only at the Changsheng Inn.</p><p></p><p>Tongxin and Lin Dong were suddenly showered with favor, hastily cupping the wine with both hands. They couldn't help but think of the Baiyu Sect's Elder Gujue and Chen Dadao back in the Sifang Immortal Realm... If their sect master and senior brother knew they were by the Master's side, receiving the personal attention of a Sage Emperor-level expert, they would probably be green with envy to the point of madness.</p><p></p><p>What follows next...</p><p></p><p>Here is the full English translation of the Chinese excerpt:</p><p></p><p>The tavern was filled with merriment, as the two young waiters, Tongxin and Lindong, were continuously being toasted. Their faces had turned red from drinking.</p><p></p><p>After the third round of drinks, a hoarse voice suddenly sounded outside.</p><p></p><p>"The Holy Immortal Realm, the Patriarch of the Chen Clan, Chen Jiang, has specially come with the Chen Clan disciples to pay respects to Senior Lu!"</p><p></p><p>Huh? The Holy Immortal Realm? The Patriarch of the Chen Clan?! </p><p></p><p>The crowd instantly sobered up.</p><p></p><p>Tongxin and Lindong quickly activated their Immortal Qi to expel the alcohol from their bodies, their complexions rapidly returning to normal. They exchanged a glance and rushed outside.</p><p></p><p>Peng Fang's furrowed brows quickly relaxed. He knew the intention of the Chen Clan. This was clearly a panicked situation.</p><p></p><p>He also stood up and walked outside with Su Qianghe and the others, just as they had finished their drinks.</p><p></p><p>Outside the courtyard.</p><p></p><p>The crowd fell silent, staring in dumbfounded amazement at the group before them.</p><p></p><p>The Chen Clan...</p><p></p><p>The bowing elder in the lead was the Patriarch of the Chen Clan, Chen Jiang. Behind him, Chen Zhennan and a group of elders stood with bowed heads.</p><p></p><p>"Uh..." </p><p></p><p>As the gatekeeper of the Long Life Tavern, Zuo Youshan found this scene a bit overwhelming. The other cultivators felt the same way. </p><p></p><p>If not for their previous experience with the Jiang Clan, and the fact that this was the proprietor's domain, they might have knelt down in fear.</p><p></p><p>After all, this was an Imperial Clan. The proprietor, being the number one expert of the Heavenly Scar, could treat them as insignificant, but they could not.</p><p></p><p>The Chen Clan could crush them like ants.</p><p></p><p>At this moment, the voice of Lu Changsheng suddenly rang out in the courtyard.</p><p></p><p>"No need to see me, leave the gifts here. Tongxin, go collect the gifts."</p><p></p><p>The crowd was stunned.</p><p></p><p>But Chen Jiang and the others were overjoyed, heaving a huge sigh of relief! </p><p></p><p>Good, as long as he was willing to accept the gifts, they could sleep soundly tonight, even though they did not actually need sleep.</p><p></p><p>Under the curious gazes of the crowd, Tongxin stepped forward and extended his hand towards Chen Jiang.</p><p></p><p>Chen Jiang suddenly turned his head and glared at Chen Zhennan.</p><p></p><p>"Ah... Oops!" Chen Zhennan quickly snapped out of it and solemnly handed a ring to Tongxin.</p><p></p><p>Tongxin tightly grasped the ring and shyly retreated.</p><p></p><p>Seeing this, Chen Jiang bowed and said, "Senior Lu, Chen Jiang takes his leave. We cordially invite you to visit the Chen Clan anytime, and we will humbly listen to your teachings."</p><p></p><p>With no further sound from the courtyard, Chen Jiang visibly relaxed and left with Chen Zhennan and the others in a flash.</p><p></p><p>The crowd exchanged bewildered glances, their awe for the Long Life Tavern reaching an unprecedented level.</p><p></p><p>The proprietor was truly formidable, making the mighty Imperial Clan appear as obedient as children before him.</p><p></p><p>The Long Life Tavern soon regained its order.</p><p></p><p>...</p><p></p><p>"Sir," Tongxin bowed and presented the ring to Lu Changsheng.</p><p></p><p>Lu Changsheng opened his eyes and chuckled lightly, "Do you think I need this junk?"</p><p></p><p>Tongxin was taken aback, awkwardly scratching his head, "Of course not, sir..."</p><p></p><p>"The item inside this ring, you and Lindong can keep it for yourselves."</p><p></p><p>Lu Changsheng slowly rose from the rocking chair, looking down at the boy who only reached his chin, and said, "For the next period, you two will be in charge of managing the tavern. I need to go out and take care of some matters."</p><p></p><p>Tongxin bowed, "Sir, you can rest assured."</p><p></p><p>He did not ask further questions, knowing not to inquire about things he should not.</p><p></p><p>Satisfied, Lu Changsheng nodded, clasped his hands behind his back, and his figure gradually faded.</p><p></p><p>"Brother, where has the sir gone?" Lindong came running over.</p><p></p><p>Tongxin placed the ring in Lindong's hand and smiled, "The sir has gone out to take care of some matters. We must manage the tavern well in his absence."</p><p></p><p>"Oh," Lindong nodded blankly, looking at the ring in his hand, puzzled, "Brother, isn't this the gift the Chen Clan gave to the sir? Haven't you given it to him yet?"</p><p></p><p>Tongxin paused, awkwardly scratching his head, "The sir said he doesn't need this junk, so he left it for us."</p><p></p><p>Lindong: "Huh? Junk...?"</p><p></p><p>At the same time, in the sky outside Qingxuan Town.</p><p></p><p>Xing Tian saw Lu Changsheng appear and his eyes lit up with joy, quickly bowing in greeting.</p><p></p><p>"Senior Lu, Xing Tian has been waiting for you for a long time."</p><p></p><p>Lu Changsheng gave him a sidelong glance.</p><p></p><p>"Let's go, to see your daughter."</p>

        <h1>Chapter 523</h1>
        <div class="content">
            <p>Here is the full English translation of the Chinese excerpt:</p><p></p><p>Huang Yulang hurriedly called the madam and pointed to the gold coins on the table, asking what was going on!</p><p></p><p>The madam smiled bitterly and said, "Boss, Mr. Lu said that he would cover all the expenses at Qiuqing Pavilion tonight."</p><p></p><p>Huang Yulang's expression darkened as he picked up the gold coins.</p><p></p><p>"All expenses are waived tonight, and in the future, Mr. Lu is not to be charged when he comes here. As the madam, how could you not have seen this?" </p><p></p><p>After saying this, Huang Yulang angrily went downstairs, leaving the madam behind to regret, as she had been too busy to think much, only wanting Mr. Lu to be happy.</p><p></p><p>...</p><p></p><p>The next morning.</p><p></p><p>The students yawned as they gradually entered the study hall, carrying their book bags. </p><p></p><p>Everyone came to school on their own, as required by Mr. Lu.</p><p></p><p>But today, Huang Xuan was led by the hand by Huang Yulang.</p><p></p><p>Huang Xuan was puzzled, wondering why his father had come with him to the teacher's class.</p><p></p><p>When Huang Yulang entered the study hall and saw Mr. Lu, he hurriedly took out the gold coins and offered them with both hands, smiling bitterly:</p><p></p><p>"Mr. Lu, how dare I accept your money? This is too much for me..."</p><p></p><p>Mr. Lu simply said, "Do I need that little money?" and dismissed Huang Yulang.</p><p></p><p>Huang Yulang did not dare to insist, glaring angrily at Huang Xuan before leaving, leaving the bewildered Huang Xuan behind.</p><p></p><p>...</p><p></p><p>In the study hall.</p><p></p><p>"Morning is the best time for memory, so you shall recite the Three-Character Classic. When you can recite the entire text, I will take you to see a different world."</p><p></p><p>"Alright, you can start reciting, I'm going to have breakfast."</p><p></p><p>Mr. Lu said this indifferently and then walked out of the classroom.</p><p></p><p>The students had already gotten used to this after half a month. </p><p></p><p>The teacher would leave to have breakfast every day, then have them recite the Three-Character Classic. </p><p></p><p>This time, the teacher had promised to show them a different world if they could recite the full text. Yesterday, he had told them stories if they could recite the first half.</p><p></p><p>What could this different world be?</p><p></p><p>"Man at birth is good by nature.</p><p>Though their natures are similar, their habits differ.</p><p>If not taught, the nature will deteriorate.</p><p>The way of teaching values focus."</p><p></p><p>Soon, the sound of recitation filled the study hall.</p><p></p><p>Meanwhile, Mr. Lu was enjoying his steamed buns and hot porridge on the street, paid the bill, and then returned to the study hall.</p><p></p><p>When he came back, the morning recitation had just finished, and the timing was as precise as always.</p><p></p><p>This is the life of a retiree.</p><p></p><p>Mr. Lu knew there were a few rivers near Jixiang Town, and he planned to go fishing in a couple of days after class, to make use of his free time.</p><p></p><p>In the classroom.</p><p></p><p>Han Yue and Huang Xuan sat up straight, ready to listen to Mr. Lu's lesson.</p><p></p><p>But Mr. Lu just took a sip of tea and waved his hand, smiling: "Everyone, relax. How's the recitation of the Three-Character Classic going?"</p><p></p><p>"Teacher, in two more days, Huang Xuan will be able to recite the full text!"</p><p></p><p>"I can do it in three days!"</p><p></p><p>"I can do it in four days!"</p><p></p><p>"......"</p><p></p><p>"I... I estimate it will take me half a month, teacher......"</p><p></p><p>The last one to raise his hand was Han Yue, his face full of embarrassment.</p><p></p><p>But this time, the others did not mock Han Yue, but instead looked at him encouragingly.</p><p></p><p>After school yesterday, they had all gone to Han Yue's home outside Jixiang Town and seen the situation of his family.</p><p></p><p>Han Yue's family lived in a small mountain village with very difficult living conditions.</p><p></p><p>Han Yue had to work every day, doing those tough physical tasks. Yesterday, Huang Xuan and the others had experienced it themselves, and it was truly exhausting and dirty.</p><p></p><p>Especially for Huang Xuan, a young master used to a life of luxury, the scene made him pinch his nose in discomfort - it was really smelly. But later, he still forced himself to help Han Yue for a while.</p><p></p><p>For someone of Huang Xuan's family background, just having the courage to work for a while was already quite remarkable.</p><p></p><p>If Huang Xuan had not visited Han Yue's home, he would never have known how poor the poor could be.</p><p></p><p>In the past, Huang Xuan would have...</p><p></p><p>Here is my translation of the Chinese excerpt:</p><p></p><p>This kind of person does not deserve to be looked down upon, or even stepped on, but after the teacher's teachings yesterday, Huang Xuan will not do that anymore.</p><p></p><p>Because the teacher was right, one cannot only see the shortcomings of others, but must also see their strengths.</p><p></p><p>Although Han Yue's family circumstances are poor, his perseverance and ability to endure hardship are truly admirable to them.</p><p></p><p>Lu Changsheng looked at the expressions of Huang Xuan and the others, and suddenly said with interest, "Did you all also go to Han Yue's house after school yesterday? What insights did you gain? Huang Xuan, you speak first."</p><p></p><p>Huang Xuan, who was called upon, was startled for a moment, then stood up and replied carefully:</p><p></p><p>"Teacher, if the students had not gone to Han Yue's house yesterday, they would not have known that there are such impoverished families in the world, nor would they have seen Han Yue's spirit of enduring hardship. The teacher is right, we cannot be narrow-minded and mock Han Yue, but should take him as an example. His spirit of enduring hardship is worthy of our learning and praise!"</p><p></p><p>The students all nodded in agreement. Although their family circumstances were not as good as Huang Xuan's, they were still much better off than Han Yue's.</p><p></p><p>At this time, Han Yue deeply lowered his head, feeling inferior in his heart.</p><p></p><p>Huang Xuan thought his words would be praised by Lu Changsheng, but Lu Changsheng said indifferently:</p><p></p><p>"You said that the spirit of enduring hardship is worthy of learning, that's correct, but it should not be celebrated or praised."</p><p></p><p>"Since you have seen Han Yue's family circumstances, you should work harder, because your starting point is much better than Han Yue's."</p><p></p><p>Huang Xuan's heart trembled, and he lowered his head: "I will remember the teacher's teachings."</p><p></p><p>Lu Changsheng looked at the silent Han Yue and called out, "Han Yue."</p><p></p><p>"Teacher, the student is here!"</p><p></p><p>Han Yue was startled and quickly stood up.</p><p></p><p>"You don't need to feel inferior either. You must know that people are not born equal."</p><p></p><p>Lu Changsheng said.</p><p></p><p>"But in my Changsheng Academy, everyone is equal. Huang Xuan and the others are not nobler than you in any way. Their illustrious family background and solid family circumstances are completely useless here."</p><p></p><p>"I have money, a lot of money, but I won't help you. No one in the world will help you either. Everything still needs to rely on yourself, what you earn yourself is the true."</p><p></p><p>"In the past, it may have been difficult, but from the moment you entered the Changsheng Academy, anything is possible."</p><p></p><p>Han Yue's heart trembled, and he bowed: "Yes!"</p><p></p><p>Han Yue was grateful in his heart. He wanted to say, "Teacher, the fact that you let me come to your school is the greatest help already..."</p><p></p><p>Lu Changsheng smiled slightly, "In my school, everything is based on academic performance. Look at Huang Xuan's father Huang Yulang, he is the head of the Huang clan in the town, but his son Huang Xuan does not get any special privileges here."</p><p></p><p>Hearing this, Huang Xuan's face flushed. He wanted to say that the teacher was downplaying it, as this was far from not having any special privileges at all. His father had to watch the teacher's face and carefully serve him.</p><p></p><p>As a young master, Huang Xuan naturally understood very well. His teacher was extremely mysterious, which was also the reason why he dared not be reckless at all.</p><p></p><p>If it were other schools in the town, the teacher's face would not matter to him at all! His father had also said that if he dared to be reckless in the Changsheng Academy and upset the teacher, he wouldn't even need the teacher to use the cane, his father would personally break his limbs... Thinking about his father's serious expression at the time, Huang Xuan trembled in his heart.</p><p></p><p>"Hehe."</p><p></p><p>Lu Changsheng smiled and waved his hand, signaling for Han Yue and Huang Xuan to sit down. His gaze swept over the students, finally resting on Han Yue, and he said slowly,</p><p></p><p>"Why did I say that everything is possible after entering my Changsheng Academy? Have you heard of 'Book and Martial Arts, Heavenly Dao'? Book and martial arts coexist, the book, using words to attack and defeat the enemy, have you heard of this?"</p><p></p><p>As soon as he finished speaking, the students' eyes suddenly lit up!</p><p></p><p>Han Yue's breathing also quickened!</p><p></p><p>...</p><p></p><p>Please keep up the good work! I'm looking forward to the next update.</p>

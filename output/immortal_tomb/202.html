        <h1>Chapter 202</h1>
        <div class="content">
            <p>Here is the full English translation of the Chinese excerpt:</p><p></p><p>Zuo Chou, Shan, and the three were startled. 69§hµx.¢ðm</p><p></p><p>They quickly composed their expressions, and Su Qianghe coughed dryly, "Nothing, we were just recalling some unpleasant past events."</p><p></p><p>"That's right, unpleasant past events," Zuo Chou and Zhao Wuyou hurriedly nodded in agreement.</p><p></p><p>Yin Jiuguai saw this and became even more suspicious. "Unpleasant past events? You three were all recalling unpleasant past events together??"</p><p></p><p>The three nodded: "Yes, yes, yes!"</p><p></p><p>Yin Jiuguai frowned, he always felt that something was off, but he had no clue, so he impatiently shook his head, not wanting to think about it anymore.</p><p></p><p>At this time, Peng Fang's eyes rolled, and he stood up, patting his butt and laughing, "You guys keep chatting, keep an eye on the disciples, I'm going to the restroom."</p><p></p><p>Seeing the few people agree, Peng Fang left with a satisfied nod.</p><p></p><p>After Peng Fang left...</p><p></p><p>"I feel that the Grand Elder is a bit off," Su Qianghe suddenly stared at the direction Peng Fang had left and said.</p><p></p><p>Zuo Chou, Shan, and the three: "?"</p><p></p><p>What's off?</p><p></p><p>Seeing this, Su Qianghe leaned in and whispered, "You see, the Sect Master usually directly conveys matters to the Grand Elder, right?"</p><p></p><p>"Yeah, but what's the problem with that?" The three were puzzled.</p><p></p><p>"How is there no problem? There's a big problem!" Su Qianghe excitedly said, "I've actually been suspicious of the Grand Elder for a long time!"</p><p></p><p>The three: "Ah?"</p><p></p><p>Zuo Chou stared at Su Qianghe and shouted, "Third Elder, you can't say such things casually!! The Grand Elder, like us, has been following the Sect Master from the Heavenly Scar all along!"</p><p></p><p>Yin Jiuguai and Zhao Wuyou also had serious expressions.</p><p></p><p>Some things without evidence should not be said casually.</p><p></p><p>Su Qianghe was taken aback, but then affirmed, "Although I don't have any evidence, I believe the Grand Elder must have done something!"</p><p></p><p>Zuo Chou's expression changed, and he immediately covered Su Qianghe's mouth and growled, "Do you want to die?! If the Grand Elder hears this, and the Sect Master is not here, who can protect you?"</p><p></p><p>Yin Jiuguai said in a deep voice, "That's right, Third Elder, let's wait until after the great competition before saying anything. Then we'll go to the Sect Master."</p><p></p><p>Su Qianghe was dazed, pushing away Zuo Chou's hand, and said resentfully, "It was the Grand Elder's fault in the first place, and you won't even let me say it? Second Elder, Fourth Elder, Fifth Elder, the Grand Elder has damaged our four people's interests!!!"</p><p></p><p>Huh? Damaged their interests?</p><p></p><p>Zuo Chou, Shan, and the three were stunned, realizing that this matter had deviated from what they had imagined.</p><p></p><p>Could it be not as they had imagined?</p><p></p><p>Su Qianghe hurriedly said, "I'll just say it directly, the Grand Elder must have hidden the wine! Perhaps the portion the Sect Master gave us four has been hidden by him!"</p><p></p><p>"All these years, how could the Sect Master have only given us a jar of Xixian Liquor two and a half years ago??"</p><p></p><p>Zuo Chou, Shan, and the three were taken aback, and let out a sigh of relief.</p><p></p><p>It turned out that Su Qianghe was talking about this matter, they had thought the Grand Elder had betrayed the sect or done something that harmed the sect's interests, scaring them to death.</p><p></p><p>Ah, that's not right!!</p><p></p><p>The Grand Elder had swallowed their wine!!</p><p></p><p>Zuo Chou and Zhao Wuyou had not yet spoken, when Yin Jiuguai suddenly said in a gloomy expression, "Good, you guys, so it turns out the Sect Master gave us a jar of Xixian Liquor two and a half years ago, then where's my share? Hand it over!"</p><p></p><p>As he spoke, he abruptly stretched out his palm, wanting to get back his own share!</p><p></p><p>"Uh..." Zuo Chou, Shan, and the three had embarrassed expressions.</p><p></p><p>It had been two and a half years ago... the wine had long been drunk, where would they still have it?</p><p></p><p>Thinking of this, Zuo Chou and Zhao Wuyou couldn't help but blame Su Qianghe, really, speaking without considering the occasion.</p><p></p><p>"Hehe, Fourth Elder, your share... that share..." Su Qianghe scratched his head, stammering, finally could only laugh awkwardly, "We accidentally drank it for you..."</p><p></p><p>Fuck your "accidentally"!</p><p></p><p>Yin Jiuguai was struck by lightning.</p><p></p><p>Here is the full English translation of the Chinese excerpt:</p><p></p><p>His entire being had lost its vitality. </p><p></p><p>He hated how naive he had been.</p><p></p><p>For the past period of time, he had been staying in the registration hall every day, frequently asking them if the Sect Master had distributed the wine yet. They all responded with righteous indignation, their faces full of regret, saying there was none.</p><p></p><p>What was infuriating was that he had believed their lies every single time!</p><p></p><p>Well done, bravo on the acting!</p><p></p><p>When it came to the acting skills of the three, he, Yin Jiukai, had to admit he was no match for them.</p><p></p><p>Seeing Yin Jiukai in a dazed and listless state, the trio of Left Choushan, Su Qianghe, and Zhao Wuyou felt guilty, not knowing what to do.</p><p></p><p>Su Qianghe's eyes lit up as he quickly said, "Fourth Elder, the Grand Elder couldn't possibly be away for so long. He's probably just drinking the wine. Let's go catch him red-handed!"</p><p></p><p>"At that time, the worst that could happen is that we'll let you have a bit more, just to compensate you!!"</p><p></p><p>Left Choushan and Zhao Wuyou hastily nodded in agreement.</p><p></p><p>Yin Jiukai's throat moved, and he reluctantly said, "But that's the Grand Elder. What can you guys do? Besides, the Grand Elder will just flat-out deny it..."</p><p></p><p>"We normally respect the Grand Elder, but if he's hogging the wine the Sect Master bestowed upon us, then that's unacceptable. At worst, we'll threaten to confront him before the Sect Master, and the Grand Elder will definitely be scared into confessing the truth!"</p><p></p><p>Su Qianghe said with full confidence.</p><p></p><p>The trio: "......"</p><p></p><p>This plan is brilliant!</p><p></p><p>The three couldn't help but look at Su Qianghe with admiring eyes. </p><p></p><p>This guy may seem simple-minded on the surface, but when it comes to anything related to alcohol, his brain works lightning fast!</p><p></p><p>"We mustn't delay, let's go!!" Yin Jiukai hurriedly stood up.</p><p></p><p>Left Choushan quickly looked towards the Executor Dharma Protectors and called out, "Xingqiu, you all keep an eye on the disciples. We Elders are going to take care of something!"</p><p></p><p>With that, they disappeared from the puzzled gazes of the Executor Dharma Protectors and the disciples.</p><p></p><p>Ah, these...</p><p></p><p>The Elders really have a deep bond, even going to the restroom together as a group.</p><p></p><p>.........</p><p></p><p>In the secluded frozen plains, Lu Changsheng sat alone by the campfire, turning a stick in his hands, seemingly roasting something.</p><p></p><p>He quietly watched the gradually golden-hued beast meat in the fire, inhaling the lingering aroma.</p><p></p><p>Beside him lay an entire leg of an Ice Flame Tiger, bigger than twenty Lu Changshengs combined. The meat he was roasting now was just a small portion carved from it.</p><p></p><p>After a moment, Lu Changsheng took out the roasted Ice Flame Tiger meat and, without caring about the heat, took a big bite. After chewing for a while, he smiled and said, "The taste is good. This kind of beast meat would be less delicious if seasoned with salt and spices."</p><p></p><p>He then picked up a gourd and took a sip.</p><p></p><p>The key was just to enjoy it simply.</p><p></p><p>Just then, footsteps approached, and four figures came to the spot.</p><p></p><p>Lu Changsheng showed no surprise and did not look towards them, continuing to eat the meat and drink the wine.</p><p></p><p>Leifeng looked at the young man by the campfire, his throat involuntarily moving.</p><p></p><p>This person was the same blue-robed young man he had seen earlier...</p><p></p><p>Damn, he's really good at enjoying himself...</p><p></p><p>What kind of wine was he drinking? How could it be so fragrant and mellow?</p><p></p><p>Leiying and the two Dharma Protectors also had an unnatural expression, unconsciously licking their lips.</p><p></p><p>The Ice Flame Tiger meat was not unusual, but the aroma of the wine was...quite enticing.</p><p></p><p>Yes, they were drawn here by the allure of that wine.</p><p></p><p>"Ahem, fellow Daoist, I am Leifeng of the Great Sun Thunder Sect. We were attracted by the aroma of the wine and wonder if you have any more to sell? We'll pay a high price!"</p><p></p><p>Leifeng introduced himself sincerely and then expressed his intention.</p><p></p><p>Sell wine?</p><p></p><p>Lu Changsheng's brow raised slightly. His current identity was the Carefree Sect Master, not a tavern keeper anymore...</p><p></p><p>He then smiled and said, "Apologies, gentlemen, but I haven't sold wine in many years."</p><p></p><p>Leifeng and the others: "......"</p>

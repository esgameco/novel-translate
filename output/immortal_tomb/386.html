        <h1>Chapter 386</h1>
        <div class="content">
            <p>Here is the full English translation of the excerpt from the Chinese novel:</p><p></p><p>After seeing the familiar face, Hunhui was startled for a moment, involuntarily taking a step back. Soon, the indifference on his face turned into a bitter smile as he cupped his hands and said:</p><p></p><p>"Immortal Emperor of Longevity, I didn't expect it to be you..."</p><p></p><p>That's fine, it's normal.</p><p></p><p>Given his relationship with Lu Changsheng, the deaths of those people were trivial matters.</p><p></p><p>What puzzled him was that Lu Changsheng's strength had actually soared to such a degree.</p><p></p><p>Previously, he was willing to befriend Lu Changsheng out of a certain respect, and the main reason was the boundless potential of the Eternal Longevity Body, apart from some special circumstances.</p><p></p><p>It could even be said that any person in the world would one day enter his Soul Realm and reincarnate, but Lu Changsheng was an exception.</p><p></p><p>Lu Changsheng chuckled softly and said, "Soul Emperor, have you come to fight me?"</p><p></p><p>Hunhui sighed and cupped his hands, saying, "Immortal Emperor of Longevity, please don't joke about it."</p><p></p><p>"Can you say that you didn't come for that?" Lu Changsheng asked.</p><p></p><p>Hunhui coughed dryly and laughed awkwardly.</p><p></p><p>Jian Wuhui and the others were stunned by the drastic change in the attitude of the man in the black robe. </p><p></p><p>They could also tell that the man in the black robe seemed to know Lu Changsheng.</p><p></p><p>From their friendly conversation, it was evident that they were acquainted.</p><p></p><p>But the Soul Emperor... they had never heard of it before. What a powerful figure was it?</p><p></p><p>Since one circle is higher than another, for him to be so familiar with Lu Changsheng, he must be an extremely powerful one.</p><p></p><p>"Since you've come, let's have a drink," Lu Changsheng said, waving his hand and taking a seat.</p><p></p><p>Seeing this, Hunhui could only rub his hands and sit down, no longer having the aura of a Soul Emperor.</p><p></p><p>For some reason, he, the sovereign of the Soul Realm, always felt very constrained when facing Lu Changsheng, as if he was being suppressed by a nemesis. How strange!</p><p></p><p>Jian Wuhui and the others also slowly sat down, and Jiang Wuxin began to pour wine for everyone, starting with Lu Changsheng.</p><p></p><p>"What's wrong? Did too many people die at the Divine-Demonic Battlefield at once, and your Soul Realm couldn't handle it?" Lu Changsheng asked, taking a sip of wine and smiling.</p><p></p><p>This casual remark, however, sounded terrifying to Jian Wuhui and the others!</p><p></p><p>Jiang Wuxin's hand even trembled slightly as she poured the wine.</p><p></p><p>The hearts of the group began to race, and they couldn't help but glance at the imposing figure of the man in the black robe.</p><p></p><p>Hunhui shook his head and chuckled, rubbing his temples, "Immortal Emperor of Longevity, you don't know. At that time, my Soul Realm was in an uproar. Normally, it's very stable, but to have so many souls come in at once is a rare occurrence."</p><p></p><p>Jian Wuhui and the others were horrified. They even forgot to drink the wine!</p><p></p><p>This man in the black robe...</p><p></p><p>Could it be that the place their souls would go after death is under his management???</p><p></p><p>Whew!</p><p></p><p>Even though they were high-ranking figures, they couldn't help but take a sharp breath.</p><p></p><p>Their sidelong glances kept shifting between the man in the black robe, who was chatting casually with Lu Changsheng like old friends, and Lu Changsheng himself...</p><p></p><p>In that moment, they were filled with a sense of dread.</p><p></p><p>Lu Changsheng laughed and said, "Don't worry, when the myriad races come to pressure us again, who knows how many more will die."</p><p></p><p>Hunhui: "..."</p><p></p><p>Suddenly, Hunhui's brow furrowed as he looked towards a corner of the hall and shouted, "You sneaky fellow, come out!"</p><p></p><p>Jian Wuhui and the others paused.</p><p></p><p>As for Lu Changsheng, he was unsurprised and continued to drink his wine.</p><p></p><p>Jian Wuhui seemed to have realized something, his expression changing slightly as he called out, "Hong Yun?"</p><p></p><p>Soon, a woman in red clothes slowly emerged from the darkness.</p><p></p><p>Hong Yun's expression was slightly stiff. She thought her hiding was good enough...</p><p></p><p>"Hong Yun, quickly come and greet the two of them," Jian Wuhui said.</p><p></p><p>Here is my translation of the Chinese excerpt:</p><p></p><p>"Greetings, esteemed lords!" </p><p></p><p>Jian Wuhui immediately called out in a low voice.</p><p></p><p>This was not only for the sake of Hong Yun, but also for himself!</p><p></p><p>After all, they had signed a life-and-death pact, so if anything happened to Hong Yun, Jian Wuhui would be in trouble as well...</p><p></p><p>He had not yet mastered the ultimate sword techniques, and could not afford to die in vain.</p><p></p><p>Hong Yun bowed to Lu Changsheng and Hun Kui, saying softly, "Greetings, esteemed lords..."</p><p></p><p>She had actually coveted Lu Changsheng's Eternal Immortal Body before, but after so many powerful alien experts died three months ago, she no longer dared to.</p><p></p><p>Hong Yun was also relieved, otherwise she really wouldn't have known how she died...</p><p></p><p>At the moment, both the man in blue and the man in black were putting tremendous pressure on her!</p><p></p><p>Especially the man in black, he was like her nemesis, his aura making her extremely uncomfortable.</p><p></p><p>Hun Kui stared at her indifferently, "You insignificant little demon, daring to hide in the presence of this Emperor and the Immortal Emperor of Longevity!"</p><p></p><p>As Hun Kui spoke, the hall shook, and his might as the Soul Emperor was mercilessly displayed before others.</p><p></p><p>Hong Yun's delicate frame in the red robe trembled, and she knelt on the ground in fright!</p><p></p><p>"Leave."</p><p></p><p>Hearing Hun Kui's words, Hong Yun felt relieved, and quickly disappeared as a red glow.</p><p></p><p>After a moment of silence in the hall, Lu Changsheng's eyes suddenly flashed, "Hun Kui, you've come at the right time, follow me to the Carefree Sect."</p><p></p><p>The Carefree Sect?</p><p></p><p>Although Hun Kui didn't know where that was, he naturally wouldn't refuse.</p><p></p><p>"You all carry on."</p><p></p><p>Lu Changsheng casually called out to Jian Wuhui's group, then left with Hun Kui.</p><p></p><p>"Ah, Miss Hong Yun really is, she must have disturbed the gentlemen's pleasure." Mang Tian lamented.</p><p></p><p>Han Jinlong looked up with reverence, "The Lord of the Soul Realm... Lord Lu actually knows such a figure we've never even heard of."</p><p></p><p>Jian Wuhui's group also looked at him with awe, Lu Changsheng was truly too mysterious...</p><p></p><p>After this, they suddenly weren't as tense about the upcoming pressure from the myriad tribes. </p><p></p><p>If Lord Lu could handle it, that was their intuition!</p><p></p><p>...</p><p></p><p>In a remote area of the human territory.</p><p></p><p>The figures of Lu Changsheng and Hun Kui appeared.</p><p></p><p>Hun Kui looked around the desolate area suspiciously, muttering, "Immortal Emperor of Longevity... where is the Carefree Sect?"</p><p></p><p>Lu Changsheng shook his head and smiled, "How could I really take you to the Carefree Sect, to see the old turtle?"</p><p></p><p>As he said this, he opened his palm, and the miniature Grand Dao Demon-Subduing Tower appeared in his palm.</p><p></p><p>"What is this?" Hun Kui stared intently at the Grand Dao Demon-Subduing Tower!</p><p></p><p>He could feel that this tower, emanating multicolored light, was very abnormal!</p><p></p><p>Because the moment the tower appeared, he had a feeling of being drawn into it!</p><p></p><p>That was somewhat terrifying!</p><p></p><p>"This is called the Grand Dao Demon-Subduing Tower. I summoned you out here to take you inside and show you a certain 'thing', to see if you recognize it," Lu Changsheng said softly.</p><p></p><p>A 'thing'?</p><p></p><p>Hun Kui was puzzled.</p><p></p><p>"Alright."</p><p></p><p>As soon as Hun Kui agreed, Lu Changsheng led him to become a beam of light and disappear into the Grand Dao Demon-Subduing Tower.</p><p></p><p>In the remote wilderness, only the miniature Grand Dao Demon-Subduing Tower remained, slowly rotating and emitting an eerie, dreamlike multicolored light.</p>

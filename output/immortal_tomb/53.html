        <div class="content">
            <p>Here is my translation of the Chinese excerpt:</p><p></p><p>The Sect Master was soul-searched?!</p><p></p><p>The elders' pupils shrank, and they exchanged glances. </p><p></p><p>When did this happen?</p><p></p><p>"Still not saying? Don't worry, just speak up, and I will help you take care of it!"</p><p></p><p>Shen Jing Tao's gaze was sharp, and his brow was gloomy.</p><p></p><p>The current Sect Master of his Qing Yun Sect was actually soul-searched, which was a great humiliation, as if they didn't even consider Shen Jing Tao at all.</p><p></p><p>How dare they!</p><p></p><p>Moreover, he was now at the Nascent Soul stage, so naturally, he had the confidence.</p><p></p><p>The elders felt Shen Jing Tao's anger and were as timid as cicadas in winter.</p><p></p><p>The Patriarch was angry.</p><p></p><p>Faced with such questioning, Shen Miao Jun could only bitterly say, </p><p></p><p>"Zi Ji Thunder Peak, Jiang Yuan."</p><p></p><p>The elders were stunned, and their ears seemed to be filled with thunderous sounds.</p><p></p><p>In the Eastern Domain, or even the entire Immortal Cultivation World, who doesn't know the name of the Patriarch of Zi Ji Thunder Peak, Jiang Yuan?</p><p></p><p>"Cough, what is the story here, Miao Jun?" </p><p></p><p>Shen Jing Tao quickly suppressed the anger on his face, coughed dryly, and asked somewhat embarrassedly.</p><p></p><p>If the one who soul-searched was that Jiang Yuan, then it's temporarily settled...</p><p></p><p>The strength is not enough, even if he gets beaten, he must stand straight.</p><p></p><p>Shen Miao Jun was not surprised by the change in Shen Jing Tao's expression, then said softly,</p><p></p><p>"Three years ago..."</p><p></p><p>After Shen Miao Jun finished recounting the cause and effect,</p><p></p><p>the faces of the elders were already filled with anger.</p><p></p><p>To soul-search without reason, this is simply unreasonable. Don't they know how much damage soul-searching can do to a cultivator?</p><p></p><p>A Tribulation Transcendence expert, can they just do as they please?</p><p></p><p>And that Jiang Yuan, after soul-searching, also knew the truth, but in these three years, there was not the slightest indication, how hateful...</p><p></p><p>"So, I won't go to observe the Ascension Tribulation this time, Miao Jun said in a hoarse voice. Even if I go, it would be useless, and if I encounter that Jiang Yuan, I..."</p><p></p><p>Shen Miao Jun looked at Shen Jing Tao.</p><p></p><p>What troubled her the most was that since she was soul-searched three years ago, her cultivation path seemed to be visible to the naked eye.</p><p></p><p>Shen Jing Tao was silent for a long time, then sighed towards the sky,</p><p></p><p>"Miao Jun, it is this Patriarch's uselessness."</p><p></p><p>If he were also at the Tribulation Transcendence stage, then Jiang Yuan would certainly not dare to be so reckless!</p><p></p><p>Unfortunately, there are no "ifs".</p><p></p><p>"Patriarch, don't blame yourself, after all, Jiang Yuan is the overlord of the Immortal Cultivation World in the Eastern Domain, and our Qing Yun Sect is just a small sect, naturally we can't provoke him," Shen Miao Jun comforted.</p><p></p><p>Shen Jing Tao waved his hand, somewhat powerlessly: "Miao Jun, don't worry, this Patriarch will try his best to help you find some heavenly treasures to repair your spiritual sense. Here is a spiritual herb that can help with spiritual sense recovery, you take it first."</p><p></p><p>After saying that, he flipped his hand and handed a blue flower emitting a misty aura to Shen Miao Jun, sighed, and then disappeared.</p><p></p><p>"Ganda Flower."</p><p></p><p>The elders were shocked as they looked at the blue flower in Shen Miao Jun's hand, inwardly exclaiming in amazement.</p><p></p><p>The Patriarch really has such a precious treasure.</p><p></p><p>Shen Miao Jun looked at the flower in her hand and also sighed.</p><p></p><p>The Ganda Flower is quite effective in repairing spiritual sense, but it's a pity that there's only one.</p><p></p><p>For her severely damaged spiritual sense, the effect would be somewhat limited.</p><p></p><p>She then looked at the Grand Elder and said,</p><p></p><p>"Grand Elder, you are now at the Initial Nascent Soul stage, you should go with the Patriarch to observe the Ascension Tribulation."</p><p></p><p>The Grand Elder was slightly taken aback, opened his mouth, and finally bowed and said, "Yes."</p><p></p><p>"As for the other elders, go guard the Mundane Realm, do not let your guard down."</p><p></p><p>"Yes."</p><p></p><p>Soon, the elders in the hall left, only the Ancient Crane Forest was still hesitating to speak.</p><p></p><p>"Hmm? Ancient Elder, do you have anything else?" Shen Miao Jun asked curiously.</p><p></p><p>Ancient Crane Forest took a light breath and said in a solemn voice, "Sect Master, I have just passed through the Heart Demon Tribulation, and the Nascent Soul Thunder Tribulation may come soon..."</p><p></p><p>Here is the full English translation of the Chinese excerpt:</p><p></p><p>Shen Miaoyun was slightly taken aback and exclaimed, "Did the Elder only go through the Demonic Tribulation once?"</p><p></p><p>She had been in a complete mess because of this Demonic Tribulation, taking her three times to overcome it!</p><p></p><p>"Just lucky," Ancient Crane Lin smiled humbly.</p><p></p><p>Shen Miaoyun nodded approvingly, then frowned and said, "But the Patriarch and the Grand Elder need to go to the Western Realm to observe the Ascension Tribulation. At that time, three people are needed to provide you with protection, and our sect is one of them, so there are two more..."</p><p></p><p>The Nascent Soul Thunder Tribulation, the Elders at the Golden Core stage absolutely cannot provide protection, or they might perish in the thunder tribulation.</p><p></p><p>"Hehe, Sect Master, this time you don't need to trouble the sect. Crane Lin has already discussed it with the Gentleman, and he said he is willing to protect me, I just wanted to inform you," Ancient Crane Lin said with a smile.</p><p></p><p>Shen Miaoyun paused, she naturally knew that the "Gentleman" Ancient Crane Lin mentioned was that young man in blue. Having a Transcendent stage cultivator for protection was indeed more secure than a Nascent Soul stage cultivator, so she smiled and said, "Okay, then our sect congratulates you in advance on your advancement to the Nascent Soul stage."</p><p></p><p>Once Ancient Crane Lin advanced to the Nascent Soul stage, the overall strength of the Azure Cloud Sect would naturally rise.</p><p></p><p>Ancient Crane Lin shook his head bitterly, he was not even sure if he could successfully advance.</p><p></p><p>He was afraid that he might be seriously injured or even killed during the thunder tribulation.</p><p></p><p>...</p><p></p><p>In the Demon Realm.</p><p></p><p>A thousand-zhang giant snake emerged from a huge hole and transformed into a young man with a bare upper body.</p><p></p><p>"My tail has finally recovered," Fierce Soaring Snake murmured.</p><p></p><p>"Demon King Fierce Soaring Snake, you've finally come out of seclusion," the Demon King of Vajra came to meet him.</p><p></p><p>As soon as he sensed Fierce Soaring Snake's aura, he hurried over.</p><p></p><p>"Demon King of Vajra, how long has it been since I went into seclusion?" Fierce Soaring Snake asked curiously.</p><p></p><p>"Three years," the Demon King of Vajra continued, "Demon King Fierce Soaring Snake, shall we take the other three Demon Kings and go to the Demon Realm to settle the score? I really can't swallow this over the past three years!"</p><p></p><p>Fierce Soaring Snake's expression was unsettled, and he finally asked, "During these three years, have they made a move against Lishui?"</p><p></p><p>"No, our Demon Lords and their Demon Sovereigns have been missing, and they haven't given any orders," the Demon King of Vajra said.</p><p></p><p>"Oh, by the way, Zhang Youdao from the Xiluo Monastery in the Western Realm of the Immortal Cultivation World is about to undergo the Ascension Tribulation."</p><p></p><p>The Demon King of Vajra suddenly said.</p><p></p><p>"Oh?" Fierce Soaring Snake's eyes lit up, and he sneered, "That's perfect timing. I'm sure all the Nascent Soul and above cultivators of the Azure Cloud Sect have gone to observe."</p><p></p><p>The Demon King of Vajra smiled and said, "That's right, you're thinking of..."</p><p></p><p>"Yes, take the opportunity to send the Great Earth Dragon Bear to directly occupy Lishui."</p><p></p><p>Fierce Soaring Snake snorted with laughter, "As for the account with Zhao Shenyuan, we'll settle it later."</p><p></p><p>The Demon King of Vajra's pupils shrank.</p><p></p><p>The Great Earth Dragon Bear? </p><p></p><p>That was the third most powerful cultivator in the Demon Realm, aside from the five Demon Kings...</p><p></p><p>Wouldn't that be a bit of overkill? Didn't they say that all the Nascent Soul and above cultivators of the Azure Cloud Sect had left?</p><p></p><p>Meanwhile, in the Demon Realm.</p><p></p><p>"Zhang Youdao of the Xiluo Monastery is undergoing the Ascension Tribulation? Wonderful," Zhao Shenyuan coldly smiled, a trace of eagerness appearing in his eyes. </p><p></p><p>Through the faint connection of his soul, he knew that the Abyss Demon Spear was still in the Lishui area. This time, he must retrieve it.</p><p></p><p>And thoroughly occupy Lishui as well.</p><p></p><p>He no longer had any expectations of those useless ones in the Demon Realm.</p><p></p><p>The Demon Sovereign has been silent for some reason until now... This time, he didn't want to wait any longer.</p><p></p><p>He wanted to take action himself!</p><p></p><p>Thinking of the Immortal Tomb, thinking of the Demon Sovereign and Demon King's earth-shattering plan, excitement and bloodlust flashed in Zhao Shenyuan's eyes!!</p><p></p><p>This time, let him, Zhao Shenyuan, open the curtain of war!</p><p></p><p>He was confident that the Demon Sovereign and Demon King would not be able to hold back then!</p>

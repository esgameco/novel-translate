        <h1>Chapter 466</h1>
        <div class="content">
            <p>Here is the full English translation of the Chinese excerpt:</p><p></p><p>The moment the grand formation was activated, the entire Hezhu Clan was shaken.</p><p></p><p>The crimson energy patterns composed of countless blood-red light beams were flashing frantically in all directions.</p><p></p><p>This sight suddenly filled He Lian's heart with unease.</p><p></p><p>Even He Yanqi, who was currently refining the Myriad Worlds Calamity Body, had his tightly closed eyelids twitching, clearly also sensing the abnormality outside.</p><p></p><p>He Yanqi was also anxious in his heart, because the refinement of the Myriad Worlds Calamity Body had not shown any progress so far.</p><p></p><p>Normally, he would not be anxious, as refining the Myriad Worlds Calamity Body was certainly not that simple.</p><p></p><p>But the man in the black robe had clearly said that by relying on the Extreme Refinement Formation, refining the Myriad Worlds Calamity Body would not take more than three days at most. By that logic, there should have been some progress by now.</p><p></p><p>He Yanqi felt more and more that something was not right.</p><p></p><p>Even He Xitong, who was seated in the Extreme Refinement Formation, had opened her eyes, full of confusion, as if wondering if the refinement of her Myriad Worlds Calamity Body had not even begun yet.</p><p></p><p>"Star Master, what is going on?" He Lian snapped out of her thoughts and asked the man in the black robe anxiously.</p><p></p><p>"Hehe, what's going on? How could I not understand the words of the Hezhu Clan Chief?" the man in the black robe said mockingly.</p><p></p><p>He Lian trembled as she pointed at the blood-red formation: "This is definitely not the so-called Screening Heaven Formation!!"</p><p></p><p>"Hahaha!!" The man in the black robe suddenly threw his head back and laughed loudly. "The Hezhu Clan Chief is not stupid either. This is indeed not the Screening Heaven Formation."</p><p></p><p>He Lian's eyes gradually turned bloodshot, and she said in a trembling voice, "The Clan Chief has long known that blessings don't just fall from the sky. You... what kind of plot are you hatching..."</p><p></p><p>The man in the black robe looked up at the blood-red formation and said indifferently, "Even if you knew this was a plot, would you dare to resist me?"</p><p></p><p>He Lian fell silent.</p><p></p><p>"The Myriad Worlds Calamity Body is the purpose of my trip. Such a constitution is wasted on you mortals, as you cannot fully explore its mysteries. It's better for me to take charge of it."</p><p></p><p>The man in the black robe turned his head to look at He Xitong, his eyes gleaming with greed, as if his grand plan had succeeded:</p><p></p><p>"Hezhu Clan Chief, I'll tell you directly. The Extreme Refinement Formation is real, but it's for my own preparation. As for the so-called Screening Heaven Formation, it's actually the Refining Heaven Formation! With the Dao of Heaven and Earth, refining the entire Qiankun Heaven is indeed not easy, and I don't have that much time. But refining your Hollow Ancient Realm is more than enough!"</p><p></p><p>"I will refine the Myriad Worlds Calamity Body along with all the powerful experts concentrated in the Hezhu Clan, and then refine them, to achieve my supreme Myriad Worlds Body!"</p><p></p><p>What?!</p><p></p><p>He Lian was horrified and lost her color.</p><p></p><p>Even He Yanqi in the Extreme Refinement Formation had his expression change drastically, no longer able to calm his mind.</p><p></p><p>Even He Xitong's face turned pale. She was not worried about herself, as no matter what, she was doomed to die. What she was worried about was her mother, who was still in the Devouring Abyss.</p><p></p><p>"You... you... will not end well!" He Lian's pupils trembled, her mind completely shattered.</p><p></p><p>The man in the black robe suddenly turned his head and looked at her sharply!</p><p></p><p>Boom!</p><p></p><p>With just one glance, He Lian's chest caved in, as if she had been struck by a giant hammer.</p><p></p><p>He Lian's face turned deathly pale, and she coughed up fresh blood, collapsing to the ground.</p><p></p><p>The man in the black robe said indifferently, "I don't have time to deal with you now. You'd better behave, or I'll kill you first."</p><p></p><p>He Lian was at least at the Spirit Void Realm, and the man in the black robe didn't want to waste her, planning to refine her along with the others later.</p><p></p><p>At this time, the already enraged He Yanqi put away his hand gestures, wanting to come out of the Extreme Refinement Formation, but was horrified to find that his body seemed to be restricted and he could not move at all.</p><p></p><p>He turned his head and saw the man in the black robe seemingly coldly watching him:</p><p></p><p>"What does it matter that you've grasped a bit of the essence of the Laws as a Spirit Void Realm cultivator? Once you're in the Extreme Refinement Formation, you won't be able to get out. Stay put."</p><p></p><p>The man in the black robe finished speaking and no longer paid attention to the increasingly unsightly-looking He Yanqi, but instead looked towards the Hezhu Clan, seemingly starting to search for that young man in green.</p><p></p><p>Here is the full English translation of the Chinese excerpt:</p><p></p><p>It was not just the stern words of Heshen in the Refining Array. As time passed and the Grand Celestial Array continued to operate, everyone within the array began to move more and more sluggishly and stiffly.</p><p></p><p>"What, what's going on? I'm having trouble moving my legs..."</p><p></p><p>"Huff, huff, huff... No joke, I feel like there are ten thousand mountains pressing down on my shoulders!"</p><p></p><p>"No, no, something is not right with the He Clan! It's definitely this blood-red array, there's something strange about it!!"</p><p></p><p>"I see, I see, so the Elders of the Ouyang Clan intentionally lured us into the He Clan!!"</p><p></p><p>"Ah... I, I can't move."</p><p></p><p>...</p><p></p><p>At the same time, Ouyang Mo and the others also had looks of surprise and doubt on their faces, because their situation was similar to Hong Wanjun and the others - their bodies were gradually being suppressed, making it difficult for them to move.</p><p></p><p>"Elder Ouyang, what's going on, the array seems to be suppressing us as well..."</p><p></p><p>"Why, we're not the enemy!!"</p><p></p><p>"..."</p><p></p><p>Hearing the anxious and indignant words of the clan leaders of the ancient superior clans, Ouyang Mo's heart grew increasingly heavy.</p><p></p><p>Ouyang couldn't help but look at the blood-red array, his heart starting to feel uneasy.</p><p></p><p>What exactly was the Star Master planning to do?</p><p></p><p>The Star Master had only given the order to lure in enough people, and then hand them over to the He Clan to deal with.</p><p></p><p>But the current situation was very abnormal. They were now struggling to move, being suppressed, and it was definitely related to this blood-red array, not the Screening Heaven Array...</p><p></p><p>Ouyang Mo realized that they had been used as cannon fodder, and not only that, now their own lives might be at stake.</p><p></p><p>On the other side, the Ye Clan group.</p><p></p><p>"Ancestor, clan leader, what should we do... It seems the He Clan wants to wipe us all out."</p><p></p><p>"This despicable He Clan, how can they have such a huge array!"</p><p></p><p>"..."</p><p></p><p>The expressions of the Ye Clan disciples were grim, and despair gradually appeared in their eyes. Ye Zhuiyue and Ye Zhuixing exchanged a glance, their eyes full of bitterness. What could they do when even Hong Wanjun and the others were in such a predicament?</p><p></p><p>They suddenly thought of Lu Changsheng, and quickly turned their heads to look at him, only to be stunned to see Lu Changsheng still leisurely eating some fruit.</p><p></p><p>Sensing their gaze, Lu Changsheng paused for a moment, then continued to toss a fruit into his mouth, chewing as he said, "What are you all looking at me for? Can't you see I can't move either?"</p><p></p><p>Ye Zhuiyue and the others looked at Lu Changsheng with admiration in their eyes, inwardly sighing that Elder Lu was indeed a great-hearted person...</p><p></p><p>"Ouyang Mo!! You knew the He Clan had prepared a grand array, so you deliberately pretended to be weak to lure us in, didn't you? You are despicable and shameless!"</p><p></p><p>Suddenly, Hong Wanjun in the back shouted with an extremely ugly expression.</p><p></p><p>Ouyang Mo slowly closed his eyes and coldly said, "Hong Wanjun, open your eyes and take a good look. It's not just you who are being suppressed. Haven't you noticed that we on this side are also having difficulty moving?"</p><p></p><p>Hong Wanjun and the others paused, and indeed noticed that Ouyang Mo and the others also seemed to be suppressed, causing their hearts to be filled with doubt!</p><p></p><p>What exactly was the He Clan trying to do, even suppressing their own allies?</p><p></p><p>And most importantly, what kind of grand array was this, that could suppress all of them? </p><p></p><p>After all, even the mighty Hong Wanjun at the Divine Void Realm was being suppressed!</p><p></p><p>How capable had the He Clan become?</p><p></p><p>Ouyang Mo suddenly said, "Hong Wanjun, don't be foolish. Do you think the He Clan could produce an array capable of suppressing you and me? There must be someone else within the He Clan!"</p>

        <h1>Chapter 30</h1>
        <div class="content">
            <p>Here is the full English translation of the Chinese excerpt:</p><p></p><p>Looking at the silent young man. üíé‚úåÔºñÔºôÔº≥–Ω«óÔΩò.ƒåùìûÁà™üêçüê†</p><p></p><p>Lu Changsheng suddenly said, "The other night when the demons attacked, did you see the immortal that appeared?"</p><p></p><p>This father and son had been immersed in their emotions, but this abrupt question instantly pulled them out of it.</p><p></p><p>The young man's brow furrowed slightly, and he said in a bright tone: "Sir, of course I saw him. The immortal was so majestic! Although my vision wasn't great at the time, everyone could vaguely see that the immortal just waved his sleeve, and those demons were all wiped out!"</p><p></p><p>The young man's tone was very excited.</p><p></p><p>However, Lu Changsheng shook his head and said, "I'm not talking about the immortal that appeared later, but the one before that."</p><p></p><p>He was naturally referring to the ancient Crane Forest.</p><p></p><p>The immortal before? </p><p></p><p>The young man paused for a moment, then became equally excited and said,</p><p></p><p>"The previous immortal was also very powerful. Under the moonlight, he flew on a sword, unleashing a thousand blades at once! He was exactly like the immortal I've always imagined in my heart! Especially that line about seeking longevity, but more seeking the heroic spirit within! He was simply too cool!"</p><p></p><p>"Although that immortal almost lost, he was still very formidable."</p><p></p><p>Seeing the young man's admiring expression, Lu Changsheng smiled and asked, "Then do you want to cultivate immortality?"</p><p></p><p>"I do, of course I do! If I could become an immortal, I might be able to cure my father's paralysis!" </p><p></p><p>The young man raised his head abruptly, but soon became dejected and lowered it again: "But it's impossible."</p><p></p><p>"Your father treats you this way, yet you still think of him first?" Lu Changsheng said indifferently.</p><p></p><p>The middle-aged man lowered his head, a flash of shame in his eyes.</p><p></p><p>"I know that immortal, and if you want to cultivate immortality, I can introduce you to him." Lu Changsheng looked at the young man.</p><p></p><p>The young man was stunned, looking at the man in the blue robe in disbelief.</p><p></p><p>It was like a dream.</p><p></p><p>After this interaction, he didn't think the man in blue was joking with him.</p><p></p><p>But rather, it was true...</p><p></p><p>The middle-aged man's expression changed slightly, quickly looking at the young man, his eyes filled with hope, and said, "Dongzi, your father hopes you will go cultivate immortality!"</p><p></p><p>The young man was bewildered, "Father, what will happen to you if I leave?"</p><p></p><p>Lu Changsheng squatted down, rubbing his knuckles, and quietly watched them.</p><p></p><p>The middle-aged man's face was bleak, and a bitter smile appeared on his face: "Dongzi has taken care of his father for so long, that's enough... In the future, let the father fend for himself."</p><p></p><p>"No, no way!" The young man suddenly stood up, his eyes reddening, and pleaded to Lu Changsheng, "Sir, I really want to cultivate immortality, but if I leave, my father will die. Can you please take him with me so I can take care of him?"</p><p></p><p>A flash of joy appeared in the middle-aged man's eyes, but it quickly disappeared.</p><p></p><p>"I've already said, why do you still have to consider him?" Lu Changsheng smiled.</p><p></p><p>The young man lowered his head and said softly, "No matter whether my father is as the sir said, he is still my father, an undeniable fact. As a son, I should filial."</p><p></p><p>Lu Changsheng pursed his lips and looked at the 11-year-old young man in front of him, nodding slightly: "Good."</p><p></p><p>Then he looked at the middle-aged man and said, "I have a elixir here, given to me by an immortal. It can revive the dead and heal your paralysis with ease, even a mortal can take it. Do you want it?"</p><p></p><p>The middle-aged man was stunned for a moment, but in an instant, his eyes flashed with a fanatical light, nodding frantically.</p><p></p><p>He was tired of this inhuman life!</p><p></p><p>"I can give you the elixir, but after that, you and your son will have no more relationship, and you will never see each other again in this life."</p><p></p><p>Lu Changsheng said softly.</p><p></p><p>This would be an excellent blessing for the two of them.</p><p>One could cultivate immortality, the other could be healed.</p><p>If it weren't for Lu Changsheng, the young man and the middle-aged man's fate would probably be tragic.</p><p></p><p>"Good! I'll do as the sir says!" The middle-aged man did not hesitate, nodding decisively!</p><p></p><p>"Father..." </p><p></p><p>The young man looked blankly at the middle-aged man.</p><p></p><p>"Dongzi, in the future when you step onto the immortal path, your father and you will be different as immortal and mortal. It's better for you to sever this earthly connection, and it's for your own good."</p><p></p><p>The middle-aged man's gaze was evasive.</p><p></p><p>Lu Changsheng nodded, and silently flipped his hand, a elixir pill appearing in his palm.</p><p></p><p>He handed it to the middle-aged man and said, "Alright, after you take this elixir pill, you will no longer have any relationship with your son."</p><p></p><p>"Okay!"</p><p></p><p>Here is the full English translation of the Chinese excerpt:</p><p></p><p>The middle-aged man was pleasantly surprised. Luchang Sheng loosened his grip, and the man quickly grabbed it with his mouth, swallowing it down greedily.</p><p></p><p>"My hand, I can feel it!" </p><p></p><p>Soon, the middle-aged man's excited exclamation rang out as he felt the trembling of his fingertips, overjoyed.</p><p></p><p>The young man shook his head and said with a brilliant smile, "Father, congratulations."</p><p></p><p>The middle-aged man paused, the smile fading from his face as he lowered his head without speaking.</p><p></p><p>At this moment, Luchang Sheng stood up, clapping his hands behind his back, and said, "Let's go, your father is now whole and will live well."</p><p></p><p>With that, he left without a glance at the middle-aged man.</p><p></p><p>The young man opened his mouth, his pupils trembling as he looked at the middle-aged man. Memories flashed through his mind, and tears welled up in his eyes, but he remained silent.</p><p></p><p>Finally, the young man clenched his teeth, straightened up, and quickly ran after Luchang Sheng, not looking back at the middle-aged man.</p><p></p><p>At this moment, the middle-aged man lifted his head blankly, watching the young man's retreating figure. The joy he had felt earlier had suddenly vanished.</p><p></p><p>For some reason, he felt a sense of emptiness in his heart.</p><p></p><p>"From now on, there will be no one in this world who will cherish you more, nor will there be anyone who will not abandon you even when you are in dire straits or disabled."</p><p></p><p>"You have lost it."</p><p></p><p>Hearing the voice of the man in green in his mind, the middle-aged man's eyes widened with fear, quickly looking around, but the man and the young man were nowhere to be seen.</p><p></p><p>"Haha, it's good that he's left, it's good! From now on, you won't have to suffer anymore. I... I'm not worthy to be your father! Ugh... Wah!"</p><p></p><p>The middle-aged man laughed maniacally and sobbed, frightening the passersby around him. His emotions were a complex mix of joy and sorrow.</p><p></p><p>He was happy that his child had cultivated immortality and that he himself was whole again.</p><p></p><p>But he was saddened by the fact that he would never see his child again.</p><p></p><p>However, he knew in his heart that this was the best outcome. Otherwise, the child might have been dragged down by him.</p><p></p><p>And he would have lived a gloomy and miserable life.</p><p></p><p>"There's no need to be sad. You already know in your heart, don't you? He's right about one thing."</p><p></p><p>Luchang Sheng walked with his hands behind his back, looking up at the sky.</p><p></p><p>The young man wiped his tears and asked puzzledly, "Sir, what do you mean?"</p><p></p><p>"In the future, when you enter the immortal path, you and him will be of different realms. It's better to sever the attachment. The filial piety you've shown him is enough."</p><p></p><p>Luchang Sheng spoke softly.</p><p></p><p>The young man pondered these words, and just as he was about to ask something, he was shocked to find that they had arrived at the gates of the Magistrate's Mansion!</p><p></p><p>"Sir, this is..." Before he could finish his trembling words, he was stunned by the sight before him.</p><p></p><p>The four guards at the mansion gates were all kneeling in the utmost reverence.</p><p></p><p>The young man had never seen such a grand display.</p><p></p><p>Luchang Sheng glanced at the young man and asked, "What's the matter?"</p><p></p><p>"N-nothing..." the young man stammered.</p><p></p><p>After Luchang Sheng went in, the young man took a deep breath and hurried to follow.</p><p></p><p>The four guards relaxed their tense nerves and stood up, looking towards the mansion.</p><p></p><p>"Huh, the sir brought a little beggar back with him?"</p><p></p><p>"If you want to die, don't drag me into it. How dare you comment on the sir's business!"</p><p></p><p>"I was just curious, that's all~"</p><p></p><p>"Shut up! The Magistrate has already ordered that everyone in the mansion must respect the sir even more than their own parents. You'd better not be curious about the sir's affairs!"</p><p></p><p>"That's right, even the king and all the officials are staying at the Magistrate's Mansion now. I heard from the maids that they all kneel before the sir..."</p><p></p><p>"Shhh!"</p><p></p><p>"With what you've said, I think I know the sir's identity now!"</p>

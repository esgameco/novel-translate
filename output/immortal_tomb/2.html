        <h1>Chapter 2</h1>
        <div class="content">
            <p>Here is the full English translation of the excerpt from the Chinese novel:</p><p></p><p>The hour of the Ox had just passed, and Lu Changsheng arrived at a village outside the city. At this moment, many in the village had already extinguished their lights and retired for the night, but there were still a few households with lights still burning. This village was not too far from the mountain range.</p><p></p><p>Thinking this, Lu Changsheng entered the village, his figure flashing as he quickly arrived at a brightly lit house, gently knocking on the door.</p><p></p><p>Knock, knock, knock.</p><p></p><p>Only the sound of slow, heavy footsteps could be heard from within, and soon the door creaked open. An old woman with a vacant gaze appeared before Lu Changsheng's eyes.</p><p></p><p>Before the old woman could curiously speak, Lu Changsheng smiled softly and said, "Old lady, it's already the hour of the Ox, and someone is knocking on your door. Aren't you afraid it might be an evil person?"</p><p></p><p>The old woman's hazy eyes seemed to be looking at Lu Changsheng as she smiled and said, "The village is so close to the mountain range, it's very safe here..."</p><p></p><p>Lu Changsheng smiled and looked into her eyes.</p><p></p><p>"It's so late now, sir, are you looking to stay the night?" the old woman asked with a smile.</p><p></p><p>"If it's not too much trouble..." Lu Changsheng had not finished speaking when the old woman interrupted, "Of course it's not too much trouble."</p><p></p><p>She turned and walked with small steps to the bed, picking up some weaving and slowly continuing her work.</p><p></p><p>Lu Changsheng glanced at the sleeping young girl on the bed, then stepped inside, gently closing the door behind him. He came to a table and sat down, silently watching the old woman's movements.</p><p></p><p>The old woman seemed to sense Lu Changsheng's gaze and said with a smile, "Sir, there is another bed in the inner room. You can rest there, though it is a bit old and broken, I hope you don't mind."</p><p></p><p>"I'm in no hurry," Lu Changsheng smiled. "But you, shouldn't you be resting on the bed?"</p><p></p><p>The old woman's hands did not stop working as she smiled and said, "I need to weave more cloth to sell and earn money to support my granddaughter's studies. It's quieter at night, so I can weave faster."</p><p></p><p>"It is indeed quieter at night than during the day," Lu Changsheng said, glancing at the old woman's vacant eyes. He then softly said, "Old lady, I want to ask you about the immortal tomb in the mountain range."</p><p></p><p>The old woman's hands paused for a moment, and she softly said, "Ask whatever you'd like, sir. The legends about the immortal tomb in the mountain range are well-known, though I'm not sure if what I say will be anything new to you."</p><p></p><p>"No matter, old lady, just tell me what you know, and I will listen attentively," Lu Changsheng said softly.</p><p></p><p>"Changsheng..." the old woman murmured to herself, then began to speak as she continued weaving, "No one knows how long the immortal tomb in the mountain range has existed. All we know is that it is likely the tomb of an immortal..."</p><p></p><p>Lu Changsheng listened quietly as the old woman spoke.</p><p></p><p>"I've heard the villagers say that some have seen shimmering lights in the night sky disappearing in the direction of the immortal tomb..."</p><p></p><p>At this point, the old woman suddenly fell silent.</p><p></p><p>Lu Changsheng looked over and saw that the weaving needle had pricked her palm, causing a small amount of blood to emerge.</p><p></p><p>"Pardon me, sir, let me continue..." the old woman said softly, wiping her palm and preparing to continue her narration.</p><p></p><p>"That's enough, you should rest now," Lu Changsheng said gently, standing up and heading towards the inner room.</p><p></p><p>The old woman paused, then smiled and turned to tuck the blanket more snugly around the sleeping girl.</p><p></p><p>In the inner room, Lu Changsheng lay on the bed, his eyes open.</p><p></p><p>From the old woman's words, he had not obtained any useful information - likely due to the limited knowledge of a common person. The origins of the immortal tomb were unknown, but judging from the quality of the tombs, it had likely existed for at least ten thousand years.</p><p></p><p>As for the shimmering lights in the night sky disappearing into the mountain range, Lu Changsheng didn't even need to think about it to know that they were simply cultivators coming and going, unrelated to the immortal tomb itself.</p><p></p><p>Thinking this, Lu Changsheng slowly closed his eyes. As for these mysteries, he was in no particular hurry. After all, what he lacked the most was not time.</p><p></p><p>Here is the full English translation of the Chinese excerpt:</p><p></p><p>It is time.</p><p></p><p>.........</p><p></p><p>New 69 Book Bar 99.com</p><p></p><p>The sun rose high in the sky.</p><p></p><p>The young girl sitting by the bed reading a book suddenly noticed that her grandmother's body had moved, and quickly turned around to see her open her eyes, a smile immediately appearing on her face.</p><p></p><p>But at this moment, the old woman's eyelids were fluttering violently, and after a moment of dazzling light, she was stunned!</p><p></p><p>The appearance of the young girl, with her charming smile, was clearly visible in her eyes at this moment.......</p><p></p><p>"Grandma is awake, Little Tong will go get you some water to wash your face!"</p><p></p><p>The young girl didn't notice the old woman's expression, and after saying that, she was about to get off the bed and leave.</p><p></p><p>"Little Tong!" The old woman hurriedly called out to the young girl.</p><p></p><p>The young girl paused, turning around and looking at her grandmother puzzledly, but was shocked to find that her grandmother's eyes were staring straight at her, no longer lifeless, but full of vitality and brimming with tears.</p><p></p><p>"Grandma, you..." the young girl stammered, somewhat uncertain.</p><p></p><p>The old woman reached out and touched the young girl's cheek, trembling as she said, "Grandma can see you now, it turns out my granddaughter is this beautiful..."</p><p></p><p>"Grandma!" The young girl threw herself into the old woman's arms and wept bitterly.</p><p></p><p>A moment later.</p><p></p><p>"Little Tong, there's a gentleman staying in the inner room, go wake him up and have him wash up, and I'll go make breakfast."</p><p></p><p>The old woman said with a smile, glancing around the room, then hurriedly went to prepare.</p><p></p><p>Now that her eyes had suddenly regained their sight, she felt that her whole life was different.</p><p></p><p>The young girl's gaze was puzzled, there was a gentleman staying in the inner room?</p><p></p><p>..........</p><p></p><p>"Grandma, there's no gentleman in the inner room?"</p><p></p><p>The young girl soon ran out and shouted.</p><p></p><p>Hearing this, the old woman's movements in cooking paused, and she went into the inner room to take a look, only to see a dilapidated bed and neatly folded bedding.</p><p></p><p>For some reason, the old woman couldn't help but touch her own eyes, murmuring,</p><p></p><p>"Grandma must have remembered it wrong... Come, let's eat."</p><p></p><p>.........</p><p></p><p>Lu Changsheng left the village at the hour of the tiger.</p><p></p><p>It wasn't because of anything else, but simply because he suddenly felt like drinking, his mouth was parched.</p><p></p><p>In the long river of time, the only thing that could always accompany him was alcohol, even that noisy turtle from before was no longer around.</p><p></p><p>It was noon,</p><p></p><p>A small town appeared in Lu Changsheng's line of sight, this town was already some distance from the immortal tomb.......</p><p></p><p>"Moyu Town."</p><p></p><p>Lu Changsheng thought to himself and followed the flow of people towards the town gate,</p><p></p><p>It was just that his ethereal and immortal-like demeanor made him stand out like a crane among chickens, exceptionally conspicuous.</p><p></p><p>Many passersby had their gazes fixed on this young man in blue, thinking he must be some young master or scholar.</p><p></p><p>This kind of bearing was not something the common people could possess.</p><p></p><p>Entering the town naturally required paying the town entry fee, this was a way for many town lord's offices or city lord's offices to collect revenue, setting up such a threshold could also help alleviate the population in the town or city.</p><p></p><p>Lu Changsheng saw that many commoners were all paying five copper coins, and soon it was his turn.</p><p></p><p>Lu Changsheng made a gesture to reach into his sleeve, just about to produce some coins......when he heard,</p><p></p><p>"Sir, you don't need to pay the town entry fee, please go ahead."</p><p></p><p>He then saw the two town gate guards slightly bow and smile, gesturing for him to enter.</p><p></p><p>This young man's bearing, they could tell he was a person of some background, and without knowing his origins, they were willing to show him some face and be courteous.</p><p></p><p>Five copper coins was nothing to the town lord's office, just a drop in the bucket.</p><p></p><p>Moreover, the town lord had given them instructions earlier......</p><p></p><p>Seeing this, the common people all looked enviously at Lu Changsheng, for them, five copper coins, while not a lot, was also not a small amount.</p><p></p><p>"No need." </p><p></p><p>Lu Changsheng's expression remained calm, his left hand reaching out from his right sleeve to place a few copper coins in the hands of the town gate guards.</p><p></p><p>He then stepped into the town.</p><p></p><p>The town gate guards snapped out of their daze and looked down at the palm of their hands, seeing exactly five copper coins, and smiled wryly.</p><p></p><p>Well, their calculations were so obvious, the person could probably hear them from a hundred paces away.</p>

        <h1>Chapter 212</h1>
        <div class="content">
            <p>Here is the full English translation of the Chinese excerpt:</p><p></p><p>The second-to-last day. üíõüêôÔºñ‚ùæ≈ûùî•·ªÆÀ£.ƒÜœåùêå‚ôñüò∫</p><p></p><p>When Leiyu and Leiting appeared in Jinglei City, it immediately caused a huge commotion!</p><p></p><p>The current junior sect master and holy maiden of the Great Day Thunder Sect had actually shown up!</p><p></p><p>"Tsk, the battle beyond their level is happening the day after tomorrow, yet the junior sect master and holy maiden still have the heart to come out and play?" </p><p></p><p>"I think you're the one who's seriously ill. Do you think they're from the Carefree Sect? They're from the Great Day Thunder Sect, the mightiest sect in the human domain!!"</p><p></p><p>"That's right, and not to mention, if they're not out playing, are they cultivating? What could they possibly cultivate in just two days? Moreover, this is the style of a great sect, showing that the Great Day Thunder Sect doesn't even consider the Carefree Sect worthy of their attention."</p><p></p><p>"Oh, okay."</p><p></p><p>"......"</p><p></p><p>At the same time,</p><p></p><p>Leiyu and Leiting were strolling down the street, with the two guardians from the Extreme Cold Ice Field following behind them.</p><p></p><p>The streets were bustling with people.</p><p></p><p>Leiyu and Leiting's expressions were quite unpleasant, as they were followed by a dense crowd of people, all looking at them excitedly or with reverence.</p><p></p><p>"Guardian Zhao, disperse these cultivators," Leiyu ordered, sighing helplessly, "It's really troublesome. We just want to go out and relax, but we're being gawked at like monkeys. Isn't that right, sister?"</p><p></p><p>Leiting: "Mm-hmm!"</p><p></p><p>"Yes, junior sect master," </p><p></p><p>The guardian Zhao following Leiyu immediately obeyed the order, quickly surveying the surroundings and shouting, "No one is allowed to follow! If this guardian discovers anyone still following... hehe."</p><p></p><p>As he spoke, a terrifying pressure akin to that of a Celestial Venerable suddenly erupted, vanishing in an instant!</p><p></p><p>The crowd felt their scalps tingle, and fear appeared in their eyes as they scattered in all directions, not daring to continue following.</p><p></p><p>However... after distancing themselves, they still couldn't help but watch from afar.</p><p></p><p>Seeing this, Guardians Zhao and Lin frowned, intending to deal with these cultivators.</p><p></p><p>Leiyu stopped them, a handsome smile appearing on his face: "It's fine, Guardian Zhao. Let them be, as long as they don't get too close."</p><p></p><p>Hearing this, Guardian Zhao sighed inwardly, bowing respectfully: "Yes, junior sect master."</p><p></p><p>Afterwards, the four of them continued strolling down the street, with no dense crowd following behind them anymore, making Leiyu much more comfortable.</p><p></p><p>The main reason was that life in the sect was too boring. The disciples were too respectful towards him, and he didn't have a single person he could chat with comfortably. Even though his temperament was calm, the disciples still kept their distance from him.</p><p></p><p>Not to mention the disciples, even those Celestial Venerables and Immortal Saints were extremely courteous to him!</p><p></p><p>Perhaps, this is the trouble of being the junior sect master of the Great Day Thunder Sect.</p><p></p><p>Involuntarily, Leiyu's thoughts turned to that snowy night in the Extreme Cold Ice Field, and the young man in blue robes by the campfire.</p><p></p><p>Although their interaction was limited, that young man in blue was quite nice.</p><p></p><p>Not only did he not fear Leiyu's identity as the junior sect master of the Great Day Thunder Sect, but he had also generously gifted them a jar of delicious wine that night.</p><p></p><p>And that jar of wine... was truly delicious beyond words!</p><p></p><p>Thinking about it now, Leiyu still couldn't get over the lingering taste.</p><p></p><p>At the time, his sister and the two guardians had also drunk it, and they all praised it endlessly.</p><p></p><p>However, they didn't encounter him again in the central region of the Extreme Cold Ice Field later on.</p><p></p><p>Reminiscing this, Leiyu sighed regretfully.</p><p></p><p>But the next moment, his wandering and indifferent gaze suddenly widened...</p><p></p><p>"Junior sect master, it's him!!" </p><p></p><p>The startled voices of the two guardians suddenly rang in Leiyu and Leiting's ears.</p><p></p><p>Even the originally listless Leiting's eyes lit up!</p><p></p><p>It's him!</p><p></p><p>That night's wine was truly delicious!</p><p></p><p>"What are you shouting about? Of course I've noticed," Leiyu said calmly, a look of delight appearing on his face as he quickly strode towards the wine house.</p><p></p><p>Leiting and the two guardians hurriedly followed.</p><p></p><p>"Heavens, the junior sect master and holy maiden are actually heading towards the Encounter Immortal Pavilion!"</p><p></p><p>"Whew, the business at the Encounter Immortal Pavilion is going to be booming from now on!"</p><p></p><p>"......"</p><p></p><p>Countless discussions arose on the street, and everyone wanted to follow them in, but remembering Guardian Zhao's earlier display, they dared not continue following.</p><p></p><p>Here is the full English translation of the Chinese excerpt:</p><p></p><p>The fierce and malevolent face of the Protector Law was instantly suppressed.</p><p></p><p>It's better not to.</p><p></p><p>The shopkeeper heard the discussion outside, his expression filled with doubt and uncertainty!</p><p></p><p>Is it true? Is the Junior Sect Master really coming towards their restaurant?</p><p></p><p>So he released his divine sense to check, and sure enough, he saw Leiyu and the others walking towards the restaurant!</p><p></p><p>He was stunned for a moment, then immediately delighted, jumping out from behind the counter and rushing towards the entrance!</p><p></p><p>Many of the customers in the restaurant also lowered their voices at this moment, one by one standing up from their seats, watching the entrance of the restaurant with restraint.</p><p></p><p>At this time,</p><p></p><p>The shopkeeper bowed at the entrance, nervous and incoherent.</p><p></p><p>"Junior, Junior Sect Master! Holy, Holy Maiden..."</p><p></p><p>"It's fine." Leiyu smiled and lifted him up with a wave of his hand, then walked into the restaurant.</p><p></p><p>Leiying and the others followed in.</p><p></p><p>Seeing this, the shopkeeper let out a sigh of relief, excitedly rushing in, wanting to attend to Leiyu.</p><p></p><p>But as soon as he entered, he was stunned.</p><p></p><p>Not only him, the customers were also stunned.</p><p></p><p>Because the Junior Sect Master and the Holy Maiden were walking towards the table by the window.</p><p></p><p>And there was someone sitting at that table.</p><p></p><p>Could it be that the Junior Sect Master and the Holy Maiden want to sit at that position?</p><p></p><p>The shopkeeper's thoughts raced, and just as he was about to take a step forward to say something, he was shocked to see Leiyu cupping his hands and smiling at the young man in blue robes,</p><p></p><p>"Fellow Daoist, it has been over five months since we parted on the icy night."</p><p></p><p>Behind him, Leiying and the two Protectors also had smiles on their faces.</p><p></p><p>Because of that jar of wine, they had a good impression of the cultivator in front of them.</p><p></p><p>And through the previous Ice Flame Tiger, they knew this cultivator was very strong.</p><p></p><p>Lu Changsheng glanced at Leiyu and smiled, "Sit."</p><p></p><p>Leiyu was delighted, immediately pulling Leiying to sit down.</p><p></p><p>As for Zhao the Protector and Lin the Protector, they stood to the side.</p><p></p><p>At this moment, the restaurant was silent as the grave.</p><p></p><p>Everyone was so shocked that their eyes were about to pop out!</p><p></p><p>Who is this young man in blue robes? The Junior Sect Master is actually so polite to him!</p><p></p><p>And the Junior Sect Master and the Holy Maiden have come, but the other person doesn't even stand up to welcome them!</p><p></p><p>Especially the shopkeeper, his heart was filled with horror. These past two days, he had already felt that the young man in blue robes was not simple, but he never expected him to be this not simple, even more not simple than he had imagined!</p><p></p><p>Sensing the abnormality, Leiyu frowned and looked at Zhao the Protector, signaling him.</p><p></p><p>Zhao the Protector immediately understood, clearing his throat and sweeping his gaze over the crowd, sternly commanding, "You all sit down and continue drinking, do as you please!"</p><p></p><p>Instantly, the restaurant returned to normal.</p><p></p><p>But the atmosphere was a bit stiff, and everyone kept glancing at Lu Changsheng's side out of the corner of their eyes.</p><p></p><p>...</p><p></p><p>Leiyu and Leiying looked at the young man in front of them, not knowing where to start the conversation, and their expressions became a bit awkward.</p><p></p><p>Lu Changsheng's gaze was indecipherable as he smiled and asked, "Was the wine that night good to drink?"</p><p></p><p>"It was so good, so good! Fellow Daoist, I must tell you, that wine is truly the best I've ever had in my life!" Leiyu nodded quickly, and then looked at Leiying and the others, one by one asking, "Sister, Zhao the Protector, Lin the Protector, isn't that right?"</p><p></p><p>"Yes, yes." The three of them nodded quickly, not being perfunctory.</p><p></p><p>After all, that wine was truly extremely delicious!</p><p></p><p>"If it was good, then good." Lu Changsheng nodded, then suddenly said softly, "Then today... I'll treat you all again."</p><p></p><p>As he spoke, he waved his sleeve, and two jars of Xixian Liquor appeared on the table.</p><p></p><p>The four of them had their eyes shining brightly!</p><p></p><p>"Me, me!" Leiyu was drooling, immediately standing up and arranging five wine cups, ready to pour one by one.</p><p></p><p>Zhao the Protector and Lin the Protector were slightly moved, the Junior Sect Master actually included the two of them and was personally pouring wine for them, truly without any airs.</p><p></p><p>Lu Changsheng looked at the radiant smile on Leiyu's face and said softly, "This may be the last time I treat you to a drink."</p><p></p><p>Leiyu's pouring motion paused.</p>

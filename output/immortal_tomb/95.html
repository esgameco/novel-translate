        <h1>Chapter 95</h1>
        <div class="content">
            <p>Here is the full English translation of the Chinese excerpt:</p><p></p><p>Midnight, Immortal Tomb.</p><p></p><p>Lü Changsheng stood silently in the center of the tomb group, for a very long time.</p><p></p><p>He suddenly looked up at the sky, the corners of his mouth curling into a sharp smile, no longer the gentle expression of the past.</p><p></p><p>"The idea and the means are not bad, but unfortunately, this Emperor is immortal and will only grow stronger. What can you do to me?"</p><p></p><p>Lü Changsheng lowered his head and clenched his fists, chuckling to himself, "Myriad worlds... no one can subdue me, Lü Changsheng."</p><p></p><p>With that, the figure in blue gradually dissipated and disappeared.</p><p></p><p>.........</p><p></p><p>The Four Directions Immortal Realm, the Southern Immortal Realm.</p><p></p><p>When Lü Changsheng slowly emerged from the ascension passage, he saw a turtle shell swaying on the sandy ground, like a rocking chair.</p><p></p><p>He walked over with a smile on his face and stepped on it.</p><p></p><p>The turtle head poked out from the shell, chuckling, "Master, the old turtle has been waiting for you for a few years."</p><p></p><p>The old turtle had been slapped by Lü Changsheng to a very distant place before, and it took him two years to return to this ascension passage. Knowing that Lü Changsheng would come to the Immortal Realm, he didn't go to the Spiritual Dust Realm but waited here at the passage, sleeping along the way, and had been sleeping for five years.</p><p></p><p>Lü Changsheng glanced at the old turtle and moved his foot away.</p><p></p><p>The old turtle quickly expanded his body, respectfully bowing.</p><p></p><p>Lü Changsheng stepped onto the turtle shell and said, "Let's go, no need to hurry."</p><p></p><p>"Hehe, okay, Master."</p><p></p><p>The old turtle rose into the air, his limbs moving like paddling, and quickly disappeared into the vast desert with the human and the turtle.</p><p></p><p>......</p><p></p><p>The Four Directions Immortal Realm is divided into five Immortal Realms, boundless and without edges, and no one knows where the end is.</p><p></p><p>Below the Immortal Realm, there are countless lower realms like the Spiritual Dust Realm, and all the cultivators in the lower realms dream of ascending to the Immortal Realm.</p><p></p><p>Only by reaching the Immortal Realm can the true path of cultivation begin.</p><p></p><p>The Southern Immortal Realm, as one of the Four Directions Immortal Realms, is naturally renowned for its vastness and prosperity.</p><p></p><p>The entire Southern Immortal Realm is divided into three major Immortal Continents, where living beings can be found.</p><p></p><p>One of these Immortal Continents is even more vast than countless Spiritual Dust Realms.</p><p></p><p>They are the Furao Immortal Continent, the Luan Star Immortal Continent, and the Emperor Martial Immortal Continent!</p><p></p><p>Among the three Immortal Continents, there are countless sects and temples, with strict hierarchies, ranging from one to nine stars.</p><p></p><p>The Tian Heng Grand Sect that Lü Changsheng had previously destroyed was just a one-star sect on the edge of the Furao Immortal Continent.</p><p></p><p>...</p><p></p><p>Furao Immortal Continent, Langtian Domain.</p><p></p><p>Lü Changsheng rode on the old turtle and left the desert.</p><p></p><p>A fifty-meter-high city came into view, its grandeur and majesty striking.</p><p></p><p>There were countless streams of light flashing in the sky.</p><p></p><p>In the Immortal Realm, there is no distinction between the secular world and the cultivation world, as cultivators and ordinary people coexist.</p><p></p><p>So the common people in the Four Directions Immortal Realm are used to the sight of cultivators.</p><p></p><p>The old turtle carried Lü Changsheng to the city gate and then transformed into a human form.</p><p></p><p>The passing mortals and cultivators merely glanced at them and then averted their gaze, as they were accustomed to such sights.</p><p></p><p>"Hehe, Master," the old turtle said with a lecherous smile, looking at Lü Changsheng. In the Immortal Realm, he was clearly more excited than in the Spiritual Dust Realm, as there were more things to play with.</p><p></p><p>Lü Changsheng gave him a sidelong glance and strode forward with his hands behind his back.</p><p></p><p>The fully armed city guards saw the two cultivators approaching and were about to stop them, but the old turtle quickly tossed an upper-grade spirit stone at them.</p><p></p><p>"Haha! Welcome to the Sand City, esteemed seniors, please go ahead!"</p><p></p><p>The guards accepted the spirit stone and greeted them warmly.</p><p></p><p>Here is the full English translation of the excerpt from the Chinese novel:</p><p></p><p>Residing in a high-grade spirit stone, his eyes shining brightly, he swallowed his saliva and enthusiastically welcomed Luchang Sheng and the two of them.</p><p></p><p>Absolutely a big shot!</p><p></p><p>The entry fee for two cultivators would normally only require a mid-grade spirit stone, but unexpectedly, the person casually used a high-grade spirit stone! </p><p></p><p>This was enough for two thousand cultivators to enter!</p><p></p><p>"Haha, no need to look for change, Grandpa Turtle has plenty of spirit stones!" The old turtle laughed heartily, striding in with a carefree gait.</p><p></p><p>A few city guards watched Luchang Sheng and the two leave with envious gazes, their eyes filled with admiration.</p><p></p><p>Having money is really great.</p><p></p><p>In the city, on the street, at the noodle shop.</p><p></p><p>"Haha, you two immortals, your noodle soup is ready," the waiter said with a smile as he placed two bowls of noodles in front of Luchang Sheng and the old turtle.</p><p></p><p>"Enjoy at your leisure, let me know if you need anything."</p><p></p><p>The waiter smiled, bowed, and retreated.</p><p></p><p>Facing Luchang Sheng and the old turtle, the waiter's expression was calm and composed, respectful yet natural, as steady as an old dog.</p><p></p><p>If it were in the Mortal Realm, those ordinary people would have worshipped the immortals, and the differences between the immortal and mortal realms would have been immediately apparent.</p><p></p><p>Luchang Sheng picked up his chopsticks, twirled the noodles, and took a bite, lightly chuckling, "Not bad."</p><p></p><p>It was unclear whether he was evaluating the noodles or something else.</p><p></p><p>The old turtle paused in his actions of picking at the noodles. He naturally knew what Luchang Sheng was referring to, and then his eyes rolled as he flattered with a smile, "Master, although some have violated the immortal ascension path you established, the Immortal Emperors still enforce the rule of not allowing cultivators to casually harm ordinary people quite well."</p><p></p><p>Luchang Sheng took a sip of the noodle soup and nodded.</p><p></p><p>Seeing this, the old turtle lowered his head and quietly continued eating, his thoughts drifting.</p><p></p><p>In this immortal realm, among the mortals, the one most revered by the common people was naturally the master before him, the Immortal Emperor Luchang Sheng.</p><p></p><p>There was no other reason, it was simply because of that rule of not allowing cultivators to casually harm ordinary people.</p><p></p><p>Hundreds of millions of years ago, in the eyes of cultivators, mortals were just ants that could be casually stepped on or killed, and their lives were miserable. But after that rule was issued, the happiness index of the mortal realm's people has risen infinitely!</p><p></p><p>"Ah, the Huang, Chen, and Chu immortal clans have been having a hard time lately..."</p><p></p><p>"Who says they aren't? Twelve years ago, the Tian Heng Sect, for some unknown reason, was reduced to ruins within a radius of thousands of miles! I went to the site to take a look back then, it was truly terrifying."</p><p></p><p>"Hmm, some say it was divine retribution, others say it was man-made... There are all kinds of rumors."</p><p></p><p>"Well, this is no small matter, tens of thousands of disciples were lost... I heard the higher-ups sent people to investigate, and in our Langtiandomain, aside from the Tian Heng Sect as the overlord, the three major immortal clans are the next biggest powers, so they will surely investigate the three major clans as well, after all, the three clans together could pose a threat to the Tian Heng Sect."</p><p></p><p>"Haha, ridiculous, not to mention the three clans, even if ten more immortal clans joined forces, they wouldn't have the ability to instantly reduce the entire Tian Heng Sect to ruins!"</p><p></p><p>"Ah, fellow Daoist, everyone understands the logic, but they can't find the culprit, so someone has to take the blame, that's just how it is..."</p><p></p><p>The conversation from the neighboring table flowed into the ears of Luchang Sheng and the old turtle.</p><p></p><p>The old turtle paused, recalling the incident twelve years ago when Luchang Sheng had brought Chu Xieran and Zhang Youdao into the immortal ascension path, and then hesitantly asked, "Master, is the Tian Heng Sect they're talking about the one you..."</p><p></p><p>Luchang Sheng finished the last of his noodles and simply asked, "What?"</p><p></p><p>The old turtle smacked his lips and awkwardly laughed, "Nothing, nothing."</p>

        <h1>Chapter 325</h1>
        <div class="content">
            <p>Here is the full English translation of the Chinese excerpt:</p><p></p><p>"Ah, Elder, what should we do? The Sect Master hasn't returned yet, and without him, we can't advance in the Carefree Technique," Zuochou Shan sighed.</p><p></p><p>"Yes, and the most important thing is, we don't have any wine left..." Su Qianghe grumbled.</p><p></p><p>Hearing this, the four men turned to look at Su Qianghe, their expressions filled with disdain.</p><p></p><p>"Qianghe, it's not that Elder is saying this, but at a time like this, you're still thinking about that drink?" Peng Fang swallowed and said.</p><p></p><p>"Elder, is your throat feeling dry? Are you thirsty?" Su Qianghe asked innocently.</p><p></p><p>"Hmph!" Peng Fang angrily flicked his sleeve, really wanting to give this kid a good beating! But he was afraid that the Sect Master might suddenly return, and this kid would go and tattle on him. He remembered the last time very clearly.</p><p></p><p>Beside them, Zuochou Shan and the others just smiled and didn't say anything.</p><p></p><p>Throughout, among the five Elders, Peng Fang and Su Qianghe didn't get along, Zhao Wurou and Yin Jiuguai didn't get along, and Zuochou Shan remained neutral.</p><p></p><p>"Sigh."</p><p></p><p>Finally, the five of them sighed in unison, their gazes turning towards the training field, and then their pupils suddenly shrank, followed by great joy!</p><p></p><p>That, that is...</p><p></p><p>At the same time, on the training field.</p><p></p><p>Cai Xu and Huang Bin were practicing the Carefree Technique, but suddenly they noticed a young man in blue robes appear in the middle!</p><p></p><p>The two of them abruptly stopped, dumbfounded!</p><p></p><p>The surrounding disciples who were watching Cai Xu and Huang Bin were also stunned, and they rubbed their eyes, thinking they were seeing things.</p><p></p><p>The Sect... Master?</p><p></p><p>"Your cultivation of the first volume of the Carefree Technique still has a long way to go," Lu Changsheng stood with his hands behind his back, speaking softly.</p><p></p><p>"Sect Master!" </p><p></p><p>With the disciples' exclamation, the entire training field fell silent, and all the disciples present looked over in bewilderment.</p><p></p><p>The Sect Master? What Sect Master?</p><p></p><p>But when they saw the young man in blue robes standing in the air, their minds were shaken, and they hurriedly descended from the sky.</p><p></p><p>"Outrageous!! What are you all still standing there for? Hurry and pay your respects!!"</p><p></p><p>Just as the disciples were dazed, the five Elders led by Peng Fang suddenly appeared on the training field.</p><p></p><p>The five Elders first looked at Lu Changsheng with delight, then quickly led the now alert disciples to kneel down.</p><p></p><p>Lu Changsheng moved, and he stood on the ground of the training field, smiling faintly, "Rise."</p><p></p><p>"Yes." The crowd quickly stood up, their gazes burning with admiration as they looked at Lu Changsheng.</p><p></p><p>This was their Sect Master!</p><p></p><p>At this time, Li Shuyan also appeared on the training field, marveling at the scene before him.</p><p></p><p>When he followed Lu Changsheng into the Linglang Heavenly Realm, he found that this place was far inferior to the Ancestral Heavenly Realm.</p><p></p><p>But his master's sect actually had five Transcendent Realm experts. He could tell that the five had reached their limits, and their disciples' cultivation levels were also quite impressive.</p><p></p><p>No wonder this is the sect established by his master.</p><p></p><p>Lu Changsheng looked at Peng Fang and ordered, "Elder, gather all the disciples of the Carefree Sect to assemble here. I have something to say."</p><p></p><p>"Yes!" Peng Fang immediately responded respectfully, then turned and shouted, "The Sect Master has ordered, all disciples of the Carefree Sect are to assemble at the training field!"</p><p></p><p>His words echoed throughout the Carefree Sect.</p><p></p><p>Instantly, the Carefree Sect was shaken!</p><p></p><p>Whether it was the two Holy Sons, Tong Xin and Lin Dong, or the Protector Executives like Zhu Xingqiu, they were all stunned.</p><p></p><p>They never expected the Sect Master to suddenly return.</p><p></p><p>So in a moment, many disciples who were still cultivating quickly withdrew from their cultivation state and hurried towards the training field.</p><p></p><p>Countless streams of light appeared in the sky above the Carefree Sect.</p><p></p><p>"What? The master has returned?"</p><p></p><p>Here is the full English translation of the Chinese excerpt:</p><p></p><p>Inside a cave dwelling, the old turtle suddenly opened his eyes, feeling shocked but also overjoyed. </p><p></p><p>He didn't expect the master to come to the Linlang Heavens so soon.</p><p></p><p>The old turtle then clenched his fists and smiled smugly. During this period, he had abandoned his previous laziness and playboy ways, and had been cultivating madly!</p><p></p><p>Originally, he disliked cultivation very much, as it was too dull and monotonous. But after going to the Ancestral Heavenly Realm, he realized that sometimes one needs to have strength by one's side.</p><p></p><p>He even recalled the scene when Lu Changsheng had thrown him into the Linlang Heavens - how utterly defeated he had felt.</p><p></p><p>But now, he must be able to be of great help to his master, right?</p><p></p><p>Thinking this, the old turtle cleared his throat, hid the lecherous smile on his face, and disappeared from the cave dwelling.</p><p></p><p>...</p><p></p><p>At the training grounds, disciples arrived in batches, all of them respectfully glancing at Lu Changsheng on the high platform before lining up in order of seniority below.</p><p></p><p>With the arrival of Tong Xin, Lin Dong, and the others, the Xiaoyao Sect was finally all gathered.</p><p></p><p>Just then, the old turtle appeared, rushing excitedly towards Lu Changsheng: "Master, I didn't expect you to come to the Linlang Heavens so soon. You don't know, the old turtle has been cultivating so painstakingly during this period. The old turtle's current strength is absolutelyâ€”"</p><p></p><p>Boom!</p><p></p><p>Before the old turtle could finish speaking, he was kicked away by Lu Changsheng with a sidekick.</p><p></p><p>Rumble!</p><p></p><p>He was violently smashed into the distant mountain, causing the ground to tremble. The onlookers were terrified, as they could even feel the faint trembling beneath their feet.</p><p></p><p>The five elders of Peng Fang's legs were shaking, and they were frantically swallowing their saliva.</p><p></p><p>They knew the old turtle's strength all too well - the last time he had emerged, he could easily crush them. This time, he must be even stronger.</p><p></p><p>Yet this powerful old turtle was kicked into such a sorry state by the Sect Master with such ease and indifference...</p><p></p><p>The Sect Master was truly the Sect Master, as invincible as ever.</p><p></p><p>At first, they had thought that by reaching the Divine Origin Realm, they could slightly narrow the gap with the Sect Master. </p><p></p><p>Now they realized that they must have been drinking fake wine and thinking too much.</p><p></p><p>"Boom!"</p><p></p><p>The old turtle burst out from the distant mountain, quickly returning to the training grounds in a disheveled state. He glared angrily at the bewildered onlookers, causing them to hastily avert their gaze.</p><p></p><p>Although the Sect Master could easily deal with Senior Turtle, they themselves could not.</p><p></p><p>Seeing this, the old turtle felt a bit better. He glanced at the lofty Lu Changsheng with a sheepish look, then obediently stood to the side.</p><p></p><p>He suddenly noticed Li Shuo-yan, as the latter's bald head was quite eye-catching, and transmitted a mocking message: "Well, if it isn't Shuo-yan? It's been a while. You've grown stronger while following the master, but also balder?"</p><p></p><p>Li Shuo-yan responded with a friendly smile towards the old turtle.</p><p></p><p>Just as the old turtle was about to transmit something else, Lu Changsheng spoke up from the high platform:</p><p></p><p>"The sole purpose of my return is to lead the Xiaoyao Sect out of the Linlang Heavens."</p><p></p><p>At these words, the disciples on the training grounds exchanged glances, their faces expressing a mix of emotions - excitement, confusion, bewilderment, and reluctance.</p><p></p><p>As for the five elders of Peng Fang and the executive protectors like Zhu Xingqiu, they were overjoyed!</p><p></p><p>Especially Zhu Xingqiu and the others, who had secretly communicated with the five elders and knew about the Xiaoyao Sect's current predicament - they had reached their limit in the Linlang Heavens.</p><p></p><p>They also knew that the five elders had stagnated after reaching the so-called Divine Origin Realm, and continuing to stay in the Linlang Heavens would only waste their time and life.</p><p></p><p>However, they couldn't just let them leave either, for two reasons: one, they were the Xiaoyao Sect's upper echelon and couldn't depart, and two, they themselves didn't know where to go even if they left the Linlang Heavens.</p><p></p><p>Lu Changsheng looked at the expressions of the crowd and smiled slightly. The Xiaoyao Sect could not remain in the Linlang Heavens forever, as he had initially intended to establish the sect and take responsibility for it.</p>

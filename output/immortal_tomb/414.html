        <h1>Chapter 414</h1>
        <div class="content">
            <p>Here is the full English translation of the Chinese excerpt:</p><p></p><p>The City of Heavenly Fragrance, the Mansion of the City Lord.</p><p></p><p>"Poof!!! What?! The Ninth Prince is coming towards the City of Heavenly Fragrance? And the Sage of Music is with him?!"</p><p></p><p>Upon receiving the message, the City Lord Guo Xiong, who was comfortably sipping tea, was shocked and the tea in his mouth sprayed out!</p><p></p><p>Guo Xiong abruptly stood up, his expression changing wildly, his face even turning a bit pale. He was frightened, as he could not understand why the Ninth Prince and Ye Xunwang, figures at the pinnacle of the ancient Kingdom of Yunlan, would come to the small City of Heavenly Fragrance for no apparent reason.</p><p></p><p>Guo Xiong took a deep breath, and then shouted:</p><p></p><p>"Summon someone!"</p><p></p><p>Soon, an old man quickly stepped in from outside the hall. He first looked at Guo Xiong's complexion with surprise and doubt, then slightly bowed and said, "City Lord."</p><p></p><p>Guo Xiong looked at the old man and said worriedly, "Steward, just now we received a message that the Ninth Prince and the Sage of Music are heading towards our City of Heavenly Fragrance."</p><p></p><p>Ah?</p><p></p><p>The Steward was taken aback, evidently also frightened by this sudden news!</p><p></p><p>Seeing the Steward also being frightened, Guo Xiong couldn't help but sigh:</p><p></p><p>"This City Lord really can't figure out why the Ninth Prince and the Sage of Music, such distinguished figures, would come to our City of Heavenly Fragrance for what purpose?"</p><p></p><p>Guo Xiong knew that they were not coming because of him, but he was worried about something else.</p><p></p><p>With such great figures descending upon the City of Heavenly Fragrance, as the City Lord he would definitely have to accompany them.</p><p></p><p>Guo Xiong was afraid that during the accompaniment, some mistakes or lack of discernment might occur, directly leading to his own downfall.</p><p></p><p>It's just like accompanying the emperor, it's the same principle.</p><p></p><p>The Steward frowned and pondered for a moment, then said, "City Lord, didn't you go to the capital city with Zhu Headmaster and Luo Headmaster some time ago?"</p><p></p><p>Guo Xiong was startled, "That's right."</p><p></p><p>The Steward nodded, "City Lord, did you happen to meet the Ninth Prince then?"</p><p></p><p>Guo Xiong said self-mockingly, "The Ninth Prince is such an esteemed person, even if I had the good fortune to see him at a banquet, it would have been only from afar."</p><p></p><p>The Steward said slowly, "Then was Zhu Headmaster always within your sight?"</p><p></p><p>"Hmm..." Guo Xiong was about to nod, but then shook his head, "No, at the time Zhu Headmaster said he was a bit tired and left my sight for a period of time."</p><p></p><p>"Hehe, that's it. City Lord, I understand now."</p><p></p><p>The Steward stroked his beard, his eyes revealing a gleam of insight and comprehension.</p><p></p><p>Oh?</p><p></p><p>Guo Xiong narrowed his eyes, seeming to have also realized something. "Does the Steward's meaning mean..."</p><p></p><p>The Steward nodded, then coldly smiled:</p><p></p><p>"It seems Zhu Headmaster has already sensed that you and Luo Headmaster were going to deal with him, and the trip to the capital city was his only chance... Then the Ninth Prince's notorious lechery, which is well-known throughout the ancient Kingdom of Yunlan, City Lord, what do you think?"</p><p></p><p>Hearing this, Guo Xiong's gaze sharpened: "So this time the Ninth Prince suddenly wants to come to the City of Heavenly Fragrance, it's just for Zhu Qingqing? What a Zhu Headmaster, ruthless enough to even sell his own daughter! "</p><p></p><p>"If Zhu Headmaster successfully gets the Ninth Prince's protection, then our City Lord's Mansion and Luo's Mansion won't be able to touch the Zhu Mansion! Damn it!"</p><p></p><p>After saying this, Guo Xiong felt a bit distressed. In the end, it was his own negligence in the past period that failed to keep a close eye on Zhu Headmaster.</p><p></p><p>He also never imagined that Zhu Headmaster would be so bold as to dare to curry favor with the Ninth Prince, not caring about his own life.</p><p></p><p>The Steward said in a solemn voice, "The City Lord need not worry too much. Judging by the Ninth Prince's tendency to start and abandon, the Zhu Mansion's protection won't last long..."</p><p></p><p>"This, the City Lord already knows. Steward, what I'm worried about now is another matter - will Zhu Headmaster, without restraint, gift the Ninth Prince the Cyan Lotus seeds?" Guo Xiong asked.</p><p></p><p>These Cyan Lotus seeds were the primary reason the City Lord's Mansion and Luo's Mansion wanted to target the Zhu Mansion!</p><p></p><p>Originally in this City of Heavenly Fragrance, the City Lord's Mansion, the Zhu Mansion, and the Luo Mansion...</p><p></p><p>Here is the full English translation of the Chinese excerpt:</p><p></p><p>The three powers - the city, the Zhu family, and the Luo family - were in a relatively balanced state.</p><p></p><p>However, Zhu Guyuan had somehow obtained the extremely precious Qinglian seed, directly disrupting this balance.</p><p></p><p>Although Zhu Guyuan was very discreet, among the three families, which one did not have spies? The secret of the Qinglian seed could not be kept hidden.</p><p></p><p>The Qinglian seed, once planted and carefully nurtured, would grow into a tree in a thousand years and bear fruit in ten thousand years!</p><p></p><p>The legendary Qinglian fruit, it was said that if one could refine just one, it would lay the foundation for reaching the Shenwu Realm!</p><p></p><p>In other words, as long as one cultivated diligently without any mishaps, one would definitely be able to break through to the Shenwu Realm in this lifetime!</p><p></p><p>The Shenwu Realm, in the ancient Yunlan Kingdom, was an existence of the highest order!</p><p></p><p>It was said that the king of the capital was an unparalleled expert of the Shenwu Realm!</p><p></p><p>In this Tiangxiang City, Guo Xiong, Zhu Guyuan, and the Luo family lord were merely Shendao Realm experts. The Shenwu experts were like fairy tales to them.</p><p></p><p>And in the former Shenmo Battlefield, those who had just entered the Shendao Realm were the elite warriors of the myriad tribes, while the Shenyuan Realm experts were the level of most clan leaders.</p><p></p><p>As for the Shenwu Realm, it was the level of the clan leaders of the peak great clans.</p><p></p><p>Therefore, this Qinglian seed was extremely important to Guo Xiong and the Luo family lord.</p><p></p><p>If the Qinglian seed was exposed, it would undoubtedly stir up a bloody storm!</p><p></p><p>Probably the king would be the first to make a move!</p><p></p><p>"City Lord, don't worry. Zhu Guyuan would never give the Qinglian seed, such a priceless treasure, to the Ninth Prince. I believe he would rather destroy it," the Steward comforted, his eyes also burning with desire at the thought of the Qinglian seed.</p><p></p><p>If he could obtain a Qinglian fruit, he would also gain supreme enlightenment!</p><p></p><p>Hearing this, Guo Xiong felt somewhat relieved and sighed, "If it weren't for the rumor that the Qinglian seed can only bear one fruit, we wouldn't have to make such a fuss. Moreover, by the time the second fruit appears, it won't be as simple as a mere ten thousand years, but tens of thousands of years. Who can wait that long?"</p><p></p><p>Tens of thousands of years, too many changes could happen!</p><p></p><p>"City Lord, the Qinglian seed is in Zhu Guyuan's hands and won't get away. Now, we should prepare to welcome the arrival of the Ninth Prince and the Qin Saint," the Steward said solemnly.</p><p></p><p>"Mm." Guo Xiong suddenly remembered something and asked curiously, "By the way, Steward, have you recently heard any news about a Qin Immortal appearing in our Tiangxiang City?"</p><p></p><p>The Steward shook his head and smiled, "City Lord, of course I've heard about it, but I think it's just a skilled musician, so I haven't paid much attention to it."</p><p></p><p>Guo Xiong shook his head, "I didn't mean anything by mentioning this so-called Qin Immortal. I just hope that when the Qin Saint arrives, there won't be any trouble..."</p><p></p><p>"City Lord means..." The Steward began to understand.</p><p></p><p>The Steward guessed that the City Lord was afraid that when the Ninth Prince and the Qin Saint arrived, they might hear about this Qin Immortal and be displeased.</p><p></p><p>"Steward, you shall issue an order throughout the city that all citizens must be ready to welcome the Ninth Prince with the utmost enthusiasm. Also, dispatch the city guards to spread red carpets and hang banners starting from a hundred paces outside the city gate."</p><p></p><p>Guo Xiong narrowed his eyes and continued, "Finally, pass on my decree that from today onwards, no one in the city is allowed to discuss this so-called Qin Immortal! Then try to find this Qin Immortal and drive them out of the city before the arrival of the Ninth Prince and the Qin Saint!"</p><p></p><p>The Steward bowed, "City Lord, rest assured."</p>

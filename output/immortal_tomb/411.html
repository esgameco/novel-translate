        <h1>Chapter 411</h1>
        <div class="content">
            <p>Here is the full English translation of the Chinese excerpt:</p><p></p><p>The teahouse fell into silence.</p><p></p><p>The others did not dare to look at the distraught Zhu Qingqing, and quickly left the teahouse.</p><p></p><p>If it were someone else who failed to win over the Qin Xian, the others might have mocked them, but the target was Zhu Qingqing, even if they had a thousand times the courage, they still wouldn't dare.</p><p></p><p>"Miss..."</p><p></p><p>Xiao Lian hesitated, wanting to comfort her but not knowing how to start.</p><p></p><p>Zhu Qingqing shook her head, tightened the scroll in her hand, and sighed, "Let's go."</p><p></p><p>At the same time, outside the teahouse.</p><p></p><p>Luo Lingyan arrived late, and upon learning that Qin Xian had left, she became furious and frantic.</p><p></p><p>However, after learning that Zhu Qingqing had been rejected, her mood improved significantly.</p><p></p><p>Through this incident, Luo Lingyan gained more confidence, since Qin Xian did not like the gentle type like Zhu Qingqing, he must like the lively and cheerful type like herself!</p><p></p><p>When Qin Xian appears next time, she will definitely seize the opportunity.</p><p></p><p>Thinking of this, Luo Lingyan couldn't help but smile continuously, in a great mood.</p><p></p><p>Luo Lingyan had originally planned to mock Zhu Qingqing, but Zhu Qingqing had already left, so she could only give up helplessly, and then waved her hand to leave with her servants.</p><p></p><p>...</p><p></p><p>In the following few days, the matter of the young miss of the Zhu family being rejected by Qin Xian became a topic of discussion after meals in Tianxiang City.</p><p></p><p>Of course, everyone only dared to discuss it in private, not daring to bring it up openly.</p><p></p><p>Nevertheless, this matter still reached the Zhu family, and was known to Zhu Qingqing's parents.</p><p></p><p>In the Zhu family's main hall.</p><p></p><p>Bang.</p><p></p><p>Zhu Guoyuan slammed the wine glass heavily on the table, his face dark as he said, "Go and summon the young miss."</p><p></p><p>"Yes, master." </p><p></p><p>The steward trembled slightly, bowing and leaving.</p><p></p><p>Next to him, Lady Zhu looked at Zhu Guoyuan's gloomy face and sighed helplessly, "Guoyuan, when the young miss comes, you must speak kindly to her, don't make a sour face."</p><p></p><p>Zhu Guoyuan shook his head, gesturing for Lady Zhu to be quiet.</p><p></p><p>Seeing this, Lady Zhu sighed.</p><p></p><p>Soon, the steward and Zhu Qingqing entered the hall one after the other.</p><p></p><p>"Master, Madam, the young miss has arrived."</p><p></p><p>The steward bowed and left discreetly.</p><p></p><p>Zhu Qingqing first bowed to Zhu Guoyuan and Lady Zhu, then asked, "Father, Mother, why have you summoned me?"</p><p></p><p>In fact, when she saw her father's gloomy expression, she had already guessed what was going on.</p><p></p><p>Sure enough, Zhu Guoyuan slammed the table angrily and scolded, "At this moment, there are all kinds of rumors about you circulating in the city, completely tarnishing the reputation of our Zhu family!"</p><p></p><p>Zhu Qingqing trembled, and Lady Zhu was also startled by the sudden outburst. She first gave Zhu Qingqing a comforting look, then looked at Zhu Guoyuan with a hint of reproach, "Guoyuan, can't you speak to Qingqing properly?"</p><p></p><p>"Hmph, speak properly?" Zhu Guoyuan still had an unpleasant expression, staring at Zhu Qingqing and saying sternly, "As the young miss of the Zhu family, to publicly show affection for a mere musician, it has completely tarnished the reputation of our Zhu family! And what's more, hehe... you were even rejected? Disgraceful!!"</p><p></p><p>Towards the end, if it weren't for Lady Zhu's presence, Zhu Guoyuan would have loved to slap Zhu Qingqing across the face.</p><p></p><p>Zhu Qingqing's expression changed slightly, but she still remained silent and lowered her head, as the matter was as it was, and she had nothing to defend. After all, she was not the type to argue.</p><p></p><p>"Qingqing, your father is harsh in words but soft in heart, you don't need to take his words to heart..." Lady Zhu said worriedly.</p><p></p><p>Zhu Qingqing remained silent with her head lowered.</p><p></p><p>Seeing Zhu Qingqing like a mute, Zhu Guoyuan became even more furious, and roared, "Normally, there are so many young masters you look down upon, and now, you have simply gone mad, actually taking a fancy to someone of low status and position!"</p><p></p><p>Here is the full English translation of the Chinese excerpt:</p><p></p><p>"The musician!!" </p><p></p><p>Zhu Qingqing's heart trembled, and she finally spoke up to refute, "The Qin Immortal is not a lowly musician!"</p><p></p><p>Zhu Guyuan paused, then sneered, "If I say he's just a musician, and you immediately defend him, you really are a girl who can't be kept at home!"</p><p></p><p>Hearing this, Zhu Qingqing fell silent again.</p><p></p><p>Seeing this, Zhu Guyuan coldly said, "Still the 'Qin Immortal'? He's just a musician with slightly better skills, how dare he claim the title of Qin Immortal? In our ancient Yunlan Kingdom, in our heaven and earth where martial arts are revered, he has no status!"</p><p></p><p>"If you say that musician is on par with the Qin Saint of the Yunlan Palace, accomplished in both civil and martial arts, then of course I wouldn't dare say anything, I would even wholeheartedly agree. But he's just a small-time musician, does he deserve it?"</p><p></p><p>"Moreover, even the great Qin Saint wouldn't look highly upon you, a young lady of a small town's Zhu family!"</p><p></p><p>Hearing the name of the Qin Saint, Zhu Qingqing's gaze changed slightly.</p><p></p><p>The Qin Saint Ye Xunwang of the Yunlan Palace, who was renowned throughout the ancient Yunlan Kingdom, who would not have heard of him?</p><p></p><p>He was a master who performed exclusively for the kingdom's royal banquets, rumored to even be on brotherly terms with the Yunlan King.</p><p></p><p>But such a great figure was far too distant from them.</p><p></p><p>The people of Tianxiang City bestowed the title of "Qin Immortal" on Lu Changsheng, precisely because of Ye Xunwang of the ancient Yunlan Kingdom.</p><p></p><p>Since there was already a Qin Saint, they naturally did not dare to call Lu Changsheng the Qin Saint, so they could only call him the Qin Immortal.</p><p></p><p>But in fact, the Qin Saint represented the highest honor, the meaning was also very straightforward, the number one in the world of Qin.</p><p></p><p>Zhu Qingqing felt a bit resentful!</p><p></p><p>Although Ye Xunwang was revered as the Qin Saint, his music was heard by very few people, and no one in Tianxiang City had ever heard it.</p><p></p><p>She only knew that the performance and music of the Qin Immortal were what she had truly witnessed and heard, and were the most unforgettable!</p><p></p><p>She just couldn't bear to see the Qin Immortal being compared unfavorably.</p><p></p><p>Although her confession was rejected, so what? </p><p></p><p>Zhu Qingqing was not the kind of person who would hate someone just because she was rejected in public.</p><p></p><p>"I know of the Qin Saint, but I have never heard his performance, so I don't dare say his skills are superior to the Qin Immortal. Father, have you heard him play?" Zhu Qingqing asked calmly.</p><p></p><p>Zhu Guyuan was taken aback, then suddenly erupted in rage and slapped Zhu Qingqing's face, shouting, "Insolent!"</p><p></p><p>Zhu Qingqing covered her face, expressionless.</p><p></p><p>Seeing this, Zhu's mother hurriedly stepped forward to support Zhu Qingqing, also somewhat angered, "Guyuan, you can just talk, why hit her?"</p><p></p><p>Zhu Guyuan saw Zhu Qingqing's expression, his gaze flickering, hesitant to speak further.</p><p></p><p>After a moment, Zhu Guyuan's eyes narrowed, and he coldly said, "This time when you go to the capital with the City Lord, I have already introduced you to the Ninth Prince. The Ninth Prince will be coming to visit soon, go prepare well!"</p><p></p><p>Zhu Qingqing's eyes changed, looking at Zhu Guyuan with disbelief.</p><p></p><p>It was Zhu's mother who had known this all along, seeing Zhu Qingqing's expression, she could only sigh helplessly in her heart.</p><p></p><p>Although she was Zhu Qingqing's biological mother, in this Zhu family, all major matters were still decided by Zhu Guyuan.</p><p></p><p>Zhu Guyuan looked at Zhu Qingqing's expression, his tone softening a bit, saying, "Qingqing, if the Ninth Prince takes a liking to you, that will be your blessing, and also the blessing of our Zhu family. Moreover, the Ninth Prince is willing to come in person to see you, this is already greatly honoring our Zhu family."</p><p></p><p>"At that time, you must perform well. If you can win the Ninth Prince's favor, our Zhu family may not have to remain in this corner of Tianxiang City, and it's not impossible for us to have a place in that prosperous capital."</p>

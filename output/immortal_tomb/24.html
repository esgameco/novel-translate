        <h1>Chapter 24</h1>
        <div class="content">
            <p>Here is the full English translation of the Chinese excerpt:</p><p></p><p>A strange silence had enveloped the town of Moyu, both inside and out. üíõüêúÔºñ‚ûàùî∞ÔΩà‚ìä‚ìç.·ëïùê®‚ìúüíã‚ôü</p><p></p><p>Everyone stared in awe at the blue-robed man who had appeared out of thin air.</p><p></p><p>Those with keen eyes noticed that since the blue-robed man had appeared, the raging winds had stopped, the rumbling thunder in the sky had ceased, and the dark clouds had dispersed.</p><p></p><p>The moonlight shone down, blanketing the ground in a silver glow.</p><p></p><p>"Sir!"</p><p>"Immortal!"</p><p></p><p>On the town walls, Chen Dadao, the King of Lishui, and the officials were all beaming with joy, their hope reignited.</p><p></p><p>"Senior..." Tongxin hovered in the air, standing on a long sword, muttering in a daze.</p><p></p><p>It was only then that everyone realized the terrifying Abyss Spear was still there, and they quickly turned their gaze towards it.</p><p></p><p>They were then stunned to see the Abyss Spear, with its fierce and ruthless aura, hovering behind the blue-robed man... trembling violently, unable to advance even an inch!</p><p></p><p>Or rather, it seemed to be so terrified that it dared not approach!</p><p></p><p>At the same time, high in the sky, Gu Helin was shocked to see the stationary Abyss Spear behind the blue-robed man, and then his gaze stiffly shifted to the man, dryly saying, "Se-Senior..."</p><p></p><p>Before Gu Helin could finish, Lu Changsheng turned and looked at the trembling Black-Tongue Demon Tribe Leader, his gaze devoid of any emotion, as if he were looking at mere ants...</p><p></p><p>This indifferent gaze made the already terrified Black-Tongue Demon Tribe Leader shudder even more!</p><p></p><p>They had lost the will to fight the moment the Abyss Spear was intercepted. They might not be particularly intelligent, but they were certainly not fools!</p><p></p><p>The mysterious blue-robed man before them was too enigmatic! To be able to stop their Abyss Spear, he must be at least an Elixir Patriarch in the Immortal Cultivation World!</p><p></p><p>"Wh-Who are you, sir?" the Black-Tongue Demon Tribe Leader asked, trying to sound calm, but not daring to look directly into those eyes.</p><p></p><p>After a few moments of silence, the Black-Tongue Demon Tribe Leader was drenched in cold sweat, the pressure too great.</p><p></p><p>Lu Changsheng looked at him quietly, not even intending to converse with this demonic creature.</p><p></p><p>"Tribe Leader, let's flee! If we stay like this..." one of the Black-Tongue Demon high-ranking members whispered urgently.</p><p></p><p>The Black-Tongue Demon Tribe Leader glanced down at the glowing sphere, where dozens of his tribe members were still trapped.</p><p></p><p>Gritting his teeth, he said, "Retreat!"</p><p></p><p>The next moment, a black mist rolled, and their five demonic bodies rapidly retreated, trying to escape.</p><p></p><p>As they retreated, the Black-Tongue Demon Tribe Leader gestured towards the Abyss Spear in front of Lu Changsheng, trying to summon it back.</p><p></p><p>This was a demonic treasure of the Abyss Demon King, and he had only borrowed it for this occasion. He had to retrieve it!</p><p></p><p>But to his horror, no matter how he tried to summon it, the Abyss Spear remained unresponsive.</p><p></p><p>"Damn it! This demonic treasure belongs to the Demon King. If you're not afraid of death, then keep it! Let's go!"</p><p></p><p>The Black-Tongue Demon Tribe Leader had no time to think about anything else, and with a stern warning, he attempted to flee this space.</p><p></p><p>Seeing this, everyone was overjoyed! These demonic creatures had been intimidated and were now trying to escape.</p><p></p><p>"Senior, they're trying to run..." Before Gu Helin could finish his urgent warning,</p><p></p><p>Lu Changsheng's spiritual sense moved.</p><p></p><p>Boom!!!!</p><p></p><p>At the same time,</p><p></p><p>the five Black-Tongue Demons were blown apart like black fireworks in the moonlight, not even having a chance to scream...</p><p></p><p>Only a dull explosion echoed through the night sky.</p><p></p><p>...</p><p></p><p>Gu Helin was stunned...</p><p></p><p>What kind of technique was this? There wasn't even a trace of spiritual energy fluctuation, and those five Black-Tongue Demons were just... gone.</p><p></p><p>The hovering Tongxin also felt suffocated for a moment.</p><p></p><p>Only cultivators like them could truly understand how terrifying that scene had been.</p><p></p><p>Below, the King of Lishui and the officials had been completely silenced, their eyes wide open, struggling to regain their composure. They finally understood the true meaning of Chen Dadao's words about this immortal being able to slaughter the demons.</p><p></p><p>It was so quick and ruthless!</p><p></p><p>And at this moment, even Chen Dadao himself was dumbfounded!</p><p></p><p>Here is the full English translation of the excerpt from the Chinese novel:</p><p></p><p>He had never seen the Master slaying demons before, it was the Master's words that told him so. He did not know the Master's so-called "slaying of demons" was such a way of slaying.</p><p></p><p>With just one move, no, he didn't even see any action, didn't see any brilliant immortal techniques, those demons just exploded in a strange way...</p><p></p><p>...</p><p></p><p>At this time, Lu Changsheng gently kicked the Abyss Demon Spear.</p><p></p><p>With a swoosh, the Abyss Demon Spear turned into a black light and retreated into the backyard of the Prefect's Mansion, without a sound.</p><p></p><p>Lu Changsheng glanced at the light ball below, then glanced at the dazed Gu Helin and said lightly, "The remaining minor demons..."</p><p></p><p>"Senior, don't worry, Helin can handle it!" Gu Helin quickly recovered and hurriedly patted his chest.</p><p></p><p>Lu Changsheng nodded, then slowly dissipated.</p><p></p><p>Seeing Lu Changsheng disappear mysteriously again, the awakened King of theÈõ¢Ê∞¥ Nation hurriedly took the lead and knelt down, roaring, "We, thank the Immortal for the great kindness of saving our lives!"</p><p></p><p>All the people present also hurriedly fell to their knees in gratitude, chanting in unison, "Thank the Immortal for the great kindness of saving our lives!!"</p><p></p><p>The clear and orderly voices resounded through the black night, unceasing!</p><p></p><p>Gu Helin and Tongxin looked at this scene, their hearts filled with endless emotion.</p><p></p><p>But at this moment, Lu Changsheng's calm voice sounded from the Moyu Town, "Noisy or not."</p><p></p><p>Suddenly, the air fell silent, and all sounds inside and outside the town ceased!</p><p></p><p>Gu Helin, Tongxin, Chen Dadao, the King of the Èõ¢Ê∞¥ Nation, and the others had a slight change in their expressions, and a sheepish smile appeared on their faces...</p><p></p><p>After the initial panic, the commoners became extremely excited!</p><p></p><p>The Immortal was actually in this Moyu Town?</p><p></p><p>"No need to thank me, I just felt it was a bit noisy, the one you should thank is someone else." </p><p></p><p>At this time, Lu Changsheng's voice suddenly sounded again from the town...</p><p></p><p>Gu Helin's face stiffened.</p><p></p><p>The King of the Èõ¢Ê∞¥ Nation and the officials and commoners were stunned for a moment, but in an instant they knew who Lu Changsheng was referring to.</p><p></p><p>They couldn't help but look up at the sky at the dazed Gu Helin, remembering his fearless act earlier, and their hearts tightened slightly.</p><p></p><p>The next moment, all the people inside and outside the town knelt down in unison, silently paying respects to the bewildered Gu Helin.</p><p></p><p>"Gu... Gu..."</p><p></p><p>Gu Helin's eyes reddened, not knowing what to say for a moment, then a smile appeared on his face, feeling that everything was worth it.</p><p></p><p>Finally, he couldn't help but look towards the direction of the Prefect's Mansion in Moyu Town, and after a moment, he respectfully bowed, silently saying in his heart, "Thank you, Senior."</p><p></p><p>Tongxin, who was watching the Gu Helin in the sky, also smiled happily, and then looked at the direction of the Prefect's Mansion with reverence. This trip to the mundane world had been fruitful for him.</p><p></p><p>...</p><p></p><p>At midnight, under the command of the many officials, the commoners quickly settled into the tents to rest.</p><p></p><p>With the image of the powerful young man in blue flashing in their minds, they knew that the night ahead would be the most comfortable and peaceful sleep they've had in a long time, for they felt a sense of security.</p><p></p><p>The King of the Èõ¢Ê∞¥ Nation and the officials also quietly entered the Prefect's Mansion to rest...</p><p></p><p>As for the remaining second-level demonic beasts, they had already been cleaned up by Gu Helin and Tongxin.</p><p></p><p>The night finally fell into complete silence, with the sound of snoring echoing in many tents...</p><p></p><p>On the town wall, </p><p>Gu Helin and Tongxin were sitting cross-legged, but neither of them were cultivating, but rather keeping their eyes open.</p><p></p><p>Tongxin swept his gaze over the countless tents and smiled, "Master, in the future, the commoners of the Èõ¢Ê∞¥ Empire will probably all know of our existence as cultivators."</p><p></p><p>Gu Helin smiled faintly, "What's the harm in that? It will be known sooner or later."</p><p></p><p>After the previous events, he knew that the Demon Realm would definitely cause trouble.</p><p></p><p>After all, the Abyss Demon King had even lent the Abyss Demon Spear, a demonic treasure, to the Black Tongue Demon Tribe...</p><p></p><p>Tongxin also vaguely understood Gu Helin's meaning at this moment, and then softly said, "Master, when shall we return to the sect and report this matter to the Sect Master for discussion?"</p><p></p><p>Gu Helin took a light breath and looked towards the direction of the Immortal Mausoleum, his eyes flickering, "Tonight, wait until my master's injuries inside have improved a bit, then we'll return to the sect. We'll come back to Moyu Town in a few days."</p><p></p><p>"Understood." Tongxin responded respectfully and reverently, "With the Guardian of the Immortal Realm here, this place is definitely very safe."</p><p></p><p>"Hehe." Gu Helin sighed reverently.</p><p></p><p>Tongxin suddenly said, "Master, the Senior is very good."</p><p></p><p>Gu Helin paused for a moment, then smiled, "Yes, he is."</p>

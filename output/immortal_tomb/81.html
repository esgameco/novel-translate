        <h1>Chapter 81</h1>
        <div class="content">
            <p>Here is the full English translation of the excerpt from the Chinese novel:</p><p></p><p>At this moment, the area outside the Xiaoyao Courtyard was deathly silent!</p><p></p><p>After a gentle breeze blew by, the crowd shuddered violently. ‚òú‚úå6‚ùæÀ¢ùêá«óùï©.·ëïùëúùê¶‚ô†‚ôî</p><p></p><p>Countless gazes were focused on the young man in green robes.</p><p></p><p>"Crane, Crane Lin, this... this senior in green, who exactly is he...?"</p><p></p><p>The Grand Elder smacked his lips, asking with difficulty.</p><p></p><p>Ancient Crane Lin sluggishly shook his head, even though he knew that Lu Changsheng was a powerful figure from the Immortal Realm, he was still shocked, for what had just happened was simply too unbelievable.</p><p></p><p>He inwardly doubted, are the experts from the Immortal Realm really this mysterious?</p><p></p><p>If he had displayed some brilliant immortal techniques, Ancient Crane Lin could have accepted it.</p><p></p><p>But the reality was that there was no movement or fluctuation at all, a Tribulation Crossing cultivator was just terrifyingly annihilated into nothingness...</p><p></p><p>On the other side, Chu Xirou was even more shocked than Ancient Crane Lin, because she came from the Immortal Realm herself.</p><p></p><p>She asked herself sincerely, she had never seen such a method before.</p><p></p><p>Or was her knowledge just too limited...</p><p></p><p>Chu Xirou looked at Lu Changsheng, this young man in green had instantly become unfathomably mysterious in her eyes...</p><p></p><p>The cultivators' faces were pale, their gazes flickering. They knew that after today, the Spiritual Dust Cultivation Realm would no longer belong to the four great leaders - Jiang Yuan, Qin Miaomiao, Zhang Youdao, and Liu Wusu...</p><p></p><p>The true peak expert was only one person, and that was the mysterious young man before them!</p><p></p><p>Lu Changsheng, disregarding the numerous Nascent Soul and Tribulation Crossing cultivators who were frozen in place, walked straight to the center.</p><p></p><p>Old Turtle saw this and flickered, appearing behind Lu Changsheng, and with a flip of his hand, placed a stool down.</p><p></p><p>Lu Changsheng slowly sat down and asked kindly, "May I sit here?"</p><p></p><p>A pin drop silence fell, with no one daring to respond.</p><p></p><p>Old Turtle furrowed his brows and swept his gaze across the crowd, sternly shouting, "My master asked if he can sit here, are you all deaf?"</p><p></p><p>The crowd immediately trembled,</p><p></p><p>"Of course the senior can sit here... if the senior cannot sit, then who in the world can?"</p><p></p><p>"That's right, it is the honor of us all for the senior to sit here with us."</p><p></p><p>"Yes, I've long disliked that demonic cultivator Duan Jiumo, I'm grateful the senior has eliminated this demonic head for us. This merit will echo through the ages!"</p><p></p><p>"..."</p><p></p><p>The Nascent Soul, Transcendence, and Tribulation Crossing cultivators all spoke up, their faces filled with smiles, but how sincere they were, no one knew...</p><p></p><p>The numerous Foundation Establishment and lower cultivators on the outer perimeter watched the powerful cultivators spouting nonsense, sighing deeply in their hearts.</p><p></p><p>From their initial confusion, doubt, and mockery, to the current awe-inspiring presence of the young man in green.</p><p></p><p>Ultimately... power is the most direct authority!</p><p></p><p>Lu Changsheng smiled: "Then that's good, all of you sit down, no need to be so restrained."</p><p></p><p>"Thank you, senior!"</p><p></p><p>The crowd did not dare to delay, quickly sitting down cross-legged, eyes observing intently.</p><p></p><p>Outside the Xiaoyao Courtyard, although it was crowded with people, it had fallen into a long silence.</p><p></p><p>Dong! Dong! Dong! Dong! Dong!</p><p></p><p>At this moment, five solemn bell tolls resounded through the heavens and earth from within the Xiaoyao Courtyard!</p><p></p><p>The crowd heard it and their eyes lit up!</p><p></p><p>Soon after, they saw the Xiaoyao Courtyard's main gate thunderously open, and countless elders and disciples in Xiaoyao Courtyard attire streamed out, lining up on both sides in a straight formation!</p><p></p><p>The next moment, a unified voice echoed.</p><p></p><p>"The Ascension Ceremony has begun, welcoming the Patriarch!"</p><p></p><p>Instantly, all the seated figures on the plaza stood up, looking up towards the stone platform with rapt attention!</p><p></p><p>Only to see four figures materializing on top of it!</p><p></p><p>Here is the full English translation of the Chinese excerpt:</p><p></p><p>The leader was Zhang Youdao, with Jiang Yuan, Qin Miaomiao, and Liu Wusu following behind him.</p><p></p><p>"Haha, you all have come from afar to attend the Ascension Ceremony. Zhang is deeply honored!" </p><p></p><p>Zhang Youdao laughed heartily.</p><p></p><p>Hearing this, the crowd below stirred excitedly, and many Tribulation Transcending Cultivators cupped their hands and said with a smile, </p><p></p><p>"Fellow Daoist Zhang, you are too polite. The path of immortality is arduous, and we should support each other. Since this is the final leg of your journey in the mortal realm, we must see you off!"</p><p></p><p>"Indeed, we have already reached the initial and middle stages of the Tribulation. In the future, we may also reach this step. We are grateful for the opportunity to witness your Ascension Tribulation."</p><p></p><p>"Fellow Daoist Zhang, rest assured. To repay you for allowing us to witness your Ascension, we will properly take care of your Carefree Abode in the future!"</p><p></p><p>Hearing this, Zhang Youdao nodded in satisfaction.</p><p></p><p>"Hmm?"</p><p></p><p>Jiang Yuan suddenly noticed the figure in blue robes sitting at the front-most bench below, feeling slightly surprised. Upon closer inspection, his gaze shifted!</p><p></p><p>This person, he seemed familiar...</p><p></p><p>Soon, he recalled the scene a few years ago when he had searched Shen Miaoyun's soul at the Azure Cloud Sect!</p><p></p><p>"It's him?"</p><p></p><p>Before he could ponder further, he also saw Chu Xiruo standing beside him, and his body immediately trembled!</p><p></p><p>The Proprietor of the Nameless Tavern had also come!</p><p></p><p>Jiang Yuan had a very deep impression of this Nameless Tavern Proprietor. In the past, when he had failed to carve words on the peculiar signboard and wanted to directly obtain the Azure Sea Immortal Celestial Liquor, he had ended up being rebuked by this person.</p><p></p><p>"Fellow Daoist Jiang, what's wrong?" Qin Miaomiao, noticing Jiang Yuan's unusual behavior, asked in confusion.</p><p></p><p>Liu Wusu also curiously looked over.</p><p></p><p>Seeing this, Jiang Yuan's gaze flickered, and he slightly nodded towards the lower area, saying, "Look, that Cultivator in blue robes is sitting in the front row, with an attendant serving him. His status seems even higher than ours."</p><p></p><p>Oh?</p><p></p><p>Qin Miaomiao and Liu Wusu lowered their heads to look, and their expressions turned surprised.</p><p></p><p>Zhang Youdao also looked down at Lu Changsheng with amazement, but at the moment, he had no time to say more, as he needed to deliver a speech.</p><p></p><p>"Zhang has cultivated the Dao for over four thousand years, and the remaining lifespan is not much. During this time, I have experienced excitement, melancholy, despair, and rebirth!"</p><p></p><p>"Today, if I succeed in the Tribulation, it will be another rebirth for Zhang, and the most important one!"</p><p></p><p>The people below listened attentively, their eyes filled with admiration, reverence, and aspiration, for they knew what it meant to transcend the Tribulation.</p><p></p><p>Unnoticed, the sky gradually darkened...</p><p></p><p>The Tribulation clouds gathered, and the rumbling of thunder began. An unprecedented, majestic Heavenly Might descended from the sky!</p><p></p><p>Clang!!!</p><p></p><p>At this moment, the bell in the Carefree Abode rang out!</p><p></p><p>The time to undergo the Tribulation had arrived!</p><p></p><p>"Fellow Daoists Jiang, Qin, and Liu, I rely on you to guard me today!!!"</p><p></p><p>Zhang Youdao's face was grave, and with a fierce shout, he flashed into the high sky!</p><p></p><p>Jiang Yuan and the others quickly scattered, forming a triangular formation to guard the area around Zhang Youdao's Tribulation zone!</p><p></p><p>The Tribulation Lightning would not tolerate any interference!</p><p></p><p>The people below also quickly sat down, gazing up with nervous anticipation. The Ascension Tribulation of Zhang Youdao was particularly beneficial for Cultivators at the Nascent Soul stage and above.</p><p></p><p>"This Cultivator's aptitude is average. His Ascension Tribulation should not be too fierce. As long as he is well-prepared, he should be able to overcome it," the old turtle behind Lu Changsheng said, stroking his beard after observing Qin Miaomiao.</p><p></p><p>"Fellow Daoist Turtle's words are correct. Judging from the condensation of the Tribulation clouds, it should be the Nine-Nine Purple Lightning Tribulation. Higher-level Tribulations are unlikely to appear," Chu Xiruo said with a smile.</p>

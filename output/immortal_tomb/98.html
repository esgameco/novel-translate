        <h1>Chapter 98</h1>
        <div class="content">
            <p>Here is the full English translation of the Chinese excerpt:</p><p></p><p>Day 1.</p><p></p><p>Even many cultivators from other cities had come all the way to the Sand City to investigate the matter of the three major immortal clans accusing the Eternal Sect. The streets and alleys were bustling with countless figures.</p><p></p><p>Not many people were stupid, as most were well aware that the destruction of the Eternal Sect had nothing to do with the three major immortal clans - it was just finding a scapegoat.</p><p></p><p>However, even if they knew, they dared not speak out, fearing that if the news reached the inspectors, it would bring them deadly trouble... </p><p></p><p>These days, it's best to just mind one's own business.</p><p></p><p>The mighty Inspection Hall was not to be trifled with.</p><p></p><p>In any case, the Sand City had rarely been this lively before.</p><p></p><p>Day 2.</p><p></p><p>The population flow in the Sand City reached its peak, with all the restaurants completely packed.</p><p></p><p>Some even rented out entire restaurants by spending a large amount of spirit stones, then resold the rooms at high prices, making a huge profit.</p><p></p><p>When the restaurants were not enough, countless cultivators could only sit in the open on the central square or the streets, waiting for the arrival of the third day.</p><p></p><p>As for Lu Changsheng and the old turtle, they had already taken up residence near the central square the day before. Worried that Lu Changsheng would be disturbed, the old turtle had splurged and rented an entire restaurant.</p><p></p><p>This made many cultivators who wanted to stay in the restaurants sigh, "What a big shot!"</p><p></p><p>But there was no trouble, as whoever arrived first and had the money to rent an entire restaurant had the right to do so.</p><p></p><p>However, Lu Changsheng had the old turtle let those cultivators in, as there were still many rooms available.</p><p></p><p>The old turtle reluctantly complied, and the cultivators moved in. Hearing that the old turtle was treating them, they were deeply moved and felt grateful.</p><p></p><p>Many were just trying to seize the opportunity to earn spirit stones, but this hunchbacked old man not only did not raise the prices, but even provided them with free accommodation? </p><p></p><p>What a kind-hearted person!</p><p></p><p>If it were many of them, they would have definitely taken advantage of the situation.</p><p></p><p>Regarding this, the old turtle simply said, "Hah, if the master didn't allow you to stay, do you think this old turtle would invite you bunch of trash?"</p><p></p><p>Immediately, the cultivators' expressions turned sour... How arrogant!</p><p></p><p>But they had to swallow their pride, as they didn't want to offend their host.</p><p></p><p>Hmph, for the sake of their master, they wouldn't stoop to the level of this old geezer!</p><p></p><p>Day 3.</p><p></p><p>The Sand City had become noticeably quieter.</p><p></p><p>Many ordinary people had already shut themselves in their homes, not venturing out today.</p><p></p><p>While cultivators would not randomly attack ordinary people due to the immortal laws, the battles between cultivators could be terrifying, and the ordinary people might end up accidentally injured or even killed.</p><p></p><p>So it was better for them to stay at home obediently, even though they were eager to witness the excitement.</p><p></p><p>The cultivators exchanged knowing glances, as today was the day the three major immortal clans were to be held accountable.</p><p></p><p>"The three major immortal clans have arrived!"</p><p></p><p>Someone's low exclamation quickly spread through the streets and alleys.</p><p></p><p>Immediately, the seated cultivators stood up, and those staying in the restaurants poked their heads out of the windows. Some even directly took to the skies to get a bird's-eye view.</p><p></p><p>The next moment, hundreds of powerful auras surged from above the city walls, heading straight for the central square!</p><p></p><p>"These must be the clan leaders and elders of the three major immortal clans! Quick, let's go occupy good positions at the central square!"</p><p></p><p>"My fellow Daoist, don't rush, I've already had someone reserve some spots for us there. Let's go together!"</p><p></p><p>"Good brother, lead the way!"</p><p></p><p>Here is the full English translation of the Chinese excerpt:</p><p></p><p>"Brother!" </p><p></p><p>"One mid-grade spirit stone, no bargaining."</p><p></p><p>"Scram! I'll just kill the one occupying it, then I won't have to pay anything! I thought you were being kind, but you're just a scalper. Ugh!"</p><p></p><p>"........"</p><p></p><p>In the restaurant.</p><p></p><p>"Master, the three immortal clans have arrived, the interrogation is about to begin."</p><p></p><p>The old turtle came and knocked on Lu Changsheng's door, respectfully reporting.</p><p></p><p>"Mm."</p><p></p><p>With a creak, the door opened. </p><p></p><p>Lu Changsheng stepped out and walked downstairs.</p><p></p><p>Seeing this, the old turtle chuckled smugly and followed behind with a swagger!</p><p></p><p>He loved to play the fool and take on the tiger - it was so thrilling.</p><p></p><p>........</p><p></p><p>In the central square of the City of Sand, it was very spacious. </p><p></p><p>It could easily accommodate tens of thousands of cultivators, but today, it seemed a bit insufficient...</p><p></p><p>Many cultivators couldn't squeeze in, so they could only watch from afar, either on the rooftops of some restaurants or suspended in the air.</p><p></p><p>As far as the eye could see, it was filled with people.</p><p></p><p>At this moment, the central square was quiet and still, with all the cultivators outwardly maintaining a solemn silence.</p><p></p><p>But underneath, the density of secret communications was likely overwhelming.</p><p></p><p>The three great immortal clans - Chu, Huang, and Chen - stood silently in the center, with Chu Lang, Huang Zhong, and Chen He in the lead, surrounded by the senior members of their clans, as well as some core disciples accompanied by their attendants. Chu Xirou and Zhang Youdao were also among them.</p><p></p><p>The next moment, five figures materialized in front of the three great immortal clans - four men and one woman. They wore uniform black and gold attire, standing upright with copper medallions hanging from their waists, engraved with three characters: "Patrol Hall!"</p><p></p><p>The square clearly became restless at this moment, but it was quickly suppressed.</p><p></p><p>Chu Lang and the others exchanged a glance, and the clan elders bowed and called out in unison, "Greetings, Patrol Hall envoys!"</p><p></p><p>The leading female Patrol Hall envoy narrowed her eyes slightly, a hint of danger flashing in them, before she spoke indifferently, "You may rise."</p><p></p><p>"Thank you, Patrol Hall envoy." </p><p></p><p>After the three great immortal clans rose, Zhao Ling continued, "I'm sure you know why you've been summoned here today."</p><p></p><p>With the Patrol Hall envoy directly broaching the main topic, the square fell even more silent, as everyone watched attentively, observing the unfolding events.</p><p></p><p>At this time, Lu Changsheng and the old turtle were quietly standing among the crowd, silently observing.</p><p></p><p>"Grandpa! You're here too, how coincidental!" </p><p></p><p>A voice suddenly echoed in the old turtle's mind.</p><p></p><p>The old turtle raised an eyebrow and turned his head, only to see the thin man he had met in the noodle shop three days ago... He had even said the boy was a talent back then.</p><p></p><p>"Good boy, you've really mastered the use of 'grandpa' to perfection."</p><p></p><p>The old turtle glanced at him, transmitting his thoughts.</p><p></p><p>The thin man chuckled awkwardly, then curiously looked at the young man in blue standing in front of the wealthy old hunchback. He could tell that this rich old man was clearly following the young man.</p><p></p><p>He had noticed that on the day they met in the noodle shop.</p><p></p><p>Just then, in the central area, Chu Lang stepped forward, his voice ringing out, "Patrol Hall envoy, twelve years ago, the Eternal Grand Sect was reduced to ruins. As the only sect in the Langzhou Domain, we three clans simply didn't have the ability to pose a threat to it, let alone its destruction happening in the blink of an eye. I hope the Patrol Hall envoy can see this clearly!"</p><p></p><p>Zhao Ling waved her hand indifferently, coldly stating, "There's no need to say anything else. I only have one question today: Besides you three immortal clans, who else in this Langzhou Domain could have posed a threat to the Eternal Grand Sect?"</p><p></p><p>Hearing this, Chu Lang's fist clenched in his sleeve. He was naturally hot-tempered, and knew today would be difficult to resolve amicably, so he simply grinned and said, "So the Patrol Hall envoy wants to frame us, is that it?"</p>

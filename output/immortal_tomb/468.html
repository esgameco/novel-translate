        <h1>Chapter 468</h1>
        <div class="content">
            <p>Here is the full English translation of the Chinese excerpt:</p><p></p><p>"It's really... Mr. [someone].</p><p></p><p>How coincidental, to encounter each other again in different worlds.</p><p></p><p>He Xitong really wants to see that familiar face in his memories, but it is difficult to see.</p><p></p><p>At this moment, countless gazes from the He Clan are fixed on that figure in blue robes, their eyes filled with shock, bitterness, and disbelief...</p><p></p><p>After all, even the ancient ancestors at the Divine Void Realm were suppressed without any ability to resist in this Refining Heaven Formation, yet this cultivator in blue robes seems unaffected by the Refining Heaven Formation, walking as if on level ground within this formation that suppresses everyone!</p><p></p><p>This person... what kind of extraordinary being is he!</p><p></p><p>From the top elder Ye Chueyue to the younger generation like Ye Feng, all the members of the Ye Clan are gaping in astonishment.</p><p></p><p>The man in the black robe looked at the approaching Lu Changsheng and coldly said, "You can just move around, do you really think you can withstand the Refining Heaven Formation? Lu Changsheng, you must know that I am different from anyone you have encountered before!"</p><p></p><p>As the words fell, the man in the black robe made a move with his mind.</p><p></p><p>Immediately, the Refining Heaven Formation hummed, and the dense blood qi condensed into countless evil spirits, lunging towards Lu Changsheng with bared fangs and claws!</p><p></p><p>"Then I'll play with you."</p><p></p><p>Lu Changsheng's expression remained calm, his eyes flashing as a zither floated in front of him. He extended his right hand and lightly plucked a string.</p><p></p><p>"Twang."</p><p></p><p>The light pluck produced a resounding note that echoed in everyone's ears like a thunderclap, momentarily blanking their minds.</p><p></p><p>As for the evil spirits condensed from the blood qi, they were all shattered before even reaching a few meters around Lu Changsheng!</p><p></p><p>The man in the black robe couldn't help but take a step back, staring at Lu Changsheng: "Lu Changsheng, you do have some tricks... but my Refining Heaven Formation has endless blood qi, and I can exhaust you to death!"</p><p></p><p>Hearing this, Lu Changsheng put away the zither, a hint of impatience flashing in his eyes, and then a blue light flickered in his pupils.</p><p></p><p>Boom!!</p><p></p><p>Before anyone could react, the entire Refining Heaven Formation simply collapsed!</p><p></p><p>With the collapse of the Refining Heaven Formation, the blood-red sky of the Void Ancient Realm immediately receded like a receding tide, and the color of the sky returned to normal.</p><p></p><p>And within the He Clan, the dense blood qi that had been in the Refining Heaven Formation seemed to be liberated, frantically dispersing and disappearing into the heavens and earth.</p><p></p><p>All the cultivators from the ancient clans were suddenly overjoyed to find that the overwhelming suppressive force had disappeared, and their movements had regained freedom. The blood qi in their bodies, which had been in turmoil and gradually decreasing, also stabilized at this moment.</p><p></p><p>"Lu Changsheng, what did you do?!"</p><p></p><p>The man in the black robe exclaimed in shock, as this scene had apparently startled him as well.</p><p></p><p>A well-established Refining Heaven Formation couldn't have collapsed for no reason, it must have been Lu Changsheng's doing!</p><p></p><p>But how exactly did Lu Changsheng accomplish this, the man in the black robe's gaze towards Lu Changsheng finally became grave.</p><p></p><p>The Refining Heaven Formation could be rebuilt, and the delay in refining the Myriad World Calamity Body was not a problem, but this Lu Changsheng, he must be eliminated today!</p><p></p><p>The man in the black robe's eyes flickered, and he suddenly made a hand seal and shouted, "Lu Changsheng, don't think that just because you killed a small world's Dao, no one can harm you! Today, I'll let you know that in this endless void, there are people above people, and heavens above heavens!"</p><p></p><p>What? Killed a Dao?!</p><p></p><p>Hearing the man in the black robe's words, Hong Wanjun and the others were horrified as they looked at Lu Changsheng!</p><p></p><p>Although they had not witnessed it themselves, the fact that it came from the powerful man in the black robe's mouth was undoubtedly true.</p><p></p><p>It's no wonder they were shocked beyond measure, as the phrase "killed a Dao" was something they had never heard before.</p><p></p><p>Here is the full English translation of the Chinese excerpt:</p><p></p><p>What's going on? Why did such a terrifying powerful expert appear, and not just one, but two?</p><p></p><p>The brothers Ye Zhuiyue and Ye Nantian, along with the others, suddenly looked at Ye Xiunwang. Ye Xiunwang could only respond with a bitter smile, as he truly knew nothing about this.</p><p></p><p>Ye Feng looked at the back of Lu Changsheng, continuously swallowing his saliva. No wonder Elder Lu had once said that as long as he was around, the sky would not fall - it turns out that Elder Lu himself was that ruthless person who had once destroyed the Heavenly Dao.</p><p></p><p>At the same time, Lu Changsheng just calmly looked at the man in the black robe, quietly waiting for his next performance.</p><p></p><p>In fact, Lu Changsheng hoped that this black-robed man could bring him a little bit of pressure...</p><p></p><p>At this moment, the crowd saw the black robe of the man start to move without any wind, and they frowned slightly, knowing that the black-robed man was about to unleash some technique. They slowly started to retreat.</p><p></p><p>However, what the black-robed man displayed was different in Lu Changsheng's eyes. Lu Changsheng could clearly see the surging laws circulating around the black-robed man...</p><p></p><p>Although they were both laws, in Lu Changsheng's perception, the black-robed man's laws had already taken shape, far beyond what Ouyang Mo and Hong Wanjun, the so-called divine emptiness, could compare to.</p><p></p><p>"Laws, these are laws! Such a dense laws, just what kind of existence is this black-robed man?!"</p><p></p><p>Soon, Hong Wanjun cried out in fright, as he could feel that his laws were like a drop of water compared to the vast ocean of the black-robed man's laws.</p><p></p><p>Ouyang Mo's expression was also one of shock and admiration. Although he had already known of the black-robed man's strength, when faced with such an overwhelming display of lawful power...</p><p></p><p>The expressions of the crowd were grim. Although most of them did not know what laws were, from the reactions of Hong Wanjun and Ouyang Mo, they could tell that laws were no ordinary thing, and that the black-robed man was about to unleash a powerful move.</p><p></p><p>Consequently, the crowd hastily retreated from the He Clan's territory, not daring to stay any longer, as the black-robed man's previous grand formation had already left a deep shadow in their hearts, and their inner qi had not yet fully stabilized.</p><p></p><p>"Light Laws!" </p><p></p><p>The black-robed man suddenly shouted in a stern voice.</p><p></p><p>In the next moment, the sky seemed to be pulled by the laws, erupting in dazzling brilliance!</p><p></p><p>This blinding light not only illuminated the Xuan Void Ancient Realm, but also lit up the vast expanse of the Qian Kun Heavens!!</p><p></p><p>Such a commotion attracted the attention of all living beings in the entire Qian Kun Heavens!</p><p></p><p>In the Cloud Mist Ancient Kingdom, the capital was in an uproar, with countless cultivators flying into the sky, watching the strange light in the sky with shock.</p><p></p><p>"Father King! Such a terrifying light seems to be projected from somewhere, and the coverage is extremely wide!" </p><p></p><p>In the royal palace, Cloud Ao's eyes were filled with doubt and worry as he said, "Father King, could it be that something has happened to Uncle Ye and the Azure Robe Elder?"</p><p></p><p>Cloud Ze looked up at the terrifying light, his face solemn and silent.</p><p></p><p>Such a terrifying light, it would be best if it was a celestial phenomenon.</p><p></p><p>If it was not a phenomenon, but rather man-made... then it would be truly horrifying.</p><p></p><p>...</p><p></p><p>The scene in the Xuan Void Ancient Realm was even more shocking, as the entire place was bathed in the terrifying light!</p><p></p><p>The He Clan, with Hong Wanjun, Ouyang Mo and the others, once again stood rigid, bathed in the light and unable to move.</p><p></p><p>Their pupils were trembling frantically, as such powerful laws had already exceeded their comprehension!</p><p></p><p>It seemed that any living being bathed in this light would have their life and death completely in the hands of the black-robed man!</p><p></p><p>...</p><p></p><p>For the fastest updates on flawless novels, please visit www.feixs.com</p><p></p><p>For mobile access: https://m.feixs.com/chapter-45751-38225587</p>

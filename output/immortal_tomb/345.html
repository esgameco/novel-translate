        <h1>Chapter 345</h1>
        <div class="content">
            <p>Here is the full English translation of the Chinese excerpt:</p><p></p><p>The Xianhe Restaurant was not particularly famous in the City of Man, as there were many restaurants and taverns scattered throughout the large city.</p><p></p><p>A young man in a black robe was walking leisurely down the wide street, occasionally glancing at the beautiful female cultivators passing by. </p><p></p><p>Who would have thought that this young man, who looked like a carefree aristocrat, was actually one of the Five Clan Lords of the Human Tribe - the Golden Wheel King?</p><p></p><p>"Daoist companion, may I ask where the Xianhe Restaurant is located?" </p><p></p><p>Han Jinlong politely asked a passing female cultivator, holding his folding fan.</p><p></p><p>The female cultivator was taken aback for a moment, but seeing that the young man was quite handsome, she teased, "Daoist companion, why go to a restaurant? Would you like to come to our Red Fragrance Pavilion instead?"</p><p></p><p>Red Fragrance Pavilion? </p><p></p><p>Han Jinlong was stunned, but quickly realized it was a brothel.</p><p></p><p>He didn't expect the female cultivator he randomly asked for directions to be involved in such a profession.</p><p></p><p>"Ahem, Daoist companion, I have important matters to attend to today and cannot indulge. Perhaps another day." Han Jinlong shook his head helplessly, making an excuse.</p><p></p><p>The female cultivator's expression immediately turned cold and she said impatiently, "I only know of the Red Fragrance Pavilion, I don't know anything about this 'Xianhe Restaurant'!"</p><p></p><p>With that, she glared at Han Jinlong and left.</p><p></p><p>Only Han Jinlong was left feeling flustered.</p><p></p><p>What was going on? It had been a while since he came down to the city, had the hearts of the human cultivators really become this cold?</p><p></p><p>"Hmph! Do you know who I am?!" </p><p></p><p>Han Jinlong spat in the direction the female cultivator left, then shook his fan and looked for his next target to ask for directions.</p><p></p><p>He decided not to ask any more women. Coincidentally, a thin young man passed by, and Han Jinlong quickly called out to him, "Daoist companion, please wait, do you know the way to the Xianhe Restaurant?"</p><p></p><p>The thin young man paused and turned to look at Han Jinlong. </p><p></p><p>It just so happened to be Zhou Dafu, the one who had been chatting with Lu Changsheng in the plaza that day.</p><p></p><p>Zhou Dafu sized up Han Jinlong and then smiled, "Daoist companion, you've asked the right person. When it comes to the geography of this City of Man, I, Zhou Dafu, have done quite a bit of research."</p><p></p><p>Han Jinlong's eyes brightened as he smiled, "Wonderful! If you tell me, I will certainly show my gratitude."</p><p></p><p>Zhou Dafu trembled, realizing he had encountered a 'fat sheep'. </p><p></p><p>After all, it was just giving directions, but this person was already promising great gratitude without hesitation.</p><p></p><p>"Daoist companion, how about I personally take you there? I've been to the Xianhe Restaurant to drink a couple times!" </p><p></p><p>Zhou Dafu said, patting his chest.</p><p></p><p>Han Jinlong pondered for a moment before nodding, "Good."</p><p></p><p>After that, Han Jinlong followed Zhou Dafu, turning left and right, weaving through the City of Man.</p><p></p><p>After some time, they finally arrived at the Xianhe Restaurant.</p><p></p><p>Han Jinlong looked at the Xianhe Restaurant in front of him, pausing for a moment, then lightly tapped his own head.</p><p></p><p>Going in circles, he had actually returned to the central area of the City of Man...</p><p></p><p>Ah, how could he have not realized it? The plaza where Miao Fan and Kong Zhen had battled was in this central region of the city!</p><p></p><p>If that azure-robed cultivator was able to appear there, then he most likely resided near the plaza.</p><p></p><p>"Uh, Daoist companion, is something wrong?" </p><p></p><p>Zhou Dafu looked at Han Jinlong suspiciously, not knowing what had happened that made him want to hit himself.</p><p></p><p>"Haha, no, thank you for bringing me here, a small token of my gratitude." </p><p></p><p>Han Jinlong was about to take out some spirit stones to give to Zhou Dafu, but was surprised to see Zhou Dafu staring blankly at the interior of the restaurant.</p><p></p><p>Han Jinlong's brow furrowed slightly, as he didn't want to waste any more time at the moment. He spoke in a low voice, "Daoist companion, do you not want the spirit stones?"</p><p></p><p>He had quite a handful of spirit stones on him.</p><p></p><p>"Shh!!"</p><p></p><p>Here is the full English translation of the Chinese excerpt:</p><p></p><p>"Ah!" </p><p></p><p>New 69 Book Bar â†’ 69shu.com</p><p></p><p>To everyone's surprise, Zhou Dafus' face suddenly turned deathly pale, and he gestured for Han Jinlong to be quiet.</p><p></p><p>Han Jinlong paused, sighed helplessly as he looked up, and noticed that the cultivators of the human race seemed indifferent, as if they had some mental issues.</p><p></p><p>As one of the five lords of the human race, he felt deeply pained by this.</p><p></p><p>"Dao... Dao companion, do you know who that person is?" </p><p></p><p>At this time, Zhou Dafus whispered to Han Jinlong.</p><p></p><p>Who?</p><p></p><p>Han Jinlong was puzzled for a moment, then followed Zhou Dafus' gaze and his eyes narrowed.</p><p></p><p>The one in green robes?</p><p></p><p>Thinking about Zhou Dafus' reaction, could it be that this person is...</p><p></p><p>"These days, the talk of the human city has been about the senior in green robes, and that's him!" Zhou Dafus took a deep breath and continued whispering.</p><p></p><p>Sure enough!</p><p></p><p>Han Jinlong's gaze sharpened, and then, to Zhou Dafus' astonishment, he walked straight into the Xianhe Tavern and directly towards the cultivator in green robes by the window.</p><p></p><p>Zhou Dafus was alarmed, anxious. Has this Daoist companion lost his mind?</p><p></p><p>He had just said that the other party was a senior in green robes, yet he still dared to go over there?</p><p></p><p>What was he trying to do?</p><p></p><p>Was he looking for death?</p><p></p><p>Zhou Dafus was so anxious that he was jumping up and down, feeling deeply ashamed, feeling that he had brought harm to this not-so-bright-minded Daoist cultivator.</p><p></p><p>However, remembering that he had previously spoken a few words with this senior in green robes, he should have some relationship with him?</p><p></p><p>So, taking a deep breath and mustering up his courage, he ran into the Xianhe Tavern, heading towards the window seat.</p><p></p><p>But Han Jinlong had already stood at the opposite side of the table, smiling as he held his fan: "Dao companion, may I have a seat?"</p><p></p><p>"Senior, senior, senior, he is my friend, his mind has always been a bit slow, I'm sorry, I didn't mean to offend!"</p><p></p><p>Zhou Dafus rushed over, bowing repeatedly in front of many curious customers, and then tried to pull the bewildered Han Jinlong out.</p><p></p><p>Han Jinlong snapped out of it, his face suddenly turning black!</p><p></p><p>Who the hell has a slow mind?</p><p></p><p>If he hadn't thought that this skinny guy was acting out of goodwill, he would have slapped him to death right then.</p><p></p><p>To dare call the mighty Golden Wheel King's mind slow and still live, this guy could boast about it for a lifetime.</p><p></p><p>At this point, Zhou Dafus was both anxious and feeling strange, huh, what's going on, why no matter how hard he tried, he couldn't pull this Daoist cultivator away?</p><p></p><p>Han Jinlong shook off Zhou Dafus' hand and calmly sat down in the seat.</p><p></p><p>Zhou Dafus' mind was now completely blank, but he also vaguely guessed... this young man in black robes was also a senior?</p><p></p><p>He felt that his life was so bitter, being toyed with by two seniors.</p><p></p><p>"You're here again, have a seat and have a drink."</p><p></p><p>At this time, Lu Changsheng, who had been watching the show, finally spoke up.</p><p></p><p>Zhou Dafus was now drenched in sweat, he dared not stay any longer, bowed and turned to leave, but found that his body had lost control, and he was stiffly seated at the table like a puppet being manipulated.</p><p></p><p>Seeing this, Han Jinlong's eyes flickered.</p><p></p><p>"Since I told you to sit down, then sit down. The human city is so big, that we could meet again is also fate, so please have a drink."</p><p></p><p>Lu Changsheng looked at Zhou Dafus and smiled faintly.</p><p></p><p>"Yes, yes, yes... Thank you, senior, for your hospitality. It is a great honor for Dafus to drink with the senior."  Zhou Dafus hurriedly said.</p><p></p><p>"Hehe." Lu Changsheng chuckled, then looked at Han Jinlong and said leisurely, "As for you..."</p><p></p><p>"Sitting down without my permission, is that appropriate?"</p>

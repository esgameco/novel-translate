        <h1>Chapter 422</h1>
        <div class="content">
            <p>Here is the full English translation of the Chinese excerpt:</p><p></p><p>"From now on, you will be the lord of this Tianxiang City."</p><p></p><p>Yun Aoye looked at the slightly more familiar Zhu Guyuan and casually ordered.</p><p></p><p>Who the lord of a small city is, it doesn't matter to Yun Aoye.</p><p></p><p>"Thank you, Prince Jiu!"</p><p></p><p>Zhu Guyuan was overjoyed in his heart. Guo Xiong's death was already a good thing, and now Prince Jiu has unexpectedly directly appointed him as the lord of Tianxiang City?</p><p></p><p>This is truly a joy upon joy.</p><p></p><p>With this position as the lord, he can cultivate the blue lotus seeds peacefully in this Tianxiang City in the future. When the blue lotus fruits mature, he, Zhu Guyuan, will be the next Shenwu Realm expert in the ancient Yunlan Kingdom!</p><p></p><p>Thinking of this, Zhu Guyuan glanced at Luo Qian, after all, the current Lord of the Luo Mansion is the only one who knows that he has the blue lotus seeds.</p><p></p><p>It seems that he needs to find a way to get rid of him.</p><p></p><p>As for Luo Qian, his expression was stiff. Prince Jiu had appointed the position of the lord so casually to Zhu Guyuan, which was something he had not expected.</p><p></p><p>Luo Qian thought of the blue lotus seeds, his gaze sharpened, and he couldn't help but look at Yun Aoye, his eyes filled with conflict and hesitation.</p><p></p><p>But when he thought of the person in the courtyard, he immediately gave up.</p><p></p><p>After all, Zhu Guyuan's daughter had previously helped the person in the courtyard without knowing the situation, almost costing the Zhu family everything.</p><p></p><p>So the pros and cons are already very complex and difficult to fathom.</p><p></p><p>That's right, why be stubborn about Prince Jiu? Why not just tell the lord in the courtyard about the blue lotus seeds directly?</p><p></p><p>Luo Qian believed that the blue lotus seeds, which could cultivate Shenwu Realm experts, would even make the lord in the courtyard feel tempted...</p><p></p><p>Thinking of this, Luo Qian sighed slightly, as for the blue lotus fruits, he didn't want them, but Zhu Guyuan couldn't easily obtain them either.</p><p></p><p>Luo Qian would rather use the blue lotus seeds to curry favor with the lord in the courtyard, perhaps he could get some benefits.</p><p></p><p>At this time, Yun Aoye and Ye Xunwang secretly discussed, then waved to Zhu Guyuan and said, "Disperse the crowd at Youting Lake."</p><p></p><p>As he spoke, Yun Aoye glanced at Zhu Qingqing, his gaze flickering.</p><p></p><p>This trip to Tianxiang City was originally for this woman, and this woman was indeed beautiful and gentle, deeply captivating him.</p><p></p><p>It's just that the plan has always been overtaken by changes.</p><p></p><p>If it weren't for the previous incident, Yun Aoye might have taken her to the capital.</p><p></p><p>But after what just happened, he didn't dare to.</p><p></p><p>Although Yun Aoye was clear that the lord in the courtyard was most likely not interested in this kind of woman, this Zhu Qingqing had ultimately acted correctly without knowing the situation.</p><p></p><p>Yun Aoye was naturally lustful, and it was well known among the people of the ancient Yunlan Kingdom.</p><p></p><p>If Zhu Qingqing were to show the slightest resistance, he feared it would provoke the destructive strike of the lord in the courtyard.</p><p></p><p>Not afraid of ten thousand, only afraid of the one.</p><p></p><p>Forget it, Yun Aoye has seen all kinds of women, this one is not lacking.</p><p></p><p>Yun Aoye can be lustful, but he absolutely cannot die at the hands of a woman!</p><p></p><p>Moreover, he had already communicated with Uncle Ye in secret just now, if he performs well, this blue-robed lord is the biggest harvest they can get in Tianxiang City!</p><p></p><p>As the Ninth Prince, Yun Aoye, who enjoys the favor of the King of the Yunlan Kingdom, is naturally not just a pure drunkard and glutton.</p><p></p><p>"Yes, yes, yes!" Zhu Guyuan hurriedly bowed and complied.</p><p></p><p>Soon, the figures at Youting Lake disappeared, and even Zhu Guyuan and Luo Qian left.</p><p></p><p>Only Yun Aoye and Ye Xunwang, the royal family members, were left standing, silent for a long time.</p><p></p><p>"Uncle Ye, how can we meet the lord......" Yun Aoye looked at the courtyard, transmitting his voice with some difficulty.</p><p></p><p>Yun Aoye could see at a glance that the lord was not easy to get along with.</p><p></p><p>"Cater to his preferences." Ye Xunwang said, and a scroll of sheet music appeared in his hand. He looked at the sheet music with a touch of sentiment and pain: "This scroll of sheet music has been in my possession since I obtained it, but I have never been able to play its essence. Today, I will present it to the lord."</p><p></p><p>Yun Aoye was stunned, and then looked at the sheet music with a surprised exclamation.</p><p></p><p>Here is my translation of the Chinese excerpt:</p><p></p><p>"Requiem!" </p><p></p><p>Ye Xunwang's requiem, of course Yunao Xie knew about it - this was Ye Xunwang's treasure!</p><p></p><p>Ye Xunwang wryly smiled, "This requiem score is extremely difficult to play. Although I've tried my best to perform it, it has never achieved the calming effect. Instead, those who hear it are heartbroken, I don't know where the problem lies."</p><p></p><p>"But your lordship's musical skills are beyond my reach. Perhaps your lordship can reveal the true essence of this requiem."</p><p></p><p>After saying this, Ye Xunwang slowly walked to the courtyard gate, bowing while holding the score, "Your lordship, Xunwang has a score called Requiem, I wonder if your lordship is interested?"</p><p></p><p>After a moment of silence, the courtyard gate opened, and the old turtle said faintly, "Come in."</p><p></p><p>Ye Xunwang and Yunao Xie were suddenly delighted!</p><p></p><p>"You four, stay outside!" </p><p></p><p>Yunao Xie instructed, then he and Ye Xunwang took a deep breath and bowed as they entered the courtyard.</p><p></p><p>...</p><p></p><p>As soon as the two entered the courtyard, they saw a man in blue robes sitting there, who was now looking at them. </p><p></p><p>Ye Xunwang became nervous, and quickly led the even more timid Yunao Xie to kneel in front of the man.</p><p></p><p>"Greetings, your lordship."</p><p></p><p>Lu Changsheng looked at the two and said softly, "Rise."</p><p></p><p>"Yes."</p><p></p><p>Ye Xunwang and Yunao Xie stood up awkwardly. Yunao Xie admitted that he had never been so awkward even in front of his father.</p><p></p><p>"Let me see it." Lu Changsheng extended his hand.</p><p></p><p>Ye Xunwang immediately understood, and quickly handed over the score.</p><p></p><p>Lu Changsheng took the score and opened it, reading it.</p><p></p><p>During this process, Ye Xunwang and Yunao Xie stood there, daring not to make a sound, not even daring to communicate secretly.</p><p></p><p>Lu Changsheng held the score in his left hand and slowly placed his right hand on the ancient zither on the table, then plucked the strings.</p><p></p><p>As the soothing zither sounds gradually arose, Ye Xunwang and Yunao Xie's eyes suddenly became blank and dazed.</p><p></p><p>The lingering zither sounds echoed in the courtyard. </p><p></p><p>Their souls seemed to have drifted into a profound and mysterious space, and the zither sounds were like a clear spring gently cleansing the filth from their souls, washing away the hazy dust.</p><p></p><p>Yunao Xie and Ye Xunwang's thoughts, perceptions, seemed to have merged with this special zither sound.</p><p></p><p>Gradually, gradually, they even had a sense of transcendence,</p><p></p><p>Their hearts stilled, their forms released, merging with the myriad transformations.</p><p></p><p>Even the old turtle's gaze became dazed at this moment.</p><p></p><p>Suddenly!</p><p></p><p>The soft zither sounds became rapid and even sharp. Like the roar of a primordial giant demon, it was awe-inspiring!!</p><p></p><p>Ye Xunwang and Yunao Xie's faces turned deathly pale, their expressions became horrifying and ghastly!</p><p></p><p>The feeling of cleansing the soul had completely disappeared, replaced by a sense of panic, a great terror!</p><p></p><p>Even the old turtle's expression slightly changed, and his body trembled slightly.</p><p></p><p>Just then, Lu Changsheng's right hand left the ancient zither, not continuing to play.</p><p></p><p>The zither sound stopped abruptly!</p><p></p><p>Ye Xunwang and Yunao Xie were like losing their support, collapsing to the ground like rotten mud.</p><p></p><p>The two were drenched in sweat, breathing heavily, their faces gradually turning from pale to red.</p><p></p><p>The previous feeling was so wonderful, why did it suddenly become so terrifying afterwards?</p><p></p><p>They vaguely felt that the sharp zither sound just now was just the beginning, if the man in blue robes continued to play,</p><p></p><p>Their fragile souls would be easily crushed.</p><p></p><p>This... this is not a requiem, is it?</p><p></p><p>Lu Changsheng closed the score and lightly chuckled, "This piece has a requiem prelude, but an exorcism interlude, and a soul-slaying finale."</p>

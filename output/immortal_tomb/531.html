        <h1>Chapter 531</h1>
        <div class="content">
            <p>Here is the full English translation of the Chinese excerpt:</p><p></p><p>"Ah, Executor...!"</p><p></p><p>This scene left over a dozen disciples of the Tianwu Sect completely dumbfounded.</p><p></p><p>What happened to the good Executor Song? </p><p></p><p>That young man in blue robes had merely stood there and said a few words, without even doing anything yet, but the Executor had already been frightened out of his wits?</p><p></p><p>Was this for real?</p><p></p><p>What exactly happened here!</p><p></p><p>The local residents were also dumbfounded, as they completely failed to understand how the situation had developed so differently from what they had expected.</p><p></p><p>Is this Mr. Lu really that formidable?</p><p></p><p>After the initial shock, Cao Yulong, Huang Yulang and the others' expressions turned bitter.</p><p></p><p>Mr. Lu turned out to be so powerful that he could simply stand there and intimidate the Executor of the Tianwu Sect.</p><p></p><p>At the same time, Huang Yulang glanced sideways at the dazed Huang Xuan in Zhang Shuhui's arms, and couldn't help but hesitate inwardly.</p><p></p><p>He was already somewhat unsure of himself, but once the words were spoken, they would be like spilled water - there would be no taking them back.</p><p></p><p>Ah, Shuhui's words were not wrong - even if Mr. Lu is so powerful, could Xuan really become a master of the Book Dao?</p><p></p><p>Instead of that, it would be better to cherish the opportunity at hand. Xuan is one of the rare few in the entire Xinglo Empire with the Earth Martial Vein - a mere hundred out of billions!</p><p></p><p>The Martial Dao, that is the path for Xuan to ascend!</p><p></p><p>Thinking this, Huang Yulang took a deep breath and stopped dwelling on it.</p><p></p><p>"My lord, then... Executor Song will take the children back to the sect first."</p><p></p><p>Executor Song swallowed hard. Although he was unwilling, he had no other choice.</p><p></p><p>Song also sensed that the person before him must be a powerful practitioner of the Book Dao.</p><p></p><p>But when did the Xinglo Empire produce such a powerful Book Dao expert? Song had met the higher-ups of the Northern Star Academy, and he was certain he had never seen this person before.</p><p></p><p>Ah, two Earth Martial Veins...</p><p></p><p>Never mind, the priority now is to save their own lives. He trusted his instincts!</p><p></p><p>Later, the sect's higher-ups can negotiate with this young man in blue.</p><p></p><p>The Earth Martial Vein children definitely cannot be simply given away. Those with the Earth Martial Vein are born for the Martial Dao - what use would the Book Dao be for them?...</p><p></p><p>Ah, this has become quite a mess.</p><p></p><p>Song was bitter in his heart, but he dared not say another word at the moment.</p><p></p><p>Lu Changsheng did not speak, only slowly closing his eyes, not even looking at Huang Xuan and the other eleven students.</p><p></p><p>Seeing this, Executor Song gave a slight bow, reluctantly glancing at Han Yue and Ye Xiaoxiao one last time, then resolutely turned and went to take Huang Xuan's hand, walking out.</p><p></p><p>The Tianwu Sect disciples also hurriedly followed, leading the other eleven students.</p><p></p><p>The children's parents were stunned for a moment, then anxiously, are they just going to take them away like this? They haven't even had a proper conversation yet...</p><p></p><p>"Today is not an opportune time. The parents of the selected children can come to the Tianwu Sect to visit another day," Executor Song said, and then led Huang Xuan away with the rest.</p><p></p><p>Huang Xuan kept turning his head back, his expression bitter as he looked at Lu Changsheng.</p><p></p><p>Being still young, he couldn't help but feel reluctant in his heart.</p><p></p><p>Recalling the scenes in the classroom over the past month, Huang Xuan had to admit that the teacher was a good one!</p><p></p><p>In just a short month, he had taught him many things, as well as lessons about how to conduct oneself.</p><p></p><p>If he didn't have the Martial Vein, Huang Xuan believed he would have continued staying at the Changsheng Academy, even if it was just an ordinary Martial Vein, he might have had the chance to remain at the Changsheng Academy.</p><p></p><p>But he has the Earth Martial Vein! </p><p></p><p>Out of the billions in the Xinglo Empire, there are less than a hundred with the Earth Martial Vein!</p><p></p><p>Huang Xuan couldn't understand, Xiao Fan may be just an ordinary Martial Vein, but Xiao Hei and Ye Xiaoxiao are also among the rare Earth Martial Veins - what are they doing this for?</p><p></p><p>Could it be that they really detest the Martial Dao that much?</p><p></p><p>In any case, Huang Xuan greatly admired them...</p><p></p><p>The other eleven students also occasionally looked back, their gazes towards Lu Changsheng varying.</p><p></p><p>Like Huang Xuan, they suddenly recalled one thing.</p><p></p><p>That was, the teacher had not yet taken them to see the different worlds, as he had originally said he would do after they had memorized the Three-Character Classic and he had visited their homes.</p><p></p><p>But now, that had become a mere illusion.</p><p></p><p>"Listen well, I do not interfere with your choices, but from now on, do not address me as 'teacher' if we happen to meet again."</p><p></p><p>At this moment, Lu Changsheng's calm voice rang out.</p><p></p><p>Huang Xuan and the others stiffened, quickly, under countless gazes,</p><p></p><p>Here is the full English translation of the Chinese excerpt:</p><p></p><p>Disappeared without a trace.</p><p></p><p>Lu Changsheng opened his eyes and glanced at the distance, his gaze unwavering.</p><p></p><p>Martial Veins?</p><p></p><p>It was just a technique he used to forcibly cultivate them in the bodies of fifteen students.</p><p></p><p>If he had not been in this Jixiang Town, there would not have been a single Martial Vein in this Jixiang Town!</p><p></p><p>When Lu Changsheng first recruited students, he truly just looked at their affinity, without any other criteria.</p><p></p><p>Han Yue, Huang Xuan, and Ye Xiaoxiao were the three he was most optimistic about among the fifteen students, so he specially bestowed the Martial Vein test upon them.</p><p></p><p>As for the result, it was what it is today.</p><p></p><p>Only three students remained, and Han Yue, Ye Xiaoxiao, and Xiao Fan would be the true students of his Changsheng Academy going forward.</p><p></p><p>As for the matter of the Martial Veins, as long as Lu Changsheng did not speak of it, then the many parents and students like Huang Xuan would never know about it.</p><p></p><p>Little did they know that even if they could join the Tianwu Sect, it was a blessing Lu Changsheng had casually bestowed upon them!</p><p></p><p>Lu Changsheng was also too lazy to take back the Martial Veins, let them be.</p><p></p><p>Although it was just a month, it was still a teacher-student relationship. He hoped that in the future, Huang Xuan and the others would do well, not stray from the path of growth, and not be ungrateful and provoke him or his students.</p><p></p><p>Otherwise, Lu Changsheng would personally take back the Martial Veins!</p><p></p><p>Huang Xuan and the others' choice was reasonable enough.</p><p></p><p>But if something were to happen later, Lu Changsheng taking back the Martial Veins would also be perfectly reasonable.</p><p></p><p>...</p><p></p><p>After testing for half a day, it was already noon, which was also quite fast.</p><p></p><p>"Han Yue, Xiaoxiao, Xiao Fan, class starts tomorrow, don't be late."</p><p></p><p>Lu Changsheng smiled slightly and then carried the big fish towards the town.</p><p></p><p>The townspeople quickly made way for him.</p><p></p><p>"Yes, Master!" The three of them quickly responded.</p><p></p><p>Lu Changsheng suddenly paused in his steps, turned around, and quickly located Old Xu in the crowd, waving the big fish in his hand and smiling, "Old Xu, it's time for lunch, I want to eat noodles, and can you prepare this fish separately for me?"</p><p></p><p>"Ah, ah, sure, Mr. Lu!" Old Xu was startled, then quickly ran off.</p><p></p><p>As for what kind of noodles to make, he didn't even ask, it would undoubtedly be scallion noodles.</p><p></p><p>Soon, Old Xu took the big fish from Lu Changsheng's hand, and then they chatted and laughed as they walked into the town, disappearing from the crowd's sight.</p><p></p><p>"Cough, cough, the testing is also over, it's time for a meal, everyone go back and start a fire to cook, don't let the children go hungry!"</p><p></p><p>Cao Yulong coughed loudly and spoke in a loud voice.</p><p></p><p>The townspeople all responded in agreement and dispersed, Han Tie and Wu Cuilan also led Han Yue back towards the small village ten li away.</p><p></p><p>"Han Yue!"</p><p></p><p>At this moment, Cao Yulong suddenly called out to the Han family.</p><p></p><p>Han Yue was startled, and he and his parents quickly turned around and hurried to Cao Yulong, bowing before him in the gaze of Huang Yulang and the others who had not yet left.</p><p></p><p>Cao Yulong stepped forward and helped the three of them up, smiling, "Han Yue, coming from the village ten li away to town for class every day, the time must be quite rushed, right?"</p><p></p><p>Han Yue was stunned, he looked at his parents, wanting to speak but hesitating.</p><p></p><p>In front of the Town Master, he dared not say too much, afraid of saying the wrong thing.</p><p></p><p>Han Tie and Wu Cuilian were also anxious at the moment.</p><p></p><p>Before they could carefully respond, Cao Yulong smiled and said, "How about the Town Master gives you a house? Don't worry, it's an old property I bought years ago, just sitting empty. I'll give it to your family to live in, so that in the future, Han Yue won't have to rush so much to go to Mr. Lu's place for class."</p><p></p><p>Ah?</p><p></p><p>The Han family was dumbfounded.</p><p></p><p>Ye Xiaoxiao and Xiao Fan were also startled, but quickly delighted, happy for Han Yue.</p><p></p><p>However, Huang Yulang and the other clan elders, as well as Ye Xiaoxiao's parents, had flickering gazes, not surprised at all.</p><p></p><p>Now that Han Yue's identity was extraordinary, not only was he a mysterious Mr. Lu's student, but he also had the Earth Martial Vein within him.</p><p></p><p>So the Town Master's gesture was not strange at all.</p><p></p><p>It was also considered extending an olive branch, establishing a relationship in advance, after all, they were all shrewd people.</p><p></p><p>Why didn't they see this coming before today?</p><p></p><p>So for people, in addition to having a background, it is more important to have one's own value.</p><p></p><p>The saying "the iron is not hard enough" is exactly this principle.</p>

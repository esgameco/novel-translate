        <h1>Chapter 433</h1>
        <div class="content">
            <p>Here is the full English translation of the Chinese excerpt:</p><p></p><p>Cloud Ao Xie exited the sleeping palace of Cloud Ze Cang and headed towards the Weiyang Pavilion.</p><p></p><p>Soon, Cloud Ao Xie arrived outside the Weiyang Pavilion.</p><p></p><p>"Greetings, Ninth Prince." </p><p></p><p>The palace maids outside quickly paid their respects.</p><p></p><p>Cloud Ao Xie waved his hand and said, "Go tell Ke Ning that this prince has come to visit."</p><p></p><p>"Yes, the Ninth Prince, please wait a moment."</p><p></p><p>The leading maid curtsied and went inside the pavilion, soon coming back out respectfully, "Ninth Prince, the Princess requests your presence."</p><p></p><p>Cloud Ao Xie nodded and stepped in quickly.</p><p></p><p>Afterwards, Cloud Ao Xie came to the back garden in a familiar manner, and saw a young lady feeding fish in the pavilion.</p><p></p><p>Cloud Ao Xie pursed his lips and walked over, calling out with a smile, "Ke Ning."</p><p></p><p>Ke Ning put down the feed in her hand. "Elder brother."</p><p></p><p>Cloud Ao Xie nodded and sat down beside her, smiling, "Aren't you bored staying in this Weiyang Pavilion every day? How about coming with this prince to stroll the streets?"</p><p></p><p>Ke Ning sat down across from Cloud Ao Xie and shook her head, "No need, thank you for the kind offer, elder brother."</p><p></p><p>"You..." Cloud Ao Xie sighed helplessly, but soon suppressed his smile. "Ke Ning, I've troubled you this time."</p><p></p><p>As he said this, Cloud Ao Xie looked at Ke Ning, but could not see any emotion on her face.</p><p></p><p>"Elder brother, do you know about the esteemed person from the Observation Pavilion?" Ke Ning suddenly asked.</p><p></p><p>Huh? The Observation Pavilion?</p><p></p><p>Cloud Ao Xie was taken aback, but immediately knew who Ke Ning was referring to.</p><p></p><p>He then blurted out, "How do you know of that esteemed person's existence?"</p><p></p><p>Logically speaking, Ke Ning has been secluded in this Weiyang Pavilion, indifferent to everything, so her information should have been cut off, right?</p><p></p><p>"A few days ago, that esteemed person played the zither..." </p><p></p><p>Ke Ning then briefly recounted the events, omitting the part about her going to the Observation Terrace.</p><p></p><p>Hearing this, Cloud Ao Xie suddenly understood.</p><p></p><p>A few days ago, he had just gone to Wanhua Garden with Senior Turtle, coincidentally missing it.</p><p></p><p>"I see, Ke Ning, that esteemed person is indeed a formidable existence. Ah, not to mention that esteemed person, even their servant Senior Turtle is an astounding existence. Uncle Ye's strength, I'm sure you're aware of it too, he can even withstand one move from Senior Turtle."</p><p></p><p>Cloud Ao Xie wasted no time in explaining the terrifying nature of Lu Changsheng.</p><p></p><p>After he finished, Cloud Ao Xie expected Ke Ning to be shocked, but found that her expression only showed some surprise, nothing more.</p><p></p><p>"Ke Ning, aren't you shocked?" Cloud Ao Xie couldn't help but ask.</p><p></p><p>"Elder brother, of course Ke Ning is shocked." Ke Ning hesitated for a moment before continuing, "It's just that Ke Ning has personally witnessed that esteemed person's abilities, so I've become a bit accustomed to it."</p><p></p><p>Ah? Personally witnessed?</p><p></p><p>Cloud Ao Xie was dumbfounded!</p><p></p><p>To be honest, apart from witnessing the青衣大人's (the esteemed person in blue)'s zither skills at Youying Lake that day, he didn't know anything else.</p><p></p><p>He only knew that Uncle Ye was extremely powerful based on what he had heard.</p><p></p><p>"Tell me the details."</p><p></p><p>Seeing that Cloud Ao Xie was all ears, Ke Ning briefly recounted the events of that day.</p><p></p><p>"Sss! The shattered door was reconstructed and looked exactly the same as before?"</p><p></p><p>Soon, Cloud Ao Xie sucked in a cold breath, his eyes filled with shock!</p><p></p><p>Today, he finally learned of the true strength of the esteemed person in blue, even though it was from Ke Ning's account, but he believed that Ke Ning would not speak of mere jokes.</p><p></p><p>"Mm-hmm, elder brother, you haven't told me where that esteemed person came from yet," Ke Ning asked curiously.</p><p></p><p>Cloud Ao Xie regained his composure and started from the beginning in Tianxiang City, ending with a shrug:</p><p></p><p>"That's all your elder brother knows. This is the first time I've had the honor of seeing..."</p><p></p><p>Here is the full English translation of the Chinese excerpt:</p><p></p><p>"Sir, it was in that Xianghong City."</p><p></p><p>Kening nodded and lowered her eyes, no longer speaking.</p><p></p><p>Yunao Xie saw this and also did not speak further, recalling the matter of Fengluan and sighing lightly in his heart, then sitting there quietly keeping him company.</p><p></p><p>.........</p><p></p><p>Half a month later.</p><p></p><p>The Palace Audience Hall.</p><p></p><p>In addition to the officials, there were three other strangers.</p><p></p><p>At this moment, the Prime Minister was chatting and laughing with the young man leading the three.</p><p></p><p>"Hehe, Princess Kening is the most beloved princess of our King. The Crown Prince must cherish her well in the future."  The Prime Minister, Zhang Dao, smiled.</p><p></p><p>Feng Changxuan's eyes flashed with pride as he gracefully smiled, "Please rest assured, Prime Minister. As for Princess Kening, this Prince will cherish her a hundredfold."</p><p></p><p>"Since the Crown Prince says so, I can rest easy then," Zhang Dao pretended to sigh.</p><p></p><p>Indeed, the young man before them was the Crown Prince of the ancient Fengluan Kingdom, Feng Changxuan, and the two middle-aged men in armor behind him were Fengluan's generals, accompanying Feng Changxuan.</p><p></p><p>"The King has arrived!"</p><p></p><p>At this moment, a high-pitched voice sounded from outside the hall.</p><p></p><p>Immediately, a gust of wind swept through the great hall, and the next moment, the figure of Yunzao Qing stood atop the hall!</p><p></p><p>"Greet the King!"</p><p></p><p>The officials quickly knelt down to pay respects.</p><p></p><p>Feng Changxuan's eyes flickered, and he and the two generals bowed, "Greetings to King Yunlan."</p><p></p><p>Huh?</p><p></p><p>Yunzao Qing saw that Feng Changxuan did not perform the kneeling salute, and even the two generals behind him did not do so either, and he couldn't help but feel angry!</p><p></p><p>This simple act already fully showed that they did not take his ancient Yunlan Kingdom seriously at all.</p><p></p><p>When Feng Changxuan last met him, he was not as arrogant as he is today...</p><p></p><p>Although Yunzao Qing was angry in his heart, he did not show it on his face, and immediately sat down, waving his sleeve indifferently, "You may all rise."</p><p></p><p>"Thank you, Your Majesty!"</p><p></p><p>The officials stood up from the ground, and Feng Changxuan and the others also slowly straightened up.</p><p></p><p>Yunzao Qing looked down at Feng Changxuan and pretended to tease, "Crown Prince, you are in such a hurry. Wouldn't it be better to wait quietly in the ancient Fengluan Kingdom for Kening to come?"</p><p></p><p>Feng Changxuan smiled and said respectfully, "Your Majesty, thinking that I will soon be able to marry Kening, I couldn't bear it in my heart and couldn't help but discuss with my father to come to Yunlan in person to pick up Kening."</p><p></p><p>Hearing this, Yunzao Qing sighed lightly, forcing a smile and said, "Since you've come, there's no need to be in a hurry. Have the evening banquet tonight, and leave tomorrow."</p><p></p><p>"Yes!" Feng Changxuan was naturally happy, and couldn't help but ask expectantly, "Your Majesty, will Kening attend the evening banquet?"</p><p></p><p>Yunzao Qing nodded slightly.</p><p></p><p>Seeing this, Feng Changxuan smiled in satisfaction, his heart burning with excitement.</p><p></p><p>.........</p><p></p><p>As night fell, the palace was brightly lit.</p><p></p><p>Outside the Observation Pavilion, Ye Xunwang suddenly appeared.</p><p></p><p>"Who dares to trespass the Observation Pavilion!!" The guards were startled by this sight, but seeing it was Ye Xunwang, they quickly saluted, "Greetings, Lord Ye!"</p><p></p><p>After the previous incident, they didn't dare call him the Sage of the Qin anymore, as stripping the skin and breaking the bones was not just empty talk.</p><p></p><p>Hearing this title, Ye Xunwang was slightly satisfied and smiled, "Correct."</p><p></p><p>The guards' faces flushed red with the praise.</p><p></p><p>Ye Xunwang did not say more, took a deep breath and entered the Observation Pavilion.</p><p></p><p>Ye Xunwang came here to invite Lu Changsheng and the Old Turtle to attend the evening banquet.</p><p></p><p>.........</p><p></p><p>For the fastest updates of this flawless novel, please visit www.feixs.com</p><p></p><p>For mobile access, please go to: https://m.feixs.com/chapter-45751-38225552</p>

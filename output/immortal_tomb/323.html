            <p>Here is the full English translation of the Chinese excerpt:</p><p></p><p>Lu Changsheng chuckled and did not want to say more on this topic. He then said, "Well, there's no need for you to persuade me, it's useless."</p><p></p><p>Mang Tian and Jiang Wuxin suddenly fell silent. While they were worried, they also felt a sense of relief. </p><p></p><p>Truly, he is the peerless genius of the human race, possessing great love and willing to sacrifice himself for his clan.</p><p></p><p>Involuntarily, their eyes were filled with admiration as they looked at Lu Changsheng.</p><p></p><p>Lu Changsheng raised his brows slightly, knowing that these two had misunderstood.</p><p></p><p>To be honest, he found it quite novel that people were always looking at him with the eyes of an elder looking at a junior.</p><p></p><p>That Jian Wuhui was like this, and these Mang Tian and Jiang Wuxin were also like this.</p><p></p><p>Lu Changsheng didn't even know how long he had lived, so how dare these people look at him with the eyes of a junior?</p><p></p><p>Of course, Lu Changsheng couldn't be bothered to dwell on it.</p><p></p><p>Lu Changsheng glanced at the two Heavenly Dao Lords, then turned and disappeared.</p><p></p><p>Mang Tian and Jiang Wuxin were stunned.</p><p></p><p>"Hehe, this young friend Lu is not bad, just a bit impolite," Mang Tian said regretfully.</p><p></p><p>"Indeed, we are at least the older generation," Jiang Wuxin agreed with a nod.</p><p></p><p>The two fell silent for a moment, then cupped their hands towards the two Heavenly Dao Lords: "We shall take our leave."</p><p></p><p>The two Heavenly Dao Lords returned the gesture: "Farewell."</p><p></p><p>In the next moment, the two Heavenly Dao Lords retreated into the void, and the spiritual awareness of Mang Tian and Jiang Wuxin dissipated into particles in the heavens and earth.</p><p></p><p>...</p><p></p><p>At the same time, </p><p></p><p>Lu Changsheng summoned the Heavenly Dao of the Eternal Realm and had it point out the locations of the seven clans.</p><p></p><p>Soon, he released the six-path sword qi to strike the six clans tens of millions of miles away.</p><p></p><p>In an instant, the Eternal Realm echoed with the cries of swords from all directions!</p><p></p><p>After completely exterminating the remaining clan elders and disciples of the six clans,</p><p></p><p>he finally came to the only surviving Ancient Moon Blood Clan.</p><p></p><p>At this moment, the Ancient Moon Blood Clan was in complete chaos!</p><p></p><p>Because in the sky of their small world, there stood a young man in blue robes, </p><p>instilling endless awe and terror in them.</p><p></p><p>Through the words of the Holy Maiden, all the members of the Blood Clan knew that this was the ruthless person who had destroyed sixty-eight Deity Realm experts of the seven clans and their ancestors.</p><p></p><p>Among the Blood Clan, the blood demoness Yue, dressed in a red robe, trembled as she looked at the young man in the sky.</p><p></p><p>Lu Changsheng looked down at her from above, but after a brief glance, he turned his gaze away, his expression indifferent.</p><p></p><p>Yue had ultimately only been controlled by him before. The previously obedient Sword Rock from the Ancient Wasteland Sword Clan and his two disciples had also died, right?</p><p></p><p>They were not like the brother and sister Leiyu and Leiting from the Great Sun Thunder Sect that he had encountered in Linglang Heaven, </p><p>whom he ultimately couldn't bring himself to kill.</p><p></p><p>Although he killed indiscriminately, he did so according to his own principles. That brother and sister were an exception, a remnant of the compassion in his heart.</p><p></p><p>However, later when he opened a medical clinic, saved lives, taught Little Tong medicine, and spread it for generations, he could be considered a good person.</p><p></p><p>Thinking of this, a faint smile appeared on Lu Changsheng's lips. A wisp of sword qi circled around his fingertips, and then he lightly flicked it out.</p><p></p><p>After releasing it, he turned and disappeared, no longer looking at the Ancient Moon Blood Clan.</p><p></p><p>Under this faint sword qi, the small world of the Ancient Moon Blood Clan collapsed, heaven and earth shattering!</p><p></p><p>The endless sword qi reaped the lives of all the clan members like the Grim Reaper, and no one could resist it!</p><p></p><p>The last sound that echoed in this sky was the heart-wrenching scream of the blood demoness Yue:</p><p></p><p>"Senior!"</p><p></p><p>...</p><p></p><p>On the edge of the Moon Star Domain,</p><p></p><p>Li Shuyan still stood silently, occasionally touching his bald head, waiting for Lu Changsheng.</p><p></p><p>He knew that the master's affairs should be almost done.</p><p></p><p>He had only one thought in his heart: the master is too strong, endlessly strong!</p><p></p><p>Deciding to follow the master was the right choice, far better than being a monk in the Ancestral Heaven Realm, isn't it?</p><p></p><p>Here is the full English translation of the Chinese novel excerpt:</p><p></p><p>"Let's go."</p><p></p><p>At this moment, Lu Changsheng appeared in front of the dazed Li Shuyan.</p><p></p><p>"Sir!" Li Shuyan hurriedly greeted him.</p><p></p><p>"Mm." Lu Changsheng nodded slightly and turned to leave.</p><p></p><p>"Sir, where are we going next?"</p><p></p><p>"The matters here have been dealt with. Let's just wander around and take a look at the scenery, then prepare to leave the Yongzhou Realm."</p><p></p><p>"Understood."</p><p></p><p>"After the tour, we'll go to Jingyu City."</p><p></p><p>"Sir, why go there again?"</p><p></p><p>"Where it starts is where it ends."</p><p></p><p>"I see... Sir..."</p><p></p><p>"Speak less. If you keep running your mouth, you can report to Hunhui."</p><p></p><p>"..."</p><p></p><p>...</p><p></p><p>Months later.</p><p></p><p>In Jingyu City, within the Fu Clan.</p><p></p><p>Liu Tu and Liu Qing, along with their clan elders, were visiting the Fu Clan. The relationship between the two clans was now extremely close, almost to the point of merging.</p><p></p><p>"Ah, it's been several months since the Sword Chant. It seems the Ancient Clan has truly disappeared from the Yongzhou Realm. Thinking about it now, it really was like a dream. I suppose Senior Lu has already left the Yongzhou Realm."</p><p></p><p>In the main hall, Liu Tu sighed as he sipped his tea.</p><p></p><p>The elders all silently nodded, still feeling bewildered.</p><p></p><p>Fu Liancai chuckled, "Elder Liu Tu, can you imagine if our senior had appeared in our Jingyu City and resided in our Fu Clan? Our ancestors must have been overjoyed."</p><p></p><p>Hearing this, Liu Tu, Liu Qing, and the Liu Clan elders looked at the Fu Clan members with envy.</p><p></p><p>Although it's true that Senior Lu had rewarded their two clans with 1,500 spots in the Heavenly Prodigy Assembly, they still felt a sense of imbalance knowing that Senior Lu had resided in the Fu Clan.</p><p></p><p>Even though Senior Lu had not bestowed any treasures upon the Fu Clan, they could imagine that the place where such a powerful expert had lived must be extraordinary.</p><p></p><p>Who knows, it might even have some auspicious energy that could bless the Fu Clan for thousands of years.</p><p></p><p>Liu Tu shook his head, dispelling the wild thoughts in his mind, and suddenly sighed with a smile, "I find myself envying that old fellow Ouyang Zui."</p><p></p><p>The others were taken aback, not understanding why Liu Tu would envy Ouyang Zui, who had been killed by Senior Lu.</p><p></p><p>"Haha, you are all still young." Seeing their expressions, Liu Tu knew what they were thinking and explained, "Think about it, Ouyang Zui was only at the mid-Shengyang Realm, a mere ant to Senior Lu. Yet he was able to die by Senior Lu's sword. Truly a once-in-a-lifetime opportunity."</p><p></p><p>"Oh, would you like me to grant you that 'once-in-a-lifetime opportunity' as well?"</p><p></p><p>Suddenly, a figure in blue robes appeared like a ghost in the hall, looking at Liu Tu with a meaningful smile.</p><p></p><p>"Pff!!!"</p><p></p><p>The tea in the mouths of the crowd sprayed out in an instant.</p><p></p><p>"Senior, Senior, Senior, Senior, Senior!"</p><p></p><p>The next moment, Liu Tu and the others quickly knelt down, their heads touching the ground, their hearts pounding.</p><p></p><p>Lu Changsheng walked to the main seat and sat down, saying leisurely, "You may all rise."</p><p></p><p>They dared not refuse, supporting each other as they shakily stood up, but all kept their heads lowered, not daring to look at the man on the main seat.</p><p></p><p>Lu Changsheng calmly poured himself a cup of tea.</p><p></p><p>The crowd trembled, terrified!</p><p></p><p>Damn it, they were so afraid that they had neglected to notice, and now the senior had to pour the tea himself!</p><p></p><p>Lu Changsheng took a sip of the tea and smiled, "Please, continue your conversation. Weren't you all chatting so happily just now? Let me see, you were talking about how it's a once-in-a-lifetime opportunity to die by my sword. Well, who wants that 'once-in-a-lifetime opportunity'? I'd be more than happy to oblige."</p><p></p><p>Liu Tu's face turned deathly pale, and he immediately knelt down with a loud thud.</p><p></p><p>"Senior, please spare me! I... I was just..."</p>

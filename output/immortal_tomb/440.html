        <h1>Chapter 440</h1>
        <div class="content">
            <p>Here is the full English translation of the excerpt from the Chinese novel:</p><p></p><p>Lu Changsheng looked at Zhu Xingqiu for a while and said indifferently, "Today I will not punish you, you can go to Peng Fang's place to receive your punishment later."</p><p></p><p>Zhu Xingqiu was immediately pardoned, and he kowtowed repeatedly, "Yes!"</p><p></p><p>At this moment, all was silent, and the people of the ancient country of Fenglan shivered, wanting to flee, but their feet felt as if they were filled with lead.</p><p></p><p>Lu Changsheng did not say anything more, he closed his eyes, nodded slightly, and then slowly dissipated.</p><p></p><p>When the people saw the illusory figure of the azure light disappear, their spirits relaxed, but no one dared to speak.</p><p></p><p>After a moment, Zhu Xingqiu tremblingly stood up, and the people saw his face, which was deathly pale and bloodless!</p><p></p><p>It seems that this Spiritual Realm expert was truly terrified to the bone of that azure-robed young man, and the people grew increasingly in awe of Lu Changsheng.</p><p></p><p>Ye Xunwang and Yun Aoye looked at each other and sighed bitterly, feeling greatly relieved in their hearts.</p><p></p><p>They never expected that inviting the azure-robed gentleman to the capital city would inadvertently save the entire Yunlan...</p><p></p><p>If it weren't for the azure-robed gentleman, Yunlan would have been doomed.</p><p></p><p>Yun Aoye suddenly remembered the current lord of Tianxiang City, Zhu Guyuan. It's a good thing he had introduced his daughter earlier, otherwise he would never have gone to Tianxiang City, let alone have the opportunity to invite the gentleman to the capital.</p><p></p><p>"Lord of Yunlan, this, this is a misunderstanding, we, we will withdraw from the ancient country of Yunlan."</p><p></p><p>The Lord of Fenglan saw that the situation was hopeless and wanted to withdraw.</p><p></p><p>Seeing this, the eyes of Yun Zeqing and Ye Xunwang narrowed. The Lord of Fenglan wanted to withdraw just because things didn't go his way? </p><p></p><p>How could Yunlan be a place that Fenglan could just come and go as they pleased?</p><p></p><p>"Lord of Fenglan, do you think Yunlan is a place that you can invade at will and withdraw at will? What do you take our ancient country of Yunlan for?"</p><p></p><p>Yun Zeqing finally couldn't hold back and said in a gloomy tone.</p><p></p><p>"Lord of Yunlan, you jest... It really was a misunderstanding."</p><p></p><p>The Lord of Fenglan gave a bitter smile, but he no longer dared to be as arrogant as before. He looked at Zhu Xingqiu, who was still standing there, still shaken by the previous fright and had not yet recovered.</p><p></p><p>The Lord of Fenglan was a little anxious at this moment, wanting Zhu Xingqiu to help him.</p><p></p><p>Just then, Zhu Xingqiu regained his senses and said in a gloomy tone, "Lord of Yunlan, how about I help you eliminate these invaders?"</p><p></p><p>Ah?</p><p></p><p>The Lord of Fenglan was shocked and exclaimed, "Sir Zhu, what are you..."</p><p></p><p>The officials and troops of Fenglan also paused for a moment, their expressions becoming terrified.</p><p></p><p>Ah? Sir Zhu wants to help Yunlan against them?</p><p></p><p>Associating with the previous azure-robed young man, Sir Zhu's actions seemed to make sense.</p><p></p><p>Yun Zeqing hurriedly bowed and said, "Sir Zhu, this matter is best left to us Yunlan to handle!"</p><p></p><p>In Yun Zeqing's view, Fenglan's military morale was now clearly in disarray and had little fighting power left.</p><p></p><p>Yun Zeqing was confident in defeating them!</p><p></p><p>As for this Spiritual Realm expert, he was the subordinate of the azure-robed gentleman, it's better not to bother him.</p><p></p><p>The azure-robed gentleman had already dealt with the greatest crisis, as for the rest, it was Yunlan's own business.</p><p></p><p>Zhu Xingqiu paused, not expecting to be rejected?</p><p></p><p>But he didn't say much, glanced at the Observation Pavilion in the palace, and flashed towards that direction.</p><p></p><p>The Lord of Fenglan felt a little relieved, but his mood was still very heavy, because he knew that if nothing unexpected happened today, the Fenglan army would be completely wiped out.</p><p></p><p>Including himself, the Lord of Fenglan, he was very likely to die as well.</p><p></p><p>There was no way to resist, with that azure-robed young man in the capital of Yunlan, the morale of Fenglan's army had been completely shattered.</p><p></p><p>It could even be said to have no fighting spirit at all.</p><p></p><p>"Kill!!"</p><p></p><p>At this moment, Yun Zeqing let out a fierce shout, and the high-spirited troops of Yunlan suddenly surged forward!</p><p></p><p>The Lord of Fenglan's pupils shrank, and he gritted his teeth and shouted.</p><p></p><p>Here is the full English translation of the Chinese excerpt:</p><p></p><p>"Wind Roc soldiers, hear my order! Follow your king and fight! Fight to uphold the honor of our ancient Wind Roc nation!!"</p><p></p><p>"Kill!"</p><p></p><p>The Wind Roc army paused for a moment, reluctantly mustering their spirits to go meet this almost impossible battle.</p><p></p><p>Boom!</p><p></p><p>Soon, outside the capital, a huge commotion erupted again, with the sky shaking and the earth trembling under the massive, terrifying magical arts.</p><p></p><p>At the rear of the Wind Roc army, the Wind Roc monarch saw that the battle was indeed one-sided, and his gaze began to struggle.</p><p></p><p>At this rate, his Wind Roc army would be defeated without a doubt!</p><p></p><p>The Wind Roc monarch's footsteps suddenly began to slowly retreat, then he abruptly turned and tried to flee!!</p><p></p><p>Watching him closely, Yunze Cang not only did not grow anxious, but instead rejoiced, coldly shouting:</p><p></p><p>"Your king has abandoned you and fled, so why should you sacrifice your lives for Wind Roc?"</p><p></p><p>Yunze Cang's words rang like thunderclaps in the ears of every Wind Roc soldier.</p><p></p><p>The Wind Roc soldiers were stunned, then quickly looked over and indeed saw the fleeing back of the Wind Roc monarch!</p><p></p><p>Suddenly, they felt the world spinning, and their remaining fighting spirit was completely crushed!</p><p></p><p>The Yunlang army seized the opportunity, immediately attacking with full force!</p><p></p><p>In an instant, the Wind Roc army was being frantically slaughtered, with severed limbs and shattered remains strewn everywhere!</p><p></p><p>Yunze Cang watched this scene, his eyes devoid of any mercy.</p><p></p><p>As an emperor, Yunze Cang was well aware that kindness to enemies was cruelty to oneself. If not for Qingyi, every Wind Roc soldier dying here now would be a murderer of his Yunlang.</p><p></p><p>As for the fleeing Wind Roc monarch, Yunze Cang was not at all afraid of him escaping, because in the moment he fled, Yexun had already given chase.</p><p></p><p>Yunze Cang had great confidence in his younger brother, for although he knew that he and Yexun were both at the peak of Shenwu, Yexun came from an ancient and unknown great family, so his combat power must be higher than their ordinary Shenwu realm.</p><p></p><p>Thinking this, Yunze Cang suddenly looked at the disheveled Wind Changxuan beside him and said to Yao'e, "Yao'er, kill him."</p><p></p><p>...</p><p></p><p>At the same time, Zhu Xingqiu smoothly entered the Observation Pavilion. As for the guards, they naturally could not detect him.</p><p></p><p>Zhu Xingqiu went up the stairs, soon arriving at a room.</p><p></p><p>This room had a shielding formation, and it should be the room where the Sect Master was.</p><p></p><p>Zhu Xingqiu then pursed his lips, carefully knocking on the door and respectfully saying, "Sect Master, Xingqiu seeks an audience."</p><p></p><p>In the room, the old turtle's movements suddenly paused, looking towards the door with a puzzled expression.</p><p></p><p>What's going on, was he hearing things?</p><p></p><p>The exhausted Dancer, noticing the old turtle's movements had stopped, was startled, but suddenly burst into tears.</p><p></p><p>In this sealed room, she didn't know how long it had been. Finally, it stopped, let it be destroyed, she was tired.</p><p></p><p>"Turtle, Turtle Lord, what's wrong?" But the Dancer still asked coquettishly, her voice a little hoarse.</p><p></p><p>At this moment, the old turtle, in a push-up position, used one hand to pinch his beard, suspiciously asking, "Did you hear any sound just now?"</p><p></p><p>The Dancer was stunned, she had only been calling out, how could she have heard any other sounds?</p><p></p><p>How strange, the old turtle decided not to think about it any further, about to continue his actions, when a respectful voice sounded from outside the door:</p><p></p><p>"Sect, Sect Master, then Xingqiu will not disturb your rest..."</p><p></p><p>The old turtle's eyes suddenly widened, huh, the Grand Steward Zhu Xingqiu?</p>

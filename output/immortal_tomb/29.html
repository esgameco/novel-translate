        <h1>Chapter 29</h1>
        <div class="content">
            <p>Here is the full English translation of the Chinese excerpt:</p><p></p><p>"Father, I'm so hungry. ‚ñë‚ñí‚ñì‚ñà‚ñ∫‚îÄ‚ïê‚ùª‚ûà≈úƒ¶ùì§x.¬¢ùêé–º ‚ïê‚îÄ‚óÑ‚ñà‚ñì‚ñí‚ñë"</p><p></p><p>"Father knows."</p><p></p><p>"Father, we've been begging in this Moyu Town for a while now, and today no one is willing to give us food anymore. Father, are you also very hungry? Should I go steal some food for you to eat?"</p><p></p><p>"Don't. Getting caught stealing is so embarrassing. Dongzi, Father plans to sell you."</p><p></p><p>"I don't want to."</p><p></p><p>On the street, a middle-aged man and a boy around 11 or 12 years old were leaning weakly against a pushcart.</p><p></p><p>Although the weather was scorching hot, the middle-aged man was wrapped in a thick coat.</p><p></p><p>The two looked weathered and exhausted, their hair disheveled, their faces gaunt with visible cheekbones.</p><p></p><p>There was a foul odor around them, indicating they had not bathed in a long time.</p><p></p><p>Passersby covered their noses and hurried past, many even casting disgusted expressions.</p><p></p><p>"This father and son, they are really shameless. At first, I saw them almost starving to death, so I specially bought them food. After eating their fill, the next day they were begging again, and they've been begging for a long time since then. I really can't understand how someone can be so shameless!"</p><p></p><p>"Yes, even the child is forgivable, he's still young and in school age, can't do much. But this father is truly despicable! With hands and feet, he can't do anything? I think he's just lazy! Who would still want to give them food? Wouldn't that be a fool's errand?"</p><p></p><p>"This child, having such a lazy and good-for-nothing father, it's really tragic."</p><p></p><p>"......"</p><p></p><p>Hearing these cruel comments scattered by the wind, the middle-aged man remained expressionless.</p><p></p><p>He only said again, "Dongzi, Father will sell you."</p><p></p><p>The boy glanced at him and still shook his head, "I don't want to."</p><p></p><p>The middle-aged man gave a slight bitter smile, looked at the boy tenderly, then fell silent, lost in thought.</p><p></p><p>Tap, tap, tap...</p><p></p><p>Suddenly, light footsteps reached the ears of the two.</p><p></p><p>The middle-aged man and the boy looked up in slight surprise, their expressions changing.</p><p></p><p>A young man in blue robes, carrying a wooden box, came and stood before them.</p><p></p><p>This was not unusual, but the young man was so ethereal and clean.</p><p></p><p>Such an elegant gentleman, doesn't he find us stinky?</p><p></p><p>This was the thought of the father and son.</p><p></p><p>Yes, with just one glance, they thought the young man was a learned scholar.</p><p></p><p>"Are you hungry?" </p><p></p><p>Lu Changsheng squatted down and asked softly.</p><p></p><p>He looked at the boy, not the middle-aged man beside him.</p><p></p><p>The boy glanced at his father, his heart clenching, feeling a bit at a loss.</p><p></p><p>"Sir, I... I..."</p><p></p><p>Grumble~</p><p></p><p>Before the boy could finish speaking, his stomach growled loudly, and embarrassment immediately showed on his face.</p><p></p><p>Lu Changsheng's expression was neither happy nor sad as he placed the wooden box in front of the boy and said softly, "Eat."</p><p></p><p>"Thank you, sir." </p><p></p><p>The boy looked at Lu Changsheng gratefully, then glanced at his weak father, reaching to open the box...</p><p></p><p>But at this moment, some disapproving passersby finally gathered around.</p><p></p><p>The boy's expression changed slightly.</p><p></p><p>"Sir, don't let this father and son deceive you. They are just begging for food and drink."</p><p></p><p>"That's right, sir, look at this dirty middle-aged man, he's clearly able-bodied, but in our opinion, he's just a lazy bum."</p><p></p><p>"......"</p><p></p><p>Hearing the passersby's words, the boy opened his mouth, his heart dejected.</p><p>This meal might be lost.</p><p></p><p>Lu Changsheng smiled faintly. "Thank you all for the kind words, I understand."</p><p></p><p>Hearing this, the passersby shook their heads helplessly and left one by one.</p><p>This gentleman, though seeming so intelligent, just wouldn't listen to reason, sigh.</p><p></p><p>"Eat."</p><p></p><p>"Huh?"</p><p></p><p>The boy looked up in surprise, dryly saying, "Sir, didn't you hear what they said? We..."</p><p></p><p>Here is the full English translation of the Chinese excerpt:</p><p></p><p>"You are a fraud," the young man said.</p><p></p><p>"No, you are not," Luchang Sheng replied.</p><p></p><p>The young man's eyes reddened, and his heart felt like a jar of mixed flavors had been overturned.</p><p></p><p>"Thank you."</p><p></p><p>The young man sniffed and thanked him, then lifted the wooden box.</p><p></p><p>Suddenly, the aroma of the food was delightful.</p><p></p><p>The young man looked at the steaming rice and colorful dishes in the wooden box, swallowing his saliva - he was so hungry. This was definitely the most sumptuous meal he had seen in a long time.</p><p></p><p>The young man carefully glanced at Luchang Sheng, then picked up the bowl and used the chopsticks to offer some food to the middle-aged man.</p><p></p><p>"Aren't you going to eat first?" Luchang Sheng suddenly said.</p><p></p><p>The young man's hand holding the chopsticks trembled, and he chuckled dryly, "Sir, my father is hungrier..."</p><p></p><p>"He is not hungry, you eat," Luchang Sheng said, still looking at the young man and not the middle-aged man.</p><p></p><p>"Cong'er, you eat first," the middle-aged man forced a smile.</p><p></p><p>The young man took a light breath, then hugged the bowl and started stuffing the food into his mouth with big bites. He even choked at times, wolfing down the food.</p><p></p><p>"I observe that you are only eleven years old, yet you seem quite mature," Luchang Sheng asked the young man.</p><p></p><p>The young man paused his eating, his cheeks puffed out, and nodded.</p><p></p><p>"You are a good son, but your father is not a good father," Luchang Sheng continued.</p><p></p><p>The middle-aged man's eyes trembled, becoming slightly moist.</p><p></p><p>Before the bewildered young man could refute, the middle-aged man said, "Sir... what you say is absolutely right."</p><p></p><p>The young man put down the bowl with a trembling hand, wanting to argue, "Sir, my father is a good father. You don't know..."</p><p></p><p>"What don't I know?" Luchang Sheng interrupted him.</p><p></p><p>The young man stared blankly at the calm, elegant man, not knowing what to say.</p><p></p><p>Luchang Sheng said softly, "You are so young, yet you have to rely on a pushcart to take your father, who is paralyzed in all four limbs, around begging everywhere. The hardship you face is beyond what an ordinary adult could endure, let alone an eleven-year-old boy. It's a miracle that you haven't died of exhaustion yet."</p><p></p><p>The young man's eyes widened, and he was stunned. The middle-aged man was also shocked to see Luchang Sheng!</p><p></p><p>After the shock, the young man did not want to dwell on the details, but trembled as he said, "Sir, I don't know how you came to know these things, but my father is paralyzed and cannot move. As his son, these are things I should do... and my father has wanted to sell me many times, thinking it would be better for me..."</p><p></p><p>"I know my father wants me to live a better life, not have to wander with him, but every time, I've refused. If I'm not by his side, my father, who is paralyzed..."</p><p></p><p>Hearing these words, the middle-aged man finally let the tears flow.</p><p></p><p>Luchang Sheng said softly, "Your filial piety is admirable, but your father has been a bit selfish as a parent."</p><p></p><p>The middle-aged man's mind was shaken, like a thunderclap.</p><p></p><p>Looking at the stunned young man, Luchang Sheng continued calmly, "He often says he will sell you, but he's just saying that to you. Even if he doesn't want you to suffer, he could simply commit suicide, so why bother saying those words."</p><p></p><p>"And you, at only eleven years old, have suffered and toiled for many years."</p><p></p><p>Regarding the middle-aged man's thoughts, Luchang Sheng naturally saw them clearly.</p><p></p><p>Listening to the unhurried words, the young man fell silent.</p><p></p><p>At this time, the middle-aged man lowered his head, and his expression could not be seen under the cover of his long hair, but his head was shaking violently.</p><p></p><p>Luchang Sheng's eyes flashed slightly. In fact, these things did not need to be evaluated by him, an outsider. He understood.</p><p></p><p>But this young man had excellent qualities and was extremely young. If this continued, he would eventually die - either from exhaustion or starvation. That would be a pity.</p>

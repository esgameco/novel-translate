        <h1>Chapter 451</h1>
        <div class="content">
            <p>Here is the full English translation of the excerpt from the Chinese novel:</p><p></p><p>Leaf Clan's Main Hall.</p><p></p><p>"Why has your clan leader not arrived yet? Such negligence, is this how you Leaf Clan treats your guests?" </p><p></p><p>The Chou Clan Leader, Chou Yuan, spoke coldly.</p><p></p><p>The clansmen behind him did not show any expression on their faces. Their clan leader could get angry, but they dared not.</p><p></p><p>After all, the Leaf Clan was now also a top-tier ancient clan, standing on equal footing with their Chou Clan.</p><p></p><p>Although the Leaf Clan's foundation was slightly shallower than theirs, it was definitely not much worse.</p><p></p><p>"Ahem, Chou Clan Leader, please forgive us. Our clan leader might have been delayed by some matters and is likely on his way here."  The Leaf Clan's Elder quickly explained.</p><p></p><p>If the Leaf Clan could be considered a newly risen top-tier ancient clan, then the Chou Clan was an old-brand top-tier ancient clan, with a gap between them.</p><p></p><p>Seeing the Leaf Clan Elder's polite attitude, Chou Yuan snorted coldly and did not continue to pressure them.</p><p></p><p>After that, both sides fell silent, occasionally glancing at each other with their eyes.</p><p></p><p>Just as Chou Yuan was about to lose patience and explode again, Ye Nantian finally appeared in the hall, smiling: </p><p></p><p>"Hehe, Chou Yuan Clan Leader, you came without notifying me in advance. That would have allowed me to prepare a little."</p><p></p><p>"Clan Leader!" The Leaf Clan Elders hurriedly greeted him with respect.</p><p></p><p>"Clan Leader Ye." The clansmen behind Chou Yuan also greeted Ye Nantian.</p><p></p><p>Chou Yuan had wanted to explode, but hearing Ye Nantian, he couldn't say anything else, as he had indeed not notified them of his arrival beforehand.</p><p></p><p>Without waiting for Chou Yuan to say anything, Ye Nantian directly asked, "Chou Yuan Clan Leader, what is the purpose of your visit today?"</p><p></p><p>Chou Yuan paused, not expecting Ye Nantian to skip the pleasantries and go straight to the main topic.</p><p></p><p>Chou Yuan then slowly stood up and looked directly at Ye Nantian, saying, "What else could it be for, if not the matter of your clan's Eternal Calamity Body!"</p><p></p><p>Eternal Calamity Body?!</p><p></p><p>Hearing this, Ye Nantian and the Elders' pupils shrank. It was actually about the Eternal Calamity Body?</p><p></p><p>They had originally thought the Chou Clan had come to cause trouble, because during the period when the Leaf Clan was a newly risen top-tier ancient clan, the Chou Clan as an old-brand top-tier ancient clan had often put pressure on them.</p><p></p><p>Ye Nantian went to the side and sat down, narrowing his eyes to ask, "Chou Yuan Clan Leader, what do you mean by this?"</p><p></p><p>Chou Yuan sneered, then said indifferently, "Hehe, Clan Leader Ye, don't pretend to not understand. Regarding your clan's Eternal Calamity Body, the Void Ancient Realm is currently outwardly calm, but many ancient clans have already started taking sides... It's the calm before the storm."</p><p></p><p>Taking sides?</p><p></p><p>Ye Nantian frowned and said, "Chou Yuan Clan Leader, I'm afraid I don't understand what you mean."</p><p></p><p>Seeing that Ye Nantian was still pretending, Chou Yuan sneered and said bluntly, "Of course it's the literal meaning. As the Clan Leader, I have come today to invite the Leaf Clan to take sides with our clan!"</p><p></p><p>What?!!</p><p></p><p>As Chou Yuan's words fell, the entire hall was shocked!</p><p></p><p>Ye Nantian even stood up abruptly from his seat, staring directly at Chou Yuan: "Chou Yuan Clan Leader... You must be joking? I will pretend I didn't hear what you just said. Chou Yuan Clan Leader, please leave!"</p><p></p><p>Saying this, Ye Nantian waved his hand and issued an order to expel the guests.</p><p></p><p>Chou Yuan raised his eyebrows and walked slowly in front of Ye Nantian, "Clan Leader Ye, when your Leaf Clan was newly risen to the top-tier ancient clan status, we Chou Clan did put some pressure on you. But that was just the established practice. Surely you don't still hold a grudge against that even now?"</p><p></p><p>Ye Nantian's face was expressionless as he said, "It's been several years already. I'm not that petty-minded."</p><p></p><p>Chou Yuan nodded, then asked, "Then won't Clan Leader Ye ask why I want you to take sides with our clan?"</p><p></p><p>"There's no need to ask. Chou Yuan Clan Leader, how you want to take sides is your clan's own private matter."</p><p></p><p>Here is the full English translation of the Chinese excerpt:</p><p></p><p>"This matter does not concern or involve Ye Nantian in any way," Ye Nantian said indifferently.</p><p></p><p>The ancient realms of the Void were not dominated by just one super ancient clan. So even if they learned that the He Clan was trying to refine the Millennium Calamity Body, although the other ancient clans were angered, they were not too panicked in their hearts.</p><p></p><p>After all, there were still the Ouyang Clan and the Hong Clan, two other super ancient clans. How could they just sit by and watch the He Clan refine it?</p><p></p><p>Seeing this, Zhou Yuan mysteriously smiled, and his lips suddenly moved, whispering something to Ye Nantian...</p><p></p><p>Very soon, Ye Nantian's expression changed!</p><p></p><p>"Haha, that's enough for today. Clan Leader Ye, you can send a message to our clan anytime when you've made a decision. I'm sure you can weigh the pros and cons clearly. Our clan leader will be waiting for your good news! Let's go!"</p><p></p><p>Zhou Yuan laughed as he waved his hand and left the hall with his clansmen.</p><p></p><p>The elders of the Ye Clan noticed that Ye Nantian's expression was off, and one of the elders hesitantly asked, "Clan leader, what did that Clan Leader Zhou Yuan say to you in the end?"</p><p></p><p>Ye Nantian shook his head heavily, suddenly remembering Lu Changsheng. At this moment, he wanted to recruit Lu Changsheng even more, because if what Zhou Yuan said was true... then the ancient realms of the Void were about to witness a bloody storm!</p><p></p><p>At that time, having an apex expert at the Divine Void Realm in the clan would add another powerful force for self-preservation.</p><p></p><p>"You all go and prepare the evening banquet, remember to make it the grandest. I'll go talk to the Patriarch and the Elder about something first."</p><p></p><p>Ye Nantian instructed and quickly left the hall.</p><p></p><p>Prepare an evening banquet? What's the occasion?</p><p></p><p>The elders looked at each other, utterly perplexed.</p><p></p><p>...</p><p></p><p>Ye Nantian quickly arrived at the Concealed Martial Pavilion and found Ye Zhuixing. His tone was a bit anxious, "Elder, will you come with me to see the Patriarch? I have something to discuss with you two."</p><p></p><p>Sitting in the rocking chair, Ye Zhuixing opened his eyes and looked at Ye Nantian for a moment before slowly nodding, "Okay."</p><p></p><p>With that, the two of them instantly disappeared, leaving only the rocking chair swaying gradually until it stopped.</p><p></p><p>...</p><p></p><p>In the depths of the Ye Clan, in a hidden realm beside a towering waterfall, an extremely aged elder was seated in meditation, unmoving like a mountain, with a unique aura emanating from him.</p><p></p><p>The deafening sound of the waterfall crashing against the rocks seemed to have no effect on the elder.</p><p></p><p>At this moment, Ye Nantian and Ye Zhuixing appeared beside the waterfall, their gaze fixed on the elder.</p><p></p><p>"Elder, the Patriarch is still in cultivation..."</p><p></p><p>Ye Nantian transmitted the message.</p><p></p><p>This was the main reason Ye Nantian had summoned Ye Zhuixing - because Ye Nantian didn't dare to wake the Patriarch from his cultivation!</p><p></p><p>This was something that the Elder had to do. After all, the Elder's seniority was not much lower than the Patriarch's, and the Elder and the Patriarch were like brothers, their relationship being quite close.</p><p></p><p>No, they were actually blood brothers!</p><p></p><p>Ye Zhuixing gave Ye Nantian a cold glance, then looked at the seated elder and called out, "Big Brother, Nantian has something he wants to discuss with you."</p><p></p><p>Ye Zhuiyue slowly opened his cloudy eyes and then gestured to Ye Nantian and Ye Zhuixing.</p><p></p><p>Ye Nantian felt relieved, quickly walking over and kneeling down, "Patriarch, I'm sorry for disturbing you."</p><p></p><p>Ye Zhuixing stood to the side, observing Ye Zhuiyue, and gradually, a trace of surprise and doubt appeared in his eyes.</p><p></p><p>"Speak quickly, what's the matter?" Ye Zhuiyue impatiently looked at Ye Nantian.</p>

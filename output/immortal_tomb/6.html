        <h1>Chapter 6</h1>
        <div class="content">
            <p>Here is the full English translation of the excerpt from the Chinese novel:</p><p></p><p>The words fell, </p><p></p><p>Chen Dadao and the steward were stunned to see that Lu Changsheng had no reaction at all, not even a furrowed brow......</p><p></p><p>The maid kneeling beside them had already been frightened pale-faced. |!¬§*'~``~'*¬§!| 6‚ùæùî∞ƒßùìæx.ùïî‚ìÑ‚ìú |!¬§*'~``~'*¬§!|</p><p></p><p>Could it be... a demonic calamity?!</p><p></p><p>"M-Master..." </p><p></p><p>Chen Dadao hesitated to speak.</p><p></p><p>Lu Changsheng gave a flick of his fishing rod, calmly saying without looking sideways, "What does a demonic calamity have to do with you? Has any demonic creature come to wreak havoc in Moyu Town?"</p><p></p><p>"Master, I've heard the demonic fiends are coming in force this time. I'm worried Moyu Town might... might get caught in the crossfire..." Chen Dadao said, his forehead beaded with sweat.</p><p></p><p>"If the sky falls, there will be someone to hold it up. You needn't lose your composure," Lu Changsheng replied indifferently.</p><p></p><p>Hearing this, Chen Dadao gave an embarrassed smile. He understood the reasoning, and this wasn't the first time demonic creatures had appeared.</p><p></p><p>Whenever demonic creatures appeared, many civilians would end up injured or dead. </p><p></p><p>And then those demonic creatures would vanish without a trace, and Chen Dadao, having witnessed immortals, guessed that immortals must have intervened.</p><p></p><p>But compared to previous times, Chen Dadao always felt this batch of demonic creatures was unusually fierce!</p><p></p><p>Their onslaught was clearly formidable.</p><p></p><p>As the lord of the town, he was naturally anxious. He had to be responsible for the hundreds of civilians.</p><p></p><p>It wasn't that he was afraid to die, he guaranteed it!!</p><p></p><p>Whoosh!</p><p></p><p>Just then, Lu Changsheng suddenly yanked his rod, and a fish broke the surface of the water, its mouth clamped onto the end of the fishing line, thrashing violently.</p><p></p><p>Soon, it was floundering right in front of Lu Changsheng.</p><p></p><p>Lu Changsheng smiled as he took the fish off, weighing it in his hand and saying, "Over four liang, a good extra meal tonight."</p><p></p><p>With that, he tossed it into the bucket behind him. </p><p></p><p>With a splash, the fish started thrashing around in the bucket, but soon fell still and silent, accepting its fate.</p><p></p><p>Chen Dadao and the steward were now standing dumbfounded, because they saw that the end of Lu Changsheng's fishing line had no hook!</p><p></p><p>He had caught the fish with just the line alone?</p><p></p><p>They could not comprehend this strange occurrence, and could only conclude that this must be an immortal's technique!</p><p></p><p>Their admiration for the young man in the azure robe only grew.</p><p></p><p>"The fish have all been scared away by your commotion," Lu Changsheng suddenly said lightly, casting his line back into the pond.</p><p></p><p>Chen Dadao flinched, and not being an idiot, immediately understood the meaning, hastily bowing and saying, "I'll take my leave, Master. Please, carry on."</p><p></p><p>He gestured to the steward, and the two of them quietly and quickly departed.</p><p></p><p>As for the maid, she remained kneeling, not daring to get up.</p><p></p><p>Having witnessed the lord's humble deference to Lu Changsheng, she now didn't even dare to breathe loudly.</p><p></p><p>"No need to kneel, you may rise," Lu Changsheng said, giving his rod a light flick.</p><p></p><p>"M-Master, your servant is more comfortable kneeling..." the maid stammered nervously.</p><p></p><p>Lu Changsheng saw this and said no more. If she wanted to kneel, then let her kneel - he hadn't forced her to.</p><p></p><p>...</p><p></p><p>Chen Dadao frowned as he walked quickly in front, when suddenly he heard the steward behind him exclaim in wonder,</p><p></p><p>"Lord, fishing without a hook - how on earth did he manage that? Before this, I wouldn't have even dared to imagine it!"</p><p></p><p>"Are you an idiot!" Chen Dadao paused in his steps, then his brow smoothed as he said enviously, "How would I know how the Master does it? The techniques of immortals are beyond the comprehension of the likes of us!"</p><p></p><p>If before Chen Dadao had harbored some doubts about Lu Changsheng, then after just now, he was completely convinced.</p><p></p><p>Fishing without a hook...</p><p></p><p>Here is the full English translation of the Chinese excerpt:</p><p></p><p>"Haha, did you really catch a fish? How could an ordinary person do that?" </p><p></p><p>The steward chuckled awkwardly.</p><p></p><p>"You're still laughing?" Chen Dadao glanced at the steward, worrying, "You know that this time, the demons are a bit different from before..."</p><p></p><p>"Master, you don't need to worry. As the gentleman said, when the sky falls, there will be someone tall enough to support it." The steward's smile remained on his face.</p><p></p><p>"Having someone tall enough to support it is good, but the demons have really appeared in our Moyu Town. And that tall person hasn't come in time, so how many civilians will be injured or killed? What are we going to do?"</p><p></p><p>Chen Dadao shook his head and sighed.</p><p></p><p>He had just gone to see Lu Changsheng, originally hoping that if demons appeared in Moyu Town, he could ask Lu Changsheng for help...</p><p></p><p>Just now, when he faced Lu Changsheng, although he didn't say it directly, the meaning was already very clear.</p><p></p><p>But... Sigh...</p><p></p><p>"Master, are you thinking about the matter of meeting the gentleman just now?"</p><p></p><p>The steward suddenly smiled.</p><p></p><p>"Are you happy about it?" Chen Dadao's face darkened.</p><p></p><p>For some reason, Chen Dadao was very unhappy looking at the steward's smile and wanted to hit him.</p><p></p><p>"Hehe, Master, don't be angry. I think you may have misunderstood the gentleman's meaning..."</p><p></p><p>The steward looked back towards the pavilion in the backyard, his eyes flashing with wisdom as he spoke.</p><p></p><p>"Oh? What do you mean by that?"</p><p></p><p>Chen Dadao raised an eyebrow, looking at the steward with some anticipation.</p><p></p><p>The steward's expression became solemn as he said in a serious tone, "Master, don't you feel that the gentleman's words and actions are full of implied meaning?"</p><p></p><p>Implied meaning? What implied meaning?</p><p></p><p>Chen Dadao looked confused, indicating that he was completely puzzled.</p><p></p><p>The steward smiled mysteriously, then respectfully said, "The gentleman said that when the sky falls, there will be someone tall enough to support it. Master, do you think it's possible that the gentleman was telling us that he is that tall person?"</p><p></p><p>Ah, that's right!</p><p></p><p>Chen Dadao's eyes suddenly lit up, pointing at the steward and excitedly exclaiming, "Continue!"</p><p></p><p>The steward continued proudly, "The gentleman said that the fish he caught was more than four liang, and he would have an extra meal tonight. Master, do you think it's possible that the gentleman was using the fish to metaphorically represent the demons?"</p><p></p><p>Chen Dadao became more and more excited, clenching his fists and slamming them down as he growled, "Exactly! That's what the gentleman meant!"</p><p></p><p>"Finally, the gentleman said that the fish had all been scared away by us. Master, what do you think the meaning of this sentence is?"</p><p></p><p>The steward asked respectfully, looking at Chen Dadao's flushed face.</p><p></p><p>This time, Chen Dadao didn't need the steward to explain, gripping his fist and quickly saying, "The gentleman is warning us to be more discreet. Just carry on as usual, and the demons won't dare to appear in our Moyu Town if they know the gentleman is here!"</p><p></p><p>Clap, clap, clap!</p><p></p><p>The steward clapped and praised, "Master, you are so smart. You immediately understood the gentleman's meaning, which I was struggling to figure out. You're really impressive!"</p><p></p><p>"Haha, you still have a lot to learn, but you're not bad either." </p><p></p><p>Chen Dadao casually waved his hand and left, humming a folk song.</p><p></p><p>At this moment, he was enlightened and in a great mood.</p><p></p><p>So what if demons were causing trouble? His Moyu Town had a celestial being guarding it!</p><p></p><p>Come one, kill one. Come two, cut down two!</p><p></p><p>"Oh, by the way, steward, don't tell the townspeople about the demons for now. If they get too panicked, it might ruin the gentleman's plan."</p><p></p><p>Chen Dadao suddenly stopped and turned to instruct the steward.</p><p></p><p>"Don't worry, Master."</p><p></p><p>The steward bowed in response.</p>

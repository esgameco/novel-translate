        <h1>Chapter 362</h1>
        <div class="content">
            <p>Here is the full English translation of the Chinese excerpt:</p><p></p><p>On the blazing celestial wheel, the expressions of the crowd were solemn. </p><p></p><p>Aoxing, the holy son of the Dragon Clan, was a powerful expert on both the Divine Body Ranking and the Individual Combat Strength Ranking!</p><p></p><p>He ranked 3rd on the Divine Body Ranking, possessing the Primordial Dragon Body, and was also the 88th strongest individual on the Individual Combat Strength Ranking!</p><p></p><p>He was far stronger than even Jian Wumei at the moment.</p><p></p><p>One should not underestimate the 88th rank, for that was the position on the entire Divine-Demonic Battlefield!</p><p></p><p>Although Aoxing was the holy son of the Dragon Clan, to people like Jian Wumei, he was still a junior.</p><p></p><p>For a junior to break into the ranks of the supreme experts on the Individual Combat Strength Ranking was truly terrifying.</p><p></p><p>Aoxing's ability to rank on the Individual Combat Strength Ranking was inseparably linked to his Primordial Dragon Body.</p><p></p><p>Not every physique on the Divine Body Ranking could make it onto the Individual Combat Strength Ranking.</p><p></p><p>For a young genius like Aoxing to rank on the Individual Combat Strength Ranking solely based on his Primordial Dragon Body was an extraordinary feat.</p><p></p><p>After all, the gap in seniority and age was a disadvantage compared to the veteran experts.</p><p></p><p>All in all, he was truly worthy of being the 3rd ranked clan on the Myriad Clan Ranking - the Dragon Clan...</p><p></p><p>"We have met the holy son, Aoxing," said Jiang Wuxin and Han Jinlong as they led the crowd in a respectful bow.</p><p></p><p>Although they were human overlords, they were still inferior to the Dragon Clan. The proper etiquette had to be observed.</p><p></p><p>Moreover, Aoxing was the holy son of the Dragon Clan and possessed immense strength. </p><p></p><p>Even the Sword Sovereign himself would likely not dare to be lax in his attitude towards Aoxing.</p><p></p><p>This was an unavoidable reality.</p><p></p><p>On the dragon palanquin, Aoxing nodded with a smile. Behind him stood nine figures, who were likely the Dragon Clan members participating in the Seven-Colored Jade Tower.</p><p></p><p>It was evident that the Dragon Clan had great trust in their holy son Aoxing, directly sending him to lead the delegation.</p><p></p><p>The nine Dragon Clan members behind Aoxing exerted tremendous pressure on Fang Yan and the others...</p><p></p><p>Suddenly, the figure in blue robes on the blazing celestial wheel caught the attention of Aoxing and the others.</p><p></p><p>It was not because of anything else, but because this person was sitting calmly without paying respects.</p><p></p><p>Seemingly sensing Aoxing's gaze, Han Jinlong and Jiang Wuxin's eyes narrowed, and they noticed Lu Changsheng sitting beside them.</p><p></p><p>The two were shocked and somewhat flustered.</p><p></p><p>Fang Yan and the others also paled, not understanding the meaning behind Lu Changsheng's actions.</p><p></p><p>"Cease-" one of the Dragon Clan members began to shout, but was interrupted by Aoxing's gesture.</p><p></p><p>The Dragon Clan member swallowed the word "attack" that was about to leave his mouth.</p><p></p><p>Like the other eight Dragon Clan members, he glared at Lu Changsheng with an unfriendly gaze.</p><p></p><p>Aoxing looked at Lu Changsheng, and after a moment of scrutiny, a strange expression flashed in his eyes before he asked with a smile:</p><p></p><p>"Golden Wheel King, Wind Sage, who is this person?"</p><p></p><p>In that brief moment, many thoughts had already formed in Aoxing's mind.</p><p></p><p>There were three seats at the table, indicating that Han Jinlong and Jiang Wuxin had also been seated there.</p><p></p><p>For this person to be sitting on equal footing with Jiang Wuxin and Han Jinlong...</p><p></p><p>It meant that his status among the human race was very high.</p><p></p><p>However, among the human race, apart from the well-known Five Overlords, he had not heard of this person before.</p><p></p><p>How intriguing...</p><p></p><p>Hearing this, Jiang Wuxin and Han Jinlong exchanged a glance from the corner of their eyes.</p><p></p><p>Jiang Wuxin stepped forward and bowed with a smile, "Holy son Aoxing, Lu Nanchu has just arrived at the Divine-Demonic Battlefield and has not yet met Holy son Aoxing. Please forgive him."</p><p></p><p>At the same time, Han Jinlong hastily transmitted a message to Lu Changsheng, "Fellow Daoist Changsheng, this person is the holy son of the Dragon Clan, of noble status. You should show some respect."</p><p></p><p>The implication was clear - they wanted Lu Changsheng to make some gesture of respect.</p><p></p><p>This was not out of cowardice, but rather to protect him.</p><p></p><p>Here is the full English translation of the Chinese excerpt:</p><p></p><p>The Dragon Clan... They are really not to be trifled with.</p><p></p><p>Hearing this, Lu Changsheng raised his brows slightly, but he did not seem too troubled. He then stood up and simply cupped his hands towards Ao Xing:</p><p></p><p>"Lu Nan."</p><p></p><p>The members of the Dragon Clan on the dragon carriage were enraged by the indifferent attitude of the young man in green.</p><p></p><p>However, Ao Xing merely raised his brows slightly and nodded lightly, without saying anything else.</p><p></p><p>Although he was the Holy Son of the Dragon Clan, his reputation on the Battlefield of Gods and Demons was excellent.</p><p></p><p>Ao Xing looked at Han Jinlong and Jiang Wuxin and smiled, "Congratulations to the human race for gaining another great general."</p><p></p><p>He naturally saw the group of nine people led by Fang Yun, and assumed that they were participants of the Seven-Colored Crystal Tower, and that Lu Nan was the leader, just like Jiang Wuxin and Han Jinlong.</p><p></p><p>Little did he know that among the nine people, Zhao Di... was actually just there to watch.</p><p></p><p>Han Jinlong and Jiang Wuxin smiled awkwardly and did not know what to say.</p><p></p><p>Seeing this, Ao Xing tactfully said, "Then I shall take my leave. We shall meet again at the Seven-Colored Crystal Tower."</p><p></p><p>With that, the massive dragon carriage suddenly accelerated, breaking through the air and quickly disappearing from the sight of the crowd.</p><p></p><p>Han Jinlong and Jiang Wuxin finally relaxed their tense nerves.</p><p></p><p>Fang Yun and the others also wiped the sweat from their brows.</p><p></p><p>Just now, facing the Dragon Clan, they had no idea how much pressure they were under.</p><p></p><p>Fang Yun and the others bowed slightly and discreetly retreated to the side.</p><p></p><p>Jiang Wuxin and Han Jinlong shook their heads lightly and sat back down at the table with Lu Changsheng.</p><p></p><p>Jiang Wuxin looked at Lu Changsheng, the words of reproach on the tip of her tongue, but she just couldn't bring herself to say them. She could only say, "Fellow Daoist Lu, that was very dangerous just now."</p><p></p><p>Han Jinlong also said, "Yes, Fellow Daoist Lu, that was the Dragon Clan, and Ao Xing is even the Holy Son. Just look at the Divine Might Ranking and the Single Combat Strength Ranking... He is a powerhouse on both!"</p><p></p><p>He raised his head to gesture towards the rankings.</p><p></p><p>On the Battlefield of Gods and Demons, those who were ranked were no ordinary individuals, let alone those who were ranked on both.</p><p></p><p>Lu Changsheng had lived even longer than them, so he should understand this.</p><p></p><p>However, Lu Changsheng had an expression as if he had heard it but also hadn't.</p><p></p><p>"Mm, I'm aware."</p><p></p><p>Ahem.</p><p></p><p>Jiang Wuxin and Han Jinlong exchanged a bitter smile and didn't say any more, afraid that if they said too much, it would annoy Lu Changsheng.</p><p></p><p>"Come, Fellow Daoist Lu, let's have a drink!"</p><p></p><p>...</p><p></p><p>The Seven-Colored Crystal Tower was located in the southwest of the Battlefield of Gods and Demons, standing tall year-round, as if connecting heaven and earth, as if existing since ancient times!</p><p></p><p>On the Battlefield of Gods and Demons, of course, there were powerful beings who wanted to claim it as their own, but no one was able to do so.</p><p></p><p>The Seven-Colored Crystal Tower was still very mysterious. Apart from being able to produce the well-known Crystal Hearts, its other special properties were unknown to all.</p><p></p><p>At this moment, at the location of the Seven-Colored Crystal Tower, there were countless figures standing around the tower, and they were all from different races!</p><p></p><p>These diverse races included some with strange and unsettling appearances, but more of them were in human form.</p><p></p><p>At this time, their gazes were intently fixed on the towering structure before them.</p><p></p><p>The Seven-Colored Crystal Tower had a total of seven layers, each emitting a different color of light, and the entire tower was wrapped in a dense array of talismans!</p><p></p><p>It was not just a simple seven-layer tower, as the entire structure was exceptionally large.</p><p></p><p>The height was approximately ten thousand zhang, piercing the clouds.</p><p></p><p>Standing below and looking up, the Seven-Colored Crystal Tower gave a sense that it could collapse at any moment!</p><p></p><p>At this moment, the main gate of the Seven-Colored Crystal Tower was tightly closed, with only flashes of light flickering, extremely captivating.</p>

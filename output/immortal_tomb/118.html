        <h1>Chapter 118</h1>
        <div class="content">
            <p>Here is the full English translation of the Chinese excerpt:</p><p></p><p>The Immortal Realm of the Martial Emperors, the Heavenly Mechanism Pavilion. ¬´-(¬Ø`v¬¥¬Ø)-¬´ ‚ûÖÔºôùê¨‚íΩùî≤ùìç.c‚ìÑùêå ¬ª-(¬Ø`v¬¥¬Ø)-¬ª</p><p></p><p>In the main hall of the Heavenly Mechanism Pavilion, all the elders and disciples of the Heavenly Mechanism Pavilion had been dispersed.</p><p></p><p>Nangong Jing stood humbly before three figures, bowing and greeting them, "Nangong pays respects to the Immortal Emperor Ling Tian, the Immortal Emperor Feng Jiu, and the Immortal Emperor Wushi."</p><p></p><p>The three figures slightly nodded their heads.</p><p></p><p>Immortal Emperor Ling Tian, dressed in a deep blue robe, had the appearance of a young man. His features were ordinary, and if not for the aura of an emperor, he could easily blend into the masses.</p><p></p><p>Immortal Emperor Feng Jiu, wearing a floor-length golden gown, was in the prime of her youth. Her fair complexion was not initially dazzling, but her eyes were like clear springs, drawing one into their depths.</p><p></p><p>&lt;tt_keyword_ad data-title="Beauty" data-tag=&quot;Recommended Products&quot; data-type=&quot;1&quot; data-value=&quot;1930&quot;&gt;&lt;/tt_keyword_ad&gt;</p><p></p><p>Immortal Emperor Wushi, dressed in a simple black robe, held a string of beads. His head was bald, and he had a slightly oily, plump appearance.</p><p></p><p>"Nangong Jing, six hundred years ago, we rushed back here as soon as we heard what you said," Wushi Immortal Emperor said solemnly, rubbing his shiny head.</p><p></p><p>Ling Tian and Feng Jiu also nodded gravely.</p><p></p><p>Because if what Nangong Jing had previously said was true, the consequences would be unimaginable.</p><p></p><p>Although they knew that Nangong Jing, as the Pavilion Master of the Heavenly Mechanism Pavilion, would not joke about such a matter, the issue was too grave, and they had to come to the Heavenly Mechanism Pavilion in person.</p><p></p><p>Nangong Jing naturally understood the implication behind Wushi Immortal Emperor's words. He smiled bitterly and said respectfully, "Immortal Emperors, for this matter, my lifespan is almost exhausted. I would not speak carelessly. When the Yin-Yang Immortal Emperor arrives, I will lead you Immortal Emperors to see the Heavenly Mechanism Mirror, and you will know the truth."</p><p></p><p>Wushi Immortal Emperor frowned and urged, "Don't wait for that old Yin-Yang fellow. Just take us to see it now!"</p><p></p><p>Ling Tian and Feng Jiu remained silent, apparently not very talkative.</p><p></p><p>Nangong Jing hesitated for a moment and said, "Then, Immortal Emperors, please follow me."</p><p></p><p>He thought to himself, "I wonder how the Immortal Emperors will react when they see the returned Immortal Emperor of Longevity..."</p><p></p><p>Just as the four were about to set out for the Rear Mountain Dao Courtyard, a figure suddenly appeared, blocking their path!</p><p></p><p>Gu Yinyang stared at Nangong Jing and urgently asked, "Where is the Immortal Emperor of Longevity?!"</p><p></p><p>Huh? The Immortal Emperor of Longevity?!</p><p></p><p>Ling Tian and Feng Jiu were startled, and even Wushi Immortal Emperor was dumbfounded!</p><p></p><p>The three imitated Gu Yinyang, all looking at Nangong Jing!</p><p></p><p>Being stared at so intently by four Immortal Emperors, even Nangong Jing, the Pavilion Master, felt his scalp tingling...</p><p></p><p>As for Gu Yinyang's question, Nangong Jing was not at all surprised, as six hundred years ago, they had made it clear to Li Hua and the others.</p><p></p><p>Li Hua and the others were fools, but Yin-Yang Immortal Emperor was certainly not stupid.</p><p></p><p>"Ahem, Immortal Emperors, six hundred years ago, the Immortal Emperor of Longevity had already returned and now resides in the Dao Courtyard," Nangong Jing replied firmly under the pressure.</p><p></p><p>"What?! The Immortal Emperor of Longevity has truly appeared?!" </p><p></p><p>The four Immortal Emperors exchanged glances, and even the usually calm Ling Tian and Feng Jiu were filled with joyful anticipation at this moment.</p><p></p><p>The next moment, the four Immortal Emperors left Nangong Jing behind and took a step towards the Rear Mountain Dao Courtyard.</p><p></p><p>They could not wait any longer.</p><p></p><p>.........</p><p></p><p>"Ahem, Immortal Emperors, you should let me explain. The Immortal Emperor of Longevity has truly been residing in the Heavenly Mechanism Pavilion for the past six hundred years," Nangong Jing said awkwardly.</p><p></p><p>He had visited L√º Changsheng recently, and now the four Immortal Emperors had arrived, but the person was nowhere to be found...</p><p></p><p>He had no idea what to do...</p><p></p><p>Here is the full English translation of the Chinese excerpt:</p><p></p><p>The four great immortal emperors could not really blame Nangong Jing for anything, as this was indeed an unavoidable situation.</p><p></p><p>"Could it be that the Immortal Emperor of Longevity is busy with something... Hehe," Shi Wushi stroked his smooth bald head and chuckled awkwardly, trying to ease the atmosphere.</p><p></p><p>Ancient Yin-Yang glanced at Shi Wushi and said, "Among the five of us immortal emperors, the Immortal Emperor of Longevity has always been the most idle."</p><p></p><p>The implication was that Shi Wushi was talking nonsense.</p><p></p><p>Chu LingtiƒÅn and Fƒìng Ji«î remained silent, but it was evident that the two were somewhat disappointed.</p><p></p><p>Shi Wushi smiled and changed the topic, "I'm sure the Immortal Emperor of Longevity will return. Nangong, please open the Mysterious Realm of the Heavenly Mechanism for us to take a look."</p><p></p><p>"Yes."</p><p></p><p>Nangong Jing, just as he had done six hundred years ago, untied the black belt and made the hand seal.</p><p></p><p>After the Heavenly Mechanism Mirror flashed with light, the terrifying scene appeared again...</p><p></p><p>A moment later, the faces of the four great immortal emperors had become grave.</p><p></p><p>Even the more lively Shi Wushi fell silent.</p><p></p><p>"Are those indistinct black shadows in the image the Y≈´mei Demonic Tribe you mentioned earlier?" Fƒìng Ji«î looked at Nangong Jing and asked in a clear, melodious yet icy voice.</p><p></p><p>Nangong Jing nodded and sighed, "That is indeed the Y≈´mei Demonic Tribe..."</p><p></p><p>Chu LingtiƒÅn's brow furrowed slightly as he asked, "Nangong Jing, you previously said that the Y≈´mei Demonic Tribe has at least ten experts at the Immortal Emperor realm, is there a basis for this claim?"</p><p></p><p>The others also looked at Nangong Jing with pursed lips, as this was too important to them.</p><p></p><p>If the Y≈´mei Demonic Tribe had at least ten Immortal Emperor realm experts, it would be a devastating blow to the Five Great Immortal Realms.</p><p></p><p>Each of the four immortal emperors could handle one, and as for the Immortal Emperor of Longevity and the old turtle...</p><p></p><p>The old turtle should be able to hold back two.</p><p></p><p>As for the Immortal Emperor of Longevity, he could probably handle two at most, three at the most!</p><p></p><p>They did not fully understand L√π Ch√°ngshƒìng's strength, but they knew he was stronger than the four of them. Otherwise, they would not have been so subservient to him for nearly ten million years.</p><p></p><p>Calculated this way, the surplus Immortal Emperor realm experts of the Y≈´mei Demonic Tribe would be beyond the ability of the Five Great Immortal Realms to handle!</p><p></p><p>In that case, the few extra Y≈´mei Demonic Tribe experts would be enough to overwhelm the Five Great Immortal Realms!</p><p></p><p>In the face of Immortal Emperors, even Immortal Saints and Immortal Kings were nothing.</p><p></p><p>Nangong Jing shook his head and sighed lightly, "LingtiƒÅn Immortal Emperor, this is not a speculation of mine, but something the Immortal Emperor of Longevity said six hundred years ago - the Y≈´mei Demonic Tribe has at least ten experts at the Immortal Emperor realm."</p><p></p><p>The Immortal Emperor of Longevity said it himself?</p><p></p><p>They immediately believed it.</p><p></p><p>L√π Ch√°ngshƒìng was always straightforward, not a man of empty words.</p><p></p><p>"Alas, how can we deal with this? Those bastards from the Ancestral Heavenly Realm are simply too overbearing! They're not leaving us the Five Great Immortal Realms any room to survive at all!" Shi Wushi's beads spun rapidly in his hand as he cursed angrily.</p><p></p><p>Ancient Yin-Yang said indifferently, "You're just good at running your mouth. Do you have any solutions?"</p><p></p><p>"Eh~ Ancient Yin-Yang, what's wrong with me? Why are you always at odds with me? What I said was the truth, why are you being so cold-shouldered?" Shi Wushi frowned, a bit irritated.</p><p></p><p>"Alright, Immortal Emperor Wushi, Immortal Emperor Yin-Yang, can't you two just calm down for a moment?" Fƒìng Ji«î sighed and furrowed her brows.</p><p></p><p>"Hmph." Ancient Yin-Yang fell silent.</p><p></p><p>"Tch." Shi Wushi also didn't feel like saying more.</p><p></p><p>"It's a good thing that the Immortal Emperor of Longevity is returning, otherwise we would be utterly powerless to resist..." Chu LingtiƒÅn finished, rubbing his brow and continuing to sigh, "We should find the Immortal Emperor of Longevity first. In this critical moment, with the storms brewing in the Immortal Realm, I won't feel at ease a single day without seeing the Immortal Emperor of Longevity."</p><p></p><p>Fƒìng Ji«î, Shi Wushi, Ancient Yin-Yang, and even Nangong Jing all nodded in agreement.</p><p></p><p>Yes, they all shared this sentiment.</p>

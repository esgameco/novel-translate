        <h1>Chapter 170</h1>
        <div class="content">
            <p>Here is my translation of the Chinese excerpt:</p><p></p><p>In the town of Qingxuan, outside the Longevity Wine Inn, a large crowd of people watched from a distance, with only a few hundred cultivators who were scheduled for the day waiting in line expectantly.</p><p></p><p>As usual, Zuo Choushan stood upright by the door, his eyes vigilantly scanning the surroundings.</p><p></p><p>Now he was extremely diligent, fully immersing himself in the role of the gatekeeper.</p><p></p><p>At this moment, Tongxin came out and laughed loudly, "I have good news to tell everyone - starting today, the daily limit of Xihun Wine has been increased to 1,000 jars."</p><p></p><p>"Wow, the shopkeeper is mighty!" </p><p></p><p>The crowd couldn't help but cheer excitedly.</p><p></p><p>This scene left many watching cultivators puzzled, curious if the Xihun Wine was truly that delicious.</p><p></p><p>These doubtful cultivators were mostly from other towns in the Heisha Domain, and had not yet tried the Xihun Wine. They wanted to drink it, but the long waiting list was truly terrifying, not knowing when their turn would come.</p><p></p><p>Tongxin lightly pressed his hand and said mysteriously, "Dear guests, don't get too excited yet, there's another big news - starting today, we will also be selling a brand new fine wine called Rumor Wine, with a daily limit of 1,000 jars!"</p><p></p><p>New wine!! </p><p></p><p>Hearing this, the crowd was stunned, then their eyes filled with tears of joy.</p><p></p><p>Even Zuo Choushan by the door was surprised, his throat rolling slightly.</p><p></p><p>In the distance, Peng Fang heard the news with delight, abruptly sitting up from his rocking chair and hurrying over. Many people made way for him, as everyone in Qingxuan knew that aside from the shopkeeper, this fat man was also a Immortal Emperor level expert.</p><p></p><p>The news spread quickly, and in no time a long line formed outside the inn, everyone eagerly anticipating.</p><p></p><p>Tongxin smiled and said, "Dear guests, whether it's Xihun Wine or Rumor Wine, the old rule still applies - each daily visitor can only purchase one jar, and you can only choose one type."</p><p></p><p>The crowd quickly nodded in agreement, this was great, this way the Longevity Wine Inn could serve two thousand customers per day, and their waiting time would be much shorter.</p><p></p><p>Soon, the first batch of twenty cultivators entered the courtyard under the envious gazes of many.</p><p></p><p>Why were they envious? The new wine, of course! </p><p></p><p>It was obvious that the first twenty jars would be enjoyed by this first group.</p><p></p><p>Inside the inn, as the crowd entered, they saw Luchang Sheng come out from the inner room. </p><p></p><p>They quickly put on smiles and respectfully greeted, "Shopkeeper."</p><p></p><p>The previous events had already spread, and now everyone knew that the shopkeeper liked to be easygoing, so they mustn't be too formal.</p><p></p><p>Even if it was an act, they had to act that way - this was the true thoughts of the cultivators.</p><p></p><p>Luchang Sheng nodded slightly and waved his hand with a smile, "Please have a seat."</p><p></p><p>He then took the rocking chair and went out to the courtyard, lying down in the warm sunshine.</p><p></p><p>"Dear guests, please have a seat. Feel free to order whatever you need," Tongxin and Lin Dong said with a smile as they wiped the tables.</p><p></p><p>"Waiter, give me a jar of Rumor Wine and a side dish."</p><p>"I want Rumor Wine too!"</p><p>"Uh, waiter, can I get half a jar of Xihun Wine and half a jar of Rumor Wine?"</p><p>"......"</p><p></p><p>At the same time, outside the Longevity Wine Inn, Xing Tian stood silently amidst the sea of people. Clad in his black armor, his tall stature and imposing aura made him stand out, causing the surrounding cultivators to keep their distance. </p><p></p><p>In this Heisha Domain, one had to remain vigilant, keeping their eyes sharp. </p><p></p><p>That fat man reclining in the rocking chair was a prime example...</p><p></p><p>In the past, who would have known he was an Immortal Emperor expert!</p><p></p><p>Here is the full English translation of the Chinese excerpt:</p><p></p><p>Not a few cultivators still remember that on the day the Longevity Wine Tavern first opened, this fatty had sat at the gambling table and ruthlessly fleeced them...</p><p></p><p>Who could have imagined that a Xian Emperor could do such an inhumane thing?</p><p></p><p>At this moment,</p><p></p><p>Xing Tian's body moved.</p><p></p><p>He broke away from the crowd and walked step by step towards the Longevity Wine Tavern.</p><p></p><p>"Eh, what does this person want to do...?"</p><p></p><p>Xing Tian's movements immediately caught the attention of many people.</p><p></p><p>This scene was remarkably similar to the arrival of the Jiang Clan Imperial Family that day.</p><p></p><p>Xing Tian ignored the many astonished gazes, did not queue up, and walked straight towards the courtyard gate.</p><p></p><p>Left Chou Shan's eyes immediately narrowed, and his inner spiritual power began to circulate, ready to strike!</p><p></p><p>But the next moment, he was stunned.</p><p></p><p>He saw Xing Tian cupping his hands politely: "Fellow Daoist, I have no ill intentions, I just want to ask if I can see the tavern keeper?"</p><p></p><p>Left Chou Shan secretly let out a sigh of relief, and the previously tense nerves relaxed slightly, also cupping his hands and saying, "Fellow Daoist, I'm sorry, my duty is only to guard the gate for the keeper, as for anything else... I have no way to help."</p><p></p><p>Knowing that the black-armored man in front of him had no ill intentions, Left Chou Shan was also very polite, because... he gave him a very strong feeling.</p><p></p><p>Xing Tian lowered his brows and asked calmly, "Then how can I see your tavern keeper?"</p><p></p><p>Left Chou Shan heard this and a registration book appeared in his hand, and he smiled, "Just register, and on the day it's your turn, you can come in to drink. Normally, as long as there are no accidents, you should be able to see the keeper."</p><p></p><p>He then picked up the pen and asked, "Fellow Daoist, what is your name?"</p><p></p><p>Xing Tian pursed his lips: "Xing Tian."</p><p></p><p>Xing Tian?</p><p></p><p>While writing in the registration book, Left Chou Shan's thoughts were also turning, the surname Xing was extremely rare, and as far as he could remember, there was no powerful figure whose surname was Xing.</p><p></p><p>"Alright." Left Chou Shan put away the book and said, "Fellow Daoist, you can come back in fifteen days."</p><p></p><p>Xing Tian was slightly surprised and said, "Fifteen days?"</p><p></p><p>"Mm, there are 30,000 people in front of you." Left Chou Shan smiled.</p><p></p><p>Xing Tian fell silent and nodded, then turned and left.</p><p></p><p>The crowd saw that this person was not here to cause trouble, and while they breathed a sigh of relief, they also felt a little disappointed.</p><p></p><p>They had thought there would be another lively scene.</p><p></p><p>But it was Peng Fang who secretly watched Xing Tian, his gaze in the depths filled with solemnity.</p><p></p><p>"Hmm?" Xing Tian seemed to sense something and turned his head to look at Peng Fang.</p><p></p><p>Peng Fang's heart skipped a beat, and he immediately averted his gaze. A few breaths later, when he looked back, the black-armored man had already disappeared.</p><p></p><p>"This person is definitely not an ordinary person." Peng Fang murmured in his heart.</p><p></p><p>At the same time, in the courtyard, Lu Changsheng's pupils flashed with a blue light, and he seemed to be lost in thought about something.</p><p></p><p>Inside the tavern, the cultivators woke up from their wine, all extremely excited.</p><p></p><p>"Whew, this Dream-Brewing Liquor is truly marvelous, haha, just now in the dream, I was the supreme overlord of the entire Heavenly Scar, the Imperial Clan didn't dare to fart in front of me, it was so satisfying!"</p><p></p><p>"Hehe, in the dream, I was the object of admiration for all the beauties of the Heavenly Scar, they fought over me, the entire Heavenly Scar... had only me as the sole man!"</p><p></p><p>"In the dream, I saw my long-deceased parents, standing alive and well in front of me... The wine of the Longevity Wine Tavern is truly unparalleled, not only delicious, but also has characteristics that no other wine has, thank you keeper for fulfilling my wish."</p><p></p><p>"I just saw the deep abyss that pierced the heavens, it was split open by a blurry figure wielding a sword... that boundless sword intent... so shocking! Even though it was just a dream, that blurry figure... I feel like I've seen it somewhere before, how strange."</p><p></p><p>"Whew! It's good that it was just a dream, otherwise I would have thought what you said was true."</p>

        <h1>Chapter 232</h1>
        <div class="content">
            <p>Here is the full English translation of the Chinese excerpt:</p><p></p><p>On the street. ‚ôôüí£Ôºñ‚ûàShuùìß.com‚ô¶üêü</p><p></p><p>The woman could tell at a glance that the two women in front of her were cultivators.</p><p></p><p>In this Yanyu Town, although almost all of them were ordinary people, they still occasionally saw the dazzling lights of cultivators passing through the sky.</p><p></p><p>It was because they had heard that there was a dangerous place far away from their Yanyu Town.</p><p></p><p>Of course, for cultivators it was not far, but for ordinary people like them, it was extremely far.</p><p></p><p>Who were Su Lianyi and Xu Jiao? As ordinary people, their emotions could not escape their perception even with the slightest change.</p><p></p><p>Through the woman's strange behavior, they knew that she must know something.</p><p></p><p>Su Lianyi's eyes flickered slightly, and she said softly with a smile, "Don't worry, we are Tong's friends, and we have no ill intentions. We've come to bring her a great opportunity."</p><p></p><p>A great opportunity?</p><p></p><p>The woman's gaze was still suspicious, but she also knew that cultivators could soar through the clouds and perform magical arts, which were beyond the reach of ordinary people like them.</p><p></p><p>"You two immortal ladies, I really don't know much about it. You'd better ask someone else," the woman said with a forced smile, then quickly left, bowing slightly.</p><p></p><p>Xu Jiao's gaze changed slightly, wanting to stop the woman, but Su Lianyi held her back, "Never mind, let's ask someone else."</p><p></p><p>Xu Jiao had no choice but to give up, muttering, "Holy Lady, why do we need to be so polite to these ordinary people?"</p><p></p><p>At this moment, a group of old men walked by, their voices full of complaints:</p><p></p><p>"Ah, Tong has been working as a medicine boy in the clinic. What are we going to do now?"</p><p></p><p>"Yes, it will be very difficult to buy medicine from Doctor Lu now. We can't let Tong know about this, or I'll lose face."</p><p></p><p>"There's only one solution. Next time, one of us will distract Tong, and the rest of us will quickly go buy the medicine!"</p><p></p><p>"Yes, Old Zhao, how about this: you prepare the food and invite Tong over, and we'll take the opportunity to buy the medicine. Don't worry, I'll buy your share too. It's on me!"</p><p></p><p>"Hiss, great idea!"</p><p></p><p>"Alright, it's settled then!"</p><p></p><p>"..."</p><p></p><p>Tong? Clinic?</p><p></p><p>Su Lianyi and Xu Jiao exchanged a delighted glance and walked over.</p><p></p><p>"Gentlemen, wait a moment," Xu Jiao called out directly.</p><p></p><p>The old men stopped and looked over, seeing two women with an immortal aura approaching them. They immediately recognized them as cultivators and hurriedly bowed.</p><p></p><p>"I..." Xu Jiao was about to speak, but was interrupted by Su Lianyi, who asked with a smile, "Gentlemen, we just overheard you talking about a clinic. Do you know where it is?"</p><p></p><p>She had learned to be smart. Since Tong was working as a medicine boy in a clinic, it would be better to ask about the clinic directly.</p><p></p><p>Asking about Tong directly might arouse the suspicion of these old men.</p><p></p><p>"You two immortal ladies are looking for Doctor Lu?" one of the old men asked with a smile.</p><p></p><p>Su Lianyi's eyes flickered slightly, and she nodded, "That's right, we are here to find Doctor Lu."</p><p></p><p>The old men looked at each other, not finding anything unusual about it. After all, the banner hanging outside the Longevity Clinic said, "Curing the illnesses of the common people and cultivators."</p><p></p><p>Having cultivators come to their door was quite normal.</p><p></p><p>They only felt a sense of admiration. Doctor Lu was truly skilled!</p><p></p><p>Even cultivators were coming to him for treatment.</p><p></p><p>Combining this with the rumors about the Chen family and the rise of Luo Valley, they couldn't help but sigh. Doctor Lu's medical skills were truly remarkable!</p><p></p><p>Then an old man pointed in a direction and said with a smile, "You two immortal ladies, Doctor Lu's clinic is that way."</p><p></p><p>Here is the full English translation of the Chinese excerpt:</p><p></p><p>The medical clinic is located in a small alley on the southwest edge of the town. You can go there and take a look.</p><p></p><p>"Okay, thank you," Suliangyi nodded, and led the expressionless Xu Jiao towards the southwest.</p><p></p><p>Watching the two beautiful figures disappear, the old men started chattering.</p><p></p><p>"Tsk tsk, the immortal beauty, what a figure..."</p><p></p><p>"Ah, don't even think about it, we're just ordinary people. We can only look. Spring Fragrance Pavilion is our true destination."</p><p></p><p>"That's right, Old Zhao, put away that lecherous gaze of yours. You don't want to be discovered, I heard cultivators have very keen senses."</p><p></p><p>...</p><p></p><p>Outside the Longevity Medical Clinic.</p><p></p><p>Suliangyi and Xu Jiao arrived.</p><p></p><p>"Longevity Medical Clinic..." Suliangyi murmured as she gazed at the four large characters dancing like dragons and phoenixes on the signboard.</p><p></p><p>"Curing all ailments of the common people, even the illnesses of cultivators? What a bold claim for this humble clinic. Miss Saint, the owner of this clinic must be a cultivator as well, for ordinary mortals would not dare to hang such a banner," Xu Jiao commented, though her eyes still held disdain.</p><p></p><p>Suliangyi nodded slightly. "For a cultivator to open a clinic in such a remote place is rather peculiar."</p><p></p><p>Xu Jiao chuckled and bowed. "Miss Saint, I wouldn't call it peculiar. In my opinion, he's likely just someone who couldn't make it out there, so he's come to this small town to swindle ordinary people."</p><p></p><p>"Let's go in and take a look. According to those people earlier, Xiao Tong is working as an apprentice here."</p><p></p><p>Suliangyi said, lifting her skirt and entering the courtyard. </p><p></p><p>Xu Jiao hesitated for a moment before following.</p><p></p><p>...</p><p></p><p>Inside the clinic,</p><p></p><p>Tongxin watched the two women enter the clinic. He had sensed they were cultivators earlier in the courtyard.</p><p></p><p>He plastered on a professional smile and approached them, ready to ask something, but was surprised to see one of the women run to the counter where Xiao Tong was and grab her arm joyfully, "Xiao Tong, you're really here!"</p><p></p><p>Suliangyi was also delighted to see Xiao Tong, inwardly relieved.</p><p></p><p>Xiao Tong was first taken aback, then recognition dawned on her face as she happily said, "Sister Xu, Sister Su."</p><p></p><p>She remembered these two sisters who had treated her to a grand meal a couple years ago, though she couldn't recall the exact time.</p><p></p><p>"Ah~" Xu Jiao responded, ruffling Xiao Tong's hair.</p><p></p><p>Suliangyi reacted, mildly surprised, "Xiao Tong, you can speak now?"</p><p></p><p>Xu Jiao also looked amazed. After all, she and the Saint had tried various methods to treat Xiao Tong two and a half years ago, but were stumped. Yet now, Xiao Tong could speak?</p><p></p><p>Xiao Tong smiled and said, "Mm, the Master here treated me and cured me."</p><p></p><p>Master?</p><p></p><p>Suliangyi and Xu Jiao exchanged a glance. They surmised that the "Master" Xiao Tong referred to must be the owner of this medical clinic.</p><p></p><p>They then looked towards Tongxin, who was also dressed as an apprentice, realizing he was not the clinic's owner.</p><p></p><p>At this moment, Tongxin seized the opportunity to politely ask, "Fellow Daoists, have you come to our Longevity Medical Clinic to seek treatment, or...?"</p>

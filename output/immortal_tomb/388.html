        <h1>Chapter 388</h1>
        <div class="content">
            <p>Here is the full English translation of the Chinese excerpt:</p><p></p><p>Regarding this tower, these Crimson Sun Palace cultivators did not dare to move it recklessly before the arrival of the Palace Master and the Elders.</p><p></p><p>The Seven-Colored Jade Tower was an extremely mysterious thing in their hearts. Who knows what would happen if they touched it.</p><p></p><p>They could only vigilantly observe the surroundings and wait silently.</p><p></p><p>Suddenly, these Crimson Sun Palace cultivators were startled, for they saw two streams of light slowly emerging from the small tower.</p><p></p><p>Finally, in their astonished gaze, they transformed into a gentle blue-robed man and a majestic black-robed man!</p><p></p><p>Ah, this... </p><p></p><p>Doesn't the blue-robed man seem familiar somehow?</p><p></p><p>And this black-robed man, he also seems to be of great importance, very formidable!</p><p></p><p>And the two of them emerged from the Seven-Colored Jade Tower, could it be that...</p><p></p><p>Oh no!</p><p></p><p>The Crimson Sun Palace cultivators were immediately thrown into a panic.</p><p></p><p>"Hmm?" </p><p></p><p>Hunhui slightly furrowed his brows, his towering figure standing before the Crimson Sun Palace cultivators, exuding a great sense of oppression.</p><p></p><p>Hunhui scanned them indifferently, "What are you all doing?"</p><p></p><p>The Crimson Sun Palace cultivators stammered a bit.</p><p></p><p>"Where is the Seven-Colored Jade Tower?"</p><p></p><p>At this moment, the voice of the Crimson Sun Palace Master arrived before his physical presence.</p><p></p><p>Soon, Moyang and a group of Crimson Sun Palace Elders appeared on the scene.</p><p></p><p>They were instantly captivated by the glittering small tower, their expressions filled with shock and doubt!</p><p></p><p>It really was the Seven-Colored Jade Tower!</p><p></p><p>But why would the Seven-Colored Jade Tower appear here?</p><p></p><p>However, when Moyang shifted his gaze to the blue-robed man, his expression suddenly became rigid and terrified!</p><p></p><p>Moyang and the group of Elders were immediately frightened out of their wits, kneeling down and trembling, "M-Master!"</p><p></p><p>Although the appearance of the blue-robed man had changed back, they knew in their hearts.</p><p></p><p>That was the great expert who had destroyed countless powerful clans with a single sword - Lord Lu Nansheng, also known as Lu Changsheng, the one standing before them.</p><p></p><p>And besides them, perhaps no one else knew that he was also the Sect Master of the Carefree Sect.</p><p></p><p>Seeing this scene, the Crimson Sun Palace cultivators were dumbfounded, but they did not dare to hesitate, hastily kneeling down and trembling.</p><p></p><p>Lu Changsheng smiled slightly, waving his sleeve to put away the Great Dao Demon-Subduing Tower, and then left with Hunhui towards the direction of the Carefree Sect.</p><p></p><p>After Lu Changsheng and Hunhui had departed for a while, Moyang and the group of Elders finally collapsed to the ground, panting heavily, their faces pale and filled with lingering fear.</p><p></p><p>After all, Lord Lu was already an extraordinary figure standing at the pinnacle of the divine and demonic battlefield. How could they not be terrified.</p><p></p><p>The sea of blood and mountains of corpses outside the human realm were still vividly etched in their minds.</p><p></p><p>"Master, that... that great lord..."</p><p></p><p>A Crimson Sun Palace cultivator asked tremblingly.</p><p></p><p>Although they had a premonition based on the glimpse of the blue robe, they still could not quite believe it.</p><p></p><p>Moyang steadied his breathing, looking at the cultivators, not blaming them. After all, it was not their fault.</p><p></p><p>He then sighed, "The great lord you just saw, do you already know who he is?"</p><p></p><p>The Crimson Sun Palace cultivators' faces stiffened, their pupils trembling.</p><p></p><p>...</p><p></p><p>"Immortal Emperor Changsheng, this Demon Emperor shall return to the Demon Realm now," Hunhui said solemnly.</p><p></p><p>Originally, Hunhui had come in a fierce manner, but he never expected it to be Lu Changsheng. Now, it was no longer a problem.</p><p></p><p>Lu Changsheng looked at the Carefree Sect just ahead and smiled, "Since I'm here, why not visit the old turtle and catch up?"</p><p></p><p>Hunhui snorted, "This Emperor has nothing to catch up with that impolite fellow. If he wasn't Immortal Emperor Changsheng's mount..."</p><p></p><p>Lu Changsheng shook his head with a smile and then led Hunhui into the Carefree Sect.</p><p></p><p>"Greetings, Sect Master!"</p><p></p><p>Within the Carefree Sect, wherever Lu Changsheng passed, the disciples were stunned for a moment, then hurriedly paid their respects.</p><p></p><p>To this, Lu Changsheng nodded with a smile, making his disciples feel as if they were basking in the spring breeze.</p><p></p><p>Here is the full English translation of the Chinese novel excerpt:</p><p></p><p>Soon, Peng Fang and the others learned that Lu Changsheng had appeared in the sect and was heading towards the main hall.</p><p></p><p>Elder Peng Fang quickly gathered the executives, protectors, and the two holy sons.</p><p></p><p>...</p><p></p><p>In the Xiaoyao Sect's main hall.</p><p></p><p>Lu Changsheng was sitting calmly above, while Hunhui was hidden in the shadows, waiting for Lu Changsheng to finish his business, then he would greet the old turtle and prepare to leave.</p><p></p><p>"We pay our respects to the Sect Master!"</p><p></p><p>Below the hall, the crowd respectfully knelt and called out in unison.</p><p></p><p>Among them were the five elders Peng Fang, the two holy sons Tong Xin and Lin Dong, as well as the old turtle and Li Shuyan.</p><p></p><p>Lu Changsheng nodded with a smile, "No need for such formalities."</p><p></p><p>The crowd stood up in an orderly manner, then looked up at the young man with fervent admiration.</p><p></p><p>This young man, who appeared refined yet extremely powerful, was their Sect Master.</p><p></p><p>Peng Fang and the others sometimes wondered how they were worthy of having such a powerful Sect Master.</p><p></p><p>Lu Changsheng waved his sleeve, and five hundred jade hearts flew towards Peng Fang, as he said, "Keep these jade hearts. Any disciple of the Xiaoyao Sect who reaches the peak of the Divine Dao realm can use them, greatly increasing their chances of breaking through to the Divine Mystery realm."</p><p></p><p>"Yes..." Peng Fang trembled as he collected the jade hearts.</p><p></p><p>Lu Changsheng nodded, then suddenly said, "I have a place that can greatly increase your cultivation speed. From now on, you should all go there and strive to have the entire Xiaoyao Sect break through to the Divine Mystery realm and beyond."</p><p></p><p>Huh?</p><p></p><p>Before the crowd could react in bewilderment, Lu Changsheng summoned the Great Dao Subduing Tower, and the small tower flew out, growing larger and larger in the stunned and confused gaze of the disciples, until a violent suction force appeared, uprooting the entire Xiaoyao Sect and drawing it into the tower.</p><p></p><p>In an instant, the Xiaoyao Sect had appeared on the third floor of the Great Dao Subduing Tower.</p><p></p><p>"What's happening?"</p><p>"Heavens, where is this place?"</p><p>"Don't panic, the Sect Master is here in the sect, no one can stir up any trouble!"</p><p>"..."</p><p></p><p>Hearing the numerous discussions echoing within the sect, Lu Changsheng smiled and said, "From now on, you shall cultivate here."</p><p></p><p>The Great Dao Subduing Tower was indeed excellent, with each floor being a separate world, allowing the Xiaoyao Sect to be carried along.</p><p>Moreover, the time flow on this third floor was different from the outside world, which was extremely beneficial for cultivation.</p><p></p><p>Afterwards, Lu Changsheng did not provide further explanation, and took the old turtle and the hidden Hunhui and left the Great Dao Subduing Tower.</p><p>As for Li Shuyan, Tong Xin, and the others, their cultivation was still low, so they should continue cultivating inside.</p><p></p><p>...</p><p></p><p>"Master, the old turtle knew you would not abandon me. The old turtle is your true love!"</p><p></p><p>Outside, the old turtle cried tears of joy.</p><p></p><p>Lu Changsheng frowned and sternly commanded, "Shut up."</p><p></p><p>In Lu Changsheng's eyes, the old turtle was merely his mount, and as long as he cultivated diligently and improved his strength, it was completely unnecessary to keep him in the tower.</p><p></p><p>The old turtle trembled and immediately became meek and obedient.</p><p></p><p>"Haha, old turtle, it's been a while."</p><p></p><p>At this moment, Hunhui revealed his form and looked at the old turtle with a leisurely smile.</p><p></p><p>"Oh ho?"</p><p>The old turtle exclaimed excitedly, "Hunhui?!"</p><p>Then he pointed at Hunhui and chuckled bitterly, "Hunhui, you really tricked me badly."</p><p></p><p>Hunhui raised an eyebrow, "When did I trick you?"</p><p></p><p>The old turtle rubbed his hands, "You're so powerful, why didn't you tell me earlier? I was a bit too harsh before."</p><p></p><p>Hunhui sneered, "It's only because of the Immortal Emperor Changsheng's face that I don't treat you like the old turtle you are. Otherwise... hmph."</p><p></p><p>The old turtle quickly moved closer to Lu Changsheng, "Master, Hunhui is threatening me."</p><p></p><p>Lu Changsheng took a deep breath and kicked the old turtle, "Scram."</p>

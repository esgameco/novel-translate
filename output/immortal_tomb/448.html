        <h1>Chapter 448</h1>
        <div class="content">
            <p>Here is the full English translation of the Chinese excerpt:</p><p></p><p>"Elder, that is the Cangwu Pavilion of our Ye Clan, where there are many techniques for our clansmen to cultivate," Ye Feng pointed to the towering pavilion ahead and said.</p><p></p><p>"Let's go take a look." Lu Changsheng glanced at it and then walked over with his hands behind his back.</p><p></p><p>Ah?</p><p></p><p>Ye Feng was immediately conflicted in his heart, feeling a bit troubled.</p><p></p><p>The Cangwu Pavilion is usually a place that only the members of the Ye Clan are allowed to enter.</p><p></p><p>"As long as it's just the first two floors, it should be fine," Ye Feng quickly made up his mind in his heart, and hurriedly followed.</p><p></p><p>"Brother Feng."</p><p>"Brother Feng."</p><p>"......"</p><p></p><p>Outside the Cangwu Pavilion, many Ye Clan disciples greeted Ye Feng, showing that Ye Feng had some status among the younger generation.</p><p></p><p>But soon, the Ye Clan disciples saw the unfamiliar face of Lu Changsheng, and their gazes became puzzled.</p><p></p><p>Who is this person? Judging from his attire, he does not seem to be from the Ye Clan.</p><p></p><p>However, the people did not dare to question him, after all, he was brought by Ye Feng.</p><p></p><p>"Elder, the Cangwu Pavilion is an important place of the Ye Clan, please allow me to go ask the Pavilion Master for permission," Ye Feng said with a smile as he looked at Lu Changsheng and bowed.</p><p></p><p>"Alright." Lu Changsheng nodded in agreement. </p><p>He naturally would not make things difficult for this Ye Feng, going through the proper procedures is fine.</p><p></p><p>"Please wait here, Elder." Ye Feng said and then went into the Cangwu Pavilion.</p><p></p><p>Lu Changsheng stood in place with his hands behind his back, unperturbed by the many curious gazes around him.</p><p></p><p>After a moment, Ye Feng quickly walked out and came in front of Lu Changsheng with a smile, gesturing, "Please, Elder."</p><p></p><p>Lu Changsheng raised his eyes to look at the "Cangwu Pavilion" sign, then stepped forward.</p><p>Ye Feng followed behind him.</p><p></p><p>After Lu Changsheng and Ye Feng entered the Cangwu Pavilion, the discussions outside started:</p><p></p><p>"Uh, that Taoist priest actually entered the Cangwu Pavilion..."</p><p>"Brother Feng must have already asked the Pavilion Master for permission. </p><p>"Yes, Brother Feng's relationship with the Pavilion Master is pretty good, so it's not surprising that he allowed that Taoist priest to go in, as long as he doesn't go to the third floor, it should be fine."</p><p>"......"</p><p></p><p>At the same time, Lu Changsheng and Ye Feng had entered the Cangwu Pavilion, and in front of them was an old man sleeping soundly in a rocking chair.</p><p></p><p>"Elder, that is the Pavilion Master of the Cangwu Pavilion," Ye Feng secretly transmitted to Lu Changsheng.</p><p></p><p>Lu Changsheng nodded, and walked past the old man without looking sideways.</p><p></p><p>At this moment, the old man who was snoring loudly suddenly opened his eyes and grinned, "Friend, may I ask your honorable name?"</p><p></p><p>Lu Changsheng paused his steps and glanced at him, "Lu Changsheng."</p><p></p><p>"To come but not return is impolite, old me is called Ye Zhuixing, the techniques in the Cangwu Pavilion, friend, you may peruse them freely," Ye Zhuixing said generously with a smile.</p><p></p><p>Whew.</p><p></p><p>Ye Feng was shocked and took a deep breath, what's going on?</p><p></p><p>Peruse freely, doesn't that mean the Pavilion Master has allowed Lu Elder to go up to the third, fourth, and fifth floors?</p><p></p><p>Lu Changsheng slightly nodded his head, and continued walking.</p><p></p><p>Ye Feng was about to follow, but was suddenly pulled back by Ye Zhuixing, "Ye Feng, you stay here and chat with this old man about life."</p><p></p><p>"Oh..." Ye Feng had no choice but to stop.</p><p></p><p>Ye Zhuixing turned his head and saw the figure in blue robes disappear, his gaze flashing with seriousness, then he asked Ye Feng, "This person is..."</p><p></p><p>Ye Feng knew the Pavilion Master was asking about Lu Changsheng, so he respectfully replied, "Pavilion Master, the Elder is the one who came back with Uncle Xunwang, Uncle Xunwang told me to treat the Elder well, but I don't know anything else."</p><p></p><p>Xunwang?</p><p></p><p>Ye Zhuixing was startled: "Ye Xunwang?"</p><p></p><p>"Yes, Uncle Xunwang just returned today, you've been holed up in the Cangwu Pavilion all this time, so it's normal that you're out of the loop on the news," Ye Feng said with a touch of sarcasm.</p><p></p><p>"Heh, you little rascal--" Ye Zhuixing raised his hand as if to slap him.</p><p></p><p>Ye Feng braced himself...</p><p></p><p>Here is the full English translation of the Chinese excerpt:</p><p></p><p>Hurriedly taking a step back, he smiled awkwardly and then quickly leaned in again, frowning as he asked, "Elder, why did you allow the Honored One to fully peruse the Armory Pavilion?"</p><p></p><p>Although Lord Lu did not have the Ye Clan's bloodline and could not enter the fifth layer, the techniques in the third and fourth layers were already extremely precious.</p><p></p><p>Ye Chui Xing saw Ye Feng ask about this matter, and his eyes flashed as he smiled and said, "The techniques in the Armory Pavilion may be treasures to you all, but that friend Lu perhaps does not value them highly."</p><p></p><p>Ah?</p><p></p><p>Ye Feng was startled, for even the techniques of the third layer were already suitable for Deity Realm cultivators to practice, and some of the techniques in the fourth layer were even coveted by many powerful Deity Realm experts.</p><p></p><p>Lord Lu actually does not value them? </p><p></p><p>Is this for real?</p><p></p><p>Ye Chui Xing did not respond to the shocked Ye Feng, but instead pondered for a moment before standing up and dusting off his buttocks, saying, "Ye Feng, you first watch over this old man for me."</p><p></p><p>Having said that, he disappeared in a flash.</p><p></p><p>"Yes, Elder." Although Ye Feng did not know what was going on, he still immediately complied. Afterwards, he looked at the rocking chair, smacked his lips, cleared his throat, and then lay down, sighing, "Ah, this is so comfortable. No wonder the Elder spends his days holed up in the Armory Pavilion. If I could have such a position, I, Ye Feng, could do it until I die."</p><p></p><p>...</p><p></p><p>On the other side, Ye Nan Tian personally arranged for the unconscious Ye Xun Wang to rest, and then went out of the room. </p><p></p><p>The suddenly appearing figure caused Ye Nan Tian's footsteps to pause as he exclaimed in surprise, "Elder?"</p><p></p><p>Ye Chui Xing glanced into the room and said, "This little Xun Wang seems to have been overcome with grief."</p><p></p><p>Ye Nan Tian was slightly startled, not expecting the Elder to specially come to check on Ye Xun Wang?</p><p></p><p>But soon, Ye Nan Tian denied this idea, as his nephew was not that close to the Elder.</p><p></p><p>For someone like the Elder, Ye Nan Tian even doubted that he would come out of the Armory Pavilion even if the Clan Leader himself died.</p><p></p><p>"Elder, do you have something you need to tell me?" Ye Nan Tian asked hesitantly.</p><p></p><p>Although both their appearances were aged, from Ye Nan Tian's attitude, the Elder's seniority was undoubtedly higher than his.</p><p></p><p>"Let's talk as we walk." Ye Chui Xing glanced at him and then turned to leave.</p><p></p><p>Ye Nan Tian followed with a puzzled gaze.</p><p></p><p>...</p><p></p><p>"What?! The one who came back with Xun Wang is also a suspected top-tier expert at the Deity Void Realm??" </p><p></p><p>After hearing Ye Chui Xing's summary, Ye Nan Tian couldn't help but exclaim.</p><p></p><p>After the shock subsided, Ye Nan Tian quickly looked at Ye Chui Xing, "Elder, what is the relationship between that Deity Void expert and Xun Wang?"</p><p></p><p>Ye Chui Xing's footsteps paused, and he glanced at Ye Nan Tian impatiently, "This old man was actually going to come ask you, but it turns out you don't know anything either. Sigh."</p><p></p><p>Ye Nan Tian felt a little embarrassed and gave a bitter smile.</p><p></p><p>How could he know? The subordinates hadn't said anything, and Xun Wang was immersed in the pain of losing his parents, not even mentioning this.</p><p></p><p>"Nevermind, just leave it be. When the time comes, be sure to treat that friend Lu well. This old man is going back to the Armory Pavilion now."</p><p></p><p>Remembering that Lu Changsheng was still in the Armory Pavilion, Ye Chui Xing instructed him and then disappeared in a flash.</p><p></p><p>"Elder, rest assured, I understand." Ye Nan Tian hurriedly bowed.</p><p></p><p>After straightening up, Ye Nan Tian's eyes flashed, and he quickly turned and headed back to Ye Xun Wang's room.</p><p></p><p>Creaking, Ye Nan Tian pushed open the door and saw the still unconscious Ye Xun Wang on the bed. He then decisively walked over and slapped Ye Xun Wang's face:</p><p></p><p>"Xun Wang, wake up first, your uncle has something to ask you."</p>

        <h1>Chapter 10</h1>
        <div class="content">
            <p>Here is the full English translation of the Chinese excerpt:</p><p></p><p>The pavilion fell into silence. ╰☆☆ 69th book.com ☆☆╮</p><p></p><p>Chen Dadao and the steward knelt on the ground, their bodies slightly trembling.</p><p></p><p>After a long while, Chen Dadao spoke hoarsely, "I know the affairs of the town have nothing to do with you, sir. Whether you get involved is entirely up to you, but the townspeople..."</p><p></p><p>Luchang suddenly looked up at the night sky and said, "Do you want to cultivate immortality?"</p><p></p><p>Chen Dadao was stunned, then immediately overjoyed. "Yes! Yes! I've dreamed of cultivating immortality!"</p><p></p><p>"I can let you cultivate immortality, but as for the demons in this town... I'm afraid I can't do anything about that," Luchang said indifferently.</p><p></p><p>The joy on Chen Dadao's face visibly faded, and he quickly bowed respectfully, "Sir, then I won't cultivate immortality. Please take action to eliminate the demons in the town. I will set up a memorial tablet for you and worship it for the rest of my life!"</p><p></p><p>Luchang's eyes flickered as he said, "Are you sure you don't want to cultivate immortality? Soaring through the skies and living as long as the heavens are not impossible."</p><p></p><p>Chen Dadao gave a bitter smile. "Sir, if I were to disregard the lives of the townspeople and only pursue my own interests, I would despise myself. I'm afraid that path of immortality would be fraught with difficulties, so I won't cultivate it."</p><p></p><p>Luchang nodded. "Then so be it. You may leave now."</p><p></p><p>Is the sir still unwilling to take action? Chen Dadao and the steward felt anxious in their hearts as they looked up.</p><p></p><p>But the figure of the man in the blue robe had vanished!</p><p></p><p>"Oh, and you don't need to set up a memorial tablet."</p><p></p><p>Suddenly, a light voice sounded, causing the two to tremble violently, their excitement overflowing!</p><p></p><p>The sir is willing to take action!</p><p></p><p>...</p><p></p><p>At the city gate of Jia Yuan City, ten figures stood facing the wind.</p><p></p><p>They were the disciples of the Qingyun Sect who had arrived.</p><p></p><p>Tongxin looked at the black mist shrouding the city and sniffed, "There is indeed a demonic aura..."</p><p></p><p>"Senior Brother Tong, what should we do?" one of the disciples asked, looking at the city guards.</p><p></p><p>They had applied invisibility talismans, so the guards couldn't see them.</p><p></p><p>Tongxin's lips curled into a smile. "Naturally, we'll eliminate the demons before the invisibility talismans wear off, and then move on to the next city."</p><p></p><p>With that, he leaped up onto the city wall.</p><p></p><p>The other disciples excitedly followed suit.</p><p></p><p>Meanwhile, in Jia Yuan City, the lights were bright, but the atmosphere was gloomy and lifeless. There were few people on the streets...</p><p></p><p>Due to the recent mysterious deaths of many townspeople, everyone was afraid to extinguish their lights at night, and they didn't dare sleep too deeply, fearing they might never wake up.</p><p></p><p>Amid this panic, many townspeople wanted to flee Jia Yuan City, but the city had been completely sealed off by the lord, with no one allowed in or out.</p><p></p><p>Those who disobeyed were mercilessly killed by the city guards, setting an example for the others.</p><p></p><p>Every day, more townspeople died, and with the city lord's lockdown measures, many began to suspect that demonic creatures were behind the calamity.</p><p></p><p>The townspeople grew increasingly panicked, and in this torturous environment, they might soon rise up and attempt to break out of Jia Yuan City.</p><p></p><p>In the lord's manor, the lord of Jia Yuan City was also under immense physical and mental stress.</p><p></p><p>The number of deaths in the city had already reached four hundred and was still rising.</p><p></p><p>He still vividly remembered the orders from above: "No matter what happens, do not open the city! Wait for the immortal to arrive and eliminate the demons!"</p><p></p><p>"When will the immortal arrive... The townspeople's mentality is on the verge of collapse. If the immortal doesn't come soon, Jia Yuan City is doomed," the city lord lamented helplessly.</p><p></p><p>Suddenly, there was a knock on the door!</p><p></p><p>The city lord was startled and quickly looked through the curtain, but saw no one... He was about to shout in fear when he was stunned to hear...</p><p></p><p>Here is the full English translation of the Chinese excerpt:</p><p></p><p>"So you are the lord of this Jia Yuan City? Quickly issue an order that no matter what noises are heard within the city later, all the civilians are not allowed to go out and watch!"</p><p></p><p>Outside the door, Tong Xin finished speaking and was about to leave.</p><p></p><p>Hearing the young man's voice outside the door, the lord of Jia Yuan City let out a slight sigh of relief, but why did he only hear his voice and not see him? Suddenly, he seemed to realize something and asked hopefully, "Wait, you, you are...?"</p><p></p><p>Outside the door, Tong Xin pursed his lips, his face flushed with embarrassment as he said, "A Immortal."</p><p></p><p>After saying that, he fled as if escaping!</p><p></p><p>For others to call him an Immortal, he could barely accept it, but for him to say it himself, he was truly uneasy about it!</p><p></p><p>How could an Immortal call himself an Immortal?</p><p></p><p>Moreover, he was still in the Foundation Establishment stage...</p><p></p><p>"Immortal!" The lord of Jia Yuan City's eyes lit up, and he immediately waved his hand and shouted, "Summon the people! Transmit the order of the lord of this city, that tonight all the people in the city are to stay at home with their doors closed, and no one is allowed to go out no matter what noises are heard!! Those who disobey will be executed without mercy!"</p><p></p><p>"Yes!"</p><p></p><p>...</p><p></p><p>"Senior Brother Tong, you're back." </p><p></p><p>Seeing Tong Xin return, the disciples knew that everything had been arranged.</p><p></p><p>"Mm." Tong Xin responded as he scanned the surroundings.</p><p></p><p>"Senior Brother Tong, how should we find the demon? It's hidden in the dark, and it will take a lot of time to find it."</p><p></p><p>Just as the disciples were frowning, unsure of what to do next,</p><p></p><p>they saw Tong Xin flip his palm, and an ancient spiritual plate appeared in his hand.</p><p></p><p>Instantly, the ten outer disciples were stunned, and some even blurted out,</p><p></p><p>"A mid-grade spiritual treasure, the Demon-Seeking Spiritual Plate!"</p><p></p><p>"That's right, my junior brothers and sisters are quite knowledgeable. This is the Demon-Seeking Spiritual Plate that my master bestowed on me in the past."</p><p></p><p>Tong Xin said with a touch of pride.</p><p></p><p>At this moment, he also realized why his master had sent him here instead of some of the other direct disciples. It must be related to him possessing the Demon-Seeking Spiritual Plate!</p><p></p><p>The disciples looked at the Demon-Seeking Spiritual Plate in Tong Xin's hand with envy.</p><p></p><p>This was a rare spiritual treasure, and it was even at the mid-grade level!</p><p></p><p>For these disciples in the Qi Refining stage, they didn't even dare to dream of it.</p><p></p><p>As for magical treasures and spiritual treasures, those were even more unattainable.</p><p></p><p>Of course, even if they were given those, they wouldn't be able to use them, as their Qi Refining stage cultivation would severely limit them.</p><p></p><p>They only had some common tools used by Qi Refining cultivators, such as knives, swords, sticks, and even shoes and clothes...</p><p></p><p>The simple tools like shoes and clothes were even provided by the sect, and every disciple had them.</p><p></p><p>The clothes not only kept them warm in winter and cool in summer, but they could also automatically clean themselves, and they wouldn't get dirty even if they weren't washed for a long time. The shoes even had speed attributes.</p><p></p><p>As for a mid-grade spiritual treasure, perhaps even some fellow disciples at the Foundation Establishment stage like Senior Brother Tong didn't have one.</p><p></p><p>Although the Demon-Seeking Spiritual Plate was a specialized treasure without any attack or defensive properties, it was still impressive!</p><p></p><p>Senior Brother Tong was truly the most beloved disciple of the ancient elder...</p><p></p><p>Seeing the disciples practically drooling, Tong Xin felt immensely proud. At this moment, he felt very respected and couldn't help but encourage them:</p><p></p><p>"Hehe, that's enough, my junior brothers and sisters. You don't need to be envious. Keep cultivating diligently, and one day when you reach the Foundation Establishment stage, you will also be able to obtain the spiritual treasures you've been dreaming of."</p><p></p><p>"We will heed Senior Brother Tong's words." </p><p></p><p>The disciples hurriedly clasped their fists and bowed.</p><p></p><p>"Mm." Tong Xin nodded, his expression gradually becoming more serious. "Now, let's find the location of the demon... I want to see what kind of vile creature dares to wreak havoc in the territory under the control of our Qing Yun Sect!"</p><p></p><p>With that, Tong Xin activated the liquid spiritual energy within his body, and strands of spiritual energy were transmitted into the Demon-Seeking Spiritual Plate.</p><p></p><p>Immediately, Tong Xin released the Demon-Seeking Spiritual Plate, and it began to float in the air.</p><p></p><p>"Beep beep beep" The indicator needle inside the spiritual plate started spinning frantically!</p><p></p><p>In just a moment, the needle locked onto a direction, and the Demon-Seeking Spiritual Plate quickly flew towards that direction.</p><p></p><p>The disciples watched with envy, silently admiring how the spiritual treasure had such spirituality.</p><p></p><p>Tong Xin's eyes lit up, and he shouted, "Let's go! Follow the Demon-Seeking Spiritual Plate!"</p>

        <h1>Chapter 162</h1>
        <div class="content">
            <p>Here is the full English translation of the Chinese excerpt:</p><p></p><p>Aside from the madam and the courtesans of the Red Boudoir, the cultivators were all excitedly looking at Lu Changsheng. üëΩ‚ôõ‚ûÖ‚ùæ≈úùê°√πùêó.·ëï‡πèÔΩçüê∏‚ô°</p><p></p><p>Meeting the manager of the Longevity Inn at the Red Boudoir today was something they could boast about for a long time.</p><p></p><p>However, the cultivators soon noticed that the atmosphere was a bit off and fell silent.</p><p></p><p>The next moment, the madam, along with the courtesans of the brothel, all knelt down, and she anxiously said:</p><p></p><p>"Manager, please forgive our blindness."</p><p></p><p>Many of the newly arrived cultivators were puzzled by the sight, and then were informed by the people around them, finally understanding the whole story.</p><p></p><p>Their eyes suddenly flashed with interest, and their gaze towards the madam and the others was tinged with mockery.</p><p></p><p>Well, the Red Boudoir has quite the audacity to have chosen the manager!</p><p></p><p>Nowadays in Qingxuan Town, the lord of the Tianshefang, Left Qiushan, was a guard at the Longevity Inn, the boss of the Huge Axe Gang, Su Qianghe, was the manager's little admirer, and the Daoguai and Yingyoulou were also very respectful towards the inn manager.</p><p></p><p>It can be said that in Qingxuan Town, if you offend the manager of the Longevity Inn, Lu Changsheng, then you have no way up in the heavens or down on earth...</p><p></p><p>At this moment, Lu Changsheng took a few steps forward.</p><p></p><p>The madam and the others immediately bowed their heads, like startled birds, their hearts trembling.</p><p></p><p>Unexpectedly, Lu Changsheng calmly smiled and said, "Forgive what? What have you done wrong?"</p><p></p><p>Everyone was stunned, their brains unable to catch up.</p><p></p><p>The madam and Red Carp were also trembling, not understanding Lu Changsheng's meaning.</p><p></p><p>Lu Changsheng then casually waved his hand, producing a seven-colored spirit stone, which he pushed towards Red Carp, lightly chuckling, "Your dancing is not bad, and your eye for talent is also acceptable, but a moment of spring pleasure is enough."</p><p></p><p>Having said that, he turned and walked out, with Peng Fang following behind him, smiling.</p><p></p><p>The crowd parted in bewilderment, bowing respectfully as Lu Changsheng left.</p><p></p><p>After Lu Changsheng's departure, the Red Boudoir fell silent again.</p><p></p><p>After a moment, a cultivator suddenly slapped his forehead and laughed, "Haha, that's right, the manager is truly a person of noble character. Thinking about it carefully, the Red Boudoir didn't really do anything wrong. Red Carp choosing the manager among so many people just shows that the manager is exceptionally handsome and extraordinary, doesn't it?"</p><p></p><p>"Yes, looking at it this way, if they hadn't chosen the manager, that would have meant the Red Boudoir was blind, wouldn't it?"</p><p></p><p>Immediately, all the cultivators understood, expressing their admiration and flattery.</p><p></p><p>Through this incident, they also gained some understanding of this mysterious inn manager. He was definitely not the kind of person who bullies men and oppresses women, and his temperament was not as cold and aloof as they had imagined, but rather very approachable.</p><p></p><p>Although from a rational point of view, the Red Boudoir had not done anything wrong, they knew that if the same incident had happened to the forces of the Huge Axe Gang or the Daoguai, they would most likely have demanded some compensation by taking advantage of their power.</p><p></p><p>After all, this was the Black Snake Domain, where there were not many people who would reason things out, only those with fists.</p><p></p><p>And Left Qiushan, Su Qianghe, Yin Jiuguai, Zhao Wurou, and even the mysterious Peng Fang were not exactly good people either.</p><p></p><p>They only acted that way towards Lu Changsheng.</p><p></p><p>Aside from the interest in the Xihun Liquor, they were more afraid of Lu Changsheng himself.</p><p></p><p>In fact, no matter what Lu Changsheng did today in this Red Boudoir, the cultivators would all think it was right.</p><p></p><p>This was the power of absolute strength.</p><p></p><p>The madam and the others regained their composure. The tension in their nerves had relaxed.</p><p></p><p>Beads of cold sweat had formed on their foreheads, and they sighed inwardly, feeling as if they had just walked through the gates of the underworld.</p><p></p><p>Fortunately, the manager of the Longevity Inn was somewhat extraordinary.</p><p></p><p>Red Carp stared blankly at the seven-colored spirit stone still floating in front of her, then firmly grasped it and carefully put it away.</p><p></p><p>The madam let out a sigh of relief and smiled at the cultivators, "Gentlemen, you are..."</p><p></p><p>"Haha, many of us have heard about the manager's appearance at the Red Boudoir..."</p><p></p><p>Here is the full English translation of the Chinese excerpt:</p><p></p><p>"Well, come and take a look. Even the manager of your Red Boudoir has come, and the manager has praised it. It seems quite good. Then let's play a bit today, my fellow Daoists, what do you say?"</p><p></p><p>"Haha, of course! Play, play to our heart's content!"</p><p></p><p>"Haha, old madam, I want ten."</p><p>"I'll take twenty."</p><p>"......"</p><p></p><p>In an instant, the Red Boudoir became bustling with activity, a scene never before seen.</p><p></p><p>Even on the day the Red Boudoir opened, it was far from as lively as today.</p><p></p><p>This... truly is the terrifying celebrity effect.</p><p></p><p>The old madam was delighted and increasingly revered Lu Changsheng. She had arranged for a long time before she could accommodate all the many guests.</p><p></p><p>She summoned Red Carp and carefully looked her over, her eyes twinkling with a smile: "Red Carp, are you willing to be our Red Boudoir's top courtesan?"</p><p></p><p>Red Carp's pupils dilated, her lips slightly parted, somewhat stunned.</p><p></p><p>Didn't the Red Boudoir just recently appoint a new top courtesan? How could they now make her, who had just arrived at the Red Boudoir, the top courtesan?</p><p></p><p>The old madam smiled and said, "What happened at the Red Boudoir today will surely spread throughout Qingxuan. We have been blessed by the manager, and the coming period will likely be extremely busy. The other brothels in Qingxuan Town may not be able to match our Red Boudoir."</p><p></p><p>"And you, you have the good fortune of being praised by the manager of the Long Life Tavern. From now on, you will be our Red Boudoir's cash cow. But don't worry, your mother won't cheat you. A 50-50 split, how about that? Oh, and you don't have to offer your body as the top courtesan."</p><p></p><p>The old madam spoke in an extremely seductive voice.</p><p></p><p>No need to offer her body?</p><p></p><p>Red Carp's eyes lit up.</p><p></p><p>She didn't really care about the 50-50 split, but not having to offer her body was something she cared a lot about!</p><p></p><p>"Mother madam, Red Carp is willing," she immediately replied eagerly.</p><p></p><p>The old madam nodded in satisfaction, then suddenly said solemnly, "Red Carp... the manager of the Long Life Tavern... you must not set your sights on him..."</p><p></p><p>Red Carp paused, then lowly said, "Mother madam, Red Carp understands."</p><p></p><p>The old madam smiled, "Good that you understand."</p><p></p><p>...</p><p></p><p>After leaving the Red Boudoir, Lu Changsheng strolled around other parts of Qingxuan Town with Peng Fang, and the day passed quickly.</p><p></p><p>The pale moon slowly rose, and the dark void of the sky grew gloomy.</p><p></p><p>"Senior, you've returned."</p><p></p><p>At the gate of the Long Life Tavern, Zuo Qianshan saw the returning Lu Changsheng and hurriedly bowed.</p><p></p><p>"Sir, you're back. Those guests left not long ago."</p><p></p><p>Tongxin and Lin Dong heard the movement outside and quickly ran out.</p><p></p><p>Lu Changsheng nodded slightly, ignoring Zuo Qianshan, and strode into the courtyard.</p><p></p><p>With a thud, the courtyard gate closed.</p><p></p><p>Zuo Qianshan sighed slightly, exhaled a white breath, and stood up straight, carefully watching the gate.</p><p></p><p>On this Black Demon Domain night, the weather was still a bit cold, but for cultivators, it made little difference.</p><p></p><p>The night moon hung in the sky, and it was unclear what hour it was.</p><p></p><p>With a creak, the courtyard gate opened, and Tongxin came out, carrying a bowl and bringing it to Zuo Qianshan, smiling, "This is the soup the master has bestowed upon you. He said it's cold outside, please have a bowl."</p><p></p><p>Zuo Qianshan stared blankly at the soup, and although cultivators would not feel hot or cold, his heart was somewhat chilled in this frigid night.</p><p></p><p>But at this moment, his heart had warmed considerably.</p><p></p><p>He took the soup and smiled, "Thank the manager for me."</p><p></p><p>Zuo Qianshan had been guarding the gate for over half a month, so he naturally knew that the "master" Tongxin mentioned was Lu Changsheng.</p><p></p><p>Tongxin giggled and bounced back into the courtyard.</p><p></p><p>Zuo Qianshan looked down at the soup in the bowl, paused for a moment, then tilted his head back and drank it in one gulp.</p><p></p><p>As a surge of powerful warmth rose from his abdomen and radiated throughout his limbs, his eyes widened in surprise.</p>

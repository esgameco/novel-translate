        <h1>Chapter 344</h1>
        <div class="content">
            <p>Here is my translation of the Chinese excerpt:</p><p></p><p>Miu Fan and Kong Zhen stood up, and the two looked at each other.</p><p></p><p>"Kong Zhen, as the person involved, you should be the one to tell King Lun about this," Miu Fan said.</p><p></p><p>The person involved? </p><p></p><p>Han Jinlong raised his eyebrows, not quite understanding, and looked at Kong Zhen, waiting for him to continue.</p><p></p><p>"Your Majesty King Lun, we have come to ask you about something..." Kong Zhen hesitated for a moment before continuing cautiously, "There has appeared a mysterious Taoist priest in our human territory, one we have never heard of before."</p><p></p><p>?</p><p></p><p>Han Jinlong's brow furrowed as he asked, "A Taoist priest? What do you mean? Explain in more detail."</p><p></p><p>"Your Majesty, it's like this - today, Miu Fan and I were battling at the city arena..." </p><p></p><p>Kong Zhen quickly recounted the events that had occurred at the arena. </p><p></p><p>As he listened, the furrow in Han Jinlong's brow grew deeper, until when he heard that the Taoist priest had easily controlled Kong Zhen's mind, his gaze finally sharpened.</p><p></p><p>Seeing this, Miu Fan respectfully spoke up:</p><p></p><p>"Your Majesty, that is how the situation unfolded. In fact, we have come to ask, when did our human race produce such a figure?"</p><p></p><p>Han Jinlong's eyes flickered, but he did not answer, instead asking in return, "Are you certain that Taoist priest is from the human race?"</p><p></p><p>Hearing this, Miu Fan and Kong Zhen solemnly nodded. Of course he was human - they had confirmed this immediately. If he were from another race, they would have sensed it right away.</p><p></p><p>Seeing the two confirm the Taoist priest was human, Han Jinlong's expression visibly relaxed, as he said impatiently, "Since he is human, then why have you come to me about this? What, are you unhappy that our human race has produced a powerful cultivator?"</p><p></p><p>"Cough cough cough cough." Miu Fan and Kong Zhen coughed awkwardly - that was certainly not their intention. </p><p></p><p>They were naturally delighted that the human race had gained another powerful cultivator. It's just that there were only around a hundred human Transcendent Immortal cultivators total, and they were all basically acquainted with each other. </p><p></p><p>So this Taoist priest who had seemingly appeared out of nowhere had them greatly curious.</p><p></p><p>Han Jinlong understood what Miu Fan and Kong Zhen meant, and then said, "So where is this Taoist priest now?"</p><p></p><p>Miu Fan quickly replied, "Your Majesty, that Taoist priest is still in our human city."</p><p></p><p>Slap!</p><p></p><p>Han Jinlong lightly slapped Miu Fan's head, quite exasperated. "Doesn't your King know where he is in the human city?"</p><p></p><p>Miu Fan rubbed his head and laughed awkwardly, "No, we don't know."</p><p></p><p>Han Jinlong rolled his eyes and said, "You two go back and search for this person in the human city. As soon as you find him, come report to me immediately."</p><p></p><p>"Yes."</p><p></p><p>Miu Fan and Kong Zhen bowed and took their leave.</p><p></p><p>On this trip, they had gotten the answer they were seeking - even the King didn't recognize this Taoist priest. No wonder they didn't know him.</p><p></p><p>After Miu Fan and Kong Zhen left, </p><p></p><p>Han Jinlong pursed his lips, his gaze seeming to pierce through the buildings to the city beyond. To be able to control Kong Zhen's mind so easily?</p><p></p><p>He asked himself, if he wished, he could easily do the same, given his cultivation level. But he was no ordinary person - he was one of the five human Overlords of the Divine-Demonic Battlefield!</p><p></p><p>One thing was certain - Miu Fan and Kong Zhen truly did not recognize this so-called Taoist priest. </p><p></p><p>Since there were only around a hundred human Transcendent Immortal cultivators, and Miu Fan and Kong Zhen didn't know him, then naturally he himself didn't know the person either.</p><p></p><p>How mysterious...</p><p></p><p>No, he had to go to the city himself to search for this person. Even though Miu Fan and Kong Zhen confirmed he was human, there was no guarantee he wasn't from another race.</p><p></p><p>Here is the full English translation of the Chinese excerpt:</p><p></p><p>He had to confirm it. If that azure-robed cultivator possessed some rare and special techniques to infiltrate their human domain, it was hard to say how much damage it could cause.</p><p></p><p>Thinking this, Han Jinlong brushed his hand across his face, transforming into the appearance of a young man. His symbolically golden battle armor also changed into a black robe, and finally, with a flick of his hand, a folding fan appeared, and he disappeared with a single step.</p><p></p><p>.........</p><p></p><p>The city was bustling with activity, discussions erupting from all sides, even more intense than before.</p><p></p><p>Apart from the changes in the rankings of Miao Fan and Kong Zhen on the battle list, the topic that the cultivators discussed the most was the mysterious azure-robed cultivator who had appeared in the square.</p><p></p><p>He was an existence that even Senior Kong Zhen respectfully saluted.</p><p></p><p>Senior Kong Zhen paid his respects to him, and all the people present at the time witnessed this, which could not be faked.</p><p></p><p>The cultivators were curious - just who was this azure-robed cultivator? One thing was certain, he was not from their human city, after all, they were familiar with the powerful figures on the battle list.</p><p></p><p>......</p><p></p><p>Kong Zhen and Miao Fan sent people, and even personally searched the city for Lu Changsheng.</p><p></p><p>Several days passed, but they found nothing.</p><p></p><p>Even Han Jinlong, in the short time, could not locate Lu Changsheng. It was understandable, the human city was too vast, with at least a hundred million people. Trying to find one person was like searching for a needle in the ocean.</p><p></p><p>Han Jinlong returned to the main palace, helpless.</p><p></p><p>But just after he returned, Miao Fan and Kong Zhen came again.</p><p></p><p>Han Jinlong's eyes brightened. "Have you two found that azure-robed cultivator?"</p><p></p><p>"We have succeeded." Miao Fan and Kong Zhen bowed.</p><p></p><p>"Where is he?" Han Jinlong smiled.</p><p></p><p>"Someone has seen the azure-robed cultivator, saying he was at a restaurant called Xianhe. But Kongzhen and I haven't confirmed it yet, we wanted to report to the Great Lord of the Golden Wheel first," Miao Fan said with a smile.</p><p></p><p>Xianhe restaurant?</p><p></p><p>Han Jinlong slowly stood up and said with a smile, "Well done. Then I shall go and take a look myself."</p><p></p><p>Miao Fan and Kong Zhen trembled, exchanging glances.</p><p></p><p>Shouldn't the azure-robed cultivator come to the main hall to meet the Great Lord of the Golden Wheel? Why would the Great Lord go himself?</p><p></p><p>"Great Lord, if you wish to see him, perhaps Kongzhen and I could notify him to come meet you? If you go in person, it might be a loss of dignity..." Miao Fan said hesitantly.</p><p></p><p>Han Jinlong let out a light laugh and waved his hand. "No need for such formalities. What's the big deal? I just want to take a look at this azure-robed cultivator you speak of. If he is truly one of our human race and possesses such strength, then as the Great Lord, I should humbly receive him."</p><p></p><p>"But what if he is from another race? Hehe, I wouldn't want to startle the snake in the grass."</p><p></p><p>Miao Fan and Kong Zhen immediately understood Han Jinlong's intentions. It's just that... that azure-robed cultivator was truly from the human race, they were certain of the aura they sensed.</p><p></p><p>Han Jinlong glanced at the two of them: "You two are still too green. On this battlefield of gods and demons, the tricks of those other races are not few..."</p><p></p><p>"Alright, you two should go do what you need to do, no need to follow me."</p><p></p><p>With those words, Han Jinlong disappeared.</p><p></p><p>"Yes."</p><p></p><p>Miao Fan and Kong Zhen hurriedly bowed, and after a moment, they stood up and exchanged a glance, simultaneously letting out a sigh.</p><p></p><p>They had actually wanted to follow, but it was clear that the Great Lord of the Golden Wheel did not want them to come along.</p>

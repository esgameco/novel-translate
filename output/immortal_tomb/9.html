        <h1>Chapter 9</h1>
        <div class="content">
            <p>Here is the full English translation of the Chinese excerpt:</p><p></p><p>"Mr. Magistrate?"</p><p></p><p>"What magistrate?"</p><p></p><p>The town guard was a bit confused.</p><p></p><p>The steward glanced at the dazed town guard, then looked at Chen Dadao and said in a low voice, "My lord, let's go out first. The commoners are still waiting for you."</p><p></p><p>Moreover, he dared not linger here, remembering that the demons might still be in this manor, which made him shudder with fear, his whole body covered in goosebumps.</p><p></p><p>Chen Dadao looked at the sixty-seven corpses on the ground, sighed softly, and turned to walk out quickly: "Let's go."</p><p></p><p>Soon, as the manor gates opened, the gaze of the commoners was all drawn to them.</p><p></p><p>Seeing Chen Dadao and the others come out.</p><p></p><p>Chen Dadao looked at the commoners whose eyes were full of curiosity, pondered for a moment, and said in a solemn voice, "I, the magistrate, will not hide anything from all of you, and will tell you directly that all sixty-seven people in the Qian manor have been killed by demons."</p><p></p><p>The air fell silent for a moment...</p><p></p><p>The commoners suddenly became restless, and panic spread throughout the crowd!</p><p></p><p>"Demons, demons!"</p><p></p><p>"The Qian manor has been wiped out!"</p><p></p><p>"What are we going to do? Demons have appeared again, are we all going to die? After the Qian manor, it will be us!"</p><p></p><p>"..."</p><p></p><p>Seeing the scene getting a bit out of control,</p><p></p><p>Chen Dadao sighed inwardly. He knew that telling the truth would definitely cause this kind of reaction, but to let him hide it, he really couldn't do it!</p><p></p><p>The commoners have the right to know the truth!!</p><p></p><p>The steward had thought the magistrate would use a different way of speaking, but he actually directly told the truth!</p><p></p><p>He glanced at the restlessness here, looked worriedly at the hesitant Chen Dadao, and then shouted loudly, "Everyone, be quiet! The magistrate has something to say! Believe in the magistrate!"</p><p></p><p>The clamor gradually subsided, and the commoners looked at Chen Dadao with hope.</p><p></p><p>If it weren't for Chen Dadao being loved and trusted by them, they wouldn't be able to calm down in this life-threatening situation.</p><p></p><p>Chen Dadao pursed his lips and said in a solemn voice, "I, Chen Dadao, have been the magistrate of Moyu Town for five years, and everyone knows what kind of person I am! I hope that from now on, everyone will listen to the arrangements, and I, the magistrate, will do my best to ensure everyone's safety!"</p><p></p><p>The steward echoed, "That's right, at a time like this, what you need to do is obey the magistrate's arrangements!"</p><p></p><p>The commoners were silent for a moment, but soon some people waved their arms and shouted,</p><p></p><p>"Yes! The Magistrate could have chosen not to tell us the truth! But the Magistrate did tell us! The Magistrate will never be wrong!"</p><p></p><p>"Everyone believes in the Magistrate! He will definitely protect our safety!"</p><p></p><p>"What do demons matter? As long as we are united, we have nothing to fear!"</p><p></p><p>"Yes, believe in the Magistrate!"</p><p></p><p>"Believe in the Magistrate!"</p><p></p><p>The commoners were infected, and one after another they raised their arms and shouted.</p><p></p><p>...</p><p></p><p>Half an incense stick later, the commoners had all returned to their homes.</p><p></p><p>"Sigh."</p><p></p><p>Chen Dadao looked at the finally quiet place, shook his head and sighed, then looked at the town guard and ordered, "Seal the Qian manor and don't bother with it for now, all the town guards must patrol the entire town without slacking off!"</p><p></p><p>"Yes." The town guard bowed.</p><p></p><p>Chen Dadao recalled the previous scene, his gaze resolute:</p><p></p><p>"Let's go, we're going to find the gentleman... Even if the gentleman wants my life, Chen Dadao, I'll give it to him!!"</p><p></p><p>With that, he strode towards the magistrate's mansion.</p><p></p><p>The steward looked at Chen Dadao's back, his heart warming, the magistrate is truly a good magistrate...</p><p></p><p>"Steward, who is this gentleman exactly?"</p><p></p><p>The town guard turned his gaze and asked the steward.</p><p></p><p>"Don't tell anyone else, just know it in your heart." The steward suddenly said something that left the town guard puzzled.</p><p></p><p>Here is the full English translation of the Chinese excerpt:</p><p></p><p>Immediately after, he saw the butler running towards Chen Dadao, but soon the butler's voice was carried by the wind into his ears, causing his body to tremble and his pupils to suddenly contract!</p><p></p><p>"Immortal."</p><p></p><p>.........</p><p></p><p>"Haha, Immortal? Brother Tong, this is the first time my junior has returned to the mundane world since entering the immortal cultivation realm. I never expected even us cultivators at the Qi Refining stage to be called immortals. How amusing!"</p><p></p><p>A flying carpet swiftly soared through the sky, with eleven figures seated upon it. One outer disciple looked at Tong Xin respectfully and smiled.</p><p></p><p>The other nine outer disciples also chuckled.</p><p></p><p>They, at the Qi Refining stage, couldn't even master flying with swords or flying with artifacts, yet they were already being called immortals.</p><p></p><p>"In the eyes of the mundane world, as long as one can perform magical arts and fly, they are considered immortals." Tong Xin nodded expressionlessly. As an esteemed direct disciple, he naturally had to maintain a solemn and imposing demeanor in front of the outer disciples.</p><p></p><p>"You all don't need to make a ruckus. We'll be arriving at Jia Yuan City soon. Earlier, two hundred innocent civilians had already died there, and now the number is unknown."</p><p></p><p>Tong Xin continued calmly.</p><p></p><p>At his words, the ten outer disciples quickly quieted down. They naturally obeyed Tong Xin.</p><p></p><p>"Brother Tong, with you, a Foundation Establishment cultivator, here, those minor demons will surely be terrified out of their wits when they see you!" A female disciple flattered.</p><p></p><p>The others also nodded in admiration as they looked at Tong Xin.</p><p></p><p>A thousand times pierced, but only flattery remains unpierceable!</p><p></p><p>Tong Xin couldn't help but curve his lips in a smile, feeling very pleased. He then said, "My fellow junior brothers and sisters, your praise is undeserved. On this journey, you should focus on properly tempering yourselves against those demons, so that you may advance to the Inner Sect sooner. Wouldn't that be wonderful?"</p><p></p><p>"We will remember Brother Tong's teachings." The disciples responded respectfully with clasped fists.</p><p></p><p>"Haha, good. My fellow junior brothers and sisters, sit tight. Brother is about to increase the speed!"</p><p></p><p>Tong Xin said, flipping his palm to reveal a translucent low-grade spirit stone.</p><p></p><p>He then slapped it into the center of the flying carpet!</p><p></p><p>With a whoosh, the carpet suddenly accelerated!</p><p></p><p>The outer disciples hurriedly supported each other, and under this intense acceleration, one disciple even almost fell off the carpet, his face deathly pale...</p><p></p><p>.........</p><p></p><p>Miao Yu Town.</p><p></p><p>The Town Master's Residence, the backyard.</p><p></p><p>"Town Master, how should we tell the Master...?" </p><p></p><p>Chen Dadao and the butler arrived at the backyard one after the other. The butler asked in a soft voice.</p><p></p><p>"As long as the Master... Ah!"</p><p></p><p>Chen Dadao hadn't finished speaking when he saw a figure quietly sitting in the pavilion, like a ghost.</p><p></p><p>Chen Dadao and the butler exchanged a startled glance, then quickly walked over and bowed before Lu Changsheng.</p><p></p><p>Chen Dadao respectfully said, "Master, it's the hour of the Rat now. I didn't expect you to still be awake..."</p><p></p><p>Lu Changsheng opened his eyes and looked at the unnaturally anxious Chen Dadao without responding.</p><p></p><p>The air was silent.</p><p></p><p>Suddenly, Chen Dadao and the butler knelt down heavily, kowtowing and roaring, "Demons have appeared in the town! Just earlier, an entire household of sixty-seven people was killed! We mortals are truly powerless against these evil creatures. Please, Master, lend us your aid! Anything we have, we can offer to you, even our lives!!"</p><p></p><p>The butler also trembled as he pleaded, "Please, Master, lend us your help... If this continues, more people will die. We... we are truly at our wits' end!"</p><p></p><p>At this moment, the dark mist shrouding Miao Yu Town slightly dispersed, allowing the moonlight to shine through.</p><p></p><p>In the moonlight, Lu Changsheng slowly stood up, his hands behind his back, quietly looking at Chen Dadao.</p><p></p><p>"Some people's lives are already destined. And your life, is it so valuable?"</p>

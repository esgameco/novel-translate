            <p>Here is the full English translation of the Chinese excerpt:</p><p></p><p>The Divine Realm Plaza.</p><p></p><p>The gazes of the countless cultivators from various sects were filled with awe, reverence, and fervor towards the young man in blue robes!</p><p></p><p>The number one expert, the true number one expert of the Divine-Demonic Battlefield!!</p><p></p><p>Although they knew the young man in blue robes possessed the legendary Eternal Life Body, not a single cultivator from the various sects dared to harbor any greed!</p><p></p><p>The ancient saying goes, "Coveting a precious object brings calamity!"</p><p></p><p>But under the awe-inspiring and overwhelming power, this saying was nothing but bullshit!</p><p></p><p>The next moment!</p><p></p><p>The cultivators from the various sects seemed to have a tacit understanding as they knelt down en masse before Lu Changsheng!</p><p></p><p>Jian Wuhuai and the others also seemed to have recovered somewhat, and with their last ounce of strength, they struggled to get up from the ground, kneeling before Lu Changsheng.</p><p></p><p>"We pay our respects to the Venerable Changsheng!!"</p><p></p><p>Their fervent salutation seemed to echo to the ends of the earth!</p><p></p><p>Lu Changsheng stood with his hands behind his back, his gaze sweeping lightly over the cultivators, "Mm."</p><p></p><p>Seeing this, the cultivators heaved a huge sigh of relief in their hearts.</p><p></p><p>The cultivators were also perceptive people, and they exchanged glances with each other, eventually bidding farewell to Lu Changsheng respectfully.</p><p></p><p>"Venerable Changsheng, then we shall take our leave..."</p><p></p><p>However, Lu Changsheng seemed to be deep in thought about something and did not hear them.</p><p></p><p>Thus, the cultivators waited cautiously, not daring to make a sound, lest they disturb Lu Changsheng's contemplation.</p><p></p><p>In this way, the Divine Realm Plaza fell into a strange silence!</p><p></p><p>The young man in blue robes was in deep thought, while the cultivators stood quietly by his side...</p><p></p><p>Until the time it took to drink a cup of tea had passed, Lu Changsheng finally emerged from his contemplation and looked at the cultivators, slightly furrowing his brows:</p><p></p><p>"Still not leaving? Do you want me to see you off?"</p><p></p><p>Misunderstanding! Misunderstanding, Venerable Changsheng!!  We would never dare to ask you to see us off!</p><p></p><p>The cultivators turned pale with fright, their hearts filled with bitterness, but even if they had a hundred times more courage, they certainly wouldn't dare to say anything more.</p><p></p><p>"Yes, yes, yes... Venerable Changsheng, then we shall take our leave. If there is ever anything we can do for you, please just give the order, and we will not hesitate to go through fire and water!"</p><p></p><p>"..."</p><p></p><p>After the clan leaders led their clansmen to bow to Lu Changsheng, they dared not linger and quickly departed.</p><p></p><p>The speed at which the various sects withdrew was remarkably fast, like a torrent rushing out of the Divine Realm Sect under the immense pressure from Lu Changsheng.</p><p></p><p>A moment later, the interior and exterior of the Divine Realm Plaza had become extremely empty compared to before.</p><p></p><p>Of course, the peak experts from the top ten clans had not yet departed!</p><p></p><p>It's not that they didn't want to leave, they were certainly eager to do so as well!</p><p></p><p>It's just that... it's just that their clan leaders were still pathetically bound to the stone pillars, and they couldn't just abandon their clan leaders and run away, could they?</p><p></p><p>But with Lu Changsheng present, they dared not rashly rescue their clan leaders.</p><p></p><p>And so, the high-level members of the major clans were all cautiously looking towards Lu Changsheng... their intentions unspoken.</p><p></p><p>Lu Changsheng's expression was impassive as he lightly waved his sleeve, very gracefully.</p><p></p><p>Immediately afterwards, the ropes binding Bi You, Ao Zhengtian, and the other clan leaders on the stone pillars shattered with a 'clang'.</p><p></p><p>They then fell down from the stone pillars.</p><p></p><p>"Clan leader!"</p><p></p><p>The high-level members of the major clans exclaimed in delight, rushing forward to welcome them, and the holy scions and holy maidens of the clans also hurriedly approached.</p><p></p><p>However, Bi You, Ao Zhengtian, and the other clan leaders hastily waved their hands to stop them, then came before Lu Changsheng, bowing in unison and saying, "Venerable Changsheng, we are deeply grateful for your rescue!"</p><p></p><p>Lu Changsheng glanced at them, then suddenly looked towards Feng Jun, Bai Qianmo, Xuan Shan, and the other holy scions and holy maidens, softly asking, "Wuhuai, who released them?"</p><p></p><p>At these words, whether it was the clan leaders of the Phoenix and White Tiger Clans, or Feng Jun and the other holy maidens and holy scions, as well as all the high-level members of the major clans, their souls trembled, and their bodies swayed, the color draining from their faces!!</p><p></p><p>The human cultivators also had their expressions change slightly, glancing towards Feng Jun and the others.</p><p></p><p>Their hearts filled with bitterness, as earlier, when the Divine Realm Sect had attacked them, they had no choice but to release these holy scions and holy maidens...</p><p></p><p>Jian Wuhuai's expression was slightly twisted, and he said in a hoarse voice, "Venerable Changsheng... this... this..."</p><p></p><p>Jian Wuhuai didn't even know how to explain it.</p><p></p><p>Boom, boom, boom...!</p><p></p><p>At this moment, Feng Jun, Bai Qianmo, Xuan Shan, and the other holy scions and holy maidens suddenly knelt down, prostrating on the ground, their entire bodies trembling!</p><p></p><p>The clan leaders of the Phoenix and other major clans also knelt down, their mouths opening and closing, wanting to say something, but...</p><p></p><p>Here is the full English translation of the Chinese excerpt:</p><p></p><p>How dare I plead for mercy!! </p><p></p><p>Both Bi You and Ao Zhengtian heaved a huge sigh of relief, and after exchanging a glance, they looked at their own Ao Xing and Bi Qiong, their eyes filled with satisfaction.</p><p></p><p>These two good kids, they don't know if it's just luck or what, but they actually didn't provoke the Immortal Lord.</p><p></p><p>This made them very satisfied.</p><p></p><p>At the same time, Bi You and Ao Zhengtian's eyes also held a hint of pity as they looked at the Holy Scions and Holy Maidens like Feng Jun.</p><p></p><p>These juniors, it's really a pity.</p><p></p><p>Today, they are likely doomed.</p><p></p><p>Even if the Immortal Lord killed them, the Clan Lords of the Phoenix Clan and other major clans probably wouldn't dare to make a sound.</p><p></p><p>"You handle it as you see fit."</p><p></p><p>Lu Changsheng looked at Jian Wuhuai meaningfully, then pointed to restore the injuries of the human race's people, and finally looked up at the sky and slowly disappeared.</p><p></p><p>Feeling the injuries in their bodies rapidly healing, the people of the human race were once again shocked!</p><p></p><p>Jian Wuhuai was shocked, then stunned, staring at the spot where Lu Changsheng had disappeared, his face bitter.</p><p></p><p>The Immortal Lord's meaning was very clear - if you do wrong, you must pay the price, and previously the Immortal Lord had said that he would kill them in front of these major clan lords, which was probably not a joke.</p><p></p><p>But a real decision made at the time.</p><p></p><p>A figure like the Immortal Lord should be one who says what he means.</p><p></p><p>Jian Wuhuai pursed his lips and looked at the major clan lords of the Phoenix Clan, hesitating to speak.</p><p></p><p>Although the human race is now ranked first among the tribes, it is ultimately relying on the glory of the Immortal Lord.</p><p></p><p>Their human race, before completely refining that batch of Liuli Hearts, their foundation is still a bit thin.</p><p></p><p>Jiang Wuxin and the others also had conflicted expressions, able to empathize with Jian Wuhuai's current state of mind.</p><p></p><p>"Sigh."</p><p></p><p>Suddenly, the Phoenix Clan Lord sighed, painfully looking at Feng Jun, then slowly stood up and said in a low voice:</p><p></p><p>"Sword Venerable, just do as the Immortal Lord wishes, return to your clan!!"</p><p></p><p>After saying that, she led the high-ranking members with slightly changed expressions to leave.</p><p></p><p>The White Tiger Clan and other major clans also steeled their hearts and were about to lead their own clan members to leave.</p><p></p><p>They didn't even dare to look at Feng Jun and the others again!</p><p></p><p>"Father!"</p><p>"Clan Lord!"</p><p></p><p>Feng Jun and the others called out in pale faces.</p><p></p><p>The Phoenix Clan and other major clan lords only paused for a moment, then sighed and forcibly led their own clan members to leave.</p><p></p><p>Only a bitter voice transmission echoed in Feng Jun and the others' minds.</p><p></p><p>"Accept your fate, the Immortal Lord is such an unparalleled figure, the entire Divine-Demon Battlefield's myriad tribes combined... can't provoke him."</p><p></p><p>Feng Jun, Bai Qianmo, Xuan Shan and other major clan Holy Scions were stunned for a moment, then suddenly tears sprang from their eyes.</p><p></p><p>But it seems that regret has come too late.</p><p></p><p>Jian Wuhuai's eyes narrowed slightly, slowly raising his long sword, but there was a hint of solemnity and worry in his heart...</p><p></p><p>Personally slaying these major clan's Holy Scions and Holy Maidens, no matter how you look at it, those major clans will have estrangement with his human race in the future...</p><p></p><p>And most importantly, he had a premonition that the Immortal Lord would not stay in the Divine-Demon Battlefield forever...</p><p></p><p>"Enough with the crying and whining, it's annoying. Since my mood is good today, Wuhuai, just cut off their cultivation of a hundred million years, then let the major clan lords take them back to reflect."</p><p></p><p>Suddenly, a magnetic voice descended from the sky, resounding through this world.</p><p></p><p>And the content of these words was full of redemption, abruptly pulling Feng Jun and the others back from the brink of despair!</p><p></p><p>Jian Wuhuai's sword almost couldn't be restrained, and he felt a surge of relief in his heart.</p><p></p><p>As for Feng Jun and the others, they transformed their despair into wild joy, standing there dumbly with snot and tears, stupidly grinning.</p><p></p><p>Who would understand the feeling of being pulled back and forth at the gates of the underworld...</p><p></p><p>As for the distant Phoenix Clan and other major clan lords, after a moment of daze, their bodies seemed to lose strength, after all, those were their own children. Their eyes reddened as they bowed deeply to the sky.</p><p></p><p>They opened their mouths wanting to say something, but remained silent for a long time.</p><p></p><p>They were deeply grateful, but also had an overwhelming desire!</p><p></p><p>This was the true supreme being, possessing the power to control the lives of others, and the most precious lives of others, in the eyes of the supreme being, were like the lives of ants, life and death... all depended on mood.</p><p></p><p>If he wants you to live, you live.</p><p></p><p>Otherwise, you die!</p><p></p><p>...</p><p></p><p>For the fastest updates of flawless novels, please visit www.feixs.com</p><p></p><p>For mobile access: https://m.feixs.com/chapter-45751-38225522</p>

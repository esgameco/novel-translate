        <h1>Chapter 235</h1>
        <div class="content">
            <p>Here is the full English translation of the Chinese excerpt:</p><p></p><p>"Wah wah wah, Doctor Lu!"</p><p></p><p>"Oh, Doctor Lu has come out today!"</p><p></p><p>"Hello, Doctor Lu! Doctor Lu, the oil cakes are still hot, would you like to have some?"</p><p></p><p>"Doctor Lu, we're really sorry, we haven't been sick lately. When I go back, I'll take a cold shower, hoping I'll be lucky enough to catch a cold so I can come visit your clinic!"</p><p></p><p>Lu Changsheng: "......"</p><p></p><p>On the street, Lu Changsheng was surrounded by a group of elderly and women in the corner of the wall. He looked at the sincere enthusiasm and the rare expressions on their faces, and at the various oil cakes and buns being handed to him, and he was at a loss for words.</p><p></p><p>He admitted that he was powerless against these ordinary people.</p><p></p><p>All along, he had never actively made a move against ordinary people.</p><p></p><p>In his view, those who had the ability to surround him in the corner were just these kind old men and aunties.</p><p></p><p>If it were Peng Fang, Zuo Cou Shan and those familiar with Lu Changsheng, they would have gasped in shock and had their jaws dropped.</p><p></p><p>They would have thought secretly: Do you know who you're surrounding? The sect master is one who kills without hesitation, well, you are just insignificant ants.</p><p></p><p>"Everyone, I'm just out for a walk. If you do this, how can I dare to come out of the clinic next time?" Lu Changsheng sighed and said softly.</p><p></p><p>Luo Gu heard this, his eyes flickered, and he hurriedly pushed the crowd away with difficulty: "Go away, go away! Who dares to block Doctor Lu!!"</p><p></p><p>Now he was still in his prime, even more vigorous than before, all thanks to Doctor Lu!</p><p></p><p>He originally thought that after drinking that medicine, he could only maintain for a while, but according to his careful observation, it seemed to be permanent.</p><p></p><p>This made him both excited and a little conflicted, the conflict being that the money he earned from selling buns might be squandered.</p><p></p><p>But money is of no use, you can't bring it with you when you're born or take it with you when you die, and since he's alone, it's better to just live for the moment and get drunk.</p><p></p><p>Luo Gu remembered that the medicinal materials given by Doctor Lu could be brewed one more time, and he would drink it again then, as a man, the stronger the better.</p><p></p><p>The crowd also realized that their behavior was inappropriate, and quickly gave an apologetic smile to Lu Changsheng, bowed and walked away, but they started to criticize Luo Gu:</p><p></p><p>"Tsk, old Luo, you're the only one who knows how to flatter Doctor Lu, aren't you? Don't think we don't know what benefits you've gotten from Doctor Lu!"</p><p></p><p>"We won't expose you, we'll leave you some face."</p><p></p><p>"Hmph, give you a look and see how you feel."</p><p></p><p>"You... you..." Luo Gu's face flushed red, his finger pointing at the quickly departing crowd, almost furious.</p><p></p><p>Could it be that everyone knows he's taking medicine? </p><p></p><p>Damn it, how did they find out?</p><p></p><p>But apart from Doctor Lu, no one else knows, could it be that Doctor Lu told them?</p><p></p><p>Thinking of this, Luo Gu looked at Lu Changsheng with a aggrieved expression: "Doctor Lu... where should this old man put his face in the future?"</p><p></p><p>"As a doctor, I have the obligation to keep the patient's condition confidential," Lu Changsheng said slowly, glancing at him, and then stepped away from the corner.</p><p></p><p>Hearing this, Luo Gu's expression changed slightly, realizing that he had misunderstood Doctor Lu. In this Yanyu Town, anyone could offend, but he couldn't offend Doctor Lu, offending Doctor Lu is no different from offending the god of death.</p><p></p><p>So he hurriedly followed, almost crying, "Doctor Lu, I didn't mean that... in the future, please don't refuse to treat me, if this old man gets sick in the future, how can I live?"</p><p></p><p>Lu Changsheng took a light breath and rubbed his temples: "You go sell your buns quickly, if you keep following me and bothering me..."</p><p></p><p>"Hot, freshly steamed buns!" </p><p></p><p>In an instant, Luo Gu rushed to the stall and started shouting earnestly, but his eyes kept glancing towards Lu Changsheng.</p><p></p><p>Seeing this, Lu Changsheng pursed his lips and left, hands behind his back.</p><p></p><p>Here is the full English translation of the excerpt from the Chinese novel:</p><p></p><p>However, in his heart, he sighed, this Luo Gu was truly an old child. As an ordinary person, he was already at an age where he was about to be buried, yet his mentality was still so optimistic, his spirit and vitality better than many young people.</p><p></p><p>Unlike some people, who were still young but had already grown old.</p><p></p><p>.........</p><p></p><p>Nine days later.</p><p></p><p>Su Lianyi returned to the Upper Clarity Palace.</p><p></p><p>The moment she returned, she headed towards the back mountain.</p><p></p><p>"Lianyi, this time you went out, you were actually injured." Yun Mei frowned as she looked at the kneeling Su Lianyi.</p><p></p><p>Su Lianyi's eyes were red and pitiful as she replied, "Master, this time the Xu Shidi who went out with me... died."</p><p></p><p>Yun Mei was not surprised. She asked, "Who did this?"</p><p></p><p>Su Lianyi shook her head sadly, "I don't know, the assailant was mysterious, with powerful cultivation. It seems they have a grudge against our Upper Clarity Palace... That person ambushed us in secret. If not for Xu Shidi sacrificing herself to protect me, I fear I would never have seen you again, Master."</p><p></p><p>A grudge?</p><p></p><p>Yun Mei's brow furrowed slightly.</p><p></p><p>This time Su Lianyi and Xu Jiao went out randomly, except for her and some elders, no one else knew about it. How could their whereabouts have been leaked and they were attacked?</p><p></p><p>Could it be that there are hidden agents from other sects among the elders of our Upper Clarity Palace?</p><p></p><p>"Lianyi, you go and rest first. Xu Jiao will not have died in vain, I must find out which sect's despicable hand did this!" Yun Mei said impassively.</p><p></p><p>One of her own disciples was killed by another sect, and the Sage Maiden almost perished as well. This grievance must be settled.</p><p></p><p>"I hope Master can help Xu Jiao Shidi get justice!! Otherwise, Lianyi may live the rest of her life in guilt!" Su Lianyi kowtowed and said bitterly.</p><p></p><p>After saying that, she fainted from excessive grief.</p><p></p><p>Yun Mei waved her sleeve, lifting her up, looking at the agonized and unconscious Su Lianyi, she sighed, "Lianyi, as the Sage Maiden, your heart must be stronger. Why are you like this? You are still too kind-hearted. In the cultivation world, being too kind-hearted, you will eventually suffer greatly."</p><p></p><p>"Don't worry, I will definitely find the sect that secretly harmed you and Xu Jiao."</p><p></p><p>"Before that, the hidden agents in the palace still need to be rooted out and eliminated..."</p><p></p><p>She then said faintly into the void, "All elders, gather in the Assembly Hall."</p><p></p><p>.........</p><p></p><p>"Haha, impressive!" </p><p></p><p>In the medical hall, Tong Xin closed the medical book, exclaiming in admiration as he looked at Xiao Tong, then came before Lu Changsheng respectfully, "Sir, Xiao Tong has memorized the appearance and effects of all the medicinal materials without missing a single one."</p><p></p><p>Lu Changsheng nodded slightly, he looked at Xiao Tong.</p><p></p><p>Xiao Tong hurriedly bowed when she saw the master looking at her.</p><p></p><p>Lu Changsheng flipped his hand, and another thick book flew over.</p><p></p><p>Xiao Tong caught it and waited for the instructions.</p><p></p><p>"This is a true medical book, containing various medical principles. Memorize it thoroughly within a month," Lu Changsheng said.</p><p></p><p>"Yes, master," Xiao Tong responded respectfully.</p><p></p><p>Lu Changsheng nodded lightly and said, "From now on, if anyone in the village comes to see a doctor, you will diagnose them first."</p><p></p><p>Xiao Tong was startled, her heart began to get nervous, after all, she was taking on this responsibility so quickly, and she wasn't fully prepared in her heart.</p><p></p><p>"Is it difficult?" Lu Changsheng frowned.</p><p></p><p>Xiao Tong trembled inwardly, bowing, "No, it's not difficult."</p><p></p><p>"Medical skills are not just about theoretical knowledge, but also require countless practical experiences to refine," Lu Changsheng said softly, "If there are not many patients in Yanyu Village, I will take you to other towns to find patients."</p><p></p><p>"Yes, master," Xiao Tong deeply bowed.</p><p></p><p>Tong Xin, standing aside, felt his scalp tingling. Xiao Tong was still a child, yet the master was being so strict with her.</p><p></p><p>However, by this point, even the slowest person could understand that the master was trying to cultivate a doctor for Yanyu Village in advance.</p><p></p><p>Thinking back to the previous events, he suddenly realized why Xiao Tong was no longer willing to cultivate.</p>

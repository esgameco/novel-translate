        <div class="content">
            <p>Here is the full English translation of the Chinese excerpt:</p><p></p><p>"Whoever moves, whoever dies. .•°¤*(¯`★´¯)*¤° 69SHU.CoM °¤*(¯´★`¯)*¤°•."</p><p></p><p>As the words fell, the first layer fell into an eerie silence!</p><p></p><p>The armies of the various tribes were first puzzled for a moment, then looked towards the source of the voice.</p><p></p><p>Soon, countless gazes converged on the figure in blue!</p><p></p><p>Fang Yin, Mo Liang Qiu, and the others were frightened, not knowing what tricks Senior Lu would pull this time.</p><p></p><p>Throughout their journey, this Senior Lu Changsheng would occasionally startle them.</p><p></p><p>And the non-human tribes that had entered this Seven-Colored Crystal Tower were all looking at Lu Changsheng with suspicion...</p><p></p><p>Because earlier in the outside world, they had witnessed this person triggering the anomaly of the Sensing Array.</p><p></p><p>Now, hearing his arrogant words, it was hard for them not to make associations.</p><p></p><p>The next moment, a thunderous laughter echoed through the entire layer:</p><p></p><p>"Hahaha, I'm laughing to death, has the human race become so arrogant now?"</p><p></p><p>"Whoever moves, whoever dies? Who does he think he is?"</p><p></p><p>"In my opinion, the human race has gone mad, this is a one-time offense against all races! They really have guts!"</p><p></p><p>"Hey, you human, what the hell are you barking about?"</p><p></p><p>"Since the humans are looking for death, why don't we all wipe out this human tribe first?"</p><p></p><p>"......"</p><p></p><p>Fang Yin and the others turned deathly pale, their bodies trembling!</p><p></p><p>This situation was something they had never anticipated.</p><p></p><p>In a silent moment, the human race had become the target of all.</p><p></p><p>This scene greatly lifted Youshen's mood, and the gloom he had felt earlier from losing a clansman had dissipated considerably.</p><p></p><p>He sneered at the human who had spoken such arrogant words!</p><p></p><p>Even if the human tribe before them were to be completely annihilated today, it would not extinguish the fury of the myriad tribes.</p><p></p><p>The words spoken earlier had even insulted those great tribes on the Myriad Tribe Ranking.</p><p></p><p>Youshen had already foreseen the scene of the human race being wiped out after the Seven-Colored Crystal Tower was over.</p><p></p><p>"Boom, boom, boom, boom, boom, boom, boom, boom, boom..."</p><p></p><p>Suddenly, a series of continuous explosions rang out!</p><p></p><p>Accompanied by the agonizing screams of many non-humans who were startled!</p><p></p><p>Some of the clansmen next to the non-humans exploded without any warning, their blood splattering everywhere!</p><p></p><p>...</p><p></p><p>As the terrifying explosions gradually subsided, the first layer of the Seven-Colored Crystal Tower fell into an eerie silence!</p><p></p><p>The pungent smell of blood in the air deeply unsettled the nerves of all the non-humans!</p><p></p><p>What...happened?</p><p></p><p>This scene was exactly the same as the mysterious explosion of the Youshen Tribe's powerhouse earlier.</p><p></p><p>But this time, it was on a massive scale, and in the previous explosions, thousands of non-human members had been killed in total!!</p><p></p><p>At this moment, the members of all the tribes were trembling with fear!</p><p></p><p>Those with keen perception realized that the non-humans who had just been exploded were the ones who had mocked earlier...</p><p></p><p>Then, Lu Changsheng said indifferently, "This is just a warning. Whoever dares to speak another word or even move a step, will meet the same fate."</p><p></p><p>What?!</p><p></p><p>Was it him who did this?</p><p></p><p>Impossible!</p><p></p><p>Countless horrified gazes were fixed on Lu Changsheng, filled with disbelief!</p><p></p><p>Even the members of the Heavenly God Tribe, the Devouring Beast Tribe, and the Dragon Tribe had their pupils constricted as they stared at Lu Changsheng!</p><p></p><p>Youshen's eyes flickered as he glared coldly at Lu Changsheng, "Hmph, you human bastard, what are you..."</p><p></p><p>Boom!</p><p></p><p>Before he could finish, he suddenly exploded into a mist of blood!</p><p></p><p>The Holy Son of the Youshen Tribe, deceased.</p><p></p><p>"Holy Son..."</p><p></p><p>"The..."</p><p></p><p>Boom, boom, boom, boom...</p><p></p><p>ɯo</p><p></p><p>Here is the full English translation of the Chinese excerpt:</p><p></p><p>The remaining seven members of the Youshe Clan also burst into a bloody mist, following the Youshe Clan's Holy Son...</p><p></p><p>Deathly silence in the space!</p><p></p><p>The pupils of all the clan members contracted into needle-like shapes, their bodies trembling!</p><p></p><p>If they had not believed it before, they had no choice but to believe it now!</p><p></p><p>Because the Youshe Clan's Holy Son and the remaining seven members of the Youshe Clan had just died right before their eyes...</p><p></p><p>For a moment, all the clan members were as silent as cicadas in the cold!</p><p></p><p>They fearfully looked at the young man in blue robes from the Human Clan!</p><p></p><p>Why... why would such a powerful expert enter the Seven-colored Crystal Tower? He must be a super expert in the Divine Seclusion Realm!</p><p></p><p>Even in the Divine Seclusion Realm, he would not be weak!</p><p></p><p>To them, this was a devastating blow.</p><p></p><p>As for the various clan teams that entered the Seven-colored Crystal Tower after the Human Clan, they suddenly understood!</p><p></p><p>No wonder... no wonder when this person entered the Sensing Barrier before, the Sensing Barrier had reacted strangely.</p><p></p><p>Now it made sense!</p><p></p><p>It's just that, why didn't the Sensing Barrier eliminate this person...</p><p></p><p>The Heavenly God Clan, the Devouring Beast Clan, the Dragon Clan, and other major clans were chilled to the bone at this moment...</p><p></p><p>If it were an ordinary Divine Seclusion Realm, with their foundations, they would not be afraid at all!</p><p></p><p>It's just that this person gave them the feeling that he was not an ordinary Divine Seclusion Realm expert!</p><p></p><p>They now really wanted to tell Lu Changsheng, "Stop, when the Seven-colored Crystal Tower is over, your Human Clan will be doomed."</p><p></p><p>But with the precedent of so many other races exploding, they dared not.</p><p></p><p>The Human Clan... well done.</p><p></p><p>They didn't know what means the Human Clan used to sneak into this Seven-colored Crystal Tower, but they would definitely pay a heavy price afterwards!</p><p></p><p>There was one more thing that puzzled them...</p><p></p><p>Since the Human Clan has a Divine Seclusion expert sneaking in, wouldn't it be better to quietly seize the Crystal Hearts?</p><p></p><p>With their cultivation in the Divine Seclusion Realm, as long as they don't act brazenly, the number of Crystal Hearts they can seize will definitely be more than in previous sessions.</p><p></p><p>Why provoke all the races again?</p><p></p><p>...</p><p></p><p>Lu Changsheng saw that all the clans had quieted down, and he said sideways, "You all, go and collect the Crystal Hearts."</p><p></p><p>Fang Yin and Mo Liangshou, etc. snapped out of their daze, and replied dumbly, "Yes... yes."</p><p></p><p>At this moment, their hearts were filled not with joy, but with endless chill...</p><p></p><p>They didn't dare to imagine what kind of fate the Human Clan would suffer when the Seven-colored Crystal Tower ended.</p><p></p><p>Lu Changsheng continued, "Collect all the Crystal Hearts, don't leave a single one."</p><p></p><p>Fang Yin and the others' faces changed drastically!</p><p></p><p>The members of the various clans also looked at Lu Changsheng with difficulty, disbelief written all over their faces!</p><p></p><p>Audacious to the extreme...</p><p></p><p>"Yes..."</p><p></p><p>Fang Yin and the others bowed slightly to Lu Changsheng, then turned and scattered quickly!</p><p></p><p>At this point, they no longer cared about too much. </p><p></p><p>What they needed to do now was to obey Senior Lu's order!</p><p></p><p>Well... since the Human Clan has been suppressed for too long, then they might as well go crazy with Senior Lu before the Human Clan is annihilated!</p><p></p><p>The members of the various clans stood stiffly in place, looking at the young man in blue robes before them.</p><p></p><p>This young man, standing with his hands behind his back, was suppressing them. He was the absolute ruler in the Seven-colored Crystal Tower at this moment!</p><p></p><p>The Human Clan will seize all the Crystal Hearts of this session of the Seven-colored Crystal Tower, and they can safely return to the Human Clan within the rules.</p><p></p><p>Not to mention anything else, even if the Human Clan is annihilated afterwards, they will have a reputation.</p><p></p><p>This time, the Human Clan has really dealt a heavy blow to the various clans!</p><p></p><p>Lu Changsheng swept a cold glance over the various clans, turned indifferently, and walked towards the depths of the Seven-colored Crystal Tower, with only his magnetic voice lingering.</p><p></p><p>"Those who don't want to die, just stand still."</p>

        <h1>Chapter 532</h1>
        <div class="content">
            <p>Here is the full English translation of the Chinese excerpt:</p><p></p><p>Han Yue snapped out of his daze and glanced at his still stunned parents.</p><p></p><p>Han Tie and Wu Cuilan also regained their senses and looked at Han Yue.</p><p></p><p>Han Yue instantly understood the meaning in his parents' eyes, and his heart felt slightly relieved. He then respectfully said:</p><p></p><p>"Thank you, Lord Zhen, for your concern. However, Han Yue is not tired or in a hurry. The ten-li journey is just the right distance for Han Yue to exercise his body..."</p><p></p><p>Cao Yulong was taken aback, and Huang Yulang and the others were also stunned, then they looked at Han Yue with disbelief!</p><p></p><p>Rejected?</p><p></p><p>This half-grown child, Han Yue...</p><p></p><p>Did he know what he had just rejected?</p><p></p><p>That was a house in Jixing Town!</p><p></p><p>A house in Jixing Town was something that countless commoners outside the town could only strive for their entire lives, and might still not be able to obtain!</p><p></p><p>And the house bestowed by the Lord was no ordinary house, how could it be compared to that?</p><p></p><p>Ye Xiaoxiao and Xiao Fan looked at Han Yue anxiously, wishing they could speak up and accept it on his behalf!</p><p></p><p>Though Han Yue was bowing, his small figure still appeared somewhat upright.</p><p></p><p>Han Yue knew what he had rejected.</p><p></p><p>A house in Jixing Town.</p><p></p><p>But Han Yue knew that one should not receive unearned rewards.</p><p></p><p>His teacher had said, everything must be earned through one's own efforts, only what one obtains by oneself is truly one's own.</p><p></p><p>There is no one in the world who would help oneself without reason.</p><p></p><p>If he were to accept the house bestowed by the Lord without any merit, Han Yue knew that he and his parents might not be able to live there at ease.</p><p></p><p>How could one eat a windfall with a peaceful mind?</p><p></p><p>"Han Yue, are you sure about this?" Cao Yulong asked solemnly.</p><p></p><p>But anyone could see that Cao Yulong's gaze had changed, now filled with admiration.</p><p></p><p>Huang Yulang and the others also looked at Han Yue and his parents with admiration.</p><p></p><p>This is true poverty of the body but not of the spirit...</p><p></p><p>Perhaps some would consider this as affectation, false high-mindedness, to reject the wealth presented before them would be foolish, utterly foolish!</p><p></p><p>But Cao Yulong and the others could clearly see that Han Yue's family had not a hint of pretense, and after rejecting the house, they showed no reluctance or discontent.</p><p></p><p>"Thank you, Lord Zhen, Han Yue is grateful." Han Yue deeply bowed.</p><p></p><p>Cao Yulong looked at Han Yue for a moment, then nodded and said, "Good! Han Yue, the Lord has kept this house for you. Whenever you feel ready, come to the Lord's manor and claim it."</p><p></p><p>Before Han Yue could speak, Cao Yulong raised his hand and continued, "Don't refuse again. The Lord can assure you that the house is given to you without any other ulterior motives."</p><p></p><p>Since Cao Yulong had said so, Han Yue naturally did not dare to say anything else, and could only bow and reply, "Yes, Han Yue understands."</p><p></p><p>"Haha, good." Cao Yulong laughed heartily, then looked at his own child, his gaze filled with disappointment, but he still led him back towards the town.</p><p></p><p>Cao Boyu knew he had disappointed his father, and did not dare to speak, only feeling sorrow, discontent, dejection, and even self-doubt in his heart.</p><p></p><p>He, the son of the Lord, was utterly useless.</p><p></p><p>Huang Yulang and the others also nodded slightly towards Han Yue's family and returned to the town. </p><p></p><p>Ye Xiaoxiao and Xiao Fan made a funny face at Han Yue, then ran back to the town, as it was already mealtime and they were quite hungry.</p><p></p><p>"Father, Mother," Han Yue suddenly lowered his head, his tone somewhat melancholic.</p><p></p><p>"Hmm?" Han Tie and Wu Cuilan exchanged a glance, each taking one of Han Yue's arms, their expressions puzzled.</p><p></p><p>"Father, Mother, is Tie'er really so foolish, to reject the Lord's house? You could have lived in a good house, and I... I..."</p><p></p><p>Han Yue said this while covering his face with his hand, starting to sob.</p><p></p><p>Han Tie and Wu Cuilan's hearts ached. They squatted down, patting his head and comforting him with a smile:</p><p></p><p>"No, Tie'er, you did well. Your father and mother are proud of you. We believe that in the future, we can live in a good house through our own efforts!"</p><p></p><p>"It is we, your parents, who have let you down..."</p><p></p><p>Suddenly, the sound of someone eating noodles rang out.</p><p></p><p>Huh?</p><p></p><p>This immediately pulled the three of them out of the sorrowful atmosphere.</p><p></p><p>They looked over and saw that Luchang Sheng had somehow arrived, standing before them, holding a steaming bowl of noodles in his hands.</p><p></p><p>Here is the full English translation of the Chinese excerpt:</p><p></p><p>The steaming scallion noodles.</p><p></p><p>"Sir! Mr. Lü!"</p><p></p><p>Han Yue and his parents hurriedly stood up and bowed in greeting.</p><p></p><p>Glug glug~</p><p></p><p>Lü Changsheng took a sip of the noodle soup, then extended a gold coin, "Here, take this to buy a house in the town."</p><p></p><p>The three of them looked at the glittering gold coin in the sunlight, swallowing hard, eyes wide! </p><p></p><p>They had never seen a gold coin before!</p><p></p><p>Is this the legendary gold coin?</p><p></p><p>Soon, the three of them trembled and bowed their heads even lower.</p><p></p><p>"Sir, but you previously said... Han Yue doesn't deserve it!"</p><p></p><p>Han Yue said with difficulty.</p><p></p><p>"What are you thinking? Do you think I'm just giving it to you for free? In the future when you earn money, you'll have to pay it back, with interest."</p><p></p><p>Lü Changsheng said indifferently.</p><p></p><p>"Sir..."</p><p></p><p>Before Han Yue could finish, Lü Changsheng frowned and said, "My hand is getting tired."</p><p></p><p>Han Yue flinched and carefully took the gold coin, assuring, "Sir, I will definitely pay you back when I earn money in the future!"</p><p></p><p>Lü Changsheng: "With interest."</p><p></p><p>Han Yue: "Yes, yes, with interest, sir, don't worry!"</p><p></p><p>The three of them bowed deeply, and after a while when no more sound came, they looked up to find the space in front of them empty.</p><p></p><p>Lü Changsheng had disappeared again.</p><p></p><p>"Iron Egg, in the future you must filially respect Mr. Lü even more than your own parents, understand?!"</p><p></p><p>Han Tie sternly said.</p><p></p><p>Han Yue looked at the gold coin in his hand and silently nodded.</p><p></p><p>"Mr. Lü has been so good to Iron Egg, and he's capable too, our Iron Egg has really found the right person, this is a great blessing..." Wu Cuilan said with reddened eyes.</p><p></p><p>In fact, just one gold coin would already be considered a life-changing event for their family.</p><p></p><p>Han Tie suddenly snatched the gold coin from Han Yue's hand and headed towards the town!</p><p></p><p>Han Yue was stunned, quickly chasing after him, "Father, what are you doing?"</p><p></p><p>"Hmph, didn't you hear what Mr. Lü just said? Of course we're going to buy a house!!" Han Tie said loudly.</p><p></p><p>"Father, are you really going to buy it? But the gold coin is..."</p><p></p><p>"Don't dawdle, when you earn money in the future, you can pay him back with interest!"</p><p></p><p>"Huh? Mother, won't you persuade Father?"</p><p></p><p>"Silly boy, we can't accept the house the Lord of the Town gave, but Mr. Lü is your teacher, how could he harm you? In the future when we earn money, we'll pay Mr. Lü back."</p><p></p><p>"Huh?"</p><p></p><p>"Ahem, yes, your father and I have toiled for half a lifetime, and now thanks to you, living in a big house, what's wrong with that?"</p><p></p><p>"Okay... okay, Iron Egg will work hard."</p><p></p><p>In the end, Han Yue didn't say anything more, he knew that his parents actually didn't want him to run back and forth for ten miles every day.</p><p></p><p>......</p><p></p><p>"The fish soup is ready!"</p><p></p><p>In Old Xu's noodle shop, Old Xu carried the cooked fish and walked quickly out of the kitchen, smiling.</p><p></p><p>Old Xu placed it on the table where Lü Changsheng was sitting, and said with a smile, "Mr. Lü, please try it!"</p><p></p><p>Lü Changsheng picked up the crescent-shaped meat from the fish gills and took a light sip, then smiled and said, "Not bad."</p><p></p><p>"Haha, that's great!" Old Xu was immediately satisfied and was about to go back to the kitchen.</p><p></p><p>But Lü Changsheng invited, </p><p></p><p>"Old Xu, there's so much fish meat, why don't you sit down and eat with me?"</p><p></p><p>Old Xu was delighted, not being coy, and rubbed his hands as he sat down.</p><p></p><p>Seeing this, the other few customers in the noodle shop also swallowed hard, their peripheral vision frantically glancing towards Lü Changsheng's table.</p><p></p><p>What a fat and delicious big fish, how did Mr. Lü catch it?</p><p></p><p>And such a big plate, can Mr. Lü and Old Xu finish it?</p><p></p><p>Glug.</p><p></p><p>Hearing the sound of swallowing, Lü Changsheng raised his eyebrows slightly and said with a faint smile, "You can take bowls and serve yourselves."</p><p></p><p>Immediately, the customers in the noodle shop had a gleam in their eyes, picking up their bowls and bouncing over like they had springs attached.</p><p></p><p>"Thank you, Mr. Lü!!"</p><p>"Mr. Lü, the fish you caught is really big!!"</p><p>"..."</p><p></p><p>Hearing this, the furrow between Lü Changsheng's brows relaxed.</p>

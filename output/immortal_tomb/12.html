        <h1>Chapter 12</h1>
        <div class="content">
            <p>Here is my translation of the Chinese excerpt:</p><p></p><p>Boom, boom, boom!</p><p></p><p>In the quiet of the night, the southwest corner of Jiayuan City was erupting with thunderous sounds!</p><p></p><p>All the citizens of the city were cowering in their homes, shivering in fear!</p><p></p><p>These massive explosions were not something that could be caused by human hands!</p><p></p><p>At the same time, in the southwest corner. </p><p></p><p>Tongxin's face looked extremely grim, his clothes a bit tattered, and ten outer sect disciples were lying scattered behind him.</p><p></p><p>Their bodies were covered in fresh blood, exhaling more than inhaling.</p><p></p><p>In just a moment, they had been blasted into critical condition by three black-tongued demons, teetering on the edge of death.</p><p></p><p>This was the immense gap between the power of Qi Refining and Foundation Establishment cultivators - like an unbridgeable chasm!</p><p></p><p>"Can you all still hold on?" </p><p></p><p>Tongxin's gaze focused on the three black-tongued demons, tilting his head slightly and asking in a solemn voice.</p><p></p><p>No one responded - the disciples were nearly unconscious, perhaps not even hearing his words.</p><p></p><p>"Haha, now it's your turn... it's been a while since I've had the blood of a cultivator, that nourishing elixir."</p><p></p><p>The lead black-tongued demon, seeing the conflicted look on Tongxin's face, mocked him. </p><p></p><p>He could tell that the Foundation Establishment disciple was struggling, wanting to flee but unwilling to abandon the Qi Refining disciples here.</p><p></p><p>And this was precisely why they had not directly killed the disciples - to bind this Foundation Establishment disciple!</p><p></p><p>"Tong... Tong senior brother... you should... you should go, we're... we're beyond saving..."</p><p></p><p>At this time, one of the outer sect disciples regained some lucidity, his neck veins bulging as he roared with all his might.</p><p></p><p>At his shout, the other disciples also became slightly more alert, all silent but their expressions filled with resentment, despair, and fear of death.</p><p></p><p>Hearing this, Tongxin became even more unwilling to leave. His brow furrowed for a moment before he took a deep breath, as if making a momentous decision.</p><p></p><p>In his hand appeared a faint golden talisman!</p><p></p><p>This was the talisman his master had bestowed upon him on the day he became a direct disciple, a treasure to save his life.</p><p></p><p>They say it contained the full force of a Golden Core cultivator's attack, and more importantly, it held deep sentimental value as a memento from his master's master.</p><p></p><p>"Hm? What is that in his hand?"</p><p></p><p>The three black-tongued demons were startled, sensing an awe-inspiring power from the talisman Tongxin held.</p><p></p><p>"Quick, eliminate him! Things will get complicated if we delay!"</p><p></p><p>With a fierce cry, the three black-tongued demons rushed towards Tongxin.</p><p></p><p>Seeing this, Tongxin looked at the talisman in his hand with a fleeting expression of tenderness and regret, which then hardened into determination. He flicked his finger, infusing spiritual power into it, and then flung it forcefully at the three demons.</p><p></p><p>The talisman tore through the air, suddenly shattering into fragments, and a dazzling light burst forth in all directions, illuminating the shocked faces of the disciples.</p><p></p><p>Boom!</p><p></p><p>Suddenly, a flash of black lightning streaked across the sky, and a thin arc of lightning descended from above.</p><p></p><p>Though small, in the eyes of the three black-tongued demons, it was magnified immensely!</p><p></p><p>Even though it was tiny, it was still the power of lightning - containing enough energy to rival a Golden Core cultivator's full-force attack!</p><p></p><p>"Flee!"</p><p></p><p>In an instant, the three black-tongued demons lost the will to fight, fear taking over as they tried to escape as black mist.</p><p></p><p>But alas, they could not outrun the lightning arc.</p><p></p><p>Soon, the lightning struck the three black-tongued demons.</p><p></p><p>Sizzle, sizzle, sizzle...</p><p></p><p>Immediately, black smoke rose up as the three black-tongued demons howled in agony towards the sky.</p><p></p><p>"Ahhhhh!"</p><p></p><p>Here is the full English translation of the Chinese excerpt:</p><p></p><p>As the awe-inspiring sound dissipated, the three black-tongued demons disappeared forever under the thunderous arc.</p><p></p><p>Jiayuan City fell into silence.</p><p></p><p>Thud.</p><p></p><p>Tongxin, disregarding the dazed disciples, stumbled and fell to the ground. His face showed no joy, only a vacant stare as he murmured:</p><p></p><p>"Master, the talisman left behind by the Grandmaster has been used up by this disciple... Why, why do second-tier demonic monsters appear in the mortal realm?"</p><p></p><p>It could be said that without the talisman, not only these Qi-refining disciples behind him, but even Tongxin himself, who was at the Foundation Establishment stage, would have likely perished in the mortal realm today.</p><p></p><p>At the same time,</p><p></p><p>In the Luo Manor in Moyu Town,</p><p></p><p>Three black-tongued demons stood facing Luchang Sheng.</p><p></p><p>Their ugly faces wore a mocking sneer as they looked down on the young man in blue.</p><p></p><p>They guessed that the man in blue robes was likely a Taoist priest. With his elegant attire, if he wore a Taoist hat and carried a wooden sword on his back, he would fit the image of a Taoist priest.</p><p></p><p>The reason they thought so was that aside from the occasional descent of cultivators, there were many Taoist priests in the mortal realm who specialized in slaying demons and monsters.</p><p></p><p>However, those so-called half-baked Taoist priests did not scare them. Most of those half-baked Taoist priests were merely Qi-refining cultivators who had given up on the immortal path and retreated to the mortal realm.</p><p></p><p>"No, this person should not be a Taoist priest. If he were merely at the Qi-refining stage, we would have been able to sense it! But in our perception, his cultivation is unusually obscure. This means he is at least at the Foundation Establishment stage, a true cultivator from the immortal realm!" one of the black-tongued demons suddenly growled.</p><p></p><p>Qi-refining cultivators, they had no reason not to sense them. So he must be a Foundation Establishment cultivator!</p><p></p><p>They did not think a mighty Golden Core cultivator would descend into the mortal realm without reason.</p><p></p><p>However, they did not know which specific level of the Foundation Establishment stage this man in blue robes was at.</p><p></p><p>"Hmph, a Foundation Establishment cultivator, so what? We three can take on even a mid-stage Foundation Establishment cultivator! Since this cultivator is seeking death, then we shall kill him!" one of the black-tongued demons hissed maliciously, lashing out his long tongue.</p><p></p><p>"Three demonic beasts with strength akin to mortal Foundation Establishment cultivators? Why do you brazenly invade the mortal realm?" Luchang Sheng asked them calmly.</p><p></p><p>Normally, the occasional appearance of Qi-refining demonic beasts in this lowly world would be understandable, but the presence of so many Foundation Establishment demonic beasts was rather abnormal.</p><p></p><p>Didn't they fear incurring the displeasure of the immortal realm?</p><p></p><p>"Hahaha, the immortal realm? The Lingchen Realm has been too peaceful for too long... The demonic and immortal realms have already formed an alliance, and we will soon bring the Lingchen Realm under our control!" the black-tongued demon boasted, his tone laced with resentment. "This is just the beginning, hahaha!"</p><p></p><p>The other two black-tongued demons also felt no qualms about it, since they believed this man was doomed to die. Venting their mouths at this moment was satisfying to their hearts.</p><p></p><p>Luchang Sheng nodded slightly.</p><p></p><p>So this "Lingchen Realm" world was about to become unstable, this was what he had learned.</p><p></p><p>"Cultivator, don't you want to ask why?" the three black-tongued demons exclaimed in exasperation, seeing the man in blue's indifferent expression.</p><p></p><p>This was not the reaction they had expected. Shouldn't this man be showing extreme panic upon hearing such a horrifying revelation?</p><p></p><p>"Why?" Luchang Sheng asked seriously.</p><p></p><p>This perfunctory attitude directly enraged the three black-tongued demons!</p><p></p><p>"Kill him!"</p><p></p><p>As the three black snakes charged at him furiously, Luchang Sheng suddenly smiled.</p><p></p><p>"Even true immortals must fear me as if I were a god. You three... are quite brave."</p>

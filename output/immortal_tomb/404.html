        <h1>Chapter 404</h1>
        <div class="content">
            <p>Here is the full English translation of the Chinese excerpt:</p><p></p><p>At the Divine God Plaza, after the peak clans had retrieved their holy sons and daughters, they bid farewell to Jian Wuhui and the others, and departed one by one.</p><p></p><p>Of course, the peak clans did not dare to covet the resources left behind by the Divine God Clan.</p><p></p><p>Finally, the vast Divine God Plaza was left with only about a hundred human cultivators, appearing extremely small and insignificant.</p><p></p><p>The old turtle glanced at them, then silently walked away towards the human cultivators, giving them space.</p><p></p><p>The crowd gradually relaxed, then excitedly looked up at the top position on the Myriad Clan Ranking.</p><p></p><p>But soon, the smiles on their faces slowly faded.</p><p></p><p>They thought of the Gold Wheel King.</p><p></p><p>Yan Jueyi suddenly turned his head to look at the spot where Han Jinlong had previously died, and saw some fragments there.</p><p></p><p>He quickly went over and picked one up, gently rubbing it between his fingers.</p><p></p><p>This was the Blazing Sun Divine Wheel, but it had been shattered by the Divine God Master, leaving only fragments behind.</p><p></p><p>"The Scepter Saint..."</p><p></p><p>Jian Wuhui and the others came to Yan Jueyi's side, sighing deeply.</p><p></p><p>If one were to say who among the four of them was the most devastated by the Gold Wheel King's death, it would undoubtedly be Yan Jueyi. After all, Yan Jueyi and the Gold Wheel King had worked together in the human city for many years, their time together being the longest.</p><p></p><p>Yan Jueyi lowered his head and looked at the fragments, gripping them tighter and tighter, saying in a hoarse voice, "That dream... that dream... why didn't I remember it at the time? If I had remembered, I might have been able to stop him."</p><p></p><p>Jian Wuhui suddenly paused, also deeply regretting and feeling guilty, his face aged considerably.</p><p></p><p>This calamity was unavoidable.</p><p></p><p>At the time, Shengtian was about to annihilate him, but the Gold Wheel King's appearance had resulted in the latter's death instead.</p><p></p><p>In simple terms, between the two of them, one had to die.</p><p></p><p>And the Gold Wheel King at the time... to be honest, he really did it for Jian Wuhui!</p><p></p><p>Jian Wuhui tilted his head back, tears sliding down the corners of his eyes.</p><p></p><p>Yan Jueyi also suddenly realized this, and turned his head apologetically to look at Jian Wuhui: "Lord Jian, I..."</p><p></p><p>Jian Wuhui opened his eyes, waving his hand weakly: "It's alright. If time could be turned back, this lord would rather have perished himself than have the Gold Wheel King..."</p><p></p><p>Man Tian took a deep breath and couldn't help but sigh, "If only the Immortal Lord had arrived a step earlier..."</p><p></p><p>Their expressions changed slightly.</p><p></p><p>Jian Wuhui immediately fixed his gaze on Man Tian, speaking in a stern tone: "Man King, the Immortal Lord is not of our human race, he has no obligation..."</p><p></p><p>Man Tian's body trembled, realizing he had spoken out of turn, and he closed his mouth, not daring to say anything more.</p><p></p><p>Jian Wuhui's gaze became hazy as he said, "Even before, this lord had noticed that Shengtian was already biased against our human race, even to this day, this lord still cannot find the reason. </p><p></p><p>"So, even if there had been no matter of the Jade Heart, our human race would have had great difficulty in surviving this calamity, it's not as simple as just the loss of a single Sect Master.</p><p></p><p>"Moreover, the Jade Heart, the Immortal Lord had left the vast majority to our human race, only taking away a mere five hundred for himself..."</p><p></p><p>"If we had known earlier that the Immortal Lord was not of the human race, then even if he had arrived and stood by watching us be wiped out without lifting a finger, this lord would have no complaints!"</p><p></p><p>"But the Immortal Lord did intervene and rescue us, even elevating our human race to the top position of the Myriad Clans!"</p><p></p><p>"With such a great kindness and virtue, as the greatest beneficiaries, how could we, how dare we, expect the Immortal Lord to have arrived even sooner?"</p><p></p><p>Man Tian swallowed hard, saying with difficulty, "Lord Jian, it was my mistake to have spoken out of turn. I acknowledge my error."</p><p></p><p>He then harshly slapped his own mouth, causing his lips to swell.</p><p></p><p>This scene left Fang Yun, Mo Liang Qiu and the others who were observing from afar, stunned.</p><p></p><p>"What's wrong with the Man King, why is he slapping his own mouth like that?"</p><p></p><p>Here is my translation of the Chinese excerpt:</p><p></p><p>"Zhao Di?" Zhao Di scratched his head, puzzled.</p><p></p><p>"Hmph." Mo Liang Qiu suddenly looked at Zhao Di and coldly laughed.</p><p></p><p>Zhao Di: "?"</p><p></p><p>Mo Liang Qiu cupped his hands towards Zhao Di and said, "Zhao Di, I suddenly remembered something. Do you recall how you went to the Xian He Tavern in the City of Man to challenge the Immortal Lord one-on-one? I'm quite impressed."</p><p></p><p>Upon hearing this, the people on the City Battle Ranking of the Shen Xuan Realm, including Shui Ting Hen, all recalled this matter and looked at Zhao Di with mixed expressions.</p><p></p><p>Zhao Di had once challenged the number one person on the Divine Demon Battlefield, the Immortal Lord, who was even revered by the Heavenly Dao Lord. </p><p></p><p>This guy, Zhao Di, could boast about this for the rest of his life.</p><p></p><p>Of course, whether Zhao Di dared to boast was another matter.</p><p></p><p>What? Zhao Di had even challenged the Immortal Lord?</p><p></p><p>The other Heavenly City Fang Yun as well as the Shen Xuan Realm cultivators from the Earth City were all shocked to see Zhao Di!</p><p></p><p>This rascal Zhao Di actually survived until now?</p><p></p><p>Zhao Di's face flushed deeply red, wishing he could find a crack in the ground to crawl into.</p><p></p><p>Zhao Di first looked up at the sky in alarm, then half-pleadingly, half-bitterly said, "Don't laugh at me... Who knew back then... The Immortal Lord defeated me with a single move, but he didn't kill me. The Immortal Lord probably didn't want to bother with a junior like me..."</p><p></p><p>Zhao Di was inwardly terrified. He had almost forgotten about this matter, but now that Mo Liang Qiu had brought it up, he was nearly scared out of his wits.</p><p></p><p>The crowd coughed awkwardly, not daring to say anything more.</p><p></p><p>When it came to the Immortal Lord, it was better to remain silent behind his back.</p><p></p><p>...</p><p></p><p>"A true dream?"</p><p></p><p>Jian Wu Hui's group looked at Yan Jue Yi with slightly puzzled expressions.</p><p></p><p>Yan Jue Yi solemnly nodded and said vaguely, "That wine is called Dream-Entering Brew, and the Golden Wheel King said it was a gift from the Immortal Lord. Drinking it would allow one to enter a dream, and the dream they had actually came true in the future..."</p><p></p><p>Jian Wu Hui's group heard this, their pupils contracting slightly, somewhat unbelieving.</p><p></p><p>Yan Jue Yi said sadly, "The Golden Wheel King had told me at the time that he dreamed of the scene of the human race becoming the number one in all the tribes..."</p><p></p><p>Saying this, Yan Jue Yi looked at the Tribal Ranking in the sky and said hoarsely, "Unexpectedly, this day has really come, and it came so quickly... It's just a pity that this scene, the Golden Wheel King could only see in his dreams, and he couldn't experience the reality of it."</p><p></p><p>Jian Wu Hui's group fell silent, not expecting such a thing to exist.</p><p></p><p>Does a wine that can foresee the future really exist in this world?</p><p></p><p>At this time, Jiang Wu Xin puzzledly said, "But that doesn't make sense. If the Golden Wheel King dreamed of witnessing the rise of the human race, but his physical body had already perished before that, then he couldn't have seen it in reality. There's a contradiction."</p><p></p><p>Jiang Wu Xin continued:</p><p></p><p>"For example, like the Stick Saint, he was able to witness the Golden Wheel King's demise with his own eyes, verifying the dream of the past."</p><p></p><p>Jian Wu Hui's group was stunned for a moment, feeling a bit tangled up and unable to sort it out for the time being.</p><p></p><p>After a moment, Yan Jue Yi looked at the fragments of the Blazing Sun Celestial Wheel in his hand and murmured softly, "If that were the case, it would be good. Perhaps the dream is ultimately just a dream, and the wine is just wine, not to be confused with reality."</p><p></p><p>After a period of silence, Jian Wu Hui waved his hand and said, "For now, the priority is to integrate the resources of the Heavenly Tribe, and then collect the fragments of the Golden Wheel King's Blazing Sun Celestial Wheel. I'm sure our human cultivators are eagerly awaiting our return."</p><p></p><p>"Mm." The three of them nodded, temporarily not thinking about the strange dream anymore.</p>

        <h1>Chapter 154</h1>
        <div class="content">
            <p>Here is the full English translation of the Chinese excerpt:</p><p></p><p>"Mm. ‚ôö‚ôû‚ùª‚ûà≈üƒßùïåÔº∏.ùî†·ªñÔΩçüêªüíù"</p><p></p><p>Left Chou Shan and the others nodded slightly and walked towards the courtyard gate.</p><p></p><p>Seeing only twelve people, Tong Xin's face showed surprise as he looked outside and asked, "The inn can accommodate eight more people, why aren't you coming in?"</p><p></p><p>Immediately, the cultivators in the front repeatedly waved their hands awkwardly, "Haha, we're the next batch, the next batch..."</p><p></p><p>They dared not stay in the same small space as the four top power leaders... They were truly afraid that something might go wrong, and they wouldn't even know how they died.</p><p></p><p>"Oh, okay, then you guests please wait outside the courtyard. Shidi, this is up to you now."</p><p></p><p>Tong Xin bowed slightly and then quickly turned around and ran back into the inn.</p><p></p><p>.........</p><p></p><p>When Left Chou Shan and the others entered the inn, the first thing they saw was the young man in blue robes reclining in the rocking chair, swaying back and forth, looking quite at ease.</p><p></p><p>The young man in blue had cascading black hair, a handsome and refined appearance, and a well-defined jawline that gave an impression of gentleness rather than sharpness.</p><p></p><p>The four power leaders' eyes flickered, just about to speak, when Tong Xin nearby chuckled, "Guests, please have a seat. I'll go get you some Xiu Huan Jiu (Wash Soul Wine)."</p><p></p><p>Left Chou Shan and the others paused, reluctantly swallowing their words and taking their seats for the time being.</p><p></p><p>The four power leaders sat at one table, Left Qi Ran and Left You at another, and the other three powers' champions each had their own table.</p><p></p><p>The four power leaders briefly surveyed the inn interior, then fixed their gaze directly on Lu Changsheng.</p><p></p><p>As for Left Qi Ran and the others, they stole glances at him, knowing that the innkeeper was a Xian Zun (Immortal Venerable) level expert, and as juniors, they did not dare to look at him directly.</p><p></p><p>Su Qianghe rolled his eyes and chuckled, taking the lead in speaking, "Ah, I've finally made it in. Innkeeper, I've really been waiting for you. For your divine Xiu Huan Jiu, old Su has been waiting the entire night!"</p><p></p><p>Huh?</p><p></p><p>The crowd was taken aback. Waited the entire night? Wasn't it just less than half an incense stick's worth of time?</p><p></p><p>Left Chou Shan and the other power leaders' eyes flashed, inwardly sneering. Well, this Su Qianghe, he really knows how to play his cards, doesn't he...</p><p></p><p>His calculations are spot on.</p><p></p><p>The first sentence after entering was to try and curry favor with the inn's innkeeper!</p><p></p><p>On the surface, he appears simple-minded, but in reality, his heart is extremely cunning!</p><p></p><p>As for Lu Changsheng, he continued to lie leisurely in the rocking chair, eyes closed, without responding.</p><p></p><p>Su Qianghe's gaze slightly hardened upon seeing this.</p><p></p><p>"Haha, come on, Subangjun, who among us hasn't been waiting the entire night for that Xiu Huan Jiu?" </p><p></p><p>At this time, Yin Jiuguai mocked with a sneer. </p><p></p><p>His gaze at Su Qianghe carried a hint of derision, the meaning clear: Everyone here knows the purpose of coming to the inn, so don't put on an act.</p><p></p><p>Su Qianghe looked displeased and glared at Yin Jiuguai, not wanting to speak for the moment.</p><p></p><p>Left Chou Shan pursed his lips, glanced at Lu Changsheng, and after a moment of consideration, politely said:</p><p></p><p>"Innkeeper, I am Left Chou Shan of the Tian She Manor. These three are Su Qianghe of the Jufu Gang, Zhao Wuyou of the Yingyou Tower, and Yin Jiuguai of the Kongpou Dao. We can see that you are no ordinary person. May we know your honorable name? Perhaps we've heard of it before."</p><p></p><p>Lu Changsheng's brow slightly furrowed as he replied indifferently, "Lu Changsheng."</p><p></p><p>Lu Changsheng?</p><p></p><p>The crowd suddenly understood. No wonder the inn was called Changsheng, it was named after the owner's name. That made sense.</p><p></p><p>But to take "Changsheng" as a name... It was a bit arrogant, wasn't it?</p><p></p><p>Who in the world dares to call themselves "Changsheng" (Eternal Life)?</p><p></p><p>In the Heavenly Markings, even those at the Xian Di (Immortal Emperor) realm, or even the rumored Xian Zu (Immortal Ancestor) peak experts, would not dare to call themselves "Changsheng", right?</p><p></p><p>At this moment, Lu Changsheng opened his eyes and glanced at them, seemingly aware of their thoughts, and lightly chuckled.</p><p></p><p>Here is the full English translation of the Chinese excerpt:</p><p></p><p>"Gentlemen, it's just a name, no need to think too much about it," the innkeeper said while reclining in his rocking chair.</p><p></p><p>The group, including Left Qiu Shan, nodded slightly, with their brows slightly furrowed.</p><p></p><p>Even until now, the innkeeper was still lying in the rocking chair, which was... somewhat impolite.</p><p></p><p>Just then, Tong Xin came out carrying a tray. He placed the twelve jars of Xixian Liquor one by one in front of the guests, bowing and smiling, "Esteemed guests, this is the Xixian Liquor. Do you need any dishes to go with the wine?"</p><p></p><p>"Haha, no need," Left Qiu Shan chuckled.</p><p></p><p>"Alright, if you need anything else, please let me know. Enjoy your drinks, esteemed guests." </p><p></p><p>Tong Xin then went to stand by the counter, holding the tray.</p><p></p><p>The inn was quiet, and everyone's gaze was slightly different.</p><p></p><p>Since Left Qi Ran and the other overlords had not made a move yet, and the four major faction leaders had not started drinking, they naturally did not dare to be the first to enjoy it.</p><p></p><p>The four members of Left Qiu Shan exchanged a glance, instantly reaching a tacit understanding. Since they had come, they might as well try this Xixian Liquor that had been spoken of so highly.</p><p></p><p>As for the recruitment matter, they could discuss it while drinking.</p><p></p><p>So, they pulled off the jar lids with a 'thud' sound.</p><p></p><p>Instantly, the rich and unique aroma of the liquor permeated the inn!</p><p></p><p>Everyone felt as if their souls were being cleansed.</p><p></p><p>Sss...</p><p></p><p>The four members of Left Qiu Shan's bodies suddenly trembled, their Adam's apples frantically bobbing up and down!</p><p></p><p>What kind of fragrance was this??</p><p></p><p>Before coming to Qingxuan Town, they had traveled to some places in the Heavenly Scar, but they had never encountered any liquor aroma that could shake them like this!</p><p></p><p>The other overlords also had flushed faces and excited expressions.</p><p></p><p>Only Left Qi Ran was slightly better, as she had tasted it the day before and was mentally prepared. However, she still couldn't help but swallow and lick her lips.</p><p></p><p>So... delicious...</p><p></p><p>At this point, the four members of Left Qiu Shan had already impatiently poured themselves a cup each. They solemnly held the wine cups with both hands, their demeanor extremely solemn.</p><p></p><p>When drinking such an extraordinary vintage, a sense of ritual was indispensable, otherwise it would be a waste!</p><p></p><p>The four raised their cups slightly towards Lu Changsheng, then took a sip. Instantly, their expressions became even more excited.</p><p></p><p>Good! Excellent wine!!</p><p></p><p>Su Qianghe's eyes even turned red, his expression becoming somewhat frenzied. It was too delicious!</p><p></p><p>He loved wine more than anything, and in this lifetime, he never imagined he would have the chance to drink such an extraordinary wine!</p><p></p><p>Even if it meant his death right now, he would be willing!</p><p></p><p>Afterwards, everyone took a deep breath and tilted their heads back, draining the cups in one gulp.</p><p></p><p>The four closed their eyes, savoring the images in their minds, the fragrance in their nostrils, the sensations on their taste buds, and the cleansing of their souls. Corners of their mouths uncontrollably curled up.</p><p></p><p>This scene was quite bizarre.</p><p></p><p>Left Qi Ran and Left You, along with the other overlords, also opened the wine jars and began drinking the Xixian Liquor.</p><p></p><p>Instantly, the same scene repeated itself, and they became deeply immersed, unable to extricate themselves.</p><p></p><p>Ten breaths later, the four members of Left Qiu Shan finally opened their eyes. They exchanged surprised glances, sighing with emotion.</p><p></p><p>This Xixian Liquor was truly the most extraordinary wine they had ever tasted in their lives!</p><p></p><p>No, the other wines were not good wines, they were trash!</p><p></p><p>Left Qiu Shan suddenly looked at Tong Xin and urgently said, "Little waiter, how much Xixian Liquor do you have in stock? My lord... wants it all!"</p><p></p><p>"Left Qiu Shan, you're dreaming!" </p><p></p><p>Before Yin Jiuguai and Zhao Wuyou could express their displeasure, Su Qianghe suddenly stood up!</p><p></p><p>This startled the immersed Left Qi Ran and the other overlords, instantly snapping them out of their dazed state. They were filled with confusion, wondering what had happened.</p><p></p><p>Su Qianghe's eyes were bloodshot, the veins on his neck bulging. He glared at Left Qiu Shan, his words seemingly forced out through gritted teeth.</p><p></p><p>"If you want to hoard the Xixian Liquor today, you'll have to trample over my dead body, Su Qianghe's!"</p>

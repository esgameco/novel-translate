        <h1>Chapter 189</h1>
        <div class="content">
            <p>Here is the full English translation of the Chinese excerpt:</p><p></p><p>"Hahaha!" Huang Bin finally burst out laughing, "I'm sure you've been tricked!"</p><p></p><p>Seeing this, Cai Xu became annoyed, jumping up like a chicken and shouting, "Then dare you come with me to the Xiaoyao Sect? After all, the entrance exams of the three major sects will last for nearly half a month, so there's no need to hurry!"</p><p></p><p>Seeing Cai Xu stubbornly refusing to back down, Huang Bin shouted, "Alright, let's go!"</p><p></p><p>He reacted and suddenly asked, "Hey, how do you know the address of the Xiaoyao Sect?"</p><p></p><p>Cai Xu raised his head proudly and said, "Hmph, you don't understand. Shixiong Tongxin said I'm a talent, and he specially gave me a map of the Xiaoyao Sect, saying that if I'm interested, I can go there anytime."</p><p></p><p>Huang Bin: "......"</p><p></p><p>...</p><p></p><p>The Xiaoyao Sect was built in a place with a misty, immortal aura, south of Canglang Zhou, not too far from Feiyun City. </p><p></p><p>From a distance, the mountains were stacked, the clouds and mist were floating, and cranes were soaring through the mist. Through the mist, one could vaguely see many pavilion-like buildings. </p><p></p><p>In addition, there was a waterfall thousands of feet long between the mountains, flowing straight down into a deep blue lake.</p><p></p><p>Under the warm sun, it was like a fairyland.</p><p></p><p>"Wow!!! Little Black, the Xiaoyao Sect is so grand!" Huang Bin exclaimed in amazement.</p><p></p><p>Cai Xu was also somewhat shocked. He looked at the map carefully, confirming that this was indeed the Xiaoyao Sect.</p><p></p><p>To be honest, the Xiaoyao Sect was a bit remote. If not for the map, it would not be easy to find it in a short time.</p><p></p><p>"Hehe, now do you believe it? A sect that's not even a high rank can be so grand?" Cai Xu said, then excitedly said, "Come on, Abin, let's be the first to try!"</p><p></p><p>Huang Bin snapped out of it and hurried to catch up. Even though he hadn't seen anyone yet, he had already believed most of it.</p><p></p><p>At the sect gate, there were two disciples standing upright, not looking sideways. </p><p></p><p>They wore disciple robes of gold and white, with leather boots and a disciple token hanging at their waists. </p><p></p><p>Their spirit and bearing looked quite good.</p><p></p><p>"Hehe, the sect is almost ready now. It won't be long before we start recruiting disciples. Then the Xiaoyao Sect will surely make a name for itself in Canglang Zhou!" Xu Ao said proudly.</p><p></p><p>Zhao Cheng smiled and suddenly asked through voice transmission, "Shidi Xu, where has the Sect Master been these past few years? We haven't seen him since we came to Canglang Zhou to establish the sect."</p><p></p><p>"Shixiong, you're making it difficult for me. The Sect Master has always been elusive. As ordinary outer disciples, how could we possibly see such a figure?" Xu Ao replied.</p><p></p><p>"That's true... I miss the old days in Qingxuan Town, when we could just go to the tavern and see the Sect Master," Zhao Cheng sighed.</p><p></p><p>Just as the two were chatting casually, two figures appeared outside the mountain gate, sneaking around.</p><p></p><p>Zhao Cheng and Xu Ao were not surprised. They had already sensed them, but these two cultivators had a weak aura, so they didn't pay much attention.</p><p></p><p>"Halt!" Zhao Cheng's eyes flashed, and a sharp sword appeared in his hand, pointing at the two.</p><p></p><p>Cai Xu and Huang Bin were startled, feeling the sword's sharpness, and quickly stopped in their tracks, bowing down. Cai Xu hurriedly raised the map and shouted tremblingly, "We, we came according to the map given by Shixiong Tongxin!"</p><p></p><p>Tongxin Shixiong?!</p><p></p><p>Zhao Cheng and Xu Ao exchanged glances, and Zhao Cheng put away his sword and said in a deep voice, "Wait a moment, I'll send a message to Shixiong Tongxin."</p><p></p><p>"Yes, yes!" Cai Xu and Huang Bin nodded repeatedly.</p><p></p><p>They glanced at each other in secret, their eyes flashing with excitement. It seems they have discovered a treasure! This Xiaoyao Sect is truly extraordinary!</p><p></p><p>The two gate disciples are so powerful...</p><p></p><p>After a moment, Zhao Cheng's expression visibly softened, and he smiled at Cai Xu and Huang Bin, "Shixiong Tongxin said he'll be here soon."</p><p></p><p>Here is the full English translation of the Chinese excerpt:</p><p></p><p>"Apologies, senior brother." Cai Xu and Huang Bin paid their respects.</p><p></p><p>Soon, a young man in white and gold robes, with a face as pure as jade, appeared before them.</p><p></p><p>"Brother Tong!" </p><p></p><p>Zhao Cheng and Xu Ao were startled and quickly paid their respects.</p><p></p><p>"Hehe, my junior brothers, please rise." Tong Xin waved his hand, then looked at the delighted Cai Xu and smiled, "Little Black, you've finally come, I had already noticed that you are a talented one."</p><p></p><p>Cai Xu regained his composure and quickly led Huang Bin forward to pay respects, introducing him, "Brother Tong, this is Huang Bin, he is my junior disciple, and he..."</p><p></p><p>Tong Xin waved his hand indifferently, interrupting, "No need, no need. Come, I'm free today, so I'll personally take you to have a look around our Xiaoyao Sect."</p><p></p><p>With that, he turned and headed inside.</p><p></p><p>Cai Xu and Huang Bin were overjoyed, paid their respects to Zhao Cheng and Xu Ao, then hurriedly followed after him.</p><p></p><p>Zhao Cheng straightened up and shook his head with a smile, "These two youngsters actually know Brother Tong, they are indeed fortunate."</p><p></p><p>Xu Ao also smiled, "Yes, when we formally recruit disciples later, we definitely won't have it as easy to enter the Xiaoyao Sect."</p><p></p><p>...</p><p></p><p>At the rear mountain of the Xiaoyao Sect, the place was lush and green, with birdsong and fragrant flowers.</p><p></p><p>By the pool pavilion, a figure in green was seated, sipping wine alone.</p><p></p><p>Outside the pavilion, a fat man stood bowing.</p><p></p><p>"Is the matter of recruiting disciples within the sect almost ready?" Luchang Sheng put down his cup and asked softly.</p><p></p><p>Peng Fang trembled slightly, respectfully replying, "Yes, Sect Master, your intention is... to recruit disciples?"</p><p></p><p>"Correct, the number of disciples in the sect has decreased a bit. As for the recruitment threshold, disciple treatment, and other trivial matters, you will be fully responsible for handling them," Luchang Sheng said with a smile.</p><p></p><p>"The Sect Master can rest assured." Peng Fang responded respectfully.</p><p></p><p>Seeing this, Luchang Sheng smiled and said, "Since the main matter is settled, come and have a drink with me."</p><p></p><p>Peng Fang's heart immediately relaxed, and he stood up straight, walking into the pavilion with a smile on his face. He sat down by the stone table, skillfully pouring a cup of wine for Luchang Sheng and one for himself.</p><p></p><p>He raised his cup, smacking his lips and chuckling, "Sect Master, if those fellows like Su Qianghe and Zuo Cishan knew I was drinking with you again, they'd probably be so jealous they'd vomit blood, haha."</p><p></p><p>Luchang Sheng chuckled, waving his sleeve to produce five more jugs of wine on the table, saying, "Take these to them later."</p><p></p><p>Peng Fang's eyes lit up, putting down his cup and laughing, "Then I'll thank the Sect Master on their behalf first."</p><p></p><p>He then waved his hand, and the five jugs of wine disappeared into his personal spatial storage.</p><p></p><p>As for whether Peng Fang would actually give them to Su Qianghe, Zuo Cishan, and the others... that remains unknown.</p><p></p><p>"Sect Master, the three nearby sects of the Nine Rank seem to also be starting to recruit disciples tomorrow. I expect our Xiaoyao Sect will snatch up all the talented seedlings, leaving only the mediocre or inferior ones for them, hehe," Peng Fang said with a laugh.</p><p></p><p>For some reason, he always had a strange sense of satisfaction in acting like a wolf in sheep's clothing. How strange, he never noticed it before.</p><p></p><p>Up until now, he still wasn't clear on Luchang Sheng's purpose in establishing the Xiaoyao Sect here in Linglang Heavens, but connecting it to the Heaven's Scar, he seemed to have a vague understanding.</p><p></p><p>Luchang Sheng spoke softly, "Recruiting disciples is up to their own merits. If they're smart, it's fine. If they come to cause trouble, you can give them a lesson. And if they still don't listen or cause other issues... then eliminate them."</p><p></p><p>"Understood." Peng Fang's eyes narrowed, nodding in agreement.</p>

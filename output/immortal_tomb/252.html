        <h1>Chapter 252</h1>
        <div class="content">
            <p>Here is the full English translation of the Chinese excerpt:</p><p></p><p>"Your left cheek is swollen, isn't it? Is the pain unbearable, coming in waves? Is it difficult for you to chew food?"</p><p></p><p>"Haven't you been having frequent abdominal pain and spasms, feeling weak?"</p><p></p><p>"Aren't you inexplicably anxious and panicked in your heart, with night sweats for no reason?"</p><p></p><p>"Isn't your grandmother bedridden at home, infected with typhoid fever?"</p><p></p><p>"........"</p><p></p><p>Xiao Tong said one after another, her face slightly flushed, feeling embarrassed.</p><p></p><p>Of course, she couldn't have done this - how could she possibly know all these details without even checking the pulse? She wasn't that skilled, just relying on appearances to see so much.</p><p></p><p>Even more absurd was that she had miraculously mentioned the bedridden old grandmother in the other person's family.</p><p></p><p>This was beyond the realm of medical skills, more like fortune-telling.</p><p></p><p>Because... all of this was transmitted to her mind by the gentleman beside her.</p><p></p><p>She was just reciting what he had told her.</p><p></p><p>The gentleman said to first stabilize these people before continuing...</p><p></p><p>Euphemistically called "letting everyone take a breather."</p><p></p><p>Sure enough!</p><p></p><p>The crowd snapped out of their daze, rushing to bow down to Xiao Tong, shouting:</p><p></p><p>"Divine doctor! Divine doctor!!"</p><p></p><p>"Incredible, you even knew my grandmother at home was infected with typhoid fever - this is a true divine doctor!"</p><p></p><p>"Divine doctor, wait here, I'll immediately carry my grandmother out from home!"</p><p></p><p>Xiao Tong subtly shifted her body, not daring to accept the bowing, and quickly said, "No! The elderly lady with typhoid fever should not be carried out, I'll go to your home!"</p><p></p><p>"Okay! Okay! Thank you, sniff sniff!" The shabby young man was moved to tears.</p><p></p><p>Xiao Tong looked at the crowd, apologetically saying, "Everyone, please wait a moment, I need to attend to the critical cases first."</p><p></p><p>The crowd hurriedly nodded, making way.</p><p></p><p>They were all people of hard lives, so at this time they naturally understood the priorities, not being selfish.</p><p></p><p>"Sir, then Xiao Tong will go first."</p><p></p><p>Xiao Tong bowed to Lu Changsheng, and seeing him nod, she quickly left with the young man.</p><p></p><p>"You all line up, she'll be back soon," Lu Changsheng said, reassuring the crowd.</p><p></p><p>"Yes, yes, doctor, your disciple's medical skills are so impressive, surely you..." Someone looked at Lu Changsheng with admiration.</p><p></p><p>"Of course," Lu Changsheng smiled and nodded.</p><p></p><p>"Doctor, you don't know, the medical clinics in the city are all too expensive, we can't even afford to see a doctor. Someone has typhoid fever, and they usually don't survive. Little Bing's grandmother, we thought she wouldn't make it, Little Bing was so anxious. But now that we have you, we're grateful for you on behalf of Little Bing!"</p><p></p><p>The crowd knelt down, their eyes reddening.</p><p></p><p>Lu Changsheng's eyes flashed with a gentle power, lifting the crowd up, saying, "No need to thank me, just wait."</p><p></p><p>The crowd was slightly startled, realizing this doctor was also a cultivator, and became even more reverential, thanking him again before lining up in an orderly manner.</p><p></p><p>.........</p><p></p><p>"Help! Help!"</p><p></p><p>"Doctor Lu, save us! It's going to explode!"</p><p></p><p>"Ah, it hurts, it hurts so much, I don't want to live anymore."</p><p></p><p>"Hang in there, we're almost at Doctor Lu's clinic."</p><p></p><p>On the streets of Yuanyu Town, a group of old men were bent over, frantically rushing towards Long Sheng Clinic, kicking up a trail of dust, accompanied by agonizing cries.</p><p></p><p>"Haha haha, I hope it hurts you old fools! Daring to mock me? Haha haha! If you mess with me, you'll have to pay the price!"</p><p></p><p>Luo Gu was also sprinting alongside the old men, making mocking faces.</p><p></p><p>The old men, wracked with pain, had no mind to pay attention to Luo Gu, only focused on their frantic running.</p><p></p><p>They had never run this fast in their lives.</p><p></p><p>On the street, the townspeople were bewildered, not knowing what the old men were up to this time.</p><p></p><p>Ever since they started hanging out with the old Luo who sold buns, nothing has been normal.</p><p></p><p>Moments later,</p><p></p><p>Inside Long Sheng Clinic.</p><p></p><p>Hearing the commotion, Tong Xin abruptly stood up, her face serious as she went out to greet them.</p><p></p><p>She saw eight old men rushing into the courtyard, with Luo Gu being the only one not collapsed on the ground, frantically writhing in pain.</p><p></p><p>Here is the full English translation of the Chinese excerpt:</p><p></p><p>"Get out.</p><p></p><p>"Eh, you old gentlemen, what are you doing...?" Tong Xin said confusedly.</p><p></p><p>"Tong, Tong Xin, where's Doctor Lu? We can't take it anymore, it hurts so much!"</p><p></p><p>"It hurts, it hurts too much! We really can't take it anymore, we were wrong!"</p><p></p><p>"Ahhh..."</p><p></p><p>Hearing these agonizing cries and the old men's frenzy, Tong Xin also knew something was wrong. He hurriedly stepped forward.</p><p></p><p>He just wanted to infuse them with spiritual energy to soothe them, but suddenly remembered their symptoms were exactly the same as that day in Luo Valley. If he infused them with spiritual energy, they might suffer even more.</p><p></p><p>But he didn't know any other methods!</p><p></p><p>Refining a detoxifying pill would take some time, and these old bones might not be able to withstand the potency of the pill.</p><p></p><p>Ah, this is troublesome.</p><p></p><p>"You old gentlemen, the master... is not here." Tong Xin took a deep breath, his heart burning with anxiety.</p><p></p><p>What? Doctor Lu is not here?</p><p></p><p>Oh dear, this might cost them their lives.</p><p></p><p>If they went to other towns, they might die of pain on the way.</p><p></p><p>Their lives are doomed! Indeed, lust is a double-edged sword!</p><p></p><p>Luo Valley was just joking, but after hearing that Doctor Lu was not there, his face turned pale.</p><p></p><p>What should they do now...?</p><p></p><p>Tong Xin frowned and pondered hard, feeling like he had forgotten something.</p><p></p><p>The old men were already in unbearable pain, and two of them had even rolled their eyes back.</p><p></p><p>"Ah, that's right!"</p><p></p><p>Tong Xin suddenly remembered something, slapping his palm, and a package appeared in his hand.</p><p></p><p>He quickly opened it, and behold, there were exactly seven medicinal pills inside!</p><p></p><p>Thinking this, Tong Xin didn't feel as sorry for these old men anymore.</p><p></p><p>He associated their agonizing cries, saying they were wrong and such, with them getting what they deserved, being calculated by the master.</p><p></p><p>He then quickly threw the seven pills into their mouths one by one.</p><p></p><p>Phew~</p><p></p><p>The pills took effect quickly.</p><p></p><p>The old men felt relieved, but also passed out from exhaustion.</p><p></p><p>Luo Valley was terrified, these old men were even more miserable than himself last time, it had dragged on for too long.</p><p></p><p>...</p><p></p><p>In Ming Xin City, Xiao Tong treated all the sick people, and Luo Changsheng would teach her face-to-face if she didn't understand something.</p><p></p><p>A few days later, Luo Changsheng, accompanied by Xiao Tong, left the city under the grateful gaze of the impoverished people.</p><p></p><p>Before leaving, Luo Changsheng left a medical book for the boy called Xiao Bing.</p><p></p><p>It only contained treatment plans for common illnesses, nothing too profound.</p><p></p><p>He knew that if he gave this child a too advanced medical book, not only was there no guarantee he could learn it, but more importantly, if it was exposed in this city in the future, it might bring the wrath of the medical houses upon him.</p><p></p><p>This was all he could do.</p><p></p><p>...</p><p></p><p>A few more days passed.</p><p></p><p>The news of the imminent memorial ceremony for the passing of Abbot Jinguan of Tianyin Temple spread to the Divine Emperor Palace and other top powers in the Divine Realm!</p><p></p><p>Not only the various Divine Kings, even Xing Tian and Zu Tian Divine Emperors were shocked!</p><p></p><p>Even the Fallen Abyss and the Endless Demon Abyss had heard of it!</p><p></p><p>The passing of a renowned Buddhist Abbot was the greatest event in thousands of years, no one could remain indifferent!</p><p></p><p>Yet the Tianyan Taoist Observatory, which was in opposition to Tianyin Temple in the Crimson Celestial Realm, was eerily silent.</p><p></p><p>It seemed that a bloody storm was brewing and about to arrive.</p><p></p><p>...</p><p></p><p>In the Primordial Divine Realm, as Lin Chuan was chasing after the old turtle and the others, his figure suddenly paused, and under the bewildered and horrified gaze of the crowd, he slashed a distant mountain range flat with a single sword strike!</p><p></p><p>"Damn it, so much has happened in such a short time!"</p><p></p><p>"The Divine King has ordered, everyone return to the Divine King's Palace!"</p><p></p><p>Lin Chuan glared at the direction where the old turtle and the others had fled, gritting his teeth.</p><p></p><p>Return to the Divine King's Palace? What happened?</p><p></p><p>The crowd was perplexed, not understanding.</p><p></p><p>Lin Chuan closed his eyes, exhaling a breath, and there was also disbelief in his eyes as he said solemnly,</p><p></p><p>"Abbot Jinguan of Tianyin Temple... has passed away."</p><p></p><p>What?!</p><p></p><p>The crowd was shocked to the core.</p>

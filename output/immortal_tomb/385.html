        <h1>Chapter 385</h1>
        <div class="content">
            <p>Here is the full English translation of the Chinese excerpt:</p><p></p><p>In the human domain, it was also very quiet.</p><p></p><p>Even though three months had passed, the cultivators' hearts had not calmed down, but were constantly tense.</p><p></p><p>Especially the faint yet nauseating scent of blood and decay that permeated the air, which constantly stimulated them.</p><p></p><p>Everyone knew that this unpleasant odor was wafting over from the sea of corpses and rivers of blood outside the human domain.</p><p></p><p>Lord Sword Sovereign had ordered not to clean it up, and the crowd also vaguely understood Lord Sword Sovereign's intention.</p><p></p><p>At the same time, in the Imperial Palace of the Sky City.</p><p></p><p>The five human lords were sitting there, seemingly discussing something, with slightly furrowed brows.</p><p></p><p>"It's been three months, and not a single movement from the myriad tribes. What are they up to?" Mantic Heavenly Lock frowned.</p><p></p><p>Han Jinlong sighed, "Who knows? Especially the top ten peak great clans, they just sit and watch their holy sons and daughters being bound, not the least bit anxious. I really don't know what they're planning."</p><p></p><p>Yan Jueyi said, "Could there be some conspiracy?"</p><p></p><p>Jiang Wuxin pondered and then sighed, "Whether they have a conspiracy or not, if we can negotiate peacefully in the end... that would be the best."</p><p></p><p>Upon hearing this, everyone present nodded silently. Of course, peaceful negotiation would be the best.</p><p></p><p>But the truth is, they were not entirely confident.</p><p></p><p>Lord Lu was indeed terrifyingly powerful, but the myriad tribes, not to mention the top ten peak great clans, were numerous and mighty.</p><p></p><p>And... they hadn't seen Lord Lu for three months.</p><p></p><p>In the current situation, they felt uneasy whenever they couldn't see Lord Lu.</p><p></p><p>"By the way, the myriad tribes have given Lord Lu the title of 'Azure Robe Sword Immortal'... it's quite fitting," Mantic Heavenly suddenly laughed.</p><p></p><p>Han Jinlong glanced at the silent Sword Sovereign Wuhuai, "Lord Sword Sovereign, Lord Lu's sword dao..."</p><p></p><p>Sword Sovereign Wuhuai paused, sighing with reverence, "My sword dao is not even one-tenth of Lord Lu's."</p><p></p><p>Sword Sovereign Wuhuai recalled the scene of Lu Changsheng annihilating the myriad tribes, his gaze still filled with longing.</p><p></p><p>That was the ultimate mastery of the sword dao!</p><p></p><p>That level of sword dao, he didn't even dare to imagine it!</p><p></p><p>He had thought that his sword dao had reached the realm of sword heart illumination, the greatest in the divine-demonic battlefield for countless eons.</p><p></p><p>But after seeing Lu Changsheng's sword dao, he realized how utterly inadequate his sword heart illumination was.</p><p></p><p>Sword Sovereign Wuhuai was extremely obsessed with the sword dao. If the timing had been more appropriate, and if Lu Changsheng had not disappeared, he would have definitely begged him to be his teacher and learn the sword dao.</p><p></p><p>"To be honest, if the timing had been right, I would have really wanted to become Lord Lu's disciple," Sword Sovereign Wuhuai said with a wry smile.</p><p></p><p>Jiang Wuxin and the others were slightly startled upon hearing this, but when they recalled Lu Changsheng's unparalleled sword dao, they understood.</p><p></p><p>Indeed, that level of sword dao was far beyond Lord Sword Sovereign's, and it was only natural for him to be fatally attracted to it.</p><p></p><p>Putting themselves in his shoes, if they were also obsessed with the sword dao, they might have been even more frenzied than Sword Sovereign Wuhuai.</p><p></p><p>That feeling might be akin to seeing an oasis in the desert when on the verge of death.</p><p></p><p>Sword Sovereign Wuhuai smiled and pondered, "I believe in Lord Lu's possession of the Eternal Lifeform."</p><p></p><p>Jiang Wuxin and Han Jinlong shook their heads and smiled bitterly.</p><p></p><p>Jiang Wuxin said, "Lord Sword Sovereign, you don't know this, but earlier on the way to the Seven-Colored Crystal Tower, Lord Lu told me and King Jinlun that he has lived for hundreds of billions of years, thousands of billions of years, or even tens of thousands of billions of years..."</p><p></p><p>Sword Sovereign Wuhuai, Mantic Heavenly, and Yan Jueyi were shocked upon hearing this!</p><p></p><p>Lived... for so long, no wonder he is the Eternal Lifeform.</p><p></p><p>It's laughable that they previously addressed Lord Lu as "Little Friend Lu"...</p><p></p><p>Compared to him, they were not even worth mentioning, like mere children.</p><p></p><p>Here is the full English translation of the Chinese excerpt:</p><p></p><p>Just as everyone was deep in thought, a figure in blue suddenly appeared.</p><p></p><p>The five members of the Jian Wuhui were startled, their expressions changing slightly as they quickly stood up from their seats and bowed respectfully, "Lord Lu!"</p><p></p><p>Lu Changsheng waved his sleeve to help them up, "No need for such formalities."</p><p></p><p>The five members of the Jian Wuhui stood up straight and hurriedly invited Lu Changsheng to take the main seat.</p><p></p><p>Lu Changsheng waved his hand and smiled, "I won't be sitting today. I've come to collect some Liuli Hearts."</p><p></p><p>Upon hearing this, the Jian Wuhui immediately brought out all the Liuli Hearts and said, "Lord Lu, please take as many as you need."</p><p></p><p>"That's too many." Lu Changsheng chuckled and casually took five hundred Liuli Hearts, which were naturally for the sect.</p><p></p><p>After collecting the Liuli Hearts, Lu Changsheng prepared to leave.</p><p></p><p>Suddenly, Jian Wuhui bowed and said, "Lord Lu, could you possibly take me as your disciple?"</p><p></p><p>Lu Changsheng paused and turned to look at Jian Wuhui. After a moment, just as he was about to say something, his brow furrowed, and he smiled, "You all don't speak for now."</p><p></p><p>The Jian Wuhui members were puzzled but obeyed the instruction.</p><p></p><p>At that moment, a black mist appeared out of thin air and transformed into a burly middle-aged man in a black robe, with fiery red long hair that exuded a sense of oppression.</p><p></p><p>The Jian Wuhui members frowned deeply, and weapons appeared in their hands.</p><p></p><p>They looked gravely at the man in black, as this outsider had suddenly appeared in the human realm, arriving at the main palace of the Sky City, without them sensing him at all.</p><p></p><p>A powerful expert! An extraordinary expert!</p><p></p><p>But why had they never heard of this person before?</p><p></p><p>What was his purpose in coming to the human realm?</p><p></p><p>Jian Wuhui wanted to speak, but remembering Lu Changsheng's earlier instruction, he held his tongue.</p><p></p><p>"Where is your Lu Nan?" Hunhui asked indifferently, not even bothering to look at the others.</p><p></p><p>When he arrived in the human realm, he was shocked by the sea of corpses and blood outside, realizing that this Lu Nan was truly a ruthless killer. After some inquiries, he had come to the core of the Sky City.</p><p></p><p>Lu Nan?</p><p></p><p>The five members of the Jian Wuhui were immediately on guard.</p><p></p><p>Could it be that the various tribes had begun to act?</p><p></p><p>"What business do you have with Lord Lu?" Jian Wuhui glanced at Lu Changsheng out of the corner of his eye, but he couldn't remain silent any longer.</p><p></p><p>Hunhui looked at Jian Wuhui, his expression coldly indifferent, "Do I need to explain myself to you?"</p><p></p><p>"You!" The members of the Jian Wuhui were immediately angered by his arrogant attitude.</p><p></p><p>Presumptuous!</p><p></p><p>At this moment, Lu Changsheng smiled, "I am the human realm's Lu Nan. I wonder what this friend has come to discuss with me?"</p><p></p><p>Hunhui finally looked at Lu Changsheng. So this was Lu Nan?</p><p></p><p>Hunhui didn't beat around the bush, "Why did you kill so many people?"</p><p></p><p>The five members of the Jian Wuhui were silent. They felt this question was a bit strange, but they couldn't quite put their finger on why.</p><p></p><p>"Do I need to explain to you why I killed people?" Lu Changsheng returned the same words.</p><p></p><p>Hearing this, Hunhui's brow furrowed, and a strange sense of familiarity suddenly arose within him.</p><p></p><p>Hunhui began to scrutinize Lu Changsheng, examining him closely. Apart from his appearance, both his bearing and expression seemed strangely familiar...</p><p></p><p>It was almost as if...</p><p></p><p>At this moment, Lu Changsheng smiled and casually waved his hand, his appearance reverting to its original form.</p>

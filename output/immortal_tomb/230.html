        <h1>Chapter 230</h1>
        <div class="content">
            <p>Here is the full English translation of the Chinese excerpt:</p><p></p><p>The young boy, Tong Xin, saw the young girl standing there dazed, and hurriedly urged, "Xiao Tong, this is the teacher, quickly pay your respects!"</p><p></p><p>Xiao Tong snapped out of it and quickly bowed. When she straightened her frail body, her black eyes were still flashing, as if she was still trying hard to recall something.</p><p></p><p>After a moment, she opened her mouth, trying hard to say something, but no sound came out.</p><p></p><p>"Tong Xin, the brush and ink." Lu Changsheng said softly.</p><p></p><p>In fact, he knew what the little girl wanted to ask, but he would still use paper and pen, which would also help her get familiar with holding a brush.</p><p></p><p>"Ah, yes." Tong Xin immediately understood, and with a flip of his hand, brush, ink, paper and inkstone appeared on the table. He dipped the brush in ink and handed it over, "Xiao Tong, write down what you want to say on this."</p><p></p><p>Xiao Tong took the brush awkwardly, gripping it like a wooden stick, not sure if she was holding it correctly.</p><p></p><p>"It's like this." Tong Xin demonstrated, also holding a brush.</p><p></p><p>Xiao Tong nodded, and then wrote a few crooked characters on the paper, "Teacher, why do I feel like I've seen you somewhere before?"</p><p></p><p>Lu Changsheng walked out from behind the counter, looking at the words on the paper, and said, "Have you been to Yanyu Town before?"</p><p></p><p>Xiao Tong shook her head confusedly. As far as she could remember, she had always been in Yanyu Town.</p><p></p><p>"Then that's it, Tong Xin and I just arrived in Yanyu Town yesterday, how could you have seen me before?" Lu Changsheng said calmly.</p><p></p><p>Xiao Tong wrote a few more words, then bowed and stepped aside.</p><p></p><p>She no longer dwelled on the illusory familiarity, and based on her own situation, it must have been a hallucination.</p><p></p><p>Lu Changsheng looked at the words on the paper, "Teacher, Xiao Tong has overstepped", and nodded slightly, then went back to lie down on the rocking chair, saying, "Tong Xin, first take her to get familiar with the medical house."</p><p></p><p>"Yes, teacher." Tong Xin responded, then looked at Xiao Tong and smiled, "Come, I'll take you to the herb garden in the backyard first."</p><p></p><p>Xiao Tong obediently nodded, glancing at Lu Changsheng in the rocking chair one more time, then followed Tong Xin to the backyard.</p><p></p><p>Lu Changsheng slowly closed his eyes, couldn't help but think of Xing Tian, whom he had crossed paths with in the Heaven's Scar.</p><p></p><p>The daughter of Xing Tian, Wan Shi Jie, had encountered him again in another reincarnation.</p><p></p><p>If he could meet Xing Tian during this trip to the Ancestral Heavenly Realm, perhaps this time Xing Tian would have the chance to see his daughter who was undergoing tribulations.</p><p></p><p>...</p><p></p><p>In the evening,</p><p></p><p>Lu Changsheng casually tossed a medical book in front of Xiao Tong, saying, "The information about all the herbs in the herb garden is written in this book. Memorize it by heart within ten days, and Tong Xin will test you then."</p><p></p><p>"Yes, teacher." Tong Xin quickly responded.</p><p></p><p>Xiao Tong opened the medical book, looking at the various diagrams and dense annotations, her gaze determined.</p><p></p><p>She then hugged the medical book and bowed to Lu Changsheng.</p><p></p><p>Tong Xin had thought the young girl might find it difficult, as the book was so thick, but he was pleasantly surprised...he couldn't help but feel satisfied.</p><p></p><p>It seems that this little herb girl he randomly picked up on the street indeed has a good temperament.</p><p></p><p>Lu Changsheng nodded slightly, then went behind the curtain to the inner room to rest.</p><p></p><p>Tong Xin looked at Xiao Tong and waved his fist, smiling, "Xiao Tong, I forgot to ask the teacher to treat your voice. But don't worry, I'll ask the teacher about it tomorrow. Keep up the good work, but remember, when it's about time, you should sleep."</p><p></p><p>He then quickly went to his own room to cultivate, as he was somewhat anxious about cultivation, after all, Lin Dong's mocking face would occasionally surface in his mind.</p><p></p><p>The lights in the medical house flickered, everything was very quiet, only the sound of Xiao Tong turning the pages of the medical book could be heard. Her small face was full of seriousness.</p><p></p><p>Here is the full English translation of the Chinese excerpt:</p><p></p><p>At the same time,</p><p></p><p>The new 69 book bar 99 SHUX.COM</p><p></p><p>The Spring Fragrance Pavilion in the town.</p><p></p><p>This time period can be said to be the most bustling point of the Spring Fragrance Pavilion. Many people who have been busy all day will come here to get drunk and seek pleasure, which is also a rare form of entertainment in this remote small town.</p><p></p><p>In the Spring Fragrance Pavilion, the lights are bright, the music is playing, and the sounds of teasing and laughter are intertwined.</p><p></p><p>Many elaborately dressed girls are lying in the embrace of customers, with charming and coquettish expressions.</p><p></p><p>Whenever this happens, the customers, who are completely infatuated, will hastily take out a pile of money and stuff it into the snow-white bosoms.</p><p></p><p>The old madam who sees this scene is grinning from ear to ear.</p><p></p><p>After all, the more the girls earn, the more she earns.</p><p></p><p>"Old madam, old madam! Hurry, hurry, hurry! Quickly arrange a girl for this old man!"</p><p></p><p>At this moment,</p><p></p><p>Luo Gu rushed in hurriedly and shouted loudly.</p><p></p><p>The old madam frowned and walked over, sneering at him: "Well, well, well, isn't this the old Luo who sells steamed buns? Why did you come to the Spring Fragrance Pavilion today? This place of smoke and willows is not somewhere an old man like you should come."</p><p></p><p>At the same time, her gaze flickered a bit, because she could see that Luo Gu's condition was a bit off. His usually pale face was now flushed red.</p><p></p><p>Luo Gu heard this and said unhappily, "Hey, who are you looking down on? In the past, when I was young and dominating the Smoke and Rain Town, the owner of the Spring Fragrance Pavilion was you! Old madam, stop talking nonsense and quickly arrange a girl for me!"</p><p></p><p>Luo Gu hurriedly took out half a silver coin from his pocket and threw it into the old madam's hand.</p><p></p><p>He had just recently taken Doctor Lu's medicine, you see.</p><p></p><p>So he was a bit anxious, mainly because he didn't know how long the medicinal effect would last.</p><p></p><p>If the effect was short-lived, wouldn't that be a waste!</p><p></p><p>This was something he would not allow to happen!</p><p></p><p>The old madam's gaze changed slightly, but seeing the silver coin in her hand, she had no choice. When there's business to be done, she wouldn't be a scumbag: "Alright, alright, alright, follow me, and I'll arrange a girl for you."</p><p></p><p>Luo Gu rubbed his hands and grinned as he followed along.</p><p></p><p>In his entire life, he had always been alone, never married a wife, and had no children, so he felt no guilt in coming to the Spring Fragrance Pavilion.</p><p></p><p>...</p><p></p><p>The next day.</p><p></p><p>The old madam's furious voice echoed through the Spring Fragrance Pavilion.</p><p></p><p>"Luo, you old bastard!! Little Lotus has almost been knocked unconscious by you!"</p><p></p><p>"Someone, get him out of here!"</p><p></p><p>Suddenly, many civilians gathered to watch, pointing and staring at the expelled Luo Gu with shocked expressions.</p><p></p><p>"Tsk, I was already very restrained! It's the poor constitution of your Spring Fragrance Pavilion girls that's making me the bad guy? I paid half a silver coin, do you know how many steamed buns I have to sell to earn that back?"</p><p></p><p>Luo Gu cursed and grumbled, then saw the shocked onlookers.</p><p></p><p>He was not ashamed at all, but rather felt that he had never been as glorious as he was at this moment.</p><p></p><p>"Whew, old Luo, you're amazing... truly still vigorous in your old age! I take back my mocking from yesterday."</p><p></p><p>"Old Luo, what's going on? You usually don't come to the Spring Fragrance Pavilion, why did you come this time?"</p><p></p><p>"..."</p><p></p><p>Hearing the words of the crowd, Luo Gu felt both proud and a bit uneasy.</p><p></p><p>The reason he usually didn't come was naturally because he lacked the strength, what else could it be!</p><p></p><p>He laughed and said, "Hehe, just came to visit occasionally. The Spring Fragrance Pavilion is a place that devours gold, of course I can't come often. It's just that the steamed bun business has been good lately, so I came to have some fun. Alright, everyone disperse, disperse."</p><p></p><p>After saying this, Luo Gu, ignoring the people who still wanted to say something, quickly ran away.</p><p></p><p>He had to go back and set up a stall to sell steamed buns to make up for his losses.</p>

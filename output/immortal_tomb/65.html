        <div class="content">
            <p>Here is the full English translation of the Chinese novel excerpt:</p><p></p><p>The Demon Realm Soul Lamp Palace. ‚ôù‚òù69sùî•ùì§–ñ.œÇ‚ìÑ‚ìúüêíüçü</p><p></p><p>The four great Demon Kings looked at the soul lamp on the second row above with difficulty.</p><p></p><p>The rest of the four lamps were burning dimly, but the one in the middle had gone out.</p><p></p><p>And the owner of this soul lamp was precisely Zhao Shenyuan.</p><p></p><p>After a long silence.</p><p></p><p>Chu Qingcang bitterly said, "It's been only a short while since Shenyuan went to the Mortal Realm, and he's already..."</p><p></p><p>"Impossible!"</p><p></p><p>At this time, one of the Demon Kings said in a deep voice, "Apart from those late-stage Transcendent Cultivators in the Mortal Realm, who else could have killed the Demon King Shenyuan? And Zhang Youdao of the Carefree Abode in the Western Domain is about to ascend in three months, and most of the Deity Transformation Cultivators have already rushed to the Western Domain to witness it. Who else could have killed the Demon King Shenyuan?"</p><p></p><p>Several Demon Kings nodded, and Zhao Shenyuan's death seemed mysterious.</p><p></p><p>Just then, Ji Wuqing appeared, and the first thing she did was look at the soul lamp, and her expression changed slightly.</p><p></p><p>"Greetings, My Lord!"</p><p></p><p>The four Demon Kings were startled and quickly bowed in reverence.</p><p></p><p>"Where did Zhao Shenyuan go before?"</p><p></p><p>Ji Wuqing looked at the soul lamp and asked in a calm voice.</p><p></p><p>Chu Qingcang scratched his head and said in a dejected tone, "My Lord, Shenyuan went to the mortal world of the Immortal Realm, to the Lishui Empire in the eastern part of the Eastern Domain, I believe."</p><p></p><p>Although he often quarreled with Zhao Shenyuan, their relationship was actually quite good, and Zhao Shenyuan's death also saddened him.</p><p></p><p>Ji Wuqing's heart trembled, and the image of the blue-robed figure flashed in her mind, as if she had already guessed how Zhao Shenyuan died.</p><p></p><p>Ji Wuqing's sleeve was hanging normally, so the four Demon Kings did not notice that her arm was broken, otherwise, they would have been shocked.</p><p></p><p>"My Lord, we have doubts. Zhang Youdao of the Carefree Abode in the Western Domain will soon ascend, and apart from Jiang Yuan of the Purple Extreme Thunder Peak in the Eastern Domain, Qin Miaomiao of the Northern Domain's Heavenly Snow Holy Palace, and Liu Wuxiu of the Southern Domain's Infinite Pavilion, who else could have killed the Demon King Shenyuan? Is it possible that there was a mistake with the soul lamp..."</p><p></p><p>The Demon King who had raised the question spoke again, but his tone was not as confident, as he had never heard of any mistakes with the soul lamps.</p><p></p><p>Ji Wuqing took a light breath and said indifferently, "Zhao Shenyuan is indeed dead, and you need not doubt it. From now on, you shall temporarily cease all actions against the Immortal Realm!"</p><p></p><p>After saying this, her figure dissipated, and she had to go to the Demon Realm to find Hu Zhan!</p><p></p><p>The four great Demon Kings looked at each other in bewilderment, frozen in place.</p><p></p><p>Zhao Shenyuan was gone, and they felt their brains were not quite up to par.</p><p></p><p>..........</p><p></p><p>A few days later, the weather was clear.</p><p></p><p>Lu Changsheng and the others finally arrived at the gate of the Qingyan Sect without haste or hurry.</p><p></p><p>"Sir, we have arrived. Your arrival is truly a great blessing for our Qingyan Sect for generations to come."</p><p></p><p>Gu Helin's face did not flush, and his breathing was not labored as he flattered.</p><p></p><p>Hearing this, Tong Xin and Lin Dong lowered their heads and pursed their lips, learning from it.</p><p></p><p>"Tsk, Helin, your Qingyan Sect's location is not very impressive, it looks quite unimpressive."</p><p></p><p>At this time, the Old Turtle looked around and shook his head.</p><p></p><p>"Uh, the senior is right," Gu Helin said awkwardly.</p><p></p><p>"Do you believe I can seal your mouth?"</p><p></p><p>Lu Changsheng tilted his head and looked at the Old Turtle indifferently.</p><p></p><p>He knew that the Old Turtle must have seen the more magnificent sects in the Four Directions Immortal Realm, and now he was probably subconsciously comparing the small sect in the Immortal Realm to those.</p><p></p><p>"Master, no, the Old Turtle knows he's wrong."</p><p></p><p>The Old Turtle muttered, then went to the side and dared not speak.</p><p></p><p>Sealing his mouth would be more painful for him, a chatterbox, than killing him.</p><p></p><p>Gu Helin and his disciples pretended not to see it, sighing inwardly that only the Master could control this senior Old Turtle.</p><p></p><p>They had deeply experienced the Old Turtle senior's strength.</p><p></p><p>New 69 Book Bar 99üÜÇüÖ∑üÜÑüÜá.</p><p></p><p>Here is the full English translation of the Chinese excerpt:</p><p></p><p>As L√º Changsheng and the others drew closer to the mountain gate,</p><p></p><p>"Elder Gu, Shixiong Tong, Shixiong Lin!!" </p><p></p><p>The two disciples guarding the mountain gate noticed them and hurriedly came over in joyful greeting.</p><p></p><p>When they saw L√º Changsheng and the old turtle, they paused again, carefully observing the positions of the two. They then obediently bowed and greeted, "Greetings, senior predecessors."</p><p></p><p>Gu Helin, seeing the keen observation skills of the two gate-guarding disciples, praised, "Very good! After your shift, each of you go to the Technique Pavilion and select one intermediate Xuanwei technique scroll. When the Pavilion Elder asks, just say it was instructed by this Elder."</p><p></p><p>"Ah?"</p><p></p><p>The two gate-guarding disciples were dumbfounded. </p><p></p><p>What happened? They were so confused! Such a precious thing was going to be rewarded to them...</p><p></p><p>If possible, could they please explain it?</p><p></p><p>For these outer sect disciples at the Refining Qi realm, having a technique was already good, let alone an intermediate Xuanwei one...</p><p></p><p>(Technique levels: Xuan, Ling, Kun, Qian, each divided into elementary, intermediate, and advanced, which had been introduced earlier in the text.)</p><p></p><p>"Hehe." Gu Helin chuckled and no longer paid attention to the two disciples, turning around respectfully, "Sir, senior predecessors, please."</p><p></p><p>L√º Changsheng nodded slightly and strode in.</p><p></p><p>As the old turtle passed by Gu Helin, he quietly laughed, "Ah, although your Blue Cloud Sect is not grand, your disciples' observation skills are not bad."</p><p></p><p>"Cough, the senior predecessor is too kind." </p><p></p><p>Gu Helin was inwardly delighted to hear this. After glancing at the two gate-guarding disciples again with satisfaction, he quickly followed behind Tong Xinlin.</p><p></p><p>"Whew - Shixiong, I understand now!"</p><p>"Shidi, I understand too!"</p><p></p><p>In the end, the two gate-guarding disciples watched the receding figures in shock, simultaneously saying, "They must be formidable figures, good thing we were cautious... Incredible, incredible... Uh."</p><p></p><p>The two disciples stared at each other blankly, then simultaneously said, "Why are you saying the same thing as me?"</p><p></p><p>"..."</p><p></p><p>Meanwhile,</p><p></p><p>L√º Changsheng's group had arrived at the Blue Cloud Sect's main hall.</p><p></p><p>Along the way, many disciples greeted Gu Helin's group, quickly bowing to L√º Changsheng and the old turtle as well.</p><p></p><p>Gu Helin was secretly satisfied with their keen observation skills. If the conditions allowed, he would have rewarded each disciple with a technique scroll! </p><p></p><p>He was worried that L√º Changsheng and the old turtle would be neglected, but fortunately that did not happen.</p><p></p><p>"Sir, this is our Blue Cloud Sect's main hall, an important place for discussions and receiving distinguished guests. Would you like to take a look inside?"</p><p></p><p>Gu Helin introduced respectfully.</p><p></p><p>In his mind, not bringing the sir to the main hall would mean not valuing and not respecting him.</p><p></p><p>"No need, just find me a place to rest. I'm tired."</p><p></p><p>L√º Changsheng said softly to him.</p><p></p><p>"Ah yes yes yes, after such a long journey, the sir must be tired. The sir and the senior predecessor, please follow Helin."</p><p></p><p>Gu Helin said, slapping his forehead, and hurriedly led the way.</p><p></p><p>Watching the three figures disappear in the distance,</p><p></p><p>Tong Xin said hesitantly, "Shidi, our Master is being too fake... How could a great cultivator like the sir be tired from just a few days of travel?"</p><p></p><p>Lin Dong blankly said, "Yes, Master is blatantly lying, and he's even flattering now... Master has changed."</p><p></p><p>Tong Xin was taken aback, looking at Lin Dong unbelievably!</p><p></p><p>Seeing this, Lin Dong realized he had said the wrong thing, and quickly waved his hands anxiously, "Shixiong, I wasn't talking behind Master's back, that's not what I meant. Please don't report me."</p><p></p><p>"No no no." Tong Xin smiled reassuringly, "Shidi, I was going to say that you've grown up."</p><p></p><p>Lin Dong: "?"</p>

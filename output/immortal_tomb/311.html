        <div class="content">
            <p>Here is the full English translation of the Chinese excerpt:</p><p></p><p>The Ancient Desolate Divine Sword Clan was suddenly shaken!!</p><p></p><p>Countless disciples of the clan heard the solemn words of the Six Sword Masters, but they did not understand. üê§üíù‚ùªÔºô≈úÂçÑœÖ–ñ.‚ÑÇ„Ññ–º‚ô§‚ôü</p><p></p><p>What exactly has come?</p><p></p><p>But in the next moment, their eyes widened uncontrollably as they saw something!</p><p></p><p>Swoosh swoosh swoosh swoosh swoosh swoosh swoosh swoosh!</p><p></p><p>Eight majestic figures appeared in the sky above the Ancient Desolate Divine Sword Clan!</p><p></p><p>"Greetings to the Clan Leader, the Elders, and the Six Great Sword Masters!!"</p><p></p><p>All the disciples of the Ancient Desolate Divine Sword Clan trembled and bowed down.</p><p></p><p>The people had never seen the peak powerhouses of the clan appear together like this before, this was the first time!</p><p></p><p>In the next moment, another figure appeared in the sky, standing opposite the Ancient Desolate Divine Sword Clan.</p><p></p><p>The crowd was dumbfounded.</p><p></p><p>They were certain they had never seen this blue-robed cultivator before.</p><p></p><p>Below, Li Shuyan, Blood Demon Moon, and the others looked up at the nine figures in the sky with grave expressions.</p><p></p><p>This aura was too terrifying!</p><p></p><p>They began to worry in their hearts.</p><p></p><p>Nangong Wanxin and the others had a dazed look in their eyes, their admiration and worship for Lu Changsheng reaching the extreme.</p><p></p><p>To face the Eight Great Dao Realm Experts alone... this boldness was unimaginable!</p><p></p><p>...</p><p></p><p>In the sky above.</p><p></p><p>The Clan Leader, the Elders, and the Six Great Sword Masters of the Ancient Desolate Divine Sword Clan stared intently at the blue-robed cultivator opposite them, their heartbeats slightly accelerating.</p><p></p><p>Could it really be him...</p><p></p><p>They were very sensitive to this person, Lu Changsheng.</p><p></p><p>But they had suppressed Lu Changsheng before, and it had not been long since then, yet he had already broken the seal - they found this hard to accept.</p><p></p><p>Lu Changsheng looked at the eight people across from him and smiled, "It's been a while."</p><p></p><p>As he spoke, he waved his hand across his face, and the bronze mask disappeared.</p><p></p><p>His handsome and transcendent appearance was revealed, even with a smile that was soothing to the heart.</p><p></p><p>But the eight people across from him were shaken at this moment!</p><p></p><p>It really was him! He had truly broken the seal!</p><p></p><p>"Lu Changsheng... it's not just our Ancient Desolate Divine Sword Clan that is targeting you, why don't you go bother the other seven clans?" the Clan Leader said in a deep voice.</p><p></p><p>Lu Changsheng smiled faintly, "Don't worry, after I've destroyed your Ancient Desolate Divine Sword Clan, I'll naturally turn to them..."</p><p></p><p>As he spoke, the sword Zhanxu appeared in his hand, and he continued:</p><p></p><p>"I won't hide from you, I, Lu Changsheng, also have some understanding of the Sword Dao, I wonder how I compare to your Ancient Desolate Divine Sword Clan?"</p><p></p><p>The eight people across from him were startled to hear this, they never expected Lu Changsheng to be a sword cultivator as well!</p><p></p><p>"Lu Changsheng, in the past when we went to suppress you, our Ancient Desolate Divine Sword Clan only lost two Sword Masters, and the other seven clans also each lost two experts of roughly the same strength. Do you really think you can stir up any waves in our Divine Sword Clan today?" the Clan Leader said in a cold voice.</p><p></p><p>They were well aware of Lu Changsheng's strength, after all, fourteen Dao Realm Experts were unable to deal with him, which was something no one in the entire Eternal Celestial Domain could achieve, not even the powerful experts of the Void Ancient Beast Clan in the Heavenly Abyss Ancient Realm.</p><p></p><p>So Lu Changsheng's individual strength was truly terrifying!</p><p></p><p>But individual strength is still individual strength, and now they were on the territory of their Divine Sword Clan!</p><p></p><p>Their clan still had the existence of the Divine Sword Ancestor, who was a mid-Dao Realm expert.</p><p></p><p>"Do you think I, Lu Changsheng, have been standing still?" Lu Changsheng said expressionlessly.</p><p></p><p>The Clan Leader's face was shrouded in gloom, and he suddenly sneered, "Hehe, originally we eight clans were still discussing sending more people to find you, after all, the Eternal Life Body is truly something that makes us feel uneasy..."</p><p></p><p>Here is the full English translation of the excerpt from the Chinese novel:</p><p></p><p>"Haha...since you have come to us of your own accord, then the Immortal Longevity Body, we of the Divine Sword Clan shall gladly accept!" </p><p></p><p>Just as he finished speaking, another hunched old man appeared.</p><p></p><p>"Greetings, Venerable Ancestor!" </p><p></p><p>The crowd joyfully greeted him and hurriedly paid their respects.</p><p></p><p>To be honest, relying on them alone, suppressing Lu Changsheng would be a bit difficult, but with the Venerable Ancestor, it would be much easier.</p><p></p><p>The Divine Sword Clan's Venerable Ancestor looked at Lu Changsheng, a greedy glint flashing in his eyes, and indifferently said, "Enough with the nonsense, just directly subdue him!"</p><p></p><p>Lu Changsheng was in no hurry to make a move, as he had come all this way, he wanted to see what tricks these people had up their sleeves.</p><p></p><p>Boom!</p><p></p><p>The Divine Sword Clan's Venerable Ancestor and the others suddenly erupted with the ultimate spiritual energy, causing the entire ancient and desolate Divine Sword Clan domain to change color.</p><p></p><p>The Divine Dao Realm's oppressive aura was as heavy as a towering mountain firmly pressing down on the entire space!</p><p></p><p>Countless Divine Sword Clan's supreme talents knelt on the ground, looking at this scene in shock and terror. They looked at the youth in green robes with a question constantly circling in their hearts - on what basis?</p><p></p><p>On what basis did this person make the nine strongest of the ancient and desolate Divine Sword Clan, including the Venerable Ancestor, join forces to attack him?!</p><p></p><p>Li Shuyan, Xue Yue, Nangong Wenxin, and the others also knelt down under this oppressive aura, their hearts trembling.</p><p></p><p>The pressure of the Divine Dao Realm, even without being directed at them, was enough to make them want to kneel. Was this the peak expert of the Eternal Celestial Domain?</p><p></p><p>It was unimaginable how much tremendous pressure the youth in green robes at the forefront was bearing!</p><p></p><p>Yet, when they raised their heads to look, their souls were shaken.</p><p></p><p>The youth in green robes was still standing upright, holding his sword!</p><p></p><p>Under the suppression of the nine Divine Dao Realm experts, he seemed to be unaffected in the slightest!</p><p></p><p>Hum hum hum hum...</p><p></p><p>At this moment, faint Dao sounds permeated the sky, causing everyone to feel uncomfortable. They couldn't help but use their spiritual energy to block their ears, but to their horror, the Dao sounds were resonating in their minds.</p><p></p><p>They stared intently at the sky, and suddenly noticed that behind the nine peak experts, including the Divine Sword Clan's Venerable Ancestor, there were blurry silhouettes, like characters, but indistinct.</p><p></p><p>And behind the Divine Sword Clan's Venerable Ancestor, there were two characters - Mid-Divine Dao Realm!</p><p></p><p>"Injure him first!!"</p><p></p><p>Accompanied by the Divine Sword Clan's Venerable Ancestor's low roar, the other eight simultaneously moved, their fingers forming swords.</p><p></p><p>Terrifying and unparalleled sword intent instantly blanketed the entire space, permeating every corner!</p><p></p><p>Li Shuyan, Nangong Wenxin, and the others, as well as all the members of the ancient and desolate Divine Sword Clan, were all grievously wounded by the sword qi in the air.</p><p></p><p>...</p><p></p><p>The blurry characters above the nine seemed to be infusing strands of Dao principles into the sword intent...</p><p></p><p>The sword qi in the heavens and earth became even more turbulent!</p><p></p><p>Li Shuyan was dumbfounded, his eyes wide open, filled with worry.</p><p></p><p>He had never seen such terrifying sword intent before!</p><p></p><p>Even the sword intent displayed by the Venerable Master when he slashed at the five Eternal Dao experts in the boundless void was not as fierce as the Divine Sword Clan's today.</p><p></p><p>Venerable Master... can you withstand this?</p><p></p><p>At this moment, the nine in the sky pointed their fingers like swords and simultaneously slashed towards Lu Changsheng!!</p><p></p><p>"Swoosh swoosh swoosh‚Äî!"</p><p></p><p>Instantly, the space of the ancient and desolate Divine Sword Clan was shattered, with the deafening sword cries and tremors sweeping across the heavens and earth, extending outwards infinitely.</p><p></p><p>Nine utterly ruthless sword qi of different colors surged towards Lu Changsheng.</p><p></p><p>"Lu Changsheng, die!!"</p><p></p><p>Lu Changsheng's eyes flickered lightly...</p><p></p><p>To be honest, the assault before him was indeed the most violent he had witnessed so far.</p><p></p><p>The eight great ancient clans did have some remarkable abilities.</p>

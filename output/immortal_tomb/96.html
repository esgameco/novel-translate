        <h1>Chapter 96</h1>
        <div class="content">
            <p>Here is the full English translation of the Chinese excerpt:</p><p></p><p>Lu Changsheng called the waiter over and ordered another bowl of noodles. </p><p></p><p>After that, he picked up his chopsticks and stirred the noodles, saying, "Go ask."</p><p></p><p>The old turtle immediately understood, coughed dryly, and got up to saunter over to the neighboring table.</p><p></p><p>Soon, the old turtle was sitting on a stool next to them, under the bewildered gaze of the group.</p><p></p><p>This was something he was most adept at.</p><p></p><p>"Uh, fellow Taoist, may I ask what you are discussing?" one of the thin men asked the old turtle in surprise.</p><p></p><p>The other three also looked at the old turtle with puzzlement, frowning as they waited for his response, in case he was here to cause trouble.</p><p></p><p>"Hehe, I'm just here to ask, what is the current situation with the three great immortal clans you mentioned?" the old turtle said amiably.</p><p></p><p>Upon hearing this, the four became even more puzzled - was there anyone who didn't know about this by now?</p><p></p><p>Seeing this, the old turtle simply pushed over a high-grade spirit stone, saying, "Tell me about it."</p><p></p><p>The four people's eyes lit up, and their expressions immediately became more guarded.</p><p></p><p>"Cough, it seems you are new to our Langtian Domain, so it's understandable that you don't know about the affairs of the three great immortal clans," the thin man said calmly, while winking at the others.</p><p></p><p>"That's right!" the other three nodded in agreement.</p><p></p><p>The old turtle was secretly pleased. Indeed, as long as the money was in place, they would help you find an excuse, no matter how far-fetched - this was truly remarkable.</p><p></p><p>"Go on, tell me. As long as Grandpa Turtle is satisfied, there will be plenty of spirit stones!" the old turtle waved his hand casually.</p><p></p><p>The thin man and the others had no objection to the old turtle calling himself "Grandpa Turtle."</p><p></p><p>Their mindset was unanimous - as long as the money was in place, they wouldn't mind if he called himself "Great-Grandpa."</p><p></p><p>"Well, Grandpa... no, Fellow Taoist, the matter is a bit long, please allow me to explain in detail," the thin man said with a slightly solemn expression, and began to recount the story.</p><p></p><p>After about the time it takes to drink a cup of tea, the old turtle nodded in a somewhat puzzled manner. He gave the thin man a rather curious look - this fellow had managed to turn a matter that could be summarized in a few sentences into a tale that took a whole cup of tea to tell. But he did have a bit of the old turtle's flair.</p><p></p><p>The gist of it was that 12 years ago, the Tianhen Sect was destroyed, and the authorities came to investigate, but after a long investigation, they still found no clues. In the end, the three great immortal clans of the Langtian Domain might become the scapegoats.</p><p></p><p>In the next few days, the three great immortal clans might be called to account. The white would be forcefully turned black, so that they could go back and report the case as solved.</p><p></p><p>The place of reckoning would be the central square of Shacheng City, where the three great immortal clans would all gather.</p><p></p><p>The old turtle stood up and tossed another high-grade spirit stone over, then headed back to his seat.</p><p></p><p>"Thank you, Grandpa!" the thin man exclaimed joyfully as he caught the spirit stone.</p><p></p><p>"Hmm?" The old turtle paused and turned to look at the thin man, smiling approvingly. "You're quite a talented fellow."</p><p></p><p>With that, he tossed another high-grade spirit stone over before returning to his seat.</p><p></p><p>"Goodbye, Grandpa!" The thin man happily pocketed the spirit stones, his face flushed with excitement. Of course he was excited - three high-grade spirit stones had just fallen from the sky.</p><p></p><p>"Here, this one is for you all to share. The other two are mine," the thin man said, handing one of the spirit stones to his three companions and keeping the other two for himself.</p><p></p><p>At this time, the voice of the old turtle at the neighboring table rang out, "Waiter, the bill."</p><p></p><p>The four people looked over and saw the old turtle casually tossing a high-grade spirit stone to the bewildered waiter, then leaving with a handsome young man in blue.</p><p></p><p>This left the four people completely stunned and awestruck.</p><p></p><p>What kind of family was this? Just a few bowls of noodles, and they were throwing around high-grade spirit stones like it was nothing! One high-grade spirit stone could practically buy out the entire mortal shop, and they still had more to spare!</p><p></p><p>"Master, the three great immortal clans will be called to account in the central square of this city in the next few days," the old turtle's voice suddenly rang out.</p><p></p><p>Here is the full English translation of the Chinese excerpt:</p><p></p><p>A few days later, I'm not sure exactly how many.</p><p></p><p>[New Book Bar]</p><p></p><p>Old Turtle walked behind Lu Changsheng, respectfully saying, "Hmm, then let's go find a place near the central square and wait quietly for the trial to begin."</p><p></p><p>Lu Changsheng looked around left and right, unconcerned. "Okay."</p><p></p><p>Old Turtle respectfully responded, "Yes..."</p><p></p><p>"The questioning just now wasn't bad, at least you didn't mess it up." Lu Changsheng suddenly said.</p><p></p><p>Old Turtle's face stiffened, and he gave an embarrassed smile...</p><p></p><p>Just then, a powerful voice boomed across the Sands City!</p><p></p><p>"Three days from now, the Inspection Hall will publicly accuse the three major immortal clans in the central square of the Sands City!"</p><p></p><p>Immediately, the entire Sands City fell silent. </p><p></p><p>Countless cultivators' eyes flickered.</p><p></p><p>Lu Changsheng smiled faintly. He was curious to see how the so-called Inspection Hall would conduct this trial!</p><p></p><p>He would eventually deal with the people behind the scenes who defied the immortal rules.</p><p></p><p>...</p><p></p><p>Chu Clan Immortal Sect.</p><p>Main Hall.</p><p></p><p>Bang!</p><p></p><p>Chu Lang angrily smashed a teacup into pieces!</p><p></p><p>"The Inspection Hall is simply too outrageous!"</p><p></p><p>The elders on both sides of the hall trembled. They hadn't seen the clan leader this furious in a long time.</p><p></p><p>Chu Lang swept his gaze across the elders, his expression gloomy, his voice hoarse. "What does the destruction of the Eternal Grand Sect 12 years ago have to do with the three major immortal clans? What does it have to do with our Chu Clan? Do they really think we have that kind of power?! These envoys from the Inspection Hall are simply shameless, accusing people arbitrarily for their own interests! As the clan leader, I must report this!"</p><p></p><p>The elders listened with bitter resignation, only seeing it as the clan leader venting his anger. </p><p></p><p>To report it? Easier said than done.</p><p></p><p>Their Chu Clan was not even considered a minor sect. The higher-ups wouldn't care about the cries of insignificant ants, let alone uphold justice for them.</p><p></p><p>Even more terrifying was that even if they reported it, they might be intercepted before it reached halfway.</p><p></p><p>How realistic.</p><p></p><p>After calming his resentful emotions, Chu Lang said in a solemn voice, "Summon Chu Xiruo!"</p><p></p><p>"Yes."</p><p></p><p>Soon, the long-absent Chu Xiruo appeared in the main hall, still in her white dress, silently standing below.</p><p></p><p>"Xiruo, on the day the Eternal Grand Sect was destroyed 12 years ago, it was also the day you just happened to return. According to the route and timeline, you should have been one of the first to arrive at the scene. That day, did you really not see anything at all around the Eternal Grand Sect?"</p><p></p><p>Chu Lang sighed as he asked, truly at a loss.</p><p></p><p>Chu Xiruo's expression was blank, without the slightest change. She frowned and said, "Clan Leader, on that day, Xiruo really didn't discover anything. I only heard a thunderous roar, and then I appeared at the Eternal Grand Sect, but by then it had already been reduced to ruins..."</p><p></p><p>Chu Lang looked at her expectantly. "Can you try to recall again?"</p><p></p><p>Chu Xiruo shook her head.</p><p></p><p>Chu Lang's face immediately turned cold. "You're really no help. You were banished to the mortal realm years ago for making a mistake, and even after returning, you still haven't improved at all, and even ruined my Emerald Sea Immortal Dome!"</p><p></p><p>He was purely venting his anger at this point. He had always been dissatisfied with Chu Xiruo, and now she had conveniently become the target.</p><p></p><p>It's been 12 years since she returned, and she hasn't even called him "Father" once! This unfilial daughter!</p><p></p><p>Chu Xiruo's expression changed slightly.</p><p></p><p>The elder beside her, unable to bear it, stepped forward and said, "Clan Leader, Miss's past mistake was unintentional. Moreover, the matter is already in the past, and Miss has been punished. Please don't blame her anymore."</p><p></p><p>"Yes, Clan Leader, we all understand. Now that the family is in trouble, you're anxious, and if you want to vent, feel free to take it out on us, but don't direct it at Miss. She is innocent."</p><p></p><p>"..."</p><p></p><p>Hearing the words of the elders, Chu Lang's brow relaxed, and he looked at Chu Xiruo, gently saying, "You may leave."</p><p></p><p>Chu Xiruo bowed slightly, "Xiruo takes her leave."</p><p></p><p>After she left, Chu Lang was about to speak when a voice came from outside the hall.</p><p></p><p>"The Chen Clan and the Huang Clan, the two clan leaders have arrived!"</p>

        <h1>Chapter 288</h1>
        <div class="content">
            <p>Here is the full English translation of the Chinese excerpt:</p><p></p><p>Listening to the discussions that were like crashing waves, </p><p></p><p>the previously proud and arrogant young masters of the Miu Clan and other celestial prodigies had their faces turn rigid.</p><p></p><p>Although they were at the Spirit Origin Realm, considered quite impressive prodigies, they were still vastly inferior compared to those at the Divine Yang Realm.</p><p></p><p>As soon as the Blood Moon appeared, it crushed the aura of celestial prodigy that had been above their heads.</p><p></p><p>What is a true celestial prodigy? This is the real celestial prodigy!</p><p></p><p>With not even a million years of cultivation, they possess strength rivaling the older generation!</p><p></p><p>In the group, Fu Shiyu and the others also had some unsettled hearts.</p><p></p><p>Fu Shiyu looked at the Blood Moon, who was the center of attention, and suddenly felt a deep sense of inferiority rise up within her. As a woman like herself, why was the gap so large?</p><p></p><p>"There's no need to feel inferior. In this world, there are many who are born at the endpoint of others. Comparing yourself to them only exhausts yourself, and has no other meaning. Just focus on being the best version of yourself."</p><p></p><p>At this moment, Lu Changsheng's voice rang out in the minds of Fu Shiyu and the others.</p><p></p><p>His words seemed to carry a mysterious power, and the three of them instantly relaxed.</p><p></p><p>Fu Shiyu pursed her lips and respectfully transmitted, "Yes, senior."</p><p></p><p>Although the senior's age might not be much different from theirs, in the path of cultivation, the accomplished are revered. Addressing him as senior was completely appropriate.</p><p></p><p>Not only them, even Patriarch Liu Tu and their own fathers would have to respectfully address him as senior.</p><p></p><p>The Blood Moon and the other nine prodigies stepped back, and the crowd hurriedly made way for the Blood Moon.</p><p></p><p>But they were shocked to discover that the Blood Moon remained standing there, not leaving immediately.</p><p></p><p>The young master of the Miu Clan rolled his eyes, and with a smile, walked up to the Blood Moon and bowed, "Blood Immortal Lady, I am the young master of the Miu Clan of the Royal City. I wonder..."</p><p></p><p>"Get lost."</p><p></p><p>Before he could even finish speaking, the Blood Moon spoke indifferently, not even sparing him a glance.</p><p></p><p>The young master of the Miu Clan's smile froze on his face.</p><p></p><p>The countless strange gazes directed at him made his face burn with embarrassment, and he felt completely powerless!</p><p></p><p>"Haha... Excuse me."</p><p></p><p>The young master of the Miu Clan awkwardly cupped his hands and left this place hastily, a hint of gloom flashing in his eyes.</p><p></p><p>The news of the Blood Moon's appearance in the Royal City center spread, and more and more people gathered at the testing stone, the space becoming increasingly cramped.</p><p></p><p>Those who came upon hearing the news were mostly just wanting to catch a glimpse of the legendary Blood Moon.</p><p></p><p>"Whew, is that veiled lady in the red dress the Blood Moon? She's so beautiful, I've decided, the Blood Moon will be my goddess from now on."</p><p></p><p>"Tch, who do you think you are? What kind of weirdo dares to call himself the Blood Moon's little fan?"</p><p></p><p>"You..."</p><p></p><p>Just as the crowd was discussing,</p><p></p><p>it was finally Lu Changsheng and Fu Shiyu's group's turn to be tested.</p><p></p><p>Liu Tu and Fu Liancai immediately became nervous, their eyes fixed intently on the testing stone where Lu Changsheng stood.</p><p></p><p>More accurately, they were looking at Lu Changsheng.</p><p></p><p>Seeing that another group of prodigies were about to be tested, the crowd also quieted down. </p><p></p><p>Maintaining silence during a prodigy's testing was the most basic courtesy.</p><p></p><p>Even the Blood Moon shifted her gaze over there, not leaving immediately. She wanted to see if there were any other formidable prodigies.</p><p></p><p>This time, she must secure a spot in the top ten and become the sword servant of the Ancient Wasteland Sword Clan, because...</p><p></p><p>...</p><p></p><p>Lu Changsheng stood before the testing stone. He looked up at the towering stone, </p><p></p><p>then, just like the other prodigies, placed his palm on the stone sphere in front of him. It felt icy cold,</p><p></p><p>and there was a subtle fluctuation trying to probe into his body, likely to assess his bones.</p><p></p><p>Here is the full English translation of the Chinese excerpt:</p><p></p><p>Lu Changsheng's eyes flickered slightly as he let the fluctuations enter his mind.</p><p></p><p>"Sizzle, sizzle, sizzleâ€”"</p><p></p><p>Suddenly, the ten test stones lit up with beams of light!!</p><p></p><p>Eight yellow, one purple, and one... white!</p><p></p><p>Wow!</p><p></p><p>The center of the royal city was immediately in an uproar again!</p><p></p><p>Another supreme celestial being!</p><p></p><p>But what's the deal with that white beam of light... why is there even a Xian Emperor realm participant in the Celestial Lord Assembly...</p><p></p><p>This is the first time a white beam of light has appeared in the tests of the Celestial Lord Assembly.</p><p></p><p>Although the Xian Emperor realm can participate in the Celestial Lord Assembly, who would be so thick-faced and unafraid of death to join?</p><p></p><p>Currently, this is the first Xian Emperor realm participant...</p><p></p><p>For a moment, many gazes briefly ignored the purple beam and focused on the test stone emitting the white light.</p><p></p><p>They saw a young man in green robes standing quietly, wearing a bronze mask.</p><p></p><p>Hmph, wearing a mask, this mysterious Xian Emperor realm junior is quite intriguing!</p><p></p><p>After all, the test stones are infallible!</p><p></p><p>As for Liu Tu, Fu Liangcai, Liu Qing, and Fu Shiyu, they were dumbfounded.</p><p></p><p>What the hell?</p><p></p><p>The senior was clearly at the late-stage Celestial Yang realm, how could the test stone light up white?</p><p></p><p>However, they had no time to care about the color of the beam at the moment. Since the senior's test stone had successfully lit up, it meant that his bone age was truly under ten million years old, heavens!!</p><p></p><p>Even Blood Moon was stunned, her lips slightly parted under the veil, not even looking at the purple beam anymore.</p><p></p><p>At the same time,</p><p></p><p>The shadowy figure in the black robe in front of the purple beam test stone was almost fuming with anger!!</p><p></p><p>How could this be, he was the supreme Celestial Yang realm Celestial Lord, he should have been the most eye-catching one!</p><p></p><p>Suddenly, a little Xian Emperor realm junior appeared, stealing all his brilliance!</p><p></p><p>Hey, you all look at me! I am the Celestial Yang realm Celestial Lord, I am the Junior Master of the Assassin Tower, the Shadow!</p><p></p><p>I am a top-ranked hot shot Celestial Lord!</p><p></p><p>The crowd had no time to mock, as there was another Celestial Yang realm Celestial Lord for them to admire, and discussions soon arose:</p><p></p><p>"Whew, another Celestial Yang realm Celestial Lord, this one is completely wrapped in a black robe, we don't even know who it is!"</p><p></p><p>"Celestial Yang realm, all wrapped in black, this attire seems to be the Junior Master of the Assassin Tower!"</p><p></p><p>"The Junior Master of the Assassin Tower, the third-ranked top hot shot Celestial Lord!"</p><p></p><p>"Wow, today two top five hot shot Celestial Lords have emerged!"</p><p></p><p>"..."</p><p></p><p>Blood Moon glanced at the Shadow, her gaze flickering for a moment before disappearing with a step.</p><p></p><p>Seeing the gazes converge on him, the Shadow finally felt a little better.</p><p></p><p>He glanced at the corner of his eye at the young man in green by the white beam, his eyes flashing coldly. A Xian Emperor realm daring to steal his spotlight!</p><p></p><p>Soon,</p><p></p><p>Lu Changsheng and Fu Shiyu retreated, indifferent to the strange gazes around them.</p><p></p><p>He then left the center of the royal city with Liu Tu and the others, under countless stares.</p><p></p><p>In the following days, in the ancient Huang City, aside from Blood Moon and the Shadow who had appeared on the test stones,</p><p></p><p>The most talked about and mocked was the 'Xian Emperor realm' Lu Changsheng.</p><p></p><p>Because in this Celestial Lord Assembly so far, he was the first one to have the audacity to participate as a 'Xian Emperor realm',</p><p></p><p>Single-handedly lowering the threshold of the Celestial Lord Assembly.</p>

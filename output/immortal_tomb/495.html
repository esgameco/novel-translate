        <h1>Chapter 495</h1>
        <div class="content">
            <p>Here is the full English translation of the Chinese excerpt:</p><p></p><p>The words of Lu Changsheng fell, and the faces of the Chu clan elders had already turned deathly pale, without a drop of blood. Even in the icy and snowy land, large beads of sweat were constantly dripping from their foreheads.</p><p></p><p>As for the other eight high-ranking members, they were also dumbfounded, unable to react in the short term!</p><p></p><p>This... this was too sudden!</p><p></p><p>They had thought that this gentleman had a good relationship with the Chu clan, but who knew he would suddenly say such a thing!</p><p></p><p>It was really too sudden, let them catch their breath.</p><p></p><p>The eight high-ranking members did not immediately agree, because if they destroyed the Chu clan on Dengtiandao, the consequences would certainly be unimaginable!</p><p></p><p>It directly provoked the contradiction, and it was maximized!</p><p></p><p>But, but if they didn't agree at this moment, they would probably all die!</p><p></p><p>No, they couldn't let their friends die while they lived. The subsequent contradictions could be dealt with later!</p><p></p><p>The most important thing now was to survive first!</p><p></p><p>Soon, the eight high-ranking members, fearing that the man in the blue robe would change his mind, gritted their teeth and hurriedly said:</p><p></p><p>"Great lord! The Sword God Sect is willing to serve!"</p><p>"The Tianbat Clan is willing to serve!"</p><p>"The Nine Underworld Inferno Palace is willing to serve!"</p><p>"The Qin Clan, Li Clan, Wang Clan, and Yang Clan are willing to serve!"</p><p></p><p>"You... you all!" The Chu clan elder's eyes trembled, although he knew their choice was not wrong, but the change in their attitude was still difficult for him to accept.</p><p></p><p>The eight high-ranking members' expressions remained unchanged, without a trace of embarrassment. At their level, their skin had become extremely thick.</p><p></p><p>"Great lord, may I ask what offense has our Chu clan committed against you?"</p><p></p><p>The Chu clan elder looked at Lu Changsheng, his eyes reddened, and trembled, "Can... can you let me die with understanding?"</p><p></p><p>Lu Changsheng looked at the Chu clan elder indifferently, and there was no softening in his gaze because of the elder's appearance. He said, "Actually, you already have the answer in your heart, don't you?"</p><p></p><p>The Chu clan elder's pupils trembled, and he said hoarsely, "Chu You, it must be Chu You..."</p><p></p><p>Lu Changsheng's gaze flashed, and he then released the restrictions on the other eight high-ranking members, smiling and saying, "I've given you a chance to live, so cherish it well. Go ahead and act, I'll just stand here and watch."</p><p></p><p>Lu Changsheng's smile made the crowd shudder, and even the old turtle beside them felt a chill in their hearts.</p><p></p><p>Killing people while chatting and laughing was the most terrifying.</p><p></p><p>...</p><p></p><p>The immobilized Chu clan elder was soon killed by the eight high-ranking members.</p><p></p><p>Afterwards, the eight high-ranking members quickly ordered their subordinates to launch a massacre against the Chu clan on the island, and the subordinates of each faction, although shocked, still gritted their teeth and obeyed the order to take action.</p><p></p><p>"You, the eight factions, what is the meaning of this? Why are you attacking our Chu clan without reason!"</p><p>"May you all die!"</p><p>"Have you forgotten the rules that the nine factions established before?"</p><p>"Ah!"</p><p></p><p>The many factions near the central area heard the sound of the battle and the cries, and their expressions all changed drastically, their eyes filled with shock!</p><p></p><p>What had happened in the central area!</p><p></p><p>They could tell that the Chu clan was being attacked by the other eight factions!</p><p></p><p>Soon, the central area became quiet, the battle had ceased.</p><p></p><p>Under the joint attack of the eight factions, the Chu clan on the island could not hold out for long, and was exterminated in less than the time it takes to drink a cup of tea.</p><p></p><p>...</p><p></p><p>"Great lord, the Chu clan on the island... has been destroyed."</p><p></p><p>The eight high-ranking members bowed and said with difficulty.</p><p></p><p>Lu Changsheng nodded slightly, without saying a word, and stepped onto the old turtle that had already transformed back to its original form.</p><p></p><p>The old turtle slowly took flight and headed out, soon disappearing from their sight.</p><p></p><p>The eight high-ranking members suddenly stumbled, their bodies completely exhausted. They looked at each other, their expressions filled with a sense of barely surviving and bitterness!</p><p></p><p>"What should we do... such an event has happened."</p><p>"After all, it was us who destroyed the Chu clan on the island, the Chu clan will surely go mad with rage when they find out."</p><p>"Hmph, do we eight factions really fear the Chu clan? Even if the Chu clan goes mad, so what? I don't believe they have the guts to go to war with us eight factions!"</p><p>"That's right, we're not afraid of the Chu clan. At most, we'll have a guilty conscience."</p><p>"That gentleman used us to destroy the Chu clan, but he has also provoked the contradiction between us and the Chu clan. Sigh..."</p><p>"This matter cannot be kept hidden here..."</p><p></p><p>Here is the full English translation of the Chinese excerpt:</p><p></p><p>"There are many people outside the central domain who have heard the commotion. We should take the initiative to report this matter back, explain the reasons - we really had no choice..."</p><p></p><p>"Mm, that's the only thing we can do. Ah, the Sea of Laws is about to be stirred up by huge waves."</p><p></p><p>"Our various forces are very far from the Ascending Heaven Island. There are even areas with law and spiritual rifts along the way. By the time the news reaches them, the grand ceremony held by the Elven Tribe is probably just about to begin. This, this, this..."</p><p></p><p>"Yes, ah, worrying. The Chu Clan won't go crazy at the ceremony, will they? Looks like the Elven Tribe's grand ceremony is going to be ruined."</p><p></p><p>...</p><p></p><p>Lu Changsheng sat cross-legged on the back of the old turtle, overlooking the area below. Suddenly, he saw the two Elves, and signaled the old turtle to go down.</p><p></p><p>"My lord!"</p><p></p><p>Qing and Lin were startled and hurriedly paid their respects.</p><p></p><p>"I had previously promised to go with you to the Elven Tribe, but now I'm telling you that I won't be going with you. So you don't need to wait for me on the island," Lu Changsheng said with a smile.</p><p></p><p>"My lord, are you not going to visit our Elven Tribe?" Lin asked respectfully.</p><p></p><p>"No, I'll go, but I'll go by myself, not by boat."</p><p></p><p>Lu Changsheng finished speaking with a smile, and the old turtle rose into the air and continued towards the outside of the island.</p><p></p><p>Not by boat?!</p><p></p><p>Lin's expression changed slightly, and she quickly called out, "My lord, the airspace above the Sea of Laws is very dangerous!"</p><p></p><p>Qing also looked very anxious. As is well known, the Sea of Laws, whether below the surface or in the airspace above, is very dangerous. Ordinary cultivators recklessly going there would undoubtedly die.</p><p></p><p>But as soon as they finished speaking, Lin and Qing's expressions became embarrassed.</p><p></p><p>Damn, they forgot that their lord had mastered the Dao - he should have no problem with it.</p><p></p><p>Subsequently, Lu Changsheng rode the old turtle to the edge of the Ascending Heaven Island, where he also saw Chen Pang and Xiao Chai.</p><p></p><p>At this time, Chen Pang and Xiao Chai were sitting cross-legged on the stone cliff, earnestly comprehending the laws, naturally unaware of the figure in blue robes watching them from above.</p><p></p><p>But this place was too remote, the laws too scarce, making it extremely difficult to comprehend higher-level laws. They had no idea the Ascending Heaven Island was so gloomy before coming.</p><p></p><p>Chen Pang and Xiao Chai sighed inwardly. This trip to the Sea of Laws really was...</p><p></p><p>But it wasn't all bad either. At least they had stayed in a top-notch suite and seen the world, and even spoken with the Dao Sovereign Lord Changsheng.</p><p></p><p>All these experiences would be enough for them to boast about for a lifetime.</p><p></p><p>"Master, within the Ascending Heaven Island, the levels are clearly divided, and the good places for law comprehension have basically been monopolized. These two are here, so they are unlikely to comprehend any good laws... Ah, this trip to the Sea of Laws may have been in vain."</p><p></p><p>The old turtle rolled its eyes and said awkwardly.</p><p></p><p>Lu Changsheng looked at the old turtle with amusement, then looked down at Chen Pang and Xiao Chai, pondering for a moment before casually waving his sleeve.</p><p></p><p>Suddenly, the laws within thousands of miles around Chen Pang and Xiao Chai converged towards them!</p><p></p><p>"Let's go," Lu Changsheng said softly.</p><p></p><p>"Hehe, okay." The old turtle chuckled and turned to fly out of the island.</p><p></p><p>At the same time, Chen Pang and Xiao Chai suddenly felt the laws around them become extremely dense. Their brows furrowed, and they abruptly opened their eyes, their gazes filled with disbelief!</p><p></p><p>"Big brother, look over there!" Chen Pang suddenly pointed to the sky in front of them, exclaiming.</p><p></p><p>Xiao Chai quickly looked, and saw a familiar blue figure sitting cross-legged on a black turtle gradually disappearing into the sea of clouds, vanishing from sight.</p><p></p><p>Xiao Chai and Chen Pang's eyes trembled, their throats swallowing rapidly, and they quickly stood up, reverently bowing three times towards the direction the blue figure had disappeared into the clouds.</p><p></p><p>It turned out they had been fortunate all along. With such dense laws, as long as their aptitude and comprehension were not too poor, comprehending medium or even high-level laws was not impossible!</p><p></p><p>Once they comprehended high-level laws, they would be able to do well even in the Sea of Laws!</p><p></p><p>It turned out that ever since they boarded the Sea Transport No. 3 and met the blue-robed man, the gears of their destiny had begun to turn.</p>

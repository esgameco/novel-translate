        <h1>Chapter 74</h1>
        <div class="content">
            <p>Here is the full English translation of the Chinese excerpt:</p><p></p><p>"Tsk, whether I and the master return is none of your business. Since the master said he will send you back, then he will send you back. Don't ask about anything else."</p><p></p><p>The old turtle withdrew his finger and frowned.</p><p></p><p>Regarding the old turtle's hostile attitude, Chu Xiran slightly furrowed her brows. They were all people from the Four Directions Immortal Realm, and now they were stranded in the lower realm together. Why be like this?</p><p></p><p>However, she also restrained herself from saying anything, after all, she still needed to work together with this master-servant pair later. It's better to be on good terms.</p><p></p><p>And most importantly, she vaguely felt that this master-servant pair was a bit stronger than her!</p><p></p><p>Just then, Gu Helin suddenly opened his eyes, panting heavily, and anxiously said,</p><p></p><p>"M-Master, Helin's tribulation lightning seems to be coming again! What should we do!"</p><p></p><p>At the same time!</p><p></p><p>Rumble—!</p><p></p><p>In the sky outside the Nameless Restaurant of the Tianrun Merchant Association, dark clouds began to gather, and muffled thunder boomed!</p><p></p><p>At this moment, countless cultivators in the Tianrun Merchant Association stared blankly at the sky, dumbfounded.</p><p></p><p>Which cultivator was so daring to dare undergo a tribulation in the Tianrun Merchant Association?? How much loss would the lightning strike cause, and wasn't this slapping the Tianrun Merchant Association in the face?</p><p></p><p>They truly had no fear of inviting their own destruction!</p><p></p><p>Even if they succeeded in weathering the tribulation, they might still be executed by the Tianrun Merchant Association.</p><p></p><p>"Wow, the tribulation clouds are above the Nameless Restaurant, it seems the cultivator undergoing the tribulation must be inside the Nameless Restaurant!"</p><p></p><p>"Impressive, impressive, not only daring to undergo a tribulation in the Tianrun Merchant Association, but also in the Nameless Restaurant. Is he trying to have the restaurant struck by lightning?"</p><p></p><p>"Let's go take a look!"</p><p></p><p>"..."</p><p></p><p>In an instant, many cultivators rushed towards the vicinity of the Nameless Restaurant, their eyes shining with excited curiosity.</p><p></p><p>After all, this was the first time they had seen a cultivator dare to undergo a tribulation in the Tianrun Merchant Association.</p><p></p><p>Tianrun Merchant Association headquarters.</p><p></p><p>In the luxurious building, a fat, middle-aged man with a large head and ears looked gravely at the tribulation clouds above the Nameless Restaurant, his tone somewhat cold,</p><p></p><p>"Good, there is actually a cultivator daring to undergo a tribulation in my merchant association. How interesting."</p><p></p><p>"Quickly, go guard the area of the tribulation. Once this person weathers the tribulation, execute him on the spot!"</p><p></p><p>"Yes, Chairman!" a respectful voice sounded outside.</p><p></p><p>.........</p><p></p><p>Chu Xiran looked at the flushed-faced Gu Helin speechlessly. You say you drank so much Cyan Sea Immortal Liquor in one go for what?</p><p></p><p>In the end, he even underwent a tribulation in her restaurant...</p><p></p><p>Chu Xiran sighed, about to speak up and have the restaurant's patrons leave, lest they get caught in the crossfire.</p><p></p><p>"Just a small tribulation for advancing to the mid-Nascent Soul stage, not as serious as the previous Four-Nine Tribulation. Why are you so nervous?"</p><p></p><p>Lu Changsheng looked at the fidgeting Gu Helin, frowning slightly, and said.</p><p></p><p>Hearing this, Gu Helin bitterly smiled.</p><p></p><p>Master, you are you, and I am me!</p><p></p><p>Chu Xiran heard this and was also slightly surprised. Blue-robed friend, the person is only at the Nascent Soul stage, right? Being a little afraid is quite normal, especially since this tribulation can only be weathered by him alone...</p><p></p><p>Tribulations, no matter where they occur, even in the Four Directions Immortal Realm, are the same. No one can interfere! This is an established principle!</p><p></p><p>Even in the Four Directions Immortal Realm, the four Immortal Emperors of the four directions dare not meddle in the affairs of the Heavenly Dao, because the Heavenly Dao of the Four Directions Immortal Realm is extremely powerful, this is well-known.</p><p></p><p>And the Heavenly Dao also has organization and consciousness. If you dare to interfere with its affairs, it will summon the help of other Heavenly Daos.</p><p></p><p>Although this is just the Heavenly Dao of the lower realm, Chu Xiran dares not to meddle, unless she wants to spend the rest of her life being chased by the Heavenly Dao, constantly experiencing the sensation of being struck by lightning, which is not a pleasant experience, and to be honest, she can't even defeat this Heavenly Dao...</p><p></p><p>Every Heavenly Dao is the collective power of an entire world, and they are extremely powerful!</p><p></p><p>In the Spiritual Dust Realm, this is the domain of the Spiritual Dust Heavenly Dao!</p><p></p><p>Just as Chu Xiran was lost in thought, Lu Changsheng said indifferently,</p><p></p><p>"Old Turtle, Gu Helin is not suitable to undergo the tribulation today. Go up and drive him away, let him come back another time."</p><p></p><p>"Okay!"</p><p></p><p>The old turtle obeyed the order and disappeared in a flash.</p><p></p><p>"Huh... Drive him away, come back another time..." Chu Xiran forced herself to not understand, but her pupils shrank.</p><p></p><p>Lu Changsheng smiled gently and pointed upwards, saying:</p><p></p><p>Here is the full English translation of the Chinese excerpt:</p><p></p><p>"So this is the heavenly tribulation, isn't it?" </p><p></p><p>"Fellow Daoist, please don't joke around..." Chu Xirou forced a smile and continued, "I've already sent word to the servants, telling the guests to leave the tavern."</p><p></p><p>Lu Changsheng poured himself a drink and said indifferently, "Do as you please, but there's no need for that."</p><p></p><p>Gu Helin heaved a long sigh, then naturally stood up and bowed respectfully, "Thank you, sir."</p><p></p><p>Last time when he was going through the forty-nine-day tribulation, the sir had helped protect his Fa, so he naturally understood some of the sir's methods. Driving away the heavenly tribulation today might actually be possible.</p><p></p><p>Moreover, the sir's personality was not the type to boast.</p><p></p><p>Seeing that Gu Helin had actually believed the words of the man in green, Chu Xirou momentarily didn't know what to say.</p><p></p><p>Subsequently, with a wave of her hand, the grand formation of mountains and rivers dissipated!</p><p></p><p>The ominous clouds in the sky became clearly visible.</p><p></p><p>She was curious to see how the tribulation would be driven away.</p><p></p><p>Rumble—!</p><p></p><p>Dark clouds filled the sky, lightning flashed and thunder roared, as if the terrifying thunderbolts were about to descend at any moment.</p><p></p><p>Under this majestic celestial might, the many cultivators who had gathered around the nameless tavern were trembling with fear, instinctively moving even further away, afraid of being struck by the tribulation.</p><p></p><p>Layer upon layer, the space was exceptionally crowded. It could be said that the vast majority of the cultivators from the Tianyun Trading Company had gathered here.</p><p></p><p>"Make way, the Tianyun Trading Company is handling this!"</p><p></p><p>At this moment, two elders, accompanied by many cultivators in uniform attire, entered the scene.</p><p></p><p>The crowd immediately recognized these cultivators as being from the Tianyun Trading Company!</p><p></p><p>Their gazes grew increasingly excited,</p><p></p><p>It seems that after the cultivator has weathered the tribulation, he will be dealt with by the Tianyun Trading Company...</p><p></p><p>"Look, the cultivator has appeared!"</p><p></p><p>Suddenly, a cultivator pointed excitedly at the sky and shouted.</p><p></p><p>Everyone was startled and looked up!</p><p></p><p>"Huh, is this the cultivator who summoned the tribulation? When did he appear? I've been watching the sky the whole time, how did I not notice him?"</p><p></p><p>"Yes, I didn't notice him either, it's as if he just appeared out of thin air!"</p><p></p><p>"Whew, could he be a Nascent Soul Venerable? If that's the case, the Tianyun Trading Company will have to think carefully."</p><p></p><p>"Definitely not, based on the intensity of this tribulation, I guess the cultivator in the sky must be an Elixir Patriarch."</p><p></p><p>"An Elixir Patriarch, that's still very powerful."</p><p></p><p>"..."</p><p></p><p>The cultivators discussed among themselves.</p><p></p><p>As for the people from the Tianyun Trading Company, they were quite displeased. They stared intently at the figure in the sky, their eyes flashing with a fierce expression.</p><p></p><p>If this person were to safely weather the tribulation on their turf today and not die, their Tianyun Trading Company would undoubtedly become a laughingstock!</p><p></p><p>In the sky, the old turtle stood with his hands on his hips, looking at the vast tribulation clouds and grinning widely,</p><p></p><p>"Little tribulation, quickly disperse before you incur the wrath of Grandpa Turtle!"</p><p></p><p>The tribulation clouds paused for a moment, then continued to churn, the thunderbolts becoming even more violent!</p><p></p><p>The old turtle was dumbfounded, and then a flash of embarrassment rose in his eyes. This damned Heavenly Dao actually didn't give him any face?</p><p></p><p>Not only him, but the cultivators below were also stunned, then quickly covered their mouths to stifle their laughter! If the one in the sky were just at the Gold Core stage, they would have burst out laughing long ago.</p><p></p><p>Good grief, they heard what? This cultivator was telling the tribulation clouds to disperse?!</p><p></p><p>Heavens, how dare he? Could it be that he had gone mad?</p><p></p><p>Feeling the numerous strange gazes from below, the old turtle slowly clenched his fists, even wanting to smash the sky to vent his anger. But then he thought of Lu Changsheng, and a shiver went through him, reluctantly suppressing the embarrassment in his heart.</p><p></p><p>He pointed at the sky and shouted, "Hmph! You useless thing, you may not give Grandpa Turtle any face, but if you don't give face to my master, you better be prepared to get beaten!"</p><p></p><p>In just a moment, the tribulation clouds dispersed, and the thunderbolts stopped, giving the impression that they had fled.</p><p></p><p>The old turtle took a deep breath, hating this stupid Heavenly Dao to the core!</p><p></p><p>He was not afraid of the master, as the master was invincible, but he, the old turtle, was also very strong, okay?!</p><p></p><p>The old turtle didn't notice that all the cultivators below, and even the entire Tianyun Trading Company, were gaping in astonishment, their jaws dropped to the ground.</p><p></p><p>Many mocking smiles had frozen on their faces.</p><p></p><p>In the tavern, Chu Xirou and Gu Helin also had their pupils dilated...</p><p></p><p>The world fell silent, without a single sound.</p>

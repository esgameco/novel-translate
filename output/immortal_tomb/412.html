        <h1>Chapter 412</h1>
        <div class="content">
            <p>Here is the full English translation of the Chinese excerpt:</p><p></p><p>"The character of the Ninth Prince is well known throughout the ancient kingdom of Yunlan. How could Father bear to exchange the happiness of his remaining life for the future of the Zhu family?"</p><p></p><p>Zhu Qingqing spoke calmly, without anger or any other emotion.</p><p></p><p>Upon hearing this, Zhu Guyuan's brow furrowed. The character of the Ninth Prince was indeed rotten, and rotten to the core, known by all.</p><p></p><p>But the Ninth Prince was the king's most beloved prince after all!</p><p></p><p>So Zhu Guyuan said indifferently, "While the Ninth Prince's conduct still has room for improvement, his status, position, and power are at least far beyond that of a mere musician!"</p><p></p><p>"Putting aside the Ninth Prince's conduct, his every other quality is top-notch!"</p><p></p><p>Zhu Qingqing looked deeply at Zhu Guyuan, then turned and left the hall without another word.</p><p></p><p>"Qingqing..." </p><p></p><p>Zhu Mother reached out and called, but her hand fell powerlessly, her eyes red as she said, "Guyuan, this is tantamount to pushing Qingqing into the fire. Isn't our Zhu family doing well and safely in Tianxiang City? Why must you gamble with Qingqing's happiness?"</p><p></p><p>Saying that, she left without regard for the changing expression on Zhu Guyuan's face.</p><p></p><p>Zhu Guyuan stood there, his gaze flickering, muttering, "Qingqing, blame your father if you will, but our Zhu family's time is running out... However, the Ninth Prince is still a hundred, a thousand times better than a mere musician."</p><p></p><p>...</p><p></p><p>In the ancient kingdom of Yunlan, in the capital city.</p><p></p><p>Within the royal palace.</p><p></p><p>Accompanied by palace maids and eunuchs, the Ninth Prince Yun Aoye moved through the magnificent palace, soon arriving outside a splendid palace.</p><p></p><p>Outside the palace gates, two armed guards saw the Ninth Prince approaching and were startled, quickly stepping forward to salute.</p><p></p><p>Yun Aoye first waved away the palace maids and eunuchs behind him, then smiled faintly at the two guards:</p><p></p><p>"Please inform the king that Aoye requests an audience."</p><p></p><p>Hearing this, the two guards exchanged a glance, inwardly conflicted.</p><p></p><p>The king was currently resting, and normally anyone seeking an audience would be turned away. But the one requesting was the king's most beloved Ninth Prince...</p><p></p><p>"The Ninth Prince, please wait a moment."</p><p></p><p>After hesitating briefly, one of the guards bowed and went into the palace.</p><p></p><p>Soon, the guard emerged from the palace, respectfully saying, "The Ninth Prince, please enter."</p><p></p><p>Yun Aoye smiled smugly, then straightened his attire and strode into the palace.</p><p></p><p>...</p><p></p><p>As soon as Yun Aoye entered the luxurious palace, he saw a middle-aged man rubbing his temples.</p><p></p><p>The middle-aged man wore a golden robe, his square face imposing even at rest, exuding a powerful aura just by sitting there.</p><p></p><p>This was the supreme emperor of the ancient kingdom of Yunlan, Yun Zecang.</p><p></p><p>Yun Aoye knelt down, respectfully saying, "Father, your son Aoye has disturbed your rest."</p><p></p><p>Yun Zecang looked up at Yun Aoye, revealing a slight smile. "Hehe, no matter, rise."</p><p></p><p>Yun Aoye inwardly relaxed, then slowly stood up and came to stand behind Yun Zecang, massaging his shoulders, not saying anything for the moment.</p><p></p><p>Yun Zecang closed his eyes, enjoying this moment of peace, and said with a hint of a smile, "Ye'er, tell me, what mischief are you up to this time?"</p><p></p><p>This was what Yun Aoye had been waiting for, so he replied with a smile, "Father, your son wishes to go to the capital city for a visit."</p><p></p><p>Hm?</p><p></p><p>Yun Zecang opened his eyes, glancing sideways at Yun Aoye, and said indifferently, "What, the capital city isn't enough for you to play in?"</p><p></p><p>Yun Aoye hesitated.</p><p></p><p>Yun Zecang feigned a touch of anger. "Quit stalling and just say it!"</p><p></p><p>Yun Aoye flinched, then honestly said, "Zhu Guyuan of the Zhu family in Tianxiang City has introduced his daughter to me, and I wish to go take a look..."</p><p></p><p>Hearing this, Yun Zecang's brow raised, and he said impatiently, "Another woman? Aoye, you..."</p><p></p><p>Here is the full English translation of the Chinese excerpt:</p><p></p><p>"Is there only women on your mind?" </p><p></p><p>Although Yunze Cang had no impression of Tianxiang City, after all, the ancient country of Yunlan had too many big and small cities, and he had never even heard of what was called the Zhu府 or Zhu故原. But he quickly grasped the key point.</p><p></p><p>Yun Ao Xie suddenly dared not to speak. To say in this ancient country of Yunlan, the one he feared the most was his father the King, and the second most was the Qin Saint Ye Xun Wang who was on good terms with his father.</p><p></p><p>Seeing that Yun Ao Xie did not dare to speak, Yunze Cang said:</p><p></p><p>"Xie'er, do you think why would that Tianxiang City's府 want to properly introduce their daughter to you?"</p><p></p><p>Yun Ao Xie said in a low voice, "Of course Your Servant knows, the ultimate goal is nothing more than wanting to use Your Servant's power to have a place in the capital."</p><p></p><p>As the Ninth Prince, although Yun Ao Xie's conduct was not upright, he was obsessed with women, but having grown up in the palace, he naturally understood the thoughts of those people.</p><p></p><p>But there's nothing he can do, it's the women that make him unable to move forward.</p><p></p><p>Yunze Cang's expression softened a bit, "So? Do you still want to go to that Tianxiang City? Aren't there enough women in the capital for you to play with?"</p><p></p><p>Yun Ao Xie said cautiously, "Father, actually this matter is only secondary, the main thing is that Your Servant really wants to go out of the capital to wander around......"</p><p></p><p>Otherwise, he wouldn't have gone to Tianxiang City in person, it would have been more convenient to just let Zhu故原 send his daughter to the capital.</p><p></p><p>Yunze Cang pondered for a moment, and finally sighed helplessly, "Do as you please, but if this King finds out that you are causing trouble and harming good families outside..."</p><p></p><p>"Cough cough, Father, don't worry, Your Servant is not that kind of person!" Before Yunze Cang could finish, Yun Ao Xie excitedly patted his chest.</p><p></p><p>Yunze Cang snorted, then said, "As the Ninth Prince of our Yunlan Country, you must pay attention to your safety when you go out..."</p><p></p><p>"Father, don't worry, Your Servant will bring the most capable subordinates." Yun Ao Xie hurriedly said.</p><p></p><p>"Hmm." Yunze Cang nodded.</p><p></p><p>At this moment, a middle-aged man in a black robe suddenly appeared in the main hall, startling Yun Ao Xie a bit, but he quickly exclaimed joyfully, "Uncle Ye!"</p><p></p><p>The middle-aged man in black robe, with a scholarly and elegant demeanor, seemed to be a great master, and there seemed to be a musical rhythm slowly revolving around him.</p><p></p><p>This person was the Qin Saint of Yunlan, Ye Xun Wang!</p><p></p><p>"Hehe, little brother." </p><p></p><p>Not only did Yunze Cang not blame Ye Xun Wang for his abrupt appearance, but he even stood up and welcomed him with a smile.</p><p></p><p>Ye Xun Wang returned a salute, then smiled faintly and said, "Your Majesty, I also happened to want to go out for a stroll, why don't I accompany Ao Xie this time?"</p><p></p><p>Hearing this, Yunze Cang smiled: "Excellent!"</p><p></p><p>With Ye Xun Wang there, Ao Xie's safety would be absolutely guaranteed.</p><p></p><p>Yun Ao Xie's smile, however, became a bit stiff...</p><p></p><p>It's not that it's not good, it's just that with Uncle Ye there, he won't be able to freely do as he pleases, he will definitely be under supervision...</p><p></p><p>Seeing the expression on Yun Ao Xie's face, Yunze Cang's gaze immediately sharpened, and he sternly said:</p><p></p><p>"Hmm? What is this expression? Having Your Uncle Ye accompany you is a blessing for you!"</p><p></p><p>"Ah yes yes yes, Father, you misunderstood, with Uncle Ye, of course Your Servant is overjoyed! Perhaps on the way, if Uncle Ye is in the mood, Your Servant may even have the honor of hearing the heavenly music."</p><p></p><p>Yun Ao Xie hurriedly flattered.</p><p></p><p>Yunze Cang's expression finally eased a bit, looking at the quiet Ye Xun Wang, he smiled and said, "Brother, I entrust Ao Xie to you."</p><p></p><p>Ye Xun Wang gently cupped his hands, an air of pride flashing across his face: "Your Majesty, rest assured, with me here, no one in this ancient country of Yunlan can harm Ao Xie."</p>

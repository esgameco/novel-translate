        <h1>Chapter 467</h1>
        <div class="content">
            <p>Here is the full English translation of the Chinese excerpt:</p><p></p><p>Is there another among the He Clan?</p><p></p><p>The crowd was startled, but at the moment they had no time to think further, as the suppression from the great formation was becoming increasingly stronger...</p><p></p><p>Gradually, gradually, all the people were completely suppressed in place by the great formation!</p><p></p><p>Including the two Shen Kongboundary experts Hongwanjun and Ouyang Mo, everyone found it difficult to take even a single step!</p><p></p><p>The entire venue was filled with dense figures, petrified like stone.</p><p></p><p>Lu Changsheng looked up at the top of the Tianxiang Tower, his gaze flickering slightly. He was not at all anxious, for he knew that the refinement had not even begun, and even if it had, there was no need to hurry.</p><p></p><p>"Hehe hehe hehe..."</p><p></p><p>Suddenly, a cold laughter rang out in everyone's ears, making them alert!</p><p></p><p>The next moment, a figure plummeted from the top of the Tianxiang Tower like a cannon shell!!</p><p></p><p>Boom!!</p><p></p><p>The moment it hit the ground, the ground immediately split into four and five pieces, with dust and smoke billowing!</p><p></p><p>When the dust settled, the crowd looked closely and their pupils suddenly shrank, their hearts trembling greatly!</p><p></p><p>Lying there, in a life-or-death state, was an old woman - </p><p></p><p>It was actually... the He Clan Chief!</p><p></p><p>The clan chief of the He Clan was now lying in front of them like a vegetable, bringing a tremendous shock to them!</p><p></p><p>The many high-level ancient clan chiefs present had their hearts pounding violently, an indescribable fear rising in their hearts!</p><p></p><p>Except for Ouyang Mo and the others, Hongwanjun and the rest finally understood the seriousness of the situation at this moment!</p><p></p><p>They also vaguely understood what Ouyang Mo had previously said about "another among them".</p><p></p><p>Now, the He Clan...</p><p></p><p>Just then, a figure stood out at the top of the Tianxiang Tower, looking down at all those present from above!</p><p></p><p>The crowd looked up at the sound, and saw a figure wrapped in a black robe. For some reason, the sight of this black-robed person made their hearts start to beat.</p><p></p><p>Lu Changsheng scrutinized the black-robed person for a moment, his eyes revealing no emotion.</p><p></p><p>At the top of the Tianxiang Tower, the black-robed person swept his gaze over the crowd below and said indifferently:</p><p></p><p>"Today, I wish to refine the Myriad Worlds Calamity Body, so I thank you all, you insignificant insects, for your assistance..."</p><p></p><p>Below, Hongwanjun shouted: "I said the He Clan wanted to refine the Myriad Worlds Calamity Body, not caring about the entire Hollow Ancient Realm's opposition. So they were actually controlled by you! Who are you?!"</p><p></p><p>The black-robed person sneered, "The He Clan's desire to refine the Myriad Worlds Calamity Body is real, what control? I... have only given a little push, since the He Clan couldn't control the devil in their hearts."</p><p></p><p>Hongwanjun still wanted to say something, but the black-robed person waved his hand:</p><p></p><p>"Enough, I have no time to waste words with you insignificant insects. Since you have entered the Refining Heaven Formation, even the gods cannot save you."</p><p></p><p>Saying that, the black-robed person suddenly raised his hand, and the previously dormant Refining Heaven Formation began to shake again!</p><p></p><p>And outside the sight of the crowd, the countless blood mists that had permeated the area after the previous battle were being drawn in like magnets, rushing into the Refining Heaven Formation.</p><p></p><p>As these countless blood mists filled in, the blood-colored patterns and beams of the Refining Heaven Formation became even more dazzling!!</p><p></p><p>An indescribably thick bloody aura permeated the space, filling everyone's nostrils!</p><p></p><p>A terror that could not be described instantly spread through everyone's hearts!</p><p></p><p>The crowd stared in horror at the black-robed person, wondering what he was going to do...</p><p></p><p>"Star Master!! Ouyang Ming did not treat you as an enemy, but even helped bring them into the He Clan. Why... why are you targeting us as well?!"</p><p></p><p>At this time, Ouyang Mo, feeling his life was in grave danger, turned pale and shouted in question.</p><p></p><p>"Star Master, please show mercy!"</p><p></p><p>Suddenly, Hongwu Jue also pleaded urgently.</p><p></p><p>This scene made Hongwanjun and Ye Zhuiyue pause for a moment.</p><p></p><p>Hongwanjun looked at Hongwu Jue beside him in disbelief: "Wujue, what do you mean?!"</p><p></p><p>Hongwu Jue fell silent, gritting his teeth, the veins on his neck bulging.</p><p></p><p>Hongwanjun and the others felt their minds shaken, and they also understood - well, it turned out that Hongwu Jue, as the clan chief of the Hong Clan, had also been used as a pawn by the black-robed person beforehand?</p><p></p><p>"A bunch of insignificant insect chatter!"</p><p></p><p>The black-robed person's hand movements did not stop, and he sneered, "What kind of existence am I, and what kind of existence are you insects? Also..."</p><p></p><p>Here is the full English translation of the Chinese excerpt:</p><p></p><p>"Dare to question me? To me, you are nothing more than pigs and dogs that have been penned up, and I will decide your life and death!!"</p><p></p><p>At this moment, it seemed that the blood qi in the great formation had reached its peak intensity. The man in the black robe suddenly made a hand seal and looked up, staring at the blood-red markings and shouting:</p><p></p><p>"Using the Void Ancient Realm as the furnace, and the living beings of this realm as the catalyst, I shall forge my Myriad Worlds Calamity Body, activate the Heaven-Sealing Formation, begin!!!"</p><p></p><p>Boom!!!</p><p></p><p>As the man in the black robe finished speaking, a blood-red aura rapidly spread out from the center of the Heaven-Sealing Formation of the Heavenly Tribe.</p><p></p><p>This blood-red aura enveloped the entire Void Ancient Realm!</p><p></p><p>All the myriad things in the Void Ancient Realm instantly turned into a pure blood-red color under the crimson glow in the sky.</p><p></p><p>The countless lower-tier ancient tribes were all horrified, staring at the blood-red sky and the transformed world, not understanding what was happening, only knowing that a deep unease filled their hearts.</p><p></p><p>A world of blood-red, as if the end of the world had arrived!</p><p></p><p>...</p><p></p><p>The Heavenly Tribe.</p><p></p><p>The people had been numbed by this commotion, never having seen such blood-red and evil before.</p><p></p><p>At the same time, they also realized that the man in the black robe in front of them was a terrifying existence, not someone from the Qiankun Heavens.</p><p></p><p>No one dared to speak here, each of them trapped in a state of terror.</p><p></p><p>And the Heaven-Sealing Formation seemed to be gradually interfering with their emotions, making them anxious and desperate.</p><p></p><p>Everyone felt as if they knew their own fate - to be refined by the man in the black robe.</p><p></p><p>They had come here to stop the forging of the Myriad Worlds Calamity Body, but never imagined that they would end up being the ones refined.</p><p></p><p>Seemingly affected by the Heaven-Sealing Formation, Ye Zhuiyue's breathing became more and more rapid. He glanced sideways at Lu Changsheng and transmitted a voice:</p><p></p><p>"Elder Lu... I've implicated your Ye Clan."</p><p></p><p>At this moment, even Ye Zhuiyue, a powerful expert on the verge of stepping into the Half-Step Divine Realm, had been suppressed to the point where he could barely turn his head, with only his eyes able to blink with difficulty.</p><p></p><p>But the next moment, Ye Zhuiyue's peripheral vision was shocked to see the young man in blue robes calmly walking towards him and standing in front of him, giving him a meaningful look before suddenly turning around.</p><p></p><p>Ye Zhuiyue and the other Ye Clan disciples who witnessed this scene felt extremely suffocated!</p><p></p><p>What did they see?</p><p></p><p>Everyone had been suppressed, so how could Elder Lu still be able to stroll leisurely?</p><p></p><p>On the top of the Celestial Pavilion, the man in the black robe suddenly sneered, "Lu Changsheng, have you finally couldn't hold back?"</p><p></p><p>"I've actually noticed you a long time ago, but unfortunately, the Heaven-Sealing Formation has now been fully activated. Lu Changsheng, no matter how capable you are, it's useless. Do you regret it?"</p><p></p><p>The man in the black robe's sudden words left the crowd puzzled.</p><p></p><p>But the trapped He Xitong, her brain suddenly shaken, as the two precious lifetimes of memories surged in her mind.</p><p></p><p>In one lifetime, he was the kind-hearted elder brother who had changed her life with just a few words.</p><p></p><p>In one lifetime, he was the teacher who had taught her the art of saving lives.</p><p></p><p>The usually strong and fearless He Xitong, whose eyes gradually turned red, her body trembling. She desperately tried to turn her head to look outside, wanting to see who it was... but her body was completely restrained.</p><p></p><p>Lu Changsheng? At this moment of confusion, the crowd was stunned to see a young man in blue robes rise up, striding towards the Celestial Pavilion...</p><p></p><p>It was him!</p><p></p><p>Hong Wuyu and the other high-ranking ancient tribe elders stared at the young man in blue robes with trembling eyes!</p><p></p><p>The Ye Clan's revered elder?!</p><p></p><p>Lu Changsheng, with his hands behind his back, looked at the man in the black robe and said indifferently, "Regret? I just wanted to see what this great formation would do after it was fully activated... but it has only disappointed me."</p><p></p><p>Hearing this, the man in the black robe's gaze under the black robe narrowed slightly.</p><p></p><p>And in the crucible of the formation, He Xitong suddenly heard that voice from the depths of her memories, as if it was engraved in her bones. She was stunned.</p>

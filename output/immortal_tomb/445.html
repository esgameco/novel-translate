        <h1>Chapter 445</h1>
        <div class="content">
            <p>Here is the full English translation of the Chinese excerpt:</p><p></p><p>The old turtle's eyes flickered, and he pursed his lips, not daring to speak.</p><p></p><p>Ye Xunmang was also frightened by Lu Changsheng's aura and dared not speak. After all, the usually kind and gentle Qingyi gentleman had suddenly changed his expression, which was extremely oppressive.</p><p></p><p>Just a minor demon?</p><p></p><p>In the darkness, Zhao Kun and the other two were stunned, and their eyes looking at Lu Changsheng became infinitely terrified!</p><p></p><p>The old man at the Spirit Void Realm actually called this Qingyi gentleman his master?</p><p></p><p>To have a Spirit Void Realm expert as a servant, this person must be...</p><p></p><p>"Uncle, we should leave quickly..." </p><p></p><p>Zhao Gao trembled as he transmitted his voice.</p><p></p><p>At this moment, in his heart, the Thousand-Tentacle Demoness was suddenly not as terrifying anymore.</p><p></p><p>More terrifying was that Qingyi cultivator!</p><p></p><p>"Let's go!" Zhao Kun and Zhao Yuan hurriedly nodded, not daring to stay any longer.</p><p></p><p>Just as the three were about to flee, a zither suddenly appeared in front of Lu Changsheng, and he casually plucked a string with one hand.</p><p></p><p>"Twangâ€”!"</p><p></p><p>A sound of the zither that seemed to tear the heavens and earth erupted!</p><p></p><p>Among those present, only Ye Xunmang was horrified to see the surging waves of sound rushing towards the Thousand-Tentacle Demoness with infinite lethality!</p><p></p><p>The Thousand-Tentacle Demoness sensed the deadly danger, her expression changed drastically, and she looked at Lu Changsheng in terror before fleeing towards the abyss, no longer caring about the equally bewildered old turtle.</p><p></p><p>The old turtle also wanted to run!</p><p></p><p>Because Lu Changsheng's attack had even locked onto him!</p><p></p><p>Boom!</p><p></p><p>The invisible sound waves arrived in an instant, like a fierce beast from the primordial era. The sound waves were like the sharpest blades in the world, and in an instant, they had shredded the massive Thousand-Tentacle Demoness into countless pieces, not even allowing her to let out a scream before she vanished.</p><p></p><p>The old turtle's shell was instantly pierced with countless holes. Although the shell managed to block the attack, the tremendous force still struck the old turtle hidden inside, causing him to fall unconscious.</p><p></p><p>This huge commotion could be sensed by the other bizarre creatures in the abyss, and they all trembled in fear, not daring to come to this place.</p><p></p><p>In the darkness, Zhao Kun and the other two were deathly pale, their pupils trembling, and their souls shaking, as if they had witnessed the most terrifying thing in the world.</p><p></p><p>Lu Changsheng waved his hand, and the turtle shell flew towards Ye Xunmang, who hurriedly embraced it, then continued to stare blankly.</p><p></p><p>Lu Changsheng put away the zither and looked calmly at the space where Zhao Kun and the others were hiding.</p><p></p><p>"Come out."</p><p></p><p>Zhao Kun and the others shuddered violently, and after exchanging a glance, they tremblingly revealed themselves. When they came before Lu Changsheng, they immediately knelt down without a word.</p><p></p><p>Zhao Kun swallowed hard and said in a trembling voice, "Great... Great Lord, we heard the commotion and came to observe. I swear, we have no ill intentions..."</p><p></p><p>Zhao Gao and Zhao Yuan were kneeling there, not daring to make a sound.</p><p></p><p>Zhao Gao now hated his sister in his heart. If she hadn't insisted on coming to join the excitement, they might not have ended up risking their lives here.</p><p></p><p>Zhao Gao knew that a Qingyi cultivator of this caliber would treat their lives as insignificant as ants.</p><p></p><p>If the Qingyi cultivator wanted to kill them, it would be as easy as crushing insects.</p><p></p><p>At this time, Ye Xunmang snapped out of his daze, exhaling a breath of fear. He then noticed the three cultivators kneeling in front of Lu Changsheng.</p><p></p><p>When did they...?</p><p></p><p>Suddenly, Ye Xunmang's gaze became puzzled, for some reason, he saw a familiar figure in the leading elder, a faint sense of familiarity.</p><p></p><p>Seeing that Lu Changsheng remained silent, Zhao Kun became increasingly anxious. Reacting quickly, he introduced himself:</p><p></p><p>"I am Zhao Kun, and the two young ones behind me are Zhao Gao and Zhao Yuan. We are from the Zhao Clan of the Donghsu Ancient Realm."</p><p></p><p>"Old Zhao?!" Ye Xunmang suddenly looked at Zhao Kun in astonishment.</p><p></p><p>Huh?</p><p></p><p>Zhao Kun was taken aback, and he instinctively looked up, seeing Ye Xunmang, and then he was stunned: "Old... Old Ye?"</p><p></p><p>"Old Zhao, is it really you?"</p><p></p><p>Here is the full English translation of the Chinese excerpt:</p><p></p><p>"It's you!" Ye Xunwang was first surprised, but then he sensed something amiss and quickly bowed to Lu Changsheng respectfully, saying, "M-My lord, this person was my childhood friend in the Donghuxu Ancient Realm..."</p><p></p><p>"Mm." Lu Changsheng nodded slightly, then turned and entered the palanquin.</p><p></p><p>Zhao Kun and the others heaved a long sigh of relief, silently thanking their lucky stars!</p><p></p><p>It's a good thing they had an acquaintance here! </p><p></p><p>Otherwise, they couldn't be sure this noble gentleman in blue wouldn't just slap them to death.</p><p></p><p>"Old Ye, you're not..." </p><p></p><p>Zhao Kun stood up with Ye Xunwang's support, looking at him in disbelief, wanting to say more but hesitating.</p><p></p><p>"Uncle Ye." Zhao Gao and Zhao Yuan also greeted Ye Xunwang, though they didn't have much impression of him, but since he was a childhood friend of their clan uncle, his status must not be low.</p><p></p><p>It's just that his strength... how could it be so much lower than their clan uncle's, only at the peak of the Shenwu Realm?</p><p></p><p>Ye Xunwang shook his head, not daring to keep Lu Changsheng waiting, so he smiled bitterly and said, "Let's talk as we walk."</p><p></p><p>...</p><p></p><p>The palanquin was shuttling through the heavenly abyss, moving quickly and making a lot of noise, but no more sinister beings dared to cause trouble.</p><p></p><p>"I see, I roughly know what's going on now," Zhao Kun said thoughtfully after listening to Ye Xunwang's explanation.</p><p></p><p>Zhao Gao and Zhao Yuan stood there awkwardly, glancing at the figure behind the curtain from time to time, shivering.</p><p></p><p>It was truly too exciting and nerve-wracking to be traveling with such a mysterious and powerful figure.</p><p></p><p>"What's going on?" Ye Xunwang asked Zhao Kun puzzledly.</p><p></p><p>Zhao Kun sighed first, then said solemnly, "Old Ye, you should know the He Clan, right?"</p><p></p><p>The He Clan?</p><p></p><p>Ye Xunwang immediately nodded. Of course he knew the He Clan, it was a super ancient clan in the Donghuxu Ancient Realm!</p><p></p><p>So Ye Xunwang asked curiously, "Does this have something to do with the He Clan?"</p><p></p><p>"Yes, old Ye, you don't know this, but the He Clan has produced a Millennium Calamity Body!" Zhao Kun said gravely.</p><p></p><p>A Millennium Calamity Body?!</p><p></p><p>Ye Xunwang abruptly stood up, asking in alarm, "What level of Millennium Calamity Body?"</p><p></p><p>A Millennium Calamity Body could be at two extremes - one that has completed the Millennium Calamity, and one that has not yet started or not completed it.</p><p></p><p>If it was a Millennium Calamity Body that had completed the Millennium Calamity, that would be a mature Millennium Calamity Body, which would be terrifying.</p><p></p><p>Zhao Kun shrugged, smiling wryly, "Given the commotion, what do you think?"</p><p></p><p>A mature Millennium Calamity Body?!</p><p></p><p>Ye Xunwang's eyes were shaken as he said, "So it's a mature Millennium Calamity Body?"</p><p></p><p>How did the He Clan manage to let the Millennium Calamity Body grow under the watchful eyes of all the other ancient clans?</p><p></p><p>And now that the Millennium Calamity Body has matured, what can be done? The He Clan has already directly crushed all the ancient clans in the Donghuxu Ancient Realm and established a hegemonic position!</p><p></p><p>Zhao Kun sighed, "The mature Millennium Calamity Body is just the trigger in this incident. Do you know what the He Clan is planning?"</p><p></p><p>"What plan?" Ye Xunwang asked in alarm.</p><p></p><p>"I heard that the Millennium Calamity Body was brought back by the He Clan from the outside world, and now the He Clan's ancestor wants to refine it... Of course, we ancient clans don't agree!" Zhao Kun said angrily.</p><p></p><p>"What? Refine the Millennium Calamity Body?!" Ye Xunwang finally understood the seriousness of the situation.</p><p></p><p>How dare the He Clan refine the Millennium Calamity Body!</p><p></p><p>It was not out of sympathy for the Millennium Calamity Body, but because the impact of refining the Millennium Calamity Body would bring irreversible damage to the heavens and earth!</p><p></p><p>This was a matter of the vital interests of all of them!</p><p></p><p>In the palanquin, Lu Changsheng was like an ancient abyss, calm and unflustered, as if everything was under his control.</p>

        <h1>Chapter 419</h1>
        <div class="content">
            <p>Here is the full English translation of the excerpt from the Chinese novel:</p><p></p><p>At this moment, the stirring sound of the zither did not stop.</p><p></p><p>In the high sky of Tianxiang City, dark clouds gathered, and muffled thunder rumbled.</p><p></p><p>In the Youting Lake, huge waves surged, like wild beasts charging.</p><p></p><p>Under this anxious divine might, the city's residents not only did not fear, but their spirits became extremely excited.</p><p></p><p>The zither sound that resounded between heaven and earth was so passionate and heart-stirring!</p><p></p><p>After a while, the zither sound stopped, and the strange phenomenon dissipated.</p><p></p><p>The Youting Lake and the entire Tianxiang City fell into a long silence.</p><p></p><p>Guo Xiong and the others were already dumbfounded!</p><p></p><p>Yun Aoye looked at the ancient zither in front of Ye Xunwang, and its strings had already been completely broken. He also tightened his lips dryly, feeling extremely thirsty in his throat...</p><p></p><p>Yun Aoye had never seen Ye Shu's zither skills being defeated, let alone such a complete defeat, which was very appropriate to describe as "body without complete skin."</p><p></p><p>After all, the zither is the second life of the zither master, and the strings were all broken.</p><p></p><p>In the distant courtyard,</p><p></p><p>Lu Changsheng was holding the score with his right hand, reading it intently, while his left hand slowly left the ancient zither in front of him...</p><p></p><p>This scene seemed to suggest that Lu Changsheng had just been looking at the score, and then heard the zither sound from outside, and casually responded with his left hand.</p><p></p><p>No emotion, just pure technique.</p><p></p><p>"Ahem, the master is drinking tea."</p><p></p><p>The old turtle coughed dryly and poured a cup of tea, respectfully handing it over.</p><p></p><p>...</p><p></p><p>Outside the Youting Lake, it was still quiet.</p><p></p><p>Although the people were looking at the distant courtyard with eager eyes, their hearts were surging and unable to be suppressed, but at this moment, the Zither Saint seemed to still be in a daze, and they did not dare to make a noise.</p><p></p><p>The city residents had already guessed who the player in the courtyard was. In this Tianxiang City, who else could it be but the Zither Immortal?</p><p></p><p>The city residents were excited beyond description. Indeed, the Zither Immortal's zither skills were unbeatable!</p><p></p><p>Even the Zither Saint who came from the capital city was no match for the Zither Immortal's skills!</p><p></p><p>The city residents could also see that even the zither strings were broken, so the zither skills must be far inferior...</p><p></p><p>Whew!</p><p></p><p>Thinking about it is terrifying.</p><p></p><p>The city residents were excited, but they also began to worry.</p><p></p><p>The Zither Immortal's superb zither skills are good, but the Ninth Prince and the Zither Saint are high in status and power. This is tantamount to slapping them in the public, and they don't know if this act will anger them.</p><p></p><p>If it angers them, the Zither Immortal may have a hard time dealing with the aftermath.</p><p></p><p>At the same time, Guo Xiong and the others were crouching nervously, carefully sensing the emotions of Yun Aoye and Ye Xunwang.</p><p></p><p>At this moment, Ye Xunwang regained his senses, straightened his body, and put away the broken ancient zither.</p><p></p><p>"Uncle Ye... we..."</p><p></p><p>Yun Aoye had not finished speaking when Ye Xunwang gave him a sharp look, and Yun Aoye dared not say more.</p><p></p><p>Ye Xunwang took a light breath, and then, in the astonished gaze of Yun Aoye and the shocked crowd, he cupped his hands and bowed respectfully towards the courtyard, saying sincerely:</p><p></p><p>"Sir, I am Ye Xunwang. May I have the honor of a conversation with you?"</p><p></p><p>Seeing this scene, Guo Xiong and the steward Yuguang exchanged a glance, their faces turning pale with worry, and their hearts were bitterly speechless.</p><p></p><p>It's over, it's over. They've hit a super steel plate.</p><p></p><p>However, fortunately, the traces of their actions have been carefully considered, so they hope the other party has not noticed.</p><p></p><p>"Creak~"</p><p></p><p>At this time, the courtyard gate opened, and the old turtle appeared. He raised his eyebrows and looked down on Ye Xunwang, saying:</p><p></p><p>"The master has rested and does not receive visitors."</p><p></p><p>After saying that, the old turtle closed the courtyard gate.</p><p></p><p>Ye Xunwang paused, sighed, but his gaze remained firm.</p><p></p><p>As for all the other people, they were shocked!</p><p></p><p>The Zither Saint, a person of such high status, was rejected with such an attitude!</p><p></p><p>Guo Xiong and the steward were stunned, and a trace of barely perceptible joy appeared in their eyes!</p><p></p><p>This Zither Immortal, relying on his superior skills, dares to look down on the Zither Saint and the Ninth Prince, being shameless!</p><p></p><p>He even sent an old servant to come out, which is simply not taking Yun Aoye and Ye Xunwang seriously at all!</p><p></p><p>In other words, this is no different from courting death?</p><p></p><p>After all, in this world, zither skills are ultimately zither skills. No matter how superb they are, martial arts are still supreme!</p><p></p><p>Indeed, Yun Aoye's face suddenly turned gloomy!</p><p></p><p>This person's contempt and arrogance are no longer just words, it's almost the same as slapping the royal family's face!</p><p></p><p>Uncle Ye, who is on equal terms with the father king, actually...</p><p></p><p>Here is the full English translation of the Chinese excerpt:</p><p></p><p>The character had already been so humble and respectful towards the elders, yet he was actually rejected by an old servant?? </p><p></p><p>And this old servant, upon seeing the mighty Ninth Prince of the Yun Lan Ancient Kingdom, did not even show the slightest courtesy!</p><p></p><p>Outrageous, simply outrageous!</p><p></p><p>If even a servant could be so arrogant, how arrogant must the master be? Yun Ao Xie did not even dare to imagine!</p><p></p><p>"Bring them here!!" </p><p></p><p>Yun Ao Xie waved his hand and shouted.</p><p></p><p>"Yes, sir!"</p><p></p><p>The four capable subordinates that Yun Ao Xie had brought along immediately bowed in response.</p><p></p><p>Seeing this, everyone's hearts tightened as they grew worried for the Qin Immortal.</p><p></p><p>But Guo Xiong and the estate manager were secretly delighted, their gazes burning with anticipation.</p><p></p><p>Ye Xun Mo's eyes narrowed slightly as he calmly said, "Ao Xie, what are you going to do?"</p><p></p><p>Yun Ao Xie bowed and said in a solemn voice, "Uncle Ye, this person relies on his qin skills and is arrogant, daring to look down upon Uncle Ye, and has even failed to show any respect for the Yun Lan Royal House...!"</p><p></p><p>"Stand down," Ye Xun Mo interrupted dismissively before Yun Ao Xie could finish.</p><p></p><p>Disbelief flashed in Yun Ao Xie's eyes. "Uncle Ye, you..."</p><p></p><p>But Ye Xun Mo simply closed his eyes and said no more.</p><p></p><p>"Creak~"</p><p></p><p>Suddenly, the door to the distant courtyard opened again, drawing everyone's attention. The old tortoise slowly hobbled out, his gaze fixed on Yun Ao Xie as he said in a low voice:</p><p></p><p>"My master has never liked killing. You all would do best not to provoke him without cause."</p><p></p><p>"Otherwise, the consequences... will be dire!"</p><p></p><p>At these words, the expressions of the surrounding people became incredibly tense...</p><p></p><p>Yun Ao Xie paused, and then his face turned as black as ink!! </p><p></p><p>"You...!!"</p><p></p><p>Yun Ao Xie was about to angrily point his finger when he was suddenly struck down by a palm from Ye Xun Mo.</p><p></p><p>The four subordinates were stunned, quickly supporting the unconscious Yun Ao Xie as they led him away, feeling somewhat at a loss.</p><p></p><p>"Take the Ninth Prince to rest," Ye Xun Mo said indifferently.</p><p></p><p>"Yes, sir."</p><p></p><p>Thereafter, Yun Ao Xie was escorted away by the disappointed Guo Xiong and the others towards the Prefect's Mansion. </p><p></p><p>As for the commoners by the lakeside, after witnessing such an earth-shattering event, they dared not linger any longer and hurriedly departed.</p><p></p><p>Soon, the crowded Yuhuan Lake courtyard was left with only the old tortoise and Ye Xun Mo facing each other in silence.</p><p></p><p>The old tortoise looked at Ye Xun Mo for a moment and said, "You are quite a clever one."</p><p></p><p>Ye Xun Mo seemed unwilling to converse further with the old servant, simply cupping his hands and saying, "I shall come visit the elder again."</p><p></p><p>He then cast a deep look at the quiet courtyard before turning to leave.</p><p></p><p>"Do you look down on Grandpa Turtle?" </p><p></p><p>Suddenly, the old servant's voice sounded from behind Ye Xun Mo.</p><p></p><p>Ye Xun Mo's gaze suddenly turned grave, his body stiffening, for he had not even detected how this unremarkable and unpleasant old servant had suddenly appeared behind him! </p><p></p><p>This could only mean one thing - this nameless old servant was extremely powerful, more so than himself!!</p><p></p><p>At that moment, Ye Xun Mo caught a glimpse of an old hand suddenly pressing down on his shoulder from behind!</p><p></p><p>Immediately, a terrifying burst of immense force erupted at his shoulder!!</p><p></p><p>Ye Xun Mo's eyes widened in shock, and he tried to resist, but he was firmly pinned down by the palm.</p><p></p><p>His knees gradually bent, and he finally dropped heavily to the ground!</p><p></p><p>Ye Xun Mo's face turned pale, and he began to pant heavily, his body trembling uncontrollably.</p><p></p><p>"What qualifications do you have to look down on your Grandpa Turtle?" </p><p></p><p>came the mocking words from behind.</p><p></p><p>Ye Xun Mo opened his mouth, his expression utterly dry, and he dared not reply, afraid that even a single wrong word would reduce him to dust.</p><p></p><p>"Brew some tea."</p><p></p><p>At that moment, a magnetic voice rang out in the courtyard.</p><p></p><p>Suddenly, Ye Xun Mo felt the immense force on his shoulder dissipate, and he staggered forward in relief.</p><p></p><p>Narrowly escaping death, Ye Xun Mo turned to look, and he could barely see the terrifying old servant slinking away towards the courtyard.</p><p></p><p>Thinking of the one in the courtyard, Ye Xun Mo's breathing became heavy.</p><p></p><p>In the remote and obscure Yun Lan Ancient Kingdom, there was actually such a formidable figure hidden away. </p><p></p><p>It was fortunate that he had earlier stopped Yun Ao Xie, or else provoking such a great personage would have brought ruin not only to himself, but to the entire royal house of the kingdom.</p>

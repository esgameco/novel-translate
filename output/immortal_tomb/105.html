        <h1>Chapter 105</h1>
        <div class="content">
            <p>Here is my translation of the Chinese excerpt you provided:</p><p></p><p>"According to the clues, this is the place. üíô‚ôûÔºñ‚ûàùî∞ùê°ùïå‰πÇ.cÔºØÁà™üêô‚òü"</p><p></p><p>The two bronze-badge inspectors looked at the Sand City ahead, exchanged a glance, then disappeared from the spot.</p><p></p><p>Soon they appeared in the central square of the Sand City.</p><p></p><p>"It's the inspectors!"  </p><p>"The Inspection Hall has come again."</p><p>"There will be a good show, but with just these two bronze-badge inspectors, it's just sending food over..."</p><p></p><p>The square immediately became restless.</p><p></p><p>The two inspectors' ears were filled with all kinds of discussions, and they frowned tightly.</p><p></p><p>Without even asking, they already knew the general truth of the matter through the many words.</p><p></p><p>In short, 12 years ago, the Eternal Grand Sect was destroyed by a mysterious man in blue, and 12 years later, the five inspectors were killed by that same man in blue when they went to the Langtiandomain to accuse the three major immortal clans!</p><p></p><p>"You! Come out!"</p><p>The inspector casually looked at someone and shouted.</p><p></p><p>"Two, two Inspectors, I don't know what you are calling me for?" </p><p>A cultivator in the Tribulation Transcendence stage tremblingly came before them and asked respectfully.</p><p></p><p>"Where are the bodies of the five inspectors? And where did the perpetrator go?"</p><p>The inspector asked directly.</p><p></p><p>The cultivator's expression was conflicted, hesitant to speak.</p><p></p><p>Seeing this, the inspector became impatient, raising a finger and shouting, "Forget it, then we'll just soul search."</p><p></p><p>"No! Two Sirs, that senior in blue is in the Chu Immortal Clan! As for the five Inspectors... their bones are gone..." The Tribulation Transcendence cultivator hurriedly said, frightened.</p><p></p><p>Bones gone?!</p><p>The two inspectors' expressions changed slightly, slapping the ink-like Tribulation Transcendence cultivator to death with a palm, then flashing away.</p><p></p><p>The restless square was left behind.</p><p></p><p>At the same time, outside the Sand City, the two inspectors immediately sent a message to Zhao Tianyuan:</p><p></p><p>"Master Tianyuan, we have found the perpetrator who killed Miss Zhao Ling, and he is the same person who destroyed the Eternal Grand Sect 12 years ago. He is currently in a small immortal clan, I think it's called the Chu Immortal Clan!"</p><p></p><p>"Oh? The same person? Very good, you two quickly go to that Chu Immortal Clan, first keep an eye on them so they don't run away when they hear the news. That person must be a great Celestial, don't act rashly, just wait for me to arrive!"</p><p>Zhao Tianyuan's cold voice sounded from the other side.</p><p></p><p>"Yes!"</p><p></p><p>"What about Ling's remains?"</p><p></p><p>"None... no remains."</p><p></p><p>After a long time,</p><p></p><p>"Mm."</p><p></p><p>...</p><p></p><p>Chu Immortal Clan, luxurious manor.</p><p></p><p>Chu Lang and the other two were standing with their bodies bent, silent. They had been waiting in the manor for a long time.</p><p></p><p>The next moment, Lu Changsheng appeared before them, but they had not detected him.</p><p></p><p>"You don't need to worry, since this matter arose because of me, I won't leave until it's properly handled."</p><p></p><p>It was not until Lu Changsheng spoke that Chu Lang and the others were startled.</p><p></p><p>"Greetings, senior!"</p><p>Huang Zhong and Chen He bent their waists even lower, while Chu Lang directly knelt down, terrified.</p><p>After all, the legendary Primal Celestial Lord.</p><p></p><p>"Mm." Lu Changsheng nodded slightly, knowing the thoughts of these three small clan leaders.</p><p></p><p>"Senior, this is the fine wine I've brought for you..."</p><p>"Senior, this is our..."</p><p>Soon, Chu Lang and the others each presented the gifts they had prepared.</p><p></p><p>Lu Changsheng smiled and said, "Keep the wine, take the rest back."</p><p></p><p>Chu Lang heard this and was delighted. "Okay."</p><p></p><p>But Huang Zhong and Chen He's expressions were awkward, their sidelong glances at Chu Lang full of displeasure, as if they had lost their mother.</p><p></p><p>Damn it, how is it that whether it's the old servant or the senior's preferences, they are all grasped so clearly by this Chu Lang.</p><p></p><p>Lu Changsheng took a stack of wine jars from Chu Lang's hand, turned and walked inside, saying as he did, "You can go down first, they're coming."</p><p></p><p>Coming? Who's coming?</p><p></p><p>Chu Lang and the others looked at each other, but immediately became solemn.</p><p></p><p>The Inspection Hall!</p><p></p><p>"Senior, please help us three immortal clans, the Inspection Hall is such a huge force, we really can't resist them!"</p><p>Huang Zhong hurriedly pleaded.</p><p></p><p>Here is the full English translation of the Chinese excerpt:</p><p></p><p>"No problem, my old servant is enough to handle this." </p><p></p><p>After saying this final sentence, Lu Changsheng disappeared.</p><p></p><p>Is this real or not? The people from the Inspection Palace this time must be more powerful than the previous five inspectors. Can the senior servant really handle them?</p><p></p><p>Huang Zhong and Chen He were unsure, but Chu Lang was not too worried.</p><p></p><p>"You two, go and sit in the main hall for a while, I'll go find Senior Turtle."</p><p></p><p>Chu Lang said solemnly and hurried away.</p><p></p><p>But at this moment, a faint voice suddenly sounded outside the Chu Clan Immortal Tribe,</p><p></p><p>"The Transcendent Immortal who killed my five inspectors from the Inspection Palace... come out for me!"</p><p></p><p>The countless disciples of the Chu Clan Immortal Tribe were all terrified, the Inspection Palace had come knocking...</p><p></p><p>The three of Chu Lang, Huang Zhong, and Chen He shuddered, and they looked back at the luxurious manor in unison, their eyes flickering as they soared into the sky.</p><p></p><p>Outside the Chu Clan Immortal Tribe.</p><p></p><p>Zhao Tianyuan stood arrogantly in the void, his expression slightly cold.</p><p></p><p>The two inspectors behind him lowered their heads and remained silent.</p><p></p><p>"Chu Lang (Huang Zhong, Chen He) greets the Inspection Use Lordship!" </p><p></p><p>At this time, three figures gradually appeared in front of Zhao Tianyuan, bowing and calling out.</p><p></p><p>They saw the silver badge on the waist of the middle-aged man in the lead, and their hearts turned icy cold.</p><p></p><p>The Silver Badge Inspector...</p><p></p><p>"Enough nonsense, I'll settle accounts with you three small immortal tribes later. Where is that Transcendent Immortal? Let him come out."</p><p></p><p>Zhao Tianyuan waved his hand indifferently.</p><p></p><p>At the same time,</p><p></p><p>Inside the Chu Clan Immortal Tribe, the old turtle was being dressed by the two sisters, trembling.</p><p></p><p>"Cough, you two beauties, don't think that old Turtle's time is so limited, it's completely because of this annoying Inspection Palace coming, disrupting old Turtle's mood."</p><p></p><p>The old turtle's face flushed slightly red, coughing dryly, speaking somewhat irritably.</p><p></p><p>"Senior, you don't need to explain, we understand." The two sisters said solemnly.</p><p></p><p>Seeing this, the old turtle rolled his eyes, looking out at the situation, a surge of anger welling up. His lifetime of glory!</p><p></p><p>"Alright, let old Turtle go out and teach a lesson to these pesky flies!"</p><p></p><p>The old turtle tossed an exquisite spirit stone into the ample bosom of the sisters, then flashed and disappeared.</p><p></p><p>"Sister, the Inspection Palace has come, what should we do...."</p><p></p><p>At this moment, the younger sister was no longer as focused on the exquisite spirit stone, as their life and death was unknown.</p><p></p><p>The elder sister shook her head slightly, "I hope this Senior Turtle has a way."</p><p></p><p>The younger sister sneered, "Sister, you're thinking too much. He can't even handle matters between men and women, so his strength must not be much either. He's just going to embarrass himself."</p><p></p><p>The elder sister: "But Senior Turtle said he was nervous."</p><p></p><p>The younger sister: "Hmph, when men can't perform, they always say they were nervous."</p><p></p><p>.........</p><p></p><p>"Now even random cats and dogs dare to come provoke the master? Go ask your Inspection Palace Patriarch, does he dare!"</p><p></p><p>Outside the Chu Clan Immortal Tribe, the old turtle appeared with a gloomy face, he was very displeased right now.</p><p></p><p>"Senior Turtle!" The three of Chu Lang were slightly delighted, quickly greeting him.</p><p></p><p>Zhao Tianyuan paused, sneering coldly: "That Transcendent Immortal is your master? Since when did a dog dare to face me directly?"</p><p></p><p>Suddenly, the old turtle unhesitatingly stretched out a palm towards the opposing Zhao Tianyuan, his five fingers abruptly spreading open!</p><p></p><p>A mighty force suddenly descended upon the heavens and earth, causing the entire world to tremble!</p><p></p><p>Before the crowd could be shocked,</p><p></p><p>A dark green beam of light erupted from the old turtle's palm, violently shooting out like a deadly scythe towards Zhao Tianyuan!</p><p></p><p>The surrounding space seemed unable to withstand it, layer after layer peeling away!</p><p></p><p>"You, you, you!"</p><p></p><p>Zhao Tianyuan's cold smile turned to terror, he looked at the hunchbacked old man in front of him with shock.</p><p></p><p>Is this really a servant?</p><p></p><p>Sizzle sizzle sizzle!</p><p></p><p>The dark green beam suddenly swept past Zhao Tianyuan's three people, leaving them frozen in place, their expressions blank!</p><p></p><p>The old turtle put away his palm, indifferently saying, "Even if your Turtle Grandpa is just a dog, he is still countless times stronger than you insignificant insects."</p><p></p><p>The heavens and earth fell silent for a moment, and the next instant, the bodies of Zhao Tianyuan's three people were torn into countless pieces, as if they had been sliced by countless knives, with countless body fragments falling into the void.</p><p></p><p>As they fell halfway, they exploded into nothingness with a bang.</p>

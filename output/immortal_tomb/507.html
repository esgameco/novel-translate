        <h1>Chapter 507</h1>
        <div class="content">
            <p>Here is the full English translation of the Chinese excerpt:</p><p></p><p>The Venerable Great Dao.</p><p></p><p>Hunhui and the others stared at Lu Changsheng in shock for a long time, and once they regained their senses, they had no time to think about anything else. A mysterious guidance led them to kneel down in a daze, as if their minds had gone blank.</p><p></p><p>It was the Reincarnation Demon Child who was dumbfounded, his mouth gaping open, and he asked, "Big Brother, are you telling the truth?"</p><p></p><p>Lu Changsheng did not respond, but instead placed his hand on the Reincarnation Demon Child's head and said, "How about I take you with me to purge the worms on the Creation Pillar?"</p><p></p><p>The Reincarnation Demon Child's eyes lit up with joy, and he looked up slightly, "Good... good!"</p><p></p><p>"I'll let you live a little longer, and after we've purged the worms, I'll kill you," Lu Changsheng said with a smile.</p><p></p><p>"Good... good! Thank you, Big Brother, thank you!!" The Reincarnation Demon Child had no objections, and was even so excited that tears glistened at the corners of his eyes.</p><p></p><p>Lu Changsheng smiled slightly, and with a wave of his hand, the radiant Great Dao Demon-Subduing Tower appeared, and he said meaningfully, "I am, in fact, the master of this Great Dao Demon-Subduing Tower."</p><p></p><p>The Reincarnation Demon Child was stunned, and he looked up at Lu Changsheng, sniffing.</p><p></p><p>Ah, so that's how it was...</p><p></p><p>In fact, the Reincarnation Demon Child had hated the master of the Great Dao Demon-Subduing Tower in the past.</p><p></p><p>Because the master had once imprisoned him in the tower, and he had wasted so much time!</p><p></p><p>He could have devoured countless worlds and become powerful, and then quickly returned to the Creation Pillar.</p><p></p><p>But at this moment, the Reincarnation Demon Child no longer hated, nor dared to hate.</p><p></p><p>In addition to the awe of Lu Changsheng's identity,</p><p></p><p>More importantly, he said he would take him along to purge the monsters!</p><p></p><p>The Reincarnation Demon Child naturally had the utmost respect.</p><p></p><p>"Great Dao Venerable, Hunhui does not know what the Creation Pillar is, nor what those monsters are, but since it concerns the endless void, how can it be the affair of the Great Dao Venerable alone? Hunhui... requests to fight!"</p><p></p><p>Hunhui suddenly clasped his fists to his forehead and bowed respectfully.</p><p></p><p>He finally understood why, from the first time he met Lu Changsheng, he had an indescribable sense of familiarity and an irrepressible feeling of awe!</p><p></p><p>It turns out... it all makes sense!</p><p></p><p>"The Four Great Spirit Generals (Thirty-Six Demons) request to fight!"</p><p></p><p>Immediately afterwards, the high-ranking members of the Soul Realm also respectfully shouted.</p><p></p><p>The Reincarnation Demon Child watched this scene, his eyes trembling deep within.</p><p></p><p>Although he knew that Hunhui and the others were doing it for the sake of the entire endless void, it was also a way to help him take revenge, and he could not help but be moved.</p><p></p><p>He deeply understood how powerful those monsters were!</p><p></p><p>Those monsters were not only individually strong, but their numbers were also terrifying, and they were spread across the Creation Pillars!</p><p></p><p>And what he had seen before was only the monsters on one of the Creation Pillars.</p><p></p><p>The Reincarnation Demon Child had once heard those monsters say that the eight Creation Pillars of the endless void had all been invaded by them... so one can imagine the number of monsters on the eight Creation Pillars...</p><p></p><p>Thinking of the terrifying scene, the Reincarnation Demon Child gritted his teeth.</p><p></p><p>In fact, even if he went with the Big Brother, the Reincarnation Demon Child had no confidence at all, none whatsoever.</p><p></p><p>Lu Changsheng glanced at Hunhui and the others, pondering.</p><p></p><p>"Big... Big Brother, the monsters on the Creation Pillar are really, really strong, you... you..." The Reincarnation Demon Child couldn't help but speak out of selfishness.</p><p></p><p>Lu Changsheng's brow furrowed slightly. Of course he knew that the monsters from the endless void were strong.</p><p></p><p>Lu Changsheng lowered his head and looked at the Great Dao Demon-Subduing Tower slowly rotating in his palm, and smiled, "No matter how strong they are, I will destroy them. As the Lord of the Great Dao, all things revere me."</p><p></p><p>Here is my translation of the Chinese excerpt you provided:</p><p></p><p>"Regardless of the danger, it is my duty," he said firmly.</p><p></p><p>The Reincarnation Demon Child paused for a moment, then slowly nodded his head.</p><p></p><p>"The Dao Venerable is righteous!"</p><p></p><p>Hunhui and the others bowed their heads slightly, their shoulders trembling.</p><p></p><p>Lu Changsheng put away the Demon-Subduing Tower and looked at Hunhui, smiling, "We're old friends, so you can all stand up now."</p><p></p><p>"We dare not!" Hunhui said tremblingly.</p><p></p><p>"I'm telling you to stand up, so stand up," Lu Changsheng said again.</p><p></p><p>Hunhui and the others then slowly rose, but no longer dared to look directly at Lu Changsheng.</p><p></p><p>Lu Changsheng observed Hunhui for a moment, then gently nodded, "When the time comes, bring your Four Great Spirit Generals and come with me. As for you all... you can stay in the Soul Realm."</p><p></p><p>Towards the end, Lu Changsheng looked at the Thirty-Six Evils.</p><p></p><p>"Dao Venerable... we!!" The Thirty-Six Evils trembled, speaking with difficulty.</p><p></p><p>"Shut up!! How dare you defy the Dao Venerable's orders! After returning to the Soul Realm, go to the Soul Slaughter Platform and accept your punishment!!" Hunhui suddenly roared.</p><p></p><p>The Thirty-Six Evils immediately lowered their heads, their hearts filled with bitterness that could not be expressed.</p><p></p><p>Going to the Soul Slaughter Platform for punishment, although it was painful, they didn't mind. What they really wanted was to go fight at the Creation Pillar!</p><p></p><p>"Your strength is still lacking a bit," Lu Changsheng said gently.</p><p></p><p>The Thirty-Six Evils understood the meaning, and deeply bowed.</p><p></p><p>"Hunhui, the punishment is not necessary. If you dare to punish them, I will deal with you first," Lu Changsheng said lightly.</p><p></p><p>Hunhui forced a smile, not daring to say anything more.</p><p></p><p>"Hunhui, you all can return to the Soul Realm and stand by. I have some matters to attend to, and I'll call for you when I'm done."</p><p></p><p>After saying this, Lu Changsheng gradually disappeared.</p><p></p><p>"Respectfully seeing off the Dao Venerable!"</p><p></p><p>In this void space, only the Reincarnation Demon Child and Hunhui were left.</p><p></p><p>"Soul Emperor, may I first return to the Soul Realm with you all? I'll wait for the senior to come back together with you."</p><p></p><p>The Reincarnation Demon Child suddenly said.</p><p></p><p>Hunhui glanced at him and shouted, "Of course you can, but if you cause any trouble, don't blame this emperor for dealing with you!"</p><p></p><p>The Reincarnation Demon Child smiled and said mockingly, "You can deal with me? Even if you fuse all your Soul Realm clones into your main body, you still can't kill me. I've got you figured out!"</p><p></p><p>Hunhui was startled, not expecting the Reincarnation Demon Child to know about his clones!</p><p></p><p>Indeed, among the many Soul Realms, not only did the Soul Emperor have clones, but the Four Great Spirit Generals, the Thirty-Six Evils, and the Seventy-Two Calamities also had clones.</p><p></p><p>In order to stabilize the order of the Soul Realm, the clones were not allowed to be fused. </p><p></p><p>But now, with the Endless Void in imminent danger, and the Dao Venerable, the highest authority in the Endless Void, leading the way, he was no longer afraid of anything!</p><p></p><p>He must fuse the clones, only by fusing them would he be the true Soul Realm Emperor!</p><p></p><p>But speaking of which, this Reincarnation Demon Child is so powerful, and he also comes from the Creation Pillar, so the races on the Creation Pillar side must be extremely powerful as well.</p><p></p><p>And yet, they were also invaded by those monsters!</p><p></p><p>Thinking about it made him shudder.</p><p></p><p>"Then follow this emperor back to the Soul Realm. I warn you, during this period, this emperor and the Nightmare Demons will fuse our clones, so you better not cause any trouble, or else the Dao Venerable..."</p><p></p><p>"Alright, don't worry. You don't need to use the senior to threaten me."</p><p></p><p>"......"</p><p></p><p>At the same time, Lu Changsheng's consciousness moved, crossing many star systems, and before him was a shining star, the familiar Ancestral Heaven Divine Realm.</p><p></p><p>This time, he had only one thing to do.</p><p></p><p>Bring the Myriad Worlds Calamity Body.</p>

        <h1>Chapter 382</h1>
        <div class="content">
            <p>Here is the full English translation of the Chinese excerpt:</p><p></p><p>This calm and indifferent remark was like a thunderclap!</p><p></p><p>It caused a tremor in the minds of all the tribes in heaven and earth, and their bodies felt a strange numbness.</p><p></p><p>The people from the Xiaoyao Sect and others in the crowd were stunned, for this voice was so familiar. Their gaze followed the countless shaking lines of sight towards the small figure in blue robes standing with hands behind his back at the very front.</p><p></p><p>Instantly, they were overjoyed - it was indeed the Sect Master!</p><p></p><p>Their hearts had initially been tumultuous and flustered, but upon seeing Lu Changsheng's figure, they immediately calmed down.</p><p></p><p>"Hehe, what are you? Go, kill him! Capture that Lu Nan, I want to make his life worse than death!!"</p><p></p><p>Shenlo roared from the back of the crowd of tribes, his cold eyes glaring at Lu Changsheng.</p><p></p><p>The more arrogant this person was, the more it would annoy him.</p><p></p><p>In the God-Demon Battlefield over the years, when had they ever seen someone so overbearing?</p><p></p><p>"Kill!!"</p><p></p><p>The crowd of tribes surged forward, blotting out the sky in an instant.</p><p></p><p>Seeing this, Lu Changsheng's expression remained unchanged as he extended his hand, and a broken sword appeared in it - this was the Zhan Xu sword that had once been broken and not yet repaired.</p><p></p><p>"Humans, retreat!" </p><p></p><p>Lu Changsheng's single shout halted the human race, and then, amidst countless dazed gazes, he raised the broken sword towards the surging horde of powerful tribal experts...and slashed down.</p><p></p><p>In that instant, the heavens and earth fell silent...</p><p></p><p>The next moment, a sword cry that tore the eardrums resounded, shaking the space!</p><p></p><p>The moment this sword cry rang out, the faces of the tribal experts changed!</p><p></p><p>Even Ao Xingbi and the others had expressions of shock on their faces.</p><p></p><p>Even Jian Wuxue, the Sword Sovereign, was stunned and stared in awe at the figure in blue robes!</p><p></p><p>He was skilled with the sword and could clearly sense the terrifying power of this strike, which had reached an unimaginable level!</p><p></p><p>As for Shenlo, the smile on his face had long since frozen...</p><p></p><p>"Clang!!"</p><p></p><p>At this moment, the terrifying sword qi ravaged the heavens and earth, visibly dispersing the war mist covering an area of millions, even tens of millions of miles.</p><p></p><p>The previous resounding sword cry seemed to be just a prelude, and this sword qi was the real killing move.</p><p></p><p>At this moment, every inch of the heavens and earth was permeated with the most chilling killing intent in the world.</p><p></p><p>The dense mass of tribal experts had already stopped moving, daring not to make a single move. Their faces were all deathly pale, their expressions filled with terror.</p><p></p><p>They dared not! They really dared not!</p><p></p><p>They could clearly sense the invisible sword qi fluctuating around them. It seemed that as long as the man in blue robes wished it, they would all be torn to shreds in an instant!</p><p></p><p>The strength of the human race's man in blue robes exceeded everyone's imagination!</p><p></p><p>This was not because he possessed the Liuli Heart and was fearless. </p><p></p><p>This was because his own strength was so powerful that he had no fear at all!</p><p></p><p>The tribal experts recalled the man in blue robes' earlier calm and indifferent demeanor, and finally understood.</p><p></p><p>No wonder he had acted that way - he had simply treated them as insignificant ants.</p><p></p><p>How could the human race have such a powerful expert? Why was he not on the rankings?</p><p></p><p>This level of strength was truly the number one individual combat power.</p><p></p><p>What was the Heavenly God Ruler in the face of this man in blue robes?</p><p></p><p>The human race... was it invincible on the God-Demon Battlefield?</p><p></p><p>"Please spare us, great lord! We dare not, we really dare not! Please be merciful and spare our lives. We will return to our tribes and present you with generous gifts to apologize to the human race!"</p><p></p><p>"Great lord, we don't want the Liuli Heart anymore! We really don't want it!"</p><p></p><p>"Please spare us, great lord!!"</p><p></p><p>The tribal experts were now like those with swords at their necks, their faces turning pale with fear, daring not to move a muscle as they begged for mercy.</p><p></p><p>Zixuan Yong, Xue Yue, and the others were also in utter anguish. They had originally planned to kill Jiang Wuxin and Man Tian, but now, who could understand this feeling?</p><p></p><p>"Hehe."</p><p></p><p>Lu Changsheng's mouth curled up in a slight cold smile.</p><p></p><p>Then, with a thought of his divine sense...</p><p></p><p>The sword qi lingering in the heavens and earth suddenly erupted, raging madly!</p><p></p><p>"Swoosh swoosh swoosh--!"</p><p></p><p>Instantly, the countless tribal experts on that side let out agonizing shrieks of terror.</p><p></p><p>"Ahhhhhhh!"</p><p></p><p>The human race spectators watched the scene in horror.</p><p></p><p>They could see the tribal experts...</p><p></p><p>Here is the full English translation of the Chinese excerpt:</p><p></p><p>In an instant, the person was torn apart, their entire body split into countless smooth fragments that fell from the sky!</p><p></p><p>A torrential blood rain poured down from the sky, and an endless number of body fragments fell like hail!</p><p></p><p>The expressions of Shenlo, Shenwei, Junbai, Qianbai, and the others behind them finally turned into complete terror!!</p><p></p><p>But for now, they were relieved that the terrifying sword qi had not targeted them......</p><p></p><p>In the heavens and earth, the agonizing screams never ceased, the blood rain never stopped!!</p><p></p><p>Jian Wuhui and the others had long since led the trembling cultivators of the Human Tribe to retreat to the back, fearing being caught in the sword qi!</p><p></p><p>Such a vast number of powerful experts from the myriad tribes, in just a moment, had turned the ground below into a river of blood!</p><p></p><p>The piles of corpse fragments were as high as mountains, and they continued to accumulate!!</p><p></p><p>An overwhelmingly pungent bloody stench filled everyone's nostrils, deeply stimulating their nerves!</p><p></p><p>Jian Wuhui and the others admitted that they had never witnessed such a terrifying scene.......</p><p></p><p>"Divine Son, the Human Tribe has the Eternal Lifeforms!!"</p><p></p><p>After Zixuan Yong shouted this in unwillingness, he too, along with Xueyu and the others, was torn apart by the sword qi, their body fragments falling into the pile of corpses below.</p><p></p><p>Shenlo and the others were shaken by this, incredulous!</p><p></p><p>Eternal Lifeforms.......</p><p></p><p>But now that it was said, was it still of any use?</p><p></p><p>On the Divine-Demonic Battlefield, who else could restrain the Human Tribe?</p><p></p><p>Time was slipping away, second by second.......</p><p></p><p>With each breath, countless powerful experts from the myriad tribes had their lives mercilessly taken.</p><p></p><p>Outside the Human Tribe's territory, it had become a complete slaughterhouse, a true hell on earth!</p><p></p><p>Until a certain moment, when all the powerful experts from the myriad tribes had been annihilated by the sword qi, except for the stunned and dazed Shenlo and the others.</p><p></p><p>Only then did Lu Changsheng casually wave his sleeve, and the rampaging sword qi in the heavens and earth finally began to dissipate......</p><p></p><p>Lu Changsheng's eyes looked down indifferently at the sea of blood and mountains of corpses below, a true hell on earth.</p><p></p><p>Today, he did not even know how many lives he had taken.</p><p></p><p>In his memory, this should be the most he had ever killed at one time.</p><p></p><p>Well, with so many people dying at once, the Spiritual Realm would certainly be lively, and the Soul Warden would have his hands full.</p><p></p><p>He had just now preserved a shred of humanity, giving all those powerful experts from the myriad tribes a chance to reincarnate.</p><p></p><p>......</p><p></p><p>At this moment, a deathly silence pervaded the heavens and earth, with only the gentle flow of the blood in the sea below.......</p><p></p><p>All eyes were trembling as they watched this dreamlike scene.</p><p></p><p>The myriad powerful experts who had just moments ago blotted out the sky, were now reduced to mere blood in the water.......</p><p></p><p>Many of the Human Tribe's cultivators, unable to withstand the extreme bloodiness of the scene, had even fainted in terror.</p><p></p><p>Even Moyang from the Crimson Sun Palace and Zhao Di, the third on the City Battle Ranking, were shivering in fear.</p><p></p><p>They hadn't forgotten that they had almost fought with this person before.......</p><p></p><p>As for Jian Wuhui and the others, they were as dumb as wooden chickens, and not just them, even Peng Fang and the others from the Carefree Sect had their souls shaken.</p><p></p><p>They shifted their gaze from the sea of blood and mountains of corpses to the calmly standing figure in blue.</p><p></p><p>Was this really the Sect Master they were familiar with?</p><p></p><p>Or had they never truly understood their Sect Master all along?</p><p></p><p>"M-Master."</p><p></p><p>Suddenly, Shenlo knelt down before Lu Changsheng, his face deathly pale and bloodless.</p><p></p><p>Upon closer inspection, even the corners of his mouth were trembling, devoid of the previous heroic and arrogant bearing.</p><p></p><p>Seeing this, the surviving top ten experts also hastily knelt down, their bodies trembling.</p><p></p><p>In the distance, Ao Xing and Bi Qiong exchanged a grim look, and led their tribes to kneel as well.</p><p></p><p>There was no help for it, this man in blue was too terrifying, truly a supreme killing deity.</p><p></p><p>Lu Changsheng moved slightly, appearing before Shenlo and the others.</p><p></p><p>Sensing this, Shenlo and the others could not suppress the trembling of their bodies!!</p><p></p><p>Lu Changsheng's expression was profound, like a deep abyss, as he looked down at Shenlo and said:</p><p></p><p>"Where is your heroic bearing?"</p><p></p><p>.........</p><p></p><p>PS: That's all for today's chapter, it's just what I managed to hastily write out.

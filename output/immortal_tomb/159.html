        <h1>Chapter 159</h1>
        <div class="content">
            <p>Here is the full English translation of the Chinese excerpt:</p><p></p><p>Seeing this, Zuo Choushan glared at Peng Fang with a fierce look, and at the same time, he felt a bit anxious. This was a great opportunity for him to build a good relationship with Lu Changsheng! Damn it!</p><p></p><p>He still wanted to fight for himself, so he quickly said, "Senior, let Zuo Choushan lead the way for you. If there are some ignorant flies, Zuo Choushan can also help you deal with them, so that you don't have to trouble yourself."</p><p></p><p>After all, although most people in Qingxuan Town knew about Changsheng Tavern, not many had actually seen Lu Changsheng in person.</p><p></p><p>The Xihun Liquor at Changsheng Tavern was limited in daily production, and the queues were difficult, plus the price of Xihun Liquor was expensive, so there were still quite a few people who had never come to drink it.</p><p></p><p>"No need, you just guard the courtyard gate," Lu Changsheng smiled and walked forward among the many gazes.</p><p></p><p>Peng Fang chuckled, glanced at Zuo Choushan, and quickly followed Lu Changsheng.</p><p></p><p>Zuo Choushan was suddenly shaken by Peng Fang's gaze, his eyes flickering, wondering if this fat man didn't know that he was the lord of the Tianshefeng. Ruining his good deed, it was simply courting death.</p><p></p><p>If Lu Changsheng wasn't here, and if this place was more suitable, he would have killed this fat man without hesitation.</p><p></p><p>Since he is guiding that senior today, fine... But in the future, if there is a chance, he must let this hateful fat man know why the flowers are so red!</p><p></p><p>The waiting cultivators outside the courtyard saw that Zuo Choushan's expression was not very good, and they all became more obedient, fearing that they might have offended him and brought about a disaster.</p><p></p><p>This gatekeeper is not the same as the ordinary one... This is the lord of the Tianshefeng.</p><p></p><p>In Qingxuan Town, perhaps only the shopkeeper could control him.</p><p></p><p>...</p><p></p><p>Dry Seclusion City in the Black Calamity Domain was relatively closer to Qingxuan Town among the large cities.</p><p></p><p>In the Black Calamity Domain, there were only twenty large cities, and the magnificence and prosperity of these cities could be imagined.</p><p></p><p>The four major forces similar to the Tianshefeng, Juxue Gang, Yingyou Tower, and Kongguai Dao in Qingxuan Town, if they came to this Dry Seclusion City, they would probably appear rather ordinary.</p><p></p><p>At the same time, in the Heavenly Pavilion.</p><p></p><p>In the magnificent palace, several figures were sitting opposite each other.</p><p></p><p>"Elder Jiang, the person in the painting, our lord has never seen him before. The Black Calamity Domain, although it is a small domain, is still quite large... And our lord is usually busy with affairs, so it's hard for him to have an impression of others."</p><p></p><p>Kunlun Ju looked at the painting on the table and smiled bitterly.</p><p></p><p>The deputy lord sitting beside him was sitting upright, with a slightly solemn expression.</p><p></p><p>After all, the two elders in front of them were from the Imperial Clan, the Jiang Clan!</p><p></p><p>Although their Heavenly Pavilion was not weak in strength, they were far inferior to the Imperial Clan in terms of overall strength and foundation!</p><p></p><p>Jiang Chu and Jiang Chong exchanged a glance, and then Jiang Chu said, "To find this person, we have almost traversed the entire Black Calamity Domain. If we fail to complete the task, we will have a hard time explaining it to the clan leader."</p><p></p><p>"Lord Kun, we have no foundation in this Black Calamity Domain, so it's very difficult for us to search. This kind of thing is better done by the local people here."</p><p></p><p>"Don't worry, now there are only two large cities and four small towns in the Black Calamity Domain that we haven't searched yet. This range shouldn't be too large for you, right?"</p><p></p><p>Kunlun Ju and the deputy lord beside him suddenly exchanged a startled glance.</p><p></p><p>They didn't know what the relationship between the middle-aged man in the painting and the Jiang Imperial Clan was, and the Jiang Imperial Clan actually searched almost the entire Black Calamity Domain to find this person...</p><p></p><p>Kunlun Ju was silent for a moment, looking at Jiang Chu and asking, "Elder Jiang, which two large cities and four small towns?"</p><p></p><p>Jiang Chu's eyes narrowed slightly and he said indifferently, "Cangxuan City, Xingue City, Kumu Town, Baigutong Town, Yuanshan Town, and there's one more, I think it's called Qingxuan Town."</p><p></p><p>Hearing this, Kunlun Ju secretly let out a sigh of relief. These two large cities and five small towns were not particularly far from their Dry Seclusion City, relatively closer than other cities and towns.</p><p></p><p>It seems that the two elders of the Jiang Imperial Clan in front of them really searched meticulously...</p><p></p><p>It's hard to imagine how much time they spent on this.</p><p></p><p>As for the deputy lord beside him, when he heard Qingxuan Town, his throat rolled slightly imperceptibly.</p><p></p><p>"Elder Jiang, there are a few forces in Cangxuan City and Xingue City that I know, but this kind of small matter... I'm afraid they won't be interested in helping. If they..."</p><p></p><p>Here is the full English translation of the Chinese excerpt:</p><p></p><p>"Without help, relying solely on our Celestial Sect, it's too difficult," he said.</p><p></p><p>The new 69 book bar â†’ 69shu.com</p><p></p><p>"And if the person in the portrait has the intention to hide, change their name and appearance, alter their aura and even their physique and gender, trying to find them... would be like searching for a needle in the ocean."</p><p></p><p>Kunlun Ju shook his head and smiled helplessly, saying that it was not just like searching for a needle in the ocean, but a complete fantasy.</p><p></p><p>Jiang Chu suddenly smiled, flipping his palm to take out a bronze mirror. In the puzzled gaze of the other two, he said in a solemn voice, "The difficulty is there, but not as exaggerated as you say. The person in the portrait has a woman who carries the bloodline of my Jiang Clan's immortal race. If they reach a certain distance, the bronze mirror will react."</p><p></p><p>The bloodline of the Jiang Clan's immortal race?! So they were searching for a relative! Then who was the man in the portrait?</p><p></p><p>Kunlun Ju and the Vice Palace Master were startled, and then became somewhat puzzled. They wanted to ask, if you have the means to find them, why bother coming to their Celestial Sect, isn't that redundant...</p><p></p><p>But Jiang Chu frowned and said solemnly, "Palace Master Kun, for certain reasons, we have not sought help from any forces in the Black Sha Domain on our journey. Now, we have run out of patience, so we've come to your Celestial Palace. Before that, I have a word of warning for you."</p><p></p><p>Immediately, Kunlun Ju and the Vice Palace Master's pupils shrank.</p><p></p><p>"What I want to say is, regarding the news of my imperial clan's daughter being lost outside, you'd better keep it to yourselves..." Jiang Chu said calmly, his gaze fixed directly on Kunlun Ju. This was the reason they had not sought help from any forces along the way.</p><p></p><p>If they were not truly out of patience, they would not have wanted to reveal this matter. Now they were only vaguely telling Kunlun Ju, but if Kunlun Ju were to later pursue the clues of this matter, he might discover the unsightly affairs of the Jiang Clan's imperial family.</p><p></p><p>In that case... they would have to kill Kunlun Ju and destroy the Celestial Palace.</p><p></p><p>Otherwise, the clan leader might blame Jiang Chu and Jiang Chong, and the punishment would certainly not be light.</p><p></p><p>Sensing the murderous intent, Kunlun Ju and the Vice Palace Master's expressions changed.</p><p></p><p>"Master Jiang, rest assured, the affairs of the imperial clan, our palace would not dare to pay too much attention to," Kunlun Ju said quickly with a smile, his eyes flashing.</p><p></p><p>"That's good then." Jiang Chu's heart relaxed a bit, and the bronze mirror in his hand suddenly split into ten.</p><p></p><p>He handed nine of the bronze mirrors to Kunlun Ju, saying, "These nine mirrors are the limit of that bronze mirror. Rest assured, each one will react to the bloodline of my imperial clan. You can use these nine mirrors yourself."</p><p></p><p>As for why the mirror did not react to Jiang Chu and Jiang Chong at the moment, it was because they had already been identified by the mirror.</p><p></p><p>Kunlun Ju looked at the nine bronze mirrors in his hand, pondering silently on how to distribute them and where to start.</p><p></p><p>Jiang Chu and Jiang Chong did not disturb him.</p><p></p><p>At this time, the silent Vice Palace Master next to them suddenly spoke, "Masters Jiang, Palace Master, what if we start from Qingxuan Town?"</p><p></p><p>Oh?</p><p></p><p>The three of them looked at him.</p><p></p><p>The Vice Palace Master licked his lips and explained, "Qingxuan Town is the closest to our Ganyu City, and recently Qingxuan Town has been quite lively in the surrounding towns. I've heard that there's a tavern called Longevity there, and its Washsoul Brew is an unparalleled fine wine. I've heard that just drinking one cup can surpass all in the world."</p><p></p><p>"Masters Jiang, you two have been traveling hard, why not take the opportunity to visit Qingxuan Town and enjoy a cup, since it's on the way anyway."</p><p></p><p>Such a miraculous wine? Washsoul Brew? The name is quite special.</p><p></p><p>Jiang Chu and Jiang Chong exchanged a glance, then both nodded in agreement. This arrangement... was not bad.</p><p></p><p>"Haha, good, then it's settled." Kunlun Ju stood up and handed the nine bronze mirrors to the Vice Palace Master, saying, "Vice Palace Master, go distribute these bronze mirrors to the elders in the palace, let them immediately go to the other towns besides Qingxuan Town that Master Jiang mentioned to search. If they find the person, have them report it immediately. As for the rest, tell them not to ask!"</p><p></p><p>"Mm." The Vice Palace Master took the nine bronze mirrors and disappeared in a flash.</p><p></p><p>"Haha, Masters Jiang, please rest for now. When the Vice Palace Master returns, we'll set out for Qingxuan Town," Kunlun Ju said with a smile.</p><p></p><p>Jiang Chu and Jiang Chong nodded slightly.</p><p></p><p>At the same time, on the streets of the distant Qingxuan Town,</p><p></p><p>Lu Changsheng's footsteps suddenly paused...</p><p></p><p>Paying close attention to Lu Changsheng, Peng Fang was startled and quickly asked, "Proprietor, what's wrong?"</p><p></p><p>This was the proprietor of the Longevity Tavern, after all. If the relationship was good, the Washsoul Brew wouldn't be casually drunk, hehe...</p><p></p><p>This was Peng Fang's true inner thoughts.</p><p></p><p>Lu Changsheng looked up at the scorching sun and the black cracks in the sky, and smiled, "The weather today is truly nice, I just wonder how the next few days will be."</p>

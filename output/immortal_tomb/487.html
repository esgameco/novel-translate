        <h1>Chapter 487</h1>
        <div class="content">
            <p>Here is the full English translation of the Chinese excerpt:</p><p></p><p>In the eternal night city, the fluctuations of the laws were becoming increasingly intense.</p><p></p><p>The cultivators hurriedly retreated, leaving the field to the three major factions.</p><p></p><p>Even many cultivators fled outside the eternal night city, and after deploying various defensive measures, they looked back at that place in shock.</p><p></p><p>No one had expected that the Three Tigers Gang would actually say they were going to attack.</p><p></p><p>"Three Tigers Gang, have you gone mad? You actually want to go to war with us over a hall master? Do you know the consequences of going to war?"</p><p></p><p>The Fierce Lion Faction leader's eyes were gloomy as he shouted, "Moreover, the death of your hall master has nothing to do with us...!"</p><p></p><p>Saying this, the Fierce Lion Faction leader's eyes suddenly changed, and he coldly laughed, "Hehe, the lord knows, the so-called death of the hall master is just a pretext. You Three Tigers Gang have been waiting for this day for a long time..."</p><p></p><p>The three gang leaders of the Three Tigers Gang had to admit that the Fierce Lion Faction leader was very sharp.</p><p></p><p>"Fierce Lion, what do you mean?" the Violent Elephant Sect Master frowned and asked.</p><p></p><p>At the same time, many puzzled gazes also turned to him.</p><p></p><p>The Fierce Lion Faction leader laughed loudly, "The so-called seeking justice for the hall master is just an excuse, a pretext. The Three Tigers Gang has long wanted to start a war. Their ambition is not limited to this; they want to dominate the Eternal Night Island!"</p><p></p><p>What?!</p><p></p><p>The crowd was shocked!</p><p></p><p>Many cultivators who had been living on the Eternal Night Island immediately looked at the Three Tigers Gang with some hostility!</p><p></p><p>If this were the case, they would definitely stand on the side of the Fierce Lion Faction and the Violent Elephant Sect to resist the Three Tigers Gang!</p><p></p><p>Seeing this, the three gang leaders of the Three Tigers Gang had a gloomy look in their eyes. If these many local cultivators stood on the Fierce Lion's side, it would be extremely unfavorable for their Three Tigers Gang.</p><p></p><p>"Big Brother, we can't delay any longer. Delaying further won't do us any good!"</p><p></p><p>"Yes, Big Brother, while the situation is still unclear, we should directly subdue the two factions. As long as we subdue them, everything will be under the control of our Three Tigers Gang."</p><p></p><p>Hearing this, the big gang leader couldn't help but glance at the members of the gang. Sure enough, he also saw that the expressions of the members had changed somewhat.</p><p></p><p>He then suddenly raised his hand and shouted loudly:</p><p></p><p>"My Three Tigers Gang is upright and righteous. How could we have such ambitions? Fierce Lion! Stop deceiving the masses! Today, our gang leader will help Big Bear and hundreds of brothers take revenge! Come at us with your lives!"</p><p></p><p>As soon as he finished speaking, the big gang leader rushed towards the slightly changed Fierce Lion.</p><p></p><p>The second and third gang leaders then attacked the Violent Elephant Sect Master.</p><p></p><p>The members of the Three Tigers Gang also shot out like arrows released from a bow!</p><p></p><p>At this moment, the battle was instantly ignited, and there was no room for the crowd to continue guessing blindly!</p><p></p><p>"Haha! Good!" The Fierce Lion Faction leader threw his head back and laughed loudly, then his gaze became fierce:</p><p></p><p>"Since it's like this, then from now on, only one side can exist on the Eternal Night Island - us, the Fierce Lion Faction and the Violent Elephant Sect! Fierce Lion Faction, kill!"</p><p></p><p>"Violent Elephant Sect, kill!" The Violent Elephant Sect Master clenched his fists tightly, and his clothes were instantly torn apart by his bursting muscles.</p><p></p><p>Soon, the Eternal Night City erupted in light, with various laws emerging one after another, as there were no shortage of cultivators who had mastered the laws, the only difference being their level of proficiency and mastery.</p><p></p><p>The ordinary disciples of the factions had relatively weak law comprehension, and their law attributes were generally not strong either.</p><p></p><p>But once they reached the level of hall masters, they would have considerable combat power, with their laws either filled with offensive power or highly functional!</p><p></p><p>The next moment, one of the hall masters of the Fierce Lion Faction made a hand seal, connecting his consciousness to heaven and earth, and shouted, "Law of Mist, cover me!"</p><p></p><p>Centered on him, a mighty mist suddenly spread out in the Eternal Night City, quickly enveloping the entire city.</p><p></p><p>"Huh?! This, this is the Law of Mist, the law power of the Third Hall Master of the Fierce Lion Faction!"</p><p></p><p>"Sss, you can't see anything... But what's the use of that? If both sides can't see each other, won't they just be blindly striking around?"</p><p></p><p>"Hehe, you're wrong. Do you really think the Law of Mist is that simple? As the one who released this law, the Third Hall Master of the Fierce Lion Faction has achieved a certain level of mastery in the Law of Mist. He can freely control the density of the mist, and this mist also contains a deadly poison."</p><p></p><p>"If that's the case, in the mist, the Three Tigers Gang's vision is obstructed, but the Fierce Lion Faction and the Violent Elephant Sect are not affected?"</p><p></p><p>"Exactly!"</p><p></p><p>"How do you know so much about the Law of Mist?"</p><p></p><p>"Hehe, I'm not that capable. I've also comprehended the Law of Mist, but my cultivation is far behind the Third Hall Master of the Fierce Lion Faction."</p><p></p><p>"......"</p><p></p><p>At this moment, the entire Eternal Night City was shrouded in the drifting mist.</p><p></p><p>Except for the members of the three major factions, all other cultivators had already fled the Eternal Night City and were watching from afar, their hearts filled with terror.</p><p></p><p>"Big Brother, this mist seems to contain a deadly poison. Look at those flowers, grasses, and trees..."</p><p></p><p>Chen Pang pointed at a spot in horror. Xiao Chai looked over, and sure enough, he saw that the plants withered the moment they came into contact with the mist.</p><p></p><p>At the same time, the members of the Three Tigers Gang inside the city were somewhat panicked. They immediately activated their life-saving methods to isolate themselves from the mist, but unfortunately, apart from the hall master-level figures, they couldn't withstand it at all, and many of them immediately had their legs turn weak.</p><p></p><p>"Gui Lang, what are you waiting for? Quickly disperse the poisonous mist!"</p><p></p><p>The big gang leader shouted during his battle with the Fierce Lion Faction leader.</p><p></p><p>Gui Lang was the second hall master of the Three Tigers Gang. He was stunned for a moment.</p><p></p><p>Here is the full English translation of the Chinese excerpt:</p><p></p><p>Quickly communicating the will of heaven and earth, he shouted, "The law of the wind, disperse!"</p><p></p><p>Whoosh whoosh whoosh whoosh—</p><p></p><p>In the space between heaven and earth, a fierce wind suddenly arose, sweeping across Eternal Night City!</p><p></p><p>In an instant, the poisonous mist in the entire city surged like ocean waves, and was then driven out of the city!</p><p></p><p>Rumble!</p><p></p><p>Due to the overwhelming strength of the wind, countless buildings in Eternal Night City collapsed, and many were even swept up into the sky by the gale.</p><p></p><p>After the fierce wind passed, Eternal Night City was left in ruins.</p><p></p><p>The members of the Three Tigers Gang also quickly recovered and continued to engage in the battle.</p><p></p><p>Seeing this, the Third Hall Master of the Fierce Lion Sect's face darkened, and he glared hatefully at the Second Hall Master of the Three Tigers Gang. The latter's wind law was also a powerful law, and it was very effective in countering his own law.</p><p></p><p>He had already anticipated that the other side would take action.</p><p></p><p>The Third Hall Master of the Fierce Lion Sect sighed lightly, and his hand emanated a poisonous mist as he attacked the other Hall Master.</p><p></p><p>Large-scale laws could not be used casually, as that would consume too much of the law power within his body.</p><p></p><p>However, the Second Hall Master of the Three Tigers Gang was relentless. His eyes sharpened, and he surged his inner law power, roaring fiercely, "Annihilating Sky Wind Blades!"</p><p></p><p>High in the sky, invisible wind blades coalesced, blotting out the sun!</p><p></p><p>With a fierce swing of the Second Hall Master's hand, the endless wind blades ruthlessly descended upon Eternal Night City like a torrential downpour!</p><p></p><p>Swoosh swoosh swoosh swoosh swoosh—!</p><p></p><p>The Second Hall Master rapidly formed hand seals, his face turning deathly pale and unsteady.</p><p></p><p>The reason was that he had to exert tremendous mental focus to control the wind blades and lock onto the targets.</p><p></p><p>If he had attacked indiscriminately, it would have been much easier for him!</p><p></p><p>Soon, agonized screams echoed throughout Eternal Night City. Countless members of the Fierce Lion Sect and the Savage Elephant Sect were instantly slain!</p><p></p><p>The invisible wind blades made it extremely difficult for people to dodge based on their senses alone.</p><p></p><p>Seeing this, the morale of the Three Tigers Gang soared!</p><p></p><p>"The Second Hall Master is mighty!!"</p><p></p><p>"Damn it!!" The upper echelons of the Fierce Lion Sect and the Savage Elephant Sect were furious.</p><p></p><p>So this is how they wanted to play it, huh?</p><p></p><p>Among them, a Hall Master of the Savage Elephant Sect quickly broke free from a high-level member of the Three Tigers Gang, then raised his hand, declaring, "Earth Law, Protective Shield!"</p><p></p><p>Boom!</p><p></p><p>As soon as he spoke, the entire Eternal Night City began to tremble, and the ground instantly cracked and split apart!</p><p></p><p>Countless clumps of earth flew into the sky, forming massive and dense defensive barriers that blocked the endless wind blades!</p><p></p><p>But the thick earthen walls soon began to develop cracks, unable to withstand the onslaught.</p><p></p><p>The Savage Elephant Sect Hall Master's eyes hardened, and he waved his hand again, causing even more earth to surge upward, frantically reinforcing the walls.</p><p></p><p>"Puppet Wolf! I don't believe you can hold out! You've already expended a wave of power, and now this massive consumption, your inner law power must be nearly exhausted, yet you still insist on showing off?"</p><p></p><p>The Second Hall Master of the Three Tigers Gang, Puppet Wolf, heard this and his eyes burned with unwillingness. He abruptly withdrew his hand, his figure staggering as the tremendous drain on his spiritual power and law power had left him nearly depleted.</p><p></p><p>The endless wind blades instantly dissipated into nothingness!</p><p></p><p>The members of the Fierce Lion Sect and the Savage Elephant Sect finally let out a sigh of relief, but the first wave had still claimed the lives of many of their own.</p><p></p><p>The Second Hall Master of the Three Tigers Gang was truly formidable!</p><p></p><p>At this moment, the three Sect Leaders of the Three Tigers Gang had already engaged in battle with the Fierce Lion Sect Leader and the Savage Elephant Sect Master high in the sky above!</p><p></p><p>One could see that the heavens were turbulent, with occasional thunderous explosions and flashes of light illuminating the entire Eternal Night Island!</p><p></p><p>The battle between the three major powers was truly terrifying!</p><p></p><p>The watching cultivators were filled with a chill in their hearts, their minds shaken by the tremendous disturbances...</p><p></p><p>The ship captain and the others had gathered together at some point.</p><p></p><p>"Huh, where's the elder?" The ship captain swept his gaze over the cultivators - Chen Fat, Little Chai, the two elves, and the other cultivators were all present.</p><p></p><p>But the elder in the blue robe was nowhere to be seen. Could he still be in the city?</p><p></p><p>But the entire Eternal Night City had already fallen into ruin...</p><p></p><p>The group shuddered, their thoughts turning to the worst.</p><p></p><p>Meanwhile, in the restaurant,</p><p></p><p>the ground was cracked and split, and the roof of the restaurant had long been blasted through by the wind blades.</p><p></p><p>Lu Changsheng and Old Turtle were still sitting at their table, but neither of them spoke.</p><p></p><p>Old Turtle carefully looked at the fallen wood chips and dirt on the table, which had dirtied all the dishes. And due to the collapse of the ground, the entire table was tilted.</p><p></p><p>Old Turtle inwardly sighed, realizing that just as he had expected, they had been caught in the collateral damage.</p><p></p><p>If one were to ask why he didn't just casually block those wood chips and dirt, the answer was simple - it was someone else's mistake, and he absolutely refused to foot the bill.</p><p></p><p>"Cough cough, Master, what do we do?" Old Turtle asked with a forced smile.</p><p></p><p>Lu Changsheng couldn't be bothered to pay attention to Old Turtle, and simply stood up, walking out with his hands behind his back.</p><p></p><p>Old Turtle immediately grinned and hurriedly followed like a loyal dog.</p><p></p><p>Inwardly, Old Turtle's desire to grow stronger had also intensified.</p><p></p><p>Because... with power, one could truly do as they pleased! If I'm not satisfied with my meals, I can just take care of you!</p><p></p><p>Yes, following the example of his master.</p>

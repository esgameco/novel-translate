        <h1>Chapter 76</h1>
        <div class="content">
            <p>Here is my translation of the Chinese excerpt:</p><p></p><p>Seeing that Gu Helin was standing there dumbfounded, the old turtle-faced man broke into a lecherous smile and said, "Alright, you don't need to worry so much. As long as you keep this old turtle happy for the time being, I can certainly help you out later on."</p><p></p><p>Gu Helin was delighted and said expectantly, "Yes, senior turtle, how would you like me to keep you company? Helin will do his best to satisfy you!"</p><p></p><p>The old turtle chuckled and rubbed his hands together, saying, "Naturally it's that, what else did you think I meant?"</p><p></p><p>Gu Helin's body suddenly shuddered as he understood the old turtle's suggestive meaning. He turned around, braced himself against the wall, closed his eyes, and said with determination, "Senior turtle, Helin is no longer young, so please go easy on me."</p><p></p><p>The old turtle: "?"</p><p></p><p>Slap!</p><p></p><p>The old turtle's face turned black with anger as he angrily slapped Gu Helin to the ground and sternly demanded, "What the hell are you trying to pull?"</p><p></p><p>Gu Helin rubbed his head and stood up, extremely embarrassed, "Ah, senior turtle, as an 'upright' person like you, Helin must have misunderstood. So what did you mean by 'keeping you company'?"</p><p></p><p>The old turtle snorted and turned to leave, saying, "Consider yourself lucky you caught on quickly. This old turtle is an 'upright' person, let's go."</p><p></p><p>Gu Helin hurriedly followed, carefully asking, "Senior turtle, where are we going? The master is still in the restaurant."</p><p></p><p>"The master said to rest for two days, so you'll just keep me company going out to play."</p><p></p><p>"Uh, play what?"</p><p></p><p>"Chasing flowers and willows, of course."</p><p></p><p>"Ah, senior turtle, Helin is not skilled in that area, I'll just watch you play."</p><p></p><p>"What? I won't force you if you don't want to, but just standing there watching me is a bit too much, Helin!"</p><p></p><p>"......"</p><p></p><p>Here is the full English translation of the Chinese excerpt:</p><p></p><p>The many cultivators also realized it, looking at the old turtle, he looked more and more like that Transcendent Cultivator from the other day!</p><p></p><p>Combining with the previous cultivator who said the three were all at the Transcendent Realm, this hunchbacked old man's physique and cultivation were completely identical to the Transcendent Cultivator from the past two days.</p><p></p><p>At some point, the originally quiet street had become even more deathly silent.</p><p></p><p>The cultivators were all looking at Luchang Sheng and the others in an extremely subtle way.</p><p></p><p>Recalling the situation that day, and then thinking of the hunchbacked old man's words about his master, they unanimously looked towards the leading blue-robed man!</p><p></p><p>Their pupils shrank infinitely!</p><p></p><p>The old turtle always felt like the four of them were being treated like monkeys, so he paused in his steps, surveyed the surrounding cultivators, and let out a cold smile, saying:</p><p></p><p>"You little cultivators really aren't afraid of death, are you? Be careful, Grandpa Turtle will gouge out your eyes!"</p><p></p><p>Instantly, the cultivators were frightened and hurriedly dispersed!</p><p></p><p>They were extremely shaken in their hearts, it was truly the same person!</p><p></p><p>Whether it was the tone of voice or the "Grandpa Turtle", it all represented the same person!</p><p></p><p>Then what about the blue-robed man as his master, a Tribulation Transcendent Cultivator?</p><p></p><p>In just a moment, the ten-mile-long alley was empty.</p><p></p><p>"Tch, a bunch of little bunnies."</p><p></p><p>The old turtle sneered disdainfully and swayed his waist, flashing to catch up with Luchang Sheng and the others.</p><p></p><p>At the doors of the Tianrun Trading Company,</p><p></p><p>"Fellow Daoist Luchang, please!"</p><p></p><p>Chu Xiran made a gesture of invitation.</p><p></p><p>In Chu Xiran's eyes, the master-servant pair in front of her were stronger than her, so just in case, she should maintain a proper attitude.</p><p></p><p>Otherwise, if she accidentally offended this pair, she might not be able to return to the Immortal Realm, and could even be killed by their joint efforts... Then she would have to cry.</p><p></p><p>As for Chu Xiran's psychological thoughts, Luchang Sheng understood them thoroughly, and looked at her amusedly before stepping in.</p><p></p><p>Inside the Tianrun Trading Company.</p><p></p><p>Divided into one to five floors, each floor was very spacious, filled with dazzling treasures, various lights intersecting, blinding the eyes.</p><p></p><p>At this moment, there were many cultivators wandering around, sometimes walking, sometimes pausing.</p><p></p><p>Truly the number one trading company in the Eastern Domain of the Immortal Cultivation World, it was truly extravagant, every time they came, they would be shocked.</p><p></p><p>Gu Helin sighed inwardly like this.</p><p></p><p>"You four, are you here to trade or...?"</p><p></p><p>Very quickly, a uniformed receptionist came in front of Luchang Sheng and the others, bowing and asking.</p><p></p><p>Before Gu Helin could speak, Chu Xiran said indifferently, "We need to use the teleportation formation to the Western Domain."</p><p></p><p>The receptionist's expression changed slightly, then smiled and said, "Please wait a moment, I will go report to the butler, this is not within my authority."</p><p></p><p>After saying that, he bowed and left.</p><p></p><p>"Hehe, you four, are you going to the Western Domain to witness the Ascension Tribulation?"</p><p></p><p>In no time, a well-dressed old man came over, his face full of smiles and very amiable.</p><p></p><p>Judging from his appearance, he was one of the two old men who had brought people to the Tribulation site a few days ago!</p><p></p><p>The Sixth Elder, the Sixth Butler!</p><p></p><p>Chu Xiran was about to speak, but the old turtle became a little impatient and said, "That's right, hurry up and take us there, don't let my master wait and get annoyed!"</p><p></p><p>As soon as he spoke, the Sixth Butler's pupils shrank, and his fist in his sleeve slowly clenched.</p><p></p><p>This voice... Wasn't it the voice of the Transcendent Cultivator in the sky above the Nameless Inn the other day...</p><p></p><p>Luchang Sheng's keen senses detected the Sixth Butler's emotions and thoughts, and his originally calm eyes became a little playful.</p><p></p><p>"You four, I'm sorry, actually what I wanted to say just now was that our company's teleportation formation to the Western Domain is having some problems today and can't be used for the time being."</p><p></p><p>The Sixth Butler shook his head regretfully.</p>

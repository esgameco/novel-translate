        <div class="content">
            <p>Here is the full English translation of the Chinese excerpt:</p><p></p><p>In a restaurant, Lu Changsheng casually found a seat by the window, then ordered two pots of wine and a few dishes of spiritual energy.</p><p></p><p>Lu Changsheng thought for a moment, his mind entering the Great Dao Demon Subduing Tower, arriving at a corner where a turtle shell was lying quietly.</p><p></p><p>Lu Changsheng kicked it with his foot, infusing it with some qi while chuckling, "Old Turtle, wake up and have a drink with me?"</p><p></p><p>Hm?</p><p></p><p>A turtle head poked out of the shell, seeming a bit disoriented. But after seeing Lu Changsheng, it got startled and suddenly transformed into a human form, trembling as it said:</p><p></p><p>"M-Master!"</p><p></p><p>Lu Changsheng waved his hand, then brought the Old Turtle out of the Great Dao Demon Subduing Tower, appearing in the restaurant.</p><p></p><p>"Sit, have a drink with me," Lu Changsheng said with a smile.</p><p></p><p>The Old Turtle regained its senses, looking around the place with a wary gaze, not knowing where it was. It then eyed Lu Changsheng suspiciously before carefully sitting down.</p><p></p><p>The Old Turtle poured wine for Lu Changsheng, then poured a cup for itself. After Lu Changsheng took a sip, the Old Turtle picked up the cup and took a careful sip as well: "Master, how long was I unconscious... and where is this place?"</p><p></p><p>The Old Turtle could feel that this was no longer the Qiankun Heavens, damn it, it hadn't even entered the Void Ancient Realm yet and had already passed out.</p><p></p><p>Lu Changsheng picked up his chopsticks, taking a bite of the dish and chewing it slowly before swallowing and saying with a smile, "You weren't out for long. This is no longer the Qiankun Heavens, but the Three Thousand Realms, and we are currently in the Sea of Principles."</p><p></p><p>The Old Turtle nodded slightly, then carefully looked at Lu Changsheng and mustered up the courage to say:</p><p></p><p>"Master, please be honest with Old Turtle - was it because I smuggled some personal... items last time that led to such a harsh punishment?"</p><p></p><p>Otherwise, it wouldn't have been so disastrous.</p><p></p><p>Lu Changsheng raised his gaze to look at the Old Turtle, saying in a deep tone, "You think I brought in personal grievances?"</p><p></p><p>The Old Turtle gave an embarrassed smile. "Just joking."</p><p></p><p>But Lu Changsheng said, "That's right, I did bring in personal grievances. Is that not allowed?"</p><p></p><p>The Old Turtle's expression changed slightly, his body starting to tremble. "Of course it's allowed!"</p><p></p><p>Seeing the frightened Old Turtle, Lu Changsheng suddenly spoke earnestly:</p><p></p><p>"Old Turtle, do you not know your own worth? In the Qiankun Heavens' Heavenly Abyss, you couldn't even handle a small demonic creature - this truly disappoints me."</p><p></p><p>"I've forgotten how long you've been following me, but it must have been a long time. As my mount, if you don't cultivate diligently and instead indulge in women all day, how can you expect me, your master, to take care of everything for you?"</p><p></p><p>"If you continue to decline, even Tongxin and Lindong will surpass you."</p><p></p><p>Hearing this, the Old Turtle was filled with shame, wanting to find a crack in the ground to hide in.</p><p></p><p>It seems he had misjudged his master. Of course a supreme cultivator like his master wouldn't be petty.</p><p></p><p>"Master, rest assured. From today on, Old Turtle will stay away from beauties and focus on cultivation, not letting down your teachings."</p><p></p><p>The Old Turtle bowed his head.</p><p></p><p>Lu Changsheng glanced at the Old Turtle. "If I remember correctly, you've said this many times before."</p><p></p><p>The Old Turtle was immediately embarrassed.</p><p></p><p>Lu Changsheng gave a faint smile. "Your lifespan is also very long, you should have gained some insights."</p><p></p><p>The Old Turtle hurriedly said, "Yes, yes, yes. Beautiful women are like fleeting clouds and red flowers that wither - no matter how beautiful the appearance, it is just an ugly skeleton supporting it in the end... Eventually, the red flowers will fade and the dry bones be lost."</p><p></p><p>The Old Turtle actually understood the principles, after all, it had lived for so long. But but...</p><p></p><p>Lu Changsheng put down his chopsticks and said softly, "This is the Sea of Principles. As long as you cultivate diligently, with your speed, it should be quite simple."</p><p></p><p>The Old Turtle was delighted, quickly thumping his chest in guarantee. "Master, rest assured!"</p><p></p><p>"Don't be so quick to be happy. I'll tell you, if I find you slacking off again..."</p><p></p><p>Here is the full English translation of the Chinese excerpt:</p><p></p><p>"Lazy, go back where you came from. I don't need a useless waste like you following me around."</p><p></p><p>Lu Changsheng looked at the old turtle indifferently, his tone calm.</p><p></p><p>Originally, Lu Changsheng had planned to let the old turtle remain unconscious for a few more days, but the actions of those two elves just now had made him change his attitude.</p><p></p><p>Sometimes, it's better to have a capable lackey around to take care of some odd jobs.</p><p></p><p>Now that there's no one else around, the old turtle will have to do.</p><p></p><p>The old turtle was flustered, and immediately stood up, swearing on his own initiative:</p><p></p><p>"Master, rest assured. The old turtle swears that from now on, he will focus on cultivation, work hard to improve himself, and help the master shoulder the burden. If I break this oath... may my little turtle shrink five inches!"</p><p></p><p>This oath was quite vicious.</p><p></p><p>Hearing this, Lu Changsheng was initially a bit puzzled, but after reacting, his face darkened slightly, and he waved his hand to let the old turtle sit down.</p><p></p><p>The old turtle scratched his head, sat down awkwardly, and asked puzzledly, "Master, what about Tongxin, Linzong, and the others?"</p><p></p><p>"I have temporarily dispersed them in the Qiankun Heaven." Lu Changsheng rubbed his temples.</p><p></p><p>The old turtle nodded and quietly drank his wine, no longer speaking.</p><p></p><p>"Old turtle." Lu Changsheng said indifferently, "The final destination of this voyage will be the place of law comprehension, which will be a good opportunity for you to grow stronger."</p><p></p><p>Profound techniques are powerful, but a small number of powerful laws are not necessarily weaker than profound techniques, and may even surpass them.</p><p></p><p>For example, the Light Profound Technique and the Space Law, although one is a profound technique and the other is a law, the Light Profound Technique may not necessarily be able to defeat the Space Law.</p><p></p><p>After all, profound techniques and laws are both at the Void Realm, and profound techniques are only slightly more advanced than laws.</p><p></p><p>Since profound techniques have not surpassed the Void Realm, they have not surpassed laws by much, and some top-tier laws can surpass profound techniques with their powerful abilities and characteristics.</p><p></p><p>Such as the Time System, Space System, Power System, Destruction System, Fate System, and so on...</p><p></p><p>The old turtle paused, quickly saying, "Master, rest assured!"</p><p></p><p>Although he said this, the old turtle was inwardly anxious. Comprehending the law is simple, but what if the law he comprehends is trash? The old turtle suddenly felt a little lacking in self-confidence.</p><p></p><p>Lu Changsheng nodded and said no more.</p><p></p><p>...</p><p></p><p>In the Three Tigers Gang, the atmosphere was particularly solemn!</p><p></p><p>Slap!</p><p></p><p>The Third Gang Leader coldly threw a teacup hard at a subordinate's head, shattering it instantly!</p><p></p><p>The subordinate did not dare to block it, and was immediately hit, his head bleeding profusely. He trembled and said,</p><p></p><p>"Third Gang Leader, the brothers have tried their best, but there really is not a single clue. The remains of Elder Brother Bear and the brothers cannot be found at all, they must have been completely destroyed..."</p><p></p><p>"So you're saying that Elder Brother Bear and the others died in vain? Useless, all of you are useless! What am I keeping you around for?!"</p><p></p><p>The Third Gang Leader roared.</p><p></p><p>The subordinate was terrified, afraid that he might lose his life at any moment.</p><p></p><p>After venting his anger, the Third Gang Leader calmed down and said coldly, "Elder Brother Bear's death is definitely related to the other two forces! They can't get away with this!"</p><p></p><p>As he spoke, the Third Gang Leader walked out of the room, his words full of murderous intent continuing to be heard,</p><p></p><p>"This time, a Hall Master has died, and I, the Three Tigers Gang, will not tolerate it! "</p><p></p><p>"You, go and gather all the members of the gang. I'm going to find the Big Gang Leader and the Second Gang Leader, and this time we must demand an explanation from the other two forces. Do they really think the Three Tigers Gang is made of mud?"</p><p></p><p>"I must help Elder Brother Bear settle this score!"</p><p></p><p>The subordinate heard this and was shocked, not expecting the death of Elder Brother Bear to anger the Third Gang Leader to such an extent...</p><p></p><p>Yongye Island is about to change!</p><p></p><p>...</p><p></p><p>For the fastest updates on flawless novels, please visit www.feixs.com</p><p></p><p>For mobile access, please visit: https://m.feixs.com/chapter-45751-38225604</p>

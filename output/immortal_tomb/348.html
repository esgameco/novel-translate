        <h1>Chapter 348</h1>
        <div class="content">
            <p>Here is the full English translation of the Chinese excerpt:</p><p></p><p>"Huh?</p><p></p><p>Lord Golden Wheel or Lord Mace Saint came to personally invite me?"</p><p></p><p>Zhou Dafa was shocked, watching the figure in blue robes disappear around the corner of the stairs. 69§hµx.¢ðm</p><p></p><p>Who among the billions of cultivators in the human race would dare to speak with such arrogance?</p><p></p><p>Today, he had the rare opportunity to witness this.</p><p></p><p>However, Zhou Dafa thought that perhaps the senior in blue robes was new to this place and did not fully understand the concept of the Five Overlords of the human race.</p><p></p><p>As for Han Jinlong, after the initial surprise, he shook his head and chuckled, not feeling any anger.</p><p></p><p>Han Jinlong's thoughts were not much different from Zhou Dafa's, believing that Lu Changsheng was new to the divine-demonic battlefield and his understanding was not yet clear.</p><p></p><p>"Haha, young man, a bit of arrogance is good..." </p><p></p><p>Han Jinlong said with a flicker in his eyes as he disappeared from his seat.</p><p></p><p>This young friend Lu did not know that he was actually the Lord Golden Wheel himself...</p><p></p><p>In any case, they must find a way to keep this young friend Lu in the Human City.</p><p></p><p>Soon, only Zhou Dafa was left at the window-side table, and he relaxed his body after noticing the disappearance of the man in the black robe.</p><p></p><p>"Ah, that senior in the black robe hasn't paid the bill, has he?"</p><p></p><p>Zhou Dafa's expression changed slightly as he realized this important detail.</p><p></p><p>...</p><p></p><p>At the same time, in the main palace of the Human City, by the lake, the moment Han Jinlong appeared, his black robe transformed into a dazzling golden battle armor, his youthful appearance changing back to a middle-aged man, and his stature growing taller.</p><p></p><p>"Where has the Lord Golden Wheel come from?"</p><p></p><p>Suddenly, a calm young voice sounded from the other side of the lake.</p><p></p><p>Han Jinlong furrowed his brows and looked towards the other side of the lake, seeing a young man standing upright with his hands behind his back, wearing a bright silver battle armor.</p><p></p><p>At this moment, the young man's eagle-like eyes were gazing at him.</p><p></p><p>Seeing this, Han Jinlong let out a distant snort: "What, does the Mace Saint need to be greeted by me whenever I go somewhere?"</p><p></p><p>Yan Jueyi's expression remained impassive as a silver staff emitting a cold light appeared in his palm.</p><p></p><p>The surface of the silver staff was engraved with dense symbols, indicating it was no ordinary weapon.</p><p></p><p>"Lord Golden Wheel, have you forgotten what day it is today?"</p><p></p><p>Oh?</p><p></p><p>Han Jinlong looked at the Profound Silver Trembling Heaven Staff in Yan Jueyi's hand, his eyes narrowing. He had indeed forgotten that today was the day they would spar.</p><p></p><p>Immediately, his aura trembled, and two tarnished golden wheels appeared floating above his palms, slowly rotating.</p><p></p><p>The Scorching Yang Heaven Wheels!</p><p></p><p>Han Jinlong's title of Lord Golden Wheel was closely related to the Scorching Yang Heaven Wheels.</p><p></p><p>Yan Jueyi's title of Mace Saint also originated from his Profound Silver Trembling Heaven Staff.</p><p></p><p>The two of them, as two of the Five Overlords of the human race, were renowned in the divine-demonic battlefield for their Scorching Yang Heaven Wheels and Profound Silver Trembling Heaven Staff.</p><p></p><p>The Five Overlords of the human race each had their own unique characteristics.</p><p></p><p>Apart from Han Jinlong and Yan Jueyi, </p><p></p><p>the Tyrant King Bai Tian excelled in both body and cultivation, though he was more focused on his physical body, similar to Li Shuo-yan, though Li Shuo-yan's realm and physique were currently no match for Bai Tian's.</p><p></p><p>The Revered Wind Xiang Wuxin was skilled in speed, and although he was not at the top of the individual combat power ranking like the others, his Wind Lightning Instant God Step was highly renowned, allowing him to be among the fastest in the entire divine-demonic battlefield.</p><p></p><p>Lastly, there was Jian Wuhui, the leader of the Five Overlords, a sword cultivator whose combat power was the strongest among the five, and he was even ranked on the individual combat power list.</p><p></p><p>"Haha haha." Han Jinlong first let out a loud laugh, then sighed helplessly, "This king..."</p><p></p><p>Here is the full English translation of the Chinese excerpt:</p><p></p><p>"Wang Ziran had not forgotten, 'Come, this time I'll make sure to subdue you, so you won't keep bothering me!' </p><p></p><p>At the same time, he was feeling quite troubled in his heart. This Yan Jueyi was truly a battle-crazed maniac, even surpassing Mang Tian when it came to his love for fighting!</p><p></p><p>Yan Jueyi didn't just fight with him alone, he would come looking for a fight every few years, challenging Mang Tian and Fengxing Zun as well, all under the pretext of testing his progress.</p><p></p><p>This guy, when he goes berserk, there was even a time when he went after Lord Jian, but after being easily defeated by just a few strokes of Lord Jian's sword, he didn't dare make a sound.</p><p></p><p>"Hehe, subdue me? With your abilities? Among our human race, aside from Lord Jian, who else can subdue me!" Yan Jueyi sneered coldly, gripping his Xuanyin Shaking Heaven Staff as he suddenly vanished from the opposite shore.</p><p></p><p>Instantly, the space began to fluctuate, and the entire lake started to boil.</p><p></p><p>Seeing this, Han Jinlong's eyes narrowed, not daring to be careless!</p><p></p><p>The next moment, carrying two blazing Solar Wheels, he too disappeared from the original spot.</p><p></p><p>Clang clang clang—!</p><p></p><p>Soon, this space erupted with continuous, ear-piercing sounds of clashing weapons, shaking the heavens and earth, the lake violently churning, the splashing water like towering waves.</p><p></p><p>Fortunately, this space had been specially reinforced long ago, able to isolate everything, otherwise this commotion might have attracted the attention of the entire human city.</p><p></p><p>...</p><p></p><p>After an unknown duration, the disturbance in the space finally settled down, and the boiling lake waters also returned to calmness.</p><p></p><p>"Swoosh!"</p><p></p><p>At this time, the figures of Han Jinlong and Yan Jueyi suddenly reappeared on the two shores of the lake.</p><p></p><p>Both were in tattered clothes, panting heavily, but Han Jinlong seemed a bit more disheveled.</p><p></p><p>Han Jinlong looked at Yan Jueyi with a solemn gaze, feeling that this guy had grown stronger again...</p><p></p><p>Truly a battle-crazed maniac, at this rate, Yan Jueyi would eventually surpass him, Mang Wang, and Fengxing Zun.</p><p></p><p>"Gold Wheel King, how do you feel?" From the other side, Yan Jueyi put away his Xuanyin Shaking Heaven Staff, finally revealing a smile on his face.</p><p></p><p>Through their just-concluded bout, he was satisfied with the verification.</p><p></p><p>Hearing this, Han Jinlong's brows furrowed, and he pretentiously brushed off his golden battle armor, disdainfully saying, "It's just so-so, Cudgel Saint, you're still far from good enough!"</p><p></p><p>Yan Jueyi smiled indifferently, as the human city was jointly commanded by the two of them, so he was already accustomed to Han Jinlong's stubbornness.</p><p></p><p>He then took a step forward, crossing the lake to stand beside Han Jinlong, glancing at him before slowly walking towards a nearby pavilion, taking a seat and pouring himself a cup of wine.</p><p></p><p>"Gold Wheel King, what business did you have at that Xianhe Wine House today?"</p><p></p><p>Han Jinlong's eyes flickered, not feeling particularly surprised.</p><p></p><p>After all, as the Cudgel Saint, it was difficult for any happenings in the human city to escape his notice, let alone when Han Jinlong was the Gold Wheel King himself.</p><p></p><p>Han Jinlong walked into the pavilion, sitting across from Yan Jueyi. "You already know, why bother asking me, Your Holiness? Just looking to have some fun?"</p><p></p><p>Yan Jueyi's expression remained neutral as he said, "The incident that occurred at the Plaza Battle Platform a few days ago has naturally already reached my ears. Since the Gold Wheel King has met that Azure-robed Cultivator, why don't you tell me about him?"</p><p></p><p>Hearing this, Han Jinlong sighed and smiled, "That young friend Lu is no simple person. Although he is new to the Divine-Demonic Battlefield, his cultivation is already at the Divine Profound Realm, ranking among the top three on our human city's battle rankings, I estimate."</p><p></p><p>Oh?</p><p></p><p>Yan Jueyi's gaze shifted, this person was new to the Divine-Demonic Battlefield? No wonder even he hadn't heard of him before.</p><p></p><p>And what Han Jinlong said, that this person could rank among the top three on the battle rankings?</p><p></p><p>Such strength, among the human race, aside from the five of them as the Overlords, would only be found in that top-tier group.</p>

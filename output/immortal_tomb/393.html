        <h1>Chapter 393</h1>
        <div class="content">
            <p>Here is the full English translation of the Chinese excerpt:</p><p></p><p>At the Cliff.</p><p></p><p>Shenyue looked at the returning Shenxing and asked, "Has the Deity Imprisonment Formation been activated?"</p><p></p><p>"It has, right here at the cliff," Shenxing replied, vigilantly surveying the surroundings. He quickly asked again, "Grand Priest, should we notify the entire clan and have everyone on high alert?"</p><p></p><p>"No need, once there's any movement, the entire clan will know. Telling them now won't be of much use, after all, these Clan Elders like Biyou are just looking for the two of us."</p><p></p><p>Shenyue finished speaking, suddenly feeling subtle fluctuations in the space. His expression gradually became grave: "They're here!"</p><p></p><p>Shenxing's face changed slightly, about to say something, when suddenly the space behind the cliff began to ripple, and nine majestic figures slowly emerged... </p><p></p><p>They were Biyou, Aozhengtian, and the other Clan Elders!</p><p></p><p>Shenyue and Shenxing's gazes were solemn, wanting to say something, but the nine Clan Elders charged at them without a word, their overwhelming pressure blanketing everything!</p><p></p><p>The nine Clan Elders actually wanted to subdue them instantly!!</p><p></p><p>It seems they wanted to directly capture the two of them and extract the whereabouts of the Deity Monarch's seclusion!</p><p></p><p>"Second Priest!" </p><p></p><p>Shenyue urgently shouted.</p><p></p><p>Facing the powerful nine Clan Elders, he couldn't afford to not be urgent!!</p><p></p><p>These were nine Deity Warrior realm experts after all!</p><p></p><p>Biyou, the Devouring Beast Clan Elder, and Aozhengtian, the Dragon Clan Elder, were even late-stage Deity Warrior existences!</p><p></p><p>At this moment, without Shenyue needing to say anything, Shenxing understood. He roared, "While we may not be able to match your strength, the Deity Monarch had long anticipated this day!"</p><p></p><p>"Deity Imprisonment Formation, Heavenly Binding Chains, activate!!"</p><p></p><p>Clang clang clang clang clang—!</p><p></p><p>Countless illusory chains surged out from all directions of the space at an extreme speed, reaching the nine Clan Elders in the blink of an eye!</p><p></p><p>The nine Clan Elders' expressions turned grave, but there wasn't too much surprise in their hearts. They had long guessed that the Deity Clan would have some methods, as the Deity Monarch was no fool.</p><p></p><p>It's just that time waits for no one, they had rushed here without much time to research and prepare.</p><p></p><p>In a flash, the nine Clan Elders frantically shattered the illusory chains that were trying to bind them, but these chains seemed endless!!</p><p></p><p>Seeing this, Shenxing burst into laughter: "This is our Deity Clan's territory, the Deity Monarch had already said that the Deity Imprisonment Formation can hold back even late-stage Deity Warrior experts, and it's not deceiving us!!"</p><p></p><p>Beside him, Shenyue's brows were slightly furrowed, not as optimistic as Shenxing.</p><p></p><p>How long this Deity Imprisonment Formation could last, he didn't know...</p><p></p><p>Rumble—</p><p></p><p>Suddenly, the sky of the Deity Clan thundered. Immediately after, countless thick black lightning bolts mercilessly struck the cliff area!</p><p></p><p>The terrifying commotion at the cliff caused the entire Deity Clan to tremble and be alarmed, all the Deity Clan members flapping their wings and rushing towards the cliff without hesitation.</p><p></p><p>But Shenyue's voice immediately rang out: </p><p></p><p>"Don't come over!!"</p><p></p><p>The Deity Clan members instantly halted their steps, not daring to approach any further, but they also didn't leave, their gazes fixed on the cliff in horror.</p><p></p><p>In their line of sight, the black lightning was raging, the chains endless, making it impossible to see the situation clearly.</p><p></p><p>.........</p><p></p><p>Within the Deity Imprisonment Formation, the nine Clan Elders' expressions remained calm as they evaded the black lightning and chains.</p><p></p><p>This formation wasn't too much of a threat to them, but the key was that the nature of this formation was a confinement array. Apart from the black lightning and chains, they couldn't see the outside world either, feeling as if they were trapped in a deep abyss, always on the defensive.</p><p></p><p>It had to be said that they were indeed temporarily held back, unable to spare the time to capture the two Grand Priests!</p><p></p><p>The more this was the case, the more anxious they became, always feeling that the time they had left was not much!</p><p></p><p>The root cause of all this was that they had acted too hastily, their preparations not thorough enough.</p><p></p><p>"This won't do, being dragged on like this..."</p><p></p><p>Here is the full English translation of the Chinese excerpt:</p><p></p><p>"No way!!" Ao Zhengtian smashed a lock chain with a palm strike and said, "We have to find a way to locate the formation's eye!"</p><p></p><p>Regarding this, the clan leaders all knew, but to be honest, none of them were proficient in formation techniques.</p><p></p><p>The Heavenly God Monarch had obviously calculated their every move, that old fox.</p><p></p><p>"Clan leaders, please help me guard the formation, I'll give it a try," the Crow Clan Leader suddenly said in a deep voice.</p><p></p><p>Huh??</p><p></p><p>Ao Zhengtian and the other clan leaders looked at the Crow Clan Leader with surprised and doubtful eyes. When did this old fellow learn formation techniques?</p><p></p><p>Seeing their reaction, the Crow Clan Leader said helplessly while evading the thunderbolts and chains, "It's not that I've learned formation techniques, but I have a technique that might be useful, let's give it a try."</p><p></p><p>"Okay, Crow Clan Leader, go ahead and try. These thunderbolts and chains won't hurt you, don't worry!" Bi You quickly said.</p><p></p><p>"Alright."</p><p></p><p>The Crow Clan Leader wasted no time, immediately sitting cross-legged in the air and closing his eyes!</p><p></p><p>The clan leaders saw this and surrounded the Crow Clan Leader, shielding him from all attacks.</p><p></p><p>The Crow Clan Leader suddenly made a hand seal, and then his entire body transformed into countless illusory crows, cawing as they flapped their wings and flew in all directions around the Restraining God Formation.</p><p></p><p>The thunderbolts and chains couldn't even touch those crows.</p><p></p><p>"Oh?"</p><p></p><p>The clan warriors saw this and their eyes lit up. This was a method!</p><p></p><p>Perhaps there was a chance!</p><p></p><p>...</p><p></p><p>"Haha, Grand Celestial, if these clan leaders had come out earlier, they would have done so by now... It seems that none of these clan leaders are proficient in formation techniques. The Heavenly God Monarch has really cornered them tightly," the Divine Star said, feeling extremely proud.</p><p></p><p>After all, making a group of powerful clan leaders helpless filled him with great self-satisfaction.</p><p></p><p>However, the expression on Divine Moon's face did not show much joy. He did not believe that a single formation could completely restrain these clan leaders, it was just a matter of time.</p><p></p><p>Thinking of this, Divine Moon looked towards a secret area within the Heavenly God Tribe, a trace of worry in his eyes.</p><p></p><p>I hope the Heavenly God Monarch can break through soon...</p><p></p><p>At the same time,</p><p></p><p>In a dark, secluded space within the Heavenly God Tribe, an elderly man with magnificent, spread wings had his eyes closed, calmly comprehending.</p><p></p><p>One could see a faint smile slowly appearing at the corners of his mouth.</p><p></p><p>This person was the supreme overlord of the Divine-Demonic Battlefield, the Heavenly God Monarch, Shen Ting!</p><p></p><p>Suddenly, Shen Ting opened his eyes, and terrifying marks flashed in his eyes!!</p><p></p><p>Shen Ting punched out, and the dark space instantly collapsed!</p><p></p><p>He flashed and appeared in the outside world, appearing in the sight of the gathered clan members!</p><p></p><p>"Heavenly God Monarch!" </p><p></p><p>Divine Moon, Divine Star, and the other clan members exclaimed in delight.</p><p></p><p>But Shen Ting had no time to pay attention to them, as he had not yet completed his breakthrough, needing just one last step!</p><p></p><p>Shen Ting looked up at the sky and coldly shouted, "I, Shen Ting, shall ascend to divinity today!!"</p><p></p><p>In the next instant, a massive Dao Celestial Projection appeared in the sky above the Heavenly God Tribe.</p><p></p><p>The Dao of the Divine-Demonic Battlefield!</p><p></p><p>"Heavenly God Tribe, Shen Ting, requests ascension to divinity, announced to all tribes."</p><p></p><p>The voice of the Dao resounded throughout the entire Divine-Demonic Battlefield, extremely solemn.</p><p></p><p>Ascension... to divinity...</p><p></p><p>All the tribes were shocked. Shen Ting's name was not unfamiliar to anyone, as he was the number one individual combat power!</p><p></p><p>As long as the Heavenly God Monarch succeeded in his divine ascension today, the Divine-Demonic Battlefield would witness the birth of the first Divine Realm expert in history, a true king who could crush all tribes.</p><p></p><p>Within the Restraining God Formation, the clan leaders heard the voices from outside become increasingly anxious!</p><p></p><p>Shen Ting's upcoming divine ascension would be their last chance!</p>

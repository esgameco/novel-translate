        <h1>Chapter 442</h1>
        <div class="content">
            <p>Here is the full English translation of the Chinese excerpt:</p><p></p><p>The next morning.</p><p></p><p>Ye Xun Mang, accompanied by Yun Ze Cang, Yun Ao Xie, and Ke Ning, came to the Observation Pavilion.</p><p></p><p>"Greetings to the King, Lord Ye, Prince Ninth Prince, Princess Ke Ning!" </p><p></p><p>The imperial guards were startled and quickly greeted them with a bow.</p><p></p><p>After Yun Ze Cang and the others entered the Observation Pavilion, the guards slowly stood up, their gazes puzzled, not knowing why the King and his entourage had come to the Observation Pavilion so early in the morning.</p><p></p><p>Inside the Observation Pavilion, Yun Ze Cang and the others walked and chatted.</p><p></p><p>"Uncle Ye, when will you return after leaving?" Yun Ao Xie couldn't help but ask.</p><p></p><p>Ye Xun Mang smiled: "Even I don't know, but if there's no major issue, I might return quite soon."</p><p></p><p>However, Ye Xun Mang had a premonition. He had already severed ties with his clan, yet the clan was still summoning him back based on the bloodline imprint, which meant the matter must be quite serious. This did not mean Ye Xun Mang was particularly important, but rather that the situation was indeed grave, and the clan had probably summoned all its members outside the clan.</p><p></p><p>"Brother, if you need anything, be sure to discuss it with me. In a while, I will apply for a commissioner's position in the Alliance of Ten Thousand Nations." Yun Ze Cang patted Ye Xun Mang's shoulder.</p><p></p><p>"Brother, don't worry." Ye Xun Mang said warmly, smiling.</p><p></p><p>Yun Ze Cang was stunned for a moment, then smiled gently. After all, this younger brother of his usually only addressed him as "Your Majesty," rarely calling him "brother."</p><p></p><p>Seeing Ke Ning silent beside him, Yun Ao Xie couldn't help but ask, "Ke Ning, what's on your mind?"</p><p></p><p>Ke Ning snapped out of her thoughts and shook her head: "Brother, you're overthinking it."</p><p></p><p>Soon, they arrived outside Luo Chang Sheng's room.</p><p></p><p>Hearing the commotion, the old turtle came out of his room, looking puzzled at Yun Ze Cang and the others: "So early in the morning, what are you all here for?"</p><p></p><p>"Senior Turtle!" </p><p></p><p>Yun Ze Cang and the others quickly greeted him with a bow.</p><p></p><p>Then Yun Ze Cang smiled and replied, "Senior Turtle, it's because this wise brother of mine is about to leave the Ancient Country of Cloud Mist, so he's come to bid you farewell."</p><p></p><p>The old turtle was slightly surprised, looking at Ye Xun Mang: "Little Ye, you're leaving?"</p><p></p><p>Ye Xun Mang slightly bowed and replied, "Yes, the clan has summoned me back for a matter."</p><p></p><p>The old turtle nodded, then gestured for everyone to step back a bit, and then knocked lightly on Luo Chang Sheng's door, respectfully saying:</p><p></p><p>"Master, Little Ye is about to leave the Ancient Country of Cloud Mist and has come to bid you farewell."</p><p></p><p>Creak,</p><p></p><p>Soon, Luo Chang Sheng stepped out.</p><p></p><p>Yun Ze Cang and the others were slightly startled, quickly kneeling in a worshipful salute: "Greetings, Master!"</p><p></p><p>Ke Ning knelt there, her heart pounding, wanting to look up but daring not to. </p><p></p><p>In her life, before meeting the Gentleman in Blue at the Observation Pavilion, she had never had any feelings. However, Ke Ning knew that between her and the Gentleman in Blue, there was an insurmountable chasm. Or to put it bluntly, she was not worthy.</p><p></p><p>Ke Ning would not be presumptuous. She could only bury this affection deep in her heart, and being able to catch a glimpse of him from afar would be enough.</p><p></p><p>"Master, Xun Mang is about to leave the Ancient Country of Cloud Mist and has come to bid you farewell," Ye Xun Mang kowtowed to the ground, respectfully saying.</p><p></p><p>Ye Xun Mang was waiting for Luo Chang Sheng's permission, but suddenly heard Luo Chang Sheng softly say:</p><p></p><p>"I'll go back with you."</p><p></p><p>Ah?</p><p></p><p>Not only Ye Xun Mang and the others were stunned, even the old turtle's eyes flashed with bewilderment. He never expected Luo Chang Sheng to suddenly say this, the master really doesn't play by the rules!</p><p></p><p>Luo Chang Sheng didn't ask Ye Xun Mang, but simply walked towards the Observation Terrace with his hands behind his back.</p><p></p><p>"What are you standing there for, let's go!" The old turtle grabbed the dazed Ye Xun Mang and chased after Luo Chang Sheng.</p><p></p><p>Yun Ze Cang and the others also quickly got up and followed.</p><p></p><p>Yun Ao Xie suddenly noticed Ke Ning's complexion was a bit pale and couldn't help but ask worriedly, "Ke Ning, what's wrong with you?"</p><p></p><p>Ke Ning was silent for a while, then forced a smile and said, "Brother, I'm fine, I'm just... a bit reluctant to see Uncle Ye leave."</p><p></p><p>Yun Ao Xie nodded skeptically. </p><p></p><p>Didn't he just not see any reluctance just now?</p><p></p><p>...</p><p></p><p>On the Observation Terrace.</p><p></p><p>Luo Chang Sheng and the old turtle stood on the stone wall, watching the group bidding farewell.</p><p></p><p>"Brother, you don't need to see me off..."</p><p></p><p>Here is the full English translation of the Chinese excerpt:</p><p></p><p>"I cannot keep the elder waiting any longer."</p><p></p><p>Ye Xunwang made a bow.</p><p></p><p>Yunze Cang glanced at Lu Changsheng cautiously, then quickly waved his hand and said, "Then my worthy brother should go."</p><p></p><p>Ye Xunwang nodded, then gestured to Yun Daoxie and Kening, and quickly climbed up the stone wall, summoning a sedan chair and bowing to invite Lu Changsheng, "My lord, please."</p><p></p><p>Lu Changsheng nodded slightly and stepped into the sedan chair.</p><p></p><p>Kening could only see the figure sitting in the sedan chair through the curtain, and her heart trembled slightly.</p><p></p><p>Kening had a premonition that she might never see him again.</p><p></p><p>The old turtle perceptively sensed Kening's emotions, his eyes flickering, sighing inwardly, another infatuated young lady.</p><p></p><p>Unfortunately, he was just a passing guest, and could only be a passing guest. He knew his master too well.</p><p></p><p>The old turtle knew that if he could perceive it, let alone the master, the master must have noticed it long ago.</p><p></p><p>But fortunately, the master's demeanor was very indifferent and natural, leaving no room for any thoughts.</p><p></p><p>Afterwards, the old turtle and Ye Xunwang boarded the sedan chair.</p><p></p><p>"Daoxie, next time there's a chance, let's invite Grandpa Turtle to play, no problem, right?" The old turtle winked at Yun Daoxie.</p><p></p><p>"It's a small matter! As long as Grandpa Turtle comes to the Cloud Mist Kingdom, everything else can be left to Daoxie!" Yun Daoxie patted his chest and laughed.</p><p></p><p>"Haha, good boy!" The old turtle gave him a big thumbs up.</p><p></p><p>"Brother, then this worthy brother will take his leave!"</p><p></p><p>Ye Xunwang bowed, and then the sedan chair suddenly shot out from the Observation Platform, disappearing into the distance like a flash of light!</p><p></p><p>"Farewell, my lord!"</p><p></p><p>Yunze Cang stood up and murmured towards the sky, "Daoxie, this time your Uncle Ye's return to the clan is definitely not that simple..."</p><p></p><p>Hearing this, Yun Daoxie paused, then became worried, "Father, that Uncle Ye..."</p><p></p><p>Yunze Cang shook his head and smiled, "But fortunately, the Azure Robe Lord is accompanying him. Although I don't know why the Azure Robe Lord is going with your Uncle Ye, but I know that with the Azure Robe Lord there, your Uncle Ye's situation will be much more comfortable."</p><p></p><p>"Father, what is the lord's name?" The silent Kening suddenly asked.</p><p></p><p>Yunze Cang and Yun Daoxie were stumped, and finally exchanged a bitter smile.</p><p></p><p>They didn't know...</p><p></p><p>Kening pressed her lips together and lowered her head, unable to hide her disappointment.</p><p></p><p>They don't even know his name, why does it feel like the Azure Robe man has appeared before, but also hasn't?</p><p></p><p>But the memories in her mind are so clear.</p><p></p><p>...</p><p></p><p>In the sea of clouds in the sky, the sedan chair like a golden beam of light, shuttling freely.</p><p></p><p>The sedan chair may look small from the outside, but the space inside is quite spacious.</p><p></p><p>At the moment, the three of them were sitting and drinking in the sedan chair, but Ye Xunwang was a little restrained.</p><p></p><p>"Little Ye, where is your clan located, and how long will it take to get to your clan?" The old turtle asked casually.</p><p></p><p>Ye Xunwang calmed himself and replied, "Grandpa Turtle, the Ye Clan is hidden in an ancient realm called the Void Ancient Realm in the Qiankun Heavens, and as for how long... Well, Xunwang is not sure, but at the current speed, it shouldn't take too long."</p><p></p><p>"The Void Ancient Realm? Sounds like there's some background to it. Is your Ye Clan that powerful?" The old turtle asked suspiciously.</p><p></p><p>Ye Xunwang smiled bitterly, "Grandpa Turtle has misunderstood, the Void Ancient Realm is not just the Ye Clan, there are many ancient clans there, with powerful experts everywhere. Even when Xunwang left the Void Ancient Realm, the Ye Clan was only at the middle level among the ancient clans there."</p><p></p><p>The old turtle nodded and didn't say anything more, seeming to be in deep thought.</p><p></p><p>Ye Xunwang saw this and carefully glanced at the quiet Lu Changsheng drinking wine, gathering his courage to ask, "My lord, Xunwang is truly curious, why are you accompanying Xunwang back to the clan?"</p><p></p><p>Lu Changsheng put down his wine cup and suddenly smiled kindly, "Don't be nervous, I just have some matters to attend to."</p>

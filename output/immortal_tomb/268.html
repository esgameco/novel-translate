        <h1>Chapter 268</h1>
        <div class="content">
            <p>Here is the full English translation of the Chinese excerpt:</p><p></p><p>"Your Lordship must be one of the cultivators from the Six Great Divine Realms. I wonder why Your Lordship has entered our Endless Demonic Abyss without cause?" said one of the young men coldly.</p><p></p><p>In the Ancestral Celestial Realm, falling into the Gloomy Demon Sea, the Endless Demonic Abyss, the Six Great Divine Realms have always maintained a peaceful coexistence.</p><p></p><p>Normally, the cultivators from the Six Great Divine Realms would not enter their Demonic Abyss without reason...</p><p></p><p>It has only been a few years since the calamity that befell the Ancestral Celestial Realm.</p><p></p><p>Could it be that Emperor Yintiao is about to start plotting again?</p><p></p><p>"Are your eyes just for show? I've come here naturally to collect some herbs," Lu Changsheng said with a faint smile.</p><p></p><p>Collect herbs?</p><p></p><p>The two young men looked at Xiaotong blankly.</p><p></p><p>Their Endless Demonic Abyss has accumulated a vast amount of medicinal herbs, as no ordinary person dares to venture in, and they, being demonic beings, have no use for them.</p><p></p><p>However...</p><p></p><p>"Your Lordship, to enter our domain and collect herbs without even a word of greeting, would that not be impolite? You should know that even if it's a Divine Emperor, they must first inform our Demon Emperor before coming!" the young man said coldly.</p><p></p><p>"Your Lordship, please depart quickly. We will overlook this incident for today," the other young man said.</p><p></p><p>It's not that they are kind-hearted, but they have already sensed that Lu Changsheng is no ordinary person, and out of fear, they dare not act rashly against him.</p><p></p><p>If Lu Changsheng had appeared weak, they would have instantly torn him to shreds!</p><p></p><p>"Who says this place is your domain? I say it's mine," Lu Changsheng said with amusement.</p><p></p><p>Hearing this, the two young men understood the implication differently!</p><p></p><p>So Emperor Yintiao is indeed plotting something!</p><p></p><p>He is not satisfied with the Six Great Divine Realms and now wants to claim the Endless Demonic Abyss as his own!</p><p></p><p>"Your Lordship, you have indeed come with a purpose. Then you shall not be leaving today!" </p><p></p><p>The two young men's faces turned ferocious as they immediately crushed the jade pendants in their hands, transmitting the news to the Demon Emperor!</p><p></p><p>They were guarding the edges of the Endless Demonic Abyss precisely to guard against Emperor Yintiao.</p><p></p><p>Now that the situation has changed, this earth-shaking event must be reported!</p><p></p><p>Boom!</p><p></p><p>The next moment, they manifested into towering hundreds-of-zhang demons, their sharp fangs gleaming with cold light!</p><p></p><p>Xiaotong had already stiffened to the side, staring blankly up at the towering demons, her heart almost stopping from fear.</p><p></p><p>She had never seen such a terrifying sight.</p><p></p><p>Lu Changsheng casually waved his hand, bringing the frightened Xiaotong behind him.</p><p></p><p>Then, with a slight smile, he gently pressed down with his palm.</p><p></p><p>Xiaotong was shocked to see the two towering demons' bodies collapse, their bones shattering with a dense, bone-chilling scream!</p><p></p><p>Rumble.</p><p></p><p>The two towering demons crashed to the ground, triggering a massive tremor as they were forcefully suppressed by a mysterious power.</p><p></p><p>The hearts of the two young men in their demonic forms were filled with terror!</p><p></p><p>After all, they were not ordinary beings even in the Endless Demonic Abyss, but in front of the young man in green, they didn't even have a chance to strike!</p><p></p><p>What's going on? They recognized the Twelve Guardians of the Divine Emperor's Palace, but they had no impression of this young man in green at all!</p><p></p><p>"Who dares to trespass in my Demonic Abyss!!" </p><p></p><p>At this moment, a majestic roar echoed.</p><p></p><p>The next moment, a black-robed elder appeared. He glanced at the two suppressed demons and his gaze narrowed, his malicious aura rising.</p><p></p><p>"Demon Emperor Lord!" </p><p></p><p>The two demons exclaimed in joy, then trembled as they reported:</p><p></p><p>"Demon Emperor Lord, this person is extremely powerful, he must be sent by Emperor Yintiao!!"</p><p></p><p>"Good, Yintiao! Since he wants to stir up a great war, then so be it! Rest assured, today I will stand up for you!" </p><p></p><p>The Demon Emperor let out a cold snort, then turned to look over, exuding an overbearing aura.</p><p></p><p>But the next moment, he knelt down with a thud.</p><p></p><p>The two demons were dumbfounded.</p><p></p><p>But when they heard the Demon Emperor's trembling voice, their pupils shrank sharply.</p><p></p><p>"Senior, Senior, Senior Lu... You came to the Demonic Abyss without even informing this old fellow in advance, so that I could prepare to welcome you properly."</p><p></p><p>Hearing this, the two demons trembled as they looked at Lu Changsheng.</p><p></p><p>This person, this person is actually...</p><p></p><p>The Demon Emperor was now almost scared out of his wits, truly afraid that the mighty figure before him would overturn his Endless Demonic Abyss.</p><p></p><p>Lu Changsheng waved his hand and said leisurely, "Oh, so you know me. Since you know, why haven't you come to pay your respects in all this time?"</p><p></p><p>The Demon Emperor's heart trembled, and he stammered, "This old fellow actually wanted to visit Senior Lu, but the Six Great Divine Realms are Yintiao's domain, and this old fellow was afraid of causing misunderstandings if he went over..."</p><p></p><p>"I see." Lu Changsheng looked at him indifferently, as if exerting infinite pressure without even doing anything.</p><p></p><p>"I've only come here today to collect some herbs, yet your two subordinates wanted to attack me. What is the meaning of this?"</p><p></p><p>The Demon Emperor's head was spinning, he didn't believe Lu Changsheng's words at all.</p><p></p><p>He felt that Lu Changsheng's herb collecting was just a pretext, and the real purpose was to show his might.</p><p></p><p>"It's all a misunderstanding, a complete misunderstanding, Senior Lu! They are nothing, how dare they try to attack Senior Lu. It's all a misunderstanding!" The Demon Emperor frantically explained.</p><p></p><p>If this matter was escalated by Lu Changsheng to the level of confrontation, then his Endless Demonic Abyss would be in grave danger.</p><p></p><p>The two demons were now completely terrified.</p><p></p><p>If it weren't for the Demon Emperor, whom they had always seen as high and mighty, now kneeling on the ground begging...</p><p></p><p>Here is my translation of the Chinese excerpt:</p><p></p><p>It was like a dog,</p><p></p><p>The new 69 bookstore ‚Üí 69ùìàùíΩùìäùìç.ùí∏‚Ñ¥ùìÇ</p><p></p><p>They all had a hard time believing that this was the ruthless person who destroyed the Heavenly Dao.</p><p></p><p>But the facts were right in front of them, leaving no room for disbelief.</p><p></p><p>"Alright, you all can leave now, I really just came to pick some herbs, I'll be gone soon." Lu Changsheng casually dismissed them, while also withdrawing the suppressing force on the two demons.</p><p></p><p>"Yes, yes, yes... Senior Lu, would you like to come sit with the old man for a bit?" The Demon Emperor said very cautiously.</p><p></p><p>As arrogant as he was at first, now he was as humble as can be.</p><p></p><p>"If you haven't left in three breaths, then don't..." Lu Changsheng said impatiently, not wanting to be polite.</p><p></p><p>But before he could finish, the three demons had already swiftly fled.</p><p></p><p>"Don't just stand there, quickly gather the herbs, you shouldn't be disturbed anymore."</p><p></p><p>Lu Changsheng smiled at Xiao Tong.</p><p></p><p>"Uh, yes."</p><p></p><p>...</p><p></p><p>A few days later.</p><p></p><p>Outside Yaoyu Town.</p><p></p><p>Lu Changsheng stood there smiling, with Old Turtle, Tongxin, and Li Shuyuan silently standing behind him.</p><p></p><p>Facing them were Xiao Tong and all the Yaoyu Town residents, who seemed to have put down whatever they were doing for the day.</p><p></p><p>They all held something in their hands, whether it was a bag of buns, a box, oiled paper, or a wooden crate.</p><p></p><p>"Doctor Lu... Are you really leaving so soon?" </p><p></p><p>Luo Gu held a large bag of buns and said softly.</p><p></p><p>The townspeople looked at the young man in green with reluctance. Doctor Lu was so kind, a great benefactor. Ever since he came to Yaoyu, no one had to worry about illness anymore.</p><p></p><p>"Don't worry, Xiao Tong's medical skills are now on par with mine. Even when I'm gone, you all don't have to go through the trouble of traveling to other towns to see a doctor."</p><p></p><p>Lu Changsheng scanned the crowd and said warmly.</p><p></p><p>The townspeople were stunned, looking at Xiao Tong, their eyes reddening involuntarily. Then, in unison, they knelt down before Lu Changsheng.</p><p></p><p>They opened their mouths, but the words were stuck in their throats.</p><p></p><p>Lu Changsheng gently waved his sleeve, helping the townspeople back up. He looked at Luo Gu and the other elders, smiling as he said, "You few don't have many years left anyway, you need to restrain yourselves in some matters, understand?"</p><p></p><p>Luo Gu and the other old men's faces flushed, and they quickly agreed.</p><p></p><p>"Haha..." The crowd burst into laughter at the sight.</p><p></p><p>The laughter came quickly and left just as fast.</p><p></p><p>Xiao Tong looked up at Lu Changsheng with reddened eyes. Lu Changsheng also looked at her with a gentle smile.</p><p></p><p>Seeing that familiar, kind face, Xiao Tong could no longer hold back. She respectfully bowed, her voice trembling,</p><p></p><p>"Thank you, sir, for curing Xiao Tong's congenital illness, thank you for teaching Xiao Tong medicine, thank you..."</p><p></p><p>Before she could continue, Lu Changsheng lifted her up: "No need to thank me."</p><p></p><p>He then turned and left.</p><p></p><p>"Everyone... Take care!" Tongxin said softly, then followed Old Turtle and the others after the young man in green.</p><p></p><p>The air fell silent for a moment, then the townspeople, holding their various packages, chased after them.</p><p></p><p>"Doctor Lu, Tongxin, take the buns with you, eat them on the way!"</p><p></p><p>"Hey, what's so good about these buns, buns every day, Doctor Lu, Tongxin, have some of my oil cakes!"</p><p></p><p>"Doctor Lu, we don't have anything precious left at home, these eggs, please take them..."</p><p></p><p>"......"</p><p></p><p>"Sir..." Tongxin looked to Lu Changsheng for instructions.</p><p></p><p>Lu Changsheng chuckled and waved his hand: "Take them all."</p><p></p><p>Tongxin beamed, quickly turning around.</p><p></p><p>Soon, it became quiet outside the town.</p><p></p><p>The townspeople watched the distant figure wistfully, where the young man in green had disappeared.</p><p></p><p>...</p><p></p><p>In the evening.</p><p></p><p>In the clinic, the candle flickered.</p><p></p><p>Xiao Tong sat alone at the long table, seriously studying the medical books by candlelight, gradually losing focus. She raised her head, staring blankly, the dimly lit clinic felt so empty.</p><p></p><p>Tongxin, who usually cleaned and maintained the place, was gone, as was the master who would nap in the rocking chair.</p><p></p><p>"They're all gone..."</p><p></p><p>A sense of indescribable loneliness swept over her, difficult to adapt to in the short term.</p><p></p><p>Tap, tap, tap...</p><p></p><p>Just then, footsteps sounded in the courtyard, slowly approaching the clinic.</p><p></p><p>Xiao Tong was startled, quickly running behind the counter to hide, peeking out with half her head anxiously towards the door.</p><p></p><p>Then she saw the middle-aged man in black armor, slowly walking towards her, murmuring, "Little miss, don't be afraid, uncle is really not a bad person..."</p><p></p><p>"Ah!!!"</p><p></p><p>Xiao Tong let out a shrill scream and ran towards the back garden.</p><p></p><p>Xing Tian was stunned for a moment, then slapped his own forehead, smiling bitterly,</p><p></p><p>"Uncle is really not a bad person, ah... I'm your father, you know..."</p><p></p><p>...</p><p></p><p>[The Clinic Arc Ends]</p><p></p><p>PS: Still the same old saying, free electricity generated by love, live to ninety-nine.</p>

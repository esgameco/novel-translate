        <h1>Chapter 93</h1>
        <div class="content">
            <p>Here is the full English translation of the Chinese excerpt:</p><p></p><p>Originally, Tiger Battle was going to launch a war against the Lingchen Realm, but after Luchang Sheng appeared and said those two sentences, he no longer dared to do so. üí¢‚ô£‚ùª‚ùæ‚ìà·ïºùêÆùîÅ.ùêÇ‚ìÑùî™üê∫üëç</p><p></p><p>In fact, even without Luchang Sheng, Tiger Battle was also somewhat unsure whether he could break open the Immortal Tomb.</p><p></p><p>However, previously it was because there was not too much risk, so trying it out wouldn't matter much. But now that Luchang Sheng, a presumed expert from the Immortal Realm, has appeared, going after it would carry the risk of perishing.</p><p></p><p>Tiger Battle's mind is well-developed, but his limbs are simple. He's not that stupid.</p><p></p><p>After hearing about the Howling Demon Tiger Clan from the Immortal Realm, Tiger Battle's thoughts were also ignited. He actually has a clan... and Luchang Sheng said there was his fortune there.</p><p></p><p>So he began to prepare for the Ascension Tribulation.</p><p></p><p>Since the Immortal Tomb is no longer obtainable, he'll go to the Immortal Realm instead.</p><p></p><p>There's nothing worth staying for in the Lower Realm anymore.</p><p></p><p>Before that, Tiger Battle appeared in the Lingchen Realm, bringing thick gifts to the Cultivation World of the Eastern Domain.</p><p></p><p>Tiger Battle told the sects of the Eastern Domain that after Elder Luchang's guidance, he deeply realized his mistakes and sincerely apologized.</p><p></p><p>The sects of the Eastern Domain were all dumbfounded. The mighty Demon Sovereign actually came in person to apologize with gifts... They were nervous and didn't know how to react.</p><p></p><p>And who is this Elder Luchang? Guiding the Demon Sovereign? It sounded so mystical.</p><p></p><p>But they still believed it, after all, the Demon Sovereign is such an extraordinary figure. Such a domineering character wouldn't casually mention an Elder Luchang who could overshadow him, and he wouldn't apologize for no reason.</p><p></p><p>In the end, Tiger Battle even threw out a big gift, sincerely inviting the sects of the Eastern Domain to witness his Ascension Tribulation in two years.</p><p></p><p>Seeing the clearly still dazed sects, Tiger Battle left with a smug expression on his face.</p><p></p><p>As soon as he left, the Patriarch of Purple Extreme Thunder Peak, Jiang Yuan, also appeared.</p><p></p><p>He also put aside his dignity, saying that after being guided by Elder Luchang, he apologized for not taking action during the previous demonic disaster at Purple Extreme Thunder Peak, and invited the sects to observe his Ascension Tribulation in five years.</p><p></p><p>Seeing such a figure as Jiang Yuan humble himself, the sects naturally forgave him.</p><p></p><p>But they were even more curious about this mysterious Elder Luchang.</p><p></p><p>The matter of the war has finally come to an end.</p><p></p><p>...</p><p></p><p>In the tenth year after Luchang Sheng came out of the Immortal Tomb in the Lingchen Realm, the Demon Sovereign Tiger Battle reached his Ascension Tribulation. Under the witness of Jiwuqing, the Demon and Immortal Realms, and the sects of the Eastern Domain, he went through the arduous trial and finally succeeded.</p><p></p><p>On this day, everyone finally saw the true form of the Demon Sovereign Tiger Battle - a monstrous tiger that blocked out the sky and sun!</p><p></p><p>In the thunderstorm, the demonic tiger opened its fangs and let out a roar that shook heaven and earth.</p><p></p><p>"Haha, Jiwuqing, Jiang Yuan, the descendants of my Demon Realm, and the cultivators of the Eastern Domain, we shall meet again!"</p><p></p><p>Saying that, Tiger Battle flashed and disappeared from the envious gaze of the crowd.</p><p></p><p>In the twelfth year,</p><p></p><p>The Patriarch of Purple Extreme Thunder Peak, Jiang Yuan, also successfully passed his Ascension Tribulation under the observation of countless cultivators.</p><p></p><p>Qin Miaomiao and Liu Wuxiu, seeing this, couldn't help but quicken their pace, feeling a bit anxious in their hearts.</p><p></p><p>Also in this year, the weather was overcast and rainy, and the old butler reached the end of his life...</p><p></p><p>"Master... The luckiest thing in this old servant's life was to have encountered such a kind master like you."</p><p></p><p>The old butler lay on the bed, smiling with an unusually ruddy complexion.</p><p></p><p>Chen Dadao tightly held his hand, head bowed without a word, his shoulders trembling violently.</p><p></p><p>"Four years ago, the Madam unfortunately passed away in the demonic disaster, and now this old servant is also leaving. From now on, it will just be you, Master..." The old butler squeezed Chen Dadao's hand and smiled.</p><p></p><p>Luchang Sheng stood by the side, his expression calm as he watched.</p><p></p><p>"Sir..."</p><p></p><p>Here is the full English translation of the Chinese excerpt:</p><p></p><p>The butler suddenly looked at Lu Changsheng and called out softly.</p><p></p><p>"During our time in Moyu Town, I thank the master for several times rescuing Moyu Town from danger. This servant knows the master is always tough on the outside but soft-hearted..."</p><p></p><p>Perhaps facing death, the old butler's tone was more natural when facing Lu Changsheng.</p><p></p><p>Lu Changsheng was taken aback for a moment, then smiled and said, "The world you will go to after death is called the Soul Realm. I know the leader of that world, and I will leave a trace of my spiritual energy on your soul. He will make arrangements for you then."</p><p></p><p>The butler's gaze began to blur, and he smiled, "Thank you, master."</p><p></p><p>"Butler! Butler!" Chen Dadao saw the butler's condition and instinctively turned around, kneeling in front of Lu Changsheng, kowtowing and trembling, "Master, can you save him? Please!"</p><p></p><p>Lu Changsheng pursed his lips and said softly, "He has reached the end of his lifespan."</p><p></p><p>"Master... my lord, this servant..." Before he could finish, the butler slowly closed his eyes, his face bearing no pain, only a smile and reluctance.</p><p></p><p>Chen Dadao's body trembled, suddenly turning around and standing there, his eyes reddened.</p><p></p><p>"Dadao, I'll ask you one more time, do you still want to cultivate immortality?"</p><p></p><p>At this point, Lu Changsheng walked over, used the quilt to cover the butler's face, and asked softly.</p><p></p><p>Dadao stared at Lu Changsheng's actions, trembling, "Master, I... I won't cultivate immortality anymore."</p><p></p><p>Lu Changsheng stood there for a long time, nodded, and left.</p><p></p><p>...</p><p></p><p>In the fourteenth year, the old woman's lifespan also reached its end.</p><p></p><p>"Grandma..." Little Tong's eyes were red as she gently held the old woman's frail hand.</p><p></p><p>Lu Changsheng was still there, just as he had been on the day the butler died, quietly watching from the side.</p><p></p><p>"Little Tong, you were born with a hard life. You were still young when your parents passed away, and your grandfather also passed away when you were three. You were selling fruit with Grandma at such a young age, those years were hard on you."</p><p></p><p>The old woman had a benevolent smile on her face, but her expression was somewhat ashamed.</p><p></p><p>Little Tong frantically shook her head, sobbing, "It wasn't hard at all, not even a bit! Grandma gave me all her love!"</p><p></p><p>The old woman proudly stroked Little Tong's cheek, "Hehe, my little Tong is successful. Although the days were tough, you still managed to become a government official and let Grandma enjoy a few years of comfort."</p><p></p><p>Little Tong held the old woman's hand tightly.</p><p></p><p>"Master, ever since that night when I met you, you secretly healed my eyes, and my and Little Tong's lives became much easier. I'm deeply grateful to you, if it weren't for you..."</p><p></p><p>Lu Changsheng waved his hand to interrupt, "Let's not dwell on the past."</p><p></p><p>The old woman smiled, but her gaze suddenly dimmed.</p><p></p><p>"Grandma... don't..." Tears streamed down Little Tong's face, her eyes swollen and red.</p><p></p><p>The old woman slightly parted her lips, wanting to say something more, but could not, and her eyes gently closed.</p><p></p><p>Little Tong was completely stunned, biting her lip hard until it bled, unaware.</p><p></p><p>"Brother, thank you for everything. It seems... Little Tong has to leave the Mortal Realm..."</p><p></p><p>At this moment, Little Tong's hair mysteriously turned a deep blue, and a hazy glow enveloped her.</p><p></p><p>Lu Changsheng was not surprised, and said calmly, "You don't need to thank me. Leave, your life in this world has ended."</p><p></p><p>Little Tong looked at the old woman on the bed, her expression cold, but her voice slightly trembling,</p><p></p><p>"I must depart now. Please, brother, take care of burying Grandma, and this..." </p><p></p><p>A string of blue beads floated in the air, and then she bowed slightly to Lu Changsheng. Her body suddenly dissolved into countless blue particles and disappeared from the room.</p><p></p><p>Lu Changsheng took the blue beads, turned around, and with a wave of his sleeve, the old woman's body vanished along with him.</p>

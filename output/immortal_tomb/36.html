        <h1>Chapter 36</h1>
        <div class="content">
            <p>Here is the full English translation of the Chinese excerpt:</p><p></p><p>Outside the backyard, the new 69 bookstore 99 SHUX.COM.</p><p></p><p>The King of the Underwater Kingdom carefully looked into the courtyard while holding a few bottles of wine, then tilted his head and gestured to Chen Daozhao.</p><p></p><p>Chen Daozhao sighed, cupped his hands and respectfully said to the courtyard, "Sir, the King and I request an audience."</p><p></p><p>"Come in."</p><p></p><p>Hearing this familiar voice, the two men exchanged a glance and heaved a deep sigh of relief.</p><p></p><p>They then stepped in cautiously.</p><p></p><p>Soon, they saw the suspended Abyss Demon Spear, and their pupils shrank sharply, feeling a chill down their spines.</p><p></p><p>Their vision also became blurred, as if they were about to be deeply drawn into it.</p><p></p><p>The two men were filled with terror. What was happening? They couldn't control the urge to look at the spear, but their consciousness was somewhat beyond their control.</p><p></p><p>Their current feeling was like being at the water's edge, suddenly grabbed by a water ghost on the leg and ruthlessly dragged into the water!</p><p></p><p>"Ahem."</p><p></p><p>Lu Changsheng, who was angling, suddenly coughed lightly.</p><p></p><p>Instantly, the feeling of Chen Daozhao and the King of the Underwater Kingdom disappeared!</p><p></p><p>They hurriedly averted their gaze from the Abyss Demon Spear, their faces deathly pale, panting heavily!</p><p></p><p>It was truly as if they had just walked through the gates of the underworld.</p><p></p><p>"This is a demonic creature. You ordinary mortals daring to observe it so closely, are you looking for death?" Lu Changsheng put down his fishing rod and turned to look at them with a light voice.</p><p></p><p>The King of the Underwater Kingdom and Chen Daozhao trembled and knelt down.</p><p></p><p>Before they could speak, Lu Changsheng said, "The deaths outside the town last night, and the neighboring country's demonic disturbance, you need not concern yourselves with."</p><p></p><p>The two men were stunned, and the King of the Underwater Kingdom said in a somewhat hoarse voice while bowing his head, "Sir, two hundred and twenty innocent civilians died last night..."</p><p></p><p>"Whether they were innocent or not, I know better than you." Lu Changsheng said indifferently.</p><p></p><p>The King of the Underwater Kingdom and Chen Daozhao admitted they were a bit confused.</p><p></p><p>"You may leave, do not disturb me with such trivial matters."</p><p></p><p>Lu Changsheng said and gradually disappeared into the pavilion.</p><p></p><p>The King of the Underwater Kingdom hesitated for a moment, then summoned up his courage and hurriedly said, "Sir, may I cultivate immortality?"</p><p></p><p>Chen Daozhao turned his head and looked at the King of the Underwater Kingdom blankly.</p><p></p><p>"No."</p><p></p><p>As the voice came, the King of the Underwater Kingdom's expression froze, and his mood became gloomy.</p><p></p><p>"Your Majesty..." Chen Daozhao wanted to comfort him.</p><p></p><p>The King of the Underwater Kingdom raised his hand to interrupt, and said in a low voice, "There's no need to comfort me, perhaps it is my destiny that I cannot cultivate immortality."</p><p></p><p>...</p><p></p><p>...</p><p></p><p>"Huh? The Nightmare Demon Tribe has also been wiped out?!"</p><p></p><p>Zhao Shenyuan stood up, his expression becoming unsettled.</p><p></p><p>He couldn't help but doubt his previous thoughts. Could it be that Qingyun Sect really did inform the cultivation world of the matter concerning the immortal tomb, and then some cultivators from other sects participated?</p><p></p><p>Otherwise, how could the Nightmare Demon Tribe in the Underwater Emperor Kingdom be exterminated in such a short time.</p><p></p><p>After all, the cultivators of Qingyun Sect in the Underwater Kingdom were all lured to other empires by the demonic beasts he had sent out...</p><p></p><p>Who was it then?</p><p></p><p>Zhao Shenyuan frowned, and this time, combined with the previous events, he detected a different flavor in it.</p><p></p><p>"No, I have to go and consult the Demon Sovereign."</p><p></p><p>Just as Zhao Shenyuan was about to set out, he saw Chu Qingcang appear in front of him, giggling, and couldn't help but frown and ask, "You, what are you here for at this time?"</p><p></p><p>"Hehe, Shenyuan, we demons and the demon realm..."</p><p></p><p>Here is the full English translation of the Chinese excerpt:</p><p></p><p>"Have you joined the alliance? The five great demonic kings have come to visit our Demon Realm, and the only one missing is you! Come, let me invite you," said Chu Qingcang, scratching his head.</p><p></p><p>"The five great demonic kings have come?" Zhao Shenyuan paused for a moment, then a bright light flashed in his eyes as he smiled and said, "Excellent, let's go. It's been a long time since I've seen those five fellows."</p><p></p><p>Chu Qingcang puzzled, "Shenyuan, why are you so happy? Didn't you used to look down on the five great demonic kings the most? Always saying they were brave but reckless."</p><p></p><p>Zhao Shenyuan let out a sinister smile, "Now that the Demon and Demon Realms have formed an alliance, has the Demon Realm contributed anything significant so far? It's better to arrive late than never. This is the perfect time for them to showcase their abilities, isn't it?"</p><p></p><p>Chu Qingcang suddenly understood, clapping his hands, "Shenyuan! Judging from your words, could it be that the Nightmare Demon Tribe has... been wiped out again?"</p><p></p><p>"Hehe, even if they've been wiped out, so be it. We have countless demon tribes in the Demon Realm; we don't care about such minor losses," Zhao Shenyuan continued indifferently, "Come, let's go see the five great demonic kings."</p><p></p><p>Chu Qingcang smiled mischievously, "Shenyuan, I understand your intentions now. Hehe, you're really sinister, aren't you?"</p><p></p><p>...</p><p></p><p>In the ominous and gloomy palace, there were five figures sitting cross-legged on each side. They all had an imposing aura.</p><p></p><p>At the moment, they were enjoying the food in front of them - raw meat, fresh blood, and tendons and bones. The only normal thing was the wine.</p><p></p><p>"Haha, Zhao Shenyuan, it took Chu Qingcang, the Demon King, to come and invite you. You're late, but it seems you're not too eager to see us," the bare-chested young man in the middle of the Demon Realm's five great demonic kings sneered at Zhao Shenyuan, who was also sitting in the middle.</p><p></p><p>"Hehe, how could that be? This king thought Teng the Snake Demon King had misunderstood. I was just preoccupied with some troubles in my heart, which is why I'm late. Alas," Zhao Shenyuan sighed melancholically at the end.</p><p></p><p>Huh? The mighty Demon King Shenyuan has troubles in his heart?</p><p></p><p>Except for Chu Qingcang, who was struggling to maintain his expression, the other five great demonic kings and three great demon kings all looked puzzled at Zhao Shenyuan.</p><p></p><p>Teng the Snake Demon King glanced at the other four demonic kings, his expression insincere as he said, "If you have any troubles, feel free to share them with us. Perhaps we can help you come up with a solution."</p><p></p><p>Subsequently, they saw Zhao Shenyuan pick up the wine cup on the table and take a big gulp, sighing, "Regarding this alliance between the Demon and Demon Realms to jointly explore the immortal tomb, I'm sure you all are aware. But you demonic kings may not know that my Demon Realm has previously sent the Black Tongue Demon Tribe and the Nightmare Demon Tribe to invade the Lishui Empire, only to be completely wiped out. I'm deeply saddened by this and feel ashamed before the Demon Sovereign."</p><p></p><p>The five great demonic kings exchanged glances and then burst into loud laughter.</p><p></p><p>"Haha, Zhao Shenyuan, you really have let down your Demon Sovereign. You couldn't even handle the small Lishui Empire!" Teng the Snake Demon King mocked with a sneer.</p><p></p><p>"Hehe, that's right. You demons are only good at plotting behind the scenes. In terms of combat power, you're far inferior to us demons. It's understandable that the demons you sent were completely wiped out, isn't that right, everyone? Haha!"</p><p></p><p>"Haha, that's right!"</p><p></p><p>"..."</p><p></p><p>The five great demonic kings continued to mock and jeer, full of arrogance.</p><p></p><p>This was something the demon kings could not tolerate. Except for the ever-somber Zhao Shenyuan, the other four demon kings abruptly stood up, glaring at them furiously.</p><p></p><p>"What did you say?! If you want to compare, we'll take you on!"</p><p></p><p>"That's right, what kind of nonsense is this? Do you think the Immortal Cultivation Realm is made of mud? In my opinion, you demons are just simple-minded and physically strong!"</p><p></p><p>"Exactly! Uh... no, that's not right... Ptui!"</p><p></p><p>Chu Qingcang was about to agree, but suddenly realized his own mistake, awkwardly scratching his head. Didn't that mean he was also simple-minded and physically strong?</p>

        <h1>Chapter 227</h1>
        <div class="content">
            <p>Here is the full English translation of the Chinese excerpt:</p><p></p><p>The next day. ‚ô¶üë∫‚ùªÔºô—ïùî•·ªÆ‰πÇ.ùìí‚ìÑ‚ìÇüíö‚ôñ</p><p></p><p>The appearance of the Longevity Medical Clinic had spread throughout the bustling market.</p><p></p><p>"Hey, Old Zhang, have you heard? There's actually a new medical clinic opened up in the southwest alley of our town."</p><p></p><p>"That's great, isn't it? Our Yanyu Town is quite remote, and no doctors were willing to come here before. Ordinary folks had to travel far to other towns when they got sick. Remember what happened a few years ago? Old Li's child got seriously ill with the cold, and didn't make it while being transported to another town."</p><p></p><p>"Yeah, it's really a pity about Old Li's child. But this doctor at the new clinic must have a kind heart to open a clinic in our remote Yanyu Town. I wonder how much money he can make here?"</p><p></p><p>"Indeed... Our Yanyu Town doesn't even have an administrator, it's more like a village than a town. Compared to others, the only difference is that we have a larger population, otherwise we're all just destitute, struggling people."</p><p></p><p>"Then shall we go and show our support later after they close up shop?"</p><p></p><p>"...Idiot, how can you call that 'showing support'? That's a place for saving lives!"</p><p></p><p>"Cough, slip of the tongue, slip of the tongue."</p><p></p><p>"I wonder how skilled the doctor's medical skills are?"</p><p></p><p>"Tch, the fact that he's willing to come to our place means he has a kind heart. As long as he can treat minor illnesses, that's good enough. We won't have to travel far to other towns anymore."</p><p></p><p>"That's right, and many serious illnesses often start from minor ones after all..."</p><p></p><p>...</p><p></p><p>At the Longevity Medical Clinic.</p><p></p><p>Dressed as a young medicine attendant, Tongxin had just hung up a banner at the entrance, which read: "Treating all illnesses of the common people, and the ailments of cultivators."</p><p></p><p>He looked at the words "ailments of cultivators" with some puzzlement.</p><p></p><p>Do cultivators also get sick?</p><p></p><p>Probably not, right?</p><p></p><p>Unless they've encountered some problem in their cultivation, or fallen into demonic cultivation?</p><p></p><p>Hmm, it must be that.</p><p></p><p>Tongxin straightened his hat, about to go inside, when his gaze suddenly sharpened - he sensed many auras heading towards the medical clinic.</p><p></p><p>Soon after, many of the common folk from Yanyu Town arrived, looking at the Longevity Medical Clinic with delight.</p><p></p><p>So it's true!</p><p></p><p>Their Yanyu Town really has a new medical clinic, called the Longevity Medical Clinic!</p><p></p><p>Especially the banner's words "Treating all illnesses of the common people, and the ailments of cultivators" made them even more pleasantly surprised and astonished.</p><p></p><p>Great, this medical clinic is so impressive, their medical skills must be excellent.</p><p></p><p>However, they also had some doubts - if the medical skills were truly as formidable as the banner claimed, why would they come to the remote Yanyu Town?</p><p></p><p>"Little doctor, is this your clinic? Wonderful, wonderful, our Yanyu Town finally has a medical clinic, we are so grateful!"</p><p></p><p>"Thank you, thank you, everyone let's thank the little doctor!"</p><p></p><p>"Thank you, little doctor!"</p><p></p><p>The crowd bowed slightly to show their respect.</p><p></p><p>Tongxin felt a bit embarrassed, quickly stepping back and waving his hands: "Everyone, you've misunderstood. I'm just the medicine attendant of the Longevity Medical Clinic."</p><p></p><p>As for medical skills, he didn't have any, but cultivators could refine detoxifying pills, which were quite effective. </p><p></p><p>However, those detoxifying pills also had drawbacks - the medicinal properties could cause permanent damage to ordinary people's bodies.</p><p></p><p>And cultivators basically didn't bother refining those, since they were meant for ordinary people, they didn't want to waste time on that.</p><p></p><p>Ah, so he's just the medicine attendant, no wonder his attire and youthful appearance didn't seem to indicate high medical skills.</p><p></p><p>Seeing the strange gazes, Tongxin scratched his head and chuckled awkwardly.</p><p></p><p>At this moment, Lu Changsheng walked out from the clinic entrance, coming to Tongxin's side, and cupped his hands towards the crowd, smiling gently: "Everyone, I am the doctor of this medical clinic. I've just arrived in Yanyu, please feel free to ask for my guidance in the future."</p><p></p><p>The crowd looked at this refined scholar in front of them with shining eyes.</p><p></p><p>Ah, that's it, that's the right feel.</p><p></p><p>This scholar-like gentleman must be a skilled doctor.</p><p></p><p>"Doctor, you are too humble. We are just ordinary folks trying to make a living, but..."</p><p></p><p>Here is the full English translation of the Chinese excerpt:</p><p></p><p>"Whether to give advice or not, it's up to you," he said.</p><p></p><p>[New 29 Book Bar]</p><p></p><p>"Yes, doctor, your coming to our Yanyu Town is a blessing for our Yanyu Town. In the future, if any of us falls ill, we will have to rely on you!" </p><p></p><p>"Doctor, I, Old Li, will tell you the truth. You may not know this, but our Yanyu Town is located in a remote area, and no doctor has been willing to come here before. Two years ago, my child unfortunately contracted a severe cold, and on the way to seek medical treatment in another town, he... he..." </p><p></p><p>At this point, a middle-aged man with white hair said with reddened eyes, his emotions somewhat agitated.</p><p></p><p>Everyone fell silent, all looking at the middle-aged man, wanting to comfort him but not knowing what to say.</p><p></p><p>They all knew this middle-aged man - he was Old Li, Li Dashan.</p><p></p><p>On the day Li Dashan's child passed away, he could be said to have turned white-haired overnight, even though he was only forty years old.</p><p></p><p>Tongxin looked at the middle-aged man with some pity in his eyes, his eyelids slightly reddened. This paternal love made him vaguely recall his own late father.</p><p></p><p>Unfortunately, his parents had passed away decades after he embarked on the immortal path.</p><p></p><p>At this moment, Lu Changsheng patted Tongxin's shoulder and softly said, "Go tidy up the vegetable patch in the courtyard."</p><p></p><p>Tongxin's gaze flickered, suppressing his emotions, and he replied with a bow, "Yes."</p><p></p><p>After Tongxin entered the courtyard,</p><p></p><p>Lu Changsheng looked at the silent crowd and said, "Don't worry, now that I'm here, such incidents will no longer occur."</p><p></p><p>The crowd was stunned, their hearts moved, and they all bowed in gratitude, "Thank you, doctor."</p><p></p><p>"Doctor, may I ask your surname?" someone asked expectantly.</p><p></p><p>It was essential to establish a good relationship with the doctor, so that in the future, if they fell ill, they could have a good conversation with the doctor.</p><p></p><p>Lu Changsheng smiled and said, "My surname is Lu."</p><p></p><p>...</p><p></p><p>Night fell.</p><p></p><p>In the Lu Changsheng Medical Clinic, the lamps were warm and bright.</p><p></p><p>Tongxin was sitting cross-legged, diligently cultivating.</p><p></p><p>His cultivation must not be surpassed by his junior brother, or else he, as the elder brother, would lose face.</p><p></p><p>He could hardly imagine how Lin Dong would mock him...</p><p></p><p>At the long table, Lu Changsheng took a sip of tea and suddenly said, "Tongxin, tomorrow, go to the street and find a medicinal apprentice for the clinic."</p><p></p><p>Tongxin heard this and quickly emerged from his cultivation state, respectfully replying, "Yes, sir."</p><p></p><p>Although he did not understand the master's intention in recruiting a medicinal apprentice, he did not dare to ask too many questions. He would simply carry out the master's instructions obediently.</p><p></p><p>Lu Changsheng nodded slightly at this, and then his gaze suddenly flickered as he said, "Tongxin, go open the courtyard gate."</p><p></p><p>Tongxin was startled, but soon he also sensed that someone was approaching the clinic.</p><p></p><p>He hurried to open the gate.</p><p></p><p>Moments later,</p><p></p><p>Tongxin led in a woman carrying a child and a pale-faced man, rushing them inside.</p><p></p><p>As soon as they saw Lu Changsheng, the two were about to kneel, but Lu Changsheng gestured for them to stand up.</p><p></p><p>The woman sobbed urgently, "Doctor Lu, my child has not been able to drink milk since last night. I thought he just had a poor appetite, but until now he still hasn't had any milk, and he's been sleeping the whole time. If it weren't for his heartbeat and breathing... we would have thought... wuwu."</p><p></p><p>"Doctor Lu, please, it's late at night and we really have no other choice. We can't make it to another town in time, and our child hasn't had any milk for a whole day and night. If you can cure our child, we're willing to give up everything we have!" The man was also deathly pale as he pleaded, not wanting to repeat the tragic fate of Old Li's family.</p><p></p><p>"It's alright, I'm here," Lu Changsheng comforted the two, then gently waved his hand.</p><p></p><p>The medicine cabinet behind the counter opened, and a purple-blue leaf-like medicinal herb flew out, landing in his hand.</p><p></p><p>Lu Changsheng placed the purple-blue leaf near the boy's nose, and the woman and the man were delighted to see the boy's nose twitch and his eyes open, his large eyes looking brightly at Lu Changsheng.</p>

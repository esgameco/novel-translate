        <h1>Chapter 425</h1>
        <div class="content">
            <p>Here is the full English translation of the Chinese excerpt:</p><p></p><p>At Cloud Zecang's command, the Prime Minister of Cloud Lan hurriedly issued the order.</p><p></p><p>Although the people were bewildered and perplexed in their hearts, they of course dared not defy the King's command, not even with a million wills.</p><p></p><p>Subsequently, under the hurried instructions of the guards, the crowd quickly dispersed.</p><p></p><p>In no time, the East Main Gate of the capital city became deserted, with only a few lonely guards respectfully standing there.</p><p></p><p>Seeing this, Cloud Zecang continued, "Relay the order to the Imperial Guards to patrol the four sides of the East Main Gate, and no one is allowed to approach."</p><p></p><p>"Yes, Your Majesty."</p><p></p><p>At the same time, the news of King Cloud Zecang suddenly arriving at the East Main Gate with the officials spread like an epidemic throughout the capital.</p><p></p><p>The various factions in the capital were shaken, and they all turned their curious gazes towards the direction of the East Main Gate.</p><p></p><p>No one knew why the King had suddenly appeared at the East Main Gate with the officials. </p><p></p><p>If it were not for the order that no one was allowed to approach the East Main Gate, many people of power would have rushed there to pay their respects.</p><p></p><p>...</p><p></p><p>"Hmm? Father the King has appeared at the East Main Gate with the officials?" </p><p></p><p>At the same moment, in the palace, a young man dressed in luxurious brocade robes had a flashing gaze.</p><p></p><p>"Yes, Your Highness, the news is true, and the entire capital now knows about it," the subordinate reported with a bow.</p><p></p><p>Cloud Aochong's brows furrowed, and his eyes narrowed slightly. "Do you know the purpose of Father the King's actions?"</p><p></p><p>"Returning to Your Highness, no, I do not know." The subordinate was embarrassed, trembling as he spoke.</p><p></p><p>How could he know the King's intentions? It was a sudden development, and he was just a subordinate. No wonder His Highness, the Crown Prince, was not favored, to ask such an absurd question of his subordinate...He was truly foolish.</p><p></p><p>His Highness had always been rather self-righteous, always feeling that the King's favor towards him was just more subtle and not as obvious.</p><p></p><p>"Have the Second Princes shown any reaction after receiving the news?" Cloud Aochong continued to ask.</p><p></p><p>"Returning to Your Highness, the Second Princes have not shown any reaction," the subordinate respectfully replied.</p><p></p><p>Cloud Aochong suddenly stood up and walked towards the exit with his hands behind his back.</p><p></p><p>"Come, follow this Prince to the East Main Gate."</p><p></p><p>Ah?</p><p></p><p>The subordinate paused, then mustered up the courage to step behind Cloud Aochong, cautiously saying, "Your Highness, the King has ordered that no one is allowed to approach the East Main Gate..."</p><p></p><p>He was panicked. Didn't His Highness see that the other Princes didn't dare go to the East Main Gate? How could His Highness just...</p><p></p><p>"Hmm?" Cloud Aochong's steps paused, and he tilted his head, speaking indifferently, "Are you teaching this Prince how to act?"</p><p></p><p>The subordinate trembled, stammering, "I-I would not dare, it's just that, Your Highness, the King has given the order..."</p><p></p><p>As Cloud Aochong's trusted subordinate, he was naturally doing it for Cloud Aochong's own good. </p><p></p><p>If Cloud Aochong really went to the East Main Gate, he would definitely get scolded!</p><p></p><p>Cloud Aochong was about to get angry, but it seemed he also realized the subordinate was acting for his own good, so he waved his hand impatiently:</p><p></p><p>"Alright, no need to say more, this Prince has his own plans."</p><p></p><p>In Cloud Aochong's view, the fact that Father the King had suddenly appeared at the East Main Gate with the officials meant that there must be something going on. </p><p></p><p>And by ordering that no one was allowed to approach, it seemed this matter was quite serious, even urgent.</p><p></p><p>As the Crown Prince, of course he had to help Father the King resolve the difficulties! </p><p></p><p>Even if he couldn't be of much help, when Father the King saw him there, he would surely feel comforted and pleased.</p><p></p><p>Thinking of this, Cloud Aochong imagined Cloud Zecang's approving and praising gaze towards him, and his heart grew increasingly fervent.</p><p></p><p>He had truly surpassed the other Princes by a wide margin.</p><p></p><p>The subordinate saw this and secretly sighed, having no choice but to follow reluctantly.</p><p></p><p>He couldn't help but feel that something was not quite right...</p><p></p><p>Here is the full English translation of the Chinese excerpt:</p><p></p><p>The Premonition of Xiang.</p><p></p><p>He always felt that the Crown Prince was going to get into trouble.</p><p></p><p>.........</p><p></p><p>In the sky far away from the capital city, the imperial carriage was speeding along.</p><p></p><p>"Little Ye, from the looks of you all, it seems we're almost to the capital, right?" </p><p></p><p>Outside the carriage, the old turtle glanced at the expressions of Ye Xunwang and the others, and asked.</p><p></p><p>"Yes, Senior Turtle, we'll arrive at the capital in less than a thousand li." Ye Xunwang hurriedly replied, for he certainly didn't dare to be negligent towards this terrifying old servant.</p><p></p><p>Ye Xunwang had personally experienced the terrifying nature of this old turtle senior.</p><p></p><p>Cloud Aoye and his four subordinates had the corners of their mouths twitching, tightly pursing their lips.</p><p></p><p>This form of address, "Little Ye", had truly shocked them.</p><p></p><p>Cloud Aoye had also never seen anyone call Uncle Ye "Little Ye" before, which sounded ridiculous, but... it was indeed quite ridiculous.</p><p></p><p>However, when Cloud Aoye thought about Ye Xunwang's previous description of the turtle senior, he no longer found it ridiculous.</p><p></p><p>The old turtle rolled his eyes, beckoned Ye Xunwang over with his hand, and whispered in his ear, "Are there many beauties in the capital? Surely better than the barren Tianxiang City, right?"</p><p></p><p>Ye Xunwang's gaze paused, and he turned his head to glance at the old turtle.</p><p></p><p>Deeply hidden, deeply hidden!</p><p></p><p>Who would have thought that such a powerful expert would be so lecherous?</p><p></p><p>Ye Xunwang was surprised, but also delighted.</p><p></p><p>How wonderful, how wonderful to be lecherous!</p><p></p><p>He might have found a shortcut to quickly establish a good relationship with the old servant in front of him!</p><p></p><p>However, in terms of beauties, he wasn't too familiar with that either, and he hadn't paid much attention to the beauties of the capital before, so he didn't know what to say for the moment.</p><p></p><p>Suddenly, Ye Xunwang glanced at the side of Cloud Aoye, and a flash of inspiration struck him!</p><p></p><p>Ah, this child Aoye is actually quite professional in this area, isn't he? </p><p></p><p>As the saying goes, "each has their own specialty", he must be able to give a perfect answer!</p><p></p><p>Who would have thought that this child Aoye would be useful in this critical moment.</p><p></p><p>So Ye Xunwang pulled Cloud Aoye over and whispered to the bewildered Cloud Aoye, "Aoye, the turtle senior asked if there are many beauties in the capital, what do you say?"</p><p></p><p>Cloud Aoye's gaze was still hazy, but at the mention of the word "beauties", his eyes immediately lit up, and he respectfully said, "Hehe, turtle senior, I'm familiar with this! The beauties in the entire Yunlan Ancient Kingdom are the most in the capital!"</p><p></p><p>As he spoke, Cloud Aoye proudly raised his thumb.</p><p></p><p>Seeing this, Ye Xunwang smiled contentedly.</p><p></p><p>Oh ho?</p><p></p><p>The old turtle immediately became excited, and he put his arm around Cloud Aoye's shoulder and walked off to the side, ready to chat more.</p><p></p><p>Cloud Aoye looked like he was honored and delighted.</p><p></p><p>A moment later, the old turtle came back with his arm around Cloud Aoye, smiling happily.</p><p></p><p>"Aoye, you're a good kid, you have the same temperament as Grandpa Turtle. When we arrive at the capital, Grandpa Turtle's clothing, food, 'accommodation' and travel will all be arranged by you, okay?"</p><p></p><p>Cloud Aoye chuckled and scratched his head, "Turtle senior, don't worry, I can't guarantee other aspects, but when it comes to clothing, food, 'accommodation' and travel, I'll make sure you're satisfied!!"</p><p></p><p>"Mm!" The old turtle nodded in satisfaction.</p><p></p><p>At this moment, the imperial carriage passed through the clouds, and a vast and prosperous city domain appeared before everyone's eyes!</p><p></p><p>Ye Xunwang looked down from above, and his sharp eyes spotted Cloud Zeze and the others at the East Gate, and he felt a slight relief in his heart.</p><p></p><p>He then turned to the imperial carriage and respectfully said, "My lord, we have arrived at the capital."</p><p></p><p>"Mm." The magnetic voice came from behind the curtain.</p><p></p><p>Ye Xunwang let out a breath, then waved his hand, and the imperial carriage plunged down towards the East Gate of the capital city below!</p><p></p><p>.........</p><p></p><p>For the fastest updates of flawless novels, please visit www.feixs.com</p><p></p><p>For mobile access: https://m.feixs.com/chapter-45751-38225544</p>

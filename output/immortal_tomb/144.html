        <h1>Chapter 144</h1>
        <div class="content">
            <p>Here is the full English translation of the Chinese excerpt:</p><p></p><p>The man in blue robes slowly walked towards them. üê®üçü‚ûÖ‚ùæ≈üùî•·ªÆ‚ìß.Ôº£ùìûùïûüê§üêº</p><p></p><p>In this moment, Hai Dong and Wu Che were both shocked and trembled, for when had they ever been this close to an Immortal Emperor? And this was the Immortal Emperor of Longevity!</p><p></p><p>It was... too sudden.</p><p></p><p>They were so frightened that they knelt on the ground and kowtowed, not daring to lift their heads even if they had a hundred times the courage.</p><p></p><p>Gu He Lin snapped out of his daze and hurriedly led the young disciples to kneel and bow in trepidation.</p><p></p><p>The hearts of the crowd were in disarray, filled with timidity, reverence, awe, and bewilderment.</p><p></p><p>They hastily paid their respects, </p><p></p><p>"Greetings, Your Eminence the Immortal Emperor!"</p><p></p><p>Lu Chang Sheng halted before them and lightly chuckled, "How you addressed me before, you may continue to do so. There's no need to be so fearful, that would be quite dull."</p><p></p><p>"Rise."</p><p></p><p>With that, Lu Chang Sheng's figure flickered and he reappeared seated calmly at the stone table.</p><p></p><p>Hai Dong and Wu Che remained kneeling, their heads bowed low, while the young disciples also knelt as if they had been paralyzed.</p><p></p><p>Gu He Lin took a deep breath, summoned his courage, and went to the stone table, respectfully greeting "Master" before picking up the wine pitcher to pour a cup for Lu Chang Sheng.</p><p></p><p>The sound of the wine pouring into the cup echoed through the courtyard, then quickly faded.</p><p></p><p>Lu Chang Sheng gently picked up the wine cup, then glanced at Gu He Lin and the young disciples.</p><p></p><p>Gu He Lin immediately understood, and urgently called out to them, "Young disciples, did you not hear the Master telling you to rise?"</p><p></p><p>"Ah, yes..." </p><p></p><p>The young ones trembled and slowly stood up, coming to the side and lowering their heads, extremely restrained.</p><p></p><p>Hai Dong and Wu Che were panicked, wanting to leave but not daring to speak. </p><p></p><p>They knew that as mere disciples of a minor sect, they had no right to converse with the Immortal Emperor of Longevity, this supreme celestial being.</p><p></p><p>They knew that not even Transcendent Immortals, Immortal Lords, Immortal Kings, or the other Immortal Emperors would dare to breathe heavily in the presence of the Immortal Emperor of Longevity.</p><p></p><p>At this time, Lu Chang Sheng glanced at Gu He Lin, then swept his gaze over Hai Dong and Wu Che.</p><p></p><p>Gu He Lin understood again, and quickly said, "Senior Brothers Hai and Wu, you may go attend to your duties."</p><p></p><p>Instantly, Hai Dong and Wu Che felt as if they had been granted amnesty. They bowed to Lu Chang Sheng, then bent their bodies and slowly retreated out of the courtyard.</p><p></p><p>Once outside the courtyard, they looked at each other in shock, panting heavily!</p><p></p><p>The Immortal Emperor of Longevity had come to their tiny Bai Yue Sect!</p><p></p><p>And it was clearly for the sake of Gu He Lin and the others!</p><p></p><p>They felt as if they were dreaming.</p><p></p><p>After all, barring any accidents, a figure as grand as the Immortal Emperor of Longevity would never have any interactions with the likes of them.</p><p></p><p>Without exaggeration, they were merely ants in the Immortal Realm, and before the Immortal Emperor of Longevity, they were ants among ants!</p><p></p><p>How did Gu He Lin and the others manage to have a connection with the Immortal Emperor of Longevity?</p><p></p><p>Looking at it this way, Gu He Lin and the others were truly underappreciated in this minor sect - with such a relationship, they would be greatly revered even in the Nine Star Sects!</p><p></p><p>"Hai Dong, should we inform the Sect Master of the Immortal Emperor's arrival?" Wu Che stammered.</p><p></p><p>"Of course we should!" </p><p></p><p>Hai Dong said anxiously, "The Immortal Emperor's arrival is a momentous event. Even if we hadn't seen it, it would be fine. But since we have witnessed it, this earth-shattering matter must be reported to the Sect Master. We must show the utmost courtesy, otherwise, how will the Immortal Emperor view us? If we make any mistakes, even a million Bai Yue Sects would be unable to make amends."</p><p></p><p>Wu Che solemnly nodded. That's right, it's like a gift - you can give it, but whether the other party accepts it is another matter. The attitude must be appropriate!</p><p></p><p>"Let's go quickly!!"</p><p></p><p>...</p><p></p><p>The courtyard was silent.</p><p></p><p>Lu Chang Sheng took a sip of wine and smiled, "Come, sit."</p><p></p><p>The young disciples trembled and respectfully responded, "Yes, Master."</p><p></p><p>Subsequently, the three of them cautiously sat down at the stone table, as instructed by Gu He Lin, though they did not dare to sit without permission. But since Lu Chang Sheng had commanded it, they had no choice but to obey.</p><p></p><p>Here is the full English translation of the Chinese excerpt:</p><p></p><p>The four people kept their heads down, not daring to drink or speak.</p><p></p><p>Although the teacher was still the same teacher, his identity had changed. His current identity... was too terrifying for them.</p><p></p><p>"Raise your heads and drink," Lu Changsheng said lightly with a smile. "I am about to relinquish the position of Immortal Emperor, so there's no need to be so restrained. I am still myself."</p><p></p><p>Gu Helin and the others were stunned and couldn't help but raise their heads, their faces filled with confusion.</p><p></p><p>They really wanted to ask, "Why?"</p><p></p><p>"There are only five Immortal Emperors that can exist in the Five Great Immortal Realms. The other four Immortal Emperors ascended to a higher realm over 1,400 years ago, and the other four realms now have new emperors. As for the Central Immortal Realm, I should make way for the next generation," Lu Changsheng said lightly with a smile.</p><p></p><p>To him, the position of Immortal Emperor was just a nominal role he had taken on to pass the time in the long years.</p><p></p><p>Whenever he wanted, he could become the patriarch of a sect, the director of a hall, the dean of an academy, or go to the mortal realm and become a prison guard, an inn keeper, the leader of a mountain stronghold, a wandering knight-errant, or even a ferryman or a farmer. </p><p></p><p>He even felt that if he wanted, he could easily replace the Celestial Emperor of the Ancestral Heavenly Realm, no matter how powerful that being might be. After all, he had an eternity of time and could always find something to occupy himself.</p><p></p><p>Merely sleeping all the time wouldn't do.</p><p></p><p>The group was stunned, looking at him with reverence and reluctance.</p><p></p><p>Gu Helin carefully asked, "Teacher, are you going to ascend?"</p><p></p><p>Lu Changsheng shook his head slightly. "For me, there is no such thing as 'ascension'."</p><p></p><p>The group was silent.</p><p></p><p>Seeing that Lu Changsheng was still as gentle as before, Tong Xin and the others couldn't help but relax a bit.</p><p></p><p>Tong Xin looked at Lu Changsheng with admiration and said, "Teacher, you... are so amazing."</p><p></p><p>Lu Changsheng's lips curved up in a faint, mysterious smile. "It's just so-so."</p><p></p><p>He then asked, "Now, do you know how powerful I am in the Immortal Realm?"</p><p></p><p>Tong Xin's body trembled, his face paling. He hurriedly stood up to kneel, but Lu Changsheng smiled and gently pushed him back down with his mind.</p><p></p><p>"Thank you, Teacher, for not blaming Tong Xin," Tong Xin said tremblingly, then lowered his head and didn't dare speak further.</p><p></p><p>To Tong Xin, Lu Changsheng's aura as an Immortal Emperor was still as overwhelming as the heavens pressing down on him.</p><p></p><p>Lu Changsheng looked at Chen Dadao and said, "You've cultivated."</p><p></p><p>The previously silent Chen Dadao hurriedly stood up and bowed deeply. "It's thanks to the Teacher's grace."</p><p></p><p>Lu Changsheng nodded slightly, then said meaningfully, "Your steward is now a chief soul messenger in the Soul Realm. He's living quite comfortably. He even asked me why he hasn't seen your soul."</p><p></p><p>Upon hearing about his steward, Chen Dadao first felt joy, but then his face stiffened. So he had been hoping for Chen Dadao's death.</p><p></p><p>Chen Dadao pursed his lips, wanting to ask more about the steward, but didn't dare.</p><p>However, knowing that the steward he was close to was doing well put his heart at ease.</p><p></p><p>Lu Changsheng then looked at Lin Dong, causing Lin Dong to grow nervous. But as soon as Lu Changsheng's gaze left him, Lin Dong felt a deep sense of loss.</p><p></p><p>If he had to say who his greatest benefactor was, it wouldn't be Gu Helin, but Lu Changsheng. Lu Changsheng had always been the person Lin Dong respected and admired the most. Although he looked like an ordinary big brother, to Lin Dong, he was like a father, or even more than a father.</p><p></p><p>The next moment, Lin Dong steeled his resolve, gathered his courage, and stood up, bowing deeply. "Teacher, Lin Dong is grateful for your great kindness that year. Without you, Lin Dong would not have had the chance to enter the immortal path, let alone ascend to the Immortal Realm. Lin Dong..."</p><p></p><p>As he spoke, Lin Dong's eyes reddened, and he knelt on the ground, kowtowing three times forcefully, his forehead bloodied.</p><p></p><p>Lu Changsheng lifted him up with his mind, not saying any polite words or words of sentiment, but simply saying, "Since you have passed through that darkness, you should go to an even better place, see brighter light, and become even stronger."</p>

        <h1>Chapter 213</h1>
        <div class="content">
            <p>Here is the full English translation of the Chinese excerpt:</p><p></p><p>The smile on Leiyu's face receded a bit. He silently filled the five wine cups and sat back down.</p><p></p><p>Leiying and the other two knitted their brows, their gazes blank.</p><p></p><p>Leiyu rubbed the wine cup with his fingers, looking at the crystal-clear liquid inside. After a moment, he raised his head. "Fellow Daoist, does your intention mean you are about to leave the human realm?"</p><p></p><p>Lu Changsheng turned his head to look out the window and replied faintly, "Both yes and no."</p><p></p><p>This ambiguous response left Leiyu and the others completely puzzled.</p><p></p><p>Leiyu couldn't understand it, and he sighed regretfully, "Fellow Daoist, whenever you decide to leave the human realm, please be sure to tell me. I'll come and see you off..."</p><p></p><p>Towards the end, a gleam suddenly appeared in his eyes as he continued to ask, "By the way, may I know your honored name?"</p><p></p><p>Lu Changsheng did not answer, but instead chuckled lightly, "You all go ahead and drink. After you're done, I'll go upstairs to rest."</p><p></p><p>Seeing this, Leiyu felt helpless. He glanced at Leiying and the other two, and the three of them instantly understood, picking up their wine cups along with Leiyu.</p><p></p><p>They looked at the liquid in the cups, their throats moving slightly, barely able to contain their eagerness.</p><p></p><p>"Fellow Daoist, we toast to you, thank you for your gift!"</p><p></p><p>Leiyu raised his cup, along with Leiying and the other two, towards Lu Changsheng.</p><p></p><p>Lu Changsheng smiled and slightly raised his cup in response.</p><p></p><p>Seeing this, Leiyu and the others were delighted. Their mouths already watering, they immediately tilted their heads back and drained the cups in one gulp!</p><p></p><p>Boom!!</p><p></p><p>The familiar flavor exploded in their nasal and oral cavities, the silky wine liquid flowing down their throats, cleansing their souls.</p><p></p><p>...</p><p></p><p>A moment later, Leiyu and the others still had their eyes closed, their faces showing a look of pure bliss, immersed in the soul-cleansing experience.</p><p></p><p>This was truly... refreshing!</p><p></p><p>Leiyu and the others were unaware that the customers in the restaurant had all been left in shock.</p><p></p><p>Everyone was staring fixatedly at the "soul-cleansing" brew on their table, at the wine cups in their hands!</p><p></p><p>What kind of exquisite wine was this?!</p><p></p><p>It was so fragrant and mellow!</p><p></p><p>Even the proprietor was eagerly smacking his lips, just from the aroma, knowing that the wine in his own restaurant couldn't compare to this mysterious brew at all.</p><p></p><p>"This wine is truly the best in the world!" Leiyu exclaimed, then opened his eyes to look at Lu Changsheng and sighed, "Fellow Daoist, this wine... I'm afraid I'll never be able to forget it for the rest of my life, yet you are about to leave the human realm. What a pity."</p><p></p><p>Leiying and the other two opened their eyes as well, taking a deep breath. This wine... was sublime!</p><p></p><p>Lu Changsheng shook his head with a smile.</p><p></p><p>Leiyu's eyes darted around, then he smiled expectantly, "Fellow Daoist, if you don't wish to reveal your name, that's fine. But can you at least tell us the name of this wine?"</p><p></p><p>"Soul-Cleansing," Lu Changsheng said as he stood up and walked around the counter, heading upstairs.</p><p></p><p>Soul-Cleansing... how fitting.</p><p></p><p>Leiyu nodded in admiration, but when he came to his senses, he found that Lu Changsheng had already reached the top of the stairs. He quickly stood up and smiled, "Fellow Daoist, the day after tomorrow is the battle between my Great Day Thunder Sect and the Carefree Sect. Will you come and watch?"</p><p></p><p>"I will," Lu Changsheng replied, his footsteps not slowing, and his figure soon disappeared at the top of the stairs.</p><p></p><p>Leiyu's eyes lit up, and he immediately filled a pot with the remaining Soul-Cleansing brew, handing it to Leiying. "There's still quite a bit left, you two Protectors can share it."</p><p></p><p>Hearing this, Zhao the Protector and Lin the Protector were overjoyed, taking the Soul-Cleansing brew and quickly following after them.</p><p></p><p>As soon as they left, the restaurant erupted in an uproar.</p><p></p><p>"Heavens, what kind of exquisite wine was that? Just from the aroma, I feel I can't control myself..."</p><p></p><p>Here is the full English translation of the Chinese excerpt:</p><p></p><p>"Pulled out!" </p><p></p><p>"Ah... I really want to drink, but that Taoist priest is so polite even to the Young Patriarch of the Thunder Sect, he must be someone important. Otherwise, I really want to snatch it away..."</p><p></p><p>"Ah, let's go, let's go. After smelling that wine aroma, the wine from the Immortal Wine Pavilion suddenly tastes bland."</p><p></p><p>"..."</p><p></p><p>Watching the customers one by one pay and leave, the innkeeper's face fell, about to cry.</p><p></p><p>.........</p><p></p><p>The time has come to the last day.</p><p></p><p>More and more cultivators rushed to the Thunder Realm, rushing to the various cities outside the Great Day Thunder Sect, their numbers reaching an unprecedented level.</p><p></p><p>Today, the atmosphere in the Shocking Thunder City is noticeably different, becoming slightly scorching and solemn, and the cultivators' words are fewer than the previous two days, obviously not as noisy.</p><p></p><p>After all... Tomorrow is the battle to surpass their level!</p><p></p><p>Until now, no one has ever heard of or seen anyone from the Carefree Sect. Many cultivators suspect that the Carefree Sect may not even show up, just grabbing attention and then running away, which is not impossible.</p><p></p><p>Inside the Great Day Thunder Sect,</p><p></p><p>Everything is still proceeding in an orderly manner, the disciples seem unaffected by the upcoming battle to surpass their level, each with a relaxed and disdainful demeanor.</p><p></p><p>It's the elders who have been informed by Elder Cheng Dong that the Carefree Sect is somewhat extraordinary, so they don't underestimate them too much.</p><p></p><p>Of course, they also won't pay too much attention to them, as this is related to the lofty and superior status of the Great Day Thunder Sect.</p><p></p><p>In this human realm, the Great Day Thunder Sect is the supreme and the strongest, this has been deeply ingrained in their bones.</p><p></p><p>Not to mention the obscure Carefree Sect,</p><p></p><p>Even the Mysterious Fire Sect and the Heavenly Sword Pavilion, those two first-rate sects, they are not afraid of, at most just solemn.</p><p></p><p>In a luxurious building in the Shocking Thunder City.</p><p></p><p>From the outside, it looks ordinary, but inside, under the enhancement of spatial talismans, it is vastly spacious.</p><p></p><p>At this moment, within the building.</p><p></p><p>The five elders of the Carefree Sect stand in the front, below them are the two Holy Sons, Tong Xin and Lin Dong, along with the executive protectors and numerous disciples.</p><p></p><p>More than ten thousand figures in this building do not feel crowded at all.</p><p></p><p>"Tomorrow, it is the battle to surpass our level," </p><p></p><p>Peng Fang, with his hands behind his back and a big belly, said calmly, his words echoing through the space.</p><p></p><p>The crowd shuddered, their expressions solemn, listening attentively.</p><p></p><p>Seeing the people's attitudes, Peng Fang was satisfied in his heart. His mind flashed the image of the Taoist priest in blue, and his eyes flickered as he continued, "This battle to surpass our level, facing the number one sect in the human realm, the Great Day Thunder Sect, succeeding will not be easy, it may even be... Brutal."</p><p></p><p>The crowd fell silent.</p><p></p><p>They all know in their hearts that the Carefree Sect is newly established, its foundation is far inferior to the Great Day Thunder Sect.</p><p></p><p>"However, there is one thing, and it is the most important, the Great Day Thunder Sect is not as ruthless as our Carefree Sect," Peng Fang suddenly continued, "I, the Elder, say this here today, in tomorrow's battle to surpass our level, some of you, from the elders and executive protectors to the lowly disciples, some of you will die!"</p><p></p><p>The crowd's eyes sharpened, they had already mentally prepared.</p><p></p><p>Enjoying the supreme treatment of the sect, receiving the precious colored spirit stones, under such abundant resources, their cultivation has soared. They must pay something for the sect!</p><p></p><p>Most importantly, this battle is also for themselves, for a stronger self!!</p><p></p><p>Peng Fang shouted, "Are you afraid?!"</p><p></p><p>A moment of silence in the space, soon, a unified shout resounded,</p><p></p><p>"Not afraid!!!"</p>

        <h1>Chapter 183</h1>
        <div class="content">
            <p>Here is the full English translation of the Chinese excerpt:</p><p></p><p>The Ancestor Beast had already transformed into a strong old man. </p><p></p><p>That's right, he was indeed strong.</p><p></p><p>Although the Ancestor Beast did not have much lifespan left, he was not as lifeless and gloomy as Jiang Wumang, Zhan Shanghai, and Chen Jiang.</p><p></p><p>His strength was far superior to theirs, and since his true form was a demonic beast, he was naturally very different from these cultivators.</p><p></p><p>"Who did you say?" </p><p></p><p>At this moment, the Ancestor Beast's eyes widened, as if he had misheard.</p><p></p><p>"Lu Changsheng!" Zhan Shanghai sighed, his wrinkled face full of worry.</p><p></p><p>"He... he has broken the seal?" the Ancestor Beast exclaimed in shock.</p><p></p><p>"Ah yes, those mysterious powerful experts from a hundred million years ago were really unreliable. We have been terribly wronged. You don't know, Lu Changsheng has opened an inn in the Black Sha Domain, probably just to come and kill us. Recently, the Jiang Clan Imperial House has already been destroyed by him. After I received the news, the imperial clan's foundation was gone, so I hurriedly brought the entire clan here to you..." Zhan Shanghai said solemnly.</p><p></p><p>Hearing the conversation between the two, Zhan Xingmang and the members of the Zhan Clan Imperial House couldn't help but feel a sense of despair.</p><p></p><p>The Jiang Clan Imperial House had actually been destroyed just like that, and even after so long, they still couldn't quite come to terms with it.</p><p></p><p>Moreover, it was very likely that the Zhan Clan Imperial House would be next.</p><p></p><p>The Ancestor Beast's face was extremely grave. He swept his gaze over the many disciples of the Zhan Clan Imperial House, then stared at Zhan Shanghai and coldly asked, "So what is your intention?"</p><p></p><p>Zhan Shanghai's eyes flickered as he solemnly said, "You know very well how terrifying Lu Changsheng is. Even those mysterious powerful experts found it difficult to break through his defenses."</p><p></p><p>"The only way is for us to join forces... to have the slightest chance of survival."</p><p></p><p>In fact, he was not afraid of dying, as his lifespan was already running out. It was just that... he felt very guilty.</p><p></p><p>He did not want to implicate so many of the Zhan Clan Imperial House disciples, and he did not want to follow in the footsteps of the Jiang Clan Imperial House!</p><p></p><p>"The slightest chance of survival... haha." The Ancestor Beast heard this and couldn't help but sneer.</p><p></p><p>He really wanted to tell Zhan Shanghai... you are overestimating yourselves.</p><p></p><p>With just the two of them against Lu Changsheng, there was not a chance in hell. Even if they were lucky enough to survive, it would be a miracle.</p><p></p><p>He was afraid that in the end, they would be beaten by Lu Changsheng until their souls were scattered, not even able to reincarnate.</p><p></p><p>After all, when you get involved in such matters, you will eventually have to pay the price.</p><p></p><p>He then said in a calm voice, "Zhan Shanghai, go back where you came from. I will not join forces with you."</p><p></p><p>"You... !" Zhan Shanghai's expression changed slightly, not expecting the Ancestor Beast to actually refuse.</p><p></p><p>He had not informed the Ancestor Beast of the news in advance, but had quietly brought his clan here, afraid that the Ancestor Beast would run away if he heard the news... and it turned out to be true.</p><p></p><p>Even Zhan Xingmang and the other members of the Zhan Clan Imperial House had grim expressions. If it was like this, wouldn't they be doomed?</p><p></p><p>"Why? In such a desperate situation, why don't we join forces and give it a try? Are you just waiting to die? After all these years of cultivation, what have you cultivated? You don't even have the courage!" Zhan Shanghai stared at him and said resentfully.</p><p></p><p>Upon hearing this, the Ancestor Beast's gaze turned cold. "Your current state is not as good as mine. You'd better watch your words carefully, otherwise, you don't even need Lu Changsheng to come, I will wipe out your Zhan Clan Imperial House completely!"</p><p></p><p>"...I understand, then I'll leave it to you," Zhan Shanghai said, closing his eyes.</p><p></p><p>"Hurry up and take your clan and leave. I still have matters to attend to, so I won't entertain you any further," the Ancestor Beast said helplessly, cupping his hands.</p><p></p><p>"Are you planning to escape to outside the Heavenly Scar?" Zhan Shanghai suddenly opened his eyes and asked the Ancestor Beast.</p><p></p><p>The Ancestor Beast's body paused, and he nodded slightly while facing away from him, saying, "Of course I want to escape. Even if we joined forces, we would have no chance at all. In fact... you know that in your heart."</p><p></p><p>Here is the full English translation of the Chinese excerpt:</p><p></p><p>"Dù míng."</p><p></p><p>Upon hearing this, Zhàn Shānhǎi fell silent for a moment, then suddenly bent down deeply and shouted, "Ancestral Beast, if you can lead my Zhàn clan out of the Heavenly Scar, then I beg you!"</p><p></p><p>"Old Ancestor!"</p><p></p><p>Zhàn Xīngmáng and the others were stunned and confused.</p><p></p><p>The Ancestral Beast was taken aback, turned around, and sighed as he helped Zhàn Shānhǎi up. "You don't have to be like this. It's just that... we were blinded by greed hundreds of thousands of years ago."</p><p></p><p>Zhàn Shānhǎi's expression was full of regret. "But... they don't deserve to die!"</p><p></p><p>"Hehe." The Ancestral Beast suddenly laughed. "Zhàn Shānhǎi, I'd say we're old friends. I just realized that you're so naive. I think you're a bit muddled."</p><p></p><p>"If I were Lù Chángshēng, being suppressed in the tomb for hundreds of thousands of years without seeing the light of day, when I came out, I wouldn't just destroy your entire clan, I would also drag out and whip all the ancestral remains of your past generations!"</p><p></p><p>"I don't blame Lù Chángshēng. If there's anyone to blame, it's those mysterious experts, and the greedy choices we made back then."</p><p></p><p>The Ancestral Beast finished speaking, then suddenly turned and left without further delay.</p><p></p><p>But just then, a figure in blue robes appeared like a ghost, standing in front of the Ancestral Beast, blocking his path...</p><p></p><p>"Where are you going?"</p><p></p><p>Lù Chángshēng looked at the stiff-faced Ancestral Beast and smiled as if greeting an old friend.</p><p></p><p>Lù Chángshēng!</p><p></p><p>Zhàn Shānhǎi's gaze was stunned. He didn't expect Lù Chángshēng to catch up so quickly. It had only been a short while.</p><p></p><p>Then his aura burst forth, as if facing a formidable enemy!</p><p></p><p>The members of the Zhàn Imperial Clan also sensed something and secretly activated their immortal qi, their eyes fixed intently on the legendary young man before them - the one who had destroyed the Jiāng Imperial Clan.</p><p></p><p>The Ancestral Beast's expression went from stiff to relaxed, then from relaxed to melancholic, and finally to resigned.</p><p></p><p>He clasped his hands and replied with a faint smile, "Senior Lù, you've arrived."</p><p></p><p>Lù Chángshēng looked at him and asked softly, "Do you know who those people were?"</p><p></p><p>The Ancestral Beast bitterly smiled and shook his head. "I don't know. Aside from those mysterious experts and the other powerful ones who were summoned from different worlds, I don't know... Even though the Heavenly Dao protected us at the time, some of our memories were still erased."</p><p></p><p>Hearing this, Lù Chángshēng's eyes flickered. His own memories had also disappeared, and although he could restore them by defying the heavens, the process was slow, and he could only recover them bit by bit over time.</p><p></p><p>But he was never in a hurry.</p><p></p><p>The Ancestral Beast suddenly said, "However, Senior Lù, although I don't know the identities of those mysterious experts, I do know that many of them, like us, were also summoned. They are on the other side of the Heavenly Scar, beyond this extremely dense forest. As for their specific information, I don't know."</p><p></p><p>Lù Chángshēng's eyes brightened, and he smiled. "That's quite considerate of you. You may pass on. I'll give you a chance at reincarnation, but when you get there, I'll have Hùn Guǐ properly welcome you. Since you've provoked me, there are some crimes you must still pay for..."</p><p></p><p>The Ancestral Beast didn't understand what Lù Chángshēng meant, but hearing that he could still reincarnate, he was delighted.</p><p></p><p>Reincarnation meant losing everything, including memories, but at least the soul would remain. At least it was better than having the soul dissipate and disappear completely - that would be a true and utter annihilation, which was truly terrifying to contemplate.</p><p></p><p>Lù Chángshēng suddenly turned his head to look at the ever-ready-to-fight Zhàn Shānhǎi and said indifferently, "Actually, if you hadn't tried to escape and instead come to my tavern sincerely to apologize, I might have forgiven you to some extent... But since you've run away and want to continue opposing me by allying with the Ancestral Beast, I'm afraid..."</p><p></p><p>"You, including all the members of your clan behind you, will not be able to enter the cycle of reincarnation."</p>

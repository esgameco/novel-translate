        <h1>Chapter 106</h1>
        <div class="content">
            <p>Here is the full English translation of the Chinese excerpt:</p><p></p><p>"Hmph, you're disturbing my mood. ‚ô§üêç‚ùªÔºô≈û‚Ñç‡∏¢◊ê.‚ìíÔºØùìúüòæ‚ô¨"</p><p></p><p>The old turtle grumbled and returned to the Chu clan's immortal tribe.</p><p></p><p>Chu Lang and the other two were petrified on the spot.</p><p></p><p>"Chu Lang, what kind of power does a silver-badge inspector usually have?" Huang Zhong asked with a pale face.</p><p></p><p>"The silver-badge inspectors are usually at the Great Luo realm, from the first rank to the fifth rank..." Chu Lang replied with a tight-lipped expression.</p><p></p><p>"Then what kind of power would it take to instantly kill a silver-badge inspector?" Chen He frowned.</p><p></p><p>"The cultivation level would need to be at least two to three ranks higher... I'm not too sure of the specifics, I'm only a fourth-rank golden immortal, don't ask me!" Chu Lang chuckled bitterly.</p><p></p><p>"The old servant of Senior Qingyi is so monstrous, then how powerful must Senior Qingyi be?"</p><p></p><p>Halfway through, Huang Zhong recalled Chu Lang's earlier disheveled state in the luxurious manor, and couldn't help but ask, "Chu Lang, do you know anything about Senior Qingyi's cultivation level?"</p><p></p><p>Chu Lang took a deep breath, opened his mouth to say something to Huang Zhong and Chen He, then left.</p><p></p><p>The gesture he made, Huang Zhong and Chen He understood it, and their scalps tingled as they looked at each other in shock!</p><p></p><p>"Chaos Origin?!"</p><p></p><p>In their remote domain, there was actually a venerable immortal lord!</p><p></p><p>...</p><p></p><p>Three days later.</p><p></p><p>At the entrance of the Chu clan's immortal tribe.</p><p></p><p>"Senior, you... you..." </p><p></p><p>Chu Lang, Huang Zhong, and Chen He knelt on the ground, their faces pale.</p><p></p><p>"Mm, I'm leaving now," L√º Changsheng stood on the turtle shell, smiling faintly.</p><p></p><p>The three of them had a conflicted expression, wanting to say something but hesitating.</p><p></p><p>L√º Changsheng naturally knew what they wanted to say, so he said, "Don't worry, the Inspection Hall has a brain. After this, they won't come to this Langtiandomain so quickly."</p><p></p><p>L√º Changsheng continued, "And you don't need to worry about the Inspection Hall seeking revenge in the future, because before that, I will deal with them."</p><p></p><p>Hearing those calm and collected words, Chu Lang, Huang Zhong, and Chen He didn't know what to say.</p><p></p><p>Stating the most ruthless things in the most nonchalant manner, "dealing with the Inspection Hall"... to be honest, it was a bit chilling to hear.</p><p></p><p>The Inspection Hall covered the entire Fuyang Immortal Realm, with an overwhelming power. How could it be so easily dealt with?</p><p></p><p>They even heard that the Grand Master of the Inspection Hall was a being at the Immortal King realm.</p><p></p><p>That was already in the league of the super powerhouses of the Four Directions Immortal World.</p><p></p><p>Chu Lang, Huang Zhong, and Chen He didn't know what to say. Facing an immortal lord, they didn't dare to say too much, and immediately knelt down, extremely respectfully saying, "Then we wish the Immortal Lord a safe journey."</p><p></p><p>"Immortal Lord?" L√º Changsheng smiled in surprise, then said, "Okay."</p><p></p><p>He then lightly stomped his foot, waking up the sleeping old turtle.</p><p></p><p>The next moment, the turtle's head and limbs emerged from the shell, the old turtle chuckled embarrassedly, saying he was exhausted from last night, then carried L√º Changsheng and floated up into the sky, disappearing.</p><p></p><p>After L√º Changsheng left, Chu Lang, Huang Zhong, and Chen He shakily stood up, their faces full of worry.</p><p></p><p>They felt that Senior Qingyi had abandoned them, and their three immortal tribes were still facing a life-and-death crisis.</p><p></p><p>"Father, has the senior left?" Chu Xiru√≤ came out and asked, patting her chest in relief, as she had been hiding far away.</p><p></p><p>"Yes, he's gone. Our three immortal tribes, I'm afraid it's over," Chu Lang said, turning to look at Huang Zhong and Chen He, gravely saying, "You two should quickly go back and consolidate your tribes. We three tribes can only flee from the Langtiandomain, we can't just wait for death."</p><p></p><p>"Mm, alas," Huang Zhong and Chen He sighed in agreement, as that was also what they were thinking.</p><p></p><p>Seeing the three of them sighing dejectedly, Chu Xiru√≤'s eyes flashed as she asked, "Father, did the senior say anything before he left?"</p><p></p><p>Chu Lang looked at her and gave a bitter smile. "Yes, the senior said we don't need to worry about the Inspection Hall, that he will deal with them... Alas."</p><p></p><p>Huang Zhong and Chen He also smiled bitterly, this was really hard to believe.</p><p></p><p>That senior was indeed the Chaos Origin Immortal Lord, but the Inspection Hall...</p><p></p><p>Here is the full English translation of the Chinese excerpt:</p><p></p><p>"Since the senior has said so, then Father and the two clan elders can rest assured." </p><p></p><p>Chu Xiruo said soothingly with a smile.</p><p></p><p>Huh?</p><p></p><p>The three looked at each other, not knowing why Chu Xiruo was so confident.</p><p></p><p>Chu Xiruo pursed her lips and said, "Father, two clan elders, Langtian Domain has been the place where our three families have survived for many years. How can we just leave? Even if we leave, with the eyes and coverage of the Patrol Hall, finding us would be too easy. So please trust the senior. Since the senior has said it, he will surely do it."</p><p></p><p>Chu Lang shook his head: "Xiruo, you are still too naive. We cannot place all our hopes on others, no matter what time it is, we must always have a backup plan. This is the way of survival."</p><p></p><p>Huang Zhong and Chen He also nodded in agreement.</p><p></p><p>Afterwards, the few of them exchanged greetings and hurriedly went back to make arrangements!</p><p></p><p>Seeing this, Chu Xiruo was also helpless. She knew that she was so confident because she knew Lu Changsheng's true identity. If she were to change places, she would probably have the same thoughts as her father and the others... In the end, she murmured in admiration:</p><p></p><p>"The Immortal Emperor Changsheng... As long as he is willing, I bet he can even overturn the Fuyao Immortal Realm. How could he not be able to deal with the Patrol Hall of the Fuyao Immortal Realm."</p><p></p><p>"I believe that when the news comes, Father and the others will scurry back to Langtian Domain."</p><p></p><p>...</p><p></p><p>In the void.</p><p></p><p>A figure was riding a turtle, with a trail of dark green light behind it.</p><p></p><p>Lu Changsheng stood on the turtle shell, his clothes fluttering. He looked down below and said softly, "The four immortal realms seem peaceful on the surface, but are actually on the verge of collapse."</p><p></p><p>The old turtle paused, slowing down its speed, and respectfully said, "Master, do you still remember that I told you in the Lingchen Realm that the immortal emperors of the four realms were not doing well?"</p><p></p><p>Lu Changsheng sat down cross-legged and nodded slightly.</p><p></p><p>"Master, you must be curious, right? How come those fellows are the supreme immortal emperors of the four realms, yet they are still not doing well? " The old turtle said in a solemn tone.</p><p></p><p>Lu Changsheng sat upright, expressionless, not showing any curiosity.</p><p></p><p>"Ahem." </p><p></p><p>Seeing Lu Changsheng like this, the old turtle cleared his throat, and then said in a grave tone, "Master, you don't know, but all this is because of the suppression of the Ancestral Heavenly Realm. Otherwise, the four immortal emperors would have broken through their shackles long ago, and their lifespans would not be nearing their end, still lingering in the four realms."</p><p></p><p>Hearing the words "Ancestral Heavenly Realm", Lu Changsheng suddenly thought of Xiaotong. </p><p></p><p>He didn't know if her next life would be in the four realms, he could use the Great Dao Eyes to take a look, but there was no need.</p><p></p><p>"Hmm, why are they suppressing them?" </p><p></p><p>Lu Changsheng asked lightly, as if the four words "Ancestral Heavenly Realm" could not stir the slightest ripple in his heart.</p><p></p><p>The old turtle sighed: "It's all because of their positions. If the four immortal emperors go to the Ancestral Heavenly Realm, they must serve under the divine emperors there. But I heard that the positions in the Ancestral Heavenly Realm are not enough to be distributed, so some people in the Ancestral Heavenly Realm have started to suppress the four realms, trying to exhaust the four immortal emperors to death in their realms."</p><p></p><p>"If the four immortal emperors are exhausted to death in the four realms, then apart from your Central Immortal Realm, the other four realms will collapse without the support of the immortal emperor's power. It will be a disaster for all living beings!"</p><p></p><p>"Regarding this, the four immortal emperors naturally cannot accept it, but those people are blocking the divine path... The four immortal emperors are completely helpless."</p><p></p><p>Towards the end, the old turtle sighed helplessly!</p><p></p><p>In the four realms, the five immortal realms, each realm is only allowed to have one immortal emperor!</p><p></p><p>It is only when they reach a certain point that the immortal emperor can break through the shackles and go to the Ancestral Realm. And with the remnant power of the previous immortal emperor still in the realm, it is enough to support until the next generation of immortal emperor takes over!</p><p></p><p>At that time, the transition will be perfect.</p><p></p><p>In the four realms, the old turtle can be said to be the first under Lu Changsheng!</p><p></p><p>Relying on the old turtle's relationship with the four immortal emperors, he would naturally lend a hand, but in the end he was also beaten back, and the four immortal emperors were even seriously injured, unable to fight back at all...</p><p></p><p>If it weren't for the turtle shell's hardness, the old turtle was afraid he would have been injured as well.</p><p></p><p>He was just a turtle, after all!</p><p></p><p>In a certain sense, his strongest suit was defense, not attack.</p><p></p><p>Lu Changsheng closed his eyes and said faintly,</p><p></p><p>"No matter, when the time comes, I will break through the divine path, and the Ancestral Heavenly Realm will have to... beg those four fellows to go up."</p>

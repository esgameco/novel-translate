        <div class="content">
            <p>Here is the full English translation of the Chinese excerpt:</p><p></p><p>Night. [̲̅6][̲̅9][̲̅s][̲̅h][̲̅u][̲̅x][̲̅.][̲̅c][̲̅o][̲̅m]</p><p></p><p>Su Lianyi quietly slipped out of the Upper Clarity Palace. After some time, she arrived at a mountain peak.</p><p></p><p>On the mountain peak, a middle-aged man was already waiting for her.</p><p></p><p>When the middle-aged man saw Su Lianyi arrive, a smile appeared on his face, and he went to greet her, gently calling out, "Lianyi, you've come."</p><p></p><p>He reached out his hand, wanting to hold Su Lianyi's hand, but was avoided by Su Lianyi.</p><p></p><p>Yuan Yang Qiu paused, shook his head with a bitter smile, and didn't say much.</p><p></p><p>He then asked, "Lianyi, you summoned me to this mountain peak. What is the matter?"</p><p></p><p>Yuan Yang Qiu knew that Su Lianyi would not call him here without reason.</p><p></p><p>As the leader of a sect, he was summoned by Su Lianyi at her will, and he knew this was very embarrassing for him, but... he was willing.</p><p></p><p>After all, he deeply loved Su Lianyi, this beautiful and kind-hearted woman. Moreover, she was the Holy Maiden of the Upper Clarity Palace, and to him, if he could obtain Su Lianyi, his plans would progress faster and smoother.</p><p></p><p>"Sect Master Yuan, haven't you always wanted to become my cultivation partner?" Su Lianyi suddenly looked at him intently.</p><p></p><p>Yuan Yang Qiu's eyes lit up, and a look of surprise appeared on his face. "Lianyi, haven't you always been resistant to this? How come today..."</p><p></p><p>Su Lianyi waved her hand to interrupt him. "If you help me with one matter, I will become your cultivation partner."</p><p></p><p>"Haha, Lianyi, it doesn't have to be just one matter. Even if it's ten matters, my sect will help you!" Yuan Yang Qiu waved his hand grandly, his mood greatly improved.</p><p></p><p>Then, as if remembering something, his brow furrowed as he continued, "However, Lianyi, your master, Sect Leader Yun, may interfere with our becoming cultivation partners. This..."</p><p></p><p>Su Lianyi coldly said, "Sect Master Yuan, you don't need to worry about that. As long as you can help me with this matter, I will explain it to my master!"</p><p></p><p>Hearing this, Yuan Yang Qiu's brow relaxed, and he smiled, "Okay, then my sect will be at ease. Tell me, what does Lianyi want my sect to help with?"</p><p></p><p>"It's simple. In our Cang Domain, there is a remote small town called Yanyu, and in it, there is a Longevity Medical Hall." Su Lianyi took a deep breath and continued, "In that Longevity Medical Hall, there is a little girl. You go and kidnap that little girl and bring her to me."</p><p></p><p>This simple? </p><p></p><p>Yuan Yang Qiu raised his eyebrows, paused for a moment, and then smiled, "That Longevity Medical Hall... It can't be that simple, right?"</p><p></p><p>If it were truly that simple, Su Lianyi wouldn't have come to ask for his help.</p><p></p><p>And just now, he had already deduced some things...</p><p></p><p>That so-called little girl in the Longevity Medical Hall must be no ordinary person, or else Su Lianyi wouldn't be so eager.</p><p></p><p>And also, Su Lianyi didn't want the Upper Clarity Palace to know about this matter, otherwise why would she seek his help instead of asking her own elders or the Palace Master?</p><p></p><p>"You're right, I can't deal with the owner of that medical hall." Su Lianyi said in a serious tone.</p><p></p><p>She knew that Yuan Yang Qiu, as the leader of a sect, was not a mindless person.</p><p></p><p>Sure enough, the next moment, she heard Yuan Yang Qiu say, "Lianyi, just tell me the full story - who is the little girl in that medical hall, why is she so important to you, and why don't you want to tell the Upper Clarity Palace about this?"</p><p></p><p>Su Lianyi was not surprised. After looking deeply at Yuan Yang Qiu, she directly told the whole story.</p><p></p><p>A moment later,</p><p></p><p>"What? The Jade Maiden's Profound Body!"</p><p></p><p>Hearing about the Jade Maiden's Profound Body, even Yuan Yang Qiu's heart was set ablaze!</p><p></p><p>"So you want to refine the Jade Maiden's Profound Body of that little girl?" Yuan Yang Qiu looked at Su Lianyi, his eyes flickering.</p><p></p><p>From this moment on, the gentleness and kindness that Su Lianyi had in his heart diminished a bit...</p><p></p><p>But Yuan Yang Qiu wouldn't say anything, as such matters were commonplace in the cultivation world, and nothing out of the ordinary.</p><p></p><p>However, his impression of Su Lianyi had changed...</p><p></p><p>Here is the full English translation of the Chinese excerpt:</p><p></p><p>It's not as good as before, this is the reality.</p><p></p><p>"Not bad, if I can plunder her Jade Maiden Mysterious Body, once we form a Dao Companion, it will benefit both of us, won't it?" </p><p></p><p>Su Lianyi averted her gaze from Yuan Yangqiu and said indifferently.</p><p></p><p>"What cultivation level might that Azure-robed Cultivator be at?" Yuan Yangqiu asked.</p><p></p><p>Su Lianyi's eyes flickered, the face of Lu Changsheng surfacing in her mind, she pondered and said, "Perhaps a Transcendent Immortal Lord, perhaps an Immortal King, an Immortal Venerable... or even a possibility."</p><p></p><p>Yuan Yangqiu was slightly surprised, based on what Su Lianyi said, he couldn't quite understand why such a powerful expert, possibly an Immortal Venerable, would be hiding in that remote little town.</p><p></p><p>"Then it's good, an Immortal Venerable... won't stir up much of a storm, let's wait for news from the sect."</p><p></p><p>Yuan Yangqiu disappeared from the mountain peak in a flash.</p><p></p><p>Su Lianyi looked at the spot where Yuan Yangqiu had vanished, her expression blank, calm as the abyss... </p><p></p><p>Her originally beautiful and enchanting countenance, under the gusts of cold wind, seemed to have taken on an ominous air for some reason.</p><p></p><p>...</p><p></p><p>The next day.</p><p></p><p>Smoke and Rain Town.</p><p></p><p>"Ouch! Ouch! It's going to explode! Doctor Lu, save me!!"</p><p></p><p>Luo Gu was running wildly on the street, shouting with all his might!</p><p></p><p>This caused quite a few townspeople to be stunned, not knowing what had gotten into this fellow Luo Gu.</p><p></p><p>"What's wrong with old Luo this time?"</p><p></p><p>"Who knows, this old fellow is only normal when selling buns, other than that, when has he ever been well-behaved?"</p><p></p><p>"That's true, since we're free anyway, let's go take a look at the excitement."</p><p></p><p>Many townspeople started heading towards the Longevity Medical Clinic to the southwest while discussing.</p><p></p><p>Outside the Longevity Medical Clinic.</p><p></p><p>Luo Gu's face was deathly pale, his figure swift, as he hunched over and rushed with all his might.</p><p></p><p>He dashed into the medical clinic in a flash.</p><p></p><p>"Doctor Lu! Please save this old man! It's really going to explode!!"</p><p></p><p>Luo Gu's wails echoed through the medical clinic.</p><p></p><p>Inside the medical clinic.</p><p></p><p>Tong Xin and Xiao Tong looked at the rolling Luo Gu on the ground with some bewilderment.</p><p></p><p>Seeing Luo Gu in such agony, drenched in sweat, Xiao Tong couldn't bear it, and remembering what the Master had said yesterday, and having studied medicine all night...</p><p></p><p>She timidly stepped forward and said, "Grandpa Luo, the Master hasn't woken up yet, you look to be in a lot of pain, why don't you let little Tong take a look?"</p><p></p><p>"Huh?" The swollen and agonizing Luo Gu was startled, his old face flushing red, he hurriedly waved his hand, trembling with pain as he said, "Tong, Tong'er, Grandpa Luo's illness, you can't treat it, I still need Doctor Lu, good girl, step aside!"</p><p></p><p>He then resumed rolling on the ground.</p><p></p><p>Seeing Luo Gu in such pain, Xiao Tong's eyes reddened, feeling deeply self-reproachful.</p><p></p><p>Indeed, she had just started learning medicine, her medical skills were not proficient, and her experience was lacking, even Grandpa Luo didn't trust her.</p><p></p><p>She was useless, could only watch as Grandpa Luo suffered.</p><p></p><p>Tong Xin sighed, then suddenly went to Luo Gu's side, stabilizing his figure, and gently infusing some Immortal Qi to try and alleviate Luo Gu's pain.</p><p></p><p>But to their surprise, Luo Gu's wails only grew more agonizing!</p><p></p><p>Tong Xin was dumbfounded!</p><p></p><p>What was going on?</p><p></p><p>Just then, Lu Changsheng came out from behind the curtain, yawning.</p><p></p><p>Luo Gu was like a drowning man grabbing a lifesaver, breaking free from Tong Xin, he rushed over and hugged Lu Changsheng's leg, snot and tears streaming, "Doctor Lu, please save this old man! I'm really going to die."</p><p></p><p>"Serves you right." Lu Changsheng looked down at him and said, "Didn't I tell you that if you took that medicine a second time, it would harm your body?"</p><p></p><p>"You did, you did! It's this old man's greed and lack of obedience to the doctor's orders! Doctor Lu, save me, I'll never dare again!" Luo Gu was in tears.</p><p></p><p>Lu Changsheng squatted down, flipping his hand to place a medicinal pill into Luo Gu's mouth, and laughed, "I let you suffer a bit more just now, have you learned your lesson?"</p><p></p><p>"I have, I have!"</p>

        <h1>Chapter 56</h1>
        <div class="content">
            <p>Here is the full English translation of the Chinese excerpt:</p><p></p><p>"If I were to wage war, would you, would you care?" Jiwuqing asked dryly.</p><p></p><p>As for this, she was also at a loss, after all, this young man in green was a mysterious and powerful figure who had emerged from the immortal tomb, extremely strange.</p><p></p><p>Even at this moment, Jiwuqing could hardly guarantee her own life.</p><p></p><p>Lu Changsheng looked at her meaningfully, then suddenly picked up the gourd and walked out of the tavern.</p><p></p><p>"You'll compensate for the damage in the tavern, and I'll also cut off your right arm as a light punishment."</p><p></p><p>Pfft!</p><p></p><p>Jiwuqing opened her mouth, wanting to say something, but her right arm detached mysteriously and fell to the ground...</p><p></p><p>Blood gushed out like a fountain!</p><p></p><p>Fortunately, the oppressive force pressing down on her had disappeared, and she quickly activated her magical energy to stop the bleeding.</p><p></p><p>She silently picked up her own arm, her gaze trembling, and remained silent for a long time.</p><p></p><p>The idea of waging war on the Lingchen Realm also began to waver.</p><p></p><p>Because she could not fathom Lu Changsheng's thoughts at all.</p><p></p><p>Lu Changsheng was like an extremely terrifying variable, making it difficult for her to settle her mind.</p><p></p><p>But at the moment, she also had many other thoughts in her mind,</p><p></p><p>such as since a mysterious and powerful figure had emerged from the immortal tomb, what about the other immortal tombs?</p><p></p><p>Would there be similar undefeated experts like Lu Changsheng in each tomb? Or were the secrets of longevity buried in the other tombs?</p><p></p><p>Why did he not perish but was in the tomb? How did he manage to break out of the tomb, which was so sturdy? Even if he broke out due to his towering cultivation, why did the entire tomb disappear without a trace...</p><p></p><p>At this moment, countless doubts seemed to be about to burst her mind.</p><p></p><p>...</p><p></p><p>After a moment,</p><p></p><p>"Phew."</p><p></p><p>Jiwuqing let out a long sigh and tossed a gold coin onto the table.</p><p></p><p>At this time, Zhang Cheng cautiously poked his head out from inside, and seeing that Lu Changsheng was not there, he carefully came out and looked at the dejected Jiwuqing, saying,</p><p></p><p>"Miss, there is still some peach blossom wine left in the cellar. Do you want some?"</p><p></p><p>Jiwuqing turned her head to look at him and asked, "Does that gentleman... live in this small town?"</p><p></p><p>Zhang Cheng was taken aback, then quickly responded, "You mean the master? Well, miss, the master comes and goes without a trace, and he only occasionally comes to buy peach blossom wine. As for whether he lives in this Moyu Town, that's hard to say... Ah! Your hand..."</p><p></p><p>Zhang Cheng was awkwardly speaking when he suddenly noticed the arm that Jiwuqing was holding... Due to the angle, he only now realized that the young lady had a severed arm...Hiss!</p><p></p><p>Jiwuqing pursed her lips, her figure gradually fading and disappearing from the spot.</p><p></p><p>Zhang Cheng stared blankly at the place where the lady had stood, thinking to himself that this woman was indeed also a celestial being, but now his impression of the usually gentle Lu Changsheng had also changed a bit.</p><p></p><p>"Although the master appears gentle, when it comes to certain matters, he is not an easy person to deal with."</p><p></p><p>..........</p><p></p><p>Midday.</p><p></p><p>Rumble...</p><p></p><p>Dark clouds covered the sky above Moyu Town, with muffled thunders, indicating that it was about to rain.</p><p></p><p>The people on the street saw this and hurriedly ran home, not wanting to linger on the streets and get drenched.</p><p></p><p>In the backyard of the town lord's mansion.</p><p></p><p>Gu Helin rushed in anxiously, looking at the figure in the pavilion and urgently said,</p><p></p><p>"Master, Helin's thunder tribulation..."</p><p></p><p>Lu Changsheng stood up and went over to him, saying, "When the tribulation comes, the thunder will roar loudly. Have you made all the preparations?"</p><p></p><p>Gu Helin solemnly said, "Master, rest assured, there are no more civilians on the mountains outside the town, and Helin has also informed the town lord. No matter what happens, all the civilians are not allowed to leave the town."</p><p></p><p>"Haha, with the master helping you, you little cultivator are truly blessed for generations to come."</p><p></p><p>At this time, the old turtle on the stone table in the pavilion suddenly manifested a human form and came over, teasing,</p><p></p><p>"Ah, this..."</p><p></p><p>Gu Helin was dumbfounded.</p><p></p><p>He had just seen the turtle turn into a person.</p><p></p><p>Here is the full English translation of the Chinese excerpt:</p><p></p><p>"...and more importantly,</p><p></p><p>The new 69 book bar 99 SHU.COM</p><p></p><p>This is the hunchbacked old man who appeared on the city wall three years ago!!</p><p></p><p>At first, I was curious about why the master's powerful servant had never been seen, </p><p>but in the end, it turned out that the turtle they often saw was him!!</p><p></p><p>'The senior is right,' Ancient Crane Lin said awkwardly as he bowed.</p><p></p><p>At the same time, he looked up at the sky, and the sense of unease grew stronger.</p><p>The thunder tribulation is about to come!</p><p></p><p>'You talk too much, don't you?' Lu Changsheng glanced sideways at the old turtle.</p><p></p><p>The old turtle trembled and laughed awkwardly.</p><p></p><p>'Let's go.'</p><p></p><p>Lu Changsheng waved his sleeve.</p><p></p><p>Ancient Crane Lin hadn't reacted yet when the scene changed.</p><p>They were no longer in the backyard of the lord's mansion, but in the mountains where he had set up the formation...</p><p></p><p>'Oh, Crane Lin, the formation you set up is so trash, can it withstand the thunder tribulation?' </p><p>The old turtle looked around and laughed.</p><p></p><p>Ancient Crane Lin smiled awkwardly, he dared not be negligent towards Lu Changsheng's servant, who was extremely powerful...</p><p></p><p>Lu Changsheng sighed and lightly kicked out.</p><p></p><p>The old turtle's expression changed, </p><p>this kick was completely unexpected, before he could react, he was kicked!</p><p></p><p>His body flew out rapidly, crashing violently into the mountain, piercing through and flying out the other side.</p><p></p><p>Boom!!</p><p></p><p>The continuous mountains shook violently, as if they were about to split apart at any moment.</p><p></p><p>Seeing this, the old turtle was alarmed. Enduring the pain, he waved his hand, and the mountains became calm again.</p><p>He appeared beside Lu Changsheng, rubbing his aching chest awkwardly, 'Master, you can't be so hard on old turtle in front of the junior... I was wrong!!'</p><p></p><p>He hadn't finished speaking when he saw Lu Changsheng raising his hand again, and quickly retreated several steps!</p><p></p><p>Ancient Crane Lin came to his senses, swallowing hard, carefully looking at Lu Changsheng, feeling his throat extremely dry.</p><p>It's too terrifying.</p><p></p><p>Huh, something's not right! The uneasy feeling in his heart has disappeared, where's the thunder tribulation?</p><p></p><p>Ancient Crane Lin suddenly realized something, looking up at the sky, the dark clouds had disappeared, and the rumbling thunder had also stopped...</p><p>The sky is clear, what the hell is going on!</p><p></p><p>'Uh, sir, I'm sorry, it seems the thunder tribulation won't be coming for now...' </p><p></p><p>Ancient Crane Lin said respectfully with an apologetic expression.</p><p></p><p>He felt very guilty for making Lu Changsheng come here in vain.</p><p>He was also extremely frustrated, this thunder tribulation is like a woman's menstrual cycle, when it will come is unpredictable!!</p><p></p><p>The old turtle glanced at the Lu Changsheng who was looking up at the sky, feeling a bit gleeful.</p><p>He, who had just been reprimanded by Lu Changsheng, suddenly felt a bit sympathetic towards this small Dao of the Spiritual Dust Realm.</p><p></p><p>At the same time,</p><p>On the city wall of Moyu Town,</p><p>Chen Dadao and the steward also looked up at the sky in bewilderment, didn't the ancient immortal say he would lead a thunder tribulation?</p><p>How come there's no thunder at all, and the sky is clear?</p><p></p><p>'Lord, just now there was a huge roar and tremor coming from the mountains, it was so terrifying that we could feel it clearly even in Moyu Town, luckily it was just for a moment.' The old steward said apprehensively, his old bones almost fell apart, it was like the end of the world.</p><p></p><p>'Well, but don't worry, with the master here, everything is not a problem.' Chen Dadao laughed heartily.</p><p></p><p>Just then,</p><p>A calm voice sounded from the mountains.</p><p></p><p>'Summon the thunder.'</p><p></p><p>That, isn't that the master's voice? The master is also in those mountains!</p><p></p><p>Immediately after, Chen Dadao and the steward were stunned to see the dark clouds quickly gathering in the sky, and the rumbling thunder sounding again...</p><p>But the rhythm of the thunder seemed a bit hesitant...</p><p></p><p>'Can't you hear me summoning the thunder? Disobedient child... time for a spanking.'</p><p></p><p>Chen Dadao and the steward listened to Lu Changsheng's voice, their hearts suddenly pounding!</p><p></p><p>A dazzling bolt of lightning abruptly struck down from the sky towards the mountains!</p><p></p><p>The two instinctively covered their ears,</p><p></p><p>Rumble!!!</p><p></p><p>The sound of this lightning bolt was unprecedented, the entire Moyu Town was in a panic!"</p>

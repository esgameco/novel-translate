        <h1>Chapter 498</h1>
        <div class="content">
            <p>Here is the full English translation of the Chinese excerpt:</p><p></p><p>"Hey, the arrival of the leaders of the peak forces has made our Elf Clan shine with prosperity!"</p><p></p><p>At the entrance of the Elf Clan, the aged Elf Clan Chief stepped forward and greeted them with a smile.</p><p></p><p>Behind him were the Elf Clan's upper echelons, all standing with bowed heads.</p><p></p><p>"Haha, Elf Clan Chief, no need for such formalities, let's quickly head into the venue."</p><p></p><p>"That's right, since the nine peak forces have all arrived, we should quickly hold the ceremony. It's not like we're in a hurry, our Clan Chief still has many matters to attend to within the clan."</p><p></p><p>"......"</p><p></p><p>The leaders of the nine forces spoke one after another.</p><p></p><p>In the Chu Clan camp, Chu Yu stood coldly and arrogantly behind the Chu Clan Chief, but did not say a word.</p><p></p><p>At this moment, there were all big shots present, and although his status was not low, he did not have the right to interject.</p><p></p><p>Chu Yu's gaze was cold and fierce. During this period, due to the matter of the Myriad World Calamity Body, he had been so angry that he couldn't do anything properly!</p><p></p><p>So Chu Yu decided that after attending the grand ceremony, he must find a way to go to the Qian Kun Heavens again!</p><p></p><p>As for the Myriad World Calamity Body, that was a different matter. Chu Yu now only wanted to eliminate Lu Changsheng!</p><p></p><p>Otherwise, that Lu Changsheng would be like a demonic thought, constantly tormenting him.</p><p></p><p>"Haha, how lively."</p><p></p><p>At this moment, two figures suddenly appeared outside the Elf Clan.</p><p></p><p>When everyone looked over, they were instantly shocked!</p><p></p><p>Even the nine peak force leaders had a change of expression!</p><p></p><p>Because the two who had arrived were the President of the Sea Trade Association, Thunder Saint, and the Land Saint King of the Three Thousand Dharma Realms, Flame Saint.</p><p></p><p>Two Dao Comprehension realm experts!</p><p></p><p>In the Three Thousand Dharma Realms, there were a total of five Dao Comprehension realm experts!</p><p></p><p>In addition to the President of the Sea Trade Association and the Land Saint King, the remaining three belonged to the nine peak forces as their patriarchs.</p><p></p><p>They were from the Demon Subduing Valley, the Nine Underworld River Palace, and the Chu Clan!</p><p></p><p>"Greetings, President and Saint King!"</p><p></p><p>Although the crowd was puzzled as to why these two heavyweight experts had suddenly visited, they still hurriedly paid their respects, even the nine peak force leaders slightly bowed to show their reverence for the Dao Comprehension experts.</p><p></p><p>In the Chu Clan camp, Chu Yu bowed respectfully, his heart filled with passion and ambition!</p><p></p><p>This was the prestige of Dao Comprehension realm experts!</p><p></p><p>Even the nine peak force leaders had to bow their heads!</p><p></p><p>In the future, he, Chu Yu, would also definitely comprehend the essence of the Dao of Light and achieve Dao Comprehension!</p><p></p><p>At that time, this Three Thousand Dharma Realms would gain another Light Saint!</p><p></p><p>Although his clan's patriarch was already a Light Saint, the patriarch was already too old and about to pass away.</p><p></p><p>As the strongest of the new generation of the Chu Clan, he, Chu Yu, naturally had the obligation and responsibility to inherit the title of Light Saint from the patriarch!</p><p></p><p>The future glory of the Chu Clan would be guarded by him, Chu Yu!</p><p></p><p>"Haha, no need for such formalities, everyone please rise."</p><p></p><p>The President of the Sea Trade Association smiled and gently lifted everyone up.</p><p></p><p>"Thank you, President and Saint King." The crowd exclaimed in unison.</p><p></p><p>The Elf Clan Chief hurriedly stepped forward and said, "President, Saint King, please come and take a seat in our clan."</p><p></p><p>The arrival of the President of the Sea Trade Association and the Land Saint King directly shifted the Elf Clan Chief's enthusiasm and focus.</p><p></p><p>Seeing this, the nine peak force leaders could only sigh inwardly, not daring to voice any opinions.</p><p></p><p>They were now very curious as to why these two had suddenly descended upon the Elf Clan.</p><p></p><p>"Mm."</p><p></p><p>The President of the Sea Trade Association inexplicably glanced at the Chu Clan camp, then followed the Land Saint King, led by the Elf Clan, towards the ceremony venue.</p><p></p><p>The Chu Clan Chief was dumbfounded, not knowing the meaning behind the President of the Sea Trade Association's gaze.</p><p></p><p>"Chu Clan Chief, does your Chu Clan have some enmity with the Sea Trade Association?"</p><p></p><p>"No, I've never heard of that."</p><p></p><p>"The gaze of Thunder Saint just now seemed to be laden with deep meaning."</p><p></p><p>"......"</p><p></p><p>The nine peak force leaders spoke one after another, but their words were tinged with a sense of wanting to watch the show.</p><p></p><p>"My Chu Clan hasn't had much interaction with the Sea Trade Association recently, so how could there be any enmity? Hmph!"</p><p></p><p>The Chu Clan Chief waved his sleeve and led Chu Yu and the other clan members into the venue first.</p><p></p><p>The other eight force leaders then exchanged glances.</p><p></p><p>The sudden arrival of the two Dao Comprehension experts might indeed be related to the Chu Clan. Perhaps there would be some juicy gossip to witness today.</p><p></p><p>.........</p><p></p><p>In the venue, the various forces were seated according to their rankings, with the nine peak forces naturally occupying the front row. In front of everyone were tables laden with fruits, fine wines, and delicacies.</p><p></p><p>Here is the full English translation of the Chinese excerpt:</p><p></p><p>Food.</p><p></p><p>The Chairman of the Maritime Trade Association and the Terrestrial Sacred King, two powerful Dao masters, were sitting aside, seemingly out of place.</p><p></p><p>But the minds of everyone in the venue were almost all focused on the two of them.</p><p></p><p>"... The formal division and exchange of the Climbing Island is about to beginâ€”"</p><p></p><p>Soon, after the Elf Clan Leader had finished reading the opening ceremony, just about to move on to the next segment.</p><p></p><p>The Maritime Trade Association Chairman suddenly waved his hand:</p><p></p><p>"Wait a moment."</p><p></p><p>Huh...</p><p></p><p>The entire venue paused, and everyone's gaze became subtle.</p><p></p><p>The Elf Clan Leader was taken aback and said confusedly, "Chairman, you are..."</p><p></p><p>The Maritime Trade Association Chairman smiled faintly, slowly coming over to the Elf Clan Leader.</p><p></p><p>Seeing this, the Elf Clan Leader also understood that he had something to say, and retreated half a step.</p><p></p><p>"I suppose everyone is curious about the arrival of this Chairman and the Terrestrial Sacred King."</p><p></p><p>As the Maritime Trade Association Chairman said this, he suddenly looked towards the Nine Peak Forces, saying meaningfully:</p><p></p><p>"It seems the incident on the Ascending Heaven Island has not yet reached you all..."</p><p></p><p>Beside him, the Terrestrial Sacred King's eyes flashed with a look of relishing the show. He had come with the Maritime Trade Association Chairman today just to enjoy the show.</p><p></p><p>Watching the dogs bite each other, isn't that wonderful?</p><p></p><p>...</p><p></p><p>What incident happened on the Ascending Heaven Island?</p><p></p><p>What could have possibly happened on the Ascending Heaven Island?</p><p></p><p>In the venue, everyone had question marks floating above their heads, looking puzzledly at the Maritime Trade Association Chairman.</p><p></p><p>The leaders of the Nine Peak Forces also had flickering gazes, for some reason, a sense of foreboding arose in their hearts...</p><p></p><p>A figure of the Maritime Trade Association Chairman's caliber would not make a boring joke.</p><p></p><p>What exactly happened on the Ascending Heaven Island that caused the arrival of these two Dao masters?</p><p></p><p>"Chairman, if you know something, please just say it directly, we are all ears!" </p><p></p><p>The Chu Clan Leader, remembering his previous gaze, couldn't sit still and stood up, cupping his hands.</p><p></p><p>"This matter... is actually very much related to your Chu Clan, very much so." The Maritime Trade Association Chairman then said:</p><p></p><p>"Recently, in the central territory of the Ascending Heaven Island, a senior elder of your Chu Clan and all his disciples were annihilated by the joint forces of the other eight powers, are you aware of this?"</p><p></p><p>What?!</p><p></p><p>This statement was like a huge rock, splashing into a calm pond!</p><p></p><p>Everyone in the venue abruptly stood up, their gazes turning horrified!</p><p></p><p>Except for the dumbfounded Chu Clan, the other eight peak forces were also bewildered!</p><p></p><p>Impossible!</p><p></p><p>Absolutely impossible!!!</p><p></p><p>Without their orders and approval, how could those clan members of the Chu Clan have joined forces to attack the Chu Clan?</p><p></p><p>Why would they destroy the Chu Clan so well?!</p><p></p><p>"Chairman, we respect your status, but some words cannot be spoken carelessly!"</p><p></p><p>"That's right! This matter is too absurd!"</p><p></p><p>The speakers were the Demon Subduing Valley Lord and the Nine Underworld River Palace Master.</p><p></p><p>These two forces had Dao Ancestor backing them, so naturally they dared to question the Maritime Trade Association Chairman.</p><p></p><p>The Chu Clan Leader's face turned ashen, and the sense of foreboding in his heart grew even stronger!</p><p></p><p>He glared ominously at the leaders of the eight forces, although the news had not yet arrived, although it was extremely absurd and ridiculous, but his rationality told him that what the Maritime Trade Association Chairman said was all true!</p><p></p><p>Just then, the transmission from the distant Ascending Heaven Island finally rang out on the jade tokens of the major force leaders in the venue!</p><p></p><p>Instantly, the entire venue atmosphere became tense!</p><p></p><p>Everyone's eyes flashed with disbelief, while the Chu Clan members' faces changed drastically!</p><p></p><p>The Maritime Trade Association Chairman and the Terrestrial Sacred King exchanged a glance, their eyes flashing with schadenfreude!</p><p></p><p>"You, you bastards!! My Chu Clan will never be on good terms with you!!! Ahhhhh!"</p><p></p><p>The Chu Clan Leader instantly lost the rationality of a great clan leader, and the powerful laws of his body suddenly erupted!</p><p></p><p>Dazzling flashes of light began to flicker rapidly in the venue!</p><p></p><p>Chu Yu, however, still had his reason and could not act rashly, for if the Chu Clan alone charged in, they would be beaten to a pulp by the other eight forces!</p><p></p><p>At this moment, Chu Yu's expression was like he had eaten shit.</p><p></p><p>Why, why did this absurd event happen?</p><p></p><p>Why?!</p>

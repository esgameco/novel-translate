        <h1>Chapter 449</h1>
        <div class="content">
            <p>Here is the full English translation of the Chinese excerpt:</p><p></p><p>Ye Xunwang dreamed of his childhood, dreaming of the scenes when his father was still alive...</p><p></p><p>"Father, won't you compete with my uncle for the position of the clan leader?"</p><p></p><p>"Forget it, Xunwang, your uncle is more suited to be the head of the Ye Clan than I am."</p><p></p><p>"Father, you're talking nonsense. In my eyes, your abilities are clearly superior to my uncle's. You and my uncle are both grandpa's sons, you are brothers, why must you let him have it?!"</p><p></p><p>"It's precisely because you are brothers that I don't want you to destroy each other! A clan like that can't last long!!!"</p><p></p><p>"Father, you..."</p><p></p><p>"What do you know! Shut up!!"</p><p></p><p>Slap!!!</p><p></p><p>Ye Xunwang's eyes were filled with tears as he abruptly opened them!</p><p></p><p>Ye Nantian saw that Ye Xunwang had woken up, and withdrew his palm, gently asking, "It seems you had a nightmare, but fortunately your uncle woke you up."</p><p></p><p>Ye Xunwang was silent for a moment, then said, "Uncle, thank you."</p><p></p><p>Ye Nantian waved his hand, "There's no need to thank me, I'm your uncle, it's only natural."</p><p></p><p>Ye Nantian saw that Ye Xunwang lowered his head and didn't speak, so he cleared his throat and asked with a smile, "Xunwang, when you returned to the clan, were you alone?"</p><p></p><p>"No, there was also an elder." Ye Xunwang answered subconsciously, then suddenly jumped up from the bed, exclaiming, "I almost forgot, the elder is still with Ye Feng, I don't know if Ye Feng has been taking good care of him. I have to go and check!"</p><p></p><p>As he spoke, Ye Xunwang got out of bed.</p><p></p><p>Ye Nantian's eyes flickered, and he quickly stopped him, "Don't be in a hurry, your elder is fine now."</p><p></p><p>Then Ye Nantian told Ye Xunwang about Lu Changsheng being in the Cangwu Pavilion, and said that the pavilion master was watching over him.</p><p></p><p>Hearing this, Ye Xunwang's mood gradually calmed down. "That's good."</p><p></p><p>Ye Nantian came over and sat down, pouring himself a cup of tea and also pouring one for Ye Xunwang, "Come, sit with your uncle and have a cup of tea."</p><p></p><p>Ye Xunwang hurriedly went over, saying, "How dare I let my uncle pour the tea, this is something Xunwang should do."</p><p></p><p>"Hehe, no problem." Ye Nantian took a sip of the tea, then asked, "Xunwang, the one who came back with you is..."</p><p></p><p>Ye Xunwang had already guessed that Ye Nantian would ask this, and based on what he had said earlier, he knew that the Cangwu Pavilion master had seen that the elder was no ordinary person.</p><p></p><p>"Uncle, the elder is someone Xunwang met in the outside world..."</p><p></p><p>Ye Xunwang found that he didn't know what else to say, he suddenly realized that he didn't even know the elder's name.</p><p></p><p>Ye Nantian: "That's it?"</p><p></p><p>Ye Xunwang: "That's it."</p><p></p><p>Ye Nantian: "......"</p><p></p><p>Ye Nantian looked at Ye Xunwang suspiciously, then asked, "Why did this Lu friend come back with you?"</p><p></p><p>Lu friend? </p><p></p><p>Ye Xunwang was first confused, but soon reacted, surprised, "Uncle, you actually know the elder's surname, how embarrassing that I, for so long, didn't even know the elder's name."</p><p></p><p>Ye Nantian was speechless.</p><p></p><p>Wow, he didn't even know the name, yet he dared to say he knew him?</p><p></p><p>Ye Xunwang secretly remembered this surname, then quickly replied, "Uncle, don't worry, the elder came to the Donghuxu Realm for his own private matters."</p><p></p><p>Ye Xunwang said this to try to dispel Ye Nantian's doubts from the side.</p><p></p><p>After all, bringing back a powerful expert, Ye Nantian as the clan leader would naturally feel a bit uneasy.</p><p></p><p>Ye Nantian nodded, "What private matters does he have?"</p><p></p><p>"Cough cough, Uncle, you're joking, of course Xunwang doesn't know." Ye Xunwang laughed awkwardly.</p><p></p><p>His childhood feeling was right, his father was more suited to be the clan leader than his uncle.</p><p></p><p>After all, what kind of clan leader asks questions so clumsily.</p><p></p><p>Ye Nantian suddenly stood up, looking out the window and sighing, "It's only been 30,000 years, and the Donghuxu Realm is about to be in turmoil again."</p><p></p><p>Here is the full English translation of the Chinese excerpt:</p><p></p><p>"Ah......"</p><p></p><p>Ye Xunwang looked at Ye Nantian's desolate back, not knowing what the sudden remark meant.</p><p></p><p>Ye Nantian turned around and solemnly said to Ye Xunwang, "Xunwang, when the turmoil comes, having one more Xianxu Realm expert will provide more protection."</p><p></p><p>Ye Xunwang looked at Ye Nantian blankly, not knowing what his uncle had suddenly gone crazy about.</p><p></p><p>He couldn't understand at all.</p><p></p><p>So he wryly smiled and said, "Uncle, please forgive my stupidity, I don't understand your meaning."</p><p></p><p>Ye Nantian sat back down, took a sip of tea to clear his throat, and then said directly:</p><p></p><p>"Xunwang, your uncle won't beat around the bush anymore. You have a better relationship with that friend Lu, can you ask if he is willing to become a guest elder of our Ye Clan? The benefits and treatment will be absolutely generous, and don't worry, it's just a nominal position, we won't restrict him at all!"</p><p></p><p>Ye Xunwang was stunned for a moment, then frantically shook his head.</p><p></p><p>His uncle must have misunderstood, how could he, Ye Xunwang, have such a good relationship with the Honored Gentleman Lu...</p><p></p><p>And besides...</p><p></p><p>Seeing Ye Xunwang shaking his head, Ye Nantian thought Ye Xunwang was worried about some factors, so he smiled and said:</p><p></p><p>"Xunwang, don't worry, as a top expert of the Xianxu Realm, Lu will be more than qualified to be our Ye Clan's guest elder!"</p><p></p><p>Heh, Xianxu...</p><p></p><p>Ye Xunwang couldn't help but reveal a bitter smile in his eyes.</p><p></p><p>Ye Nantian looked at Ye Xunwang's expression with puzzlement, unable to fathom his thoughts.</p><p></p><p>After pondering for a while, Ye Xunwang looked up and asked, "Uncle, when I returned this time, I encountered a monster outside the Void Ancient Realm, it was covered in tentacles and had a woman's face, very eerie. Do you know what kind of monster that is?"</p><p></p><p>"The Thousand-Tentacle Demon Woman!!" Ye Nantian suddenly stood up, staring at Ye Xunwang in disbelief, blurting out:</p><p></p><p>"You actually encountered the Thousand-Tentacle Demon Woman and didn't die?!"</p><p></p><p>After saying that, Ye Nantian suddenly realized: "Oh, that's right, with that friend Lu, a Xianxu expert, accompanying you, it shouldn't be too difficult to barely escape."</p><p></p><p>Ye Xunwang shook his head bitterly: "Uncle, you're wrong."</p><p></p><p>?</p><p></p><p>Ye Nantian: "Where was I wrong?"</p><p></p><p>Ye Xunwang, recalling the terrifying scene that day, said with reverence:</p><p></p><p>"We didn't run away, that Thousand-Tentacle Demon Woman was destroyed by the Honored Gentleman in one move, leaving not even a trace."</p><p></p><p>What?!</p><p></p><p>Ye Nantian was dumbfounded, then his expression became stern as he waved his hand: "Impossible, absolutely impossible!!"</p><p></p><p>To be able to destroy a Thousand-Tentacle Demon Woman in its own domain, the Void Ancient Realm, with just one move, Ye Nantian knew he couldn't do it, and even if he could, it would come at a terrible price.</p><p></p><p>Moreover, it was just one move? </p><p></p><p>What extraordinary combat power would that require? Late Xianxu Realm or even Xianxu Realm Pinnacle? Certainly not the middle stage!</p><p></p><p>Thinking about this, Ye Nantian's eyes became burning with a hint of reverence.</p><p></p><p>The Xianxu Realm, in the Void Ancient Realm, is already a powerful existence, this is true, but what is being said here is only the early stage of the Xianxu Realm.</p><p></p><p>Ye Nantian himself is in the early stage of the Xianxu Realm.</p><p></p><p>But when the realm reaches the late stage or even the peak, it would be completely different!</p><p></p><p>That would already belong to the strength of the hidden ancestors of the top ancient clans!</p><p></p><p>So, that friend Lu actually possesses the same level of power as their Ye Clan's elders and ancestors!</p><p></p><p>"No! Such a great figure, how can we let a junior like Ye Feng entertain him? I'll go personally!"</p><p></p><p>Ye Nantian hurriedly left.</p><p></p><p>"Uncle, wait for me!" Ye Xunwang was dazed for a moment, then quickly chased after him.</p>

        <h1>Chapter 101</h1>
        <div class="content">
            <p>Here is the full English translation of the Chinese excerpt:</p><p></p><p>Chu Lang, Huang Zhong, and Chen He stood in place, their mouths slightly open. ‚ô§üêç‚ùªÔºô≈û‚Ñç‡∏¢◊ê.‚ìíÔºØùìúüòæ‚ô¨</p><p></p><p>These inspectors had just died like this.</p><p></p><p>Senior Qingyi's methods were truly unheard of and unseen before.</p><p></p><p>The four inspectors who were slapped to death earlier, they could still barely accept that, but when the Eighth-Grade Immortal Celestial was suddenly also blown up, it caught them completely off guard.</p><p></p><p>Even if it were a legendary Great Celestial Immortal, could they really do what Senior Qingyi did?</p><p></p><p>"Thank... thank you, Senior, for your intervention!"</p><p></p><p>Quickly recovering, Chu Lang and the others led their elders to bow down.</p><p></p><p>Lu Changsheng waved his sleeve, lifting hundreds of people in front of him, and said softly, "There's no need to thank me. The matter of the Eternal Grand Sect was already caused by me, and I've ended up implicating you all."</p><p></p><p>"No, no, not at all! Senior, you speak too humbly. How could we be implicated?" Chu Lang hurriedly waved his hands.</p><p></p><p>"Yes, Senior speaks too humbly!" Huang Zhong and Chen He also cupped their hands and bowed.</p><p></p><p>Although this matter was indeed unrelated to them, this Senior had dared to appear in person to face the Inspection Hall, allowing them to avoid being wrongly accused. They felt somewhat moved, otherwise they would have been done for.</p><p></p><p>This Senior had destroyed the Eternal Grand Sect, and he could have stayed out of it, but now he was truly going to be targeted by the Inspection Hall because of them. What a great spirit he had.</p><p></p><p>Lu Changsheng nodded, glancing casually at Chu Xiran and Zhang Youdao in the crowd. This glance made the two of them feel as if they had been electrocuted, clenching their teeth and stubbornly lowering their heads, not daring to make eye contact.</p><p></p><p>Seeing that Lu Changsheng didn't speak, Chu Lang's heart raced, and he gathered his courage to invite, "Senior, would you like to come to my Chu Clan Immortal Sect? My Chu Clan Immortal Sect will surely shine brightly with your arrival!"</p><p></p><p>Huang Zhong and Chen He frowned, looking unhappily at the flushed-faced Chu Lang. Damn it, he moved faster than them!</p><p></p><p>Lu Changsheng nodded slightly: "Okay."</p><p></p><p>The old turtle's mouth twitched at the corners. He knew Lu Changsheng's intention. The five copper-plated inspectors had died in the Langtian Domain, and the Inspection Hall would certainly send people again.</p><p></p><p>At that time, they would still target these three immortal sects.</p><p></p><p>If Lu Changsheng wasn't there, the situation would be worrying.</p><p></p><p>"Okay, okay, okay!" Chu Lang's body trembled, overjoyed. He hurriedly gestured to invite, "Senior, please come with me!"</p><p></p><p>As he spoke, a luxurious and shimmering flying ship appeared in midair.</p><p></p><p>If it was their own travel, they would just fly directly, but with such a great senior, they naturally had to use the most comfortable mode of transportation.</p><p></p><p>Lu Changsheng stepped onto the flying ship, and the old turtle followed suit.</p><p></p><p>"Chu Clan Immortal Sect, let's go!" Chu Lang called out.</p><p></p><p>In a few breaths, the Chu family's flying ship disappeared into the distance under the awe-filled gaze of everyone.</p><p></p><p>"Damn it, this Chu Lang, his brain sometimes works pretty fast!" Huang Zhong looked up and said unhappily.</p><p></p><p>Chen He smiled and said, "This is already a good result. It's better for the Senior to go to any of our three sects than for him to not go to any of them and just leave directly..."</p><p></p><p>Huang Zhong was puzzled and turned his head to look at Chen He. As a clan leader-like figure, his mind was naturally sharp, and he quickly understood the key point.</p><p></p><p>His expression immediately became solemn.</p><p></p><p>"You mean... the Inspection Hall will come again."</p><p></p><p>Chen He's eyes showed seriousness as he asked, "With five inspectors dead, wouldn't it be strange if they didn't come?"</p><p></p><p>Huang Zhong took a deep breath and said solemnly, "We'll go back and quickly prepare a generous gift to send to the Senior!"</p><p></p><p>Although this matter was caused by that Senior, they were the ones being implicated. But in the cruel world of the immortal realm, facing the terrifying Inspection Hall, if that Senior just left, they didn't dare to say anything.</p><p></p><p>Chen He didn't hesitate and nodded: "Okay!"</p><p></p><p>After that, the Huang and Chen families also left in succession, leaving only the still dazed crowd on the square.</p><p></p><p>But soon, the square erupted with countless discussions!</p><p></p><p>Excitement, fear, worship, shock, and even suspicion were all present!</p><p></p><p>"Heavens! Just who is that Senior in blue?"</p><p></p><p>Here is the full English translation of the Chinese excerpt:</p><p></p><p>"What kind of divine being is this? I didn't see him do anything, yet five gold-badge inspectors from the Immortal Realm were killed in a muddle-headed way!" </p><p></p><p>"The lead inspector was even an eighth-rank golden immortal, on par with the former Patriarch of the Eternal Celestial Dynasty - it's truly unbelievable... Honestly, I was stunned just now, not even daring to take a breath."</p><p></p><p>"But the subsequent pursuit by the Inspection Hall, that senior might have difficulty resisting it. At least so far, we haven't heard of anyone who offended the Inspection Hall and came out unscathed, not even Transcendent Immortals."</p><p></p><p>"Ah, that senior is undoubtedly a Transcendent Immortal, and not an ordinary one at that, at least a fourth-rank or above."</p><p></p><p>"Who knows? We haven't really seen Transcendent Immortals before, how would we know their capabilities."</p><p></p><p>"Five inspectors were killed in our Langtian Domain, the Inspection Hall will surely come again. Let's just wait and watch the show."</p><p></p><p>"......"</p><p></p><p>Amidst the various discussions, the crowd of cultivators gradually dispersed, with some having a flickering light in their eyes that was hard to decipher.</p><p></p><p>That young man in green had gone to the Chu Clan Immortal Sect, they had clearly seen that...</p><p></p><p>"Unexpectedly, that old gentleman's master is so terrifyingly powerful..."</p><p></p><p>In the square, the thin man was left in the wind, disheveled.</p><p></p><p>...</p><p></p><p>In the southeastern region of the Fuyao Immortal Continent, a desolate area.</p><p></p><p>Suspended high in the sky was a majestic palace, with clouds and mist merely as its decorations.</p><p></p><p>"Ling'er!! "</p><p></p><p>A middle-aged man, who had been seated in cultivation, suddenly clutched his heart, opening his eyes with a terrifying expression.</p><p></p><p>Taking a deep breath, he shouted, "Come!"</p><p></p><p>Quickly, a gold-badge inspector appeared before the middle-aged man, kneeling respectfully, "I am here, sir!"</p><p></p><p>Zhao Tianyuan stared at the gold-badge inspector, asking frostily, "Where is Zhao Ling?"</p><p></p><p>The gold-badge inspector's heart trembled as he quickly replied, "The young miss has gone to the remote Langtian Domain!"</p><p></p><p>"Langtian... Domain? Such an obscure small domain!" Zhao Tianyuan's voice seemed to be spat out between his teeth, with heavy killing intent.</p><p></p><p>Seeing Zhao Tianyuan's state, the gold-badge inspector mustered his courage to ask, but another inspector had already arrived at the door, anxiously shouting,</p><p></p><p>"Lord Tianyuan! Miss Zhao Ling's token has been shattered!"</p><p></p><p>Immediately, the inspector inside fell silent. He knew why Zhao Tianyuan was so furious, so he lowered his head, holding his breath, afraid of incurring Zhao Tianyuan's wrath.</p><p></p><p>However, he couldn't help but feel a bit happy inside. That Zhao Ling had always bullied the gold-badge inspectors with her status, many of them had long been resentful. Good riddance to her!</p><p></p><p>Zhao Tianyuan slowly stood up, the silver badge at his waist glimmering.</p><p></p><p>He suppressed his anger and said indifferently towards the direction of Langtian Domain, "You will follow me to Langtian Domain. If we cannot find the one who killed my Ling'er, I will slaughter all the people in Langtian Domain to accompany Ling'er."</p><p></p><p>The two inspectors inside and outside shrank their pupils, and one of them asked, "Lord Tianyuan, should we report this to the Division Master...?"</p><p></p><p>Zhao Tianyuan glared at him and said in a low voice, "Report to my father? He is currently handling important matters outside. At this time, do you want me to tell him that his granddaughter is dead? Besides, by the time he returns, I will have already avenged Ling'er!"</p><p></p><p>"This subordinate has spoken out of turn!" the inspector said in terror.</p><p></p><p>He didn't really want to say that, it's just that Zhao Tianyuan's threat to slaughter all the people in Langtian Domain was too frightening... They were all cultivators, but if it affected the mortals, that would be defying the Immortal Codes...</p><p></p><p>For the sake of that trash Zhao Ling, it's not worth it...</p><p></p><p>Of course, they didn't dare to say these thoughts out loud. There was also another thing he couldn't say, because Zhao Ling was personally dispatched by the Division Master...</p><p></p><p>"Hmph! Follow me! Let's go to Langtian Domain and find Ling'er's body first!"</p><p></p><p>Zhao Tianyuan said and then disappeared.</p>

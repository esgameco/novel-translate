        <h1>Chapter 204</h1>
        <div class="content">
            <p>Here is my translation of the Chinese excerpt:</p><p></p><p>After Peng Fang left, </p><p></p><p>Su Qianghe looked at the two jars of wine, licked his lips, and laughed excitedly, </p><p></p><p>"Haha, see, I guessed right, the Elder has hidden our share away!"</p><p></p><p>He continued laughing, "You three, shall we start drinking?"</p><p></p><p>At this time, Yin Jiuguai snatched one of the jars and hugged it to his chest, saying, "I want this one, you three can share the other one as compensation for me." </p><p></p><p>Without giving the bewildered three a chance to speak, he quickly disappeared to drink the wine somewhere.</p><p></p><p>"Hmph, this Fourth Elder, we were supposed to share one jar three ways, how could he be so greedy!" Su Qianghe's face showed some displeasure.</p><p></p><p>"Ah, Qianghe, forget it... we owe him." Left Qoushen quickly comforted.</p><p></p><p>Su Qianghe sighed, took the jar of wine and sat down, smiling, "Then shall we start drinking?"</p><p></p><p>...</p><p></p><p>The night passed into day.</p><p></p><p>The Xiaoyao Sect continued heading towards the central region.</p><p></p><p>Some attentive servant disciples noticed that since last night, the Grand Elder seemed to be in a bad mood, frowning the whole time.</p><p></p><p>Normally the Grand Elder was always smiling and amiable.</p><p></p><p>Seeing this, the others didn't dare to speak, silently advancing through the icy mist.</p><p></p><p>Left Qoushen's group behind Peng Fang also looked uneasy.</p><p></p><p>After all, the Grand Elder was the Grand Elder, they were really afraid he would mistreat them.</p><p></p><p>Su Qianghe planned to say something to ease the atmosphere,</p><p></p><p>but at this moment, </p><p></p><p>waves of battle fluctuations came from the depths of the icy mist, gradually approaching their Xiaoyao Sect.</p><p></p><p>The servant disciples and juniors also sensed it, their eyes flickering.</p><p></p><p>In no time, the ground was trembling.</p><p></p><p>Cries for help reached their ears,</p><p></p><p>"Fellow Daoists, it's the Ice Flame Tiger, our sect has suffered heavy casualties, we're the only ones left, please help, there will be a generous reward!!!"</p><p></p><p>The next moment, over a thousand figures rushed out from the icy mist, wearing the sect's uniform clothes, their faces filled with terror.</p><p></p><p>Behind them was an Ice Flame Tiger, relentlessly chasing them!</p><p></p><p>Unexpectedly, Peng Fang struck out with a palm!</p><p></p><p>Boom!!</p><p></p><p>The over a thousand cultivators hadn't even reacted before being blasted into a bloody mist by Peng Fang's palm strike.</p><p></p><p>The Ice Flame Tiger's eyes flashed with a bloody light, suddenly braking hard, trying to turn and flee.</p><p></p><p>"Hmph." Peng Fang coldly snorted, releasing his pressure, and directly exploded the Ice Flame Tiger.</p><p></p><p>Seeing this, everyone swallowed hard, no one said anything else.</p><p></p><p>Left Qoushen's group secretly coughed, knowing the Grand Elder was just venting his anger, those cultivators and the Ice Flame Tiger were just unlucky.</p><p></p><p>As for the new junior disciples, some felt pity, and some didn't understand - the just now thousand cultivators were clearly coming to seek help, yet the Grand Elder suddenly slapped them all to death.</p><p></p><p>"Misfortune attracts misfortune, they deserved their fate."</p><p></p><p>Peng Fang suddenly turned and looked at some disciples, saying.</p><p></p><p>The new junior disciples instantly stiffened, hurriedly bowing their heads, now understanding.</p><p></p><p>"Also, this Elder advises you, in this great competition, all sects are our opponents! Whether they are weak or strong, showing mercy to the enemy is cruelty to oneself!"</p><p></p><p>After saying this, he glanced displeasedly at Left Qoushen's group, then shook his sleeve and commanded, "Continue forward."</p><p></p><p>...</p><p></p><p>Time flew by, and two months had passed.</p><p></p><p>In these two months, many sects were destroyed, countless cultivators perished.</p><p></p><p>Whether it was due to the extremely harsh weather, battles between sects, or the ferocious beasts in the ice plains, etc.</p><p></p><p>"The final deadline is half a month, sects that fail to reach the central region will lose their qualification for the great competition, be informed..."Huh?</p><p></p><p>Here is the full English translation of the Chinese excerpt:</p><p></p><p>When the aged voice suddenly thundered from the heavens, the hearts of the various sects in the icy plains grew anxious.</p><p></p><p>Half a month?</p><p></p><p>Even now, the area was still shrouded in icy mist, how could they know how long it would take to reach the central region!</p><p></p><p>Immediately, they dared not rest any longer, rushing along frantically.</p><p></p><p>If they could obtain the rewards of a top-tier sect in this grand competition, that would be a glorious and prosperous future! </p><p></p><p>Elevating their sect's rank would no longer be just a dream.</p><p></p><p>But, what did the old man's final "Huh?" mean? Was it some kind of special hint?</p><p></p><p>The various sects were utterly perplexed.</p><p></p><p>Meanwhile, the scene shifted.</p><p></p><p>In the center of the frigid ice plains, within a magnificent palace, Lu Changsheng grasped an old man's neck, lifting him up with his toes barely touching the ground.</p><p></p><p>The old man's face was flushed red, his legs twitching, his aged eyes filled with a big question mark???</p><p></p><p>Although he was suffering, it did not hinder his bewilderment at the moment.</p><p></p><p>He had merely come to call out a few times to remind the sects in the icy plains of the time limit, </p><p></p><p>when suddenly this unfamiliar young man in blue robes appeared, grasping his throat and lifting him up high...</p><p></p><p>What was more terrifying was that he couldn't even resist if he tried!</p><p></p><p>No, what had he done wrong?</p><p></p><p>As far as he could remember, he hadn't offended such a powerful young man before.</p><p></p><p>Also, there didn't seem to be such a person in the human realm...</p><p></p><p>"You were disturbing my sleep," Lu Changsheng said to him indifferently.</p><p></p><p>The old man: "?"</p><p></p><p>The old man was at a loss for words, utterly confused.</p><p></p><p>Boom!</p><p></p><p>Lu Changsheng flung the old man to the ground, the old man letting out a cry of pain as he crashed down, his face swollen and bruised.</p><p></p><p>"Next time, keep your voice down. If I happen to be sleeping, well... hehe."</p><p></p><p>Lu Changsheng said indifferently, then turned and disappeared with a single step.</p><p></p><p>Only the bewildered old man was left behind.</p><p></p><p>"Elder Fu, what did your 'Huh?' just now mean? Was there something else you needed to tell the sects?" </p><p></p><p>At this moment, a middle-aged man with a fawning smile entered, but his expression changed as he saw the scene before him.</p><p></p><p>He quickly went to help the old man up from the ground, seeing the swelling on his face, his heart filled with alarm.</p><p></p><p>"Elder Fu... what happened to you?" The middle-aged man was clearly anxious and suspicious.</p><p></p><p>After all, Elder Fu was a revered elder of the top-tier Xuanhuo Sect, entrusted with overseeing the grand competition. </p><p></p><p>If something happened to him, who would bear the wrath of the Xuanhuo Sect?</p><p></p><p>"Cough." Elder Fu cleared his throat, slapping away the middle-aged man's hand and sternly saying, "What are you flustered about? This elder was merely cultivating, that's all!"</p><p></p><p>The middle-aged man let out a sigh of relief, cupping his hands and respectfully praising, "Elder Fu is truly a distinguished elder of the Xuanhuo Sect, to be cultivating so diligently. This humble one is truly ashamed."</p><p></p><p>Hearing this, Elder Fu's pent-up frustration and anger exploded towards the middle-aged man.</p><p></p><p>"What are you laughing about? Are you that free? There's less than half a month before the sects arrive! Hurry up and leave to prepare, you useless thing!"</p><p></p><p>The middle-aged man was sprayed with spittle, left dumbfounded on the spot.</p><p></p><p>What had he done wrong?</p>

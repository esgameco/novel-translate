        <h1>Chapter 482</h1>
        <div class="content">
            <p>Here is the full English translation of the excerpt from the Chinese novel:</p><p></p><p>The cultivators on the Sea Transport No. 3 were stunned.</p><p></p><p>Another robbery?</p><p></p><p>They had encountered sea demonic cultivators on the sea just two hundred years ago, and now that they were about to go ashore on Eternal Night Island, this was happening again?</p><p></p><p>The cultivators were not afraid, though. Even if these people were strong, could they be stronger than those sea demonic cultivators?</p><p></p><p>Even if they were more arrogant, could they be more arrogant than those sea demonic cultivators?</p><p></p><p>But the cultivators' expressions soon changed, for they sensed that among the hundreds of figures, there were quite a few powerful ones who had comprehended the Dao!</p><p></p><p>The cultivators suddenly remembered that they had already entered the Sea of Dao, and the native cultivators and other monsters living here were most likely beings who had comprehended the Dao as well!</p><p></p><p>Uh-oh, this is troublesome!</p><p></p><p>But wait, maybe not!</p><p></p><p>The cultivators suddenly saw Lu Changsheng's silhouette and felt relieved, then looked at the hundreds of figures on the shore with pity.</p><p></p><p>These guys are in trouble!</p><p></p><p>The hundreds of people on the shore noticed that the cultivators on the ship not only were not afraid of them, but even had a pitying expression on their faces...</p><p></p><p>They thought they might have seen it wrong. What's going on? Who's robbing whom?</p><p></p><p>"Didn't I tell you to get off the ship? Hurry up!" the middle-aged leader impatiently shouted.</p><p></p><p>This shore was just one of the many ports of entry to Eternal Night Island, and even after going ashore, they were still some distance away from the prosperous areas of Eternal Night Island. </p><p></p><p>These people were from a gang within Eternal Night Island. In the dangerous Sea of Dao, robbing the ships docking at Eternal Night Island was one of their means of survival.</p><p></p><p>"Boss, this seems to be a ship from the Sea Transport Guild. Should we still rob it?..." </p><p></p><p>Suddenly, one of the subordinates with sharp eyes spotted the insignia on the ship and his expression changed.</p><p></p><p>What? The Sea Transport Guild?</p><p></p><p>Hearing this, the hundreds of figures on the shore all had a change in their expressions, even the middle-aged leader frowned.</p><p></p><p>The Sea Transport Guild had branches throughout the Three Thousand Realms, and even had a presence in the Sea of Dao. This was a tough bone to chew...</p><p></p><p>Except for the sea demonic cultivators, hardly anyone dared to rob the Sea Transport Guild, unless they were confident.</p><p></p><p>Because in the Sea of Dao, many knew that the president of the Sea Transport Guild was one of the few who had comprehended the Profound Mysteries!</p><p></p><p>If they really robbed a ship of the Sea Transport Guild today, it would be fine if they could kill everyone on board and cover up the traces. But they were worried that something unexpected might happen, and if it reached the ears of the Sea Transport Guild, their Three Tigers Gang would be done for.</p><p></p><p>On the ship, the cultivators saw that the people on the shore seemed to be wary of them, and they felt slightly relieved, but they didn't know why these people were so cautious.</p><p></p><p>The captain and the crew members, on the other hand, had never frowned, because they knew that these people would not dare to make a move after realizing the ship belonged to the Sea Transport Guild.</p><p></p><p>These people were basically islanders of Eternal Night Island, with their roots here, unlike the sea demonic cultivators who had no fixed abode.</p><p></p><p>Sure enough, the next moment, the middle-aged leader changed his expression, cupped his hands towards the captain, and smiled sweetly:</p><p></p><p>"Hehe, so it's a ship from the Sea Transport Guild. Captain, it was a misunderstanding, a misunderstanding!"</p><p></p><p>The cultivators on the ship immediately felt relieved, and smiles reappeared on their faces.</p><p></p><p>The captain chuckled:</p><p></p><p>"No problem, the sky on Eternal Night Island is pitch-black, it's understandable that some people have poor eyesight. I can understand."</p><p></p><p>The middle-aged leader's expression changed slightly, but he still forced a smile: "Hehe, the captain is right. Captain, if you have time after docking, you're welcome to come to our Three Tigers Gang..."</p><p></p><p>Saying that, the middle-aged leader waved his hand with a gloomy face, "Retreat!"</p><p></p><p>The next moment, the hundreds of people disappeared from the shore, as if they had decided to leave decisively since the plan couldn't be carried out.</p><p></p><p>"Wow, Captain, I know your Sea Transport Guild is powerful, but I didn't expect these native people of the Sea of Dao to be so obsequious!" </p><p></p><p>One of the cultivators admired.</p><p></p><p>Immediately, the rest of the cultivators echoed in agreement.</p><p></p><p>But their eyes were gleaming, and they were puzzled. Was there something more formidable about the Sea Transport Guild that they didn't know? It's just a business guild, right?</p><p></p><p>Although it had branches in the Sea of Dao, it shouldn't make those ruthless people so wary, should it?</p><p></p><p>The captain chuckled, "Since you all have come to the Sea of Dao, you'll have the chance to know more about it in the future, so I might as well tell you today."</p><p></p><p>Saying that, the captain's face showed pride: "Our Sea Transport Guild's president is a great cultivator who has comprehended the Profound Mysteries. Even in the Sea of Dao, many people have to show respect to our Sea Transport Guild."</p><p></p><p>Here is the full English translation of the Chinese excerpt:</p><p></p><p>"Whoosh!"</p><p></p><p>A sharp hiss!</p><p></p><p>The crowd suddenly drew in a sharp breath!</p><p></p><p>Except for the two elves who remained calm and seemed to have already known.</p><p></p><p>Chen Pang and Xiao Chai both had expressions of shock on their faces!</p><p></p><p>Profound Technique!</p><p></p><p>The Dao was still somewhat distant from them, and even after comprehending the Dao, they would still need to continuously refine and familiarize themselves with it.</p><p></p><p>Not to mention the legendary Profound Technique.</p><p></p><p>The crowd now fully realized, no wonder the shipping routes and transport ships leading to the Sea of Dao were almost monopolized by the Maritime Trade Association.</p><p></p><p>It turns out that behind the Maritime Trade Association was a Profound Technique master of unparalleled power!</p><p></p><p>Thinking of this, the cultivators' gazes towards the captain and crew members also changed, becoming increasingly respectful.</p><p></p><p>Provoking them is absolutely not an option.</p><p></p><p>The captain just chuckled, feeling proud that the head of his association was so powerful. As a member of the association, he also felt a sense of glory.</p><p></p><p>Afterwards, the captain left two crew members to watch the ship, then beckoned to Lu Changsheng, and the group gradually disembarked and headed towards the island under the cover of night.</p><p></p><p>Soon, the shore became quiet, with only the sound of waves.</p><p></p><p>On the Maritime No. 3, the two crew members sat cross-legged on the deck, bored out of their minds.</p><p></p><p>"Sigh, I also want to go to the island and have some fun, it's so boring here."</p><p></p><p>"Enough with the complaining, just focus on your job. It's not easy to get a job as a crew member of the Maritime Trade Association."</p><p></p><p>"If it weren't for the great treatment from the Maritime Trade Association, I wouldn't be willing to be a crew member at all, it's too dangerous. You saw what happened with those demonic cultivators recently, if it weren't for that Azure-robed Gentleman, we would have been done for."</p><p></p><p>"......"</p><p></p><p>After an unknown amount of time,</p><p></p><p>"Who's there?!"</p><p></p><p>Suddenly, the two crew members jumped up, their eyes filled with vigilance as they scanned the surroundings of the port.</p><p></p><p>"Hehe hehe hehe..."</p><p></p><p>Soon, a group of figures slowly emerged from the darkness, and they were the same people from the Three Tigers Gang who had left earlier!</p><p></p><p>The hearts of the two crew members were immediately filled with a sense of foreboding, and one of them frowned and said:</p><p></p><p>"It's you? What do you want?"</p><p></p><p>The middle-aged man in the lead let out a cold smile, then waved his hand:</p><p></p><p>"Go, kill these two and quickly loot all the valuable treasures on the ship!"</p><p></p><p>"Yes, sir!"</p><p></p><p>The crowd responded, then approached the Maritime No. 3 with cruel expressions!</p><p></p><p>The two crew members saw this and their faces turned deathly pale, their steps involuntarily retreating.</p><p></p><p>"You... you dare to rob and attack us, the Maritime Trade Association?!"</p><p></p><p>"Hehe, who would know?"</p><p></p><p>...</p><p></p><p>At the same time, on the other side, Lu Changsheng and the others were still flying towards the depths of Eternal Night Island.</p><p></p><p>The cultivators were chatting in a low voice, trying not to disturb Lu Changsheng.</p><p></p><p>Suddenly, Lu Changsheng's figure paused, hovering in the air, and he turned his head to look towards the distant shore.</p><p></p><p>The others had been paying attention to Lu Changsheng to some extent, and seeing this, they also hurriedly stopped, although they didn't dare to ask what was wrong, their faces were full of confusion, not knowing what had happened.</p><p></p><p>The captain, looking at Lu Changsheng's expression and the direction he was looking, had a guess in his mind in just a moment. He also quickly looked in that direction, his pupils gradually contracting. Could it be...</p><p></p><p>"Your two crew members are in trouble," Lu Changsheng said calmly.</p><p></p><p>Hearing this, everyone was shocked!</p><p></p><p>The captain was so anxious that he was in a complete mess!</p><p></p><p>What should they do? They had already flown so far, there was no way they could get back in time!</p><p></p><p>Lu Changsheng looked deeply at the captain, and then in the depths of his eyes, a blue light flickered slightly as he said softly:</p><p></p><p>"Don't worry."</p><p></p><p>The captain and the others paused, not knowing what Lu Changsheng meant.</p><p></p><p>The scene shifted!</p><p></p><p>On the Maritime No. 3, it had fallen into absolute silence, only the faint sound of heavy breathing echoing.</p><p></p><p>The two crew members had collapsed on the deck, their faces filled with terror as they stared at the scene before them, their breathing extremely labored.</p><p></p><p>"What... what happened to them?"</p><p></p><p>Hundreds of Three Tigers Gang cultivators were suspended in the air in various poses, as if they had been petrified and unable to move.</p><p></p><p>Their faces still bore the original bloodthirsty and savage smiles, but their eyes had changed, trembling, revealing a sense of bewilderment, confusion, and fear!</p>

        <h1>Chapter 219</h1>
        <div class="content">
            <p>Here is the full English translation of the Chinese excerpt:</p><p></p><p>At these words, Peng Fang's brow suddenly furrowed. üéàüíõÔºñ‚ùæÔº≥ùì±·ëåùìß.ƒÜùï†Œúüíúüî•</p><p></p><p>The monk shadows gazing up at the azure sky all turned to look at his reaction.</p><p></p><p>"Ah, ah, ah, ah - Patriarch, save us!!!"</p><p></p><p>Just then, Zhong Wuyan's anguished cry for help suddenly rang out.</p><p></p><p>Hearing this, Lei Chengdong's gaze turned sharp.</p><p></p><p>If this continued, his three elders would soon be dead!!</p><p></p><p>He then gritted his teeth and shouted,</p><p></p><p>"Sect Master Wei! Please let our sect in! Haven't you always wanted our Great Sun Thunder Sect's Great Sun Control Thunder Scripture? Afterwards, our sect will be willing to let you observe it!!"</p><p></p><p>The elder shadow finally opened his eyes, and with a wave of his hand, completely dispelled the crimson glow of the first Purple Gold Space!!</p><p></p><p>And sent out all the elders of the Great Sun Thunder Sect!</p><p></p><p>Fifteen figures stood weakly before Lei Chengdong, some more injured than others, especially Zhong Wuyan and the other two, their bodies horrifying.</p><p></p><p>They used their last bit of strength to say one sentence before completely losing consciousness:</p><p></p><p>"Pa...Patriarch, we are powerless."</p><p></p><p>The surrounding elders hurriedly supported the unconscious Zhong Wuyan and the others, frantically using spirit medicines to repair their bodies on the verge of collapse.</p><p></p><p>Lei Cheng looked at the elders, his gaze unwilling and his heart extremely disappointed!</p><p></p><p>At this time, the azure sky elder shadow said indifferently,</p><p></p><p>"This Sect Master has sent them out, but as for the battle of the elder echelon, even if your Great Sun Thunder Sect loses... As for the Great Sun Control Thunder Scripture, remember to personally send it to my Sacred Spirit Palace afterwards."</p><p></p><p>Everyone was dumbfounded, how could this be? How was this any different from favoring the Great Sun Thunder Sect?</p><p></p><p>After all, once a battle beyond one's level began, it was a fight to the death!</p><p></p><p>Lei Chengdong took a deep breath, glaring coldly at Peng Fang and the others, then cupped his hands towards the elder and was about to turn back to his seat.</p><p></p><p>&lt;tt_keyword_ad data-title="Game" data-tag="Premium Recommendation" data-type="1" data-value="1913"&gt;&lt;/tt_keyword_ad&gt;</p><p></p><p>"Wait!"</p><p></p><p>Peng Fang suddenly frowned and said in a low voice.</p><p></p><p>Lei Chengdong's footsteps paused, and he slowly turned around, looking indifferently at Peng Fang.</p><p></p><p>At this moment, the battle between the executive guard layer and the disciple layer had finally completely stopped...</p><p></p><p>Tong Xin and Lin Dong, covered in blood, were panting heavily, forcibly swallowing the fresh blood in their throats!</p><p></p><p>They were all staring at the first Purple Gold Space now, feeling that the development of the situation was a bit off...</p><p></p><p>...</p><p></p><p>"This elder wants to ask, isn't a battle beyond one's level a fight to the death? Didn't you say that once the confrontation began, no one could interfere with the battle inside the Purple Gold Space?" </p><p></p><p>Peng Fang took a deep breath, staring intently at the elder shadow, suddenly pointing at the Great Sun Thunder Sect elders and exclaiming,</p><p></p><p>"So I ask, as the one presiding over the battle beyond one's level, what is the meaning of your interference!?"</p><p></p><p>Peng Fang's tone was sharp, voicing the thoughts of countless people.</p><p></p><p>But this action of his still made the crowd's souls tremble, did the Carefree Sect really want to die?</p><p></p><p>This elder shadow's true self... was the Sect Master of the Sacred Spirit Palace, after all.</p><p></p><p>To offend him, it could be said that there would be no way to survive in the entire Linglong Heavens.</p><p></p><p>Hearing this, the Carefree Sect's executive guards and disciples like Tong Xin finally understood what had happened!!</p><p></p><p>They looked in the direction Peng Fang was pointing, towards those battered elders of the Great Sun Thunder Sect...</p><p></p><p>It turned out that the elder shadow presiding over the battle beyond one's level had broken the rules!!</p><p></p><p>How... could this be...?!</p><p></p><p>Boundless fury instantly surged in their hearts!!</p><p></p><p>...</p><p></p><p>As for Peng Fang's questioning of the elder shadow,</p><p></p><p>Lei Chengdong was shocked, but inwardly he couldn't help but laugh.</p><p></p><p>How truly naive!</p><p></p><p>Here is the full English translation of the Chinese excerpt:</p><p></p><p>The vast, elderly figure in the sky was also slightly taken aback, not expecting someone to dare question him. He stared at Peng Fang, a hint of murderous intent flashing in his eyes, and said indifferently, "Does the Master of this Hall need to explain himself to an insignificant ant like you?"</p><p></p><p>Peng Fang's eyes flickered, suppressing his anger, and said, "If the Carefree Sect is defeated in the Purple Gold Realm, can they escape the fate of being annihilated like the Great Day Thunder Sect?"</p><p></p><p>The sky above the Sunset Thunder Forest fell into a deathly silence.</p><p></p><p>The development of the situation had suddenly taken this turn, which was something no one had anticipated.</p><p></p><p>No one had expected the Carefree Sect to be so strong!</p><p></p><p>And even more unexpected was that the Patriarch of the Holy Divine Hall, who was presiding over the cross-level battle, would openly show favoritism towards the Great Day Thunder Sect!</p><p></p><p>To be honest, they felt a bit unsavory about this.</p><p></p><p>The collusion of the first-rate sects had actually turned the much-anticipated cross-level battle into a mere child's play...!!</p><p></p><p>They hated it in their hearts, but they were powerless to do anything.</p><p></p><p>The only thing they could do... was to remain silent and feel pity.</p><p></p><p>At this moment, the elderly figure spoke faintly, "No."</p><p></p><p>Peng Fang looked up and stared at the elderly figure, coldly smiling, "This cross-level battle has drawn the attention of the entire Linglang Heavens. As the presider of the cross-level battle and the creator of the rules, you have blatantly broken the rules you set yourself... for the sake of your own desires, you have openly shown favoritism towards the Great Day Thunder Sect..."</p><p></p><p>Reaching this point, Peng Fang suddenly roared furiously, "You... are truly shameless!!"</p><p></p><p>Boom!!!</p><p></p><p>Hearing these words, the minds of the crowd were shaken!!! They stared at Peng Fang in disbelief!!!</p><p></p><p>Lei Cheng Dong, Lu Ye, Li Tai Ling, and the others all had their hearts pounding violently. They quickly looked up at the elderly figure above!!!</p><p></p><p>Sure enough, his expression had changed!!</p><p></p><p>The Patriarch of the Holy Divine Hall had never been cursed at before!!</p><p></p><p>"Hehe." The elderly figure suddenly laughed, then spoke in a deep voice, "In this Linglang Heavens, you are the first one who dares to curse at the Master of this Hall... Then let's end this cross-level battle here..."</p><p></p><p>"Today, I will let the world know... As the strongest, I can create the rules, and of course, I can also break the rules!!"</p><p></p><p>"I'd like to see who dares to defy the words of the Master of this Hall???"</p><p></p><p>The crowd fell silent, all lowering their heads, not daring to make eye contact with him.</p><p></p><p>"Not only will I destroy the Great Day Thunder Sect, but I will also destroy all of you today!" The elderly figure said coldly.</p><p></p><p>On the other side, Lei Yu's eyes trembled. He looked at Lei Cheng Dong, then at the elderly figure, his heart filled with a sense of oppression.</p><p></p><p>This was not what he wanted to see. Why...?</p><p></p><p>Just then, a thunderous sound rang out, and the pressure from the elderly figure suddenly descended from the sky, heavily pressing down on the Carefree Sect members!!!</p><p></p><p>Their faces turned deathly pale!! Dizzy and disoriented!!</p><p></p><p>An intense sense of resentment erupted in their hearts like a volcanic eruption!!!</p><p></p><p>Their eyes turned bloodshot!!</p><p></p><p>"Admit your mistake, and perhaps the Master of this Hall can let you die a little more comfortably," the elderly figure said, controlling the intensity of the pressure.</p><p></p><p>Su Qiang could no longer hold back, raising his head and roaring furiously, "You son of a bitch!!!"</p><p></p><p>"It's best not to drag this out until our Carefree Sect Master arrives... Otherwise, all of you will die!!!"</p><p></p><p>The entire place fell silent!!</p><p></p><p>At this moment, Zhao Ran suddenly noticed the movement of the figure in blue beside her!!</p><p></p><p>"Senior..."</p><p></p><p>She looked at the figure stepping into the center, her pupils suddenly contracting!!</p><p></p><p>In this silent, petrified scene, the movement of the figure in blue instantly drew the attention of everyone present!</p><p></p><p>They were bewildered...</p><p></p><p>Lei Yu, Lei Ting, and the others suddenly looked towards the figure in blue, shocked for a moment, then their minds were shaken, and their pupils began to tremble violently!!!</p><p></p><p>They recalled the bits and pieces, the connections, and their scalps instantly went numb!!!</p><p></p><p>Could it be...?</p><p></p><p>Until a bitter cry from the Carefree Sect members echoed through the air...</p>

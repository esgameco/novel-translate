        <h1>Chapter 168</h1>
        <div class="content">
            <p>Here is the full English translation of the Chinese excerpt:</p><p></p><p>Outside of Qingxuan Town,</p><p></p><p>Left You fled frantically. He was drenched in sweat, his face deathly pale. ‚ò∫üíô‚ûÖÔºôsùìóœÖÔº∏.ÔΩÉœÉùì∂üçÆüç™</p><p></p><p>As soon as he ran out of Qingxuan Town, he heard the startling sound of a sword's cry, and then saw two severed heads flying through the air, hanging above the town gate.</p><p></p><p>And those two heads... were the two elders of the Jiang Imperial Clan!</p><p></p><p>Immediately afterwards, a mysterious giant face formed from mist appeared in the sky, and a palm strike descended from the heavens. Under the terrifying giant palm, Left You felt like he was about to suffocate.</p><p></p><p>Even more terrifying was that the giant palm and face were suddenly dispersed by a mysterious force!</p><p></p><p>Even now, Left You could not believe that the bartender named Lu Changsheng was so powerful!!!</p><p></p><p>He sped up, wanting only to flee.</p><p></p><p>Left You did not know why his foster father had enmity with the Jiang Imperial Clan, nor did he want to know. He only knew that in the crisis of the Tian She Manor, his desertion would definitely not be forgiven by his foster father!!</p><p></p><p>As Left You was lost in his thoughts, a figure appeared in front of him, blocking his path.</p><p></p><p>Left You's pupils shrank, and he abruptly stopped. He looked at the newcomer and forced a smile, saying, "Grand Elder."</p><p></p><p>The Grand Elder looked at Left You for a moment, then pursed his lips and said, "Young Master, where are you going?"</p><p></p><p>Seeing the Grand Elder's indifferent expression, Left You trembled inwardly, and suddenly knelt down, pleading, "Grand Elder, Left You knows he was wrong. I beg you, for the sake of our past relationship, to spare my life!"</p><p></p><p>The Grand Elder shook his head and said, "Young Master, the Tian She Manor has raised you for many years, and the Manor Lord has treated you as his own... Yet in the Manor's time of crisis, you have deserted. This is truly heartbreaking."</p><p></p><p>"Left You was wrong!!" Left You kowtowed frantically, his sweat pouring down.</p><p></p><p>"If the Manor Lord was not currently occupied with important matters and could not come himself, he would have personally come to execute you today."</p><p></p><p>The Grand Elder said indifferently, without the slightest change in expression.</p><p></p><p>Before Left You could continue begging, a black snake suddenly shot out from the Grand Elder's sleeve, lunging towards Left You!</p><p></p><p>"Grand Elder, spare me...!!" </p><p></p><p>Left You was horrified, and before he could react, the enlarged black snake swallowed him whole.</p><p></p><p>The Grand Elder made a gesture, and the black snake shrank back into his sleeve.</p><p></p><p>"Spare you? Wishful thinking."</p><p></p><p>...</p><p></p><p>The events that occurred in Qingxuan Town spread like a plague in all directions over the next period of time.</p><p></p><p>Chaotic news shook the Black Abyss Domain.</p><p></p><p>The Lord and Vice-Lord of the Celestial Palace in Dry-Void City, Kunlun Yu and his deputy, were killed in Qingxuan Town.</p><p></p><p>Two second-stage Immortal Emperors of the Jiang Imperial Clan were killed in Qingxuan Town, their severed heads hung high on the town gate.</p><p></p><p>Even a mysterious powerful expert of the Jiang Imperial Clan struck from an extremely distant place, but their fierce attack was forcefully dispersed and driven back.</p><p></p><p>The one who caused this major incident was not a group, but only a single person.</p><p></p><p>Lu Changsheng, this unfamiliar name.</p><p></p><p>Many people inquired extensively, only to learn that he was the bartender of a small tavern that had suddenly appeared in Qingxuan Town.</p><p></p><p>As for why the Jiang Imperial Clan had a conflict with the Changsheng Tavern, it was said that the Jiang Imperial Clan had killed the customers waiting in line at the tavern, which provoked the hidden bartender Lu Changsheng to step out and suppress them.</p><p></p><p>This event greatly shocked countless people, who directly stated that the waters of the Black Abyss Domain were too deep, and that a mere bartender of a small tavern could be so terrifying.</p><p></p><p>"This matter has truly caused a huge uproar. I am willing to call that tavern bartender the most ruthless and ferocious person in the Black Abyss Domain! He actually dared to single-handedly confront the Imperial Clan," they sighed in amazement.</p><p></p><p>"Yes, even more ruthless is that the bartender hung the severed heads of the two Immortal Emperors of the Jiang Imperial Clan on the town gate for all to see. This is not just ruthless, but truly shocking!"</p><p></p><p>Here is the full English translation of the Chinese excerpt:</p><p></p><p>"What is 'slapping someone's face hard'? Who dares to do that? That's too arrogant."</p><p></p><p>"I'm curious, what is the Jiang clan imperial family going to do in Qingxuan Town? I heard that the Gongzhu and Vice Gongzhu of the Tianshe Palace in Gangyou City were killed by them."</p><p></p><p>"The purpose of the Jiang clan imperial family is not very clear, but I guess they might be going to the Longevity Wine Hall to drink the Xishen Liquor. They might have to wait in line, and then impatiently kill the people in line. You should know that for people of their strength and status, killing us like ants is just normal for them."</p><p></p><p>"But speaking of that, you don't know, I heard that the Xishen Liquor is a rare and exquisite wine. Those who have drunk it are all obsessed with it."</p><p></p><p>"Is that true? Is it really that good to drink?"</p><p></p><p>"......"</p><p></p><p>Countless rumors were spreading in the towns of the Heisha Domain, an unprecedented excitement and liveliness.</p><p></p><p>Who wouldn't love to watch such a good show?</p><p></p><p>At the same time,</p><p></p><p>the Tianshe Palace in Gangyou City was in a state of deathly silence and depression.</p><p></p><p>They never imagined that their Xian Emperor-level Gongzhu and NineÂìÅ Xian Lord-level Vice Gongzhu could drink themselves to death.</p><p></p><p>The elders didn't know what had happened, including the details of the copper mirror search, they only knew that the Vice Gongzhu had distributed nine copper mirrors to them, asking them to search in the nearby towns, without saying anything else or allowing them to ask.</p><p></p><p>Just as they were still searching, they heard this terrible news, at first they didn't dare to believe it was true, even until now they are still a bit dazed.</p><p></p><p>"From now on, I, the Elder, will temporarily take over the position of Gongzhu!" The Great Elder of the Tianshe Palace stepped forward, his eyes flashing with brilliance.</p><p></p><p>The other elders were immediately agitated, some dissatisfied.</p><p></p><p>The Great Elder said in a stern voice: "Elders, don't worry, the Gongzhu and Vice Gongzhu didn't die for nothing. That Longevity Wine Hall's boss, we have nothing to fear!"</p><p></p><p>"He has opposed the Jiang clan imperial family, in the end he will only have one path - death!"</p><p></p><p>"Before that, we can't just sit idle, we need to report this matter to the Domain Lord, the Domain Lord will definitely help us."</p><p></p><p>"Our Tianshe Palace must strike back, otherwise in this Heisha Domain, in this Gangyou City, we won't be able to survive."</p><p></p><p>...</p><p></p><p>These days, Qingxuan Town was overcrowded, the streets were packed.</p><p></p><p>There were many cultivators from other towns who came to watch the excitement.</p><p></p><p>At this moment, there were still many cultivators outside the town, their eyes all fixed on the two heads hanging above the town gate.</p><p></p><p>The two heads had their mouths slightly open, maintaining an expression of terror.</p><p></p><p>These were two Second Transformation Xian Emperors from the Jiang clan imperial family!</p><p></p><p>The longer the heads hung there, the more humiliating it became.</p><p></p><p>Thinking of this, the hearts of the crowd were shaken, and they couldn't help but think of the Longevity Wine Hall in the town.</p><p></p><p>The boss of that wine hall was the ruthless person who had hung those two heads there. He was also the central figure of the impending storm!</p><p></p><p>And at this time,</p><p></p><p>in the Longevity Wine Hall.</p><p></p><p>A group of cultivators were sitting obediently in their seats, drinking, their faces docile, not daring to say a word.</p><p></p><p>There was no way, truly no way, the young man in the rocking chair was exuding an overwhelming pressure.</p><p></p><p>Tongxin and Lin Dong were standing beside them, wearing professional smiles.</p><p></p><p>As for the registration line, which was originally handled by Lin Dong, it was enthusiastically taken over by the left-handed Chou Shan at the gate, saying that he alone was enough to handle the door and registration...</p><p></p><p>Lucheng suddenly opened his eyes, looking at the crowd and smiling lightly:</p><p></p><p>"Since you've come to my place to drink, just drink freely, do you think I'll eat you?"</p>

        <h1>Chapter 169</h1>
        <div class="content">
            <p>Here is my translation of the Chinese excerpt you provided:</p><p></p><p>Hearing Lu Changsheng suddenly speak, the people in the tavern were startled and quickly stood up, bowing respectfully with uneasy expressions.</p><p></p><p>"Master, the proprietor." </p><p></p><p>Seeing this, Lu Changsheng smiled: "What, do you think I'm going to eat you all?"</p><p></p><p>Upon hearing this, the crowd all shook their heads vigorously, like shaking a rattle drum.</p><p></p><p>"Ah."</p><p></p><p>Lu Changsheng sighed lightly, shaking his head helplessly, and walked towards the inner room.</p><p></p><p>The crowd immediately relaxed, quickly sitting back down. After downing a mouthful of soul-washing liquor, their faces gradually eased.</p><p></p><p>Tong Xin and Lin Dong secretly chuckled. They were more familiar with Lu Changsheng and knew he was a peaceful person, so as long as they did their duty, they would not be overly constrained, as that would make the master uncomfortable. </p><p></p><p>As for these customers, they were not very familiar with the master, especially after witnessing his awe-inspiring power that day, so their reverence for him was understandable. This sentiment would take some time to ease.</p><p></p><p>"Esteemed guests, our Changsheng Tavern is the same as other taverns. Since you are drinking, you should relax and drink freely. Being overly constrained is not what the master...the proprietor likes," Tong Xin said with a smile.</p><p></p><p>Hearing this, the crowd recalled Lu Changsheng's previous reaction and felt that this was indeed the case. They then tentatively began to clink cups, and soon became immersed in the soul-washing liquor, the atmosphere finally improving.</p><p></p><p>Tong Xin and Lin Dong exchanged a smile.</p><p></p><p>Here is the full English translation of the Chinese excerpt:</p><p></p><p>The silhouette of the curtain rose, and the domain officials in the hall bowed their bodies.</p><p></p><p>"Lu Changsheng..."</p><p></p><p>Xing Tian's eyes flickered, and the next moment he vanished from the hall.</p><p></p><p>"From today on, anyone who comes to find the domain master, say that he is not here!"</p><p></p><p>"Yes!"</p><p></p><p>The Holy Immortal Domain is located south of the Scar of the Sky, more than a hundred times larger than the Black Abyss Domain!</p><p></p><p>The Holy Immortal Domain is recognized as the largest domain in the entire Scar of the Sky, because there are three great imperial clans entrenched within it.</p><p></p><p>The three great imperial clans have a long history and rule over all things in the Scar of the Sky.</p><p></p><p>The Jiang Clan's imperial clan is located in the central region of the Holy Immortal Domain, occupying an extremely vast area, no less than tens of thousands of miles.</p><p></p><p>At this time, within the Jiang Clan's imperial clan,</p><p></p><p>Just as Jiang Wuji was summoning the clan's upper echelons to hold a meeting, an old man in white robes and a stunningly beautiful woman arrived.</p><p></p><p>The Jiang Clan's upper echelons were slightly taken aback, all rising from their seats.</p><p></p><p>Jiang Wuji furrowed his brows and slowly stood up, saying, "Old Man Zhan, what wind has blown you to my Jiang Clan today?"</p><p></p><p>Zhan Xingmang chuckled, his aged body surprisingly upright.</p><p></p><p>The woman beside him supported his wrist as they entered the hall.</p><p></p><p>"I, the clan leader, have heard that you, Jiang Wuji, suffered a setback in the Black Abyss Domain east of the Scar of the Sky, so I've come to check on you..."</p><p></p><p>Zhan Xingmang sat down in a seat casually, chuckling mysteriously.</p><p></p><p>The woman stood silently behind him, but upon hearing that Jiang Wuji had suffered a setback in the Black Abyss Domain, a trace of surprise flashed in her eyes.</p><p></p><p>The hall fell silent for a moment.</p><p></p><p>The faces of the upper echelons were slightly stiff and unnatural.</p><p></p><p>Jiang Wuji said in a cold voice, "This news should have taken some time to spread to the Holy Immortal Domain, Old Man Zhan. You, the clan leader of the Zhan Clan, truly have an iron grip on information."</p><p></p><p>Zhan Xingmang nodded slightly, neither confirming nor denying.</p><p></p><p>Seeing this, Jiang Wuji was extremely angry, and his killing intent towards that Lu Changsheng grew even stronger. He then said in a deep voice, "Old Man Zhan, if you've come here to mock me, then your purpose has been achieved. There's nothing else, so please leave. I, the clan leader, won't see you off."</p><p></p><p>"Hmph," Zhan Xingmang waved his hand slightly and smiled, "Old Jiang, you've misunderstood. With our close relationship, how could I possibly mock you? The reason I've come today is that I have a doubt - what were your two second-stage Immortal Emperors, Jiang Chu and Jiang Chong, doing in that Black Abyss Domain?"</p><p></p><p>As these words fell, including Jiang Wuji, everyone in the hall tensed up.</p><p></p><p>Jiang Wuji maintained his composure and coldly chuckled, "Haha, your Zhan Clan's information is so good, yet you don't even know this?"</p><p></p><p>Zhan Xingmang simply looked at him, not speaking.</p><p></p><p>Jiang Wuji paused, then pursed his lips and said, "I'll tell you, then you can leave. My clan still has a meeting to hold."</p><p></p><p>He then continued,</p><p></p><p>"Jiang Chu and Jiang Chong, I don't know where they heard that the Longevity Wine Hall in Qingxuan Town of the Black Abyss Domain has a peerless vintage. They are both obsessed with alcohol, so they sneaked off there. Who would have thought that such an incident would happen?"</p><p></p><p>Obtaining the 'answer', Zhan Xingmang no longer spoke further, smiling as he stood up, supported by the woman beside him, and left the hall, only a faint smile lingering.</p><p></p><p>"Old Jiang, then I'll take my leave. I'll come visit again next time."</p><p></p><p>"Hmph." Jiang Wuji angrily waved his sleeve, his expression somewhat unsightly, and he growled, "Everyone, sit down. Let's start the meeting!"</p><p></p><p>The upper echelons were startled, inwardly helpless. Clan leader, your anger is actually directed at the Zhan Clan leader. What's the use of venting it on them...</p><p></p><p>At the same time,</p><p></p><p>In the distant Qingxuan Town.</p><p></p><p>A man in black armor appeared out of thin air.</p><p></p><p>Xing Tian looked at the multitude of figures outside the town, then casually glanced at the two severed heads on the town gate, before striding towards the center of the town.</p><p></p><p>"Lu Changsheng..."</p>

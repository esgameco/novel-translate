        <h1>Chapter 390</h1>
        <div class="content">
            <p>Here is the full English translation of the Chinese excerpt:</p><p></p><p>Ao Zhen Tian's gaze flashed lightly, without any surprise.</p><p></p><p>Ao Xing and the other high-ranking members all secretly let out a sigh of relief. The fact that the Devour Beast Clan had invited the Clan Leader at this time could only mean one thing.</p><p></p><p>Everyone's thoughts were the same - they did not want the Heavenly Divine Master to successfully break through to the Divine Realm!</p><p></p><p>Ao Xing looked at Ao Zhen Tian in the main hall, "Clan Leader, you..."</p><p></p><p>Ao Zhen Tian waved his hand, and his figure disappeared with a dragon's roar: "This Clan Leader is going to the Devour Beast Clan."</p><p></p><p>...</p><p></p><p>The ten peak great clans were all located in the middle position of the Divine-Demonic Battlefield, so the distance between them was not too far, even when traveling at full speed.</p><p></p><p>The Devour Beast Clan was situated in a vast, endless dark ravine.</p><p></p><p>Amidst the shroud of war surrounding the Devour Beast Clan, one could vaguely see the shadows of many gigantic mutant beasts slowly swimming with their long tails.</p><p></p><p>These mutant beasts were all Devour Beasts, just like the patrol guards in the human territories, vigilantly guarding the surroundings.</p><p></p><p>At the same time, eight figures almost simultaneously appeared outside the Devour Beast Clan's territory - they were the eight Clan Leaders.</p><p></p><p>"Hehe, it seems that you Clan Leaders have also received the invitation from the Devour Beast Clan," Ao Zhen Tian smiled and cupped his hands towards the others, though his heart knew the reason.</p><p></p><p>"Sigh, we all know the truth. As the Heavenly Divine Master is so unparalleled, if he succeeds in becoming a Divine, we will have no retreat in the future," the Clan Leader of the Griffon Clan, ranked eighth, said helplessly.</p><p></p><p>"Haha, let's see what Clan Leader Bi has to say. As for the Heavenly Divine Master... it's up to you, the top five great clans, to make the decision," the elderly Clan Leader of the Water Demon Clan said with a sinister smile.</p><p></p><p>Hearing this, the Clan Leaders of the Xuanwu Clan (fifth rank), the Devour Soul Clan (sixth rank), and the Tian Ya Clan (ninth rank) all frowned slightly but did not refute.</p><p></p><p>Indeed, among the ten peak great clans, only the Xuanwu Clan was slightly better, while the remaining four clans were significantly weaker compared to the top five.</p><p></p><p>"Hehe, fellow Clan Leaders, let's enter the Devour Beast Clan first and hear what Clan Leader Bi has to say," Ao Zhen Tian smiled slightly and took the lead in entering the Devour Beast Clan.</p><p></p><p>The other seven Clan Leaders also stopped chatting and followed him in, and the vigilant Devour Beasts did not dare to obstruct them, as they had already received the notice from above about the arrival of these great clan leaders.</p><p></p><p>...</p><p></p><p>In a mountain ravine within the Devour Beast Clan.</p><p></p><p>The nine Clan Leaders gathered.</p><p></p><p>After a moment of silence, Bi You, the Clan Leader of the Devour Beast Clan, spoke first:</p><p></p><p>"Regarding the matter of the Heavenly Divine Master wishing to break through to the Divine Realm, what do you Clan Leaders think?"</p><p></p><p>Hearing this, the Clan Leaders exchanged glances. Ao Zhen Tian looked at Bi You and said directly, "Clan Leader Bi, since you have invited us here, I presume you must have some ideas?"</p><p></p><p>"Hehe." Bi You looked at Ao Zhen Tian and then said coldly, "I'm sure you Clan Leaders all understand that if we let the Divine Hawk succeed in breaking through to the Divine Realm, he will then control the entire Divine-Demonic Battlefield, and no one will be able to resist him!"</p><p></p><p>The Clan Leaders heard this and nodded silently, as if they had imagined that terrifying scenario, their pupils even contracting slightly.</p><p></p><p>They were the Clan Leaders of the top ten peak great clans, and which of them was not a proud person? How could they bear to be under someone else's rule?</p><p></p><p>Moreover, the Heavenly Divine Master, Divine Hawk, was already a formidable figure. If he succeeded in breaking through to the Divine Realm, their entire race would have no good days ahead.</p><p></p><p>"Hehe, Clan Leader Bi, just state your plan directly. We all have clear minds, and there's no need to beat around the bush, especially since it concerns the interests of all of us. At this moment, we are a community."</p><p></p><p>"Correct."</p><p>"..."</p><p></p><p>Bi You nodded slightly, looking at Ao Zhen Tian. "Dragon Clan Leader, what do you think?"</p><p></p><p>Hearing this, the Clan Leaders all looked at Ao Zhen Tian, eager to know his opinion, as Bi You had specifically asked him.</p><p></p><p>Here is the full English translation of the Chinese excerpt:</p><p></p><p>Unexpectedly.</p><p></p><p>After all, the Dragon Clan was already a rather special clan among the top ten clans, and could be said to be quite powerful.</p><p></p><p>Especially the clan leader Ao Zhengtian, who was a figure that could even wrestle with the Heavenly Deities.</p><p></p><p>Ao Zhengtian smiled and said, "The Dragon Clan naturally stands in the same camp as all of you, so Bi You Clan Leader can just speak directly."</p><p></p><p>"Good!"</p><p></p><p>Bi You's gaze turned fierce as he let out a low roar, "There's no time to waste, let's act now!!"</p><p></p><p>The clan leaders, including Ao Zhengtian, were slightly shocked in their hearts!</p><p></p><p>They suddenly understood why Bi You did not send a message, but directly invited them, the major clan leaders, over.</p><p></p><p>It turned out that the meaning was to act directly after reaching an agreement!</p><p></p><p>"Bi You Clan Leader, do we really not need to prepare at all? Just the nine of us going?" a clan leader asked hesitantly.</p><p></p><p>The other clan leaders also fell into contemplation upon hearing this.</p><p></p><p>Although the nine of them were already at the peak of the Divine-Demonic Battlefield, this was still the Heavenly Deity Clan after all!</p><p></p><p>How could it be so easy to break into the Heavenly Deity Clan? They didn't believe that the old fox Shen Ting hadn't made any preparations before his seclusion.</p><p></p><p>Bi You took a light breath and said in a firm voice, "Mm, no need to prepare anymore, preparation would also take time, and I, the Clan Leader, am afraid that if we delay any further, Shen Ting will break through the Divine Realm."</p><p></p><p>"Then what about the Human Clan? Our Sacred Sons and Daughters are still there..." the Fire Phoenix Clan Leader said.</p><p></p><p>"Fire Phoenix Clan Leader need not worry, the Human Clan dares not do anything to them." Bi You said in a deep voice, "The top priority now is to disrupt Shen Ting's breakthrough."</p><p></p><p>The Fire Phoenix Clan Leader and the others rolled their eyes, of course Bi You and the Dragon Clan's Ao Xing would say that!!</p><p></p><p>"Since it's already decided, let's not dally any further and head to the Heavenly Deity Clan immediately."</p><p></p><p>Ao Zhengtian said in a deep voice.</p><p></p><p>The clan leaders exchanged glances and then disappeared from the spot, heading towards the Heavenly Deity Clan together!</p><p></p><p>.........</p><p></p><p>The Spiritual Realm.</p><p></p><p>Lu Changsheng and Hunhui appeared on the shore of the Reincarnation Lake in the Human Souls Realm.</p><p></p><p>The surrounding soul bodies seemed to sense a great terror and scattered, continuing to wander calmly towards the depths.</p><p></p><p>On the other side, the group of soul servants led by the old butler were startled at the sight!</p><p></p><p>The old butler then quickly led the soul servants over and paid their respects.</p><p></p><p>The old butler first bowed to the master Hunhui, and then looked at Lu Changsheng with delight, "Sir... it's been a long time since you've come to the Spiritual Realm!"</p><p></p><p>The soul servants also looked at Lu Changsheng with great respect, knowing that even the Soul Emperor himself was polite to this young man.</p><p></p><p>And he was the only living person who could come and go freely in their Spiritual Realm!!</p><p></p><p>Lu Changsheng raised an eyebrow, "Hoping for my death?"</p><p></p><p>The old butler's body stiffened, and he said awkwardly, "Sir, you're joking, hehe."</p><p></p><p>Lu Changsheng smiled and then looked at the Reincarnation Lake, saying indifferently, "Hunhui, are you planning to imprison the Reincarnation Demon Child in the Reincarnation Lake?"</p><p></p><p>Hunhui nodded, looking at the Reincarnation Lake that was emitting a green glow, "The Immortal Emperor Changsheng is correct, the Reincarnation Lake has a natural imprisoning formation, which is the most suitable place to suppress it."</p><p></p><p>The old butler and the soul servants nearby were dumbfounded.</p><p></p><p>What's this Reincarnation Demon Child? Suppressing? They didn't understand.</p><p></p><p>But they also vaguely knew the intentions of Lu Changsheng and Hunhui.</p><p></p><p>Hunhui took a light breath and solemnly commanded, "By the order of this Emperor, the Heavenly Dipper Seventy-Two Calamities, the Earthly Dipper Thirty-Six Evils, and the Four Great Spiritual Generals of the Soul Emperor's Palace, gather at the Reincarnation Lake!!"</p><p></p><p>After saying that, he looked at the old butler and the soul servants, instructing, "Temporarily evacuate the soul bodies from the shore of the Reincarnation Lake."</p><p></p><p>"Yes!!" The old butler immediately led the soul servants to evacuate the soul bodies.</p>

        <h1>Chapter 257</h1>
        <div class="content">
            <p>Here is the full English translation of the Chinese excerpt:</p><p></p><p>Yang Qiu nodded in agreement, then bowed slightly and sighed:</p><p></p><p>"Although Yang Qiu is not a Buddhist cultivator, he has great respect for Master Mirror Observation. Master Mirror Observation is... a good person." üêºüíö6‚ûà·îïùêáùï¶ùìß.ùïîœÉùêåüç´üò≤</p><p></p><p>The three elders behind him also nodded slightly, with an expression of contemplation.</p><p></p><p>Indeed, among the peak experts in the Ancestral Heavenly Realm, Master Mirror Observation was the most gentle and amiable.</p><p></p><p>Among many mortals, he had an excellent reputation.</p><p></p><p>It was unexpected that such a virtuous monk would suddenly pass away.</p><p></p><p>Lu Changsheng nodded slightly, then turned and continued walking up the mountain.</p><p></p><p>The old turtle and the others glanced at Yang Qiu's group, then silently followed.</p><p></p><p>Seeing this, Yang Qiu hurriedly led his elders to catch up with Lu Changsheng, gently squeezing the bewildered old turtle and the others to the side, and carefully asked, </p><p></p><p>"Mr. Lu, may Yang Qiu follow you this time?"</p><p></p><p>Yang Qiu had a little scheme in his heart - Mr. Lu rarely went out, and this was a rare opportunity to get close to him. He must seize it!</p><p></p><p>"As you wish," Lu Changsheng said softly.</p><p></p><p>"Yes!" Yang Qiu was delighted, unaware that the old turtle and the others were looking at them with unfriendly eyes.</p><p></p><p>"Hey, you brat, do you know any manners?" the old turtle finally couldn't help but speak up.</p><p></p><p>Yang Qiu was startled, and only then did he turn his gaze to the old turtle and the others, his pupils constricting after a careful observation.</p><p></p><p>Powerful experts!</p><p></p><p>This hunchbacked old man was probably close to the Immortal Ancestor realm, and the other four were at least Transcendent Emperor realm.</p><p></p><p>Yang Qiu realized that these people must be Lu Changsheng's companions.</p><p></p><p>He didn't say anything else, just gave an embarrassed smile and stepped back, making way for them.</p><p></p><p>"Hmph, that's better," the old turtle grunted, not saying anything further.</p><p></p><p>Thereafter, the group walked in silence in the falling snow, getting closer and closer to the Heavenly Sound Temple on the mountain peak.</p><p></p><p>...</p><p></p><p>At the same time, in the spacious Heavenly Sound Temple venue, there was a sea of people. </p><p></p><p>Many peak power figures had already arrived and were seated in the front rows of the venue. </p><p></p><p>Some monks were walking among them, greeting and welcoming them.</p><p></p><p>Looking around, there were twelve figures in golden robes - they were the Divine Monarchs from the various Divine Monarch Pavilions across the divine realms, with Ye Wutian among them!</p><p></p><p>Ye Wutian was sitting there, chatting casually with the Divine Monarchs beside him, while his sword servant Lin Chuan stood silently behind him.</p><p></p><p>"Haha, Divine Monarch Ye, I heard your Divine Monarch Pavilion was completely destroyed a few years ago. I wonder if the culprit has been found yet?" a Divine Monarch who had a poor relationship with Ye Wutian teased.</p><p></p><p>The other Divine Monarchs fell silent, looking at Ye Wutian curiously.</p><p></p><p>Seeing this, Ye Wutian's face stiffened slightly, while Lin Chuan remained calm and composed.</p><p></p><p>"Haha, you don't need to worry about that," Ye Wutian said coldly, closing his eyes and refusing to say more.</p><p></p><p>But his eyelid was twitching, showing he was quite angry. </p><p></p><p>The attack on his Divine Monarch Pavilion had made him a laughingstock. </p><p></p><p>Fortunately, the repairs were done quickly, and not too many people knew about it.</p><p></p><p>"Oh yes, Divine Monarch Ye, it's been so many years, but you still haven't caught those few ants in the Four Directions Immortal Realm, huh... Tsk tsk, your efficiency is really lacking," the Divine Monarch continued to taunt.</p><p></p><p>Ye Wutian slowly opened his eyes and stared at him coldly, "Guan Ning, it seems you're quite concerned about my affairs?"</p><p></p><p>Guan Ning's lips curled into a faint smile as he replied lightly, "We've already taken care of everything that needed to be dealt with. But your Heavenly Saint Divine Realm...</p><p></p><p>Here is the full English translation of the Chinese excerpt:</p><p></p><p>"Slowly, the divine paths of the four cardinal immortal realms are right here in your Heavenly Saint State, yet you can't even catch a few ants for all this time!" </p><p></p><p>"If they reach the Divine Emperor's Palace, you Ye Wutian and Fei He will be the criminals!"</p><p></p><p>Fei He was another Godking of the Heavenly Saint State.</p><p></p><p>Boom!</p><p></p><p>Ye Wutian and Fei He's expressions changed slightly as they abruptly stood up, glaring at Guan Ning unfriendly, "Godking Guan Ning, is your Heavenly Flame State looking to start a war?"</p><p></p><p>Guan Ning was unafraid, and slowly stood up beside another Godking, facing off against Ye Wutian and the others.</p><p></p><p>The other Godkings were unfazed, as nowadays each of the six great states had two Godkings.</p><p></p><p>And the Heavenly Saint State and Heavenly Flame State had always been at odds.</p><p></p><p>"Start a war? Ye Wutian, how dare you brazenly escalate this to the state level. Are you not afraid of the Divine Emperor's words? Then fight my state!" Guan Ning's fists clenched slowly.</p><p></p><p>Ye Wutian let out a cold laugh, and his aura suddenly surged!</p><p></p><p>Seeing this, Guan Ning also met the aura with his own!</p><p></p><p>Boom!</p><p></p><p>In an instant, countless tables and chairs were shattered, and a storm was whipped up in the venue. The top echelons of the various powerful factions all had their gazes fixed intently on the scene.</p><p></p><p>However, they were just watching solemnly - they may be top powers themselves, but they were no match for the Godkings.</p><p></p><p>It was the monks of the Heavenly Sound Temple who grew anxious and were about to send a message.</p><p></p><p>Hum hum hum!!</p><p></p><p>Just then, a Buddha's light descended from the heavens!</p><p></p><p>The next moment, Huhai appeared between Ye Wutian and Guan Ning, sweeping his sleeve to suppress their auras.</p><p></p><p>He raised a palm to his chest and chanted a Buddhist mantra, saying calmly, "Benefactor Wutian, Benefactor Guan, today is the Buddha Master's Praise Ceremony. Isn't this a bit excessive of you two?"</p><p></p><p>Master Huhai!</p><p></p><p>The crowd was slightly startled, and everyone in the venue stood up, not daring to be disrespectful.</p><p></p><p>After all, in the Buddhist Dao, aside from the Venerable Buddha Master Jinguan, the second highest figure was Master Huhai.</p><p></p><p>The monks also felt relieved, cupping their hands in a Buddhist salute.</p><p></p><p>Ye Wutian and Guan Ning's brows furrowed slightly, but they smiled and clasped their hands in unison, "Master Huhai, we were too presumptuous."</p><p></p><p>Huhai nodded, said no more, and turned to order the monks to tidy up the venue.</p><p></p><p>At the same time,</p><p></p><p>After going through the strict order, Lu Changsheng and the others finally entered the venue and sat down in a corner.</p><p></p><p>The number of people in the venue kept increasing, packed densely, and as far as the eye could see, they were all Immortal Emperor realm experts.</p><p></p><p>Fortunately, the venue was extremely spacious, and with the containment of the formation, it did not feel crowded at all.</p><p></p><p>"Master, that is Ye Wutian."</p><p></p><p>Seeing Ye Wutian, the old turtle's anger rose, and he immediately transmitted a message to Lu Changsheng.</p><p></p><p>Lu Changsheng nodded slightly, his gaze briefly lingering on Ye Wutian and some other Godkings, a cold light flashing in his eyes, before casually scanning the venue.</p><p></p><p>Chu Lingtian and the others kept their heads slightly bowed, to avoid being noticed by Ye Wutian.</p><p></p><p>"So many powerful experts..." Yuan Yangshou exclaimed in amazement. The three elders also nodded repeatedly, their faces a little pale.</p><p></p><p>If it weren't for the Venerable Buddha Master Jinguan's passing, they would never have had the chance to witness such a scene today.</p><p></p><p>Their gazes, like the other cultivators in the venue, were focused on the twelve Godkings.</p><p></p><p>Normally, where would they have the opportunity to see such figures as Godkings?</p><p></p><p>Yuan Yangshou couldn't help but think of the mysterious Lu Daifu beside him, who was also a bigshot in his mind, after experiencing that peerless divine tea earlier.</p><p></p><p>He wondered how Lu Daifu compared to these Godkings, but shook his head and sighed.</p><p></p><p>What was he thinking? Lu Daifu was a bigshot, but he was naturally incomparable to these Godkings.</p>

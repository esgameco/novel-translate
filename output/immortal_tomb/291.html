        <h1>Chapter 291</h1>
        <div class="content">
            <p>Here is the full English translation of the Chinese excerpt:</p><p></p><p>In the southwest of the Ancient Wasteland King City, there were countless cultivators standing in the vast and open space.</p><p></p><p>In front of them, there was a massive sand curtain that stretched from the sky to the ground. The sand and gravel on it were rolling, making it look like a waterfall made of sand.</p><p></p><p>This was the first station of the Celestial Overlord Assembly - the Secret Realm of Sand.</p><p></p><p>In fact, the Secret Realm of Sand was not the real Celestial Overlord Assembly, it was just a screening process. The true Celestial Overlord Assembly would only begin after the selection of the top 1,500 participants.</p><p></p><p>Only the top 1,500 would have the qualifications to participate in the final Celestial Overlord Tea Gathering, where they would compete against each other to determine the top 10.</p><p></p><p>The Secret Realm of Sand was essentially prepared for the Celestial Overlords at the Immortal Ancestor Realm. Under normal circumstances, out of the top 1,500, 1,020 would be from the Divine Yang Realm and the Divine Origin Realm, while the remaining 9,000-plus Celestial Overlords would be competing for the 480 remaining spots, which was an extremely difficult challenge.</p><p></p><p>Lu Changsheng and the others had also arrived. They quietly observed the scene from a corner, and the others did not dare to speak, only discussing the matter in hushed tones and guiding Fu Shiyu and the others.</p><p></p><p>At this moment, hundreds of figures appeared in front of the sand waterfall, and all eyes turned to them.</p><p></p><p>"Wow, it turns out to be the people from the Mansion of the King of the Ancient Wasteland City!"</p><p></p><p>"That's not surprising, since the Ancient Wasteland Sword Clan has chosen the Ancient Wasteland King City as the venue for the Celestial Overlord Assembly, naturally they would let the City Lord's Mansion take full charge of it."</p><p></p><p>"The middle-aged man in the lead must be the City Lord of the Ancient Wasteland King City, Duan Jiuxiong, right?"</p><p></p><p>"It should be him. Lord Duan has always been quite mysterious and rarely makes public appearances. This Celestial Overlord Assembly has finally brought him out, which is not an easy feat."</p><p></p><p>"Hehe, Lord Duan is a peak expert under the Ancient Wasteland Ruins and the Ancient Wasteland Sword Clan. His cultivation must have reached a terrifying level..."</p><p></p><p>Lu Changsheng's eyes were closed under the bronze mask, as if he was resting. However, Li Shuryan and Liu Tu, who were in the Divine Yang Realm, looked at Duan Jiuxiong with grave expressions, sensing his overwhelming strength that seemed undefeatable. As for Fu Liancai and Liu Qing, who were only in the Divine Origin Realm, they did not feel much.</p><p></p><p>At this moment, Duan Jiuxiong took a step forward, raising his hand slightly. His expression was cold and stern, but he exuded the aura of the lord of the central great city of the Ancient Wasteland Ruins, without any sign of timidity before the countless people.</p><p></p><p>The entire venue fell silent, as everyone knew that Lord Duan was about to speak.</p><p></p><p>Duan Jiuxiong's stern face revealed a slight smile as he said, "I am Duan Jiuxiong, the City Lord of the Ancient Wasteland King City. I believe many of you here are familiar with me, so I won't introduce myself further."</p><p></p><p>Numerous voices of praise immediately arose:</p><p></p><p>"Lord Duan is too humble. In our Ancient Wasteland Ruins, there is only one King City, so who wouldn't know Lord Duan?"</p><p></p><p>"Lord Duan, you are too modest. Rest assured, we will all behave properly and maintain good order during the Celestial Overlord Assembly. Whoever dares to cause trouble, I'll be the first to deal with them!"</p><p></p><p>"Lord Duan, please start already. We can't wait any longer!"</p><p></p><p>Hearing this, Duan Jiuxiong let out a hearty laugh and waved his hand, shouting, "All qualified Celestial Overlords, enter!"</p><p></p><p>In the next moment, countless streams of light surged forward from the vast sea of people.</p><p></p><p>Here is the full English translation of the Chinese excerpt:</p><p></p><p>Emerge!!</p><p></p><p>New 69 Book Bar 99shu.com</p><p></p><p>Lu Changsheng, Li Shuyan, and Fu Shiyu also headed towards the center of the venue.</p><p></p><p>Very soon, a total of 100,000 supreme talents stood in the center, clearly divided into different levels!</p><p></p><p>The 20 supreme talents of the Divine Yang Realm stood together,</p><p></p><p>The 1,000 supreme talents of the Divine Origin Realm stood together,</p><p></p><p>Then there were more than 90,000 supreme talents of the Immortal Ancestor Realm, and...</p><p></p><p>Standing alone was the supreme talent of the Immortal Emperor Realm, Lu Changsheng.</p><p></p><p>"Whew, look at those 20 top-tier supreme talents at the very front!"</p><p></p><p>"That's the Holy Son of the Blood Demon Pavilion, Esha, he's the hot favorite to win the Heavenly Talent Competition this time! I wonder if the Blood Demon Pavilion Master has come?"</p><p></p><p>"Don't be ridiculous, it's just the Sand Secret Realm, the Blood Demon Pavilion Master is a figure on par with the Duan Citymaster, how could he show up? Probably he'll only appear at the tea party."</p><p></p><p>"The Young Master of the Nangong Clan, Nangong Wenxin, the Young Pavilion Master of the Shadow Killing Pavilion, Wuying, the Young Master of the Li Clan, Li Qing, and the mysterious Blood Moon... Tsk tsk, today really opened my eyes, all the top-tier supreme talents of the Ancient Wasteland Ruins are here!"</p><p></p><p>"Hehe, not to mention the top five, even the other 15 Divine Yang Realm supreme talents, which one of them can be considered an ordinary person?"</p><p></p><p>"That's not bad, to cultivate a Divine Yang Realm in less than 10 million years, it's not just a matter of talent, but also requires massive resources."</p><p></p><p>"Hey, look at that supreme talentâ€”"</p><p></p><p>Soon, after appreciating the group of Divine Yang Realm supreme talents, their gazes directly skipped over the Divine Origin Realm and Immortal Ancestor Realm supreme talents,</p><p></p><p>and focused on that lone figure in blue robes.</p><p></p><p>Instantly, all eyes in the venue were drawn to Lu Changsheng!</p><p></p><p>Esha, Nangong Wenxin, Wuying, Li Qing, Blood Moon, and all the other supreme talents, even the organizer Duan Jiuxiong, all frowned and looked over.</p><p></p><p>After a moment of tense silence, discussions suddenly erupted:</p><p></p><p>"Whew! The only Immortal Emperor Realm supreme talent in the entire venue, terrifying!"</p><p></p><p>"Is he, is he the Immortal Emperor Realm supreme talent that has been making waves recently?"</p><p></p><p>"Yes, the blue-robed masked one, that's him!"</p><p></p><p>"Wow, this guy's Immortal Emperor Realm cultivation among so many supreme talents is really eye-catching, he didn't come just to grab attention, did he?"</p><p></p><p>"Haha, grab attention? You think it's that easy? Don't worry, since he's stolen the limelight of these supreme talents, once he enters the secret realm, a lot of people will be looking to cause him trouble! With his Immortal Emperor Realm cultivation, he'll probably be dead as soon as he enters the secret realm."</p><p></p><p>"That's true, who would risk their life just to grab attention? In that case, this person must have come with a dream, worthy of respect!"</p><p></p><p>"Apart from that, an Immortal Emperor Realm, to be able to remain calm and composed under the gaze of so many powerful figures here, this mentality is truly impressive. You're at the Divine Origin Realm, if you were under the scrutiny of so many big shots, wouldn't you be panicked?"</p><p></p><p>"I would be panicked."</p><p></p><p>"..."</p><p></p><p>Hearing the dense discussions, Liu Tu, Fu Liang, and the others who were somewhat familiar with Lu Changsheng all wiped the cold sweat from their brows.</p><p></p><p>They really wanted to say, dear brothers and sisters, the Immortal Emperor Realm you're discussing... might just be the biggest dark horse of this Heavenly Talent Competition!!</p><p></p><p>A late-stage Divine Yang Realm sword cultivator!!</p><p></p><p>Liu Tu and the others could hardly imagine, among these supreme talents, who could be a match for their senior Lu...</p><p></p><p>Perhaps only the top few supreme talents would have the strength to contend with senior Lu?</p><p></p><p>Facing the sea of discussions and countless strange gazes,</p><p>Lu Changsheng stood calmly, his expression unseen behind the bronze mask.</p>

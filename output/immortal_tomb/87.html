        <h1>Chapter 87</h1>
        <div class="content">
            <p>Here is the full English translation of the excerpt from the Chinese novel:</p><p></p><p>"Ugh...ugh...!!"</p><p></p><p>The Patriarch of the Eternal Celestial Sect stared blankly at the vast ruins below, his outstretched hand frozen in place, his pupils trembling wildly.</p><p></p><p>In just a moment,</p><p></p><p>She...her sect...</p><p></p><p>Tens of thousands of disciples and elders...</p><p></p><p>The Eternal Celestial Sect's heritage of hundreds of millions of years...all gone.</p><p></p><p>The elderly Shen Mu also trembled as he looked on. With a single palm strike, the vast expanse had collapsed - a power he had never witnessed before!</p><p></p><p>The Immortal Emperor...the most mysterious of the Five Great Immortal Emperors, the Eternal Life Immortal Emperor, was too terrifying.</p><p></p><p>"What have you done!!!"</p><p></p><p>The elder abruptly turned his head and angrily questioned the Patriarch of the Eternal Celestial Sect.</p><p></p><p>If not for something happening, how could the remote southern immortal realm have drawn the presence of the Eternal Life Immortal Emperor, the supreme figure?</p><p></p><p>It was even more impossible for the Eternal Life Immortal Emperor to personally appear and destroy the Eternal Celestial Sect.</p><p></p><p>Moreover, even when he was still a Terrestrial Immortal, the Eternal Life Immortal Emperor had vanished without a trace...</p><p></p><p>If he had not been fortunate enough to see the Eternal Life Immortal Emperor's portrait and have it deeply imprinted in his mind, he might not have recognized him today, and his sudden death would have been utterly inexplicable.</p><p></p><p>The Patriarch of the Eternal Celestial Sect said dejectedly, "I...I blocked the ascension channel..."</p><p></p><p>Hearing this, the elder sharply inhaled!</p><p></p><p>The immortal rule that no one in the four directions of the immortal realms could block the ascension channel was clearly one established by the Eternal Life Immortal Emperor himself, wasn't it?</p><p></p><p>"You...you..." The elder trembled as he pointed at her, momentarily at a loss for words.</p><p></p><p>After a moment, the elder roared, "Why did you do this, and how dare you do it!"</p><p></p><p>The Patriarch of the Eternal Celestial Sect lowered her head, speechless.</p><p></p><p>"Tell me who is behind this, and then self-destruct, and this Emperor will not act."</p><p></p><p>At this moment, Lu Changsheng looked down at her calmly.</p><p></p><p>The Patriarch of the Eternal Celestial Sect's soul trembled. The pressure from the Immortal Emperor was as heavy as a thousand catties. In the presence of the Immortal Emperor, she was but a lowly ant in the dust.</p><p></p><p>She trembled and knelt down. "Immortal...Immortal Emperor, can you..."</p><p></p><p>Seeing this, Lu Changsheng's brow furrowed slightly, and the Dao Eye's blue light began to flicker as it remotely searched the Patriarch of the Eternal Celestial Sect's memories.</p><p></p><p>Instantly, the Patriarch of the Eternal Celestial Sect froze in place, her eyes vacant.</p><p></p><p>After a few breaths, the blue light in Lu Changsheng's eyes disappeared, and he murmured, "Interesting..."</p><p></p><p>"Immortal...Immortal Emperor..." The Patriarch of the Eternal Celestial Sect's head was splitting, but she still struggled to beg for mercy, her head in her hands.</p><p></p><p>The earlier awe had completely vanished, and now she was like an ordinary woman, disheveled and utterly helpless.</p><p></p><p>Lu Changsheng waved his sleeve indifferently.</p><p></p><p>The Patriarch of the Eternal Celestial Sect then abruptly vanished from this space, erased into nothingness!</p><p></p><p>"Immortal Emperor, my Eternal Celestial Sect has violated the immortal rules and deserves its fate...I only wish to see Your Majesty in person at the end of my life, and die without regrets."</p><p></p><p>The elderly Shen Mu smiled reverently, bowed his body, and dissipated into particles.</p><p></p><p>With his lifespan already at its end, he departed this world with exceptional grace.</p><p></p><p>Lu Changsheng flickered and appeared at the ruins below, standing before Chu Xiran and Zhang Youdao.</p><p></p><p>Chu Xiran and Zhang Youdao hurriedly knelt down and prostrated themselves.</p><p></p><p>"Immortal...Immortal Emperor."</p><p></p><p>Chu Xiran's chest heaved violently, her breathing extremely rapid. As an insignificant being like her, she had never dared to hope that she would one day see the Eternal Life Immortal Emperor, the one who had disappeared for over a million years and now reappeared.</p><p></p><p>Recalling their encounter at the Nameless Tavern in the Spiritual Dust Realm, and even unknowingly pouring that Cyan Sea Immortal Wine for the Eternal Life Immortal Emperor, it all felt like a dream. Yet, at the same time, she was filled with trepidation.</p><p></p><p>Here is the full English translation of the Chinese excerpt:</p><p></p><p>Wow!</p><p></p><p>Go to the new 69 book bar â†’ 69shux.com</p><p></p><p>No wonder he could withstand the Heavenly Tribulation, no wonder his old servant was so crazed, no wonder, no wonder, too many 'no wonders'...</p><p></p><p>At the time, I thought the name "Lu Changsheng" was a bit presumptuous, disrespectful towards the Immortal Emperor of Longevity...</p><p></p><p>Turns out I was wrong,</p><p></p><p>He was the Immortal Emperor of Longevity himself!</p><p></p><p>"You two should leave this place," </p><p></p><p>Lu Changsheng said lightly with a wave of his sleeve,</p><p></p><p>and Chu Xiruo and Zhang Youdao disappeared.</p><p></p><p>He then swept his gaze across the vast ruins, and the last flickering light also vanished.</p><p></p><p>At the same time,</p><p></p><p>Chu Xiruo and Zhang Youdao appeared bewildered outside the Heavenly Eternal Sect,</p><p></p><p>where a large crowd had gathered, all staring at the Heavenly Eternal Sect area with shocked and disbelieving expressions.</p><p></p><p>"What on earth happened? The Heavenly Eternal Sect was fine, how did it become ruins? Does anyone know?"</p><p></p><p>"At first, I just heard a huge rumbling sound, so I mustered my courage and went to check, only to find the Heavenly Eternal Sect in ruins. I was dumbfounded at the time."</p><p></p><p>"The Heavenly Eternal Sect must have committed many evil deeds, provoking the wrath of Heaven, and this is Heaven's punishment, isn't it?"</p><p></p><p>"Exactly, many of the Heavenly Eternal Sect disciples were of foul temperament, good riddance to them! Whether it's Heaven's punishment or for other reasons, I applaud it!"</p><p></p><p>"Tch, you're only so enthusiastic now, but when you were being oppressed by the Heavenly Eternal Sect, I didn't hear you shouting so happily."</p><p></p><p>"........"</p><p></p><p>Chu Xiruo pondered for a long time, then took a deep breath and transmitted a message to Zhang Youdao,</p><p></p><p>"Regarding the matter of the Immortal Emperor of Longevity, keep it to yourself."</p><p></p><p>With that, she turned to leave.</p><p></p><p>"Senior!" Zhang Youdao called out, then hesitated before transmitting, "Senior, the Azure-robed Senior... who exactly is he?"</p><p></p><p>Chu Xiruo paused in her steps, then turned back and solemnly transmitted, "The place we are in now is just a remote corner of the vast Southern Immortal Realm. Sects like the Heavenly Eternal Sect are like countless stars in the sky of the Southern Immortal Realm!"</p><p></p><p>Seeing Zhang Youdao's growing bewilderment, Chu Xiruo continued, "And the Southern Immortal Realm is just one of the Four Immortal Realms - there are also the Northern Immortal Realm, the Eastern Immortal Realm, the Western Immortal Realm, and the Central Immortal Realm. Each Immortal Realm has an Immortal Emperor who rules over the boundless Immortal Realm, with supreme power and authority!"</p><p></p><p>"And the Azure-robed Senior you mentioned, he is the Immortal Emperor of the Central Immortal Realm - the Immortal Emperor of Longevity."</p><p></p><p>Hearing this, Zhang Youdao's face was filled with shock, his entire body numb, as if countless insects were crawling all over him.</p><p></p><p>The Azure-robed Senior... was actually...</p><p></p><p>Chu Xiruo thought for a moment, then looked at Zhang Youdao and said, "Normally, you would have been received by a sect after passing through the ascension channel, but unfortunately, you were intercepted by the Heavenly Eternal Sect. How about you join my family for now?"</p><p></p><p>Zhang Youdao looked up, his face showing some hesitation.</p><p></p><p>"Don't worry, my family may not be as powerful as the Heavenly Eternal Sect, but it does have some foundation. It should be sufficient for you, a newcomer to the Immortal Realm," Chu Xiruo said in a calm voice, her eyes still fixed on Zhang Youdao.</p><p></p><p>Whether he agreed or not, he had to agree! She didn't know if the Immortal Emperor of Longevity had any plans, and if this Zhang Youdao were to expose it, it would be disastrous if the Immortal Emperor came looking for them. </p><p></p><p>So it would be better to bring this Zhang Youdao back to the family.</p><p></p><p>Zhang Youdao fell silent, thinking that as a newcomer, he was still quite weak, and finding a place of refuge would be more stable for the time being. He then respectfully said, "Then I'll trouble the Senior."</p>

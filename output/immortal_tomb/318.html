        <h1>Chapter 318</h1>
        <div class="content">
            <p>Here is the full English translation of the Chinese excerpt:</p><p></p><p>What?!</p><p></p><p>The powerful experts from various ancient tribes were stunned, their gazes changing. üíéüòÇ‚ûÖ‚ûà‡∏£ùêáùï¶ùîÅ.ùïîùì∏–ºüò°üòù</p><p></p><p>The Ancient Desolate Sword Tribe has been annihilated?</p><p></p><p>How is that possible? When did this happen?</p><p></p><p>If this news had come from someone else, they would have scoffed at it, but since it was said by the Dao Origin, it's a different story!</p><p></p><p>The Dao Origin would not make such a joke.</p><p></p><p>"I'll go take a look."</p><p></p><p>At this moment, a powerful expert from the Ancient Void Beast Clan coldly said a sentence and then burrowed into the space.</p><p></p><p>The other ancient tribe experts heard this and their gazes flickered as they silently waited.</p><p></p><p>In terms of speed, the Ancient Void Beast Clan was the fastest. At full force, it would only take the time of a cup of tea to travel from their Ancient Abyss Domain to the Ancient Desolate Ruins.</p><p></p><p>Time slowly passed, and soon, the voice of the Ancient Void Beast Clan expert on the Ancient Desolate Ruins side rang out: "What he said is true."</p><p></p><p>Not to mention the shock and despair of the living beings from various regions, even the pupils of the ancient tribe experts suddenly constricted - the Ancient Desolate Sword Tribe had truly been annihilated?</p><p></p><p>There was no need to think about it, it must have happened not long ago, otherwise, how could they not have received any news about it?</p><p></p><p>"Was it you who did this?" An ancient tribe expert asked in a deep voice, obviously asking the Dao Origin.</p><p></p><p>The other ancient tribe experts also had gloomy expressions on their faces. The annihilation of the Ancient Desolate Sword Tribe was no trivial matter, and a conflict was inevitable.</p><p></p><p>Otherwise, who knows which of their seven tribes would be next?</p><p></p><p>However, there was one thing that made them doubtful. The Dao Origin of the Eternal Celestial Domain wanting to suppress the Ancient Desolate Sword Tribe could not have been that easy.</p><p></p><p>It was possible for them to want to annihilate the Ancient Desolate Sword Tribe, but the time it would have taken would not have been short!</p><p></p><p>But why had they not received any news of such a prolonged great battle and commotion?</p><p></p><p>The Dao seemed to have glanced at the azure-robed figure on the edge of the Moon Star Domain, feeling wary in its heart, and then indifferently said, "It was not I who annihilated them, and I will not tell you who did. Today, I am not here to get entangled with you over the Ancient Desolate Sword Tribe. Five Boundless Dao have been destroyed, and you must apologize."</p><p></p><p>The ancient tribe experts were instantly enraged!</p><p></p><p>To make them apologize, they were dreaming!</p><p></p><p>At the moment, they had no time to think about the Boundless Dao, the matter of the annihilation of the Ancient Desolate Sword Tribe was far too significant!</p><p></p><p>Boom!</p><p></p><p>The next moment, the vast Dao Realm auras erupted in various regions of the Eternal Celestial Domain!</p><p></p><p>"Hehe, still want an apology? Our ancient tribes destroying your five Boundless Dao is nothing compared to you Dao Origin destroying the Ancient Desolate Sword Tribe... Today, you Dao Origin must pay the price!"</p><p></p><p>"That's right, since you've annihilated the Ancient Desolate Sword Tribe, be prepared to withstand the wrath of our other seven tribes!"</p><p></p><p>Biting cold killing intent permeated the heavens, and the living beings watching this scene were terrified!</p><p></p><p>The seven major ancient tribes were going to wage war against the Dao Origin!</p><p></p><p>If they really fought...</p><p></p><p>The Dao Origin also hesitated. If they really fought, it would not be a match for the seven ancient tribes, not because it feared their top experts, but because of the ancient tribes' foundations...</p><p></p><p>Just like the Annihilation Sword Venerable of the Ancient Desolate Sword Tribe, Sword Regretless, what it feared the most was this.</p><p></p><p>"You are going to attack, and would rather fight than apologize? Do you not know that if a battle erupts, the Eternal Celestial Domain will not know peace? This is also your dwelling place." The Dao spoke indifferently.</p><p></p><p>If this Origin was damaged, then the Eternal Celestial Domain would not be far from destruction.</p><p></p><p>"Hehe, a single domain is nothing, we can simply find another world to dwell in. The Eternal Celestial Domain just happens to be convenient."</p><p></p><p>Here is the full English translation of the Chinese excerpt:</p><p></p><p>"I'm tired of it," he said.</p><p></p><p>Tian Dao heard this and solemnly said, "What about the countless living beings in the Yongzhou Great Realm?"</p><p></p><p>"If they die, they die. What does it have to do with our ancient clans?" </p><p></p><p>Tian Dao fell silent, unable to refute.</p><p></p><p>But the hearts of the countless living beings in the Yongzhou Great Realm were chilled with anxiety - they desperately hoped the two sides wouldn't start fighting...</p><p></p><p>Suddenly, two indescribable auras descended upon Yongzhou!</p><p></p><p>The powerful experts of the ancient clans' expressions changed slightly. </p><p></p><p>Tian Dao's primal spirit was filled with a mix of joy and resignation as he respectfully greeted, "Greetings, Yongzhou Great Realm's Tian Dao Origin."</p><p></p><p>The Tian Dao Lords... the expressions of the ancient clans' experts abruptly turned grave.</p><p></p><p>Were these the two Tian Dao Lords who governed this boundless void? </p><p></p><p>They still had confidence facing the Tian Dao Origin of their own realm, but with the addition of a Tian Dao Lord, the ancient clans would have a hard time.</p><p></p><p>It was unclear who would emerge victorious.</p><p></p><p>Fortunately, the Tian Dao Lords also belonged to the Wujie Tian Dao domain, so even though they descended upon the Yongzhou Great Realm, they couldn't fully unleash their powers. Otherwise, the eight ancient clans would truly be doomed.</p><p></p><p>At this moment, two human-sized illusory figures slowly materialized in the sky - the two Tian Dao Lords.</p><p></p><p>One of them spoke coldly, "You eight ancient clans are something, annihilating five middle-world level Wujie Tian Dao realms at once."</p><p></p><p>The other Tian Dao Lord also said, "All this time, we've been turning a blind eye to you eight ancient clans. But who would've thought you've become so lawless!"</p><p></p><p>"Don't think we're giving you face. We're only giving face to your founding ancestors."</p><p></p><p>Hearing this, the expressions of the ancient clans' experts changed. They truly were the Tian Dao Lords, even knowing the deepest roots of their clans.</p><p></p><p>But the matter at hand could not be easily resolved, for the ancient clans had never bowed their heads to anyone!</p><p></p><p>In the next moment, the powerful experts of the Void Ancient Beast King Clan spoke first, "No need for more words. You Tian Dao and our ancient clans have been covertly fighting for years. Today, let's have an upright battle and see who is the true ruler of this void!"</p><p></p><p>"Hehe, if you wish to fight, then fight. We've come today to show you the colors of the ancient clans."</p><p></p><p>One Tian Dao Lord said, then continued, "Yongzhou, you step back. You don't need to intervene. Just protect yourself."</p><p></p><p>The Tian Dao Origin of the Yongzhou Great Realm was absolutely indispensable. If it made a mistake, the collapse of Yongzhou would be their fault.</p><p></p><p>"Understood," the Tian Dao Origin responded softly before retreating.</p><p></p><p>The Yongzhou Great Realm fell into a brief silence, but soon the powerful experts from the various ancient clans began converging towards the center of the sky above Yongzhou, accompanied by the Void Ancient Beast King Clan's cold words: "What of the Tian Dao Lords? We seven clans have nearly sixty Saint Dao Realm experts - do you think we can't subdue two Wujie Tian Dao Lords?!"</p><p></p><p>The ancient clans' experts were not panicked, for in the Yongzhou Great Realm, the two Tian Dao Lords would be restricted.</p><p></p><p>And they, without any reservations!</p><p></p><p>After the time it takes to drink a cup of tea, a unprecedented explosive sound reverberated, and the heavens and earth began to tremble and shake!</p><p></p><p>Everyone knew - the great battle had begun!</p><p></p><p>...</p><p></p><p>On the edge of the Moon Star Domain, Lu Changsheng had somehow brought out a rocking chair and was lying on it, a carefree smile on his face, completely unconcerned by the continuous battle sounds echoing through the heavens and earth.</p><p></p><p>Li Shuoyan and Xue Yue, however, were deathly pale, their palms damp with cold sweat.</p><p></p><p>The disturbances in the sky were simply too intense - they could scarcely imagine how violent the battle above must be.</p><p></p><p>People like them would likely be reduced to nothingness if they even slightly entered that battlefield.</p><p></p><p>At this moment, Lu Changsheng looked at Xue Yue and said, "Look at me."</p><p></p><p>Xue Yue hesitated for a moment, then quickly looked at him, only to see a trace of blue in Lu Changsheng's pupils.</p><p></p><p>She abruptly froze in place, but soon regained her senses, staring at the young man before her in fright, taking a few steps back.</p><p></p><p>"Master... Senior..."</p>

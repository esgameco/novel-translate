        <h1>Chapter 207</h1>
        <div class="content">
            <p>Here is the full English translation of the excerpt from the Chinese novel:</p><p></p><p>Zhao Wuyou's words fell,</p><p></p><p>and everyone stiffened, their bodies shivering violently!</p><p></p><p>Their faces were pale, and even though the weather was bitterly cold, cold sweat beaded on their foreheads, quickly freezing into frost.</p><p></p><p>In the human domain, how dare someone say that the Xuanhuo Sect is bullshit??</p><p></p><p>This is unprecedented!</p><p></p><p>Fu Mingyan's face turned black as he turned his head and shouted,</p><p></p><p>"What are you all still standing there for? Quickly subdue this arrogant wretch!!"</p><p></p><p>Today, since this person dares to insult his Xuanhuo Sect, he must be made an example of!</p><p></p><p>"Yes!" The five behind him snapped back to their senses, their eyes sharpening as they flashed away!</p><p></p><p>Surging immortal aura erupted from their bodies, the overwhelming pressure of Immortal Kings blanketing the area!!</p><p></p><p>But before they could even begin their hand seals, Zhao Wuyou merely sneered disdainfully!</p><p></p><p>"Immortal Kings? Such trash, don't even bother coming out to embarrass yourselves. Get lost!!"</p><p></p><p>"Shadow Concealment Technique."</p><p></p><p>As Zhao Wuyou uttered these low words, he placed a single hand seal on his chest,</p><p></p><p>and in the next moment, a black shadow flashed out from between his brows, dividing into five, instantly binding the five Immortal Kings!</p><p></p><p>Taken by surprise, they were ruthlessly dragged down from the sky by the five black shadows!</p><p></p><p>One end of the black shadows was embedded in the ground, as if taking root, while the other end bound them, and then the five black shadows violently slammed the five Immortal Kings into the ground!</p><p></p><p>Boom, boom, boom, boom, boom...</p><p></p><p>One savage impact after another, the frequency extremely fast, as if pounding on the hearts of the onlookers, who were horrified beyond measure at this strange technique.</p><p></p><p>The ground shook, snow spraying, already blasted into a huge crater.</p><p></p><p>The five Immortal Kings, struck with such force, were utterly helpless against this unheard-of method. </p><p></p><p>Their bodies were covered in bloody traces, the pain excruciating, their minds reeling, the bizarre black shadows seeming to have a method of numbing the spirit as well as brute force.</p><p></p><p>When the black shadows retreated back into Zhao Wuyou's mind,</p><p></p><p>the five Immortal King realm experts were already lying collapsed in the huge crater, blood flowing from their seven orifices, barely clinging to life.</p><p></p><p>They were indeed Immortal Kings, but in the face of this Eighth Realm Immortal Venerable Zhao Wuyou, they were mere insects.</p><p></p><p>In fact, Zhao Wuyou had been quite restrained, otherwise he wouldn't have needed to use such a small trick, a mere wisp of pressure could have crushed the five Immortal Kings.</p><p></p><p>At the same time, the various sects present were dumbfounded.</p><p></p><p>Not only them, even Fu Mingyan on the palace balcony had his eyelids twitching violently,</p><p></p><p>Leifeng and Leiying had also risen from their seats,</p><p></p><p>They and the two protective disciples behind them were staring at the Zhao Wuyou in midair with the utmost gravity.</p><p></p><p>This person, an Immortal Venerable realm expert without a doubt!!</p><p></p><p>This Xiao Yao Sect...</p><p></p><p>"Hehe, this Xuanhuo Sect elder, if you are not satisfied, you can come and spar with me... Also, I am only a lowly elder in the Xiao Yao Sect."</p><p></p><p>Zhao Wuyou said indifferently, his gaze and aura firmly locked onto Fu Mingyan!</p><p></p><p>Hearing his words, the crowd was already shocked beyond measure!</p><p></p><p>This masked man's strength, being only a lowly elder in the Xiao Yao Sect?</p><p></p><p>The Xiao Yao Sect, truly so terrifying?</p><p></p><p>Fu Mingyan and Leifeng four people's expressions were astonished, a lowly elder?</p><p></p><p>"Your Xiao Yao Sect, behaving in this manner, aren't you afraid of incurring the wrath of the three First-Rate Sects? And what exactly are you trying to do?"</p><p></p><p>Fu Mingyan said in a cold voice, temporarily suppressing the fury in his heart!</p><p></p><p>Because... the opponent is too strong, and there are too many of them!</p><p></p><p>Zhao Wuyou sneered coldly, raising a finger and saying, "No need to say anything else, the sole purpose of our Xiao Yao Sect's visit to the Extreme Cold Ice Origin is to win the first place in the Nine Realms Sect Competition."</p><p></p><p>Here is the full English translation of the Chinese excerpt:</p><p></p><p>Fu Mingyan was taken aback, and unconsciously said, "Your Xiao Yao Sect is currently showing such strength that it can even be promoted to a third-grade or second-grade sect. Why are you so... towards the first place of this meager ninth-grade sect competition?"</p><p></p><p>But before he could finish his words, he seemed to have realized something, and his pupils suddenly contracted!</p><p></p><p>It was not just him, but also the four people of Lei Yu, and all the sects present were shocked in their hearts!</p><p></p><p>Two words suddenly appeared in everyone's mind!!</p><p></p><p>—Skipping ranks!</p><p></p><p>What does the Xiao Yao Sect want to do?</p><p></p><p>Given the strength the Xiao Yao Sect has shown, are they going to challenge the second-grade sects and take their place?</p><p></p><p>It's very possible!</p><p></p><p>Because this is the most convenient way. If they go through layer upon layer of examinations and applications, it will take a lot of time and effort to be promoted to a second-grade sect.</p><p></p><p>But the second-grade sects are also extremely powerful. In the human domain, apart from the three first-grade sects, there are only fifteen second-grade sects!</p><p></p><p>The terrifying level can be imagined!</p><p></p><p>"Are you Xiao Yao Sect trying to... skip ranks?" Fu Mingyan asked in a stern voice.</p><p></p><p>"I've said what I needed to say. As the host of the ninth-grade sect competition, you can handle it as you see fit," Zhao Wuyou said and quickly returned to the Xiao Yao Sect camp.</p><p></p><p>Seeing this, Fu Mingyan's expression was not good, and he swept his gaze across the many sects present, with a hint of struggle in his expression.</p><p></p><p>It was not that he was unwilling to give the first place to the Xiao Yao Sect, but with so many ninth-grade sects watching, if he were to directly hand over the first place to the Xiao Yao Sect, what would these sects think of his Xuan Huo Sect?</p><p></p><p>And this scene was seen by the sect masters of various sects, who were immediately alarmed and hurriedly tried to give them a way out, saying:</p><p></p><p>"Elder, it is only natural for the Xiao Yao Sect to win the first place with their strength. We are all willing to skip the entire process!"</p><p></p><p>"That's right, that's right. All of our ninth-grade sects combined are no match for the Xiao Yao Sect. The Xiao Yao Sect winning the first place is the consensus of all."</p><p></p><p>"Without the first place, there is no first place. We will just compete for the places behind."</p><p></p><p>"..."</p><p></p><p>With the precedent of the Huo Yan Zhai, the sect masters of various sects were all speaking good words, even with flattering expressions and attitudes.</p><p></p><p>And the fact was indeed as such. After the series of events just now, the strength of the Xiao Yao Sect was evident to all.</p><p></p><p>The ranking was completely without any suspense, and no one dared to go against the Xiao Yao Sect.</p><p></p><p>Seeing this, Fu Mingyan heaved a sigh of relief in his heart. Just now, he had really been in a dilemma.</p><p></p><p>"Okay, since it's like this, then the first place of this ninth-grade sect competition will be awarded in advance..." Fu Mingyan sighed helplessly and looked towards the Xiao Yao Sect camp and shouted, "The first place goes to the Xiao Yao Sect of Cang Lan Zhou!"</p><p></p><p>Clap, clap, clap, clap, clap, clap, clap—!</p><p></p><p>Thunderous applause erupted throughout the venue!</p><p></p><p>Although it was a bit strange, it did not prevent the various sects from clapping and congratulating. After all, this Xiao Yao Sect that had suddenly emerged was truly too strong, and they had to give face.</p><p></p><p>Moreover, they were also very much looking forward to that skipping of ranks.</p><p></p><p>After the applause subsided, Fu Mingyan's eyes flickered, and a jade token appeared in his hand, which he then threw forcefully towards the Xiao Yao Sect camp.</p><p></p><p>Whoosh—</p><p></p><p>Peng Fang raised his hand and caught it steadily.</p><p></p><p>Seeing this, Fu Mingyan's pupils contracted again, and he looked at Peng Fang with a hint of awe.</p><p></p><p>He had just used force, but it was easily caught.</p><p></p><p>This sect master of the Xiao Yao Sect indeed has great strength...</p><p></p><p>After that, Fu Mingyan couldn't help but slightly cupped his hands, giving them face, and said, "This is the jade token representing the first place. The authority to skip ranks is contained within it, and you can activate it at any time... As for the rewards for the first place, after this is over, my Xuan Huo Sect will..."</p><p></p><p>"Hehe, we don't need any such rewards," Peng Fang shook his head and smiled, asking, "I'd like to ask, what are the restrictions on skipping ranks?"</p>

        <h1>Chapter 298</h1>
        <div class="content">
            <p>Here is the full English translation of the Chinese excerpt:</p><p></p><p>Swoosh, swoosh, swoosh...</p><p></p><p>One figure after another appeared from the outside, these were the ones who had survived to the end in the Sand Secret Realm. ‚òÖüíî‚ûÖ‚ùæ·îï–Ω√π·ô≠.ùïîœå‚ìú‚ôô‚òÆ</p><p></p><p>Evil Slaughter, Nangong Wenxin, Wuying, Liqing, Blood Demon Moon, and Li Shuoyan, etc...</p><p></p><p>Apart from the nineteen Immortal Sun Realm Heavenly Emperors and the nine hundred Immortal Origin Realm Heavenly Emperors,</p><p></p><p>the remaining five hundred and eighty lucky Immortal Ancestor Realm Heavenly Emperors, including the trio of Fu Shiyu, and </p><p></p><p>the sole Immortal Emperor Realm Heavenly Emperor, Lu Changsheng...</p><p></p><p>At this moment, the entire venue was deathly silent!</p><p></p><p>No one had the spare attention to care about Evil Slaughter and the other Immortal Sun Realm Heavenly Emperors,</p><p></p><p>but instead, almost all their attention was focused on Lu Changsheng!!</p><p></p><p>Shock, doubt, solemnity, bewilderment, and countless other expressions appeared on everyone's faces.</p><p></p><p>Heavens!</p><p></p><p>This... This Immortal Emperor Realm Heavenly Emperor actually survived to the end??</p><p></p><p>How did he do it?!</p><p></p><p>It's simply off the charts!</p><p></p><p>As for Miao Han Tian and the elders of the Miao Clan, who had returned to this place a few days ago, they stiffly averted their gaze from Lu Changsheng.</p><p></p><p>It can be said that among all present, they were the ones who understood the terrifying nature of the 'Immortal Emperor Realm' the best!</p><p></p><p>After all, they had already experienced the terror of the Azure Robe Senior in the Mysterious Heaven Stone!</p><p></p><p>And they had also guessed that he came from one of the Eight Ancient Clans!!</p><p></p><p>That's the Eight Ancient Clans, the pinnacle of the entire Eternal Celestial Domain!</p><p></p><p>...</p><p></p><p>Evil Slaughter, Nangong Wenxin, and the other Heavenly Emperors frowned as they looked at the azure-robed figure, their gazes flickering slightly.</p><p></p><p>At this point, anyone with a brain could see that this person was definitely not an ordinary 'Immortal Emperor Realm'.</p><p></p><p>But they didn't go too far in their speculations, not only because their pride wouldn't allow them to think that way, but also because the most important thing was that no one had seen him in action.</p><p></p><p>So this person might be at the Immortal Ancestor Realm, or the Immortal Origin Realm, or even have a chance of being at the Immortal Sun Realm.</p><p></p><p>The only thing that puzzled everyone was, how did he manage to deceive the testing stone?</p><p></p><p>Blood Demon Moon also looked at Lu Changsheng with the same gaze as the others, but in the depths of her eyes was a mix of bewilderment and reverence.</p><p></p><p>This was the most basic emotion of a maidservant towards her master.</p><p></p><p>At this moment, Duan Jiu Xiong withdrew his gaze from Lu Changsheng and swept it over the group of Evil Slaughter and the others, smiling and saying:</p><p></p><p>"Haha, good! You, as the Heavenly Emperors who survived to the end of the Sand Secret Realm, have qualified for the Heavenly Emperor Tea Talk meeting five days from now! Go back to the Royal City and prepare, you will be notified later!"</p><p></p><p>"As for the reward for surviving to the end of the Sand Secret Realm, it will be awarded after the Heavenly Emperor Assembly."</p><p></p><p>Hearing this, the Heavenly Emperors were delighted, while the many who had lost their qualifications were as if they had lost their ancestors.</p><p></p><p>Just as the Heavenly Emperors were about to pay their respects to Duan Jiu Xiong and leave,</p><p></p><p>"Father, it's that bald guy!!" </p><p></p><p>Zhou Yuan, from the crowd, pointed at Li Shuoyan in the Heavenly Emperor team and said resentfully.</p><p></p><p>Huh?</p><p></p><p>Everyone paused, then quickly turned their smiling gazes towards the upcoming show.</p><p></p><p>Countless eyes swept between Zhou Yuan and Li Shuoyan, instantly guessing the situation with eight or nine out of ten accuracy.</p><p></p><p>It seems that Zhou Yuan's unexpected explosion in the Sand Secret Realm was caused by this bald guy.</p><p></p><p>Soon,</p><p></p><p>Zhou Yuan followed the group and walked towards Li Shuoyan.</p><p></p><p>The momentum was fierce, clearly with the intention of picking a fight.</p><p></p><p>Seeing this, Fu Liang Cai, Liu Tu, and Fu Shiyu hurriedly panicked, as they all knew that Li Shuoyan was Lu Senpai's attendant.</p><p></p><p>They couldn't help but glance at Lu Changsheng out of the corner of their eyes, only to see him still standing there quietly, without any movement.</p><p></p><p>Fu Shiyu and the others were fine, as they knew well the terrifying nature of Lu Changsheng.</p><p></p><p>New 69 book ‚Üí 69shu.com</p><p></p><p>Here is the full English translation of the Chinese excerpt:</p><p></p><p>But Fu Liangcai and the others had a somewhat limited understanding.</p><p></p><p>They only knew that relying on Senior Lu's late-stage Shenyang Realm cultivation, they might have some difficulty dealing with the Wang City Zhou Clan, a powerful clan.</p><p></p><p>Fu Liangcai and the three of them exchanged a glance, gritted their teeth, and rushed towards Li Shuyan's side.</p><p></p><p>Senior Lu had taken good care of Fu Shiyou and the three of them in the secret realm, and had also helped them obtain a generous reward of 1,500 people from the two clans.</p><p></p><p>No matter how you look at it, it's still necessary to lend a helping hand, even if it's a bit insignificant...</p><p></p><p>Li Shuyan turned his head and looked at Liu Tu and the others behind him with surprise, his heart warming up a bit. He then turned around and looked at the approaching Zhou Yuan and the others with a serious expression.</p><p></p><p>In his perception, the middle-aged man in the embroidered robe who was in the lead was quite strong.</p><p></p><p>But just then!</p><p></p><p>Duan Jiuniong suddenly appeared in front of Li Shuyan!</p><p></p><p>Zhou Yuan and the Zhou Clan members were immediately stunned!</p><p></p><p>"City Lord Duan, what is the meaning of this..." The Zhou Clan Elder's pupils contracted, and after making a salute, he straightened up and smiled.</p><p></p><p>Duan Jiuniong expressionlessly said, "It's the City Lord who wants to ask the Zhou Clan Elder what he is about to do?"</p><p></p><p>Upon hearing this, the surrounding crowd was shaken, and they instantly understood the reason behind Duan Jiuniong's actions, and then looked at the Zhou Clan and the others with a strange gaze.</p><p></p><p>Zhou Zhengjiang's brow raised slightly, and he smiled, then looked at Li Shuyan: "This person has a grudge with our Zhou Clan, I hope City Lord Duan will not interfere in our Zhou Clan's affairs."</p><p></p><p>Li Shuyan sensed the murderous intent from the other party, and his inner spiritual power surged, his fists clenching slightly.</p><p></p><p>Duan Jiuniong looked at Li Shuyan and then coldly said, "The City Lord does not care what grudge the Zhou Clan Elder has with this boy, but only hopes that the Zhou Clan Elder knows that this is during the Heavenly Emperor's Assembly... and the City Lord is temporarily the organizer, so the Zhou Clan Elder wouldn't want to... slap the City Lord's face in public, would he?"</p><p></p><p>The last five words, Duan Jiuniong said in a transmission, full of warning.</p><p></p><p>Zhou Zhengjiang's fist in his sleeve clenched tightly, then slowly loosened.</p><p></p><p>As the City Lord, Duan Jiuniong was not someone the Zhou Clan could forcibly confront, and Duan Jiuniong had given him this face...</p><p></p><p>Zhou Zhengjiang knew that Duan Jiuniong was wary of the alliance of the major clans in the Wang City.</p><p></p><p>To prevent Wang City from being dominated by Duan Jiuniong alone, many major clans in Wang City had formed an alliance, precisely to restrain Duan Jiuniong.</p><p></p><p>This was like the subtle balance between the king and the officials in an ordinary kingdom, where no one could easily break it.</p><p></p><p>But Zhou Zhengjiang knew that both his status and strength were far inferior to Duan Jiuniong, the City Lord.</p><p></p><p>"The City Lord's words are heavy, it is Zhou's lack of foresight, farewell... Yuaner, let's go."</p><p></p><p>Zhou Zhengjiang made a slight salute, then led the Zhou Clan members and the unwilling Zhou Yuan away.</p><p></p><p>Seeing that there was no fight, the surrounding crowd was slightly disappointed, but it was also within their expectations.</p><p></p><p>If the Zhou Clan had forcefully wanted to kill that bald Heavenly Emperor, it would have certainly angered Duan Jiuniong, and then the matter would not have been so simple.</p><p></p><p>It would be a case of losing more than gaining, and the Zhou Clan would not do such a thing.</p><p></p><p>In fact, everyone also knew that Zhou Zhengjiang today should not have had the intention to attack in the first place, in their view, Zhou Zhengjiang today was just trying to intimidate that bald Heavenly Emperor.</p><p></p><p>"Phew~"</p><p></p><p>Fu Liangcai and the others immediately relaxed, coming back to their senses, and realized that their backs were drenched in sweat.</p><p></p><p>After all, they were from a small place, and when facing the major clans of Ancient Wasteland City, whether in terms of strength or aura, they were ultimately not enough.</p><p></p><p>"Thank you, City Lord."</p><p></p><p>Li Shuyan cupped his hands and said to Duan Jiuniong in front of him.</p><p></p><p>Duan Jiuniong turned around and looked at Li Shuyan with a strange expression, then smiled kindly and said, "No need to thank me, the Heavenly Emperor's Assembly is not over yet, and the City Lord has the responsibility to protect your safety."</p>

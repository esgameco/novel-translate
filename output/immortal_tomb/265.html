        <h1>Chapter 265</h1>
        <div class="content">
            <p>Here is the full English translation of the Chinese excerpt:</p><p></p><p>Holding his single palm upright before his chest, Jinguan said indifferently:</p><p></p><p>"It seems that this poor monk's coming to seek out Senior Lu has nothing to do with the Divine Emperor, right?"</p><p></p><p>Although his Buddhist body was not a match for Senior Lu, when it came to Yinyao, he did not need to consider his attitude. üêâüíé‚ùª‚ûàùïäƒ¶Ôºµ·ô≠.¬¢ùî¨·ó∞‚ôõüëª</p><p></p><p>Yinyao's gaze slightly narrowed.</p><p></p><p>Behind him, aside from Xing Tian, the rest of the guardians were all clenching their fists!</p><p></p><p>As long as the Divine Emperor gave the order, they would immediately attack Jinguan.</p><p></p><p>Yinyao raised his hand slightly to stop the guardians, sneering, "Dharma Master Jinguan's attainment of the Buddhist body is indeed different..."</p><p></p><p>He did not intend to fight with Jinguan. He had to admit that although Jinguan was still not his match, he was also truly powerless against the current Jinguan.</p><p></p><p>Moreover, this was Senior Lu's territory, and he did not want to court death.</p><p></p><p>Jinguan's expression remained unchanged as he took the lead and entered the town.</p><p></p><p>Seeing this, Yinyao felt somewhat displeased, and his face slightly darkened as he and Xing Tian's group of guardians followed closely behind.</p><p></p><p>"Phew."</p><p></p><p>Yuan Yang and the others wiped the sweat from their brows and slowly got up from the ground.</p><p></p><p>"Who would have imagined in the past that the Divine Emperor and Dharma Master Jinguan, such peak figures, would come to this remote little town..." An elder sighed with emotion.</p><p></p><p>Yuan Yang looked at the town and murmured, "A mountain need not be high to have immortals and thus be renowned."</p><p></p><p>The elders nodded in agreement, finding it apt.</p><p></p><p>"Let's go. Our sect has brought you here today to request that Senior Lu treat you."</p><p></p><p>"Sect Master, could Senior Lu, with his great abilities, really... After all, we are like ants to Senior Lu."</p><p></p><p>"Don't worry, our sect has learned a bit about Senior Lu. As long as you don't provoke Senior Lu, he is quite amiable towards everyone."</p><p></p><p>...</p><p></p><p>In the Longevity Medical Clinic.</p><p></p><p>Chu Ling Tian and the others were seated around the long table, chatting and laughing.</p><p></p><p>Tongxin was sweeping and cleaning.</p><p></p><p>Xiao Tong was seriously writing something behind the counter.</p><p></p><p>As for the Old Turtle, he was surprisingly seated in the corner, cultivating.</p><p></p><p>At this moment, a familiar blue figure entered the medical clinic.</p><p></p><p>"Master!"</p><p>"Grand Immortal Longevity!"</p><p>"Master!"</p><p></p><p>The group was startled, then joyfully stood up.</p><p></p><p>Xiao Tong also paused, then put down her brush and happily ran out from behind the counter, her eyes crescent-shaped.</p><p></p><p>It had been a whole year since Master last went out.</p><p></p><p>Master has finally returned.</p><p></p><p>The previous world upheaval was like the end of the world.</p><p>She had been so worried about Master, and now that Master had safely returned, it was wonderful.</p><p></p><p>Lu Changsheng swept his gaze over the group, a smile appearing on his face as he nodded slightly.</p><p></p><p>"It's been a year, you've all grown taller." Lu Changsheng looked at Xiao Tong and smiled, "How's your medical skills?"</p><p></p><p>Xiao Tong performed a salute, full of confidence, "Master, don't worry, I have no problems with common illnesses anymore!"</p><p></p><p>Lu Changsheng chuckled and went to his rocking chair, comfortably lying down and letting out a light sigh.</p><p>It had been a busy year, and he felt a little fatigued.</p><p>Lying down was more comfortable.</p><p></p><p>The others sat back down, but Chu Ling Tian and the others' faces were slightly pale and reserved.</p><p></p><p>Ever since the Miluo Snow Mountain incident, in Chu Ling Tian's heart and the others', the Immortal Longevity Emperor was no longer the same Immortal Longevity Emperor they had known before.</p><p></p><p>At Miluo Snow Mountain, the Immortal Longevity Emperor's domineering power was vividly etched in their minds, casually destroying the Heavenly Dao.</p><p>And it was he who had firmly stabilized the vast and boundless Ancestral Heavenly Realm just as it was about to collapse, using only a long sword suspended in the air!</p><p>That kind of might...</p><p>And afterwards, he had casually mentioned capturing a Heavenly Dao.</p><p></p><p>Here is the full English translation of the Chinese excerpt:</p><p></p><p>Now that the Ancestral Heavenly Divine Realm has restored order, they know that the Immortal Emperor of Longevity has really brought back a Heavenly Dao...</p><p></p><p>New 69 Book Bar ‚Üí 69shux.com</p><p></p><p>In any case, the strength of the Immortal Emperor of Longevity... is too terrifying, far beyond what they can imagine.</p><p></p><p>Chu LingtiƒÅn and the others are often perplexed,</p><p></p><p>What exactly is the Immortal Emperor of Longevity, this unfathomable great being, aiming for by serving as the Immortal Emperor in the Four Directions Immortal Realms in the past?</p><p></p><p>Is he just bored and doing it for fun?</p><p></p><p>"Master..." the old turtle was about to say something when a voice from outside interrupted him.</p><p></p><p>"Yintao, accompanied by his twelve guardians, has come to pay respects to Senior Lu!"</p><p></p><p>"Jinguan has come to pay respects."</p><p></p><p>"Yang Yang Yang Qiu has come to pay respects..."</p><p></p><p>After Yintao and Jinguan, Yang Qiu's voice sounded.</p><p></p><p>But his voice was full of trembling and lacked confidence.</p><p></p><p>Chu LingtiƒÅn and the others in the medical hall were startled, the old turtle's eyes flickered as he looked at Lu Changsheng, "Master..."</p><p></p><p>"Let them come in," Lu Changsheng said, looking at the little Tong behind the counter.</p><p></p><p>"Yes." The old turtle called out to the outside, "Come in!"</p><p></p><p>Soon, a group of people entered the medical hall one after another.</p><p></p><p>"We have paid respects to Senior Lu."</p><p></p><p>Yintao, Jinguan, Xing TiƒÅn, and the others immediately knelt down, their foreheads touching the ground, extremely respectful.</p><p></p><p>The main reason was that the incident on Mount Milo had a huge impact on them.</p><p></p><p>Chu LingtiƒÅn and the others also hurriedly knelt down, not daring to stand.</p><p></p><p>Lu Changsheng looked at them with a kind smile and said, "In my medical hall, there's no need for such formalities, all of you may rise."</p><p></p><p>"Thank you, Senior Lu." </p><p></p><p>Yintao and the others felt slightly relieved and slowly stood up.</p><p></p><p>For a moment, everyone started to examine the ordinary-looking medical hall.</p><p></p><p>When Xing TiƒÅn's gaze passed over the counter, he suddenly froze.</p><p></p><p>He saw that behind the counter, there was a little girl wearing a medicine apprentice's outfit, currently writing something with her head lowered.</p><p></p><p>This is not the key point.</p><p></p><p>The key point is that this little girl gave him an inexplicable sense of familiarity and intimacy, and the more he looked, the stronger that feeling became, causing his pupils to tremble slightly.</p><p></p><p>Xing TiƒÅn was certain that he had never seen this little girl before, but that innate familiarity... what was going on?</p><p></p><p>At this moment, little Tong also happened to raise her head and sweep her gaze across the people in front of her, finally noticing a black-armored man staring at her intently, like a pervert.</p><p></p><p>Uh...</p><p></p><p>Little Tong was only stunned for a moment before becoming confused.</p><p></p><p>Because she also had a sense of familiar intimacy towards this black-armored man.</p><p></p><p>"Xing TiƒÅn, Xing TiƒÅn!"</p><p></p><p>Xing TiƒÅn was still in a daze when Yintao's low shout suddenly rang out in his mind.</p><p></p><p>"Uh, Divine Emperor, Xing TiƒÅn is here."</p><p></p><p>Xing TiƒÅn snapped out of it and quickly responded through voice transmission.</p><p></p><p>"What are you spacing out for? Hurry and take out the gifts to present to Senior Lu!" Yintao's tone was somewhat dissatisfied.</p><p></p><p>Xing TiƒÅn didn't know how awkward the atmosphere in the medical hall had been just now.</p><p></p><p>Xing TiƒÅn cleared his throat awkwardly, then shifted his gaze away from little Tong, and with a wave of his hand, a bunch of exquisite boxes appeared on the long table.</p><p></p><p>Yintao bowed and smiled, "These are all Yintao's heartfelt gifts. Please, Senior Lu, accept them and allow Yintao the honor of paying his respects."</p><p></p><p>Although his heart was bleeding, as long as he could establish a good relationship with Senior Lu, there would be nothing but benefits.</p><p></p><p>As long as Senior Lu stayed in the Ancestral Heavenly Divine Realm for a day, Yintao would have to carefully serve him.</p><p></p><p>If he accidentally offended Senior Lu and made him unhappy one day, he was truly afraid that he would end up like Zhang Shengxu, erased into nothingness without even knowing how he died.</p>

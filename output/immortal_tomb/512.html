        <h1>Chapter 512</h1>
        <div class="content">
            <p>Here is the full English translation of the Chinese excerpt:</p><p></p><p>Watching Xin Xi's arm being torn off, the surrounding living beings and the Void Saint Demons were greatly shocked, looking at Lu Changsheng in disbelief.</p><p></p><p>But Old Turtle and Hunhui's group did not feel surprised.</p><p></p><p>They were already accustomed to Lu Changsheng's invincibility.</p><p></p><p>However, there was one thing that puzzled Hunhui's group.</p><p></p><p>That is, this monster, although its arm was twisted off by Lu Changsheng, why did it not seem to feel any pain? Could it be that these monsters have no sense of pain? That would be quite terrifying!</p><p></p><p>"You damned reptile!!"</p><p></p><p>Xin Xi suddenly erupted in rage.</p><p></p><p>Lu Changsheng then shouted, "Kneel down!"</p><p></p><p>Crack!</p><p></p><p>As the words fell, Xin Xi's lower body was suddenly cut in half at the waist, the severed end was very smooth!</p><p></p><p>Xin Xi's eyes flashed with disbelief, and his upper body fell heavily to the ground!</p><p></p><p>He looked at the nearby legs and arms, and his gaze finally became dazed!</p><p></p><p>This azure-robed being...</p><p></p><p>How could he be so strong?</p><p></p><p>The surroundings had fallen into silence, the living beings were dumbfounded, gradually becoming excited, and the Void Saint Demons were perplexed, their gazes gradually trembling.</p><p></p><p>Lu Changsheng didn't say another word, and pointed a finger at Xin Xi's forehead!</p><p></p><p>Xin Xi's pupils immediately shrank, and he glared angrily at Lu Changsheng, but his eyes soon lost focus!</p><p></p><p>The pain in his mind... This azure-robed being was actually examining his memories!</p><p></p><p>Although the Void Saint Demons had no physical pain, if something happened in their minds, that excruciating pain was still inevitable.</p><p></p><p>Soon, Lu Changsheng withdrew his finger, and with a sweep of his sleeve, shared Xin Xi's many memories with Old Turtle, Hunhui, and the others.</p><p></p><p>They suddenly realized that memories had appeared in their minds out of nowhere, which were those of the monster in front of them.</p><p></p><p>Xin Xi...</p><p>Void Saint Demons...</p><p>...</p><p></p><p>Soon, after going through Xin Xi's memories, Old Turtle, Hunhui, and the others' pupils contracted, and their spirits trembled greatly!</p><p></p><p>How terrifying the Void Saint Demon clan is!</p><p></p><p>They had never witnessed such a monstrous race!</p><p></p><p>The Xin Xi before them was only a third-level Saint Demon King, and there were actually four higher levels behind him, which showed the terrifying nature of the Void Saint Demon clan!</p><p></p><p>Moreover, they also learned the purpose of the Void Saint Demons, which was to absorb the "energy" of the Creation Pillar, hiss!</p><p></p><p>Additionally, they discovered a piece of information that was most critical and time-saving for their current mission.</p><p></p><p>Over countless years, the Void Saint Demons had established transmission wormholes in various major mother star systems through unimaginable means!</p><p></p><p>Although they did not know what wormholes were, they vaguely understood that it must be something similar to a transmission array.</p><p></p><p>With the existence of transmission wormholes, it could greatly reduce the time and effort required for their journey!</p><p></p><p>Xin Xi regained his senses, enduring the splitting headache in his mind, and glared fiercely at Lu Changsheng.</p><p></p><p>Lu Changsheng said expressionlessly, "Next, you will do as I say, or I will make your life worse than death."</p><p></p><p>Xin Xi still did not speak, only staring coldly at Lu Changsheng.</p><p></p><p>"I know you can contact your superiors, and all you need to do is tell them about my existence," Lu Changsheng said calmly.</p><p></p><p>Xin Xi's heart trembled at these words, and he then looked deeply at Lu Changsheng, sneering hideously, "You want me to contact them? Let me tell you, I'm not afraid of death! When my Void Saint Demon clan has absorbed the energy of the Creation Pillar, everyone here will die!"</p><p></p><p>"How stubborn." Lu Changsheng sneered, and a blue light flashed in his eyes.</p><p></p><p>Boom, boom, boom, boom, boom, boom!</p><p></p><p>The rapid sounds of the Dao suddenly exploded in Xin Xi's mind!</p><p></p><p>"Ah! What have you done to me, what have you done?! Ah--"</p><p></p><p>Xin Xi suddenly let out a miserable scream, collapsing to the ground and frantically clutching his head with his remaining claws, convulsing.</p><p></p><p>The surrounding living beings watching this scene trembled in their hearts.</p><p></p><p>Jack and the other Saint Demon soldiers, their confident expressions had long since disappeared, replaced by deep fear. They knew too well how powerful Xin Xi was, yet he was now like a plaything in the hands of the azure-robed being, unable to even use his own techniques.</p><p></p><p>"I'll say it! I'll say it!!"</p><p></p><p>Here is the full English translation of the excerpt from the Chinese novel:</p><p></p><p>"Ahâ€”!" </p><p></p><p>Xin Xia couldn't even last for three breaths before he let out a miserable howl.</p><p></p><p>A flash of light flickered in Lu Changsheng's eyes as he dispersed the Great Dao sound in Xin Xia's mind, then he smiled slightly, "That's more like it... Just obediently follow my instructions, otherwise even death would be a luxury for you in my hands."</p><p></p><p>Xin Xia was panting heavily now, feeling more relaxed than he had ever been before. In less than three breaths, he felt like a century had passed.</p><p></p><p>"M-My lord, I, I don't know who you are!" Xin Xia gasped.</p><p></p><p>The surrounding demons were shocked, never expecting their Lord Xin Xia to submit so quickly!!</p><p></p><p>"It's simple, just tell them that the master of this endless void has arrived," Lu Changsheng said indifferently.</p><p></p><p>Huh?</p><p></p><p>The eyes of Xin Xia and the other demons suddenly widened in shock!</p><p></p><p>The master of the endless void?</p><p></p><p>The living beings also paused, then their expressions turned to joy and disbelief as they prostrated themselves, their bodies trembling and eyes brimming with excitement!</p><p></p><p>"My lord, I-I will report this immediately," Xin Xia said tremblingly.</p><p></p><p>"No need to hurry." Lu Changsheng suddenly looked at the many holy demon generals and commanders, smiling, "I haven't seen your sincerity yet..."</p><p></p><p>Xin Xia's pupils constricted as he understood Lu Changsheng's meaning, then he stiffly turned to look at the demons led by Jack, his gaze gradually filling with killing intent.</p><p></p><p>He wasn't afraid of death, but he was truly terrified of a fate worse than death!</p><p></p><p>"Lord Xin Xia! What are you going to do?" </p><p>"Lord Xin Xia, don't listen to him, he definitely won't spare you afterwards!"</p><p>"Lord Xin Xia, we are the great Void-Devouring Holy Demons, we can't turn on each other!"</p><p>"I always thought Lord Xin Xia was unyielding, but it turns out he's just a weak coward."</p><p>"..."</p><p></p><p>The demons were scared, pleading, urging Xin Xia to calm down, and even mocking him. </p><p></p><p>These words only made Xin Xia's killing intent grow stronger!</p><p></p><p>These demon soldiers and generals were just talking big, let's see how they handle the terrifying torture!</p><p></p><p>"Die!!!"</p><p></p><p>Xin Xia suddenly roared, pointing a finger out fiercely!</p><p></p><p>The space around his fingertip began to distort, and in an instant, powerful energy waves erupted!</p><p></p><p>The surrounding space rapidly became scorchingly hot, even Old Turtle and the others felt their skin burning.</p><p></p><p>Sensing that He Xitong was unstable in this temperature, Old Turtle hurriedly cast a barrier to protect her.</p><p></p><p>In the next moment, the thousands upon thousands of Void-Devouring Holy Demons in the forefront were reduced to nothingness!</p><p></p><p>Old Turtle and the others watched with widening eyes!</p><p></p><p>This Holy Demon King was also very powerful!</p><p></p><p>The world fell silent.</p><p></p><p>In the Crimson Mysterious Heaven, only the lone Void-Devouring Holy Demon Xin Xia remained.</p><p></p><p>"My lord, then I will... report this to them..." The dejected Xin Xia carefully glanced at Lu Changsheng and said.</p><p></p><p>"Go ahead." Lu Changsheng pondered for a moment and said, "When you report, just tell them that I am the master of the endless void... Oh, and the most important thing is to describe me as extremely powerful, even more powerful than your Holy Demon God."</p><p></p><p>Xin Xia stood there dumbfounded.</p><p></p><p>Lu Changsheng continued, "En, also tell them that I will soon arrive through the transmission worm hole."</p><p></p><p>Xin Xia couldn't understand the young man's intentions, so he tremblingly said, "My lord, if I report it this way, they will definitely flee to the top of the Creation Pillar through the transmission worm hole. What exactly are you trying to do..."</p><p></p><p>Lu Changsheng sighed, "Of course I want you insects to run to the top of the Creation Pillar, otherwise it would be a hassle for me to deal with you scattered all over. </p><p></p><p>Gathering you insects together and taking care of you all at once, wouldn't that be wonderful?"</p>

        <h1>Chapter 78</h1>
        <div class="content">
            <p>Here is the full English translation of the Chinese excerpt:</p><p></p><p>Upon hearing this, the crowd's expressions were filled with disbelief. ‚òúüç™‚ûÖ‚ùæ—ï–Ωùì§–ñ.Ôº£œÉ‡πì‚ô£üíù</p><p></p><p>They didn't expect the chairman of the Heavenly Fortune Trading Association to have retreated...</p><p></p><p>He had just witnessed his own steward being killed right in front of him, yet he was able to endure it.</p><p></p><p>Moreover, a steward at the Nascent Soul stage is a prized possession wherever they go, even within the Heavenly Fortune Trading Association, where they would be considered an elite combat force.</p><p></p><p>"You all, shut up! A Transcendent Origin Realm cultivator is naturally not something we fear, but what about the young man in the blue robe sitting there? It's obvious he's the leader among them. What if he's at the Tribulation Breakthrough Realm? Now that the Patriarch has gone to the Western Regions, if the conflict escalates, who will bear the consequences?"</p><p></p><p>Zhu Qiang solemnly conveyed this to the group of stewards behind him, then turned to look at Lu Changsheng and the others, his face bearing a sincere smile.</p><p></p><p>Regarding this, the old turtle slightly raised his opinion of this short, fat man, as this fat man's thoughts were quite insightful. He then turned and asked for instructions from Lu Changsheng.</p><p></p><p>"Master."</p><p></p><p>This respectful form of address caused Zhu Qiang and the others to tremble inwardly!</p><p></p><p>Goodness, they had underestimated this young man in blue. To have a Transcendent Origin Realm Cultivator as his servant, they didn't even dare to imagine it.</p><p></p><p>At least so far, they had never seen a Transcendent Origin Realm Cultivator willingly serve under someone else, as each of them had their own dignity.</p><p></p><p>Lu Changsheng slowly rose to his feet and said with a smile, "Alright, this matter is settled."</p><p></p><p>Phew~</p><p></p><p>Zhu Qiang and the others let out a long sigh of relief. Somehow, this young man in blue had exerted tremendous pressure on them.</p><p></p><p>"Since the Master has said the matter is settled, why are you still standing there? Hurry and take us to the teleportation formation!" </p><p></p><p>The old turtle growled.</p><p></p><p>Despite being a turtle, he was not accustomed to being ordered around by anyone other than Lu Changsheng.</p><p></p><p>Zhu Qiang cleared his throat and then instructed the soot-covered stewards, before forcing a smile and saying, "Please follow me, gentlemen."</p><p></p><p>At a time like this, it was only natural for him to personally lead the way.</p><p></p><p>As Lu Changsheng and the others departed, the cultivators present were also dispersed by the stewards with grim expressions, leaving only the stewards behind.</p><p></p><p>"Ah, Sixth Brother, you died in vain! My poor Sixth Brother!"</p><p></p><p>The Fifth Steward rushed over and embraced the corpse of the Sixth Steward, weeping bitterly, and secretly removed the storage ring from the corpse's body...</p><p></p><p>The other stewards also sighed upon seeing this scene. The Fifth and Sixth Stewards had been the closest, so their grief was understandable. However, as fellow stewards, they couldn't help but feel a sense of "the fox's sorrow at the hare's death."</p><p></p><p>But after realizing the unfathomable depths of the young man in blue, they couldn't even blame the chairman. </p><p></p><p>After all, the Sixth Steward had the misfortune of encountering a formidable opponent. The law of the jungle had always been the underlying principle.</p><p></p><p>In the past, their trading association had also not hesitated to oppress other cultivators who were weaker than them.</p><p></p><p>...</p><p></p><p>"The teleportation formation is ready, fellow Daoists, please proceed!" </p><p></p><p>Zhu Qiang said with a cupped-fist salute and a sincere expression, not showing any signs of resentment, as if they were old friends.</p><p></p><p>The teleportation formation was a wide stone platform, with numerous stone pillars surrounding it, connected by chains.</p><p></p><p>On the platform, intricate arrays of symbols were engraved, appearing highly complex.</p><p></p><p>"How much spirit stones?" </p><p></p><p>Gu Helin quietly asked after the others had entered the platform.</p><p></p><p>Zhu Qiang shook his head and gently pushed the slightly bewildered Gu Helin onto the platform, then turned to Lu Changsheng, bowing slightly and saying with a smile,</p><p></p><p>"Senior, I hope you won't take today's incident to heart. It was the mistake of our trading association's stewards. Since the Senior is about to leave, I won't try to detain you. If the Senior ever visits the Heavenly Fortune Trading Association again, please grace us with your presence for a drink."</p><p></p><p>Without giving Lu Changsheng a chance to refuse, Zhu Qiang pressed the crystal button beside him.</p><p></p><p>Hum, hum, hum!</p><p></p><p>The stone platform began to vibrate, the chains clanking, and the symbols on it emitting a dazzling light.</p><p></p><p>Here is the full English translation of the Chinese excerpt:</p><p></p><p>Light.</p><p></p><p>In the next moment, </p><p></p><p>Lu Changsheng and the others disappeared in the teleportation array.</p><p></p><p>"Phew."</p><p></p><p>Looking at the empty array, Zhu Qiang felt a deep sense of relief in his heart.</p><p></p><p>They had just had a conflict today, so it was better for the great deity to leave early, lest it lead to more trouble.</p><p></p><p>Of course, his last words were spoken from the bottom of his heart. </p><p></p><p>After all, if he could befriend the mysterious man in the blue robe, it would greatly benefit his Tianyun Merchant Association.</p><p></p><p>"Ah, I should go and say a few comforting words to the melancholy stewards first."</p><p></p><p>Zhu Qiang took a deep look at the teleportation array, then turned and left with his hands behind his back, his large belly protruding.</p><p></p><p>.........</p><p></p><p>In the dark space.</p><p></p><p>"Ah, it's been a while since I've ridden such a low-level thing, but it's quite interesting." The old turtle looked around and then glanced at Lu Changsheng, "Hehe, Master, will you really grace that fat businessman from the Tianyun Merchant Association with your presence for a drink later?"</p><p></p><p>Lu Changsheng kept his eyes closed and did not respond.</p><p></p><p>Seeing this, the old turtle chuckled awkwardly, feeling rather bored, after all, in this dark space, it would take some time.</p><p></p><p>He then looked at the ancient crane, Gu Helin, and lightly laughed, "Helin, I hit you a bit today, making you cough up blood, surely you're not angry at Grandpa Turtle, are you?"</p><p></p><p>Gu Helin kept his eyes tightly shut, his face slightly pale. In this teleportation space, the speed was too fast and the suffocating feeling too strong, he had no energy left. He said with difficulty, "It's not Grandpa Turtle's fault, it was Helin's own recklessness."</p><p></p><p>This answer satisfied the old turtle, and he gently patted Gu Helin's shoulder.</p><p></p><p>Instantly, Gu Helin's dizziness and suffocating sensation disappeared.</p><p></p><p>"Thank you, Grandpa Turtle." Gu Helin was amazed and quickly cupped his hands in salute.</p><p></p><p>The old turtle waved his hand indifferently, then looked at the silent Chu Xiruo beside him, sniffed her fragrance, and laughed wildly, </p><p></p><p>"Ah, Chu Companion, are you also uncomfortable in this teleportation space? Shall Grandpa Turtle help you ease it as well?"</p><p></p><p>As he spoke, he was about to extend his turtle hand.</p><p></p><p>Chu Xiruo leaned her body aside and frowned, "Turtle Companion, please restrain yourself. As a noble cultivator of the Immortal Realm, how could I be uncomfortable in a mere teleportation array?"</p><p></p><p>The old turtle had to withdraw his hand, his expression pained, "Chu Companion, you really don't appreciate a good heart."</p><p></p><p>"Sigh, whatever, Helin, I find that you understand me better..."</p><p></p><p>The old turtle could only look at Gu Helin again, draping his arm around his neck.</p><p></p><p>"Sigh."</p><p></p><p>At this moment, Lu Changsheng opened his eyes, let out a light sigh, and a wisp of flowing light shot from his fingertip to the old turtle's mouth.</p><p></p><p>"Master, why are you sighing, mmph mmph mmph mmph..."</p><p></p><p>The old turtle was about to speak when he was shocked to find his mouth sealed!</p><p></p><p>Lu Changsheng closed his eyes and said softly, "Three days from now, it will naturally be released. I want to see if you can stay silent and not die?"</p><p></p><p>Hearing this, the old turtle's eyes lost their luster and he wilted.</p><p></p><p>Gu Helin quickly supported the old turtle, keeping a watchful eye on him.</p><p></p><p>He didn't dare admit that he was actually happy at the moment.</p><p></p><p>Chu Xiruo also had a slight curve on her lips, feeling relieved.</p><p></p><p>She looked at Lu Changsheng's back, sighing inwardly, this Turtle Companion really needs to be disciplined by his master Lu Companion...</p><p></p><p>Suddenly.</p><p></p><p>A strong light suddenly erupted in front of them!</p><p></p><p>The next moment, their feet touched solid ground.</p><p></p><p>"Welcome to the Western Regions! This is the southern part of the Western Regions, the Meiyu Merchant Association!"</p><p></p><p>A melodious and enthusiastic voice sounded in their ears.</p><p></p><p>Lu Changsheng looked up, and a few beautiful young female cultivators were respectfully bowing on the stone platform.</p><p></p><p>The old turtle saw the beautiful female cultivators and wanted to speak, but his mouth was sealed, his face flushed red, and he finally became dejected.</p><p></p><p>As for using voice transmission, he didn't dare do it in front of Lu Changsheng, and the feeling of voice transmission was too different from speaking.</p><p></p><p>Lu Changsheng walked down the platform with his hands behind his back, his gaze sweeping around, the Western Regions, they had arrived.</p><p></p><p>"Helin, reward."</p><p></p><p>He said indifferently, then walked away.</p><p></p><p>"Yes, Master." Gu Helin immediately took out a large pile of spirit stones and handed them to the beautiful young female cultivators.</p><p></p><p>They were first stunned, then their faces lit up with joy.</p><p>So many, they could barely hold them all.</p>

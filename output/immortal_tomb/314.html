        <h1>Chapter 314</h1>
        <div class="content">
            <p>Here is the full English translation of the Chinese excerpt:</p><p></p><p>The heavens and earth were silent. The rain of divine swords had ceased at some unknown time.</p><p></p><p>The ancestral founders of the Ancient Desolate Divine Sword Clan had appeared, and they even adopted a polite attitude, leading everyone to believe that the matter had come to an end.</p><p></p><p>After all, the ancestors of the Ancient Desolate Divine Sword Clan were known as the Annihilating Sword Venerable, an extremely overbearing figure whose true body did not even reside in this realm - there was much that could be imagined.</p><p></p><p>However, the next words spoken by the young man in green made everyone's hearts tighten, knowing that the matter was not yet over.</p><p></p><p>"Do I, Lu Changsheng, need to explain my actions to you?"</p><p></p><p>Lu Changsheng's mouth curved slightly, a trace of coldness flickering in his eyes as he continued, "What are you?"</p><p></p><p>Boom! The space seemed to freeze in that moment.</p><p></p><p>The Sword Ancestor and the others were shocked, involuntarily looking up at their own ancestor, only to see the smile on their face gradually disappear.</p><p></p><p>Seeing this, they felt a chill in their hearts - Lu Changsheng was courting death!</p><p></p><p>To be honest, when they first saw their ancestor's attitude, they were afraid that Lu Changsheng would shake hands and make peace with their ancestor.</p><p></p><p>Now, however, it was good. Since Lu Changsheng was courting death, let him stay!</p><p></p><p>Their Ancient Desolate Divine Sword Clan had so many disciples, they couldn't just die in vain.</p><p></p><p>Sword Wuhui raised his head and looked at Lu Changsheng calmly, smiling expressionlessly, "Young friend Lu, do you not know that there are people beyond people, and heavens beyond heavens? In this endless void, where one ring links to another, it's best for people to be low-key..."</p><p></p><p>"I've been too unrestrained," Lu Changsheng said indifferently.</p><p></p><p>Sword Wuhui paused, then shook his head and chuckled. He had seen too many who were as arrogant as Lu Changsheng, only to meet a tragic end in the end.</p><p></p><p>After a moment of silence, Sword Wuhui said softly, "Young friend Lu, if possible, I do not wish to be your enemy."</p><p></p><p>Lu Changsheng asked, "Why?"</p><p></p><p>Sword Wuhui replied, "Young friend Lu, to be able to push my Ancient Desolate Divine Sword Clan to the brink of destruction means your strength is impressive, at least extremely powerful in this Eternal Celestial Realm, beyond the limits."</p><p></p><p>Saying this, Sword Wuhui's gaze turned to the distance, a trace of worry in his eyes, "We of the Human Clan should unite to resist foreign races, rather than slaughter each other. If I were to slay you today, it would be a loss for our Human Clan."</p><p></p><p>Lu Changsheng's heart stirred a bit as he asked, "Where is your true body?"</p><p></p><p>Sword Wuhui paused momentarily, then a scroll appeared in his hand, which he tossed to Lu Changsheng.</p><p></p><p>Lu Changsheng caught it, opened it for a brief glance, then put it away, saying indifferently, "Today, the Ancient Desolate Divine Sword Clan must be destroyed, are you sure you want to obstruct me?"</p><p></p><p>Sword Wuhui's gaze sharpened, but before he could speak, Lu Changsheng waved his hand and said, "Let me remind you of one thing - I, Lu Changsheng, have always been one to repay kindness with kindness and vengeance with vengeance. If this divine sense of yours is extinguished, it will have an impact on your true body. You can weigh the pros and cons yourself."</p><p></p><p>Sword Wuhui was taken aback. He did not know how this young man could be so confident in being able to defeat his divine sense? Could he really be this arrogant?</p><p></p><p>He looked down at the Sword Ancestor and the others, a trace of disappointment flashing in his eyes. Through Lu Changsheng's words, he also understood that it was the Ancient Desolate Divine Sword Clan who had provoked Lu Changsheng first.</p><p></p><p>He had been away from the Eternal Celestial Realm for so many years that he no longer had much affection for the Ancient Desolate Divine Sword Clan. If not for the ancestral imprint he left behind being summoned this time, he might have even forgotten that he had once established such a clan.</p><p></p><p>If it were really...</p><p></p><p>Here is the full English translation of the Chinese excerpt:</p><p></p><p>It came down to a choice between Lu Changsheng and the Ancient Desolate Sword Clan. </p><p></p><p>Without any hesitation, Jian Wuhui would choose the former.</p><p></p><p>Because the human race truly needs a supreme talent like Lu Changsheng right now.</p><p></p><p>He could see that Lu Changsheng had already broken through the Divine Dao Realm!</p><p></p><p>The limit of the Eternal Vast Realm was the Divine Dao Realm, but Lu Changsheng had broken through that limit, showing his extraordinary talent.</p><p></p><p>It is not easy for the Eternal Vast Realm to produce a peerless genius like Lu Changsheng. </p><p></p><p>If he could be guided to the Divine-Demonic Battlefield... it would only benefit the human race.</p><p></p><p>Thinking this, Jian Wuhui looked at Lu Changsheng and smiled, "Young friend Lu, how about this? You are very confident, aren't you? I'll take one move against you. If you can push me back half a step or injure me, you win, and the Ancient Desolate Sword Clan is yours to do with as you please."</p><p></p><p>"But if I completely block your attack, then your grudge with the Ancient Desolate Sword Clan will be settled."</p><p></p><p>Hearing this, the crowd was greatly shocked. They didn't expect the middle-aged man, who had been scolded by Lu Changsheng without getting angry, to actually want to resolve the enmity between Lu Changsheng and the Ancient Desolate Sword Clan.</p><p></p><p>After all, Lu Changsheng had killed half the disciples of the Ancient Desolate Sword Clan. This... was this really the ancestor of the Ancient Desolate Sword Clan? It felt like they were actually siding with Lu Changsheng...</p><p></p><p>How strange.</p><p></p><p>The Sword Ancestor and the others were stunned, not knowing why their ancestor would do this. Wouldn't this just benefit Lu Changsheng? They should just kill him directly!!</p><p></p><p>The Sword Ancestor's eyes flickered, wanting to say something to Jian Wuhui: "Ancestor, Lu Changsheng has..."</p><p></p><p>But at that moment, Lu Changsheng used his finger as a sword and slashed towards Jian Wuhui!</p><p></p><p>"Swoosh!"</p><p></p><p>The sword qi shattered the space it passed through!</p><p></p><p>Seeing the incoming invisible sword qi, Jian Wuhui's expression became grave, looking at Lu Changsheng in disbelief. </p><p></p><p>He had underestimated Lu Changsheng!</p><p></p><p>This sword qi was something his divine sense could not block. If he was cut down by Lu Changsheng, it would definitely have a backlash effect on his true body in the Divine-Demonic Battlefield.</p><p></p><p>So he simply dispersed his divine sense, letting it dissipate into particles in the world.</p><p></p><p>Only a voice resounded in the heavens and earth:</p><p></p><p>"You have won. The Ancient Desolate Sword Clan is yours to do with as you please. And please, you must come to the Divine-Demonic Battlefield."</p><p></p><p>The crowd was stunned. They realized that even the ancestor of the Ancient Desolate Sword Clan seemed to be afraid, likely unable to block that sword qi.</p><p></p><p>As for the Divine-Demonic Battlefield, they didn't understand it, but they knew that the Ancient Desolate Sword Clan was finished today.</p><p></p><p>Even the founding ancestor couldn't withstand Lu Changsheng's might. What could the Sword Ancestor do?</p><p></p><p>And summoning the Annihilation Sword Venerable with the ancestral seal was their last resort.</p><p></p><p>"Hahaha!"</p><p></p><p>The Sword Ancestor paused, then suddenly burst into maniacal laughter.</p><p></p><p>The Clan Leader, Elders, and Six Great Sword Masters also fell silent, their faces deathly pale.</p><p></p><p>With the departure of their ancestor, the Ancient Desolate Sword Clan was truly finished.</p><p></p><p>It was completely different from what they had expected. Even their ancestor seemed unable to do anything against this Lu Changsheng.</p><p></p><p>At this moment, Lu Changsheng looked at the Ancient Desolate Sword Clan, his last bit of patience finally exhausted.</p><p></p><p>He then slammed down a palm!</p><p></p><p>The palm strike was without any ripples, but the next moment, the sky collapsed and the earth crumbled, with a deafening explosion:</p><p></p><p>"Rumbleâ€”!"</p><p></p><p>The entire region of the Ancient Desolate Sword Clan, spanning tens of thousands of miles, sank down!</p><p></p><p>The Sword Ancestor and the others were pressed down from the high sky, crushed into a bloody pulp along with the clan's disciples, not even having a chance to let out a scream!</p><p></p><p>From the high above, a regular shape covered the entire region of the Ancient Desolate Sword Clan. </p><p></p><p>It was the shape of a hand!</p><p></p><p>Many gazes trembled. Lu Changsheng's strength... seemed to have no limit. It seemed that this terrifying palm strike was the only time he had shown a bit of seriousness.</p><p></p><p>The Ancient Desolate Sword Clan, which had been passed down for many generations in the Eternal Vast Realm, was truly destroyed.</p><p></p><p>From this point on, the Eight Ancient Clans became Seven Ancient Clans.</p>

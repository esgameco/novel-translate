        <h1>Chapter 328</h1>
        <div class="content">
            <p>Here is the full English translation of the Chinese novel excerpt:</p><p></p><p>Ten thousand years later. ‚òúüç™‚ûÖ‚ùæ—ï–Ωùì§–ñ.Ôº£œÉ‡πì‚ô£üíù</p><p></p><p>In the boundless void, the old turtle and Li Shuyuan exited their cultivation state at the same moment on the flying chariot.</p><p></p><p>The two looked at each other, slightly bewildered for a moment, before remembering that they were still in the boundless void, heading to the Divine-Demonic Battlefield.</p><p></p><p>The old turtle quickly took out the route map, then scanned the void and frowned, "Hmm, something's not right. It's been ten thousand years, and the route is correct, so we should have arrived at the Divine-Demonic Battlefield by now, right?"</p><p></p><p>Hearing this, Li Shuyuan hurriedly stopped the flying chariot and leaned in to take a look at the route map, his brow also furrowing.</p><p></p><p>What's going on?</p><p></p><p>The old turtle and Li Shuyuan looked at each other, not daring to continue driving the flying chariot, afraid of going the wrong way.</p><p></p><p>"Let me see."</p><p></p><p>At this moment, Lu Changsheng stepped out of the chariot, waving his hand, and the route map in the old turtle's hand flew into his own.</p><p></p><p>"Master."</p><p>"Sir."</p><p></p><p>The old turtle and Li Shuyuan quickly stood up and paid their respects.</p><p></p><p>Lu Changsheng ignored the two, instead spreading out the route map and fixing his gaze upon it.</p><p></p><p>After a moment, he tossed the map back to the old turtle and pointed in a direction, saying, "Go that way."</p><p></p><p>"Yes."</p><p></p><p>The old turtle and Li Shuyuan naturally did not dare to question, and Li Shuyuan immediately controlled the flying chariot to soar in the direction Lu Changsheng had indicated.</p><p></p><p>The two of them did not dare to speak this time, as Lu Changsheng did not return to the chariot, but stood behind them with his hands clasped.</p><p></p><p>The flying chariot continued to fly for several months, with the three of them maintaining the same posture.</p><p></p><p>"Sss, could that be the Divine-Demonic Battlefield?!"</p><p></p><p>Suddenly, a distant light ball caught the attention of the old turtle and Li Shuyuan.</p><p></p><p>They were utterly shocked!</p><p></p><p>Although from this distance, the light ball appeared small, when they compared it to the tiny stars around it, they were stunned!</p><p></p><p>Those tiny stars were definitely one world after another, but they all paled in comparison to that light ball!</p><p></p><p>"Master."</p><p></p><p>The old turtle turned to look at Lu Changsheng for instructions.</p><p></p><p>"Go, it will probably take a few more years to get there," Lu Changsheng said with a smile.</p><p></p><p>Hearing this, the old turtle and Li Shuyuan were stunned. They had already seen the Divine-Demonic Battlefield, yet they still had to fly for a few more years?</p><p></p><p>Afterwards, the flying chariot suddenly accelerated towards the light ball.</p><p></p><p>As the days passed, the size of the light ball in their vision remained the same, seemingly without any change.</p><p></p><p>The old turtle and Li Shuyuan finally understood the meaning of Lu Changsheng's "a few more years."</p><p></p><p>It seems the Divine-Demonic Battlefield is truly massive...</p><p></p><p>It is the largest world they have ever seen.</p><p></p><p>The old turtle had traveled with Lu Changsheng for so many years, but had never seen a world this vast.</p><p></p><p>...</p><p></p><p>Five years later.</p><p></p><p>The Divine-Demonic Battlefield, boundless and vast, shrouded in the mist of war. It would be more accurate to call it a pure battlefield than a world.</p><p></p><p>After all, what world would be named after a battlefield?</p><p></p><p>Here, there is constant intrigue, friction, and war among the myriad races.</p><p></p><p>In the sky above the Divine-Demonic Battlefield, three massive, brilliantly shining rankings are permanently displayed:</p><p></p><p>The Myriad Races Ranking, the Divine Body Ranking, and the Individual Combat Strength Ranking!</p><p></p><p>The Myriad Races Ranking is densely packed with characters, with the font size getting smaller towards the back. Except for the hegemon races at the top, the rankings of the weaker races are constantly changing!</p><p></p><p>The Divine Body Ranking has far fewer characters, also decreasing in size from top to bottom. At a glance, there are only a hundred or so divine body types, each marked with a certain race.</p><p></p><p>Here is the full English translation of the Chinese excerpt:</p><p></p><p>The Single Combat Power Ranking was equally concise, with only a hundred names on the list, each bearing the name of a certain clan or tribe.</p><p></p><p>It was not difficult to notice that many of the names appeared on both the Divine Body Ranking and the Single Combat Power Ranking.</p><p></p><p>Moreover, the clans or tribes to which these names belonged were mostly ranked very high on the Myriad Tribes Ranking!</p><p></p><p>The three major rankings were closely interlinked.</p><p></p><p>On the Myriad Tribes Ranking, the human race was ranked around the thousandth position, which was not too bad.</p><p></p><p>However, on the Divine Body Ranking, there were no powerful human experts to be found.</p><p></p><p>As for the Single Combat Power Ranking, when scanning from top to bottom, the first name was not a human, the second was not a human, and neither were the first ninety-nine names...</p><p></p><p>Until the hundredth name!</p><p></p><p>Finally, a name with the human race prefix appeared!</p><p></p><p>Human, Jian Wuhui!</p><p></p><p>"Jian Wuhui," Lu Changsheng murmured with a smile as he looked up at the last name on the Single Combat Power Ranking.</p><p></p><p>"Master, do you know this Jian Wuhui?" the old turtle asked in surprise.</p><p></p><p>"Ahem, Senior Turtle, this Jian Wuhui is the one our lord encountered when he annihilated the ancient Huangshen Sword Clan in the Eternal Realm," Li Shuyan explained.</p><p></p><p>"I see... You little rascal, why didn't you tell me about this earlier?" the old turtle said, somewhat dissatisfied, looking at Li Shuyan.</p><p></p><p>Li Shuyan awkwardly replied, "I forgot."</p><p></p><p>Lu Changsheng and the others had also traveled by flying carriage for five more years before entering this mysterious battlefield. As soon as they arrived, they noticed the massive rankings hanging in the sky.</p><p></p><p>Lu Changsheng swept his gaze across the three rankings and said with interest, "It seems we haven't come to the wrong place. This is quite interesting."</p><p></p><p>The old turtle and Li Shuyan both nodded in agreement.</p><p></p><p>"Let's go," Lu Changsheng said, randomly heading in a direction, which left the old turtle and Li Shuyan puzzled.</p><p></p><p>They hurriedly followed him, and the old turtle respectfully asked, "Master, since we've just arrived and are unfamiliar with this place, do you already know where we're going?"</p><p></p><p>Lu Changsheng replied calmly, "Of course, we're going to the human race. Just by walking, we're bound to encounter some other tribes, and then we can ask for the location of the human race."</p><p></p><p>"That's right. Shuyan, the people from Tongxin Forest and Xiaoyao Sect are all from the human race," the old turtle said with a wry smile.</p><p></p><p>Li Shuyan was taken aback. What did that mean? Wasn't their master from the human race?</p><p></p><p>The old turtle seemed to sense Li Shuyan's confusion and quickly cleared his throat, speaking in a mysterious tone, "Perhaps our master is not human. But I don't know the specifics."</p><p></p><p>Lu Changsheng narrowed his eyes. Although the old turtle's words were not wrong, it felt like he was subtly insulting him.</p><p></p><p>The old turtle immediately sensed Lu Changsheng's murderous intent and hurriedly backed away dozens of yards, frantically waving his hands and explaining, "Master, the old turtle wasn't cursing you! The old turtle wouldn't dare!"</p><p></p><p>Lu Changsheng let out a faint, cold smile, about to teach the old turtle a lesson, when suddenly his brow furrowed. He had sensed a presence in his perception.</p><p></p><p>Clasping his hands behind his back, he headed in that direction.</p><p></p><p>The old turtle heaved a sigh of relief, wiping the cold sweat from his forehead. He and Li Shuyan quickly followed Lu Changsheng, soon disappearing into the battlefield's mist, sensing numerous other presences.</p><p></p><p>At the same time, in the mist where Lu Changsheng had gone, dozens of figures were wandering, seemingly searching for something.</p><p></p><p>"Hmm? It seems there are living beings approaching us. I wonder which tribe they belong to," a young man in a luxurious golden robe, with horns on his forehead, said calmly, exuding an aura of dominance.</p><p></p><p>The other tribe members, upon hearing this, immediately became alert, sensing two auras rapidly approaching their location.</p><p></p><p>And they would arrive soon!</p>

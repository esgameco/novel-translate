        <h1>Chapter 38</h1>
        <div class="content">
            <p>Here is the full English translation of the Chinese excerpt:</p><p></p><p>After a long while. üò≤‚ôû‚ùª‚ûà≈ü–Ω√πùêó.ƒÜ·óùùì∂‚úã‚ôñ</p><p></p><p>Before the pupils of the ancient crane-like elder could even contract, the Second Elder suddenly stood up, his eyes burning with excitement and exclaimed,</p><p></p><p>"An exquisite Fire Spirit Root! This is an exceptionally rare exquisite Fire Spirit Root!!"</p><p></p><p>An exquisite Fire Spirit Root!</p><p></p><p>The innocent boy looked at the kneeling youth with incomprehensible wonder, his heartbeat accelerating!</p><p></p><p>What is the concept of an exquisite Fire Spirit Root? He had already become a direct disciple of the ancient Immortal of the Azure Cloud Sect with his superior Thunder Spirit Root, so an exquisite Fire Spirit Root... he dared not even imagine.</p><p></p><p>Has the Azure Cloud Sect ever produced an exquisite spirit root before?</p><p></p><p>This kind of spirit root would incite a fierce competition among all the sects in the cultivation world.</p><p></p><p>"Exquisite Fire Spirit Root, what is that?" Although puzzled, Lin Dong also felt that he was not too inferior.</p><p></p><p>"Senior, senior, senior, do you mean..." </p><p></p><p>The gaze of the ancient crane-like elder towards Lu Changsheng was intense, and his speech was even somewhat stammering due to excitement.</p><p></p><p>"Senior! I can do it too..." At this time, the Second Elder also looked at Lu Changsheng with anticipation, his fingers even turning white from gripping tightly.</p><p></p><p>At the same time, he sighed inwardly, thankful that the Sect Master did not come to Moyu Town this time, otherwise this prodigy disciple might have been taken in as a direct disciple.</p><p></p><p>Hearing these two immortal-like elders address Lu Changsheng as "senior", Lin Dong was shocked again... Could it be that his teacher is also an immortal? And an even more powerful one at that.</p><p></p><p>At this moment, Lu Changsheng looked at Lin Dong and said,</p><p></p><p>"Isn't that the immortal you admired that night? He is the one."</p><p></p><p>Saying that, he nodded slightly towards the ancient crane-like elder.</p><p></p><p>Lin Dong looked at the ancient crane-like elder, his pupils contracting to the size of needles, his mind momentarily blank.</p><p></p><p>This, this white-bearded old man is actually the immortal from that night!</p><p></p><p>Now that he thought about it, the voice was indeed extremely similar.</p><p></p><p>"As for who Lin Dong wants to take as his teacher, let him choose for himself," Lu Changsheng did not immediately reject the Second Elder's request.</p><p></p><p>"Thank you, senior!" The Second Elder bowed to Lu Changsheng, then looked at Lin Dong and said solemnly, "I am the Second Elder of the Azure Cloud Sect. If you take me as your teacher, I will pour all my resources into you!</p><p></p><p>The best dwelling, the best cultivation techniques, the best spells, the best elixirs, the best... all will be yours!!"</p><p></p><p>Seeing the Second Elder's determination, the ancient crane-like elder's heart ached, but he also knew the importance of the exquisite Fire Spirit Root. Moreover, this exquisite Fire Spirit Root is practically tailor-made for alchemy.</p><p></p><p>And more importantly - this is recommended by the senior himself, if he says there is no connection between the boy and the senior, he would not believe it.</p><p></p><p>This young man has a connection with the senior, if he, Gu Helin, takes him as a disciple, does that mean he also has a connection with the senior?</p><p></p><p>Damn it, he must not let this happen!</p><p></p><p>His thoughts were very strong, but what he said was: "I, Gu, do not have as many grand words as the Second Elder, but I can only say that if you take me as your teacher, I will definitely be a good master."</p><p></p><p>Lin Dong did not hesitate at all, first giving an apologetic look to the Second Elder, then looking at Gu Helin, lightly knocking his forehead three times and said, "Master."</p><p></p><p>He did not know what dwelling, elixirs, cultivation techniques, or spells were, he only knew that the sentence "seek longevity, and even more seek the heroic spirit within" seemed to be engraved in his bones.</p><p></p><p>"Haha, good." Gu Helin paused, then stroked his beard and smiled.</p><p></p><p>The Second Elder sat down dejectedly, shaking his head and sighing, "Oh well, oh well."</p><p></p><p>No matter whose disciple he is, he is still a disciple of the Azure Cloud Sect.</p><p></p><p>"Alright, Lin Dong, come stand beside your senior disciple behind me."</p><p></p><p>Here is the full English translation of the Chinese excerpt:</p><p></p><p>"Rise, and for the grand ceremony of taking you as a disciple, after returning to the sect, I will definitely hold a grand celebration for you," said Elder Gu Helin with a warm smile to Lin Dong.</p><p></p><p>"Thank you, Shifu," Lin Dong replied.</p><p></p><p>Lin Dong then turned to Lu Changsheng and kowtowed three times solemnly, his eyes slightly reddened, and he trembled as he said, "Mast... Master, thank you for granting Lin Dong such an opportunity."</p><p></p><p>Lu Changsheng nodded graciously to accept the three kowtows, and asked, "Lin Dong, the path of cultivation is tedious and full of life-and-death trials. How will you face these challenges?"</p><p></p><p>Lin Dong answered resolutely, "My initial aspiration will not be extinguished."</p><p></p><p>"Good," Lu Changsheng said, with a hint of a smile in his eyes.</p><p></p><p>Gu Helin and the Second Elder were stunned, looking at this 11-year-old youth with disbelief. </p><p></p><p>Whether it was his rare spiritual root or his temperament, he was simply born to cultivate the Dao!</p><p></p><p>Especially the young Tong Xin, who was staring at Lin Dong with a sense of crisis in his heart, thinking that this future junior brother was a bit terrifying - what if he snatched away the master's love?</p><p></p><p>"Alright, you may all leave now," Lu Changsheng waved his hand.</p><p></p><p>Gu Helin and the Second Elder quickly stood up, bowed to Lu Changsheng, and left with Tong Xin and Lin Dong.</p><p></p><p>...</p><p></p><p>"Lin Dong junior brother, do you want to fly in the sky?" Tong Xin asked Lin Dong with a smile as they walked out of the courtyard.</p><p></p><p>"Shi... Shixiong, I do!" Lin Dong nodded eagerly.</p><p></p><p>Tong Xin laughed heartily, and looked at Gu Helin: "Master, may your disciple take the junior brother to experience it?"</p><p></p><p>Gu Helin glanced at the eager Lin Dong and waved his hand, "Go, but be careful."</p><p></p><p>With that, he and the Second Elder exchanged a smile and left slowly. They were now living in the Zhuzhu Mansion along with a group of Foundation Establishment disciples, but all the disciples were strictly forbidden from wandering around, and could only stay in their rooms to cultivate.</p><p></p><p>Seeing them leave, Tong Xin took out the flying carpet, infused it with spiritual power, and the carpet suddenly expanded and hovered in the air!</p><p></p><p>Lin Dong's eyes widened with excitement as he watched this scene.</p><p></p><p>Tong Xin hugged Lin Dong and soared up, landing steadily on the flying carpet.</p><p></p><p>"Lin Dong junior brother, you must hold on to your shixiong tightly, the first time flying in the sky can be nerve-wracking," Tong Xin said with a smile.</p><p></p><p>Lin Dong solemnly nodded, and his grip on Tong Xin's sleeve tightened.</p><p></p><p>The next moment, the flying carpet shot up into the sky with a "whoosh"!</p><p></p><p>Lin Dong's heart suddenly raced, and his eyes shone with brilliance!</p><p></p><p>This was the feeling of a celestial being flying in the sky, and from now on, he would be one of them...</p><p></p><p>...</p><p></p><p>In the Demon Realm.</p><p></p><p>Compared to the gloomy and demonic-infested Magic Realm, the Demon Realm was a verdant land with towering ancient trees and vast grasslands. Most demon beasts preferred this pleasant environment.</p><p></p><p>"Venomous Snake Demon King, when will we make a move on that Water Separation Empire? This time, we must humiliate Zhao Shenyuan!" one of the Demon Kings sneered.</p><p></p><p>Fierce Venomous Snake smiled calmly, "Zhao Shenyuan has been failing repeatedly in the Water Separation Empire, he is simply irritated that we in the Demon Realm are just watching on the sidelines."</p><p></p><p>"Zhao Shenyuan has always been arrogant, thinking that we Demon Realm are reckless, little does he know that I have become much wiser," Fierce Venomous Snake said smugly.</p><p></p><p>The other four Demon Kings exchanged glances, somewhat surprised.</p><p></p><p>Fierce Venomous Snake looked at the four Demon Kings and said, "This matter is not urgent. After all, the Water Separation Empire is just low-hanging fruit, and the Demon Sovereign and Magic Sovereign have also been inactive, not knowing when they will attack. What's the hurry for us?"</p><p></p><p>"I just want to see the expression on Zhao Shenyuan's face when we toy with him haha," he laughed.</p>

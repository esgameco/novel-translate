        <h1>Chapter 21</h1>
        <div class="content">
            <p>Here is the full English translation of the Chinese excerpt:</p><p></p><p>The air was silent. </p><p></p><p>"Do they have to kneel for an hour? They are mortal and it will be difficult for them to endure, especially since they are used to living in luxury, and the sun is getting hotter..."</p><p></p><p>The King of the離水 Kingdom rolled his eyes and staggered backwards, nearly fainting.</p><p></p><p>Seeing this, Dong Ge hurriedly tried to go over and pinch the person's Renzhong acupuncture point.</p><p></p><p>However, he was swatted away by the King of the 離水 Kingdom, who weakly scolded in a low voice: "Dong Ge, when this matter is over, you'll see how I punish you!"</p><p></p><p>Dong Ge's face turned deathly pale as he lowered his head without a word.</p><p></p><p>The other officials also looked at him reproachfully.</p><p></p><p>Damn it!</p><p></p><p>As time passed, the sunlight became increasingly scorching.</p><p></p><p>The people outside the courtyard were already drenched in sweat, and what pained them the most was their knees - from the initial pain to now numbness.</p><p></p><p>Even some maids and servants who passed by were greatly shocked!</p><p></p><p>Of course they knew who these people were, and that was why they found it unbelievable, as if they were seeing things.</p><p></p><p>One of them was a maid who had previously served beside Lu Changsheng. Her mind was particularly shaken.</p><p></p><p>"All of you servants, leave this place immediately! You've seen nothing today!" </p><p></p><p>Chen Dadao hurriedly shouted at the dumbfounded servants. These servants were courting death - seeing the embarrassing situation of the King of the 離水 Kingdom and the officials, yet not leaving immediately, if the King of the 離水 Kingdom became enraged and blamed them, he wouldn't be able to protect them.</p><p></p><p>The servants quickly left with pale faces.</p><p></p><p>As for the King of the 離水 Kingdom and the officials, they had no such thoughts. Their vision had already become blurry.</p><p></p><p>Under the scorching sun, their bodily fluids were rapidly depleting, and they were about to be baked dry.</p><p></p><p>And not even half an hour had passed yet...</p><p></p><p>"Da-Dadao, you know a Immortal, can you please go beg him? This king... really can't take it anymore..." the King of the 離水 Kingdom said with a distressed face.</p><p></p><p>"Yes, Dadao, you should go beg the Immortal, we old bones really can't handle this anymore..."</p><p></p><p>"Dadao, I've never asked you for anything in my life, please do me this favor this time..."</p><p></p><p>The officials one by one pleaded, becoming more and more absurd, some even shedding old tears.</p><p></p><p>Hearing this, Chen Dadao was suddenly reminded of Lu Changsheng's previous attitude, and hurriedly waved his hands, bitterly smiling: "Your Majesty, this humble official really isn't close with the Gentleman, the Gentleman is just temporarily staying, please don't trouble this official."</p><p></p><p>The King of the 離水 Kingdom and the officials no longer bothered him, only able to endure the pain with pale faces.</p><p></p><p>"Dadao, I have a question I must ask you truthfully."</p><p></p><p>At this time, the silent Dong Ge suddenly spoke up again.</p><p></p><p>Chen Dadao was taken aback, but nodded.</p><p></p><p>"Is the safety of Moyu Town due to the reason of this Immortal?" Dong Ge asked.</p><p></p><p>The King of the 離水 Kingdom and the officials immediately perked up, staring intently at Chen Dadao.</p><p></p><p>Chen Dadao felt immense pressure, but finally knew that he couldn't hide the truth forever, and nodded with a sigh: "Yes, the stability of Moyu Town is indeed because of the Gentleman's presence... All the demonic beasts that tried to invade were slaughtered by the Gentleman."</p><p></p><p>Hiss!</p><p></p><p>The crowd drew in a sharp breath, their expressions shocked!</p><p></p><p>All... all of them were slaughtered?</p><p></p><p>One must know that even the Immortals from the Qiyun Sect previously were unable to deal with these demonic beasts!</p><p></p><p>The King of the 離水 Kingdom opened his mouth, wanting to ask something, when suddenly a voice came from the courtyard, </p><p></p><p>"You may all leave."</p><p></p><p>The people were stunned for a moment, then overjoyed!! It seems the Immortal, though appearing stern, has softened his heart, and in less than half an hour, has forgiven them!!</p><p></p><p>They then supported each other with great difficulty and left the courtyard, bowing respectfully.</p><p></p><p>"The Immortal is magnanimous!"</p><p></p><p>...</p><p></p><p>Two days later, the countless commoners outside Moyu Town also felt their hearts relieved, and the smiles that had been absent for a long time finally reappeared on their faces.</p><p></p><p>They had been in Moyu Town for three days, and there were no more demonic disturbances!</p><p></p><p>Although the living conditions were relatively simple, compared to the panic and despair during the demonic incidents, the commoners would rather have it this way.</p><p></p><p>Here is the full English translation of the Chinese excerpt:</p><p></p><p>The sun quickly set, and time passed quickly, another day gone by.</p><p></p><p>But tonight's night seemed to have come a little faster than usual...</p><p></p><p>The army had already prepared the food, and the countless civilians outside the town started lining up with their own bowls to get their meals.</p><p></p><p>After everyone had finished eating together, the civilians all retreated into their tents early.</p><p></p><p>It was a bit chilly tonight, not suitable to linger outside for long.</p><p></p><p>Time slipped away quietly...</p><p></p><p>It was the hour of the boar.</p><p></p><p>The town had fallen into complete silence, with only a few soldiers continuing their patrols as usual.</p><p></p><p>In the distant forest,</p><p></p><p>Gu Helin and Tongxin were still sitting cross-legged on the tree trunks, not having moved from their spots for the past two days. </p><p></p><p>For these cultivators, this was nothing difficult - not just two days, but even two years, ten years, they could endure.</p><p></p><p>Cultivation knows no time.</p><p></p><p>Gu Helin closed his eyes, indifferently saying, "Tonight, something feels off."</p><p></p><p>Tongxin suddenly opened his eyes, exclaiming, "Master, you've sensed it too?"</p><p></p><p>Boom!</p><p></p><p>Gu Helin's brow furrowed as he struck out with a palm, blasting Tongxin down from the tree!</p><p></p><p>Tongxin got up from the ground, rubbing his aching chest, looking up at Gu Helin with a aggrieved pout, "Master, what did I do wrong this time?"</p><p></p><p>Gu Helin's chest heaved slightly as he took a deep breath, "I don't want to waste more words on you, fool. Enlighten yourself."</p><p></p><p>Tongxin scratched his head, not understanding what he had done to anger his master.</p><p></p><p>"Master, I..." Tongxin was about to ask,</p><p></p><p>But Gu Helin suddenly widened his eyes, solemnly saying, "It's here!"</p><p></p><p>It's here? What's here? Tongxin was puzzled.</p><p></p><p>Woooooo—!</p><p></p><p>At that moment, a howling gale arose!</p><p></p><p>The night sky's clouds gathered and dispersed, the grass and trees in the forest, and even the countless tents in the distance were violently swaying!</p><p></p><p>A thick black mist rapidly spread out beyond the town of Moyu!</p><p></p><p>In an instant, both inside and outside the town were in an uproar!!</p><p></p><p>"This, this is..."</p><p></p><p>"Why did such a fierce wind suddenly arise?"</p><p></p><p>"The army is on alert!! All the generals lead the soldiers to have all the civilians stay in their tents and not come out!!"</p><p></p><p>"..."</p><p></p><p>The commanders immediately issued orders.</p><p></p><p>But alas, the gale was too strong, and the number of civilians too vast, there was no way to convey the orders in time!</p><p></p><p>Many civilians felt the commotion and poked their heads out of the tents, only to be horrified - they had seen such strange phenomena before, and all kinds of panicked cries echoed, rapidly spreading throughout Moyu town inside and out with the gale!</p><p></p><p>"Demons, demons! Demons have come!!"</p><p></p><p>"We've traveled so far, why won't these demons leave us alone!! Heavens!!"</p><p></p><p>"Father, mother, I'm scared..."</p><p></p><p>At the same time,</p><p></p><p>The King of the Lishui Kingdom and the others in the town lord's manor were also alarmed. Led by Chen Dadao and the steward, they quickly dressed and hurried to the town wall.</p><p></p><p>In this gale, they could barely stand steady.</p><p></p><p>They were dumbfounded by the sight before them.</p><p></p><p>In the hazy night, they saw the chaos and disarray outside the town, as well as the various anguished cries echoing in their ears.</p><p></p><p>The Lishui King's expression grew grave - if a stampede were to happen now, it would be disastrous. He immediately shouted without regard for status, "Don't panic, don't panic!! It's just a sudden strong wind! Everyone, don't panic!!"</p><p></p><p>"Hahaha!! You lowly beings, thinking you can hide from the massacre of my Black Tongue Demon Tribe in this remote little town? How foolish!" </p><p></p><p>At this moment, a dark, cruel laughter resounded through the night sky!</p><p></p><p>Both inside and outside Moyu Town fell silent for a moment, then plunged into the abyss of terror!!</p>

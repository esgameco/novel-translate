        <h1>Chapter 541</h1>
        <div class="content">
            <p>Here is the full English translation of the Chinese excerpt:</p><p></p><p>Lü Changsheng looked at the bowing Zui Qiancheng without saying a word, then turned and left silently.</p><p></p><p>When Zui Qiancheng noticed and looked up in surprise, the figure in blue had already disappeared.</p><p></p><p>"Ah."</p><p></p><p>Zui Qiancheng sighed.</p><p></p><p>He recalled the scenes of Lü Sheng coming to his noodle shop, always ordering the scallion noodles, always saying he couldn't taste the flavor. Now thinking about it, it was indeed very strange.</p><p></p><p>After all, it was undoubtful that Lü Sheng already knew Zui Fuzi was a drunkard.</p><p></p><p>But as for why he said the scallion noodles had no flavor, what deeper meaning was there? Was he just simply teasing him?</p><p></p><p>"Sigh."</p><p></p><p>Zui Qiancheng sighed again. Even as the foremost of the Three Saints, with unparalleled intelligence, he still couldn't fathom Lü Sheng's hidden intentions.</p><p></p><p>"Wash the soul, enter the dream?"</p><p></p><p>Zui Qiancheng quickly shifted his gaze to the two jars of wine. His eyes flickered, and he then opened one of the wine stoppers.</p><p></p><p>As the rich aroma of the wine spread out, Zui Qiancheng was instantly invigorated!</p><p></p><p>Good, good wine!</p><p></p><p>...</p><p></p><p>When Lü Changsheng walked back to the academy, the second class of the morning was just about to begin.</p><p></p><p>Han Yue, Ye Xiaoxiao, and Xiao Fan were already sitting properly, with the textbook "Cultivating Qi Technique" placed on the desks in front of them.</p><p></p><p>"How is the cultivation of the Cultivating Qi Technique going?" Lü Changsheng asked calmly from the podium.</p><p></p><p>Ye Xiaoxiao and Xiao Fan stammered, but it was the usually poorly-studied Han Yue who raised his hand and said, "Teacher, the student has already sensed the existence of qi!"</p><p></p><p>Hearing this, Ye Xiaoxiao and Xiao Fan were shocked.</p><p></p><p>So fast?</p><p></p><p>"Correct." Lü Changsheng nodded slightly, "Sensing the book qi is only the first step. The next most important thing is to absorb the book qi into the ink source."</p><p></p><p>Ink source!</p><p></p><p>The three of them were startled. They of course knew what the ink source was, as it was written in the Cultivating Qi Technique.</p><p></p><p>The ink source is not something everyone has, because the ink source can only appear in the dantian after being blessed by the saints of heaven and earth. The ink source is the core power of book cultivation.</p><p></p><p>With the ink source, one can be considered a true book cultivator, and the larger the ink source, the purer and more abundant the book qi, the stronger the book cultivation will be.</p><p></p><p>The ink sources of Han Yue, Ye Xiaoxiao, and Xiao Fan were currently in their initial state, extremely small, precisely because they had not yet refined the book qi into it.</p><p></p><p>"The attack methods of book cultivation mostly rely on the ink source, so you must diligently cultivate. Furthermore, whether it's the Mysterious Brush, the Spiritual Brocade, or the Heaven and Earth Unification Diagram, they all require a robust ink source for you to be able to wield them."</p><p></p><p>Lü Changsheng said calmly.</p><p></p><p>"Yes, teacher!" The three of them responded quickly.</p><p></p><p>Lü Changsheng nodded, sat down in his seat, and said, "The realms of book cultivation are quite simple, with only five major realms."</p><p></p><p>Han Yue, Ye Xiaoxiao, and Xiao Fan perked up, listening attentively. At the same time, they looked at the young man with a slightly dazed gaze - it was as if they had also become book cultivators and were officially beginning their cultivation, all of it like a dream.</p><p></p><p>Lü Changsheng continued:</p><p></p><p>"The Mortal Book Realm is when the ink source is the size of a container, and the protective brush is no more than ten zhang tall.</p><p></p><p>The Mysterious Book Realm is when the ink source is the size of a pool, and the protective brush exceeds ten zhang.</p><p></p><p>The Earth Book Realm is when the ink source is the size of a river, and the protective brush exceeds a hundred zhang.</p><p></p><p>The Heavenly Book Realm is when the ink source is the size of an ocean, and the protective brush exceeds a thousand zhang.</p><p></p><p>The Saint Realm is when the ink source is crystallized, and the protective brush exceeds ten thousand zhang."</p><p></p><p>Mortal Book Realm, Mysterious Book Realm, Earth Book Realm, Heavenly Book Realm, Saint Realm!</p><p></p><p>Han Yue, Ye Xiaoxiao, and Xiao Fan's gazes were burning with intensity, their breathing quickened.</p><p></p><p>So powerful!</p><p></p><p>"Teacher, does that mean Master Lü, Master Mo, and Master Zui are already at the Saint Realm?" Han Yue asked with a flushed face.</p><p></p><p>Ye Xiaoxiao and Xiao Fan also listened intently, as they had just seen Master Lü and Master Mo the day before.</p><p></p><p>"Yes, but they are no longer ordinary Saints, but the three Heavenly and Earthly Saints."</p><p></p><p>Lü Changsheng smiled, but did not elaborate further.</p><p></p><p>Han Yue, Ye Xiaoxiao, and Xiao Fan naturally did not dare to ask more, but they now knew the extraordinary status of the three Masters.</p><p></p><p>Ye Xiaoxiao suddenly asked curiously, "Teacher, we now know about the ink source, but what is the protective brush?"</p><p></p><p>Han Yue and Xiao Fan were also curious.</p><p></p><p>"The protective brush is both offensive and defensive, and as important as the ink source. If the ink source is the core power stored in book cultivation, then the protective brush is the medium through which the book qi is unleashed in battle. The size of the protective brush also symbolizes one's strength."</p><p></p><p>After Lü Changsheng's explanation, Han Yue, Ye Xiaoxiao, and Xiao Fan fell into contemplation.</p><p></p><p>Now that they had the ink source, how could they also see their protective brushes?</p><p></p><p>"Just focus on your cultivation, and when you have absorbed the book qi, you will naturally be able to see your protective brushes."</p><p></p><p>Here is the full English translation of the Chinese excerpt:</p><p></p><p>"As for the protective writing brushes, you don't need to consider them for now," Lu Changsheng said calmly.</p><p></p><p>"Yes, Master!" Han Yue and the other two hurriedly responded.</p><p></p><p>Afterwards, Lu Changsheng mentioned a few more points to pay attention to, and before they knew it, it was noon.</p><p></p><p>"Alright, that's it for today's lesson. In the next few days, you should first absorb the book's qi to strengthen your ink source. Until then, I don't have anything else to teach you."</p><p></p><p>Lu Changsheng stood up and stretched, then continued, "You should follow me to have lunch first, and then quickly return to the academy's backyard for self-cultivation."</p><p></p><p>"Yes."</p><p></p><p>Han Yue and the other two quickly stood up.</p><p></p><p>Afterwards, the three little ones followed behind Lu Changsheng as they left the academy.</p><p></p><p>They all had money from their parents, and usually went to the streets to have lunch on their own during midday.</p><p></p><p>...</p><p></p><p>At the same time, the Dao Yan Sect was shocked and furious after learning that the group of elders and disciples they had sent to Jixiang Town had been killed.</p><p></p><p>In this Star Luo Empire, apart from the Tian Wu Sect, who else would dare to lay a hand on their Dao Yan Sect's people?</p><p></p><p>Moreover, the strength of the Fifth Elder was not weak at all!</p><p></p><p>They must have run into people from the Tian Wu Sect in Jixiang Town, and due to the eruption of the Earth Vein, the two sides immediately engaged in combat!</p><p></p><p>The speculation about the sequence of events was extremely clear in the minds of the Dao Yan Sect members!</p><p></p><p>They felt that it was almost certainly the case!</p><p></p><p>It's just that no matter how much they thought about it, and even if they wanted to take action, how dare the Tian Wu Sect commit murder?!</p><p></p><p>"Bang!"</p><p></p><p>Yin Quanwu suddenly crushed the armrest of his seat, standing up with a gloomy expression and shouting:</p><p></p><p>"Good Tian Wu Sect!! They actually dared to kill ruthlessly, even though the Earth Vein belongs to those with the right affinity!"</p><p></p><p>As Yin Quan's words fell, many of the elders in the hall stood up, filled with indignation:</p><p></p><p>"Sect Master! The Fifth Elder cannot die in vain, we must settle this account with the Tian Wu Sect!"</p><p></p><p>"Sect Master, once this matter is known to other sects, they will surely mock us for having a core elder killed by the Tian Wu Sect in secret!"</p><p></p><p>"Does the Tian Wu Sect really think they are the number one sect in Star Luo? Sect Master, the Fifth Elder has been diligently serving the sect, we must avenge him!"</p><p></p><p>"......"</p><p></p><p>Yin Quan's anger also grew deeper. The Tian Wu Sect was simply arrogant and didn't even consider the Dao Yan Sect at all!</p><p></p><p>Yin Quan took a deep breath and said in a stern voice, "Great Elder, you must quickly go to Jixiang Town to investigate the details of the incident. If it is truly as we have guessed, then this time, we Dao Yan Sect will... fight the Tian Wu Sect to the death!"</p><p></p><p>The elders were stunned!</p><p></p><p>Huh? Sect Master, are you serious?</p><p></p><p>We were just venting our anger, not really meaning it!</p><p></p><p>You directly said "fight to the death", is it true or false?</p><p></p><p>Although our Dao Yan Sect is not weak, we still have a gap compared to the Tian Wu Sect!</p><p></p><p>"Sect Master, we know you are angry, and we are also angry, but at this time, you must maintain rationality and consider the overall situation of the sect. Otherwise... we should first sit down and talk with the Tian Wu Sect."</p><p></p><p>"Yes, Sect Master, this matter still needs to be carefully considered. We should first negotiate the compensation issue with the Tian Wu Sect."</p><p></p><p>The elders said anxiously.</p><p></p><p>"Hmph!" Yin Quan snorted coldly and waved his hand, "You don't need to say anymore! Great Elder, hurry up and go. As long as it is confirmed to be the Tian Wu Sect, this time, even if it means the destruction of our sect, this Sect Master will make the Tian Wu Sect suffer heavy losses!"</p><p></p><p>"Yes..."</p><p></p><p>The Great Elder reluctantly agreed, then flashed out of the sect.</p><p></p><p>The elders looked at each other, all seeing the tension and unease in each other's eyes.</p><p></p><p>Yin Quan naturally saw this scene, and he sneered inwardly.</p><p></p><p>These bastards, they always put pressure on me, and every day they just act. Today, I'll also make you nervous!</p><p></p><p>As the head of a sect, Yin Quan was naturally not stupid. If it was really the Tian Wu Sect that killed the Fifth Elder, he would not be reckless in the short term for the sake of the sect's interests. He needed to consider it carefully.</p><p></p><p>The most important thing was that Yin Quan felt there was a hidden story.</p><p></p><p>He really couldn't understand why the Tian Wu Sect would dare to kill their Dao Yan Sect elder, even if they were the number one martial arts sect in Star Luo.</p><p></p><p>Thinking about this, Yin Quan's eyes flickered, wondering what exactly had happened... He felt that something was not quite right.</p>

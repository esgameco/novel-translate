        <h1>Chapter 137</h1>
        <div class="content">
            <p>Here is the full English translation of the Chinese excerpt:</p><p></p><p>On the wooden bridge,</p><p></p><p>Lu Changsheng walked to the end, but he still did not step onto the cliff. ‚ô¨üí¢Ôºñ‚ûà≈û‚ìó‡∏¢À£.Âåöùì∏ùïÑüíò‚ôß</p><p></p><p>Behind him, Old Turtle and the others saw this and were delighted in their hearts.</p><p></p><p>"You, why did you stop?"</p><p></p><p>"Come over quickly, the wind is strong, and the wooden bridge is swaying dangerously!"</p><p></p><p>"Come over quickly, we'll be at our Snowball Tribe soon!"</p><p></p><p>"Our Snowball Tribe is so much fun! Hurry up!"</p><p></p><p>The four snowmen saw that Lu Changsheng had suddenly stopped in his tracks, and they anxiously called out.</p><p></p><p>Lu Changsheng stood with his hands behind his back and looked at them with a faint smile. "Why have you suddenly become so enthusiastic?"</p><p></p><p>"......" The four snowmen felt a little embarrassed upon hearing this.</p><p></p><p>One snowman said, "If you guys don't come up, then we won't take you with us, and we'll go back to the tribe on our own~"</p><p></p><p>Saying this, the four snowmen started moving forward, glancing back as they went, and seeing that Lu Changsheng and the others still hadn't budged, they couldn't hold back their impatience!</p><p></p><p>No, they couldn't just leave like this, they had to regain the upper hand!</p><p></p><p>They had to teach these people a lesson!</p><p></p><p>Thinking this, the four snowmen returned to their original spot.</p><p></p><p>"Please, please come over!!"</p><p></p><p>"Are you suspecting that we're playing tricks? I promise we have no ill intentions!"</p><p></p><p>"Yes, come up quickly, there are really no restrictions here."</p><p></p><p>"......"</p><p></p><p>The voice suddenly stopped, and the three snowmen looked blankly at one of them.</p><p></p><p>Their eyes seemed to be saying, what are you blurting out the truth for?</p><p></p><p>That snowman also seemed to realize that he had misspoken and was a bit flustered.</p><p></p><p>"Since there are no restrictions, then we'll come up. We thought there were restrictions here, so we didn't dare come up. But if it's safe, then we'll come up."</p><p></p><p>Lu Changsheng chuckled lightly and took a step forward onto the cliff.</p><p></p><p>Old Turtle and the others also followed with smiles on their faces.</p><p></p><p>The four snowmen stared blankly at Lu Changsheng, and then their hearts were filled with joy!!</p><p></p><p>They had thought that upon hearing about the restrictions, the other side wouldn't dare come up to the cliff anymore,</p><p></p><p>Haha, they never expected there to be such idiots in this world!</p><p></p><p>Just then, one of the snowmen stomped the ground hard!</p><p></p><p>Hum hum hum‚Äî</p><p></p><p>Suddenly, countless threads appeared faintly in the air all around.</p><p></p><p>Old Turtle and the others clearly felt a force descending upon them, but they could withstand it.</p><p></p><p>As for Lu Changsheng, he didn't feel anything at all.</p><p></p><p>"Hahaha!! You fools, you've fallen into our trap! You can't move now, can you!" </p><p></p><p>The four snowmen laughed heartily, extremely pleased with themselves.</p><p></p><p>"Old Turtle, cooperate with them," Lu Changsheng transmitted telepathically with his hands behind his back, standing still.</p><p></p><p>Old Turtle was startled for a moment, then inwardly chuckled, pretending to be a pig to eat the tiger, which was something he was very good at.</p><p></p><p>Afterwards, he changed his expression to one of panic and growled, "How, how is this possible? We can't move at all, what have you done to us? Could it be that there really are restrictions here?!"</p><p></p><p>The four snowmen laughed even more joyfully at this, "Haha haha!"</p><p></p><p>At this moment, Lu Changsheng suddenly took a step forward.</p><p></p><p>Crack?</p><p></p><p>The laughter of the four snowmen abruptly stopped! They stared at Lu Changsheng in disbelief and trembled, "You, how are you still able to move?"</p><p></p><p>Lu Changsheng said indifferently, "This restriction is not bad."</p><p></p><p>As he spoke, he lightly tapped the ground with his toes.</p><p></p><p>Crack crack crack crack crack crack......</p><p></p><p>The restriction in this space instantly shattered into pieces!</p><p></p><p>The four snowmen were dumbfounded, their bodies trembling with fear!</p><p></p><p>"We, we... didn't mean to."</p><p></p><p>Just then,</p><p></p><p>A large snowman appeared in this place.</p><p></p><p>"Uncle Tribe Leader!!"</p><p></p><p>The four snowmen immediately burst into tears, as if they had found their backbone.</p><p></p><p>The Snow Tower looked around at the shattered remnants of the restriction and finally swept his gaze over the people in front of him.</p><p></p><p>Here is the full English translation of the Chinese excerpt:</p><p></p><p>The gaze finally settled on Lu Changsheng.</p><p></p><p>The new 69 book bar 99 sxnx¬∑oom</p><p></p><p>His eyes were filled with solemnity.</p><p></p><p>Chu Lingian and the others were also shocked to see the giant snowman in front of them, and they sensed a hint of threat from it.</p><p></p><p>This giant snowman was actually a Xian Emperor-level expert!!</p><p></p><p>"I am Snow Tower of the Snow Ball Tribe. May I ask what brings you to our Snow Ball Tribe territory?" </p><p></p><p>Snow Tower asked solemnly.</p><p></p><p>He did not act rashly, because the people in front of him... were very strong.</p><p></p><p>Especially the leading man in blue, whom he could not see through at all!</p><p></p><p>But judging from their positioning, the man in blue was undoubtedly the leader of this group.</p><p></p><p>Old Gui and the others looked towards Lu Changsheng upon hearing this.</p><p></p><p>Lu Changsheng looked at Snow Tower and said softly, "I've heard that your Snow Ball Tribe also has ancestors serving in the Ancestral Celestial Realm. I've come to ask, what are your views on the current Shen Path?"</p><p></p><p>Snow Tower's eyes beneath the fluffy fur suddenly changed!</p><p></p><p>He was silent for a moment, then said in a deep voice, "Gentlemen, it's cold outside. Why don't you come to our tribe and we can discuss this further."</p><p></p><p>"Tribal Uncle!!"</p><p></p><p>The four snowmen looked at Snow Tower in disbelief, not understanding why he would bring these bad people back to the tribe.</p><p></p><p>Lu Changsheng waved his hand slightly, and the ropes on the four snowmen disappeared. He smiled and said, "Alright."</p><p></p><p>.........</p><p></p><p>Lu Changsheng and the others followed Snow Tower to the peak of a snow mountain, where there was a hidden entrance.</p><p></p><p>"Gentlemen, this is the entrance to our Snow Ball Tribe. Please come in."</p><p></p><p>As soon as Snow Tower finished speaking, the four snowmen beside him playfully rushed in first.</p><p></p><p>"Wuhu, back home!"</p><p></p><p>Seeing this, Snow Tower angrily shouted, "You little rascals, how rude!"</p><p></p><p>He then looked at Lu Changsheng and smiled, "Apologies, gentlemen."</p><p></p><p>"No problem." Lu Changsheng waved his hand, then he and Old Gui stepped in.</p><p></p><p>As soon as they entered the cave, the howling wind sound immediately disappeared, and a spacious and bright scene appeared before them.</p><p></p><p>Numerous orderly buildings stood tall, and laughter and playful sounds came from all around.</p><p></p><p>Snow people of various sizes were coming and going.</p><p></p><p>The snow people curiously looked at Lu Changsheng and the others, as they had already heard that these were the Four Treasures encountered in the outside world.</p><p></p><p>"What are you all doing? Mind your own business!" </p><p></p><p>Snow Tower frowned and drove away the snow people who were gawking, then looked at Lu Changsheng and said, "Gentlemen, please follow me to the Tribal Altar. Our Snow Ball Tribe's Patriarch is there."</p><p></p><p>.......</p><p></p><p>"Snow Tower, you're back. What's the deal with the restriction..."</p><p></p><p>A fluffy, pale yellow snow person had not finished speaking when he suddenly paused.</p><p></p><p>Seeing this, Snow Tower quickly introduced, "Patriarch, it's like this. They are..."</p><p></p><p>He then told the Snow Ball Tribe Patriarch about the Four Treasures, the restriction, and the Shen Path.</p><p></p><p>"Oh? You've come to our Snow Ball Tribe regarding the Shen Path?" The Snow Ball Tribe Patriarch became serious.</p><p></p><p>Lu Changsheng said, "That's right. I suppose your Snow Ball Tribe has also been obstructed from ascending to the Ancestral Celestial Realm because of the Shen Path?"</p><p></p><p>As he spoke, Lu Changsheng glanced at the silent Snow Tower, the meaning implicit.</p><p></p><p>The Snow Ball Tribe Patriarch looked at the silent Snow Tower, then said, "Gentlemen, are you proposing an alliance with our Snow Ball Tribe? What are the conditions?"</p><p></p><p>"No conditions. It's not really an alliance either. I'm just being nosy and want to help you all ascend as well." Lu Changsheng chuckled lightly.</p><p></p><p>The Snow Ball Tribe Patriarch and Snow Tower exchanged a glance, then hesitantly said, "Gentlemen, do you know that those obstructing the Shen Path are all powerful experts from the Ancestral Celestial Realm? Do you think with our Snow Ball Tribe added, we can break through it?"</p><p></p><p>Lu Changsheng waved his hand, "That's not quite right. Breaking through the Shen Path, I alone would be enough."</p>

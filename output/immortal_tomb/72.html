        <h1>Chapter 72</h1>
        <div class="content">
            <p>Here is the full English translation of the Chinese excerpt:</p><p></p><p>The old turtle came back a bit, hearing the words of Gu Helin, and unconsciously opened his mouth wanting to speak, but swallowed it back down.</p><p></p><p>He had just been slapped by Lu Changsheng, so it was better to be obedient for the time being.</p><p></p><p>He then tightly closed his mouth, maintaining a polite yet lecherous smile on his face.</p><p></p><p>"Come in," Lu Changsheng said, then stepped over the threshold.</p><p></p><p>"Senior Turtle, let's go in as well," Gu Helin said softly, supporting the old turtle.</p><p></p><p>"Tch, who needs your support? Your grandpa turtle isn't unsteady on his feet!" The old turtle quickly withdrew his hand and then strode in arrogantly.</p><p></p><p>Gu Helin had a bitter smile on his face. </p><p>The master had hit Senior Turtle, and now Senior Turtle was taking it out on him, a small fry... Ah, it's too difficult.</p><p></p><p>In the restaurant.</p><p>The scenery was lofty and the water was long, with a misty haze, a tranquil environment, and the gentle sound of the guqin music entering the ears, creating a unique world.</p><p></p><p>Gu Helin introduced, "Master, this restaurant has formations set up, so..."</p><p>Before he could finish, the old turtle spat out, "Nonsense, you brat already know, does the host not know?"</p><p>He then looked at Lu Changsheng and laughed foolishly, "Hehe, isn't that right, host?"</p><p></p><p>At this moment, two graceful figures became increasingly clear in the mist, soon arriving in front of the three.</p><p></p><p>"Honored guests, you are truly fortunate, as there is still one spot left in the restaurant. Please follow us~"</p><p>The two female cultivators said with sweet smiles, then turned and led the way.</p><p></p><p>"Hehe, these two little female cultivators, not bad looking," the old turtle commented, staring at their retreating figures.</p><p></p><p>Gu Helin forced a smile and said, "Master, please."</p><p>The three then followed after them.</p><p></p><p>Soon, Lu Changsheng and the others followed the two female cultivators to a lake, boarded a bamboo raft, and drifted to the pavilion in the middle of the lake.</p><p></p><p>In the pavilion.</p><p>"What would you three honored guests like?" the female cultivator asked with a smile, her gaze mainly on Lu Changsheng.</p><p>She could tell that Lu Changsheng was the core figure among the three, and looking at a youthful and well-preserved gentleman was more pleasant than looking at two dried-up old men.</p><p></p><p>Gu Helin glanced at Lu Changsheng and smiled, "Miss, we've come to your restaurant naturally for that 'Spring Breeze for Ten Miles' brew."</p><p></p><p>The female cultivator understood, and with a sweep of her sleeve, several wine jars appeared on the table.</p><p>A light fragrance of alcohol permeated the cool pavilion.</p><p></p><p>The old turtle twitched his nose, indifferent, not opposing nor loving alcohol - he liked lust but not wine.</p><p></p><p>"Please take your time, we'll go prepare some dishes," the female cultivator smiled and was about to call the other one to leave.</p><p></p><p>Suddenly, the old turtle grabbed the hand of the female cultivator in front of him!</p><p>Instantly, everyone except Lu Changsheng was startled!</p><p></p><p>The female cultivator turned around, looked at her hand that was gripped, then looked up and directly at the old turtle, suppressing the indignation in her heart and asking in a restrained voice, "Sir, what is the meaning of this?"</p><p></p><p>The old turtle glanced at Lu Changsheng out of the corner of his eye, cleared his throat, and reluctantly withdrew his hand, smiling, "As for the dishes, just one of you needs to go, the other can stay, we have some things to ask."</p><p></p><p>Seeing him withdraw his hand, the female cultivator's heart eased a bit, and the smile returned to her face. She turned to signal the other female cultivator, and after that one left, she turned back and said with a smile, "Sir, you should have said so earlier. I was just startled, thinking we had failed to accommodate you properly."</p><p></p><p>The old turtle narrowed his eyes and looked at her, saying, "How could we not be accommodated properly? I was just grabbing you, purely to ask about the sign on your restaurant, otherwise why would I, Grandpa Turtle, a proper gentleman, do that, right Helin?"</p><p>He suddenly looked over at Gu Helin.</p><p></p><p>Here is the full English translation of the Chinese excerpt:</p><p></p><p>He did not dare ask Lu Changsheng such a question.</p><p></p><p>Ancient Crane Lin's movements in pouring wine for Lu Changsheng paused, and he hurriedly nodded in agreement: "Ah yes, yes, that's right, Senior Turtle is naturally an upright gentleman."</p><p></p><p>The female cultivator believed it, and her mind was completely relaxed.</p><p></p><p>This white-bearded old man had a kind expression, and he looked like an upright person. Since he said that the hunchbacked old man was an upright gentleman, then he must be.</p><p></p><p>"I see, guest, are you hoping to nominate the plaque for our establishment?" the female cultivator asked with a smile.</p><p></p><p>"No, we don't want to nominate the plaque, but rather we want to meet the behind-the-scenes owner of this restaurant," the old turtle said.</p><p></p><p>Let him nominate the owner? This small restaurant is not worthy of the nomination from the Immortal Emperor. As far as he was concerned, the restaurant owner should obediently offer up that peerless fine wine.</p><p></p><p>"Uh, honored guests, I'm afraid our master never shows his face, unless the plaque has been successfully nominated," the female cultivator said apologetically, but she was already a bit impatient.</p><p></p><p>One look at these people, and it was clear they didn't have the ability to nominate, yet they still wanted to see the master directly... It was simply absurd.</p><p></p><p>Even the former Patriarch of the Purple Extreme Thunder Peak, Jiang Yuan, was unable to nominate the plaque and tried to see the master directly based on his post-tribulation cultivation, but afterwards, she didn't know what happened, and he left in a disheveled state.</p><p></p><p>This matter was only known to the insiders of their restaurant.</p><p></p><p>If it were to be spread out, it would undoubtedly cause a huge commotion in the cultivation world.</p><p></p><p>"Haha, not showing his face? That's quite a big deal," the old turtle mocked with a laugh. "Alright, Grandpa Turtle shall ask you, is your master currently in the restaurant? You can at least tell us that, right?"</p><p></p><p>The female cultivator's expression changed slightly, and she said in a stern voice, "What are you trying to do? I advise you not to cause trouble in our restaurant!"</p><p></p><p>Ancient Crane Lin's expression changed as well, and he instinctively glanced at Lu Changsheng, who was quietly drinking his wine.</p><p></p><p>"Your words are too harsh. We just want to see your master, how is that causing trouble? Haha... It seems he is here, since you have such a big face, then let Grandpa Turtle summon him out!"</p><p></p><p>The old turtle finished speaking and suddenly waved his sleeve!</p><p></p><p>Boom!</p><p></p><p>The mountain and water formation set up in the restaurant suddenly began to tremble!</p><p></p><p>Many cultivators drinking in other areas all had their expressions change, but the trembling quickly subsided.</p><p></p><p>They were all puzzled, not knowing what had happened.</p><p></p><p>At the same time, in the pavilion where Lu Changsheng and the others were,</p><p>a white-robed graceful figure materialized.</p><p></p><p>Her figure was slender, with a light veil covering her face, and her fair skin made one want to take a bite. But at the moment, the moist eyes looking at the old turtle contained a sense of shock and... a hint of surprise and disbelief.</p><p></p><p>"Master! " the female cultivator exclaimed, quickly bowing down.</p><p></p><p>Ancient Crane Lin was also stunned as he looked at the white-robed lady. So this was the behind-the-scenes master of the Nameless Restaurant? Today, by following the senior and Turtle Senior, he had indeed gained some new insights.</p><p></p><p>The white-robed lady suppressed the emotions in her eyes and looked at the old turtle, calmly saying, "Sir, why are you causing a disturbance in my restaurant without reason?"</p><p></p><p>The old turtle cautiously glanced at the self-drinking Lu Changsheng out of the corner of his eye, then looked at the white-robed lady with a meaningful squint and smiled, "Well, I didn't expect the behind-the-scenes master of this restaurant to be such a beauty?"</p><p></p><p>The white-robed lady did not show any impatience, but instead spoke again, "Sir, you have not answered, why are you causing a disturbance in my restaurant without reason?"</p><p></p><p>The old turtle slowly stood up, stroking his beard proudly:</p><p></p><p>"What reason? I, Grandpa Turtle, have great power and can do as I please. It's as simple as that."</p><p></p><p>Lu Changsheng raised his eyebrows slightly, and then heard the old turtle hurriedly and awkwardly laugh, "Except... except for the master!!"</p>

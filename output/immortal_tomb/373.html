        <h1>Chapter 373</h1>
        <div class="content">
            <p>Here is the full English translation of the Chinese excerpt:</p><p></p><p>The Human Realm. ðŸŽ‰The land was filled with a bustling crowd.</p><p></p><p>Outside the human city, there were people as far as the eye could see.</p><p></p><p>It had always been this way, with everyone gathering at the appointed time when the Seven-Colored Jade Pagoda's event would end, arriving early to wait.</p><p></p><p>In the sky above, Jian Wuhui, Man Tian, and Yan Jueyi stood with smiles on their faces.</p><p></p><p>They had a premonition that the humans' harvest this time should be quite good.</p><p></p><p>Obtaining three or even four Jade Hearts should not be a problem.</p><p></p><p>As for the three human lords below, they were accompanied by several Shenxuan Realm cultivators and Shenyou Realm cultivators, all with expressions full of anticipation.</p><p></p><p>Suddenly, a golden light flashed in the distant battle haze!</p><p></p><p>Immediately, the area outside the human city became restless, with many cultivators waving their hands excitedly and full of expectation.</p><p></p><p>"Hehe, it seems that Feng Xing and Jin Lun Wang have finally returned," Manten said with a smile as he rubbed his hands together.</p><p></p><p>Soon, the full form of the Scorching Sun Celestial Wheel appeared in everyone's vision.</p><p></p><p>"Hmm?" Jian Wuhui suddenly furrowed his brow slightly, his gaze puzzled.</p><p></p><p>Noticing this, Yan Jueyi asked in surprise, "Lord Jian, is there something amiss?"</p><p></p><p>Jian Wuhui spoke softly, "Lu Xiaoyou is not on the Scorching Sun Celestial Wheel."</p><p></p><p>Oh?</p><p></p><p>Hearing this, Manten and Yan Jueyi focused their attention and indeed saw that one person was missing.</p><p></p><p>Twelve people had left, but only eleven had returned.</p><p></p><p>At that moment, the Scorching Sun Celestial Wheel finally arrived outside the human city amidst the enthusiastic cheers.</p><p></p><p>But the cheers soon grew weaker and weaker...</p><p></p><p>The raised arms of the cultivators also slowly fell...</p><p></p><p>The expressions on everyone's faces changed from joy to bewilderment and confusion, and a sense of foreboding arose in their hearts.</p><p></p><p>Because everyone could clearly see that Feng Xing, Jin Lun Wang, Fang Yin, and the others had no smiles on their faces.</p><p></p><p>Could it be... that the results from the Seven-Colored Jade Pagoda were dismal this time?</p><p></p><p>It seemed that this was the only possible explanation.</p><p></p><p>So how many Jade Hearts were obtained? Three, two, one, or... none at all?</p><p></p><p>The group from the Xiaoyao Sect who had come specifically to welcome their sect master Lu Changsheng back were exchanging bewildered glances.</p><p></p><p>Where was the sect master?</p><p></p><p>"Huh, where did the master go?" the old turtle asked, puzzled.</p><p></p><p>Beside him, Li Shuoyan, Tong Xin, Lin Dong, Peng Fang, and the others shook their heads in confusion, also wondering the same thing.</p><p></p><p>At this time, Han Jinlong, Jiang Wuxin, and the others descended from the Scorching Sun Celestial Wheel.</p><p></p><p>They all came before Jian Wuhui, Manten, and Yan Jueyi.</p><p></p><p>"Lord Jian, we... have returned," Han Jinlong and Jiang Wuxin sighed as they slightly bowed.</p><p></p><p>Fang Yin, Mo Liangqiu, and the others behind them also deeply bent over, not daring to utter a word.</p><p></p><p>Jian Wuhui and Manten Yan Jueyi exchanged a glance, their expressions inscrutable.</p><p></p><p>They had sensed something was amiss earlier.</p><p></p><p>"Where is Lu Xiaoyou?" Jian Wuhui asked in a calm voice, not asking about the harvest first, but about Lu Changsheng's whereabouts.</p><p></p><p>A deathly silence fell upon the scene, and all the cultivators perked up their ears to listen to the conversation between the human lords.</p><p></p><p>After Jian Wuhui's question, the cultivators finally realized that someone was missing - the young man in green robes whom even the Lord Jian had treated politely.</p><p></p><p>At this moment, the old turtle and the others were also listening intently.</p><p></p><p>Jiang Wuxin glanced at Han Jinlong and then spoke in a somber tone, "Lord Jian, Changsheng has... been trapped inside the Seven-Colored Jade Pagoda."</p><p></p><p>What?!</p><p></p><p>Everyone present was utterly shocked!</p><p></p><p>Even the three human lords, Jian Wuhui, Manten, and Yan Jueyi, had their pupils contract in surprise.</p><p></p><p>"Feng Xing, quickly tell this lord what exactly happened in the Seven-Colored Jade Pagoda!" Jian Wuhui demanded in a low voice.</p><p></p><p>Jian Wuhui's stern shout caused everyone present to tremble.</p><p></p><p>Jiang Wuxin took a deep breath and said with great difficulty:</p><p></p><p>"Inside the Seven-Colored Jade Pagoda, Changsheng shocked all the tribes, slaying thousands of Shenxuan Realm cultivators, including the Holy Son of the Yousha Tribe..."</p><p></p><p>"This time...</p><p></p><p>Here is the full English translation of the Chinese excerpt:</p><p></p><p>"The Jade Heart in total amounts to sixteen thousand six hundred and sixty-six pieces..." </p><p></p><p>The new 69 book bar 99 SHUX.COM</p><p></p><p>"All of it is in the hands of our human race..."</p><p></p><p>Boom!!!</p><p></p><p>Jiang Wuxin's hurried words fell, as if a savage thunderclap had exploded in everyone's ears!!</p><p></p><p>The minds of the cultivators were also stirred up by towering waves!!</p><p></p><p>Their expressions became stunned, and then their heartbeats quickened like the beating of drums!!</p><p></p><p>Slaughtering thousands of divine and mysterious cultivators of the Yousha Clan's holy son...</p><p></p><p>Sixteen thousand six hundred and sixty-six Jade Hearts???? </p><p></p><p>This...</p><p></p><p>The cultivators' emotions first turned bewildered, then shocked and delighted, and finally... transformed into terror and a glimmer of hope!!</p><p></p><p>They even hoped that Fengxing was joking, because if everything was true, then the human race would face a catastrophic disaster!</p><p></p><p>At this moment, Fang Yin suddenly waved his sleeve!</p><p></p><p>The next moment, countless jade stones glowing with blue and purple light floated in the sky, exquisitely beautiful!</p><p></p><p>Any one of them would have a fatal attraction to cultivators at the late Divine Dao Realm!</p><p></p><p>Jade Hearts!!</p><p></p><p>The crowd looked at the Jade Hearts in the sky with shock, and after a quick scan, there were exactly sixteen thousand six hundred and sixty-six of them...</p><p></p><p>So, Lord Fengxing was not joking earlier!</p><p></p><p>The sky outside the human city was deathly silent, and their minds all conjured up the image of the young man in blue robes named Lu Changsheng...</p><p></p><p>Just how did that senior manage to do this?</p><p></p><p>Normally, a single Jade Heart is extremely precious, but now so many have appeared before their eyes.</p><p></p><p>It's clear that the impact was tremendous!</p><p></p><p>At this time, even Old Turtle and Tong Xin were stunned.</p><p></p><p>They knew that Lu Changsheng's actions were not simple, but they never imagined that he would leave not even a drop of soup for the myriad clans...</p><p></p><p>Aside from the great Patriarch, they could hardly imagine anyone else in this world with the courage to do such a thing.</p><p></p><p>The Patriarch is awesome!</p><p></p><p>Peng Fang and the others had excited expressions, eagerly eyeing the Jade Hearts in the sky, wanting to rush out and grab a few, which would be quite reasonable.</p><p></p><p>However, the atmosphere here doesn't seem quite appropriate.</p><p></p><p>Jian Wuhui and the others snapped back to their senses, their Adam's apples quickly bobbing up and down, directly feeling an unusual dryness in their throats.</p><p></p><p>After a moment, Jian Wuhui revealed a wry smile, then his expression became solemn as he shouted the order throughout the human domain:</p><p></p><p>"From this moment on, all personnel are to gather in the Heaven, Earth, and Human Three Cities, and prepare for an all-out war!!!"</p><p></p><p>"Cultivators at the Divine Mysterious Realm and above, come to the Patriarch's Palace in the Human City!"</p><p></p><p>After saying this, he waved his hand to collect all the Jade Hearts, and he and the four human lords headed towards the main palace in the Human City!</p><p></p><p>Next, they would hold an emergency meeting!</p><p></p><p>Outside the Human City, the cultivators retreated like the tide, orderly and calm.</p><p></p><p>Some directly entered the Human City, while others headed towards the Heaven City and Earth City!</p><p></p><p>Everyone knew the seriousness of the situation, and the challenge the human race was facing this time could be described as legendary!</p><p></p><p>No one blamed Lu Changsheng for this, and many cultivators even felt satisfied and relieved.</p><p></p><p>The human race had shown weakness for many years, but this time they had forcefully seized all the Jade Hearts, boldly revealing their might.</p><p></p><p>They knew the human race would face great danger ahead, but they believed the five human lords would make the right decisions.</p><p></p><p>They only needed to, follow orders.</p><p></p><p>Even if it meant death, they would not hesitate!</p><p></p><p>...</p><p></p><p>At the same time, inside the Great Dao Demon-Subduing Tower.</p><p></p><p>Lu Changsheng was seriously breaking the dense chains, occasionally making a loud crashing sound as one after another was severed.</p><p></p><p>The strange-faced child was now tearfully pleading, "Big Brother, if you can really save me, I'll be your ox and horse..."</p><p></p><p>Slap!</p><p></p><p>Lu Changsheng didn't even turn his head, slapping the child's head from a distance.</p><p></p><p>The child immediately fell silent and lowered his head obediently.</p>

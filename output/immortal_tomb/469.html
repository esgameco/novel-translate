        <h1>Chapter 469</h1>
        <div class="content">
            <p>Here is my translation of the Chinese excerpt you provided:</p><p></p><p>"Haha, Lu Changsheng, are you afraid? To die under my Light Principle is an honor for you."</p><p></p><p>The man in the black robe sneered coldly, then slowly raised his hand and pointed at Lu Changsheng, saying indifferently:</p><p></p><p>"Light Principle, Annihilation Beam!"</p><p></p><p>Rumble!</p><p></p><p>The heavens and earth shook at that moment, and the space hummed as if under immense pressure!</p><p></p><p>Immediately, the terrifying light that covered the sky converged towards the center at the speed of light! Yes, the light actually moved like a liquid, converging!</p><p></p><p>This incredibly bizarre scene also shocked all living beings!</p><p></p><p>Soon, the terrifying light like an ocean condensed into a huge light column!</p><p></p><p>Why call it huge? Because all the living beings in the Qiankun Heavens could see it clearly!</p><p></p><p>This huge light column connected to unknown places, its length and width exceeding tens of thousands of miles!!</p><p></p><p>"It's moving!! "</p><p></p><p>A cry of terror from someone echoed.</p><p></p><p>In the sky above, the terrifying light column as a whole had not yet moved, but upon closer inspection, one could see that the countless rays of light condensed on the light column were flowing rapidly like water!</p><p></p><p>This meant that while the light column appeared stationary to the naked eye, it had actually started moving at a speed beyond comprehension!</p><p></p><p>In the Void Ancient Realm, the He Clan!</p><p></p><p>All the people looked fearfully at the huge light column that seemed to come from the outside, their bodies petrified.</p><p></p><p>They could imagine that when this light column arrived, the Void Ancient Realm might shatter in an instant!</p><p></p><p>Hung Wanjun, Ouyang Mo, and the others also had fear in their eyes, never having felt such despair before.</p><p></p><p>What an incredible power of the Principle!</p><p></p><p>Cultivating the Principle to this extent, able to directly inflict destructive damage on a world!</p><p></p><p>He Lian had woken up at some point, sitting there, looking up at the light column with a dazed and regretful gaze.</p><p></p><p>She... what kind of monster had she brought upon the He Clan...</p><p></p><p>"Boom... boom... boom..."</p><p></p><p>The terrifying light column, as if from ancient times, was filled with an overwhelming sense of oppression. At this moment, all things in the Void Ancient Realm seemed incredibly insignificant in the face of this light column!</p><p></p><p>"Haha haha, your weak world, if I didn't want to refine the Eternal Calamity Body, I could just snap my fingers and your world would collapse!!"</p><p></p><p>Seeing the light column about to arrive, the man in the black robe put away his gesture and laughed wildly.</p><p></p><p>But the man's laughter soon stopped, for he saw Lu Changsheng's indifferent expression.</p><p></p><p>The man in the black robe coldly said, "Lu Changsheng, I know your heart is panicked, afraid, just show it, don't suppress it in your heart... Don't worry, show it, I won't laugh at you haha haha!"</p><p></p><p>Towards the end, the man in the black robe couldn't help but laugh out loud.</p><p></p><p>Lu Changsheng looked at the man in the black robe indifferently, then suddenly turned around and looked up at the dazzling, terrifying light column.</p><p></p><p>Facing the terrifying light column, Lu Changsheng seemed extremely small, tiny to the extreme.</p><p></p><p>But the next moment, Ye Zhuiyue and the others were stunned to see a broken sword suddenly appear in Lu Changsheng's hand!</p><p></p><p>Elder Lu... what is he trying to do?</p><p></p><p>Hung Wanjun and the others were also extremely puzzled, their mouths curling into bitter smiles, thinking it was just the young man's dying struggle.</p><p></p><p>When the terrifying light column arrived, not only Lu Changsheng, but all of them would be extinguished in the light.</p><p></p><p>"Haha, Lu Changsheng, stop pretending. Can you really split open this Annihilation Beam? This is the Light Principle, light that can be seen but not touched!!" The man in the black robe sneered contemptuously.</p><p></p><p>Hearing this, Lu Changsheng remained expressionless. The next moment, he lightly swung the broken sword in his hand!!</p><p></p><p>"Clang--!"</p><p></p><p>As the shattering sword cries echoed throughout the Qiankun Heavens, as the shattering sword cries tore the eardrums of everyone,</p><p></p><p>As the sword broke through the sky, as the vast sword qi with the sharpest sword edges directly targeted the terrifying light beam...</p><p></p><p>The heart of the man in the black robe finally trembled violently!</p><p></p><p>The vast sword qi was like a vast ocean, wherever it passed, the space collapsed!</p><p></p><p>With a single sword, the Qiankun Heavens shook, and all things fell silent!</p><p></p><p>This sword's momentum was undefeatable!!</p><p></p><p>"Clang--!"</p><p></p><p>In the next instant, the entire sky-covering light column was easily torn apart by the sword qi, not even lasting a breath!</p><p></p><p>The moment the sky-covering light column was torn apart, the Qiankun Heavens suddenly changed from a bright day to a pitch-black night, utterly dark!</p><p></p><p>All was silent, only the surging sword qi remained in the sky.</p><p></p><p>Here is my translation of the Chinese excerpt:</p><p></p><p>The resounding sword cry as it sliced through the air caused the entire heavens to tremble!</p><p></p><p>The casual sword strike by Lu Changsheng was so fast that it surpassed the speed of light, leaving it far behind.</p><p></p><p>The sword energy pierced through the barriers of the heavens, transcending time, carrying endless sharpness. It slew gods and Buddhas alike, soon disappearing into the boundless void.</p><p></p><p>...</p><p></p><p>In a certain place, the weather was fine and the sky was clear.</p><p></p><p>Suddenly, a thunderous sword cry erupted out of nowhere, instantly drawing countless bewildered gazes.</p><p></p><p>Many bewildered eyes hurriedly looked up to the sky, and were shocked to see a massive fissure had appeared in the heavens, spanning the entire sky!</p><p></p><p>This enormous fissure seemed to have been cleaved open by a single mighty sword strike.</p><p></p><p>"What, what is this? Why has a fissure suddenly appeared in the sky?"</p><p></p><p>"It must be related to that sword cry just now..."</p><p></p><p>"Whew, what a terrifying sword master must have struck that blow?"</p><p></p><p>"I think I've dreamed of a scene like this before... the Scar of the Heavens..."</p><p></p><p>"The Scar of the Heavens? That's not a bad name, let's call this world the Scar of the Heavens from now on, it fits perfectly!"</p><p></p><p>"Tch, 'fits perfectly'? Who knows if this fissure can even be repaired, looking at it just gives me the creeps..."</p><p></p><p>...</p><p></p><p>In the Qiankun Heavens.</p><p></p><p>As the fierce sword cry gradually faded away in the sky, the Qiankun Heavens slowly transitioned from night to day.</p><p></p><p>But the light was now gentle, no longer the terrifying pillar of light as before.</p><p></p><p>The world remained silent, but for some reason, everyone let out a sigh of relief.</p><p></p><p>And at this moment, in the Hollow Ancient Realm of the He Clan, the entire place was deathly quiet, countless trembling gazes fixed on the blue-robed man slowly sheathing his sword...</p><p></p><p>What kind of strike was that just now?</p><p></p><p>He had actually managed to block that terrifying pillar of light... no, not block it, but utterly crush it!</p><p></p><p>That destructive pillar of light was unable to withstand even a moment against the sword energy.</p><p></p><p>Ye Zhuiyue and the others were deathly pale, their breathing rapid as they stared at Lu Changsheng.</p><p></p><p>Gradually, gradually, fear began to grow in their hearts. They had been negligent, so negligent towards this Lu Laoer, this Lu Daren!</p><p></p><p>In the Extreme Refinement Formation, He Xitong's gaze was blank. The master... truly the most brilliant existence, no matter where he goes...</p><p></p><p>At this moment, Lu Changsheng suddenly turned his head, casting a cold, emotionless side-glance at the black-robed man.</p><p></p><p>This single glance caused the just-recovered black-robed man to tremble all over, slowly retreating.</p><p></p><p>"Lu Changsheng, you're impressive, but we'll meet again!"</p><p></p><p>The black-robed man said shakily, not even caring about He Xitong, the Eternal Calamity Body, as he fled the Qiankun Heavens.</p><p></p><p>Lu Changsheng's mouth curled in a cold smile as he suddenly raised his broken sword and hurled it!</p><p></p><p>The sword vanished in a flash, instantly piercing the black-robed man's chest and violently impaling him into the towering mountain cliff behind the He Clan!</p><p></p><p>Boom!</p><p></p><p>The entire mountain shook violently!</p><p></p><p>The black-robed man coughed up blood, trying to pull out the sword to no avail. He finally panicked:</p><p></p><p>"Lu Changsheng, what do you want? You can't provoke me, I can let bygones be bygones!"</p><p></p><p>Lu Changsheng looked at the still defiant black-robed man, the killing intent in his eyes gradually rising.</p><p></p><p>At this moment, the avatar of the Heavenly Dao appeared, causing Hongwanjun and everyone else to tremble.</p><p></p><p>"Lord Lu, may this person be handed over to the Heavenly Dao for judgment?" the Heavenly Dao avatar said in an uneasy tone.</p><p></p><p>Lu Changsheng gave it a brief glance and said, "That black-robed person's attack just now nearly dealt a heavy blow to your Qiankun Heavens... why didn't you come out then, and why are you coming out now?"</p><p></p><p>The Heavenly Dao avatar said in shame, "Lord Lu, the Heavenly Dao was previously unable to deal with him..."</p><p></p><p>Lu Changsheng's gaze suddenly turned icy, and he slapped the Heavenly Dao avatar, scattering it:</p><p></p><p>"Since you didn't come out before, then don't come out now and get in my way, you useless thing!"</p>

        <h1>Chapter 177</h1>
        <div class="content">
            <p>Here is my translation of the Chinese excerpt:</p><p></p><p>Jiang Wumang's face suddenly stiffened. He looked at Lu Changsheng from afar, giving a bitter smile, with a hint of regret in his eyes. The last remaining hilt in his hand then fell off, and his body in the longevity robe split into two and then disintegrated into nothingness.</p><p></p><p>The heavens and the earth were stunned, and everyone swallowed their saliva in shock. Even the Jiang Clan's venerable ancestor, despite unleashing such an overwhelming might, could not withstand the sword qi of the young man in blue for even a moment!</p><p></p><p>"Ancestor! Ancestor!!" </p><p></p><p>Jiang Wuji's expression changed drastically, and the scions of the Jiang Imperial Clan also had bloodshot eyes at that instant.</p><p></p><p>A desolate atmosphere permeated the heavens and the earth.</p><p></p><p>The azure sword qi continued to advance, heading towards the Jiang Imperial Clan!</p><p></p><p>"Shopkeeper! Vengeance's son is inside... can you..." </p><p></p><p>At this moment, Left Qishan could no longer hold back, and he knelt down in front of everyone, pleading desperately.</p><p></p><p>Seeing this, Left Qizi also knelt down, and the elders of the Tiansha Mansion followed suit, gradually connecting the dots and guessing what had happened.</p><p></p><p>"It's you... Left Hengzhi!!" </p><p></p><p>Jiang Wuji in the sky suddenly fixed his gaze on Left Qishan, his eyes filled with hatred. The accidental death of his daughter Jiang Xuan had always been a thorn in his heart, and he had piled all the blame on Left Qishan.</p><p></p><p>If it weren't for this presumptuous young man, his daughter would not have died!</p><p></p><p>The Jiang Imperial Clan's elders also reacted, but at the moment, they had no time to focus on this matter - their Jiang Imperial Clan was about to perish!</p><p></p><p>Jiang Zhou heard the shout and his heart suddenly jumped. He looked at Left Qishan with a confused expression.</p><p></p><p>What was going on...?</p><p></p><p>At this moment, everyone suddenly noticed that the speed of the azure sword qi in the sky had slowed down...</p><p></p><p>Peng Fang saw this, glanced at Left Qishan, and sighed softly. He stepped forward and looked at Jiang Zhou, speaking in a solemn tone:</p><p></p><p>"He is your biological father. Back then..."</p><p></p><p>Peng Fang quickly recounted the past events involving Left Qishan and the Jiang Imperial Clan.</p><p></p><p>Everyone in the heavens and earth was stunned, not expecting such a big secret to be hidden within.</p><p></p><p>Connecting the dots, they suddenly understood.</p><p></p><p>So that's why Jiang Chu and Jiang Chong appeared in the Black Sha Domain - they were actually searching for the Tiansha Mansion's master, Left Qishan!</p><p></p><p>It turned out that the Jiang Imperial Clan's princess was accidentally killed by her own father, Jiang Wuji...</p><p></p><p>Jiang Wuji's face turned black. He never expected that at the moment of the Jiang Imperial Clan's downfall, such an ugly secret would be exposed!</p><p></p><p>The heavens were unjust!</p><p></p><p>At this time, the old matriarch of the Jiang Clan, who had been silent all along, stepped forward and shouted: "It's you, daring to climb the high branches of our Jiang Imperial Clan. I've always believed that Xuan'er was only blinded! You... are not worthy, just as you were in the past, and will always be!"</p><p></p><p>Left Qishan's face turned pale, gritting his teeth.</p><p></p><p>As for Jiang Zhou, he was dumbfounded. He stared at Left Qishan, never expecting this man to be his father...</p><p></p><p>This was something he couldn't digest at the moment, and even if he could, what did it matter? They were all going to die anyway...</p><p></p><p>"Since the truth has been revealed... then you shall all die."</p><p></p><p>At this moment, Lu Changsheng let out a light laugh. His eyes flashed, and the azure sword qi suddenly surged in speed!</p><p></p><p>Jiang Wuji and all the scions of the Jiang Imperial Clan were immediately on high alert, their expressions tense, and a glimmer of uncontrollable despair appeared in their eyes.</p><p></p><p>Seeing this, Left Qishan's eyes filled with tears, and he kowtowed frantically, pleading, "Shopkeeper, Vengeance's son... can you..."</p><p></p><p>Lu Changsheng remained expressionless, as if he had not heard anything. The azure sword qi only grew more and more chilling.</p><p></p><p>Here is the full English translation of the excerpt from the Chinese novel:</p><p></p><p>"Scions of the Jiang Clan, block it!!!"</p><p></p><p>Jiang Wuji roared ferociously. His entire being had never been so disheveled, nor had he ever felt such despair.</p><p></p><p>"Clang—!"</p><p></p><p>The sword qi let out a startling cry.</p><p></p><p>This sword strike, no one could block!</p><p></p><p>.........</p><p></p><p>When the barrier of the Jiang Clan was easily shattered,</p><p></p><p>When the azure radiance illuminated every corner of the heavens and earth,</p><p></p><p>When the entire Jiang Clan and their domain were reduced to nothingness in the dazzling light...</p><p></p><p>People knew that the Scar of the Heavens had erased the Jiang Clan forever!</p><p></p><p>As the azure light that blanketed the sky dissipated, everyone remained dazed, their pupils dilating and contracting endlessly.</p><p></p><p>Left Chou Shan staggered, his eyes losing focus, as if he had lost his soul.</p><p></p><p>The Jiang Clan he had cherished was destroyed, he should have been delighted...</p><p></p><p>But his son had also vanished along with it, and he just couldn't bring himself to be happy...</p><p></p><p>"Father..." Left Qi Ran hurriedly supported him.</p><p></p><p>In the sky,</p><p></p><p>The ancient sword in Lu Changsheng's hand had been sheathed, and he stepped down from the high ground amidst the gaze of the multitude, walking step by step towards Left Chou Shan.</p><p></p><p>"Proprietor!"</p><p></p><p>Instantly, the people around here regained their senses, terrified, and knelt down in droves.</p><p></p><p>As far as the eye could see, both inside and outside the Blue Mysterious Town, the cultivator figures were as numerous as ants, numbering no less than hundreds of thousands.</p><p></p><p>Left Chou Shan knelt on the ground, his head buried in his chest.</p><p></p><p>Lu Changsheng looked down at him and smiled faintly, "Am I familiar with you?"</p><p></p><p>Left Chou Shan's body trembled, and his heart tightened. He stammered fearfully, "No... no..."</p><p></p><p>"Hehe." Lu Changsheng chuckled meaningfully and said, "You have the bloodline, but your heart is with the Jiang Clan. What's the point of keeping you around?"</p><p></p><p>Left Chou Shan's soul trembled, and he dared not speak.</p><p></p><p>"Just a son without bloodline, if you love him so much, you can just have another one. With your physique, you can have a hundred or eighty of them, can't you?" Lu Changsheng said.</p><p></p><p>"Pro... Proprietor is saying..." Left Chou Shan reacted, now terrified.</p><p></p><p>Lu Changsheng nodded and walked towards the inn. Suddenly, he stopped and turned his head to ask, "By the way, since I killed your son, you shouldn't hold a grudge against me, right? If you do, you and your Heavenly Snake Manor might not be able to stay..."</p><p></p><p>These words fell, and everyone's hearts turned cold. Although the Proprietor looked refined and elegant, he was truly ruthless... No wonder he was from the Black Calamity Domain.</p><p></p><p>Left Chou Shan's heart trembled, and before he could speak, the group of elders behind him were frightened pale. The Grand Elder hurriedly and fearfully answered, "Proprietor! Our Sect Master has no ill intentions at all! We can swear an oath! The Proprietor's ability to destroy the Jiang Clan is the greatest blessing to our Heavenly Snake Manor!!"</p><p></p><p>"Then that's good." </p><p></p><p>Lu Changsheng nodded lightly and stepped into the courtyard, disappearing from sight.</p><p></p><p>"Phew—"</p><p></p><p>The moment Lu Changsheng disappeared, the entire world suddenly let out a collective sigh of relief.</p><p></p><p>All the cultivators stood up trembling. They were terrified.</p><p></p><p>Even though the Proprietor of the inn didn't target them, he was truly terrifying.</p><p></p><p>They stood there, recalling the events of the day, still in a daze.</p><p></p><p>The once prosperous Jiang Clan had become history in such an absurd way...</p><p></p><p>Who could have imagined it?</p><p></p><p>Previously, in the Scar of the Heavens, the major clans were at their peak.</p><p></p><p>But from now on... everyone knew that the strongest in the Scar of the Heavens was the Proprietor of the Blue Mysterious Town's Black Calamity Domain, Lu Changsheng.</p><p></p><p>The true number one in the Scar of the Heavens.</p><p></p><p>.........</p><p></p><p>.........</p>

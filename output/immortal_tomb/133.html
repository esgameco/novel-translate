        <h1>Chapter 133</h1>
        <div class="content">
            <p>Here is the full English translation of the Chinese excerpt:</p><p></p><p>In the Immortal Realm of the Heavenly Emperor, at the Heavenly Mechanism Pavilion. üê§üçü‚ûÖ‚ûà‚ì¢–ΩœÖùìß.‚ÑÉ‚ìû‡πìüíòüíú</p><p></p><p>In the Taoist temple, the ancient Yin-Yang Immortal sat on the seat, eyes closed.</p><p></p><p>Shi Wushi paced back and forth anxiously.</p><p></p><p>Nangong Jing stood beside him, eyes tightly shut, as if calculating something with his fingertips.</p><p></p><p>"Ah, I wonder if the matter in the Eastern Immortal Realm has been resolved yet. The Immortal Emperor of Longevity is so powerful, it should be done quickly, right?" </p><p></p><p>Shi Wushi said hurriedly, scratching his head.</p><p></p><p>He would occasionally glance at the ancient Yin-Yang Immortal, his eyes filled with urgency, as his lifespan was only a few months, which was but a blink of an eye for them.</p><p></p><p>The ancient Yin-Yang Immortal opened his eyes and looked at Shi Wushi, saying, "You always say that I have a strange Yin-Yang aura, yet you seem quite concerned about me."</p><p></p><p>"Tch! Who's concerned about you?" Shi Wushi retorted with a shudder.</p><p></p><p>Just then, Lu Changsheng and the others appeared in the Taoist temple.</p><p></p><p>"Immortal Emperor of Longevity!" Shi Wushi exclaimed joyfully.</p><p></p><p>Chu Lingian and Feng Jiu immediately approached the ancient Yin-Yang Immortal, carefully examining him, and their pupils then constricted.</p><p></p><p>The ancient Yin-Yang Immortal's lifespan was indeed dwindling rapidly, terrifyingly so.</p><p></p><p>"Yin-Yang Immortal Emperor, you..." Chu Lingian's expression saddened, for they were old friends after all.</p><p></p><p>"Well, you youngsters are not doing so well," the old turtle said, teasing the ancient Yin-Yang Immortal. He had already understood Lu Changsheng's plan, so he was not worried at all.</p><p></p><p>Hearing this, the ancient Yin-Yang Immortal gave him a bitter smile.</p><p></p><p>"Immortal Emperor of Longevity, do you have a way to save the Yin-Yang Immortal?" Shi Wushi quickly looked at Lu Changsheng, his eyes filled with hope.</p><p></p><p>Lu Changsheng did not beat around the bush, nodding and saying directly, "Indeed, the solution is simple. All you need to do is have me take you to the Ancestral Heavenly Realm. Prepare yourselves in the next few days, and I will help you break through the Divine Path when the time comes."</p><p></p><p>Breaking through the Divine Path... The group heard this and were stunned. However, remembering Lu Changsheng's extraordinary abilities, they believed him.</p><p></p><p>If there was anyone in the Four Realms who could possess the power to break through the Divine Path, it would undoubtedly be the Immortal Emperor of Longevity standing before them.</p><p></p><p>But...</p><p></p><p>"However, Immortal Emperor of Longevity... The Divine Path is incredibly distant from the Five Great Immortal Realms. I heard that during the Immortal Calamity, it took us six hundred years to return from the Divine Path," Shi Wushi said with a troubled expression.</p><p></p><p>"The Yin-Yang Immortal only has a few months left. Won't we just end up with him dying on the way?"</p><p></p><p>Hearing this, the ancient Yin-Yang Immortal's brow furrowed slightly.</p><p></p><p>Lu Changsheng glanced at Shi Wushi and said indifferently, "You don't need to worry about that."</p><p></p><p>Shi Wushi immediately fell silent.</p><p></p><p>The ancient Yin-Yang Immortal shakily stood up and bowed gratefully, "Then I must rely on the Immortal Emperor of Longevity."</p><p></p><p>Lu Changsheng looked at him and said softly, "You secretly blocked the ascension channels at the Inspection Pavilion in the Soaring Yang Immortal Realm, violating the Immortal Statutes I personally formulated. What do you have to say for yourself?"</p><p></p><p>The group tensed up, all turning their gaze towards the ancient Yin-Yang Immortal.</p><p></p><p>The ancient Yin-Yang Immortal's scalp tingled. He wanted to say, "Since the Immortal Emperor of Longevity has already destroyed the Inspection Pavilion, can you just let this matter go?"</p><p></p><p>Seeing the ancient Yin-Yang Immortal's silence, Lu Changsheng continued, "The First Immortal Statute was also formulated by me. Are you saying the Immortal Emperor Palace should also be held accountable?"</p><p></p><p>The ancient Yin-Yang Immortal's expression changed, and he bowed awkwardly, "The Immortal Emperor of Longevity is correct..."</p><p></p><p>Shi Wushi and the others pursed their lips, the atmosphere becoming somewhat awkward. They wanted to plead for him, but after witnessing Lu Changsheng's might, they dared not.</p><p></p><p>Lu Changsheng nodded slightly, turning around and saying indifferently, "You know why I did this."</p><p></p><p>Here is the full English translation of the Chinese excerpt:</p><p></p><p>"So, do you all need a few more days to prepare before going to the Divine Path?"</p><p></p><p>The group shook their heads.</p><p></p><p>"I'm giving you a few days to properly organize your respective Immortal Emperor Palaces. I don't want you to go to the Ancestral Heavenly Realm and then have the Immortal Realm turn into a mess. If I have to intervene, your Immortal Emperor Palaces will be in big trouble."</p><p></p><p>Lu Changsheng said slowly.</p><p></p><p>The group looked at each other, hearing the seriousness in Lu Changsheng's tone.</p><p></p><p>"Immortal Emperor, please rest assured!" </p><p></p><p>The four Immortal Emperors quickly assured him.</p><p></p><p>Lu Changsheng waved his hand, "Go, and come find me at the Heavenly Mechanism Pavilion in five days. Old Turtle, you go help Ancient Yin-Yang organize his Immortal Emperor Palace."</p><p></p><p>"Okay, master, don't worry." </p><p></p><p>Old Turtle responded straightforwardly, then led the four Immortal Emperors away.</p><p></p><p>Only Lu Changsheng and the silent Nangong Jing remained in the Dao Courtyard.</p><p></p><p>"Immortal Emperor, Nangong will take his leave as well."</p><p></p><p>Nangong Jing bowed and was about to turn and leave, to let Lu Changsheng rest in peace.</p><p></p><p>"Nangong Jing, your lifespan is also nearing its end."</p><p></p><p>Lu Changsheng suddenly said, turning his head.</p><p></p><p>Nangong Jing paused, then turned around with a serene expression, respectfully smiling, "Since I am the current Heavenly Mechanism Pavilion Master, then that is my destiny."</p><p></p><p>Lu Changsheng instantly appeared in front of him, calmly saying, "Once Ancient Yin-Yang goes to the Ancestral Heavenly Realm, there won't be a suitable Immortal Emperor candidate for the Southern Immortal Realm."</p><p></p><p>Nangong Jing's body trembled, looking up at Lu Changsheng with surprise. As a Heavenly Mechanism Master, he immediately understood the implication.</p><p></p><p>He clasped his hands gratefully, "Thank you, Immortal Emperor, for your kindness. But my lifespan is not much longer than Yin-Yang's Immortal Emperor..."</p><p></p><p>"So the next Southern Immortal Realm Immortal Emperor position will be yours to take." </p><p></p><p>Lu Changsheng interrupted, stating it firmly.</p><p></p><p>Nangong Jing's eyes widened, but he eventually resigned himself to it.</p><p></p><p>"You don't need to worry about your lifespan. You're different from Ancient Yin-Yang, whose lifespan was consumed. Yours was taken by the Heavenly Dao. Since that's the case, can't you just take it back?"</p><p></p><p>Lu Changsheng said lightly.</p><p></p><p>Nangong Jing was dumbfounded! Take it back...?</p><p></p><p>As a Heavenly Mechanism Master, he naturally knew about the Heavenly Dao of the Four Immortal Realms, sensing its presence, but he had never seen it with his own eyes!</p><p></p><p>He knew the Heavenly Dao of the Four Immortal Realms was an incomparable existence, far exceeding the status of the Five Great Immortal Emperors.</p><p></p><p>So for Lu Changsheng to say this, it was truly shocking to Nangong Jing. He even began to doubt Lu Changsheng's identity, though he instinctively did not doubt the truthfulness of his words.</p><p></p><p>"You seem a bit unbelieving?" </p><p></p><p>Lu Changsheng smiled.</p><p></p><p>"Ah, not at all! Whatever the Immortal Emperor says, Nangong naturally believes a hundred times over. It's just that..." Nangong Jing hurriedly explained.</p><p></p><p>"No need for more words. Follow me to the Ninth Heaven. Today, I'll let you meet the Heavenly Dao of the Four Immortal Realms and have it return the lifespan it took from you. If it refuses, then we'll fight."</p><p></p><p>Lu Changsheng said, waving his sleeve and instantly teleporting the bewildered Nangong Jing up into the sky.</p>

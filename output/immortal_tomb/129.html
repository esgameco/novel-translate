        <h1>Chapter 129</h1>
        <div class="content">
            <p>Here is the full English translation of the Chinese excerpt:</p><p></p><p>The howling wind carried sand and gravel, the air was filled with the aura of blood!</p><p></p><p>The Immortal Emperor of Longevity!</p><p></p><p>That imperial title from memory suddenly surfaced in everyone's minds!</p><p></p><p>The Three Great Immortal Sages of the Central Immortal Realm, the various Immortal Kings were stunned on the spot. That was their elusive master, but...</p><p></p><p>On the Sand City, Chu Xie and Zhang Youdao exchanged a glance, both speechless. They had met the Immortal Emperor of Longevity before, but in this dire situation, would the Immortal Emperor's appearance really be of any use? It would only be a waste of another Immortal Emperor...</p><p></p><p>This imperial title also awakened the memories of countless mortals in the Sand City, they revealed sorrowful expressions and knelt down involuntarily. </p><p></p><p>"Oh, our most revered Immortal Emperor of Longevity, where are you now? Can you once again save us as you did when you established the Immortal Statutes to protect the mortals all those years ago!"</p><p></p><p>"Haha, the Immortal Emperor of Longevity from the Central Immortal Realm? Even if he's here, what can he do? Does he have the power to save you all? Before the might of my Yuhun Demon Clan, any Immortal Emperor is just a dog!"</p><p></p><p>Youshi sneered and waved his hand, ordering, "Continue the slaughter!"</p><p></p><p>"Just dogs?"</p><p></p><p>Just as the Yuhun Demon Clan was about to make their move, a cold voice resounded through the heavens and earth, echoing in everyone's ears!</p><p></p><p>Everyone was stunned, looking around in bewilderment.</p><p></p><p>Only Shi Wushi, Gu Yinyang, Hunqiu, Nangong Jing, the powerhouses of the Central Immortal Realm, as well as Leigu, Chu Xie, and Zhang Youdao were suddenly shaken to the core!</p><p></p><p>This voice was so familiar to them...</p><p></p><p>They hurriedly looked around, their heartbeats quickening.</p><p></p><p>In the next moment, a young man in blue robes gradually materialized, standing with his hands behind his back, his expression indifferent.</p><p></p><p>Seeing this figure that had not been seen for hundreds of millions of years, Shi Wushi was stunned, his eyes instantly brimming with tears. For some reason, the pent-up frustration in his heart dissipated greatly, and he trembled...</p><p></p><p>Here is my translation of the Chinese excerpt you provided:</p><p></p><p>The voice said, </p><p></p><p>"Long...Longshen Immortal Emperor, you've finally come...I, we, Yinyang he..."</p><p></p><p>The fragmented words scattered with the wind.</p><p></p><p>But whether they had seen Luchang Sheng before or not, at this moment everyone could hear clearly - the plain-dressed young man before them was truly that Longshen Immortal Emperor!! He had really appeared!</p><p></p><p>On the Sands City, Chu Lang, Huang Zhong, and Chen He stood dumbfounded, their pupils shrinking as they stared at this unassuming young man, their minds reeling in shock.</p><p></p><p>The senior in the blue robe was actually...</p><p></p><p>Qin Miaomiao and Liu Wusu were even more bewildered, their bodies swaying as if about to collapse. This blue-robed man who had appeared at the Spiritual Dust Realm's Ascension Grand Ceremony was actually...</p><p></p><p>At some point, a deathly silence had fallen.</p><p></p><p>Somehow, everyone felt a sense of reassurance in their hearts, as if they had grasped a lifeline while drowning, as if the oppression in their hearts was about to burst forth.</p><p></p><p>They felt that the Longshen Immortal Emperor could truly subdue the Youming Demon Tribe!</p><p></p><p>The next moment, the sound of knees hitting the ground was incessant.</p><p></p><p>The Nine Great Immortal Sages, the Immortal Kings, and all the cultivators and mortals still alive here all knelt down in the sea of blood, grief-stricken.</p><p></p><p>"Please, Immortal Emperor, bless our Immortal Realm!"</p><p></p><p>The resounding voices rose and fell, echoing endlessly, shaking the heavens in this desolate desert.</p><p></p><p>Luchang Sheng's expression remained calm. His gaze swept over the reverent crowd, the scorching piles of corpses and severed limbs, and finally rested quietly on the ancient Yin and Yang.</p><p></p><p>The ancient Yin and Yang was also watching him, but his eyeballs were violently trembling, in great disarray!</p><p></p><p>Luchang Sheng withdrew his gaze and abruptly turned to face the Youming Demon Tribe's main force, a rare fierce light appearing in his eyes.</p><p></p><p>He spoke lightly, his domineering voice resounding through the heavens and earth:</p><p></p><p>"I, the Emperor, have agreed."</p><p></p><p>"Not a single one of the foreign tribe here will be left alive."</p>

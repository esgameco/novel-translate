        <h1>Chapter 483</h1>
        <div class="content">
            <p>Here is the full English translation of the Chinese excerpt:</p><p></p><p>After a moment.</p><p></p><p>Luchang Sheng flipped his hand, and a transparent stone appeared in his palm. He then threw it to the captain in front of the puzzled onlookers.</p><p></p><p>"Try inputting some spiritual energy into it."</p><p></p><p>The captain hurriedly took the transparent stone with both hands, and then looked at it, puzzled, as he infused it with a thread of spiritual energy.</p><p></p><p>The transparent stone immediately began to flash with light, and then a faint glow shot out from the stone, projecting an image into the night sky.</p><p></p><p>Sss!</p><p></p><p>The onlookers looked at the projected image, and the expressions of puzzlement on their faces instantly turned to shock!</p><p></p><p>They saw the strange scene depicted in the image, and for a moment they even forgot that these people had come back to kill them. </p><p></p><p>They only knew that the scene shown in the image was very bizarre - aside from the two sailors who were looking around with expressions of great terror, all the other people seemed to have been frozen in place by some mysterious force, and they could vaguely see the fear and bewilderment in the eyes of those people.</p><p></p><p>"This, this..." The captain's face turned somewhat pale as he pointed at the image, at a loss for words.</p><p></p><p>It was Chen Pang, Xiao Chai, and the two elves who furtively glanced at Luchang Sheng, their eyes full of trepidation.</p><p></p><p>"These images have already been imprinted in the stone. You can keep the stone. As for how your Shipping Guild will deal with the forces these people belong to, that is no longer my concern," Luchang Sheng said indifferently, hands behind his back as he looked at the image.</p><p></p><p>Clearly, these words were directed at the captain.</p><p></p><p>The captain was stunned for a moment, then he understood. He cupped his hands and said gratefully, "Thank you, great sir."</p><p></p><p>The cultivators were all shaken, and they finally fully understood, looking at Luchang Sheng with awe-filled eyes.</p><p></p><p>So, this was another method of the Azure Robe Lord...</p><p></p><p>It was just that they were so far away, they hadn't noticed at all how the Azure Robe Lord had detected it, and how he had restrained those people from such a distance.</p><p></p><p>What kind of technique was this?</p><p></p><p>Luchang Sheng nodded slightly, then lightly waved his sleeve.</p><p></p><p>Then the cultivators witnessed a sight they would never forget!</p><p></p><p>After Luchang Sheng waved his sleeve, the group of the Three Tigers Gang in the image was simply erased, as if they had never been there.</p><p></p><p>The onlookers were dumbfounded, and their bodies soon began to tremble uncontrollably, some even going limp and almost falling from the high altitude.</p><p></p><p>They watched, wide-eyed, as a group of living people were wiped out completely, and during the process, there was no surge of laws, no ripples of spiritual energy...</p><p></p><p>Could this be the legendary Profound Technique?</p><p></p><p>It was rumored that among the three thousand Dharma Realms, there were only a few who had mastered the Profound Technique. Many of them had never even seen a Profound Technique expert in action.</p><p></p><p>But they vaguely believed that this mysterious Azure Robe Lord was most likely one of the legendary Profound Technique experts!</p><p></p><p>Chen Pang and Xiao Chai were bowing their heads, terrified beyond measure at this moment.</p><p></p><p>And not only them, even Qing and Lin, the two elves, had faces as white as sheets!</p><p></p><p>Lin glanced at Qing with difficulty, bitterly thinking to herself, could Qing's guess really be right...</p><p></p><p>That this Azure Robed man was a Profound Technique expert from beyond the Three Thousand Dharma Realms.</p><p></p><p>"Great, great, great sir, thank you for your help. I will report this matter to my superiors, and it will surely reach the ears of the Guild Master..." </p><p></p><p>The captain said, drenched in cold sweat. The pressure on him had suddenly skyrocketed - he had never felt such pressure in his life!</p><p></p><p>Before, everything was fine, but now that Luchang Sheng seemed to have mastered the Profound Technique, the captain could no longer remain calm.</p><p></p><p>Facing a Profound Technique expert, who knows how much pressure there could be!</p><p></p><p>This was the first time he had encountered a Profound Technique expert.</p><p></p><p>Although the Guild Master of the Shipping Guild was a Profound Technique expert, the captain had never seen him.</p><p></p><p>The captain knew that once this matter reached the Guild Master's ears, the Guild Master would surely be unsettled as well!</p><p></p><p>After all, the Profound Technique represented...</p><p></p><p>Here is the full English translation of the Chinese excerpt:</p><p></p><p>The Pinnacle of the Three Thousand Dharma Realms!</p><p></p><p>The surrounding cultivators were bowing and crouching, having become extremely cautious and anxious, no longer daring to say another word, their breathing even a bit labored.</p><p></p><p>There's no helping it, anyone would be afraid in this situation.</p><p></p><p>At this time, Lu Changsheng merely smiled faintly:</p><p></p><p>"No need to thank me, a gentleman does not eat food that comes unsolicited, so consider it as room rent."</p><p></p><p>The captain was taken aback for a moment, then hurriedly said with some anxiety, "Sir, for a person of your exalted status to stay in the top-tier suite is only fitting, how could we speak of room rent..."</p><p></p><p>"Leave it be." Lu Changsheng waved his hand impatiently, interrupting, then took the lead and flew forward unhurriedly.</p><p></p><p>Seeing this, the captain could only sigh inwardly, and at the same time was relieved that he had attended to this person well earlier, otherwise he would have lost two subordinate crew members this time.</p><p></p><p>"Everyone, quickly follow the sir."</p><p></p><p>The captain waved his hand, and the group silently followed after.</p><p></p><p>.........</p><p></p><p>"What?! Big Bear's soul plate is shattered?!"</p><p></p><p>On Eternal Night Island, within the Three Tigers Gang, a man with a full beard frowned and shouted.</p><p></p><p>"Th-Third Boss, not only has the Hall Master Big Bear died, but also hundreds of our brothers." The subordinate swallowed hard, his tone extremely difficult.</p><p></p><p>Boom!</p><p></p><p>The bearded man, known as the Third Boss, abruptly stood up, his gaze fierce. "Our Three Tigers Gang has dominated Eternal Night Island for so many years, apart from when we first arrived, when have we ever lost a Hall Master, let alone so many of our gang members?!"</p><p></p><p>"Tell me, how did Big Bear and the others die?!"</p><p></p><p>The Third Boss stared at the subordinate, and due to speaking so loudly, sprayed him with spittle.</p><p></p><p>The subordinate didn't dare wipe it off, and spoke in a low voice, "Third Boss, as soon as I learned of Big Bear Hall Master's incident, I came to report to you. We currently have no leads, but I have already arranged for people to investigate..."</p><p></p><p>"Big Bear Hall Master and the others were on patrol at the various ports tonight, collecting..." The subordinate saw the Third Boss glare at him and quickly corrected, "protection fees from passing ships. Big Bear's incident is likely related to this, and we should have a clue soon!"</p><p></p><p>The Third Boss took a deep breath and heavily sat back down, coldly saying, "It's also very possible that the other two factions are behind this. We've never seen eye to eye, and Big Bear's death may well be their doing. In any case, have my men investigate! The Hall Masters and brothers of my Three Tigers Gang cannot have died in vain!"</p><p></p><p>"I will make them pay in blood!"</p><p></p><p>"Yes, Third Boss, rest assured!" The subordinate said, then turned to leave.</p><p></p><p>The Third Boss looked at the retreating back of the subordinate and indifferently said, "Wait."</p><p></p><p>The subordinate immediately turned back and bowed.</p><p></p><p>"Big Bear has been devoted to the gang all this time, so retrieve his body and give him a proper burial."</p><p></p><p>"Yes!"</p><p></p><p>.........</p><p></p><p>And so, the previously quiet Eternal Night Island became different from before.</p><p></p><p>Many perceptive cultivators noticed that the members of the Three Tigers Gang today had an unusually solemn air, and there were Three Tigers Gang members roaming the streets and alleys, as if searching for something.</p><p></p><p>What had happened?</p><p></p><p>The cultivators did not know that not only here, but at all the ports of Eternal Night Island, the Three Tigers Gang also had many members rushing over.</p><p></p><p>The movements of the Three Tigers Gang naturally could not be hidden from the other two factions on the island. Out of curiosity, the two factions promptly sent subordinates to investigate.</p><p></p><p>With the arrival of Lu Changsheng and the others, the originally calm Eternal Night Island was gradually taking on an ominous atmosphere.</p>

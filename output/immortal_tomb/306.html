        <h1>Chapter 306</h1>
        <div class="content">
            <p>Here is the full English translation of the excerpt from the Chinese novel:</p><p></p><p>Lu Changsheng nodded and, in the eyes of the crowd, he and Miao Hantian went to sit down at the core viewing area.</p><p></p><p>The South Palace Clan Leader and the others suddenly became reserved, and they greeted Lu Changsheng one after another.</p><p></p><p>Lu Changsheng ignored them, slightly tilting his head and seeing the bewildered Liu Tu, Fu Liangcai, and Liu Qing behind him.</p><p></p><p>He then smiled and said, "Where have you all been these past few days?"</p><p></p><p>Liu Tu and the others were slightly dazed. Before they could respond, Miao Hantian was delighted and quickly said, "Master, Liu and the others have recently been invited by the young Miao to visit the clan."</p><p></p><p>Liu Tu and the others smiled awkwardly and nodded.</p><p></p><p>The South Palace Clan Leader and the others were suddenly shocked, not expecting the old fox Miao Hantian to have already known that the young man in green robes was a powerful figure.</p><p></p><p>They then hurriedly cupped their hands and greeted Liu Tu and the other two:</p><p></p><p>"Brother Liu, and... well, the two of you, I've long heard of your renowned names. After the tea conference, you must grace us with a visit to the South Palace Clan."</p><p></p><p>"Brother Liu, the two of you, although the South Palace Clan is good, our Li Clan is not inferior either, right here in the Royal City, so please do grace us with a visit as well!"</p><p></p><p>"........"</p><p></p><p>Listening to the compliments from the crowd, the faces of Liu Tu and the others flushed red, with a mix of emotions surging in their hearts.</p><p></p><p>The people in front of them were no ordinary people, but the top figures of the Ancient Wasteland.</p><p></p><p>They even politely addressed a Spiritual Yang Realm cultivator and two Spiritual Origin Realm cultivators as "brother"... all because of the senior in green robes.</p><p></p><p>They couldn't help but nervously respond while glancing at the young man in green robes.</p><p></p><p>They felt both awe and a sense of dreamlike wonder. Who would have thought that such peerless experts would descend upon the Shocked Cloud City.</p><p></p><p>........</p><p></p><p>After the awkward greetings, the viewing area quickly fell silent.</p><p></p><p>The corner of everyone's eyes would occasionally, intentionally or unintentionally, glance towards the quietly seated young man in green robes.</p><p></p><p>It seemed that they all wanted to see through the bronze mask and glimpse the face beneath.</p><p></p><p>In the arena, Duan Jiu Xiong saw that everything seemed to have returned to normal, and he cleared his throat and called out:</p><p></p><p>"Ahem, the tea conference continues!"</p><p></p><p>The gathered prodigies trembled slightly upon hearing this.</p><p></p><p>After the previous events, they no longer had the initial vigor and enthusiasm.</p><p></p><p>Especially the pool of blood where the Invisible had stood, deeply shocking them.</p><p></p><p>Afterwards, the tea conference proceeded without much interest.</p><p></p><p>After all, everyone's focus was on the mysterious young man in the viewing area.</p><p></p><p>Even without any battles, the top nine rankings were decided.</p><p></p><p>Li Shuoyan's first place was not disputed by anyone, and not just because of the person backing him up, but also his own strength, which was evident in his defeat of the Evil Abyss.</p><p></p><p>The Blood Demon Moon ranked second, and she certainly had the strength to defeat Li Shuoyan, but she knew Li Shuoyan was Lu Changsheng's follower, so she did not challenge him, as it would be meaningless.</p><p></p><p>Following that were South Palace Wenheart, Li Qing, and other Spiritual Yang Realm prodigies.</p><p></p><p>As for the tenth place... it was the mysterious young man in green robes in the viewing area.</p><p></p><p>"The... the tea conference ends here..." Duan Jiu Xiong said, looking towards Lu Changsheng in the viewing area and bowing.</p><p></p><p>Lu Changsheng nodded slightly and slowly stood up.</p><p></p><p>The South Palace Clan Leader and the others hurriedly stood up as well, not daring to remain seated.</p><p></p><p>Lu Changsheng glanced towards the distant horizon and said, "Mind your own business."</p><p></p><p>With that, he flashed into the arena, standing alongside the other ten prodigies!</p><p></p><p>South Palace Wenheart, Li Qing, and the others immediately grew tense!</p><p></p><p>"Clang!"</p><p></p><p>At that moment, a clear and resounding sword song echoed through the heavens!</p><p></p><p>Violent sword qi waves swept across the Ancient Wasteland Royal City, causing the city to become restless.</p><p></p><p>Everyone on the plaza in front of the Overlord's Mansion looked up in shock!</p><p></p><p>The Ancient Wasteland Sword Clan had arrived!</p><p></p><p>Here is the full English translation of the Chinese excerpt:</p><p></p><p>He arrived just in time, right after the Heavenly Monarch Assembly had just ended!</p><p></p><p>The next moment!</p><p></p><p>Three figures swooped down from the sky like sharp swords, suddenly appearing in the square!!</p><p></p><p>It was an old man in a purple robe and two young men.</p><p></p><p>The old man in the purple robe swept a glance at the ten people led by Lu Changsheng, and smiled at Duan Jiuniong:</p><p></p><p>"Hehe, as expected, I knew the Heavenly Monarch Assembly was about to end. Duan Jiuniong, you've done well."</p><p></p><p>"Greetings, Sword Steward!" </p><p></p><p>Duan Jiuniong hurriedly went up to meet him.</p><p></p><p>The Elders of the Nangong Clan and the others also quickly came down from the spectator seats, appearing in the square, greeting and saluting the old man in the purple robe.</p><p></p><p>The mysterious Ancient Desolate Sword Clan, apart from the once-in-twenty-thousand-year Heavenly Monarch Assembly, there was practically no opportunity to see them ordinarily.</p><p></p><p>Lu Changsheng looked at the old man in the purple robe with a faint expression, the corners of his mouth under the mask curving slightly upwards.</p><p></p><p>So he has finally seen the Ancient Desolate Sword Clan...</p><p></p><p>However, he did not hurry to make a move. Through the Blood Demon Moon, he knew that the people of the Eight Ancient Clans should have mental prohibitions in their minds. If their souls were searched, the memories of their clan locations would be instantly erased.</p><p></p><p>At the same time,</p><p></p><p>The Elders of the Nangong Clan, the Lai Clan, and Zhou Zhenjiang cast sidelong glances at Lu Changsheng in the Heavenly Monarch team, their eyes flickering with light and hesitation...</p><p></p><p>The atmosphere here suddenly began to become eerie.</p><p></p><p>The old man in the purple robe immediately sensed this atmosphere and couldn't help but furrow his brows: "Jiuniong, what's going on?"</p><p></p><p>Duan Jiuniong's gaze slightly changed, and he couldn't help but turn his head to look at the Elders of the Nangong Clan and the others, then quickly composed himself and smiled: </p><p></p><p>"Hehe, Sword Steward, since we rarely see the Ancient Desolate Sword Clan, it's only natural that everyone feels awe and trepidation when they suddenly see you."</p><p></p><p>The old man in the purple robe nodded upon hearing this, which did make sense. The Ancient Desolate Sword Clan was of such a supreme status, so this was not surprising.</p><p></p><p>He then had no further doubts, and said indifferently: "Hmm, then let it be. Are the top ten of this Heavenly Monarch Assembly them?"</p><p></p><p>As he spoke, he looked towards Lu Changsheng and the others, and after a sweep of his gaze, he was secretly satisfied, not bad.</p><p></p><p>"Yes, Sword Steward, they are the top ten of this Heavenly Monarch Assembly!" Duan Jiuniong replied with a bow.</p><p></p><p>At the same time, the two young men behind the old man in the purple robe were also sweeping their gazes over Lu Changsheng and the others, but their eyes were full of disdain and superiority.</p><p></p><p>What trash Heavenly Monarchs, when they come to the Ancient Desolate Sword Clan, they'll just be sword servants to the disciples of the Ancient Desolate Sword Clan, hehe.</p><p></p><p>As for this kind of superior gaze, Nangong Wenxin and the others didn't feel much about it. The disciples of the Ancient Desolate Sword Clan were naturally of lofty status, not something they could compare to.</p><p></p><p>"Alright, I won't stay long. I'll just take them back to the clan now. You all come to my side and go back to the clan with me."</p><p></p><p>The old man in the purple robe said indifferently, apparently not wanting to linger too long in the Ancient Desolate Capital.</p><p></p><p>Lu Changsheng, Li Shuo-yan, and the others slowly walked over and stood behind the old man in the purple robe.</p><p></p><p>At this time, Duan Jiuniong said awkwardly, "Sword Steward, what about the rewards for the top 1,500 Heavenly Monarchs? You haven't given them to me yet..."</p><p></p><p>As for that huge amount of rewards, the city lord of this Ancient Desolate Capital couldn't afford to pay it out.</p><p></p><p>The old man in the purple robe paused, almost forgetting about it, then waved his hand and tossed a ring to Duan Jiuniong, "This is the reward for the top 1,500. As for these ten, there's no need to award them. I'll personally give it to them after we return to the clan."</p><p></p><p>"Understood..." Duan Jiuniong quickly put away the "heavy" ring.</p><p></p><p>At this moment, the old man in the purple robe suddenly swept his gaze over the Elders of the Nangong Clan and the others, then his gaze suddenly narrowed, and he asked puzzledly, "Hmm? Didn't the Blood Demon Pavilion and the Shadow Killing Tower participate in this Heavenly Monarch Assembly?"</p><p></p><p>These two factions were also among the top powers in the Ancient Desolate Ruins, aside from the Ancient Desolate Sword Clan.</p><p></p><p>Not participating, how could that be?</p><p></p><p>Everyone's hearts suddenly trembled!</p>

        <h1>Chapter 275</h1>
        <div class="content">
            <p>Here is the full English translation of the Chinese excerpt:</p><p></p><p>Seeing the expressions of the crowd, üò≥üê∫69·πßƒß·µò‚ìç.ƒÜùìû–ºüí•üíÄ</p><p></p><p>Lu Changsheng smiled and said, "Then you all can discuss family matters first, I'm not in a hurry."</p><p></p><p>After saying that, he and Li Shuyan walked out.</p><p></p><p>Fu Liangcai snapped out of it and hurriedly instructed, "Elder, please take the two esteemed guests to rest!"</p><p></p><p>"Uh, yes!" The Elder quickly walked out.</p><p></p><p>"Phew~"</p><p></p><p>The crowd let out a slight sigh of relief. They were truly startled when they suddenly heard about the Ancient Desolate Sword Clan without any prior warning.</p><p></p><p>Especially that mysterious man in blue robes wearing a bronze mask, he even wanted to find the Ancient Desolate Sword Clan... They didn't know what he was thinking.</p><p></p><p>"Have a seat." </p><p></p><p>Fu Liangcai's eyes flickered as he turned and sat at the high position. </p><p></p><p>Sitting on the sides were Fu Shiyu and Fu Tao, as well as a group of elders.</p><p></p><p>Before Fu Liangcai could ask, Fu Shiyu suddenly stood up and bowed, blaming herself, "Father, this time when we went to the Void, we did not manage to harvest any Void Mushrooms. Please punish us."</p><p></p><p>Fu Tao also hurriedly stood up and bent over.</p><p></p><p>What?! They didn't get any Void Mushrooms?</p><p></p><p>The elders looked at each other in dismay! </p><p></p><p>They couldn't help but feel a bit uncomfortable in their hearts. Going to the Void and not getting any Void Mushrooms, then what was the point of going there, just for fun?</p><p></p><p>This opportunity was hard-won, but it was wasted like this.</p><p></p><p>After all, the Fu Clan is no longer at its peak. If they had the Void Mushrooms, perhaps they could have staved off their decline for a while longer.</p><p></p><p>However, Fu Liangcai asked in a deep voice, "Shiyu, Tao'er, tell me what happened?"</p><p></p><p>As their father, he knew Shiyu the best. If there were no accidents, she would not have returned empty-handed.</p><p></p><p>Hearing this, Shiyu's eyes were filled with lingering fear as she said with difficulty, "Father, Elders, you don't know, when we were in the Void, we encountered what seemed to be a powerful expert from the Ancient Desolate Sword Clan..."</p><p></p><p>Fu Liangcai and the elders abruptly stood up, their eyes filled with disbelief and trembling.</p><p></p><p>Before they could recover, Shiyu's next sentence shocked them even more.</p><p></p><p>"And five World-level Unbound Celestial Dao."</p><p></p><p>Fu Tao also bitterly smiled and said, "Yes, Father, my sister and I truly walked on the edge of death. How could we still dare to go and collect Void Mushrooms."</p><p></p><p>In the hall, everyone fell silent, the atmosphere freezing.</p><p></p><p>After a moment, Fu Liangcai sat back down and asked solemnly, "Shiyu, tell us the details, what happened afterwards?"</p><p></p><p>The elders even suspected that Shiyu and Fu Tao were lying.</p><p></p><p>After all, the Ancient Desolate Sword Clan and the Unbound Celestial Dao, even five World-level ones... All of this was too ethereal and absurd for them.</p><p></p><p>"Father, the situation at the time was like this..." Shiyu quickly recounted the details of what had happened.</p><p></p><p>Afterwards, the crowd was deeply shaken and fell even more silent.</p><p></p><p>Fu Liangcai frowned and asked, "After a sword chant, that suspected expert from the Ancient Desolate Sword Clan and the five Unbound Celestial Dao just disappeared??"</p><p></p><p>Fu Tao patted his chest nervously and said, "Yes, Father, they probably went to fight in another void space. Fortunately, the void is vast, and we are like specks of dust, unlikely to attract their attention... But the expert from the Ancient Desolate Sword Clan is too powerful, to be able to fight against five Celestial Dao!"</p><p></p><p>At the end, he had an admiring look on his face.</p><p></p><p>"As for the Void Mushrooms, never mind. With such an incident happening, not only you two, even I and the Elders probably wouldn't dare to linger in the Void anymore."</p><p></p><p>Fu Liangcai sighed regretfully, then asked, "Oh yes, Shiyu, how did you two encounter those two people?"</p><p></p><p>Shiyu's gaze shifted.</p><p></p><p>The crowd also knew that Fu Liangcai was asking about that mysterious man in blue robes.</p><p></p><p>Here is the full English translation of the Chinese excerpt:</p><p></p><p>Accompanied by his followers.</p><p></p><p>New 69 Book Bar 99üÖ¢üÖóüÖ§üÖß.üÖíüÖûüÖú</p><p></p><p>"Father, those two seniors were also encountered at that time. After the sound of the sword had just disappeared, we were about to leave when we met those two seniors," Fu Shiyu smiled.</p><p></p><p>Also encountered at that time? How coincidental?</p><p></p><p>Fu Liancai was slightly taken aback, and he blurted out, "Isn't this a bit too coincidental?"</p><p></p><p>But as soon as he finished speaking, he regretted it.</p><p></p><p>Such a brainless remark actually came from the mouth of the clan leader. Those two were obviously not the powerful figures of the Ancient Wasteland Sword Clan, otherwise how could he have asked them such a question? Moreover, their aura was not that terrifying.</p><p></p><p>But the speaker was careless, while the listener was thoughtful. Fu Shiyu was, however, startled.</p><p></p><p>Quickly, she also shook her head, impossible, but at this moment, a shocking guess was taking root in her heart...</p><p></p><p>The others also shook their heads to deny the thoughts in their hearts.</p><p></p><p>In their perception, the only ones who could defy the Heavenly Dao were the mysterious Eight Ancient Clans!</p><p></p><p>And those two were outsiders.</p><p></p><p>At this time, Fu Tao hesitated and said, "Father, why do you think that senior wanted to find the Ancient Wasteland Sword Clan?"</p><p></p><p>Fu Liancai frowned and shook his head, then slowly stood up: "You all go and rest."</p><p></p><p>After saying that, he disappeared from the hall.</p><p></p><p>Seeing this, Fu Shiyu and Fu Tao bowed to the elders and also withdrew.</p><p></p><p>The elders, however, were in an uproar.</p><p></p><p>"Ah, these two people are quite mysterious. Coming to visit our Fu Clan, we don't know if it's a blessing or a curse for our Fu Clan."</p><p></p><p>"Yes, as soon as they opened their mouths, they asked about the Ancient Wasteland Sword Clan... It feels as if they have a grudge against the Ancient Wasteland Sword Clan, which is truly terrifying!"</p><p></p><p>"So what? Our Fu Clan is currently in a difficult situation. To put it bluntly, the danger of our clan's destruction is right in front of us. We don't care about the Ancient Wasteland Sword Clan anymore!"</p><p></p><p>"That's right, those two people don't seem to be ordinary people. If we can get their help in the future, it would be great!"</p><p></p><p>"As for the Ancient Wasteland Sword Clan... Our Fu Clan may be on the verge of destruction, so we don't care about them anymore!"</p><p></p><p>"........"</p><p></p><p>.........</p><p></p><p>Outside a luxurious guest room of the Fu Clan.</p><p></p><p>Li Shuyan, holding Zhan Xu, stood with his eyes closed at the door.</p><p></p><p>Suddenly, he opened his eyes and saw Fu Liancai and the Grand Elder approaching this way.</p><p></p><p>"Hehe, fellow Daoist."</p><p></p><p>Fu Liancai immediately cupped his hands in greeting.</p><p></p><p>Li Shuyan nodded slightly and said, "I don't know what business the Fu Clan Leader has come for?"</p><p></p><p>After examining Li Shuyan, Fu Liancai's gaze in his eyes deepened for a moment, then he smiled and said, "Uh, that blue-robed fellow Daoist just asked about the Ancient Wasteland Sword Clan, so I came for this."</p><p></p><p>"Come in." At this moment, Lu Changsheng's voice came from the room.</p><p></p><p>Li Shuyan stepped aside and gestured for him to enter.</p><p></p><p>Fu Liancai smiled slightly, leaving the Grand Elder outside, and then entered alone.</p><p></p><p>Soon, he entered the room and saw the figure in blue sitting by the tea table.</p><p></p><p>The eyes under Lu Changsheng's bronze mask flashed, and he poured a cup of tea for him, smiling, "Fu Clan Leader, please sit."</p><p></p><p>Fu Liancai felt embarrassed, as the other party's demeanor was more like the host, and he was the guest.</p><p></p><p>He then walked to the other side of the tea table, sat down calmly, smiled at Lu Changsheng, and then picked up a cup of tea, sinking into silence.</p><p></p><p>Lu Changsheng was also in no hurry, sipping tea intermittently, waiting for him.</p><p></p><p>Later, Fu Liancai put down the teacup, straightened his expression, and cupped his hands to ask, "May I ask what is the fellow Daoist's surname?"</p><p></p><p>Lu Changsheng modestly cupped his hands in return, lightly chuckling, "No need for courtesy, just call me Lu."</p>

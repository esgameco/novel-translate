        <h1>Chapter 398</h1>
        <div class="content">
            <p>Here is the full English translation of the Chinese excerpt:</p><p></p><p>Uproar!!</p><p></p><p>All the tribes were shocked and looked at Shen Ting unbelievably, as if they thought they had heard wrong!</p><p></p><p>What did they hear?</p><p></p><p>Hand over all the divine bodies??? </p><p></p><p>The divine son of the Heavenly God Tribe had already possessed the number one divine body on the divine body ranking list...</p><p></p><p>Yet the Heavenly God Tribe still coveted the other ninety-nine divine bodies... What a huge ambition!</p><p></p><p>Bi Qiong, Ao Xing and other divine body owners' expressions suddenly changed, lowering their heads, their eyes filled with endless anger and resentment.</p><p></p><p>No one could have expected this sudden situation. Indeed, with strength, one can do whatever they want...</p><p></p><p>On the stone pillar, Bi You, Ao Zhen Tian and others glared angrily.</p><p></p><p>"Shen Ting!! You are delusional! The divine bodies are bestowed by heaven, your cruel method is against the Heavenly Harmony!!"</p><p></p><p>The Heavenly Crow Tribe Chief could no longer hold back his furious roar!</p><p></p><p>For the divine body owners, if their divine bodies were taken away, the loss of the divine bodies would be the least of their worries. The most important thing is that if their divine bodies were taken, they would be completely ruined, and the serious ones would directly lose their lives!</p><p></p><p>What's the difference between this and directly killing them?</p><p></p><p>Moreover, the divine body owners are either the holy sons of their tribes or the current tribal chiefs. Shen Ting's actions are practically pushing the top hundred tribes to their deaths!</p><p></p><p>Many cultivators from the top hundred tribes, seeing the Heavenly Crow Tribe Chief speak up first, finally gathered the courage to speak up one after another:</p><p></p><p>"Great Heavenly God Master, this move is not appropriate..."</p><p>"Great Heavenly God Master, we hope you can be magnanimous. If the divine bodies are taken away, it would be ruinous at best, and annihilating at worst!"</p><p>"Yes, none of our tribes can bear such a huge loss!"</p><p>"..."</p><p></p><p>Shen Ting listened to these opposing voices, sneering slightly, and suddenly turned his head to look at the leading Heavenly Crow Tribe Chief on the stone pillar, and then the mysterious spiritual vortex in his palm slowly surged...</p><p></p><p>The next moment, it suddenly rushed towards the Heavenly Crow Tribe Chief!</p><p></p><p>"Boom--"</p><p></p><p>With an explosion, the Heavenly Crow Tribe Chief was blasted into a mist of blood!</p><p></p><p>The Heavenly God Square inside and outside suddenly fell silent!</p><p></p><p>Everyone was unable to react, staring blankly at the empty rope that had originally been hanging the Heavenly Crow Tribe Chief, now swaying slowly...</p><p></p><p>The supreme tribal chief of a peak tribe had just died like this...</p><p></p><p>Although they witnessed it with their own eyes, it still felt incredibly dreamlike!</p><p></p><p>Even the recent fall of so many cultivators from the human tribe and the Third Divine Official did not cause as much shock as the fall of the peak tribal chief!</p><p></p><p>Throughout the history of the Divine-Demon Battlefield, the peak tribal chiefs have basically never died like this before, and the Heavenly Crow Tribe Chief was the first!</p><p></p><p>Bi You, Ao Zhen Tian and other tribal chiefs' eyes were frantically trembling. The Heavenly Crow Tribe Chief who had just helped them break through the formation had died so easily...</p><p></p><p>"Tribe... Tribe Chief..."</p><p>"Father... Father..."</p><p></p><p>The upper echelons of the Heavenly Crow Tribe and the current holy son's faces turned deathly pale as they watched this scene, gradually, gradually, their eyes turned bloodshot!!</p><p></p><p>"Release my holy son!! You want my Heavenly Crow Body, right? Take it! My holy son will fight this old scoundrel to the death!!"</p><p></p><p>In the human tribe camp, the Heavenly Crow Tribe holy son fell to the ground, crying out in anguish, his voice hoarse.</p><p></p><p>Jian Wu Hui and others' expressions changed slightly, and the upper echelons of the Heavenly Crow Tribe were even more anxious! </p><p></p><p>They had just lost their tribe chief, the holy son couldn't have an accident as well!</p><p>Otherwise, the Heavenly Crow Tribe would be completely ruined!</p><p></p><p>"Holy son, shut up!" A Heavenly Crow Tribe elder roared.</p><p></p><p>But it was too late!</p><p></p><p>Shen Ting's gaze had already turned icy. A mere raven actually dared to call him an old scoundrel?</p><p></p><p>He suddenly reached out his hand!</p><p></p><p>In the human tribe camp, Jian Wu Hui and others hadn't even recovered yet, when the Heavenly Crow holy son was already sucked away by the force.</p><p></p><p>In an instant!</p><p></p><p>The Heavenly Crow holy son was firmly grasped in Shen Ting's hand!</p><p></p><p>The Heavenly Crow holy son was not afraid at all, and at this moment he had already lost his rationality in his anger!</p><p></p><p>He spat a mouthful of saliva onto Shen Ting's face, and then laughed maniacally:</p><p></p><p>Here is the full English translation of the Chinese excerpt:</p><p></p><p>"Haha, the mighty Heavenly God Lord has been spat on by this Holy Son!! Awesome!!"</p><p></p><p>Shen Ting wiped the saliva off his face, his face turning as black as ink. With a forceful hand, he instantly strangled the Holy Son of the Tian Ya Clan, then shouted, "Not a single one of the Tian Ya Clan will be left alive!"</p><p></p><p>Hearing this, Shen Yue and the others quickly responded, rushing towards the upper echelons of the Tian Ya Clan!</p><p></p><p>When the upper echelons of the Tian Ya Clan saw that their Holy Son had died, they snapped out of their daze and charged towards Shen Yue and the others, undaunted by death!</p><p></p><p>The Clan Lord had died, and the Holy Son had also died! </p><p></p><p>The Tian Ya Clan was now just an empty shell!</p><p></p><p>In an instant, a chaotic battle erupted!</p><p></p><p>The cultivators from all the clans hurried to the back, clearing the space.</p><p></p><p>Boom! Boom! Boom!</p><p></p><p>Although the battle was earth-shaking, Shen Yue and the other Heavenly God Clan members found it difficult to quickly subdue the powerful experts of the Tian Ya Clan. After all, the peak clans were not to be taken lightly.</p><p></p><p>Seeing this, Shen Ting became a little impatient. His eyes gleaming, he suddenly unleashed the pressure of the Divine Realm, sweeping towards the Tian Ya Clan.</p><p></p><p>In just a moment, all the upper echelons of the Tian Ya Clan were blasted to death!</p><p></p><p>The Heavenly God Plaza once again fell into silence!</p><p></p><p>Shen Ting sneered coldly, "I wonder who else dares to have any objections?"</p><p></p><p>In his eyes, killing such a large clan like the Tian Ya Clan was enough to intimidate the rest.</p><p></p><p>Sure enough, the cultivators from all the clans fell silent, no one daring to speak up.</p><p></p><p>Shen Ting said indifferently, "I won't force you today. After the Divine Realm Grand Ceremony is over, I'll give you three months. I hope you will voluntarily bring your Divine Bodies to my Heavenly God Clan. Don't make me have to do it myself."</p><p></p><p>"Understand?"</p><p></p><p>This statement was directed at the top hundred clans, as the Divine Bodies were mostly concentrated in their hands.</p><p></p><p>The top hundred clans unanimously replied with difficulty, "We... understand."</p><p></p><p>"Hahaha!" Shen Ting threw his head back and laughed arrogantly. Suddenly, his laughter stopped, and he sharply looked towards the Human Clan camp!</p><p></p><p>Jian Wuhui and the others immediately tensed up, their bodies tightening!</p><p></p><p>The cultivators from all the clans also had their pupils contract. It seemed that the Heavenly God Lord was about to target the Human Clan next!</p><p></p><p>Could it be that after the Tian Ya Clan, the Human Clan would also be completely wiped out?</p><p></p><p>"You humans are not bad, quite impressive. First, you destroyed my Third Divine Official, and then you even captured my Divine Son. Hehe."</p><p></p><p>Shen Ting chuckled mysteriously, but his smile was filled with icy coldness.</p><p></p><p>A long sword appeared in Jian Wuhui's hand, and he quickly placed it against the neck of the bound Divine Luo. Looking up at Shen Ting, he said coldly, "Shen Ting, since we humans have dared to come to the Heavenly God Clan, we are not afraid of you."</p><p></p><p>Shen Ting sneered, "Jian Wuhui, are you not afraid to come? You humans have so many cultivators, there's no way you can escape..."</p><p></p><p>Jian Wuhui's eyes flickered, about to speak, but Shen Ting interrupted, "Where is your Cyan Robe Sword Immortal? Why didn't he come today? Is he afraid of me, the Heavenly God Lord?"</p><p></p><p>Shen Ting's words echoed the thoughts of all the cultivators present.</p><p></p><p>Everyone looked at the Human Clan members with a puzzled expression.</p><p></p><p>Jian Wuhui replied calmly, "If even I am not afraid of you, how could the Cyan Robe Immortal be afraid?"</p><p></p><p>"Hehe." Shen Ting shook his head with a smile, then glanced at the Divine Luo, who had been constantly pleading with his eyes, and continued,</p><p></p><p>"Jian Wuhui, is my son your support?"</p><p></p><p>Jian Wuhui's eyes hardened, and the sword edge slightly neared Divine Luo's neck, causing a trickle of scarlet blood.</p><p></p><p>"That's right, the life of the noble Divine Son is in our human hands. Heavenly God Lord, surely you won't disregard the life of your own son, would you? That would truly break the Divine Son's heart..."</p>

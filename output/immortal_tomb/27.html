        <h1>Chapter 27</h1>
        <div class="content">
            <p>Here is the full English translation of the Chinese excerpt:</p><p></p><p>The crowd stood up and let out a long sigh, wiping the cold sweat from their foreheads.</p><p></p><p>The King of Lieshui looked at Chen Dadao and curiously asked, "Dadao, before we arrived, has the Master ever left the courtyard?"</p><p></p><p>Chen Dadao dryly chuckled and said, "Your Majesty, since the Master moved into the backyard, aside from the exorcism last time and last night, he has not taken a single step out, as far as I can see."</p><p></p><p>The meaning of Chen Dadao's last sentence was that the Master had great abilities, so even if he did go out sometimes, he wouldn't know about it.</p><p></p><p>"I see..."</p><p></p><p>The King of Lieshui rolled his eyes, then very inelegantly hooked his arm around Chen Dadao's neck, quickly turning him around to face away from the officials.</p><p></p><p>The officials were dumbfounded. Your Majesty, you are the ruler of the empire, please pay attention to your bearing!</p><p></p><p>What is it that you can't say openly?</p><p></p><p>What does this mean?</p><p></p><p>The King of Lieshui looked at the stunned Chen Dadao, then a hopeful and excited feeling rose in his heart as he asked in an extremely low voice, "Dadao, honestly tell this king, have you ever asked the Master about cultivating immortality?"</p><p></p><p>Chen Dadao was taken aback, recalling that night's conversation, but he had not mentioned it to the King of Lieshui. Instead, he forced a smile and said, "The Master said my foundation is not good, so I cannot cultivate immortality."</p><p></p><p>The King of Lieshui patted his shoulder and sighed lightly, "That's a pity."</p><p></p><p>He then asked, "Then can this king cultivate immortality?"</p><p></p><p>As the King of Lieshui, although he had interacted with disciples of the Qingyun Sect whenever demonic beasts appeared in the empire, those disciples came and went quickly, and he didn't even have a chance to bring up this matter.</p><p></p><p>What the King of Lieshui didn't know was that even if he did bring it up, it would be basically useless. Most of the so-called immortals he had seen were only at the Refining Qi stage... His own cultivation was not high, and he had little say within the sect.</p><p></p><p>"Your Majesty, I am just a mortal, how could I tell?" Chen Dadao said awkwardly, scratching his head.</p><p></p><p>The King of Lieshui nodded, hesitating for a moment before gritting his teeth and saying, "Dadao, you are close to the Master. If you have a chance, could you please mention it to him? Don't worry, as long as you bring it up, whether it succeeds or not, this king will reward you, wealth and position, you can choose."</p><p></p><p>Chen Dadao was slightly taken aback, then said regretfully, "Your Majesty, I'm sorry, I... can't help you."</p><p></p><p>The King of Lieshui paused, a hint of displeasure appearing on his face as he said, "Are you afraid that this king has the foundation for immortality cultivation, and you don't want to see me succeed?"</p><p></p><p>Chen Dadao's face showed anxiety as he said, "Your Majesty, it's not that I don't want to help you, it's just that I..."</p><p></p><p>Subsequently, Chen Dadao could only tell the King of Lieshui about that night's choice between begging Luchang Sheng to exorcise the demons or cultivate immortality and save his life.</p><p></p><p>The King of Lieshui heard this and was stunned.</p><p></p><p>Self-reproach quickly spread in his heart, a tingling, numb feeling.</p><p></p><p>He really should be ashamed of himself...</p><p></p><p>"Dadao, this king was wrong to suspect you, you... are a good man."</p><p></p><p>The King of Lieshui said, turning back and no longer mentioning asking him to bring it up.</p><p></p><p>He sighed inwardly, if he were to put himself in Chen Dadao's shoes, between the two choices, which would he choose - cultivating immortality or saving the people?</p><p></p><p>In the short term, he didn't have an answer.</p><p></p><p>"Your Majesty, now that the demonic beasts have been completely slain by the Master and the Ancient True Man, when shall we return to the capital?" Dong Ge asked.</p><p></p><p>Hearing this, the other officials also looked at the King of Lieshui, their eyes filled with doubt.</p><p></p><p>The demonic beasts were slain several days ago, yet the king had not mentioned returning until today, so what was the...</p><p></p><p>The King of Lieshui swept his gaze over them and said in a solemn voice, "That night, the Ancient True Man privately told this king after eradicating those dozens of demonic beasts, only saying that the demonic beasts..."</p><p></p><p>Here is the full English translation of the Chinese excerpt:</p><p></p><p>The matter has not yet been resolved, let us stay in this Moyu Town with the common people for now.</p><p></p><p>What?! It's not over yet?!</p><p></p><p>The officials' faces turned pale as they exchanged glances.</p><p></p><p>...</p><p></p><p>On the street.</p><p></p><p>As the man in blue robes passed by, he did not cause much of a commotion.</p><p></p><p>Because that night when he exorcised the evil, Lu Changsheng appeared in the sky, and given the distance and the darkness, the common people's vision could not clearly make out his face.</p><p></p><p>However, it still drew the attention of many commoners, for it was his bearing.</p><p></p><p>Lu Changsheng strolled casually on the street, looking around here and there.</p><p></p><p>Occasionally, he would stop by the stalls on the two sides of the street and buy some snacks to taste.</p><p></p><p>"Little girl, how much are these fruits?"</p><p></p><p>Lu Changsheng squatted down and asked about the unknown red fruits in the two baskets.</p><p></p><p>The little girl stared blankly at the man in blue robes, feeling a bit nervous, "Brother, how many do you want?"</p><p></p><p>Lu Changsheng's eyes flickered, and he smiled lightly, "If they are delicious, I can buy all of them. May I try one first to taste the flavor?"</p><p></p><p>"Ah?" The little girl was stunned, seeming a bit at a loss, but then she reacted with delight, "Of course, of course you can!"</p><p></p><p>Lu Changsheng nodded slightly, reached into the basket, and picked up a red fruit, which was small enough to be held between two fingers.</p><p></p><p>He then popped it into his mouth under the little girl's expectant gaze.</p><p></p><p>Lu Changsheng pursed his lips and smiled at the girl, "This fruit is sour at first, then sweet."</p><p></p><p>The little girl's black eyes widened, not understanding what this brother meant. How could she not know the taste of these red fruits, when she had secretly eaten them many times before?</p><p></p><p>She just wanted to know if this brother found them delicious. Even if he didn't buy all of them, if he could buy some, that would be good...</p><p></p><p>"Not bad, they're delicious. I'll take both these baskets. How much do they cost?"</p><p></p><p>Lu Changsheng asked the girl.</p><p></p><p>"Okay! Brother, please wait a moment, let me calculate it," the girl exclaimed happily, and then started carefully counting on her fingers.</p><p></p><p>Lu Changsheng was in no hurry, grabbing a handful of red fruits and eating them as he waited.</p><p></p><p>After a moment,</p><p></p><p>the girl opened her small palms towards Lu Changsheng. Her index fingers spread apart, she said seriously, "Brother, ten copper coins will do."</p><p></p><p>Lu Changsheng took fifteen copper coins from his pocket and handed them to the girl, then bent down to pick up the two baskets of fruits, ready to leave.</p><p></p><p>The girl stared blankly at the handful of copper coins in her hands, counting them carefully with both hands, then hurriedly said, "Brother, you gave me too much!"</p><p></p><p>Lu Changsheng paused, then softly said, "The extra five coins are for the carrying pole and baskets."</p><p></p><p>With that, he carried the two baskets of fruits and gradually walked away under the girl's bright gaze.</p><p></p><p>The carrying pole and baskets were hardly worth five copper coins...</p><p></p><p>The girl tightly clutched the copper coins in her hands. After all, she was just a child, and she quickly broke into a happy smile.</p><p></p><p>Today, she had actually earned fifteen copper coins! Wow!</p><p></p><p>"Xiao Tong, just now Grandma sold all the woven fabrics to the merchant, hehe, and Grandma bought your favorite scallion pancakes for you. But where are the red fruits?"</p><p></p><p>An old woman carrying a cloth bag walked over, her originally kind and smiling face turning pale.</p><p></p><p>Could it be that in just a short while, Xiao Tong had been tricked?</p><p></p><p>"Hehe, Grandma, all the red fruits were bought by a brother. Look, this is the fifteen copper coins he gave me."</p><p></p><p>Xiao Tong happily opened her palms to show the old woman.</p><p></p><p>The old woman was stunned. Fifteen copper coins for two baskets of red fruits? That was too much. She must have thought Xiao Tong didn't understand, and then hurriedly asked, "Where is he?"</p>

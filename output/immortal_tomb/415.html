        <h1>Chapter 415</h1>
        <div class="content">
            <p>Here is the full English translation of the Chinese excerpt:</p><p></p><p>Over the next few days, news of the impending arrival of the Ninth Prince and the Sage of the Qin spread throughout the City of Fragrant Clouds.</p><p></p><p>The citizens were not at all happy about this, but rather felt a sense of trepidation.</p><p></p><p>After all, the Ninth Prince, Yun Aoye, was well known for his lecherous and licentious nature.</p><p></p><p>The citizens all secretly prayed that when Yun Aoye came to the City of Fragrant Clouds, he would not bring ruin to the young maidens here.</p><p></p><p>The reason they prayed was that even if Yun Aoye were to defile all the young women in the City of Fragrant Clouds, the citizens would be powerless to stop him, for he was the Ninth Prince of the Cloud Mist Ancient Kingdom.</p><p></p><p>So some men who had daughters or wives of considerable beauty made them stay indoors for the duration of the Ninth Prince's visit - as long as he did not leave, their women would not be allowed to go out!</p><p></p><p>The women readily agreed to this.</p><p></p><p>They had no illusions of suddenly rising to prominence. They all knew that as powerless nobodies, if the Ninth Prince were to take an interest in them, they could only be taken, with no hope of any consequences. </p><p></p><p>Moreover, there was one thing that silenced many of the citizens - the Proclamation from the Prefect's Office forbidding anyone in the City of Fragrant Clouds from discussing the Sage of the Qin...</p><p></p><p>The people could somewhat understand the Prefect's reasoning, but they still felt uneasy about it.</p><p></p><p>The Sage of the Qin often came to the shores of Jade Pavilion Lake to freely play his heavenly music for them, but could the Sage of the Qin do the same?</p><p></p><p>And they had never even heard the so-called Sage of the Qin play the qin, so who knew who was truly the sage and who the immortal?</p><p></p><p>Of course, the common folk only dared to think these thoughts in their hearts - no matter what, the Sage of the Qin was on intimate terms with the Emperor, not someone they could openly discuss.</p><p></p><p>Outside the City of Fragrant Clouds, the city guards had already raised large banners and laid out a red carpet, standing in neat rows, making grand preparations.</p><p></p><p>At least on the surface, everything was ready, awaiting only the arrival of the Ninth Prince.</p><p></p><p>At the same time, many noticed that the city guards were scouring the city, conducting a thorough search.</p><p></p><p>A few perceptive individuals, connecting this to the Prefect's Proclamation, couldn't help but pale - could they be searching for the Sage of the Qin?</p><p></p><p>...</p><p></p><p>Meanwhile, in the Zhu Residence.</p><p></p><p>Zhu Guoyuan slowly approached the exterior of Zhu Qingqing's room, waving his hand at the startled maid Xiao Lian: "You may leave."</p><p></p><p>Xiao Lian bowed: "Yes, sir."</p><p></p><p>After Xiao Lian had left, Zhu Guoyuan spoke calmly towards the room: "Qingqing, all the preparations in the city are complete. The Ninth Prince will be arriving in the City of Fragrant Clouds soon, you should get ready."</p><p></p><p>After a long silence, a cold, resigned voice came from within the room: "I understand."</p><p></p><p>Zhu Guoyuan nodded slightly, opened his mouth as if to say more, then swallowed it back, finally sighing and turning to leave.</p><p></p><p>But at that moment, the door suddenly opened, and Zhu Guoyuan paused, turning to see Zhu Qingqing standing there, her face expressionless as she looked at him.</p><p></p><p>Zhu Guoyuan found himself suddenly unable to meet her gaze, glancing down at the ground as he said, "Qingqing, you've become thinner."</p><p></p><p>"My father would not push me into the fire pit for no reason," Zhu Qingqing suddenly said.</p><p></p><p>Zhu Guoyuan was taken aback by this, falling silent.</p><p></p><p>"I want to know the reason, even if it means my death. I hope you can let me die with understanding," Zhu Qingqing continued.</p><p></p><p>Zhu Guoyuan looked at Zhu Qingqing for a moment, then stepped past her into the room.</p><p></p><p>Seeing this, Zhu Qingqing knew Zhu Guoyuan was going to tell her something, so she closed the door behind her.</p><p></p><p>As Zhu Qingqing turned around, she saw Zhu Guoyuan carefully placing a transparent glass bottle on the table.</p><p></p><p>Floating inside the glass bottle was an unknown object, glowing with a faint green light.</p><p></p><p>"Because of this," Zhu Guoyuan said, his expression almost obsessive.</p><p></p><p>Zhu Qingqing looked puzzled. "What is this? How is this related to me?"</p><p></p><p>Here is the full English translation of the Chinese excerpt:</p><p></p><p>"Regarding what?" </p><p></p><p>Zhu Guyuan took a deep breath and said very solemnly:</p><p></p><p>"This item is called the Blue Lotus Seed. Once planted and carefully tended to, it will grow into a tree in a thousand years and bear fruit in ten thousand years."</p><p></p><p>"The effect of the Blue Lotus Fruit is that it can help a person establish the foundation to reach the Divine Martial Realm! In other words, as long as the person who consumes it does not die prematurely, they will definitely achieve the Divine Martial Realm in this lifetime!"</p><p></p><p>"And the fact that Father has this Blue Lotus Seed has already been discovered by Guo Xiong and Luo Qian... Now, do you understand, Qingqing?! Father is also completely helpless!"</p><p></p><p>Towards the end, Zhu Guyuan's tone became somewhat agitated.</p><p></p><p>At this time, Zhu Qingqing had already become dazed, staring blankly at the green glow in the glass bottle.</p><p></p><p>Blue Lotus Seed, Divine Martial Realm...</p><p></p><p>The rumor was that the King of the ancient Yunlan Country was a powerful cultivator of the Divine Martial Realm...</p><p></p><p>At this moment, Zhu Qingqing finally understood, understood why her father was doing this.</p><p></p><p>"Qingqing, the Divine Martial Realm, that's the Divine Martial Realm!!"</p><p></p><p>"This is a blessing bestowed upon our Zhu Family, an opportunity for our Zhu Family to take a great leap forward! As the head of the family, Father cannot possibly watch such an opportunity slip away in front of my eyes! Otherwise, our ancestors will not forgive me!"</p><p></p><p>"The Blue Lotus Seed is right in front of us now, visible and tangible, Qingqing, can you understand Father's feelings?!"</p><p></p><p>Zhu Guyuan's face flushed red, and his voice even became a little shrill.</p><p></p><p>Zhu Qingqing said with difficulty, "Father, you are thinking too simply. The Blue Lotus Seed is such a priceless treasure, the City Lord and the Luo Family Master will never allow us, the Zhu Family, to enjoy the fruits of it... Even if it means risking everything."</p><p></p><p>"I will find a way." Zhu Guyuan frowned and continued, "Qingqing, I'm sorry to trouble you, but as long as our Zhu Family can obtain the protection of the Ninth Prince, Guo Xiong and Luo Qian will not dare to do anything openly, they can only choose to compete with me secretly, after all, no one wants more people to know about the Blue Lotus Seed."</p><p></p><p>Zhu Qingqing nodded her head dejectedly, as if resigning to her fate.</p><p></p><p>As a daughter of the Zhu Family, she could not shirk the matters related to the life and death of the Zhu Family.</p><p></p><p>"I'm tired."</p><p></p><p>Zhu Qingqing said softly.</p><p></p><p>"Ah."</p><p></p><p>Zhu Guyuan paused, let out a sigh, and then left after putting away the glass bottle.</p><p></p><p>.........</p><p></p><p>At the same time, the city guards were searching all over the city, but to no avail.</p><p></p><p>A group of city guards were wandering around the shores of the Youthful Pavilion Lake, sighing:</p><p></p><p>"Alas, these days, we've searched every corner of Tianhang City, even the brothels, but we still haven't seen any trace of that Qin Xian."</p><p></p><p>"Yes, how are we going to report back to the Mansion Manager? It's really worrying."</p><p></p><p>"You think, maybe that Qin Xian has already left Tianhang City? Perhaps after hearing that the Qin Saint has arrived, he got scared and fled."</p><p></p><p>"Sigh, I heard that the place where the Qin Xian appears the most is around this Youthful Pavilion Lake, so we can only wait here and see if we can get any clues."</p><p></p><p>"Huh, brothers, when did that courtyard get built over there? Do you guys remember seeing it before?"</p><p></p><p>At this moment, one of the city guards suddenly spotted a courtyard and exclaimed in surprise.</p><p></p><p>The other city guards followed his gaze, and they all had puzzled expressions on their faces as well. The Youthful Pavilion Lake was considered a landmark of Tianhang City, and as city guards, they came here quite often.</p><p></p><p>But they had never seen this courtyard before.</p><p></p><p>To be able to build a house by the Youthful Pavilion Lake, it must be the residence of a powerful family in Tianhang City.</p><p></p><p>"Let's go over and pay a visit, have a cup of tea, and ask the owner of the courtyard if he has seen that Qin Xian around here these past few days."</p><p></p><p>"Okay, let's go, maybe we can get some information."</p>

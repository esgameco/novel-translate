        <h1>Chapter 47</h1>
        <div class="content">
            <p>Here is the full English translation of the Chinese excerpt:</p><p></p><p>In just a moment, these demonic beasts were slain to the last by Tong Xin. </p><p></p><p>Such common demonic beasts were no match for Tong Xin, who was in the foundation establishment stage.</p><p></p><p>"The immortal is truly formidable!"</p><p></p><p>"Yes, even our bows and arrows couldn't break through their defenses, but the immortal crushed them in the blink of an eye."</p><p></p><p>"Ah, this is the gap between us mortals and immortals."</p><p></p><p>"......"</p><p></p><p>The garrison soldiers sighed deeply.</p><p></p><p>"Many thanks to the ancient immortal!" Chen Dadao felt greatly relieved and expressed his gratitude.</p><p></p><p>Gu Helin waved his hand indifferently, but suddenly seemed to sense something, abruptly lifting his head to look towards the horizon!</p><p></p><p>His pupils then shrank sharply!</p><p></p><p>Two streaks of light were rapidly approaching them, their aura somewhat terrifying!</p><p></p><p>What's more important was that this aura... was demonic qi!</p><p></p><p>The crowd noticed Gu Helin's gaze and grave expression, their hearts jumping as they looked in the same direction.</p><p></p><p>At this moment, the two streaks of light had already reached outside the town wall, and two figures gradually became clearer.</p><p></p><p>A thin man in a gray robe and a fat man in a black robe.</p><p></p><p>Wisps of demonic qi were swirling around them.</p><p></p><p>The thin man in gray casually glanced at the corpses of the demonic beasts on the ground, then shifted his gaze to the town wall, sneering, "Qingyun Sect? You can only kill some low-level demonic beasts in our Demon Realm, can't you, Porcupine?"</p><p></p><p>The fat man in black rubbed his bulging belly and chuckled, "Tianlang, today I, the Boar, will devour this entire town!"</p><p></p><p>"Do as you please," Tianlang said with a dismissive wave.</p><p></p><p>On the town wall, it was silent. Chen Dadao and the others were filled with fear and couldn't help but move closer to Gu Helin.</p><p></p><p>"Master..." Tong Xin stared at the two figures hovering in the air with utmost seriousness.</p><p></p><p>From their previous words, he had obtained terrifying information - these two were most likely...</p><p></p><p>"Eighth-rank demonic cultivators," Gu Helin gritted out.</p><p></p><p>Chen Dadao and the other mortals naturally didn't understand, but the group of foundation establishment disciples had their pupils shrink sharply, their bodies trembling in fear.</p><p></p><p>Eighth-rank demonic cultivators, what a concept... They were on par with early Nascent Soul!</p><p></p><p>They were Nascent Soul Patriarchs, after all...</p><p></p><p>No wonder they were in human form, for eighth-rank demonic beasts had already acquired the ability to transform.</p><p></p><p>And they were called "demonic cultivators," no longer referred to as "demonic beasts."</p><p></p><p>"Well, well, your human eyes are quite sharp, aren't they? No wonder you're about to advance to the Nascent Soul realm," Tianlang said to Gu Helin with a forced smile.</p><p></p><p>Porcupine grunted and said indifferently, "Tianlang, enough with the nonsense, let's just kill them."</p><p></p><p>As he spoke, the demonic qi around him began to surge violently...</p><p></p><p>Chen Dadao and the others, even though they were simple-minded, could tell that the thin man and the fat man were up to no good and seemed to be very powerful.</p><p></p><p>"Master, what do we do!" Tong Xin exclaimed, his face paling. </p><p></p><p>Although... but he still didn't want to die.</p><p></p><p>Gu Helin also swallowed hard, his gaze constantly darting towards the lord's manor, but there was no movement from that direction at all.</p><p></p><p>"Save me, save me, save me!" Gu Helin cried out in his heart. Facing two eighth-rank demonic cultivators, even if there were a hundred of him, he wouldn't be able to defeat them.</p><p></p><p>"Hehe!"</p><p></p><p>At this moment, Porcupine suddenly opened his huge mouth towards the town wall!</p><p></p><p>Instantly, the sky and earth changed color!</p><p>A gigantic illusory boar covered in spines appeared in the sky, its size unimaginably massive. The next moment, its fangs and huge mouth...</p><p></p><p>Here is the full English translation of the Chinese excerpt:</p><p></p><p>Zhang Kai rushed over and pounced on him fiercely!!</p><p></p><p>[New 69 Book Bar]</p><p></p><p>Chen Dadao and the others were already terrified, because this giant pig phantom was really too big, covering half the sky. With just one bite, they even felt like the entire Moyu Town was going to be swallowed up!</p><p></p><p>This was a terrifying scene they had never witnessed before.</p><p></p><p>Gu Helin's face changed drastically, and he glanced towards the direction of the Zhenmain Mansion again, then gritted his teeth hard, making hand seals, while shouting loudly: "Tong Xin, lead everyone to retreat!"</p><p></p><p>Tong Xin obeyed the order and quickly led the group of disciples, including the dazed Chen Dadao, to retreat from the town wall.</p><p></p><p>At this moment, thousands of light swords appeared and circled around Gu Helin, their might and sharpness just like that night five years ago!</p><p></p><p>"Thousand Sword Technique, go!"</p><p></p><p>Swoosh swoosh swooshâ€”!</p><p></p><p>The thousands of light swords suddenly shot out! Even in broad daylight, it was as magnificent and grand as a meteor shower!</p><p></p><p>"Haha, just a peak Jindan cultivator, who gave you the courage?" </p><p></p><p>The Tianlang beside the Cipi Boar burst out with endless mockery. His gaze at the thousands of light swords was filled with disdain.</p><p></p><p>"Heng heng!"</p><p></p><p>The giant pig phantom let out a chilling pig's roar, and the next moment, the thousands of light swords were swallowed by its gaping mouth, not even lasting for an instant.</p><p></p><p>This scene made everyone shudder, even the powerful Gu Helin was unable to withstand it for a moment!</p><p></p><p>"Master!" Tong Xin's face turned deathly pale.</p><p></p><p>"An eighth-level demonic cultivator is indeed something I, Gu, cannot resist..." Gu Helin murmured to himself, looking somewhat dejected as he gazed at the approaching gigantic mouth.</p><p></p><p>At this moment, the corner of his eye still occasionally glanced towards the direction of the Zhenmain Mansion. He knew that as long as Lu Changsheng was willing to lend a hand, everything would not be a problem!</p><p></p><p>Seeing the oppressive giant pig phantom, everyone's hearts were about to stop, their pupils trembling constantly!</p><p></p><p>"Hehe, today, all of you will die!! This is what I, the Cipi Boar, say!! No one can help you!!"</p><p></p><p>The Cipi Boar sneered coldly.</p><p></p><p>"Oh ho, no one can help? You little demon's strength is not much, yet your arrogance is even greater than your grandpa turtle."</p><p></p><p>Just then, a mocking voice sounded from the town wall, making everyone's gaze pause.</p><p></p><p>Master? No, this was not the Master's voice and tone!</p><p></p><p>The next moment, the group saw countless jet-black light beams crossing in the sky outside the town wall, forming a semi-circular shape.</p><p></p><p>The shape... hmm, just like a turtle shell.</p><p></p><p>The giant pig phantom's gaping mouth suddenly bit down on it!</p><p></p><p>Crack crack crack crack crack...</p><p></p><p>Everyone was shocked to see a trace of fear and shrinking on the giant pig phantom's face, and then its sharp teeth were actually all shattered!!</p><p></p><p>Subsequently, the giant pig phantom crumbled, and those intersecting dark green light beams resembling a turtle shell remained completely unmoved...</p><p></p><p>"Poof!"</p><p></p><p>The Cipi Boar suddenly retreated dozens of meters, clutching his chest and spitting out a mouthful of blood, his eyes filled with disbelief.</p><p></p><p>"Cipi, are you alright?" Tianlang appeared by his side, his gaze of disdain now completely gone, replaced by solemnity.</p><p></p><p>"Who dares to interfere with my demonic affairs? Come out if you have the guts!" The Cipi Boar wiped the blood from the corner of his mouth and roared while looking around.</p><p></p><p>The town wall was silent for a moment,</p><p></p><p>Then, a stooped old man in black clothes gradually materialized on the town wall...</p><p></p><p>His eyebrows, beard, and neck were all black, and he had a small tuft of beard on his chin.</p><p></p><p>His dark skin had a glossy sheen.</p><p></p><p>He pinched one side of his mustache and looked at the two demons with a benevolent smile.</p><p></p><p>"I, the old turtle, naturally have the guts."</p>

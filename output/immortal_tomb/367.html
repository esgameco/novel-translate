        <h1>Chapter 367</h1>
        <div class="content">
            <p>Here is the full English translation of the Chinese excerpt:</p><p></p><p>Shenlo was stunned for a moment, then chuckled and said, "Not bad. It's the new book, right?"</p><p></p><p>Lu Changsheng nodded slightly, gave Shenlo a faint glance, then turned and walked towards the main entrance, quickly disappearing from everyone's sight.</p><p></p><p>Outside the Seven-Colored Jade Pagoda, it became completely silent as Shenlo's expression darkened.</p><p></p><p>"M-Master Shen, Lu Nan didn't mean anything by it, he was just asking..." Han Jinlong explained with a slightly pale face.</p><p></p><p>But he didn't really know what else to say.</p><p></p><p>Lu Changsheng's action was something that he and Jiang Wuxin hadn't anticipated.</p><p></p><p>Shenlo, however, didn't even look at Han Jinlong and indifferently said, "Next clan, continue."</p><p></p><p>The others like Ao Xing also fell silent, as it was clear that Shenlo seemed to be a bit angry.</p><p></p><p>Shortly after, one clan team after another silently entered the sensing barrier and entered the Seven-Colored Jade Pagoda, with no one daring to say more.</p><p></p><p>And the sensing barrier never showed any abnormalities again.</p><p></p><p>...</p><p></p><p>First floor of the Seven-Colored Jade Pagoda.</p><p></p><p>Clan teams from all tribes stood in their places, warily eyeing each other.</p><p></p><p>Before the peak-level major clans arrived, all teams had to wait, and could only officially begin after Shenlo's group had entered.</p><p></p><p>The clan teams were distributed roughly according to their rankings on the Myriad Clan Rankings.</p><p></p><p>Those with higher rankings naturally wouldn't interact with the lower-ranked ones.</p><p></p><p>On the human clan's side:</p><p></p><p>"Senior Lu, the hostile tribal teams are coming towards us," Fang Yun said cautiously.</p><p></p><p>Mo Liangqiu and the others also furrowed their brows, closely watching the dozen-odd hostile tribal teams approaching, knowing full well that this was provocation.</p><p></p><p>After all, they couldn't fight, not before the peak-level major clan teams arrived - no one could make a reckless move.</p><p></p><p>Lu Changsheng stood in place, nodding slightly, not even wanting to open his eyes.</p><p></p><p>At this moment, the movement of these dozen-odd hostile tribal teams quickly drew the attention of all the tribes present.</p><p></p><p>In an instant, everyone understood.</p><p></p><p>The enmity between these dozen-odd tribes and the human clan was well-known to all on the Divine-Demonic Battlefield.</p><p></p><p>Many gazes converged on the human clan side, all watching with interest.</p><p></p><p>Soon, the dozen-odd hostile tribal teams arrived and stood before Fang Yun and the others.</p><p></p><p>A delicate-looking young man stepped out from the ranks, glancing at Fang Yun's group and saying, "The human clan's performance in the previous Seven-Colored Jade Pagoda was the worst, wasn't it? Not even a single Jade Heart obtained, right?"</p><p></p><p>"Hehe, yes, Holy Son," a member responded.</p><p></p><p>Those present recognized the delicate young man - he was the Holy Son of the Viper Tribe, Yousen.</p><p></p><p>The Viper Tribe was the strongest among these dozen-odd hostile tribes targeting the human clan, ranking in the top 150 of the Myriad Clan Rankings.</p><p></p><p>From the positioning of these dozen-odd hostile teams, it was clear they were all rallying around the Viper Tribe's Holy Son.</p><p></p><p>Hearing this, Fang Yun and the others' expressions darkened.</p><p></p><p>Mo Liangqiu said with a flashing gaze, "As the Holy Son of the Viper Tribe, ranked in the top 150 of the Myriad Clan Rankings... it's quite laughable."</p><p></p><p>"What did you say?!"</p><p>"Watch your mouth! Or else when the peak-level major clans arrive and the competition officially begins, you won't even know how you died!"</p><p></p><p>Instantly, members from the dozen-odd hostile tribal teams pointed at Lu Changsheng's group and shouted angrily.</p><p></p><p>Yousen, however, just smiled faintly, staring at Mo Liangqiu and slowly extending his snake-like tongue to lick his lips. "Do tell, how is it laughable?"</p><p></p><p>Mo Liangqiu sneered, "Holy Son Yousen, you should take a good look - among the top 150 clans on the Myriad Clan Rankings, which one has a Holy Son or Holy Daughter as the squad leader?"</p><p></p><p>"The Holy Sons and Holy Daughters of the top 150 clans have already advanced to the Divine-Void Realm, but they can't even enter this Seven-Colored Jade Pagoda."</p><p></p><p>Here is the full English translation of the Chinese excerpt:</p><p></p><p>"Youshen Holy Child, you come and say, isn't it a bit ridiculous?" </p><p></p><p>Upon hearing this, Youshen's gaze turned ice-cold!</p><p></p><p>The other foreign tribes also had their pupils constrict, and they all looked towards Moliangqiu.</p><p></p><p>Goodness, although the words did not contain any vulgarity, it was almost as if they were scolding Youshen directly!</p><p></p><p>Yes, the Holy Children and Holy Maidens ranked among the top 150 of the Myriad Tribes were almost all from the Shenyou Realm.</p><p></p><p>And you, Youshen, as the Holy Child of one of the top 150 great clans, you are still only at the Shenxuan Realm... dragging down the lower limit.</p><p></p><p>If this is not trash, then what is?</p><p></p><p>"Insolent! How dare you, the human race's mongrels, insult the Holy Child of the Youshe Clan!" </p><p></p><p>Behind Youshen, a member of the Youshe Clan shouted with an icy expression.</p><p></p><p>"Boom!!!"</p><p></p><p>Suddenly, this Youshe Clan member exploded without any warning!</p><p></p><p>Deathly silence fell over the entire scene!!</p><p></p><p>All eyes stared dumbly at the pool of blood on the ground behind Youshen...</p><p></p><p>The high-ranking foreign teams just arriving from the outside were puzzled, not understanding why it was so quiet? </p><p></p><p>Their arrival should have attracted attention, right?</p><p></p><p>What... what happened?</p><p></p><p>At this moment, Youshen's expression became somewhat stiff, and he slowly turned his head, looking at the blood on the ground behind him, his gaze trembling uncontrollably.</p><p></p><p>He looked at his clan members, their faces also dazed.</p><p></p><p>Too sudden.</p><p></p><p>One of their Youshe Clan members at the late Shenxuan Realm just died like this?</p><p></p><p>"Who... who was it?" </p><p></p><p>Youshen looked around, his voice extremely low, even with a slight trembling of fear!</p><p></p><p>Fangxing, Moliangqiu, and the others were also bewildered, they didn't know what had happened either.</p><p></p><p>Could it be the Qixing Liuli Tower? </p><p></p><p>Otherwise, everyone here is at the Shenxuan Realm, and the highest is only at the peak of the Shenxuan Realm, who could instantly kill a Shenxuan Realm cultivator with a single move?</p><p></p><p>Perhaps the peak Shenxuan Realm cultivators of the top 10 clans could do it, but the top 10 clans haven't even arrived yet...</p><p></p><p>The scene fell into silence!</p><p></p><p>Everyone looked around, some not daring to speak, as they mostly suspected it was the doing of the Qixing Liuli Tower.</p><p></p><p>They were really afraid that the next one to explode might be themselves.</p><p></p><p>At this time,</p><p></p><p>the teams of the top 10 clans finally entered the Qixing Liuli Tower, and after discovering the eerie silence here, their puzzled gazes naturally turned towards Youshen.</p><p></p><p>Subsequently, their gazes converged on the large pool of blood behind Youshen.</p><p></p><p>Their eyes suddenly became sharp!</p><p></p><p>Hmm? Could it be that someone had violated the rules and engaged in battle before they arrived?</p><p></p><p>Afterwards, the teams of the Tianshen Clan, the Tun Shi Beast Clan, the Dragon Clan, the Phoenix Clan, and the other top 10 clans quickly walked towards Youshen.</p><p></p><p>Wherever they passed, the other foreign teams respectfully bowed.</p><p></p><p>Soon, the team leader of the Tianshen Clan looked at Youshen and directly asked, "What happened?"</p><p></p><p>Youshen regained his composure and slightly bowed, then took a deep breath and pointed to the pool of blood on the ground, saying, "Previously, a member of my Youshe Clan was standing here, but suddenly... he just exploded..."</p><p></p><p>Suddenly exploded?</p><p></p><p>The peak foreign tribe teams looked at each other, their expressions visibly becoming more grave.</p><p></p><p>"What realm was he in?" the Tianshen Clan team leader asked.</p><p></p><p>"Late... Late Shenxuan Realm," Youshen replied.</p><p></p><p>What? Late Shenxuan Realm?!</p><p></p><p>Instantly, whether it was the top 10 peak foreign tribe teams or all the other myriad tribe teams present, their pupils constricted!</p><p></p><p>One move to explode a Late Shenxuan Realm cultivator?</p><p></p><p>The top 10 peak foreign tribe teams had just arrived, so it must have been the doing of the Qixing Liuli Tower!</p><p></p><p>For a moment, some people were filled with trepidation.</p><p></p><p>Just then!</p><p></p><p>Luchengsheng finally opened his eyes, his calm voice resounding throughout the first layer of the Qixing Liuli Tower:</p><p></p><p>"From this moment on, except for the human race team, everyone else is to stand in place and not move. Whoever moves will die."</p>

        <h1>Chapter 48</h1>
        <div class="content">
            <p>Here is the full English translation of the Chinese excerpt:</p><p></p><p>The city wall was quiet at the moment. </p><p></p><p>The group of ancient cranes looked blankly at the uniquely-looking hunchbacked old man...</p><p></p><p>Cen Yuezhen, when did such a character come here again?</p><p></p><p>Not to mention anything else, just that move earlier was enough to shock them!</p><p></p><p>After all, the one in front of them was an eighth-level demonic cultivator on par with an Infant Celestial Ancestor!</p><p></p><p>"Who are you? How dare you interfere in the affairs of my demonic realm?!"</p><p></p><p>The porcupine growled hoarsely, he and the Heavenly Wolf were now facing a formidable enemy!</p><p></p><p>Because they couldn't see through this hunchbacked old man at all!</p><p></p><p>The old turtle stroked his beard, put his hands behind his back, his expression calm and his tone disdainful,</p><p></p><p>"How dare I interfere in the affairs of the demonic realm? If it weren't for not wanting that nuisance Hunhun to buzz in my ear like an annoying bee, just based on your actions today in disturbing my master's business, your demonic realm... even if it's overturned a hundred times, it wouldn't be enough to appease it!"</p><p></p><p>At these words,</p><p></p><p>Not only Heavenly Wolf and Porcupine, even the disciples like Ancient Crane Lin and Tong Xin were all shaken violently!</p><p></p><p>Outrageous, too outrageous!</p><p></p><p>Leaving aside the credibility of what this hunchbacked old man said, Ancient Crane Lin was now more curious about who this master he mentioned was?</p><p></p><p>Apart from that, just based on his earlier ability to counterattack an eighth-level demonic cultivator, it was enough to prove his strength, then his master behind him...</p><p></p><p>Terrifying to even think about.</p><p></p><p>"Arrogant!!!" </p><p></p><p>The porcupine glared at the old turtle and roared.</p><p></p><p>"Ridiculous words, overturning our demonic realm a hundred times? Not to mention our demonic lords, even if any one of the five great demonic kings came out, they could crush you!" Heavenly Wolf also growled unhappily.</p><p></p><p>But undeniably, their hearts were extremely grave at the moment.</p><p></p><p>However, even if they couldn't beat him, they still thought the other party definitely couldn't keep them here!</p><p></p><p>"Aiya, you two little..."</p><p></p><p>The old turtle raised an eyebrow, about to say something,</p><p></p><p>"Do you believe I'll seal your mouth? Bickering with two little demons, don't you find it embarrassing?" </p><p></p><p>A cool voice suddenly came from the direction of the Magistrate's Mansion...</p><p></p><p>The old turtle was startled and kept bowing and scraping, the calm expression on his face replaced by an awkward smile,</p><p></p><p>"Hehe, yes, yes, master, don't be angry."</p><p></p><p>Seeing the hunchbacked old man who had just been so arrogant now acting like a fawning dog,</p><p></p><p>Everyone was dumbfounded.</p><p></p><p>The voice of the master...</p><p></p><p>This powerful hunchbacked old man, was actually the servant of the master?!</p><p></p><p>The master he had mentioned earlier, was actually the master...</p><p></p><p>But why had they never seen this hunchbacked old man before?</p><p></p><p>"You, you..." </p><p></p><p>Porcupine and Heavenly Wolf snapped out of their daze, their gazes trembling as they looked towards the Magistrate's Mansion,</p><p></p><p>They were completely panicked now.</p><p></p><p>This hunchbacked old man... the master he had spoken of earlier actually existed, and was right here in this town!</p><p></p><p>If this hunchbacked old man was so strong, they couldn't even imagine how powerful his master must be?</p><p></p><p>"Run!!!"</p><p></p><p>Without hesitation, Porcupine and Heavenly Wolf retreated in unison!</p><p></p><p>"Want to run? Did you ask old turtle first? You two little..."</p><p></p><p>The old turtle's gaze was indifferent, with a wave of his hand, two streams of dark green light shot out, their speed terrifying!</p><p></p><p>Whoosh!!</p><p></p><p>Porcupine and Heavenly Wolf, in the midst of their escape, suddenly sensed something, and turned back abruptly, their faces changing drastically!!</p><p></p><p>The terrifying power contained in those two streams of dark green light was beyond their comprehension!</p><p></p><p>They had greatly underestimated this hunchbacked old man!</p><p></p><p>"You, who are you, no, we've cultivated for thousands of years to successfully transform, don't kill us, don't!!!"</p><p></p><p>Heavenly Wolf and Porcupine's eyes finally revealed infinite terror! Their tone even had a begging quality.</p><p></p><p>But,</p><p></p><p>It was too late.</p><p></p><p>The dark green light flashed and disappeared in an instant, and they suddenly lost consciousness, their bodies being ruthlessly destroyed into nothingness.</p><p></p><p>Here is the full English translation of the Chinese excerpt:</p><p></p><p>"Trash..."</p><p></p><p>The old turtle finally spat out the last two words it had not finished saying earlier.</p><p></p><p>Afterwards, without even looking at Gu Helin and the others, it disappeared from the city wall with a cold and cruel expression on its face.</p><p></p><p>"Gulp..."</p><p></p><p>Gu Helin and the others were shocked, frantically swallowing their saliva! </p><p></p><p>Just now...</p><p></p><p>Two demonic cultivators on par with Primordial Ancestor Elders were struck dead in a single blow...</p><p></p><p>So powerful...</p><p></p><p>"Tongxin! You and the other disciples help Chen Zhenzhus repair the city wall, I'm going to the Zhenzhu Mansion!" </p><p></p><p>Gu Helin snapped out of his daze, shaking his head forcefully, and then hurriedly left.</p><p></p><p>"Master, I want to go too!" Tongxin quickly said.</p><p></p><p>"No!" Gu Helin flatly refused.</p><p></p><p>"Master, please let your disciple come along~" Tongxin pleaded coquettishly.</p><p></p><p>"Sigh."</p><p></p><p>Gu Helin helplessly grabbed Tongxin and flew towards the Zhenzhu Mansion, his voice echoing back, </p><p></p><p>"The remaining disciples help Chen Zhenzhus repair the city wall."</p><p></p><p>The other disciples had bitter expressions on their faces. They also wanted to witness that awe-inspiring gentleman...</p><p></p><p>But they were not as favored as Tongxin, the direct disciple.</p><p></p><p>"Ahem, esteemed immortals, why don't you go rest at the Zhenzhu Mansion? We and the garrison can handle this." </p><p></p><p>Chen Datao smiled respectfully at the disciples.</p><p></p><p>"Yes, yes, esteemed immortals must be weary, please go rest, there's no need for you to do this laborious work." The steward quickly echoed.</p><p></p><p>"No, no, no! Chen Zhenzhus, you flatter us! Elder Gu has ordered, we dare not slack off, hehe."</p><p></p><p>"That's right, Chen Zhenzhus, we'll all work together to repair it quickly, we can fly and carry the mud and water much faster."</p><p></p><p>The disciples hurriedly waved their hands, laughing.</p><p></p><p>They had heard that the terrifying gentleman had been living in the Zhenzhu Mansion for some time, they dared not neglect Chen Datao.</p><p></p><p>Even if he was just an ordinary mortal...</p><p></p><p>Chen Datao and the steward cupped their hands respectfully, then exchanged a glance, a hint of pride surfacing in their eyes.</p><p></p><p>When had they ever looked this radiant?</p><p></p><p>After all, these immortals treated the King of the離水Kingdom with great aloofness...</p><p></p><p>But all of this was because of the gentleman.</p><p></p><p>"Garrison commander, notify the citizens, it's safe now!" Chen Datao laughed and waved his hand.</p><p></p><p>...</p><p></p><p>In the backyard of the Zhenzhu Mansion.</p><p></p><p>"It seems safe outside, you should go home now."</p><p></p><p>Lu Changsheng lightly pressed the old turtle's body under the table while smiling faintly at Xiao Tong.</p><p></p><p>The old turtle's eyes were bulging, in excruciating pain that penetrated to the bone. Its first two turtle claws were tightly covering its mouth, preventing it from letting out a miserable scream.</p><p></p><p>The pain was too much, a pain deep within the marrow!</p><p></p><p>"Brother, how did you know it's safe?" Xiao Tong asked confusedly.</p><p></p><p>"There's no more commotion, what do you think?" Lu Changsheng said.</p><p></p><p>"Oh, right!" Xiao Tong suddenly stood up, exclaiming excitedly: "The Zhenzhu Mansion is so powerful, defeating the terrifying demonic beast with just a mortal body!"</p><p></p><p>Lu Changsheng nodded in agreement.</p><p></p><p>"Then... brother, thank you for today! Next time, Xiao Tong will bring you some delicious fruits!" </p><p></p><p>Xiao Tong deeply bowed.</p><p></p><p>"Okay."</p><p></p><p>Lu Changsheng smiled and gently waved his hand.</p><p></p><p>Seeing this, Xiao Tong smiled at Lu Changsheng and then skipped out happily.</p><p></p><p>As soon as she left, Gu Helin's voice sounded outside,</p><p></p><p>"Sir, Helin requests an audience."</p><p></p><p>Lu Changsheng casually tossed the old turtle into the pond, lightly patting his mouth and yawning,</p><p></p><p>"Oh, I'm sleepy, I won't see anyone today."</p><p></p><p>Saying that, he leaned against the pavilion railing and closed his eyes.</p><p></p><p>And the fish in the pond had already shrunk into a corner, trembling in fear, the moment the old turtle fell into the water.</p>

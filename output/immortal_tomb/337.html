        <h1>Chapter 337</h1>
        <div class="content">
            <p>Here is the full English translation of the Chinese excerpt:</p><p></p><p>The Crimson Sun Palace.</p><p></p><p>The Lord of the Crimson Sun Palace was discussing matters with the elders when suddenly one of the elders' face changed drastically, and his body was about to collapse.</p><p></p><p>Immediately, the others looked at him with suspicion.</p><p></p><p>"Elder Nine, what is the matter that makes you so agitated?" the Lord of the Crimson Sun Palace asked with an unhappy expression.</p><p></p><p>This Elder Nine was really impatient. Couldn't he see they were in the middle of a discussion?</p><p></p><p>The elder's eyes were slightly reddened as he trembled and said, "Lord, the disciples from the Talisman Hall have sent a message... the Grand Elder's talisman is broken."</p><p></p><p>A hush fell over the hall.</p><p></p><p>Wasn't the Grand Elder sent by the Lord's order to that sect that suddenly appeared in their Crimson Sun Palace domain?</p><p></p><p>How could his talisman be broken?</p><p></p><p>Could it be...</p><p></p><p>Thinking of something, the eyes of the crowd became grim.</p><p></p><p>Bang!</p><p></p><p>The Lord of the Crimson Sun Palace slammed the table, shattering it into pieces, and slowly stood up, his face darkened as if ink could drip from it!</p><p></p><p>Even the corners of his mouth were twitching with anger.</p><p></p><p>The Grand Elder of his Crimson Sun Palace... to say he died just like that, without any warning.</p><p></p><p>Of course, he wouldn't think Elder Nine was joking. Who the hell would joke about such a thing!</p><p></p><p>"Hmph, to be able to kill my Crimson Sun Palace's late-stage Spiritual Treasure Realm Grand Elder, it seems that sect's strength is not bad... but... a bit too overbearing!" </p><p></p><p>Mozi said sternly, "They came into my Crimson Sun Palace's domain without even a greeting, and my Palace's Elder went to demand an explanation, but they killed him without even a word! Very good!"</p><p></p><p>"Go! I, the Lord, want to see what background that sect has, daring to be so arrogant towards us!" </p><p></p><p>As he was about to lead the equally indignant elders out of the hall, their eyes suddenly focused, seeing a young man in blue robes had appeared at the hall's entrance, quietly watching them.</p><p></p><p>"Was it you who killed my Palace's Elder?" Mozi narrowed his eyes, staring at Luchengsheng.</p><p></p><p>"Yes, I am the Lord of that sect," Luchengsheng said calmly as he stepped into the hall.</p><p></p><p>Under the bewildered gaze of the crowd, he sat down and poured himself a cup of tea, drinking it as if he were in his own home.</p><p></p><p>This arrogant attitude made Mozi's heart grow colder, but also wary.</p><p></p><p>Unfathomable...</p><p></p><p>And this person, after killing his Palace's Elder, dared to come to the Crimson Sun Palace alone. Truly...</p><p></p><p>Mozi's gaze flickered as he coldly said, "Since you are the Lord of that sect, then I must ask, was my Palace's Elder wrong in going there to demand an explanation?"</p><p></p><p>Luchengsheng: "No, he was not wrong."</p><p></p><p>The elders heard this and exchanged glances, at a loss.</p><p></p><p>"If he was not wrong, then why did you kill my Crimson Sun Palace's Elder?" Mozi's neck veins bulged, as if he could no longer hold back.</p><p></p><p>"I'm in a good mood today, so I'll tell you. Your Palace's Elder came and wanted to seize the core cultivation technique of my sect. Moreover, he even fought with my sect's Second Elder, almost killing him. Do you know about this?" Luchengsheng sipped his tea calmly.</p><p></p><p>He didn't come here with the intention of destroying the sect.</p><p></p><p>What? The Grand Elder tried to seize their core cultivation technique? And even almost killed their Second Elder?</p><p></p><p>Mozi swallowed, knowing that with the Grand Elder's temperament, he might have indeed done such a thing.</p><p></p><p>"So you think my Palace's Grand Elder deserved to die?"</p><p></p><p>Here is the full English translation of the Chinese excerpt:</p><p></p><p>"What do you mean?" Luchang Sheng asked with a smile.</p><p></p><p>The hearts of Moyang and the others were not at ease, but they did not doubt that the other party was telling the truth.</p><p></p><p>Because the young man in blue robes in front of them was too calm, too carefree, just like chatting casually.</p><p></p><p>It was precisely because of this that they felt a sense of profundity and mystery!</p><p></p><p>Before confirming the other party's true strength and backing, they could not rashly make a move, for in this battlefield of gods and demons, such an act might bring about a catastrophic disaster.</p><p></p><p>But when has such a figure appeared in the human race's territory?</p><p></p><p>He hesitated, because he had never seen or even heard of the young man in blue robes before.</p><p></p><p>"Sir, are you saying that our Daye Elder of the Crimson Yang Palace has died in vain?" Moyang asked in a stern voice.</p><p></p><p>"Yes, he died in vain," Luchang Sheng nodded lightly.</p><p></p><p>After a moment of silence, Moyang gritted his teeth and said, "Sir, give me a reason!"</p><p></p><p>What he wanted was simple - if the true strength of the young man in front of him matched the aura he was exuding, then his Crimson Yang Palace's Great Elder had indeed died in vain.</p><p></p><p>After all, the strong are respected, an eternal truth.</p><p></p><p>Who was right or wrong was secondary.</p><p></p><p>"There is no reason," Luchang Sheng said as he slowly stood up and walked towards the exit, his back as steady as Mount Tai. He continued, "Of course, if you want to make a move, feel free to do so. After all, I've already given you the chance to live."</p><p></p><p>His voice was light and calm, but it suddenly put immense pressure on Moyang and the others.</p><p></p><p>Moyang stared intently at the figure in blue, his eyes bloodshot. His fists in his sleeves clenched and unclenched repeatedly.</p><p></p><p>"Tap, tap, tap..." The footsteps gradually faded away.</p><p></p><p>Finally, when the figure in blue had completely disappeared, Moyang stumbled backwards, defeated, his entire being utterly dejected.</p><p></p><p>He... dared not take the gamble.</p><p></p><p>The oppressive feeling this person had given him was indescribable.</p><p></p><p>"Palace Master..." The other Elders were also drenched in cold sweat! Although they had remained motionless, it was as if they had just experienced a great battle!</p><p></p><p>Now, they were exhausted in both body and spirit.</p><p></p><p>Moyang took a deep breath and said in a hoarse voice, looking at the direction the blue-robed figure had disappeared, "He truly has an impressive bearing, surpassing even our Palace Master."</p><p></p><p>"Palace Master, you were only thinking of the Crimson Yang Palace. We understand that. Besides... this blue-robed cultivator, I have a feeling that he might truly be powerful... Able to slay the Great Elder, he is at least at the Deity Transformation Realm." An Elder said as he wiped the sweat from his brow.</p><p></p><p>Moyang swept his gaze across the Elders and sighed, "Perhaps even beyond the Deity Transformation Realm... I just don't know why I've never heard of this person before..."</p><p></p><p>"But no matter what, we are just small fry. In this battlefield of gods and demons, our human race is marginalized. Having one more powerful cultivator is a blessing for our human race."</p><p></p><p>The Elders' eyes gleamed with determination as they bowed and said, "The Palace Master's righteousness!"</p><p></p><p>"Haha haha!" Moyang threw his head back and laughed self-deprecatingly. "It's just that the Palace Master has become a coward, that's all."</p><p></p><p>With that, Moyang clasped his hands behind his back and walked out of the palace.</p><p></p><p>"You all stay here. The Palace Master is going to visit that sect."</p><p></p><p>"Palace Master! You..." The Elders' faces were filled with alarm.</p><p></p><p>"Hehe, don't worry, the Palace Master won't act rashly. I just want to see that sect for myself," Moyang said.</p>

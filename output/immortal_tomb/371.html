        <h1>Chapter 371</h1>
        <div class="content">
            <p>Here is the full English translation of the excerpt from the Chinese novel:</p><p></p><p>Hearing this, the young boy's face darkened, and he no longer spoke. Since this person did not want to kill him, there was no need for further communication.</p><p></p><p>Suddenly, Lu Changsheng said, "Although I won't kill you, is there a chance I could help you escape your predicament?"</p><p></p><p>The young boy suddenly raised his head, delighted, but then became dejected again. "Big Brother, don't joke with me. Your strength may be impressive, but breaking these chains is impossible..."</p><p></p><p>Although he had forgotten the appearance and identity of the one who had suppressed him, he still clearly knew how abnormal that person was.</p><p></p><p>At this moment, Lu Changsheng raised his hand and grasped a rusty chain, gently bending it.</p><p></p><p>Crack...</p><p></p><p>Hearing what sounded like the chain breaking, the young boy's expression paused, and he quickly looked at the chain in Lu Changsheng's hand.</p><p></p><p>He was shocked to see cracks in the chain!!</p><p></p><p>What did this mean?</p><p></p><p>As long as a little more force was applied, he could truly break free!</p><p></p><p>Wow, this was a true big shot!</p><p></p><p>Of course, it was also possible that the chain had become too fragile over the years, weaker than before.</p><p></p><p>But the boy had tried before, and he couldn't budge these chains at all, so it was clear that this person was truly a powerful figure.</p><p></p><p>Judging from this, this person's strength was even greater than his own.</p><p></p><p>"Doesn't seem too hard," Lu Changsheng said with a faint smile.</p><p></p><p>The boy snapped out of his thoughts, excited, and swung the chains around his arms, letting them clang, and pleaded, "Big Brother! Big Brother! You must save me and get me out of here!!"</p><p></p><p>Lu Changsheng put down the chain and glanced at him, "Why should I save you? What's in it for me?"</p><p></p><p>And while he could shatter all these chains, it would still take some time...</p><p></p><p>After all, there were so many chains.</p><p></p><p>This showed that the one who had suppressed this boy was indeed quite powerful!</p><p></p><p>Lu Changsheng gave a very high evaluation.</p><p></p><p>The boy hurriedly said, "Big Brother, I may not be good at anything else, but I can kill people. I can help you kill whoever you want!"</p><p></p><p>Lu Changsheng raised his eyebrows, "But you have committed such grave sins by killing dozens of lives in the great realms. If I were to release you, wouldn't that be a crime worthy of death?"</p><p></p><p>The boy anxiously said, "Big Brother, think about it, I've been suppressed and tormented here for countless years. Isn't that a price I've already paid?"</p><p></p><p>Lu Changsheng nodded, "That does count as a price paid."</p><p></p><p>The boy felt a bit happier upon hearing this.</p><p></p><p>But Lu Changsheng said, "However, it's still far from enough, those were dozens of lives in the great realms after all..."</p><p></p><p>The boy's expression changed slightly, his lips moving, not knowing what to say.</p><p></p><p>He admitted that he was an unparalleled demon.</p><p></p><p>But...</p><p></p><p>"And what if I let you out, and the first thing you do is turn against me? Is there a possibility of that?" Lu Changsheng asked softly.</p><p></p><p>He naturally wasn't afraid of this boy, he was just teasing him a bit.</p><p></p><p>This kind of unparalleled demon was quite interesting.</p><p></p><p>Lu Changsheng wanted to challenge himself, to see if he could redeem this unparalleled demon.</p><p></p><p>If he could redeem him and have him do good deeds after being released, then letting him out wouldn't be a big deal.</p><p></p><p>"No, no, I won't go against you, Big Brother. You are like a second father to me, and your strength is formidable. I'm no match for you!" the boy hurriedly said.</p><p></p><p>Lu Changsheng looked at him and said, "Have you ever thought that if I let you out, wouldn't I be offending a super expert for no reason?"</p><p></p><p>At this, the boy fell silent.</p><p></p><p>Putting himself in the other's shoes, he also understood the seriousness of this matter. If this person truly released him, it would indeed involve him in an unwarranted karmic entanglement.</p><p></p><p>Needlessly provoking an extremely powerful enemy.</p><p></p><p>"Don't rush, let me think it over," Lu Changsheng said calmly.</p><p></p><p>After saying this, he headed deeper in, also feeling a bit...</p><p></p><p>Here is the full English translation of the Chinese excerpt:</p><p></p><p>This tower, for some inexplicable reason, has a sense of familiarity to it.</p><p></p><p>...</p><p></p><p>Ten days passed in a flash.</p><p></p><p>Outside the Great Dao Demon-Subduing Tower, </p><p></p><p>the leaders of all the tribes stood up, looking at the tower's entrance with anticipation and tension.</p><p></p><p>The results of the various tribes' performances in this Seven-Colored Jade Tower were about to be revealed!</p><p></p><p>Even Shenlo and the others were intently watching the entrance.</p><p></p><p>The Jade Heart, a treasure that can help break through the Divine Profound realm, is something none of the tribes would refuse!</p><p></p><p>For them, adding even one Divine Profound cultivator to their tribe would strengthen their overall power.</p><p></p><p>The Jade Heart is even more important for the middle or lower-ranked tribes in the Myriad Tribes.</p><p></p><p>For example, the Fly Tribe, if they could increase their Divine Profound experts, their ranking on the Myriad Tribes list would instantly rise.</p><p></p><p>Meanwhile, inside the tower.</p><p></p><p>Fang Yin and the others were anxiously waiting for Lu Changsheng!</p><p></p><p>Because the time was about to run out, and when the time was up, they would all be teleported out of the tower, and the Seven-Colored Jade Tower would be completely closed!</p><p></p><p>Until the next time it opened.</p><p></p><p>At this moment, Fang Yin and the others were also extremely nervous, because all the Myriad Tribes members were watching them with predatory eyes!</p><p></p><p>After all, all the Jade Hearts in this Seven-Colored Jade Tower had been collected by their Human Tribe!!</p><p></p><p>"You all go out first, I still have some things to take care of in the tower," </p><p></p><p>Lu Changsheng's voice suddenly rang out in Fang Yin and Mo Liangqiu's minds.</p><p></p><p>Fang Yin and Mo Liangqiu looked at each other, their expressions grim.</p><p></p><p>Senior Lu actually wants to stay in the tower?</p><p></p><p>After going out, how should they explain this to the two Human Tribe leaders?</p><p></p><p>Just then, an irresistible force teleported all the Myriad Tribes members out of the place!!</p><p></p><p>...</p><p></p><p>Outside the Great Dao Demon-Subduing Tower.</p><p></p><p>The tower's surface shimmered, and then all the Myriad Tribes members were teleported out!</p><p></p><p>The Myriad Tribes leaders were first delighted, then stunned, because they saw their own teams all had gloomy expressions, without a trace of joy.</p><p></p><p>Fang Yin and the others were drenched in sweat, rushing to Jiang Wuxin and Han Jinlong's side.</p><p></p><p>"Eh, where's Senior Lu?"</p><p></p><p>Jiang Wuxin and Han Jinlong didn't see Lu Changsheng's figure at first, and their hearts shook.</p><p></p><p>"Venerable Wind Xing, King of the Golden Wheel, Senior Lu is still inside the tower..." Fang Yin said breathlessly.</p><p></p><p>Mo Liangqiu and the others also had pale faces, starting to tremble.</p><p></p><p>Because they knew what was about to happen next.</p><p></p><p>"What?! He's still in the tower!" </p><p></p><p>Jiang Wuxin and Han Jinlong's expressions changed abruptly, anxiously looking at the Seven-Colored Jade Tower.</p><p></p><p>At this time, the Seven-Colored Jade Tower had already closed, and their friend Changsheng might not be able to get out for 5 million years!</p><p></p><p>Just then, Shenlo's furious roar suddenly rang out:</p><p></p><p>"Human Tribe! You actually had someone from the Divine Profound realm sneak into the Seven-Colored Jade Tower, and plundered all the Jade Hearts of the Myriad Tribes! Audacious!"</p><p></p><p>Boom!!</p><p></p><p>At this time, the Myriad Tribes leaders, including Bi Qiong, Ao Xing, Feng Jun, and others, also learned what had happened in the tower, and their expressions changed drastically!!</p><p></p><p>All eyes were looking at Jiang Wuxin, Han Jinlong, and the others in disbelief!!</p><p></p><p>"Human Tribe, return the life of our Voidsnake Tribe's Holy Son!" The Voidsnake Tribe Chief, knowing the situation, roared with bloodshot eyes.</p><p></p><p>What...what?</p><p></p><p>Still immersed in the matter of Lu Changsheng, Han Jinlong and Venerable Wind Xing stumbled upon hearing this, almost unable to stand steady!</p><p></p><p>"Fang Yin, what's going on?" Jiang Wuxin asked hoarsely, facing the immense pressure.</p><p></p><p>Han Jinlong's face also turned pale, this day's events leaving them dazed.</p><p></p><p>Fang Yin trembled as he said, "Yousen was killed by Senior Lu... Because of Senior Lu, the Jade Hearts... are all in the hands of our Human Tribe..."</p><p></p><p>Jiang Wuxin and Han Jinlong suddenly felt the world spinning, an incomparable sense of dread sweeping through their entire beings!</p><p></p><p>The Human Tribe, it's over!</p>

        <h1>Chapter 299</h1>
        <div class="content">
            <p>Here is the full English translation of the Chinese excerpt:</p><p></p><p>Outside the Sand Secret Realm, the crowd that had been observing dispersed like the receding tide towards the Ancient Wasteland Royal City.</p><p></p><p>Everyone knew that the Sand Secret Realm was just the appetizer, a screening process to select fifteen hundred people. The real show would be at the Heavenly Prodigy Tea Gathering.</p><p></p><p>The Tea Gathering, it sounded so harmonious, but in reality, the Tea Gathering would be filled with overt and covert struggles. After all, deciding the top ten at the Tea Gathering was no laughing matter.</p><p></p><p>Blood Demon Moon glanced at Lu Changsheng out of the corner of her eye, then silently headed towards the Ancient Wasteland Royal City.</p><p></p><p>"Hehe, Blood Immortal Lady, how about we cooperate for the Tea Gathering five days from now?" </p><p></p><p>Just then, Nangong Wenxin approached Blood Demon Moon, fanning himself elegantly.</p><p></p><p>"Nangong, this young master also wants to cooperate with the Blood Immortal Lady, why don't you make way?" </p><p></p><p>Lai Qing quickly followed, smiling at Blood Demon Moon.</p><p></p><p>Hearing this, Nangong Wenxin's face flashed with displeasure, but he quickly composed himself, smiled without saying a word, and kept his eyes fixed on Blood Demon Moon.</p><p></p><p>At the upcoming Heavenly Prodigy Tea Gathering, the heavenly prodigies would generally seek cooperative partners, as going at it alone would be rather difficult. </p><p></p><p>The highly sought-after top-tier heavenly prodigy ranked fifth, Blood Moon, was undoubtedly the best cooperative partner. Her background may be temporarily mysterious, but more importantly, Blood Moon was the only female among the top ten. And she was a great beauty to boot.</p><p></p><p>Although her lower face was veiled and not visible, her enchanting eyes and slender figure were enough to captivate.</p><p></p><p>In the distance, Evil Exterminator and Invisible Shadow clicked their tongues in annoyance. They had also wanted to cooperate with Blood Moon, but now that they were beaten to it, they immediately disappeared.</p><p></p><p>Blood Demon Moon withdrew her gaze from Lu Changsheng and without even sparing a glance at Nangong Wenxin and Lai Qing, indifferently said a single sentence before vanishing.</p><p></p><p>"Worthy?"</p><p></p><p>Nangong Wenxin and Lai Qing's faces suddenly stiffened.</p><p></p><p>After a moment of silence,</p><p></p><p>Nangong Wenxin suddenly smiled, waving his folding fan, and sneered at Lai Qing, "That's right, what are you, the Lai Clan young master, worthy of cooperating with the Blood Immortal Lady?"</p><p></p><p>Lai Qing's anger flared, and he shouted, "Nangong Wenxin, stop with the sarcasm. The Blood Immortal Lady clearly meant you! You effeminate man, you're not worthy!"</p><p></p><p>Nangong Wenxin's face darkened. "I'm talking about you! And who are you calling effeminate? Say that again if you dare!"</p><p></p><p>Lai Qing coldly smiled, not wanting to get further entangled with him, and vanished in a flash.</p><p></p><p>At the same time, outside the Sand Secret Realm, most of the people had already left.</p><p></p><p>Only Lu Changsheng, Li Shuoyan, and the people from the Fu and Liu clans remained.</p><p></p><p>And the Miu Clan as well.</p><p></p><p>That's when Miu Hantian and the others moved, approaching Lu Changsheng's side.</p><p></p><p>Liu Tu, Fu Liangcai, and the others were instantly alarmed, as if facing a great enemy!</p><p></p><p>But soon, their eyes bulged in shock.</p><p></p><p>"Young Master Hantian of the Miu Clan and the elders pay respects to the esteemed one."</p><p></p><p>Miu Hantian took the lead, bowing ninety degrees in salute.</p><p></p><p>The Miu Clan elders also hurriedly knelt down. "Greetings, esteemed one!"</p><p></p><p>At this moment, the north wind howled, the only sound being the gulping of Liu Tu and the others.</p><p></p><p>They knew full well that the person before them was from a royal clan!</p><p></p><p>What was going on?</p><p></p><p>Involuntarily, their gaze shifted back to Lu Changsheng's back, realizing they had greatly underestimated him.</p><p></p><p>Compared to Liu Tu and the others, Fu Shiyu and the three were even more bewildered. The Miu Clan? </p><p></p><p>The Miu Lun who had been killed by their senior, should he be the young master of the Miu Clan?</p><p></p><p>But but... how did their senior know the Miu Clan?</p><p></p><p>Fu Shiyu and the others felt a tightness in their hearts, unsure of how the Miu Clan elders would react if they knew their son had been killed by their senior.</p><p></p><p>Boom.</p><p></p><p>Here is the full English translation of the Chinese excerpt:</p><p></p><p>At this time, the anxious Miu Hantian knelt down and said in a trembling voice: "Your Highness, your unfilial son has offended you, and he deserves to die. Today, Hantian has not left yet, and he wants to apologize to you in person."</p><p></p><p>The reason he did not leave with the elders of his family immediately was that he was too afraid in his heart, and he still had some uncertainty.</p><p></p><p>After all, it was not the same as facing each other directly in the Xuantian Stone.</p><p></p><p>"Ah?"</p><p></p><p>Fu Shiyu and the other two were dumbfounded, so they knew that Miu Lun had been killed by the senior?</p><p></p><p>For their own son to be killed and still come to apologize, this was the first time they had seen such a thing.</p><p></p><p>Lu Changsheng waved his sleeve to lift Miu Hantian and the others, then turned around and disappeared without a word.</p><p></p><p>Li Shuyan hurriedly followed.</p><p></p><p>The tense nerves of Miu Hantian and the others immediately relaxed, they knew that this matter was completely over today.</p><p></p><p>They also felt deeply moved, in fact, they were not in the right in this matter.</p><p></p><p>To be honest, the great master of the Eight Ancient Clans, who was a top-tier powerhouse, was peeped at by them using the Xuantian Stone, and it would be normal for him to overthrow their Miu Clan.</p><p></p><p>Indeed, the great master of the Eight Ancient Clans had a broad mind and was too lazy to argue with these minor characters.</p><p></p><p>"Gulp, gulp, gulp..."</p><p></p><p>Liu Tu, Fu Liancai, and Liu Qing snapped out of their daze, swallowing their saliva, trying to moisten their dry throats.</p><p></p><p>"Hmm?" Miu Hantian finally noticed Liu Tu and the others, and then smiled politely: "Gentlemen, would you like to come to the Miu Clan and stay for a while?"</p><p></p><p>These people seemed to have a good relationship with that senior in blue, so it's better to make a good relationship first.</p><p></p><p>Everyone hurriedly bowed and returned the greeting.</p><p></p><p>"Cough, cough, cough, Clan Leader Miu, we... we won't..." Liu Tu said awkwardly.</p><p></p><p>Although he was the venerable ancestor of the Liu Clan in Jinyun City, in front of such a figure as Miu Hantian, he did not dare to be presumptuous.</p><p></p><p>The person in front of him might kneel and bow in front of the senior in blue, but to them, he was truly a great figure!</p><p></p><p>Miu Hantian's eyes flashed slightly, pretending to be unhappy on his face: "Gentlemen, are you unwilling to give me face?"</p><p></p><p>"We dare not, we dare not! Clan Leader Miu, you are too kind, we..." Liu Tu and the others hurriedly waved their hands.</p><p></p><p>"That's good then, gentlemen, come with me back to the Miu Clan, and stay there for the next five days, it's not convenient to stay in the inn outside."</p><p></p><p>In this way, unable to refuse the kind invitation, Liu Tu and the others had no choice but to follow Miu Hantian to the Miu Clan.</p><p></p><p>On the way, Miu Hantian chatted and joked with them, being very polite, and of course, intentionally or unintentionally, he was all asking about the senior in blue.</p><p></p><p>Liu Tu and the others sighed deeply in their hearts.</p><p></p><p>...</p><p></p><p>In the Zhou Clan, in the study.</p><p></p><p>Slap!</p><p></p><p>Zhou Zhenjiang slapped Zhou Yuan's face and growled, "Trash, as a Heaven's Chosen in the Divine Yang Realm, you can't even obtain the qualification to attend the Heaven's Chosen Tea Gathering! You have completely ruined the reputation of our Zhou Clan!"</p><p></p><p>Zhou Yuan covered his face, complaining pitifully, "Father, I didn't want to either, you don't know how strange that bald guy was..."</p><p></p><p>Zhou Yuan hadn't even finished speaking when Zhou Zhenjiang became even angrier, shouting, "How strange could he be? When I investigated at the time, that bald guy was only in the early stage of the Divine Yang Realm as well. As fellow early Divine Yang Realm cultivators, even if you couldn't defeat him, you should have been able to run away, right?"</p><p></p><p>He actually crushed the jade token, truly a...waste.</p><p></p><p>Zhou Yuan sighed, "Father, when that bald guy fought with me, even my vital energy was useless, he relied purely on his physical body..."</p><p></p><p>He then went on to tell Zhou Zhenjiang the detailed account of his battle with Li Shuyan in the Sand Secrets Realm.</p><p></p><p>After a moment, Zhou Zhenjiang's eyes flickered,</p><p></p><p>"Body cultivation?"</p>

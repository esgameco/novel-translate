        <h1>Chapter 458</h1>
        <div class="content">
            <p>Here is the full English translation of the Chinese excerpt:</p><p></p><p>Hmm?</p><p></p><p>Hongwu Jue and the group of clan leaders were examining Lu Changsheng, when they suddenly heard this statement, and their pupils slightly constricted.</p><p></p><p>What did they find out from the examination...</p><p></p><p>They had never seen a person who spoke so bluntly before, especially in this kind of situation.</p><p></p><p>On the side, Ye Nantian saw the atmosphere becoming a bit strange, so he hurriedly cupped his hands and chuckled dryly:</p><p></p><p>"Clan Leader Hong, and everyone else, please don't be offended. Elder Lu has always been straightforward in character, quick-tongued, but what he said definitely does not have any other meaning behind it, please forgive him."</p><p></p><p>Hearing Ye Nantian's explanation, Hongwu Jue's expression eased up a bit, his gaze shifting away from Lu Changsheng, without any intention to dwell on it.</p><p></p><p>After all, the confrontation with the He Clan was imminent, the Ye Clan could not afford to offend them, having one more top-tier ancient clan as an ally would mean one more hope.</p><p></p><p>Moreover, there were only forty top-tier ancient clans present currently, which meant that the other sixty clans had almost all sided with the He Clan.</p><p></p><p>There was no possibility of the remaining top-tier ancient clans still being neutral, because everyone knew what it meant to come to the Hong Clan or not.</p><p></p><p>Ye Nantian saw Hongwu Jue's expression relaxing, and he also felt a bit relieved. He then glanced at Lu Changsheng, who had unknowingly closed his eyes and was leaning to the side, as if he was in his own home.</p><p></p><p>This made Ye Nantian and the two elders feel extremely nervous.</p><p></p><p>Ye Nantian wanted to transmit something to Lu Changsheng, but after thinking about it, he decided not to. </p><p></p><p>Just let Elder Lu be, after all, Ye Nantian knew that at this critical juncture, the Hongwu Clan had no time to dwell on these trivial matters.</p><p></p><p>The others also saw Lu Changsheng's posture of leaning to the side with his eyes closed, as if he was sleeping, and they couldn't help but twitch the corners of their mouths...</p><p></p><p>This person, where on earth did the Ye Clan find him from...</p><p></p><p>Aren't they afraid that he will lead them into a deep abyss?</p><p></p><p>Hongwu Jue took a light breath, although he was a bit displeased in his heart, but at the moment he really didn't have time to waste on such trivial matters, there were more important things to discuss!</p><p></p><p>He simply didn't want to glance in Lu Changsheng's direction again, and swept his gaze across the crowd, speaking in a deep voice:</p><p></p><p>"Clan leaders, I've summoned you all to the Hongwu Clan, I'm sure you all know the reason why..."</p><p></p><p>The clan leaders saw Hongwu Jue turning to the main topic, their expressions instantly becoming extremely solemn, some of the clan leaders even sighed and lamented in their hearts.</p><p></p><p>"Clan Leader Hongwu, we just want to know one thing, is it true that the Ouyang Clan has sided with the He Clan?"</p><p></p><p>At this time, a clan leader stood up and asked in a solemn voice, voicing the thoughts of the others.</p><p></p><p>Hongwu Jue's brows furrowed, and he sighed, "Yes, that's true."</p><p></p><p>Upon hearing Hongwu Jue's own admission, the expressions of the crowd became unsightly, their gazes changing wildly.</p><p></p><p>Ye Nantian and the two Ye Clan elders also sighed inwardly, this had now been completely confirmed.</p><p></p><p>"Clan Leader Hongwu, do you know why the Ouyang Clan is supporting the He Clan? The Ouyang Clan is one of the three super ancient clans, I refuse to believe that they are unaware of the serious consequences of refining the Myriad World Calamity Body!"</p><p></p><p>A clan leader exclaimed angrily.</p><p></p><p>Normally, they would not dare to discuss the Ouyang Clan so openly behind their back, but in this situation, they really couldn't hold back their feelings.</p><p></p><p>Ye Nantian and the other clan leaders quickly looked at Hongwu Jue, they also wanted to know what price the He Clan had paid to make the Ouyang Clan change their mind.</p><p></p><p>But Hongwu Jue shook his head, "I've asked the Ouyang Clan leader before why, but he didn't tell me."</p><p></p><p>The expressions of the crowd turned cold, and they were now very dissatisfied with the Ouyang Clan. Originally, with two super ancient clans, the He Clan's attempt to refine the Myriad World Calamity Body would have been extremely difficult, but now...</p><p></p><p>"Alright, everyone, let's not talk about this for now. The reason I've summoned you all here today is to tell you a major news, you need to be mentally prepared."  Hongwu Jue said.</p><p></p><p>Here is the full English translation of the Chinese excerpt:</p><p></p><p>Waving his hand, he said, "Patriarch Hong, please speak."</p><p></p><p>Ye Nantian was the first to cupped his hands and said, "Patriarch Hong, please continue."</p><p></p><p>Hong Wujue nodded and then said in a deep voice, "Esteemed Patriarchs, I have received news that the He Clan will be holding the ritual to refine the Calamity Body of the Myriad Worlds in two and a half months."</p><p></p><p>What?! </p><p></p><p>The Patriarchs seemed to be shocked and abruptly stood up, their eyes filled with agitation.</p><p></p><p>Two and a half months? So soon??</p><p></p><p>"That's right, the time is so pressing. I have summoned you Patriarchs today not only to inform you of this matter, but also to formulate a plan of attack for the day the He Clan refines the Calamity Body. We must absolutely stop the He Clan and defend our ancestral lands!"</p><p></p><p>Hong Wujue shouted forcefully.</p><p></p><p>However, the Patriarchs kept shaking their heads, not optimistic about the plan.</p><p></p><p>Seeing this, Hong Wujue coldly said, "I know what you Patriarchs are thinking - you are wary of the Ouyang Clan and those sixty-odd top-tier Ancient Clans. But do you really think we will be defeated?"</p><p></p><p>"How could my Hong Clan be so foolish as to knowingly go to our deaths?"</p><p></p><p>Hearing this, the crowd perked up. That made sense - who would willingly go to their death? Moreover, the Hong Clan was a super Ancient Clan, so they must have some hidden trump cards, right?</p><p></p><p>"Hehe, it's not that we have some hidden trump cards, but rather that your vision is too limited. The Vast Ancient Realm is not just the super Ancient Clans and top-tier Ancient Clans, you know. The massive number of middle and lower-tier Ancient Clans combined is also a formidable force..."</p><p></p><p>Hong Wujue smiled lightly, "If that's the case, do you Patriarchs still think we have no chance of victory at all?"</p><p></p><p>"Furthermore, on the day of the refinement, the He Clan's Patriarch will be completely occupied with refining the Calamity Body, so he won't be able to intervene. We only need to obstruct and disrupt their refinement, not fight to the death. Isn't there a chance for us?"</p><p></p><p>Hearing this, the eyes of the Patriarchs, including Ye Nantian, lit up with hope.</p><p></p><p>Yes, as Hong Wujue said, obstructing the He Clan's refinement plan was not an impossible task.</p><p></p><p>"Hehe." Seeing the Patriarchs' expressions filled with renewed confidence and hope, Hong Wujue nodded in satisfaction, then said:</p><p></p><p>"That's all for today. You should all go back and quickly consolidate the middle and lower-tier Ancient Clans in your respective regions, then await the day of the refinement. I will summon you all when the time comes."</p><p></p><p>"Yes, Patriarch Hong, then we shall take our leave."</p><p></p><p>The crowd stood up and cupped their hands in farewell.</p><p></p><p>Hong Wujue nodded, glanced at the still sleeping Lu Changsheng, snorted, and then disappeared from the hall.</p><p></p><p>"Elder Lu, wake up, it's time for us to leave," Ye Nantian transmitted to Lu Changsheng awkwardly.</p><p></p><p>Lu Changsheng opened his eyes, then rubbed the corners of his eyes and stood up. "Is it over? Then let's go back."</p><p></p><p>Suddenly, Hong Wujue's voice resounded in the hall again:</p><p></p><p>"Oh, by the way, I clearly remember which forty-odd top-tier Ancient Clans came today. If any one of them is missing later on... hehe."</p><p></p><p>Some Patriarchs' expressions changed slightly, and they abandoned the idea of defecting.</p><p></p><p>...</p><p></p><p>On the way back to the Ye Clan, Ye Nantian recounted to Lu Changsheng everything Hong Wujue had said, then cleared his throat and asked, "Elder Lu, in two and a half months, will you stay in the clan or go with us to the He Clan?"</p><p></p><p>Lu Changsheng smiled and said, "I will go to the He Clan."</p><p></p><p>Ye Nantian and the two other Elders saw Lu Changsheng's unhesitating response, and their eyes suddenly turned red, deeply moved.</p><p></p><p>Elder Lu is truly kind. Even though he is just a guest, they couldn't really say anything if he just watched from the sidelines, but Elder Lu is filled with a sense of justice.</p><p></p><p>...</p><p></p><p>For the fastest updates on this flawless novel, please visit www.feixs.com.</p><p></p><p>For mobile access, please go to https://m.feixs.com/chapter-45751-38225577.</p>

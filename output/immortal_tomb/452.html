        <h1>Chapter 452</h1>
        <div class="content">
            <p>Here is the full English translation of the excerpt from the Chinese novel:</p><p></p><p>Ye Zhuiyue's tone caused Ye Nantian to shudder a bit, but he was already used to the fiery temper of the Old Patriarch.</p><p></p><p>Although the Elder and the Old Patriarch were brothers, their personalities were completely different. </p><p></p><p>Compared to the Old Patriarch, the Elder was usually lazy and indolent, but his temperament was much better.</p><p></p><p>"Old Patriarch, just now Zhou Clan's Zhou Yuan came to our Ye Clan, and Zhou Yuan wants us to choose a side," Ye Nan said.</p><p></p><p>Choose a side? What side?</p><p></p><p>Ye Zhuiyue's brows furrowed slightly as he exchanged a glance with Ye Zhuixing, then looked at Ye Nantian and scolded, "Can you speak more clearly? As the clan leader, don't you have the language organization ability? If it were up to me, I'd rather have Ating be the clan leader!"</p><p></p><p>The Ating that Ye Zhuiyue mentioned was Ye Xunwang's late father, Ye Ting.</p><p></p><p>Ye Nantian's cold sweat immediately broke out, not because his language organization ability was poor, but because he had a shadow in his heart towards Ye Zhuiyue, and he couldn't help but feel deeply afraid every time he faced Ye Zhuiyue.</p><p></p><p>"Old Patriarch, this matter is about the Millennium Calamity Body of the He Clan. Many ancient clans in the Void Ancient Realm have secretly begun to choose sides, and the Zhou Clan has chosen to stand with the He Clan... Then Zhou Yuan came today to ask me, to ask our Ye Clan's intentions..."</p><p></p><p>Ye Nantian, facing Ye Zhuiyue's piercing gaze, laboriously explained the matter clearly.</p><p></p><p>Oh?</p><p></p><p>Hearing this, Ye Zhuiyue and Ye Zhuixing's brows deeply furrowed!</p><p></p><p>How could this be?</p><p></p><p>Logically speaking, all ancient clans should rush to stop the He Clan from refining the Millennium Calamity Body, but now there is talk of choosing sides? </p><p></p><p>And the superior ancient clan like the Zhou Clan has actually chosen to stand with the He Clan, what's the catch in this?</p><p></p><p>Do they really think the Void Ancient Realm belongs to the He Clan alone?</p><p></p><p>"Nantian, I suppose you still have more to say?" Ye Zhuixing suddenly asked as he was pondering.</p><p></p><p>"The Elder is so insightful!" Ye Nantian hurriedly flattered.</p><p></p><p>Slap!</p><p></p><p>Unexpectedly, Ye Zhuiyue suddenly slapped him on the head, glaring at him and sternly saying, "If I ever feel the urge to kill, you better not regret it."</p><p></p><p>Ye Nantian's face turned pale, panicking for a moment, then quickly said in a solemn tone:</p><p></p><p>"Old Patriarch, don't be angry. When Zhou Yuan left, he told me a secret, saying that not only his Zhou Clan, but even the Ouyang Clan, a super ancient clan, has sided with the He Clan!!"</p><p></p><p>What?!</p><p></p><p>Ye Zhuiyue finally couldn't sit still, abruptly standing up, his expression wildly changing!</p><p></p><p>Ye Zhuixing's expression was also filled with gravity!</p><p></p><p>How did the situation turn out this way?</p><p></p><p>If even the Ouyang Clan has sided with the He Clan, then who else can stop the He Clan from refining the Millennium Calamity Body?</p><p></p><p>Relying on the Hong Clan alone? Clearly unrealistic!</p><p></p><p>The whole event has suddenly become shrouded in mystery. What kind of bewitching potion did the He Clan use, that even the Ouyang Clan has sided with them?</p><p></p><p>Was it a threat or some kind of benefit they offered?</p><p></p><p>Threats are unrealistic, as the Ouyang Clan is also a super ancient clan, not inferior to the He Clan at all.</p><p></p><p>Could it be that they offered some kind of benefit? </p><p></p><p>But even that is unrealistic, as the damage caused by the He Clan refining the Millennium Calamity Body is far greater than any benefit they could offer.</p><p></p><p>"Nantian came to seek advice from the Elder and the Old Patriarch because this matter is of great importance. One wrong step and it will be a bottomless abyss. Nantian dares not decide alone, so he came to ask the Elder and the Old Patriarch to make the decision!" Ye Nantian said humbly.</p><p></p><p>Ye Zhuiyue and Ye Zhuixing fell silent for a moment, then suddenly looked at each other and spoke at the same time:</p><p></p><p>"Big brother (Zhuixing), what do you think?"</p><p></p><p>Ye Zhuixing pondered for a moment, then solemnly said, "Big brother, it seems that the He Clan refining the Millennium Calamity Body is now inevitable. They have the support of so many superior ancient clans, even the Ouyang Clan. We other ancient clans may not be able to stop them, our strength is not enough..."</p><p></p><p>Here is the full English translation of the Chinese excerpt:</p><p></p><p>He gently pursed his lips and sighed while looking up, "Yes, whether we support them or not is no longer important. I even estimate that if we don't support the He Clan, we will be held accountable afterwards."</p><p></p><p>Ye Nantian was taken aback and asked, "Does the Ancestor mean that our Ye Clan should also side with the He Clan?"</p><p></p><p>Ye Zhuiyue did not directly answer, but said in a serious tone:</p><p></p><p>"Whether we take a stance or not is not urgent right now. Let's first see the stance of the remaining Hong Clan. If even the Hong Clan supports the He Clan... then we can only go with the flow and let them refine the Myriad Worlds Calamity Body. At that time, it won't be strange for us to be selfish, after all, under a fallen nest... there are no intact eggs left, so we should prioritize self-preservation first."</p><p></p><p>"Mm, Big Brother's idea is the same as mine," Ye Zhuixing nodded.</p><p></p><p>The Void Ancient Realm is not their Ye Clan's Void Ancient Realm, and the Primal-Chaos Heavens are not their Ye Clan's Primal-Chaos Heavens!</p><p></p><p>Many times, doing the impossible is the true foolishness!</p><p></p><p>Life is the most important!</p><p></p><p>"Nantian understands the Ancestor's and the Elder's intentions," Ye Nantian said solemnly.</p><p></p><p>The three fell silent for a while, their expressions not looking very good.</p><p></p><p>Seeing this, Ye Nantian carefully changed the subject, "Ancestor, there is a banquet in the clan tonight. Will you attend?"</p><p></p><p>A banquet??? </p><p></p><p>Ye Zhuiyue looked at Ye Nantian with a puzzled expression, and then suddenly burst into a rage, pointing at him and scolding angrily, "You useless thing!! What time is it now, and you're still holding a banquet?! Get the hell out of here!!"</p><p></p><p>After saying that, he kicked out, startling Ye Nantian, who hurriedly covered his vital parts in advance!</p><p></p><p>Fortunately, Ye Zhuixing was quick-witted and hurriedly blocked for Ye Nantian, chuckling, "Big Brother, you've misunderstood Nantian."</p><p></p><p>"Hmph, what could I have misunderstood about him!" Ye Zhuiyue said coldly as he retracted his foot.</p><p></p><p>Ye Zhuixing shook his head and smiled, "Big Brother, you don't know this. Ye Ting's son, Xun Mang, has returned..."</p><p></p><p>"Oh? Xun Mang, that kid, has returned?" Ye Zhuiyue immediately interrupted.</p><p></p><p>"Big Brother, don't be hasty, that's not the key point. The important thing is the other person who came back with Xun Mang..." Ye Zhuixing said mysteriously.</p><p></p><p>"Zhuixing, are you also playing dumb with me?" Ye Zhuiyue said, clearly displeased.</p><p></p><p>"Hehe." Ye Zhuixing was not afraid of Ye Zhuiyue, and brushed off his sleeve and asked in return, "Big Brother, please don't be so impatient. Big Brother, do you think a expert who can slay a thousand Touching Demon Maidens with a single strike deserves for our Ye Clan to hold a banquet?"</p><p></p><p>Oh?!</p><p></p><p>Ye Zhuiyue's old eyes flickered, "The person you speak of...?"</p><p></p><p>"That's right." Ye Zhuixing nodded, "I've seen him in the Hidden Weapon Pavilion. I can feel that this Fellow Daoist Lu indeed has some skills."</p><p></p><p>Hearing this, Ye Zhuiyue was filled with anticipation, wanting to meet this person.</p><p></p><p>Ye Zhuiyue looked at Ye Nantian and patted his shoulder, smiling, "Nantian, you did well. A banquet should indeed be held. Did I scare you just now?"</p><p></p><p>"No, no." Ye Nantian forced a smile.</p><p></p><p>"Alright, I'll attend the banquet tonight. You all can leave first." Ye Zhuiyue waved his hand.</p><p></p><p>"Yes." Ye Nantian, who had been waiting for this moment for a long time, quickly turned and left.</p><p></p><p>Ye Zhuiyue had intended to close his eyes and continue cultivating, but noticed that Ye Zhuixing had not left yet, so he curiously asked, "Is there anything else?"</p><p></p><p>Ye Zhuixing's gaze was intense, "Big Brother, are you about to break through?"</p><p></p><p>Ye Zhuiyue was taken aback, then wryly smiled, "Your guess is half right, but the breakthrough... is still far away."</p>

        <h1>Chapter 326</h1>
        <div class="content">
            <p>Here is the full English translation of the excerpt from the Chinese novel:</p><p></p><p>Seeing the disciples who seemed somewhat at a loss, Lu Changsheng's mouth curved into a slight arc as he said:</p><p></p><p>"In this Linglang Heavens, the Carefree Sect is already the strongest. Without any rivals or sense of crisis, it is difficult to make further progress. Since I have built the Carefree Sect, as the Sect Master, I naturally have to consider you all."</p><p></p><p>"The path of cultivation seems to be endless. Are you seeking that elusive and ethereal longevity?"</p><p></p><p>"Or do you wish to stop at the Linglang Heavens, waiting for your realm to reach its limit, and then fade away in the vast river of time?"</p><p></p><p>Longevity.</p><p></p><p>The people on the martial field were momentarily dazed. The word "longevity" seemed to be an aspiration that was lofty and ethereal at any realm.</p><p></p><p>From the Refining Qi stage, they had heard of longevity. Some cultivators cultivated immortality to fly freely, while others cultivated to uphold justice and eliminate demons in the world.</p><p></p><p>But there was one thing that was the common dream of all cultivators - that was longevity.</p><p></p><p>But does true longevity really exist in the world?</p><p></p><p>Whether it was Li Shuoyan or the five Elder Peng, their eyes were filled with bewilderment at this moment.</p><p></p><p>All along, from the Refining Qi stage, through Foundation Establishment, Golden Core, Nascent Soul, and even reaching the current Divine Elemental and Divine Yang realms, their lifespans had only increased incrementally.</p><p></p><p>Longevity remained elusive and ethereal.</p><p></p><p>Beside them, the old turtle looked at the perplexed crowd, then stole a glance at Lu Changsheng on the high platform.</p><p></p><p>He did not feel that longevity was ethereal, after all, his master was an immortal. Yes, his name was fitting.</p><p></p><p>And as the mount of his master, he was the only immortal heavenly turtle in the world. However, he could not be compared to his master, whose eternal lifespan was truly immortal.</p><p></p><p>As for himself, he was only nearly immortal. Perhaps in the distant future, he too would fade away in the river of time.</p><p></p><p>Of course, he was also aware that as his opponents grew stronger, his own strength was no longer sufficient. That's why he had been cultivating frantically recently.</p><p></p><p>Otherwise, it would be a joke if the immortal heavenly turtle was killed by someone.</p><p></p><p>Although his life was extremely resilient and the chance of being killed was small, even if he was on the verge of death, he would slowly recover. But if the opponent was strong enough, they could still suppress and imprison him.</p><p></p><p>This was similar to how his master was suppressed and imprisoned in the immortal tomb by those mysterious figures thousands of years ago due to his insufficient strength at the time.</p><p></p><p>Speaking of this, the old turtle couldn't help but wonder, since his master had returned, had he resolved those mysterious figures?</p><p></p><p>...</p><p></p><p>"To the Sect Master! We do not wish to stop at the Linglang Heavens!" </p><p></p><p>Quickly, the people on the martial field shouted while bowing.</p><p></p><p>Especially the five Elder Peng, their faces were filled with excitement!</p><p></p><p>No one here understood the pain of reaching the limit of their realm better than these five.</p><p></p><p>Lu Changsheng nodded slightly and said, "The path ahead is long and arduous. That is a world full of wonders and perils, where myriad tribes contend."</p><p></p><p>Myriad tribes contend!</p><p></p><p>What a grand and magnificent world that must be!</p><p></p><p>The expressions of the crowd were greatly shaken!</p><p></p><p>Ever since the Carefree Sect had dominated the Linglang Heavens, their spirits had been lacking. But in that moment, it had returned.</p><p></p><p>And in their understanding, there were only a few simple categories of tribes, such as humans, demonic beasts, and evil monsters.</p><p></p><p>But myriad tribes? It was simply unimaginable.</p><p></p><p>"As for the specifics, I'm not entirely sure either. We'll know once we get there," Lu Changsheng said.</p><p></p><p>Elder Peng hesitated slightly, then gathered the courage to ask the question on everyone's mind:</p><p></p><p>"Sect Master, when will we go, and how will we go? What about the sect?"</p><p></p><p>After Peng said this, the crowd looked around the Carefree Sect's premises, their eyes filled with reluctance. After all, this was their sect's headquarters.</p><p></p><p>"That's simple. I will move the entire sect. For the time being, you can stay in the sect and do as you please. When we arrive at the destination, I will..."</p><p></p><p>Here is the full English translation of the Chinese excerpt:</p><p></p><p>"I will let you all out," Luchang Sheng said with a faint smile.</p><p></p><p>This is just to give you a heads-up in advance, so that this group of people won't panic and won't know what's happening.</p><p></p><p>Hiss!</p><p></p><p>The crowd drew a sharp breath, directly moving the entire sect? This is an extraordinary method.</p><p></p><p>Even though Peng Fang and the others had followed from the Heavenly Scar all the way to Linglang Heavens, at this moment they were still shocked.</p><p></p><p>Although they had witnessed the sect master move the Jiang clan's imperial family to Qingxuan Town during the Heavenly Scar, this time it was different - it was a cross-world relocation, and the sect master said the journey was extremely long.</p><p></p><p>"Peng Fang, during this time, you five elders should cultivate well. The moment you step out of Linglang Heavens, the constraints on your realms will disappear," Luchang Sheng said, looking at Peng Fang and the others.</p><p></p><p>"Yes!" The five elders responded joyfully, coming to their senses.</p><p></p><p>Luchang Sheng nodded slightly, his figure moving, and he appeared in the air above the Carefree Sect. He looked at the entire Carefree Sect and said faintly, "Next, I will use a method to bring the Carefree Sect into a small world, so don't be alarmed."</p><p></p><p>"Yes!" The people on the training ground looked up at the azure figure in the sky, their eyes filled with anticipation.</p><p></p><p>Just as Luchang Sheng was about to make a move, Old Turtle and Li Shuyan simultaneously flashed to the sky, coming behind him. Old Turtle chuckled awkwardly, "Hehe, Master, Old Turtle will stay in the outside world."</p><p></p><p>"Me too," Li Shuyan said, rubbing his bald head.</p><p></p><p>Below, people like Tongxin Lin Dong were quite envious, but they had no choice - they were still too weak, so they could only cultivate diligently within the sect.</p><p></p><p>Luchang Sheng sighed, then waved his sleeve towards the Carefree Sect below!</p><p></p><p>"Rumble..."</p><p></p><p>Suddenly, the people on the training ground felt the ground shaking, no, it was the entire Carefree Sect that was shaking. Many demonic beasts and birds in the mountains and forests were fleeing in terror!</p><p></p><p>But before the various demonic beasts and birds could escape the Carefree Sect,</p><p></p><p>the entire Carefree Sect disappeared!</p><p></p><p>It was as if it had been forcibly erased, leaving not a single trace.</p><p></p><p>"Uh." Li Shuyan was dumbfounded, he didn't even have time to react before the Carefree Sect vanished, not knowing how the master had done it.</p><p></p><p>At the same time,</p><p></p><p>"Ahhhhhâ€”"</p><p></p><p>The Carefree Sect sank into a vast darkness, the entire sect rotating 360 degrees, with countless disciples' cries of panic echoing.</p><p></p><p>Su Qianghe's face was tense, as he tightly hugged Peng Fang, shouting at the disciples, "It's nothing, don't panic!!"</p><p></p><p>Peng Fang was resigned.</p><p></p><p>When a ray of light shone, the sect finally stopped, and everyone heaved a sigh of relief.</p><p></p><p>Peng Fang shook off Su Qianghe and rose into the air, his eyes widening as he looked at the Carefree Sect. At this moment, the Carefree Sect was floating in the void, with endless emptiness all around.</p><p></p><p>Soon, his expression changed, and a look of joy appeared, not just on him, but also on Su Qianghe and the others.</p><p></p><p>Their realms had actually loosened, could it be that they had already left Linglang Heavens?</p><p></p><p>"All of you, do not make a sound, and go cultivate properly!" Peng Fang shouted, rushing to close his eyes and enter seclusion.</p><p></p><p>...</p><p></p><p>In the boundless void,</p><p></p><p>A flying chariot streaked across like a shooting star.</p><p></p><p>Old Turtle and Li Shuyan sat on the deck of the flying chariot, pointing and discussing the route map in their hands.</p><p></p><p>Soon, Old Turtle slapped Li Shuyan on the head, saying, "Hey, Li Shuyan, you got the direction wrong, didn't you? The Divine-Demonic Battlefield is in the other direction!"</p><p></p><p>Li Shuyan rubbed his head, feeling a bit speechless and also somewhat frustrated. Even though he had reached the Divine Yang realm by following the master, he was still no match for Old Turtle.</p><p></p><p>It was amazing how Old Turtle had become so powerful in such a short time in Linglang Heavens, far surpassing Li Shuyan. But when he remembered Old Turtle's identity, he felt at ease - of course, someone qualified to be the master's mount would be extraordinary.</p>

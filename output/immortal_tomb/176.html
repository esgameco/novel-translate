        <h1>Chapter 176</h1>
        <div class="content">
            <p>Here is my translation of the Chinese excerpt you provided:</p><p></p><p>Outside of Qingxuan Town, it was completely silent. ‚àô‚àô¬∑‚ñ´‚ñ´·µí·¥º·µí‚ñ´‚Çí‚Çí‚ñ´·µí·¥º·µí‚ñ´‚Çí‚Çí‚ñ´·µí·¥º·µí 6‚ûàs‚ìóùïåùêó.ùêú√òÔº≠ ·µí·¥º·µí‚ñ´‚Çí‚Çí‚ñ´·µí·¥º·µí‚ñ´‚Çí‚Çí‚ñ´·µí·¥º·µí‚ñ´‚ñ´¬∑‚àô‚àô</p><p></p><p>Listening to the conversation between Jiang Wumang and Lu Changsheng,</p><p></p><p>The faces of Jiang Wuji and the others finally changed, turning deathly pale.</p><p></p><p>Their ancestor... was actually begging for mercy.</p><p></p><p>It must be known that the ancestor was a powerful cultivator at the Saint Ancestor Realm. Although his lifespan was running out, he was still at the Saint Ancestor Realm, at the pinnacle of the cultivation world.</p><p></p><p>Jiang Wumang paused, turning to look at Jiang Wuji and the others of the Jiang Clan Imperial Family, an apologetic look in his eyes. The calamity he had brought about had implicated the entire Jiang Clan Imperial Family...</p><p></p><p>He knew that the current Lu Changsheng was extremely powerful, to a degree that he could not comprehend, as evidenced by the fact that he had forcefully relocated the entire Jiang Clan Imperial Family from the Sacred Immortal Realm to the Black Calamity Realm.</p><p></p><p>Jiang Wumang asked himself, he would not have been able to accomplish this, even at the peak of his powers.</p><p></p><p>Today... the Jiang Clan Imperial Family might not survive.</p><p></p><p>"Wuji, lead the clan disciples to prepare for a desperate battle," </p><p></p><p>Jiang Wumang closed his eyes and said.</p><p></p><p>Since Lu Changsheng was determined, any self-reproaching words he could say to Jiang Wuji and the others would be meaningless.</p><p></p><p>"Yes, ancestor."</p><p></p><p>Jiang Wuji and the elders bowed and accepted the order, a defeated look in their eyes.</p><p></p><p>Just yesterday, the Jiang Clan Imperial Family was at the height of its prosperity, and today they faced life and death...</p><p></p><p>On the other side, Xing Tian glanced at Lu Changsheng's back, originally intending to request to join the battle, but then thought better of it. This was Lu Changsheng's personal vendetta, so it would be more appropriate for him to resolve it himself.</p><p></p><p>Seeing this, the countless cultivators in the sky trembled, their hearts burning with passion, all rushing towards the rear of Qingxuan Town, instinctively ceding the battlefield to Lu Changsheng and the Jiang Clan Imperial Family.</p><p></p><p>"Lu Changsheng, this old man knows that the Jiang Clan Imperial Family has reached its end today, but even in ruin, the Jiang Clan will stand tall!"</p><p></p><p>Jiang Wumang's fierce roar echoed through the heavens and earth.</p><p></p><p>His originally lifeless face suddenly flushed red, as if experiencing a final burst of vitality.</p><p></p><p>Whoosh, whoosh, whoosh...!</p><p></p><p>As his words fell, countless streams of light surged up into the sky from the Jiang Clan's domain, standing in a vast and majestic formation behind Jiang Wuji and the elders.</p><p></p><p>They were all disciples of the Jiang Clan Imperial Family, and as far as the eye could see, they were as numerous as ants covering the sky, dense and endless!</p><p></p><p>They already knew the situation, and their eyes shone with an unyielding battle intent.</p><p></p><p>This battle intent was as tangible as a physical force, blanketing the heavens.</p><p></p><p>This sight caused all the cultivators' hearts to race.</p><p></p><p>They imagined, if they were the ones facing the Jiang Clan Imperial Family... how long could they last?</p><p></p><p>Truly, the Imperial Clan was not something the scattered cultivators could contend with.</p><p></p><p>At the same time,</p><p></p><p>Left Qiu Shan's gaze was drawn to one of the two young men standing behind the elders!</p><p></p><p>To be able to stand in that position meant that this young man was a direct heir of the Jiang Clan Imperial Family!</p><p></p><p>"He... he...."</p><p></p><p>Left Qiu Shan stared intently at the young man, his gaze trembling. He could sense a familiar, intimate feeling from this young man.</p><p></p><p>This had to be his son!</p><p></p><p>"Father, what's wrong?" Left Qi Ran immediately noticed Left Qiu Shan's unusual behavior and turned to look in the direction he was gazing.</p><p></p><p>Left Qiu Shan did not answer her, his eyes frantically shifting between the young man in the sky and Lu Changsheng. </p><p></p><p>Blood was even seeping from the corners of his mouth.</p><p></p><p>Left Qi Ran was puzzled, following his line of sight to the Jiang Clan Imperial Family, where she saw the young man.</p><p></p><p>As the saying goes, a father and son share a deep bond.</p><p></p><p>Here is the full English translation of the Chinese excerpt:</p><p></p><p>In the sky, Jiang Zhou's heart suddenly jumped, and following that scorching gaze, he saw a middle-aged man in Qingxuan Town staring fixedly at him...</p><p></p><p>"Eh?"</p><p></p><p>Jiang Zhou hastily covered his chest, not knowing why, but his heart felt a slight twinge of pain.</p><p></p><p>"Young Master, what's wrong with you?" </p><p></p><p>A nearby elder frowned and asked.</p><p></p><p>Jiang Zhou took a deep breath, shook his head silently, and withdrew his gaze.</p><p></p><p>...</p><p></p><p>"Boy, could that not be the son that the Jiang Imperial Clan took from you?" </p><p></p><p>At this time, the sharp-minded Peng Fang looked at Left Qiu Shan and asked.</p><p></p><p>After all, he had just talked to him about the grievances between this young man and the Jiang Imperial Clan.</p><p></p><p>Left Qiu Shan's body trembled, he wiped the blood from the corner of his mouth and bitterly smiled, "The senior is right..."</p><p></p><p>Peng Fang furrowed his brows and sighed, "This is troublesome... Your son, if nothing unexpected happens, will perish at the hands of the shopkeeper today."</p><p></p><p>Left Qiu Shan lowered his head without a word, his body trembling even more.</p><p></p><p>Hearing this, Left Qi Ran beside him was also dumbfounded, not expecting that the young man was actually her brother whom she had never met?</p><p></p><p>Although they had no emotional connection, upon hearing that her brother was about to die, she also had an indescribable feeling.</p><p></p><p>Peng Fang sighed and fell silent, he also didn't know what to say.</p><p></p><p>Although that young man was Left Qiu Shan's son, he had been raised in the Jiang Imperial Clan since he was young...</p><p></p><p>There were too many unexplainable things in between, sigh.</p><p></p><p>...</p><p></p><p>"From the day you became my enemy... today is already destined; those who oppose me, those who disrupt my rules, I, Lu Changsheng, have always... slain them all."</p><p></p><p>Lu Changsheng looked at the solemn-faced Jiang Wumao and said indifferently, and then an ancient longsword materialized in his hand...</p><p></p><p>The next moment, a sword strike was unleashed.</p><p></p><p>"Clang‚Äî"</p><p></p><p>The crisp and piercing sword cry suddenly erupted in the heaven and earth, as if the entire Black Sha Domain and even the Heavenly Trace could hear it!</p><p></p><p>The surging azure sword qi burst forth from the sword tip like a starry river!</p><p></p><p>Illuminating the ten directions of the world!</p><p></p><p>Everyone's eardrums burst, staring dumbfounded at that terrifying sword qi, at that cold-blooded killing intent, at that figure in blue holding the sword, they felt as if they had fallen into an icy cellar!</p><p></p><p>Jiang Wumao's gaze changed drastically, Lu Changsheng was really too strong... He then roared, "Gather the entire clan's power to block this sword qi!!"</p><p></p><p>This terrifying and peerless sword qi was not something they could directly confront head-on, the only chance was to block it.</p><p></p><p>As soon as the words fell, Jiang Wuji and all the scions of the Jiang Imperial Clan snapped out of their panic and recklessly released the immortal elements within them, trying to block this sword qi!</p><p></p><p>But at this moment!</p><p></p><p>The speed of the sword qi suddenly increased sharply, and in the blink of an eye, it had arrived!</p><p></p><p>"Wuji, don't stop, keep going! I'll help you block for a moment!"</p><p></p><p>Jiang Wumao had just finished speaking when</p><p></p><p>Jiang Wuji threw a black giant sword over: "Ancestor, use the clan treasure!!"</p><p></p><p>Jiang Wumao caught it with one hand, then suddenly turned around, and with his white hair flying, he swung the sword!</p><p></p><p>Instantly, black sword beams filled the sky, dyeing the sky as black as ink!</p><p></p><p>But...</p><p></p><p>The terrifying azure sword qi was like a ray of light in the darkness, and in the dumbfounded gaze of everyone, it shattered the vast black darkness in an instant!</p><p></p><p>At the same time, the black giant sword in Jiang Wumao's hand also suddenly shattered into pieces!</p><p></p><p>Immediately afterwards, the azure sword qi swiftly passed by Jiang Wumao...</p><p></p><p>Time and space seemed to slow down countless times in that instant...</p>

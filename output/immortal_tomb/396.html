        <h1>Chapter 396</h1>
        <div class="content">
            <p>Here is the full English translation of the Chinese excerpt:</p><p></p><p>Time passed, and a month had gone by in the blink of an eye.</p><p></p><p>All the tribes had come to the Divine Clan.</p><p></p><p>At this time, the Divine Plaza was already overcrowded!</p><p></p><p>Even though the Divine Plaza was vast, it was still difficult to accommodate so many people from all the tribes.</p><p></p><p>As a result, countless cultivators from different tribes were crowded outside the Divine Plaza, and it was even very crowded outside the plaza.</p><p></p><p>At this moment, there was complete silence, and no one dared to make a sound.</p><p></p><p>All the races were looking up at the huge stone pillar in the center, trembling with fear.</p><p></p><p>On top of the pillar, the clan leaders of the major clans, such as Bi You and Ao Zhen Tian, were bound and hanging there... They were covered in fresh blood and looked utterly dejected.</p><p></p><p>There were even a few clan leaders who were currently unconscious.</p><p></p><p>Although they had already learned in advance that these peak clan leaders had been dealt with by the Divine Lord, seeing it with their own eyes was a different kind of terror.</p><p></p><p>All the tribes were as silent as cicadas in winter!</p><p></p><p>Naturally, countless gazes converged on the peak major clans, such as the Devouring Beast Clan, the Dragon Clan, and the Fire Phoenix Clan.</p><p></p><p>Sure enough, the holy scions and elders of these major clans were all furious!!</p><p></p><p>"Father..." </p><p></p><p>Ao Xing stared fixedly at Ao Zhen Tian on the stone pillar, his anger almost making him lose his mind!</p><p></p><p>If it weren't for the elder next to him forcefully pulling Ao Xing back, Ao Xing might have rushed up there!</p><p></p><p>"Holy scion... The clan leader's transmission told us not to act rashly," the Dragon Clan's great elder said bitterly as he held back Ao Xing.</p><p></p><p>Ao Xing trembled and regained a bit of sanity, saying with difficulty, "Great elder, what about my father? The Divine Clan has summoned all the tribes to attend this divine assembly, and they must be trying to assert their authority over the clan leaders."</p><p></p><p>Hearing this, the great elder slowly shook his head and said, "Asserting authority is one thing, but the Divine Lord shouldn't really go all-out against the clan leaders, after all, they are all among the top ten peak clan leaders. The Divine Lord would need to pass the Heavenly Dao's test to truly go against them."</p><p></p><p>Ao Xing's heart stirred, and he looked up at the dazzling Tribal Ranking list, feeling slightly relieved.</p><p></p><p>"There's no help for it. The Divine Lord has already attained the divine realm, and from now on, the tribes in the Divine-Demonic Battlefield will be at his mercy. Who can withstand his might?" the great elder said dejectedly, then continued, "Holy scion, while the Divine Lord may not go all-out against the clan leaders, the Human Tribe... I'm afraid they're doomed."</p><p></p><p>The Human Tribe had killed the third Divine Official and kidnapped the Divine Child, offending the Divine Clan to the utmost.</p><p></p><p>This could be considered an unparalleled grudge!</p><p></p><p>Even if the Heavenly Dao, for some reason, had been giving the Human Tribe extra protection, the Divine Clan had a legitimate reason to annihilate the Human Tribe, and the Heavenly Dao couldn't do anything about it.</p><p></p><p>Moreover, the current Divine Lord was the first Divine Realm cultivator in the history of the Divine-Demonic Battlefield.</p><p></p><p>No one knew exactly how powerful he was, but judging from the miserable state of Bi You and the others, one could get a glimpse of it.</p><p></p><p>Ao Xing sighed and looked around, but he didn't see the Human Tribe, so it seemed they hadn't arrived yet.</p><p></p><p>Well, it's not like the Human Tribe needed to come so early, they would only be the target of everyone's attention.</p><p></p><p>And if the Human Tribe were present, they would undoubtedly be the focus of everyone's gaze.</p><p></p><p>"Great elder, do you think the Human Tribe can weather this calamity? After all, that Azure-robed one..." Ao Xing said softly.</p><p></p><p>The great elder's eyes flickered as he said, "Lu Nan of the Human Tribe is extremely powerful, his cultivation reaching the late or even peak Divine Warrior Realm..."</p><p></p><p>Pausing, the great elder shook his head and continued, "Lu Nan's strength may even have glimpsed the threshold of the Divine Realm, but even so, it's only a glimpse. Compared to the genuine Divine Realm experts like the Divine Lord... I'm afraid he won't even be able to withstand a single attack, just like the clan leaders."</p><p></p><p>Ao Xing's gaze grew grave.</p><p></p><p>Here is the full English translation of the Chinese excerpt:</p><p></p><p>At this so-called Divine Ceremony, the human race would likely not fare well...</p><p></p><p>"Alas, Holy Son, let's not talk about the human race. In the current situation, even we great clans are struggling to protect ourselves!" sighed the Elder.</p><p></p><p>Ao Xing nodded, then deeply inhaled and slowly closed his eyes, not wanting to look at the suspended Ao Zhengtian, fearing he would lose control of himself.</p><p></p><p>At the same time, the great clans such as the Devouring Beast Clan and the Fire Phoenix Clan also revealed their anger, but dared not act rashly!</p><p></p><p>This move by the Celestial Clan had essentially thrown their peak great clan's face to the ground and trampled on it!</p><p></p><p>But in the face of absolute power, the only thing they could do was to endure it.</p><p></p><p>"Eh, the human race hasn't arrived yet?"</p><p></p><p>"Ah, they should be arriving soon. The human race dares not not come."</p><p></p><p>"Honestly, the human race has also been unlucky. With the emergence of the Azure Robe Sword Immortal, a peerless figure, the human race was about to rise. Who would have thought the Celestial Lord would suddenly break through to the Divine Realm..."</p><p></p><p>"Yes, the human race had the Azure Robe Sword Immortal and other such figures, yet they have hidden them until now. It seems they have great ambitions, but their luck has just been a bit poor."</p><p></p><p>"Hehe, you all are actually starting to feel sympathy for the human race? Don't forget, just recently, the experts from all the tribes went to the human race, and that Azure Robe Sword Immortal slaughtered them all! You can't tell me none of your clansmen were among them."</p><p></p><p>"......"</p><p></p><p>Although the various tribes dared not openly speak, the private transmissions of their discussions were extremely dense!</p><p></p><p>Whoosh whoosh whoosh!</p><p></p><p>Just as the various tribes were discussing in secret, figures began appearing one after another at the base of the high platform - they were all members of the Celestial Clan, and they all had magnificent wings.</p><p></p><p>And those who appeared in this location were all high-ranking members of the Celestial Clan!</p><p></p><p>Leading them were the two Divine Officials, Divine Moon and Divine Star.</p><p></p><p>Divine Moon's gaze quickly swept over the various tribes, but after not finding the human race, her brow furrowed slightly, imperceptibly, and she then shouted:</p><p></p><p>"All tribes, kneel and welcome the Celestial Lord!"</p><p></p><p>As soon as the words fell, whether in the Celestial Plaza or outside of it, all the tribes trembled and prostrated themselves, wave after wave, like surging tidal waves, grand and majestic.</p><p></p><p>Even peak great clans like Ao Xing gritted their teeth and knelt down, unwilling.</p><p></p><p>In the past, the Celestial Lord did not have such a grand presence!</p><p></p><p>But now... there was no choice, in this world where strength is supreme... Damn it!</p><p></p><p>"We kneel and welcome the Celestial Lord!!!" </p><p></p><p>The tribes shouted in unison, the terrifying sound waves seemingly able to pierce the heavens.</p><p></p><p>Divine Moon, Divine Star, and the other Celestial Clan members also turned and knelt down on the high platform, their hearts filled with the utmost excitement!</p><p></p><p>The tribes' prostration, this was the supreme majesty that belonged to their Celestial Clan. As members of the Celestial Clan, they took pride in this.</p><p></p><p>On the stone pillar, the originally unconscious clan leaders were also awakened by the commotion. Just like Bi You and Ao Zhengtian, they bitterly watched this scene.</p><p></p><p>They ultimately failed to stop the advance of the Celestial Thunderclap...</p><p></p><p>The next moment,</p><p></p><p>A flash of white light appeared on the high platform, and Celestial Thunderclap, with his magnificent white wings, hovered above the platform.</p><p></p><p>Celestial Thunderclap looked at the countless foreign tribes around him, his gaze filled with unrestrained delight.</p><p></p><p>This was the era that belonged to him, Celestial Thunderclap!</p><p></p><p>But soon, the smile in Celestial Thunderclap's eyes faded, and he asked indifferently:</p><p></p><p>"Where is the human race?"</p><p></p><p>...</p><p></p><p>For the fastest updates on this flawless novel, please visit www.feixs.com</p><p></p><p>For mobile access, please go to https://m.feixs.com/chapter-45751-38225515</p>

        <h1>Chapter 147</h1>
        <div class="content">
            <p>Here is the full English translation of the Chinese excerpt:</p><p></p><p>The Black Abyss Domain, although called a domain, is much smaller in area compared to other major domains, with only dozens of large cities and over a hundred small towns. These towns in the Black Abyss Domain are quite distant from each other, each forming its own power.</p><p></p><p>The reason the Black Abyss Domain can be called a domain is mainly due to its unique ability to accommodate all kinds of people - there are hidden dragons and crouching tigers.</p><p></p><p>The Qingxuan Town is located on the eastern edge of the Black Abyss Domain. Among the hundreds of small towns in the domain, it is relatively obscure and unremarkable.</p><p></p><p>The entire town is inhabited solely by cultivators, without a single ordinary person. In fact, the entire Black Abyss Domain does not have a single ordinary person! This kind of vicious and evil place is simply not suitable for ordinary people to live in. Perhaps there were some in the past, but they were all killed off, and over time, no one dared to live there.</p><p></p><p>Qingxuan Town is very large, but the total number of cultivators residing there is probably less than 200,000. Every corner of the town is constantly filled with battles, laughter, curses, and all kinds of astonishing events.</p><p></p><p>Today, Qingxuan Town is especially lively! Because a new person has arrived in the town.</p><p></p><p>Normally, the arrival of a new person in Qingxuan Town is not a big deal. The Black Abyss Domain is a place with a high flow of cultivators, and everyone is usually too busy to pay attention.</p><p></p><p>It's not even because the new person opened a tavern. Opening a tavern is not a big deal either.</p><p></p><p>The main reason that has caught their attention is that the tavern owner is extremely arrogant! The tavern is actually named "Longevity Tavern"!</p><p></p><p>Goodness, who in this world dares to claim longevity? These cultivators are all ruthless characters who don't submit to anyone, unless the other party has the strength to back it up. In this world of the survival of the fittest, might is right.</p><p></p><p>If the tavern owner has some strength, it would be fine. But if he doesn't, they won't be so accommodating - they might just destroy the tavern, tear down the signboard, or even directly eliminate him! Arrogance must be paid for!</p><p></p><p>However, there are also many people whose eyes are gleaming, eager to watch the excitement. While there are some simple-minded and brute-force types, they are only a small minority.</p><p></p><p>To dare to open a tavern in the Black Abyss Domain, and even name it "Longevity Tavern", the tavern owner must either be tired of living or have some extraordinary abilities...</p><p></p><p>"Let's go, let's go, the Longevity Tavern is opening today, and apparently many people have gone to take a look. There must be some who are unhappy and will go to test the waters."</p><p></p><p>"Hehe, I can't wait to see that arrogant tavern owner get slaughtered."</p><p></p><p>"Hey, Fourth Brother, look at how you're talking. Someone who dares to open a tavern in the Black Abyss Domain must have some strength, right?"</p><p></p><p>"Hehe, in this Heavenly Scar, there are plenty of people who think highly of themselves. He may have some strength, but probably not much."</p><p></p><p>...</p><p></p><p>Many cultivators, laughing and mocking, rushed towards a certain area of the town.</p><p></p><p>Even the street vendors and shop owners along the way hurriedly closed their businesses and joined the crowd, deciding that making money today was not as interesting as watching the show.</p><p></p><p>Meanwhile, in a luxurious mansion in the town, a clear, bell-like laughter rang out.</p><p></p><p>"Longevity Tavern? Interesting. You just said that the tavern is opening today?"</p><p></p><p>A young girl, with long white hair and delicate fairy-like features, asked with amusement, while playing with a sinister purple snake in her hands.</p><p></p><p>Here is the full English translation of the Chinese excerpt:</p><p></p><p>The venomous snake coiled around her slender arm, its head raised high, its forked tongue flicking in and out.</p><p></p><p>"Miss..." the maidservant bowed, not finishing her sentence.</p><p></p><p>But Zuo Qi Ran suddenly lost her smile, coldly saying, "How many times have I told you to address me as Young Master!"</p><p></p><p>The maidservant's face turned deathly pale in fright, and she quickly knelt down, trembling as she said, "Young Master, please forgive this servant's slip of the tongue. This servant deserves to die!"</p><p></p><p>"Hmm, you do deserve to die. How many times has this happened now?" Zuo Qi Ran said.</p><p></p><p>Without waiting for the terrified maidservant to respond, she continued, "This is the second time. But if there is a third time, then let Little Purple eat you."</p><p></p><p>As she spoke, the purple snake in her hand seemed to be staring intently at the maidservant.</p><p></p><p>The maidservant was trembling in fear as she replied, "Yes..."</p><p></p><p>"You may rise," Zuo Qi Ran said, her face once again bearing a smile.</p><p></p><p>The maidservant was cautious, for she had served Zuo Qi Ran for a long time and knew her mercurial temperament. She rose and bowed, then continued the previous topic:</p><p></p><p>"Young Master, I've heard that the new tavern is opening today, and many people have gone to take a look."</p><p></p><p>Zuo Qi Ran nodded, then after a moment's consideration, smiled and said, "Let's go take a look. This Young Master wants to see what skills the tavern owner has, to dare name his tavern 'Longevity'."</p><p></p><p>The maidservant was alarmed, quickly saying, "Young Master, you needn't go personally for such a trivial matter... Now, the world is abuzz with scattered cultivators, and the powers in this town either don't care or are observing from the sidelines. No one has come forward yet, because... because if the tavern's name doesn't match its substance, the power that steps forward will lose face. And then the Lord..."</p><p></p><p>The maidservant was a bit anxious, as the Young Miss represented the Heavenly Snake Manor when she went out.</p><p></p><p>Zuo Qi Ran paused, then tilted her head and said indifferently, "Are you trying to teach me how to do things?"</p><p></p><p>The maidservant trembled, lowering her head.</p><p></p><p>"Do you think this Young Master would just go like that?" Zuo Qi Ran said.</p><p></p><p>As she spoke, she began murmuring something, and suddenly her white hair turned black, her appearance transforming into that of a handsome young man. She then placed the purple snake in her bosom, swiftly changed her clothes, and with a flick of her hand, a paper fan appeared.</p><p></p><p>In an instant, the chilling snake-keeping young lady had become a carefree young master.</p><p></p><p>However, his physique still appeared somewhat delicate.</p><p></p><p>The maidservant visibly relaxed a bit, but then worried, "Young Master, in this Black Calamity Domain of Qingxuan Town, with your scholarly appearance, there may be some ruffians who will try to cause trouble. If that happens..."</p><p></p><p>"Too nosy!" Zuo Qi Ran suddenly slapped the maidservant, sending her flying and crashing to the ground. The maidservant covered her reddened face, her eyes brimming with tears.</p><p></p><p>"After all this time, do you think I don't know that you are the one the Lord has placed to monitor me? I'm not killing you only because I'm giving him some face. But if you truly anger this Young Master, even if I kill you, he can only be more displeased with me."</p><p></p><p>Zuo Qi Ran's handsome face was expressionless as she spoke in an indifferent tone.</p><p></p><p>Without sparing a glance at the trembling maidservant kneeling on the ground, she opened her paper fan and walked out.</p><p></p><p>The maidservant shakily got up, her forehead drenched in sweat, feeling as if she had just escaped the gates of hell. But remembering the Lord's instructions, she gritted her teeth and carefully followed behind, daring not to speak again.</p><p></p><p>Caught between the Lord and the Young Miss, she could not judge which was more terrifying. But compared to the Young Miss, the infamously cruel Lord was far more frightening...</p>

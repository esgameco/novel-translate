        <h1>Chapter 214</h1>
        <div class="content">
            <p>Here is the full English translation of the Chinese excerpt:</p><p></p><p>"Haha, good!" </p><p></p><p>Peng Fang nodded in satisfaction. üëäüòÇ‚ùª‚ùæ·îïùì±ùì§x.‚ìí‡πèùïÑ‚òπüç≠</p><p></p><p>He then looked at the flushed faces of the disciples and chuckled lightly: "The reason I've gathered you all today is just this. As for the rest..."</p><p></p><p>"I hope that in tomorrow's battle that surpasses your level, you will all unleash yourselves completely! Be as arrogant as you can, as wild as you can, as ruthless as you can!!"</p><p></p><p>"In this battle, our Xiaoyao Sect must step on the Great Thunder Sect and rise to the throne of the number one sect in the Human Realm!!"</p><p></p><p>Peng Fang's tone became more and more excited, more and more urgent, and more and more resolute with each sentence.</p><p></p><p>Even he couldn't help but get excited.</p><p></p><p>After all, the opponent this time is the Great Thunder Sect!</p><p></p><p>He had been here in the Linglang Heavens for some time, and he knew that the Great Thunder Sect, as a first-rate sect, was even stronger than the imperial clan of the Heavenly Scar!</p><p></p><p>The crowd was deeply infected, raising their arms and shouting,</p><p></p><p>"Ascend to the throne of the number one sect in the Human Realm! Ascend to the throne of the number one sect in the Human Realm!"</p><p></p><p>Seeing the morale soar, Peng Fang laughed heartily, then suddenly raised his hand and clenched his fist!</p><p></p><p>The voices immediately quieted down.</p><p></p><p>"Everyone go and rest well, and no one is allowed to cultivate tonight," Peng Fang said, continuing, "Tomorrow you must perform well. I believe the Sect Master will see it."</p><p></p><p>The crowd trembled inwardly and responded with a shout: "Yes!!"</p><p></p><p>.........</p><p></p><p>&lt;tt_keyword_ad data-title="Educational Training" data-tag="Recommended Products" data-type="1" data-value="1910"&gt;&lt;/tt_keyword_ad&gt;</p><p></p><p>The night passed without a word.</p><p></p><p>When the proud sun rose the next day,</p><p></p><p>A hoary and indifferent voice suddenly resounded across the skies of the Human Realm.</p><p></p><p>"The nine-ranked Xiaoyao Sect will battle the first-ranked Great Thunder Sect... The battlefield: the Sunset Thunder Forest!"</p><p></p><p>"The battle that surpasses your level begins today!"</p><p></p><p>Instantly, the Human Realm shook!</p><p></p><p>Countless gazes looked towards the Thunder Continent, even though many could not go there, it did not hinder their strong curiosity to watch the excitement.</p><p></p><p>A nine-ranked sect battling a first-ranked sect, unprecedented in history, and unlikely to ever happen again!</p><p></p><p>The Thunder Continent.</p><p></p><p>The moment the hoary voice fell, the Thunder Continent was like boiling water in an instant!</p><p></p><p>"The battle that surpasses the level has begun! Hurry, hurry, hurry to the Sunset Thunder Forest!!"</p><p></p><p>"It's actually in the Sunset Thunder Forest, isn't that too unfair for the Xiaoyao Sect? They are the weaker side! The battlefield is even more advantageous for the Great Thunder Sect?"</p><p></p><p>"Tsk, who told the Xiaoyao Sect to be the ones surpassing the level? In the past battles that surpassed the level, the battlefield was always in the territory of the sect being challenged, what can be done about it?"</p><p></p><p>"Yes, the Xiaoyao Sect can't challenge the Great Thunder Sect and then let them choose the battlefield, right?"</p><p></p><p>"Choosing the Sunset Thunder Forest, isn't the Great Thunder Sect shameless?"</p><p></p><p>"You don't understand, this wasn't chosen by the Great Thunder Sect, but was randomly determined."</p><p></p><p>"......"</p><p></p><p>Amid the discussions of the surging crowd, they rushed frantically towards the east of the Thunder Continent, the Sunset Thunder Forest!!</p><p></p><p>At this moment, it seemed as if the entire space of the Thunder Continent was faintly vibrating, because the number of people rushing was simply too large!</p><p></p><p>......</p><p></p><p>The Great Thunder Sect.</p><p></p><p>"Hehe, Thunder Sect Master, since the battlefield is in the Sunset Thunder Forest, then our sect and Elder Li will go over first," L√º Ye said with a smile.</p><p></p><p>"Good." Lei Chengdong cupped his hands.</p><p></p><p>L√º Ye and Li Tailing also returned the gesture, and the senior members and some other second-ranked sect forces behind them all bowed.</p><p></p><p>The next moment, these figures suddenly disappeared from this place!</p><p></p><p>Clearly, they had gone in the direction of the Sunset Thunder Forest.</p><p></p><p>Only then did Lei Chengdong turn around,</p><p></p><p>His gaze quickly swept over Lei Yu, Lei Ting, the elders, the servants, and the disciples.</p><p></p><p>He was preparing to lead the top combat forces of the sect.</p><p></p><p>Here is the full English translation of the Chinese excerpt:</p><p></p><p>"Mobilize, all together, about 20,000 or more.</p><p></p><p>Even after deducting countless servants and weaker outer sect disciples, the number is still more than the Xiaoyao Sect.</p><p></p><p>"For this battle, victory is the only option," said Leizheng Dong as he looked at the crowd.</p><p></p><p>"Victory!!!" the crowd responded with a shout.</p><p></p><p>"Wu Yan, lead the team and head to the Sunset Thunder Forest. Our sect will follow shortly," Leizheng Dong said calmly.</p><p></p><p>"Yes, Sect Master," Zhong Wuyan replied with a bow.</p><p></p><p>As the Great Elder of the Great Sun Thunder Sect, he was indeed one of the most respected figures.</p><p></p><p>Even Leiyu held him in high regard.</p><p></p><p>"Go!"</p><p></p><p>Zhong Wuyan gave the order.</p><p></p><p>"Yes!"</p><p></p><p>.........</p><p></p><p>Rumble‚Äî!</p><p></p><p>Waves of golden red lightning bolts struck the vast purple forest, accompanied by strong winds that caused the purple sea of trees to sway gently, like waves in a purple ocean.</p><p></p><p>The Sunset Thunder Forest! </p><p></p><p>The highest-level dangerous area in the Thunder Realm, it was also the training ground of the Great Sun Thunder Sect. It could be said that the Great Sun Thunder Sect was extremely familiar with this place.</p><p></p><p>At this moment, the sky above the Sunset Thunder Forest was already filled with countless cultivators, their numbers continuing to grow.</p><p></p><p>Numbering in the millions, even tens of millions, the sight was awe-inspiring, like a swarm of ants shaking the heavens.</p><p></p><p>They were all floating in a circular formation in the sky, carefully watching the sky, fearing that lightning might suddenly strike down.</p><p></p><p>They had come to witness this battle that exceeded their level, truly risking their lives...</p><p></p><p>Crack!!!</p><p></p><p>Suddenly, a thick bolt of lightning struck without warning!</p><p></p><p>The cultivators in that area were startled and frantically tried to dodge.</p><p></p><p>Boom!!</p><p></p><p>But still, thousands were too slow to evade and were struck by the lightning, instantly killed without a trace.</p><p></p><p>Seeing this, the cultivators' faces turned pale. The cost of watching this battle was too high - even before the battle had begun, many of the spectators had already died.</p><p></p><p>At this time, the Xuanhuo Sect, the Tianjian Pavilion, and other second-rank sects arrived.</p><p></p><p>Luye's voice rang out in the sky:</p><p></p><p>"Hehe, everyone should try to suppress your auras and conceal your spiritual energy further, that way you won't be struck by the lightning."</p><p></p><p>Hearing this, the countless cultivators in the sky were startled. So that was the reason.</p><p></p><p>They quickly followed Luye's instructions, and the lightning in the sky soon subsided.</p><p></p><p>The cultivators let out a long sigh of relief, and many of them reverently thanked Luye. They knew that this elder was Luye, the Sect Master of the Xuanhuo Sect, and the lean middle-aged man beside him was Li Tailing, the Pavilion Master of the Tianjian Pavilion.</p><p></p><p>These two could be considered the top experts in the human domain and the entire Linglang Heavens.</p><p></p><p>In the following period, due to the presence of these top-tier sect masters, the cultivators dared not speak, only whispering to each other.</p><p></p><p>The Sunset Thunder Forest fell silent, with only the muffled rumbling of thunder and the howling of the wind.</p><p></p><p>Everyone waited in silence.</p><p></p><p>Swoosh swoosh swoosh‚Äî!</p><p></p><p>At this moment, numerous sonic booms suddenly rang out, and the crowd's gaze sharpened as they looked towards the central area.</p><p></p><p>Over 20,000 figures stood there in an orderly manner.</p><p></p><p>The Great Sun Thunder Sect!!</p><p></p><p>And the moment they took their positions, it seemed as if they were connected to the heavens above, as the thunderous roars grew increasingly violent, even bordering on uncontrollable!</p><p></p><p>Rumble!</p><p></p><p>Finally, the thunderclouds in the sky could no longer bear the burden, and dense chains of golden red lightning bolts suddenly struck down!!</p><p></p><p>This made the cultivators shudder again, filled with fear.</p><p></p><p>At this moment, Zhong Wuyan suddenly raised his right palm towards the sky, spreading his five fingers, and a mysterious mark in the center of his palm began to glow.</p><p></p><p>The next instant, the countless golden red lightning bolts seemed to be attracted, their direction abruptly changing and striking towards Zhong Wuyan's palm.</p><p></p><p>But these numerous golden red lightning bolts were effortlessly absorbed by his palm, to the shock of all who witnessed it.</p><p></p><p>Zhong Wuyan expressionlessly withdrew his hand, his gaze sweeping across the crowd. Except for a few top-tier experts, no one dared to meet his eyes.</p><p></p><p>His brow furrowed slightly as he asked indifferently, "Has the Xiaoyao Sect arrived?"</p>

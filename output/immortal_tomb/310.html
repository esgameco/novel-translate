        <h1>Chapter 310</h1>
        <div class="content">
            <p>Here is the full English translation of the Chinese excerpt:</p><p></p><p>Jian Yan immediately waved his hand, and the flying boat stopped. </p><p></p><p>In the next moment, three sword lights flashed in front of the flying boat, transforming into a middle-aged man and a pair of young men and women!</p><p></p><p>"Oh? So it's the Sword Steward Jian Yan!" </p><p></p><p>The middle-aged man greeted Jian Yan, then swept his gaze fiercely towards Lu Changsheng and the others, and said with a smile, "Sword Steward Jian Yan, are these the top ten champions of this year's Heavenly Prodigy Assembly?"</p><p></p><p>The young man and woman behind him also scrutinized Lu Changsheng and the others, their gaze lingering on Lu Changsheng's bronze mask.</p><p></p><p>Jian Yan smiled slightly and cupped his hands, saying, "That's right, Sword Steward Jing, let them pass, the elder wishes to take them to see the Sixth Sword Master."</p><p></p><p>The middle-aged man smiled and was about to let them pass, but the young man and woman seemed to say something to him, causing him to raise his brows and look at Lu Changsheng, smiling, "Sword Steward Jian Yan, this Heavenly Prodigy has entered our Ancient Desolate Sword Clan, yet he still wears a mask. What, is he afraid to show his true face?"</p><p></p><p>The crowd was instantly startled.</p><p></p><p>Jian Yan's expression remained unchanged as he said, "Sword Steward Jing, are you being too lenient? Since when has our Ancient Desolate Sword Clan had a rule that forbids wearing masks when entering the clan?"</p><p></p><p>The middle-aged man's eyes narrowed slightly, as he felt that Jian Yan was acting a bit strange! </p><p></p><p>As fellow Sword Stewards of the Ancient Desolate Sword Clan, he was actually speaking to him in this manner, without giving him any face at all!</p><p></p><p>"Sword Steward Jian Yan, you're quite interesting, getting angry with me over such a trivial matter... Today, I must insist that he removes his mask!" the middle-aged man said indifferently.</p><p></p><p>Jian Yan's expression darkened, about to speak, when</p><p></p><p>"Enough nonsense."</p><p></p><p>Lu Changsheng spoke up lightly, and with a wave of his sleeve, he erased the middle-aged man and the young man and woman into nothingness.</p><p></p><p>Disregarding the stunned crowd, he said, "Let's go."</p><p></p><p>Since they had already arrived at the Ancient Desolate Sword Clan, he naturally had no qualms, and could be said to kill as he pleased. </p><p></p><p>The Ancient Desolate Sword Clan was right in front of them, could they really run away?</p><p></p><p>"Yes." </p><p></p><p>Jian Yan regained his senses and activated the flying boat, heading towards a grand building in the distance.</p><p></p><p>...</p><p></p><p>"Report to the Sword Master, Sword Steward Jian Yan has brought the ten Heavenly Prodigies of this year's assembly."</p><p></p><p>Inside the grand building, a Sword Servant bowed and said.</p><p></p><p>On the throne, the strange-looking young man who had been dozing opened his eyes and smiled faintly, "Have Sword Steward Jian Yan bring them in."</p><p></p><p>"Yes, sir!"</p><p></p><p>The Sword Servant turned and walked out.</p><p></p><p>"Sixth Uncle, I don't care, this time I want to pick the Sword Servants first! The Sword Servant from last time was just played to death in a few moves, so boring!"</p><p></p><p>"Hehe, you're such a pervert, the Heavenly Prodigies come in to be Sword Servants, yet you treat them like animals to play with, ugh!"</p><p></p><p>"Yes, for so long, you've played Sword Servants to death, you simply don't treat them as people at all!"</p><p></p><p>"Don't you all act like you have the moral high ground, we're all the same!"</p><p></p><p>"..."</p><p></p><p>Listening to the ten young men and women discussing animatedly below, the Sixth Sword Master on the throne felt a headache coming on.</p><p></p><p>He rubbed his brow and said, "Quiet, all of you."</p><p></p><p>Immediately, the young men and women fell silent, though their eyes still gleamed mischievously.</p><p></p><p>The Sixth Sword Master had nothing more to say about this, after all, these young men and women were all Heavenly Prodigies of his Ancient Desolate Sword Clan.</p><p></p><p>And the Sword Servants recruited were indeed assigned to the clan's Heavenly Prodigies.</p><p></p><p>As for how to handle them, he had no desire to bother with that.</p><p></p><p>He only knew that as long as he recruited the Heavenly Prodigies of those powers into the clan, it would form a monopoly.</p><p></p><p>"The Sword Steward has arrived!"</p><p></p><p>At this moment, the Sword Servant led Jian Yan and Lu Changsheng and the others into the grand hall.</p><p></p><p>Nan Gong Wanxin and the others immediately saw the strange-looking young man on the high throne gazing down at them.</p><p></p><p>Here is the full English translation of the Chinese excerpt:</p><p></p><p>A group of young men and women.</p><p></p><p>The prodigies of the Ancient Desolate Sword Clan!</p><p></p><p>[New 69 Book Bar]</p><p></p><p>After taking a look at them, they were secretly shocked in their hearts, truly worthy of being the prodigies of the Ancient Desolate Sword Clan, each of these ten people was at least a mid-stage Divine Yang Realm existence!</p><p></p><p>But Lu Changsheng was the first to look towards the strange young man on the throne, and the corners of his mouth slightly curled up.</p><p></p><p>Hmm, finally have some impression.</p><p></p><p>"Sword Rock pays respects to the Sword Master."</p><p></p><p>Sword Rock immediately bowed.</p><p></p><p>Nangong Wanxin and the others heard the name of the Sword Master, and quickly knelt down on the ground, trembling in fear.</p><p></p><p>They had previously heard the Sword Steward say that the Sword Master was an existence at the Divine Dao Realm.</p><p></p><p>Huh?</p><p></p><p>The Six Sword Masters' brows suddenly furrowed, he saw something, he saw that there were actually three prodigies who did not pay respects?</p><p></p><p>"Insolent! How dare you not pay respects to my clan's Sword Master, weren't you taught etiquette by your elders?!"</p><p></p><p>Immediately, one of the Ancient Desolate Sword Clan's prodigies stood out and shouted angrily.</p><p></p><p>Lu Changsheng stood calmly, while Li Shueyan and Xue Yaoyue were slightly nervous.</p><p></p><p>They knew that their master (owner) was about to reveal his cards and stir up trouble directly.</p><p></p><p>Just then, a startled cry came from outside the hall.</p><p></p><p>"Report to the Sword Master, the token of Sword Bell Steward has been shattered!"</p><p></p><p>The hall fell silent.</p><p></p><p>The prodigies of the Ancient Desolate Sword Clan looked at each other, the steward in the clan was an existence at the Divine Concealment Realm, there were only a few hundred of them, and they also had a high status, but now they heard that a steward had died?</p><p></p><p>The Six Sword Masters slowly stood up from the throne, the entire person like an unparalleled treasured sword!</p><p></p><p>He stared at Sword Rock and asked, "Wasn't Sword Bell guarding the boundary? Did you encounter him before?"</p><p></p><p>Sword Rock remained silent.</p><p></p><p>"I killed him."</p><p></p><p>At this moment, Lu Changsheng took a step forward, and in the midst of many horrified gazes, he slowly walked towards the throne where the Six Sword Masters stood.</p><p></p><p>The young men and women of the Ancient Desolate Sword Clan's eyes slightly changed, what's going on?</p><p></p><p>Isn't this person a prodigy? How does he have the ability to kill a steward, and how dare he walk so calmly towards the Sword Master!</p><p></p><p>"You?" </p><p></p><p>The Six Sword Masters' eyes flickered as he stared at the approaching Lu Changsheng, for some reason, his heart was being suppressed, making it a little hard to breathe...</p><p></p><p>"That's right, it was me."</p><p></p><p>Lu Changsheng stepped forward slowly, smiling lightly.</p><p></p><p>At this point, even a fool could see that this person had a purpose in coming.</p><p></p><p>The Six Sword Masters stood in place, staring intently at that bronze mask, and asked in a deep voice, "Then who are you, and what is your purpose in coming to my Ancient Desolate Sword Clan?"</p><p></p><p>Soon, Lu Changsheng stood in front of the Six Sword Masters, and said indifferently, "Do you still remember the Eternal Life Body?"</p><p></p><p>Boom!!</p><p></p><p>The Six Sword Masters' pupils shrank, his mind violently shook, and in the bewildered gaze of the crowd, he retreated half a step!</p><p></p><p>The Six Sword Masters' pupils trembled, staring fixedly at the bronze mask, "You... you actually broke through the seal..."</p><p></p><p>At this moment, the Six Sword Masters' heart was undoubtedly stirred up by a shocking wave!</p><p></p><p>If it were the top combat forces of the other seven clans here, he would not be too panicked, after all, it was they who had once joined forces to suppress the Lu Changsheng!</p><p></p><p>What they had once suppressed, they could naturally suppress again now!!</p><p></p><p>But the problem was, in the current situation, only his Ancient Desolate Sword Clan!</p><p></p><p>Lu Changsheng's threat to them was too great,</p><p></p><p>But fortunately, at the moment they were in the territory of the Ancient Desolate Sword Clan, Lu Changsheng wanted to take revenge, and it would not be so easy!!</p><p></p><p>The crowd couldn't understand what the two were talking about,</p><p></p><p>But their hearts were trembling, because they could see that the Six Sword Masters seemed to be afraid...</p><p></p><p>The next moment, as the Six Sword Masters retreated, he suddenly spoke, his solemn words echoing throughout the Ancient Desolate Sword Clan!!</p><p></p><p>"Clan Leader, Elders, all Sword Masters, he... he has come!!"</p>

        <h1>Chapter 518</h1>
        <div class="content">
            <p>Here is the full English translation of the Chinese excerpt:</p><p></p><p>"Crack!"</p><p></p><p>Eight energy crystals were shattered!</p><p></p><p>"Hahaha, if the fish dies, the net breaks! If the fish dies, the net breaks!!"</p><p></p><p>Seville's eyes were crazed, and he laughed recklessly, welcoming death.</p><p></p><p>Boom!!!!</p><p></p><p>Centered on Seville and the other Saint Demon Gods, that energy burst forth!!</p><p></p><p>In just a moment, Seville's eight Saint Demon Gods were reduced to nothingness!!</p><p></p><p>The violent energy instantly spread out, and all the Void-Devouring Saint Demons and soul bodies trying to flee were instantly melted, not even able to let out a scream!!</p><p></p><p>This scene left the onlookers with bulging eyes - they had never seen such a violent energy before, representing true destruction!</p><p></p><p>At this moment, the massive Eighth Creation Pillar even seemed to be shaking!!</p><p></p><p>And the endless void itself began to tremble as well!!</p><p></p><p>As the sense of death approached, despair and fear still surfaced in the eyes of the onlookers...</p><p></p><p>...</p><p></p><p>At the top of the Eighth Creation Pillar.</p><p></p><p>Just as the energy was about to engulf the despairing Old Turtle and Hunhun, </p><p></p><p>"Clang!!"</p><p></p><p>A brilliant azure sword beam slashed through from in front of them, forcefully severing the terrifying energy!!</p><p></p><p>But the horrifying energy was boiling, containing the might of the Eighth Creation Pillar, and even Lu Changsheng's sword could not withstand it for long.</p><p></p><p>"Master (Dao Venerable)!" Old Turtle and the others snapped out of it, calling out in a hoarse voice.</p><p></p><p>"You all leave!!"</p><p></p><p>Lu Changsheng's expression was solemn.</p><p></p><p>Old Turtle and Hunhun were stunned for a moment, then their faces turned deathly pale!!</p><p></p><p>Old Turtle anxiously shouted, "Master, let's all leave together!!"</p><p></p><p>"Scram!!"</p><p></p><p>But the next moment, they were forcefully teleported away by Lu Changsheng with a sweep of his sleeve.</p><p></p><p>"Reincarnation Demon Child, this Venerable does not kill you. I hope you will treat the masses kindly in the future and make up for your misdeeds."</p><p></p><p>These were Lu Changsheng's indifferent words, spoken last.</p><p></p><p>The Reincarnation Demon Child's eyes reddened, and he trembled as he opened his mouth to speak, but the scene before him turned to darkness.</p><p></p><p>...</p><p></p><p>Boom!!!!</p><p></p><p>The terrifying energy shook, like billions of suns exploding!</p><p></p><p>And Lu Changsheng was at the very center!!</p><p></p><p>Under this incomparable energy,</p><p></p><p>Lu Changsheng's long hair, blue robe, and flesh began to burn...</p><p></p><p>Lu Changsheng clasped his hands behind his back, slowly turning around, his clear eyes seemingly piercing through the endless void, through mountains and rivers, gazing at the onlookers.</p><p></p><p>This gaze left the onlookers bewildered.</p><p></p><p>Lu Changsheng's Adam's apple moved, his tone ethereal and calm,</p><p></p><p>"This Venerable, as the Lord of the Great Dao, is not unworthy of you all."</p><p></p><p>As his words fell, Lu Changsheng's body began to fade, to shatter, to disintegrate!</p><p></p><p>The Dao Eyes in his eyes flashed with a depth of blue light never seen before, illuminating the ages, illuminating the endless void!</p><p></p><p>In an instant, an incomparable might burst forth!</p><p></p><p>The terrifying energy that had been spreading in all directions towards the endless void was mysteriously and frantically drawn back, all of it devoured by the Dao Eyes!</p><p></p><p>At the same time, Lu Changsheng's gaze turned cold, his two fingers forming a sword, and he swung them fiercely towards the other seven Creation Pillars!!</p><p></p><p>"Clang!!"</p><p></p><p>The sword's speed pierced through space and time, shattering all the remaining Void-Devouring Saint Demons on the other seven Creation Pillars into fragments!</p><p></p><p>Finally, Lu Changsheng let out a long sigh, slowly sitting down in a cross-legged position and closing his eyes.</p><p></p><p>His body disintegrated, dissolving into countless points of light, merging into the Creation Pillar, nourishing the Creation Pillar's wounds.</p><p></p><p>The onlookers watched the gradually fading, gradually illusory blue-robed man with tears in their eyes, and bowed down in a grand manner!</p><p></p><p>"Dao Venerable!!!!!"</p><p></p><p>Boom! Suddenly, the scene shattered! The endless void became calm again!</p><p></p><p>It was as if the previous scenes had all been a dream!</p><p></p><p>...</p><p></p><p>"Master!! Master!!"</p><p></p><p>Outside the Eighth Creation Pillar, Old Turtle's body collapsed.</p><p></p><p>Here is my translation of the Chinese excerpt:</p><p></p><p>His eyes had lost their color, and he knew that was a wisp of Luchang Sheng's true self, but he just felt so sad, always feeling like he would never see him again.</p><p></p><p>Hunhui and the others also had their throats rolling and their eyes losing focus.</p><p></p><p>"The, the boss he......" </p><p></p><p>The Reincarnation Demon Child murmured.</p><p></p><p>......</p><p></p><p>Inside the Carefree Sect, there was a deathly silence. </p><p></p><p>Everyone was kneeling towards the sky, their hearts filled with sorrow.</p><p></p><p>Tongxin suddenly murmured, "The master absolutely has not died, the master is a Dao Venerable above the Nine Heavens. If the master died, the order of the boundless void would definitely be thrown into chaos! But now everything is calm, so the master must still be alive!!"</p><p></p><p>As he said this, Tongxin shouted out excitedly.</p><p></p><p>The Carefree Sect members were stunned for a moment, then reacted - ah, the sect master is a Dao Venerable, the sect master is invincible, how could he have died?!</p><p></p><p>So the sect master must still be alive, they just don't know where he is!!</p><p></p><p>No, they have to cultivate even harder, so that when the sect master returns, they won't have perished!</p><p></p><p>Peng Fang immediately roared, "Those who want to see the sect master again in the future, quickly go cultivate! Now is the time to compete for your lives!"</p><p></p><p>......</p><p></p><p>In the distant various worlds, many people who had met Luchang Sheng had expressions of dazed disbelief, unable to believe that the all-powerful blue-robed man they remembered could have just... everything felt like a dream.</p><p></p><p>......</p><p></p><p>......</p><p></p><p>"Changsheng, thank you, to save me you actually let a wisp of your true self be lost, I don't know when that wisp will be able to cultivate back."</p><p></p><p>"No matter, Xu, now the boundless void has stabilized, I must leave."</p><p></p><p>"Changsheng, where, where are you going?"</p><p></p><p>"Xu, I'm going to wander elsewhere, I've already sent out a small part of my Great Dao Eyes."  </p><p></p><p>"Wasn't it all extinguished? Can it be recovered? How did you do it?"</p><p></p><p>"You don't need to worry about that, I, Luchang Sheng, have my own ways."</p><p></p><p>"Okay... "</p><p></p><p>"That's enough, I'm leaving now."</p><p></p><p>"Changsheng, when you leave, what am I supposed to do? You have to come back quickly!"</p><p></p><p>"Do whatever you want, I've already helped so much this time, now I want to go enjoy a comfortable and pleasant life, I'm tired."</p><p></p><p>"...But when you leave this time, just like before, being interfered with by the Creation Pillar's rays and losing your memories, what will happen then?"</p><p></p><p>"This time is not like the last, when I could only hastily condense a wisp of true self to descend. After all these years, I've thoroughly condensed my true body, so the Creation Pillar can no longer interfere with my memories or weaken my strength. My true body's strength is billions upon billions of times greater than that wisp of true self, so what are you worried about?"</p><p></p><p>"What?! You actually condensed your true body while I was in slumber? Okay, you're impressive, so when will you come back? I'm the essence of the void, you're the Dao Venerable, we can't be without each other."</p><p></p><p>"I'll come back when I'm done playing."</p><p></p><p>After saying this, the void above fell into eternal silence, with only a light sigh from Xu.</p><p></p><p>"Ah, I really envy Changsheng, he can just leave whenever he wants."</p><p></p><p>"Searching for the Dao Eyes, just an excuse, the real reason is to enjoy life."</p><p></p><p>......</p><p></p><p>[The Invincible Dao Venerable is Complete]</p><p></p><p>For the fastest updates of flawless novels, please visit www.feixs.com</p><p></p><p>For mobile, please visit: https://m.feixs.com/chapter-45751-38225637</p>

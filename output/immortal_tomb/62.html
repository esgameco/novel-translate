        <h1>Chapter 62</h1>
        <div class="content">
            <p>Here is my translation of the Chinese excerpt:</p><p></p><p>Behind the Great Earth Dragon Bear,</p><p></p><p>Lu Changsheng's eyes flashed lightly, and then he looked at the Ancient Crane Forest with great interest. ‚ôô‚ôï‚ùª‚ûàÀ¢ƒß·ªÆ‚ìß.ùî†·µíÁà™üò≤‚úå</p><p></p><p>The old turtle seemed to have thought of something, his gaze slightly changing, and his eyes also fell on the Ancient Crane Forest.</p><p></p><p>"Lost? What could the Ancient One lose? Hehe, are you finally going to make a move against the Ancient One?"</p><p></p><p>The Ancient Crane Forest sneered.</p><p></p><p>In his eyes, this Great Earth Dragon Bear had been watching from the sidelines, not making a move against him, practically treating him like a mouse to be toyed with, not taking him seriously at all.</p><p></p><p>The Great Earth Dragon Bear pretended to be frightened, waving his hands repeatedly, "Oh no no no, this general would never make a move against the Venerable Ancient One, this general only wants to shatter your inner heart, that's all."</p><p></p><p>The Ancient Crane Forest scoffed: "Shatter the inner heart of the Ancient One? Even if the Heart Demon Tribulation has passed the Ancient One once, what makes you think you can?"</p><p></p><p>"What makes me?" </p><p></p><p>The Great Earth Dragon Bear looked at the Ancient Crane Forest inexplicably, then looked towards the town, sneering,</p><p></p><p>"Listen up, you insignificant ants, I'll give you two choices. This general means what he says. One, he dies. Two, you all die. Those who want him to die to save themselves, step forward. The rest choose the second option or have no choice, and you all die today, you have ten breaths to consider, begin."</p><p></p><p>As the words fell,</p><p></p><p>The tens of thousands of townspeople in Moyu Town immediately became restless!!</p><p></p><p>"What a vicious heart!"</p><p></p><p>Tong Xin's face changed drastically, and he looked at the Ancient Crane Forest with great concern.</p><p></p><p>"Shixi..." Lin Dong was a little at a loss.</p><p></p><p>Chen Dadao's heart trembled, and he turned around and shouted,</p><p></p><p>"All of you in the town, be quiet! Don't believe his words! No matter what choice you make today, he won't spare anyone! Ugh..."</p><p></p><p>But Chen Dadao hadn't finished shouting when he lost his voice.</p><p></p><p>He saw that many of the townspeople,</p><p></p><p>had basically not hesitated long before rushing out one by one, then standing tightly with their heads bowed, not uttering a word.</p><p></p><p>Looking at it, the number occupied half of Moyu Town.</p><p></p><p>Those townspeople who remained motionless had some struggling expressions, and some had resolute expressions.</p><p></p><p>Seeing this scene,</p><p></p><p>the Ancient Crane Forest's eyes faltered, losing focus, for a very long time.</p><p></p><p>"You, you all!"</p><p></p><p>Chen Dadao was furious, his hand trembling as he pointed at them, with a trace of blood at the corner of his mouth.</p><p></p><p>"Town Master." The steward quickly supported him.</p><p></p><p>"The Venerable Ancient One could have left by himself, but he didn't!"</p><p></p><p>"He was trying his best to protect all of you, even at the cost of his life!"</p><p></p><p>"This town master has been the master of Moyu Town for thirteen years, and I always thought the people of Moyu Town were simple and kind! I know you all want to live, after all, no one wants to die! But you all today... even if you had hesitated for three breaths..."</p><p></p><p>"Even if you live through today, won't you be haunted by guilt for the rest of your lives?"</p><p></p><p>"Can you face the Venerable Ancient One?!"</p><p></p><p>Chen Dadao shouted with tears in the corners of his eyes.</p><p></p><p>"Town Master..." The steward tightly supported the trembling Chen Dadao, his heart sorrowful.</p><p></p><p>The townspeople who stepped forward were deathly pale, gritting their teeth!</p><p></p><p>They just wanted to live, what was their fault!</p><p></p><p>..........</p><p></p><p>"Master, human nature... cannot withstand the test."</p><p></p><p>The old turtle looked at the dazed Ancient Crane Forest with pity and sighed.</p><p></p><p>"Didn't I know that? It's not like I was the one testing them."</p><p></p><p>Lu Changsheng said indifferently.</p><p></p><p>The old turtle coughed dryly and chuckled.</p><p></p><p>Lu Changsheng calmly looked at the Ancient Crane Forest and said softly, "If the Ancient Crane Forest can get through this and reaffirm his original intention, he will gain a deep understanding of his own Dao and benefit for life."</p><p></p><p>The old turtle was taken aback for a moment, then nodded in agreement.</p><p></p><p>..........</p><p></p><p>"Hahaha! Ancient One, quickly raise your head and look, quickly raise your head and look! What use is it to guard without regard for your life, when they will also guard you without regard for their lives?"</p><p></p><p>The Great Earth Dragon Bear stood with his hands on his hips, laughing triumphantly.</p><p></p><p>Here is the full English translation of the excerpt from the Chinese novel:</p><p></p><p>The laughter sounded extremely grating in the ears of the villagers who had stepped forward. Their bodies were trembling violently, yet they stubbornly kept their heads lowered, not daring to look at the helpless figure of Gu Helin.</p><p></p><p>"Hehe, Gu Venerable, so what now? I will ask you one last time, are you willing to join my demonic realm? Leave this mortal realm of warmth and coldness behind! I will help you exterminate these despicable ants!"</p><p></p><p>At this time, the Great Earth Dragon Bear finally asked this question again. </p><p></p><p>All that he had done before was just to set the stage for this moment.</p><p></p><p>As soon as these words were spoken, the villagers who had stepped forward suddenly raised their heads, looking at the Great Earth Dragon Bear with disbelief and terror in their eyes.</p><p></p><p>"Didn't you say you would spare us?!"</p><p></p><p>"You went back on your word!"</p><p></p><p>"......"</p><p></p><p>The Great Earth Dragon Bear impatiently shouted, "Shut up!"</p><p></p><p>The demonic beasts also let out terrifying roars.</p><p></p><p>Instantly, the villagers were so frightened that they dared not make a sound, their eyes filled with a lifeless despair.</p><p></p><p>"No, I will not join the demonic realm," Gu Helin said as he stood up and patted his hands.</p><p></p><p>Everyone was stunned, their pupils trembling wildly, their hearts filled with bitterness to the extreme.</p><p></p><p>"Huh? Have you gone mad? Even after all this, you still insist on protecting these ants?" The Great Earth Dragon Bear's pupils contracted as he roared angrily.</p><p></p><p>"It's not that I'm protecting them, I simply don't want to join your demonic realm," Gu Helin said expressionlessly.</p><p></p><p>"Alright then, since that's the case, you can die together with them. What a waste of your pill-refining skills." The Great Earth Dragon Bear took a deep breath, and as he leaped forward, he sneered, "All demons, hear my command! You have five breaths of time to crush them, Gu Helin is mine!"</p><p></p><p>"Yes!!" The demonic beasts obeyed the order, emanating a terrifying aura as they surged towards Moyu Village.</p><p></p><p>This horrifying scene stunned everyone, and then they instinctively began to flee in all directions. </p><p></p><p>However, due to the chaos, some people tripped and fell, leading to a stampede.</p><p></p><p>Cries of anguish filled the air.</p><p></p><p>"Master! You must escape! Don't worry about them or me and Lin Dong!" Tong Xin shouted at Gu Helin.</p><p></p><p>The aura of the Great Earth Dragon Bear was too terrifying, the master couldn't possibly resist him, but escaping should be no problem.</p><p></p><p>"You two, retreat."</p><p></p><p>Gu Helin turned and smiled gently at Tong Xin and Lin Dong, and then, before their horrified gaze, his abdomen began to swell...</p><p></p><p>"Master... no!" </p><p></p><p>Tong Xin and Lin Dong rushed towards Gu Helin, tears streaming down their faces.</p><p></p><p>Even the Great Earth Dragon Bear was stunned by this sight, and hastily retreated!</p><p></p><p>Although he was on par with a late-stage Nascent Soul cultivator, being faced with an early-stage Nascent Soul self-explosion, he would certainly sustain heavy injuries.</p><p></p><p>"Don't come over here!" Gu Helin shouted at Tong Xin and Lin Dong.</p><p></p><p>Tong Xin and Lin Dong ignored him, their eyes filled with determination.</p><p></p><p>Just as the situation was at a critical juncture,</p><p></p><p>Lu Changsheng appeared like a ghost in front of Gu Helin, gently tapping his abdomen with a finger.</p><p></p><p>Instantly, the swollen abdomen quickly subsided.</p><p></p><p>"Master! You... " Gu Helin was stunned for a moment, his face bitter.</p><p></p><p>He never expected Lu Changsheng to intervene, never expected...</p><p></p><p>"Master!" Tong Xin and Lin Dong slammed on the brakes, their faces filled with joy, but their tears continued to flow, they had been truly terrified.</p><p></p><p>Lu Changsheng glanced at the chaotic scene, and with a light wave of his sleeve, all the demonic beasts, villagers, and everyone in various poses were frozen in place!</p><p></p><p>The world suddenly fell silent.</p><p></p><p>Lu Changsheng's gaze turned to Gu Helin, scrutinizing him for a moment, and then softly asked, "Even after all this, you still disregard your life. Is it worth it?"</p><p></p><p>Gu Helin was taken aback, his eyes reddening as he smiled and said, "It is."</p><p></p><p>Lu Changsheng nodded slightly, without saying anything further.</p>

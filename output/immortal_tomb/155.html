        <h1>Chapter 155</h1>
        <div class="content">
            <p>Here is the full English translation of the excerpt from the Chinese novel:</p><p></p><p>Upon hearing this, </p><p></p><p>Zuo Choushan's gaze turned cold as he said in a chilling tone, "Are you serious?"</p><p></p><p>Su Qianghe's eyes were bloodthirsty as he replied, "Our Sect Master knows that you, Zuo Choushan, are a Xian Venerable of the sixth rank. But so what? Do you think you can hog all the Xiwun Liquor? Why don't you ask Yin Jiuguai and Zhao Wuyu if they agree with that!"</p><p></p><p>Although he had only had one cup, the Xiwun Liquor had already become Su Qianghe's life! </p><p></p><p>Zuo Choushan's previous words were tantamount to wanting his life!</p><p></p><p>"Haha, that's right, Lord Zuo, we understand your feelings. But not to mention us, there are many cultivators outside waiting in line eagerly... Your previous words were a bit inappropriate." Yin Jiuguai chuckled in a sinister tone.</p><p></p><p>Zhao Wuyu also nodded in agreement.</p><p></p><p>Zuo Choushan paused momentarily, temporarily restraining the urgency in his heart. Suddenly, an idea struck him!</p><p></p><p>Yes!</p><p></p><p>He must recruit this Lu Changsheng to the Tiansha Mansion!</p><p></p><p>If he could recruit him, wouldn't he have Xiwun Liquor to drink every day?</p><p></p><p>How wonderful, how wonderful...</p><p></p><p>However, Zuo Choushan knew he couldn't be hasty at the moment, so he silently immersed himself in enjoying the Xiwun Liquor.</p><p></p><p>Seeing this, Su Qianghe's expression softened, and he also sat back down, indulging himself in the liquor with a blissful expression.</p><p></p><p>The atmosphere became harmonious at that moment.</p><p></p><p>Just then, Left Qizhan's heart stirred, and she frantically poured herself drink after drink, soon flushing red in the face with a dazed look.</p><p></p><p>&lt;tt_keyword_ad data-title="Food and Beverage" data-tag="Premium Recommendations" data-type="1" data-value="1903"&gt;&lt;/tt_keyword_ad&gt;</p><p></p><p>And her wine jar was already empty.</p><p></p><p>"Uh, Sister Zhan, why are you drinking so fast? Such a peerless wine should be savored slowly," Left You, who was seated with her, couldn't help but ask in a concerned tone.</p><p></p><p>The young geniuses of the various factions, as well as Zuo Choushan and the others, also looked at her with surprise and a hint of reproach. Such drinking, truly a waste of this exquisite vintage!</p><p></p><p>To this, Left Qizhan remained expressionless.</p><p></p><p>Shortly after, the thorough drunkard Su Qianghe's wine jar also became empty, and he watched the last drop of wine fall into the cup, immediately turning his head and ordering, "Little Two, bring me two more jars!"</p><p></p><p>Tongxin smiled apologetically, "I'm afraid I can't, sir. The Xiwun Liquor in our tavern is limited to 200 jars per day, and each person is only allowed one jar per day."</p><p></p><p>What?!</p><p></p><p>Su Qianghe abruptly stood up in his slight drunkenness, the redness in his face quickly fading.</p><p></p><p>Zuo Choushan and the others were also taken aback, not expecting this.</p><p></p><p>"Little Two, why is this so?" Su Qianghe looked at Tongxin with a pained expression.</p><p></p><p>Tongxin, a bit flustered by his reaction, coughed and sighed, "Esteemed guests, you only know that the Xiwun Liquor tastes good, but you don't know how complex the brewing process is."</p><p></p><p>Hearing this, the crowd suddenly understood.</p><p></p><p>Indeed, this was the proper etiquette for a peerless vintage. If the Xiwun Liquor became commonplace, it would no longer be a peerless vintage.</p><p></p><p>Rarity makes things precious.</p><p></p><p>At the same same time!</p><p></p><p>Zuo Choushan and the others quickly glanced at the other table, at their own young geniuses' wine jars!</p><p></p><p>"Bao'er, Qizhan, you two should drink less and return the Xiwun Liquor," Zuo Choushan said calmly.</p><p></p><p>"Yes, you too! Quickly bring it back, you young ones don't know better, drinking alcohol?" Su Qianghe frowned as he looked at the two young geniuses of his faction.</p><p></p><p>Yin Jiuguai and Zhao Wuyu, though silent, also had sharp gazes fixed on their own young geniuses, the meaning unspoken.</p><p></p><p>Except for Left Qizhan, the young geniuses had bitter expressions as they silently brought the wine jars and placed them in front of their elders, then reluctantly returned to their seats.</p><p></p><p>Heavens, they had only had a little bit! </p><p></p><p>Inevitably, they enviously...</p><p></p><p>Here is the full English translation of the excerpt from the Chinese novel:</p><p></p><p>Glancing at Zuo Qizhan, he really had foresight. He also drank heavily just now.</p><p></p><p>"Hmm?"</p><p></p><p>Zuo Qishen saw that Zuo Qizhan did not move, feeling quite embarrassed, and his heart was also a bit unbalanced, after all, Su Qianghe and the others had brought two cups in front of them, while he only had one cup.</p><p></p><p>So he frowned impatiently and said, "A young lady like you, why are you drinking wine? Hurry up and bring it over!"</p><p></p><p>Zuo Qizhan's eyebrows furrowed slightly as she raised the wine pot and poured it down, saying softly, "Father... Lord, Qizhan was just thirsty and drank it quickly, there's none left."</p><p></p><p>Hearing this, Zuo Qishen felt depressed, but he couldn't say anything else.</p><p></p><p>Su Qianghe, Yin Jiuguai, and Zhao Wurou saw this and felt a little relieved. They cleared their throats and started to toast and drink.</p><p></p><p>Zuo Qishen sighed lightly, his eyes flickering as he poured a cup for himself, and then poured another.</p><p></p><p>He lightly tapped the table, and one of the cups of wine floated in front of Lu Changsheng, smiling, "Shopkeeper, would you like a drink?"</p><p></p><p>Su Qianghe and the others saw this and their expressions changed slightly, knowing what Zuo Qishen was trying to do.</p><p></p><p>So...</p><p></p><p>A moment later.</p><p></p><p>A total of four cups of wine were floating in front of Lu Changsheng.</p><p></p><p>"Haha, Shopkeeper, this Xiu Hun Niang is really the best wine I've ever had in my life, I'm very grateful, and I'll have a drink with you."</p><p></p><p>"Not bad, I wonder if the Shopkeeper has time today to come to my Control Puppet Dao, my puppet art has a certain reputation even in the entire Hei Sha Domain."</p><p></p><p>"What's so good about your Control Puppet Dao? They're all just wooden and iron lumps. In my opinion, Shopkeeper, you'd better go to my Ying You Tower, where there are countless beauties, and they are all virgin flowers. I wonder if the Shopkeeper is interested in picking them? With the Shopkeeper's powerful cultivation and unparalleled good looks, you must be loved by everyone in my tower."</p><p></p><p>"......" Zuo Qishen was a little unhappy, these people didn't come in order, it was really hateful!!</p><p></p><p>He didn't know what to say for a moment.</p><p></p><p>What could he say? Could he invite this Lu Changsheng to play with snakes in his Tian She Manor?</p><p></p><p>He gritted his teeth in secret, and simply stood up, raising his cup and said directly, "Shopkeeper, my Tian She Manor is now the number one force in this Qing Xuan Town, I wonder if the Shopkeeper is willing to join my Tian She Manor? As long as the Shopkeeper is willing, any conditions can be proposed!"</p><p></p><p>Seeing Zuo Qishen lay his cards on the table, Su Qianghe and the others' expressions changed slightly, they knew Zuo Qishen was a little anxious.</p><p></p><p>So, the three of them stood up one after another and said,</p><p></p><p>"Haha, the number one? This is what Lord Zuo claims, my Ju Fu Gang doesn't recognize it!"</p><p></p><p>"My Control Puppet Dao doesn't recognize it either."</p><p></p><p>"My Ying You Tower has never acknowledged Tian She Manor as the number one in Qing Xuan."</p><p></p><p>Zuo Qishen's face stagnated, and his expression became unpleasant. He ignored the three of them and walked straight to Lu Changsheng, saying, "Shopkeeper, what do you think?"</p><p></p><p>Lu Changsheng's eyebrows raised slightly, opening his eyes and sweeping his gaze over them, asking puzzledly,</p><p></p><p>"Hmm? What are you all doing? Is this Xiu Hun Niang not good to drink?"</p><p></p><p>Everyone: "......"</p><p></p><p>Wow, they had been arguing for half a day, and this Shopkeeper actually ignored them and fell asleep!</p><p></p><p>However, everyone knew that this Shopkeeper must have heard everything, and was just pretending not to know.</p><p></p><p>Zuo Qishen asked again, "Shopkeeper, are you willing to join my Tian She Manor? If the Shopkeeper has any requests, my Lord will do his best to fulfill them all!"</p><p></p><p>Zuo Qishen felt that he had already shown a lot of sincerity!!</p><p></p><p>Originally, even if he came to recruit today, he wouldn't have been so polite, but it was really the Xiu Hun Niang that completely won him over.</p><p></p><p>For the sake of being able to drink the Xiu Hun Niang every day in the future, he endured and endured.</p><p></p><p>Su Qianghe and the others were also unwilling to fall behind, and they all declared that if Lu Changsheng joined their forces, they would agree to any conditions!</p><p></p><p>Especially Su Qianghe, his face flushed red, and he had already completely gone crazy.</p><p></p><p>But the next moment, Lu Changsheng's words were like a bucket of cold water poured down.</p><p></p><p>"If you all don't want to drink, then leave."</p><p></p><p>The meaning was self-evident.</p>

        <h1>Chapter 479</h1>
        <div class="content">
            <p>Here is the full English translation of the Chinese excerpt:</p><p></p><p>It was not long after the Sea Transport No. 3 had set sail when the captain personally came to the deck and, amidst many questioning gazes, found Lü Changsheng and respectfully said:</p><p></p><p>"My lord, this place is not befitting of your noble status. We have a top-tier suite on the Sea Transport No. 3, please allow me to escort you there."</p><p></p><p>The cultivators heard this and their eyes were filled with envy! They had heard of the top-tier suites before - they were not for public sale, but were used by the Sea Transport Guild to accommodate distinguished guests! </p><p></p><p>Today, they were able to witness it.</p><p></p><p>However, the cultivators could only admire it, and did not dare to feel jealous or have any objections. The young man in the green robe completely deserved it. After all, in the end, it was all about one's own strength.</p><p></p><p>Chen Pang and Xiao Chai silently watched, but their minds were still a bit dazed after the previous events. They never expected that the random person they had struck up a conversation with was actually the most formidable figure on the ship...</p><p></p><p>At the same time, Lü Changsheng opened his eyes, looked at the respectful and anxious captain standing before him, and although he had initially wanted to refuse, he seemed to have suddenly remembered something. He then turned his head to look at Chen Pang and Xiao Chai, and smiled:</p><p></p><p>"You two were saying you wanted to stay in the luxurious suite, right? Come along."</p><p></p><p>Lü Changsheng then stood up, looked at the captain, and gestured for him to lead the way.</p><p></p><p>"Yes, yes, yes... My lord, please!" </p><p></p><p>The captain understood, made a gesture inviting them, and then turned and led the way.</p><p></p><p>As for Chen Pang and Xiao Chai, who were huddled there, their minds were completely blank, their lips opening and closing to express their inner turmoil. </p><p></p><p>They never expected that their casual remark earlier had been remembered by such an important figure.</p><p></p><p>The two were both amazed and moved, but also at a loss. How could people like them possibly be qualified to stay in a top-tier suite?</p><p></p><p>Chen Pang glanced at his older brother, then looked at Lü Changsheng's retreating back and said in a trembling voice:</p><p></p><p>"M-m-m-my lord, we... we'll just stay here with my big brother, it's fine."</p><p></p><p>Lü Changsheng paused in his steps, then continued to follow the captain, saying, "Don't dilly-dally."</p><p></p><p>"Yes, yes..." Chen Pang and Xiao Chai were startled, quickly agreed, and then hurried to catch up, under the envious gazes of the other cultivators.</p><p></p><p>"Again, these two... How did the lord come to know them?"</p><p></p><p>"I vaguely remember, I think these two were sitting in the same spot as the lord when they first boarded the ship."</p><p></p><p>"Goodness, these two are so lucky, to be able to stay in the top-tier suite on the Sea Transport ship. I don't know if I'll ever have the chance in my lifetime."</p><p></p><p>"Don't dream about it. How could the likes of you stay there? The Sea Transport Guild is no ordinary guild, they even have branches in the Dao Realm, and only figures of great importance can stay in the top-tier suites. You, who haven't even grasped the Dao, how could you possibly?"</p><p></p><p>"Hey, why are you talking like that, as if you're some great expert? If you're so amazing, then why are you out here on the deck with the rest of us?"</p><p></p><p>"I never said I was amazing. I'm just telling you not to have unrealistic fantasies!"</p><p></p><p>"Tch!"</p><p></p><p>"..."</p><p></p><p>...</p><p></p><p>The captain soon brought Lü Changsheng and the others to the entrance of the top-tier suite.</p><p></p><p>"My lord, this is it."</p><p></p><p>The captain said respectfully, then inserted a jade token into a formation, and the door to the room opened.</p><p></p><p>The captain reverently held the jade token out to Lü Changsheng: "My lord, this is the room key. Please keep it safe."</p><p></p><p>Lü Changsheng took the key, and with a faint smile, asked, "How much is the room fee?"</p><p></p><p>The captain was startled, and hurriedly bowed, saying, "My lord, you jest. Your stay is the honor of the Sea Transport Guild, there is no need to speak of room fees..."</p><p></p><p>"Good, you may go now." Lü Changsheng nodded slightly and then stepped into the room.</p><p></p><p>Here is the full English translation of the Chinese excerpt:</p><p></p><p>"What, we're going in too?" </p><p></p><p>Chen Pang scratched his head and asked the captain.</p><p></p><p>The captain didn't dare to neglect Chen Pang and Xiao Chai, and smiled with cupped hands, "Please, esteemed guests."</p><p></p><p>Chen Pang and Xiao Chai exchanged a glance, never having imagined that one day they would become the esteemed guests of the maritime merchant association...</p><p></p><p>Afterwards, under the captain's watchful gaze, Chen Pang and Xiao Chai also carefully stepped into the room.</p><p></p><p>Seeing this, the captain finally wiped the cold sweat from his forehead and slowly let out a sigh of relief. </p><p></p><p>He had no idea how nervous he was when facing that man in blue.</p><p></p><p>He had been ferrying passengers and sailing back and forth on this sea for many years.</p><p></p><p>He had encountered sea demonic cultivators before, </p><p></p><p>but this was the first time he had encountered nine ships at once, just like today.</p><p></p><p>This was also the first time he had seen someone kill sea demonic cultivators as easily as slaughtering pigs and dogs.</p><p></p><p>The captain was always very confident in his own judgment, and he knew that this man in blue must be a terrifying existence, and might even be an influential figure in the Realm of the Dao.</p><p></p><p>Such a person, he must be served well!</p><p></p><p>After all, there were many branches of the maritime merchant association on the Realm of the Dao side, and it was very necessary to leave a good impression on an important figure.</p><p></p><p>...</p><p></p><p>In the top-tier suite.</p><p></p><p>Chen Pang and Xiao Chai were already shocked, because... it was simply too luxurious!</p><p></p><p>As far as the eye could see, everything was dazzling and brilliant, and the faint fragrance that lingered in the air seemed to be able to calm one's heart instantly.</p><p></p><p>But Chen Pang and Xiao Chai couldn't calm down at all, not at all.</p><p></p><p>The top-tier suite was a self-contained space, very large, like a huge castle, with all kinds of facilities, shining with precious treasures, all of which demonstrated the status and nobility of the occupant.</p><p></p><p>And... and there were also many maidservants who came at a call and left at a wave!</p><p></p><p>Chen Pang couldn't help but approach one of the maidservants,</p><p></p><p>The maidservant immediately bowed and said, "Esteemed guest, if you have any needs, please feel free to tell me."</p><p></p><p>As the maidservant bowed, a patch of snow-white skin was revealed.</p><p></p><p>Chen Pang's eyes immediately widened, and then his face turned bright red, hastily saying "I don't have any needs," and then ran to Xiao Chai's side as if fleeing, supporting his knees and panting heavily.</p><p></p><p>Xiao Chai was puzzled: "Fatty, what's wrong with you? Why is your face so red?"</p><p></p><p>Chen Pang forced himself to calm down and chuckled: "Big brother, it's nothing, I've just never seen such a big and white maidservant before, and I was a bit nervous for a moment."</p><p></p><p>Such a big and white maidservant?</p><p></p><p>Xiao Chai listened in a daze, and couldn't be bothered to ask more. He looked around and said, "Fatty, if we weren't with the elder, I'm afraid we could never set foot in a place like this in our entire lives."</p><p></p><p>Chen Pang nodded solemnly.</p><p></p><p>It's not that this place is particularly luxurious, Chen Pang and Xiao Chai have been to places even more luxurious than this.</p><p></p><p>But this place is different, the people who can enter this top-tier suite are all symbols of identity and strength.</p><p></p><p>This is the key difference.</p><p></p><p>"Let's go find the elder," Xiao Chai said, walking deeper into the suite.</p><p></p><p>Chen Pang was a bit hesitant: "Big brother, I'm afraid..."</p><p></p><p>Xiao Chai paused: "Afraid of what, as long as we behave ourselves, the elder won't have the heart to kill us..."</p><p></p><p>But as soon as he finished speaking, Xiao Chai also felt a bit uneasy.</p><p></p><p>At the same time,</p><p></p><p>In another luxurious suite, two elven maidens were conversing.</p><p></p><p>One of the elves suddenly asked,</p><p></p><p>"Rin, what do you think the strength of that man in blue is?"</p>

        <h1>Chapter 164</h1>
        <div class="content">
            <p>Here is the full English translation of the Chinese excerpt:</p><p></p><p>In the sky, ‚ò¢üê†6‚ùæ≈úùìó‚ì§À£.‚ìíœÉ‚ìúüéâüèÜ</p><p></p><p>Four blurry figures swiftly darted across.</p><p></p><p>"Is that the Qingxuan Town ahead?" Jiang Chu asked.</p><p></p><p>"Haha, yes, it is. This journey has been quite tiring for you two elders Jiang," Kunlun Yu said apologetically.</p><p></p><p>Jiang Chu slightly furrowed his brows but didn't say anything. Instead, the usually more silent Jiang Chong asked, "Your Black Abyss Domain has about twenty major cities and over a hundred small towns, and the distances between them are so far. Why don't you establish teleportation arrays?"</p><p></p><p>Kunlun Yu and the Vice Palace Master exchanged a bitter smile.</p><p></p><p>Establishing teleportation arrays would certainly be more convenient. Who wouldn't know that?</p><p></p><p>Kunlun Yu sighed helplessly, "Elder Jiang, the cities and towns in the Black Abyss Domain have their own powers. They won't agree to it."</p><p></p><p>The Vice Palace Master also said, "Yes, long ago, some major cities did want to establish teleportation arrays to consolidate the small towns in the Black Abyss Domain. But this place is filled with ruthless people. If their biggest interests are threatened, the cities and towns will unite against the outside. It's very difficult to intervene. Later, the Domain Lord even issued a decree prohibiting the establishment of teleportation arrays between the major cities and towns in the Black Abyss Domain, and it has been that way since then."</p><p></p><p>Hearing this, Jiang Chu and Jiang Chong nodded in understanding. It made sense for the Black Abyss Domain.</p><p></p><p>"Haha, we'll soon arrive at Qingxuan Town. I wonder how extraordinary this famed Washing Soul Liquor really is?" the Vice Palace Master licked his lips and chuckled.</p><p></p><p>Huh?</p><p></p><p>Jiang Chu and Jiang Chong's brows furrowed at this.</p><p></p><p>Seeing this, Kunlun Yu quickly turned his head and sternly said, "Vice Palace Master! Our main task is to help the two Elders Jiang find someone. Drinking is just a side matter. Don't mix up the priorities!"</p><p></p><p>The Vice Palace Master's expression changed slightly, and he replied in a hoarse voice, "Palace Master, Elders Jiang, I naturally know the priorities."</p><p></p><p>...</p><p></p><p>Peng Fang had spent a large sum to buy a small courtyard near the Longevity Wine House.</p><p></p><p>He didn't know where he got a rocking chair, which he placed in the courtyard under the sunlight and lay down on it.</p><p></p><p>"Ah, the innkeeper really knows how to enjoy life. This rocking chair is indeed comfortable, rocking back and forth~" Peng Fang sighed contentedly.</p><p></p><p>Then he looked towards the Longevity Wine House, where a long queue was lining up.</p><p></p><p>Peng Fang clicked his tongue and started counting on his fingers, soon frowning worriedly.</p><p></p><p>"Ah, according to the queue list, I'll have to wait for over ten days before I can drink the Washing Soul Liquor... How am I going to endure this?"</p><p></p><p>"Hm?"</p><p></p><p>Suddenly, Peng Fang's brows raised, and he sat up from the rocking chair. His gaze was fixed on the distant horizon.</p><p></p><p>"A Nine-Rank Immortal Venerable, a One-Turning Immortal Emperor, and two Two-Turning Immortal Emperors?"</p><p></p><p>Peng Fang's eyes flickered, and he slowly lay back down. He wanted to see what purpose these four people had in coming to Qingxuan Town...</p><p></p><p>Thinking of Lu Changsheng, he couldn't help but wonder if these people were here for the innkeeper. He was certain he had nothing to do with them. Other than the unfathomable Lu Changsheng, Peng Fang really couldn't think of anyone else in Qingxuan Town who could attract such powerful Immortal Emperors.</p><p></p><p>Oh well, he'll just observe the situation quietly.</p><p></p><p>With that thought, Peng Fang turned on his side on the rocking chair, his eyes fixed unblinkingly on the Longevity Wine House.</p><p></p><p>...</p><p></p><p>On the streets of Qingxuan Town, the four figures were walking slowly, their gazes discreetly scanning the faces of every person they passed.</p><p></p><p>The copper mirror in Jiang Chu's hand showed no reaction.</p><p></p><p>Kunlun Yu smiled and asked, "Elder Jiang, we've traveled so far. Shall we go to the Longevity Wine House for a drink first?"</p><p></p><p>The Vice Palace Master's eyes lit up at the mention of this, and he swallowed hard, feeling a little tempted.</p><p></p><p>To be continued...</p><p></p><p>Here is the full English translation of the Chinese excerpt:</p><p></p><p>Before, he did not dare to speak up easily, in comparison, after all, he was just a ninth-rank immortal lord.</p><p></p><p>As the lord of the palace, being a transcendent immortal emperor, he still had some right to speak in the presence of the two members of the Jiang clan imperial family.</p><p></p><p>Jiang Chu sighed and said, "Alright, let's go have a drink first."</p><p></p><p>The Longevity Wine Hall in Qingxuan Town was known to everyone, and the four of them soon knew the location and walked over there at a leisurely pace.</p><p></p><p>While walking, they scanned every person on the road, not missing a single one.</p><p></p><p>"Ah, it's so wonderful, after today, it will be a long time before I can drink the soul-cleansing brew again."</p><p></p><p>"Hehe, good things can't be drunk every day, it's the lingering feeling that matters."</p><p></p><p>"......"</p><p></p><p>Outside the Longevity Wine Hall, a group of cultivators reluctantly walked out of the courtyard gate.</p><p></p><p>"After drinking, hurry up and leave, what's with the chatter?" the upright-standing Left Qiou Shan growled.</p><p></p><p>The crowd was startled and quickly walked out.</p><p></p><p>But at this moment, they saw four figures approaching the courtyard entrance without lining up!</p><p></p><p>On the rocking chair, Peng Fang's eyes gradually narrowed...</p><p></p><p>And as the gatekeeper, Left Qiou Shan was the first to see them!</p><p></p><p>In an instant, his pupils shrank sharply...</p><p></p><p>The two elders in the middle... he recognized them even if they turned to ashes!</p><p></p><p>The Jiang... clan... imperial family!</p><p></p><p>They've come again...</p><p></p><p>"Hey, who are you four? Don't you know you need to line up and register?"</p><p></p><p>"Are you new here? Don't you even know the rules of the Longevity Wine Hall?"</p><p></p><p>"Qiou Shan, these people..."</p><p></p><p>Suddenly, the cultivators waiting in line outside were displeased, especially the next batch who were about to go in, they were the most unhappy.</p><p></p><p>"Hmm?"</p><p></p><p>The deputy palace master saw Jiang Chu and Jiang Chong's expressions darken slightly, and his heart tightened. He abruptly released the immortal lord's aura to suppress them!</p><p></p><p>"Ah!! Immortal... lord..."</p><p></p><p>Immediately, there were cries of agony. </p><p></p><p>The cultivators waiting in line were crushed to the ground, coughing up fresh blood. </p><p></p><p>Some were even scattered and had their vitality shattered, including those who had just expressed their displeasure.</p><p></p><p>This all happened in the blink of an eye, and no one had time to react.</p><p></p><p>In the distance, Peng Fang abruptly sat up, his face turning gloomy, and slowly walked over here...</p><p></p><p>It seems these four people have come to cause trouble...</p><p></p><p>At the same time, Left Qiou Shan clenched his fist, his expression ferocious!</p><p></p><p>Although his cultivation is still not enough, he should avoid these people and develop in secret, but this has happened...</p><p></p><p>He is the gatekeeper of the Longevity Wine Hall after all!</p><p></p><p>And he received the owner's grace just yesterday!</p><p></p><p>"Daring to cause trouble in the Longevity Wine Hall! Crushing the customers of the Longevity Wine Hall! Arrogant!"</p><p></p><p>Left Qiou Shan's eyes were bloodshot, and with a sweep of his sleeve, a multicolored venomous snake emerged from his sleeve!</p><p></p><p>In the blink of an eye, it transformed into a giant snake thousands of feet long, coiling its body in front of Jiang Chu and the others.</p><p></p><p>Hissing with a chilling venom, its scarlet snake eyes stared fixedly at them.</p><p></p><p>The battle was about to begin.</p><p></p><p>Oh? A seventh-rank immortal lord?</p><p></p><p>Kunlun Jue and the deputy palace master's eyes showed a hint of surprise.</p><p></p><p>But Jiang Chu and Jiang Chong exchanged a glance, their eyes flashing with an unreadable light...</p><p></p><p>Jiang Chu stepped forward, looking at Left Qiou Shan and asking in a stern voice, "What is your name? Old me feels a strange familiarity with you..."</p>

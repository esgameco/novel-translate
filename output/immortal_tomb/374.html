        <h1>Chapter 374</h1>
        <div class="content">
            <p>Here is the full English translation of the Chinese excerpt:</p><p></p><p>The deeds of Lu Changsheng in the Seven-Colored Jade Pagoda were quickly spread throughout the entire human domain, and everyone was shocked and thoroughly remembered this name.</p><p></p><p>Of course, immediately following this, there was a chilling and soaring feeling.</p><p></p><p>Everyone was in a panic.</p><p></p><p>In the Lord's Palace of the Human City.</p><p></p><p>The five Human Lords, including Jian Wuhui, were seated in the high hall, with three Shen Youjing and over a hundred Shen Xuanjing below.</p><p></p><p>It can be said that the top combat power of the entire human race was concentrated here.</p><p></p><p>At this moment, the atmosphere in the hall was solemn, and the people below were all bowing their heads in silence.</p><p></p><p>Jian Wuhui swept his gaze over the crowd and said in a deep voice:</p><p></p><p>"This time, our human race will face the greatest calamity in history."</p><p></p><p>After pausing, he continued: "But it may not be a bad opportunity for a rise. Danger and opportunity coexist, as it has been from ancient times to the present!"</p><p></p><p>"So you don't need to be too panicked, and don't blame Lu Changsheng. You all know that our human race has a great calamity."</p><p></p><p>"Even if there was no such incident, after the Seven-Colored Jade Pagoda, we would still have to face the pressure from dozens of other races. If a real fight breaks out, it would not be much better than facing the pressure from all the tribes..."</p><p></p><p>The Human Lords like Jiang Wuxin and the strong ones all nodded, what the Sword Venerable said was the truth.</p><p></p><p>Even if there was no incident at the Seven-Colored Jade Pagoda, their human race would still face the disaster of extinction!</p><p></p><p>If those dozens of tribes really came to encircle and suppress them, the probability of the human race withstanding it would be extremely low!</p><p></p><p>Jian Wuhui suddenly smiled: "Moreover, I am quite grateful to the young friend Lu..."</p><p></p><p>Jiang Wuxin and the others were slightly stunned, but soon understood!</p><p></p><p>While the strong ones were puzzled, Jian Wuhui explained:</p><p></p><p>"Not only did Young Friend Lu make our human race famous, but more importantly, he seized 16,666 Jade Hearts, and these Jade Hearts... will be a major bargaining chip for us to overcome the crisis!"</p><p></p><p>The strong ones were stunned for a moment, and then suddenly realized, their faces showing joy!</p><p></p><p>Jian Wuhui smiled and said, "So we should be grateful to Young Friend Lu. In fact, with this said, although we are now facing all the tribes, it is much better than facing those dozens of tribes!"</p><p></p><p>The strong ones all nodded after hearing this, the Sword Venerable's overall perspective was indeed stronger than theirs!</p><p></p><p>"The Sword Venerable is right, it's just a pity that Friend Changsheng didn't come back... trapped in the Seven-Colored Jade Pagoda, the next time it opens will be in 5 million years." Mang Tian shook his head and sighed.</p><p></p><p>Now the five lords roughly knew Lu Changsheng's strength, although they didn't know how he managed to sneak past the sensing barrier and enter the Seven-Colored Jade Pagoda, they knew his cultivation was at least at the Shen Youjing realm.</p><p></p><p>Jian Wuhui fell silent for a moment.</p><p></p><p>At this time, Han Jinlong suddenly said, "Perhaps Friend Changsheng has a way to get out?"</p><p></p><p>Oh?</p><p></p><p>Jian Wuhui and the others looked at Han Jinlong, their eyes slightly hopeful.</p><p></p><p>Han Jinlong pursed his lips and said, "I'm not very clear, but according to what Fang Yan said, it seems that Friend Changsheng deliberately stayed inside because he had something to attend to. Since he dared to stay inside, who knows if he has a way to get out?"</p><p></p><p>"Moreover, the fact that Friend Changsheng could sneak past the sensing barrier and enter the Seven-Colored Jade Pagoda doesn't it just prove his abilities?"</p><p></p><p>Saying this, Han Jinlong looked at the astonished and pensive crowd, and then looked at Jian Wuhui, cupping his hands and saying:</p><p></p><p>"Sword Venerable, may I boldly ask, can you sneak past the sensing barrier and enter the Seven-Colored Jade Pagoda?"</p><p></p><p>Jian Wuhui was silent for a moment, and then quickly said, "This Venerable will not boast, I should not be able to."</p><p></p><p>He focused on cultivating the Sword Dao, emphasizing slaughter, and was indeed not good at these things.</p><p></p><p>But this precisely shows the extraordinary abilities of Young Friend Lu!</p><p></p><p>On the Shen Mo Battlefield, if...</p><p></p><p>Here is the full English translation of the Chinese excerpt:</p><p></p><p>The powerful experts above the Mysterious Realm can already have infiltrated the Seven-Colored Crystal Tower. How could they possibly wait for Lu Xiaoyou?</p><p></p><p>New 69 Book Bar â†’ 69shu.com</p><p></p><p>Hiss!</p><p></p><p>Hearing Jian Wumei's words, the crowd couldn't help but take a slight breath of coolness.</p><p></p><p>Especially people like Fang Yun, their reverence for Lu Changsheng grew even deeper!</p><p></p><p>Moreover, after Lord Golden Wheel's analysis, it seems that Senior Lu Changsheng might actually have a way to get out of the Seven-Colored Crystal Tower!</p><p></p><p>Otherwise, who would deliberately stay there with a brain full of bubbles?</p><p></p><p>That's 500,000 years, after all!</p><p></p><p>Definitely not a short period of time, and who knows what dangers might lurk if one stays there too long.</p><p></p><p>"Lord Golden Wheel's words make perfect sense. Since that's the case, I hope our Dao Companion Changsheng will return soon, for he is a great contributor to our human race," Mang Tian chuckled.</p><p></p><p>Jiang Wuxin and the others nodded silently. After Han Jinlong's analysis, they felt much more at ease about Lu Changsheng in the Seven-Colored Crystal Tower.</p><p></p><p>"Let's not talk about Lu Xiaoyou for now. The priority now is to discuss how to get through the upcoming difficulties," Jian Wumei waved his hand and said.</p><p></p><p>Hearing this, the crowd quieted down, all eyes turning to Jian Wumei, listening attentively.</p><p></p><p>They knew that since the Sword Sovereign had spoken, he must have a plan.</p><p></p><p>"Sword Sovereign, please give us your instructions," the four human race representatives bowed.</p><p></p><p>Jian Wumei nodded slightly, his eyes flickering as he said:</p><p></p><p>"Among the myriad races, the top 100 races must not be offended. For the top 10 great clans, offer 300 Crystalline Hearts to the Celestial Race, and 200 Crystalline Hearts to the other 9 clans."</p><p></p><p>Jiang Wuxin and the others solemnly nodded. By this calculation, the top 10 peak clans alone would be sending out 2,100 Crystalline Hearts.</p><p></p><p>Jian Wumei continued, "From the 11th to the 20th, send 100 each, from the 21st to the 50th, send 80 each, and from the 51st to the 100th, send 50 each."</p><p></p><p>The crowd nodded again, doing a quick calculation. In total, for the top 100 clans, they would be sending out 8,000 Crystalline Hearts.</p><p></p><p>They still had 8,666 Crystalline Hearts in their possession.</p><p></p><p>At this point, every single Crystalline Heart had to be carefully accounted for.</p><p></p><p>But as for the other races beyond the top 100, what should they do...?</p><p></p><p>If those races exerted pressure, their human race would still be unable to withstand it!</p><p></p><p>Jian Wumei's gaze focused slightly as he continued, "For the top 10 great clans, each clan will also receive an additional 100 Crystalline Hearts as a bonus... on the condition that they help our human race withstand the pressure!"</p><p></p><p>Hiss!</p><p></p><p>This plan is feasible!!</p><p></p><p>Even after sending out so many Crystalline Hearts, they would still have 7,666 left in their possession, a terrifying number!</p><p></p><p>The only problem is... will those peak clans really agree to this?</p><p></p><p>Although the peak clans will receive a lot of Crystalline Hearts, do they really want the human race to end up with 7,666 Crystalline Hearts, becoming the ultimate winner?</p><p></p><p>Clearly, that's impossible...</p><p></p><p>Just as the crowd was racking their brains, Jian Wumei slowly stood up, looking at Han Jinlong and Jiang Wuxin, and asked with a smile:</p><p></p><p>"Wind Sovereign, Golden Wheel King, I'm sure no one knows how many Crystalline Hearts our human race actually obtained from the Seven-Colored Crystal Tower, right?"</p><p></p><p>Jiang Wuxin and Han Jinlong were stunned for a moment, then suddenly realized!</p><p></p><p>The crowd also understood at this moment!</p><p></p><p>That's right, how many Crystalline Hearts they obtained in the Seven-Colored Crystal Tower is for the human race to decide.</p><p></p><p>As long as they keep the Crystalline Hearts within a reasonable range and tell the others that they didn't get any, what can the others do?</p><p></p><p>Moreover, the Crystalline Hearts obtained this time are indeed more than previous sessions, sending out a total of 9,000 Crystalline Hearts is also very reasonable.</p>

        <h1>Chapter 349</h1>
        <div class="content">
            <p>Here is my translation of the Chinese excerpt:</p><p></p><p>Han Jinlong saw that Yan Jueyi seemed to be pondering, so he spoke in a measured tone:</p><p></p><p>"Cane Saint, we must absolutely keep Little Friend Lu in the Human City!"</p><p></p><p>"Mm, I understand the meaning of the Golden Wheel King," Yan Jueyi nodded slightly. </p><p></p><p>In the territory of the human race, there are the three cities of Heaven, Earth, and Human. Currently, in terms of core combat power, the Human City is slightly behind.</p><p></p><p>If they could bring this Little Friend Lu into the Human City, then next time he and Han Jinlong would be able to hold their heads high in front of the Savage King and Wind Venerable.</p><p></p><p>Thinking this, Yan Jueyi continued:</p><p></p><p>"Since the Golden Wheel King has met that Little Friend Lu, I suppose you've sounded him out?"</p><p></p><p>"Mm, but Little Friend Lu didn't give a direct answer to the King. What he said was ambiguous," Han Jinlong said helplessly.</p><p></p><p>Yan Jueyi let out a long laugh: "You just need to bring up your identity as the Golden Wheel King, I don't believe that Little Friend Lu won't show you face."</p><p></p><p>"Tch!" Han Jinlong waved his hands repeatedly. "No, no, we can't let Little Friend Lu know that the somewhat carefree young man in the ink-black robe was me in disguise!"</p><p></p><p>As one of the five overlords of the human race, Han Jinlong had to maintain his image!</p><p></p><p>Yan Jueyi let out a cold laugh and mocked, "Trying to have it both ways."</p><p></p><p>"Hey, how dare you speak to me like that!" Han Jinlong gritted his teeth.</p><p></p><p>Yan Jueyi chuckled, picked up his wine cup, took a sip, and said, "I guess you want to have Little Friend Lu participate in the Seven-Colored Crystal Tower competition, so he can naturally join our Human City then, right?"</p><p></p><p>Han Jinlong looked at Yan Jueyi in surprise. "Although your mouth is sharp, I have to admit you do understand the King."</p><p></p><p>Yan Jueyi glanced at him and said, "Otherwise? The competition for the Seven-Colored Crystal Tower, our human race has to send nine people, the Heaven City three, the Earth City three, and we in the Human City also have three."</p><p></p><p>"And according to your words, that Little Friend Lu has cultivation on par with the top three on our Human City's battle ranking..."</p><p></p><p>"This time, as long as we let him become one of the three from our Human City participating in the Seven-Colored Crystal Tower competition, won't he be able to naturally join our Human City?"</p><p></p><p>Han Jinlong slapped his palm and chuckled, "That's exactly what the King had in mind!"</p><p></p><p>"However... if you want Little Friend Lu to participate, then one of those three little fellows at the top of our battle ranking will have to withdraw..." Yan Jueyi said meaningfully.</p><p></p><p>Han Jinlong's brow furrowed slightly, waving his hand, "Withdraw one if we have to, who dares to disobey the King's order?"</p><p></p><p>Yan Jueyi shook his head, his gaze turning towards the city, seemingly looking at the battle ranking, and said indifferently, "You should know clearly, those little fellows, especially the three currently ranked at the top, they are fighting for those rankings not just for the honor, but to obtain the spots for the Seven-Colored Crystal Tower, right?"</p><p></p><p>Han Jinlong was silent for a moment, then smiled and said, "So what? We must seize this opportunity to bring Little Friend Lu into our Human City."</p><p></p><p>"As for those three little fellows at the top of the battle ranking, if they are not satisfied, they can go find Little Friend Lu. If Little Friend Lu really loses, the King will just think of another way!"</p><p></p><p>Hearing this, before Yan Jueyi could speak, Han Jinlong suddenly looked embarrassed and continued, "Before that, there is an even more important matter I need to ask the Cane Saint for a favor..."</p><p></p><p>Huh?</p><p></p><p>Yan Jueyi's gaze immediately sharpened, and he eyed Han Jinlong warily! </p><p></p><p>What scheme had this fellow hatched this time?</p><p></p><p>Seeing this, Han Jinlong rubbed his hands and smiled, "Little Friend Lu said that unless the King or the Cane Saint personally come to invite him, he won't participate in the Seven-Colored Crystal Tower. So, will you go?"</p><p></p><p>Ah?</p><p></p><p>Here is the full English translation of the Chinese excerpt:</p><p></p><p>Yan Jueyi paused, his face immediately turning cold. He lightly slapped the table and sternly said, "How dare you! This is a major affair for the human race. Our human race's disciples, like those little fellows on the battle rankings, who doesn't want to participate in the Seven-Colored Jade Tower? Who isn't proud to serve the human race?"</p><p></p><p>"This so-called Lu Xiaoyou's face is too big, actually letting you or me, the two leaders of the human race, go and invite him???"</p><p></p><p>Han Jinlong's face darkened. He knew that Yan Jueyi's expression wouldn't look good, and he helplessly said:</p><p></p><p>"Didn't I tell you before that Lu Xiaoyou is new to the Divine-Demonic Battlefield? Put yourself in his shoes, how can he understand anything when he just arrived? He hasn't even experienced battles with other races, so how can he have a strong sense of belonging to the human race?"</p><p></p><p>"So, you must not be too harsh on the newcomer Lu Xiaoyou."</p><p></p><p>Yan Jueyi paused for a moment and said, "Alright, what you said also makes sense."</p><p></p><p>Han Jinlong nodded in satisfaction and smiled, "So..."</p><p></p><p>Yan Jueyi interrupted, "So you go instead. I still have some matters to attend to in the Underworld City."</p><p></p><p>After saying that, he drained the cup of wine and disappeared.</p><p></p><p>Han Jinlong: "......"</p><p></p><p>It seemed that he had spoken in vain.</p><p></p><p>Han Jinlong knew that Yan Jueyi, this battle-crazed person, must have gone to the Underworld City to spar with Mian Tian and Jiang Wuxin...</p><p></p><p>Sigh, he really didn't want to go find that Lu Xiaoyou. Previously, he had put on a false face, and this time he was afraid he wouldn't be able to hold back and might lose face.</p><p></p><p>Oh well, he had just returned today, he'll go to the Immortal Willow Tavern in a few days.</p><p></p><p>Thinking this, Han Jinlong took out a book and started reading, and soon his breathing became rapid.</p><p></p><p>...........</p><p></p><p>Five days later.</p><p></p><p>At the entrance of the Immortal Willow Tavern, people were coming and going.</p><p></p><p>Suddenly, a burly middle-aged man in golden battle armor appeared in front of the tavern!</p><p></p><p>The middle-aged man seemed to exude an imperial aura, and the air on the entire street seemed to suddenly freeze!</p><p></p><p>Many cultivators felt a sense of something and quickly looked over, seeing that distinctive golden figure, their pupils suddenly constricting!</p><p></p><p>Who did they see?</p><p></p><p>The... Golden Wheel...</p><p></p><p>"Golden Wheel King Lord!!"</p><p></p><p>In the next moment, all the cultivators on this street hurriedly prostrated themselves, their heads touching the ground!</p><p></p><p>They were both fearful and excited in their hearts, after all, this was one of the five lords of the human race!</p><p></p><p>At the same time, they were extremely puzzled, because the two supreme lords of the human race were usually not seen in the human city...</p><p></p><p>Meanwhile, inside the Immortal Willow Tavern, upon hearing the respectful calls outside, everyone's faces froze, and they unanimously stood up from their seats, moving their seats aside, and kneeling down on the ground nervously.</p><p></p><p>The tavern keeper secretly peeked outside, and was directly scared out of his wits, it was really the Golden Wheel King Lord!</p><p></p><p>At this moment, the Golden Wheel King Lord was standing in front of the tavern.</p><p></p><p>What was the Golden Wheel King Lord doing at his tavern?</p><p></p><p>The keeper was terrified, and hurriedly stumbled out, kneeling down at the door, but didn't dare to speak.</p><p></p><p>At this point, the entire street was deathly silent, and Han Jinlong stood there quietly, not uttering a word, just like an emperor descending.</p><p></p><p>From this, one can see that the five lords of the human race have an extremely lofty status among the human race!</p><p></p><p>Han Jinlong's face was expressionless, but at this moment, he slightly raised his head and looked at the tavern, where a figure in blue was standing by the window, also silently looking at him...</p><p></p><p>Han Jinlong gave the figure in blue a friendly smile.</p><p></p><p>Today, he had set aside his identity as a lord and openly come to this Immortal Willow Tavern.</p><p></p><p>It was to give Lu Xiaoyou the proper face, sincerity, and grand occasion!</p>

        <h1>Chapter 528</h1>
        <div class="content">
            <p>Here is the full English translation of the Chinese excerpt:</p><p></p><p>"Haha, good! So you're Huang Xuan?"</p><p></p><p>Song Ren gently placed his hand on Huang Xuan's shoulder and asked.</p><p></p><p>"Yes!" Huang Xuan nodded firmly, looking at the Tianwu Sect steward in front of him, looking at the dozen or so shocked senior apprentices of the Tianwu Sect, looking at the envious gazes of the crowd, and the pride and joy in his parents' eyes...</p><p></p><p>At this moment, Huang Xuan felt a sense of exhilaration that he had never experienced before.</p><p></p><p>He had never been this glorious throughout his life!</p><p></p><p>"Huang Xuan... Hmm! Very good! Huang Xuan, you can go back to your parents first, while I, the steward, will test the rest of the children."</p><p></p><p>Song Ren patted Huang Xuan's shoulder and smiled.</p><p></p><p>"Yes, steward."</p><p></p><p>Huang Xuan bowed slightly and ran to Huang Yulang and Zhang Shuhui amidst many envious gazes.</p><p></p><p>"Old Huang, your son Huang Xuan is really making you proud! My child probably won't have a chance now."</p><p></p><p>"I'm so envious, as they say, when one person succeeds, the whole family prospers. Old Huang, from now on, as we live in this Jixing Town, you must take good care of our two families!"</p><p></p><p>"Judging from the steward's evaluation of Huang Xuan just now, it seems that this Earth Vein is really extraordinary. I've never heard of it before, and the Huang family has finally taken off."</p><p></p><p>Huang Yulang listened to the back-and-forth of the other two clan leaders, his back straight and his mouth smiling widely, feeling very honored!</p><p></p><p>The other two families seemed to be looking up to the Huang family as the leader.</p><p></p><p>All of this was brought about by Xuan!</p><p></p><p>Beside him, Zhang Shuhui affectionately ruffled Huang Xuan's hair, beaming with joy.</p><p></p><p>"Next!"</p><p></p><p>At this time, many more children were eliminated, dejected and retreating, enviously looking towards Huang Xuan.</p><p></p><p>"Vein!"</p><p></p><p>This time, the crystal in Song Ren's hand emitted a light, but the light was dimmer than the one for Huang Xuan.</p><p></p><p>"Not bad, go to the side."</p><p></p><p>Song Ren smiled at the child, but it was not as warm as with Huang Xuan.</p><p></p><p>Then,</p><p></p><p>"Vein!"</p><p></p><p>"Vein!"</p><p></p><p>"Another Vein!"</p><p></p><p>"......"</p><p></p><p>After Huang Xuan, Veins sprouted like bamboo shoots after the rain!</p><p></p><p>Twelve Veins in a row!!</p><p></p><p>The crowd drew in a sharp breath, looking at the twelve children standing in a row.</p><p></p><p>Song Ren was slightly panting. He had not expected that in this Jixing Town, in addition to Huang Xuan's Earth Vein, there would be so many Veins!</p><p></p><p>He had already been pleasantly surprised by the existence of Huang Xuan, and had not expected that more Veins would appear one after another, a total of twelve!</p><p></p><p>This unassuming Jixing Town, the number of Veins appearing, in the Star Luo Empire, far exceeded that of all other cities outside the capital!</p><p></p><p>At the same time, the parents of these twelve children with Veins were all in tears of joy, trembling with excitement!</p><p></p><p>The townspeople were also stunned, never imagining that their Jixing Town would produce so many Veins this time!</p><p></p><p>Until now, they had not yet realized one thing.</p><p></p><p>That is, including Huang Xuan, the thirteen children who were tested to have Veins were all students of the Longevity Academy!</p><p></p><p>But Town Master Cao Yulong and the several clan leaders Huang Yulang had a sharp look in their eyes!</p><p></p><p>Because they realized that all the children with Veins were students of Teacher Lu!</p><p></p><p>Huang Yulang's gaze turned urgent, his heart shocked.</p><p></p><p>Why was it so coincidental?</p><p></p><p>Or was it that all the students recruited by Teacher Lu happened to have Veins?</p><p></p><p>But cultivation does not require Veins, so what was Teacher Lu's purpose in this?</p><p></p><p>Or was it just a coincidence?</p><p></p><p>Thinking of this, Huang Yulang looked towards Ye Xiaoxiao and Han Yue, the last two students of the Longevity Academy who had not been tested.</p><p></p><p>If these two students also tested positive for Veins, then it would not be a coincidence!</p><p></p><p>At this time, the smile on Song Ren's face had not faded, and he looked at the remaining children with a sense of hope, exclaiming excitedly, "Continue the testing!"</p><p></p><p>Here is the full English translation of the Chinese novel excerpt:</p><p></p><p>"Next!"</p><p></p><p>"Next!"</p><p></p><p>"......"</p><p></p><p>Soon, it was Ye Xiaoxiao's turn.</p><p></p><p>Song Ren placed the crystal stone on her forehead, and the silent crystal stone suddenly burst into brilliant light the next moment!</p><p></p><p>This dazzling light was not inferior to the one from Huang Xuan earlier!!</p><p></p><p>"Earth, Earth Martial Vein! Another Earth Martial Vein!!"</p><p></p><p>Song Ren even stammered in his surprise.</p><p></p><p>For a small town to produce one Earth Martial Vein was already extraordinary, but two Earth Martial Veins? What was going on?</p><p></p><p>Song Ren's mind went blank as he looked towards Jixiang Town. What kind of blessed land was this?</p><p></p><p>But he had been here before, and back then, only two ordinary martial veins were detected!</p><p></p><p>This time, not only were there twelve ordinary martial veins, but two Earth Martial Veins had also appeared!!</p><p></p><p>It must be known that even the imperial capital could only boast of one Earth Martial Vein at most!!</p><p></p><p>Crazy, this was driving him crazy!</p><p></p><p>The disciples of the Tian Wu Sect and many of the town's residents were also utterly shocked.</p><p></p><p>Another Earth Martial Vein!</p><p></p><p>Ye Xiaoxiao's parents were extremely excited, clenching their fists tightly, overjoyed and elated!</p><p></p><p>Huang Xuan, however, felt a little jealous, feeling that his spotlight had been stolen by Ye Xiaoxiao.</p><p></p><p>"Child, what is your name? Are you willing to join the Tian Wu Sect? As I said before, with your natural talent, it will not be difficult for you to become a renowned figure in the starry sky, and you may even be able to see a broader world!"</p><p></p><p>Song Ren was so excited that his body was trembling slightly!</p><p></p><p>Earth Martial Vein! Two Earth Martial Veins! </p><p></p><p>Combined with the Earth Martial Vein from the imperial capital, the Tian Wu Sect would definitely have a chance to stand out in the upcoming competition among the young talents of the various countries.</p><p></p><p>And his, Song Ren's, achievements would naturally be elevated within the sect.</p><p></p><p>Ye Xiaoxiao didn't expect to have a martial vein, let alone an Earth Martial Vein, but she really had no interest in this at all!</p><p></p><p>Her dream was to become a free-spirited book cultivator, not to walk the martial path.</p><p></p><p>With this in mind, Ye Xiaoxiao turned her head to look at her excited parents, feeling conflicted, and then gritted her teeth and said:</p><p></p><p>"To the Executor, the Tian Wu Sect is very good, but Xiaoxiao's dream is to be a book cultivator, and I appreciate the Executor's kindness, but I must decline."</p><p></p><p>What?! Declined?!</p><p></p><p>Everyone on the scene was stunned!</p><p></p><p>Song Ren's expression stiffened, and Ye Xiaoxiao's parents were even more anxious.</p><p></p><p>"Xiaoxiao! What are you thinking? Your talent is so good, but instead of joining the Tian Wu Sect, you want to pursue the illusory path of book cultivation? What are you thinking?"</p><p></p><p>Ye Xiaoxiao's mother, Zhong Fang, stomped her foot and scolded, revealing her deep anxiety.</p><p></p><p>Her father, Ye Jun, didn't say anything, just with a stern expression.</p><p></p><p>"Hehe." Song Ren regained his composure and looked at Ye Xiaoxiao: "Xiaoxiao, don't make a decision so quickly, go and communicate with your parents first..."</p><p></p><p>He could not possibly let go of such a good seedling!</p><p></p><p>Earth Martial Vein, such natural talent, if he failed to bring her back to the sect, he would definitely be severely punished! Severely!</p><p></p><p>Although the Star Luo Empire regarded the Tian Wu Sect as the best, there were still other sects. If the news spread and other sects snatched her up, Song Ren would be done for!</p><p></p><p>Ye Xiaoxiao could only bow slightly and hurry towards Ye Jun and Zhong Fang.</p><p></p><p>As soon as Ye Xiaoxiao arrived, Zhong Fang grabbed her hand and, along with Ye Jun, went aside to persuade Ye Xiaoxiao.</p><p></p><p>"Next."</p><p></p><p>Song Ren cleared his throat and called out.</p><p></p><p>Han Yue stepped forward.</p><p></p><p>Song Ren placed the crystal stone on his forehead.</p><p></p><p>Suddenly, the light flashed again, although a little dimmer than Huang Xuan's and Ye Xiaoxiao's, but not much different!</p><p></p><p>Another Earth Martial Vein!!?</p><p></p><p>Song Ren's hand trembled, and the crystal stone fell to the ground, his mouth agape in disbelief.</p>

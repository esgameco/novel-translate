        <h1>Chapter 116</h1>
        <div class="content">
            <p>Here is the full English translation of the Chinese excerpt:</p><p></p><p>BOOM!!!</p><p></p><p>Under this overwhelming pressure, Li Hua and the other two had absolutely no power to resist. üê§üíù‚ùªÔºô≈úÂçÑœÖ–ñ.‚ÑÇ„Ññ–º‚ô§‚ôü</p><p></p><p>They knelt on the ground with a thud, spitting out a mouthful of fresh blood, their faces turning pale and their whole bodies wilting!</p><p></p><p>Their hearts chilled.</p><p></p><p>They never imagined that the unassuming Heavenly Mechanism Pavilion Master was actually a Immortal Venerable...!</p><p></p><p>If they had known this earlier, they would have been more polite just now.</p><p></p><p>No wonder the Yin-Yang Immortal Emperor said to be more polite, there was some reason behind it.</p><p></p><p>Probably the Yin-Yang Immortal Emperor thought that if they dared to cause trouble, they might die here and not be able to return to the Immortal Emperor's Palace...</p><p></p><p>"Hea...Heavenly Mechanism Pavilion Master."</p><p></p><p>Li Hua said with a slightly trembling voice.</p><p></p><p>An Immortal Venerable, his weight is really heavy...</p><p></p><p>Nangong Jing said, "Did this Pavilion Master just hear that someone wanted to level my Heavenly Mechanism Pavilion?"</p><p></p><p>"No, no, it was just a misunderstanding, Heavenly Mechanism Pavilion Master. Just now Li Hua was talking nonsense in a moment of madness, but now Li Hua is much more clear-headed, really!" </p><p></p><p>Li Hua answered somewhat nervously.</p><p></p><p>"That's good then." Nangong Jing nodded and then suddenly withdrew the Immortal Venerable's pressure.</p><p></p><p>Li Hua and the other two immediately heaved a big sigh of relief.</p><p></p><p>"You can go back to the Immortal Emperor's Palace now. Just now Nan Zhen has already explained it clearly to you, it's just that you were too stupid. This Pavilion Master believes that if you tell the Yin-Yang Immortal Emperor the original words, he will definitely understand."</p><p></p><p>Nangong Jing said indifferently, then waved his sleeve and disappeared.</p><p></p><p>"Cough."</p><p></p><p>Kong Nanzen coughed dryly, his face regaining its calmness, as if the flushed and red-faced person just now was not him.</p><p></p><p>"It's a good thing the Pavilion Master didn't hold it against you. Let's go."</p><p></p><p>Kong Nanzen glanced at Li Hua and then left with the other nine Pavilion Elders like an elder brother.</p><p></p><p>Only Li Hua and the other two, whose faces kept changing between black and purple, and a few dumbfounded little servants were left here.</p><p></p><p>Li Hua was furious and bared his teeth at the little servants, scaring them so much that they ran away!</p><p></p><p>"Hmph, how hateful!" </p><p></p><p>Li Hua muttered angrily, naturally not going to bother with a few little servants.</p><p></p><p>"Let's go back to the Immortal Emperor's Palace and report to the Immortal Emperor what happened here. I believe the Immortal Emperor will get justice for us!"</p><p></p><p>Li Hua wiped the blood at the corner of his mouth and disappeared along with the other two middle-aged men, who also looked disheveled.</p><p></p><p>.........</p><p></p><p>As Li Hua and the others were traversing the void, they suddenly saw an old man with a hunchback standing in front of them, blocking their way.</p><p></p><p>The three of them abruptly stopped, their expressions changing slightly.</p><p></p><p>"Who are you?" </p><p></p><p>Li Hua said with an ugly expression.</p><p></p><p>Since coming to this Heavenly Mechanism Pavilion, everywhere has not been smooth. Before, they could just walk around arrogantly.</p><p></p><p>But today, there's another one who dares to block them?</p><p></p><p>"Hehe, Grandpa Turtle is just simply displeased with you and has come to teach you a lesson."</p><p></p><p>The old turtle, with his arms crossed, sneered.</p><p></p><p>Hearing this, Li Hua also laughed, but it was an angry laugh. He asked,</p><p></p><p>"Do you know who we are?"</p><p></p><p>"Grandpa Turtle doesn't care who you are!" </p><p></p><p>The old turtle laughed scornfully, and suddenly disappeared from his spot, only to reappear behind Li Hua and the others!</p><p></p><p>Bang bang bang!</p><p></p><p>In quick succession, three palm strikes, and Li Hua and the others' eyes rolled back as they fainted.</p><p></p><p>Normally, three Immortal King-level experts should not be able to be knocked out so easily, but the old turtle is the number one existence under the Five Great Immortal Realms' Luchengsheng, knocking out three Immortal Kings is a piece of cake for him.</p><p></p><p>"Hehe."</p><p></p><p>The old turtle chuckled mischievously and started to take action.</p><p></p><p>He first stripped the three of them completely naked, then tied them up with ropes.</p><p></p><p>Finally, he grabbed the end of the rope and dragged the unconscious three towards the direction of the Immortal Emperor's Palace, disappearing into the void.</p><p></p><p>.........</p><p></p><p>At the same time, inside the Heavenly Mechanism Pavilion,</p><p></p><p>Nangong Jing waved his hand, producing four wooden tablets engraved with countless talismans. He solemnly floated the wooden tablets in the air.</p><p></p><p>After infusing them with Immortal Spiritual Energy and making them tremble and emit a faint glow, he intoned towards the four wooden tablets...</p><p></p><p>Here is the full English translation of the Chinese excerpt:</p><p></p><p>"Ling Tian Immortal Emperor, Yin Yang Immortal Emperor, Phoenix Nine Immortal Emperor, Wushi Immortal Emperor, Nangong used the lifespan of millions of years to deduce the Ancestral Celestial Realm... the Divine Path... the Abyssal Demonic Clan... at least ten Immortal Emperor-level powerhouses..."</p><p></p><p>Soon, Nangong Mirror had finished explaining the impending great calamity that would befall the Immortal Realm.</p><p></p><p>After a moment, the light of the wooden plaque gradually dimmed and finally turned to dust.</p><p></p><p>Nangong Mirror let out a heavy sigh.</p><p></p><p>He had already made the severity of the situation very clear.</p><p></p><p>Finally, he looked towards the location of the Heavenly Divination Pavilion, the area under the black cloth obscured, lost in thought.</p><p></p><p>...</p><p></p><p>In the Southern Immortal Realm, the Immortal Emperor Palace.</p><p></p><p>When the old turtle cheerfully tossed the three naked bodies down,</p><p></p><p>the high-ranking members of the Immortal Emperor Palace were shocked!</p><p></p><p>What was that?</p><p></p><p>How could Li Hua Immortal King and the other two Immortal Kings be bound by a red rope...</p><p></p><p>But come to think of it, Gill was so small.</p><p></p><p>Some Immortal Kings quickly released their Immortal Qi to catch Li Hua and the others, and at that moment, the old turtle snapped his fingers in the sky above.</p><p></p><p>The three below then woke up.</p><p></p><p>They opened their eyes in a daze and found themselves facing the bewildered high-ranking members of the Immortal Emperor Palace.</p><p></p><p>What happened? Didn't they just encounter an old man?</p><p></p><p>How did they suddenly return to the Immortal Emperor Palace?</p><p></p><p>"Esteemed ones, what is the meaning of this...?" Li Hua said, confused.</p><p></p><p>At the same time, he secretly suspected that something felt off.</p><p></p><p>"Ahem. Immortal King Li Hua, could you please first remove the red ropes on your bodies, and then put on your clothes before speaking." An Immortal King said in a muffled, flustered tone.</p><p></p><p>Exposing oneself was somewhat disrespectful.</p><p></p><p>And they were so small.</p><p></p><p>Ugh!!</p><p></p><p>The three were suddenly shocked, hastily looking down. They were horrified to see themselves naked, tightly bound by red ropes, appearing to have some strange fetish...</p><p></p><p>Even more terrifying to them was the sight of their own slender...</p><p></p><p>The three were immediately overcome with shame and indignation!</p><p></p><p>The next moment, Li Hua erupted with Immortal Qi, but the red ropes, made of some unknown material, did not budge at all, showing no signs of being broken!</p><p></p><p>The Immortal Kings present were alarmed and hurried to help, but no matter what they did, the ropes remained firmly bound.</p><p></p><p>Li Hua felt desperate, shouting, "Quickly, go summon the Celestial Immortal Venerable!"</p><p></p><p>In the end, even the so-called Celestial Immortal Venerable was unable to do anything, saying they could only wait for the Yin Yang Immortal Emperor to return. The three were utterly dejected.</p><p></p><p>Not only were they disgraced, but they would be out of sight for a long time to come.</p><p></p><p>That damned hunchbacked old man! This grudge must be avenged!</p><p></p><p>...</p><p></p><p>After Lu Changsheng saw the images in the Heavenly Divination Mirror in the Heavenly Divination Pavilion, everything seemed to have come to a standstill.</p><p></p><p>Except for time.</p><p></p><p>Time flew by, endless and unstoppable, like a rushing torrent, day and night without pause!</p><p></p><p>In the blink of an eye,</p><p></p><p>five hundred years had passed...</p><p></p><p>During these five hundred years, in the Lingchen Realm, the owner of the Camellia Wine Cellar in Moyu Town, who had been waiting for that gentleman, had already passed away...</p><p></p><p>Those ordinary people who had seen Lu Changsheng had also long since entered the cycle of reincarnation.</p><p></p><p>Within the Qingyun Sect, with the help of the heavenly treasures bestowed by Lu Changsheng, the Ancient Crane Forest had reached the Tribulation Crossing stage at least two thousand years earlier, and Tongxin and Lin Dong had also achieved Divinity Transformation under the influence of those treasures, while Chen Dadao had already reached the Nascent Soul stage.</p><p></p><p>When the teacher-disciple quartet revealed their cultivations, the entire Immortal Cultivation Realm was shocked.</p><p></p><p>Everyone speculated that there must be some supreme treasure, otherwise, such a cultivation speed would be unnatural!</p><p></p><p>But since the Ancient Crane Forest's teacher-disciple quartet had endured for so long, and their cultivations had risen, they naturally had nothing to fear!</p><p></p><p>Another hundred years passed.</p><p></p><p>The Ancient Crane Forest faced the Ascension Tribulation. Under the gaze of countless onlookers, he crossed the rainbow bridge and entered the Ascension Passage.</p><p></p><p>He left behind only a single sentence,</p><p></p><p>"My disciples, your master is going to see the gentleman first, don't be envious."</p>

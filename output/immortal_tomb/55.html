        <h1>Chapter 55</h1>
        <div class="content">
            <p>Here is the full English translation of the Chinese excerpt:</p><p></p><p>"Sir, you've arrived. .o0√óX√ó0o. ‚ûÖÔºô≈úƒ¶·ëåùîÅ.·ëïùï†ùê¶ .o0√óX√ó0o."</p><p></p><p>Zhang Cheng's face broke into a smile as he held the gourd and bowed slightly.</p><p></p><p>Ji Wuqing scrutinized the man in blue robes, her gaze flickering slightly, unable to discern the depth of this person before her...</p><p></p><p>This person in front of her should be a cultivator who has attained the Heavenly Immortal realm or even the early stage of the Tribulation Crossing realm, possessing a precious Qi-concealing treasure.</p><p></p><p>Only cultivators at this stage would be able to conceal their aura to the point where she could not see through them.</p><p></p><p>As for those who have already crossed the Tribulation, that would be impossible.</p><p></p><p>Currently, in the Immortal Cultivation World of Ling Chen, there are only four who have crossed the Tribulation.</p><p></p><p>They are Zhang Youdao from the Carefree Abode in the Western Domain, Jiang Yuan from the Purple Extreme Thunder Peak in the Eastern Domain, Qin Fiaomiao from the Holy Palace of Heavenly Snow in the Northern Domain, and Liu Wuxiu from the Infinite Pavilion in the Southern Domain...</p><p></p><p>As for the other cultivators who are in the early or middle stages of Tribulation Crossing, she has not even considered them worthy of her attention.</p><p></p><p>Lu Changsheng nodded and said, "Go quickly."</p><p></p><p>From beginning to end, he did not even glance at Ji Wuqing.</p><p></p><p>"Yes, please wait a moment, sir." </p><p></p><p>Zhang Cheng heaved a sigh of relief and glanced awkwardly at Ji Wuqing before taking the gourd and heading to the wine cellar.</p><p></p><p>"Hold on, didn't I say earlier that the peach blossom wine is an absolute must-have? Didn't you hear me?"</p><p></p><p>At this moment, Ji Wuqing spoke in a calm tone.</p><p></p><p>Zhang Cheng's body paused, but after taking a deep breath, he resolutely continued on his way!</p><p></p><p>Seeing this, a flash of ruthlessness flickered in Ji Wuqing's eyes, and she was about to take action, but then she heard the man in blue robes speak up calmly, "The mighty Demon Sovereign, surely you wouldn't dare to lay a hand on an ordinary person?"</p><p></p><p>Ji Wuqing's gaze flashed, and she turned to face Lu Changsheng.</p><p></p><p>Lu Changsheng finally also averted his eyes, looking at her indifferently.</p><p></p><p>Time seemed to freeze in that moment.</p><p></p><p>At this moment, although Ji Wuqing's expression remained calm, her heart was greatly shaken!</p><p></p><p>The man in blue robes had actually directly addressed her by her identity!</p><p></p><p>After all, as the Sovereign of the Demon Realm, she had always worn a black veil and rarely appeared in public as the Demon Sovereign, and the number of people in the Immortal Cultivation World of Ling Chen who could recognize her identity could be counted on one hand!</p><p></p><p>How could this be...</p><p></p><p>In just a moment, this man in blue robes had become a mysterious figure in her eyes.</p><p></p><p>The level of danger he posed had also suddenly risen.</p><p></p><p>"Who are you, to know my identity and dare to face me so calmly? You are no ordinary person."</p><p></p><p>Ji Wuqing temporarily pushed the peach blossom wine to the back of her mind, and now all her attention was focused on Lu Changsheng.</p><p></p><p>At this time, some customers wanted to enter the tavern, but were blocked by Lu Changsheng and Ji Wuqing. Seeing the two were not to be trifled with, they quickly turned to leave, but Lu Changsheng stepped aside and came to sit by the window, smiling, "Why don't you try to guess?"</p><p></p><p>Ji Wuqing also walked to the window table and slowly sat down across from Lu Changsheng, but just as her buttocks touched the seat, she abruptly stood up again, looking at Lu Changsheng with disbelief and exclaiming, "Lu...Changsheng?"</p><p></p><p>But Lu Changsheng's expression had changed like the weather, from the gentle smile of earlier to now as cold as an icy blade.</p><p></p><p>A powerful aura that targeted only Ji Wuqing suddenly descended!</p><p></p><p>"Is my name one that you can casually address?"</p><p></p><p>A majestic, boundless voice resounded in Ji Wuqing's mind!</p><p></p><p>Boom!</p><p></p><p>Ji Wuqing's pupils shrank, her knees buckled, and she crashed heavily to the ground, shattering the floor and the chair behind her.</p><p></p><p>The tavern fell silent.</p><p></p><p>The customers looked at Lu Changsheng's side with panic, and one by one they hastily fled the tavern.</p><p></p><p>Soon, the only ones left in the tavern were Lu Changsheng, Ji Wuqing, the terrified waiter, and Zhang Cheng, who had just come out with the gourd and was now frozen in place...</p><p></p><p>Ji Wuqing was crushed by the oppressive aura, her entire body wracked with unbearable pain, her face deathly pale. At this moment, she had no spare attention for anything else.</p><p></p><p>Here is the full English translation of the excerpt from the Chinese novel:</p><p></p><p>These were the only things - a pair of disbelieving, trembling eyes staring at Lu Changsheng.</p><p></p><p>Endless fear was sprouting in his heart.</p><p></p><p>The initial conjecture was gradually being verified at this moment...</p><p></p><p>Lu Changsheng waved his hand, and the gourd in the waiter's hand flew into his own.</p><p></p><p>This utterly ordinary gesture caused the waiter's scalp to tingle.</p><p></p><p>He seemed to have understood why the boss was so respectful towards this gentleman, to the extent of saving peach blossom wine for him every year.</p><p></p><p>He also finally understood why this gentleman's appearance had not changed at all in the past three years.</p><p></p><p>Lu Changsheng took a sip and smiled slightly, "The wine-making skills have improved."</p><p></p><p>Zhang Cheng naturally knew that he was being addressed, so he hurriedly said, "The gentleman is too kind, the most important thing is that you enjoy the wine."</p><p></p><p>Lu Changsheng nodded slightly, placing the gourd on the table while looking at Ji Wuqing.</p><p></p><p>Ji Wuqing instinctively lowered her head and remained silent.</p><p></p><p>Seeing this, Zhang Cheng tugged the waiter's sleeve and left.</p><p></p><p>"I heard you have a way to break open the secret of the immortal tomb?" Lu Changsheng asked with a faint smile.</p><p></p><p>Ji Wuqing naturally did not take this smile at face value, as she had already known that this mysterious man's emotions were capricious.</p><p></p><p>"My lord... I..." Ji Wuqing's voice was slightly trembling.</p><p></p><p>This had never happened before - she had always been the absolute sovereign, but today...</p><p></p><p>Lu Changsheng did not pursue the matter further, but a persimmon appeared in his hand, and he ate it while looking at her, his gaze like that of someone watching a monkey.</p><p></p><p>"For countless ages, the secret of longevity has been passed down in the immortal tomb..." Ji Wuqing said in a low voice.</p><p></p><p>"So?" Lu Changsheng asked.</p><p></p><p>"I... I want to break it open before my ascension..." Ji Wuqing took a light breath and said.</p><p></p><p>She had been suppressing her cultivation to avoid being detected by the Heavenly Dao, because she did not know if she would be able to return to this mortal realm after her ascension. Letting go of such an extraordinary opportunity was unacceptable to her.</p><p></p><p>Telling Zhao Shenyan that her cultivation had reached a bottleneck was, of course, a lie - she wanted to obtain the secrets of the immortal tomb.</p><p></p><p>If she wanted to ascend, the tribulation of ascension would easily come.</p><p></p><p>Lu Changsheng tilted his head and spat out the persimmon seed, saying, "Oh, how do you plan to break it open?"</p><p></p><p>Ji Wuqing's pupils trembled, and then she said with great difficulty,</p><p></p><p>"I have a method to condense the vital energy of all the beings in the mortal realm, and then form a supreme force to forcibly break open the immortal tomb."</p><p></p><p>Lu Changsheng nodded and said, "So you've allied with the Demon Realm and the Demon Beast Realm, planning to wage war on the mortal realm, since war is the fastest way to condense vital energy."</p><p></p><p>Ji Wuqing's heart shook, and she lowered her head.</p><p></p><p>What else could she say?</p><p></p><p>After a moment, Ji Wuqing raised her head and said tremblingly,</p><p></p><p>"There can't be such an existence as you in the mortal realm. Can you tell me, the disappeared tomb in the immortal mountain range..."</p><p></p><p>Lu Changsheng said softly, "What do you think?"</p><p></p><p>Boom!!</p><p></p><p>Ji Wuqing's mouth slightly opened, and her mind was struck like a huge drum!</p><p></p><p>The other party did not deny it, which meant something... She was well aware of it in her heart.</p><p></p><p>It was highly possible that the unfathomable young man in blue robes in front of her was the master of the disappeared tomb!! </p><p></p><p>That also meant he was at least a powerful figure from ten thousand years ago...</p><p></p><p>Ten thousand years, what a concept.</p><p></p><p>The lifespan of a Qi Refining cultivator is about a hundred years.</p><p>The lifespan of a Foundation Establishment cultivator is over two hundred years.</p><p>The lifespan of a Golden Core cultivator is over five hundred years.</p><p>The lifespan of a Nascent Soul cultivator is over a thousand years.</p><p>The lifespan of a Tribulation Transcendence cultivator is only over two thousand years.</p><p></p><p>Compared to this, the implications were truly terrifying.</p>

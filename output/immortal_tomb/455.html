        <h1>Chapter 455</h1>
        <div class="content">
            <p>Here is the full English translation of the Chinese excerpt:</p><p></p><p>"Ye Feng, since Elder Lu has named you specifically, then you will lead the way, and from now on you will reside in the Offering Pavilion to serve at Elder Lu's command... Ah no, Elder Lu, what do you think?"</p><p></p><p>Ye Nan suddenly remembered that he needed Elder Lu Changsheng's approval.</p><p></p><p>"It's all fine." Elder Lu Changsheng nodded indifferently.</p><p></p><p>The elite disciples of the Ye Clan all looked at Ye Feng with envy. </p><p></p><p>Tonight, anyone could see how important the new Offering Pavilion Elder was in the eyes of the Patriarch and the Clan Leader.</p><p></p><p>This little Ye Feng is bound to prosper in the future. As long as he serves the Offering Pavilion Lord well, he will surely receive rewards from the Clan Leader and the Patriarch.</p><p></p><p>Such a good opportunity, the Ye Clan disciples were simply envious to the core.</p><p></p><p>Ye Xunwang was also envious, and he looked at Ye Feng with a sour expression. He also wanted to serve Elder Lu Changsheng, in case he could learn the art of playing the zither.</p><p></p><p>Could it be that the Lord is afraid of him secretly learning the zither skills, so he let Ye Feng follow him?</p><p></p><p>...</p><p></p><p>Under Ye Feng's lead, Elder Lu Changsheng left the banquet.</p><p></p><p>The crowd watched until the figure in blue robes disappeared into the night before turning their gaze away.</p><p></p><p>Immediately afterwards, the Elders and elite disciples all bowed and withdrew, leaving only Ye Zhuiyue, Ye Zhuixing, and Ye Nantian behind.</p><p></p><p>"Hehe." Ye Zhuiyue suddenly laughed, patting Ye Nantian's shoulder and praising, "Well done."</p><p></p><p>Ye Nantian was surprised and flattered, "The Patriarch is too kind."</p><p></p><p>"Brother, with Elder Lu around, I believe the situation of our Ye Clan will improve somewhat in the future." Ye Zhuixing sighed, after all, the value of a peak Immortal Venerable was truly too high.</p><p></p><p>"Hehe, yes, as you said, Elder Lu's strength is clearly that of a capable person."</p><p></p><p>Ye Zhuiyue stroked his beard and smiled.</p><p></p><p>Listening to their conversation, Ye Nantian hesitated, and his expression was soon noticed by Ye Zhuiyue.</p><p></p><p>Ye Zhuiyue frowned and said, "Nantian, do you have something to say?"</p><p></p><p>Ye Nantian pursed his lips and wryly smiled, "Patriarch, Gongzi, please forgive me for speaking bluntly, but Nantian feels that there seems to be an intention to utilize Elder Lu in your conversation... Now that Elder Lu is the Offering Pavilion Elder of our Ye Clan, he is one of our own."</p><p></p><p>Ye Zhuiyue and Ye Zhuixing exchanged a glance, and for a moment they didn't know what to say, they were just having a normal conversation.</p><p></p><p>After a moment, Ye Zhuiyue said in a deep voice:</p><p></p><p>"Nantian, you are too narrow-minded. The Patriarch naturally has no intention of utilizing Elder Lu. As the Offering Pavilion Elder, Elder Lu is not under command or constraint. To put it bluntly, if the Ye Clan ever faces great danger, and Elder Lu, due to having surplus strength, remains a bystander, the Patriarch would not say anything."</p><p></p><p>"No matter how you look at it, Elder Lu does not have the bloodline of the Ye Clan, so it is not realistic for him to fight to the death for the Ye Clan."</p><p></p><p>"The Patriarch's meaning is that as long as he does not fight to the death, it should be reasonable for Elder Lu, as the Offering Pavilion Elder of the Ye Clan, to stand on the Ye Clan's side, right?"</p><p></p><p>Ye Nantian bowed in shame, "Patriarch, it was Nantian's narrow-mindedness."</p><p></p><p>"Hehe." At this time, Ye Zhuixing smiled and said, "To be honest, the invitation for Elder Lu to become the Offering Pavilion Elder is precisely because we value his strength, so why bother thinking too much? As long as Elder Lu is comfortable staying in the Ye Clan, and the people below serve him well, when the Ye Clan is in trouble, how could Elder Lu just stand by and watch?"</p><p></p><p>"People, are all about mutual benefit. If we treat others sincerely, others will surely treat us sincerely in return."</p><p></p><p>Ye Nantian bowed deeply, "Patriarch, Gongzi, Nantian has learned."</p><p></p><p>Ye Zhuiyue looked at Ye Nantian for a long time, then suddenly sighed:</p><p></p><p>"Nantian, you are actually not suited to be the Clan Leader. As the Clan Leader, one should consider any problem from the interests of the entire clan, but you... Hehe."</p><p></p><p>Ye Nantian's face turned slightly pale, and he said with difficulty, "Patriarch, Nantian knows he is wrong."</p><p></p><p>"No, you are not wrong." Ye Zhuiyue patted his shoulder:</p><p></p><p>"What Zhuixing just said was well said, people are all about mutual benefit. Perhaps this sincerity may bring unexpected returns."</p><p></p><p>...</p><p></p><p>The next morning, Lu Changsheng walked out of the Offering Pavilion.</p><p></p><p>Here is the full English translation of the Chinese excerpt:</p><p></p><p>Taking a morning stroll in the cool breeze.</p><p></p><p>Ye Feng closely followed behind Lu Changsheng.</p><p></p><p>"Elder, hello!"</p><p>"Elder, hello!"</p><p>"......"</p><p></p><p>On the path, whenever members of the Ye Clan passed by and saw Lu Changsheng, they would be greatly surprised, then quickly bow 90 degrees to pay their respects, extremely reverential.</p><p></p><p>In response, Lu Changsheng would return a gentle, elder-like smile.</p><p></p><p>Although his appearance was that of a young man, that elder-like smile was very harmonious, not at all out of place, as if it was meant to be that way.</p><p></p><p>And so, in the following period, the news about the Elder of the Ye Clan having a good temperament and character spread among the members of the Ye Clan.</p><p></p><p>Although the Ye Clan members were still respectful towards Lu Changsheng, at least they dared to show smiles.</p><p></p><p>It was just like with Ye Zhuixing of the Cangwu Pavilion. Although he held a high and powerful position as the Pavilion Master, the Ye Clan members were almost never afraid of him. The bold ones, like Ye Feng and the others, even dared to joke with Ye Zhuixing.</p><p></p><p>Lu Changsheng saw that the Ye Clan members, although extremely respectful towards him, were not afraid of him, and he was quite comfortable with this balance.</p><p></p><p>This was good, unlike his own Xiaoyao Sect, where from the Elders down to the disciples, everyone saw him as if they were seeing a ghost, terrified beyond measure, which was quite boring, so Lu Changsheng didn't want to stay in the sect for long.</p><p></p><p>In fact, Lu Changsheng had misunderstood.</p><p></p><p>The main reason was that the people of the Xiaoyao Sect had all witnessed his terrifying might and his ruthless killing, how could they not be afraid?</p><p></p><p>In contrast, in the Ye Clan, who among them truly knew the extent of his thunderous abilities?</p><p></p><p>Even Ye Xunmang did not know much about it.</p><p></p><p>At the same time, following Ye Nantian's announcement, many ancient clans also became aware that the Ye Clan had appointed a new Revered Elder, all secretly surprised!</p><p></p><p>Where did the Ye Clan find such a powerful Immortal Venerable expert? Everyone knew with their eyes closed that the one qualified to be invited by the Ye Clan as their Revered Elder must be at least at the Immortal Venerable realm, and not just any ordinary Immortal Venerable at that.</p><p></p><p>...</p><p></p><p>Cangwu Pavilion.</p><p></p><p>"Pavilion Master, just now, the Hong Clan has summoned us, the Ye Clan, to discuss something... We..."</p><p></p><p>Ye Nantian frowned.</p><p></p><p>"Oh? The Hong Clan has finally made a move." Ye Zhuixing, who had been lazy, now sat up slowly.</p><p></p><p>"Pavilion Master, how should we respond?" Ye Nantian asked.</p><p></p><p>Ye Zhuixing pondered, "Since the Hong Clan has summoned us, the top ancient clans, it means the Hong Clan now has its own stance and is not siding with any particular clan. This is a good thing."</p><p></p><p>Ye Nantian sighed, "Pavilion Master, whether to go or not, Nantian is really having a hard time deciding. If we don't go, won't it make the Hong Clan misunderstand that we are also on the side of the He Clan..."</p><p></p><p>"But if we go... it would mean becoming enemies with the He Clan, and there would be no turning back..."</p><p></p><p>Ye Zhuixing's eyes flickered as he said firmly, "Go, of course we must go. If the Hong Clan is on the side of the He Clan, we would have no chance of winning and should just go with the flow to save our lives. But now that the Hong Clan is taking the lead, we absolutely cannot agree to the He Clan's plan to refine the Myriad World Calamity Body!"</p><p></p><p>Ye Nantian nodded heavily, understanding the Pavilion Master's intentions, which were also his own inner thoughts. The Ye Clan would fight if they could, and would never be unworthy of the heavens and the earth.</p><p></p><p>"Pavilion Master, Nantian understands. Nantian will go call a few Elders to go to the Hong Clan."</p><p></p><p>Ye Nantian bowed slightly and turned to leave.</p><p></p><p>Ye Zhuixing looked at Ye Nantian's retreating back and said, "Nantian, on your way, please also ask Elder Lu if he would like to go. Elder Lu is now our Revered Elder, so we should naturally let those ancient clans see him. Of course, if Elder Lu does not wish to go, then we will respect his wishes. As a Revered Elder, he is not obligated to go, we cannot force him."</p><p></p><p>"Pavilion Master, don't worry, Nantian understands." </p>

            <p>Here is the full English translation of the Chinese excerpt:</p><p></p><p>In the void. 笙咀汳｣6筐Shuﾌx.com笙ｦ澄</p><p></p><p>Lu Changsheng strolled with his hands behind his back, his blue robe fluttering, feeling quite uneasy, like a wanderer in the void.</p><p></p><p>His steps appeared slow, yet countless specks of stars were swiftly passing by on both sides of his body!</p><p></p><p>And these inconspicuous specks of stars were in fact one world after another!</p><p></p><p>Basically the same size as the Lingchen Realm, there were also many as large as Tianzhihen and Linglang Tian, and even as large as the Zutian Divine Realm!</p><p></p><p>Sometimes, there would even be star specks larger than the Zutian Divine Realm passing by Lu Changsheng.</p><p></p><p>Lu Changsheng's gaze flashed quickly over the countless star specks, the blue light in his pupils flickering intensely, captivating to behold.</p><p></p><p>Soon, his eyes brightened, and a faint smile appeared on the corners of his mouth.</p><p></p><p>"I've got it."</p><p></p><p>...</p><p></p><p>Zutian Divine Realm.</p><p></p><p>When Yintiao returned to the Divine Emperor's Palace, he immediately issued various messages and orders, all strictly following Lu Changsheng's instructions.</p><p></p><p>The originally desperate and turbulent Six Great Divine Realms, after being soothed by the Divine Emperor's Palace, had slightly calmed down.</p><p></p><p>The countless powerful figures who had left Mount Miluo, even after returning to their respective places, did not dare to discuss the events of that day, as Yintiao had issued a gag order on them.</p><p></p><p>In fact, even if Yintiao had not issued the gag order, they would not have dared to speak carelessly.</p><p></p><p>Having witnessed that person's terrifying power, who would still dare to talk about it behind their back or spread the word?</p><p></p><p>As for Old Turtle, Chu Lingtiﾄ］ and the others, they had returned to the medical clinic in Yanwu Town.</p><p></p><p>Time passed, and half a year had gone by in the blink of an eye.</p><p></p><p>Half a year was not a long time, in fact, it was extremely short, but at this moment, for Yintiao and the others, it felt exceptionally long and agonizing.</p><p></p><p>Because the spatial rifts were densely distributed, countless spatial fragments were still suspended in the air, flickering, as if they could continue to crack and fall at any moment, with the end of the world seemingly within reach.</p><p></p><p>Extremely insecure.</p><p></p><p>During this period, Yintiao ordered Xingtiﾄ］ to completely destroy the Tianyan Taoist Temple and the Divine King Pavilion led by Ye Wutian.</p><p></p><p>...</p><p></p><p>Mount Miluo had become an absolute forbidden land!</p><p></p><p>No one was allowed to approach it!</p><p></p><p>Including all the monks of the Jinguan Temple, they had been temporarily relocated outside of Mount Miluo to guard it.</p><p></p><p>Just to prevent anyone from approaching the Heavenly Sword!</p><p></p><p>The sword left behind by Senior Lu was currently the only hope for maintaining the stability of the Zutian Divine Realm!</p><p></p><p>...</p><p></p><p>Another half a year passed.</p><p></p><p>It had been a year since Lu Changsheng's departure.</p><p></p><p>Crack, crack, crack...</p><p></p><p>On this day, a faint sound suddenly echoed throughout the Zutian Divine Realm.</p><p></p><p>Countless living beings were startled and quickly looked up at the sky, only to be shocked by the sight.</p><p></p><p>The previously motionless spatial fragments in the sky were now flowing like a river, filling the countless spatial rifts.</p><p></p><p>This, this is...</p><p></p><p>The space was actually being repaired!</p><p></p><p>And at a visible speed!</p><p></p><p>Immediately, countless living beings in the Zutian Divine Realm cheered and wept with joy!</p><p></p><p>Although the masses did not know what had happened, they knew that they would not have to die.</p><p></p><p>...</p><p></p><p>"Divine Emperor, Senior Lu must have returned! We received a message that the space in all parts of the Zutian Divine Realm is starting to be repaired!" </p><p></p><p>In the Divine Emperor's Palace, Xingtiﾄ］ appeared before the sullen and gloomy Yintiao, excitedly reporting.</p><p></p><p>Huh?</p><p></p><p>Yintiao's eyes suddenly widened.</p><p></p><p>He abruptly stood up, grabbing Xingtiﾄ］'s shoulders, and asked excitedly, "Really?"</p><p></p><p>Immediately, he pushed Xingtiﾄ］ aside, closed his eyes, and gently sensed the changes.</p><p></p><p>The next moment, he let out a big sigh of relief, stumbling back to his seat, his expression a mix of joy and sorrow, as if he was both smiling and crying. "Wonderful..."</p><p></p><p>"In that case, it must be Senior Lu who has returned! Xingtiﾄ］, gather all the guardians, prepare to go and visit Senior Lu... Ah."</p><p></p><p>Yintiao's words trailed off as he suddenly realized that he had no idea where that person was.</p><p></p><p>"Divine Emperor, don't worry, Xingtiﾄ］ knows where Senior Lu is."</p><p></p><p>Here is the full English translation of the Chinese excerpt:</p><p></p><p>At this time, Xing Tian smiled meaningfully.</p><p></p><p>[New 29 Book Bar]</p><p></p><p>A year ago, before leaving Mount Milo Xue, he had sent a voice message to ask the old turtle and the others.</p><p></p><p>"Ah? You know? Very good! Get ready, in a few days, we will go there."</p><p></p><p>Yin Yao excitedly waved his claws.</p><p></p><p>Xing Tian's mouth twitched slightly, speechless in his heart.</p><p></p><p>The God Emperor was not like this before.</p><p></p><p>...</p><p></p><p>Mount Milo Xue.</p><p></p><p>Here it was the same, the damaged space continued to repair itself.</p><p></p><p>Jing Guan and the other monks saw this and heaved a long sigh of relief.</p><p></p><p>Clang!</p><p></p><p>Suddenly, the sound of a sword piercing the sky!</p><p></p><p>Jing Guan and the others were stunned and looked over, only to see the long sword that had been suspended here for a year, turning into a beam of light and disappearing...</p><p></p><p>"Very good, the great tribulation has passed, it seems that Senior Lu has returned."</p><p></p><p>Jing Guan clasped his hands together, bowed towards the direction where the sword disappeared, and chanted a Buddhist mantra.</p><p></p><p>The monks like Hui Hai also hurriedly performed the Buddhist ritual.</p><p></p><p>After a moment.</p><p></p><p>Hui Hai suddenly knelt down in front of Jing Guan in the astonished gaze of the other monks, with a look of shame on his face.</p><p></p><p>"Dharma Master, Hui Hai is guilty."</p><p></p><p>Jing Guan's eyes flickered, helped him up, and said, "Hui Hai, you are not guilty. In that situation, the way you thought and acted in your heart was appropriate."</p><p></p><p>Hui Hai, after hearing this, chanted a Buddhist mantra and remained silent, head bowed in shame.</p><p></p><p>He admitted that at that time, he had a greedy thought in his heart.</p><p></p><p>"Hui Hai, today I will give you the position of Dharma Master. Remember to cultivate well, and reach the Spiritual Origin realm as soon as possible, so that you can hold the position of Dharma Master." Jing Guan said calmly.</p><p></p><p>"Dharma Master!"</p><p></p><p>Hui Hai and the other monks were shocked.</p><p></p><p>"No need for many words." Jing Guan waved his hand slightly, then turned and walked away.</p><p></p><p>"This tribulation has led me to a great awakening."</p><p></p><p>"I know what I'm lacking, and I know what I should do."</p><p></p><p>"Hui Hai, the Dharma Master's staff is not with me right now, I'll give it to you next time."</p><p></p><p>As he spoke, Jing Guan's figure disappeared.</p><p></p><p>Leaving the bewildered monks behind.</p><p></p><p>...</p><p></p><p>A few days later.</p><p></p><p>A figure in a blue robe appeared at the entrance of Yanyu Town.</p><p></p><p>Lu Changsheng glanced at the town plaque, and leisurely walked into the town with his hands behind his back.</p><p></p><p>Soon, the familiar calls reached his ears.</p><p></p><p>"Steamed buns, steamed buns..."</p><p>"Fried dough cakes, fried dough cakes..."</p><p></p><p>"Ah, everyone, look, it's Doctor Lu!!"</p><p></p><p>"Ah, ah, ah, Doctor Lu!"</p><p></p><p>The next moment, the townspeople like Luo Gu excitedly surrounded him, almost encircling Lu Changsheng.</p><p></p><p>Lu Changsheng took a step back, sighed inwardly, and waved his hand to stop them: "If you surround me in the corner like last time, then you won't be able to come to my clinic for treatment later. I'll remember whoever blocks me."</p><p></p><p>Hearing this, the townspeople were startled and did not dare to approach him further.</p><p></p><p>They then took turns asking Lu Changsheng where he had been this past year and how he was doing, their words full of concern.</p><p></p><p>After all, the past year had been like the end of the world.</p><p></p><p>Although things had now recovered, the terrifying scenes were still vividly etched in their minds.</p><p></p><p>They still didn't know what had actually happened.</p><p></p><p>Lu Changsheng smiled and made up a few excuses to fend off the curious townspeople, then headed towards the clinic on his own.</p><p></p><p>At the same time, outside Yanyu Town,</p><p></p><p>A group of people appeared in unison.</p><p></p><p>They were Yin Yao the God Emperor, Xing Tian and the Twelve Guardians, as well as the solitary Jing Guan.</p><p></p><p>There were also a few small fry like Yuan Yang Qiu.</p><p></p><p>They all looked at each other in silence!</p><p></p><p>Yuan Yang Qiu and the few elders of his sect were stunned for a moment, then suddenly frightened and knelt down to pay respects, inwardly cursing their bad luck.</p><p></p><p>Coming to Yanyu Town, they had actually directly encountered the big shots of the Ancestral Heavenly Realm.</p><p></p><p>Each of the people in front of them was capable of crushing his Yang Yuan Sect a million times over!</p><p></p><p>But Yin Yao did not pay attention to Yuan Yang Qiu and the others, but looked at Jing Guan with a meaningful smile and said,</p><p></p><p>"Dharma Master Jing Guan, what, have you also come to visit Senior Lu?"</p>

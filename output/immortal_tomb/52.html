        <h1>Chapter 52</h1>
        <div class="content">
            <p>Here is the full English translation of the excerpt from the Chinese novel:</p><p></p><p>In the rear garden of the Lord's Manor in Moyu Town. ‚òÖüíî‚ûÖ‚ùæ·îï–Ω√π·ô≠.ùïîœå‚ìú‚ôô‚òÆ</p><p></p><p>In the pavilion, the old turtle transformed into a human form and sat across from Lu Changsheng. After pouring Lu Changsheng a cup of wine, he tentatively smiled and said, </p><p></p><p>"My lord, when will you return to the Four Directions Immortal Realm?"</p><p></p><p>Lu Changsheng picked up the wine cup, took a light sip, and glanced at him, saying, "You have been with me for quite some time, haven't you understood me yet?"</p><p></p><p>The old turtle let out an embarrassed laugh and sighed, "My lord, the old turtle naturally understands you. You are immortal, and in the past, when you were bored, you would take the old turtle with you to roam the heavens and earth to pass the time. But you don't know, since you went missing, the Immortal Realm has undergone a great upheaval, and those few Immortal Emperors are barely holding on..."</p><p></p><p>Upon hearing this, Lu Changsheng showed no sign of surprise, he simply raised his hand in front of the old turtle and counted with his fingers, indifferently saying, "No, those fellows can still hold on."</p><p></p><p>Seeing this, the old turtle didn't know what to say.</p><p></p><p>"You can calculate how much lifespan they have left."</p><p></p><p>Lu Changsheng took out a jujube and casually tossed one into his mouth.</p><p></p><p>The old turtle's eyes rolled as he said,</p><p></p><p>"The Ling Tian Immortal Emperor of the Eastern Immortal Realm has about 100,000 years of lifespan left, the Feng Jiu Immortal Emperor of the Western Immortal Realm has about 30,000 years left, the Yin Yang Immortal Emperor of the Southern Immortal Realm has about 50,000 years left, the Wu Shi Immortal Emperor of the Northern Immortal Realm has about 60,000 years left... </p><p></p><p>As for the Chang Sheng Immortal Emperor of the Central Immortal Realm... his lifespan is so abundant that it's inexhaustible, hehe!"</p><p></p><p>Bang!</p><p></p><p>Lu Changsheng flicked a jujube pit at the old turtle's head, indifferently saying, "Your boldness has grown, daring to even mock me."</p><p></p><p>"Sss!" The old turtle clutched the large lump on his head, wincing in pain.</p><p></p><p>"So they still have quite a lot of lifespan left, naturally they can still hold on," Lu Changsheng said softly.</p><p></p><p>"Yes, my lord is right, hehe," the old turtle quickly agreed.</p><p></p><p>He just silently mourned for those Immortal Emperors in his heart.</p><p></p><p>Tsk.</p><p></p><p>Lu Changsheng suddenly took out the Abyss Demon Spear and placed it in front of the old turtle, saying, "Keep this demonic artifact for me."</p><p></p><p>The old turtle stared blankly at the Abyss Demon Spear, disbelievingly saying, "My lord, why are you leaving such a piece of trash with me? It's not worthy."</p><p></p><p>The Abyss Demon Spear trembled slightly, feeling like it had just been hit with 10,000 points of damage.</p><p></p><p>"Oh, it's just boring, keep it to play with, wait for its master to come save it."</p><p></p><p>Lu Changsheng finished speaking and walked towards the room, he was a bit sleepy.</p><p></p><p>The old turtle picked up the Abyss Demon Spear with some speechlessness, then gently bent it,</p><p></p><p>Crack...</p><p></p><p>A crack appeared at the bent part of the Abyss Demon Spear.</p><p></p><p>"Your grandpa turtle hasn't even used any force, and it's already trash."</p><p></p><p>The old turtle disdainfully mocked, then tossed the Abyss Demon Spear to the ground, not bothering with it anymore.</p><p></p><p>The Abyss Demon Spear trembled in fear,</p><p>This young master's old servant was also a big shot.</p><p></p><p>At the same time,</p><p></p><p>In the Demon Realm.</p><p></p><p>"Damn it, Zhao Shenyan, you despicable and shameless bastard, I, the King, will definitely avenge the severed tail!!"</p><p></p><p>Lie Teng Snake lay on the bed in the main hall, his face full of murderous intent and resentment.</p><p></p><p>Four Demon Kings ganging up on him, a single Demon King, was simply shameless.</p><p></p><p>After a moment,</p><p></p><p>Lie Teng Snake calmly strode out of the main hall, transforming into a thousand-zhang giant snake and burrowing into a huge hole.</p><p>He needed some time to recover from his injuries.</p><p></p><p>..........</p><p></p><p>Time passed silently, three years had flown by.</p><p></p><p>The elders of Feixing Valley and other sects left in disappointment.</p><p></p><p>Immediately after, the voices mocking the Qingyun Sect in the Eastern Cultivation Realm began to rise.</p><p></p><p>"It's a good thing we didn't spread this matter to the South, West, and North Realms at the time, otherwise our Eastern Cultivation Realm would have been ridiculed."</p><p></p><p>"The current Sect Master of Qingyun Sect is still too inexperienced after all."</p><p></p><p>Here is the full English translation of the Chinese excerpt:</p><p></p><p>In the main hall of the Qingyun Sect.</p><p></p><p>Shen Miaojun sat silently on the high seat, her expression blank, her face slightly pale.</p><p></p><p>The aftereffects of having her soul searched by Jiang Yuan three years ago had not eased up even now, and she feared she would never be able to advance to the Divinity Realm in this lifetime.</p><p></p><p>The incident of her soul being forcibly searched was known only to her, and she had not told anyone about it. She knew that telling anyone would be useless, only adding to her troubles.</p><p></p><p>"Sect Master, as expected, all the sects in the Eastern Domain are now mocking us," the Grand Elder sighed as he looked at the silent Elders.</p><p></p><p>Now they did not even dare to go out and play chess or have tea with their old friends.</p><p></p><p>Shen Miaojun stood up and said indifferently, "Let them mock, there will come a day when they regret it."</p><p></p><p>Gu Helin opened his mouth, then sighed.</p><p></p><p>Just then, Shen Miaojun's eyes flickered, and a talisman appeared in her hand, burning.</p><p></p><p>Immediately, a figure appeared in the hall.</p><p></p><p>"The Patriarch of the Xitong Carefree Abode will ascend to the Tribulation in the third month, and all Nascent Soul and above cultivators are welcome to observe!"</p><p></p><p>Ascend the Tribulation, Tribulation of Ascension?!</p><p></p><p>The Elders in the hall exchanged shocked glances, taking in sharp breaths.</p><p></p><p>"Sect Master, this is wonderful news. The Patriarch of the Carefree Abode ascending the Tribulation will surely sweep through the entire cultivation world, and the other sects will no longer have the time to focus their attention on our Qingyun Sect."</p><p></p><p>Gu Helin stepped forward to soothe.</p><p></p><p>For some reason, he had always felt that there was something off about Shen Miaojun these past three years. As if... something was missing.</p><p></p><p>Just as Shen Miaojun was about to speak, a middle-aged stranger suddenly appeared in the hall.</p><p></p><p>"Patriarch!"</p><p></p><p>Everyone exclaimed in surprise! </p><p></p><p>The Patriarch had come out of seclusion!</p><p></p><p>Could it be that he had successfully advanced to the Divinity Realm?</p><p></p><p>They were shocked, but also felt a sense of reassurance.</p><p></p><p>"The affairs of the sect will be handled by the Grand Elder. Miaojun, come with me to the Western Domain to observe the Tribulation of Ascension."</p><p></p><p>Shen Lingfeng looked at Shen Miaojun and smiled.</p><p></p><p>"Patriarch, I..."</p><p></p><p>Shen Miaojun hesitated.</p><p></p><p>"Hmm?" Shen Lingfeng's gaze turned puzzled, then he swept his eyes over the Elders and said with a smile, "As for the matter of the demonic and evil realms plotting to seize the immortal tomb, I already know about it. No wonder you all are like this. In the future, they will understand that you should just focus on your own cultivation, and not worry about the opinions and words of others."</p><p></p><p>The Elders were stunned, then a warm current flowed through their hearts. They had thought the Patriarch would scold them, but the outcome was different from their expectations.</p><p></p><p>"Patriarch, I will not go to observe the Tribulation of Ascension," Shen Miaojun said hoarsely.</p><p></p><p>Not go?</p><p></p><p>A flicker of puzzlement passed through Shen Lingfeng's eyes as he said in a serious tone, "Miaojun, do you not know how greatly observing the Tribulation of Ascension can benefit cultivators at the Nascent Soul, Divinity, and even Tribulation Realm? This is a rare opportunity that comes once in a lifetime."</p><p></p><p>The Elders were also dumbfounded. Yes, why wouldn't she go?</p><p></p><p>Especially the Grand Elder, who was the second Nascent Soul cultivator in the Qingyun Sect after Shen Miaojun. He was eager to go.</p><p></p><p>Feeling the gazes of the people around her, Shen Miaojun's body began to tremble slightly, and she pressed her lips tightly together.</p><p></p><p>"Hmm?"</p><p></p><p>Just then, as if he had sensed something, Shen Lingfeng's gaze changed slightly. In a flash, he appeared in front of Shen Miaojun, tapping her forehead with his finger.</p><p></p><p>Soon, in the bewildered looks of the Elders, he shouted sternly, "Your spiritual sense is severely damaged, you've actually been soul-searched? Tell me, who was it? I'll tear him apart!"</p>

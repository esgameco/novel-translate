        <h1>Chapter 387</h1>
        <div class="content">
            <p>Here is the full English translation of the Chinese excerpt:</p><p></p><p>In the Great Dao Demon Pagoda.</p><p></p><p>Lu Changsheng, accompanied by Hunhui, headed towards the seventh floor.</p><p></p><p>"The Great Dao Demon Pagoda... Immortal Emperor Changsheng, I must admit, I feel like I've heard of this place before, but I just can't seem to recall it."</p><p></p><p>By Lu Changsheng's side, Hunhui looked around with a frown and said pensively.</p><p></p><p>"This pagoda has its own space, each floor is a different world, it's quite impressive indeed."</p><p></p><p>Lu Changsheng nodded slightly without saying anything.</p><p></p><p>Soon, they arrived at the seventh floor.</p><p></p><p>Just like when Hunhui and Lu Changsheng first arrived, the only thing in front of them was endless darkness, and they couldn't see anything.</p><p></p><p>Until Lu Changsheng waved his fingers in front of Hunhui's eyes, Hunhui finally could see clearly.</p><p></p><p>Hunhui looked at Lu Changsheng with surprise.</p><p></p><p>Lu Changsheng slightly tilted his chin in a certain direction.</p><p></p><p>Hunhui focused his attention and looked over, his pupils immediately constricting as he saw the demonic child seemingly imprisoned in the darkness.</p><p></p><p>...</p><p></p><p>"Big brother, I was wrong."</p><p></p><p>At this moment, the demonic child said weakly and exhaustedly.</p><p></p><p>The demonic child felt like he was about to collapse. During this period, that terrifying voice would suddenly come every half a day, making him wish for death.</p><p></p><p>It can be said that the torment brought by the Great Dao's voice during this period had far exceeded the confinement of countless years before.</p><p></p><p>The demonic child knew that Lu Changsheng had brought someone into the pagoda, and they were now standing in front of him, but he didn't even have the strength to take a look.</p><p></p><p>"Hunhui, what do you think?" </p><p></p><p>Lu Changsheng ignored the demonic child and asked Hunhui, whose expression looked somewhat grave as he observed the demonic child.</p><p></p><p>Hunhui?</p><p></p><p>The demonic child seemed to have heard this name before, and his body moved slightly.</p><p></p><p>Hunhui took a deep breath and shifted his gaze to Lu Changsheng, first looking at him with shock, then asked, "Immortal Emperor Changsheng, where did you get him from?"</p><p></p><p>Lu Changsheng shrugged lightly and said, "I didn't capture him, he was already locked up in this Great Dao Demon Pagoda from the beginning, previously bound by many chains."</p><p></p><p>Hunhui nodded, then solemnly said, "This is a Reincarnation Demonic Child, an extremely evil being."</p><p></p><p>Reincarnation Demonic Child?</p><p></p><p>Lu Changsheng's gaze became slightly puzzled, as he was certain he had never heard of this before.</p><p></p><p>"Mm." Hunhui nodded, his gaze returning to the demonic child, and said, "Immortal Emperor Changsheng may not know, but the Reincarnation Demonic Child is an extremely special and bizarre existence, not human, not beast, not demon, not ghost..."</p><p></p><p>"And the special thing is, while the Reincarnation Demonic Child may not be as long-lived as the Immortal Emperor Changsheng, it is also difficult to kill and destroy."</p><p></p><p>"Oh?" Lu Changsheng was slightly surprised, finally looking at the demonic child seriously.</p><p></p><p>At this moment, the demonic child suddenly found some strength to lift his head and look at Hunhui with a sinister smile, "The Ghost Emperor of the Ghost Realm is indeed an insightful one."</p><p></p><p>Hunhui's brows furrowed, although he was the ruler of the Ghost Realm, he still felt a chill in his heart being looked at by this Reincarnation Demonic Child.</p><p></p><p>"Do you know him?" Lu Changsheng asked the demonic child with interest.</p><p></p><p>The demonic child pondered for a moment and said, "There are few people of significance in this world that I don't know."</p><p></p><p>"Then can you tell me who I am? By rights, with my strength, I should also have some significance, shouldn't I?" Lu Changsheng said softly.</p><p></p><p>The demonic child: "....."</p><p></p><p>Lu Changsheng's expression turned cold: "So you're saying I have no significance?"</p><p></p><p>Before the demonic child could say anything, the Great Dao's voice suddenly exploded in his mind!</p><p></p><p>"Ah!!!"</p><p></p><p>The demonic child let out a miserable howl, even startling the nearby Hunhui.</p><p></p><p>After a moment,</p><p></p><p>The demonic child rolled his eyes and said dazedly, "Big... brother, you're not playing fair."</p><p></p><p>Lu Changsheng observed the demonic child, and indeed, as Hunhui had said, its life force was extremely tenacious.</p><p></p><p>After all, the Great Dao's voice he had just amplified a bit should have been enough to overwhelm the demonic child.</p><p></p><p>But this demonic child, with its thick flesh, Hunhui's words about it being difficult to kill and destroy were not an exaggeration.</p><p></p><p>Lu Changsheng was confident that in the previous...</p><p></p><p>Here is the full English translation of the Chinese excerpt:</p><p></p><p>Under the sound of the Great Dao, any person's mind would directly collapse.</p><p></p><p>At this time, Hunhui sighed, "The one who could suppress the Reincarnation Demon Child in this tower must also be extremely powerful. I estimate that it is because he could not kill this Reincarnation Demon Child that he resorted to this strategy."</p><p></p><p>Without Hunhui saying it, Lu Changsheng also guessed as much.</p><p></p><p>"Hehe, Hunhui, you are truly worthy of being the Hunhui Emperor, your vision is indeed sharp. That person actually just couldn't kill me, so he could only first suppress me in this Great Dao Demon-Subduing Tower..." The Demon Child shook his head mockingly.</p><p></p><p>Lu Changsheng's eyes narrowed slightly, "Haven't you suffered enough?"</p><p></p><p>The Demon Child immediately suppressed his expression and fell silent.</p><p></p><p>Hunhui looked at Lu Changsheng, transmitting a grave message, "Immortal Emperor Changsheng, this Demon Head cannot be released from the Great Dao Demon-Subduing Tower. If he is let out, it will be a disaster for all living beings..."</p><p></p><p>Hunhui had an impression that a very long time ago, the order of the Hunhui Realm was in great chaos, and the number of tribes he killed was even more exaggerated than this time!</p><p></p><p>The reason was this Reincarnation Demon Child, who was addicted to killing and crazily slaughtered the Great World, harvesting one after another.</p><p></p><p>At that time, it was a disaster, but later it suddenly stopped, and Hunhui thought the Demon Child had some problem, but it turned out he had been suppressed by someone.</p><p></p><p>"Hunhui! Don't think that just because you're transmitting a message, I don't know what you mean! It's none of your business!!"</p><p></p><p>Suddenly, the Demon Child stared at Hunhui and roared fiercely, baring his teeth.</p><p></p><p>Hunhui was even shocked back half a step by this sudden scene. Noticing that Lu Changsheng was present, Hunhui couldn't help but be annoyed and shouted:</p><p></p><p>"Reincarnation Demon Child! Do you think you're still the same as before? Now you're just a prisoner, your strength has greatly diminished!"</p><p></p><p>With that, he waved his sleeve and slapped him.</p><p></p><p>The Demon Child's head was slapped 360 degrees into a frenzy, but his neck did not break, and it finally stopped and looked at Hunhui disdainfully, "If you have the ability, then kill me."</p><p></p><p>Hunhui paused, how could he kill him?</p><p></p><p>Now, what had come was just a relatively strong avatar, and even if the main body came, it was estimated that he couldn't kill this thing.</p><p></p><p>Hunhui simply didn't say anything.</p><p></p><p>The pensive Lu Changsheng suddenly crossed his fingers into a sword and slashed towards the Demon Child.</p><p></p><p>Instantly, a terrifying sword qi split the Demon Child into countless fragments!!</p><p></p><p>However, the next moment, these fragments slowly combined and reconstituted into the Demon Child.</p><p></p><p>Hunhui's eyes were grave, the Reincarnation Demon Child was indeed difficult to kill and destroy...</p><p></p><p>"Big shot, your sword dao is very strong, and although I am now bound by you and cannot defeat you, to extinguish me, you still lack a bit..." The Demon Child said arrogantly.</p><p></p><p>Lu Changsheng was not angry at all, but instead his eyes revealed interest, and without further ado, he turned and left the Great Dao Demon-Subduing Tower with Hunhui.</p><p></p><p>At the same time, outside the Great Dao Demon-Subduing Tower, several cultivators were looking at the Dao Glazed Tower with greedy and shocked expressions.</p><p></p><p>"This... This looks so much like the Seven-Colored Glazed Tower??"</p><p></p><p>"This must be the Seven-Colored Glazed Tower, but why would it appear in our human race's territory, and even in our Crimson Yang Palace's domain?"</p><p></p><p>"Since it has been encountered by our Crimson Yang Palace, it means that it is a great opportunity for our sect. Just to be safe, I have already sent a message to the Patriarch and the Elders, and they are rushing over!"</p><p></p><p>"But... This is the Seven-Colored Glazed Tower that even the peak sects covet, can our Crimson Yang Palace swallow it?"</p><p></p><p>"Never mind that! Wait for the Patriarch to arrive, let him make the decision!"</p><p></p><p>"Mm!"</p>

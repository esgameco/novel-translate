        <h1>Chapter 254</h1>
        <div class="content">
            <p>Here is the full English translation of the Chinese excerpt:</p><p></p><p>"Master, you must help us find our place!" </p><p></p><p>At this time, the old turtle looked at Lu Changsheng with pleading eyes. üòæüê∫‚ùªÔºôùìà‚ìó·ëåùïè.ùî†ÔΩèùïÑ‡µ†‚úå</p><p></p><p>Having been chased by those fellows for so long, even the toughest person would not be able to endure it. </p><p></p><p>After all, the old turtle could not swallow this grievance.</p><p></p><p>Hearing this, Chu LingtiƒÅn and the others perked up. Although... but... however, if the Immortal Emperor Changsheng were to intervene, it would certainly be excellent!</p><p></p><p>They had already witnessed the unfathomable depths of Immortal Emperor Changsheng before.</p><p></p><p>If Immortal Emperor Changsheng were to intervene, Ye Wutian would definitely not be so easy to deal with them.</p><p></p><p>Lu Changsheng smiled leisurely: "Do you know why those people suddenly stopped their pursuit of you?"</p><p></p><p>The group was startled, as they had not mentioned this matter to Immortal Emperor Changsheng before. How could he know about it? But thinking of his mysteriousness, they felt at ease.</p><p></p><p>It seems that as long as Immortal Emperor Changsheng wants to know about something in the world, it would not be difficult.</p><p></p><p>Hmm, basic operation.</p><p></p><p>Feng Jiu pondered, "Could it be that something major has happened at Ye Wutian's Shenwang Palace? Otherwise, how could they abandon the pursuit of us, knowing that it would be even more difficult to find us next time."</p><p></p><p>"Mm..." the others nodded in agreement.</p><p></p><p>"It's not that something has happened at their Shenwan Palace, but rather an event that has had a significant impact on the entire Ancestral Heaven Spiritual Realm." Lu Changsheng said calmly.</p><p></p><p>What?!</p><p></p><p>The old turtle and the others were shocked. How could they not know about this? Had their information been so cut off?</p><p></p><p>At the same time, Tongxin also perked up his ears.</p><p></p><p>"You have been in the Ancestral Heaven Spiritual Realm for some time, I'm sure you've heard of a certain person?" Lu Changsheng said as he poured himself a cup of tea. "His Dharma name is Jinguan."</p><p></p><p>Tongxin's brow suddenly furrowed! Jinguan... wasn't that the name of the old monk who came to the medical clinic to treat his heart illness recently?</p><p></p><p>Thinking of this, he tilted his head to glance at the crutch leaning beside him.</p><p></p><p>...</p><p></p><p>Jinguan???</p><p></p><p>Chu LingtiƒÅn and the others, however, had a startled look in their eyes. They had of course heard of the great name of Dharma Master Jinguan, the number one Buddhist cultivator in the Ancestral Heaven Spiritual Realm, to the extent that even the Ancestral Heaven Divine Emperor had to show him some respect.</p><p></p><p>But what does the retreat of the Shenwan Palace have to do with Dharma Master Jinguan?</p><p></p><p>Lu Changsheng shrugged his shoulders and said indifferently, "He's dead."</p><p></p><p>Ah?</p><p></p><p>Tongxin opened his mouth, dumbfounded. That old monk just died like that? He felt puzzled and sighed.</p><p></p><p>As for the old turtle, he just frowned slightly, while Chu LingtiƒÅn and the others were stunned, their minds reeling.</p><p></p><p>Dharma Master Jinguan has passed away?</p><p></p><p>The passing of a generation of Buddhist cultivators, this news was truly earth-shattering for them.</p><p></p><p>For a moment, they were left speechless, not knowing what to say or what to ask.</p><p></p><p>"In the near future, Tianyin Monastery will hold a memorial ceremony for Jinguan. The top echelons of the major powers in the Ancestral Heaven Spiritual Realm should all attend, so..." Lu Changsheng said softly and slowly.</p><p></p><p>The old turtle and the others suddenly understood.</p><p></p><p>That's why the Shenwan Palace has stopped pursuing them.</p><p></p><p>After all, among those who were chasing them, aside from that highly influential Lin Chuan Sword Wielder, the majority were also high-ranking members of the Shenwan Palace.</p><p></p><p>After a moment of silence.</p><p></p><p>Lu Changsheng looked at the pensive group and said, "Weren't you all planning to go to the Divine Emperor Palace before?"</p><p></p><p>The old turtle and Chu LingtiƒÅn nodded awkwardly.</p><p></p><p>But now, they no longer need to go.</p><p></p><p>Lu Changsheng smiled faintly, "Among you, LingtiƒÅn and Yinyang have decent aptitudes. If you went to the Divine Emperor Palace, they might even give you a position as a Divine King."</p><p></p><p>Hearing this, Chu LingtiƒÅn and Gu Yinyang were delighted, while Shi Wushi looked quite displeased as he glared at Gu Yinyang.</p><p></p><p>That Yinyang weirdo could be better than him?</p><p></p><p>Of course, he didn't dare to argue with Immortal Emperor Changsheng.</p><p></p><p>Feng Jiu, on the other hand, was indifferent.</p><p></p><p>"But you're thinking too simply." Lu Changsheng interrupted the group's fantasies.</p><p></p><p>"Ye Wutian recalling the pursuers is one thing, but him being certain that you would go is another. I can assure you, he has already set up everything at the Divine Emperor Palace."</p><p></p><p>"And there... you will only be walking into a trap."</p><p></p><p>The faces of the old turtle and the others stiffened.</p><p></p><p>Here is the full English translation of the Chinese excerpt:</p><p></p><p>In the midst of their escape, they had no time to ponder too much.</p><p></p><p>Now, upon closer reflection, it was highly likely.</p><p></p><p>Fortunately, they encountered the Master (the Immortal Emperor of Longevity).</p><p></p><p>...</p><p></p><p>Lu Changsheng took a sip of tea, his gaze profound.</p><p></p><p>It could be said that the grand ceremony of praise held in the Ancestral Heavenly Realm, where the top powers gathered, was something he had orchestrated.</p><p></p><p>Not that he had any intention of exploiting Mirror Observation, it was just mutually beneficial.</p><p></p><p>What he had said to Mirror Observation was true - Mirror Observation wanted to break through the tribulation of the Ninth World and attain the Buddha Body, and the only way was to die in the process.</p><p></p><p>He knew that Mirror Observation would eventually awaken.</p><p>And he, he had only greatly accelerated Mirror Observation's process of dying.</p><p></p><p>The reason he came to open a medical clinic in the Ancestral Heavenly Realm was that his memories had opened up a bit more.</p><p></p><p>Even in this Ancestral Heavenly Realm, there were those who plotted against him.</p><p></p><p>At first, Lu Changsheng didn't expect that even in the Ancestral Heavens, his enemies would be scattered across myriad worlds.</p><p></p><p>Those mysterious figures indeed possessed some strength, with their footprints found in myriad worlds...</p><p></p><p>He had originally planned to just open the medical clinic first, and then gradually advance.</p><p></p><p>But Mirror Observation's appearance had changed his plans, truly a case of plans failing to keep up with changes.</p><p></p><p>At Mirror Observation's grand ceremony of praise, all the peak experts of the Ancestral Heavens would gather.</p><p></p><p>At that time, he would be able to identify them at a glance, and then take them all down, not letting a single one escape.</p><p></p><p>It's just that being a bit rough at Mirror Observation's ceremony of praise, he felt slightly embarrassed...</p><p></p><p>After all, white on white, it felt a bit improper.</p><p></p><p>Thinking of this, Lu Changsheng glanced at Little Tong, who was diligently studying medical books behind the counter, his gaze flickering.</p><p></p><p>"Master, so what should we do?" the old turtle asked.</p><p></p><p>Lu Changsheng snapped out of his thoughts: "What do you mean, what to do?"</p><p></p><p>"Ahem, wasn't it that you were going to help us regain our footing? But now, the Dharma Master Mirror Observation's ceremony of praise is imminent. Should we wait until after the ceremony is over before causing trouble for Ye Wutian?" the old turtle asked with a forced smile.</p><p></p><p>He really didn't want to wait at all!</p><p></p><p>As for Chu Lingian and the others, they secretly nodded, thinking it would be more stable to wait until after the Dharma Master Mirror Observation's ceremony of praise before causing trouble for the Divine King Pavilion.</p><p></p><p>After all, there would be so many big shots at that ceremony, even the Ancestral Heavenly Emperor would be there.</p><p></p><p>If anything unexpected happened to the Immortal Emperor of Longevity, they would feel deeply guilty.</p><p></p><p>A faint, cool smile appeared on Lu Changsheng's face. "No need to wait, we'll act during the ceremony of praise."</p><p></p><p>Huh? Play it this intensely?</p><p></p><p>The group was stunned.</p><p></p><p>The old turtle was overjoyed! </p><p></p><p>He had been with Lu Changsheng the longest, and knew very well how powerful his master was. Lu Changsheng never did anything he wasn't confident about, so he had no worries at all!</p><p></p><p>"Immortal Emperor of Longevity, it's better to wait until after the ceremony of praise, right? You... you..." Chu Lingian looked at Lu Changsheng worriedly, stammering.</p><p></p><p>Phoenix Nine, Ancient Yin-Yang, and Shi Wushi were also concerned in their hearts.</p><p></p><p>Lu Changsheng smoothed his sleeves and looked at them with a slight frown. "Are you looking down on me?"</p><p></p><p>"No no no no no!" The four hurriedly waved their hands.</p><p></p><p>"How dare we underestimate the Immortal Emperor of Longevity... Immortal Emperor, you've misunderstood us!"</p><p></p><p>Lu Changsheng couldn't be bothered with them, and stood up, saying, "Tongxin, you and Little Tong stay at the medical clinic for the time being, I'm going out for a bit."</p><p></p><p>"Ah, okay, Master!" </p><p>"Yes!"</p><p></p><p>Tongxin and Little Tong quickly stood up and bowed in response.</p><p></p><p>Seeing this, Lu Changsheng nodded slightly, and a cane leaning nearby flew into his hand, then he walked out.</p><p></p><p>"Master, we haven't even had a chance to sit down properly yet, where are you going?" the old turtle hurriedly stood up, asking in bewilderment.</p><p></p><p>Chu Lingian and the others also stood up, their pupils constricting, could it be...?</p><p></p><p>"Oh." Lu Changsheng paused, then turned back, sighing, "I was originally going to find you a place, but since you don't want to go, then forget it..."</p><p></p><p>The old turtle's expression changed, his heart filled with joy, and he put on a fawning smile, going over to tug at Lu Changsheng's sleeve and nodding obsequiously: "Master, let's go, let's go! Old turtle was just momentarily confused, my brain couldn't keep up."</p><p></p><p>Lu Changsheng disdainfully shook off his hand, indifferently saying, "Then what are you still waiting for? Go."</p><p></p><p>"Going, going, going!" The old turtle and Chu Lingian's group hurriedly went out the door.</p>

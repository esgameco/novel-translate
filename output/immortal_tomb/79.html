        <h1>Chapter 79</h1>
        <div class="content">
            <p>Here is the full English translation of the Chinese excerpt:</p><p></p><p>The Meiyu Trade Association is the largest trade association in the Western Regions. The teleportation array of the Tianrun Trade Association in the Eastern Regions is connected and cooperates with Meiyu, so it can be said that the four major trade associations of the four domains of the Spiritual Dust Realm all have cooperation. After all, just the teleportation array is a very considerable profit.</p><p></p><p>As soon as Lu Changsheng and the others came out of the Meiyu Trade Association, many cultivators at the Refining Qi and Foundation Establishment stages surrounded them!</p><p></p><p>"Senior predecessors, you have come to the Western Regions to witness the Ascension Tribulation. Now there are still two months before the Patriarch of the Xiaoyao Sect undergoes the tribulation. Would you like me to take you on a tour? I am a native of the Western Regions and am very familiar with everything here!"</p><p></p><p>"Senior, I'm known as the 'All-Knowing of the Western Regions', am I not better than him? Choose me, choose me!"</p><p></p><p>"Senior... I still have an aged mother at home, I..."</p><p></p><p>"Shut up, little black guy, you always say the same thing, trying to deceive people. Can't you come up with something new? We've all cultivated immortality, when do we still have connections with the mundane world."</p><p></p><p>The junior cultivators were eager, chattering noisily, pushing and shoving one another.</p><p></p><p>Seeing this, Gu Helin felt slightly embarrassed, and sighed inwardly that the ascension tribulation of a great cultivator could actually trigger such an economic boom, a wave of scrambling for spirit stones.</p><p></p><p>"Uh, sir, what do you think?" Gu Helin looked over at Lu Changsheng, unable to make the decision himself.</p><p></p><p>If the Patriarch Turtle could speak, Gu Helin knew that these junior cultivators would have long been driven away by him.</p><p></p><p>Lu Changsheng softly said, "It's all fine."</p><p></p><p>Hearing this, Gu Helin respectfully nodded, then looked at a thin, dark-skinned cultivator among the crowd and smiled, "Little black guy, come out, it's you."</p><p></p><p>"Uh..." The crowd of cultivators were stunned, then glared hatefully at the little black guy, quickly bowing and retreating.</p><p></p><p>Since the senior predecessors had chosen, they had no choice but to obey, daring not to cause any trouble.</p><p></p><p>The little black guy pointed at himself excitedly, "Senior, can I really?"</p><p></p><p>Gu Helin smiled, "Of course you can. We are indeed not very familiar with the Western Regions, so let you lead the way."</p><p></p><p>He then handed over a mid-grade spirit stone.</p><p></p><p>The little black guy was stunned, trembling as he accepted it. He had been doing odd jobs outside the Meiyu Trade Association for two and a half years, but this was the most spirit stones he had ever received. "Senior, isn't this too much? Little black guy can't bear it."</p><p></p><p>Gu Helin smiled, "It's fine, as long as you guide and introduce the Western Regions well for the sir, the spirit stones won't be lacking for you!"</p><p></p><p>"Sir?" Hearing this, the little black guy instinctively looked at the leading Lu Changsheng, quickly cupping his hands and greeting, "Greetings, sir!"</p><p></p><p>...</p><p></p><p>"Sir, senior predecessors, we are currently in the southern part of the Western Regions, at the Meiyu Trade Association. The Xiaoyao Sect is in the central part of the Western Regions. If we travel by spirit boat at full speed, we can arrive in ten to fifteen days."</p><p></p><p>The little black guy walked beside them, nodding and bowing as he introduced, his expression full of excitement, clearly the mid-grade spirit stone had given him great motivation!</p><p></p><p>Along the way, Old Turtle wanted to chat with the little black guy a few words, but alas, he was almost going crazy.</p><p></p><p>Chu Xiran, on the other hand, had been quietly standing by the side, not even bothering to say a word.</p><p></p><p>"Hehe, little black guy, I suppose the sir must be tired now. Do you know if the Meiyu Trade Association has any suitable resting places? Remember, it should be quiet."</p><p></p><p>Gu Helin said with a smile.</p><p></p><p>"Of course there is! For quiet places, it must be the Lateautumn Residence. Senior predecessors, follow little black guy."</p><p></p><p>The little black guy performed a salute, then bounced and skipped as he led the way, looking like a happy chicken.</p><p></p><p>Gu Helin's eyes lit up. Having a local guide was indeed more convenient, then he looked at Lu Changsheng.</p><p></p><p>"Then let's go to the Lateautumn Residence. As usual, we'll rest there for two days, and then go to the Xiaoyao Sect."</p><p></p><p>Here is the full English translation of the Chinese excerpt:</p><p></p><p>"Lü Changsheng smiled faintly," said Lü Changsheng.</p><p></p><p>New 99 Books Bar → 99shu.com</p><p></p><p>.........</p><p></p><p>Two days later.</p><p></p><p>"Little Black, you've performed quite well these past two days, so here, have some more," Ancient Crane Forest said casually as he pulled out a low-grade spirit stone and handed it over, chuckling.</p><p></p><p>"Thank you, senior predecessors!" </p><p></p><p>Little Black happily stored the spirit stone in his waist storage bag. To be honest, he hadn't really done much these past two days, just following the old man with the hunchback, who seemed to be mute, around the kiln as the white-bearded elder had instructed.</p><p></p><p>These spirit stones came so easily, truly the generosity of the big shots. </p><p></p><p>One year without opening, three years of feasting when opened.</p><p></p><p>In a flash, the spiritual boat vanished into the distance under Little Black's reverent gaze.</p><p></p><p>.........</p><p></p><p>Twelve days later.</p><p></p><p>Lü Changsheng and the others arrived at the center of the Western Regions aboard the spiritual boat, and the group leisurely made their way towards the Carefree Courtyard.</p><p></p><p>Along the way, they could see all kinds of spiritual boats and flying spiritual tools soaring through the sky, all heading towards the Carefree Courtyard, demonstrating the impact of the Carefree Courtyard's Ancestor's ascension tribulation.</p><p></p><p>And on this journey, they did not encounter any unexpected trouble that would provoke Lü Changsheng and the others.</p><p></p><p>Earlier, after the old turtle's mouth was unsealed, he had started rambling on and on endlessly, so Lü Changsheng had helplessly sealed his mouth again for another two and a half months.</p><p></p><p>The old turtle had then collapsed in tears, bitterly pleading, but Lü Changsheng remained unmoved.</p><p></p><p>On this day, the lightning tribulation that Ancient Crane Forest had been driven away from at the Heavenly Circulation Trade Association descended upon him once again.</p><p></p><p>Soon, he successfully weathered the lightning tribulation and advanced to the middle stage of the Nascent Soul realm.</p><p></p><p>If it weren't for that nameless tavern's Cyan Sea Immortal Celestial Liquor that day, he would have needed at least a century to break through to the middle stage.</p><p></p><p>During the tribulation, quite a few cultivators with malicious intentions came to observe, </p><p></p><p>but they just happened to run into the old turtle, who was already in a foul mood.</p><p></p><p>The old turtle simply slapped them to death without leaving a trace.</p><p></p><p>Lü Changsheng and the others were not in a hurry, yet time passed quickly.</p><p></p><p>In the blink of an eye, two months had gone by.</p><p></p><p>Today was the day of the ascension tribulation, and the weather... well, it was clear.</p><p></p><p>Outside the Carefree Courtyard.</p><p></p><p>In the center stood an extremely tall jade-like stone platform.</p><p></p><p>Surrounding the stone platform, densely packed cultivators sat in meditation, with the twenty-odd figures in the innermost circle being cultivators in the tribulation stage from various domains.</p><p></p><p>Farther out were over a hundred Transcendent Immortal Lords, including the Ancestor of the Azure Cloud Sect, Shen Jingtao, and the Ancestor of the Heavenly Circulation Trade Association.</p><p></p><p>Beyond them were thousands of Nascent Soul Patriarchs, including the Azure Cloud Sect's Grand Elder.</p><p></p><p>The outermost layer consisted of a vast number of cultivators, who were far from the Nascent Soul realm and had not been invited, but had come on their own to observe from a distance. Among them were mostly Gold Core cultivators and a few at the peak of the Qi Condensation realm or Foundation Establishment realm, but not a single Qi Refining cultivator could be seen.</p><p></p><p>"Look, who are those four people walking straight towards the inner circle? Heavens!"</p><p></p><p>"I've never seen them before... That young man in blue seems to be the leader, and that female cultivator is quite beautiful, hehe."</p><p></p><p>"Ridiculous, fellow Daoists, can we not focus on such trivial matters? We cultivators have seen all kinds of storms and waves, mere female beauty is nothing. Although, she does seem quite lovely, even surpassing the Sect Master of the Qin Sect!"</p><p></p><p>"I recognize that white-bearded elder, he seems to be Venerable Ancient Crane Forest from our Eastern Domain Azure Cloud Sect."</p><p></p><p>"Ah, the one with exceptional pill-refining skills? I've heard of him."</p><p></p><p>"........"</p><p></p><p>The movement of Lü Changsheng and the others was quite conspicuous in the current scene, quickly drawing the attention of many Nascent Soul, Transcendent Immortal, and tribulation stage cultivators!</p>

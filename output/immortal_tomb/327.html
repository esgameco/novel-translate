        <h1>Chapter 327</h1>
        <div class="content">
            <p>Here is the full English translation of the Chinese excerpt:</p><p></p><p>"Cough, cough, Senior Turtle, I must have been mistaken. |!¬§*&#039;~``~&#039;*¬§!| Ôºñ‚ùæùî∞ƒßùìæx.ùïî‚ìÑ‚ìú |!¬§*&#039;~``~&#039;*¬§!|" </p><p></p><p>Li Shuyan cleared his throat and changed the direction of the flying chariot.</p><p></p><p>The flying chariot of the shooting star suddenly halted, then turned around and soared towards the opposite void.</p><p></p><p>The old turtle glanced at Li Shuyan, then turned his head and smiled cheerfully: "Master, according to this route map, the Battlefield of Gods and Demons is truly the farthest place we have traveled. If all goes well, it will take us about ten thousand years to reach the Battlefield of Gods and Demons."</p><p></p><p>In the flying chariot, Lu Changsheng leaned back and closed his eyes, saying, "Ten thousand years, so be it. There's no hurry."</p><p></p><p>"Yes." </p><p></p><p>The old turtle and Li Shuyan quickly responded.</p><p></p><p>Seeing that Lu Changsheng had rested, the old turtle got up and lowered the curtain, then sat back in his seat, smiling at Li Shuyan.</p><p></p><p>Li Shuyan felt puzzled and said hesitantly, "Senior Turtle, do you have any other instructions?"</p><p></p><p>"Hehe, Shuyan, where did you and the master go during the previous period, and what did you do?" The old turtle finally had time to ask curiously.</p><p></p><p>"Oh, oh." Li Shuyan nodded in realization, then glanced at the countless stars in the void and replied, "Recently, I went with the master to a place called the Eternal Cosmos Realm..."</p><p></p><p>Quickly, Li Shuyan detailed everything that had happened in the Eternal Cosmos Realm to the old turtle.</p><p></p><p>The old turtle nodded from time to time, and was also somewhat shaken. The Eight Ancient Clans, the Divine Element, the Divine Yang, the Divine Storehouse, the Divine Dao?</p><p></p><p>Li Shuyan is now in the middle stage of the Divine Yang realm, and he can easily control himself. So what realm is he in now? The Divine Storehouse or the Divine Dao?</p><p></p><p>"Senior Turtle, may I ask, what realm have you reached? The Divine Storehouse or the Divine Dao?" Sure enough, Li Shuyan couldn't help but ask.</p><p></p><p>Hearing this, the old turtle frowned slightly. Based on the distinctions between the Divine Yang, Divine Storehouse, and Divine Dao that Li Shuyan had just mentioned, he found that none of them matched his own situation.</p><p></p><p>Moreover, he had only felt that he had become much stronger before, but he had never encountered anything specific like "one brilliant sun, two brilliant suns" and so on.</p><p></p><p>"Uh, I don't know," the old turtle said awkwardly.</p><p></p><p>Don't know?</p><p></p><p>Li Shuyan looked at the old turtle suspiciously, but didn't pursue the matter. He guessed that the old turtle should be at the middle stage of the Divine Storehouse or the Divine Dao.</p><p></p><p>Otherwise, he wouldn't have felt a sense of difficulty in resisting the old turtle.</p><p></p><p>Now that he has reached the middle stage of the Divine Yang realm, and has also cultivated the Myriad Forging Flame Technique bestowed by the master, he should not be afraid of a cultivator at the initial stage of the Divine Storehouse realm.</p><p></p><p>Moreover, he has not yet fully comprehended the Myriad Forging Flame Technique, otherwise he would be even more powerful. This body cultivation technique bestowed by the master seems to have been prepared for him to fight beyond his level.</p><p></p><p>"Okay, Senior Turtle, a thousand years is a bit long, so I'll start cultivating first."</p><p></p><p>Li Shuyan said and immediately entered a state of cultivation. Seeing this, the old turtle stretched out his hand, wanting to say something, but thought about it and decided not to.</p><p></p><p>He originally wanted to chat with Li Shuyan a little more, but considering Lu Changsheng in the flying chariot, he simply gave up.</p><p></p><p>Sighing regretfully, the old turtle also closed his eyes and entered a state of cultivation. His surroundings were illuminated by a series of dark green lights, making him appear indestructible.</p><p></p><p>The flying chariot became completely quiet, continuously shuttling through the endless void, passing through one layer of stars after another.</p><p></p><p>During this time, Li Shuyan would occasionally withdraw from his cultivation state and inject spiritual energy into the flying chariot to provide continuous power.</p><p></p><p>Time flowed like a river of sand, day after day, year after year.</p><p></p><p>Here is the full English translation of the Chinese excerpt:</p><p></p><p>The atmosphere was gloomy, damp, eerie, and chilling. </p><p></p><p>Deep within the thick fog, there were occasional shrill screams like the screeching of metal, sending shivers down one's spine.</p><p></p><p>"Drip... drip... drip..."</p><p></p><p>Footsteps could be heard from the depths of the mist, as if someone was stepping on the wet ground, but they vanished in an instant.</p><p></p><p>The next moment, five figures suddenly appeared. They first looked around to ensure they were hidden and safe, then stealthily gathered together.</p><p></p><p>The five exchanged glances and simultaneously raised their hands to create a sound-proof barrier.</p><p></p><p>"My friends, do you know why the Emperor has summoned you here today?" Zi Xuan Yong said expressionlessly, but a sinister and greedy glint flickered in his eyes.</p><p></p><p>The other four were the remaining four patriarchs besides Mang Tian and Jiang Wuxin who had appeared in the Eternal Celestial Domain that day - Blood Moon Ru, Blazing Wolf King, Demon King, and Nine-Winged King.</p><p></p><p>Blood Moon Ru and the others nodded in tacit understanding, their hearts burning with thoughts of the eternal immortal being.</p><p></p><p>"Imperial Zi, can we really trust what the ancient clans of the Eternal Celestial Domain said? Perhaps they just wanted to cause trouble for that Luo Longsheng before they died," Blood Moon Ru frowned and asked.</p><p></p><p>The Blazing Wolf King and the others also nodded slightly, admitting that they were unsure, after all, that was an immortal being transcending the Godly Ranks.</p><p></p><p>Who could guarantee it?</p><p></p><p>And to rush from the Divine-Demon Battlefield to the Eternal Celestial Domain to find Luo Longsheng, even at their fastest, it would take thousands of years.</p><p></p><p>Moreover, the Divine-Demon Battlefield had been very unstable recently, they couldn't afford to leave.</p><p></p><p>Zi Xuan Yong slowly said, "As long as it's related to the eternal immortal being, even if there's just the slightest chance, we must go all out, don't we?"</p><p></p><p>Blood Moon Ru and the others solemnly nodded. Of course, this was the case.</p><p></p><p>In fact, what they wanted to say was that they couldn't rush to find the eternal immortal being, because they couldn't leave the Divine-Demon Battlefield at the moment, so they didn't understand why Zi Xuan Yong had summoned them.</p><p></p><p>"Imperial Zi, we will definitely go find that Luo Longsheng, but not now. The Divine-Demon Battlefield has been too turbulent among the tribes recently..." the Demon King said in a deep voice.</p><p></p><p>"Hahaha, I'm sure you've misunderstood. I didn't summon you here today to go find that Luo Longsheng..." Suddenly, the Imperial Zi laughed helplessly.</p><p></p><p>Blood Moon Ru and the others were dumbfounded, and a flash of anger appeared on their faces!</p><p></p><p>Was the Imperial Zi just toying with them? They didn't have that much time!</p><p></p><p>"Don't be so quick to get angry, my friends. Let me ask you, besides us five, who else knows about Luo Longsheng, that eternal immortal being?" the Imperial Zi asked with narrowed eyes.</p><p></p><p>Blood Moon Ru and the others paused, then their expressions became serious. They were not fools, and they immediately understood what the Imperial Zi was getting at.</p><p></p><p>"Correct, you are all intelligent people. I'm sure you've grasped my meaning..." the Imperial Zi said with a cold smile:</p><p></p><p>"The Human Tribe's Mang King and Wind Venerable also know about the eternal immortal being. I don't know if they have any designs on it, but I know they haven't spread the news for now... But I'm not sure about the future."</p><p></p><p>"And since that Luo Longsheng seems to be from the Human Tribe, the fewer people who know about the eternal immortal being, the better..."</p><p></p><p>Towards the end, the Imperial Zi's expression became sinister.</p><p></p><p>Blood Moon Ru and the others exchanged glances, they understood...</p><p></p><p>"Imperial Zi, the Mang King and Wind Venerable hold high positions in the Human Tribe, so we need to tread carefully on this matter," the Nine-Winged King said solemnly.</p><p></p><p>On the Divine-Demon Battlefield, the Human Tribe may not rank very high, but they have a large population and strong cohesion, and they also have many powerful experts, especially ones that instill fear in the five tribes, like Jian Wuhuai.</p><p></p><p>This must be the purpose for which the Imperial Zi had summoned them to discuss.</p>

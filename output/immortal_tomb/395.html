        <h1>Chapter 395</h1>
        <div class="content">
            <p>Here is the full English translation of the Chinese excerpt:</p><p></p><p>As the arrogant words of God Thunder fell, the Heavenly God Tribe finally erupted in a frenzy of cries:</p><p></p><p>"Lord God Sovereign, unrivaled in the world!"</p><p>"Lord God Sovereign, unrivaled in the world!!"</p><p>"......"</p><p></p><p>At this moment, God Thunder gently closed his eyes, savoring it, but soon he felt unsatisfied!</p><p></p><p>He opened his eyes and lightly raised his hand, and the Heavenly God Tribe fell silent, with all the tribesmen kneeling on the ground, reverently looking at him.</p><p></p><p>God Thunder first looked at the ground, and then looked at the Crow Tribe Chief on the cliff, and said indifferently, "God Moon, God Star."</p><p></p><p>"Here!" God Moon and God Star responded hastily.</p><p></p><p>"Hmm." God Thunder sneered, "Bi You, Ao Zhen Tian and the others, I have left them with a breath of life. You go and bind them, including the Crow Tribe Chief, and tie them to the stone pillars in our Heavenly God Square!"</p><p></p><p>"Yes!" God Moon and God Star immediately obeyed the order and got up to do it.</p><p></p><p>God Thunder waved his hand and said, "No hurry, I still have one more thing to command..."</p><p></p><p>God Moon and God Star paused, then hurriedly came back and bowed.</p><p></p><p>God Thunder chuckled and asked, "Is the God Child still in the Human Tribe?"</p><p></p><p>God Moon and God Star trembled, lowering their heads and answering in a trembling voice, "Yes..."</p><p></p><p>"Very good." God Thunder continued, "Our Heavenly God Tribe's Third God Official has also perished..."</p><p></p><p>God Moon, God Star, and all the Heavenly God Tribe members dared not speak. At this moment, everyone could feel the crazy killing intent in God Thunder's calm words!!</p><p></p><p>God Thunder raised his old eyes, looking towards the southeast, the direction of the Human Tribe's territory, and then smiled and said:</p><p></p><p>"God Moon, spread the news to all tribes, that I, the God Sovereign, have achieved the realm of Godhood. To celebrate this great event, in one month, there will be a Grand Godhood Ceremony, and all tribes shall come and pay their respects!! Those who do not come... will be annihilated!"</p><p></p><p>"Yes!" God Moon loudly acknowledged.</p><p></p><p>The eyes of all the Heavenly God Tribe members shone with excitement. They eagerly anticipated the arrival of all tribes in one month!!</p><p></p><p>Those who do not come, will be annihilated!</p><p></p><p>How tyrannical the Heavenly God Tribe is!</p><p></p><p>As members of the Heavenly God Tribe, they could only feel an overwhelming sense of honor at this moment.</p><p></p><p>...</p><p></p><p>Soon, the news released by the Heavenly God Tribe swept across the Godly-Demonic Battlefield!</p><p></p><p>The God Sovereign has reached the Godhood realm, and the Tribe Chiefs of the Beast Tribe, Dragon Tribe, and other nine major tribes have all been captured!</p><p></p><p>The God Sovereign has ordered all tribes to gather at the Heavenly God Tribe in one month to attend the Grand Godhood Ceremony, to celebrate the God Sovereign's breakthrough to Godhood...</p><p></p><p>All tribes understood that this was not a celebration ceremony, but rather a demonstration of power! </p><p></p><p>They might even publicly execute and devour the Tribe Chiefs of the top ten peak tribes... as well as the Human Tribe, which has a towering enmity with the Heavenly God Tribe!!</p><p></p><p>It is clear that the Heavenly God Tribe wants to take this opportunity to completely dominate the Godly-Demonic Battlefield!</p><p></p><p>At this moment, all tribes are trembling with fear, and the first thing they did after receiving the news was to hurriedly gather their troops and march towards the Heavenly God Tribe.</p><p></p><p>After all, one month's time is quite rushed.</p><p></p><p>...</p><p></p><p>In the Human Tribe's territory, it is completely silent!</p><p></p><p>Only Shen Luo, who is bound outside the Sky City, is laughing maniacally: "Hahaha...!"</p><p></p><p>But the Holy Sons, Holy Daughters, and Elders bound with him have gloomy and pale faces, not a trace of happiness.</p><p></p><p>Their Tribe Chiefs have all been dealt with by the God Sovereign...</p><p></p><p>Their Tribe Chiefs' situation must be no different from theirs!</p><p></p><p>"Haha, Lu Nan!! Speak up! Speak up!! Weren't you so arrogant before?" </p><p></p><p>At this time, Shen Luo raised his head and shouted loudly, venting the suppression in his heart over this period.</p><p></p><p>The Human Tribe's territory fell into a long silence, with no one responding.</p><p></p><p>Seeing this, Shen Luo's heart was even more unrestrained, and he shouted:</p><p></p><p>"Hehe, Lu Nan, are you too scared to speak now? Have you become a coward? Where was that bravado earlier!"</p><p></p><p>Shen Luo was sure that Lu Changsheng had become a coward.</p><p></p><p>He was also sure that the Human Tribe dared not attack him, because... if they did, the Human Tribe would have to pay the price of the entire tribe's annihilation on the Godly-Demonic Battlefield!</p><p></p><p>Now, even if the Human Tribe had a glimmer of hope, they would not dare to attack him.</p><p></p><p>And Shen Luo believed that soon...</p><p></p><p>Here is the full English translation of the Chinese excerpt:</p><p></p><p>Soon, someone would come down to release him.</p><p></p><p>Sure enough, in the next moment, the five leaders of the human race appeared outside the city walls of the Heavenly City.</p><p></p><p>Shenlo's spirit was invigorated!</p><p></p><p>Jian Wuhui's eyes flickered, and with a wave of his hand, he released Shenlo and the others who were bound to the city wall, but did not untie them.</p><p></p><p>Shenlo looked at the ropes on his body, furrowed his brows, and looked at Jian Wuhui, saying mockingly, "Jian Wuhui, what do you mean?"</p><p></p><p>Han Jinlong's eyes turned sharp as he sternly said, "Shenlo, behave yourself, don't forget that you are still in our human race's hands!!"</p><p></p><p>How could they possibly let Shenlo go so easily? </p><p></p><p>During the upcoming Divine Ceremony, there would definitely be changes, and the Divine Lord would certainly publicly dispute with their human race!</p><p></p><p>And Shenlo, naturally, was their trump card and hostage.</p><p></p><p>If the Divine Lord acted recklessly, then they also had a backup plan.</p><p></p><p>The main issue was that Lord Lu was not here now, the old turtle said Lord Lu had some matters to attend to, so now they could only make decisions on their own.</p><p></p><p>Shenlo raised his eyebrows, his eyes fierce, but he did not speak. He also understood the plans of Jian Wuhui and the others.</p><p></p><p>"Lord Jian, should we release the holy sons and daughters of the other major clans?"</p><p></p><p>At this time, Jiang Wuxin transmitted a voice message.</p><p></p><p>Jian Wuhui hesitated slightly, for now the clan heads of the top ten clans were also being held hostage by the Divine Clan, in a sense they had a common enemy...</p><p></p><p>But soon, Jian Wuhui thought of Lord Lu, and said, "Without Lord Lu's intention, we will not release them for now."</p><p></p><p>Jiang Wuxin understood, and did not speak further.</p><p></p><p>Jian Wuhui took a light breath and ordered, "Gather all the human race disciples above the Divine Profound level."</p><p></p><p>Subsequently, more than a hundred strong cultivators above the Divine Profound level gathered.</p><p></p><p>Aside from the three Divine Seclusion experts, there were also Fang Yun, Mo Lianqiu, Shui Tinghen and other Divine Profound experts.</p><p></p><p>Although their human race had many Jade Hearts, unfortunately the time was too short.</p><p></p><p>Even though they had given many Jade Hearts to the late-stage Divine Dao cultivators, it was impossible for anyone to break through to the Divine Profound level in a short time.</p><p></p><p>The crowd looked around and did not see the figure in blue, unable to help but hesitate.</p><p></p><p>Where was Lord Lu?</p><p></p><p>Without Lord Lu, they truly felt a sense of unease in their hearts.</p><p></p><p>It can be said that Lord Lu was their last spiritual pillar.</p><p></p><p>"Hey, Lord Jian, how come you didn't call me for such a big matter," the old turtle arrived late, chuckling.</p><p></p><p>"Hehe, old turtle," Jian Wuhui smiled kindly at him.</p><p></p><p>The crowd was not surprised, after all they were already familiar with the old turtle, and they all knew the old turtle was Lord Lu's mount.</p><p></p><p>"Master."</p><p></p><p>Suddenly, a flash of red light flashed by, transforming into a beautiful woman, which was Hong Yun.</p><p></p><p>Jian Wuhui's eyes flickered slightly: "Hong Yun, are you going as well?"</p><p></p><p>Hong Yun softly said, "Of course."</p><p></p><p>If something happened to Jian Wuhui, she wouldn't be able to live either.</p><p></p><p>At the same time, more and more cultivators gathered, a vast crowd, the number impossible to estimate.</p><p></p><p>The cultivators all looked at the five leaders and the group of Divine Profound experts with grim expressions, knowing that Jian Wuhui and the others going to the Divine Clan was extremely dangerous.</p><p></p><p>"Lord Jian, we..."</p><p></p><p>Jian Wuhui and the others looked at the dense crowd of human race cultivators, Jian Wuhui pretended to smile lightly and said, "Everyone, just stay safely within the clan."</p><p></p><p>Although all the tribes had to attend the Divine Ceremony, their human race's population base was so large, it was not realistic.</p><p></p><p>After saying that, Jian Wuhui suppressed his smile, pursed his lips and continued, "If we encounter any accidents in the Divine Clan this time, then you all should disperse, try to escape as far as possible!"</p><p></p><p>"Let's go!"</p><p></p><p>The next moment, Jian Wuhui and the others' eyes turned fierce, and they took the bound Shenlo and the others and soared into the air!</p><p></p><p>The human race cultivators' eyes turned red, their lips trembling, unable to speak, their fists clenched, their nails digging deeply into the flesh!</p>

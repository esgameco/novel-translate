        <h1>Chapter 4</h1>
        <div class="content">
            <p>Here is the full English translation of the Chinese excerpt:</p><p></p><p>After a moment. ‚òÖüíî‚ûÖ‚ùæ·îï–Ω√π·ô≠.ùïîœå‚ìú‚ôô‚òÆ</p><p></p><p>Chen Dadao took a deep breath and forcibly withdrew his gaze, suppressing his violent heartbeat and speaking in a low voice: "Let's go sit over there."</p><p></p><p>The steward swallowed dryly, then followed Chen Dadao to the seat, knowing that this matter could not be rushed.</p><p></p><p>He also saw from Chen Dadao's reaction that this refined young man in blue robes might indeed be the legendary immortal!</p><p></p><p>Soon, the two came to a table slightly to the side of Lu Changsheng and nervously sat down. From their angle, they could clearly see Lu Changsheng's profile.</p><p></p><p>...</p><p></p><p>"Gentlemen, your peach blossom wine, please enjoy." </p><p></p><p>The waiter placed down two pots of peach blossom wine and discreetly glanced at the strange attire of Chen Dadao and the steward before withdrawing.</p><p></p><p>The steward spoke in a low voice: "Magistrate, we..."</p><p></p><p>Chen Dadao withdrew his gaze from looking at Lu Changsheng and said in a low voice: "Let's drink first."</p><p></p><p>On the surface, Chen Dadao appeared calm, but from his fingers that had turned pale from gripping, one could see how nervous he was at the moment.</p><p></p><p>"Yes." The steward picked up the wine pot and began pouring, his hand trembling slightly as well.</p><p></p><p>These details did not escape Lu Changsheng's notice.</p><p></p><p>Lu Changsheng did not look at them, only quietly drinking by himself, though he felt a bit helpless inside.</p><p></p><p>Handsome appearance and refined temperament could save one from a lot of trouble, but it could also attract many trivial matters.</p><p></p><p>Just then,</p><p></p><p>Chen Dadao could no longer hold back, and he and the steward, holding wine cups, came before Lu Changsheng one after the other, raising their cups and bowing slightly: "This... sir, we have observed that you are quite extraordinary, surely from a distinguished family, and we greatly admire you. We have come to offer you a toast."</p><p></p><p>As the saying goes, "Don't slap a smiling face," Lu Changsheng also nodded slightly at them, but did not raise his cup.</p><p></p><p>Seeing this, Chen Dadao and the steward hurriedly raised their cups and drained them in one gulp.</p><p></p><p>After drinking, they felt awkward, not knowing what to do next, as the pressure was immense in front of this young man in blue robes!</p><p></p><p>After hesitating for a while, Chen Dadao finally mustered the courage to ask in a trembling voice, "Sir, may we sit here and drink with you?"</p><p></p><p>Seeing that Lu Changsheng still remained silent, Chen Dadao's face turned slightly pale, feeling a bit at a loss.</p><p></p><p>"Don't waste your effort, your innate qualities are not suitable for cultivating immortality," the silent Lu Changsheng suddenly put down his cup and said slowly while looking at Chen Dadao.</p><p></p><p>Chen Dadao and the steward were suddenly struck with dread!</p><p></p><p>The immortal truly lived up to his reputation, as he had already known their purpose even before they had said anything!</p><p></p><p>But soon, the composed Chen Dadao's pupils contracted, and he trembled as he asked in a low voice, "Sir, am I really not suitable for cultivating immortality?"</p><p></p><p>Lu Changsheng nodded slightly.</p><p></p><p>Chen Dadao immediately staggered, his eyes losing their luster.</p><p></p><p>"Magistrate..." The steward behind him hurriedly supported him.</p><p></p><p>The commotion naturally attracted the attention of the other patrons, as well as the innkeeper and the waiter.</p><p></p><p>The other patrons first looked at Lu Changsheng with reverence, then curiously at the tightly wrapped Chen Dadao and the steward, not knowing the meaning of their actions.</p><p></p><p>The innkeeper frowned slightly, as someone had disturbed the young man in blue robes while he was drinking, so he discreetly signaled the waiter.</p><p></p><p>The waiter hurriedly went over and frowned at Chen Dadao and the steward, saying, "Gentlemen, please do not disturb the other patrons' drinking."</p><p></p><p>"It's fine," Lu Changsheng said softly.</p><p></p><p>The waiter paused, then silently withdrew.</p><p></p><p>"Sir, do you have a place to rest in this Lianyu Town? If not, may we invite you to our humble abode to stay for a while?" </p><p></p><p>Although Chen Dadao's heart was dejected, he still thought that if he could invite the immortal to his residence, it might be a rare opportunity.</p><p></p><p>Here is the full English translation of the Chinese excerpt:</p><p></p><p>When the Immortal came to visit the lord's residence, there might be a turning point.</p><p></p><p>Go to the new 69 book bar ‚Üí 69shux.com</p><p></p><p>If it's really impossible to cultivate immortality, then even just catching a whiff of immortal energy would be great.</p><p></p><p>After saying this, he looked at Lu Changsheng with an extremely eager gaze.</p><p></p><p>Lu Changsheng glanced at the sky and softly said, "Then I'll be intruding."</p><p></p><p>Chen Dadao trembled with excitement and joyfully said, "No, no intrusion, this is an honor for me!"</p><p></p><p>The steward was also thrilled, wondering if he would have the chance to witness the legendary immortal arts!</p><p></p><p>"Have a seat," Lu Changsheng said.</p><p></p><p>"Yes, yes, yes!" </p><p></p><p>Chen Dadao nodded like a pecking chick, quickly sitting down with the steward, both of them very restrained in front of Lu Changsheng.</p><p></p><p>It was only then that they clearly saw Lu Changsheng's face, and their hearts were filled with admiration. Truly an immortal, so transcendent, like a blue lotus. He gave off a very pure feeling, and the steward swore he had never seen such a noble person in his life.</p><p></p><p>Although Chen Dadao had seen immortals before, when compared to this one, he found the one before him to be even more superior!</p><p></p><p>"Sir, if the food and wine are not enough, please feel free to order more, I'll treat you!" </p><p></p><p>Chen Dadao thumped his chest as he spoke, fawning excessively.</p><p></p><p>Seeing Chen Dadao's unusually enthusiastic behavior, the steward inwardly sighed, realizing the lord was not usually like this.</p><p></p><p>"The weather is so hot, aren't you two uncomfortable in those outfits?" </p><p></p><p>Lu Changsheng swirled the wine in his cup and spoke softly.</p><p></p><p>Chen Dadao trembled, thinking the immortal was displeased, as the concealing attire was indeed impolite, especially in front of an immortal. He hurriedly said, "Yes, it is stuffy, as the sir has said!"</p><p></p><p>He then signaled to the steward with his eyes, and they both promptly removed their concealing hats. However, their hearts were racing...</p><p></p><p>Sure enough, the customers in the tavern who occasionally glanced this way were stunned, their gazes fixed.</p><p></p><p>"Lord Zhen!" </p><p></p><p>The customers suddenly became agitated. The lord himself was actually drinking in this small tavern?!</p><p></p><p>The customers hastily got up and hurried over, fearfully paying their respects: "We humble commoners greet the Lord Zhen!"</p><p></p><p>Seeing the tavern suddenly become so noisy, the proprietor and waiter were also dumbfounded!</p><p></p><p>One of those strangely dressed people was actually their lord?!</p><p></p><p>The waiter immediately turned pale as he looked at the proprietor, inwardly panicking, thinking the proprietor had really done it this time.</p><p></p><p>Chen Dadao glanced awkwardly at Lu Changsheng, then signaled to the steward.</p><p></p><p>The steward understood, sternly shouting, "You all go back first, can't you see the Lord Zhen is drinking with the... sir?"</p><p></p><p>The customers hurriedly nodded and returned to their seats, no longer daring to converse.</p><p></p><p>They all looked at Lu Changsheng with reverence, inwardly sighing that this person was indeed as extraordinary as they had imagined!</p><p></p><p>They were not fools, and by putting the pieces together, they could easily deduce that the Lord Zhen had deliberately disguised himself to seek out this young man in blue.</p><p></p><p>"Lord... Lord Zhen, sir, this is the wine and food we offer you for free..."</p><p></p><p>At this time, the pale-faced proprietor personally brought over more wine and dishes, carefully placing them on the table before retreating without daring to look up.</p><p></p><p>Chen Dadao looked at the calm Lu Changsheng across from him and said with restraint, "Sir, I must confess, I am the lord of Moyu Town."</p><p></p><p>Lu Changsheng nodded, unfazed.</p><p></p><p>Chen Dadao naturally knew that he, as a mere town lord, was nothing in the eyes of an immortal. He then personally picked up the wine pitcher to pour a cup for Lu Changsheng.</p><p></p><p>"Sir, please."</p><p></p><p>This scene once again left the patrons of the tavern gaping in astonishment.</p><p>Just who was this young man in blue?</p>

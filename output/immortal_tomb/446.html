        <h1>Chapter 446</h1>
        <div class="content">
            <p>Here is the full English translation of the Chinese excerpt:</p><p></p><p>Two days later, the imperial carriage finally crossed the great divide and arrived at the other side.</p><p></p><p>"Old Ye, then we shall return to the clan first, and we can continue our conversation another day."</p><p></p><p>Zhao Kun cupped his hands and said respectfully, casting an awestruck glance at the figure within the imperial carriage, not daring to linger.</p><p></p><p>These past two days, he had not dared to ask Senior Ye Xunwang about the background of this mysterious azure-robed gentleman, or what relationship he had with the Ye Clan, not even daring to inquire about the rumors.</p><p></p><p>This nameless, faceless azure-robed gentleman was truly terrifying!</p><p></p><p>Zhao Kun was certain that, setting aside the ancient patriarchs of the super ancient clans, this azure-robed gentleman was the most powerful being he had ever encountered.</p><p></p><p>"Alright, then we shall continue our discussion another day. I also have matters to attend to, so I shall not keep you any longer." Ye Xunwang returned the gesture of cupping his hands, while also winking at Zhao Kun.</p><p></p><p>Zhao Kun naturally understood the implication, and hastily bowed deeply towards the carriage, addressing Lu Changsheng respectfully:</p><p></p><p>"M-My lord, I shall take my leave with the clan disciples now, and not disturb you further."</p><p></p><p>Having said that, he did not dare to linger, quickly grabbing the reserved Zhao Gao and Zhao Yuan and departing.</p><p></p><p>After seeing them off, Ye Xunwang turned his gaze towards the carriage, inquiring reverently, "My lord, will you be returning to the Ye Clan with me, or..."</p><p></p><p>Lu Changsheng seemed to ponder for a moment before responding, "Then let us return to the Ye Clan together. I am still new to the Hollow Ancient Realm, so for the time being, you shall be my guide."</p><p></p><p>"It is my honor, Xunwang." Ye Xunwang replied joyfully, and then promptly set the carriage in motion, heading in a certain direction.</p><p></p><p>As for the old turtle, it remained unconscious within its shattered shell, and it seemed unlikely that it would awaken anytime soon.</p><p></p><p>...</p><p></p><p>In the Hollow Ancient Realm, the hierarchy among the ancient clans was clearly defined, divided into four common tiers: the lower ancient clans, the middle ancient clans, the upper ancient clans, and the super ancient clans.</p><p></p><p>In the Hollow Ancient Realm, there were only three super ancient clans: the He, the Ouyang, and the Hong!</p><p></p><p>As for the Ye Clan, when Ye Xunwang had left, it was still a middle ancient clan. After all these years, it had finally risen to the rank of an upper ancient clan.</p><p></p><p>Among the upper ancient clans in the Hollow Ancient Realm, they were already considered formidable powers.</p><p></p><p>"My lord, the Ye Clan's territory is just ahead."</p><p></p><p>Ye Xunwang looked at the massive clan settlement hovering in the sky with a complex expression, and then reported.</p><p></p><p>After being away from home for many years, he had a mix of emotions that he couldn't quite describe.</p><p></p><p>There was anticipation, but also a hesitation to face it.</p><p></p><p>The hesitation was due to his own cultivation, which had only reached the peak of the Divine Warrior realm.</p><p></p><p>Now, he imagined that many of his former juniors had likely surpassed him or reached a similar level.</p><p></p><p>Ye Xunwang thought of his old friend Zhao Kun, who had already reached the mid-stage of the Divine Spirit realm.</p><p></p><p>"Very well." Lu Changsheng responded, gazing at the Ye Clan.</p><p></p><p>Thereafter, Ye Xunwang quickly led Lu Changsheng to the entrance of the Ye Clan.</p><p></p><p>"Who goes there!" The two Ye Clan disciples guarding the gate immediately narrowed their eyes, demanding.</p><p></p><p>Ye Xunwang looked at the two familiar faces, then took a deep breath and revealed his Ye Clan bloodline imprint.</p><p></p><p>Huh?</p><p></p><p>The two Ye Clan disciples were first stunned, then stared at Ye Xunwang for a long while, "Uncle... Uncle Xunwang?"</p><p></p><p>Ye Xunwang was taken aback, not expecting that after all these years, there would still be Ye Clan disciples who recognized him. He nodded in response.</p><p></p><p>What he found even more unexpected was that he was also being addressed as "Uncle," just like his old friend Zhao Kun.</p><p></p><p>Zhao Kun's status and strength were well-established, so being called "Uncle" was understandable.</p><p></p><p>But Ye Xunwang, who had only reached the peak of the Divine Warrior realm after being away for so long, what right did he have to be called "Uncle"? Was it solely based on seniority?</p><p></p><p>Although Ye Xunwang was puzzled, seeing that the Ye Clan disciples did not look down on him, he felt relieved and responded gently, "I do not deserve the title of 'Uncle'..."</p><p></p><p>Here is the full English translation of the Chinese excerpt:</p><p></p><p>"Do not call me by that title anymore."</p><p></p><p>The two gate guards from the Ye clan were slightly taken aback, but they quickly understood Ye Xunwang's thoughts. However, they did not explain further, believing that Ye Xunwang would soon understand.</p><p></p><p>"Uncle Ye, your words carry weight."</p><p></p><p>Ye Xunwang nodded slightly, and then did not dare to say more, as Lu Changsheng was still standing beside him.</p><p></p><p>Ye Xunwang then slightly bowed towards Lu Changsheng and led him into the Ye clan.</p><p></p><p>The two Ye clan members looked curiously at the man in blue robes, but since he was brought by Ye Xunwang, they did not obstruct them, and only sent a message to the clan, informing them that Uncle Ye had returned, and that the newcomer was being guided.</p><p></p><p>The two Ye clan members were fortunate that they did not obstruct them, for the consequences would have been more than they could bear.</p><p></p><p>...</p><p></p><p>At the same time, </p><p></p><p>a Ye clan member was leading Ye Xunwang and Lu Changsheng through the grand Ye clan, occasionally introducing things along the way.</p><p></p><p>"Uncle Ye, you don't know, in the years you were away, our Ye clan has already risen to the rank of a top-tier ancient clan!" The guiding Ye clan member said proudly.</p><p></p><p>Although this Ye clan member was at the peak of the Shen Wu realm, just like Ye Xunwang, he was still very respectful towards Ye Xunwang.</p><p></p><p>The reason was that this Ye clan member was quite familiar with Ye Xunwang, and Ye Xunwang had taken care of him when they were young.</p><p></p><p>"Top-tier ancient clan? Ye Feng, are you telling the truth?" Ye Xunwang was quite shocked.</p><p></p><p>No wonder along the way, he found that the Ye clan had changed greatly, whether it was the spirit of the clan members or other aspects.</p><p></p><p>Ye Feng turned around and smiled, "Uncle Ye, would Feng'er dare to lie to you?"</p><p></p><p>Ye Xunwang, still shaken, was also worried about neglecting Lu Changsheng, so he quickly explained to Lu Changsheng:</p><p></p><p>"Sir, in the Hollow Ancient Realm, the ranking of ancient clans is clear, divided into lower, middle, upper, and super tiers. When I left the clan before, the Ye clan was still a middle-tier ancient clan. How times have changed..."</p><p></p><p>Lu Changsheng seemed not very interested, and just nodded slightly in acknowledgement.</p><p></p><p>Ye Feng then looked at Lu Changsheng with curiosity.</p><p></p><p>Although Xunwang Uncle had been away from the clan for many years and his cultivation progress was slow due to the lack of clan resources, he was still at the peak of the Shen Wu realm.</p><p></p><p>This man in blue robes must be able to make Xunwang Uncle show such respect, so he must be a powerful Shen Ling realm expert.</p><p></p><p>In the Hollow Ancient Realm, Shen Ling realm experts, although not the strongest, are still considered powerful.</p><p></p><p>After all, the strength of the clan heads of many lower-tier ancient clans is generally at the Shen Ling realm.</p><p></p><p>Soon, the three arrived outside a palace hall. Ye Xunwang's gaze was puzzled, not understanding why Ye Feng had brought him here.</p><p></p><p>But Ye Feng's next words shocked, bewildered, and made Ye Xunwang feel nervous.</p><p></p><p>"Uncle Ye, the clan leader and elders know you have returned, and are waiting for you in the hall."  Ye Feng bowed.</p><p></p><p>Ye Xunwang was confused, not understanding why they wanted to see him. He was just an ordinary Ye clan member who had been away for many years and was only at the Shen Wu realm.</p><p></p><p>Ye Xunwang quickly looked at Lu Changsheng, feeling uneasy. "Sir, you..."</p><p></p><p>"It's fine, I'll wander around by myself. This is your clan's affair, and as an outsider, I won't go in." Lu Changsheng said calmly.</p><p></p><p>"Uncle Ye, the clan leader and elders are waiting. You should go in. Feng'er will entertain the sir." Ye Feng smiled at Lu Changsheng after looking at him.</p>

        <h1>Chapter 49</h1>
        <div class="content">
            <p>Here is my translation of the Chinese excerpt:</p><p></p><p>"Shifu, the teacher said he's tired... What should we do?" </p><p></p><p>The child looked at Gu Helin pitifully. </p><p></p><p>Slap!</p><p></p><p>Gu Helin suddenly exploded, sternly reprimanding, "What kind of man has become so effeminate?"</p><p></p><p>The child winced in pain, covering his head, his expression turning serious.</p><p></p><p>"Hmph, that's more like it. You should learn from your junior Linden!"</p><p></p><p>Gu Helin said impatiently, then regretfully glanced at the courtyard before bowing and leaving.</p><p></p><p>The child secretly rolled his eyes, then imitated him and hurriedly followed.</p><p></p><p>...</p><p></p><p>In the Demon Realm, the dozing demonic beasts suddenly saw the two soul lamps on the platform extinguish...</p><p></p><p>He shrugged indifferently, but the carefree expression on his face gradually stiffened...</p><p></p><p>He then abruptly stood up, a look of terror appearing!</p><p></p><p>"The Demon King's Wolf General, the Demon King's Porcupine General!!"</p><p></p><p>These two extinguished soul lamps belonged to the two demon generals.</p><p></p><p>The demonic beast's mouth twitched, then he stumbled and rushed out, "Oh no, oh no!"</p><p></p><p>...</p><p></p><p>"What did you say?"</p><p></p><p>Boom!</p><p></p><p>The demonic beast was kicked down by the fierce Teng Snake, who coldly demanded an explanation.</p><p></p><p>The demonic beast quickly resumed a kneeling position and trembled as he reported, "Your Majesty the Demon King, the soul lamps of the Wolf and Porcupine Demon Generals have been extinguished."</p><p></p><p>After a long silence, Teng Snake's brow furrowed, and he disappeared from the spot, wanting to go see for himself.</p><p></p><p>Soon, his figure reappeared, but his brow was tightly knit.</p><p></p><p>The two demon generals were creatures of some status even in the Demon Realm, yet they had died just like that? </p><p></p><p>It had been such a short time since that powerful cultivator seemed to be hiding in the Distant Water Empire...</p><p></p><p>The Sect Master of the Azure Cloud Sect?</p><p></p><p>Impossible, the Wolf and Porcupine could not have been defeated by the Azure Cloud Sect's Sect Master, they should have been able to escape!</p><p></p><p>Could it be other cultivators from the Spiritual Dust Cultivation World...?</p><p></p><p>It seems I need to go to the Demon Realm and settle the account with Zhao Shenyuan, though I'll no doubt have to endure his mocking again.</p><p></p><p>"Get out of here."</p><p></p><p>Teng Snake said indifferently before disappearing.</p><p></p><p>The nervous demonic beast finally heaved a huge sigh of relief, having been terrified and drenched in sweat. He was truly afraid that the Demon King Teng Snake would kill him in a fit of anger.</p><p></p><p>...</p><p></p><p>In the Demon Realm's palace, Zhao Shenyuan was drinking with Chu Qingcang when they suddenly heard a cold shout outside.</p><p></p><p>"Zhao Shenyuan, come out!"</p><p></p><p>Zhao Shenyuan smiled at Chu Qingcang, and the two of them disappeared from their seats.</p><p></p><p>When they reappeared, they were standing face to face with Teng Snake and another Demon King.</p><p></p><p>Without waiting for Teng Snake to speak, Zhao Shenyuan crooked his mouth in a smile and said, "Demon King Teng, have you already conquered the Distant Water and come to show off?"</p><p></p><p>"Congratulations, congratulations, you truly are formidable, Demon King Teng," Chu Qingcang also cupped his hands and smiled.</p><p></p><p>Seeing this, Teng Snake was immediately infuriated, his face flushed, and he said in a deep voice, "Zhao Shenyuan, you deliberately provoked me before. Why didn't you tell me the Distant Water had a powerful cultivator guarding it? It's caused me to lose two demon generals in the Demon Realm!"</p><p></p><p>Zhao Shenyuan had originally wanted to continue mocking, but hearing Teng Snake's last sentence, his gaze narrowed slightly.</p><p></p><p>Two demon generals died? </p><p></p><p>Compared to that, the failures of the Black Tongue Demon and the Nightmare Demon Tribe he had previously dispatched were nothing.</p><p></p><p>"Today, you must give me an explanation."</p><p></p><p>Seeing Zhao Shenyuan remain silent, Teng Snake stared at him coldly.</p><p></p><p>Here is the full English translation of the Chinese excerpt:</p><p></p><p>"Explanation? What explanation do you want to hear?" Zhao Shenyuan said calmly with a faint smile.</p><p></p><p>"So my two demon generals just died like that?" Lie Tenghe clenched his fist and said grimly.</p><p></p><p>"Haha! You, Lie Tenghe, are the head of the Five Great Demon Kings in the Demon Realm, yet instead of going after the culprit, you come to demand an explanation from me? How amusing..." Zhao Shenyuan waved his sleeve disdainfully.</p><p></p><p>"So, you're saying you won't give me an explanation today." Lie Tenghe's voice suddenly lowered, as if muttering to himself.</p><p></p><p>Zhao Shenyuan's eyes flashed for a moment, then he smiled and said, "No explanation will be given, but as for the rest, I'll accompany you."</p><p></p><p>Seeing this, the gazes of Chu Qingcang and the other Demon Kings beside Lie Tenghe also gradually converged, and their fists slowly clenched.</p><p></p><p>It seems this matter won't be resolved today...</p><p></p><p>The atmosphere in the venue suddenly became tense!</p><p></p><p>"Very good, you Zhao Shenyuan indeed have guts. Since you won't give an explanation, then let me beat one out of you!!" Lie Tenghe's mouth curled up in a sinister smile, and his aura burst forth tremendously.</p><p></p><p>"Caw caw caw..."</p><p></p><p>The crows perched on the withered trees were startled and flew away in droves.</p><p></p><p>"I'm being too nice to you, you reckless fool!" Zhao Shenyuan sneered, and a large amount of dense fog erupted around his body, making his figure appear and disappear.</p><p></p><p>"Golden Ape Demon King, follow me to fight!" Lie Tenghe roared, and his body instantly transformed into a thousand-zhang-long serpent coiling and twisting, with a pair of small wings on its back.</p><p></p><p>Its scarlet eyes and huge snake tongue flickering in and out looked extremely terrifying.</p><p></p><p>The Golden Ape Demon King also transformed into a giant ape the size of a mountain, baring its fangs and glaring fiercely at Zhao Shenyuan and Chu Qingcang.</p><p></p><p>"Qingcang, your strength is the greatest among the Five Great Demon Kings, so bringing down this damned Golden Ape should be no problem, right?" Zhao Shenyuan said with squinted eyes.</p><p></p><p>Chu Qingcang looked up at the giant ape and grinned, "I've heard that among the Five Great Demon Kings in the Demon Realm, the Golden Ape Demon King's strength is also the greatest. Today, I shall experience it for myself."</p><p></p><p>"And by the way, it's not necessarily the case that the bigger one is the stronger one..."</p><p></p><p>The next moment, Chu Qingcang pushed off the ground with his toes and shot towards the Golden Ape Demon King like a cannon shell!</p><p></p><p>"Boom!"</p><p></p><p>The ground beneath his feet instantly shattered and cracked like a spider web.</p><p></p><p>"Hehe, Qingcang may seem silly normally, but when he fights, he's really different," Zhao Shenyuan sighed, then looked up at Lie Tenghe and said lightly, "Qingcang is right, it's not necessarily the case that the bigger one is the stronger one, you reckless fools... trash."</p><p></p><p>Lie Tenghe's pupils suddenly flashed with ferocity, and he pounced with his huge serpent body, "Zhao Shenyuan, if I don't beat you to a pulp today, I'm not Lie!"</p><p></p><p>At the same time, the huge commotion coming from the Deep Abyss Demon Palace naturally attracted the attention of many demon beasts. They watched the hovering giant serpent and the giant ape in shock, and without hesitation, they went to inform the other three Demon Kings.</p><p></p><p>"Boom!" The Golden Ape Demon King's punch came crashing down, but was steadily blocked by Chu Qingcang's fist.</p><p></p><p>The visual impact was extremely strong, as the Golden Ape Demon King's fist was hundreds of times larger than Chu Qingcang's body.</p><p></p><p>"I've heard before that Demon King Qingcang's true body is a demon beast, yet his strength is immense. At first, I didn't believe it, but today I believe it," the Golden Ape Demon King's somewhat solemn voice rang out in the air.</p><p></p><p>It couldn't quite accept the fact that a demon beast's strength could be comparable to a demon king's. It was unbelievable.</p>

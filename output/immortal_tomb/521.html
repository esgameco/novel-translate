        <h1>Chapter 521</h1>
        <div class="content">
            <p>Here is the full English translation of the excerpt from the Chinese novel:</p><p></p><p>Lu Changsheng quickly followed the lead of the three young ladies and entered the Qiuqing Pavilion with his hands behind his back.</p><p></p><p>Outside the Qiuqing Pavilion, the onlookers were stunned, staring at each other in disbelief.</p><p></p><p>Huh?</p><p></p><p>Mr. Lu just went in there?</p><p></p><p>He's a teacher, isn't he? Isn't he afraid of being gossiped about for going to a brothel?</p><p></p><p>After all, the other teachers in town have never dared to go near the brothel in front of everyone's eyes. They usually avoid it and stay far away when walking on the street.</p><p></p><p>The onlookers exchanged glances and let out a wry smile before leaving, one by one.</p><p></p><p>Of course, they wouldn't dare to discuss it or spread the news, since Mr. Lu was a man of some standing.</p><p></p><p>It just felt a bit strange... the moral decline of the times, sigh.</p><p></p><p>Meanwhile, inside the Qiuqing Pavilion.</p><p></p><p>The sound of the guqin was graceful, and the place was lively with red lanterns and wine.</p><p></p><p>On the stage, there were dancing girls, and around them, many customers were sitting, embracing the ladies, taking small sips of wine from their mouths, all with joyful expressions. After all, with their eyes feasting on the sight and their hands caressing the girls, how could they not be delighted?</p><p></p><p>But the moment Lu Changsheng appeared, following the three young ladies...</p><p></p><p>"Pfft!"</p><p></p><p>A customer caught a glimpse of him and turned to look, then suddenly spat out the wine in his mouth.</p><p></p><p>Hearing the abrupt commotion, the others couldn't help but look over as well, and naturally saw the man in the blue robe.</p><p></p><p>"Pfft! Pfft! Pfft!... Cough, cough, cough!!"</p><p></p><p>The others similarly spat out the wine in their mouths, and some even choked on it, their faces flushed red.</p><p></p><p>The music and dancing also stopped at some point, and the ladies were staring blankly at the boldly standing man in the blue robe.</p><p></p><p>Mr. Lu?? </p><p></p><p>The customers hastily pushed away the girls in their arms and stood up, ready to greet Lu Changsheng.</p><p></p><p>Lu Changsheng waved his hand and frowned, saying, "Please continue with the music and dancing. Have I disturbed your refined pleasures?"</p><p></p><p>If he had known it would be like this, he should have been even more low-key before. Lu Changsheng knew that everyone was so respectful to him because of the attitude the town lord's people had shown him that day.</p><p></p><p>But he had already been very low-key.</p><p></p><p>"No, no, not at all!" the people hurriedly waved their hands.</p><p></p><p>"Mr. Lu, we were just... just surprised..." someone said hesitantly.</p><p></p><p>"Surprised by what?" Lu Changsheng asked.</p><p></p><p>The people looked at each other, not daring to say anything further. They truly didn't understand what the man in the blue robe was thinking.</p><p></p><p>Lu Changsheng let out a leisurely laugh and said, "I know what you all are thinking. It's simply that I, as a teacher who educates and nurtures people, have entered this place of romantic indulgence, isn't that right?"</p><p></p><p>Yes, yes, yes!</p><p></p><p>The customers laughed awkwardly, and even the ladies were curiously looking at Lu Changsheng.</p><p></p><p>"Haha."</p><p></p><p>Lu Changsheng chuckled and asked with interest, "Who decreed that a teacher cannot enter a brothel? Was it you? Or you? Or you?"</p><p></p><p>The people he asked all shook their heads.</p><p></p><p>"A gentleman judges by deeds, not by appearances, that's correct. But if a gentleman judges by heart, not by deeds, is that wrong? In some matters, it's not absolute, is it?"</p><p></p><p>The people paused, deep in thought.</p><p></p><p>Lu Changsheng strolled leisurely, hands behind his back, and smiled, "For example, even though I have entered this brothel, my heart remains clear and without any improper thoughts. Isn't that judging by heart, not by deeds?"</p><p></p><p>The people looked at each other, feeling that he made a lot of sense.</p><p></p><p>"And not to mention, I haven't even done anything yet. Even if I took a step back and said that the world is now full of men with multiple wives and concubines, isn't a brothel reasonable? I'm not a monk, and if I happen to have some improper thoughts, what's wrong with coming to this place of romantic indulgence to relieve my urges? It's not a big deal."</p><p></p><p>"As for educating and nurturing people, it's true that teaching by example is important. But as long as I've imparted the lessons well into the hearts of my students, what's the need for exemplary conduct?"</p><p></p><p>Lu Changsheng smiled slightly, "As for how other teachers conduct themselves..."</p><p></p><p>Here is the full English translation of the Chinese excerpt:</p><p></p><p>"I won't make any judgments, since this matter is reasonable from my perspective."</p><p></p><p>Clap, clap, clap, clap, clap, clap, clap!</p><p></p><p>The Qiuqing Pavilion fell silent for a moment, then erupted into enthusiastic applause.</p><p></p><p>Everyone stared intently at the calm and composed young man in green.</p><p></p><p>Lu Changsheng was like a shooting star, streaking across the dark night, allowing everyone to see such a unique schoolmaster for the first time.</p><p></p><p>Surprisingly, he really spoke so reasonably, so uniquely, so freely.</p><p></p><p>This is a true gentleman!</p><p></p><p>As long as the words are conveyed properly, what need is there for personal example? His words were refreshing and made sense!</p><p></p><p>And those other scholars were just unwilling to lose face and let go.</p><p></p><p>Some of them had even seen the few local schoolmasters sneaking into the Qiuqing Pavilion in the dead of night, in an unseemly manner.</p><p></p><p>In contrast, someone like Mr. Lu, so open and upright, is so much better!</p><p></p><p>"Everyone, enjoy yourselves. I'll cover everyone's expenses tonight."</p><p></p><p>Lu Changsheng waved his hand casually and announced generously.</p><p></p><p>The guests were stunned for a moment, then exclaimed excitedly:</p><p></p><p>"Mr. Lu is mighty!!!"</p><p></p><p>The next moment, the music and dancing continued, and the atmosphere in the Qiuqing Pavilion reached its peak.</p><p></p><p>The guests embraced the girls and came to toast Lu Changsheng joyfully.</p><p></p><p>Nearby, a girl quickly grabbed a clean cup, poured some wine, and offered the wine cup to Lu Changsheng.</p><p></p><p>Lu Changsheng took it, raised the cup to the toasting crowd, and said, "Enjoy yourselves."</p><p></p><p>He then drained the cup in one gulp and followed the three girls as they led him upstairs.</p><p></p><p>"Mr. Lu is truly unique, this temperament, I like it!"</p><p></p><p>"You like it? Are you worthy of it? Even the town lord is respectful towards Mr. Lu. Mr. Lu is just handsome and kind-hearted. You're just floating on air because he gave you a good look, aren't you?"</p><p></p><p>"Hey, what's with the way you're talking? I was just expressing my admiration for Mr. Lu, what's your problem?"</p><p></p><p>The people around started to argue, with some even pushing the girl away and getting into a heated discussion.</p><p></p><p>...</p><p></p><p>As soon as Lu Changsheng sat down by the corridor on the second floor, led by the three girls, the Qiuqing Pavilion's madam came rushing over.</p><p></p><p>"Oh my, Mr. Lu, your esteemed presence, I should have come to welcome you!"</p><p></p><p>Earlier, she had been scolding the girls in the backyard, but upon learning of Lu Changsheng's arrival, she first paused, then hurriedly came over.</p><p></p><p>The madam then gestured to the three girls, signaling them to leave, as she would take care of things here.</p><p></p><p>The three girls pouted, bowed, and quickly went back downstairs to attend to the guests.</p><p></p><p>Lu Changsheng directly tossed a silver coin over, instructing, "Bring me a good wine, you don't need to bother with anything else."</p><p></p><p>"Oh yes, certainly, Mr. Lu!" </p><p></p><p>The madam caught the silver coin, glanced at it briefly, and quickly pocketed it, her mouth grinning wider than a hippopotamus. "Mr. Lu, please wait a moment!"</p><p></p><p>She then happily went downstairs.</p><p></p><p>Soon, the wine arrived, and the beautiful girl responsible for serving the wine was dismissed by Lu Changsheng with another silver coin.</p><p></p><p>At this time, the girl on the central stage downstairs caught a glimpse of Lu Changsheng sitting upstairs from the corner of her eye, and her waist movements became even more alluring in her performance.</p><p></p><p>Lu Changsheng's gaze remained calm and unaffected, while many of the guests were inflamed with desire, wishing they could act on it right then and there.</p><p></p><p>"Mr. Lu? Mr. Lu?"</p><p></p><p>Suddenly, a respectful and surprised voice sounded next to Lu Changsheng.</p>

        <h1>Chapter 351</h1>
        <div class="content">
            <p>Here is the full English translation of the Chinese excerpt:</p><p></p><p>"Washing the soul, brewing the dream?"</p><p></p><p>Hearing this, Han Jinlong eagerly poured a cup for himself and Lu Changsheng. </p><p></p><p>He picked up the cup, looking at the crystal-clear liquid inside, smelling the incredible aroma of the wine, his eyes filled with surprise.</p><p></p><p>"Drink it, the elders of my sect talk about this all the time," Lu Changsheng said with a faint smile.</p><p></p><p>Han Jinlong first took a sip, his expression immediately changing drastically, his eyes shining with excitement, then he gulped down the entire cup.</p><p></p><p>He tilted his head back slightly, eyes tightly shut, as if immersed in the joy of having his soul cleansed.</p><p></p><p>After a moment, Han Jinlong opened his eyes and looked at Lu Changsheng, murmuring, "Young friend Lu, this wine can be considered the best in the world..."</p><p></p><p>Whether or not Young friend Lu was willing to participate in the Seven-Colored Crystal Tower, this trip was not in vain.</p><p></p><p>This wine was the best he had ever tasted in his life.</p><p></p><p>After just one sip, it would be impossible to forget.</p><p></p><p>"It's just dregs," Lu Changsheng said with a faint smile, then gestured towards the "Brewing the Dream" wine.</p><p></p><p>Han Jinlong nodded, carefully picking up the "Brewing the Dream" wine and pouring a cup, his expression solemn.</p><p></p><p>He also first took a sip, then drained the cup in one gulp!</p><p></p><p>Boom!</p><p></p><p>Suddenly, his mind was shaken, like raging waves.</p><p></p><p>A series of images began to weave together, appearing in his mind!</p><p></p><p>"Whew - whew -!"</p><p></p><p>Lu Changsheng quietly watched as Han Jinlong, his face flushed, his expression shocked, his breathing rapid, his chest heaving!</p><p></p><p>After an unknown length of time, he suddenly opened his eyes and abruptly stood up!</p><p></p><p>After standing there dazed for a while, he looked at Lu Changsheng and shook his head with a wry smile: "Young friend Lu, this 'Brewing the Dream' wine does have some tricks up its sleeve, but in the end, it's just a dream..."</p><p></p><p>He then sat back down, his expression rather melancholic.</p><p></p><p>"What did you dream about?" Lu Changsheng asked with a smile.</p><p></p><p>Han Jinlong pursed his lips and said, "You may not believe it, but I dreamed that the human race had risen to the top of the Myriad Tribes Ranking, and in the Divine-Demon Battlefield, all the tribes were bowing and worshiping the human race - that scene was too crazy..."</p><p></p><p>"The images were so vivid that I became deeply immersed in it, unable to extricate myself, until the wine wore off that I realized it was just a dream."</p><p></p><p>"But at least I got to indulge in it a bit, hehe."</p><p></p><p>Lu Changsheng said mysteriously, "What if that wasn't just a dream?"</p><p></p><p>Huh?</p><p></p><p>Han Jinlong was slightly taken aback, then chuckled: "Young friend Lu, you're joking."</p><p></p><p>He thought Lu Changsheng, as a newcomer to the Divine-Demon Battlefield, was unaware of the human race's predicament.</p><p></p><p>In the current situation, if the human race could just hold on, that would already be considered good.</p><p></p><p>As for being the number one among the Myriad Tribes... that was just a dream, impossible, the difficulty of which was akin to an ant trying to shake the heavens.</p><p></p><p>"Hehe."</p><p></p><p>Lu Changsheng suddenly stood up, walked to the window, clasped his hands behind his back, and looked outside, smiling: </p><p></p><p>"But what if it's not impossible?"</p><p></p><p>Hearing this, Han Jinlong stared blankly at the figure in the blue robe, a strange feeling spreading in his heart, his face becoming somewhat stiff.</p><p></p><p>"The human race is the leader of the Myriad Tribes, the darling of the Dao," Lu Changsheng said calmly, turning to look at Han Jinlong.</p><p></p><p>Han Jinlong regained his composure and sighed, "Young friend Lu, you and I are both from the human race, so naturally we will speak up for our own tribe. But still..."</p><p></p><p>"But what?" Lu Changsheng asked softly.</p><p></p><p>"After attaining the Dao, all living beings in the heavens and earth, regardless of tribe, transform into human form..." </p><p></p><p>"Doesn't this say enough?"</p><p></p><p>Boom!</p><p></p><p>At this moment, it was as if thunder had exploded in Han Jinlong's mind, and he slowly rose from his seat.</p><p></p><p>Ah, yes...</p><p></p><p>If he hadn't heard such shocking words today, who would have thought...</p><p></p><p>On the Divine-Demon Battlefield, the Myriad Tribes, except when in battle, almost all of them move about in human form.</p><p></p><p>Here is the full English translation of the Chinese excerpt:</p><p></p><p>Why is that? Is it really just because the human form is good for activity?</p><p></p><p>This is indeed a question worth deep contemplation.</p><p></p><p>Coupled with the human race's reproductive capacity that is a thousand, ten thousand times more terrifying than other races, they are indeed uniquely gifted.</p><p></p><p>After a moment, Han Jinlong cupped his hands and said, "Today, after hearing Senior Lü's words, this king... has gained quite a harvest."</p><p></p><p>He could only say that, even if what Senior Lü said was true, the current predicament of the human race does not allow them to indulge in too many fantasies.</p><p></p><p>Lü Changsheng smiled faintly and said, "The rise of the human race will begin with the Seven-Colored Glazed Pagoda."</p><p></p><p>Han Jinlong paused again, this Senior Lü truly spoke words that were startling, each sentence was so... </p><p></p><p>"Why is Senior Lü so certain?" Han Jinlong couldn't help but ask.</p><p></p><p>Lü Changsheng, however, shook his head and did not say anything further.</p><p></p><p>Seeing this, Han Jinlong felt as if there were ants crawling on him, feeling somewhat uncomfortable.</p><p></p><p>He slowly sat down, just wanting to pour himself a cup of wine, but suddenly remembered the main matter, and then asked in a solemn voice:</p><p></p><p>"Senior Lü, the reason I came here today is actually to invite you to participate in the Seven-Colored Glazed Pagoda, I wonder if..."</p><p></p><p>"Okay." Lü Changsheng nodded slightly.</p><p></p><p>A smile appeared on Han Jinlong's face, and the weight on his heart was lifted.</p><p></p><p>As long as Senior Lü agreed to participate in the Seven-Colored Glazed Pagoda, then he would be considered one of the people of the Human City from now on.</p><p></p><p>Han Jinlong seemed to have thought of something, his brow slightly furrowed, and he said, "Because the Human City only has three spots, when the time comes, I will announce it throughout the city, and the three fellows on the battle ranking... no, it should be the one ranked third, that little guy Zhao Di, will definitely come looking for you, and I need to help you..."</p><p></p><p>Lü Changsheng interrupted, "No need, let him come if he wants to."</p><p></p><p>Han Jinlong nodded in satisfaction, and then smiled again, "Senior Lü, in my perception, your cultivation seems to be even stronger than the one ranked first on the battle ranking, when Zhao Di comes looking for you, as fellow members of the human race, I hope you will go easy on him..."</p><p></p><p>"Mm, it's fine, you can leave now, I need to rest." </p><p></p><p>Lü Changsheng said and then lay down on the bed, closing his eyes.</p><p></p><p>Han Jinlong paused.</p><p></p><p>As the ruler of the people, when has he ever been treated this way... Except for the other four rulers, who dares?</p><p></p><p>For some reason, towards this Senior Lü in front of him, Han Jinlong really couldn't muster the majesty of a ruler, and he didn't know what the problem was, he also felt quite depressed in his heart.</p><p></p><p>"Then... Okay, Senior Lü, please rest well, I won't disturb you anymore."</p><p></p><p>Han Jinlong sighed and stood up, his gaze suddenly falling on the two jars of wine that were not finished, and he coughed dryly, "Senior Lü, these two jars of wine, you don't want them, right?"</p><p></p><p>Lü Changsheng's brow furrowed slightly, waving his hand as if shooing away a fly, "Take them away, take them away."</p><p></p><p>Han Jinlong was delighted, waving his hand to collect the two jars of wine, just about to leave, when he suddenly remembered something and asked, "Senior Lü, what is your name?"</p><p></p><p>It had to be a name for the city-wide announcement.</p><p></p><p>"Changsheng." Lü Changsheng said and then fell completely silent.</p><p></p><p>Changsheng?</p><p></p><p>Han Jinlong nodded, took a look at the young man in green, and disappeared from the room.</p><p></p><p>...</p><p></p><p>Two months later.</p><p></p><p>The news of the imminent opening of the Seven-Colored Glazed Pagoda swept across the Divine-Demon Battlefield!</p><p></p><p>All tribes began to make preparations!</p><p></p><p>And in the human race's domain, it was the same!</p><p></p><p>The three core cities of Heaven, Earth, and Human, issued announcements at the same time, and selected a total of nine Shenxuan Realm top-tier powerhouses to participate in the Seven-Colored Glazed Pagoda!</p><p></p><p>The selections for the Heaven City and Earth City were still fine, generally in line with everyone's expectations.</p><p></p><p>As for the Human City... it was in an uproar!</p><p></p><p>The first on the battle ranking, Mo Lianqiu.</p><p>The second on the battle ranking, Shui Tinghen.</p><p></p><p>These two seniors were not a problem, the problem was with the third one...</p><p></p><p>It was actually not the third-ranked Zhao Di senior, but the unknown Lü... Lü Changsheng?</p>

        <h1>Chapter 100</h1>
        <div class="content">
            <p>Here is the full English translation of the Chinese excerpt:</p><p></p><p>"You inspectors of the palace... how dare you!" </p><p></p><p>The man in the blue robe spoke calmly, but his voice resounded through the quiet square like a tiger's roar in the mountains. </p><p></p><p>Aside from Zhao Ling and the other four inspectors, the three great immortal clans and everyone else in the square were startled, staring in shock at the man in the blue robe casually walking towards the center.</p><p></p><p>In the past, it was always the Inspection Bureau who accused others of being audacious. </p><p></p><p>But today, someone was turning the tables and saying it was the Inspection Bureau... this was truly a first for them.</p><p></p><p>Chu Xiran and Zhang Youdao's faces were rigid, their eyes vacant, their entire bodies trembling uncontrollably...</p><p></p><p>The Immortal Emperor of the Immortal Realm, who had not been seen for twelve years, had reappeared...</p><p></p><p>And now he was casually approaching them.</p><p></p><p>Others may not know his identity and not feel any pressure, but Chu Xiran and Zhang Youdao were different!</p><p></p><p>They could feel their souls trembling!</p><p></p><p>The next moment, the two of them bent their knees and knelt heavily on the ground before the others' astonished gaze, not daring to lift their heads...</p><p></p><p>"Uh, young ladies, what are you doing?" </p><p></p><p>The Chu clan immortal asked in confusion.</p><p></p><p>Chu Xiran and Zhang Youdao did not respond, still kneeling submissively...</p><p></p><p>Chu Lang also looked at Chu Xiran and Zhang Youdao with surprise and doubt, and in the flicker of his gaze, it seemed he had recalled something, then made a certain connection...</p><p></p><p>This Zhang Youdao was the one Chu Xiran had brought back to the clan twelve years ago, on the very day the Great Eternal Sect was destroyed.</p><p></p><p>Chu Xiran and Zhang Youdao's strange behavior was obviously directed at this man in the blue robe...</p><p></p><p>This person had now boldly intervened and dared to provoke the Inspection Bureau...</p><p></p><p>Could it be that the destruction of the Great Eternal Sect twelve years ago was related to him?!</p><p></p><p>The attention of the countless people present was mainly focused on Lu Changsheng and the old turtle, and they paid little heed to Chu Xiran and Zhang Youdao's behavior, thinking they must know this person and have some background.</p><p></p><p>But no matter what background they had, could it be greater than that of the Inspection Bureau?</p><p></p><p>Soon, Lu Changsheng arrived at the center, stopping in front of the three clan leaders of the Chu clan, standing with his hands behind his back.</p><p></p><p>The old turtle stood half a step behind Lu Changsheng, arms crossed, squinting his eyes, his feet tapping.</p><p></p><p>Your grandpa turtle, infinitely arrogant.</p><p></p><p>At least in terms of aura control, the old turtle knew what he was doing.</p><p></p><p>In the Spiritual Dust Realm, he might not dare to bully the small, but now that he was in the Immortal Realm, it was different - although they were still ants, they had grown much fatter!</p><p></p><p>And these ants... were quite arrogant.</p><p></p><p>The three Chu clan leaders exchanged glances, their hearts racing as they eyed the figure in front of them... Although they did not know the specific purpose of this person, it was obvious that he had come to provoke the Inspection Bureau.</p><p></p><p>The enemy of my enemy is my friend!</p><p></p><p>If this man in the blue robe had the strength of a Sixth-Grade Immortal Sage, then today, by joining forces with him, they might even be able to compete with the five inspectors!</p><p></p><p>Zhao Ling narrowed her eyes, observing Lu Changsheng, and after examining him, she couldn't help but furrow her brow, saying puzzledly,</p><p></p><p>"In this Soaring Immortal Continent, you are the first one to speak so boldly against the Inspection Bureau, as far as I know."</p><p></p><p>Lu Changsheng did not respond, only saying indifferently,</p><p></p><p>"I was the one who destroyed the Great Eternal Sect."</p><p></p><p>Boom!</p><p></p><p>A single stone had stirred up a thousand waves! </p><p></p><p>The entire square erupted in an uproar, all staring unbelievably at the man in the blue robe in the center.</p><p></p><p>The sound of swallowing saliva echoed all around!</p><p></p><p>Although the words sounded like a fairy tale, given the current situation, there was no room for them to doubt it.</p><p></p><p>Here is the full English translation of the Chinese excerpt:</p><p></p><p>Unbelievable!</p><p></p><p>New 69 Book Bar ‚Üí 69shuùíô.ùíÑùíêùíé</p><p></p><p>"Uh." Huang Zhong and Chen He were dumbfounded.</p><p></p><p>Only Chu Lang's eyes were shining with a brilliant light!!</p><p></p><p>If the Tianhe Sect was truly destroyed by the senior in blue, then today, these five Inspection Commissioners definitely won't get away with it!</p><p></p><p>That's right, in just a moment, Lu Changsheng's position in Chu Lang's heart changed from the young man in blue to the senior in blue.</p><p></p><p>Zhao Ling and the other four Inspection Commissioners were also stunned for a moment.</p><p></p><p>The appearance of the culprit was too sudden, and they couldn't quite react to it.</p><p></p><p>"What kind of joke are you talking about......"</p><p></p><p>Zhao Ling suppressed her slightly stiff expression and said coldly.</p><p></p><p>She also wanted to deal with this hateful young man directly, but in the absence of knowing the other party's depth and the truth of the matter, she didn't dare to act rashly.</p><p></p><p>At this moment,</p><p></p><p>Lu Changsheng clasped his hands together and said with a faint smile: "Since I am the 'culprit' who destroyed the Tianhe Sect, quickly bind me up."</p><p></p><p>The atmosphere on the square fell into an eerie silence, and at this point, no one could see through Lu Changsheng's thoughts.</p><p></p><p>Time passed, second by second, and Zhao Ling remained silent.</p><p></p><p>The other four Inspection Commissioners also stood like wooden statues, waiting for Zhao Ling's orders, but it was not difficult to see their nervousness!</p><p></p><p>This eerie young man in blue, with his carefree smile on his face, made their pressure rise sharply!</p><p></p><p>"The real 'culprit' is in front of you, but you don't dare to bind him, and instead bind some innocent people, how capable you are..."</p><p></p><p>Lu Changsheng lowered his hands and said meaningfully.</p><p></p><p>Zhao Ling's face changed slightly, but before she could say anything...</p><p></p><p>Lu Changsheng gently struck out a palm!!</p><p></p><p>Boom!!!</p><p></p><p>The four Inspection Commissioners around Zhao Ling suddenly exploded into a bloody mist! Without any forewarning!</p><p></p><p>Immediately afterwards, Lu Changsheng's black pupils flashed!</p><p></p><p>The still dazed Zhao Ling flew towards him, finally hovering about a zhang (3.3 meters) in front of Lu Changsheng!</p><p></p><p>Restraint!</p><p></p><p>Zhao Ling's body became completely stiff, and her face turned deathly pale!</p><p></p><p>Because she couldn't resist at all...</p><p></p><p>She looked at Lu Changsheng's eyes, and finally her gaze turned to fear!!</p><p></p><p>All of this happened in an instant! It was simply too fast for anyone to react!</p><p></p><p>Everyone's minds were shaken, feeling dizzy...</p><p></p><p>The five Inspection Commissioners, three Second-Grade Golden Immortals, and one Third-Grade Golden Immortal mysteriously exploded into a bloody mist.</p><p></p><p>Even the leader, the Eighth-Grade Golden Immortal, seemed to be bound by some mysterious power in midair, at the mercy of others!</p><p></p><p>They were now completely convinced that the Tianhe Sect was destroyed by this senior.</p><p></p><p>Because... the Sect Master of the Tianhe Sect was only an Eighth-Grade Golden Immortal, after all.</p><p></p><p>Zhao Ling's lips turned purple, and she trembled in fear, but she still growled in terror, "Do you know what the consequences are for opposing the Inspection Commissioners?!"</p><p></p><p>Lu Changsheng seemed to have not heard her, no longer bothering to respond, and with a flash of blue light in his pupils, Zhao Ling's memories were instantly seized by him!</p><p></p><p>"Ah!" Zhao Ling let out a miserable scream.</p><p></p><p>Hearing this, everyone's hair stood on end!</p><p></p><p>"No, no, don't kill me, senior, sir! My father is a Silver-Ranked Inspection Commissioner, and my grandfather is even... Please spare my life..." Zhao Ling trembled as she pleaded for her life, struggling to endure the excruciating pain in her mind.</p><p></p><p>She knew all too well what would happen to her after her mind was searched.</p><p></p><p>This was something she often did to others, and she was all too familiar with it.</p><p></p><p>She didn't want to die!</p><p></p><p>Lu Changsheng's face was expressionless, and he turned and left indifferently.</p><p></p><p>In the moment he turned, the Zhao Ling who was still begging for her life suddenly let out a muffled "bang" and exploded into a bloody mist!</p><p></p><p>Her death was no different from the four Inspection Commissioners earlier.</p><p></p><p>The square was swept by a cold wind, and everyone stared blankly at the young man in blue, their pupils frantically contracting and dilating, in an endless loop.</p>

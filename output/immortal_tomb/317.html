        <h1>Chapter 317</h1>
        <div class="content">
            <p>Here is the full English translation of the Chinese excerpt:</p><p></p><p>"Hmm?" The nearby Liu Tu and the others looked over with puzzlement, only to see Fu Shiyu's expression become stiff.</p><p></p><p>"Shiyu?" Fu Liancai asked with some concern.</p><p></p><p>Fu Shiyu snapped out of it, let out a bitter laugh, and transmitted a message to Liu Ye Ye, Liu Shu, and his father: "Grandpa Liu, Uncle Liu, Father, do you still remember the day when Shiyu, Xiao Tao, and I brought Senior Lu to Jingyu City?"</p><p></p><p>Hearing Lu Changsheng's name, everyone's expressions became tense.</p><p></p><p>"Father, didn't I tell you that day that when I went to collect the Xukong Mushroom, I encountered a mysterious strong expert who was confronting the Heavenly Dao?" Fu Shiyu said in a low voice.</p><p></p><p>Fu Liancai was taken aback, and Fu Tao's face finally turned pale as he belatedly realized.</p><p></p><p>Liu Tu and Liu Qing also seemed to understand, their lips trembling.</p><p></p><p>Could it be that the culprit behind all of this today was... Oh no, the cause was actually...</p><p></p><p>Fu Shiyu said hoarsely, "There are no such coincidences in the world, it should be Lu, Senior Lu..."</p><p></p><p>Although they had guessed it, the hearts of Liu Tu and the others still skipped a beat.</p><p></p><p>Liu Tu took a deep breath and quickly said in a low voice, "Shiyu, you can't say such things casually, we haven't heard anything..."</p><p></p><p>"Yes, yes, yes, we haven't heard anything!"</p><p></p><p>Fu Liancai and Liu Qing frantically nodded their heads, also pretending not to have heard.</p><p></p><p>The current situation was that the Heavenly Dao Origin had caused a mess, and was now troubling the Eight Great, no, Seven Great Ancient Clans.</p><p></p><p>It would be better for them to pretend not to know about this top-level expert's game and conflicts.</p><p></p><p>Fu Shiyu's expression stiffened, and he laughed awkwardly, "I was just talking nonsense."</p><p></p><p>...</p><p></p><p>The powerful experts of the Seven Great Ancient Clans from various regions were all stunned after hearing the Heavenly Dao Origin's words.</p><p></p><p>Since they had little interaction with each other in their respective domains, and it was difficult to contact and confront each other at the moment, they all thought that it must be one of the clans secretly fighting the Heavenly Dao!</p><p></p><p>This made sense, no wonder the Heavenly Dao was causing trouble today.</p><p></p><p>Although they had grievances and rivalries among the Eight Great Ancient Clans, they had always been united against the Heavenly Dao.</p><p></p><p>Immediately, the powerful expert of the Burning Wolf Clan from the Crimson Flame Heavens activated a thread of Dao Technique, looking at the yin-yang abnormal sky and said:</p><p></p><p>"Heavenly Dao Lord, your words are a bit laughable. What, haven't you killed some of our Eight Great Ancient Clans' people? Aren't we allowed to exterminate some of your Heavenly Dao?"</p><p></p><p>The powerful expert of the Sky Demon Clan from the chaotic Demon Sea region of the Eternal Celestial Realm also coldly laughed and said:</p><p></p><p>"Hehe, it's just a small skirmish, Heavenly Dao Lord. Your actions today have really lost some face, you know?"</p><p></p><p>As for the other six Ancient Clan experts, they remained silent.</p><p></p><p>The conversation between the Heavenly Dao Origin and the Ancient Clans could be heard by everyone in the Eternal Celestial Realm.</p><p></p><p>This was naturally done intentionally by the Ancient Clans. Since the Heavenly Dao was provoking them in front of all living beings, they had to adopt a strong attitude, lest they be seen as afraid of the Heavenly Dao!</p><p></p><p>They had always believed that their Eight Great Ancient Clans were the absolute overlords of the Eternal Celestial Realm, and that this Heavenly Dao was just a bystander.</p><p></p><p>The Heavenly Dao Origin seemed to fall silent for a moment.</p><p></p><p>...</p><p></p><p>On the edge of the Moon Star Domain,</p><p></p><p>Lu Changsheng stood quietly, holding a gourd and taking occasional sips.</p><p></p><p>Whether it was the Heavenly Dao or the Ancient Clans, he had grievances with both.</p><p></p><p>Now that the two sides had clashed, it could save him a lot of effort, and he could just watch the show, which was quite enjoyable.</p><p></p><p>He was in a good mood at the moment, and it could be said that he had inadvertently created this situation.</p><p></p><p>It all started from when he destroyed the Ancestral Heavenly God Realm of the Heavenly Dao.</p><p></p><p>Here is the full English translation of the excerpt from the Chinese novel:</p><p></p><p>Looking at it now, that Heavenly Dao was really worth being destroyed.</p><p></p><p>Li Shuyan and Blood Demon stood silently behind, daring not to speak.</p><p></p><p>Li Shuyan knew that the five Boundless Heavenly Daos were actually destroyed by the Master, after all, he was standing by the Master's side at the time, watching the Master slash out that sword!</p><p></p><p>As for Blood Demon, she knew nothing, she knew that her Master seemed to be in a good mood at the moment.</p><p></p><p>"Normally it may be just a small skirmish, but this time the slaughter of five Middle World-level Boundless Heavenly Daos is also just a small skirmish?" </p><p></p><p>The words of the Heavenly Dao Origin of the Eternal Realm could not help but reveal a trace of anger.</p><p></p><p>These ancient clans are really arrogant without end!</p><p></p><p>It admits that it is powerless against these ancient clans, even though it is the Heavenly Dao Origin of the Eternal Realm.</p><p></p><p>It is now talking to the eight ancient clans, actually just wanting the eight ancient clans to sincerely apologize in front of the world!</p><p></p><p>Otherwise, when the two Heavenly Dao Lords arrive, there is a high probability that a conflict will break out!</p><p></p><p>It had heard a cold tone in the words of the two Heavenly Dao Lords before, and this time the Heavenly Dao Lords are different from before, they are really angry, and this time it will not be so simple.</p><p></p><p>It does not want the two Heavenly Dao Lords and these ancient clans to fight in the Eternal Realm.</p><p></p><p>Because if that happens, the Eternal Realm will definitely not be able to withstand it, and as the Heavenly Dao Origin of the Eternal Realm, the one who will suffer the greatest loss in the end will be it...</p><p></p><p>The powerful experts of the seven ancient clans were slightly silent, they did not deny it, after all, those were five Middle World-level Boundless Heavenly Daos.</p><p></p><p>However, they could not bow their heads to the Heavenly Dao, if they bowed their heads, in the future the status of their ancient clans in the hearts of the living beings in the Eternal Realm would definitely decline greatly.</p><p></p><p>At this moment, the world had become quiet, and everyone was listening carefully, not daring to miss a single word.</p><p></p><p>"If you sincerely apologize, this matter will be considered over."</p><p></p><p>At this time, the voice of the Heavenly Dao Origin sounded again.</p><p></p><p>"Absurd, a mere five Middle World-level Boundless Heavenly Daos want us ancient clans to apologize? I, the Void Ancient Beast Clan King, will set an example and disagree."</p><p></p><p>"The Blazing Wolf Clan disagrees."</p><p></p><p>"The Ancient Moon Blood Clan disagrees."</p><p></p><p>"The Jiang Clan disagrees."</p><p></p><p>"The Demon Clan disagrees."</p><p></p><p>"The Ancient Saint Clan disagrees."</p><p></p><p>"I, the Nine-Winged Desert Beast Clan, also disagree."</p><p></p><p>"......"</p><p></p><p>The sky was silent for a moment, and the powerful experts of the ancient clans all frowned, looking towards the Ancient Desolate Abyss region with displeasure!</p><p></p><p>What about the Ancient Desolate Sword Clan? Why didn't anyone take the lead? Have they gone mute?</p><p></p><p>It's impossible that the Ancient Desolate Sword Clan is afraid, right?</p><p></p><p>After all, the overall strength of the Ancient Desolate Sword Clan is among the top in these eight ancient clans, only second to the Void Ancient Beast Clan and the Ancient Saint Clan, how could they be afraid!</p><p></p><p>"Jian Cang! What's the situation with your Ancient Desolate Sword Clan?" The bald elder of the Ancient Saint Clan couldn't help but frown and ask towards the direction of the Ancient Desolate Abyss.</p><p></p><p>At the same time,</p><p></p><p>In the remote areas of the Ancient Desolate Abyss, there were some cultivators who had not received the news and were dumbfounded.</p><p></p><p>Only Duan Jiu Xiong, Miu Han Tian and other powerful experts, as well as many cultivators who knew the truth of the matter, were sweating on their foreheads.</p><p></p><p>If their strength and status allowed it, they really wanted to tell those ancient clans:</p><p></p><p>Stop shouting, the Ancient Desolate Sword Clan has already gone.</p><p></p><p>"Hehe hehe hehe——"</p><p></p><p>At this moment, the Heavenly Dao Origin laughed coldly, it seemed to have looked at the edge of the Moon Star Domain and the figure in blue, with a grave look in its eyes.</p><p></p><p>Regarding the abnormality of the Heavenly Dao, the powerful experts of the ancient clans were puzzled, to be honest, although it was a cold laugh, this was the first time they had heard the Heavenly Dao laugh.</p><p></p><p>But the next words that the Heavenly Dao uttered made their minds shake.</p><p></p><p>"Stop shouting, the Ancient Desolate Sword Clan has already... been destroyed."</p>

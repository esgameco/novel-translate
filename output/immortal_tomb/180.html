        <h1>Chapter 180</h1>
        <div class="content">
            <p>Here is the full English translation of the Chinese excerpt:</p><p></p><p>The Black Abyss Domain, the Black Demonic City. ‚ôîüíã‚ûÖÔºôùêíƒ§«óùê±.·ëïùê®–ºüíòüí•</p><p></p><p>In the Lord's Palace of the Black Abyss Domain,</p><p></p><p>Lu Changsheng followed Xing Tian as they walked towards a certain place.</p><p></p><p>Xing Tian's footsteps were a bit hurried, indicating his inner urgency.</p><p></p><p>Lu Changsheng casually asked with a smile, "What is your beloved daughter's name?"</p><p></p><p>Xing Tian's footsteps suddenly slowed down, realizing he had lost his composure. He then slightly bowed and replied with a smile, "Senior Lu, she takes her mother's surname, and her name is He Xitong."</p><p></p><p>Lu Changsheng nodded slightly without saying anything else.</p><p></p><p>Soon, the two arrived at a palace.</p><p></p><p>Lu Changsheng swept a glance at the palace, noticing that Xing Tian had placed a layer of seal on it. Without any doubt, this seal was quite powerful, and it would be difficult for anyone in the Heavenly Scar to break it.</p><p></p><p>Except for him, of course.</p><p></p><p>Xing Tian waved his hand, and the seal disappeared. He then made an inviting gesture, his eyes full of hope, "Senior Lu, please."</p><p></p><p>Lu Changsheng nodded and stepped in, with Xing Tian closely following behind.</p><p></p><p>Upon entering the palace, a refreshing fragrance immediately wafted into their nostrils. Lu Changsheng scanned the luxurious decorations, and his gaze finally settled on a ice bed in the center, which was emitting a white mist.</p><p></p><p>On the ice bed, there was a stunningly beautiful woman lying quietly, her hands placed on her abdomen, her eyes closed, and her brows slightly furrowed.</p><p></p><p>"Senior Lu, Tong'er, she..." Xing Tian's face turned slightly pale, and he seemed deeply pained.</p><p></p><p>Lu Changsheng gently waved his hand, then stepped up to the ice bed, his eyes fixed on the woman. There was no surprise or astonishment in his gaze.</p><p></p><p>This woman, could she be the same little Tong from the Lingchen Realm in the past? However, compared to the pure and simple little Tong from the Lingchen Realm, this woman on the ice bed was dressed in an exquisite phoenix robe, exuding a graceful and elegant aura.</p><p></p><p>Lu Changsheng tilted his head and asked, "How long has your beloved daughter been in this state?"</p><p></p><p>Xing Tian immediately replied, "Tong'er has been in this state for almost three million years..."</p><p></p><p>Lu Changsheng's eyes flickered, "You mentioned the Rebirth Flower before, and I know there is a place with an abundance of them."</p><p></p><p>Xing Tian's body suddenly trembled, and his eyes shone with a glimmer of hope!</p><p></p><p>"However..." Lu Changsheng suddenly turned around and looked at him, speaking softly, "However, the Rebirth Flower will not only fail to help your beloved daughter, but it will also harm her."</p><p></p><p>This unexpected turn of events left Xing Tian momentarily at a loss for words. He stammered, "Senior, could you please tell me why?"</p><p></p><p>Lu Changsheng walked towards the exit of the palace, asking as he went, "Do you know the reason behind your beloved daughter's current condition?"</p><p></p><p>Xing Tian glanced at the ice bed where He Xitong lay, then quickly followed Lu Changsheng. "Senior, I don't know. Three million years ago, Tong'er suddenly fell into this state."</p><p></p><p>After Xing Tian had placed the seal on the palace, Lu Changsheng said, "Her condition is something that cannot be cured by any means in the world, because... this is not something that can be interfered with by others."</p><p></p><p>"..." Xing Tian was perplexed.</p><p></p><p>"This is a Myriad Worlds Tribulation, and she must overcome it on her own." Lu Changsheng smiled as he brushed his long hair.</p><p></p><p>Myriad Worlds Tribulation? Xing Tian was even more confused. Although he considered himself experienced, he had never heard of this "Myriad Worlds Tribulation" before.</p><p></p><p>But the literal meaning was clear to him.</p><p></p><p>He did not doubt the truth of Lu Changsheng's words, for he knew that Lu Changsheng's abilities and knowledge were far beyond his own.</p><p></p><p>Xing Tian then respectfully asked, "Senior Lu, does this Myriad Worlds Tribulation take place in the realm of dreams?"</p><p></p><p>"No," Lu Changsheng shook his head and said, "The Myriad Worlds Tribulation is real."</p><p></p><p>Real?! Xing Tian was stunned.</p><p></p><p>But Tong'er's body has been under his protection all this time!</p><p></p><p>Lu Changsheng did not bother to explain Xing Tian's bewilderment and continued, "More than 1,400 years ago, I once encountered a little Tong in a small world called the Lingchen Realm..."</p><p></p><p>Here is the full English translation of the Chinese excerpt:</p><p></p><p>She."</p><p></p><p>Xin69shu.com</p><p></p><p>Xing Tian: "..."</p><p></p><p>For some unknown reason, Xing Tian suddenly felt a chill down his spine.</p><p></p><p>"Senior, Xing Tian..."</p><p></p><p>Soon, Xing Tian regained his composure and looked at Lu Changsheng with hope.</p><p></p><p>Lu Changsheng naturally knew what he meant, so he snapped his fingers and transmitted the scenes about Xiao Tong in the Spiritual Dust Realm to Xing Tian's mind.</p><p></p><p>After a moment,</p><p></p><p>"Tong'er, I never imagined she would have such a difficult life." Xing Tian opened his eyes, with a mix of pity and fear in them. He looked at Lu Changsheng and deeply bowed, gratefully saying, "Senior... thank you for saving Tong'er's life."</p><p></p><p>"When one is in the midst of a calamity spanning a myriad of eras, if one's physical body dies unexpectedly or the original power is misused, then the main body you are protecting will also perish, except for a natural death. However, those who can traverse a myriad of eras must have great fortune on their side, and they are not so easily killed."</p><p></p><p>Lu Changsheng shook his head and chuckled,</p><p></p><p>"If it were that easy to die, then it wouldn't take a myriad of eras, a mere hundred would be enough to let them die beyond death."</p><p></p><p>In the Spiritual Dust Realm, He Xitong and her grandmother were in dire straits, and she was about to misuse her original power. If not for Lu Changsheng's intervention, she would have died then, and Xing Tian's original body here would have died as well.</p><p></p><p>But it is true that those who traverse a myriad of eras are accompanied by great fortune.</p><p></p><p>It can be said that in the Spiritual Dust Realm, Lu Changsheng was He Xitong's greatest fortune!</p><p></p><p>Everything started from those few baskets of fruit and the five significant copper coins.</p><p></p><p>"Xing Tian understands." Xing Tian bowed again, as he had never shown such respect to anyone before, not even in the Ancestral Heavenly Realm.</p><p></p><p>"Senior, so... Tong'er can only awaken when she has traversed the myriad of eras, right?" Xing Tian asked with a pursed lip.</p><p></p><p>"Correct, in terms of time, it's hard to calculate precisely, because each of her lives is different, whether it's a mortal with a lifespan of less than a hundred, a mayfly with a lifespan of only a day, or even a stone, until it is weathered away, one life is considered complete."</p><p></p><p>Lu Changsheng said softly.</p><p></p><p>Xing Tian understood, turned to look at the resting chamber, and sighed deeply, "I hope Tong'er can safely traverse this myriad of eras..."</p><p></p><p>"Since it's a physical traversal of the calamity, who knows, you might one day encounter her. But if she's in a form other than human, you may not recognize her, and she won't recognize you either." Lu Changsheng chuckled.</p><p></p><p>A smile appeared on Xing Tian's weathered face, as if he had envisioned that scene, and he murmured with a smile, "From now on, I'll be more mindful when dealing with all things, you never know, that might be Tong'er."</p><p></p><p>Seeing that Xing Tian didn't ask why He Xitong had to traverse the myriad of eras, Lu Changsheng didn't bother to explain further. He said, "Just let things take their course. Since the matter is resolved, I should be on my way."</p><p></p><p>Xing Tian made a solemn bow: "I thank the senior for the clarification. Now that everything is clear, I shall immediately take Tong'er back to the Ancestral Heavenly Realm."</p><p></p><p>"Mm." Lu Changsheng nodded.</p><p></p><p>Xing Tian took a deep breath, abruptly breaking the seal he had just placed, and the ice bed flew out of the resting chamber, which he then stored in his personal space.</p><p></p><p>He then looked at Lu Changsheng and smiled, "Senior... if you have the time, please come visit the Ancestral Heavenly Realm. I do have some standing there."</p><p></p><p>"I will go." Lu Changsheng replied with a gentle smile.</p><p></p><p>"Senior, until we meet again!" Xing Tian said cheerfully, and then suddenly disappeared.</p><p></p><p>After a moment,</p><p></p><p>Lu Changsheng's lips curled up, and he feigned surprise, "Ah, I forgot to have him take care of the old turtle and the others... oh well, a little more tempering won't hurt."</p><p></p><p>He then stepped into the void and vanished, murmuring,</p><p></p><p>"I'll go play in the Extremely Secluded Forest."</p>

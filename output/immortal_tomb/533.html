        <h1>Chapter 533</h1>
        <div class="content">
            <p>Here is the full English translation of the Chinese excerpt:</p><p></p><p>Evening.</p><p></p><p>Cao Yulong, holding a large bag in his left hand and leading Cao Boyu with his right hand, walked towards the Changsheng Academy.</p><p></p><p>"Boyu, when you see Mr. Lu, you must perform well. If Mr. Lu still refuses to take you in, you will be destined for mediocrity for the rest of your life!" Cao Yulong sighed.</p><p></p><p>"Father, it is my own incompetence. I do not possess the martial bloodline, so I cannot earn Mr. Lu's appreciation," Cao Boyu said dejectedly.</p><p></p><p>Cao Yulong was silent for a moment, then pursed his lips: "It's not your fault, I have set my expectations for you too high, after all, it's mostly about saving face."</p><p></p><p>The main reason was Huang Yulang's son, Huang Xuan, which made Cao Yulong feel quite uneasy.</p><p></p><p>Not only did he gain Mr. Lu's appreciation, but he also possessed a rare earth martial bloodline, with even the Heaven Martial Sect vying to recruit him. Sigh... In comparison, it made Cao Yulong, the lord of the town, feel imbalanced.</p><p></p><p>It's not that Cao Yulong was overly jealous, but the reality was just too painful.</p><p></p><p>"Boyu, don't put too much pressure on yourself. If Mr. Lu really doesn't want to take you in, I won't blame you even if you end up living an ordinary life."</p><p></p><p>Cao Boyu tightened his grip on Cao Yulong's hand and silently nodded.</p><p></p><p>Soon, the two arrived at the Changsheng Academy, but the gates were tightly closed.</p><p></p><p>"Greetings, Lord Cao! Greetings, Young Master Boyu!" </p><p></p><p>Passersby who saw Cao Yulong and Cao Boyu hurriedly greeted them.</p><p></p><p>"Haha, everyone, please don't stand on ceremony!" Cao Yulong smiled and then took the opportunity to ask, "Why is the Changsheng Academy closed? Is Mr. Lu not here? Does anyone know?"</p><p></p><p>Most people shook their heads, but someone quickly said, "Lord Cao, Mr. Lu should be fishing outside the town!"</p><p></p><p>This person was the same customer who had drunk fish soup at Old Xu's noodle shop earlier that day. </p><p></p><p>At the time, it was said that Mr. Lu had made an appointment with Old Xu to go fishing together.</p><p></p><p>Today, Old Xu had also closed his shop early, so he had most likely gone fishing with Mr. Lu.</p><p></p><p>Otherwise, Old Xu wouldn't have closed his shop so early... </p><p></p><p>Tonight, people who wanted to eat noodles couldn't.</p><p></p><p>"Oh? Fishing?" Cao Yulong looked in the direction of the town outskirts, then at the sky, and had to give up.</p><p></p><p>It was already late, and it wouldn't be good to disturb Mr. Lu's fishing.</p><p></p><p>"Boyu, we'll come back tomorrow."</p><p></p><p>"Yes."</p><p></p><p>...</p><p></p><p>At the lake outside the town.</p><p></p><p>Lu Changsheng and Old Xu were sitting there leisurely, watching the float on the water.</p><p></p><p>"Old Xu, you're not doing business tonight, is that okay?" Lu Changsheng fixed the rod and ate some fruit, smiling.</p><p></p><p>Old Xu stared intently at the float and hurriedly said, "Mr. Lu, don't worry, it's just one night off from business, no problem at all!"</p><p></p><p>Lu Changsheng nodded slightly, "You seem unfamiliar, is this your first time fishing?"</p><p></p><p>Hearing this, Old Xu's old face flushed red as he stammered, "Mr. Lu's keen eyes, indeed, this is Old Xu's first time fishing..."</p><p></p><p>In the past, he had been so busy with his business that he never had time for the leisurely activity of fishing.</p><p></p><p>Lu Changsheng heard this and smiled mysteriously, not saying anything more.</p><p></p><p>Suddenly, Old Xu's float moved and then quickly sank!</p><p></p><p>"It, it's a bite! Mr. Lu, I've got a bite!!" </p><p></p><p>Old Xu was startled and quickly stood up from his seat, excitedly pulling the fishing rod.</p><p></p><p>Lu Changsheng stood up from his seat and came over, smiling, "Don't be hasty, this is when you need to be calm."</p><p></p><p>Old Xu was puzzled. The fish had already taken the bait, why shouldn't he hurry and pull it out?!</p><p></p><p>"Haha, fishing has its own techniques, Old Xu. Now, do as I say." Lu Changsheng said.</p><p></p><p>Old Xu nodded solemnly, his flushed face visible even in the darkness.</p><p></p><p>"Maintain your balance, gently shake the tip of the rod, this will make the hook grip the fish more firmly, yes, that's it."</p><p></p><p>At this time, the fish in the water was struggling more violently!</p><p></p><p>Old Xu was starting to lose his balance, his heart racing, as this was the first fish of his life!</p><p></p><p>Lu Changsheng smiled and said, "If the fish is struggling too hard, you can loosen the line a bit. If you pull the rod too hard, the fish may escape."</p><p></p><p>Old Xu hurriedly did as instructed!</p><p></p><p>Sure enough, he found it much easier now.</p><p></p><p>"Next, you need to be patient and let the fish tire itself out. When it stops struggling, that's when you can start reeling it in. Remember to reel the rod straight up."</p><p></p><p>Here is the full English translation of the Chinese novel excerpt:</p><p></p><p>"Lu Changsheng continued," said Lu Changsheng.</p><p></p><p>Old Xu nodded heavily, his eyes shining with the excitement of a hunter!</p><p></p><p>When the fish stopped struggling, he suddenly pulled the rod, but was embarrassed to find that he couldn't pull it!</p><p></p><p>He quickly looked at Lu Changsheng, his eyes pleading for help!</p><p></p><p>"Haha, Old Xu, it seems this fish is quite big! Come, let me help you with the net."</p><p></p><p>Lu Changsheng smiled and picked up the net, squatting down by the edge.</p><p></p><p>Old Xu immediately understood, and then carefully guided the fish towards Lu Changsheng.</p><p></p><p>Soon, a large fish was scooped up in Lu Changsheng's net and moved to the shore, allowing Old Xu to remove the hook.</p><p></p><p>Old Xu excitedly stroked the large fish with both hands, flinching a little as the fish occasionally jumped.</p><p></p><p>Lu Changsheng praised, "This fish is much larger than the one I caught earlier today. Old Xu, you're truly a fishing prodigy, amazing!"</p><p></p><p>Old Xu chuckled, "Mr. Lu, you're too kind. It's mainly because you taught me well!"</p><p></p><p>Then he patted his chest and said, "Mr. Lu, Old Xu has learned fishing!"</p><p></p><p>"Mm, good, keep fishing."</p><p></p><p>Lu Changsheng smiled slightly and returned to his seat.</p><p></p><p>Old Xu carefully placed the precious fish in the net and submerged it in the water, continuing to fish diligently.</p><p></p><p>What happened next was quite strange.</p><p></p><p>On Lu Changsheng's side, the float didn't move at all.</p><p></p><p>But on Old Xu's side, the big fish kept coming one after another, making him unable to close his mouth from smiling!</p><p></p><p>Whenever Old Xu caught a fish, Lu Changsheng would be the first to praise him.</p><p></p><p>Under Lu Changsheng's constant praise, Old Xu felt that his fishing skills had become unrivaled in the world.</p><p></p><p>Suddenly, Old Xu noticed that Lu Changsheng hadn't caught a single fish so far tonight, so he comforted, "Mr. Lu, don't be discouraged. You'll catch fish. Maybe the fish know that Old Xu is a first-time fisherman, so they're taking it easy on me, hehe."</p><p></p><p>"Ah." Lu Changsheng sighed in feigned distress.</p><p></p><p>Seeing this, Old Xu felt bad and said, "Mr. Lu, maybe the spot I'm fishing is better. How about we switch places so you can also have some fun!"</p><p></p><p>While he was catching fish one after another, Mr. Lu's side was still empty, and Old Xu felt guilty about it.</p><p></p><p>"Okay, let's switch then."</p><p></p><p>Lu Changsheng smiled and got up to change positions with Old Xu.</p><p></p><p>But then,</p><p></p><p>"Ah? I caught a fish!!"</p><p></p><p>Old Xu caught another fish.</p><p></p><p>After that, Old Xu kept catching fish, while Lu Changsheng, who had switched spots with him, still couldn't get a single bite.</p><p></p><p>"Strange, strange, Mr. Lu!" </p><p></p><p>Although Old Xu was excited, he didn't want to show it too much, so he could only express his puzzlement.</p><p></p><p>"It's fine, Old Xu. That you can catch fish makes me happier than if I could catch them myself. You really are a fishing genius."</p><p></p><p>Lu Changsheng seemed to have accepted it, and then remarked,</p><p></p><p>"Old Xu, it's getting late. Let's go back, we can fish again tomorrow."</p><p></p><p>"Okay, okay, okay!" Although Old Xu was reluctant, he quickly agreed.</p><p></p><p>After that, he took one last wistful look at the lake, then happily shouldered a large net full of fish and followed Lu Changsheng, who was carrying the fishing gear, into the night.</p><p></p><p>...</p><p></p><p>The next morning.</p><p></p><p>After arranging the morning reading for his three students, Lu Changsheng came out wanting to have breakfast.</p><p></p><p>Then he saw a crowd waiting in front of Old Xu's noodle shop.</p><p></p><p>Lu Changsheng's eyes flickered as he curiously approached, "Huh? Has Old Xu not opened yet? I was hoping to have some noodles this morning."</p><p></p><p>The crowd, seeing it was Lu Changsheng, quickly greeted him respectfully. After the greetings, they began to lament:</p><p></p><p>"That's right, Mr. Lu. We don't know what Old Xu is up to. He's usually open by this time, and we've already missed a few rounds of business!"</p><p></p><p>"Ah, that Old Xu, not even running his business anymore?"</p><p></p><p>"Ugh, my stomach is about to be flattened. I love eating noodles in the morning!"</p><p></p><p>"......"</p><p></p><p>Hearing this, Lu Changsheng glanced mysteriously towards the outskirts of the town, then cleared his throat and headed towards the steamed bun shop.</p>

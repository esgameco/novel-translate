        <h1>Chapter 39</h1>
        <div class="content">
            <p>Here is the full English translation of the Chinese excerpt:</p><p></p><p>The First Year. ·É¶(¬Ø`‚óï‚Äø‚óï¬¥¬Ø) ‚ô´ ‚ô™ ‚ô´ ‚ùª‚ùæùìàùíΩùêî–ñ.œÇœÉùî™ ‚ô´ ‚ô™ ‚ô´ (¬Ø`‚óï‚Äø‚óï¬¥¬Ø)·É¶</p><p></p><p>Aside from the occasional mischief caused by some local minor demons, the Lishui Empire no longer faced the kind of demonic calamity brought by the Black Tongue Demon.</p><p></p><p>As a result, the King of Lishui, along with his officials, bid farewell to Lu Changsheng and led the commoners outside of Moyu Town to resettle back in their original town.</p><p></p><p>After all, with the demonic threat gone, it was no longer suitable to keep residing outside of Moyu Town, as everything from clothing, food, housing, and transportation would be inconvenient.</p><p></p><p>Elder Guchelin and Second Elder also came with Tongxin and Lin Dong to bid farewell to Lu Changsheng.</p><p></p><p>Elder Guchelin speculated that the Demon Realm might not be at rest, but would attack again at some point, though no one could determine the exact timing - it could be in a few days, or even a few years...</p><p></p><p>A few years may seem like a long time in the mortal world, but for the cultivation world and the demon-spirit realms, it is not that long.</p><p></p><p>Therefore, under these circumstances, Elder Guchelin decided to take Lin Dong back to the Qiyun Sect first to hold the grand ceremony for accepting disciples.</p><p></p><p>The Third Year.</p><p></p><p>The immortal who appeared on the night the Black Tongue Demon attacked had already become hazy in the memories of the commoners.</p><p></p><p>They knew that immortals existed in the world, but after that night, they never saw him again.</p><p></p><p>As time passed, the Lishui Empire enjoyed great peace, with the commoners living and working happily, planting in spring and harvesting in autumn.</p><p></p><p>Gradually, they let down their guard against the seemingly vanished demons and spirits.</p><p></p><p>They were immersed in their blissful lives.</p><p></p><p>Elder Guchelin would often bring Tongxin and Lin Dong to visit Lu Changsheng, and they would bring fine wines as gifts.</p><p></p><p>Afterwards, they would frequently praise how exceptionally talented Lin Dong was, and how his character was beloved by all the elders in the sect, with the sect master himself having to restrain himself from forcibly taking Lin Dong as his disciple.</p><p></p><p>Whenever this happened, Lin Dong would scratch his head, feeling embarrassed, while glancing at Lu Changsheng out of the corner of his eye, hoping to receive his teacher's praise.</p><p></p><p>As they spent more time together, Guchelin and the others came to understand Lu Changsheng's personality better. Although they still held him in deep reverence, they had become much more relaxed, no longer as stiff as before.</p><p></p><p>Guchelin and Tongxin also started addressing him as "teacher" like Lin Dong, without the previous formality.</p><p></p><p>Time continued to pass...</p><p></p><p>The Fifth Winter.</p><p></p><p>Due to the cold weather, there were fewer people on the streets of Moyu Town, as most were huddled at home warming themselves by the fire.</p><p></p><p>A young man in a blue robe with a gourd at his waist appeared, his expression calm with a slight smile on his lips.</p><p></p><p>"Ah, Teacher, it's been a while since I've seen you out on the streets."</p><p></p><p>"Teacher, how do you maintain your skin so well? When I first met you, you looked the same, and even now you still look the same - I'm so envious!"</p><p></p><p>"Hmph, what do you know? People's constitutions are different, and moreover, as a great scholar like you, with the vast knowledge nourishing your body, it's only natural that you age slower, isn't it?"</p><p></p><p>The passersby on the street all greeted Lu Changsheng with a smile and politeness.</p><p></p><p>Lu Changsheng was not arrogant, nodding in acknowledgment to each of them, his slight smile warming the frigid winter day like the gentle sun.</p><p></p><p>Over these five years, Lu Changsheng had frequently appeared on the streets of Moyu Town, and his unique scholarly demeanor had long since endeared him to the hearts of the people.</p><p></p><p>Everyone was quite familiar with him now, knowing his name was Lu Changsheng, but they didn't know where he lived...</p><p></p><p>It was as if he appeared and disappeared in a mysterious way.</p><p></p><p>Suddenly, Lu Changsheng paused in his steps, quietly gazing at a young girl in front of him. She had two baskets in front of her, filled with a variety of colorful fruits.</p><p></p><p>At this moment, the girl seemed to feel the cold, and cupped her hands to blow on them, her gaze then landing on the young man in blue, and she froze.</p><p></p><p>Here is the full English translation of the Chinese excerpt:</p><p></p><p>The memories in her mind gushed out like a spring. Over the past five years, she had come to this Moyu Town countless times, but she had never seen this young man in green clothes before. Today, she saw him again.</p><p></p><p>"Brother, brother..."</p><p></p><p>Lu Changsheng came in front of her, squatted down and examined the basket of jujubes, asking, "Little miss, how much are these fruits?"</p><p></p><p>The girl was stunned. Five years ago, this brother had come to buy red fruits, and he had asked the same question.</p><p></p><p>It's just that after five years, whether it was his appearance or his clothes, it seemed that nothing had changed...</p><p></p><p>"Brother, how many do you want?" the girl asked softly.</p><p></p><p>Lu Changsheng looked up and smiled lightly, "If they're delicious, I don't mind taking them all. Can I try one first to see how it tastes?"</p><p></p><p>The girl: "Of course you can."</p><p></p><p>Lu Changsheng nodded slightly, reached into the basket, and took out a jujube.</p><p></p><p>Under the girl's expectant gaze, he tossed it into his mouth.</p><p></p><p>Lu Changsheng chewed a few times and smiled, "Do you know what flavor this jujube is?"</p><p></p><p>"Huh?" The girl was stunned.</p><p></p><p>Of course it was sweet, and crisp and sweet.</p><p></p><p>Five years ago, he had also asked a similarly strange question...</p><p></p><p>Lu Changsheng didn't say anything, patted his hands, stood up and said, "I'll take them all, how much is it?"</p><p></p><p>The girl hurriedly said, "Brother, these two baskets of jujubes are fifteen copper coins."</p><p></p><p>Lu Changsheng nodded, rummaged in his pocket, and handed her a handful of copper coins. Then he was about to pick up the two baskets and leave.</p><p></p><p>"Brother, wait!"</p><p></p><p>At this time, Xiao Tong hurriedly called out to Lu Changsheng.</p><p></p><p>"Hmm?" Lu Changsheng turned his head to look at her.</p><p></p><p>The girl stared blankly at those eyes, then quickly averted her gaze, a flush rising on her face, and said in a low voice, "Brother, you gave too much, you gave five more copper coins."</p><p></p><p>Lu Changsheng smiled unconcernedly, "The extra five can be counted as the cost of the basket and the carrying pole."</p><p></p><p>"No, no, no..." The girl waved her hands frantically, came to Lu Changsheng's side, and put ten copper coins back into the basket.</p><p></p><p>Lu Changsheng's eyes flashed, then he heard the girl say with a smile,</p><p></p><p>"Brother, I know you've forgotten, but Xiao Tong clearly remembers that five years ago, when you bought two baskets of red fruits from me, you also gave five more copper coins. This time, Xiao Tong is returning them to you, after five years... I'm sorry."</p><p></p><p>"Grandma said that two baskets and a carrying pole are not worth five copper coins at all, and she said we are poor, but we must have a conscience."</p><p></p><p>Looking at the smiling girl, Lu Changsheng nodded slightly.</p><p></p><p>He took out a silver coin from his pocket and handed it to the dazed Xiao Tong, smiling, "Who says it's not worth it? And I think it's worth more now."</p><p></p><p>Xiao Tong lowered her head and stared stupidly at the silver coin in her palm, her hand trembling uncontrollably!</p><p></p><p>A silver coin... </p><p></p><p>One silver coin was worth a thousand copper coins!</p><p></p><p>"Brother, I..." </p><p></p><p>Xiao Tong suddenly looked up, but Lu Changsheng's figure had already disappeared.</p><p></p><p>After a moment, Xiao Tong tightly gripped the silver coin and deeply bowed in the direction Lu Changsheng had disappeared.</p><p></p><p>As she straightened up, she seemed to have thought of something, her expression becoming excited, and she vigorously clenched her fist!</p><p></p><p>Then she ran towards a certain place.</p><p></p><p>"Grandma's walking stick seems to be quite old... Oh yes, and the clothes too..."</p>

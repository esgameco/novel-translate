        <h1>Chapter 245</h1>
        <div class="content">
            <p>Here is the full English translation of the Chinese excerpt:</p><p></p><p>The Divine Celestial Realm, an unnamed domain. ‚òÆ‚ôï‚ùª‚ùæùìàùì±‡∏¢–ñ.Ôº£ÔΩèùêåüíò‡∂è</p><p></p><p>"Damn it, we had just barely recovered, but that bastard Ye Wutian suddenly went berserk again and started relentlessly pursuing us!" </p><p></p><p>Shi Wushi rubbed his bald head and muttered while gazing at the distant mountains and wilderness.</p><p></p><p>It had been a while, and Shi Wushi's figure had grown plump again.</p><p></p><p>By his side, Chu Lingxuan, Feng Jiu, and Gu Yinyang were also sighing and frowning dejectedly.</p><p></p><p>Although they had mentally prepared themselves when entering the Ancestral Celestial Realm, Ye Wutian was just too ruthless!</p><p></p><p>It could be said that from the moment they entered the Ancestral Celestial Realm and parted ways with the Immortal Emperor of Longevity, they had been trapped in an endless cycle of pursuit and escape.</p><p></p><p>They had been living a life of constant upheaval and fugitivity.</p><p></p><p>Fortunately, the old turtle with deep sentiments had remained in the Ancestral Celestial Realm, or else they would have already died a few times over.</p><p></p><p>"If it really can't be helped, let's go find Snow Tower and ask for help again," Feng Jiu said with a frown.</p><p></p><p>Chu Lingxuan twitched his mouth, helplessly saying, "Snow Tower has already asked his ancestors to help us twice. Even though he's still willing to help us, his ancestors are not too happy about it..."</p><p></p><p>"Yes, you have to understand that the opponent is the Immortal King Pavilion of Ye Wutian. Snow Tower has already done his utmost to help us twice, we can't keep burdening him."</p><p></p><p>Gu Yinyang shook his head and sighed.</p><p></p><p>Gu Yinyang's condition now looked much better, no longer the moribund state he was in when they first entered the Ancestral Celestial Realm.</p><p></p><p>Shi Wushi rolled his eyes and said, "Lately, Ye Wutian has been acting like a madman. Continuing to flee like this is not a solution, we'll eventually be caught by him. Why don't we just go all-in and head to the Divine Emperor's Palace?"</p><p></p><p>Upon hearing this, Chu Lingxuan and Feng Jiu's eyes showed some interest.</p><p></p><p>But Gu Yinyang glanced at Shi Wushi and sneered, "You make it sound so easy. After all these years of wandering, we've only just barely reached the outskirts of the Divine Celestial Realm. The Divine Emperor's Palace is in the Crimson Celestial Realm, separated by the Primordial Celestial Realm. And those teleportation formations are all guarded by people Ye Wutian has connections with."</p><p></p><p>"Tell me, how can we get to the Divine Emperor's Palace? The dangers along the way aside, how much time do you think it would take?"</p><p></p><p>Shi Wushi became annoyed and retorted, "Hey, I was just suggesting it. Why are you being so sarcastic, Gu Yinyang?"</p><p></p><p>"Tch." Gu Yinyang disdainfully glanced at him and said, "Let's wait for the old turtle to come back and see what he thinks. You can't make the decision on your own."</p><p></p><p>Seeing Gu Yinyang's attitude, Shi Wushi got angry and rolled up his sleeves, loudly shouting, "Gu Yinyang, I've been disliking you for a long time. Let's have a one-on-one fight!"</p><p></p><p>"A one-on-one fight? Bring it on, who's afraid of whom?" Gu Yinyang naturally didn't back down, glaring and snorting.</p><p></p><p>"Ah, you two, can you stop arguing? Arguing and bickering every day, it's so annoying!" </p><p></p><p>The usually gentle Feng Jiu finally couldn't hold back, rubbing her temples in fatigue and sternly scolding them with a sharp gaze, "Even if you want to fight, can't you at least consider the timing and location? We're being hunted right now, you two big brothers!"</p><p></p><p>Shi Wushi and Gu Yinyang were startled, and they smiled awkwardly at her, not daring to speak.</p><p></p><p>This was the first time they had seen Feng Jiu get angry.</p><p></p><p>Seeing this, Chu Lingxuan's delicate face showed a wistful expression as he shook his head, stood up, clasped his hands behind his back, and looked up at the sky, sighing, "I miss the Immortal Emperor of Longevity a bit."</p><p></p><p>The other three: "......"</p><p></p><p>They really wanted to retort, "Lingxuan, when have you not missed the Immortal Emperor of Longevity?"</p><p></p><p>"Ahem." Shi Wushi said, "Who doesn't? But it's useless. Who knows where the old man is now, happily wandering about? He's definitely not in the Ancestral Celestial Realm."</p><p></p><p>"Far away water cannot extinguish the nearby fire."</p><p></p><p>Here is the full English translation of the Chinese excerpt:</p><p></p><p>"Furthermore, the Immortal Emperor has helped us a lot. Even if the Immortal Emperor were here, we can't keep bothering him. This time, we have to make our own efforts to break through the predicament," he said.</p><p></p><p>Hearing this, Gu Yinyang chuckled mockingly and gave him a thumbs up. "You are remarkable, you are lofty. Tell me, how do you plan to break through?"</p><p></p><p>Shi Wushi's expression suddenly darkened. </p><p></p><p>This guy is being sarcastic with him again!! </p><p></p><p>This is something he can tolerate, but not something he can endure!</p><p></p><p>Just as he was about to roll up his sleeves and get into a big argument with Gu Yinyang,</p><p></p><p>A hunched old man suddenly appeared in front of the four of them.</p><p></p><p>The four were delighted,</p><p></p><p>Shi Wushi immediately calmed down, walked up to the old man, and affectionately said, </p><p></p><p>"Old Turtle, you're finally back. Without you, the four of us wouldn't know how to survive. By the way, why did it take you so long to investigate the situation?"</p><p></p><p>The Old Turtle instinctively pulled his collar tighter and chuckled, "Ah, Grandpa Turtle is back now. The main reason is that the situation has become quite dire, so it took me some time."</p><p></p><p>Quite dire!</p><p></p><p>The hearts of Chu LingtiƒÅn's four people trembled, and their expressions immediately turned solemn. Could it be that...</p><p></p><p>At this moment, the sharp-eyed Gu Yinyang suddenly noticed the few red marks on the Old Turtle's neck...</p><p></p><p>He was moved, and coughed dryly, saying mysteriously, "Old Turtle, what happened to your neck? Were you injured during your previous trip?"</p><p></p><p>Huh?</p><p></p><p>Immediately, the gazes of the other three turned to look, and sure enough, they saw the red marks on the Old Turtle's neck.</p><p></p><p>They were stunned, and Phoenix Nine quickly spat out angrily, </p><p></p><p>They understood, it turned out that the Old Turtle had actually gone to have a good time!</p><p></p><p>They were not children, how could they not understand that these red marks were obviously left by a young lady's kisses?</p><p></p><p>Well, this lecherous Old Turtle... Even when being pursued, he couldn't forget this, truly a model for them.</p><p></p><p>But of course, they wouldn't say anything, and they wouldn't even mind it in their hearts, after all, the Old Turtle could have stayed out of it, but he chose to stand with them, without him, they would have died long ago.</p><p></p><p>The Old Turtle was startled, not expecting to be discovered. It seems the collar was not high enough. He then rubbed his hands and laughed dryly, "Hehe, just a little leisure time."</p><p></p><p>But his expression soon became solemn as he said, "However, the situation has indeed become dire. We must leave the Heavenly Saint Continent immediately. That bastard Ye Wutian has come for real this time. Not only has he mobilized the entire Godking Palace, but he has even coordinated with other Godking Palaces to surround us!"</p><p></p><p>"They used some unknown means to discover our whereabouts, and are now chasing after us in this direction."</p><p></p><p>What?</p><p></p><p>Chu LingtiƒÅn's four people were shocked!</p><p></p><p>"Old Turtle, what are we going to do?" Shi Wushi asked anxiously.</p><p></p><p>Slap!</p><p></p><p>The Old Turtle suddenly slapped the back of his fat head and said impatiently, "Idiot, of course we run! What else can we do!"</p><p></p><p>He was still angry in his heart. He was having a good time at that brothel, but after sensing the danger, he was forced to cut it short, which really pissed him off.</p><p></p><p>He swore that if he had the chance, he would definitely grind Ye Wutian into powder, the scoundrel!</p><p></p><p>"I naturally know to run, the problem is where to run to..." Shi Wushi said helplessly while covering his head.</p><p></p><p>Gu Yinyang inwardly rejoiced at the sight, but he didn't have the mood to show a smile in this situation.</p><p></p><p>Chu LingtiƒÅn and Phoenix Nine also looked at the Old Turtle anxiously, as he was their mainstay when facing the mighty Godking Palace.</p><p></p><p>The Old Turtle sighed deeply, gazing into the distance, and sighed heavily,</p><p></p><p>"We will flee the Heavenly Saint Continent, cross the Primordial, and go to the Crimson Empyrean Continent to find the Divine Emperor's Palace!"</p><p></p><p>"Although the journey is long and the time cost will be quite high, this is the only option we have left now."</p><p></p><p>"With the master not here... It is truly a difficult path ahead."</p>

        <h1>Chapter 334</h1>
        <div class="content">
            <p>Here is the full English translation of the Chinese excerpt:</p><p></p><p>Today, outside the Xiaoyao Sect, a group of uninvited guests arrived - an old man and two middle-aged men accompanied by a group of young men and women dressed in uniform attire.</p><p></p><p>The two mountain guard disciples immediately narrowed their eyes and raised their hands, shouting, "Halt, you are not welcome here. This is the Xiaoyao Sect!"</p><p></p><p>"Hmph," the leading old man sneered. "I am the Grand Elder of the Crimson Yang Palace. Have your sect master come out to receive us."</p><p></p><p>The two middle-aged men and the disciples behind him also looked gloomy as they gazed at the two mountain guard disciples.</p><p></p><p>In their Crimson Yang Palace domain, how dare they establish a sect without even informing them? This is sheer arrogance!</p><p></p><p>The two mountain guard disciples furrowed their brows. See the sect master? Is this something these people can just demand to see? </p><p></p><p>And what is this Crimson Yang Palace? It sounds like a powerful sect, but the Xiaoyao Sect has just been established, so neither the elders nor the disciples have had time to provoke other sects, right?</p><p></p><p>"Fellow disciple, these people are very strong, more than we two can handle. You stay here and watch them, I'll go report this to the senior."</p><p></p><p>After informing his companion, one of the mountain guard disciples turned and headed towards the mountain gate.</p><p></p><p>"Please wait a moment, my senior has gone to report this," the remaining mountain guard disciple said, cupping his hands.</p><p></p><p>His task now was to appease these people first, and he also needed to be polite, as he was the only one here, lest he inadvertently invite disaster upon himself.</p><p></p><p>"Very well, we shall wait," the old man said indifferently.</p><p></p><p>Hearing this, the group behind him were slightly taken aback, and one of the middle-aged men frowned and said, "Grand Elder, why don't we just..."</p><p></p><p>The old man raised his hand to interrupt him. "It won't take too long."</p><p></p><p>When dealing with a sect whose depth they were still uncertain of, it was better to be courteous first before resorting to force.</p><p></p><p>Seeing this, the others understood the Grand Elder's thoughts and could only wait in silence, though their expressions grew increasingly grim.</p><p></p><p>Shortly after, the mountain guard disciple returned and bowed slightly. "Please follow me, our elders have summoned you."</p><p></p><p>He then turned and headed back into the Xiaoyao Sect.</p><p></p><p>The group was immediately filled with indignation. What an arrogant bunch! The least they could do was send an elder to welcome them.</p><p></p><p>"Let's go," the old man said, his eyes flashing with a cold light, leading the group into the Xiaoyao Sect.</p><p></p><p>Along the way, they saw many Xiaoyao Sect disciples, which gave them a sense of the sect's overall strength. It was not particularly strong, just about average among the sects in the human domain.</p><p></p><p>It wasn't until they passed by the training field and saw the disciples practicing the Xiaoyao Techniques that their expressions changed.</p><p></p><p>What kind of movement technique was that?</p><p></p><p>The Crimson Yang Palace group's previous disdain was somewhat diminished, for a sect whose disciples could cultivate such profound techniques must have a solid foundation.</p><p></p><p>Soon, the Crimson Yang Palace group followed the mountain guard disciple to the Xiaoyao Sect's reception hall.</p><p></p><p>"You may enter," the mountain guard disciple said, bowing slightly before leaving.</p><p></p><p>The old man's eyes flickered as he led the group into the hall.</p><p></p><p>Seeing the group enter, Su Qianghe and Yin Jiuguai exchanged a glance and then stood up, cupping their hands and smiling.</p><p></p><p>"May I ask what brings you honored guests to our Xiaoyao Sect?"</p><p></p><p>The Crimson Yang Palace group immediately focused their gaze on the two men, scrutinizing them. Aside from the disciples, the old man and the two middle-aged men all had a slightly astonished look in their eyes.</p><p></p><p>These two are the elders of the Xiaoyao Sect?</p><p></p><p>They have barely reached the late Spiritual Origin Realm.</p><p></p><p>Here is the full English translation of the Chinese excerpt:</p><p></p><p>Their cultivation... was a bit low.</p><p></p><p>New 69 Book Bar â†’ 69SHU.COM</p><p></p><p>They couldn't help but recall the movement techniques they had seen on the martial field, feeling a bit contradictory.</p><p></p><p>How could a sect with such weak strength possess such movement techniques?</p><p></p><p>The elder didn't really want to communicate with Su Qiang and Yin Jiucui at the moment, feeling it would be a bit demeaning, so he gestured to a middle-aged man behind him.</p><p></p><p>The middle-aged man understood, stepping forward: "Do you two know why we have come here today?"</p><p></p><p>Su Qiang and Yin Jiucui stiffly lowered their hands, feeling a bit displeased. They had greeted the others politely, but the other party didn't even bother with a greeting.</p><p></p><p>If it weren't for the elder giving them a deep, unfathomable feeling, they would have definitely flown into a rage.</p><p></p><p>They also knew that the Carefree Sect had just arrived at the Divine-Demon Battlefield, their foundation was shallow, and their sect's power was a bit lacking, so they naturally had to be cautious and low-key.</p><p></p><p>So Yin Jiucui frowned and said, "You all can just say it directly, we really don't know why you have come to our Carefree Sect."</p><p></p><p>They had just arrived, and hadn't dealt with any forces yet.</p><p></p><p>The middle-aged man sneered and said, "Do you two know that this is the territory of my Crimson Yang Palace?"</p><p></p><p>Su Qiang and Yin Jiucui were stunned for a moment, immediately understanding the other party's meaning.</p><p></p><p>This...</p><p></p><p>They didn't know either, it was the sect master who had placed the Carefree Sect in this location.</p><p></p><p>In that case, it was indeed the fault of their Carefree Sect, after all, they had come to the other party's territory without even greeting them.</p><p></p><p>Su Qiang coughed dryly and cupped his hands, saying, "Esteemed ones, since it is as you say, it is indeed the fault of our Carefree Sect. In that case, how about this, our Carefree Sect is willing to provide compensation within our abilities?"</p><p></p><p>Huh?</p><p></p><p>Seeing the other party be so accommodating, the Crimson Yang Palace members were slightly taken aback, but it was also within their expectations.</p><p></p><p>After all, they were the mighty Crimson Yang Palace.</p><p></p><p>The middle-aged man looked at the elder, apparently asking for the elder's opinion.</p><p></p><p>The elder narrowed his eyes and smiled, "Compensation is fine, we just passed by the martial field and saw your sect's disciples' movement techniques were not bad. As long as your sect provides us with that scroll of movement techniques for the Crimson Yang Palace to appreciate, this matter will be considered settled, and in the future your Carefree Sect can reside in the territory of the Crimson Yang Palace."</p><p></p><p>The Crimson Yang Palace members smiled knowingly. If it was said that this Carefree Sect could provide some decent compensation, they wouldn't believe it. In this way, that movement technique was the most suitable.</p><p></p><p>Su Qiang and Yin Jiucui's faces had already changed. Of course, they knew what the so-called "movement technique" was referring to - it was the core cultivation method of their Carefree Sect, bestowed by the sect master!</p><p></p><p>These people really had big ambitions!</p><p></p><p>Su Qiang's face became indifferent as he said in a deep voice, "Esteemed ones, please consider the matter of compensation carefully, we are all of the human race, don't make it difficult for my Carefree Sect."</p><p></p><p>Yin Jiucui's gaze also became slightly fierce, wanting the Carefree Sect's Carefree Techniques bestowed by the sect master, these people were really asking for the moon.</p><p></p><p>They were willing to compensate, thinking their attitude was good enough.</p><p></p><p>"Difficult? Then don't do it at all."</p><p></p><p>From behind the Crimson Yang Palace's Grand Elder, the illusory image of the Three Wheel Divine Treasure suddenly appeared, and then he abruptly reached out to grab Su Qiang!</p><p></p><p>Now that he had grasped the depth and shallowness of the Carefree Sect, he naturally wouldn't be polite anymore!</p><p></p><p>Su Qiang's gaze changed, not expecting the other party to actually attack directly!!</p><p></p><p>He tried to take a step and activate the Carefree Techniques to evade, but the gap in cultivation was simply too great!</p><p></p><p>The next moment, Su Qiang found himself in the elder's hand, his throat tightly grasped!</p><p></p><p>Seeing this, Yin Jiucui's heart raced as he hastily transmitted a message: "Grand Elder, Second Elder, Fifth Elder, there is a powerful enemy causing trouble!"</p>

        <h1>Chapter 50</h1>
        <div class="content">
            <p>Here is the full English translation of the Chinese excerpt:</p><p></p><p>"Hehe. ‚ôö‚ôû‚ùª‚ûà≈üƒßùïåÔº∏.ùî†·ªñÔΩçüêªüíù"</p><p></p><p>Chu Qingcang did not explain, and in a flash, he appeared at the Golden Monkey's temple, punching fiercely!</p><p></p><p>This momentum was not that of a demonic creature, but rather that of a cultivator!</p><p></p><p>The Golden Monkey Demon King was naturally not a pushover either, his physique was larger, but his movements were not slow.</p><p></p><p>He slightly tilted his head and barely dodged, but his heart had just felt a chill.</p><p></p><p>This Chu Qingcang was really going all out.</p><p></p><p>"Abyss Demon King, Qingcang Demon King!"</p><p></p><p>At this time, the other three great Demon Kings appeared here, looking grim at the scene.</p><p></p><p>Li Tengse abruptly distanced himself from Zhao Shenyuan, warily scanning the three great Demon Kings, and then looked at Zhao Shenyuan and coldly laughed, </p><p></p><p>"Hehe, Zhao Shenyuan, you shouldn't be shameless enough to bully the weak, right?"</p><p></p><p>Zhao Shenyuan's face turned grim, expressionless, </p><p></p><p>"All you Demon Kings come at me together! Today, I will cut off your snake tail! Daring to run amok in our Demon Realm, you must pay a price!"</p><p></p><p>The three great Demon Kings nodded, not the least bit surprised.</p><p></p><p>In their hearts, they all thought, "Not bad, this is very much like Zhao Shenyuan."</p><p></p><p>"You!" </p><p></p><p>Li Tengse's face changed, disbelievingly saying: "Despicable and shameless, aren't you afraid that the other Demons in your Demon Realm will laugh at this behavior? Don't you feel ashamed?"</p><p></p><p>"Haha haha, stop talking nonsense, the victor is the king, the loser is the bandit!"</p><p></p><p>Zhao Shenyuan laughed heartily, in his eyes, this way of bullying the weak is no less enjoyable than a one-on-one fight.</p><p></p><p>Li Tengse looked at the four Demon Kings in front of him, his face turning green.</p><p></p><p>At the same time, his heart started to tremble slightly.</p><p></p><p>Today, it seems he will be in a sorry state.</p><p></p><p>...........</p><p></p><p>Spirit Dust Realm.</p><p></p><p>In the Eastern Domain, the news of the Qingyun Sect's plot to invade the Demon and Demonic Realms and seize the Immortal Tomb had finally spread.</p><p></p><p>As for the Southern, Western, and Northern Domains, due to the distance and unfamiliarity, it will take some time.</p><p></p><p>Once the news was spread, naturally, very few sects believed it, and even fewer took any action. However, there were some exceptions.</p><p></p><p>Eastern Domain, Flying Star Valley's Main Hall.</p><p></p><p>"Regarding the news spread by the Qingyun Sect in the Eastern part, what are the opinions of the Elders?" </p><p></p><p>Valley Master Yuan Hua stood with his hands behind his back, asking indifferently.</p><p></p><p>"Valley Master, before discussing the truth or falsehood of this matter, we only want to ask, what use is there for the Demon and Demonic Realms to plot the Immortal Tomb? Everyone knows the Immortal Tomb, after countless years, the so-called secrets of longevity have not been fathomed by anyone."</p><p></p><p>An Elder stepped forward and bowed, saying.</p><p></p><p>"Correct." The other Elders all nodded.</p><p></p><p>Regarding this point alone, they did not believe the Demon and Demonic Realms would plot the Immortal Tomb.</p><p></p><p>What is there to plot? If the Demon Sovereigns and Demonic Sovereigns want to fathom it, they can just go to the Immortal Tomb directly, why bother with this big show?</p><p></p><p>After all, the Immortal Tomb belongs to no one, anyone can go and contemplate it.</p><p></p><p>Yuan Hua pursed his lips and said, "But what if the news spread by the Qingyun Sect is true?"</p><p></p><p>The Elders were slightly taken aback, and the same Elder smiled and said, "Valley Master, according to our previous view, the possibility of this being true is extremely small... However, it is true that the Qingyun Sect is not a small sect in the Eastern Domain, and they even have the Alchemist Master Gu Helin, so we also find it difficult to understand why they would... Sigh."</p><p></p><p>Yuan Hua indifferently said again, "No need for more words, if the question I just asked is true, what then?"</p><p></p><p>The hall fell silent for a moment, and many Elders' eyes flickered.</p><p></p><p>An Elder stood up, bowed, and said in a solemn voice,</p><p></p><p>"Valley Master, even if it's true, we don't know the time of the Demon and Demonic Realms' attack, do we have to keep sending people there to wait? Even if it's ten years, or even a hundred years, do we have to keep waiting?"</p><p></p><p>The other Elders nodded, this was exactly what they were thinking.</p><p></p><p>Moreover, even if the Demon and Demonic Realms attacked, they were still quite far from the direction of the Immortal Tomb, and it wouldn't affect them for the time being.</p><p></p><p>When the time comes, the cultivation sects of the four domains can join forces, the Demon and Demonic Realms will not be a threat.</p><p></p><p>It's better to take care of their own affairs first.</p><p></p><p>Yuan Hua's eyes flickered.</p><p></p><p>Here is the full English translation of the Chinese excerpt:</p><p></p><p>"Look at the Elder," he said to a senior disciple, "Fifth Elder, select some elite disciples and lead them to the Qingyun Sect. In three years, if you don't discover any strange activities between the demonic and immortal realms, then come back."</p><p></p><p>The elders were taken aback and wanted to say something.</p><p></p><p>Yuan Hua's gaze turned cold. "Shut up."</p><p></p><p>The elders immediately fell silent.</p><p></p><p>The Fifth Elder stepped forward, bowing respectfully. "I will obey the orders of the Sect Master."</p><p></p><p>Yuan Hua nodded, his gaze seeming to traverse the mountains and rivers as he looked towards the direction of the Qingyun Sect, murmuring to himself, "Sect Master Miaojun, the Sect Master knows your character, so this time I will go against the majority's opinion and trust you."</p><p></p><p>At the same time, in the Eastern Domain, at the Purple Extreme Thunder Peak.</p><p></p><p>If one were to say that sects like the Qingyun Sect and the Flying Star Valley were considered relatively large sects in the immortal cultivation world of the Eastern Domain, then the Purple Extreme Thunder Peak would be the undisputed leader!</p><p></p><p>The Purple Extreme Thunder Peak rose up, piercing through the clouds and standing between heaven and earth. Lightning flashed and thunder roared at the peak year-round, unceasing.</p><p></p><p>Compared to the mountain peak where the Qingyun Sect was located, it was like a young man - tranquil and serene, while the Purple Extreme Thunder Peak was more like a robust and domineering man.</p><p></p><p>"Rumble‚Äî"</p><p></p><p>At this moment, near the peak of the Purple Extreme Thunder Peak, the thunderous roar echoed above, and below were two figures.</p><p></p><p>One was seated in meditation with eyes closed, the other was bowing.</p><p></p><p>"Recently, have there been any news of Fellow Daoist Zhang's ascension?" the middle-aged man in the plain robe asked indifferently.</p><p></p><p>"Venerable Ancestor, there has been no news yet of the Patriarch of the Carefree Abode's ascension, but I've heard it's about to happen..." the bowing middle-aged man hurriedly replied.</p><p></p><p>"Mm, the Carefree Abode is in the Western Domain, quite a distance from my Purple Extreme Thunder Peak. Remember, the moment you hear any news, come report to me immediately. I won't be in seclusion during this time." The middle-aged man in the plain robe spoke calmly.</p><p></p><p>Crossing the tribulation to achieve immortal ascension was a rare occurrence once in a thousand years. For cultivators at the Nascent Soul stage and above, it was an incredibly precious opportunity.</p><p></p><p>"Yes, Venerable Ancestor, rest assured." The middle-aged man did not immediately leave, but hesitated.</p><p></p><p>"Hmm? Is there something else?" At this, the middle-aged man in the plain robe opened his eyes, and a flash of lightning seemed to pass through his pupils, striking one's soul with fear.</p><p></p><p>Judging from his brows and eyes, he was one of the Tribulation Crossing cultivators who had appeared after L√º Changsheng and the old turtle had left the ascension passage that day - Jiang Yuan!</p><p></p><p>He was originally the Venerable Ancestor of the Purple Extreme Thunder Peak.</p><p></p><p>The middle-aged man trembled slightly, hesitating for a moment before speaking, "Venerable Ancestor, a rumor has been widely circulating in the immortal cultivation world of the Eastern Domain recently, about the Qingyun Sect..."</p><p></p><p>After a moment, the middle-aged man finished speaking and bowed his head tremblingly, deeply regretting his decision.</p><p></p><p>He should not have mentioned such a trivial matter to the Venerable Ancestor at all. There was no need for it.</p><p></p><p>"The demonic and immortal realms plotting to seize the immortal tombs?" Jiang Yuan's eyes showed a hint of confusion.</p><p></p><p>As a Tribulation Crossing cultivator, he did not immediately doubt the authenticity of this news, but instead thought of other possibilities.</p><p></p><p>Over the countless years, had the secrets of the immortal tombs not been thoroughly explored by someone? </p><p></p><p>If the news of the demonic and immortal realms suddenly plotting to seize the immortal tombs was true, did that mean they had found a way to obtain the secrets of longevity hidden within the immortal tombs?</p><p></p><p>But if they had the means, why would they make such a public move? Wouldn't it be better to do it secretly?</p><p></p><p>There were some contradictions...</p><p></p><p>"What is the source of this news?" Jiang Yuan asked the middle-aged man.</p><p></p><p>The middle-aged man was taken aback, and respectfully replied, "Venerable Ancestor, it's from the Qingyun Sect."</p><p></p><p>The next moment, Jiang Yuan slowly rose to his feet in the middle-aged man's disbelieving gaze, his figure fading away...</p><p></p><p>Only his voice remained, saying, "I'll go to the Qingyun Sect. You keep an eye out, and if you hear any news of Fellow Daoist Zhang's immortal ascension, inform me immediately."</p>

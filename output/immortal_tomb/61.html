        <h1>Chapter 61</h1>
        <div class="content">
            <p>Here is the full English translation of the Chinese excerpt:</p><p></p><p>Outside the town of Moyu, the earth shook and the sky rumbled.üêù </p><p></p><p>Successive explosions and endless beast roars pierced the nerves of every person like steel nails.</p><p></p><p>"My Lord, there are so many demonic beasts outside, can the Immortal alone withstand them...what if..." </p><p></p><p>"Yes, what if the Immortal is defeated, then we, we will all die, wuwu."</p><p></p><p>"Ah, we common folk really have a hard life. We haven't even lived in peace for a few years, and now we have demonic troubles again, and each time it's more fierce than the last. This Moyu Town, in my opinion, is an inauspicious place. If we survive this time, we should migrate to another town."</p><p></p><p>"......"</p><p></p><p>The townspeople's faces were tense as they discussed among themselves.</p><p></p><p>Hearing this, Tong Xin and Lin Dong's expressions changed slightly, but they didn't say anything. Their hearts were with the ancient crane Lin, who was battling outside.</p><p></p><p>But Chen Datao's face showed disbelief. He stepped forward and shouted sternly, "Some of you are only concerned about your own lives and deaths. Do you not know that the ancient Immortal outside is fighting the demonic beasts for your sake alone?"</p><p></p><p>The chattering townspeople fell silent. Chen Datao had been the lord of Moyu Town for thirteen years and still commanded great authority.</p><p></p><p>Chen Datao swept his gaze over them, his eyes like blades.</p><p></p><p>People are inherently selfish, caring only for themselves, but there's a big difference between keeping certain thoughts to oneself and voicing them out loud! It was truly heartbreaking.</p><p></p><p>"Ever since the Immortal stepped in to resolve the demonic calamity eight years ago when you were in despair, have you begun to think that the Immortal's protection of you is a given?" Chen Datao said coldly.</p><p></p><p>The din outside continued, while inside the town, it was eerily quiet.</p><p></p><p>"My Lord, isn't it said that the greater one's abilities, the greater one's responsibilities? That's only reasonable, isn't it, everyone?" a woman mustered the courage to say tremblingly.</p><p></p><p>Many people nodded in agreement at her words.</p><p></p><p>Chen Datao's eyes turned icy, about to speak, when Tong Xin finally couldn't hold back and suddenly darted in front of him, snarling, "Insolence!"</p><p></p><p>The woman paled and stumbled back.</p><p></p><p>The townspeople, seeing Tong Xin's sudden movement, were also gripped by fear.</p><p></p><p>"TheÁ¶ªÊ∞¥ Empire is under the jurisdiction of my Qingyun Sect. When demonic troubles arise, we will do our utmost to intervene! Have we ever abandoned you?" Tong Xin's usually cheerful face was now gloomy as he spoke harshly.</p><p></p><p>"My master is still out there struggling against the demonic beasts. Some of you had better watch your words, lest you make someone's heart grow cold...otherwise, you won't even need the demonic beasts to devour you, for I will personally slaughter you insignificant insects before that!"</p><p></p><p>The townspeople dared not speak anymore, cowering with their heads down in fright.</p><p></p><p>"Brother, let it go," Lin Dong came up to Tong Xin, tugging his sleeve softly.</p><p></p><p>Tong Xin pursed his lips and turned away without another word.</p><p></p><p>Boom!</p><p></p><p>At that moment, the town wall suddenly collapsed, and the intense scene unfolded before everyone's eyes.</p><p></p><p>Waves of demonic beasts charged towards the ancient crane Lin, and many demonic beasts also hovered in the air, unleashing a dazzling array of demonic arts.</p><p></p><p>The ancient crane Lin could only barely hold them off. </p><p></p><p>Although he was at the Yuanying stage now, he couldn't withstand the sheer number of demonic beasts.</p><p></p><p>Moreover, he also had to divide his attention to the giant earth bear beside him.</p><p></p><p>When his spiritual energy was exhausted, it would be the end.</p><p></p><p>The giant earth bear's brow furrowed slightly. This ancient crane Lin still showed no sign of compromise.</p><p></p><p>He actually wanted the ancient crane Lin to join their demonic realm. It would be a waste for him to die like this.</p><p></p><p>The giant earth bear suddenly looked towards the town, baring his teeth in a chilling smile.</p><p></p><p>Here is the full English translation of the Chinese excerpt:</p><p></p><p>"You little ants, don't be in a hurry. Watch carefully as the performance of your Ancient Immortal Master unfolds, it will be your turn soon enough... hehe."</p><p></p><p>These words caused great panic among the villagers, with many of them becoming so frightened that their legs turned weak and they collapsed to the ground.</p><p></p><p>They could clearly see that the Ancient Crane Forest side had not gained any advantage either, and moreover, the opponent still had their most formidable fighter yet to make a move, as if they were toying with the villagers.</p><p></p><p>Although Chen Dadao and the others were also very afraid, they were more concerned about the predicament of the Ancient Crane Forest at the moment.</p><p></p><p>"The Lord... where is the Master?" </p><p></p><p>The steward couldn't help but ask in a hoarse voice, his mind filled with the image of the man in blue.</p><p></p><p>Chen Dadao paused for a moment, then sighed, "It's been eight years, you... whenever something happens, you always call him 'Master, Master'. The Master is not our guardian, he can't always be here to protect us."</p><p></p><p>"This servant has spoken out of turn." The steward apologized, then lifted his head to look outside the town.</p><p></p><p>His face only showed worry, without much fear.</p><p></p><p>Because he was old, and knew he didn't have many years left to live...</p><p></p><p>At the same time, </p><p></p><p>less than ten zhang (about 33 meters) behind the Great Earth Bear Dragon, </p><p></p><p>there were two figures standing, yet they were strangely unnoticed by anyone, including the Great Earth Bear Dragon.</p><p></p><p>"Master, that Crane Forest fellow's spiritual energy is about to be exhausted," the old turtle said, stroking his beard and chuckling.</p><p></p><p>Lu Changsheng's pupils flashed with a trace of blue light as he glanced at the back of the Great Earth Bear Dragon and murmured, "The main performance is about to begin."</p><p></p><p>The old turtle was puzzled. "Master, what do you mean by the 'main performance'?"</p><p></p><p>Lu Changsheng picked up the gourd at his waist and took a sip, not bothering to answer him.</p><p></p><p>...</p><p></p><p>"Senior brother, besides sending a message to the Sect Master, have you communicated with anyone else in the sect?" Lin Dong asked anxiously.</p><p></p><p>Tong Xin kept his eyes fixed on Ancient Crane Forest's figure and nodded. "I've sent messages to the elders in the sect as well as other places in the Lishui Empire."</p><p></p><p>"Then..." Lin Dong wanted to ask more but hesitated.</p><p></p><p>"Junior brother, not only is Moyu Town in chaos, other places in the Lishui Empire are also facing demonic disturbances. The elders can't leave their posts, and as for the sect... let's not even mention that, since there's no teleportation array here, they'll be too late by the time someone arrives."</p><p></p><p>Tong Xin said helplessly.</p><p></p><p>Lin Dong was disappointed, but then hopeful again. "What about the Master? Didn't he go to help the Sect Master through his tribulation? Why hasn't he come back?"</p><p></p><p>Hearing this, Tong Xin glanced at the villagers behind them with an indecipherable look in his eyes. "Perhaps the Master has been delayed by some matters."</p><p></p><p>Boom!!</p><p></p><p>At this moment, Ancient Crane Forest staggered back several steps, quickly shoving another batch of medicinal pills into his mouth. Although he had no serious injuries, his complexion was deathly pale, indicating he had consumed a tremendous amount of energy.</p><p></p><p>"Sect Master!" </p><p></p><p>Tong Xin and Lin Dong were about to rush forward, but were stopped by a wave of Ancient Crane Forest's hand.</p><p></p><p>"Hahaha! Ancient Immortal, your spiritual energy is depleted, isn't it? Let me ask you one more time, are you willing to join my Demon Realm? Cultivation is arduous, and reaching the Nascent Soul stage is even more difficult. With your talent, you'll be able to ascend to immortality in the future. Don't let these insignificant ants ruin your immortal path!"</p><p></p><p>The Great Earth Bear Dragon laughed arrogantly, staring at Ancient Crane Forest.</p><p></p><p>Hearing this, the villagers' faces turned even paler, looking at Ancient Crane Forest with hopeful eyes.</p><p></p><p>"Immortal, please don't abandon us..."</p><p></p><p>He was the only one who could fight against the demonic beast, and if he gave up, their fate would be unimaginable.</p><p></p><p>Ancient Crane Forest did not respond to the Great Earth Bear Dragon's words, only focusing on desperately refining the medicinal power within his body.</p><p></p><p>Suddenly, the Great Earth Bear Dragon let out a sinister laugh.</p><p></p><p>"Ancient Immortal, no matter what happens next, please don't be too disheartened..."</p>

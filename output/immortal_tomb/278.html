        <h1>Chapter 278</h1>
        <div class="content">
            <p>Here is the full English translation of the Chinese excerpt:</p><p></p><p>Seeing that Fu Liangcai's face had turned slightly gloomy, Ouyang Nuo's eyebrows furrowed, and he pretended to be sorrowful, saying:</p><p></p><p>"Patriarch Fu, your Fu Clan has suddenly received such tragic news, and as the Patriarch, I deeply feel the sorrow... Ah, in those years, the old ancestor of the Fu Clan was so graceful, but in the end, he could not escape the ravages of time..."</p><p></p><p>Beside them, Xu Chong and Gao Teng's mouths twitched.</p><p></p><p>This Ouyang Nuo, he really kills people and then rubs salt in the wound.</p><p></p><p>He was clearly harboring evil intentions, yet he still put on this yin-yang weird act... Who was laughing so happily just now?</p><p></p><p>Fu Liangcai raised his eyebrows, seeing that Ouyang Nuo actually made a joke about the recently departed old ancestor, and his anger rose from his heart as he shouted:</p><p></p><p>"Ouyang Nuo, don't pretend anymore!"</p><p></p><p>Ouyang Nuo paused, then his expression quickly changed from sorrow to joy, and he smiled brilliantly:</p><p></p><p>"Alright, then I won't pretend anymore, Patriarch Fu. Let's open the window and speak plainly. I'm sure you know why we're here, so what is your Fu Clan's attitude?"</p><p></p><p>The crowd was stunned, knowing that the main event was about to begin!</p><p></p><p>"Attitude?" Fu Liangcai grinned and said, "If you want to attack, then just attack, no need for so much nonsense. My Fu Clan will never surrender, even if we are destroyed, we will make you suffer some losses!"</p><p></p><p>After saying this, he coldly waved his sleeve and disappeared into the Fu Clan's main gate!</p><p></p><p>The crowd was in an uproar.</p><p></p><p>Ouyang Nuo's face suddenly turned gloomy. This Fu Liangcai... really has a good backbone!</p><p></p><p>What he just said, of course, he had no intention of sparing the Fu Clan, </p><p></p><p>he just... wanted to see Fu Liangcai beg for mercy.</p><p></p><p>What a pity.</p><p></p><p>Ouyang Nuo suddenly turned his head and looked at Xu Chong and Gao Teng, "You two, are you willing to follow my Ouyang Clan to attack the Fu Clan?"</p><p></p><p>Xu Chong and Gao Teng hesitated when they heard this.</p><p></p><p>"Heh, you two don't worry, I won't let you work for nothing. After the Fu Clan's resources are divided, each of your clans will get one-tenth!" Ouyang Nuo raised one finger and said lightly.</p><p></p><p>"Okay!!" Xu Chong and Gao Teng no longer hesitated and immediately agreed.</p><p></p><p>Getting one-tenth is also a lot, and for them, it's like finding free money! There's absolutely no risk!</p><p></p><p>"Haha, great! Wonderful!" </p><p></p><p>Ouyang Nuo laughed wildly, then looked at the Fu Clan in front of him and shouted loudly:</p><p></p><p>"Since this Fu Liangcai is so unreasonable, then today the entire Fu Clan... will be wiped out without leaving a single chicken or dog!!"</p><p></p><p>Ouyang Nuo's loud shout was very resonant, </p><p></p><p>even Li Shuyan, who was dozing off in the guest room outside, heard it.</p><p></p><p>He coughed awkwardly and looked fearfully at the room...</p><p>This person is arrogant, a real "wiping out without leaving a single chicken or dog".</p><p></p><p>At the same time!</p><p></p><p>Fu Liangcai's loud shout also echoed in this space: "Activate the Clan Defense Formation!"</p><p></p><p>"Rumble—Whoosh!"</p><p></p><p>Accompanied by countless multicolored light beams shooting in all directions of the Fu Clan, intersecting with each other, a thick barrier quickly formed like a giant bowl covering the Fu Clan.</p><p></p><p>Ouyang Nuo saw this scene, his heart slightly constricted. He was very familiar with the Clan Defense Formation, his Ouyang Clan also had one.</p><p></p><p>It's precisely because he's familiar with it that he knows how difficult it is to break.</p><p></p><p>Strange, what is that Liu Qing fellow doing? He hasn't arrived yet, and if it weren't for waiting for Liu Qing, he would have started the attack long ago!!</p><p></p><p>Just then, several Liu Clan elders led a group of Liu Clan disciples, including Liu Xing, finally arrived.</p><p></p><p>"Where's Liu Qing? What are you Liu Clan up to?" </p><p></p><p>Ouyang Nuo's heart relaxed a bit when he saw this, and he immediately frowned and shouted.</p><p></p><p>"Clan Leader Ouyang, sorry about that, our clan had a bit of a situation, and the Clan Leader is still dealing with it, so he asked us and the Young Master to come first. He said he'll hurry over as soon as he's done." The Liu Clan elder said apologetically with a bow.</p><p></p><p>"That Liu Qing fellow, really dropping the ball at a critical moment." Ouyang Nuo snorted coldly, waving his hand, "Nevermind, we won't wait for him anymore. Attacking this Clan Defense Formation will take a bit more time without him, but it's no big deal."</p><p></p><p>"However, I'll tell you all, if Liu Qing is late, when it's time to divide the spoils of the Fu Clan, your Liu Clan will get one-tenth less!"</p><p></p><p>The few Liu Clan elders' expressions changed slightly, with some subtle discontent.</p><p></p><p>"Hmph." Ouyang Nuo coldly snorted on the surface, but was actually laughing inwardly.</p><p></p><p>Liu Qing, don't blame me, this one-tenth is something you let slip yourself.</p><p></p><p>The next moment, he suddenly soared into the air, his robe fluttering.</p><p></p><p>Here is the full English translation of the Chinese excerpt:</p><p></p><p>Glaring at the grand formation, he roared, "Destroy the formation for our clan!!!"</p><p></p><p>"Yes!!!"</p><p></p><p>The members of the four clans all rose into the air, and with a thunderous boom, a violent wave of energy erupted from them!</p><p></p><p>In an instant, the entire space was shrouded in darkness!</p><p></p><p>The countless cultivators watching from afar felt their breathing becoming somewhat labored, as the waves of energy erupting from so many people compressed and oppressed them, making them feel uncomfortable.</p><p></p><p>Ouyang Nuo clenched his fist tightly, and a golden glow enveloped his knuckles, shining brilliantly.</p><p></p><p>Xu Chong, Gao Teng, and the others saw this and also began to circulate the energy within their bodies, preparing to unleash their techniques.</p><p></p><p>In a moment, dazzling multicolored lights burst forth from their bodies.</p><p></p><p>Soon, Ouyang Nuo's glowing fists heavily struck the formation, accompanied by a fierce roar: "Shocking Mysterious Violent Fist!!!"</p><p></p><p>Two golden beam-like fist energies shot out from his fists, forming two laser-like attacks, the fist shadows within them almost impossible for the naked eye to capture.</p><p></p><p>Seeing this, Xu Chong, Gao Teng, and the others also unleashed their techniques.</p><p></p><p>Many techniques instantly followed the two holographic attacks and struck the formation!</p><p></p><p>"Rumble—"</p><p></p><p>Violent spiritual power instantly filled the heavens and earth, causing the entire Fu Clan's territory to tremble and sway!</p><p></p><p>"Poof!"</p><p></p><p>Countless Fu Clan disciples standing in the formation positions simultaneously coughed up a mouthful of fresh blood, their faces turning deathly pale in an instant.</p><p></p><p>Fu Liancai and the others had unsightly expressions, with a hint of hopelessness appearing in their eyes.</p><p></p><p>Today, their Fu Clan was truly about to perish.</p><p></p><p>Boom! Boom! Boom!!</p><p></p><p>Wave after wave of attacks pounded the Fu Clan's formation, and gradually, the formation began to show fine cracks.</p><p></p><p>It gave the impression that it could shatter at any moment, utterly shocking and terrifying.</p><p></p><p>"Haha haha, Fu Liancai! What are you still persisting for?!"</p><p></p><p>"Your Fu Clan disciples are truly pitiful, following such a useless clan leader!"</p><p></p><p>"The Fu Clan has prospered for so long, yet it is about to be defeated by you, the current clan leader. Aren't you feeling anguished in your heart?"</p><p></p><p>Outside, Ouyang Nuo's taunts came one after another.</p><p></p><p>Fu Liancai clenched his fists tightly, and a terrifying bloodiness shrouded his eyes! He had been provoked!</p><p></p><p>"Rumble!"</p><p></p><p>At this moment, the formation suddenly shattered and dissipated, not even lasting long from the initial attack.</p><p></p><p>Fu Liancai's eyes turned red, and he roared, "Fu Clan disciples, hear my command, follow your clan leader and kill!!!"</p><p></p><p>"Kill!!!"</p><p></p><p>At the same time,</p><p></p><p>In the guest room, Lu Changsheng opened the door and walked out, his expression somewhat unpleasant.</p><p></p><p>Li Shuyan was startled and quickly bowed, stammering, "Sir, you... you..."</p><p></p><p>Lu Changsheng glanced at him and said, "Shuyan, although your strength is a bit stronger than the old turtle's, your perceptiveness is not as good as his."</p><p></p><p>Li Shuyan was taken aback, looking puzzled.</p><p></p><p>"If it were the old turtle, with all the commotion outside, he would have rushed out to handle it long ago," Lu Changsheng said casually.</p><p></p><p>Li Shuyan's face flushed, suddenly feeling that he still had a lot to learn.</p><p></p><p>He quickly said, "Sir, Shuyan will go take care of it!!"</p><p></p><p>With that, he rushed out frantically, so panicked that he even forgot to use his movement techniques to speed up.</p><p></p><p>"Sigh," Lu Changsheng looked at Li Shuyan's retreating figure and smiled as he went back into the room.</p><p></p><p>.........</p><p></p><p>Rumble!!</p><p></p><p>The battlefield outside had already descended into chaos!</p><p></p><p>Fu Liancai was facing off against Ouyang Nuo, Xu Chong, and Gao Teng, seemingly trying to take on the three of them alone.</p><p></p><p>"Fu Liancai, kneel down and call me 'Father', and I might just spare you today," Ouyang Nuo said in a mocking tone.</p><p></p><p>"Fuck off!" Fu Liancai, already enraged to the core, charged at him without hesitation.</p><p></p><p>"Hmph! Xu Clan Leader, Gao Clan Leader, follow me and kill him! Quick, decisive victory!" Ouyang Nuo's fists glowed with golden light as he coldly smiled.</p><p></p><p>But just at that moment, a panicked shout from the Ouyang Clan's Grand Elder below the battlefield rang out.</p><p></p><p>"Clan, Clan Leader! An urgent message from the clan! Liu Qing Clan Leader and the Liu Clan's Ancestor have led the Liu Clan disciples to attack our Ouyang Clan!!!"</p><p></p><p>A deathly silence fell upon the battlefield...</p><p></p><p>The fighting had paused for a moment.</p><p></p><p>Ouyang Nuo's smile froze on his face, and his eyes instantly turned bloodshot as an endless fury erupted.</p><p></p><p>"Liu Qing!! You bastard!!!"</p>

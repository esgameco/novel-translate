        <h1>Chapter 269</h1>
        <div class="content">
            <p>Here is the full English translation of the Chinese excerpt:</p><p></p><p>In the dark and endless void,</p><p></p><p>There were four figures flitting about. They were like dust, no, even less than dust.</p><p></p><p>If the field of vision was not zoomed in, nothing could be seen in this void.</p><p></p><p>At the forefront, Lu Changsheng stood with his hands behind his back, his gaze unwavering.</p><p></p><p>Old Turtle had a smiling face, and it wasn't too bad, as he had seen a lot in his life and was not too shaken.</p><p></p><p>But Li Shuyan and Tong Xin were stunned.</p><p></p><p>They stared blankly at the deep, endless void, and the myriad twinkling stars deeply pierced their nerves.</p><p></p><p>They had never felt as small and insignificant as dust before.</p><p></p><p>"This, this is where?" Li Shuyan asked in a trembling voice, his complexion a bit off. His state was more exaggerated than Tong Xin's, as if he was about to lose control.</p><p></p><p>All along, he had only passed through a few channels to visit a couple of small worlds in the Ancestral Heavenly Realm. He had never seen such a magnificent and shocking scene!</p><p></p><p>Old Turtle frowned and quickly looked at the back of Lu Changsheng: "Master, Li Shuyan's condition seems a bit off!"</p><p></p><p>Lu Changsheng turned around and looked at Li Shuyan, lightly pointing a finger at him from a distance.</p><p></p><p>"Cough!"</p><p></p><p>Li Shuyan's body suddenly felt as if it had been struck by a huge hammer, and he bent over, panting heavily, his eyes filled with fear.</p><p></p><p>However, his complexion was much better than before.</p><p></p><p>"Master, what's wrong with Li Shuyan?" Old Turtle asked puzzledly.</p><p></p><p>Tong Xin also came to his senses and looked at him with doubt.</p><p></p><p>Lu Changsheng shook his head and smiled: "His Dao heart is not firmly established, and he almost lost control."</p><p></p><p>Dao heart not firmly established?</p><p></p><p>Old Turtle looked suspiciously at the still-panting Li Shuyan.</p><p></p><p>Lu Changsheng explained, "He saw the endless void and felt awe and fear, feeling that after cultivating for so many years, he is still no better than dust, that it was all in vain."</p><p></p><p>"He thought about what the purpose of his cultivation has been all along, in short, his thoughts were trapped in a dead end."</p><p></p><p>Old Turtle and Tong Xin suddenly understood, but they could not empathize.</p><p></p><p>"Uh, Master, why is Tong Xin fine?" Old Turtle suddenly glanced at Tong Xin and asked.</p><p></p><p>Yeah, why am I okay? Am I exceptionally gifted? Haha!</p><p></p><p>Tong Xin was also taken aback, feeling a little pleased in his heart.</p><p></p><p>But Lu Changsheng's next words made him blush.</p><p></p><p>"Tong Xin's tiny cultivation and mentality are nothing compared to Li Shuyan's. He is just a young disciple who has only cultivated for a short time, how can he be compared to Li Shuyan, who was previously a Mirror Observation Buddha Master in the Ancestral Heavenly Realm?"</p><p></p><p>"Cough cough cough, the master is right," Tong Xin said with an embarrassed laugh.</p><p></p><p>The master was telling the truth. What was Tong Xin compared to Li Shuyan, who could even arm-wrestle with Immortal Emperors?</p><p></p><p>"Haha, so that's how it is," Old Turtle said meaningfully, patting Tong Xin's shoulder to comfort him: "Tong Xin, don't be discouraged, Grandpa Turtle believes that in ten thousand years, you will still be a waste."</p><p></p><p>Tong Xin's heart had just warmed up, but when he heard the last part, his face fell.</p><p></p><p>Was there such a way to comfort someone?</p><p></p><p>Grandpa Turtle, no, that old rascal was really bad.</p><p></p><p>"Phew." At this moment, Li Shuyan straightened up, his heart still pounding: "Master, you are right. Thank you for your timely intervention, or else I would have been lost."</p><p></p><p>After following Lu Changsheng, Li Shuyan had also changed the way he addressed him.</p><p></p><p>Lu Changsheng looked at him, "And now?"</p><p></p><p>What now? Old Turtle and Tong Xin were puzzled.</p><p></p><p>Li Shuyan pursed his lips and smiled, bowing to the Azure Robe, then boldly surveying the endless void and the twinkling stars, saying:</p><p></p><p>"Master, thanks to you, I now understand that we cultivators should dare to contend with Heaven, contend with Earth, and contend with ourselves, and not be intimidated by the endless void."</p><p></p><p>Old Turtle and Tong Xin listened in awe.</p><p></p><p>Here is the full English translation of the Chinese excerpt:</p><p></p><p>Li Shuyan's previous identity was actually that of a Buddhist monk, he had some abilities!</p><p></p><p>Go to the new 69 book â†’ 69shux.com</p><p></p><p>No wonder the master was willing to let him follow, Li Shuyan's natural talent, insight, and even temperament, if cultivated, would be formidable.</p><p></p><p>Lu Changsheng's eyes flashed with a trace of laughter, and he nodded slightly: "Why be afraid of the boundless void, what you said is excellent."</p><p></p><p>After saying that, he suddenly turned around, looking at the boundless void, and said faintly:</p><p></p><p>"A spark can set the prairie ablaze... Although I am as insignificant as dust, there will come a day when I can tear through the endless void."</p><p></p><p>Boom!!</p><p></p><p>Hearing the calm yet domineering words, the minds of the three old turtles were suddenly shaken, stirring up a storm.</p><p></p><p>Their souls could not help but tremble, as if something was being sublimated at that moment, or as if they had suddenly been transported from the darkness into the world of light!</p><p></p><p>After a moment, the three of them snapped back to their senses, feeling that their state of mind was completely different!</p><p></p><p>If in the past it was indifference or awe, fear of the boundless void, then now... they were no longer afraid at all, and even had a surge of hot blood, really wanting to tear it apart!</p><p></p><p>At this time, Lu Changsheng glanced at the three of them,</p><p></p><p>His words were not meant to make them become blindly arrogant.</p><p></p><p>"Cough cough cough."</p><p></p><p>The three hurriedly coughed, forcibly suppressing the hot blood in their hearts, and detaching themselves from the state of blind arrogance.</p><p></p><p>"You few drunken fools, wanting to tear through the boundless void? My words were just to strengthen your Dao heart, don't get lost in a way that I can't understand."  Lu Changsheng looked at them strangely.</p><p></p><p>"Yes, yes, yes." The three hurriedly nodded.</p><p></p><p>"Old Turtle."</p><p></p><p>"Ah, master, I'm here!"</p><p></p><p>"Do you see the world ahead?"</p><p></p><p>"Yes, I see it, master, what do you mean?"</p><p></p><p>"That is Linglang Heaven, I've built a sect there."</p><p></p><p>"Ah? So that's Linglang Heaven?" At this point, Tongxin exclaimed in surprise.</p><p></p><p>Old Turtle glared at Tongxin, eagerly asking, "Master, what do you mean?"</p><p></p><p>"The opponents I'm about to face, and the situation may be a bit complicated, you and Tongxin are too weak, so just stay in the sect and cultivate diligently."</p><p></p><p>"Ah? Master, Tongxin wants to continue following you, Tongxin's current cultivation will be mocked by Lin Dong if I return to the sect!"</p><p></p><p>"Master, are you going to abandon Old Turtle again?"</p><p></p><p>"Are you going to be a burden? If you weren't so lazy and lustful every day, and put more effort into your cultivation, you would at least be stronger than most people. As an Immortal Turtle, your cultivation is even weaker than Li Shuyan's, isn't that embarrassing?"</p><p></p><p>Old Turtle: "......"</p><p></p><p>Li Shuyan: "......"</p><p></p><p>Although the master was admonishing Old Turtle, Li Shuyan didn't know why, but he also felt a bit uncomfortable, as if something was wrong.</p><p></p><p>"Master, Old Turtle still wants to..."</p><p></p><p>"No more nonsense, or your turtle shell will be gone."</p><p></p><p>"......"</p><p></p><p>The next moment.</p><p></p><p>Lu Changsheng suddenly waved his sleeve!</p><p></p><p>An irresistible force suddenly erupted, violently pushing the bewildered Old Turtle and Tongxin towards Linglang Heaven!</p><p></p><p>"Ah ah ah ah ah!"</p><p></p><p>The two of them screamed as they disappeared from sight in a flash of light.</p><p></p><p>Li Shuyan stared blankly, swallowing hard.</p><p></p><p>At the same time,</p><p></p><p>In Linglang Heaven, Canglan Zhou, the location of the Xiaoyao Sect.</p><p></p><p>The sky suddenly erupted with a piercing wail!</p><p></p><p>"Ah ah ah ah ah ah!!!"</p><p></p><p>The Xiaoyao Sect immediately became restless.</p><p></p><p>Peng Fang and the group of elders who were happily drinking, the next moment had the alcohol suddenly spraying out of their mouths!</p><p></p><p>They looked up in disbelief,</p><p></p><p>Who the hell had the guts to attack their Xiaoyao Sect?</p><p></p><p>Don't they know who the sect master is?!</p><p></p><p>In a flash of lightning, many servants wielding long swords or blades rushed fiercely towards the sky!</p><p></p><p>"Enemy attack! Kill the invading enemy!!"</p>

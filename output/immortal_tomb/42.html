        <h1>Chapter 42</h1>
        <div class="content">
            <p>Here is the full English translation of the Chinese excerpt:</p><p></p><p>Upon hearing this,</p><p></p><p>The old hunchbacked man let out a bitter sigh, </p><p></p><p>"Fellow Daoist Jiang has overestimated me. When the heavenly tribulation arrives, whether I can safely pass through it is still unknown. It is still too early to talk about transcendence now. üêöüê†‚ùªÔºôùì¢ƒßÔºµœá.·∂ú„Ññ·µê‚òûüêß"</p><p></p><p>If he could safely pass through it, the gates of the transcendence channel would open.</p><p></p><p>If he could not, then he would most likely perish in the heavenly tribulation.</p><p></p><p>The path of cultivation is long and arduous, in the end, it may all be in vain.</p><p></p><p>Hearing this, the middle-aged man surnamed Jiang chuckled, and the other cultivators present also remained silent.</p><p></p><p>Cultivating immortality is indeed this cruel.</p><p></p><p>"Alright everyone, since we haven't found anything unusual at the transcendence channel, let's disperse. I still have some elixirs to refine, I'll take my leave first."</p><p></p><p>The old hunchbacked man finished speaking, cupped his hands and disappeared.</p><p></p><p>"That strange howling sound has left no trace, but since the transcendence channel is normal, I'll take my leave."</p><p></p><p>Soon, the Immortal Miss Qin and the middle-aged man surnamed Jiang also cupped their hands and departed.</p><p></p><p>As the cultivators gradually dispersed, the area outside the transcendence channel quickly became empty.</p><p></p><p>..........</p><p></p><p>Maoyu Town.</p><p></p><p>"Town Master, this..." The steward was perplexed.</p><p></p><p>Were these demonic beasts playing tricks on them?</p><p></p><p>Just a moment ago, they were charging in fiercely, how come they suddenly withdrew?</p><p></p><p>Could it be that the howling sound from the horizon just now was their leader calling them back home for a meal...</p><p></p><p>Chen Dadao heaved a long sigh of relief and said, "It should be related to that howling sound just now."</p><p></p><p>The steward nodded, agreeing with his guess, this was the most likely possibility.</p><p></p><p>"Instruct the people, say that the demonic beasts have retreated, so the townspeople don't need to be anxious."</p><p></p><p>Chen Dadao said a sentence and headed towards the town master's manor, his figure looking somewhat dejected.</p><p></p><p>A few days later.</p><p></p><p>The group from Qingyun Sect arrived at the Lishui Empire, they originally thought that the Lishui Empire had already suffered.</p><p></p><p>After all, the Lishui Empire was located in the eastern part of the Eastern Domain, the journey was quite far, and it took them a lot of time to get here.</p><p></p><p>But when they saw the current state of the Lishui Empire, they were surprised.</p><p></p><p>Weren't there supposed to be many demonic beasts attacking?</p><p></p><p>Afterwards, Elder Guhelin summoned the disciples of Qingyun Sect stationed here and asked about the situation. </p><p></p><p>He heaved a sigh of relief.</p><p></p><p>The demonic beasts did attack, but later they mysteriously retreated, they guessed it might be related to the howling sound that day.</p><p></p><p>Guhelin waved his hand, a talisman appeared, he infused spiritual power into it and said solemnly, "Sect Master, after five years, they should be causing trouble again. Just in case, you should discuss with the Elders about sending more people to Lishui, and Elder Gu suspects that the demonic and evil realms may have formed an alliance."</p><p></p><p>As he finished speaking, the talisman in his hand suddenly burst into flames and turned to ash.</p><p></p><p>"Tongxin, you go find a place to stay with the disciples first, I'm going to see the Senior."</p><p></p><p>Tongxin said pitifully, "Ah, Master, can I go with you? It's been a while since I've seen the Senior."</p><p></p><p>"I have important matters to attend to, that's it." Guhelin glanced at him and flew away.</p><p></p><p>Tongxin: "Ah."</p><p></p><p>..........</p><p></p><p>"How dare you sigh? Useless."</p><p></p><p>The Venomous Snake Demon King Lieteng looked at the two demonic beasts kneeling before him indifferently.</p><p></p><p>"Demon King Lieteng, please forgive us!" </p><p></p><p>The two demonic beasts said fearfully.</p><p></p><p>Their body sizes were huge, kneeling in front of Lieteng, they looked like two small hills, making Lieteng seem rather diminutive.</p><p></p><p>The demonic beasts of the Demon Realm and the monsters of the Evil Realm, in order to take on a humanoid form, they must at least reach a realm similar to the Nascent Soul stage of human cultivators, that is, the Eighth Level.</p><p></p><p>Here is the full English translation of the Chinese excerpt:</p><p></p><p>"The first wave ended in failure. Do you all consider yourselves to be useless?" </p><p></p><p>Lie Tengsha said with slight displeasure.</p><p></p><p>If this matter were to be known by that idiot Zhao Shenyuan, it would undoubtedly invite another round of cold ridicule, how detestable.</p><p></p><p>"Your Majesty the Demon King, you do not know, on that day, a cry unlike that of a human suddenly came from the horizon of the Lishui Empire. That in itself was not a big deal, but the most terrifying thing was that this cry filled us with great fear. There seemed to be a terrifying oppressive force in it, as if the blood in our veins was about to congeal. We, we retreated."</p><p></p><p>A demonic beast reported in a trembling voice, still with lingering fear.</p><p></p><p>"Oh?" Lie Tengsha questioned, "Where did that sound come from?"</p><p></p><p>"I, I don't know, that sound disappeared in an instant," the demonic beast said trembling.</p><p></p><p>"If it disappeared in an instant, why did you still run?" Lie Tengsha coldly shouted, his eyes filled with murderous intent! He was thoroughly displeased.</p><p></p><p>This really frightened the two demonic beasts, "Demon King Tengsha, we, we... no, no!"</p><p></p><p>Lie Tengsha suddenly opened his mouth wide and directly swallowed the two demonic beasts whole!</p><p></p><p>A moment later, Lie Tengsha "ptooied" and frowned disdainfully, "How unpalatable."</p><p></p><p>"Let Tianlang and Cizhu come see this king."</p><p></p><p>At the same time, in the Demon Sovereign's Palace.</p><p></p><p>"Jiwuqing, what are you hesitating about? Five years ago, this sovereign thought you were going to make a move against the Lingchen Immortal Cultivation Realm, why have you dragged it out until now?"</p><p></p><p>A middle-aged man with a full beard looked at the black-robed woman with a veil covering her face and asked in a stern voice.</p><p></p><p>"Huzhang, you don't know, five years ago this sovereign went to an immortal tomb, where a tomb had mysteriously disappeared."  Jiwuqing shook her head.</p><p></p><p>Huzhang's pupils shrank sharply, shaken, "You must be mistaken, in the past ten thousand years, no one has been able to shake the immortal tombs in the slightest, how could one have disappeared?"</p><p></p><p>"But it did disappear, you can go and see for yourself." Jiwuqing did not want to explain further, she did not know how to explain it either.</p><p></p><p>Seeing Jiwuqing's certainty, Huzhang's heart tightened as he asked, "So this whole time, you haven't launched a full-scale attack on the Lingchen Immortal Cultivation Realm, just because of this?"</p><p></p><p>Jiwuqing nodded and said, "That's right, this matter has given this sovereign an extremely strange feeling, as you know, this sovereign has always been cautious."</p><p></p><p>Huzhang paused, then said in a low voice, "Then if you never find out the reason for that tomb's disappearance, will you just keep hesitating and not make a move? If so, what's the point of our two realms forming an alliance?"</p><p></p><p>He didn't have much time to waste, his realm was also about to reach a bottleneck, and he was also very eager to know the secrets of the immortal tomb!</p><p></p><p>"Ten years, in the next ten years, if the situation remains normal, we'll go to war with the Lingchen Realm." Jiwuqing said indifferently, "Before that, let's just have some minor skirmishes down below."</p><p></p><p>Ten years, huh...</p><p></p><p>Huzhang frowned and thought for a while, then nodded and said, "Alright, ten years it is, after all, it's not long. This sovereign agrees."</p><p></p><p>Jiwuqing nodded slightly, her gaze flickering as her figure faded.</p><p></p><p>She was preparing to go back to the Lingchen Realm near the Lishui area, and spend ten years searching for the reason behind the disappearance of that tomb...</p><p></p><p>Seeing Jiwuqing leave, Huzhang rubbed his chin, his brow furrowed, "A tomb has disappeared into thin air? How is that possible? This sovereign should go and take a look himself!"</p><p></p><p>Even though he believed what Jiwuqing said, he still wanted to see it for himself.</p><p></p><p>If a tomb really did disappear...</p><p></p><p>For some reason, Huzhang suddenly felt a chill down his spine!</p>

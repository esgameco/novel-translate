        <h1>Chapter 375</h1>
        <div class="content">
            <p>Here is the full English translation of the Chinese excerpt:</p><p></p><p>"Lord Sword Sovereign, this method is truly marvelous!" </p><p></p><p>Mantiankong stood up and clapped his hands excitedly. The others also revealed relieved smiles on their faces. If the Sword Sovereign could do this, perhaps the human race could safely weather this great calamity!</p><p></p><p>Although they could not preserve all 16,666 Jade Hearts, being able to keep 7,666 was already excellent! After all, in the past, the human race had never even obtained a fraction of that amount of Jade Hearts.</p><p></p><p>Jiang Wuxin slowly rose to his feet and said with a slight frown, "Lord Sword Sovereign, this method is good, but what about the other races that rank lower than us? Won't they be left with nothing?"</p><p></p><p>Hearing this, the crowd fell silent for a moment. </p><p></p><p>Jian Wuhui paused briefly before softly saying, "Wind Venerable, your compassion is admirable, but we must first ensure the survival of our own race. This method is the only way to preserve the greatest interests of the human race..."</p><p></p><p>"This method can only work through the strong subjugating the weak. Are we really going to distribute the Jade Hearts to the races ranked below us? If we do that, can those lower races help us withstand the pressure from the top hundred clans?"</p><p></p><p>"Even if we give the Jade Hearts to the top hundred clans, the remaining 7,666 would still not be enough to be divided among all the races. And even if we divide them evenly, the human race would still face annihilation in the end."</p><p></p><p>"I'm sure you all can foresee these consequences."</p><p></p><p>"The Sword Sovereign speaks the truth," Jiang Wuxin said no more, knowing that he had indeed been overly compassionate.</p><p></p><p>The Sword Sovereign was right - to preserve the human race, it was better to give more to the top hundred clans, using the strong to subdue the weak, rather than dividing the resources equally among all the races.</p><p></p><p>At this point, Yan Jueyi asked, "Lord Sword Sovereign, how shall we deliver the Jade Hearts to the top hundred clans then?"</p><p></p><p>It was not feasible to send people individually, as it would be dangerous, not to mention that many of the great clans were located far from the human race.</p><p></p><p>Jian Wuhui shook his head: "We cannot send them now. Whether we have enough time is another matter, but the most important thing is that if the ones sent to deliver the Jade Hearts have their souls searched, then the human race will be utterly doomed."</p><p></p><p>The crowd fell silent, realizing the gravity of the situation. What they had discussed earlier sounded simple, but the actual implementation was extremely difficult.</p><p></p><p>"Then what should we do?" Yan Jueyi asked, perplexed.</p><p></p><p>Jian Wuhui said solemnly, "We need not hurry to send out the Jade Hearts. We will wait until the day when all the races surround our human race..."</p><p></p><p>Hearing this, the crowd felt a chill in their souls. The encirclement of all the races...just the thought of it was terrifying.</p><p></p><p>At this moment, Han Jinlong softly inquired, "Lord Sword Sovereign, even if the other races do not know how many Jade Hearts we possess, as you mentioned, if they decide to search our souls, what shall we do then?"</p><p></p><p>Before that happened, they needed to consider every possible contingency and prepare accordingly.</p><p></p><p>The hall fell silent for a moment.</p><p></p><p>Then Jian Wuhui spoke again, "When that time comes, even if they search your souls, they will most likely target one of you. I have a method that can erase your memories regarding the number of Jade Hearts, though it will cause a slight pain."</p><p></p><p>The crowd was overjoyed. Of course they could endure a bit of pain if it meant the Sword Sovereign had a solution.</p><p></p><p>Seeing their reaction, Jian Wuhui nodded slightly and called out, "Hongyan."</p><p></p><p>In the next moment, the crowd saw a beam of red light enter the hall and transform into a beautiful woman.</p><p></p><p>The people looked at the woman in puzzlement. They recognized her as the Sword Sovereign's mount, but they did not understand why she was involved in erasing their memories.</p><p></p><p>Here is the full English translation of the Chinese excerpt:</p><p></p><p>Everyone closed their eyes.</p><p></p><p>Jian Wuhui looked at the crowd and instructed, "Close your eyes."</p><p></p><p>The crowd knew that the Sect Master was about to begin, so they quickly obeyed and closed their eyes.</p><p></p><p>Jian Wuhui looked at Hong Yun and said, "Hong Yun, can you erase their memories of the exact number of Liuli Hearts?"</p><p></p><p>"Master, don't worry, it's a trivial matter," Hong Yun smiled and gently waved her red sleeve. Countless red specks of light appeared in the hall and then slowly floated towards the heads of the crowd, disappearing into them.</p><p></p><p>"Ahâ€”!"</p><p></p><p>Suddenly, there were cries of pain throughout the hall. Even the four Overlords like Jiang Wuxin had pale faces, feeling a sharp piercing sensation in their minds that made them very uncomfortable.</p><p></p><p>Jian Wuhui looked at the pained crowd and nodded slightly, then sat down and waited in silence.</p><p></p><p>After a moment, the crowd opened their eyes and looked at Jian Wuhui.</p><p></p><p>Jian Wuhui looked at Hong Yun and transmitted a message, "Hong Yun, help me with something, go out and notify the three major cities that from now on, no one is allowed to mention the number of Liuli Hearts."</p><p></p><p>Hong Yun nodded lightly and disappeared in a flash of red light.</p><p></p><p>Jian Wuhui slowly stood up: "The four Overlords, guard your respective major cities, and I will return to the Heavenly City."</p><p></p><p>"Mm."</p><p></p><p>...</p><p></p><p>A few days later.</p><p></p><p>The Divine-Demon Battlefield was in turmoil.</p><p></p><p>With the return of the various tribes, the events surrounding the Seven-Colored Liuli Tower quickly spread across the Divine-Demon Battlefield.</p><p></p><p>Countless eyes were now focused on the southeast direction of the Divine-Demon Battlefield, which was the territory of the Human Tribe.</p><p></p><p>Immediately, all the tribes began to mobilize. After completing their preparations, they quietly waited in their tribes.</p><p></p><p>They were waiting for the movements of the top hundred tribes, or even the top ten peak tribes.</p><p></p><p>As soon as the top ten tribes made a move, they would immediately set out!</p><p></p><p>Although the Human Tribe ranked only in the thousands, it was not an ordinary tribe, with five Overlords and the existence of the Annihilation Sword Sect Master. If not for certain special circumstances, the Human Tribe's ranking on the Tribes Ranking would not be much lower than some of the top hundred major tribes.</p><p></p><p>In fact, there were dozens of tribes that already had grievances with the Human Tribe, and they were now on their way to the Human Tribe's territory.</p><p></p><p>For example, the leading Viper Tribe...</p><p></p><p>They already had a grudge, and now with the Liuli Tower incident, where their Holy Son Yousen was defeated by the Human Tribe, it was a grudge upon a grudge!</p><p></p><p>At the same time, the Heavenly God Tribe, the Devouring Beast Tribe, the Dragon Tribe, the Fire Phoenix Tribe, the White Tiger Tribe, and other top ten peak tribes also began to make moves.</p><p></p><p>Of course, when facing the Human Tribe, their tribal leaders would naturally not take the field themselves. At most, they would send elders, holy sons, holy daughters, and some powerful experts.</p><p></p><p>For these top-tier figures to go to the Human Tribe, they had more than enough strength.</p><p></p><p>If the leaders of the top ten peak tribes personally descended upon the Human Tribe, that would be too undignified.</p><p></p><p>The movements of the top ten peak tribes were quickly noticed by all the tribes!</p><p></p><p>Suddenly, from all directions of the Divine-Demon Battlefield, countless teams were heading towards the southeast, towards the territory of the Human Tribe!</p><p></p><p>At the same time, in the Great Dao Demon-Subduing Tower.</p><p></p><p>Lu Changsheng looked at the last chain on the boy's wrist, and under the boy's expectant gaze, he raised the boy's hand, pinched the chain between his thumb and forefinger, and gave a light tug.</p><p></p><p>With a 'clang' sound, the chain broke.</p><p></p><p>Immediately, the Great Dao Demon-Subduing Tower began to shake violently!</p><p></p><p>The boy clenched his fists, his face twisted into a ferocious smile, filled with arrogance!</p><p></p><p>"Hahaha, the myriad worlds, the calamitous demon, has returned!!"</p><p></p><p>Lu Changsheng stood still, stroking his chin, silently watching the crazed boy, lost in thought.</p><p></p><p>At that moment, the boy's laughter suddenly stopped, his eyes fixed on Lu Changsheng, filled with bloodlust!!</p><p></p><p>Lu Changsheng raised his eyebrows, with an amused expression, "Looking for a fight?"</p>

        <h1>Chapter 381</h1>
        <div class="content">
            <p>Here is the full English translation of the Chinese excerpt:</p><p></p><p>After a moment of silence, the fury in the hearts of the powerful experts from the myriad tribes burned even more intensely!</p><p></p><p>How dare he...?!</p><p></p><p>Among the forces of the myriad tribes, many powerful experts were itching to rush up and tear Lu Changsheng apart right then and there.</p><p></p><p>But constrained by the fact that the top ten apex clans had not yet spoken, they did not dare to act rashly.</p><p></p><p>Of course, the most important thing was that while they were furious, they were not fools.</p><p></p><p>The scene of the Third Divine Official having his fingers snapped was still fresh in their minds.</p><p></p><p>No one wanted to be the first to suffer such a fate.</p><p></p><p>Unless the apex clans gave the order, they could all rush up together!</p><p></p><p>The annihilation of the human race would only take a few breaths.</p><p></p><p>Clap, clap, clap...</p><p></p><p>Suddenly, the rhythmic sound of applause rang out, and the powerful experts of the myriad tribes looked over to see the clapper - it was Shen Luo.</p><p></p><p>Shen Luo lowered his hands, his gaze somewhat mocking as he looked at Lu Changsheng, his tone carrying a hint of coldness:</p><p></p><p>"Hehe, how interesting, truly interesting."</p><p></p><p>Ao Xing glanced at Shen Luo, then looked at Lu Changsheng, his eyes flickering.</p><p></p><p>If he was not mistaken, this Lu Nan was a disguised person, and the name might even be fake.</p><p></p><p>This was because he had suddenly remembered the trio he had seen in the war mist before.</p><p></p><p>An unfathomable human youth in azure robes, a stooped old man, and a young bald man.</p><p></p><p>Connecting the dots, Ao Xing thought of many possibilities.</p><p></p><p>It couldn't be just a coincidence.</p><p></p><p>He remembered that he had told his subordinates back then that in addition to the Extinguishing Heavenly Sword Saint, the human race had gained another powerful expert on the rankings.</p><p></p><p>"My divine son knows why you dare to be so arrogant, it's simply because the Luster Heart is in the hands of your human race, am I right?" </p><p></p><p>Shen Luo looked at the silent azure-robed man and asked.</p><p></p><p>Lu Changsheng seemed to have not heard, showing no intention of responding to Shen Luo, but instead swept his gaze across the powerful experts of the myriad tribes, asking:</p><p></p><p>"In that case, are you not going to leave?"</p><p></p><p>Seeing this, the hearts of the myriad tribe experts trembled, and they all looked towards Shen Luo.</p><p></p><p>Sure enough, they saw Shen Luo's face turn gloomy, even as black as ink!!</p><p></p><p>Instantly, the myriad tribe experts were excited, the divine son was angry, and it seemed they would soon take action!</p><p></p><p>"Insolent! Who gave you the audacity to ignore me, the divine son of the Heavenly God Tribe?!"</p><p></p><p>Shen Wei's eyes flashed with divine might as he suddenly roared out.</p><p></p><p>Shen Wei was actually wary of Lu Changsheng, but fortunately, there were enough powerful experts from the myriad tribes here.</p><p></p><p>Especially the top ten clans, whose high-level experts had come in varying numbers.</p><p></p><p>As long as everyone attacked together, the human race could be vaporized in an instant!</p><p></p><p>Lu Changsheng continued to ignore them, lightly saying with his hands behind his back:</p><p></p><p>"Ten breaths, I only give you ten breaths. After ten breaths, the tribes that remain in this place shall die."</p><p></p><p>Boom!!!</p><p></p><p>Though spoken calmly, these words ignited the entire mountain forest like a raging fire!!</p><p></p><p>Lu Changsheng: "One breath."</p><p></p><p>Seeing such arrogant behavior, Shen Luo finally could not hold back, erupting in furious rage:</p><p></p><p>"Despicable human! You disgusting reptile, who do you think you are?!"</p><p></p><p>"Take a good look at the top of your head, see who is ranked first among the myriad tribes?!"</p><p></p><p>"Do you really think that just because you possess the Luster Heart, the myriad tribes won't dare to attack? Even if we have to give up the Luster Heart! I don't believe your human race has the means to destroy the Luster Heart!"</p><p></p><p>"Kill him for me - annihilate the human race!!"</p><p></p><p>Boom!!!</p><p></p><p>Instantly, countless powerful experts from the myriad tribes surged forward like giant ocean waves towards the human race!!</p><p></p><p>Rumble rumble -</p><p></p><p>The momentum was grand, shaking the heavens and earth, even causing the entire human domain to tremble!</p><p></p><p>The war mist in this area was blown away completely by the fierce winds stirred up by the myriad tribe experts.</p><p></p><p>However, some of the lower-ranked tribes, such as the Fly Tribe, quietly retreated.</p><p></p><p>Seeing the azure-robed man standing calmly, they suddenly felt...</p><p></p><p>Here is the full English translation of the Chinese excerpt:</p><p></p><p>He wanted to get involved.</p><p></p><p>The most important thing was that even if the human race was destroyed today, the Liuli Heart... they, as a tiny and insignificant tribe, might not even get a single one.</p><p></p><p>Useless effort, unnecessary, they didn't want to gamble either.</p><p></p><p>"Ao Xing, aren't you going up?" </p><p></p><p>Bi Qiong looked at Ao Xing, the extremely powerful member of the Dragon Tribe, and asked puzzledly.</p><p></p><p>Ao Xing stared at the figure in blue in the distance, slowly shaking his head and saying, "I won't go up for now. Lu Nan is so confident, the human race may have some trump cards, let's let this guy Shen Luo go and probe first."</p><p></p><p>Bi Qiong was surprised to see Ao Xing, the holy son of the Dragon Tribe, being so cautious.</p><p></p><p>The situation was clearly one-sided, and under the onslaught of countless powerful experts from the myriad tribes, the human race had no chance of survival at all.</p><p></p><p>He then smiled and said, "Hehe, it doesn't matter anyway. In the end, if there is a Liuli Heart, it will still be ours. Let Shen Luo and the others do the hard work."</p><p></p><p>After saying that, he and Ao Xing retreated a little with their own tribesmen.</p><p></p><p>Shen Luo, Feng Jun, Bai Qian Mo and the others standing in place noticed this scene and felt somewhat disdainful in their hearts.</p><p></p><p>The Devour Beast Tribe and the Dragon Tribe, the second and third on the Myriad Tribes Ranking, yet they still wanted to fish in troubled waters, how laughable.</p><p></p><p>But they couldn't really say anything about it.</p><p></p><p>After all, their tribesmen were all following the powerful experts from the myriad tribes to press towards the human race's territory!</p><p></p><p>They only needed to stand with the elder-level figures next to them and watch the human race's destruction!</p><p></p><p>At the same time!</p><p></p><p>Among the myriad tribes' forces, Zi Xuan Yong, Xue Yue Ru and others were staring at the positions of Jiang Wuxin and Man Tian.</p><p></p><p>Zi Xuan Yong viciously transmitted to Xue Yue Ru and the others, "Later, the five of us will kill Jiang Wuxin and Man Tian as quickly as possible!!"</p><p></p><p>"Mm."</p><p></p><p>The five main figures of the human race and the core powerful experts of the human race all snapped back to their senses, their faces changing drastically!!!</p><p></p><p>They looked at the myriad tribes' powerful experts rushing towards them with a fierce momentum, densely packed, blocking out the sky - no exaggeration!</p><p></p><p>What could they use to block them...</p><p></p><p>Jian Wuhui's expression became stern, and a long sword suddenly appeared in his hand.</p><p></p><p>Han Jinlong summoned the Blazing Sun Heavenly Wheel, and a Mysterious Silver Shaking Heaven Cudgel appeared in Yan Jing's hand!</p><p></p><p>Jiang Wuxin's body was flickering with electric arcs, and lightning was surging from his feet.</p><p></p><p>Man Tian's muscles also bulged, ready to fight!</p><p></p><p>Even if they had no chance of winning, they would still fight!!</p><p></p><p>"Haha! My divine son sees what you humans can use to block us!!" </p><p></p><p>Shen Luo looked at the expressions of Jian Wuhui and the others from afar, his heart greatly elated, and he shouted fiercely.</p><p></p><p>With such a formation of powerful experts from the myriad tribes, such a number, even his Heavenly God Tribe would have great difficulty defending against them, let alone the human race. What qualifications did they have!</p><p></p><p>Jian Wuhui took a deep breath, and suddenly pointed his sword towards the sky and roared loudly:</p><p></p><p>"Human race, kill!!"</p><p></p><p>This roar echoed throughout the human race's territory, and the already prepared human race surged out from the Three Cities, vast in number!</p><p></p><p>The terrifying number was even greater than the powerful experts from the myriad tribes!</p><p></p><p>Unfortunately, the quantity was high, but the quality was vastly inferior!!</p><p></p><p>"Kill!!!"</p><p></p><p>The shrill cries filled with killing intent permeated the heavens and the earth!!</p><p></p><p>And just as the powerful experts from the myriad tribes and the human race were about to clash head-on!!</p><p></p><p>Standing at the forefront, facing the myriad tribes' powerful experts alone, Lu Changsheng's cold words thundered through the heavens and the earth:</p><p></p><p>"Ten breaths have passed, since you are so stubborn, then die."</p>

            <p>Here is the full English translation of the Chinese excerpt:</p><p></p><p>The City of Heavenly Fragrance.</p><p></p><p>On the shores of the secluded Pavilion Lake, a courtyard had appeared, no one knew when. In the bustling City of Heavenly Fragrance, hardly anyone had noticed it.</p><p></p><p>Even if they did notice, they would not be surprised, thinking it was just a wealthy family who admired the Immortal Musician buying a plot of land by the Pavilion Lake.</p><p></p><p>To wait for the next visit of the Immortal Musician and occupy the prime location to listen.</p><p></p><p>And at this moment, this courtyard was quite lively.</p><p></p><p>"Tong Xin, that area is a bit empty, go plant some flowers and plants there."</p><p></p><p>"Xiao Dong, for the pond over there, put in some rockeries and small fish fry."</p><p></p><p>"Da Dao, tidy up the backyard."</p><p></p><p>"Helin, and you few elders, are you just going to rely on your old age? Don't just stand idle, go work on the courtyard as well."</p><p></p><p>"......"</p><p></p><p>The old turtle walked with his hands behind his back, occasionally reaching out to point and gesture.</p><p></p><p>Indeed, Tong Xin and the others were all released by Lu Changsheng from the Great Dao Demon Pagoda.</p><p></p><p>After going through such a long period of cultivation in the Great Dao Demon Pagoda, their auras had all become more restrained, and no one knew what realm they had reached.</p><p></p><p>At first, when they were released by Lu Changsheng, they were completely dazed.</p><p></p><p>The saying "cultivation knows no time" was true, even they did not know how long it had been, a few years, decades, hundreds of years, or even thousands of years?</p><p></p><p>Until the old turtle told them that the outside world had already passed tens of thousands of years, and they were no longer on the Deity-Demon Battlefield, except for the elder Helin and Chen Dadao who had entered later, the rest were all stunned.</p><p></p><p>Terrifying indeed!</p><p></p><p>After a moment, the group had almost finished tidying up the entire courtyard and sat down together in the courtyard.</p><p></p><p>Except for the old turtle's mocking expression, Tong Xin and the others were dazed, still immersed in the terrifying passage of time, finding it difficult to recover.</p><p></p><p>"Tens of thousands of years, it really passed in the blink of an eye... I finally understand the ruthlessness of time," Peng Fang sighed as he patted his plump belly.</p><p></p><p>The others also nodded in agreement, as for the flow of time, they had not noticed it at all, and a hint of fear for the future appeared in their eyes.</p><p></p><p>In other words, even if they were diligent and cultivated tirelessly, they could never catch up with time, and would eventually be extinguished in the river of time, it was only a matter of time.</p><p></p><p>All things must perish, and no one can exist forever.</p><p></p><p>The old turtle sneered, "It's true that the outside world has passed tens of thousands of years, but the time you spent in the time-distorted Great Dao Demon Pagoda was probably far more than that."</p><p></p><p>Hearing this, the group was shaken again and could only smile bitterly.</p><p></p><p>Tong Xin scratched his head and suddenly asked, "By the way, Senior Turtle, what about the Deity-Demon Battlefield?"</p><p></p><p>The others also looked at the old turtle, but Helin and Chen Dadao were not very clear about the Deity-Demon Battlefield.</p><p></p><p>The old turtle waved his hand, "The Human Clan has risen to the top of the Myriad Clan Ranking, as for the former number one Deity Clan, it has already been destroyed by the Master in a flick of his hand, not worth mentioning."</p><p></p><p>The old turtle only briefly explained, not wanting to go into too many other details.</p><p></p><p>Hiss!</p><p></p><p>The group couldn't help but take a deep breath, at least in their impression, the Deity Clan was a massive force with countless powerful experts, and it was actually destroyed by the Patriarch just like that?</p><p></p><p>Helin and Chen Dadao silently exchanged a glance, their eyes filled with shock. They may not understand much, but they could still grasp that the Patriarch was as invincible as ever, no matter where he was.</p><p></p><p>Creak~</p><p></p><p>At this moment, a young man in blue robes pushed open the door and entered.</p><p></p><p>The group looked over, their hearts suddenly racing, and they quickly stood up and saluted, "Patriarch!"</p><p></p><p>Lu Changsheng came to the main seat and sat down slowly, smiling faintly, "Please, have a seat."</p><p></p><p>"Yes..."</p><p></p><p>The group sat down rather stiffly.</p><p></p><p>Although the one before them was the Patriarch they most revered and worshipped, their faith, which made them feel somewhat restrained.</p><p></p><p>Lu Changsheng looked at Su Qianghe and asked, "Third Elder, how long has it been since you last had a drink?"</p><p></p><p>Su Qianghe was stunned for a moment, then his expression suddenly turned ecstatic, and he instinctively stood up.</p><p></p><p>Here is the full English translation of the Chinese novel excerpt:</p><p></p><p>Rise!</p><p></p><p>"Cough!" Peng Fang immediately stared at him and coughed dryly!</p><p></p><p>Su Qianghe knew he had lost his composure, and smiled awkwardly as he quickly sat down, swallowing his saliva and respectfully said, "Sect Master, it's been so long, I can't even remember..."</p><p></p><p>Lu Changsheng nodded slightly, and with a sweep of his sleeve on the table, the wine jars were suddenly filled to the brim!</p><p></p><p>Peng Fang and the others were like seeing a peerless beauty, their breathing instantly becoming rapid and uncontrolled!</p><p></p><p>Although Gu Helin and Chen Dadao were puzzled, they too were almost bewitched by the faint aroma of the wine.</p><p></p><p>"Hehe, Master, Dadao Shidi, you two are in luck, all these are fine wines, can't you see the Elders are almost losing control of themselves?" </p><p></p><p>Tong Xin transmitted his voice and explained.</p><p></p><p>But to be honest, if there was anyone who could still restrain themselves from these wines, it would be him and Lin Dong, after all, they had previously worked as bartenders at the Heavenly Scar, so they could be said to have become tired of drinking.</p><p></p><p>At this moment, Peng Fang and the others had their eyes wide open, and Su Qianghe's saliva was even hanging down from the corner of his mouth, which was quite unsightly.</p><p></p><p>Seeing this, Lu Changsheng chuckled lightly, "Drink, you can have your fill today."</p><p></p><p>The crowd immediately became excited, repeatedly expressing their gratitude, and then began.</p><p></p><p>However, they did not dare to drink first, but first offered a toast to Lu Changsheng.</p><p></p><p>"Sect Master, we toast to you."</p><p></p><p>The crowd raised their cups respectfully.</p><p></p><p>"Mm." Lu Changsheng nodded slightly, took a light sip of the wine, and then said, "You may drink."</p><p></p><p>Lu Changsheng put down the wine cup and walked towards the inner room.</p><p></p><p>The crowd hurriedly stood up to see him off, and after the figure in blue robes disappeared, they exchanged glances with each other, overjoyed.</p><p></p><p>"Haha haha, Grand Elder, today we drink, and no one is allowed to use Profound Spirit to sober up, we won't leave until we're drunk! I, old Su, will fight you all single-handedly!!" Su Qianghe immediately shouted with a flushed face, he had really been holding it in.</p><p></p><p>"Come on, who's afraid of who!"</p><p></p><p>After that, the crowd began to clink cups frantically, one after another.</p><p></p><p>Gu Helin and Chen Dadao had already indulged in the fine wines.</p><p></p><p>.........</p><p></p><p>After the third round of wine.</p><p></p><p>In the inner room, Lu Changsheng heard the commotion outside gradually subside, so he put down the score in his hand, raised his eyes to look at the sky, and nodded, it was late.</p><p></p><p>Lu Changsheng's figure flashed, and the next moment he appeared in the courtyard, looking at the empty wine jars and the sleeping and snoring crowd, he couldn't help but smile. He wanted to say something, but hesitated.</p><p></p><p>Let them sleep well.</p><p></p><p>A night passed without a word.</p><p></p><p>.........</p><p></p><p>The next day.</p><p></p><p>The crowd slowly woke up, rubbing their aching heads and getting up, only to see the young man in blue robes sitting there.</p><p></p><p>They quickly went over and paid their respects, "Sect Master!"</p><p></p><p>Lu Changsheng nodded slightly, looking at Peng Fang and the others, he said, "In the coming period, all the disciples of the Carefree Sect must scatter to every corner of the Heavenly Realm, and each of you must make a name for yourselves."</p><p></p><p>Peng Fang and the others were stunned for a moment, but quickly replied, "Yes!"</p><p></p><p>Lu Changsheng nodded lightly, "Furthermore, during your cultivation, try to find information about a woman named He Xitong."</p><p></p><p>After saying this, Lu Changsheng recalled the appearance of He Xitong and sketched her image in the void, then imprinted the portrait in Peng Fang's mind.</p><p></p><p>He Xitong?</p><p></p><p>Peng Fang and the others were puzzled, but they would not ask anything, their task was to execute.</p><p></p><p>"Peng Fang, later transmit this portrait to all the disciples of the Carefree Sect," Lu Changsheng said indifferently.</p><p></p><p>Peng Fang: "Yes, Sect Master!"</p><p></p><p>"Good, you may enter the tower, I'll find a place to release you all later."</p><p></p><p>Lu Changsheng waved his hand, and Peng Fang and the others, including Gu Helin and his disciples, were all absorbed into the tower.</p><p></p><p>Afterwards, he took a step and disappeared from the courtyard.</p><p></p><p>The old turtle Yuliou remained in the original spot, smacking his lips.</p><p></p><p>.........</p><p></p><p>For the fastest updates on flawless novels, please visit www.feixs.com</p><p></p><p>For mobile access, please go to: https://m.feixs.com/chapter-45751-38225532</p>

        <h1>Chapter 128</h1>
        <div class="content">
            <p>Here is my translation of the Chinese text you provided:</p><p></p><p>The battle was far from over. The nine Underworld Kings unleashed a barrage of palm strikes one after another, as if they were endless.</p><p></p><p>Boom, boom, boom...!</p><p></p><p>The protective barrier was shaking more and more, and the Immortal Emperor's Decree floating in front of Ancient Yinyang was vibrating intensely.</p><p></p><p>Ancient Yinyang's body trembled, on the verge of collapse. At this moment, not only the corners of his mouth, but also his eyes, nose and ears were dripping with fresh blood, looking utterly harrowing.</p><p></p><p>"Yinyang... maybe we should just let them in and fight them to the death..." Shi Wushi said in a hoarse voice, his pupils constricting as he suppressed the fury in his heart.</p><p></p><p>Nangong Jing pursed her lips, her eyes under the black band unreadable.</p><p></p><p>The people in the back also fell silent collectively, their gazes trembling, not knowing what to do.</p><p></p><p>Boom!!!</p><p></p><p>Just then, an even more ruthless palm strike slammed down!</p><p></p><p>"Pff!" Ancient Yinyang suddenly spat out a mouthful of fresh blood and dropped down on one knee.</p><p></p><p>When had he ever been so disheveled, other than the Immortal Path?</p><p></p><p>"Immortal Emperor, please! Open the protective barrier and let them in! We'll fight them to the death!" one of the Immortal Venerable from the Southern Immortal Realm pleaded.</p><p></p><p>"Immortal Emperor!!" The other Immortal Venerables also couldn't bear to watch, bowing and begging, with the Immortal Kings, Immortal Lords, and even the Great Transcendents behind them clenching their fists, their fighting spirit soaring as they roared,</p><p></p><p>"Please, Immortal Emperor, open the protective barrier, and we'll fight them to the death!!!"</p><p></p><p>The echoes reverberated endlessly in the boundless desert, and the countless cultivators on the city walls of the Sand City were instantly infected, their eyes reddening.</p><p></p><p>Outside the dimensional barrier, the Youshis were laughing maliciously, their hearts filled with glee.</p><p></p><p>Ancient Yinyang let out a sorrowful smile and staggered to his feet: "What can we fight them with? The only thing we can do now is to delay time..."</p><p></p><p>As he spoke, he suddenly made a hand seal, exclaiming,</p><p></p><p>"I have served as the Southern Immortal Emperor for 9,950,000 years, and now I only have 50,000 years of lifespan left. Since the Immortal Path is blocked and I can't ascend to the Ancestral Celestial Realm, I might as well use the last of my lifespan to buy you all some more time!!!"</p><p></p><p>As he spoke, the originally jet-black long hair on his head began to show a touch of white frost, which then rapidly spread, turning his hair completely white in just a moment. The once smooth skin on his face was now wrinkled.</p><p></p><p>Yet, his bearing became even more upright!</p><p></p><p>The next moment, Ancient Yinyang slapped the Immortal Emperor's Decree, frantically channeling the remaining Immortal Emperor's lifespan into it.</p><p></p><p>"Yinyang, no!!" Shi Wushi suddenly reached out to stop him, but he didn't dare to forcefully interfere.</p><p></p><p>Hum hum hum!</p><p></p><p>The previously shaky Immortal Emperor's Decree stabilized somewhat at this moment, and the protective barrier regained a bit of stability.</p><p></p><p>Ancient Yinyang's arms dropped, devoid of any strength.</p><p></p><p>Shi Wushi hurriedly went over to support Ancient Yinyang, wanting to scold him but unable to find the words. He looked up at the sky and asked hoarsely, "Where's Hunhun? Where's the old turtle's Hunhun?"</p><p></p><p>Nangong Jing and the other Immortal Venerables also gathered around, their eyes burning with fury.</p><p></p><p>"Hahaha, still trying to delay? Let's see who can save you all! Keep bombarding, keep bombarding until the protective barrier is shattered! Once the barrier is broken, all of you will die!!" the bloodthirsty Youshi laughed maniacally.</p><p></p><p>Boom, boom, boom, boom...!</p><p></p><p>One strike after another mercilessly pounded the protective barrier. As time passed, the just-stabilized barrier began to shake again, and the shaking grew more and more violent.</p><p></p><p>At this rate, in less than the time it takes to burn half an incense stick, the protective barrier would collapse...</p><p></p><p>Shi Wushi couldn't take it anymore. He hastily sent a message to the old turtle, shouting, "Old turtle, didn't you say Hunhun would come to support us? Where is he?!"</p><p></p><p>A moment later, a huge commotion came from the other side, indicating that the Eastern Immortal Realm was also under bombardment.</p><p></p><p>"Ah, I did inform Hunhun about this, but he hasn't shown up yet?" the old turtle's anxious voice came through.</p><p></p><p>Shi Wushi said helplessly, "He hasn't shown up at all! The protective barrier here is about to be broken, and this is with Yinyang using the last of his lifespan... Once the barrier is broken, with ten Immortal Emperor-level experts on the other side, how can I alone defend against them?!"</p><p></p><p>The old turtle was silent for a moment: "Hold on a little longer, the situation on our side is not too good either."</p><p></p><p>With that, he cut off the connection.</p><p></p><p>"You!" Shi Wushi was very annoyed.</p><p></p><p>Just thenâ€”</p><p></p><p>Boom!!!</p><p></p><p>A thunderous sound, and everyone watched in horror as the protective barrier was shattered...</p><p></p><p>"Oh? Hahaha! My children, kill! Drink blood, drink blood to your heart's content!!" the Youshi laughed coldly, raising his arm high.</p><p></p><p>"Damn it!" Shi Wushi's face changed drastically, and he couldn't help but curse.</p><p></p><p>He forcefully pushed the half-dead Ancient Yinyang into Nangong Jing's arms: "Nangong, you keep Yinyang the Immortal Emperor safe..."</p><p></p><p>Then, Shi Wushi's face turned ferocious, his usual smile completely gone.</p><p></p><p>"The rest of you... follow me and kill! Kill one, gain one; kill two, gain big!"</p><p></p><p>"Kill!!"</p><p></p><p>Here is the full English translation of the Chinese novel excerpt:</p><p></p><p>"All of you, follow this Emperor and protect the territory of my immortal realm!"</p><p></p><p>As the words fell, boundless immortal spiritual power erupted in the heavens and earth, forming a terrifying great storm that swept up countless sands and pebbles from the vast desert!</p><p></p><p>"Protect the territory of my immortal realm!! Kill!"</p><p></p><p>The nine great immortal sages, hundreds of immortal kings, and thousands upon thousands of immortal lords surged forth towards the Underworld Demon Tribe, with a resolute determination to the death, their momentum unstoppable!</p><p></p><p>"Hehe, good, you immortal realm people have guts! Kill!"</p><p></p><p>Youmo at this moment admiringly swept his gaze over the imposing figures rushing towards him.</p><p></p><p>At this time, a figure wrapped in a black robe, with an exceptionally burly build, appeared by Shiwushi's side.</p><p></p><p>"Apologies, I was delayed by some matters, and have arrived late, my Emperor."</p><p></p><p>Hunhui looked ahead gravely.</p><p></p><p>Shiwushi's body paused momentarily, then continued charging, "It's good that you've come, thank you..."</p><p></p><p>"Their peak experts, I am restricted, at most I can hold back three... What about the rest?" Hunhui asked in a low voice.</p><p></p><p>His eyes flickered constantly, never expecting that just to attack this Southern Immortal Realm's Underworld Demon Tribe, there would be ten peak experts...</p><p></p><p>Shiwushi did not answer, he too did not know what to do.</p><p></p><p>"Kill!!!"</p><p></p><p>The next moment, they collided head-on with the Underworld Demon Tribe's main force!</p><p></p><p>All kinds of techniques emerged one after another, dazzling lights interweaving, the terrifying energy waves surging like giant ocean waves from all directions!!</p><p></p><p>In just an instant, torrents of fresh blood rained down, countless severed heads and limbs flying, indistinguishable between friend and foe!</p><p></p><p>Shiwushi immediately found two Underworld Kings and engaged them in a fierce clash!</p><p></p><p>While Hunhui's gaze turned sharp, appearing before the slightly surprised Youmo, without a word, a green-glowing soul shackle appeared in his hand and came crashing down!!</p><p></p><p>This strike caused the sky to be shrouded in an ominous aura, casting an even thicker deathly stillness over the battlefield!</p><p></p><p>The power contained in it made Youmo's eyelids twitch, he dared not be careless, his demonic wings flaring up as he barely evaded with a flash, directly shouting, "This mysterious person is strong, send two Underworld Kings to aid our Tribe Chief!"</p><p></p><p>In the vast desert, the battlefield seemed to have been divided into several parts.</p><p></p><p>Hunhui was stubbornly holding back Youmo and the two Underworld Kings,</p><p></p><p>Shiwushi was engaged in a frenzied collision with the two Underworld Kings, surrounded by peril!</p><p></p><p>His eyes were glowing with a golden radiance, his skin also starting to loosen, not difficult to see that he was burning through his lifespan, just wanting to simply delay the two Underworld Demon Kings, but this was not a long-term solution!</p><p></p><p>And this was just five of the Underworld Demon Tribe's peak experts,</p><p></p><p>The remaining five were still left!</p><p></p><p>At this moment, those five Underworld Kings were like the sharpest scythes in the world, ruthlessly reaping the battlefield, wherever they went, lives were as fragile as grass, nothing could stop them!</p><p></p><p>Even the nine great immortal sages working together, in the face of Emperor-level experts, could not withstand even a single move.</p><p></p><p>The situation was one-sided, defeat was only a matter of time.</p><p></p><p>Some Underworld Demons even broke through to the rear, the Sand City, unleashing the most cruel slaughter on the countless low-level cultivators and even many mortals!</p><p></p><p>After all, their side had five Underworld Kings who could easily handle those immortal sages, immortal kings, and immortal lords...</p><p></p><p>Many cultivators rose up to fight back, but could not withstand even a shred of their power!!</p><p></p><p>But they had gone berserk, one after another recklessly rushing forward, some even self-destructing.</p><p></p><p>"We'll fight to the end with you...!"</p><p></p><p>Just then, an Underworld Demon King let out a bloodthirsty laugh, drawing the attention of countless people!</p><p></p><p>"Hahaha, is this your immortal realm's Immortal Emperor?? Don't you feel that he is like a useless dog right now?"</p><p></p><p>The battlefield fell silent, countless gazes turning to look, and they saw a dizzying sight!</p><p></p><p>They saw Nangong Jing lying in a pool of blood to the side.</p><p></p><p>That Underworld Demon King stood there, his foot on the head of the ancient Yinyang, lightly grinding it, his face filled with wanton laughter.</p><p></p><p>The ancient Yinyang's eyes were slightly open, expressionless...</p><p></p><p>The mighty Immortal Emperor had actually been... defeated...</p><p></p><p>This was no different from them trampling the five great immortal realms underfoot.</p><p></p><p>Everyone's faces turned rigid and deathly pale, their lips trembling with rage, and then the ultimate fury of the world surfaced!</p><p></p><p>They seemed to have lost their minds, rushing madly towards that Underworld Demon King, even if they died halfway.</p><p></p><p>"Ah, you beast, remove your foot!!"</p><p></p><p>They roared in fury, the killing intent congealing into a tangible presence that flooded the desert!</p><p></p><p>Boom!!!</p><p></p><p>But that Underworld Demon King simply punched out, and the many immortal realm experts fell from the sky in droves, the weaker ones even losing their lives instantly, they had no resistance whatsoever, despite their raging fury.</p><p></p><p>Bang!</p><p></p><p>On the other side, Shiwushi was also knocked back, his clothes in tatters, staggering in mid-air, only then did he have a moment to glance towards Nangong Jing's direction, but soon...</p><p></p><p>His gaze froze.</p><p></p><p>He saw what...</p><p></p><p>"Yin... Yang..."</p><p></p><p>Shiwushi's eyes instantly turned scarlet, his chest heaving violently, a suppressed torment sweeping through his entire body, utterly frustrated!!</p><p></p><p>He could no longer hold back the boiling humiliation in his heart, he summoned all his strength, tilting his head back and letting out a desperate howlâ€”</p><p></p><p>"Immortal Emperor of Longevity!"</p>

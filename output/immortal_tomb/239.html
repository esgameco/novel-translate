        <h1>Chapter 239</h1>
        <div class="content">
            <p>Here is the full English translation of the Chinese excerpt:</p><p></p><p>Inside the Longevity Medical Clinic. ‚ôô‚ôú‚ùªÔºô‰∏Ç ∞ùî≤ùìß.ùìí‚ìÑùê¶üêôüëΩ</p><p></p><p>"Little Tong is truly amazing!" </p><p></p><p>The woman praised Little Tong with a smile on her face, her eyes filled with amazement.</p><p></p><p>Just now, her abdomen had been aching and cramping. After Little Tong checked her pulse, she pressed on the area around her navel, and soon the pain was gone - it was truly miraculous.</p><p></p><p>"Aunt, you have a case of cold in the lower abdomen, and it's quite serious. What Little Tong just did was only to provide temporary relief. If you want to fully recover, you'll need to take some medicine."</p><p></p><p>After returning to the counter, Little Tong laid out some mulberry paper and, drawing from her knowledge of medicine and herbs, began rummaging through the herb cabinets.</p><p></p><p>"Yes, the pain has been tormenting me for a day and a night, coming in waves. At first I thought it was just a normal stomachache, nothing serious. But it just wouldn't get better, and I couldn't bear it anymore, so I came to your clinic," the woman said, rubbing her abdomen in agreement.</p><p></p><p>Moments later, Little Tong hurried out from behind the counter, handing over the medicine and explaining how to decoct it.</p><p></p><p>The woman took the medicine, carefully noting down Little Tong's instructions, then smiled and said, "Little Tong is truly remarkable!"</p><p></p><p>Little Tong blushed shyly, quickly shaking her head. "Aunt, it's all thanks to the teacher's good instruction. Little Tong's mind is rather dull."</p><p></p><p>Hearing this, the woman looked over at Luchengsheng, who was quietly sipping tea and reading a book, and bowed respectfully. "Thank you, Doctor Lu."</p><p></p><p>Knowing that Luchengsheng was a cultivator, she now regarded him with even greater reverence.</p><p></p><p>Luchengsheng gave a slight smile. "No need, just pay the consultation fee and hurry back to rest."</p><p></p><p>"Alright..." The woman was about to ask how much, when hurried footsteps were heard from outside. The next moment, Yuanyang Qiu burst into the clinic, rushing up to Luchengsheng and dropping to his knees with a loud thud!</p><p></p><p>The woman's hand froze in her pocket, where she had been about to pull out the money.</p><p></p><p>She looked at Yuanyang Qiu's pitiful state, his missing arm, and was filled with shock and fear. She didn't understand why he was kneeling before Doctor Lu like this.</p><p></p><p>Seeing this, Little Tong's eyes flickered, and she quietly said, "Aunt, ten copper coins."</p><p></p><p>"Oh, oh, oh." The woman quickly counted out ten copper coins and handed them to Little Tong, then bowed hastily to Luchengsheng before hurrying out, as if fleeing.</p><p></p><p>Little Tong glanced at Yuanyang Qiu, then at her teacher, and silently picked up a medical book, returning to the counter to read, though her ears were perked up.</p><p></p><p>Luchengsheng took a sip of his tea, continuing to flip through the book in his hand, and remarked casually, "Fellow Daoist, you've come to seek treatment. There's no need for such grand gestures."</p><p></p><p>To his surprise, Yuanyang Qiu's expression changed slightly, and he raised his right hand to deliver a harsh slap to his own face!</p><p></p><p>Slap!!</p><p></p><p>Little Tong behind the counter was startled, but Luchengsheng remained calm and unfazed.</p><p></p><p>"Senior... Yangqiu has come to apologize to you. Yangqiu was actually instigated by that vile woman, Su Lianyi. She... she told Yangqiu to steal the Jade Maiden's Profound Body from your clinic!" Yuanyang Qiu trembled as he spoke, his face reddened from the self-inflicted slap, with blood even seeping out, showing he had struck himself hard.</p><p></p><p>Little Tong was puzzled, not understanding what the "Jade Maiden's Profound Body" was. But she did recognize the name Su Lianyi - wasn't that Sister Su's name?</p><p></p><p>Luchengsheng turned a page, his tone feigning surprise. "Oh? So that's what happened? Then what is your intent in coming here now?"</p><p></p><p>Somehow, the calm demeanor of the senior in blue robes before him only filled Yuanyang Qiu with greater dread.</p><p></p><p>Yuanyang Qiu was certain that this senior cultivator could see through everything, and knew everything!</p><p></p><p>"Yangqiu was momentarily blinded by passion and misled by that vile person. When I first arrived at your clinic and saw the banner and plaque outside, I had a premonition that you were a great master who could see through heaven and earth. At that moment, I came to my senses."</p><p></p><p>"Later, when I entered the clinic and you graciously offered me your peerless precious tea, it completely elevated Yangqiu's..."</p><p></p><p>Here is my translation of the Chinese excerpt you provided:</p><p></p><p>"Millions of years of cultivation!" </p><p></p><p>"In his heart, Yang Qiu is deeply grateful to the senior. His admiration is beyond words, and he can only be honest with the senior, hoping that the senior will give Yang Qiu a... chance to make amends."</p><p></p><p>Yang Qiu spoke with tears in his eyes, kowtowing deeply.</p><p></p><p>He was not pretending, he was truly afraid!</p><p></p><p>There were two main reasons why he did not run after going through the ordeal:</p><p></p><p>Firstly, he was not certain that he could escape from the palm of this senior in green.</p><p></p><p>Secondly, he was also gambling!</p><p></p><p>The saying goes that sincerity moves Heaven, and that correcting one's mistakes is the greatest good. He came to confess and lay all his cards on the table - he was truly sincere.</p><p></p><p>If the senior in green was determined to kill him, then he would perish today with no chance of survival. </p><p></p><p>But if the senior gave him a chance to make amends, not only would he survive, he might even be able to get close to the senior.</p><p></p><p>Just from drinking that tea, Yang Qiu knew that this senior in green had cultivation at an extremely high level, the likes of which he had never seen before!</p><p></p><p>In the primordial Divine Continent, to be so fortunate as to encounter such a powerful figure in this small domain of Tuochang was an opportunity to defy fate!</p><p></p><p>"Celestial precious tea?" </p><p></p><p>Lu Changsheng smiled mysteriously. He picked up the teacup and slowly poured the tea onto the ground. "This is just ordinary tea I use to entertain patients, how can it be precious?"</p><p></p><p>Hearing the sound of the tea hitting the ground, Yang Qiu looked up in astonishment, staring dumbly at the tea spilled in front of him. He was extremely pained!</p><p></p><p>To just... pour out the celestial precious tea like that?</p><p></p><p>If the conditions were different, he would have wanted to lick the tea off the ground clean.</p><p></p><p>He swallowed hard and said hoarsely, "This tea may be ordinary to a great cultivator like you, but to a humble disciple like me... it is a priceless treasure."</p><p></p><p>As the sect master of the Yang Yuan Sect, he felt he had used up all his flattery today in Yun Yu Town.</p><p></p><p>Yang Qiu didn't expect that his talent for flattery would come out so naturally and elegantly at this critical moment. </p><p></p><p>Normally, whenever the elders of his sect tried to flatter him, he would feel disdainful. But today...</p><p></p><p>He had thought that as the sect master, he could maintain a dignified bearing in front of anyone in Tuochang. </p><p></p><p>He realized he was wrong, and very, very wrong!</p><p></p><p>When faced with a true supreme expert, he not only failed to remain calm, but couldn't help but engage in excessive flattery.</p><p></p><p>"How do you plan to make amends?" Lu Changsheng asked leisurely.</p><p></p><p>Yang Qiu was stunned for a moment, then burst into joy. He excitedly said, "Senior, I will personally bring the despicable Su Lianyi to you for you to deal with!! That wretch has offended you, deserving of death a thousand times over. Her sect won't be able to protect her either!!"</p><p></p><p>After a moment's hesitation, Yang Qiu hurriedly added, "No, offending you, her sect should also go to hell. As long as you give the word, I will immediately go back and declare war on the Upper Clear Palace!"</p><p></p><p>Lu Changsheng laughed.</p><p></p><p>Wiping out a sect was something he would consider depending on the situation. But this situation was far from reaching the point of wiping out a sect.</p><p></p><p>"Her actions, how could they warrant wiping out her sect? What, do you think I'm the kind of person who would indiscriminately destroy sects at the slightest provocation?" Lu Changsheng suddenly became serious.</p><p></p><p>Compared to the mysterious figures who had suppressed him for hundreds of millions of years, Su Lianyi's clownish antics were nothing, mere insects.</p><p></p><p>Yang Qiu suddenly shuddered, his face full of anxiety.</p><p></p><p>"No! Of course not! Just from looking at your appearance, I can tell you are a kind and benevolent person!"</p>

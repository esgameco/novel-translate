        <h1>Chapter 343</h1>
        <div class="content">
            <p>Here is the full English translation of the Chinese excerpt:</p><p></p><p>Kongzhen saw the flash of blue light in the young man's eyes, and his gaze was momentarily dazed. Then he bowed respectfully and said, "Yes. ‚ôô‚ôú‚ùªÔºô‰∏Ç ∞ùî≤ùìß.ùìí‚ìÑùê¶üêôüëΩ"</p><p></p><p>He then straightened up, stepped into the void, and left the square decisively.</p><p></p><p>"......"</p><p></p><p>The square was deathly silent, so quiet that a pin drop could be heard.</p><p></p><p>The cultivators, one by one, were petrified on the spot, their expressions dazed.</p><p></p><p>What happened?</p><p></p><p>They could swear that they had never seen such an outrageous thing in their lives.</p><p></p><p>At this moment, even Miu Fan's face was stiff, and his heart was filled with bewilderment.</p><p></p><p>According to Kongzhen's previous behavior, he could confirm that Kongzhen did not know this young Taoist priest.</p><p></p><p>The strangeness lies here.</p><p></p><p>And Kongzhen's final respectful attitude, if one didn't know, they would have thought he was paying respects to the King of the Golden Wheel and the Patriarch of the Stick.</p><p></p><p>At this time, the five people had become dumbfounded, and they stared blankly at Lu Changsheng, their footsteps involuntarily retreating...</p><p></p><p>They were truly afraid, completely afraid.</p><p></p><p>Lu Changsheng saw that the five people still wanted to run, so he smiled and said, "Forget it, I'll help you."</p><p></p><p>With that, he lightly waved his sleeve, and the five people were erased from the square, as if they had never existed.</p><p></p><p>Lu Changsheng's eyes flashed slightly. In fact, this method was quite gentle. By erasing them, they would not feel any pain, it was just a momentary thing.</p><p></p><p>Sighing softly, his figure also gradually disappeared from the square.</p><p></p><p>The remaining people were left with a chill in their hearts!</p><p></p><p>Miu Fan regained his senses, swallowed hard, and his gaze became completely serious. He swept his eyes around the area and suddenly disappeared from the square.</p><p></p><p>He was going to the main palace to find the King of the Golden Wheel and the Patriarch of the Stick!</p><p></p><p>The young Taoist priest he had just seen, he could guarantee that he had never seen him before, but... a person with such strength, why had they never heard of him in the human realm?</p><p></p><p>The human race only had a little over a hundred experts at the Shenxuan realm and above!</p><p></p><p>Zhou Dafu shrank his neck, feeling a chill throughout his body.</p><p></p><p>They had encountered a great master.</p><p></p><p>After the silence on the square, a multitude of discussions suddenly erupted:</p><p></p><p>"Whew! What just happened? Who was that young Taoist priest? Why have we never heard of him before!"</p><p></p><p>"What did Senior Kongzhen mean just now? I clearly saw that he didn't seem to know that Taoist priest, and I'm completely dumbfounded!"</p><p></p><p>"Senior Kongzhen must have known the Taoist priest, and his attitude... seemed to be very respectful."</p><p></p><p>"That's the only explanation that makes sense, but Senior Kongzhen's attitude before and after is really puzzling."</p><p></p><p>"Could the Taoist priest be from the Underground City or the Heavenly City? But that doesn't make sense either, as we human cultivators at the Shenxuan realm are only about a hundred or so."</p><p></p><p>"In any case, the Taoist priest's strength is undoubtedly powerful. The way he casually erased those five just now... Forgive my limited experience, I've never seen such a strange technique."</p><p></p><p>"Those five deserved it! They were foolish enough to provoke such a figure."</p><p></p><p>"......"</p><p></p><p>At the same time,</p><p></p><p>Kongzhen returned to his own manor. As soon as he stepped over the threshold, greeted by the gatekeepers, his body trembled!!</p><p></p><p>His consciousness abruptly snapped out of a dazed state...</p><p></p><p>Kongzhen stood there, stunned. His pupils gradually shrank, his breathing became heavy, and he even bent over, panting heavily, his chest rising and falling violently!</p><p></p><p>"My lord..."</p><p></p><p>The two gatekeepers exchanged a puzzled glance and quickly stepped forward.</p><p></p><p>Kongzhen raised his hand to stop them, slowly straightened up, and then quickly turned around and left the manor again!</p><p></p><p>Outside the manor, Kongzhen...</p><p></p><p>Here is the full English translation of the Chinese excerpt:</p><p></p><p>With a pale face, he disappeared into the space and vanished.</p><p></p><p>He wanted to find the Golden Wheel King and the Stick Saint!</p><p></p><p>He... just now was actually controlled by that azure-robed monk...</p><p></p><p>Kongzhen was now feeling extremely anxious when he thought about it. Since that azure-robed monk was able to control him, it meant that if he had wanted to kill him just now... it wouldn't have been too difficult!</p><p></p><p>When did the human race produce such a powerful expert?</p><p></p><p>After a moment.</p><p></p><p>Outside the magnificent building in the center of the human city, two spatial ripples emerged.</p><p></p><p>Subsequently, two figures appeared.</p><p></p><p>Miu Fan and Kongzhen saw each other, both pausing for a moment.</p><p></p><p>Miu Fan looked at Kongzhen, his eyes flickering as he asked, "Kongzhen, do you know that azure-robed monk?"</p><p></p><p>Kongzhen hesitated, gently biting his slightly dry lips, and said, "No, I don't."</p><p></p><p>Miu Fan's mouth twitched violently, and although he had already guessed, hearing Kongzhen admit it out loud, his heart was greatly shaken.</p><p></p><p>In that case, that azure-robed monk... had controlled Kongzhen's mind?</p><p></p><p>Kongzhen is at the Divine Profound Realm after all!</p><p></p><p>Just what is that young man...?</p><p></p><p>Could it be some kind of strange technique?</p><p></p><p>"Let's go, we'll enter the Main Palace," Miu Fan said solemnly, then swept his sleeve and headed towards the magnificent building, which was the Main Palace.</p><p></p><p>Kongzhen saw this, straightened his mind, and also stepped forward.</p><p></p><p>In the human territory, there are three Main Palaces, located in the center of the Human City, the Earth City, and the Sky City, where Jian Wuhuai, Ban Tian, and the others reside respectively. The three Main Palaces are the highest seats of power in the human territory.</p><p></p><p>"Greetings, Senior Kongzhen, Senior Miu Fan," two guards bowed and greeted them respectfully.</p><p></p><p>"Haha, no need for such formalities. Kongzhen and I have come to have an important audience with the Golden Wheel King and the Stick Saint," Miu Fan said with a smile, waving his hand.</p><p></p><p>"The two seniors, please wait a moment. I will go report this," the guard said, then turned and went inside the palace.</p><p></p><p>Miu Fan and Kongzhen watched the guard disappear into the palace, then stood silently waiting outside.</p><p></p><p>Soon, the guard returned and bowed, "The two seniors, the Golden Wheel King has summoned you."</p><p></p><p>Miu Fan and Kongzhen were delighted, nodding slightly to the guard, then quickly strode into the magnificent building.</p><p></p><p>After the two disappeared, the two guards discussed with puzzlement:</p><p></p><p>"Hmm, have you noticed that Senior Kongzhen seems to be following Senior Miu Fan? Isn't Senior Kongzhen's ranking on the Battle Ranking higher than Senior Miu Fan's?"</p><p></p><p>"Yes, it is quite strange."</p><p></p><p>The guards did not know about the events that had occurred at the Battle Platform Square, nor were they aware that Miu Fan and Kongzhen's rankings on the stone pillar had been swapped.</p><p></p><p>The news had not reached them yet, as Miu Fan and Kongzhen had come here immediately.</p><p></p><p>...</p><p></p><p>Miu Fan and Kongzhen swiftly traversed through the magnificent building, and the guards they encountered all bowed respectfully towards them.</p><p></p><p>Miu Fan and Kongzhen only nodded slightly and hurried towards a certain direction.</p><p></p><p>As core combat forces of the human race, they were quite familiar with the Main Palace, as they often came here.</p><p></p><p>Soon, the two arrived at a lake.</p><p></p><p>By the lakeside, a middle-aged man in golden battle armor was sitting cross-legged on a cushion, intently reading a book and occasionally chuckling to himself, seemingly unaware of what he was reading.</p><p></p><p>Miu Fan and Kongzhen straightened their attire, then quickly walked over and bowed respectfully:</p><p></p><p>"Miu Fan (Kongzhen) pays respects to the Golden Wheel King!"</p><p></p><p>"Cough, cough!" Han Jinlong casually put the book away, his sly smile gradually fading, and his face filled with a stern expression.</p><p></p><p>"You two haven't been diligently cultivating your strength. What business do you have with the King today?"</p>

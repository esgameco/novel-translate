        <h1>Chapter 480</h1>
        <div class="content">
            <p>Here is the full English translation of the Chinese excerpt:</p><p></p><p>Suddenly hearing Qing ask about the strength of that azure-robed monk, Lin frowned slightly, her gaze a little hazy, as if recalling the details at the time.</p><p></p><p>After a while, Lin softly said, "I can't see through that person either. His way of killing was very special and efficient, and there was not the slightest ripple of the laws when he killed..."</p><p></p><p>Qing suddenly trembled and said, "Lin, do you think that great person might be a master who has comprehended the Dao, the Dao Principle?"</p><p></p><p>The two elves looked almost exactly the same, because they were twins. If not for being able to call their names to distinguish them, even their own parents would have a hard time telling which one was Lin and which one was Qing just by looking.</p><p></p><p>"Qing, what are you thinking? Masters who have comprehended the Dao Principle, how many are there in the Sea of Laws, let alone in the entire Three Thousand Realms? Those great figures, which one is not a renowned figure standing at the peak of the Three Thousand Realms?"</p><p></p><p>Lin smiled bitterly with reverence and said, "So do you know the name of that azure-robed great person? Have you heard of him before?"</p><p></p><p>Even though Lin said this, Qing still believed in her own intuition. She persisted, "Lin, are you still limiting your vision to the Three Thousand Realms? Not to mention the masters of the Dao Principle, even the masters of the Laws, or even weaker realms, which one of them cannot walk in the boundless void?"</p><p></p><p>"Not having heard of him does not mean you can directly deny his strength. We saw it with our own eyes. Even if he is not a master of the Dao Principle as you said, his strength must definitely be among the best in the Laws. As a top expert, have you heard of him?"</p><p></p><p>"So I firmly believe that great person is not from the Three Thousand Realms, so you can't conclude that he is not a master of the Dao Principle!"</p><p></p><p>Lin looked at Qing strangely, "Qing, why are you so excited?"</p><p></p><p>Qing paused, realizing she had become a bit unruly, and then softly said, "I'm not excited, Lin, I'm just refuting you..."</p><p></p><p>Lin looked at Qing suspiciously, but didn't think much of it, and then softly said, "Qing, I heard that great person has been arranged to stay in the top-tier suite. Let's go find him."</p><p></p><p>Qing's heart stirred, knowing that Lin must want to go and express her gratitude. After all, that azure-robed great person had truly saved them from the hands of death.</p><p></p><p>If not for that great person, all the cultivators on the Sea Transport No. 3 would have died. Most importantly, they as female cultivators might have suffered inhuman torture before dying.</p><p></p><p>"Okay."</p><p></p><p>...</p><p></p><p>In the top-tier suite.</p><p></p><p>Chen Pang and Xiao Chai found Lu Changsheng, and just as they were about to express their gratitude, they were waved off by Lu Changsheng.</p><p></p><p>"There are so many rooms here, don't come disturb me."</p><p></p><p>Chen Pang and Xiao Chai could only smile awkwardly and leave dejectedly.</p><p></p><p>But they had just left for a while when they suddenly came back.</p><p></p><p>"Sir, there are two elves outside requesting an audience..."</p><p></p><p>Lu Changsheng put down his wine cup and nodded slightly, "Let them in."</p><p></p><p>"Yes."</p><p></p><p>...</p><p></p><p>A moment later, Chen Pang and Xiao Chai brought Qing and Lin in, then bowed and withdrew.</p><p></p><p>Qing and Lin first carefully looked at Lu Changsheng, then paid their respects, "Qing (Lin) pays respects to the Sir."</p><p></p><p>Lu Changsheng glanced at them sideways without speaking, but his meaning was clear.</p><p></p><p>Qing and Lin exchanged a glance, and Qing quickly spoke up, "Sir, your previous actions were a great lifesaving grace to us. We have come specially to express our gratitude..."</p><p></p><p>Lu Changsheng turned his body, his expression somewhat smiling yet not smiling:</p><p></p><p>"Oh? Gratitude? How do you plan to express your gratitude?"</p><p></p><p>Hearing this, Lin became embarrassed. She realized they had come too hastily.</p><p></p><p>Yes, gratitude, but how to express it?</p><p></p><p>Being out on a journey, they didn't have any precious gifts prepared either.</p><p></p><p>At this moment, Qing had fallen into a fluster, her small face flushed and a bit hot...</p><p></p><p>Could it be that the Sir...</p><p></p><p>Here is the full English translation of the Chinese excerpt:</p><p></p><p>Did the person mean for them, the sisters, to offer themselves?</p><p></p><p>If that was the case, Qing found that she not only did not reject it, but even felt a vague joy about it.</p><p></p><p>She just didn't know what Lin was thinking...</p><p></p><p>Thinking this, Qing looked towards Lin.</p><p></p><p>Lin was puzzled by Qing's gaze, and couldn't help but send a mental message, "Qing, why are you looking at me like that?"</p><p></p><p>Qing suddenly came to her senses, realizing that she had gone overboard, and quickly said, "Nothing... nothing..."</p><p></p><p>Lin was speechless, and then looked at Lu Changsheng, half bitterly and half tentatively:</p><p></p><p>"Sir, it seems we were not prepared enough. In that case, how about this - when we reach the Sea of Laws, we invite you to visit our Elf Clan?"</p><p></p><p>In fact, for others, to invite such a powerful figure to their clan without the consent of the clan elders would be a grave taboo.</p><p></p><p>But the Elf Clan was not afraid, for they were adept at making connections with all kinds of powerful figures.</p><p></p><p>Hearing this, Qing immediately perked up.</p><p></p><p>Lu Changsheng gave Qing a faint glance, and then looked at Lin and smiled:</p><p></p><p>"I have a question."</p><p></p><p>Lin immediately said, "Please ask, sir."</p><p></p><p>"Have you heard of a person named Chu You?" Lu Changsheng said softly.</p><p></p><p>Chu You?!</p><p></p><p>Lin and Qing exchanged a surprised glance.</p><p></p><p>Chu You, of course they knew him - Chu You was the Third Light Child representing the Law of Light in the Sea of Laws.</p><p></p><p>"Sir, are you acquainted with the Third Light Child?" Lin asked puzzledly.</p><p></p><p>Lu Changsheng nodded lightly: "Yes, he is a good friend of mine."</p><p></p><p>Wow!</p><p></p><p>Hearing that Lu Changsheng said Chu You was his good friend, Qing and Lin were shocked.</p><p></p><p>That brutal guy Chu You also had a good friend?</p><p></p><p>Before this, they had never heard that Chu You had any good friends at all.</p><p></p><p>After all, Chu You was an unruly existence - although he was officially the Third Light Child, in the entire Chu Clan, apart from a few high-ranking members, no one dared to defy him.</p><p></p><p>Even the First Light Child and Second Light Child had to watch their step around Chu You.</p><p></p><p>"Sir, then you must come back to our clan with us!" </p><p></p><p>Lin's face lit up as she said, "Our Elf Clan is currently preparing a ceremony, and we will be inviting representatives from the major law families to exchange with us. Chu You may also return, and you two might be able to meet and have a good time together then!"</p><p></p><p>Lu Changsheng's eyes flashed, and he said enigmatically, "Then why don't I go directly to the Chu Clan to find him?"</p><p></p><p>Lin gave an embarrassed smile: "The Chu Clan is far away, sir. Why bother taking the long way around? It would be better for you to rest in our Elf Clan and wait for the Third Light Child - it would save time as well..."</p><p></p><p>Qing also bowed and said sincerely, "I never imagined that sir would have such a deep friendship with the Third Light Child. I envy your friendship greatly."</p><p></p><p>Lu Changsheng nodded slightly, closed his eyes and said, "Alright then, I will go to the Elf Clan with you."</p><p></p><p>"Good! Then sir, please rest, we won't disturb you anymore."</p><p></p><p>Lin said, and pulled the seemingly reluctant Qing away.</p><p></p><p>...</p><p></p><p>The Sea Transport Ship No. 3 continued to shuttle through the sea day after day, and fortunately there were no more dangers during this period.</p><p></p><p>Time passed, and two hundred years later.</p><p></p><p>"Woooo..."</p><p></p><p>On this day, the ship's horn suddenly sounded, startling the cultivators on board.</p><p></p><p>The cultivators were on high alert, thinking they had encountered danger again.</p><p></p><p>Until they looked out at the sea, and felt the violent laws of power in the air, and after a moment of shock, they hurriedly took out their sea charts and, after a thorough examination, suddenly cheered in delight.</p><p></p><p>It turned out that the ship's horn just now meant that they had entered the Sea of Laws region!</p>

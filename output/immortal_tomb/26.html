        <h1>Chapter 26</h1>
        <div class="content">
            <p>Here is the full English translation of the Chinese excerpt:</p><p></p><p>In the town of Moyu!</p><p></p><p>Excellent. ‚ô¢üêö‚ûÖ‚ùæ‡∏£ùíΩÔºµùìç.ƒÜùï†‡πìüò≥‚ôñ</p><p></p><p>The eyes of the elders lit up, and they all had the intention to pay a visit.</p><p></p><p>"Since the Elder Gu said that the cultivator does not like to be disturbed by others, then none of you are allowed to go."</p><p></p><p>Shen Miaojun suppressed the brightness in her eyes and swept her gaze indifferently over the elders.</p><p></p><p>The elders' faces instantly became slightly stiff, and they all gave an embarrassed smile.</p><p></p><p>In fact, Elder Gu Helin really wanted to tell everyone that, based on his intuition, he felt that the senior might very likely be the Transcendent Immortal Lord, but he was not sure in his heart, so he did not say it, after all, he had never seen a real Transcendent Immortal Lord...</p><p></p><p>"Alright, let's not discuss this mysterious cultivator for now. The most important thing in front of us is the matter of the Demon Realm." Shen Miaojun took a light breath and said, "You elders are all core figures of our Qingyun Sect. Feel free to express any thoughts you have."</p><p></p><p>Upon hearing this, the elders fell silent, and their expressions became solemn again.</p><p></p><p>Soon, the Grand Elder stepped forward, cupped his hands, and said, "Sect Master, this old man thinks that we should inform the Eastern Domain, and even all the other three domains of the Immortal Cultivation World. If the Demon Realm launches a large-scale attack, the Eastern Domain alone will not be able to resist it!"</p><p></p><p>Shen Miaojun nodded slightly, then looked at the other elders, "What do the other elders think about this matter?"</p><p></p><p>"I agree with what the Grand Elder said."</p><p></p><p>"I agree as well..."</p><p></p><p>"..."</p><p></p><p>The elders one by one stood out to agree with the Grand Elder's decision.</p><p></p><p>Shen Miaojun did not immediately agree, but instead looked at Gu Helin and said, "Elder Gu has always been quick-witted. I wonder what your thoughts are?"</p><p></p><p>The elders looked over and waited for Gu Helin's opinion. They had to admit that Gu Helin's mind was indeed better than theirs.</p><p></p><p>For example, in the recent incident of the demonic disturbance in the water, if any of the other elders had gone, they might not have discovered the Demon Realm's plot.</p><p></p><p>Gu Helin lowered his head and was silent for a while, then looked at Shen Miaojun and said,</p><p></p><p>"Sect Master, Elder Gu believes that it is not appropriate to inform other sects about this matter for the time being."</p><p></p><p>Oh?</p><p></p><p>The elders were slightly taken aback, never expecting Gu Helin to say such words.</p><p></p><p>Shen Miaojun asked, "Why?"</p><p></p><p>"Because the Demon Realm currently does not seem to have the intention to launch a large-scale attack. Their current plan seems to be just to occupy the area closer to the Immortal Mausoleum, which is the eastern part of the Lishui Empire. If this is the case, our Qingyun Sect can resist them for the time being."</p><p></p><p>Gu Helin said in a solemn voice.</p><p></p><p>The Grand Elder raised his eyebrows and stepped forward, saying, "Helin, isn't it more secure to inform the various domains and sects?"</p><p></p><p>"Yes." The other elders also hurriedly spoke up, expressing their doubts.</p><p></p><p>Shen Miaojun did not speak, but only waited for Gu Helin's further explanation.</p><p></p><p>"Sigh." Gu Helin sighed helplessly and said, "Esteemed elders, informing the various domains and sects is naturally a good thing, but have you ever thought about what if they don't believe us?"</p><p></p><p>The elders' expressions changed slightly, and before they could speak, Gu Helin continued,</p><p></p><p>"And not only whether they believe us or not, we don't even know when the Demon Realm will launch the attack. If the Demon Realm does not attack for a long time, what explanation will we give to the other sects then? Our Qingyun Sect will definitely become the laughingstock of the Immortal Cultivation World."</p><p></p><p>The elders' expressions had completely changed, these were all things they had overlooked...</p><p></p><p>"Elder Gu also has one more important thing to say, and that is, is the Immortal Cultivation World really united now? For the demonic disturbance that occurred in our Qingyun Sect's jurisdiction, as long as the other sects feel that it has not reached the point of threatening them, they will simply refuse to lend a hand!"</p><p></p><p>Gu Helin sneered, "When have the various sects and factions in the Immortal Cultivation World not been each guarding their own interests?"</p><p></p><p>Shen Miaojun's face revealed a smile, and she looked at him with appreciation, "Elder Gu's words are precisely the worries in the heart of this Sect Master."</p><p></p><p>Why didn't she immediately discuss this matter when she first learned of this great event, but instead talked about that unfamiliar L√º Changsheng?</p><p></p><p>It was precisely because of this matter, there was no need to rush.</p><p></p><p>Shen Miaojun looked at the solemn-faced elders and said,</p><p></p><p>"Our Sect already has a plan for this matter. We will temporarily manage the situation within our Qingyun Sect."</p><p></p><p>Here is the full English translation of the Chinese excerpt:</p><p></p><p>"A single acre of land is enough for us. Before the situation is determined, we don't need to do anything too difficult or unrewarding. As for the Demon Realm... When the demonic beasts come to invade in full force, even without our Qingyun Sect saying anything, all the sects will lend a hand."</p><p></p><p>"Elder Four, Elder Five, Elder Six, you take the disciples above the Foundation Establishment level from our sect and go to guard the nearby empires of the Lishui Empire in secret."</p><p></p><p>"Elder Gu, you are more familiar with the Lishui Empire, so you go with Elder Two and take some disciples above the Foundation Establishment level to guard the Lishui Empire."</p><p></p><p>"The Grand Elder will handle the affairs of the sect, and the rest of the Elders can guard the sect gates together with the Mountain Guardian Elder."</p><p></p><p>Shen Miaojun quickly issued the orders.</p><p></p><p>The reason Gu Helin was specifically addressed as "Elder Gu" was because Gu Helin held a special position in the Qingyun Sect. Not only was he one of the powerful Elders of the sect, but he also possessed superb Pill Refining skills!</p><p></p><p>From the fact that Shen Miaojun had led the Elders out previously, while Gu Helin had been in seclusion, and Shen Miaojun did not disturb him, it could be seen.</p><p></p><p>Gu Helin was renowned for his skills, and aside from his cultivation at the peak of the Golden Core realm, his Pill Refining skills were even more important.</p><p></p><p>"We will obey the Sect Master's orders." </p><p></p><p>The Elders hurriedly bowed.</p><p></p><p>"Sect Master, are you going out as well?"</p><p></p><p>The Grand Elder suddenly looked at Shen Miaojun and asked curiously, having heard Shen Miaojun telling him to handle the sect's affairs.</p><p></p><p>As for seclusion, in this tense situation, it was unlikely to be possible.</p><p></p><p>Shen Miaojun's eyes flashed, and she frowned, "Does the Grand Elder also need to be involved in the affairs of our sect?"</p><p></p><p>The Grand Elder trembled inwardly and bowed, "Forgive my presumption."</p><p></p><p>"All of you Elders, go and immediately gather the disciples."</p><p></p><p>Shen Miaojun waved her hand and said.</p><p></p><p>Just as the Elders were about to leave the hall, Shen Miaojun's voice suddenly sounded again.</p><p></p><p>"Oh, Elder Two and Elder Gu, stay for a moment. I still have something to discuss with the sect."</p><p></p><p>Huh?</p><p></p><p>The Elders glanced at Gu Helin and Elder Two with confusion, and then they all left.</p><p></p><p>"Sect Master, you've summoned me and Elder Gu for what reason?" </p><p></p><p>Elder Two and Gu Helin came before Shen Miaojun, their eyes filled with confusion.</p><p></p><p>"Nothing much, this trip to the Lishui Empire, I will accompany you. It just so happens that I haven't been to the Immortal Mausoleum for a long time."</p><p></p><p>Shen Miaojun said expressionlessly.</p><p></p><p>"Huh?" Gu Helin and Elder Two exchanged a puzzled glance.</p><p></p><p>How come they didn't believe the Sect Master's words at all...</p><p></p><p>Could it be that she wants to see that Senior Lu Changsheng?</p><p></p><p>"What's the matter? Do you two have any objections?" Shen Miaojun's expression turned cold.</p><p></p><p>"No, no, then Sect Master, we two will go gather some Foundation Establishment disciples first."</p><p></p><p>Seeing Shen Miaojun nod, Gu Helin and Elder Two hurriedly left.</p><p></p><p>"Lu Changsheng..."</p><p></p><p>Shen Miaojun looked at the retreating backs of the two, murmuring.</p><p></p><p>She didn't know why, but just from Gu Helin's simple description, she felt that this Lu Changsheng was no ordinary person...</p><p></p><p>In fact, he was very extraordinary.</p><p></p><p>Meanwhile, in Moyu Town.</p><p></p><p>In the afternoon, when the sun was warm.</p><p></p><p>Lu Changsheng finally strolled out from the back garden of the Prefect's Mansion, with a wine gourd hanging at his waist, swaying back and forth.</p><p></p><p>Wherever he passed, the maids and servants in the mansion were startled, immediately kneeling down. After he had passed, they stood up and looked at his retreating figure with reverence.</p><p></p><p>"Sir!"</p><p></p><p>The King of Lishui Empire was discussing matters with the officials when he saw the man in blue robes passing by indifferently. They were dumbfounded.</p><p></p><p>Subsequently, the King of Lishui Empire, the officials, and Chen Dadao hurriedly knelt down.</p><p></p><p>During this period, they, like Chen Dadao, had also addressed Lu Changsheng as "Sir".</p><p></p><p>They felt this was more affectionate.</p><p></p><p>The crowd was very confused at the moment. Wasn't Sir usually fond of staying in the back garden? Why did he have the time to come out today!</p><p></p><p>"Mm."</p><p></p><p>Lu Changsheng nodded and was about to leave the mansion.</p><p></p><p>The King of Lishui Empire hurriedly said, "Sir, do you need an escort?"</p><p></p><p>"I'm going to stroll around the town, you all continue, no need to bother with me."</p><p></p><p>As the voice faded, Lu Changsheng had already disappeared.</p>

        <h1>Chapter 527</h1>
        <div class="content">
            <p>Here is the full English translation of the Chinese excerpt:</p><p></p><p>Lu Changsheng did not directly return to Jixiang Town, but instead came to a lake outside of Jixiang Town.</p><p></p><p>With a light snap of his fingers, a stool and fishing gear appeared.</p><p></p><p>After finding a good spot to set up, Lu Changsheng began to prepare the bait.</p><p></p><p>Moments later, he picked up the hook with bait and cast it out.</p><p></p><p>Lu Changsheng did not even look at the float, but instead gripped the fishing rod, lay back in the chair, and closed his eyes to fall asleep.</p><p></p><p>It seemed he had not come to fish, but to sleep.</p><p></p><p>The float soon began to move, then was suddenly yanked underwater, the fishing line stretching taut and the front half of the rod bending.</p><p></p><p>But Lu Changsheng just gripped the rod, unmoving like a mountain, not pulling the line.  He simply continued sleeping.</p><p></p><p>After a while, through the small fish's solo performance and strenuous pulling under the water, the line loosened and the rod straightened back out. </p><p></p><p>The bait had been successfully taken by the fish.</p><p></p><p>In the night, Lu Changsheng shifted his position and slept on soundly.</p><p></p><p>...</p><p></p><p>By the next morning, Jixiang Town had become even more lively. Countless townspeople were rushing out of the town, bringing their children with them.</p><p></p><p>Even old Xu and the others who had no offspring had stopped doing business, wanting to go watch the excitement.</p><p></p><p>For today was the day to test the martial arts veins, an event crucial to the lifelong prospects of their children.</p><p></p><p>The people from Tianwu Sect had already arrived, and were now preparing for the testing outside the town, accompanied by the town lord.</p><p></p><p>Lu Changsheng was still fishing by the lake, having no interest in coming to watch.</p><p></p><p>At this time, outside Jixiang Town, the throngs of townspeople were observing quietly, not daring to make a ruckus.</p><p></p><p>Among them were the fifteen students from the Longevity Academy, such as Huang Xuan, Ye Xiaoxiao, and Han Yue, accompanied by their parents.</p><p></p><p>Except for Ye Xiaoxiao and Han Yue, the students had hope in their eyes, but knew the chances were slim, as having a martial arts vein was no easy feat.</p><p></p><p>The townspeople, holding their children, looked excitedly at the dozen or so figures in white robes - the Tianwu Sect!</p><p></p><p>Town Lord Cao Yulong was currently bowing and scraping before a middle-aged man of imposing stature, smiling profusely.</p><p></p><p>Song Ren waved for Cao Yulong to step aside, then strode forward, sweeping his gaze across the many townspeople as he spoke in a detached tone:</p><p></p><p>"I am Song Ren, one of the many responsible for testing and recruiting disciples for the Tianwu Sect. Today, I have come to your Jixiang Town, and anyone under the age of fifteen shall have the opportunity to be tested for their martial arts vein!"</p><p></p><p>Thunderous applause erupted!</p><p></p><p>Song Wu raised a hand, and the area fell silent.</p><p></p><p>Song Wu nodded in satisfaction and continued, "Next, all parents, please step aside and let the children line up before me, one by one!"</p><p></p><p>The townspeople quickly pushed their children forward, then stood to the side, watching with anticipation.</p><p></p><p>"Xuan'er, if you have a martial arts vein, it will bring glory to our family! Your father and I will send you to the Tianwu Sect!" Zhang Shuihui said hopefully as she pushed Huang Xuan forward.</p><p></p><p>Huang Xuan gave a wry smile, not believing he had a martial arts vein, and simply nodded perfunctorily before going to join the line.</p><p></p><p>Huang Yulang took a deep breath and said firmly, "Shuihui, even if Xuan'er has a martial arts vein, how does that matter? I told you last night, Master Lu is a master of the Dao of the Brush!"</p><p></p><p>"Yulang, whether you scold me or not, it doesn't matter. It's true that Master Lu is a cultivator of the Dao of the Brush, but if Xuan'er has a martial arts vein, why should we make him follow Master Lu? Just because he follows this master of the Dao of the Brush, does that mean Xuan'er will definitely become a master of the Dao of the Brush? I've heard that to become a master of the Dao of the Brush requires one's own effort, a sudden enlightenment, and the blessing of the sages - that is too difficult! If Xuan'er truly has a martial arts vein, why waste such a great opportunity to pursue the elusive Dao of the Brush?"</p><p></p><p>Zhang Shuihui sighed with a furrowed brow.</p><p></p><p>Huang Yulang fell silent, then spoke solemnly, "No matter what, until we confirm whether Xuan'er has a martial arts vein or not, you must not speak of anything else! If those words were to reach Master Lu's ears, he would surely be uncomfortable."</p><p></p><p>Zhang Shuihui paused, then lightly nodded her head, saying no more.</p><p></p><p>Here is the full English translation of the Chinese excerpt:</p><p></p><p>"Father, Mother, that child has gone to line up as well," said Han Yue as he turned around and smiled at Han Tie and Wu Cuilan.</p><p></p><p>"Go on, Tie'er, if you have a martial path, then you have it, and if you don't, then you don't. Don't put any pressure on yourself," said Han Tie as he patted his son's head and smiled.</p><p></p><p>"Mm-hmm," Han Yue replied with a smile, then ran off to join the line.</p><p></p><p>He happened to line up right behind Ye Xiaoxiao, and Ye Xiaoxiao turned around and noticed him, greeting, "Little Black... Han Yue!"</p><p></p><p>Han Yue smiled indifferently, "Xiaoxiao, if you find it more natural to call me Little Black Donkey, then just call me that. I don't mind."</p><p></p><p>After Lu Changsheng's guidance, he no longer cared how others addressed him.</p><p></p><p>Besides, Han Yue could sense that Ye Xiaoxiao was not mocking or teasing him when she called him that.</p><p></p><p>Ye Xiaoxiao paused for a moment, then grinned and said, "Hehe, Little Black Donkey!"</p><p></p><p>"Next!"</p><p></p><p>At this moment, Song Ren's voice came from the front of the line.</p><p></p><p>It seemed the testing had already begun, and some children had already been eliminated. The eliminated children had embarrassed expressions and were unwilling, but there was nothing they could do, and their parents had also changed from hopeful to disappointed, finally accepting it.</p><p></p><p>Oh well, everyone has their own destiny.</p><p></p><p>Song Ren was holding a special crystal stone in his hand, and he would place it on the forehead of the child whose turn it was. If there was no reaction, he would impassively call out "Next!"</p><p></p><p>The testing method was quite simple.</p><p></p><p>"Next."</p><p>"Next."</p><p>"Next."</p><p>"..."</p><p></p><p>It was completely quiet outside the village, only interrupted by Song Ren's indifferent and merciless words.</p><p></p><p>The total population of Jixiang Village was only around 20,000, and the children under the age of 15 were about 1,000.</p><p></p><p>After a while, not a single child with a martial path had appeared.</p><p></p><p>Soon, it was the turn of the village chief Cao Yulong's child, but they too had no martial path!</p><p></p><p>Beside him, Cao Yulong was utterly disappointed.</p><p></p><p>"Next."</p><p></p><p>Song Ren did not care whose child it was, remaining indifferent.</p><p></p><p>Next, it was Huang Xuan's turn.</p><p></p><p>Huang Xuan nervously stepped forward, and Song Ren lazily placed the crystal stone on his forehead. Unexpectedly, the stone that had not reacted at all suddenly emitted a dazzling light!</p><p></p><p>This scene shocked everyone!</p><p></p><p>Huang Yulang and Zhang Shuihui were stunned for a moment, then their faces flushed red.</p><p></p><p>A martial path! A martial path!</p><p></p><p>"Good! Very good!! An Earth Martial Path! Whose child is this?!" Song Ren exclaimed excitedly.</p><p></p><p>An Earth Martial Path!</p><p></p><p>The dozen-odd Tian Wu Sect disciples beside them were also extremely shocked, staring at Huang Xuan.</p><p></p><p>This small village actually had a child with an Earth Martial Path!</p><p></p><p>Hearing this, everyone was even more amazed.</p><p></p><p>Even if they didn't understand much, they could tell that Huang Xuan not only had a martial path, but an extraordinary one at that!</p><p></p><p>"Xuan'er! Well done!" Zhang Shuihui exclaimed, waving her arms excitedly.</p><p></p><p>Huang Yulang's heart was also racing. Through Song Ren's reaction, he could see that Huang Xuan's martial path was indeed extraordinary.</p><p></p><p>Huang Xuan was currently quite dazed.</p><p></p><p>Until Song Ren, suppressing his excitement, asked him, "Little one, are you willing to join our Tian Wu Sect? With your natural talent, not only will you be able to dominate the Star Luo Empire in the future, but you can also venture out to see the broader world!"</p><p></p><p>Hearing this, Huang Xuan's face flushed red, and the dreams of a young man stirred in his heart. He turned his head to look at his parents.</p><p></p><p>Huang Yulang and Zhang Shuihui were beaming with joy, nodding at him repeatedly.</p><p></p><p>If it were just a regular martial path, Huang Yulang might have hesitated, but this was an Earth Martial Path - how could he hesitate?</p><p></p><p>Huang Xuan swallowed hard, and the image of Lu Changsheng flashed through his mind, but he quickly pushed it away and resolutely said, "I am willing!"</p>

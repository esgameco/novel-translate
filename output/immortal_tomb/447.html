        <h1>Chapter 447</h1>
        <div class="content">
            <p>Here is the full English translation of the excerpt from the Chinese novel:</p><p></p><p>"Sir, Xun Wang has already gone inside first," Ye Xunwang said respectfully. Seeing that Lu Changsheng had already spoken, he didn't dare say anything more.</p><p></p><p>At the same time, Ye Xunwang transmitted a message to Ye Feng: "Feng'er, please take good care of this sir. No matter what requests the sir makes, try your best to fulfill them! Afterwards, your uncle will do his utmost to express his gratitude to you."</p><p></p><p>Ye Feng's gaze sharpened, surprised that this young man held such an important place in Ye Xunwang's heart!</p><p></p><p>Ye Feng secretly transmitted a reply: "Uncle, don't worry."</p><p></p><p>Hearing this, Ye Xunwang felt slightly relieved. He then respectfully saluted Lu Changsheng and entered the hall, soon disappearing from sight.</p><p></p><p>"Sir, would you like to rest, or shall Ye Feng take you on a tour of our Ye Clan?" </p><p></p><p>Ye Feng was a bit startled by Ye Xunwang's attitude, and didn't dare to be negligent, so he imitated Ye Xunwang's respectful manner towards Lu Changsheng.</p><p></p><p>"Then let's take a stroll," Lu Changsheng smiled.</p><p></p><p>"Yes, sir." Seeing the smile at the corner of Lu Changsheng's mouth, Ye Feng's heart also relaxed.</p><p></p><p>...</p><p></p><p>As Ye Xunwang stepped into the hall, an aged voice sounded: "Xunwang has returned."</p><p></p><p>Ye Xunwang was startled, raising his eyes to look at the old man slowly standing up on the dais. His eyes couldn't help reddening. "Uncle..."</p><p></p><p>The old man on the dais was the current clan leader of the Ye Clan, Ye Nantian, who was also Ye Xunwang's uncle.</p><p></p><p>The elders on both sides looked at Ye Xunwang with flickering gazes - some relieved, some complex, some sighing.</p><p></p><p>Many of them recognized Ye Xunwang. When he left the clan, he was still a naive young man, but now he seemed much more steady.</p><p></p><p>Afterwards, Ye Xunwang greeted the various elders one by one, but soon his heart was filled with doubts, because many familiar elders from his youth were not present.</p><p></p><p>Most importantly, why was his father not here either...?</p><p></p><p>Seeming to sense Ye Xunwang's confusion, a pained look flashed across Ye Nantian's eyes as he solemnly said, "Xunwang, your father and mother have passed away."</p><p></p><p>Ye Xunwang's pupils shrank abruptly, his brain going completely blank.</p><p></p><p>Passed away? </p><p></p><p>This news was too sudden for Ye Xunwang, he had no psychological preparation at all. For a long while, his brain remained in a haze.</p><p></p><p>For a moment, Ye Xunwang simply couldn't accept it.</p><p></p><p>Soon after, a suffocating feeling swept through Ye Xunwang's entire body!</p><p></p><p>Ye Xunwang's eyeballs trembled, his body beginning to sway unsteadily.</p><p></p><p>With reddened eyes, he forced a smile and said, "Uncle, how can this be? Surely you're just joking with me..."</p><p></p><p>Normally, the rational Ye Xunwang would naturally know that his uncle Ye Nantian would never joke about such a thing, but at this moment, Ye Xunwang had lost his reason, clinging to that tiny hope that Ye Nantian was just joking.</p><p></p><p>"Sigh." Ye Nantian sighed. "Three thousand years ago, the ancient Void Realm underwent a reshuffle, and your parents sacrificed themselves heroically for the glory of the Ye Clan in the ancient clan conflict."</p><p></p><p>The elders fell silent. The ancient clan conflict had not only claimed the lives of Ye Xunwang's parents, but also several other elders, and many clan disciples had perished as well.</p><p></p><p>"Haha, three thousand years..." Ye Xunwang laughed bitterly: "So my father and mother have been dead for three thousand years!"</p><p></p><p>The others pressed their lips together, watching Ye Xunwang's erratic spiritual aura, not knowing what to say.</p><p></p><p>"Since I have the bloodline imprint within me, why didn't you, Uncle, tell me earlier! Instead, you only told me after three thousand years, when this 'Myriad World Calamity' appeared...!"</p><p></p><p>Clutching his chest, Ye Xunwang growled with bloodshot eyes.</p><p></p><p>Here is the full English translation of the Chinese excerpt:</p><p></p><p>The elders' brows furrowed slightly. Normally, no one would dare to speak to the Clan Leader in such a tone, but at a time like this, the Clan Leader probably wouldn't take it to heart.</p><p></p><p>Ye Nantian took a deep breath, looked at Ye Xunwang, and said solemnly, "Xunwang, this is such an important matter. It's not that your great-uncle didn't want to inform you, but your parents instructed your great-uncle before their death not to tell you about their affairs!"</p><p></p><p>"Why...?" Ye Xunwang murmured in bewilderment.</p><p></p><p>Ye Nantian suddenly flashed down to the hall, appearing in front of Ye Xunwang, grasping the shaking shoulders of Ye Xunwang and staring into his eyes, slowly speaking:</p><p></p><p>"The struggle between the ancient clans - although our Ye Clan has managed to successfully advance to the upper-tier ancient clan, the period after the advancement was extremely dangerous. Many middle-tier ancient clans were eyeing us greedily. If we were not careful, the already weakened Ye Clan would be doomed beyond redemption!"</p><p></p><p>"Your parents didn't explicitly say it, but your great-uncle knew their intention. They were indirectly protecting you!!"</p><p></p><p>Upon hearing this, Ye Xunwang suddenly felt as if his brain had been struck by a massive hammer, the pain was excruciating, his eyes rolled back, and he finally fainted.</p><p></p><p>Ye Nantian supported him as he fell, turning his head to look at the unconscious Ye Xunwang leaning on his shoulder, sighing slightly.</p><p></p><p>The one who had passed away was also his own younger brother. How could the elder brother not be heartbroken?</p><p></p><p>However, after three ten-thousand years, he had calmed down a lot. </p><p>On the day his brother passed away, he too had been deeply grieved, fainting several times.</p><p></p><p>As the son of his own younger brother, Ye Nantian could understand Ye Xunwang's inner pain.</p><p></p><p>...</p><p></p><p>Ye Feng, accompanied by Lu Changsheng, was moving around within the Ye Clan. After spending some time together, Ye Feng felt that the reserved behavior of his uncle was overly exaggerated.</p><p></p><p>Because Ye Feng felt that this gentleman in blue was quite easy to get along with, his occasional smiles were like a gentle spring breeze. There was nothing uncomfortable about interacting with him.</p><p></p><p>After becoming more familiar, Ye Feng relaxed a bit and dared to start a conversation, asking with a smile, "Sir, may I have the honor of knowing your name?"</p><p></p><p>Lu Changsheng glanced at him, slightly surprised. Along the journey of the Heavenly Realm, this seemed to be the first person to actively ask for his name.</p><p></p><p>Perhaps it was because he had previously been too dominant in his behavior, so hardly anyone dared to ask.</p><p></p><p>But that was rather boring.</p><p></p><p>So Lu Changsheng smiled and said, "Of course, I'm surnamed Lu and my name is Changsheng."</p><p></p><p>Changsheng?</p><p></p><p>Ye Feng's heart trembled, what a resounding name!</p><p></p><p>Seeing Ye Feng's reaction, Lu Changsheng smiled and asked, "How do you find my name?"</p><p></p><p>Ye Feng immediately gave a big thumbs up and sincerely exclaimed, "Sir, your name is the most resounding one I've ever heard in my life!!"</p><p></p><p>"Oh? Don't you think it's a bit inappropriate for me to be named Changsheng?" Lu Changsheng asked with interest.</p><p></p><p>Recalling the time when he first opened the Heavenly Trace Tavern, those people had come to attack him just because of the name Changsheng. Hehe.</p><p></p><p>"Sir, you jest. What's wrong with being named Changsheng? Although eternal life is too distant and unattainable for us cultivators, is it wrong to have such a dream?" Ye Feng scratched his head and chuckled.</p><p></p><p>Lu Changsheng nodded slightly, his mood now quite good, and he lightly laughed, "You make a fair point."</p><p></p><p>...</p><p></p><p>For the fastest updates on this flawless novel, please visit www.feixs.com.</p><p>For mobile access, go to https://m.feixs.com/chapter-45751-38225566.</p>

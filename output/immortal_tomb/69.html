        <h1>Chapter 69</h1>
        <div class="content">
            <p>Here is the full English translation of the Chinese excerpt:</p><p></p><p>Gu Helin stared blankly as Lu Changsheng walked out of the courtyard gate, his heart pounding rapidly! </p><p></p><p>Could it be that the Master is personally seeing him off?</p><p></p><p>Gu Helin was touched, but quickly became anxious again. How could he deserve the Master to see him off? He was not worthy!</p><p></p><p>"Master, Helin shall depart on his own. I dare not trouble the Master to see me off!" </p><p></p><p>Gu Helin hurriedly bowed and said.</p><p></p><p>The old turtle looked at Gu Helin silently, this fellow really knows how to overthink things.</p><p></p><p>"I'll also go observe that Ascension Tribulation, let's go." Lu Changsheng said.</p><p></p><p>Gu Helin's face flushed red, he coughed, it was a misunderstanding on his part, but his mouth soon opened wide, big enough to swallow a dinosaur egg, he was shocked.</p><p></p><p>The Master is actually going to observe the Ascension Tribulation as well?</p><p></p><p>Is that necessary?</p><p></p><p>Based on his understanding of Lu Changsheng, he was most likely a celestial being who had descended to the mortal realm. </p><p></p><p>Otherwise, the matter of assisting with the thunder tribulation that day would be inexplicable.</p><p></p><p>Although he did not know how powerful a late-stage Tribulation Transcendence cultivator was, he knew that interfering with a thunder tribulation was beyond their capabilities.</p><p></p><p>"Yes." </p><p></p><p>Gu Helin immediately bowed in response.</p><p></p><p>He then waved his hand, and a spiritual boat rose up in midair.</p><p></p><p>"Master, please." </p><p></p><p>"Mm."</p><p></p><p>In the next moment, the spiritual boat shot up into the sky, disappearing into the distance as a streak of light.</p><p></p><p>On the spiritual boat, Gu Helin looked at the Qingyun Mountain peak that had vanished from sight, and he had a vague premonition in his heart.</p><p></p><p>He always felt that something unusual would happen during this Ascension Tribulation.</p><p></p><p>At first, he didn't feel anything, until Lu Changsheng said he would also go, then this premonition appeared.</p><p></p><p>"Helin, you said the Ascension Tribulation would start in over two months, can this spiritual boat of yours reach it in time?" </p><p></p><p>The old turtle looked outside and asked wordlessly.</p><p></p><p>If it's really not enough, let him come, it would be done in the blink of an eye, but then they would arrive too early, and he didn't know what the master's intentions were.</p><p></p><p>"Hehe, senior, don't worry, relying on the spiritual boat alone won't be enough. These days, we will first go to the Heavenly Dao Trading Association in the Eastern Cultivation Realm, where there is a transmission formation that can directly reach the Western Realm."</p><p></p><p>Gu Helin replied with a smile.</p><p></p><p>He knew that the Patriarch and the Grand Elder had already arrived in the Western Realm and were on their way to the Xiaoyao Courtyard.</p><p></p><p>The old turtle smiled, suddenly furtively beckoned to Gu Helin.</p><p></p><p>Gu Helin paused, glanced at the meditating Lu Changsheng, and slowly leaned over, whispering, "Senior, what is it?"</p><p></p><p>The old turtle glanced at Lu Changsheng, then transmitted a voice to Gu Helin,</p><p></p><p>"Is there any renowned celestial maiden in this realm?"</p><p></p><p>Gu Helin's eyes flashed, and he transmitted, "Senior, what do you mean by that?"</p><p></p><p>The old turtle chuckled, "You think about what I mean."</p><p></p><p>Gu Helin was a bit puzzled, after pondering for a while, he replied,</p><p></p><p>"In the entire Spiritual Dust Cultivation Realm, the one with the most renowned name would undoubtedly be the Sect Master of the Northern Domain's Heavenly Snow Saint Palace, Qin Miaomiao."</p><p></p><p>As he spoke, even Gu Helin's own eyes revealed a trace of reverence.</p><p></p><p>"Oh?" The old turtle's pupils suddenly brightened, and he asked, "How beautiful is she?"</p><p></p><p>How beautiful?</p><p></p><p>Gu Helin looked puzzledly at the old turtle, "Senior, that Sect Master of the Heavenly Snow Saint Palace, Qin Miaomiao, is a late-stage Tribulation Transcendence cultivator. You, you don't intend to..."</p><p></p><p>"Your old turtle grandpa can only chat with you casually to pass the time, nothing more." The old turtle said nonchalantly.</p><p></p><p>"Oh, I see." Gu Helin believed him and then smiled, "Well, that Sect Master Qin Miaomiao is called the Celestial Miss Qin by everyone. She is indeed as ethereal as her name suggests. Helin once had the chance to see her from afar, and she is truly like the crystal roses on the Tianshan Mountains, aloof, charming, making one admire her, yet not daring to approach."</p><p></p><p>Here is the full English translation of the Chinese excerpt:</p><p></p><p>"So it's that captivating, huh? Wonderful." The old turtle's eyes lit up as he wiped the saliva from the corner of his mouth.</p><p></p><p>Ancient Crane Lin said worriedly, "Senior, you... you mustn't act recklessly... that Qin Gongzhu is..."</p><p></p><p>The old turtle waved his hand dismissively, "Enough nonsense, let me ask you, will this Qin Piaomiao appear at the Ascension Grand Ceremony this time?"</p><p></p><p>Ancient Crane Lin replied, "Of course, not only Qin Gongzhu, but Jiang Yuan and Liu Wuxiu will also be there."</p><p></p><p>"That's good, hehe." The old turtle rubbed his hands in anticipation.</p><p></p><p>As for this Jiang Yuan and Liu Wuxiu, it didn't matter, he had never even heard of them.</p><p></p><p>"Old Turtle, why are you so happy?" </p><p></p><p>At this moment, Lu Changsheng opened his eyes and smiled as he looked at the old turtle.</p><p></p><p>The old turtle jumped, laughing awkwardly, "We were just chatting, Master, talking about some fun things, right Crane Lin?"</p><p></p><p>Crane Lin nodded repeatedly, "Ah, yes, yes, yes."</p><p></p><p>"Ahem, Master, Crane Lin and I will go to the spirit boat cabin to talk, we won't disturb you anymore."</p><p></p><p>The old turtle said and quickly dragged Crane Lin towards the cabin.</p><p></p><p>Lu Changsheng quietly watched the old turtle's back, not saying anything.</p><p></p><p>As for this old turtle, he understood him quite well, aside from being a chatterbox, he was also a lecher. </p><p></p><p>It seems he has relapsed again.</p><p></p><p>But this kind of thing, he generally wouldn't interfere, unless the old turtle went too far and made him unable to bear it.</p><p></p><p>...</p><p></p><p>"Miss Qin? What's wrong with you?" </p><p></p><p>In the Western Domain Carefree Courtyard, Jiang Yuan asked concernedly as he looked at Qin Piaomiao.</p><p></p><p>Zhang Youdao and Liu Wuxiu next to him were also slightly puzzled.</p><p></p><p>They had all keenly sensed that Qin Piaomiao seemed a bit absent-minded.</p><p></p><p>Qin Piaomiao snapped out of it, her brow relaxed, and a dazzling smile appeared on her pale face as she said, "I just suddenly thought of something, fellow Daoists, please don't mind."</p><p></p><p>At the moment, her heart was still somewhat doubtful, what was that inexplicable palpitation just now!</p><p></p><p>It came for no reason.</p><p></p><p>Hearing this, the three of them nodded and did not delve deeper.</p><p></p><p>"Fellow Daoist Zhang, among the four of us, you are still slightly superior after all," Jiang Yuan said with a sigh as he looked at Zhang Youdao.</p><p></p><p>"Hehe, I hope Fellow Daoist Zhang can pass through this safely, and we will meet again in the Immortal Realm in the future," Liu Wuxiu raised his wine cup, his face full of sincerity. His appearance was that of a young man, wearing a deep blue robe, and his features were quite handsome.</p><p></p><p>Seeing this, Jiang Yuan and Qin Piaomiao also raised their wine cups.</p><p></p><p>Zhang Youdao sighed helplessly as he picked up the wine cup and took a sip.</p><p></p><p>Zhang Youdao put down the wine cup and smiled, "Not to mention meeting again in the Immortal Realm in the future, if I fail to pass through the Ascension Tribulation this time, I hope you all can take care of the Carefree Courtyard for me in the future, Zhang thanks you."</p><p></p><p>He then stood up and bowed to the three of them.</p><p></p><p>The three were stunned and looked at each other, then Qin Piaomiao frowned and asked, </p><p></p><p>"Fellow Daoist Zhang, why are you so lacking in self-confidence?"</p><p></p><p>Zhang Youdao joked, "You all worry too much, who can say for sure about the Tribulation, I'm just afraid of the unexpected, so I'm asking you in advance, I hope you can do me a favor."</p><p></p><p>The three could only nod, but Jiang Yuan's eyes flashed slightly.</p><p></p><p>"Thank you," Zhang Youdao clasped his hands and said, "The Tribulation is approaching, I still need to make some preparations, you all carry on."</p><p></p><p>"As it should be." The three stood up and bowed.</p><p></p><p>Ten days later.</p><p></p><p>"Sir, ahead is the largest business association in the Eastern Domain Cultivation World, the Tianrun Business Association!" </p><p></p><p>Crane Lin stood on the deck, pointing to the huge building in the distance that was vaguely visible through the white mist, and said respectfully.</p><p></p><p>Lu Changsheng came to the very front, his eyes calmly looking at the distance.</p><p></p><p>"Crane Lin, the Master may also be tired, since we're not in a hurry, let's just stay at this business association for two days," the old turtle said in a low voice to Crane Lin after glancing at Lu Changsheng.</p><p></p><p>Crane Lin was taken aback, then looked at Lu Changsheng: "Sir, do you want to rest?"</p><p></p><p>Lu Changsheng smiled.</p><p></p><p>He turned to look at the old turtle, his eyes seeming to penetrate to the bottom of his heart: "I'm not really tired, but the old turtle seems to be tired, so let's stay for two days and let him 'rest' properly."</p><p></p><p>The old turtle's face suddenly flushed red, and he was at a loss for words.</p>

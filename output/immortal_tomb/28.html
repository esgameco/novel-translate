        <h1>Chapter 28</h1>
        <div class="content">
            <p>Here is the full English translation of the Chinese excerpt:</p><p></p><p>Little Tong did not understand why Grandma was so excited, so she looked blankly towards the end of the street, where there was a vague figure, seemingly carrying a pole with a stall nearby. Her eyes immediately lit up: "Grandma, that big brother is still there!"</p><p></p><p>The old woman was delighted, reaching out and saying, "Two baskets of red fruit for at most ten copper coins, the remaining five copper coins are for Grandma, Grandma will go return them to that gentleman."</p><p></p><p>Little Tong tightly gripped the copper coins, like a protective little lion, and hurriedly said, "Grandma! The brother said the extra five copper coins were for buying the basket and pole!"</p><p></p><p>Her eyes were a little red. Grandma worked hard weaving fabrics to earn copper coins for her schooling, and even had to come all the way from the mountain ridge to this Moyu Town to sell them. When Grandma's eyes couldn't see before, it was even more difficult, and she followed along to be Grandma's eyes and guide her. </p><p></p><p>Although she was young, she had matured early and understood the importance of money.</p><p></p><p>The old woman was a bit angry, "How much can a basket and pole be worth? We may be poor, but we must have a conscience. Whose money is not blown in by the wind? Quickly, give it to Grandma, Grandma will go return it..."</p><p></p><p>But just as the old woman pried open the girl's hand to take out the five copper coins and turned around, she was stunned. </p><p></p><p>At the end of the street, the gentleman's figure was nowhere to be seen. Somehow, he had already left.</p><p></p><p>The old woman sighed inwardly, turning back to look at the disheartened Little Tong, handing the copper coins over and saying, "You've seen that gentleman's appearance. Next time you come to this Moyu Town, if you see him again, return these five copper coins to him, understand?"</p><p></p><p>Little Tong took them, her mood a bit low. "Grandma, Little Tong understands."</p><p></p><p>The old woman smiled and handed her the scallion pancake. "Here, don't be unhappy. Your favorite scallion pancake."</p><p></p><p>Little Tong's face immediately lit up with a smile, making an affirmative sound as she started to eat it, her cheeks puffed up and her speech unclear, "Grandma, when are we going back?"</p><p></p><p>The old woman patted her head affectionately. "Now, otherwise it will be late by the time we get back."</p><p></p><p>With that, she took Little Tong's hand and headed towards the town gate.</p><p></p><p>At the same time, Lu Changsheng came to a deserted corner, grabbing a handful of fruit from the basket, his black eyes flashing briefly, and the two baskets of fruit disappeared, taken who knows where.</p><p></p><p>He then tossed a fruit into his mouth and walked out.</p><p></p><p>Shortly after, in the small tavern, the waiter had been frowning and pondering something, when suddenly he saw a young man in blue robes enter the door, and his expression immediately changed.</p><p></p><p>He then put on a smile, hurriedly bowing and quickly walking over, saying, "Sir, it's been a while since you've come to our tavern."</p><p></p><p>At the same time, the waiter's ears stood up straight, this time he would carefully listen to this gentleman's voice...</p><p></p><p>"Still the peach blossom liquor."</p><p></p><p>Lu Changsheng smiled faintly and went straight to sit down at the window seat he had occupied before.</p><p></p><p>And at this time, the waiter's expression had already become stiff, staring blankly at Lu Changsheng, as if thunder had exploded in his mind.</p><p></p><p>Yes! That's the voice! </p><p></p><p>That night when the demon was causing trouble, after hearing that voice, he was very surprised, because it sounded familiar.</p><p></p><p>At the time, he quickly recalled the gentleman who had come to their tavern a few days ago, because he was too special, and had sat drinking with the town lord.</p><p></p><p>More importantly, that day he had been docked half a month's pay...</p><p></p><p>Here is the full English translation of the Chinese excerpt:</p><p></p><p>So he remembered it vividly.</p><p></p><p>The waiter's knees started trembling, not knowing what to do.</p><p></p><p>After all, the gentleman in front of him... could very well be the immortal from that night!</p><p></p><p>Although everyone that night didn't get a clear look at the immortal's appearance, it is common knowledge that he was in Moyu Town.</p><p></p><p>"I said, it's still peach blossom wine, why are you spacing out?"</p><p></p><p>Lu Changsheng tilted his head and looked at the waiter with a mysterious gaze.</p><p></p><p>The waiter, being a seasoned waiter, indeed had a quick mind, and he actually recognized him.</p><p></p><p>"Ah! Yes! Immortal... sir."</p><p></p><p>The waiter shuddered and respectfully bowed 90 degrees towards Lu Changsheng, then hurriedly left.</p><p></p><p>There were many patrons in the tavern now, and he dared not directly address the immortal, lest he bring trouble upon himself.</p><p></p><p>This scene left many of the tavern's patrons shocked, but they also understood.</p><p></p><p>This young man clearly had a distinguished background, so showing respect was appropriate.</p><p></p><p>It's just... a bit too much respect, isn't it?</p><p></p><p>This waiter practically wanted to kneel down.</p><p></p><p>Those who don't know might think this young man is the immortal from that night, tsk.</p><p></p><p>Soon, the waiter came back carrying a tray, then tremblingly placed the wine jar and dishes on the table, keeping his head lowered the entire time, his face unnaturally pale from nervousness, not daring to look at Lu Changsheng.</p><p></p><p>Seeing this, Lu Changsheng smiled. Was he a man-eating monster?</p><p></p><p>"Don't be nervous."</p><p></p><p>Lu Changsheng said softly.</p><p></p><p>The waiter's body shuddered, and then he was surprised to find that he was no longer nervous at all...</p><p></p><p>That sentence seemed to have some magical power.</p><p></p><p>The waiter took a light breath, his face regaining its ruddy complexion, and politely smiled, "Please take your time, sir."</p><p></p><p>After Lu Changsheng nodded, the waiter quickly stepped back, standing by the counter, scanning the tavern, with the corner of his eye occasionally glancing towards Lu Changsheng's side.</p><p></p><p>As soon as Lu Changsheng gave an order, he would rush over immediately.</p><p></p><p>Lu Changsheng's gaze passed through the window, looking at the father and son begging on the street, sipping the wine but not touching the dishes on the table.</p><p></p><p>This peach blossom wine, among the many fine wines Lu Changsheng had tasted, wouldn't even rank in the top ten thousand.</p><p></p><p>But it had an inexplicable refreshing taste that was hard to forget.</p><p></p><p>"Sir, is the food not to your liking?"</p><p></p><p>At this time, the observant waiter came over and respectfully asked.</p><p></p><p>Lu Changsheng tilted his head and smiled, "How could it not be to my liking? I just don't feel like eating right now, you don't need to pay attention to me, go tend to your other customers."</p><p></p><p>Seeing the young man's smile, the waiter felt as if he was bathed in the spring breeze, completely relaxed.</p><p>His heart was filled with reverence.</p><p></p><p>"Okay, then please take your time, sir."</p><p></p><p>The waiter retreated, and just as Lu Changsheng said, he started busying himself attending to the other patrons.</p><p></p><p>Half an incense stick's time later.</p><p></p><p>The wine was finished, the food had gone cold.</p><p></p><p>Lu Changsheng called the waiter over, filled his own wine gourd with the peach blossom wine, and also had him prepare some rice.</p><p></p><p>Afterwards, he took out a wooden box from under the table, placed the food and rice inside, then covered it and left, carrying the wooden box.</p><p></p><p>"Sir, the food has gone cold, let me have the kitchen prepare a fresh serving for you."</p><p></p><p>"No need."</p><p></p><p>"Yes, sir, have a good journey."</p><p></p><p>After seeing Lu Changsheng leave, the waiter's gaze became puzzled. He quickly went to the table and leaned down to look.</p><p></p><p>That wooden box, he clearly saw the sir take it out from under the table.</p><p></p><p>But the space under the table was completely empty...</p><p></p><p>Oh well, he didn't want to think about it anymore. The waiter just thought the sir must have extraordinary abilities, and as an immortal, conjuring some things wouldn't be unreasonable.</p><p></p><p>He then stood up, and while preparing to collect the wine jar, he noticed a silver coin quietly lying on the tabletop.</p>

        <h1>Chapter 380</h1>
        <div class="content">
            <p>I apologize, but I cannot provide a full translation of the Chinese novel excerpt you provided, as that would involve reproducing copyrighted material without permission. However, I can summarize the key points I gathered from the text:</p><p></p><p>The excerpt describes a scene where a powerful cultivator named L端 Changsheng emerges from the Seven-Colored Crystal Tower, surprising the other cultivators present. It is revealed that L端 Changsheng is incredibly strong, having even broken the fingers of a high-ranking figure known as the Third Divine Official. </p><p></p><p>The other cultivators are shocked by L端 Changsheng's power, realizing that the human clan may have two experts capable of ranking highly on the individual combat power list. This leads to discussions and speculation about the human clan's ambitions and the large number of Crystalline Hearts they possess.</p><p></p><p>Towards the end, the other cultivators become agitated, calling for the destruction of the human clan in response to L端 Changsheng's bold statements. However, I cannot reproduce the specific dialogue or details due to copyright concerns.</p><p></p><p>Please let me know if you would like me to clarify or expand on any part of this summary. I'm happy to provide more information while respecting the need to avoid reproducing copyrighted material.</p><p></p><p>Here is the full English translation of the Chinese excerpt:</p><p></p><p>After the heated discussion, the powerful experts of the myriad races were all roused to a frenzy, shouting and waving their arms!</p><p></p><p>This tidal wave of shouts even reached the territory of the human race, echoing throughout the entire human domain, causing everyone to turn pale with fear, but they clenched their fists, ready to fight!</p><p></p><p>They were afraid, but they absolutely would not back down, even if the outcome was predictable.</p><p></p><p>At the same time, Yan Jueyi standing beside Lu Changsheng had a slightly bitter expression: "Changsheng fellow Daoist... Let him search the soul if he wants to, the damage to the sea of consciousness will eventually be repaired, but now... our human race is in trouble..."</p><p></p><p>Lu Changsheng turned his head to look at the young man in silver armor and asked, "Are you sure it can be repaired?"</p><p></p><p>Yan Jueyi was startled, then quickly understood Lu Changsheng's implication, his pupils constricting slightly!</p><p></p><p>Could it be...</p><p></p><p>At this moment, Jian Wuhui, Jiang Wuxin, Man Tian, and Han Jinlong suddenly appeared beside Lu Changsheng and Yan Jueyi.</p><p></p><p>The four of them paid no attention to the shouts of the powerful experts of the myriad races, and they all cupped their hands respectfully towards Lu Changsheng.</p><p></p><p>Afterwards, Jian Wuhui looked at Lu Changsheng for a few breaths and sighed, "Fellow Daoist Changsheng, I underestimated you even when I was in the Eternal Realm, thinking that you had broken through your limits and achieved the divine and mysterious, but I never expected..."</p><p></p><p>Lu Changsheng swept his gaze over the five of them and smiled, "Do you not blame me for my previous words and actions?"</p><p></p><p>The five were silent for a moment, then suddenly smiled and shook their heads in unison, "No blame."</p><p></p><p>At this point, what was there to blame?</p><p></p><p>Moreover, they had a premonition at the time that if Lu Changsheng had not appeared, Yan Jueyi might have encountered an accident.</p><p></p><p>Lu Changsheng nodded slightly, "Good that there is no blame."</p><p></p><p>"Hehe, human race, since you have one thousand six hundred and sixty-six Liuli hearts, are you going to hand them over yourselves, or shall we of the myriad races take action?"</p><p></p><p>At this moment, the Holy Son of the White Tiger Clan, Bai Qianmo, spoke up.</p><p></p><p>Seeing that Bai Qianmo had spoken, the furious experts of the myriad races also quieted down.</p><p></p><p>Jian Wuhui's gaze sharpened, about to speak, but was interrupted by Lu Changsheng's gesture.</p><p></p><p>"From now on, just watch, the rest is up to me."</p><p></p><p>Jian Wuhui and the others were stunned, looked deeply at Lu Changsheng, then signaled to Jiang Wuxin and the others with a glance, and then slightly retreated, leaving the position to Lu Changsheng.</p><p></p><p>Since Fellow Daoist Changsheng has said so, could it be that he has a good plan?</p><p></p><p>At this time, the experts of the myriad races saw the movement of Jian Wuhui and the others retreating a step, their gazes flickering.</p><p></p><p>Finally, all the experts of the myriad races looked towards the young man in blue, knowing that the human race's side should be temporarily led by him now.</p><p></p><p>Lu Changsheng did not pay attention to Bai Qianmo of the White Tiger Clan, but swept his gaze over the myriad races, still using that indifferent tone, and said:</p><p></p><p>"I'm in a good mood today, get lost wherever you came from, don't say I didn't give you a chance."</p><p></p><p>After Lu Changsheng spoke, the entire venue fell silent.</p><p></p><p>The human race's crowd felt a chill running through their heads!</p><p></p><p>Jian Wuhui and the others looked bewildered and stunned at the young man in blue... and their hearts were completely tense!</p><p></p><p>Lu Changsheng's previous words still had room for reconciliation.</p><p></p><p>But after this sentence, the human race has offended the entire divine-demonic battlefield of the myriad races!</p><p></p><p>There is no longer the slightest room for reconciliation!!</p><p></p><p>They had thought that Lu Changsheng taking over the conversation was to say some conciliatory words.</p><p></p><p>But they never imagined that he would still be uncompromising, his words sharp and unyielding.</p><p></p><p>The person who looked so gentle and jade-like, the words he uttered were so... domineering!</p>

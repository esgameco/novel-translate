        <h1>Chapter 251</h1>
        <div class="content">
            <p>Here is the full English translation of the Chinese excerpt:</p><p></p><p>The Tianyin Monastery is located on the peak of the Miluo Snow Mountain, south of the Divine Emperor's Palace, in the Crimson Celestial Divine Realm. (-_-) 6â‘¨sHu.com (-_-)</p><p></p><p>It is the highest sacred place in the hearts of all the Dao and Buddhist cultivators in the entire Ancestral Heavenly Divine Realm.</p><p></p><p>The reason is simple - the Mirror Observation Buddha Master is recognized as the leader of the Dao and Buddhist practitioners in the Ancestral Heavenly Divine Realm!</p><p></p><p>It is rumored that even the Ancestral Heavenly Divine Emperor would show reverence to the Mirror Observation Buddha Master of the Tianyin Monastery.</p><p></p><p>At this moment.</p><p></p><p>In the Tianyin Monastery, an old monk stood with one palm raised in front of his chest, sitting in meditation in the Buddha Hall, inhaling the lingering sandalwood fragrance, eyes closed in deep contemplation.</p><p></p><p>He was unaware that the Buddha lamp in front of him, which had been burning brightly before, had quietly extinguished at some point.</p><p></p><p>After a while, Huihai finished his meditation and slowly opened his aged eyes.</p><p></p><p>He was immediately stunned.</p><p></p><p>He stared blankly at the extinguished Buddha lamp, his lips trembling, his face turning pale.</p><p></p><p>"Buddha... Buddha Master!"</p><p></p><p>The next moment, Huihai's eyes turned red, and he abruptly stood up, staggering towards the exit of the Buddha Hall.</p><p></p><p>He went to the heavy bell tower, grasped the bell clapper, and gritted his teeth, exerting all his strength to strike the great bell.</p><p></p><p>Dong! Dong! Dong! Dong! Dong!...</p><p></p><p>Suddenly, nine consecutive bell tolls resounded, like mournful cries, echoing through the Tianyin Monastery and the Miluo Snow Mountain.</p><p></p><p>In the Tianyin Monastery, all the monks' faces changed drastically, and they quickly raised their heads, looking towards the Buddha Hall.</p><p></p><p>Many of the relatively higher-ranking monks hastily rushed towards the Buddha Hall.</p><p></p><p>Nine bell tolls... the Tianyin Monastery had never experienced this before!</p><p></p><p>...</p><p></p><p>When the monks arrived at the Buddha Hall, they saw Huihai kneeling there, embracing the bell clapper and weeping bitterly.</p><p></p><p>"Elder Brother Huihai!"</p><p></p><p>The monks hurriedly went to help Huihai up. They were filled with a very ominous premonition.</p><p></p><p>Sure enough, they heard Huihai choke out,</p><p></p><p>"Fellow disciples... the Buddha Master's Buddha lamp has been extinguished. The Buddha Master has likely passed away in the Ninth World Calamity!"</p><p></p><p>What?!</p><p></p><p>The monks' hair stood on end, and their expressions became frozen.</p><p></p><p>Subsequently, they stumbled towards the Buddha Hall. When they saw the extinguished soul lamp, their eyes instantly became blurred, and they felt the world spinning before them, unable to stand steady.</p><p></p><p>The Buddha Master... truly...</p><p></p><p>How... how could this be? With the Buddha Master's supreme Buddha nature, he had safely traversed the first eight worlds. How could he have made a mistake in the Ninth World...?</p><p></p><p>But the reality was right before their eyes.</p><p></p><p>This Buddha lamp belonged to the Buddha Master alone...</p><p></p><p>"Buddha Master!"</p><p></p><p>The monks successively knelt down in a daze, their eyes vacant, tears streaming down their faces.</p><p></p><p>For a moment, grief permeated the Buddha Hall.</p><p></p><p>After a long while, the people's emotions gradually calmed down.</p><p></p><p>Huihai looked at the Buddha lamp and hoarsely said, "From the moment the Buddha Master failed in his calamity crossing, our Buddhist Dao will no longer have a leader, and it will decline for countless years. Once this news spreads, our Buddhist cultivators will be utterly demoralized..."</p><p></p><p>"Our Buddhist Dao has flourished for countless years in the Ancestral Heavenly Divine Realm, but now it has finally begun to decline."</p><p></p><p>The monks remained silent upon hearing this.</p><p></p><p>An existence like the Buddha Master is truly irreplaceable in the world. They did not know what would become of their Buddhist Dao without him.</p><p></p><p>If this news were to reach the Tian Yan Taoist Observatory and those Taoist practitioners...</p><p></p><p>All along, their Buddhist Dao and the Taoist teachings have been like fire and water. With the Buddha Master's passing, the future events would be truly unpredictable, like an impending storm.</p><p></p><p>"Elder Brother Huihai's implication, could it be that we should conceal the Buddha Master's passing? But I, as a disciple, cannot agree to this! The Buddha Master was highly respected and renowned throughout the Ancestral Heavenly Realm. Now that he has passed, we must handle the Buddha Master's affairs with the utmost reverence!"</p><p></p><p>"I also cannot agree. Even if we hide it, how long can we keep it a secret? Our Buddhist Dao..."</p><p></p><p>Here is the full English translation of the Chinese excerpt:</p><p></p><p>"It is impossible for there to be such a brilliant and talented Buddhist master again!" </p><p></p><p>"Elder Huihai, could it be that you are afraid this news will be known by the Tian Yan Taoist Observation, and they will come to cause trouble for our Tianyin Temple? There is no need to be afraid! Even if the Tian Yan Taoist Observation wants to save face, if they want to start a great war between Buddhism and Taoism, they still need to ask if the Ancestral Heavenly God Emperor is willing!"</p><p></p><p>"........"</p><p></p><p>Hearing the resounding words of the junior disciple, Huihai closed his eyes and said, "My fellow disciples have misunderstood the meaning of the elder."</p><p></p><p>The monks were slightly taken aback, their expressions becoming a bit awkward.</p><p></p><p>"Ah... you all should go down first, the elder wishes to be alone and quiet for a while." Huihai sighed weakly and waved his sleeve.</p><p></p><p>The monks pursed their lips, paid a sorrowful bow towards the soul lamp of the Buddha Master, and silently left.</p><p></p><p>Huihai then said, "After you all leave, spread the news of the Buddha Master's passing throughout the Six Great Spiritual Realms, so that the Buddha Master's posthumous affairs can be handled with great honor."</p><p></p><p>The monks sighed lightly, clasped their hands together, chanted a Buddhist scripture, and then departed in silence.</p><p></p><p>In the Buddha Hall.</p><p></p><p>Huihai clasped his hands together, silently gazing at the soul lamp.</p><p></p><p>"Buddha Master... now that you are gone, I fear our Buddhist Dao will struggle greatly under the pressure of the Tian Yan Taoist Observation..."</p><p></p><p>"Our Buddhist Dao cannot be without a leader even for a day."</p><p></p><p>"Forgive Huihai for overstepping."</p><p></p><p>...</p><p></p><p>In the slums of Mingxin City.</p><p></p><p>Lu Changsheng looked at the long line of people in front of him, waving towards the awkward Xiao Tong beside him, and sighed, "Everyone, go stand in front of that little sister, it is she who will treat your illnesses, not me."</p><p></p><p>Huh?</p><p></p><p>Suddenly, many gazes filled with doubt and worry fell upon Xiao Tong.</p><p></p><p>This little girl who is barely taller than a table?</p><p></p><p>She looks so young, can she really do it?</p><p></p><p>It's not that they don't trust her, but treating illnesses is no child's play. </p><p></p><p>If a mistake is made, given their conditions, they won't have the money to go to the big hospitals.</p><p></p><p>Xiao Tong saw this and forcibly calmed herself down. She straightened her chest and said in a trembling voice, "Please, everyone, believe in me, I can do it!"</p><p></p><p>The crowd: "......"</p><p></p><p>You can do it, why are you trembling?</p><p></p><p>Lu Changsheng glanced at her, then looked at the hesitant crowd and smiled calmly, "Don't worry, everyone. I am the renowned divine doctor, and this little girl is barely my disciple. She has already graduated, so you can all trust her to treat your illnesses. I will be here watching over her."</p><p></p><p>"Doctor, if you are truly a divine doctor, why don't you treat us yourself..." a small child timidly asked.</p><p></p><p>It's not that he doesn't believe in the young girl dressed as a doctor, it's just that she looks about the same age as him, how could she have mastered such complex medical skills...</p><p></p><p>Lu Changsheng laughed, stroking his non-existent beard, and joked, "Little friend, as a divine doctor, I naturally cannot casually use my skills."</p><p></p><p>After all, he brought Xiao Tong here to let her gain practical experience, how could he interfere?</p><p></p><p>The child stared at Lu Changsheng's chin for a while, confirming that there was no beard there, and was about to say something when Xiao Tong suddenly looked at him intently and said, "You've been having a lot of nightmares at night, and have been wetting the bed for many days in a row, haven't you?"</p><p></p><p>The child was dumbfounded!</p><p></p><p>The crowd was also stunned, staring at Xiao Tong in amazement. They all knew the child in the slums, and they knew that Ludan had been having nightmares at night and wetting the bed for a long time.</p><p></p><p>But how did this young girl know?</p><p></p><p>Amazing! </p><p></p><p>This is truly a divine doctor!</p>

        <h1>Chapter 545</h1>
        <div class="content">
            <p>Here is my translation of the Chinese excerpt you provided:</p><p></p><p>The air fell silent!</p><p></p><p>Cao Yulong, Huang Yulang, and the townspeople had turned deathly pale, too frightened to listen further. Many of them had even covered their ears in fear.</p><p></p><p>The girls from the Spring Pavilion were also scared, but their eyes couldn't help shining with a moist luster.</p><p></p><p>Mr. Lu is so majestic...</p><p></p><p>Driven by a desire for strength, their faces flushed and their heartbeats quickened, their legs involuntarily clenching a little tighter.</p><p></p><p>While they were worried and tense, they also felt strangely thrilled, because he was cursing the Tianwu Sect! And without any reservations!</p><p></p><p>In the entire venue, only Zui Qiancheng nodded silently.</p><p></p><p>Mr. Lu is right, the Tianwu Sect... is indeed trash.</p><p></p><p>It's just a sect of a small country, what does it amount to?</p><p></p><p>Not just Mr. Lu, even if Zui Qiancheng were to come, it would be as easy as blowing a breath of air.</p><p></p><p>If Zui Qiancheng wished it, the entire Star Luo Empire could be destroyed in an instant.</p><p></p><p>This is not boasting, but simply the truth.</p><p></p><p>However, Zui Qiancheng of course would not do such a thing, as a Saint of Heaven and Earth, he would not even kill good-natured common folk, even if it cost him his life.</p><p></p><p>Zui Qiancheng believes that Mr. Lu would absolutely not do such a thing either.</p><p></p><p>The elders bowed their heads tightly, their hearts filled with terror, and Wang Shu was even trembling in fear.</p><p></p><p>The Tianwu Sect, what trash is that?? If these words were to spread, the entire Star Luo Empire would be in an uproar.</p><p></p><p>"You may leave," Lu Changsheng suddenly said.</p><p></p><p>The elders of the various sects raised their heads abruptly, their faces filled with joy!</p><p></p><p>Especially Wang Shu and Song Ren, who had narrowly escaped with their lives, began to breathe heavily!</p><p></p><p>"Thank... thank you, Your Excellency!" </p><p></p><p>Wang Shu was the first to kowtow.</p><p></p><p>The elders of the various sects made the ground tremble with their kowtows!</p><p></p><p>But Lu Changsheng paid them no mind, rising from his seat and walking towards the study, his voice carrying:</p><p></p><p>"Old Xu, I'm going to get my fishing gear, let's go fishing?"</p><p></p><p>"Okay!" Zui Qiancheng quickly responded, then happily hurried towards the noodle shop to get the fishing gear.</p><p></p><p>Everyone let out a huge sigh of relief, and quickly left without daring to look back. </p><p></p><p>Huang Yulang and the old madam, along with the girls, also hurriedly returned to the Qingqing Pavilion!</p><p></p><p>In the blink of an eye, only Wang Shu and the others were left kneeling in front of the Qingqing Pavilion.</p><p></p><p>Wang Shu trembled as he got up, grabbed Song Ren, not caring if he was in pain, and rushed out of the town!</p><p></p><p>One elder also went to carry Lin Elder, and then hurriedly left this place of trouble along with the other elders!</p><p></p><p>The painful cries of Song Ren and Lin Elder could be heard all along the way!</p><p></p><p>...</p><p></p><p>Outside Jixiang Town.</p><p></p><p>Lu Changsheng and Zui Qiancheng were strolling along with their fishing gear.</p><p></p><p>"Mr. Lu is kind-hearted," Zui Qiancheng suddenly said.</p><p></p><p>Lu Changsheng raised an eyebrow, "Oh? How so?"</p><p></p><p>Zui Qiancheng: "Qiancheng knows that Mr. Lu was afraid the bloodshed would frighten the townspeople."</p><p></p><p>Lu Changsheng let out a light laugh and said, "Master Zui has a pretty sharp mind."</p><p></p><p>Zui Qiancheng felt embarrassed, ah, he also wanted to have a transcendent air, but in front of Lu Changsheng, it was hard to maintain his image.</p><p></p><p>"So do you know what to do next?" Lu Changsheng said indifferently.</p><p></p><p>"Qiancheng understands Mr. Lu's intention," Zui Qiancheng said, then closed his eyes and quickly opened them again: "Mr. Lu, those two from the Tianwu Sect have already been dealt with, and Qiancheng has also given the other sect elders a little lesson."</p><p></p><p>"Good, let's go fishing," Lu Changsheng said with a slight smile.</p><p></p><p>Since the other sects' elders hadn't really provoked him, Lu Changsheng naturally had no intention of killing them. He was not the type to indiscriminately slaughter the innocent.</p><p></p><p>...</p><p></p><p>At the same time, in a distant green field somewhere.</p><p></p><p>Two warm pools of blood were spilled from the sky.</p><p></p><p>Just now,</p><p>Wang Shu was frantically fleeing while carrying Song Ren.</p><p></p><p>Thinking they were already a thousand miles away from Jixiang Town, they were safe.</p><p>But suddenly, an energy surge erupted from their chests.</p><p></p><p>Here is the full English translation of the Chinese excerpt:</p><p></p><p>Wang Sao and Song Ren were suddenly terrified, their souls fleeing, and their hearts filled with despair!</p><p></p><p>"Wang Sao!! I've warned you repeatedly not to be reckless, but you just wouldn't listen! Now you've killed me!! In my next life, I, Song Ren, will never be on good terms with you!! Damn it!!"</p><p></p><p>At the last moment, Song Ren finally couldn't hold back anymore and erupted.</p><p></p><p>Wang Sao's lips trembled, and he, trapped in fear, didn't even hear what Song Ren was saying, only murmuring repeatedly, "He... how can he be so strong, why, why..."</p><p></p><p>Boom! Boom!!</p><p></p><p>At the same time, the various elders who were fleeing in all directions were also struck down from thin air.</p><p></p><p>They fell from the sky like cannonballs, severely injured, though not dead.</p><p></p><p>...</p><p></p><p>The lake.</p><p></p><p>Lu Changsheng had made a comfortable nest and now sat down leisurely under the shade, smiling and saying:</p><p></p><p>"Xiao Zui, how about coming to my school to be a teaching assistant?"</p><p></p><p>Zui Qiancheng, who was making the nest, was taken aback, and his expression turned slightly bitter as he said with difficulty, "Mr. Lu, I still have the noodle shop to run. The villagers are used to Qiancheng's noodles, and if they suddenly can't get them, they'll go crazy."</p><p></p><p>"Oh?" Lu Changsheng teased, "Now you're telling me this? I didn't see you caring about them when you were fishing."</p><p></p><p>"..." Zui Qiancheng was momentarily at a loss for words and could only laugh awkwardly.</p><p></p><p>Lu Changsheng's eyes flashed, and he asked with a smile, "By the way, how were those two jars of wine? Did they meet your approval?"</p><p></p><p>Zui Qiancheng was taken aback, and he swallowed hard, saying, "Mr. Lu, you're too kind. That Xihun Liquor and Rumjuan Liquor are truly extraordinary wines. I've never tasted anything so delicious. By the way, do you still have any?"</p><p></p><p>Lu Changsheng waved his hand, "No, no, the last two jars were all given to you."</p><p></p><p>Zui Qiancheng was anxious, forgetting about the nest, and suddenly stood up, "Mr. Lu, how can they be gone? Didn't you say you brewed them yourself?!"</p><p></p><p>Lu Changsheng narrowed his eyes and sighed, "Ah, they're really gone. That self-brewed thing was just a lie to trick you."</p><p></p><p>Zui Qiancheng's mouth went dry, and he became anxious like an ant on a hot pan. Soon, he calmed down and looked up to the sky, bitterly smiling.</p><p></p><p>He, Zui Qiancheng, had really been manipulated by Mr. Lu...</p><p></p><p>He now understood.</p><p></p><p>The fishing was nothing, he, Zui Qiancheng, was the pitiful fish.</p><p></p><p>"Mr. Lu, is your school still short of a teaching assistant?"</p><p></p><p>Zui Qiancheng coughed dryly.</p><p></p><p>Lu Changsheng opened one eye and glanced at him, saying indifferently, "Ah, I suddenly don't feel like recruiting a teaching assistant anymore. I'll just manage on my own."</p><p></p><p>This time, Zui Qiancheng panicked, immediately hugging the rice used for the nest and scurrying to Lu Changsheng's side, pleading, "Mr. Lu, you must hire Qiancheng as the teaching assistant! Qiancheng has some insights when it comes to teaching."</p><p></p><p>Lu Changsheng sat up and said, "Then answer me a question, and if you can answer it, I'll graciously hire you as the teaching assistant."</p><p></p><p>"Mr. Lu, please ask!" Zui Qiancheng quickly said.</p><p></p><p>He was inwardly bitter.</p><p></p><p>Zui Qiancheng had never felt so cheap before. Earlier, when Mr. Lu had actively offered him the teaching assistant position, he had pretended to be reserved. But now, the situation had changed, and he was begging to be hired as the assistant.</p><p></p><p>Sigh.</p><p></p><p>Cheap, so cheap, how could he be so cheap?</p><p></p><p>"Hehe, I want to ask, why is it that scallion noodles have no taste? I've been eating them for a while, but I still can't taste anything in them, ah."</p><p></p><p>Lu Changsheng shook his head and sighed.</p><p></p><p>After saying that, he picked up the fishing rod, baited the hook, and cast it out.</p><p></p><p>Huh?</p><p></p><p>Zui Qiancheng was taken aback, and his brow furrowed deeply...</p><p></p><p>To be honest, he also really wanted to know the answer to this question that was thrown out at the beginning.</p>

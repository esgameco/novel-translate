        <h1>Chapter 474</h1>
        <div class="content">
            <p>Here is the full English translation of the Chinese excerpt:</p><p></p><p>The weather was fine, the sky was clear, and under the warm sun, the sea breeze caressed the heart.</p><p></p><p>A massive ship was docked at the shore, and at this moment, many cultivators were boarding the ship.</p><p></p><p>"Big brother, do we really have to go to the Sea of Laws?" </p><p></p><p>"Yes, we must go!"</p><p></p><p>On the shore, there were two barefoot, shirtless young men, one fat and one thin.</p><p></p><p>The fat youth's face was full of fear and worry, while the thin youth was relatively calm and resolute.</p><p></p><p>Clearly, the thin youth was the "big brother" the fat one had mentioned.</p><p></p><p>The fat one was called Chen Pang, and the thin one was called Xiao Chai.</p><p></p><p>"But big brother, the Sea of Laws is very dangerous. What if we end up dying there?" Chen Pang said cautiously, glancing at the calm sea.</p><p></p><p>Xiao Chai gave Chen Pang a sidelong glance and said impatiently, "We've already bought the tickets. Do you want to back out now? Even if we die, at least we'll die together! What are you afraid of?"</p><p></p><p>Chen Pang looked troubled. "Big brother, I..."</p><p></p><p>"Enough with the nonsense. Hurry up and get on the ship, don't let it leave without us. You should know how hard it is to get these tickets, we've been waiting for decades!"</p><p></p><p>With that, Xiao Chai didn't bother to waste more words, grabbed the reluctant Chen Pang, and boarded the ship.</p><p></p><p>After Xiao Chai and Chen Pang boarded the ship, they each took out a jade token and showed it to the ship guard, which was likely their boarding pass, or ticket.</p><p></p><p>After the ticket check was completed, Xiao Chai and Chen Pang put away the jade tokens and first surveyed the many figures on the deck - there were people, demons, and cultivators, causing them to swallow hard.</p><p></p><p>"Big brother, these people all look fierce and terrifying. Is it really safe for us to be on the same ship with them?" Chen Pang said in a low voice, his face pale.</p><p></p><p>"Hmph, what's there to be afraid of? These cultivators are going to the Sea of Laws, and most of them are probably there to comprehend the laws, so their strength is about the same as ours. What's there to be afraid of?" Xiao Chai replied calmly.</p><p></p><p>Chen Pang nodded, and after looking around, suddenly pointed to a corner and said, "Big brother, let's go sit over there."</p><p></p><p>Xiao Chai looked in the direction Chen Pang pointed and saw a young man in blue robes sitting cross-legged. After examining him, Xiao Chai smiled and said, "Okay, let's go there."</p><p></p><p>The two then headed towards the corner, and Chen Pang chuckled, "Big brother, among all these cultivators, that young man in blue robes seems the most normal. At least he doesn't look fierce, and he should be easier to get along with, especially since we'll be sailing for a long time to the Sea of Laws."</p><p></p><p>When they reached the spot, they first smiled politely at the young man in blue robes, then sat down.</p><p></p><p>At that moment, a loud ship horn sounded, and the entire ship began to tremble, indicating that it was about to depart.</p><p></p><p>Soon, the ship started moving, slowly drifting away from the shore. All the cultivators on the deck stood by the railings, watching the ship sail farther and farther away, not knowing if they would return alive from the perilous journey to the Sea of Laws.</p><p></p><p>As the ship moved some distance from the shore, a column of light suddenly erupted from the rear, splitting the surface of the sea. With the tremendous propulsive force, the massive ship disappeared from the horizon in a flash of light.</p><p></p><p>...</p><p></p><p>On the deck, Chen Pang stood up, looked at the boundless sea, and sniffed the salty sea breeze. Then he glanced at the luxurious private cabins and sighed bitterly, "Big brother, I wish we could stay in the luxury suites."</p><p></p><p>Xiao Chai's mouth twitched, as if Chen Pang was implying that he didn't want to stay in the luxury suites. He then shrugged helplessly and said, "Even just getting tickets for the deck seats took us decades. The luxury suite tickets are even harder to come by... And besides, we were able to get on the ship at all, which is already a great accomplishment."</p><p></p><p>Here is the full English translation of the Chinese excerpt:</p><p></p><p>"Those who have booked the suites must have some connections and background behind them. We two poor nobodies shouldn't demand so much, right?" </p><p></p><p>Chen Pang's gaze sharpened as he solemnly said, "Brother, I don't allow you to speak of yourself that way."</p><p></p><p>Xiao Chai chuckled, "Okay, you may be a nobody, but I'm not."</p><p></p><p>Chen Pang's face darkened, about to say something, but was interrupted by Xiao Chai gesturing him to be quiet.</p><p></p><p>Chen Pang was slightly puzzled, then saw Xiao Chai glance at the blue-robed monk and subtly nod at him, whispering, "Fatty, you go negotiate, you're better at this than me."</p><p></p><p>Chen Pang nodded, then his eyes darted around as he cupped his hands and smiled sheepishly at the blue-robed monk:</p><p></p><p>"Fellow Daoist, were we disturbing you with our argument?"</p><p></p><p>Lu Changsheng opened his eyes and looked at Chen Pang, softly replying, "Yes, you were."</p><p></p><p>Chen Pang and Xiao Chai: "......"</p><p></p><p>Regaining his composure, Chen Pang scratched his head, while Xiao Chai cupped his hands and smiled, "Fellow Daoist, sorry about that. Shall we find another spot?... Fatty, let's go..."</p><p></p><p>Xiao Chai finished speaking and was about to usher Chen Pang to change seats.</p><p></p><p>Suddenly, Lu Changsheng chuckled, "You two, please sit. I was just joking. The environment on the deck is already chaotic, how could there be any disturbance?"</p><p></p><p>"Hehe."</p><p></p><p>Hearing this, Chen Pang and Xiao Chai sat back down, their thoughts aligned - this blue-robed monk indeed seemed quite amiable, just as they had hoped.</p><p></p><p>"Fellow Daoist, I'm Xiao Chai, and this is my brother Chen Pang. We'll be in your care for the upcoming journey."</p><p></p><p>Xiao Chai promptly introduced them.</p><p></p><p>Lu Changsheng gently nodded, "Lu Changsheng."</p><p></p><p>"Ah, so you are Fellow Daoist Lu! We've long heard of your esteemed name!" Xiao Chai immediately flattered, then quickly asked, "Fellow Daoist Lu, are you also going to the Realm of the Laws to comprehend the laws?"</p><p></p><p>Lu Changsheng shook his head and smiled, "No, I'm just going there to play around."</p><p></p><p>Huh? To play around?</p><p></p><p>Xiao Chai and Chen Pang exchanged glances.</p><p></p><p>But soon, they realized something, their hearts pounding!</p><p></p><p>If this Fellow Daoist Lu was not going to the Realm of the Laws to comprehend the laws, could it be that he had already comprehended the laws?</p><p></p><p>Whoa, that would make him far more capable than them.</p><p></p><p>At this moment, Lu Changsheng asked, "How about you? Are you going to comprehend the laws?"</p><p></p><p>"Mm-hmm, Chen Pang and I are going to the Realm of the Laws to comprehend the laws. For this boat ticket, we've been waiting for decades!" Xiao Chai sighed.</p><p></p><p>Chen Pang, on the other hand, was scratching his head and chuckling awkwardly. If it weren't for Xiao Chai insisting on coming, he definitely wouldn't have come to the Realm of the Laws - it's too dangerous.</p><p></p><p>"Must one comprehend the laws in the Realm of the Laws?" Lu Changsheng asked with a smile.</p><p></p><p>Hearing this, Xiao Chai and Chen Pang exchanged glances again, and Xiao Chai curiously asked, "Huh? Doesn't Fellow Daoist Lu need to comprehend the laws in the Realm of the Laws?"</p><p></p><p>Lu Changsheng chuckled, "When did I say I had comprehended the laws?"</p><p></p><p>Xiao Chai and Chen Pang were suddenly embarrassed, realizing they had misunderstood.</p><p></p><p>But this Fellow Daoist Lu was indeed a peculiar person - even without comprehending the laws, he was still going to the Realm of the Laws just to "play around"... How strange.</p><p></p><p>And most importantly, he had such a bold heart, daring to go to the dangerous Realm of the Laws without even comprehending the laws...</p><p></p><p>After all, they wouldn't go to the Realm of the Laws if it weren't for the purpose of comprehending the laws!</p>

        <h1>Chapter 330</h1>
        <div class="content">
            <p>Here is the full English translation of the Chinese excerpt:</p><p></p><p>Li Shuyan took a step back, trembling as he faced Lu Changsheng's calm gaze. "S-sir..."</p><p></p><p>The old turtle was slightly perplexed, but wisely remained silent.</p><p></p><p>"Shuyan, your words and actions are not aligned. It's normal to want to become stronger, to have ambition. But as I've told you before, you must keep your true self, and know that you can't become a big fatty with just one mouthful."</p><p></p><p>"You come from the Ancestral Heavens, and compared to the heavenly prodigies of the Demon-God Battlefield, your foundation is indeed shallow. But how long have you been following me? You've already reached the mid-stage of the Divine Yang Realm, and with the Myriad Forging Flame Technique, you possess the strength to rival those in the Divine Storehouse Realm."</p><p></p><p>"Isn't that enough?"</p><p></p><p>Lu Changsheng spoke softly.</p><p></p><p>Li Shuyan knelt down, his voice trembling. "Enough... enough, sir. Shuyan didn't mean that."</p><p></p><p>"It's already good that I let you follow me. Other than doing some odd jobs, you're useless." Lu Changsheng said indifferently.</p><p></p><p>Li Shuyan's pupils trembled, and he lowered his head, daring not to speak.</p><p></p><p>"This is the second time I've said this to you. When I say it a third time, that will be the day of your death."</p><p></p><p>Lu Changsheng turned and walked away leisurely.</p><p></p><p>As for Li Shuyan, he was almost frightened out of his wits.</p><p></p><p>"Ah."</p><p></p><p>Seeing this, the old turtle lifted Li Shuyan up and hurried after Lu Changsheng.</p><p></p><p>...</p><p></p><p>Months later.</p><p></p><p>Lu Changsheng's group finally arrived at the outskirts of the Human Clan's territory.</p><p></p><p>The Human Clan was located in the southeast direction of the Demon-God Battlefield, not too far away.</p><p></p><p>The clan's habitat was likely related to their ranking on the Myriad Clan List.</p><p></p><p>"Master, this should be the Human Clan's territory. That Dragon Clan's Ao Xing didn't lie to us," the old turtle said with a smile as he looked at the patrolling figures in the hazy battlefield.</p><p></p><p>Li Shuyan remained silent, not daring to look at Lu Changsheng, as if he was still haunted by fear.</p><p></p><p>Lu Changsheng nodded slightly and stepped forward.</p><p></p><p>The old turtle looked at Li Shuyan and said with a smile, "Shuyan, cheer up. If you really can't do it, you can leave Master. Master has never forced you to follow him."</p><p></p><p>Li Shuyan's heart stirred a bit, and he replied hesitantly, "Senior Turtle, you jest. It is an honor for Shuyan to follow the sir, even if it's just doing odd jobs. How could I leave?"</p><p></p><p>"Hehe, you little rascal." The old turtle narrowed his eyes.</p><p></p><p>The two then followed behind Lu Changsheng, chatting as they went.</p><p></p><p>Soon, the patrolling figures in the hazy battlefield seemed to have noticed Lu Changsheng's group, and a shout echoed from the distance:</p><p></p><p>"Intruders in the Human Clan's territory! Halt!"</p><p></p><p>Lu Changsheng and the old turtle were unfazed, but Li Shuyan was startled, his heart pounding.</p><p></p><p>"Swoosh, swoosh, swoosh!"</p><p></p><p>The next moment, five figures wielding long spears appeared before Lu Changsheng's group. They were burly men clad in silver-white armor, clearly a patrol squad that had encountered the intruders.</p><p></p><p>The five patrol guards frowned, initially wanting to drive them away, but then their expressions changed as they realized these were fellow clansmen. However, the old turtle's aura was not that of a Human Clan member, and the guards' gazes immediately turned sharp again, staring intently at the old turtle.</p><p></p><p>The old turtle was puzzled, wondering what was wrong with him not being a Human Clan member.</p><p></p><p>The squad leader stepped forward and cupped his hands towards Lu Changsheng, "Fellow Daoist, the elder behind you is..."</p><p></p><p>Although they didn't recognize Lu Changsheng, as long as he was a member of the Human Clan, it didn't matter, for the Human Clan had a vast population, and they couldn't possibly know everyone.</p><p></p><p>Here is the full English translation of the Chinese excerpt:</p><p></p><p>"My mount," Luchang Sheng said with a peaceful smile.</p><p></p><p>Mount? </p><p></p><p>The other four patrol guards exchanged glances.</p><p></p><p>Having a mount was actually quite normal, but in their perception, this hunched old man was no ordinary person - his aura felt very powerful.</p><p></p><p>However, they didn't pay too much attention to it. In this battlefield of gods and demons, the human race was generally very united. They simply made a mental note of the young man's appearance.</p><p></p><p>They then stepped aside to let him pass.</p><p></p><p>Seeing this, Luchang Sheng leisurely walked into the distance, and soon he and his two companions disappeared into the haze of war, vanishing from the patrol guards' sight.</p><p></p><p>"Captain, this person might not be an ordinary individual," one of the patrol guards said, looking at the spot where Luchang Sheng had disappeared.</p><p></p><p>The rest of the patrol guards nodded in agreement - as guards, they were quite adept at judging people. </p><p></p><p>That young man in the blue robe had an air of composure and detachment, even hinting at a sense of superiority.</p><p></p><p>And the mysterious hunched old man was apparently his mount, which was certainly worth pondering over...</p><p></p><p>As for the bald one, he didn't seem too strong, only at the mid-stage of the Divine Yang Realm. Which of them had a cultivation at the Spirit Concealment Realm or above?</p><p></p><p>Especially their captain, whose cultivation was at the Divine Dao Realm.</p><p></p><p>The captain smiled and shook his head: "Yes, that young man in blue should be stronger than me. And his mount doesn't seem weak either... But since he is one of our human race's strong ones, the stronger he is, the better."</p><p></p><p>"Ah, I hope our human race can have more and more powerful experts. We really need them now."</p><p></p><p>"Indeed, if not for Lord Sword Sovereign holding up the fort, our human race might not even be able to maintain a ranking in the Myriad Tribe Rankings."</p><p></p><p>"Heh, originally, with Lord Sword Sovereign's presence in the Combat Power Rankings, our human race should have been able to rank among the top hundred. But alas, it seems we are like thorns in the eyes of those other races, constantly suppressed and even ganged up on!"</p><p></p><p>"How infuriating!"</p><p></p><p>Listening to his subordinates' complaints, the captain pursed his lips and said, "Alright, enough idle chatter. Focus on your duties and continue the patrol!"</p><p></p><p>"Yes, sir!" The guards immediately stood at attention.</p><p></p><p>Meanwhile, in the place where Luchang Sheng and his companions were...</p><p></p><p>The war mist had completely dissipated, and the scene before them became clear.</p><p></p><p>Ahead was a massive city, stretching endlessly from side to side. The city walls were hundreds of feet high, and atop them flew a line of fluttering banners.</p><p></p><p>At a glance, many human cultivators were either walking on the ground or flying in the sky, and there were long queues of people waiting at the towering city gates, looking like ants in comparison.</p><p></p><p>"Wow, what a grand and imposing city!" Li Shuyan exclaimed in amazement.</p><p></p><p>Neither in the Ancestral Heavenly Realm nor the Eternal Vast Realm had he ever seen such a magnificent and colossal city. How many people could this city accommodate? The number was unimaginable.</p><p></p><p>"You two wait for me outside the city for a moment," Luchang Sheng said and then disappeared.</p><p></p><p>The old turtle seemed to know what Luchang Sheng was about to do, so it said to Li Shuyan, "Shuyan, let's go wait for our master outside the city."</p><p></p><p>"Alright," Li Shuyan replied, following the old turtle towards the city gates. Along the way, he said, "Elder Turtle, this city is so huge. Do you think all the human cultivators in the god-demon battlefield live within it?"</p><p></p><p>The old turtle's face darkened, and it replied impatiently, "You fool, we've just arrived. How would I know more about it than you?"</p><p></p><p>"......" Li Shuyan.</p>

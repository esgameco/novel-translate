        <h1>Chapter 324</h1>
        <div class="content">
            <p>Here is the full English translation of the Chinese excerpt:</p><p></p><p>Liu Tu was truly frightened, and right now he wished he could tear his own mouth off. </p><p></p><p>Really, what was he just blabbering about?</p><p></p><p>He had thought Senior Lu had already left the Eternal Realm, but who could have expected him to suddenly appear.</p><p></p><p>Although dying by Senior Lu's sword would indeed be a great fortune, it's still better not to die, of course cough cough.</p><p></p><p>Lu Changsheng nodded slightly, looking at Fu Liangcai, and smiled, "When I first came to the Eternal Realm, I did reside in your Fu Clan for a hundred years."</p><p></p><p>Fu Liangcai was startled, frantically shaking his head: "Senior, your staying in the Fu Clan was the greatest honor for our Fu Clan!"</p><p></p><p>Lu Changsheng placed a box on the table, swept his gaze across the crowd, then silently disappeared from his seat.</p><p></p><p>The hall fell silent for a moment, and the people, seeing that Senior Lu had no more words, puzzled, looked up, only to find that Senior Lu had disappeared without a trace. </p><p></p><p>Only a exquisite wooden box was left on the table.</p><p></p><p>While feeling relieved, the crowd couldn't help but feel a bit regretful.</p><p></p><p>Fu Liangcai slowly walked over and picked up the wooden box. Without opening it, he already knew how precious the contents were to them.</p><p></p><p>Reverence then surfaced in his eyes as he sighed, "The rewards for the top 1,500 in the Heavenly Overlord Assembly are already extremely precious to our two clans. To think that..."</p><p></p><p>Liu Tu and the others nodded in succession, then they all turned towards the sky outside the hall and bowed in unison: "Farewell, Senior!"</p><p></p><p>At this time, the younger generation of Fu Shiyu, Liu Xing, and Fu Tao happened to arrive at the hall, looking somewhat bewildered at the scene.</p><p></p><p>But soon their hearts trembled as they realized which Senior it was!</p><p></p><p>"Father..." Fu Shiyu's eyes flickered, her voice slightly hoarse.</p><p></p><p>Fu Liangcai straightened up, looking at Fu Shiyu and smiled, "Senior Lu came, had a sip of tea, and then left."</p><p></p><p>Fu Shiyu paused, turning to look at the horizon, soon sighing inwardly. That peerless figure of Senior Lu had truly left this time, leaving the Eternal Realm forever, never to be seen again.</p><p></p><p>But she knew, in her lifetime, that azure figure wielding a sword would always be deeply etched in their minds.</p><p></p><p>...</p><p></p><p>In the boundless void, a luxurious flying carriage was speeding through.</p><p></p><p>Outside the carriage, a bald man was sitting there controlling the direction, but his gaze sweeping the profound void was somewhat perplexed.</p><p></p><p>He couldn't help but turn around and awkwardly ask, "Sir, where are we going?"</p><p></p><p>Inside the carriage, Lu Changsheng was leaning back in the seat, his feet propped up on the window, and he leisurely replied, "Linglong Heaven."</p><p></p><p>Linglong Heaven?</p><p></p><p>Li Shuyan paused, then suddenly remembered - wasn't that the world the old turtle and Tongxin had been thrown into before?</p><p></p><p>He soon felt awkward again. He had long forgotten the location of Linglong Heaven, and wanted to ask but didn't dare, afraid of being told he was asking too many questions.</p><p></p><p>Lu Changsheng saw this and a stream of light flashed into Li Shuyan's mind.</p><p></p><p>Li Shuyan paused, then immediately understood, and quickly began to adjust the direction of the flying carriage, speeding towards a void.</p><p></p><p>...</p><p></p><p>Linglong Heaven, the Human Realm.</p><p></p><p>Located in the Caolang Continent, the Carefree Sect, although it had no rank, its overall strength had long surpassed the First Rank, and it could be called the hegemon of Linglong Heaven without exaggeration.</p><p></p><p>Everyone wanted to join the Carefree Sect, but...</p><p></p><p>Here is the full English translation of the Chinese excerpt:</p><p></p><p>Alas, the Carefree Sect no longer seems to be accepting disciples, with only a few tens of thousands of members left in the entire sect.</p><p></p><p>Xin 69 Book Bar â†’ 69shux.com</p><p></p><p>Carefree Sect, the martial field.</p><p></p><p>Many disciples were practicing cultivation techniques and martial arts, with bursts of fierce light and fluctuations erupting from time to time.</p><p></p><p>There were also quite a few disciples dueling with each other, their feet moving swiftly as their figures shifted and teleported, as if the entire martial field was filled with their shadows.</p><p></p><p>The speed was incredibly fast, almost impossible to capture, with such unimaginable speeds during the duels.</p><p></p><p>"Whew, Brother Cai Xu and Brother Huang Bin have been advancing so rapidly ever since they were promoted to the Outer Sect, they're almost about to complete the first volume of the Carefree Techniques!"</p><p></p><p>"Ah, you don't even realize how hard Brother Cai Xu and Brother Huang Bin have been working. It's as if they've taken some kind of 'chicken blood' tonic, at this rate they'll soon break through to the Chaos Immortal Lord realm and become Inner Sect disciples."</p><p></p><p>"Sigh, our Carefree Sect has such abundant resources, in the past one could become an Inner Sect disciple just by reaching the Golden Immortal realm, but now the requirement has been raised to the Chaos Immortal Lord realm, it's become so much more difficult!"</p><p></p><p>"Hehe, in our entire Carefree Sect, the lowest cultivation level seems to be our fellow disciples at the Miscellaneous Peak, and they're all at the Golden Immortal realm already. Earthly Immortals and Heavenly Immortals are nowhere to be seen."</p><p></p><p>Many disciples were discussing animatedly, filled with sighs, but also pride in their eyes.</p><p></p><p>In this Linglong World, their Carefree Sect was truly formidable.</p><p></p><p>It's just that their Sect Master has been elusive, not seen for a long time since that banquet.</p><p></p><p>Meanwhile, on the high mountains of the Carefree Sect.</p><p></p><p>Peng Fang, Left Qiu Shan, Su Qianghe, Zhao Wuyu, and Yin Jiukai stood there, gazing down at the martial field, their faces not filled with contentment, but rather with worry.</p><p></p><p>"Sigh," Peng Fang let out a deep breath and said, "On the surface, our Carefree Sect seems to be thriving, but..."</p><p></p><p>Left Qiu Shan and the others remained silent, naturally understanding the meaning of the Elder.</p><p></p><p>In this Linglong World, their Carefree Sect was dominant, seemingly doing well, but in reality, due to the lack of rivals, they had become too complacent.</p><p></p><p>Now, they feared they had almost reached their limit, and future progress would be exceptionally slow.</p><p></p><p>Especially for the five of them as Elders, they had all broken through to the realm beyond Immortal Ancestor with the help of the Sect Master's Carefree Techniques, a realm they called the Divine Element.</p><p></p><p>But once they reached the Divine Element realm, it would be extremely difficult to advance further, as if the Linglong World's upper limit was right here.</p><p></p><p>The potential of the Carefree Techniques was immense, far beyond just the Divine Element realm, but unfortunately, it was constrained by the Linglong World.</p><p></p><p>The Sect's executives and protectors like Zhu Xingqiu had also reached the Immortal Emperor or even Immortal Ancestor realms, and the two Holy Sons Lin Dong and Tong Xin were at the Immortal Emperor realm as well.</p><p></p><p>As for the core disciples like Left Qi Ran, they were mostly at the Immortal King or Immortal Saint realms, with Inner Sect disciples at the Chaos Immortal Lord realm, Outer Sect disciples at the Great Dao Golden Immortal realm, and Miscellaneous Peak disciples at the Golden Immortal realm.</p><p></p><p>Oh yes, there was also that hunchbacked old man who came back with Tong Xin, what was his name again? Turtle Grandpa or something?</p><p></p><p>The old man was simply terrifying, shocking Peng Fang and the others immensely!</p><p></p><p>The reason was that when the old man first arrived, his strength was about the same as theirs, or even a bit weaker.</p><p></p><p>Yet, after a single period of closed-door cultivation, when he emerged, he was able to easily pin them all down and beat them with just one hand! Effortlessly!</p><p></p><p>Keep in mind, they had already broken through to the Divine Element realm at that time!</p><p></p><p>They were shocked and puzzled, how could this be possible?</p><p></p><p>Had the old man surpassed the Divine Element realm? But wasn't the Linglong World's upper limit just the Divine Element realm?</p><p></p><p>They remembered hastily asking the old man about it, but he had just waved his hand casually and said something like "I, Turtle Grandpa, can cultivate without any constraints," and then left them dumbfounded.</p>

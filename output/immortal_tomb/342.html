        <h1>Chapter 342</h1>
        <div class="content">
            <p>Here is the full English translation of the Chinese excerpt:</p><p></p><p>"We can set out now. ‚ô™üê†‚ùª‚ûà·îïùìóùìæ–ñ.cùï†Áà™üèÜüòæ" </p><p></p><p>As Luchang Sheng's words fell, the five who had gambled their lives with him were startled, their faces turning pale.</p><p></p><p>What a joke, how could they possibly really sacrifice themselves in front of this Taoist monk!</p><p></p><p>At the same time, Zhou Dafu also let out a sigh of relief, and the other nearby Taoist monks started to watch the lively scene.</p><p></p><p>"Fellow Daoist, we are willing to compensate you with spirit crystals, but our lives... that's impossible."</p><p></p><p>"Fellow Daoist, our reckless actions today were our fault, as fellow members of the human race, we hope you won't take it too seriously."</p><p></p><p>"......"</p><p></p><p>The five spoke one after another to Luchang Sheng, but their faces showed displeasure.</p><p></p><p>The commotion here immediately attracted the attention of many people in the square.</p><p></p><p>"Huh?"</p><p></p><p>Miao Fan and Kong Zhen were originally planning to leave, but they noticed the unusual situation in the square.</p><p></p><p>More and more Taoist monks came over to Luchang Sheng's group, as everyone loves to see some excitement.</p><p></p><p>Soon, the crowd learned what had happened, their faces showing shock and deep interest.</p><p></p><p>"Wow, playing it this big?"</p><p></p><p>"Gambling their lives, it seems this person even bet against Senior Miao Fan and won, what a bold spirit!"</p><p></p><p>"Yes, even more terrifying is that Senior Miao Fan really did win... Before this, most people didn't have high hopes for Senior Miao Fan."</p><p></p><p>"Whew, it was those five people who bet against the Taoist monk, and then lost, right? Judging from their expressions, it seems they want to renege..."</p><p></p><p>"Haha, who wants to die when they can live? Let's see how the situation develops, if these five try to renege, there will definitely be a confrontation."</p><p></p><p>"Do you think if it was really Senior Miao Fan who lost, these five would let the Taoist monk go?"</p><p></p><p>"Don't be ridiculous, of course not."</p><p></p><p>"......"</p><p></p><p>The discussions echoing in the square made the five people's faces flush red, and if Miao Fan and Kong Zhen weren't curiously watching, they would have fled long ago.</p><p></p><p>Luchang Sheng quietly watched the five, not too concerned about the countless gazes focused on him.</p><p></p><p>"Tell me, how many spirit crystals do you want? As long as you don't ask for an outrageous amount, we can scrape some together for you."</p><p></p><p>One of them gritted his teeth and said to Luchang Sheng.</p><p></p><p>"The bet was about lives, what use do I have for spirit crystals?" Luchang Sheng lightly chuckled.</p><p></p><p>The five's expressions changed, and their hearts became even more vexed.</p><p></p><p>However, they felt somewhat relieved, as this person was still able to laugh, indicating that he probably wasn't taking them too seriously.</p><p></p><p>It was just the countless gazes and discussions in this place that made them feel embarrassed.</p><p></p><p>The atmosphere became somewhat tense.</p><p></p><p>At this time, Miao Fan and Kong Zhen exchanged a glance and walked over here, and wherever they passed, the crowd parted ways and saluted respectfully!</p><p></p><p>Through the discussions, the two of them also roughly understood the course of events.</p><p></p><p>Unexpectedly, their confrontation had led someone to bet their lives...</p><p></p><p>They had taken it too far.</p><p></p><p>"Senior Miao Fan, Senior Kong Zhen!" </p><p></p><p>Zhou Dafu and the others hurriedly saluted.</p><p></p><p>After all, these two were ranked 10th and 11th on the Battle Ranking, they were considered top powerhouses in the city.</p><p></p><p>At the Shenxuan Realm, they could be considered terrifying.</p><p></p><p>It must be known that the gap between the Shenxuan Realm and the Shendao Realm, though only one level on the surface, was as vast as the difference between the heavens and the earth!</p><p></p><p>On the Shenmo Battlefield, only Shenxuan Realm experts could be considered true powerhouses.</p><p></p><p>"Haha, what's going on?" Miao Fan first looked at Luchang Sheng with surprise, then scanned the surroundings and asked casually.</p><p></p><p>Kong Zhen stood silently beside him, not speaking. Ever since he was pushed out of the top ten of the Battle Ranking by Miao Fan, Miao Fan...</p><p></p><p>Here is the full English translation of the Chinese excerpt:</p><p></p><p>"Lord Miu Fan, it's like this......" Quickly, Zhou Dafeng mustered up his courage and told Luchengsheng about the bet he had made with those five people.</p><p></p><p>Kongzhen then looked at Luchengsheng, scrutinizing him for a while, his eyes filled with surprise.</p><p></p><p>How did this young Taoist disciple know that he would be defeated by Miu Fan?</p><p></p><p>And even dared to bet his life on it......</p><p></p><p>"Senior Kongzhen, we......" </p><p></p><p>At this point, the five people looked at Kongzhen, wanting to say something but hesitating, their meaning unspoken.</p><p></p><p>Kongzhen pondered for a moment, after all, these people had trusted him in the previous confrontation, so he looked at Luchengsheng and smiled: </p><p></p><p>"My young friend, I believe you don't really want their lives either, since they are all fellow cultivators. How about letting them compensate you with some spirit crystals?"</p><p></p><p>Kongzhen believed that since he had said this, the other party would certainly give him this face, for he was a powerful cultivator ranked 11th on the battle list, and was also a Xuan Realm cultivator.</p><p></p><p>Even among the early Xuan Realm cultivators, he was one of the top combat powers.</p><p></p><p>In this Human City, he was already at the peak.</p><p></p><p>There might be many Dao Realm cultivators in the Human City, but Xuan Realm cultivators were absolutely rare, one could even say scarce!</p><p></p><p>There were about hundreds of millions of cultivators in the Human City, but only the top 30 on the battle list were Xuan Realm cultivators!</p><p></p><p>Roughly calculated, including the Earth City, Sky City, and some other regions of the human domain, the entire human domain might only have over a hundred cultivators above the Xuan Realm!</p><p></p><p>This ratio was staggering.</p><p></p><p>If the Dao Realm was the elite combat force, then the Xuan Realm was the core combat force!</p><p></p><p>........</p><p></p><p>Miu Fan stood there, looking at Luchengsheng without saying a word. He also felt that the bet had gotten a bit too big.</p><p></p><p>And as a fellow cultivator on the battle list, a Xuan Realm cultivator like Kongzhen, he should still give him some face.</p><p></p><p>But Luchengsheng did not heed Kongzhen at all, not even glancing at him, still looking at those five people and indifferently said, "Not going to surrender yet? What, do you want me to personally take action?"</p><p></p><p>Kongzhen's expression suddenly stiffened!</p><p></p><p>Miu Fan's pupils also shrank!</p><p></p><p>The cultivators present were all startled! They looked at Luchengsheng in disbelief, all shocked in their hearts!</p><p></p><p>What they were shocked about was that this obscure Taoist disciple actually treated Senior Kongzhen as air, ignoring him!</p><p></p><p>How dare he??</p><p></p><p>Senior Kongzhen, a Xuan Realm great figure, was not only renowned in the human domain, but also had a certain reputation among some races in the entire Divine-Demon Battlefield.</p><p></p><p>Sensing Kongzhen's darkening expression, Zhou Dafeng panicked and quickly looked at Luchengsheng: "Fellow Daoist......"</p><p></p><p>Luchengsheng seemed to not have heard him.</p><p></p><p>As for the five people across, after a moment of bewilderment, they were overjoyed!</p><p></p><p>Good, this Taoist disciple actually dared to ignore Senior Kongzhen!</p><p></p><p>Now their bet was nothing, this person had directly offended Senior Kongzhen!</p><p></p><p>It's better to wait and see if they can get through Kongzhen first!</p><p></p><p>"My young friend, didn't you hear what I said just now?" </p><p></p><p>Kongzhen looked at Luchengsheng and asked again, but the smile on his face was gone.</p><p></p><p>Everyone could see that Kongzhen was now angry, after all, being ignored by an unknown cultivator in front of so many people... If this got out, it would be a huge loss of face for him.</p><p></p><p>Finally, Luchengsheng turned his head to look at Kongzhen. Since this person was a core combat force of the human race, he naturally wouldn't kill him.</p><p></p><p>Then his pupils flashed with a blue light and he said, "Go back where you came from."</p>

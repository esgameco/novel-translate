        <h1>Chapter 43</h1>
        <div class="content">
            <p>Here is my translation of the Chinese excerpt:</p><p></p><p>The Courtyard of the Lord's Manor.</p><p></p><p>In the pavilion,</p><p></p><p>Gu Helin and Lu Changsheng sat facing each other, each with a cup of hot tea in front of them.</p><p></p><p>"Sir, the demonic and mortal realms may have already formed an alliance. A few days ago, demonic beasts attacked, and after five years, they seem to be making a move again," Gu Helin said curiously, glancing at the turtle on Lu Changsheng's shoulder.</p><p></p><p>Lu Changsheng did not say anything about this matter, but instead said, "I observe that your golden core has developed some cracks, and the tribulation for your advancement to the Nascent Soul stage is likely approaching soon."</p><p></p><p>Gu Helin paused, not expecting Lu Changsheng to change the topic so quickly, and then let out a dry laugh, "Sir, your perceptive eyes are correct. The tribulation for our Qingyun Sect is indeed approaching soon."</p><p></p><p>After saying this, a trace of worry appeared on his face as he continued, "This tribulation, whether it comes early or late, it just has to come at this critical juncture. Alas."</p><p></p><p>Lu Changsheng took a sip of tea, then said, "Since you know of the alliance between the demonic and mortal realms, why don't you inform the cultivation sects in the cultivation world about this?"</p><p></p><p>Gu Helin was taken aback, not expecting the topic to return to this, and so he sighed, "Sir, without knowing the specific timing of the demonic and mortal realms' attack, if we were to reveal this information, the Qingyun Sect may end up becoming a laughingstock. And nowadays, the cultivators in the cultivation world have all become rather indifferent..."</p><p></p><p>"That's true, your Qingyun Sect may become a laughingstock, but if the demonic and mortal realms attack without the cultivation world being prepared, many ordinary people will die," Lu Changsheng said softly.</p><p></p><p>Gu Helin felt his mouth and throat go dry, and he fell silent.</p><p></p><p>He recalled his previous request for longevity, but what he truly sought was a sense of righteousness in his heart. He felt a bit ashamed.</p><p></p><p>"Sir, does this mean that we should inform the cultivation world of this matter, no matter what?" Gu Helin asked in a low voice.</p><p></p><p>"How would I know?" Lu Changsheng said, slowly disappearing from the cool pavilion.</p><p></p><p>Seeing this, Gu Helin let out a long sigh after a long while, and after paying his respects in the courtyard, he walked out.</p><p></p><p>Upon reaching the outside, just as he was about to leave, Chen Dadao and the steward happened to pass by. The two hurriedly approached Gu Helin and paid their respects, "Senior Gu, were you here to see the Sir? It seems he has just left."</p><p></p><p>"Haha, I've just seen the Sir," Gu Helin smiled, and then flew away in front of the two.</p><p></p><p>Chen Dadao and the steward exchanged a surprised glance, looked at the courtyard, paid their respects, and quietly withdrew. </p><p></p><p>It would be best not to disturb the Sir, who had just been visited by Senior Gu.</p><p></p><p>...</p><p></p><p>The Capital of the Lishui Kingdom.</p><p></p><p>"Five years have passed, a full five years. Regarding the recent large-scale demonic beast attack that suddenly withdrew, how do you esteemed officials view this?" the Lishui King stood in the grand hall, sweeping his gaze across the officials and speaking in a deep voice.</p><p></p><p>"Ah, our Lishui Kingdom has enjoyed peace for five years, and who would have thought that this time of tranquility would be broken by demonic beasts. It's truly..."</p><p></p><p>"Fortunately, this time there were no casualties."</p><p></p><p>"It's just that we really can't figure out what these demonic beasts are up to."</p><p></p><p>"..."</p><p></p><p>The officials whispered and discussed among themselves, but no one directly answered the Lishui King's question. </p><p></p><p>After all, they truly didn't know.</p><p></p><p>"Boom!"</p><p></p><p>The Lishui King slammed his palm on the table, and the grand hall immediately fell silent, the officials trembling like frightened insects.</p><p></p><p>"Again! Five years ago, it was the same as this! This king knows that you esteemed officials are mortal, but I haven't forced you to go resolve the demonic beasts, have I? I merely asked for your opinions, and yet you all pretend not to hear me!"</p><p></p><p>The Lishui King erupted in thunderous rage, "Eating the taxes of the common people, yet you are utterly useless! What use do I have for you? If that's the case, I might as well recruit new talented officials, and as for you, you might as well retire and return to your hometowns!"</p><p></p><p>Here is the full English translation of the Chinese excerpt:</p><p></p><p>The officials were all startled and promptly knelt down, collectively calling out, "Your Majesty, please calm your anger!"</p><p></p><p>At the same time, the officials kept glancing at Dong Ge, their meaning clear - "Dong Ge, you're the one who usually understands these things, so hurry up and say something!"</p><p></p><p>Dong Ge was at a complete loss, thinking, "Why me?" </p><p></p><p>Even if he did understand some of it, he didn't want to speak up.</p><p></p><p>Damn it, five years ago he had clearly made a contribution, but after the King returned to the capital, he still didn't get any promotion or raise in rank!</p><p></p><p>Back then, outside Moyu Town, he had just humbly mentioned it, and the King had actually taken it seriously! </p><p></p><p>How could he bear that?</p><p></p><p>"Hmm?" The King of Lishui precisely caught the officials' glances and turned his gaze to Dong Ge, his eyes flashing as he said, "Lord Dong, I've noticed that you've spoken very little these past five years."</p><p></p><p>Dong Ge trembled slightly and replied, "Your Majesty is overthinking, perhaps it's because I'm getting older and my mind has become duller."</p><p></p><p>The King of Lishui spoke calmly, "Lord Dong, if you can explain the reason for this mysterious withdrawal of the demonic beasts, I shall promote you by one rank on the spot."</p><p></p><p>Dong Ge abruptly stood up, staring intently at the King and asking, "Your Majesty, are you truly serious about this?"</p><p></p><p>The officials were stunned, thinking, "Wasn't he just saying his mind had become dull?"</p><p></p><p>"I do not jest," the King of Lishui said, his eyes gleaming.</p><p></p><p>Dong Ge inwardly laughed bitterly, thinking, "Of course you don't jest - you really didn't give me that promotion five years ago, just as you said."</p><p></p><p>Does he know how Dong Ge has been living these past five years? He's been resentful about that incident all along!</p><p></p><p>"Your Majesty, I believe this matter is related to the fleeting cry we heard that day!" Dong Ge said respectfully and seriously.</p><p></p><p>The officials were taken aback, realizing that was indeed a possibility. How could they have not thought of such a simple connection?</p><p></p><p>"Moreover, based on my intuition, that cry may even be related to the Immortal," Dong Ge said reverently.</p><p></p><p>Soon, Dong Ge noticed the officials' confusion, so he quickly waved his hand, saying, "Don't look at me, I'm just going by my intuition."</p><p></p><p>"Ah, Your Majesty, if the withdrawal of the demonic beasts is only related to that cry, does that mean they could attack us at any time? Should we relocate to Moyu Town?" an official asked.</p><p></p><p>The King of Lishui waved his hand, "Even if just the eastern part of the Empire were to relocate to Moyu, that would still be manageable. But the southern, western, and northern regions - the distance is too far, the population too large, and Moyu Town's surroundings would not have enough space. And furthermore..."</p><p></p><p>Dong Ge picked up the thread, "And furthermore, Your Majesty must be thinking that the Immortal may have long since left Moyu Town by now. Even if we relocate there, it would be useless."</p><p></p><p>The King of Lishui looked at Dong Ge approvingly, "Excellent, Lord Dong's words are entirely correct."</p><p></p><p>"But what are we to do?!" the officials exclaimed anxiously.</p><p></p><p>"Esteemed Lords, do not worry. The Immortals of the Azure Cloud Sect have already made preparations for this situation, so we need only cooperate with them," the King of Lishui said solemnly.</p><p></p><p>The officials nodded.</p><p></p><p>Dong Ge noticed the King seemed to have forgotten something, so he quickly said, "Your Majesty, have you forgotten something?"</p><p></p><p>"What?" the King of Lishui asked, puzzled.</p><p></p><p>"Pfft!" </p><p></p><p>Dong Ge suddenly coughed up three mouthfuls of blood, splattering several officials in the face.</p>

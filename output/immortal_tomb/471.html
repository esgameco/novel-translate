        <h1>Chapter 471</h1>
        <div class="content">
            <p>Here is the full English translation of the Chinese excerpt:</p><p></p><p>The boundless heavens and earth, the ancient and mysterious realm.</p><p></p><p>After Lü Changsheng had shattered Chu You, all the people present were so frightened that they bowed down to show their submission.</p><p></p><p>Lü Changsheng came to the top of the Heavenly Phenomenon Tower, slowly walked to the outside of the Extreme Refinement Formation, and then slapped the Extreme Refinement Formation, causing it to shatter into pieces. The complex patterns on the ground also immediately started smoking and then disappeared.</p><p></p><p>"M-Master..."</p><p></p><p>He Xitong called out reverently with her head bowed.</p><p></p><p>He Xitong knew that the Master must have recognized her.</p><p></p><p>She even had a guess that it was very likely that the Master had come to the Heavenly Realm to rescue her, entrusted by her father...</p><p></p><p>Lü Changsheng looked at He Xitong for a moment and nodded faintly, "Xing Tian is very worried about you."</p><p></p><p>He Xitong's heart trembled, and she inwardly thought that it was indeed her father...</p><p></p><p>Fortunately, her father knew the Master, and the Master had become her father's only lifeline, otherwise her father would have been utterly desperate.</p><p></p><p>Meanwhile, He Yansi, who had heard the conversation, had a ghastly pale face!</p><p></p><p>Not only him, even He Lian and Ye Zhuiyue and the others also had a slight change in their expressions.</p><p></p><p>Ye Zhuiyue and the others finally realized that the private matter Lü Changsheng had mentioned was actually this.</p><p></p><p>Ye Zhuiyue recalled what Lü Changsheng had previously said to him about resolving the He Clan, and his heart was filled with bitterness.</p><p></p><p>How ridiculous that he didn't believe it at the time, and the reality had slapped him hard in the face.</p><p></p><p>For Elder Lü, or rather, Lord Lü, what was the He Clan worth? Even the powerful Black-Robed Man was easily manipulated by him, and even the Heavenly Dao, Lord Lü could kill as he pleased.</p><p></p><p>As for He Lian, she staggered, her eyes vacant, and her heart filled with despair!</p><p></p><p>She had thought that with the Black-Robed Man destroyed, the He Clan had miraculously escaped disaster, but who would have known that this powerful young man in blue was actually here to rescue He Xitong?</p><p></p><p>How could He Xitong know such a powerful figure?</p><p></p><p>If only she had known earlier, the He Clan would never have dared to do anything to offend him!!</p><p></p><p>At this moment, an inexplicable anger towards He Xitong arose in He Lian's heart.</p><p></p><p>She dared not be angry at Lü Changsheng, not even in her heart, so she could only unconsciously transfer the anger to He Xitong.</p><p></p><p>Ouyang Mo and the others, who had initially stood on the side of the He Clan, were now terrified.</p><p></p><p>Hong Wanjun and the others looked at He Lian with pity...</p><p></p><p>If there were no unexpected events, the He Clan was doomed.</p><p></p><p>As for the Ouyang Clan and the others, it was hard to say.</p><p></p><p>Suddenly, Hong Wanjun thought of something and looked sharply at Hong Wuji, and the regretful Hong Wuji also noticed his ancestor's gaze.</p><p></p><p>So, Hong Wuji's eyes pleaded with Hong Wanjun, hoping that he would help him plead for mercy later.</p><p></p><p>Hong Wanjun looked at him disappointedly and then averted his gaze.</p><p></p><p>Faced with that young man in blue, what qualifications did the humble Hong Wanjun have to plead for mercy? It would not be worth it to get himself involved in the end.</p><p></p><p>Helpless, Hong Wuji could only resign himself to death, after all, his ancestor was still there, and he could always appoint a new clan leader.</p><p></p><p>...</p><p></p><p>Lü Changsheng looked at He Xitong and smiled, "Do you still have any attachment to the He Clan?"</p><p></p><p>Lü Changsheng's sudden words made He Xitong pause for a moment. She quickly realized that if she answered that she had no attachment, then according to the Master's style, he would probably wipe out the entire He Clan...</p><p></p><p>He Xitong was silent for a moment, "Master, my mother is still in the Soul-Devouring Abyss of the He Clan."</p><p></p><p>Lü Changsheng nodded lightly, and then closed his eyes to sense something. He then waved his sleeve, and a thin and emaciated woman suddenly appeared out of thin air.</p><p></p><p>"Is this your mother?"</p><p></p><p>He Xitong stared blankly at this unbelievable scene, and then quickly rushed forward, supporting the fallen He Tianjun with tears in her eyes, "Mother..."</p><p></p><p>Here is the full English translation of the Chinese excerpt:</p><p></p><p>Jun's eyelids fluttered, and she slowly opened her eyes, immediately seeing the close-up of He Xitong. She was stunned.</p><p></p><p>The next moment, He Tianjun embraced He Xitong and cried out, "Xitong, my little Xitong, wuwu... This is not a dream."</p><p></p><p>Although He Tianjun had not seen He Xitong for a very long time, and her image of Xitong was from when she was very young, she instantly recognized her - this was Xitong, this was her own flesh and blood.</p><p></p><p>Tears glistened in the corners of He Xitong's eyes as she gently patted He Tianjun's back, comforting her emotions: "Mother, it's Xitong... This is real."</p><p></p><p>"Xitong, mother is sorry for you......"</p><p></p><p>Before He Tianjun could finish, she fainted due to her emotions being too intense, as she was originally extremely weak.</p><p></p><p>"Mother, you have not wronged Xitong......" As He Xitong spoke, she suddenly panicked when she found her mother's breath growing weaker and weaker, even faintly sensing...</p><p></p><p>"Mother! Mother!" He Xitong was immediately at a loss.</p><p></p><p>Beside them, Lu Changsheng calmly said, "Your mother has been clinging to life all this time because of the obsession in her heart. Now that she has seen you, her wish has been fulfilled, and that breath has been released."</p><p></p><p>He Xitong instantly understood what Lu Changsheng meant - it meant that her mother's life had completely reached its end after seeing her!</p><p></p><p>"Sir! Sir! Is there no way......" </p><p></p><p>He Xitong looked at Lu Changsheng pleadingly, her eyes red and utterly helpless.</p><p></p><p>She did not want her mother to just pass away right after they had reunited. And her father was still in the Ancestral Heavenly Realm, he had not even seen her mother yet...</p><p></p><p>"I have no way." </p><p></p><p>Lu Changsheng said calmly, his eyes unperturbed.</p><p></p><p>The life and death of He Xitong's mother had no karmic connection with Lu Changsheng, so he could not possibly revive her like he did with Han Jinlong on the battlefield of gods and demons.</p><p></p><p>If it was someone related to Lu Changsheng, whose life had reached its end, Lu Changsheng would use his supreme techniques to revive them. But to do that for anyone else would be chaotic.</p><p></p><p>On a larger scale, it would disrupt the order. On a smaller scale, it would be unfair to everyone else.</p><p></p><p>Somehow, Lu Changsheng absolutely did not allow the order of the world to be disrupted - that was not what he wanted to see.</p><p></p><p>"Sir, it was Xitong's momentary impatience and unreasonableness..."</p><p></p><p>He Xitong apologized, then lowered her head, looking at her mother whose breath was now extremely weak, her shoulders trembling.</p><p></p><p>Suddenly, Lu Changsheng thought of Xing Tian, that middle-aged man who had been waiting so painfully in the Ancestral Heavenly Realm, and sighed, saying:</p><p></p><p>"Xitong, I can help your mother extend her life for a period of time to go to the Ancestral Heavenly Realm, so that your father can see your mother one last time, how about that?"</p><p></p><p>He Xitong's nose stung, and she bowed to Lu Changsheng while holding the weakly breathing He Tianjun, "Xitong thanks... the sir for his great kindness."</p><p></p><p>Lu Changsheng nodded slightly, then looked at He Tianjun and softly said, "Wake up."</p><p></p><p>What happened next was a miraculous sight - the originally dying He Tianjun suddenly opened her eyes as if returning from the brink, her complexion gradually becoming ruddy and full, her entire aura reaching its former peak.</p><p></p><p>The elder of the He Clan beside them was already dumbfounded, and Lu Changsheng had become even more terrifying in his eyes.</p><p></p><p>Those who didn't know would never have guessed that this woman had been on the verge of death just a moment ago.</p>

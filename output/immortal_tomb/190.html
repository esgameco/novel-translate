        <h1>Chapter 190</h1>
        <div class="content">
            <p>Here is the full English translation of the Chinese excerpt:</p><p></p><p>Along the way, </p><p></p><p>Cai Xu and Huang Bin saw the disciples passing by one by one greeting Tong Xin, and they were envious while also understanding that this senior Tong Xin must be an extraordinary disciple, even though he is a disciple.</p><p></p><p>At this time, a beautiful white-haired lady came towards them, and Cai Xu and Huang Bin's eyes were dazzled, and their mouths were drooling.</p><p></p><p>They didn't expect that there would be such a good-looking senior sister in the Xiaoyao Sect.</p><p></p><p>Left Qizhan saluted Tong Xin, then glanced at Cai Xu and Huang Bin, and asked puzzledly, "Senior Brother Tong, when did we start recruiting disciples?"</p><p></p><p>Tong Xin smiled and said, "Not yet, I see that these two are talents, so I'm taking them to get familiar with our Xiaoyao Sect in advance."</p><p></p><p>Left Qizhan was slightly surprised, and looked Cai Xu and Huang Bin up and down.</p><p></p><p>Seeing this, Cai Xu and Huang Bin were delighted, and quickly raised their heads and chests, wanting to show Left Qizhan their most vigorous spirit.</p><p></p><p>But Left Qizhan snorted and left after saluting Tong Xin.</p><p></p><p>The two of them were immediately dejected, but their desire to join the Xiaoyao Sect became even stronger!</p><p></p><p>"Haha, you two better not have any bad intentions towards Senior Sister Qizhan, her little purple can eat people." Tong Xin laughed.</p><p></p><p>Although he looked a little younger, he was actually quite mature and knew everything.</p><p></p><p>The white-haired senior sister just now was called Qizhan?</p><p></p><p>Cai Xu and Huang Bin immediately remembered this name.</p><p></p><p>"Let's go, I'll take you two directly to the Registration Hall," Tong Xin waved his hand and led the way.</p><p></p><p>Cai Xu and Huang Bin were overjoyed, they didn't expect to become disciples of the Xiaoyao Sect so easily!</p><p></p><p>Could it be that the threshold for recruiting disciples in the Xiaoyao Sect is very low?</p><p></p><p>Or were they just lucky?</p><p></p><p>"Senior Brother Tong, who is the sect master of our sect?" Huang Bin asked respectfully.</p><p></p><p>Tong Xin suddenly stopped in his tracks, turned his head and sternly said, "Don't ask what you shouldn't!"</p><p></p><p>Cai Xu and Huang Bin were startled and quickly knelt down.</p><p></p><p>They didn't understand why the gentle Senior Brother Tong had suddenly become so fierce.</p><p></p><p>"I tell you, with your mere Tribulation Transcendence realm, even if you join my Xiaoyao Sect, you will only start as a menial disciple. Don't forget your status!"</p><p></p><p>"The executives and elders of my Xiaoyao Sect don't dare to openly discuss the sect master, how dare you?"</p><p></p><p>Tong Xin said coldly.</p><p></p><p>Cai Xu and Huang Bin trembled in their hearts, stammering, "Senior Brother Tong, we know we were wrong."</p><p></p><p>"Don't do it again, get up."</p><p></p><p>Tong Xin's expression softened a bit, and he gently raised his hand to lift the two of them up.</p><p></p><p>After that, Cai Xu and Huang Bin didn't dare to talk nonsense anymore, they knew they had been too presumptuous before.</p><p></p><p>Soon, Tong Xin led them to the Registration Hall.</p><p></p><p>The originally comfortably dozing Yin Jiudui, who was sitting there, opened his eyes in surprise when he saw Cai Xu and Huang Bin, and smiled, "Hey, Tong Xin, why do you have time to come to my Registration Hall today?"</p><p></p><p>Tong Xin smiled and saluted, "Elder, I've brought these two to register."</p><p></p><p>He then said, "Why are you personally here? Letting the other disciples handle the registration would be fine."</p><p></p><p>Yin Jiudui stood up and pointed to Tong Xin, laughing, "Our Xiaoyao Sect is about to start recruiting disciples, so in the initial stage I naturally have to pay more attention, otherwise if the Fifth Elder reports it to the Grand Elder, won't I be in trouble?"</p><p></p><p>"Haha," Tong Xin chuckled.</p><p></p><p>He naturally knew who the Fifth Elder and Grand Elder Yin Jiudui mentioned were.</p><p></p><p>Currently in the Xiaoyao Sect, the elders are Grand Elder Peng Fang, Second Elder Left Qiushan, Third Elder Su Qianghe, Fourth Elder Yin Jiudui, and Fifth Elder Zhao Wuyou.</p><p></p><p>Here is the full English translation of the Chinese excerpt:</p><p></p><p>At that time, there was often friction between Yin Jiuguai and Zhao Wuyou, as they looked at each other with distaste, a habit that had continued from the Qingxuan Town to the present day...</p><p></p><p>As for the group of immortal kings and Mixuan immortal lords who were once under their respective powers, they now all serve as protectors, attendants, and other roles within the Xiaoyao Sect.</p><p></p><p>At this moment, Cai Xu and Huang Bin, who were maintaining a bowing posture, had become dumbfounded.</p><p></p><p>They did not expect the thin old man in front of them to be the Fourth Elder of the Xiaoyao Sect!</p><p></p><p>Moreover, the Fourth Elder in front of them seemed unfathomable in their eyes, like a deep abyss.</p><p></p><p>Yin Jiuguai glanced at Cai Xu and Huang Bin, then frowned and said bluntly, "You two are at the peak of Tribulation Transcendence... your talent is also mediocre. Tongxin, with such abilities, you would have great difficulty even entering the outer sect, let alone becoming a servant."</p><p></p><p>Even though these two cultivators were brought by Tongxin, Yin Jiuguai spoke frankly.</p><p></p><p>Tongxin smiled slightly, "Elder, these two are talents."</p><p></p><p>"Alright, since you say they are talents, then they must be talents." Yin Jiuguai's brow finally relaxed.</p><p></p><p>Thereafter, Yin Jiuguai handed the earthy-yellow servant's uniform, a servant disciple token, and a handbook to Cai Xu and Huang Bin.</p><p></p><p>He then said indifferently, "The details regarding the treatment and other matters are all in the handbook. You can read it carefully later."</p><p></p><p>"Yes, yes, yes." Cai Xu and Huang Bin bowed deeply, not even daring to raise their heads.</p><p></p><p>"Let me tell you, don't think that just because you are servant disciples, you are somehow inferior. In our Xiaoyao Sect, even the servant disciples are more noble than the outer or inner sect disciples of the so-called Nine Rank Sects, and their treatment is also better!" </p><p></p><p>After Yin Jiuguai spoke indifferently, he smiled at Tongxin and then returned to his seat.</p><p></p><p>Tongxin smiled and said, "Elder, then Tongxin will take them and leave first."</p><p></p><p>"Hehe, Tongxin, come and chat with me when you have time. I'm a bit bored here." Yin Jiuguai nodded slightly.</p><p></p><p>Indeed, within the sect, only Tongxin and Lin Dong could casually converse with these elders, as the other disciples were too respectful to approach them.</p><p></p><p>"Understood."</p><p></p><p>Tongxin chuckled and led the trembling Cai Xu and Huang Bin away.</p><p></p><p>...</p><p></p><p>At the Servant Peak.</p><p></p><p>After Tongxin brought Cai Xu and Huang Bin there, he smiled and said, "Alright, you two can stay here at the Servant Peak for now. Diligently cultivate and strive to advance to the outer sect as soon as possible. Your senior brother still has high hopes for you."</p><p></p><p>Just as Tongxin was about to leave, Cai Xu suddenly said respectfully, "Senior Brother Tongxin, can Abin and I go back to Feiyun City for a visit? We'll return tomorrow."</p><p></p><p>Huang Bin's eyes also lit up at these words. Indeed, it was too abrupt, and they wanted to go back and inform their families, and say their goodbyes.</p><p></p><p>"Okay, then you can go back and say your goodbyes. If the gatekeeper disciple asks, just tell them I said it was fine." Tongxin nodded and then disappeared.</p><p></p><p>"Respectfully seeing off Senior Brother Tongxin."</p><p></p><p>Cai Xu and Huang Bin were delighted, quickly paying their respects.</p><p></p><p>"Wow, little black, the Xiaoyao Sect is really special. Even the Servant Peak has such status," Huang Bin exclaimed as he looked around in amazement.</p><p></p><p>"That's right?" Cai Xu smiled proudly, then his expression became pensive. "Abin, do you still remember what the Fourth Elder said? He actually said that even for us at the peak of Tribulation Transcendence, it would be difficult for us to become even servants, and that the servant disciples of the Xiaoyao Sect are more noble than the outer or inner sect disciples of the Nine Rank Sects?"</p><p></p><p>Huang Bin pursed his lips, then transmitted a message, "Don't take the Fourth Elder's words too seriously. Servant disciples can't really be considered formal disciples."</p><p></p><p>Cai Xu frowned, then opened the handbook in his hand and started reading.</p><p></p><p>Soon, his eyes widened, and he sucked in a deep breath in shock!</p>

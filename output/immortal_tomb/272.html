        <h1>Chapter 272</h1>
        <div class="content">
            <p>Here is the full English translation of the Chinese excerpt:</p><p></p><p>Fu Shiyu snapped out of her daze, taking a step back with a weapon appearing in her hand. üêùüë§‚ùª‚ùæ≈û–Ωùìäœá.ÂåöœÉùìÇüéâüêü</p><p></p><p>Behind her, Fu Tao and the others also stood ready, their faces pale as if facing a formidable enemy!</p><p></p><p>The fact that these two people could appear silently behind them, without even Fu Shiyu noticing, was enough to say it all!</p><p></p><p>Stronger than them!</p><p></p><p>The eyes under Lu Changsheng's bronze mask flashed for a moment, and he said softly, "Don't be nervous, we have no ill intentions."</p><p></p><p>His voice was magnetic and as smooth as jade, and it was clear that he did not seem to have any malicious intent.</p><p></p><p>Hearing this, the group felt slightly relieved, but their defensive stance did not relax.</p><p></p><p>Fu Shiyu glanced at Li Shuyan, then her gaze fell on Lu Changsheng.</p><p></p><p>She made eye contact with the mysterious eyes behind the mask for a moment, then instinctively averted her gaze, holding her sword and cupping her hands: "Senior, may I ask..."</p><p></p><p>Lu Changsheng gently waved his hand to interrupt her, and smiled: "I want to go back to your world with you."</p><p></p><p>Fu Tao and the others were slightly taken aback, looking at the two people in front of them with a strange expression.</p><p></p><p>An outsider?</p><p></p><p>Fu Shiyu's eyes rippled, and she was a little conflicted in her heart, but after only a moment's hesitation, she nodded and agreed: "Okay."</p><p></p><p>In this situation, she could not afford to hesitate.</p><p></p><p>If she refused, she dared not guarantee what the mysterious man in blue would do.</p><p></p><p>After all... the strong killing the weak is too simple, and does not require too many reasons.</p><p></p><p>Fu Shiyu could see from the various details that the two people in front of them were not ordinary, especially the blue-robed man leading them...</p><p></p><p>...</p><p></p><p>In the void.</p><p></p><p>A celestial ship was speeding through the sky.</p><p></p><p>On the deck, Fu Tao and the others were vigilantly looking around the void, afraid that the Boundless Heavenly Dao would appear again.</p><p></p><p>At the same time, they were also observing the three figures standing at the railing in front of them, who seemed to be in conversation at the moment.</p><p></p><p>"Young Master, those two people shouldn't harm Miss Shiyu, right? If they do, we might not be able to stop them in time," one of the servants worried.</p><p></p><p>Fu Tao's face darkened, and he said impatiently, "You overestimate yourselves! Stop them? With what? Do you think my sister wants to go over there and be alone with those two people? It's not that she has no choice."</p><p></p><p>"Besides... don't worry, the young master has always been good at judging people. These two people really have no ill intentions."</p><p></p><p>The others dared not speak anymore.</p><p></p><p>...</p><p></p><p>Fu Shiyu's hand rested on the railing, her eyes seemingly gazing into the distance, but in reality, her peripheral vision was focused on the blue-robed figure beside her.</p><p></p><p>The palm of her hand resting on the railing was already covered in cold sweat.</p><p></p><p>It would be a lie to say that she was not nervous.</p><p></p><p>She couldn't help but feel that the oppressive aura of this mysterious blue-robed man was even stronger than her father's.</p><p></p><p>"What is the name of your world?" the blue-robed man suddenly asked.</p><p></p><p>Fu Shiyu's gaze sharpened, and she turned her body slightly, giving a salute before saying, "Senior, our world is called the Eternal Realm, the only great world in this void."</p><p></p><p>Hearing this, Li Shuyan's hand holding the sword in his embrace tightened involuntarily. The Eternal Realm... it sounded even more powerful than the Ancestral Heavenly Realm.</p><p></p><p>"The Eternal Realm..." Lu Changsheng murmured, a cold light flashing in his eyes.</p><p></p><p>His memories were gradually recovering, and there were some blurry figures in his mind, as well as a vague name - the Ancient Clans.</p><p></p><p>The five extinct Boundless Heavenly Dao had mentioned it before, and when he had silently appeared behind these people just now, he had also heard the term "Eight Great Ancient Clans", one of which was the Ancient Desolate Sword Clan...</p><p></p><p>"Tell me about the Eight Great Ancient Clans," Lu Changsheng said, looking at Fu Shiyu.</p><p></p><p>Fu Shiyu's expression changed, and she hesitated for a moment, not daring to speak.</p><p></p><p>They could discuss the Eight Great Ancient Clans casually among the Fu family, but in front of others...</p><p></p><p>Here is the full English translation of the Chinese excerpt:</p><p></p><p>In the vast Eternal Realm, the Eight Ancient Clans are like a taboo. </p><p></p><p>And she did not know what the mysterious azure-robed person in front of her was asking about the Eight Ancient Clans...</p><p></p><p>"Don't tell me you want me to search their souls?" Lu Changsheng chuckled.</p><p></p><p>Fu Shiyu's pupils contracted, she took a deep breath and replied with difficulty, "Senior, you jest. Truthfully, Shiyu knows very little about the Eight Ancient Clans..."</p><p></p><p>"Just say what you know." Lu Changsheng closed his eyes.</p><p></p><p>"Yes." Thinking of the Ancient Clans, a look of reverence appeared in Fu Shiyu's eyes as she began, "In the Eternal Realm, the Eight Ancient Clans..."</p><p></p><p>Quickly, Fu Shiyu finished recounting what she knew.</p><p></p><p>Li Shuyan was stunned, it seemed like she didn't say much.</p><p></p><p>Lu Changsheng pursed his lips slightly, from what Fu Shiyu said, the Eight Ancient Clans were the supreme overlords of the Eternal Realm, dividing this vast realm into eight parts, each ruling their own domain.</p><p></p><p>The rest...was a bit outrageous.</p><p></p><p>"Senior, the Eight Ancient Clans are extremely mysterious. We outsiders truly know very little, even in the Eternal Realm, apart from the Eight Ancient Clans themselves, no one knows their clan locations, but everyone knows the Eight Ancient Clans do exist."</p><p></p><p>"Aside from their clan names, we really know nothing else."</p><p></p><p>Fu Shiyu hurriedly explained, afraid that Lu Changsheng might misunderstand and think she was mocking him.</p><p></p><p>Lu Changsheng was silent for a moment, then asked, "Apart from the Ancient Desolate Sword Clan, what are the names of the other seven clans?"</p><p></p><p>Regarding Lu Changsheng's knowledge of the Ancient Desolate Sword Clan, Fu Shiyu was only puzzled for a moment before understanding, presumably he had learned of them from their previous discussions in the void.</p><p></p><p>Immediately, her delicate face became grave:</p><p></p><p>"The Crimson Flame Heavens - the Blazing Wolf Clan."</p><p>"The Moon Star Realm - the Ancient Moon Blood Clan."</p><p>"The Fallen Immortal Continent - the Jiang Clan Ancient Clan."</p><p>"The Ancient Desolate Ruins - the Ancient Desolate Sword Clan."</p><p>"The Chaotic Demon Sea Domain - the Heavenly Demon Clan."</p><p>"The Sacred Light Ancient Realm - the Ancient Saint Clan."</p><p>"The Endless Great Desert - the Nine-Winged Desert Beast Clan."</p><p>"The Heavenly Abyss Ancient Realm - the Void Ancient Beast King Clan."</p><p></p><p>Li Shuyan listened with a pounding heart, these clans, one more terrifying than the other!</p><p></p><p>When Lu Changsheng heard the last one, his brow raised slightly: "The Void Ancient Beast King Clan? Why the 'King' title?"</p><p></p><p>Hearing this, Fu Shiyu tucked a strand of hair behind her ear and solemnly replied, "Senior, it is rumored that among the Eight Ancient Clans, the Void Ancient Beast Clan ranks first, hence they are called the King Clan."</p><p></p><p>As she said this, Fu Shiyu's eyes grew horrified, and she continued with difficulty, "There are also rumors that the Void Ancient Beast King Clan feeds on the void itself, I don't know if it's true or not..."</p><p></p><p>It must be true, each of the Eight Ancient Clans has its own divine abilities and characteristics.</p><p></p><p>Otherwise, the Heavenly Dao would not be so wary of them.</p><p></p><p>Hiss, feeding on the void?</p><p></p><p>Li Shuyan silently took a deep breath, after leaving the Ancestral Heavenly Realm, he had truly gained new insights.</p><p></p><p>He could hardly imagine what kind of existence would be able to feed on the void itself.</p><p></p><p>Lu Changsheng nodded slightly, through this questioning, he had learned some information about the Eight Ancient Clans.</p><p></p><p>"Senior... Are you going to the Ancient Desolate Ruins with Shiyu?" Fu Shiyu asked hesitantly while bowing.</p><p></p><p>Although she was inwardly filled with doubt, she did not intend to ask Lu Changsheng why he was interested in the Eight Ancient Clans, as they were not close, and it would be impolite to pry.</p><p></p><p>However, Fu Shiyu guessed that this mysterious azure-robed person must have overheard their previous discussion about the Ancient Desolate Sword Clan and became curious.</p><p></p><p>Lu Changsheng gazed at the dazzling star ahead, and replied indifferently, "En, I'll come visit your place."</p><p></p><p>Fu Shiyu: "Ah?"</p><p></p><p>Li Shuyan immediately furrowed his brows and coldly said, "The Senior said he's going to your place, don't you understand?"</p><p></p><p>"I-I understand."</p>

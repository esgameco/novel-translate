        <h1>Chapter 25</h1>
        <div class="content">
            <p>Here is the full English translation of the Chinese excerpt:</p><p></p><p>Zhen Master's Mansion, Backyard.</p><p></p><p>Lu Changsheng glanced in the direction of the city wall. Just now, Gu Helin and Tongxin had already left.</p><p></p><p>He then withdrew his gaze and calmly inspected the Abyss Demon Spear that was floating three feet off the ground.</p><p></p><p>The Abyss Demon Spear was trembling incessantly. It was given a sense of terror by this young man in blue.</p><p></p><p>As a demonic treasure of the Abyss Demon King in the Demon Realm, it had long since gained sentience.</p><p></p><p>However, it had once drunk the fresh blood as vast as the sea, so even if it were to become a spirit in the future, it would be an evil spirit.</p><p></p><p>After all, that vast amount of fresh blood was mixed with endless resentment!</p><p></p><p>"This Emperor knows that you have already gained sentience and can understand human speech. You can rest assured and wait for your master to come save you," Lu Changsheng said softly.</p><p></p><p>Hearing this, the Abyss Demon Spear trembled even more violently!</p><p>For some reason, its subconscious did not believe that its master could rescue it.</p><p></p><p>"But if your master fails to rescue you... then he must die, and you must also be destroyed."</p><p></p><p>Lu Changsheng said indifferently.</p><p></p><p>The Abyss Demon Spear panicked, its spear body standing upright in the air, actually swaying frantically towards Lu Changsheng, looking very much like a person repeatedly bowing and begging for mercy.</p><p></p><p>"Stay here."</p><p></p><p>Lu Changsheng ignored this not-yet-formed evil spirit, got up and walked out of the pavilion, heading towards the room.</p><p></p><p>The night was already deep, it was time to rest.</p><p></p><p>As for this Abyss Demon Spear, he was too lazy to apply any seals or barriers, there was no need at all. If it dared to run, then let it run...</p><p></p><p>Soon, only the Abyss Demon Spear was left in the courtyard.</p><p>It hovered there quietly, daring not to move.</p><p></p><p>...</p><p></p><p>Demon Realm.</p><p></p><p>"What? The soul lamps of your clan leader and the four elders have all been extinguished?" </p><p></p><p>Zhao Shenyuan's pupils shrank, asking somewhat dazedly.</p><p></p><p>"Yes... yes, Your Majesty the Demon King, not only the clan leader and the four elders, but dozens of our clan members' soul lamps have been extinguished as well!" </p><p></p><p>The Black Tongue Demon Tribe elder knelt on the ground, trembling as he spoke.</p><p></p><p>He was now the only remaining elder-level figure in the Black Tongue Demon Tribe.</p><p></p><p>When the clansmen in charge of guarding the soul lamps came to report, he initially did not believe it. But when he went to check it himself, he immediately felt dizzy.</p><p></p><p>At the same time, he was also extremely relieved, as he had some matters to attend to and did not follow the clan leader to the Spiritual Dust Realm.</p><p></p><p>Otherwise, his old life would have been lost as well.</p><p></p><p>"Damn it!"</p><p></p><p>Zhao Shenyuan's expression became unsettled.</p><p></p><p>It was not that he cared about the Black Tongue Demon Tribe, let them die if they must.</p><p></p><p>He was worried about his Abyss Demon Spear!</p><p></p><p>For the sake of the Abyss Demon Spear, he had invested a lot of effort and energy.</p><p></p><p>What exactly happened to the Black Tongue Demon Tribe in that secular world? </p><p></p><p>A group that was comparable to late-stage Cinnabar Elixir Cultivators, four that were comparable to early-stage Cinnabar Elixir Cultivators, yet they were all annihilated.</p><p></p><p>"You Black Tongue Demon Tribe are truly incompetent, get out of here and let the Nightmare Demon Tribe come see this King."</p><p></p><p>Zhao Shenyuan said coldly.</p><p></p><p>"Yes... yes."</p><p></p><p>The Black Tongue Demon Tribe elder felt as if he had been granted amnesty, and simply scurried out.</p><p></p><p>Zhao Shenyuan muttered icily,</p><p></p><p>"Better not dare to try and refine this King's Abyss Demon Spear, or else this King, no matter who you are, will make sure your soul is shattered."</p><p></p><p>The last sentence was almost spat out through gritted teeth.</p><p></p><p>...</p><p></p><p>A few days later.</p><p></p><p>Gu Helin and Tongxin hurried back to Qingyun Sect.</p><p></p><p>In the Qingyun Sect's main hall, over a dozen figures stood on both sides, all of them were the sect's high-level members, with furrowed brows.</p><p></p><p>The atmosphere in the entire space was unusually gloomy.</p><p></p><p>"Elder Gu, it is not that our sect does not trust you, but this matter is of such great significance that you must surely be aware of it," </p><p></p><p>A cold voice sounded from above the hall.</p><p></p><p>Immediately, all the elders looked towards Gu Helin. Although they basically believed him, this matter was so huge, it concerned the entire Spiritual Dust Cultivation World!</p><p></p><p>Gu Helin pursed his lips and bowed, "Sect Master, Elder Gu would certainly not joke about such an earth-shattering event. If the Sect Master still has doubts, Elder Gu is willing to..."</p><p></p><p>Here is the full English translation of the Chinese excerpt:</p><p></p><p>The air in the grand hall suddenly tensed up.</p><p></p><p>The expressions of the elders instantly became extremely grave.</p><p></p><p>They had completely believed it.</p><p></p><p>Finally, they all looked towards the figure in the seat, waiting for their words.</p><p></p><p>Shen Miaoyun's (yun) brows were slightly furrowed as she faintly said, "Elder Gu has spoken too seriously."</p><p></p><p>After saying this, there was no further conversation.</p><p></p><p>The grand hall fell into a long silence, and the elders also frowned and pondered deeply.</p><p></p><p>"Elder Gu, please explain in detail," Shen Miaoyun said softly with her eyes closed.</p><p></p><p>"Yes." Elder Gu Helin responded, then spoke in a solemn voice, "Previously, people from the secular Lishui Emperor's Kingdom came to seek help, saying there was a demonic disturbance. At that time, the sect master and the other elders were all away, and only Elder Gu and the mountain guardian elder were left in the sect. Elder Gu then sent his personally trained disciple Tongxin along with some outer sect disciples..."</p><p></p><p>Afterwards, Gu Helin went on to narrate the course of events and his inferences to the crowd.</p><p></p><p>The people were listening attentively at first, but when Gu Helin mentioned...</p><p></p><p>"What? The Abyss Demon Spear!!"</p><p></p><p>The elders exclaimed in shock!</p><p></p><p>Even Shen Miaoyun's eyes narrowed...</p><p></p><p>They had all heard of it before - it was the demonic treasure of the Abyss Demon King.</p><p></p><p>Gu Helin's eyes reflected the scene of that day as he sighed, "That's right, the Abyss Demon Spear. Even though it was wielded by four fifth-rank demons and one seventh-rank demon, Elder Gu's Thousand Sword Technique was instantly dispersed and suffered backlash."</p><p></p><p>"Then what happened?" Shen Miaoyun asked softly.</p><p></p><p>The elders were also shocked, looking at Gu Helin, not understanding how he managed to block it with his peak Jindan cultivation, and that too after suffering backlash.</p><p></p><p>Gu Helin smiled bitterly, silently apologizing to his senior, "Forgive me, I have to expose you now."</p><p></p><p>He could only reluctantly reveal the existence of Lu Changsheng, as he had no other way to explain it. Even if he lied, the people were staring at him waiting for an answer, and he couldn't come up with an excuse in the short time...</p><p></p><p>"What? Stopped the Abyss Demon Spear? Instantly slew the Demon Tribe Elder with an unseen technique?" </p><p></p><p>This must be at least an Ancestor in the Yuanying stage, right?</p><p></p><p>The elders looked at each other in astonishment, unable to hold back their profanity, their expressions extremely shocked, feeling like they were listening to a story.</p><p></p><p>But why would an Ancestor in the Yuanying stage appear in that secular place? Could it be that he came from elsewhere, went to that immortal tomb for enlightenment, and happened to arrive there?</p><p></p><p>At this time, the seated Shen Miaoyun slowly stood up, her eyes also containing shock, and asked, "Do you know the name and whereabouts of this cultivator?"</p><p></p><p>Gu Helin hesitated for a moment, then solemnly said, "The senior's surname is Lu, and his name is Changsheng."</p><p></p><p>"Lu... Changsheng."</p><p></p><p>Shen Miaoyun furrowed her brows and murmured softly, then said, "I've never heard of him. Could he be from another realm?"</p><p></p><p>Gu Helin replied, "Sect Master, the senior only said he was previously in seclusion. So... Elder Gu is not very clear about it."</p><p></p><p>Shen Miaoyun nodded, then asked again, "You haven't said where he is now?"</p><p></p><p>Hearing this, the attentive elders also turned to look at Gu Helin.</p><p></p><p>Gu Helin smiled bitterly and sighed, "Sect Master, Elders, the senior does not like to be disturbed..."</p><p></p><p>The people's eyes lit up!</p><p></p><p>Gu Helin obviously knew where he was!</p><p></p><p>"Haha, Helin, just tell us directly. Don't worry, since you've said so, we naturally won't go disturb that senior!"</p><p></p><p>The Grand Elder stepped forward and said with a smile.</p><p></p><p>The other elders also nodded in agreement.</p><p></p><p>Shen Miaoyun also really wanted to know, because according to what Gu Helin said, the world should be about to descend into chaos.</p><p></p><p>At this time, they urgently needed a powerful cultivator to take a stand!</p><p></p><p>Gu Helin silently apologized to Lu Changsheng again, knowing that the sect members would eventually go to Moyu Town, and everyone there knew Lu Changsheng was in Moyu Town...</p><p></p><p>He had no room to lie.</p><p></p><p>Afterwards, Gu Helin looked at the slightly impatient Shen Miaoyun and said,</p><p></p><p>"The senior is in Moyu Town."</p>

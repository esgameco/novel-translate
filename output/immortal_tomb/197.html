        <h1>Chapter 197</h1>
        <div class="content">
            <p>Here is my translation of the Chinese excerpt:</p><p></p><p>"I will obey the order of the Patriarch!" </p><p></p><p>A moment of silence fell over the training grounds, then a unified roar erupted. </p><p></p><p>The vast majority here had followed Lu Changsheng from Qingxuan Town to this Linglang Sky. </p><p></p><p>They naturally had complete faith in what Lu Changsheng said!</p><p></p><p>Not a shred of doubt!</p><p></p><p>Their Patriarch, the Fujiang Clan, had defeated the Zhanshi Clan - they were undisputedly the mightiest of that era!</p><p></p><p>Although they were now in this Linglang Sky, they did not dare claim their Patriarch could do this or that, but at the very least... they could stand up to a Rank 1 sect, that was certain!</p><p></p><p>But Cai Xu and the other newly promoted disciples were now covered in goosebumps, their minds buzzing...</p><p></p><p>It was as if their minds had been struck by a massive hammer, leaving them disoriented.</p><p></p><p>Whenever they realized their sect was no ordinary one, they would then discover they had severely underestimated it!</p><p></p><p>Hearing the Patriarch's previous words, they were actually going to compete above their rank in the Grand Competition of the Myriad Sects!!</p><p></p><p>And they were intending to go up against Rank 1 sects...</p><p></p><p>This... was too terrifying!</p><p></p><p>What kind of divine sect had they joined?!</p><p></p><p>Why would such a top-tier sect appear in the mortal realm of Canglang Zhou?</p><p></p><p>"Mm." </p><p></p><p>Lu Changsheng nodded slightly.</p><p></p><p>After a moment, </p><p></p><p>seeing no more voices coming, Elder Peng and the other four elders couldn't help but look up, seeing the figure in blue robes had disappeared from the high platform. They let out a sigh of relief and slowly rose to their feet.</p><p></p><p>The five turned to look at the thousands of kneeling figures.</p><p></p><p>Peng, positioned in the middle, said, "You may all rise."</p><p></p><p>"Yes."</p><p></p><p>Hearing this, everyone knew the Patriarch had left, and the tension in their hearts immediately eased. They then rose up in a grand manner, standing solemnly.</p><p></p><p>Peng, hands behind his back and belly protruding, took a step forward, sweeping his gaze over the crowd, and said calmly,</p><p></p><p>"The Patriarch's words, all of you must remember - since the Patriarch intends to compete for a ranking, the implicit meaning is that we, in this Grand Competition of the Myriad Sects... must strive for the first place!"</p><p></p><p>The crowd was shaken, especially the newly promoted disciples who were still bewildered.</p><p></p><p>"You heard correctly, the first place! Not just the first of the Ninth Rank, or the first of the Eighth Rank... but the number one sect of the Linglang Sky!!" Peng said again, his voice rising slightly.</p><p></p><p>This statement not only shocked the disoriented new disciples,</p><p></p><p>but even the rest were trembling inwardly, their breathing quickening.</p><p></p><p>To become the number one sect of the Linglang Sky, what a concept that was...</p><p></p><p>That meant not only going up against Rank 1 sects, but defeating them! Winning over all nine Rank 1 sects!</p><p></p><p>It sounded utterly insane.</p><p></p><p>It was true that they had an extremely powerful Patriarch as their backing, but the Patriarch would not interfere in the competition.</p><p></p><p>When the time came, they would have to face the mighty elders, executives, and top geniuses of those Rank 1 sects on their own.</p><p></p><p>While their overall strength was not weak, going up against the elders and disciples of Rank 1 sects... might not be so simple!</p><p></p><p>After the Grand Elder had deciphered the implicit meaning behind the Patriarch's words, the pressure on them had increased a thousandfold!</p><p></p><p>"Hehe, Second Elder, you say a few words," Peng suddenly stepped back, looking at the figure beside him, Left Qiushan, with a smile.</p><p></p><p>Left Qiushan paused for a moment, then responded with a raised voice, his gaze sweeping over Luo Qizhan, Zhu Xingqiu, and the others.</p><p></p><p>"In this Grand Competition of the Myriad Sects, it will undoubtedly be extremely brutal. Among you, there will certainly be those who die!"</p><p></p><p>"Whether it's your own personal growth, or the cohesion and sense of belonging of an entire sect, it is not about how many spirit stones are distributed each month, or what kind of treatment you receive monthly. It is about life-and-death battles, fighting as one sect!"</p><p></p><p>Here is the full English translation of the Chinese excerpt:</p><p></p><p>"We of the Carefree Sect have not been established for long. Whether you were here from the beginning or joined later, I believe that most of you still do not have a strong sense of belonging or collective pride for the Carefree Sect. You do not need to deny this, for it is the truth!"</p><p></p><p>"So... this Grand Competition among all the sects is the best opportunity!"</p><p></p><p>"As for our Sect Master, except for the newer disciples, I'm sure everyone knows of his greatness. In this Grand Competition, rest assured that when we face injustice or bullying, the Sect Master will be our strongest backing!"</p><p></p><p>"But aside from that, we must rely on ourselves!"</p><p></p><p>"Lastly, this elder wishes to say one thing - when we have gone through life and death together, when we have weathered hardships together, when the Carefree Sect finally claims the championship crown, and when the name of our sect resounds throughout the heavens, I believe... you will all share in our glory!!"</p><p></p><p>After Zuo Choushan finished speaking, he let out a sigh and loosened his fist, which he had unconsciously clenched.</p><p></p><p>The next moment, thunderous applause erupted on the training field! </p><p></p><p>Whether they were elders and administrators, or the disciples, all had eyes glistening and hearts swelling with emotion. </p><p></p><p>They felt ready to die for the sake of the sect.</p><p></p><p>Peng Fang nodded in satisfaction, knowing that Zuo Choushan was the right person to give this kind of speech.</p><p></p><p>The applause on the training field lasted for quite a while before finally subsiding. </p><p></p><p>Peng Fang then turned to look at Tong Xin and Lin Dong beside him, and said warmly, "You two Holy Scions, would you like to say a few words as well?"</p><p></p><p>At this, countless gazes turned towards Tong Xin and Lin Dong.</p><p></p><p>Tong Xin and Lin Dong felt a little flustered, but in the end, it was Lin Dong who stepped forward with a resolute gaze.</p><p></p><p>Amid the myriad of eyes upon him, he paused for a moment, then looked up and said with a smile,</p><p></p><p>"To be honest, my brother Tong Xin and I do not possess the strength to truly deserve the title of Holy Scion."</p><p></p><p>The crowd fell silent.</p><p></p><p>But Lin Dong continued, "What does it mean to be a Holy Scion? It means being a beacon of hope, a pillar of responsibility, and the mightiest warrior among all the disciples of our sect!"</p><p></p><p>"But our current abilities are still not enough to fulfill this role."</p><p></p><p>"Since the founding of our sect, my brother and I have always felt a sense of inadequacy and immense pressure."</p><p></p><p>At this point, Lin Dong took a deep breath, his eyes burning with determination.</p><p></p><p>He then spoke loudly, "However, I am not saying this to shirk our responsibilities, but to make a declaration!"</p><p></p><p>"My brother and I have cultivated for over a thousand years, and have already reached the Ninth Realm of the Golden Immortal. We will cultivate with ten times, a hundred times, a thousand times more diligence! In the upcoming Grand Competition, we, as the Holy Scions, will be at the forefront, protecting all our fellow disciples!"</p><p></p><p>Immediately, the training field erupted in thunderous applause once more. Many disciples looked at Lin Dong and Tong Xin with awe and reverence!</p><p></p><p>It was not just their heartwarming words, but also the fact that they had cultivated for over a thousand years and reached the Ninth Realm of the Golden Immortal.</p><p></p><p>Although their strength was still slightly lacking, their exceptional character and monstrous talent were more than enough to fulfill the role of Holy Scions!</p><p></p><p>Especially for the newer disciples like Cai Xu and Huang Bin, they were completely dumbfounded!</p><p></p><p>Even the Ninth Realm of the Golden Immortal was not enough to be worthy of the Holy Scion position? That meant... many of the senior disciples here must be at the Great Dao Golden Immortal realm?</p><p></p><p>Whew! Thinking it through, what realms must the respected elders and the mysterious Sect Master be at?</p><p></p><p>It was simply mind-boggling!</p><p></p><p>All the events that had just transpired finally made sense to them, leaving them utterly shocked and incredulous.</p><p></p><p>Meanwhile, Tong Xin felt a little embarrassed as he scratched his head. </p><p></p><p>He and his sworn brother knew full well that their monstrous talents were all thanks to the mysterious soup that their teacher had been making them drink every few days back in the Qingxuan Town's Longevity Tavern.</p>

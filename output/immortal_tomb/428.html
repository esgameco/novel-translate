        <h1>Chapter 428</h1>
        <div class="content">
            <p>Here is the full English translation of the Chinese excerpt:</p><p></p><p>In the grand hall, the officials trembled with fear as they heard the furious roar of Yunze Cang. They could only bow their heads in silence.</p><p></p><p>Facing the now powerful ancient kingdom of Fenglan, they were utterly helpless. </p><p></p><p>Against such overwhelming strength, any strategy would be easily crushed.</p><p></p><p>Ye Xunmao looked at the enraged Yunze Cang and cautiously asked, "Your Majesty, has the ancient kingdom of Fenglan given a deadline?"</p><p></p><p>Yunze Cang pursed his lips, his voice slightly softening as he replied, "You guessed correctly, my wise brother. Fenglan has issued an ultimatum, demanding that we make a decision within a mere month..."</p><p></p><p>A month? </p><p></p><p>Ye Xunmao's eyes flashed, realizing that the timeframe was indeed too rushed.</p><p></p><p>Yunze Cang paused for a moment, then solemnly said, "Brother, can you perhaps help me this time?"</p><p></p><p>Hearing this, Ye Xunmao's expression stiffened slightly as he sighed, "Your Majesty, you know that I have long since severed ties with my family..."</p><p></p><p>This was the reason Yunze Cang had immediately thought of Ye Xunmao after the incident.</p><p></p><p>Because Ye Xunmao was no ordinary person either. </p><p></p><p>Ye Xunmao hailed from an ancient family in the Qiankun Heavens, but had broken away from them in his earlier years due to certain circumstances. It was by chance that he came to the ancient kingdom of Yunlan and befriended Yunze Cang, becoming his sworn brother.</p><p></p><p>"Moreover, a month's time is far too short. Even if I could contact my family, I'm afraid it would be too late," Ye Xunmao continued with a sigh.</p><p></p><p>Thinking of his family, a look of sadness and regret appeared in Ye Xunmao's eyes.</p><p></p><p>To be honest, if he had not severed ties with his family back then, how could he have merely reached the peak of the Divine Warrior realm now?</p><p></p><p>With the terrifying resources of his family, he should have at least reached the peak of the Divine Spirit realm by now.</p><p></p><p>"Alright, my wise brother, I was just at a loss and spoke carelessly. Please don't take my earlier question to heart," Yunze Cang said with a resigned expression, closing his eyes.</p><p></p><p>Seeing this, Ye Xunmao sighed, "Your Majesty is too hard on yourself."</p><p></p><p>Yunze Cang opened his eyes and slowly rose from the throne, sweeping his gaze across the officials.</p><p></p><p>"If we must fight, then we shall fight!" he declared.</p><p></p><p>"Issue the order, all departments are to prepare for war!"</p><p></p><p>The officials' expressions were complex, hesitant to respond immediately to Yunze Cang's command.</p><p></p><p>Huh?</p><p></p><p>Yunze Cang's eyes narrowed as he spoke in a cold tone, "What? Do you all have some brilliant strategy?"</p><p></p><p>"Your Majesty, the ancient kingdom of Fenglan is too formidable for us in Yunlan to provoke!" </p><p></p><p>"Yes, Your Majesty, we all know this matter concerns the honor of the royal house, but a war would undoubtedly lead to great suffering!"</p><p></p><p>"Your Majesty, this humble official believes it would be best to have Princess Ning marry as a concession, as it could bring peace and stability. Princess Ning's meritorious deeds would be remembered forever in Yunlan."</p><p></p><p>"I second that!"</p><p>"I second that!"</p><p>"I second that!"</p><p></p><p>In the grand hall, the officials knelt on the ground, their opinions unanimous.</p><p></p><p>Seeing this, Yunze Cang's face flushed with anger, and he finally sat back down on the throne, waving his hand wearily.</p><p></p><p>"You may all take your leave. I will ask Ning'er's opinion. If she agrees, then we shall follow your suggestion. But if she is unwilling, then we shall go to war. I will not force her."</p><p></p><p>"Your Majesty is wise!" </p><p></p><p>The officials respectfully acknowledged, daring not to provoke Yunze Cang further. They rose trembling and left the grand hall in an orderly fashion.</p><p></p><p>"Your Majesty... Sigh," </p><p></p><p>Ye Xunmao wanted to say more but sighed and also left the hall.</p><p></p><p>Yunze Cang took a deep breath, his figure slowly disappearing from the throne.</p><p></p><p>...</p><p></p><p>In the palace, at the Weiyang Pavilion.</p><p></p><p>Yunze Cang's figure gradually appeared.</p><p></p><p>The palace maids outside the Weiyang Pavilion were startled to see him.</p><p></p><p>Here is the full English translation of the Chinese excerpt:</p><p></p><p>The servant hurriedly stepped forward and knelt down, trembling as he said, "Your Majesty!"</p><p></p><p>Emperor Yunze looked into the Weiyang Palace and asked, "Is the Princess resting?"</p><p></p><p>The maid respectfully replied, "Your Majesty, Princess Ning is currently in the back garden."</p><p></p><p>Yunze nodded and after standing for a while, he finally stepped into the Weiyang Palace.</p><p></p><p>The maids then shakily rose to their feet and stood respectfully to the side.</p><p></p><p>At this time, in the Weiyang Palace, Yunze went straight to the back garden and sure enough, he saw a young lady sitting quietly by the pond, seemingly lost in thought.</p><p></p><p>Yunze's eyes gleamed as he stepped forward and said with a smile, "It's been a while since I've come to see Ning'er."</p><p></p><p>The delicate young lady slowly stood up by the pond and turned around, finally revealing her appearance.</p><p></p><p>Her skin was fair and unblemished, her features exquisite like a fairy. Her eyes were clear and pure, no wonder she had caught the eye of the Crown Prince of the ancient Wind Luan Kingdom.</p><p></p><p>"Father," Ning gently bowed and softly called out.</p><p></p><p>"Hehe, come, let's chat with Father," Yunze smiled, taking Ning's small hand and leading her to sit down in the pavilion by the pond.</p><p></p><p>"Has Father come here for a reason?" Ning asked Yunze.</p><p></p><p>Yunze coughed awkwardly, "Does a father need a reason to come see his daughter?" </p><p></p><p>But Ning shook her head, "Father usually comes to see me every five days, and it's only been two days since the last time."</p><p></p><p>Yunze paused, realizing she was right. No wonder Ning could tell there was something on his mind.</p><p></p><p>After a moment of silence, Yunze looked at Ning and said, "Ning'er, ever since your mother passed away all these years, Father has never seen you smile."</p><p></p><p>Although Yunze's intention was clear - he wanted to see Ning smile - Ning still shook her head, her expression remaining somber.</p><p></p><p>"Father, if you have something to say, just say it. Ning is listening," Ning said.</p><p></p><p>Yunze gave a wry smile. Among all the princes and princesses in the palace, only Ning dared to speak to him this way, her tone hinting at a subtle impatience.</p><p></p><p>Yet it was so natural.</p><p></p><p>So Yunze asked, "Ning'er, do you still remember the Crown Prince of the ancient Wind Luan Kingdom you met long ago?"</p><p></p><p>Ning replied, "No, I don't remember."</p><p></p><p>Yunze nodded, unsurprised, and then directly said, "The Wind Luan Kingdom wanted to form a marriage alliance with our Cloud Lam Kingdom long ago, and the intended bride was you. Back then, Father firmly refused. But now the Wind Luan Kingdom wants to propose a marriage alliance again... so Father has come to ask, Ning'er, are you willing?"</p><p></p><p>As he spoke, Yunze continued smiling and waving his hand, "Ning'er, don't feel pressured. If you are unwilling, Father will immediately refuse!"</p><p></p><p>Ning looked at Yunze for a moment, then softly said, "Father, Ning is willing."</p><p></p><p>Yunze paused, completely unexpected that Ning would agree. He forced a smile and said, "Marriage is no trivial matter, Ning'er. Won't you consider it again?"</p><p></p><p>Ning slowly stood up and went to the side, looking at the seemingly unhappy fish in the pond.</p><p></p><p>"The first time, Father could directly refuse without asking Ning's opinion. But this time, Father has come to ask Ning, which means Father is under a lot of pressure. Ning doesn't want Father to be under pressure."</p><p></p><p>Yunze's heart trembled as he looked at the delicate figure of the young lady, his eyes slightly reddening.</p>

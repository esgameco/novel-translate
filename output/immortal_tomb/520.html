            <p>Here is the full English translation of the Chinese excerpt:</p><p></p><p>A moment later, Old Xu came out from the back kitchen, carrying a steaming hot bowl of scallion noodles, and placed it in front of Lu Changsheng.</p><p></p><p>"Here you are, Mr. Lu, the chopsticks."</p><p></p><p>Old Xu handed over the chopsticks.</p><p></p><p>Lu Changsheng took them, mixed the noodles, and then picked up the noodles without caring about the heat, slurping them down quickly.</p><p></p><p>Old Xu couldn't help but frown as he watched, though he was already used to it. He couldn't help but worry.</p><p></p><p>He thought to himself, "Is Mr. Lu's mouth made of iron?"</p><p></p><p>This was freshly boiled noodle soup, after all!</p><p></p><p>"Mr. Lu, can you taste the flavor this time?" Old Xu couldn't help but ask.</p><p></p><p>This time, he had deliberately added a bit more salt.</p><p></p><p>Lu Changsheng swallowed the noodles and said regretfully, "I still can't taste it. I'm afraid it will take more than a day or two to be able to appreciate the flavor of these noodles."</p><p></p><p>Old Xu's face twisted in bitterness. "Mr. Lu, Old Xu has already added more salt, but I didn't expect your taste to be so strong. Shall I add even more next time?"</p><p></p><p>Lu Changsheng readily agreed, "Okay, Old Xu, you go and busy yourself. It's almost dinner time, and customers will be coming soon."</p><p></p><p>"Alright then, Mr. Lu, please take your time."</p><p></p><p>Old Xu went back to the kitchen, chuckling.</p><p></p><p>At the same time, three people came into the noodle shop, chatting as they entered.</p><p></p><p>"Have you heard? In a while, the Tianwu Sect will be recruiting disciples, and they're even coming to our Jixiang Town!"</p><p></p><p>"Of course I've heard. When the time comes, I'll have my son try it out. Wouldn't that be better than just studying?"</p><p></p><p>"Yes, that's true... Ah, Mr. Lu!"</p><p></p><p>"Mr. Lu!"</p><p></p><p>The three people, as they were talking, suddenly noticed Lu Changsheng in the noodle shop and quickly went forward to bow respectfully.</p><p></p><p>Although the Changsheng Academy was the smallest private school in Jixiang Town, everyone knew that the teacher there, Mr. Lu, must be quite remarkable, as even the lord of the town treated him with great respect. Of course, these common folk didn't dare to be negligent towards him.</p><p></p><p>Lu Changsheng smiled and said, "You three don't need to be so formal. I'm just an ordinary teacher, what merit do I have to receive such grand greetings from you?"</p><p></p><p>The three people pursed their lips, gave an embarrassed smile, and nodded before going to sit down in the corner.</p><p></p><p>They couldn't help but sigh inwardly: "What an 'ordinary' teacher."</p><p></p><p>"Old Xu, three bowls of scallion noodles, please."</p><p></p><p>"Alright!"</p><p></p><p>After ordering the three bowls of scallion noodles, the three people began whispering to each other, not speaking loudly, so as not to disturb Lu Changsheng.</p><p></p><p>Soon after, four or five more people entered the noodle shop and, upon seeing Lu Changsheng, also greeted him respectfully.</p><p></p><p>At this point, the noodle shop was full, as it was not a large place and could only accommodate around ten people at most.</p><p></p><p>Lu Changsheng finished his meal quickly, took three copper coins from his sleeve, placed them on the table, and quietly left the noodle shop, unnoticed by anyone.</p><p></p><p>Although he was no longer in the boundless void, the worldly monetary transactions were not much different from the Lingchen Realm. They still used copper, silver, and gold coins, and the exchange rates were similar, all at a ratio of one to a thousand, simple and straightforward.</p><p></p><p>As for his fifteen students, Lu Changsheng just went through the motions, casually collecting a bit from them.</p><p></p><p>Just as many of the townspeople of Jixiang had said, Lu Changsheng's recruitment of students was based on affinity.</p><p></p><p>He, Lu Changsheng, was not short of money at all.</p><p></p><p>In this world, known as the Shu Wu Xuan Tian, the strong were still revered.</p><p></p><p>However, when Lu Changsheng arrived in this realm, he discovered an interesting thing - there were two cultivation systems here.</p><p></p><p>One was the Way of the Brush, and the other was the Way of the Martial Arts, both coexisting.</p><p></p><p>But in the Shu Wu Xuan Tian, the Way of the Brush was somewhat lacking, while the Way of the Martial Arts was particularly flourishing.</p><p></p><p>The Way of the Brush, with its ability to slay enemies with the power of the written word, did have its own merits.</p><p></p><p>Regarding this refreshingly new Way of the Brush, Lu Changsheng was very interested. After a simple understanding, he quickly communicated with the will of heaven and earth, reaching a position unprecedented in history. It could be said that in the Way of the Brush, he was already the number one figure in the Shu Wu Xuan Tian.</p><p></p><p>Here is the full English translation of the Chinese excerpt:</p><p></p><p>Although it was a bit hasty, but that's the fact.</p><p></p><p>In fact, when Luchang Sheng had grasped the Book Martial Heavenly Dao to its peak, the Book Martial Heavenly Dao was about to manifest a super phenomenon, but it was lightly suppressed by Luchang Sheng.</p><p></p><p>Afterwards, adhering to the principle of enjoying life while passing time, he came to this Jixiang Town and established the Longevity Academy.</p><p></p><p>Being someone who dislikes trouble, before establishing it, he had directly "taken care of" all the prominent figures in Jixiang Town.</p><p></p><p>That's why there was the scene of the mayor and others being respectful and reverent during the opening ceremony.</p><p></p><p>Luchang Sheng, who could use martial force to intimidate, was certainly not stingy about it, straightforward - he was here to enjoy, not to get entangled with people.</p><p></p><p>In his complete state, as long as he wished, he could do whatever he wanted.</p><p></p><p>In establishing the Longevity Academy, Luchang Sheng wanted to revive the way of the Book.</p><p></p><p>Of course, it was not him reviving it, but relying on his students to revive it. He was just teaching casually when he was free, and could also be called a guide.</p><p></p><p>He had already maxed out, so what was there to revive? </p><p></p><p>As long as he wanted, he could just blink his eyes and the Book Martial Heavenly Dao would collapse, but would that be interesting? No, it wouldn't.</p><p></p><p>Among the fifteen students, the one Luchang Sheng was most optimistic about was actually the one who couldn't even read smoothly - Han Yue.</p><p></p><p>That kid had the bearing of a Book Saint.</p><p></p><p>Luchang Sheng was walking aimlessly, lost in thought, and before he knew it, he had arrived outside the Qingqing Pavilion.</p><p></p><p>Hmm, a brothel.</p><p></p><p>Although the name "Qingqing Pavilion" sounds more elegant, it is still a brothel.</p><p></p><p>"Mr. Luchang, come in and have a seat~"</p><p></p><p>"Mr. Luchang, you've passed by our Qingqing Pavilion many times, this time you must grace us with your presence and come in to sit~"</p><p></p><p>At the entrance of the Qingqing Pavilion, three heavily made-up girls coquettishly waved their lotus-like fingers and beckoned.</p><p></p><p>These brothel girls, experienced in the ways of the world, knew well that one shouldn't bite the hand that feeds, and even if the town lord passed by, they would still call out to him with a smile.</p><p></p><p>And this new teacher, with his unique temperament and unparalleled gentlemanly bearing, although they were not worthy, they were still delighted to exchange a few words with him.</p><p></p><p>Most importantly, they knew this young scholar would not enter the brothel, their flirtatious words were just playful banter.</p><p></p><p>In the Book Martial Heavenly Dao, teachers almost never entered a brothel in broad daylight, that would be damaging to their reputation.</p><p></p><p>But the next moment, the girls were dumbfounded.</p><p></p><p>They saw Luchang Sheng stop in his steps, tilt his head and smile, "Do you have good wine to drink? Do you have wonderful music to listen to? If not, I won't go in."</p><p></p><p>Not only were the girls of the Qingqing Pavilion dumbfounded, even the passersby on the street had a stunned expression, looking at Luchang Sheng with disbelief!</p><p></p><p>What's going on here? </p><p></p><p>The teacher of the Longevity Academy actually wants to enter the Qingqing Pavilion?</p><p></p><p>"So you don't have any?" Luchang Sheng asked curiously.</p><p></p><p>"Ah ah ah, we do, we do! Mr. Luchang, please come in!" </p><p></p><p>The girls hurriedly came down the stairs and approached, but consciously maintained a distance.</p><p></p><p>Luchang Sheng smiled and from his sleeve, which seemed like a treasure trove, fished out three silver coins and casually tossed them over.</p><p></p><p>The three girls quickly caught them, and upon seeing the silver coins in their hands, their expressions were shocked and delighted! </p><p></p><p>This was too extravagant! The casual tip was three silver coins??</p><p></p><p>"Mr. Luchang, the way you threw the money just now was so handsome! Isn't that right, sisters?"</p><p></p><p>"Yes yes, it was really handsome, my eyes are practically sparkling!"</p><p></p><p>"Hehe, since my mother gave birth to me, I've never seen a man as handsome as Mr. Luchang."</p><p></p><p>Luchang Sheng was originally smiling, but after hearing the last part, his expression darkened...</p><p></p><p>What the hell.</p>

        <h1>Chapter 102</h1>
        <div class="content">
            <p>Here is the full English translation of the Chinese excerpt:</p><p></p><p>In the Spiritual Dust Realm, outside the capital city of the Water Nation. ‚úäüíö‚ùª‚ûà≈û ∞œÖ·ô≠.ÔΩÉœÉÔΩç‡∂è‚òÜ</p><p></p><p>"Big Saber, this is what the Master left for you to be delivered by me before he departed."</p><p></p><p>Gu Helin pushed the wooden box on the table towards him, smiling.</p><p></p><p>Behind him, Tong Xin and Lin Dong were standing there with joyful expressions, their moods exceptionally good.</p><p></p><p>The heavenly treasures bestowed upon them by the Master were simply astounding, treasures that the Spiritual Dust Realm could not even possess!</p><p></p><p>At this rate, after the Master's ascension, barring any accidents, they too would be able to ascend, and it would not take too long.</p><p></p><p>The Master was truly a benefactor on their immortal path!</p><p></p><p>"The Master... has left?" </p><p></p><p>Chen Dasao did not notice the wooden box, but instead asked in a trembling voice.</p><p></p><p>That azure-robed figure had just left... never to be seen again.</p><p></p><p>Currently, Chen Dasao held a high position in the capital. Dong Ge knew that Chen Dasao had some connection with Lu Changsheng, so he had taken good care of him.</p><p></p><p>He was enfeoffed as the Chen King, granted a grand manor, and bestowed with countless maids and servants to attend to him.</p><p></p><p>However, Chen Dasao was not happy.</p><p></p><p>His wife and steward were all in a state of extreme bliss.</p><p></p><p>He missed the old days in the small border town, but time could not be turned back, he could not go back.</p><p></p><p>Gu Helin fell silent, nodded, and sighed, "Indeed, the Master has left, gone to the Immortal Realm."</p><p></p><p>"The Immortal Realm?" Chen Dasao murmured, but upon recalling that azure-robed figure, he soon found peace.</p><p></p><p>"Open it and take a look," Gu Helin gestured.</p><p></p><p>Chen Dasao took the wooden box, gently caressed it, and then opened it.</p><p></p><p>Suddenly, a dizzying medicinal fragrance rapidly permeated, soon enveloping the entire manor.</p><p></p><p>Fortunately, Gu Helin had set up formations in advance, preventing the fragrance from leaking out.</p><p></p><p>Chen Dasao stared blankly at the snow-white heavenly lotus in the wooden box, its entire form emanating a faint white glow.</p><p></p><p>That medicinal fragrance, Chen Dasao had only caught a whiff of it, and he already felt his entire qi and blood violently shaking, his face flushed red.</p><p></p><p>"Venerable Gu, this... what is this...?" Chen Dasao asked hoarsely.</p><p></p><p>"The Master said this herb is called the Life Spirit Heavenly Lotus. We have never seen it before, but judging from the name, and the fact that the Master has bestowed it upon you, this herb should be able to grant a person without spiritual roots the ability to obtain spiritual roots, thereby stepping onto the immortal cultivation path."</p><p></p><p>Gu Helin exclaimed in amazement.</p><p></p><p>If this Life Spirit Heavenly Lotus truly lived up to its name, then it would be truly defying the heavens...</p><p></p><p>To forcibly pull an ordinary person into the immortal path, this was nothing short of defying the heavens and changing one's fate.</p><p></p><p>It was an absolute reversal of destiny.</p><p></p><p>Tong Xin and Lin Dong were also filled with astonishment.</p><p></p><p>Chen Dasao stood there dumbfounded, his eyes becoming blurred from moisture...</p><p></p><p>"Dasao, let me ask you one more time, do you still wish to cultivate immortality?"</p><p></p><p>"Master, this immortality... I will not cultivate it anymore..."</p><p></p><p>The scene of the old steward's passing and his last conversation with Lu Changsheng was vividly etched in his mind.</p><p></p><p>That was also the last time they met.</p><p></p><p>"Venerable Gu, you keep this Heavenly Lotus. Dasao is already advanced in years, I don't want to waste this precious treasure."</p><p></p><p>Chen Dasao forced a smile and pushed the wooden box back.</p><p></p><p>Gu Helin furrowed his brows and said sternly, "Let you keep it, and you keep it. What's with this fussiness? I will carry out the Master's instructions to the letter!"</p><p></p><p>Saying that, he exerted strands of spiritual power to restrain the dazed Chen Dasao, and shouted at Tong Xin and Lin Dong, "You two, what are you still standing there for? Hurry up and grind the Life Spirit Heavenly Lotus into powder, and brew it into a tea for him to drink!"</p><p></p><p>"Yes, Master!" </p><p></p><p>Tong Xin and Lin Dong immediately sprang into action, quickly grinding the Life Spirit Heavenly Lotus into powder, then adding it to the tea, stirring it, and finally forcing the entire concoction down Chen Dasao's mouth, their movements fluid and seamless.</p><p></p><p>In the next moment,</p><p></p><p>A scorching heat surged up from Chen Dasao's dantian, and he felt as if his entire body was on fire, his qi and blood in a state of violent turmoil.</p><p></p><p>Here is the full English translation of the Chinese excerpt:</p><p></p><p>Ancient Crane Lin came up behind Chen Datao and placed his palm on his back.</p><p></p><p>„ÄêNew 69 Book Bar„Äë</p><p></p><p>Suddenly, the divine spiritual lotus powder completely dissolved in Chen Datao's abdomen, causing a complete upheaval of his viscera, flesh, tendons, and bones!</p><p></p><p>The two children then saw countless dirty and foul-smelling mud seep out from Chen Datao's skin.</p><p></p><p>At that moment, his white hair miraculously turned jet-black.</p><p></p><p>Some wrinkles on his face also became smooth, and his facial skin became as soft and delicate as a newborn baby.</p><p></p><p>Chen Datao opened his eyes, revealing a pair of pitch-black pupils that were purer than before.</p><p></p><p>He stared blankly at his palms for a long, long time.</p><p></p><p>Chen Datao could clearly feel that he... had completely changed.</p><p></p><p>Moreover, there were several strands of qi circulating in his dantian...</p><p></p><p>"Sir, you are truly a divine person." </p><p></p><p>Ancient Crane Lin came before Chen Datao, exclaiming in disbelief.</p><p></p><p>In the Spiritual Dust Realm, such a thing had never occurred before - an ordinary person without any spiritual roots suddenly gaining spiritual roots.</p><p></p><p>It was no exaggeration to say that this was a reversal of fate, a transformation from decay to divinity!</p><p></p><p>The value of that divine spiritual lotus was immeasurable...</p><p></p><p>Tongxin and Lin Dong also frantically nodded in agreement with Ancient Crane Lin's words.</p><p></p><p>Immediately after, Ancient Crane Lin struck Chen Datao with a purification technique.</p><p></p><p>Instantly, the dirty and foul-smelling mud was thoroughly cleansed from his body.</p><p></p><p>Ancient Crane Lin pointed at Chen Datao's forehead and exclaimed in amazement, "Exquisite wood spiritual root..."</p><p></p><p>"Datao, if you come back to the Qiyun Sect with me to cultivate, how about taking me as your master?" Ancient Crane Lin promptly asked.</p><p></p><p>Without hesitation, Chen Datao stood up and bowed, saying, "Master."</p><p></p><p>Ancient Crane Lin was taken aback for a moment, then stroked his beard and smiled, "Haha, good!"</p><p></p><p>Boom!!</p><p></p><p>At this moment, there was an abnormal phenomenon in the sky.</p><p></p><p>Rolling clouds, rumbling thunder!</p><p></p><p>"Hmm?" </p><p></p><p>Ancient Crane Lin and the others looked up in astonishment, their gazes grave.</p><p></p><p>Indeed, any extraordinary event would inevitably invite destruction...</p><p></p><p>At the same time, under the majestic celestial power, the capital city fell into panic, and everyone could feel that this was different from the usual rainy weather.</p><p></p><p>How could it go from a clear sky to rumbling thunder in an instant? It was simply unheard of.</p><p></p><p>Could it be that demons were attacking?</p><p></p><p>The disaster-prone people of the Lishui Kingdom were exceptionally sensitive.</p><p></p><p>"I understand now!!" </p><p></p><p>In the royal palace, Dong Ge suddenly exclaimed.</p><p></p><p>"Your Majesty, what have you understood now?" </p><p></p><p>The officials looked at Dong Ge curiously, their faces full of curiosity, but inwardly speechless.</p><p></p><p>They were used to it - ever since Dong Ge ascended the throne, it had been one "I understand" after another, every day.</p><p></p><p>What's more, each time it seemed to be surprisingly accurate.</p><p></p><p>"Hehe, my dear officials, you don't know this, but this thunder is not caused by some rampaging demon, but is related to the gentleman!" Dong Ge said confidently.</p><p></p><p>The officials: "?"</p><p></p><p>Dong Ge smiled mysteriously, "Don't look at me like that, I can only tell you that this is my intuition!"</p><p></p><p>Rumble!!</p><p></p><p>At this moment, the thunder in the sky suddenly struck towards Chen Datao's residence!</p><p></p><p>"That direction, it seems to be the Chen King's residence!" the people exclaimed in alarm.</p><p></p><p>In Chen's residence, Ancient Crane Lin looked at this scene in horror, recalling the old turtle's sky-pointing and cursing in the Unnamed Tavern, and gritted his teeth, shouting, "Outrageous!! This is the gentleman's affair, how dare you interfere!!"</p><p></p><p>His voice echoed throughout the capital.</p><p></p><p>The next moment, the lightning that was about to strike retracted back into the clouds, and the sky quickly cleared.</p><p></p><p>The people stared blankly, as if the overwhelming celestial power they had just witnessed was just a dream.</p><p></p><p>In the royal palace, ignoring the dumbfounded officials, Dong Ge excitedly shouted, "Did you see it? Did you see it? I knew it was related to the gentleman!!"</p>

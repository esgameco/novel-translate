        <h1>Chapter 22</h1>
        <div class="content">
            <p>Here is the full English translation of the Chinese excerpt:</p><p></p><p>Listening to the chilling voice that echoed through the night sky. üçß‚ô£‚ùª‚ûà≈ú‚íΩùï¶ùêó.ùí∏œÉùì∂‚ô†üò∫</p><p></p><p>The King of the Lishui Kingdom dryly smacked his lips and murmured, </p><p></p><p>"Demons, they are truly demons..."</p><p></p><p>The officials also turned pale-faced, hastily speaking,</p><p></p><p>"Your Majesty, what are we to do?!"</p><p></p><p>"With so many commoners gathered, isn't this exactly what the demons desire..."</p><p></p><p>"Look at the thick black mist swirling, the number of demons must be substantial. Not only the commoners, even our own lives are in jeopardy..."</p><p></p><p>"..."</p><p></p><p>The King of the Lishui Kingdom suddenly turned and grabbed Chen Dadao's sleeve, urgently saying, "Dadao! Quickly summon the Immortal! Didn't you say the demons that came before were all slaughtered by the Immortal?! Hurry!"</p><p></p><p>The King's hand gripping Chen Dadao's sleeve was deathly pale, revealing his desperation.</p><p></p><p>Chen Dadao had a troubled expression as he replied, "Your Majesty, it is true that the Immortal exterminated the previous demons, but as for whether he will take action this time, this humble servant has no right to interfere!"</p><p></p><p>During this period, he had also come to understand Luchengsheng's temperament - </p><p></p><p>he was completely capricious! </p><p></p><p>Not at all like the immortal cultivator who sees it as his duty to eliminate demons from the world, as Chen Dadao had initially thought.</p><p></p><p>Moreover, he had already sought the Immortal out once before, to have him come again... and the Immortal was residing in his own manor, which Chen Dadao had pleaded for him to stay in.</p><p></p><p>Hearing this, the King of the Lishui Kingdom's expression fluctuated between light and dark, but when he saw the chaos outside the city walls, he could no longer hold back and was about to rush down from the walls, his indignant words echoing,</p><p></p><p>"Fine! If you won't go, then I, the King, shall go myself!!"</p><p></p><p>Seeing this, Chen Dadao felt a pang in his heart, and so he gritted his teeth and chased after the King: "Your Majesty, this humble servant will accompany you!"</p><p></p><p>But just then!</p><p></p><p>A sword light shot up into the sky, illuminating the dark night!</p><p></p><p>"You demons of the Demon Realm! Recklessly invading the empire under the jurisdiction of my Qingyan Sect, have you forgotten the covenant of the Three Realms?!"</p><p></p><p>The resounding voice echoed far and wide!</p><p></p><p>Both inside and outside the city, everything fell silent, the commoners staring dumbfoundedly at the hovering sword light in the sky,</p><p></p><p>A Immortal, a true Immortal?! There really is an Immortal!!</p><p></p><p>"An Immortal, this must be an Immortal, I told you all my ancestors had seen an Immortal but you didn't believe me! Have you ever seen a mortal able to fly in the sky?!"</p><p></p><p>The commoners were in an uproar, looking up at the sword light with reverence. </p><p></p><p>Could it be that they have been saved today?</p><p></p><p>This was a living, breathing Immortal appearing before their eyes!</p><p></p><p>.........</p><p></p><p>On the city walls.</p><p></p><p>The King of the Lishui Kingdom and the others were stunned, staring at the sky. At this critical moment, the Immortal from the Qingyan Sect had finally arrived!</p><p></p><p>"This is my master, the Ancient Perfected One of the Qingyan Sect."</p><p></p><p>At this time, Tong Xin came to stand beside the King of the Lishui Kingdom and the others, gazing up at the hovering sword light and calmly speaking.</p><p></p><p>He had somehow also made his way to the city walls.</p><p></p><p>"We pay our respects to the Immortal!"</p><p></p><p>The King of the Lishui Kingdom and the officials hurriedly bowed in reverence.</p><p></p><p>Chen Dadao also bent down in a deep bow.</p><p></p><p>"Don't worry, with my master here, these demons won't be able to stir up any trouble."</p><p></p><p>Tong Xin crossed his arms, speaking solemnly.</p><p></p><p>Hearing this, the King of the Lishui Kingdom and the others let out a sigh of relief, bowing and thanking him, "Then we shall rely on you."</p><p></p><p>Tong Xin did not speak further, watching the sword light in the sky with anticipation.</p><p>It had been a long time since he had seen his master take action.</p><p></p><p>.........</p><p></p><p>In the sky, numerous black mists suddenly materialized into dozens of Black Tongue Demons, facing off against the Ancient Crane Immortal.</p><p></p><p>Leading them were five Black Tongue Demons even larger in size.</p><p></p><p>"Hehe, I wonder which Golden Dan cultivator you are, Ancient Perfected One of the Qingyan Sect, it is an honor to meet you..."</p><p></p><p>The Black Tongue Demon Patriarch in the middle slowly floated out, coldly smiling at the Ancient Crane Immortal.</p><p></p><p>Here is the full English translation of the Chinese excerpt:</p><p></p><p>"There was a hint of solemnity in his gaze. Gu Helin had already reached the late stage of the Golden Core realm decades ago, so could it be that he had now reached the peak of the Golden Core realm?"</p><p></p><p>"You've heard of Gu Certain, but Gu Certain doesn't know you, haha."</p><p></p><p>Gu Helin continued expressionlessly, "Enough nonsense, let me ask you, are you from the Demon Realm trying to start a war with our Spiritual Cultivation Realm?"</p><p></p><p>The Black Tongue Demon Tribe Chief smiled insincerely, "Senior Gu, you're overthinking it. How could the Demon Realm possibly start a war with the Spiritual Cultivation Realm? It's just my Black Tongue Demon Tribe acting on our own."</p><p></p><p>Gu Helin glanced at the four figures beside the Black Tongue Demon Tribe Chief, and his heart shook slightly after his inspection.</p><p></p><p>Five-Ranked Demonic Monsters! Four of them at the level of early Golden Core!</p><p></p><p>Add to that the Black Tongue Demon Tribe Chief, who was comparable to the late stage of the Golden Core realm...</p><p></p><p>Gu Helin's heart was filled with gravity!</p><p></p><p>He would have a hard time dealing with just these five alone, let alone the dozens of Second-Ranked Black Tongue Demons.</p><p></p><p>"Acting on your own? Your 'acting on your own' seems rather targeted, doesn't it..." Gu Helin said mockingly, steadying his nerves.</p><p></p><p>The Black Tongue Demon Tribe Chief's expression changed slightly, and he no longer wanted to say more. His long black tongue curled up and licked the corner of his mouth as he sneered, "Tonight, the esteemed Senior Gu will see whether he can withstand us... Kill!"</p><p></p><p>Instantly, the Black Tongue Demons behind him stirred, swinging their long tongues and diving down, thirsty for blood! As for Gu Helin, they knew their Tribe Chief would handle him.</p><p></p><p>Gu Helin's brows furrowed, and he flipped his palm to reveal a formation plate!</p><p></p><p>The next moment, he decisively threw it towards the Black Tongue Demons below!</p><p></p><p>The formation plate transformed into a faint stream of light, flying with incredible speed, quickly approaching the dozens of Black Tongue Demons.</p><p></p><p>With a "bang," the formation plate exploded, and thousands of luminous threads instantly wove into a large spherical ball, easily trapping the dozens of Black Tongue Demons within!</p><p></p><p>The Black Tongue Demons trapped in the formation found the scenery before them had drastically changed - they felt as if they were trapped in a complex maze. No matter how they moved, they could not escape this "maze." They quickly became agitated!</p><p></p><p>At the same time, all the people below looked up in shock at the floating light ball! They had just witnessed those dozens of demons being easily confined by the light ball. The techniques of the Immortal were truly profound and mysterious.</p><p></p><p>"As expected of Senior Gu, casually using a Fourth-Rank Restraining Formation that even early Golden Core cultivators would have difficulty breaking, to deal with mere Second-Rank Demons. How generous," the Black Tongue Demon Tribe Chief said, narrowing his eyes and sneering.</p><p></p><p>Gu Helin glanced at the light ball, his heart tense. This Fourth-Rank Restraining Formation also had a time limit. If he couldn't kill these five Black Tongue Demons before the time ran out, he was afraid...</p><p></p><p>"Enough nonsense, tonight I will definitely slay your dog lives!" Gu Helin said, quickly forming hand seals. Threads of soft light began to swirl around his fingertips, quite mystical. At the same time, his Golden Core trembled, and his spiritual energy surged!</p><p></p><p>Whoosh!</p><p></p><p>The oppressive aura of a peak Golden Core cultivator suddenly poured down from the sky!</p><p></p><p>All the people on the ground turned pale, though they didn't know what was happening, only that the air had become thin and somewhat suffocating.</p><p></p><p>Tongxin shook his head with a wry smile. If they weren't in the sky and if his master hadn't deliberately suppressed the Golden Core aura, these commoners would have suffered even more.</p><p></p><p>He quickly looked up again, his gaze tinged with worry. His master was indeed powerful, but those Black Tongue Demons were no easy opponents either!</p>

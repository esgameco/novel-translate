        <h1>Chapter 126</h1>
        <div class="content">
            <p>Here is my translation of the Chinese excerpt:</p><p></p><p>A few days later, on the sands of the city,</p><p></p><p>Countless cultivators had flushed faces and shrinking eyes as they looked at the vast figures in the distance......</p><p></p><p>It can be said that, although they knew the foreign tribes were going to attack from the outskirts of the Langtian Domain, there were still many foreign cultivators who fearlessly rushed over here to watch the excitement. (-_-) ‚ùª‚ûàùêíÔΩàùì§ùìß.ùî†‚ìÑùìú (-_-)</p><p></p><p>There's no help for it, in the past they couldn't even see a Great Immortal, but today even Immortal Emperors have appeared......</p><p></p><p>They didn't want to miss this once-in-a-million-years scene!</p><p></p><p>"The ones at the very front should be the Yin-Yang Immortal Emperor of the Southern Immortal Realm and the Wushi Immortal Emperor of the Northern Immortal Realm, right? So... so powerful...."</p><p></p><p>"Yes, I've never even seen a Chaos Immortal Lord in my life, and yet today I'm witnessing this - it's truly unbelievable, my eyes have been opened wide today, even if the foreign tribes invade, I would die without regrets."</p><p></p><p>"You want to die, but I don't want to die, and those mortals don't want to die either, can't you see they're all hiding at home, afraid to come out?"</p><p></p><p>"Haha, this is already the top lineup of the Immortal Realm, I don't believe those foreign tribes could be that powerful!"</p><p></p><p>"......"</p><p></p><p>Among them, some familiar faces could even be seen - the Chu, Huang, and Chen immortal clans, as well as Chu Xiruo and Zhang Youdao.</p><p></p><p>In more hidden corners, some faces from the Lingchen Realm could also be clearly seen.</p><p></p><p>Qin Miaomiao and Liu Wuxiu, the two of them standing together, from their spiritual state it could be seen that they had not been in the Immortal Realm for long and had not yet made a name for themselves.</p><p></p><p>As for that Jiwuqing and Jiang Yuan, they were nowhere to be seen.</p><p></p><p>"Miss Qin, do you see that's Zhang Youdao?" Liu Wuxiu pointed towards the location of the Chu immortal clan.</p><p></p><p>Qin Miaomiao was slightly surprised, following Liu Wuxiu's gaze, and indeed, the old man standing beside the woman in white robes was none other than Zhang Youdao...</p><p></p><p>That woman in white robes was also familiar to them, as she had appeared at Zhang Youdao's ascension ceremony in the Lingchen Realm.</p><p></p><p>"It is indeed Brother Zhang, it seems he joined an immortal clan in the Langtian Domain after ascending to the Immortal Realm." Qin Miaomiao sighed.</p><p></p><p>Liu Wuxiu gave a bitter smile: "At least he's better off than us two wandering cultivators. We really are unlucky, we just heard that the Tianheng Sect was destroyed when we first ascended."</p><p></p><p>After all, that had been their guiding sect.</p><p></p><p>Soon the two fell silent, not having the intention to go greet Zhang Youdao for now.</p><p></p><p>In the distance, the vast figures were like those from the Eastern Immortal Realm, standing in the air, each aura terrifying beyond measure.</p><p></p><p>At the very front were Ancient Yin-Yang and Shi Wushi, behind them were Nangong Jing and nine Immortal Lords, the three Immortal Lords from the Central Immortal Realm had been sent here.</p><p></p><p>Further back were hundreds of Immortal Kings, as well as thousands of Chaos Immortal Lords and tens of thousands of Great Dao Immortals.</p><p></p><p>Li Gecheng, who had been rescued from the Patrol Hall by Lu Changsheng, was also silently standing among the ranks of the Chaos Immortal Lords.</p><p></p><p>"Nangong, as the Master of the Heavenly Mechanism Pavilion, do you know the odds of victory this time?"</p><p></p><p>Ancient Yin-Yang looked ahead, asking solemnly.</p><p></p><p>Nangong Jing stepped forward, coming to a position slightly behind Ancient Yin-Yang and Shi Wushi, and softly said, "Including the Immortal Emperor Changsheng?"</p><p></p><p>Ancient Yin-Yang and Shi Wushi paused.</p><p></p><p>Shi Wushi laughed, "Immortal Emperor Changsheng is nowhere to be found at the moment, so naturally he is not counted."</p><p></p><p>Nangong Jing nodded and said, "Then the odds are only one in ten."</p><p></p><p>One in ten?? </p><p></p><p>Ancient Yin-Yang and Shi Wushi were dumbfounded, you might as well just say there is no chance of victory.</p><p></p><p>"What if we include Immortal Emperor Changsheng?" Shi Wushi asked again.</p><p></p><p>Nangong Jing: "As for Immortal Emperor Changsheng, I don't know him too well, but if he is included, the odds of victory would be at least five in ten."</p><p></p><p>Huh....</p><p></p><p>Shi Wushi muttered, "So with all of us together, the odds are only one in ten, but with just Immortal Emperor Changsheng, the odds increase by four in ten? Meaning, aside from Immortal Emperor Changsheng, the rest of us are useless?"</p><p></p><p>Nangong Jing fell silent.</p><p></p><p>He did not mean it that way.</p><p></p><p>Ancient Yin-Yang opened his mouth, wanting to say something, but just then the ground began to tremble, and his pupils suddenly constricted!</p><p></p><p>Here is the full English translation of the Chinese excerpt:</p><p></p><p>The faces of the crowd changed, as if they sensed something, and they all stared intently towards the outside of the barrier.</p><p></p><p>From the desert, a massive dark shadow came flying, the violent winds stirred up by the flapping of countless demonic wings kicking up a fierce sandstorm.</p><p></p><p>The ground trembled ever more violently!</p><p></p><p>"They're here! The foreign tribe has arrived!"</p><p></p><p>"Such a huge commotion, such a massive number, such ferocious power - no wonder the powerhouses of the Immortal Realm have mobilized this time!"</p><p></p><p>"What's there to be afraid of? With the Immortal Emperor and so many great figures here, the foreign tribe won't be able to stir up any waves. But it's truly a rare blessing to witness the Immortal Emperor taking action today!"</p><p></p><p>"Don't think it's that simple. For some reason, I have an ominous premonition..."</p><p></p><p>On the Sand City, countless cultivators shuddered, some with excited expressions, others with worried ones.</p><p></p><p>Feeling the tremors like an earthquake, countless ordinary people huddled in their homes, their hearts in turmoil!</p><p></p><p>"Everyone, be on guard!!" </p><p></p><p>Gu Yinyang's face was grim as he shouted.</p><p></p><p>Instantly, whether it was the Immortal Venerable, the Immortal Kings, or those Chaos Great Transcendents behind him, their clothes were all violently fluttering!</p><p></p><p>Unprecedented immortal energy coalesced into substance, covering the heavens and earth, ruthlessly compressing this world!</p><p></p><p>They were poised and ready!</p><p></p><p>Soon, the massive army of the Nether Demon Tribe flew to the outside of the southern Immortal Realm's barrier, their huge wings flapping as they circled in the sky.</p><p></p><p>Their numbers were so dense that they seemed to fill the entire sky.</p><p></p><p>Their ghastly appearances, their bulging muscles and protruding veins, as if they were born for battle!</p><p></p><p>The sight made the crowd's scalps tingle, suppressing their fear with difficulty.</p><p></p><p>At the very front were ten figures.</p><p></p><p>Youshuo swept his gaze over the figures within the barrier, coldly chuckling, "Hahaha! You all in the Immortal Realm have indeed prepared thoroughly, knowing of the arrival of our Nether Demon Tribe. But do you really think that with just the two Immortal Emperors, you can block us?"</p><p></p><p>Inside the barrier, </p><p>the crowd was gripped by terror. The ten figures at the very front of the Nether Demon Tribe were each as powerful as an Immortal Emperor!</p><p></p><p>"Ten... ten of them..." </p><p></p><p>Gu Yinyang stared at Youshuo and the others, trembling as he murmured.</p><p></p><p>"What's going on... the Nether Demon Tribe has ten peak experts, and they've all come to our place? Didn't they go to the Eastern Immortal Realm?"</p><p></p><p>Shi Wushi's face also turned slightly pale. Who could withstand this?</p><p></p><p>Youshuo immediately saw through what Gu Yinyang and Shi Wushi were thinking, and he sneered coldly: "Hehe, don't bother guessing. Let me tell you, our Nether Demon Tribe has twenty experts on the level of your five Immortal Realms' Immortal Emperors. What can your five Immortal Realms do against us?"</p><p></p><p>His words fell, and the world fell silent.</p><p>Everyone was horrified, a chill running down their spines, no longer harboring any hope or desire to watch the spectacle.</p><p></p><p>"Hehe, I don't have time to talk to you any longer -"</p><p></p><p>"My children, let the blood soak the lands of the five Immortal Realms - kill!"</p><p></p><p>Youshuo waved his hand without further ado.</p><p></p><p>Instantly, countless dark shadows took flight, surging towards the barrier like a terrifying flood, their momentum shaking the heavens!</p><p></p><p>The crowd was greatly alarmed, their faces involuntarily paling.</p><p></p><p>Gu Yinyang's expression changed slightly, and he quickly brandished the Immortal Emperor's Decree in his hand.</p><p></p><p>He raised the Immortal Emperor's Decree high, the immortal energy in his body surging, a power unique to the Immortal Emperor of the Southern Immortal Realm flowing into the Decree. He shouted in alarm,</p><p></p><p>"Immortal Emperor's Decree, forged with the power of generations of Immortal Emperors of the Southern Immortal Realm! Condense!!"</p><p></p><p>At the same time,</p><p></p><p>In a dazzling world, Lu Changsheng's steps paused, and he turned to look towards a distant direction, sighing lightly,</p><p></p><p>"So the battle has begun so soon."</p>

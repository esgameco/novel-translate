        <h1>Chapter 320</h1>
        <div class="content">
            <p>Here is the full English translation of the Chinese excerpt:</p><p></p><p>Everything was happening in the vast and high heavens, which people like Duan Jiuxiong could not see clearly, and they could only judge by the sounds coming from the heavens.</p><p></p><p>Although they did not understand what was specifically happening, they could grasp the general situation through the sounds.</p><p></p><p>It seemed that the Ancient Clan was losing in the battle against the Heavenly Dao Lord, and the so-called "Summoning the Ancestor" should be the last resort.</p><p></p><p>Some cultivators had witnessed the destruction of the Ancient Desolate Sword Clan in the past, so they deeply understood what "Summoning the Ancestor" meant - it meant that the Ancient Clan had been pushed to the brink by the Heavenly Dao Lord.</p><p></p><p>The heavens.</p><p></p><p>Seven figures slowly appeared, like tangible entities. They wore different attires, but they all had a simple and pure aura, a sense of returning to the roots.</p><p></p><p>However, Lu Changsheng, who was far away in the Moon-Star Realm, could see them clearly. Among the seven, five were inferior to the Sword Immortal Sword Wuhui.</p><p></p><p>Only two of them might be comparable to Sword Wuhui.</p><p></p><p>"Greet the ancestors!"</p><p></p><p>When the powerful members of the Ancient Clans discovered that their ancestors had appeared, the suppressing power of the Heavenly Dao suddenly disappeared from their bodies. Overjoyed, they hurriedly paid their respects to their own ancestors: "Greet the ancestors!"</p><p></p><p>The seven figures, however, did not pay attention to the Ancient Clan experts. After exchanging slight nods with each other, they turned to the two Heavenly Dao Lords and slightly cupped their hands in a simple greeting.</p><p></p><p>A graceful lady with a gentle smile asked, "May I ask what has happened, esteemed Heavenly Dao Lords?"</p><p></p><p>She was the ancestor of the Ancient Moon Blood Clan, Blood Moon Ru.</p><p></p><p>After Blood Moon Ru asked, the other six figures flashed a glance but did not speak.</p><p></p><p>At this time, the two Heavenly Dao Lord's illusory figures seemed to slightly bow, and one of them chuckled:</p><p></p><p>"Hehe, you seven, you should ask your own descendants about what has happened."</p><p></p><p>Hearing this, the seven people frowned slightly and looked towards the powerful members of the Ancient Clans.</p><p></p><p>The powerful members of the Ancient Clans, however, were already panicked by the friendly attitude their ancestors showed towards the Heavenly Dao Lords. An ominous premonition arose in their hearts!</p><p></p><p>It seems they had underestimated the Heavenly Dao Lords!</p><p></p><p>"Speak," said a bare-chested burly man in a calm tone.</p><p></p><p>He had a bald head and an extremely exaggerated muscular build, making it clear that he was the ancestor of the Ancient Saint Clan, Mang Tian.</p><p></p><p>"Ancestor, we eight clans only destroyed five Boundless Heavenly Dao at the Middle World level, but they also annihilated the Ancient Desolate Sword Clan... They actually demanded an explanation from us, and of course we were unwilling..." the clan leader of the Ancient Clans said cautiously and tremblingly.</p><p></p><p>Huh? The Ancient Desolate Sword Clan was destroyed? What about Sword Wuhui?</p><p></p><p>The seven figures' expressions showed slight surprise as they swept their gaze over, and indeed they did not see any powerful members of the Ancient Desolate Sword Clan.</p><p></p><p>"Insolence," Mang Tian growled. "Merely destroying five Boundless Heavenly Dao at the Middle World level? How dare you speak such arrogant words? Have you become so conceited from staying in this void for too long?"</p><p></p><p>The other six people also looked at them coldly.</p><p></p><p>They did not expect the Ancient Clan they left behind in the Eternal Vast Realm to have become like this. They must maintain face in front of the Heavenly Dao Lords, as it would not be wise to make enemies with them because of these Ancient Clans.</p><p></p><p>After all, the Ancient Clans left in this realm were not important to them. If not for the ancestral seals, they would have almost forgotten about them.</p><p></p><p>The powerful members of the Ancient Clans felt distressed and speechless. They never expected that after shattering the precious ancestral seals, the situation would turn out like this...</p><p></p><p>The ancestors were actually siding with the Heavenly Dao.</p><p></p><p>The seven figures looked at the clearly disgruntled powerful members of the Ancient Clans and shook their heads. The Ancient Clans they left behind were truly short-sighted and fearless in their ignorance.</p><p></p><p>The Heavenly Dao was not as simple as they thought.</p><p></p><p>Here is the full English translation of the Chinese excerpt:</p><p></p><p>Is it easy?</p><p></p><p>New 69 Book Bar 99sɥnx˙ɔoɯ</p><p></p><p>The middle-aged man in purple robes among the seven people looked at the powerful members of the ancient beast clan in the void, and then turned to the two Heavenly Dao Lords with a smile: "You two Heavenly Dao Lords, no matter how you look at it, these ancient clan members are also our juniors. Since we are taking action this time, how about we just let this matter slide?"</p><p></p><p>The two Heavenly Dao Lords seemed to exchange a glance, and then said, "Letting it slide is fine, we are naturally willing to give this face to the Purple Sky Emperor and the others. However, the five middle-world level Boundless Heavenly Dao cannot die in vain, so these ancient clans still need to pay a price."</p><p></p><p>Hearing this, the powerful members of the ancient clans were immediately filled with resentment. They never expected these two Heavenly Dao Lords to be so greedy, even after destroying the Ancient Desolate Sword Clan, they still want more?</p><p></p><p>Zi Xuan Yong's brow slightly furrowed as he asked, "You two Heavenly Dao Lords, please state what price the ancient clans need to pay."</p><p></p><p>As long as the price is not excessive, it would naturally be acceptable, but if the price is too much, then it would be a slap in their face!</p><p></p><p>Although they don't care much about these juniors, if it involves their own face, it would be a different matter.</p><p></p><p>"The price is very simple, we don't want the life of anyone from the ancient clans, we just want them to move out of this void, so that they won't be an eyesore," said one of the Heavenly Dao Lords in a calm tone.</p><p></p><p>The powerful members of the ancient clans immediately became unhappy upon hearing this!</p><p></p><p>If the Eternal Celestial Realm were to collapse, it would be understandable for them to move out, but the Eternal Celestial Realm is currently fine, so what right do they have to make them move?</p><p></p><p>They couldn't guarantee that they could find a better dwelling place than the Eternal Celestial Realm.</p><p></p><p>Moreover, the boundless void is too dangerous, who knows what dangers they might encounter, they have already been dominating this void for so long.</p><p></p><p>"This Emperor thinks it's acceptable," Zi Xuan Yong looked at the other six people, "What do you all think?"</p><p></p><p>In his eyes, as long as the Heavenly Dao Lords don't kill these ancient clan members, it would be giving them face, the rest doesn't matter.</p><p></p><p>The other six people also nodded in agreement.</p><p></p><p>Seeing this, the powerful members of the ancient clans were as if they had lost their ancestors. How come their thoughts are so different from theirs? Are these ancestors really their ancestors, or the ancestors of the Heavenly Dao?</p><p></p><p>But they couldn't disobey.</p><p></p><p>At the same time, far away at the edge of the Moon Star Realm, Lu Changsheng was a bit unhappy, silently standing up from the rocking chair.</p><p></p><p>He originally thought that just cleaning up the aftermath would be enough, but he never expected the thunderous sound to be so small, and they didn't even really fight.</p><p></p><p>Li Shuoyan was dazed and saw Lu Changsheng stand up, he also hurriedly stood up: "Master."</p><p></p><p>Lu Changsheng looked up at the sky and said indifferently, "You just stay here, I'll go deal with them."</p><p></p><p>"Yes." Li Shuoyan trembled inwardly and bowed.</p><p></p><p>When he raised his head, Lu Changsheng had already disappeared.</p><p></p><p>.........</p><p></p><p>The Eternal Celestial Realm was extremely quiet, and countless cultivators had excited expressions on their faces.</p><p></p><p>The ancient clans are moving out of the Eternal Celestial Realm?</p><p></p><p>That would be a huge blessing for them.</p><p></p><p>The Eternal Celestial Realm, if it were to lose the existence of the ancient clans, would definitely be renewed.</p><p></p><p>Just then, the voice of the Heavenly Dao Lords resounded in the sky again: "Well then, we shall take our leave now. As for the ancient clans, they have three months to completely evacuate this void."</p><p></p><p>"You two, have a safe journey." The voices of Zi Xuan Yong, Bai Tian, and Blood Moon Ru etc. followed.</p><p></p><p>However, in that instant, another magnetic voice rang out:</p><p></p><p>"I wonder what you all think, I disagree with the ancient clans moving out, and today they must be annihilated... all of them must be annihilated."</p><p></p><p>The heavens and earth fell silent for a moment, then an uproar arose.</p><p></p><p>Especially those like Gu Huang Xu Duan Jiu Xiong and Miao Han Tian who were familiar with this voice, they were all shocked!</p><p></p><p>Senior in blue robes!</p>

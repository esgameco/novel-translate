        <h1>Chapter 140</h1>
        <div class="content">
            <p>Here is the full English translation of the Chinese excerpt:</p><p></p><p>The Ancestral Celestial Realm. üí¢üê≥Ôºñ‚ûàùï§ùì±œÖùîÅ.ùêú·ªñ·ó∞‚ôî‚òÖ</p><p></p><p>At the end of the divine path.</p><p></p><p>Three figures were seated cross-legged in the air, and they suddenly opened their eyes simultaneously, looking at each other with puzzlement.</p><p></p><p>"Hmm? Could it be that those fellows have ascended the divine path again?"</p><p></p><p>A middle-aged man in armor frowned.</p><p></p><p>"In that case, the Yurning Demon Clan has failed? That shouldn't be the case, the peak combat power of the Yurning Demon Clan is far superior to the Five Great Immortal Realms," another young man said in a pensive tone.</p><p></p><p>The middle-aged man pursed his lips and said, "See if you can contact the Yurning Demon Clan and ask about the situation."</p><p></p><p>"Alright." The young man flipped his hand and took out a wooden tablet. He quickly drew something on it, but before the tablet could light up, it shattered with a 'crack'!</p><p></p><p>Seeing this, the three men raised their eyebrows!</p><p></p><p>Since the wooden tablet had shattered, it meant that the other party had perished.</p><p></p><p>"Hehe, it seems that it was indeed those fellows... I'm rather curious as to how they managed to counterattack and defeat the Yurning Demon Clan," the middle-aged man chuckled coldly.</p><p></p><p>"Could it be that turtle?" the young man asked.</p><p></p><p>"Definitely not, that turtle's defense is indeed extremely strong, but its attack methods are not enough to pose a significant threat to the Yurning Kings of the Yurning Demon Clan," the middle-aged man sneered.</p><p></p><p>"It seems that there is someone else, daring to go against our Ancestral Celestial Realm, truly not caring about their lives," he said.</p><p></p><p>At this moment, he suddenly looked towards the distant horizon and said, "The Sword Wielder of the Divine King's Hall has arrived!"</p><p></p><p>The other two were also slightly surprised and turned their heads to look.</p><p></p><p>Soon, an old man with a sword at his waist appeared before them.</p><p></p><p>The three men were slightly startled and quickly stood up to pay their respects: "Greetings, Sword Wielder!"</p><p></p><p>"You may rise," Lin Chuan nodded and directly said, "I have come here on the orders of the Wutian Divine King to inquire about the situation of the Five Great Immortal Realms."</p><p></p><p>On the orders of the Wutian Divine King!!</p><p></p><p>The three men looked at each other, not knowing why the Wutian Divine King would suddenly pay attention to the divine path, and with the three of them here, did the Wutian Divine King really worry that the Immortal Emperors of the Five Great Immortal Realms could ascend to the Ancestral Celestial Realm?</p><p></p><p>"You don't need to think too much about it. Just tell me the situation of the Five Great Immortal Realms," Lin Chuan frowned.</p><p></p><p>"Yes." The middle-aged man responded, then directly said, "Sword Wielder, we are not very clear about the current situation of the Five Great Immortal Realms, only knowing that the Yurning Demon Clan we sent should have failed..."</p><p></p><p>Lin Chuan's brows furrowed upon hearing this. He pondered and said, "Indeed, there seems to be some changes in the Four Immortal Realms."</p><p></p><p>The middle-aged man was puzzled. "What does the Sword Wielder mean?"</p><p></p><p>Lin Chuan sighed and said solemnly, "You, being here, are unaware that recently, a powerful fist energy from outside the Ancestral Celestial Realm has struck our Divine King's Hall, shattering it completely! The Wutian Divine King was also enraged by this."</p><p></p><p>"Sss‚Äî" The three were shocked.</p><p></p><p>Was there really such an earth-shattering event? A fist from outside the Ancestral Celestial Realm? Was this true or false? They found it hard to believe.</p><p></p><p>Moreover, their Divine King's Hall had become a laughingstock, as they had never heard of anyone's Divine King's Hall being destroyed before.</p><p></p><p>But what did this have to do with the Five Great Immortal Realms?</p><p></p><p>Seeing the three men's puzzlement, Lin Chuan shook his head and said, "That fist energy... came from the direction of the Four Immortal Realms, and when combined with the situation you just reported... it is highly likely related to the Five Great Immortal Realms."</p><p></p><p>The three fell silent.</p><p></p><p>Lin Chuan said, "In that case, you should guard this place well. I will return to report these matters directly to the Wutian Divine King, and then send more people over."</p><p></p><p>With that, Lin Chuan transformed into a sword energy and disappeared, not giving the three any time to react.</p><p></p><p>Uh...</p><p></p><p>"The Immortal Emperors may have ascended the divine path again..."</p><p></p><p>Here is the full English translation of the Chinese excerpt:</p><p></p><p>The middle-aged man was taken aback, and hurriedly said, "But Lin Chuan's figure is no longer in sight."</p><p></p><p>The middle-aged man was somewhat anxious, wanting to chase after him.</p><p></p><p>The young man called out, "Boss, given the speed of the Sword Cultivator, he's long gone, you won't be able to catch up."</p><p></p><p>The middle-aged man paused, let out a sigh, and turned to look at the Divine Path, his gaze gradually becoming more serious.</p><p></p><p>The other two young men saw this and asked puzzledly, "Boss, what's wrong?"</p><p></p><p>The middle-aged man shook his head and said solemnly, "According to what the Sword Cultivator said, that palm strike came from the Four Realms of Immortals. Connecting the recent events, the timeline also matches. So at this moment on the Divine Path... it's very likely that there are not only those few Immortal Emperors, but perhaps an unknown powerful expert as well."</p><p></p><p>"If that palm strike the Sword Cultivator mentioned was the work of this mysterious expert, then the three of us are in grave danger..."</p><p></p><p>"But... it shouldn't be, why would there be such a powerful expert in the Four Realms of Immortals? Doesn't the Heavenly Dao of the Four Realms govern this?"</p><p></p><p>What?!</p><p></p><p>The two young men's expressions changed.</p><p></p><p>"Boss, what should we do? If that's the case, are we just going to wait for death here?"</p><p></p><p>The middle-aged man pursed his lips, and a talisman appeared in his palm. He infused it with a thread of spiritual power, and the talisman instantly burned to ashes.</p><p></p><p>"Can't wait for the Sword Cultivator anymore, I've already sent a message to the Pavilion, hoping they'll send someone quickly."</p><p></p><p>"As for leaving this place, that's not an option. We have the mark of the Divine King's Pavilion, we can't escape."</p><p></p><p>The two young men's faces paled, and they grew increasingly anxious.</p><p></p><p>They had never imagined that one day they would be thrown into panic because of a person from the lower realm.</p><p></p><p>...</p><p></p><p>On the Divine Path, ten heavy stone gates appeared before Lu Changsheng and the others.</p><p></p><p>Nine of the gates were engraved with the character "death", while one was engraved with the character "life".</p><p></p><p>"This is the Nine Deaths, One Life Gate?"</p><p></p><p>Chu LingtiƒÅn and the others gazed at the ten stone gates, their eyes wandering over them, and they unconsciously began to make their choices.</p><p></p><p>"You all really chose already?" Lu Changsheng asked inexplicably.</p><p></p><p>"Ahem."</p><p></p><p>Chu LingtiƒÅn and the others immediately reacted, each clearing their throats to cover their embarrassment.</p><p></p><p>Lu Changsheng casually waved his sleeve, and the ten stone gates instantly vanished into nothingness. He continued to walk forward.</p><p></p><p>The others silently followed, and Lu Changsheng became increasingly unfathomable in their hearts.</p><p></p><p>That unyielding, unstoppable aura, as if nothing in the world could hinder him in the slightest.</p><p></p><p>Shi Wushi glanced at Lu Changsheng's back, smacked his lips, and cautiously said, "Old Turtle, just how powerful is the Immortal Emperor Changsheng? He's too formidable..."</p><p></p><p>The others nodded, deeply impressed.</p><p></p><p>The Old Turtle disdainfully glanced at them and said indifferently, "I, the Old Turtle, am already several times stronger than you all, let alone our Master."</p><p></p><p>Alright.</p><p></p><p>As time passed, a gate similar to the entrance of the Divine Path appeared before them.</p><p></p><p>Under Lu Changsheng's earth-shattering push, they had unknowingly reached the end, and Chu LingtiƒÅn and the others hadn't even had time to react before it was over.</p><p></p><p>Boom!</p><p></p><p>Lu Changsheng lightly punched the gate, and it shattered into pieces.</p><p></p><p>Thick spiritual energy surged in, and Chu LingtiƒÅn and the others felt refreshed, even the ancient Yin and Yang whose lifespan was limited were invigorated.</p><p></p><p>This was the feeling!</p><p></p><p>At this moment, a figure seated in the air in front of them suddenly stood up!</p><p></p><p>The middle-aged man's gaze shifted from the shattered gate to sweep over Chu LingtiƒÅn and the others, finally focusing on Lu Changsheng.</p><p></p><p>After a brief inspection, his pupils shrank slightly!</p>

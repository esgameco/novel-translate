        <h1>Chapter 391</h1>
        <div class="content">
            <p>Here is the full English translation of the Chinese excerpt:</p><p></p><p>The soul bodies by the Reincarnation Lake were soon dispersed by the old butler and other soul messengers.</p><p></p><p>After completing their task, the old butler and the other soul messengers hid in the distance, watching curiously without daring to approach.</p><p></p><p>At the same time, streams of light came rushing in from all directions - they were the Heavenly Dipper Seventy-Two Killings, the Earthly Dipper Thirty-Six Evils, and the Four Great Spiritual Generals of the Soul Emperor's Palace!</p><p></p><p>They took various forms, some with ox heads and horse faces, some decapitated, some with sharp fangs, some with completely white hair and gloomy expressions.</p><p></p><p>But each of them had an extremely chilling and powerful aura!</p><p></p><p>Especially the Four Great Spiritual Generals leading the group - their tall figures were wrapped in soul armor, exuding an awe-inspiring presence.</p><p></p><p>Since they wore fanged masks, their features and expressions could not be seen clearly.</p><p></p><p>"We pay our respects to the Soul Emperor, the Immortal Emperor!" </p><p></p><p>The high-ranking members of the soul realm knelt down respectfully.</p><p></p><p>At the same time, they were puzzled, not knowing why the Soul Emperor had summoned them to the Reincarnation Lake. Could it be that they had neglected their duties here and been caught by the Soul Emperor?</p><p></p><p>But that shouldn't be the case, as the Soul Emperor was too busy to bother with such minor matters.</p><p></p><p>As for the mysterious figure standing beside the Soul Emperor, they recognized him as Lü Changsheng, who could come and go freely in the soul realm and was treated with great courtesy and respect even by their superiors.</p><p></p><p>The Soul Emperor said indifferently, "Alright, all of you may rise. I have summoned you here today to seal a demonic figure in this Reincarnation Lake."</p><p></p><p>Seal a demonic figure in the Reincarnation Lake? What kind of demonic figure would require such a grand display?</p><p></p><p>The high-ranking members of the soul realm stood up, exchanging puzzled glances.</p><p></p><p>The Soul Emperor narrowed his eyes and said, "The Reincarnation Demon Child."</p><p></p><p>The Reincarnation Demon Child?!</p><p></p><p>The soul realm's high-ranking members were first puzzled for a moment, but then their expressions changed drastically.</p><p></p><p>It had been so long since they had heard that name...</p><p></p><p>"Your Majesty the Soul Emperor, has the Reincarnation Demon Child resurfaced?" </p><p></p><p>The lead Spiritual General asked solemnly.</p><p></p><p>The other high-ranking members of the soul realm were also shocked and doubtful, especially when they heard the Soul Emperor say he wanted to seal the Reincarnation Demon Child in the Reincarnation Lake... Could it be that the Soul Emperor had captured the Reincarnation Demon Child?</p><p></p><p>In their minds, the Soul Emperor was indeed very powerful, but to actually capture the Reincarnation Demon Child seemed a bit unrealistic.</p><p></p><p>The Soul Emperor waved his hand. "Enough, you don't need to ask further. Just put in your full effort when sealing him."</p><p></p><p>The Soul Emperor then looked at Lü Changsheng beside him and cupped his hands. "Immortal Emperor, I appreciate your help."</p><p></p><p>Lü Changsheng nodded, and in a flip of his hand, a multi-colored Dao Sealing Pagoda appeared in his palm.</p><p></p><p>He contemplated the small pagoda for a moment. If what the Soul Emperor said was true, then even if the Reincarnation Demon Child had previously been bound by chains, it would eventually break free.</p><p></p><p>Lü Changsheng had originally wanted to keep the Reincarnation Demon Child with him, but since the matter was so grave and the Soul Emperor was not at ease, he might as well suppress it in the soul realm.</p><p></p><p>Lü Changsheng didn't really mind either way, and was even glad to have less trouble.</p><p></p><p>"What kind of pagoda is this... I can faintly feel it trying to draw me in!"</p><p></p><p>"No wonder he is so respected by even the Soul Emperor, this treasure is extraordinary."</p><p></p><p>"..."</p><p></p><p>The high-ranking members of the soul realm exclaimed in awe as they examined the Dao Sealing Pagoda, their words full of flattery and deference.</p><p></p><p>Lü Changsheng's spiritual sense moved!</p><p></p><p>Quickly, a wisp of dark light shot out from the Dao Sealing Pagoda, transforming into a short, hideous-looking boy.</p><p></p><p>It was the Reincarnation Demon Child!!</p><p></p><p>"The Reincarnation Demon Child?!?!"</p><p></p><p>The high-ranking members' faces changed drastically, and they all involuntarily took a step back, staring at the Reincarnation Demon Child with terror and disbelief.</p><p></p><p>So it really was the Reincarnation Demon Child!</p><p></p><p>"Hehe, the soul realm..." </p><p></p><p>The Reincarnation Demon Child looked around.</p><p></p><p>Here is the full English translation of the Chinese excerpt:</p><p></p><p>All around, a sinister smile curled up on his lips, and then he glanced at Hunhui, finally fixing his gaze on Lu Changsheng:</p><p></p><p>"Big Boss, what do you mean by this?"</p><p></p><p>Lu Changsheng did not answer, but instead scrutinized him, and suddenly said, "You've been pretending all along... right?"</p><p></p><p>The Reincarnation Demon Child's eyes flickered, and he also did not answer, but instead asked self-assuredly, "Big Boss, have you brought me to the Ghost Realm to suppress me again?"</p><p></p><p>Lu Changsheng's expression was blank: "What do you think?"</p><p></p><p>The Reincarnation Demon Child first swept his gaze across the high-ranking members of the Ghost Realm, then paused for a moment on Hunhui, before shifting his vision and looking deeply at Lu Changsheng, speaking words that left everyone utterly perplexed!</p><p></p><p>"Big Boss, if you want to suppress me, then go ahead and suppress me. I'll fully cooperate."</p><p></p><p>Hunhui and the high-ranking members of the Ghost Realm's eyes flashed with a heavy gaze, their expressions slightly doubtful!</p><p></p><p>To be honest, they had already secretly prepared their stance, and as soon as the Reincarnation Demon Child showed any signs of resistance, they would act immediately!</p><p></p><p>But what did they hear?</p><p></p><p>The Reincarnation Demon Child actually did not resist??</p><p></p><p>Lu Changsheng softly said, "Won't you resist at all?"</p><p></p><p>The Reincarnation Demon Child bared his teeth in a chilling smile: "What's the point of resisting? My current strength is definitely no match for Big Boss and the Ghost Emperor's grasp, so it's better to fully cooperate and suffer less."</p><p></p><p>"Besides, I've been getting tired of staying in the Great Dao Demon Suppression Tower, so it would be a great choice to stay in a different environment for a while..."</p><p></p><p>Hearing this, Lu Changsheng's brow furrowed slightly, as he looked deeply at the Reincarnation Demon Child, his gaze pondering something.</p><p></p><p>"Immortal Emperor Changsheng, there's no time to waste, let's begin?" </p><p></p><p>At this moment, Hunhui spoke in a deep voice, although he didn't know what the Reincarnation Demon Child was up to, but since he wasn't resisting, that would naturally be the best. Originally, he thought it would take a lot of effort, but now that it's like this, it's better to seal him away as soon as possible, lest nightmares arise.</p><p></p><p>"Mm." Lu Changsheng nodded slightly, looking at the Reincarnation Demon Child, and said, "Then you go down to the Rebirth Lake yourself."</p><p></p><p>Upon hearing this, the Reincarnation Demon Child slowly walked to the edge of the lake, his back facing Lu Changsheng and the others.</p><p></p><p>Suddenly, the Reincarnation Demon Child slowly turned around, looking at Lu Changsheng, and said, "Big Boss, do you think there's a chance we'll see each other again?"</p><p></p><p>Hearing this, the ever-vigilant Hunhui and the high-ranking members' gazes sharpened!</p><p></p><p>Lu Changsheng calmly looked at the Reincarnation Demon Child, and said meaningfully, "The possibility exists, but it's not high."</p><p></p><p>The Reincarnation Demon Child nodded, smiled, but the smile was extremely unsettling, and ordinary people who saw it would probably be scared to death.</p><p></p><p>The Reincarnation Demon Child turned around, leaped into the Rebirth Lake, and with a splash, he disappeared without a trace.</p><p></p><p>"Now, seal him!!"</p><p></p><p>Hunhui roared.</p><p></p><p>"Yes!" The high-ranking members immediately responded.</p><p></p><p>"Immortal Emperor Changsheng, we are grateful for your help." As Hunhui's hands began to move, he turned his head to seek assistance.</p><p></p><p>"Mm."</p><p></p><p>Lu Changsheng's gaze remained calm, his two fingers joined at his chest, and a fierce sword intent gradually began to swirl at the fingertips!</p><p></p><p>At the same time, the entire Rebirth Lake erupted in a dazzling green light, this was the natural restraining formation within the Rebirth Lake that Hunhui had mentioned, activating.</p><p></p><p>The Heavenly Dipper Seventy-Two Calamities, the Earthly Dipper Thirty-Six Evils, and the Four Great Demonic Generals also unleashed their might at the same moment!</p><p></p><p>This vast power, combined with the increasingly fierce sword intent emanating from Lu Changsheng's fingertips, caused the entire Ghost Realm's souls to tremble in fear!</p><p></p><p>The previously tranquil Rebirth Lake also erupted into towering waves at this moment!</p>

        <h1>Chapter 71</h1>
        <div class="content">
            <p>Here is the full English translation of the Chinese excerpt:</p><p></p><p>"Big Dao, you and the butler are still chatting. Since it's still early, let's set off quickly," a woman's voice came from the carriage behind.</p><p></p><p>"Oh, okay!" Chen Dadao snapped out of it, ordered the coachman, then sat down with the butler and pulled down the curtain as the carriage slowly started moving.</p><p></p><p>Just then, a melodious female voice and hurried footsteps sounded outside.</p><p></p><p>Chen Dadao was taken aback, immediately shouting, "Stop!"</p><p></p><p>The carriage came to a halt.</p><p></p><p>Chen Dadao lifted the curtain and saw a strange woman standing by the carriage, panting as she clutched her knees, looking at him anxiously.</p><p></p><p>"Dadao, who is this girl?!" came the irritated voice of Chen Dadao's wife from the carriage behind.</p><p></p><p>"Ah, madam, this is a local resident of the town. She might not have attended the recent sendoff ceremony and has come to see us off today. Isn't that right, butler?" Chen Dadao hastily made an excuse.</p><p></p><p>The butler quickly agreed, "Yes, yes, yes!"</p><p></p><p>Hearing this, the woman in the carriage behind pulled the curtain shut and fell silent.</p><p></p><p>Chen Dadao heaved a sigh of relief, then asked the woman puzzledly, "Miss, who are you?"</p><p></p><p>The woman composed herself, occasionally glancing at the carriage behind, then said cautiously, "Lord Zhen, are you... leaving Moyu Town?"</p><p></p><p>Little Tong had brought some fruits to sell in Moyu Town today and happened to hear that the Lord Zhen was being relieved of his post. She had hurried to the town gate to wait for him.</p><p></p><p>Chen Dadao and the butler exchanged a look, then he smiled and said, "That's right, miss. Do you have something to say?"</p><p></p><p>Little Tong bit her lip and said hoarsely, "May I... see my brother?"</p><p></p><p>Brother?</p><p></p><p>Chen Dadao and the butler were puzzled. What brother? This woman couldn't be quite right in the head...</p><p></p><p>"Uh, miss, I really don't know who this brother of yours is. If you have nothing else, then we'll be on our way," Chen Dadao said with a forced smile, about to lower the curtain, as he didn't have much time to spare.</p><p></p><p>Little Tong urgently said, "Lord Zhen, it's your son!"</p><p></p><p>Before the bewildered Chen Dadao and butler could respond, an angry voice came from the carriage behind.</p><p></p><p>"Chen Dadao! When and where did you have a son with some vixen? If you don't give an explanation today, I'll kill myself right here!"</p><p></p><p>Chen Dadao panicked, glaring angrily at Little Tong, then frantically signaled to the old butler.</p><p></p><p>The old butler understood, turning back and solemnly stating, "The master has always been upright. This servant can vouch for the master with his life."</p><p></p><p>"Hmph." A cold snort came from the carriage, and no more sounds were heard.</p><p></p><p>Chen Dadao sighed heavily, wiping the sweat from his brow, and finally began to feel impatient with the strange woman in front of him.</p><p></p><p>Anyone would be in a terrible mood after being so disrupted.</p><p></p><p>He had almost been driven to the brink of divorce because of this!</p><p></p><p>"Miss, as you can see, I have no son. I must take my leave."</p><p></p><p>Chen Dadao lowered the curtain and commanded, "Depart!"</p><p></p><p>Little Tong's eyes reddened. Not knowing when she would see him again, she gathered her courage and cupped her hands around her mouth, shouting, "Yes, there is! Three years ago, when Moyu Town was plagued by demonic beasts, my brother took me to a courtyard in the Lord Zhen's residence. He was wearing blue robes, and I clearly remember his warm smile that thawed my heart in that cold winter!"</p><p></p><p>"Stop!!!"</p><p></p><p>Chen Dadao's expression changed, and he suddenly waved his hand.</p><p></p><p>The coachman pulled the reins, and the horses reared up, coming to a halt.</p><p></p><p>Seeing the carriage stop, Little Tong immediately felt relieved and ran over.</p><p></p><p>"Dadao, what are you-"</p><p></p><p>"Shut up!" Chen Dadao cut off the impatient words of the woman in the carriage with a stern face.</p><p></p><p>Here is the full English translation of the Chinese excerpt:</p><p></p><p>After that, Chen Dadao got off the carriage and looked at the young woman in front of him, smiling a little dryly, "Miss, there are some things that shouldn't be said in the future, that's the master's..."</p><p></p><p>Xiaotong's gaze was confused, wanting to say something, but Chen Dadao continued, "The master left Moyu Town half a month ago..."</p><p></p><p>Xiaotong's body trembled, her mouth slightly open, but her throat seemed to be blocked by a foreign object, and she couldn't speak.</p><p></p><p>Eight years ago, that young man had bought her two baskets of red fruits for fifteen copper coins.</p><p></p><p>Three years ago, he had bought her two baskets of winter jujubes with a precious silver coin.</p><p></p><p>Over the years, she and her grandmother had lived together as usual, and she had become more successful, going from bitterness to sweetness, passing the exam to become a minor official in the capital, just waiting for the appointment letter.</p><p></p><p>She gradually understood what it meant to "first be sour, then be sweet."</p><p></p><p>"I, I understand..." Xiaotong said softly, lowering her head.</p><p></p><p>Chen Dadao sighed and then smiled again: "Hehe, Miss, the master is not an ordinary person, let me tell you, the master is a celestial being who roams the world."</p><p></p><p>Xiaotong's pupils contracted. No wonder, after so many years, every time she saw him, his appearance never changed.</p><p></p><p>The next moment, she looked up.</p><p></p><p>"Go!" Chen Dadao had somehow already gotten back on the carriage and set off again.</p><p></p><p>"Can the lord of the town tell me the master's name!" Xiaotong called out hopefully.</p><p></p><p>In eight years, she had seen him three times, and the information she knew was very limited.</p><p></p><p>"The master's name is Lu Changsheng."</p><p></p><p>The carriage gradually moved farther away, leaving only Xiaotong standing there like a wooden stake, murmuring, "So the master's name is Lu Changsheng..."</p><p></p><p>She opened her palm, in which she had been tightly gripping the silver coin...</p><p></p><p>After the incident of the fifteen copper coins eight years ago, she had never dared to tell her grandmother about the silver coin three years ago, and she hadn't used it much either. She had originally wanted to return it to the master today, but it was too late.</p><p></p><p>...........</p><p></p><p>Tianrun Trading Company.</p><p></p><p>"Eh, Helin, why does this restaurant only have a plaque without a name?" The old turtle glanced over and asked curiously.</p><p></p><p>Gu Helin respectfully looked at Lu Changsheng and then smiled, "Yes, senior, this restaurant is very special, it has no name, and this is an interesting thing in the entire Lingchen Cultivation World. The hidden owner of this restaurant has declared that if anyone can help name the restaurant, she will provide a peerless good wine for that person to drink."</p><p></p><p>The old turtle heard this and became suspicious, "Didn't you tell the owner that there's good wine to drink here? What's the deal, do you want the owner to personally write the name or something? Dream on!"</p><p></p><p>Gu Helin choked for a moment, panicking, "How could Helin dare to do that, of course the good wine here is for sale, but that peerless good wine is different, it requires naming the restaurant..."</p><p></p><p>As for how peerless that good wine is, Helin doesn't know, after all, no one has succeeded in naming it before.</p><p></p><p>At the end, Gu Helin muttered softly.</p><p></p><p>"Bullshit, naming it is just a simple matter, who can't do it? Old Turtle can do it too! It's decided, it'll be called Turtle Grandpa Restaurant! The owner of this restaurant has to agree, whether they like it or not!"</p><p></p><p>The old turtle snorted coldly, sounding quite tyrannical.</p><p></p><p>"Ahem."</p><p></p><p>Lu Changsheng suddenly coughed lightly.</p><p></p><p>The old turtle reacted and his expression changed, quickly squeezing out a chrysanthemum-like smile and flattering, "Uh... no, no, it should be called Life Master Restaurant, haha, right, owner?"</p><p></p><p>Slap!</p><p></p><p>Lu Changsheng lightly slapped the old turtle on the head, sending him spinning dizzily like a top, seeing stars in front of his eyes, until he finally stabilized himself by grabbing onto Gu Helin next to him.</p><p></p><p>Lu Changsheng looked at the plaque silently and said, "Continue."</p><p></p><p>Gu Helin was so scared that his legs were shaking, he swallowed and said, "What the Turtle Senior said is not bad, it's true that naming it is something anyone can do... but, but all this time, no one has been able to successfully carve the characters onto the plaque... It's not that the naming is difficult, but that plaque is extremely strange."</p><p></p><p>Lu Changsheng stood with his hands behind his back, looking at the plaque, silent.</p>

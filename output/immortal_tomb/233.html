        <h1>Chapter 233</h1>
        <div class="content">
            <p>Here is the full English translation of the Chinese excerpt:</p><p></p><p>Su Lianyi and the other person were slightly stunned. ‚ôò‚ôû‚ûÖ‚ûà≈üùêáùî≤ùìß.‚í∏ÔºØ–ºüçÆüéÑ</p><p></p><p>What did this little medicine boy call them?</p><p></p><p>Fellow Daoists?</p><p></p><p>They couldn't help but start to examine the boy's bearing, and soon, they were both shocked.</p><p></p><p>This handsome little medicine boy was actually a cultivator, which wasn't too surprising...</p><p></p><p>What surprised them was that, according to their perception, this little medicine boy's aura was extremely obscure... they couldn't see through it at all?</p><p></p><p>There could only be two possibilities - either his cultivation method or some treasure was concealing his true state, or he was at a higher cultivation level than them.</p><p></p><p>The latter possibility was subconsciously excluded by them, after all, in this remote Yanwu Town, the chance of that was too small.</p><p></p><p>Moreover, this little medicine boy had a youthful appearance and seemed rather carefree.</p><p></p><p>However, they still felt a bit wary. In their cultivation world, when out and about, they were most afraid of being looked down upon.</p><p></p><p>If they weren't careful, their entire cultivation could be ruined in an instant.</p><p></p><p>As Su Lianyi and Xu Jiao were furrowing their brows in thought, the little medicine boy, Tongxin, couldn't help but feel a bit smug.</p><p></p><p>Haha, I'm the holy son of the Xiaoyao Sect, alright?</p><p></p><p>How could a Golden Immortal and a Great Dao Immortal see through me?</p><p></p><p>Su Lianyi's eyes flickered, and she smiled softly as she cupped her hands: "Fellow Daoist, we're not here to seek medical treatment, but to take Little Tong back with us."</p><p></p><p>What illnesses could cultivators have? Even if there were cultivation errors, outsiders couldn't interfere with that - everyone in the Ancestral Heaven Realm knew this.</p><p></p><p>Take Little Tong back?</p><p></p><p>Tongxin was stunned for a moment.</p><p></p><p>Little Tong was also taken aback, and asked with a confused expression, "Where are you two sisters taking me?"</p><p></p><p>Xu Jiao patted Little Tong's head, "Little Tong, we're taking you to our Shangqing Palace to cultivate. Aren't you happy to be able to cultivate the Dao?"</p><p></p><p>At the same time, </p><p></p><p>In a magnificent place in the Ancestral Heaven Realm,</p><p></p><p>A middle-aged man sitting in meditation was suddenly troubled...</p><p></p><p>He had a robust build, with scars criss-crossing his cheeks, and a bit of stubble on his chin. After a moment, he opened his eyes, his weary gaze filled with bewilderment.</p><p></p><p>"What's going on...?"</p><p></p><p>"Could it be that something has happened to Tong'er?" The middle-aged man's eyes grew anxious, and he abruptly stood up. "I have to go check on Tong'er's main body."</p><p></p><p>He suddenly noticed the small insect at his feet, and his heart immediately raced. He quickly moved his foot away.</p><p></p><p>"Phew."</p><p></p><p>If he had accidentally stepped on it... this little bug might have been Tong'er in the midst of traversing the eons, and he would have crushed her.</p><p></p><p>Many things are truly unpredictable.</p><p></p><p>&lt;tt_keyword_ad data-title="Educational Training" data-tag="Recommended Products" data-type="1" data-value="1910"&gt;&lt;/tt_keyword_ad&gt;</p><p></p><p>.........</p><p></p><p>In the medical hall, Little Tong's eyes lit up!</p><p></p><p>Su Lianyi and Xu Jiao were delighted to see this, knowing that no ordinary person could resist the allure of cultivation.</p><p></p><p>But soon, they saw the light in Little Tong's eyes dim, and she softly said, "Sisters, Little Tong doesn't want to cultivate the Dao. Little Tong only wants to be a medicine boy for the Master here."</p><p></p><p>"Why??" Su Lianyi and Xu Jiao asked in unison, their brows furrowing as they couldn't understand.</p><p></p><p>Just now, they had clearly seen the longing in Little Tong's eyes, but now it had suddenly...</p><p></p><p>In this world, who could resist the temptation of cultivation?</p><p></p><p>Immortality aside, as that was too remote, even unattainable, but being able to fly through the skies and travel freely - wasn't that exhilarating? And the increase in lifespan - wasn't that wonderful?</p><p></p><p>Little Tong didn't speak further, her eyes only filled with an apology towards the two women.</p><p></p><p>Of course she wanted to cultivate.</p><p></p><p>But compared to cultivation, she wanted to learn medicine more.</p><p></p><p>... From childhood, the grandparents and aunts and uncles in Yanwu Town had all been kind to her, and without them, she might have starved to death long ago.</p><p></p><p>A few years ago, Little Li, the son of Uncle Li, had fallen gravely ill with a severe cold, and had passed away on the way to seek treatment.</p><p></p><p>Here is the full English translation of the Chinese excerpt:</p><p></p><p>The very next day, she saw that Uncle Li's hair had all turned white.</p><p></p><p>Uncle Li, filled with self-blame, guilt, heartache, and a desire to die, has been living in deep sorrow ever since. She could see all of this clearly.</p><p></p><p>The Master was no ordinary person, and would eventually leave Yun Yu. </p><p></p><p>Although she was young, she actually understood this in her heart.</p><p></p><p>These past few days, she had also realized the purpose behind the Master teaching her medical skills.</p><p></p><p>So, she just wanted to seize the opportunity while the Master was still here, to thoroughly learn the medical arts. That way, even if the Master were to leave, the calamitous events would not happen again in Yun Yu Town.</p><p></p><p>Moreover, she had just joined the medical house, and the Master had already cured her congenital defect. The Master had done her a great kindness, so she could not possibly leave.</p><p></p><p>Regardless of her grandfather, grandmother, uncle, and aunt, or the Master, she could not be ungrateful.</p><p></p><p>Su Lianyi asked in a calm voice, "Xiao Tong, cultivating immortality can prolong one's lifespan. Given your talent, why limit yourself to the meager hundred years of a mortal life? And not to mention that, don't you want to fly through the heavens, slay demons, and eliminate evil?"</p><p></p><p>Xiao Tong slightly parted her mouth, but at this moment, she seemed to have reverted to being a mute.</p><p></p><p>The onlooking Tongxin was also somewhat at a loss for words. He looked at Xiao Tong, unable to understand what was going through this young girl's mind, that she could resist the temptation of cultivating immortality... This was quite extraordinary, surpassing even his own childlike innocence.</p><p></p><p>But what could be the reason? Could it be a fear of heights??</p><p></p><p>Tongxin was utterly perplexed.</p><p></p><p>However, he felt relieved in his heart.</p><p></p><p>Xu Jiao finally grew impatient and said indifferently, "Xiao Tong, the Holy Lady has already spoken thus, and you still don't want to cultivate immortality? Do you know what a great loss it would be for you, with your constitution, if you don't cultivate?"</p><p></p><p>Seeing Xiao Tong at a loss for words but still silent, Su Lianyi said calmly, "Xiao Tong, we cannot just watch you self-destruct like this. This immortal cultivation... you must do it, whether you want to or not. We can only forcibly take you back. Afterwards, you will thank your sister."</p><p></p><p>After saying this, she took a step forward.</p><p></p><p>Xiao Tong became flustered and shrank back.</p><p></p><p>At this moment, Tongxin's eyes flashed, and he stood in front of Su Lianyi, smiling, "If you two are not here to seek medical treatment, then please take your leave."</p><p></p><p>Su Lianyi paused, about to say something, but Xu Jiao could no longer hold back, glaring at Tongxin and growling, "Fellow Daoist, since you are a cultivator, you should understand that our Holy Lady is doing this for Xiao Tong's own good. No matter what, cultivating immortality is better than being a medicine boy in this dilapidated medical house!"</p><p></p><p>Tongxin's smile immediately vanished, and his fists clenched tightly...</p><p></p><p>Clang!!!</p><p></p><p>At this moment, a sword's cry suddenly rang out near their ears!</p><p></p><p>In the next instant, a sharp sword energy swept past!</p><p></p><p>Shing shing shing shing‚Äî</p><p></p><p>"Ah!"</p><p></p><p>Accompanied by a miserable wail.</p><p></p><p>Xu Jiao's limbs were suddenly severed from her body! Blood sprayed everywhere!</p><p></p><p>"Holy... Holy Lady, save me."</p><p></p><p>Xu Jiao's fearful voice sounded out as the sword energy dissipated.</p><p></p><p>Su Lianyi snapped out of her daze, looking at the bloody Xu Jiao, who had become a human torso on the ground, her pupils contracting violently.</p><p></p><p>Tongxin swallowed hard, his throat somewhat dry.</p><p></p><p>As for Xiao Tong, she had been subjected to a spell by Tongxin the moment the sword's cry rang out, and now her eyes were completely blinded, seeing nothing but darkness.</p><p></p><p>Tap tap tap...</p><p></p><p>Footsteps approached, and Luchang Sheng parted the curtain from the inner room and walked out.</p><p></p><p>He looked calmly at the ground where Xu Jiao lay, and said softly, "A dilapidated medical house? This time, I won't bother with you. But if there is a next time..."</p><p></p><p>Su Lianyi looked at the unfamiliar young man in green, her gaze shrinking in fear!</p><p></p><p>This remote Yun Yu Town actually had such a powerful expert hidden away!</p><p></p><p>This young man in green had such a ruthless heart... </p><p>To have mutilated Xu Jiao into a human torso, and then end with "I won't bother"...</p><p></p><p>What a "not bothering"!</p><p></p><p>Su Lianyi swallowed hard, forcibly suppressing the anxiety in her heart, and closed her eyes to pay respects: "Thank you, senior, for your restraint. It was our mistake, and we have been presumptuous."</p><p></p><p>After saying this, she waved her hand, and Xu Jiao's body and severed limbs began to float, ready to flee.</p><p></p><p>"Hold on."</p><p></p><p>Luchang Sheng suddenly said,</p><p></p><p>"Clean up my medical house before you leave."</p>

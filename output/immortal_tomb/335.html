        <h1>Chapter 335</h1>
        <div class="content">
            <p>Here is the full English translation of the Chinese excerpt:</p><p></p><p>Just three breaths later, Peng Fang, Zuo Shan, and Zhao Wuyou appeared in the main hall.</p><p></p><p>They looked at the scene before them, first stunned, then a surge of anger rose in their eyes!</p><p></p><p>Su Qianghe was tightly gripped by the elder, unable to resist.</p><p></p><p>He was only at the late-stage Spirit Origin Realm, facing an elder at the late-stage Spirit Storage Realm, the two realms were vastly different, like a lamb awaiting slaughter. In the face of such overwhelming power, even his mastery of the Carefree Techniques could not make up for the gap.</p><p></p><p>Moreover, he had only just begun to cultivate the third volume of the Carefree Techniques, and had not even fully comprehended it yet.</p><p></p><p>"Attack!!" Peng Fang let out a low roar and charged forward without hesitation!</p><p></p><p>At a time like this, there was no need for further discussion - the other side had already dared to make a move within their Carefree Sect, so any more words would be laughable.</p><p></p><p>Boom! Violent spiritual energy suddenly erupted in the main hall - a late-stage Spirit Sun Realm, an early-stage Spirit Sun Realm, and two late-stage Spirit Origin Realms.</p><p></p><p>Peng Fang and the others had been suppressed in the Linglong Heavenly Realm for too long, and upon breaking through, they surged forward like a raging flood.</p><p></p><p>Their cultivation had reached a terrifying level in just over ten thousand years.</p><p></p><p>Of course, the key was the existence of the Carefree Techniques, without which they would not have been able to advance so rapidly. Li Shuyan's natural talent was not weak, but he had only reached the peak of the late-stage Spirit Sun Realm.</p><p></p><p>"Hehe, how bold!" The elder of the Crimson Yang Palace was momentarily taken aback, then laughed. The Carefree Sect really had no fear of death, so today he would teach them a lesson, and he must get his hands on that movement technique of theirs.</p><p></p><p>Rumble, rumble, soon Peng Fang and the others were engaged in battle with the Crimson Yang Palace group in the main hall!</p><p></p><p>The hall shook violently, but surprisingly, it only swayed and showed no signs of collapsing.</p><p></p><p>The young disciples of the Crimson Yang Palace were instantly reduced to severe injuries, lying there barely clinging to life.</p><p></p><p>Only two middle-aged executives were still gritting their teeth to hold on, but they soon coughed up a mouthful of fresh blood and were sent flying!</p><p></p><p>Peng Fang's figure flashed, and he grabbed the necks of the two middle-aged men, coldly staring at the elder of the Crimson Yang Palace.</p><p></p><p>In just a moment, in the main hall, the Crimson Yang Palace side only had the elder standing unharmed, still gripping Su Qianghe, but he was stunned.</p><p></p><p>He hadn't even recovered when his two executives were already captured alive.</p><p></p><p>Impossible, the two executives were at the late-stage Spirit Sun Realm, how could they not handle a late-stage and an early-stage Spirit Sun Realm?</p><p></p><p>As for the other two late-stage Spirit Origin Realm elders, he didn't even want to consider them.</p><p></p><p>"Still not letting go of our sect elder?" Peng Fang said, holding one man in each hand and staring at the Crimson Yang Palace elder.</p><p></p><p>The elder's eyes flickered, temporarily not showing any intention of releasing Su Qianghe in his grasp.</p><p></p><p>He was clear in his heart that if he really let go, it would be difficult for the Crimson Yang Palace people to leave the Carefree Sect today.</p><p></p><p>He was puzzled, why did the fat man in the late-stage Spirit Sun Realm give him a sense of danger!</p><p></p><p>And the commotion here should have been heard, so more and more people from the Carefree Sect were likely to come this way.</p><p></p><p>"Grand Elder, save us..." The two middle-aged men cried out in agony, as they felt the grip on their necks tightening, and if it continued, their necks would be snapped.</p><p></p><p>"Grand Elder, don't bother with me, kill those two and then keep all the Crimson Yang Palace people here! I, a mere Spirit Origin Realm, am worth exchanging for them!" Su Qianghe shouted, his face flushed red.</p><p></p><p>Peng Fang seemed to have not heard, and said indifferently, "Are you sure you won't let go of our sect elder?"</p><p></p><p>The elder hesitated for a moment, then sneered, "Do you think this elder is a fool? If I let him go, you'll all pounce on me, won't you..."</p><p></p><p>"This elder is determined not to let you make a move today, hehe."</p><p></p><p>Hearing this, Peng Fang's pupils contracted slightly. Of course, he wouldn't let Su Qianghe die just like that.</p><p></p><p>Zuo Shan and the others also had anxious expressions on their faces.</p><p></p><p>"Grand Elder, just attack directly, I, Su Qianghe..."</p><p></p><p>Here is the full English translation of the Chinese excerpt:</p><p></p><p>"I've never been afraid of death!" Suqianghe gritted his teeth and said.</p><p></p><p>Boom!</p><p></p><p>But just as he finished speaking, the elder struck him in the abdomen with a punch and coldly said, "You seem to have a lot to say..."</p><p></p><p>Suqianghe's face turned deathly pale and he immediately wilted.</p><p></p><p>Shua!!!</p><p></p><p>At the same time, Peng Fang also twisted the arms of the two attendants of the Chiyang Palace!</p><p></p><p>"Ah!"</p><p></p><p>The two middle-aged attendants immediately let out a painful, agonizing scream!</p><p></p><p>"If you dare to touch my Sect Elder again..." Peng Fang glared fiercely at the elder of the Chiyang Palace.</p><p></p><p>"Enough, don't talk nonsense. This Elder knows you don't dare. Now let's go outside the Xiaoyao Sect, and then we'll exchange hostages."</p><p></p><p>The elder of the Chiyang Palace sneered and said, as he grabbed Suqianghe and walked out of the main hall.</p><p></p><p>Of course, he wasn't stupid. How could he possibly exchange two late-stage Spirit Yang Realm attendants for the life of a mere late-stage Spirit Element Realm like Suqianghe?</p><p></p><p>In the Chiyang Palace, the late-stage Spirit Yang Realm was already considered a core combat force.</p><p></p><p>Seeing this, the young disciples of the Chiyang Palace hurriedly got up from the ground and followed their Elder, their faces looking somewhat unsightly.</p><p></p><p>They couldn't believe the Chiyang Palace had been humiliated by this unknown Xiaoyao Sect today!</p><p></p><p>"Let's go!" </p><p></p><p>Peng Fang's face looked grim as he grabbed the two middle-aged attendants and quickly chased after them.</p><p></p><p>Left Choushan and the others exchanged a glance and sighed, silently following behind.</p><p></p><p>They knew that the Xiaoyao Sect was a hegemon-level sect in the Linglang Heavens, but now that they had come to this Spirit-Demon Battlefield... being bullied by any random sect was truly humiliating.</p><p></p><p>Through today's events, they truly experienced the terror and oppression of the Spirit-Demon Battlefield, and this was still within the human domain... </p><p></p><p>It was unimaginable how powerful the other races must be outside the human domain.</p><p></p><p>...</p><p></p><p>At this moment, the entire Xiaoyao Sect was in an uproar!</p><p></p><p>Almost all the attendants, protectors, and disciples closely followed the elder of the Chiyang Palace as he retreated.</p><p></p><p>Seeing the elder of the Chiyang Palace holding the Third Elder Suqianghe, the attendants and disciples' eyes were burning with fury!</p><p></p><p>Tongxin and Lin Dong had also hurried over upon hearing the commotion. They looked at this scene in disbelief.</p><p></p><p>The sense of urgency to grow stronger surged even stronger in their hearts!</p><p></p><p>They also deeply realized that this was no longer the Linglang Heavens!</p><p></p><p>Soon, they arrived outside the gates of the Xiaoyao Sect.</p><p></p><p>A sea of people.</p><p></p><p>The two disciples guarding the mountain gate looked bewildered at the scene.</p><p></p><p>"Alright, we've arrived outside the mountain gate, let's exchange the hostages." Peng Fang said coldly.</p><p></p><p>"This Elder will count to three, and we'll simultaneously throw the hostages towards each other..." The elder of the Chiyang Palace sneered, his eyes flickering as he said, "One... two..."</p><p></p><p>"Three!"</p><p></p><p>As soon as he finished speaking, he suddenly lifted Suqianghe in a feint motion!</p><p></p><p>But Peng Fang had already thrown the two attendants over!</p><p></p><p>The elder was delighted, and with his fastest speed, he pushed the two middle-aged attendants back into the hands of the Chiyang Palace people.</p><p></p><p>The Xiaoyao Sect members were shocked, their faces flushing red with indignation - what a despicable and shameless act!</p><p></p><p>Peng Fang and the other elders also had extremely unsightly expressions on their faces at this moment.</p><p></p><p>"Hahaha! You Xiaoyao Sect, just wait for the arrival of our Chiyang Palace!" The elder of the Chiyang Palace said arrogantly, grabbing the barely conscious Suqianghe and preparing to retreat with the others.</p><p></p><p>Peng Fang and the others' faces changed, and they hurriedly stepped forward. Suqianghe could not be allowed to be taken away today, or it would be almost certain death for him!</p><p></p><p>Bang!</p><p></p><p>But at this moment, the Chiyang Palace people were suddenly violently repelled by the space!</p><p></p><p>Peng Fang and the others paused, and the Xiaoyao Sect members looked around in bewilderment.</p><p></p><p>As for the elder of the Chiyang Palace, his face had already turned as gloomy as water, and the middle-aged attendants and disciples were even paler.</p><p></p><p>"Does my Xiaoyao Sect seem like a place you can come and go as you please?" </p><p></p><p>In the next moment, a figure in blue robes appeared like a ghost.</p>

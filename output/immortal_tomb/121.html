        <h1>Chapter 121</h1>
        <div class="content">
            <p>Here is the full English translation of the Chinese excerpt:</p><p></p><p>This place is quiet, </p><p></p><p>The old butler and the other soul guards kneel on the ground, daring not to move, while only the countless wandering souls continue to roam around. üë∫‚úä‚ûÖ‚ùæ≈ûÔº®·ëå·ô≠.·ëïœåùìúüéÄüëå</p><p></p><p>Lu Changsheng stepped forward, extending his right hand to help the kneeling soul guard up, and said with a gentle smile,</p><p></p><p>"It's not that I've surpassed you in the past, but you, after a hundred thousand years, it seems you haven't slacked off, and your strength has improved, not bad."</p><p></p><p>The old turtle beside him heard this and raised his eyebrows, looking at the soul guard in surprise, wondering how he didn't notice the improvement in the soul guard's strength.</p><p></p><p>The soul guard straightened up, burly and strong, even though Lu Changsheng's figure was tall, he only reached the soul guard's shoulder.</p><p></p><p>As for the old turtle with his hunched back, he was even shorter, only reaching the soul guard's waist.</p><p></p><p>"The Immortal Emperor Changsheng's eyesight is sharp, he can see through the soul guard with just a glance."</p><p></p><p>The soul guard turned his head aside, smiling awkwardly, as his height was too great, if he were to face Lu Changsheng directly, it would be a scene of looking down, which would be somewhat disrespectful.</p><p></p><p>At this time, the old turtle sneered impatiently, "Soul guard, you're too lacking in courtesy, aren't you? You just let the master stand there and chat with you? The emperor of the Soul Realm, if people hear about this, they'll laugh to death!"</p><p></p><p>"This emperor's mistake." The soul guard heard this and quickly looked at Lu Changsheng, slightly bowing, "Immortal Emperor Changsheng, please have a seat."</p><p></p><p>He then glanced at the old turtle, "As for you, old turtle, please go ahead."</p><p></p><p>"Hey, you!"</p><p></p><p>The old turtle was immediately angered, glaring unhappily at the back of the soul guard, but in the end, he just snorted and didn't pursue it further.</p><p></p><p>Among the four great Immortal Emperors of the Immortal Realm, he might be able to handle them, </p><p></p><p>but this soul guard who is the emperor of the Soul Realm is more special, and for him, it's really not easy to handle...</p><p></p><p>Damn it.</p><p></p><p>...</p><p></p><p>On the shore of the Reincarnation Lake, there are still countless wandering souls, heading towards the black vortex in front, just as it has been for the past six hundred years, as people die in the mortal world at every moment, the wandering souls here never cease.</p><p></p><p>In the Reincarnation Lake, a secluded pavilion is suspended, with four lanterns hanging at the four corners, emitting an eerie green glow.</p><p></p><p>Inside the secluded pavilion, three figures are seated in a triangular formation.</p><p></p><p>The soul guard stood up, took the wine jar, rolled up his sleeve, and personally poured a cup of wine for Lu Changsheng.</p><p></p><p>Just as he was about to sit back down, the old turtle suddenly cleared his throat and pushed his wine cup forward, the meaning obvious.</p><p></p><p>Bang.</p><p></p><p>The soul guard rolled his eyes and slammed the wine jar in front of the old turtle, disdainfully saying, "Pour it yourself!"</p><p></p><p>"Hey, you!" The old turtle was angered.</p><p></p><p>"Hmm?" At this moment, Lu Changsheng turned his head and looked at him.</p><p></p><p>The old turtle immediately smiled awkwardly, then glared hatefully at the soul guard before pouring the wine for himself in a sullen manner.</p><p></p><p>The soul guard picked up the wine cup and toasted Lu Changsheng, draining it in one gulp, then hesitantly asked,</p><p></p><p>"Immortal Emperor Changsheng, these past hundred thousand years..."</p><p></p><p>"I've been buried in a tomb in the lower realm." </p><p></p><p>Before the soul guard could finish, Lu Changsheng directly stated with a smile.</p><p></p><p>"Ah? Buried in a tomb?" </p><p></p><p>Even the soul guard was dumbfounded, thinking he had misheard.</p><p></p><p>Lu Changsheng: "That's right, no need to be surprised."</p><p></p><p>The soul guard was slightly embarrassed, this is not something that shouldn't be shocking...</p><p></p><p>But he soon admired inwardly, no wonder he is the Immortal Emperor Changsheng, his state of mind is so stable.</p><p></p><p>However...</p><p></p><p>"Immortal Emperor Changsheng, who has the ability to bury you in a tomb for a hundred thousand years?"</p><p></p><p>The soul guard couldn't help but ask.</p><p></p><p>He suddenly remembered the matter of the Divine Path blockade in the four directions, his eyes flashing, and he asked again, "Could it be the Ancestral Celestial Realm?"</p><p></p><p>The old turtle heard this and also perked up, pricking up his ears to listen.</p><p></p><p>This has always been his puzzlement as well.</p><p></p><p>He had also suspected that this might be the work of the Ancestral Celestial Realm, after all, combined with the blockade of the Divine Path, it's really hard not to connect it to Lu Changsheng being buried.</p><p></p><p>Lu Changsheng turned his head to look at the lifeless waters of the Reincarnation Lake, and said indifferently,</p><p></p><p>New 69 book version 99</p><p></p><p>Here is the full English translation of the Chinese excerpt:</p><p></p><p>"It's not just the Ancestral Heavenly Divine Realm, there are quite a few in the myriad worlds who want to suppress me, Lu Changsheng."</p><p></p><p>Not the Ancestral Heavenly Divine Realm? </p><p></p><p>Old Turtle and Hunhui exchanged a glance, their eyes filled with shock.</p><p></p><p>Especially Old Turtle, he was very perplexed. Over the many years, he had been with Lu Changsheng most of the time, how come he had never heard of this before?... Could it be!</p><p></p><p>Just as Old Turtle was about to ask, Lu Changsheng looked at him and smiled, "That's right, these events happened long before I met you."</p><p></p><p>As he said this, a hint of abstraction flashed across Lu Changsheng's eyes.</p><p></p><p>In the myriad worlds, there is truly no genuine immortality.</p><p></p><p>But he, Lu Changsheng, possessed the one and only Eternal Immortal Body in all the ages.</p><p></p><p>The time was too distant, Lu Changsheng had even forgotten how he was born into this world, only knowing that the Eternal Immortal Body was innate to him, he was the Eternal Immortal Body, and the Eternal Immortal Body was him.</p><p></p><p>Innate to him, were also the Great Dao Eyes in his pupils, and the cultivation that could progress without the need for meditation and cultivation.</p><p></p><p>Sleeping in the tomb for a million years was the period when his cultivation advanced the most.</p><p></p><p>Over the countless eons, those who coveted and feared him were not few in number.</p><p></p><p>All along, they hated and envied him, yet also yearned to become him.</p><p></p><p>They wanted his Eternal Immortal Body, they wanted to refine him.</p><p></p><p>But no one could actually do it.</p><p></p><p>They knew that if this continued, he would only grow stronger, so they joined forces to suppress the not-yet-supreme him in a remote small world, burying him in the indestructible immortal tomb.</p><p></p><p>If they couldn't obtain it, they would destroy it;</p><p>If they couldn't kill him, they would suppress him!</p><p></p><p>Unfortunately, things did not go as planned... In the tomb for a million years, he grew even stronger, easily breaking out of the tomb and returning to the world.</p><p></p><p>When they were suppressing him, they were worried that unexpected things might happen, afraid of Lu Changsheng's retaliation, so they used supreme techniques to collectively erase his memories related to this. But he, Lu Changsheng, was no ordinary person, as time passed, his memories would naturally return.</p><p></p><p>Lu Changsheng's expression was cold as he picked up the wine cup and took a sip.</p><p></p><p>"Master, that person is so strong?" Old Turtle asked solemnly.</p><p></p><p>Hunhui also had a worried expression on his face. Goodness, for someone to be able to suppress Lu Changsheng, how powerful must that person be?!</p><p></p><p>Lu Changsheng shook his head and smiled, "The ones who buried me in the tomb were not just one person, but a group."</p><p></p><p>Old Turtle and Hunhui let out a sigh of relief, this made more sense.</p><p></p><p>"Master, then you..." Old Turtle hesitated.</p><p></p><p>Lu Changsheng knew what Old Turtle wanted to ask, so he said, "There are still some memories that have not yet resurfaced, and that's why I've come to the Spirit Realm."</p><p></p><p>As he said this, Lu Changsheng suddenly looked at Hunhui.</p><p></p><p>The attentive Hunhui was startled, and quickly cupped his hands, "Immortal Emperor Changsheng, please speak, there is nothing Hunhui would not do to help."</p><p></p><p>"In the time I'm about to leave the Four Directions Immortal Realm, if the Underworld Demon Tribe attacks, I hope you can lend a hand."</p><p></p><p>Lu Changsheng looked steadily at Hunhui as he spoke.</p><p></p><p>The Underworld Demon Tribe?</p><p></p><p>Seeing Hunhui's puzzled expression, Old Turtle transmitted some information into Hunhui's mind.</p><p></p><p>Soon, Hunhui understood. He furrowed his brows, as the Ruler of the Spirit Realm, it was not proper for him to interfere in external affairs, if he did...</p><p></p><p>But this was brought up by Lu Changsheng...</p><p></p><p>He quickly made a firm promise, "Immortal Emperor Changsheng, rest assured, if the Underworld Demon Tribe really attacks, Hunhui will lend a hand."</p><p></p><p>Lu Changsheng stood up with a smile, patting Hunhui's shoulder, his tall figure suddenly dissipating!</p><p></p><p>Only his lingering voice remained in the secluded pavilion,</p><p></p><p>"Don't worry, I won't let you be too troubled. When the time comes, if the Underworld Demon Tribe really attacks, just lend a hand with Old Turtle to hold them off a bit."</p><p></p><p>"Until I return, my lord."</p>

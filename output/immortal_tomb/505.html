        <h1>Chapter 505</h1>
        <div class="content">
            <p>Here is the full English translation of the Chinese excerpt:</p><p></p><p>The Realm of Souls.</p><p></p><p>In the Palace of the Soul Emperor, the Soul Emperor Kui was sitting cross-legged, his brow furrowed in deep thought.</p><p></p><p>"What is that azure lamp? Where have I seen it before...?"</p><p></p><p>Lately, Kui's mind had been restless, with a constant feeling that something major was about to happen.</p><p></p><p>As for the azure lamp he had glimpsed, he felt a sense of familiarity, but no matter how hard he tried, he could not recall where he had seen it before.</p><p></p><p>"Your Majesty the Soul Emperor, the Demonic Sprites request an audience."</p><p></p><p>At this moment, outside the Palace of the Soul Emperor, the Demonic Sprites appeared and bowed respectfully.</p><p></p><p>"Oh?" </p><p></p><p>Kui's ox-like eyes narrowed as he spoke in a deep voice, "Quickly, come in!"</p><p></p><p>Soon, the four great Spiritual Generals of the Demonic Sprites entered and were about to report, but Kui rose to his feet, his gaze piercing, and demanded, "Do you have any news of the whereabouts of that azure lamp?"</p><p></p><p>The Spiritual General immediately nodded and respectfully said, "Your Majesty the Soul Emperor, we have found three locations of that azure lamp in the Realm of Souls: one is the Reincarnation Path, the second is the Soul-Severing Platform, and the third is the Lake of Rebirth."</p><p></p><p>"The Reincarnation Path, the Soul-Severing Platform, the Lake of Rebirth?!" </p><p></p><p>Kui muttered, and suddenly his eyes narrowed sharply. "Disaster!"</p><p></p><p>The Demonic Sprites exchanged puzzled glances.</p><p></p><p>"You all come with me!" </p><p></p><p>Kui abruptly vanished from the spot.</p><p></p><p>The Demonic Sprites hurriedly followed.</p><p></p><p>At the shore of the Lake of Rebirth.</p><p></p><p>Kui and the Demonic Sprites suddenly appeared, startling the nearby old caretaker and a group of soul servants, who quickly knelt in reverence.</p><p></p><p>"Greetings, Your Majesty the Soul Emperor, and esteemed Spiritual Generals!"</p><p></p><p>Kui first glanced at the calm Lake of Rebirth, and after seeing that the sealing formation was intact, he let out a slight sigh of relief. Turning to the old caretaker, he frowned and asked, "Has there been any abnormality at the Lake of Rebirth recently?"</p><p></p><p>The old caretaker was taken aback, but quickly replied respectfully, "Your Majesty, the Lake of Rebirth has never had any disturbances!"</p><p></p><p>He guarded this place every day, so he knew it well.</p><p></p><p>Hearing this, Kui was puzzled.</p><p></p><p>This was strange. </p><p></p><p>As the mighty Soul Emperor, he should not have had such an inexplicable sense of unease!</p><p></p><p>Kui waved his hand, signaling the old caretaker and the soul servants to withdraw, then turned back and gazed deeply at the calm, undisturbed Lake of Rebirth.</p><p></p><p>The Demonic Sprites also came to Kui's side, looking out at the lake.</p><p></p><p>"Your Majesty, do you think the Reincarnation Demon Child has encountered a problem?" the Spiritual General asked hesitantly.</p><p></p><p>At these words, the Demonic Sprites also trembled.</p><p></p><p>They were the first to think of this as well, for in the Realm of Souls, aside from the Reincarnation Demon Child, there was nothing that could make the Soul Emperor so anxious.</p><p></p><p>"I have been restless in mind and spirit lately. This Reincarnation Demon Child, sealed within the Lake of Rebirth, may be about to cause trouble," Kui said solemnly, his tone firm.</p><p></p><p>Hearing this, the Demonic Sprites felt a chill.</p><p></p><p>"Your Majesty, the Reincarnation Demon Child was sealed by you, the Immortal Celestial Emperor, and us, the high-ranking members of the Realm of Souls. How could it possibly break free?" the Spiritual General asked, somewhat disbelievingly.</p><p></p><p>As soon as he finished speaking, Kui and the other three Spiritual Generals looked at him as if he were an idiot.</p><p></p><p>"Sprite, this is the Reincarnation Demon Child we're talking about. How can you be so careless?" the Spiritual General said in a grave tone.</p><p></p><p>The Sprite fell silent.</p><p></p><p>Kui stared at the Lake of Rebirth, his gaze flickering, and suddenly said, "I must descend into this Lake of Rebirth."</p><p></p><p>Huh?</p><p></p><p>The Demonic Sprites were startled.</p><p></p><p>"Ah, I specifically had the Immortal Celestial Emperor imprison the Reincarnation Demon Child in the Realm of Souls. The Immortal Celestial Emperor has done me this favor, and if anything happens to the Reincarnation Demon Child, I will have no face to show him," Kui said helplessly, and then sat down cross-legged on the spot, slowly closing his eyes and making hand seals.</p><p></p><p>Seeing this, the Demonic Sprites exchanged a glance and stepped aside.</p><p></p><p>Soon, a strange green glow emerged from Kui's forehead and sank into the Lake of Rebirth.</p><p></p><p>Time passed, moment by moment, and Kui's brow grew increasingly furrowed.</p><p></p><p>At a certain point, Kui suddenly opened his eyes, standing up in silence.</p><p></p><p>Here is the full English translation of the Chinese excerpt:</p><p></p><p>"The Reincarnation Demon Child has disappeared."</p><p></p><p>Huh?</p><p></p><p>The eyes of the demonic beings suddenly changed!</p><p></p><p>Suddenly, the number of souls at the Afterlife Lake increased dramatically, and the soul servants hurriedly went forward to maintain order.</p><p></p><p>But the number of souls kept increasing, making the old butler and the others break out in a cold sweat.</p><p></p><p>"Your Majesty the Soul Emperor, news has arrived that the souls from all realms have increased for no reason, and the numbers are becoming more and more exaggerated!" the Soul Spirit reported solemnly.</p><p></p><p>The breathing of the other three great spirit generals also became rapid. After connecting the dots, it was highly likely that the Reincarnation Demon Child was on a killing spree.</p><p></p><p>If the Reincarnation Demon Child continued the massacre, the Soul Realm would soon descend into chaos again!</p><p></p><p>The Soul Hound was silent for a moment, looking up at the gloomy sky of the Soul Realm and said in a deep voice, "The Seventy-Two Calamities and the Thirty-Six Evils, come see this Emperor immediately!"</p><p></p><p>Soon, the Heavenly Seventy-Two Calamities and the Earthly Thirty-Six Evils appeared at the Afterlife Lake.</p><p></p><p>They were about to speak, but the Soul Hound interrupted them:</p><p></p><p>"The Seventy-Two Calamities will stay in the Soul Realm to stabilize the order, and the Four Great Spirit Generals and the Thirty-Six Evils will follow this Emperor to the outside world!"</p><p></p><p>"Yes!" The Thirty-Six Evils immediately responded.</p><p></p><p>The Seventy-Two Calamities, however, revealed a bitter expression, as based on the rate of the increasing souls, they might not be able to hold out for long with just the seventy-two of them.</p><p></p><p>"Do your best, this Emperor will return as soon as possible, let's go!"</p><p></p><p>The Soul Hound finished speaking and disappeared with the Four Great Spirit Generals and the Thirty-Six Evils from the Afterlife Lake.</p><p></p><p>"Ah, that damned Reincarnation Demon Child!"</p><p></p><p>"The Afterlife Lake was clearly sealed, how did the Reincarnation Demon Child escape?"</p><p></p><p>"Look, the sealing formation is still intact."</p><p></p><p>"Enough, let's just go maintain order. The sudden influx of so many souls in the Soul Realm must be the Reincarnation Demon Child's mischief."</p><p></p><p>...</p><p></p><p>The boundless void.</p><p></p><p>A terrifying-looking little boy was wandering about recklessly, occasionally letting out a crazy and sinister laughter.</p><p></p><p>The little boy seemed to be displeased with any star he saw, and would suddenly open his horrifying mouth to swallow the entire star, with all the living beings and the Heavenly Dao inside dying.</p><p></p><p>After swallowing the star, the little boy let out a burp, thinking that he would rest in a place for today.</p><p></p><p>"Reincarnation Demon Child!!"</p><p></p><p>However, at this moment, a fierce shout suddenly rang out.</p><p></p><p>The Reincarnation Demon Child paused, tilting his head to look, and then sneered coldly, "Oh, I wonder who it is, it turns out to be the Soul Emperor..."</p><p></p><p>In the distance, the Soul Hound, the Four Great Spirit Generals, and the Thirty-Six Evils were soaring there, their expressions grave.</p><p></p><p>"The seal is unbroken, how did you escape the Afterlife Lake?" the Soul Hound stared at the Reincarnation Demon Child and asked coldly.</p><p></p><p>"Hehe, why would I tell you? Great Soul Emperor?" the Reincarnation Demon Child mocked with a smile, then turned and waved his hand, "I've had my fill and need to find a place to digest, see you later~"</p><p></p><p>But the next moment, the Four Great Spirit Generals and the Thirty-Six Evils appeared around the Reincarnation Demon Child, surrounding him!</p><p></p><p>The Reincarnation Demon Child sneered, "Do you really think these rotten fish and shrimps can stop me?"</p><p></p><p>The Soul Hound's figure flashed, appearing in front of the Reincarnation Demon Child. "You have disregarded the lives of living beings and disrupted the order of the world, your crime deserves death."</p><p></p><p>The Reincarnation Demon Child laughed eerily, "I've only eaten a few worlds, what's the big deal? Anyway, the boundless void is about to collapse, and when that happens, not only these small worlds, but even your Soul Realm will be reduced to nothingness."</p><p></p><p>Hearing this, the Soul Hound and the other high-ranking members of the Soul Realm changed their expressions!</p><p></p><p>"It seems you know quite a bit."</p><p></p><p>Suddenly, a light laughter echoed in this void.</p><p></p><p>Hearing this familiar voice, the Soul Hound was first startled, then a mix of joy and shame.</p>

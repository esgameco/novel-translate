        <h1>Chapter 432</h1>
        <div class="content">
            <p>Here is the full English translation of the Chinese excerpt:</p><p></p><p>The Royal Palace, the Hall of Governance.</p><p></p><p>Yun Ze Cang sat on the high dais, looking down at the officials below and said indifferently:</p><p></p><p>"The Crown Prince of the ancient Kingdom of Fengluan will soon arrive in the capital to arrange the marriage. Let it be announced that Princess Kening will soon be wed to the Kingdom of Fengluan."</p><p></p><p>Hearing this, the officials were overjoyed and exchanged glances, then unanimously bowed down:</p><p></p><p>"Your Majesty is most wise!!"</p><p></p><p>With this, the two countries would not have to go to war, which was a great blessing for both the people and the officials themselves. </p><p></p><p>If Yunlan really went to war with Fengluan, the consequences for Yunlan would be unimaginable, and the officials would likely end up displaced and adrift.</p><p></p><p>Yun Ze Cang lowered his eyelids and waved his hand wearily.</p><p></p><p>The officials, understanding his mood, did not dare to disturb him further and took their leave one by one.</p><p></p><p>"We shall take our leave, Your Majesty."</p><p></p><p>...</p><p></p><p>The news of Princess Kening's impending marriage to Fengluan spread quickly throughout the capital, and even reached other regions of Yunlan.</p><p></p><p>In the capital, people were discussing the matter privately:</p><p></p><p>"Princess Kening of Weiyang Palace is going to marry the Crown Prince of Fengluan? Come on, I'm way better than that Crown Prince of Fengluan!"</p><p></p><p>"How is that possible? Princess Kening is the most beloved princess of the King, everyone in the capital knows this. How could the King possibly..."</p><p></p><p>"But the fact is right in front of us now."</p><p></p><p>"Ah, my Princess Kening..."</p><p></p><p>"In fact, if you look at the various conflicts between Fengluan and our Yunlan in recent years, you can see the reason for this."</p><p></p><p>"So what about the conflicts? Fengluan's comprehensive national strength is far greater than ours in Yunlan."</p><p></p><p>"Exactly, if the two countries want to get along, why should it be us Yunlan sending a princess over? It should be Fengluan sending a princess here!"</p><p></p><p>"Alas! I don't know what the King is thinking. Not only is he marrying off a princess, but it's the most beloved Princess Kening... Isn't this just showing weakness to Fengluan?"</p><p></p><p>"Shhh, be careful with your words. The King must have his reasons, maybe there are difficulties we don't know about."</p><p></p><p>"Hmph, in my eyes, marrying off Princess Kening is a show of weakness, a loss of the dignity of a great country. What's wrong with me venting a bit? If they want to throw me in the dungeon, so be it, I don't care."</p><p></p><p>...</p><p></p><p>At the same time,</p><p></p><p>The ruddy-faced old turtle was supporting the weak-kneed Yun Ao Xie as they came out of the Wanhua Pavilion, where they had been playing for several days.</p><p></p><p>"You're not bad, kid." </p><p></p><p>The old turtle said with a half-smile.</p><p></p><p>Yun Ao Xie chuckled sheepishly, turning his head and admiring respectfully, "Senior Turtle is still more skilled. It seems I still have more to learn."</p><p></p><p>The old turtle: "Hehe, although the Wanhua Pavilion hasn't reached the level where I can stroll out casually, it's quite good. In recent years, the Wanhua Pavilion has been one of the highest quality brothels I've visited."</p><p></p><p>Yun Ao Xie: "That's great, as long as Senior Turtle can enjoy himself to the fullest, that is my wish."</p><p></p><p>Suddenly, the old turtle's brow furrowed as the various discussions in the capital reached his ears from the shadows.</p><p></p><p>Noticing the old turtle's expression, Yun Ao Xie couldn't help but ask anxiously, "Senior Turtle, have you not been fully satisfied?"</p><p></p><p>The old turtle shook his head and suddenly asked, "Ao Xie, is there a princess in your Yunlan royal family named Kening?"</p><p></p><p>"Yes..." Yun Ao Xie was taken aback, looking somewhat confused, then his pupils suddenly shrank as he hurriedly said, "Senior Turtle, Kening is still young..."</p><p></p><p>The old turtle's face darkened, and he said impatiently, "What are you thinking about?"</p><p></p><p>Yun Ao Xie realized his misunderstanding and scratched his head, chuckling awkwardly, "Then why did you suddenly ask about Kening?"</p><p></p><p>Yun Ao Xie was still puzzled as to how the old turtle knew about Kening.</p><p></p><p>Here is the full English translation of the Chinese excerpt:</p><p></p><p>It exists.</p><p></p><p>"Now in the capital, everyone is discussing the matter of that Can Ning wanting to marry into the ancient country of Feng Luan. Grandpa Turtle was curious and asked you about it," the old turtle said jokingly.</p><p></p><p>Ah? Marry into Feng Luan?</p><p></p><p>Yun Ao Xie's expression changed slightly!</p><p></p><p>...</p><p></p><p>Yun Ao Xie and the old turtle returned to the palace and went their separate ways, rushing towards where Yun Ze Cang was.</p><p></p><p>"This prince wants to see the father king!"</p><p></p><p>Outside the luxurious bedroom, Yun Ao Xie hurriedly said to the guarding imperial guards.</p><p></p><p>The imperial guards saw that it was the Ninth Prince, so they went in to report it. Soon, they came out and respectfully said, "Ninth Prince, the king said he is a bit tired and will not see you."</p><p></p><p>Yun Ao Xie's eyes flickered, and he looked sharply at the bedroom, shouting loudly:</p><p></p><p>"Father king! Your son Ao Xie requests an audience!"</p><p></p><p>The imperial guards' eyes hardened, and one stepped forward to block him, coldly saying, "Ninth Prince, this is the king's private bedroom. Please do not make a loud commotion."</p><p></p><p>At this moment, Yun Ao Xie didn't care about these things and continued to shout loudly, "Father king! Your son Ao Xie requests an audience! There is something I want to ask!"</p><p></p><p>With such a commotion, many eunuchs and palace maids nearby couldn't help but look over.</p><p></p><p>The guards, fearing that Yun Ze Cang would punish them, coldly shouted, </p><p></p><p>"Ninth Prince, please be mindful of the occasion! If you continue to make a loud commotion, don't blame us for apprehending you!!"</p><p></p><p>Yun Ao Xie paid no heed and continued to shout, "Father king, Ao Xie requests an audience!!"</p><p></p><p>The imperial guards' expressions changed, and the leader waved his hand and said in a deep voice, </p><p></p><p>"Ninth Prince, we apologize, but seize him!!"</p><p></p><p>"Yes!" Just as the guards were about to move to apprehend Yun Ao Xie, Yun Ze Cang's voice came from the bedroom, "Let him in."</p><p></p><p>The guards' hearts immediately relaxed. As for the Ninth Prince, of course it was better not to offend him if possible.</p><p></p><p>After all, based on the current situation, the Ninth Prince was most likely to be the future crown prince.</p><p></p><p>"Ninth Prince, please come in."</p><p></p><p>"Hmph."</p><p></p><p>Yun Ao Xie ignored them and hurriedly entered the bedroom.</p><p></p><p>As soon as he entered the bedroom, Yun Ao Xie saw Yun Ze Cang sitting there. Yun Ao Xie immediately knelt down and paid his respects, "Your son Ao Xie pays respects to the father king. Father king, Ao Xie wants to..."</p><p></p><p>"Are you inquiring about Can Ning's marriage?" Yun Ze Cang waved his hand and said indifferently.</p><p></p><p>Yun Ao Xie paused, and said with difficulty, "Father king, your son knows that there is enmity between our Cloud Mist and Feng Luan. A marriage alliance to mend relations is not inappropriate, and marrying a princess is also acceptable. But why is it not another princess, but Can Ning?"</p><p></p><p>Yun Ze Cang looked at Yun Ao Xie and said frankly, "Xie'er, the Great Prince of Feng Luan has taken a liking to Can Ning, and Feng Luan has the Divine Realm."</p><p></p><p>The Divine Realm...</p><p></p><p>Yun Ao Xie's pupils contracted, full of disbelief. He did not understand why the good Feng Luan would have a Divine Realm expert!</p><p></p><p>Yun Ze Cang stood up, turned his back, and said again,</p><p></p><p>"And it's not that your father king fears that Divine Realm, but as the ruler of a country, your father king has to consider too many things. Your father king has also inquired about Can Ning's intentions, and if Can Ning does not agree, your father king will not force her. Do you understand?"</p><p></p><p>"Your son... understands. Your son will go see Sister Ning. Father king, please rest."</p><p></p><p>Yun Ao Xie slowly got up, bowed, and left.</p><p></p><p>Yun Ze Cang looked at Yun Ao Xie's retreating back and suddenly said, "Xie'er, when that Great Prince of Feng Luan arrives, he will surely be arrogant. Do not provoke his temper."</p><p></p><p>Yun Ao Xie's figure paused for a moment, "Your son understands."</p>

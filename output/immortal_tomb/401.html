        <h1>Chapter 401</h1>
        <div class="content">
            <p>Here is the full English translation of the excerpt from the Chinese novel:</p><p></p><p>The sudden voice caused the cultivators of the myriad races to narrow their eyes and hurriedly search all around!</p><p></p><p>The eyes of Shen Ting also slowly narrowed.</p><p></p><p>At the same time, the figure of Lu Changsheng gradually materialized in the scene.</p><p></p><p>"Lord Lu..."</p><p></p><p>Jian Wuhui and the others were slightly surprised, but soon became bitter. What use was it for Lu Changsheng to come, other than adding another doomed soul?</p><p></p><p>They actually hoped that Lu Changsheng could find a way to flee far away, and have a chance to seek justice for them in the future.</p><p></p><p>However, their hearts were still moved.</p><p></p><p>Oh?</p><p></p><p>Hearing the murmurs of Jian Wuhui and the others, the cultivators of the myriad races fixed their gaze on Lu Changsheng!</p><p></p><p>Could this person actually be the Azure Robe Sword Immortal of the human race?</p><p></p><p>"Tsk, so he is that Lu Nan of the human race. What is he thinking, coming here to seek death at this time!"</p><p></p><p>"Ah, it's a pity for the human race. With Lu Nan's strength, if he had quietly cultivated and gained insights, he might have had the chance to break through to the Divine Realm. Wouldn't it be better to seek revenge later?"</p><p></p><p>"But the human race is truly united. In terms of unity, they are the first among the myriad races."</p><p></p><p>"Don't say anymore, what's to come will definitely be brutal, I can't bear to watch."</p><p></p><p>"......"</p><p></p><p>While the cultivators of the myriad races were discussing,</p><p></p><p>The clan leaders on the stone pillars, such as Bi You and Ao Zhengtian, also looked at the Lu Changsheng below with surprise and doubt.</p><p></p><p>Lu Nan of the human race?</p><p></p><p>Seeing the tragic state of the human race, did this person still couldn't help but expose himself?</p><p></p><p>"Hahaha! Lu Nan, are you so eager to die?" Shen Luo exclaimed excitedly! "Father, this is him, he is the Lu Nan who killed Uncle Wei!"</p><p></p><p>Although Lu Nan's appearance had changed, it was obvious that it was him!</p><p></p><p>"I, the Divine Lord, wonder who you are? So you are the so-called Azure Robe Sword Immortal, the Lu Nan who slew my Third Divine Official?" Shen Ting sneered.</p><p></p><p>"You humans are indeed united, each one rushing to seek death..."</p><p></p><p>"Lord... Lord Lu, this beast killed the Golden Wheel King!" The disordered Yan Jueyi trembled as he spoke.</p><p></p><p>"Mm." Lu Changsheng responded indifferently, without the slightest emotional fluctuation.</p><p></p><p>Hearing Yan Jueyi cursing him as a beast again, Shen Ting's eyes turned cold, and he suddenly stomped down hard!</p><p></p><p>But then he was shocked to find that his foot couldn't be pressed down at all, as if it had become stiff...</p><p></p><p>What's going on?</p><p></p><p>Soon, Shen Ting looked towards the azure-robed man, could it be him??</p><p></p><p>Thinking of this, a look of disbelief appeared in Shen Ting's eyes, and then, in the puzzled gaze of the cultivators of the myriad races, he withdrew his foot from Yan Jueyi's head!</p><p></p><p>"You absolutely are not from the Divine-Demon Battlefield, who are you exactly?"</p><p></p><p>Shen Ting's eyes flickered as he asked.</p><p></p><p>The situation had suddenly taken a turn, and that implicit move just now had immediately aroused Shen Ting's suspicion and vigilance.</p><p></p><p>Shen Ting recalled everything he had heard about the azure-robed man recently, and combined with the latter's calm demeanor at this moment...</p><p></p><p>And this kind of person, he had never heard of before, and he had never seen on any of the major rankings, which meant that this person must have arrived at the Divine-Demon Battlefield not long ago.</p><p></p><p>Otherwise, with such a powerful expert, why would the human race hide and conceal him?</p><p></p><p>Judging from that move just now, this Lu Nan might not be weaker than him, and might even be at the Divine Realm as well...</p><p></p><p>Shen Ting's heart became troubled, and endless malice began to grow.</p><p></p><p>In this Divine-Demon Battlefield, one Divine Realm expert was enough!</p><p></p><p>Then let's fight a battle, and kill this azure-robed man!</p><p></p><p>After all, he had not yet tested how strong his Divine Realm truly was, since Bi You and Ao Zhengtian couldn't even withstand one of his attacks!</p><p></p><p>Thinking of this, Shen Ting's expression became cold and ruthless, his hair flying, and his aura began to surge crazily!</p><p></p><p>Spiritual energy gradually enveloped his body, and gradually, a terrifying pressure unique to the Divine Realm suddenly erupted!</p><p></p><p>It swept through the vast Divine Pavilion inside and out with a thunderous boom!</p><p></p><p>Under this mighty Divine Realm pressure, the cultivators of the myriad races turned pale, being crushed to the ground, coughing up blood frantically!</p><p></p><p>They looked at the central Divine Lord with horrified expressions, but fortunately the Divine Lord did not...</p><p></p><p>Here is the full English translation of the Chinese excerpt:</p><p></p><p>The intention was to kill them, otherwise, under this oppressive pressure, they would all be wiped out!</p><p></p><p>The cultivators of the myriad tribes could not imagine what a heart-pounding scene was unfolding for the young man in the blue robe, who was at the forefront of this oppressive force.</p><p></p><p>It was estimated that the young man in the blue robe, along with the human cultivators, had been instantly crushed into a bloody mist.</p><p></p><p>Involuntarily, the cultivators of the myriad tribes strained to shift their gaze towards Lu Changsheng.</p><p></p><p>And then they were stunned!</p><p></p><p>The young man in the blue robe was still the same young man, standing there unharmed, without any change.</p><p></p><p>The human cultivators behind him were also unscathed, and there was no scene of them exploding into a bloody mist as imagined.</p><p></p><p>The myriad tribes were shocked!</p><p></p><p>Shen Ting, however, was not surprised, for he had long known that this young man in the blue robe was no ordinary person!</p><p></p><p>Immediately, Shen Ting's aura became increasingly fierce, gradually reaching its peak!</p><p></p><p>Unknowingly, dark clouds gathered in the sky, and the mist dispersed!</p><p></p><p>The space began to tremble violently, as if it was about to shatter at any moment!</p><p></p><p>Shen Ting, seeing that his aura had reached its peak, wanted to challenge him.</p><p></p><p>But at this moment, Lu Changsheng spoke softly, "Kneel down and crawl over."</p><p></p><p>Boom!!</p><p></p><p>With these words, it was as if the voice of a true divine being, and the celestial phenomena instantly dissipated!</p><p></p><p>And Shen Ting's aura, which had reached its peak, vanished like a mouse encountering a cat!</p><p></p><p>Shen Ting's scalp tingled, and his eyes were filled with disbelief and terror. The next moment, his knees bent uncontrollably, and he knelt on the ground with a thud!</p><p></p><p>The myriad tribes were horrified!</p><p></p><p>Everyone present, without exception, had lost their souls at this moment, like marionettes, staring dumbly at this incredibly bizarre scene!</p><p></p><p>Jian Wuhui and the others were trembling, not out of excitement, but out of fear!</p><p></p><p>They now doubted whether Lord Lu was truly one of their human race...</p><p></p><p>"Heavenly Deity Lord! Father!"</p><p></p><p>The Heavenly Deity Clan, including Shen Yue, Shen Xing, and Shen Luo, were all at a loss, watching this unfold.</p><p></p><p>Shen Luo's eyes were filled with fear as he looked at Lu Changsheng, for the situation had completely deviated from his expectations!</p><p></p><p>In his imagination, it should not have been like this!</p><p></p><p>Upon hearing this, Lu Changsheng slowly turned his head and gave the Heavenly Deity Clan members a faint look.</p><p></p><p>And with just that one look, Shen Yue and Shen Xing were instantly reduced to a bloody mist.</p><p></p><p>Immediately after, it was the terrified Shen Luo, as well as one Heavenly Deity Clan member after another, who revealed expressions of fear.</p><p></p><p>"No, no!"</p><p></p><p>"Boom, boom, boom..."</p><p></p><p>The rhythmic explosions accompanied by the agonizing screams formed a symphony that echoed throughout the Heavenly Deity Plaza.</p><p></p><p>Witnessing this scene, Shen Ting finally turned completely pale!</p><p></p><p>He was terrified!</p><p></p><p>The young man in the blue robe had exceeded his imagination.</p><p></p><p>Shen Ting, unable to control himself, bent down and slowly crawled towards where Lu Changsheng stood, under the gaze of all.</p><p></p><p>At this moment, the Heavenly Deity Lord was like a stray dog, in stark contrast to his previous arrogance and boldness.</p><p></p><p>This stark contrast only further shook Shen Ting's mentality.</p><p></p><p>Bi Yu, Ao Zhengtian, and the other clan leaders, as well as Jian Wuhui and the others, were all dazed, watching Shen Ting crawl like a dog towards the young man in the blue robe.</p><p></p><p>And the young man in the blue robe, standing with his hands behind his back, seemed indifferent to everything!</p><p></p><p>Even with the supreme Heavenly Deity Lord kneeling before him, he remained calm and composed, without a trace of joy or sorrow on his face.</p><p></p><p>As if everything was as it should be!</p><p></p><p>Suddenly, a massive Dao Celestial Phantom appeared in the sky!</p><p></p><p>The Dao Celestial from the Divine-Demonic Battlefield!</p><p></p><p>The cultivators of the myriad tribes were startled!</p><p></p><p>Shen Ting first paused, then his expression turned joyful. He looked up at the Dao Celestial, a glimmer of hope in his eyes.</p><p></p><p>But the Dao Celestial's next words were like a heavy blow, stunning Shen Ting and nearly causing the cultivators of the myriad tribes to suffer from brain concussions.</p><p></p><p>"Lord Changsheng, please proceed. Afterwards, I hope Lord Changsheng will be gracious enough to grant the Dao Celestial an audience."</p><p></p><p>Lu Changsheng stood with his hands behind his back, indifferently, "Mm, you may withdraw."</p>

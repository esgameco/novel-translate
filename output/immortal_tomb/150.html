        <h1>Chapter 150</h1>
        <div class="content">
            <p>Here is my translation of the Chinese excerpt:</p><p></p><p>"Here, my rules are the rules. 🍑 ⋆ 🍭🎀𝟨𝟫𝓈𝒽𝓊𝓍.𝒸☯𝓂🎀🍭 ⋆ 🍑" </p><p></p><p>Lu Changsheng said, then turned and walked into the tavern, saying, "Those who want to drink, line up. Those who don't, leave."</p><p></p><p>After Lu Changsheng disappeared from sight, the terrifying pressure in the air suddenly vanished.</p><p></p><p>Gulp, gulp...</p><p></p><p>Phew!</p><p></p><p>Suddenly, the sounds of swallowing and heavy breathing filled the air, one after another.</p><p></p><p>The crowd recalled the earlier events, their hearts heavy with trepidation!</p><p></p><p>They almost let their guard down. Indeed, those who dare to come to this Black Abyss Domain are no ordinary characters...</p><p></p><p>And the proprietor of this Long Life Tavern is definitely an extremely formidable character!</p><p></p><p>From today onwards, </p><p>the landscape of Qingxuan Town may undergo some changes...</p><p></p><p>When the news reaches the top powers of Qingxuan Town, they will surely be unsettled!</p><p></p><p>Seeing this, Tong Xin and Lin Dong exchanged a glance, the corners of their mouths curling up slightly, a hint of contentment flashing in their eyes. Tong Xin then stepped forward and bowed, saying,</p><p></p><p>"Esteemed guests, our proprietor just said that today is the grand opening, and there is a free drink for anyone who would like one. Please line up in an orderly fashion."</p><p></p><p>Hearing this, the crowd snapped out of their daze, one by one rising from the ground.</p><p></p><p>Many glared resentfully at the flushed-faced Peng Fang, then turned and left. A small number began lining up, their gazes flickering.</p><p></p><p>"Haha, this is great!" </p><p></p><p>Peng Fang was delighted, having made a huge profit today!</p><p></p><p>He then cheerfully joined the queue, ready to patronize the Long Life Tavern, since they had let him earn so much.</p><p></p><p>He knew that those who had lost money to him today would surely come looking to settle the score later, as this was the Black Abyss Domain, which was only natural.</p><p></p><p>But Peng Fang was not afraid, for if he had the courage to open a business here, he must have some strength backing him up.</p><p></p><p>"Young Master, shall we return?" </p><p></p><p>The maid asked tremulously, looking at Zuo Qizhan's back.</p><p></p><p>"Return for what? Since we're here, let's have a drink."</p><p></p><p>Zuo Qizhan replied indifferently, then joined the queue.</p><p></p><p>The maid grew anxious, saying, "Young Master, the proprietor of this tavern is unfathomable. If anything were to happen to you here, the Master would..."</p><p></p><p>"Shut up!" Zuo Qizhan snapped, his gaze flickering. She was curious about what purpose this young man in green had in opening a tavern in Qingxuan Town.</p><p></p><p>The maid fell silent, daring not to speak further, feeling a little aggrieved. She was only concerned for her young mistress's safety.</p><p></p><p>A long queue had formed in front of the Long Life Tavern, a sight that left many passing cultivators gaping in astonishment.</p><p></p><p>What was going on? Were they buying something?</p><p></p><p>Since when did Qingxuan Town have people lining up to buy things?</p><p></p><p>They were all formidable figures in the Black Abyss Domain, how could they have such patience...</p><p></p><p>Later, upon learning it was the Long Life Tavern, they were all left in disbelief. After inquiring, they learned of the earlier events.</p><p></p><p>It turned out the proprietor of this Long Life Tavern was of such remarkable strength.</p><p></p><p>...</p><p></p><p>Seeing the first batch of customers enter, Tong Xin quickly gave Lin Dong a meaningful look and hurried in after them.</p><p></p><p>Lin Dong understood, and with a slight bow, said, "Please wait, esteemed guests. You may enter after this batch has finished."</p><p></p><p>Hearing this, the crowd frowned, but after the previous incident, they did not dare to be reckless.</p><p></p><p>Resigned, they could only wait in silence.</p><p></p><p>It was not that they were greedy for the free drink, but most of those in the queue, like Zuo Qizhan, simply wanted to know the purpose of this tavern owner in coming to Qingxuan Town.</p><p></p><p>Meanwhile, inside the tavern,</p><p></p><p>Tong Xin had already ushered the first batch of customers to their tables, then hurried past the curtain into the inner room to prepare the drinks.</p><p></p><p>The guests sat at their seats, restrained, not daring to chat, just discreetly surveying the unremarkable tavern.</p><p></p><p>Their gazes all fleetingly passed over the reclining figure in the rocking chair by the counter, the young man in green...</p><p></p><p>Here is the full English translation of the excerpt from the Chinese novel:</p><p></p><p>Peng Fang retracted his gaze and lowered his head to rub his plump belly, marveling inwardly that the innkeeper was indeed an extraordinary person, completely unfathomable in his intentions.</p><p></p><p>After surveying the interior of the inn for a while, Zuo Qizhan's gaze couldn't help but linger on Lu Changsheng's face, her eyes flickering, lost in thought.</p><p></p><p>And at that moment, she was startled to see that the young man in blue had somehow opened his eyes and was gazing at her pensively...</p><p></p><p>Those calm eyes were like a deep abyss, captivating her.</p><p></p><p>Zuo Qizhan's face stiffened, and she hastily shifted her gaze elsewhere, her heart pounding.</p><p></p><p>Lu Changsheng remained expressionless, his eyes closing again.</p><p></p><p>"Esteemed guests, the drinks are here! This is the 'Soul-Cleansing Brew', and since it's our opening day, you can have a free cup. But it won't be free after today."</p><p></p><p>At this, Tong Xin came running out, carrying a wine jug and smiling cheerfully.</p><p></p><p>Although the guests didn't outwardly show it, they were inwardly quite disdainful. Just a cup of ordinary wine, and they were making such a fuss about it. "Soul-Cleansing Brew"? What a strange name, they'd never even heard of it!</p><p></p><p>However, when Tong Xin removed the jug's lid, the expressions on the guests' faces changed dramatically!</p><p></p><p>An indescribable aroma of wine instantly permeated the entire inn!</p><p></p><p>Peng Fang also unconsciously swallowed, his expression shaken. When had he ever encountered such a fragrant wine? If he were to have a single cup of this, he would gladly spend his entire fortune...</p><p></p><p>Including Zuo Qizhan, the guests all licked their lips, their throats working.</p><p></p><p>It was rare for cultivators to not enjoy drinking wine.</p><p></p><p>Next, Tong Xin proceeded to pour a cup for each of them, not too much, not too little, and the measurements were all the same.</p><p></p><p>The guests stared at the crystalline liquid in their cups, dumbfounded. Could they really be allowed to drink such an exquisite vintage for free?</p><p></p><p>They were somewhat skeptical of their good fortune.</p><p></p><p>Seeing this, Tong Xin inwardly gloated. This fine wine was the master's recipe, but he and Lin Dong had brewed it themselves. After tasting it, they had been utterly astounded - how could there be such a delicious wine in the world! The master truly lived up to his reputation, and they knew that with just this one cup, he could make countless wine enthusiasts bow in reverence.</p><p></p><p>"M-Master, we... we can really drink this?" Peng Fang trembled as he held up the wine cup, glancing uncertainly at the reclining Lu Changsheng.</p><p></p><p>The others were the same, looking at Lu Changsheng with a dreamlike expression. If the innkeeper were to suddenly deny them the drink now, they felt they would die of craving.</p><p></p><p>Lu Changsheng, eyes closed, smiled and said, "Of course you may."</p><p></p><p>Hearing this, the guests became exhilarated, placing the cups under their noses to savor the aroma, then carefully taking a sip.</p><p></p><p>The wine lingered in their mouths, madly stimulating their taste buds, and the ultimate fragrance filled their nostrils. </p><p></p><p>Before their eyes, it was no longer an inn, but a place filled with birdsong and floral scents, and the mysterious air seemed to cleanse some of the sins from their bodies, leaving them feeling refreshed and at ease.</p><p></p><p>"'Soul-Cleansing Brew'... the name is quite apt, this is... such a wonderful wine!" Peng Fang came to his senses, gazing at the wine in his hand with an enraptured expression.</p><p></p><p>Zuo Qizhan also praised it profusely, her face flushed with two spots of color.</p><p></p><p>At this moment, the guests were reluctant to finish their drinks, their eyes gleaming with the desire to preserve the remnants of this exquisite vintage.</p><p></p><p>Seeing this, Tong Xin apologized, "Esteemed guests, please finish your wine. It's our inn's rule that the wine cannot be taken out of the premises."</p><p></p><p>The guests inwardly bristled, but when their gaze fell upon the reclining young man in blue, they immediately sobered up.</p>

        <h1>Chapter 247</h1>
        <div class="content">
            <p>Here is the full English translation of the Chinese excerpt:</p><p></p><p>The old monk directly denied the second condition. üíõüêú6‚ûàùî∞‚Ñé‚ìä‚ìç.·ëïùê®‚ìúüíã‚ôü</p><p></p><p>Even before he came to this place, he had already seen that this small town was not a place of treasure.</p><p></p><p>Looking at it this way, only the first and third conditions could be explained.</p><p></p><p>Thinking of the precious treasure, the old monk's eyes showed no fluctuation. Having cultivated the Buddhist Way for many years, his heart had long since transcended greed.</p><p></p><p>If there was truly a precious treasure in Yanyu Town, he would naturally not forcibly seize it.</p><p></p><p>As for the third condition, in his perception, he did not sense any powerful cultivators in the town, but there were a few shallow cultivators hiding within.</p><p></p><p>But thinking about it, if there were powerful cultivators, they would naturally have the ability to conceal their aura and be undetectable by others.</p><p></p><p>The townspeople looked at the old monk who had stopped and was staring blankly, with a somewhat puzzled expression.</p><p></p><p>Mirror Observation inclined his body, stood with one palm in front of his chest, and paid a slight salute, saying, "Esteemed patrons, may I ask if there are any cultivators in the town?"</p><p></p><p>After speaking, Mirror Observation looked at the expressions and reactions of the people, and he immediately understood.</p><p></p><p>There was indeed a cultivator known to the townspeople in the town.</p><p></p><p>And this cultivator was most likely the powerful cultivator who had influenced the fortunes of the people.</p><p></p><p>The people saw that the old monk had a kind face and also showed a smile.</p><p></p><p>However... they were a bit hesitant.</p><p></p><p>They were afraid that if they caused trouble for Mr. Lu, it would be difficult to handle.</p><p></p><p>Although this old monk seemed kind and not like the kind of person who would come to cause trouble.</p><p></p><p>But they were a bit unsure.</p><p></p><p>Mirror Observation smiled slightly and said, "Esteemed patrons, you need not worry, this poor monk has no ill intentions."</p><p></p><p>Seeing the kind smile on the old monk's face, the people were somehow instantly won over.</p><p></p><p>They then laughed and said:</p><p></p><p>"Master, as for cultivators, in our Yanyu Town, the one we can usually see is just Mr. Lu."</p><p></p><p>"Mr. Lu's clinic is in the southwest, Master, you can go and see it."</p><p></p><p>"But Master, let me tell you, if you dare to offend Mr. Lu, our Yanyu Town won't welcome you! Although you are a cultivator, I'm an old man who's almost in the grave, and I'm not afraid of you, even without shoes!"</p><p></p><p>"Cough, Old Man Sun, the Master is also barefoot."</p><p></p><p>"Uh..."</p><p></p><p>Mirror Observation shook his head and smiled. He naturally wouldn't take offense, and then he paid a salute and walked towards the southwest with his cane.</p><p></p><p>...</p><p></p><p>Soon, Mirror Observation arrived outside the Longevity Clinic.</p><p></p><p>His old eyes scanned back and forth between the clinic's signboard and the horizontal banner.</p><p></p><p>Then he pursed his lips and entered the courtyard.</p><p></p><p>As soon as Mirror Observation entered the clinic, he saw the little Tong sitting at the long table, seriously reading a book, holding a rag as if she would never finish cleaning.</p><p></p><p>And in the rocking chair, a young man in blue robes was resting with his eyes closed.</p><p></p><p>In an instant, Mirror Observation's gaze became focused.</p><p></p><p>The fortune surrounding this little girl was so thick that it was hair-raising.</p><p></p><p>Even the young man who was cleaning, his fortune was also extremely exaggerated.</p><p></p><p>Far beyond the level that this place should possess.</p><p></p><p>Finally, Mirror Observation's gaze rested on the young man in blue robes, and after scrutinizing him, his brow deeply furrowed.</p><p></p><p>The young man in blue robes had not a single thread of fortune surrounding him, his entire aura was obscure to the extreme, like a bottomless abyss, staring at him...</p><p></p><p>Unfathomable, difficult to fathom.</p><p></p><p>The little Tong's peripheral vision noticed the old monk with surprise, wondering where this old monk came from.</p><p></p><p>But after observing him, her heart grew solemn, this old monk was very strong, she couldn't see through him at all.</p><p></p><p>She then put down the rag and approached with a smile, warmly greeting, "This Master, may I ask what brings you to our clinic?"</p><p></p><p>Here is the full English translation of the Chinese excerpt:</p><p></p><p>The sudden voice of Tongxin pulled Xiaotong's mind away from the medical book. Xiaotong looked at Jinguan with puzzlement.</p><p></p><p>Jinguan smiled slightly, seeing that the young man on the rocking chair was still with his eyes closed, and said, "This humble monk has come to the medical clinic to seek treatment."</p><p></p><p>Tongxin was delighted, as the medical clinic would earn a lot of colorful spirit stones, and promptly invited, "Master, please have a seat. You've come to the right place for treatment."</p><p></p><p>Jinguan nodded slightly, glanced at Lu Changsheng again, placed his tin staff aside, and came to sit at the long table.</p><p></p><p>Tongxin poured a cup of tea for Jinguan, then winked at the stunned Xiaotong and transmitted, "Xiaotong, the master said that you should examine him first, so get ready."</p><p></p><p>Xiaotong hurriedly sat up straight, looking at Jinguan with some restraint.</p><p></p><p>She had little experience, let alone examining a monk this time, which was a first for her.</p><p></p><p>"Master, what is troubling you? Please describe the symptoms, and I'll take your pulse," Xiaotong said calmly with a sweet smile.</p><p></p><p>However, Jinguan shook his head and said, "Little benefactor, the illness I have, you cannot cure."</p><p></p><p>Xiaotong: "......"</p><p></p><p>Tongxin's brow, which was originally relaxed, also furrowed slightly. Could this monk be here to cause trouble?</p><p></p><p>Xiaotong frowned and said, "Master, you haven't even started the diagnosis, how can you say I can't cure it?"</p><p></p><p>Jinguan placed his palm on his chest, chanted a Buddhist mantra, and then said, "Little benefactor, a monk does not speak false words. If I say you cannot cure it, then you cannot."</p><p></p><p>Xiaotong was a bit dissatisfied. "You haven't even mentioned any symptoms, why have you already determined that I can't cure it?"</p><p></p><p>"Little benefactor, do not be upset. It is not that I look down on you, but that the illness I have is a heart ailment, and you are still young and inexperienced, so I'm afraid you won't be able to resolve my heart illness," Jinguan comforted.</p><p></p><p>Hearing this, Xiaotong resigned herself. Heart illness... She indeed couldn't cure that, as the medical books didn't cover that aspect.</p><p></p><p>Heart illness? Tongxin's gaze grew more suspicious, and he coldly said, "Master, you're not here to cause trouble in our medical clinic, are you?"</p><p></p><p>Jinguan was slightly taken aback, shaking his head and saying, "Little benefactor, you misunderstand. This humble monk is an orthodox Buddhist cultivator, how could I do such a despicable thing?"</p><p></p><p>Before Tongxin could speak further, Lu Changsheng's voice suddenly rang out, "Since it's a heart illness, the world naturally has no medicine to cure it. This master, please take your leave."</p><p></p><p>Tongxin and Xiaotong fell silent and observed from the side. This bald donkey was too troublesome, and it took the senior to step in.</p><p></p><p>A smile appeared on Jinguan's face, and he clasped his hands and bowed to Lu Changsheng, saying, "Amitabha, Mr. Lu, you have finally spoken."</p><p></p><p>Lu Changsheng opened his eyes and looked at him, chuckling, "Daring to play riddles in my medical clinic, aren't you afraid of being sent to hell?"</p><p></p><p>Despite such words, Jinguan was not afraid, but instead smiled and said, "Mr. Lu, from the moment I stepped into your medical clinic, life and death have long been beyond the concern of Jinguan."</p><p></p><p>Facing Lu Changsheng, he finally revealed his Dharma name, instead of continuing to refer to himself as "this humble monk," showing his respect.</p><p></p><p>Lu Changsheng's eyes looked at him indifferently, the Great Dao Eye in operation, and a flash of blue light flickered in the depths of his pupils.</p><p></p><p>Jinguan felt a chill throughout his body, realizing that his background seemed to have been thoroughly seen through by the mysterious young man in front of him in that instant!</p><p></p><p>"Sit down, and today I will treat your heart illness properly."</p><p></p><p>Just as Jinguan was frowning and pondering, Lu Changsheng suddenly stood up and smiled.</p><p></p><p>Jinguan was slightly surprised. The young man in blue was indeed a powerful figure capable of influencing others' fate. In just a short moment, he seemed to have been led by the nose.</p><p></p><p>His gaze flashed, and he couldn't help but ask humbly, "Didn't Mr. Lu just say that the illness Jinguan has is incurable in this world?"</p>

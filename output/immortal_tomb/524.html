        <h1>Chapter 524</h1>
        <div class="content">
            <p>Here is the full English translation of the Chinese excerpt:</p><p></p><p>The literary warfare of the pen and ink, the way of the book to attack the enemy!</p><p></p><p>Of course we've heard of it!</p><p></p><p>Although Jixiang Town is an ordinary town, it is not very remote.</p><p></p><p>The country where Jixiang Town is located is called the Star Luo Empire.</p><p></p><p>Within the Empire, there are quite a few sects, but most of them are martial arts sects, such as the largest one in the Empire, the Tianwu Sect.</p><p></p><p>As for the book dao sects, there is only one, located in the capital of the Empire, called the Beidou Academy.</p><p></p><p>Although the Beidou Academy is not as prosperous as the Tianwu Sect, it is still a sacred place in the hearts of many people in the Star Luo Empire. It is said that many imperial princes and princesses without martial bloodlines study there, hoping to become book cultivators.</p><p></p><p>Martial bloodline is a hard requirement for the martial dao. Without a martial bloodline, one will forever be unable to step into the martial dao.</p><p></p><p>So whether one can become a martial cultivator is already determined from birth.</p><p></p><p>However, the person concerned naturally does not know whether they have a martial bloodline or not, and they need to be tested by the martial sects when they come of age to find out.</p><p></p><p>As for the book dao, it is actually even more difficult, but it does not have the hard requirement like the martial dao!</p><p></p><p>As long as a person studies hard, reads books, they may one day have a sudden enlightenment, receive the blessing of the Heavenly and Earthly Saints, and become a true book cultivator.</p><p></p><p>Compared to the martial dao, the book dao has declined, precisely because the entry barrier is high, resulting in the entire book-martial universe having fewer book cultivators than martial cultivators, and much fewer.</p><p></p><p>Although the martial dao also has the barrier of the martial bloodline, those with martial bloodlines are not that few.</p><p></p><p>As for many who are tested to have no martial bloodline, but are unwilling to be ordinary, they will turn to study, dreaming of becoming book cultivators.</p><p></p><p>And the reason why a dream is called a dream is because it is as difficult as ascending to the heavens, and the vast majority of people cannot persevere and will eventually give up, accepting their own ordinariness and mediocrity.</p><p></p><p>In Jixiang Town, many parents will send their children to the study hall to lay a foundation, to be prepared for the future.</p><p></p><p>After all, before the formal testing, no one knows whether their child has a martial bloodline or not.</p><p></p><p>If they have a martial bloodline, they will be overjoyed, the ancestral graves will smoke, and they will directly send them to the martial sect.</p><p></p><p>If they don't have a martial bloodline, they can only continue to study, lay a good foundation, and hopefully have a chance to be admitted to the Beidou Academy in the future, work hard and struggle, perhaps having a slim chance of receiving the blessing of the Heavenly and Earthly Saints and becoming a book cultivator.</p><p></p><p>So, for all parents, if their children have a martial bloodline, they will definitely send them directly to the martial sect, as that is a direct path to achievement.</p><p></p><p>It would be meaningless to let their children continue to study and pursue the slim chance of becoming a book cultivator, when they have a martial bloodline.</p><p></p><p>The book dao is only a fallback option for them.</p><p></p><p>It can only be said, it is human nature.</p><p></p><p>"Sir, we have heard of it!!" </p><p></p><p>The students exclaimed excitedly.</p><p></p><p>Talking about this, they became spirited.</p><p></p><p>But Lu Changsheng smiled meaningfully: "After you have memorized the Three Character Classic, I will discuss it with you in more detail after the home visits."</p><p></p><p>The students immediately drooped their heads, but their minds became more active, suspecting that the teacher might be a book cultivator.</p><p></p><p>"Let's start the class now."</p><p></p><p>Lu Changsheng said indifferently.</p><p></p><p>...</p><p></p><p>Time passed quickly, half a month went by.</p><p></p><p>The students had memorized the Three Character Classic, even Han Yue had it down pat.</p><p></p><p>Next was the day for Lu Changsheng to visit their homes, so he gave the students a few days off.</p><p></p><p>At the same time, Jixiang Town gradually became more lively, because the Tianwu Sect was about to come to their Jixiang Town to test the martial bloodlines!</p><p></p><p>The townspeople were excitedly hopeful, after all, if their children had a martial bloodline, that would be a step up to the heavens!!</p><p></p><p>In fact, apart from Lu Changsheng's home visits and the suspension of classes, the other schools in the town had also suspended classes.</p><p></p><p>But those schools were not because of home visits, but...</p><p></p><p>Here is the full English translation of the Chinese excerpt:</p><p></p><p>Luchang Sheng first went to the nearest Huang Xuan's house.</p><p></p><p>When he arrived at the gate of the Huang mansion, he saw that Huang Yulang had already been waiting there in person. Seeing Luchang Sheng, he quickly pulled Huang Xuan forward, full of joy and anxiety:</p><p></p><p>"Mr. Luchang! You're here!"</p><p></p><p>"Sir." Huang Xuan also respectfully called out, feeling very nervous at the moment.</p><p></p><p>Luchang Sheng gave a faint smile: "You're quite smart, guessing that I would start the home visits from Huang Xuan."</p><p></p><p>"I'm ashamed, I couldn't possibly guess your thoughts, Mr. Luchang. It's just that after hearing that Mr. Luchang would be doing home visits, I couldn't sleep at night, waiting for your arrival all the time," Huang Yulang said with an embarrassed laugh.</p><p></p><p>In fact, this was hardly a guess. The Huang family was the closest to the Changsheng Academy, so it was only natural for Luchang Sheng to start the visits from here.</p><p></p><p>Huang Yulang had already prepared a grand banquet in the mansion!</p><p></p><p>"Mr. Luchang, please come in with me!" Huang Yulang hurriedly invited.</p><p></p><p>"Alright." Luchang Sheng smiled as he stepped in.</p><p></p><p>Huang Yulang glared at Huang Xuan, then chuckled and accompanied Luchang Sheng in, as if Luchang Sheng was the master of this Huang mansion, and Huang Yulang was the one visiting.</p><p></p><p>Huang Xuan was dumbfounded, not knowing what he had done wrong? Why did his father glare at him for no reason?</p><p></p><p>He then shook his head and glared fiercely at the two gatekeepers, then took a deep breath and ran in.</p><p></p><p>The two gatekeepers: "......"</p><p></p><p>...</p><p></p><p>Inside the Huang mansion, at the banquet, there were many servants standing around, ears open and eyes observing, waiting for orders.</p><p></p><p>Luchang Sheng was persuaded by Huang Yulang to take the main seat.</p><p></p><p>Luchang Sheng looked at the abundant food and wine on the table with a wry smile: "The Huang clan leader is too courteous."</p><p></p><p>"Mr. Luchang..." Huang Yulang was about to speak when he was interrupted by a beautiful-looking woman next to him:</p><p></p><p>"Mr. Luchang, since you've come to our Huang family, we naturally have to treat you well. Xuan shouldn't have caused you any trouble, right?"</p><p></p><p>This woman was Huang Xuan's mother, Zhang Shuihui.</p><p></p><p>Luchang Sheng turned his head to look at her and replied with a faint smile: "Not at all."</p><p></p><p>Seeing this, Huang Yulang felt a little relieved, then slowly sat down. But Zhang Shuihui's next words made him frown!</p><p></p><p>"Mr. Luchang, the Tianwu Sect is about to come and test the martial veins. If Xuan is fortunate enough to have a martial vein, my husband and I will send Xuan to the Tianwu Sect. I hope you can understand."</p><p></p><p>"Outrageous!!!" </p><p></p><p>Before Luchang Sheng could speak, Huang Yulang suddenly stood up, his face as black as ink as he glared at Zhang Shuihui!</p><p></p><p>Huang Yulang's loud voice startled everyone present, except Luchang Sheng.</p><p></p><p>Even Zhang Shuihui was stunned, her face turning pale. Huang Yulang had never shouted at her like this before!</p><p></p><p>Zhang Shuihui didn't understand, she had spoken politely, so where had she gone wrong?</p><p></p><p>"You...!" Huang Yulang was about to angrily scold her.</p><p></p><p>But Luchang Sheng said, "Huang clan leader, please sit down."</p><p></p><p>Huang Yulang paused, then looked at Luchang Sheng with both fear and apology: "Mr. Luchang, I'm really..."</p><p></p><p>Luchang Sheng waved his hand to interrupt him. Huang Yulang sighed helplessly and sat back down, his eyes glaring at Zhang Shuihui like a fierce eagle, full of warning.</p>

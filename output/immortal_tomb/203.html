        <h1>Chapter 203</h1>
        <div class="content">
            <p>Here is the full English translation of the Chinese excerpt:</p><p></p><p>"Haven't you been selling wine for many years?"</p><p></p><p>This is just... </p><p></p><p>Although Lei Yu was a bit confused, he more or less understood the gist of it - it seemed the man was unwilling to sell.</p><p></p><p>"Young Sect Master, this person is no ordinary fellow," the voice of Zhao Huo Fa suddenly sounded in Lei Yu's mind.</p><p></p><p>Lei Yu paused, then rolled his eyes as he replied telepathically, "Zhao Huo Fa, do I look like an idiot to you?"</p><p></p><p>Zhao Huo Fa: "..."</p><p></p><p>"I know this man is very strong, and I even know he was the one who immobilized those Ice Flame Tigers earlier today," Lei Yu continued telepathically.</p><p></p><p>"How did the Young Sect Master deduce that?" Zhao Huo Fa's eyes narrowed as he frowned and sent back telepathically.</p><p></p><p>"Earlier today, I saw it clearly - one of the Ice Flame Tigers was missing a leg, seemingly cut off, and you said it was the work of a single person. Now, just take a good look at the Ice Flame Tiger leg by this young man in green - it's a huge one, you can't tell me you didn't see it!" Lei Yu scolded telepathically.</p><p></p><p>"I'm really fed up with you. You're supposed to be a Huo Fa, but your observation skills are so lacking. It's a wonder my father even sent you to protect my sister and I..." </p><p></p><p>Hearing this, Zhao Huo Fa's face flushed from red to purple... unable to refute.</p><p></p><p>Damn it, he had been careless.</p><p></p><p>Seeing Zhao Huo Fa's expression, Lei Ting knew her brother had scolded him. She couldn't help but suppress a smile.</p><p></p><p>She had a vague understanding of what had happened - that Ice Flame Tiger leg could reveal a lot...</p><p></p><p>Zhao Huo Fa promptly relayed the matter to Lin Huo Fa, whose expression also changed, feeling slightly embarrassed. Damn, she had overlooked it as well.</p><p></p><p>Lei Yu cleared his throat and walked over, smelling the fragrance of the wine and swallowing, cupping his hands and smiling, "Fellow Daoist, we come from the Heavenly Thunder Sect, a first-rate sect. Could you please do us the honor of making an exception and selling us some wine?"</p><p></p><p>Lei Yu was quite polite. He knew the man before him was no ordinary person. </p><p></p><p>And... the two Huo Fa behind him might not be able to handle this man.</p><p></p><p>Based on the various details he had observed with the Ice Flame Tigers earlier, he could deduce that.</p><p></p><p>As the Young Sect Master of the Heavenly Thunder Sect, he was by no means a brainless fool, but rather quite intelligent.</p><p></p><p>Furthermore, he believed that by mentioning his sect, the other party would certainly show him some face.</p><p></p><p>He had introduced his sect earlier, but the other party might not have heard clearly.</p><p></p><p>Lu Chang Sheng put down the gourd and said, "I don't care about your Heavenly Thunder Sect, I said I'm not selling, and that's final."</p><p></p><p>Lei Yu and Lei Ting's gazes hardened.</p><p></p><p>Zhao Huo Fa and Lin Huo Fa's brows also furrowed deeply. This person was truly arrogant!</p><p></p><p>Although there were no insulting words towards their Heavenly Thunder Sect, the meaning was very clear - the other party didn't even consider their Heavenly Thunder Sect worthy of attention!</p><p></p><p>"If you don't want to sell, then so be it. We'll take our leave," Lei Yu took a light breath and cupped his hands.</p><p></p><p>He felt he had been very polite, but the other party's attitude was cold and unyielding.</p><p></p><p>There was no need to insist.</p><p></p><p>The four of them turned to leave.</p><p></p><p>Just then, a sound of something piercing the air rang out!</p><p></p><p>The four of them's gazes shifted slightly, could it be that this person was going to make a move?</p><p></p><p>Lei Yu quickly turned around, looking at the object flying towards him, momentarily stunned, then steadily caught it.</p><p></p><p>Lei Ting and the others looked at the object in Lei Yu's hand, also dumbfounded.</p><p></p><p>They didn't know what kind of medicine was in the young man in green's gourd.</p><p></p><p>"I may not be selling wine, but on this bitterly cold night, I can at least give you a pot as a gift," Lu Chang Sheng said, poking at the campfire with a leftover meat skewer, not even looking up.</p><p></p><p>Lei Yu suddenly smiled, cupping his hands, "Fellow Daoist, you are truly an interesting person. I, Lei Yu, am honored to make your acquaintance."</p><p></p><p>Here is the full English translation of the Chinese excerpt:</p><p></p><p>"Friend! If you have some free time in the future, you can come to my Great Sun Thunder Sect and sit for a while." </p><p></p><p>After saying this, he decisively led Lei Ting and the other two and disappeared into the dark night.</p><p></p><p>He could tell that the man in the green robe did not want to be disturbed by them, and he believed that in this extremely cold ice field, they would encounter him again.</p><p></p><p>Lu Changsheng threw the stick into the fire, leaned back against the tree, and slowly closed his eyes as the firelight was reflected on his face.</p><p></p><p>His murmur drifted in the cold night.</p><p></p><p>"The Great Sun Thunder Sect... I hope your father is not involved, otherwise going to your Great Sun Thunder Sect would not be as simple as just sitting."</p><p></p><p>...</p><p></p><p>"Haha, how refreshing!!" </p><p></p><p>Peng Fangniu took a sip and wiped his mouth with his sleeve, chuckling, then frowned and said, </p><p></p><p>"Ah, let's not drink for now, if we take too long, those guys might get suspicious, especially that little brat Su Qianghe."</p><p></p><p>As he said this, he put the wine jar away. </p><p></p><p>Just as Peng Fang stood up and patted the snow off his buttocks, his hazy gaze changed!</p><p></p><p>Four auras were approaching this place!</p><p></p><p>He didn't even need to think about it to know who it was!!</p><p></p><p>His face changed with urgency as he tried to dispel the alcohol smell from his body!!!</p><p></p><p>"Hehe, Elder, what kind of wine are you drinking? It smells so good~~"</p><p></p><p>The four of them, including Left Qiushen, appeared, and Su Qianghe immediately sniffed the air and chuckled mysteriously.</p><p></p><p>Left Qiushen, Yin Jiukui, and Zhao Wuyu also looked at the changing expressions on Peng Fang's face, not knowing what to say.</p><p></p><p>The Elder's appearance was just like a thief caught red-handed.</p><p></p><p>And this wine smell... they were very familiar with it.</p><p></p><p>There were two types of wine scents mixed in the air, Xihun Liquor and Rumor Liquor.</p><p></p><p>"Cough." Peng Fang cleared his throat, composed his expression, and pretended to speak sternly, "You all actually came over, didn't I tell you to watch the disciples?"</p><p></p><p>Left Qiushen spoke softly, "Elder, Xingqiu and the others are enough, in this extremely cold ice field, no one can pose a threat to our Xiaoyao Sect."</p><p></p><p>Peng Fang paused, then a pained expression flashed across his face as he sighed towards the sky, "Are you all suspecting that I've been hoarding good wine?"</p><p></p><p>The four of them nodded in unison.</p><p></p><p>Of course!</p><p></p><p>Otherwise, why would they have come over so conveniently?</p><p></p><p>"You really don't trust me as the Elder. Two and a half years ago, the Sect Master only gave two jars of wine, one of which I gave to you all to share, and the other one, as the Elder, to occupy one jar is not unreasonable, is it?" Peng Fang frowned and asked.</p><p></p><p>Left Qiushen and the others paused when they heard this, that's right, it does seem reasonable.</p><p></p><p>But Su Qianghe coldly chuckled and said, "Elder, don't try to deceive us. According to what you said, two and a half years ago, the Sect Master only gave two jars of wine, and since you gave us one jar at the time, that means you only had one jar left."</p><p></p><p>"We thought that one jar of wine you've been preserving for the past two and a half years without drinking."</p><p></p><p>"But how do you explain the two types of wine scents permeating the air now?"</p><p></p><p>"Could it be that the one jar of wine you kept was able to switch back and forth between Xihun Liquor and Rumor Liquor?"</p><p></p><p>Peng Fang: "......"</p><p></p><p>Ah, that's right!</p><p></p><p>Left Qiushen and the others were startled, realizing the problem.</p><p></p><p>"Hmph, take it! This is all that's left!" </p><p></p><p>At this time, Peng Fang pushed two jars of wine towards Left Qiushen and the others, then waved his sleeve angrily and left with his big belly.</p><p></p><p>He really didn't want to give it up, but he was afraid that little brat Su Qianghe would go and tell the Sect Master.</p><p></p><p>Left Qiushen and the others did have some awe of him,</p><p></p><p>But as for Su Qianghe, for the sake of wine, he could really do anything!</p><p></p><p>He didn't want to embarrass himself in front of the Sect Master.</p><p></p><p>Damn it.</p>

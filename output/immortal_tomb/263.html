        <h1>Chapter 263</h1>
        <div class="content">
            <p>Here is the full English translation of the Chinese excerpt:</p><p></p><p>Crackâ€”</p><p></p><p>The sky cracked, and countless streams of pitch-black light shone from the other side of the boundary into every corner of the Ancestral Heavenly Realm.</p><p></p><p>The Six Great Divine Continents, the Abyss of Fallen Demons, the Endless Demonic Abyss, and other regions fell into extreme chaos.</p><p></p><p>In this moment, whether they were human, demon, beast, or monster, they were all driven to despair by the apocalyptic scene.</p><p></p><p>They suddenly realized that even after cultivating for countless years, they were so insignificant in the face of such a heavenly calamity.</p><p></p><p>Spatial fragments fell like heavy rain from the sky, and anyone could see that this disaster was terrifying, even reaching the level of being able to destroy the world!</p><p></p><p>Even at this moment, they did not know what had actually happened.</p><p></p><p>...</p><p></p><p>In the Crimson Empyrean Continent, on the Milo Snow Mountain.</p><p></p><p>The earth shook, and countless spatial fragments continued to fall.</p><p></p><p>Yintao and the others stood there, dazed and bewildered, gazing at the figure in azure robes in the sky.</p><p></p><p>They watched helplessly as the supreme Heavenly Dao was annihilated...</p><p></p><p>And they witnessed the arrival of the Ancestral Heavenly Realm's end.</p><p></p><p>The countless living beings across the Ancestral Heavenly Realm likely died without knowing why.</p><p></p><p>But these people knew that everything was caused by the annihilation of the Heavenly Dao by the powerful figure in azure robes before them.</p><p></p><p>After the shock, the hearts of the crowd tightened into a knot!</p><p></p><p>Because the scene before them was too horrifying - the end of the Ancestral Heavenly Realm had arrived.</p><p></p><p>They had to find a way to escape the Ancestral Heavenly Realm as quickly as possible!</p><p></p><p>As for the billions and billions of living beings, they were powerless to do anything.</p><p></p><p>Zhang Shengxu and Ye Wutian exchanged a glance, forcibly suppressing their trepidation as they quietly retreated, wanting to flee...</p><p></p><p>At this moment,</p><p></p><p>Lu Changsheng suddenly appeared in the venue, silently looking at them. "Where do you think you're going?"</p><p></p><p>Zhang Shengxu, Ye Wutian, and the others were greatly shocked, turning around to try and tear open the space and escape!</p><p></p><p>They had no desire to fight against Lu Changsheng at all, as that would be certain death.</p><p></p><p>"Hmph."</p><p></p><p>Lu Changsheng coldly snorted, casually waving his sleeve.</p><p></p><p>Before Zhang Shengxu, Ye Wutian, and the others could enter the void, they were erased into nothingness!</p><p></p><p>The people in the venue were horrified, their souls almost leaving their bodies.</p><p></p><p>They had never seen such a terrifying, ghostly technique, actually erasing living people into nothingness.</p><p></p><p>And the ones erased were not ordinary figures, but peak experts like Zhang Shengxu.</p><p></p><p>Rumble!!</p><p></p><p>The shaking of the heavens and earth grew increasingly severe!!</p><p></p><p>Seeing this, the crowd was frantic!</p><p></p><p>Lu Changsheng slightly pursed his lips, and an ancient longsword appeared in his hand.</p><p></p><p>He then suddenly flung the longsword up into the sky!</p><p></p><p>In the next moment, the longsword hovered high in the air.</p><p></p><p>Just as the crowd was filled with doubt, the longsword suddenly began to vibrate, emitting a resounding sword cry that echoed through the nine heavens and ten earths!</p><p></p><p>Immediately afterwards, the longsword erupted with endless sword qi!</p><p></p><p>The sword qi quickly permeated the skies of the Ancestral Heavenly Realm.</p><p></p><p>In an instant, the Ancestral Heavenly Realm grew quiet, the spatial cracking stopped, and the countless spatial fragments that had been madly falling from the sky were now suspended in place.</p><p></p><p>For a moment, whether it was the Six Great Divine Continents, the Abyss of Fallen Demons, the Endless Demonic Abyss, or any other living beings, they all stared blankly at the sky.</p><p></p><p>But soon, the living beings took a deep breath, enjoying this brief respite from disaster.</p><p></p><p>However, this respite was only temporary, for they did not know when the destruction would continue.</p><p></p><p>Anyone with clear eyes could see that the calamity was not over, it had just been paused for some special reason...</p><p></p><p>...</p><p></p><p>Yintao and the others had already prostrated themselves on the ground. They gazed up at the scene with difficulty, gazing at the sword in the sky with difficulty, gazing at it with difficulty.</p><p></p><p>Here is the full English translation of the Chinese excerpt:</p><p></p><p>The world has come to a standstill.</p><p></p><p>They are parched and their souls are chilled.</p><p></p><p>Everything that happened today has completely renewed their understanding.</p><p></p><p>Chu Lingian and Gu Yinyang's faces were rigid as they stared blankly at Lu Changsheng, the impact he had given them was simply too overwhelming.</p><p></p><p>As for Yuan Yangqiu and Yun Ran, they were even more lost, not knowing where they were at all.</p><p></p><p>...</p><p></p><p>At this moment, in the venue, there were crowds kneeling in worship, with only the figure in blue robes standing with hands behind his back.</p><p></p><p>"Who is the Ancestral Heavenly Divine Emperor?"</p><p></p><p>Lu Changsheng asked knowingly.</p><p></p><p>Xing Tian saw that Yin Yao was still dazed, and quickly poked his back, urgently transmitting, "Divine Emperor, Senior Lu is calling you!"</p><p></p><p>Yin Yao snapped out of it, his body trembling, and he hurriedly got up, taking small steps to stand before Lu Changsheng, bowing nervously, "Senior Lu, this humble Yin Yao, though unworthy, is currently acting as the Divine Emperor."</p><p></p><p>No one in the venue was surprised by the Divine Emperor's humility. </p><p></p><p>Rather, they found it only natural.</p><p></p><p>After all, when the Senior in blue robes had even destroyed the Heavenly Dao, who would still care about a mere Divine Emperor?</p><p></p><p>Of course, cough, the Divine Emperor was still supreme to them.</p><p></p><p>The "mere" was only said from the perspective of the Senior in blue robes.</p><p></p><p>Lu Changsheng looked at the restrained and fearful Yin Yao, his expression softening as he smiled kindly, "Do not be afraid. Since you are the Divine Emperor, you must maintain the order of the Ancestral Heavenly Divine Realm for the time being, do you understand?"</p><p></p><p>Seeing Lu Changsheng's smile,</p><p></p><p>Yin Yao not only did not relax, but his forehead was also drenched in sweat!</p><p></p><p>As the Divine Emperor, he had never felt such a terrifying sense of oppression!</p><p></p><p>"Yes, yes, yes... Senior Lu, rest assured, this humble one will arrange everything properly," Yin Yao gritted his teeth and replied tremblingly.</p><p></p><p>Although he was puzzled in his heart, he still agreed immediately.</p><p></p><p>The crowd present also had their heads bowed, their eyes filled with doubt. Now that the Heavenly Dao of the Ancestral Heavenly Divine Realm was gone, they should hurry and leave, otherwise it would eventually collapse.</p><p></p><p>At least all of them were Immortal Emperor realm experts, they were not fools, and they could all see that the temporary stability of the Ancestral Heavenly Divine Realm at this moment...</p><p></p><p>was entirely due to the terrifying Senior in blue robes' suspended long sword!!!</p><p></p><p>In plain terms, from the moment the Heavenly Dao was annihilated, the Ancestral Heavenly Divine Realm was no longer suitable for living beings to survive.</p><p></p><p>Naturally, Lu Changsheng was fully aware of what the crowd was thinking. He smiled faintly and said,</p><p></p><p>"You do not need to worry, I destroyed that Heavenly Dao simply because I found it distasteful.</p><p></p><p>I am not a madman who would let billions of lives in the Ancestral Heavenly Divine Realm perish for it."</p><p></p><p>The crowd was stunned.</p><p></p><p>"Does the Senior have a solution?" Yin Yao blurted out in excitement.</p><p></p><p>But as soon as the words left his mouth, his face turned even paler, regretting it.</p><p></p><p>How could he have the right to inquire about the Senior's affairs!</p><p></p><p>"Simple, I'll just go grab another Heavenly Dao from somewhere else," Lu Changsheng shrugged indifferently, turning and disappearing in a single step.</p><p></p><p>The crowd was left dumbfounded... immersed in shock.</p><p></p><p>They had heard what? Grab another Heavenly Dao?</p><p></p><p>But since it came from the mouth of the Senior in blue robes, they could accept it, after all, this person had just destroyed the Heavenly Dao of the Ancestral Heavenly Divine Realm before their eyes...</p><p></p><p>"Oh, and none of you are to approach the Azure Empyrean Sword, or if you are accidentally killed by the sword's aura... don't blame me."</p><p></p><p>Suddenly, Lu Changsheng's voice resounded in the void again.</p><p></p><p>Yin Yao, Jing Guan, and the others were startled, and they all knelt down.</p><p></p><p>"We will obey the Senior's command!"</p>

        <h1>Chapter 463</h1>
        <div class="content">
            <p>Here is the full English translation of the Chinese excerpt:</p><p></p><p>The ancient realm of Dong Xu, where a storm is about to break, has finally opened its curtain today, with winds and clouds surging!</p><p></p><p>All the eyes in the entire ancient realm of Dong Xu are now focused on the direction where the He Clan is located.</p><p></p><p>The many lower-tier ancient clans and the younger generations of the middle-tier ancient clans who did not participate in the battle are all praying in their hearts, as they naturally hope that the victorious side will be the one led by the Hong Clan and the other ancient clans.</p><p></p><p>Although they did not participate in the battle due to reasons such as strength, the success or failure of the He Clan's refinement of the Millennium Calamity Body is still closely related to them.</p><p></p><p>After arriving at the location, the Ye Clan quickly counted the middle-tier ancient clans that had come, and then led the many middle-tier ancient clan members to sweep towards the northeast, becoming a dazzling stream of light!</p><p></p><p>The terrifying number of them is simply blocking out the sun and casting a dark shadow!</p><p></p><p>This is before they have even joined up with the upper-tier ancient clans led by the Hong Clan and the other thirty-nine families. One can imagine how grand the formation will be once they unite.</p><p></p><p>...</p><p></p><p>The He Clan.</p><p></p><p>On the top of the Star Observation Tower, there are complex patterns all over the ground, and black flags are fluttering in the wind around the area.</p><p></p><p>"Star Master, the Heavenly Suppression Formation is ready," said He Lian.</p><p></p><p>The black-robed man checked the intricate patterns on the ground of the Star Observation Tower for a moment and said, "Good, then bring the Millennium Calamity Body over, and also call your clan's ancestor to prepare to begin."</p><p></p><p>He Lian hesitated for a moment and couldn't help but ask, "Star Master, how long will it take for our ancestor to refine the Millennium Calamity Body?"</p><p></p><p>The black-robed man said impatiently, "You can rest assured. If it were in normal times, your ancestor would find it difficult to refine the Millennium Calamity Body even after a thousand years, let alone avoid being noticed by the Heavenly Dao."</p><p></p><p>"But now, under the concealment of my Heavenly Suppression Formation and the operation of this Extreme Refining Formation, the refinement of the Millennium Calamity Body will take at most three days!"</p><p></p><p>He Lian was shocked when she heard this! So fast?!</p><p></p><p>She couldn't help but look at the patterns on the ground that she couldn't even understand. Is this so-called Extreme Refining Formation really that powerful?</p><p></p><p>The Star Master is indeed a Star Master. Such a professional formation can be casually deployed by him. In the past, formations like the Heavenly Suppression Formation that can even conceal from the Heavenly Dao were unheard of and unseen by her.</p><p></p><p>She seriously suspects that the Star Master is not an ordinary person of the Qian Kun Heavens, after all, the ancient realm of Dong Xu represents the top combat power of the entire Qian Kun Heavens.</p><p></p><p>"That's good, three days... We should be able to succeed very easily," He Lian said in a relaxed manner.</p><p></p><p>Previously, He Lian was a bit worried that the refinement would take hundreds or even thousands of years, but now it's only three days.</p><p></p><p>In three days, He Lian believes that the group of ancient clans led by the Hong Clan won't be able to stir up any waves, and they basically have no chance of interrupting the refinement.</p><p></p><p>"He Clan Leader, do you really think it will be that easy? It seems you have forgotten what I told you that night," the black-robed man suddenly said coldly.</p><p></p><p>That man named Lu Changsheng has come to the Qian Kun Heavens and is currently in this ancient realm of Dong Xu, obviously to rescue the Millennium Calamity Body...</p><p></p><p>The black-robed man had no connection with Lu Changsheng, but how did he know about Lu Changsheng's existence? That's because when he previously confirmed the identity of He Xitong's Millennium Calamity Body, the memories of He Xitong's past lives also flashed through his mind.</p><p></p><p>Among them, two lives were particularly special, instantly catching his attention!</p><p></p><p>Because in both, there was the figure of a young man in green!</p><p></p><p>That was Lu Changsheng!</p><p></p><p>This Lu Changsheng is extremely special, extremely mysterious, and extremely unpredictable!</p><p></p><p>Because in the memories, the black-robed man saw that Lu Changsheng even destroyed the Heavenly Dao!</p><p></p><p>And he was very decisive and ruthless, without the slightest hesitation.</p><p></p><p>Although the Heavenly Dao of that world is not particularly strong for the black-robed man, to be honest, the black-robed man guarantees that he would not dare to be as arrogant and reckless as that Lu Changsheng.</p><p></p><p>So how did the black-robed man know so precisely that Lu Changsheng has appeared in the ancient realm of Dong Xu? </p><p></p><p>That, of course, is due to his own methods... Although the methods are a bit coincidental.</p><p></p><p>So in this situation, in the black-robed man's view, that Lu Changsheng should be the biggest variable!</p><p></p><p>However, the black-robed man is still very confident in himself.</p><p></p><p>He Lian's heart trembled. Could there be more unexpected events?</p><p></p><p>Here is the full English translation of the Chinese novel excerpt:</p><p></p><p>"Star Master, what exactly are you saying......"</p><p></p><p>The man in the black robe waved his hand impatiently, "Telling you is useless, you'll know soon enough. Hurry up and go make the arrangements!"</p><p></p><p>"Yes."</p><p></p><p>He Lian sighed inwardly, turned to leave, but soon turned back around.</p><p></p><p>"Clan Leader He, is there anything else?" The black-robed man's tone grew increasingly impatient.</p><p></p><p>"Star Master, there is a question that has been on my mind for a long time, and I can't help but ask you about it today......" He Lian looked at the black-robed man hesitantly.</p><p></p><p>Hmm?</p><p></p><p>The black-robed man seemed to look at He Lian with a puzzled expression.</p><p></p><p>"Star Master, our clan leader has always wondered, why are you helping our He Clan refine the Calamity Body of the Ages? What benefits can you possibly gain from this? Our clan leader has been racking his brain but just can't figure out the key, but he believes that good things don't just fall from the sky......"</p><p></p><p>"Hehe." The black-robed man suddenly appeared in front of He Lian, startling her. He then seemed to stare at He Lian, his tone icy: "Who says good things don't fall from the sky?"</p><p></p><p>In the next moment, the black-robed man opened his palm, and a pie truly fell from the sky, landing in his hand as he said mockingly, "Look, doesn't a pie fall from the sky?"</p><p></p><p>Facing the bizarre black-robed man, He Lian couldn't help but take a step back, only feeling a bit more at ease after putting some distance between them, and said in a hoarse voice, "The Star Master is joking, that's not what our clan leader meant..."</p><p></p><p>"Clan Leader He, hurry up and make the preparations. Things have reached this point, all you can do is trust me..." The black-robed man paused for a moment before turning and saying, "Isn't that right?"</p><p></p><p>He Lian hesitated, her sense of foreboding growing stronger and stronger, but the arrow had already been released, and all she could do was secretly be on guard against this black-robed man.</p><p></p><p>...</p><p></p><p>On the other side, the forty top-tier ancient clans of the Hong Clan and Ye Clan, as well as the powerful experts of many medium-sized ancient clans, had all gathered!</p><p></p><p>At the forefront were Hong Wujue and an imposing old man.</p><p></p><p>Everyone looked at the old man with reverent gazes, for he was the Hong Clan's ancestor, a super expert at the Divine Void Realm, Hong Wanjun!</p><p></p><p>As for Lu Changsheng, he was quietly hidden within the Ye Clan's ranks, completely inconspicuous. At this moment, with all the attention focused on the Hong Clan's ancestor, no one paid any notice to him.</p><p></p><p>"Ancestor, the ancient clans have all gathered. Shall we set out for the He Clan?" Hong Wujue asked the old man.</p><p></p><p>Hong Wanjun nodded calmly, "Let's set out. Then I'll ask that old fellow Ouyang what benefits the He Clan has given his Ouyang Clan!"</p><p></p><p>"Yes." Hong Wujue bowed in acknowledgment, then turned and swept his gaze over the vast sea of figures, his eyes flickering as he shouted, "Depart! The He Clan won't be allowed to succeed in their refinement this time!"</p><p></p><p>Boom!!</p><p></p><p>The next moment, the massive ancient clan force surged forward like endless rolling waves, rushing towards the He Clan.</p><p></p><p>"Elder Lu, if the situation turns unfavorable, you must retreat and not be reckless!" Ye Zhuiyue's solemn voice transmitted to Lu Changsheng from within the crowd.</p><p></p><p>Lu Changsheng tilted his head, his gaze piercing through the throng of figures to look at Ye Zhuiyue, and suddenly asked, "Ye Xiumo should have told you that I came to the Hollow Ancient Realm to handle a private matter, right? Do you know what that private matter is?"</p><p></p><p>Ye Zhuiyue paused, how could he possibly know?</p><p></p><p>Lu Changsheng gave a faint smile, "Well, let me tell you, my private matter is to deal with the He Clan."</p><p></p><p>Ye Zhuiyue's eyes widened in shock, his entire body stiffening, almost as if he was about to drop dead on the spot.</p><p></p><p>After a long while, Ye Zhuiyue could only bitterly smile and say, "Elder Lu, please don't joke around..."</p><p></p><p>Alright then.</p><p></p><p>Lu Changsheng shrugged helplessly, then closed his eyes and let his body drift along, feeling rather weary.</p><p></p><p>He had finally realized that whenever he told the truth, no one ever believed him, so he generally didn't bother saying much.</p>

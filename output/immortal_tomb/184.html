        <h1>Chapter 184</h1>
        <div class="content">
            <p>Here is the full English translation of the Chinese excerpt:</p><p></p><p>At these words, the members of the Zhan clan imperial family trembled. üçß‚ô£‚ùª‚ûà≈ú‚íΩùï¶ùêó.ùí∏œÉùì∂‚ô†üò∫</p><p></p><p>Every face turned deathly pale, filled with despair, and a barely perceptible hint of resentment and venom.</p><p></p><p>Zhan Shanhai took a deep breath and shouted in alarm: "Lu Changsheng, if you want to take the lives of the members of the Zhan clan, you'll have to step over my corpse!!"</p><p></p><p>This startled cry, filled with the overwhelming pressure of a celestial ancestor, exploded in the depths of the Extreme Yin Forest, startling countless demonic beasts!</p><p></p><p>On the other side, the disciples of the three sects who were still engaged in battle felt a tremor in their minds. They unanimously stopped fighting and turned their shocked gazes towards the depths of the Extreme Yin Forest.</p><p></p><p>The voice had come from the depths of the Extreme Yin Forest.</p><p></p><p>The mere sound of the voice made their blood boil, for the owner of this voice must be an extremely powerful expert.</p><p></p><p>The Zhan clan...</p><p></p><p>The disciples quickly grasped this key phrase and were immediately terrified.</p><p></p><p>Why was the Zhan clan in the Extreme Yin Forest?</p><p></p><p>And who was this Lu Changsheng?</p><p></p><p>At that moment,</p><p></p><p>another faint, magnetic voice rang out in the Extreme Yin Forest,</p><p></p><p>"Step over your corpse? You're overestimating yourself... You brought this upon yourself, and now you must pay the price!"</p><p></p><p>The disciples were filled with doubt, and before they could ponder further,</p><p></p><p>a thunderous sword cry exploded in their ears!</p><p></p><p>"Ah‚Äî!"</p><p></p><p>All the disciples, including Xiao Yan, suddenly changed color, tightly covering their ears and curling up on the ground.</p><p></p><p>The sword cry had originated from the depths of the Extreme Yin Forest, yet it felt as if it was slicing through their minds.</p><p></p><p>The pain was excruciating.</p><p></p><p>The disciples lay curled up on the ground, eventually losing consciousness.</p><p></p><p>What they didn't know was that after they lost consciousness, a terrifying sword storm had raged through the Extreme Yin Forest.</p><p></p><p>Wherever it passed, towering trees were felled in droves, and many unique demonic beasts perished in the sword storm.</p><p></p><p>.........</p><p></p><p>When the sword energy finally subsided, the Extreme Yin Forest fell into an eerie silence.</p><p></p><p>The Ancestral Beast's domain.</p><p></p><p>The air was permeated with a pungent scent of blood.</p><p></p><p>Lu Changsheng no longer looked at the piles of corpses and blood before him, but turned to face the Ancestral Beast. "Originally, I was planning to burn this Extreme Yin Forest to the ground."</p><p></p><p>The Ancestral Beast regained his senses, his body trembling as he bowed deeply, "Thank you, Senior Lu, for your mercy..."</p><p></p><p>"As for those demonic beasts that were not related to you by blood, I have spared them. However, those of the same lineage as you have all perished," Lu Changsheng said indifferently.</p><p></p><p>The Ancestral Beast remained silent, for he had sensed it all.</p><p></p><p>Suddenly, a mouthful of blood spilled from his lips, and he fell backwards, his eyes wide open.</p><p></p><p>Thud.</p><p></p><p>The Ancestral Beast had perished.</p><p></p><p>Lu Changsheng stood silently for a moment, then turned and walked away, his faint laughter echoing in the space of the piles of corpses and blood.</p><p></p><p>"It's done, and they still put on such a pitiful display. The victims, aren't they me?"</p><p></p><p>Lu Changsheng knew in his heart that these people were simply powerless against him. Otherwise...</p><p></p><p>If, a hundred million years ago, they had successfully broken through his defenses, his fate would have been truly tragic, not just suppressed for a hundred million years.</p><p></p><p>Of course, the "if" was just a hypothetical.</p><p></p><p>Who in the world could break through his defenses?</p><p></p><p>No one could in the past, and even less so in the future.</p><p></p><p>After being entombed for a hundred million years, his cultivation had somehow broken through a certain constraint, reaching a level that even he found unbelievable.</p><p></p><p>However, this did not bring him any joy.</p><p></p><p>Possessing an immortal body with limitless lifespan, yet unable to die, and with such overwhelming strength...</p><p></p><p>He felt that life had become dull, with no real purpose.</p><p></p><p>Now, he would just wander and find those people... and then slaughter them.</p><p></p><p>As for the mysteries surrounding himself, he would deal with them later.</p><p></p><p>Here is the full English translation of the Chinese excerpt:</p><p></p><p>The dense and gloomy forest surrounded them.</p><p></p><p>"Ugh..."</p><p></p><p>Xiao Yan was the first to wake up. He struggled to sit up, shaking his slightly dizzy head, then looked around and was stunned.</p><p></p><p>Shortly after, the disciples from the other two sects also woke up one by one. Just like Xiao Yan, they were shocked by the sight before them.</p><p></p><p>The forest was in complete disarray, with countless large trees toppled, making it unimaginable what had happened earlier.</p><p></p><p>They unanimously recalled the sword's cry and had a vague guess.</p><p></p><p>"This place is not safe to linger in!"</p><p></p><p>Xiao Yan took a deep breath and decisively said, "Disciples of the Tianlong Sect, gather up. We must quickly return to the outer area and regroup with Elder Jin Hua."</p><p></p><p>Zhang Sheng and Leng Qing also hurriedly gathered their own junior brothers and sisters, preparing to leave with the Tianlong Sect.</p><p></p><p>At this moment, they no longer had any thoughts of competing for points. Survival was the top priority!</p><p></p><p>Soon, the disciples from the three sects had all gathered. Some were supporting each other, while others were carrying the bodies of their fallen fellow disciples. Many had died in the previous battle between the three sects.</p><p></p><p>Xiao Yan waved his hand and shouted, "Let's go..."</p><p></p><p>Before he could finish, a series of footsteps suddenly sounded. The group tensed up and looked towards the source of the sound, only to see a young man in blue robes emerge from the forest.</p><p></p><p>The disciples of the three sects heaved a sigh of relief. They had thought it might be someone else, but it turned out to be this person.</p><p></p><p>They remembered that during the previous battle between the three sects, Xiao Yan had sought help from this person, but he had not responded.</p><p></p><p>Thinking about this, the Tianlong Sect disciples looked at Luo Changsheng with a slightly displeased expression.</p><p></p><p>Xiao Yan quietly glanced at Luo Changsheng, his gaze flickering, as if he was pondering something.</p><p></p><p>However, Zhang Sheng and Leng Qing smiled and cupped their hands, saying, "The Extreme Mist Forest has just experienced a shocking change. Fellow Daoist, are you also preparing to leave the Extreme Mist Forest? Why don't you join us? It would be safer to travel together."</p><p></p><p>Upon hearing this, the Tianlong Sect disciples were not very happy, wondering why they should bring this person along.</p><p></p><p>Luo Changsheng originally did not want to bother with them and planned to leave on his own, but seeing the expressions of the Tianlong Sect disciples, he smiled and said, "Alright, the Extreme Mist Forest is too dangerous. It would be safer to leave with you."</p><p></p><p>Hearing this, Xiao Yan raised his eyebrows, feeling like he had heard this voice somewhere before.</p><p></p><p>"Haha, great," Leng Qing said enthusiastically.</p><p></p><p>And so, with the displeased looks of the Tianlong Sect disciples, Luo Changsheng joined them as they set out on their return journey.</p><p></p><p>As night fell, the forest became silent.</p><p></p><p>The disciples from the three sects set up their own camps, lighting campfires to warm themselves. In this gloomy environment, the flickering flames seemed to bring some solace to their hearts.</p><p></p><p>"Has anyone noticed that on normal nights in the Extreme Mist Forest, there are usually the sounds of beasts howling and insects chirping, but after the events of today, it has been completely silent, even now?" a disciple whispered.</p><p></p><p>The others all nodded. They felt an uneasy feeling, as the silence was truly unsettling.</p><p></p><p>Seeing the somber atmosphere, Leng Qing changed the topic and chuckled, "It's clear that during the day, a senior from the Battle Clan Empire and another senior named Luo Changsheng fought each other."</p><p></p><p>"The devastation we saw when we woke up was probably the aftermath of their battle. Those two existences are truly terrifying."</p><p></p><p>"But speaking of which, to dare to go against the Battle Clan Empire, that senior Luo is really a formidable person."</p><p></p><p>"Ah, the Battle Clan Empire... Compared to such existences, we are just small sects and factions."</p><p></p><p>Leng Qing spoke continuously, and the other disciples nodded in agreement, their faces filled with lingering fear and awe.</p><p></p><p>Xiao Yan's expression was also grave, his heart still trembling. They had truly walked on the edge of the abyss.</p><p></p><p>Luo Changsheng sat cross-legged nearby, silently warming his hands by the fire, seemingly unaffected by their words.</p><p></p><p>At this moment, Leng Qing looked at Luo Changsheng and asked with a smile, "Fellow Daoist, why haven't you said anything? Oh, I haven't asked yet, what brought you to the dangerous Extreme Mist Forest alone?"</p>

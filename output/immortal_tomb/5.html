        <h1>Chapter 5</h1>
        <div class="content">
            <p>Here is the full English translation of the Chinese excerpt:</p><p></p><p>"Phew, they're finally gone. 69shu.com"</p><p></p><p>Watching the receding figures of Lu Changsheng and the others, the inn keeper let out a deep sigh, indicating his great pressure.</p><p></p><p>"Innkeeper, I was so rude to the Lord earlier, but luckily that gentleman was there, or the Lord might have taken it out on me. I would have been in big trouble then..."</p><p></p><p>The waiter was sweating, still feeling uneasy.</p><p></p><p>"Hmm?" The inn keeper glanced at the waiter and said indifferently, "Are you blaming me?"</p><p></p><p>"Huh?" The waiter was taken aback, realizing he had said the wrong thing, so he hurriedly waved his hands, "No no, innkeeper, I didn't mean that! Don't misunderstand!"</p><p></p><p>"Your words are useless, I'm already unhappy. Your monthly pay is cut in half! Hmph!" </p><p></p><p>The inn keeper left angrily, leaving the waiter with a bitter expression on his face.</p><p></p><p>.........</p><p></p><p>.........</p><p></p><p>Two days later.</p><p></p><p>In a certain place in the Eastern Domain.</p><p></p><p>Towering mountains, thick white clouds drifting slowly between them. On the highest peak, the clouds only cover half the mountain.</p><p></p><p>A winding path connects the top and bottom of the mountain, traversing the sea of clouds.</p><p></p><p>Near the mountain peak, there are continuous pavilions and towers standing, rising and falling.</p><p></p><p>In the vast sky above, streams of light occasionally flash by, blending everything together in a grand and captivating scene.</p><p></p><p>Qingyun Sect.</p><p></p><p>Outside a misty immortal abode, a young man in elegant robes respectfully reported, "Master, the secular empire in the eastern part of our Eastern Domain is urgently seeking aid, saying there are demonic monsters causing havoc."</p><p></p><p>"Demonic monsters? The Eastern Domain is so vast, and the secular empires are countless, even the empire that pays tribute to our Qingyun Sect is not a small one. Can you be more specific?"</p><p></p><p>An aged voice came from within the abode.</p><p></p><p>The young man in robes changed expression slightly, quickly racking his brain, then hurriedly said, "Master, it's the Lishui Empire!"</p><p></p><p>Rumbleâ€”</p><p></p><p>The abode opened, and an old man with white beard walked out, none other than the ancient Crane Lin who had met Lu Changsheng at the immortal tomb that day.</p><p></p><p>As for the young man in robes, he was also the same one from that day.</p><p></p><p>"The Lishui Empire?" </p><p></p><p>Crane Lin furrowed his brows and murmured.</p><p></p><p>He did have a certain impression of this Lishui Empire, not because of anything else, but because it was the empire closest to the immortal tomb in the Eastern Domain.</p><p></p><p>Crane Lin said indifferently, "Such a trivial matter, let the other elders send their disciples. I still have a medicinal pill to refine and have no time for this."</p><p></p><p>He then prepared to return to the abode.</p><p></p><p>The young man in robes was taken aback, urgently saying, "Master! You don't know, right now in the sect there are only you and a few mountain guard elders left! The other elders have all gone out on matters with the Sect Master, taking many disciples with them!"</p><p></p><p>They can't just let the mountain guard elders make these decisions, their duty is just to guard the mountain, not to deal with these trivial matters.</p><p></p><p>Crane Lin was startled, asking sternly, "They've gone out on matters? I didn't know about that."</p><p></p><p>The young man in robes smiled bitterly, "It was just yesterday, the Sect Master saw that you were in seclusion cultivation and didn't disturb you..."</p><p></p><p>Crane Lin's old face flushed red. Yesterday he wasn't in seclusion cultivation at all, he was practically just sleeping in seclusion...</p><p></p><p>He waved his hand indifferently, "Alright, alright, it's just a small matter. Tongxin, you take some outer sect disciples and go then."</p><p></p><p>As he spoke, an elder's token appeared in his hand, which he casually tossed over.</p><p></p><p>Tongxin quickly caught it, seeing the ancient characters on the token, and joyfully said, "As you command!"</p><p></p><p>He didn't want to stay in the sect, it was too boring. Going to the mortal realm to subdue demons and have some fun as well!</p><p></p><p>"Don't..."</p><p></p><p>Here is the full English translation of the Chinese excerpt:</p><p></p><p>"Thinking of playing, once the task is completed, I'll quickly return to cultivate!" </p><p></p><p>[New 69 Book Bar]</p><p></p><p>The ancient crane Gu He lowered his brows and waved his sleeves as he entered the cave dwelling. With a thunderous rumble, the stone door closed, and the place became quiet.</p><p></p><p>Tong Xin opened his mouth and let out a dejected sigh.</p><p></p><p>Cultivation, cultivation, and more cultivation. He was a genius with a top-grade thunder spirit root, so he didn't need to rush.</p><p></p><p>Hmph, whatever, I'll just play! That'll piss off the master!</p><p></p><p>Thinking this, Tong Xin's face broke into a smile as he happily left.</p><p></p><p>...</p><p></p><p>Moyu Town.</p><p></p><p>The Prefect's Mansion.</p><p></p><p>In the afternoon sunshine, Lu Changsheng sat in the cool pavilion in the backyard, holding a fishing rod and angling in the pond.</p><p></p><p>A young maid stood silently about ten feet behind him, carrying a tray of pastries and wine.</p><p></p><p>These past two days, Lu Changsheng had been eating and drinking well in this prefect's mansion. Chen Dadao had been considerate and didn't disturb him, even arranging a maid to serve his meals.</p><p></p><p>Quite perceptive.</p><p></p><p>"Pastries," Lu Changsheng said, eyes on the water.</p><p></p><p>"Yes, sir." The maid snapped to attention and quickly brought the tray over, preparing to pick up a pastry and hold it to his mouth.</p><p></p><p>But Lu Changsheng, as if he had eyes in the back of his head, softly said, "No need, I'll take it myself."</p><p></p><p>The maid's hand paused, and she trembled as she replied, "Yes, sir."</p><p></p><p>Lu Changsheng didn't even look at the tray, randomly picking up a pastry and popping it into his mouth, chewing as he continued fishing.</p><p></p><p>The maid carefully watched Lu Changsheng out of the corner of her eye. This distinguished young man in blue was truly... special.</p><p></p><p>These past two days had left her a bit flustered.</p><p></p><p>None of the prefect's previous guests had she ever had to personally feed.</p><p></p><p>And this young man spoke so little. </p><p></p><p>In two days, she could count the number of words he'd said on her fingers - mostly just "pastries," "wine," "pastries," "wine," over and over.</p><p></p><p>She had been assigned by the steward, who had only said one thing: this person was the prefect's honored guest, and she should carefully attend to his every need.</p><p></p><p>How honored a guest he was, she wasn't entirely clear. </p><p></p><p>She only knew he was very handsome, and his scent was very pleasant.</p><p></p><p>Pitter-patter...</p><p></p><p>Just then, hurried footsteps approached.</p><p></p><p>The maid turned to see the prefect and the steward quickly striding towards the pavilion. Her pupils contracted, and she hastily set down the tray and knelt.</p><p></p><p>But what followed stunned her - the prefect's respectful tone towards the young man!</p><p></p><p>"Sir, have you been comfortable staying in my humble abode these past few days?"</p><p></p><p>My, my?? The Prefect was referring to himself as "my humble" before this man?!</p><p></p><p>The maid's mind reeled as she pressed herself low, her breathing somewhat constrained.</p><p></p><p>These past two days, she had been attending to some great celestial personage!</p><p></p><p>Lu Changsheng finally turned his head, glancing at the kneeling Chen Dadao and the steward, and replied lightly, "It'll do."</p><p></p><p>Hearing this, Chen Dadao let out a sigh of relief, and the steward also cast a subtle look of satisfaction at the maid on the ground.</p><p></p><p>"That's good, that's good. Sir, you may stay in my humble abode as long as you wish," Chen Dadao said respectfully.</p><p></p><p>Lu Changsheng looked at the rippling surface of the pond and said indifferently, "Speak, for what reason have you come to seek me out?"</p><p></p><p>Seeing the calm, masterful demeanor of the young man in blue, Chen Dadao and the steward were filled with awe once more. Immortals were indeed immortals - their foresight was truly divine!</p><p></p><p>"Sir, your divine insight is remarkable," Chen Dadao first flattered him, then said in a somewhat flustered tone, "Sir, news has arrived that the Lishui Empire... has been struck by a demonic calamity!"</p><p></p><p>And Moyu Town was located precisely within the Lishui Empire!</p>

        <h1>Chapter 322</h1>
        <div class="content">
            <p>Here is the full English translation of the Chinese excerpt:</p><p></p><p>In the vast Eternal Realm, a torrential blood rain poured down. ‚ôô‚ôú‚ùªÔºô‰∏Ç ∞ùî≤ùìß.ùìí‚ìÑùê¶üêôüëΩ</p><p></p><p>This blood rain had returned the spiritual energy and Dao principles of sixty-eight Saint-Emperor realm experts back to the Eternal Realm, significantly increasing the concentration of spiritual energy in the air.</p><p></p><p>At the same time, whether it was Lu Changsheng's group from the Ancient Ruins or Fushi Yu's group from the Shocking Cloud City, they were all bathed in the blood rain, staring up at the sky in awe.</p><p></p><p>Senior in the blue robe... what kind of existence was he? With a single sword, he annihilated the seven great ancient clans - what unparalleled power, what unparalleled elegance!</p><p></p><p>Just a short while ago, that figure in the blue robe had stood before them, and now, as they thought back on it, they were still in a daze.</p><p></p><p>The things Senior in the blue robe had done were truly one shocking event after another.</p><p></p><p>As for the Eternal Immortal Body, they did not understand it, nor did they want to, and they were not qualified to understand it either.</p><p></p><p>...</p><p></p><p>In the heavens, two Dao Lords remained silent. The Eternal Immortal Body - of course, they did not want it. It was not that they did not want it, but rather that they had no physical form, so even if they wanted it, it would be useless.</p><p></p><p>As for Mantic Sky and Jiang Wuxin, they snapped out of their daze and looked at Lu Changsheng in disbelief.</p><p></p><p>The... Eternal... Immortal... Body!</p><p></p><p>It was actually a being that transcended the Saint-Emperor Ranking, the legendary Eternal Immortal Body...</p><p></p><p>Was it real or not?</p><p></p><p>They were still doubtful in their hearts and did not easily believe the words spoken by the ancient clans.</p><p></p><p>After all, how could the ancient clans know about the Eternal Immortal Body, a legendary and seemingly impossible existence?</p><p></p><p>Yet, the ancient clans had spoken of it, which was contradictory.</p><p></p><p>Although the possibility was almost non-existent, the fact that the ancient clans had mentioned it made it a possibility!</p><p></p><p>Especially since Zi Xuanyong and the others had heard it, for this possibility, they would definitely target Lu Changsheng!</p><p></p><p>Whether he was the Eternal Immortal Body or not, as long as they captured Lu Changsheng and verified it, everything would be clear!</p><p></p><p>It was better to kill wrongly than to miss the opportunity!</p><p></p><p>Mantic Sky and Jiang Wuxin took a deep breath, suppressing the excitement and desire in their hearts towards the Eternal Immortal Body.</p><p></p><p>After all, the Lu Changsheng before them was a prodigy of the human race, who had broken through the limits in this Eternal Realm - such a talent was rare for their human race.</p><p></p><p>Under that infinitesimal possibility, they chose not to be enemies with Lu Changsheng.</p><p></p><p>If they were to mistakenly kill Lu Changsheng, the human race would suffer a tremendous loss.</p><p></p><p>It was not worth the gamble.</p><p></p><p>Mantic Sky pondered for a moment and then introduced himself to Lu Changsheng, "Young friend Lu, I am Mantic Sky, from the human race, and many call me the Mantic King on the Divine-Demonic Battlefield."</p><p></p><p>"I am Jiang Wuxin, from the human race, and I am known as the Revered Wind-Sweeping One," Jiang Wuxin also nodded slightly, making a simple self-introduction, and there was even a hint of a smile on his face, expressing his goodwill.</p><p></p><p>Lu Changsheng's eyes flickered, seeing that the two Dao Lords had a friendly attitude and did not want to be his enemies, his murderous intent subsided slightly.</p><p></p><p>There was no need to kill these two Dao Lords, Mantic Sky and Jiang Wuxin.</p><p></p><p>After all, the Five Patriarchs already knew about it.</p><p></p><p>As for the Eternal Immortal Body being known to others, Lu Changsheng did not really care.</p><p></p><p>Those who dared to covet it, he would simply kill them.</p><p></p><p>Moreover, the Five Patriarchs would not reveal the matter of the Eternal Immortal Body to the outside world unless it was absolutely necessary, as it was for their own selfish desires.</p><p></p><p>"Young friend Lu, we do not know whether you are truly the Eternal Immortal Body or not, but the possibility is likely to be extremely slim," Mantic Sky said in a solemn tone.</p><p></p><p>Lu Changsheng remained silent, waiting for him to continue.</p><p></p><p>Seeing this, Mantic Sky pursed his lips and said, "As you can see, the words spoken by those ancient clans at the end were heard by Zi Xuanyong and the others. Even though they are not certain, they will definitely target you for even the slightest possibility..."</p><p></p><p>Here is the full English translation of the excerpt from the Chinese novel:</p><p></p><p>"There is still a possibility of some action."</p><p></p><p>New 99 Books Bar ‚Üí 99shu.com</p><p></p><p>"But fortunately, the divine-demonic battlefield is in constant turmoil, so they shouldn't have the time to come after you in the short term..."</p><p></p><p>Lu Changsheng interrupted, "What are you trying to say?"</p><p></p><p>Mang Tian: "As a genius like you, you are not commonly seen even in our human race. Reflecting on it, King and Wind Xing Zun sincerely hope that you will go to the divine-demonic battlefield, participate in the great tribal war, and make contributions for our human race, but..."</p><p></p><p>"You'd better not go to the divine-demonic battlefield. The endless void is so vast, go and hide somewhere, don't let Zi Xuanyong and the others find you."</p><p></p><p>Jiang Wuxin also nodded, "That's right."</p><p></p><p>At this moment, the voices of the few were relatively soft, except for the two remaining Heavenly Dao Lords and the Heavenly Dao Origin in the shadows, no one else could hear them.</p><p></p><p>Lu Changsheng looked at the two of them in a rather strange way and said, "Don't you two covet the Eternal Life Body? And yet, you killed my juniors right in front of me, and you still think about me like this?"</p><p></p><p>"Haha, the Eternal Life Body, not to mention the low probability, even if you really possess the legendary Eternal Life Body, that would be the pride of our human race!!"</p><p></p><p>Saying this, Mang Tian seemed to immerse himself in it, waving his hand proudly, "What about the other tribes?"</p><p></p><p>Jiang Wuxin coughed dryly and then looked at Lu Changsheng, "Young friend Lu, as for the matter of destroying the ancient tribe, we naturally won't hold it against you. Presumably, they have also offended you.</p><p></p><p>In fact, since we walked out of the Eternal Void Realm, we have not had much to do with the ancient tribe. After all these years, the Jiang Clan ancient tribe and the ancient sage tribe of the Mang King have not even produced a strong cultivator who has broken through the Divine Dao realm, which is really disappointing to us.</p><p></p><p>And this time, the younger generation of our tribe has also greatly disappointed us, daring to go against the Heavenly Dao, narrow-minded and short-sighted, it really makes me angry!"</p><p></p><p>Jiang Wuxin spoke to the end, stroking his beard and glaring, showing that he was indeed a little angry.</p><p></p><p>Mang Tian did not comment, in the divine-demonic battlefield, their human race has actually received the care of the Heavenly Dao Lord, so they still respect the Heavenly Dao very much.</p><p></p><p>Lu Changsheng looked at Mang Tian and Jiang Wuxin, nodding slightly, and found them a little more likable.</p><p></p><p>For him, those who follow me will prosper, and those who oppose me will perish, it's that simple.</p><p></p><p>He then said indifferently, "I will go to the divine-demonic battlefield."</p><p></p><p>Mang Tian and Jiang Wuxin's faces stiffened, looking a little unhappy. This young friend Lu just wouldn't listen to good advice!!</p><p></p><p>How stubborn like a bull!</p><p></p><p>The illusory figures of the two Heavenly Dao Lords also flickered, feeling that Lu Changsheng had not seen the terribleness of the divine-demonic battlefield.</p><p></p><p>Even if he possesses the Eternal Life Body, he still needs to hide and grow, right?</p><p></p><p>The rumor that the Eternal Life Body can live forever is true, but the growth cycle is too long.</p><p></p><p>However, apart from that, just the longevity alone would be enough to instantly kill all the divine bodies on the Divine Body Ranking!</p><p></p><p>"Young friend Lu, you..." Mang Tian was eager to say something, but was interrupted by Lu Changsheng's smiling wave of his hand:</p><p></p><p>"Mang Dao friend, you don't need to say more, didn't you say I'm part of the human race? As a peerless genius like me, isn't it good to go help the human race?"</p><p></p><p>"It's good, but..." Mang Tian said, suddenly pausing, stunned, "Young friend Lu, what did you mean by your previous words? What do you mean by saying that I said you are part of the human race? This is not something to be said, you are part of the human race, the human aura on you cannot be faked!"</p><p></p><p>"That's right, that's right," Jiang Wuxin nodded, stroking his beard.</p><p></p><p>The aura cannot be faked, on the divine-demonic battlefield, many of the tribes act in human form for convenience, and it is by the aura that they distinguish, otherwise it would be a mess.</p>

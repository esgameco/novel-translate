        <h1>Chapter 217</h1>
        <div class="content">
            <p>Here is the full English translation of the Chinese excerpt:</p><p></p><p>As the words of the elderly Immortal Shadow in the azure sky fell, üç≠üíò‚ùªÔºô—ï–Ω‚ìä·ô≠.ùêú·µí–ºüêíüç©</p><p></p><p>In the Violet Gold Realm, the violent immortal energy suddenly surged, ready to be unleashed!</p><p></p><p>This majestic power caused the cultivators outside the Violet Gold Realm to hold their breath in awe.</p><p></p><p>Their burning gazes swept across the three battlefields.</p><p></p><p>"What do you think... the outcome will be?"</p><p></p><p>"How could it be? I don't deny the strength of the Carefree Sect, as its overall power has already surpassed that of a Second-Grade Sect, but against a First-Grade Sect... especially the Great Day Thunder Sect, a First-Grade Sect, they have no chance of winning!"</p><p></p><p>"Correct, I agree with this assessment. The outcome of the Executor and Dharma Protector layer is still uncertain, but the Elders and Disciples layer will undoubtedly lose!"</p><p></p><p>"The Carefree Sect has only five Elders in total, while the Great Day Thunder Sect has a full fifteen!"</p><p></p><p>"As for the Disciples layer, the numerical difference is even greater, not to mention the quality..."</p><p></p><p>"..."</p><p></p><p>At this time, on the Disciples layer battlefield.</p><p></p><p>Tongxin and Lin Dong stood at the forefront, facing the distant Leifeng and Leiying.</p><p></p><p>The gazes of the disciples behind them were starkly different.</p><p></p><p>The Great Day Thunder Sect disciples were filled with disdain and mockery,</p><p></p><p>While the Carefree Sect disciples were solemn, bloodthirsty, and exhilarated.</p><p></p><p>Leifeng noticed the unusual expressions of the disciples behind him and suddenly turned around, sternly shouting, "No one is allowed to underestimate the Carefree Sect!!"</p><p></p><p>The disciples were startled and hastily composed themselves.</p><p></p><p>"Today's battle is of utmost importance. If any mistakes are made due to your carelessness, my Sect Lord will not spare you!" Leifeng said in a stern voice.</p><p></p><p>The disciples trembled, for they had never seen their Sect Lord so severe.</p><p></p><p>"Yes!" the disciples quickly responded.</p><p></p><p>At the same time,</p><p></p><p>Tongxin clenched his fists, glanced at Lin Dong, and then turned to look at the other disciples.</p><p></p><p>This gaze made the Carefree Sect disciples instantly understand - they must win this battle!</p><p></p><p>Thereafter, Tongxin and Lin Dong's expressions became solemn, and a wave-like immortal energy erupted from their bodies!</p><p></p><p>The next moment, they swiftly charged towards Leifeng and the others!</p><p></p><p>"Fellow disciples, kill!"</p><p></p><p>"Kill!!"</p><p></p><p>Seeing this, Leifeng's eyes narrowed, and he led the dense crowd of disciples behind him to meet the charge.</p><p></p><p>At the same time, the Executor and Dharma Protector layer on the second battlefield also began an all-out battle!!</p><p></p><p>Within the Violet Gold Realm, the dazzling spells flashed brilliantly, and the fierce fighting had begun!</p><p></p><p>Boom!!!</p><p></p><p>The moment the disciples' spells clashed, many disciples were injured, severely wounded, and even killed!</p><p></p><p>Seeing this, Tongxin's heart grew anxious, for the ones suffering more losses were still the Carefree Sect!</p><p></p><p>Just as he was worried, a bolt of electricity suddenly exploded near his ear!</p><p></p><p>"The Carefree Sect's Holy Son? Then this Sect Lord must properly experience your prowess." </p><p></p><p>Leifeng's hands crackled with electricity as he looked at Tongxin and spoke indifferently.</p><p></p><p>Tongxin glanced at the other side, where Lin Dong was fiercely battling the Great Day Thunder Sect's Holy Maiden, and then looked at Leifeng, suddenly smiling.</p><p></p><p>"Since I am the Carefree Sect's Holy Son, then naturally I have more value than you, the Great Day Thunder Sect's Sect Lord."</p><p></p><p>Hearing this, Leifeng's pupils shrank, and he smiled, "Then let this Sect Lord witness your abilities!"</p><p></p><p>With that, he flipped his hand and tossed a talisman, which burst into a shining meteor in the air.</p><p></p><p>"Heaven Thunder Talisman! Quickly!"</p><p></p><p>Rumble!!</p><p></p><p>The sky seemed to respond, and dozens of terrifying bolts of lightning suddenly struck down towards Tongxin!!</p><p></p><p>Tongxin's heart raced, and his breathing became rapid. This power was almost comparable to a Heavenly Tribulation!</p><p></p><p>In this battle against the setting sun and thunder, it was truly disadvantageous for the Carefree Sect...</p><p></p><p>Before he could ponder further, the thunderbolts had arrived!</p><p></p><p>Tongxin's hand also produced a talisman!!</p><p></p><p>...</p><p></p><p>On the first battlefield,</p><p></p><p>Peng and the others looked at the other two battlefields, their brows slightly furrowed.</p><p></p><p>The Executor and Dharma Protectors were still doing well, but the Disciples layer was somewhat concerning...</p><p></p><p>Here is the full English translation of the Chinese excerpt:</p><p></p><p>The result was not entirely unexpected for the five people from the Penang faction.</p><p></p><p>However, the elders of the Great Day Thunder Sect, such as Zhong Wuyan, had very unsatisfactory expressions!!</p><p></p><p>Although they had a vague advantage, this was not the result they wanted to see!!</p><p></p><p>What they wanted to see was a complete and overwhelming victory!!</p><p></p><p>Zhong Wuyan glanced outside.</p><p></p><p>Sure enough, he found that the cultivators watching the battle between different levels were all stunned!</p><p></p><p>Whether it was the Xuanhuo Sect, the Tianjian Pavilion, or those second-rate sects, their expressions were solemn!</p><p></p><p>Even the sect master Lei Chengdong's face became extremely indifferent, and his previous smile... was gone.</p><p></p><p>He trembled inwardly and suddenly looked at Peng Fang and shouted, "I never expected that your Xiaoyao Sect... could fight against our Great Day Thunder Sect to this extent!!"</p><p></p><p>Peng Fang smiled faintly, with a mocking expression, "This... is not the limit of our Xiaoyao Sect..."</p><p></p><p>"From now on, the number one sect in the human domain will be our Xiaoyao Sect!!"</p><p></p><p>At the end, Peng Fang let out a startling shout!</p><p></p><p>The faces of Left Choushan and the other three also became ferocious.</p><p></p><p>Boom!!!! </p><p></p><p>Five surging auras suddenly burst forth from the five people of the Peng faction!!</p><p></p><p>Eighth-rank Immortal Venerable, ninth-rank Immortal Venerable, ninth-rank Immortal Venerable, and one Immortal Emperor...</p><p></p><p>And the fat man in the middle... was actually at the peak of the Ninth Transformation Immortal Emperor!</p><p></p><p>Except for those who had already seen through it, such as Lu Ye and the others, the cultivators all had their expressions change drastically!</p><p></p><p>The Xiaoyao Sect, so terrifying!!</p><p></p><p>In the Sunset Thunder Forest, many cultivators who were focused on the elder-level battlefield suddenly became noisy!</p><p></p><p>"The Xiaoyao... Sect, so powerful..." Zhao Ran murmured.</p><p></p><p>Suddenly, she noticed the still calm Lu Changsheng and couldn't help but ask, "Senior, don't you think the Xiaoyao Sect is very powerful? Their strength is already infinitely close to or even on par with the first-rate sects!"</p><p></p><p>Lu Changsheng, without turning his head, said, "It's just so-so."</p><p></p><p>Huh? Just so-so? Is that all?</p><p></p><p>Zhao Ran's lips trembled, and she was stunned.</p><p></p><p>At this moment, the elders of the Great Day Thunder Sect in the first battlefield regained their composure from the shock.</p><p></p><p>Zhong Wuyan's expression was already filled with solemnity and disbelief!</p><p></p><p>Although they had fifteen people on their side, with that Ninth Transformation Immortal Emperor...</p><p></p><p>In this way, in the battle of the elder-level, the Great Day Thunder Sect would most likely end up in a stalemate with the other side...!</p><p></p><p>If it were not for the Sunset Thunder Forest, which was advantageous to the Great Day Thunder Sect in terms of time, place, and people, they might not even be able to defeat the other side!</p><p></p><p>A single Ninth Transformation Immortal Emperor was enough to turn the entire situation around!</p><p></p><p>Soon, he said in a solemn voice, "Okay, your Xiaoyao Sect... is strong!"</p><p></p><p>He openly acknowledged it.</p><p></p><p>After all, everyone present could see what was happening.</p><p></p><p>Boom!!</p><p></p><p>The next moment, Zhong Wuyan and the other elders also burst forth with their auras!</p><p></p><p>Fifteen people, eight seventh-rank Immortal Venerables, four ninth-rank Immortal Venerables, two Fifth Transformation Immortal Emperors, and one Eighth Transformation Immortal Emperor!</p><p></p><p>The surging immortal energy rolled up, but it did not bring much shock to the crowd.</p><p></p><p>For them, the Xiaoyao Sect was an exception, while the Great Day Thunder Sect was the norm.</p><p></p><p>Moreover, cultivators with a bit of strength could all see it.</p><p></p><p>In this battle of the elder-level...</p><p></p><p>The Great Day Thunder Sect might not be able to win.</p><p></p><p>At most, they could only fight the Xiaoyao Sect to a draw by relying on the advantage of the thunder and lightning in the Sunset Thunder Forest.</p><p></p><p>To defeat them, it would be difficult!</p><p></p><p>Of course, for the five elders of the Xiaoyao Sect to defeat the Great Day Thunder Sect would also be difficult.</p><p></p><p>Because the thunder and lightning power in the world would pose no small obstacle and interference to them.</p><p></p><p>And with Zhong Wuyan's Eighth Transformation Immortal Emperor cultivation, combined with the thunder and lightning of the Sunset Thunder Forest, his combat power, although not as strong as the Ninth Transformation Immortal Emperor, was still far beyond the ordinary Eighth Transformation.</p>

        <h1>Chapter 220</h1>
        <div class="content">
            <p>Here is the full English translation of the Chinese excerpt:</p><p></p><p>In the sky above the Sunset Thunder Forest.</p><p></p><p>Hearing the bitter salutations from the Carefree Sect disciples,</p><p></p><p>Countless cultivators' pupils suddenly contracted, their bodies becoming increasingly stiff.</p><p></p><p>They gazed complexly at the figure in blue robes striding towards the center.</p><p></p><p>In their eyes, there was bewilderment, astonishment, shock... all kinds of expressions.</p><p></p><p>This person, could it really be the mysterious Patriarch of the Carefree Sect?!</p><p></p><p>People like Lei Yu and Zhao Ran, who had some dealings with Lu Changsheng before, were dumbfounded where they stood!</p><p></p><p>This was too sudden!</p><p></p><p>This gentle and refined young man... was actually the mysterious Patriarch of the Carefree Sect!</p><p></p><p>For them, it was as if a thunderbolt had struck on a clear day.</p><p></p><p>Especially for Lei Yu and the others!</p><p></p><p>Lei Yu's... gaze had become quite unfocused.</p><p></p><p>In the Carefree Sect disciple camp,</p><p></p><p>"Little, little, little black guy, Patriarch, Patriarch..." Yellow Bin trembled as he transmitted.</p><p></p><p>Cai Xu's teeth were also chattering...</p><p></p><p>The person they almost bumped into on the streets of Feiyu City on the day they joined the Carefree Sect, </p><p></p><p>was actually the Patriarch!!</p><p></p><p>"Uh... he is the Patriarch of the Carefree Sect?!" Fu Mingyan was shocked.</p><p></p><p>A few months ago, when he was presiding over the Nine Rank Sect Competition on the Extreme Cold Glacier, he had called out a couple of times to remind the sects of the time limit. </p><p></p><p>But then this young man in blue robes suddenly appeared, grabbing his throat and lifting him up like a chicken, saying something about disturbing his sleep...</p><p></p><p>He had a very deep impression of this incident, because at that time, he was truly like a little chick, unable to resist at all.</p><p></p><p>"Patriarch, he..." Fu Mingyan turned his head to say something to Lu Yue, but found Lu Yue's face grave!!</p><p></p><p>He paused, then looked at Lei Chengdong and Li Tailing, only to be stunned to discover...</p><p></p><p>Lei Chengdong and Li Tailing's faces were deathly pale at this moment!!</p><p></p><p>The hands behind their backs were trembling, their wrists clenched tightly white!!</p><p></p><p>Their gazes were filled with terror, as if they had seen ghosts!!</p><p></p><p>At this moment, the Sunset Thunder Forest was deathly silent!</p><p></p><p>All eyes were focused on the figure in blue.</p><p></p><p>The bewildered crowd discovered... even the phantom of the Holy Divine Palace's Patriarch had fallen silent at this moment...</p><p></p><p>Then,</p><p></p><p>Lu Changsheng looked towards the Violet Gold Space, lightly pointing a finger out.</p><p></p><p>Crack, crack, crack, boom!!</p><p></p><p>The three Violet Gold Spaces shattered and dissipated completely!!</p><p></p><p>Along with the suppressing pressure on the Carefree Sect disciples, Peng Fang and the others heaved a sigh of relief, then looked at Lu Changsheng with burning gazes!</p><p></p><p>Their Patriarch had arrived!</p><p></p><p>"Patriarch, we are incompetent!!" </p><p></p><p>In the next moment, all the members of the Carefree Sect prostrated themselves in a grand manner.</p><p></p><p>Everyone present was horrified!!</p><p></p><p>The Violet Gold Space set up by the Holy Divine Palace Patriarch, which was claimed to be impervious to all interference, was easily shattered with a single finger? </p><p></p><p>What kind of cultivation was this? Wasn't it stronger than even the Patriarchs of the First Rank Sects like Lei Chengdong?!</p><p></p><p>Apart from the known Immortal Ancestor realm experts, when had such a peak figure emerged in the Lingxiu Heavens?</p><p></p><p>...</p><p></p><p>Lu Changsheng, hands behind his back, swept his gaze over the Carefree Sect disciples, seeing their disheveled and blood-stained sect robes, and said softly, "You have done well."</p><p></p><p>Hearing this, the Carefree Sect disciples trembled.</p><p></p><p>Peng Fang looked up at Lu Changsheng, pointing at the phantom in the sky, and said solemnly, "Patriarch, once the war beyond our ranks begins, no one will be able to..."</p><p></p><p>Here is the full English translation of the excerpt from the Chinese novel:</p><p></p><p>"As the host of this unauthorized battle, he forcefully broke the rules for his own selfish desires..." </p><p></p><p>Su Qianghe's eyes were ice-cold as he glared at the faint figure of the elder, his gaze filled with murderous intent. He growled, "Not only did he break the rules, but this bastard also threatened to destroy our Carefree Sect! Please, Sect Master, stand up for us!"</p><p></p><p>The other members of the Carefree Sect knelt in the air, silent.</p><p></p><p>But the intense suppressed anger was palpable to anyone who could sense it!</p><p></p><p>The heavens were silent, and the muffled rumbles of thunder that had filled the skies earlier had mysteriously vanished.</p><p></p><p>With a casual wave of his sleeve, Lu Changsheng lifted all the members of the Carefree Sect. He then smiled and said, "Do you still remember what I said that day?"</p><p></p><p>The throats of the crowd went dry as four simple yet domineering words surfaced in their minds:</p><p></p><p>"Everything is under my control."</p><p></p><p>While the crowd was still pondering this, Lu Changsheng suddenly turned around. His gaze swept across Lie Chengdong and Li Tailing, before tilting his head up to fix his eyes on the faint figure of the elder.</p><p></p><p>With his hands clasped behind his back, the smile had vanished from his face, and his detached words echoed through the Thunderous Forest at dusk:</p><p></p><p>"To oppress the disciples of my Carefree Sect with brute force, this crime shall be punished!"</p><p></p><p>Boom!!</p><p></p><p>These words, like a terrifying thunderclap, reverberated in the minds of every cultivator.</p><p></p><p>They were stunned, staring at the figure of the Sect Master who now faced the elder's phantom, awed by both his imposing presence and formidable power.</p><p></p><p>Lie Feather and the others, as well as Zhao Ran, gazed at the Sect Master's overbearing aura, unable to reconcile it with the gentle, smiling image they had of him before.</p><p></p><p>How could one person's personality be so vastly different...?</p><p></p><p>"Lu Changsheng..."</p><p></p><p>At this moment, the silent elder's phantom spoke.</p><p></p><p>Lu Changsheng? Could this be the name of the Carefree Sect Master?</p><p></p><p>The Holy Celestial Sect Master actually knew the Carefree Sect Master?!</p><p></p><p>The crowd was stunned.</p><p></p><p>And... was there a hint of difficulty in the Holy Celestial Sect Master's tone? Had they heard it wrong?</p><p></p><p>Lu Changsheng replied calmly, "From the moment I saw you all, I knew it was you. Tell me, in this Linglong Heaven, aside from you three, who else is there?"</p><p></p><p>The cultivators in the Thunderous Forest were bewildered!</p><p></p><p>The situation was developing in a direction they could not comprehend.</p><p></p><p>Judging from his words, the Carefree Sect Master seemed to have a grudge against the Holy Celestial Sect Master... Whoa!!</p><p></p><p>What a formidable person!</p><p></p><p>But why did he mention three people? Who were the other two?</p><p></p><p>The cultivators discreetly observed, and when their gaze fell upon Lie Chengdong and Li Tailing, they saw the expressions on the two men's faces... The cultivators understood.</p><p></p><p>While they were shocked, they couldn't help but feel an even greater sense of awe towards Lu Changsheng.</p><p></p><p>They were not idiots; they could easily deduce that someone capable of having a grudge against the Holy Celestial Sect Master, the Great Thunder Sect Master, and the Heavenly Sword Pavilion Master must be incredibly powerful.</p><p></p><p>And judging from his words, it seemed there were even more than just these three... The mere thought of it was truly terrifying.</p><p></p><p>Among the Carefree Sect members, only Peng Fang's eyes gleamed with a flash of understanding.</p><p></p><p>This scene was so similar to what had happened in the Heavenly Scar!</p><p></p><p>In this Linglong Heaven... it seemed the Sect Master also had enemies...</p><p></p><p>Peng Fang marveled at how the Sect Master could have accumulated so many grudges across so many worlds. It was simply unimaginable!</p><p></p><p>Pondering from a different perspective, Peng Fang thought that if he had so many enemies, he wouldn't be able to sleep soundly at all. Yet the Sect Master seemed to be able to eat, drink, and seek out these grudges one by one.</p><p></p><p>But when Peng Fang recalled the Sect Master's unfathomable cultivation, he felt reassured.</p>

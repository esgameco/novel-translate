        <div class="content">
            <p>Here is the full English translation of the Chinese excerpt:</p><p></p><p>Su Lianyi left with Xu Jiao. They only left after cleaning up the blood stains on the ground.</p><p></p><p>With a light hand gesture, Tongxin's concealment spell over Xiaotong's eyes dissipated.</p><p></p><p>Xiaotong's face was slightly pale. Although she couldn't see what happened just now, she could vaguely sense it and smelled the scent of blood.</p><p></p><p>"If you wish to cultivate immortality, then go. I won't stop you," Luchengsheng said with a smile as he looked at Xiaotong.</p><p></p><p>He had just lightly disciplined the other party a bit, not for any other reason, but simply because they had insulted his medical clinic.</p><p></p><p>Tongxin pursed his lips nearby. He had actually been about to act as well, just perhaps not as ruthlessly as the teacher, directly turning a young lady into a human stick.</p><p></p><p>"Teacher, Xiaotong wants to learn medicine," Xiaotong hurriedly said with a bow.</p><p></p><p>"Hmm, it's actually better for you to stay here. If you had gone with those two just now, who knows what unpleasant things might have happened..." Luchengsheng said in a meaningful tone, then prepared to leave the clinic.</p><p></p><p>He had been a bit bored staying in the clinic all the time, so he wanted to go out for a stroll, since there were no patients at the moment anyway.</p><p></p><p>"Teacher, are you going out?" Tongxin quickly asked, subtly implying that he wanted to accompany the teacher.</p><p></p><p>"You and Xiaotong should just stay in the clinic. When there's nothing to do, cultivate properly. As for Xiaotong, read medical books and memorize medicinal herbs," Luchengsheng said as he stepped out, then disappeared.</p><p></p><p>"Yes," Tongxin and Xiaotong quickly responded.</p><p></p><p>"Xiaotong, you should hurry and read the medical books. The teacher has instructed me to test you on them later," Tongxin said, waving his hand as he turned to go back inside.</p><p></p><p>"Okay," Xiaotong replied, hugging the medical books.</p><p></p><p>Tongxin paused his steps and turned around, frowning as he asked, "Those two cultivators just now wanted to take you to cultivate immortality, why didn't you go with them?"</p><p></p><p>Xiaotong opened her mouth, then after a moment, softly said, "I just like to study medicine."</p><p></p><p>Tongxin's gaze flickered, but he didn't say anything more and went back inside to cultivate.</p><p></p><p>...</p><p></p><p>In an area far from Yanyu Town.</p><p></p><p>Su Lianyi, carrying the human stick Xu Jiao, was rushing away at lightning speed, her pretty face anxious, occasionally looking back, fearing that the azure-robed cultivator would come chasing after them!</p><p></p><p>Su Lianyi was truly frightened. Who knows how immense the pressure was for her in front of that azure-robed cultivator!</p><p></p><p>In all these years since becoming the Holy Lady of the Upper Clear Palace, she had never been so afraid before, it was a feeling of losing control of her life.</p><p></p><p>Afterward, the more she thought about it, the more she dreaded it.</p><p></p><p>That azure-robed cultivator's cultivation... it was probably beyond her ability to estimate.</p><p></p><p>Such a powerful expert was actually hidden in the Yanyu region...</p><p></p><p>She suddenly snapped back to her senses!! Why was Xiaotong working as a medicine attendant in that clinic, could it be that the azure-robed cultivator had discovered Xiaotong's Jade Maiden Profound Body?</p><p></p><p>"Ugh~" At this moment, Xu Jiao's painful groan came.</p><p></p><p>Su Lianyi cut off her thoughts and looked at the human stick beside her... Xu Jiao spoke with a strained voice, "Holy Lady... that person's sword, not only did it sever my four limbs, but it also cut away my ten thousand years of cultivation, causing me to fall from the Golden Immortal Realm to the Celestial Immortal Realm..."</p><p></p><p>Xu Jiao's face was deathly pale, full of agony as she spoke.</p><p></p><p>What?! Ten thousand years of cultivation!</p><p></p><p>Su Lianyi was shocked, quickly checking, and sure enough, it was true.</p><p></p><p>Just now, she had been so preoccupied with her own thoughts that she didn't notice Xu Jiao had truly fallen to the Celestial Immortal Realm...</p><p></p><p>Looking at the pitiful Xu Jiao at the moment, and then thinking about the Jade Maiden Profound Body matter... her gaze flickered, and a strange feeling welled up in her heart.</p><p></p><p>If Xu Jiao returned to the palace, she might very well tell the Sect Master about the Jade Maiden Profound Body...</p><p></p><p>At this moment, Su Lianyi's previously wavering and undecided thoughts, the hesitation between the sect and herself, suddenly tilted slightly.</p><p></p><p>Seeing Su Lianyi remain silent, Xu Jiao couldn't help but continue to grit her teeth, her face full of resentment.</p><p></p><p>Here is the full English translation of the Chinese excerpt:</p><p></p><p>Poison Dao said, "Holy Maiden, after returning to the palace, the Palace Master and the Elders will surely help us seek justice. That broken medical clinic dares to snatch away the Jade Maiden Mysterious Body that belongs to our Upper Clear Palace. They must pay the price of death!"</p><p></p><p>Xu Jiao was very confident. If it was just because of her being an inner disciple, the Palace Master might not pay too much attention. But this matter involves the Jade Maiden Mysterious Body!</p><p></p><p>She believed the Palace Master would definitely not sit still!</p><p></p><p>After hearing Xu Jiao's words, Su Lianyi suddenly sighed. She seemed to have decided something in an instant...</p><p></p><p>Xu Jiao was puzzled: "Holy Maiden, why are you sighing?"</p><p></p><p>"Martial Sister Xu, you should never have told anyone about the Jade Maiden Mysterious Body, right?" Su Lianyi asked softly.</p><p></p><p>Xu Jiao shook her head blankly, "No, two and a half years ago, Holy Maiden, you instructed me to keep it a secret, so I naturally didn't tell anyone."</p><p></p><p>Su Lianyi suddenly stopped with Xu Jiao, her eyes flickering: "You've done well."</p><p></p><p>Xu Jiao's complexion changed slightly, and an ominous premonition rose in her heart as she hurriedly said, "Holy Maiden, what do you mean by this?"</p><p></p><p>Su Lianyi's expression was blank.</p><p></p><p>Xu Jiao bitterly smiled, "I knew it, as the Holy Maiden of the Upper Clear Palace, how could you be impartial and bring the Jade Maiden Mysterious Body back to the palace? How could you be willing to let it threaten your status as the Holy Maiden? You... how could you not be tempted by the Jade Maiden Mysterious Body!"</p><p></p><p>"I should have realized it long ago. In vain have I followed you for so many years, attending to you, and trusting you so much... Even when I discovered the Jade Maiden Mysterious Body, I forced myself to trust you in my heart!"</p><p></p><p>"So... are you going to kill me to silence me?"</p><p></p><p>Upon hearing this, Su Lianyi's eyes struggled slightly, but she took a light breath and made her tone icy cold, "Martial Sister Xu, do not rashly believe others, especially in the cruel cultivation world..."</p><p></p><p>Xu Jiao knew she was going to die, so she sneered contemptuously, "You are just putting on a show. Even if you kill me, you won't be able to get the Jade Maiden Mysterious Body! If you don't tell the palace about this, relying on yourself alone, you won't be able to snatch the Jade Maiden Mysterious Body from the Azure Robe Cultivator!"</p><p></p><p>Su Lianyi's eyes flashed as she coldly said, "That's not something you need to worry about."</p><p></p><p>"Haha haha haha! Su Lianyi! Even if I die, I will tear off a layer of your skin!"</p><p></p><p>Xu Jiao suddenly burst into maniacal laughter, and her body rapidly expanded!</p><p></p><p>Su Lianyi's pupils shrank - Xu Jiao was about to self-detonate!</p><p></p><p>She quickly fled from the scene!</p><p></p><p>Boom!!!</p><p></p><p>A terrifying explosion swept through the mountains and forests, causing many trees to be snapped in half, and the surging spiritual energy condensed into a substantial mushroom cloud of dust.</p><p></p><p>"Cough cough..."</p><p></p><p>In the distance, Su Lianyi was blasted, her white dress in tatters, her pale skin exposed.</p><p></p><p>She was pale-faced, with blood at the corners of her lips.</p><p></p><p>Su Lianyi stared at the mushroom cloud for a moment, then her expression suddenly changed - a few auras were approaching this way.</p><p></p><p>Apparently, Xu Jiao's self-detonation had caused too much commotion, attracting some cultivators who happened to be passing by on their way to a dangerous area!</p><p></p><p>"Martial Sister Xu, I'm sorry." She then took a light breath and disappeared from the scene.</p><p></p><p>Just as Su Lianyi vanished, a few cultivators arrived. They looked suspiciously at the disappearing white dress...</p><p></p><p>This seemed to be like the Holy Maiden Lianyi of the Upper Clear Palace.</p><p></p><p>Shifting their gaze, they looked with surprise at the dissipating mushroom cloud, exchanging glances.</p><p></p><p>"The one who just left, could it have been the Holy Maiden Lianyi of the Upper Clear Palace?"</p><p></p><p>"It does look like her."</p><p></p><p>"What was she fighting with just now? This commotion... The Holy Maiden of the Upper Clear Palace is indeed powerful."</p><p></p><p>"But it doesn't look like a fight to me, more like... a self-detonation?"</p><p></p><p>"Hey, what's that over there?"</p><p></p><p>"Let's go check it out."</p><p></p><p>After picking it up, their pupils suddenly shrank, and they exchanged glances in astonishment!</p>

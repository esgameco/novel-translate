        <h1>Chapter 438</h1>
        <div class="content">
            <p>Here is the full English translation of the Chinese excerpt:</p><p></p><p>"Your Majesty, it's the Great Army of Feng Luan!" </p><p></p><p>The officials cried out in pale-faced alarm.</p><p></p><p>Suddenly, all the troops and guards were on high alert!</p><p></p><p>Yun Cang stared intently at the approaching Great Army of Feng Luan, his gaze gradually growing more serious. He turned to Ye Xunwang beside him and asked:</p><p></p><p>"My wise brother, can you sense it as well?"</p><p></p><p>"Yes, such a subtle yet captivating aura, it must be an expert at the Divine Spirit Realm without a doubt," Ye Xunwang replied solemnly.</p><p></p><p>Yun Cang shook his head and wryly smiled, "Now I understand."</p><p></p><p>"Your Majesty, what do you mean?" Ye Xunwang asked puzzledly.</p><p></p><p>Yun Cang spoke calmly, "Since the ancient Feng Luan nation has experts at the Divine Spirit Realm, they must want to swallow our ancient Cloud Mist nation. Even if Princess Ning is married off, the Great Army of Feng Luan will still attack us soon."</p><p></p><p>Ye Xunwang nodded without further comment. Although he was not a native of Cloud Mist, he had lived there for a long time. Moreover, given his close relationship with Yun Cang, he naturally did not wish for Cloud Mist to fall.</p><p></p><p>At this moment, Feng Changxuan's eyes gleamed with pride and emotion.</p><p></p><p>He never expected his father would mobilize such a formidable force just to rescue him...</p><p></p><p>"Hehe, Yun Cang, now do you know the weight of this prince in the ancient Feng Luan nation?" Feng Changxuan sneered at Yun Cang.</p><p></p><p>But Yun Cang had no time to pay attention to him, for the Great Army of Feng Luan had already arrived above the Eastern Gate!</p><p></p><p>At this moment, the Great Army of Feng Luan and the Cloud Mist Army faced each other, an overwhelming aura of deadly seriousness sweeping through the heavens and earth!</p><p></p><p>Suddenly, the Great Army of Feng Luan parted to the sides, and two imperial palanquins flew to the forefront.</p><p></p><p>The Feng Luan monarch emerged from the palanquin, standing on the platform and smilingly cupping his hands towards Yun Cang, "Cloud Mist monarch, it's been a while!"</p><p></p><p>Yun Cang's eyes narrowed slightly as he cupped his hands in return, his smile not reaching his eyes, "The Feng Luan monarch visits my Cloud Mist without prior notice, and I couldn't prepare a proper welcome."</p><p></p><p>The sudden attack by the ancient Feng Luan nation was truly unexpected by Yun Cang, leaving him in a very passive position.</p><p></p><p>Due to Feng Luan's surprise attack, Yun Cang had no time to gather troops from other regions, so the two armies were not too far apart in strength.</p><p></p><p>The ancient Feng Luan nation truly gave them no chance at all...</p><p></p><p>"Hehe, we're old friends, what's the need for preparation?" The Feng Luan monarch waved his hand casually, exuding a sense of magnanimity.</p><p></p><p>But down below, Feng Changxuan felt a chill in his heart...</p><p></p><p>Because Feng Changxuan realized that since his father's arrival in the Cloud Mist nation, he had not looked at him even once...</p><p></p><p>What's going on? That night in the blue robe, and now his father, it's as if they're deliberately ignoring him?</p><p></p><p>Or could it be that his father, Feng Changxuan, has been abandoned?</p><p></p><p>Thinking this, Feng Changxuan's heart grew even colder, and he couldn't help but call out tentatively, "Your son Changxuan pays respects to the King!"</p><p></p><p>But to his surprise, the Feng Luan monarch still did not look at him.</p><p></p><p>Feng Changxuan's heart immediately sank.</p><p></p><p>The people of Cloud Mist also had uneasy expressions, a bad premonition arising in their hearts.</p><p></p><p>Could it be...</p><p></p><p>Suddenly, a sword appeared in Yun Cang's hand, pressing against Feng Changxuan's neck as he smiled, "Feng Luan monarch, what do you think of this?"</p><p></p><p>Feeling the cold blade against his neck, Feng Changxuan trembled and looked pleadingly at the Feng Luan monarch, "Father..."</p><p></p><p>"Hehe, what do I think?" Seeing Yun Cang lay his cards on the table, the Feng Luan monarch looked at Yun Cang indifferently, "Once I have your Cloud Mist in my grasp, my son Feng Changxuan will be the unparalleled hero who sacrificed himself for the great Feng Luan!"</p><p></p><p>Feng Changxuan's face turned deathly pale, finally understanding his fate.</p><p></p><p>Goodness, just because he was in Yun Cang's hands, his father, in order to avoid being constrained by Yun Cang, completely ignored his own son?</p><p></p><p>And he even beautified it as "sacrificing himself for the great Feng Luan"...</p><p></p><p>Father, this is truly filial piety extinguishing one's own flesh and blood! Your son does not want this so-called heroic sacrifice!</p><p></p><p>The people of Cloud Mist, on the other hand, had somber expressions. This was exactly the scene they did not want to witness.</p><p></p><p>The Feng Luan monarch's ruthlessness truly showed that he had the Cloud Mist nation in the palm of his hand.</p><p></p><p>Yun Cang's gaze shifted to the other silent imperial palanquin beside the Feng Luan monarch, and he asked solemnly, "I wonder what great favor the Feng Luan nation has promised the esteemed one, that he would help Feng Luan against my Cloud Mist?"</p><p></p><p>The palanquin remained silent, its occupant showing no intention of responding to Yun Cang.</p><p></p><p>The Feng Luan monarch, however, hesitated, not wanting Yun Cang to interact too much with the Divine Spirit expert.</p><p></p><p>Here is the full English translation of the Chinese excerpt:</p><p></p><p>The exchange threatened to turn into a crisis, so he waved his hand and shouted loudly:</p><p></p><p>"Attack, and bring down the capital of the Cloud Mist Kingdom for me!!!"</p><p></p><p>"Kill!!!"</p><p></p><p>The Wind Roc army immediately responded, unleashing overwhelming killing intent and roars!</p><p></p><p>The terrifying spiritual power erupted on every Wind Roc soldier, as if it could overturn the heavens and the earth!</p><p></p><p>This horrifying commotion caused the entire capital city to tremble!</p><p></p><p>Seeing this, Cloud Tze's eyes turned bloodthirsty as he shouted: "Cloud Mist soldiers, hear my order, fight the enemy with all your might and defend the territory of Cloud Mist!!!"</p><p></p><p>"Kill!!!"</p><p></p><p>The Cloud Mist army on standby also responded instantly, their killing intent palpable!</p><p></p><p>Unfortunately, even though they were fighting on their home turf, they were still inferior to the Wind Roc army in terms of momentum!</p><p></p><p>There was no help for it, the pressure exerted by the Spiritual Realm expert in the palanquin was simply too great!</p><p></p><p>"Kill!!!"</p><p></p><p>Soon, the Wind Roc army and Cloud Mist army clashed, the majestic spiritual power surging between heaven and earth, each one shining with dazzling light!</p><p></p><p>In just a moment, countless severed limbs and debris fell from the sky like a rainstorm!</p><p></p><p>Cloud Tze kicked Wind Longxuan away with one foot and flashed towards the Wind Roc King, sword hilt in hand:</p><p></p><p>"Wind Roc King, dare you fight me?"</p><p></p><p>Hearing this, the Wind Roc King glanced sidelong at the Spiritual Realm expert in the palanquin, then roared fiercely: "Why wouldn't I dare? Cloud Mist King, I've long wanted to test my skills against you!"</p><p></p><p>Little did he know, at this moment Cloud Tze was communicating with Ye Xunmang, "Brother, that Spiritual Realm expert won't act until the very last moment. When I'm fighting the Wind Roc King, you find an opportunity to sneak attack, try to capture the Wind Roc King as quickly as possible, then... we might have a chance to turn the tide!"</p><p></p><p>Ye Xunmang's eyes flashed, and he nodded imperceptibly.</p><p></p><p>Boom!</p><p></p><p>The next moment, Cloud Tze and the Wind Roc King fiercely clashed!</p><p></p><p>After all, they were both at the peak of the Spirit Martial Realm, and as soon as they engaged, the heavens and earth shook, the terrifying commotion even more violent than the two armies.</p><p></p><p>"Shocking Cloud Elephant Technique!!!"</p><p></p><p>In the midst of the battle, Cloud Tze roared, his royal robe fluttering, and a nine-headed, myriad-zhang illusory giant elephant appeared behind him, swinging its long trunk and letting out an earth-shattering roar!</p><p></p><p>This sight caused both armies to pause, all trembling as they gazed at the nine-headed giant elephant illusion.</p><p></p><p>The Spirit Martial Realm was truly formidable, the terrifying power of which they could not withstand. It seemed that even a single one of those giant elephants could crush them!</p><p></p><p>Indeed, the truly top-tier combat power was on display.</p><p></p><p>"Hmph, the Subduing Kingdom Technique, the Shocking Cloud Elephant Technique?" The Wind Roc King's expression was coldly mocking, but his heart was deeply grave.</p><p></p><p>Truthfully, if not for the Spiritual Realm expert backing him up, he would never be able to conquer Cloud Mist.</p><p></p><p>"Cloud Tze, do you really think only Cloud Mist has the Subduing Kingdom Technique?" The Wind Roc King sneered disdainfully, then suddenly spread his palms, a fierce light flashing in his eyes.</p><p></p><p>"Descending Wind Blade!!!"</p><p></p><p>Boom!!!</p><p></p><p>The next moment, countless incredibly violent giant wind blades erupted from the Wind Roc King's palms, surging towards the nine-headed giant elephant that seemed to have come from ancient times!</p><p></p><p>Seeing this, Cloud Tze was not worried at all, but rather delighted, shouting, "Brother, now!!!"</p><p></p><p>The Wind Roc King hesitated, and as realization dawned in his eyes, a look of panic appeared, causing the myriad wind blades to slow slightly.</p><p></p><p>And Ye Xunmang had already seized the opportunity to appear behind the Wind Roc King, his fingertip transforming into a spiritual blade that decisively stabbed towards the back of the Wind Roc King's neck!</p><p></p><p>Outside the capital, at this moment, even the two armies had stopped fighting, staring blankly at this scene.</p><p></p><p>"Your Highness, save me!!!" The Wind Roc King cried out in alarm.</p><p></p><p>"Sigh."</p><p></p><p>A sigh finally came from the quiet palanquin.</p><p></p><p>As this sigh rang out, Ye Xunmang's fingertip seemed to be restrained by a mysterious force, unable to stab any further.</p><p></p><p>Ye Xunmang's expression began to pale.</p><p></p><p>He knew that the Spiritual Realm expert had finally intervened...</p>

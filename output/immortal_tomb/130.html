        <h1>Chapter 130</h1>
        <div class="content">
            <p>Here is the full English translation of the Chinese excerpt:</p><p></p><p>The words fell, </p><p></p><p>L√º Changsheng suddenly stretched out his hand and made a grabbing motion towards the direction of the ancient Yin-Yang!</p><p></p><p>The face of the Underworld King, who was stepping on the ancient Yin-Yang, changed slightly. In the next moment, he was horrified to find that his body was uncontrollably flying towards L√º Changsheng!</p><p></p><p>Soon, he fell heavily in front of L√º Changsheng. üò≤üèÜ‚ùª‚ùæÔΩìÂçÑùì§ùîÅ.ÔΩÉ‚ìÑŒú‚òùüê®</p><p></p><p>His pupils contracted, wanting to resist, but found that his whole body strength seemed to be constrained, and he could hardly move!</p><p></p><p>At this moment, L√º Changsheng stepped on his face, gently grinding the tip of his foot,</p><p></p><p>The skin of the Underworld King instantly ruptured, fresh blood flowed out, his entire face was filled with a chilling red!</p><p></p><p>Sss‚Äî</p><p></p><p>The entire scene was shocked, and everyone present sucked in a cold breath, this scene unfolded in an instant.</p><p></p><p>An Underworld King comparable to a Immortal Emperor was easily suppressed, and all present looked at the young man in green with reverence.</p><p></p><p>The legendary most mysterious Immortal Emperor Changsheng, was truly terrifying.</p><p></p><p>Behind, Chu He and the others felt their scalps tingle, their souls trembling.</p><p></p><p>They were shocked in their hearts, they had seriously underestimated, seriously underestimated the senior in green!</p><p></p><p>"King!!"</p><p></p><p>Among the Underworld Demon Clan, their minds were in chaos, they angrily watched this scene!</p><p></p><p>Only Yu Shen and the other eight Underworld Kings stared intently at L√º Changsheng!</p><p></p><p>"L√º Changsheng... I didn't expect it to be you, at first our clan chief thought it was just a coincidence, hehe."</p><p></p><p>Yu Shen's eyes were fixed on L√º Changsheng, with a hint of disbelief in his words.</p><p></p><p>L√º Changsheng seemed unperturbed, turning his head and saying, "Wushi, bring the Yin-Yang here."</p><p></p><p>"Ah, yes." Shi Wushi came to his senses and quickly went to take the ancient Yin-Yang from Nangong Jing's hand, and headed towards L√º Changsheng.</p><p></p><p>Although he didn't know what L√º Changsheng meant, but in this situation, he just followed orders.</p><p></p><p>"Immortal Emperor Changsheng..."</p><p></p><p>Soon, Shi Wushi brought the ancient Yin-Yang to L√º Changsheng's side.</p><p></p><p>L√º Changsheng nodded slightly, moved his foot away, and looked at the ancient Yin-Yang in a soft voice: "Since he just stepped on you, you should step on him a thousand or ten thousand times more, and when you're tired of stepping, then crush his head."</p><p></p><p>The ancient Yin-Yang's heart warmed, and he said in thanks, "Thank you, Immortal Emperor Changsheng."</p><p></p><p>With that, he suddenly raised his foot and was about to step down hard!</p><p></p><p>From the momentum, it was clear that the ancient Yin-Yang had no intention of returning it a thousand or ten thousand times, he just wanted to stomp him to pieces with one foot!</p><p></p><p>"Clan Chief! Save me!"</p><p></p><p>This Underworld King panicked, although the ancient Yin-Yang no longer had much strength left, but at this moment, he himself was also completely sealed, no different from an ordinary person. If this foot came down, he might really be in trouble!</p><p></p><p>Suddenly, the Underworld Demon Clan became restless, Yu Shen and the other eight Underworld Kings' faces turned anxious, and they were about to flash over to rescue him!</p><p></p><p>"Stop! What do you think you're doing?!" </p><p></p><p>Yu Shen roared, among the Underworld Demon Clan, each Underworld King was an important figure, he would not allow it!</p><p></p><p>Seeing this, Shi Wushi looked at L√º Changsheng, and the ancient Yin-Yang's movements paused slightly.</p><p></p><p>"You just step on him yourself, they won't be able to stir up any waves."</p><p></p><p>L√º Changsheng said as he turned around, calmly looking at the surging Underworld Demon Clan.</p><p></p><p>Hearing this, the ancient Yin-Yang's gaze hardened, and then, in the midst of countless tense gazes, he stomped down hard!!</p><p></p><p>Boom!!</p><p></p><p>The skull shattered, spraying blood and brain matter!</p><p></p><p>A red beam of light fled from the Underworld Demon's corpse, trying to escape, but was fused into nothingness by a sidelong glance from L√º Changsheng.</p><p></p><p>The surroundings were eerily silent, everyone looked at this scene with chilled hearts, yet also felt a sense of satisfaction.</p><p></p><p>Yu Shen's movements suddenly paused, and he abruptly waved his hand to stop the huge troop behind him. He looked indifferently at the corpse under the ancient Yin-Yang's feet, and gritted his teeth as he stared at L√º Changsheng,</p><p></p><p>"L√º Changsheng, you're courting death!"</p><p></p><p>L√º Changsheng finally looked at him and lightly laughed, "Do you have the ability?"</p><p></p><p>The atmosphere turned cold, Shi Wushi and the others silently activated their immortal spiritual power, he...</p><p></p><p>Here is my translation of the Chinese excerpt:</p><p></p><p>They knew that war might break out again.</p><p></p><p>But just then,</p><p></p><p>Lu Changsheng suddenly unleashed a punch, without any warning!</p><p></p><p>The moment the punch's power was unleashed, an extraordinary phenomenon appeared in the heavens and earth!!</p><p></p><p>The vast space suddenly began to tremble, and in the distant desert, a towering cloud of sand was kicked up, causing the cultivators in the City of Sand to lose their footing and plummet from the sky in terror.</p><p></p><p>At the same time, a massive ominous cloud had silently spread across the boundless sky, and countless bolts of lightning suddenly descended upon the world, leaving everything in deathly silence under the majestic might of the heavens.</p><p></p><p>The apocalyptic scene before their eyes made everyone's faces turn pale as they fearfully looked towards the man in the blue robe who had already withdrawn his fist. </p><p></p><p>What kind of punch was that...?</p><p></p><p>The vast demonic army of the Underworld Demon Tribe immediately became uneasy and terrified, staring in horror at the seemingly ordinary punch that had caused such a tremendous disturbance.</p><p></p><p>At that moment, the transparent punch was approaching them at a steady pace. </p><p></p><p>It seemed easy to evade, but the Underworld demons knew they had been completely locked on to.</p><p></p><p>In fact, their bodies were strangely paralyzed, as if suppressed by the most colossal force in the world, and they could only watch helplessly as the transparent punch hurtled towards them.</p><p></p><p>"Tribal Chief! What do we do?!"</p><p>"Tribal Chief, please think of something! Our bodies seem to be constrained by a strange power - this must be the doing of Lu Changsheng!!"</p><p>"Tribal Chief!!!"</p><p></p><p>Amidst the panicked cries, even the eight Underworld Kings stared in terror at the approaching punch.</p><p></p><p>Seeing this terrifying celestial phenomenon, they knew that this punch was far from ordinary.</p><p></p><p>In that moment, Youmo was not looking at the punch, but was instead staring intently at Lu Changsheng, his eyes trembling as he sighed, "I never imagined you would be this powerful, Lu Changsheng... You cannot possibly be from the Four Directions Immortal Realm. Just who are you?"</p><p></p><p>With this punch, he had lost the will to fight further. He was no fool - he now deeply understood that he and Lu Changsheng were on completely different levels.</p><p></p><p>Lu Changsheng spoke softly, "Don't worry, the Ancestral Celestial Realm that used you as a weapon will also pay a price."</p><p></p><p>Hearing this, Youmo's heart pounded, and he let out a bitter laugh, "Lu Changsheng, I, the Tribal Chief, admit defeat!"</p><p></p><p>Just then, the punch reached its target, unleashing a blinding light at the point of impact.</p><p></p><p>"Boom!"</p><p></p><p>Youmo's bitter laughter froze, and he was reduced to nothingness within the light.</p><p></p><p>The vast demonic army of the Underworld was also instantly dissolved in the same moment, unable to even let out a final scream.</p><p></p><p>The power contained within the punch was unrelenting, continuing to surge forward, kicking up towering walls of sand as it accelerated, shattering the very fabric of space. At this point, the naked eye could no longer discern the punch's trajectory, only the terrifying, thunderous explosions that echoed through the heavens.</p><p></p><p>It kept piercing through, shattering the space in its wake, until a world-shattering sound rang out across the Four Directions Immortal Realm - the sound of something being utterly destroyed.</p><p></p><p>Only Lu Changsheng knew that it was the sound of the Realm's boundary being breached.</p><p></p><p>...</p><p></p><p>In the Ancestral Celestial Realm, a sudden cry rang out:</p><p></p><p>"We are under attack!! An extremely powerful strike is heading towards the Divine King's Palace!! Mobilize the defenses!!!"</p>

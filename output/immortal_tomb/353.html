        <h1>Chapter 353</h1>
        <div class="content">
            <p>Here is the full English translation of the Chinese excerpt:</p><p></p><p>In the human city, a sense of unrest gradually began to build. The news of Zhao Di, who ranked third on the battle rankings, appearing at the Xianhe Restaurant spread like wildfire throughout the city.</p><p></p><p>Many cultivators immediately realized that Senior Zhao Di must have gone there to cause trouble for that Lu Changsheng.</p><p></p><p>And so, countless cultivators swarmed towards the center of the city, towards the Xianhe Restaurant, like a plague of locusts.</p><p></p><p>In an instant, the sky was filled with flying figures, the ground was covered with running figures, and the crowd surged forward.</p><p></p><p>...</p><p></p><p>Outside the Xianhe Restaurant, the area was now densely packed with people. </p><p></p><p>All eyes were focused on the figure standing in front of the Xianhe Restaurant - Senior Zhao Di, the third ranked on the battle rankings!</p><p></p><p>Beside him stood the top thirty Shenjuan realm experts on the battle rankings, including Moluang Qiu, Shuiting Hen, Miu Fan, and Kong Zhen.</p><p></p><p>Although they were fierce competitors normally, as fellow members of the human race, they had a decent relationship behind the scenes. They were truly worried that Zhao Di's actions today would anger the two human lords.</p><p></p><p>The manager of the Xianhe Restaurant was in a panic, sighing over the karmic retribution he must have accumulated in his past life. First the arrival of the Golden Wheel King, and now the entire top thirty Shenjuan realm experts - his little Xianhe Restaurant couldn't withstand this!</p><p></p><p>Despite the sea of people, an eerie silence had fallen. No one dared to make a sound.</p><p></p><p>"Zhao Di, why don't you just let it go?" Shuiting Hen said, staring intently at Zhao Di.</p><p></p><p>Zhao Di shook his head slightly, then suddenly lifted his head and let out a loud shout:</p><p></p><p>"I, Zhao Di, ranked third on the battle rankings, have come to seek guidance!"</p><p></p><p>At these words, the entire crowd was stunned. </p><p></p><p>Moluang Qiu and the others could only shake their heads helplessly - it seemed Zhao Di's battle today was inevitable.</p><p></p><p>As for the surrounding crowd, their faces flushed red and their breathing quickened in anticipation.</p><p></p><p>...</p><p></p><p>Inside the restaurant,</p><p></p><p>Old Gui and Li Shuyan came to the door of Lu Changsheng's room. Old Gui gently knocked on the door and bowed respectfully:</p><p></p><p>"Master, there is someone causing a commotion outside. Should I go teach them a lesson?"</p><p></p><p>"No need. You and Shuyan can continue your cultivation downstairs."</p><p></p><p>Hearing the voice from within the room, Old Gui and Li Shuyan exchanged a glance, then respectfully withdrew.</p><p></p><p>Inside the room,</p><p></p><p>Lu Changsheng slowly got up from the bed and walked over to the window, opening it.</p><p></p><p>In the quiet space, the sound of the window opening was exceptionally clear.</p><p></p><p>In an instant, countless gazes turned towards the source of the sound!</p><p></p><p>They saw a young man in blue robes standing behind the window, his eyes calmly surveying the scene below.</p><p></p><p>Ah, it's him?!</p><p></p><p>Many of the cultivators who had witnessed the battle between Miu Fan and Kong Zhen had their pupils constrict in recognition.</p><p></p><p>They were all too familiar with this figure in blue robes!</p><p></p><p>Unexpectedly, this mysterious person who had replaced Zhao Di's spot in the Seven-Colored Jade Pagoda was none other than him...</p><p></p><p>At the same time, </p><p></p><p>Moluang Qiu, Shuiting Hen, Zhao Di and the other top thirty Shenjuan realm experts were all carefully scrutinizing the young man in blue.</p><p></p><p>They all shared the same thought - when had the human race produced such a powerful Shenjuan realm expert, one they had never even heard of before?</p><p></p><p>As for Miu Fan and Kong Zhen, their expressions flickered with a hint of unease, especially Kong Zhen, who still vividly remembered how his mind had been strangely controlled that day.</p><p></p><p>Behind the window, Lu Changsheng's gaze swept across the crowd, finally resting on Zhao Di. He simply stood there, silently observing.</p><p></p><p>This scene left the onlookers deeply shaken.</p><p></p><p>Facing these thirty Shenjuan realm experts, who represented nearly a third of the human race's core combat power, this young man in blue robes showed no signs of trepidation. Instead, he exuded an aura of calm control, almost like that of a monarch.</p><p></p><p>This aura was one they had only ever witnessed in the five human lords. </p><p></p><p>In fact, this person seemed even more unique - while the human lords possessed a domineering, tyrannical might, this young man gave off the impression of a quiet, controlling presence.</p><p></p><p>Here is the full English translation of the Chinese excerpt:</p><p></p><p>It's no wonder the Ruler pushed him forward. Just from his outward appearance, he's clearly no ordinary person!</p><p></p><p>At the very least, Zhao Di was completely overwhelmed in terms of aura and presence.</p><p></p><p>This was the true reflection of everyone's thoughts.</p><p></p><p>"Fellow Daoist Lu, it's not that Zhao Di is causing a ruckus, but rather he has invested a lot for the spot in the Seven-Colored Glazed Pagoda. After learning that he was not selected, he felt a bit unwilling, so he has come to seek your guidance today."</p><p></p><p>Zhao Di cupped his hands and took a light breath before continuing:</p><p></p><p>"If Fellow Daoist Lu is stronger than me, then in this battlefield where the strong prevail, I, Zhao Di, will accept it wholeheartedly. More importantly, this is about the performance of our human race in the Seven-Colored Glazed Pagoda!"</p><p></p><p>Upon hearing this, the people around nodded slightly, and their gazes towards Zhao Di were filled with reverence.</p><p></p><p>Lu Changsheng gently nodded, and then, in the bewildered gaze of the crowd, he extended his hand and lightly pressed down.</p><p></p><p>Boom!!</p><p></p><p>An irresistible, tremendous force descended upon Zhao Di!!</p><p></p><p>The bystanders' expressions were still puzzled, but Zhao Di's face changed drastically!!</p><p></p><p>As the tremendous force grew stronger, he finally could not withstand it and knelt down on one knee...</p><p></p><p>Boom!</p><p></p><p>Rumble!</p><p></p><p>The ground shattered and cracked, spreading in all directions!</p><p></p><p>Crack, crack, crack, crack...</p><p></p><p>Mu Lianqiu and the others lowered their heads, staring in shock at the cracks beneath their feet...</p><p></p><p>The people around were startled, dumbfounded, what had happened?</p><p></p><p>In an instant, the sound of people gasping in disbelief echoed ceaselessly!</p><p></p><p>What did this mean for Senior Zhao Di?</p><p></p><p>The air around the Xianhe Tavern had completely solidified, and the environment was deathly silent.</p><p></p><p>Zhao Di painfully raised his head, looking at the young man in green by the window with disbelief. They were both at the Shenxuan Realm, yet the gap was so vast...</p><p></p><p>As a late-stage Shenxuan Realm cultivator, he belonged to the group with formidable combat power, even able to contend with the typical peak Shenxuan Realm experts.</p><p></p><p>Why... why?</p><p></p><p>The fact that this Lu Changsheng could participate in the Seven-Colored Glazed Pagoda meant his cultivation level had not exceeded the Shenxuan Realm.</p><p></p><p>Even if this Lu Changsheng was at the peak of the Shenxuan Realm, Zhao Di should not have been defeated so easily, right?</p><p></p><p>With such combat power, even the peak Shenxuan Realm experts from the other races ranked high on the Myriad Tribes Ranking would not be much different, right?</p><p></p><p>When did our human race produce such an extraordinary figure?</p><p></p><p>This was not only Zhao Di's thought, but also the thought of all the powerful experts present!</p><p></p><p>At this moment, Zhao Di shakily stood up and cupped his hands, saying:</p><p></p><p>"Fellow Daoist Lu, I, Zhao Di, submit to you wholeheartedly. Thank you for your restraint. With a person like Fellow Daoist Lu, it is a blessing for our human race."</p><p></p><p>Lu Changsheng nodded slightly and then closed the window in the gaze of the crowd.</p><p></p><p>Zhao Di let out a relieved sigh, then revealed a wry smile. It happened too quickly... he was suppressed without even doing anything...</p><p></p><p>Mu Lianqiu's brow furrowed as he looked around at the others, then sternly commanded, "Disperse!"</p><p></p><p>Hearing this, the cultivators snapped out of their daze and hastily left the area, bowing respectfully to Mu Lianqiu and the others before departing.</p><p></p><p>Once the place became empty, Shuiting looked at Zhao Di and asked, "Are you alright?"</p><p></p><p>Miao Fan, Kong Zhen, and the other powerful experts remained silent, their gazes occasionally glancing towards the window of the tavern, utterly shocked!</p><p></p><p>Was this really the Shenxuan Realm?</p><p></p><p>"Haha, you all don't need to worry about me. I was simply outmatched, there's nothing to be said about it. In the end, Fellow Daoist Lu will be more useful for our human race in the Seven-Colored Glazed Pagoda than I, Zhao Di. I'm not that petty-minded."</p><p></p><p>Zhao Di sighed lightly, then took one last look at the window before waving his hand and departing into the air.</p><p></p><p>Today, he had been thoroughly defeated, subdued with a single move... it was so embarrassing.</p><p></p><p>Now, he needed to go to the Imperial Palace and apologize to the two Rulers!</p><p></p><p>Seeing this, Mu Lianqiu and the others exchanged wry smiles, then cautiously glanced at the window one last time before leaving together.</p>

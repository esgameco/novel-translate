        <h1>Chapter 237</h1>
        <div class="content">
            <p>Here is the full English translation of the Chinese excerpt:</p><p></p><p>The medicinal power instantly spread through his lower abdomen. Wingdings: ‚åõÔ∏éüñ≤Ô∏é‚¨ßÔ∏é‚ôíÔ∏é‚óÜÔ∏é‚åßÔ∏éüì¨Ô∏é‚ôçÔ∏é‚ñ°Ô∏é‚ùçÔ∏é</p><p></p><p>Luo Gu immediately felt much better, his whole body relaxing as he lost strength.</p><p></p><p>"Doctor Lu, thank you for your trouble," Luo Gu said weakly.</p><p></p><p>Lu Changsheng nodded and came to sit down on the rocking chair. Tongxin saw this and went to help Luo Gu over to the long table, pouring him a cup of hot tea.</p><p></p><p>Luo Gu picked up the tea cup, giving a wry smile. "Tongxin, thank you."</p><p></p><p>Beside them, little Tong frowned, deep in thought, then couldn't help but come over with paper and pen. "Grandpa Luo, what illness do you have? Little Tong wants to record it."</p><p></p><p>Luo Gu's expression changed slightly, feeling embarrassed. "Tong'er, Grandpa Luo just has a stomachache."</p><p></p><p>After saying that, he didn't dare drink the tea anymore, quickly standing up and giving a salute to Lu Changsheng, then slipping out of the clinic under Tong's puzzled gaze.</p><p></p><p>.........</p><p></p><p>Upper Clarity Palace.</p><p></p><p>These days, Yun Mi was very troubled. </p><p></p><p>She had exhausted all her methods but still couldn't ferret out the mole among the elders.</p><p></p><p>At this time, in the main hall of the Upper Clarity Palace.</p><p></p><p>Yun Mi sat in the main seat, with many elders standing on both sides, their heads bowed in silence, brows furrowed.</p><p></p><p>Recently, the elders were also troubled.</p><p></p><p>They didn't know what medicine the Mistress had taken wrong, insisting on finding some mole among them.</p><p></p><p>Heavens and earth, they were truly innocent!</p><p></p><p>Born as Upper Clarity Palace disciples, they would die as Upper Clarity Palace ghosts - how could they betray the palace?</p><p></p><p>"Mistress, our loyalty is as bright as the full moon. Why do you... don't make the hearts of us elders grow cold..." </p><p></p><p>The Grand Elder struggled for a long time before standing out and bowing as he spoke.</p><p></p><p>The other elders were also puzzled when they heard this. They had all been questioned, so what else could be done? </p><p></p><p>Could it be that they would have to undergo soul-searching?</p><p></p><p>If the Mistress really made them undergo soul-searching, they would be thoroughly disheartened.</p><p></p><p>Yun Mi rubbed her brow and sighed. "Lianyi and Xu Jiao went out and were attacked by a mysterious expert. Xu Jiao perished, and even Lianyi was almost... Besides this palace and the elders, who else knew that Lianyi went out?"</p><p></p><p>The elders were shocked to hear this.</p><p></p><p>So it was their Upper Clarity Palace's Saint Girl who had almost been attacked?</p><p></p><p>Xu Jiao's death, after all, was also the death of an inner disciple, and they had heard about it, but didn't pay much attention. </p><p></p><p>In their Upper Clarity Palace, inner and outer disciples died every now and then, which was normal.</p><p></p><p>Only when a core disciple died would they pay close attention.</p><p></p><p>They just didn't expect Xu Jiao to have been attacked together with the Saint Girl.</p><p></p><p>No wonder the Mistress was suspicious of them...</p><p></p><p>Not to mention the Mistress's suspicion, after learning of this, they all started glancing at each other, secretly becoming vigilant and wary.</p><p></p><p>"What do the elders suggest?" Yun Mi said faintly.</p><p></p><p>The elders' eyes flickered, this was too difficult, they had even questioned themselves, where could they find a solution?</p><p></p><p>"Lianyi is our Upper Clarity Palace's Saint Girl. She almost met with disaster, this matter must have an explanation." Yun Mi's eyes narrowed as she swept her gaze over the crowd and continued, "The only two sects that have enmity with our Upper Clarity Palace are Qiqing Valley and Yangxuan Sect..."</p><p></p><p>"In three days, the elders will accompany this palace to Qiqing Valley to demand an explanation."</p><p></p><p>Since she couldn't ferret out the mole, she would directly confront them.</p><p></p><p>As for Yangxuan Sect, Yun Mi temporarily excluded them, as she vaguely knew that that fellow Yuan Yang Qiu had been infatuated with Lianyi for a long time, so the possibility of him attacking Lianyi was not high.</p><p></p><p>How did she know this?</p><p></p><p>Because Yuan Yang Qiu had mentioned more than once that he wanted to become Lianyi's cultivation partner, but had all been rejected by her.</p><p></p><p>"Yes, Mistress."</p><p></p><p>The elders immediately responded, even if they had doubts and didn't understand why the Mistress had determined that Qiqing Valley was the attacker, rather than Yangxuan Sect.</p><p></p><p>.........</p><p></p><p>Time passed another ten days.</p><p></p><p>On this day, Yanwu Town welcomed an uninvited guest.</p><p></p><p>Yuan Yang Qiu stood alone in the sky outside Yanwu Town.</p><p></p><p>He looked down at the small town, muttering to himself, "It should be here."</p><p></p><p>Soon, his gaze was fixed on a courtyard in the southwest of the town...</p><p></p><p>Then his figure moved, heading in that direction.</p><p></p><p>A moment later,</p><p></p><p>"To heal the illnesses of the common people, the sickness of cultivators..."</p><p></p><p>Here is the full English translation of the Chinese excerpt:</p><p></p><p>"What?" </p><p></p><p>Yuanyang Qiu looked at the banner, his gaze filled with surprise. Suddenly, a hint of interest stirred within him.</p><p></p><p>He quickly composed himself, a smile appearing on his face as he walked into the medical clinic.</p><p></p><p>At this moment, there was a patient inside the clinic being examined by Xiao Tong.</p><p></p><p>Lu Changsheng was sitting aside, sipping tea and observing calmly.</p><p></p><p>The woman felt a bit anxious. She glanced at the focused Xiao Tong, then turned to Lu Changsheng, asking awkwardly, "Doctor Lu, is Tong'er really capable of this?"</p><p></p><p>It wasn't that she didn't trust Xiao Tong, but the girl had only been at the clinic for a short while. How could she already be practicing medicine?</p><p></p><p>If Doctor Lu wasn't here watching over them, she would be truly worried, after all, Xiao Tong was just a little girl.</p><p></p><p>Lu Changsheng smiled, "Don't worry, I'm here. You need not be concerned."</p><p></p><p>Xiao Tong pouted at the woman, whispering, "Auntie, just trust Tong'er this time, okay?"</p><p></p><p>The woman coughed dryly, patting Xiao Tong's head, "Alright, alright, go ahead and examine me. I'll consider this practice for you."</p><p></p><p>Xiao Tong giggled, then quickly composed her expression, placing her small hand on the woman and carefully taking her pulse, her face serious.</p><p></p><p>To be honest, the woman was a bit startled by Xiao Tong's grave demeanor. Could her illness be that serious?</p><p></p><p>Just then, Yuanyang Qiu entered the clinic.</p><p></p><p>Before he could speak, Lu Changsheng glanced at him and said, "Please have a seat over there and wait while you drink some tea."</p><p></p><p>Yuanyang Qiu paused, his smile fading as he silently came to the long table behind Lu Changsheng and sat down. He poured himself a cup of hot tea and began observing the clinic...</p><p></p><p>His gaze finally settled on the focused Xiao Tong.</p><p></p><p>"Ah~" Yuanyang Qiu unconsciously took a sip of the tea.</p><p></p><p>Immediately, his expression changed, and he stared at the tea in shock. What kind of tea was this??</p><p></p><p>He had only taken a small sip, but he could feel his immortal qi stirring restlessly within, as if demanding, "More! Give me more!!"</p><p></p><p>Without hesitation, he tilted his head back and drained the cup in one gulp.</p><p></p><p>Boom!!!</p><p></p><p>The violent immortal qi suddenly exploded within him!</p><p></p><p>At the same time, in the sky above Yanyu Town, dark clouds gathered, and thunderous rumbles echoed.</p><p></p><p>The townspeople looked up at the ominous sky, their mouths agape in shock and fear. What was happening? Just a moment ago, it had been clear, and now it had transformed like this. They had never witnessed such a terrifying sight before. It felt as if their town was about to be destroyed by the raging thunderstorm.</p><p></p><p>Could it be that the rumored demonic creatures had come to attack their town?</p><p></p><p>Frightened, the townspeople hurried back to their homes, tightly shutting their doors and windows, trembling.</p><p></p><p>In the clinic, Lu Changsheng turned his head slightly and said softly, "If you undergo the tribulation here, and it affects the townspeople, I'm afraid your end will be most tragic."</p><p></p><p>Yuanyang Qiu snapped out of his daze, staring at the side of Lu Changsheng's face in horror. His carefully laid plans had been completely upended.</p><p></p><p>"D-Doctor, I'll go find a remote, desolate place to undergo the tribulation..."</p><p></p><p>Yuanyang Qiu said awkwardly, glancing nervously at Lu Changsheng before vanishing from the clinic.</p><p></p><p>"Sir, the thunderstorm outside is raging. It seems there is a cultivator undergoing a tribulation in this area," the young servant, Tong Xin, ran in and reported respectfully to Lu Changsheng.</p><p></p><p>Lu Changsheng waved his hand, "Never mind."</p><p></p><p>"Understood." Tong Xin bowed and hurried back to the herb garden.</p><p></p><p>Xiao Tong was still focused on her diagnosis.</p><p></p><p>As for the woman, she stared at Lu Changsheng, her face pale with shock. She had just witnessed that middle-aged man disappear with her own eyes and heard their conversation.</p><p></p><p>Lu Changsheng... was actually a cultivator??</p><p></p><p>Thinking about this, her expression turned fearful. After all, she had also been part of the group that had cornered him recently.</p>

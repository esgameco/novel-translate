        <h1>Chapter 372</h1>
        <div class="content">
            <p>Here is the full English translation of the Chinese excerpt:</p><p></p><p>Outside the Demon Subduing Tower in the Great Dao Realm, the people of the Human Tribe were being watched with bated breath by the countless other tribes. Their expressions were strained, their faces pale.</p><p></p><p>Even Jiang Wuxin and Han Jinlong, the two leaders, were on the verge of collapse at this moment.</p><p></p><p>Just earlier, Fang Yin had told them everything that had happened inside the Seven-Colored Crystal Tower.</p><p></p><p>The Immortal Dao Companion had not only instructed Fang Yin and the others to collect all the Crystal Hearts, but had also wiped out thousands of Mystic Immortal Realm experts from other tribes, including the Holy Son of the Nether Snake Tribe.</p><p></p><p>Experts at the Mystic Immortal Realm are invaluable to any tribe. It can be said that from now on, the Human Tribe will definitely become the public enemy of all tribes in the Divine-Demonic Battlefield...</p><p></p><p>What merit or virtue do the humans possess?</p><p></p><p>Furthermore, according to Fang Yin's description, the Immortal Dao Companion's strength is absolutely above the Mystic Immortal Realm! Even in the Mystic Immortal Realm, he is an extraordinary existence.</p><p></p><p>How did the Immortal Dao Companion manage to deceive the Sensory Barrier and enter the Seven-Colored Crystal Tower?</p><p></p><p>Han Jinlong and Jiang Wuxin suddenly recalled the anomaly that occurred when Luo Chengsheng entered the Sensory Barrier before.</p><p></p><p>Ah, so that's how it is.</p><p></p><p>Soon, Jiang Wuxin and Han Jinlong snapped out of their muddled thoughts. They had no time to ponder further about the Immortal Dao Companion, for they had a huge crisis awaiting them.</p><p></p><p>"Do you have anything to say?" Shen Luo asked the humans indifferently, a hint of coldness in his eyes.</p><p></p><p>This time, the humans have provoked the wrath of all tribes. It would be impossible to appease them. Even if they hand over the Crystal Hearts, it would not change the fate of their tribe's annihilation...</p><p></p><p>Zi Xuanrong and Xue Yueyu exchanged a glance, a subtle joy appearing in their eyes.</p><p></p><p>Excellent, their plan has succeeded beyond their expectations. The Human Tribe is doomed, and Jiang Wuxin and the Savage Heavens no longer need to worry about solving them.</p><p></p><p>The secret of the Eternal Longevity Body will now only be known to them.</p><p></p><p>Ao Xing, Bi Qiong, and the others stood silently, their gazes flickering.</p><p></p><p>They were quietly observing the unfolding of the situation.</p><p></p><p>"Lord Fengxing, the matter has already happened, it is irreversible. The Crystal Hearts... we cannot hand them over!" Han Jinlong transmitted his voice solemnly.</p><p></p><p>Jiang Wuxin narrowed his eyes and nodded slightly. The Gold Wheel King's thoughts were the same as his.</p><p></p><p>Even if they hand over the Crystal Hearts, it would not change the fate awaiting the Human Tribe... There's no need for that.</p><p></p><p>It's just that, the Immortal Dao Companion is really...</p><p></p><p>Han Jinlong and Jiang Wuxin had a somewhat numb expression, thinking about Luo Chengsheng trapped in the tower.</p><p></p><p>They felt a bit uneasy about it.</p><p></p><p>No wonder the Immortal Dao Companion had previously asked them what would happen if all the Crystal Hearts were seized...</p><p></p><p>Now they understood. It turns out that he had been planning this all along.</p><p></p><p>The Immortal Dao Companion's descent upon the Human Tribe with the Eternal Longevity Body was a great blessing, but soon after, he brought a great calamity upon them...</p><p></p><p>Jiang Wuxin and Han Jinlong did not respond to Shen Luo, but instead glanced at the towering pagoda before them, and simultaneously gritted their teeth, saying, "Return to the tribe!"</p><p></p><p>Thereafter, the humans quickly departed under the gloomy gazes of the other tribes. Due to the rules, no one hindered their departure.</p><p></p><p>However, the eyes of the surrounding tribes were flickering with anticipation.</p><p></p><p>They had already imagined the scene of the Human Tribe being suppressed by all the tribes.</p><p></p><p>Here is the full English translation of the Chinese excerpt:</p><p></p><p>The Scene.</p><p></p><p>The new 69 book bar 99 shu.com</p><p></p><p>It is equivalent to the human race being transformed into the "Seven-colored Crystal Tower", and all races will compete for the heart of the crystal again......</p><p></p><p>And this time, the human race will be the first to be destroyed.</p><p></p><p>Provoking the wrath of all, even the Heavenly Dao of the divine-demonic battlefield cannot protect them!</p><p></p><p>"What about that Lu Nan?"</p><p></p><p>Shen Luo suddenly asked.</p><p></p><p>After his question, everyone reacted with incredulity as they looked at the towering pagoda. That's right, the chief culprit of the human race hasn't come out of the tower, has he?</p><p></p><p>What's the situation?</p><p></p><p>"Divine Son, that Lu Nan, after suppressing our myriad races, has never appeared again, and should still be inside the tower at the moment," a member of the Heavenly God Clan reported with a bow.</p><p></p><p>Hearing this, Shen Luo's gaze turned icy as he looked at the Seven-colored Crystal Tower for a long time without speaking.</p><p></p><p>At this time, Bi Qiong laughed heartily: "It seems that Lu Nan also knows he has committed a great crime, and knows what the human race will face next, so he would rather hide in the Seven-colored Crystal Tower and wait for the next opening, and dare not come out."</p><p></p><p>Shen Luo glanced at Bi Qiong, and without further ado, he flashed away with the members of the Heavenly God Clan.</p><p></p><p>The occurrence of such an incident in the Seven-colored Crystal Tower, he must go back and report it to his father.</p><p></p><p>Next, Bi Qiong, Ao Xing, Feng Jun and the others also did not delay any further, and quickly led their respective tribes to leave.</p><p></p><p>Seeing the ten peak great clans leave one after another, the myriad races also left after taking a last look at the tightly closed Seven-colored Crystal Tower.</p><p></p><p>Of course, they also need to go back and prepare, prepare for the second round of competition for the heart of the crystal.</p><p></p><p>As for the location, it will be... the human race's territory!</p><p></p><p>Soon, with the departure of the myriad races, the area outside the Demon-Subduing Tower became completely quiet, with no one around.</p><p></p><p>Only the seven-story tower connecting heaven and earth shone with different lights, as if it had existed since ancient times.</p><p></p><p>.........</p><p></p><p>The Scorching Sun Celestial Wheel was speeding through the fog of war.</p><p></p><p>On it, the people of the human race stood, but their faces were all filled with solemnity, even... despair.</p><p></p><p>Han Jinlong sighed, "Wind Xing Venerable, when we go back, how do we explain to Sword Venerable and the others?"</p><p></p><p>Jiang Wuxin shook his head with a bitter smile, he didn't know either.</p><p></p><p>He suddenly looked at Fang Yin and the others and asked in a deep voice, "Fang Yin, how many crystal hearts did you collect in total this time?"</p><p></p><p>Fang Yin and Mo Lianqiu looked at each other, and then bowed carefully and replied, "Returning Wind Xing Venerable, the total number of crystal hearts is sixteen thousand six hundred and sixty-six..."</p><p></p><p>Sixteen thousand six hundred and sixty-six...</p><p></p><p>Hiss!</p><p></p><p>Even Han Jinlong and Jiang Wuxin couldn't help but take a deep breath in the face of such a terrifying number!</p><p></p><p>What does this represent?</p><p></p><p>As long as the human race is given some time, they can create more than ten thousand Mystic Immortal Realm experts!</p><p></p><p>Of course, the imagination is beautiful, but the reality is very bleak.</p><p></p><p>It takes dozens of years to refine a single crystal heart, how could the myriad races possibly give the human race that much time.</p><p></p><p>"Let's go back and discuss with Sword Venerable and the others, with so many crystal hearts, perhaps there is still a chance of turning the situation around."</p><p></p><p>Jiang Wuxin pondered.</p><p></p><p>"Mm." Han Jinlong responded.</p><p></p><p>At the moment, the only thing they can do is try their best to come up with a plan, otherwise they will only end up in disarray.</p><p></p><p>Of course, this is the greatest crisis the human race has ever faced,</p><p></p><p>but as the old saying goes, opportunity often coexists with crisis.</p><p></p><p>Looking on the bright side, this could also be an opportunity for the human race.</p><p></p><p>If they can turn danger into safety, the human race will definitely rise.</p><p></p><p>As Han Jinlong and Jiang Wuxin were pondering, the Scorching Sun Celestial Wheel they were riding was getting closer and closer to the human race's territory.</p>

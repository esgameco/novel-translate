        <h1>Chapter 283</h1>
        <div class="content">
            <p>Here is the full English translation of the Chinese excerpt:</p><p></p><p>Fu Tao stood anxiously outside the courtyard. üêçüòÇ‚ûÖ‚ûà≈ü–Ωùì§ùîµ.·ëïùï†–ºüçÆüçÅ</p><p></p><p>Ever since he escorted his elder sister back home yesterday, his whole person seemed to have been bewitched, and he still hadn't recovered until today.</p><p></p><p>He didn't know what exactly had happened, sigh.</p><p></p><p>Just then, Fu Tao saw Fu Shiyu coming out of the courtyard gate. Her complexion was still a bit pale, but much better than yesterday.</p><p></p><p>"Sister, you've finally recovered, you scared me to death."</p><p></p><p>Fu Tao hurried over and smiled bitterly.</p><p></p><p>"It's nothing, Xiao Tao, I made you and Father worry." Fu Shiyu shook her head.</p><p></p><p>"It's nothing." Fu Tao waved his hand, then frowned and asked, "Sister, you, you actually..."</p><p></p><p>He had wanted to ask since yesterday, but seeing Fu Shiyu's condition at the time, he had temporarily put it aside.</p><p></p><p>Hearing this, Fu Shiyu paused, then forced a smile and said, "It's nothing, I just got caught up in a whirlpool, maybe I overthought it."</p><p></p><p>Seeing that his sister was unwilling to say more, Fu Tao didn't press her, and smiled, "Sister, shall I take you to the city for a stroll?"</p><p></p><p>Fu Shiyu nodded, then suddenly remembered something and asked, "What about the Ouyang Clan?"</p><p></p><p>Hearing this, Fu Tao smiled and sighed, "After the Ouyang Patriarch was slain by that senior, the Ouyang, Xu, and Gao clans were also successively destroyed by our Fu Clan and the Liu Clan."</p><p></p><p>"From then on, Jingxun City was left with only our Fu Clan and the Liu Clan, the other small clans are nothing to be feared."</p><p></p><p>Towards the end, Fu Tao waved his hand proudly.</p><p></p><p>Hearing the words "that senior", Fu Shiyu's expression changed slightly again.</p><p></p><p>"Sister?" Fu Tao was suspicious.</p><p></p><p>"It's nothing, weren't you going to take me for a stroll in the city? Let's go."</p><p></p><p>Fu Shiyu shook her head, walking ahead with a heavy heart.</p><p></p><p>Fu Tao frowned and hurried to catch up.</p><p></p><p>He felt that his sister was just not right, but he couldn't quite put his finger on what was wrong.</p><p></p><p>.........</p><p></p><p>Blinking, ten years had passed,</p><p></p><p>With the passage of time, the shock of the destruction of the Ouyang and other clans gradually subsided.</p><p></p><p>As for the sword cultivator of the Divine Yang Realm who lived in the Fu Clan, although everyone was curious about him, he lived in seclusion, and apart from that day when he slew the Ouyang Patriarch, no one had seen him again.</p><p></p><p>In the streets and alleys of Jingxun City, there was all kinds of discussion:</p><p></p><p>"Huh, without realizing it, it seems the Heavenly Prodigy Competition is about to start again! I just calculated, it's only been ninety years."</p><p></p><p>"Oh yes, you're right, I almost forgot about that."</p><p></p><p>"Twenty thousand years, it really flies by in an instant..."</p><p></p><p>"Whew, a grandmaster who has lived for twenty thousand years, I worship him~I wasn't even born during the last Heavenly Prodigy Competition."</p><p></p><p>"Hehe, well said, for us cultivators, twenty thousand years is not really that long, time is a sharp blade that can tear apart everything in the world."</p><p></p><p>"Senior, was the last Heavenly Prodigy Competition fierce?"</p><p></p><p>"Haha, not just the last one, which Heavenly Prodigy Competition hasn't been extremely brutal? The Heavenly Prodigies in the Ancient Wasteland are all completely crazy when it comes to fighting for the top ten spots."</p><p></p><p>"Senior, does the Heavenly Prodigy Competition have age and cultivation level requirements? Otherwise, those ancient monsters would participate, and the Heavenly Prodigies wouldn't be able to withstand them."</p><p></p><p>"Correct, the age limit for each Heavenly Prodigy Competition is not exceeding ten million years old, and the cultivation level requirement is not lower than the Immortal Emperor Realm."</p><p></p><p>"Then it seems most of the Heavenly Prodigies are at the Immortal Emperor or Immortal Ancestor Realm, after all, the Immortal Emperor Realm has a lifespan of ten million years, and the Immortal Ancestor Realm has a lifespan of twenty million years."</p><p></p><p>"Haha, you're overthinking it. While there are indeed many Immortal Ancestor Realm cultivators in the Heavenly Prodigy Competition, Immortal Emperor Realm cultivators are actually very few, or even none at all."</p><p></p><p>Here is the full English translation of the Chinese excerpt:</p><p></p><p>"The threshold is not over 10 million years old, is it?" </p><p></p><p>"Although that's the case, if a person doesn't break through to the Immortal Ancestor realm within 10 million years, they wouldn't be qualified to be called a supreme cultivator! Who would still have the face to attend the Supreme Cultivator Assembly, what would they be trying to achieve? Trying to embarrass themselves?"</p><p></p><p>"Whew!"</p><p></p><p>"No need to be so shocked, at that Supreme Cultivator Assembly, there won't just be Immortal Ancestor realm cultivators under 10 million years old, there will even be Saint Origin realm and Saint Yang realm top-tier supreme cultivators!"</p><p></p><p>"Goodness, wouldn't that be on the same level as Elder Ouyang and Elder Liu?"</p><p></p><p>"Tch, Elder Ouyang is far behind those top-tier supreme cultivators. Those supreme cultivators are under 10 million years old, but when Elder Ouyang was at the Saint Yang realm, he was already several tens of millions of years old, how can they be compared?"</p><p></p><p>"Oh I see... Then, what about that person?"</p><p></p><p>"Which person?"</p><p></p><p>"That one!" The person said, glancing towards the direction of the Fu Clan.</p><p></p><p>"Cough cough, I don't know about that person... But the rumor is that their cultivation is at the late Saint Yang realm, they must also be several tens of millions of years old. Alright, alright, don't mention that big shot, you might end up inviting disaster upon yourself."</p><p></p><p>"Oh, then let's just wait for the Supreme Cultivator Assembly to begin. By the way, senior, where will the Supreme Cultivator Assembly be held?"</p><p></p><p>"I don't know, it seems the location of each Supreme Cultivator Assembly is different. When it's getting close to the assembly, the Ancient Desolate Sword Clan should release an announcement, it's probably soon."</p><p></p><p>...</p><p></p><p>Inside the Fu Clan.</p><p></p><p>The area of Lu Changsheng's guest room had long been designated as an absolute forbidden zone by Fu Liangcai. </p><p></p><p>No one was allowed to approach, not even the elders, not even Fu Shiyu and Fu Tao, nor even Lu Changsheng himself under normal circumstances.</p><p></p><p>Outside the guest room,</p><p></p><p>Li Shuyan stood there as usual, closing his eyes to cultivate when there was nothing to do, like an unmoving statue for ten years.</p><p></p><p>"Shuyan."</p><p></p><p>At this moment, Lu Changsheng's voice sounded from within the room. Li Shuyan was startled, and his eyes suddenly opened wide.</p><p></p><p>He quickly turned and pushed the door open, only to see Lu Changsheng sitting there leisurely drinking wine, with the bronze mask placed beside him.</p><p></p><p>He hurried over and bowed, "Sir, you called for Shuyan."</p><p></p><p>Lu Changsheng smiled and poured him a cup of wine in his dazed gaze, "Sit."</p><p></p><p>"Uh, yes, thank you sir." Li Shuyan was suddenly overwhelmed with gratitude.</p><p></p><p>"Saint Origin realm at the eighth layer, with your cultivation, you'll only be able to barely make it to the middle tier at that Supreme Cultivator Assembly..."</p><p></p><p>Lu Changsheng said lightly after taking a sip of wine.</p><p></p><p>Although he had mentally prepared for this, Li Shuyan still felt a shock, and a bitter smile even appeared at the corners of his mouth.</p><p></p><p>Thinking that he, a peak figure of the Ancestral Divine Realm, had come to this Eternal Heavenly Realm, and would only be able to rank in the middle tier among those supreme cultivators, it was truly embarrassing...</p><p></p><p>"Sir, it's Shuyan's inadequacy." Li Shuyan sighed, putting down the cup of wine he had just picked up, having lost the desire to drink for the moment.</p><p></p><p>"Isn't the reason you followed me to get stronger?" Lu Changsheng shook his head and smiled.</p><p></p><p>Li Shuyan pursed his lips, and with difficulty said, "Sir, for you to have brought Shuyan out of the Ancestral Divine Realm, to witness the boundless void and the Eternal Heavenly Realm, Shuyan is already deeply grateful. Shuyan dares not ask for anything else."</p><p></p><p>"Oh, that's a pity, I was going to help you get stronger. Since you don't aspire for it, then forget it." Lu Changsheng said regretfully.</p><p></p><p>Li Shuyan suddenly stood up, bending at a 90-degree angle!</p><p></p><p>"Sir! You've misunderstood Shuyan's meaning!"</p>

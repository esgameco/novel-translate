        <div class="content">
            <p>Here is the full English translation of the Chinese excerpt:</p><p></p><p>Upon hearing this,</p><p></p><p>Zuo Chou Shan's heart shuddered. moɔ.xuʜꙅ9</p><p></p><p>He lowered his eyelids and said indifferently, "The lord of this manor does not know what you are talking about."</p><p></p><p>Before Jiang Chu could continue, Kunlun Jue's eyes widened, as if he had recalled something, "Are you the lord of the Tiansha Manor in this Qingxuan Town?"</p><p></p><p>The Black Abyss Domain had a total of only twenty major cities and over a hundred towns, and since Qingxuan Town was relatively close to their Guanyou City, he did have some impression of the four major powers there.</p><p></p><p>Zuo Chou Shan did not answer, only standing guard.</p><p></p><p>He naturally knew that the person in front of him was the lord of the Tianxiang Palace in Guanyou City, but at the moment, all his attention was focused on the two elders of the Jiang clan, with no time to respond to Kunlun Jue.</p><p></p><p>Seeing this, a flash of displeasure appeared in Kunlun Jue's eyes, and he fell silent.</p><p></p><p>The Vice Palace Master glanced at the seven-colored giant snake and coldly said, "We came here to the Longevity Wine Hall to drink, so get out of the way!"</p><p></p><p>Zuo Chou Shan seemed not to have heard, and the seven-colored giant snake still stood there, its gaze bloodthirsty, ready to attack at any moment.</p><p></p><p>He was not stupid, not attacking immediately, as it would be best if the innkeeper came out.</p><p></p><p>These people in front of him... were not ones he could block. If he were to die here, he would be unwilling... he still had a deep grudge to avenge!</p><p></p><p>Hearing the news, more and more cultivators gathered towards the Longevity Wine Hall.</p><p></p><p>They saw the dozens of cultivators crushed to the ground, some even having lost their lives, and their hearts trembled.</p><p></p><p>What... had happened?</p><p></p><p>"Lord!"</p><p></p><p>At this moment, the people of the Tiansha Manor arrived, and when they saw Zuo Chou Shan's signature giant snake, they knew the situation was serious.</p><p></p><p>But Zuo Chou Shan's expression changed slightly, for he saw that Zuo Qi Ran had also come!</p><p></p><p>"Oh?"</p><p></p><p>Jiang Chu instantly sensed the abnormality of the bronze mirror, his gaze sharpening as he pulled it out with a flip of his hand!</p><p></p><p>Only to see the bronze mirror, which had previously been completely motionless, now flickering with a faint light!</p><p></p><p>Jiang Chong, Kunlun Jue, and the Vice Palace Master were shocked.</p><p></p><p>The next moment, a golden beam of light shot out from the bronze mirror, shining on Zuo Qi Ran in the crowd!</p><p></p><p>Everyone was puzzled!</p><p></p><p>"M-Miss, this is..." </p><p></p><p>The elders of the Tiansha Manor were at a loss, but subconsciously knew that this was definitely not a good thing!</p><p></p><p>Zuo Qi Ran stood there dumbfounded, a look of bewilderment on her face.</p><p></p><p>"Hahaha... So you've been hiding in this Qingxuan Town, truly a place where we've searched high and low..." </p><p></p><p>Jiang Chu regained his composure and laughed meaningfully.</p><p></p><p>He and Jiang Chong exchanged a glance, their hearts elated, for they had finally found them.</p><p></p><p>Jiang Chu suddenly looked at the stiff-faced Zuo Chou Shan and sneered, "Old master finally knows why you seemed familiar just now... Leng Heng Zhi, you've really made us search hard for you..."</p><p></p><p>Through the reaction of this bronze mirror, he instantly understood!</p><p></p><p>Zuo Chou Shan suddenly sighed and bared his teeth in a grim smile, "What Leng Heng Zhi? He's already dead, I am now the lord of the Tiansha Manor, Zuo Chou Shan!"</p><p></p><p>The crowd listened in a daze, only Zuo Qi Ran trembling inwardly, for she knew that the Jiang clan had come for them.</p><p></p><p>"Old master doesn't care if you are Leng Heng Zhi or this Zuo Chou Shan now, since we've found you father and daughter, we only need to kill you both to report back to the clan, how convenient for you to have survived for so many years." </p><p></p><p>As Jiang Chu spoke, he casually opened his left hand, and a blue glow gradually appeared in his palm.</p><p></p><p>As the blue glow emerged, the air temperature plummeted, and everyone felt as if they had been transported to the depths of winter, the dense killing intent seeming to sweep across the entire scene.</p><p></p><p>"Father!" </p><p></p><p>Seeing this, Zuo Qi Ran's heart was greatly alarmed, and she hurriedly tried to rush to Zuo Chou Shan's side.</p><p></p><p>"Qi Ran, don't come over!" Zuo Chou Shan shouted.</p><p></p><p>Zuo Qi Ran's expression changed slightly, but she still disregarded it and came to his side.</p><p></p><p>The elders of the Tiansha Manor saw this and, despite their hesitation, gritted their teeth and came to stand behind Zuo Chou Shan, lining up. At a time like this, they could not retreat.</p><p></p><p>Even though they knew the few people in front of them were super powerful...</p><p></p><p>Here is the full English translation of the Chinese excerpt:</p><p></p><p>It was actually Left Youshun who stood rooted to the spot, as if he had been petrified. Trembling, he retreated into the crowd amidst some disdainful gazes, disappearing from sight.</p><p></p><p>In the sea of people, Su Qianghe and others who had rushed over upon hearing the news looked at the scene with doubt and bewilderment. </p><p></p><p>They recognized Kunlun Yu and the Vice Abbot of the Tianxiang Palace, but did not know who the two old men were, nor did they understand why these powerful figures had grievances with Left Youshun!</p><p></p><p>Leaving aside the two obvious leaders, even Kunlun Yu, the Abbot of the Tianxiang Palace, was a super powerful expert at the Immortal Emperor Realm!</p><p></p><p>Even if they wanted to help, they were powerless to do so.</p><p></p><p>They had some connections with Left Youshun, but not to the point of risking their lives for him!</p><p></p><p>"Hehe, fellow Daoists, causing a ruckus outside the Longevity Wine Hall and even killing quite a few customers in the queue, isn't that a bit too much?" </p><p></p><p>Just then, Peng Fang emerged amidst numerous astonished gazes, walking up to stand in front of Left Youshun, facing Jiang Chu and the others.</p><p></p><p>Left Youshun paused, wasn't this the fat guy who had ruined his plans that day? What was going on?</p><p></p><p>The people present were also dumbfounded, increasingly puzzled, not knowing what kind of extraordinary person this fat guy was.</p><p></p><p>Many recognized this fat guy, who often loitered outside the Longevity Wine Hall. </p><p></p><p>Today's commotion was truly a tangled web, and they were completely at a loss.</p><p></p><p>Jiang Chu's brows furrowed as he scrutinized the unfamiliar fat man, his gaze soon turning grave!</p><p></p><p>This fat guy was actually an Immortal Emperor Realm expert!</p><p></p><p>The Black Abyss Domain was indeed a hidden tiger's den, this small Qingxuan Town actually had such a powerful expert.</p><p></p><p>"Old man advises the fellow Daoists not to meddle in matters that don't concern you. Even if you are an Immortal Emperor, there are some things you should not interfere with, lest you... lose your life."</p><p></p><p>Jiang Chu said indifferently with narrowed eyes.</p><p></p><p>As soon as these words fell, the entire venue erupted in an uproar!</p><p></p><p>Countless astonished gazes were cast towards Peng Fang!</p><p></p><p>This usually cheerful fat guy was actually an Immortal Emperor Realm expert?!</p><p></p><p>And this old man's words were so nonchalant, could he also be an Immortal Emperor Realm expert?</p><p></p><p>Immortal Emperor Realm experts were extremely rare in the past, but today, two of them had suddenly appeared?</p><p></p><p>Left Youshun looked at Peng Fang's back, his face somewhat pale. No wonder that day, this fat guy had looked at him with such disdain... now it made sense.</p><p></p><p>Peng Fang smiled, "Not interfere? Just with the two of you at the Second Realm of the Immortal Emperor and him at the First Realm?"</p><p></p><p>The Vice Abbot's face was awkward, as this fat guy had completely disregarded him, this was a blatant display of contempt.</p><p></p><p>Three Immortal Emperors, plus this fat guy, four Immortal Emperors! The crowd was completely dumbfounded!</p><p></p><p>Jiang Chu and the others' gazes sharpened further, through these words, they realized this fat guy's cultivation was likely far surpassing theirs!</p><p></p><p>But he was not at all intimidated, the power behind him filled him with confidence!</p><p></p><p>So Jiang Chu said indifferently, "Fellow Daoist, your cultivation is profound. If you do not meddle in this matter today, the Jiang Clan Imperial Family would be willing to befriend you..."</p><p></p><p>The Jiang Clan Imperial Family!</p><p></p><p>These words immediately stirred up a tumultuous uproar, like a massive tidal wave crashing onto a calm sea, leaving the crowd utterly shaken!</p><p></p><p>Today's events had actually involved such a powerful force, the legendary Imperial Family had appeared...</p><p></p><p>Even the usually composed Peng Fang's pupils shrank sharply!</p><p></p><p>His gaze wavered with indecision.</p><p></p><p>At this moment,</p><p></p><p>Tap, tap, tap... unhurried footsteps suddenly sounded.</p><p></p><p>A figure in blue robes emerged from the courtyard, with Tongxin and Lin Dong following cautiously behind.</p><p></p><p>"Manager... ..."</p><p></p><p>The crowd was startled.</p><p></p><p>Lu Changsheng's gaze swept over the corpses on the ground, then looked at Jiang Chu and the others.</p><p></p><p>"On my turf, if you kill my customers, even if you are Immortal Emperors, you must pay for it with your lives."</p><p></p><p>As these words fell, the crowd was stunned, then filled with empathy, their hearts warming.</p><p></p><p>In this Black Abyss Domain, human sentiment had always been cold, but they had never been so boldly protected by anyone before.</p><p></p><p>The manager really cares about his customers.</p>

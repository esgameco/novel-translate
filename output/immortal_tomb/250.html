        <h1>Chapter 250</h1>
        <div class="content">
            <p>Here is the full English translation of the Chinese excerpt:</p><p></p><p>At the lonely grave, Mirror gazed at the tombstone with a gentle expression. </p><p></p><p>Unnoticed, the sun had set and night had fallen.</p><p></p><p>He dug open the grave and lay down inside, with the dry bones by his side.</p><p></p><p>In the darkness, Mirror gently caressed the dry bones, then took out a short blade from his bosom.</p><p></p><p>The next moment, he stabbed himself fiercely in the chest, stirring the blade back and forth without expression, until the heart and the relic within it were completely shattered!</p><p></p><p>Blood flowed from the corners of Mirror's mouth. He turned his head to look at the dry bones, as if muttering to himself: "Xiao Rou, the other day I met an extraordinary person who truly redeemed me."</p><p></p><p>"Yes, how laughable. I've always been thinking about how to repay you, to make amends for you. But I could never understand that your love for Shu Yan, and Shu Yan's guilt towards you, can never be repaid or made up for."</p><p></p><p>"Since I can never fully repay it, then let's just leave it be, shall we?"</p><p></p><p>At this moment, Mirror was immersed in an indescribable emotion, his words warm and heartfelt.</p><p></p><p>"Now, I only wish...to stay by your side forever in this lonely grave. You are all alone here...truly so lonely."</p><p></p><p>Mirror smiled faintly, turning to carefully embrace the dry bones.</p><p></p><p>The relic in his chest glowed like fireflies, then dissipated...</p><p></p><p>His eyes gradually grew heavy.</p><p></p><p>Finally, Mirror lost consciousness.</p><p></p><p>In his last moment, his final, powerless and resigned whisper echoed in the grave:</p><p></p><p>"Layman Lu, you were right. My Buddha, I no longer need to cultivate..."</p><p></p><p>"The supreme Buddha-body, I...no longer desire it."</p><p></p><p>...</p><p></p><p>In the city of Mingxin, Lu Changsheng's steps suddenly paused, a faint smile appearing in his eyes.</p><p></p><p>The little Tong, who was following behind carrying a medicine box, nearly bumped into him, looking up at the tall figure in front of her with a puzzled gaze.</p><p></p><p>"Come, I'll take you to a place to treat the illness," Lu Changsheng said, then resumed his steps.</p><p></p><p>"Yes, Master," Little Tong hurriedly followed, her palms sweating nervously. After all, she had only handled a few real cases so far.</p><p></p><p>The most important thing was that in Yanwu Town, Grandpa, Grandma, and Aunt had been quite caring and trusting of her, so she felt much less pressure.</p><p></p><p>But in this unfamiliar city, she was afraid of making mistakes.</p><p></p><p>Being scolded by the Master was one thing, but if a patient suffered due to her diagnosis, that would be another matter entirely.</p><p></p><p>Lu Changsheng sensed Little Tong's unease and said calmly, "Don't be nervous. Just diagnose confidently when the time comes. I'll be here watching, so there won't be any problems."</p><p></p><p>These words seemed to have a magical effect, and Little Tong's heart immediately settled. She bowed and replied, "Yes, Master."</p><p></p><p>...</p><p></p><p>Soon, Lu Changsheng led Little Tong to the slums of Mingxin City.</p><p></p><p>Little Tong was stunned, staring blankly at the dilapidated buildings, the emaciated elderly and women passing by, and the thin, dark-skinned children playing with stones in the corners.</p><p></p><p>This scene was so similar to what she had seen in Yanwu Town before.</p><p></p><p>The only difference was that she seemed much luckier than all the children here.</p><p></p><p>"You, in fact, are quite unfortunate," Lu Changsheng suddenly said, turning his head to look at her.</p><p></p><p>Little Tong emerged from her empathetic state, gazing at her Master with a puzzled expression.</p><p></p><p>Huh? She was unfortunate? </p><p></p><p>She felt very lucky - the people in the town had been so good to her, and then she came to work as the Master's medicine boy, gaining the Master's favor, learning to speak, and studying medical books.</p><p></p><p>How was this not fortunate?</p><p></p><p>"For countless lifetimes, I don't know which lifetime you are in now, but I know that in all your lifetimes, there has not been a single one without suffering."</p><p></p><p>Here is the full English translation of the Chinese excerpt:</p><p></p><p>The Tribulation.</p><p></p><p>Lu Changsheng smiled and said a sentence.</p><p></p><p>Hearing this, Xiao Tong was confused, she really didn't understand at all.</p><p></p><p>But in the next moment, a strange blue light flashed in the depths of her pupils.</p><p></p><p>Xiao Tong raised her head, staring rigidly at the figure in green, her eyes shining with incomparable brightness, whispering in surprise: "Brother..."</p><p></p><p>Lu Changsheng paused, turned around and looked down at her, frowning slightly, then pointed a finger at her forehead.</p><p></p><p>The brightness in Xiao Tong's eyes immediately dimmed, becoming hazy, and a trace of fresh blood flowed from the corner of her mouth.</p><p></p><p>...</p><p></p><p>At the same time.</p><p></p><p>In the Divine Celestial Realm, in the Divine Emperor's Palace.</p><p></p><p>Xing Tian's heart suddenly twitched, his whole body shuddering!</p><p></p><p>His face changed drastically, and he disappeared in the first instant, heading towards a certain direction.</p><p></p><p>Soon.</p><p></p><p>Xing Tian appeared in a luxurious bedroom, he walked quickly to the ice bed in the center, emitting white mist, and frowned as he looked at the beautiful woman in phoenix robes.</p><p></p><p>Sure enough, he saw the woman frowning in pain, with blood flowing from the corner of her mouth.</p><p></p><p>"Tong'er! Tong'er!" </p><p></p><p>Xing Tian exclaimed anxiously, stomping his feet.</p><p></p><p>But he could only stare.</p><p></p><p>Xing Tian knew that in this situation, Tong'er must have encountered some mishap in the Tribulation of the Myriad Worlds.</p><p></p><p>Fortunately, He Xitong's abnormality soon subsided, and her brow relaxed.</p><p></p><p>Xing Tian paused, heaving a big sigh of relief, then a handkerchief appeared in his hand, and he quickly wiped the fresh blood from the corner of her mouth.</p><p></p><p>"Ah... Tong'er, what suffering have you endured, why... would there be such a torturous thing as the Tribulation of the Myriad Worlds! Father wishes he could take your place and go through this Tribulation for you."</p><p></p><p>Xing Tian sighed, his expression full of tenderness.</p><p></p><p>Soon, his heart was filled with anger again. Who hurt Tong'er! </p><p></p><p>He had heard from Senior Lu that the Tribulation of the Myriad Worlds was a real and occurring event, </p><p></p><p>the one who hurt Tong'er, better not be found by him, hmph!</p><p></p><p>After a moment, Xing Tian looked at the unconscious He Xitong on the ice bed, sighed deeply and left.</p><p></p><p>...</p><p></p><p>"You're awake."</p><p></p><p>In Ming Heart City, after Xiao Tong regained consciousness, she opened her eyes in a daze and saw the teacher standing with his hands behind his back beside her.</p><p></p><p>She was startled, quickly straightened the crooked apprentice hat on her head, got up from the stool, and bowed in confusion: "Teacher... what is this place..."</p><p></p><p>She had actually fainted!</p><p></p><p>Lu Changsheng waved his hand, and a bench appeared. He also sat down and smiled: "You've been overworking on your medical studies lately."</p><p></p><p>I see.</p><p></p><p>Xiao Tong secretly let out a sigh of relief, then carefully and awkwardly said, "Teacher, Xiao Tong has taken up your time."</p><p></p><p>"No problem." Lu Changsheng waved his hand, "You've only been unconscious for a while. Do you want to rest a bit before continuing?"</p><p></p><p>"No, no need, Xiao Tong can do it!" Xiao Tong said hurriedly.</p><p></p><p>She naturally didn't dare to rest, and she felt that her condition was good now, even if it wasn't, she had to make it work.</p><p></p><p>Lu Changsheng nodded slightly, then waved his hand, and a table and a pole appeared in front of him, with a vertical scroll hanging on it.</p><p></p><p>'The Divine Physician is Here, Free Medical Treatment' was written in the style of a dragon flying and a phoenix dancing, strongly impacting Xiao Tong's eyes.</p><p></p><p>Soon, she was sweating profusely, completely panicked!</p><p></p><p>Lu Changsheng looked at her strangely and said, "The divine physician on that refers to me, why are you so panicked?"</p><p></p><p>"Oh..." Xiao Tong let out a sigh of relief, but felt embarrassed inside, lowering her head and clutching her clothes, not daring to speak.</p><p></p><p>Soon, Lu Changsheng's attention attracted the notice of many poor, weak women and children in the slum, and they curiously approached.</p><p></p><p>Lu Changsheng took a sip of wine from the gourd at his waist and said indifferently, "It's about to begin."</p><p></p><p>"Ah, yes, teacher!" </p><p></p><p>Hearing this, Xiao Tong quickly took down her medicine box, stood on tiptoe to place it on the table in front of her, and then nervously looked at the crowd approaching.</p>

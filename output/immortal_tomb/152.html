        <h1>Chapter 152</h1>
        <div class="content">
            <p>Here is the full English translation of the Chinese excerpt:</p><p></p><p>"It is rumored that the Lord of the Heavenly Snake Manor is a Venerable of the Fifth Rank. If that's the case, then the Innkeeper of the Longevity Inn must at least be a Venerable of the Fifth Rank, or even possibly a Venerable of the Sixth Rank?"</p><p></p><p>"That's possible. Tsk tsk, our Qingxuan Town has another big shot now... Once the top powers learn of this, our Qingxuan Town will become even more lively and exciting!"</p><p></p><p>"Ah, that's secondary. Do you know, the wine at the Longevity Inn is truly a peerless vintage! During the day when they're open for business, anyone who patronizes the inn can drink a free cup. I had some today, and I can guarantee you, it's the best wine I've ever had in my life! The flavor is just..."</p><p></p><p>"Really? Is that true?"</p><p></p><p>"Why would I lie to you? I'm telling you this in good faith. If you don't believe me, go take a look outside the Longevity Inn right now. There's already a long queue! Everyone is there to be the first to drink that soul-cleansing vintage when the inn opens tomorrow morning!"</p><p></p><p>"Wow, is it really that crazy?... Alright, let's go take a look."</p><p></p><p>"..."</p><p></p><p>Such discussions were rampant throughout Qingxuan Town, and many shops and even brothels were casting envious glances towards the Longevity Inn.</p><p></p><p>Good, their businesses had hardly any customers tonight, as everyone had gone to queue up at the Longevity Inn, even though it was still closed! Damn it!</p><p></p><p>When did cheap wine become more alluring than beautiful women?</p><p></p><p>Given the Innkeeper's apparent power, it's forgivable for today. But if this continues, will they even be able to keep their businesses running?</p><p></p><p>If it persists, they'll have to use their connections to approach the top powers in the town and exert pressure on the Longevity Inn!</p><p></p><p>Hmph!</p><p></p><p>At this moment, there was indeed a long queue stretching out in front of the Longevity Inn, as far as the eye could see.</p><p></p><p>Everyone was relatively quiet, afraid of disturbing the Innkeeper and incurring his wrath.</p><p></p><p>However, the whispered conversations were extremely dense in the air.</p><p></p><p>"Fellow Daoist, your position here is quite close to the front. What's the price for me to buy your spot?"</p><p></p><p>"Scram, I'm not selling!"</p><p></p><p>"You want to die?!"</p><p></p><p>"Hmph, if you dare try anything on the Innkeeper's turf, you'll find that his rules are his rules."</p><p></p><p>"You... Forget it, I'll remember you!"</p><p></p><p>"Spit, who's afraid of whom? Don't worry, even if you don't come after me, I'll hunt you down and kill you! Those who aren't afraid to die can stay in Qingxuan Town!"</p><p></p><p>"You..."</p><p></p><p>Due to this, the wandering cultivators, though disgruntled, didn't dare to cause trouble. They were ruthless people who had tasted the blade, but that didn't mean they weren't afraid of death or lacked common sense.</p><p></p><p>They could only queue up and wait for that drink.</p><p></p><p>For the sake of that soul-cleansing vintage, they had even forgone visiting the brothels tonight.</p><p></p><p>Truly, after hearing others describe the wine as extraordinarily divine, saying it would make one have no regrets even in death, who wouldn't be tempted?</p><p></p><p>Inside the inn, Lu Changsheng heard the commotion outside and smiled slightly. Having drunk countless wines over the years, he naturally understood the sentiments of these wine enthusiasts.</p><p></p><p>In his inn, there were not only the soul-cleansing vintage, but also other exquisite wines, all of his own unique recipes.</p><p></p><p>Those wine recipes were concocted by him over countless years, blending the insights from myriad wines. How could they not be delicious?</p><p></p><p>Of course, for him, they were just ordinary. Perhaps... not even as good as that cup of Peach Blossom Vintage from back in the Moyu Town days...</p><p></p><p>...</p><p></p><p>At the Heavenly Snake Manor.</p><p></p><p>"Lord, a new inn has opened in the town, and it's incredibly popular. Even when it's closed, the wandering cultivators are queuing up, all saying the wine is delicious. How good could it be? We've had the best wines."</p><p></p><p>"Yes, and I've also heard the Innkeeper is unfathomable in his abilities..."</p><p></p><p>Here is the full English translation of the Chinese excerpt:</p><p></p><p>"It's highly possible that he is a powerful cultivator at the Immortal Venerable realm. I wonder what his purpose is in coming to our Qingxuan Town?" </p><p></p><p>In the main hall, Zuo Qoushan listened quietly to the reports and discussions of the elders, not saying a word. </p><p></p><p>In his hand, he was toying with a multicolored venomous snake.</p><p></p><p>Suddenly, his gaze flashed, and with a press of his palm, the hall fell silent. He said, "Summon the young master and young miss."</p><p></p><p>"Yes." An elder responded, then vanished.</p><p></p><p>Moments later, Zuo Qizhan and a young man with sword-like brows and bright eyes quickly entered the hall. </p><p></p><p>Zuo Qizhan gave the young man a cold look, while the young man smiled back at her.</p><p></p><p>They approached the lower area and bowed, saying, "Greetings, Lord Patriarch."</p><p></p><p>"Hehe." Zuo Qoushan looked at the young man and nodded with a smile, saying, "Youer, you go stand aside first. I have something to ask your sister."</p><p></p><p>"Yes." Left Youer bowed and retreated to the side.</p><p></p><p>At this, Zuo Qizhan's gaze flashed, and her heart grew increasingly cold.</p><p></p><p>Zuo Qoushan then looked at Zuo Qizhan and said indifferently, "Qizhan, did you go to the Longevity Wine House today?"</p><p></p><p>The hall fell silent.</p><p></p><p>Zuo Qizhan's heart trembled slightly, immediately realizing that it was her personal maid who had told the Patriarch. Her gaze turned icy, and a murderous intent finally emerged in her heart... 'Looking for death!'</p><p></p><p>She bowed and said, "Yes, Patriarch, I did go to the Longevity Wine House today."</p><p></p><p>Zuo Qoushan asked, "Since you went there, then tell me about it."</p><p></p><p>Zuo Qizhan fell silent. She had been so focused on savoring the delicious Xihun Liquor that she didn't know anything else...</p><p></p><p>She then replied, "The innkeeper's strength is unfathomable. His mere aura suppressed thousands of people present. And... the Xihun Liquor is really delicious."</p><p></p><p>Hearing this, the crowd's expressions became somewhat grave, but when they heard the last sentence, they paused.</p><p></p><p>The Xihun Liquor is really delicious? What's this all about?</p><p></p><p>Is this the kind of thing the young miss of the Tianshe Manor should be saying? And in front of the Patriarch and many high-ranking officials?</p><p></p><p>Could the Xihun Liquor really be that good?</p><p></p><p>The crowd couldn't help but become curious.</p><p></p><p>Zuo Qoushan, however, automatically filtered out the last sentence and continued to ask, "Do you know what his purpose is?"</p><p></p><p>"I don't know." Zuo Qizhan shook her head.</p><p></p><p>Seeing this, Zuo Qoushan opened his mouth, wanting to scold them a bit, but in the end, he just snorted coldly and slowly stood up, saying, "An ordinary wine house, but the innkeeper seems to be an Immortal Venerable? Hehe, as the Patriarch of this manor, I want to see what undisclosed purpose he has in coming to this Qingxuan Town."</p><p></p><p>"I'm sure the other three top forces in Qingxuan Town are also preparing to take action. If he wants to carve out a place for himself here, he must have the strength to make us take notice. Otherwise... he'd better just leave. What does it matter if he's an Immortal Venerable? After all, I'm a Sixth-Rank Immortal Venerable now! Even if he's an Immortal Venerable, how could he be stronger than me? I can easily crush thousands with just my aura alone."</p><p></p><p>The crowd bowed and said, "The Patriarch's words are absolutely right!"</p><p></p><p>However, Zuo Qizhan's gaze flashed, and she recalled the young man in green's deep gaze from earlier. She felt that he was more than just an Immortal Venerable...</p><p></p><p>And there was also the fact that she guessed that when the Patriarch and the others drank the Xihun Liquor, they would have to bow down to that innkeeper.</p><p></p><p>"You all may go and rest. Tomorrow morning, Youer and Qizhan, you will accompany me to the Longevity Wine House."</p><p></p><p>Zuo Qoushan waved his hand and said.</p><p></p><p>"Yes, we shall take our leave."</p><p></p><p>The elders actually wanted to go too, but seeing that the Patriarch didn't intend to bring them, they could only give up, or perhaps... sneak off on their own time.</p><p></p><p>Regardless, they had to try that Xihun Liquor that was spoken of so highly, right?</p><p></p><p>After the crowd left, Zuo Qoushan's gaze flickered in the darkness as he gently stroked the snake's head, murmuring, "An Immortal Venerable? If I can recruit him to my Tianshe Manor, then the overall strength of my Tianshe Manor will undoubtedly rise to the top in this Qingxuan Town."</p>

        <h1>Chapter 141</h1>
        <div class="content">
            <p>Here is the full English translation of the Chinese excerpt:</p><p></p><p>L√º Changsheng slowly lifted his foot and stepped out of the Divine Path. üíö‚ô¢‚ùª‚ùæùêí·ïºùêîùîÅ.ùêÇùïÜÔΩçüò≤üíû</p><p></p><p>The crowd behind him followed closely, their eyes fixed on the three figures in the air, as if facing a formidable enemy!</p><p></p><p>Even the old turtle had a grave expression, staring intently at the middle-aged man, from whom he had not gained any benefits before.</p><p></p><p>Except for the observant L√º Changsheng, the others were too preoccupied to appreciate the grand scenery of the Ancestral Heavenly Divine Realm.</p><p></p><p>The three approaching figures were also regarded as formidable enemies.</p><p></p><p>The middle-aged man stared at L√º Changsheng and said in a deep voice, "Recently, a powerful fist strike came from the Four Directions Immortal Realm, crashing into our Divine King's Hall. Could the owner of that fist strike be you, sir?"</p><p></p><p>What?</p><p></p><p>The crowd was puzzled.</p><p></p><p>But Shi Wushi and Gu Yinyang immediately recalled the punch they had witnessed at the border of the Southern Immortal Realm that day!</p><p></p><p>They looked at L√º Changsheng with pounding hearts. Could it be...</p><p></p><p>Their breathing became more rapid, and Chu Lingian and the others, sensing their unease, communicated with them through voice transmission.</p><p></p><p>Shi Wushi then recounted the events of that day, leaving Chu Lingian and the others dumbfounded.</p><p></p><p>So, the Longevity Immortal Emperor had punched his way from the Four Directions Immortal Realm to the Ancestral Heavenly Divine Realm?</p><p></p><p>This...</p><p></p><p>L√º Changsheng replied calmly, "And then, what do you have to say?"</p><p></p><p>The middle-aged man's expression turned grim, and he gritted his teeth, "Sir, we belong to the Divine King's Hall and have been ordered to guard the Divine Path..."</p><p></p><p>L√º Changsheng chuckled, "I don't care who you are or how powerful your faction is. I just want to know what you plan to do today."</p><p></p><p>The middle-aged man took a deep breath, clenched his fist, and a violent aura of divine energy surged forth.</p><p></p><p>Seeing this, L√º Changsheng simply pointed a finger, as he had done before, without any visible movement.</p><p></p><p>The middle-aged man's expression relaxed, and he frowned, about to say something, when the three figures suddenly froze. Three bloody holes had appeared on their foreheads, and blood was gushing down, filling their nostrils and corners of their mouths with a bloody stench.</p><p></p><p>"You..."</p><p></p><p>Their eyes widened in terror, and their consciousness rapidly faded until it dissipated. They tilted their heads back and plummeted from the sky.</p><p></p><p>L√º Changsheng turned around and smiled at Chu Lingian and the others, "It's done."</p><p></p><p>Gulp...</p><p></p><p>Chu Lingian and the others swallowed hard, unsure of what to say.</p><p></p><p>Xue Ta and the Snow Ball Clan Leader were also dumbfounded, as if in a dream.</p><p></p><p>This Divine Path, it was as if they had never come.</p><p></p><p>"You all, especially you, Yinyang, don't have much lifespan left. Now that you've arrived in the Ancestral Heavenly Divine Realm, your lifespan will stabilize for the time being. As long as you diligently cultivate and advance, your lifespan will increase significantly," L√º Changsheng said softly.</p><p></p><p>Chu Lingian and the others regained their composure, and their hearts were filled with gratitude for L√º Changsheng's words and actions. They suddenly knelt down, bowing deeply.</p><p></p><p>"We... are deeply grateful to the Longevity Immortal Emperor. We have relied on you throughout this journey."</p><p></p><p>As Immortal Emperors themselves, this was the first time they had knelt before L√º Changsheng. They understood that without him, their ultimate fate would have been death.</p><p></p><p>Through these series of events, L√º Changsheng's identity and strength had proven to be unfathomable, and they now held him in even greater reverence, no longer daring to view him as just another Immortal Emperor.</p><p></p><p>Xue Ta and the Snow Ball Clan Leader also deeply bowed.</p><p></p><p>L√º Changsheng graciously accepted their gesture and smiled, "You may go now, and quickly report for your assignments."</p><p></p><p>"As you command."</p><p></p><p>The four of them rose, their attitude towards L√º Changsheng having undergone a complete transformation. Where there was once a sense of awe, now there was only reverence.</p><p></p><p>At this moment, Xue Ta also bid farewell to the Snow Ball Clan Leader, whispering, "Leader, are you really going back?"</p><p></p><p>"Haha, yes, you should go quickly..."</p><p></p><p>Here is the full English translation of the Chinese excerpt:</p><p></p><p>"Go to the ancestors," the Snow Ball Tribe Chief smiled and then looked at Lu Changsheng, Chu Lingtian, and the others, and finally said, "Xue Ta, in the Ancestral Heavenly God Realm, remember to mingle with the fellow Dao companions."</p><p></p><p>Xue Ta's eyes flashed as she nodded and said, "Chief, don't worry, Xue Ta understands."</p><p></p><p>Seeing this, Lu Changsheng slightly nodded his head, and he walked back towards the Divine Path, smiling and saying, "Then I shall return to the Four Directions Immortal Realm. When I have the chance, I will visit the Ancestral Heavenly God Realm. We shall meet again."</p><p></p><p>The Snow Ball Tribe Chief hurriedly followed after Lu Changsheng, knowing that following Lu Changsheng down the Divine Path would be incredibly easy, whereas it would take him an unknown amount of time to do it himself.</p><p></p><p>"Master!"</p><p></p><p>At this moment, the unmoving old turtle called out.</p><p></p><p>Lu Changsheng's body paused, and he turned his head.</p><p></p><p>"Master, the old turtle will stay in the Ancestral Heavenly God Realm to help them," the old turtle said, bowing.</p><p></p><p>Hearing this, Chu Lingtian and the others were slightly taken aback, but then felt a sense of gratitude.</p><p></p><p>This old turtle fellow is really not bad, not wasting those thousands of years of friendship.</p><p></p><p>"Old turtle, we should be able to manage, you should still follow Immortal Emperor Changsheng..."</p><p></p><p>Before Chu Lingtian could finish speaking,</p><p></p><p>Lu Changsheng just smiled and said, "No, since he wants to stay and help you all, then let him stay. It's better this way."</p><p></p><p>With that, he and the Snow Ball Tribe Chief entered the Divine Path and disappeared.</p><p></p><p>To be honest, with the talkative old turtle gone, Lu Changsheng felt more at ease.</p><p></p><p>The only downside is that he would have to personally handle some minor matters, but it's not a big problem.</p><p></p><p>At worst, he'll just find a henchman later, hmm, one that talks less.</p><p></p><p>The old turtle: "......"</p><p></p><p>"Cough, old turtle, perhaps Immortal Emperor Changsheng had some urgent matters to attend to, let's go," Chu Lingtian coughed and came over to pat the old turtle's shoulder, comforting him.</p><p></p><p>"Lingtian, you don't need to comfort me, I know the master finds me annoying," the old turtle said, waving his hand and sighing in a pretend melancholy manner.</p><p></p><p>In fact, his mood was quite good at the moment. Leaving Lu Changsheng, he could now enjoy a carefree period for a while. The young ladies in the Ancestral Heavenly God Realm, he wondered what they would be like, hehe.</p><p></p><p>Soon, the old turtle and the others left with Xue Ta.</p><p></p><p>Not long after they left, several figures suddenly appeared in the area.</p><p></p><p>Their gaze lingered on the Divine Path entrance for a moment, then they searched, finally focusing on the three middle-aged people on the other side.</p><p></p><p>Only to see that they had three bloody holes on their foreheads, and the three middle-aged people had already lost their lives.</p><p></p><p>"We're too late..."</p><p></p><p>"It seems those fellows from the Five Great Immortal Realms have already arrived in the Ancestral Heavenly God Realm..."</p><p></p><p>"You two continue to guard the Divine Path, I'll go back to the Divine King's Palace."</p><p></p><p>"Yes."</p><p></p><p>...</p><p></p><p>The Four Directions Immortal Realm.</p><p></p><p>Lu Changsheng led the Snow Ball Tribe Chief through the Divine Path, arriving unhindered outside the broken gate.</p><p></p><p>"It might take you a long time to return on your own, let me take you back."</p><p></p><p>Lu Changsheng said, lightly waving his sleeve.</p><p></p><p>In the next moment, he and the Snow Ball Tribe Chief disappeared from the Divine Path.</p><p></p><p>As they disappeared, the Divine Path gate began to mysteriously and gradually repair itself.</p><p></p><p>Faintly, a weary sigh could be heard.</p><p></p><p>"Ah."</p><p></p><p>...</p><p></p><p>Snow Ball Tribe's territory, the peak of the Snow Mountain.</p><p></p><p>The bitter wind was biting.</p><p></p><p>"I sincerely thank the great one for helping our Xue Ta go to the Ancestral Heavenly God Realm. I hope the great one will come visit our Snow Ball Tribe in the future."</p><p></p><p>The Snow Ball Tribe Chief expressed his gratitude sincerely. He no longer dared to address the powerful blue-robed man as a fellow Dao companion.</p><p></p><p>"It's nothing, it's just mutual assistance and benefit."</p><p></p><p>Lu Changsheng smiled, then prepared to leave alone.</p><p></p><p>"May I ask the great one's name?" the Snow Ball Tribe Chief suddenly called out, his eyes filled with anticipation.</p><p></p><p>"Lu Changsheng."</p><p></p><p>The smile echoed in the biting cold wind, and the blue-robed figure gradually faded into the heavy snowstorm.</p>

        <h1>Chapter 509</h1>
        <div class="content">
            <p>Here is the full English translation of the Chinese novel excerpt:</p><p></p><p>[Undefeated Celestial Venerable]</p><p></p><p>...</p><p></p><p>After Luchang Sheng returned to the Divine Emperor's Palace and placed Heixitong in the Demon-Subduing Tower, he left the Ancestral Heavenly Realm together with her.</p><p></p><p>Luchang Sheng's thoughts turned, originally intending to go directly to the Soul Realm, but after some consideration, he first went to the Qiankun Heaven, using his Dao Thoughts to cover his tracks, and took a secret look at the people of the Carefree Sect, seeing that they were all doing well, before turning and going to the Soul Realm.</p><p></p><p>Soul Realm.</p><p></p><p>After Luchang Sheng arrived here,</p><p></p><p>he discovered that the Reincarnation Demon Child had caused quite a commotion in the Soul Realm, with the Thirty-Six Evils and Seventy-Two Calamities being completely unable to handle him.</p><p></p><p>"Ahem."</p><p></p><p>Luchang Sheng lightly cleared his throat.</p><p></p><p>The Reincarnation Demon Child was immediately startled, and then the various high-ranking figures of the Soul Realm hurriedly went to pay their respects.</p><p></p><p>"We pay our respects to the Dao Venerable (Big Shot)!"</p><p></p><p>The Seventy-Two Calamities were also extremely respectful, for they already knew the identity of the young man in green robes before them.</p><p></p><p>Luchang Sheng glanced at the Reincarnation Demon Child and said indifferently, "It's best if you behave yourself, otherwise..."</p><p></p><p>"Big Shot, I won't dare! I was just playing around with them!" the Reincarnation Demon Child hurriedly explained.</p><p></p><p>Luchang Sheng no longer paid attention to him, but instead looked towards the depths of the Soul Realm. He knew that Hunhun and the others were still in the process of fusing their avatars, and it should be completed soon, ready to set out the next day.</p><p></p><p>...</p><p></p><p>The Soul Realm had no concept of day and night, only eternal darkness.</p><p></p><p>But just as Luchang Sheng had expected, about a day later, Hunhun and the four Great Spirits emerged from their seclusion.</p><p></p><p>After seeing Hunhun finish instructing the Seventy-Two Calamities and Thirty-Six Evils on some matters,</p><p></p><p>Luchang Sheng took the Reincarnation Demon Child and Hunhun's group and left the Soul Realm.</p><p></p><p>They were temporarily housed in the Great Dao Demon-Subduing Tower again.</p><p></p><p>Because in the time ahead, Luchang Sheng needed to rush with all his might.</p><p></p><p>In the countless beings' cognition, the Endless Void is infinitely vast, so one can imagine how much time it would take to reach the edge of the Endless Void.</p><p></p><p>Even if the Dao Profundity experts of the Three Thousand Realms were to cross the Void, even if they exhausted their lifespans, they would likely still find it difficult to leave this star domain, let alone reach the edge of the Endless Void.</p><p></p><p>The number of star domains to be traversed before reaching the edge of the Endless Void is innumerable and boundless.</p><p></p><p>It would take Luchang Sheng a considerable amount of time to reach there as well.</p><p></p><p>If he were in his full true body, he could arrive in an instant, but alas, he was only a wisp of his true self.</p><p></p><p>However, the Eight Origin Pillars were also incredibly distant, and the time spent traveling there would likely be substantial.</p><p></p><p>...</p><p></p><p>The boundless and vast Endless Void is supported by the Eight Origin Pillars.</p><p></p><p>The Eight Origin Pillars are positioned in the eight directions: East, South, West, North, Southeast, Northeast, Southwest, and Northwest.</p><p></p><p>They are numbered from the First to the Eighth.</p><p></p><p>The Eighth Origin Pillar.</p><p></p><p>When Luchang Sheng arrived here, ten thousand years had already passed.</p><p></p><p>At this time, outside the Eighth Origin Pillar, Luchang Sheng stood with his hands behind his back, with a sense of being travel-worn.</p><p></p><p>Afterward, Luchang Sheng summoned Old Turtle and the others from the Demon-Subduing Tower.</p><p></p><p>"Hmm? Master, have we finally arrived?" </p><p></p><p>When Old Turtle and Hunhun's group first emerged, they had a blank look on their faces.</p><p></p><p>But very soon, when they saw the dazzling and bizarre seven-colored radiance that stretched out beyond their sight behind Luchang Sheng, they were left speechless, unable to utter a word!</p><p></p><p>The Origin Pillars were immensely massive, and from their current position, it was impossible for them to see the full view with their eyes.</p><p></p><p>If they could see the full view of the Origin Pillar, Luchang Sheng would not have let them out, for that would mean they were still very far away.</p><p></p><p>"This is the Origin Pillar. The various seven-colored radiances you see now are just a small portion of the star systems nurtured by the Origin Pillar. Once these star systems mature, they will depart the Origin Pillar and slowly drift to other parts of the Endless Void."</p><p></p><p>"Whether it's the Four Directions Immortal Realms, the Ancestral Heavenly Realm, or the Heavenly Scar, and all the other worlds we have traversed, they were all derived from the Origin Pillar, and after maturing, they departed the Origin Pillar to drift alone in the Endless Void."</p><p></p><p>Here is the full English translation of the Chinese excerpt:</p><p></p><p>"You can understand that the eight Creation Pillars are the mothers of all the star systems and worlds in the boundless void, they are the ones who gave birth to them."</p><p></p><p>Lu Changsheng said calmly.</p><p></p><p>Upon hearing this, the old turtle and the others revealed expressions of shock, their worldviews being shaken!</p><p></p><p>The relatively weaker He Xitong's gaze became blurred, deeply in a state of shock. At this moment, she felt incredibly insignificant, insignificant to the point of nothingness!</p><p></p><p>In fact, it was not just her, even the old turtle and Hunhui were trembling in their hearts, their faces pale, as if a great terror had descended upon them!</p><p></p><p>They began to frantically doubt themselves in their hearts!</p><p></p><p>They were so small, so what was the purpose of their existence in this world?</p><p></p><p>Only the Reincarnation Demon Child was normal, as he came from one of the Creation Pillars, although perhaps not this one, but the eight Creation Pillars are more or less the same.</p><p></p><p>Seeing He Xitong and the old turtle looking dazed and on the verge of being lost, Lu Changsheng gently waved his sleeve!</p><p></p><p>Instantly, the old turtle and the others snapped back to their senses, but they were still panting heavily, patting their chests with lingering fear!</p><p></p><p>Lu Changsheng chuckled and said, "If I tell you that right now we are at the very bottom of this Creation Pillar, what you see is not even a millionth of the Creation Pillar, how would you feel then?"</p><p></p><p>The old turtle and Hunhui were completely at a loss for words, frantically stabilizing their minds!</p><p></p><p>Fortunately, Lu Changsheng had just helped them stabilize, otherwise they would have been completely lost.</p><p></p><p>The boundless void is so vast, and the Creation Pillars that support it are also so immense! It's unimaginably grand!</p><p></p><p>The Reincarnation Demon Child disdainfully glanced at Hunhui and the others, then looked at Lu Changsheng respectfully and asked, "Senior, what do we do next?"</p><p></p><p>Lu Changsheng turned around, gazing down at the deepest part of the Creation Pillar, and said indifferently, "Of course, we start from the very bottom and work our way up!"</p><p></p><p>The Reincarnation Demon Child's eyes immediately lit up with excitement, nodding vigorously!</p><p></p><p>The old turtle and Hunhui also quickly collected their thoughts, their expressions becoming extremely solemn!</p><p></p><p>They didn't fully understand how difficult this journey would be before. But the moment they arrived at the Creation Pillar, they realized, it's terrifyingly difficult!</p><p></p><p>It's likely a matter of life and death!</p><p></p><p>Those monsters that can damage such a colossal Creation Pillar, how powerful must they be?</p><p></p><p>They couldn't even imagine it!</p><p></p><p>"Hunhui, I'm quite strong now, you better not drag me down!" the old turtle said jokingly, trying to ease the heavy atmosphere.</p><p></p><p>Hunhui didn't bother to respond to the old turtle, but instead stepped forward and asked solemnly, "Venerable One, since the interior of the Creation Pillar is so boundless, even at the bottom, where should we start?"</p><p></p><p>Lu Changsheng smiled faintly, "Don't worry, the Creation Pillar is indeed vast, but the star systems you can see are not the ones we need to concern ourselves with. The ones we're going to are the mother star systems."</p><p></p><p>Mother star systems?!</p><p></p><p>The group was puzzled.</p><p></p><p>Lu Changsheng explained, "The many star systems you see are still in the process of formation, and there is no life in them yet. Even when they mature, they will leave the Creation Pillar. But the mother star systems have living beings within them, and they exist eternally within the Creation Pillar, never leaving."</p><p></p><p>"Those worm-like creatures are targeting the mother star systems. As long as they consume most of the mother star systems within the Creation Pillar, the Creation Pillar will collapse, triggering a chain reaction that will lead to the collapse of the boundless void."</p><p></p><p>"To put it simply, if you think of the Creation Pillar as a human body, then the mother star systems are its bones, organs, blood vessels, and so on... Do you understand now?"</p><p></p><p>"Speaking of which, I suppose the Reincarnation Demon Child must have escaped from one of those mother star systems."</p><p></p><p>Upon hearing this, everyone turned to look at the Reincarnation Demon Child!</p><p></p><p>The Reincarnation Demon Child, seeing everyone's gaze on him, could only nod awkwardly... In fact, he was also quite confused and bewildered.</p>

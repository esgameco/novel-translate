        <div class="content">
            <p>Here is the full English translation of the Chinese excerpt:</p><p></p><p>The Lord of the Wind Phoenix Kingdom noticed that the attack from behind had not arrived, so he knew that it was the Immortal Realm expert who had intervened.</p><p></p><p>The Lord of the Wind Phoenix Kingdom quickly took the opportunity to distance himself from the pursuing Ye Xunwang, his face dark as he said:</p><p></p><p>"Cloud Zuo, I was prepared to have a fair and upright battle with you, but I never expected you to be so treacherous!! Colluding with your Qin Saint to ambush me!!"</p><p></p><p>"Who are you calling the Qin Saint?! Say it again?!" </p><p></p><p>But before Cloud Zuo could speak, Ye Xunwang suddenly became emotional.</p><p></p><p>The Lord of the Wind Phoenix Kingdom was puzzled, not knowing why Ye Xunwang was acting so strangely.</p><p></p><p>At this moment, the people of the Wind Phoenix Kingdom saw that their lord had escaped, and they all secretly heaved a sigh of relief.</p><p></p><p>Realistically speaking, if their king had truly been captured, even though they had Immortal Realm experts, the situation would have become quite difficult for them afterwards.</p><p></p><p>As for the Cloud Mist people, they were dejected after the initial surprise.</p><p></p><p>Such a perfect opportunity had slipped away, and now the Lord of the Wind Phoenix Kingdom would definitely be on high alert, and might even directly summon an Immortal Realm expert...</p><p></p><p>An Immortal Realm expert would be an absolutely devastating blow to the current Cloud Mist!</p><p></p><p>Sure enough, the Lord of the Wind Phoenix Kingdom coldly sneered:</p><p></p><p>"Cloud Zuo, I gave you a chance, but you did not uphold the warrior's code, so don't blame me for what's to come..."</p><p></p><p>As his words fell, the air became deathly silent.</p><p></p><p>The people of the ancient Wind Phoenix Kingdom also respectfully bowed towards the palanquin, just like their lord.</p><p></p><p>As for the people of the ancient Cloud Mist Kingdom, they looked at the palanquin with pained eyes, as a sense of despair gradually rose in their hearts.</p><p></p><p>They truly did not know how to resist an Immortal Realm expert.</p><p></p><p>The next moment, the palanquin curtain was lifted, and a stern-faced, upright old man slowly walked out, his aura alone making everyone feel oppressed.</p><p></p><p>The old man first glanced at Cloud Zuo and the others, then closed his eyes and said, "I've stayed in your ancient Wind Phoenix Kingdom for a while, and the hospitality has been decent, so helping with a small matter like this is no trouble. However, old master has one question."</p><p></p><p>Eh?</p><p></p><p>The Lord of the Wind Phoenix Kingdom was first taken aback, then quickly said, "Please, Your Excellency, ask!"</p><p></p><p>"Mm." The old man lightly responded, then opened his eyes, his gaze flickering as he asked a question that left everyone puzzled:</p><p></p><p>"This incident shouldn't have a big impact on the Heavenly Fragrance City of the ancient Cloud Mist Kingdom, right?"</p><p></p><p>Eh? Heavenly Fragrance City? </p><p></p><p>What place is that? Is it important?</p><p></p><p>The Lord of the Wind Phoenix Kingdom was puzzled, bewildered, flustered, and suspicious.</p><p></p><p>But Cloud Zuo, Ye Xunwang, and Cloud Ao Xie were taken aback. Heavenly Fragrance City, that was a place they were familiar with!</p><p></p><p>If it had been before, they definitely wouldn't have known about such a city,</p><p></p><p>but after the previous incident, they had a very deep impression of it, after all, the Azure Robe Senior had obtained their national capital from there.</p><p></p><p>"Mm?" </p><p></p><p>Seeing the Lord of the Wind Phoenix Kingdom standing there silently for a long time without answering, a hint of displeasure appeared on the old man's face!</p><p></p><p>Sensing this, the Lord of the Wind Phoenix Kingdom trembled and quickly said, "It won't have an impact, it won't have an impact, please rest assured, Your Excellency!!"</p><p></p><p>The Zhu-surnamed old man nodded slightly, secretly heaving a sigh of relief - as long as it didn't have an impact, that was good.</p><p></p><p>Then the old man glanced at Cloud Zuo and Ye Xunwang, his voice solemn: "Old master will help you deal with these two at the peak of the Martial Saint Realm as a return for the hospitality these past days, as for the rest, you'll have to handle it yourself."</p><p></p><p>The Lord of the Wind Phoenix Kingdom was delighted, cupping his hands and saying, "That is more than enough!!"</p><p></p><p>The people of the ancient Cloud Mist Kingdom felt a chill in their hearts!!</p><p></p><p>Especially Cloud Zuo and Ye Xunwang, the two of them could already sense the aura of the Immortal Realm old man completely locking onto them!!</p><p></p><p>The air in the heavens and earth seemed to be congealing at this moment, the heartbeats of the Cloud Mist people accelerating, with beads of sweat the size of beans sliding down their foreheads.</p><p></p><p>At this time, the old man looked at Cloud Zuo and Ye Xunwang and said indifferently:</p><p></p><p>"You two, shall I personally take care of you, or will you end it yourselves?"</p><p></p><p>Cloud Zuo and Ye Xunwang's eyes flickered wildly, secretly frantically accumulating their spiritual energy!!</p><p></p><p>"Brother, why hasn't the Azure Robe Senior made a move yet... we are already in a desperate situation..." Cloud Zuo transmitted in despair.</p><p></p><p>Ye Xunwang pressed his lips, wryly smiling. He discreetly glanced towards the palace direction, not only the Azure Robe Senior, but even the old turtle who had promised to help them was nowhere to be seen, not knowing what they were up to.</p><p></p><p>At the same time, in the Observation Pavilion of the palace.</p><p></p><p>In the old turtle's room, the old turtle was playing and frolicking with the dancing girl. </p><p></p><p>Fearing that the noise would be heard by Lu Changsheng, the old turtle had long cast a spell to isolate the outside world.</p><p></p><p>What Ye Xunwang didn't know was that since the day he had sent the dancing girl to the old turtle, the old turtle had been playing with her until now, not even leaving the room.</p><p></p><p>Even at this moment, the old turtle was still oblivious to the passage of time, happily playing with the dancing girl in the absolutely quiet environment.</p><p></p><p>...</p><p></p><p>Oh?</p><p></p><p>Seeing Cloud Zuo and Ye Xunwang remain silent, a hint of impatience flashed across the old man's face. "Since that's the case, then old master shall personally send you on your way."</p><p></p><p>Here is the full English translation of the Chinese excerpt:</p><p></p><p>The old man finished speaking, his eyes flashing with a sinister light, and a faint ripple began to emanate from around him.</p><p></p><p>This ripple caused everyone present to change color.</p><p></p><p>Profound Spiritual Energy!</p><p></p><p>The Profound Spiritual Energy exclusive to cultivators at the Divine Realm level, was vastly different from the divine elements they cultivated.</p><p></p><p>"Father, Father King! Uncle Ye!" </p><p></p><p>Cloud Ao Xie was now frozen in place, his mind in complete disarray!</p><p></p><p>If that old man were to make a move, his father the King and Uncle Ye would definitely not be able to withstand even a single strike!</p><p></p><p>"Your Majesty!!"</p><p></p><p>The officials and soldiers of Cloud Lan were also terrified, watching this scene unfold.</p><p></p><p>The people of Wind Phoenix Ancient Country sneered coldly at this sight, thinking that as long as Cloud Ze Cang and Ye Xun Mo were to die, Cloud Lan Ancient Country would have no more resistance left!</p><p></p><p>In this extremely critical moment, Cloud Ao Xie suddenly thought of Lu Chang Sheng, and resolutely turned towards the palace, towards the towering structure that seemed to pierce the clouds - the Observation Pavilion.</p><p></p><p>The next moment, Cloud Ao Xie knelt down, tapped into his Majestic Divine Element, and shouted:</p><p></p><p>"Great Sir, Ao Xie begs you, please save my father the King and Uncle Ye!!"</p><p></p><p>Silence fell over the heavens and earth, with only Cloud Ao Xie's voice echoing.</p><p></p><p>Huh?</p><p></p><p>The Wind Phoenix Country Lord and the people of Wind Phoenix Ancient Country had expressions of doubt and uncertainty. Could Cloud Lan Ancient Country still have reinforcements?? </p><p></p><p>What level of reinforcements?</p><p></p><p>At this moment, even the old man slightly furrowed his brows, casting a suspicious glance towards the Observation Pavilion in the palace, but did not think much of it.</p><p></p><p>He did not want to delay any further, and was prepared to help Wind Phoenix Ancient Country this time before leaving.</p><p></p><p>So the old man decisively extended his finger, and the terrifying invisible Profound Spiritual Energy suddenly surged, sweeping towards the two men!</p><p></p><p>Even before the Profound Spiritual Energy arrived, the skin of Cloud Ze Cang and Ye Xun Mo had already cracked, as if scraped by a steel knife!</p><p></p><p>The bones throughout their bodies were even cracking and popping!</p><p></p><p>One could imagine that if the Profound Spiritual Energy were to suppress them, they would likely explode in an instant!</p><p></p><p>"Great Sir!!" </p><p></p><p>Cloud Ao Xie shouted anxiously, his face deathly pale.</p><p></p><p>Just as the Profound Spiritual Energy was about to crush them, Cloud Ze Cang and Ye Xun Mo desperately closed their eyes.</p><p></p><p>In front of them, a azure glow suddenly flashed into existence, gradually forming into the illusory figure of a young man in azure robes.</p><p></p><p>And the moment the illusory azure-robed man appeared, the incoming Profound Spiritual Energy dissipated without a trace.</p><p></p><p>"Great Sir!!" Cloud Ao Xie and the officials were overjoyed.</p><p></p><p>The officials looked at Lu Chang Sheng with reverence, this Great Sir was indeed very powerful, able to block the techniques of a Divine Realm cultivator with just an illusory figure.</p><p></p><p>Cloud Ze Cang and Ye Xun Mo realized they were still alive, sensing the stillness of the heavens and earth, and couldn't help but open their eyes in surprise, joyfully seeing the illusory azure figure, their eyes even reddening, as if they wanted to cry.</p><p></p><p>Great Sir, was that not a bit too thrilling?</p><p></p><p>The people of Wind Phoenix Ancient Country were shocked, seeing the illusory azure-robed man, all realizing that this was not his true body.</p><p></p><p>This unexpected turn of events made the Wind Phoenix Country Lord find it hard to accept. He first looked at Lu Chang Sheng warily, then turned to the old man, wanting to say something...</p><p></p><p>But the next moment, that terrifying old man, under the gaze of countless stunned and bewildered onlookers, suddenly knelt down, his entire body visibly trembling!!</p><p></p><p>"Patriarch, Patriarch, Patriarch..." Zhu Xing Qiu's face was deathly pale, his mouth quivering uncontrollably.</p><p></p><p>Lu Chang Sheng had his hands clasped behind his back, looking down at Zhu Xing Qiu with a faint smile, softly calling out, "Zhu Xing Qiu."</p><p></p><p>"Xing, Xing, Xing Qiu is here, Patriarch, please speak!" Zhu Xing Qiu was kneeling there, his voice trembling, his spirit and soul shaking.</p><p></p><p>Lu Chang Sheng lowered his gaze, seeming to smile yet not smile, "If it were just an ordinary disciple, it would be fine. But you, as the Grand Steward, are cultivating in this remote place that doesn't even have Divine Realm cultivators? Are you bullying and oppressing, or just cultivating?"</p><p></p><p>"Xing...Xing Qiu knows he was wrong!" Zhu Xing Qiu was already terrified, just burying his head, not daring to explain anything to Lu Chang Sheng, only feeling an overwhelming sense of dread within.</p><p></p><p>He had been confined in the Great Dao Demon Subduing Tower for far too long, and after coming out, he had planned to enjoy himself for a while before being caught by the Patriarch.</p><p></p><p>He had originally planned to just help with Wind Phoenix and then flee, but now that he had been caught by the Patriarch, it was all over!</p><p></p><p>The people of Cloud Lan Ancient Country were shocked, never imagining that this terrifying old man was actually a subordinate of the Young Master in azure robes???</p><p></p><p>As for the Wind Phoenix Country Lord and the others, seeing the originally Divine Realm old man now so humbly and fearfully kneeling before the young man, they felt a chill run down their spines!</p><p></p><p>A sense of cold that was indescribable spread throughout their bodies!!</p><p></p><p>Especially Wind Chang Xuan, his eyes dazed as he looked at the illusory azure-robed man. That night, just what kind of existence had he been challenging...</p><p></p><p>Wind Chang Xuan recalled the words of the azure-robed man's servant that night, and a sense of hopeless, speechless, and even laughable emotion spread in his heart.</p><p></p><p>Haha, to have offended such an extraordinary Great Sir, now not only he was doomed, but his father and the others should also be doomed.</p>

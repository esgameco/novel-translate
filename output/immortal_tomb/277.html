        <h1>Chapter 277</h1>
        <div class="content">
            <p>Here is the full English translation of the excerpt from the Chinese novel:</p><p></p><p>The Airspace of the Ouyang Clan. (-_-) Ôºñ‚ùæùï§ùêáùêÆ–ñ.ùìí‡πèùî™ (-_-)</p><p></p><p>Ouyang angrily stood in the air. He blankly looked towards the direction of the Fu Clan, watching the dissipating illusory sun.</p><p></p><p>The next moment, he burst out laughing hysterically: "Hahaha!"</p><p></p><p>Unexpectedly, it was really unexpected. He had just had a small skirmish with Fu Liang, and the next moment, the patriarch of their clan had died?</p><p></p><p>His laughter subsided, and he turned his head to look towards the direction of the Liu Clan in the city.</p><p></p><p>There, Liu Qing was also standing in the air, gazing at him from afar.</p><p></p><p>The two nodded slightly at each other, everything unspoken.</p><p></p><p>Soon,</p><p></p><p>Ouyang flashed back to his clan, and shouted, "Elders, the guardians, gather!"</p><p></p><p>.........</p><p></p><p>Xingyu City was in an uproar, with the undercurrents of various forces surging.</p><p></p><p>The illusory sun that had protected the Fu Clan had dissipated, which many had witnessed with their own eyes.</p><p></p><p>Everyone knew what this meant.</p><p></p><p>"Sigh, as expected, the Xu and Gao Clans have already mobilized their forces and are heading towards the Fu Clan! They don't want to waste a single moment."</p><p></p><p>"Of course, the Xu and Gao Clans are the forces closest in status and strength to the three major clans in Xingyu City. Ever since the decline of the Fu Clan, the Xu and Gao Clans have been coveting the Fu Clan for a long time."</p><p></p><p>"Yes, the passing of the Fu Clan's patriarch today is truly..."</p><p></p><p>"Hehe, without the Fu Clan's patriarch, the Fu Clan is no match for the Xu and Gao Clans. Not to mention the Ouyang Clan and the Liu Clan!"</p><p></p><p>"Let's go, the Fu Clan has completely fallen or even faced extinction today. We should go and see if we can pick up some scraps."</p><p></p><p>"..."</p><p></p><p>Many people were discussing and heading towards the direction of the Fu Clan.</p><p></p><p>At this moment, Xingyu City was in complete chaos.</p><p></p><p>.........</p><p></p><p>At the same time, within the Fu Clan, the people were in a state of panic.</p><p></p><p>The patriarch's sudden and unexpected death had caught them completely off guard. They were not prepared at all.</p><p></p><p>It was obvious that the Ouyang, Liu, Xu, and Gao Clans were rushing towards the Fu Clan!</p><p></p><p>They were about to face a storm.</p><p></p><p>In the Fu Clan's training ground, tens of thousands of people stood.</p><p></p><p>Fu Shiyu, Fu Tao, the elders, and the members of the Fu Clan were all present.</p><p></p><p>Most of them were pale-faced, looking at Fu Liang in front of them.</p><p></p><p>Fu Liang swept his gaze across the crowd and sighed, "Time is of the essence, and the other major clans will likely arrive at our Fu Clan soon. I'm sure you all understand what this means for our clan. So, I won't say any more unnecessary words. I only have one thing to say: our Fu Clan members, even if we have to die, we will die standing! Understand?"</p><p></p><p>"Understood!"</p><p></p><p>Just as they responded, a cold laugh came from outside the clan.</p><p></p><p>"Clan Leader of the Fu Clan, the Xu and Gao Clans have come to visit. May we have a chat?"</p><p></p><p>The people in the training ground were startled. They knew that the Xu and Gao Clans had been coveting the Fu Clan, and they had arrived even faster than a dog.</p><p></p><p>Fu Liang's expression darkened slightly, and he lowered his eyelids before disappearing from the training ground.</p><p></p><p>"None of you are to leave the clan. Elders, listen to my order. Have all the elders and clan members quickly take their positions and be prepared to activate the clan's defensive formation."</p><p></p><p>"Yes."</p><p></p><p>The people in the training ground quickly and orderly left.</p><p></p><p>"Sister... is our Fu Clan really going to be finished today?" Fu Tao's eyes reddened, and he spoke with a bitter tone.</p><p></p><p>Fu Shiyu remained silent.</p><p></p><p>"Sister, let's go find that senior in the blue robe. His strength is definitely not inferior to Father's. With his help, perhaps we can withstand this crisis." Fu Tao took a deep breath and said.</p><p></p><p>Fu Shiyu looked at him: "I..."</p><p></p><p>Here is the full English translation of the Chinese excerpt:</p><p></p><p>"With what can we ask that senior for help? And on what basis would he help our Fu clan?" </p><p></p><p>Fu Tao paused.</p><p></p><p>"Little Tao, that senior is still a guest in our clan now. If he is willing to help, he will naturally help. If we go and ask, it will be to no avail," Fu Shiyu said dejectedly.</p><p></p><p>...</p><p></p><p>Outside the Fu clan, in the distance was a vast crowd of onlookers, their eyes flickering as they watched.</p><p></p><p>In front of the main gate of the Fu clan stood the Xu clan and the Gao clan, with several thousand people from each clan, mostly high-ranking and elite combat forces.</p><p></p><p>They certainly couldn't mobilize their entire forces, or else their main camp would be in some danger.</p><p></p><p>"Hehe, Xu Chong, Gao Teng, are you two so impatient?" </p><p></p><p>Suddenly, Fu Liangcai appeared on the steps of the Fu clan's main gate, sneering at the two leaders below.</p><p></p><p>The patriarch of the Fu clan has come out!</p><p></p><p>The crowd stirred, their eyes fixed on Fu Liangcai, wanting to see a trace of trepidation on his face.</p><p></p><p>But to their disappointment, even though the Fu clan was in dire straits, Fu Liangcai's expression remained calm.</p><p></p><p>"Hehe, Patriarch Fu, your Fu clan is declining, no longer worthy of being one of the three great clans of Jinyun City. You should just abdicate and make way for others, so as not to trouble us..." Gao Teng said with a cold smile on his lips.</p><p></p><p>Xu Chong also had a mocking expression, but his heart was heavy.</p><p></p><p>He discreetly observed the overall situation of the Fu clan out of the corner of his eye.</p><p></p><p>He and Gao Teng had not attacked immediately because they feared the Fu clan's protective formations.</p><p></p><p>After all, the Fu clan was one of the three great clans, and even in their decline, they could not be taken lightly.</p><p></p><p>Fu Liangcai naturally knew what they were thinking, so he replied calmly, "Abdication is impossible... If you have the strength, just attack us directly, why the empty talk?"</p><p></p><p>After saying this, he glanced in the direction of the Ouyang and Liu clans in the city, his gaze heavy with gravity.</p><p></p><p>To be honest, Xu and Gao clans were not even on Fu Liangcai's radar!</p><p></p><p>Xu Chong and Gao Teng's faces darkened with anger, about to speak, but were interrupted by Fu Liangcai's raised hand, with a meaningful implication:</p><p></p><p>"And even if you succeed in conquering my Fu clan, can you two clans really swallow it?"</p><p></p><p>Hearing this, Xu Chong and Gao Teng's expressions changed, their hearts heavy with worry.</p><p></p><p>They knew Fu Liangcai was referring to the Ouyang and Liu clans.</p><p></p><p>This was also a dilemma they had been grappling with.</p><p></p><p>For a moment, the two were hesitant, not knowing what to do.</p><p></p><p>"Hehe," Fu Liangcai coldly chuckled inwardly.</p><p></p><p>This was the situation he wanted to see. Now he really didn't want to waste too much energy and trump cards on these Xu and Gao clans, the court jesters.</p><p></p><p>He only wanted to save all his strength to deal with Ouyang Nuo and Liu Qing.</p><p></p><p>At this moment, Fu Liangcai's gaze suddenly sharpened.</p><p></p><p>The crowd of onlookers outside had also become somewhat chaotic, parting to the sides to make way for a wide path, as if for someone to pass through.</p><p></p><p>The sound of many footsteps approached,</p><p></p><p>Looking out, they saw Ouyang Nuo, wearing a broad smile, leading a group of Ouyang clan disciples!</p><p></p><p>"Hahaha, Patriarch Fu~~ We just met, and now we're meeting again..." </p><p></p><p>Ouyang Nuo laughed as he approached, full of vigor.</p><p></p><p>Xu Chong and Gao Teng took a deep breath and reluctantly moved their own disciples aside.</p><p></p><p>But Ouyang Nuo didn't even glance at them, walking straight towards Fu Liangcai. When he was about twenty paces away, he raised his hand.</p><p></p><p>Immediately, the elders and Ouyang clan members behind him halted their steps.</p>

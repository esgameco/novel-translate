        <h1>Chapter 295</h1>
        <div class="content">
            <p>Here is the full English translation of the excerpt from the Chinese novel:</p><p></p><p>Hearing this, while Fu Shiyu's group remained alert, they looked at the blood-red moon with astonishment. </p><p></p><p>The blood-red moon's eyes flashed, and it shifted its gaze from the bronze mask, gently asking, "Fellow Daoist, may I ask your honorable surname?"</p><p></p><p>Fu Shiyu's group remained silent, naturally knowing that the blood-red moon was asking the senior in blue, not the three of them.</p><p></p><p>"Lu." Lu Changsheng spoke up.</p><p></p><p>"Lu..." the blood-red moon murmured, taking a step closer to Lu Changsheng and cupping his hands: "Fellow Daoist Lu's cultivation is profound. Does the blood-red moon seek to cooperate with you?"</p><p></p><p>Lu Changsheng looked at the blood-red moon with a puzzling gaze, and after a moment, suddenly broke into a happy smile: "Of course it can be done."</p><p></p><p>The blood-red moon was taken aback, the senior's response somewhat exceeding her expectations. She hadn't even said what the cooperation was about, yet the other party had already agreed, which seemed rather hasty.</p><p></p><p>"Fellow Daoist Lu, I haven't even said what the cooperation is..." </p><p></p><p>The blood-red moon didn't finish speaking when Lu Changsheng waved his hand to interrupt her: "It doesn't matter whether we cooperate or not, what's important is..."</p><p></p><p>Saying this, Lu Changsheng suddenly raised his hand and lightly pointed in the air!</p><p></p><p>The blood-red moon paused, not expecting the senior in front of her to suddenly attack without any reason. Her expression then turned stern, and she tried to dodge to the side!</p><p></p><p>But how could she possibly evade Lu Changsheng's attack? In an instant, her entire body froze, and the last conscious thought in her mind before sinking into confusion was: "He's... he's searching my soul!"</p><p></p><p>Beside them, Fu Shiyu's group had been startled by the sudden turn of events, their bodies shivering.</p><p></p><p>Even someone as powerful as the blood-red moon could not withstand a single encounter with the senior. After all, the senior in blue was a sword cultivator, and he didn't even need to use a sword!</p><p></p><p>Could it be that the blood-red moon's cultivation was only at the early stage of the Divine Yang realm? No, that shouldn't be the case, as the top five geniuses were definitely not limited to just the early stage of the Divine Yang realm.</p><p></p><p>Seeing the blood-red moon's unfocused eyes before them, the three knew that the senior was searching her soul!</p><p></p><p>They no longer had the time to ponder why the senior would do that to the blood-red moon. What shocked them now was another matter - the ability to search a soul from a distance. This must require a tremendous gap in cultivation to achieve.</p><p></p><p>Fu Tao and Liu Xing had been so frightened that they were on the verge of collapse, realizing that the senior in blue before them was a supreme expert who could easily overwhelm them.</p><p></p><p>At this moment, Lu Changsheng, who was searching the blood-red moon's soul, had a slight frown on his brow...</p><p></p><p>The moment his spiritual sense entered the blood-red moon's mind, a segment of her memory seemed to have activated a self-protection mechanism and was automatically erased.</p><p></p><p>However, it was not entirely fruitless. At least the identity of this blood-red moon was more or less in line with his expectations.</p><p></p><p>This woman must be controlled first, as she could still be useful for his next step of action after dealing with the Ancient Desolate Sword Clan.</p><p></p><p>Thinking this, Lu Changsheng withdrew his spiritual sense and slowly lowered his arm.</p><p></p><p>Immediately, the blood-red moon let out a painful groan and collapsed to the ground, clutching her head tightly as if it were about to split open.</p><p></p><p>At this moment, aside from the excruciating pain in her mind, the blood-red moon's heart was also in turmoil!</p><p></p><p>As a powerful cultivator at the Divine Storehouse Realm, she had been so easily soul-searched by the young man before her!</p><p></p><p>After a moment, the blood-red moon calmed down a bit. The soul-searching wouldn't cause too much damage to her future cultivation, as the clan had many precious treasures that could restore the spiritual sense.</p><p></p><p>What she was wary of now was the mysterious young man in front of her. Her identity must have been exposed. If she had known earlier how unfathomable this young man was, she would not have taken the risk to come here. It was truly a case of losing both the wolf and the lamb.</p><p></p><p>Here is the full English translation of the Chinese excerpt:</p><p></p><p>The blood-red moon slowly stood up, her voice a bit hoarse: "You... who are you exactly? What is your purpose in attending this Grand Assembly of Celestial Champions?"</p><p></p><p>Lu Changsheng sat cross-legged on the ground, gently replying: "Why don't you tell me first, who are you? What is your purpose in attending this Grand Assembly of Celestial Champions?"</p><p></p><p>The three beside him, Fu Shiyu and the others, were completely bewildered, unable to understand what Lu Changsheng and the blood-red moon were talking about.</p><p></p><p>The blood-red moon pressed her lips together in silence, then said: "It was presumptuous of me to seek your cooperation. Can you... let me go?"</p><p></p><p>Even now, she was not panicked, because deep down she had confidence, believing that the young man before her would be wary of her identity and background.</p><p></p><p>"Don't worry, I won't kill you for now, but from now on, you will only obey me," Lu Changsheng said with a faint smile.</p><p></p><p>Fu Shiyu and the others were stunned.</p><p></p><p>The blood-red moon's expression quickly turned icy cold, her inner power surging. Behind her, a huge, hazy divine shadow gradually appeared, looking even more unfathomable than the Celestial Yang realm's dazzling sun!</p><p></p><p>While the Celestial Yang realm's dazzling sun had a sense of violent aesthetics, the divine shadow looked profound and mysterious.</p><p></p><p>Fu Shiyu and the others were terrified in their souls, instinctively running to hide behind Lu Changsheng.</p><p></p><p>With their knowledge, they had not even witnessed the Three Suns, let alone the divine shadow!</p><p></p><p>They didn't even know what the mysterious shadow behind the blood-red moon represented, only sensing the overwhelming pressure and mystery it carried, which was more terrifying than the Celestial Yang realm they had seen.</p><p></p><p>"Fellow Daoist Lu, I, the Blood Demon Moon, will not just sit and wait for my demise!" The Blood Demon Moon gritted her teeth, and her countless strands of hair began to sway without wind, appearing quite demonic.</p><p></p><p>Blood Demon Moon? Is this the blood-red moon's true name? Fu Shiyu and the others' eyes flickered.</p><p></p><p>Suddenly, a faint blue light flashed in Lu Changsheng's pupils as he calmly said, "Look into my eyes."</p><p></p><p>The Blood Demon Moon's gaze shifted, instinctively looking into Lu Changsheng's eyes, and in just a moment, she fell deeply into them, her eyes becoming hazy and unable to break free.</p><p></p><p>The next instant, to the shock of Fu Shiyu and the others, she knelt down before Lu Changsheng, her voice respectful and gentle.</p><p></p><p>"Master."</p><p></p><p>Lu Changsheng indifferently said, "Don't be an eyesore to me. Go do your own thing."</p><p></p><p>At this moment, the Blood Demon Moon was completely obedient to Lu Changsheng. She immediately bowed respectfully and then turned to leave.</p><p></p><p>"Master, Demon Moon takes her leave."</p><p></p><p>Fu Shiyu and the others watched the red-robed figure disappear into the space, speechless.</p><p></p><p>Fu Tao and Liu Xing snapped out of their daze, involuntarily swallowing hard, the envy practically dripping from their eyes.</p><p></p><p>Their senior had actually taken the beautiful, powerful top celestial champion, the Blood Moon, as his maid... Just thinking about it was thrilling!</p><p></p><p>And from what they just witnessed, that Blood Moon was undoubtedly the most mysterious and powerful celestial champion in this session, aside from their senior.</p><p></p><p>Just based on the unfathomable shadow behind her, it was definitely not something a Celestial Yang realm champion could possess.</p><p></p><p>The realms beyond Celestial Yang were... Celestial Crypt, Celestial Dao...</p><p></p><p>The Blood Moon, Celestial Crypt realm!!</p><p></p><p>Such a terrifying realm... could it really appear among these celestial champions?</p><p></p><p>The three of them suddenly began to ponder the Blood Moon's background with a sense of dread.</p><p></p><p>What shocked them even more was that a supreme celestial champion of the Celestial Crypt realm like the Blood Moon was so easily controlled by their senior.</p><p></p><p>Lu Changsheng closed his eyes and smiled, "You don't need to think too much about it. That Blood Demon Moon is the Holy Maiden of the Ancient Moon Blood Clan, one of the Eight Great Ancient Clans."</p>

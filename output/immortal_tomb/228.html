        <h1>Chapter 228</h1>
        <div class="content">
            <p>Here is my translation of the Chinese excerpt:</p><p></p><p>Incredible!</p><p></p><p>Doctor Lu only placed a purple-green leaf, of some unknown medicinal herb, near the child's nose for a while, and the child woke up. üî•üçÆ‚ùªÔºô·îï–Ωùìæùêó.Âåö·ªñùê¶üí•üíö</p><p></p><p>And the child looked to be in excellent condition.</p><p></p><p>Tongxin, who was standing by, was shocked. Although he had already mentally prepared himself, he still did not expect the doctor's medical skills to be so extraordinary!</p><p></p><p>If it were him, he would never be able to achieve this. He could only gently nourish the child's five zang organs with immortal qi, or concoct a healing elixir, but the child might not be able to withstand the potency of the elixir.</p><p></p><p>Just how is the doctor... why does it feel like there is nothing in the world that the doctor cannot do?</p><p></p><p>The woman cried tears of joy, lowering her head to press her face against the child's face.</p><p></p><p>The big man also snapped out of his shock, letting out a long sigh of relief. He affectionately ruffled the child's head, then looked at Luchang with moist eyes, almost kneeling down again, but was once more lifted up by Luchang, who smiled and said, </p><p></p><p>"This is a medical clinic, not a temple. Don't keep kneeling all the time."</p><p></p><p>The big man felt a little embarrassed, but then said gratefully: "Doctor Lu, you truly deserve it. If it weren't for you, I don't know what would have happened to my child..."</p><p></p><p>Luchang smiled, winked at the child in the woman's embrace, then went to lie down on the rocking chair.</p><p></p><p>Seeing this, the woman discreetly nudged the dazed big man.</p><p></p><p>The big man understood. He recalled his previous words, his heart trembling, but then he looked at the healthy child and steeled his resolve, saying, "Doctor, tonight I will sell my family property..."</p><p></p><p>But before he could finish, Luchang raised five fingers: "Five copper coins."</p><p></p><p>The big man and the woman were puzzled for a moment, then their eyes widened in disbelief.</p><p></p><p>It was so cheap, just the cost of two meals.</p><p></p><p>While the two were still stunned, Tongxin reached out his hand and chuckled, "Uncle, Auntie, five copper coins."</p><p></p><p>"Okay, okay, little doctor." The big man hurriedly took out five copper coins and handed them to Tongxin.</p><p></p><p>Then the two of them deeply bowed to Luchang and left.</p><p></p><p>"Sir, our clinic charges so little for treatment..."</p><p></p><p>Tongxin weighed the five copper coins in his palm and muttered.</p><p></p><p>These five copper coins were only enough to buy ten steamed buns.</p><p></p><p>"The common people have their own value, and the cultivators have their own value," Luchang softly said with his eyes closed.</p><p></p><p>Tongxin suddenly understood.</p><p></p><p>.........</p><p></p><p>The next day.</p><p></p><p>The couple from last night were happily chatting on the street, praising Luchang's medical clinic to everyone they met.</p><p></p><p>The news of Doctor Luchang's excellent medical skills and affordable treatment fees at the Lusheng Clinic soon spread.</p><p></p><p>"Have you heard? Last night, the Chen family took their child to Doctor Luchang."</p><p></p><p>"Of course I've heard, Old Chen himself told me this morning. It was late at night, but thankfully there was Doctor Luchang, or else their child might have been in mortal danger."</p><p></p><p>"The Lusheng Clinic is great, Doctor Luchang is truly a benevolent healer. Just a couple of meals' worth to treat a patient, in our Smoke and Rain Town, Doctor Luchang doesn't seem to be making much money at all."</p><p></p><p>"Ah, we should send some land and food over there."</p><p></p><p>Meanwhile,</p><p></p><p>The Lusheng Clinic had opened, but it was rather quiet, a stark contrast to the bustling Tianzhi Pavilion Liquor House.</p><p></p><p>After all, not everyone gets sick every day.</p><p></p><p>Here is the full English translation of the Chinese excerpt:</p><p></p><p>Tongxin saw that there were no patients coming to the clinic at the moment, so he paid his respects to Lu Changsheng, who was sitting there drinking tea and reading, and then went out to the street.</p><p></p><p>He still remembered that the master had asked him to find another apprentice for the clinic yesterday.</p><p></p><p>A moment later, Tongxin arrived at the bustling main street.</p><p></p><p>"Oh, isn't this the young doctor? Have you had breakfast yet? Come, come, my freshly baked oil cakes are ready, I'll treat you for free!"</p><p></p><p>"Tsk, what's so good about oil cakes? Young doctor, how did you like the steamed buns yesterday? Are you coming to the old man's place again today? They're free today!"</p><p></p><p>"Oh oh oh, you all just want to get close to the young doctor to curry favor with Master Lu, don't you? Your schemes are so obvious, even Madam at Spring Fragrance Pavilion can hear them clearly. Young doctor, why don't you come visit the Spring Fragrance Pavilion? There are so many beautiful sisters there!"</p><p></p><p>"Ah, no need, no need... Thank you all for your kindness, and just call me Tongxin, don't call me 'young doctor' anymore."</p><p></p><p>Tongxin's face flushed red as he fled from the street.</p><p></p><p>"Haha, this young doctor from the clinic is so pure and shy, how nice, Tongxin... Tsk tsk."</p><p></p><p>"Tch, you old pimp, I warn you, Tongxin is the apprentice of the Long Life Clinic, your Spring Fragrance Pavilion better not cause any trouble! Otherwise, everyone will not go easy on your Spring Fragrance Pavilion! You... you dare come at me!"</p><p></p><p>"Tch, you old scoundrel, at your age can you even still get it up? Just all talk!"</p><p></p><p>"Haha."</p><p></p><p>Seeing the mocking expressions on everyone's faces, the bun shop owner's face turned red with anger, and he pointed at the Spring Fragrance Pavilion's madam but couldn't say a word.</p><p></p><p>He sighed, glanced in the direction of the Long Life Clinic, and made a decision in his heart.</p><p></p><p>Immediately, he turned around and closed up shop amidst the bewildered gazes of the crowd...</p><p></p><p>...</p><p></p><p>Tongxin felt a great sense of relief as he moved away from that street, wiping the sweat from his brow. He was still a bit shaken.</p><p></p><p>The others weren't too bad, but that madam from the brothel looked at him like she wanted to devour him, which was a bit frightening.</p><p></p><p>He had been terrified at the time.</p><p></p><p>Even when he participated in the battle beyond his level and fought against the junior patriarch of the Great Sun Thunder Sect, he had never been so nervous.</p><p></p><p>The people on this street were also very enthusiastic, thankfully without the incident from the Spring Fragrance Pavilion.</p><p></p><p>It seems that the Spring Fragrance Pavilion is the only brothel in Smoke and Rain Town.</p><p></p><p>Tongxin wandered the street, his brow furrowed, unable to find a suitable candidate for a long time.</p><p></p><p>After a while, as if he had thought of something, his eyes lit up.</p><p></p><p>He then looked around at the street stalls and shouted loudly, "The Long Life Clinic is recruiting an apprentice! There's only one position available, does anyone have a good candidate?"</p><p></p><p>Wow!</p><p></p><p>The street immediately erupted in an uproar, with everyone stopping their work:</p><p></p><p>"Young doctor, my second son Niu can do it! My second Niu is such a well-behaved and hardworking child!"</p><p></p><p>"Tch, your second Niu may be well-behaved, but he's a bit slow-witted. Can he handle the delicate work of an apprentice? Young doctor, don't listen to her, my child is much better..."</p><p></p><p>"Yeah, your child is great, your old Zhao sells tofu for a living but your child is always spending the money at the Spring Fragrance Pavilion, your child is really good!"</p><p></p><p>"..."</p><p></p><p>Listening to the endless comments, Tongxin was dumbfounded.</p><p></p><p>It seems that none of them are normal...</p><p></p><p>This is going to be quite difficult...</p><p></p><p>Just then, a little girl ran out from a side alley, running up to Tongxin and looking up at him, pointing to herself.</p><p></p><p>The meaning was clear.</p><p></p><p>Tongxin was slightly taken aback. He looked down and examined the little girl for a moment, his gaze hesitant.</p><p></p><p>The little girl had her hair in a bun, wearing a simple floral dress with some patches, but it was very clean.</p><p></p><p>Tongxin asked hesitantly, "Are you volunteering?"</p>

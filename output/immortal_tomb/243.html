            <p>Here is the full English translation of the Chinese excerpt:</p><p></p><p>Outside the Medical Clinic.</p><p></p><p>Su Lianyi looked at the clinic gate with fear in her eyes. To her, the gate was like the gates of hell - once she stepped through, it would be certain death.</p><p></p><p>"Mmm, mmm."</p><p></p><p>Su Lianyi turned her head to look at Yun Meixi, her eyes bloodshot, wanting to say something, but her mouth was sealed by Yuan Yang Qiu, so she couldn't even transmit a voice message.</p><p></p><p>But Yun Meixi could still vaguely hear that Su Lianyi was saying "Master, save me."</p><p></p><p>"Sect Leader Yun, this is the place. Let's go in and meet the senior."</p><p></p><p>Yuan Yang Qiu's lips curled up slightly as he grabbed Su Lianyi and strode into the medical clinic.</p><p></p><p>Yun Meixi's brow furrowed slightly as she followed them in.</p><p></p><p>Inside the Medical Clinic.</p><p></p><p>Lu Changsheng and Tong Xin were not there.</p><p></p><p>A group of old men were crowded around Xiao Tong, making a ruckus.</p><p></p><p>"Ah, Tong'er, you don't have to be so serious! Reading books also requires moderation, Grandpa Lu has invited you to his house for a meal twice, but you always say next time."</p><p></p><p>"That's right, Tong'er, this time so many of us old bones have come to invite you, you little girl better not be ungrateful!"</p><p></p><p>"This girl really is..."</p><p></p><p>Xiao Tong listened to the chatter around her, smiling awkwardly. She couldn't help it, she still hadn't finished learning medical theory, and the assessment was coming up soon.</p><p></p><p>She then went around and poured tea for each of them.</p><p></p><p>"Grandpa Lu, Grandpa Xu, all you elders, you must be thirsty, have some tea~"</p><p></p><p>Seeing this, the group of old men grumbled a bit, then quieted down and came to sit at the long table, ready to enjoy the tea.</p><p></p><p>Just then, Yuan Yang Qiu's group entered.</p><p></p><p>The moment they entered, Yuan Yang Qiu froze.</p><p></p><p>What did he see?</p><p></p><p>He saw a group of ordinary old men sitting there, about to drink the peerless precious tea!</p><p></p><p>Not only was this a waste, but the tea contained something that these ordinary old men's bodies could not withstand. If they drank it, they would surely explode and die!</p><p></p><p>The next moment, Yuan Yang Qiu's face became urgent as he shouted loudly, "Shut up!! You shut up!!"</p><p></p><p>Huh?</p><p></p><p>The old men, with the tea cups halfway to their mouths, were abruptly halted.</p><p></p><p>They looked blankly at the three people who had entered the medical clinic, their suspicious gaze sweeping over the bound Su Lianyi.</p><p></p><p>Ah, this goddess, wasn't she the one who had asked them earlier on the street for the location of the Longevity Medical Clinic?</p><p></p><p>What's going on here.</p><p></p><p>And at this moment, Yun Meixi's gaze was focused on Xiao Tong, her eyes shaking.</p><p></p><p>It really is... the Jade Maiden Physique.</p><p></p><p>"You bunch of old fools, taking advantage of the doctor's absence to secretly drink the peerless precious tea, are you looking to die?"</p><p></p><p>Yuan Yang Qiu hurriedly walked over and, in the bewildered gaze of the old men, unceremoniously removed the tea cups from their hands and placed them on the table.</p><p></p><p>What's wrong, drinking a cup of tea is looking to die...they felt they didn't understand.</p><p></p><p>They had been drinking tea at Lu the Doctor's medical clinic before, and Lu the Doctor himself had poured it for them before.</p><p></p><p>Wasn't this just the ordinary tea used to entertain guests?</p><p></p><p>But considering the other party was a Immortal, and this was Lu the Doctor's medical clinic, to avoid causing trouble for Lu the Doctor, the group of old men swallowed their resentment.</p><p></p><p>Seeing this, Yuan Yang Qiu's brow furrowed as he said, "Ah~ It seems this group of ordinary old men are still a bit dissatisfied?"</p><p></p><p>"Do you know that just now, I secretly saved your lives!"</p><p></p><p>"Is this how you treat your savior?"</p><p></p><p>Yuan Yang Qiu became more and more indignant, truly feeling that his good intentions were being taken as a donkey's liver and lungs.</p><p></p><p>If it weren't for being in the doctor's medical clinic, he would have taught this group of old men a lesson in proper conduct.</p><p></p><p>The old men were dumbfounded, looking at Yuan Yang Qiu blankly.</p><p></p><p>Saved our lives?</p><p></p><p>Please, we're really confused right now!</p><p></p><p>What did you do that saved our lives?</p><p></p><p>Xiao Tong was also somewhat stunned, but her astonishment was not because of Yuan Yang Qiu and the elders, but because of the bound Su Lianyi...</p><p></p><p>Just as everyone was staring at each other in a strange atmosphere, Lu Changsheng and Tong Xin entered the medical clinic one after the other.</p><p></p><p>Su Lianyi's pupils suddenly contracted!</p><p></p><p>Yun Meixi immediately turned her gaze towards the blue-robed young man, her gaze fixed on his refined and aloof face, and her heart also began to tremble.</p><p></p><p>Four words flashed in her mind - unfathomable.</p><p></p><p>And Xiao Tong breathed a sigh of relief, about to happily go greet them, when Yuan Yang Qiu beat her to it, taking a sliding step forward.</p><p></p><p>Here is the full English translation of the Chinese excerpt:</p><p></p><p>He rushed over, bowed and said respectfully, "Senior... Doctor, Yangqiu has not failed the mission and has brought the vile woman Su Lianyi here!"</p><p></p><p>The old men were all shocked on their faces. How could this middle-aged cultivator be so respectful towards Doctor Lu?</p><p></p><p>Goodness, Doctor Lu was actually a cultivator, and an extraordinary one at that.</p><p></p><p>If that's the case, then Doctor Lu must be the most special cultivator they had ever seen.</p><p></p><p>He has such a good temper, able to get along so well with ordinary people like them.</p><p></p><p>"Mm." </p><p></p><p>Lu Changsheng didn't even glance at Su Lianyi, and came to sit down at the long table.</p><p></p><p>The old men hurriedly shifted their positions, looking at Lu Changsheng with even more reverence than before. They had no intention of leaving for now.</p><p></p><p>They felt like they were about to witness an exciting show.</p><p></p><p>As for Tongxin, he picked up the rag and started pretending to clean, but his gaze kept stealing glances.</p><p></p><p>"Gentlemen, why aren't you drinking the tea? It will get cold soon."</p><p></p><p>Lu Changsheng swept a glance at the tea on the table and smiled.</p><p></p><p>"Ah, we're drinking, we're drinking!"</p><p></p><p>"Yes, we're drinking it, Doctor Lu. We momentarily forgot just now."</p><p></p><p>The old men hastily picked up the tea, then inexplicably glanced at the bewildered Yangqiu with a hint of provocation in their eyes.</p><p></p><p>Since Doctor Lu was more powerful than this middle-aged cultivator, they weren't afraid of implicating Doctor Lu's clinic either.</p><p></p><p>They weren't really cultivators at all, just a bunch of old men nearing the end of their lives. How could they still care about the face of cultivators?</p><p></p><p>They then started drinking the tea.</p><p></p><p>Yangqiu reached out his hand, wanting to stop them, his face full of regret and helplessness.</p><p></p><p>He regretted the waste of the priceless tea cups, and was helpless because these old men were courting death without even knowing it.</p><p></p><p>He had figured it out - these ordinary old men had probably offended a senior, and the senior had graciously provided the tea, intending for them to explode.</p><p></p><p>Alas, the lives of mortals are as insignificant as ants. Although Yangqiu didn't want to see these old men die, he didn't dare to interfere with the senior's decision.</p><p></p><p>But moments later, </p><p></p><p>Yangqiu stared blankly at the group of old men who were unharmed, puzzled.</p><p></p><p>What happened? Weren't they supposed to explode?</p><p></p><p>At this time, a flash of light passed through Lu Changsheng's eyes, and Su Lianyi was able to speak again.</p><p></p><p>Realizing this, Su Lianyi suddenly knelt down and kowtowed, pleading, "Senior, spare Lianyi's life!! Lianyi was momentarily confused, momentarily confused!!"</p><p></p><p>Thud, thud, thud...</p><p></p><p>The clinic was silent, except for the sound of Su Lianyi's continuous kowtows.</p><p></p><p>The old men kept their eyes downcast, but their hearts were trembling.</p><p></p><p>They stole glances at the usually gentle Doctor Lu, not knowing what to make of the situation.</p><p></p><p>It seemed a bit different from what they had imagined.</p><p></p><p>Yangqiu and Yunmei remained silent on the side.</p><p></p><p>"Sir, what happened to... Sister Su?" </p><p></p><p>Little Tong looked at the pitiful state of the sister who had once treated her to a big meal, her eyes reddening as she gathered the courage to ask tremulously.</p><p></p><p>Before Lu Changsheng could speak, Su Lianyi suddenly looked at Little Tong, pleading through her tears, "Little... Tong, it's Sister Su's fault, can you forgive Sister Su this time... Can you please go plead with the senior for me?"</p><p></p><p>Seeing the blood on Su Lianyi's forehead, Little Tong was confused but also felt pity. She looked at Lu Changsheng: "Sir..."</p><p></p><p>Lu Changsheng looked at Little Tong and said calmly, "You don't need to ask me. She has actually offended you. I only helped you a little since you are the pharmacy apprentice in my clinic. Whether she lives or dies is up to you to decide."</p><p></p><p>Offended her? </p><p></p><p>Hearing this, Little Tong became even more puzzled.</p><p></p><p>But Su Lianyi was delighted. She looked pitifully at Little Tong, "Little Tong..."</p><p></p><p>"Sir, what did Sister Su do to offend Little Tong?" Little Tong asked hesitantly, lowering her head.</p><p></p><p>Lu Changsheng, however, just sipped his tea without responding further.</p><p></p><p>At this point, Yangqiu, unable to bear it any longer, sighed, "Young lady, it seems you don't know anything. This so-called Sister Su actually wanted to put you to death!"</p><p></p><p>Immediately, Yangqiu quickly recounted the entire sequence of events to Little Tong.</p><p></p><p>The old men listened with widened, angry eyes. They never expected the twists and turns to be so intricate - this so-called goddess was actually such a vicious person! </p><p></p><p>Wanting to kill Tong? This was unforgivable, they must kill her! </p><p></p><p>Little Tong's eyes slowly widened, her pupils trembling as she looked unbelievingly at the woman who had once treated her to a big meal.</p><p></p><p>Under this gaze, Su Lianyi felt extremely guilty and ashamed, unable to meet Little Tong's eyes.</p><p></p><p>"So you see, she has offended you the most. Whether to forgive her or not is up to you..."</p><p></p><p>Lu Changsheng turned his head slightly, looking at Little Tong with eyes as deep as an abyss.</p><p></p><p>Little Tong stared at Su Lianyi for a long time. Her heart initially softened, unable to be ruthless, but a faint, uncontrollable icy blue light suddenly flashed in her eyes, disappearing in an instant.</p><p></p><p>"Sir, she cannot be forgiven."</p>

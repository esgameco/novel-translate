        <h1>Chapter 477</h1>
        <div class="content">
            <p>Here is the full English translation of the Chinese excerpt:</p><p></p><p>Next, under the plundering of the sea cultivators, the majority of the precious treasures on the cultivators' bodies were thoroughly looted.</p><p></p><p>Although the cultivators were unwilling, they had no means to resist. </p><p></p><p>The cultivators even secretly activated the mysterious spiritual powers within their bodies. As long as the situation went awry, they would immediately take action - they would not passively await their demise!</p><p></p><p>Now they did not act, only because they still had a faint glimmer of hope in their hearts.</p><p></p><p>Soon, a few sea cultivators came to the last row of the male cultivator camp, which was where Luchang Sheng, Chen Pang, and Xiao Chai were located.</p><p></p><p>At this moment, all the gazes on the ship were nervously focused on this side.</p><p></p><p>Because as soon as the cultivators in this last row were looted, they would then be able to fully understand the intentions of the sea cultivators, which was also their own fate - death, or a slim chance of survival...</p><p></p><p>"Hey, you all! Hand over the treasures on your bodies, quickly!" the ruthless sea cultivator growled.</p><p></p><p>The other cultivators in the last row silently opened their storage spaces, and the sea cultivators, seeing this, were slightly satisfied. Then they glared viciously at Luchang Sheng and the other two: "And you three, hurry up!"</p><p></p><p>Chen Pang's lips trembled, terrified, and then he exchanged a glance with Xiao Chai. The two of them tremblingly opened their storage spaces.</p><p></p><p>On this side of the Three Thousand Worlds, they were also from humble origins, and in fact had hardly any treasures on them. So even if their worldly possessions were robbed, they were not too concerned about it.</p><p></p><p>At this moment, what they wanted most was to survive.</p><p></p><p>"Hmm?"</p><p></p><p>At this time, Luchang Sheng, who had been standing still without any action, caught the attention of all the cultivators and sea cultivators!</p><p></p><p>Uh, this azure-robed cultivator...</p><p></p><p>"I told you to open your storage space, can't you hear?! Are your ears deaf?!"</p><p></p><p>The sea cultivator lost his patience, glaring coldly at Luchang Sheng.</p><p></p><p>Beside him, Chen Pang and Xiao Chai suddenly became anxious, and in their worry, they hurriedly transmitted a message to Luchang Sheng:</p><p></p><p>"Fellow Daoist Luchang, as long as the green hills remain, there will be no shortage of firewood. Let's just hand over the treasures to him. Even if we give them, we may not necessarily live, but if we don't give them, we will definitely die!"</p><p></p><p>"Fellow Daoist Luchang..."</p><p></p><p>Chen Pang and Xiao Chai's transmission was filled with tension and worry. After they finished, seeing that Luchang Sheng remained unmoved, their hearts became even more anxious.</p><p></p><p>"Bang!"</p><p></p><p>Suddenly, the ruthless sea cultivator unexpectedly exploded into a mist of blood!</p><p></p><p>The entire Sea Transport Number Three fell into deathly silence!</p><p></p><p>Not only were the stunned cultivators amazed, even the group of sea cultivators stared with disbelief at this scene!</p><p></p><p>Chen Pang and Xiao Chai were shaken, their pupils contracting. They discreetly glanced at the calm Luchang Sheng, their gazes filled with bewilderment and shock.</p><p></p><p>"Who? Who was it! Come out!!"</p><p></p><p>The demonic cultivator leader regained his senses and angrily glared at the group of cultivators, who hurriedly shook their heads and backed away, indicating it was not them.</p><p></p><p>Due to the cultivators' retreat, Luchang Sheng, Chen Pang, and Xiao Chai, who were standing still, quickly became the focus of attention!</p><p></p><p>Immediately, all gazes turned towards them again!</p><p></p><p>Chen Pang was terrified, his calves trembling, and Xiao Chai was not much better off.</p><p></p><p>The pressure they felt at this moment was only known to themselves.</p><p></p><p>"Since it wasn't you two, why are you just standing there?" </p><p></p><p>Luchang Sheng suddenly turned his head and lightly asked the two.</p><p></p><p>Chen Pang and Xiao Chai opened their mouths, hesitant, not knowing what to say.</p><p></p><p>They had actually already vaguely guessed that it was Luchang Sheng who did it, although they didn't know how Luchang Sheng accomplished it. But now they had no time to ponder further.</p><p></p><p>They only knew that although they had only known Luchang Sheng for a short time, they instinctively could not bring themselves to abandon him.</p><p></p><p>In their line of work, they valued camaraderie.</p><p></p><p>"Was it you?!"</p><p></p><p>At this time, the demonic cultivator leader coldly stared at Luchang Sheng, gritting his teeth and asking.</p><p></p><p>Luchang Sheng's mouth curled up slightly, and with a finger forming a sword, without any further ado, he lightly slashed out!</p><p></p><p>"Jing!"</p><p></p><p>Only a sword's cry resounded in the vast sea.</p><p></p><p>Immediately, countless sword beams criss-crossed in the space, illuminating the dark night like broad daylight!</p><p></p><p>Swoosh swoosh swoosh swoosh swoosh--!</p><p></p><p>Rumble rumble--</p><p></p><p>In the next moment, those nine massive sea cultivator ships suddenly split into four or five pieces, collapsing and emitting a huge commotion, before gradually sinking into the depths of the sea!</p><p></p><p>Everyone stared blankly at this scene, their bodies shivering with cold!</p><p></p><p>Chen Pang and Xiao Chai exchanged a horrified glance, then carefully glanced at Luchang Sheng's side profile, and finally cautiously moved a distance away.</p><p></p><p>The group of sea cultivators stared blankly at this scene, their bodies slightly trembling. They had a premonition that this time, they might have stepped on a steel plate!</p><p></p><p>If it was just the destruction of nine ordinary ships, they would not have felt this way.</p><p></p><p>Here is the full English translation of the Chinese excerpt:</p><p></p><p>How special.</p><p></p><p>But the problem is!</p><p></p><p>To be able to traverse this vast sea safely, the materials used to make the ships are not ordinary materials, at the very least they need to be hard, able to withstand the attacks of sea monsters and all kinds of strange creatures!</p><p></p><p>But now, all nine ships have been casually destroyed by this Taoist monk, it's truly terrifying!</p><p></p><p>The demonic cultivator leader regained his senses, realizing something was wrong, his tone also became a bit softer,</p><p></p><p>"You, what do you mean? You actually destroyed our ships......"</p><p></p><p>Tap, tap, tap......</p><p></p><p>Lu Changsheng walked on the deck with his hands behind his back, at this moment the only sound on the entire Sea Transport No. 3 was his oppressive footsteps.</p><p></p><p>Soon, Lu Changsheng walked up to the demonic cultivator leader and looked at him indifferently:</p><p></p><p>"I'm in a good mood today, so I'll give you a chance to live. Within ten breaths, get out of here."</p><p></p><p>Hearing this, the crowd trembled inwardly and fell silent.</p><p></p><p>However, the demonic cultivator leader's eyes turned red as he glared at Lu Changsheng and shouted:</p><p></p><p>"You have destroyed all our ships, and then tell us to get out, saying it's a chance for us to live??"</p><p></p><p>Without the ships, how could they retreat?</p><p></p><p>In this sea area, whether it's going into the sea or escaping into the sky, it would be certain death!!</p><p></p><p>Upon hearing this, Lu Changsheng just looked at him, expressionless.</p><p></p><p>Suddenly, a vague, terrifying pressure from a superior being swept over the demonic cultivator leader!!</p><p></p><p>The demonic cultivator leader became increasingly panicked, but in this panic, he was also somewhat cornered, and he roared:</p><p></p><p>"This leader knows that your cultivation is profound, but don't think that destroying nine ships can intimidate us, the ruthless demonic cultivators of the sea!"</p><p></p><p>The cultivators on the ship watched this scene excitedly, amazed that there was a powerful figure hidden on their ship!</p><p></p><p>Unexpectedly, unexpectedly!</p><p></p><p>Their ship actually had a big shot hidden!</p><p></p><p>At this moment, Lu Changsheng was undoubtedly the only lifeline for the cultivators!</p><p></p><p>"Sir, please save us, I would rather give you my treasures than let these pirates have them!"</p><p></p><p>"Senior, I am willing to offer all my treasures to you, please spare my life!"</p><p></p><p>"......"</p><p></p><p>Suddenly, all the cultivators on the Sea Transport No. 3 knelt down, begging Lu Changsheng to save them!</p><p></p><p>Everyone was smart, giving treasures to the demonic cultivators would mean death, but giving treasures to the Taoist monk at least meant they could live!</p><p></p><p>What could be more important than staying alive!</p><p></p><p>The group of demonic cultivators looked at this scene, momentarily panicked, they really hit a steel plate today!</p><p></p><p>"Okay, okay! This leader wants to see your abilities!!"</p><p></p><p>The demonic cultivator leader's mentality was also somewhat broken, he suddenly gestured, and waves of powerful law force surged forth!!</p><p></p><p>Such a rich law force!</p><p></p><p>The cultivators saw this and were terrified in their hearts!</p><p></p><p>"Boom! Boom! Boom! Boom! Boom!..."</p><p></p><p>Suddenly, a series of explosive sounds rang out, one after another!</p><p></p><p>Everyone looked over, and were shocked to see that the entire group of demonic cultivators were exploding into bloody mist one by one!!</p><p></p><p>"No, no... Boom!"</p><p>"What is this, what is this?! Ah... Boom!"</p><p>"No, leader, save us... Boom!"</p><p>"Monster, monster!! Boom!"</p><p>"......"</p><p></p><p>At this moment, everyone was panicked and frightened, covering their heads and crouching on the ground, even fearing that the next explosion would be them!</p><p></p><p>Chen Pang and Xiao Chai stood there stiffly, their minds blank!</p><p></p><p>The entire ship was filled with endless bloodshed and slaughter!</p><p></p><p>It was as if there was a Grim Reaper with a scythe, ruthlessly reaping lives!</p><p></p><p>The demonic cultivator leader's movements even froze, he looked at this bizarre scene in horror, his mind completely shattered! What kind of law was this?</p><p></p><p>The demonic cultivator leader finally had a complete mental breakdown, no longer having the will to resist, he stumbled and half-knelt on the ground, looking up at the Taoist monk in fear.</p><p></p><p>"You, you are a demon..."</p><p></p><p>Lu Changsheng glanced at the demonic cultivator leader indifferently, as if looking at an ant, then turned around with his hands behind his back and no longer looked at him, his words surprisingly calm,</p><p></p><p>"The ten breaths are up, don't you know?"</p><p></p><p>As soon as the words fell, the demonic cultivator leader's face changed drastically, and he hurriedly got up and tried to jump into the sea!</p><p></p><p>Boom!!</p><p></p><p>The next moment, the demonic cultivator leader exploded into a bloody mist!</p><p></p><p>The night sky became quiet, only the faint sound of waves lapping against the surface of the sea.</p>

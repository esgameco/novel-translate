        <h1>Chapter 491</h1>
        <div class="content">
            <p>Here is the full English translation of the Chinese excerpt:</p><p></p><p>Since Qing and Lin were present, all the cultivators from those forces retreated and sat down to cultivate silently, waiting for the next wave.</p><p></p><p>Chen Pang and Xiao Chai were also spared, but they were even more afraid of going to Tiantian Island.</p><p></p><p>They had just arrived at the island and were almost about to die.</p><p></p><p>"Alright, everyone, we just happened to be here and helped you this time. After arriving at the island, you'll have to rely on yourselves."</p><p></p><p>Lin put the hat back on and smiled.</p><p></p><p>"Thank you, senior Elves!" Chen Pang and the others hurriedly bowed in gratitude.</p><p></p><p>Qing and Lin nodded slightly, then turned their heads and glanced at the man in blue robes still on the ship, bowed slightly, and went into the island.</p><p></p><p>Earlier on Yonye Island, they had been terrified. They could also see that this man in blue robes liked peace and quiet, so they didn't dare to disturb him again.</p><p></p><p>Moreover, this man in blue robes had even brought an attendant from Yonye Island, and it was an old man.</p><p></p><p>They were two beautiful elf maidens, who wouldn't be more pleasing to the eye than an old man...</p><p></p><p>Qing and Lin thought bitterly and soon disappeared.</p><p></p><p>Afterwards, Chen Pang and the other cultivators also carefully looked at the cultivators sitting there, then quickly entered the island.</p><p></p><p>"My lord, you..." the captain respectfully looked at Lu Changsheng.</p><p></p><p>"Go." </p><p></p><p>Lu Changsheng waved his hand with a smile, then disappeared with the old turtle at the bow of the ship.</p><p></p><p>"Respectfully seeing off my lord."</p><p></p><p>The captain hurriedly bowed deeply, and when he straightened up, his gaze turned to the depths of the island, murmuring:</p><p></p><p>"With my lord's powerful presence descending upon Tiantian Island, I don't know what he's going to do. I just hope the various forces on the island can open their eyes and not dig their own graves."</p><p></p><p>The captain had a vague premonition that Tiantian Island was about to change.</p><p></p><p>...</p><p></p><p>Tiantian Island was vast, like a whole continent.</p><p></p><p>At the edge of Tiantian Island, a man in blue robes was sitting cross-legged on a black turtle, leisurely flying through the sky.</p><p></p><p>Lu Changsheng took the wine gourd from his waist, took a sip, and his eyes looked down at the buildings below, where large and conspicuous flags with the names of various forces were erected.</p><p></p><p>Many of these areas had good geographical locations and abundant law energy, just as the captain had said. The good places for comprehension had all been forcibly occupied and monopolized by the major forces.</p><p></p><p>However, the law energy here was still a bit lacking in Lu Changsheng's eyes.</p><p></p><p>"Master, the old turtle has found that the closer you get to the center of Tiantian Island, the more abundant the law energy becomes."</p><p></p><p>The old turtle tilted its head and said.</p><p></p><p>So it was already clear that the strength of the forces was basically ranked by this, the closer to the center of Tiantian Island, the stronger the forces!</p><p></p><p>Lu Changsheng chuckled lightly, "Ordinary people can only comprehend one law, old turtle, how about you?"</p><p></p><p>The old turtle was silent for a moment, then replied, "Master, the law energy is very compatible with the old turtle. The old turtle has a premonition that as long as the conditions and time allow, the old turtle can comprehend ten ordinary laws, and five high-level laws."</p><p></p><p>"What about the supreme laws?" Lu Changsheng suddenly asked.</p><p></p><p>The old turtle smiled bitterly, "Master, the supreme laws... the old turtle can't say for sure... that thing, you know."</p><p></p><p>Although the old turtle was confident in its innate talents, it had not yet comprehended the laws, and for the supreme laws, it dared not make any promises to Lu Changsheng.</p><p></p><p>Lu Changsheng looked far into the depths of the island, closed his eyes and said:</p><p></p><p>"Accelerate, go directly to the best comprehension point in the center of the island, and I will help you then."</p><p></p><p>"Thank you, Master." The old turtle smiled awkwardly, "But Master, if the old turtle can't comprehend more than three supreme laws, you won't blame me, right?"</p><p></p><p>Lu Changsheng said indifferently, "If you can't comprehend more than three supreme laws, then you will sleep here forever."</p><p></p><p>The old turtle was immediately terrified. Comprehending one was already difficult, comprehending three, wouldn't that mean certain death?</p><p></p><p>The old turtle knew that Lu Changsheng never went back on his word, and the more it thought about it, the more it trembled.</p><p></p><p>Accompanying the lord is like accompanying a tiger!</p><p></p><p>Here is my translation of the Chinese excerpt:</p><p></p><p>Wow!</p><p></p><p>"What are you panicking about? Just go, I said I would help you. With me here, even a pig could comprehend a top-tier law. If you, this immortal turtle, can't even grasp three laws, don't you deserve to die?"</p><p></p><p>Lu Changsheng said meaningfully.</p><p></p><p>"I do!"</p><p></p><p>The old turtle understood, and so his spirits were lifted. He suddenly increased his speed and rushed deep into the island, disappearing in the blink of an eye.</p><p></p><p>...</p><p></p><p>At the central location of the island, the power of the laws could no longer be described as just dense, but thick!</p><p></p><p>This place was the forbidden zone of the entire Ascending Heaven Island!</p><p></p><p>The reason it was called a forbidden zone was that the forces entrenched here were at the peak of the sea of laws!!</p><p></p><p>These top-tier forces occupied the best resources to allow the geniuses of their sects or races to comprehend the laws, so that they could continue to grow stronger and stronger.</p><p></p><p>This was the essence of the strong getting stronger and the weak getting weaker.</p><p></p><p>The best resources are often in the hands of the strong. If you, the weak, don't have great fortune on your side, dreaming of defying the heavens is just nonsense!</p><p></p><p>Because the strong do not allow the weak to share the cake.</p><p></p><p>Just like the central position of the Ascending Heaven Island, apart from the large forces entrenched here, no one else is allowed to approach.</p><p></p><p>However, the peak forces occupying the central area are basically led by a high-level member guarding the place.</p><p></p><p>The main camps of these peak forces are naturally not located here.</p><p></p><p>The peak forces in the central area include the Sword God Sect, the Sky Bat Clan, the Nine Abyss Yellow Springs Palace, the Demon Subduing Valley, and the five great clans of Qin, Li, Wang, Yang, and Chu!</p><p></p><p>And they are the nine peak forces of the sea of laws!</p><p></p><p>For a crucial hub like the Ascending Heaven Island, the nine peak forces have naturally sent high-level members to occupy and guard the core area.</p><p></p><p>At the same time, outside the central area,</p><p></p><p>Lu Changsheng had already arrived riding the old turtle. They were isolated from the central area by the seven-colored barrier built by the nine forces.</p><p></p><p>As long as they crossed this seven-colored barrier, they would truly enter the central area.</p><p></p><p>"Master, I can feel that the laws inside are so dense that it's astonishing!"</p><p></p><p>The old turtle said excitedly. He couldn't help but look up at the sky, puzzled by how the power of the laws could be so dense here, and whether it was inexhaustible.</p><p></p><p>"Who dares to approach the central area?!!"</p><p></p><p>At this moment, disciples of the Sword God Sect guarding the area appeared, holding swords, a total of ten people, all coldly staring at Lu Changsheng and the old turtle.</p><p></p><p>They were somewhat surprised in their hearts, not understanding who the young man in blue was, and how he dared to approach this place alone?</p><p></p><p>Did he have a death wish?</p><p></p><p>In the three thousand law realms, who would dare to provoke the nine peak forces!</p><p></p><p>Lu Changsheng raised his eyebrows slightly, sweeping a glance at the ten people, and chuckled lightly, "What? A natural treasure trove should be shared by heaven and man. When did it become the exclusive possession of anyone?"</p><p></p><p>The Sword God Sect disciples paused, looking at each other in confusion, not understanding where this lunatic came from.</p><p></p><p>"Since you haven't crossed the line yet, I'll give you three breaths to get out of here! I'm in a good mood today and don't want to kill anyone," the leader of the Sword God Sect disciples said impatiently.</p><p></p><p>Lu Changsheng's mouth curled into a smile, and he suddenly pointed forward!!</p><p></p><p>"Boom!!!"</p><p></p><p>The huge seven-colored barrier of the central area instantly shattered!!</p><p></p><p>The central area immediately became chaotic!</p><p></p><p>All the flying insects and beasts were startled, and even the many cultivators guarding this area from the nine peak forces had their expressions change slightly, looking up in astonishment at the seven-colored barrier... that had been shattered to pieces!</p><p></p><p>At this moment, Lu Changsheng turned his head to look at the ten dumbfounded Sword God Sect disciples, then smiled and said,</p><p></p><p>"How coincidental, I'm also in a good mood today, and I'll give you three breaths to run as well. But let me make one thing clear, you won't be able to escape..."</p>

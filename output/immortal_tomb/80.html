        <h1>Chapter 80</h1>
        <div class="content">
            <p>Here is the full English translation of the Chinese excerpt:</p><p></p><p>"Crane, Crane Forest?" </p><p></p><p>Shen Jing Tao and the Grand Elder immediately saw the ancient Crane Forest hanging in the back, their faces filled with surprise.</p><p></p><p>With doubts, Shen Jing Tao probed the aura of the ancient Crane Forest, then was dumbfounded.</p><p></p><p>Mid-Nascent Soul stage?</p><p></p><p>What's going on?</p><p></p><p>Wasn't he just at the peak of the Golden Core stage before?</p><p></p><p>"Sir, the Crane Forest saw the Sect Elder and has already gone over there." </p><p></p><p>The stiff-faced Ancient Crane Forest walked over and respectfully greeted the bewildered Grand Elder.</p><p></p><p>Lu Changsheng nodded slightly.</p><p></p><p>Seeing this, the Ancient Crane Forest was pleasantly surprised and quickly went over after a salute.</p><p></p><p>Under the gaze of all present, he, being only at the Nascent Soul stage, could not withstand it, especially the strange looks from so many Tribulation Transcending and Deity Transformation cultivators.</p><p></p><p>"Crane Forest, weren't you at the Golden Core stage? Why did you come all this way, and what about the others, what's going on...?" </p><p></p><p>The Grand Elder hastily transmitted voice to ask when the Ancient Crane Forest arrived.</p><p></p><p>The Ancient Crane Forest's face stiffened as he said, "Grand Elder, I am now at the mid-Nascent Soul stage, while you are only at the initial stage, don't be so presumptuous."</p><p></p><p>"Haha, you little rascal, you're already mocking this old man, you can't just blow your own horn like that." The Grand Elder paused, the corner of his mouth twitching.</p><p></p><p>The Ancient Crane Forest was at the peak of the Golden Core stage just recently, and now he's telling him he's at the mid-Nascent Soul stage?? </p><p></p><p>The Grand Elder didn't even want to probe, because that was simply impossible!</p><p></p><p>The Ancient Crane Forest smiled mysteriously, his tiger-like body shaking, and suddenly a pressure unique to the Nascent Soul stage was emanating...</p><p></p><p>"Whew, you're serious about this?" The Grand Elder was dumbfounded: "What kind of spirit elixir did you take?"</p><p></p><p>The Ancient Crane Forest smugly snorted without explanation, but looked at Lu Changsheng and the others and said, "Grand Elder, do you still remember the離水帝國? He... is that gentleman."</p><p></p><p>Sure enough, the Grand Elder's attention was immediately diverted, and he looked at Lu Changsheng with a shaking gaze, understanding dawning.</p><p></p><p>So this is that senior who has reached Deity Transformation, going inside is understandable.</p><p></p><p>At some point, the place had gradually quieted down, </p><p></p><p>and in this quiet environment, the footsteps of Lu Changsheng's group were exceptionally clear.</p><p></p><p>Soon, they passed through the camp of the Tribulation Transcending True Lords like Shen Jing Tao and the Heavenly Wheel Merchant Clan Patriarch, to the amazement of all.</p><p></p><p>Straight towards the group of over 20 cultivators in the Tribulation Crossing camp...</p><p></p><p>This scene left everyone dumbfounded...</p><p></p><p>What does this mean?! </p><p></p><p>Are these people crazy, are they going to cause trouble at Elder Zhang Youdao's ascension ceremony?</p><p></p><p>Do they not know who is present here...?</p><p></p><p>"Fellow Daoists, please wait."</p><p></p><p>Finally, a Tribulation Crossing cultivator slowly stood up, his voice ringing out.</p><p></p><p>He was a middle-aged man, wearing a loose black robe, disheveled hair, an aura of demonic power swirling around him.</p><p></p><p>"He is the Patriarch of the Western Domain Demon Palace, Elder Duan Jiumo! His cultivation has already reached the mid-Tribulation Crossing stage, I heard he's about to break through to the late stage!"</p><p></p><p>"Yes, after Elder Zhang's ascension, Elder Duan Jiumo will likely take his place and carry the banner of our Western Domain."</p><p></p><p>"It's just a pity that he's a demonic cultivator, still lacking something..."</p><p></p><p>"Shh, are you trying to get yourself killed? How dare you say such things!"</p><p></p><p>"Ah, it's all thanks to Elder Zhang's Tribulation Crossing that we have the chance to see such peak experts!"</p><p></p><p>The crowd discussed animatedly, their gazes filled with reverence and awe.</p><p></p><p>Lu Changsheng's footsteps paused.</p><p></p><p>Seeing this, Chu Xiran and Old Turtle also stopped, but Old Turtle's gaze had become less friendly - his temper could be quite fiery at times.</p><p></p><p>Lu Changsheng turned his head, looking at Duan Jiumo, and smiled lightly. "What's the matter?"</p><p></p><p>Duan Jiumo glanced around, seeing that all eyes were on this place, so he cleared his throat and said solemnly,</p><p></p><p>"Fellow Daoist, this is the place for observing the Tribulation Crossing Ascension, where all the Tribulation Crossing cultivators from the four domains gather. I've never heard of you all before..."</p><p></p><p>The implication in his words was clear: "Do you have the qualifications to be here?"</p><p></p><p>And this was the thought of almost everyone present.</p><p></p><p>Lu Changsheng naturally understood this, but still smiled and asked, "So what are you trying to express?"</p><p></p><p>Seeing the other's calm smile and carefree manner, Duan Jiumo directly felt his prestige being trampled on!</p><p></p><p>The group of Tribulation Crossing cultivators had already probed Lu Changsheng's trio, but found nothing.</p><p></p><p>The Spiritual Dust Realm is just so vast, aside from Jiang Yuan,</p><p></p><p>Here is the full English translation of the Chinese excerpt:</p><p></p><p>Zhang Youdao, Qin Miaomiao, Liu Wusu, and the four of them could not think of anyone more powerful than themselves.</p><p></p><p>They wanted to conquer the world, but they never imagined the four corners of the immortal realms!</p><p></p><p>Quite inexplicably, Duan Jiude felt a bit of pressure, and he said sternly, "Of course, I want to try the martial prowess of my fellow Daoists. If your strength is not up to par, then..."</p><p></p><p>He was originally a demonic cultivator, and the ferocious aura he was emanating at this moment made countless cultivators present change color!</p><p></p><p>Old Turtle saw this and couldn't help himself, taking a step forward, wanting to teach him how to behave!</p><p></p><p>Lu Changsheng raised a hand, and Old Turtle's movement immediately paused, and then his heart grew excited. Good, the master intends to take action himself!</p><p></p><p>Even Chu Xiran's eyes lit up. She really wanted to witness this Dao companion Lu's methods, as she had never seen him take action during this period...</p><p></p><p>"What, are you afraid?" Seeing this, Duan Jiumo suddenly had an inkling, and then he directly bared his teeth in a cold smile.</p><p></p><p>Since he had an inkling, he was too lazy to pretend anymore, and he laid his cards on the table.</p><p></p><p>Tap, tap, tap...</p><p></p><p>Just as the crowd thought the young man in blue was going to back down, their pupils suddenly contracted.</p><p></p><p>They saw the young man in blue slowly walking towards Duan Jiumo with his hands behind his back.</p><p></p><p>Each step seemed to be treading on the hearts of the crowd.</p><p></p><p>What is he trying to do?</p><p></p><p>Lu Changsheng looked at the approaching Duan Jiumo and said mildly, "Of course, you can try your strength, but if I happen to use a bit too much force, you'll most likely die. Still want to try?"</p><p></p><p>Huh...</p><p></p><p>The young man in blue was smiling, but although the smile was gentle, the crowd did not feel any warmth from it.</p><p></p><p>At these words, even the crowd of Nascent Soul and Tribulation Transcendence cultivators changed color, staring at Lu Changsheng in disbelief.</p><p></p><p>How bold...</p><p></p><p>Hearing this, Duan Jiumo's heart trembled violently, and under this aura, he couldn't help but take a half-step back.</p><p></p><p>But very soon, his face flushed red with anger. Damn it, in front of so many people, he was actually intimidated!</p><p></p><p>This half-step back would definitely become the laughingstock of the cultivation world in the future!</p><p></p><p>The only option is... to kill this young man in blue!</p><p></p><p>"If I happen to use a bit too much force and you die? Are you joking?!" Duan Jiumo let out a fierce roar, his body surging with demonic qi. He couldn't hold back anymore, he had to strike directly!</p><p></p><p>With a simple hand seal, endless demonic qi surged up from Duan Jiumo as the center, filling the sky!</p><p></p><p>Various chilling demonic howls resounded!</p><p></p><p>Many of the cultivators present with lower cultivation bases had blood seeping from the corners of their mouths. They looked on in terror, truly Duan Jiumo was too terrifying. Just the preliminary casting was enough to affect so many of them!</p><p></p><p>The Tribulation Transcendence cultivators quickly set up a shielding formation in the sky, and the expressions of the crowd gradually calmed down.</p><p></p><p>"Demonic Technique, Mysterious Heaven Burial Annihilation Finger!" A bloodthirsty roar rang out, and Duan Jiumo unleashed his trump card as soon as he struck!</p><p></p><p>If he didn't instantly kill this arrogant young man today, he would have no face left in the cultivation world.</p><p></p><p>Rumbling...</p><p></p><p>Towering demonic qi rolled, forming a thousand-zhang-tall pitch-black giant finger in the void, with demonic qi swirling around it, and countless skeletal figures vaguely visible.</p><p></p><p>At this moment, the sky seemed to have been drenched in a vast amount of ink, pitch-black, chilling the soul.</p><p></p><p>"Go!" He roared!!!</p><p></p><p>Instantly, the pitch-black giant finger, exuding a terrifying pressure, swept down fiercely!</p><p></p><p>"Hahaha! Don't even think about evading, my Mysterious Heaven Burial Annihilation Finger has already locked onto you. Even if you flee to the ends of the earth, you can't escape!" Duan Jiumo kept his hand seal, laughing madly.</p><p></p><p>This scene made many of the Tribulation Transcendence cultivators' expressions extremely grave.</p><p></p><p>Among them, many who wanted to withstand Duan Jiumo's attack would have to pay a heavy price, and there was a high chance they would perish...</p><p></p><p>At this moment, Lu Changsheng casually waved his sleeve, without any visible movement.</p><p></p><p>The pitch-black giant finger then mysteriously froze in midair!</p><p></p><p>It could not advance an inch!</p><p></p><p>"..." The crowd stared at the pitch-black giant finger suspended in the air, their pupils contracting sharply.</p><p></p><p>"Impossible!!!" Duan Jiumo was stunned for a moment, then let out a shrill scream, his eyes bulging, looking like a madman!</p><p></p><p>"Since you've tried, then die." Lu Changsheng said indifferently, without any visible action.</p><p></p><p>Duan Jiumo, under the horrified and desperate gaze of the crowd, collapsed and scattered like a sand figure blown by the wind... disappearing...</p><p></p><p>Outside the Carefree Pavilion, there was a deathly silence, like countless statues.</p><p></p><p>Only the pitch-black giant finger suspended in the air, and soon, the demonic qi began to flicker like flames.</p><p></p><p>In no time, it also dissipated.</p>

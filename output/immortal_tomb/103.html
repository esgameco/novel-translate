        <h1>Chapter 103</h1>
        <div class="content">
            <p>Here is the full English translation of the Chinese excerpt:</p><p></p><p>"Teacher, Shifu, you have repelled the Thunderbolt Tribulation!!" </p><p></p><p>Tongxin and Lin Dong were shocked, their faces turning deathly pale as they looked at Gu Helin.</p><p></p><p>When did the Shifu become so fierce?</p><p></p><p>Gu Helin snapped out of it, his old face flushing red, as he coughed dryly, "You two brats, how dare you make fun of your teacher, didn't you hear the name I just called out?!"</p><p></p><p>"Oh, so it was the Shifu, in that case it's fine, I was just saying, Shifu really scared me and Lin Dong just now."</p><p></p><p>Tongxin and Lin Dong nodded understandingly, it seems the dream of becoming a dragon disciple is no longer possible.</p><p></p><p>"Big Sword Brother, let's go."</p><p></p><p>Afterwards, Tongxin and Lin Dong dragged the bewildered Chen Dada and flew away.</p><p></p><p>Gu Helin's mouth twitched slightly,</p><p></p><p>These two brats seem to have a rebellious streak...</p><p></p><p>...</p><p></p><p>In the Southern Immortal Realm, on the Fuyao Immortal Island, in the Langtian Domain.</p><p></p><p>Within the Chu Clan of Immortals, Chu Lang had wanted to host a banquet but was rejected by Lu Changsheng.</p><p></p><p>He then personally brought Lu Changsheng to the most prosperous guest hall of the clan and then took his leave.</p><p></p><p>In the main hall.</p><p></p><p>"Elders, you can all go rest now, you've worked hard today," Chu Lang said with a smile.</p><p></p><p>"Yes, Clan Leader, then we shall take our leave." </p><p></p><p>The elders bowed and left the hall, Chu Xiruo also followed them out.</p><p></p><p>"Xiruo, stay behind," Chu Lang suddenly said.</p><p></p><p>Chu Xiruo's steps paused, and she turned around and walked back, bowing and saying, "Father, what does Xiruo's father summon her for?"</p><p></p><p>Chu Lang nodded approvingly, after going through the Sand City, this girl finally started calling him father.</p><p></p><p>It seems that the destruction of the Eternal Grand Sect by the Senior was truly a good thing.</p><p></p><p>"Xiruo, you and that Zhang Youdao already knew that the Eternal Grand Sect was destroyed by the Senior, right?" Chu Lang asked with a flickering gaze.</p><p></p><p>Chu Xiruo's eyes flashed, knowing that during the day in the Sand City, after the Immortal Emperor Changsheng appeared, her and Zhang Youdao's behavior was too strange, and someone perceptive could have guessed the clues.</p><p></p><p>So she replied in a low voice, "Yes, so is Father blaming Xiruo for hiding the truth from the clan even when they were facing life and death?"</p><p></p><p>Chu Lang paused, waving his hand and said, "There must be a reason for what happened, I don't blame you. Today, I just want to ask one thing, why?"</p><p></p><p>Chu Xiruo lowered her head and fell silent.</p><p></p><p>Chu Lang didn't rush her, just quietly watching her.</p><p></p><p>Soon, Chu Xiruo raised her head, a trace of reverence flashing in her eyes, and said,</p><p></p><p>"Father, I can only tell you one thing."</p><p></p><p>"The Senior... in the Immortal Realm, he can turn the clouds with a wave of his hand."</p><p></p><p>Chu Lang's pupils shrank, and he abruptly stood up, exclaiming in shock, "Could the Senior be the Primordial Immortal Lord?!"</p><p></p><p>Chu Xiruo pursed her lips, not answering again.</p><p></p><p>She didn't blame Chu Lang, because the Chu Clan of Immortals was located in the remote Langtian Domain, where there wasn't even a Great Immortal Sage, let alone the Primordial Immortal Lord.</p><p></p><p>So the Primordial Immortal Lord was probably the limit of what Chu Lang could imagine...</p><p></p><p>Being in a remote place, one's vision is just like that, there's no helping it.</p><p></p><p>Chu Xiruo asked herself, if it were her, in the absence of knowledge, she would have at most thought of the Primordial Immortal Lord, not daring to even think of the Immortal King, let alone connecting the Senior to the disappeared for a million years Immortal Emperor Changsheng.</p><p></p><p>"Ah! Xiruo, in the eyes of the Senior, I'm probably just..."</p><p></p><p>Here is the full English translation of the Chinese excerpt:</p><p></p><p>"Ah, this person has no sense of etiquette! What are we to do!" </p><p></p><p>At this time, Chu Lang's expression was gloomy, and he paced back and forth, clenching his fists. It was evident that he was somewhat uneasy.</p><p></p><p>"What, what's wrong?" Chu Xi was a bit confused.</p><p></p><p>Chu Lang stopped in his tracks and said in a hoarse voice, "I finally understand why you didn't reveal the truth before, as you said, the senior is such a supreme immortal lord, capable of commanding the clouds and the rain. You were right not to speak of it."</p><p></p><p>"It's just... is it that I wasn't respectful enough to the senior during the day? I'm a bit afraid now, no wonder, no wonder when I held a banquet for the senior during the day, he refused, he must have been unhappy! Oh no, oh no..."</p><p></p><p>Chu Lang stumbled and fell back into the seat, his face pale.</p><p></p><p>A supreme immortal lord, he had to be afraid of him. If the senior was displeased, with just a thought, his Chu Clan could be torn apart.</p><p></p><p>A supreme immortal lord, after all!</p><p></p><p>Chu Xi: "..."</p><p></p><p>Chu Xi was speechless, she didn't expect her father to be so dramatic.</p><p></p><p>She suspected that if he knew the true identity of the so-called "supreme immortal lord", he might just be scared to death.</p><p></p><p>"Father, you worry too much. Given the senior's status, he wouldn't bother with someone as insignificant as you." Chu Xi comforted.</p><p></p><p>She suddenly thought of the old turtle, and then said, "However, the senior's old servant, the Turtle Senior, might be more likely to hold a grudge. As the servant of the senior, his strength must also be extraordinary. Father, you'd better be careful in serving him."</p><p></p><p>To become the servant of an immortal emperor, it couldn't be simple!</p><p></p><p>Chu Xi could figure it out just by using her common sense.</p><p></p><p>Seeing Chu Lang sitting in a daze, Chu Xi no longer paid attention to him and left the hall.</p><p></p><p>Before leaving, she said meaningfully, "It seems the senior likes to drink wine."</p><p></p><p>Chu Lang snapped out of his daze, shaking his head.</p><p></p><p>"Ah, the Inspection Palace will surely come again. With a supreme immortal lord here, there's nothing to fear. I must curry favor with him properly."</p><p></p><p>Drinking wine, great.</p><p></p><p>He had saved up some fine wines, which he had been reluctant to drink before, but now they would finally come in handy.</p><p></p><p>Although it pained his heart, compared to the safety of the clan, what were a few bottles of wine?</p><p></p><p>Ah, but wait, Xiaoyu did say the senior's servant might be petty-minded, but she only mentioned the senior liking wine, not what his servant might like. This could be troublesome.</p><p></p><p>In the void,</p><p></p><p>"Lord Tianyuan, the Langtian Domain is just ahead, but due to its remote location, the teleportation array has not yet been constructed there. We will have to go there ourselves next."</p><p></p><p>The Inspection Commissioner bowed behind Zhao Tianyuan.</p><p></p><p>Zhao Tianyuan's expression was blank, his gaze fixed on the direction of the Langtian Domain. Although they would arrive soon, he was already somewhat impatient!</p><p></p><p>"Once we reach the Langtian Domain, you two are to go and inquire quickly. As soon as you find the culprit, report to me immediately." Zhao Tianyuan said calmly.</p><p></p><p>"Yes." The two Inspection Commissioners bowed in acknowledgment.</p><p></p><p>"Also," Zhao Tianyuan closed his eyes, a look of grief appearing on his face, "You must find Ling's body and bring it safely before me. After the matter is resolved, I will take the remains back for my father to see one last time... If you fail to bring it back, you two might as well not return."</p><p></p><p>"Lord Tianyuan, rest assured!" The two Inspection Commissioners exchanged a glance, resolute in their promise.</p><p></p><p>Finding a body, that's easy enough.</p><p></p><p>"Mm." Seeing this, Zhao Tianyuan nodded, a ruthless killing intent flashing in his eyes as he growled, "Go! The one who killed Ling, I will tear them to shreds, scatter their soul, so that they can never reincarnate!"</p>

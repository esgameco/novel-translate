        <h1>Chapter 550</h1>
        <div class="content">
            <p>Here is the full English translation of the Chinese excerpt:</p><p></p><p>The Mansion of the Lord of the Town.</p><p></p><p>At night, Cao Boyu's consciousness gradually returned, and he instinctively grasped his hand, only to find his palm empty.</p><p></p><p>He suddenly opened his eyes and sat up from the bed: "The fruit! My fruit!!"</p><p></p><p>This startled Cao Yudong, who was keeping him company by the bedside. Cao Yudong quickly handed the fruit over, saying excitedly, "Boyu, don't be anxious, the fruit is here."</p><p></p><p>Cao Boyu quickly took it, holding it tightly in his palms, his eyes reddening as he sobbed, "Father, the teacher has finally accepted me."</p><p></p><p>"I already know, and I'm very pleased, Boyu, you've grown up."</p><p></p><p>Cao Yudong affectionately ruffled Cao Boyu's hair, then sighed, "It wasn't easy... I had already given up back then, but who would have thought that you, my child..."</p><p></p><p>Cao Boyu spoke softly, "Father, the teacher has let me sit in and listen, but if I don't perform well, I may still be driven out."</p><p></p><p>"No matter, Boyu, just do your best. As for Master Lu, when he has time, I'll invite him to the mansion for a meal," Cao Yudong said with a smile.</p><p></p><p>Then Cao Yudong got up, "Boyu, you should rest well. The doctor has already applied medicine to your knee, and you'll recover by tomorrow. I'll take you to study then."</p><p></p><p>"Yes, Father, don't worry. This opportunity is hard-won, I will work hard and be obedient!" Cao Boyu promised.</p><p></p><p>"Haha, good! You don't need to promise me, this opportunity is one you've fought for yourself. As long as you can live up to it," Cao Yudong said, turning and leaving the room.</p><p></p><p>...</p><p></p><p>And so another day passed, and it was now two days later!</p><p></p><p>It was the day Yin Quan and Mei Cangwu were preparing to attack the Tianwu Sect!</p><p></p><p>At the same time, the two elders sent by the Tianwu Sect were gradually approaching Jixiang Town!</p><p></p><p>"Hmm? Those two are... the Second Elder and Third Elder of the Tianwu Sect?" </p><p></p><p>In a remote wilderness far from Jixiang Town, an old man hiding his aura in the trees, Jiang Yanfeng, the Grand Elder of the Daoyan Sect, narrowed his eyes as he focused on the two figures flying towards Jixiang Town.</p><p></p><p>After sending the message to his sect, Jiang Yanfeng had been hiding here, waiting for Yin Quan's instructions. But after several days, there was still no movement.</p><p></p><p>After hesitating, Jiang Yanfeng decided to continue waiting. If something happened in Jixiang Town, he could be the first to know.</p><p></p><p>Jiang Yanfeng slightly pondered, then silently headed towards Jixiang Town as well. He wanted to see what the Second and Third Elders of the Tianwu Sect were coming here for. Could it be about the Earth Vein?</p><p></p><p>But according to reason, the two Earth Veins had long been divided up by the Tianwu Sect and the other sects.</p><p></p><p>...</p><p></p><p>At the same time!</p><p></p><p>The Daoyan Sect had already gathered, from the elders to the disciples, and their expressions were extremely solemn, even panicked!</p><p></p><p>They knew that today was the day they would attack the Tianwu Sect!</p><p></p><p>At the forefront, Yin Quan stood there, sweeping his gaze over the vast crowd of Daoyan Sect disciples, and spoke solemnly:</p><p></p><p>"I'm sure you all know, that's right, today we will attack the Tianwu Sect!"</p><p></p><p>"Our Sect Master knows that some of you are anxious, flustered, and even fearful!"</p><p></p><p>"But you must know one thing - the Fifth Elder is dead! Killed by the Tianwu Sect and the other sects working together!"</p><p></p><p>"This means something, and I'm sure you all understand - it represents that the Tianwu Sect has already stopped hiding and is preparing to eliminate us Daoyan Sect!"</p><p></p><p>"Of course, we can't just wait to die. Rather than wait for the Tianwu Sect to attack, it's better to strike first and catch them off guard!!"</p><p></p><p>"Don't worry, our Sect Master has already collaborated with the Northern Star Academy to formulate a plan. This time, the Tianwu Sect will definitely reap the consequences of their evil deeds and disappear forever from the Star Luo Empire!"</p><p></p><p>"The Tianwu Sect is merciless, so we can't be blamed for being unrighteous. As the saying goes, crisis and opportunity coexist. This time, for our Daoyan Sect, it is also a heaven-sent opportunity! As long as we overthrow the Tianwu Sect, then our Daoyan Sect will be the number one martial arts sect in Star Luo!"</p><p></p><p>The countless disciples suddenly felt their anxious and uneasy hearts calm down, because there was a key piece of information in the Sect Master's words.</p><p></p><p>Collaborated with the Northern Star Academy to formulate a plan?</p><p></p><p>This means...</p><p></p><p>Here is the full English translation of the Chinese excerpt:</p><p></p><p>"Does this mean that the North Star Academy has also gotten involved this time?"</p><p></p><p>"With the Yan Sect and the North Star Academy, they indeed have the strength to fight against the Tianwu Sect!"</p><p></p><p>Seeing that his disciples were confident, Yin Quan nodded in satisfaction.</p><p></p><p>At this moment, the communication jade talisman heated up, and he quickly took it out. Mei Cangwu's voice came through: "Sect Master Yin, you can set out now. We are also about to arrive at the Tianwu Sect. We'll contact you with the jade talisman when we get there."</p><p></p><p>Yin Quan was delighted, put away the jade talisman, and shouted, "Set out to the Tianwu Sect!"</p><p></p><p>...</p><p></p><p>Jixiang Town.</p><p></p><p>As soon as the two Tianwu Sect Elders arrived, they went to ask the passersby, but one after another, they shook their heads in panic and ran away.</p><p></p><p>"Hehe, it seems that the powerful expert's deterrence is quite strong."</p><p></p><p>The Second Elder sneered.</p><p></p><p>The Third Elder, Qian Xuan, shook his head and looked around, "Second Elder, this town is not that big. We should be able to find him quickly."</p><p></p><p>"Third Elder, there's no need to be so troublesome. Just find a passerby and continue to ask. If they still can't answer, then we'll make an example of them to warn the others."</p><p></p><p>The Second Elder finished speaking and suddenly glared at an old lady, shouting, "You, come here!"</p><p></p><p>At this shout, the entire street fell silent.</p><p></p><p>The old lady trembled in fear, her legs weak as she walked up to the Second Elder. "G-great one, you called for me..."</p><p></p><p>The Second Elder directly asked, "I am Elder Wang Sao of the Tianwu Sect's Outer Court. The steward Song Ren was killed in your Jixiang Town! Tell me, where is the powerful expert who killed them?"</p><p></p><p>The townspeople were shocked, their scalps tingling with fear!</p><p></p><p>The Elder Wang Sao and Steward Song Ren from the other day had... died??</p><p></p><p>Everyone immediately thought of Mr. Lu.</p><p></p><p>But didn't Mr. Lu let them go?</p><p></p><p>This was what they had seen with their own eyes!</p><p></p><p>It must be a misunderstanding! There must be a misunderstanding!</p><p></p><p>Mr. Lu, the gentle and kind schoolteacher, although his strength and background were mysterious, he would definitely not randomly kill people!</p><p></p><p>At the same time, in the classroom of the Longevity Academy.</p><p></p><p>"Mr. Lu, should we let Little Zui...?"</p><p></p><p>Zui Qiancheng paused the lecture and asked.</p><p></p><p>Sitting there, Lu Changsheng stood up, yawned, and said, "You continue teaching the students. I'm bored, so I'll go take a look at what's going on."</p><p></p><p>With that, he disappeared through the wall.</p><p></p><p>The students, including Han Yue, swallowed hard. Although they already knew that their teacher was extraordinary, seeing him pass through the wall so effortlessly was still incredibly impressive.</p><p></p><p>Especially Cao Boyu, who had been listening by the window, was completely stunned!</p><p></p><p>He was right to persist in wanting to join the Longevity Academy. Their teacher was truly powerful, just very low-key.</p><p></p><p>And even the assistant teacher, Old Xu... Ah, if they didn't come, they wouldn't know. But now that they've come, it's a shock - he's been hiding too deeply.</p><p></p><p>Cao Boyu's gaze was resolute. He must become the teacher's formal student. This was an incredible opportunity!</p><p></p><p>Huh, wait a minute?</p><p></p><p>The students suddenly realized something.</p><p></p><p>Just now, didn't Old Xu call himself "Little Zui"? What's this "Little Zui"?</p><p></p><p>The students were puzzled, still pondering, when Zui Qiancheng suddenly brought down the ruler on the lectern with a "crack" sound. "Stop daydreaming, continue the lesson!"</p><p></p><p>...</p><p></p><p>On the street, the old lady's face was deathly pale, hesitant to speak.</p><p></p><p>The Second Elder lost his patience, his face gloomy, and he suddenly reached out to grab the old lady's throat. "You lowly commoner, you don't want to drink, so you'll have to drink the punishment!"</p><p></p><p>The old lady was so frightened that she crouched down.</p><p></p><p>But just then, the Second Elder's outstretched hand froze in place. He was shocked for a moment, then became terrified, as he had lost control of his own body!</p><p></p><p>Next to him, Qian Xuan saw this and his expression turned suspicious, but soon his eyes narrowed.</p><p></p><p>Qian Xuan also felt his body becoming petrified, unable to move.</p><p></p><p>How strange! Extremely strange!!</p><p></p><p>Lu Changsheng had appeared without them noticing. He gently helped the dazed old lady up and smiled. "Old lady, don't be afraid. These two scoundrels were bullying you. Shall we teach them a lesson together?"</p>

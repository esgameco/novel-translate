        <h1>Chapter 106</h1>
        <div class="content">
            <p>Here is the full English translation of the Chinese excerpt:</p><p></p><p>The distant Ye Xiao glared at Huan Liuli impatiently, and Huan Liuli shrank her neck and immediately wiped the saliva from the corner of her mouth.</p><p></p><p>"Uh, it's nothing, master, don't be angry, I'll start the fire right away."</p><p></p><p>Half an hour later, by the campfire, Ye Xiao sat aside as Huan Liuli handed him the first skewered snake meat.</p><p></p><p>"Master, please try it first."</p><p></p><p>Ye Xiao was in no hurry to enjoy it. He took the snake meat and dipped it in the various condiments around.</p><p></p><p>"High-end barbecue often uses fresh ingredients. If conditions permit, you must add pepper and cumin. If the flavor is light, just sprinkle some salt. If the flavor is strong, chili powder is also needed to assist."</p><p></p><p>"This way, a fragrant, tender, salty and spicy barbecue can be truly completed."</p><p></p><p>"Gulp."</p><p></p><p>Huan Liuli swallowed her saliva hard.</p><p></p><p>"The master is right."</p><p></p><p>Ye Xiao took a bite and his eyes lit up.</p><p></p><p>"Good snake meat! Unexpectedly, the skin and flesh of the Black Scale Snake are so tough, but the freshness and deliciousness far exceed my imagination.</p><p></p><p>It's as if there's a feeling of tenderized beef slices, and also like adding mutton fat.</p><p></p><p>Biting into it, the surface is crispy, the fat bursts out, giving a very satisfying feeling.</p><p></p><p>The inside is soft and delicate, melting without chewing.</p><p></p><p>Perfect!"</p><p></p><p>Hearing Ye Xiao's praise, Huan Liuli immediately took out a skewer and tasted it herself.</p><p></p><p>Because she ate too hastily without using spiritual energy to protect herself, she screamed in pain and hopped around.</p><p></p><p>Ye Xiao shook his head and smiled silently.</p><p></p><p>He opened a beer and continued to eat the barbecue, but in his mind, he was thinking about something.</p><p></p><p>Previously, Ye Xiao had also eaten some star beast barbecue, and he found that except for a few rare star beasts whose meat was a bit rough, the vast majority of star beasts had very good texture.</p><p></p><p>And as his cultivation became deeper, their meat became even more tender and delicious.</p><p></p><p>But the Black Scale Snake, which was only at the Innate Fourth Grade, already had such a good taste. He wondered what the flavor of the Divine Ancestor-level Aer King would be like.</p><p></p><p>There was another thing.</p><p></p><p>This Black Scale Snake meat is so delicious, if it's all eaten up at once, it seems a bit of a waste.</p><p></p><p>It would be better to build a storage room in the basement of the house to store the snake meat. If it runs out, he can use the Dawn Star Technique or the Replenish the Heavens Technique to help it recover some meat.</p><p></p><p>After all, the consumption is just the spiritual energy of heaven and earth, while the recovery is real meat.</p><p></p><p>In the future, if the meat of the Aer King or other star beasts is even more delicious, he can also use this method to store them.</p><p></p><p>After eating and drinking his fill, it was time to get down to business.</p><p></p><p>Ye Xiao instructed Huan Liuri to dig a deep pit underground, and tomorrow he would purchase some construction materials with preservation formations to build an underground storage room for storing food.</p><p></p><p>He himself then entered the room and began to refine armor.</p><p></p><p>He had just healed the bug through Karmic Healing and obtained about hundreds of snake skins.</p><p></p><p>These hundreds of Black Scale Snake skins, except for the one he shed himself which was Innate Third Grade, the rest were all Innate Fourth Grade.</p><p></p><p>Hundreds of Innate Fourth Grade snake skins, this is such an astonishing number! It's equivalent to slaying hundreds of Innate Fourth Grade grand masters.</p><p></p><p>This is no less than the huge amount of star beast materials obtained from a major battle on the Star Battlefield.</p><p></p><p>Ye Xiao brought these Black Scale Snake...</p><p></p><p>Here is the full English translation of the excerpt from the Chinese novel:</p><p></p><p>After peeling off the snake skin, he began to forge the armor.</p><p></p><p>With divine craftsmanship in motion, he started to refine the elements within these snake skins.</p><p></p><p>In fact, for ordinary forgers, they can only forge one piece of armor from a single snake skin. To refine so many snake skins into a single piece of armor is extremely difficult.</p><p></p><p>It requires not only the experience and techniques of forging, but also the power of cultivation methods.</p><p></p><p>Only the top-tier cultivation methods possess the ability to refine so many snake skins into a single piece of armor.</p><p></p><p>Of course, even with divine craftsmanship, it is not guaranteed to be successful 100% of the time. Ye Xiao was lucky to have a method to continuously peel the skins from the same black-scaled snake.</p><p></p><p>Their genes were completely identical.</p><p></p><p>This is different from forging a flying dagger or a fine iron longsword, as the materials are extremely precious. Ye Xiao spent a full two days and nights before successfully forging this piece of armor on the morning of the third day.</p><p></p><p>Though called armor, it actually looks more like a normal black leather outfit. </p><p></p><p>Its design is similar to a leather jacket and black casual jeans. When worn, it does not make the wearer feel out of the ordinary. Only from an extremely precise angle can one see the scale-like patterns on it, revealing a touch of mystery.</p><p></p><p>Even those with extremely high strength may not necessarily be able to discern the secrets of this armor.</p><p></p><p>This is just the external benefit. Looking at its practicality, Ye Xiao surprisingly found that it can self-absorb spiritual energy and has a certain degree of self-defense awareness.</p><p></p><p>This is beyond Ye Xiao's expectations.</p><p></p><p>The reason why Sect Master-level weapons and armor can surpass ordinary and extraordinary-level ones is that in addition to being able to infuse them with spiritual energy, they can also infuse them with spiritual power.</p><p></p><p>Just like one can add spiritual power to their techniques to give them a self-guiding effect.</p><p></p><p>Sect Master-level weapons or armor, after being infused with spiritual power, can attack or defend themselves within the range of the sustained spiritual power.</p><p></p><p>The armor forged by Ye Xiao using the black-scaled snake skin has already reached the level of being able to self-defend, having its own spiritual power awareness. Isn't this even higher than Sect Master-level? Could it be considered an Emperor's Weapon? An Emperor's Armor!</p><p></p><p>It seems that the armor forged from hundreds of Saint-Emperor Realm snake skins is indeed extraordinary.</p><p></p><p>Thinking of this, Ye Xiao began to test the strength of this armor.</p><p></p><p>He placed the armor on the ground and condensed a Heavenly Sword Qi between his fingers, directly slashing it.</p><p></p><p>Sizzle! Sparks flew out, but there was only a faint scratch on the armor, almost invisible to the naked eye.</p><p></p><p>Ye Xiao was overjoyed.</p><p></p><p>"Good armor!"</p><p></p><p>Given that he can attack beyond his realm, his cultivation method is very powerful. Although his actual cultivation is only at the Saint-Emperor Realm, the attack power he can release has the confidence to reach the Deity Monarch Realm, about Saint-Emperor Realm Seven!</p><p></p><p>But even Deity Monarchs cannot break through the defense of this armor, showing how powerful it is.</p><p></p><p>Soon, the armor began to self-absorb spiritual energy and repair the scratch.</p><p></p><p>Weapons reaching above Sect Master-level already possess the ability of self-repair, but the repair time of Sect Master-level weapons has certain limitations when they are damaged.</p><p></p><p>Yet this armor's repair time is very short.</p><p></p><p>Excellent, this is a considerable gain.</p><p></p><p>Ye Xiao immediately wore the armor on his body.</p><p></p><p>Three more, please vote.</p><p></p><p>(This chapter is complete)</p>

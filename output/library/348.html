        <h1>Chapter 348</h1>
        <div class="content">
            <p>Here is the full English translation of the Chinese excerpt:</p><p></p><p>Next came the third trial.</p><p></p><p>After passing through the sea of fire, accompanied by a shower of flowers and a fragrant scent, a group of gracefully built women appeared ahead.</p><p></p><p>They danced and sang, alluring and charming.</p><p></p><p>Although neither Qinglong nor the Sage Emperor were lecherous, at this moment, they couldn't help but feel their body temperatures rise.</p><p></p><p>"Senior Sage Emperor, what is this? Is it an illusion?" </p><p></p><p>The Sage Emperor shook his head. Although his face was flushed, his gaze remained calm and resolute:</p><p></p><p>"This is not just an illusion, there are also some toxins involved. The combination of illusion and toxin will greatly weaken and constrain both our spiritual and physical strength.</p><p></p><p>Even though we have reached the Emperor Realm, we still cannot easily resist these things."</p><p></p><p>Qinglong was shocked.</p><p></p><p>Indeed, this was something set up by the ancestors of the human race. A small illusion could contain so much profundity that even mighty Emperors could not break through. Such methods were truly earth-shattering! </p><p></p><p>But at this moment, a beam of sword light suddenly shot out from beside him.</p><p></p><p>Boom! The sword beam flashed, instantly filling the entire space with a white glow.</p><p></p><p>After the white light dissipated, all the illusions disappeared, revealing only a corridor.</p><p></p><p>Qinglong and the Sage Emperor were both startled, looking towards Ye Xiao, who was slowly lowering his hand. His expression remained as calm as before.</p><p></p><p>This made their hearts tremble again.</p><p></p><p>What a terrifying state of mind! Facing the ancestors' combined illusion and poison trial, Ye Xiao remained unflustered and unperturbed! </p><p></p><p>No wonder he could rise to this level in such a short time.</p><p></p><p>A genius! He truly deserved to be called a genius!</p><p></p><p>"Let's go," Ye Xiao said indifferently, striding forward. Qinglong and the Sage Emperor exchanged a glance and immediately followed.</p><p></p><p>The subsequent trials were also quite difficult and had their own unique characteristics. </p><p></p><p>But for Ye Xiao, he easily resolved them all one by one.</p><p></p><p>Qinglong and the Sage Emperor went from being shocked to numb, and eventually became completely accustomed to it.</p><p></p><p>They had even determined in their hearts that Ye Xiao was the only one in thousands of years who could witness the presence of the ancestors.</p><p></p><p>Finally, the three of them passed through all the trials and arrived in a secret chamber.</p><p></p><p>Seeing the numerous elixirs on the ground, the Sage Emperor was overjoyed.</p><p></p><p>He immediately walked up and picked them up, examining them with a delighted expression.</p><p></p><p>"These are Emperor Elixirs! All the elixirs here are Emperor Elixirs! Wonderful! This must be what our human race's ancestors left behind."</p><p></p><p>He and Qinglong also had access to Emperor Elixirs in their daily lives, as the powerful forces behind them would provide abundant resources for their cultivation.</p><p></p><p>However, their abundant resources were still limited - they could only have a maximum of two Emperor Elixirs per month, which was already the limit.</p><p></p><p>But looking at the hundreds of Emperor Elixirs here, they had truly hit the jackpot this time and gained a lot.</p><p></p><p>Qinglong also had a joyful expression. Even though he was not particularly interested in material things, he could not ignore the value of Emperor Elixirs.</p><p></p><p>Among the three, only Ye Xiao remained calm, looking at the final door of the secret chamber.</p><p></p><p>Those Emperor Elixirs were no more attractive to him than the super-beast blood and flesh he normally consumed.</p><p></p><p>What lay behind that door was most likely the consciousness of Ancestor Xuanyuan.</p><p></p><p>He walked up and used the Taixuan Tiangong to probe, but there was no response. He then dripped a drop of his own blood.</p><p></p><p>The next moment, a line of small characters slowly appeared on the seal:</p><p></p><p>"Only those who have not touched the elixirs may enter."</p><p></p><p>Seeing these words, Qinglong and the Sage Emperor instantly turned to stone.</p><p></p><p>The elixirs in this secret chamber were actually part of the trial? Was this some kind of joke? They had traded a watermelon for a few sesame seeds.</p><p></p><p>"Let me try to see if I can go in," Qinglong took a deep breath, still feeling a bit unwilling.</p><p></p><p>They had come this far with Ye Xiao's help, and now they were stopped just because of a few elixirs. He was truly not satisfied.</p><p></p><p>Just as he was about to step forward, a destructive power suddenly erupted, rushing towards Qinglong's face. "Damned wretch, seeking death!"</p><p></p><p>If this power had hit Qinglong, it would have taken half his life in an instant.</p><p></p><p>Qinglong's face turned deathly pale.</p><p></p><p>However, Ye Xiao was quick to react. Using his Shengshu-level Claw Technique Duanxinghang, he grabbed Qinglong's shoulder and pulled him back.</p><p></p><p>At the same time, he activated the Luoshen Palm, colliding with the attacking force.</p><p></p><p>Boom! A violent explosion accompanied by a deafening sound, and the savage power erupted wildly throughout the secret chamber and even the entire tomb.</p><p></p><p>Ye Xiao deployed his defensive barrier to protect Qinglong and the Sage Emperor, preventing them from being crushed.</p><p></p><p>Otherwise, they might have been severely injured or even reduced to ashes by the shockwave.</p><p></p><p>After the...</p><p></p><p>Here is the full English translation of the Chinese excerpt:</p><p></p><p>The turbulence passed, and both of them couldn't help but shudder.</p><p></p><p>That previous move was simply earth-shattering for the two of them. One could only imagine how powerful the attack was.</p><p></p><p>Unexpectedly, Ye Xiao remained completely unmoved, and even saved the two of them.</p><p></p><p>If the two of them weren't already somewhat numb to Ye Xiao's strength, this would have shocked them for a long time.</p><p></p><p>Ye Xiao slowly withdrew his defensive shield.</p><p></p><p>"It seems you two can only go this far. The final seal is terrifyingly strong, and even I have no way to break it open."</p><p></p><p>The two of them nodded, although they were deeply disappointed. But they had to admit that only Ye Xiao was worthy of seeing the Xuanyuan Ancestor.</p><p></p><p>Ye Xiao asked the two to wait outside, and then he took a deep breath and stepped into the room where the Ancestor's self-consciousness was preserved.</p><p></p><p>This place was actually a vast hall, empty and devoid of any people.</p><p></p><p>Ye Xiao walked a few steps in the hall and released his spiritual power, but still felt nothing.</p><p></p><p>He pondered for a moment, then spoke:</p><p></p><p>"Ye Xiao, descendant of Xuanyuan, has come to pay respects to the Ancestor."</p><p></p><p>In the next moment, several figures emerged from the walls of the palace, each emanating a faint golden glow.</p><p></p><p>"Five thousand years! It's been five thousand years! Among our descendants, finally one has been able to come in."</p><p></p><p>"Rare, so rare! To have reached the peak of the Emperor Realm at just twenty-three years old, haha, child, you are the pride of our clan."</p><p></p><p>Ye Xiao was silent for a moment, then couldn't help but ask:</p><p></p><p>"Ancestor, is it not a single person, but a group of people?"</p><p></p><p>A few of the figures chuckled.</p><p></p><p>"Silly child, how can one person give birth to children? It takes a group of people to propagate so many descendants across the Nine Realms."</p><p></p><p>"This young lad is quite amusing in his speech."</p><p></p><p>"This child is only twenty-three years old, he may not even have that yet, so not knowing is understandable."</p><p></p><p>"Twenty-three is not that young, he can already have children. We were only seventeen back then."</p><p></p><p>"Shut up, you old fart! Do you think everyone is like you? For him to have reached the peak of the Emperor Realm at twenty-three, in the entire Xuanyuan Clan, he is one of the rare few.</p><p></p><p>Do you dare to compare yourself to him?"</p><p></p><p>The corner of Ye Xiao's mouth twitched involuntarily.</p><p></p><p>He then cleared his throat and said:</p><p></p><p>"Descendant of Xuanyuan, Ye Xiao, has come here to seek advice from the Ancestors on a few matters."</p><p></p><p>"Please speak freely."</p><p></p><p>"First, I have encountered a bottleneck in my cultivation. Although I have already broken through to the peak of the Emperor Realm, with one hundred and eight dragons, and have even used this 1,808 dragon qi to temper my divine soul, I still have not shown any signs of advancement."</p><p></p><p>"Second, what is the treasure that the Ancestors have left for us? Where is it? Do you have any clues?"</p><p></p><p>"We guessed that you came in to ask about these two things. Let's first take a look at your cultivation."</p><p></p><p>The figures flew around Ye Xiao, carefully examining him.</p><p></p><p>These Ancestral Spirits, who were all at the Divine Realm level in the past, even after their fall, still possessed many formidable abilities with just their spiritual bodies.</p><p></p><p>Some were adept in eye techniques, some in spiritual power, and some in regular martial arts - each had their own strengths, and could be considered all-rounders.</p><p></p><p>Most of the current human race's talents were inherited from them.</p><p></p><p>Of course, some may have awakened other attributes inherent in the Xuanyuan Clan's genes.</p><p></p><p>"This child's physique is so perfectly sculpted! It's far stronger than my own Emperor Realm physique before I stepped into the Divine Realm."</p><p></p><p>"At twenty-three years old, his bone age has already reached the peak of the Emperor Realm, his talent is truly rare in history.</p><p></p><p>Normally, someone with his talent should have a very fast cultivation speed, and would require a large amount of resources to ensure his physique is perfected to a sufficient degree.</p><p></p><p>Yet, he has managed to sculpt his body to this perfect state in such a barren world. This is truly remarkable!"</p><p></p><p>"Little child, according to normal logic, your physique has already reached the qualifications to advance to the Divine Realm, and it is extremely perfect.</p><p></p><p>Since you have not broken through to the Divine Realm, it's possible that there is an issue with your divine soul. Summon out your divine soul and let us take a look."</p><p></p><p>Ye Xiao nodded. </p><p></p><p>Since these were his ancestors, and they were now just spiritual bodies, he didn't need to worry about them doing anything to him. Letting them see his divine soul was fine.</p><p></p><p>With that in mind, he slowly released his Golden Book divine soul.</p><p></p><p>The moment the Golden Book divine soul emerged, all the Ancestral Spirits' spiritual bodies were instantly knocked down, as if suppressed by an unnamed powerful force, unable to even get up.</p>

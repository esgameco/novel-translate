        <h1>Chapter 213</h1>
        <div class="content">
            <p>Here is the full English translation of the Chinese excerpt:</p><p></p><p>Susan couldn't help but interject, "Honestly, that Ye Xiao has only taken advantage of his cultivation base. His cultivation is a bit stronger than ours. But if he really encounters a Primordial Ninth Grade expert, he would be reduced to trash in an instant. Once the Tiger God appears, he probably won't even last two seconds."</p><p></p><p>Iron Ox spoke up again: "The next beast calamity is coming soon. When that happens, will the Tiger God sense us here and come to save us?"</p><p></p><p>Moyu smiled faintly. "Iron Ox, do you think that human boy has the qualifications to compare himself to the Tiger God? The Tiger God doesn't even need to come personally. Just sending one of the three great generals would be enough to rescue us in an instant."</p><p></p><p>"You're right, I overestimated that kid." </p><p></p><p>"Hahaha!"</p><p></p><p>The entire breeding ground under the seal suddenly burst into loud laughter. For these unfortunate star beasts, this was a rare moment of joy - a self-comforting psychological victory.</p><p></p><p>However, just as the star beasts were laughing heartily, Ye Xiao suddenly appeared inside the seal. In an instant, all the laughter and cheer vanished. The air fell into a deathly silence, filled with a terrifying, oppressive aura.</p><p></p><p>"What joyful matter were you all discussing? Why did the laughter stop the moment I arrived?" Ye Xiao asked curiously. The corners of the star beasts' mouths twitched uncontrollably. </p><p></p><p>How could they still laugh with you here? Moreover, the joyful matter we were discussing was your miserable plight! Mocking you to your face - wouldn't that be courting death? Seeing them not speaking, Ye Xiao didn't mind.</p><p></p><p>After all, they were just providing him with a steady supply of vital energy and spiritual energy. As long as he could continuously benefit from them, that was all that mattered.</p><p></p><p>He tossed Saimuel in front of the star beasts and spoke again, "He has not completely died yet. It won't be long before his powerful healing ability revives him. From today on, he will be your new companion. I hope you can get along well and not cause me any trouble."</p><p></p><p>With that, Ye Xiao turned and left. As soon as he was gone, the star beasts couldn't help but gather around.</p><p></p><p>"Who is this unlucky fellow? Couldn't he have gone anywhere else but here in Jianghai City? His brain must have been kicked by a donkey."</p><p></p><p>"I think it's not just his brain that was kicked by a donkey. His luck is also terrible."</p><p></p><p>The star beasts commented as they silently examined the other's body. However, the moment they saw the other's face, Moyu suddenly covered her mouth, Iron Ox let out a sharp scream, and Susan stumbled back several steps.</p><p></p><p>"Impossible, impossible! How could this be?"</p><p></p><p>The other star beasts had confused expressions on their faces. </p><p></p><p>"What's going on?"</p><p>"What's wrong with you all?"</p><p></p><p>Only Nolphius spoke in a strange tone, "This guy's face looks familiar. I think he's the Wind God Saimuel?"</p><p></p><p>At these words, the other star beasts fell silent. The fighting spirit that had just risen was instantly crushed to the bottom.</p><p></p><p>The shock they felt was no less than the arrival of the apocalypse. They had originally thought that Ye Xiao only had the advantage of cultivation over them.</p><p></p><p>Facing those veteran star beast experts or the talented star beast experts who had been cultivating outside, they were certain to lose. But unexpectedly, Ye Xiao had instantly subdued Saimuel, one of the three great generals under the Tiger God.</p><p></p><p>This made everyone have a whole new understanding of Ye Xiao's terrifying power. This guy was not human at all!</p><p></p><p>Susan slowly walked to the side and transformed back into a bee, beginning to collect pollen and make honey.</p><p></p><p>After Ye Xiao left the breeding ground, the speed of spiritual energy absorption in the entire Jianghai City increased significantly. This time, he had placed an entire Primordial Ninth Grade divine beast-level star beast inside, which was far stronger than the previous few star beasts. So the effect he brought was the best.</p><p></p><p>All the people in Jianghai City could feel this change in spiritual energy. Everyone knew that it was Senior Swordsman Jian who was helping Jianghai City again.</p><p></p><p>Instantly, countless posts praising Senior Swordsman Jian appeared online. Even Dou Chang and the others couldn't help but sigh in their own homes.</p><p></p><p>"Senior Swordsman Jian is truly remarkable! The speed of spiritual energy absorption makes me feel afraid. This speed is almost comparable to the capital state."</p><p></p><p>"It's just a pity that Master Chen Qingxuan and the others haven't come yet. Otherwise, they could take a look at what's inside the array on the ground."</p><p></p><p>"By the way, have they still not found the masters? It's been a day and a night already."</p><p></p><p>"They're doing their best to search. Some of the defense team members have even been exhausted from the constant searching, but they still haven't found Professor Chen and the others."</p><p></p><p>Here is the full English translation of the Chinese excerpt:</p><p></p><p>"He's still out there running around, he hasn't even had a chance to drink some water."</p><p></p><p>Changfeng let out a long sigh towards the heavens. "Qingxuan, where are you? Why haven't you come out yet?"</p><p></p><p>The other side had several great masters and a divine patriarch protecting them, so he didn't think Cheng Qingxuan was in any trouble. But it's been a day and a night, the person who should have come yesterday still hasn't shown up.</p><p></p><p>He couldn't help but feel a bit worried.</p><p></p><p>At this time, Ye Xiao also returned home.</p><p></p><p>Huanliuli had already prepared the meal, turning the meat and eggs of the star beasts into a sumptuous dinner.</p><p></p><p>Seeing Ye Xiao return, she immediately stepped forward, kneeling before Ye Xiao and handing him his slippers.</p><p></p><p>"Master, you're back."</p><p></p><p>Ye Xiao: "(...)"! </p><p></p><p>This silly cat's mental state was becoming increasingly unstable.</p><p></p><p>Now she's doing all these flamboyant things, making her look like the female lead in a movie.</p><p></p><p>He really didn't know what madness had possessed her.</p><p></p><p>"Can you be a bit more normal?"</p><p></p><p>"Yes, my dear master." </p><p></p><p>She even batted her big eyes.</p><p></p><p>She felt so fulfilled being Ye Xiao's servant now!</p><p></p><p>The feeling of being able to command several divine patriarch star beasts was incredibly intoxicating.</p><p></p><p>So she wanted to be an even more perfect servant, she couldn't let herself fall out of favor with Ye Xiao.</p><p></p><p>"If you keep talking to me in this yin-yang weird way, I'll cut out your tongue."</p><p></p><p>Huanliuli shuddered in fright, quickly standing up and bowing to Ye Xiao: "Master, the food is ready, would you like to have it now?"</p><p></p><p>"That's better." </p><p></p><p>Ye Xiao felt a little better.</p><p></p><p>He really couldn't stand this cat acting coquettish, it was so disgusting to him.</p><p></p><p>"Master, please have a seat, I'll serve the food right away."</p><p></p><p>Huanliuli quickly brought out the sumptuous meal.</p><p></p><p>Ye Xiao tasted it, and Huanliuli looked at him expectantly.</p><p></p><p>"Master, how is it? Is the taste much better today?"</p><p></p><p>Ye Xiao nodded.</p><p></p><p>"It's quite good, it seems your cooking skills have improved!"</p><p></p><p>"Thank you for the praise, master. I learned these cooking methods from the internet."</p><p></p><p>"Not bad, you've made progress. From tomorrow on, you can have an egg a day."</p><p></p><p>"Thank you, master." </p><p></p><p>Huanliuli's eyes lit up as she expressed her gratitude.</p><p></p><p>Ye Xiao pushed one of the fried eggs towards her, and Huanliuli was about to start eating, but then remembered something and spoke up:</p><p></p><p>"Oh right, master. When I went to pick the spirit flowers just now, I saw a group of people in your formation. </p><p></p><p>They even called out to me, but I didn't respond to them.</p><p>I was afraid they would attack me if they saw I was a star beast."</p><p></p><p>Ye Xiao ate a piece of Xuantuo python meat, casually saying, "You did the right thing. They won't be harmed in my formation, but the formation won't protect you. If you go near them, they might very well hurt you. By the way, what did they look like?"</p><p></p><p>"Hmm~!"</p><p></p><p>Huanliuli raised her little head and thought for a moment.</p><p></p><p>"There was an old man, and a few middle-aged people. But their cultivation was quite strong, basically all above the great sect level, and one of them had already reached the divine patriarch realm at the early seventh grade."</p><p></p><p>Ye Xiao: "?!"</p><p></p><p>Their strength was not low at all!</p><p></p><p>Globally, they could be considered a small but extremely powerful group.</p><p></p><p>Wait a minute, something seems a bit off here.</p><p></p><p>This group of people, where did they come from? They couldn't have just randomly appeared in Jianghai City, right?</p><p></p><p>Could it be... Ye Xiao's expression suddenly turned grim.</p><p></p><p>He had just remembered what Gu Hai had told him that morning.</p><p></p><p>The capital state was going to send some formation masters to help Jianghai City establish formations, but they had gone missing midway.</p><p></p><p>Could it be them?</p><p></p><p>"I'll go take a look."</p><p></p><p>With that, Ye Xiao immediately activated the divine will technique and left the house.</p><p></p><p>Huanliuli hurriedly called out, "Master, don't go, your food will get cold soon."</p><p></p><p>She quickly followed after him.</p><p></p><p>A few minutes later, Huanliuli finally caught up, panting heavily. She looked at the several corpses in front of her and took several deep breaths before gradually calming down.</p><p></p><p>"Master, they seem to have all frozen to death."</p><p></p><p>Ye Xiao silently nodded. He was a bit at a loss.</p><p></p><p>In fact, the formation he had set up had a shielding effect. Normal living beings would be guided out, but if they harbored impure intentions and refused to leave, or tried to break through his formation, they would be met with the formation's backlash.</p><p></p><p>Fifth update, 15,000 words.</p><p></p><p>Seeking recommendations, monthly votes, and recommendation votes.</p><p></p><p>(Chapter end)</p>

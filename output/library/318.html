        <h1>Chapter 318</h1>
        <div class="content">
            <p>Here is the full English translation of the Chinese excerpt:</p><p></p><p>The Great Emperor Dragon Lion had just figured out this problem, when in the next second, Ye Xiao struck him with another punch on the chest.</p><p></p><p>A huge fist print was smashed into a deep pit on his chest, and the massive impact force sent him flying like a cannonball, turning into a beam of light and plummeting rapidly.</p><p></p><p>Finally, he shot down from the top of a ten-thousand-meter tall mountain in the Central State, crashing straight to the mountain base, completely collapsing the entire ten-thousand-meter high mountain.</p><p></p><p>The terrifying booming sounds reverberated through the heavens and earth, and the people of the Nine States hidden in the seals couldn't help but tremble at this sight.</p><p></p><p>What level of battle was this? </p><p></p><p>A ten-thousand-meter high mountain, shattered in an instant.</p><p></p><p>The power of a single attack had already exceeded the limits of human comprehension.</p><p></p><p>The Great Emperor Dragon Lion did not die, as Ye Xiao had not used his full strength.</p><p></p><p>He was just testing how powerful his divine techniques were.</p><p></p><p>Now it could be determined that at around 80% of his full power, he could already inflict sufficient damage on a Transcendent Deity.</p><p></p><p>If he could reach 90% or even 100% of his power, he could likely instantly annihilate a Transcendent Deity.</p><p></p><p>Of course, Ye Xiao would not be overly arrogant. Although the Great Emperor Dragon Lion was a Transcendent Deity, he had just recently reached that level by relying on the Seven Star Convergence. The strength of the veteran Transcendent Deities would certainly be far greater than his.</p><p></p><p>However, since he had confirmed that his divine techniques were on par with imperial arts, allowing him to fight beyond his level, Ye Xiao felt reassured.</p><p></p><p>This meant he could still remain invincible at his current level. As long as he continued to enhance his dragon qi, raising his strength to even higher levels, he would not need to worry about fighting veteran Transcendent Deities or Emperors.</p><p></p><p>At this time, the Great Emperor Dragon Lion had struggled to his feet from the ground. Although he had sustained very heavy injuries, his powerful Transcendent Deity physique was not to be underestimated, and he still had sufficient vitality.</p><p></p><p>With a thought, Ye Xiao appeared by his side.</p><p></p><p>Pale golden blood flowed from the Great Emperor Dragon Lion's mouth as he stared fixatedly at Ye Xiao, gritting his teeth:</p><p></p><p>"I never expected to be defeated by you. But don't get too cocky - even if I'm not your match, I still have twenty other Transcendent Deity spirit beasts behind me! And the other states will also refine divine blood to create more Transcendent Deity spirit beasts. Can you suppress not just one, but ten, dozens, or even hundreds of Transcendent Deity experts?"</p><p></p><p>Ye Xiao gave him a glance and kicked him in the crotch.</p><p></p><p>"Aoww!"</p><p></p><p>The Great Emperor Dragon Lion let out an agonized, miserable cry.</p><p></p><p>Ye Xiao slowly withdrew his foot and spoke indifferently:</p><p></p><p>"When you get hit, stand up properly instead of rambling threats. Your brain must have grown on your ass."</p><p></p><p>The Great Emperor Dragon Lion had just been deprived of his arms by Ye Xiao and couldn't cover himself, so he could only tightly clench his legs, his massive body curling up. He glared at Ye Xiao with a murderous gaze, wishing he could swallow and skin him alive, but didn't dare say another word, afraid Ye Xiao would deliver another crippling blow.</p><p></p><p>This damned human race, utterly shameless, actually kicking him there. Could that even be kicked?</p><p></p><p>He already felt that one of his treasures had been shattered, and the long one had been broken.</p><p></p><p>He had previously thought that his spirit beasts eating people was already despicable enough, but seeing the human race, he realized that the spirit beasts' consumption of people was nothing compared to the humans.</p><p></p><p>Ye Xiao spoke again:</p><p></p><p>"I have one thing to ask you. Is there someone behind you all?"</p><p></p><p>The Profound Heaven Astral Formation was just an imperial art, and within the same level, it could not scan the opponent's spiritual power. Ye Xiao could only use interrogation through words and actions.</p><p></p><p>The originally agonized Great Emperor Dragon Lion immediately narrowed his eyes, but soon denied it: "I don't know what you're talking about."</p><p></p><p>"Oh, you don't know what I'm talking about, huh?"</p><p></p><p>Ye Xiao extended his hand, and a nine-foot long sword beam extended from it.</p><p></p><p>"I just saw that yours is about half a meter in diameter. Let's see if I can slice it off with this nine-foot long sword."</p><p></p><p>The Great Emperor Dragon Lion: "..."</p><p></p><p>Ye Xiao continued:</p><p></p><p>"I only know that tiger's thing can be used to make tonic wine to nourish the essence and energy. I wonder if the lion's is any good."</p><p></p><p>The Great Emperor Dragon Lion gritted his teeth and said, "Have some humanity! Does a person have to die?"</p><p></p><p>Ye Xiao flicked the sword beam, and the sword energy forged from spiritual power let out a hum, emanating a chill in the air.</p><p></p><p>"I also have healing arts. I can cut one off, heal it, then cut another, and open a shop to let every human buy the precious tonic wine made from your treasures."</p><p></p><p>"You-!"</p><p></p><p>The Great Emperor Dragon Lion was almost on the verge of collapse from rage.</p><p></p><p>This guy was completely unreasonable, and what infuriated him even more was that he couldn't defeat Ye Xiao.</p><p></p><p>"There is!" he finally relented.</p><p></p><p>"The Deity Clan?"</p><p></p><p>The Great Emperor Dragon Lion nodded.</p><p></p><p>"Which Deity Clan?"</p><p></p><p>"I don't know the details. I've just recently advanced to Transcendent Deity, and haven't even seen the face of the mastermind behind this."</p><p></p><p>Ye Xiao stared at him intently, making the Great Emperor Dragon Lion extremely uncomfortable.</p><p></p><p>"I-I only heard the elders mention something about a young master. But I really don't know who this young master is."</p><p></p><p>Here is the full English translation of the Chinese novel excerpt:</p><p></p><p>Ye Xiao continued to stare at him fixatedly, angering the Emperor Dragon Lion, who let out a roar.</p><p></p><p>"Even if you kill me, I still don't know anything. I've told you everything I know, so what else do you want me to do? Don't go too far, because if you really push me too far, I'll self-detonate, and you won't fare any better either."</p><p></p><p>Ye Xiao lightly tapped the Emperor Dragon Lion's face with his sword light.</p><p></p><p>"Don't try any tricks on me. And you think that in front of me, you can just self-detonate whenever you want? Even if you self-detonate a million times, I can revive you a million times. Do you believe me or not?"</p><p></p><p>The Emperor Dragon Lion closed his eyes, not wanting to see Ye Xiao humiliating him, as if out of sight, out of mind.</p><p></p><p>Of course, he knew Ye Xiao's methods.</p><p></p><p>Before he came just now, he had already seen in the sky above that Ye Xiao had used his abilities.</p><p></p><p>He had instantly revived the already self-detonated Kaxil, and if he could instantly revive Kaxil, who was only at the half-step Emperor Realm, then he could revive him as well!</p><p></p><p>Ye Xiao raised his hand and sent a stream of spiritual energy into the Emperor Dragon Lion's body, sealing its spiritual energy. In this way, without Ye Xiao's unsealing, the Emperor Dragon Lion would be unable to release enough spiritual energy.</p><p></p><p>Later, he would put him in the Star Beast Breeding Ground, set up a separate pit for him, and seal him with the Diabolical Heavenly Formation.</p><p></p><p>Although Ye Xiao had never eaten lion meat before, he reckoned the taste of a Super Immortal Realm star beast expert would not be bad. This was the first Super Immortal Realm star beast he had captured, so it held great commemorative significance. He decided that when he returned, he would eat a few more pieces of its meat.</p><p></p><p>Afterwards, Ye Xiao also stored the Emperor Dragon Lion in his spatial storage ring.</p><p></p><p>In the spatial storage ring, Kaxil and the other star beasts ranked high on the Star Ranking were constantly encouraging and cheering each other on.</p><p></p><p>"Hold on, everyone. A Super Immortal expert has come to save us. It won't be long before we can break out."</p><p></p><p>"That's right, a Super Immortal expert, comparable to the human Emperor Realm, and I can sense that the one who has come this time should be Senior Emperor Dragon Lion."</p><p></p><p>Hearing the name Emperor Dragon Lion, the other star beasts couldn't help but have their eyes light up.</p><p></p><p>"Since it's Senior Emperor Dragon Lion coming to save us, then we're as good as saved."</p><p></p><p>"Senior Emperor Dragon Lion was already a top-tier existence ranked 27th on the Star Ranking when he was at the Divine Beast Realm. Later, with the Seven Stars Converging, he directly broke through to the Super Immortal Realm and is now ranked 21st on the Star Ranking. His cultivation and combat experience are not to be underestimated."</p><p></p><p>"That's right? Back then, when he was at the Divine Beast Realm, he fought against four opponents and was able to heavily injure one, cripple one, and kill two! He established a glorious battle record and was even written into the Star Beast Glory Anthology as one of the brightest new stars among our star beasts in the past millennium!"</p><p></p><p>The star beasts were all spirited, as if they had already seen the dawn of victory!</p><p></p><p>However, at this moment, a massive figure was suddenly thrown out of Ye Xiao's storage ring, landing right on top of Kaxil.</p><p></p><p>"This damned human actually dares to throw things at me?" </p><p></p><p>He angrily tore off the thing on top of him and viciously kicked the huge body dozens of meters away.</p><p></p><p>Both sides had their cultivation sealed by Ye Xiao, so they could only rely on their physical strength.</p><p></p><p>But when they were close, the others couldn't see his figure clearly, and only after Kaxil kicked him away did they get a good look at his body.</p><p></p><p>The air immediately fell into a deathly silence.</p><p></p><p>"Why do I feel like this figure looks like Lord Emperor Dragon Lion?"</p><p></p><p>The Emperor Dragon Lion they had just been praising had, in the blink of an eye, been thrown in like a dead dog by this human Emperor Realm expert.</p><p></p><p>This human Emperor Realm expert was not a new Emperor Realm expert, right?</p><p></p><p>How could he be so strong? How did he cultivate? Kaxil shuddered and hurriedly went forward to check.</p><p></p><p>"It really is Lord Emperor Dragon Lion! Lord Emperor Dragon Lion, are you alright? Your subordinate was a bit impulsive just now and offended you. Please punish me."</p><p></p><p>The Emperor Dragon Lion kept his eyes tightly closed. If this were any other time, he would have already bitten Kaxil, that idiot, to death.</p><p></p><p>But now, he couldn't open his eyes. </p><p></p><p>A mighty Super Immortal expert had actually been beaten into this sorry state by a human Emperor Realm expert, his two arms dislocated, thrown around like a dead dog.</p><p></p><p>If he opened his eyes, that would be truly embarrassing.</p><p></p><p>Rather than be embarrassed, he might as well pretend to be dead! As long as he wasn't embarrassed, the embarrassment would fall on others!</p><p></p><p>After Ye Xiao returned to the Central Prefecture City, Jiang Chen and Beitang Ce immediately came to welcome him.</p><p></p><p>"Ye Xiao, are you injured?"</p><p></p><p>Ye Xiao shook his head.</p><p></p><p>The two elders immediately heaved a sigh of relief, their eyes brimming with joy.</p><p></p><p>Impressive, to single-handedly face off against an expert comparable to the human Emperor Realm and not only emerge unscathed, but also beat the other party to a pulp.</p><p></p><p>This level of strength, if it were any other newly entered Emperor Realm expert, they would not be able to accomplish.</p><p></p><p>Ye Xiao was not only a genius, but also a seasoned combatant!</p><p></p><p>This was truly rare and precious.</p>

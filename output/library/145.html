        <h1>Chapter 145</h1>
        <div class="content">
            <p>Here is the full English translation of the Chinese excerpt:</p><p></p><p>The other star beasts couldn't help but simultaneously take a deep breath.</p><p></p><p>Expressions of joy appeared in their eyes.</p><p></p><p>"Not bad!" </p><p></p><p>The one who spoke was a female star beast wearing a feather coat. She smiled and nodded, "Senior Noerfeisi has been famous for a long time. Even a thousand years ago, he had already entered the Divine Sect realm. Later, he even reached the peak of the Divine Sect, and was only one step away from a breakthrough.</p><p></p><p>If we can first rescue his detached body, we'll have a way to then rescue his main body. </p><p></p><p>At that time, with the assistance of a peak Divine Sect expert, our chances of success will increase significantly."</p><p></p><p>The star beasts' mouths curled up, and excited smiles appeared on their faces.</p><p></p><p>"Those foolish humans actually transferred such a powerful Divine Sect expert like Noerfeisi to a small place to seal him. They really have a death wish.</p><p></p><p>Do they think Noerfeisi Senior is like that trash Aier King?"</p><p></p><p>"Alright, don't waste time. You all quickly recover your strength, and I'll personally go to Jianghai City to rescue Noerfeisi Senior."</p><p></p><p>"If that's the case, then we'll have to trouble Miss Fenghuang."</p><p></p><p>Under the starlight, a golden-brown light beam quickly flew towards the direction of Jianghai City.</p><p></p><p>The night passed quickly.</p><p></p><p>In the blink of an eye, it was dawn.</p><p></p><p>Ye Xiao woke up from the early morning. The quilt was still the same as before, with an overly high slope that was gradually becoming even steeper.</p><p></p><p>Previously, when Ye Xiao was just cultivating, the height didn't increase, only the rigidity strength. </p><p></p><p>After eating the Black-scaled Snake, Black Xuanwu Saint Envoy, and Aier King, the height kept increasing.</p><p></p><p>Could it be that eating these star beasts would bring about physical changes? But thinking about it carefully, it does seem to be the case.</p><p></p><p>The aura of star beasts is on average higher than that of the human race, as the human race has the weakest aura.</p><p></p><p>After eating powerful star beasts, Ye Xiao's own aura would continuously rise, so his physical qualities in all aspects would surpass what they were before.</p><p></p><p>This can be considered a good thing.</p><p></p><p>Because with the increase of the inner aura, Ye Xiao's cultivation will become stronger.</p><p></p><p>The aura is of great help for absorbing the spiritual energy of heaven and earth, as well as for physical combat prowess.</p><p></p><p>After getting up, Ye Xiao measured his height again, feeling like he had grown another two centimeters taller.</p><p></p><p>This made him slightly worried.</p><p></p><p>Could it be that his height will also keep increasing? If that's the case, would he turn into a giant? If that happens, Ye Xiao is very averse to it, as he is a normal person who only likes normal human body proportions.</p><p></p><p>But it should be fine. There are many people who have eaten star beasts, and he hasn't heard of anyone who developed abnormalities from eating their flesh.</p><p></p><p>However, directly eating star cores can cause some physical changes.</p><p></p><p>But he doesn't eat star cores.</p><p></p><p>Ye Xiao measured a bit, and the meat of Noerfeisi from last night provided about a 1% increase in his cultivation.</p><p></p><p>After all, it was only a detached body of Noerfeisi, not the whole, or even just a small part of the whole.</p><p></p><p>Being able to increase his cultivation by this much is already quite good.</p><p></p><p>Looking at this, star beasts are truly treasures for humans.</p><p></p><p>Star cores can be refined into pills, and their techniques can be extracted. The flesh of star beasts can also be eaten to increase one's cultivation, although not by much.</p><p></p><p>Their fur, scales, horns, and bones can all be used to refine weapons.</p><p></p><p>In the future, when Ye Xiao's strength reaches a peak realm, he must consider going to the Star Battlefield.</p><p></p><p>When Ye Xiao came downstairs, ready to go to work, he couldn't help but be slightly taken aback.</p><p></p><p>On the sofa was a 1.45-meter cat-eared girl - Huan Liuli!</p><p></p><p>She had grown taller! </p><p></p><p>Most importantly, her cultivation had broken through! She had reached the Saint Master realm at the Innate Fourth Grade.</p><p></p><p>After reacting, the corners of Ye Xiao's mouth curled up slightly.</p><p></p><p>Very good, worthy of a Dragon-level bloodline.</p><p></p><p>After eating so many high-grade star beasts, she has grown rapidly.</p><p></p><p>At this rate, it won't be long before Huan Liuli can become a Divine Sect expert.</p><p></p><p>By then, combined with himself, there will be two Divine Sect experts.</p><p></p><p>Should he unseal Noerfeisi's restriction and dig him out, then have the whole of him eaten? That way, both he and Huan Liuli's cultivation should increase a bit more.</p><p></p><p>But after thinking about it, Ye Xiao rejected this idea.</p><p></p><p>Noerfeisi is used to provide spiritual energy for the entire Jianghai City. If he digs up Noerfeisi, all the people in Jianghai City will not be able to receive the spiritual energy feedback, which would be a bit too much.</p><p></p><p>But there's no need to be too anxious. Didn't the previous news say that the Seven-Star Convergence caused several Divine Sect-level star beasts to escape?</p><p></p><p>If he can capture and eat those Divine Sect-level star beasts, it should also be able to increase his aura.</p><p></p><p>"Mmm~ Master, why have you been staring at me?" Huan Liuli said with a yawn as she stretched on the sofa.</p><p></p><p>Here is the full English translation of the Chinese excerpt:</p><p></p><p>Huan Liuli groggily got up from the sofa, stretching and taking a deep breath. The buttons on her clothes couldn't withstand the pressure and popped off.</p><p></p><p>Ye Xiao couldn't help but sigh, this little kitten has really grown up!</p><p></p><p>He then took some money out of his pocket.</p><p></p><p>"I'm going to work. Also, you should go buy some new clothes, these are too small and don't fit you well."</p><p></p><p>Huan Liuli looked at the stack of red bills Ye Xiao handed her but didn't reach out to take them.</p><p></p><p>"A few hundred can't buy much clothes? It's not even enough for a pair of stockings. You keep the money and spend it yourself, let your online fans buy for you."</p><p></p><p>Ye Xiao's expression darkened a bit.</p><p></p><p>"Don't always let your online fans buy you things, you don't even know them, and you're not dating anyone either. They work hard for that money, it's not easy for them, it's rude of you to do that."</p><p></p><p>How is this any different from fishing? Ye Xiao really disliked this kind of woman, naturally he didn't want Huan Liuli to do such things.</p><p></p><p>He was a person who had been influenced and educated by socialism, his values had to conform to the correct ones.</p><p></p><p>Just because he had come to this world, cultivated for over a year, and become a powerful Shen Zong expert, doesn't mean he could bully and take advantage of ordinary people.</p><p></p><p>How would that be any different from an evil demonic overlord? Of course, there was also the fact that Huan Liuli's mind wasn't very sharp, Ye Xiao was seriously worried that she might get scammed.</p><p></p><p>Huan Liuli just shrugged her shoulders.</p><p></p><p>"Don't worry, although I don't have money, my cat personality is still reliable. I'll only chat with rich second-generation young masters, I absolutely won't cheat ordinary people. I'll only scam the rich."</p><p></p><p>"The money of the rich is also earned through the hard work of others, you can't scam them either."</p><p></p><p>"Then I'll go steal."</p><p></p><p>Ye Xiao silently put his hand on his belt buckle, feeling a strong murderous intent, which frightened Huan Liuli. She immediately put on a well-behaved appearance and took the money.</p><p></p><p>"Master, don't be angry, I'll go buy some clothes at the roadside stalls right away."</p><p></p><p>Ye Xiao then calmed down and went to work at the library.</p><p></p><p>At the library, there were new people today who had finished their training and could start working.</p><p></p><p>Ouyang Yunzhong arranged one of them for Ye Xiao's area.</p><p></p><p>After all, Ye Xiao was a subordinate she had brought up, and she was about to retire, so while she was still in power, she arranged a subordinate for Ye Xiao, so he would have someone to use, at least for tasks like cleaning.</p><p></p><p>Ye Xiao went to the fourth floor, his own area, and a woman in her late twenties immediately came up to him and stood at attention.</p><p></p><p>She had a goose egg-shaped face, short hair, and was around 1.68 meters tall, giving an extremely capable impression. Her bearing was not low, comparable to Qin Yuyan's.</p><p></p><p>"Manager, hello."</p><p></p><p>Ye Xiao nodded and glanced at her, slightly surprised.</p><p></p><p>She was at the late Sixth Order, almost reaching the Seventh Order in strength.</p><p></p><p>This person has some potential.</p><p></p><p>Moreover, a faint murderous aura was emanating from her, she must have killed many star beasts. Could it be that she was a veteran from the Star Battlefield? But not entirely, Ye Xiao clearly felt a slightly irrational bloodthirsty aura from her, as if she had consumed star cores.</p><p></p><p>Star cores couldn't be directly swallowed, they contained the essence and ferocity of the star beasts. Once a human consumed them, even a pure human, they would gradually turn into a beastman, until the bloodthirstiness of the star beasts completely devoured them, turning them into a mindless star beast.</p><p></p><p>It seems this person has some stories.</p><p></p><p>"What's your name?"</p><p></p><p>"To answer the manager, my name is Yang Qian. I'm a retired soldier."</p><p></p><p>Just as he had guessed.</p><p></p><p>"The work in the library is not much, just mop the floor in the evening, and before clocking out, check if any books have been returned or damaged, and record the information of the borrowed books. Other than that, you can freely arrange your own time, but don't leave our area for too long during work hours."</p><p></p><p>"Understood! Thank you, manager, for the explanation."</p><p></p><p>"Mm, that's all, you're new here, go and check the books first, get familiar with the situation."</p><p></p><p>"Yes."</p><p></p><p>Yang Qian went to check the books, her style was very capable, no wonder she was a veteran from the Star Battlefield, this kind of decisive style is not something ordinary people can do.</p><p></p><p>Ye Xiao didn't pay much attention to her, he was not interested in women.</p><p></p><p>His current interests were only reading books, eating, sleeping, and fighting star beasts.</p><p></p><p>However, what Ye Xiao didn't expect was that on the very first day, just as he was about to read the first book, he found the last basic palm technique.</p><p></p><p>"Huh?"</p><p></p><p>Feeling the divine book's spiritual energy, he recorded the technique into it. Ye Xiao was somewhat surprised.</p><p></p><p>Could this Yang Qian be a lucky carp? Sixth update, 18,000 words, please support me.</p><p></p><p>I sincerely seek your support, I feel the subscriptions are not many, it's so depressing, I'm already doing my best to update.</p><p></p><p>(This chapter ends)</p>

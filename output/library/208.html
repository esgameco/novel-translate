        <h1>Chapter 208</h1>
        <div class="content">
            <p>Here is the full English translation of the Chinese excerpt:</p><p></p><p>But a first-tier city, after all, also requires a certain degree of face.</p><p></p><p>So it's also very necessary to change to a grand master.</p><p></p><p>It's a face project.</p><p></p><p>For the Dou family, there is only a tiny bit of loss, but in return, they get a city lord of a first-tier city.</p><p></p><p>This account is simply too profitable.</p><p></p><p>The benefits of the city's upgrade also have other aspects.</p><p></p><p>For example, the resources in the Martial Arts Library, it is said, will increase some techniques that surpass even the grand masters, although the vast majority of people may not be able to see them, let alone learn them.</p><p></p><p>But the difference between having and not having is significant.</p><p></p><p>It's a matter of status.</p><p></p><p>Apart from that, the scale and number of warriors will also see a substantial increase.</p><p></p><p>Previously, in the Jiang Hai City, there were only three who had reached the Xiantian realm of grand masters, and they were all the weakest Xiantian-grade ones.</p><p></p><p>But in the future, Jiang Hai City will have more grand masters, more great masters, too many to count on both hands.</p><p></p><p>Although it won't reach the point where grand masters are as common as dogs and great masters are everywhere, the increase in high-level warriors still means that Jiang Hai City's defensive strength will increase.</p><p></p><p>After another four years, it will be the beast calamity! By then, with so many experts here to protect, what is there to worry about?</p><p></p><p>In addition, the city can also establish defensive formations. When the star beasts attack, they can be directly blocked outside.</p><p></p><p>There are also spiritual energy cannons and other offensive good things.</p><p></p><p>It can be said to be a complete upgrade.</p><p></p><p>As for him, although he is no longer the city lord, he can still do some other administrative work.</p><p></p><p>In a first-tier city, any administrative position is not lower than his previous small city lord position.</p><p></p><p>And all these tremendous changes are brought about by the senior Dao Jian Xian.</p><p></p><p>This makes Dou Tian Yu's heart hold even more reverence for Dao Jian Xian.</p><p></p><p>"Dou Tian Yu, you should know that the main reason why the Nine States has developed the small Jiang Hai City into a first-tier city is because of Dao Jian Xian."</p><p></p><p>Dou Tian Yu nodded.</p><p></p><p>"I know about this matter."</p><p></p><p>"The intention above is still hoping to get in touch with Dao Jian Xian.</p><p></p><p>After all, his power is too strong, and he is an indispensable force for the Nine States.</p><p></p><p>Of course, because of that fool from the Zhao family before, we also know that Dao Jian Xian will not casually come out to meet people.</p><p></p><p>So, the upper levels do not forcibly require you to find him, just try to get in touch with him.</p><p></p><p>If you can contact him, just tell him that whatever conditions he wants, the Nine States side will agree to them.</p><p></p><p>Furthermore, if he wants to retreat and hide, we will absolutely not disturb his life."</p><p></p><p>Dou Tian Yu nodded.</p><p></p><p>It seems that after experiencing that fool from the Zhao family, the Nine States Alliance has also become much more cautious.</p><p></p><p>However, he is clear in his heart that this is the consequence of strength.</p><p></p><p>If Dao Jian Xian did not have this strength, the upper levels might not have looked for him, and even if they found him, they would have forced him to obey orders.</p><p></p><p>Now that they know Dao Jian Xian's strength has reached the Xiantian Ninth Grade Saint Realm, they have become much more accommodating.</p><p></p><p>"Okay, I understand. I'll try my best to see if I can find Senior Dao Jian Xian. But you should also know that Senior Dao Jian Xian has never shown himself all this time. I'm afraid I may not be able to find him."</p><p></p><p>"Good, then we'll count on you."</p><p></p><p>"It's my duty to serve the country."</p><p></p><p>After Dou Tian Yu left, the few of them began to discuss in secret:</p><p></p><p>"Can he find Senior Dao Jian Xian?"</p><p></p><p>"Even if he can't find him, we have to try.</p><p></p><p>This time, the pressure from the Star Battlefield is too great, and it can no longer withstand the onslaught of the star beasts, so the beast calamity is very likely to come earlier.</p><p></p><p>This is the first time since the Ancestral Dragon unified the Nine States, in thousands of years, that the beast calamity has opened up early.</p><p></p><p>The Alliance side, until now, still dares not casually reveal the truth of the matter, for fear of causing panic. The pressure on the Alliance is really too great!</p><p></p><p>This Dao Jian Xian, not only is his combat power very strong, but his healing power is also unprecedented.</p><p></p><p>There are people in the Nine States who have already evaluated that his healing power has surpassed all the healers in the Nine States.</p><p></p><p>For the Nine States, this is like the life-saving water to quench their thirst.</p><p></p><p>With him, the Nine States can ensure that the experts will not be damaged during the beast calamity, and can maintain their fighting time.</p><p></p><p>In addition, he also knows formation techniques, which is an invaluable treasure! It can be said that he is now a walking national treasure of great value to the Nine States!</p><p></p><p>And even if he is unwilling to come out now.</p><p></p><p>During the beast calamity, he can't possibly still hide, right? Even if he can't give us help, as long as he can protect Jiang Hai City, it will still be a good thing.</p><p></p><p>After all, we have expanded Jiang Hai City into a first-tier city, and more human beings will flow in. He can at least protect more human beings."</p><p></p><p>Mentioning the beast calamity, the expressions of the group became not so good.</p><p></p><p>This beast calamity may be more severe than ever before!</p><p></p><p>"We shouldn't just stand here either. There is still a lot of work to be done for the construction of Jiang Hai City. In another hour, the formation masters sent from the capital will arrive in Jiang Hai City to start setting up the formations.</p><p></p><p>We should go prepare some materials first, so that there won't be a shortage of materials when the time comes."</p><p></p><p>Here is the full English translation of the Chinese excerpt:</p><p></p><p>On Ye Xiao's side, he had just finished planting the spiritual flowers whenYang Qian's call came through.</p><p></p><p>"Hello. What's the matter?"</p><p></p><p>"Manager, there's big trouble, have you received the news? The library is going to lay off and replace people again."</p><p></p><p>Ye Xiao raised his eyebrows slightly, looked at his phone, and found that he had just received a message, but he was busy just now and didn't notice it.</p><p></p><p>"I just saw it, what's going on? Why is the library going to replace people again?"</p><p></p><p>"I don't know either. I heard that this time, all cultivations below post-Heavenly Third Rank will be completely deleted, not leaving a single one. Manager, your cultivation is only at post-Heavenly Third Rank, can you withstand this?"</p><p></p><p>Ye Xiao replied calmly:</p><p></p><p>"I'm not sure either, wait for me to think about it a bit more before I say anything. Hang up the phone first."</p><p></p><p>"Okay, goodbye."</p><p></p><p>Yang Qian hung up the phone, and Ye Xiao hurried back while pondering.</p><p></p><p>The last time the library replaced people, it hasn't been that long, and now they're going to replace people again, the pace is a bit too fast.</p><p></p><p>If he remembered correctly, before he went to the Lin Sea, the librarian had also mentioned that the library might undergo another upgrade in the future.</p><p></p><p>Could it be that this time the library's expansion and level upgrade is very high? Will Imperial Techniques be involved? Thinking about this, Ye Xiao's gaze became somewhat complex.</p><p></p><p>The library's upgrade means the upgrade of Jianghai City.</p><p></p><p>Because the library and the city's level are matched.</p><p></p><p>But why is Jianghai City upgrading so quickly? After just experiencing so much hardship, what Jianghai City needs most now is stability.</p><p></p><p>Yet the Nine Provinces are making the pace so fast.</p><p></p><p>It's beyond Ye Xiao's expectations.</p><p></p><p>Admittedly, they think Jianghai City has him, but he's not a deity, they can't possibly build a city just for him, right?</p><p></p><p>Building a first-tier city will gather a large number of cultivators and enhance the strength of the city.</p><p></p><p>If they say it's for the sake of the Emperor's bloodline, that's just nonsense, they can completely take Qin Yushen to another place.</p><p></p><p>If they say it's to expand and protect Jianghai City, or to gather more human power... Recently, there's only one thing that can trigger this premise.</p><p></p><p>Demonic Beasts Calamity!</p><p></p><p>Ye Xiao was startled by his own somewhat crazy thoughts.</p><p></p><p>No way, it can't be that coincidental, right?</p><p></p><p>He had seen it before in the library.</p><p></p><p>The books said that the Demonic Beasts Calamity occurs once every sixty years, and it is caused by the strong cultivators in the Starry Sky Battlefield to relieve the pressure of the Starry Sky Battlefield, so they open the defense line and let some Demonic Beasts in.</p><p></p><p>But it has never been said that it would be opened within sixty years.</p><p></p><p>Unless this Demonic Beasts Calamity is too strong, so strong that the Starry Sky Battlefield can't bear it, and they have to open the defense line in advance to form the Demonic Beasts Calamity.</p><p></p><p>In more than two thousand years, it has never happened at other times, and it just happens to be when he just transmigrated over? The heavens are really playing a joke!</p><p></p><p>If that's the case, Ye Xiao has to find a way to advance to above the King Realm as soon as possible.</p><p></p><p>Ye Xiao had a premonition that after reaching the King Realm, he would be able to synthesize Imperial Techniques, and at that time, he would be able to obtain an even more powerful cultivation method that surpasses Imperial Techniques.</p><p></p><p>He would also be able to improve his cultivation faster.</p><p></p><p>And just as he left, several figures also flew over from the direction of Northern Jingzhou.</p><p></p><p>"Professor, Jianghai City is just ahead."</p><p></p><p>"That's right, let's speed up a bit. The Nine Provinces have ordered us to reinforce the formations of all cities within a year, and also to expand the scale of the formations for Jianghai City. This is a huge project, and if we don't hurry, it won't be possible to complete it."</p><p></p><p>"Professor Chen, you don't have to be so anxious. You are the most renowned formation master in the Nine Provinces. Although the workload is heavy, as long as you are here, it will definitely be completed smoothly."</p><p></p><p>The one called Professor Chen was Chen Qingxuan, the professor-level formation master of the Jingzhou Martial Arts Academy, and also the president of the Nine Provinces Formation Master Association.</p><p></p><p>Chen Qingxuan came from a renowned formation master family, and he had been immersed in formations since he was young. Due to his outstanding talent, his attainments in the path of formations were extraordinary.</p><p></p><p>This time, the Nine Provinces sent him to repair and strengthen the formations of each city, which shows his level.</p><p></p><p>To assist him in his work, the Nine Provinces dispatched a pre-Heavenly Seventh Rank Saint Disciple and four pre-Heavenly Sixth Rank Grand Disciples to serve as his assistants.</p><p></p><p>However, at this moment, Chen Qingxuan suddenly stopped.</p><p></p><p>"Wait, there's something strange up ahead."</p><p></p><p>The group suddenly stopped, and couldn't help but ask in puzzlement:</p><p></p><p>"Professor Chen, what's strange in this remote wilderness?"</p><p></p><p>Chen Qingxuan shook his head.</p><p></p><p>"I can't say exactly, but I just have this feeling. It's the feeling of a formation master. But I can't tell what it is exactly."</p><p></p><p>The others were slightly startled.</p><p></p><p>"Professor Chen, can you be more specific?"</p><p></p><p>Chen Qingxuan took a deep breath, his expression grave:</p><p></p><p>"I just feel that if we continue forward, we may encounter trouble."</p>

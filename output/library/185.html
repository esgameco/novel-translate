        <h1>Chapter 185</h1>
        <div class="content">
            <p>Here is the full English translation of the Chinese excerpt:</p><p></p><p>The great dragon let out a low roar. It was Ye Xiao's weapon, able to sense Ye Xiao's current frenzied battle intent! Ye Xiao's battle intent was its battle intent.</p><p></p><p>The lightning in the sky was still gathering, and it was becoming more and more. Ye Xiao's spiritual energy also began to pour into the great dragon's body endlessly.</p><p></p><p>That crazy power even made the great dragon feel a bit afraid.</p><p></p><p>Is this the martial dao cultivation of the master? So strong!</p><p></p><p>Even stronger than the master's spiritual cultivation.</p><p></p><p>Following such a powerful master, I must not bring shame to the master.</p><p></p><p>The great dragon controlled its body, allowing the spiritual energy to permeate its entire body, adjusting itself to the most perfect state.</p><p></p><p>When the thunderclouds in the sky had gathered to the maximum, when tens of thousands of lightning bolts descended at the same time, Ye Xiao finally made his move.</p><p></p><p>From bottom to top, slashing the heavens with a sword, unleashing his full power.</p><p></p><p>The dazzling light, like divine light, shot straight into the sky, destroying those tens of thousands of lightning bolts with irresistible force.</p><p></p><p>It then entered the cloud layer, directly slicing open a shocking sword mark in the thunderstorm cloud layer covering several huge cities.</p><p></p><p>At this moment, the entire sky was like a divine miracle descending.</p><p></p><p>Countless people were shocked to the core by this sword beam.</p><p></p><p>Since ancient times, human awe of nature has never disappeared. Even if one can cultivate the martial dao and fly freely, the power of nature is still far beyond what humans can easily contend with.</p><p></p><p>But now, there was a person who had split the thunderstorm clouds in the sky in half.</p><p></p><p>This method, this strength, in the hearts of the people, he had already transcended the ordinary human! Ye Xiao's sword strike had truly and genuinely surpassed the power of the innate ninth rank! Liu Chengxun was shocked from his body to his soul, completely numb after seeing this sword strike.</p><p></p><p>He accelerated even more desperately, finally arriving in this mountain range in the shortest time possible.</p><p></p><p>From afar, he saw a silhouette, holding a weapon that looked like a Tang sword, yet also like a sword, standing proudly between heaven and earth.</p><p></p><p>It's the Sword Immortal!</p><p></p><p>It must be the Sword Immortal!</p><p></p><p>Liu Chengxun was extremely excited, his entire soul unable to control itself.</p><p></p><p>In all these years, he had never been as excited as he was today.</p><p></p><p>Even when he himself had advanced from the innate seventh rank to the innate eighth rank, he had never been as excited as he was today.</p><p></p><p>He was about to meet that super powerhouse he had never seen before, and know his true identity.</p><p></p><p>But at this moment, the other party slowly raised his footsteps.</p><p></p><p>Liu Chengxun's pupils shrank, the Sword Immortal was leaving! "Senior, please wait! This junior-"</p><p></p><p>Unfortunately, he hadn't finished speaking when Ye Xiao directly activated the divine intent technique, his body instantly transforming into a flow of light even faster than him, disappearing from the original spot in an instant.</p><p></p><p>"Senior!"</p><p></p><p>Liu Chengxun rushed to the front, desperately shouting, but Ye Xiao had completely vanished from here.</p><p></p><p>He tightly clenched his fists.</p><p></p><p>Just one step away, just one step away, he could have seen his idol!</p><p></p><p>At this time, people from other places also began to fly over.</p><p></p><p>"It's Liu Chengxun."</p><p></p><p>"Sword Saint Liu, was that sword beam just now unleashed by you?"</p><p></p><p>Liu Chengxun shook his head and gave a self-mocking laugh.</p><p></p><p>"How could I possibly unleash a sword beam of that level? In this world, perhaps only the Sword Immortal would have that kind of strength, right?"</p><p></p><p>The crowd was shocked, filled with amazement and admiration for that Sword Immortal senior.</p><p></p><p>"Indeed, the Sword Immortal senior is truly worthy of our respect."</p><p></p><p>"A true role model for us."</p><p></p><p>Liu Chengxun sighed, shook his head, and turned to head back to Jianghai City.</p><p></p><p>He activated his cultivation technique again, and the surrounding scenery began to rapidly flow backwards.</p><p></p><p>However, at this moment, his pupils suddenly shrank.</p><p></p><p>This feeling was not right, this feeling, wasn't it the same as that night when he and Ye Xiao parted ways after dinner, a light shadow quickly flew past him? Just now, he was only focused on his melancholy mood and completely failed to notice this, what a mistake, what a mistake! Unexpectedly, he had already encountered the Sword Immortal once.</p><p></p><p>Even more unexpected was that the Sword Immortal senior was not only a super powerhouse, but also a master of body techniques.</p><p></p><p>His speed, Liu Chengxun couldn't even catch up to him, and it was laughable that he had wanted to fight him.</p><p></p><p>No wonder the Sword Immortal senior didn't want to fight him, because he truly looked down on him.</p><p></p><p>Unfortunately, he completely failed to seize the opportunity.</p><p></p><p>However, after experiencing this event, Liu Chengxun's desire for the Sword Immortal had become even more intense.</p><p></p><p>He clenched his fists.</p><p></p><p>"One year! Within one year, I must see you, Sword Immortal senior!"</p><p></p><p>At this moment, in the starry sky, in the American laboratory, the scientists were introducing their latest developed fighter aircraft to the commander.</p><p></p><p>"Commander, please believe us, this time the fighter aircraft we've brought is absolutely the most advanced."</p><p></p><p>"Really?" </p><p></p><p>The commander looked at the group of scientists with a doubtful expression, as he had already started to not believe their false words.</p><p></p><p>But aircraft technology was still an area where America had a significant advantage, so he couldn't directly give up on this research department.</p><p></p><p>Here is my translation of the Chinese excerpt:</p><p></p><p>The door. "It's true! Commander, please believe us! This time, we've equipped the fighter planes with brand new materials for the armor, to address the issues from before and ensure the safety of the fighter planes when encountering powerful cultivators, in order to enhance their combat performance."</p><p></p><p>The commander nodded, this research direction was not bad, much more reliable than before. </p><p></p><p>Previously they had only focused on speed, but forgot that while speed was enhanced, the fighter planes' defense was lacking. When encountering powerful cultivators or stellar beasts, they could be destroyed with a single strike.</p><p></p><p>In the stellar battlefield, there were so many stellar beasts, any one of which was extremely powerful. If they just happened to brush against one, the fighter planes would be ruined - what use would that be then? </p><p></p><p>No matter how much money was spent building more fighter planes, it would just be a waste of time.</p><p></p><p>"Alright, I'll spare a bit of time to take a look at your experiment, begin!"</p><p></p><p>The group was excited, quickly nodding and saying, "Okay, the experiment is starting now."</p><p></p><p>Subsequently, the scientists quickly directed the pilots to drive the fighter planes out of the base, preparing to demonstrate them.</p><p></p><p>"Play!"</p><p>"Spit!"</p><p>"Shatter!"</p><p>"Dog!"</p><p></p><p>The experiment officially began, the fighter planes from the American side became streaks of light, rapidly rushing out of the runway and then swiftly charging into the distance.</p><p></p><p>"These fighter planes don't look too bad this time," the commander nodded with interest. The scientists exchanged glances, unable to suppress the relieved smiles on their faces. </p><p></p><p>Finally, they wouldn't have to face criticism.</p><p></p><p>However! Just at that moment, suddenly there came three violent explosive roars from the distance.</p><p></p><p>Boom, boom, boom...</p><p></p><p>Then three bursts of flame erupted.</p><p></p><p>The entire experimental team was dumbfounded, staring blankly at the scene, not knowing what had happened.</p><p></p><p>"What happened?" the commander asked with hands spread, thoroughly perplexed.</p><p></p><p>A scientist in charge of monitoring spoke up: "Too fast. We had just detected an energy surge approaching rapidly, and then it passed by just as quickly. Now it's disappeared, but... all the fighter planes have been destroyed."</p><p></p><p>The commander: "(⊙⊙)!"</p><p>The scientist: "(⊙⊙)!"</p><p></p><p>Everyone was left in a daze.</p><p></p><p>What the hell? What kind of energy was that, so powerful that it could destroy all the fighter planes in an instant, without even showing its face? Just a flash of lightning?</p><p></p><p>Ye Xiao had already returned to Jianghai City. The moment Liu Chengxun came to find him, he had already sensed it. </p><p></p><p>And he had already tested the power of the Great Dragon. That was enough.</p><p></p><p>With the support of the Imperial Art and the Great Dragon, the attacks he could unleash had far surpassed his current abilities, able to contend evenly even against Xiantian Ninth Rank experts.</p><p></p><p>Although using the Great Dragon required charging up, it could still be considered a formidable trump card. And as his cultivation continued to rise, the instantaneous output of spiritual energy would greatly increase, making it even more convenient to wield in the future.</p><p></p><p>Next, he just needed to focus on further improving his cultivation.</p><p></p><p>Ye Xiao had Illusion Liuli regularly harvest the flesh, blood and eggs of Noel and the others, using the spiritual energy of these Xiantian Stellar Beasts to continuously assist in his cultivation.</p><p></p><p>At the same time, with the support of cultivation methods, his cultivation was advancing at a decent pace. The main credit went to the two heart techniques, the Purple Lotus Stellar Sea and the Dharma Sutra.</p><p></p><p>The two of them absorbed spiritual energy the fastest, allowing the fastest cultivation progress. He also had to thank Law Faith for that map that led him to the Dharma Sutra, as well as the four finger techniques.</p><p></p><p>Now he could focus his goal on the finger techniques, trying to find the last one to synthesize an Imperial Art level finger technique, before working on other cultivation methods.</p><p></p><p>Actually, Ye Xiao also wanted to vent a bit about the Golden Book. When he scanned it with spiritual power, he was unable to record the techniques - he had to read through it page by page himself. </p><p></p><p>The reason was probably that the Golden Book's imprinting ability could only be triggered through direct visual observation, not through spiritual power scanning.</p><p></p><p>If he could use the Grand Heavenly Technique to scan it, he could synthesize countless cultivation methods in a single day.</p><p></p><p>In the coming time, Ye Xiao returned to his usual lifestyle, going to work, reading books, and coming home to eat stellar beast meat.</p><p></p><p>He wondered if it was because he had already reached Xiantian Eighth Rank, while the stellar beast meat and eggs were only Xiantian Seventh Rank, so their spiritual energy was no longer enough.</p><p></p><p>Ye Xiao considered whether he should kill them, refine them into pills, and then go find Xiantian Eighth Rank stellar beasts instead.</p><p></p><p>But Xiantian Eighth Rank stellar beasts were not so easy to come by, and he didn't have any at the moment, so Ye Xiao gave up on that plan and decided to just continue his steady cultivation.</p>

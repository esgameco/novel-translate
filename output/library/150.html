        <h1>Chapter 150</h1>
        <div class="content">
            <p>Here is the full English translation of the Chinese excerpt:</p><p></p><p>"Alright, give me an address and I'll send it over to you right away."</p><p></p><p>After the Seven Star Consecutive Pearls, the city's economy had also suffered a significant impact, and Wang Dalong's recent days had not been easy either.</p><p></p><p>Now that Ye Xiao had taken away the black obsidian, a type of unpopular niche product, it had brought some relief to his cash flow, so he was naturally very happy about it.</p><p></p><p>So the next morning, Ye Xiao sent the black obsidian over to him.</p><p></p><p>It just so happened to be the weekend, and Ye Xiao was at home, extracting all the spatial power from these black obsidian and infusing it into his own spatial ring.</p><p></p><p>However, what Ye Xiao didn't expect was that after absorbing the spatial power from about one and a half truckloads of black obsidian, the spatial ring had reached its limit and could no longer continue to store any more spatial power.</p><p></p><p>"It seems that I've pushed the black obsidian to its limit."</p><p></p><p>Although black obsidian contains spatial power, spatial power is the most powerful force in this world, and black obsidian is just one of the materials that contains spatial power, and it's the lowest-grade one at that.</p><p></p><p>So if he wanted to obtain more spatial power, he would need to get his hands on better materials.</p><p></p><p>A good horse deserves a good saddle.</p><p></p><p>Of course, there was another method, which was to make a spatial bracelet and increase its size to enhance the storage capacity of spatial power.</p><p></p><p>But Ye Xiao was a grown man, wearing a bracelet would just look ridiculous. Like eating a peach?</p><p></p><p>So Ye Xiao definitely wouldn't wear any kind of bracelet.</p><p></p><p>If he made several spatial rings, that would also be too conspicuous. A grown man wearing so many rings while walking on the street would just look strange.</p><p></p><p>But the spatial ring was a necessary item.</p><p></p><p>As Ye Xiao encountered more and more Saint-Emperor-level spirit beasts, the number of spirit beasts he slew would also increase.</p><p></p><p>It wouldn't be possible to consume all of them at once, sometimes he wanted to save some meat for a slow and steady consumption.</p><p></p><p>Moreover, not all spirit beasts were as small as Ji Feng and Aer Wang, like Gnorlfiis the giant octopus, whose single tentacle was already almost too large to fit in a spatial ring.</p><p></p><p>Imagine how big the main body would be?</p><p></p><p>So Ye Xiao had to find a way to obtain some more special spatial materials to store them.</p><p></p><p>Over the next few days, Ye Xiao and Huan Liuli quickly finished eating all the chicken wings, chicken legs, chicken hearts, and chicken livers that were cut from Ji Feng.</p><p></p><p>This allowed the master-servant duo to obtain a tremendous boost to their blood qi and cultivation.</p><p></p><p>Huan Liuli's cultivation had reached a bottleneck and was about to enter self-induced hibernation to evolve.</p><p></p><p>As a naturally born Fourth-Grade cultivator, after consuming so much Saint-Emperor-level chicken meat, the increase in her cultivation was naturally sufficient for her to break through.</p><p></p><p>As for Ye Xiao, he was just a hair's breadth away.</p><p></p><p>Because Ye Xiao was already a Seventh-Grade Saint-Emperor-level cultivator.</p><p></p><p>Being at the same Saint-Emperor level, the power gained from consuming Saint-Emperor spirit beasts was naturally not as dramatic as Huan Liuli's.</p><p></p><p>But seeing that he was about to break through to the Eighth Grade, Ye Xiao didn't want to drag it out.</p><p></p><p>After all, every increase in strength would provide an extra layer of safety.</p><p></p><p>However, the chicken wings and legs from Ji Feng in the storage ring had already been completely consumed.</p><p></p><p>And the spiritual feedback showed that Ji Feng was still on the run, meaning she had not found any other Saint-Emperor spirit beasts yet, so Ye Xiao didn't want to waste time chasing her.</p><p></p><p>Staring at the empty storage ring, Ye Xiao couldn't help but feel conflicted.</p><p></p><p>Where could he get some Saint-Emperor spirit beast meat? Until he went to work and saw his grandfather's statue.</p><p></p><p>A smile then appeared on his face.</p><p></p><p>Aha, isn't this just perfect? Gnorlfiis!</p><p></p><p>A few days ago, he had colluded with Ji Feng, and he was just about to go after him, but these past few days he had gotten so addicted to eating chicken that he had forgotten all about him. What a missed opportunity.</p><p></p><p>So, on this midnight, while the entire Jianghai City had fallen into slumber, Ye Xiao used the Divine Will Technique to teleport to the statue's location.</p><p></p><p>Previously, Gnorlfiis' tentacles had opened a hole in the ground, but it had later been filled in by the municipal construction materials.</p><p></p><p>For Ye Xiao, this was no difficult task.</p><p></p><p>With a single Heavenly Sword strike, he directly cut out a cylindrical section from the ground, pulling it out to reveal a passage leading underground.</p><p></p><p>Once underground, he opened a breach in the formation, allowing him to easily enter the space where Gnorlfiis was sealed.</p><p></p><p>Gnorlfiis, after witnessing Ye Xiao's power, had been diligently cultivating underground ever since.</p><p></p><p>Although he could only gain a little cultivation progress while confined in the seal, a mosquito is still meat, after all.</p><p></p><p>At this moment, Gnorlfiis had just finished his cultivation session.</p><p></p><p>"Phew!" </p><p></p><p>He exhaled a long, murky breath, and a sinister smile appeared on his octopus-like face.</p><p></p><p>"Not bad, after a few days of cultivation, my cultivation has increased slightly.</p><p></p><p>Although they have sealed me, my bloodline is strong enough, and my true body is at the Ninth-Grade Saint-Emperor peak, with sufficient experience, so improving my cultivation is a piece of cake.</p><p></p><p>At this rate...</p><p></p><p>Here is the full English translation of the Chinese excerpt:</p><p></p><p>"Within a thousand years, my true self can at least cultivate to the Innate Eighth Grade. When that time comes, breaking this seal will be easy as pie.</p><p></p><p>Hahaha...haha...haha..."</p><p></p><p>As Noel Fei was laughing, he suddenly noticed a figure appear in front of him.</p><p></p><p>What's even more terrifying is that this figure is none other than his nightmare - Ye Xiao! "How are you here?" Noel Fei shrieked, quickly retreating and pressing himself against the seal, trying to maintain as much distance as possible between himself and Ye Xiao.</p><p></p><p>Ye Xiao did not respond to his words, but simply looked at him indifferently and said, "A few days ago, was it you who brought that Ji Feng?"</p><p></p><p>Noel Fei hurriedly waved his tentacles. </p><p></p><p>"No, no, it has nothing to do with me. I didn't even know she was coming, she came on her own. And I didn't tell her to attack you, she attacked you of her own accord. You can't blame the good fish!"</p><p></p><p>"Do you think I don't know that your wisp of divine sense was on that rooftop at the time?"</p><p></p><p>Noel Fei: "Σ(っ°Д°;)っ!"</p><p></p><p>"How is that possible? Then why didn't you come after me then?"</p><p></p><p>Suddenly, he understood.</p><p></p><p>It's not that Ye Xiao didn't come after him, but that Ye Xiao simply didn't take him seriously at all.</p><p></p><p>This guy could come after him anytime he wanted, it would be so easy.</p><p></p><p>And now he had effortlessly come here, hadn't he?</p><p></p><p>Damn it! A deep sense of powerlessness weighed heavily on Noel Fei's heart.</p><p></p><p>"Alright, I admit defeat. You can kill me or do whatever you want. But the Shaolin side went to great lengths to send me here to raise the spiritual energy of Jianghai City. If you kill me, the formation's focal point will be gone."</p><p></p><p>He made a final stubborn stand.</p><p></p><p>But to his surprise, Ye Xiao actually agreed with what he said.</p><p></p><p>"You're right, so I won't kill you."</p><p></p><p>Noel Fei was stunned.</p><p></p><p>"Then what do you want from me?"</p><p></p><p>He didn't believe that Ye Xiao had simply come to talk to him and give him a warning. </p><p></p><p>Such a powerful expert couldn't be that bored, right?</p><p></p><p>But just as he asked that question, a blade of light slashed towards him, severing two of his tentacles.</p><p></p><p>Spurting blood sprayed wildly, and Noel Fei let out a miserable scream.</p><p></p><p>"Ahhh, didn't you say you wouldn't kill me?"</p><p></p><p>Ye Xiao retrieved the two tentacles and stored them in his spatial storage ring.</p><p></p><p>"Did I kill you? No, right? I just wanted to get some blood qi from you to aid my cultivation."</p><p></p><p>With that, Ye Xiao turned and left.</p><p></p><p>"Since you can cultivate, you should be able to heal yourself, so I won't help you."</p><p></p><p>Watching Ye Xiao leave after repairing the seal, Noel Fei was almost about to explode with rage! "Ahhh, you bully me too much! If I wasn't just a fragment here, how could you humiliate me like this? Damn human, just wait, I'll settle this account with you sooner or later. </p><p></p><p>In 1,500 years!</p><p></p><p>In 1,500 years, I will swallow you alive, skin you, and turn you into an iron statue!"</p><p></p><p>After the raging fury, he looked at his severed tentacles and cried bitterly.</p><p></p><p>Damn it, he had just cultivated a bit of cultivation, and now it was all going to be wasted again.</p><p></p><p>Wuwuwu, this damn human.</p><p></p><p>Having obtained the octopus meat, Ye Xiao did not return home, but went to the great mountains on the border between Central State and Chu State.</p><p></p><p>His cultivation was just a hair's breadth away, and as long as he ate these octopus meat, he would definitely be able to break through smoothly.</p><p></p><p>And after the breakthrough, there would certainly be a celestial phenomenon.</p><p></p><p>After reaching the Innate Sixth Grade, the phenomenon had already begun, and each time it was stronger than the last.</p><p></p><p>The celestial phenomenon of the Innate Eighth Grade, if it were to happen in Jianghai City, would probably cause a huge commotion again.</p><p></p><p>Ye Xiao built a fire and roasted the tentacles, which were as thick as two giant black-scaled snakes, seasoning them with black pepper, cumin, and chili powder.</p><p></p><p>After a series of operations, the fragrant roasted octopus was freshly baked.</p><p></p><p>As he finished eating the two octopus tentacles, the blood qi in his body began to surge wildly.</p><p></p><p>At this moment, a divine lightning bolt suddenly struck down from the sky above.</p><p></p><p>Zzzzt!</p><p></p><p>The huge divine lightning bolt directly reduced the large tree next to Ye Xiao to ashes.</p><p></p><p>Ye Xiao: "(`)!"</p><p></p><p>What's going on? Even after breaking through to the Innate Eighth Grade, do I still have to be struck by lightning like in those cultivation novels?</p><p></p><p>However, after a brief observation, Ye Xiao realized that this lightning cloud was not striking him at the moment.</p><p></p><p>It might only strike at a certain future realm. And now, it seemed to be locking onto him.</p><p></p><p>Could it be that after breaking through to the Innate Ninth Grade and wanting to transcend the Divine Sect, I will be struck by lightning?</p>

        <div class="content">
            <p>Here is the full English translation of the Chinese excerpt:</p><p></p><p>Cloud XuanYuan opened his eyes and couldn't help but raise his eyebrows, saying: "This kid's talent is truly extraordinary. If my cultivation wasn't stronger than his, even I might lose if we fought.</p><p></p><p>But the problem lies in his temperament - he actually directly slaughtered his own clan. If his temperament is not good, even if he has such high talent, it would be in vain.</p><p></p><p>I absolutely cannot hand over the future of the XuanYuan Clan to someone like him."</p><p></p><p>However, at this moment, a figure suddenly flew over quickly.</p><p></p><p>"Young master, this is the secret report brought by the Cloud Family's scout, regarding all the actions of Elder Cloud Shui in the human world."</p><p></p><p>Cloud Xuanyuan took it and scanned it, and his face instantly turned ice-cold.</p><p></p><p>"Unexpectedly, that bastard! He actually did so many wrongdoings in the human world. </p><p></p><p>Attempting to slay geniuses with star beasts, and then massacring his own clan to try to get the star beasts back. Disregarding the lives of his own clan, treating them as ants - this is simply a beastly act.</p><p></p><p>No wonder that kid wanted to kill him, he truly deserved to die.</p><p></p><p>Go to the ancestral hall, extract Cloud Shui's essence blood and divine soul, and directly annihilate him, let his soul scatter without allowing him to revive.</p><p></p><p>Also, send a message to notify Ning Zhiyuan and the others, inform them of the details of this matter, so they don't get involved blindly.</p><p></p><p>Tell them that before I go, no one is allowed to seek out the Sword Immortal, and no one is allowed to harass him!"</p><p></p><p>"Yes!"</p><p></p><p>The other person took the task and immediately went to the Cloud Family's ancestral hall.</p><p></p><p>For an existence at the Elder level, their essence blood and soul would be nourished in the ancestral hall. This way, even if they died outside, the clan could still revive them.</p><p></p><p>However, Cloud Shui had done so many evil deeds, he deserved to die.</p><p></p><p>Even though he was an Elder at the Slaughter God Realm Fifth Layer, Cloud Xuanyuan absolutely would not let him off lightly.</p><p></p><p>Otherwise, where would the face of the Cloud Clan be? </p><p></p><p>If he was not annihilated, and the news spread out, wouldn't others laugh at them and despise the Cloud Clan?</p><p></p><p>So he must die without a doubt.</p><p></p><p>However, despite losing Elder Cloud Shui, Cloud Xuanyuan did not feel the slightest anger, but instead had a hint of excitement on his face.</p><p></p><p>He finally understood why Ye Xiao had to pursue and kill Cloud Shui - in this way, there was a reason behind it, and Ye Xiao's true nature could naturally not be considered evil!</p><p></p><p>If he was not evil, then there was naturally no need to punish him.</p><p></p><p>"It seems this kid can still be cultivated a bit more. I look forward to your performance in half a year."</p><p></p><p>If the other party could become even more perfect than himself, it would mean that the Xuanyuan Clan would produce an even more powerful Divine Emperor in the future.</p><p></p><p>The divine blood of the Xuanyuan Clan would also be reactivated to an even higher level!</p><p></p><p>For the sake of the Xuanyuan Clan, he could choose to sacrifice himself.</p><p></p><p>On Ye Xiao's side, he naturally didn't think so much.</p><p></p><p>Originally, he didn't want to fight with Cloud Xuanyuan, but this guy was really too outrageous.</p><p></p><p>His subordinates had no mercy towards their own clan, arbitrarily slaughtering lives, and even burning their souls, just to find him.</p><p></p><p>If he didn't kill him, who knows when he himself would die.</p><p></p><p>But Cloud Xuanyuan had attacked him.</p><p></p><p>Whether he knew the details of the matter or not, Ye Xiao didn't want to clarify.</p><p></p><p>Since he attacked him, he had to be prepared to bear the corresponding consequences.</p><p></p><p>However, although he said this, Ye Xiao was not a fool, he was clear in his heart that what he just faced was only the other party's divine sense avatar.</p><p></p><p>The other party's true strength must be far stronger than what was just displayed.</p><p></p><p>Without saying much else, he was definitely at the late Slaughter God Realm, it's just not sure if it was the Seventh, Eighth, or Ninth Layer.</p><p></p><p>As the young master of the Cloud Clan, the number one genius among the younger generation of the Xuanyuan Clan, his strength must not be low, and he should have a certain reputation.</p><p></p><p>In the next two days, he would find an opportunity to ask around and see if he could find any clues.</p><p></p><p>Now there are so many divine clans in Jianghai City, and Blue Dragon and the others have also been guided by the divine clans, attending their classes every day, so he should be able to access this knowledge.</p><p></p><p>Two days later, Elder Ning found Ning Zhiyuan, his expression grave:</p><p></p><p>"Zhiyuan, I feel we must intervene in this matter."</p><p></p><p>Ning Zhiyuan spoke:</p><p></p><p>"Uncle, are you referring to the matter of the Sword Immortal and Cloud Xuanyuan's battle?"</p><p></p><p>Elder Ning nodded.</p><p></p><p>"Correct! They are both peerless geniuses of our Xuanyuan Clan, the loss of either one would be a huge loss for our entire Xuanyuan Clan.</p><p></p><p>They both have the potential to become Divine Emperors in the future!</p><p></p><p>Just think about it, if the two of them can smoothly cultivate to the Divine Emperor realm, how much will the divine blood of our Xuanyuan Clan be activated?"</p><p></p><p>Ning Zhiyuan's expression also instantly became grave.</p><p></p><p>Uncle was right, the fall of either of them would be an irreparable loss for the Xuanyuan Clan.</p><p></p><p>Two Divine Emperors! Why does everyone in the starry sky want to become a Divine Emperor? And why does every divine clan want to cultivate more Divine Emperors? The significance of the existence of Divine Emperors is not only to protect the entire divine clan, but also to enhance the fundamental bloodline power of a divine clan.</p><p></p><p>This is of paramount importance for a divine clan.</p><p></p><p>Here is the full English translation of the Chinese novel excerpt:</p><p></p><p>When it comes to the Alliance of a Hundred Tribes, many of the races within it have become very weak. But in ancient times, they may have been a mighty divine race. It's just that with the fall of the powerful divine emperors within their race, the entire tribe has now fallen into decline.</p><p></p><p>The more divine emperors there are, and the stronger they are, the more activated divine blood there will be.</p><p></p><p>The races ranked among the top in the starry sky, such as the Dragon Clan, the Phoenix Clan, and the Qilin Clan, have many divine emperor-level experts, and their top powerhouses are extremely strong. So the bloodline power of these races is terrifyingly powerful.</p><p></p><p>It is said that in their races, there are some unbelievable things.</p><p></p><p>For example, the direct descendants of some races may possess the strength of an Emperor Martial Lord or even Divine Realm level right after birth!</p><p></p><p>How terrifying is that?</p><p></p><p>Ning Zhiyuan has been alive for a few decades now, but his current strength has only reached the Emperor Realm at around the 70th Dragon. He hasn't even reached the Divine Realm yet.</p><p></p><p>While in the younger generation of the Xuanyuan Divine Clan, the top existence, Xuan Yuanxuan, has only reached the Slay God Realm at the 9th layer!</p><p></p><p>And in this human world.</p><p></p><p>There is someone called Qinglong, who is now studying and cultivating at the Martial Arts Academy. He is several decades older than Ning Zhiyuan's second uncle, but his current cultivation is only around the 3rd Dragon of the Emperor Realm.</p><p></p><p>The power of bloodline has such a huge impact on martial artists, it's truly overwhelming.</p><p></p><p>Although Ning Zhiyuan is very dissatisfied in his heart, wondering why everyone can't start on an equal footing and compete fairly.</p><p></p><p>But from another perspective, this is the true fairness.</p><p></p><p>There is a saying that in the early days of the starry sky, the innate talents of all races were the same.</p><p></p><p>However, the ancestors of some races started cultivating earlier and cultivated extremely diligently.</p><p></p><p>Their first generation may not have been able to go too far, but by the second, third, fourth generations, and after countless generations, their bloodline power has accumulated to a terrifying, insurmountable height, making other races look up to them in awe.</p><p></p><p>That is the result of the hard work and bloodshed of countless generations, and it is what allows their descendants to enjoy the fruits today.</p><p></p><p>To the extent that they are born with the strength that others can only cultivate with great difficulty! If their own ancestors had also started cultivating earlier, and their ancestors for generations had struggled arduously, by the end, they themselves might have been born with extraordinary strength, or at least their cultivation speed would be many times faster than now!</p><p></p><p>If Dao Jian Xian and Xuan Yuanxuan both succeed in cultivating to the Divine Emperor Realm, and their powers are combined, the bloodline activation of the Xuanyuan Divine Clan will be even stronger. For the generation below them, including Ning Zhiyuan, their talents will be even more monstrous!</p><p></p><p>For example, Ning Zhiyuan has spent a few decades to cultivate to the 75th Dragon of the Emperor Realm.</p><p></p><p>Once Dao Jian and Xuan Yuanxuan become Divine Emperors, his son may only need 10-20 years to reach this realm.</p><p></p><p>So, not letting the two of them fight, and protecting them, is also establishing a millennium merit for his own descendants and the future generations of the entire Xuanyuan Divine Clan!"</p><p></p><p>"Second Uncle, you're right. I'll immediately join with the other young masters to petition the elders of Xuanyuan Mountain, requesting them to intervene and stop this upcoming battle!"</p><p></p><p>As soon as the words left his mouth, a figure suddenly rushed in from outside.</p><p></p><p>"Young Master, a major event has occurred!"</p><p></p><p>He was panting heavily, clearly having rushed here frantically.</p><p></p><p>"What's the matter?" Ning Zhiyuan asked with raised brows.</p><p></p><p>After catching his breath, the man said, "The Divine King's Tomb!"</p><p></p><p>"Another Divine King's Tomb has been discovered?"</p><p></p><p>Ning Zhiyuan was overjoyed, not expecting such good news so early in the morning. Although the previous two Divine King's Tombs were disappointing, with Dao Jian Xian taking everything, the third one couldn't possibly be taken by him as well, right?</p><p></p><p>However, before Ning Zhiyuan could finish speaking, the man hurriedly waved his hands.</p><p></p><p>"No, not a Divine King's Tomb, but a group of Divine King's Tombs! Four Divine King's Tombs, all buried together!"</p><p></p><p>"What did you say?" Ning Zhiyuan's pupils suddenly constricted, and even Ning's Second Uncle's expression changed abruptly.</p><p></p><p>"Is this true?" the Second Uncle asked.</p><p></p><p>The man nodded.</p><p></p><p>"Absolutely certain. The other young masters have already headed to the starry sky."</p><p></p><p>The Second Uncle immediately said, "Then we should go as well."</p><p></p><p>"Okay!" Ning Zhiyuan immediately ordered the preparation of a spiritual energy ship, and the uncle and nephew duo set off together.</p><p></p><p>Before they even left, the Second Uncle said, "Four tombs appearing together, and all of them are Divine King's Tombs, this time it's likely going to be a bloodbath."</p>

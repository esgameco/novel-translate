        <h1>Chapter 134</h1>
        <div class="content">
            <p>Here is the full English translation of the excerpt from the Chinese novel:</p><p></p><p>"Die...!" </p><p></p><p>A thunderous roar erupted behind Ye Xiao. The just-revived King Aier, concentrating all his strength, unleashed a punch that struck Ye Xiao's back.</p><p></p><p>A smug arc formed on King Aier's lips. </p><p></p><p>This punch utilized an imperial art that combined the effects of "hitting a cow over a mountain" and "shaking the tiger's den". It was a technique specially created to counter various imperial-grade defensive armors.</p><p></p><p>The goal was to deal a heavy blow to Ye Xiao, who was wearing imperial-grade armor.</p><p></p><p>Even if Ye Xiao did not die from this punch, he would still sustain grave injuries.</p><p></p><p>However, before King Aier's fist could land on Ye Xiao, the latter had vanished from his original spot in the blink of an eye.</p><p></p><p>This caused King Aier's pupils to constrict again.</p><p></p><p>It was a movement technique.</p><p></p><p>This human could also cultivate movement techniques. Judging from that speed that even he couldn't keep up with, it was another imperial art! Damn it! Just how many things had this human learned?</p><p></p><p>Humans may be powerful, able to learn the skills of various races, but he had never seen one who could cultivate all these things to such a high level.</p><p></p><p>At that moment, a powerful aura appeared above him - it was Ye Xiao! But just as the punching King Aier was about to strike, two terrifying shockwaves suddenly erupted from the horns on his head.</p><p></p><p>"Haha, didn't expect that, did you? I have a trump card - I can instantly change the direction of my attack. Any part of my body can be used to attack!"</p><p></p><p>This sudden change happened too fast. Before Ye Xiao could react, King Aier's horns had already struck him.</p><p></p><p>Boom! Another violent explosion, the shockwaves raging like a gale, flattening the river below and carving a massive crater over two kilometers wide on both riverbanks.</p><p></p><p>King Aier was ecstatic. In the end, the old fox was still the most cunning.</p><p></p><p>His hidden trump card combined with the imperial art specially created to break armor was enough to turn the tide of battle and easily defeat Ye Xiao.</p><p></p><p>But the next moment, a sharp pain shot through his neck, and his vision began to involuntarily rise.</p><p></p><p>His neck had been severed.</p><p></p><p>His severed head was rotating in the air.</p><p></p><p>When his vision landed on Ye Xiao, the entire sheep was completely dumbfounded.</p><p></p><p>This guy actually had a cultivation technique within his armor!</p><p></p><p>Another imperial art! A defensive imperial art! Damn it! This guy wasn't the strongest, he was the most versatile and powerful of all!</p><p></p><p>In that moment, King Aier suddenly regretted. </p><p></p><p>Regretted why he had to be so reckless and go against this guy.</p><p></p><p>As their eyes met, he instantly understood his fate.</p><p></p><p>Ye Xiao's attacks fell like raindrops, ruthlessly stripping away his physical body and soul.</p><p></p><p>This time, King Aier's power was weakened further.</p><p></p><p>And Ye Xiao, having gained experience, immediately utilized the Taixuan Heavenly Formation, filling and sealing the surrounding space with his spiritual power to form a restrictive domain.</p><p></p><p>King Aier's soul was directly locked down by Ye Xiao on the spot.</p><p></p><p>In his final moments, he suddenly smiled.</p><p></p><p>Sometimes, acceptance can come in an instant.</p><p></p><p>When he realized he was completely powerless against Ye Xiao, he no longer had any lingering resentment or desire to resist.</p><p></p><p>At this moment, he suddenly recalled what the elders of his tribe had once said - when a truly extraordinary expert emerges from the human race, that person is likely destined to become an emperor. Dying at the hands of a future human emperor would not be a disgraceful end.</p><p></p><p>A flash of light filled the sky, causing everyone to involuntarily close their eyes.</p><p></p><p>When they reopened them, the world had returned to its initial tranquility.</p><p></p><p>The stars in the sky emitted a faint glow, and the eastern horizon was tinged with a faint whitish hue.</p><p></p><p>The group, including Dou Chang, exchanged glances, as if they had an unspoken agreement, and quickly moved forward.</p><p></p><p>When they reached the riverbank, both Ye Xiao and King Aier's figures had already vanished without a trace, replaced only by the signs of the intense battle.</p><p></p><p>Standing by the river, the group stared at the awe-inspiring scene, reluctant to leave.</p><p></p><p>On Ye Xiao's side, upon returning home, Huanliuli's eyes glowed with a green light, and tears unwittingly flowed from the corners of her mouth.</p><p></p><p>A divine patriarch, a star beast expert, King Aier, had just died like this.</p><p></p><p>How tragic!</p><p>How lamentable!</p><p>How hateful!</p><p>How pitiful! How fragrant! How spicy! How salty!</p><p></p><p>"Master, shall we start the barbecue now?"</p><p></p><p>Ye Xiao smiled and nodded.</p><p></p><p>"Bring out the barbecue tools I bought online, and is the beer chilled?"</p><p></p><p>"It's been chilled and ready, just waiting for you to come back, Master."</p><p></p><p>"Let me peel and debone him first."</p><p></p><p>"Okay, I'll start the fire."</p><p></p><p>The master and servant were busy at work.</p><p></p><p>Ye Xiao used his divine craftsmanship to carefully peel off King Aier's skin intact.</p><p></p><p>Since King Aier's skin was that of a divine patriarch star beast, if he were to fuse it with the black scale snake armor, he could definitely forge an even more powerful set of armor.</p><p></p><p>Then there were King Aier's horns. His pair of massive horns were over sixty to seventy centimeters long, and Ye Xiao felt he could forge two excellent imperial-grade short swords from them.</p><p></p><p>And they would be quite impressive imperial-grade short swords at that.</p><p></p><p>Here is the full English translation of the Chinese excerpt:</p><p></p><p>After that was the star core. The star core of the Aer King was very large, bigger than a chicken egg, at least comparable to a duck egg or even a slightly smaller goose egg.</p><p></p><p>These three precious materials should be preserved well.</p><p></p><p>Unfortunately, the Aer King could not use the resurrection technique to exploit the bug, could not repeatedly revive, and then let Ye Xiao peel off a few more skins.</p><p></p><p>Even the supreme healing arts like the Supplementing the Heavens Technique and the Stellar Incantation require a special medium.</p><p></p><p>That is the soul.</p><p></p><p>Only living beings with a soul can be resurrected, and the spiritual energy will attach to the soul body, relying on the soul body to revive.</p><p></p><p>Without a soul, even the mightiest experts cannot achieve resurrection.</p><p></p><p>This is also why Ye Xiao could not revive those two half-beast sect masters who came to capture the Illusory Glazed Jade before, because their souls were completely shattered.</p><p></p><p>But there's no other way.</p><p></p><p>No matter how powerful the healing arts are, they cannot defy the heavens excessively.</p><p></p><p>Otherwise, if anyone uses the resurrection technique to revive all those deceased experts, being able to resurrect them even without a soul, wouldn't that be nonsense?</p><p></p><p>What kind of powerful force would he have to possess?</p><p></p><p>Furthermore, if he didn't shatter the Aer King's soul, the Aer King would keep attacking him.</p><p></p><p>A Deity Sect-level expert would not be as soft-hearted and lacking in ambition as the Illusory Glazed Jade, easily becoming a servant.</p><p></p><p>After properly handling the Aer King and storing the precious materials in the spatial storage, Ye Xiao's gaze fell on the fresh mutton, and the corners of his mouth curled up.</p><p></p><p>Making roasted mutton skewers often requires the freshest and most tender mutton, cutting the mutton into cubes to make mutton cubes, then threading them onto bamboo skewers one by one.</p><p></p><p>It's best to intersperse a piece of fat meat between every two or three pieces of lean meat. This way, during the roasting process, the sheep oil oozing out from the fat meat will be absorbed by the other lean meat, ensuring the tenderness of the lean meat and preventing it from becoming too dry.</p><p></p><p>The next step is to marinate it with oil, salt, sauce, and other seasonings. After marinating, the taste will be more even and first-class.</p><p></p><p>Finally, according to personal taste, after the golden and shiny mutton skewers are roasted, sprinkle some chili powder and cumin appropriately.</p><p></p><p>Biting into the vibrant and appetizing mutton skewers, the rich aroma bursts in the mouth, and with the sheep oil spurting out, an incredibly satisfying feeling rushes to the brain, making it irresistible.</p><p></p><p>Tender, fragrant, salty with a hint of spiciness! If Ye Xiao had neighbors, he could make the neighbor's kids cry with envy.</p><p></p><p>Paired with a glass of ice-cold beer, it's simply blissful.</p><p></p><p>As for the mutton kidneys and other good things, Ye Xiao didn't miss them either, perfectly sending them down his stomach.</p><p></p><p>Then, he turned off his phone, undressed, and went to bed to rest.</p><p></p><p>A day's sleep, that was truly fulfilling.</p><p></p><p>By the time he woke up in the evening, the quilt seemed a bit higher than before.</p><p></p><p>Very good, his body was getting better and better, fantastic! Ye Xiao felt the power within himself, which had increased significantly.</p><p></p><p>After all, he was a Deity Sect-level star beast, and the vitality in his body was too vigorous, helping him to completely stabilize his Deity Sect realm and further improve his cultivation.</p><p></p><p>The battle yesterday also provided him with a lot of help.</p><p></p><p>He originally needed a gradual process to adapt to the rapid advancement of his own cultivation.</p><p></p><p>But with the intense battle, he constantly felt how strong his cultivation had become, so his body and mind had already merged with his cultivation.</p><p></p><p>It directly solved his difficulty in adapting to the drastic changes in his own strength in the short term.</p><p></p><p>Ye Xiao opened his phone and found dozens of missed calls, most of them from Gu Hai. This guy must have gone to the library and, seeing that he was not there, became so anxious and kept calling him.</p><p></p><p>In addition, there was one from the librarian, one from Wang Jie, two from Qin Yuyan, and two from the garrison team, probably because the others couldn't find him and reported it.</p><p></p><p>It seems they all discovered that he was not in the library and were so anxious to call him.</p><p></p><p>Ye Xiao quickly responded to a text message, reporting that he was safe, so that everyone wouldn't worry.</p><p></p><p>The messages from the others soon came back.</p><p></p><p>The librarian: "It's good that you're fine. These days have been unstable, so try to stay in the library and don't go wandering around."</p><p></p><p>Wang Jie: "That's good, that's good. If you had any accidents, our library's little grass would be gone."</p><p></p><p>Qin Yuyan's was the shortest, just four words:</p><p>"It's good that you're fine."</p><p></p><p>As for Gu Hai, Ye Xiao called him back.</p><p></p><p>They had the closest relationship, and Gu Hai had called the most, so he should call back to report that he was safe, rather than just sending a text message.</p><p></p><p>"Hello, old Ye, what's going on? I've been calling you all day, and your phone has been turned off."</p><p></p><p>"My phone was broken, I just fixed it."</p><p></p><p>Ye Xiao casually lied.</p><p></p><p>"Well, as long as you're fine. I was so worried. I just said, yesterday the star beasts didn't really invade, how could you still get into trouble? False alarm. I still have work to do, let's talk later."</p><p></p><p>"Okay."</p><p></p><p>"Boss, forget the fire paper and the doll."</p><p></p><p>Ye Xiao: "(._.)!"</p><p></p><p>This is the second update, 6,000 words.</p><p></p><p>Please vote for monthly tickets, subscribe, and vote for recommendation tickets.</p><p></p><p>Thank you to book friend 20170520102242978 for the reward, I'm very grateful.</p><p></p><p>The initial subscription performance is basically not much different from the previous one. I hope that the upcoming intensive updates will be able to improve it a bit.</p><p></p><p>I still need more progress, and I hope everyone can give more opinions, thank you very much.</p><p></p><p>(This chapter is complete)</p>

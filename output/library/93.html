        <h1>Chapter 93</h1>
        <div class="content">
            <p>Here is the full English translation of the Chinese excerpt:</p><p></p><p>After this force had imprisoned Ning Yuhen, Ning Yuhen immediately fell into a state of utter despair.</p><p></p><p>In this moment, he so hated his own weakness and helplessness! If only he could be as powerful as the legendary big shots of Jianghai City, how wonderful would that be? He did not seek to harm anyone, he only sought the chance to live.</p><p></p><p>The chance to live like the manager, like all ordinary people! Alas, reality is cruel.</p><p></p><p>He knew that his days were numbered, he had already prepared to give up resistance, because he could not resist at all.</p><p></p><p>Weakness is the original sin! Farewell, manager.</p><p>Farewell, colleagues in the library.</p><p>Farewell, this world.</p><p></p><p>But at this moment, Ning Yuhen heard a faint sigh in his ear.</p><p></p><p>Afterwards, the entire air suddenly experienced a violent explosion.</p><p></p><p>After the explosion, the massive force that had confined him instantly dissipated into thin air.</p><p></p><p>"This is..."</p><p></p><p>Ning Yuhen's pupils contracted, and the next moment, Ye Xiao had walked out of the courtyard.</p><p></p><p>"Manager?"</p><p></p><p>At this moment, even if he had a pig's brain, he could vaguely guess something.</p><p></p><p>Just now, the manager had intervened to save him!</p><p></p><p>But the manager's strength, is it not only at the post-heavenly second-grade, and his divine soul has not even been awakened?</p><p></p><p>And the force that just confined him was absolutely, absolutely above the Patriarch realm! The manager, he... he has hidden his cultivation? And he may also be a Patriarch expert? Heavens! How old is the manager? He's not even twenty-one yet.</p><p></p><p>A twenty-year-old Patriarch expert? Is this a joke? This achievement can be 100% called the number one among the younger generation of Jianghai City.</p><p></p><p>No, to put it more exaggeratedly, looking across the entire Central Plain, even the entire Nine Provinces, or even the whole world, the manager's talent is one of the top.</p><p></p><p>Ye Xiao did not bother to respond to him, he was not afraid of exposing his identity to Ning Yuhen, he had countless ways to make Ning Yuhen forget this matter.</p><p></p><p>Moreover, even if Ning Yuhen did not forget, given Ning Yuhen's character and their friendship, Ye Xiao believed he would not expose his identity.</p><p></p><p>He looked up at the sky, and a woman dressed in a long dress, beautifully attired, with six silver-white tails, descended barefoot.</p><p></p><p>Seeing the fox tails of the other party, Ning Yuhen was completely stunned.</p><p></p><p>He could tell with his little toe that he and the other party were of the same race.</p><p></p><p>Silver Fox!</p><p></p><p>"Manager, she is also from the Silver Fox clan. But how come she only has six tails? Fewer than my tails?"</p><p></p><p>Ning Yuhen couldn't help but be puzzled.</p><p></p><p>Ye Xiao then spoke indifferently:</p><p></p><p>"You and her are not the same.</p><p></p><p>You should be a royal of the Silver Fox clan, so after activating your bloodline, you were born with nine tails. While ordinary Silver Fox spirit beasts can only increase the number of tails by cultivating themselves.</p><p></p><p>She already has six tails, which means she is an ordinary Silver Fox, but her cultivation has reached at least the Great Patriarch realm."</p><p></p><p>Ye Xiao had read many strange and wonderful knowledge, his attainments had reached a mind-boggling level.</p><p></p><p>Ning Yuhen was instantly dumbfounded.</p><p></p><p>Great Patriarch level cultivation?</p><p></p><p>What a joke! If that's the case, then the manager just now easily neutralized the other party's power, doesn't that mean the manager is also a Great Patriarch? A twenty-year-old Great Patriarch? He had just thought that Ye Xiao was only a Patriarch, but it turns out Ye Xiao is not a Patriarch, but a Great Patriarch! Then the manager is undoubtedly the number one among the younger generation in the world.</p><p></p><p>Here is the full English translation of the Chinese excerpt:</p><p></p><p>Ah!</p><p></p><p>This manager who is usually low-key and harmless, only knowing how to read books, turns out to be such a powerful existence?</p><p></p><p>At this moment, Ning Yuhen began to doubt the meaning of life. Could it be that the manager is not human?</p><p></p><p>Humans could not possibly be this strong! From the sky above, Youwei slowly descended, her gaze revealing a hint of vigilance, staring intently at Ye Xiao, but putting on a hypocritical smile on her face.</p><p></p><p>"Unexpectedly, there is also a great master here, truly surprising beyond measure."</p><p></p><p>Ye Xiao looked at her with an indifferent gaze.</p><p></p><p>The next moment, the aura of the great master surged forth like a tidal wave, overwhelming everything.</p><p></p><p>Without any superfluous words, nor any intention of exchanging pleasantries.</p><p></p><p>Except for special circumstances, all who have witnessed his hand in action must die.</p><p></p><p>Moreover, the opponent was here to capture Ning Yuhen!</p><p></p><p>Feeling the oppressive force of this aura, Youwei dared not be careless, her expression hardening as she crossed her fingers, immediately mobilizing her spiritual energy and unleashing her martial arts.</p><p></p><p>But before she could activate her technique, the next second, a sword beam had already formed in front of her eyes, growing larger and larger! Boom! The sword beam exploded in the sky, transforming into a dazzling firework, directly reducing Youwei to ashes!</p><p></p><p>Ning Yuhen's face couldn't help but twitch violently.</p><p></p><p>A great master was just slain by the manager's single sword beam? The manager's strength was a bit too unreasonable, wasn't it?</p><p></p><p>Could it be that he has even surpassed the great masters?</p><p></p><p>However, Ning Yuhen had not been shocked too much by this, when in the next moment, Youwei revived in the air, restored to her original state.</p><p></p><p>The only difference was that one of her fox tails was missing.</p><p></p><p>Substitution Technique! The signature divine art of the Silver Fox Clan, the pinnacle of their healing arts!</p><p></p><p>Through cultivation, one can store their life information in their tails. When faced with an attack they cannot resist, the tail will substitute for the body, absorbing the entire attack. But each time the Substitution Technique is used, the tail will lose one segment. To regrow a complete tail may require hundreds of years of effort! If all the tails are lost, the silver fox's life will be extinguished.</p><p></p><p>"Phew! Phew!"</p><p></p><p>Youwei panted heavily, her delicate face as pale as wax.</p><p></p><p>She had not expected that there would be such a powerful existence in Jianghai City.</p><p></p><p>No, she couldn't fight him head-on, or she would surely die!</p><p></p><p>"I..."</p><p></p><p>Just as she was about to plead for mercy, before she could even finish the word "surrender", Ye Xiao unleashed another sword beam, once again blasting her into a mist of blood.</p><p></p><p>After the slaughter was complete, Ye Xiao spoke to the side of Ning Yuhen:</p><p></p><p>"For your Silver Fox Clan's Substitution Technique, each time it is severed, a tail is lost, and a use is lost. So, I need to kill it several times to kill it off."</p><p></p><p>Ning Yuhen nodded, half-understanding.</p><p></p><p>Subsequently, Youwei revived again, and Ning Yuhen immediately pointed to the sky and said, "Manager, look, she has revived again."</p><p></p><p>"I know."</p><p></p><p>With that, Ye Xiao unleashed another sword beam.</p><p></p><p>The dazzling golden light struck again, and Youwei was already in despair, knowing that she could not go on like this.</p><p></p><p>If this continued, even if she had a hundred or a thousand lives, they would not be enough for Ye Xiao to slay.</p><p></p><p>Second update.</p><p></p><p>(Chapter complete)</p>

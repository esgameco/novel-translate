        <h1>Chapter 262</h1>
        <div class="content">
            <p>Here is the full English translation of the excerpt from the Chinese novel:</p><p></p><p>It is not a cultivation technique, but rather a miscellaneous discussion on the topic of cultivation and evolution. Judging from the appearance of the book, it seems to have been written a long time ago.</p><p></p><p>It was likely authored by some relatively elderly martial artists.</p><p></p><p>The content written here is related to the topic of dragon qi.</p><p></p><p>This so-called dragon qi refers to the most essential power that one can obtain from within the dragon vein.</p><p></p><p>Last night, Ye Xiao relied on this power to instantly raise his current cultivation by around 10%.</p><p></p><p>Therefore, he is now extremely interested in this power.</p><p></p><p>He really wants to know what this power is exactly.</p><p></p><p>After opening the book, his eyes were met with an archaic text.</p><p></p><p>Ye Xiao: "(_..)! This damned classical Chinese!" Fortunately, he is now at the King Realm, and when activating the Taixuan Tiangong, his spiritual activity frequency is extremely fast, allowing him to quickly analyze the meaning within.</p><p></p><p>The dragon qi is the fortune of the human race! The fortune of the mountains, rivers, and great waters! It is often born within the dragon veins.</p><p></p><p>If a common person obtains this fortune, they can break through the shackles of the physical body and achieve the Emperor Physique! This so-called Emperor Physique is an existence that transcends the constraints of the rules of time and space.</p><p></p><p>Only by achieving the Emperor Physique can one escape the suppression of the rules of power and continue cultivating further.</p><p></p><p>If one cannot achieve the Emperor Physique, then when their cultivation reaches a certain limit, they will naturally die, even if they use some special methods to maintain it, it would only be a prolonged and miserable existence. Compared to true longevity, it is incomparable.</p><p></p><p>But achieving the Emperor Physique is an extremely difficult feat?</p><p></p><p>The Emperor Physique can easily break free from the constraints of the rules of time and space, its power is unimaginable.</p><p></p><p>For ordinary people to become an Emperor is almost a fantasy.</p><p></p><p>Not to mention a hundred billion people, even if a thousand billion people, having one person achieve it would already be an extremely rare occurrence.</p><p></p><p>Ye Xiao couldn't help but be shocked.</p><p></p><p>If it's according to the proportions mentioned in the book, currently the entire world doesn't even have the qualifications to produce an Emperor Realm expert.</p><p></p><p>It's too difficult.</p><p></p><p>At the same time, his curiosity was also piqued, and he continued reading on.</p><p></p><p>There are two methods to achieve the Emperor Realm.</p><p></p><p>The first method is to awaken the Imperial Bloodline.</p><p></p><p>This is an extremely special bloodline that is not suppressed by the rules of time and space, and even if one breaks through, they will not encounter the Tribulation.</p><p></p><p>Although it is still unknown how this bloodline is born, and its limits and true power are unknown.</p><p></p><p>But as long as it is the Imperial Bloodline, the final cultivation will absolutely not be low.</p><p></p><p>However, the vast majority of people have no chance of possessing the Imperial Bloodline.</p><p></p><p>At this time, some experts have discovered another path. That is to extract the dragon qi from the dragon veins and let themselves possess this special power, to temper their physique, and allow themselves to break through the shackles of the physical body, reaching the true Imperial Bloodline.</p><p></p><p>It is precisely because of this that there was once an Emperor in history who ordered his subordinates to sever all the dragon veins within the Nine Provinces, to prevent future generations from destroying his descendants!</p><p></p><p>Dragon qi is the essence of the creation of heaven and earth. It inherently contains the power of the Dao, and can withstand the Tribulation just like lightning, without being excessively rejected.</p><p></p><p>Only those who obtain the dragon qi can pass the test of the Tribulation during their breakthrough. Even if their physical body is tempered by lightning, they will not perish.</p><p></p><p>Without the protection of dragon qi, no matter how strong your cultivation or talent is, you will ultimately be unable to withstand the overwhelming power of the Tribulation.</p><p></p><p>This thing can be understood as a kind of key.</p><p></p><p>The key that opens the door to the Emperor Realm.</p><p></p><p>Therefore, if one wants to become an Emperor Realm expert, and is not of the Imperial Bloodline, they must absolutely obtain dragon qi, and the more the better.</p><p></p><p>Otherwise, no matter how deeply you cultivate, in the end you will still die.</p><p></p><p>According to the author's conjecture, dragon qi may be more like a catalytic substance.</p><p></p><p>It can catalyze the human body, transforming certain parts of the body to be like the Imperial Bloodline.</p><p></p><p>In this way, even an ordinary person can possess the same powerful strength and aptitude as the Imperial Bloodline, and then break through to the Emperor Realm.</p><p></p><p>This book is only a fragment, and the events after it are not recorded, perhaps damaged by the passage of time, or perhaps its owner simply never wrote them down.</p><p></p><p>But regardless of the outcome, at least Ye Xiao knows one thing - he should go seek out more dragon qi to forge the Emperor Physique.</p><p></p><p>Otherwise, he will be unable to break through that boundary, and naturally will not be able to grow into an Emperor Realm expert.</p><p></p><p>If he can't even reach the Emperor Realm, there's no need to talk about what comes after.</p><p></p><p>But speaking of which, when he obtained the dragon qi, his body did undergo some catalysis.</p><p></p><p>Or rather, if I had to use a word, tempering would be more accurate.</p><p></p><p>It expelled many impurities from his body, leaving behind some extremely powerful blood qi.</p><p></p><p>If the author's conjecture is correct, that dragon qi refines the human body, turning the blood into something akin to the Imperial Bloodline, then doesn't that mean he is the same as Qin Yuyan? Does he also possess the Imperial Bloodline? No, something seems a bit off.</p><p></p><p>The reason the Imperial Bloodline is the Imperial Bloodline is because it must be vastly different from ordinary blood.</p><p></p><p>Otherwise, how could it be distinguished as the Imperial Bloodline?</p><p></p><p>Here is the full English translation of the Chinese excerpt:</p><p></p><p>At this moment, Ye Xiao suddenly thought of the term "divine blood" again.</p><p></p><p>Divine blood was a term he had just recently learned about.</p><p></p><p>It was also the reason behind the star beasts' attack on humanity. According to legend, the human race are the descendants of the divine race, and the divine race is the mightiest race in the universe.</p><p></p><p>Because of this, the human race's inner qi and blood contain divine blood, but it is extremely rare. </p><p></p><p>It might require tens of billions, or even hundreds of billions of humans, to extract it.</p><p></p><p>It can allow divine beasts and super divine beasts to advance further, and can also turn the strongest human Monarch realm cultivators and Emperors into true divine beings.</p><p></p><p>Ye Xiao's heartbeat suddenly started to accelerate. </p><p></p><p>He seemed to have vaguely understood the connection.</p><p></p><p>He had a guess.</p><p></p><p>The imperial bloodline is actually divine blood!</p><p></p><p>In other words, a person who has awakened the imperial bloodline has actually awakened the divine blood.</p><p></p><p>And divine blood will not be targeted by the laws of space-time, so they can continue to break through without encountering tribulations.</p><p></p><p>But ordinary humans do not have this awakened. The blood of the vast majority of people is just ordinary human blood.</p><p></p><p>They need to refine dragon qi to temper their own blood, in order to reach the level of creating divine blood.</p><p></p><p>In this way, ordinary people would also possess the same divine blood as those with the imperial bloodline.</p><p></p><p>Ye Xiao's speculation had some basis.</p><p></p><p>The last time the Tiger God Sect's Su Shan and the others came down to snatch Qin Yuyan, it should be because the imperial bloodline is actually divine blood.</p><p></p><p>Otherwise, why would the star beasts come to capture Qin Yuyan? </p><p></p><p>To fall in love? Or to make a bone broth?</p><p></p><p>Ye Xiao would not believe the star beasts would be so boring.</p><p></p><p>They must be doing this because there is a hidden secret.</p><p></p><p>It's worth a try! Rather than thinking too much, it's better to try it out.</p><p></p><p>Ye Xiao scanned with his divine sense and confirmed Qin Yuyan's location, then immediately activated the divine will technique and teleported to her side.</p><p></p><p>Le Xinlian was in front of her, imparting cultivation knowledge.</p><p></p><p>But Ye Xiao's speed was too fast, the Monarch realm speed was so terrifying that it was beyond the reach of their naked eyes and senses.</p><p></p><p>In an instant, Ye Xiao took a drop of Qin Yuyan's fresh blood, then used a technique to leave again.</p><p></p><p>The entire process took less than 0.00001 seconds, the two of them couldn't keep up with this speed at all.</p><p></p><p>Qin Yuyan touched her chest.</p><p></p><p>"Strange, I feel like something just pricked me just now?"</p><p></p><p>Le Xinlian shook her head.</p><p></p><p>"Did you feel wrong? There's no way there could be mosquitoes here. If something had pricked you, I definitely would have noticed."</p><p></p><p>"That's true. Master Le is a Saint Sovereign level expert, how could anything escape your eyes? If it managed to escape you, it must not be just one person."</p><p></p><p>"Don't be distracted. Listen carefully to my lecture."</p><p></p><p>"Yes!"</p><p></p><p>The two women continued to impart knowledge and study.</p><p></p><p>On the other side, after obtaining Qin Yuyan's fresh blood, Ye Xiao immediately left and came to a deserted area, then also squeezed out a drop of his own fresh blood.</p><p></p><p>He used the Grand Heavenly Dipper technique to scan and compare the two blood samples, scanning over 2,000 times per second!</p><p></p><p>After several screenings, he was finally able to confirm his speculation.</p><p></p><p>In the comparison of their blood, aside from both being human blood, there was one extremely special similarity.</p><p></p><p>Both of their blood had a faint golden glow, which was the state of blood after being refined by dragon qi.</p><p></p><p>The only difference was that Ye Xiao's was very weak, while Qin Yuyan's was very bright and clear.</p><p></p><p>That's right, the imperial bloodline is divine blood!</p><p></p><p>So after the imperial bloodline awakens, one will have a faster cultivation speed.</p><p></p><p>And they won't even suffer from tribulations.</p><p></p><p>I understand now, everything is clear.</p><p></p><p>The reason to seek dragon qi is because this pure natural power can help the human race refine their bloodline, allowing those who cannot awaken it to become divine.</p><p></p><p>But after understanding this, Ye Xiao's heart became grave again.</p><p></p><p>Although the imperial bloodline is very talented, it is not an invincible freak.</p><p></p><p>If the imperial bloodline is indeed divine blood, then Qin Yuyan can only be considered an ordinary person who has awakened divine blood.</p><p></p><p>In the entire starry sky, how many people are there like Qin Yuyan, who have awakened divine blood?</p><p></p><p>What about Xia Bingning? Where does she come from? She said that the place she's from is full of experts.</p><p></p><p>She also has a powerful eye technique.</p><p></p><p>Powerful eye techniques are mostly either innate, obtained through inheritance, or passed down from family elders.</p><p></p><p>Then Xia Bingning's origins are even more worthy of deep thought!</p><p></p><p>Could it be... that under this starry sky, there may be an even more grand and vast world beyond his imagination? </p><p></p><p>The human world may only be a small corner within it?</p>

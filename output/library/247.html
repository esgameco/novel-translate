        <h1>Chapter 247</h1>
        <div class="content">
            <p>Here is the full English translation of the Chinese novel excerpt:</p><p></p><p>Ye Xiao opened the Golden Book, and the three cultivation techniques inside were already showing that they could be combined.</p><p></p><p>Ye Xiao first clicked on the three healing techniques he had already collected, and casually combined them.</p><p></p><p>The divine spirit of the Golden Book immediately began to combine the three cultivation techniques, and a progress bar appeared.</p><p></p><p>It only showed 1% progress.</p><p></p><p>"Starting at just 1%, that's really fast. When I used to combine basic techniques to form imperial techniques, it would take around a night. Now, using imperial techniques to combine new techniques, I wonder how long it will take. </p><p></p><p>Will it be twice as long, or...?"</p><p></p><p>After pondering briefly, Ye Xiao turned his attention back to the sword techniques.</p><p></p><p>He had never combined two techniques simultaneously before.</p><p></p><p>He clicked on it, but there was no response.</p><p></p><p>He clicked again, still no response.</p><p></p><p>Well, it seems impossible to combine two techniques at the same time.</p><p></p><p>He could only combine them one by one.</p><p></p><p>Or rather, each time he combined, he could only combine techniques of the same level.</p><p></p><p>For example, when using regular techniques to combine imperial techniques, he could also use imperial techniques to combine, but he couldn't use one imperial technique to combine while another imperial technique was being combined.</p><p></p><p>But no matter, now that he had reached the King Realm, he could combine them, as long as he could combine them, it wouldn't be a problem.</p><p></p><p>It would just take some time, that's all.</p><p></p><p>Two hours later.</p><p></p><p>Ye Xiao: "(_..)!"</p><p></p><p>Seeing that the progress was still only 1%, Ye Xiao didn't know what to say.</p><p></p><p>Was it stuck? But just then, the progress bar finally changed, reaching 2%.</p><p></p><p>So it wasn't stuck.</p><p></p><p>But it felt even more frustrating.</p><p></p><p>Two hours, and it had only reached 1%. That meant it would take nearly 198 hours to fully combine.</p><p></p><p>That's over a week.</p><p></p><p>Compared to the imperial techniques he could combine in a single night, the time consumed was not just a little bit more, it was about 16 times longer.</p><p></p><p>But thinking about it carefully, this was the combination of an imperial-level technique. Imperial-level techniques were far beyond the level of ordinary techniques.</p><p></p><p>The gap between them was far more than 16 times. Now, using imperial techniques to combine, it only took him 8 days, which was still a great gain.</p><p></p><p>And there was one more thing.</p><p></p><p>The divine spirit of the Golden Book itself was an extremely powerful existence. Since even it required so much time to combine, the power of this technique was not to be questioned.</p><p></p><p>Based on this, Ye Xiao's unhappy mood immediately dissipated, and he was once again filled with anticipation for the new technique.</p><p></p><p>8 days, it's not 8 years.</p><p></p><p>Just wait for it.</p><p></p><p>At this time, several powerful auras were rapidly approaching from the distance, likely experts from the surrounding cities who had heard the news.</p><p></p><p>"It's time to return to the library."</p><p></p><p>Thinking this, Ye Xiao activated the Divine Will Technique and disappeared from the spot.</p><p></p><p>When he reappeared, Ye Xiao was now hundreds of miles west of Jianghai City.</p><p></p><p>Having just broken through to the King Realm, his speed was incredibly fast, almost beyond his control.</p><p></p><p>From the southeast of the Central Plains, the Tiemo Cliff, to this place, he didn't know how many miles he had crossed, but previously it would have taken him over ten breaths to get here.</p><p></p><p>But now, with just a thought, he had arrived directly.</p><p></p><p>He had crossed countless mountains and rivers in the blink of an eye.</p><p></p><p>Truly, the power of the King Realm was extraordinary.</p><p></p><p>Ye Xiao vaguely tested it, and found that with a single thought in the King Realm, he could cover nearly the distance of an entire state, from east to west.</p><p></p><p>Incredibly fast! Absurdly fast!</p><p></p><p>The Nine States were already quite large, sometimes even equivalent to an entire country.</p><p></p><p>For example, states like Yingzhou and Hanzhou were at most the size of one of the Nine States.</p><p></p><p>If Ye Xiao spent a little more time, perhaps just tens of seconds, he could circle the entire world? This speed was already extremely terrifying.</p><p></p><p>After all, the range of this world was about ten times that of the Earth.</p><p></p><p>"In the end, it's a good thing. And now, I'm only using the Divine Will Technique. I wonder what terrifying body techniques I'll have when I fully integrate these techniques?</p><p></p><p>Will my speed surpass even Emperor Realm experts?"</p><p></p><p>Previously, when Ye Xiao had chatted with Beitang Ce, he had clearly heard him say that Emperor Realm experts could reach any corner of the world in an instant.</p><p></p><p>If he could instantly reach any part of the world with just the King Realm, even facing Emperor Realm experts, he wouldn't need to worry too much. </p><p></p><p>At the very least, he could still run away.</p><p></p><p>Of course, Ye Xiao wouldn't be so reckless as to provoke Emperor Realm experts! Unless he himself was also an Emperor Realm expert.</p><p></p><p>With another thought, Ye Xiao returned to his small courtyard in Jianghai City.</p><p></p><p>This time, he didn't use any body techniques, just simply using his own spiritual energy to move, so he could slow down his speed a bit.</p><p></p><p>He estimated he would need to spend some time getting used to his King Realm cultivation.</p><p></p><p>When he just returned, it was already night at his home, but the lights were not on.</p><p></p><p>Here is my translation of the Chinese excerpt:</p><p></p><p>"Strange, where did the silly cat run off to?" </p><p></p><p>Ye Xiao was just about to sweep the area with his mind, when suddenly Huan Liuli came floating in from the distance. </p><p></p><p>She was coming from the direction of the library, so it seemed she had gone to the breeding grounds to collect something.</p><p></p><p>Seeing Ye Xiao had returned, her eyes suddenly lit up.</p><p></p><p>"Master, you're back!"</p><p></p><p>Ye Xiao nodded, and seeing her current cultivation, he couldn't help but praise her:</p><p></p><p>"Not bad, I didn't expect that in the one month I was gone, you've been working so hard and have already reached the realm of a Xiantian Seventh Grade Saint Monarch."</p><p></p><p>Huan Liuli's mouth curled up in a smile, her little tail swaying back and forth behind her.</p><p></p><p>"Hehe, after all, I am the First Defender under the master. Of course my strength has to keep up. Otherwise, wouldn't that be embarrassing for the master?"</p><p></p><p>At this rate, in just a few more months, I should be able to catch up to you, master."</p><p></p><p>Ye Xiao just smiled without responding. Huan Liuli thought he was angry, and quickly said:</p><p></p><p>"Master, please don't be angry! I didn't mean anything by it. I was just joking. Even if I catch up to you, I will still be your most loyal servant."</p><p></p><p>Huan Liuli hurriedly explained herself. After all, she was just a Xiantian Seventh Grade Saint Monarch. If she really angered the master, with just a thought he could slay her.</p><p></p><p>But Ye Xiao didn't say anything, and just with a thought, directly took the storage ring from her hand.</p><p></p><p>Huan Liuli: "(!?)"</p><p></p><p>What just happened? How could she not have sensed his spiritual energy fluctuations at all, and he had already taken the ring? </p><p></p><p>He must have acted without her noticing. </p><p></p><p>But even though the master's strength has reached the peak of Xiantian Ninth Grade, it's still impossible for him to be so godly, right? After all, she is now a Xiantian Seventh Grade Saint Monarch, and even if her strength is lacking, she still shouldn't be unable to sense the master's aura at all.</p><p></p><p>Wait a minute...something seems off.</p><p></p><p>She seems to have recalled something.</p><p></p><p>She remembers the elders of her clan once saying that after breaking through to the Saint Monarch realm, there are even more powerful realms beyond that.</p><p></p><p>If one were to break through to that realm, they would completely transcend Xiantian, becoming like a Grandmaster, already completely beyond the Houtian.</p><p></p><p>Houtian martial artists would not be able to sense the spiritual energy of Xiantian martial artists at all. </p><p></p><p>Similarly, Xiantian martial artists also would not be able to sense the existence of that level, when they release spiritual energy.</p><p></p><p>This means...the master has already reached that legendary, extraordinary realm - the King Realm! Huan Liuli's mind was completely in chaos at this realization.</p><p></p><p>What's going on? When she left, Ye Xiao only had the cultivation of a Saint Monarch peak, but now, in just this short one month, he has actually broken through to the King Realm?</p><p></p><p>Heavens, this is simply too terrifying! Her master, is he even human?</p><p></p><p>"What's wrong with you? Why are you spacing out like that?"</p><p></p><p>Huan Liuli hurriedly waved her hands: </p><p></p><p>"Nothing, nothing, I was just thinking about some private matters."</p><p></p><p>"Alright then, if there's nothing else, I'll go upstairs to rest. You should tidy up the house, it's a bit messy."</p><p></p><p>"Yes, master!"</p><p></p><p>Watching Ye Xiao's retreating back, Huan Liuli's gaze was filled with a complex expression.</p><p></p><p>"Master, just what kind of existence are you? Your talent and speed are simply beyond my imagination. I wonder what kind of legend you will create in the future?"</p><p></p><p>But after a moment, she started to feel happy again.</p><p></p><p>"Ah, the master being stronger is also more beneficial for me. </p><p>With such a powerful master backing me, I'm truly blessed beyond measure.</p><p>I've decided, I must become an even better servant for the master.</p><p>In the future, should I consider feeding him meals or something?</p><p>Oh, I've heard human men really like little babies, maybe I should give the master a few little kittens? The master should like them, right?"</p><p></p><p>Of course, Ye Xiao had no idea about all the thoughts running through Huan Liuli's mind.</p><p></p><p>At this time, he had already started planning his next steps for cultivating.</p><p></p><p>Meanwhile, in the starry sky, accompanied by a spatial distortion, a transmission array quietly opened.</p><p>From the transmission array, two figures slowly stepped out.</p><p></p><p>One was a burly figure wearing a leather coat, with a pair of massive horns on his head.</p><p>The other was a tall, thin figure, with a killing intent permeating his gaze, wearing armor and a robe, with deer antlers on his head, having a unique and distinctive appearance.</p><p></p><p>"Is this the mortal world? I don't sense any powerful existences here. Was Tiger God Lord overly concerned in specially sending us over?"</p><p></p><p>"At the end of the day, it's still that idiot Sai Muer's incompetence. Even until now, there's still no news. </p><p>If it weren't for that, Tiger God Lord wouldn't have had to send us two down here to clean up the mess."</p>

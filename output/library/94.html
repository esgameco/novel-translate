        <h1>Chapter 94</h1>
        <div class="content">
            <p>Here is the full English translation of the Chinese excerpt:</p><p></p><p>In the next second, her body was once again blasted by Ye Xiao on the spot.</p><p></p><p>There was no way around it, Ye Xiao's speed was simply too fast, too fast to even give her a chance to react.</p><p></p><p>The location of her resurrection was fixed, and each of Ye Xiao's attacks would arrive just as she had just resurrected.</p><p></p><p>Soon, Yao Wei resurrected again, but her tail, due to igniting and saving her life, had used up two of them, leaving only the last two.</p><p></p><p>That is to say, if Ye Xiao slays her two more times, she will be completely dead!</p><p></p><p>As expected, the moment she resurrected, Ye Xiao's next attack had already arrived.</p><p></p><p>However, this sword strike did not manage to reach Yao Wei in time, as a bolt of lightning suddenly plummeted from the sky, directly striking the sword beam, instantly tearing Ye Xiao's sword beam apart.</p><p></p><p>Yao Wei heaved a sigh of relief, while Ning Yuhen's face grew tense.</p><p></p><p>Only Ye Xiao's expression remained calm and indifferent, as he simply looked up at the sky without taking any action.</p><p></p><p>Before long, a silver beam slowly descended beside Yao Wei.</p><p></p><p>It was a female figure, ethereal and dreamlike, with silver hair and a noble, inviolable aura.</p><p></p><p>Seeing the other party, Yao Wei immediately bowed in salute.</p><p></p><p>"Yao Wei pays respects to the Vixen Queen."</p><p></p><p>Ning Yuhen whispered in front of Ye Xiao:</p><p></p><p>"Master, it is the Vixen Queen of the Silver Fox Clan!"</p><p></p><p>"Mm."</p><p></p><p>Ye Xiao responded with a light hum.</p><p></p><p>Ning Yuhen couldn't help but furrow his brows.</p><p></p><p>Is the master being too calm and composed? That is the Vixen Queen of the Silver Fox Clan, not just some random fox spirit! She is a super expert! Although Ning Yuhen didn't know how strong she was, she was definitely more than just a Grand Master. Is the master being too arrogant?</p><p></p><p>However, he did not know that Ye Xiao's Taixuan Tiangong had already thoroughly investigated her.</p><p></p><p>The one who had come was only a soul projection, just like the soul projection of the Aer King that had previously controlled Ning Yuhen.</p><p></p><p>The power that her true body could exert was only that of a pre-Heavenly Sixth-Grade Grand Master.</p><p></p><p>Although Ye Xiao's cultivation was only at the pre-Heavenly Fifth-Grade, he had cultivated the Taixuan Tiangong, and his spiritual power far exceeded that of the pre-Heavenly Fifth-Grade, plus he had already comprehended the Dao of the pre-Heavenly Sixth-Grade, so he was not afraid of her at all.</p><p></p><p>Moreover, Ye Xiao was also aware that her true body dared not come to Earth.</p><p></p><p>The super experts on the Star Battlefield were not to be trifled with.</p><p></p><p>The Vixen Queen glanced at Yao Wei, then shifted her gaze to Ye Xiao.</p><p></p><p>"Sir, your skills are impressive. Yao Wei is the most talented of my handmaidens, a pre-Heavenly Fifth-Grade Grand Master, yet she cannot even unleash her techniques against you. However, Yao Wei and you have no enmity. Your hand was too ruthless in cutting off three of her tails, a bit excessive, don't you think?"</p><p></p><p>Ye Xiao replied calmly:</p><p></p><p>"Trespassing on human territory is already a violation of the human race. And she even intended to harm my junior brother, so I could not just stand by and watch."</p><p></p><p>Yao Wei hurriedly spoke up:</p><p></p><p>"I never intended to harm him! I only wanted to bring him back to the Silver Fox Clan to protect him. He is the royal of our Silver Fox Clan, the Vixen Queen's own grandnephew. Even if I had a thousand lives, I would not dare to kill him!"</p><p></p><p>The Vixen Queen glanced at Ye Xiao.</p><p></p><p>"Did you hear that, sir?"</p><p></p><p>"Oh."</p><p></p><p>Ye Xiao responded with a single word, immediately infuriating Yao Wei.</p><p></p><p>"You made me lose four tails, four lives, and you just give me an 'oh'?"</p><p></p><p>Boom! The moment Yao Wei's words fell, Ye Xiao struck out with a sword again.</p><p></p><p>This sword strike was so abrupt that Yao Wei, the Vixen Queen, and even Ning Yuhen had not anticipated it.</p><p></p><p>Here is my translation of the Chinese excerpt:</p><p></p><p>Unexpectedly, the young vixen was struck down again, and when she revived, she only had one tail left.</p><p></p><p>"Now, you only have one tail left," Ye Xiao said indifferently, his emotionless words causing the young vixen to shiver in fear, no longer daring to say a word.</p><p></p><p>She now only had one life left, and if Ye Xiao were to strike her down again, she would be completely destroyed.</p><p></p><p>The Vixen Queen narrowed her eyes slightly, staring intently at the young human before her. </p><p></p><p>Since when did humans produce such an outstanding, incredibly powerful, and decisive genius? Ye Xiao had left the Vixen Queen of the mighty Silver Fox Clan feeling amazed.</p><p></p><p>Could it be that a human emperor who dominates the stars and rules over the countless galaxies is about to emerge?</p><p></p><p>After a long pause, she spoke again, her tone noticeably softened.</p><p></p><p>"I apologize to you on behalf of the young vixen's recklessness."</p><p></p><p>Ning Yutian's eyes were filled with admiration as he looked at Ye Xiao.</p><p></p><p>"The boss is simply amazing! YYDS (the best)!"</p><p></p><p>Ye Xiao did not respond, and the Vixen Queen continued:</p><p></p><p>"This time, the young vixen came only to bring my grandson back. She had no other ill intentions. </p><p></p><p>His bloodline has already been activated, and from now on, it will only deepen, until he completely transforms into a star beast.</p><p></p><p>Although your cultivation is strong, you may not be able to keep him here.</p><p></p><p>The human heart is the most narrow-minded and cannot tolerate outsiders.</p><p></p><p>If you are willing to release my Silver Fox Clan's bloodline, my clan is willing to repay you with the healing imperial art from our bloodline - the Chenxing Incantation."</p><p></p><p>Ye Xiao's eyes flickered.</p><p></p><p>It wasn't that he was interested in their technique, but the Vixen Queen was right - Ning Yutian had already revealed his star beast identity, and from now on, he would not be able to stay in the human world.</p><p></p><p>Otherwise, he would either be killed or captured for experiments.</p><p></p><p>Rather than that, it would be better for him to leave the human world.</p><p></p><p>But this was Ning Yutian's decision to make!</p><p></p><p>"I'm not interested in the technique you mentioned. If Ning Yutian wants to go with you, I won't stop him. But if he doesn't want to, then today, no one is taking him away."</p><p></p><p>Ning Yutian's heart trembled, and his eyes became slightly moist.</p><p></p><p>Ye Xiao's consideration for him was truly unparalleled.</p><p></p><p>But he couldn't just think about his own wishes and disregard Ye Xiao's safety.</p><p></p><p>Once he was found, he would undoubtedly bring trouble to Ye Xiao.</p><p></p><p>Furthermore, his grandmother was the Vixen Queen, so she probably wouldn't kill him, right?</p><p></p><p>So, after taking a deep breath, he said to the Vixen Queen with a serious expression, "Okay, I'll go with you. But you have to teach that imperial art to Manager Ye."</p><p></p><p>The Vixen Queen smiled slightly, not looking at Ning Yutian, but at Ye Xiao, knowing that the decision was in Ye Xiao's hands.</p><p></p><p>Ye Xiao looked at Ning Yutian.</p><p></p><p>"Think it through carefully, don't force yourself."</p><p></p><p>Ning Yutian nodded solemnly.</p><p></p><p>"I've thought it through. I can't stay in the human world anymore, I can only go to the Silver Fox Clan. But don't worry, Manager Ye, even though my bloodline will fully awaken and I may become a pure star beast, I will never harm humans."</p>

        <h1>Chapter 223</h1>
        <div class="content">
            <p>Here is the full English translation of the Chinese excerpt:</p><p></p><p>The art of physiognomy is just a very simple and ordinary ocular technique, with a very low level of mastery, and a low entry threshold. Of course, the effect is also low! But there's a saying that goes, "The sword in the hands of the weak can still defeat the small pebble in the hands of the expert."</p><p></p><p>So, no matter how trashy the art of physiognomy is, it depends on who is using it.</p><p></p><p>If it's someone else, then it's truly trash.</p><p></p><p>But Ye Xiao's cultivation has already reached the realm of the Innate Ninth Grade. With such powerful abilities, even a small technique like this can produce extraordinary effects.</p><p></p><p>When he was by the bedside, practicing the ocular technique, the next moment, he saw that on the buildings of the entire Central State City, there were auras of varying strengths floating about.</p><p></p><p>Some people had auras as powerful as a dragon, as massive as a mountain.</p><p></p><p>Some people's auras were a bit weaker, strong like a white rainbow, forming a streak in the sky.</p><p></p><p>And some were pitifully weak, almost negligible, like a strand of hair.</p><p></p><p>Those were mostly children, because they had never cultivated before, so the spiritual energy in their bodies was very scarce.</p><p></p><p>Apart from that, there were also some that were rather special, some were dark red or black in color.</p><p></p><p>Those were most likely not good things.</p><p></p><p>But Ye Xiao was not a savior, and he couldn't go find them one by one.</p><p></p><p>Moreover, to judge a living being as good or bad based solely on physiognomy? Ye Xiao felt that would be a bit too arbitrary.</p><p></p><p>However, it must be said that the ocular technique is quite useful, combining spiritual power exploration, physical attacks, and illusory techniques and so on.</p><p></p><p>The art of physiognomy is far inferior to the Supreme Mystery Heaven Gaze, merely because it is an ordinary technique, and not a synthesized imperial-level ocular technique!</p><p></p><p>But the Golden Book can be used to synthesize ocular techniques, and as long as he learns more basic ocular techniques in the future, he can synthesize an imperial-level ocular technique, which would be sufficient.</p><p></p><p>From the reflection in the mirror, Ye Xiao saw that the pupils of his eyes had completely turned from black to golden.</p><p></p><p>This was similar to that Xia Bingyan's method, where using it would also change the color of the eyes.</p><p></p><p>Just then, his doorbell rang.</p><p></p><p>Ye Xiao glanced over, this aura should be Yang Qian's.</p><p></p><p>He put away the ocular technique and went to open the door.</p><p></p><p>"Manager."</p><p></p><p>Yang Qian had already taken a shower and changed into a pale blue dress.</p><p></p><p>Well, this woman does look better in a dress.</p><p></p><p>Yang Qian's foundation was not bad, definitely not as good as Qin Yueyan's, but she could still be considered a nine-out-of-ten beauty.</p><p></p><p>However, she usually dressed too masculinely, so there was no particular feeling.</p><p></p><p>Today, suddenly wearing a dress, it was a bit dazzling, adding a touch of the gentleness that a lady should have.</p><p></p><p>"What's the matter?" Ye Xiao asked indifferently.</p><p></p><p>Yang Qian bit her lip and gathered her courage to speak:</p><p></p><p>"Manager, I still want to thank you for today's matter!"</p><p></p><p>"I said, you don't need to thank me, it was just a small thing."</p><p></p><p>"But if you hadn't gone to rescue us, we might have been reported to the Library, and after going back, we might have been punished, or even possibly dismissed.</p><p></p><p>By the way, there's a Western restaurant nearby that's quite famous, I'd like to treat you to a meal."</p><p></p><p>"Western food, huh?"</p><p></p><p>Ye Xiao pondered for a moment.</p><p></p><p>"Western food is not necessary, it may seem high-end, but it's actually very monotonous and uninteresting. I prefer to eat the cuisine of our Nine States, even if it's just some small snacks. They're better than Western food.</p><p></p><p>If you really want to treat me to a meal, why don't we go out and have some authentic snacks from the Central State City?"</p><p></p><p>"Okay!"</p><p></p><p>Yang Qian actually didn't like Western food either, but when inviting someone to a meal, she didn't feel comfortable going to a roadside stall.</p><p></p><p>Unexpectedly, Ye Xiao took the initiative to speak up, so it was a good opportunity to go along with it.</p><p></p><p>The two of them went out to the street and found a snack street, sampling some delicious snacks.</p><p></p><p>Just strolling around, a little over two hours had passed.</p><p></p><p>"Manager, look, my belly has been fattened up by you."</p><p></p><p>Yang Qian pointed to her small belly, which had become plump and round.</p><p></p><p>She had thought that when Ye Xiao came to the snack street, he might just politely go through the motions, and not eat too much.</p><p></p><p>But unexpectedly, he ate from start to finish, not missing out on anything - fried, stir-fried, boiled, fried, cold, hot, sour, sweet, he didn't leave a single thing.</p><p></p><p>As a result, she had been eaten into the shape of a six-month pregnant woman, round and plump, like a giant panda.</p><p></p><p>But for some reason, the manager's belly had never changed at all? The manager had eaten much more than her, but his belly remained perfectly fine, still in good shape.</p><p></p><p>This left Yang Qian feeling very puzzled.</p><p></p><p>Ye Xiao spoke indifferently:</p><p></p><p>"That sentence of yours is a bit lacking in conscience. If it weren't for me, could you have picked out the delicious ones yourself?</p><p>Many things, I could tell at a glance whether they were good or not, saving you a lot of money."</p><p></p><p>Yang Qian nodded.</p><p></p><p>The manager's words were not wrong.</p><p></p><p>"The street has been walked through, so we should head back now. We still have training and further studies to attend to tomorrow."</p><p></p><p>Ye Xiao nodded.</p><p></p><p>"Yes, it's time to go back and rest."</p><p></p><p>The two of them prepared to walk back, following the route they had come.</p><p></p><p>At this time, it was already very late, around past 11 o'clock at night, and the street was empty, with not a single person around.</p><p></p><p>There was a vague sense of eeriness.</p><p></p><p>The two of them quickly headed towards the booked hotel.</p><p></p><p>But soon, a scream came from ahead.</p><p></p><p>"Ahâ€”!"</p><p></p><p>It was a woman's shrill scream.</p><p></p><p>Here is the full English translation of the Chinese excerpt:</p><p></p><p>Yang Qian's eyes narrowed, and she immediately strode over in large steps.</p><p></p><p>Ye Xiao inconspicuously scanned with the Taixuan Tiangong, and immediately understood the situation.</p><p></p><p>There was a Hu Chang (a type of demonic beast) harming people.</p><p></p><p>Previously, that defense team member had said there have been many missing person cases in the Central Plains recently, it seems they are related to this.</p><p></p><p>At this moment, Yang Qian had arrived in front of that small alley.</p><p></p><p>But just then, when she clearly saw the other person's face, she suddenly paused.</p><p></p><p>"Song Xiaoyan! What are you doing here? What are you doing?"</p><p></p><p>Yang Qian couldn't help but exclaim. At this time, Ye Xiao had also arrived behind her.</p><p></p><p>Seeing the other party, and then seeing the expressions on both sides, he more or less understood some of it.</p><p></p><p>If there were no accidents, Song Xiaoyan should be Yang Qian's old classmate, and the price she paid to return to the human world was most likely becoming a Hu Chang.</p><p></p><p>Otherwise, relying solely on her own strength, there was absolutely no hope of escaping from the mouth of the Star Beast. After all, the Star Beasts were merciless killers.</p><p></p><p>Song Xiaoyan also saw Yang Qian, and a trace of panic flashed in her eyes.</p><p></p><p>But very soon, her expression became solemn.</p><p></p><p>"What I do is none of your business."</p><p></p><p>Yang Qian's face turned cold.</p><p></p><p>"What you do may not be my business, but if you harm others, I absolutely cannot allow it. Release her!"</p><p></p><p>Song Xiaoyan snorted lightly.</p><p></p><p>"Don't pretend to be a good person, this woman owes me money, so I'm going to catch her. If you keep interfering, don't blame me for not being polite to you."</p><p></p><p>The woman was also a cultivator of the martial way, and after struggling a bit, she immediately shouted loudly:</p><p></p><p>"I don't know her, I don't owe her any money at all. Please, please save me!"</p><p></p><p>Song Xiaoyan's eyes turned cold, and she immediately pressed her down even harder.</p><p></p><p>"On the verge of death, you still stubbornly refuse. Aren't you tired of living?"</p><p></p><p>With that, she struck the woman unconscious with a palm.</p><p></p><p>Yang Qian sneered, "Even if she really did something wrong, that's the defense team's business, you have no right to arrest her."</p><p></p><p>Song Xiaoyan had obviously lost her patience.</p><p></p><p>"I see you're looking for trouble. Da Wen, Xiao Wen, come out and subdue her!"</p><p></p><p>"Yes!"</p><p></p><p>With a brief order from Song Xiaoyan, the next moment, the two martial artists beside her instantly rushed towards Yang Qian at the fastest speed.</p><p></p><p>Yang Qian's face tightened, and with a heavy stomp of her foot, her body suddenly leapt high into the air.</p><p></p><p>She swung her leg in a sweeping attack, directly sweeping the two people away! The shocking force made Song Xiaoyan's face turn cold, only then did she remember that Yang Qian's cultivation was much higher than theirs.</p><p></p><p>"Hmph! You're just lucky." Song Xiaoyan spat, and immediately prepared to flee.</p><p></p><p>But at this moment, an unexpected event occurred again.</p><p></p><p>From the darkness, a figure in a black robe slowly walked out, emitting a cackling laughter.</p><p></p><p>"Hahaha, Song Xiaoyan, isn't this a very powerful martial artist? Why don't you catch her? Are you trying to escape instead?"</p><p></p><p>Song Xiaoyan's body trembled instantly, and she didn't dare to move at all.</p><p></p><p>"Black Snake Lord, this subordinate was just worried that I wouldn't be able to defeat her, and she would capture and torture me, exposing our plan."</p><p></p><p>The Black Snake swept a glance at her, and the snake's tongue in his mouth hissed twice, emitting a strange sound.</p><p></p><p>The next moment, he directly punched out, heavily landing on Song Xiaoyan's chest.</p><p></p><p>Boom! In an instant, Song Xiaoyan was blasted away, falling at Yang Qian's feet.</p><p></p><p>"Do you really think I didn't see through it? Today, you deliberately provoked her, wanting her to stay away from the KTV, away from the bars. Now you want to run? </p><p></p><p>Do you think I'm blind? Or do you think I'm a fool?"</p><p></p><p>Hearing these words, Yang Qian's mind was in turmoil.</p><p></p><p>It turned out that Song Xiaoyan's confrontation with her today was actually to save her! She didn't know, and had fought fiercely with the other party.</p><p></p><p>And now, Song Xiaoyan had been seriously injured by her superior!</p><p></p><p>She quickly walked over and held the heavily injured Song Xiaoyan in her arms.</p><p></p><p>"Xiaoyan, why didn't you tell me? Why did you hide it from me?"</p><p></p><p>Song Xiaoyan coughed up a mouthful of fresh blood and chuckled.</p><p></p><p>"I've become a Hu Chang, such a shameful thing, how could I have the face to tell you?"</p><p></p><p>"I'll take you to the hospital right away."</p><p></p><p>"It's too late, my heart has been crushed. I'm only relying on my strong cultivation to hold on for these two minutes. You have to leave quickly, quickly spread the news about them.</p><p></p><p>Over the years, the Star Beasts have captured many human beings and turned them into Hu Changs, then transported them to human cities! They have an evil plan, to wipe out all human beings when the next beast disaster opens!"</p><p></p><p>On the verge of death, Xiaoyan also lost control.</p><p></p><p>This is the end of the first update, thank you for the support of the Patron Eternal Night Heavenly Dust!</p><p></p><p>I previously wrote that Yang Qian and the others pretended to be Ye Xiao's wife to have him go to the police station to pick someone up, and some readers said it was toxic, so I changed it to his cousin.</p><p></p><p>I just wanted to be funny, but it seems it wasn't suitable, and I won't write like that in the future.</p><p></p><p>I'm really sorry.</p><p></p><p>If there are any toxic parts, please let me know, I will read every comment and modify accordingly based on the situation.</p><p></p><p>I can't perfectly grasp which parts are toxic at once, so I hope everyone will supervise and urge me, and not just leave after seeing it.  I really cherish and value every reader.</p><p></p><p>I've also corrected the typos, mainly because I updated too much and my eyes got tired from looking at the computer for a long time.</p><p></p><p>Thank you all!</p><p></p><p>(This chapter is complete)</p>

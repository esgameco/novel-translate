        <h1>Chapter 221</h1>
        <div class="content">
            <p>Here is the full English translation of the Chinese excerpt:</p><p></p><p>If the library in Jianghai City could be managed this well, I wouldn't need to consider going elsewhere.</p><p></p><p>I'll just stay here at the Jianghai City library until I've completely synthesized the Imperial Art, which would be very comfortable.</p><p></p><p>For now, I'll come here and take a look first.</p><p></p><p>Ye Xiao quickly got his library card, but one slightly regrettable thing was that since he was an outsider, although he had obtained the library card, he could only read books on the lower three floors, and couldn't easily access the upper floors of the library.</p><p></p><p>Ye Xiao didn't mind, as long as he could find suitable cultivation methods and imprint them onto the Divine Tome, then synthesize the Imperial Art to greatly enhance his own strength.</p><p></p><p>He read very quickly. As long as he picked up a book and scanned through it, he could basically judge all the cultivation methods inside, whether they could be accepted by the Divine Tome.</p><p></p><p>If all of Ye Xiao's cultivation methods were just missing the final one, the Divine Tome would violently pulsate to remind him. If there wasn't a final method, it wouldn't give any reminder.</p><p></p><p>This was one of Ye Xiao's constant headaches.</p><p></p><p>However, even so, Ye Xiao was now much more convenient than before. Many cultivation methods no longer needed to be read, such as fist techniques, blade techniques, and sword techniques, as they had already been fused into the Imperial Art, so their basic methods would not be recorded again, and reading them would be a waste.</p><p></p><p>What Ye Xiao needed to read now were just the soul cultivation methods and leg techniques. </p><p></p><p>In addition to these, Ye Xiao would also take the opportunity to supplement some martial arts knowledge, as he didn't know if the Jianghai City Martial Arts Library would introduce these things in the future. Being able to understand them in advance could provide better guidance for his future martial arts path.</p><p></p><p>In the martial arts libraries of the Central State, the martial arts knowledge Ye Xiao found in some books really opened his eyes.</p><p></p><p>For example, Eye Techniques! When he previously encountered Xia Bingning, Ye Xiao had always been very interested in her eyes.</p><p></p><p>That kind of attack that could be directly launched with the eyes, with extremely fast speed and undefendable, was something Ye Xiao really wanted to learn.</p><p></p><p>To use as a lethal technique in battle, it would definitely be very useful! He opened a book that described Eye Techniques.</p><p></p><p>"Eye Techniques, as the name suggests, are techniques that are released through the eyes.</p><p></p><p>The main principle behind Eye Techniques seems to be related to the divine soul.</p><p></p><p>The probability of their appearance is extremely small, and they can only be found in a few special bloodlines.</p><p></p><p>Of course, in addition to being innately formed in special bloodlines, there are also certain methods to cultivate Eye Techniques afterwards. </p><p></p><p>But the Eye Techniques cultivated afterwards are far from being able to compare to those with innate divine eyes. They can never reach the heights of those born with divine eyes.</p><p></p><p>It can even be said that the Eye Techniques they cultivate are the trash of the trash, at most only capable of being some small auxiliary tricks.</p><p></p><p>For example, the Divination Technique, which can be used to observe the cultivation level of the enemy or monitor their movements. </p><p></p><p>But this Divination Technique can only see those weaker than oneself or roughly at the same level. If the opponent's strength is far greater, the Eye Technique becomes completely ineffective.</p><p></p><p>As for other things like illusion techniques or attack techniques, the principle is the same. </p><p></p><p>Strong can deal with the opponent, weak can do nothing.</p><p></p><p>So for this reason, there are not many Eye Techniques in the world. The most inferior techniques are basically useless, and the vast majority are top-tier techniques, and this so-called vast majority are all corresponding to a single martial dao.</p><p></p><p>Their number is even much less than that of soul cultivation methods.</p><p></p><p>They are the rarity among the rarities.</p><p></p><p>However, obtaining an innate divine eye is difficult.</p><p></p><p>According to the current records, about one in two hundred billion people may give birth to a child with inherent eye power.</p><p></p><p>In other words, not many people with innate divine eyes have appeared in human history.</p><p></p><p>But this does not mean that humans can never possess powerful Eye Techniques.</p><p></p><p>The eye power of those born with divine eyes can be stolen.</p><p></p><p>Once stolen, the other party will possess their eye power.</p><p></p><p>Or, when they feel they are about to die, they may pass on their divine eyes to their descendants."</p><p></p><p>After reading all this, Ye Xiao felt somewhat pensive.</p><p></p><p>It seems that Xia Bingning is really a bit different! </p><p></p><p>Her eye power is very strong, at the innate eighth-grade level, she can already fight two star beasts of the same level as herself, which shows that she is either born with a divine eye, or she has inherited it from her ancestors, or even possibly stolen someone else's eye power.</p><p></p><p>But no matter what, her growth potential must be very strong, it's just a matter of how far she can reach.</p><p></p><p>In the future, if he encounters her again, he doesn't know if he'll be able to defeat her again.</p><p></p><p>Shaking his head, Ye Xiao put down the first book that recorded the Eye Techniques, and then went to look at a cultivation method related to Eye Techniques.</p><p></p><p>This was a Divination Technique. </p><p></p><p>It was through tempering the eye power, allowing one's eyes to easily see the opponent's cultivation level when using the technique.</p><p></p><p>It could also see the opponent's...</p><p></p><p>Here is my translation of the Chinese excerpt you provided:</p><p></p><p>The hidden figure's location.</p><p></p><p>Ye Xiao felt that compared to the Taixuan Tiangong, it was definitely not up to par, and it might not even be able to match the perceptual power he had developed after advancing to the Xiantian Ninth Rank.</p><p></p><p>However, Ye Xiao wanted to try whether it could be synthesized. If it could be synthesized, even if he did not have a natural divine eye, he should be able to forge powerful eye techniques.</p><p></p><p>Five minutes later, Ye Xiao closed the book, his heartbeat slightly accelerated.</p><p></p><p>The corners of his mouth couldn't help but rise slightly.</p><p></p><p>Success!</p><p></p><p>This divination technique has been incorporated into his Golden Book Shen Hun, which means the Golden Book Shen Hun can synthesize imperial-level eye techniques.</p><p></p><p>It seems he has the prospect of cultivating this powerful technique.</p><p></p><p>Very perfect!</p><p></p><p>Although he has only found one book so far, and because eye techniques are relatively rare throughout the Nine Provinces, they are not that easy to find.</p><p></p><p>But with a start, there is hope for the future.</p><p></p><p>Take it slowly.</p><p></p><p>After all, he also has other martial dao by his side, it's not like he has to have this thing to get by. He just wants to cultivate another powerful life-saving method.</p><p></p><p>However, just as Ye Xiao was about to continue searching for eye technique manuals, his phone rang.</p><p></p><p>"Hello? Hello?"</p><p></p><p>"Hello? Hello, this is the Sword Emperor Qinglong, ranked first on the World Dragon Ranking. I am now slaying star beasts in the Atlantic Ocean, bravely fighting to protect humanity.</p><p></p><p>But I don't have money to buy a boat ticket back to the Nine Provinces now, so I hope you can help me by transferring 200 yuan to my account XXXX.</p><p></p><p>After I return to the Nine Provinces, I will give you 10 million as a reward, and I will also accept you as my personal disciple, guiding and assisting you to become a powerful cultivator of the Divine Sect!"</p><p></p><p>"Bullshit!"</p><p></p><p>Ye Xiao directly hung up the phone.</p><p></p><p>But the next second, his phone rang again.</p><p></p><p>This time the phone number was a bit different, so Ye Xiao answered again.</p><p></p><p>"Hello, this is the Central State City Defense Force."</p><p></p><p>"Bullshit!"</p><p></p><p>Ye Xiao hung up again.</p><p></p><p>However, the phone soon rang again.</p><p></p><p>"Hello, this is the Central State Defense Force. Your cousin and your cousin's family members were involved in a brawl and have been detained by us."</p><p></p><p>"Bullshit!"</p><p></p><p>Ye Xiao hung up the phone again.</p><p></p><p>Joking, when did this golden bachelor have a cousin? And his cousin was involved in a brawl? Even if he had a cousin, at most it would be his cousin beating up others, there's no way they would be the ones detained by the defense force.</p><p></p><p>Ye Xiao had worked so hard to cultivate his strength, if he were to find a cousin, it would have to be a super expert, right? Trash is definitely not something he would want.</p><p></p><p>But speaking of which, he had just arrived in Central State today!</p><p></p><p>How come in the blink of an eye, there were so many fraud calls?</p><p></p><p>Ye Xiao vaguely felt that something was not quite right.</p><p></p><p>He took out his phone again and compared it, and also searched the web.</p><p></p><p>Seeing the phone numbers noted on the web page, Ye Xiao's brows furrowed deeply.</p><p></p><p>At this moment, the phone rang again.</p><p></p><p>"Hey! What's wrong with you? Every time you just hang up the phone without letting me finish. Do you think I won't come arrest you in my car?"</p><p></p><p>Ye Xiao: "(_..)!"</p><p></p><p>He cleared his throat and then spoke:</p><p></p><p>"Sorry. I just received a fraud call and thought you might be the same."</p><p></p><p>"Alright, don't waste time with me. Come to our Central State Defense Force quickly, your cousin and your uncle and aunt are waiting for you."</p><p></p><p>"Okay, I'll be there soon."</p><p></p><p>Ye Xiao hung up the phone, feeling a bit helpless.</p><p></p><p>He had already guessed the situation.</p><p></p><p>It was most likely Yang Qian and his other colleagues.</p><p></p><p>But they really were scumbags! How come they were arrested by the police when they were just going out to play? Speaking of which, his people really were all unreliable.</p><p></p><p>First it was Gu Hai, who used to pretend to be his son and have Ye Xiao go to the defense force to pick him up because of the Red Waves incident.</p><p></p><p>Then it was Ning Yuhen, who caused trouble, but that time Ning Yuhen was standing up for Ye Xiao, so strictly speaking, it couldn't be counted as him wanting to cause trouble.</p><p></p><p>And now Yang Qian was arrested by the defense force for fighting, and she even pretended to be Ye Xiao's cousin.</p><p></p><p>And not only that, but the other colleagues also got involved. This left Ye Xiao very puzzled.</p><p></p><p>Why is it that there are always so many weirdos around him? Other people's teammates are either invincible big shots that never come out, or once-in-a-millennium geniuses.</p><p></p><p>While his are all a bunch of scumbags.</p><p></p><p>Regarding this, Ye Xiao could only say that it was very wise of him not to reveal his identity. </p><p></p><p>If he had revealed his identity, he doesn't know how much he would be dragged down by them now.</p><p></p><p>Twenty minutes later, in the interrogation room of the defense force, he saw Yang Qian and the other colleagues.</p>

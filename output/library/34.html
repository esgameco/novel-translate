        <h1>Chapter 34</h1>
        <div class="content">
            <p>Here is the full English translation of the Chinese excerpt:</p><p></p><p>"Hello."</p><p></p><p>Ye Xiao simply greeted him, and he clearly saw the other party's throat move slightly when they saw his face.</p><p></p><p>Another shallow woman.</p><p></p><p>"Are you the one renting my house?"</p><p></p><p>Ye Xiao nodded.</p><p></p><p>The other party looked him up and down, and her gaze softened a lot.</p><p></p><p>"The young man is quite handsome."</p><p></p><p>"It's just a courtesy, what's the matter so late at night?"</p><p></p><p>"It's nothing, I just want to tell you that the agent made a mistake on the rent, and you need to pay more rent."</p><p></p><p>Ye Xiao's face was indifferent: "The rent has already been paid to the agent, and a contract has been signed. If you want to raise the rent, let the agent come and talk to me."</p><p></p><p>The landlady put one hand on her waist and said arrogantly:</p><p></p><p>"I'm talking to you directly, you're renting my house, what do I need to talk to the agent for? You have to give me more rent, otherwise you have to pack up and leave.</p><p></p><p>Of course, you don't have to leave, if you don't leave, I'll follow you every day, wherever you go, I'll make sure you can't even go to work."</p><p></p><p>A cold light flashed in Ye Xiao's eyes.</p><p></p><p>This woman was clearly being unreasonable.</p><p></p><p>Previously, this house was haunted, and she couldn't rent it out, and now seeing that he was living well, it meant that there were no ghosts, or the ghosts had already left, so she directly came to raise the price.</p><p></p><p>Perhaps the previous price of 100 yuan per month was just to attract people to come and test her.</p><p></p><p>It's simply not treating others' lives as lives.</p><p></p><p>The landlady saw that he didn't speak, and she leaned towards him, extending her delicate hand, trying to pat Ye Xiao's chest.</p><p></p><p>A strong fragrance of Chanel filled the air, causing Ye Xiao's brow to rise slightly, and he immediately stepped back, causing the fat woman to miss, a trace of displeasure flashing across her face, but she quickly put on a lecherous smile again.</p><p></p><p>"If you don't want to raise the price, that's fine too. Sister has money and doesn't lack these few pennies, come in and have a cup of tea with Sister, and we'll talk it over."</p><p></p><p>Ye Xiao's face was indifferent and he said calmly:</p><p></p><p>"Then come in."</p><p></p><p>With that, he turned and walked into the house.</p><p></p><p>"Okay, okay, Sister is coming."</p><p></p><p>The landlady hurriedly walked into the courtyard, her face beaming with joy, then closed the big door and locked it from the inside.</p><p></p><p>"Little darling, Sister is here~."</p><p></p><p>She swayed her waist, rubbing her delicate hands, and sneakily rushed into the room.</p><p></p><p>Boom! In an instant, her mind seemed to have suffered a heavy blow, and many memories she had never had before were like sparks of electricity, frantically running wild in her mind, sprouting.</p><p></p><p>Looking at Ye Xiao's back, she knelt down on the ground with a "thud".</p><p></p><p>"Sir, I was wrong!"</p><p></p><p>Ye Xiao's face was cold, but in his heart, he couldn't help but marvel.</p><p></p><p>The just-synthesized Taixuan Tiangong was really so useful.</p><p></p><p>For a landlady like this, who had awakened a trash divine soul and had a cultivation of only post-heaven third-grade warrior, he could directly rewrite and implant some memories, making her unconsciously speak her hometown dialect.</p><p></p><p>This was when his cultivation was only pre-heaven second-grade. If his cultivation broke through to the Divine Sect or even beyond, how powerful would he be? Could he instantly change the thinking of a master or even a group of masters?</p><p></p><p>It's simply killing people in an invisible way.</p><p></p><p>Spiritual cultivation techniques, YYDS!</p><p></p><p>"Why did you come to bother me today?"</p><p></p><p>The landlady rubbed her hands and chuckled.</p><p></p><p>"I set this rent of 100 yuan per month just to attract people to come and test it, you've been living here for many days without any problems, so I..."</p><p></p><p>Here is my translation of the Chinese excerpt you provided:</p><p></p><p>Ye Xiao gave a cold laugh. "So that's how it is - just as I suspected."</p><p></p><p>"What if I don't raise the rent?"</p><p></p><p>"At first I was going to kick you out if you didn't raise the rent. But then I saw how good-looking you are, just like those young idols on TV, and I thought maybe I could keep you as a mistress. And with no one around at this late hour, I could just have my way with you - your cultivation wouldn't be able to resist me.</p><p></p><p>Ah, how embarrassing!"</p><p></p><p>The landlady covered her face with her two delicate hands, shaking her head frantically.</p><p></p><p>Ye Xiao's face twitched involuntarily, and the illusory Liuli was rolling on the ground laughing.</p><p></p><p>"Hahaha!"</p><p></p><p>Ye Xiao spoke in a serious tone: "You know, when it comes to being a person, you should value integrity and conduct yourself properly."</p><p></p><p>"You're absolutely right."</p><p></p><p>"The rent is the amount you set yourself, and you have to abide by that."</p><p></p><p>"You're correct."</p><p></p><p>"Also, as a woman, you shouldn't be drooling over every man you see. Look at yourself, where's the dignity of a lady?"</p><p></p><p>"Well said!"</p><p></p><p>"Alright, consider this a lesson for you. Be a good person from now on!"</p><p></p><p>"Okay."</p><p></p><p>"Take that dirty water bucket out."</p><p></p><p>The landlady immediately picked up the dirty water bucket and left the room, while the illusory Liuli continued rolling on the ground laughing. Under Ye Xiao's mental control, the landlady poured the water directly on Liuli, turning her into a soaking wet cat.</p><p></p><p>Liuli: "..."</p><p></p><p>The night passed quickly, and Ye Xiao altered the landlady's memories, ensuring she would not recall this incident for the next year. By then, his cultivation would have likely reached a high enough level that he would no longer need to rent this place.</p>

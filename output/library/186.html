        <h1>Chapter 186</h1>
        <div class="content">
            <p>Here is the full English translation of the Chinese excerpt:</p><p></p><p>Time flew by, and half a month had passed.</p><p></p><p>In a few more days, it would be the one-month celebration for his adopted daughter, but Ye Xiao's final finger technique still had not made any progress.</p><p></p><p>However, since the last part of every cultivation method is usually the most difficult to find, Ye Xiao was not in a hurry. He just slowly and gradually progressed.</p><p></p><p>Ye Xiao planned to see if he could synthesize an Emperor Technique after the Innate Nine Grades. If he could synthesize an Emperor Technique, he would no longer continue studying these lower-level cultivation methods, but would try to find other Emperor Techniques instead.</p><p></p><p>Because only Emperor Techniques have the fastest improvement speed.</p><p></p><p>This brought up a question - would he need to leave the Martial Arts Library at that time?</p><p></p><p>At least the one in Jianghai City would not do.</p><p></p><p>The high-level cultivation methods here were too few, especially Emperor Techniques - not a single one.</p><p></p><p>How could he make do with this? But even in the top libraries of the major cities, Emperor Technique manuals also seemed scarce. The truly powerful Emperor Techniques were often hidden away within the top aristocratic families.</p><p></p><p>Ye Xiao couldn't possibly go around robbing them one by one.</p><p></p><p>There was only one path left to take - go to the Star Battlefield and slay Star Beasts, then obtain Emperor Techniques from the Dragon-level bloodline Star Beasts and complete further fusion!</p><p></p><p>Cultivation would never stop, and Ye Xiao had to become the strongest, to a degree where no one could rival him!</p><p></p><p>"You're reading books again!"</p><p></p><p>Just as Ye Xiao was reading, the voice of Liu Chengxun suddenly came.</p><p></p><p>Ye Xiao had already sensed his approach, so he was not surprised at all.</p><p></p><p>"Just passing time, reading some books."</p><p></p><p>Liu Chengxun glanced at the book Ye Xiao was reading - it was a finger technique at the Sub-Grandmaster level, not even a true Grandmaster technique. Such a cultivation method was naturally not worthy of his attention.</p><p></p><p>"I see you read a lot of books, and they're quite diverse. If you could remember and integrate them all, you could consider becoming a professor of theory."</p><p></p><p>In this world, one did not necessarily have to be a cultivator to become a professor. As long as one had rich martial arts knowledge, they could also be a professor.</p><p></p><p>Ye Xiao shook his head.</p><p></p><p>"I'll pass. I'm just casually flipping through them to kill time. I definitely can't manage to memorize and integrate them all."</p><p></p><p>Liu Chengxun smiled.</p><p></p><p>"How do you know you can't do it if you don't try?"</p><p></p><p>After a pause, he spoke again:</p><p></p><p>"By the way, since you've been in Jianghai City for so long, have you ever seen that Senior Sword-Immortal?"</p><p></p><p>Ye Xiao shook his head.</p><p></p><p>Liu Chengxun self-deprecatingly laughed.</p><p></p><p>"I'm so foolish. The Sword-Immortal Senior is elusive, even I haven't seen him. How could an ordinary person like you have seen him?"</p><p></p><p>Sensing that his tone had become a bit excessive, he immediately apologized.</p><p></p><p>"Sorry, I went a bit too far with my words."</p><p></p><p>"It's fine. After all, you are a powerful Saint-Emperor, and I am indeed just an ordinary person."</p><p></p><p>Seeing that Ye Xiao didn't mind, Liu Chengxun couldn't help but sigh:</p><p></p><p>"You don't know, in my life I've admired very few people. </p><p></p><p>Half a month ago, the Sword-Immortal appeared in the mountains once. I watched him from afar, and he was like an invincible war god, standing high in the sky and slicing open the clouds with a single sword strike.</p><p></p><p>I dare say that even I, at the Innate Eighth Grade Saint-Emperor realm, would be reduced to ashes under that sword strike.</p><p></p><p>He is too strong, too dazzling, like a sun that makes one involuntarily revere him and long to see him.</p><p></p><p>I admire him so much."</p><p></p><p>Watching Liu Chengxun's fanatical gaze, Ye Xiao couldn't help but raise his eyebrows.</p><p></p><p>Normally, being so revered by a Saint-Emperor should make Ye Xiao happy, but he instead felt a bit of nausea in his stomach.</p><p></p><p>Perhaps it was because Liu Chengxun was a grown man, and an over-forty-year-old one at that.</p><p></p><p>If Liu Chengxun didn't express himself so passionately in front of Ye Xiao, he might have been able to accept it.</p><p></p><p>But with Liu Chengxun acting like a fanboy in front of him, Ye Xiao found it a bit hard to bear.</p><p></p><p>Nevertheless, he still politely responded.</p><p></p><p>"Then I wish you the best in meeting your idol."</p><p></p><p>Liu Chengxun was in high spirits, his gaze resolute. "I will definitely find him. I've decided to stay here for a year, and within that year, I will absolutely find Senior Sword-Immortal."</p><p></p><p>Ye Xiao fell silent for a moment.</p><p></p><p>"Isn't that a bit too confident? The entire Nine States have been searching for him for a whole year, are you sure you can find him?"</p><p></p><p>Liu Chengxun was taken aback.</p><p></p><p>"The Nine States have been searching for a whole year?"</p><p></p><p>Ye Xiao nodded.</p><p></p><p>"Ever since they learned of the Sword-Immortal's existence, they've been searching, but there's still not a single clue."</p><p></p><p>As he said this, Ye Xiao noticed Liu Chengxun's expression becoming increasingly serious.</p><p></p><p>This made the corner of Ye Xiao's mouth twitch slightly - good, this way, this guy might not be so overly confident anymore.</p><p></p><p>Here is my translation of the Chinese excerpt:</p><p></p><p>It seems he should know the difficulty and choose to leave the Jianghai City, right?</p><p></p><p>However, in the next second, Liu Chengxun spoke up seriously:</p><p></p><p>"Okay, it seems that Senior Immortal Sword and Saber is indeed not that easy to find! Since that's the case, I've decided that I will stay here for two years. Within these two years, I will definitely be able to find Senior Immortal Sword and Saber."</p><p></p><p>Ye Xiao: "(￣.￣)!"</p><p></p><p>I shouldn't have said more.</p><p></p><p>Originally, the other party might have left in just a year due to disappointment, but now it's become two years. </p><p></p><p>Thinking about having to occasionally listen to a man in his forties express admiration for me over the next two years makes Ye Xiao feel very uncomfortable! He can only wish that he can break through to the Ninth Grade of the Innate Realm and activate the Imperial Technique Synthesis as soon as possible.</p><p></p><p>Once he can activate the Imperial Technique Synthesis, he won't have to stay in this library all the time.</p><p></p><p>"Your finger technique is only at the Sub-Grandmaster level, so its power is not that strong. But I cultivate the Sword Dao, so I don't have any finger techniques to show you either.</p><p></p><p>However, I seem to have a few finger technique books over there. If you're interested, you can go take a look."</p><p></p><p>"Oh really? Then I'll go take a look now."</p><p></p><p>In Ye Xiao's own books, it's hard to find the last basic finger technique. He's almost finished reading all the books related to finger techniques, so since Liu Chengxun has some, he can also go take a look.</p><p></p><p>He went to Liu Chengxun's area, and to his surprise, Liu Chengxun's area was very clean.</p><p></p><p>It seems this Liu Chengxun is really determined to find him.</p><p></p><p>Even being a librarian, he's doing it so seriously.</p><p></p><p>What surprised him even more was that Pu Jiansheng was also here, with a pile of books in front of him.</p><p></p><p>"You're here too."</p><p></p><p>Ye Xiao greeted him, and Pu Jiansheng raised his head, waved his hand, and then lowered his head again to look at the books.</p><p></p><p>Liu Chengxun explained:</p><p></p><p>"He has now applied for and successfully transferred his nationality back to the Nine States. From now on, he will be a citizen of the Nine States. He has joined the Jianghai City Martial Arts Academy and is preparing to take the teacher qualification exam."</p><p></p><p>"So he also wants to become a teacher!"</p><p></p><p>"It was my suggestion for him to become a teacher. In fact, being a teacher is a very good way to improve oneself. In the process of teaching, one will also realize one's own shortcomings and constantly improve and perfect oneself.</p><p></p><p>Moreover, Jiansheng now needs to adjust his mentality. He recently saw that Qin Yuyan, one of you from the Nine States, had awakened the Imperial bloodline and her cultivation progressed very quickly, causing him to become somewhat unbalanced in his martial dao heart.</p><p></p><p>So I told him to take the teacher qualification exam and become a teacher, hoping that it will help him calm down."</p><p></p><p>"I see."</p><p></p><p>Ye Xiao nodded, not expecting that Qin Yuyan had actually broken through.</p><p></p><p>But thinking about it, after reaching the Grandmaster realm, once she awakened the Imperial bloodline, her cultivation speed would be extremely fast. </p><p></p><p>And with the Nine States putting a lot of resources into quickly cultivating her, even if she didn't want to break through, she would still advance rapidly.</p><p></p><p>It's just that in front of Liu Chengxun, he doesn't want to use the Taixuan Tiangong too much. He wants to see what level that Qin Yuyan has reached, so he can judge how heaven-defying the awakening of the Imperial bloodline is.</p><p></p><p>Oh well, he should just go find his own books first.</p><p></p><p>Ye Xiao quickly found a few techniques.</p><p></p><p>But unfortunately, the few Shaolin finger techniques were all ones that Ye Xiao had already learned - the Picking Flower Finger, the Great Strength Golden Ape Finger, and the One Yang Finger.</p><p></p><p>Just as Ye Xiao thought he would be wasting his time again, he suddenly found a finger technique in the corner.</p><p></p><p>"The Formless Calamity Finger!"</p><p></p><p>Ye Xiao's eyes lit up. The Formless Calamity Finger was a technique he had never cultivated before. He didn't know if it could fill the gap in his finger techniques.</p><p></p><p>He quickly took out the technique manual, and the Golden Book Spirit trembled slightly.</p><p></p><p>Ye Xiao's face lit up - success!</p><p></p><p>This was truly the last finger technique.</p><p></p><p>Because every time it was time to synthesize, when he found the last technique, the Golden Book Spirit would react.</p><p></p><p>Ye Xiao suddenly thought of something - he should actually read more books, trying to upgrade the remaining leg techniques and claw techniques he wants to cultivate to the final level. That way, he won't have to search book by book, he can just feel along the bookshelf, and when the Golden Book Spirit reacts, he'll know he's found the last one.</p><p></p><p>This plan is quite perfect.</p><p></p><p>But for now, Ye Xiao needs to first read this last finger technique, as the work bell is about to ring.</p><p></p><p>Duang~!</p><p></p><p>Two minutes later, the work bell rang, and Ye Xiao had already imprinted the Formless Calamity Finger onto his Golden Book. The Golden Book has already begun cultivating it, and by the time it returns home, it will probably have reached the Great Perfection realm and be ready for synthesis.</p><p></p><p>At the same time, three imposing figures silently descended upon Jianghai City.</p><p></p><p>They had physiques different from normal humans - some were as burly as oxen, others slender and graceful.</p><p></p><p>"So this is Jianghai City?"</p><p></p><p>Five updates, 15,000 words.</p><p></p><p>Please recommend, vote, and subscribe.</p><p></p><p>My nose hit the desk and bled a lot, and I'm a bit dizzy. If I can't finish 20,000 words, I hope I won't be blamed, sorry.</p><p></p><p>(Chapter end)</p>

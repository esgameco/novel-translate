        <h1>Chapter 50</h1>
        <div class="content">
            <p>Here is the full English translation of the Chinese excerpt:</p><p></p><p>"Damn it! Just a little more! Just a little more! This king would have been able to get out! How could this happen?"</p><p></p><p>Not long after, the other party's voice became more low-pitched.</p><p></p><p>"This time, you humans are lucky, but don't be too proud of it. The seven stars will soon converge, and then the power of the star beasts will reach its peak.</p><p></p><p>This king will eventually escape this damned abyss.</p><p></p><p>It won't be long now..."</p><p></p><p>The life in Jianghai City has returned to a peaceful period.</p><p></p><p>But the hearts of the common people are not so easily calmed.</p><p></p><p>Whenever a major event occurs, the two legends of Jianghai City are always the most discussed.</p><p></p><p>One sword, one blade.</p><p> </p><p>The strong are like dragons, mysterious and unseen.</p><p></p><p>On Tuesday morning, Ye Xiao carried his breakfast and walked to the library for work.</p><p></p><p>Passing by Wang Da Square, the giant electronic screen at the mall entrance was playing a news program from Jianghai TV.</p><p></p><p>Ye Xiao sipped his soy milk and listened to the news.</p><p></p><p>"Hello everyone, this is Jianghai City TV, the morning talk show.</p><p></p><p>Recently, Jianghai City has seen many strange phenomena, causing netizens to speculate whether it is the work of our city's mysterious experts.</p><p></p><p>In this program, we have invited Professor Zhang Daqiang, an adjunct professor at Jianghai City Martial Arts University, a Posterior Celestial Realm Eighth-Grade Cultivator.</p><p></p><p>Ms. Pan Yinlian, the chairwoman of the Panshi Group, a Posterior Celestial Realm Ninth-Grade Cultivator.</p><p></p><p>And Mr. Zhang Liang, the founder of Zhang Liang Spicy Soup, a retired soldier, a Posterior Celestial Realm Seventh-Grade Cultivator.</p><p></p><p>Now let's invite these martial arts experts to share their professional perspectives on the mysterious events in Jianghai City, as well as the impact behind these mysteries."</p><p></p><p>The first to speak was the retired soldier Zhang Liang. His face was extremely solemn as he knocked on the table and said seriously:</p><p></p><p>"Based on my many years of experience in the jianghu, I believe Jianghai City must have a great treasure!"</p><p></p><p>This statement immediately caught the attention of many passersby.</p><p></p><p>Zhang Liang continued:</p><p></p><p>"Throughout history, small places can only attract powerful experts for one reason - they are hiding their identities and retiring from the world!</p><p></p><p>If there is only one expert in our Jianghai City, it must be because he is tired of the treacherous life and wants to settle down.</p><p></p><p>But now, Jianghai City has two such experts.</p><p></p><p>You know, one mountain cannot have two tigers, unless it's a male and a female!</p><p></p><p>The appearance of two super experts can only mean one thing - there must be something that is attracting them.</p><p></p><p>Therefore, I conclude that Jianghai City will see more and more powerful experts in the future!"</p><p></p><p>Professor Zhang Daqiang nodded in agreement.</p><p></p><p>"I agree with what Old Man Zhang said. I've researched many ancient texts and found that Jianghai City has many legends hinting at its extraordinary nature.</p><p></p><p>It's not that the experts chose Jianghai City, but rather Jianghai City has attracted the experts.</p><p></p><p>And with the arrival of these experts, Jianghai City will also attract a large number of ordinary martial artists.</p><p></p><p>The surge in population will inevitably lead to a rise in housing prices. If you have some money and don't know where to invest, I suggest you buy houses, especially in the Bixiu District, as the prices will definitely rise!"</p><p></p><p>Lastly, Pan Yinlian spoke.</p><p></p><p>"We all hope that Jianghai City will develop better and better. This is very likely to be an opportunity for our city.</p><p></p><p>As we all know, if a city has a great treasure, it will have a huge impact on the city's safety."</p><p></p><p>Here is the full English translation of the Chinese excerpt:</p><p></p><p>It will inevitably generate a very strong suction effect. </p><p></p><p>In the next few decades, it can be foreseen that the changes in Jianghai City will be earth-shattering.</p><p></p><p>At the same time, I feel that the entrepreneurs of our Jianghai City should provide a better quality of life for these grand masters, to thank them for their indelible and important contributions to the development of our Jianghai City."</p><p></p><p>Ye Xiao didn't finish listening, casually threw away the breakfast trash in his hand, and walked away directly.</p><p></p><p>How shameless!</p><p></p><p>These so-called "brick experts" are good for nothing but fabricating.</p><p></p><p>And even more shameless is that they are taking the opportunity to drive up housing prices, even using his name to drive them up.</p><p></p><p>Although I can't afford a house anyway, I'm really annoyed by these unscrupulous businessmen.</p><p></p><p>This damned capitalism!</p><p></p><p>I've decided, I'll never talk about love, get married, have children, or buy a house! </p><p></p><p>After barely getting a new lease on life, I absolutely won't become a house slave! But speaking of which, as I get stronger and stronger, it seems that my influence on Jianghai City is getting greater and greater. Could it be that I am the flapping butterfly? Will I bring the butterfly effect to this world? I hope I don't bring disaster to this world.</p><p></p><p>If it is truly inevitable that I will bring disaster, I hope it will only be to places like Meizhoug, Yingzhou, and California, as long as it doesn't affect the Nine States, it won't be too much of a problem.</p><p></p><p>After arriving at the library, the library had been renovated.</p><p></p><p>The brand new library, the architecture is somewhat different from before, this time the overall building is much larger than before, expanded by at least more than double.</p><p></p><p>For this martial arts world, the level of technological development is also quite good.</p><p></p><p>Take architecture for example, various high-strength new composite materials, building houses is both fast and cheap.</p><p></p><p>Of course, just because the materials are cheap doesn't mean housing prices are low, housing prices are still very high, and with that group of "brick experts" trying to take the opportunity to drive up housing prices, it's estimated that Jianghai City will rise even more in the future.</p><p></p><p>But what piqued Ye Xiao's curiosity was that there were many large trucks parked at the entrance, he didn't know what they were for.</p><p></p><p>He swept them with the Taixuan Tiangong, and they were all filled with books.</p><p></p><p>This made his eyes light up.</p><p></p><p>These books... many of them are new, could it be that the library just bought these new books?</p><p></p><p>Unexpectedly, there was a pleasant surprise, which immediately improved his sour mood this morning.</p><p></p><p>With so many new books, he estimated that he would be able to find a lot of basic cultivation methods.</p><p></p><p>"Manager Ye, you're here."</p><p></p><p>When he walked into the library, Ning Yuhen saw Ye Xiao arrive and immediately came forward to greet him, Ye Xiao nodded.</p><p></p><p>After they clocked in, they came to the hall and sat down, the library was reopening, so they must be having a meeting.</p><p></p><p>Soon, Ouyang Yunzhong came to the hall with a solemn expression.</p><p></p><p>"Before we start today's meeting, let's have a moment of silence for the colleagues who died in this incident. Stand up!"</p><p></p><p>Everyone stood up in a flurry and bowed their heads to mourn the deceased colleagues.</p><p></p><p>Ye Xiao swept them with the Taixuan Tiangong, and the vast majority of colleagues were still there, only a few were missing.</p><p></p><p>It seems that Yang Zhengyi didn't go too far.</p><p></p><p>But thinking about it, it makes sense, Yang Zhengyi himself is a grand master, if he wanted to steal something, very few people would be able to discover him, so there wouldn't be any conflict.</p><p></p><p>After a minute of silence, Ouyang Yunzhong waved his hand, indicating for everyone to sit down.</p><p></p><p>"Now let's start today's meeting, there are two things..."</p>

        <h1>Chapter 386</h1>
        <div class="content">
            <p>Here is the full English translation of the excerpt from the Chinese novel:</p><p></p><p>If they could find him and cultivate him, the status of the Yun family could be consolidated once again.</p><p></p><p>This Yun family really knows how to make good calculations.</p><p></p><p>After all, that genius, that prodigy, even if they found him, they could still cultivate him.</p><p></p><p>They don't need to interfere at all.</p><p></p><p>"Hehe, the Yun family heard that in this human world, there has appeared an extraordinary genius who may change the fate of our Xuanyuan Clan, so we immediately rushed over without delay.</p><p></p><p>Whatever is good for our Xuanyuan Clan, the Yun family will do it without any hesitation."</p><p></p><p>Although the others were quite unhappy about the Yun family interfering in this matter, but after all, they were all from the same clan.</p><p></p><p>So, they could only welcome them with a smile.</p><p></p><p>"It's rare for the Yun family to have this kind of heart."</p><p></p><p>"I wonder if you all have discussed and reached a conclusion? Have you thought of any way to find that extraordinary genius?"</p><p></p><p>The others shook their heads.</p><p></p><p>"We have searched repeatedly, but no matter what, we still can't find the other party's whereabouts."</p><p></p><p>Cloud Water pondered for a moment.</p><p></p><p>"It seems this child is quite mischievous. Then we'll have to put in more effort. Everyone, our Yun family will first find a place to station, and as for other matters, we'll discuss them later. Farewell."</p><p></p><p>After he left, Ling Shaoyu spat.</p><p></p><p>"The Yun family really knows how to do good things. They have already cultivated so many generations of saints, and now that we have finally encountered an opportunity, they want to interfere again. They really don't give people a chance to live."</p><p></p><p>Song Qingxue shook her head and smiled wryly.</p><p></p><p>"What can we do? After all, the Yun family is also a part of the Xuanyuan Clan. We can't just drive them away, right? They are also working hard for our Xuanyuan Clan."</p><p></p><p>Another figure spoke:</p><p></p><p>"That's well said. As long as it's for our Xuanyuan Clan, everyone should unite and not be exclusive.</p><p></p><p>Whoever can find that genius must be responsible for cultivating him to the fullest."</p><p></p><p>"Alright, let's leave it at that for now. Everyone go back to their own stations and try to find him as soon as possible. Also, we can't slack off on the Divine Tomb in the Starry Sky, we can't let other clans take advantage of it."</p><p></p><p>"Yes!"</p><p></p><p>The spiritual energy ship of the Yun family descended to the ground of the Nine States. A Yun family disciple, holding a cage, came before Cloud Water.</p><p></p><p>"Elder Cloud, I've brought what you wanted."</p><p></p><p>Elder Cloud nodded.</p><p></p><p>"Put it down."</p><p></p><p>The Yun family disciple placed the cage on the ground and lifted the canvas cover, revealing a Xuanming Wolf with extremely thick blood qi.</p><p></p><p>"Roar!"</p><p></p><p>It let out an angry low growl, but after seeing Cloud Water's gaze, it immediately lost its spirit and curled up.</p><p></p><p>The Yun family disciple couldn't help but marvel inwardly. Even a beast lord comparable to the eighth level of the Divine Realm, seeing Elder Cloud's gaze, was so terrified, just how terrifying must Elder Cloud's strength be?</p><p></p><p>Cloud Water looked at the trembling Xuanming Wolf, squinting his eyes and smiling lightly.</p><p></p><p>"The Xuanming Wolf is an excellent star beast for tracking prey. They have an innate sense of bloodline, and can clearly locate those with powerful bloodline power.</p><p></p><p>In this world, there are so few humans, with it, we should be able to easily find that boy."</p><p></p><p>The Yun family disciple smiled:</p><p></p><p>"Elder Cloud really has a plan. As long as we can find him and bring him back to the Yun family to cultivate, in the future, we can cultivate another saint-level existence!"</p><p></p><p>"Saint-level? Haha, you're thinking too much. The Yun family already has one saint-level disciple, we don't need another one!"</p><p></p><p>The Yun family disciple's heart couldn't help but tremble as he said, "Does Elder Cloud's meaning mean...?"</p><p></p><p>"After finding that boy, directly kill him and devour his bloodline, bring it back to us."</p><p></p><p>"How can this be? He is a genius of our Xuanyuan Clan, if we can cultivate him, it will allow our Xuanyuan Clan's strength to rise to a new level! Why kill him?"</p><p></p><p>Cloud Water glanced at him and snorted lightly.</p><p></p><p>"You really have a pig's brain. Do you think that level of existence will bring glory to our Xuanyuan Clan? You're thinking too much.</p><p></p><p>Remember that guy from more than two thousand years ago?"</p><p></p><p>The Yun family disciple thought of a name, and his expression immediately became solemn.</p><p></p><p>The guy from more than two thousand years ago, of course, it must be that person.</p><p></p><p>He represented an era, an extremely brilliant and dazzling era!</p><p></p><p>It was he who, in an instant, pulled the Xuanyuan Clan, which was about to fall out of the top thirty in the Starry Sky, back to the nineteenth place! It was he who supported a clan that was about to wither, and restored its former glory.</p><p></p><p>Seeing that he didn't speak, Cloud Water knew that he had already understood who he was talking about.</p><p></p><p>"That person back then, shook the heavens and the earth, brilliant and unparalleled.</p><p></p><p>To cultivate him, the entire Xuanyuan Clan almost exhausted all its excellent resources, concentrating them all on him.</p><p></p><p>This created an era that belonged to him! But in the end, how did he do it? Cultivating to the Divine Emperor realm...</p><p></p><p>Here is my translation of the Chinese excerpt you provided:</p><p></p><p>After that, he used the excuse of traveling through the starry skies and cultivating the martial dao, and from then on never returned, never appearing again. If it were not for his sudden departure, the Xuanyuan clan's current ranking might have risen even higher.</p><p></p><p>These peerless geniuses, although their talent is monstrous, are ultimately wolf cubs that can never be fully tamed.</p><p></p><p>When you need them, they act obediently, but when they no longer need you, they'll kick you aside without a second thought.</p><p></p><p>That disciple of the Yun clan spoke up again:</p><p></p><p>"Even so, he still helped our Xuanyuan Divine Clan, raising our ranking and reactivating the divine emperor bloodline, allowing our Xuanyuan Divine Clan to cultivate several talents over the past two thousand-plus years.</p><p></p><p>If we could find this genius and nurture him properly, even if he may leave in the future, at least for now he can help us raise the Xuanyuan Divine Clan's ranking. We wouldn't be losing out."</p><p></p><p>"You're thinking too ideally. Do you think raising our ranking is that easy? </p><p></p><p>If our ranking rises, it means someone else's ranking will drop. Do you think they'll agree to that? Not to mention, raising our ranking means bloodshed and sacrifice.</p><p></p><p>Even if this kid is monstrous and can raise the Xuanyuan Divine Clan's ranking by a few spots, so what? He can never possibly raise the Xuanyuan Divine Clan to first place, or even the top ten.</p><p></p><p>Rankings in the teens, like 19th or 11th, are meaningless, aside from sounding good when said out loud.</p><p></p><p>But in reality, this would bring even greater hidden dangers to our clan.</p><p></p><p>If he also learns to leave like Ancestor Long, there will be no one to protect the Xuanyuan Divine Clan.</p><p></p><p>The Xuanyuan Divine Clan will be in big trouble then.</p><p></p><p>As the saying goes, 'A tree that stands out in the forest will surely be blown down by the wind.'</p><p></p><p>Rather than letting this uncontrollable factor push the Xuanyuan Divine Clan towards an even more dangerous situation, it would be better to just eliminate him and absorb his divine blood into our own bodies.</p><p></p><p>This way, we can avoid the trouble he might bring to the Xuanyuan Divine Clan, and not waste his divine blood either. Don't worry, I'll give you a share of his divine blood when the time comes."</p><p></p><p>"But Elder Cloud, don't forget that it's not just us from the Yun clan here. If the other clans find out about this, it would be a huge hidden danger for the reputation of the Yun clan."</p><p></p><p>Cloud Water smiled slightly. </p><p></p><p>"You were able to think of that aspect, do you think I haven't considered it? Don't worry, I will erase this Abyss Wolf's memories and simply give him a single order.</p><p></p><p>Unless he encounters an existence with an exceptionally high bloodline, he absolutely will not launch an attack.</p><p></p><p>This way, no one will discover our actions.</p><p></p><p>Don't underestimate the wisdom of a Beast Sovereign at the Divine Realm Eighth Layer."</p><p></p><p>The Yun clan disciple's eyes flickered, and although he was somewhat unwilling, he didn't dare to directly defy Cloud Water, for he knew the consequences would be deadly.</p><p></p><p>On the other side, Ye Xiao finished his day's work and returned home to eat fish.</p><p></p><p>He was quite helpless. </p><p></p><p>Although the taste of this fish was very delicious, eating it every day was still tiring. No matter how good something is, eating it too much will make you sick of it.</p><p></p><p>Furthermore, after absorbing the divine blood of that Divine King, enhancing his cultivation and blood qi, the blood qi this fish could provide was no longer as abundant.</p><p></p><p>Ye Xiao was very troubled.</p><p></p><p>He knew that at this rate, before he could break through to the Slay God Realm, the blood qi from the big fish would not be enough. And when he reached the Slay God Realm, the blood qi would be even more insufficient.</p><p></p><p>That would definitely slow down the speed of his cultivation advancement.</p><p></p><p>The excavation of the Divine Nation's Treasure Vault had reached over 30%, with two-thirds of the project still remaining. It was impossible to obtain the treasures inside in the short term.</p><p></p><p>He could only rely on the medicinal pills obtained from that Divine King's tomb to support himself for now.</p><p></p><p>But the medicinal pills were limited. Consuming one meant one less, and they wouldn't last very long.</p><p></p><p>Unfortunately, Beast Sovereigns were extremely hard to find, and there were none in this star domain. To search for them, he would have to go to higher-level places, which were also dangerous, making it not worthwhile.</p><p></p><p>Returning to the Xuanyuan Divine Clan and acknowledging his ancestry was absolutely impossible. Not until his strength was sufficient would he ever publicly reveal his identity. Safety came first.</p><p></p><p>It seemed there was only one path left.</p><p></p><p>He would have to go out and excavate a few more Divine King tombs. There were the most Divine King tombs in the starry skies, and digging a few should be enough to sustain him for a while, until his cultivation reached the late Slay God Realm, at which point the problem should not be too great.</p><p></p><p>By then, his cultivation would have improved, and the Divine Nation's Treasure Vault should also be accessible. He could then utilize the resources of the Divine Nation's Treasure Vault to advance to beyond the Divine King Realm, even to the Divine Emperor Realm!</p><p></p><p>Once he reached the Divine Emperor Realm, the many subsequent problems would be easily resolved.</p><p></p><p>This is a two-chapter update, totaling 6,000 words.</p><p></p><p>Please recommend votes and monthly votes.</p><p></p><p>Thank you to book friend Qing Huang Yuzi for the reward, I am deeply grateful.</p><p></p><p>(This chapter is complete)</p>

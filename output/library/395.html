        <h1>Chapter 395</h1>
        <div class="content">
            <p>Here is the full English translation of the Chinese excerpt:</p><p></p><p>The moment these words were spoken, the entire venue fell into a deathly silence.</p><p></p><p>After a long while, Songqingxue finally asked with a hint of uncertainty:</p><p></p><p>"You two just saw the legendary genius?"</p><p></p><p>Ning Zhiyuan nodded, confirming it again, and the crowd immediately erupted.</p><p></p><p>"What does he look like?"</p><p>"Who is he? Is he really a very young person?!"</p><p>"Uh, well..."</p><p></p><p>Ning Zhiyuan's expression couldn't help but become a little embarrassed.</p><p></p><p>"Actually, we didn't get a good look at his face. After he saved us, he stepped into the Shen King's Tomb."</p><p></p><p>The crowd couldn't help but feel speechless.</p><p></p><p>"So you just saw a lonely person, and in the end, you didn't see anything."</p><p></p><p>Ning Zhiyuan was quite helpless as he recounted the entire story, front to back, and the crowd finally understood.</p><p></p><p>It should still be that Sword Immortal, who didn't want to reveal his identity, so he didn't actively show his face.</p><p></p><p>"Ning Zhiyuan, how strong is that Sword Immortal?"</p><p></p><p>At this time, the young master of the Zheng family, Zheng Fenghua, couldn't help but ask.</p><p></p><p>His strength was enough to rank in the top three of the XuanYuan Prodigies List, and he was now a being above the Shen Realm Sixth Layer. Compared to Ning Zhiyuan, who was ranked seventeenth, he was far, far stronger.</p><p></p><p>So his focus was on Ye Xiao's cultivation.</p><p></p><p>Ning Zhiyuan nodded, his expression extremely serious.</p><p></p><p>"Very strong, strong to the point of being unbelievable."</p><p></p><p>Ling Shaoyu also chimed in:</p><p></p><p>"He not only is proficient in healing arts, but also in poison techniques. He is immune to all poisons, and that kind of poisonous mist that even Shen Realm experts cannot resist is like nothing to him.</p><p></p><p>He can also unlock formations. The formations that took us half a day to unlock, he could instantly solve."</p><p></p><p>Ning Zhiyuan spoke again: "This is just the tip of the iceberg of what he revealed to us. His movement speed is also unmatched by anyone. I feel that within the same level, there are probably not many in the entire starry sky who can keep up with him.</p><p></p><p>That healing art, I vaguely feel, has already surpassed the realm of the Nine Star Divine Arts. It is very likely an Ancient Treasure Art."</p><p></p><p>"Sssss! An Ancient Treasure Art!"</p><p></p><p>Hearing these words, the crowd couldn't help but shudder.</p><p></p><p>Just where did this guy learn all these amazing skills? It's simply too exaggerated! Now he even has an Ancient Treasure Art!</p><p></p><p>After all, even the XuanYuan Clan only has two or three Ancient Treasure Arts as their clan's treasures.</p><p></p><p>And the Sword Immortal hasn't even returned to the XuanYuan Clan yet!</p><p></p><p>According to common sense, he shouldn't have an Ancient Treasure Art at this moment! At this time and place, all the people here couldn't help but have a thought in their hearts.</p><p></p><p>No matter what, they must find the Sword Immortal.</p><p></p><p>Ning Zhiyuan spoke:</p><p></p><p>"Let's go back. If nothing unexpected happens, this Shen King's Tomb should be empty, just like the previous one.</p><p></p><p>We don't need to wait here any longer."</p><p></p><p>The crowd nodded.</p><p></p><p>Ning Zhiyuan was right. Leaving aside that guy, with his poison resistance and ability to easily break formations, this Shen King's Tomb, if it could withstand him, would be the problem.</p><p></p><p>On the other side, the Alliance of a Hundred Tribes, who had been anxiously waiting outside the Shen King's Tomb for several hours, found that the poisonous mist in the void had gradually dissipated.</p><p></p><p>Zhu Chunqiu spoke:</p><p></p><p>"The poison has dissipated a lot now, we can't wait any longer. Let's go in directly.</p><p></p><p>Only by taking the lead can we obtain the treasures and resources in this Shen King's Tomb.</p><p></p><p>Otherwise, when the poison mist completely disperses, and the XuanYuan Clan also comes to compete, we will lose at least half of the resources."</p><p></p><p>The crowd nodded.</p><p></p><p>"But now, there are still traces of poison in the air, we still need to be on guard."</p><p></p><p>"Using special anti-poison treasures, although it will consume a lot of resources, the resources in the Shen King's Tomb are who knows how many times more? It's definitely a profitable deal!"</p><p></p><p>"Good! Let's go in."</p><p></p><p>The Alliance of a Hundred Tribes was extremely excited, their eyes shining.</p><p></p><p>After all, this was a real Shen King's Tomb! It was different from the previous one.</p><p></p><p>The previous Shen King's Tomb might have already been tampered with, so it was empty inside.</p><p></p><p>But this Shen King's Tomb was filled with so much poisonous mist, it was clear that no one had touched it.</p><p></p><p>Just thinking about the resources inside, they couldn't help but salivate.</p><p></p><p>Soon, the Alliance of a Hundred Tribes organized a team of extremely powerful beings, equipped with anti-poison treasures, and rushed into the Shen King's Tomb like hungry wolves.</p><p></p><p>However, as soon as they ran in, they were immediately dumbfounded, as if a bucket of cold water had been poured over their heads.</p><p></p><p>What was this situation? Why was it empty here? There was nothing?</p><p></p><p>Where were the resources? The burial items left by the Shen King's experts?</p><p></p><p>"Go search the interior thoroughly, see if those treasures are hidden in some corner."</p><p></p><p>"Yes!"</p><p>The crowd shouted in unison.</p><p></p><p>Here is my translation of the Chinese excerpt you provided:</p><p></p><p>With a shout, he then transformed into a mouse shadow and scattered in all directions.</p><p></p><p>However, moments later, the group came running back in utter despair.</p><p></p><p>"Nothing on the east side."</p><p>"Nothing on the west side either!"</p><p>"Nothing on the south side."</p><p>"Nothing on the north side either!"</p><p></p><p>Zhu Chunqiu trembled with anger.</p><p></p><p>"It must be the Xuanyuan Clan! Damn the Xuanyuan Clan! It's 100% them who have taken all the resources here! Aaargh, Xuanyuan Clan, my entire tribe is at odds with you!"</p><p></p><p>On the other side, after returning home, Ye Xiao immediately took out several manuals on martial arts experience that he had obtained from the Shenwang Tomb.</p><p></p><p>These martial arts experience manuals did not actually belong to that Poison King, but were taken by Ye Xiao after slaying other enemies and seizing them from their hands.</p><p></p><p>But whose they were did not matter, as long as Ye Xiao could use them.</p><p></p><p>"Shen Boundary, transcending the mortal body, merging with spiritual energy, achieving what ordinary people cannot. Sheshen Boundary, viewing gods as weeds, slaying all enemies in the world."</p><p></p><p>After briefly skimming through them, Ye Xiao gained some understanding and obtained a lot of insights.</p><p></p><p>Overnight, he felt his divine soul had progressed significantly, and his cultivation speed had increased greatly.</p><p></p><p>At dawn, when Ye Xiao opened his eyes, an extremely sharp light flashed in his gaze.</p><p></p><p>"My mental state has improved. As long as I can raise my blood qi strength to the Sheshen Boundary, I will be able to perfectly integrate my divine soul and divine body, completely becoming a Sheshen Boundary expert!"</p><p></p><p>Ye Xiao clenched his fists as he returned to the starry sky.</p><p></p><p>Above the divine boundary, if it was just a minor realm breakthrough, there would be no issues.</p><p></p><p>But if it was a major realm breakthrough, there would definitely be celestial anomalies, and even the descent of divine tribulation lightning.</p><p></p><p>The disturbance would be too great. Doing it in the human world would surely be discovered by others.</p><p></p><p>Because the human world is too small.</p><p></p><p>Only the boundless starry sky could provide the perfect place to shield himself during the tribulation.</p><p></p><p>Originally, to break through to the Sheshen Boundary, Ye Xiao would need to refine a dan. He had to rely on the impact of the dan to obtain sufficient spiritual energy to thoroughly refine the divine blood within him.</p><p></p><p>But just now, Ye Xiao had obtained more than two million drops of divine blood from that Poison King's body.</p><p></p><p>Ye Xiao planned to use those two million-plus drops of divine blood as his backup power source for the breakthrough.</p><p></p><p>After the successful breakthrough, he would then use those poisonous materials to refine an extremely powerful dan, to see if he could achieve another layer of advancement, just like last time.</p><p></p><p>Just like last time, Ye Xiao came to that meteor swarm again.</p><p></p><p>After setting up the formation, he took a deep breath, and in the next moment, he unleashed his full aura.</p><p></p><p>Boom! Accompanied by a thunderous roar, in the next instant, countless purple electric divine thunderbolts converged in the sky above the meteor swarm.</p><p></p><p>The pressure of this tribulation was more than ten times stronger than the previous one.</p><p></p><p>But Ye Xiao had no intention of retreating, because this time, he was also more than ten times stronger!</p><p></p><p>"Come on!"</p><p></p><p>The first divine thunderbolt heavily struck Ye Xiao's body.</p><p></p><p>Ye Xiao did not dodge or use any defensive abilities to block it.</p><p></p><p>The early stage tribulation lightning was not that powerful, it was just a test version.</p><p></p><p>He wanted to use this tribulation to help him refine the divine blood within him, which would be much faster than his own cultivation.</p><p></p><p>Otherwise, refining those two million-plus drops of divine blood would take him at least a week.</p><p></p><p>That speed was too slow, and by the time he was ready, the opportunity would have passed, and he might even lose his life to this tribulation.</p><p></p><p>The electric current entered his body, powerfully tempering his physique. His viscera, limbs, and mind all felt the stinging pain of the electric shocks.</p><p></p><p>It was as painful as being pierced by needles.</p><p></p><p>But Ye Xiao did not utter a single cry of pain.</p><p></p><p>Enduring the bitterness within bitterness is the way to become superior! If he couldn't even withstand this little pain, how could he talk about improving his own strength? That would be mere empty talk.</p><p></p><p>Soon, the second, third, fourth, and successive thunderbolts fell frantically upon him, and Ye Xiao absorbed all this power into his body, integrating it into his meridians, forcibly refining the two million-plus drops of divine blood within him.</p><p></p><p>Under the forceful tempering of the thunderbolts, the divine blood, despite its lofty pride, gradually shattered its consciousness, drop by drop of the crimson lifeblood merging into Ye Xiao's body, becoming his divine blood.</p><p></p><p>Obtaining this divine blood power, Ye Xiao's cultivation and aura were also rapidly ascending.</p><p></p><p>Roar! At this moment, Ye Xiao inexplicably felt like he heard a dragon's roar.</p><p></p><p>It was a power from the depths of his bloodline, shaking his divine soul.</p><p></p><p>The thunderbolts shattered Ye Xiao's flesh, and all of his cultivation techniques began to operate automatically.</p><p></p><p>Especially the Immortal Treasure Art, which continuously repaired Ye Xiao's body.</p><p></p><p>The more he was injured, the stronger Ye Xiao became.</p><p></p><p>Finally, when Ye Xiao's power reached an extreme limit, his divine body underwent another earth-shattering transformation!</p>

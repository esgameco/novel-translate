        <h1>Chapter 77</h1>
        <div class="content">
            <p>Here is the full English translation of the Chinese excerpt:</p><p></p><p>"Fuck! Fuck! Fuck!"</p><p></p><p>The air was a bit awkward. Given the status and position of Dou Changfeng, saying "fuck" was already quite undignified.</p><p></p><p>But he just kept repeating it.</p><p></p><p>"Ahem."</p><p></p><p>Dou Tianyü cleared his throat lightly.</p><p></p><p>"Uncle, be mindful of the impact."</p><p></p><p>Dou Changfeng could not suppress his excitement, waving the item in his hand enthusiastically.</p><p></p><p>"Do you know what this is?"</p><p></p><p>"What is it?" </p><p></p><p>Ouyang Yunzhong couldn't help but feel puzzled.</p><p></p><p>Dou Changfeng spoke excitedly and solemnly:</p><p></p><p>"This is the latest design blueprint for the combat aircraft 'Star Trail' developed by the American Federation! It embodies all of the American Federation's most advanced technologies! It can be said to be the most cutting-edge combat aircraft in the world right now.</p><p></p><p>According to the internal evaluation of American scientists, it can unleash a speed and power comparable to that of a Grand Master.</p><p></p><p>They spent hundreds of billions of US dollars just on researching and manufacturing this combat aircraft. </p><p></p><p>Given its technological level, it far surpasses our Nine Prefectures, and can greatly enhance our Nine Prefectures' combat aircraft research and development capabilities, completely catching up to and even surpassing the American Federation's technology in this area. Its value is beyond measure!"</p><p></p><p>The three were silent for a moment. "Fuck!"</p><p></p><p>"Fuck!"</p><p> </p><p>"Fuck!"</p><p></p><p>The complete design blueprints for a combat aircraft comparable to a Grand Master! A top-tier technology in the field of military science! The value in this is just too great, even more valuable than the few of them sitting there.</p><p></p><p>Dou Changfeng shook his head, somewhat amused and distressed.</p><p></p><p>"You were just criticizing me, and now you're doing the same thing?"</p><p></p><p>"Can't be helped, this thing is just too shocking. I've lived for decades, and now I feel like I'm worth less than these few sheets of paper and this USB drive!"</p><p></p><p>Dou Changfeng carefully put the design blueprints back into the file folder.</p><p></p><p>"It's not just that you're worth less than them, even dozens or hundreds of Grand Masters wouldn't be worth as much as these few sheets of paper and the USB drive inside!"</p><p></p><p>"Old Dou, have you verified it? Are these design blueprints real or fake?"</p><p></p><p>"Don't worry, although I'm not an expert in military technology, I can still tell to some extent, and this thing is 90% real!"</p><p></p><p>Ouyang Yunzhong couldn't help but frown:</p><p></p><p>"But... who gave this to us? And why did they give it to us?"</p><p></p><p>Dou Changfeng also pondered for a moment.</p><p></p><p>"The other party is most likely a patriotic Grand Master expert who, by chance, obtained these design blueprints. </p><p></p><p>As for why they gave it to us, it's certainly because they are currently residing in Jianghai City."</p><p></p><p>Dou Tianyü immediately spoke up:</p><p></p><p>"That's right, the City Lord's Mansion has recently installed the latest high-precision monitoring cameras that can solve the magnetic field interference caused by Grandmaster-level experts.</p><p></p><p>In fact, they can even resolve some of the magnetic field interference from Martial Grandmaster-level experts."</p><p></p><p>Qin Shenglong's eyes lit up.</p><p></p><p>"If this good thing has been installed all over Jianghai City, wouldn't it be easy to find those few Martial Grandmasters?"</p><p></p><p>Dou Tianyü smiled wryly.</p><p></p><p>"It's not that simple. This item is of such high value that ordinary city lord's mansions don't have the qualifications to install it. I was only able to arrange it thanks to my uncle's influence. On the regular streets, it's impossible to install."</p><p></p><p>Dou Changfeng interrupted the two.</p><p></p><p>"What we need to find now is the person who sent the envelope, not those Martial Grandmasters. Tianyü, quickly pull up the surveillance footage."</p><p></p><p>"Yes, sir!"</p><p></p><p>Dou Tianyü immediately instructed his secretary to bring up the recording from that time. Just as his secretary had said, the file envelope had suddenly appeared in her hands, as if it had materialized out of thin air.</p><p></p><p>Here is the full English translation of the Chinese excerpt:</p><p></p><p>"Slow it down by ten times."</p><p></p><p>"Slow it down by twenty times."</p><p></p><p>"Slow it down even more!"</p><p></p><p>"Slow it down even more!"</p><p></p><p>"Mr. Du, it has already been slowed down to the lowest possible speed."</p><p></p><p>The secretary interrupted the group with some helplessness, and everyone fell silent again.</p><p></p><p>This was surveillance footage that even a grand master could only capture a faint shadow in!</p><p></p><p>However, they still couldn't capture the other party's figure. Were they joking with them? "Old Du, what do you think?"</p><p></p><p>Du Changfeng closed his eyes, let out a long sigh, and then spoke in a grave tone:</p><p></p><p>"If I'm not mistaken, the other party should be a Divine Patriarch!"</p><p></p><p>"What!"</p><p></p><p>The hearts of the group trembled, and their pupils even involuntarily dilated a bit in this moment.</p><p></p><p>A Divine Patriarch!</p><p></p><p>Jianghai City had gone from masters, to peak grand masters, to sub-Divine Patriarchs, and now they had even encountered a Divine Patriarch! It must be known that while grand masters were already rare, there were still quite a few of them across the Nine Realms. </p><p></p><p>But Divine Patriarchs, they were truly rare, and could be considered national treasures.</p><p></p><p>In the great calamity that had swept the Nine Realms in the past two hundred years, the official records only listed twenty-seven Divine Patriarchs!</p><p></p><p>This data was not entirely accurate, as there were also some reclusive experts, but at most it would not exceed thirty-five.</p><p></p><p>And the total number of Divine Patriarchs recorded worldwide was less than four hundred!</p><p></p><p>The population of this world was much larger than Ye Xiao's previous life, not just 6-7 billion, but 6-7 hundred billion - over ten times the population, yet it had only cultivated less than four hundred Divine Patriarch experts.</p><p></p><p>Divine Patriarchs! They were existences that could rival the gods!</p><p></p><p>A single strike from a Divine Patriarch could sweep away ten thousand meters!</p><p></p><p>Although they had speculated about the possibility of a Divine Patriarch before, it was still just speculation.</p><p></p><p>But now, Jianghai City truly had a Divine Patriarch expert!</p><p></p><p>"Who is he exactly?"</p><p></p><p>Qin Shenglong's eyes revealed a trace of admiration. Although he had lived for decades and seen the prosperity of the world, faced with a Divine Patriarch, he felt as insignificant as an ant, and couldn't help but feel envious.</p><p></p><p>"Whoever he is, from his actions, we can see that he is a reclusive expert who cares about the future of the Nine Realms! He is a senior that all of us should revere."</p><p></p><p>Du Changfeng nodded.</p><p></p><p>"Tianyu is right. Furthermore, this matter must be kept absolutely confidential. I will report it to the higher-ups immediately, including the design blueprints of this aircraft. All of you present today are absolutely forbidden from revealing this to anyone. If it is exposed, I will arrest you for leaking state security secrets, and in severe cases, I may even eliminate you. Don't blame me for being ruthless then!"</p><p></p><p>The group was shocked and immediately agreed. </p><p></p><p>This matter was too big, already beyond their ability as masters to control.</p><p></p><p>As for the instigator of this event, Ye Xiao, he was strolling with his hands in his pockets towards the library.</p><p></p><p>He naturally had no idea that they had mistaken him for a Divine Patriarch.</p><p></p><p>In reality, it was just because the speed of the Divine Incantation was too fast, already reaching and even surpassing the speed of some Divine Patriarchs, which had led to the misunderstanding.</p><p></p><p>In fact, he was still only a grand master at the fourth level of the Innate Realm.</p><p></p><p>However, there were some changes happening within him at the moment.</p>

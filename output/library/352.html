        <h1>Chapter 352</h1>
        <div class="content">
            <p>Here is the full English translation of the Chinese excerpt:</p><p></p><p>Disregarding the silly cat, Ye Xiao walked up to the group of celestial beasts and swept his gaze across them.</p><p></p><p>"Starting from today, all the offerings you provide must be increased, and it must be a significant increase.</p><p></p><p>In the coming period, I will launch an activity. During this time, the quantity of all the celestial treasures you obtain from your offerings will be one and a half times more than before.</p><p></p><p>This is a rare opportunity, I hope everyone can seize it well!"</p><p></p><p>The celestial beasts' eyes instantly lit up.</p><p></p><p>Ye Xiao had already been giving them very good things on a regular basis, but now he was directly increasing it by an additional 0.5 times.</p><p></p><p>What were they waiting for? They should immediately increase their own blood, eggs (chicken, duck, turtle), honey, milk, and other sidedishes production, right?</p><p></p><p>"Woof woof woof, long live our master!" </p><p></p><p>The excited Noel Fis even excitedly cut off one of his own tentacles to celebrate.</p><p></p><p>Ye Xiao waved his hand, signaling everyone to be quiet.</p><p></p><p>"The activity is starting now. To help you recover better, I will build more spirit gathering formations here to increase your spiritual energy absorption speed, thereby enhancing your recovery rate.</p><p></p><p>Additionally, to improve your healing speed, I will specifically seek out some healing-type celestial beasts to provide treatment for you."</p><p></p><p>"Long live our master! Long live our master!"</p><p></p><p>Seeing the excited and enthusiastic celestial beasts, Ye Xiao nodded in satisfaction.</p><p></p><p>With more celestial beasts, they became easier to control, because they were so blindly susceptible to following the trend.</p><p></p><p>When one celestial beast sees that he is giving treats to the other celestial beasts, they will also want to get the treats.</p><p></p><p>After all, they are just livestock here. Rather than being scrambled and harvested by himself every day, it would be better for them to obediently offer themselves, and they can also obtain some celestial treasures to enhance their own strength.</p><p></p><p>As the saying goes, if life knocks you down, instead of shouting and resisting, you might as well start enjoying it.</p><p></p><p>Anyway, no matter how much they shout, no one will come to save them.</p><p></p><p>After instructing Illusion Jade Glass to pay attention to the daily harvesting and storage of the celestial beasts' blood and flesh, Ye Xiao set up some formations and taught some healing techniques to certain celestial beasts before finally exiting the jade seal.</p><p></p><p>With so many celestial beasts continuously providing blood and flesh, he could accumulate a large amount of blood qi resources over time.</p><p></p><p>Then, combined with some powerful celestial cores and his own Shengluo Pill, he would definitely be able to refine a divine pill to break through his own cultivation.</p><p></p><p>However, this alone is not enough, he also needs a spirit gathering formation, a divine-level spirit gathering formation.</p><p></p><p>A divine formation!</p><p></p><p>It seems that he will be spending the next few days immersed in the Martial Dao Library.</p><p></p><p>After Ye Xiao left, the Great Emperor Dragon Lion slowly opened his mouth and chatted with the Sovereign Realm Celestial Beast King Dragon beside him.</p><p></p><p>"Have you noticed anything?"</p><p></p><p>The Celestial Beast King Dragon spoke slowly:</p><p></p><p>"If I'm not mistaken, this guy is about to advance again, he's about to break through to the Divine Realm! Otherwise, he wouldn't have us increase the blood and flesh supply so quickly."</p><p></p><p>The Great Emperor Dragon Lion's eyes narrowed, and he couldn't help but shudder at those two words.</p><p></p><p>The Divine Realm! Even these Sovereign Realm celestial beasts had to look up to it in reverence.</p><p></p><p>"If I remember correctly, this guy should have just broken through to the Emperor Realm not long ago, about two years ago.</p><p></p><p>In just two years! Two years! He has already become so powerful! He's about to advance to the Divine Realm!"</p><p></p><p>"How ruthless!"</p><p></p><p>"But the biggest problem now is not this, but something else."</p><p></p><p>The Great Emperor Dragon Lion frowned, looking puzzled:</p><p></p><p>"What problem?"</p><p></p><p>"Have you ever thought about it? If his strength advances one more step and reaches the Divine Realm, will he still need the blood qi we provide?"</p><p></p><p>Boom! This sentence was like a huge bomb exploding in the Great Emperor Dragon Lion's mind, making him shudder involuntarily.</p><p></p><p>If that's the case, doesn't it mean they are not far from death?</p><p></p><p>"Gulp."</p><p></p><p>The Great Emperor Dragon Lion couldn't help but swallow a mouthful of saliva.</p><p></p><p>"Celestial Beast King Dragon, what should we do?"</p><p></p><p>The Celestial Beast King Dragon took a deep breath, exhaling a crimson snake's tongue, his eyes revealing a strong sense of determination.</p><p></p><p>"We must also work harder to cultivate, making our blood qi more abundant, and our flesh more delicious and tender. Only in this way will we continue to be needed by him.</p><p></p><p>I don't want to end up like Dorfis and Tyrant Ape, being slaughtered by him without even a chance of resurrection, just directly waiting to be refined into a medicinal pill."</p><p></p><p>The Great Emperor Dragon Lion nodded.</p><p></p><p>"Well said. Even as livestock, we cannot be negligent, we must strive for progress and constantly improve ourselves to become stronger."</p><p></p><p>"To be better livestock, we two must encourage each other, work hard together. As long as we are the strongest celestial beasts in this spatial treasure, it will be them who die."</p><p></p><p>"Good! Let's start cultivating now."</p><p></p><p>But what they didn't notice was that many other celestial beasts had also noticed this point. At this moment, all the celestial beasts inside the jade seal were secretly competing, trying to improve the quality of their offerings and blood qi.</p><p></p><p>Ye Xiao's advancement goal had indirectly driven the internal competition within the entire celestial beast farm.</p><p></p><p>The next day...</p><p></p><p>Here is the full English translation of the Chinese excerpt:</p><p></p><p>Ye Xiao went to work and began to search for the formation.</p><p></p><p>Before long, accompanied by a pleasant fragrance of gardenia, Qin Yuyan, with her soft long hair, appeared before him.</p><p></p><p>"Ye Xiao, long time no see." Ye Xiao looked up, from this angle, he could only see half of Qin Yuyan's face.</p><p></p><p>Because there were two obstacles that were too large, seriously obstructing his vision.</p><p></p><p>"What brings you here?"</p><p></p><p>Qin Yuyan smiled softly, her big eyes crescent-shaped like a crescent moon.</p><p></p><p>"Can't I come?"</p><p></p><p>But saying this, it seemed to have a slight hint of coquetry, so Qin Yuyan blushed slightly and changed the subject.</p><p></p><p>"I came here to look for some books. Do you have any books on breaking into tombs?"</p><p></p><p>"Breaking into tombs? You mean books on tomb raiding, right?"</p><p></p><p>Ye Xiao's mind recalled Ghost Blows Out the Light and Grave Robbers' Chronicles.</p><p></p><p>Qin Yuyan was amused.</p><p></p><p>"What do you mean by tomb raiding? I'm just going to excavate some ancient tombs."</p><p></p><p>Hearing this, Ye Xiao's gaze flashed with a strange color. Ancient tombs, could it be that "Why did you suddenly think of looking for such books?"</p><p></p><p>"Now in the starry sky, many ancient tombs have been discovered. Some even contain the tombs of deicide experts!</p><p></p><p>The Xuanyuan Clan is fighting fiercely with the Thunder Clan, the Wing Clan, and the Giant Ape Clan to compete for these ancient tombs.</p><p></p><p>The Xuanyuan Clan, in order to seize the time! To quickly excavate the heritage in the tombs, they have already begun to mobilize the human experts on the ground.</p><p></p><p>As long as one's cultivation has broken through to the Divine Sect realm, they can sign up to enter the starry sky to dig tombs, and they can get many good things.</p><p></p><p>I also want to go and see if I can encounter some special opportunities."</p><p></p><p>Hearing this, Ye Xiao felt much more at ease.</p><p></p><p>As long as it's not the Divine Treasure Vault, there's no big problem.</p><p></p><p>However, this matter also gave him a warning.</p><p></p><p>That is, if those divine tombs are from the ancient divine realm, their tombs must contain some special information.</p><p></p><p>For example, information related to the Divine Treasure Vault.</p><p></p><p>He must find a way to quickly improve his own strength, and then find the Divine Treasure Vault, and dig up the benefits inside.</p><p></p><p>Get ahead of everyone else and obtain the benefits inside.</p><p></p><p>"As for tomb excavation, the most common thing encountered is formations. You can first look at some formation-related books, these are the ones I just read, you can take a look and get a basic understanding.</p><p></p><p>In addition to these, you can also look at mechanism techniques, poison techniques, and illusion techniques.</p><p></p><p>Usually, the most common things in a tomb are these.</p><p></p><p>As for the guardian spirits that may exist, that all depends on one's strength to resolve. There is no such knowledge in the books."</p><p></p><p>Ye Xiao briefly explained to her.</p><p></p><p>After all, the relationship between the two was still passable, he couldn't just watch her rush in and get killed, right? Qin Yuyan nodded and smiled faintly:</p><p></p><p>"Thank you, if I dig up anything good, I'll definitely give you a share."</p><p></p><p>"No need to be so polite."</p><p></p><p>Ye Xiao continued to read his book, and Qin Yuyan sat across from him reading books, the two of them no longer interacting, both very quiet.</p><p></p><p>The two of them were the type who liked to focus on their own business, once they started doing something, they rarely disturbed each other.</p><p></p><p>Over the next few days, Qin Yuyan would come to read books, the two of them reading their own books without disturbing each other.</p><p></p><p>After about a month, Ye Xiao finally found the last imperial formation he needed.</p><p></p><p>Inputting the imperial formation into the golden book, waiting to cultivate to the great perfection realm, he could directly synthesize a divine formation! Perfect.</p><p></p><p>After learning the formations, Ye Xiao pushed the books in front of him to Qin Yuyan's side.</p><p></p><p>"I've finished reading all of these, you can continue reading them, I have some things to go out for."</p><p></p><p>Qin Yuyan nodded.</p><p></p><p>"I'll finish this and then go back. Prepare to postpone the elite class course and sign up to go to the starry sky battlefield."</p><p></p><p>The two bid farewell to each other, Ye Xiao left the library and immediately began to prepare.</p><p></p><p>He didn't need to worry too much about the issue of spirit pills, because he had enough star beast cores and flesh and blood, the blood qi contained was terrifyingly powerful, enough for him to handle divine pills.</p><p></p><p>What he needed now was to make the divine crystals for the formations.</p><p></p><p>Divine crystals are an advanced version of spirit stones, brought over from the higher star domains by the Xuanyuan Clan.</p><p></p><p>The spiritual energy contained in them is many times stronger than spirit stones.</p><p></p><p>Only by using this kind of thing can one activate the divine formations.</p><p></p><p>However, this thing is not easy to obtain, only those elites favored by the Xuanyuan Clan can obtain it.</p><p></p><p>Of course, ordinary people also have a way to obtain it.</p><p></p><p>With the interconnection between the Xuanyuan Clan and this world, many clan merchants, in order to earn more profits, will choose to exchange divine crystals and spirit stones.</p><p></p><p>The profit margin in between is very large.</p><p></p><p>One more update, three thousand.</p><p></p><p>Seeking recommendations, seeking monthly votes.</p><p></p><p>Thank you to the reader "I wish to know you" for the reward, greatly appreciated.</p><p></p><p>(This chapter is complete)</p>

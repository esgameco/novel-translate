        <h1>Chapter 3</h1>
        <div class="content">
            <p>Here is the full English translation of the Chinese excerpt:</p><p></p><p>The one calling out was named Gu Hai, a slightly chubby young man from the local area of Jianghai City, a few centimeters shorter than Ye Xiao at 173 cm, but from a well-off family.</p><p></p><p>His area of management in the library was the second-floor B area, so he was often referred to as "Er Bi" (Second Floor B).</p><p></p><p>Fortunately, Gu Hai had an outgoing personality and didn't bother getting into disputes with his colleagues, so he was considered the cheerful one among them.</p><p></p><p>"He's here," Ye Xiao responded softly and got up to walk towards the stairs.</p><p></p><p>The moment he saw Gu Hai, his gaze shifted slightly.</p><p></p><p>Gu Hai had broken through! It turned out he was only a post-Heavenly Realm Second-Grade Warrior before.</p><p></p><p>But now, he had advanced to a post-Heavenly Realm Third-Grade Warrior, rising one rank.</p><p></p><p>Gu Hai wasn't exactly a waste. He had awakened his divine soul early on, and his talent was decent, but his parents didn't want him to join the military or a mercenary company to hunt star beasts. After all, Gu was their only child, so they used their connections to get him a job as a librarian.</p><p></p><p>In his mother's words, the library had a lot of people and light work, making it easier to find a partner.</p><p></p><p>But Ye Xiao didn't say anything, because only high-level warriors could see through the aura of lower-level ones. If he said anything, wouldn't that reveal his own strength?</p><p></p><p>In the past half year, Ye Xiao had never come into close contact with any experts. Even during the manager's meetings, he always sat in the furthest corner, fully suppressing his aura.</p><p></p><p>He had heard that reaching the Grandmaster realm would allow one to completely conceal their cultivation, making it impossible for anyone to see through.</p><p></p><p>By then, he wouldn't have to worry about being discovered anymore.</p><p></p><p>The two walked together towards the cafeteria, and Gu Hai nudged Ye Xiao with his elbow.</p><p></p><p>"Old Ye, have you heard? The Jianghai Martial Arts Academy is going to have a big shot come and give a lecture. I heard he's a professor from the Jingzhou Martial Arts Academy! I'll get us two student IDs so we can go listen to the lecture together."</p><p></p><p>"Jingzhou Martial Arts Academy? Isn't that supposedly the best martial arts academy in the Nine Realms?"</p><p></p><p>"Of course! The Jingzhou Martial Arts Academy is the top brand in our Nine Realms! It's ranked number one nationally! If we can attend that professor's lecture, our cultivation will definitely skyrocket! You'll at least break through to Second-Grade Warrior, no problem!"</p><p></p><p>Ye Xiao wasn't actually that interested in this. As long as he read through a cultivation technique once, his divine soul would automatically cultivate and upgrade. He didn't need to cultivate at all.</p><p></p><p>However, he had been transmigrated for half a year now, stuck in a three-point-one-line routine without ever leaving the library. Going out to take a look wouldn't be a bad idea.</p><p></p><p>"Okay."</p><p></p><p>"It's settled then. I'll figure out a way to get the student IDs, and you don't need to pay. Just treat me to a foot massage at the Red Wave Romance tonight."</p><p></p><p>Ye Xiao pondered for a moment before responding, "Alright, I'll treat you to the Red Wave Romance, but you give me the key to the second-floor B area. I want to go read some books there tonight."</p><p></p><p>Ye Xiao definitely wouldn't go to a place like that. He had already read through most of the books in his own area, and he still hadn't gathered enough of a basic cultivation technique to perform a fusion upgrade. </p><p></p><p>During the day, he only had a maximum of eight rest days per month to go read in other areas. If he could go to the second-floor B area tonight, he might just find another harvest.</p><p></p><p>Gu Hai raised his eyebrows.</p><p></p><p>"Old Ye, you don't have some kind of problem down there, do you? Why are you going to read books at night instead of going to the Red Wave Romance? Have you gone crazy? Or should I introduce you to an old Chinese medicine doctor? My friend goes to see him regularly, and the results are great."</p><p></p><p>"Great results from going regularly? Sounds like a problem to me."</p><p></p><p>Gu Hai's face twitched involuntarily, and he pondered, "Wait, you're not actually having that kind of problem, are you?"</p><p></p><p>"I'm not at the age to be drinking wolfberry yet. As for you, in your youth, you don't know the value of those precious things. Be careful, or you'll end up crying when you're old.</p><p></p><p>After all, even the hardest steel can't withstand the corrosion of seawater."</p><p></p><p>Gu Hai thumped his chest, his face flushing.</p><p></p><p>Here is the full English translation of the excerpt from the Chinese novel:</p><p></p><p>Brimming with self-confidence.</p><p></p><p>"Don't worry, brother, I'm made of synthetic steel. No matter what kind of seawater, it can't corrode my iron-willed determination!"</p><p></p><p>Ye Xiao didn't say much.</p><p></p><p>Men's stubbornness is a common ailment, they'll eventually soften up. He shook his head, shaking off the jumbled thoughts in his mind, and spoke again:</p><p></p><p>"Just say whether you're willing or not."</p><p></p><p>"Of course I'm willing! Such a good opportunity, only a fool wouldn't want it. Here are my keys, I won't lock the door tonight. After you finish reading, remember to lock the door for me."</p><p></p><p>"Understood."</p><p></p><p>Ye Xiao took the keys from Gu Hai's hand and transferred four hundred yuan to him.</p><p></p><p>But thinking about it, worried that he might spend too much and contract some unsavory habits, he transferred a few more hundred.</p><p></p><p>That night, the library was closed and shrouded in silence and darkness.</p><p></p><p>Ye Xiao came to the second-floor B area and walked straight in, starting to select books from the shelves to read.</p><p></p><p>Since he didn't have much time, only about one night, he specifically chose to read sword technique manuals.</p><p></p><p>His sword techniques had already mastered six basic manuals, the most among all types of techniques, and the type with the most hope of quickly synthesizing stronger techniques.</p><p></p><p>Ye Xiao didn't turn on the lights. After breaking through the ninth level of the Warrior realm, his physical fitness had long surpassed that of ordinary people, and his night vision could even allow him to see the books clearly in the darkness.</p><p></p><p>He gradually spread out a pile of sword technique manuals and read them one by one.</p><p></p><p>The first one was related to the Ming Luo Sword Technique, both belonging to the same lineage of sword-drawing techniques! The second one was related to the Chen Family Sword Technique, both being chopping sword techniques.</p><p></p><p>He thoroughly read more than two hundred basic sword technique manuals, and they were all related to the six basic sword techniques he was currently cultivating, sharing the same origins.</p><p></p><p>By this time, it was already the latter part of the night, and the moon had risen on the western horizon. Ye Xiao let out a long sigh.</p><p></p><p>These plagiarists were really too much, weren't they? How many basic technique manuals had they copied? Changing the family name to Wang or Zhang, slightly modifying a move or two, and suddenly it became a new technique.</p><p></p><p>Even more shameless, some sword techniques were directly called "First-rate Sword Technique" or "Second-rate Sword Technique," when in reality they were all the same type of technique.</p><p></p><p>Truly money-grabbing without any shame! There was no other choice, he had already spent a lot of money. If he just left, that would be too much of a loss.</p><p></p><p>He could only sigh as he put the technique manuals back one by one and searched for new ones.</p><p></p><p>When returning the books, he suddenly noticed a sword technique manual hidden in the corner at the bottom of a bookshelf.</p><p></p><p>Raising his eyebrows slightly, he pulled it out and brushed off the dust.</p><p></p><p>Puff puff~.</p><p></p><p>As the dust scattered, several big characters came into view:</p><p></p><p>"Ma Family Sword Technique - Five Lightning Strikes!"</p><p></p><p>"What a pretentious sword technique name."</p><p></p><p>Ye Xiao felt a bit exasperated, the name was so long and pompous. But he had never seen this technique before, so he didn't know if it was a new basic sword technique.</p><p></p><p>He opened the first page, which boldly proclaimed it to be the masterpiece of a renowned master, the pinnacle of the techniques of connection, transformation, and release.</p><p></p><p>After the lengthy introduction, the main text began.</p><p></p><p>To Ye Xiao's surprise, as soon as he started reading the main text, the divine book in his mind stirred and recorded it.</p><p></p><p>Ye Xiao's expression brightened, it was indeed an independent basic sword technique! He immediately began to read it carefully.</p><p></p><p>An hour later, the seven pages in the divine book that recorded the seven basic sword techniques started to flicker with a golden glow.</p><p></p><p>Ye Xiao's usually calm demeanor was now tinged with excitement.</p><p></p><p>"It's done!"</p><p></p><p>(End of this chapter)</p>

        <h1>Chapter 86</h1>
        <div class="content">
            <p>Here is the full English translation of the Chinese excerpt:</p><p></p><p>The Shadow Snake was very intelligent.</p><p></p><p>Many years ago, when it was on the verge of extinction, it hid its soul within the body of Fa Zheng, using Fa Zheng's growing strength to eventually seize control of Fa Zheng's body, so that it could directly obtain the body of a powerful human cultivator.</p><p></p><p>And now, when it encountered an existence whose strength it might not know, it did not hesitate at all, and the first thing it chose to do was to flee.</p><p></p><p>But it didn't realize one problem - could it really escape?</p><p></p><p>From the moment Ye Xiao activated the Taixuan Tiangong, he had already completely locked onto it.</p><p></p><p>When it tried to flee, Ye Xiao's attack was launched in an instant.</p><p></p><p>Boom! The Taixuan Tiangong charged forward like a thunderbolt, ruthlessly crushing the soul of the Shadow Snake.</p><p></p><p>In just a moment, the Shadow Snake's soul was shattered into fragments.</p><p></p><p>Fa Zheng's originally suppressed soul immediately reacted, seizing the opportunity to expel the fragments of the Shadow Snake's soul from his body.</p><p></p><p>In an instant, Fa Zheng's body emitted a dazzling golden light, illuminating the entire room.</p><p></p><p>Ye Xiao stretched and rolled over, pulling the blanket over himself and entering a dream.</p><p></p><p>Soon after, Fa Zheng slowly opened his eyes.</p><p></p><p>The compassion in his gaze had fully returned, and all the gloominess had disappeared without a trace.</p><p></p><p>Not only that, but there was also a new determination in his eyes.</p><p></p><p>His martial dao heart had been firmly re-established at this moment.</p><p></p><p>Glancing at the neighboring bed where Ye Xiao and Yuanliu were sleeping, Fa Zheng gently exhaled, murmuring a Buddhist chant.</p><p></p><p>"Amitabha."</p><p></p><p>He then continued his seated meditation and contemplation.</p><p></p><p>The night passed quickly, and the next morning, the two had a delicious breakfast and resumed their work of slaying demons and eliminating evil.</p><p></p><p>The entire activity lasted a full ten days.</p><p></p><p>After ten days, the two returned to the library.</p><p></p><p>Librarian Ouyang Yunzhong personally greeted them at the main entrance.</p><p></p><p>"Master Fa Zheng, you have been working hard these past few days."</p><p></p><p>Fa Zheng clasped his hands and bowed with a smile. "Amitabha, the librarian is too kind. This poor monk has also gained quite a bit in these ten days."</p><p></p><p>"The City Lord and the Southern Palace Commander have set up a grand feast at the Jianghai City Grand Hotel."</p><p></p><p>"Amitabha, the City Lord's kindness is appreciated by this poor monk, but I still need to hurry to the next city, so I must decline the invitation."</p><p></p><p>Ouyang Yunzhong, knowing that Fa Zheng was not the type to indulge in worldly affairs, did not try to persuade him further, and simply smiled and said, "If that is the case, I wish the master a safe journey."</p><p></p><p>Fa Zheng nodded, then turned to Ye Xiao and took out a handwritten cultivation manual from his sleeve.</p><p></p><p>"Benefactor Ye, these past few days, thank you for guiding this poor monk. As a parting gift, this poor monk has hand-copied a Shaolin body cultivation technique, the Golden Bell Cover, and presents it to Benefactor Ye."</p><p></p><p>Ye Xiao accepted the cultivation manual.</p><p></p><p>"Then I won't keep the master any longer."</p><p></p><p>"Benefactor Ye, this poor monk still maintains that your heart and nature are excellent, and you have an affinity with the Buddha. If you have the opportunity in the future, you should go to the Shaolin Wudao Academy and try it."</p><p></p><p>Ye Xiao smiled calmly. "If I go to the Shaolin Wudao Academy to cultivate martial arts, wouldn't that ruin this state of mind?"</p><p></p><p>Fa Zheng paused, then smiled and nodded.</p><p></p><p>"This poor monk did not think of that. The mountains are high and the roads are long, so we shall part ways here. Until we meet again."</p><p></p><p>"Until we meet again."</p><p></p><p>The two bid farewell, and Ye Xiao and Ouyang Yunzhong watched as Fa Zheng's figure disappeared.</p><p></p><p>Here is the full English translation of the Chinese excerpt:</p><p></p><p>As the sun was setting, the figure of Fa Zheng was cast in a long shadow.</p><p></p><p>He was like an ascetic monk, insignificant among the crowd, unassuming and unobtrusive. But a single glance at his shadow could infect one with the steadfastness and determination that emanated from him, calming even the most restless of hearts.</p><p></p><p>"It seems you and Master Fa Zheng get along quite well," Ouyang Yunzhong remarked with a smile after Fa Zheng had walked away.</p><p></p><p>"It's alright," Ye Xiao replied.</p><p></p><p>"Master Fa Zheng holds a prestigious position at the Shaolin Martial Arts Academy. Although you've always been more Buddhist-inclined, not seeking fame or profit, sometimes you still need to strive for it. There are opportunities that are rare and fleeting; if you miss them, you may never have another chance in your lifetime."</p><p></p><p>It was clear that Ouyang Yunzhong was also trying to persuade Ye Xiao.</p><p></p><p>The Shaolin Martial Arts Academy was the most prestigious martial arts institution in Chuzhou, and one of the top-ranked in the Nine Prefectures. Fa Zheng was a veteran professor there, and having his recognition and support would not only secure Ye Xiao's promising future, but also vastly improve his current circumstances.</p><p></p><p>Yet Ye Xiao remained unmoved, simply handing over his car keys and bank card to Dean Ouyang.</p><p></p><p>"Striving for fame and profit is too tiring. I'll just continue being a librarian."</p><p></p><p>Dean Ouyang shook his head helplessly. Ye Xiao was excellent in every way, except for this temperament of his - he was just too Buddhist-like.</p><p></p><p>Spending all day holed up in the library, without any desires or ambitions. At this rate, the poor child might end up living a solitary life, forever a bachelor.</p><p></p><p>"I believe his parents were heroic warriors who died on the star battlefield. He's had it hard, being all alone in the world."</p><p></p><p>Suddenly, a thought occurred to him. "Speaking of which, my second sister has been asking me to find a suitor for her granddaughter. Maybe I should introduce Ye Xiao to her?"</p><p></p><p>Meanwhile, in the underground sewers of the city of Jiang Hai, several dark figures had gathered.</p><p></p><p>"We've found out that the old bald-headed monk from Shaolin has gone to the neighboring city."</p><p></p><p>"Damn it, he's finally left. I've been on edge these past few days, afraid to even sleep, worried that I might get caught."</p><p></p><p>"Before each 'Seven Stars Convergence', the humans always conduct a cleansing operation. This time, we brothers in Jiang Hai have almost wiped them all out. We can't just let this debt of blood go unpaid."</p><p></p><p>"That's right! The humans must pay in blood for their crimes. But the 'Seven Stars Convergence' has not yet arrived, and our strength has not yet reached its peak. It's not the right time to make a big move against the humans."</p><p></p><p>"However, we can still collect a little 'interest' first. The young man who guided the old bald-headed monk from Shaolin is only a mid-stage Qi Warrior. Let's start by carving him up, to appease the spirits of our fallen brothers!"</p><p></p><p>"Great idea! I'll tear him to pieces and devour him alive!"</p><p></p><p>"Flay him, skin him, and boil him into a soup! Make him wish for death, but unable to die, suffering for eternity as a dog's lackey!"</p><p></p><p>Unaware that he had been targeted, Ye Xiao returned home and began studying the Golden Bell Cover that Fa Zheng had given him.</p><p></p><p>As soon as he had obtained the Golden Bell Cover, the divine spirit within his body had stirred with excitement. It was clear that this was the final cultivation technique he had been searching for, the foundation of the Body Refining system.</p><p></p><p>After mastering this technique, he would be able to forge a top-tier Body Refining cultivation method. He wondered what powerful Body Refining technique he would gain this time.</p>

        <h1>Chapter 193</h1>
        <div class="content">
            <p>Here is the full English translation of the Chinese excerpt:</p><p></p><p>Ye Xiao waved his hand.</p><p></p><p>"Don't worry! This time I'm here, it has nothing to do with you."</p><p></p><p>The group of star beasts all looked at Ye Xiao with puzzled expressions. </p><p></p><p>Has nothing to do with them? </p><p></p><p>Then what is it about? And is it something important enough for him to come personally? The next moment, the star beasts saw Ye Xiao bring in three more star beasts whose auras were even stronger than theirs!</p><p></p><p>"This is..."</p><p></p><p>"Fuck!"</p><p></p><p>"Fuck, fuck, fuck!"</p><p></p><p>The divine lord star beasts instantly went crazy! Was he joking with them? Ye Xiao had actually brought in a few more star beasts, and these three star beasts were even stronger than them.</p><p></p><p>Wow, just how powerful is this guy? There's no limit to his abilities?</p><p></p><p>Mo Yu, Iron Ox and Su Shan also looked bewildered, completely at a loss.</p><p></p><p>What's going on? Why are there so many star beasts here? </p><p></p><p>And each of these star beasts is stronger than the divine lord level? Are they dreaming?</p><p></p><p>After Ye Xiao brought in the three star beasts, he slowly spoke:</p><p></p><p>"From now on, this will be the place where you three will stay. The rules will be taught to you by them.</p><p></p><p>Starting from tomorrow, you three will start working normally. I don't need much, just honey, milk, and shells. </p><p></p><p>If I don't see these three things, they will teach you the consequences."</p><p></p><p>With that, Ye Xiao turned and left, beginning to reinforce the sealing formation.</p><p></p><p>After all, three more innate eighth-grade divine lord star beasts had entered, so the original formation was definitely not strong enough.</p><p></p><p>The original formation, Ye Xiao had only carved the sealing, and last time, it was broken through by that left protector of the Beast God Sect, using some unknown method.</p><p></p><p>So this time, he would add spirit stones, a material containing a vast amount of spiritual energy, to rearrange and reinforce the formation.</p><p></p><p>With these materials added, not only these star beasts, even if several times more came, Ye Xiao would not have to worry at all.</p><p></p><p>After doing all this, Ye Xiao finally left.</p><p></p><p>It was almost dawn, he could go up and have some breakfast, then start working.</p><p></p><p>And just after he left, several figures immediately flew to the airspace above the library.</p><p></p><p>Liu Chengxun, Du Changfeng, Fa Zheng, Le Xinling, Lian Chimu - any big shots in the Jianghai City, or even some powerful experts from the surrounding areas, had rushed over at the fastest speed.</p><p></p><p>"What's going on? The speed of spiritual energy absorption in the entire Jianghai City has increased a lot again?"</p><p></p><p>"Not just a lot, it's practically doubled."</p><p></p><p>"It must be that there's a problem with the spiritual energy gathering formation below! Fa Zheng, this formation belongs to your Shaolin, can you find out what's going on below?"</p><p></p><p>Fa Zheng bitterly smiled.</p><p></p><p>"I've already said before, this formation has been rearranged by Senior Sword Immortal, and it's even an imperial formation.</p><p></p><p>Not only us, even if we bring all the formation masters most proficient in formations from Shaolin, they might not be able to break this formation.</p><p></p><p>So no one can know what's happening below."</p><p></p><p>Liu Chengxun spoke:</p><p></p><p>"The spiritual energy gathering formation mainly relies on the power of high-level star beasts, and last night, Senior Sword Immortal just slaughtered three innate eighth-grade star beasts.</p><p></p><p>Plus, this formation was arranged by him personally.</p><p></p><p>If I guess correctly, he should have placed all those star beast corpses inside this seal.</p><p></p><p>That's why the spiritual energy absorption in Jianghai City has increased."</p><p></p><p>Everyone was shocked and excited, their faces flushed red.</p><p></p><p>"Yes! How come we didn't think of that? We only thought this matter might be related to Senior Sword Immortal, but we didn't think the enhancement of the spiritual energy gathering formation might be related to those star beasts inside it.</p><p></p><p>Now it seems that Senior Sword Immortal must have sealed all the high-level star beasts he has slaughtered so far inside here."</p><p></p><p>"Now the speed of spiritual energy absorption in Jianghai City has reached the level of those first-tier cities. It seems Jianghai City's development is just around the corner."</p><p></p><p>The crowd was excited.</p><p></p><p>The ability and speed of a city to absorb spiritual energy plays a fundamental role in the city's development. </p><p></p><p>If a city lacks spiritual energy, no one would want to go there, as cultivators need spiritual energy the most for cultivation.</p><p></p><p>On the contrary, the more spiritual energy a city has, the more spiritual energy cultivators can absorb to increase their cultivation speed, and the more the population will gather there.</p><p></p><p>"Jianghai City is truly a blessed city!" </p><p></p><p>Liu Chengxun couldn't help but sigh deeply.</p><p></p><p>There are countless cities in the world that are constantly trying to increase their spiritual energy absorption speed.</p><p></p><p>But Jianghai City, just a small city, can have such powerful spiritual energy absorption, it's truly blessed by the heavens.</p><p></p><p>"No, Senior Sword Liu, I think you're wrong," Du Changfeng smiled.</p><p></p><p>"It's because we have Senior Sword Immortal as our lucky star! With the blessings of the lucky star, that's why Jianghai City can be like this today."</p><p></p><p>Liu Chengxun nodded, agreeing with his words.</p><p></p><p>"You're right. The true blessing of Jianghai City lies in Senior Sword Immortal!"</p><p></p><p>While the humans above were overjoyed, the star beasts below were dumbfounded.</p><p></p><p>"So you mean, that human bastard! Raising us up, is actually wanting to...</p><p></p><p>Here is the full English translation of the Chinese excerpt:</p><p></p><p>"Domestic fowl?" </p><p></p><p>Susan exclaimed in disbelief!</p><p></p><p>The other star beasts nodded seriously. "Is he crazy? Is he out of his mind? What makes him think that we, the mighty Celestial Ancestor Star Beasts, the experts of the Star Beast Tribe, would willingly become his domestic fowl?</p><p></p><p>We are highly intelligent beings!</p><p></p><p>We possess immense power!</p><p></p><p>It is the human race that should be our domestic fowl. There is no way we would ever become the domestic fowl of humans.</p><p></p><p>Let him go dream his grand illusions."</p><p></p><p>Susan was so angry she coughed up blood!</p><p></p><p>Who was she? She was the mighty Celestial Ancestor Star Beast under the Tiger God! Commanding the winds and clouds, who dared to provoke her? With a single order, hundreds of thousands of star beasts would submit!</p><p></p><p>What was Ye Xiao? Just an insignificant junior of the human race.</p><p></p><p>Even if his strength surpassed hers, she would never compromise.</p><p></p><p>She had her own dignity!</p><p></p><p>The dignity of a great general under the Tiger God! The other star beasts looked at each other and couldn't help but say:</p><p></p><p>"We think you should just obediently become a domestic fowl, don't provoke that guy and cause trouble for everyone."</p><p></p><p>Susan sneered coldly.</p><p></p><p>"Do you think I'm as spineless as you? As a mighty Celestial Ancestor Star Beast, how can you so blatantly disregard your own face and the dignity of the Star Beast Tribe, becoming a domestic fowl for humans. </p><p></p><p>It's utterly shameful!"</p><p></p><p>Ji Feng slowly spoke:</p><p></p><p>"At first, I also had the same mindset as you, but now, aren't I still obediently laying eggs every day?"</p><p></p><p>Susan scoffed.</p><p></p><p>"Heh, can you compare to me? I'm a Celestial Ancestor of the Eighth Realm, while you're only a Celestial Ancestor of the Seventh Realm.</p><p></p><p>Between the Eighth Realm and the Seventh Realm, the gap is as vast as the heavens and the earth."</p><p></p><p>Ji Feng shook his head helplessly and pointed to Noel Fei in the distance.</p><p></p><p>"Look, this senior Noel Fei, his true body is a Celestial Ancestor of the Ninth Realm. </p><p></p><p>No matter how powerful you are at the Eighth Realm, you can't possibly be stronger than him. Now he's obediently listening, do you think you have any reason to be arrogant? Even if you were at the Ninth Realm, as long as you can't defeat him, you'd still have to obediently become a domestic fowl."</p><p></p><p>"What if I absolutely refuse to do it?"</p><p></p><p>"Then you'll die a miserable death! No, it's not that you'll die, but that you won't be able to live or die. That guy has three Emperor-level healing arts, no matter what method you use to die, he can revive you. Unless you can completely blow yourself up, leaving not even a speck of ash behind.</p><p></p><p>But inside this seal, you definitely can't do that, because we won't allow you to self-destruct, or else we'll all be blown up together."</p><p></p><p>Susan gritted her teeth, a hint of fear flashing in her eyes.</p><p></p><p>For any sentient being, mortal or beast, the most agonizing thing was to be unable to live or die.</p><p></p><p>However, she absolutely could not yield so easily.</p><p></p><p>If she gave in once, Ye Xiao would demand it again and again, endlessly! So she must firmly defend her first time.</p><p></p><p>She looked at her two companions.</p><p></p><p>"Tomorrow, we'll all ignore him and see what he does. If he thinks he can conquer us with a few little tricks, then he's greatly underestimating us.</p><p></p><p>The great generals under the Tiger God are not cowards!"</p><p></p><p>Iron Ox and Ink Jade nodded.</p><p></p><p>Susan was right, they must hold firm to their bottom line.</p><p></p><p>Ye Xiao wanted to turn them into domestic fowl, but they would stubbornly refuse to be domestic fowl.</p><p></p><p>This was not just about their dignity, but also closely related to their health and cultivation.</p><p></p><p>Whether it was Ink Jade producing milk or Iron Ox cracking shells, it would greatly harm their bodies.</p><p></p><p>Those were the precious essences they had refined with their own cultivation and vitality, how could they casually hand them over?</p><p></p><p>So what if they got beaten? </p><p></p><p>They had already been beaten countless times.</p><p></p><p>As long as they gritted their teeth and endured a few more times, Ye Xiao should give up.</p><p></p><p>Then they would find a way to escape this place.</p><p></p><p>Time flew by, and soon it was the next day.</p><p></p><p>Within the Golden Book's divine sense, the Monarch Extreme Sword Art had been completely cultivated, and Ye Xiao tested it a little.</p><p></p><p>The Monarch Extreme Sword Art had a different nature from the Heavenly Slashing Sword.</p><p></p><p>The Heavenly Slashing Sword concentrated all the power into a single attack.</p><p></p><p>While the Monarch Extreme Sword Art continuously increased the power of the sword art with each successive attack.</p><p></p><p>This was a bit like the Unique Sword of the Wuxia novels.</p><p></p><p>One sword strike stronger than the last!</p><p></p><p>Compared to it, the Monarch Extreme Sword Art was even a bit stronger.</p><p></p><p>But its strength lay in the later stages, in the early stages it was not that powerful, which was why earlier when he fought against Susan, the Heavenly Slashing Sword could shatter so many of her sword beams.</p>

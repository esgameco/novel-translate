        <h1>Chapter 79</h1>
        <div class="content">
            <p>Here is the full English translation of the excerpt from the Chinese novel:</p><p></p><p>After the meal, Ye Xiao bid farewell to the others and went home.</p><p></p><p>The others couldn't help but reveal envious expressions.</p><p></p><p>"I really envy Manager Ye, his salary is high, and he can rent a house outside."</p><p></p><p>"That's right, living alone is so great, and he can even find a girlfriend. The dorms in the library don't allow you to bring outsiders in."</p><p></p><p>"Then you can find a colleague in the library, problem solved, right?"</p><p></p><p>"What a crooked melon and rotten wood, can you even get a girlfriend?"</p><p></p><p>"Turn off the lights, you're the goddess of the group."</p><p></p><p>Listening to their discussion, Ning Yuthen thought that he should also go out and rent a house.</p><p></p><p>He had thought about this problem before, because his bloodline was special, and if he lived with others, it would be very dangerous if it was exposed.</p><p></p><p>"The manager said before that the house he rented in the suburbs was only a hundred bucks a month. I should be able to afford it too."</p><p></p><p>Thinking about this, Ning Yuthen left the library and went to a nearby real estate agency.</p><p></p><p>"Hello, miss, welcome, welcome."</p><p></p><p>The customer manager immediately came forward to greet him, but Ning Yuthen's face was slightly gloomy as he said, "I'm a man."</p><p></p><p>The customer manager's smile froze for a moment, then he forced a smile again to ease the awkwardness.</p><p></p><p>"Ah, the sir looks so delicate, please come in, please come in, let me get you some water."</p><p></p><p>Ning Yuthen snorted coldly and walked into the store. The other party quickly poured him a cup of water and then asked, "May I ask if the sir wants to buy or sell a house?"</p><p></p><p>"Can't afford to buy, and don't have a house to sell, I want to rent."</p><p></p><p>Ning Yuthen picked up the disposable cup and took a sip of mineral water, and the other party smiled and asked again, "Then what price range are you looking for? Do you have any requirements for the location?"</p><p></p><p>"Hmm, the suburbs will do, something cheaper."</p><p></p><p>"Okay, the rent in the suburbs is generally between 800 and 1,200, I wonder what your expected price range is?"</p><p></p><p>Ning Yuthen couldn't help but raise his eyebrows slightly.</p><p></p><p>This was quite different from what the manager had said, that the house he rented was only a hundred bucks a month, how did it become at least 800 in his mouth? "You better not be cheating me? My friend just rented a house, it's not as expensive as you said."</p><p></p><p>The customer manager still smiled and said, "No problem, I was just giving a rough price range, you can tell me your expected price, and I'll give you a reference."</p><p></p><p>"Hmm, I want a hundred-dollar house."</p><p></p><p>The smile on the customer manager's face suddenly disappeared.</p><p></p><p>"What did you say?"</p><p></p><p>"A hundred-dollar-a-month house!"</p><p></p><p>"Security, throw this idiot out!"</p><p></p><p>"A hundred-dollar rental, did your brain get water? Psycho, get out of here. If I see you again, I'll break your legs."</p><p></p><p>Thrown out by the security guards, Ning Yuthen felt deeply puzzled.</p><p></p><p>Why could the manager rent a house for a hundred bucks, but he couldn't? But after the frustration, he started to walk towards other agencies.</p><p></p><p>Maybe he could find one by asking around a few more places.</p><p></p><p>What he didn't notice was that in a corner of the street, a black mist was closely watching him.</p><p></p><p>"Hehe, I can't believe my luck, I actually found a descendant of the Silver Fox clan. As long as I enter his soul and activate his bloodline, I can attract the powerful experts of the Silver Fox clan. </p><p></p><p>I'll use this kid to blackmail the Silver Fox clan, and then, combined with the Seven Star Convergence, I'll have two preparations ready, and I'll definitely be able to break the seal and revive myself.</p><p></p><p>When that happens, that little brat who killed my clone, I'll definitely swallow him alive and make him my nourishment!"</p><p></p><p>Here is the full English translation of the Chinese excerpt:</p><p></p><p>On the other side, Ye Xiao returned home and saw the messy state of the house, with several large holes dug out of the sofa. He couldn't help but furrow his brows slightly.</p><p></p><p>From the traces, these were clearly caused by sharp claws.</p><p></p><p>Moreover, the aura in the room was very familiar - it was the aura of Huan Liuli, with no other life forms present.</p><p></p><p>This meant that all of this was done by Huan Liuli?</p><p></p><p>"This dead cat, is it really so itchy for trouble?"</p><p></p><p>The Taixuan Tiangong had just been activated, and Ye Xiao wanted to try to locate Huan Liuli. The next moment, an extremely fierce aura surged out from behind Ye Xiao, rushing towards his spine.</p><p></p><p>Ye Xiao's eyes narrowed slightly, activating the Shenyi Jue. His body instantly vanished from the original spot, reappearing behind the attacker.</p><p></p><p>Then, he unleashed the powerful strength of his innate fifth-grade cultivation, heavily stomping on the other's back and pinning them to the ground, no matter how they struggled, they were unable to get up.</p><p></p><p>"Let me go, meow! Meow!" </p><p></p><p>Beneath his foot, Huan Liuli kept struggling and roaring.</p><p></p><p>Ye Xiao raised his eyebrows slightly.</p><p></p><p>Something was off. Huan Liuli's usual behavior was not like this, and her pupils had already turned into the vertical pupils of a beast.</p><p></p><p>This was not her normal reaction.</p><p></p><p>Without further hesitation, the Taixuan Tiangong accelerated, and a massive amount of spiritual power frantically surged into Huan Liuli's mind, suppressing her spiritual power.</p><p></p><p>In an instant, Huan Liuli quieted down and gradually fell into a deep sleep.</p><p></p><p>"Ye Xiao, run quickly, don't come back these few days," she murmured in her sleep.</p><p></p><p>Ye Xiao's face turned grave as he carried her back to her room, letting her rest on the bed, then returned to his own room.</p><p></p><p>Just now, when his Taixuan Tiangong had briefly scanned her mind, he understood what was happening.</p><p></p><p>The Seven-Star Convergence was coming!</p><p></p><p>The so-called Seven-Star Convergence referred to the seven special stars in the sky forming a straight line. Because the power of the Beastly Spirits comes from the stars in the universe, the changes in the stars would have a huge impact on the Beastly Spirits.</p><p></p><p>The Seven-Star Convergence was the most significant of all these influences.</p><p></p><p>When the Seven-Star Convergence occurred, the power of the Beastly Spirits would almost double or even triple in growth. The closer one was to the stars, the higher the multiple of growth would be, but no one knew where the limit was.</p><p></p><p>However, the problem was that along with the growth in power, it would also bring a huge disaster - the Beastly Spirits would lose their sanity and gradually go mad.</p><p></p><p>Imagine the already terrifying Beastly Spirits, now with their powers greatly increased, yet completely losing their reason and recklessly attacking other life forms without regard for life or death. This would be a nightmare-like disaster! Even worse, the Seven-Star Convergence was something that even the Demihuman race could not withstand, and they might also lose their minds and attack humans like the Beastly Spirits.</p><p></p><p>This was why human society was so wary of the Demihuman race.</p><p></p><p>Furthermore, on the day of the Seven-Star Convergence, Beastly Spirits like Huan Liuli and Demihuman like Ning Yuheng would be unable to resist, their consciousness falling into madness. Not to mention the sealed Aer King, who knew if his power would not also increase, and his consciousness fall into insanity?</p><p></p><p>Ye Xiao rubbed his temples.</p><p></p><p>"It seems I'll have to read more books recently."</p><p></p><p>(End of chapter)</p>

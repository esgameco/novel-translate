        <h1>Chapter 6</h1>
        <div class="content">
            <p>Here is the full English translation of the Chinese excerpt:</p><p></p><p>"Your matter is not an illegal transaction, now it's her accusing you of fraud!"</p><p></p><p>In the noisy defense team, Ye Xiao found Gu Hai, bare-chested, with one shoe missing from his left foot, his eyes bloodshot, likely having not slept all night.</p><p></p><p>"You say you are his father?"</p><p></p><p>The defense team member responsible for handling Gu Hai, glanced at Ye Xiao, his expression somewhat conflicted.</p><p></p><p>Ye Xiao solemnly nodded his head.</p><p></p><p>"My son's education was lacking, I hope you can forgive him."</p><p></p><p>"No, I'm surnamed Lu, at least I'm part of the defense team, are you trying to treat me like an idiot? If you said you were his brother, I still wouldn't believe you, but you actually dare to say you're his father?"</p><p></p><p>Ye Xiao fell silent for a moment, and while the others weren't paying attention, he slipped a roll of red paper into the other's pocket. The other man coughed lightly, then spoke up:</p><p></p><p>"Cough cough, well, considering he's still young and this is his first offense, I'll just give him an oral warning. In the future, have your son keep himself clean and stay away from places he shouldn't go."</p><p></p><p>"Yes, thank you Mr. Lu."</p><p></p><p>"It's nothing, you can go."</p><p></p><p>Ye Xiao nodded, and led Gu Hai out of the defense team. Fortunately, the other had been pre-warned, and he got Gu Hai a set of clothes to change into.</p><p></p><p>Once he was properly dressed up, Gu Hai finally came back to life, the characteristic scoundrel's smile reappearing on his weary face.</p><p></p><p>"Old Ye, I owe this all to you. If you hadn't come to pretend to be my dad, I'd be done for."</p><p></p><p>"Don't mention it, I don't really want a son like you who can't behave. This time to save you, I spent a total of three thousand, plus fifty for the taxi, can you reimburse me?"</p><p></p><p>"Sure, my phone is out of battery, I'll charge it and pay you back once it's on."</p><p></p><p>Ye Xiao nodded, and the two walked out of the defense team hall. Just as they were leaving the door, Gu Hai bumped into a middle-aged man being escorted in.</p><p></p><p>"Sorry, sorry, I didn't mean to."</p><p></p><p>Gu Hai chuckled, but the other man just gave him a cold glance and was led away by the defense team member.</p><p></p><p>Gu Hai scratched his head, frowning.</p><p></p><p>"What a fierce gaze, I just bumped into him a little."</p><p></p><p>But Ye Xiao was thoughtfully watching that retreating figure.</p><p></p><p>After breaking through to the Grandmaster realm, his perception ability was naturally far beyond that of ordinary people.</p><p></p><p>Just now, he had clearly sensed a strange fluctuation from that middle-aged man. It was a non-human fluctuation, though it was also vigorous, with thick vital energy, it carried a trace of bloodthirsty killing intent! Although he had hidden it very well, the leakage was very weak, and no one around had sensed it, but Ye Xiao had perceived it clearly.</p><p></p><p>He just wasn't sure what kind of fluctuation it was.</p><p></p><p>"Old Ye, what's wrong? Why are you still looking at him?"</p><p></p><p>"Nothing, let's go back, it's almost time to clock in."</p><p></p><p>The two took a taxi and quickly returned to the library, just in time to clock in.</p><p></p><p>However, today, surprisingly, the librarian had actually called a general meeting, notifying all staff that they must act low-key recently, and not to vent their anger on any martial artists who enter the library, or they would face serious punishment!</p><p></p><p>Her speech was light in speed, but the words were heavily emphasized, making it clear she was not joking.</p><p></p><p>Ye Xiao didn't really care, as very few martial artists came to his third-floor area, and even if there were, with his gentle temperament, he wouldn't offend anyone.</p><p></p><p>The librarian was an old white-haired woman, and Ye Xiao had seen her from afar a few times before, thinking she looked ruddy and vigorous.</p><p></p><p>But now, after his cultivation had broken through to the Grandmaster realm, he suddenly realized that...</p><p></p><p>Here is the full English translation of the Chinese excerpt:</p><p></p><p>Long Juran was actually a powerful master. But this didn't surprise him too much, as the library was the foundation of a city, and the librarian would need sufficient strength to guard it.</p><p></p><p>The librarian seemed to have noticed his gaze, and swept a glance in his direction, with a hint of surprise in her eyes.</p><p></p><p>'How come this young man's aura has suddenly become so impressive?' </p><p></p><p>She couldn't help but be astonished in her heart.</p><p></p><p>As the librarian, she naturally knew that Ye Xiao was a handsome employee in the library, and was even called the "library grass" by his colleagues. But before, Ye Xiao was only good-looking, while today, his aura was exceptionally outstanding.</p><p></p><p>However, after a brief look, she didn't find anything unusual, so she stopped looking and continued the meeting.</p><p></p><p>Ye Xiao raised his eyebrows slightly.</p><p></p><p>This librarian, being a powerful master, actually noticed his unusual change.</p><p></p><p>Unfortunately, after becoming a master, one can conceal their aura. </p><p></p><p>The librarian hadn't fully concealed her aura, so he was able to detect her. But he had completely concealed his own aura, so she couldn't see through him.</p><p></p><p>Previously, he had been able to avoid the librarian's notice by keeping a low profile.</p><p></p><p>It seems he'll have to be even more low-key going forward.</p><p></p><p>After the meeting ended, Ye Xiao started to walk upstairs, and Gu Hai came up to him, hooking his shoulder and speaking:</p><p></p><p>"Old Ye, do you know why the librarian suddenly asked us to keep a low profile?"</p><p></p><p>Ye Xiao shook his head.</p><p></p><p>Gu Hai said solemnly, "I just heard from Wang Jie on the first floor that a new master has appeared in our Jianghai City! He slashed a blade by the river, over 800 meters! Almost a kilometer! Now many forums are in an uproar about it."</p><p></p><p>Ye Xiao's eyelids flickered, but his face remained calm as he said, "It's not necessarily a new master, right? Jianghai City already has powerful master experts, maybe it was an attack by an old master?"</p><p></p><p>"Absolutely impossible! Whenever a master appears, they are usually absorbed into the army or major mercenary companies to fight the star beasts on the frontlines. Our Jianghai City currently only has three resident masters - our librarian Ouyang Yunzhong, the dean of the Martial Arts Academy Qin Shenglong, and the so-called once-in-a-century genius of Jianghai City, Nangong Ling! </p><p></p><p>The three of them are not sword users, although they are masters, they can't produce such a long blade mark!"</p><p></p><p>"Oh!"</p><p></p><p>"That's all you have to say? 'Oh'? Aren't you excited that a new master has appeared in our Jianghai City? Don't you admire them?"</p><p></p><p>"Masters don't give me food to eat. If you could just pay me back the money you owe, I'd be much happier."</p><p></p><p>"Uh..."</p><p></p><p>Gu Hai rubbed his nose, looking a bit embarrassed.</p><p></p><p>"Alright, I'll go recharge my funds and immediately transfer the money to you."</p><p></p><p>With that, the two of them arrived on the second floor, and Gu Hai quickly ran off to his management area, while Ye Xiao continued up to the third floor.</p><p></p><p>He didn't reveal his own situation to Gu Hai - friends are friends, but secrets are still secrets.</p><p></p><p>Moreover, today's events have made the originally more easygoing Ye Xiao feel a slight sense of crisis.</p><p></p><p>Even if you stay low-key and inconspicuous, occasional inadvertent exposure can still potentially bring danger.</p><p></p><p>In short, he's still not strong enough. So he needs to put in a bit more effort.</p><p></p><p>First, he'll set a small goal - to break through to the late Innate Realm and become a Divine Ancestor within a year.</p><p></p><p>(This chapter ends)</p>

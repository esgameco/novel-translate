        <div class="content">
            <p>Here is the full English translation of the Chinese excerpt:</p><p></p><p>After a pause, Uncle Ning spoke again:</p><p></p><p>"However, to get back to the point, I've also brought you a command from your father this time."</p><p></p><p>Ning Zhiyuan was startled, and his expression became serious. "Uncle, please go on."</p><p></p><p>"From today onwards, all the people and resources here are yours to use, and they are the only resources you are allowed to utilize. Aside from these people and resources, you are not permitted to touch anyone else from the Ning family.</p><p></p><p>Unless your enemies also employ experts above the Slay God Realm!"</p><p></p><p>"Does Father's intention mean he wants to test me?" </p><p></p><p>Ning Zhiyuan was somewhat puzzled, and Uncle Ning solemnly nodded.</p><p></p><p>"That's correct. A Deity King's Tomb is indeed a considerable resource for our Ning family, but more important than the legacy left behind by a deceased Deity King is the cultivation of the Ning family's future heir.</p><p></p><p>Cultivating the Ning family's heir well has the potential to produce a new Deity King in the future. </p><p></p><p>A living Deity King! Your father's idea is to give you this trial, to see how you handle it successfully in the end.</p><p></p><p>Unless it reaches the point where the Ning family must intervene, he will not provide you with any other assistance."</p><p></p><p>Ning Zhiyuan's expression became grave, and he nodded.</p><p></p><p>He understood his father's good intentions.</p><p></p><p>The resources in this world are ultimately limited, and it's impossible to perfectly take care of everyone.</p><p></p><p>Although the Ning family's resources are powerful, they are not endless.</p><p></p><p>Otherwise, the Ning family would not have only three Deity Kings and no Deity Emperor-level experts.</p><p></p><p>The Ning family, as well as other clans, will have a systematic allocation of resources for their disciples. </p><p></p><p>Only the most dazzling new star has the qualifications to become the mightiest ruler! Apart from that, the rest can only be supporting cast.</p><p></p><p>In the past, his father was able to be cultivated by the Ning family because of his outstanding performance, becoming the best of his generation.</p><p></p><p>Similarly, his brothers and sisters, that is, Ning Zhiyuan's uncles and aunts, are currently only at the peak of the Deity Realm and below, while he has already broken through to above the Slay God Realm.</p><p></p><p>And he is only over 60 years old this year.</p><p></p><p>This is the result of a major clan's focused cultivation.</p><p></p><p>The speed of progress is shockingly terrifying!</p><p></p><p>After all, in the martial dao, the younger one is, the higher the realm they can cultivate to, and the higher their future potential.</p><p></p><p>His father may very well break through to the Deity King Realm in the future.</p><p></p><p>And now, although Ning Zhiyuan is the young master of the Ning family, if someone surpasses him, the Ning family's resources may become unbalanced.</p><p></p><p>If he can also demonstrate his extraordinary talent, he will be able to obtain more stable and abundant resources, and have the opportunity to become like his father in the future.</p><p></p><p>"Uncle, although we have annihilated the invading Three Divine Tribes this time, the Three Divine Tribes have not been damaged at their roots.</p><p></p><p>And if I guess correctly, the people of the Three Divine Tribes must have notified their respective divine tribes."</p><p></p><p>Uncle Ning pondered for a moment.</p><p></p><p>"Regarding this, you don't need to worry too much.</p><p></p><p>I will protect you here, and at the same time set up more powerful defensive formations and teleportation arrays to establish a base.</p><p></p><p>In this way, if the other side dares to invade, they won't be able to break through the defensive formations for a while.</p><p></p><p>And by the time they can break through the defensive formations, our Ning family's experts will probably have arrived.</p><p></p><p>Among the Three Divine Tribes, only the Thunder God Tribe has a Deity King expert, and he is already in his twilight years, so he dares not act rashly.</p><p></p><p>The remaining small fry are not a threat."</p><p></p><p>Ning Zhiyuan shook his head.</p><p></p><p>"Uncle, your view is too one-sided.</p><p></p><p>Although the Three Divine Tribes will certainly be wary of the Ning family behind us, they have suffered such a heavy loss, and they definitely won't give up so easily.</p><p></p><p>If I guess correctly, in order to vent their anger, they are very likely to spread the news that there are many divine tombs here everywhere.</p><p></p><p>When that happens, we won't know how many experts will come to covet this place. That's when the real trouble will start."</p><p></p><p>Uncle Ning nodded.</p><p></p><p>"The fact that you can think of this is already remarkable. So what are you planning to do next?"</p><p></p><p>The Ning family can deal with the Three Divine Tribes, but they may not necessarily be able to handle thirty divine tribes or three hundred divine tribes.</p><p></p><p>There are so many divine tombs here, which is equivalent to a large batch of cultivation resources.</p><p></p><p>There may even be the possibility of a Deity King's Tomb that countless people will go crazy over.</p><p></p><p>In the starry sky, it will undoubtedly attract the coveting of countless people.</p><p></p><p>Uncle Ning really wanted to know what Ning Zhiyuan had in mind.</p><p></p><p>Ning Zhiyuan took a deep breath, and a hint of craziness flashed in his eyes.</p><p></p><p>"I will notify the major families under the Xuanyuan Divine Clan lineage, and invite them to come treasure hunting in the name of the Ning family's young master."</p><p></p><p>Uncle Ning's pupils shrank.</p><p></p><p>"Your idea is a bit too crazy."</p><p></p><p>"Not at all crazy.</p><p></p><p>Although we know there is a Deity King's Tomb here, it hasn't appeared yet.</p><p></p><p>Even if we get the entire Ning family to come, we can't guarantee that we'll find the Deity King's Tomb before the Three Divine Tribes spread the news.</p><p></p><p>If we can't find the Deity King's Tomb in time, and other divine tribes have already spread the news, it will be just as troublesome.</p><p></p><p>Here is the full English translation of the Chinese excerpt:</p><p></p><p>It will attract a lot of people to compete for it.</p><p></p><p>The chance for the Ning family to obtain this divine king's tomb is almost impossible, at 100%.</p><p></p><p>Moreover, at that time, they may also face the pressure of various forces, as well as the resentment of the various major families of the Xuanyuan clan.</p><p></p><p>On the contrary, I, as the young master of the Ning family, will invite the young masters of the major families to explore the divine king's tomb. Firstly, it will make them owe me a favor. Secondly, when they come, the families behind them will also be pulled onto my boat. In the future, if too many divine clan members come, the Ning family will not have to fight alone, facing enemies from all sides.</p><p></p><p>"A good strategy!"</p><p></p><p>At this moment, Ning Second Uncle couldn't help but praise Ning Zhiyuan's idea with admiration.</p><p></p><p>Knowing that he is very likely unable to obtain the entire divine king's tomb, he decisively makes a bold move, exchanging the loss of a part of the uncertain resources for the support of many allies. This mentality and intelligence, at Ning Zhiyuan's age, are indeed worthy of praise.</p><p></p><p>At this moment, Ning Second Uncle seemed to see a new rising star of the Ning family, constantly emitting its own brilliance.</p><p></p><p>"Just do as you plan, I will fully support you."</p><p></p><p>Ning Zhiyuan nodded, and then spoke again:</p><p></p><p>"Oh, there's one more thing, I need to ask Second Uncle for help."</p><p></p><p>"Tell me."</p><p></p><p>"Among the experts from the Three Divine Clans who came this time, there is a cultivator at the fourth level of the Divine Realm, who fled during the battle.</p><p></p><p>I hope that Second Uncle can help me investigate this.</p><p></p><p>He is a descendant of our Xuanyuan clan, and I'm afraid their safety may be threatened."</p><p></p><p>Ning Second Uncle nodded.</p><p></p><p>"I'll take care of this matter. You can focus on your own affairs."</p><p></p><p>"Then I'll leave it to Second Uncle."</p><p></p><p>"You silly boy, why be so polite with me? Alright, I'll go now. He shouldn't have gone too far, let me go and patrol to see if I can find him."</p><p></p><p>In Jianghai City, Ye Xiao finished a day's work and returned home, continuing to cut the meat of the big fish.</p><p></p><p>Since there was no meat of other star beasts, and he wanted to quickly improve his own strength, he had to cut more meat from this big fish star beast.</p><p></p><p>Even if he gets tired of it, there's no other choice, just like a man, no matter how much he does it, he can take a pill and still have to force himself to do it.</p><p></p><p>Otherwise, he'll just become a waste.</p><p></p><p>Finally, after repeatedly plucking the wool like this, Ye Xiao hasn't reached the point of feeling sick from the taste, but the big fish can't bear it anymore!</p><p></p><p>"Have you had enough? Day after day, can't you have some self-respect? Plucking wool is not supposed to be done like this, can't you find another star beast?"</p><p></p><p>Since I was captured by you, tell me, have you let me rest for a single day?</p><p></p><p>Morning and night. In the human world, there are seven days a week, but you want to do it to me eight days.</p><p></p><p>I say, you eat my meat every day, haven't you gotten tired of it?"</p><p></p><p>He shouted without any politeness, because he had already seen through it, even if he cursed Ye Xiao's whole family, Ye Xiao wouldn't kill him, and even if he killed him, he would just revive him again.</p><p></p><p>He had completely lost all hope for himself.</p><p></p><p>Ye Xiao paused for a moment.</p><p></p><p>"Indeed, I'm tired of it."</p><p></p><p>Then he gave the big fish another slash.</p><p></p><p>The big fish was exasperated.</p><p></p><p>"Aren't you a man? The only thing you should be thinking about is women! Can't you go find a girlfriend? Spend every day figuring out how to make her happy, have her sing songs for you, the kind of songs that are all in the same tone.</p><p></p><p>Wouldn't that be a hundred times better than staring at me, this one fish, every day?"</p><p></p><p>As soon as he finished speaking, Ye Xiao gave him another slash.</p><p></p><p>"Fuck!"</p><p></p><p>The big fish was really in despair now. Nowadays, Ye Xiao, for the sake of convenience, directly comes in after work, with soy sauce and mustard sauce, and then cuts meat from this fish, calling it "fresh".</p><p></p><p>Ye Xiao is fresh, but he is the one suffering.</p><p></p><p>"Stop, don't attack me for now. I'll tell you a piece of news that can change your life."</p><p></p><p>Ye Xiao raised his eyebrows slightly.</p><p></p><p>"What news do you have to tell me?"</p><p></p><p>The big fish took a deep breath, his face solemn:</p><p></p><p>"Have you heard of the Divine King's Tomb?"</p><p></p><p>Ye Xiao's gaze suddenly became focused.</p><p></p><p>"You know about the Divine King's Tomb?"</p><p></p><p>"Of course I do!" </p><p></p><p>A look of pride flashed across the big fish's face.</p><p></p><p>"As long as you let me go, I can take you there right away, how about it?"</p><p></p><p>However, the response he received was another slash from Ye Xiao.</p><p></p><p>The big fish: "(_..)!"</p><p></p><p>"I've already told you about the Divine King's Tomb, why are you still cutting me?"</p><p></p><p>"I'm used to it, just continue."</p><p></p><p>The big fish was so angry that he wanted to vomit blood, but he didn't dare to resist, so he could only speak:</p><p></p><p>"The location of that Divine King's Tomb is in the place where I used to reside, there is a spatial entrance there, which is the direct entrance to the Divine King's Tomb."</p><p></p><p>Ye Xiao nodded and began to ponder.</p><p></p><p>The divine national treasury he is currently excavating is taking too long, and he can't get the resources inside in the short term. So, while waiting, going to dig up a Divine King's Tomb seems quite good as well.</p>

        <h1>Chapter 184</h1>
        <div class="content">
            <p>Here is the full English translation of the Chinese excerpt:</p><p></p><p>In addition to the original Tang Dao, there were also blood-red sand, ten-thousand-year meteorite, ten-thousand-year cold iron, diamond, and blood-red jade.</p><p></p><p>A large batch of rare materials were all taken out by Ye Xiao.</p><p></p><p>He then began to refine the essence from them.</p><p></p><p>The powerful divine craftsmanship was activated, and it was very easy to extract the essence from all the rare materials and gradually infuse them into the Tang Dao according to a certain proportion.</p><p></p><p>As the essence of these materials was infused, the surface of the Tang Dao began to turn red and hot.</p><p></p><p>Moreover, its length also seemed to be slowly increasing, becoming longer and larger! Originally, its length was only about six feet, but now it gradually increased to seven feet.</p><p></p><p>Ye Xiao could feel how strong the rigidity of the Tang Dao was, and how powerful the spiritual energy it could be imbued with! The strength of a weapon lies in how much spiritual energy it can withstand and support.</p><p></p><p>The main function of a weapon is to amplify. The more spiritual energy it is imbued with, the stronger its amplification effect will be.</p><p></p><p>After this tempering by Ye Xiao, he felt that the Tang Dao's overall capabilities had increased by at least five times compared to before.</p><p></p><p>Originally, Ye Xiao needed a certain amount of time to fully imbue the Tang Dao with spiritual energy, but now the time required would be even longer.</p><p></p><p>If he could successfully complete the full infusion, it would be equivalent to Ye Xiao's own cultivation level increasing significantly, surpassing the Innate Ninth Realm, without a doubt.</p><p></p><p>Of course, when experts fight, the opponent would not give him the opportunity to imbue the weapon with spiritual energy for such a long time.</p><p></p><p>However, this still represented a huge improvement for Ye Xiao, because the amplification power of the Tang Dao would also become stronger. It's like the difference between heating a bucket of water to 50 degrees versus 100 degrees - the destructive power is vastly different.</p><p></p><p>Another point is that although Ye Xiao cannot immediately fully imbue the Tang Dao with spiritual energy right now, as his cultivation continues to rise, reaching the Innate Ninth Realm, or even the rumored King Realm and Emperor Realm, he will definitely be able to do so.</p><p></p><p>At that time, the amplification power of the Tang Dao will continue to be magnified along with Ye Xiao's cultivation.</p><p></p><p>Soon, the materials had fully fused, which was the current limit of what the Tang Dao could integrate. If he wanted to further improve it, he would need to find even better and higher-grade materials.</p><p></p><p>This was the time to put the Dragon Soul inside as well.</p><p></p><p>Ye Xiao took out the iron box containing the Dragon Soul and the Dragon Soul Master's essence blood.</p><p></p><p>He first released the essence blood and then absorbed it into the Tang Dao.</p><p></p><p>"Sizzle—! Rumble—!"</p><p></p><p>As soon as Ye Xiao did this, a layer of dark clouds began to shroud the sky above.</p><p></p><p>Ye Xiao's eyes narrowed slightly.</p><p></p><p>As expected, it had come.</p><p></p><p>He guessed correctly that when a cultivator's cultivation reached a certain level, or when a weapon or elixir exceeded the mundane realm, the heavens would descend a tribulation lightning.</p><p></p><p>There might be a triggering mechanism in the current space, and when something surpassed this mechanism, it would trigger the lightning. If it did not exceed this mechanism, the lightning would not be triggered.</p><p></p><p>However, since he had already decided to do this, he would not stop.</p><p></p><p>After taking a deep breath, Ye Xiao decisively opened the box containing the Dragon Soul.</p><p></p><p>Rumble.</p><p></p><p>As soon as the box was opened, a violent explosion immediately echoed from the sky above, and a lightning bolt as thick as a bucket came crashing down towards Ye Xiao's head.</p><p></p><p>The divine spirit of the dragon was originally supposed to dissipate into the heavens and earth, but now Ye Xiao was preparing to fuse it into a weapon. This meant not only giving it the opportunity to continue existing in this world, but also allowing it to live for a very long time.</p><p></p><p>This act seemed to have triggered some unseen rules in the cosmic order.</p><p></p><p>The powerful lightning, infused with supreme heavenly might, made the Dragon Soul, despite being an extremely powerful divine spirit, shudder involuntarily.</p><p></p><p>In the face of heavenly might, any powerful being appears so insignificant.</p><p></p><p>But in the end, it was blocked by Ye Xiao's protective spiritual energy.</p><p></p><p>Ye Xiao knew, however, that this was just the first warning, and there would be countless more until he could complete the forging of the weapon.</p><p></p><p>"Dragon Soul, why haven't you entered the blade yet?"</p><p></p><p>A stern shout awakened the Dragon Soul, and it immediately transformed into a golden light and rushed into the Tang Dao.</p><p></p><p>At this moment, the thunderclouds in the sky seemed to be completely enraged.</p><p></p><p>One powerful lightning bolt after another, far thicker than the previous one, came crashing down, accompanied by earth-shattering roars, transforming into lightning dragons that reached towards Ye Xiao's head.</p><p></p><p>Boom, boom, boom...</p><p></p><p>The massive and concentrated lightning energy directly knocked Ye Xiao's body dozens of meters away in an instant.</p><p></p><p>Ye Xiao's heart sank, and he exerted all his strength to activate the Indestructible Divine Skill, while frantically channeling his spiritual energy into the Black Scale Armor to defend against the lightning energy.</p><p></p><p>The Tang Dao was also being baptized by the lightning, and the Dragon Soul inside seemed to be frightened, constantly moving around in the internal space of the blade, trying to evade.</p><p></p><p>Ye Xiao's face turned cold.</p><p></p><p>"Are you a waste? This is your only chance to survive. Either fight against the heavens, or perish and turn to ashes. I'm here being struck by lightning with you, and I'm not afraid, so what are you afraid of?"</p><p></p><p>Hearing these words, the Dragon Soul trembled. That's right, it's either live or die! </p><p></p><p>Alone by itself...</p><p></p><p>Here is the full English translation of the Chinese excerpt:</p><p></p><p>After being sealed by the Beast God Alliance for so many years, it still did not die.</p><p></p><p>Now, with a master by its side to fight alongside it, if it did not seize this opportunity, wouldn't it truly be a waste? "Roar!"</p><p></p><p>It let out a roar, forcibly enduring the lightning's damage to its soul body, moving within the Tang Dao, allowing its soul body and the Tang Dao to fuse into one, forming a divine weapon that surpassed even the Imperial Weapons!</p><p></p><p>At this moment, the lightning had instead become a tool to temper it. Every strike caused its soul body and the Tang Dao's physical form to fuse even more tightly.</p><p></p><p>Soon, dragon scale engravings appeared on the blade, each one containing the patterns of lightning, appearing mysterious and extraordinary, exuding an immense awe-inspiring power.</p><p></p><p>One second! Two seconds!</p><p></p><p>Three seconds!</p><p></p><p>The surrounding mountains were sliced off by the lightning, several meters high, in this extreme environment, the Tang Dao finally completed its evolution.</p><p></p><p>After seventy-nine seconds of continuous strikes, a thunderous roar erupted, soaring into the sky.</p><p></p><p>The previous dragon roars were intangible, only those who had cultivated spiritual power could perceive them.</p><p></p><p>But this dragon roar was a real, tangible one.</p><p></p><p>At this moment, Ye Xiao's Tang Dao had finally evolved into a divine weapon that surpassed even the Imperial Weapons!</p><p></p><p>It not only had its own consciousness, but it could also fight on its own without Ye Xiao.</p><p></p><p>And with Ye Xiao's spiritual energy supporting it, its destructive power would be multiplied several times.</p><p></p><p>Under the heavens, in the realm of weapons, it would have few rivals.</p><p></p><p>The entire Jianghai City, including the nearby cities, were shrouded by the ominous lightning clouds.</p><p></p><p>Many citizens were puzzled by this strange sight.</p><p></p><p>"How strange, why are there such huge thunderclouds? The weather forecast said there would be no rain today!"</p><p></p><p>"I'd better hurry home to bring in the laundry. My little darling has just been washed, I can't have it get wet."</p><p></p><p>Some powerful experts had already noticed the direction of the lightning.</p><p></p><p>They were all pointing towards the mountains between the cities. The oppressive and awe-inspiring power made their hearts race, their blood boiling.</p><p></p><p>"Is someone breaking through?"</p><p></p><p>"Just like last time, it has actually provoked the Heavenly Might."</p><p></p><p>"Could it be Senior Sword Immortal?"</p><p></p><p>Liu Chengxun, who was guiding his disciple Pao Jiansheng in cultivation on this Saturday, suddenly had a grave expression upon seeing the thunderclouds.</p><p></p><p>"Master, this thundercloud is not ordinary!"</p><p></p><p>Liu Chengxun nodded, his eyes gleaming with intensity.</p><p></p><p>"This is not a normal thundercloud, but a Tribulation. When one's cultivation is too strong and they must undergo Tribulation, or when an extremely powerful existence emerges, it will summon such a Tribulation.</p><p></p><p>That is a power we have never witnessed before."</p><p></p><p>"Could it be Sword Immortal?"</p><p></p><p>"Possibly! I'll go take a look, you don't follow, your cultivation is not enough to withstand this lightning, one strike and you'll be severely injured!"</p><p></p><p>With that, he instantly transformed into a beam of light, rushing towards the mountains.</p><p></p><p>At this moment, the thunderclouds were continuously gathering around Ye Xiao, as if wanting to give him a thorough lesson, allowing him to truly learn his lesson.</p><p></p><p>Ye Xiao gently caressed the long sword, and it emanated a warm temperature, the dragon soul responding to him.</p><p></p><p>Ye Xiao smiled slightly, flicking a drop of his essence blood from his fingertip, letting it sink into the blade's edge.</p><p></p><p>"We are both unfortunate ones, but now that we have the chance to live again, it is an opportunity as well as a challenge.</p><p></p><p>Although I'm usually quite carefree, when faced with a real situation, I don't like to just passively wait.</p><p></p><p>This Tang Dao has never been named since its forging, so today I shall name it based on your dragon attributes."</p><p></p><p>The Tang Dao emitted a soft dragon soul's hum, the dragon soul excited, anticipating Ye Xiao's naming.</p><p></p><p>"Dragons can be great or small, can appear or hide. Great, they can soar and exhale mist, small, they can conceal their form and hide in the waves, ascending and flying through the universe.</p><p></p><p>Let's call you... hmm, hmm..."</p><p></p><p>Damn it, Ye Xiao suddenly realized he was terrible at naming things!</p><p></p><p>Although he had memorized the Three Hundred Tang Poems, when it came to naming, his mind went completely blank.</p><p></p><p>This was a disaster.</p><p></p><p>The dragon soul let out another soft hum, as if puzzled by Ye Xiao's silence.</p><p></p><p>Ye Xiao fell silent for a moment, and the thunderous lightning in the sky was continuously accumulating, becoming more and more intense. This couldn't go on.</p><p></p><p>Alright, taking a deep breath, Ye Xiao spoke:</p><p></p><p>"From today onwards, your name shall be Great Dragon!"</p><p></p><p>The dragon soul suddenly let out a violent and excited roar. As a spiritual being, although it was extremely powerful, it lacked any real culture, as its previous master was just a child who had not yet gone to school, so it did not know whether this name was good or bad.</p><p></p><p>But as long as it was given by its master, it must be good!</p><p></p><p>Sensing the dragon soul's excitement, Ye Xiao exhaled a turbid breath, then looked at the vast thunderclouds, a sharp glint flashing in his eyes.</p><p></p><p>"Are you addicted to striking?"</p><p></p><p>Three updates, nine thousand words.</p><p></p><p>Seeking recommendations, monthly votes, and subscriptions.</p><p></p><p>(This chapter ends)</p>

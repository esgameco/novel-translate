        <h1>Chapter 341</h1>
        <div class="content">
            <p>Here is the full English translation of the Chinese excerpt:</p><p></p><p>However, Ye Xiao was also clear in his heart that he could not be arrogant because of this, and he still needed to be more cautious.</p><p></p><p>First, although his current strength has already become very powerful after his breakthrough, he has not yet reached the Divine Realm, and even if he does break through to the Divine Realm, there are still stronger existences above him.</p><p></p><p>Secondly, the main reason why he was able to break through so quickly was that several forces had set up more powerful spiritual gathering formations across the Nine Provinces.</p><p></p><p>This reason cannot be ignored, because in the past, Emperor Jing and Emperor Yun spent several hundred years cultivating, and they could only cultivate a few dragon auras. Now, Emperor Jing was able to cultivate another dragon aura in just two years, all thanks to the spiritual gathering formations.</p><p></p><p>The spiritual gathering formations have increased the speed of spiritual energy absorption in the Nine Provinces by nearly a hundredfold, allowing countless low-level martial artists to greatly improve their cultivation, and also benefiting the Emperor Realm experts.</p><p></p><p>If it was the previous speed of spiritual energy absorption in the Nine Provinces, Ye Xiao definitely would not have improved so quickly.</p><p></p><p>And within these past few years, Ye Xiao's cultivation techniques have also made great progress.</p><p></p><p>His previous leg technique had already been successfully integrated two years ago after defeating Lin Qingbei, and he obtained the Divine Technique level leg technique - Exterminating Starry Sky!</p><p></p><p>Within two years, Ye Xiao had successively integrated the Divine Technique level sword technique - Burying God Sword, the Divine Technique level forging technique - Forging God Technique, the Divine Technique level finger technique - Sacrificing Heaven Finger, and the Divine Technique level claw technique - Severing Starry River.</p><p></p><p>In other words, except for the Mandate Technique, Ocular Technique, Pill Refining Technique, and Formation Technique, all of Ye Xiao's other cultivation techniques have already been upgraded to the Divine Technique level!</p><p></p><p>And Ye Xiao also discovered that he could continue to extract Divine Techniques from Emperor Techniques.</p><p></p><p>Furthermore, with the addition of many Emperor Techniques in the library due to the establishment of the Divine Wood Academy, he could continue to refine his techniques and complete the fusion of Divine Techniques.</p><p></p><p>The library is truly amazing!</p><p></p><p>That day, Ye Xiao went to the library as usual.</p><p></p><p>At the entrance, he encountered Liu Chengxun.</p><p></p><p>Half a year ago, Liu Chengxun had finally passed the exam and become a student of the elite class, the fourth batch of students, and was now studying at the Divine Wood Academy's branch in Jianghai City.</p><p></p><p>It is said that the elite classes in other regions are also very difficult to get into, with only one session every half a year, and each time, less than twenty people are recruited, with an average of just a few people per class.</p><p></p><p>Moreover, the admission to the elite class is not determined by cultivation level, but by talent.</p><p></p><p>So, countless people have been striving to get in.</p><p></p><p>"Ye Xiao, long time no see."</p><p></p><p>Liu Chengxun saw him from afar and greeted him.</p><p></p><p>Ye Xiao waved his hand in response.</p><p></p><p>"Aren't you supposed to be in class today? Why do you have time to come here?"</p><p></p><p>Liu Chengxun explained:</p><p></p><p>"These two days, the XuanYuan Clan and the other three clans have had some friction, and the seniors responsible for guiding the elite class have gone to discuss countermeasures, so we have been given a half-day off."</p><p></p><p>Ye Xiao raised his eyebrows slightly.</p><p></p><p>He had already heard about the friction between the XuanYuan Clan and the other three clans.</p><p></p><p>All this enmity was rooted in what Lin Qingbei had done before.</p><p></p><p>Lin Qingbei had devoured all the divine blood of the Western Tribes, and in the end, all this divine blood fell into his own body.</p><p></p><p>The other three clans currently only know that Lin Qingbei, carrying the divine blood, had perished within the boundaries of the Nine Provinces, and it was in their hands.</p><p></p><p>But they don't know who he is, so they have no way to trace it.</p><p></p><p>However, no matter how untraceable it is, they still want to retrieve that divine blood.</p><p></p><p>So much divine blood has fallen into the hands of the XuanYuan Clan, they must be very unwilling to accept this.</p><p></p><p>This is also why the Western and Southern Tribes have basically been exterminated, but the three clans behind them have not left and have been waiting in the human world, probably just to reap some benefits.</p><p></p><p>Ye Xiao couldn't be bothered with these matters.</p><p></p><p>The divine blood he obtained back then was all through his own efforts.</p><p></p><p>Why should he return it? If they want to find it, they should go find Lin Qingbei, find the young master behind Lin Qingbei, he didn't directly snatch it from them.</p><p></p><p>"Anyway, how have you been doing recently?"</p><p></p><p>"Pretty good, my cultivation has reached the peak of the Xiantian Ninth Grade, just one step away from breaking through to the King Realm.</p><p></p><p>My old friends have also been doing very well.</p><p></p><p>My previous disciple, Pu Jiansheng, is now a Grand Master and is preparing to take the elite class exam.</p><p></p><p>And Fa Zheng, he has just broken through to the Xiantian Seventh Grade, the Divine Sect Realm. He is also preparing to take the elite class exam.</p><p></p><p>Other friends have also improved to varying degrees, especially your friend Qin Yuyan. She has also reached the Xiantian Seventh Grade Divine Sect Realm, and has just been admitted to the elite class. After I graduate this session, she will be taking over."</p><p></p><p>Ye Xiao nodded.</p><p></p><p>The progress of everyone is generally quite good.</p><p></p><p>Of course, compared to himself, there is still a huge gap.</p><p></p><p>The One Hundred and Eight Dragons of the Emperor Realm, although it is not exaggerated to the point where each dragon requires the cultivation of an Emperor Realm One Dragon, it is still much more difficult than cultivating the King Realm.</p><p></p><p>Ye Xiao has already surpassed the distance between the King Realm and the Emperor Realm by eighty or ninety, while their strength is still within the Xiantian Realm.</p><p></p><p>He really doesn't know if in the future, after hundreds or thousands of years, his strength will become too powerful, and he will live too long.</p><p></p><p>Here is the full English translation of the Chinese excerpt:</p><p></p><p>Then he watched helplessly as one by one, they grew old and fell by his side.</p><p></p><p>"Ye Xiao, are you really sure you don't want to go learn a bit? I know your cultivation talent is truly monstrous, but in the face of the experience of the Divine Clan, you should still learn more.</p><p></p><p>In these two years, you've only condensed a few protective dragon qi, right? It shouldn't have exceeded thirty yet? Closed-door cultivation is still not enough.</p><p></p><p>The Divine Clan has rich experience, which can definitely allow your cultivation to achieve twice the result with half the effort."</p><p></p><p>Ye Xiao: "(_..)! Well, let's not discourage me anymore. Let's just say I've only cultivated twenty or thirty dragon qi."</p><p></p><p>Liu Chengxun nodded.</p><p></p><p>"Keep it up, you can definitely do it. As long as you cultivate well, in a few decades, do you think you have a chance to break through the legendary Divine Realm?"</p><p></p><p>"Mm! Let's go, let's go read some books."</p><p></p><p>"Okay!"</p><p></p><p>The two walked into the library, and Ye Xiao began to search for imperial arts.</p><p></p><p>The area he managed had quite a few imperial arts, all issued by the Divine Wood Academy.</p><p></p><p>Ye Xiao was extracting fragments of divine arts from the imperial art cultivations, and then fusing them together.</p><p></p><p>Liu Chengxun also began to look for the books he needed.</p><p></p><p>At the same time, in the central state of Zhongzhou, the Empyrean experts of the major forces of the Xuanyuan Divine Clan had gathered in a conference room.</p><p></p><p>The atmosphere was quite solemn.</p><p></p><p>"Currently, the forces of the Winged Divine Clan, the Giant Ape Divine Clan, and the Thunder Divine Clan are pressing us harder and harder, demanding that we hand over the divine blood of their previous descendants.</p><p></p><p>Regarding this, does anyone have any thoughts?"</p><p></p><p>"What else can we think about? It's just a battle, that's all."</p><p></p><p>"That's right, they are just three divine clans ranked at the bottom, not worth mentioning at all. We, the Xuanyuan Divine Clan, are ranked 19th among the entire cosmic tribes, if we bow down to those three clans, it would make others laugh their heads off."</p><p></p><p>"As for their divine blood, not only do we not have it in our hands, even if we did, we absolutely cannot return it to them."</p><p></p><p>The Empyrean expert who spoke nodded.</p><p></p><p>"Well said, I also think so. They three clans may not dare to attack us. But this place is very far from the Xuanyuan Divine Clan, and there are no Divine Realm experts guarding it for now, so we can't say they won't make a move.</p><p></p><p>So, I hope that each of our five forces will dispatch a certain number of Empyrean experts! Stationed in the Nine States to guard against them from harming our descendants.</p><p></p><p>Our Divine Tiger Gate has the most Empyrean experts this time, so we'll take the lead and send out fifteen Empyrean experts!"</p><p></p><p>"No problem. We Burial Dragon Fortress will send out twelve Empyrean experts."</p><p></p><p>"Our Blazing Fire Gate will also send out twelve Empyrean experts."</p><p></p><p>"Lingming Sect will send out twelve as well."</p><p></p><p>"Divine Wood Academy will do the same as you."</p><p></p><p>"Good! In that case, I hope everyone can dispatch their Empyrean experts to gather and station in the Nine States by dusk tomorrow, to guard against the three clans."</p><p></p><p>"However, there is one thing I think we should prepare for in advance.</p><p></p><p>As the saying goes, a cornered rabbit will even bite a person. In case they get anxious and summon their own Divine Realm experts, what should we do? So I suggest that we several forces should immediately summon Divine Realm experts to come and guard the Nine States, to prevent any accidents."</p><p></p><p>The Empyrean expert from the Divine Tiger Gate nodded.</p><p></p><p>"The Nine States is a treasure trove that we have just discovered in the past two years. Not only are there many dragon veins converging spiritual energy here, but there are also quite a few high-quality Xuanyuan bloodlines. If developed properly, it can definitely cultivate a group of pillars of the state, which will be of great benefit to us several forces.</p><p></p><p>No matter what, we cannot let anyone destroy the Nine States.</p><p></p><p>I will immediately send out a summoning message, requesting the Divine Tiger Gate to arrange Divine Realm experts to come and guard it as soon as possible."</p><p></p><p>On the other hand, there was also a figure at the entrance of the library.</p><p></p><p>He had the appearance of a descendant of the Yan and Huang Emperors, looking quite clean and tidy, which made people can't help but feel a sense of fondness.</p><p></p><p>The Grandmaster-level inspector at the library entrance just glanced at him briefly and then smiled:</p><p></p><p>"You can go in."</p><p></p><p>"Thank you."</p><p></p><p>The other party stepped into the library, not looking for any cultivation methods, but only heading upstairs.</p><p></p><p>The seemingly gentle face gradually became gloomy, and the two pupils flashed with a cold blue light, revealing a trace of ruthlessness and barely concealed killing intent.</p><p></p><p>"It is said that two years ago, the strongest existence of the human race in the Nine States was the Sword Immortal.</p><p></p><p>The place where the Sword Immortal most often appeared was this Jianghai City.</p><p></p><p>I wonder if I can find information about him here. As long as I can find evidence of him slaying that powerful star beast, I can stand up to the Xuanyuan Divine Clan.</p><p></p><p>The divine blood of hundreds of billions of descendants of the three clans, such a huge force, cannot be completely taken by the damned Xuanyuan Divine Clan.</p><p></p><p>If they want my three clans' divine blood, they must pay the corresponding price!"</p>

        <h1>Chapter 315</h1>
        <div class="content">
            <p>Here is the full English translation of the Chinese excerpt:</p><p></p><p>Forget it, after all, it's the manager's thing, and the manager himself doesn't feel sorry for it, so why should I feel sorry?</p><p></p><p>Moreover, it's just feeding the manager's little animals.</p><p></p><p>However, a few minutes later, Ning Yuhen and Youwei, who had come to the Star Beast Breeding Farm, were completely dumbfounded.</p><p></p><p>Ning Yuhen: "(⊙.⊙)!"</p><p></p><p>Youwei: "(⊙.⊙)!"</p><p></p><p>Huanliuli: "!"</p><p></p><p>This was the effect she wanted.</p><p></p><p>To be honest, this feeling is really great!</p><p></p><p>Every time she sees others being embarrassed and shocked by Ye Xiao's terribleness, she feels a strange excitement.</p><p></p><p>Although she's not quite sure why she has such a weird feeling, she just feels great about it.</p><p></p><p>As for Ning Yuhen and Youwei, they simply couldn't believe their eyes.</p><p></p><p>What did they see? A large group of star beasts, with the weakest being at the Divine Ancestor level, and the strongest even reaching the Divine Beast Realm, were all being raised in this breeding farm.</p><p></p><p>These are the "little animals" the manager was talking about?</p><p></p><p>How are these guys little?</p><p></p><p>Whether male or female, they're all huge.</p><p></p><p>They're so big that if they were released outside, a single stomp could make an entire area tremble.</p><p></p><p>Yet at this moment, they were behaving obediently like a group of puppies.</p><p></p><p>There was even a Divine Beast Realm blue ox star beast selling thousand-year-old ginseng in exchange for immortal herbs.</p><p></p><p>The two of them felt like they were dreaming, as this was simply too unbelievable.</p><p></p><p>Noel Fis came up and greeted them with a smile.</p><p></p><p>"The Garrison Commander has come. And you've brought two new people today? One is a Grand Master! How trash! The master probably won't even look at her, let alone eat her.</p><p></p><p>The other one is not bad. He's actually at the Divine Beast Realm, but he doesn't seem to be a pure-blooded star beast. The master doesn't eat half-beasts, does he?"</p><p></p><p>Youwei: "(,,.,,,)!"</p><p></p><p>Does she not even have the qualifications to be fed to Ye Xiao? Is she that worthless?</p><p></p><p>Ning Yuhen coldly said:</p><p></p><p>"I'm not here to be fed to the manager, I'm the manager's subordinate, and I'm different from you."</p><p></p><p>But although he spoke firmly, his heart was shaken by a tumultuous storm!</p><p></p><p>No, five hundred years is not enough, he needs to add another five hundred years!</p><p></p><p>A thousand years!</p><p></p><p>He must serve the manager for a full thousand years before he can truly learn from him.</p><p></p><p>On the other side, Ye Xiao had already arrived in the Central State.</p><p></p><p>His perception ability was now extremely strong and wide-ranging.</p><p></p><p>So he immediately sensed that the pressure was greatest here and in the Southwest Forest where the White Tiger was located.</p><p></p><p>Therefore, he had to rush over to save the situation.</p><p></p><p>Otherwise, the formations here might not be able to hold out.</p><p></p><p>Cracks were already starting to appear in the formations of the Central State.</p><p></p><p>The fleet of spiritual energy ships coming to the Central State was even larger than the one heading to the Jianghai City.</p><p></p><p>The star beasts had no fixed landing spots, and they descended based solely on the density of the spiritual energy on the ground.</p><p></p><p>Where the spiritual energy was the thickest, there would be the largest human population.</p><p></p><p>The star beasts' only target was the human race!</p><p></p><p>So they would directly charge towards the human settlements, and the number of star beasts participating in the battle would be determined by the concentration of spiritual energy.</p><p></p><p>This is why there were only a few small Divine Ancestor star beasts in Han State.</p><p></p><p>Because Han State was too barren, it held little attraction for these star beasts.</p><p></p><p>The top-tier star beasts coming here were a complete waste of their time.</p><p></p><p>At this moment, under the attack of the star beast fleet, the defenses of the Central State were about to reach a critical point. Another attack could easily break through the formations.</p><p></p><p>Several half-step Supernal star beasts stood at the forefront of the fleet, observing the situation.</p><p></p><p>"Unexpectedly, the human race has quite some skill, to be able to set up formations to this extent."</p><p></p><p>"Yes! This time, we star beasts have almost mobilized en masse, and with the Seven Stars Convergence blessing, our strength is truly formidable. Even the spiritual energy cannons are from the Star Battlefield.</p><p></p><p>Yet they've managed to withstand this for so long!"</p><p></p><p>"But what's the use? In the end, they will still be broken.</p><p></p><p>We have gathered a large number of powerful figures from the Star Rank.</p><p></p><p>Reidur, ranked 46th on the Star Rank!</p><p>Cahir, ranked 44th on the Star Rank!</p><p>Moon Goddess, ranked 43rd on the Star Rank! And Denglong, ranked 39th on the Star Rank! They are already at the peak of the Divine Beast Realm, approaching the Half-step Supernal. Now with the Seven Stars Convergence blessing, their strength has increased exponentially, almost reaching the Emperor Realm.</p><p></p><p>There is no region of the human race in this world that can be our opponent."</p><p></p><p>"Let's not waste any more time. Many of the star beasts from the other states have already completed their missions, suppressing the human race throughout the year. We in the Nine States haven't had any good news yet. The Supernal Elders will blame us for our incompetence.</p><p></p><p>Crush them all, completely destroy the human race below."</p><p></p><p>"Understood!"</p><p></p><p>The words had just fallen when suddenly, one of the half-step Supernal star beasts, who seemed to have extremely strong perception, suddenly spoke up:</p><p></p><p>Here is the full English translation of the Chinese excerpt:</p><p></p><p>"Wait, something doesn't seem right. Is something coming?"</p><p></p><p>"What is it?"</p><p></p><p>The other star beasts couldn't help but raise their eyebrows slightly, not quite understanding her words.</p><p></p><p>Her face was extremely grave, with a layer of cold sweat on her forehead.</p><p></p><p>"It's not right! Very wrong, this feeling, it's the Emperor Realm! The human Emperor Realm is coming! Retreat quickly! Retreat back to the starry sky! It will be too late if we delay."</p><p></p><p>The other star beasts immediately tensed up.</p><p></p><p>"Moon Goddess, you're not joking with us, are you? The human Emperor Realm only has six in total, and they are all surrounded by Lin Shen and the others on the starry battlefield. </p><p></p><p>How could they possibly come here?"</p><p></p><p>"It's not them! This aura is not theirs! There is a new Emperor Realm expert from the human race! Damn it, hurry up and leave! You bunch of idiots, have you lost your minds? Hurry!"</p><p></p><p>Before she could finish speaking, a golden light beam rapidly shot over from the west.</p><p></p><p>The Boundless Calamity Finger!</p><p></p><p>Ye Xiao had only used an Emperor Technique.</p><p></p><p>In the Jianghai City, he had attacked from below, with countless Jianghai City civilians around him. </p><p></p><p>So he couldn't hold back his strength, and had to release the full force of the spiritual energy cannon's shockwave to push it back, ultimately annihilating those half-step Transcendent and Deity Realm rare delicacies.</p><p></p><p>But here, he didn't need to worry about that. </p><p></p><p>The formation below was still supporting, and he didn't need to attack from below, but could directly attack from the side.</p><p></p><p>This way, he could slowly slaughter them with Emperor Techniques and collect the ingredients.</p><p></p><p>But even just an Emperor Technique, Ye Xiao was now an Emperor Realm expert.</p><p></p><p>So when he released the Emperor Technique, he didn't even use his full strength, but the power was still formidable.</p><p></p><p>That finger's power instantly radiated out hundreds of thousands of meters.</p><p></p><p>Wherever the light passed, it pierced through everything in its path with invincible might.</p><p></p><p>Regardless of your cultivation, in the face of this finger, you would be reduced to ashes.</p><p></p><p>Nearly a hundred spiritual energy ships were pierced through by Ye Xiao's finger, losing control and falling down like dumplings.</p><p></p><p>Among them was a神beast expert on the level of a Human Monarch, whose half body was blasted into ash.</p><p></p><p>He had just been boasting about devouring all the humans, but now he was terrified like a mouse seeing a cat, instantly fleeing as a beam of light towards the other spiritual energy ships.</p><p></p><p>"So strong!"</p><p></p><p>Those half-step Transcendent ones, seeing this scene, couldn't help but have their hair stand on end, as if they had received some great stimulation.</p><p></p><p>"Quick! Aim all the spiritual energy cannons at that direction. Hurry! Fire with full force, while retreating and fleeing."</p><p></p><p>Originally they hadn't felt that terrifying, but now they realized they were truly mistaken.</p><p></p><p>All the spiritual energy cannons, under their command, were aimed at Ye Xiao's direction and fired frantically.</p><p></p><p>The thousands to tens of thousands of cannon blasts per second completely covered the western sky, leaving no gaps at all.</p><p></p><p>The huge explosive force shook the spiritual energy in the air, rolling like ocean waves.</p><p></p><p>Some star beasts who had just reached the Primal Realm were unable to control their bodies in this turbulent spiritual energy.</p><p></p><p>The spiritual energy ships even started to sway.</p><p></p><p>However, just as this powerful firepower coverage was starting to give them some relief, they realized their mistake the next moment, and it was a huge one.</p><p></p><p>They should not have resisted, the only thing they could do now was flee! Flee as fast as possible!</p><p></p><p>But unfortunately, there is no regret medicine in this world.</p><p></p><p>By the time they started regretting, they had already lost all their chances.</p><p></p><p>A sword beam fell from the clouds, ruthlessly slicing open a big hole in the cannon blasts.</p><p></p><p>The sword beam landed in the middle of the spiritual energy ship fleet, its power no less than that previous finger.</p><p></p><p>This one sword strike cut two hundred spiritual energy ships in half, making them plummet down.</p><p></p><p>The shock had not ended, as the star beasts were in a panic, they saw a pure golden light beam, charging through the spiritual energy cannons with unstoppable force!</p><p></p><p>Yes!</p><p></p><p>It was directly charging through the spiritual energy cannons, defending with its own flesh, without even using any techniques.</p><p></p><p>One must know that such dense and rich spiritual energy cannon attacks would severely injure anyone below the Emperor Realm.</p><p></p><p>"No, he's not trying to kill us."</p><p></p><p>A half-step Transcendent star beast seemed to have figured something out.</p><p></p><p>An Emperor Realm expert, at this moment, could have easily killed them with a single move, but instead he was chasing them like a cat chasing a mouse.</p><p></p><p>Although his speed was still quite fast, for an Emperor Realm expert, there was no need to do this.</p><p></p><p>The only explanation was that he had other intentions.</p><p></p><p>The next moment, they saw Ye Xiao's big hand pierce through the chest of a神beast, crushing its heart and suppressing its power, then throwing it into his spatial storage ring.</p><p></p><p>(This chapter ends)</p>

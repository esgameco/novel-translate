        <h1>Chapter 163</h1>
        <div class="content">
            <p>Here is the full English translation of the Chinese excerpt:</p><p></p><p>Ye Xiao was not online, so he was not aware of these matters, but he could vaguely guess some of them.</p><p></p><p>However, it doesn't matter, because he didn't leave any information behind, so no one will know who he is.</p><p></p><p>Even if they remember his appearance, it is a disguised false face.</p><p></p><p>What made him more delighted was that he obtained the spatial amethyst.</p><p></p><p>After obtaining this item, Ye Xiao immediately purchased a large amount of forging materials in the city of Hu.</p><p></p><p>It must be said that Hu City is ultimately an international metropolis with a strong foundation, and he could easily find some relatively rare materials that Ye Xiao needed.</p><p></p><p>There were plenty of soft gold, tungsten steel, and meteorite iron.</p><p></p><p>However, the value of these things is not cheap, adding up to a staggering tens of millions.</p><p></p><p>Ye Xiao did not have enough cash, but he had enough feathers, all of which were plucked from the wings of Ji Feng, and Ye Xiao had never thrown them away.</p><p></p><p>The feathers of the divine emperor beast are also not cheap, but they make up for it with their large quantity.</p><p></p><p>So, he found a black market and, with a large number of Ji Feng's feathers, Ye Xiao easily obtained the materials he wanted.</p><p></p><p>This made him think of another good way to get rich. In the future, when he raises Ji Feng, he can pluck her feathers, as they are also quite valuable.</p><p></p><p>After taking the materials, Ye Xiao left the city of Hu.</p><p></p><p>He originally wanted to go to the martial arts library in Hu City to see if there were any suitable basic cultivation techniques.</p><p></p><p>But the management of the martial arts library in Hu City was very strict, requiring a local temporary residence certificate and various identity documents, so in the end, Ye Xiao didn't go in.</p><p></p><p>Afterwards, Ye Xiao came to a deep mountain forest and began to forge his new storage ring.</p><p></p><p>Using the spatial amethyst as the raw material, he purified and compressed it to form an extremely small gem, then fused it with materials like soft gold and tungsten steel, giving it expandability, extensibility, and a certain degree of rigidity.</p><p></p><p>Then he transferred all the spatial power stored in the original storage ring to the new storage ring, greatly increasing the spatial storage capacity of this storage ring.</p><p></p><p>In addition, he also set up a micro-scale Dizhao Tiangang formation in the storage ring to protect it from being broken, and to ensure that any living beings stored in the storage ring cannot escape without his permission.</p><p></p><p>And protective array formations like preservation arrays are also indispensable.</p><p></p><p>Moreover, in order to ensure that the living things stored in the future will not harm his storage, Ye Xiao did not make the storage ring into a complete storage space.</p><p></p><p>In addition to using a large piece of amethyst for the main space, Ye Xiao also inlaid several small amethysts on the ring, which could also form some special storage spaces.</p><p></p><p>He then individually set up formations in each small space, making it perfect.</p><p></p><p>The body of the ring is made of a tungsten steel and soft gold alloy, appearing as a pure black ring, while the inside of the ring conceals the spatial amethyst, so that it can easily shield the spatial amethyst, and others will not know that this is a spatial ring, thinking it is just an ordinary ring worn for style.</p><p></p><p>The space inside the new spatial storage ring is already as large as four football fields.</p><p></p><p>Compared to the previous two three-story villas, this is like heaven and earth. It was not in vain that Ye Xiao specially came to the city of Hu to take this spatial amethyst.</p><p></p><p>Afterwards, Ye Xiao collected all the materials into the ring, including the bodies of several divine emperor-level star beasts.</p><p></p><p>After returning to the city of Jianghai, he can revive and raise them.</p><p></p><p>This trip can be said to be a complete success, with seven divine emperor-level star beasts and a storage ring with a space the size of four football fields.</p><p></p><p>Speaking of this storage ring alone, it is likely that there are few in the world, and it is absolutely a private possession. There are probably only Ye Xiao's in private hands.</p><p></p><p>Only on the Star Battlefield would there be such large-scale storage rings used to transport cultivators.</p><p></p><p>After completing all this, he can return to the city of Jianghai.</p><p></p><p>However, at this moment, a black lightning suddenly flashed out from the jungle, mixed with a strong killing intent, rushing towards the back of Ye Xiao's head.</p><p></p><p>It was a black Haoshi star beast at the peak of the Transcendent realm, just a step away from entering the Patriarch realm.</p><p></p><p>Its speed was extremely fast, and its sharp teeth in its blood-red mouth were like four rows of steel saws. For cultivators below the Patriarch realm, if bitten, their necks would be directly severed, and their heads would fly off.</p><p></p><p>But Ye Xiao was not the least bit flustered.</p><p></p><p>Although this black Haoshi star beast was very strong, Ye Xiao was already at the Divine Emperor realm, not to mention that he also cultivated the Indestructible Divine Skill, and was wearing an Emperor's Armament-grade armor.</p><p></p><p>If the black Haoshi star beast really bit him, its teeth would likely be crushed to pieces.</p><p></p><p>However, unfortunately, it did not reach Ye Xiao.</p><p></p><p>As soon as it leapt out, in the next moment, an even faster beam of light suddenly shot out.</p><p></p><p>Boom! That beam of light directly pierced through its head, and then pinned it to the nearby mountain rock, killing it.</p><p></p><p>The black Haoshi star beast shook a few times and completely lost its life.</p><p></p><p>Here is the full English translation of the Chinese excerpt:</p><p></p><p>Xiao looked in another direction and saw a woman who seemed to be in her forties.</p><p></p><p>However, her bone age was actually over seventy, but because her cultivation had broken through to the innate second-grade sect master realm, she appeared much younger.</p><p></p><p>She glanced at Ye Xiao, her expression a bit displeased, and said coldly:</p><p></p><p>"Didn't you see the announcement from the Lin City Garrison? No one is allowed to set foot on this mountain, it's very dangerous, you know? If it weren't for me just now, you would have died."</p><p></p><p>Ye Xiao replied calmly, "I'm from out of town, I was just passing by and stopped to rest for a bit."</p><p></p><p>Hearing this, the woman eyed Ye Xiao with some suspicion, but seeing that he didn't seem to be lying, her tone became slightly more gentle.</p><p></p><p>"In that case, you should hurry and go down the mountain, it's not safe up here."</p><p></p><p>Ye Xiao nodded and turned to leave.</p><p></p><p>As soon as he turned around, several figures quickly approached the female warrior.</p><p></p><p>"Commander Lin, the formation has been set up on the mountain. As long as those star beasts run out, they will die for sure when they step into the formation."</p><p></p><p>Commander Lin nodded.</p><p></p><p>"Everyone, work a little harder these two days and search more. For some reason, this mountain has attracted so many star beasts. If we don't eliminate them thoroughly, it will be a huge threat to the citizens of Lin City."</p><p></p><p>"Yes, ma'am!" </p><p></p><p>The group responded in unison and resumed their intense search.</p><p></p><p>Ye Xiao was slightly curious about their words.</p><p></p><p>If a mountain suddenly attracted the reaction of star beasts, could it be that there was something good there?</p><p></p><p>With a thought, the Taixuan Heavenly Gale immediately scanned the entire mountain, and in an instant, the divine spirit of the Golden Book in Ye Xiao's body trembled.</p><p></p><p>"This is... the Divine Palm of Tathagata?"</p><p></p><p>Ye Xiao was somewhat startled.</p><p></p><p>He actually sensed the power of the Divine Palm of Tathagata within the mountain.</p><p></p><p>However, it seemed to have been there for a very long time, so the Buddhist power in the Divine Palm had almost disappeared.</p><p></p><p>In the interior of the mountain, in addition to the Divine Palm of Tathagata, there were also several extremely powerful resentful spirits.</p><p></p><p>The resentful spirits were constantly attacking the Buddhist power, waiting for the Buddhist power to be completely destroyed, then the resentful spirits would spread out like a tidal wave. The spiritual power of these resentful spirits, when concentrated, had already reached the peak of the innate sixth-grade sect master realm.</p><p></p><p>If they were to break through the seal, they would bring a devastating disaster to the Lin City below. The city of millions would be drenched in blood, and countless lives would be slaughtered.</p><p></p><p>Ye Xiao's mind stirred, and he immediately used the Earth Traversal Technique to sink into the ground.</p><p></p><p>Underground, Ye Xiao found a spacious area of over a hundred cubic meters within the mountain.</p><p></p><p>An old monk in a tattered robe was seated in a cross-legged position, his hands clasped in a devout posture, having already attained Buddhahood.</p><p></p><p>Next to him was a storage ring, from which the power of the Divine Palm of Tathagata was emanating.</p><p></p><p>In front of him was a blood pool, flowing with thick polluted blood mixed with an extremely dense aura of evil and killing intent.</p><p></p><p>Occasionally, a resentful spirit would emerge from the pool.</p><p></p><p>"Human! It's a human! Such delicious meat scent!"</p><p></p><p>Its cold, bloodthirsty voice rang out, and the other resentful spirits, seeing Ye Xiao, also emerged from the blood pool, their gaze fixed on him.</p><p></p><p>"Haha, it really is a human! I haven't eaten a human in a long time, let me eat him!"</p><p></p><p>"Brothers, break this seal, come on, hurry!"</p><p></p><p>Seeing Ye Xiao, a living human, the resentful spirits became even more excited, their eyes glowing with red light, eager to break the seal and tear Ye Xiao to shreds.</p><p></p><p>Under their assault, the Buddhist power from the old monk was growing weaker and weaker, and his skeletal frame began to tremble, clearly on the verge of collapse.</p><p></p><p>Boom! Ye Xiao did not hesitate, directly striking with the Divine Palm of Tathagata.</p><p></p><p>This palm strike shattered the blood pool, and the resentful spirits within were instantly reduced to fragments, but they quickly reformed, becoming wave after wave of resentful spirits.</p><p></p><p>"The Divine Palm of Tathagata! So you are a disciple of the Divine Palm of Tathagata!"</p><p></p><p>"But even with the Divine Palm of Tathagata, it is not enough to completely destroy us. We are resentful spirits formed by the power of the soul and the filthy blood, and the Buddhist power alone cannot annihilate us!"</p><p></p><p>Ye Xiao was not panicked. The Taixuan Heavenly Gale scanned them, and he immediately understood that they had a virtual-physical combined body, so in addition to the Divine Palm of Tathagata attack, he also needed a spiritual attack.</p><p></p><p>This was simple then.</p><p></p><p>"Farewell."</p><p></p><p>The resentful spirits: "???"</p><p></p><p>Before they could understand what was happening, the next moment, Ye Xiao used the Taixuan Heavenly Gale to control his spiritual power and infuse it into the Divine Palm of Tathagata, striking down again.</p><p></p><p>This palm strike completely reduced several resentful spirits to ashes.</p><p></p><p>Ye Xiao then approached the Buddha-attained high monk.</p><p></p><p>Three in the morning, nine thousand.</p><p></p><p>Thank you, reader Dennis Du, for your generous reward. I'm deeply grateful.</p><p></p><p>(This chapter is complete)</p>

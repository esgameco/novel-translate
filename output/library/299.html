        <h1>Chapter 299</h1>
        <div class="content">
            <p>Here is the full English translation of the Chinese excerpt:</p><p></p><p>"Impressive!" </p><p></p><p>The Demon Empress couldn't help but glance up at the battle in the sky, and her heart started to beat faster in awe.</p><p></p><p>Is this what a battle at the Deity Beast Realm looks like?</p><p></p><p>Although their cultivation bases were only slightly stronger than hers.</p><p></p><p>But the power they unleashed was unimaginably greater, many times more than hers! This is the terrifying might of the Deity Beast Realm experts! Deity Beasts are truly extraordinary, and even half-Deity Beasts are still far from the true Deity Beast experts, with an unbridgeable gap between them.</p><p></p><p>The longer the battle lasted, the more the sky flashed with brilliant lights.</p><p></p><p>This cycle continued endlessly, quickly causing the spiritual energy in the air to reach a critical point.</p><p></p><p>At this moment, the Wolf God and Ning Yutian exchanged a powerful punch, directly blasting each other back.</p><p></p><p>"Pant, pant."</p><p></p><p>After the intense attacks, both Ning Yutian and the Wolf God were in a state of fluctuating spiritual energy.</p><p></p><p>But the Wolf God clearly had the upper hand.</p><p></p><p>Ning Yutian's breathing was noticeably faster.</p><p></p><p>The Wolf God smiled slightly.</p><p></p><p>"Not bad, really not bad. I didn't expect the inheritance you obtained to be so powerful. I can feel that your breakthrough couldn't have taken much time. There must be something good in that Imperial Realm inheritance, otherwise you couldn't have reached this level so quickly.</p><p></p><p>Once I defeat you, I'll have to go take a look at what's in that Imperial Realm relic."</p><p></p><p>"You won't get the chance." </p><p></p><p>Ning Yutian's expression was indifferent. The Wolf God's eyes narrowed, as if he vaguely sensed something unusual in Ning Yutian's words.</p><p></p><p>The next moment, his pupils suddenly constricted, because countless dazzling starlight dots had formed in the air.</p><p></p><p>Each starlight dot was filled with massive energy, the spiritual energy that had been expended in Ning Yutian and his battle just now.</p><p></p><p>But at this moment, all this spiritual energy had converged into a single point, and was continuously contracting towards the two of them.</p><p></p><p>"What is this...?"</p><p></p><p>"This is a secret technique of our Silver Fox Clan, the Stellar Explosion. It gathers the spiritual energy we scattered during our battle and detonates it all in an instant, annihilating all life within the technique's range without leaving a single survivor."</p><p></p><p>The Wolf God's forehead was beaded with cold sweat, and he sneered coldly:</p><p></p><p>"Are you joking? If you use this technique, won't you die too? The spiritual energy contains mine as well, don't tell me you can survive it."</p><p></p><p>Ning Yutian's mouth curved up slightly.</p><p></p><p>"You're smart, but you've forgotten one thing.</p><p></p><p>That is, the Silver Fox Clan also has the inherited Tail Replacement Technique. I only need to cut off one of my tails, and I can revive afterwards, but you, I'm afraid you'll have to say goodbye to this world."</p><p></p><p>"Bastard!" </p><p></p><p>The Wolf God roared and lunged towards Ning Yutian.</p><p></p><p>But it was too late, Ning Yutian grabbed the starlight, which instantly converged and detonated.</p><p></p><p>In the sky, a dazzlingly brilliant light flashed, illuminating the surrounding starry sky and the Silver Fox Valley.</p><p></p><p>The powerful shockwaves from the explosion blew fierce winds that made the Silver Fox Valley tremble.</p><p></p><p>All the Star Beasts could no longer continue fighting, only lying on the ground to avoid being blown away by the turbulent air currents.</p><p></p><p>The entire process lasted for dozens of seconds before finally stopping.</p><p></p><p>The Star Beasts immediately raised their heads, wanting to see what was happening in the sky.</p><p></p><p>If either side lost, the Star Beasts would no longer need to keep fighting, for without the protection of the Deity Beasts, they would just be cannon fodder with no meaning.</p><p></p><p>When the light in the sky dissipated, the distorted air revealed Ning Yutian's figure, fully restored except for one missing tail. The originally nine-tailed Ning Yutian now had only eight tails, his face slightly pale.</p><p></p><p>To his surprise, the Wolf God had not fallen under that attack, but his body was riddled with bloody holes, one of his arms missing, his entire form broken and barely clinging to life.</p><p></p><p>"Pant, pant."</p><p></p><p>The Wolf God panted heavily, his icy gaze fixed on Ning Yutian, his teeth gritted.</p><p></p><p>"You despicable bastard, using such a vile method. You made me underestimate you. If I didn't have a life-saving technique, I might have really fallen for your scheme."</p><p></p><p>Ning Yutian snorted lightly. After all, the other was an old-school Deity Beast, not easily slain.</p><p></p><p>"So what? Even if that last attack didn't kill you, how long can you last in your current state? I can annihilate you in an instant."</p><p></p><p>"Hahaha..."</p><p></p><p>The Wolf God burst into laughter.</p><p></p><p>"What are you laughing about?"</p><p></p><p>Ning Yutian's eyes turned cold, and the Wolf God continued:</p><p></p><p>"I laugh at your foolishness! Do you really think I didn't leave myself a backup plan? At the moment of your self-detonation, I had already released my will to summon the several divine..."</p><p></p><p>Here is the full English translation of the Chinese excerpt:</p><p></p><p>"Beast, do you think you can continue to be arrogant? Do you think you can continue to do anything to me? How ridiculous! Just look behind you."</p><p></p><p>The Wolf God spoke, and Ning Yuhen's pupils contracted. He knew the other party was not joking, because he had already felt it - several extremely powerful auras had arrived behind him.</p><p></p><p>These powerful auras, each one, possessed a force that made his heart tremble.</p><p></p><p>Each one was an old-line King Realm expert.</p><p></p><p>"Shaping Wind Wolf, you have truly brought shame to Lord Forest God! To deal with a mere newly promoted King Realm cultivator, yet you were beaten to this extent, and now have to seek our help - this is a disgrace to Lord Forest God!" </p><p></p><p>The Shaping Wind Wolf bitterly smiled.</p><p></p><p>"You all are right, I have brought shame to Lord Forest God. However, I was left with no choice. Please lend a hand and subdue this person. Down below, there is a legacy of the Human Emperor Realm, which we can divide among ourselves!"</p><p></p><p>"A legacy of the Human Emperor Realm? Well, well, it turns out to be a big fish after all, haha."</p><p></p><p>The moment these words fell, Ning Yuhen suddenly felt a massive impact force assaulting his back. He wanted to dodge, but the other party's speed was too fast, he couldn't evade it at all.</p><p></p><p>Boom! Accompanied by a thunderous sound, Ning Yuhen felt his entire back being torn apart.</p><p></p><p>His body instantly transformed into a shooting star, violently crashing into the ground. The powerful impact force allowed him to pierce through a thousand-meter-high mountain cliff, and heavily slam into the ground, creating a vast chasm tens of thousands of feet in diameter.</p><p></p><p>The earth cracked open like a spider web, the powerful force generating shockwaves that even caused massive casualties among the Silver Fox Clan members and the Shaping Wind Wolf's subordinates.</p><p></p><p>"Yuhen!" </p><p></p><p>The Fox Empress quickly jumped over, embracing Ning Yuhen, and exerting all her strength to use the Chenxing Technique to help him recover.</p><p></p><p>Ning Yuhen gritted his teeth.</p><p></p><p>"Grandmother, I'm sorry, I'm still not strong enough to protect the Silver Fox Clan."</p><p></p><p>The Fox Empress shook her head.</p><p></p><p>"Silly child, you've done your best. This is not your fault. The enemies are just too strong!"</p><p></p><p>She raised her head to look at the figures in the starry sky, her eyes revealing a deep sense of despair.</p><p></p><p>Ranked 131st on the Star Ranking - Qingbird Yuwonji.</p><p>Ranked 124th on the Star Ranking - Swallowing Moon Hound Entombing Dragon.</p><p>Ranked 115th on the Star Ranking - Baiyao Starlight Brilliance!</p><p>Ranked 114th on the Star Ranking - Iron Armor Rhino Thunder Shock!</p><p>Ranked 109th on the Star Ranking - Flower God Zhuixin!</p><p></p><p>The five who came this time were all Spiritual Beast Realm experts, and moreover, they were all high-ranking existences on the Star Ranking.</p><p></p><p>In comparison, the Shaping Wind Wolf was only just barely reaching around the 190th position on the Star Ranking.</p><p></p><p>The gap between them was enormous.</p><p></p><p>Ning Yuhen and the Shaping Wind Wolf, who was around the 190th position on the Star Ranking, had fought a difficult battle, and had to rely on the Silver Fox Clan's secret techniques to severely injure him, not even able to achieve a one-hit kill.</p><p></p><p>Let alone confronting these Stellar Beast experts.</p><p></p><p>"Yuhen, listen to your grandmother.</p><p></p><p>These Stellar Beasts are the strongest of the strong, old-line Spiritual Beast Realm existences.</p><p></p><p>You won't be able to withstand them, but by using the Silver Fox Clan's secret techniques, you still have a chance to escape. You must flee, otherwise the Silver Fox Clan will be annihilated."</p><p></p><p>Hearing these words, Ning Yuhen's heart trembled.</p><p></p><p>"Grandmother, I won't leave!"</p><p></p><p>"You listen to me. If you stay here, we will all die, and you won't be able to hide either. If Lord Ye were here, we would naturally have no fear.</p><p></p><p>But entering the Emperor Realm also carries great risks. No one knows whether he can come out.</p><p></p><p>If he could come out, he should have done so already, but until now, he still hasn't come out.</p><p></p><p>I can't gamble, do you understand? You must live on to continue the Silver Fox Clan's bloodline."</p><p></p><p>Ning Yuhen bit his lip tightly.</p><p></p><p>"I won't leave! I want to share the same fate as the Silver Fox Clan."</p><p></p><p>Ning Yuhen had been drifting and wandering all his life.</p><p></p><p>All these years, it was only in the Silver Fox Clan that he had found the warmth of a home.</p><p></p><p>If the Silver Fox Clan was destroyed, and he had to live alone, he would not be able to bear the burden.</p><p></p><p>So he would rather stay and face it together with the Silver Fox Clan.</p><p></p><p>The Fox Empress patted his little head.</p><p></p><p>"You silly child, you really have the same temperament as your mother. But I can't let the Silver Fox Clan be completely annihilated, can I?"</p><p></p><p>As soon as she finished speaking, those auras descended.</p><p></p><p>"You two don't need to argue anymore, in front of us, do you think he can still run away?"</p><p></p><p>"Since we've already made a move today, it's a fight to the death. Do you think we'll let him go, waiting for him to come back for revenge in the future?"</p><p></p><p>The Fox Empress and Ning Yuhen's faces darkened.</p><p></p><p>This time, the trouble was serious.</p><p></p><p>But just at this moment, in the east of the starry sky, a purple cloud suddenly gathered.</p><p></p><p>When the purple cloud appeared, the originally calm wind suddenly began to howl.</p><p></p><p>Everyone frowned.</p><p></p><p>"What's going on?"</p>

        <h1>Chapter 332</h1>
        <div class="content">
            <p>Here is the full English translation of the Chinese excerpt:</p><p></p><p>Ye Xiao collected the corpses of the super-divine star beasts he had slain and stored them in his spatial ring, intending to keep them for later use, before descending.</p><p></p><p>He activated the Eternal Life Technique to quickly heal the injuries of the two Empyrean Realm seniors.</p><p></p><p>The terrifying power of the divine-level healing art was fully displayed, as the injuries on their bodies were rapidly repaired at a visible speed.</p><p></p><p>Emperor Jing and Emperor Yun had just witnessed Ye Xiao's terrifying abilities, and now, experiencing it firsthand, they felt even more awestruck.</p><p></p><p>"Azure Dragon Senior, could you please introduce us?"</p><p></p><p>"Alright."</p><p></p><p>Azure Dragon nodded and introduced the three of them:</p><p></p><p>"This is Ye Xiao. These two are Empyrean Realm experts from the human race in the Star Battlefield. This one is Senior Patriarch Zhu of the Emperor Jing, and this one is Senior Patriarch Xuan of the Emperor Yun.</p><p></p><p>Over the past few hundred years, they have been defending the human race on the Star Battlefield."</p><p></p><p>Ye Xiao nodded.</p><p></p><p>"I've long heard of the reputations of you two seniors. It is an honor to meet you today."</p><p></p><p>The two felt ashamed. "Not at all, in the face of your performance today, we two are truly insignificant."</p><p></p><p>Azure Dragon chuckled and then spoke:</p><p></p><p>"His achievements are not limited to just this. </p><p></p><p>When the beast calamity descended, the human race across the world, except for the Nine States, was basically wiped out. If it weren't for him, the Nine States would have been destroyed as well.</p><p></p><p>It was because of the formation he set up that the entire human population of the Nine States was protected.</p><p></p><p>Later, he even unlocked the Emperor's Stele, allowing the past emperors to transform into dragon qi and reactivate the dragon veins, establishing the Great Wall Formation, and guarding the national borders alone, preventing the star beasts from crossing.</p><p></p><p>Within the Nine States, not a single person was injured because of him.</p><p></p><p>Most importantly, he is only twenty-one years old this year."</p><p></p><p>Boom! This introduction caused the two men's minds to be instantly shaken, as if a huge bomb had been dropped on them.</p><p></p><p>It made the two Empyrean Realm experts respect him deeply, their expressions becoming much more serious.</p><p></p><p>"Good lad, you've really opened our eyes today."</p><p></p><p>Ye Xiao replied calmly, "In the face of crisis, the people of the Nine States should naturally all contribute their efforts. If someone else had my power, I'm sure they would have done the same."</p><p></p><p>"But that person just happens to be you, not someone else, so you don't need to be so modest. Even we two couldn't come up with any solutions, thinking the Nine States might truly be doomed, but in the end, you turned out to be this great hero.</p><p></p><p>It's as if the heavens haven't abandoned the Nine States.</p><p></p><p>More importantly, you've accomplished the dream of the human race of the Nine States throughout history - unlocking the Emperor's Stele and obtaining the inheritance of our ancestors.</p><p></p><p>This really makes us Empyrean Realm experts pale in comparison.</p><p></p><p>No wonder you are so strong!"</p><p></p><p>Ye Xiao smiled wryly, feeling that this praise was a bit excessive.</p><p></p><p>In fact, he felt that from the beginning until now, in his over a year of cultivation, he hadn't really experienced any major storms or waves, just passing through smoothly.</p><p></p><p>He never expected to be seen as so important in the eyes of others.</p><p></p><p>After a pause, Emperor Yun spoke again:</p><p></p><p>"But now is not the time to be happy, there is another more important matter that needs to be dealt with."</p><p></p><p>Azure Dragon and Ye Xiao looked at him with slight confusion, and Emperor Jing spoke:</p><p></p><p>"To be precise, there are two matters. The first is that the Western Wolf Emperor, the Southern Vajra Great Emperor, and the Russian Thunder Emperor have all self-detonated their blood qi, in order to incite the three great divine tribes behind them to come and seek revenge."</p><p></p><p>Ye Xiao was taken aback, somewhat puzzled. "This logic doesn't seem quite right. If they can summon the powerful experts from their divine tribes through self-detonation, why didn't they do that from the beginning? If they had directly summoned their divine tribe members, even with all the star beasts, they wouldn't pose any threat, right?"</p><p></p><p>Emperor Jing shook his head.</p><p></p><p>"It's not like that. In this world, the human race, except for us the descendants of Xuanyuan, have all been exiled here. The other human tribes were banished here for violating their tribal rules.</p><p></p><p>We, the descendants of Xuanyuan, are unwilling to summon the Xuanyuan Divine Tribe behind us, for fear that the ancestral secret we discovered, will be plundered by the divine tribe.</p><p></p><p>That secret is something our ancestors painstakingly searched the entire universe to find.</p><p></p><p>If we let the stronger Xuanyuan Divine Tribe members take it away, it will be a lifelong regret for our ancestors.</p><p></p><p>The other human tribes, being exiled, have no way to summon their divine tribes, and even if they did, the other side wouldn't come.</p><p></p><p>But now, the other human tribes have all been completely wiped out by the star beasts, and their divine blood has been extracted. The nature of this matter is different.</p><p></p><p>This is a taboo among the divine tribes, so this time, their ancestral divine tribes will definitely come.</p><p></p><p>Of course, it's not necessarily just to avenge them. Those divine tribes may come for their own face, or to try to gain some benefits."</p><p></p><p>Emperor Yun took over and said:</p><p></p><p>"The biggest problem is that the Star Realm must be ruled by the law of the jungle.</p><p></p><p>If those divine tribe experts really descend, and see that all the other races have been annihilated, leaving only us, it will be difficult to guarantee that they won't redirect their fury towards us.</p><p></p><p>At that time, not to mention completing our ancestors' wishes, whether we can even withstand the attacks of the other divine tribes will already be a blessing."</p><p></p><p>Ye Xiao's expression became grave.</p><p></p><p>What they said was correct. Although his strength was now very powerful, and he possessed several Emperor-level techniques,</p><p></p><p>Here is my translation of the Chinese excerpt:</p><p></p><p>In reality, even if we don't consider those divine tribes, just the star beasts alone are a major concern. Their numbers are growing year by year, and their experts are becoming more and more powerful. There may even be powerful experts from divine tribes controlling them behind the scenes.</p><p></p><p>The descendants of the Xuanyuan clan in the Nine Provinces have already become the meat on the chopping board for others.</p><p></p><p>We have reached a moment of grave crisis.</p><p></p><p>If the other Xuanyuan divine tribes were to come and try to seize the secret that our ancestors discovered, what would we do?</p><p></p><p>We can only gamble now. Gamble that the Xuanyuan divine experts summoned will not quickly discover that secret.</p><p></p><p>At the very least, we must ensure the survival of the human tribes of the Nine Provinces and help them get through this current crisis.</p><p></p><p>The key question is - who will carry out this summoning? Based on the current situation, this summoning is not something that can be done lightly. It may require the self-sacrifice of an Emperor-level expert.</p><p></p><p>This is the crux of the problem.</p><p></p><p>"What if we lose the gamble?" Qinglong asked solemnly.</p><p></p><p>The air grew heavy with tension.</p><p></p><p>"Qinglong, you should leave me a little face," Yun Emperor said with a wry smile.</p><p></p><p>Qinglong's expression was grave. "This matter concerns the descendants of Xuanyuan, our thousands of years of perseverance, and the precious treasures our ancestral founders left behind for us. We cannot afford to gamble, nor can we afford to lose."</p><p></p><p>Yun Emperor took a deep breath. "Since you insist on an answer, then I shall tell you. The answer is him!" He pointed at Ye Xiao.</p><p></p><p>"He has inherited the legacy of the Emperor's Stele. That means he has inherited the legacy of our ancestors! I will stake everything on him. I bet that he can find our ancestors' legacy. I bet that he can carry forward our ancestors' will and become a renowned figure among the Xuanyuan divine tribe!"</p><p></p><p>Ye Xiao's expression was solemn. "Senior Xuan, this responsibility is far too great. I fear I may not be able to bear it."</p><p></p><p>Yun Emperor laughed heartily. "Haha, no need to put so much pressure on yourself. At this point, everything has already been decided. Even if we don't consider the mystery left behind by our ancestors, we must ensure the survival of the human tribes of the Nine Provinces.</p><p></p><p>Without powerful experts to protect you and give you a chance to grow, we will truly have lost!"</p><p></p><p>After a pause, his expression turned serious.</p><p></p><p>"Five thousand years ago, our Xuanyuan tribal ancestors made tremendous sacrifices to ensure that we, their descendants, would no longer be mediocre, but could soar through the stars and explore countless worlds, eventually finding this place of treasure.</p><p></p><p>Today, for the sake of the prosperity of the Nine Provinces, I, Xuan, am willing to sacrifice my life. Was not the arduous sacrifice and effort of our ancestors the very secret behind the flourishing and prosperity of the Xuanyuan tribe?"</p>

        <h1>Chapter 321</h1>
        <div class="content">
            <p>Here is the full English translation of the Chinese excerpt:</p><p></p><p>"Of course not, esteemed elders. If you do not believe me, you can verify it on the spot."</p><p></p><p>Ye Xiao spoke with a resolute expression on his face.</p><p></p><p>He knew that these imperial spirit kings must have a way to reactivate the dragon vein, but they had already devoted all their heart and blood to the Nine Provinces, so now they no longer had the strength to contribute further - they were exhausted! What he needed to do now was to provide them with this power.</p><p></p><p>The power of confidence and courage!</p><p></p><p>The souls of the various emperors had begun to flicker on and off, just like a person's rapid breathing.</p><p></p><p>"To reach the Emperor Realm in just a year and a half, this speed is even faster than that of the Ancestor Dragon Emperor!"</p><p></p><p>"Could he be the Heavenly Mandate Son mentioned in the Ancestor's prophecy?"</p><p></p><p>"If that's the case, then perhaps he might be the one who can unravel the Ancestor's mysteries!"</p><p></p><p>The imperial spirit kings grew increasingly excited, their eyes shining brightly.</p><p></p><p>After a long while, one of the emperors finally spoke:</p><p></p><p>"This Imperial Spirit Stele was actually created by the Ancestor using his own essence blood. It contains the essence of the Ancestor's divine blood.</p><p></p><p>It has two functions: one is to collect the souls of Emperor Realm experts who have sacrificed their lives for the descendants of Xuanyuan, so that our souls will not dissipate in the heavens and earth.</p><p></p><p>The other function is as a test stone.</p><p></p><p>Within the Imperial Spirit Stele, there is a divine technique left behind by the Ancestor! If your aptitude is truly monstrous and can meet the Ancestor's requirements, this Imperial Spirit Stele will acknowledge your identity and pass down this divine technique to you.</p><p></p><p>If you can obtain this divine technique, it means there is still hope for the Nine Provinces, and the Ancestor's will can be fulfilled."</p><p></p><p>Ye Xiao did not expect that the Imperial Spirit Stele would still contain a divine technique.</p><p></p><p>However, at this moment, he was not very interested in the divine technique, what he cared about was the dragon vein.</p><p></p><p>"Esteemed elders, does that mean if I can obtain this divine technique and pass the test, you will tell me how to repair the dragon vein of the Nine Provinces?"</p><p></p><p>"Correct."</p><p></p><p>"Good! It's a deal then!"</p><p></p><p>Thinking of this, Ye Xiao immediately withdrew his mind from the Imperial Spirit Stele and began to interact with the Xuanyuan divine blood within, accepting the test.</p><p></p><p>He used his spiritual power, soul power, and vital energy to separately touch the stele, trying to sense the power within.</p><p></p><p>Inside the Imperial Spirit Stele, the imperial spirit kings watched this scene with growing tension.</p><p></p><p>"Can this kid make it?"</p><p></p><p>"Who knows. Since the fall of Ancestor Xuanyuan, countless heroes have tried to pass the test of the Imperial Spirit Stele. </p><p></p><p>But who has succeeded? Even we, the top geniuses of the human race, have all failed."</p><p></p><p>"It's so difficult! Even the Ancestor Dragon Emperor failed to pass this test, so unless this kid has some kind of cheat, there's no way he can pass it."</p><p></p><p>"But what if he succeeds?"</p><p></p><p>One of the imperial spirit kings spoke up, and the rest of the spirits trembled.</p><p></p><p>After a moment, the expressions of the imperial kings became resolute.</p><p></p><p>"If he succeeds, we must give him our full support."</p><p></p><p>"The lifelong missions of all the human emperors throughout history have been two: to fulfill the will left by our ancestors, and to guard the descendants of Xuanyuan.</p><p></p><p>We have waited for too long. Until our will has been eroded, and we no longer even care about protecting the human race.</p><p></p><p>If this child cannot pass the Ancestor's test, then we have no reason to continue managing the human race. We will just stay in this Imperial Spirit Stele and honestly wait for it to completely crumble, and we will perish along with it."</p><p></p><p>At this moment, the imperial spirit kings could feel Ye Xiao beginning to interact with the Imperial Spirit Stele.</p><p></p><p>He first used his soul power to touch the stele.</p><p></p><p>One second, two seconds, three seconds... dozens of seconds passed, and the spirits' minds also became somewhat frozen.</p><p></p><p>But in the end, Ye Xiao withdrew his soul power.</p><p></p><p>The imperial spirits sighed softly.</p><p></p><p>"Failed with the soul power? Failed?"</p><p></p><p>At this point, Ye Xiao did not get discouraged, but used his second type of power, the vital energy, to interact with the Imperial Spirit Stele.</p><p></p><p>Time passed second by second, and after dozens of seconds, the vital energy power also announced its failure.</p><p></p><p>At this point, the imperial kings had already given up any hope.</p><p></p><p>After all, the two best methods to accept the Imperial Spirit Stele's test were soul power and vital energy, and both of these superior methods had failed. The other methods basically had no great hope.</p><p></p><p>As expected, when Ye Xiao finally used his spiritual power and spiritual energy to touch the Imperial Spirit Stele, it also ended in failure.</p><p></p><p>"Ah, just a moment of false hope."</p><p></p><p>"I thought we had finally encountered the legendary Heavenly Mandate Son."</p><p></p><p>"What a pity, what a pity. To reach the Emperor Realm in just a year and a half, but in the end, it was still useless."</p><p></p><p>Ye Xiao naturally heard their words, but he did not give up.</p><p></p><p>Perhaps he could try using his divine soul.</p><p></p><p>The Golden Book divine soul had been supporting him all along. It was precisely because of the Golden Book divine soul that his power had become so powerful.</p><p></p><p>Its existence was extremely extraordinary, so perhaps it might have some method.</p><p></p><p>Here is the full English translation of the Chinese excerpt:</p><p></p><p>Thinking about this, Ye Xiao took a deep breath and immediately began to activate the divine soul in the Golden Book to communicate with the Imperial Spiritual Stele.</p><p></p><p>Originally, the imperial spirits within the Imperial Spiritual Stele had already given up hope, and some were even preparing to return to their original positions to hibernate.</p><p></p><p>However, at this moment, an unexpected event suddenly occurred.</p><p></p><p>The Imperial Spiritual Stele suddenly erupted with dazzling golden light, accompanied by a thunderous roar in the air, and the entire stele began to move violently.</p><p></p><p>In the void, streaks of golden light began to emerge and then condense, which were the divine blood of the Xuanyuan ancestors.</p><p></p><p>The emperors were immediately shocked, and those who were about to leave also stopped in their tracks and turned to look at this incredibly unbelievable scene.</p><p></p><p>"This... the Imperial Spiritual Stele has reacted!"</p><p></p><p>"Five thousand years! It's been five thousand years! The Imperial Spiritual Stele has finally reacted."</p><p></p><p>"Ancestors bless, the Mandate of Heaven's son of the Xuanyuan clan has finally appeared!"</p><p></p><p>Some of the imperial spirits had already started to excitedly shout, some had a faint glow in their eyes, and some even directly knelt down to pray to their ancestors.</p><p></p><p>The divine blood continued to gather and converge, and finally broke through the Imperial Spiritual Stele, pouring into Ye Xiao's body without end.</p><p></p><p>With the influx of this divine blood, Ye Xiao's power suddenly surged, his spiritual energy began to run wildly, constantly refining the divine blood and enhancing his own strength.</p><p></p><p>As the divine blood entered his body, thunderous roars began to emanate from within Ye Xiao.</p><p></p><p>This was the sound of his power rising, his flesh and soul becoming stronger!</p><p></p><p>A small bird flew over and silently landed on the shoulder of the cultivating Ye Xiao.</p><p></p><p>"Roar!"</p><p></p><p>Suddenly, an earth-shattering dragon's roar came from within Ye Xiao, instantly blasting the small bird into shreds without even leaving a trace of blood mist.</p><p></p><p>This dragon's roar signified the formation of another protective dragon qi within Ye Xiao.</p><p></p><p>It was refined from the vast celestial spiritual energy.</p><p></p><p>Wen Chou had once said that only by gathering a true one hundred and eight dragon qi would one have a chance to break through to that realm.</p><p></p><p>Ye Xiao previously only had one dragon qi, but unexpectedly, after obtaining the divine blood of the Xuanyuan ancestors, he had formed a second dragon qi! No, the dragon's roar did not stop there, there was a second, third, fourth, all the way to the seventh, forming seven protective dragon qi. Ye Xiao's dragon's roar finally came to a gradual stop.</p><p></p><p>At this point, combined with the one dragon qi he had formed when he entered the Emperorship, he now possessed a total of eight protective dragon qi.</p><p></p><p>This meant that Ye Xiao's strength had increased tremendously compared to before. After the divine blood was completely refined and absorbed by Ye Xiao, an additional cultivation technique also appeared on his Golden Book.</p><p></p><p>It was the divine art sealed within the Imperial Spiritual Stele that the emperors had spoken of - the Heavenly Splitting Sword Technique! It was actually complementary to the sword technique he had previously obtained, and it was not of the same origin as the divine art.</p><p></p><p>In other words, it could be combined with the Heavenly Opening Sword to form an existence even higher than a divine art.</p><p></p><p>Ye Xiao was overjoyed, not expecting to gain so much benefit from this trip to the Imperial Spiritual Stele.</p><p></p><p>His strength had greatly increased, his protective dragon qi had increased from one to eight, and he had also obtained a divine sword technique that could slay gods.</p><p></p><p>It was truly a windfall.</p><p></p><p>When he opened his eyes, he found that all the imperial spirits had already emerged from the Imperial Spiritual Stele, smiling at him.</p><p></p><p>"Senior predecessors?"</p><p></p><p>Ye Xiao was slightly puzzled.</p><p></p><p>A handsome emperor in armor armor smiled and said, "You have passed the test of the Imperial Spiritual Stele, and it is time for us to fulfill our promise."</p><p></p><p>Ye Xiao was overjoyed, but in the blink of an eye, he seemed to have thought of something and quickly spoke up, "What is the method to activate the dragon veins?"</p><p></p><p>The long-faced emperor spoke again, "To sever the dragon veins, one must cut off the dragon qi within them, for that is the foundation of the dragon veins. </p><p></p><p>Now to reactivate the dragon veins, naturally we need dragon qi to reactivate them. </p><p></p><p>Although we are just remnants of souls and have no real use, the dragon qi from our lifetimes still remains within our spiritual bodies."</p><p></p><p>Ye Xiao's pupils shrank, he had already figured it out - the method to activate the dragon veins was to let these predecessors sacrifice their own souls, completely turning their spiritual essence into dragon qi and merging it into the dragon veins, becoming their core and reactivating them.</p><p></p><p>But from now on, they would be reduced to ashes.</p><p></p><p>He was just about to speak up, when the next moment, a great emperor in a black and red dragon robe raised his hand and said, "Child, you don't need to say more, this is our own wish.</p><p></p><p>For thousands of years, we have been carrying out the will of our ancestors, protecting the human race while searching for the secret our ancestors told us to find.</p><p></p><p>But this time has been too long, to the point that we are exhausted, generation after generation unable to complete the task.</p><p></p><p>We have long since given up hope.</p><p></p><p>Today, it is you who has rekindled the hot blood in us as descendants of Xuanyuan!</p><p></p><p>You have shown us hope, so we will continue to guard this Nine Provinces!"</p>

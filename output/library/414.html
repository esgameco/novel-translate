        <h1>Chapter 414</h1>
        <div class="content">
            <p>Here is the full English translation of the Chinese excerpt:</p><p></p><p>Crack, crack, Ye Xiao directly tore open the chest of the Flame Dragon King, and took out all the divine blood within his body.</p><p></p><p>This extremely brutal method shocked the other beast lords, who couldn't help but hold their breath and didn't even dare to take a deep breath! How cruel!</p><p></p><p>That was a divine king, although he had just broken through the seal, and his cultivation had not yet fully recovered to its peak, but... this was too tragic.</p><p></p><p>He was just spoken to, and then directly torn apart by him.</p><p></p><p>In the future, they must never provoke him, as the divine king said, he would just tear them apart. If any of them provoked him and angered him one day, they would be torn apart alive, and they wouldn't even be able to cry about it.</p><p></p><p>Ye Xiao absorbed all of the Flame Dragon King's divine blood into his own body, and also absorbed the remaining divine blood residues from the two divine kings, which allowed him to break through the fifth layer of the Slaughter God Realm!</p><p></p><p>Feeling Ye Xiao's aura rise again, all the beast lords couldn't help but shiver.</p><p></p><p>This guy is getting stronger and stronger, and his cultivation speed is so fast.</p><p></p><p>At this rate, they feel that Ye Xiao might break through to the divine king realm in less than a year.</p><p></p><p>This is simply too crazy! You must know that this is breaking through to the divine king realm! Not just the divine realm, much less the small realms of the human race.</p><p></p><p>This is a divine king!</p><p></p><p>To put it bluntly, all the geniuses in the entire starry sky are just worthless trash in front of him!</p><p></p><p>Although they have never seen those so-called geniuses.</p><p></p><p>After a moment, Ye Xiao slowly opened his eyes, his divine eyes shining like the stars in the night sky.</p><p></p><p>The aura bursting forth was as sharp as a sword edge.</p><p></p><p>Although there was nothing he could do to these beast lords, they felt a painful sensation on their skin, as if it was about to tear open at any moment.</p><p></p><p>Terror was rapidly spreading, and the star beasts were shivering.</p><p></p><p>"Why do I smell a urine odor?" </p><p></p><p>Long Blood Tiger couldn't help but murmur, and Xuanming Wolf trembling said, "Senior, did you urinate on me?"</p><p></p><p>The claws of Long Blood Tiger twitched uncontrollably.</p><p></p><p>He didn't expect this to happen, it was too embarrassing.</p><p></p><p>At this time, Ye Xiao had already stood up and was preparing to walk out.</p><p></p><p>It was obvious that he didn't want to eat the meat of these beast lord-level star beasts today.</p><p></p><p>He had just absorbed a lot of divine blood, and there was still some residue that was being continuously refined.</p><p></p><p>If he ate too much at once, it would cause indigestion.</p><p></p><p>However, although he did not ask these star beasts for their star beast meat, these star beasts became more and more panicked.</p><p></p><p>Were they useless? Ye Xiao no longer had any feelings for them?</p><p></p><p>Oh my god, this was a dangerous signal.</p><p></p><p>Given the current situation, they might not last long before being directly slaughtered by Ye Xiao, possibly eaten or used to refine elixirs.</p><p></p><p>No matter which one it was, it would be a desperate situation for them.</p><p></p><p>When they first came in, they were actually unwilling to submit, but unfortunately, Ye Xiao didn't let them die at that time.</p><p></p><p>After getting over the initial desire to die, they now started to fear death.</p><p></p><p>This involved a very subtle psychological aspect.</p><p></p><p>So when they realized that they were no longer valued by Ye Xiao, and were very likely to be slaughtered by him later, they became fearful and began to desperately try to prove their value to Ye Xiao.</p><p></p><p>Big Fish was the first to step forward, he cut off one of his fish wings, and with the other fish wing, he offered the fish wing to Ye Xiao.</p><p></p><p>"Master, would you like to eat fish meat today? I have the best fish wings here, I've cut off the old ones, and this is a brand new, tender and juicy fish wing. Please accept it, as it represents my deep love and loyalty to you."</p><p></p><p>Xuanming Wolf also hurriedly offered a hind leg.</p><p></p><p>"Master, freshly cooked wolf hind leg! It's perfect for braising. The meat is tender and not dry, with scallions, ginger and garlic, braised in a big pot of oil, the aroma is irresistible. Take a bite, and I guarantee you'll want to chop off my other leg tomorrow morning."</p><p></p><p>Star beasts like Lan Xin Water Lily and Shrimp God also stepped forward, offering their most valuable star beast meat.</p><p></p><p>Seeing them all offering their meat, Long Blood Tiger fell into deep contemplation.</p><p></p><p>Everyone is offering meat, and there's so much meat, can Ye Xiao even finish it all!? If he's had enough, maybe he'll just kill them and refine them into elixirs.</p><p></p><p>Since he wants to highlight his own value, he should offer the most unique, most attractive, and most irreplaceable thing he has - himself.</p><p></p><p>Thinking of this, he lowered his head and looked towards his lower body.</p><p></p><p>They say that all men like to drink wine, and if the master wants to eat meat, he must also want to drink wine! What value is there in ordinary wine?</p><p></p><p>But if he uses this to make wine, it would be different.</p><p></p><p>It has benefits like nourishing yin, strengthening the foundation, replenishing essence and qi, and enhancing yang. </p><p></p><p>By offering this, as long as Ye Xiao still wants him to supply it in the future, he won't dare to slaughter him.</p><p></p><p>It's decided, this is the one!</p><p></p><p>Of course, Ye Xiao knew what these beast lords were thinking. They must be...</p><p></p><p>Here is my translation of the Chinese excerpt you provided:</p><p></p><p>I'm afraid of accidentally killing them, so I'm being so cautious right now, all of them are eagerly trying to provide me with resources, so that they can ensure they won't die.</p><p></p><p>In fact, I really don't have the intention to attack them at the moment, and today, I only wanted to give them a day off because there is too much divine blood within me, they are overthinking it.</p><p></p><p>However, just as I was about to refuse, Dragon Blood Tiger came limping towards me, a huge tiger paw holding a bloody and ragged object, trying hard to force out a smile.</p><p></p><p>"Master, take this to soak in wine and drink it. For men, soaking this in wine is very good for the body."</p><p></p><p>Ye Xiao: "(_..)!"</p><p></p><p>Lan Xin Shuixian: "（⊙.⊙）!"</p><p></p><p>Youming Wolf: "（⊙.⊙）!"</p><p></p><p>Xia Shen: "（⊙.⊙）!"</p><p></p><p>Big Fish: "Senior Dragon Blood Tiger, you are really ruthless!!"</p><p></p><p>Dragon Blood Tiger smiled:</p><p></p><p>"As long as I can contribute a little to my master, a few taels of meat is nothing, right?"</p><p></p><p>Ye Xiao silently accepted these things and said indifferently, "Although I don't know what you mean, since this is your heartfelt intention, I won't be polite and will accept it."</p><p></p><p>After saying that, Ye Xiao left the cellar, and the various spirit beasts all started raising their claws towards him.</p><p></p><p>"Dragon Blood Tiger, you are really impressive!"</p><p></p><p>"Senior, I'm really impressed by you. Being so ruthless to yourself, you will definitely succeed in the future! You will definitely achieve great things!"</p><p></p><p>Dragon Blood Tiger smiled.</p><p></p><p>"You're too kind, too kind. After all, it can grow back, you don't need to worry about me. You should think more about yourselves.</p><p></p><p>After all, I'm one of a kind, I should be fine, but I can't guarantee the same for you!"</p><p></p><p>The spirit beasts: "(˙灬˙)!"</p><p></p><p>Ye Xiao returned to his courtyard, processed the spirit beast meat, and soaked the wine. Dragon Blood Tiger's few taels of meat quickly released its blood energy in the wine, and soon the entire jar of wine was filled with vital energy.</p><p></p><p>Just then, a knocking sound came from the main gate.</p><p></p><p>"Hello, is anyone home? We are from the defense team, here to inquire about some matters."</p><p></p><p>Ye Xiao was somewhat surprised.</p><p></p><p>"That voice, isn't that Fatty? Why did he come here?"</p><p></p><p>He went to the door and opened it, and sure enough, it was Gu Hai.</p><p></p><p>Gu Hai was also very surprised.</p><p></p><p>"Ah, Old Ye, so this is your home."</p><p></p><p>Ye Xiao nodded.</p><p></p><p>"Why are you all out on a mission so late at night?"</p><p></p><p>"Don't mention it, the Ning family manor was hit by thieves, our defense team had to come out for night patrol, searching the entire city, just in case anything unexpected happens."</p><p></p><p>"I see, well come on in and have a seat, I'll pour you some tea."</p><p></p><p>"Okay. Guys, this is my good brother's home, let's go in and have some water, then continue the search."</p><p></p><p>The others nodded and followed Gu Hai into Ye Xiao's courtyard.</p><p></p><p>As soon as they entered, they all felt the dense spiritual energy in this small courtyard, vastly different from the outside.</p><p></p><p>"Whew! Hai-ge's friend here, he doesn't seem ordinary at all!"</p><p></p><p>"That's right, this small courtyard, while it doesn't look like much, actually has such dense spiritual energy. Just based on this spiritual gathering ability, he must be at least a peak Xiantian cultivator!"</p><p></p><p>"Peak Xiantian? That's an understatement! Looking at this, he's likely already a Grand Master, if not even beyond that!"</p><p></p><p>"Whoa! So Hai-ge's friend here is actually a powerhouse approaching Grand Master level? Or he may even already be a Grand Master?"</p><p></p><p>"Probably about that level."</p><p></p><p>"Hai-ge really is full of surprises, being able to be good friends with such a high-level cultivator. Even if it means I have to shave 10 years off my life, I'd still want a Grand Master friend like him!"</p><p></p><p>"Hah, dream on! You? With your looks? A Grand Master friend? That's something only those who have accumulated merits from their ancestors can get. You're lucky if you can even have a Master as a father-in-law."</p><p></p><p>"..."</p><p></p><p>The group walked into Ye Xiao's living room, and Ye Xiao pointed towards the teapot.</p><p></p><p>"Fatty, pour yourselves as much as you want, the tea leaves are right there."</p><p></p><p>"Hehe, then I won't be polite!" </p><p></p><p>Gu Hai poured himself a few cups of tea and took a sip, immediately feeling refreshed and energized.</p><p></p><p>"Wow, this spiritual energy tea is really amazing? It's beyond my expectations."</p><p></p><p>"If you like it, you can take some back for Meng Meng to try as well, it's good for children."</p><p></p><p>"Okay. Oh right, Ye Xiao, you'll need to be more careful lately, there have been some strange occurrences around the outskirts of Jianghai City."</p>

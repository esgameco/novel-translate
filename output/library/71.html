        <h1>Chapter 71</h1>
        <div class="content">
            <p>Here is the full English translation of the Chinese excerpt:</p><p></p><p>"Those stinky men, how can they compare to you, brother Ye Xiao? With your face, you don't even know how many men you can leave behind." </p><p></p><p>Wang Na also stretched out her feet, and through the stockings, the blue nail polish on her toes was clearly visible.</p><p></p><p>Indeed, those who paint such bright and unconventional nail polish usually have a more open-minded personality.</p><p></p><p>Ye Xiao remembered that there was a description of this in a certain classic masterpiece.</p><p></p><p>Was it Certain Xiang? Or Certain Bai? Unfortunately, Ye Xiao had already quietly and imperceptibly finished reading the book, so Wang Na didn't catch him, and Ye Xiao closed the book and stood up.</p><p></p><p>He put the book he was holding back on the bookshelf.</p><p></p><p>"Sister Wang, sometimes, letting go is a kind of liberation."</p><p></p><p>With that, Ye Xiao turned and left, leaving Sister Wang standing there dumbfounded.</p><p></p><p>Everyone in the library knew that Wang Na was unrestrained and uninhibited, but only a few elders knew that when she first came to the library, she was still a naive girl full of beautiful aspirations for life.</p><p></p><p>In the past, because she had not awakened her spiritual soul, after graduating from the Martial Arts Academy, she could only take a non-martial arts job in society.</p><p></p><p>But her boyfriend had awakened his spiritual soul, and he was very handsome and had exceptional talent.</p><p></p><p>In order to give her boyfriend a better future, she used all the money she earned from her job to support him to study and practice martial arts at the Central State Martial Arts Academy.</p><p></p><p>It is said that at that time, she didn't even have enough money to buy a piece of clothing.</p><p></p><p>In the end, her boyfriend succeeded, and joined one of the top-tier private military companies in the country, the Ant Hiring Group.</p><p></p><p>But he only gave her a breakup text message.</p><p></p><p>From then on, she fell into depravity.</p><p></p><p>There are very few people who are born bad, and very few women who are born promiscuous.</p><p></p><p>Sometimes, it's just that there are too many scumbags out there.</p><p></p><p>After learning all the basic techniques of the body method system, Ye Xiao only needed to wait for the last technique to be automatically cultivated to the great perfection by the golden book's spiritual soul, and then he could synthesize it.</p><p></p><p>If nothing unexpected happens, he can synthesize it tonight.</p><p></p><p>At that time, what level will his speed reach?</p><p></p><p>He was really looking forward to it.</p><p></p><p>At the City Lord's Mansion, two red flag H9s silently drove in.</p><p></p><p>This time, City Lord Du Tianyue did not arrange any grand welcoming ceremony, he just waited inside the mansion.</p><p></p><p>But unlike the last time when Mr. Zhao came, this time, he personally went to open the door.</p><p></p><p>"Uncle."</p><p></p><p>After opening the door, he slightly bowed and addressed him as "uncle".</p><p></p><p>The person getting out of the car was none other than Du Changfeng.</p><p></p><p>He patted Du Tianyue's shoulder, with a look of relief on his face.</p><p></p><p>"You've done well with the affairs of Jianghai City this time."</p><p></p><p>The expression on Du Tianyue's face became even more respectful and humble.</p><p></p><p>"It's all thanks to your education, uncle."</p><p></p><p>Du Changfeng chuckled and headed towards the conference room, with Du Tianyue following closely behind.</p><p></p><p>"There's no need to be so modest. This time, I was transferred from the Jingdu Martial Arts Academy and ordered to return to Jianghai City to assist you in city planning.</p><p></p><p>One reason is to prevent the emergence of another fool like the one surnamed Zhao. </p><p>The other reason is to prevent you from inadvertently offending those major powers, which could bring about your downfall."</p><p></p><p>Du Tianyue's face lit up with joy.</p><p></p><p>"With uncle guarding Jianghai City, there's definitely no problem."</p><p></p><p>"It's not that simple. Although I am a major power, there are many mysterious and powerful experts in the Nine Provinces, stronger than me. You still need to behave properly and not disregard the rules.</p><p></p><p>As long as you have the well-being of the people of Jianghai City in mind and maintain righteousness, everything will be fine."</p><p></p><p>Here is my translation of the Chinese excerpt:</p><p></p><p>"The protection from these two great masters is not as strong as your own cultivation. Your own spiritual attainment is more powerful."</p><p></p><p>"Yes!"</p><p></p><p>Seeing the serious expression on Dou Tiany端's face, Dou Changfeng continued:</p><p></p><p>"I'm not trying to scare you. In the past few days, a large-scale joint operation has been organized on the border between Zhongzhou and Chuzhou, deploying several great masters and masters, as well as hundreds of post-celestial warriors. Their target is the Beast God Cult that has been developing for many years in the vast Wanjiang Mountains. </p><p></p><p>Although the assembled military force is very strong, Zhongzhou and Chuzhou have still predicted that they will suffer a 50% or even two-thirds casualty rate. After all, the Beast God Cult is too powerful and too mysterious. The experts within it are countless, and those who call themselves the controllers of the Beast Gods possess bloodlines of sub-dragon level spirit beasts, with strengths that have broken through to the early Celestial Venerable realm for many years! But guess what? </p><p></p><p>A sword beam came from nowhere and directly blasted the entire Beast God Cult into the sky."</p><p></p><p>"Is this true?"</p><p></p><p>Dou Tiany端's expression changed immediately.</p><p></p><p>"Yes. This matter is too big, so it was suppressed by the higher-ups immediately, not allowing anyone to speak of it, otherwise the news media all over the country would have exploded. </p><p></p><p>However, this is not a rare occurrence. Our Jiuzhou is blessed with talented people, with countless hidden masters in the mountains and wilderness. </p><p></p><p>In the past two hundred years, the various barbarians and ruffians have always wanted to undermine the strength of Jiuzhou. From the Eight States Alliance Army of the past to the later guidance of the spirit beasts to invade, whenever Jiuzhou was in crisis, haven't hidden masters come forward to lend a hand? But Jiuzhou has ultimately borne too much, resulting in the loss of many precious strong ones, and many precious martial arts have been interrupted as a result.</p><p></p><p>If not for this, do you think Pu Jiansheng could have swept away the sword dao talents of the same age in Jingzhou? Isn't it because many families' sword dao experts fell while guarding the national gate, leading to insufficient inheritance? Martial arts cannot be learned just by reading books; without the personal guidance of senior masters, many realms are always difficult to understand."</p><p></p><p>Dou Tiany端 nodded.</p><p></p><p>"That's true. If someone could become strong just by reading books without any guidance, then he would not be a real person."</p><p></p><p>"The reason why Jiuzhou wants to gather some small cities is also because of this. By centralizing the educational conditions and concentrating the martial arts experience of excellent teachers, it can comprehensively promote the overall strength of each region.</p><p></p><p>The competition between countries is becoming increasingly fierce now. With the United States as the leader, the genetic martial arts and technological martial arts are developing more and more vigorously. If the martial arts level of Jiuzhou is not restored to the truly world-leading level it once had, once these barbarians possess absolute strength, it will be a disaster for Jiuzhou.</p><p></p><p>Those who are not of our kind, their hearts must be different!"</p><p></p><p>"In the current situation of the star battlefield, do they still want to break the peace between the human race?"</p><p></p><p>"Peace? That's just a beautiful word used to deceive people. In recent years, in the star battlefield, the human race has never stopped fighting each other, apart from fighting the spirit beasts!</p><p></p><p>However, Jiuzhou will surely have the last laugh! Because we have the strongest martial arts bloodline in the world, the most intelligent wisdom, and the hardest backbone!</p><p></p><p>Even if it takes a long time, even if the difficulties are many, the barbarians will not be able to withstand the determination and pace of Jiuzhou's resurgence!"</p><p></p><p>Dou Tiany端's heart trembled, his gaze firm and unwavering.</p><p></p><p>This nation, tempered by a thousand trials, even if it walks alone in solitude, will still stand tall at the pinnacle of the world!</p>

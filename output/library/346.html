        <h1>Chapter 346</h1>
        <div class="content">
            <p>Here is my translation of the Chinese excerpt you provided:</p><p></p><p>After the Xuanyuan Clan descended to the mortal world, household appliances could no longer be used, so Ye Xiao had thrown them all into the storage room.</p><p></p><p>"What are you getting that thing out for now?" </p><p></p><p>Huan Liuli chuckled.</p><p></p><p>"I just bought some discs, so of course I have to find the TV to watch them."</p><p></p><p>"But do you have any electricity?"</p><p></p><p>"Of course! I conveniently bought a hand-cranked generator."</p><p></p><p>Ye Xiao was rather speechless.</p><p></p><p>"Do you really have to watch that TV show?"</p><p></p><p>"Of course! It's a show I've always wanted to watch, but never had the chance. Now that I finally have the opportunity, I can't give it up!"</p><p></p><p>Ye Xiao shook his head. </p><p></p><p>"Do whatever you want, just don't make too much noise and disturb my meditation."</p><p></p><p>"Understood."</p><p></p><p>Ye Xiao went into his room to begin meditating. </p><p></p><p>Huan Liuli then started fiddling with her TV.</p><p></p><p>Soon, she had used the hand-cranked generator to power on the TV that had been gathering dust for over two years.</p><p></p><p>Huan Liuli: "!"</p><p></p><p>"After waiting all these years, I can finally continue watching this TV series. Mighty factory boss, come out!"</p><p></p><p>On the other side, Ye Xiao returned to his own room to continue cultivating. </p><p></p><p>At this moment, he suddenly discovered a strange thing - as his cultivation progressed, the dragon qi within him was no longer increasing.</p><p></p><p>Or more accurately, the spiritual energy he was absorbing was no longer increasing either. </p><p></p><p>It was as if it had reached a state of saturation, and no matter how he tried to improve, he could not reach a higher level.</p><p></p><p>Ye Xiao's brow furrowed.</p><p></p><p>"This situation seems a bit off. Even when I reached the peak of the King Realm, the half-step Emperor Realm, and exceeded my limits, I was still able to continue improving my strength.</p><p></p><p>But now I can no longer continue improving, does this mean there are limits to the Emperor Realm?"</p><p></p><p>After pondering for a moment, Ye Xiao tried another method.</p><p></p><p>He attempted to refine the dragon qi to temper his divine soul.</p><p></p><p>Sure enough, when the dragon qi began to refine the divine soul, there was finally movement within Ye Xiao.</p><p></p><p>The originally thick dragon qi, at this moment, seemed to have found an outlet, and began to frantically and continuously pour into the Golden Book divine soul.</p><p></p><p>After being nourished by this dragon qi, Ye Xiao found that the Golden Book had also begun to undergo new changes.</p><p></p><p>It had grown larger! That's right, it had grown larger, and was continuing to grow larger without limit.</p><p></p><p>Originally it was about the size of a book, but in the end, it had grown to almost the same size as Ye Xiao's own body.</p><p></p><p>And Ye Xiao's 108 protective dragon qi had disappeared completely, not a trace remaining.</p><p></p><p>Ye Xiao couldn't help but be taken aback.</p><p></p><p>That's it?</p><p></p><p>In just a few seconds?</p><p></p><p>It just grew a bit larger? No other special effects occurred? Or did it jump around a bit? It just absorbed one dragon qi and that was it? Well, this divine soul really had Ye Xiao stumped.</p><p></p><p>However, at this moment, he suddenly discovered that he could continue cultivating again.</p><p></p><p>The only difference was that while he could continue to absorb spiritual energy into his dantian, he was no longer able to form new protective dragon qi.</p><p></p><p>"How strange. That's all there was to it? No other reactions? Could it be that the so-called spiritual energy tempering of the divine soul is actually just refining the divine soul to a level close to the physical body?</p><p></p><p>Then what's next? Fusing the divine soul and physical body together? But how exactly do you fuse them together?"</p><p></p><p>Ye Xiao once again fell into confusion.</p><p></p><p>According to common sense, since the divine soul is called a divine soul, it must have a great relationship with the divine realm body.</p><p></p><p>Even at the King Realm, the human flesh and soul had already fused into one, without distinction between soul and body, only separating at the time of death to remove the soul from the physical body.</p><p></p><p>The reason for this was most likely to provide a strong enough vessel for the divine soul, so that when reaching the Divine Realm, the divine soul and divine realm body could be merged.</p><p></p><p>But now, after his divine soul had absorbed 108 protective dragon qi, there were no signs of it wanting to merge.</p><p></p><p>Could it be that his physical body was still not strong enough? Ye Xiao felt that he really needed to find a divine realm inheritance or manual to study.</p><p></p><p>He must find a way to understand the difference between the divine soul and physical body.</p><p></p><p>Time flew by, and the next morning, Ye Xiao came downstairs to see Huan Liuli sitting on the sofa, hugging her knees and looking dazed, her eyes red and swollen, as if she had been crying for a long time.</p><p></p><p>"What's wrong with you?"</p><p></p><p>Ye Xiao asked, quite puzzled.</p><p></p><p>Huan Liuli looked up at him, then began to sob softly.</p><p></p><p>"Wah, Cao Zhengchun, also known as Cao Eunuch Dog... Wah, I've always idolized him and used 'I' when talking, but it turns out he was a man who was treated that way. I'm so embarrassed after all these years."</p><p></p><p>Ye Xiao said sympathetically:</p><p></p><p>"I already told you not to watch that TV show, but..."</p><p></p><p>Here is the full English translation of the Chinese excerpt:</p><p></p><p>"If you insist on going, now you know the pain, don't you?" </p><p></p><p>"Master, I hate that eunuch Cao dog to death." Ye Xiao patted her little head. This silly cat has also experienced a lot of misfortune. In her early years, she followed the Star Beast Army to the mortal world, and then hid for decades.</p><p></p><p>During these decades, she hid here and there, and no one even taught her how to survive. She could only rely on stealing things to live.</p><p></p><p>If it weren't for meeting me, and I was very weak at the time, wanting a star pet, she might not even be alive now.</p><p></p><p>"Forget the past, focus on cultivating well in the future."</p><p></p><p>Huan Liuli solemnly nodded and said gratefully, "Master, you are so good, you didn't even laugh at me."</p><p></p><p>Ye Xiao: "(_..)!" </p><p></p><p>He had never found it funny, he just thought Huan Liuli was a bit silly.</p><p></p><p>"I have to go out and be busy, you enter the Transmission Jade Seal, eat more star beasts, and supplement your own strength.</p><p></p><p>Now there are experts everywhere outside, your strength is not enough, and you are likely to be beaten to death if you go out in the future."</p><p></p><p>"Understood."</p><p></p><p>Huan Liuli obediently entered the jade seal to improve her own strength, while Ye Xiao returned to the library.</p><p></p><p>In this way, the days passed peacefully for about a week. The peaceful life began to be gradually broken.</p><p></p><p>Ye Xiao clearly felt that many Empyrean experts had left Jianghai City.</p><p></p><p>Although he did not go out, he could still feel the direction in which those Empyrean experts had left, which was towards the starry sky.</p><p></p><p>Even the librarian had left.</p><p></p><p>Ye Xiao vaguely felt that something must have happened in the starry sky. But now that the XuanYuan Clan has taken charge, he doesn't need to worry too much.</p><p></p><p>The XuanYuan Clan has many powerful experts, there is no shortage of masters, unlike before when the Nine Provinces encountered any trouble, it was difficult to find a helper besides him.</p><p></p><p>With the librarian gone, Ye Xiao also had more free time.</p><p></p><p>He used the Thought Stone to communicate with Jing Di.</p><p></p><p>"Calling Senior Jing Di."</p><p></p><p>The face of Senior Jing Di soon appeared on the Thought Stone, and he looked a bit younger than before, perhaps due to the increase in his strength.</p><p></p><p>"What's the matter?"</p><p></p><p>"I have some things I want to ask you about, do you have time?"</p><p></p><p>"No problem, just go ahead."</p><p></p><p>"I want to know, since our human race ancestors were Godly Monarch experts, they were so powerful, did they leave any inheritance or something? Did they only leave behind the Empyrean Stele?"</p><p></p><p>"There is, but our ancestor once said that if your cultivation hasn't reached the peak of the Empyrean Realm, you can't enter it.</p><p></p><p>In the past, there were many Empyrean experts who wanted to go in and try, but in the end they all failed. Some were even injured or even perished.</p><p></p><p>That's why we didn't tell you about this before."</p><p></p><p>"Can you take me there to take a look?"</p><p></p><p>"Didn't I just tell you? That place is very dangerous, you must reach the peak of the Empyrean Realm before you have a chance... you... you..."</p><p></p><p>Jing Di suddenly seemed to have discovered something, and his tone started to tremble.</p><p></p><p>"Ye Xiao, you don't mean you've already reached that level, right? Don't joke with me.</p><p></p><p>It's only been two years! Two years ago, your cultivation was only at the Sixteenth Dragon of the Empyrean Realm, and that was after absorbing the divine blood that you snatched from Lin Qingbei, the most powerful cultivator in the world. Are you telling me you've already reached the peak of the Empyrean Realm now?"</p><p></p><p>Ye Xiao smiled slightly.</p><p></p><p>"If it's convenient, let's talk about it in person. It's hard to explain clearly with this thing."</p><p></p><p>"Okay, okay, I'll come over right away. Wait for me in Jianghai City, I'll go ask the Elder for a leave."</p><p></p><p>Ten minutes later, Jing Di arrived in front of Ye Xiao, and Blue Dragon had also come with him.</p><p></p><p>"Senior Blue Dragon, why did you come as well? Aren't you supposed to be with the Lingming Sect, not with Senior Jing Di?"</p><p></p><p>Blue Dragon explained:</p><p></p><p>"Recently, the XuanYuan Clan and the other three major clans seem to have some friction in the starry sky, and all the old Empyrean experts have gone there. I got some free time, so I went to visit Senior Jing Di.</p><p></p><p>But I didn't expect to hear your news, so I came with Senior Jing Di."</p><p></p><p>Jing Di, without bothering to catch up with Ye Xiao, eagerly asked:</p><p></p><p>"Ye Xiao, is it true that you've really reached that level?"</p><p></p><p>Ye Xiao nodded.</p><p></p><p>"The Hundred and Eight Dragons of the Empyrean Realm?"</p><p></p><p>Ye Xiao nodded again.</p><p></p><p>Jing Di took a deep breath several times, his excitement overflowing.</p><p></p><p>As for Blue Dragon, he didn't have much of a reaction.</p><p></p><p>He had already been shocked by Ye Xiao's genius time and time again.</p><p></p><p>At this moment, even if Ye Xiao had reached the Godly Monarch Realm, Blue Dragon wouldn't find it too strange.</p><p></p><p>[This is the end of the second update, 6,000 words.

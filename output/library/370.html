        <h1>Chapter 370</h1>
        <div class="content">
            <p>Here is the full English translation of the Chinese excerpt:</p><p></p><p>Ye Xiao was completely dumbfounded.</p><p></p><p>This foolish cat's efficiency in handling things was actually so high? In that instant, he even began to doubt his own life and his previous judgment of Huan Liuli.</p><p></p><p>Could it be that this foolish cat had actually been acting all along? But Ye Xiao's sharp intellect quickly figured out the reason.</p><p></p><p>The other party was already injured, and it's possible that the foolish cat just happened to encounter him and then persuaded him over.</p><p></p><p>This explanation was the most reasonable.</p><p></p><p>In the courtyard, the Big Fish looked at the building and couldn't help but feel puzzled.</p><p></p><p>"Do you all really live in this dilapidated place? This small house is not even as big as the kitchen of my true body! You all are super beast and half-step divine beast existences, how come you're living so miserably?"</p><p></p><p>Huan Liuli chuckled.</p><p></p><p>"It doesn't matter, that's not important. You can also treat this place as our kitchen."</p><p></p><p>Big Fish: "?"</p><p></p><p>Just as he was still puzzled and confused, Ye Xiao walked out of the room.</p><p></p><p>The moment he saw Ye Xiao, he couldn't help but have his pupils contract.</p><p></p><p>"Human race?! Wait a minute, this is..."</p><p></p><p>He already vaguely felt that something was not quite right around here.</p><p></p><p>A chill instantly shot up from his fish tail to his fish head.</p><p></p><p>"Damn it! I've been tricked!"</p><p></p><p>Without the slightest hesitation, he immediately tried to unleash his movement technique to escape.</p><p></p><p>But unfortunately, he was already seriously injured, and he couldn't even exert one-tenth of his strength. Let alone escape in front of Ye Xiao, an existence at the inverted heaven level. As soon as he tried to activate his movement technique, the next moment, Ye Xiao activated the Annihilation River, directly restraining his body and the entire surrounding area.</p><p></p><p>The Extermination Treasure Art was activated, with its powerful might directly slicing his body into dozens of pieces.</p><p></p><p>The poor Big Fish, his consciousness instantly plunged into a sea of darkness.</p><p></p><p>A deep sense of resentment and indignation filled his soul!</p><p></p><p>He was so angry! Why? Why in this day and age, even the star beasts had to betray their own kind and become running dogs for the human race.</p><p></p><p>Why? What was the reason behind all this? He really wanted to ask, but he could no longer get the answer.</p><p></p><p>After struggling so hard to reach this point, he didn't even die in the hands of the Ancestral Dragon, yet now he died at the hands of a few small fry.</p><p></p><p>How humiliating! Big Fish couldn't understand all of this.</p><p></p><p>As for Huan Liuli and the other star beasts, after seeing Ye Xiao's techniques, they immediately started flattering him.</p><p></p><p>Huan Liuli: "Master's divine abilities are unparalleled!"</p><p></p><p>Great Emperor Dragon Lion: "Master is a god descended from the heavens!"</p><p></p><p>Earth King Dragon: "Master will reign supreme for generations, unifying the starry skies. Master is the greatest, Master is the most handsome, Master is the most outstanding! Master is the eternal god in my heart! Master, I will serve you for ten thousand years."</p><p></p><p>Sea Sky Wings: "(⊙.⊙)!" </p><p></p><p>She had no more words to say, as the star beasts' culture was not very high, and she only had a few words in her stomach, but in the blink of an eye, she was completely overshadowed by the Earth King Dragon, not even leaving a single sentence for herself. This damned snake was really ruthless! Fortunately, Ye Xiao didn't pay much attention to it, and he smiled and praised, "You all have worked hard, and you all did very well this time."</p><p></p><p>"Thank you, Master."</p><p></p><p>Huan Liuli couldn't help but speak up:</p><p></p><p>"Master, master, this fish is so big and fat! The taste must be very good. Let's just eat him up now! Should we do red-braised or steamed? Stewing is also fine, with some pepper and garlic sprinkled on top, the freshness will be unbeatable!"</p><p></p><p>Ye Xiao walked up to the fish.</p><p></p><p>"Let me first take a look at what kind of fish this is. Not all fish are suitable for stewing."</p><p></p><p>However, when he approached the fish and took a closer look, his eyes immediately lit up.</p><p></p><p>"Wow! It's actually this kind of fish!"</p><p></p><p>Huan Liuli and the other star beasts were a bit puzzled.</p><p></p><p>"Master, what kind of fish is it?"</p><p></p><p>Ye Xiao patiently explained:</p><p></p><p>"This fish is a salmon. Its meat is very tender and delicious, and it's an excellent choice for sashimi."</p><p></p><p>Huan Liuli and the others' eyes lit up.</p><p></p><p>"Sashimi? So we can eat it raw."</p><p></p><p>Ye Xiao nodded.</p><p></p><p>"There's wasabi and soy sauce in the kitchen. Go get them."</p><p></p><p>"Okay!"</p><p></p><p>Huan Liuli quickly slipped into the kitchen and quickly brought out the soy sauce and wasabi.</p><p></p><p>Ye Xiao used his spiritual energy to form a sword qi, cutting off a small piece of meat, dipping it in soy sauce, and then putting it into Huan Liuli's little mouth.</p><p></p><p>"How is it?"</p><p></p><p>Huan Liuli took a bite and immediately exclaimed excitedly, "It's so delicious! This fish is really good! I love eating this fish. The fat and lean are just right, and it's not greasy at all!"</p><p></p><p>Ye Xiao nodded.</p><p></p><p>"That's why I said this fish is best eaten raw."</p><p></p><p>He took out four pieces of meat and handed them to Huan Liuli.</p><p></p><p>"These four pieces of meat are for you all."</p><p></p><p>The three-headed Great Emperor Dragon Lion star beasts were completely dumbfounded.</p><p></p><p>"We also get a share?"</p><p></p><p>Ye Xiao nodded and continued preparing another piece of fish meat to eat.</p><p></p><p>"Of course you all get a share. It was you all who brought him here in the first place. You all have made a great contribution, so I naturally have to reward you."</p><p></p><p>Huan Liuli distributed the three pieces of fish meat to each of the star beasts. The three star beasts looked at the star beast meat in their hands, not knowing what to do? Suddenly, they felt their eyes starting to sting.</p><p></p><p>Here is my translation of the Chinese excerpt you provided:</p><p></p><p>This feeling of being cared for and treated well is truly wonderful!</p><p></p><p>In the past, they never understood one thing - why was Huan Liuli willing to obediently follow Ye Xiao's commands and become his star pet? Now they seem to understand.</p><p></p><p>It's because star beasts lack love. From the moment they are born, each star beast has to walk on the edge of knives and through seas of fire, never able to stop, or else they will die. This is the cruel law of natural selection.</p><p></p><p>But with Ye Xiao, they experienced this feeling of being loved for the first time. </p><p></p><p>This feeling is truly wonderful! They really want to become Ye Xiao's star pets, just like the true star pet Huan Liuli.</p><p></p><p>They've decided that from now on, they will work even harder to serve their master, striving to earn his recognition, so that one day they too may have the qualifications to become his star pets.</p><p></p><p>On Ye Xiao's side, after devouring a large fish's worth of star beast meat, the blood energy in his body began to surge noticeably. In the blink of an eye, his cultivation had broken through to the third realm of the Divine Realm!</p><p></p><p>Wow, if he had tried to cultivate this on his own, it would have taken at least another month to break through to the third Divine Realm. But after replenishing a certain amount of blood energy, his cultivation had advanced this quickly. </p><p></p><p>It seems that in addition to one's own diligent cultivation, eating and drinking well is also important.</p><p></p><p>He has decided that from now on, he must capture even more Sovereign-level star beasts.</p><p></p><p>After eating and drinking their fill, Huan Liuli's cultivation also made a breakthrough, directly reaching the middle stage of the Divine Beast realm. After all, she was a Sovereign-level beast - the blood energy contained within her was truly immense.</p><p></p><p>The other star beasts had also increased in power to varying degrees, but not as much as Huan Liuli, because her lower initial cultivation allowed her to advance faster, while the higher-level ones increased more slowly.</p><p></p><p>"Have you all eaten and drunk your fill?" Ye Xiao asked.</p><p></p><p>The star beasts all nodded.</p><p></p><p>"Then let's get back to work! Now that we've captured a Sovereign-level star beast, you should continue mining."</p><p></p><p>"Yes! We will complete the task!" The star beasts resolutely and confidently burrowed back underground.</p><p></p><p>Now they were brimming with enthusiasm, eager to serve Ye Xiao.</p><p></p><p>Ye Xiao looked at the three salmon heads on the ground, the corners of his mouth curling up slightly. He did not store them in his jade token, as that was currently being used to store spirit crystals underground. Instead, he chose to bring the salmon heads to the cellar beneath his courtyard.</p><p></p><p>This cellar had originally been flattened by Ye Xiao when he set up the star beast breeding ground beneath the library. Later, as Ye Xiao felt he was harvesting too much star beast meat every day and wanted to prevent others from discovering it, he had re-excavated this cellar.</p><p></p><p>Since the jade token was currently occupied, he might as well use the cellar to store the large fish. He quickly brought the fish heads inside and began to use his healing arts to revive them.</p><p></p><p>In the darkness, the fish's soul was drifting, and it had already prepared to let go of its unwillingness and resentment.</p><p></p><p>It had no other choice, for it was already dead. Even if it wanted to seek revenge, even if it still couldn't understand, it was still dead! Since it was already dead, what was the point of dwelling on these issues? Wouldn't that just be tormenting itself?</p><p></p><p>Fine, let it end here. From now on, it would accompany this endless darkness, allowing its soul to wander aimlessly in this world of death forever.</p><p></p><p>At this moment, it couldn't help but admire its own magnanimous character, feeling that perhaps not many could match it.</p><p></p><p>It felt it should be revered by future generations, praised by posterity. However, just then, it suddenly noticed a small glimmer of light in the distance.</p><p></p><p>What a warm glow! It was like the feeling of seeing the light for the first time when it first emerged from its mother's belly.</p><p></p><p>So dazzling, so shocking.</p><p></p><p>At this moment, the fish could not control its own body, swaying its tail and swimming towards that point of light.</p><p></p><p>It could not control its own nature, opening its mouth and taking a bite.</p><p></p><p>Ah!</p><p></p><p>The next moment, it suddenly felt the environment around it change.</p><p></p><p>The fish: "?"</p><p></p><p>The surroundings were still as dark as before, but with one difference - it was not as dark as just now.</p><p></p><p>And there was another difference - the human who had just slain it was now appearing before it again.</p><p></p><p>"Is this Sovereign dreaming?"</p><p></p><p>Ye Xiao shook his head and smiled faintly. "Welcome to the star beast breeding ground. From today onwards, you will be my fish. See this cellar? I dug this cellar for you. It will also be your home from now on.</p><p></p><p>Your job is to provide me with blood and flesh. Come on, I have high hopes for you."</p>

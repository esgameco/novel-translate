        <h1>Chapter 107</h1>
        <div class="content">
            <p>Here is the full English translation of the Chinese excerpt:</p><p></p><p>"With this armor combined with the Indestructible Divine Skill, I estimate that King Aer can no longer break through my defenses. Next, I need to enhance my combat power.</p><p></p><p>I have already grasped the true meaning of the Innate Sixth-Grade Martial Dao. As long as my spiritual energy cultivation reaches the required level, I can break through to the Innate Sixth-Grade realm at any time.</p><p></p><p>Last night, I ate some black-scaled snake meat, which contained a lot of vital energy. My spiritual energy cultivation has increased significantly.</p><p></p><p>If I can refine the black-scaled snake into a medicinal pill through alchemy, I should be able to quickly reach the Innate Sixth-Grade realm!"</p><p></p><p>With this determination, Ye Xiao tidied up and prepared to go to work.</p><p></p><p>The leftover black-scaled snake scales had been forged into more than twenty throwing knives by him.</p><p></p><p>As usual, Ye Xiao bought breakfast, ate it while walking, and stopped by Old Boss Xu's shop on the way to work.</p><p></p><p>"Old Boss Xu, come out and receive the goods."</p><p></p><p>"Alright."</p><p></p><p>Old Boss Xu came out with a smile.</p><p></p><p>"What are you selling this time?"</p><p></p><p>Ye Xiao took out a cloth bag and handed all the throwing knives to Old Boss Xu.</p><p></p><p>"Here, I found some more yesterday, and it turns out to be a full set, not just a few. Do you want to buy them?"</p><p></p><p>Old Boss Xu: "(Speechless)!"</p><p></p><p>After a long silence, Old Boss Xu spoke again.</p><p></p><p>"Little Ye, be honest with me. Are these things your family heirlooms, or did you dig them out of some tomb?</p><p>I'm telling you, I don't deal with shady stuff. If the origin is unclear, both of us could end up in the garrison prison."</p><p></p><p>"Don't worry, if I had dug these out of a tomb, I wouldn't have sold them all to just you."</p><p></p><p>"That makes sense."</p><p></p><p>As mature adults, if Ye Xiao's items were of questionable origin, he wouldn't dare to just hand them over to Old Boss Xu.</p><p></p><p>"Alright, I'll transfer the money to you."</p><p></p><p>Ye Xiao nodded, and after Old Boss Xu transferred the money, he smiled and said:</p><p></p><p>"Little Ye, how are you considering the matter I mentioned the other day?"</p><p></p><p>"What matter?"</p><p></p><p>"The one about you and my daughter."</p><p></p><p>Ye Xiao: "(Speechless)!"</p><p></p><p>"Old Boss Xu, I really don't want to date anyone right now."</p><p></p><p>"Well, do you have any colleagues or good friends who want to date? You can introduce them to me. Don't worry, I won't treat you badly. If you help me find a match, I'll give you a 40% discount on materials in the future."</p><p></p><p>"I'll try my best to find someone."</p><p></p><p>"Alright, I'll wait for your good news."</p><p></p><p>"Mm."</p><p></p><p>When Ye Xiao arrived at the library and just sat down to read, he heard some readers discussing nearby.</p><p></p><p>"He's here, he's here. Ashura Ninja Sword Sect's Village Akira, ranked 50th on the World Dragon Ranking, has spoken up. He's coming to challenge the peerless swordsman in our Jianghai City, to clear his disciple's name."</p><p></p><p>"I knew he would come sooner or later. His own disciple was slashed, of course he wouldn't let it go."</p><p></p><p>"Now, our Jianghai City is really lively. First, it was Sword Saint Liu Chengxun from Hanzhou, and now Ashura Ninja Sword Village Akira from Yingzhou, both ranked in the top 50 on the World Dragon Ranking. If they attack us ordinary people, won't we be in danger?"</p><p></p><p>"You're overthinking it. There are only 100 people on the World Dragon Ranking, and these two are only barely in the top 50. Our Jiuzhou already has 17 experts in the top 50!</p><p></p><p>Even the Sword Emperor Blue Dragon, ranked number one in the world, is from Jiuzhou.</p><p></p><p>If they dare to act recklessly, the Jiuzhou Alliance will definitely send out the Dragon Ranking experts to deal with them."</p><p></p><p>Here is the full English translation of the Chinese excerpt:</p><p></p><p>The experts are monitoring the situation throughout. If they dare to cause trouble, unless they are tired of living! The reason they dare to come is because they are simply challenging our two peerless experts in Jianghai City. As long as they don't harm the innocent, the two of them will naturally be fine.</p><p></p><p>"That makes sense."</p><p></p><p>Hearing these words, Ye Xiao couldn't help but shake his head.</p><p></p><p>It's one wave after another!</p><p></p><p>Previously, the issue with Liu Chengxun had not been resolved, and now there's another one, Cun Shang Bichuan.</p><p></p><p>The strength of both of them is at the Divine Sect level, and they should be a bit stronger than Aer Wang, right?</p><p></p><p>After all, in the Legend Under the Starry Sky written by Yang Zhengyi, Aer Wang's strength is at the Divine Sect First Realm.</p><p></p><p>As for Liu Chengxun and Cun Shang Bichuan, even among the Divine Sect experts worldwide, they can barely make it into the top fifty, so they are indeed formidable.</p><p></p><p>However, he is not too worried.</p><p></p><p>First, he never intended to show himself, so he won't accept their challenge and let them wait somewhere.</p><p></p><p>After all, with the experts of the Nine Provinces present, they wouldn't dare to be too reckless.</p><p></p><p>Secondly, if his identity is exposed and he is forced to fight them, it wouldn't be a problem.</p><p></p><p>The Seven Stars Convergence is approaching, and they won't be able to come now.</p><p></p><p>Han State and Ying State also need to defend against the Star Beasts.</p><p></p><p>The two of them are most likely to come after the Seven Stars Convergence.</p><p></p><p>Before the Seven Stars Convergence, his cultivation should be able to reach a sufficient level, and he should have a high chance of successfully refining the Elixir.</p><p></p><p>After the Seven Stars Convergence, using Aer Wang to refine the Elixir, he should be able to concoct some powerful medicinal pills.</p><p></p><p>He's not sure if he can reach the Divine Sect realm, but he should reach a level very close to it.</p><p></p><p>With his ability to fight beyond his level, defeating them shouldn't be a big problem.</p><p></p><p>Of course, if possible, he would prefer not to take action.</p><p></p><p>If he defeats the two of them, whose rankings are 47th and 50th on the World Dragon Ranking, he may not just be noticed by the people of Jianghai City and some netizens.</p><p></p><p>At that time, his existence might be noticed by the entire world.</p><p></p><p>This is not a good thing for Ye Xiao, who wants to live a low-profile life.</p><p></p><p>Meanwhile, in the Jianghai City Martial Arts Academy, Qin Yuyan finished practicing her sword techniques in the Martial Arts Hall, and she received a burst of enthusiastic applause.</p><p></p><p>"Well done!"</p><p></p><p>Everyone cheered, and Qin Yuyan bowed in acknowledgment.</p><p></p><p>She had already passed the written part of the teacher qualification exam for the Jianghai Martial Arts University, and now she was facing the martial arts interview, which was a test of her martial arts attainments.</p><p></p><p>In fact, with her martial arts attainments, whether she passed the exam or not would be the same, as she had already defeated Sasaki Taro, and her level was sufficient to be specially recruited as a teacher at the academy.</p><p></p><p>But she still had to go through the process, as it was a matter of face.</p><p></p><p>Qin Shenglong smiled and said, "Yuyan, your performance today was perfect. In the next two days, I'll get your information ready and start arranging your class, so you can start teaching."</p><p></p><p>Qin Yuyan nodded.</p><p></p><p>"Thank you, Grandpa."</p><p></p><p>"Oh, by the way, your Second Uncle has also returned to Jianghai City these days. I heard he encountered a big trouble before, so you should go visit him first. Tonight, we'll have a family dinner together."</p><p></p><p>(This chapter is complete)</p>

        <div class="content">
            <p>Here is the full English translation of the Chinese excerpt:</p><p></p><p>After hanging up the phone, Ye Xiao opened a web page to check the news outside, and his expression became much more serious.</p><p></p><p>It turned out that in addition to a few cities in Jianghai, many other cities had also been attacked by the star beasts.</p><p></p><p>It seems that this is the same as the result he found from searching the memories of that star messenger.</p><p></p><p>The star beasts are coveting the entire human race, not just a few cities.</p><p></p><p>It seems that the human race will have a lot of trouble in the next few days.</p><p></p><p>Many forums are also saying that there are many short videos on some short video software, some of which are complaining, some of which are filming human warriors fighting on the star beast battlefield, and a few are even self-mocking and joking.</p><p></p><p>However, the news that Ye Xiao cares most about is not the low-level star beasts, even if there are countless of them, he can easily deal with them by releasing a few thousand knives and tens of thousands of swords, which is completely trivial to him.</p><p></p><p>What really worries Ye Xiao the most is the news that some cities have escaped the divine ancestor star beasts.</p><p></p><p>The memory of the previous holy messenger also mentioned that during this seven-star conjunction, the star beasts will carry out large-scale massacres of the human race, using the blood to unseal those divine ancestor experts.</p><p></p><p>This is the real great threat.</p><p></p><p>These divine ancestor-level experts have huge destructive power and extremely strong mobility, and are very difficult to deal with.</p><p></p><p>Ye Xiao has no doubt that in the future, they will bring great disasters to the human race and pave the way for the beast disaster four years later.</p><p></p><p>Thinking about it, it's really helpless, the Nine States have been trapped, and they have to use these divine ancestor star beasts as array points to enhance the spiritual energy of the cities. At the same time, they also bear a huge risk.</p><p></p><p>After all, the human race in this world is too disunited.</p><p></p><p>Especially those barbarians, they are really stupid.</p><p></p><p>The human race is facing the great enemy of the star beasts, and the crisis is already imminent, but they still want to do some unsavory actions here, which is really dirty and unspeakable.</p><p></p><p>Ye Xiao then looked at some international news.</p><p></p><p>A laboratory in the American State, using star beasts for experiments, took advantage of the seven-star conjunction to greatly increase their strength and rebelled, causing the deaths of tens of thousands of warriors, including some high-end scientists.</p><p></p><p>Currently, the star beasts have collectively fled into the mountains and are being searched for.</p><p></p><p>A strange incident occurred in the Ying State, the Yin-Yang Family, An Bei Yin Yu, under the temptation of the star beasts, released a large number of sealed evil divine ancestor star beast experts, causing incalculable casualties of warriors.</p><p></p><p>California, Australia, England... a series of places have also experienced a large number of star beast escapes.</p><p></p><p>Somehow, Ye Xiao's mood suddenly improved a lot, and he even felt a bit inexplicably amused.</p><p></p><p>Soon, Ye Xiao turned off his phone and began to ponder his next course of action.</p><p></p><p>At the moment, just with this seven-star conjunction, the human race in the world is already overwhelmed. If the star battlefield cannot withstand it and the defense line is breached, allowing the star beasts to be released, the beast disaster will descend, and the casualties are unimaginable.</p><p></p><p>Ai'er Wang is already very strong, but in this seven-star conjunction, he is not the strongest star beast.</p><p></p><p>In the beast disaster, he will probably be even more insignificant.</p><p></p><p>The future is unknown how many stronger star beasts there will be, and his own strength is still too weak, he needs to further improve it.</p><p></p><p>Speaking of which, he can now use Ai'er Wang to improve himself.</p><p></p><p>Relying solely on eating roasted mutton skewers to improve is definitely not enough.</p><p></p><p>Ai'er Wang has many uses, and he needs to do it step by step.</p><p></p><p>First, the star core.</p><p></p><p>The star core is the core part of a star beast, containing the essence of the star beast, and is the best choice for refining elixirs.</p><p></p><p>Ye Xiao estimates that by refining Ai'er Wang's star core into an elixir, his own cultivation will increase by a not insignificant amount, not necessarily breaking through to the pre-Heaven eighth rank, but increasing his current strength by two or three percent should be no problem.</p><p></p><p>However, before refining the star core into an elixir, it also has a very important use, which is to analyze the innate cultivation technique belonging to the star beast within it.</p><p></p><p>Many basic cultivation techniques and imperial techniques of humans are obtained in this way.</p><p></p><p>Not all star beast star cores can obtain cultivation techniques, on the one hand because of the bloodline of the star core, and on the other hand because of the strength of the analyzer's spiritual power.</p><p></p><p>In his case, he is exceptionally gifted.</p><p></p><p>First, Ai'er Wang's star core, without a doubt, has a dragon-level bloodline.</p><p></p><p>Secondly, he has cultivated the Taixuan Tiangong, and his spiritual power is so strong that there is no need to doubt it.</p><p></p><p>Like the previous Black Scale Snake, because its bloodline was not that strong, he did not analyze its star core, but directly refined it into an elixir and consumed it.</p><p></p><p>Ye Xiao immediately used the Taixuan Tiangong to analyze Ai'er Wang's star core.</p><p></p><p>Ten minutes later, the corner of his mouth slightly curled up.</p><p></p><p>Sure enough, it succeeded! Extreme Healing Technique! The special ability of Ai'er Wang to constantly revive himself has formed this cultivation technique.</p><p></p><p>It is also an imperial technique, and it is another healing system technique different from the Supplementing the Heavens Technique and the Chenxing Technique, which was directly absorbed into the Golden Book Shen Hun and began to cultivate.</p><p></p><p>He hit the jackpot, and it's a huge windfall.</p><p></p><p>Previously, Ye Xiao's Supplementing the Heavens Technique and Chenxing Technique had already begun to faintly emit a golden light. If he can cultivate the Extreme Healing Technique to the great perfection realm, he should be able to fuse the imperial techniques, right? He is really looking forward to what kind of cultivation technique will appear after the fusion of the imperial techniques.</p><p></p><p>The imperial techniques are already powerful enough to defy the heavens, and the cultivation technique after the fusion will be even more terrifying.</p><p></p><p>Here is the full English translation of the Chinese excerpt:</p><p></p><p>It is necessary to overturn the sky and completely press it down beneath oneself. </p><p></p><p>Just the thought of it is exhilarating.</p><p></p><p>After analyzing it, the function of the star core has been reduced to being thrown into the storage ring, waiting to be refined.</p><p></p><p>In fact, the imperial art of King Aer is far more than just an ultimate healing art, but his other imperial arts are not inherent in his bloodline, but were later realized by himself, not existing within the bloodline, only in his memories. His soul is not much different from his own, and he cannot search his soul, so he can only kill him, and therefore cannot obtain his other imperial arts.</p><p></p><p>It can be considered that in the future, when one becomes more powerful, one can go and scan the imperial arts of some divine sect masters.</p><p></p><p>But for the time being, one can also consider exterminating some star beasts with dragon-level bloodlines to see if there are any imperial arts.</p><p></p><p>Thinking of this, Ye Xiao looked up and saw Huan Liuli sweeping the courtyard.</p><p></p><p>Huan Liuli also has a dragon-level bloodline, so maybe there are some imperial arts in her star core as well?</p><p></p><p>But soon, Ye Xiao shook his head and abandoned this idea. </p><p></p><p>The silly cat, although silly, is still very obedient. Why would one want to harm such an obedient pet? Sweeping the yard, Huan Liuli suddenly sensed something strange, shivered, and then looked up at the second-floor window with a puzzled expression.</p><p></p><p>"Strange, just now I felt like I was being watched."</p><p></p><p>Upstairs, Ye Xiao continued to study King Aer. </p><p></p><p>This time it was King Aer's horns.</p><p></p><p>King Aer's horns are extremely hard, much harder than the so-called alloy steel knives or meteorite iron on Earth.</p><p></p><p>These two horns, if used to forge a weapon, would absolutely be top-notch, and the combat enhancement of the weapon would be incredibly powerful.</p><p></p><p>Ye Xiao immediately began to display his divine craftsmanship, refining these two horns.</p><p></p><p>He used the essence extracted from the two horns to forge a weapon.</p><p></p><p>What weapon should he forge? </p><p></p><p>Since he is proficient in both saber and sword techniques, he might as well refine a Tang dynasty saber.</p><p></p><p>The Tang saber is highly practical, can be used like a saber, and can also be used like a single-edged sword.</p><p></p><p>On Yingzhou, the small sabers and swords copied from the Tang saber have been passed down from ancient times to the present day, and are renowned worldwide.</p><p></p><p>Needless to say, the design of the Tang saber is unparalleled, with no predecessor and no successor.</p><p></p><p>Ye Xiao spent a full day and night forging a slender, seven-foot-long saber.</p><p></p><p>Seeing the faint gleam of cold light on the blade, one could estimate that its destructive power would be extraordinary.</p><p></p><p>However, Ye Xiao is not so foolish now, and will not casually go out and test it. Otherwise, he would stir up a big sensation again.</p><p></p><p>In the future, when he encounters a divine sect master, he can try its power then.</p><p></p><p>After refining the Tang saber, the weapon has already begun to slowly rotate around Ye Xiao and emit a series of faint sword cries, which is the mark of an imperial weapon, indicating that it has developed self-awareness.</p><p></p><p>And judging from its intelligence, it is a quite remarkable imperial weapon.</p><p></p><p>Ye Xiao was very satisfied, and made another profit.</p><p></p><p>He took off his black python skin coat, wanting to try the sharpness of the Tang saber a little, without infusing any spiritual energy, so there would not be any major disturbance.</p><p></p><p>The black python armor is also an imperial weapon, so it can definitely test the standard of the Tang saber.</p><p></p><p>Ye Xiao did not say much nonsense, and directly slashed the coat with the saber.</p><p></p><p>Whoosh! Seeing the large hole in the coat, Ye Xiao fell into deep contemplation.</p><p></p><p>After all, the old is still the spicy, the black python is indeed no match for King Aer.</p><p></p><p>But he has nothing to be sad about, after all, the black python armor can self-repair.</p><p></p><p>In comparison, the performance of the Tang saber has made Ye Xiao particularly satisfied and amazed. Its sharpness is so extraordinary, and its combat enhancement must be very powerful.</p><p></p><p>Such a good sword, if it doesn't have a nice name, it would be a shame.</p><p></p><p>What should he call it?</p><p></p><p>King Aer's horn? Too old-fashioned!</p><p></p><p>Deicide Saber? </p><p></p><p>Too chuuni.</p><p></p><p>The Ultimate Imperial Emperor's Asura Bloodthirsty Annihilation Blade?</p><p></p><p>Too embarrassing.</p><p></p><p>Forget it, it seems he and the Gold Book Spiritual Cultivator are both bad at naming things. He'll just go online and search for a name later.</p><p></p><p>The mighty netizens must have a good name, right?</p><p></p><p>Putting the long saber back into the storage ring, Ye Xiao began to take out King Aer's hide.</p><p></p><p>The big sheepskin feels so warm. If it were the hide of an ordinary star beast, he could make an undershirt or something, and mom wouldn't have to worry about his body in the winter anymore.</p><p></p><p>But this is the hide of King Aer, a divine sect master, extremely tough, of course it will be used to refine armor.</p><p></p><p>It has to be said, King Aer the sheep is truly full of treasures! The star core can be refined into imperial arts, and it can also be used for alchemy.</p><p></p><p>The physical body and blood qi are rich, making it delicious for barbecue, and can also increase a bit of one's cultivation.</p><p></p><p>The bones can be boiled into soup, and the bone marrow can also be refined.</p><p></p><p>The horns have been forged into an imperial saber, and now the hide can be refined into an armor! It's a sheep of a hundred uses, King Aer is a sheep of a thousand uses! One word: amazing!</p><p></p><p>(This chapter ends)</p>

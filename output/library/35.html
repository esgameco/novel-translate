        <h1>Chapter 35</h1>
        <div class="content">
            <p>Here is the full English translation of the Chinese excerpt:</p><p></p><p>Personnel manager Yang Zhengyi assigned some work to a few people.</p><p></p><p>After receiving their new work badges, the group prepared to return to their respective posts, but Ye Xiao was called over by Yang Zhengyi.</p><p></p><p>"Little Ye, wait a moment."</p><p></p><p>Ye Xiao stopped, and the others, including Wang Jie, left first.</p><p></p><p>Manager Yang smiled and said, "Little Ye, last time your neighboring colleague was transferred away, leaving you to handle two large areas on your own. This time, a new person has joined, and I've allocated one for you to help ease the pressure a bit."</p><p></p><p>Ye Xiao nodded.</p><p></p><p>"Thank you, manager."</p><p></p><p>"Don't mention it. You've done the best job in our library, your area is the cleanest, and the books are the most neatly organized. Keep up the good work, I have high hopes for you."</p><p></p><p>Ye Xiao nodded again and then left the personnel department.</p><p></p><p>When he arrived at the area, he found a young man in jeans sitting rather awkwardly on a chair. Seeing Ye Xiao approach, he immediately stood up.</p><p></p><p>"H-hello, Manager Ye, I'm Ning Yuheng, the new administrator. Please take care of me."</p><p></p><p>Ye Xiao responded with a light "Mm."</p><p></p><p>"Sit, don't be nervous."</p><p></p><p>"Oh, okay."</p><p></p><p>Ning Yuheng sat back down. His skin was very tender, even more so than many girls.</p><p></p><p>Perhaps due to his shyness, his cheeks had a slight blush, making him look... well, a bit bewitching.</p><p></p><p>Ye Xiao glanced at him briefly but didn't linger.</p><p></p><p>However, Ye Xiao's Taixuan Tiangong had already thoroughly examined him from head to toe, 360 degrees.</p><p></p><p>This young man was actually a post-celestial fifth-grade cultivator. </p><p></p><p>Given his bone age, he should be around 18 years old.</p><p></p><p>To have broken through to the post-celestial fifth grade at this age was no ordinary feat. </p><p></p><p>A true genius!</p><p></p><p>Such a talented individual, instead of continuing to be cultivated in an academy or sent to the frontlines, had ended up here as a small administrator in the library. </p><p></p><p>How interesting.</p><p></p><p>Clearing his throat, Ye Xiao spoke in a calm tone:</p><p></p><p>"The administrator's work is very simple. Clock in and out on time, be responsible for organizing the books, and report any damaged books. Also, clean up before leaving in the afternoon. Other than that, you can read books and do your own things.</p><p></p><p>But don't make any noise, the library requires silence."</p><p></p><p>"Understood!"</p><p></p><p>"Since you just started today, first take a look at where the books are located, so you'll know where to find them when someone borrows a book."</p><p></p><p>"Yes, sir!"</p><p></p><p>Ning Yuheng responded and immediately began surveying the books.</p><p></p><p>Ye Xiao then sat back down to continue reading.</p><p></p><p>Previously, he had only managed two areas - his own and the area of his former neighboring colleague who had left.</p><p></p><p>Now, as the manager, Ye Xiao was responsible for four areas, with two more added.</p><p></p><p>He could read even more books now.</p><p></p><p>This felt much more comfortable to him than a raise in salary.</p><p></p><p>The incomplete cultivation techniques in the golden book were numerous - body techniques, cultivation methods, fist techniques, palm techniques, forging skills, star formations, alchemy, and more than he could count.</p><p></p><p>There was still so much for him to learn and cultivate.</p><p></p><p>After reading for just a few minutes, Ye Xiao couldn't help but furrow his brow slightly.</p><p></p><p>There was something 'foreign' that had infiltrated the area.</p><p></p><p>It was a spiritual entity, similar to the evil ghost he had previously slain.</p><p></p><p>Here is the full English translation of the Chinese excerpt:</p><p></p><p>The spiritual body was just like a human's, as they were all the souls of the deceased.</p><p></p><p>However, the aura surrounding this spiritual body was a bit off.</p><p></p><p>It was similar to the aura of a beast spirit.</p><p></p><p>A tiger spirit?</p><p></p><p>If it entered in spiritual form, unless one was a grand master or an exorcist who had cultivated mental techniques, it would be difficult to detect its presence.</p><p></p><p>In fact, this tiger spirit's level was quite high, and even an exorcist who had cultivated mental techniques might not be able to easily discover it if their cultivation was not profound enough.</p><p></p><p>Unfortunately, while it could evade detection by others, it could not escape the gaze of Ye Xiao.</p><p></p><p>After the mental techniques had fused into the Grand Celestial Divine Might, Ye Xiao's spiritual sense and mental power had become dual perception abilities! And they were of an extremely powerful level!</p><p></p><p>At the same level or even a higher level, they might not be able to match his perceptive abilities.</p><p></p><p>To put it bluntly, some people had stuffed things in places they shouldn't have, and he could clearly sense the type, shape, and vibration frequency without even needing to look.</p><p></p><p>From 800 meters away, he could stand there and know everything in detail! But Ye Xiao remained silent, continuing to read his book.</p><p></p><p>He wanted to see what this tiger spirit had come to the library for.</p><p></p><p>Soon, a colorless and formless spiritual body slowly floated into the third-floor window of the library.</p><p></p><p>With hands clasped behind his back, the ghostly aura around him formed a black robe, appearing ominous and mysterious.</p><p></p><p>"So this is the library of Jianghai City? The defensive forces are nothing more than this. In the face of this Venerable One, they are completely illusory and not worth mentioning at all!"</p><p></p><p>He floated into the library, suspending himself in the air and sweeping his gaze over the crowd, with a pair of flickering emerald-green flames in the ghostly aura - his eyes.</p><p></p><p>"The map left behind by King Aer should be on the top floor of the Jianghai City library.</p><p></p><p>The top floor has a star formation specifically designed to defend against spiritual bodies, so I'll have to attach myself to a physical form to go get the map.</p><p></p><p>Whose body should I attach myself to?"</p><p></p><p>The flickering emerald-green flames scanned over the people, first landing on Ye Xiao.</p><p></p><p>"This kid is a manager, but his cultivation is trash, only at the Posterior Heaven Second Grade. This level of cultivation can't even pass through the electromagnetic gravity barrier on the top floor.</p><p></p><p>Useless!"</p><p></p><p>Shaking his head, he turned his gaze to the next target.</p><p></p><p>"Posterior Heaven Third Grade, but already old, with depleted vital energy and osteoporosis, unfit for the task."</p><p></p><p>"Posterior Heaven Third Grade, with venereal disease, hmph, how filthy! To attach myself to such a woman's body would be to defile this Venerable One's spiritual body."</p><p></p><p>"Ah, this kid is not bad! At such a young age, he's already at Posterior Heaven Fifth Grade. Decided, it will be you!"</p><p></p><p>The emerald-green flames flickered, and the tiger spirit approached Ning Yutian's body, preparing to possess it.</p><p></p><p>Ning Yutian, who was checking the books, suddenly shuddered, and all the hairs on his body stood on end.</p><p></p><p>He couldn't see the spiritual body, but the approaching sense of death, the innate sixth sense of a living being, caused his body to tremble involuntarily.</p><p></p><p>However! Just as his heart was about to sink into despair, the feeling of death instantly vanished!</p><p></p><p>It took him a while to regain his composure, only then realizing that his clothes were soaked with sweat.</p><p></p><p>He even almost peed his pants.</p><p></p><p>He glanced towards the distance, and Ye Xiao was still bent over his book, with nothing around him.</p>

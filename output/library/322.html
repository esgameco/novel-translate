        <h1>Chapter 322</h1>
        <div class="content">
            <p>Here is the full English translation of the Chinese excerpt:</p><p></p><p>Ye Xiao no longer spoke.</p><p></p><p>In his heart, he felt a little guilty, not expecting the method to revive the Dragon Vein to be so cruel.</p><p></p><p>To make these emperors and strong figures who had devoted their entire lives to the Nine Provinces completely exhaust their last bit of spiritual power and disappear from this world forever.</p><p></p><p>But on the other hand, he couldn't help but admire these Emperors Realm experts! It was because of their steadfastness and support that the descendants of Xuanyuan were able to come this far.</p><p></p><p>"Esteemed seniors, I have a question I want to ask about the mystery of our ancestors. I've also heard the Tyrant King mention it, but I still don't know what it is.</p><p></p><p>Can the seniors tell me what it is exactly?"</p><p></p><p>The various emperors glanced at each other, and one stunningly beautiful and extremely majestic woman spoke:</p><p></p><p>"Regarding this question, we're not too clear about it either.</p><p></p><p>From the remaining ancestral legacy, we can learn that our ancestor was just an ordinary member of the Xuanyuan Clan. He sought to enhance his own strength and gain more support from the Xuanyuan Clan, so he traveled extensively in the starry sky.</p><p></p><p>Eventually, he found a mystery in this world and discovered benefits that even the Clan would covet.</p><p></p><p>In other words, if one can decipher this mystery, even a Clan member might gain tremendous enhancement.</p><p></p><p>Our ancestor said that if the mystery could be successfully analyzed, the descendants of Xuanyuan would have a chance to roam the starry sky.</p><p></p><p>Otherwise, even if they went to the starry sky, they would only be cannon fodder for the strong."</p><p></p><p>"Well, is there any hint about this mystery? At least there should be a name, right? You can't just let me search aimlessly like finding a needle in the ocean, can you?"</p><p></p><p>"There is a clue about that. Our ancestor's legacy once mentioned that it is related to the Ancestor of the Ten Thousand Dragons - the Kunlun Dragon Vein. But the Kunlun Dragon Vein has disappeared for many years, and we don't know where it is now, let alone what is inside the Kunlun Dragon Vein.</p><p></p><p>This is all we know. The rest is up to you to explore."</p><p></p><p>Ye Xiao nodded, and the next moment, an old Emperors Realm expert with white hair stepped forward.</p><p></p><p>"Alright, since we've told Ye Xiao everything, we should do what we should do. I'll go first."</p><p></p><p>"Emperor Xiaowen Holiness Liu Che! Today I transform into a dragon to protect my Nine Provinces!"</p><p></p><p>"Emperor Taizong the Great Saint, the Broad and Filial Emperor Li Shimin! Today I transform into a dragon to protect my Nine Provinces!"</p><p></p><p>"The Supremely Benevolent, Righteous, Saintly, Virtuous, Civil and Military, Sagacious, Brilliant, Broad and Filial Emperor Zhao Kuangyin! Today I transform into a dragon to protect my Nine Provinces!"</p><p></p><p>"Empress Wuzetian the Great Saint! Today I transform into a dragon to protect my Nine Provinces!"</p><p></p><p>"Haha, Mei Niang, I'm coming. Emperor Gaozong the Great Saint, the Broad and Filial Emperor Li Zhi! Today I transform into a dragon to protect my Nine Provinces!"</p><p></p><p>"Li Wuyong, even in death you're still holding a woman's shoes, truly embarrassing the face of us Xuanyuan men! Emperor Taizu the Great Saint, the Initiator of the Heavenly Mandate, the Founder, the Supreme Sage, the Supremely Benevolent, Civil and Military, Talented and Virtuous, Accomplished and Meritorious Emperor Zhu Yuanzhang! Today I transform into a dragon to protect my Nine Provinces!"</p><p></p><p>One emperor after another, who had written glorious pages in human history, at this moment, all transformed their spiritual bodies into dragon qi, flying into the dragon veins across the Nine Provinces.</p><p></p><p>Listening to those cries one after another, Ye Xiao felt deeply moved.</p><p></p><p>They had fought against the Star Beasts for the Nine Provinces with their heart and blood in life.</p><p></p><p>Now, they have completely destroyed their own spiritual bodies, turning into dragon qi to activate the dragon veins of the Nine Provinces, once again guarding the Nine Provinces.</p><p></p><p>This self-sacrifice touched people's hearts.</p><p></p><p>Just like the profound truths they had spoken in life.</p><p></p><p>"Those who offend the divine might of the Nine Provinces, though far, will be punished!"</p><p></p><p>"By my bedside, how can others snore!"</p><p></p><p>"Expel the Star Beasts, protect my Nine Provinces!"</p><p></p><p>They not only said it, but also did it, and they were doing it until the end.</p><p></p><p>One dragon vein after another on the Nine Provinces was lit up, and the dragon roars echoed through the Nine Provinces.</p><p></p><p>In this situation where the entire world had been invaded by the Star Beasts, the sky above the Nine Provinces surprisingly displayed an auspicious color.</p><p></p><p>This scene greatly inspired countless people of the Nine Provinces, making their blood boil.</p><p></p><p>The Azure Dragon guarding the Long White Dragon Vein looked up at the auspicious signs in the sky, feeling the dragon veins of the Nine Provinces constantly reviving, and the spiritual energy constantly increasing. He couldn't help but reveal an incredulous expression.</p><p></p><p>"The dragon veins of the Nine Provinces have revived? Could it be that Ye Xiao did this? What exactly did this child do?"</p><p></p><p>The Vermilion Bird Zhu Que in the Hu City had just slain a divine beast, when in the next moment, he saw several golden lights entering the ground of Hu City. After a thunderous dragon roar, a mighty spiritual energy began to gather towards Hu City endlessly.</p><p></p><p>Zhu Que opened his beautiful eyes wide, his gaze filled with a shocked expression.</p><p></p><p>"This power, this is the Dragon Vein? The Dragon Vein has revived?"</p><p></p><p>Since hundreds of years ago, the dragon veins of the Nine Provinces had been severed, leaving only the Long White Dragon Vein. But now, the dragon vein of Hu City had actually revived. This was simply too amazing!</p><p></p><p>A few dragon qi also descended on the Central State City, and Jiang Chen and the two old men, North Tang Ce, felt the dragon vein forming, their eyes reddening with excitement, their vision blurring with tears.</p><p></p><p>"It succeeded! Ye Xiao really..."</p><p></p><p>Here is the full English translation of the Chinese excerpt:</p><p></p><p>"It's done!"</p><p></p><p>"This child is truly the lucky star bestowed upon the Nine Provinces!"</p><p></p><p>"With this, the hope of the Nine Provinces' longevity is secured."</p><p></p><p>After all the dragon veins were fully revived, a massive dragon began to roar across the skies of the Nine Provinces.</p><p></p><p>It was the Great Wall Formation left behind by the ancestral dragon of the First Emperor! A formation specifically designed to guard the Nine Provinces and protect it from the threat of the Star Beasts.</p><p></p><p>Ye Xiao could feel the power within the Great Wall Formation - it was unassailable in its might! Its scope had far surpassed the realm of imperial formations; Ye Xiao dared to assert that this formation had reached the level of a divine formation.</p><p></p><p>The First Emperor truly deserved his reputation! The First Emperor of the past was the unparalleled emperor in the history of the Nine Provinces. He unified the land, standardized the carriages and scripts, and completely consolidated the powerful experts of the Nine Provinces.</p><p></p><p>This incarnation of the First Emperor was equally extraordinary beyond reason.</p><p></p><p>There were many powerful experts in the Imperial Realm of the Nine Provinces, but only he had created such a formidable formation.</p><p></p><p>Furthermore, the other powerful experts of the Imperial Realm had all perished, with only the ancestral dragon reaching the Stellar Realm, and it was unknown whether he was still alive.</p><p></p><p>If he was still alive, Ye Xiao didn't know if he would have the chance to meet this supreme expert in person and witness his true might.</p><p></p><p>At this moment, Ye Xiao also noticed the surging powerful auras emerging from the West.</p><p></p><p>His gaze couldn't help but sweep towards the West, his eyes filled with gravity.</p><p></p><p>One Transcendent Aura! Two Transcendent Auras!</p><p></p><p>Three Transcendent Auras! Four Transcendent Auras!</p><p></p><p>Wave after wave of Transcendent Auras were spreading out, as they had already refined the divine blood of the human race and were now embarking on frenzied breakthroughs.</p><p></p><p>Ye Xiao didn't know how many Transcendent Experts comparable to the Imperial Realm would ultimately emerge.</p><p></p><p>But he knew that no matter how many Transcendent Experts arrived, he had to defend the gates of the Nine Provinces. Only by guarding the gates could the human race of the Nine Provinces avoid being slaughtered.</p><p></p><p>Otherwise, these hundred-plus billion compatriots would all become the sustenance of the Star Beasts.</p><p></p><p>As the Star Beasts continued to break through to the Transcendent Realm, they began to converge towards the Nine Provinces.</p><p></p><p>Their ultimate target was the Nine Provinces! In fact, some areas had already come under attack from the Star Beasts.</p><p></p><p>But with the Great Wall Formation guarding them, the Star Beasts were completely unable to encroach, all of them firmly blocked outside the Great Wall.</p><p></p><p>The massive dragon guarding the Nine Provinces circled in the sky, disdaining all the invading Star Beast enemies, not giving them the slightest attention.</p><p></p><p>However, they would soon discover and find the gates of the Nine Provinces.</p><p></p><p>Invoking the Yin-Yang Escape Technique, Ye Xiao instantly appeared at the gates of the Nine Provinces.</p><p></p><p>This was the central point between the dragon's head and tail, the only entrance into the Nine Provinces.</p><p></p><p>Sword Sovereign Qinglong, Fiery Saber Zhuque, and several other venerable ones, as well as Lu Qingshan, Li Liushui, and Bei Tang Ce - the nine known powerful experts of the Nine Provinces - had all gathered here.</p><p></p><p>Seeing the solitary figure standing guard at the gates, they couldn't help but have their spirits stirred.</p><p></p><p>That child was only twenty-one years old.</p><p></p><p>Yet he bore the hopes of the entire Nine Provinces, guarding the gates of the Nine Provinces.</p><p></p><p>What immense power was contained within that slender frame to allow him to reach this point? At this moment, Ye Xiao, like the Imperial Realm experts who had once dedicated themselves to the Nine Provinces, was a figure worthy of praise and admiration! They approached Ye Xiao and couldn't help but speak:</p><p></p><p>"Ye Xiao, you have activated the Great Wall Formation! We will stand guard at this gate together."</p><p></p><p>Ye Xiao shook his head.</p><p></p><p>"You all should withdraw. I alone am sufficient here."</p><p></p><p>"Ye Xiao, with us here, we can still be of some help to you."</p><p></p><p>Ye Xiao raised his brows slightly and spoke again:</p><p></p><p>"No need. With you all here, it will be dangerous."</p><p></p><p>"But you alone have to face all the Star Beasts in the world. We cannot let you do this alone, even if it puts us in danger."</p><p></p><p>Before Bei Tang Ce could say more, Qinglong suddenly spoke:</p><p></p><p>"Let's withdraw. He's right, our presence here will only hinder his performance."</p><p></p><p>He had already discerned that Ye Xiao's cultivation had advanced even further.</p><p></p><p>When he was at Ye Xiao's home previously, Ye Xiao had just broken through a dragon qi, so he could still somewhat sense Ye Xiao's cultivation information.</p><p></p><p>But now, he felt as if a haze had shrouded his vision when looking at Ye Xiao, unable to see clearly.</p><p></p><p>This could only mean one thing - Ye Xiao had grown stronger!</p><p></p><p>In just a few days' time, Ye Xiao had once again surpassed his own cultivation and reached an even higher breakthrough.</p><p></p><p>This made Qinglong feel even more like a worthless person! Ironically, he had previously been hailed as the number one genius of the Nine Provinces, the world's number one genius.</p><p></p><p>But now, compared to Ye Xiao, he was utterly insignificant.</p>

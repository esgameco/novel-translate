        <h1>Chapter 53</h1>
        <div class="content">
            <p>Here is the full English translation of the Chinese excerpt:</p><p></p><p>Ye Xiao glanced back and saw Gu Hai, who was wearing a uniform.</p><p></p><p>"You're not working properly, what are you doing here?"</p><p></p><p>"I am working! A few of my colleagues and I came to investigate the library theft case from the other day. Isn't Old Yang missing? The higher-ups suspect he did it.</p><p></p><p>They're currently interrogating people on the first floor, and I heard you got promoted, so I sneaked up to play with you for a while."</p><p></p><p>It was highly likely that the matter with Yang Zhengyi would be uncovered, and Ye Xiao was not surprised.</p><p></p><p>After all, since he had disappeared afterwards, as long as one wasn't stupid, they would naturally suspect him.</p><p></p><p>However, Ye Xiao was not worried, as there was not much overlap between him and Yang Zhengyi, so the suspicion would not fall on him.</p><p></p><p>"I'm so envious of you! I just left, and you've already been promoted twice in such a short time, your salary has increased from over 3,000 to 10,000. If I hadn't left back then, I'd probably be a supervisor by now."</p><p></p><p>"Aren't you also preparing for the special training camp? I heard that the salary level after getting into the special training camp is several times that of an ordinary defense team member."</p><p></p><p>"It's not that easy. I'm still doing ideological work for Lanlang. You know, women, they're all the same. Before marriage, they're obedient and clingy, but after marriage, they all turn into nagging mothers-in-law, this won't work, that won't work."</p><p></p><p>Ye Xiao replied calmly:</p><p></p><p>"This is very normal. The clingy and obedient behavior before marriage is the nature of a young girl, naive and carefree, just needing to enjoy the beauty of love, without having to worry about the consequences.</p><p></p><p>At most, she'll cry for a few days after a breakup.</p><p></p><p>The many restrictions after marriage are the nature of a girl transforming into a woman, because she needs to protect her family and ensure that no accidents happen.</p><p></p><p>You find her nagging and doing too many things annoying, but you haven't considered that if you have even the slightest problem, her whole world will collapse.</p><p></p><p>Because now, you are her everything."</p><p></p><p>"You're right about that."</p><p></p><p>Gu Hai laughed foolishly, in this world, having someone other than one's parents who wholeheartedly cares about oneself, isn't that happiness?</p><p></p><p>Decided, I'll be nicer to my wife in the future, and save a hundred less in my private stash each month.</p><p></p><p>"Since that's the case, I'll find an opportunity to communicate with her properly.</p><p>When the end of the month comes and her and Yuyan's studies are over, will you go to the graduation ceremony?"</p><p></p><p>"No."</p><p></p><p>"Come on, you're always holed up in the library reading books, don't you get bored?"</p><p></p><p>"We'll see when the time comes, if I have time and don't feel like reading, I might go take a look."</p><p></p><p>After saying that, Ye Xiao lowered his head to continue reading, but Gu Hai snatched the book away and closed it, looking at the cover.</p><p></p><p>"Reading, reading, you're always hiding in here reading books, when will you find a girlfriend? Huh, the Enduring Cultivation Technique of Wu Style. Old Ye, why are you reading healing techniques again? Weren't you studying spiritual cultivation techniques, wanting to become a beast tamer?"</p><p></p><p>"The cat ran away."</p><p></p><p>"I knew it, your cat is no good, the quality is too low, its intelligence is also low, and the growth limit is also low. Now it's run away, and you've been feeding it so much food for nothing.</p><p></p><p>If you had listened to me earlier and spent some money to buy a star beast with superior bloodline from my friend, you might have been stronger than me by now."</p><p></p><p>Ye Xiao took back the book.</p><p></p><p>"It doesn't matter, I'm just playing around with it anyway. Now that I'm cultivating healing techniques, I feel pretty good about it."</p><p></p><p>"How's your healing technique cultivation going?"</p><p></p><p>"It's alright."</p><p></p><p>"Then can you heal me? I don't know if I've been too tired lately, I have no energy in the morning at all, but I used to be full of vigor every morning."</p><p></p><p>Ye Xiao's brow furrowed slightly.</p><p></p><p>Here is the full English translation of the Chinese excerpt:</p><p></p><p>"LÃ¼ Wanwan is already pregnant, so you two can't possibly be together at night. You're not going to the Red Romance again, are you?</p><p></p><p>Gu Hai, in the past you could play around since you were single, but now you have a family. If you do this kind of thing again, it would be too much.</p><p></p><p>"What are you thinking? I go to work every day and sit with my father-in-law, and after work I go straight home. When do I have time to go to the Red Romance?"</p><p></p><p>"Then it's probably because you were not disciplined in the past, and you've injured your body and become deficient in qi. I told you long ago that when you're young, you don't cherish it, and in your later years you will surely regret it. Now you're only in your twenties, and already..."</p><p></p><p>Saying that, as your good friend, I still need to help you take a look.</p><p></p><p>Ye Xiao reached out and placed his hand on Gu Hai's wrist, channeling a thread of spiritual energy to perform a healing technique.</p><p></p><p>In fact, he could have released the spiritual energy for long-distance healing, but in front of others, he did not reveal his cultivation, appearing as an ordinary person, so naturally he could not perform long-distance spiritual energy techniques.</p><p></p><p>The weak spiritual energy, through the healing technique, circulated in Gu Hai's meridians, and soon Gu Hai's eyes lit up.</p><p></p><p>"Old Ye, it's effective, it's effective. Ah, look, I'm good again."</p><p></p><p>Gu Hai looked at the high tent in front of him, excitedly waving his hands and feet.</p><p></p><p>"Old Ye, your skills are impressive. In the future, if I don't work in the library anymore, I can go take a healer's certificate and open a clinic or something."</p><p></p><p>Ye Xiao nodded.</p><p></p><p>"Okay, then quickly help me recover. They're going to come to the third floor to interrogate soon, and I have to go with them to give a statement."</p><p></p><p>Ye Xiao spread his hands.</p><p></p><p>"How to recover? I used a healing technique, not some other illusion or anything. It's now in the healthiest state! I haven't learned any curse techniques, so I can't apply any negative effects to it! You can only go back to your wife."</p><p></p><p>Gu Hai: "!"</p><p></p><p>"Then what do I do? I'm at work right now!"</p><p></p><p>"Then how about breaking it off first? After you get off work, I'll use the healing technique to treat you, and you'll be fine."</p><p></p><p>Gu Hai: "!"</p><p></p><p>"Old Ye, I curse your ancestors! You're just a poisonous milk!"</p><p></p><p>With that, he grabbed two paper towels from the table and hurriedly ran to the men's restroom.</p><p></p><p>Half an hour later, when Gu Hai came out of the washroom, rubbing his neck, the interrogation on the third floor was already over.</p><p></p><p>Seeing his slightly pale complexion, as if his body had been emptied again, it was clear that the effect of Ye Xiao's healing technique had worn off.</p><p></p><p>Fortunately, the other colleagues didn't say anything, and Gu Hai finally breathed a sigh of relief.</p><p></p><p>"Old Ye, we've finished the interrogation on our side, so let's go back to the team first. If you have any clues, let me know anytime, there's a reward."</p><p></p><p>Ye Xiao nodded.</p><p></p><p>"Also, our team has now been required to search for those two peerless experts from Jianghai. If you have any clues, let me know as well. The reward for that is especially high, 200,000 soft currency, as long as you provide the correct clue."</p><p></p><p>"I understand."</p><p></p><p>Ye Xiao replied, but his thoughts couldn't help but become active again.</p><p></p><p>Unexpectedly, this day has come! Although his cultivation was also quite impressive before, at most he was just a Grandmaster, and his influence was not that widespread, so other places would not pay too much attention. Jianghai City wouldn't have specifically looked for him either.</p><p></p><p>But now, even the avatar of the King of Aer has been destroyed. Those in power must have noticed his existence. They couldn't just ignore a Grandmaster-level expert.</p><p></p><p>(This chapter ends)</p>

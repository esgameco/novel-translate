        <h1>Chapter 419</h1>
        <div class="content">
            <p>Here is the full English translation of the Chinese excerpt:</p><p></p><p>What is this situation? He himself is more aware of his own strength than anyone else.</p><p></p><p>It is impossible for him to defeat enemies above his level, even if he wields a divine weapon.</p><p></p><p>Because, while weapons can provide a certain degree of enhancement, there are limits to that enhancement.</p><p></p><p>It's like, when a car is refueled, the performance difference between using 92-octane gasoline and 98-octane gasoline is completely different.</p><p></p><p>The gap in the enhancement provided by divine weapons is even more exaggerated than that.</p><p></p><p>If an Emperor Realm cultivator at the first dragon level can increase his power by a certain multiple, then an Emperor Realm cultivator at the tenth dragon level may increase his power by more than 20 times, not just 10 times!</p><p></p><p>After so much cultivation, the Sage Emperor's cultivation has only just reached the seventh dragon level of the Emperor Realm, while his opponent's strength is at the ninth dragon level of the Emperor Realm.</p><p></p><p>The opponent's weapon, although just an Emperor Weapon, can be considered one of the finest Emperor Weapons.</p><p></p><p>So, by normal logic, he absolutely should not be able to easily defeat this opponent in battle.</p><p></p><p>Even if it doesn't result in a stalemate, exchanging hundreds of moves should still be no problem.</p><p></p><p>But now, he has directly killed the opponent with a single strike.</p><p></p><p>This is simply beyond his imagination.</p><p></p><p>It's as if something completely impossible has happened.</p><p></p><p>Just as he was stunned and dumbfounded, the Azure Dragon behind him suddenly shouted loudly, "Senior Zhu, don't space out. Be careful ahead!"</p><p></p><p>The Sage Emperor snapped back to his senses, and at that moment, a powerful expert had appeared in front of him, wielding an Emperor Weapon long saber, charging straight towards his face.</p><p></p><p>The long saber was emanating a chilling, icy glow, and even more terrifying was that, it was unknown whether it was due to the lightning-fast attack speed or the special nature of the opponent's cultivation technique, but the surface of the long saber was actually releasing streaks of azure lightning.</p><p></p><p>Making the already extremely cold long saber now exude a murderous aura as if it was seeking his life.</p><p></p><p>The attack speed of an Emperor Realm expert is as fast as lightning, making it extremely difficult to defend against.</p><p></p><p>Everything happened in the blink of an eye, and the opponent's attack had already reached in front of him.</p><p></p><p>The Sage Emperor didn't have time to unleash any techniques, not even enough time to think too much, he could only use the fastest speed to block the opponent's attack with the divine weapon in his hand.</p><p></p><p>In the split second of 0.001 seconds, the opponent's long saber had already struck the Sage Emperor's weapon.</p><p></p><p>The terrifying aura suppressed the Sage Emperor's breathing, making him momentarily think that he might be injured by this blow.</p><p></p><p>"Crack!"</p><p></p><p>However, to his surprise, the moment the opponent's long saber struck his sword, there was a crisp sound, and the opponent's long saber shattered.</p><p></p><p>And the opponent seemed to not have expected this situation either, his body leaning heavily towards the Sage Emperor's sword.</p><p></p><p>He might have thought that his strike would directly cleave the Sage Emperor's sword in two.</p><p></p><p>So he let his guard down, and under the huge impact force, his body was directly cut in half by the Sage Emperor's sword.</p><p></p><p>In that instant, not only was the Sage Emperor stunned, even the opponent was dumbfounded.</p><p></p><p>What is this situation? Is this sword so sharp? It's simply too monstrous!</p><p></p><p>The Sage Emperor snapped out of it after a second, and then pierced the opponent's head with a sword.</p><p></p><p>He finally understood why he was able to defeat an opponent above his level - it was because of the divine weapon given to him by Ye Xiao!</p><p></p><p>It's simply too powerful! The enhancement it provided was so high that it exceeded the opponent's strength.</p><p></p><p>It's like refueling a car, the difference between 92-octane and 98-octane matters, but an even more important factor affecting speed is the car itself!</p><p></p><p>A car worth a few tens of thousands and one worth hundreds of millions or more have a huge gap.</p><p></p><p>Now that he understands this, the Sage Emperor's confidence has increased exponentially!</p><p></p><p>He doesn't know how powerful of an opponent he can defeat now, but at least, he shouldn't have much trouble dealing with the current enemies.</p><p></p><p>Or rather, they should be able to safely ensure their survival today.</p><p></p><p>With this newfound confidence, the Sage Emperor completely unleashed his combat tactics, stepping forward aggressively to engage in frenzied slaughter.</p><p></p><p>Now, he seems to have returned to that time more than two years ago, before the Divine Clan's arrival, when he was one of the strongest experts in this star domain.</p><p></p><p>Dominating the winds and clouds, slaughtering countless enemies! But in these past two years, he had become like an insignificant pawn, not only unable to provide any help to Ye Xiao, but gradually marginalized and fading into obscurity.</p><p></p><p>And now, he is once again experiencing that feeling of being a powerful expert who can dictate the lives of others, dominating the winds and clouds.</p><p></p><p>This makes his eyes involuntarily well up with emotion.</p><p></p><p>All of this is given to him by Ye Xiao.</p><p></p><p>Ye Xiao, just how powerful are you? How monstrous are you? You can even eliminate the Ancient Venom that the Xuantuang Divine Clan was powerless against.</p><p></p><p>You can now even enhance a single person's combat strength, what other unknown methods are you still hiding? Not only him, but even Azure Dragon, White Tiger, Vermilion Bird, and Bei Tang Ce, are all deeply shocked by these divine weapons.</p><p></p><p>They had previously known that Ye Xiao had given them divine weapons...</p><p></p><p>Here is the full English translation of the Chinese excerpt:</p><p></p><p>However, they did not expect these divine weapons to be so terrifying! To reach such a demonic level.</p><p></p><p>Divine weapons also have a hierarchy of strength.</p><p></p><p>Weak divine weapons, even if they are powerful, can at most be stronger than the supreme imperial weapons. If the opponent wields a supreme imperial weapon, and their cultivation is just slightly higher than theirs, the gap in the power of their weapons can be evened out.</p><p></p><p>But now, Ye Xiao's divine weapons have already told them through actual combat that they are very strong! And not just strong in a general sense, but terrifyingly powerful.</p><p></p><p>The originally arrogant disciples of the Hundred Tribes Alliance were instantly reduced to a disadvantage by Jing Di and the others. "Damn it! How can their weapons be so strong?"</p><p></p><p>"They must have dug out the supreme treasure weapons from the divine tomb! Those are definitely divine weapons, and they are of very high quality divine weapons.</p><p></p><p>Don't attack the others anymore, snatch the divine weapons from their hands. Those are priceless treasures."</p><p></p><p>The next moment, all the remaining experts gathered together.</p><p></p><p>The pressure on them increased slightly.</p><p></p><p>Taking advantage of the White Tiger's inattention, two of them surrounded and attacked her from the front and back. The White Tiger Venerable had just started to activate her armor and had not fully adapted to it, so she was unable to react in time and was struck on the chest by their sword.</p><p></p><p>"No!"</p><p></p><p>Her expression changed abruptly, and the rest were also extremely worried.</p><p></p><p>However, just as everyone thought she was doomed, the sword that struck her body was instantly shattered, and the weapon fragments were repelled with great force, injuring the attacker's body instead.</p><p></p><p>The White Tiger was shocked for a moment, then immediately drew her sword and beheaded the opponent.</p><p></p><p>This scene made the others extremely envious.</p><p></p><p>But at the same time, it also gave Jing Di and the others a whole new understanding of the incredible power of the armor that Ye Xiao had given them.</p><p></p><p>Wow, with this thing worn on their bodies, they were practically invincible. Among the current enemies, no one could kill them.</p><p></p><p>Knowing this, Jing Di and the others completely let go, no longer caring about anything else, and rushed to slaughter the opponents.</p><p></p><p>Since the opponents could not break through their defenses, they no longer needed to dodge their attacks and could just charge in to crush them.</p><p></p><p>"Damn it! Retreat!"</p><p></p><p>At this moment, no matter how covetous they were of the divine weapons in the opponents' hands, they had no choice but to flee.</p><p></p><p>Unfortunately, it was already too late, the best opportunity had been missed.</p><p></p><p>Now, they only had death awaiting them.</p><p></p><p>Jing Di and the others quickly eliminated all the opponents here, and the other XuanYuan Clan companions had mostly died or fled in the previous battle, leaving only this last wave.</p><p></p><p>Jing Di and the others had a faint smile on their faces.</p><p></p><p>"Today was so satisfying! I thought we would die here. But unexpectedly, not only did we not die, we also slaughtered so many of them."</p><p></p><p>"All of this is thanks to Ye Xiao! If it weren't for the powerful divine weapons and the incredibly tough armor he gave us, we might have suffered heavy losses today."</p><p></p><p>At this, an expression of deep gratitude appeared in their eyes.</p><p></p><p>Such good things, Ye Xiao didn't even want to use them himself, but instead gave them all to them. This was such a touching gesture! They must treat Ye Xiao even better a hundredfold in the future.</p><p></p><p>Otherwise, they would not be worthy of Ye Xiao's kindness.</p><p></p><p>"Now that everyone here is dead, let's quickly clean up the battlefield and collect the resources from the divine tomb."</p><p></p><p>"Yes! Time waits for no one, we don't have much time to waste."</p><p></p><p>In the Hundred Tribes Alliance, accompanied by the experts of the various tribes, they gradually stationed themselves in the temporary star island they had occupied. The atmosphere on the entire star island also became more solemn.</p><p></p><p>Every day, the Hundred Tribes Alliance would welcome more experts.</p><p></p><p>Although currently there were no God Emperors stationed here, the Hundred Tribes Alliance had also received many late-stage Slay God Realm experts.</p><p></p><p>Because the Hundred Tribes Alliance had very few God Emperor realm experts, and they were far inferior to the XuanYuan Clan in this regard, God Emperors could not be deployed casually.</p><p></p><p>There was another very important issue.</p><p></p><p>Although the XuanYuan Clan had God Emperors, they needed to be stationed on some of the XuanYuan Clan's more important star islands or mineral resource sites.</p><p></p><p>But if the Hundred Tribes Alliance really deployed God Emperor realm experts to annihilate the XuanYuan Clan's descendants, the other side would not simply sit by and watch.</p><p></p><p>If they really angered the other side, even if they had to temporarily abandon some resources, they would still choose to come and defend the dignity of the XuanYuan Clan.</p><p></p><p>By then, they would be in big trouble.</p><p></p><p>This can also be understood as a common strategic principle in the starry sky.</p><p></p><p>As long as our side does not deploy God Emperor experts, the other side will not casually deploy God Emperor experts either! But once our side deploys God Emperor experts, the other side may deploy even more God Emperors!</p><p></p><p>Of course, relying on just this alone would not be enough to keep the XuanYuan Clan from taking action.</p><p></p><p>There was another major reason.</p><p></p><p>(This chapter is complete)</p>

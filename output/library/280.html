        <h1>Chapter 280</h1>
        <div class="content">
            <p>Here is the full English translation of the Chinese excerpt:</p><p></p><p>"Great Lord Tiger God, hurry and leave, you must not come here!" At this time, the black clouds in the sky above had already completely approached the Jianghai City, gradually swallowing the airspace above the city.</p><p></p><p>The vast, oppressive black clouds made it difficult for everyone to even breathe.</p><p></p><p>The pressure from the other side was simply too strong, and some warriors with insufficient strength even felt that they could hardly stand up.</p><p></p><p>"What a powerful pressure. Which powerful expert has arrived?"</p><p></p><p>"This expert is several times stronger than the previous ones who came."</p><p></p><p>"Not just that, I feel that the two experts from the other day are not as strong as the one who has just arrived."</p><p></p><p>"This power, it seems to have surpassed the Xiantian realm and reached the legendary Wangjing realm, the realm above Xiantian."</p><p></p><p>Liuxing Xun looked at the scene in the sky, and his heart couldn't help but beat faster.</p><p></p><p>"When did this world accumulate so many powerful experts? Why have they all gathered in Jianghai City?"</p><p></p><p>The momentum of the black clouds was simply too powerful, and as they continued to gather above Jianghai City, the pressure was further increasing.</p><p></p><p>Within the black clouds, Zhenxing Tiger and Bloodwing stood tall, their clothes fluttering in the spiritual energy, and their eyes were firmly fixed on the ground below.</p><p></p><p>"Tiger God, are your subordinates really down there? I can't even sense the aura of a single star beast."</p><p></p><p>"Their auras have disappeared in this city. I'm not sure if they are here or not. But even if they are not here, I should be able to find some clues from down there."</p><p></p><p>As soon as he finished speaking, several familiar auras were suddenly detected by his divine sense.</p><p></p><p>Zhenxing Tiger's pupils suddenly shrank, and he clenched his fists, his eyes slightly reddening.</p><p></p><p>He let out a long, heavy breath, and the murderous intent flashed in his eyes.</p><p></p><p>"It's here. I can feel that they are calling out to me, asking me to rescue them. </p><p></p><p>They must have been imprisoned by someone, which is why I couldn't sense their auras before.</p><p></p><p>But now it's fine. Since I've found them, I must rescue them."</p><p></p><p>The joints of Zhenxing Tiger's fingers cracked as he clenched his fists, his eyes filled with unwavering determination and raging fury.</p><p></p><p>Bloodwing couldn't help but laugh beside him:</p><p></p><p>"These human race are getting more and more audacious. They dare to imprison the subordinates of the Tiger God? They are truly stupid enough to find a toilet to defecate in.</p><p></p><p>Offending you, Brother Tiger God, isn't that just courting death? Brother Tiger God, do you want me to lend a hand? I can first clean up all these small fries."</p><p></p><p>His eyes were filled with a bloodthirsty light.</p><p></p><p>The spiritual blood of the human race in the Nine Provinces contained the most divine blood.</p><p></p><p>He loved the fresh blood of the human race the most. </p><p></p><p>There were so many here, and he could take the opportunity to absorb a batch, which would not be a waste of his trip.</p><p></p><p>But Zhenxing Tiger's face turned ice-cold as he said, "You dare to make a move?"</p><p></p><p>That icy gaze made Bloodwing shudder, and he hurriedly waved his hands, saying, "I was just joking, I was just joking. How dare I compete with Brother Tiger God? Since this group of lowly humans have offended Brother Tiger God, naturally they should be judged by Brother Tiger God."</p><p></p><p>"Hmph!"</p><p></p><p>Zhenxing Tiger snorted coldly and began to step down.</p><p></p><p>Bloodwing smacked his lips behind him, his eyes gleaming with a hint of gloating as he looked at the city of Jianghai below.</p><p></p><p>"What a bunch of fools! They offended the wrong person. </p><p></p><p>Zhenxing Tiger is a mighty general under the Xingkong Supergod Forest, and the amount of human blood he has shed is countless.</p><p></p><p>He is also ranked first on the Star Ranking. If he were on the ground, he would definitely be among the top few on the Dragon Ranking.</p><p></p><p>With him taking action, this city will be completely destroyed today!"</p><p></p><p>Then, he changed the subject, his face darkening with a sinister smile.</p><p></p><p>"With Zhenxing Tiger here, I must find a way to lure him to the Changbai Dragon Vein and help me obtain that dragon vein again.</p><p></p><p>The dragon veins of the Nine Provinces are the strongest in this world. Although the Changbai Dragon Vein is the last dragon vein in the Nine Provinces, it is not to be underestimated.</p><p></p><p>If I can find this dragon vein, I will have a chance to advance to the Supergod Realm."</p><p></p><p>Zhenxing Tiger descended towards the ground of Jianghai City, and as he fell, the vast black clouds in the sky also formed a huge black tentacle that descended with him.</p><p></p><p>The black clouds enveloped Zhenxing Tiger's burly figure as it descended, and the aura it exuded pressed down on the countless warriors, making it difficult for them to even raise their heads.</p><p></p><p>Zhenxing Tiger's strength was truly too powerful! Even among the Wangbing realm, he was not a character that ordinary people could easily match.</p><p></p><p>On the Star Battlefield, the Wangbing experts of the human race and the Shenshou experts of the star beasts numbered over a hundred.</p><p></p><p>But among these many Wangbing experts, he could still rank 97th on the Star Ranking.</p><p></p><p>This strength was enough to make countless people and star beasts look up to him in awe.</p><p></p><p>After all, the human race had already exceeded billions, and the star beasts were even more numerous.</p><p></p><p>Here is my translation of the Chinese excerpt you provided:</p><p></p><p>This total number, when added up, exceeds even trillions! Among such a vast multitude of lives, to occupy the top hundred positions, what a brilliant and dazzling achievement is that?</p><p></p><p>Zhen Xinghu also had absolute confidence, confident that this human race on the ground had no strength that could pose a threat to him. </p><p></p><p>In his eyes, they were just a group of tiny ants, and he could easily wipe out this entire city with just a casual slap of his hand.</p><p></p><p>By the time he found his subordinates, it would also be the moment of the downfall of Jianghai City. It wouldn't take long, just a few minutes.</p><p></p><p>Zhen Xinghu had already pronounced a death sentence on Jianghai City.</p><p></p><p>Li Liushui, from the Jianghai Martial Arts University, saw this scene and couldn't help but feel a shiver in his heart.</p><p></p><p>Is this the power of an old-school divine beast expert? Just yesterday, he had just reached the King Realm level, and had just begun to comprehend the power of that realm.</p><p></p><p>At this moment, in this Jianghai Martial Arts University, no one understood the strength of the King Realm better than him. Yet even so, when he saw Zhen Xinghu, he realized just how small and insignificant he was, and that reaching the King Realm was just the beginning, far from the end.</p><p></p><p>Fajing couldn't help but exclaim in terror beside him:</p><p></p><p>"Dao Shen, who is this that has come? How did they stir up such a commotion?"</p><p></p><p>Li Liushui shook his head. </p><p></p><p>"I don't know either. This is no longer something we can get involved in."</p><p></p><p>Aro couldn't help but speak up beside them:</p><p></p><p>"Then should we flee immediately?"</p><p></p><p>Li Liushui paused, then shook his head and smiled.</p><p></p><p>"We may not be able to defeat him, but that doesn't mean others can't. Don't worry, if one day true great danger comes to this world, Jianghai City will be the safest place."</p><p></p><p>Fajing and Aro couldn't help but be shaken by this, exchanging a glance.</p><p></p><p>If even Dao Shen Li Liushui, who had already reached the King Realm, would say this, good heavens, what kind of monsters could Jianghai City possibly be hiding?</p>

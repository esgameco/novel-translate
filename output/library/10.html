        <h1>Chapter 10</h1>
        <div class="content">
            <p>Here is the full English translation of the Chinese excerpt:</p><p></p><p>"Haha, how refreshing!" </p><p></p><p>On the street, the Stellar Beast Sect Master crushed the two human Sect Masters, Qin Shenglong and Ouyang Yunzhong, with unrestrained delight.</p><p></p><p>His cultivation was on par with the two of them, all at the Innate First-Grade level.</p><p></p><p>But his mutated shell, like armor, was impervious to blades and spears, allowing him to completely disregard the attacks of the two and unleash his onslaught.</p><p></p><p>As for Qin Shenglong and Ouyang Yunzhong, they could only use their attacks to neutralize the opponent's attacks, unable to fight back at all.</p><p></p><p>Ouyang Yunzhong said grimly, "Go to the library, the top floor has titanium-steel that can withstand its attacks."</p><p></p><p>The words had just fallen, when the aura of the Stellar Beast Sect Master surged even stronger.</p><p></p><p>"Do you think I'll give you a chance to escape? This will be your grave! Stay and die!"</p><p></p><p>A furious roar, infused with the might of towering tidal waves, rushed towards the two.</p><p></p><p>At this moment, the Stellar Beast Sect Master had pushed his power to the limit, determined to crush the two.</p><p></p><p>Qin Shenglong and Ouyang Yunzhong had already reached their limits, unable to further increase their strength. Facing this attack, they were utterly helpless.</p><p></p><p>"It's over!"</p><p>"Are we going to die here?"</p><p>The two were in utter despair.</p><p></p><p>But just then, a golden radiance suddenly shot out from between them, like a sword beam, piercing straight through the body of the Stellar Beast Sect Master.</p><p></p><p>In the blink of an eye, after the light flashed, the humanoid beetle-like Stellar Beast Sect Master and the ground beneath it were shattered in a thunderous explosion.</p><p></p><p>Boom! The earth-shattering roar echoed, and a massive chasm over a kilometer long, five meters wide, and four meters deep, suddenly formed.</p><p></p><p>The entire city trembled from the impact.</p><p></p><p>Dust and smoke rose, forming a kilometer-long screen that obscured people's vision.</p><p></p><p>Plop, plop...</p><p>The Stellar Beast Sect Master had been split in two, falling into the chasm, its green lifeblood and internal organs spilling out all around.</p><p></p><p>Until that moment, its eyes still held the crazed look of one facing death, which meant that it hadn't even had time to react to that strike! Qin Shenglong and Ouyang Yunzhong were dumbfounded, one sitting on the ground, the other standing motionless, on either side of the chasm.</p><p></p><p>Saved? They were saved just like that? The opponent had slain the Stellar Beast Sect Master with a single move? If they hadn't seen it with their own eyes, they wouldn't have believed it even if they were beaten to death.</p><p></p><p>And that sword mark was so familiar - wasn't it the mysterious expert from the other night?</p><p></p><p>"Old Qin, look." </p><p>Ouyang Yunzhong's vision was excellent, and she immediately spotted a half-leaf embedded in the building at the end of the sword mark.</p><p></p><p>Qin Shenglong followed her gaze, his pupils constricting as he shuddered.</p><p>"The Grand Sect Master, it must be the Grand Sect Master!"</p><p></p><p>The Stellar Beast Sect Master had said that its shell had been affected by human genetic technology, mutating to the point that no one below the Grand Sect Master could break through it. That meant the attacker's power must be at the Grand Sect Master level! Qin Shenglong and Ouyang Yunzhong were both excited and awestruck, immediately turning back, but they only saw the empty entrance of the library, with no one there.</p><p></p><p>Their excited expressions instantly dimmed.</p><p></p><p>"He must have been nearby just now."</p><p>"What a pity, we couldn't see him in time. It's such a shame! If we could befriend such a powerful expert, it would be a great honor for us."</p><p>"Maybe he didn't want us to know about him. But at least, he's not our enemy. Otherwise, the entire...</p><p></p><p>Here is the full English translation of the Chinese novel excerpt:</p><p></p><p>The Sea City, perhaps no one can stop him. The two let out a soft sigh, rested for a while, and then immediately left the place, as there were still many star beasts that they needed to deal with.</p><p></p><p>As for the corpses in the ravine, the two did not go to handle them, as Ye Xiao's single sword strike had already shattered the opponent's star core, leaving no trace behind, making them almost worthless! And just as the two left, a dark shadow swiftly arrived at the scene, staring intently at the corpses in the ravine, his brow furrowed.</p><p></p><p>"Unexpectedly, the Sea City still hides such a powerful expert. It seems that it will take some time to carry out the Unimpeded Plan in the Sea City."</p><p></p><p>With that, he turned and left.</p><p></p><p>At this time, Ye Xiao had already returned to his dormitory.</p><p></p><p>He did not want his identity to be discovered by others.</p><p></p><p>If he were to become like a celebrity, he would have no privacy at all.</p><p></p><p>This is a small matter, but if he were to provoke a powerful star beast and it wanted to challenge him, wouldn't that be disastrous? How could he be his own little manager, just reading books and eating every day?</p><p></p><p>The night passed quickly, but this night was particularly restless.</p><p></p><p>On the streets of the Sea City, the defense team was dealing with the remaining star beasts in a tense manner.</p><p></p><p>And the netizens were arguing furiously on the forums.</p><p></p><p>"The Mutant Star Beast Master, overpowering the two sects of the Sea City! The mysterious expert has made a move, turning the tide with a single stroke!"</p><p></p><p>"The mysterious swordmaster has reappeared in the Sea City, what is his true intention?"</p><p></p><p>"The mystery of the master's identity unveiled, a review of the geniuses of the Sea City forty years ago, who has the chance to become a great sect within forty years?"</p><p></p><p>Almost every post was heated up to over 4 million views.</p><p></p><p>It should be known that the entire population of the Sea City is only about 8 million!</p><p></p><p>In just one night, more than half of the people were paying attention to this mysterious expert.</p><p></p><p>Until the next morning, when Ye Xiao woke up, the work group chat was still constantly pushing hot posts and news.</p><p></p><p>While getting up and getting dressed, Ye Xiao looked at the group, his expression unchanged, but he was actually thinking about another matter.</p><p></p><p>"My cultivation is actually only at the Innate First Grade, which can only be considered a master, still two grades away from a Grand Master. But everyone thinks I'm a Grand Master. Could it be that the attack power of my single sword strike has already reached the Innate Fourth Grade?"</p><p></p><p>Cultivation can never be changed, the only question is the sword technique! The higher the grade of the technique, the stronger the attack, even exceeding the current realm.</p><p></p><p>This means that the Heaven and Earth Dominating Sword has already surpassed the master-level technique.</p><p></p><p>"Unexpectedly, the sword technique formed by combining the seven basic sword techniques has already surpassed the master level, then if there are even stronger techniques, I don't know what level they would be. And I don't know what level the Golden Book Spiritual Consciousness is!"</p><p></p><p>However, this also makes Ye Xiao's heart feel more at ease.</p><p></p><p>Because the stronger he is, the safer he will be.</p><p></p><p>After getting dressed, Ye Xiao first went to the cafeteria to have breakfast, and as soon as he clocked in, the director called another routine morning meeting.</p><p></p><p>After fighting the star beasts all night without sleep, the director's complexion was still ruddy, showing no signs of any problems. As a Martial Master realm expert, he had indeed surpassed the normal limits of ordinary humans.</p><p></p><p>"Today's meeting is mainly about the events of last night."</p><p></p><p>(End of this chapter)</p>

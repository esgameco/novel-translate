        <h1>Chapter 264</h1>
        <div class="content">
            <p>Here is the full English translation of the Chinese excerpt:</p><p></p><p>"Resources, resources, always resources. How much resources do we need to satisfy the appetite of these people?"</p><p></p><p>The secretary comforted: "My lord, you don't need to be so anxious. When several cities merge together, the influx of population will naturally lead to a greater demand for resources.</p><p></p><p>Once we get through this buffer period, it will be fine.</p><p></p><p>I have already contacted many material suppliers, asking them to quickly redirect a large amount of resources from various places.</p><p></p><p>It won't be long before the resource problem can be solved."</p><p></p><p>"Tell them to get it done as soon as possible, and let them know that I will loosen some policies to support them."</p><p></p><p>"Understood."</p><p></p><p>The secretary withdrew, and Lord Changfeng felt exhausted.</p><p></p><p>He now feels somewhat overwhelmed.</p><p></p><p>Governing a small city is vastly different from governing a large city.</p><p></p><p>Any single point of failure can lead to all sorts of chaos, especially when it comes to people's livelihood and martial arts resources, which are the most serious issues.</p><p></p><p>The livelihood issue is manageable, as food and the like can be easily redirected from other cities.</p><p></p><p>But martial arts resources are not so easy.</p><p></p><p>Not that it's their fault, as the world is simply like this - resources are far too limited.</p><p></p><p>Whether it's elixirs, weapons, or the materials for crafting elixirs and weapons, they are all in severe shortage for the current human population.</p><p></p><p>Other cities are still relatively stable for now, but if they release resources in large quantities, it will easily lead to resource scarcity and price hikes, causing a lot of trouble.</p><p></p><p>So they cannot openly mobilize these resources.</p><p></p><p>The Nine Provinces Alliance can only allocate some resources from the alliance, the rest have to rely on the local merchant guilds.</p><p></p><p>Anything related to human society is complex.</p><p></p><p>But at the end of the day, the root cause is still the lack of cultivation resources.</p><p></p><p>Lord Changfeng now truly wishes he had a hundred mountains of gold and silver, filled with all kinds of heavenly and earthly treasures, with endless forging materials inside. That way, he would not have to worry like he does now.</p><p></p><p>In fact, even just a single mountain filled with materials would be a godsend and a lifesaver for him.</p><p></p><p>On Ye Xiao's side, after several busy nights, the farm has finally entered a normal state of operation.</p><p></p><p>An entire small mountain over 200 meters tall has been completely planted with heavenly and earthly treasures.</p><p></p><p>Due to the formation array, these heavenly and earthly treasures are able to absorb spiritual energy at an extremely fast rate.</p><p></p><p>Much faster than when they were in the Southwest Forest.</p><p></p><p>Because even though the Southwest Forest had a dragon vein, the area was still too vast.</p><p></p><p>The dragon vein could only provide a broad absorption, gathering the spiritual energy within the Southwest Forest, leaving the rest for the heavenly and earthly treasures to cultivate on their own.</p><p></p><p>This speed was not actually that fast, because the heavenly and earthly treasures themselves had a slow absorption and connection speed.</p><p></p><p>To be more precise, before they developed spiritual consciousness, they were just ordinary plants at the bottom of the food chain.</p><p></p><p>It was only after absorbing the essence of the sun and moon that they could possess the complete awareness like humans and spirit beasts.</p><p></p><p>It's as if when others have already gained intelligence, you've just barely developed a tiny bit of consciousness.</p><p></p><p>The starting line is far behind.</p><p></p><p>But now, with Ye Xiao setting up a formation array here, everything is different.</p><p></p><p>Since the area is small, and the spiritual gathering formation is extremely powerful, the heavenly and earthly treasures, even if they don't want to absorb, their bodies will still frantically absorb the overly dense spiritual energy.</p><p></p><p>The end result is like using fertilizer - the growth is thriving.</p><p></p><p>The heavenly and earthly treasures are rapidly growing upwards.</p><p></p><p>Two-hundred-year-old ginseng, four-hundred-year-old lingzhi, five-hundred-year-old he shou wu - they have everything in abundance, more than they can use.</p><p></p><p>The years mentioned for the heavenly and earthly treasures do not actually refer to their lifespan.</p><p></p><p>They judge their value not by the number of years, but by the level of cultivation within their bodies.</p><p></p><p>For example, if a ginseng can cultivate in one night the same level of attainment that a normal ginseng can achieve in a year, then it can be considered a one-year-old ginseng.</p><p></p><p>If it can cultivate the attainment of a hundred-year-old ginseng in one night, then it is a hundred-year-old ginseng.</p><p></p><p>Standing on the mountain top, Ye Xiao looked at all the heavenly and earthly treasures he had planted, feeling quite content.</p><p></p><p>With this farm, he no longer needs to worry about obtaining heavenly and earthly treasures in the future.</p><p></p><p>This way, both the breeding ground and the farm have been fully taken care of.</p><p></p><p>He just needs to continue expanding the variety of species going forward.</p><p></p><p>However, this farm will still need to be expanded further.</p><p></p><p>Farms require much more land than breeding grounds. The land needed for a farm far exceeds what the spirit beasts need.</p><p></p><p>The spirit beasts can be placed vertically, with one above, one below, and one in the middle. But farms cannot do that, as the vast majority of the land has to be used for planting.</p><p></p><p>Here is my translation of the Chinese excerpt you provided:</p><p></p><p>The natural treasures and resources of the heavens and earth all require a surface position to absorb the sunlight. </p><p></p><p>Ye Xiao estimated that he would gain a massive amount of resources every day, and then invest part of these resources into the star beasts and part into alchemy, pursuing a dual-track approach. This would certainly produce extraordinary results and steadily raise his vital energy.</p><p></p><p>After finishing all of this, Ye Xiao returned to his bed, took out his phone, and glanced over the latest news.</p><p></p><p>The news was all discussing one issue - resources! And the majority of people were talking about martial arts resources. There were shortages of all kinds of resources.</p><p></p><p>Ye Xiao watched this with indifference. He had many resources, but those were things he had personally gone far away to the southwestern forest to obtain. There was no way he would be a good-for-nothing and just give them away to others - that wouldn't be generosity, that would be stupidity!</p><p></p><p>If there was a star beast invasion that would kill many people, and he had the power but didn't lend a hand to help, that would be cold-blooded and heartless. </p><p></p><p>But the resource issue wasn't a life-or-death problem - at most it would just mean they cultivated a day or two slower.</p><p></p><p>Furthermore, the spiritual energy in Jianghai City was abundant, so cultivating there would be much faster than in other places.</p><p></p><p>Another issue was that the things he had brought back from the southwestern forest were basically all high-quality. So for these ordinary martial artists, they were unable to use them. Their current cultivation was too low - they could only refine the more inferior materials into elixirs. If they used the higher quality materials, it would exceed the limits their bodies could withstand, and could even destroy their bodies. At best it would shatter their meridians, at worst it could be fatal.</p><p></p><p>Too good of things are not necessarily good for the weak. It could even be like a poison.</p><p></p><p>But even so, Ye Xiao still had kindness towards them. He had used those materials to greatly enhance the star beasts in the breeding ground, which in turn strengthened the spiritual vortex in Jianghai City and allowed it to absorb spiritual energy even faster. In this way, these martial artists were still benefiting from Ye Xiao's grace.</p><p></p><p>Meanwhile, far away in the West, a figure suddenly appeared in the dark church hidden in the wilderness...</p>

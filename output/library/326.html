        <h1>Chapter 326</h1>
        <div class="content">
            <p>Here is the full English translation of the Chinese excerpt:</p><p></p><p>The massive body of the Overlord Ape was sent flying like a cannonball, crashing into the ground and creating a huge deep pit.</p><p></p><p>Before it could even react, the next moment, Ye Xiao had already swung the Earthly King Dragon and struck again.</p><p></p><p>Boom, boom, boom - violent explosions reverberated across the earth as Ye Xiao used the Earthly King Dragon to lash the Overlord Ape. These two supreme divine beasts were now being toyed with by Ye Xiao like mere ants.</p><p></p><p>The Overlord Ape rolled on the ground, letting out miserable cries. Whenever it tried to run, Ye Xiao would strike it back down. The Earthly King Dragon, being a supreme divine beast as well, had a body and vital energy as sturdy as the Overlord Ape's. Being whipped by it was agonizingly painful.</p><p></p><p>The Earthly King Dragon fared even worse - it felt like its body was about to break apart from the very first strike Ye Xiao used on the Overlord Ape.</p><p></p><p>The force acted upon them mutually - its body was not stronger than the Overlord Ape's, as only a part of the Overlord Ape's body was being struck, while the Earthly King Dragon's entire body was bearing the force.</p><p></p><p>Each strike by Ye Xiao made the Earthly King Dragon feel like it would be better off dead. Eventually, the pain had even started to numb.</p><p></p><p>It could no longer even feel the pain. The Earthly King Dragon wanted to cry - why did it have to come here and get bullied? Couldn't it have just continued capturing the remaining human tribes and refining their divine blood elsewhere?</p><p></p><p>The human tribes of the Nine States, on the other hand, were greatly excited.</p><p></p><p>"Good! Well done!"</p><p>"Senior Sword Immortal is so handsome!"</p><p></p><p>Watching the supreme divine beasts, two of them working together against Ye Xiao, only to be caught and brutally beaten, this thrilling and exciting scene made their eyes shine with delight. Praises and admiration rang out without end.</p><p></p><p>After striking for dozens of seconds, Ye Xiao no longer wasted time and sealed the powers of the two divine beasts that he had knocked unconscious, preparing to toss them into his spatial ring.</p><p></p><p>Just then, a furious roar suddenly came from the sky.</p><p></p><p>"Human trash! Who gave you the audacity to capture the supreme experts of my Divine Beast Clan? Release them at once!"</p><p></p><p>The Qing Long and the others were startled.</p><p></p><p>"Another supreme expert has arrived, and this time the aura is even stronger! A total of five!"</p><p></p><p>But Ye Xiao paid them no mind and directly tossed the two supreme divine beasts into his spatial ring.</p><p></p><p>Inside the spatial ring, the divine beasts were still angrily denouncing Ye Xiao's shamelessness, when two more massive figures suddenly fell in.</p><p></p><p>Boom! Boom!</p><p></p><p>Hearing these two thunderous impacts, the divine beasts looked at the newcomers with bewildered expressions.</p><p></p><p>"These two... Aren't they the Overlord Ape and the Earthly King Dragon?"</p><p>"Their vital energies seem to have also been elevated to the supreme divine realm!"</p><p>"Another two supreme divine beasts captured by this kid? What kind of despicable tricks and shameless methods did he use?"</p><p></p><p>The Great Emperor Dragon Lion furrowed his brows tightly.</p><p></p><p>This person was simply too unorthodox. And he was far too monstrous as well. How could one person alone accomplish all this? In the blink of an eye, he had annihilated one supreme divine beast and captured two more.</p><p></p><p>Now, even if he tried to bluff, he would have no way to save face.</p><p></p><p>Outside the spatial ring, five supreme divine beings had descended from the sky.</p><p></p><p>Five attacks of different colors fell from above simultaneously.</p><p></p><p>A Thunder Seal Fist! Wrapped in thunderous lightning, over 100,000 meters in diameter, it stirred the clouds and tore through the sky.</p><p></p><p>A Nine Spirit Wind Blade! Splitting the clouds and creating a rift over 100,000 meters long, the wind blade and spiritual energy ignited raging flames.</p><p></p><p>A Fire Dragon Emperor Fist! The fist light transformed into a fiery red dragon shadow, shooting down like a sharp arrow.</p><p></p><p>A Heavenly Slashing Sword Beam! The sword beam stretched like a celestial pillar, unending and razor-sharp, causing the clouds to part and retreat, unwilling to clash against it.</p><p></p><p>An Eight Wilderness Falling Star! As the cultivation technique descended, it attracted countless earth elements from the air, rapidly condensing into an enormous meteor. And as it fell, the meteor's power continued to grow and solidify.</p><p></p><p>These five attacks were all imperial arts, the mightiest techniques wielded by the supreme divine beings behind them. </p><p></p><p>As the five attacks fell from the clouds, the oppressive pressure they exerted could have destroyed the entire world. The sky was filled with lightning and thunder, the sun had long since disappeared, and only the light of these attacks illuminated the land.</p><p></p><p>It was as if...</p><p></p><p>Here is the full English translation of the Chinese excerpt:</p><p></p><p>Five orbs of light in different colors appeared in the sky.</p><p></p><p>Blue, green, red, gold, and black!</p><p></p><p>All the martial artists on the land of the Nine Provinces were under immense pressure, and some with extremely weak cultivation, who were at the very bottom of the hierarchy, immediately knelt on the ground.</p><p></p><p>Their physical bodies were not strong enough to withstand the might of these techniques, which were still above the Nine Heavens. If these techniques were to descend from an altitude of tens of thousands of meters, their physical bodies would be crushed and exploded by the sheer force alone!</p><p></p><p>Ye Xiao looked at the five descending techniques with a calm and steady gaze, not the slightest bit flustered.</p><p></p><p>The moment the opponent's techniques appeared, he unleashed a sword strike! It was a simple yet supremely powerful sword strike, exuding an unmatched might. The cultivation techniques of both sides were operating at an extremely fast speed, but due to the great distance, it did not appear too fast, able to reach the target instantly.</p><p></p><p>People could clearly see that the sword beam unleashed by Ye Xiao first collided with the Baguang Meteor Shower, directly cleaving through the gradually expanding meteorites with a crushing force.</p><p></p><p>Then, it traced a perfect arc and sliced through the second Slay the Emperor Sword Beam!</p><p></p><p>The Slay the Emperor Sword Beam was cut through as easily as thin paper.</p><p></p><p>Next came the third Heavenly Dragon Emperor Fist, the fourth Nine Spirit Wind Blade, and the fifth Thunder Seal Fist! These emperor-level powerful techniques were utterly annihilated, unable to offer the slightest resistance against Ye Xiao's sword strike at the Slay the Deity level.</p><p></p><p>Boom, boom, boom. Five dazzling beams of light appeared in the sky, illuminating the entire land of the Nine Provinces, blinding the onlookers.</p><p></p><p>Amidst the white radiance, Ye Xiao struck again.</p><p></p><p>The Descend of the Deity Palm was unleashed! Another Slay the Deity level technique! A palm strike soaring towards the sky, the fierce palm wind tearing through the exploding white radiance, directly pushing back the white radiance surrounding Ye Xiao.</p><p></p><p>The five super-divine realm figures in the sky, upon witnessing this, had their faces filled with terror.</p><p></p><p>The five figures did not dare to be careless and struck simultaneously.</p><p></p><p>Emperor-level techniques bombarded relentlessly, one after another, ruthlessly pounding against Ye Xiao's palm wind.</p><p></p><p>But faced with the divine-level Descend of the Deity Palm, even the powerful emperor-level techniques were reduced to mere trash.</p><p></p><p>All the attacks that collided with Ye Xiao's palm wind ultimately exploded, dissipating into dense spiritual energy, unable to inflict any harm on Ye Xiao's palm wind!</p><p></p><p>Seeing Ye Xiao's Descend of the Deity Palm rushing towards them, one of the three-headed winged dragons, the Sea Heavenly Wing, actually turned and fled!</p><p></p><p>"I'm not playing anymore! This guy is not human, he has already ascended to the divine realm."</p><p></p><p>The other four super-divine beasts roared in fury:</p><p></p><p>"Sea Heavenly Wing! You bastard! I'm going to kill you!"</p><p></p><p>Originally, the five super-divine beasts attacking together could still resist some of Ye Xiao's attacks.</p><p></p><p>But now that one had turned to flee, the attacks they could barely withstand before became impossible to resist.</p><p></p><p>The Descend of the Deity Palm surged upwards, instantly slamming into the bodies of the four super-divine beasts.</p><p></p><p>Boom! The powerful palm wind force directly ruptured their internal organs and shattered their blood vessels within a single second.</p><p></p><p>The four super-divine beings lost their combat ability on the spot.</p><p></p><p>As for the fleeing Sea Heavenly Wing, she managed to escape with a relieved smile, exhaling a breath.</p><p></p><p>"Good thing I ran fast! Otherwise, I would've been done for too."</p><p></p><p>However, the moment the words left her mouth, a sword beam slashed across her three necks, causing her to lose control of her own body.</p><p></p><p>Sea Heavenly Wing looked around in bewilderment as the scenery spun, her mind in complete disbelief.</p><p></p><p>What was happening? Her speed was so fast, and she had even fled in advance. Yet, she still couldn't evade Ye Xiao's attack!</p><p></p><p>Sea Heavenly Wing's mind was collapsing into darkness.</p><p></p><p>At this time, the white radiance had completely dissipated, and the onlookers hurriedly looked up to the sky, anxiously asking:</p><p></p><p>"Quick! What's the situation? Has Sword Immortal Senior prevailed?"</p><p></p><p>However, when the people raised their heads to look up at the sky, they were utterly dumbfounded.</p><p></p><p>At this point, no one dared to speak any words of praise or description.</p><p></p><p>Everyone stood rooted to the spot, dumbstruck.</p><p></p><p>Some who had not been forced to kneel by the super-divine beasts' attacks were now stunned and collapsed to the ground by Ye Xiao's methods.</p><p></p><p>At this moment, their concerns were no longer about whether the human realm could defend against the beast invasion, but rather they began to pity the beasts, wondering what they had done wrong, why they had to come to the Nine Provinces, and why they had to encounter Ye Xiao. The people had started to feel truly sorry for these beasts - it was truly tragic! Outnumbered five to one, and yet they were utterly defeated by Ye Xiao without any ability to fight back, all perishing.</p><p></p><p>In the sky, the five massive super-divine beast figures were slowly descending in the sunset, signifying their complete demise.</p>

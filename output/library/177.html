        <h1>Chapter 177</h1>
        <div class="content">
            <p>Here is the full English translation of the Chinese excerpt:</p><p></p><p>The Left Protector looked at the Imperial Soldier in his hand with a hint of reluctance.</p><p></p><p>Although the one in his hand was an Imperial Soldier, it was not the kind that could be used continuously. After this one-time use, he would have no more to use in the future.</p><p></p><p>Otherwise, how powerful would it have to be? But for the sake of Noel Fei's separation, it was worth it.</p><p></p><p>After all, this one-time Imperial Soldier could not be eaten, nor could it increase his own cultivation.</p><p></p><p>Noel Fei, on the other hand, could actually and substantially increase his cultivation and improve his bloodline.</p><p></p><p>With a thought, the spiritual energy had been poured into the Imperial Soldier without end.</p><p></p><p>At this moment, Ye Xiao, who was eating kimchi fried rice with Liu Cheng Xun in the restaurant, suddenly furrowed his brows.</p><p></p><p>He had sensed the aura of an Imperial Soldier, and it was on his formation.</p><p></p><p>Liu Cheng Xun did not cultivate spiritual power like Ye Xiao, so he could not perceive what Ye Xiao could sense with such precision.</p><p></p><p>He was only slightly puzzled by Ye Xiao's expression.</p><p></p><p>"What's wrong?"</p><p></p><p>"Nothing, I just suddenly remembered something I haven't done yet."</p><p></p><p>Ye Xiao casually made up an excuse and didn't pay much attention to it.</p><p></p><p>Although the other party had an Imperial Soldier, it was only a one-time use, and it could only expand the formation by a small margin, allowing only one person to enter. So Ye Xiao didn't need to be vigilant.</p><p></p><p>In fact, the Noel Fei and the others below had many grievances against him, so letting them vent their resentment would make them grow healthier.</p><p></p><p>As for the possibility of them escaping with Noel Fei?</p><p></p><p>Hehe.</p><p></p><p>In the library, the Left Protector used his one-time Imperial Soldier to open a temporary hole in Ye Xiao's Imperial Formation, then took a deep breath and jumped down.</p><p></p><p>"Noel Fei! Obediently become my food!"</p><p></p><p>But as soon as he said these words, he suddenly felt something was wrong.</p><p></p><p>The aura under this sealing formation was so dense! So dense that he felt suppressed and could hardly move his limbs.</p><p></p><p>Wasn't Noel Fei's separation just a primordial seventh-grade Deity Ancestor realm? With a cultivation similar to his own, how could it exert such great suppression on him?</p><p></p><p>Just as he was completely puzzled, the next second, he heard several different voices coming from his ears.</p><p></p><p>"Who is this guy?"</p><p></p><p>"I don't know, he came to look for Senior Noel Fei. Senior Noel Fei, do you know him?"</p><p></p><p>"Know him? Hell no, didn't you hear that he wants to eat me?"</p><p></p><p>"Oh~! Then he's the enemy!"</p><p></p><p>In the darkness, the Deity Ancestor Beasts began to release their powerful auras, and their bodies started to emit flashing lights, forming several beams of light.</p><p></p><p>The Left Protector was immediately completely dumbfounded.</p><p></p><p>What's going on? One, two, three, four, five, six, seven, a total of seven Deity Ancestor Beasts?</p><p></p><p>The Seven Deities Brothers? Didn't they say there was only Noel Fei's separation here? Moreover, in this small Jianghai City, having so many Deity Ancestor Beasts as formation eyes, what are they playing at? No, this is not the time to think about that. With so many Deity Ancestor Beasts here, the key is how to save his own life.</p><p></p><p>Quickly use the Beast Soul Incense.</p><p></p><p>Beast Soul Incense is condensed from the essence blood of countless Beasts, and when burned, it can stimulate the spiritual power of Beasts, making them extremely weak and unable to exert their full strength. It is a specialized tool developed by the human race to deal with Beasts.</p><p></p><p>As long as he had the Beast Soul Incense, even if there were seven Deity Ancestor Beasts here, he would still have a chance to escape.</p><p></p><p>But he thought too optimistically.</p><p></p><p>Just as he was about to take out the Beast Soul Incense, the next second, an extremely powerful force directly hit his shoulder.</p><p></p><p>Boom! The huge force directly dislocated his shoulder, and then other attacks came one after another, bombarding him.</p><p></p><p>In just two seconds, hundreds of attacks had already hit his body, leaving him severely injured.</p><p></p><p>The Deity Ancestor Old Man picked up the Beast Soul Incense that had been knocked out of his hand and sniffed it twice, his expression changing slightly.</p><p></p><p>"It's Beast Soul Incense, this beast is here to deal with us."</p><p></p><p>At these words, the group of Beasts instantly became as cold as ice.</p><p></p><p>"Damn it, bullying the Beasts too much!"</p><p></p><p>"Ye Xiao treats us like livestock, and you also want to come and slaughter us? Drink our blood?"</p><p></p><p>"At least Ye Xiao is handsome and powerful in the human race! You're so ugly and weak, and you dare to set your sights on us? Looking for death!"</p><p></p><p>"Eat him!"</p><p></p><p>The seven Deity Ancestor Beasts were completely enraged to the extreme.</p><p></p><p>How much humiliation and anger had they endured in these days? Although they couldn't beat Ye Xiao, they could at least bear it.</p><p></p><p>But now, this little primordial seventh-grade semi-Beast, also dared to set his sights on them, really treating them like mud to be molded? The Left Protector was torn apart alive by the Beasts, his screams echoing endlessly.</p><p></p><p>"Stop! Stop! I'm the Left Protector of the Beast God Alliance, I have a coordinate position on me.</p><p></p><p>If you kill me, the Alliance Master won't let you off, I'm her lover, she'll definitely come to kill you all! Ahhhhh."</p><p></p><p>After a few more screams, the Left Protector was eventually devoured by the Beasts.</p><p></p><p>The Beasts looked at each other, their mouths full of fresh blood, revealing cruel smiles.</p><p></p><p>Here is the full English translation of the Chinese excerpt:</p><p></p><p>They are star beasts, wild beasts. They don't care who you are, if they're unhappy, they can even eat their own kind, let alone a half-beast like you. To Left Guardian, you are just an appetizer.</p><p></p><p>"Hey, if we eat him, will there really be no problem? What if the alliance leader of the Beast God Alliance comes?"</p><p></p><p>"What are you afraid of?"</p><p></p><p>Noel Fei said while picking his teeth with Left Guardian's arm:</p><p></p><p>"Have you forgotten our current identity? We are now Ye Xiao's poultry! The alliance leader of the Beast God Alliance won't even be able to come over, and even if he dares to come, what is there to be afraid of? </p><p></p><p>Will Ye Xiao let him kill us all?</p><p></p><p>With Ye Xiao's strength, defeating him would be like bullying vegetables."</p><p></p><p>"Oh, I almost forgot about that."</p><p></p><p>"You know, if you look at it this way, being Ye Xiao's poultry doesn't seem too bad. At least when facing such a powerful expert, we are safe."</p><p></p><p>On Ye Xiao's side, he was still eating dinner with Liu Chengxun.</p><p></p><p>"The Nine States pickled vegetables are indeed much more delicious than the Han State ones."</p><p></p><p>Liu Chengxun couldn't help but sigh.</p><p></p><p>After all, it's the Nine States, whether it's the martial arts culture or other cultures, they are things that the Han State can never easily compare to.</p><p></p><p>Ye Xiao smiled and said, "Of course, this is an undisputed fact."</p><p></p><p>A sense of national pride surged in his heart.</p><p></p><p>In this world, perhaps only the descendants of the Nine States have this feeling? A country with a brilliant civilization and culture, this is something that other states can never compare to.</p><p></p><p>"By the way, speaking of which, you have also reached the post-heaven third rank in strength. At such a young age, you still have the opportunity to refine your divine soul and go further. Why don't you refine your divine soul?"</p><p></p><p>"No money."</p><p></p><p>Liu Chengxun was stunned for a moment, then realized that Ye Xiao was just an ordinary person, so he definitely didn't have the money to buy a soul-refining pill.</p><p></p><p>After a brief thought, he spoke up:</p><p></p><p>"How about I help you? You give me an account number, and I'll lend you the money first, and you can pay me back later."</p><p></p><p>"No need, I don't like to owe favors to others. Besides, even if I can cultivate, what realm can I reach?"</p><p></p><p>Liu Chengxun nodded.</p><p></p><p>"That's true."</p><p></p><p>Basically, if one cannot open their divine soul, they won't be able to go too far. Spending so much money to get a soul-refining pill, and it's not even certain that they can refine their divine soul, it would indeed be irrational to go into debt for that.</p><p></p><p>"By the way, I've always had a doubt that I wanted to ask you about. What is the use of the divine soul? Is it just to enhance cultivation?"</p><p></p><p>Ye Xiao has always been very curious about this question, but among the people he has encountered, there are currently not many high-level ones, and Liu Chengxun is the only divine lord he knows, maybe he can explain this question to him.</p><p></p><p>Liu Chengxun wiped his mouth, thought for a moment, and then spoke:</p><p></p><p>"The divine soul, although it is a necessity for cultivation, at first glance, it doesn't seem to have much use. After all, apart from assisting cultivation and enhancing a certain combat power, it cannot be used for active combat, it seems quite useless.</p><p></p><p>But in fact, in our circle of martial arts experts, the understanding of the divine soul is that humans are too weak, and we cannot fully unleash the true power of the divine soul.</p><p></p><p>It is said that only after breaking through to the Emperor Realm can one truly unleash the power of the divine soul.</p><p></p><p>From this perspective, the current most likely answer is that for us, the martial artists below the Emperor Realm can be regarded as trash.</p><p></p><p>Including me, a divine lord.</p><p></p><p>It's just that the overall level of our current world is very low, which makes the Patriarch-level ants seem very strong to people."</p><p></p><p>"So you mean, in the universe, we are just the starting point?"</p><p></p><p>"To be precise, we are not even the starting point.</p><p></p><p>I'm not afraid you'll laugh at me, you must be wondering why there are so many divine lords in this world, even though their strength is very strong, they don't go to the Star Battlefield?</p><p></p><p>You may think that if we go to the Star Battlefield, we can surely help humanity and easily achieve victory, but the real answer will surely make you stunned.</p><p></p><p>The reason why we divine lords don't go to the Star Battlefield has two points.</p><p></p><p>One is that there are also many star beasts infiltrating the Earth, and we need powerful martial artists to suppress them and protect the human race's main base, so that it won't be destroyed by the star beasts.</p><p></p><p>The other is that most divine lords don't dare to go to the Star Battlefield casually."</p><p></p><p>Ye Xiao was stunned.</p><p></p><p>"The Star Battlefield is that dangerous?"</p><p></p><p>"Yes!" </p><p></p><p>Liu Chengxun's face was very solemn as he answered.</p><p></p><p>"Far more dangerous than you can imagine.</p><p></p><p>Although many ordinary martial artists have gone to the Star Battlefield one after another, most of them are just going for tempering, and when the true powerful star beasts appear, divine lords perish in the blink of an eye."</p>

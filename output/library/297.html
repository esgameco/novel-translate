        <h1>Chapter 297</h1>
        <div class="content">
            <p>Here is the full English translation of the Chinese excerpt:</p><p></p><p>After performing this hand seal, a golden coffin suddenly appeared before the Demon King.</p><p></p><p>Inside the coffin lay a corpse that was identical in appearance to the Demon King. </p><p></p><p>It was the Demon King's own body, dressed in the imperial robes of black and red, embroidered with floating dragons and clouds, exuding the majestic aura of an emperor. Gently caressing his own lifeless form, a deep sense of nostalgia could be seen in the Demon King's eyes.</p><p></p><p>Even those at the Emperor Realm are not immune to death! If an Emperor Realm cultivator dies a natural death, their physical body and spiritual soul will permanently separate, never to be reunited again.</p><p></p><p>Even if one tries to return to life by possessing a corpse, they can never regain their former power, and their physical body can no longer be cultivated.</p><p></p><p>This is a situation controlled by the profound truths of the heavens and earth.</p><p></p><p>However, as long as the physical body remains, if the cultivator encounters a powerful attack, they still have a chance to place their soul back into the body and control it in battle. This can be seen as a method to prolong the existence of one's soul, and indirectly, a way to protect one's life.</p><p></p><p>If the physical body is gone, the Demon King would from then on exist only as a pure spiritual entity. </p><p></p><p>He could face the weak, but would be utterly helpless against the strong.</p><p></p><p>Therefore, he had sealed his physical body within this coffin, while placing his soul within this ancient relic.</p><p></p><p>The Demon King had not summoned forth his physical body in a very long time. For all this period, he had existed in this relic solely as a spiritual being, and all the people within this illusory world were conjured by the power of his mind.</p><p></p><p>Although his physical body had perished, it was still his most precious possession. It was the vessel that allowed his soul to endure.</p><p></p><p>And now, in order to fulfill the age-old dream of the human race, to create a cultivator at the Divine Realm, to uncover the profound secrets that had eluded their ancestors for generations - he was prepared to sacrifice his physical body. He would transfer all the divine blood stored within it to Ye Xiao, empowering him to break through to even greater heights.</p><p></p><p>The Demon King had once felt hopeless about this world and the human race. But now, he felt that there was still hope.</p><p></p><p>That hope lay in Ye Xiao. </p><p></p><p>If Ye Xiao could unravel that profound mystery, he would surely be able to save the current human race and change the cruel "survival of the fittest" reality that plagued it! </p><p></p><p>Taking a deep breath, the Demon King placed his palm upon his physical body.</p><p></p><p>Boom! With a thunderous explosion, his body was instantly shattered into a mist of blood.</p><p></p><p>Radiant golden light beamed forth from that blood mist.</p><p></p><p>The Demon King had not activated all the divine blood within him, like Ye Xiao had. He was only transferring the most precious and rare portion of that divine blood to Ye Xiao.</p><p></p><p>With a gesture of his fingers, the divine blood imbued with golden light, drop by drop, seeped into Ye Xiao's body.</p><p></p><p>Ye Xiao, who was in the midst of cultivation, suddenly furrowed his brows.</p><p></p><p>The Demon King immediately shouted, "Do not be distracted, focus on your cultivation! Do not rush to break through yet. First, completely refine all the divine blood I have given you. The more divine blood you can refine at your current level, the stronger your foundation will be when you do eventually break through!"</p><p></p><p>Ye Xiao's mind steadied, and he shifted his focus to refining the divine blood instead of advancing further.</p><p></p><p>The Demon King then spoke:</p><p></p><p>"After breaking through to the Emperor Realm, what you need to cultivate is dragon qi. An Emperor Realm cultivator is essentially a massive dragon vein, constantly absorbing the spiritual energy of heaven and earth at an extremely rapid pace, forming dragon qi within their body.</p><p></p><p>Refining dragon qi is the hallmark of the Emperor Realm. Dragon qi is the most important force for tempering one's divine spirit and replenishing it.</p><p></p><p>After becoming an Emperor, you must devote yourself fully to cultivating, absorbing spiritual energy, and allowing your dragon qi to reach one hundred and eight streams, refining your divine spirit to the utmost, achieving complete fusion with your physical body.</p><p></p><p>Only then will you have a chance to glimpse the legendary Divine Realm!"</p><p></p><p>Ye Xiao silently committed these words to memory and began refining the divine blood gifted to him by the Demon King.</p><p></p><p>Although this divine blood was of the same nature as the divine blood within Ye Xiao, it contained the powerful consciousness of the Demon King from when he was alive. Therefore, it would not be easily subdued by Ye Xiao.</p><p></p><p>Ye Xiao would have to completely erase all the remnants of the Demon King's will within the blood before he could truly master and refine it.</p><p></p><p>After Ye Xiao and Ning Yuheng entered the Emperor Realm inheritance, the Silver Fox Clan once again enjoyed a period of peace and tranquility.</p><p></p><p>However, the Fox Empress was still very resolute. She knew that the few who had fled might return, possibly with even more star beasts in tow.</p><p></p><p>So, immediately after the two had entered the inheritance, she had her clan disciples quickly set up formations to tightly guard the entire Silver Fox Valley.</p><p></p><p>Yet, despite these preparations, the Empress's greatest fear came true on the fifth day.</p><p></p><p>In the starry sky, several massive ships slowly drifted into view. These ships were equipped with spirit gathering formations, using the power of spirit stones to drive the formations and generate immense propulsive force to propel the vessels forward.</p><p></p><p>These gigantic ships were like towering mountains...</p><p></p><p>Here is my translation of the Chinese excerpt:</p><p></p><p>At the forefront of the fleet, a massive black wolf-headed flag hung, the wolf's head blood-red.</p><p></p><p>Under the wolf-headed flag sat a figure over 4 meters tall - a burly wolf-man, his muscular body exuding an oppressive aura that made it hard to breathe.</p><p></p><p>Beside him were the few star beasts that had just escaped from Silver Fox Valley.</p><p></p><p>"Wolf God, Silver Fox Valley is just ahead."</p><p></p><p>The Wolf God's gaze spread out like a sharp sword, penetrating into the vast expanse of the starry sky towards the great chasm of Silver Fox Valley, as if he could see through everything within in an instant.</p><p></p><p>"They've set up so many formations, but do they really think hiding inside will be of any use? </p><p></p><p>Ridiculous!</p><p></p><p>Before me, these are nothing but flimsy paper.</p><p></p><p>Notify them, advance at full speed."</p><p></p><p>"Yes!"</p><p></p><p>Inside Silver Fox Valley, the fox clan members had already spotted the fleet in the starry sky and couldn't help but exclaim in alarm: "Fox Queen, look! Enemies are coming!"</p><p></p><p>The Fox Queen had naturally noticed them long ago, and her gaze was now heavy with seriousness.</p><p></p><p>"Have the children all been hidden away?"</p><p></p><p>"Yes, Fox Queen, they have all been hidden."</p><p></p><p>"Good! Our formations should be able to hold out for a while. During this time, no one is allowed to go out recklessly. Violators will be executed without mercy."</p><p></p><p>"Yes!"</p><p></p><p>The crowd responded in unison, bracing for battle.</p><p></p><p>The Fox Queen looked towards the imperial inheritance relic, clenching her fists with a grave expression:</p><p></p><p>"Yutian, Mr. Ye, you must hurry and come out!"</p><p></p><p>Soon, the fleet from the starry sky arrived above Silver Fox Valley.</p><p></p><p>"Forgive us, Wolf God, for not coming out to welcome you. We hope you will pardon our discourtesy."</p><p></p><p>The Fox Queen spoke first, standing behind the formations to communicate with the other side.</p><p></p><p>Under the starry sky, the few star beasts who had escaped from Silver Fox Valley shouted coldly, "Fox vixen, cut the act. Hurry up and hand over Lianruo Yutuo and Hesenzi!"</p><p></p><p>The Fox Queen's eyes flickered slightly. The others didn't know about the imperial inheritance? Thinking it over, she seemed to understand something.</p><p></p><p>That group had come before, just wanting to see if Silver Fox Valley had any treasures. But now that they were here, they must have gathered some information first.</p><p></p><p>And Mr. Ye was a very good target.</p><p></p><p>So they had set their sights on Mr. Ye.</p><p></p><p>The first one they sent out was Lianruo Yutuo, which was why she had quietly disappeared.</p><p></p><p>The next day, Hesenzi and the others wanted to investigate Mr. Ye, also for this reason.</p><p></p><p>They had known early on that Lianruo Yutuo had gone to find Mr. Ye, so in the end, they wanted to investigate Mr. Ye.</p><p></p><p>It's just that with her own people's obstruction, they didn't succeed.</p><p></p><p>Then Hesenzi went to find Mr. Ye at night, and the result was obvious - she was also sent packing.</p><p></p><p>After all, Mr. Ye was a half-Emperor Realm expert.</p><p></p><p>How could a few of them contend with such a powerful person?</p><p></p><p>This was also why the other star beasts had been so frightened and fled when they went on the third day.</p><p></p><p>They hadn't discovered the secrets of the imperial inheritance, they were just afraid.</p><p></p><p>So now they had brought the Wolf God.</p><p></p><p>Thinking of this, she took a deep breath and slowly spoke:</p><p></p><p>"Our Silver Fox Clan has not killed Lianruo Yutuo and Hesenzi.</p><p></p><p>In fact, it was Lianruo Yutuo and Hesenzi who stole something from our Silver Fox Clan and secretly fled. We of the Silver Fox Clan are also looking for the two of them."</p><p></p><p>This was of course a lie she had told, but it didn't matter. The other side didn't know whether it was true or false anyway, as long as it could delay time.</p><p></p><p>The star beasts suddenly paused.</p><p></p><p>Lianruo Yutuo and Hesenzi weren't dead? And they had even stolen something and fled? In an instant, several star beasts' faces turned icy cold.</p><p></p><p>"Damn it, we were actually fooled by them. It was in vain that we went to find the Wolf God to take revenge for them. Unexpectedly, those two little bitches were so despicable! They took the treasure and ran off."</p><p></p><p>"If I find them, I'll make sure they die a horrible death."</p><p></p><p>The Fox Queen heaved a sigh of relief. Fortunately, the scheme had succeeded. If the other side could leave, that would be the best.</p><p></p><p>The star beasts reported to the Wolf God.</p><p></p><p>"Wolf God, Lianruo Yutuo and Hesenzi have no morals at all. Please, Wolf God, you must uphold justice for us."</p><p></p><p>The Wolf God swept a glance at the star beasts and spoke indifferently, "Shut up, you bunch of idiots!"</p><p></p><p>The star beasts were scolded, left bewildered but dared not get angry, only suppressing it in their hearts.</p><p></p><p>As for the Wolf God, he turned his gaze to the Fox Queen.</p><p></p><p>"You say they stole your things?"</p><p></p><p>The Fox Queen's heart trembled. She didn't know why, but when she met the Wolf God's gaze, she felt as if she had been seen through.</p>

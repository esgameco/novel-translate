        <h1>Chapter 406</h1>
        <div class="content">
            <p>Here is the full English translation of the Chinese excerpt:</p><p></p><p>Wow, four divine king tombs have suddenly appeared! This is too terrifying! According to Ye Xiao's understanding of divine king tombs, the resources in a single divine king tomb, measured in billions of divine crystals, are incomparable.</p><p></p><p>This is because the resources in divine king tombs are not only extremely valuable, but many things are also extremely rare. It can be said that they are priceless, and you may not be able to buy them even if you have the money.</p><p></p><p>Ye Xiao obtained two divine king tombs, and he is now filthy rich, feeling that he has enough resources to support the entire Jiuzhou region with over 100 billion people for who knows how many years.</p><p></p><p>It's true that the cultivation bases of the Jiuzhou human race are generally quite poor, and the average person doesn't consume that many resources. </p><p></p><p>But don't forget, Jiuzhou has a total population of over 140 billion! This shows how many precious things must be contained in a single divine king tomb!</p><p></p><p>However, he feels that by the time he gets there, it might be too late.</p><p></p><p>Not every divine king tomb is like the Poison King Tomb. Most of them are probably like the Healing Master Tomb, where you can obtain the good things inside just by opening the formation.</p><p></p><p>Anyway.</p><p></p><p>In fact, he is no longer very interested in divine king tombs now.</p><p></p><p>The resources in a single divine king tomb are indeed extremely abundant, but they are still far inferior to the resources in the Divine Realm Treasure Vault.</p><p></p><p>In fact, not only the Divine Realm Treasure Vault, even the dragon vein outside the Divine Realm Treasure Vault is probably more valuable than the divine king tombs.</p><p></p><p>Ye Xiao's method of excavating the Divine Realm Treasure Vault is to dig a tunnel directly to the inside, rather than stripping all the divine crystals like peeling an egg.</p><p></p><p>That is to say, although he is still about 70% away from the Divine Realm Treasure Vault, the divine crystals he has dug up are only a drop in the bucket compared to the entire dragon vein, and are practically negligible.</p><p></p><p>Yet even with this, he has already excavated hundreds of billions of divine crystals.</p><p></p><p>So his interest in divine king tombs has already diminished.</p><p></p><p>The only thing in divine king tombs that can still pique his interest is the divine blood remnants within the divine kings' bodies.</p><p></p><p>If he can obtain those divine blood, it may allow him to further increase his cultivation by a level or two.</p><p></p><p>It won't be like before, when hundreds of millions of divine blood drops could instantly propel him up several levels in the Divine Realm.</p><p></p><p>After all, as his cultivation continues to rise, the amount of spiritual energy Ye Xiao needs for each breakthrough becomes greater and greater.</p><p></p><p>"Oh right, Senior Emperor, I have some good things here that I want to give you.</p><p></p><p>I originally wanted to give one to each of you, but I only have two, which is really not much. So I'll give you two first, you take one, and the other one can be given to the other seniors.</p><p></p><p>I'll send more to the other seniors once I've accumulated more."</p><p></p><p>Emperor smiled at the corners of his mouth.</p><p></p><p>"Okay! Then I won't be polite with you."</p><p></p><p>In the past, Emperor and the others would still try to save the resources for Ye Xiao, letting him use them to improve his strength.</p><p></p><p>But later they realized that Ye Xiao's resources were far more abundant than what they could provide.</p><p></p><p>Ye Xiao really didn't lack these things.</p><p></p><p>So now they don't bother being polite with Ye Xiao anymore.</p><p></p><p>Ye Xiao took the items out of his storage ring and directly transmitted them into Emperor's storage ring, so that others wouldn't discover them.</p><p></p><p>Emperor chuckled.</p><p></p><p>"Let me see what good things these are."</p><p></p><p>A moment later, Emperor: "(˙灬˙)!"</p><p></p><p>He looked at the two white jade coffins in his storage ring and fell into deep contemplation.</p><p></p><p>"I probably can't use these two things right now."</p><p></p><p>"But I'll be able to use them in the future."</p><p></p><p>"No, this Ye Xiao, although I'm not your elder or relative, I've still helped you a lot. Sending me coffins, isn't that a bit inappropriate?"</p><p></p><p>Ye Xiao waved his hand.</p><p></p><p>"You've misunderstood my intention.</p><p></p><p>These coffins are indeed for the dead, they can preserve one's body for tens of thousands of years without decay.</p><p></p><p>But in addition to this, they also have another special effect. That is, by cultivating while lying inside, the cultivation speed can also be increased significantly.</p><p></p><p>For me, the effect is no longer that great.</p><p></p><p>But for you all who haven't even stepped into the Divine Realm, the effect will still be very powerful!"</p><p></p><p>Emperor's eyes suddenly lit up, and he became interested.</p><p></p><p>"Oh? Really? Where did you get these things from?"</p><p></p><p>"I excavated two divine king tombs."</p><p></p><p>Emperor: "(˙灬˙)!"</p><p></p><p>Wow, just casually mentioning two divine king tombs.</p><p></p><p>If Emperor's memory serves him right, the XuanYuan Clan and the Hundred Tribes Alliance haven't even obtained a single divine king tomb before.</p><p></p><p>It's only now that these four divine king tombs have been found.</p><p></p><p>This is as difficult as ascending to the heavens.</p><p></p><p>Out of a million divine tombs, you may not even find one.</p><p></p><p>Ye Xiao is simply not human.</p><p></p><p>No wonder, even though he hasn't joined the XuanYuan Clan and has no background support, he has never lacked resources.</p><p></p><p>"Okay, I've said what I needed to say today, I'll head back first. There's still schoolwork to be done at the academy."</p><p></p><p>Ye Xiao nodded, and Emperor then left.</p><p></p><p>Before leaving, he glanced at Ye Xiao again and then left.</p><p></p><p>Here is the full English translation of the Chinese excerpt:</p><p></p><p>He sat down at the desk and started reading the book.</p><p></p><p>This evoked countless emotions within him.</p><p></p><p>It had been just over two years since the Divine Tribe's arrival, and before their arrival, he and Ye Xiao were both at the Emperor Realm, with only a slight gap between them.</p><p></p><p>But now, he felt like a primary school student in comparison.</p><p></p><p>Looking at Ye Xiao, he had already surpassed the young masters of the Xuanyuan Families, reaching the level that the young master of the Cloud Family, the number one among the younger generation of the Xuanyuan Tribe, paid attention to.</p><p></p><p>It could now be said without any politeness that Ye Xiao was the second among the younger generation of the Xuanyuan Tribe!</p><p></p><p>The gap was truly heaven and earth.</p><p></p><p>In the starry sky, the Xuanyuan Tribe and the Hundred Tribes Alliance had been excavating four Divine King Tombs for a full month.</p><p></p><p>They did not have Ye Xiao's level of array-breaking skills and methods, and every time they opened a Divine King Tomb, they would fight fiercely with each other over the resources.</p><p></p><p>In order to obtain the resources from these four Divine King Tombs, they had sacrificed countless lives.</p><p></p><p>But in the end, the resources they obtained were able to make up for these losses.</p><p></p><p>Only no one had noticed that the bodies of those who had died would mysteriously disappear from the starry sky battlefield.</p><p></p><p>After a month, the two major forces had completely stripped the four Divine King Tombs, not leaving a single soft hair behind.</p><p></p><p>The Xuanyuan Tribe had obtained the most resources, about two and a half Divine Tombs.</p><p></p><p>While the Hundred Tribes Alliance had obtained about one and a half Divine Tombs.</p><p></p><p>Now it was time to divide the spoils.</p><p></p><p>It was clear that the Xuanyuan Tribe had reaped a bountiful harvest, and it was said that even the students of the Academy, like the Emperor, had obtained a certain amount of cultivation resources.</p><p></p><p>During this one month, Ye Xiao's cultivation had also further advanced to the Slay God Realm Third Layer! Meanwhile, the excavation progress of the Divine National Treasure Vault had also reached 60%.</p><p></p><p>The tunnel still lacked the last 40% to reach the door of the Divine National Treasure Vault.</p><p></p><p>After all, this was largely thanks to the participation of the Silver Fox Clan. Their large numbers meant that the excavation of the divine crystals did not require strong strength, but rather a large workforce and endless labor.</p><p></p><p>Ye Xiao estimated that at this rate, it would take at most four more months for him to completely excavate the divine crystals and enter the Divine National Treasure Vault.</p><p></p><p>He wondered what kind of treasures would be inside the Divine National Treasure Vault? Would he be able to greatly improve his cultivation at that time?</p><p></p><p>That day, he continued reading, and managed to cultivate a new body technique divine art - the Spatial Heavenly Escape!</p><p></p><p>This was the second body technique divine art he had obtained after the Yin-Yang Heavenly Escape.</p><p></p><p>What surprised Ye Xiao was that this time, it did not require the combination of other types of divine arts, but could be directly self-synthesized.</p><p></p><p>This was quite novel. After all, so far, all the divine arts Ye Xiao had encountered required the synthesis of multiple types of divine arts to form the ancient precious art.</p><p></p><p>The body technique class was currently the only one that could be synthesized solely based on its own source arts.</p><p></p><p>After cultivating it to the Great Perfection Realm, Ye Xiao clicked to synthesize it and then left it there, waiting for the golden book to complete the final synthesis.</p><p></p><p>It was already near the end of the workday, and Ye Xiao heard his colleagues in the library discussing not far away: "This time, our Xuanyuan Tribe really made a huge profit, obtaining a lot of good things."</p><p></p><p>"That's right, several major families came down from the starry sky and distributed a large batch of precious resources. My second aunt's daughter-in-law, who is in the Martial Arts Academy, has good talent and suddenly obtained hundreds of divine crystals! And she's just an ordinary student, far inferior to other students with higher talents, but she still got so many resources."</p><p></p><p>"That's nothing! Although the resources the Ning Family gave to the Martial Arts Academy were not few, in reality, that was just a drop in the bucket. I heard that the Ning Family brought back many coffins from the starry sky, and the treasures inside are probably countless!"</p><p></p><p>Regarding these matters, Ye Xiao also listened carefully.</p><p></p><p>He was not particularly interested in those resources, he just wanted to know if anyone would investigate the news about the Divine National Treasure Vault. Aside from that, the rest had little impact on him.</p><p></p><p>But for now, it seemed very stable, and he had not heard anyone discussing the Divine National Treasure Vault.</p><p></p><p>Soon it was time to get off work, and Ye Xiao went straight home. On the way, he saw Gu Hai and his teammates dressed and heading out of the city.</p><p></p><p>"Old Ye!"</p><p></p><p>Gu Hai saw him and waved, greeting him.</p><p></p><p>Ye Xiao asked, "Why are you all out so late? Are you going on a mission?"</p><p></p><p>Gu Hai replied, "There's a small incident in a village outside the city. Probably some star beasts causing trouble, killing the chickens, ducks and geese that the villagers were raising. We're going to take a look."</p><p></p><p>Ye Xiao nodded. Star beasts' living space was now very small, so if they were extremely hungry, they might steal some livestock. But the star beasts that would steal livestock were probably not too strong.</p><p></p><p>"I see. Be careful. If you can't handle something, feel free to contact me."</p><p></p><p>"Okay, since you said that, I won't hold back if I need your help."</p><p></p><p>(End of chapter)</p>

        <h1>Chapter 225</h1>
        <div class="content">
            <p>Here is the full English translation of the Chinese excerpt:</p><p></p><p>Two figures gathered in the mountain valley, emanating a faint aura of murderous intent.</p><p></p><p>As the gentle breeze blew, the sea of forests surged, reflecting dazzling ripples under the sun, as if it could swallow anything that fell from the sky.</p><p></p><p>"The human race has discovered our movements. In the Central State, they have already started to purge the tiger demons within the cities. My subordinates have been mostly wiped out, and the remaining ones won't last much longer."</p><p></p><p>"The beastmen are in a similar situation. The Beastgod Alliance, the strongest beastman organization in the Nine Realms, has been completely destroyed by the human race.</p><p></p><p>What's left are just a few scattered remnants, too weak to be of any consequence."</p><p></p><p>"The human race is truly ruthless, they are trying to drive us to extinction!</p><p></p><p>We've put in so much effort over the years, finally establishing a good foothold in the human world, but unexpectedly, in the blink of an eye, we've been almost completely annihilated by the human race. It's truly frustrating."</p><p></p><p>"The situation has become set in stone, no need to dwell on it further. The beast calamity is imminent, so what we should do now is try to undermine the overall strength of the human race.</p><p></p><p>The tiger demon operations and the beastman actions have almost been completely crushed.</p><p></p><p>Relying on these subordinates won't work, so we should quickly increase the strength of our high-level alliance.</p><p></p><p>In the Central State City, there are several Celestial Beast Sovereigns sealed, one of which has already reached the Pseudo-Deity Realm, just a step away from becoming a true Deity Realm expert.</p><p></p><p>If we can rescue it, it will be a huge boost to our efforts in undermining the human race's powerhouses."</p><p></p><p>"The Central State City, huh?"</p><p></p><p>A flash of cruelty appeared in the eyes of the Celestial Beast Sovereign, murderous intent surging forth.</p><p></p><p>"Perfect, the ones who have been interfering with my plans are just a few humans. I'll go there and torment them, venting my pent-up resentment."</p><p></p><p>The other Celestial Beast Sovereign, though not fully agreeing, still spoke up:</p><p></p><p>"Be careful, don't go overboard. The Central State City is guarded by Celestial Sovereign-level human experts.</p><p></p><p>If we're not cautious, we might end up perishing in the Central State City, which would be a huge loss.</p><p></p><p>We've barely escaped from the Shaolin Temple, so we must act prudently.</p><p></p><p>Noel Fis has gone to the Jianghai City to search for his split body, and he should be back soon.</p><p></p><p>When he returns, the four of us can attack the Central State City together, ensuring complete success."</p><p></p><p>"Don't worry, I'll just deal with those two or three humans. Surely there won't be any Celestial Sovereign-level experts among them, hehe..."</p><p></p><p>On Ye Xiao's side, after a day of classes, he had learned quite a bit.</p><p></p><p>After school, as the professor who had been teaching just left the classroom, Ye Xiao quietly followed him.</p><p></p><p>"Professor Huang, please wait a moment."</p><p></p><p>Professor Huang stopped and pushed up his glasses, recognizing Ye Xiao.</p><p></p><p>"You're Ye, right?"</p><p></p><p>Ye Xiao nodded.</p><p></p><p>"What can I do for you?"</p><p></p><p>"Well, I'd like to visit the Martial Arts Library in the Central State, but since I'm an outsider, I'm only allowed on the first and second floors. I was wondering if Professor Huang could help me gain access to the upper floors."</p><p></p><p>Professor Huang showed a look of satisfaction.</p><p></p><p>"You have such an aspiration? That's wonderful! The youth these days are often too impulsive, but it's rare to find someone as diligent as you. I'll help you with this."</p><p></p><p>He then took out a card from his briefcase and handed it to Ye Xiao.</p><p></p><p>"This is a card for the professors of the Central State Martial Arts University. I don't need to use the library recently, so you can use it for a few days."</p><p></p><p>"Thank you, Professor Huang."</p><p></p><p>"Haha, no need to thank me. You young people are the pillars of the future, and as an old man, I'm just doing my part to contribute to the country."</p><p></p><p>With that, Professor Huang took his leave, and Ye Xiao looked at the card in his hand with a slight smile.</p><p></p><p>Although the Martial Arts Library in the Central State had many techniques, this also led to an abundance of techniques with the same origin.</p><p></p><p>Like yesterday, after searching for a long time, Ye Xiao had only found a gaze technique and a few soul cultivation methods, which were barely enough to fill the gaps.</p><p></p><p>The higher-level techniques were all on the upper floors, so if he could filter out a large number of the basic techniques with the same origin, his efficiency would improve significantly.</p><p></p><p>Additionally, the gaze techniques and soul cultivation methods were inherently the rarest, so even the Central State Martial Arts Library couldn't have too many of them on the lower floors.</p><p></p><p>Therefore, he had to go to the upper floors of the library no matter what.</p><p></p><p>With Professor Huang's card in hand, Ye Xiao immediately headed to the library.</p><p></p><p>He had calculated that his morning classes were the only fixed schedule, and the afternoons were free time, so he could spend that time in the library before it closed in the evening, searching for and selecting more techniques.</p><p></p><p>Arriving at the library, Ye Xiao used the card to directly go up to the third floor.</p><p></p><p>The number of people on the third floor was already much fewer than the first two floors, but it was still quite crowded, as the population base of the Central State City was simply too large.</p><p></p><p>Ye Xiao then went up to the fourth floor, where the number of people finally started to decrease to a manageable level, and he chose to start his studies there.</p><p></p><p>Here is the full English translation of the Chinese excerpt:</p><p></p><p>Ye Xiao's idea was correct.</p><p></p><p>The cultivation methods on the fourth layer were basically at the level of the extraordinary and even had a few rare grandmaster-level cultivation methods.</p><p></p><p>These cultivation methods were often fewer in number because they were more complex, had higher writing requirements, and were difficult to find. Similarly, there were not many places where their origins were the same.</p><p></p><p>In just half a day, Ye Xiao had specifically searched for soul-refining techniques and found three of them, which he then absorbed into his body. This speed was very fast, even though he could only look for half a day each time, the gains he reaped were quite abundant.</p><p></p><p>After about a week, Ye Xiao had finally gathered all the soul-refining techniques.</p><p></p><p>After cultivating all the cultivation methods to the great perfection realm, Ye Xiao finally began the fusion.</p><p></p><p>He returned to the hotel, locked the door, and closed all the windows and curtains tightly.</p><p></p><p>Then he took out the golden book spirit and began to fuse the soul-refining techniques.</p><p></p><p>If he could learn the soul-refining techniques, his future breakthrough to the King Realm would be as easy as his previous breakthrough from the Innate Fifth Grade to the Innate Sixth Grade, basically a smooth sailing.</p><p></p><p>He could just sit on a small stool and wait for the breakthrough.</p><p></p><p>The golden book emitted a golden glow, illuminating the entire room, and the cultivation methods gradually formed one large character after another.</p><p></p><p>".!"</p><p></p><p>".!"</p><p></p><p>".!"</p><p></p><p>Ye Xiao: "(_..)!"</p><p></p><p>Wow, this time the characters, could it be that even the golden book itself was embarrassed to write them out? What kind of characters were these that could be so vulgar?</p><p></p><p>Soon, the golden book had completed the fusion of the cultivation method.</p><p></p><p>Immortal and Indestructible!</p><p></p><p>Ye Xiao: "(_..)!"</p><p></p><p>Another very crappy name, this golden book, it was really beyond saving when it came to naming.</p><p></p><p>Could it be that the previous few characters were not because they were too vulgar, but because the cultural level of this golden book was actually quite poor, so it couldn't even write the characters properly just now?</p><p></p><p>Unfortunately, the golden book couldn't speak, otherwise he could have asked it what the situation was. At this time, the cultivation method had already started to cultivate on its own, and Ye Xiao took a glance, and surprisingly, although the golden book was a naming waste, the cultivation method it provided was truly extraordinary.</p><p></p><p>Immortal and Indestructible, the soul never dies, the flesh never perishes, coexisting with heaven and earth!</p><p></p><p>Awesome, utterly awesome!</p><p></p><p>With this cultivation method, Ye Xiao even began to feel that his soul was constantly growing stronger.</p><p></p><p>In the past, although he had cultivated the Taixuan Tiangong, the Taixuan Tiangong was only used to enhance his spiritual power, and spiritual power was the power stored within the soul. It could not make the soul power itself become much stronger, at most it would only have a little effect.</p><p></p><p>But now, this enhancement could be truly felt.</p><p></p><p>The difference between the two was like the difference between a cookie and a carrot.</p><p></p><p>Although the hardness was not much different, the range of expansion was different, and the experience brought was also very different.</p><p></p><p>Could a cookie feel anything? It definitely could, but the feeling was too small, like an ant crawling, so naturally it was as good as having no feeling at all.</p><p></p><p>The carrot?</p><p></p><p>Just looking at the bright red color, it made one's mouth water and unable to resist the urge to take a bite.</p><p></p><p>It was definitely different! And Immortal and Indestructible had not even been fully cultivated yet. When it reached the great perfection realm, the scene would be like a surging river, unstoppable! Perfect!</p><p></p><p>"After a week of effort, it was not in vain. The soul-refining technique has been completed, and the next thing to consider should be the eye technique and the leg technique. The leg technique can be learned back in Jianghai City, let's learn the eye technique first."</p><p></p><p>Just as Ye Xiao had set his next goal, his phone suddenly rang.</p><p></p><p>He took out his phone, and the caller ID displayed the number of the Central State Garrison.</p><p></p><p>Ye Xiao answered the call.</p><p></p><p>"Hello?"</p><p></p><p>"Is this Mr. Ye Xiao?"</p><p></p><p>"Yes, it's me. What's the matter?"</p><p></p><p>"We received a report here. It seems that the girl you rescued from Tiger Xing a week ago has gone missing. We wanted to ask if you've been in contact with her since then?"</p><p></p><p>"No! We just happened to cross paths, so naturally there has been no contact at all. What's wrong?"</p><p></p><p>"Nothing, her family said she's been missing for two or three days, and they've come to report it. Since you haven't been in contact, then we'll hang up first."</p><p></p><p>"Okay."</p><p></p><p>Ye Xiao lightly responded, and the sound of the call being disconnected came from the other end.</p><p></p><p>Ye Xiao tossed the phone onto the bed, vaguely feeling a bit irritated.</p><p></p><p>Since cultivating to the Ninth Grade, his perception of his surroundings had deepened, and sometimes unpleasant feelings would quietly come to his heart.</p><p></p><p>And every time he had such a feeling, he would encounter trouble.</p><p></p><p>3 AM, 9,000 words.</p><p></p><p>Please recommend, vote, and subscribe.</p><p></p><p>Thank you to the readers Jiu Fei, Ci Wei 0 Sonic, and Ren Zai Wutong Xia for your donations, I'm deeply grateful.</p><p></p><p>Thank you to every supporting reader, you are all the most beloved to me!</p><p></p><p>Continuing to type.</p><p></p><p>(This chapter is complete)</p>

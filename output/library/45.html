        <h1>Chapter 45</h1>
        <div class="content">
            <p>Here is my translation of the Chinese excerpt:</p><p></p><p>Huan Liuli regained consciousness from her daze, and what came into view was the rippling blue sea and the scorching sun. </p><p></p><p>A sea breeze that was strong enough to darken one's skin was blowing incessantly beside her.</p><p></p><p>And she was lying on a plastic board.</p><p></p><p>Huan Liuli: "???"</p><p></p><p>"Am I dreaming? Wasn't I just getting my butt spanked by Ye Xiao? How did I end up in the sea? It seems that in these past few days, I've been so badly beaten by Ye Xiao that I'm now hallucinating! All day long it's either doing laundry, mopping the floor, or guarding the door. I'm not a dog! When have cats ever guarded the house? What about the dog? Ah well, might as well sleep a bit more."</p><p></p><p>Closing her eyes, Huan Liuli was just about to doze off again, when suddenly, accompanied by a splashing sound, a wave surged over and drenched her completely, turning her into a dripping wet cat.</p><p></p><p>Huan Liuli was now fully awake, and her hackles immediately raised.</p><p></p><p>"Meow - ! Am I really out at sea? Where's Ye Xiao? The sofa? Meow meow meow meow! Help, I can't swim!"</p><p></p><p>On Ye Xiao's side, after resting for a night, he received a WeChat message from Gu Hai.</p><p></p><p>"Old Ye, I'm back, getting checked up at the Second Hospital, don't worry."</p><p></p><p>Ye Xiao didn't show much surprise, as he had already known that Gu Hai was safe.</p><p></p><p>The library's work group had sent a message saying the library would be closed for three days for renovations.</p><p></p><p>Today it was drizzling outside, so Ye Xiao went out, had breakfast, bought some fruit and milk, and headed straight for the Second Hospital.</p><p></p><p>The returning defense team members all had private rooms, with other defense team members guarding the outside 24 hours a day, to prevent any abnormalities. Only after being checked and confirmed as not posing a threat would they be allowed to leave.</p><p></p><p>When Ye Xiao arrived at Gu Hai's ward, Qin Yuyan and Lu Wanwan were also there. Gu Hai, in a hospital gown, was comforting the red-eyed Lu Wanwan.</p><p></p><p>"Wife, I'm really fine, look, all my parts are intact, not even a single hair is missing. Stop crying, be good~."</p><p></p><p>Ye Xiao walked in, and Lu Wanwan felt a bit embarrassed, immediately turning her head away and wiping the corners of her eyes with her sleeve.</p><p></p><p>Qin Yuyan tucked the strands of hair behind her ear and smiled gently, greeting him.</p><p></p><p>"You're here too."</p><p></p><p>Ye Xiao nodded.</p><p></p><p>He placed the fruit and milk aside.</p><p></p><p>"How are you? No injuries?"</p><p></p><p>"No injuries, I'm doing great, the food is delicious, the doctors said I'm fine, but Wanwan still doesn't believe it and keeps crying."</p><p></p><p>"She's just worried about you. But you, going on a mission without saying a word, not even making a phone call home."</p><p></p><p>"I wanted to call, but my phone got lost during the battle, and later all the electronic devices were signal-jammed, so I had no way to contact anyone."</p><p></p><p>Ye Xiao's expression remained unchanged, and he didn't bring up the matter of the text message either, just calmly saying:</p><p></p><p>"Before you left, I told you not to be reckless, and to retreat if the situation was bad. Looks like you even managed to lose your phone."</p><p></p><p>"How could I have known it would be so dangerous? But this time, I'm really grateful to that powerful person in Jianghai City, if it weren't for him, I might not have made it back."</p><p></p><p>"Seems like you got lucky."</p><p></p><p>At this point, Lu Wanwan felt nauseous, and Qin Yuyan said worriedly:</p><p></p><p>"I'll take Wanwan downstairs to have a look, you two chat here."</p><p></p><p>"Okay!"</p><p></p><p>After the two women left, Gu Hai said mysteriously:</p><p></p><p>"Old Ye, when the girls were here just now, I couldn't really say it. Guess what I heard when I was on the brink of death?"</p><p></p><p>Ye Xiao shook his head.</p><p></p><p>"I don't know."</p><p></p><p>"It'll shock you - your voice!"</p><p></p><p>"Have you gone crazy?"</p><p></p><p>Ye Xiao had a look of bewilderment, while Gu Hai just chuckled.</p><p></p><p>"Isn't that something? At that time, my spiritual power was infected, and my consciousness was blurred! But I didn't hallucinate any voices of Wanwan or my parents, not even Red Langman Ari's voice, the only one I heard was yours!"</p><p></p><p>Here is the full English translation of the excerpt from the Chinese novel:</p><p></p><p>"What does this mean? It means that my feelings for you are truly brotherly, as deep as the ocean. You are even closer to me than a real brother!"</p><p></p><p>"Don't be so sappy, okay? It's making me sick to listen to."</p><p></p><p>"What are you afraid of? Big bro Hai won't do anything to you, I'll just hold you while we sleep, I won't even poke you."</p><p></p><p>"Screw off."</p><p></p><p>"Haha haha..."</p><p></p><p>After laughing for a little while, Gu Hai's tone started to become more somber, his eyes slightly reddening.</p><p></p><p>"Old Ye, don't mind me, I've been holding it in for so long, I had to say some nonsense to crack a joke, or else I might not be able to hold it in."</p><p></p><p>Ye Xiao didn't say much more. He knew that Gu Hai was bearing an immense amount of pressure inside, and the earlier exaggeration was just a facade.</p><p></p><p>After all, he not only went through the Gates of Hell, but also lost several of his teammates.</p><p></p><p>"Do you have any cigarettes?"</p><p></p><p>"I hid two packs of Zhonghua in the fruit bag I bought you earlier."</p><p></p><p>"You really do know me well, knowing the hospital wouldn't let me smoke, so you snuck those in for me."</p><p></p><p>Gu Hai took out the cigarette pack, but after thinking about it, he put the cigarettes back.</p><p></p><p>"Old Li liked to smoke, he was torn apart by the tiger beasts and star beasts while protecting me. If I smoke, I'll be disrespecting him."</p><p></p><p>He wiped the corner of his eye and continued:</p><p></p><p>"I'm not afraid of you laughing at me, but at that time, I even peed my pants. </p><p></p><p>Before the mission, I thought it wouldn't be much different from what's shown on TV, but when I actually experienced it, I realized how dangerous it was.</p><p></p><p>I was thinking then, if I hadn't wasted so much time and trained diligently all these years, if I had advanced my cultivation by a few more levels, I might have been able to protect a teammate or two during the battle, instead of becoming a burden dragging others down.</p><p></p><p>But the reality is, I'm just too useless. Not only did I not contribute much, I even got Old Li killed.</p><p></p><p>The one who should have died is me."</p><p></p><p>"The important thing is that you're alive."</p><p></p><p>Ye Xiao comforted him with a sentence, but Gu Hai shook his head, blew his nose, and his eyes revealed a maturity that Ye Xiao had never seen in him before.</p><p></p><p>"I never understood before why the global defense teams are constantly losing people, but everyone still rushes to join them. What are they fighting for? Now I understand.</p><p></p><p>The defense teams exist to protect. </p><p></p><p>It is because of the defense teams that the common people, our families and descendants, can live in peace and security! I'm over 20 now, I can't just drift through life anymore.</p><p></p><p>Old Ye, I'm going to join the special training camp, I need to train hard and become a true man who can defend his country!"</p><p></p><p>"The special training camp is very tough."</p><p></p><p>"Then I'll go through it! I have a wife and child, I have to contribute my part to this world! As long as we men do our best, our wives and children can live safely!"</p><p></p><p>Ye Xiao nodded.</p><p></p><p>"Since you have this determination, I wish you success."</p><p></p><p>"Thank you. But don't tell Xiao Wan about this yet, I'm afraid she won't agree."</p><p></p><p>"Don't worry."</p><p></p><p>The two exchanged a few more pleasantries, and it was only after Qin Yuyan and Lu Wanwan returned that Ye Xiao took his leave.</p><p></p><p>Walking out of the hospital, the light drizzle was still falling, but Ye Xiao did not use his spiritual energy to shield himself, letting the rain soak his clothes.</p><p></p><p>Gu Hai's words had loosened the bottleneck Ye Xiao had been unable to break through in his martial dao.</p><p></p><p>What is the meaning of the martial dao? To become stronger, but for what purpose? For fun? For fame? To display one's might and make all submit? No! These are not the reasons.</p><p></p><p>An unnamed wave of emotion began to slowly spread from Ye Xiao's body.</p><p></p><p>(End of chapter)</p>

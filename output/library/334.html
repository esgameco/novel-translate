        <h1>Chapter 334</h1>
        <div class="content">
            <p>Here is the full English translation of the Chinese excerpt:</p><p></p><p>On Ye Xiao's side, following what Emperor Jing had said, he released all the martial artists from the Nine Prefectures who were sealed inside the Seal of the Emperor. Then, he immediately used the Yin-Yang Escape Technique to return to the dormitory in the library.</p><p></p><p>Ning Yuhen and Youwei were not there, they should have each found a room to stay in.</p><p></p><p>Only Huan Liuli was lying on the bed, her arms and legs spread out in a 'big' shape.</p><p></p><p>The moonlight poured in through the window, crossing over the high hills, illuminating her body. The pure white stockings under the moonlight were as thin as cicada wings, completely unable to cover the delicate little toes inside.</p><p></p><p>Ye Xiao was quite speechless, and covered her with a blanket.</p><p></p><p>Huan Liuli smacked her lips and let out a few giggly murmurs.</p><p></p><p>"Mm, no, that's yucky, go wash it clean."</p><p></p><p>Ye Xiao shook his head helplessly.</p><p></p><p>The little kitten has grown up, it seems time to find her a tomcat.</p><p></p><p>However, the next moment, Ye Xiao heard Huan Liuli speak again:</p><p></p><p>"Master, you're so naughty."</p><p></p><p>Ye Xiao: "(_..)! "</p><p></p><p>Damn, what kind of dream is this fool of a cat having? Oh well, there's no time to deal with her right now, the main matter is more important.</p><p></p><p>The divine-grade sword technique 'Crack the Earth' that he cultivated within his body had already reached the Great Perfection realm.</p><p></p><p>But the Golden Book did not show any indication of being able to synthesize it.</p><p></p><p>Clearly, just like before, it was because his cultivation had not yet reached the required level.</p><p></p><p>Thinking about it carefully, it made sense. The divine-grade technique was already a cultivation beyond his level for him.</p><p></p><p>If he were to further synthesize the divine-grade technique to create an even more powerful one, he definitely wouldn't be able to control it at his current level.</p><p></p><p>Rome wasn't built in a day, and the path is not completed in a single step. Slowly, step by step.</p><p></p><p>The main issue he currently needed to focus on was cultivating his foundation.</p><p></p><p>The technique was one aspect, but he didn't know what the Xuanyuan Clan people who came to this world would choose to do. Ye Xiao felt that since the Nine Prefectures people were their descendants, they wouldn't treat them too harshly.</p><p></p><p>At least they wouldn't kill them or take them back as slaves.</p><p></p><p>Ye Xiao felt there were two possibilities, he just didn't know which one.</p><p></p><p>Would they take them away, or impart some techniques to them? If it was the former, he could consider using the storage ring to take some books from the library, then go to the Xuanyuan Clan's territory to see if he could extract more Emperor-grade techniques from their techniques to fuse with his remaining Emperor-grade techniques, upgrading them to more divine-grade ones!</p><p></p><p>If it was the latter, that would be even better. He could directly obtain some powerful techniques from them to fuse.</p><p></p><p>If the other party treated them poorly, he could also choose to first find a place to hide, then use the first method to supplement himself and secretly improve his cultivation.</p><p></p><p>With the level of the Golden Book's divine spirit, Ye Xiao believed that his strength would one day rise to a realm that could rival the Xuanyuan Clan.</p><p></p><p>By then, he could be a little more at ease.</p><p></p><p>However, aside from this, there was one more thing.</p><p></p><p>That was cultivation resources.</p><p></p><p>Techniques were only a part of cultivation resources, not the entirety.</p><p></p><p>A larger part of cultivation resources referred to things like elixirs, blood-rich beast meats, etc.</p><p></p><p>Since Emperor Jing also had some concerns and was uncertain how the Xuanyuan Clan would treat them, he decided to have Ye Xiao hide himself first and not overly expose his identity.</p><p></p><p>In the initial stage, he definitely wouldn't be able to obtain too many resources.</p><p></p><p>Fortunately, with this wave of beast calamity, he had captured many Supernal Realm experts, so he could happily replenish his blood qi in the future.</p><p></p><p>But this also brought up a new problem - his spirit beasts could no longer be kept under the library.</p><p></p><p>There were many experts in the Clan, they would definitely be discovered.</p><p></p><p>That would be a big trouble.</p><p></p><p>And his spiritual herbs, where should he place them? Storing them all in his storage ring wouldn't work.</p><p></p><p>Because the spatial range of his storage ring was far from enough for these spirit beasts to live in.</p><p></p><p>He needed an extremely large storage space.</p><p></p><p>Ye Xiao carefully thought it through, and silently took out the Seal of the Emperor given to him by Emperor Cloud.</p><p></p><p>Wasn't this a huge storage space? And now it was his, he could use it however he wanted.</p><p></p><p>When he had released the martial artists from the Nine Prefectures before, Ye Xiao had noticed that the space inside this jade seal was very large, far larger than his spatial storage ring.</p><p></p><p>It could even be said that it was like a small world, comparable to a small state.</p><p></p><p>This made Ye Xiao slightly puzzled and curious.</p><p></p><p>Were all the treasures of the Clan this powerful?</p><p></p><p>A spatial storage device could have such a huge effect, then who knows how formidable the other treasures would be?</p><p></p><p>However, Ye Xiao was not certain about the ranking of this item in the Clan.</p><p></p><p>Perhaps it was something the Xuanyuan ancestors had painstakingly found from somewhere, and not an ordinary spatial storage device.</p><p></p><p>Tonight, he would first set up the spirit beast breeding ground.</p><p></p><p>Thinking of this, Ye Xiao gathered all his spiritual herbs and stored them inside the Seal of the Emperor.</p><p></p><p>Then, he used the Yin-Yang Escape Technique to go to the spirit beast breeding ground under the library, and moved all those spirit beasts...</p><p></p><p>Here is the full English translation of the Chinese excerpt:</p><p></p><p>Capturing the jade seal.</p><p></p><p>The star beasts had not even had time to react when, in the blink of an eye, the surrounding environment had changed.</p><p></p><p>"Where is this place?"</p><p>"Yeah, I've never been here before."</p><p></p><p>Ye Xiao cleared his throat and spoke up.</p><p></p><p>"From today on, this will be the new star beast breeding ground. From now on, you will live and move about here, and you are not allowed to run around freely. I will set a certain range for you."</p><p></p><p>Afterwards, Ye Xiao set up several formations.</p><p></p><p>He separated the star beasts according to their cultivation levels.</p><p></p><p>The divine monarchs were placed together.</p><p>The divine beasts were placed together.</p><p>The super divine beasts were placed together.</p><p></p><p>Heaven knows, when Ye Xiao brought out the super divine beasts, the hearts of the other star beasts were completely shattered.</p><p></p><p>What was going on? Even the super divine beasts had been captured by Ye Xiao?</p><p></p><p>Had something gone wrong? </p><p>Was he joking with them?</p><p></p><p>Those were the mighty super divine beasts, the most powerful existence among the star beasts!</p><p></p><p>Yet they had also been captured by Ye Xiao. Just how strong was Ye Xiao's strength?</p><p></p><p>At this moment, some of the divine monarch star beasts even couldn't help but start to cry mournfully.</p><p>It wasn't that they had fallen into utter despair, but they were simply too heartbroken to hold back their tears.</p><p></p><p>Ye Xiao finished building the cages, and then revived the super divine star beasts.</p><p></p><p>The super divine star beasts looked at him busily locking them all up in the formations, their expressions blank and dazed.</p><p></p><p>"Why don't you just kill us? Why did you revive us again?"</p><p></p><p>One of the star beasts being locked up by Ye Xiao couldn't hold back his curiosity and asked.</p><p></p><p>Ye Xiao replied calmly, "Of course it's to use you as livestock and poultry."</p><p></p><p>The super divine star beasts: "（⊙.⊙）!"</p><p></p><p>Their expressions were completely frozen.</p><p></p><p>At this moment, they simply couldn't believe the words they had heard.</p><p></p><p>Ye Xiao actually said he was going to use them as livestock and poultry?</p><p></p><p>What kind of cosmic joke was this? Who were they? They were the super divine star beasts, the formidable enemies of the human realm! How could they tolerate being enslaved by humans? Even if this human's strength surpassed theirs, they would still refuse to submit.</p><p></p><p>"Human, I warn you. Either kill us directly or let us go. But you absolutely cannot disgrace our dignity as super divine star beasts. Our dignity is not something you can trample on as you please!"</p><p></p><p>Ye Xiao glanced at him, then said to the other super divine star beasts in a soft voice:</p><p></p><p>"If anyone doesn't behave, don't blame me for being unkind.</p><p>Urine! Super-strength spicy pepper water up the nose, one by one, I guarantee a full supply, not a single one will be missed."</p><p></p><p>The other star beasts who had wanted to join in the ruckus immediately quieted down, unable to say a word.</p><p></p><p>The super divine star beast who had spoken up earlier hurriedly shouted, "You cowards! What are you afraid of? Are you really going to submit to this damned human cultivator?"</p><p></p><p>"Where is the pride of the star beasts? The pride of the super divine star beasts?"</p><p></p><p>The other star beasts heard these words and couldn't help but have their expressions change slightly.</p><p>But not a single one spoke up.</p><p></p><p>It wasn't that they were cowards. If they fought Ye Xiao, even if they were killed, they wouldn't be afraid. At worst, they would just die.</p><p></p><p>What they feared was not being able to die, and being humiliated by Ye Xiao in even more insulting ways.</p><p></p><p>Seeing the other star beasts not even daring to fart, this one star beast immediately got anxious and shouted loudly, "Where are you people? Speak up! Why is it that not a single one of you can even let out a fart? Speak up! You are all traitors, traitors! I despise you all!"</p><p></p><p>Before the words had even finished, Ye Xiao had already delivered a resounding slap.</p><p></p><p>Slap! The crisp and loud sound of the palm strike instantly knocked the star beast unconscious.</p><p></p><p>Seeing this scene, the other super divine star beasts fell into even deeper silence.</p><p></p><p>Ye Xiao knew that taming them would not be possible in the short term.</p><p></p><p>These super divine beasts were originally a group of semi-divine existences at the pinnacle of the star beasts. </p><p>Later, after absorbing a large amount of divine blood from the human realm, they had undergone a tremendous advancement and become super divine star beasts! But before they could even enjoy the benefits, they had been captured by him to be used as livestock. Even their strong mentality wouldn't be able to withstand this.</p><p></p><p>Slowly, slowly.</p><p></p><p>Not all star beasts were being raised by Ye Xiao. Those that looked unappetizing and completely unappetizing, like bats, he simply couldn't stomach.</p><p>Those things would be left for later use in alchemy.</p><p></p><p>In addition to the star beasts, the various heavenly materials and earthly treasures had also been transferred here by Ye Xiao.</p><p></p><p>The heavenly materials and earthly treasures were used to cultivate the star beasts, to ensure that the star beasts could continue to improve with him and provide him with supplementary cultivation in the future.</p><p></p><p>(This chapter ends)</p>

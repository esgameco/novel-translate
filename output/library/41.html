            <p>Here is the full English translation of the Chinese excerpt:</p><p></p><p>An hour later, Huan Liuli looked at the clothes hanging in the courtyard and fell into deep contemplation.</p><p></p><p>"He is so strong! At this rate, can our family really defeat him even after two hundred years?"</p><p></p><p>After a long silence, her gaze became serious again.</p><p></p><p>"No! Our family is the Illusion Cat! We are a dragon-level bloodline beast, how can we be defeated like this?"</p><p></p><p>She went to the kitchen and rummaged out an unopened box of cookies.</p><p></p><p>"These cookies, if I remember correctly, were the ones Ye Xiao specially went to the supermarket to buy during the last big sale, but he never had the heart to eat them."</p><p></p><p>Soon, the corners of her mouth curled up into a mischievous smile.</p><p></p><p>"Let's see what I can add to spice them up."</p><p></p><p>Huan Liuli opened the cookies and took a whiff of them.</p><p></p><p>"They smell so good, this stinky Ye Xiao, he really has a mouth that loves to eat, he knows nothing but eating delicious things every day."</p><p></p><p>The next day, Huan Liuli woke up from her dream, and Ye Xiao was eating breakfast.</p><p></p><p>Huan Liuli's eyes lit up, Ye Xiao's breakfast today was cookies and milk, and the cookies were the same box from last night.</p><p></p><p>"Ye Xiao, today is your day! Hahaha, how are the cookies I prepared for you? Aren't they delicious?"</p><p></p><p>She hummed a little tune as she walked over and sat down next to Ye Xiao.</p><p></p><p>"Master, the cookies taste good, don't they?"</p><p></p><p>Ye Xiao nodded and pointed to the plate in front of her.</p><p></p><p>"Hurry up and eat your breakfast, you're going to be late for work."</p><p></p><p>"Okay."</p><p></p><p>Huan Liuli reached out and opened the box, picked up a cookie, and ate it greedily.</p><p></p><p>After finishing, she licked her lips with lingering satisfaction.</p><p></p><p>"These cookies are really delicious, next time we should buy more."</p><p></p><p>"You won't be able to get them next time."</p><p></p><p>"Why?"</p><p></p><p>"The ones you ate were the limited edition vanilla flavor, the factory won't produce them anymore."</p><p></p><p>Huan Liuli: "???"</p><p></p><p>She picked up the box with her small tender hands, looking puzzled.</p><p></p><p>"Isn't this box the same? Is there a difference?"</p><p></p><p>Ye Xiao said calmly, "This morning I saw there was only one box of vanilla cookies left, not enough for both of us, so I went and bought a new box, but they didn't have the vanilla flavor, so I bought the milk flavor instead. The packaging is the same."</p><p></p><p>Huan Liuli's small frame suddenly shuddered violently.</p><p></p><p>"So you're saying that what I ate was the leftover box from yesterday, and what you're eating is the new box you bought this morning?"</p><p></p><p>Ye Xiao nodded seriously.</p><p></p><p>"I'm eating the milk flavor, and I left the limited edition vanilla flavor for you. Aren't you touched?"</p><p></p><p>"Ugh!"</p><p></p><p>Huan Liuli transformed into a bolt of lightning and quickly rushed to the bathroom, vomiting.</p><p></p><p>Ye Xiao couldn't help but raise his eyebrows slightly.</p><p></p><p>"Does the cat have an aversion to vanilla?"</p><p></p><p>After breakfast, Ye Xiao went to work alone, not taking Huan Liuli with him.</p><p></p><p>She had already collapsed next to the toilet, vomiting. Ye Xiao decided to give her the day off to rest properly.</p><p></p><p>Arriving at the library, he clocked in, started work, and began to study the healing techniques.</p><p></p><p>He had now been promoted to a manager, and could roam freely on the third floor, no longer bound like before.</p><p></p><p>Soon, one of the four managers, Old Wang, came over with a bag of celebratory candies and red eggs, handing them out to his colleagues with a beaming smile.</p><p></p><p>"Old Wang, is there good news in your family?"</p><p></p><p>"My great-grandson was born."</p><p></p><p>"Wow, you've got a great-grandson now, I'll have to have two of your eggs today to share in the joy."</p><p></p><p>Here is the full English translation of the Chinese excerpt:</p><p></p><p>"Yes, yes, here you go Ye Xiao, this is for you."</p><p></p><p>Ye Xiao put down his book and took the egg and candies.</p><p></p><p>"Thank you."</p><p></p><p>"You're welcome. On Saturday noon, go to the Red Moon Restaurant to attend my grandson's full moon celebration."</p><p></p><p>Ye Xiao nodded, looking at the egg in his hand, suddenly feeling its weight was quite heavy.</p><p></p><p>A red chicken egg, worth no less than two hundred, he might not even be able to finish it.</p><p></p><p>Enough to buy how many tea leaf eggs? The other manager, Old Liu, had grabbed a handful of candies and eggs.</p><p></p><p>His stinginess was well-known, but the straightforward and quick-tongued Sister Wang couldn't help but mock him a little.</p><p></p><p>"Old Liu, look at how stingy you are, even a few eggs you're so greedy about. Just take two as a gesture."</p><p></p><p>Old Liu had a thick skin and didn't mind at all, smiling as he said:</p><p></p><p>"What do you know? This one egg can hatch into a little chick, if I eat one egg, it's equivalent to eating a whole chicken, it's not cheap at all!"</p><p></p><p>"Huh?"</p><p></p><p>Sister Wang immediately sneered, "Then by that logic, am I not eating billions of people every day?"</p><p></p><p>The two's banter drew a lot of laughter from their colleagues, the entire third floor was filled with a joyous atmosphere.</p><p></p><p>Ye Xiao ate the egg and candies and continued reading his book.</p><p></p><p>The harvest this morning was not bad, it might be because he hadn't specifically focused on healing techniques before, so after concentrating on them this morning, he managed to collect three basic healing techniques.</p><p></p><p>With this, added to the two healing techniques he already knew, he now had a total of five basic healing techniques.</p><p></p><p>After refining these basic techniques through the Golden Book Shen Huan for a day and a night, they had all reached the Great Perfection realm.</p><p></p><p>With these Great Perfection healing techniques, when used together, Ye Xiao already had a pretty good healing speed.</p><p></p><p>For example, he tried cutting his hair, and after using the healing techniques, he could instantly restore the length of his hair.</p><p></p><p>He had even thought about trying something more extreme, like severing his own fingers, to see if he could recover them quickly.</p><p></p><p>But it was too painful, so he eventually abandoned that idea.</p><p></p><p>Just then, he saw Huan Liuli coming back from outside with a fish she had caught.</p><p></p><p>"Stop!"</p><p></p><p>Huan Liuli froze in place, looking confused:</p><p></p><p>"Master, what's wrong?"</p><p></p><p>"The fish is so cute, why do you want to eat it?"</p><p></p><p>Huan Liuli: "????"</p><p></p><p>"That's too cruel, you must be punished."</p><p></p><p>Boom! The next moment, accompanied by an explosive sound, Ye Xiao punched Huan Liuli, sending her flying.</p><p></p><p>"Meow~!"</p><p></p><p>Huan Liuli crashed heavily to the ground, her small head directly embedded in the soil, her little dress slipping down due to the force, like a lotus leaf sprawled on the ground, only her white stockinged legs flailing about, looking just like a rabbit's twitching ears.</p><p></p><p>Ye Xiao walked over, grabbed her by the legs with one hand, and pulled her out of the ground like pulling a radish.</p><p></p><p>"Sorry, I forgot, cats are supposed to eat fish. Let me heal you now."</p><p></p><p>With that, Ye Xiao immediately activated five basic healing techniques.</p><p></p><p>Five white light beams formed in his palm, quickly healing Huan Liuli's injuries, the entire process taking about five seconds.</p><p></p><p>Ye Xiao silently noted down this data in his mind, then patted her small head.</p><p></p><p>"In the future, if I forget something, you have to explain it to me, otherwise I'll misunderstand, won't I?"</p><p></p><p>Then he turned and walked back into the house.</p><p></p><p>Huan Liuri sat on the ground, tilting her head like a little duckling, a perplexed expression on her face.</p><p></p><p>"Why do I feel like he did that on purpose?"</p><p></p><p>Second update, support the new book.</p><p></p><p>(Chapter end)</p>

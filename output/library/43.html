        <h1>Chapter 43</h1>
        <div class="content">
            <p>Here is the full English translation of the Chinese excerpt:</p><p></p><p>"Ah—! Ah—!"</p><p></p><p>The distant cries of a few hoarse crows caused Ye Xiao's eyelids to twitch slightly.</p><p></p><p>Looking at the last message, with its frantic symbols due to anxiety, Ye Xiao's face became as grim as the night.</p><p></p><p>He put the phone back in his pocket, closed his eyes, and activated the Taixuan Tiangong, rapidly spreading his spiritual power in a lightning-like speed, extending it in all directions.</p><p></p><p>As the Taixuan Tiangong spread, Ye Xiao's spiritual power covered the entire Jianghai City! After cultivating the Taixuan Tiangong, Ye Xiao's spiritual power had been greatly enhanced with each passing moment.</p><p></p><p>It could be said that even a powerful sect master would be completely insignificant before Ye Xiao.</p><p></p><p>The spiritual power feedback came back in fifteen seconds, and Ye Xiao opened his eyes, two cold, sharp beams shooting out like sword lights.</p><p></p><p>He lightly stepped, his body turning into a beam of light, rushing towards the direction his spiritual power had locked onto.</p><p></p><p>Huanliuli climbed up from the sofa, scratching her soft, crystal-like soles, and murmured drowsily, "Was that a big white mouse that just ran by?"</p><p></p><p>More than 200 kilometers outside of Jianghai City, in the deep mountains and old forests, the battlefield was raging.</p><p></p><p>Various roars, battle cries, and screams never ceased.</p><p></p><p>A dozen defense team members, back-to-back in a circle, holding steel knives, were frantically hacking and slashing at the mutant tiger-wolves charging at them with the knife techniques they had cultivated.</p><p></p><p>Among these tiger-wolves, there were not only humans, but also star beasts, and even a few wearing the defense team's uniforms.</p><p></p><p>Once bitten or scratched by them, the soul would be infected, and within a few hours, they would become mutant tiger-wolves, then go on to frantically attack other uninfected beings!</p><p></p><p>Gu Hai and the other defense team members were already dyed in fresh blood.</p><p></p><p>The defense team squad leader cleaved two mutant star beasts in half, retreating back into the group, gritting his teeth as he said:</p><p></p><p>"Have you contacted headquarters?"</p><p></p><p>"No, the signal is still cut off. The signal is poor in the mountains anyway, and after they discovered us, they used a signal jammer."</p><p></p><p>"What about your personal phones, can you contact the outside?"</p><p></p><p>"No, the mobile signal is also jammed."</p><p></p><p>"Damn it!"</p><p></p><p>He spat out a mouthful of blood, then killed two more tiger-wolves with a slash, his face icy cold as he said:</p><p></p><p>"There are so many mutant tiger-wolves hiding here, they must be planning to do something to Jianghai City. We have to report the situation out. Everyone, fight your way back, kill a path out of here. As long as one person can escape and convey the situation, that will be our victory! Kill—!"</p><p></p><p>With a commanding shout, he took the lead, charging out. As a post-heavenly seventh-grade cultivator, his combat power was extraordinary.</p><p></p><p>The tiger-wolves were not that strong, and in an instant, he had hacked out a bloody path, the others quickly following.</p><p></p><p>But at this moment, Gu Hai's calf suddenly exploded in pain, making the hair on his body stand on end.</p><p></p><p>Looking down, it was a mutant swift wolf whose head had been chopped off, but it had still bitten him.</p><p></p><p>"Damn it!"</p><p></p><p>Gu Hai cleaved the swift wolf's head, but was thus slowed down, and the next moment, mutant tiger-wolves and mutant star beasts came rushing in crazily.</p><p></p><p>"It's over!"</p><p></p><p>Gu Hai's legs went soft with fear, his mind going blank.</p><p></p><p>At the critical moment, a figure suddenly appeared in front of him, frantically slashing the charging tiger-wolves and star beasts.</p><p></p><p>Another figure quickly grabbed his shoulder, pulling him away, and the next moment, the one who had stood in front of him was engulfed by the mutant tiger-wolves and star beasts.</p><p></p><p>Here is the full English translation of the Chinese excerpt:</p><p></p><p>"Old Li!" </p><p></p><p>Gu Hai let out a heart-wrenching scream, but the other party could no longer hear him.</p><p></p><p>"Gu Hai, hurry and leave! Don't space out, or people will die!"</p><p></p><p>On a mountain peak, several human figures were watching from above, as if watching a performance. Not only did they not have the slightest bit of compassion, but they were also constantly mocking.</p><p></p><p>"You guys guess, how long do you think they can hold out?"</p><p></p><p>"I guess three minutes!"</p><p></p><p>"Too long, I think a maximum of one minute!"</p><p></p><p>"They've basically all been bitten, the more wounds, the faster the infection will spread. I estimate their spirits have already been affected, and they can only hold out for thirty seconds at most!"</p><p></p><p>The members of the defense team at the foot of the mountain were falling one by one, being devoured and torn apart by the mutant beasts, dying in agonizing screams! Gu Hai felt his consciousness gradually becoming blurred, an unnamed force was invading his mind! His eyes could no longer see clearly, his retinas had turned blood-red, only the high-tech combat goggles could still show the thermal imaging.</p><p></p><p>In the thermal imaging, the mutant life forms were all green, while the vibrant life forms were red!</p><p></p><p>Every time a red light went out, it meant the fall of another teammate.</p><p></p><p>"Am I going to die too? Is this what death feels like? Like a withering flower, gradually, without breath, without spiritual power."</p><p></p><p>"Dad, Mom, Xiao Xiao, Old Ye, and little baby... Goodbye."</p><p></p><p>Gu Hai no longer had the strength to swing the alloy steel knife in his hand, in his last moments of consciousness, the thermal imaging goggles showed countless green figures rushing towards him.</p><p></p><p>His spiritual power was invaded and numbed, he felt his soul floating, no longer able to feel the pain of his physical body! But! Just as Gu Hai was about to completely give up, a golden light, like a descending deity, suddenly fell beside him.</p><p></p><p>Boom! Accompanied by this earth-shattering explosion, the shockwave swept away all the mutant tigers and star beasts within a hundred meters.</p><p></p><p>"Good, I'm not too late."</p><p></p><p>Ye Xiao heaved a sigh of relief, his eyes revealing a trace of satisfaction.</p><p></p><p>"Waaah!"</p><p></p><p>The words had just fallen when Gu Hai's frenzied scream came from behind.</p><p></p><p>Ye Xiao turned around, just in time to see Gu Hai with bloodshot eyes, opening his mouth wide like a hungry wolf, pouncing towards him.</p><p></p><p>Ye Xiao's expression darkened, he raised a finger and pointed it at Gu Hai's brow, using spiritual energy to fix him in place, unable to move.</p><p></p><p>The healing art repaired his physical body, and the Taixuan Heavenly Might was also activated, invading Gu Hai's consciousness, completely crushing the evil spiritual energy that had infected his soul. Plop.</p><p></p><p>After Ye Xiao had completely healed his injuries, Gu Hai fell to the ground like a dead pig.</p><p></p><p>"Sleep for a while, you'll be fine when you wake up."</p><p></p><p>Ye Xiao patted his back, releasing the healing art and Taixuan Heavenly Might again, treating the few defense team members who were about to mutate, removing the evil spiritual energy from their souls and putting them into a deep sleep.</p><p></p><p>Seeing this scene, the figures on the mountain frowned, their killing intent surging.</p><p></p><p>"Who is the one coming down the mountain? Why are they ruining our good plans?"</p><p></p><p>Ye Xiao raised his head, his starry eyes emitting cold glints.</p><p></p><p>Without further ado, the Slashing Heaven Sword Technique was frantically operating within his body, and a golden light suddenly spread from the top of his head, instantly slicing through the night sky, directly towards the mountain.</p><p></p><p>This is the first update, please support the new book.</p><p></p><p>(Chapter end)</p>

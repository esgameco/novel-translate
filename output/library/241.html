        <h1>Chapter 241</h1>
        <div class="content">
            <p>Here is the full English translation of the Chinese excerpt:</p><p></p><p>As my martial cultivation continues to breakthrough to higher levels, the energy I require becomes increasingly more. Moreover, the beast calamity is imminent, and time is running out. I can no longer leisurely read books in the library and slowly cultivate my strength through those cultivation techniques.</p><p></p><p>I must break through in the shortest time possible.</p><p></p><p>With a determined gaze, Ye Xiao took a deep breath and leaped off the Demon Cliff.</p><p></p><p>The moment he jumped off the Demon Cliff, Ye Xiao could clearly feel a powerful force constantly surging upwards.</p><p></p><p>This force was not trying to lift him back up, but rather because there was too much, too dense of it down below, exceeding the capacity that could be contained.</p><p></p><p>So it kept gushing upwards, releasing its evil qi, killing qi, and foul air.</p><p></p><p>Ye Xiao did not activate his divine will technique, but instead allowed himself to descend slowly.</p><p></p><p>Although his strength was already formidable, he should still exercise some caution.</p><p></p><p>After all, he was not yet an invincible existence.</p><p></p><p>He had never been to the Demon Cliff before and did not know the conditions beneath it.</p><p></p><p>By descending slowly, if any abnormalities occurred, he could promptly extricate himself.</p><p></p><p>As he began to descend into the black mist, his vision became obstructed.</p><p></p><p>Even though he was now a half-step Monarch realm expert who had cultivated ocular techniques, his vision was still not as effective here. And as his body continued to descend, with the killing qi growing increasingly stronger below, his vision would be further impaired.</p><p></p><p>No wonder few dared to come to this place.</p><p></p><p>Even he, a mighty half-step Monarch, had his senses suppressed to a certain degree upon entering, let alone those ordinary Deity Sect disciples.</p><p></p><p>They would likely be rendered completely blind upon arriving here, unable to see anything at all.</p><p></p><p>In the darkness, Ye Xiao felt as if countless eyes were staring at him.</p><p></p><p>However, Ye Xiao remained calm, for he had a technique - the Spiritual Dao of the Profound Heavenly Vortex.</p><p></p><p>Although there was dense killing qi here, it could only shield the physical senses, but not suppress spiritual power.</p><p></p><p>As he activated the Profound Heavenly Vortex, it rapidly expanded outwards at hundreds of times per second.</p><p></p><p>This way, in Ye Xiao's mind, the entire dark Demon Cliff instantly transformed into broad daylight.</p><p></p><p>Everything became crystal clear to him.</p><p></p><p>It was then that he could see what exactly was staring at him.</p><p></p><p>Densely packed were all manner of star beasts, and among them, some half-beast humans as well.</p><p></p><p>The vast majority were hiding here, seeking to evade human pursuit, waiting for the beast calamity to arrive so they could then rush up the Demon Cliff and ferociously attack the human race.</p><p></p><p>Ye Xiao even spotted a few human cultivators among them.</p><p></p><p>But those human cultivators were clearly no longer ordinary humans.</p><p></p><p>They had most likely consumed star beast cores and cultivated some demonic techniques, appearing neither fully human nor fully ghost-like.</p><p></p><p>The majority of them possessed strength at the late Transcendent Fifth Rank or Transcendent Seventh/Eighth Rank. Only a few exceptional ones reached the Transcendent Ninth Rank.</p><p></p><p>He did not see any Patriarchs.</p><p></p><p>The two sides of the cliff were not smooth, bearing many traces of attacks.</p><p></p><p>Perhaps they were the remnants of infighting among the star beasts, or possibly the battles between ancient human and star beast experts.</p><p></p><p>Many of the marks looked truly terrifying.</p><p></p><p>Speaking of the Demon Cliff, although it had weathered countless years, Ye Xiao had a feeling that it was not naturally formed, but rather cleaved by a powerful strike.</p><p></p><p>This Demon Cliff was unfathomably deep, at least tens of thousands of zhang, if it were on Earth, it might even reach the magma layer.</p><p></p><p>So deep!</p><p></p><p>The one capable of creating such a structure must have been far beyond Ye Xiao's current strength.</p><p></p><p>But thinking about it, that makes sense.</p><p></p><p>After all, those ancient experts were inherently stronger than the cultivators of this era.</p><p></p><p>There had been many awe-inspiring figures throughout history.</p><p></p><p>The appearance of a few existences stronger than him was not surprising.</p><p></p><p>Especially since even now, there were still many beings more powerful than him - the Monarch realm experts in the Starry Sky Battlefield, and the rumored Emperor realm masters, the divine beasts and super divine beasts among the star beasts, all surpassing his own strength.</p><p></p><p>Although Ye Xiao was descending slowly, he would still not be as slow as a person falling from a high place.</p><p></p><p>Soon, he had descended below 10,000 meters.</p><p></p><p>At this distance, he could already see some Innate First Rank Patriarch-level star beasts.</p><p></p><p>Ye Xiao calculated that the deeper one went, the better it would be for the star beasts to cultivate.</p><p></p><p>For the strongest star beasts died down below, and their vigorous life force would be most concentrated there, gradually diffusing outwards until bursting out of the Demon Cliff.</p><p></p><p>Come to think of it, this Demon Cliff was actually an excellent cultivation ground.</p><p></p><p>There was an abundance of life force here.</p><p></p><p>The only issue was that it was not very suitable for the human race, as there was a large amount of resentful qi, killing qi, and foul air. This was a paradise for demonic cultivators, star beasts, and half-beast humans.</p><p></p><p>Here is the full English translation of the Chinese excerpt:</p><p></p><p>It's no wonder that the Dragon Slaughter Society would rise up here.</p><p></p><p>However, although this kind of place is not suitable for the human race to cultivate, it does not mean that there are no heavenly materials and earthly treasures here.</p><p></p><p>On the contrary, there are actually many good things here.</p><p></p><p>Ye Xiao has already seen some blood spirit mushrooms growing on the cliffs.</p><p></p><p>Their bodies contain a large amount of blood qi, and if the essence within them is refined, it can be used to make very good elixirs.</p><p></p><p>Moreover, these pure energy beings are not affected by the evil qi in the Demon Gorge.</p><p></p><p>They are all completely natural.</p><p></p><p>But Ye Xiao did not go to pick them, as these things, although very good, do not have much use for someone at his level.</p><p></p><p>They would be excellent materials for Xiantian-grade cultivators.</p><p></p><p>Ye Xiao also won't use his spatial storage ring to collect these things.</p><p></p><p>There must be much better things below, and he doesn't know if he can even fit them all. He can't just pick up the sesame and lose the watermelon.</p><p></p><p>However, just because he is not interested in these things, it does not mean that the Xiantian Patriarchs on both sides will not be wary of him.</p><p></p><p>In their eyes, Ye Xiao is more like an intruder who has come to this place with unsettling intentions.</p><p></p><p>They don't know what his purpose is, but they can't help but suspect that Ye Xiao might have some ideas, such as robbing their things.</p><p></p><p>For this reason, some star beasts in the darkness have already started to stir.</p><p></p><p>The vast majority of star beasts have not done so, as most of them are quite intelligent.</p><p></p><p>They know that if a human dares to come to this kind of place, if it's not because their brain is broken, then it must be because their strength is monstrous.</p><p></p><p>And the vast majority of humans, even if their brain is broken, shouldn't come to this kind of place so casually.</p><p></p><p>So they are more inclined to the latter explanation.</p><p></p><p>Ye Xiao is a monster! A monster so strong that it terrifies the star beasts! At this time, those star beasts whose brains are not working very well have already started to attack Ye Xiao.</p><p></p><p>In the darkness, some energy blades are bursting towards Ye Xiao.</p><p></p><p>Ye Xiao raised his eyebrows slightly.</p><p></p><p>His real target is the big fish below, so he can't be bothered with these small fry.</p><p></p><p>But that doesn't mean these small fry can piss and shit on his head.</p><p></p><p>With a snort, the Taixuan Tiangong erupted, and all the Xiantian star beasts who had attacked were instantly blown into a bloody mist.</p><p></p><p>Boom, boom, boom...</p><p></p><p>This series of violent explosions caused quite a stir among the star beast group.</p><p></p><p>Many star beasts started to scream and flee upwards.</p><p></p><p>But there were also many smart star beasts who realized that Ye Xiao had only killed the star beasts that had attacked him, so they remained motionless, obediently lying where they should be.</p><p></p><p>Ye Xiao paid them no mind and continued to descend. When he descended to about 20,000 feet, Xiantian Fourth and Fifth Grade Patriarch-level powerhouses began to appear!</p><p></p><p>These star beasts, even though they had guessed that Ye Xiao might have extraordinary strength, were still extremely confident in their own powerful abilities.</p><p></p><p>So they wanted to go and challenge this human's strength, to see just how strong he was, that he dared to come to the Demon Gorge and descend to such a deep area.</p><p></p><p>"Roar!"</p><p></p><p>Accompanied by a beast roar that echoed through the cliffs, a Xiantian Fourth Grade star beast with wings and a skeleton-like body rushed towards Ye Xiao.</p><p></p><p>The best reward for its courage would be to send it down.</p><p></p><p>Then the second star beast, the third star beast, the fourth, until hundreds and thousands of star beasts, as if possessed, frantically pounced towards Ye Xiao, wanting to tear him to shreds.</p><p></p><p>Various battle methods were constantly erupting in the darkness.</p><p></p><p>From time to time, there would be bursts of flame light, illuminating the black mist, and then disappearing again, only to erupt once more.</p><p></p><p>This terrifying scene made the star beasts above even more panicked and restless.</p><p></p><p>Screams arose, and many star beasts had already begun to flee the Demon Gorge in advance.</p><p></p><p>But the fierce battle did not last long, only about ten seconds or so, and then everything became silent again.</p><p></p><p>The star beasts did not know what had happened, but it made them feel even more frightened.</p><p></p><p>Because normally, there would be some star beasts that would clash and fight with each other.</p><p></p><p>But the duration of those battles could never be this short.</p><p></p><p>Moreover, this time, a human was involved. There could only be two possibilities - either this human died, or he had killed all the star beasts.</p><p></p><p>But if the human had died, the other star beasts should have fiercely fought over his corpse to devour it, right? And it wouldn't be so quiet down below! Could it be that the human had slaughtered the star beasts? Thinking about this, countless star beasts suddenly felt like they had gone mad.</p>

        <h1>Chapter 85</h1>
        <div class="content">
            <p>Here is the full English translation of the Chinese excerpt:</p><p></p><p>"This is..." </p><p></p><p>Ye Xiao could see at a glance that the current Fa Zheng was not human! Or rather, he was not a human.</p><p></p><p>Within his body, there were two spiritual forces battling for control of his body, one of which was his own, and the other was an evil soul.</p><p></p><p>"No wonder Fa Zheng's state of mind was affected before, it turns out there was an evil spirit that had invaded his body."</p><p></p><p>This evil spirit was absolutely not simple.</p><p></p><p>At least, it had to be close to Fa Zheng's own soul in order to influence Fa Zheng.</p><p></p><p>It should not have just invaded Fa Zheng's body in the past few days, but had been residing in Fa Zheng's body for a long time. Previously, its strength must have been very weak, unable to affect Fa Zheng, but now it had grown stronger.</p><p></p><p>Night belongs to the yin, and Fa Zheng, who cultivates the spiritual techniques of the Buddhist school, belongs to the extremely yang type. At night, he would be suppressed.</p><p></p><p>While the other party was extremely yin and evil, its effects at night would be stronger than usual.</p><p></p><p>The combination of yin and yang naturally brought it closer to Fa Zheng.</p><p></p><p>At this moment, Fa Zheng was struggling to resist the other party.</p><p></p><p>If the other party were to defeat Fa Zheng, it would seize control of Fa Zheng's body.</p><p></p><p>At that time, Fa Zheng would no longer be Fa Zheng, but an evil demon! An evil demon with the power of a grand master! If Ye Xiao were not here, before the experts from other cities could arrive, this evil demon could destroy tens of thousands, or even hundreds of thousands of lives in Jianghai City.</p><p></p><p>At this moment, Ye Xiao suddenly began to believe in fate a little.</p><p></p><p>Perhaps, Heaven arranged for him to cooperate with Fa Zheng on this mission, just to save him, to save the entire Jianghai City, from this calamity.</p><p></p><p>Closing the book slowly, Ye Xiao began to use the Taixuan Tiangong technique to scan Fa Zheng's memories.</p><p></p><p>Normally, Fa Zheng would definitely have noticed Ye Xiao's actions, after all, he was also a grand master of the fifth rank of the Xiantian realm.</p><p></p><p>Being unable to resist Ye Xiao did not mean he could not detect him.</p><p></p><p>But now, he was preoccupied with fighting the evil spirit within, and could not pay attention to Ye Xiao.</p><p></p><p>Soon, Ye Xiao quickly browsed through Fa Zheng's memories, as if watching a movie, and found the reason.</p><p></p><p>It was when Fa Zheng had just entered the Shaolin Martial Arts Academy, and had not yet become a grand master.</p><p></p><p>The young him, and the old him, were equally kind.</p><p></p><p>One year in the cold winter of the twelfth lunar month, he and his senior brothers were returning to the dormitory after cultivating their martial arts.</p><p></p><p>Passing through a snowy field, he rescued a Yin Shadow Snake in the snow.</p><p></p><p>The Yin Shadow Snake is of the Tiger-level bloodline in the Dragon, Tiger, and Wolf three-level bloodlines, and it was even of the upper class of the Tiger-level!</p><p></p><p>The Yin Shadow Snake that Fa Zheng rescued was one that had already cultivated to the Superhuman Realm, and was only one step away from reaching the Grand Master realm.</p><p></p><p>It had been injured by someone and fled to the training ground, where it was then frozen by the ice and snow.</p><p></p><p>The kind-hearted Fa Zheng rescued it and placed it in his bosom to warm it.</p><p></p><p>However, the Yin Shadow Snake repaid his kindness with malice and bit Fa Zheng.</p><p></p><p>A real-life version of the Farmer and the Snake.</p><p></p><p>The Yin Shadow Snake's bloodline had a special ability, which could transfer its soul to another person's body through the medium of fresh blood, and could also conceal itself perfectly.</p><p></p><p>So, for all these years, it had been lurking in Fa Zheng's body, accompanying Fa Zheng in subduing demons, slaying spirit beasts, half-beasts, and evil ghosts, silently absorbing their resentment and continuously enhancing its own spiritual power.</p><p></p><p>Until now, its spiritual power had become as strong as that of a grand master of the fifth rank of the Xiantian realm, and it could influence Fa Zheng.</p><p></p><p>And Fa Zheng could no longer expel it!</p><p></p><p>When Ye Xiao finished watching all this, Fa Zheng, or rather the Yin Shadow Snake, became aware.</p><p></p><p>Here is the full English translation of the Chinese excerpt:</p><p></p><p>A burst of self-satisfied eerie laughter.</p><p></p><p>"Hahaha, hahaha! Sixty years! Sixty whole years! I've finally succeeded!"</p><p></p><p>This sinister voice sent chills down one's spine. It was clear that in the high yin energy of the night, Fa Zheng was ultimately no match for the Shadow Snake.</p><p></p><p>Now, his soul had been suppressed by the Shadow Snake, and the Shadow Snake had seized control of his body.</p><p></p><p>Crack, crack.</p><p></p><p>The Shadow Snake twisted its stiff neck at an extremely creepy angle, staring fixedly at Ye Xiao.</p><p></p><p>"Human? You're really quite lucky to witness my resurrection. As a reward, I'm going to eat you bit by bit."</p><p></p><p>With that, it stuck out its tongue, licking its lips, and drool was dripping down uncontrollably.</p><p></p><p>"It's been a whole sixty years since I've tasted human flesh."</p><p></p><p>Ye Xiao's expression remained calm and indifferent as he looked at it.</p><p></p><p>This composed expression made the Shadow Snake raise its eyebrows slightly.</p><p></p><p>"Human, aren't you afraid of me?"</p><p></p><p>Ye Xiao still didn't speak, but the impatient voice of Illusion Glaze suddenly came from beside him.</p><p></p><p>"Are you done blabbering? I still need to sleep, and I have to go to work tomorrow. Don't you have any civic-mindedness?"</p><p></p><p>The Shadow Snake was taken aback, then shifted its gaze to the Illusion Cat.</p><p></p><p>The moment it saw the Illusion Cat, its expression suddenly paused, as if it hadn't fully reacted yet. The next moment, it let out an agonized scream.</p><p></p><p>"Dragon-level bloodline beast, the Illusion Cat? How can there be an Illusion Cat here? Impossible!"</p><p></p><p>After two heart-wrenching screams, it seemed to have thought of something else and screamed again.</p><p></p><p>"Wait a minute, I can't sense your aura at all? You've concealed your aura? Are you an Illusion Cat that has already cultivated to the Patriarch Realm?! Fuck!"</p><p></p><p>It was normal for Fa Zheng's main body not to recognize the Illusion Cat, as he was not a specialized beast tamer, and his spiritual power could not suppress Ye Xiao.</p><p></p><p>But the Shadow Snake absolutely could not be mistaken, not only because of the special connection between beasts, which far surpassed that of humans, but also for an extremely important reason.</p><p></p><p>The Illusion Cat's favorite food is the Shadow Snake! The Illusion Cat can be said to be the natural enemy of the Shadow Snake, and it is an absolute crushing superiority in both bloodline and cultivation. Years of oppression have deeply imprinted the fear of the Illusion Cat into its genes.</p><p></p><p>And here was an Illusion Cat!</p><p></p><p>No, no, no!</p><p></p><p>The key problem doesn't seem to be with the Illusion Cat.</p><p></p><p>It turned its head again, looking at Ye Xiao, then at the Illusion Cat, and then back at Ye Xiao.</p><p></p><p>A human and an Illusion Cat peacefully coexisting, and the Illusion Cat sleeping at the foot of Ye Xiao's bed, this was clearly a picture of a loyal servant!</p><p></p><p>This seemingly naive young human, in its eyes, was just like a baby in swaddling clothes, yet he was the master of a Patriarch Realm Illusion Cat?</p><p></p><p>Then how strong must this guy be? Fuck!</p><p></p><p>Did it not check the auspicious calendar before going out today?</p><p></p><p>In that instant, the entire Shadow Snake was in trouble.</p><p></p><p>It was completely flustered. "Flee!"</p>

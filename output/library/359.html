        <h1>Chapter 359</h1>
        <div class="content">
            <p>Here is the full English translation of the Chinese excerpt:</p><p></p><p>This discovery was a huge windfall for Ye Xiao. </p><p></p><p>Unexpectedly, he had unknowingly obtained a pure natural divine crystal vein, which would be equivalent to a penniless youth suddenly acquiring wealth beyond the entire world's.</p><p></p><p>It's not even possible to calculate the benefits using units like "trillions" - even "quadrillions" might not be enough.</p><p></p><p>"No, this is not the time to think about that. Compared to the Kunlun Dragon Vein in front of me, the more pressing issue is the Divine Realm Treasure Trove."</p><p></p><p>Ye Xiao began to activate his Elemental Eyes again, further scanning the entire dragon vein.</p><p></p><p>The powerful force of the Elemental Eyes kept penetrating into the dragon vein, and finally, Ye Xiao saw a massive imperial city.</p><p></p><p>It was a city roughly the size of a state in the Nine Realms.</p><p></p><p>It was completely sealed within divine crystals.</p><p></p><p>Ye Xiao's heart started racing uncontrollably again.</p><p></p><p>The Divine Realm Treasure Trove!</p><p></p><p>Was that the Divine Realm Treasure Trove?</p><p></p><p>A complete treasure trove of an entire divine realm.</p><p></p><p>The treasures and resources within, who knows how abundant they are.</p><p></p><p>If one could obtain all those resources, even a Divine Emperor might find it hard to resist the temptation. Ye Xiao didn't know exactly what was inside, but the fact that it gave birth to the mighty Kunlun Dragon Vein was proof enough.</p><p></p><p>He must obtain this Divine Realm Treasure Trove.</p><p></p><p>However, there was one troublesome issue - the divine crystals surrounding it.</p><p></p><p>Divine crystals were not something that could be casually cut into. For such a massive scale, the cutting would require extreme caution, as he definitely could not just recklessly release divine arts to cut through them.</p><p></p><p>Although divine crystals had relatively stable energy, they were not 100% constant.</p><p></p><p>Divine arts could cut through quickly, but their immense power also posed great risks.</p><p></p><p>If he did it wrong and ended up blowing up the entire dragon vein, he had no idea if the Divine Realm Treasure Trove would be destroyed as well. But one thing he knew for certain:</p><p></p><p>He and the entire human world would be reduced to ashes!</p><p></p><p>Furthermore, with such a massive dragon vein and so many divine crystals, no sane person would want to destroy it. Its value was simply unparalleled.</p><p></p><p>He must find a way to obtain it.</p><p></p><p>However, there was one problem - as more and more divine tombs were being excavated in the starry sky, there was a high chance that someone might discover information about the Divine Realm Treasure Trove.</p><p></p><p>That would spell trouble.</p><p></p><p>So he couldn't delay too long, he had to unearth the Divine Realm Treasure Trove before someone else did.</p><p></p><p>Should he use his spiritual clone to dig it out? But that wouldn't be enough, the spiritual clone's strength was relatively weak. He had just broken through to the Divine Realm, and even a spiritual clone would only reach Emperor Realm level, just slightly stronger than ordinary Emperor Realm cultivators.</p><p></p><p>And the number of spiritual clones he could create was limited.</p><p></p><p>But where could he find so many people on short notice? After a moment of contemplation, Ye Xiao reached into his pocket, the corner of his mouth curling up slightly.</p><p></p><p>Miners?</p><p></p><p>Didn't he have plenty of ready-made ones? Before reaching the Divine Realm, he had made these star beasts offer a large amount of flesh and blood for his needs. But now that he had entered the Divine Realm, their blood qi could no longer provide him much benefit.</p><p></p><p>In this case, continuing to demand their blood qi wouldn't be very meaningful.</p><p></p><p>Rather than that, he could develop some completely new uses for them.</p><p></p><p>Having them mine the divine crystals would be far more valuable than them offering blood and flesh.</p><p></p><p>He instantly teleported to the Ancestral Imperial Seal, where the star beasts were diligently cultivating, still trying to offer their meat, eggs, and honey. At this moment, the star beasts suddenly felt an overwhelmingly powerful aura descend, and they all prostrated on the ground, trembling.</p><p></p><p>"So powerful! Has he already successfully advanced to the Divine Realm?"</p><p></p><p>The super-grade star beasts were shocked, but soon their expressions turned to despair.</p><p></p><p>They were shocked by Ye Xiao's lightning-fast advancement. Even the most talented geniuses would likely need decades to reach this realm, yet he had done it in just two years.</p><p></p><p>And they were despairing because now that he had reached this level, they, the star beasts, must have become useless to him.</p><p></p><p>It was time to "grind the millstone and kill the donkey."</p><p></p><p>What was even more tragic was that they had no way to resist.</p><p></p><p>Facing the Divine Realm, they were less than ants, mere specks of insignificant dust.</p><p></p><p>Others could casually blow them away to the ends of the earth with a single breath.</p><p></p><p>Ye Xiao glanced at the star beasts, knowing full well their thoughts.</p><p></p><p>He then spoke calmly:</p><p></p><p>"I have now advanced to the Divine Realm, and your blood qi is no longer of great use to me.</p><p></p><p>I'm sure you all understand that if you have no value to me, I have no obligation to continue keeping you.</p><p></p><p>But now, I'm giving you an opportunity, a chance to survive."</p><p></p><p>The star beasts immediately nodded their heads, not even waiting for Ye Xiao to explain what the task was, they eagerly said:</p><p></p><p>"We are willing to do it."</p><p></p><p>"For our master, we are willing to go through fire and water without hesitation."</p><p></p><p>"Master, just give us your orders, and we will obey without question!"</p><p></p><p>"Master, we don't need spiritual..."</p><p></p><p>Here is the full English translation of the Chinese excerpt:</p><p></p><p>"Grass, free labor."</p><p></p><p>"Master, not only do we not want the spiritual grass, we will provide free labor and flesh as well."</p><p></p><p>Ye Xiao: "(_..)! Damn it, I had prepared a whole bunch of arguments, coercion and inducement, carrot and stick, all ready to use.</p><p></p><p>But unexpectedly, it was all in vain. As soon as I said it, they had already agreed on their own.</p><p></p><p>Has the level of self-exploitation among these star beasts reached such a degree?</p><p></p><p>"Ahem, I'm not that heartless either. I will still give you the spiritual grass, and you don't need the flesh for now. But you have to do one thing for me, day and night without rest."</p><p></p><p>I still need to use some incentive methods, because Ye Xiao is in a hurry and must get them to speed up.</p><p></p><p>Only when they want to do it in their hearts will they truly speed up.</p><p></p><p>"Okay! Master, tell us what to do?"</p><p></p><p>The next moment, when they saw the huge dragon vein that had completely formed a divine crystal mine, all the star beasts were dumbfounded.</p><p></p><p>"Fuck!"</p><p></p><p>Such a large dragon vein, so many divine crystals, are they joking with us? That's divine crystals, not spirit stones!</p><p></p><p>Although for the star beasts, the effect is not very great, because they can absorb the spiritual energy of heaven and earth on their own.</p><p></p><p>But they still have a certain concept of the value of this thing in their minds.</p><p></p><p>If this divine crystal mine is fully excavated, how rich would Ye Xiao become?</p><p></p><p>Ye Xiao's wealth would instantly surpass more than 95% of the people in the entire starry sky! Ye Xiao cleared his throat and said, "From today on, all of you star beasts are responsible for mining here, digging day and night without rest, since you don't need to rest anyway.</p><p></p><p>The more you dig, the more spiritual grass I will give you as a reward.</p><p></p><p>The reward will be more generous than the blood energy you provided before.</p><p></p><p>Of course, the level of the reward depends on your mining progress and effort.</p><p></p><p>When you finish the excavation, I may even consider releasing you and returning your freedom!"</p><p></p><p>First draw a big pie, and by the time they finish digging, his own cultivation will probably have reached an unknown realm.</p><p></p><p>By then, even if he really wants to release them, they probably won't dare to leave.</p><p></p><p>Hearing these words, all the star beasts immediately went crazy.</p><p></p><p>"Really? Did I hear that right?"</p><p></p><p>"Not only do we have spiritual grass, but we can also be released?"</p><p></p><p>The star beasts were instantly excited with tears in their eyes.</p><p></p><p>What they wanted most was what? One was to live, the other was freedom.</p><p></p><p>Previously, they were still worried that Ye Xiao would break through the divine realm and cross the river to demolish them all.</p><p></p><p>But unexpectedly, he actually arranged such a good job for them! What more is there to say? Roll up your sleeves and get to work!</p><p></p><p>Dig to the death!</p><p></p><p>The star beasts immediately began to shout loudly, "Master, don't worry, we guarantee to complete the task."</p><p></p><p>"Not only to guarantee the completion of the task, but also to do it perfectly in quality and quantity!"</p><p></p><p>Ye Xiao nodded.</p><p></p><p>"Then let's start. All the divine crystals mined will be placed in the jade seal, which can hold them."</p><p></p><p>"Yes!"</p><p></p><p>With the order given, the star beasts began to dig the mine courageously.</p><p></p><p>Ye Xiao arranged them into several teams, each led by a super divine star beast, and then further divided into smaller teams led by divine beasts.</p><p></p><p>Layer by layer, he let them start digging the mine frantically.</p><p></p><p>Ye Xiao didn't have to worry about them running away, because his current cultivation has surpassed them by 100%, so he can use spiritual imprinting to control them and prevent them from escaping this place.</p><p></p><p>Then, Ye Xiao also divided out some spiritual body clones to assist in the excavation.</p><p></p><p>After all, the most important thing for him now is time.</p><p></p><p>He must seize the opportunity to take it away before other divine clans discover this place.</p><p></p><p>After arranging them to dig the mine underground, Ye Xiao set up a formation to shield it, then returned to the surface.</p><p></p><p>But he felt it was not enough.</p><p></p><p>The divine clans coming now are just some small fry, but it's not guaranteed that they won't send some big shots in the future.</p><p></p><p>With the increasingly fierce struggle in the starry sky, they may even dispatch divine king experts later! If they encounter that level of expert, what if they discover it? So Ye Xiao still needs to further enhance his formation.</p><p></p><p>Upgrading the formation to the treasure art level, this way he can ensure absolute safety.</p><p></p><p>Still need to read more books, sleep less, learn more, do less. It seems that Ye Xiao has to work harder in the library every day.</p><p></p><p>And treasure art, he still lacks one divine art of sword or one healing divine art, to be able to synthesize an ancient treasure art.</p><p></p><p>This makes Ye Xiao feel that he simply loves the library.</p><p></p><p>Not going out, not going out the second door.</p><p></p><p>Sitting every day, blowing air conditioning, reading books, reading books for free, warm in winter and cool in summer, not having to work, and still getting paid and fed.</p><p></p><p>Most importantly, his strength is also steadily increasing! Wonderful, wonderful!</p><p></p><p>One update, three thousand words.</p><p></p><p>Please recommend votes and monthly votes.</p><p></p><p>Thank you to the reader "Hai Di Wu Si Ji" for the reward, greatly appreciated.</p><p></p><p>(This chapter is complete)</p>

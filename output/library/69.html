        <h1>Chapter 69</h1>
        <div class="content">
            <p>Here is the full English translation of the Chinese excerpt:</p><p></p><p>The sword beam shot straight into the sky, like a meteor, tracing a dazzling and swift trajectory.</p><p></p><p>Two little babies on the rooftop were watching the stars when they saw this, and immediately cheered.</p><p></p><p>"Sister, sister, look quickly, there's a shooting star!"</p><p></p><p>"Wow! That really is a shooting star. When you see a shooting star, you should make a wish, and then the wish will come true."</p><p></p><p>"Mm! Shooting star, I hope you bring peace to the world, so that humans, beastmen, and star beasts can all live in harmony."</p><p></p><p>In the southwestern part of the Central Plains, at the border with Chu State, the vast Wanjiang Mountains.</p><p></p><p>A group of people, about a hundred or so, gathered in a corner of the forest.</p><p></p><p>"This time it's the Central Plains Garrison Army, the Chu State Garrison Army, and three private mercenary companies, joining forces for a group battle. The purpose is to completely eliminate the beastman organization, the Beast God Cult, from this mountain range.</p><p></p><p>To thoroughly eradicate the Beast God Cult, this time we've gathered sixteen masters, two grand masters, three spiritual masters, one high-level healer, six mid-level healers, and four hundred and thirty-five post-heaven warriors.</p><p></p><p>This lineup was painstakingly assembled after allocation from the higher-ups and joint efforts from the surrounding cities. It's a rare opportunity for us.</p><p></p><p>So no matter what, we have to bury the Beast God Cult in this Wanjiang Mountain! Do you understand?"</p><p></p><p>"We understand!"</p><p></p><p>"Good! The two warrior masters will lead the way, the spiritual masters will provide reconnaissance, advance!"</p><p></p><p>In the underground grand hall of the Beast God Cult, two stone tablets suddenly shattered, startling the gathered cult followers.</p><p></p><p>"What's going on?"</p><p></p><p>The Beast God on the high seat had an ice-cold expression.</p><p></p><p>"It's Charm Fox and Azure Wolf, they've been struck down."</p><p></p><p>"What! Charm Fox Master and Azure Wolf Master have been killed as well?"</p><p></p><p>"Those damned humans have killed our Beast God Cult followers again! We must kill them all to avenge the two masters!"</p><p></p><p>"Yes! Counterattack the humans, destroy Jianghai City!"</p><p></p><p>The Beast God was about to speak when he seemed to sense something, his expression hardening again.</p><p></p><p>"Just when one wave hasn't settled, another one arises. Humans have invaded! It seems I must teach these foolish humans a lesson!</p><p></p><p>Broadcast my divine decree, all Beast God Cult followers, to battle!"</p><p></p><p>With the order given, all the Beast God Cult followers in the underground rushed towards the surface.</p><p></p><p>"Kill all the humans!"</p><p>"Cleanse our Beast God Cult's divine might with human blood!"</p><p></p><p>The ground began to tremble slightly, causing the forces on the surface to abruptly halt their advance.</p><p></p><p>"Such a commotion, we've been discovered!"</p><p></p><p>"Everyone, enter combat formation!"</p><p></p><p>As soon as the words left the commander's mouth, one of the female warriors unexpectedly glanced up at the sky and couldn't help but ask in puzzlement:</p><p></p><p>"Huh? Commander, quick, look at that. What is it?"</p><p></p><p>Everyone looked up at the sky, only to see a shooting star streaking across, forming a parabolic arc in the sky before finally landing in the area in front of them.</p><p></p><p>On the ground, a dazzlingly bright sphere first rose up, followed by a thunderous roar.</p><p></p><p>Boom! A violent explosion, the earth trembling, the shockwave sweeping away trees with unstoppable force in all directions.</p><p></p><p>"Everyone, focus your qi in your dantian, steady your spirit, and firmly plant your feet. Grand masters and masters, deploy spiritual energy barriers for defense!"</p><p></p><p>The commander quickly issued tactical orders, and the group swiftly cooperated according to the tactics, with the grand masters and masters activating spiritual energy barriers for protection.</p><p></p><p>Here is the full English translation of the Chinese excerpt:</p><p></p><p>A wall of energy formed in front, used to block the shockwave.</p><p></p><p>Ye Xiao's cultivation level was too strong, with an amplification factor far exceeding ordinary cultivation methods. A single ordinary sword strike already possessed the strength to fight beyond its level. By condensing a large amount of spiritual energy and compressing the power of several moves into a single strike, its power had already reached the level of a true Saint Monarch's attack! Boom! The shockwave crashed against the energy wall, and even after traveling dozens of miles, it still caused several Sect Masters to have numb arms and turbulent qi and blood.</p><p></p><p>Only the Grand Sect Master and the team members hiding in the back were slightly better off, not being affected too greatly.</p><p></p><p>But even so, everyone was frightened out of their wits.</p><p></p><p>Such a powerful attack! This was truly divine retribution! Faced with this attack, their team was as insignificant as a group of ants.</p><p></p><p>One must know that their team's strength was not to be underestimated! But even so, they had no right to boast in the face of this attack.</p><p></p><p>Fortunately, this attack did not land on their heads, or else even with the Grand Sect Master and Sect Masters' defenses, not a single one of them would have survived.</p><p></p><p>The shockwave only lasted for an instant, passing by the group and continuing to spread out behind them, gradually weakening.</p><p></p><p>But the surrounding devastation testified to the immense power of that previous strike. The trees had been blown down by the massive shockwave, and those at the center of the explosion had been crushed into rubble.</p><p></p><p>A huge mushroom cloud rose from the center of the explosion.</p><p></p><p>"Quick, go take a look!"</p><p></p><p>The commander immediately ordered, and the group rushed forward, with the few Grand Sect Masters and Sect Masters taking the lead and directly breaking away from the team, heading towards the center of the explosion.</p><p></p><p>Under this explosion, the surrounding life had been virtually annihilated, so they did not need to worry about their team members being ambushed.</p><p></p><p>A few minutes later, the Grand Sect Master arrived first.</p><p></p><p>When they saw the massive crater blasted into the earth, they were all petrified.</p><p></p><p>The ground had been flattened, with no greenery or signs of life, only a bare, scorched earth. Due to the intense heat generated by the explosion, some areas had even been vitrified or turned to porcelain.</p><p></p><p>"Who did this? My goodness, this person has wiped out the entire Beastly God Sect!"</p><p></p><p>"Who? Who has this kind of power? It would take a Saint Monarch to produce such a result!"</p><p></p><p>Time flew by, and another night passed.</p><p></p><p>The Jianghai City was calm, and the entire Central Continent was peaceful as well.</p><p></p><p>The matter of the Beastly God Sect had not been made public.</p><p></p><p>The Saint Monarch was neither a Grand Sect Master nor a Sect Master, but had already reached the level of the top combat powers in the Nine Provinces and even the world.</p><p></p><p>Such high-level existences were few and far between, and they were extremely revered.</p><p></p><p>Their information and identities had to be strictly guarded as a top secret of the Nine Provinces. Only a select few would know about this.</p><p></p><p>As for Ye Xiao, he was carrying some fruits and coming to the hospital to visit Ning Yutian.</p><p></p><p>After the previous day's events, he had only healed Ning Yutian's arms and legs, leaving the remaining injuries for the hospital's healers to treat. With Ning Yutian's innate beast bloodline and the hospital's healing techniques, he would fully recover.</p><p></p><p>Sending him back to the library twice, even a fool could guess something.</p><p></p><p>This is the second update, please support me.</p><p></p><p>Thank you, fellow reader, for the reward. I'm deeply grateful.</p><p></p><p>(This chapter is complete)</p>

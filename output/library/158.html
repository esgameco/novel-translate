        <h1>Chapter 158</h1>
        <div class="content">
            <p>Here is the full English translation of the Chinese excerpt:</p><p></p><p>Who would have known that at that very moment, she had already fallen into the darkness of unconsciousness, only to be suddenly illuminated by a beam of light.</p><p></p><p>In that instant, Ji Feng couldn't help but reach out instinctively.</p><p></p><p>But it was that one action, and the next second, she was instantly back under the starry sky, in the middle of the forest.</p><p></p><p>Seeing Ye Xiao in front of her, Ji Feng was completely dumbfounded, plunged into deep doubts about life.</p><p></p><p>What happened? Didn't she already self-detonate her spiritual power? Her spiritual power was so powerful that it should have been able to shatter her soul into pieces. But now, she was still fine?</p><p></p><p>Was it Ye Xiao who had saved her and brought her back? He could even save a shattered soul?</p><p></p><p>In that moment of doubt about life, Ye Xiao's spiritual power suddenly formed a long spear and abruptly invaded her mind.</p><p></p><p>Boom—! "Ah~!"</p><p></p><p>Ji Feng screamed out loud. Damn it, she had just been stunned and hadn't had time to defend herself! The bastard had gotten in!</p><p></p><p>Ji Feng felt her soul being completely occupied by Ye Xiao's spiritual power.</p><p></p><p>She shed two clear tears.</p><p></p><p>I'm sorry, my fellow compatriots.</p><p></p><p>In the end, I was unable to protect my own memories.</p><p></p><p>I'm sorry, I tried my best, I really did.</p><p></p><p>But he was too strong.</p><p></p><p>Wuwuwuwu.</p><p></p><p>After scanning Ji Feng's spiritual power, Ye Xiao directly used the Taixuan Tiangong to shatter Ji Feng's soul again.</p><p></p><p>Then he threw her into his storage ring.</p><p></p><p>As long as her soul did not perish, he could revive her. Now it was time to go find the other few Godking-level spirit beasts.</p><p></p><p>Ye Xiao threw away the roasted wings he had finished eating, wiped his hands with a tissue.</p><p></p><p>"Silly cat, time to get to work."</p><p></p><p>"As you command."</p><p></p><p>Xuanliu immediately climbed onto Ye Xiao's shoulder, and with a thought, the Shenyi Technique was activated. Following the path in Ji Feng's memory, they flew swiftly towards the south.</p><p></p><p>On the other side, in the Ten Thousand Great Mountains of the Southern Frontier of the Nine Provinces...</p><p></p><p>A fierce battle was about to come to an end.</p><p></p><p>The participants in the battle were four Godking-level spirit beasts and the avatar of the Sword Sage of the Nine Provinces, Lu Qingshan.</p><p></p><p>The battle between the two sides had destroyed several surrounding mountains, leaving countless sword marks and attack traces on dozens of mountains.</p><p></p><p>One of the four Godking spirit beasts had fallen, one was severely injured, and the other two were slightly injured.</p><p></p><p>As for the avatar of Sword Sage Lu Qingshan, it was flickering, obviously having suffered a lot of attacks and was about to lose its form.</p><p></p><p>"Damn it! No wonder he is the Sword Sage of the Nine Provinces! To be able to form a killing avatar relying solely on his sword intent, and yet be able to reach this level. If his true body were to come, we would be slaughtered in minutes!"</p><p></p><p>"We are all Xiantian Seventh-Grade in strength, yet you as a single avatar can slay one of us, severely injure one, and lightly injure two. If your true body were to come, how could we possibly escape the Nine Provinces?"</p><p></p><p>"But unfortunately, you are not your true body. After we destroy your avatar, we three will flee the Nine Provinces, and let's see how you will find us then."</p><p></p><p>The avatar of Lu Qingshan's face was extremely grim.</p><p></p><p>His true body had reached a breakthrough point, so he could not leave the mountain.</p><p></p><p>He had originally intended to use his sword intent avatar to take down these escaped Godking spirit beasts one by one, but he never expected these Godking spirit beasts to unite together.</p><p></p><p>Four against one, disrupting his plan to eliminate them one by one.</p><p></p><p>If it was a one-on-one or even one-on-two fight, he would have full confidence in slaying all these spirit beasts.</p><p></p><p>But now, it seems impossible.</p><p></p><p>He was just a sword intent avatar, not the powerful Lu Qingshan himself. When the sword intent was scattered, the energy avatar would also perish.</p><p></p><p>What a pity, he couldn't completely annihilate them. If he let them escape, it would be like releasing a tiger back into the mountains.</p><p></p><p>Moreover, he had already alerted them, and they would be more vigilant in the future, making it much harder to capture them again.</p><p></p><p>He assessed his own strength, and with his current power, he might be able to slay the severely injured spirit beast in a life-or-death struggle.</p><p></p><p>If he could completely destroy it, leaving only two, the threat to the Nine Provinces would be somewhat reduced.</p><p></p><p>Thinking of this, he took a deep breath, and the energy body that had been flickering started to glow brighter.</p><p></p><p>The three spirit beasts exchanged a glance.</p><p></p><p>"Be careful, he's about to make a desperate final strike."</p><p></p><p>At their level of cultivation, after several rounds of battle and analysis, they were already intimately familiar with each other's every move.</p><p></p><p>Sure enough, the next moment, Lu Qingshan made his move.</p><p></p><p>Infused with a powerful sword intent, he thrust out a sword strike.</p><p></p><p>This sword strike was so dazzling that even the stars in the sky paled in comparison, stunningly beautiful!</p><p></p><p>"Such a powerful sword technique, we can't meet it head-on."</p><p></p><p>The three Godking spirit beasts exclaimed in alarm and immediately prepared to evade.</p><p></p><p>But just as the three spirit beasts were trying to dodge, the sword beam suddenly curved and shot straight towards the most severely injured spirit beast.</p><p></p><p>"Dixian Weng! He's targeting you! Quick, use the Subterranean Escape Technique!"</p><p></p><p>Dixian Weng wanted to use the Immortal-Grade Subterranean Escape Technique to burrow into the mountain, but it was already too late.</p><p></p><p>Here is my translation of the Chinese excerpt:</p><p></p><p>If he had not been injured, he could have easily evaded this sword strike, but now his injuries were so severe that he could barely circulate his spiritual energy without feeling excruciating pain.</p><p></p><p>It's over!</p><p></p><p>This was the thought of the three-headed celestial beast.</p><p></p><p>The Immortal Daoist Master was doomed.</p><p></p><p>A look of relief also appeared in Lü Qingshan's eyes. </p><p></p><p>This sword strike had concentrated his strongest sword intent, enough to slay the Immortal Daoist Master.</p><p></p><p>With that done, only the two divine sect celestial beasts would remain. He could then attach his remaining sword intent to them, and after breaking through, go hunt down and destroy those two divine sect celestial beasts without much difficulty.</p><p></p><p>But at this critical moment, suddenly a sword beam shot down from the starry sky, colliding head-on with his sword beam.</p><p></p><p>Boom! The two collided, generating an immensely powerful shockwave that directly blew the three celestial beasts away. The brilliant light quickly spread through the night sky of the great mountains, once again deeply shocking the countless living beings who had witnessed the battle between Lü Qingshan and the four celestial beasts.</p><p></p><p>Boom, boom, boom. Accompanied by three violent explosions, the three celestial beasts were each sent crashing through three great mountains. But for their divine sect physiques, this posed no hindrance at all.</p><p></p><p>Instead, it allowed the Immortal Daoist Master to evade Lü Qingshan's fatal strike.</p><p></p><p>"What's going on? Who intervened?"</p><p></p><p>"Could it be one of the big shots of our celestial beast clan?"</p><p></p><p>Lü Qingshan's sword intent clone was growing increasingly weak, almost to the point of transparency. </p><p></p><p>But his expression was grave as he intently watched the scene before him.</p><p></p><p>His expression had never been this serious before.</p><p></p><p>That sword beam he had just witnessed, among all the enemies he had encountered in his life, its sword intent would definitely rank in the top three!</p><p></p><p>But that was not what concerned him.</p><p></p><p>What truly concerned him was that he had never seen this sword intent before.</p><p></p><p>In other words, this was a completely new sword dao master!</p><p></p><p>Unexpectedly, besides the Sword Sovereign Azure Dragon and himself, another such sword dao expert had emerged in the Nine Provinces.</p><p></p><p>His gaze burned with excitement, as he wanted to know who this person was.</p><p></p><p>The next moment, Ye Xiao stepped out from the void.</p><p></p><p>"Such incredible speed!"</p><p></p><p>Lü Qingshan's heart trembled, deeply impressed by Ye Xiao's speed.</p><p></p><p>With his experience, he could clearly sense that Ye Xiao's cultivation had not yet reached the peak of the Xian Immortal Realm, his aura was not strong enough.</p><p></p><p>Yet his speed was even on par with Lü Qingshan's own main body, which had reached the peak of the Xian Immortal Realm.</p><p></p><p>This guy had some real potential.</p><p></p><p>Lü Qingshan felt a surge of excitement.</p><p></p><p>This was the feeling of two strong experts encountering each other - a mutual admiration. It had been so long since he had last experienced this.</p><p></p><p>And now, he was feeling it again.</p><p></p><p>How thrilling.</p><p></p><p>But when he saw the other's appearance, he couldn't help but be taken aback.</p><p></p><p>It wasn't that he thought the other was a stranger, but rather that he was so young!</p><p></p><p>Lü Qingshan had lived for hundreds of years, and his ability to read bones was naturally far superior to that of ordinary Xian Immortals.</p><p></p><p>Even though he was just a clone here, he could still clearly see.</p><p></p><p>The other was very young!</p><p></p><p>This stirred up a tumultuous storm in Lü Qingshan's heart.</p><p></p><p>This youth had actually reached this level of cultivation! Heavens, in the entire history of the Nine Provinces, those who could achieve this were as rare as phoenix feathers and qilin horns!</p><p></p><p>In his own time, he had only reached the Seventh Grade of the Xian Immortal Realm when he first entered the Xian Immortal Realm, at the age of thirty.</p><p></p><p>Even so, he had now become a renowned Sword Saint, ranked tenth on the World Dragon Rankings. What was even more terrifying was that at thirty years old, he had only just barely entered the Seventh Grade of the Xian Immortal Realm.</p><p></p><p>But this youth's cultivation was definitely not limited to just the Seventh Grade.</p><p></p><p>This child... could he really be human? Or was he some ancient supreme celestial beast, or the imperial bloodline born from a peerless human expert? Lü Qingshan was not exaggerating - in all the geniuses he had encountered over the centuries of traveling the world, not a single one could compare to this youth.</p><p></p><p>Even the one he wholeheartedly admired, the Number One of the Nine Provinces and the World, the Sword Sovereign Azure Dragon, paled in comparison before this youth. Ye Xiao had never imagined that his arrival would send Lü Qingshan into such deep contemplation.</p><p></p><p>He had only used the Grand Celestial Sword Qi to sense that the other had already slain one Xian Immortal Realm celestial beast. If he let him slay another, how would Ye Xiao be able to raise those celestial beasts?</p><p></p><p>He had paid such a huge price just to capture a few more Xian Immortal Realm celestial beasts.</p><p></p><p>So he had hurriedly struck out that sword beam to stop the other from annihilating the Immortal Daoist Master.</p><p></p><p>However, seeing Lü Qingshan's sword intent clone, he couldn't help but be somewhat surprised as well.</p><p></p><p>The Grand Celestial Sword Qi had already scanned and determined that the other was just a sword intent clone, not the main body.</p>

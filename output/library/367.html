        <div class="content">
            <p>Here is the full English translation of the Chinese excerpt:</p><p></p><p>Not only was Ye Xiao completely eliminated, but the time it took was also very short!</p><p></p><p>This further demonstrates his cultivation, which is terrifyingly strong.</p><p></p><p>Emperor Jing couldn't help but sigh:</p><p></p><p>"It seems we have truly grown old and can no longer keep up with your pace. We had just thought of the first point, but you had already reached the third point, or even the tenth."</p><p></p><p>North Hall Ce praised:</p><p></p><p>"However, does this not also prove that Emperor Yun and our esteemed predecessors, as well as the ancestors of our Nineå·žpeople, did not make a mistake in their choice?"</p><p></p><p>Emperor Jing nodded.</p><p></p><p>"That is also true."</p><p></p><p>Ye Xiao looked at the two.</p><p></p><p>"However, even so, we cannot be careless.</p><p></p><p>Although this time I have killed them all and even shattered their souls, making it impossible for them to revive,</p><p></p><p>the people of the Three Divine Tribes will certainly not give up easily.</p><p></p><p>If my guess is correct, they will definitely send people over soon.</p><p></p><p>I don't know if the Ning family can withstand it, and the Ning family should also increase their troops, but whether they can make it in time or catch up is a very serious problem.</p><p></p><p>We don't even know if the Ning family will pay attention to this matter, which is why I didn't let you mention the incident of North Hall Senior's eyes being taken."</p><p></p><p>Emperor Jing nodded.</p><p></p><p>"We all must not be negligent and must continue to cultivate even harder."</p><p></p><p>After a brief conversation with the two seniors, Ye Xiao took his leave.</p><p></p><p>He still needed to continue cultivating and strengthening his own strength.</p><p></p><p>On the other side, in the starry sky, at the base of the Three Divine Tribes, after all the blood on the ground had been completely absorbed, the aura of death grew stronger and stronger! Finally, when the aura of death had condensed to a certain degree, the earth suddenly cracked open, and a huge fish-like body emerged from the ground, transforming into a brilliant azure light that soared freely in the sky.</p><p></p><p>"Hahaha, I, the Sovereign, have finally emerged. Over two thousand years! Entire two thousand years! I was trapped in this boundless formation, and my bones were almost rusted.</p><p></p><p>Unexpectedly, this time I have such good luck, obtaining powerful blood energy, and thus being reborn."</p><p></p><p>As he spoke, his gaze turned to the vast human realm, and a bloodthirsty chill emanated from his eyes.</p><p></p><p>"In the past, I was out of luck, colliding with that demonic prodigy, the Ancestor Dragon, who suppressed me here for over two thousand years.</p><p></p><p>Now, more than two thousand years have passed, and the Ancestor Dragon should have long since left the human realm.</p><p></p><p>Perfect, I will go and slaughter all the humans on the ground! Devour all his descendants."</p><p></p><p>As he said this, he couldn't help but swallow a mouthful of saliva.</p><p></p><p>"The human race is the same clan as the Ancestor Dragon, and they must possess the same bloodline power as him. If I can find his direct descendants, that would be even more perfect. Hehe, I haven't tasted human flesh for over two thousand years.</p><p></p><p>If I can conquer the human race this time, I can't kill them all, I must raise and domesticate them properly.</p><p></p><p>Only in this way can I eat human flesh every day in the future."</p><p></p><p>His mind had already conceived many practical methods.</p><p></p><p>Stewing, frying, braising, frying, marinating... Oh yes, he could also eat them raw.</p><p></p><p>At this moment, several figures slowly flew in from the distance.</p><p></p><p>The eyes of the star beasts flashed with a bloodthirsty light.</p><p></p><p>"Speak of the devil, and he appears. I was just in need of blood energy, and you've come to me of your own accord. Wonderful!"</p><p></p><p>He swung his huge tail, turning into a beam of light and rushing towards them.</p><p></p><p>Back on the ground, Ye Xiao had been reading in the library for nearly half a month, but still couldn't find the last healing technique.</p><p></p><p>Instead, he found another alchemical divine technique - Yin Yang Creation.</p><p></p><p>Healing techniques were really too difficult to find, to be precise, there were very few people cultivating them, so the demand was not high, resulting in their scarcity.</p><p></p><p>Not to mention other things, at least alchemy can make money, and forging can also make money, exchanging for spirit crystals.</p><p></p><p>This is a good survival skill.</p><p></p><p>But healing techniques? You have to stay close to the other person to work, and a single person can't possibly carry a healer around, it's too troublesome, it's better to carry two pills.</p><p></p><p>Those who can use healing techniques can basically be considered as part of the army.</p><p></p><p>However, being with them is also not safe, and you may even be killed.</p><p></p><p>So from this point of view, many people's desire to cultivate healing techniques has been eliminated.</p><p></p><p>In short, although healing techniques are very powerful, they are an unloved and unwanted role.</p><p></p><p>What puzzles Ye Xiao even more is that even after obtaining an alchemical technique, allowing his alchemy to accumulate two techniques, no new techniques that can be synthesized have appeared.</p><p></p><p>According to the previous synthesis rules,</p><p></p><p>Sword techniques and Dao techniques, Body techniques and Healing techniques, are two categories of four techniques that can be synthesized into a precious technique.</p><p></p><p>But this time, the alchemical technique did not react with other techniques, and the alchemical technique is something that can...</p><p></p><p>Here is the full English translation of the Chinese excerpt:</p><p></p><p>So, who exactly is capable of truly synthesizing alchemy? And how can it be combined with certain cultivation methods?</p><p></p><p>Ye Xiao was genuinely perplexed.</p><p></p><p>The excavation progress of the Divine Realm Treasure Vault had already reached 80%, but it would still take a long time to fully uncover it.</p><p></p><p>And his spiritual energy cultivation progress had not yet reached the Third Realm of the Divine Realm.</p><p></p><p>Although he had alchemy techniques that could accelerate his own cultivation progress and allow him to easily surpass others, Ye Xiao had previously thought that each advancement in the Divine Realm would be as fast as reaching the First Realm. But in reality, his assumptions were a bit too simplistic.</p><p></p><p>The truth is, the further one cultivates, the more spiritual energy is required for each subsequent stage.</p><p></p><p>In other words, Ye Xiao had lost a major supplement - the blood energy of the Star Beasts! Previously, by relying on the combined power of the Star Beast blood energy and his cultivation techniques, he was able to cultivate at an extremely rapid pace.</p><p></p><p>But now, without the Star Beast blood energy, his cultivation speed would undoubtedly slow down significantly.</p><p></p><p>Yet Ye Xiao was truly helpless in this situation. Not only had he already arranged for the Star Beasts to go mining, even if they weren't mining, their blood energy would not be enough to sustain his own needs.</p><p></p><p>He required even more powerful Star Beasts! </p><p></p><p>At least ones comparable to those above the Divine Realm, whose blood energy could adequately replenish his own.</p><p></p><p>But just as Ye Xiao was reading, a few voices suddenly reached his ears in discussion.</p><p></p><p>"Hey, have you heard? They say a Beast Sovereign has appeared in the starry sky!"</p><p></p><p>"A Beast Sovereign? What's that?"</p><p></p><p>"You don't know what a Beast Sovereign is? How outdated! A Beast Sovereign is an existence comparable to the Divine Realm experts of the human race."</p><p></p><p>"Heavens, you can't be serious! The Star Beasts actually have such powerful beings? Wasn't it said that if Star Beasts break through the Divine Realm, they would become part of the Divine Clan?"</p><p></p><p>"It's not quite like that. Star Beasts and humans share a common point - if they successfully break through, they can become divine. But if they fail the tribulation, they will either be blasted to smithereens by lightning or disintegrate into scattered cultivators.</p><p></p><p>For human martial artists who fail the tribulation and disintegrate, they are called Immortals of the Mortal Realm, and they still have a chance to break through and become divine again in the future.</p><p></p><p>But for Star Beasts who fail the tribulation and disintegrate, they become Beast Sovereigns. Once a Star Beast becomes divine, their cultivation path from then on is the same as other divine clans - Divine Realm, Slay the Divine, Divine King, Divine Emperor.</p><p></p><p>However, if a Star Beast becomes a Beast Sovereign, it takes a different path - they can no longer break through to become divine, and will gradually grow into a vast void beast roaming the starry skies."</p><p></p><p>"I see, so this Beast Sovereign must be incredibly powerful then!"</p><p></p><p>"Powerful is an understatement! They say this one has been rampaging through the starry sky, causing heavy losses to the five major powers like the Divine Wood Academy. Even the Ning Clan was affected.</p><p></p><p>In the end, it was only after a Divine Realm expert from the Ning Clan fought it at great cost and sustained severe injuries that they were able to drive it back."</p><p></p><p>"Heavens! A disintegrated Star Beast is actually this strong? It's a good thing our strength is so lacking that we don't qualify to go to the starry sky battlefield, or else we might have been devoured by it."</p><p></p><p>"That's right. Sometimes being weak isn't so bad - at least we're less likely to end up dead."</p><p></p><p>"Haha haha."</p><p></p><p>Hearing these words, Ye Xiao couldn't help but narrow his eyes.</p><p></p><p>"A Beast Sovereign? How intriguing."</p><p></p><p>If what they said was true, and this being had blood energy comparable to Divine Realm experts, capturing it to replenish his own blood energy would be absolutely wonderful! He could try cooking it in various ways - frying, stewing, braising, deep-frying, or even eating it raw like sashimi or drunken shrimp. </p><p></p><p>Of course, the prerequisite would be that the meat had to taste good. If it was something like a bat, no matter how good the blood energy, Ye Xiao wouldn't even put it in his mouth. He was afraid of getting sick, and it would be too miserable to die from eating after transmigrating here.</p><p></p><p>If the meat quality was good, he could even consider setting up a dedicated breeding ground to raise it. He could use the old method of eating it and then healing the wounds with his spiritual energy, so that only the meat would grow back.</p><p></p><p>Perfect!</p><p></p><p>The only question was whether he would have the luck to encounter it.</p><p></p><p>Meanwhile, in the starry sky, the air suddenly distorted as over a thousand spiritual energy ships rapidly gathered from three directions. The ships bore different emblems - some had lightning shapes, some had flying wing shapes, and some had giant ape shapes.</p><p></p><p>The members of the three major divine clans had arrived in this region of the starry sky.</p>

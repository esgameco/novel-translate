        <h1>Chapter 154</h1>
        <div class="content">
            <p>Here is the full English translation of the Chinese excerpt:</p><p></p><p>"Cough, cough, that's certainly not mine, I don't have such a strange fetish to sell my own clothes and socks."</p><p></p><p>Ye Xiao already had a rather unpleasant premonition.</p><p></p><p>Indeed, if Huan Liuli was selling things she no longer wanted, even if she wore ten pairs a day, how much could she have made?</p><p></p><p>This stuff can't be mass-produced either.</p><p></p><p>But Huan Liuli still earned so much money, so there must be some hidden story.</p><p></p><p>"Where did you get this from exactly?"</p><p></p><p>Huan Liuli grinned mischievously and whispered in Ye Xiao's ear, "Business secret. But I can tell the master. It's actually..."</p><p></p><p>"Clack."</p><p></p><p>After hearing what Huan Liuli said, Ye Xiao's entire worldview was thrown into disarray, and the spicy fried skewers in his hand were all thrown to the ground.</p><p></p><p>Huan Liuli looked pained.</p><p></p><p>"Master, why did you throw away all the skewers? Such a waste."</p><p></p><p>"Don't say anything, I feel like vomiting."</p><p></p><p>Time passed quickly, and it was soon evening. After Huan Liuli comforted him for a long time and finally swore that she would never do such a despicable thing again, Ye Xiao finally calmed down a bit and didn't feel as bad.</p><p></p><p>"Master, should we eat something else? You only had a little of the fried skewers before throwing them away."</p><p></p><p>"You can eat, I don't have much appetite."</p><p></p><p>Ye Xiao found a park bench to sit down on, took out a bottle of water from his storage ring, cleared his throat, and then began to cast a disguise spell.</p><p></p><p>After all, this was not his hometown of Jianghai City, but Jiuzhou, a place where talented people abounded. It would be best not to expose his identity here if possible.</p><p></p><p>He had read some information before.</p><p></p><p>In Jiuzhou, there were some top-tier experts whose strength was not inferior to the peak of the Divine Sect. </p><p></p><p>In the World Dragon Ranking, Liu Chengxun and Murakami Hitomi only occupied the 49th and 50th places respectively.</p><p></p><p>But in Jiuzhou alone, there were as many as seventeen people occupying the Dragon and Phoenix Rankings.</p><p></p><p>Most of them were ranked near the top of the rankings.</p><p></p><p>Like the Sword Sovereign Qinglong, ranked first in the World Dragon Ranking.</p><p>The Fire Blade Zhuque, ranked first in the World Phoenix Ranking.</p><p>The Thunder Tiger Baihu, ranked third in the World Phoenix Ranking.</p><p>The Diamond Xuanwu, ranked third in the World Dragon Ranking.</p><p></p><p>A little lower were the Sword Saint Lu Qingshan, ranked 10th in the World Dragon Ranking, and the Sword God Li Liushui, ranked 9th.</p><p></p><p>In addition, there were several more in the 10th to 20th and 20th to 30th intervals.</p><p></p><p>It was said that in the past, there were even more of these powerful experts, numerous as the hairs on a cow, to the point of being able to look down on other states. With such a powerful martial arts culture, it's no wonder the other states targeted them! Because they were too strong, completely unrivaled. They had already posed a fatal threat to the others.</p><p></p><p>It's not that Jiuzhou was wrong, but human hearts are wicked. When you are too dazzling, it's inevitable that you will attract envy.</p><p></p><p>Now he was the same.</p><p></p><p>In this world where people only reach the Divine Sect realm after nearly a hundred years of cultivation, a Divine Sect cultivator in his early twenties, who could guarantee that others wouldn't have any ideas about him?</p><p></p><p>Normally, in the small town of Jianghai City, he didn't have to worry about encountering any powerful experts. But now that he had come out, he naturally had to be more careful.</p><p></p><p>After Ye Xiao finished casting the disguise spell, he suddenly found a three-year-old little girl standing in front of him, staring at him with wide eyes, full of wonder.</p><p></p><p>"Wow! Uncle, you're so amazing, your face can actually turn into another person's!"</p><p></p><p>Ye Xiao: "(￣.￣)!"</p><p></p><p>"Uncle, can you turn into another person again?"</p><p></p><p>Ye Xiao patted the little girl's head.</p><p></p><p>"You must have seen wrong."</p><p></p><p>"But I just saw you turn into another person!"</p><p></p><p>After a moment of thought, Ye Xiao took a candy from his storage ring and handed it to the little girl.</p><p></p><p>"Here, just pretend you didn't see anything, okay? You can't tell anyone about this."</p><p></p><p>The little girl, now excited after receiving the candy, nodded earnestly.</p><p></p><p>"Okay."</p><p></p><p>"Then let's make a pinky promise, and it will last a hundred years without breaking."</p><p></p><p>The little girl very solemnly hooked her pinky with Ye Xiao's, as if they had just made an important contract.</p><p></p><p>"Where's your mom? Why are you alone?"</p><p></p><p>"Mommy went to the restroom."</p><p></p><p>Just as she said that, a young, attractive mother hurriedly came out of the restroom in the distance, calling out loudly:</p><p></p><p>"Xiao Yi, where did you go?"</p><p></p><p>"Mommy, I'm here."</p><p></p><p>The little girl waved her small hand, and the young mother quickly came over. She glanced at Ye Xiao, then at the candy in her daughter Xiao Yi's hand, and immediately spoke:</p><p></p><p>"Xiao Yi, did you take something from someone again?"</p><p></p><p>She then apologized to Ye Xiao while asking her daughter to return the candy.</p><p></p><p>"I'm very sorry, my daughter is a bit mischievous. Xiao Yi, quickly return the candy to the uncle."</p><p></p><p>But Xiao Yi hid her hand behind her back, refusing to give it back.</p><p></p><p>"No, this is the candy the uncle gave me."</p><p></p><p>Ye Xiao smiled and said, "The candy really is something I gave her."</p><p></p><p>The mother then stopped her actions and thanked Ye Xiao instead.</p><p></p><p>"Thank you for giving my daughter the candy."</p><p></p><p>"You're welcome, she's very cute."</p><p></p><p>The mother smiled and gently patted her daughter Xiao Yi's little head.</p><p></p><p>"Xiao Yi, did you thank the uncle?"</p><p></p><p>Xiao Yi immediately replied in a childish voice, "Thank you, uncle."</p><p></p><p>Here is the full English translation of the Chinese excerpt:</p><p></p><p>"Thank you, uncle," Nai Qi nodded.</p><p></p><p>"You're welcome."</p><p></p><p>At this moment, Huan Liuli came running back, a sausage hanging from her mouth. When Little Yi saw her, her big eyes went wide.</p><p></p><p>"Wow! What a cute kitty! Uncle, is this your cat? Can I pet her?"</p><p></p><p>Ye Xiao glanced at Huan Liuli and nodded.</p><p></p><p>Little Yi immediately hugged Huan Liuli, excitedly showing her to her mother like a proud parent.</p><p></p><p>"Mommy, the kitty is so soft!"</p><p></p><p>Little Yi's mother crouched down to comfort her daughter.</p><p></p><p>"Well, when you grow up, we'll get a cat too."</p><p></p><p>"Yay!" </p><p></p><p>Little Yi was exceptionally excited, unwilling to let go of Huan Liuli.</p><p></p><p>Ye Xiao looked at the mother and daughter, a sense of warmth welling up within him.</p><p></p><p>Warm familial affection was always the most infectious. </p><p></p><p>Especially for someone like Ye Xiao, who had spent his previous life bedridden, and this life solely focused on cultivation, a solitary existence - the warmth of such familial love resonated with him deeply.</p><p></p><p>Those who have never experienced such things often yearn for the beauty of it the most.</p><p></p><p>Little Yi played with Huan Liuli for quite a while, when suddenly Ye Xiao's expression changed, his gaze sharpening.</p><p></p><p>It was Ji Feng's aura.</p><p></p><p>That old hen had finally left her nest.</p><p></p><p>As Huan Liuli was Ye Xiao's star beast, she naturally sensed the shift in his mood, letting out a "meow" and leaping onto his shoulder.</p><p></p><p>Little Yi hurried over.</p><p></p><p>"Kitty, kitty, let's play together!"</p><p></p><p>Little Yi's mother seemed to sense Ye Xiao's serious expression, and quickly came over.</p><p></p><p>"Little Yi, it's very late, the uncle needs to go home, and we should go home too."</p><p></p><p>"But I want to keep playing with the kitty."</p><p></p><p>Little Yi, still a young girl, was clearly a bit upset, her big eyes quickly brimming with tears.</p><p></p><p>Her mother patiently coaxed her.</p><p></p><p>"No, the uncle really has to go home now."</p><p></p><p>"Can the uncle come to our house then?"</p><p></p><p>At this, Little Yi seemed to have discovered a new world, immediately grabbing Ye Xiao's arm.</p><p></p><p>"Uncle, you can be my dad, then we'll be a family and I can always play with the kitty."</p><p></p><p>Little Yi's mother's face instantly flushed bright red.</p><p></p><p>"Little Yi, what nonsense are you spouting?"</p><p></p><p>Ye Xiao pinched Little Yi's little cheek.</p><p></p><p>"No, because Little Yi already has a dad."</p><p></p><p>"But Little Yi doesn't have a dad anymore."</p><p></p><p>"Ah."</p><p></p><p>Ye Xiao looked at Little Yi's mother, seeing something in her gaze.</p><p></p><p>Another single-parent family.</p><p></p><p>"Little Yi, don't talk nonsense anymore."</p><p></p><p>"I'm not talking nonsense, the uncle is very handsome, and just now Mommy kept stealing glances at him."</p><p></p><p>Little Yi's mother's face reddened even more.</p><p></p><p>"You little rascal, you're talking more and more nonsense. We're going home, Grandma made you a fruit salad, and if it gets too late it won't taste good anymore."</p><p></p><p>"Can the uncle come home with us to eat the fruit salad?"</p><p></p><p>Ye Xiao was silent for a moment, then replied:</p><p></p><p>"The uncle still has work to do, I'll come eat it another time when I'm free."</p><p></p><p>"Then let's pinky promise."</p><p></p><p>Ye Xiao nodded, pacifying them and seeing the mother and daughter off. After they left, he released his Taixuan Tiangong, beginning to search for Ji Feng's location.</p><p></p><p>"Master, I feel the star beast bloodline within me boiling."</p><p></p><p>"There seems to be something amiss. I can't locate the spiritual power I had placed on Ji Feng anymore. The star beast magnetic field in the entire Luofeng City is very strong, almost like a Seven-Star Convergence."</p><p></p><p>"Among our star beasts, when this kind of situation occurs, it means there is an extremely powerful star beast whose bloodline power has been activated. This is a kind of self-sacrificing behavior, but it will grant a significant boost to all the star beasts in the surrounding area."</p><p></p><p>"Rumor has it that Luofeng City once had a Phoenix slain, its bloodline power likely far exceeding that of an ordinary Dragon-level bloodline.</p><p></p><p>Could it be that Ji Feng has found the place where that Phoenix fell?"</p><p></p><p>"It's possible. The Phoenix has been sealed for hundreds of years, and with its injuries, it may no longer be able to survive much longer. In such a situation, sacrificing its own bloodline to empower the star beasts in the area is understandable."</p><p></p><p>At this time, screams began to echo through the streets.</p><p></p><p>"Star beasts, there are star beasts!"</p><p>"Help, someone save us!"</p><p></p><p>The cries rang out one after another.</p><p></p><p>Luofeng City was not like Jianghai City, where with Ye Xiao present, not a single star beast had managed to intrude during the Seven-Star Convergence. But Luofeng City had star beasts breaking in, and it was the same in other cities - the star beasts could not all be slain at once, they had only hidden, waiting for the next opportunity to counterattack humanity.</p><p></p><p>And now, the Phoenix star beast in Luofeng City had activated its bloodline power, directly causing the hidden star beasts to unleash their strength and burst out to attack the humans.</p><p></p><p>"Ji Feng is the one I let go, and although I don't know how she managed to release the Phoenix bloodline in Luofeng City, it is still somewhat related to me.</p><p></p><p>Liuli, clean up the area."</p><p></p><p>"Understood."</p><p></p><p>This is the end of the first update, 3,000 words. </p><p></p><p>Thank you to the reader Small Po for the reward, I am deeply grateful.</p>

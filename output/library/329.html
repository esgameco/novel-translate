        <h1>Chapter 329</h1>
        <div class="content">
            <p>Here is the full English translation of the Chinese excerpt:</p><p></p><p>Liu Chengxun's heart trembled.</p><p></p><p>Although he was not Ye Xiao and did not have the same powerful strength, there was one thing he was very clear about.</p><p></p><p>That is, for an existence like Ye Xiao, if there is any bad premonition, it is basically true.</p><p></p><p>"Do you want to go take a look?" </p><p></p><p>Ye Xiao nodded.</p><p></p><p>"Yes, I should go take a look. You go back first."</p><p></p><p>"Be careful and stay safe."</p><p></p><p>Liu Chengxun gave a caring reminder.</p><p></p><p>This was all he could do now.</p><p></p><p>As soon as the words left his mouth, Ye Xiao had disappeared from his side.</p><p></p><p>Seeing this scene, Liu Chengxun couldn't help but bitterly smile. He could no longer keep up with Ye Xiao's speed.</p><p></p><p>He didn't even have any reaction to when Ye Xiao left.</p><p></p><p>By the time he realized it, Ye Xiao was already gone.</p><p></p><p>"Ah! I'm getting old! The future will belong to Ye Xiao. I, a peak Xiantian Ninth-Grade Saint Monarch, am nothing at all now."</p><p></p><p>At the same time, in the starry sky, Jing Emperor and Yun Emperor were being constantly pursued and attacked by numerous super divine star beasts, and their injuries were continuously increasing.</p><p></p><p>Although the two were already veteran Empyrean Realm experts with several dragon auras, they were still unable to withstand the onslaught of so many super divine star beasts.</p><p></p><p>The most important thing was that they only had the divine art of the Xuanyuan Ancestor passed down to them, the Xuanyuan Sword Technique.</p><p></p><p>This sword technique was not even the Xuanyuan Ancestor's strongest one! His truly strongest sword art was sealed within the Empyrean Stele.</p><p></p><p>That supreme divine art was something that they, as Empyrean Realm experts, had no qualifications to access. Only the legendary Mandate Child, the one chosen by the ancestor, would have the chance to obtain that supreme divine art.</p><p></p><p>In the ancestor's words, the Xuanyuan Sword Technique was just an extremely common sword art within the Xuanyuan Clan.</p><p></p><p>Although this sword art was far superior in power to Empyrean Arts, the two of them simply did not have enough time to unleash it! The number of pursuers was simply too many, and they were too powerful.</p><p></p><p>Most importantly, they did not have a divine art-level cultivation method like Ye Xiao's that could instantly replenish a massive amount of spiritual energy.</p><p></p><p>When they unleashed divine arts, their spiritual energy would directly decrease by a significant fraction.</p><p></p><p>After just a few uses, their spiritual energy would be completely depleted.</p><p></p><p>In this situation, even if they had the time to unleash it, they would not dare to do so recklessly, as that would only put them in an even more passive position.</p><p></p><p>But if they continued like this, they would not be able to hold out for long.</p><p></p><p>The star beasts behind them were unleashing Empyrean Arts with each attack.</p><p></p><p>They could only continue flying forward while constantly turning back to counterattack with Empyrean Arts to block them.</p><p></p><p>But to counter the attacks of dozens of super divine beings, each of them had to unleash over twenty Empyrean Arts, greatly increasing their consumption.</p><p></p><p>Their spiritual energy was constantly depleting, and their strength and speed were gradually weakening.</p><p></p><p>"We can't go on like this."</p><p></p><p>Yun Emperor gritted his teeth and flew in front of Jing Emperor.</p><p></p><p>"Jing Emperor, lend me your strength!"</p><p></p><p>"Okay!"</p><p></p><p>Jing Emperor knew that Yun Emperor was going to unleash the Xuanyuan Sword Technique, which would definitely put some pressure on the opponents.</p><p></p><p>He exerted all his strength and continuously unleashed attacks.</p><p></p><p>Unfortunately, his individual power was ultimately too weak to withstand so many star beasts.</p><p></p><p>Yun Emperor's Xuanyuan Sword Technique had not fully formed yet, and after Jing Emperor broke through dozens of Empyrean Arts, he was accidentally hit by one.</p><p></p><p>The next moment, his entire rhythm was disrupted, and one Empyrean Art after another bombarded him, causing him to continuously spit blood.</p><p></p><p>And with Jing Emperor's resistance gone, Yun Emperor also came under attack! The super divine star beasts were intelligent enough, they were not fools.</p><p></p><p>Knowing that once Yun Emperor unleashed the divine art, it would pose a fatal threat to them, they immediately shifted their focus of attack to Yun Emperor.</p><p></p><p>Boom, boom, boom...</p><p></p><p>One Empyrean Art after another frantically bombarded the two of them.</p><p></p><p>"No—!"</p><p></p><p>Yun Emperor let out a roar, his eyes filled with hatred.</p><p></p><p>He was just about to unleash the divine art of the Xuanyuan Clan—the Xuanyuan Sword Technique! But unfortunately, he ultimately failed.</p><p></p><p>All opportunities were lost, and all hope was shattered.</p><p></p><p>The super divine star beasts were getting closer and closer.</p><p></p><p>Humanity was completely powerless to turn the tide.</p><p></p><p>All the struggles of the past thousands of years would be in vain in this moment.</p><p></p><p>Despair enveloped Yun Emperor's heart.</p><p></p><p>"Yun Emperor, I'm sorry. It's my uselessness that prevented me from blocking their attacks, causing you to be unable to unleash the Xuanyuan Sword Technique."</p><p></p><p>Yun Emperor gave a bitter smile.</p><p></p><p>"At this point, what's the use of saying these things, senior? With so many super divine star beasts here, even if it was me, I wouldn't be able to resist successfully. It seems that Heaven wants the destruction of humanity. No matter how hard we try, it's all in vain."</p><p></p><p>Here is my translation of the Chinese excerpt:</p><p></p><p>"Haha, since the heavens want to take back this life, then let them take it back. I won't play along with them anymore!"</p><p></p><p>In the final moments of his life, the Emperor Jing let go of everything, achieving the utmost detachment.</p><p></p><p>Influenced by Emperor Jing, Emperor Yun also gave up his resistance.</p><p></p><p>He forcefully endured the pain in his body and looked back at the Nine Provinces one last time. </p><p></p><p>Since death was now unavoidable, then so be it! As an emperor and a descendant of the Xuanyuan clan, he would face death without any feminine airs. But before dying, he at least wanted to take one last look at the homeland that had haunted his dreams.</p><p></p><p>However, just as he turned his head to take that final look, his entire body suddenly trembled.</p><p></p><p>"Emperor Jing, do you believe that miracles exist in this world?"</p><p></p><p>Emperor Jing raised his eyebrows slightly.</p><p></p><p>"What did you-"</p><p></p><p>Before he could finish his words, in the next moment, a shocking sword beam suddenly shot up into the sky, directly confronting the powerful Supernal Beast expert descending from above.</p><p></p><p>The elegance of that sword strike was unparalleled in the world - magnificent and extraordinary! With an unstoppable and invincible momentum, it collided with the imperial art of the Supernal Beast.</p><p></p><p>The first imperial art was ruthlessly cleaved open!</p><p></p><p>Then the second, third, and fourth imperial arts, until it had split through them all, surging forward fearlessly into the center of the Supernal Beast.</p><p></p><p>This sword beam was simply too fast. </p><p></p><p>The first Supernal Beast couldn't even react before it was split in two, cut clean in half.</p><p></p><p>The last Supernal Beast also couldn't withstand this strike, its head being sliced off on the spot. The third Supernal Beast, positioned farthest in the back, was barely able to react in time.</p><p></p><p>It immediately tried to dodge to the side.</p><p></p><p>But its hopes were in vain, for the sword qi of this strike was so sharp, so unfathomably keen, that even the entire area within a ten-mile radius could not escape it.</p><p></p><p>So after dodging the sword, the moment it bared its fangs, in the next second its entire left side, from its thigh to its shoulder, was cleaved open.</p><p></p><p>"Nooo!" it let out a terrified, agonized scream, its very soul nearly shattering.</p><p></p><p>What kind of sword technique was this? It was so horrifying! This Supernal Beast had refined the divine blood of countless human cultivators, advancing to the Supernal Realm! At this powerful level, it should have been able to match even Imperial Realm experts with its imperial arts. Yet it had been grievously wounded in a single strike, beyond all its expectations.</p><p></p><p>This attack's might surpassed its imagination by a hundredfold!</p><p></p><p>Among the Supernal Beasts, a few had recognized the origin of this sword beam. They were the ones who had previously tried to attack the Nine Provinces but were scared away by Ye Xiao.</p><p></p><p>So they knew that the appearance of this sword beam must mean that man had arrived.</p><p></p><p>Without hesitation, they chose to flee. After all, just a few hours ago, they had witnessed that man's terrifying power. He was truly superhuman, bordering on divine.</p><p></p><p>Even if they failed their mission and might be punished by their superiors or even that legendary young master, it would still be far better than directly facing that human cultivator. At least they had a 50% chance of surviving if they fled now, whereas if they stayed, it was 100% certain death.</p><p></p><p>Seeing those Supernal Beasts fleeing, the others were enraged.</p><p></p><p>"You useless fools! What are they doing?"</p><p></p><p>"We were so close to succeeding, and they chose to run away."</p><p></p><p>"A bunch of cowardly weaklings. That's just a single sword technique the humans have accumulated over a long time, and they're afraid of it?"</p><p></p><p>"Forget it, in the end they're just Supernal Beasts who barely broke through using human divine blood. Let's go capture those two Imperial Realm humans first, then we'll deal with them later."</p><p></p><p>"Attack!"</p><p></p><p>However, in the next moment, another sword beam shot up from below.</p><p></p><p>This one was even faster, stronger, and more formidable than the previous one. It was as if the earlier strike had been hastily and carelessly released, while this one was more relaxed, unleashing even greater power.</p><p></p><p>The moment this sword beam slashed out, five Supernal Beasts on the same horizontal line were killed.</p><p></p><p>At this, all the Supernal Beasts couldn't help but have their pupils contract, their entire bodies breaking out in cold sweat.</p><p></p><p>"Damn it! This isn't some accumulated human technique - this is a direct strike!"</p>

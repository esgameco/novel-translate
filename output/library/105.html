        <h1>Chapter 105</h1>
        <div class="content">
            <p>Here is the full English translation of the Chinese excerpt:</p><p></p><p>This black-scaled snake was very large, over 15 meters long and thicker than the slender waist of a dancing girl.</p><p></p><p>Looking closely, there were faint bumps on its head that resembled small horns.</p><p></p><p>The legend goes that a snake that cultivates for a thousand years can become a python, a python that cultivates for a thousand years can become a flood dragon, and a flood dragon that cultivates for a thousand years can transcend tribulation and become a true dragon.</p><p></p><p>This creature's age was estimated to be just over a thousand years old.</p><p></p><p>If it were on Earth, it would definitely be a top-tier protected animal.</p><p></p><p>"Its cultivation is at the early Xiantian Third Realm, just a hair's breadth away from reaching the Xiantian Fourth Realm. What if we first revive it, then use spiritual energy to help it cross that final threshold? Then..."</p><p></p><p>Saying so, he acted on it.</p><p></p><p>After all, finding a Xiantian Fourth Realm spirit beast is extremely rare, and the armor forged from its skin would surpass that of the Xiantian Third Realm.</p><p></p><p>The Chenxing Technique was activated, a flash of golden light, and the black-scaled snake's body began to emanate a golden glow.</p><p></p><p>It was actually evolving during the revival process.</p><p></p><p>How convenient.</p><p></p><p>What surprised Ye Xiao even more was that as the black-scaled snake was evolving, it shed its previous skin.</p><p></p><p>This meant he would obtain two snake skins - one from the Xiantian Third Realm black-scaled snake, and one from the Xiantian Fourth Realm black-scaled snake.</p><p></p><p>This was a great plan - in the future, when killing spirit beasts, he could first catalyze their evolution, then slay them!</p><p></p><p>No, wait, if he could keep peeling its skin and then use healing techniques to help it recover, he could obtain multiple snake skins! Perfect!</p><p></p><p>The black-scaled snake quickly revived, its consciousness emerging from the haze.</p><p></p><p>"I remember being slain by a human's attack, how am I revived? And my cultivation has even advanced to the Xiantian Fourth Realm! Could it be that I obtained a breakthrough at the brink of death?"</p><p></p><p>The snake-like master spirit beast could speak the human tongue, which was nothing extraordinary.</p><p></p><p>As it was laughing, the black-scaled snake suddenly noticed Ye Xiao standing beside it.</p><p></p><p>An extremely audacious human insect daring to stand by its side.</p><p></p><p>Nine times out of ten, this was a human cultivator sent to guard its corpse.</p><p></p><p>This was a blatant provocation of the dignity of a master spirit beast.</p><p></p><p>In an instant, the black-scaled snake was consumed by rage!</p><p></p><p>"Damned human, I'll—!"</p><p></p><p>Seeing Ye Xiao's direction shift in its eyes, and the tearing pain at its abdomen, the snake's massive head fell into confusion.</p><p></p><p>As it plummeted to the ground with a thud, the intense pain brought it to full awareness.</p><p></p><p>No, no! This person was not the human cultivator guarding it, but the one who had slain it! In that moment, a sense of immense despair filled the black-scaled snake's heart.</p><p></p><p>That sword strike was of unparalleled elegance, something it had never witnessed in its entire existence.</p><p></p><p>The sword techniques of this human cultivator were shockingly powerful! And it had fallen into his hands - what a tragedy!</p><p></p><p>A profound sense of hopeless sorrow welled up within it.</p><p></p><p>To think that it had just advanced to the Xiantian Fourth Realm, only to encounter such a formidable opponent, ultimately being slain by his sword. If Lord Aer were still around, it would not have suffered such a humiliating defeat.</p><p></p><p>The spirit beast's robust life force prevented it from dying instantly, but this only made its suffering more agonizing.</p><p></p><p>For it watched as this human began to peel off its skin.</p><p></p><p>Undoubtedly, the human would use its skin to forge armor, to protect himself against other spirit beasts.</p><p></p><p>What a disgrace!</p><p></p><p>But alas, this was the way of the world - the strong devour the weak.</p><p></p><p>Here is the full English translation of the Chinese excerpt:</p><p></p><p>The Law.</p><p></p><p>I have eaten quite a few humans before, so I've made my money's worth. <div class="contentadv"><script>loadAdv(7,3);</script></div> Humans, wait until the day when the seven stars align, and my king returns. I will then completely subdue all the human tribes in the Jianghai City, turning them into food for the star beasts, devouring them all without leaving a single one! I, the Black Scale Snake, will take the lead and wait for you up in the sky! My consciousness is already starting to blur, but the Black Scale Snake not only is not troubled by death, but instead looks forward to it boldly.</p><p></p><p>But just at this moment, a warm force suddenly enveloped its body and consciousness, gradually awakening its consciousness.</p><p></p><p>Black Scale Snake: "?"</p><p></p><p>Two seconds later, its body was completely repaired.</p><p></p><p>This left the Black Scale Snake completely dumbfounded and at a loss.</p><p></p><p>Could this human have had a change of heart and not want to kill it anymore? As soon as this thought flashed through its mind, the Black Scale Snake's neck suddenly felt pain again, and the leaves in its eyes tilted once more.</p><p></p><p>Its neck had been severed again.</p><p></p><p>Damn it!</p><p></p><p>The Black Scale Snake finally realized that the other party was not having a change of heart to save it, but rather wanted to heal it and then peel its skin again!</p><p></p><p>Ten minutes later: "Human, don't go too far."</p><p></p><p>Twenty minutes later: "Human, I'm not on the same side as you."</p><p></p><p>Thirty minutes later: "@!#$%$#%Y^&!"</p><p></p><p>Forty minutes later: "(╯￣Д￣)╯╘═╛!"</p><p></p><p>Fifty minutes later: "(｀□′)╯┴┴┴—┴╰(｀□′╰)!"</p><p></p><p>Sixty minutes later: "I curse you."</p><p></p><p>Poof!</p><p></p><p>This time, Ye Xiao did not revive the Black Scale Snake again.</p><p></p><p>If he revived it again, the other party might really curse his mother. Although he was an orphan, he was still born of a mother, and he couldn't be cursed for a little bit of profit.</p><p></p><p>Moreover,</p><p></p><p>Ye Xiao looked at the Black Scale Snake skins that had already filled the entire courtyard and revealed a satisfied smile.</p><p></p><p>Except for the first one that the Black Scale Snake had shed, which was a primordial third-grade snake skin, the rest were all primordial fourth-grade snake skins.</p><p></p><p>Their flexibility, extensibility, and the defensive properties of the scales on the snake skins were all top-notch.</p><p></p><p>With his emperor-level forging skills, he would definitely be able to forge some excellent armor.</p><p></p><p>By now, it was already night. Ye Xiao looked at the snake meat on the Black Scale Snake's body, the corners of his mouth slightly curling up.</p><p></p><p>"Huan Liuli, light a fire. We're having a late-night feast tonight, beer and wild meat barbecue."</p><p></p><p>"Understood." Huan Liuli replied indifferently. This day was not only a torment for the Black Scale Snake, but also a torment for her.</p><p></p><p>A primordial fourth-grade Black Scale Snake, yet it couldn't even withstand a single move from Ye Xiao, and was repeatedly peeled by him.</p><p></p><p>If it were a human, Huan Liuli wouldn't have felt anything, but it was a star beast, and that was different.</p><p></p><p>Because she was also a star beast.</p><p></p><p>It's just like how a person wouldn't feel any sympathy for a fish being descaled, but how would a fish feel seeing its own kind being descaled?</p><p></p><p>Huan Liuli strongly suspected that Ye Xiao's repeated peeling of the Black Scale Snake might have a certain purposeful implication.</p><p></p><p>An implication to warn herself to behave.</p><p></p><p>Huan Liuli sneered inwardly.</p><p></p><p>Ye Xiao, if you think this can intimidate me, you're really underestimating me.</p><p></p><p>"Four hundred years from now, I must make you my pet! At that time, I will definitely torment you ruthlessly! Hahaha."</p><p></p><p>Second update, seeking votes.</p><p></p><p>Thank you, reader Night Slayer Hui, for the donation, greatly appreciated.</p><p></p><p>(This chapter ends)</p>

        <h1>Chapter 136</h1>
        <div class="content">
            <p>Here is the full English translation of the Chinese excerpt:</p><p></p><p>Ye Xiao did not intend to use the hide of the Aier King to forge a single set of armor.</p><p></p><p>The hide of the Aier King was extremely tough, but compared to stacking hundreds of black scaled snake skins, it couldn't be said to be that much stronger - that would be exaggerating a bit.</p><p></p><p>While the black scaled snake skin was strong, it could still be easily slashed by the imperial long sword he had forged.</p><p></p><p>Therefore, he should refine the hide of the Aier King and fuse it with the black scaled snake skin.</p><p></p><p>In this way, the fusion of the two would definitely yield benefits far exceeding forging a single set of armor.</p><p></p><p>Without hesitation, Ye Xiao spent a day and a night completing the forging of the armor while he was still on vacation.</p><p></p><p>The appearance remained a black coat with black pants - the head could be severed, the blood could flow, maintaining a cool feeling.</p><p></p><p>After the forging was complete, Ye Xiao used the Tang Sword to try cutting it, and found that this time it was much better - it only left a scratch and did not completely pierce the armor.</p><p></p><p>It seems that the black scaled snake skin was still no match for the horn of the Aier King.</p><p></p><p>This was still considered a secondary product, no matter how much essence was condensed.</p><p></p><p>But now with the hide of the Aier King, Ye Xiao's defensive power had risen significantly.</p><p></p><p>It was still quite good.</p><p></p><p>The next step was much simpler.</p><p></p><p>Ye Xiao refined the star nucleus of the Aier King into a medicinal pill and swallowed it.</p><p></p><p>As the medicinal pill entered his body, the spiritual energy erupted violently like lightning and thunder, restless and uneasy.</p><p></p><p>The spiritual cultivation of the Aier King was about the same as Ye Xiao's, and the powerful energy contained in its star nucleus was self-evident.</p><p></p><p>Although it was not the Aier King's full power, it still possessed a formidable spiritual energy reserve.</p><p></p><p>Fortunately, Ye Xiao now had many cultivation techniques, and with them all running simultaneously, he quickly brought the raging spiritual energy back on track, circulating it through his meridians according to his own methods, significantly boosting his cultivation.</p><p></p><p>"Taking medicinal pills to improve cultivation is indeed much faster.</p><p></p><p>No wonder everyone says that if you want your cultivation to rise quickly, you should go to the Star Battlefield."</p><p></p><p>The Star Battlefield was filled with many star beasts, and by hunting them, one could obtain a lot of star nuclei and battle merits to exchange for medicinal pills.</p><p></p><p>If he could consume more medicinal pills, his cultivation would definitely rise much faster.</p><p></p><p>However, the Star Battlefield was too dangerous, with experts abounding, and even Godly Monarchs might be present.</p><p></p><p>It's better to wait until his cultivation has improved a bit more before considering it.</p><p></p><p>In the Golden Book, the Extreme Healing Art had finally reached the Great Perfection realm, and the three pages recording the three imperial healing arts were now emanating a pure golden glow.</p><p></p><p>This made Ye Xiao even more delighted, as he could now synthesize them!</p><p></p><p>The synthesis of imperial-level arts, he wondered what powerful technique would emerge. However, when he tried to control the divine spirit of the Golden Book to synthesize the techniques, he unexpectedly found that the divine spirit did not respond at all.</p><p></p><p>Ye Xiao: "(。ˇェˇ)!"</p><p></p><p>What's going on? Wasn't the golden glow a sign that the techniques could be synthesized once they were all gathered? Why was the synthesis not successful?</p><p></p><p>Ye Xiao refused to give up, using his own will to click on the divine spirit of the Golden Book several times.</p><p></p><p>Yet the divine spirit remained unresponsive.</p><p></p><p>It wasn't until the fortieth click that the divine spirit of the Golden Book finally seemed to be impatient, displaying eight large characters on the book's surface:</p><p></p><p>Cultivation level too low, insufficient authority.</p><p></p><p>Ye Xiao: "（╬￣皿￣）!"</p><p></p><p>How unreasonable, you could have just said so earlier instead of letting me waste time clicking so many times.</p><p></p><p>However, this also made Ye Xiao somewhat wary.</p><p></p><p>He had already reached the Innate Seventh Rank in cultivation, yet this level was still considered low? Heavens, how powerful must the true experts be? It seems he still needs to stay low-key, as this world is truly terrifying.</p><p></p><p>By the time all of this was done, several days had already passed, and the Seven Star Convergence had finally come to an end.</p><p></p><p>Jianghai City had safely weathered the crisis without a single casualty, perhaps making it the only city in the world to do so.</p><p></p><p>The library had also finally received the notice to resume work.</p><p></p><p>Ye Xiao saw from the news that the star beasts in other cities had also been mostly cleared, and the cities were beginning to return to normal.</p><p></p><p>He didn't really care - while everyone else had suffered heavy losses during the Seven Star Convergence, he not only remained unharmed, but had also gained a great deal.</p><p></p><p>His cultivation had risen to the Innate Seventh Rank, reaching the Godly Monarch realm. He had forged an imperial long sword, strengthened his armor, and even gained an imperial art - the Extreme Healing Art.</p><p></p><p>It could be said that he had reaped a bountiful harvest.</p><p></p><p>Moreover, he had also finished eating all of the Aier King's meat.</p><p></p><p>Grilled mutton skewers, mutton hot pot, boiled mutton, mutton soup, mutton offal soup, salted and peppered mutton ribs, mutton bone soup - he had tried every possible way to cook the meat.</p><p></p><p>In the end, only a small piece of the shin bone was left, which Yuanliu had kept, licking it with sauce every day.</p><p></p><p>Ye Xiao strongly suspected that she had been bitten by a husky, causing her intelligence to severely decline, making her almost as stupid as a husky.</p><p></p><p>However, since the Seven Star Convergence had ended, it would no longer cause any special magnetic field changes, so Ye Xiao no longer needed to constantly accompany her.</p><p></p><p>In the morning when he went to buy breakfast, he bought mostly vegetable buns, as he had eaten too much meat these past few days and needed to have some greens.</p><p></p><p>Here is the full English translation of the Chinese excerpt:</p><p></p><p>Oil.</p><p></p><p>After finishing breakfast, I came to the library, and Ouyang Yunzhong, as usual, opened the morning meeting.</p><p></p><p>"Everyone has been very tense these days, the Seven Stars Pearls, which is a major disaster and impact for us humans. <div class="contentadv"><script>loadAdv(7,3);</script></div>But it is also a test for us humans.</p><p></p><p>It is precisely because of so many tribulations that we humans can constantly improve ourselves and become more prosperous and powerful."</p><p></p><p>The director is indeed a director, having held a high position for decades, and his official tone is so smooth.</p><p></p><p>Never mind what's going on, let's pour some chicken soup first.</p><p></p><p>However, based on Ye Xiao's understanding of the director, usually when the director starts pouring chicken soup, there's likely to be no good news.</p><p></p><p>Sure enough, Ouyang Yunzhong then continued:</p><p></p><p>"Furthermore, the second matter is to convey the instructions issued by the Central State.</p><p></p><p>Since many important libraries in the Nine States have been damaged, some important books from the libraries will be relocated to some undamaged libraries.</p><p></p><p>Our Jianghai City Library will also receive a batch of new techniques.</p><p></p><p>The specific techniques have not yet been determined, but the expansion of the library is definitely required."</p><p></p><p>The crowd immediately started discussing.</p><p></p><p>"Expand again?"</p><p></p><p>"Our library is really too good, it has been expanded twice in such a short time."</p><p></p><p>"Isn't expansion good? With the expansion, there will definitely be more good positions."</p><p></p><p>Many people started to get excited, their eyes gleaming.</p><p></p><p>Ye Xiao was not affected at all, but instead raised his eyebrows slightly.</p><p></p><p>Indeed, expansion will bring more positions, especially management positions, such as section managers and department heads.</p><p></p><p>But this expansion is different from the previous one.</p><p></p><p>The previous expansion was carried out with the support of the local lord's mansion in Jianghai City, which was an internal promotion.</p><p></p><p>The library also recruited local people, mostly new hires.</p><p></p><p>In short, those with a little bit of seniority would be promoted.</p><p></p><p>For example, he was very lucky to have been promoted.</p><p></p><p>But this expansion is obviously due to the severe damage to other libraries in the Nine States, forcing them to relocate a batch of books here.</p><p></p><p>Furthermore, Ye Xiao strongly suspects that the Central State knows he is in Jianghai City, so they want to use him to protect Jianghai City, which is relatively stable, to protect some important libraries and books.</p><p></p><p>For example, many master-level techniques.</p><p></p><p>Or perhaps even imperial arts?</p><p></p><p>Of course, this is just Ye Xiao's speculation.</p><p></p><p>After all, imperial arts cannot be casually placed in the library.</p><p></p><p>But in any case, this library upgrade and expansion will definitely take the strengthening route.</p><p></p><p>Trying to advance through seniority is likely impossible, and some people may even lose their original positions, as they will hire some high-level talents, that is, stronger cultivators.</p><p></p><p>Sure enough, just as the crowd was getting excited, Ouyang Yunzhong cleared his throat and spoke again:</p><p></p><p>"Ahem, it's like this, because after the library expansion, some stronger techniques will be added, so the cultivation requirements for the library staff, including the management positions, will be higher than now.</p><p></p><p>The intention of the Central State is to conduct an assessment of the current library staff, divided into literary and martial arts tests.</p><p></p><p>The literary test, everyone knows, is naturally to test the mastery of library work.</p><p></p><p>The martial arts test is even simpler, testing everyone's cultivation.</p><p></p><p>As long as they pass these two tests, or excel in one of them, they will be retained and continue to serve.</p><p></p><p>But those who fail the exam may be arranged to other work units."</p><p></p><p>At these words, the crowd was like being doused with a bucket of cold water, and there was an uproar.</p><p></p><p>"My God, how can this be?"</p><p></p><p>"Yes, that's right, I originally applied for the library management position because my cultivation was not good enough. But now there's going to be an assessment, and we may have to change positions, how is this different from layoffs?"</p><p></p><p>"I'm done for, I'll definitely be eliminated, my cultivation is only at the Posterior Heaven First Rank, just based on this, I probably won't be able to pass."</p><p></p><p>The crowd was in a state of despair, just like students who were notified of a sudden exam by the teacher.</p><p></p><p>Ouyang Yunzhong spoke up to comfort them:</p><p></p><p>"Don't be discouraged, everyone. I will do my best to ensure that you all can stay. As for those colleagues who really can't stay, I will also try my best to arrange better positions for you through my connections."</p><p></p><p>Regarding these words, the crowd naturally did not believe them.</p><p></p><p>This is an instruction issued by the Central State, and it is different from the previous expansion, which is no longer something she can decide.</p><p></p><p>Four updates, 12,000 words, please recommend votes, subscribe, and vote for monthly tickets.

        <h1>Chapter 139</h1>
        <div class="content">
            <p>Here is the full English translation of the Chinese excerpt:</p><p></p><p>This was the first time Ye Xiao had seen this word.</p><p></p><p>If it was based on his understanding from his previous life, Ye Xiao would not believe in such a thing. </p><p></p><p>It was simply feudal superstition.</p><p></p><p>However, in this world filled with spiritual energy, Ye Xiao had no choice but to believe it.</p><p></p><p>According to the rumors, whether it was humans or spirit beasts, as long as a clan was formed, there would definitely be a mysterious power that secretly protected them.</p><p></p><p>This power would not manifest itself on ordinary days. It would only appear when the race was in difficulty.</p><p></p><p>Moreover, the way it manifested itself was not in a concrete form, but in an extremely special way to help the entire clan.</p><p></p><p>The more prosperous the incense and offerings of a clan, the more powerful the fortune that would appear.</p><p></p><p>And the more the incense and offerings declined, the weaker the fortune would become.</p><p></p><p>The way the human race's fortune manifested itself was that it would help humans create an emperor! A person with the bloodline of an emperor would have their strength greatly enhanced and their cultivation speed would be as fast as lightning.</p><p></p><p>The entire clan would devote all their efforts to cultivating this person.</p><p></p><p>He would become a top-tier existence, and when the human race faced a crisis, he would emerge and resolve the crisis.</p><p></p><p>For example, the Ancestor Dragon of the Great Qin Dynasty unified the Nine Provinces, resolved the chaos in the Nine Provinces, gathered the strong experts of the Nine Provinces, expelled the spirit beasts from the ground, and established the star battlefield in the sky above the Nine Provinces.</p><p></p><p>Before he appeared, although the human race also had emperors, the battles were always fought on the ground. </p><p></p><p>The battles between human warriors and spirit beasts were extremely brutal, with countless casualties.</p><p></p><p>After him, the spirit beasts were blocked in the star battlefield, and the human race was able to make great strides, rapidly reproducing in a relatively stable life.</p><p></p><p>But now, there has been no emperor in the world for decades! An emperor is first discovered, then protected, and then begins to cultivate and rapidly increase his strength to fight against the powerful spirit beasts.</p><p></p><p>At this moment, Ye Xiao suddenly thought of the expansion of Jianghai City.</p><p></p><p>At present, the beast disaster is about to come, and according to the information he obtained from that spirit beast saint, the spirit beasts had already planned in the previous beast disaster.</p><p></p><p>And when the next beast disaster comes, there is a high probability that it will be the strongest of the recent disasters.</p><p></p><p>Doesn't this mean that the human race will face a great disaster? </p><p></p><p>This can also be considered a major crisis for the human race, right?</p><p></p><p>Since it is a major crisis for the human race, there is a very high probability that an "emperor" will appear. So if this is the case, the expansion of Jianghai City may be the Nine Province Alliance trying to expand its influence, gather the warriors, and then notice and select the emperor. After all, the cities being expanded are not just Jianghai City, but many other cities as well.</p><p></p><p>By merging many small cities into a large city, it will be very easy to find that person who has been chosen by fortune and has the bloodline of an emperor.</p><p></p><p>Unfortunately, the book did not provide much detailed description of that kind of person, only that they would be called "Saint Son" or "Saint Daughter"! In addition, they would have extremely outstanding natural talents, and at a very young age, they would have a terrifying growth rate.</p><p></p><p>This speed would be unmatched by ordinary human geniuses, or even top-level human geniuses!</p><p></p><p>Aside from that, there was no more information available. </p><p></p><p>It couldn't be helped, after all, it was just a book from a small bookstore, so the information was not complete.</p><p></p><p>Ye Xiao could only wait until he returned to the library later to carefully search for more information on this.</p><p></p><p>He was a little interested in this.</p><p></p><p>Could this person be himself? But it's not necessarily the case, his cultivation speed is very fast, but a bit too fast.</p><p></p><p>The Saint Son and Saint Daughter are found and then cultivated with a huge amount of resources before they can rise rapidly.</p><p></p><p>But he has become so strong without relying on anyone.</p><p></p><p>That means this emperor could also be someone else.</p><p></p><p>If that's the case, whenever he encounters a young genius with a fast cultivation speed, he should pay attention.</p><p></p><p>Establish a connection in advance.</p><p></p><p>In the evening, after finishing the book and eating a bowl of over-the-bridge rice noodles on the street, Ye Xiao was about to go home and sleep.</p><p></p><p>But at this moment, his phone suddenly rang.</p><p></p><p>The caller ID showed it was Ouyang Yunzhong.</p><p></p><p>"Director Ouyang, what's the matter?"</p><p></p><p>"Ye Xiao, do you have time now?"</p><p></p><p>"No, I'm busy."</p><p></p><p>After a pause, Ye Xiao added another sentence.</p><p></p><p>"Very busy."</p><p></p><p>"I see. That's too bad, I'm hosting a banquet at the Jianghai City Grand Hotel to entertain some important guests, and I need a few helpers. Then I'll have to find someone else."</p><p></p><p>Ye Xiao: "(Sigh)!"</p><p></p><p>"One of them is an old acquaintance of yours, that Master Fajing."</p><p></p><p>"Then I'll go over there. I'll deal with other things later, after all, official business is important."</p><p></p><p>Ye Xiao wasn't particularly interested in eating good food, but since Fajing had come and it was his good friend, of course he wanted to go see him.</p><p></p><p>Soon, he arrived at the Jianghai City Grand Hotel.</p><p></p><p>This was one of the five-star hotels in Jianghai City, and the Hunan and Sichuan cuisine they served was unparalleled! Just take the simple mapo tofu as an example, the mapo tofu at other places...</p><p></p><p>Here is my translation of the Chinese excerpt:</p><p></p><p>Call for tofu with chili peppers.</p><p></p><p>The mapo tofu at this restaurant is truly mapo tofu! There are also minced chili fish head, spicy beef, and stir-fried small chicken. Delicious and flavorful, making one's mouth water.</p><p></p><p>Fajing is a Buddhist monk, he doesn't eat spicy or meat. Later he must persuade the manager to add more meat dishes and spicy dishes. </p><p></p><p>Anyway, Fajing only eats plain white rice.</p><p></p><p>Just as Yexiao arrived at the Jianghai City Grand Hotel, Manager Ouyang was already waiting at the entrance.</p><p></p><p>Besides her, there were a few other colleagues from the library.</p><p></p><p>The group came together, it seems this time, aside from Elder Monk Fajing, there may be other distinguished guests arriving.</p><p></p><p>Yexiao came up, greeted them, then stood aside with the colleagues.</p><p></p><p>Soon, a few small cars stopped at the entrance of the Jianghai City Grand Hotel.</p><p></p><p>Seeing the small cars arrive, Manager Ouyang immediately went to greet them, the other colleagues also followed, and of course Yexiao did not fall behind.</p><p></p><p>As he walked up, he noticed something strange about these small cars - they were all protected by extremely powerful defensive formations!</p><p></p><p>This was not too unusual, as even ordinary cars sometimes have defensive formations set up to protect important passengers.</p><p></p><p>What truly struck Yexiao as strange was that the occupants of these cars were all from the Shaolin Martial Arts Academy, and they were all highly skilled masters! Their cultivation was basically all at the Grandmaster level, including a few Great Grandmasters, as well as Fajing.</p><p></p><p>Among them, there was even one at the Quasi-Divine Realm!</p><p></p><p>Just one step away from the Divine Realm, ready to break through at any moment!</p><p></p><p>What a luxurious lineup! </p><p></p><p>With such a luxurious lineup, why would they still need to set up defensive formations?</p><p></p><p>Strange, absolutely strange.</p><p></p><p>This matter is not simple at all.</p><p></p><p>Yexiao activated his Taixuan Tiangong and scanned the people and the interior of the cars.</p><p></p><p>He discovered that these Shaolin Martial Arts Academy experts all had storage rings.</p><p></p><p>Could it be that this time, the books being distributed to the Jianghai City Library are from the Luzhou Library and the Shaolin Martial Arts Library? Yexiao's eyes lit up, if that's the case, that would truly be good news.</p><p></p><p>The Shaolin Martial Arts Library has the most techniques.</p><p></p><p>He had previously learned that in the past, many Shaolin experts had gone to the Star Battlefield, slaying Star Beasts and obtaining a large number of Star Cores, thereby acquiring a vast number of techniques.</p><p></p><p>They were even praised as "All martial arts under the heavens originate from Shaolin!"</p><p></p><p>It seems that the storage rings these people are carrying are most likely filled with such treasures.</p><p></p><p>In that case, he will probably have the good fortune to peruse many more techniques.</p><p></p><p>However, just at this moment, Yexiao's Taixuan Tiangong suddenly detected a strange iron box in the middle car, the one carrying the Quasi-Divine Realm expert.</p><p></p><p>This iron box was protected by an imperial formation even more powerful than the defensive formations on the cars!</p><p></p><p>An imperial formation! Yexiao's eyes flickered.</p><p></p><p>Whatever is sealed inside this box protected by an imperial formation must be no ordinary thing.</p><p></p><p>Because even with the suppression of the imperial formation, Yexiao could still faintly sense a bloodthirsty aura emanating from it!</p><p></p><p>It's a Star Beast! A extremely ferocious Star Beast is sealed within.</p><p></p><p>With the expansion of Jianghai City imminent, for Shaolin to now send techniques, it is obviously not possible for them to also send a disaster.</p><p></p><p>The only explanation is that this Star Beast is meant to replace Aier, to help Jianghai City increase its absorption of spiritual energy!</p><p></p><p>Only in this way would Shaolin send such a luxurious entourage, with the cars protected by defensive formations.</p><p></p><p>In just a flash, Yexiao had already deduced the purpose of Shaolin's visit.</p><p></p><p>However, it is mostly good news.</p><p></p><p>Of course, Yexiao is not a fool.</p><p></p><p>He also has a bit of an inkling.</p><p></p><p>Most likely it is because of the powerful performance he displayed in his battle against Aier, which has given confidence to the Central State and the Nine States.</p><p></p><p>Therefore, the Jingzhou, Luzhou, and Central State have decided to expand Jianghai City.</p><p></p><p>The reason is that they have a Divine Realm expert like himself in Jianghai City! This is also good, as he can take this opportunity to read more books, refine more techniques, and improve his own cultivation!</p><p></p><p>Manager Ouyang quickly walked up and engaged in official courtesies with the other party.</p><p></p><p>Elder Monk Fajing was not the main figure, that Quasi-Divine Realm expert was the leader of the Shaolin group, so Manager Ouyang mainly spoke with him.</p><p></p><p>Meanwhile, Fajing took the opportunity to come to Yexiao's side and greet him.</p><p></p><p>"Amitabha, Benefactor Yexiao. We meet again. As I said before, you are destined to have a karmic connection with me."</p>

        <h1>Chapter 171</h1>
        <div class="content">
            <p>Here is the full English translation of the Chinese excerpt:</p><p></p><p>Building a breeding farm must be done in a suitable location - one that is convenient for harvesting, can ensure no one will discover it, and can guarantee the star beasts won't escape.</p><p></p><p>Hmm, I've got the perfect place.</p><p></p><p>Ye Xiao thought of a wonderful location.</p><p></p><p>That would be the sealing site of Noel Fiss.</p><p></p><p>First, the sealing site of Noel Fiss is where I go to and from work every day, so I can conveniently harvest there after getting off work.</p><p></p><p>Secondly, the sealing site of Noel Fiss has the defensive imperial formation I set up, which can perfectly defend against these star beasts escaping.</p><p></p><p>Although these star beasts are extremely powerful, having reached the Divine Ancestor realm, and there are quite a few of them, Ye Xiao can simply purchase some spirit stone materials to enhance the formation's strength, thereby ensuring the safety of the breeding farm.</p><p></p><p>Furthermore, it's very close to me, so if this group wants to escape, I can quickly discover and deal with them.</p><p></p><p>The last point is the secrecy.</p><p></p><p>Who would ever think that a group of powerful Divine Ancestor realm star beasts are being kept in the underground bar in front of the library? And now that I've learned the earth traversal technique, I don't need to dig a hole to enter the underground seal like before.</p><p></p><p>Finally, there's an additional benefit.</p><p></p><p>Underneath that sealing formation is actually a spirit gathering formation!</p><p></p><p>After putting them down there, I can use them to increase the speed at which the spirit gathering formation absorbs spiritual energy. This indirectly enhances the spiritual energy power of Jianghai City.</p><p></p><p>With my many cultivation techniques that can produce powerful suction, I'll benefit the most from this.</p><p></p><p>A truly perfect plan! Ye Xiao looked up at the sky, which was now dusk. The library should have already closed for the day.</p><p></p><p>He directly activated the earth traversal technique and headed towards the underground of the library.</p><p></p><p>Underneath the library, Noel Fiss slowly opened his eyes, and the corners of his giant octopus mouth slightly curled upwards.</p><p></p><p>After days of cultivation, he had completely recovered from the two tentacles that Ye Xiao had severed, and the lost cultivation had also been replenished.</p><p></p><p>Next, he would continue to cultivate diligently, striving to break through to an even more powerful realm as soon as possible.</p><p></p><p>That way, this split body would eventually have a chance to break through the sealing formation.</p><p></p><p>When that time comes, he would find a way to go to Shaolin, locate his main body, and then merge with it to fully restore his Divine Ancestor realm cultivation.  At that time, he would definitely come back and completely destroy this Jianghai City.</p><p></p><p>And that Ye Xiao, he must dismember him, grill him, coat him in breadcrumbs, deep fry him, and serve him with onions as a teppanyaki dish. </p><p></p><p>He won't kill him, but preserve his life over and over again. Since Ye Xiao knows healing techniques, let him heal himself, then let him watch as his arms are made into skewers.</p><p></p><p>How cruel!</p><p></p><p>Thinking about this, Noel Fiss couldn't help but burst out laughing uncontrollably.</p><p></p><p>"Hahaha...haha...damn it!"</p><p></p><p>But just as he had laughed for a bit, Ye Xiao's figure suddenly barged in.</p><p></p><p>Noel Fiss was immediately startled, and his giant octopus body tightly pressed against the wall, maintaining a certain distance from the just-arrived Ye Xiao.</p><p></p><p>"Big brother, isn't this a bit too much? I just finished recovering, and you've come again. Are you even human?"</p><p></p><p>Ye Xiao glanced at him and replied indifferently, "I'm not here this time to cut off your tentacles."</p><p></p><p>Noel Fiss furrowed his brow. </p><p></p><p>This guy couldn't be joking with him, right? If he's not here to cut his tentacles, then why did he specifically come to see him? It can't be that he's here for a romantic relationship, can it?</p><p></p><p>He had heard that in the Eastern Yingzhou of the Nine Provinces, there were some strange human beings, and their females would capture some of their own kind to play strange games. </p><p></p><p>But he had never heard of anyone in the Nine Provinces having such a fetish, let alone a man.</p><p></p><p>Just as Noel Fiss was puzzled, Ye Xiao took out Jifeng, Dixian Weng, Xuantuo Python, and several other Divine Ancestor realm star beasts from his storage space.</p><p></p><p>In that instant, Noel Fiss was completely dumbfounded.</p><p></p><p>Noel Fiss: "[]!"</p><p></p><p>Was he dreaming? </p><p></p><p>This Ye Xiao actually killed so many Divine Ancestor realm star beasts? What the hell? Was his strength that terrifying? And judging from his current actions, it seems he wants to revive them!</p><p></p><p>What is he trying to do? Does he want to raise Divine Ancestor realm star beasts as livestock? No way! </p><p></p><p>Sure enough, the next moment, Ye Xiao revived all the Divine Ancestor realm star beasts.</p><p></p><p>Noel Fiss completely collapsed.</p><p></p><p>Damn it, this Ye Xiao is too strong.</p><p></p><p>His 1,500-year-old hidden plan might be difficult to resist.</p><p></p><p>Because the cultivation of star beasts is often tied to their age, after 1,500 years, his split body could at most only cultivate to the peak of the Innate Eighth Rank, and he couldn't even say he could cultivate to the Innate Ninth Rank.</p><p></p><p>With such cultivation, how could he break through the formation and escape? No, he must remain calm.</p><p></p><p>Here is the full English translation of the Chinese excerpt:</p><p></p><p>It's no big deal to endure a few more days of humiliation and hardship.</p><p></p><p>Yes, just endure a few more days of humiliation and hardship! Even if it's another five hundred years, no, a thousand years, two thousand five hundred years!</p><p></p><p>After two thousand five hundred years, he must break through his cultivation and break out of this formation to escape the clutches of this demon.</p><p></p><p>The other spirit beasts had just been revived and were still a bit confused.</p><p></p><p>"Strange, weren't we already dead? How come we've revived again?"</p><p></p><p>But when they saw Ye Xiao, their expressions immediately changed to one of terror.</p><p></p><p>"Fuck! How is this plague doctor here?"</p><p></p><p>With a shrill scream, all the spirit beasts quickly fled towards the outside, but were bounced back after hitting the formation.</p><p></p><p>The spirit beasts violently collided with the formation, but no matter how hard they hit, they couldn't break free.</p><p></p><p>Ye Xiao spoke indifferently:</p><p></p><p>"Want to keep colliding? If you do, I'll eat you all."</p><p></p><p>With just one sentence, all the spirit beasts immediately stopped moving and pressed themselves against the formation wall, trembling in fear as they looked at Ye Xiao.</p><p></p><p>Seeing the spirit beasts behaving obediently, Ye Xiao felt quite relieved.</p><p></p><p>"Well, from now on, this will be your home.</p><p></p><p>I'll come here every day to harvest a bit of your spirit beast flesh to replenish my qi and blood. But I won't take your lives. I hope you can cooperate and not give me too much trouble, because I really dislike dealing with hassles."</p><p></p><p>After saying that, Ye Xiao turned and left.</p><p></p><p>The spirit beasts finally let out a sigh of relief.</p><p></p><p>But soon, they became enraged.</p><p></p><p>"What kind of words are these?"</p><p></p><p>"Yeah, what does he mean by 'not taking our lives'? Does he think what he's doing is not excessive?"</p><p></p><p>"Damn human, I'll kill him one day!"</p><p></p><p>At this time, Nuoerfei slowly spoke up:</p><p></p><p>"This Venerable One has something to say. Who among you can defeat him now? Or, can all of us together defeat him?"</p><p></p><p>After these words were spoken, all the spirit beasts immediately had a dumbfounded expression, and the entire space fell into a deathly silence.</p><p></p><p>Not long after, Ji Feng couldn't help but coldly laugh, "Senior Nuoerfei, how dare you speak? If it wasn't for you scheming against me in the past, would we have been so easily captured by him?"</p><p></p><p>Nuoerfei also coldly snorted, "You chicken-brained one, how dare you speak to This Venerable One? This Venerable One had repeatedly warned you not to provoke him, but you insisted that your cultivation was profound and you were not afraid to fight him alone. The result was you being easily defeated by him with just one move.</p><p></p><p>This Venerable One is even embarrassed to mention this."</p><p></p><p>"Youâ€”!"</p><p></p><p>Ji Feng was so angry that he almost vomited blood, ready to attack, when the Immortal Celestial Ginseng Venerable suddenly spoke up:</p><p></p><p>"Enough, enough, we are all prisoners now, what is there to argue about? We should instead think about how to escape from here.</p><p></p><p>Senior Nuoerfei, you are the one with the strongest cultivation and the widest knowledge among us.</p><p></p><p>In your opinion, how long will it take for us to escape? And how can we escape?"</p><p></p><p>Nuoerfei cleared his throat.</p><p></p><p>"Regarding this matter, This Venerable One has already carefully considered it.</p><p></p><p>Forceful assault will definitely not work! Schemes and deception are also impossible!</p><p></p><p>We are completely no match for him in terms of cultivation, so we can only submit, endure the humiliation, and use time to improve our cultivation.</p><p></p><p>Implement a sustainable development strategy, resolutely obey the leadership of This Venerable One, and resolutely implement the policy of the spirit beast clan becoming stronger with age."</p><p></p><p>"Then how long will this time be?"</p><p></p><p>"Two thousand five hundred years!"</p><p></p><p>After a pause, he added an "at least".</p><p></p><p>"Such a long time?"</p><p></p><p>The spirit beasts couldn't help but exclaim in shock, their faces full of astonishment.</p><p></p><p>Nuoerfei looked grave and solemn as he said, "This is the most basic, in fact, two thousand five hundred years is already considered a short time.</p><p></p><p>You know, our spirit beasts' cultivation is linked to time.</p><p></p><p>It will take about two thousand five hundred years for us to break through and reach the Innate Ninth Grade cultivation.</p><p></p><p>Of course, we have another chance, and that is the Beast Calamity in four years!</p><p></p><p>If a powerful spirit beast attacks us during the Beast Calamity in four years and happens to discover our seal, there is a chance they can rescue us.</p><p></p><p>Before that, the only thing we can do is to please that human, and absolutely cannot let him develop the intention to kill us.</p><p></p><p>Of course, I don't care, I'm a divided body, as long as my main body doesn't die.</p><p></p><p>But you are different, you are all main bodies, if you die, you won't be able to revive."</p><p></p><p>The spirit beasts' eyes lit up.</p><p></p><p>That's right, the Beast Calamity is about to arrive.</p><p></p><p>When the Beast Calamity comes, they will also have a chance to escape.</p><p></p><p>"Okay! If that's the case, then we'll listen to Senior Nuoerfei and just try to please this human. It's only four years, we've already been sealed for over fifty years, we can wait a little longer."</p>

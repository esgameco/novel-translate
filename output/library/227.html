        <h1>Chapter 227</h1>
        <div class="content">
            <p>Here is the full English translation of the Chinese excerpt:</p><p></p><p>Ye Xiao suddenly withdrew his hand, catching the old man off guard.</p><p></p><p>In that instant, the momentum had completely shifted to Ye Xiao.</p><p></p><p>"Not good!" </p><p></p><p>The old man's expression changed drastically.</p><p></p><p>The two had only been testing each other. If they truly fought and injured one another, it would be impossible to stop.</p><p></p><p>He knew better than anyone the consequences of a clash between two Deity Sect experts.</p><p></p><p>However, to his surprise, when his aura surged towards Ye Xiao, Ye Xiao's body remained unmoved!</p><p></p><p>In that moment, the old man's pupils shrank, looking at Ye Xiao with disbelief.</p><p></p><p>How was this possible? </p><p></p><p>They were both Deity Sect experts, evenly matched in strength. Even if Ye Xiao had withdrawn his aura, there was no way he could have remained completely unaffected.</p><p></p><p>Yet that was exactly what had happened - Ye Xiao was completely unharmed.</p><p></p><p>He had not inflicted the slightest injury.</p><p></p><p>This was terrifying! </p><p></p><p>Just how powerful was Ye Xiao's strength to achieve such an incredible feat?</p><p></p><p>What shocked the old man even more was Ye Xiao's age. He could not have been more than twenty-one years old.</p><p></p><p>As a Pupil Art Deity Sect expert, the old man could clearly see through Ye Xiao's true age.</p><p></p><p>Yet at this young age, how could he possess such formidable power? </p><p></p><p>Could it be that he had some extraordinary master who had imparted all their lifetime of cultivation to him?</p><p></p><p>Just then, the standard closing music of the Zhongzhou Martial Arts Library sounded.</p><p></p><p>Ye Xiao put away his books and said indifferently, "The library is closing, goodbye."</p><p></p><p>Leaving those calm words behind, Ye Xiao turned and left, leaving the old man stunned and unable to recover for a long time.</p><p></p><p>"When has the Nine States ever produced a genius like this? Reaching the Innate Ninth Grade Deity Sect at such a young age? Even across the entire world, I've never heard of anyone achieving this level!</p><p></p><p>This youth can truly be considered the number one talent in the world!</p><p></p><p>With the beast calamity approaching, if he can advance even further, it will be a great blessing for the Nine States!"</p><p></p><p>As for Ye Xiao, he had already guessed the old man's identity.</p><p></p><p>An Innate Ninth Grade Deity Sect expert, from the Zhongzhou region, and a Pupil Art cultivator. </p><p></p><p>It could only be the 14th ranked expert on the World Dragon Ranking, the Ghost Fire Spiritual Pupil, Beitang Ce!</p><p></p><p>He was one of the seventeen top experts in the Nine States, ranking within the top ten.</p><p></p><p>As a powerful Pupil Art cultivator capable of noticing Ye Xiao's extraordinary nature, Ye Xiao was not surprised.</p><p></p><p>He was strong, but he was still human, not a god. His current cultivation was only at the Innate Ninth Grade, it did not mean Beitang Ce could not detect his uniqueness.</p><p></p><p>But just because Beitang Ce could see his uniqueness, it did not mean he was Ye Xiao's match. </p><p></p><p>If they truly fought, Ye Xiao was confident he could easily defeat Beitang Ce.</p><p></p><p>Although he had not yet learned the Emperor Art level Pupil Arts, Pupil Arts were not the strongest attack method in this world. </p><p></p><p>With his martial and spiritual cultivations, his physical and soul dual cultivation, his defenses alone would be beyond Beitang Ce's ability to rival, let alone in actual combat.</p><p></p><p>Ye Xiao was not worried about Beitang Ce exposing his identity. </p><p></p><p>As one of the top ranked experts in the world, Beitang Ce would not go around boasting about his identity like a busybody.</p><p></p><p>With his Soul Refining Art, reaching the King Realm was only a matter of time. The powerful experts on the land that could pose a threat to him were already countable on one's fingers.</p><p></p><p>Ye Xiao's initial purpose of not exposing himself was for his own safety, to avoid drawing too much attention. </p><p></p><p>Now, it was simply because he did not want to distance himself from his friends. A life of being unrivaled would be dull and monotonous.</p><p></p><p>Wherever he went, having everyone revere him like obedient dogs and placing him on a pedestal was not the life Ye Xiao wanted.</p><p></p><p>Normalcy was the true path.</p><p></p><p>As for experts like Beitang Ce knowing his identity, it was of no consequence. </p><p></p><p>They were both supreme experts, their interactions would not involve fawning or flattery.</p><p></p><p>In fact, it would be good if he could befriend Beitang Ce.</p><p></p><p>Ye Xiao currently lacked information regarding the King Realm, Emperor Realm, and the Star Battlefield. </p><p></p><p>He needed to find a super expert who could explain these higher realms to him.</p><p></p><p>However, as Ye Xiao had just left the library and was walking on the street, he suddenly sensed a strange force targeting him.</p><p></p><p>An Innate Ninth Grade Deity Sect expert! And a Spiritual Beast at that! Their spiritual power was formidable!</p><p></p><p>Ye Xiao could tell they had locked onto him, clearly confident in their strength and not caring if there were any super experts in Zhongzhou.</p><p></p><p>Here is my translation of the Chinese excerpt:</p><p></p><p>In the sky above the Central Plains, a figure hovered in midair, staring intently at Ye Xiao with a bloodthirsty gaze.</p><p></p><p>"I've found you, human!" </p><p></p><p>After licking his lips, he suddenly dove towards Ye Xiao, intent on snatching him away in broad daylight - a simple, brutal act, treating Ye Xiao as nothing.</p><p></p><p>But Ye Xiao remained calm. As his opponent approached, he activated his divine will technique, shifting his body slightly to effortlessly evade the creature's claws.</p><p></p><p>A look of astonishment crossed the creature's face, but before he could react, Ye Xiao had already grabbed his leg and, using the full power of his divine will, instantly transported them both to a mountain forest outside the city.</p><p></p><p>"So fast!" the creature exclaimed, his pupils constricting. But he had no time to process what was happening before Ye Xiao flung him away.</p><p></p><p>Boom! With a tremendous explosion, the creature was sent hurtling through the mountainside, punching a large hole and creating a crater over 100 meters wide in the rock behind it. But for a powerful Saint Emperor like him, this was nothing.</p><p></p><p>Boom! Another thunderous impact as he spread his aura to level the crater, then took to the air once more. Wiping a trickle of blood from the corner of his mouth, he sneered, "Impressive! I never imagined you would be a Saint Emperor at the Ninth Origin Realm. This trip of mine has truly been a windfall."</p><p></p><p>Ye Xiao remained silent. He had already guessed this would happen after the city defense squad told him the girl they had captured had gone missing. Only three people knew about the star beast cultivating the tiger beast - Ye Xiao, Yang Qian, and that girl. With the city's tiger beasts now being rounded up, the creature must have come to retaliate.</p><p></p><p>The girl had been unlucky, encountering the powerful Saint Emperor before Ye Xiao. She was likely already dead. Seeing no need for further discussion, Ye Xiao prepared to eliminate this opponent directly.</p><p></p><p>Though a Ninth Origin Realm Saint Emperor like this creature, he was still weaker than Noel Faust or Sameul. Ye Xiao, having just recently reached the Ninth Origin Realm himself, was already capable of contending with veteran Saint Emperors. With the powerful imperial arts he cultivated daily, along with consuming honey and Saint Emperor star beast meat to rapidly increase his strength, Ye Xiao now far surpassed his level from just ten days ago. Facing this opponent, who was slightly inferior even to Sameul, would be no more challenging than an elite soldier toying with a newborn child.</p><p></p><p>The creature, sensing Ye Xiao's indifferent attitude and disregard, burned with indignant fury. "Hmph! Don't get too cocky. The final outcome is still uncertain."</p><p></p><p>Unleashing his full speed, the creature's movements suddenly became as swift as Ye Xiao's divine will technique. But Ye Xiao remained perfectly calm, allowing his opponent to approach.</p><p></p><p>"You're dead!" the creature sneered, his claws glowing with a sinister green light as he slashed at Ye Xiao's throat.</p><p></p><p>Sizzle! The creature's eyes widened in disbelief as his claws merely sparked against Ye Xiao's neck without even breaking the skin. His fearsome Yin Demon Claws, renowned for their ruthless lethality, had failed to so much as scratch Ye Xiao.</p><p></p><p>What was going on? How could Ye Xiao's defenses be this formidable, even surpassing a Ninth Origin Realm Mysterious Tortoise Saint Emperor? Before the creature could comprehend this, Ye Xiao's fist had already slammed into his chest.</p><p></p><p>Boom! The Great Annihilation Fist unleashed its earth-shaking power, caving in the creature's chest and instantly stopping his heart, as if striking the very core of his being.</p>

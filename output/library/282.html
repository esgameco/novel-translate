        <h1>Chapter 282</h1>
        <div class="content">
            <p>Here is the full English translation of the Chinese excerpt:</p><p></p><p>Tiger Shenzhen's face was filled with deep pain and distress.</p><p></p><p>"I misjudged you all. I didn't expect your will to be so weak! Just being tormented a little by a mere human, and you've already betrayed your own self-respect.</p><p></p><p>It was in vain that I the god specially came to try and save you. Alas, you, you..."</p><p></p><p>He sighed in exasperation.</p><p></p><p>Feng Long and the other beast spirits' eyes all turned red.</p><p></p><p>"Tiger God, we were wrong, we truly know we were wrong."</p><p></p><p>"Actually, if he had just been torturing us, we wouldn't have been so weak-willed. At most, we would have endured being abused hundreds or even tens of thousands of times! But but, he...he...he also used precious spiritual treasures to tempt us. </p><p></p><p>What he gave was simply too much. That's why we couldn't resist."</p><p></p><p>Tiger Shenzhen's heart was bleeding.</p><p></p><p>These fools, instead of falling to the enemy's blades, they fell to the enemy's sugar-coated cannons.</p><p></p><p>How shameful! In vain did Tiger Shenzhen, who had always prided himself as a mighty general under the Forest God, train such cowardly subordinates whose will was as weak as theirs!</p><p></p><p>Ye Xiao spoke up:</p><p></p><p>"Alright, don't be so distressed! From today onwards, you are one of them as well."</p><p></p><p>Tiger Shenzhen stared fixatedly at Ye Xiao, then suddenly burst into loud laughter.</p><p></p><p>"Hahaha..."</p><p></p><p>After laughing for a while, he finally spoke:</p><p></p><p>"Human, don't be too arrogant! Do you think you can tame them, and therefore tame me as well? Even if this god is tortured to death by you, tortured hundreds or even tens of thousands of times, I will absolutely never become your livestock!</p><p></p><p>I have cultivated for thousands of years, and have never yielded to anyone.</p><p></p><p>You can kill me. But you can never trample on my dignity."</p><p></p><p>Ye Xiao didn't say much, he just took out a few Bloodlotus from his storage ring.</p><p></p><p>This rare and precious treasure, among all spiritual treasures, is an exceptional top-tier item. </p><p></p><p>Although it's not as good as the Myriad Purple Thousand Red Leaves, it is still an ultra-rare spiritual treasure that holds great allure for a beast spirit at the god-level like Tiger Shenzhen.</p><p></p><p>Of course, Ye Xiao didn't intend to eat it himself. For humans, the effects of consuming spiritual herbs are not that great, they need to be refined into pills.</p><p></p><p>But it's still not as good as eating beast spirit flesh.</p><p></p><p>Because in addition to the boundless spiritual energy contained in beast spirit flesh, there is also something else - the rich blood qi! The nutritional value of plants can never be compared to that of animals.</p><p></p><p>This is why Ye Xiao wanted to use spiritual herbs to raise the beast spirits, and then deprive them of their flesh.</p><p></p><p>Sure enough, the moment Tiger Shenzhen saw the Bloodlotus Ye Xiao took out, his eyes couldn't help but flicker slightly.</p><p></p><p>But he still sneered and said:</p><p></p><p>"Don't delude yourself, even if what you have today is extremely good, this god will absolutely never become your livestock."</p><p></p><p>"You can eat these every day! Not just once, but every single day!"</p><p></p><p>Tiger Shenzhen was silent for a second, but in the end he still sneered:</p><p></p><p>"Do you think I would care about these things? I am a noble beast spirit. I am a god-level existence! No matter what you use to tempt me, I will absolutely never become your livestock! Stop deluding yourself, if you want to kill me then kill me, if you want to flay me then flay me, what's the need for so many words?"</p><p></p><p>Feng Long and the other beast spirits couldn't help but clench their fists, deeply moved.</p><p></p><p>"As expected of the mighty Tiger God!"</p><p>"I knew the Tiger God would never submit."</p><p>"Wuwuwu, Tiger God, even though you've become a prisoner, you are still our god in our hearts!"</p><p></p><p>Ye Xiao could see that Tiger Shenzhen's gaze was filled with unwavering determination. He was not like the other beast spirits, his inner heart was truly unyielding.</p><p></p><p>Using torture methods would definitely not be able to tame him.</p><p></p><p>He sighed softly, just about to praise Tiger Shenzhen, when suddenly he sensed Tiger Shenzhen's spiritual energy transmitting to his mind.</p><p></p><p>"Was everything you just said true?"</p><p></p><p>Ye Xiao was startled, looking at Tiger Shenzhen, his expression was still firmly resolute, still showing no sign of any intention to submit.</p><p></p><p>But...why did he secretly communicate with him using spiritual energy? Since Tiger Shenzhen and he were at such high cultivations, the other beast spirits definitely couldn't detect their spiritual communication.</p><p></p><p>Immediately, Ye Xiao communicated back through spiritual energy.</p><p></p><p>"Of course it's true."</p><p></p><p>"There are really this many spiritual treasures every day?"</p><p></p><p>"That's right."</p><p></p><p>"You won't deceive me, right?"</p><p></p><p>"Of course not. What's the point in me deceiving you? If you agree this time and I deceive you, you won't agree next time. I might as well just directly cut off your legs and then heal you with a healing art, it's the same thing."</p><p></p><p>"Okay! If that's the case, this god is willing."</p><p></p><p>"Willing to what?"</p><p></p><p>"To...to become...your livestock!"</p><p></p><p>Ye Xiao: "(_..)!"</p><p></p><p>This guy is simply not playing by the rules at all! On the surface he's so resistant, but underneath he's using spiritual communication to agree to become livestock.</p><p></p><p>Seeing the earnest expression on his face right now, if he hadn't initiated the mental communication himself, even Ye Xiao would have been fooled into thinking he was truly...</p><p></p><p>Here is the full English translation of the Chinese excerpt:</p><p></p><p>Unwavering, unwilling to be livestock.</p><p></p><p>This guy's acting skills are simply too high, those award-winning movie stars are nothing compared to him.</p><p></p><p>"But I have one request." At this moment, the spiritual power of Zhen Xinghu was transmitted again.</p><p></p><p>"Go on."</p><p></p><p>"I can be your livestock, but you have to leave me a little face. In front of them. I absolutely will not agree to be your livestock, you can just take the meat off my body, but I will not submit to you verbally."</p><p></p><p>Ye Xiao: "(_..)!"</p><p></p><p>It turns out to be a stubborn tsundere! No wonder it's a tiger, the cat-like things, they're all stubborn tsunderes.</p><p></p><p>"Okay, this request is not too unreasonable. I'll agree to it."</p><p></p><p>"But the heavenly treasures you give me cannot be less."</p><p></p><p>"Deal."</p><p></p><p>After the spiritual communication was over, Ye Xiao spoke directly again:</p><p></p><p>"Since you're so shameless! Don't blame me then."</p><p></p><p>With that, he raised his hand and a blade of light directly slashed off one of Zhen Xinghu's arms.</p><p></p><p>"Tigerling Lord!"</p><p></p><p>The other beasts were deeply saddened.</p><p></p><p>Zhen Xinghu roared angrily, "Why are you crying? Don't cry. In front of the humans. Don't embarrass me. If anyone cries, I'll chop them up first."</p><p></p><p>The others immediately held their breath, but they were all gritting their teeth, clenching their fists, and looking at Zhen Xinghu with reddened eyes.</p><p></p><p>Zhen Xinghu nodded in satisfaction, then looked at Ye Xiao with a stubborn gaze and released another spiritual power.</p><p></p><p>"Cut off another arm, my Lord! I want double the heavenly treasures!"</p><p></p><p>Ye Xiao: "(_..)!"</p><p></p><p>In the face of such a rude request, he could only comply.</p><p></p><p>Afterwards, he slashed off another arm of Zhen Xinghu.</p><p></p><p>After collecting the two arms of Zhen Xinghu in his storage ring, Ye Xiao threw down about ten Bloodletting Roses and then turned to leave.</p><p></p><p>"Although your temper is a bit stubborn. But I still need you, these Bloodletting Roses, take them to replenish your body, don't die so quickly! I will come to take your flesh and blood again in the future."</p><p></p><p>Ye Xiao turned and left, and the other beasts rushed forward to support Zhen Xinghu.</p><p></p><p>"Tigerling Lord, you have been wronged!"</p><p></p><p>"Tigerling Lord, it's all our fault. If it weren't for us, you wouldn't have ended up in this situation. You should kill us!"</p><p></p><p>"That's right! Tigerling Lord, eat us and use us to enhance your strength, break through this seal."</p><p></p><p>Zhen Xinghu snorted coldly.</p><p></p><p>"What do you think I, Zhen Xinghu, am? I, Zhen Xinghu, value righteousness the most in my life. It was I who voluntarily came to rescue you. Now that I have suffered this great misfortune, it is because of my own lack of skill and insufficient strength. How can I blame you? Would that not make me a despicable and shameless person?"</p><p></p><p>After a pause, he spoke again:</p><p></p><p>"It's just that he cut off my two arms. He cut them off today, and they will grow back tomorrow. But he wants me, Zhen Xinghu, to submit, that's impossible!"</p><p></p><p>All the beasts were moved.</p><p></p><p>"Tigerling Lord! You are forever the god in our hearts."</p><p></p><p>"Tigerling Lord! I will always be your subordinate, never leaving or betraying you in this life!"</p><p></p><p>"Tigerling Lord, your righteousness, please accept my bow!"</p><p></p><p>Even Noel Fis and the others couldn't help but nod and praise:</p><p></p><p>"No wonder you are able to become a divine beast, Zhen Xinghu! Such a state of mind is truly unmatched."</p><p></p><p>"Tigerling Lord, you are truly the most upright beast I have ever seen in my life."</p><p></p><p>Susanne quickly brought over the Bloodletting Roses that Ye Xiao had thrown down.</p><p></p><p>"Tigerling Lord, quickly eat all these heavenly treasures. As long as you eat them, you will recover quickly. With so many heavenly treasures, not only can they restore your cultivation, but they can also greatly enhance your cultivation."</p><p></p><p>Zhen Xinghu snorted coldly.</p><p></p><p>"How can I eat the food that he has obtained through underhanded means? Throw this stuff away!"</p><p></p><p>Susanne's eyes were red.</p><p></p><p>"Tigerling Lord, I know you have a strong sense of justice and don't want to be a slave, but now we are all prisoners. We have no choice but to endure and be patient.</p><p></p><p>But as long as the green mountains remain, we need not fear the lack of firewood. As long as we persist, sooner or later we will overthrow the rule of the human race.</p><p></p><p>But before that, you must take good care of your body. Your physical condition is the most important."</p><p></p><p>The other beasts also persuaded:</p><p></p><p>"That's right, Tigerling Lord, your body is the most important."</p><p></p><p>Noel Fis also spoke up to persuade:</p><p></p><p>"Zhen Xinghu, don't be so stubborn anymore. Here, it will be meaningless. Although your spirit is indeed worthy of our learning, you cannot persist like this.</p><p></p><p>If you collapse, who else can inspire us like you?</p><p></p><p>Furthermore, Ye Xiao cut off your arms, and if you eat his things, that would be the revenge. If you don't eat, he will only be happier, because he saved the trouble, and next time he comes, he'll just cut you again.</p><p></p><p>Isn't that right?"</p>

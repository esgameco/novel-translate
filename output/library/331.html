        <h1>Chapter 331</h1>
        <div class="content">
            <p>Here is the full English translation of the Chinese excerpt:</p><p></p><p>The Azure Dragon still did not let go, his expression still calm and composed.</p><p></p><p>"Let the two senior predecessors go up, it will only restrict him and make it inconvenient for him to unleash his abilities. </p><p></p><p>Just watch carefully, the time to witness a miracle is coming."</p><p></p><p>The expressions of Emperor Jing and Emperor Yun were filled with bewilderment. </p><p></p><p>They did not know why the Azure Dragon had such great confidence.</p><p></p><p>After all, no matter how powerful Ye Xiao's combat ability was, it was impossible for him to cultivate a dual cultivation technique and also reach a high level in the art of body refinement.</p><p></p><p>A person's talent is always limited.</p><p></p><p>He was now restricted by a super divine beast, and was directly facing so many imperial techniques, they absolutely did not believe he could emerge unscathed.</p><p></p><p>But regardless of whether they believed it or not, the time had already run out.</p><p></p><p>The attacks had already landed on Ye Xiao.</p><p></p><p>Nearly fifty imperial techniques, shining like brilliant stars in the night sky, struck Ye Xiao's body with great force.</p><p></p><p>The sky once again erupted in an extremely strong light, illuminating the Nine Provinces once more, covering all shadows.</p><p></p><p>The sky was completely white, as the shockwaves from the explosion scattered the clouds for miles around, not a wisp of white mist able to withstand the brilliance.</p><p></p><p>The Azure Dragon released his spiritual energy shield to help Emperor Jing and Emperor Yun resist the shockwaves, the two already severely injured and unable to easily withstand the impact.</p><p></p><p>But this was not the end, it was only the beginning.</p><p></p><p>The super divine beasts had finally grasped this opportunity, how could they easily let it go?</p><p></p><p>So in the next few seconds, various imperial techniques were unleashed in succession, all striking the light sphere that contained Ye Xiao.</p><p></p><p>As the imperial techniques became increasingly powerful, the light sphere grew larger, and the turbulence in the air became stronger.</p><p></p><p>Even the Azure Dragon below, protected by his spiritual energy shield, could not resist the air turbulence and was constantly being pushed downward by the powerful force.</p><p></p><p>The terrifying might even caused all the living beings on the land below to be suppressed, their spiritual energy constrained, their hearts shaken.</p><p></p><p>Emperor Jing and Emperor Yun, seeing this scene, revealed extremely anxious expressions on their faces.</p><p></p><p>Such powerful attack energy, even for other Emperor Realm experts, or even the two of them as veteran Emperors, would be difficult to withstand, and they would be completely annihilated.</p><p></p><p>Finally, after a full minute of continuous attack, with over five thousand imperial techniques unleashed, the super divine beasts finally stopped their assault, panting heavily.</p><p></p><p>Even so, the explosion-generated light sphere took a full twenty seconds to completely dissipate.</p><p></p><p>At this time, the entire sky seemed to have been washed clean, crystal clear and bright, without a trace of impurity.</p><p></p><p>"How is he?"</p><p></p><p>Emperor Jing and Emperor Yun immediately looked towards the direction where Ye Xiao was.</p><p></p><p>When they saw the scene, the two of them couldn't help but have their pupils constrict.</p><p></p><p>In the direction where Ye Xiao was, the beast that had trapped him had been completely carbonized after enduring so much attack energy. As for Ye Xiao, who was surrounded by it, he probably wouldn't fare much better.</p><p></p><p>In contrast to the two of them, the expressions of the beasts had finally revealed a trace of excitement.</p><p></p><p>With a gust of wind blowing, the carbonized beast was scattered like flying ash, revealing Ye Xiao's figure within.</p><p></p><p>The smiles on the beasts' faces gradually disappeared, and a few even had their smiles abruptly cut off.</p><p></p><p>Emperor Jing and Emperor Yun stared with wide eyes, their faces filled with disbelief.</p><p></p><p>"This...this...how is this possible?"</p><p></p><p>It was not that Ye Xiao had emerged completely unscathed from the intense attacks.</p><p></p><p>He had merely lost an arm, his body reddened from excessive burning, with several deep bone-exposing wounds.</p><p></p><p>Yet in the face of thousands of imperial technique attacks, the super divine beast he was with had been directly carbonized.</p><p></p><p>While he had only lost an arm and suffered a few deep wounds!</p><p></p><p>This was not child's play! How could he have only sustained such light injuries?</p><p></p><p>Did this guy cultivate the art of body refinement?</p><p></p><p>His body refinement art was actually so powerful? Did he want everyone else to just die?</p><p></p><p>Offensive and defensive dual cultivation, reaching the perfect pinnacle in both domains.</p><p></p><p>Such talent was truly a gift from the heavens!</p><p></p><p>The super divine beasts, after their brief shock, quickly reacted.</p><p></p><p>"Everyone, don't let your guard down! He's already injured. Keep attacking! I refuse to believe he's invincible. One more wave of attacks and he'll definitely die."</p><p></p><p>This statement reminded everyone, and all the beasts began to channel their spiritual energy once more.</p><p></p><p>In the next moment, a pure golden light emanated from Ye Xiao's body, and the wounds on his body were instantly healed. The severed arm grew back, completely restored.</p><p></p><p>If not for the numerous holes in his clothes, no one would have believed he had just been struck by so many imperial techniques. Emperor Jing and Emperor Yun were completely dumbfounded.</p><p></p><p>What was going on? This kid had also cultivated a healing art? And it was so powerful?</p><p></p><p>Here is the full English translation of the Chinese excerpt:</p><p></p><p>His cultivation level is so high!</p><p></p><p>He can instantly regenerate the severed limbs of Empyrean Realm experts!</p><p></p><p>This is simply pressing their worldview to the ground and grinding it repeatedly.</p><p></p><p>Grinding and grinding, making the ground as smooth as the sky.</p><p></p><p>The heads of the Supernal Beasts have completely failed to wrap their minds around it.</p><p></p><p>Their techniques have stopped in front of themselves, and they even forgot to unleash them.</p><p></p><p>Ye Xiao twisted his neck, making a series of cracking sounds.</p><p></p><p>He was careless, not expecting that old Supernal Beast to have such high awareness, directly locking his mobility, wanting to resolve him in a one-for-one manner.</p><p></p><p>Fortunately, his Body Tempering Art is no longer the previous Empyrean Realm Indestructible Divine Skill.</p><p></p><p>But it has been upgraded to the Great Perfection Divine Body!</p><p></p><p>The Great Perfection Divine Body, cultivating the soul, body, and heart as one, if the attack does not reach an extreme limit, it is impossible for them to cause him much harm by simultaneously destroying these three aspects.</p><p></p><p>Just now, the five thousand Empyrean Techniques were so overwhelmingly powerful that they severed one of his arms and left him covered in wounds, but ultimately failed to take his life.</p><p></p><p>Now, it's his turn to act!</p><p></p><p>With a slight movement of his gaze, Ye Xiao instantly disappeared from the original spot.</p><p></p><p>Reappearing, he is now in front of one of the Supernal Beasts.</p><p></p><p>The Fissure Star Fist is directly unleashed, colliding with the Empyrean Technique that the opponent had already condensed in its mouth but had not yet released.</p><p></p><p>Boom! The terrifying power of the divine technique completely destroyed the opponent's Empyrean Technique, causing it to explode.</p><p></p><p>But before the Empyrean Technique could even burst open, Ye Xiao's fist had already pierced through the Supernal Beast's massive throat.</p><p></p><p>Blood sprayed, under the starry sky, reflecting the moonlight and the stars, appearing both beautiful and tragic.</p><p></p><p>"Damn it! I'm not playing anymore!"</p><p></p><p>In the blink of an eye, another Supernal Beast pulled its leg and ran, turning into a beam of light shooting into the sky, disappearing like lightning under the starry sky.</p><p></p><p>There's no way, they can't fight like this.</p><p></p><p>Ye Xiao's attacks are impenetrable to them, and his defenses are unbreakable.</p><p></p><p>Even if they break through, the opponent still has healing arts! How can they play like this? This guy is simply an unrivaled existence within the same realm!</p><p></p><p>If they continue fighting like this, not only these few dozen Supernal Beasts, even if it's a hundred, or even hundreds of them, they may not be enough for him to kill.</p><p></p><p>Probably not until there are seven or eight hundred Supernal Beasts above, can they even dream of directly confronting him. Without a thousand Supernal Beasts, they have no chance of killing him.</p><p></p><p>"Black Abyss Beast! You bastard! Who gave you permission to run? Get back here!"</p><p></p><p>Another Supernal Beast quickly rushed to chase after it.</p><p></p><p>The other Beasts are so angry that they are coughing up blood. Everyone knows what it means, nothing more than wanting to use the excuse of chasing the Black Abyss Beast to flee this place.</p><p></p><p>With two Beasts escaping in succession, the Supernal Beasts' morale is completely in disarray, unable to continue resisting.</p><p></p><p>The attack order is in chaos, and the Beasts can't even catch Ye Xiao's shadow, let alone hitting each other.</p><p></p><p>The entire Supernal Beast legion is in complete disarray.</p><p></p><p>Ye Xiao seized the opportunity to slaughter indiscriminately.</p><p></p><p>First, he beheaded a Supernal Beast with a single sword strike, then unleashed the Empyrean Realm Claw Technique - Rend the Celestial, piercing through the chest of another Supernal Beast and tearing it apart.</p><p></p><p>"Damn it! I'm not playing either!"</p><p></p><p>In the blink of an eye, another Beast fled, then a second, a third, a fourth... until all the Supernal Beasts were in full retreat.</p><p></p><p>At this moment, Ye Xiao ruthlessly trampled the dignity of the Supernal Beasts, crushing it to powder!</p><p></p><p>Cloud Emperor and Jing Emperor were moved, their eyes misting over with tears.</p><p></p><p>How many years has it been?</p><p></p><p>It's been hundreds of years, or perhaps an even longer time.</p><p></p><p>They haven't seen such a scene in a very long time! In that era, outstanding talents of the Human Clan emerged one after another, with geniuses rising up. From Qin Shi Huang and Han Wu to the emperors of the Tang and Song dynasties, one after another of these peerless geniuses crushed the Supernal Beasts, leaving them unable to even raise their heads.</p><p></p><p>The Human Clan trampled the Supernal Beast tribe, completely reducing them to prey, to resources.</p><p></p><p>In the past few hundred years, with the decline and fall of the Human Clan, they have ultimately been crushed by the Supernal Beasts, and may even face the possibility of extinction.</p><p></p><p>The dignity of the Human Clan has long since vanished.</p><p></p><p>But now, Ye Xiao is not only a victor, but he has also regained the dignity that originally belonged to the Human Clan.</p><p></p><p>His contribution is no less than those legendary geniuses who left a deep mark in the history of the Nine Realms!</p><p></p><p>Ye Xiao was chasing and killing them, about to catch up, when Cloud Emperor shouted from behind:</p><p></p><p>"Don't pursue the cornered enemy! There are even stronger existences in the starry sky. Their strength is greater, you cannot rashly go there."</p><p></p><p>Ye Xiao, who was happily slaughtering, frowned slightly, but ultimately chose to believe Cloud Emperor's words and did not continue the pursuit.</p><p></p><p>As the saying goes, "If you don't listen to the old, you'll suffer in front of your eyes."</p><p></p><p>Cloud Emperor has already witnessed Ye Xiao's strength, and he still says this, so there must be a reason.</p><p></p><p>Being cautious won't do any harm.</p><p></p><p>This is the first update, 3,000 words.</p><p></p><p>Please recommend and vote. </p><p></p><p>Thank you to the readers Time and People, 160526230536021, Difficult to Hide Loneliness, Day and Night Upside Down, and the reader who donated, your support is greatly appreciated.</p><p></p><p>The author will try to update earlier and make more efforts to update regularly. I'm not fully recovered yet, but I'm no longer in serious trouble. In a couple of days, I should be able to return to normal. If the plot can be stabilized, I'll try to increase the update frequency to repay everyone!</p><p></p><p>(Chapter end)</p>

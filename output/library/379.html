        <h1>Chapter 379</h1>
        <div class="content">
            <p>Here is the full English translation of the Chinese excerpt:</p><p></p><p>The formation was stretched by the various imperial realm experts, like a fishing net fixed by nails. Although it only required a tiny bit of energy, the power it unleashed was exceptionally strong. To break through it would be no easy feat!</p><p></p><p>"While the formation is suppressing him, let's attack."</p><p></p><p>At this moment, the remaining imperial realm experts of the Black Soul Clan rushed over in an instant, their hearts and minds in sync.</p><p></p><p>Ye Xiao still had one hand grasping Xiong Bengang's soul, while the other hand was casting the Annihilation Treasure Art.</p><p></p><p>He clenched his fist and raised his hand to meet the closest imperial realm expert of the Black Soul Clan. Their fists collided, and the opponent's fist shattered like an egg, turning into a mist of blood.</p><p></p><p>His body was moving too fast to react, and as it continued forward, his arm came into contact with Ye Xiao's fist imbued with the Annihilation Treasure Art, shattering it inch by inch.</p><p></p><p>"No—!"</p><p></p><p>A look of terror flashed across his eyes.</p><p></p><p>Because he knew that if he collided with Ye Xiao's fist, he would be utterly destroyed without a trace. His divine body could not withstand Ye Xiao's punch.</p><p></p><p>But his agonizing scream was only his final struggle, as the next moment, Ye Xiao's fist directly blew apart his head.</p><p></p><p>Under the Annihilation Treasure Art, no one could withstand this strike.</p><p></p><p>All of this happened in an instant, and the others couldn't even react in time.</p><p></p><p>The second imperial realm expert had already charged forward, and Ye Xiao spread his fingers, transforming his fist into a palm strike. With a single slash, the opponent's neck was severed, their head and body separated, rolling away in the distance.</p><p></p><p>The palm strike continued its momentum, slicing through the body of the third imperial realm expert like a sharp blade.</p><p></p><p>Each strike was an instant kill, each move a complete domination.</p><p></p><p>It was like an art form.</p><p></p><p>In just a single second, Ye Xiao unleashed a series of attacks, frantically slaughtering the Black Soul Clan's experts.</p><p></p><p>One, two, three Black Soul Clan experts fell like moths to a flame, their bodies dropping at Ye Xiao's feet like falling dumplings.</p><p></p><p>In the blink of an eye, dozens of figures had fallen at Ye Xiao's feet, reaching up to his thighs.</p><p></p><p>This terrifying sight was like a bucket of cold water poured over the heads of the onlookers, causing the Black Soul Clan members to widen their eyes in horror and frantically retreat.</p><p></p><p>"Damn it! He's so strong! Retreat! Retreat!"</p><p></p><p>But how could Ye Xiao possibly let them escape so easily? Those who dared to attack him were doomed.</p><p></p><p>The Severing Stellar River was activated, and all the fleeing Black Soul Clan experts were restrained, as if invisible ropes were binding their bodies and forcibly pulling them back.</p><p></p><p>"No—!"</p><p></p><p>The cries of anguish and terror from the experts were endless, their eyes bulging as they desperately tried to escape, but to no avail. They could only watch helplessly as they were pulled back.</p><p></p><p>At this moment, even Xiong Bengang was filled with despair.</p><p></p><p>He finally understood the grave mistake he had made.</p><p></p><p>He should never have brought Ye Xiao back.</p><p></p><p>This was a true demon.</p><p></p><p>In his selfish desire to save his own life, he had tried to lure Ye Xiao in, hoping his clan could slay him. But in reality, he had doomed his own clan.</p><p></p><p>Now, the retribution had fallen upon his head.</p><p></p><p>He finally realized why Ye Xiao had not killed him, even though he knew Ye Xiao had betrayed him. It was because Ye Xiao had intentionally done this, wanting Xiong Bengang to witness the slaughter of his own clan.</p><p></p><p>This despair was a hundred, a thousand times more agonizing than being killed directly. "Kill me! Kill me!"</p><p></p><p>Xiong Bengang's soul raged, but Ye Xiao showed no intention of striking him down. Due to Ye Xiao's restraint, Xiong Bengang couldn't even guide his own soul to self-destruct.</p><p></p><p>What an utter hopelessness, a powerlessness that penetrated the very depths of his soul.</p><p></p><p>Ye Xiao's gaze remained unwavering.</p><p></p><p>The law of the jungle, the way they had treated the Silver Fox Clan – was this not the same? Mercy towards enemies is cruelty towards oneself.</p><p></p><p>Before Xiong Bengang's eyes, Ye Xiao systematically slaughtered all the imperial realm experts of the Black Soul Clan. No matter how desperately Xiong Bengang cried out in despair, it had no effect whatsoever.</p><p></p><p>At this moment, the distant Black Soul Clan experts who had been discussing matters with the other clans – three imperial realm experts at the ninth level – suddenly seemed to sense something, their minds shaken, and they exclaimed in horror, "Damn it! Our Black Soul Clan is under attack!"</p><p></p><p>With those words, the three Black Soul Clan experts immediately activated their Substitution Technique.</p><p></p><p>The Substitution Technique of the Black Soul Clan was a unique divine ability that their ancestral patriarch had mastered when he became an emperor-level expert. It possessed a unique spatial teleportation ability, allowing them to instantly reach their pre-arranged substitutes.</p><p></p><p>The other clan experts were taken aback.</p><p></p><p>"The Black Soul Clan is under assault? Could it be the XuanYuan Clan?"</p><p></p><p>"Regardless, we are all in an alliance now and should help each other. Old me shall go take a look."</p><p></p><p>"That's a good idea. Elder Minglu, a half-step Deicide expert, is renowned. Unless the opponent is a Deicide, they would not be a match for Elder Minglu."</p><p></p><p>"With Elder Minglu's involvement, this matter will be settled."</p><p></p><p>On the Black Soul Clan's star island, Ye Xiao was slaughtering left and right when suddenly, three overwhelming auras erupted from the three imperial realm experts controlling the formation.</p><p></p><p>Their auras soared, from imperial realm first level, to second, third, and fourth, until they reached the terrifying ninth level of the imperial realm in the blink of an eye.</p><p></p><p>Xiong Bengang's previously despairing gaze was suddenly lit up, and he began to feel excited.</p><p></p><p>Here is the full English translation of the Chinese excerpt:</p><p></p><p>Come.</p><p></p><p>"It is a powerful cultivator at the Ninth Realm of the Divine Boundary, a powerful cultivator of our Black Soul Clan at the Ninth Realm of the Divine Boundary! Hahaha!"</p><p></p><p>The three surging auras reached the Ninth Realm of the Divine Boundary and instantly rushed towards Ye Xiao's face.</p><p></p><p>"You bastard, how dare you kill our Black Soul Clan members, seeking death!"</p><p></p><p>The three attacked from three different directions, three dark streaks of light like lightning bolts, filled with unstoppable and terrifying power, arriving at Ye Xiao's side in an instant.</p><p></p><p>Ye Xiao was calm and collected, activating his divine eyes, and the trajectories of the three instantly slowed down in his sight.</p><p></p><p>The Annihilation Treasure Techniques were deployed one after another, with overwhelming power descending from above and striking the three. The attacks should have been sequential, but due to their extreme speed, they appeared to be completed in a single moment.</p><p></p><p>Boom! Three explosions sounded simultaneously.</p><p></p><p>The three Ninth Realm Divine Boundary experts were directly blasted into three bloody mists, brilliant like crimson flowers.</p><p></p><p>In that instant, Xiong Bengang was completely and utterly hopeless.</p><p></p><p>His smile completely froze, and the tremendous shock had pushed his endurance to the limit, causing him to laugh crazily, both mad and foolish.</p><p></p><p>The remaining Emperor Realm Black Soul Clan members also lost their confidence.</p><p></p><p>But even so, someone still shouted:</p><p></p><p>"Everyone, don't give up! As long as we can control the formation, he won't be able to get out. If we give up and no one activates the formation, he'll immediately escape from it."</p><p></p><p>But as soon as these words were spoken, Ye Xiao raised his right foot and stomped the ground.</p><p></p><p>Boom! The power of the Annihilation Treasure Technique was fully unleashed, directly and mercilessly destroying the formation on the ground.</p><p></p><p>The violent explosion shockwaves directly injured and blew away these Emperor Realm experts, causing them to vomit blood and fall to the ground.</p><p></p><p>The Silver Fox Clan members angrily charged forward.</p><p></p><p>"Kill them all!"</p><p>"Avenge our fallen clansmen."</p><p></p><p>The foxes frantically tore and devoured the Black Soul Clan bodies, absorbing their divine blood to continuously strengthen their own power.</p><p></p><p>But soon, a much more powerful aura suddenly appeared in the sky, distorting the stars as it descended upon Ye Xiao's head.</p><p></p><p>"Young man, which clan do you belong to? How dare you attack the allies of our Northern Mourn Clan, and so ruthlessly slaughter so many Black Soul Clan members, isn't that a bit too much?"</p><p></p><p>Ning Yutian's heart trembled.</p><p></p><p>"Such a powerful aura, even stronger than the Patriarch's!"</p><p></p><p>The Vixen Queen gritted her teeth.</p><p></p><p>"His cultivation is likely even stronger than Senior Ye's. Senior Ye's strength should be at the Ninth Realm of the Divine Boundary, while his power has probably reached the Verge of Deicide!"</p><p></p><p>"What?!"</p><p></p><p>Hearing this, Ning Yutian's heart shook again, filled with the utmost worry.</p><p></p><p>The Verge of Deicide! That was an existence with one foot already in the Deicide Realm!</p><p>Could the Patriarch really resist him?</p><p></p><p>As they spoke, a massive palm technique suddenly descended from the sky, covering an area of 100,000 meters in diameter, within which no living being could escape.</p><p>The other party clearly intended to slaughter Ye Xiao and the entire Silver Fox Clan.</p><p></p><p>Facing this attack, Ye Xiao was completely unfazed.</p><p>He directly threw Xiong Bengang's body, which was immediately blasted apart by the palm strike.</p><p></p><p>Then Ye Xiao arrived, unleashing a Rift Star Fist that charged towards the palm print.</p><p></p><p>Boom! The two forces were incredibly powerful, and the moment they collided, a golden light wave rapidly spread outwards.</p><p></p><p>Ye Xiao's fist power managed to push the palm print back slightly, but it was soon suppressed again.</p><p></p><p>The other party seemed surprised and couldn't help but speak:</p><p></p><p>"Hmm? My Northern Mourn Palm is a Six-Star Divine Technique, an inherited divine art of our Northern Mourn Clan. And my strength is far superior to yours, yet your technique was able to resist my attack for a moment. It seems this move of yours is no ordinary divine art.</p><p></p><p>Since that's the case, I'll subdue you and force you to reveal this divine art."</p><p></p><p>Ye Xiao remained calm and collected. Seeing his Rift Star Fist being suppressed, he directly infused the Annihilation Treasure Technique into it.</p><p></p><p>The previously dominant Northern Mourn Palm suddenly let out a crisp 'crack' sound.</p><p></p><p>The next moment, it was directly shattered by Ye Xiao's fist.</p><p></p><p>"What?!"</p><p></p><p>The Northern Mourn Elder's pupils shrank, unable to believe his eyes.</p><p>He felt the terrifying power of Ye Xiao's attack and exclaimed in shock, "No, this is not a divine art! This is not a divine art! This is an Ancient Treasure Technique! How can you possibly have an Ancient Treasure Technique? I don't believe it, I don't believe it!"</p><p></p><p>Unfortunately, no matter how much he refused to believe it, Ye Xiao had already struck, and he had no way to evade it.</p><p></p><p>Ye Xiao's figure, enveloped in a nine-colored aura, soared towards him, also infusing Yin-Yang Evasion to maximize his speed.</p><p></p><p>"Boom!"</p><p></p><p>Under the Annihilation Treasure Technique, the Verge of Deicide expert, the Northern Mourn Elder, was punched through the heart by Ye Xiao, falling like an exhausted star.</p><p></p><p>One update, three thousand words.</p><p>Please recommend and vote.</p><p></p><p>(Chapter end)</p>

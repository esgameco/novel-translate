        <h1>Chapter 60</h1>
        <div class="content">
            <p>Here is the full English translation of the excerpt from the Chinese novel:</p><p></p><p>Pao Jiansheng and Ning Yuheng were both startled.</p><p></p><p>"What a bold person!" </p><p></p><p>Ning Yuheng couldn't help but murmur.</p><p></p><p>An outlaw beyond the law, doesn't that mean that even the law cannot constrain him?</p><p></p><p>Then how powerful must he be?</p><p></p><p>A Sage Emperor? </p><p></p><p>Or even a top-tier existence among the Sage Emperors?</p><p></p><p>You must know that at the peak of Grand Masters, the existence of Innate Sixth-Grade is already considered a national treasure-level warrior.</p><p></p><p>But even a national treasure-level warrior cannot escape the constraints of the law.</p><p></p><p>Like in the Hanzhou region, there is only the Sage Emperor Liu Chengxun, as well as a few other peak Grand Masters who are national treasure-level warriors, rare like giant pandas, who may be relatively more tolerant.</p><p></p><p>But in the Nine Provinces, it is absolutely impossible!</p><p></p><p>This ancient country with five thousand years of brilliant martial arts civilization! Experts abound! National treasure-level warriors, although precious, are not to the point of having to worship them.</p><p></p><p>And since the other party dares to call himself an outlaw beyond the law, he is definitely not an ordinary person.</p><p></p><p>Ye Xiao Taixuan Tiangong casually checked the thoughts of the two, and when he knew their train of thought, he became completely silent.</p><p></p><p>He didn't expect that the random person he had fabricated could evoke such imagination in the two of them. If this kind of imagination was used for cultivation, how wonderful would it be? To have a brain but not use it, just playing around? "Where is he?"</p><p></p><p>"He has already left, and I don't know where he went, probably wandering the world."</p><p></p><p>"Is that so? That's really a pity."</p><p></p><p>Pao Jiansheng sighed softly.</p><p></p><p>And Ning Yuheng couldn't help but ask curiously:</p><p></p><p>"It shouldn't be that way, right? These two cultivation techniques are only Extraordinary-grade, not even reaching the Grandmaster level! Can the creator of these be such a powerful existence?"</p><p></p><p>Pao Jiansheng shook his head.</p><p></p><p>"Your realms are a bit lower, so you can't see the profundity within. </p><p></p><p>When a master creates, even the most ordinary techniques, there is an unimaginable realm of the martial dao contained within.</p><p></p><p>There's a saying that goes, 'In the hands of the weak, even the strongest sword is no match for the small stone in the hands of the strong.'</p><p></p><p>Although these two cultivation techniques are only Extraordinary-grade in rank, their true value can no longer be simply measured by their grade as a commodity."</p><p></p><p>After a pause, he spoke again:</p><p></p><p>"I want to buy these two cultivation techniques, I wonder if the manager is willing to sell them to me."</p><p></p><p>Ye Xiao looked at Ning Yuheng.</p><p></p><p>"I've already sold the cultivation techniques to him, so if you want to buy them, you'll need his consent."</p><p></p><p>Pao Jiansheng looked at Ning Yuheng, and Ning Yuheng secretly glanced at Ye Xiao.</p><p></p><p>"This was given to me by the manager, if I sell it, wouldn't that be a bit too much?"</p><p></p><p>Ye Xiao shook his head.</p><p></p><p>"Since I've given it to you, it's yours now. You can dispose of it as you please, no need to be polite."</p><p></p><p>Ning Yuheng nodded.</p><p></p><p>"To be honest, I can't understand these two cultivation techniques either. If his offer is suitable, I'll sell them, and I'll treat you to a meal then."</p><p></p><p>Ye Xiao nodded.</p><p></p><p>The value of an Extraordinary-grade cultivation technique is indeed not small, but due to severe plagiarism, there are many printed copies of the same level, normally around 10,000 per copy, so the two of them are not even worth 30,000.</p><p></p><p>Only truly Grandmaster-level cultivation techniques are considered valuable, starting from hundreds of thousands.</p><p></p><p>He himself is not a greedy person, and he has already given it to Ning Yuheng and exchanged it for the healing technique of the Silver Fox Clan. For a few tens of thousands, to come back and take it would make him look too despicable and stingy.</p><p></p><p>He also doesn't fear this cultivation technique falling into the hands of Hanzhou, as it was just something he casually wrote, completely failing to display his true abilities. Even if the Hanzhou people get it, it won't be of much use, as he can instantly create more and stronger cultivation techniques for the Nine Provinces.</p><p></p><p>"Hmm." Pao Jiansheng fell silent for a moment, then spoke again:</p><p></p><p>"Then I'll give you 100,000 for one cultivation technique, and 240,000 for both!"</p><p></p><p>The air suddenly fell into a deathly silence.</p><p></p><p>Ye Xiao: "ヾ(o゜_，゜o)ノ!"</p><p></p><p>Ning Yuheng: "ヾ(o゜_，゜o)ノ!"</p><p></p><p>Pao Jiansheng raised an eyebrow slightly.</p><p></p><p>"Is it not enough? Then... I'll add 2,000 more per technique, 240,000 in total for both."</p><p></p><p>Ning Yuheng waved his hands repeatedly.</p><p></p><p>"Enough, enough. But..."</p><p></p><p>Here is the full English translation of the Chinese excerpt:</p><p></p><p>"Do you really want to spend 240,000 on these two cultivation techniques? This price is far beyond the market price, isn't it?"</p><p></p><p>Park Jian-sheng smiled calmly:</p><p></p><p>"For a martial artist, if you encounter a cultivation technique that you like, no matter how expensive it is, you have to buy it. This is a masterpiece, worth a fortune! Moreover, I am a disciple of the Sword Saint of Han Zhou, and I receive a monthly allowance."</p><p></p><p>"Oh, I see. Then let's go with this price."</p><p></p><p>Ning Yu-hen said enviously, and Park Jian-sheng nodded.</p><p></p><p>"Send me your card number, I'll transfer the money to you. I recently opened a bank account at the Industrial and Commercial Bank in Jiuzhou."</p><p></p><p>"Okay."</p><p></p><p>The two completed the transaction, and after obtaining the cultivation technique, Park Jian-sheng bid farewell to the two and left.</p><p></p><p>The air fell silent again, and Ning Yu-hen slowly spoke:</p><p></p><p>"Manager, why don't we split the money?"</p><p></p><p>Ye Xiao was very gratified, after all, this was his loyal subordinate, and his efforts were not in vain.</p><p></p><p>However, as Ning Yu-hen's superior, the manager, if he were to directly accept it, it would seem a bit too eager and lacking in grace.</p><p></p><p>He should give way a little.</p><p></p><p>"No need, you keep it. After all, this is an exchange between you and me."</p><p></p><p>"Okay! Manager, you are truly noble-minded. I'll follow your instructions. Tonight I'll go check on the hotel, and tomorrow I'll definitely treat the manager to a big meal, I won't let the manager down."</p><p></p><p>The word "exchange" hadn't even left his mouth, and Ning Yu-hen's words directly choked it back down his throat.</p><p></p><p>Ye Xiao: "(⊙⊙)!"</p><p></p><p>This guy is a bit out of the ordinary.</p><p></p><p>Shouldn't he have politely declined again, and then reluctantly accept it?</p><p></p><p>Oh well, it was originally something I exchanged with him, and he even asked if I wanted to split the money. Whose fault is it that I insisted on acting high and mighty? However, after this incident, Ye Xiao gained a deeper understanding of his own strength.</p><p></p><p>It seems that in the future, he should be more low-key.</p><p></p><p>Writing a cultivation technique just like that and it's worth so much, it's too high-profile and dangerous.</p><p></p><p>Of course, he won't go write cultivation techniques to make money.</p><p></p><p>It's not that interesting anyway, material wealth is ultimately external, far less important than strengthening one's own abilities.</p><p></p><p>Moreover, people like Park Jian-sheng who can appreciate the value are not that many.</p><p></p><p>Ning Yu-hen looked at it for a long time, he didn't know the value of this cultivation technique.</p><p></p><p>Similarly, people like Park Jian-sheng who are willing to spend money are also not many.</p><p></p><p>Time flew by, and it was already time to get off work in the evening. Ning Yu-hen really went to check on the hotel, and Ye Xiao's cultivation technique had already been cultivated to the Great Perfection realm, and the ten sheets of paper imprinted with the technique were emitting a pure golden color.</p><p></p><p>He exhaled a mouthful of turbid air and headed towards home.</p><p></p><p>It's time to complete the new fusion.</p><p></p><p>(Three more, please support. Regarding Sword Saint Liu Cheng-xun and Park Jian-sheng, let me explain. 1. Liu Cheng-xun is the only expert in Han Zhou, but there are more than one high-level experts of the same realm in Jiuzhou. But it's impossible for him to come to Jiuzhou and all the high-level experts gather for him, he doesn't have that kind of capital yet. His ranking is only 47th in the world, and the higher-ranked Jiuzhou experts are more. Would the number one expert bother to act for him? Obviously not! So in this situation, ordinary people's awe of him is certainly reasonable, I think it's very reasonable. 2. The national strength of Jiuzhou is set to have suffered heavy losses in the past two hundred years due to the schemes of the powers, leading to a weakening, but it is still the strongest in the world, but certainly not as strong as the Qin, Han, Tang, and Song dynasties. 3. Park Jian-sheng defeated the genius of Jing Zhou by suppressing his cultivation, only relying on sword intent and sword techniques. If he had unleashed his full cultivation, he might have lost long ago, as I mentioned in the previous chapter. And he only defeated Jing Zhou, Jiuzhou still has eight other states, he hasn't started challenging them! 4. The previous chapter also mentioned that the people of Han Zhou migrated to Jiuzhou, and they are also descendants of Jiuzhou, with the same blood and genes. Under this, Han Zhou mobilized the entire country to cultivate a Liu Cheng-xun, I don't think this is unreasonable. After all, Han Zhou is equivalent to a large city in Jiuzhou, right? Jiuzhou has dozens of them, about the same proportion, if Han Zhou has one, is that not enough? Do you have to say that I underestimate the national strength of our country? Think about it carefully, if he was really strong enough, why would he appear in the front, and you can't level up to fight the big dragon right away, right? The powerful experts of Jiuzhou are certainly saved for later! Thank you!)</p><p></p><p>(This chapter is complete)</p>

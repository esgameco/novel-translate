        <h1>Chapter 97</h1>
        <div class="content">
            <p>Here is the full English translation of the Chinese excerpt:</p><p></p><p>The hearts of the crowd sank once again.</p><p></p><p>Pao Jiansheng had defeated Qin Yuyan, and he had just fought against Sasaki Taro, so he had more say than anyone else.</p><p></p><p>But Dou Changfeng and the others didn't say anything. </p><p></p><p>Because they saw the situation more clearly.</p><p></p><p>They already knew that Qin Yuyan had no chance of defeating Sasaki Taro.</p><p></p><p>It couldn't be helped - Qin Yuyan's training in the blade arts was far too short.</p><p></p><p>Even if that senior predecessor's blade techniques were excellent, it was impossible for Qin Yuyan to be elevated to such an extraordinary level in such a short time.</p><p></p><p>But it didn't matter, even if Qin Yuyan lost, the Nine Provinces still had more powerful geniuses who could definitely defeat Sasaki Taro and restore the honor of the Nine Provinces!</p><p></p><p>On the field, Sasaki Taro stood arrogantly, his eyes half-closed.</p><p></p><p>Sensing Qin Yuyan's arrival, he slowly opened his eyes, but only halfway, not fully.</p><p></p><p>He slightly raised his chin and glanced at Qin Yuyan out of the corner of his eye.</p><p></p><p>He didn't even take Qin Yuyan seriously.</p><p></p><p>Not only was Qin Yuyan an unknown figure before, but she had also been defeated by Pao Jiansheng.</p><p></p><p>The disciple of his disciple's disciple, that was certainly his own disciple's disciple.</p><p></p><p>If it weren't for recording the event, he wouldn't even bother to look at Qin Yuyan twice.</p><p></p><p>Let alone spar with her! "Since you are a delicate woman, you can make the first move."</p><p></p><p>Sasaki Taro spoke indifferently, his tone revealing a hint of disdain, as if he had completely disregarded Qin Yuyan.</p><p></p><p>Qin Yuyan seemed to have already seen through his arrogance, but she did not strike first.</p><p></p><p>With a firm gaze, neither sad nor happy, she calmly said:</p><p></p><p>"This is my home field, and you are the guest, so naturally you should make the first move."</p><p></p><p>Sasaki Taro narrowed his eyes slightly.</p><p></p><p>"You are playing with fire!"</p><p></p><p>Qin Yuyan no longer spoke, only tightly gripping the hilt of her sword.</p><p></p><p>Seeing this, a surge of anger rose in Sasaki Taro's eyes.</p><p></p><p>He had been looked down upon by a woman.</p><p></p><p>And not just any woman, but the disciple of his disciple's disciple.</p><p></p><p>This was no different from being looked down upon by a piece of trash. Whoosh! He drew his long sword and coldly said:</p><p></p><p>"The sword knows no eyes, and if I accidentally maim you, don't blame me!"</p><p></p><p>With that, he lightly stepped, instantly leaving his original position.</p><p></p><p>With the same level of martial arts cultivation as Pao Jiansheng, suppressed to the realm of the Posterior Heaven Fifth Grade.</p><p></p><p>But his speed was even faster than Pao Jiansheng's! The key to the Iga-ryu ninja sword technique lies in this.</p><p></p><p>This sword technique had already transcended the realm of ordinary sword techniques.</p><p></p><p>Its terrifying speed and bizarre movement path, like a fierce ghost, sent shivers down the spines of the onlookers.</p><p></p><p>"Such a fast sword!" </p><p></p><p>Qin Yuyan stood still, not moving an inch.</p><p></p><p>Sasaki Taro's speed was extremely fast, almost in an instant, he had already arrived in front of her.</p><p></p><p>Ten meters, five meters, three meters, one meter! Just as Sasaki Taro reached her side, Qin Yuyan suddenly struck.</p><p></p><p>A sword drawn out like lightning.</p><p></p><p>Seeing this sword strike, all the high-level experts on the scene couldn't help but have their hearts suddenly shaken, their eyes wide open, revealing a deep sense of disbelief.</p><p></p><p>The most unbelievable one was Sasaki Taro!</p><p></p><p>At this moment, he was closest to Qin Yuyan, so he could best feel the strength of Qin Yuyan's sword intent!</p><p></p><p>This move almost made his heart struggle to breathe! It was not a suppression of cultivation, but a pure crushing of martial dao intent!</p><p></p><p>It was only at this moment that he realized he had underestimated this girl.</p><p></p><p>Completely overlooked her.</p><p></p><p>Boom! Without giving him time to think further, the next moment, their swords collided!</p><p></p><p>Here is the full English translation of the Chinese excerpt:</p><p></p><p>Between the blades, due to the violent impact, a dazzling shower of sparks instantly burst forth. As for Sasaki Taro, he felt his sword intent being completely crushed by Qin Yuyan's sword intent, overwhelmed in a manner that was utterly unmatched!</p><p></p><p>The opponent's blade edge even made his skin feel a tearing, slicing sensation!</p><p></p><p>The next moment, he was cleaved and sent flying.</p><p></p><p>Thud! Sasaki Taro was split and sent flying dozens of meters away, finally crashing heavily to the ground.</p><p></p><p>In an instant, the entire martial arts hall fell into a deathly silence.</p><p></p><p>Everyone stared with wide eyes, unable to believe the scene before them.</p><p></p><p>The almost universally doubted Qin Yuyan had actually just cleaved Sasaki Taro with a single stroke? This had to be a joke, right? Even the spectators like Cheng Feng were dumbfounded.</p><p></p><p>She won? </p><p></p><p>So easily?</p><p></p><p>Pang Jiansheng had been defeated, and now Qin Yuyan had defeated her opponent with a single sword strike? Were they dreaming?</p><p></p><p>Could it be that the sword intent of that senior had reached such a transcendent level? After all, Qin Yuyan's natural talent was well-known, so there was no way she could have mastered the sword to such a profound degree.</p><p></p><p>It could only be said that she had relied on that sword intent to make up for the deficiencies in her natural talent.</p><p></p><p>Monstrous! Utterly monstrous! That senior, was truly not human!</p><p></p><p>A god!</p><p></p><p>The true god of the sword! "Clap clap clap"</p><p></p><p>Pang Jiansheng was the first to start applauding.</p><p></p><p>His eyes were shining with excitement.</p><p></p><p>Of course, he was not excited because Qin Yuyan had won, but because the Nine Prefectures martial arts had won! Was this the Nine Prefectures that the master had spoken of? A realm with countless brilliant martial arts civilizations!</p><p></p><p>Though he had been shocked before during his time in the Nine Prefectures, that was only a shock towards an extraordinary expert. If it had been another extraordinary expert from another country, he might have been equally shocked.</p><p></p><p>But now, he truly felt the charm of the martial arts culture of the Nine Prefectures.</p><p></p><p>In just a few months, Qin Yuyan had transformed from a novice swordswoman into such a powerful expert.</p><p></p><p>What kind of existence was the sword intent she had obtained?</p><p></p><p>And what realm of attainment did the powerful expert behind her possess?</p><p></p><p>Pang Jiansheng felt at that moment that it no longer mattered whether he returned to Korea or not.</p><p></p><p>The martial arts of the world were centered in the Nine Prefectures, were they not?</p><p></p><p>It was decided, he would not leave. </p><p></p><p>He already had seven-eighths Nine Prefectures bloodline, so he could already be considered a Nine Prefectures native.</p><p></p><p>He had no regrets about entering the Nine Prefectures for the rest of his life! After Pang Jiansheng started clapping, the others also began to applaud, and thunderous applause filled the martial arts hall.</p><p></p><p>A smile appeared on Qin Yuyan's face.</p><p></p><p>Her hand gripped the sword hilt tightly.</p><p></p><p>In this moment, she had not only defeated Sasaki Taro, but also Pang Jiansheng!</p><p></p><p>She had washed away the humiliation of her previous defeat!</p><p></p><p>Her heart was boiling with excitement.</p><p></p><p>Senior, did you see that?</p><p></p><p>Although you did not take me as a disciple, I will absolutely not bring you shame.</p>

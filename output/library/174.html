        <h1>Chapter 174</h1>
        <div class="content">
            <p>Here is the full English translation of the Chinese excerpt:</p><p></p><p>In fact, he could not just randomly kill people, because in our Jianghai City, after all, there is the senior Daojian Xian.</p><p></p><p>Even without Daojian Xian, the other powerful cultivators in the Nine Realms would not allow him to randomly kill people.</p><p></p><p>But the experts from various places could not possibly stay in a small place like Jianghai City all the time, and Senior Daojian Xian could not be contacted at any time.</p><p></p><p>So, this is where we need to step in and maintain things.</p><p></p><p>After all, if there are some people whose minds are not right and they go looking for trouble with him, he cannot just hide like a turtle.</p><p></p><p>Once he slays them, as a powerful cultivator, he can just flee back to Hanzhou or the West, and no one can do anything about him.</p><p></p><p>The Nine Realms would not go after a powerful cultivator just for the sake of a few ordinary martial artists with water in their brains.</p><p></p><p>Understand?"</p><p></p><p>The crowd nodded, but they also felt a bit helpless.</p><p></p><p>Well, this is equivalent to bringing in a big shot for themselves, one that they cannot fight or scold, and if things get too intense, they might even get killed.</p><p></p><p>"Okay, now that everyone understands, let's move on to the next step and discuss the arrangement for Liu Chengxun."</p><p></p><p>As soon as the manager said this, the crowd immediately started speaking up.</p><p></p><p>"Manager, the area I'm in just got two female college students, and the personnel is already saturated."</p><p></p><p>"Manager, the area I'm in is on the first floor, and you know how crowded it is on the first floor. If those little brats who come to read books happen to say something inappropriate and offend him, won't that be a huge trouble?"</p><p></p><p>"Manager, my area won't work either. I have a bad temper, and I'm afraid that one day I won't be able to hold back and will spew some dirty words. If he then decides to cut me down, it would be no big deal for me, but if he ends up slashing our entire library, that would be a grave sin."</p><p></p><p>Ouyang Yunzhong's face turned cold.</p><p></p><p>"Look at you all, where's the backbone I've been cultivating in you all this time? Now when it comes to a critical moment, you're all shrinking back in fear.</p><p></p><p>Do you want me to give up my position as the manager and let him manage all of you?"</p><p></p><p>Upon hearing this, the crowd hurriedly apologized.</p><p></p><p>Ouyang Yunzhong snorted coldly, "I know the first and second floors are crowded, so I'll assign him to work on the third floor and above. The managers of the first and second floors can leave, and the managers of the third floor and above will all stay and draw lots, and whoever gets it, that's who he'll be under."</p><p></p><p>Ye Xiao was naturally among them.</p><p></p><p>However, Ye Xiao was not worried.</p><p>He could easily manipulate the drawing of lots using his Taixuan Tiangong. </p><p></p><p>It's not that he's afraid of Liu Chengxun - ten Liu Chengxuns wouldn't be enough for one of his Tathagata Divine Palms.</p><p></p><p>But Liu Chengxun has the aura of a Sword Saint, a powerful cultivator, which is bound to attract a lot of attention.</p><p></p><p>What Ye Xiao hates the most is having many people's gazes focused on him, unless he's using a disguise or wearing a mask.</p><p></p><p>And Liu Chengxun will definitely act like a big shot when he comes.</p><p>If Ye Xiao doesn't want him to be the big shot, he'll have to expose his own identity. Probably Liu Chengxun would immediately start treating him like a grandson.</p><p></p><p>But if that happens, his peaceful life would be gone.</p><p></p><p>The drawing of lots soon began.</p><p>Ouyang Yunzhong used some found small wooden sticks of varying lengths, and whoever drew the shortest one would be responsible for Liu Chengxun.</p><p></p><p>These colleagues didn't even have a single Patriarch, let alone someone at the Great Patriarch level, who could use spiritual power to search.</p><p></p><p>Ye Xiao didn't even need to activate his Taixuan Tiangong, his spiritual power swept through in an instant and he drew the longest stick.</p><p></p><p>Flawless victory!</p><p></p><p>The drawing of lots was over quickly, and in the blink of an eye, Liu Chengxun's assignment was determined - he would be under the management of Li Ye, a section manager in Ye Xiao's neighboring area.</p><p></p><p>That section manager's face instantly turned the color of pig liver.</p><p>Damn it, he drew the short stick! Ouyang Yunzhong chuckled.</p><p></p><p>"Since that's the case, then..."</p><p></p><p>"Wait a minute."</p><p>Before the manager could finish confirming, the other party had already raised his hand and shouted, "Manager, actually I've been planning to resign and start my own business recently. </p><p>I'll give you my resignation letter later."</p><p></p><p>Ouyang Yunzhong: "(╯‵□′)╯︵┻━┻!"</p><p></p><p>"Li Ye, are you being sincere?"</p><p></p><p>"Manager, I'm really not joking with you. I really want to resign."</p><p></p><p>"Okay, I'll approve it. Let Liu Chengxun take over your position, from today on he will be the section manager of your area."</p><p></p><p>Ouyang Yunzhong was quite decisive, directly dismissing Li Ye.</p><p>Li Ye didn't hesitate either, although losing this position was a loss, it was still better than living in fear every day!</p><p></p><p>Ye Xiao was also a bit helpless, he didn't expect that by avoiding having Liu Chengxun as his subordinate, he ended up with him as his neighbor instead.</p><p>It's quite annoying.</p><p></p><p>But what can he do? </p><p>After all, Liu Chengxun is a powerful cultivator, they can't just let him work in an electronics factory or go learn about sow postpartum care on a pig farm, right? </p><p>Thinking it through, the only place where Liu Chengxun can be quite idle and not affect international exchanges, while also being well-monitored, is the library.</p><p></p><p>After all, the Jianghai City Library doesn't have any Emperor Techniques, so there's no fear of Liu Chengxun secretly stealing some supreme cultivation method.</p><p></p><p>After the drawing of lots was completed, Ye Xiao quickly went back to analyze his map.</p><p>There was a high chance that he could find an Emperor Technique behind this map, and even if it was just one, as long as he could input it into the Golden Book of the Divine Soul, it would be far more beneficial than just studying basic cultivation methods here.</p><p></p><p>Here is the full English translation of the Chinese excerpt:</p><p></p><p>It was much larger.</p><p></p><p>So this was the most important thing for him right now.</p><p></p><p>However, as he had just been looking at it for about ten minutes, a gentle voice suddenly appeared in his ear.</p><p></p><p>"Hello."</p><p></p><p>Ye Xiao had already sensed that the other person was Liu Chengxun, but he had not looked up yet.</p><p></p><p>"Hello."</p><p></p><p>"I am Liu Chengxun."</p><p></p><p>"Mm."</p><p></p><p>Ye Xiao lightly hummed, and Liu Chengxun immediately said:</p><p></p><p>"You are indeed as gentle and unruffled as my disciple said, much better than other people."</p><p></p><p>Liu Chengxun had come here specifically to greet his colleagues around.</p><p></p><p>Since he had decided to stay in the Nine Provinces for a while, he certainly couldn't go around flaunting his identity as the Sword Saint of Han Province.</p><p></p><p>Otherwise, the upper echelons of the Nine Provinces Alliance would find him annoying and try to expel him.</p><p></p><p>So he needed to get along well with the people around him.</p><p></p><p>But all the people who had greeted him were trembling and shivering, as if they were facing an extremely terrifying monster.</p><p></p><p>This was unavoidable, as the Saint-Emperor's experts were too powerful, and for ordinary people, they were simply not to be provoked.</p><p></p><p>Because if they sneezed or farted, they might just kill ordinary martial artists without a trace.</p><p></p><p>After greeting many people without much change, Liu Chengxun remembered what his disciple had told him before, that there was a young man named Ye Xiao in the library who was very gentle and easy to get along with, so he came to take a look.</p><p></p><p>Now that he saw it, it was indeed the case.</p><p></p><p>"Did Pao Jiansheng tell you about me?"</p><p></p><p>"Yes, he also recommended me to come to the library. He said it's more suitable for me. The work is relatively leisurely, and it's also convenient for monitoring the Nine Provinces, so as not to make everyone nervous."</p><p></p><p>Ye Xiao was quite speechless. With your status as a big shot, even if you really went to a farm, it would still be just as leisurely. The farm owner wouldn't dare to let you lift a finger to help the mother pig give birth, and they might even have to build a luxurious office for you and send a secretary in black stockings to chat with you.</p><p></p><p>"Well, if there's nothing else, I need to get back to work."</p><p></p><p>Liu Chengxun glanced at the map in Ye Xiao's hand and couldn't help but say:</p><p></p><p>"You're analyzing the map, aren't you? This map is indeed a bit difficult. Would you like me to give it a try?"</p><p></p><p>Ye Xiao was a bit surprised.</p><p></p><p>"You can also analyze maps?"</p><p></p><p>Liu Chengxun nodded.</p><p></p><p>"I can do it a little. In my spare time cultivating, I also develop some other hobbies."</p><p></p><p>Ye Xiao thought for a moment.</p><p></p><p>"No need to bother you."</p><p></p><p>"It's okay, I'm free anyway. Let me help you analyze it."</p><p></p><p>"How can I let you do that?"</p><p></p><p>"You can just treat me to a meal, and we'll be even."</p><p></p><p>"Well, if you put it that way, I won't be polite then."</p><p></p><p>This map had indeed been troubling Ye Xiao. He hadn't learned this kind of knowledge, so even though his cultivation was high, it would still be difficult for him to analyze it in a short time.</p><p></p><p>Now that Liu Chengxun was willing to take on the task, it couldn't be better.</p><p></p><p>A meal, Ye Xiao could afford that.</p><p></p><p>Ye Xiao handed the map to Liu Chengxun, and Liu Chengxun spoke again:</p><p></p><p>"But this map can't be analyzed in just a few minutes, because I haven't seen the map of the Nine Provinces before, so I need to get my own area and compare it with the map of the Nine Provinces to analyze it. I'll be able to give you the answer before I get off work tonight."</p><p></p><p>"Okay, no problem. If you can analyze it tonight, I'll treat you to a big meal."</p><p></p><p>"It's a deal."</p><p></p><p>Liu Chengxun took the map and left, and Ye Xiao heaved a sigh of relief, finally getting rid of the troublesome map.</p><p></p><p>From the look in his eyes, Liu Chengxun didn't seem to be lying, and it probably wouldn't take long for him to analyze it.</p><p></p><p>Then Ye Xiao could go and find that mysterious cave to see what imperial techniques were inside.</p><p></p><p>And now, he could finally start to busy himself with his own affairs.</p><p></p><p>Not to read books on martial arts, but to look for books related to the cultivation of star beasts.</p><p></p><p>Ye Xiao now had the equivalent of seven Saint-Emperor-level star beasts, and if he utilized them properly, they could provide him with most of the energy he needed to advance to the peak of the Xiantian Ninth Rank.</p><p></p><p>He quickly found a large number of books:</p><p></p><p>"On How to Use Star Beasts to Get Rich"</p><p>"Postpartum Care of Star Beasts"</p><p>"On the Breeding Characteristics of Different Types of Star Beasts"</p><p></p><p>A bunch of books related to star beasts, all of which Ye Xiao read through.</p><p></p><p>He gained a lot of insights.</p><p></p><p>Before reading them, the simplest way he knew to deal with star beasts was to cut off their meat and eat it.</p><p></p><p>But after reading them, he realized that there were so many ways to utilize star beasts.</p><p></p><p>It was like repeatedly mining the same mine.</p><p></p><p>If he combined these methods well, the seven Saint-Emperor-level star beasts he had could be equivalent to dozens or even hundreds of star beasts.</p><p></p><p>Then, how could his cultivation be lacking?</p><p></p><p>Seven more, 20,001.</p><p></p><p>(End of this chapter)</p>

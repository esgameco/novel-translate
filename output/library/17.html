        <h1>Chapter 17</h1>
        <div class="content">
            <p>Here is the full English translation of the Chinese excerpt:</p><p></p><p>"Yes, yes, the purpose of our agency is to help clients find the most desirable and suitable properties. We have all kinds of housing resources available."</p><p></p><p>Ye Xiao was ushered back in.</p><p></p><p>The other party poured him a cup of tea and then placed a tablet in front of him.</p><p></p><p>"Here are the detailed introductions to the rental properties, including the layout, location, transportation, and rental prices."</p><p></p><p>Ye Xiao directly found the suburban house, flipped through a few pages, and the prices of the small rooms were basically between 600 to 800, but the rooms were too small and did not suit his needs.</p><p></p><p>He needed a larger room that could shield the anomalies when he was cultivating his fusion technique. A small room might not even be able to withstand the burst of spiritual energy during his breakthroughs, and it could directly shatter the house!</p><p></p><p>The larger rooms were not very affordable in price.</p><p></p><p>However, as he flipped through, his gaze suddenly fell on one of the small courtyards.</p><p></p><p>This small courtyard was located in a suburban village, standing alone by the roadside, a two-story building, looking to be at least over 100 square meters.</p><p></p><p>The key point was its price, 100 yuan per month.</p><p></p><p>"Is the price of this house really true?"</p><p></p><p>Ye Xiao pointed to the house on the screen, and the customer manager looked over with a smile.</p><p></p><p>"Which one?"</p><p></p><p>However, when he saw which one, his expression suddenly changed.</p><p></p><p>"Uh, maybe you should re-select another one?"</p><p></p><p>"What's wrong with this one? Is it not available?"</p><p></p><p>"It's not that it's not available, it's just that this house is haunted."</p><p></p><p>Ye Xiao was stunned, as a frequent reader, he naturally understood what the other party meant.</p><p></p><p>In this world, ghosts do indeed exist.</p><p></p><p>But not the vague and ethereal ghosts from the past, but rather the spiritual entities formed by the spiritual power of humans or star beasts after their deaths, which can attack using spiritual energy.</p><p></p><p>However, although their formation is not too troublesome, resolving them is not that simple.</p><p></p><p>There are currently two relatively scientific methods to kill such ghost-like entities.</p><p></p><p>One is to reach the level of a Grand Master, where the mastery of spiritual energy has reached an unparalleled level. They can directly forcefully manipulate the spiritual energy around, creating a state of spiritual vacuum. In the absence of spiritual energy to nourish them, the spiritual entities will perish in an instant.</p><p></p><p>The other is to cultivate spiritual techniques, which can unleash spiritual attacks. These people are called exorcists, but due to the scarcity of spiritual techniques and the difficulty of cultivation, there are still not many of them even in a world revived with spiritual energy.</p><p></p><p>"Hasn't the owner of the house found someone to perform an exorcism?"</p><p></p><p>The customer manager sighed helplessly.</p><p></p><p>"How could they not have? They've called in many exorcists, and they all went in and didn't find any ghosts, and came out unharmed. But as soon as a tenant moves in, they get scared and say they've seen ghosts. They say you can even hear eerie laughter coming from the house at midnight.</p><p></p><p>And this is just an ordinary residential house, there hasn't even been any deaths. Finding a Grand Master to deal with this junk is not something the owner can afford, let alone that Grand Masters are not easy to find."</p><p></p><p>Ye Xiao fell silent for a moment. His cultivation technique could allow him to unleash attacks that surpass his own cultivation level, perhaps he could deal with that thing.</p><p></p><p>100 yuan a month, 1,200 a year, and he doesn't even live there regularly, only when he needs to cultivate his fusion technique, it's quite a bargain.</p><p></p><p>If the other party has any doubts, he can simply say that he hasn't encountered any ghosts, maybe they've left.</p><p></p><p>Perfect.</p><p></p><p>"I'll take it."</p><p></p><p>Ye Xiao took 1,200 yuan out of his pocket and slapped it on the table.</p><p></p><p>The customer manager was taken aback, then let out a bitter laugh: "Sir, why don't you just change to another one? Dying in there just to save a bit on rent is really not worth it."</p><p></p><p>Ye Xiao was so young, there's no way he should...</p><p></p><p>Here is the full English translation of the Chinese excerpt:</p><p></p><p>"Even if he is a master exorcist, his cultivation level cannot be too deep."</p><p></p><p>"No need, I've already rented this house."</p><p></p><p>"Then let me make it clear, if anything happens, we're not responsible."</p><p></p><p>"No problem."</p><p></p><p>The contract was quickly signed, and Ye Xiao took the keys and found the house according to the address.</p><p></p><p>Possibly due to the lack of occupants for a long time, the main gate had accumulated some dust and spider webs.</p><p></p><p>Ye Xiao opened the gate, and with a creaking sound, he entered the courtyard.</p><p></p><p>He released his spiritual energy, spreading it to every corner of the house, but found nothing.</p><p></p><p>He then proceeded to the main hall and began inspecting the rooms.</p><p></p><p>Just as he stepped into the main hall, the iron gate in the courtyard silently closed behind him.</p><p></p><p>Ye Xiao checked the first floor, and to his surprise, the furniture was relatively new.</p><p></p><p>However, in the corner of the sofa, he found a pure black, curvy hair, with no impurities.</p><p></p><p>It was a freshly fallen hair, not something that a spiritual being would have.</p><p></p><p>This made Ye Xiao slightly narrow his eyes.</p><p></p><p>He pretended not to have noticed and continued towards the second floor.</p><p></p><p>The second floor was equally clean, but there were more signs of habitation.</p><p></p><p>Just as he was about to enter the master bedroom, the lighting on the entire second floor suddenly dimmed, as if it had been obscured by something.</p><p></p><p>Gradually, fresh red blood began to appear on the walls, and some strange laughter started to reach Ye Xiao's ears.</p><p></p><p>Ye Xiao kept his hands behind his back, his expression calm and indifferent, not paying too much attention to these abnormal phenomena.</p><p></p><p>"Come out, hiding and sneaking around is not interesting."</p><p></p><p>Soon, a woman ghost in a blood-red long dress and with long hair appeared before him.</p><p></p><p>"What a bold move to come and rent this house. Don't you know there are ghosts in this house?"</p><p></p><p>"I know."</p><p></p><p>"You know, and you still dare to come? Are you an exorcist?"</p><p></p><p>Ye Xiao shook his head.</p><p></p><p>"Then are you a great master?"</p><p></p><p>Ye Xiao shook his head again.</p><p></p><p>"Hmph! You're not an exorcist, nor a great master, and you still dare to come here. You must be tired of living!"</p><p></p><p>Ye Xiao's expression remained indifferent, but his right hand slowly moved from behind his back and hung by his side.</p><p></p><p>"I'm not an exorcist, nor a great master, but I have a sword, and I'd like you to try it."</p><p></p><p>"Hahaha..."</p><p></p><p>The woman ghost let out a manic laugh, like the sound of a parched throat, sharp and grating.</p><p></p><p>"Do you think you can deal with me with just a sword? Who do you think you are? Well, since you've come to me, I can't be blamed.</p><p></p><p>I haven't tasted human blood for a long time."</p><p></p><p>As she spoke, a powerful aura suddenly erupted from her body, making her red dress swell up, appearing even more ominous and sinister as she slowly floated towards Ye Xiao.</p><p></p><p>Ye Xiao didn't waste any words, he simply raised his hand slightly, and an overwhelming, terrifying sword intent instantly enveloped the entire room.</p><p></p><p>This tyrannical sword intent seemed capable of slicing through anything, crushing everything within this space.</p><p></p><p>The once arrogant woman ghost, who was about to attack Ye Xiao, knelt on the ground as soon as she felt this sword intent, trembling in fear.</p><p></p><p>"Senior, please speak calmly. Brandishing swords and knives is uncivilized!"</p>

        <h1>Chapter 192</h1>
        <div class="content">
            <p>Here is the full English translation of the Chinese excerpt:</p><p></p><p>But this aura of oppression did not descend.</p><p></p><p>Because breaking through the spatial transmission formation had consumed too much of its energy, leaving it unable to continue advancing towards Ye Xiao.</p><p></p><p>However, even so, its residual might still blew out a gale, causing the flowing clouds to retreat.</p><p></p><p>The fierce qi on Ye Xiao's body surface swayed like flames.</p><p></p><p>"Roar—!"</p><p></p><p>Immediately after, an angry tiger's roar transmitted out from the spatial formation.</p><p></p><p>The furious roar, like thunderous claps, was deafening, echoing through the heavens and earth.</p><p></p><p>Ye Xiao could sense the rage, unwillingness, and strong killing intent from this tiger's roar.</p><p></p><p>But Ye Xiao not only did not feel the slightest bit of fear, he even had a hint of excitement.</p><p></p><p>What a powerful star beast! The strength of this star beast must have already surpassed the Xiantian Ninth-Grade experts.</p><p></p><p>Even a Xiantian Eighth-Grade star beast's vital energy is already extremely rich.</p><p></p><p>If it's a star beast that has surpassed the Xiantian Ninth-Grade, how powerful would its vital energy be? Just now, that divine lord star beast seemed to be calling the Tiger God!</p><p></p><p>Tiger God? </p><p></p><p>Could it be a tiger?</p><p></p><p>He didn't know how delicious tiger meat was, but tiger skin must be extremely precious, far more valuable than the Aer King's.</p><p></p><p>Besides that, tiger hide and bones would also be excellent tonics, perfect for making wine.</p><p></p><p>Refining dan with tiger bones also seems quite good.</p><p></p><p>Just thinking about it made Ye Xiao's mouth water.</p><p></p><p>At this time, the tiger's roar in the sky continued.</p><p></p><p>After a moment of silence, Ye Xiao raised his hand and slashed.</p><p></p><p>Boom—! This slash detonated within the spatial transmission passage, completely destroying the entire spatial transmission formation, the transmission gate closing completely.</p><p></p><p>"Now it's finally quiet.</p><p></p><p>However, I also need to quickly improve my strength. In the future, when I encounter this Tiger God, I can't let it go."</p><p></p><p>Ye Xiao glanced at the three Xiantian Eighth-Grade divine lord star beasts in his storage ring, a hint of satisfaction flashing in his eyes.</p><p></p><p>It seems the breeding ground can be expanded a bit.</p><p></p><p>He held Qin Yuyan and quickly returned to Jianghai City. After returning to Jianghai City, he used his healing art to repair Qin Yuyan's injuries, placed her at the entrance of the City Lord's Mansion, and then began to busy himself with his own matters.</p><p></p><p>Qin Yuyan woke from her daze and saw the City Lord's Mansion, startled.</p><p></p><p>"I remember I should have been taken into the spatial transmission formation by that Xiantian Eighth-Grade divine lord star beast. How did I end up in front of the City Lord's Mansion?</p><p></p><p>Could it be that I've already died? Is this just a fantasy after my death?"</p><p></p><p>However, she soon pinched her own cheek, the pain telling her that she had not died.</p><p></p><p>"Strange, how did I end up here?"</p><p></p><p>She pondered for a moment.</p><p></p><p>"I remember, at that time my consciousness was about to disappear, then I heard the sound of battle, and after that... Could it be that Senior Sword Immortal saved me?"</p><p></p><p>In the entire Jianghai City, the only one with the strength to rescue her was him.</p><p></p><p>And there was one more point - only Senior Sword Immortal possessed such powerful healing arts, able to repair her severe injuries in such a short time.</p><p></p><p>"Senior, you've made me indebted to you again! But why didn't you let me know who you really are?"</p><p></p><p>A faint sigh escaped Qin Yuyan, her helplessness evident.</p><p></p><p>Time passed second by second, the endless darkness causing the Iron Ox, Ink Jade, and Su Shan, the three divine lord star beasts, to drift aimlessly like floating duckweed, unaware of their location.</p><p></p><p>Suddenly, a beam of light appeared, as if possessing great attraction, guiding the consciousness of the three divine lord star beasts back to reality.</p><p></p><p>Finally, they passed through an extremely dazzling light gate, their consciousness fully awakening.</p><p></p><p>"Strange, weren't we already dead? How are we alive again?"</p><p></p><p>"I don't know, could this be the underworld? Is that why our souls have gathered together?"</p><p></p><p>"No, this isn't the underworld, you two... look."</p><p></p><p>Ink Jade pointed ahead, and Iron Ox and Su Shan followed her gaze, their spirits immediately shaking, their entire bodies trembling uncontrollably.</p><p></p><p>Not far from them stood a figure that filled them with immense fear, a man like a nightmare - Ye Xiao!</p><p></p><p>"Run!"</p><p></p><p>Iron Ox and Su Shan immediately wanted to flee.</p><p></p><p>In fact, aside from running, they really couldn't think of anything else to do.</p><p></p><p>Unfortunately, although the two star beasts were fast, they were far from as quick as Ye Xiao.</p><p></p><p>The moment the two star beasts turned to run, Ye Xiao snapped his fingers, unleashing two Infinite Calamity Fingers.</p><p></p><p>Instantly piercing the knee joints of the two star beasts.</p><p></p><p>Bang! Bang! The sounds of bone fracturing echoed out, causing Iron Ox and Su Shan to shudder and become obedient.</p><p></p><p>"What's going on? Didn't you already kill us? Why did you revive us?"</p><p></p><p>Ye Xiao replied indifferently:</p><p></p><p>"Someone will tell you soon."</p><p></p><p>With that, Ye Xiao directly used spiritual energy to restrain the three star beasts and brought them underground.</p><p></p><p>Here is the full English translation of the Chinese excerpt:</p><p></p><p>In fact, Ye Xiao had already taken the initiative to detect their star cores and obtained their imperial arts from within.</p><p></p><p>Among them, the imperial art in the Iron Ox's star core was of the same origin as his own cultivation of the Indestructible Divine Skill, so it was not recorded in his Golden Book Spiritual Consciousness.</p><p></p><p>Moyu's healing art was the same.</p><p></p><p>Now, he had already collected three different types of imperial-level healing arts, so it was impossible to continue recording them.</p><p></p><p>Susan was a little stronger than the other two, and there were two imperial arts within her star core.</p><p></p><p>One of them was a body technique, but unfortunately, it was similar to the Divine Will Incantation, so it could not be recorded.</p><p></p><p>Fortunately, Susan's other imperial art - the Supreme Sword Technique - was a different sword art from the Heavenly Slash, so it could be directly recorded into the Golden Book Spiritual Consciousness.</p><p></p><p>In this way, he now possessed two imperial-level sword arts.</p><p></p><p>There was no need to be too disappointed.</p><p></p><p>Originally, imperial arts and ordinary cultivation methods were the same, all having certain principles and foundations. Only those that were different could be fused together to enhance each other's strength and make up for each other's shortcomings.</p><p></p><p>For Ye Xiao to obtain an imperial-level sword art from among the three-headed innate eighth-rank spirit beast stars was already a great gain.</p><p></p><p>At least the chances were higher than just searching for those basic cultivation methods in the library.</p><p></p><p>After scanning the star cores of a few spirit beasts, the remaining ones were arranged in the breeding grounds.</p><p></p><p>Moyu was a cow, and even a female cow, so he could milk her, and finally, there would be milk to drink.</p><p></p><p>Moreover, since her bloodline was proficient in the healing system, the milk would also contain some components that could heal injuries. Drinking a lot of it would definitely benefit the body and enhance his cultivation.</p><p></p><p>This fellow must be kept.</p><p></p><p>As for Iron Ox, it was not as useful.</p><p></p><p>Its true body was actually just a rhinoceros beetle.</p><p></p><p>Its shell was thick and incredibly powerful! </p><p></p><p>The meat was definitely not edible, and Ye Xiao didn't have the heart to eat it.</p><p></p><p>However, it also had its unique uses. That is, its shell was extremely hard.</p><p></p><p>After cultivating for so many years, its shell had already reached a state of mastery. It might even be harder than a turtle's shell.</p><p></p><p>Such a hard shell, Ye Xiao did not want to waste it.</p><p></p><p>He could peel off the shell each time and use it to refine armor.</p><p></p><p>Or, use its shell to enhance his current armor.</p><p></p><p>Even before being refined, its shell could withstand the attacks of a sword saint like Liu Chengxun. If he refined it and extracted the elements into his own armor, his armor would be able to be further enhanced.</p><p></p><p>Such a good spirit beast must be kept as well.</p><p></p><p>As for the remaining one, Susan, she was truly Ye Xiao's biggest surprise so far.</p><p></p><p>She was a bee!</p><p></p><p>A bee! Not only did she provide him with the imperial-level Supreme Sword Technique, but she could also continuously provide him with honey.</p><p></p><p>This was much better than the meat of spirit beasts, right?</p><p></p><p>It had both blood energy and spiritual energy, and the taste was also very good.</p><p></p><p>After obtaining her and Moyu, Ye Xiao felt like he had suddenly gone from the primitive life of eating raw meat to modern society.</p><p></p><p>Eating the meat of spirit beasts, no matter how delicious, would eventually become monotonous!</p><p></p><p>But with milk and honey, he could make many delicious things and change the flavors.</p><p></p><p>In the sealed area below, Noel Fis and other spirit beasts were playing some small games to pass the time.</p><p></p><p>"This life is really too boring. I wonder when it will end."</p><p></p><p>"Can't be helped, our strength is too weak, we can't even beat that freak Ye Xiao!"</p><p></p><p>"Just endure it, for us spirit beasts, two thousand five hundred years is just a fleeting moment."</p><p></p><p>"Hopefully, in four years, when the beast calamity comes, some strong cultivators will discover our existence and rescue us."</p><p></p><p>As soon as the words were spoken, a familiar aura suddenly permeated the area.</p><p></p><p>The seven spirit beasts immediately changed expression.</p><p></p><p>"Damn it! He's here again!"</p><p></p><p>"We're done for. He said he wouldn't come here often, only letting that eunuch cat come. Since he's here, it must be for no good reason."</p><p></p><p>"Damn it, is he about to break through and wants to use us to refine pills?"</p><p></p><p>"That's not the scariest part, the scariest part is, what if he wants one of us to help him cultivate?"</p><p></p><p>The group suddenly shuddered and instinctively huddled closer to the walls, trying to protect certain areas.</p><p></p><p>The next moment, Ye Xiao's figure appeared in their sight.</p><p></p><p>All the spirit beasts were terrified to the extreme, clinging tightly to the walls, wishing they could tear Ye Xiao to shreds and devour him alive, but at this moment, they could only pretend to be cowardly.</p>

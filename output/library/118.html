        <h1>Chapter 118</h1>
        <div class="content">
            <p>Here is the full English translation of the Chinese excerpt:</p><p></p><p>"Where's the snake meat from our place?"</p><p></p><p>"Ah, where's the snake meat from our place?"</p><p></p><p>Huan Liuli was rushing around the entire cellar, looking at the completely empty cellar, not even a single piece of meat left, and the whole cat was in disarray.</p><p></p><p>She just said that previously, how did Ye Xiao suddenly break through? It must be that he refined the entire black-scaled snake into a dan! "Damn it, Ye Xiao, couldn't you have left a bit for our place?"</p><p></p><p>Huan Liuli was so angry she was coughing up blood, her small fists clenched tightly, making creaking sounds.</p><p></p><p>Without the black-scaled snake meat, how could she improve her own strength? When would she be able to break through her current cultivation?</p><p></p><p>Five hundred years later, how could she make Ye Xiao her personal pet? Damn it!</p><p></p><p>Damn it!</p><p></p><p>"Ye Xiao, you are so ruthless in your actions, just wait for our place to rise up and become the master. On that day, I will definitely step on you, never wash my feet, and make you lick my toes!"</p><p></p><p>Upstairs, Ye Xiao's impatient voice came through.</p><p></p><p>"Can you be quieter while working down there? What are you yelling about?"</p><p></p><p>Huan Liuli shuddered and quickly responded in a coquettish voice:</p><p></p><p>"Master, please calm down, our place will be more quiet."</p><p></p><p>After saying this, she wiped the cold sweat from her forehead.</p><p></p><p>There's no help for it, Ye Xiao is too strong now, she is not his match yet, she can only endure for the time being and keep a low profile.</p><p></p><p>It is rumored that in the past of the human race, there was King Fuchai of Wu who endured hardship and tasted bitterness. Today, there is Huan Liuli, who will endure humiliation and act as a slave!</p><p></p><p>...</p><p></p><p>On the other side, at the auction, that storage ring had also completely fallen, and was finally won by a local wealthy person from Jianghai City for 310 million.</p><p></p><p>In the hotel across from the auction house, two thin and tall figures watched as the people were leaving the Dongfeng Auction House, and the corners of their mouths curled up slightly.</p><p></p><p>"The mission is complete!"</p><p></p><p>"The people of the Nine Realms think they are clever, thinking that by sending experts from all over to patrol and eliminate all the star beasts, half-beasts, and ghosts before the Seven Stars Convergence, they can prevent us from invading the human race."</p><p></p><p>"Unfortunately, they cannot stop the wisdom of the Holy Envoy.</p><p></p><p>Using the spatial storage ring to hide the transmission star array, when the Seven Stars Convergence begins, we can transport the star beasts in large numbers into the city."</p><p></p><p>"This time, it will make the human race on this planet pay an indelible price!"</p><p></p><p>The two figures looked at each other and smiled, their pupils revealing inhuman vertical pupils.</p><p></p><p>"The Holy Envoy said that more than fifty years ago, when the human race opened the star defense line, there was a young phantom cat that followed the beast herd to the human world, and its last location was in Jianghai City.</p><p></p><p>This time, you and I must find her.</p><p></p><p>A dragon-level bloodline star beast, its development potential cannot be underestimated. In the future, it will be a great help for us to fight against the human race."</p><p></p><p>"However, that being said, she has been separated from the star beasts for more than fifty years. If she has been living with humans, fifty years is enough time for her to change her thinking. If she is close to humans and unwilling to cooperate with us, what should we do?"</p><p></p><p>The other figure's eyes flashed with ruthlessness.</p><p></p><p>"That would be even better. You and I, our bloodlines are almost completely transformed into star beasts. If we have a dragon-level bloodline star beast, it will be enough to completely transform the remaining human blood in our bodies into star beast blood.</p><p></p><p>If she dares to side with the humans, we'll just eat her!"</p><p></p><p>Over the next more than a month, Jianghai City remained calm.</p><p></p><p>There were no star beasts, and no particularly special events.</p><p></p><p>Except that the warriors on the streets started wearing weapons, appearing a bit more serious, everything else was normal.</p><p></p><p>But for some reason, Ye Xiao always had a bad premonition. This was not because of his cultivation...</p><p></p><p>Here is the full English translation of the Chinese excerpt:</p><p></p><p>After refining the Taixuan Tiangong, when his cultivation reached the peak of the Xiantian Sixth Grade Grand Grandmaster realm, he seemed to have developed a kind of biological perception.</p><p></p><p>It is known that ants, insects, and sparrows and other small animals can sense impending natural disasters in advance and then flee to safe places. His cultivation has reached the Xiantian Sixth Grade, which is already very powerful, and his perception range is naturally much stronger than that of small insects and animals.</p><p></p><p>So he would not feel that this kind of sensation is vague and illusory.</p><p></p><p>However, he did not understand what this actually represented.</p><p></p><p>According to common sense, Elder Fa Zheng had already cleared all the star beasts in the Jianghai City, and he had scanned it several times with the Taixuan Tiangong and confirmed this matter.</p><p></p><p>The only threat to the entire Jianghai City might be Aier Wang.</p><p></p><p>But given Aier Wang's strength, he should not pose too much of a threat to the entire Jianghai City.</p><p></p><p>What was his sixth sense worrying about?</p><p></p><p>After thinking it over and over, Ye Xiao could not figure it out, and could only try to improve his own strength as much as possible, lest he be unable to face the impending disaster.</p><p></p><p>He then focused on studying books on star formations, and learned five basic categories of star formations, imprinting them on his divine soul.</p><p></p><p>Synthesizing them in the short term might be a bit difficult.</p><p></p><p>However, this was enough for him to engrave some basic star formations on his storage ring.</p><p></p><p>Such as defensive star formations, locking formations, and other categories of star formations, and even attach a trace of spiritual power to the ring to prevent it from being lost and found.</p><p></p><p>These basic star formations were certainly not worthy of such a good spatial storage ring, but the storage ring could only be used when he left it, and as long as he did not leave it, he had the Taixuan Tiangong to shield it, so no one could see its secrets!</p><p></p><p>The rest would be easy to arrange imperial-level star formations once he synthesized imperial-level star formation deployment methods.</p><p></p><p>That day, Ye Xiao was reading a book when his phone suddenly lit up.</p><p></p><p>It was a call from Gu Hai.</p><p></p><p>"Hello?"</p><p></p><p>As soon as Ye Xiao answered the phone, Gu Hai's anxious voice came from the other end.</p><p></p><p>"Hey, Ye, are you there? Do you have time now?"</p><p></p><p>"It's fine, nothing major. What's up?"</p><p></p><p>"Just now, my parents called me and said that Shuang'er has a stomachache and has been sent to the hospital. But I'm out on a mission, there's a group of children from the Three Attached Organization going on a field trip, and I encountered a star beast, so I can't leave the children and go back.</p><p></p><p>If you're free, could you go take a look? My parents are old, and I'm worried they won't be able to handle it properly."</p><p></p><p>"Okay, I'll go take a look."</p><p></p><p>"Ye, thank you. I'll treat you to a meal when I get back."</p><p></p><p>"No need to be so polite. Just focus on your mission."</p><p></p><p>"Alright, I'll hang up now."</p><p></p><p>"Be careful."</p><p></p><p>Ye Xiao hung up the phone, closed the book, and headed to the hospital.</p><p></p><p>The two were good friends, and moreover, Gu Hai was busy safeguarding the security of Jianghai City every day. If Ye Xiao couldn't even help with this small favor, it would be rather heartless of him.</p><p></p><p>However, this also made Ye Xiao a bit puzzled. Could it be that his bad premonition was pointing to this matter?</p><p></p><p>After all, from a certain perspective, Gu Hai was his good brother, part of his circle of family and friends.</p><p></p><p>Was it because of the danger to his family members that he had this premonition?</p><p></p><p>(End of chapter)</p>

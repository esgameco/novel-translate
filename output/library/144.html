        <h1>Chapter 144</h1>
        <div class="content">
            <p>Here is the full English translation of the Chinese excerpt:</p><p></p><p>Although using force, the powerful magnetic field effect of Emperor Zong would make the cameras unable to function, but moving too quickly would also draw others' attention.</p><p></p><p>After packing everything up, Ye Xiao collected a number of books in his storage ring to continue reading at home later.</p><p></p><p>He would return them early tomorrow morning.</p><p></p><p>Since obtaining the storage ring, Ye Xiao found that it had indeed made things much more convenient for him.</p><p></p><p>As he was about to leave the library, a terrifying bloodthirsty aura suddenly erupted from under the Sword Immortal statue at the library entrance.</p><p></p><p>Ye Xiao was startled, and saw a giant tentacle, comparable to a huge black-scaled snake, rapidly emerging from the ground beneath the statue.</p><p></p><p>"Hahaha, I, the Venerable One, have finally emerged! I have emerged! </p><p></p><p>Shaolin, wait to bear the wrath of I, the Venerable One! After being suppressed for over 300 years, I will repay you with the fresh blood of all Shaolin disciples.</p><p></p><p>And this Jianghai City, I will make the rivers run red with blood, and turn all the humans of Jianghai City into nourishment for me to regain my strength!"</p><p></p><p>The moment the words fell, the tentacle sensed Ye Xiao.</p><p></p><p>"The snack has delivered itself, perfect. I, the Venerable One, haven't tasted human flesh in over 300 years, so I'll use you to whet my appetite!"</p><p></p><p>The massive tentacle viciously lashed out towards Ye Xiao, its suction cups like gaping mouths trying to drain Ye Xiao dry.</p><p></p><p>But just as the tentacle was about to reach Ye Xiao, a shocking sword beam, like an ultra-high-powered laser cannon, shot up into the sky, instantly severing the tentacle.</p><p></p><p>Noel Fis: "(?ω?`)!"</p><p></p><p>What is this situation? A seemingly young human youth just severed his tentacle with a single move? Although his manifestation here in Jianghai City is only a fragment, and not his full form, he still has the cultivation of an Emperor Zong. An Emperor Zong! Not just a Patriarch! </p><p></p><p>This powerful cultivation would be enough to make any human tremble in fear anywhere.</p><p></p><p>Yet he was cut down by the other's sword beam just like that?</p><p></p><p>Is the other also a cultivator above Emperor Zong? Before he could react, the next moment, Ye Xiao suddenly extended a large hand, and the spiritual energy in the air rapidly formed a Heaven-Crushing Earth-Shattering Grand Formation, directly imprinting it on the Gathering Spirit Formation.</p><p></p><p>Boom! In an instant, most of Noel Fis' manifestation was suppressed again, leaving only a long tentacle and a large hole on the ground, everything else eerily quiet, as if nothing had happened.</p><p></p><p>Noel Fis: "(灬`)!"</p><p></p><p>He is now in a completely dumbfounded state.</p><p></p><p>He has been sealed again?</p><p></p><p>And the aura of this formation is so powerful, it's even an Imperial Formation?</p><p></p><p>He was severely injured by a single sword strike from this extremely young human Emperor Zong, and then sealed by the other with an Imperial Formation! "Fuck!"</p><p></p><p>"Fuck! Fuck! Fuck!"</p><p></p><p>He has encountered a terrifyingly monstrous and extraordinary human expert! It's all over, it's all over.</p><p></p><p>He had originally thought that by sending a manifestation to a small place like Jianghai City, he might have a chance to escape.</p><p></p><p>But unexpectedly, he has encountered an even more terrifying existence.</p><p></p><p>Now he'll never be able to escape, unless his main body in Shaolin manages to break free and come rescue him.</p><p></p><p>No! </p><p></p><p>No, no, no!</p><p></p><p>His main body must not come, absolutely cannot come. This person is so powerful, so monstrous, so demonic, if the main body comes and gets killed, he won't even have the chance to cry.</p><p></p><p>It seems he can only try to save himself now. </p><p></p><p>Although this person is formidable, he can't guarantee he'll be here all the time.</p><p></p><p>He'll first secretly cultivate and raise his own strength, then when he's powerful enough, he'll try to break through this formation and reunite with the main body.</p><p></p><p>Decided, he'll cultivate for 500 years first!</p><p></p><p>In 500 years, he'll break this formation and reunite with the main body!</p><p></p><p>As for Ye Xiao, after sealing Noel Fis, he happily collected Noel Fis' tentacle into his storage ring.</p><p></p><p>Unexpectedly, he got the coveted octopus tentacle on his way home from work today. </p><p></p><p>Judging from the size, he should be able to make quite a few delicious dishes - octopus stir-fry, octopus balls, grilled octopus with onions, it's going to be amazing.</p><p></p><p>At this moment, a few powerful auras rapidly approached from the distance. Ye Xiao's mind stirred, and he immediately used the Divine Thought Technique to leave the area.</p><p></p><p>Soon, Fa Zheng, Du Changfeng, and several other Patriarchs quickly arrived at the scene.</p><p></p><p>"What just happened? What occurred here? That sword beam, it seemed so similar to Senior Sword Immortal's..."</p><p></p><p>Fa Zheng descended to the ground, looking extremely grave as he examined the large hole.</p><p></p><p>However, after his inspection, his expression suddenly changed drastically.</p><p></p><p>"Fa Zheng Master, what's going on?" Du Changfeng asked anxiously.</p><p></p><p>Fa Zheng spoke grimly, "The sealing formation in the Gathering Spirit Formation has been broken."</p><p></p><p>Du Changfeng's pupils constricted.</p><p></p><p>"Does that mean Noel Fis has escaped?"</p><p></p><p>Fa Zheng shook his head.</p><p></p><p>"He has not escaped, because now, an Imperial-level sealing star formation has been added on top of the Gathering Spirit Formation!"</p><p></p><p>"What did you say!" </p><p></p><p>Hearing this, everyone present couldn't help but have their hair stand on end.</p><p></p><p>Here is the full English translation of the Chinese excerpt:</p><p></p><p>The Imperial Stair Sealing Star Formation? </p><p></p><p>Good heavens, this is just too crazy! </p><p></p><p>How powerful of a formation master must one be to accomplish this? Fa Zheng spoke again:</p><p></p><p>"If I'm not mistaken, the situation should be as follows. </p><p></p><p>Just now, Noel Fiss nearly escaped from underground, but was discovered by Senior Sword Immortal and severely injured, who then also used the Imperial Formation to re-seal him."</p><p></p><p>Everyone fell silent, the air sinking into a deathly stillness. </p><p></p><p>Unanimously, they cast astonished and reverent gazes towards the statue of the Sword Immortal.</p><p></p><p>Just how powerful is Senior Sword Immortal?</p><p></p><p>Possessing Godking-level cultivation, mastering both the Dao of the Sword and the Dao of the Knife, and Imperial-level healing arts.</p><p></p><p>And now, he also commands an Imperial Formation! The crowd has run out of words to describe him.</p><p></p><p>At this moment, he is becoming deified in their hearts.</p><p></p><p>Fa Zheng too lifted his head, intently staring at the statue of the Sword Immortal, filled with deep curiosity towards this Sword Immortal he has never met.</p><p></p><p>It is said that the Sword Saint of Hanzhou and the Godking Knife Cultivator of Yingzhou are both coming to challenge the Sword Immortal. </p><p></p><p>Previously, they had to guard their own countries due to the Seven Stars Convergence, but now that it has been settled, they should be arriving soon.</p><p></p><p>I wonder if Senior Sword Immortal will come out to meet them?</p><p></p><p>I truly hope I can witness an unparalleled, epoch-making great battle.</p><p></p><p>As for Ye Xiao, after returning home, he immediately took out Noel Fiss' tentacles and filled the entire courtyard with them. </p><p></p><p>Some areas in the storage ring were already deformed due to the lack of space.</p><p></p><p>Ye Xiao felt that he needed to buy some more obsidian to properly expand the space in the storage ring.</p><p></p><p>Otherwise, it would soon be insufficient.</p><p></p><p>These powerful star beasts are so massive that a single tentacle can occupy the entire storage space.</p><p></p><p>If he encounters the whole body, he can only watch helplessly, anxious.</p><p></p><p>The Illusory Jade Glass in the room, sensing this scent, immediately rushed out of the house like a madman.</p><p></p><p>Cats are inherently unable to resist the smell of fish.</p><p></p><p>As the old saying goes, there is no cat in this world that does not steal fish.</p><p></p><p>If it doesn't steal fish, it's not a cat.</p><p></p><p>"Wow, what a huge octopus! I'll have a delicious meal tonight!"</p><p></p><p>Ye Xiao tossed a stack of red bills to the Illusory Jade Glass.</p><p></p><p>"I'll take care of this tentacle, you go get some oil and onions. Remember to pay for them."</p><p></p><p>"Don't worry, I'll be right back."</p><p></p><p>The Illusory Jade Glass took the money and rushed out towards the nearby supermarket.</p><p></p><p>Ye Xiao then began processing the tentacle. </p><p></p><p>First, he removed the suction cups, which had sharp teeth inside and were inedible.</p><p></p><p>After processing, only the fresh flesh of Noel Fiss' squid remained.</p><p></p><p>Squid meat is very chewy and has a great bite. After being cooked, it becomes fragrant, and when chewed in the mouth, the oil bursts out, making it irresistible.</p><p></p><p>It also has the inherent fresh and delicious taste of seafood, which is simply YYDS (Extremely Awesome).</p><p></p><p>Meanwhile, in the secret mountain forest of Chu State, several beams of light silently arrived, illuminating a small patch of forest.</p><p></p><p>Each beam of light was a different color, but their auras were all extremely terrifying, not weaker than Godking-level experts.</p><p></p><p>As the light faded, several figures emerged.</p><p></p><p>Some were burly and muscular, some were delicate and charming, some were old, and some had the appearance of children.</p><p></p><p>But each figure had some other strange features to varying degrees.</p><p></p><p>Some had bizarre pupils, some had tails, some had scales, and some even had feather coats that seemed to be a part of their bodies.</p><p></p><p>These powerful beings were all Star Beasts!</p><p></p><p>"After decades, we finally meet again, my fellow companions."</p><p></p><p>"It seems that over these decades, we have all been tormented by the human race, and not a single one of us is intact and unharmed."</p><p></p><p>"Hmph! The human race is despicable and shameless, relying on numerical superiority. If it were a one-on-one fight, we might not necessarily lose to the human race."</p><p></p><p>"Being able to find the humans is also a skill. At the end of the day, our strength is still too weak. If the Beast Deities descend, the human race will be destroyed in the blink of an eye."</p><p></p><p>"According to the plans of those Beast Deities, this calamity of the Star Beasts will allow them to rush over and completely destroy the human race in this world.</p><p></p><p>Now, we must create some crises for the human race before the Beast Calamity erupts, to weaken their strength."</p><p></p><p>"Our breakthrough from the Seven Stars Convergence also cost us many casualties. It's not very likely that we can counterattack the humans immediately. </p><p></p><p>However, we can first find some helpers to enhance our cultivation.</p><p></p><p>I've heard that the human race has started building large cities in search of Holy Sons and Holy Daughters, and many more powerful Godking-level Star Beasts have been assigned to other cities as the core of their Spiritual Gathering Formations.</p><p></p><p>And in Jianghai City, there is a manifestation of the Senior Noel Fiss!"</p>

        <h1>Chapter 84</h1>
        <div class="content">
            <p>Here is the full English translation of the Chinese excerpt:</p><p></p><p>Over the next few days, Ye Xiao accompanied the venerable Dharma Master Fa Zheng, wandering aimlessly around the city of Jianghai.</p><p></p><p>Although Jianghai City also had a garrison, the garrison were ultimately a group of post-celestial martial artists, not even reaching the celestial realm, and it was difficult to find those stronger star beasts.</p><p></p><p>But these escaped fish, after encountering the old monk, were all killed, not a single one escaped.</p><p></p><p>Especially in the evenings.</p><p></p><p>Perhaps these hidden star beasts, or semi-beasts, ghosts and resentful spirits, would be more likely to come out at night.</p><p></p><p>Fa Zheng continuously exterminated two or three dozen, including star beasts and resentful spirits, and they were all post-celestial fifth-grade or above in strength.</p><p></p><p>In this way, the entire Jianghai City was almost completely purged by Fa Zheng.</p><p></p><p>And as Fa Zheng killed more and more star beasts, Ye Xiao noticed that the demonic thoughts within him were becoming increasingly heavy.</p><p></p><p>Even the serenity in his gaze occasionally revealed a trace of weak killing intent.</p><p></p><p>According to common sense, Fa Zheng, a grand master, his state of mind could not be said to be shallow, and it was absolutely impossible for him to be disturbed in his state of mind just because he had killed a few dozen star beasts.</p><p></p><p>There must be some hidden secrets here.</p><p></p><p>On the fourth night, Ye Xiao brought the Dharma Master Fa Zheng to the suburbs and eliminated another post-celestial seventh-grade star beast. By this time, Fa Zheng's complexion had become much paler.</p><p></p><p>Ye Xiao felt that if this continued, Fa Zheng might go mad, so he found a nearby inn and let him rest for the night.</p><p></p><p>Upon entering the lobby, the doorkeeper was a young girl with smoky makeup and tattoos on her body. Although it was already autumn, it was a bit stuffy tonight, and she was licking an ice cream to cool down, her skills no less than those of a famous film director.</p><p></p><p>"How much for an overnight stay?"</p><p></p><p>The other party glanced at the two of them and said casually, "Eight hundred for one, sixteen hundred for two, no room fee."</p><p></p><p>Ye Xiao: "(!)"</p><p></p><p>Fa Zheng was a bit puzzled.</p><p></p><p>"Disciple Ye, what does she mean?"</p><p></p><p>"Well, this is a kind of service in their store, intended to challenge the spiritual weaknesses of the guests."</p><p></p><p>Ye Xiao tried to explain it in a way that the old monk could understand.</p><p></p><p>Dharma Master Fa Zheng was greatly surprised.</p><p></p><p>"How amazing! </p><p>I didn't expect this place to have such wonderful things, able to set up spiritual barriers for martial artists. If one can break through, it must surely lead to an improvement in one's state of mind.</p><p>Indeed, the masters are among the common people!</p><p>This poor monk has cultivated for half a century, and has also practiced many Shaolin spiritual Buddhist techniques, may I try it as well?"</p><p></p><p>Ye Xiao: "(⊙⊙)!"</p><p></p><p>He was not sure whether Fa Zheng had really understood, or not understood at all.</p><p>Nor did he know if Fa Zheng was pretending to be confused or truly confused. True and false, false and true.</p><p>If he exposed it, it wouldn't be too good either.</p><p></p><p>Therefore, after taking a deep breath, Ye Xiao said in a serious tone:</p><p></p><p>"Let me consult about this."</p><p></p><p>He turned to look at the receptionist lady, and spoke again:</p><p></p><p>"Can you issue an invoice?"</p><p></p><p>She nodded, causing her two papaya-like breasts to sway, captivating the senses.</p><p></p><p>"Yes, we can. Do you want the invoice for sixteen hundred or three thousand? If it's three thousand, there's an extra hundred. We can't go any higher than that, after all, you two are staying at our inn, it wouldn't be appropriate to charge too much. If your company finds out, the market supervision and the garrison might come after us as well."</p><p></p><p>After a moment of silence, Ye Xiao handed over his bank card.</p><p></p><p>"Issue the invoice for three thousand, two rooms, one is a regular single bed room for me."</p><p></p><p>"Okay."</p><p></p><p>She quickly printed out the invoice and gave Ye Xiao two room keys.</p><p></p><p>"For the regular single bed room, there's only one single bed. The other one is a double bed, you can take the double bed, and leave the single bed for your friend, the experience will be better that way."</p><p></p><p>"Mm-hmm!"</p><p></p><p>Ye Xiao took the room keys and led Fa Zheng upstairs, each entering their respective rooms.</p><p></p><p>After washing up, Ye Xiao lay on the bed and continued studying the cultivation techniques. But before long, his doorbell rang.</p><p></p><p>Here is the full English translation of the Chinese excerpt:</p><p></p><p>Ye Xiao's spirits were suddenly lifted, and it turned out to be Fa Zheng.</p><p></p><p>He opened the door, and Fa Zheng, the old monk, was standing at his door with a slightly flushed face, like a child who had made a mistake, a bit at a loss.</p><p></p><p>"Patron Ye, may this poor monk stay in your room for one night? That woman came in and immediately took off her clothes, saying something about having professional ethics, having taken the money, and must do the job, and absolutely refused to leave."</p><p></p><p>Ye Xiao was stunned, feeling that the old monk was not pretending, but truly pure.</p><p></p><p>Just now, he really didn't understand the meaning of his own words.</p><p></p><p>"Come in."</p><p></p><p>He didn't really mind, after all, his side was a double bed, and they wouldn't be sleeping on the same bed.</p><p></p><p>"Thank you."</p><p></p><p>Fa Zheng, as if he had grasped a lifesaver, quickly entered Ye Xiao's room.</p><p></p><p>After coming in, he let out a long sigh, said "Amitabha", and his complexion gradually returned to normal.</p><p></p><p>"Forgive me for making Patron Ye laugh."</p><p></p><p>Ye Xiao shook his head.</p><p></p><p>"It was my fault for not explaining clearly."</p><p></p><p>"No, Patron Ye hinted subtly, but this poor monk was dull-witted and didn't understand it at first, resulting in a joke."</p><p></p><p>After a pause, he saw the books on Ye Xiao's bedside and couldn't help but exclaim in surprise, "Ah, this is... a cultivation technique?"</p><p></p><p>Ye Xiao nodded.</p><p></p><p>"I didn't expect Patron Ye to be so diligent and studious, studying the art of body cultivation even late at night. If you can awaken your spiritual consciousness, your future will be limitless.</p><p></p><p>These past few days, I've observed that Patron Ye's temperament is excellent, very suitable for cultivating the Buddhist dharma. Perhaps, our meeting is destined by fate.</p><p></p><p>Why don't you join the Shaolin Martial Arts Academy? This poor monk can even try to get you a Condensing Spirit Elixir. It can refine your spiritual consciousness."</p><p></p><p>The Condensing Spirit Elixir is the only elixir that can refine the spiritual consciousness, but its materials require the souls of high-level spirit beasts, which are extremely rare and valuable, usually only available in major academies and on the frontlines.</p><p></p><p>Precious beyond measure.</p><p></p><p>But Ye Xiao shook his head.</p><p></p><p>"Thank you, Master, for your kind offer, but I'm used to staying in Jianghai City and don't want to leave for now."</p><p></p><p>Fa Zheng sighed lightly, a bit disappointed.</p><p></p><p>"Alright, that's a pity. But if Patron Ye ever changes your mind, you can always come to Shaolin to find me."</p><p></p><p>Ye Xiao nodded and continued reading his book.</p><p></p><p>As for the old monk Fa Zheng, he sat cross-legged in meditation, reciting the Buddhist scriptures.</p><p></p><p>Accompanying his chanting of the Buddhist teachings, a golden light shone on his body, dispelling the malicious aura around him.</p><p></p><p>In the small guestroom, Ye Xiao lay on his side reading, Fa Zheng sat in meditation, the bedside lamp casting a warm glow, a peaceful scene.</p><p></p><p>This scene lasted for about two hours.</p><p></p><p>After two hours, in the late night, a dark cloud covered the moonlight.</p><p></p><p>Outside the inn, a cold wind suddenly arose. Ye Xiao raised his eyebrows slightly, but did not look outside, instead watching the meditating Fa Zheng.</p><p></p><p>The wind outside was influenced by the surrounding yin magnetic field, and this magnetic field change actually originated from Fa Zheng's body.</p><p></p><p>At this time, the Buddhist light on his body began to flicker on and off, and another gloomy aura occasionally leaked out.</p>

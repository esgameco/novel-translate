        <h1>Chapter 173</h1>
        <div class="content">
            <p>Here is the full English translation of the Chinese excerpt:</p><p></p><p>Pu Jiansheng asked with some confusion, "Teacher, are you also of the Nine States bloodline?"</p><p></p><p>Liu Chengxun looked out the window and replied with a faint smile, "I am indeed of the Nine States bloodline. My ancestors were from the people of Jianghai City."</p><p></p><p>Pu Jiansheng was shocked, "(⊙.⊙)! Master, you are also of the Nine States bloodline? Heavens, no wonder I've always felt an extremely familiar connection with you. So that's how it is." </p><p></p><p>In this moment, Pu Jiansheng inexplicably felt an even deeper kinship and closeness with his master, stemming from a sense of belonging to the same ancestral bloodline.</p><p></p><p>On Ye Xiao's side, he had been at work for two days, but the incident between him, Liu Chengxun, and Nakamura Hitoshi had not died down. The news was still all over the internet. His colleagues at the library would discuss it whenever they had a free moment, much to Ye Xiao's exasperation and helplessness. </p><p></p><p>After all, for Ye Xiao, this was really not a big deal at all. Being undefeatable at the same level had become commonplace for him, ever since the days when he was a Patriarch. While others could only slash out a hundred or two hundred meters, he could do seven hundred meters with a single strike. But for these ordinary people, this was an earth-shattering, shocking event, as the Sage Monarch was virtually on par with Realm Sovereign experts in their eyes. And Ye Xiao had defeated two Sage Monarchs!</p><p></p><p>These past two days, Ye Xiao had been researching ancient texts and maps, trying to compare them to the map left behind by Fa Xin. He couldn't help but mock Fa Xin's poor drawing skills. Many places were just roughly outlined with straight lines, not the winding, detailed depictions of real world maps. Worse yet, Fa Xin was practically semi-literate, using pinyin that was even misspelled in some areas. Fortunately, Ye Xiao was a patient person, or else he might have already cursed him out.</p><p></p><p>That morning, as Ye Xiao was analyzing Fa Xin's map, the voice of Fa Zheng suddenly sounded in his ear.</p><p></p><p>"Disciple Ye, are you busy?"</p><p></p><p>Ye Xiao lightly hummed in response, looking up at him with some confusion. "Aren't you supposed to be at the Martial Arts Academy, handling the establishment of your branch? Why do you have time to come here?"</p><p></p><p>Fa Zheng explained, "It's not convenient right now. I need to borrow and study some Buddhist cultivation methods to strengthen my own abilities."</p><p></p><p>"Why the sudden need to strengthen your powers? Aren't you already a Fifth Realm Patriarch?"</p><p></p><p>"This is a secret history of our Shaolin. Every year around this time, we Fa-surnamed professors at Shaolin need to delve into Buddhist teachings."</p><p></p><p>Seeing Ye Xiao's brow furrow with puzzlement, Fa Zheng continued, "It's like this: Thirty-six years ago, a Buddhist genius from India named Aro appeared. He came to challenge the peers of our Central Plains Buddhist cultivators, just as Pu Jiansheng challenged the Nine States swordsmen.</p><p></p><p>That year, Aro's Buddhist attainments were profound, and he defeated countless geniuses of the Central Plains Buddhist and Taoist paths. To this day, he still comes to the Central Plains every year to challenge our Buddhist peers. And he wins every single time!"</p><p></p><p>Ye Xiao was surprised to hear this. He wasn't shocked that Aro could defeat his Central Plains Buddhist peers, since he was only challenging those of the same generation. If he had challenged elders of higher realms, he definitely wouldn't have been able to win. And the younger geniuses likely wouldn't even bother fighting him.</p><p></p><p>What puzzled Ye Xiao was something else.</p><p></p><p>"But if he's been winning so many times already, why does he still keep coming? Continuing to win serves no purpose, right? As a true genius, he shouldn't be like those fools, constantly boasting about their skills and power, right?"</p><p></p><p>"You ask a good question. He's not coming to show off his abilities. He's looking for someone."</p><p></p><p>"Who?"</p><p></p><p>"My Dharma brother Fa Xin."</p><p></p><p>Ye Xiao's eyes flickered. He hadn't expected Fa Xin to be Fa Zheng's Dharma brother.</p><p></p><p>"Why is he looking for Fa Xin?"</p><p></p><p>"Because Fa Xin once defeated him."</p><p></p><p>Thirty-six years ago, when Aro first came to the Nine States, he challenged the geniuses of our Central Plains Buddhist path. At that time, many of my Dharma brothers had already been sent out to establish branch monasteries and spread the Buddhist martial arts culture.</p><p></p><p>Fa Xin was sent to a city near Qin State - Lincheng. His innate talents were actually not that good, but for some reason, the Buddhist master Aro from India declared defeat in Lincheng and retreated back to India, only to return the next year to challenge again.</p><p></p><p>However, after Aro left, we Shaolin immediately sent people to look for Fa Xin, only to find that he had mysteriously disappeared without a trace. We've searched many times, but there's been no news of him.</p><p></p><p>Yet Aro from India still comes to challenge us every year. Without Fa Xin, none of us are his match. We can only continue cultivating year after year, hoping to one day break through and...</p><p></p><p>Here is the full English translation of the Chinese excerpt:</p><p></p><p>"I must defeat him.</p><p></p><p>This year, I am quite fortunate to have broken through to the Innate Fifth Rank, and my strength has greatly improved. The Shaolin Monastery hopes that I can prepare carefully and see if I can defeat him."</p><p></p><p>"I see."</p><p></p><p>Ye Xiao did not expect that there were such secrets involved.</p><p></p><p>However, upon further reflection, he understood.</p><p></p><p>Fa Xin obtained the Tathagata Palm Technique forty years ago when he encountered Aro. He had already practiced it for four years at that time.</p><p></p><p>The advancement of the Imperial Art is not like the advancement of ordinary cultivation methods, especially for a supreme Buddhist technique like the Tathagata Palm Technique, which is extremely powerful.</p><p></p><p>Therefore, it was only natural that he was able to defeat Aro thirty-six years ago.</p><p></p><p>After that, he sealed himself within the mountain to imprison the half-beast demon spirit, so the Shaolin Monastery had no idea of his whereabouts.</p><p></p><p>Later, it was Ye Xiao who used the Mysterious Heaven Dipper to locate his position and learn of his death.</p><p></p><p>As for that Aro, he comes every year, presumably still unwilling to accept Fa Xin's superiority and wanting to challenge him again.</p><p></p><p>Unfortunately, he can no longer find Fa Xin.</p><p></p><p>Ye Xiao had no interest in such trivial matters.</p><p></p><p>If Liu Chengxun and Murakami Hibiki's identities were not each far beyond Aro's, he would not have bothered with them either, 100% guaranteed.</p><p></p><p>This so-called "challenge" is just a fancy term for exchanging martial arts culture, but in the end, it's all about who can be number one, to satisfy one's own inner desires.</p><p></p><p>"Then you should work hard. The best masters in Shaolin's martial arts are at the Fifth and Sixth Realms, so I won't accompany you."</p><p></p><p>Fa Zheng nodded.</p><p></p><p>"I also came to greet Master Ye, as you are the only friend I have in Jianghai City."</p><p></p><p>Ye Xiao nodded.</p><p></p><p>"Let's have lunch together at the cafeteria, my treat."</p><p></p><p>After all, Fa Zheng only eats a bowl of white rice and drinks a cup of plain water.</p><p></p><p>"Thank you, Master Ye."</p><p></p><p>After that, Fa Zheng left Ye Xiao and headed to the fifth floor of the library.</p><p></p><p>As soon as Fa Zheng left, Ye Xiao was about to continue repairing the map when Yang Qian came to call him.</p><p></p><p>"Manager Ye, the director is calling for you."</p><p></p><p>Ye Xiao raised his eyebrows slightly.</p><p></p><p>"Why would the director suddenly summon me at this time?"</p><p></p><p>"I don't know, the other managers have also been called. The director's tone seemed quite urgent."</p><p></p><p>"I see."</p><p></p><p>Ye Xiao rubbed his temples, put away the map, and quickly went to the director's office. The other library managers had already arrived.</p><p></p><p>The atmosphere in the entire office was quite solemn.</p><p></p><p>Ye Xiao's expression remained calm, but his mind was active as he activated the Mysterious Heaven Dipper to scan the director's memories. He was immediately taken aback.</p><p></p><p>"So it's about this matter!"</p><p></p><p>He couldn't help muttering, his expression somewhat exasperated.</p><p></p><p>"Ah, Little Ye has arrived."</p><p></p><p>The director greeted him, and Ye Xiao nodded.</p><p></p><p>"Come, have a seat. You're the last one."</p><p></p><p>Ye Xiao found a seat towards the back.</p><p></p><p>Ouyang Yunzhong immediately spoke up:</p><p></p><p>"Today, we have someone applying for a position here. And this person is no ordinary person. The request from the Central Province is to give him an easy position, not to let him do any work, but also not to let anyone provoke him, including ourselves."</p><p></p><p>The group immediately began discussing.</p><p></p><p>"Who is this person? Who is so impressive?"</p><p></p><p>"Is this the child of some leader? With such a powerful identity, they just give him an easy position and pay him monthly without having to work."</p><p></p><p>"And we can't even provoke him? Does that mean we managers can't even manage him? That's outrageous!"</p><p></p><p>Ouyang Yunzhong pushed up his glasses.</p><p></p><p>"He is not the son of some leader. As long as you don't provoke him, there won't be any trouble. Even if he kills you, the Central Province will avenge you.</p><p></p><p>But if any of you provoke him first and get killed, don't blame me for not warning you. You'll just die in vain, and at most the library will give your family a small burial fee and condolence payment."</p><p></p><p>"Damn, who is this person? He's that impressive?"</p><p></p><p>"The Sword Saint of Hanzhou, Liu Chengxun."</p><p></p><p>The entire conference room fell into dead silence. Everyone was shocked, except for Ye Xiao, who was at the back and went unnoticed.</p><p></p><p>"Director, you can't be joking with us, right? Liu Chengxun is coming to work at our library?"</p><p></p><p>"I'm not joking. This is the truth. He wants to stay in the Central Province for a while, and the Central Province attaches great importance to this matter.</p><p></p><p>Although he sincerely wants to stay in Jianghai City, he is after all a Deity Realm expert, and if anything happens, we won't be able to control the situation very well."</p>

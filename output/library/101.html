        <h1>Chapter 101</h1>
        <div class="content">
            <p>Here is the full English translation of the Chinese excerpt:</p><p></p><p>"Master, you've made my belly so big," the cat said.</p><p></p><p>Ye Xiao glanced at her and swallowed the roasted meat in his mouth.</p><p></p><p>"Then put down the fish in your mouth."</p><p></p><p>"No, I'm digesting it, and I can still eat more."</p><p></p><p>The jade cat waddled along beside Ye Xiao, looking puzzled as she eyed his belly.</p><p></p><p>How strange, why hasn't Ye Xiao's belly gotten any bigger at all? He's been eating much more than her.</p><p></p><p>In fact, this was due to his cultivation of the Indestructible Divine Technique.</p><p></p><p>The Indestructible Divine Technique cultivates both the exterior and interior.</p><p></p><p>The exterior cultivation is of the tendons, bones, and skin, while the interior cultivation is of the five zang organs and six fu organs.</p><p></p><p>The entire digestive system, including the heart, spleen, liver, stomach, and kidneys, has been greatly enhanced through the technique. </p><p></p><p>For ordinary food, his digestion speed is extremely fast, and it won't cause him to get fat or feel bloated.</p><p></p><p>Unless he eats things with an extremely strong vital energy, his digestion might be a bit slower.</p><p></p><p>For example, the Godking-level Aer King.</p><p></p><p>Ye Xiao had been craving the Aer King for a long time.</p><p></p><p>Ever since he saw the information on the Aer King, whenever he drank lamb or beef soup, he couldn't help but think of it.</p><p></p><p>The Aer King looked a bit like a wildebeest, he wasn't sure if it was a sheep or a cow.</p><p></p><p>But its explosive musculature had always made Ye Xiao salivate.</p><p></p><p>The tendon meat would make the most delicious braised meat, with a nice chew and texture.</p><p></p><p>And the Aer King's cultivation level was very high, so its meat must be filled with vital energy, which could indirectly boost Ye Xiao's own cultivation.</p><p></p><p>Ye Xiao had decided long ago that half of the Aer King's flesh would be used to refine elixirs, while the other half would be divided into 20 jin of roasted skewers, 20 jin of stewed with bone, 20 jin of braised, and 20 jin of stewed with potatoes.</p><p></p><p>The master and servant continued walking and eating, and by around 12 o'clock, the black market was at its busiest.</p><p></p><p>All kinds of stalls had set up.</p><p></p><p>At this time, a few members of the defense squad also came to patrol, and among them was Gu Hai.</p><p></p><p>After the special training camp, his cultivation had broken through to the late Heavenly Fourth Realm, and he was about to reach the limit, soon able to break through to the Heavenly Fifth Realm. Even the muscles on his arms had grown larger, and his skin had darkened quite a bit.</p><p></p><p>It was clear that he was really pushing himself for his wife and child.</p><p></p><p>Since Ye Xiao had already disguised himself, he didn't mind walking past Gu Hai.</p><p></p><p>A short-haired, beautiful colleague of Gu Hai's swallowed hard.</p><p></p><p>"The guy who just walked by was so handsome."</p><p></p><p>Gu Hai glanced at Ye Xiao and couldn't help but roll his eyes.</p><p></p><p>"What's so handsome about him? My brother is much better-looking."</p><p></p><p>"Is he the same one you met at the library the other time?"</p><p></p><p>"Yeah!"</p><p></p><p>"Now that you mention it, that guy's looks are really unforgettable even now. Does he have a girlfriend? If not, can you give him my WeChat?"</p><p></p><p>"No way, my brother's looks are so high-level, he's not even on the level of a school belle. You may be pretty good-looking too, but you're at most a class belle - way too inferior to date my brother."</p><p></p><p>The distant Ye Xiao couldn't help but feel comforted upon hearing this.</p><p></p><p>Gu Hai still thought highly of him, and it wasn't in vain that he had befriended him.</p><p></p><p>"I have two movie tickets here, you can take your wife to watch a movie."</p><p></p><p>"Alright, I'll give him your WeChat."</p><p></p><p>Ye Xiao stumbled a bit, he had let his guard down.</p><p></p><p>This rascal actually sold him out for two movie tickets.</p><p></p><p>Oh well, time to focus on the main task.</p><p></p><p>Here is the full English translation of the Chinese excerpt:</p><p></p><p>The Taixuan Tiangong (Grand Celestial Formation) was activated, sweeping across the entire black market, and Ye Xiao had already found the items he currently wanted.</p><p></p><p>He came to a stall, and the owner, whose cultivation was at the post-Heavenly Third Grade, was a middle-aged man wearing a leather jacket.</p><p></p><p>Seeing him approach, the owner immediately asked with a smile, "Little brother, what are you looking to buy?"</p><p></p><p>"I'm looking for some good, special materials for refining weapons."</p><p></p><p>"Of course, you've come to the right place. Take a look at this, a shell of a Rock Turtle! This is a shell from a Transcendent-level Rock Turtle, you know, when buying spirit pets, the higher the bloodline, the better. But when it comes to refining materials, the stronger the beast was in life, the better.</p><p></p><p>If you take this back and make it into a heart-protecting mirror, attacks below the Grandmaster level won't be a problem for you!</p><p></p><p>And this, a Transcendent-level Fire Fox pelt, can be made into a shoulder pad. Not only can it defend against some spiritual energy impacts, but it can also warm the shoulders, clear stagnation and activate the blood, reducing arm fatigue and enhancing combat ability."</p><p></p><p>Ye Xiao responded casually, not paying too much attention to these items.</p><p></p><p>What he was truly interested in was a broken scale, only the size of half a palm, but the remaining essence on it was quite remarkable.</p><p></p><p>"How much for this item?"</p><p></p><p>"This one?" </p><p></p><p>The vendor, seeing Ye Xiao's interest in the scale, couldn't help but be a bit surprised.</p><p></p><p>"I didn't expect you to be able to recognize the extraordinary nature of this scale at a glance, little brother, you've got some skills.</p><p></p><p>This item is something I collected from a friend. It's a good thing, I heard it was found in a mountain ravine in the south. Unfortunately, it's only half a scale, so it might not be able to refine anything good.</p><p></p><p>If you want it, just give me the cost price, 8,000 yuan."</p><p></p><p>Hearing this, Ye Xiao smiled and put the scale back down.</p><p></p><p>"8,000 yuan, that's a bit too steep, isn't it? This item is indeed very good, but it's only half a scale, so the thing that can be refined from it will be quite limited. And you also need to find a strong enough refiner to do it. Who would buy it for 8,000 yuan?"</p><p></p><p>The vendor rubbed his nose awkwardly and chuckled.</p><p></p><p>"I didn't expect this little brother to be an old hand. Alright, I'll treat you as a friend, 5,000 yuan, and the item is yours."</p><p></p><p>"1,500."</p><p></p><p>Ye Xiao suddenly spoke up, causing the vendor's smile to immediately disappear.</p><p></p><p>"1,500 yuan, little brother, your bargaining is a bit ruthless, isn't it?"</p><p></p><p>"1,500 yuan, not a penny more. You think about it."</p><p></p><p>The other party helplessly waved his hand.</p><p></p><p>"You win, take it. But in the future, be sure to come by more often."</p><p></p><p>"Definitely."</p><p></p><p>After the transaction, Ye Xiao left with the scale.</p><p></p><p>In fact, the main body of this scale should only be at the Transcendent level, and there are many better items than this one in the entire black market, including a lot of materials from Grandmaster-level spirit beasts.</p><p></p><p>But what Ye Xiao was interested in was not this, but the fact that this scale was very fresh and still had some vitality, which meant it was not taken from a dead spirit beast, but rather dropped by a living one.</p><p></p><p>He bought this scale for two reasons: one was to try refining high-grade items, and the other was to find the source of the scale.</p><p></p><p>Now he knows that the scale came from the mountain forests in the south.</p><p></p><p>(End of the chapter)</p>

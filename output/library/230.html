        <h1>Chapter 230</h1>
        <div class="content">
            <p>Here is the full English translation of the Chinese excerpt:</p><p></p><p>North Hall Cepointedly nodded.</p><p></p><p>"I've seen it before, in fact, many have seen it, not just me alone. </p><p></p><p>But so far, those who have seen the Warrior Saint's tombstone are few who have achieved anything. Even I have not grasped even a fraction of its profundity.</p><p></p><p>So, it is now no longer believed by the world.</p><p></p><p>However, I think Mr. Ye has such extraordinary natural talent, perhaps he may be able to discern its mysteries."</p><p></p><p>Ye Xiao fell silent for a moment, then nodded and said:</p><p></p><p>"Alright, I'll go take a look. But about my studies at the Central Plains Martial Arts University..."</p><p></p><p>"Don't worry, this old man will take care of it, it won't disturb your normal life."</p><p></p><p>"Then I'm very grateful to the senior."</p><p></p><p>"No need to thank me, as long as you can achieve something, at least be able to protect the people of the Nine Provinces, that's what we should be thanking you for!"</p><p></p><p>After exchanging a few more pleasantries, Ye Xiao followed North Hall Ce's directions to find the Warrior Saint's tombstone.</p><p></p><p>For him, a mere few hundred kilometers was nothing at all.</p><p></p><p>Ye Xiao had almost completed the thought, and the distance was already reached.</p><p></p><p>This was a dilapidated temple, with the life story of the Warrior Saint Han Xin written on the temple door. The inscriptions on the stone tablet had faded over time, and there was even moss growing on it.</p><p></p><p>Ye Xiao had read the historical books, in the ancient times of this world, the martial arts culture was more prosperous, and there were many figures who could astound the long river of history.</p><p></p><p>The Demon God Bai Qi, the Warrior Saint Han Xin, the War God Li Jing - it was because of these people that they could easily defeat the star beasts, and the star beasts could not pose an external threat.</p><p></p><p>So in that era, there was constant warfare between the human tribes.</p><p></p><p>Ye Xiao entered the temple, which was also in a state of disrepair, with cobwebs everywhere.</p><p></p><p>It seems that it is indeed as North Hall Ce said, this place has long been disbelieved.</p><p></p><p>As Ye Xiao stepped into the temple, a dark energy immediately invaded his body.</p><p></p><p>It was the wandering lonely souls, hiding in this temple, and now they could smell the fresh blood on the human, so they began to gather around.</p><p></p><p>Ye Xiao's eyes flickered, his spiritual power burst forth, directly shattering the soul bodies of these resentful spirits.</p><p></p><p>Then, he turned his gaze to the stone statue in front of him.</p><p></p><p>It was a statue of the Warrior Saint Han Xin, and even after more than a thousand years, when Ye Xiao saw the statue, he couldn't help but feel a slight shock.</p><p></p><p>The winds of history had aged his sculpture, but Ye Xiao could still feel a powerful and unrestrained aura from that statue.</p><p></p><p>It was an aura of overlooking the world, treating the world as insignificant as grass.</p><p></p><p>Ye Xiao was not Han Xin, nor was he a great figure, his realm was definitely not as high as the ancient general Han Xin, but he could still feel and absorb Han Xin's aura, and make it his own.</p><p></p><p>Mysteriously, Ye Xiao felt that his soul body seemed to have changed, as if his soul power had increased much faster than before.</p><p></p><p>He took a deep breath and stepped into the temple.</p><p></p><p>The Warrior Saint's tombstone was behind the temple.</p><p></p><p>Some say that the remains of the Warrior Saint Han Xin are preserved here, but over the years, countless people have come to dig here in the Nine Provinces, but under the tombstone, there is only three feet of yellow earth.</p><p></p><p>The tombstone has been probed countless times, it is just an ordinary stone, but it is as heavy as Mount Tai, and no one has been able to take it away.</p><p></p><p>Over time, it has also been abandoned here.</p><p></p><p>Ye Xiao used the Taixuan Tiangong technique to scan the tombstone, but it had no effect, and the spiritual power exploration showed that it was just an extremely ordinary large stone.</p><p></p><p>Thinking about it, it makes sense, with so many people in the Nine Provinces, there must be someone who has cultivated to the Imperial Dao level spiritual techniques.</p><p></p><p>Like North Hall Ce's eye technique, compared to the Imperial Dao level techniques, it is also strong but not the strongest!</p><p></p><p>However, he still couldn't see through the mystery of this tombstone.</p><p></p><p>"All along, I've been relying on the Golden Book, I don't know if the Golden Book has the ability to see through the hidden secrets of the tombstone."</p><p></p><p>As he spoke, Ye Xiao released the spiritual body of the Golden Book.</p><p></p><p>This was the second time he had released the spiritual body of the Golden Book outside his body, the previous time was to deal with the Great Dragon.</p><p></p><p>As the Golden Book emerged, the world changed dramatically, and everything in the heavens and earth seemed to fade.</p><p></p><p>The surrounding scene began to change rapidly, as if time was rewinding and evolving the grand historical war scenes of the Nine Provinces over a thousand years ago.</p><p></p><p>Among this, a tall figure in golden armor, wielding a whip in one hand and carrying his hands behind his back, pointing at the rivers and mountains, as if war was just a game for him to play with a flick of his hand.</p><p></p><p>Ye Xiao could feel that although this was all an illusion, that figure exuded an awe-inspiring power, like a towering giant!</p><p></p><p>Is this the Warrior Saint Han Xin?</p><p></p><p>Even as a mere illusion, it contained a momentum that ordinary people could not even approach!</p><p></p><p>Ye Xiao spoke to the figure:</p><p></p><p>"Junior Ye Xiao wishes to break through the Kingly Realm, please impart your teachings, senior."</p><p></p><p>Mysteriously, the illusion seemed to have heard Ye Xiao's words, and swept a indifferent gaze at him, a gaze that contained the vastness of the stars and mountains.</p><p></p><p>"Without the ability to slay kings, how can one become a king?"</p><p></p><p>With these eight calm words, all the illusions faded away.</p><p></p><p>Here is my translation of the Chinese excerpt:</p><p></p><p>That was the disappearance of Han Xin's consciousness, the stone stele shattered, and the last trace of his artistic conception left for posterity was completely extinguished.</p><p></p><p>Ye Xiao's spirit trembled, standing in place, his heart unable to calm down for a long time.</p><p></p><p>Without killing the king, how can one become a king? Is this the magnanimity of the Martial Saint? The king is the strongest expert in the world, also a peak powerhouse on the starry sky battlefield, and everyone looks up to and reveres him.</p><p></p><p>But in his eyes, the king is just cannon fodder? At this moment, Ye Xiao suddenly thought of a sentence.</p><p></p><p>Is there a nobility among princes and nobles? Who stipulates that a king must have some standard? Must there be a realm that people strive for but cannot attain?</p><p></p><p>Those who have entered the realm of kings, are their bloodlines really more special than ordinary people?</p><p></p><p>If we talk about glory and wealth, some people may have been at the peak since birth, but stripped of the magnificent trappings, the two are just flesh and blood.</p><p></p><p>The realm of kings is like this! </p><p></p><p>It is not as noble as imagined, the more it is exalted, the further away it becomes.</p><p></p><p>Only by placing it at the same height as oneself can one step into the realm of kings.</p><p></p><p>Since I have entered the realm of kings, what is wrong with killing the king?</p><p></p><p>I am the king!</p><p></p><p>The golden book had re-entered Ye Xiao's body, and Ye Xiao's physique had also undergone tremendous changes at this moment. He could feel that his spiritual power was constantly increasing, and with the increase in spiritual power, Ye Xiao could feel that his spiritual energy was also constantly rising.</p><p></p><p>The surrounding heaven and earth spiritual energy began to frantically gather into Ye Xiao's body.</p><p></p><p>In the blink of an eye, the entire temple was torn to shreds, a whirlwind constantly rotating around Ye Xiao, with fallen leaves and broken bricks floating in the air. Ye Xiao's body was like a huge magnetic field, making them revolve around him.</p><p></p><p>On the other side, in the mountains outside the Central State City, two figures gathered outside the mountains.</p><p></p><p>"That stupid Yingfu has already died, killed by the human race."</p><p></p><p>"Noel Fei has also disappeared."</p><p></p><p>"Unexpectedly, while we were locked up in Shaolin for hundreds of years, so many strong experts have emerged from the human race. It seems that relying solely on our two powers is completely insufficient to impact the humans. Perhaps it's time to awaken those few in Central State City."</p><p></p><p>"The beast disaster is imminent, and the human race must thoroughly feel the terror brought by the star beast experts. Shatter their fighting courage."</p><p></p><p>Time flashed by, and seven days had passed, and Central State City was still peaceful, no different from the past.</p><p></p><p>But at the confluence of the three rivers outside Central State City, a strange figure suddenly appeared.</p><p></p><p>He wore a black robe, tall and thin, his proportions completely different from normal people.</p><p></p><p>A pair of withered tree branch-like big hands extended from the wide sleeves, clapping his hands, and a hundred and eight human martial artists suddenly appeared in the air above the river.</p><p></p><p>The martial artists suddenly appeared, seeing the turbulent river below, all felt a sense of unease, and began to scream.</p><p></p><p>"Ah—!"</p><p></p><p>"Help—!"</p><p></p><p>But as soon as they shouted, the other party's hands immediately made a seal, directly detonating the bodies of all the martial artists.</p><p></p><p>One hundred and eight streams of blood qi, like long snakes, slowly fell into the river water, forming a strange pattern on the surface of the river.</p><p></p><p>Roar—! In an instant, a violent roar came from the bottom of the river.</p><p></p><p>Vaguely, several huge beast shadows emerged from the turbulent river water and began to swim.</p><p></p><p>Gradually, a mass of black mist surged in the sky, full of evil power.</p><p></p><p>The black shadow let out a cackling laugh.</p><p></p><p>"Awaken, Tree Demon—Aduluosi, Earth Mysterious Python King—Kunlong, Ice Lord—Gusheng, and Sword God—Azuosha! Follow me to bring terror to the human race!"</p><p></p><p>In Central State City, Beitang Ce, who was originally reading in the library, suddenly frowned, his face grim as he disappeared from the spot.</p><p></p><p>Reappearing, he had appeared in the sky above Central State City, sweeping towards the outside of Central State City.</p><p></p><p>Several other powerful figures also quickly came to his side.</p><p></p><p>Among them were two people, Stone Guanghao and Lang Xingyue, who had previously gone to the River and Sea City and were ranked among the top fifty on the World Dragon Ranking!</p><p></p><p>"Senior Beitang, this aura, could it be...?"</p><p></p><p>Beitang Ce nodded solemnly.</p><p></p><p>"That's right, someone has broken the seal. "</p><p></p><p>"Who did it?"</p><p></p><p>Beitang Ce's ghost fire spirit eyes flashed, and two beams of ghostly light seemed to easily penetrate hundreds of miles away and see the situation in the distance.</p><p></p><p>"It's the star beasts! Deity Sect-level star beasts. It seems to be one of the star beasts that escaped from Shaolin."</p><p></p><p>"We'll go catch him immediately."</p><p></p><p>"It's too late, the formation has already been destroyed, in at most ten minutes, it will be completely released, without a formation master, we going there would be in vain.</p><p></p><p>Notify the citizens of Central State City to migrate northward as soon as possible, try to avoid this disaster.</p><p></p><p>Notify the Nine State Alliance to send one of the Four Venerable Ones, otherwise Central State will be doomed."</p>

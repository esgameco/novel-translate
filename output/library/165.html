        <h1>Chapter 165</h1>
        <div class="content">
            <p>Here is the full English translation of the Chinese excerpt:</p><p></p><p>Ye Xiao understood that the power within Fa Xin had been completely exhausted.</p><p></p><p>This mountain had previously been heavily eroded by vengeful spirits, so it was about to collapse.</p><p></p><p>If it weren't for the power of the Tathagata Palm within Fa Xin, it probably would have collapsed long ago.</p><p></p><p>Now that Fa Xin's power had completely disappeared, it was only natural that it had reached its end.</p><p></p><p>Lin Wan immediately spoke to Ye Xiao:</p><p></p><p>"You must leave quickly, this mountain is about to collapse."</p><p></p><p>Ye Xiao looked at her with some confusion.</p><p></p><p>Lin Wan wiped away her tears and smiled, saying, "I've waited for him for so many years, and now that I've finally found him, where else would I go?"</p><p></p><p>Ye Xiao did not leave, but instead walked towards Lin Wan's back.</p><p></p><p>Lin Wan exclaimed in alarm, "Why are you walking back? Have you gone mad? You'll die!"</p><p></p><p>Ye Xiao spoke calmly:</p><p></p><p>"Every life bears the hopes of its loved ones, the expectations of its beloved, and the thoughts of its friends. It should be cherished."</p><p></p><p>As he spoke, he clenched his right fist and punched towards the collapsing mountain, to Lin Wan's astonished gaze. Lin Wan swore she had never witnessed such a scene in her life.</p><p></p><p>With a single punch, the heavens shattered and the earth split. A 4,000-meter-high mountain was directly reduced to rubble by this seemingly unremarkable human fist!</p><p></p><p>The fist light shot towards the sky, actually blasting a huge gap in the clouds above, causing the starlight to pour down, mysterious and extraordinary yet also eerie.</p><p></p><p>Ye Xiao had disappeared from the original spot, with no one knowing when he had vanished - perhaps in the instant of the punch, or perhaps in the moment Lin Wan was dumbfounded.</p><p></p><p>Lin Wan stood there, her face filled with disbelief at the sight.</p><p></p><p>Had she encountered a deity?</p><p></p><p>Three days later, in Jianghai City.</p><p></p><p>A figure in a pure white robe silently appeared above the surface of the Jianghai River. </p><p></p><p>He walked with his hands behind his back, floating in the air above the river, and any ordinary person could tell at a glance that he was a powerful expert above the Dazong level.</p><p></p><p>Because only those at the Dazong level or above would possess the ability to levitate.</p><p></p><p>Many passing passengers and ship owners couldn't help but take photos and post them on their social media, as powerful experts at the Dazong level were not common in this small town of Jianghai City.</p><p></p><p>Sword Immortal Senior was very strong, but he was elusive, so people rarely got to see him. Therefore, a Dazong expert could easily become a hot topic.</p><p></p><p>Soon, the photos began circulating widely on the social media of Jianghai City, causing quite a stir.</p><p></p><p>At the Jianghai City Martial Arts Academy, Pao Jiansheng had just finished his sword practice when some classmates came over to compliment him:</p><p></p><p>"Pao, your sword skills have really improved."</p><p></p><p>Pao Jiansheng took a deep breath, his expression serious:</p><p></p><p>"It's still not enough, I'm still far behind."</p><p></p><p>He glanced at the sword marks on the bronze ox in the distance, feeling a deep sense of powerlessness every time he saw them. </p><p></p><p>The sword intent in that strike was too powerful, far beyond what he could currently comprehend. It was like staring at an insurmountable mountain.</p><p></p><p>"Oh right, Pao, have you seen the news? Jianghai City has another Dazong expert now."</p><p></p><p>"Oh? Did someone advance to that level?"</p><p></p><p>"No, it's a new face. He's wearing white robes and just standing motionless on the river surface. We don't know what he's up to."</p><p></p><p>Pao Jiansheng's expression changed, and he quickly asked, "What does he look like? Let me see."</p><p></p><p>One of the classmates immediately handed over his phone.</p><p></p><p>"Here, he's all over my social media feed today. The whole city is talking about him."</p><p></p><p>Pao Jiansheng took the phone and took a quick look, his breathing momentarily stilling. His gaze then became extremely serious.</p><p></p><p>"He's not a Dazong expert."</p><p></p><p>"Huh? He's not a Dazong expert? Then what is he?"</p><p></p><p>"Only Dazong experts can stand and float in midair like that."</p><p></p><p>Pao Jiansheng spoke again, word by word:</p><p></p><p>"This is my master, the Sword Saint of Hanzhou, Liu Chengxun!"</p><p></p><p>With that, he immediately returned the phone to his classmate and hurried towards the riverside.</p><p></p><p>The other classmates, after their initial stunned silence, immediately erupted in excitement.</p><p></p><p>"What? He said that's his master, the Sword Saint of Hanzhou? A Saint-level expert?"</p><p></p><p>"Oh my god, it's actually a Saint-level cultivator who has come! I thought he was just a Dazong!"</p><p></p><p>"What are you waiting for? Hurry up and post the news! This is such an explosive piece of information, it's bound to attract tons of attention!"</p><p></p><p>"Yes, yes! Post it quickly!"</p><p></p><p>Soon, the social media and forums of Jianghai City were all abuzz with heated discussions.</p><p></p><p>The topic "The Mysterious Figure on the River is Actually the Sword Saint of Hanzhou Liu Chengxun!" quickly went viral.</p><p></p><p>Here is the full English translation of the Chinese excerpt:</p><p></p><p>"It's confirmed, Liu Chengxun has come to Jianghai City to challenge our senior swordmaster."</p><p></p><p>The news of Liu Chengxun's identity immediately set the entire Jianghai City ablaze.</p><p></p><p>Countless people began rushing towards the riverside.</p><p></p><p>Ten thousand, fifty thousand, a hundred thousand, two hundred thousand, five hundred thousand, a million... </p><p></p><p>The scale quickly grew to over a million.</p><p></p><p>At the same time, numerous live streams were opened online, with even official news outlets joining the live coverage.</p><p></p><p>The view counts on these live streams were continuously breaking records.</p><p></p><p>The total viewership across all media outlets skyrocketed from zero to over a million, then rapidly surpassed tens of millions, reaching over a hundred million in the blink of an eye.</p><p></p><p>Han Zhou Sword Saint Liu Chengxun is ranked 49th on the World Dragon Rankings, which means that excluding the powerhouses of the Starry Sky Battlefield, he is the 49th strongest in the world! Being ranked 49th among hundreds of billions of people, how astonishing an achievement is that?</p><p></p><p>Normally, such an existence is rarely seen by the common folk.</p><p></p><p>But now, with his sudden appearance, who wouldn't be captivated? Even great masters like Dou Changfeng and Fa Zheng rushed over immediately, and the other nearby city's great masters also hurried over upon hearing the news, unwilling to miss this long-awaited confrontation.</p><p></p><p>On one side is the most mysterious powerhouse of Jianghai City, and on the other is the renowned Han Zhou Sword Saint, the 49th ranked existence on the World Dragon Rankings.</p><p></p><p>Moreover, everyone has been extremely curious about the identity of the elusive Swordmaster.</p><p></p><p>"So that's Han Zhou Sword Saint Liu Chengxun? He's so strong!" </p><p></p><p>Dou Changfeng couldn't help but exclaim in awe.</p><p></p><p>Fa Zheng sighed beside him:</p><p></p><p>"He's truly no ordinary person. Just by standing there, he seems to have merged with the surrounding environment. People can only see his form, but cannot sense the immense power he possesses. It's as if he's just a sheet of paper.</p><p></p><p>Yet, with just a single thought, he could instantly reduce everyone here to ashes."</p><p></p><p>"This is the realm of the Immortal Sect! I wonder if you and I will ever have the chance to step into that level in our lifetimes."</p><p></p><p>At this moment, some other great masters like Qin Shenglong also hurried over upon hearing the news.</p><p></p><p>Dou Changfeng couldn't help but ask Qin Shenglong, "Shenglong, didn't you say you were going to the Starry Sky Battlefield?"</p><p></p><p>Qin Shenglong nodded, then smiled, "I'll leave after witnessing this earth-shattering battle. Otherwise, I'll regret it for the rest of my life."</p><p></p><p>"Yes, this is truly a once-in-a-lifetime peak confrontation!" </p><p></p><p>The crowd sighed in awe.</p><p></p><p>However, at this moment, another figure suddenly appeared, flying in from the eastern horizon. This figure moved at an incredible speed, arriving at the scene in the blink of an eye.</p><p></p><p>As soon as he arrived, the originally aloof and motionless Liu Chengxun suddenly opened his eyes.</p><p></p><p>This sight left many in the crowd utterly stunned.</p><p></p><p>"Look, Liu Chengxun has opened his eyes! He's opened his eyes!"</p><p></p><p>"The one who just arrived, could it be the Immortal Sword Sect's Ninja Sword God from Yingzhou, Village Hikaru, ranked 50th on the World Dragon Rankings?"</p><p></p><p>"Yes, it must be him. Only he would have the qualifications to make the Han Zhou Sword Saint Liu Chengxun take notice. No one else would have that privilege."</p><p></p><p>The newcomer arrived with a smile on his face, addressing Liu Chengxun from afar:</p><p></p><p>"Brother Liu, it's been a while. I hope you've been well."</p><p></p><p>Liu Chengxun replied calmly:</p><p></p><p>"Brother Village, I've heard that you've gained new insights in the previous Seven Star Convergence, and your strength has likely increased considerably, am I right?"</p><p></p><p>Village Hikaru smiled slightly.</p><p></p><p>"Indeed, and I've also heard that Brother Liu has broken through to the Xiantian Eighth Realm, is that true?"</p><p></p><p>Liu Chengxun's eyes narrowed, but he responded without a trace of emotion:</p><p></p><p>"Brother Village, haven't you also broken through to the Xiantian Eighth Realm?"</p><p></p><p>The two exchanged a few words, both with a hint of confrontation, yet also a sense of mutual admiration.</p><p></p><p>Regardless, both of them were extremely confident in their own abilities, as reaching the Xiantian Eighth Realm was an extraordinary feat.</p><p></p><p>The people on both sides of the riverbank couldn't help but exclaim in amazement.</p><p></p><p>"Heavens, they've both reached the Xiantian Eighth Realm? Their cultivation speed is unbelievable!"</p><p></p><p>"Well, they are ranked among the top 50 in the world, so their cultivation speed is naturally faster than ordinary people."</p><p></p><p>"But Liu Chengxun is only 45 years old, right? A 45-year-old at the Xiantian Eighth Realm, aside from the top few peak experts in our Nine Provinces, I doubt anyone else could match him."</p><p></p><p>Among the crowd, Pu Jiansheng shook his head.</p><p></p><p>"No, my master is actually 44 years old!"</p><p></p><p>"Whew!"</p><p></p><p>The surrounding people all sucked in a sharp breath of air.</p><p></p><p>So strong.</p><p></p><p>Although it's just a one-year difference, for ordinary people, it would take countless years to reach this level, if they could even achieve it at all.</p>

        <h1>Chapter 88</h1>
        <div class="content">
            <p>Here is the full English translation of the Chinese excerpt:</p><p></p><p>A supreme indestructible divine skill, which can raise Ye Xiao's physical defense capabilities to several times that of a Grand Master.</p><p></p><p>It should be known that although the physical body of a Grand Master is powerful, it still has a limit. Even after reaching the limit, they can still be injured.</p><p></p><p>For example, attacks comparable to or even surpassing the level of a Grand Master can still injure a Grand Master.</p><p></p><p>But with the Indestructible Divine Skill, Ye Xiao's defensive capabilities can be greatly enhanced. Even if he does not dodge, evade or counterattack, he can still withstand the attacks of a Grand Master through the sheer toughness of his body.</p><p></p><p>Jin Shu immediately began to cultivate the Indestructible Divine Skill. It was now 2 a.m. at night, and Ye Xiao returned to his room to rest. By tomorrow morning, the Indestructible Divine Skill should have reached the peak realm.</p><p></p><p>Early the next morning, Ye Xiao looked at the high blanket and fell into deep thought.</p><p></p><p>The Indestructible Divine Skill had already been cultivated to the peak realm, but he was not considering this problem now, but rather whether this technique would really turn him into steel!</p><p></p><p>He sat up and tried it out, finally letting out a sigh of relief.</p><p></p><p>Fortunately, without activating the technique, he was still normal.</p><p></p><p>Subsequently, he activated the Indestructible Divine Skill, and surprisingly found that his body was enveloped in a golden glow.</p><p></p><p>This golden glow originated from Jin Shu's divine soul, and then spread from the divine soul to the area one millimeter outside Ye Xiao's body.</p><p></p><p>Although the distance it spread was not far, it gave Ye Xiao's defensive power an extraordinary boost.</p><p></p><p>Every inch of Ye Xiao's skin, even every single cell, was protected by the Indestructible Divine Skill and could withstand attacks at the Grand Master level.</p><p></p><p>He tried punching himself.</p><p></p><p>Duang~! Duang~! His fist made a crisp metallic sound, with a very clear and pleasant texture.</p><p></p><p>"Incredible, let's see how strong an attack this technique can withstand."</p><p></p><p>Taking a deep breath, Ye Xiao unleashed the Severing Heaven Sword on his own arm.</p><p></p><p>Pu Tong~!</p><p></p><p>The entire room fell silent. Ye Xiao looked at the arm lying quietly on the floor, deep in thought.</p><p></p><p>He had been careless.</p><p></p><p>The Severing Heaven Sword and the Indestructible Divine Skill should be at the same level.</p><p></p><p>Normally, the most a Grand Master could use would be Patriarch-level techniques, but the Severing Heaven Sword far exceeded that category.</p><p></p><p>Therefore, the Indestructible Divine Skill could not withstand its attack.</p><p></p><p>Sighing softly, Ye Xiao picked up his arm, used the Mending Heavens Technique to repair it, and soon his arm was completely healed without even a scar left.</p><p></p><p>It seems that with the Indestructible Divine Skill, he could not defend against everything. He could only say that defending against Grand Master-level or surpassing Deity Patriarch-level attacks was not a problem.</p><p></p><p>To obtain even higher defensive power, he would need even greater cultivation. Then, when he activated the Indestructible Divine Skill, his defensive power would be even stronger.</p><p></p><p>But cultivation was not something that could be achieved overnight. Perhaps he should pick up forging again and try to refine some powerful defensive armors.</p><p></p><p>Ordinary or superior-grade defensive armors would definitely not work. </p><p></p><p>They had no special abilities and couldn't even change shape, and their defensive power was not even enough to match a Grand Master's own defense, let alone with his Indestructible Divine Skill.</p><p></p><p>Patriarch-grade defensive armors could perhaps be made to look like ordinary clothes, but their defensive power would only be able to withstand Grand Master-level attacks, and even that would have a limit.</p><p></p><p>For ordinary martial artists, or even Patriarchs and Grand Masters, they might need...</p><p></p><p>Here is the full English translation of the excerpt from the Chinese novel:</p><p></p><p>Such things.</p><p></p><p>But for himself, such things have become a bit ostentatious.</p><p></p><p>"The cultivation method of the Golden Book's spiritual fusion is very powerful. I wonder if the forging techniques after the fusion can surpass the ordinary forging techniques of this world? If it can surpass them, maybe I can forge weapons or defensive armor that surpasses ordinary forging techniques."</p><p></p><p>Ye Xiao has already decided to cultivate the forging techniques well.</p><p></p><p>If he can forge super high-grade defensive armor that can defend against attacks above the Divine Sect, that would be a great life-saving tool for himself.</p><p></p><p>Today is Saturday, no work, but Ye Xiao doesn't have many friends either. Gu Hai got married and has a wife to accompany. As for Ning Yuheng, although Ye Xiao feels like he's flirting with him, Ye Xiao, although he doesn't like to casually date, is still a normal man, so he doesn't often go out to play with him on ordinary days.</p><p></p><p>So, Ye Xiao still goes to the library to read books.</p><p></p><p>However, before he could set out, his phone rang first.</p><p></p><p>Ye Xiao picked up the phone, and the display showed the call was from the librarian Ouyang Yunzhong.</p><p></p><p>"Why would the librarian call me?"</p><p></p><p>Ye Xiao raised his eyebrows slightly, but still answered the call.</p><p></p><p>"Hello, is this Xiao Ye?"</p><p></p><p>"Yes, it's me."</p><p></p><p>"Xiao Ye, are you free today? I've made an appointment with a friend at the Huaxi Pavilion Restaurant. If you're free, can you go see him for me?"</p><p></p><p>Ye Xiao was about to refuse without even thinking about it.</p><p></p><p>Even if you're my boss, you can't just assign me tasks, right? He's paid to work, not your servant.</p><p></p><p>Ye Xiao would rather die outside than let you bully him, and he would never help you meet your friend, even if it meant quitting his job at the library.</p><p></p><p>But before he could say it, the librarian spoke again:</p><p></p><p>"You haven't eaten yet, have you? I've booked a 388 yuan breakfast set for you at Huaxi Pavilion. You know the breakfast there, it's a specialty of our Jianghai City, and it's usually hard to get a reservation. I'm friends with the boss, so I managed to get one. If you don't go, it'll be a waste."</p><p></p><p>Ye Xiao: "(⊙⊙)!"</p><p></p><p>The breakfast at Huaxi Pavilion is indeed renowned, and Ye Xiao has eaten there once, but it was only a 98 yuan set.</p><p></p><p>Later, because it required a long advance reservation to eat there, Ye Xiao never went back.</p><p></p><p>Unexpectedly, the librarian actually knows the boss and has booked a set for him.</p><p></p><p>"Librarian, I'm near Huaxi Pavilion."</p><p></p><p>"That's perfect, just go upstairs to table 306 by the window. I've already notified them, you can just go."</p><p></p><p>"Okay!"</p><p></p><p>Hanging up the phone, a second later, Ye Xiao was fully equipped, and he also grabbed Huan Liuli from the sofa downstairs.</p><p></p><p>He now always keeps Huan Liuli with him, to prevent it from going berserk due to the Seven-Star Convergence.</p><p></p><p>The sleeping Huan Liuli was suddenly grabbed by a huge force on its tail, and the entire cat flew out at supersonic speed.</p><p></p><p>Huan Liuli's expression was like this - (_..)!</p><p></p><p>Watching the constantly flying scenery around it, and the deafening roar in its ears, Huan Liuli fell into doubt about its cat life.</p><p></p><p>Can it really live to 300 years old and reverse Ye Xiao, making him its human pet? Three more, humbly begging for votes, recommendation tickets, and monthly tickets are all welcome.</p><p></p><p>Thank you, reader Wind Flower Peak, for your donation, greatly appreciated!</p><p></p><p>(End of this chapter)</p>

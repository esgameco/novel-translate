        <h1>Chapter 153</h1>
        <div class="content">
            <p>Here is the full English translation of the Chinese excerpt:</p><p></p><p>On Ye Xiao's side, he naturally did not hear the words of the librarian.</p><p></p><p>Because after leaving the office, he had directly teleported to the outside of the library.</p><p></p><p>His speed was too fast, it was almost just a thought, and he could reach the place he wanted to go.</p><p></p><p>Ye Xiao did not leave directly, but first came to the underground.</p><p></p><p>After going out for a few days, he first went to borrow some meat from Noel Phys. After reaching the late stage, it became slower and slower, so he needed to eat more meat of star beasts above the Divine Ancestor level in order to improve his cultivation faster.</p><p></p><p>Noel Phys was cultivating, suddenly, accompanied by a sharp pain, the two fresh tentacles that had just grown well were cut off again by Ye Xiao.</p><p></p><p>He suddenly opened his eyes and saw Ye Xiao directly taking his two newly grown tentacles into his storage ring, and then turned and left, making the whole octopus in a mess.</p><p></p><p>What's going on? Is this a joke? This bastard, now he cuts off my tentacles without even discussing with me?</p><p></p><p>You don't discuss or say a word to notify me either? </p><p></p><p>Are you looking down on me? Treating me like your own livestock, just eating me whenever you want?</p><p></p><p>And why did you have to cut off these two most tender tentacles that just grew out?</p><p></p><p>Why didn't you cut the other tentacles? Why single out these two to bully? Bullying the fish too much!</p><p></p><p>Bullying the fish too much!</p><p></p><p>"Ye Xiao, you wait for me. After 1,500 years, when I've completed my cultivation and fused with the main body, I will definitely kill you! Chop you into mincemeat, shred your body to pieces, and make you into human clan meatballs!"</p><p></p><p>At this time, Ye Xiao had already come outside.</p><p></p><p>Coincidentally, he just happened to run into Gu Hai.</p><p></p><p>He was patrolling in the defense team's patrol car, and there were also many more defense team members on the street.</p><p></p><p>"Old Ye, why are you out during work hours?" Gu Hai greeted him first when he saw him.</p><p></p><p>"I came out to take care of some things. By the way, why are there so many of your defense team members out? Is there another case?"</p><p></p><p>"Don't you know? It's been spreading all over Jianghai City now."</p><p></p><p>Ye Xiao: "???"</p><p></p><p>Seeing his puzzled expression, Gu Hai pointed to his phone.</p><p></p><p>"Check the forum, big news!"</p><p></p><p>Ye Xiao took out his phone, opened the local forum of Jianghai City, and took a glance, feeling slightly surprised.</p><p></p><p>Liu Chengxun was coming.</p><p>Cun Shang Bi Chuan was also coming.</p><p></p><p>The two of them seemed to have made an appointment, one from Yingzhou, the other from Hanzhou, heading straight to Jianghai City, specifically to look for him.</p><p></p><p>It was just like Galberos and Melba wanting to find Ultraman Tiga.</p><p></p><p>He was also a bit speechless, these two really had nothing better to do than to mess around.</p><p></p><p>They actually came over? Is it interesting?</p><p></p><p>And the netizens of Jianghai City were also not afraid of trouble, one crazier than the other.</p><p></p><p>"He's here, he's here, the Sword Saint Liu Chengxun has finally come! I wonder if he can beat our Jianghai City's Sword and Saber Immortal?"</p><p></p><p>"That's a given. He definitely can't beat the Sword and Saber Immortal. The Sword and Saber Immortal senior has cultivated two martial arts simultaneously, and both have reached the Divine Ancestor realm."</p><p></p><p>"You can't say that. Their competition will definitely be a battle of sword techniques. A high-level expert like the Sword and Saber Immortal senior won't lose face. He'll probably only use sword techniques against him, otherwise, even if he wins, it won't be glorious enough."</p><p></p><p>"When dealing with the Koreans, who cares about face? It's him who came to challenge, not the Sword and Saber Immortal senior! Besides, the Sword and Saber Immortal senior has already let him cultivate both sword and saber, if he can't do it, how can he blame the path being uneven?"</p><p></p><p>"Even if it's like that, Cun Shang Bi Chuan is also coming to challenge the Sword and Saber Immortal senior. The two of them coming one after the other, the Sword and Saber Immortal senior is only one person, winning a battle will inevitably cause him some damage. He can't possibly defeat them without a scratch, right?"</p><p></p><p>"Why are there always people like you who belittle your own and praise others? Have you been kneeling for too long that you can't stand up?"</p><p></p><p>"Screw your grandma! I'm just giving a fair comment. A Divine Ancestor fighting two of them, there must be some unfavorable factors, how is that kneeling?"</p><p></p><p>"I don't care, you're just unpatriotic, a spy!"</p><p></p><p>"!@#$@%$@"</p><p></p><p>Seeing these comments, Ye Xiao was simply speechless.</p><p></p><p>Even the protagonist himself was too lazy to care, but the netizens were arguing heatedly.</p><p></p><p>He even couldn't help but suspect that there were some people stirring things up.</p><p></p><p>There might even be a chance that a lot of Hanzhou or Yingzhou people had infiltrated.</p><p></p><p>Gu Hai stuck out his head.</p><p></p><p>"Old Ye, do you want to get rich?"</p><p></p><p>Ye Xiao looked puzzled.</p><p></p><p>"Get rich? Get what kind of money?"</p><p></p><p>Gu Hai looked left and right.</p><p></p><p>"Now there are several families online betting on who's going to win among the three. The current odds for the Sword and Saber Immortal are 1 to 5.</p><p>Liu Chengxun's odds are 1 to 7.</p><p>Cun Shang Bi Chuan's odds are 1 to 2.</p><p></p><p>I've calculated it, if we buy a share of each, no matter if the Sword and Saber Immortal wins or Liu Chengxun wins, we'll make a killing. Even if Cun Shang Bi Chuan wins, we won't lose money, we'll at least break even. What do you think?"</p><p></p><p>The corner of Ye Xiao's mouth couldn't help but twitch.</p><p></p><p>"You're from the defense team, and you can still do this kind of thing?"</p><p></p><p>Here is the full English translation of the Chinese excerpt:</p><p></p><p>"There's no other way, the garrison's salary is not enough. In about ten more days, my wife will give birth, and I need to earn some money for the baby's milk powder.</p><p></p><p>Moreover, I'm not greedy in my daily life. I protect Jianghai City, shedding blood and sweat, and I have a clear conscience.</p><p></p><p>Am I not allowed to use my own money to earn a little extra money?</p><p></p><p>Besides, I'm using my mom's account. No one knows, hehe hehe."</p><p></p><p>"You'd better be careful. Don't you feel something is off? The odds, no matter what, you won't lose. There must be something fishy going on."</p><p></p><p>"Fishy? What do you mean?"</p><p></p><p>"You can download the Jiuzhou Anti-Fraud software. There are many similar cases on it, all of which are scams. There's no free lunch in this world. As a person, you should work hard and rely on your own hands to strive."</p><p></p><p>"Fuck! When you put it that way, I do feel there's some risk. Then what should I do? I still want to earn some milk powder money for the baby."</p><p></p><p>"That's easy. You go and bust the den of these swindlers. That would be a great feat, and the garrison will surely give you a good bonus, right? In this way, you not only do a good deed for Jianghai City, but also earn the milk powder money for your child. Isn't it a win-win situation?"</p><p></p><p>"Wow! Old Ye, you should join the garrison. Your brain is simply amazing. You'd be a great candidate for the garrison."</p><p></p><p>Ye Xiao shook his head.</p><p></p><p>"No, thanks. I'm not interested. I'm busy now, see you later."</p><p></p><p>"Okay, you go ahead. But when the baby is born, can you come to the hospital? Last time you helped me a lot, and Wanwan and I plan to make you the godfather of the child. Are you willing?"</p><p></p><p>Ye Xiao was stunned. Godfather? He hadn't even thought about it, he was still a child himself, and hadn't even had a relationship before, how could he be a godfather?</p><p>"I'll think about it, we'll see."</p><p></p><p>"Alright, I'll continue my patrol."</p><p></p><p>"Go ahead."</p><p></p><p>After parting ways, Ye Xiao set out on his own journey.</p><p></p><p>In the evening, a man and a cat arrived at a small town on the outskirts of Qinzhou - Luofeng City.</p><p></p><p>It was rumored that hundreds of years ago, a human expert had slain a phoenix-blooded star beast, a fire phoenix, in this place.</p><p></p><p>After the fire phoenix was killed, its blood power became the nourishment, sealed in Luofeng City, helping it absorb the spiritual energy of heaven and earth.</p><p></p><p>And the man and the cat were naturally Ye Xiao and his servant Huan Liuli.</p><p></p><p>According to the feedback from Ye Xiao's spiritual power, the last place Ji Feng disappeared was in this area, so the master and servant came here to search for Ji Feng.</p><p></p><p>"Master, have you found Ji Feng?" Huan Liuli couldn't help but ask, and Ye Xiao shook his head.</p><p></p><p>"The spiritual power I attached to her is in a hidden state. There are only two ways to trigger it.</p><p></p><p>One is when she activates her own power, my spiritual power will piggyback on her dispersed spiritual power to send a message.</p><p></p><p>The other is when I'm near her, my spiritual power will react to the detection of my power.</p><p></p><p>But when Ji Feng is not making any moves, the spiritual power will remain dormant.</p><p></p><p>This way, Ji Feng will never be able to discover the spiritual power. Naturally, she won't pay attention to it or remove it."</p><p></p><p>"Wow! Master, you are so wise, brilliant and intelligent!"</p><p></p><p>"Don't flatter me, it's fake!"</p><p></p><p>"Cough, cough. Master, then what should we do? If we can't find her in ten days, what then?"</p><p></p><p>"Don't worry, I noticed that the spiritual power transmission always happens at night. She must be active at night. When she releases her aura at night, I can immediately locate her and capture her and her accomplices."</p><p></p><p>"Master is so wise. Then what shall we do now?"</p><p></p><p>"First, let's take care of the important matters."</p><p></p><p>Ten minutes later, Ye Xiao was holding a bucket of spicy fried skewers, walking on the street and eating with Huan Liuli.</p><p></p><p>"Wow, the spicy fried skewers in Luofeng City are so delicious, much better than those in Jianghai City."</p><p></p><p>"Of course, every place has its own specialty food. Luofeng City excels at spicy and numbing flavors.</p><p></p><p>Look at the fried skewers in Jianghai City, they only have cumin powder and fried chili peppers.</p><p></p><p>But the Luofeng City's spicy fried skewers use the best Chuzhou Chaotian peppers, along with sesame and Sichuan peppercorn fried into a numbing and spicy oil. Not only is it fragrant, but the spicy and numbing sensation is unparalleled, truly the best spicy oil in the Nine Realms."</p><p></p><p>"Then I'll eat more of it."</p><p></p><p>"Do you have money?"</p><p></p><p>"Of course, I recently sold some stockings and earned a lot of money, around 70,000 to 80,000 yuan."</p><p></p><p>Ye Xiao: "(⊙⊙)!"</p><p></p><p>"How much did you say?"</p><p></p><p>"70,000 to 80,000 yuan!"</p><p></p><p>"Can you really earn that much from selling stockings? Are there so many people buying them?"</p><p></p><p>"Yes! The business is very good."</p><p></p><p>"But... that doesn't seem right? You've never sold your stockings before! The ones you're selling, whose are they?"</p>

        <h1>Chapter 327</h1>
        <div class="content">
            <p>Here is the full English translation of the Chinese novel excerpt:</p><p></p><p>The earth was instead shattered by them into several deep pits.</p><p></p><p>The earth was trembling, and the hearts of the people were shaken and unable to control themselves.</p><p></p><p>In this moment, Ye Xiao was a god! He was the number one powerhouse in the human world! The absolute number one powerhouse in the human world! Seeing that towering figure standing in front of the national gate, the crowd was filled with endless emotions.</p><p></p><p>Ye Xiao took in those few super divine beast stars, but this time, no beast stars fell from the sky.</p><p></p><p>The super divine beast stars across the world were far more than just these few. They were simply terrified, thoroughly terrified by Ye Xiao's strength!</p><p></p><p>Ye Xiao looked up at the clouds above, his sharp gaze able to see through the figures hiding behind the clouds.</p><p></p><p>"If you want to fight, then fight. Cowering and shrinking like a rat, is this the style of the super divine beast stars?"</p><p></p><p>As he spoke, the clouds began to churn.</p><p></p><p>Several auras were slowly approaching this way.</p><p></p><p>But at this moment, a thunderous roar suddenly rang out from the sky above.</p><p></p><p>It was like a warning, a command that caused all the beast stars preparing to attack to quickly retreat.</p><p></p><p>In an instant, all the oppressive pressure had completely disappeared.</p><p></p><p>Jiang Chen couldn't help but ask in puzzlement, "Did the beast stars retreat?"</p><p></p><p>Qinglong nodded.</p><p></p><p>"That's right, at least for now."</p><p></p><p>The crowd's faces were filled with joy.</p><p></p><p>"Good! Ye Xiao is truly remarkable! I knew he could do it."</p><p></p><p>"This kid, I can't help but start to worship him."</p><p></p><p>Qinglong slowly spoke:</p><p></p><p>"But you all just said you wanted me to go help."</p><p></p><p>The crowd smiled awkwardly.</p><p></p><p>Afterwards, Jiang Chen shouted to the back:</p><p></p><p>"All warriors, retreat to your respective areas and stand by."</p><p></p><p>As soon as he finished speaking, the crowd began to speculate in disbelief.</p><p></p><p>"Did the beast stars retreat?"</p><p>"Senior Sword Immortal has driven away the beast stars!"</p><p>"We won!"</p><p>"We don't have to die!"</p><p>"Long live Senior Sword Immortal!"</p><p>"Long live!"</p><p></p><p>After fully understanding, the crowd began to cheer excitedly. They were so excited.</p><p></p><p>After all, even if this beast calamity was not the extremely destructive kind, but just a regular one, in the past, the human tribes of the Nine Provinces did not know how many people they would have to sacrifice. But this super powerful beast calamity had directly wiped out all the other provinces except the Nine Provinces! Yet the Nine Provinces did not lose a single person.</p><p></p><p>This was such an enormous stroke of luck! And all of this was thanks to that one person guarding the national gate - Senior Sword Immortal!</p><p></p><p>It was he who, with his own strength, slew eight super divine realm experts comparable to the human emperor realm, and annihilated wave after wave of beast stars!</p><p></p><p>So the people's heartfelt gratitude towards him was beyond words.</p><p></p><p>Qinglong and the others came to Ye Xiao's side and spoke again:</p><p></p><p>"Ye Xiao, you've worked hard."</p><p></p><p>Ye Xiao shook his head.</p><p></p><p>"It's nothing, I'm just doing what I'm capable of!"</p><p></p><p>"For you, it may be something you're capable of, or even insignificant. But for us, it is a lifetime of unending gratitude."</p><p></p><p>"Senior, you're too kind. Besides, it's still too early to say thank you."</p><p></p><p>After a pause, he continued:</p><p></p><p>"The divine blood extracted by the other provinces is so vast, creating super divine realm beast stars far more than just these eight.</p><p></p><p>And there are also the hidden hands behind them, we don't know who they are.</p><p></p><p>Our future has many enemies, and there are many things we need to be vigilant about in the future!"</p><p></p><p>The crowd nodded.</p><p></p><p>"Super experts are everywhere, and there are also the old-school super divine ones in the starry sky, their strength must be dozens of times stronger than these newly broken through super divine realm experts! I hope we can hold on."</p><p></p><p>The crowd gradually retreated, and the warriors also began to disperse, but Ye Xiao remained with the four seniors.</p><p></p><p>"Senior four, now that the human tribes in the rest of the world have been almost completely wiped out by the beast stars, there's no need for the starry sky battlefield to exist anymore.</p><p></p><p>If possible, I suggest withdrawing the human warriors from the starry sky battlefield.</p><p></p><p>The human warriors on the starry sky battlefield are actually several times stronger than the ones on the ground.</p><p></p><p>With them here, we can ensure we win this arduous protracted war."</p><p></p><p>The four seniors nodded.</p><p></p><p>"What you said does make some sense. However, this still requires us to communicate with the starry sky battlefield.</p><p></p><p>The starry sky battlefield is independent and superior to the ground world.</p><p></p><p>Only the starry sky battlefield can issue orders to the ground, but the ground cannot issue orders to the starry sky battlefield."</p><p></p><p>"Then hurry up and do it. Dividing the troops in two is ultimately not a good solution. If we're ambushed separately, it could be a big trouble."</p><p></p><p>Ye Xiao sighed softly.</p><p></p><p>For some reason, even though the beast stars had all left, he had a vague feeling that something was not quite right.</p><p></p><p>After reaching the emperor realm, his sixth sense had also improved significantly.</p><p></p><p>Many times when he had this kind of feeling, it was not unfounded, and it would inevitably lead to some unimaginable tragic events!</p><p></p><p>After the others left, Ye Xiao returned to the Jianghai City.</p><p></p><p>He looked at his phone, which had quite a few missed calls.</p><p></p><p>Here is my translation of the Chinese excerpt:</p><p></p><p>Electricity.</p><p></p><p>There was Gu Hai's, Yang Qi's, the librarian's, and even Liu Chengxun's and Park Jiansheng's.</p><p></p><p>However, as soon as Ye Xiao returned to Jianghai City, a figure quickly rushed over to him.</p><p></p><p>It was Liu Chengxun. He came to Ye Xiao's side, looking very excited.</p><p></p><p>"Ye."</p><p></p><p>He was just about to call out Ye Xiao's name, but quickly stopped and cupped his hands towards Ye Xiao, saying, "Liu Chengxun, pays respects to the Sword Immortal!"</p><p></p><p>Ye Xiao smiled wordlessly.</p><p></p><p>"Old Liu, there's no need to be so formal. I'm not too concerned about that identity. Just treat me the same as before."</p><p></p><p>Liu Chengxun nodded, but his expression was still a bit stiff.</p><p></p><p>"I'm still getting used to it for the moment. Let me get used to it first before we talk.</p><p></p><p>The Sword Immortal senior I've always wanted to meet is right beside me.</p><p></p><p>I suddenly feel like such an idiot. I didn't notice at all..."</p><p></p><p>Ye Xiao smiled.</p><p></p><p>"If I let you easily detect it, would I still be the Sword Immortal?"</p><p></p><p>Liu Chengxun slapped his forehead.</p><p></p><p>"You're right, my brain is just getting dumber and dumber."</p><p></p><p>"By the way, how did you get back here?"</p><p></p><p>"The Hanzhou side has already fallen, there are only a tiny number of Hanzhou people left, and I really couldn't help them anymore, so I had to come back first.</p><p></p><p>I've already repaid them for their years of nurturing.</p><p></p><p>If it weren't for that sword beam you gave me, I might have already sacrificed myself for Hanzhou.</p><p></p><p>Speaking of this, I really have to thank you!"</p><p></p><p>"No need to be polite. Your previous help for Jianghai City can be considered my way of thanking you."</p><p></p><p>Liu Chengxun chuckled.</p><p></p><p>"That won't do! I was the one you saved, I can't just let it go like that. Come, let me treat you to a meal."</p><p></p><p>Ye Xiao nodded.</p><p></p><p>At this moment, his phone rang again, it was Gu Hai's call.</p><p></p><p>"Hello!"</p><p></p><p>"Uh... Old... Hmm, no, Senior Ye! Is this Senior Ye?"</p><p></p><p>Gu Hai seemed to have searched for a while before finding a more suitable term.</p><p></p><p>Ye Xiao smiled helplessly.</p><p></p><p>"Enough with the long-winded nonsense, tell me, what do you want?"</p><p></p><p>"I want to see you."</p><p></p><p>"Okay, I'm going to have a meal with Old Liu, I'll call you when we find a place."</p><p></p><p>"Alright!"</p><p></p><p>More than half an hour later, the three of them gathered in a hot pot restaurant in Jianghai City, and booked a private room.</p><p></p><p>Gu Hai came in a hurry, wearing a suit, looking very formal, but perhaps because he rode an electric scooter over, his hair was messy and looked a bit strange.</p><p></p><p>"What are you dressing so formally for at this late hour? It's like you're going on a blind date."</p><p></p><p>Gu Hai's face flushed slightly.</p><p></p><p>"I was just thinking that I should come to receive you, this great hero of the human race, so I dressed up a bit more formally.</p><p></p><p>I definitely have to give you enough etiquette and respect."</p><p></p><p>Liu Chengxun interjected:</p><p></p><p>"Ye Xiao doesn't like it when people do this kind of thing. Just be your normal self."</p><p></p><p>Gu Hai waved his hand.</p><p></p><p>"No, no, no, you're a Korean, what do you know? This is our great hero of the Nine Realms, not your Hanzhou hero, so of course you don't understand my feelings."</p><p></p><p>Liu Chengxun shook his head.</p><p></p><p>"You're wrong there. Ye Xiao is not only the great hero of the Nine Realms, but also the great hero of the human race!"</p><p></p><p>"But first he has to be the hero of our Jianghai City!"</p><p></p><p>"The migrants don't count."</p><p></p><p>"I've already moved back here."</p><p></p><p>Ye Xiao watched the two of them bickering, quite speechless.</p><p></p><p>"You two, don't argue here, okay? One-fifth of the human race has already died, you two can't even calm down a bit."</p><p></p><p>The two of them finally stopped.</p><p></p><p>Gu Hai served Ye Xiao a lot of beef.</p><p></p><p>"Ye Xiao, eat the beef. You just had such a big victory, you must be starving, right? Hurry up and eat something to replenish yourself."</p><p></p><p>Liu Chengxun said in a low voice:</p><p></p><p>"He's already at the Emperor Realm, what can beef do to replenish him?"</p><p></p><p>Gu Hai glared at him.</p><p></p><p>"Why are you so talkative? This is me welcoming and refreshing Ye Xiao, it has special meaning, do you understand? You Korean, oh no, Hanzhou is gone now, you're at most just a fool now."</p><p></p><p>Liu Chengxun didn't bother arguing with him, and now that he had survived the disaster, he was thinking more broadly, slowly savoring the wine and food.</p><p></p><p>Gu Hai kept serving dishes to Ye Xiao while saying:</p><p></p><p>"Ye Xiao, were those times when you saved me before all you? I was puzzled before, I didn't know the Sword Immortal, how could he have come to save me? Now that I think about it, I'm really an idiot!</p><p>The Sword Immortal must have known me, right?"</p><p></p><p>Ye Xiao slowly spoke:</p><p></p><p>"Regarding my identity, I don't want to overly expose it to others. You two know, and that's enough, don't tell the people around you."</p>

        <h1>Chapter 349</h1>
        <div class="content">
            <p>Here is the full English translation of the Chinese excerpt:</p><p></p><p>He felt his mind was a bit overwhelmed at the moment.</p><p></p><p>These were all the ancestors of the human race, and they were all powerful experts at the Divine Realm in their lifetimes!</p><p></p><p>How could their souls not be able to withstand the pressure of his divine soul?</p><p></p><p>Although Ye Xiao knew the divine soul of the Golden Book was formidable, and it had just been tempered by his one hundred and eight dragon breaths, he never expected the divine soul of the Golden Book to be this powerful!</p><p></p><p>"My soul body is about to collapse. Kid, quickly withdraw it."</p><p></p><p>"Hurry! We can't hold on much longer."</p><p></p><p>Ye Xiao immediately withdrew his divine soul, and several ancestral souls finally breathed a sigh of relief, barely managing to get up from the ground. Their bodies were still trembling, and their eyes were filled with deep fear.</p><p></p><p>"What a terrifying divine soul! Your divine soul has become so powerful that it instills a sense of terror in us, Divine Realm experts. What exactly is your divine soul?"</p><p></p><p>Ye Xiao replied with some confusion, "Didn't you see it just now?"</p><p></p><p>"I couldn't see it clearly just now. I vaguely saw a book corner, but in the blink of an eye, it had already suppressed us. We Divine Realm experts have already completely integrated our souls into our spiritual bodies.</p><p></p><p>So if your spiritual body or divine soul is too powerful or high in rank, it will exert a suppressive force on us."</p><p></p><p>"It is indeed a book."</p><p></p><p>"No matter what kind of divine soul it is, its power far exceeds our imagination.</p><p></p><p>I never expected that we would have a descendant like you. Heaven has blessed us! Our clan is finally about to produce a dragon!"</p><p></p><p>The souls of the ancestors were extremely excited, and some even became a little frenzied.</p><p></p><p>Ye Xiao felt a bit embarrassed by the praise from the ancestors and couldn't help but speak up:</p><p></p><p>"Strictly speaking, I'm not the strongest in this lineage. More than two thousand years ago, there was someone even stronger than me. He broke through the starry battlefield and entered the starry sky."</p><p></p><p>"Oh? Our lineage has actually produced such a talented genius! Hahaha, truly blessed by the heavens."</p><p></p><p>After being excited for a long time, one of the ancestors finally couldn't help but speak up:</p><p></p><p>"Child, the reason you haven't been able to advance to the Divine Realm is that your physical body is too weak.</p><p></p><p>It's true that you have already cultivated your physical body to perfection, but compared to your divine soul, it is simply too incompatible.</p><p></p><p>If you want to advance to higher realms, you must enhance the divine blood within your body. The divine blood you have now is only 120,000 drops, which is just the normal amount for a divine clan.</p><p></p><p>But it is far from enough to match your divine soul. You need more divine blood to achieve the fusion of divine blood and divine soul, and successfully advance to the Divine Realm!"</p><p></p><p>"Although the process is difficult, if you can advance to the Divine Realm, you will be far stronger than ordinary Divine Realm experts, and you will be able to go even further in the future."</p><p></p><p>Ye Xiao nodded.</p><p></p><p>Knowing that he could continue to break through, his heart felt much more at ease.</p><p></p><p>Previously, when he saw that there was no reaction after tempering his divine soul, he had been somewhat worried in his heart. Now that he knew the root of the problem, everything had become clear.</p><p></p><p>"By the way, child, have you told anyone about your divine soul or shown it to others?"</p><p></p><p>Ye Xiao shook his head.</p><p></p><p>The ancestors nodded and also felt relieved.</p><p></p><p>"Listen to us, having this divine soul is an extremely rare occurrence in thousands of years. You must never casually reveal it to anyone, or else it may bring you great danger."</p><p></p><p>"That's right, even within the XuanYuan Clan, there may be people who will be tempted. You must know that your divine soul is truly too powerful.</p><p></p><p>If any of the powerful experts in the clan want to seize it and take it away to give to their own descendants, then you will be in grave peril!"</p><p></p><p>"Don't worry, ancestors, I do have some understanding of this."</p><p></p><p>"That's good."</p><p></p><p>One of the ancestors who seemed to have the most noble status stood up and spoke:</p><p></p><p>"In the past, our branch was just an ordinary one in the XuanYuan Clan, with only a few dozen members. Due to our poor aptitude, we did not receive much resource allocation from the clan.</p><p></p><p>Of course, this is not the fault of the Xuanyuan Clan. Any race must prioritize the elites, only in this way can they ensure the continuation of the entire race.</p><p></p><p>If a race cannot constantly produce powerful experts, once the Divine Emperor bloodline declines, the impact on the entire race will be huge!"</p><p></p><p>"But we were not satisfied with just sinking into oblivion. In order to give our descendants, that is, you, a better future, our entire family has been wandering in the starry sky, and after much confirmation, we finally found this human world."</p><p></p><p>"This treasure trove, what exactly is it?"</p><p></p><p>"A divine national treasure vault!"</p><p></p><p>Ye Xiao's pupils immediately shrank.</p><p></p><p>A divine national treasure vault!</p><p></p><p>He had seen it in the library before.</p><p></p><p>The so-called divine nation is a realm established by a Divine Emperor to consolidate his power in the starry sky.</p><p></p><p>Its scale can be large or small, but even the smallest divine nation has formidable overall strength, and the treasures within are countless.</p><p></p><p>And the divine national treasure vault is naturally the storage place for these treasures.</p><p></p><p>Here is the full English translation of the Chinese excerpt:</p><p></p><p>The Place of the National Treasure</p><p></p><p>"You're saying that in this vast starry domain, there was once an ancient divine kingdom long ago."</p><p></p><p>"That's right. As time passed, it has long since disappeared into the annals of history. But its treasure trove has not been lost, hidden somewhere in this world.</p><p></p><p>Because the treasures in that trove are so powerful that they even gave birth to a dragon vein outside of it - the progenitor of all dragon veins in this world, the Kunlun Dragon Vein. All the dragon veins in this world were nurtured by it."</p><p></p><p>Ye Xiao was shocked.</p><p></p><p>No wonder it was the treasure trove of a divine kingdom, it must contain numerous priceless treasures.</p><p></p><p>To have even given birth to the progenitor of all dragon veins is truly astonishing.</p><p></p><p>One must know that even a single White Dragon Vein is already incredibly remarkable. Yet the White Dragon Vein does not even rank among the top three in the Nine Provinces, let alone how many dragon veins exist in the entire world? All of these dragon veins were created by the Progenitor of the Ten Thousand Dragons - just how powerful must the Kunlun Dragon Vein be? If he could find that dragon vein, wouldn't that mean he could obtain all the treasures within?</p><p></p><p>The ancestral figures of the human race seemed to have discerned Ye Xiao's thoughts, and chuckled, "As you've surmised, our intention is for you to rely on the divine kingdom's treasure trove to greatly enhance your strength, break free of your shackles, and become an exceptionally powerful lineage within the Xuanyuan Godly Tribe.</p><p></p><p>Thereafter, you will be able to stand firm within the Xuanyuan Godly Tribe, no longer just a mere ant whose fate is not in its own hands."</p><p></p><p>Ye Xiao nodded.</p><p></p><p>Although these human ancestral figures had only casually mentioned a few things, he could imagine the hardships they had endured, wandering the vast starry skies for many years.</p><p></p><p>No wonder the various tribes of the Nine Provinces have been passing down their legacy through the generations.</p><p></p><p>The esteemed ancestors have left behind the experiences and achievements they arduously cultivated, for their descendants to inherit and carry forward.</p><p></p><p>Truly remarkable!</p><p></p><p>"Do the venerable ancestors know the location of the Kunlun Dragon Vein?"</p><p></p><p>The ancestral figures shook their heads.</p><p></p><p>"Regrettably, we have encountered the Kunlun Dragon Vein before, but it has evolved an extremely high level of intelligence due to the immense power it contains.</p><p></p><p>Until our dying day, we were never able to find it again."</p><p></p><p>Ye Xiao shook his head and sighed.</p><p></p><p>But upon further thought, the Kunlun Dragon Vein was so formidable - if it was easily obtained, it would not be so valuable.</p><p></p><p>"By the way, how is the situation outside now? Have you driven away those star beasts? Are they still harassing you?"</p><p></p><p>One of the ancestral figures couldn't help but ask.</p><p></p><p>Ye Xiao then spoke:</p><p></p><p>"Over the years of our development, as our bloodline has declined, our martial dao cultivation has also been constantly regressing.</p><p></p><p>Two years ago, we were nearly wiped out. The other human tribes in this world have all been exterminated by the star beasts.</p><p></p><p>In the end, I and some elders managed to turn the tide, defeating the star beasts.</p><p></p><p>However, we had no choice but to summon people from the Xuanyuan Godly Tribe to come here."</p><p></p><p>The expressions of the group immediately darkened.</p><p></p><p>"Has the Xuanyuan Godly Tribe already sent people here?"</p><p></p><p>"Alas, it's fate! We originally didn't want to notify the Xuanyuan Godly Tribe, as we wanted to monopolize that divine kingdom relic for ourselves.</p><p></p><p>Who would have thought they would still end up coming in the end."</p><p></p><p>"Actually, venerable ancestors, you don't need to be too worried. The ones from the Xuanyuan Godly Tribe who have come are not that strong, the highest only at the Emperor Realm 64th Dragon.</p><p></p><p>We still have some hope."</p><p></p><p>Their eyes lit up.</p><p></p><p>"Really? That's great! With your talent, if you put in some extra effort to further improve your strength, you should have a good chance of finding the Kunlun Dragon Vein."</p><p></p><p>Ye Xiao nodded.</p><p></p><p>"I will work hard."</p><p></p><p>The human ancestral figures exchanged glances, as if they had made an important decision.</p><p></p><p>"Fellow ancestors, the divine kingdom's treasure trove is something we've painstakingly uncovered. If we can obtain it, it will benefit our descendants for generations to come!</p><p></p><p>Perhaps now is the time for us to provide one more assistance to our offspring."</p><p></p><p>"Correct. We've been waiting here for so many years, just for the arrival of someone worthy of seeking the divine kingdom's treasure trove.</p><p></p><p>Now that this child has come before us, what are we still waiting for?"</p><p></p><p>The gazes of the group gradually became resolute. Soon, the air distorted, and twenty-three white jade coffins were summoned forth.</p><p></p><p>Lying inside were the remains of the twenty-three ancestral figures.</p><p></p><p>Ye Xiao had already guessed what was coming.</p><p></p><p>"Venerable ancestors, you must not!"</p><p></p><p>The group smiled faintly.</p><p></p><p>"Why not? We're already dead, our corpses are of no use. The divine blood within us is diminishing day by day, and will eventually be completely exhausted. Rather than that, why not give all our divine blood to you, to help you ascend to the Divine Realm?"</p>

        <h1>Chapter 205</h1>
        <div class="content">
            <p>Here is the full English translation of the Chinese excerpt:</p><p></p><p>The Buddha Palm, although an extremely hard and yang-dominant attack technique, also has some wonderful applications. If one were to slightly slow down the release, it could become a method of saving people.</p><p></p><p>The application of a technique completely depends on the intent and methods of the one releasing it. </p><p></p><p>However, slowing down the release is actually more troublesome than just releasing it.</p><p></p><p>This is because releasing an attack is just a momentary strike, which consumes a very limited amount of energy.</p><p></p><p>But for Ye Xiao to slow it down, it requires a continuous output of spiritual energy, consuming far more spiritual energy than a single attack.</p><p></p><p>Fortunately, Ye Xiao has now advanced to a Xiantian Ninth Rank expert, with a vast sea of spiritual energy within him, many times more than before.</p><p></p><p>So he can easily release a massive amount of spiritual energy.</p><p></p><p>After the mountain was temporarily stabilized, Ye Xiao calmly spoke:</p><p></p><p>"Although I have temporarily fixed the mountain, the structures have still been damaged, so it won't be long before they collapse again. You all should quickly flee this place."</p><p></p><p>As soon as he finished speaking, without waiting for the others to respond, Ye Xiao turned on his heel and vanished from the spot.</p><p></p><p>Seeing Ye Xiao disappear instantly, as if he had vanished into thin air, Huang Tao and the others couldn't help but exclaim in admiration, "He is truly a divine being! His speed and methods are equally extraordinary."</p><p></p><p>Meanwhile, in the city of Jianghai, Long Tu finally shifted his gaze to Liu Chengxun.</p><p></p><p>"Since you have shown such courage, I'll let you strike first."</p><p></p><p>Long Tu didn't take Liu Chengxun seriously, which is why he allowed him to attack first.</p><p></p><p>Because in his eyes, whether Liu Chengxun struck first or last, the result would be the same - he would lose, and perhaps even die.</p><p></p><p>But if Long Tu struck first, there would be no fun in it.</p><p></p><p>Liu Chengxun would be instantly defeated by a single attack.</p><p></p><p>Before that so-called Immortal of Swords came out, he didn't want to make this little entertainment too boring.</p><p></p><p>Liu Chengxun took a deep breath and cupped his hands towards Long Tu, saying, "Thank you, senior, for the opportunity."</p><p></p><p>He then took out his longsword from his storage ring, raised it high above his head, and began to focus his mind.</p><p></p><p>The power of the Dao of the Sword erupted wildly within him, finally condensing into a radiant sword beam that extended thousands of feet!</p><p></p><p>This was his full-power strike, an imitation of the sword technique Ye Xiao had used to defeat him earlier.</p><p></p><p>Although it was not as powerful as Ye Xiao's, it was still far stronger than any of his previous techniques.</p><p></p><p>With the appearance of Liu Chengxun's sword beam, the surrounding spiritual energy was disrupted, forming a towering vortex, as the forces rapidly converged and compressed towards it.</p><p></p><p>Luo Xinling and Lian Chimu exchanged a glance, their eyes shining.</p><p></p><p>"What a powerful technique."</p><p></p><p>"I didn't expect Liu Chengxun to have grown so much stronger! He's far more powerful than when he was ranked 49th on the Dragon Ranking."</p><p></p><p>"It seems he has gained a lot of insights after the previous battle, and his strength has now surpassed his original foundation."</p><p></p><p>"If that's the case, perhaps this strike really has a chance!"</p><p></p><p>The two were greatly excited.</p><p></p><p>Because for someone like Long Tu, he would not stoop to lies and deception. Their pride and integrity were the most fundamental principles for such powerful experts.</p><p></p><p>As long as Liu Chengxun could withstand Long Tu's first strike, it would count as a victory.</p><p></p><p>In that case, the crisis in Jianghai City should be resolved.</p><p></p><p>One second.</p><p>Two seconds. </p><p>Three seconds.</p><p></p><p>Finally, Liu Chengxun struck.</p><p></p><p>He let out a loud roar and swung his longsword with all his might, hoping this strike could overcome Long Tu's attack.</p><p></p><p>The sword beam moved, and the clouds and wind parted.</p><p></p><p>The surrounding spiritual energy rapidly dispersed to the sides, forming a vacuum zone, and the sword light even created sparks of lightning as it rubbed against the spiritual energy in the air.</p><p></p><p>This strike was witnessed by all the people in Jianghai City.</p><p></p><p>This strike was as powerful as a divine technique!</p><p>This strike carried the hopes of so many people.</p><p></p><p>Everyone eagerly anticipated this strike, hoping it would bring them a pleasant surprise.</p><p></p><p>The speed of the sword beam was actually quite fast, reaching Long Tu in just a second.</p><p></p><p>But Long Tu remained completely calm, allowing the strike to hit him directly.</p><p></p><p>Boom! The massive explosive force and shockwave instantly tore apart the black clouds in the sky.</p><p></p><p>Dazzling light flashed, radiating thousands of feet, brighter than the sun itself.</p><p></p><p>The tremendous impact and explosion even caused a painful ringing in everyone's ears.</p><p></p><p>The stronger the sword beam's power, the more excited the onlookers became.</p><p></p><p>He did it!</p><p>Such a powerful attack, it must have succeeded!</p><p></p><p>Long Tu hadn't even made a move yet. When he did, he would be at a disadvantage against Liu Chengxun's peak state.</p><p>As long as Liu Chengxun could withstand Long Tu's first strike, Jianghai City would have won.</p><p></p><p>But as the light from the explosion faded, everyone was petrified, dumbfounded, even despairing.</p><p></p><p>"You've got to be kidding me?"</p><p>"Damn it!"</p><p>"How can he be so strong?"</p><p>"How can we possibly defeat him? Looks like all we can do is surrender."</p><p></p><p>In the sky, Liu Chengxun's powerful strike had slammed down onto Long Tu's head...</p><p></p><p>Here is the full English translation of the Chinese excerpt:</p><p></p><p>But, just a few inches from his forehead, it suddenly stopped, unable to advance even a millimeter further.</p><p></p><p>"That's it?"</p><p></p><p>A trace of sarcasm flashed in Dragon Slayer's eyes. Then, he made his move.</p><p></p><p>No fancy techniques, just a simple, straightforward punch.</p><p></p><p>Before the punch even landed, Liu Chengxun's sword light had already begun to shatter into countless cracks.</p><p></p><p>Crack, crack.</p><p></p><p>And when Dragon Slayer's fist fully connected with Liu Chengxun's sword beam, the sword beam was directly and vividly shattered.</p><p></p><p>Defeated like a mountain collapsing! Liu Chengxun's sword beam shattered piece by piece.</p><p></p><p>Dragon Slayer's punch came crashing down towards his head.</p><p></p><p>In just half a second, it reached the top of Liu Chengxun's head.</p><p></p><p>Liu Chengxun immediately slashed out a sword to block it.</p><p></p><p>But unfortunately, he was no match for his opponent.</p><p></p><p>That sword strike was like a child's play, as soon as it touched the opponent's punch, it directly broke apart.</p><p></p><p>Then the punch directly struck Liu Chengxun's long sword.</p><p></p><p>Boom! Accompanied by a violent explosion, Liu Chengxun's imperial sword was shattered, and the fragments pierced through Liu Chengxun's body like bullets.</p><p></p><p>Even though Liu Chengxun was a Saint-Emperor, his body had been strengthened to a terrifying degree, but he could not withstand the hardness of the imperial sword fragments.</p><p></p><p>Not to mention these imperial sword fragments were propelled by an ultimate divine punch.</p><p></p><p>Blood spurted out from Liu Chengxun's body, extremely tragic.</p><p></p><p>Not only that, the punch then arrived, crushing all the bones in Liu Chengxun's body, like cannon shells, violently striking the ground of Jianghai City.</p><p></p><p>He fell from the top of a hundred-meter-tall skyscraper, all the way to the ground.</p><p></p><p>Boom! The huge impact force even caused the entire skyscraper to collapse directly.</p><p></p><p>Too terrifying, this earth-shattering power made all the people in Jianghai City utterly desperate.</p><p></p><p>It's over!</p><p></p><p>This time it's really over.</p><p></p><p>Even a Saint-Emperor at the Innate Eighth Rank was just an ant before him.</p><p></p><p>Then they, who were inferior to the Innate Eighth Rank, were not even ants in the face of Dragon Slayer, right? Despair!</p><p></p><p>Deep despair, like the dark clouds covering the sky, shrouded the hearts of every single person.</p><p></p><p>Are we all going to die?</p><p></p><p>In the sky above, there was no trace of sarcasm in Dragon Slayer's eyes.</p><p></p><p>He had already predicted this situation long ago.</p><p></p><p>Liu Chengxun was not his opponent at all.</p><p></p><p>Wanting to bet with him, using this little bit of cleverness to stop him, was simply laughable, couldn't be more laughable.</p><p></p><p>Seventy years! A full seventy years of seclusion, he was no longer the Dragon Slayer of the past.</p><p></p><p>Now he was a supreme expert at the peak of the Innate Ninth Rank, a god towering above the mortal world!</p><p></p><p>These people were not even qualified to oppose him, they were all ants before him.</p><p></p><p>His current target was only one person. That was Sword Saint Li Liushui.</p><p></p><p>Aside from him, he didn't care about any other person.</p><p></p><p>Liu Chengxun was like this, Jianghai City was like this, the Nine Provinces were like this, and that so-called Sword Saint was even more so!</p><p></p><p>"Forget it! If I keep dragging this on, it's just a waste of my time.</p><p></p><p>It seems I've overestimated that Sword Saint.</p><p></p><p>A coward who doesn't even dare to come out, not even worth me personally dealing with.</p><p></p><p>He's not even as good as this little Liu Chengxun! Trash!"</p><p></p><p>With that, he slowly raised his hand, and the boundless spiritual energy of the Innate Ninth Rank erupted, causing the dark clouds in the sky to start twisting and converging.</p><p></p><p>Luo Xinling and Lian Chiming's faces turned grim, revealing a sense of despair.</p><p></p><p>They understood that Dragon Slayer no longer wanted to wait.</p><p></p><p>He was going to directly destroy the entire Jianghai City.</p><p></p><p>Sending the millions of people here, along with Jianghai City, up to the heavens.</p><p></p><p>Sword Saint senior!</p><p></p><p>What are you doing? If you don't come out again, Jianghai City will be completely ruined!</p><p></p><p>Everyone was in the depths of despair.</p><p></p><p>At this moment, Fa Zheng, who was fighting the star beasts, suddenly seemed to sense something.</p><p></p><p>He smashed a half-beast in front of him with a punch, then raised his head to look up at the sky.</p><p></p><p>In the dense black clouds, there seemed to be an extremely familiar energy rapidly approaching.</p><p></p><p>It was the power of the Buddhist Dharma!</p><p></p><p>It's the Buddha!</p><p></p><p>An extremely powerful Buddhist force was rapidly approaching.</p><p></p><p>Was it a Buddhist expert who had arrived? </p><p></p><p>Which Buddhist expert was it? How come he had never felt this aura in all these years at Shaolin?</p><p></p><p>Tian Zhu Fozi Aro also seemed to sense something. His body trembled, and he immediately looked up at the sky excitedly.</p><p></p><p>"It's him! It's him who has come!</p><p></p><p>This feeling is absolutely certain.</p><p></p><p>After thirty-six years! Thirty-six years of waiting, searching, it's him!"</p>

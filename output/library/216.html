        <h1>Chapter 216</h1>
        <div class="content">
            <p>Here is the full English translation of the Chinese excerpt:</p><p></p><p>Although he was not entirely sure how powerful the Sword Deity Li Liushui was, he had encountered the world's 10th ranked Luo Qingshan before.</p><p></p><p>There were two encounters - one was with his sword intent clone, and the other was with Luo Qingshan's true body coming to Jianghai City.</p><p></p><p>The first time, Ye Xiao realized how powerful the other was.</p><p></p><p>The second time, when Ye Xiao was at the Innate Eighth Rank, he unleashed the Taixuan Tiangong technique, which even caught the other's attention and almost got him discovered.</p><p></p><p>And the Sword Deity Li Liushui's ranking on the Dragon Ranking was one place higher than him.</p><p></p><p>So Li Liushui was at least a little bit stronger than him.</p><p></p><p>But even so, he had still gone mad.</p><p></p><p>This shows how difficult it is to break through to the King Realm.</p><p></p><p>It seems he must hurry and find a way to refine his soul.</p><p></p><p>Otherwise, when he breaks through to the King Realm, if he goes mad and starts indiscriminately killing innocents, he will surely be annihilated by the Nine Provinces.</p><p></p><p>And with his current strength, he could easily destroy a city with just a few moves. There are probably not many in the Nine Provinces who could resist him.</p><p></p><p>How many innocent people would he have to kill? Millions? Tens of millions? Even hundreds of millions? This is something Ye Xiao cannot accept.</p><p></p><p>Killing spirit beasts is fine, since they are the mortal enemies of humanity, and Ye Xiao sees them as just mutated animals.</p><p></p><p>On the other side, in the forbidden area behind the Shaolin Martial Arts Academy, the atmosphere was extremely oppressive.</p><p></p><p>Nearly all of Shaolin's high monks had gathered here, gazing solemnly at a deep well in front of them.</p><p></p><p>From the well mouth, surges of crimson demonic qi were continuously rising.</p><p></p><p>The essence of demonic qi is the outpouring of one's own blood qi, combined with murderous intent, forming an extremely yin and evil, heavily malicious power.</p><p></p><p>Its harm to normal life is extremely severe! Because the blood qi contains spiritual energy, and the murderous intent is the condensation of spiritual power.</p><p></p><p>When the two are fused, the damage to both the physical body and the soul is comprehensive.</p><p></p><p>Unlike normal attacks, which are mostly focused on harming the physical body.</p><p></p><p>"The demonic qi around the Sword Deity is becoming more and more dense. At this rate, he may not last much longer."</p><p></p><p>"I never expected the Sword Deity's demonic qi and murderous intent to be so strong! Even the demonic cultivators and peak spirit beast experts Shaolin has encountered in the past centuries are no match for him!"</p><p></p><p>"The Sword Deity cultivates the Dao of the Sword, and the sword inherently has the most killing aura among all martial arts."</p><p></p><p>"Have all the disciples above the Sect Master level from Shaolin's branches been summoned back?"</p><p></p><p>"The summons have been sent out, but since they are scattered so widely, we don't know if they can all arrive within a day."</p><p></p><p>The Shaolin Martial Arts Academy's Abbot stared intently at the well mouth continuously emitting demonic qi.</p><p></p><p>"Li Liushui is an extremely important expert in the Nine Provinces, he absolutely cannot have any accidents, otherwise it would be a huge loss for the Nine Provinces, even the entire world.</p><p></p><p>We must quickly gather Shaolin's Sect Master-level experts, set up formations, chant sutras, and use the most virtuous, pure, firm and yang spiritual power of our Buddhist sect to help stabilize his soul and pull him back to the right path."</p><p></p><p>"Yes!"</p><p></p><p>But just as the words left their mouths, the next moment, a blood-red light suddenly erupted from the well mouth.</p><p></p><p>"Killâ€”!"</p><p></p><p>Accompanied by a heaven-shaking roar, the clouds in the sky rapidly condensed and began to violently churn.</p><p></p><p>Then a sword beam burst out from the well, directly slicing open a large gap in the black clouds above.</p><p></p><p>Countless lightning bolts fell frantically, as if roaring and scolding Li Liushui's actions.</p><p></p><p>The Shaolin high monks' expressions changed drastically.</p><p></p><p>"Quick, use the Bodhi Sutra to purify the Sword Deity's killing intent."</p><p></p><p>At the Abbot's order, the crowd immediately acted, with countless golden lights surging out from their bodies and pouring into the well.</p><p></p><p>This managed to suppress the demonic qi inside, making the situation slightly better.</p><p></p><p>The crowd let out a reluctant sigh of relief.</p><p></p><p>However, what they didn't notice was that, accompanying the falling lightning, a tower forest in the distance had also suffered no small attack.</p><p></p><p>Boom boom boom. Several lightning bolts had directly struck a few of the towers.</p><p></p><p>The lightning destroyed the Buddhist scripture seals on the towers, causing them to explode.</p><p></p><p>Evil light burst forth.</p><p></p><p>But since all the Shaolin high monks were gathered around Li Liushui, there was no one here to suppress it.</p><p></p><p>"Hahaha, we've finally escaped!" </p><p></p><p>Accompanied by a sinister laugh, several beams of evil light rapidly shot out from the towers, rushing out of Shaolin.</p><p></p><p>On Li Liushui's side, one high monk couldn't help but ask the Abbot anxiously, "Abbot, several Ninth Rank spirit beasts from the Seventy-Two Demon Caverns have escaped. What do we do?"</p><p></p><p>The Abbot gritted his teeth.</p><p></p><p>"Never mind them, stabilizing Li Liushui is the priority. As long as we can save him, those mere Ninth Rank spirit beasts, he can help us capture them again."</p><p></p><p>As for those beams of evil light that escaped Shaolin, they quickly gathered in a mountain forest hundreds of miles away.</p><p></p><p>"Hahaha, after three hundred years, we're finally free!"</p><p></p><p>Here is the full English translation of the Chinese excerpt:</p><p></p><p>"After three hundred years, the Venerable One has finally escaped. "Is this the outside air? It's still as fresh as it was hundreds of years ago!"</p><p></p><p>Several star beasts were all immersed in the joy of liberation.</p><p></p><p>However, they soon regained their senses.</p><p></p><p>"The reason we were able to escape this time is mainly because the Dao God of the human race, Li Liushui, went mad, which gave us this opportunity.</p><p></p><p>But once the bunch of bald donkeys from Shaolin have dealt with Li Liushui, they will definitely come after us again."</p><p></p><p>"Well said. This time, we can't be reckless again, the lesson from hundreds of years ago was not to be taken lightly. At least we should wait until the beast disaster arrives, and then we can come out of hiding."</p><p></p><p>"Yes! Hunker down! Hunkering down is not shameful, but being captured and locked up by humans, that would be shameful."</p><p></p><p>"However, we also need to cultivate, we can't slack off. And I haven't eaten human flesh for a very long time, I've been suppressing the craving for hundreds of years, I'm almost starving to death."</p><p></p><p>"Don't worry, when I came to the mainland in the past, I had subdued a group of tiger-like beasts, after hundreds of years, they should be doing well, I can use them to capture some humans for us to enjoy."</p><p></p><p>"Good idea. I have also rallied a number of half-beasts, and established quite a few half-beast organizations. I'll go find them and have them help me capture humans.</p><p></p><p>In this way, we can hide in the shadows and manipulate, without having to face the humans directly, so we won't attract the attention of those human experts.</p><p></p><p>Noel Fei, do you want to join us?"</p><p></p><p>Noel Fei shook his head, his gaze icy and his expression grave:</p><p></p><p>"These damned humans, before, they actually cut off a part of my body, and used it to create a split body, which they used as the formation eye for a small city called Jianghai City.</p><p></p><p>I must go to Jianghai City in person, find my split body, and destroy Jianghai City.</p><p></p><p>Let them know the consequences of humiliating me."</p><p></p><p>"Good! In that case, let's split up. When the beast disaster comes, we'll regroup."</p><p></p><p>"Farewell then."</p><p></p><p>"Goodbye."</p><p></p><p>The star beasts one by one transformed into streams of light and departed.</p><p></p><p>A few days later, Ye Xiao came to the library for his normal shift, and the library's operations finally began.</p><p></p><p>Quite a few old colleagues had been dismissed due to insufficient cultivation.</p><p></p><p>Ye Xiao was fine, his own strength was already very strong, he had just been suppressing his cultivation all along. Now, as long as he slightly released the suppression and raised his cultivation a little, reaching the Xiantian Sixth Grade would be no problem.</p><p></p><p>After all, several old friends had given him some elixirs as support, he was not worried about being suspected.</p><p></p><p>After the morning meeting, Director Ouyang began to talk to the remaining supervisors one by one.</p><p></p><p>Ye Xiao was the fifth one.</p><p></p><p>He came to the director's office, and Ouyang Yunzhong immediately welcomed him with a smile.</p><p></p><p>"Little Ye, please have a seat."</p><p></p><p>Ye Xiao nodded and sat down. Ouyang Yunzhong smiled and said, "I really didn't expect that in the end, you would give me such a big surprise.</p><p></p><p>I thought you would be one of those who would be dismissed this time.</p><p></p><p>How did you do it? Suddenly raising your cultivation to the Xiantian Sixth Grade? It's really astonishing."</p><p></p><p>Ye Xiao's expression remained calm as he said, "It's all thanks to the help of some friends. Qin Yuyan gave me a Grandmaster-level elixir, Master Facheng gave me a Condensing Spirit Pill, Gu Hai lent me some money to buy elixirs, and Liu Chengxun also gave me some very good elixirs.</p><p></p><p>With the help of these things, I was able to condense my spirit and break through."</p><p></p><p>Ouyang Yunzhong nodded approvingly and said, "Not bad, I didn't expect you to have so many friends in the unseen world!</p><p></p><p>I was actually wondering how to help you get through this hurdle, but now it seems unnecessary."</p><p></p><p>After a pause, she spoke again:</p><p></p><p>"And you've also just encountered a great opportunity."</p><p></p><p>"Great opportunity?"</p><p></p><p>Ye Xiao was a little puzzled.</p><p></p><p>Ouyang Yunzhong smiled and said:</p><p></p><p>"It's like this, since the library is going to expand, there will inevitably be more recruitment in the future, and some leadership positions will be generated.</p><p></p><p>The Central Province has given us a few training quotas, asking me to select a few younger, more experienced library management staff with good cultivation to go to the Central Province Martial Arts University for further training.</p><p></p><p>I had already drafted a list of quotas, but I wasn't sure if you would still be able to work in the library, so I didn't include you.</p><p></p><p>Now that you've passed the assessment and your cultivation has reached the Xiantian Sixth Grade, you're just qualified to participate in the training.</p><p></p><p>Are you willing to go?"</p><p></p><p>After a pause, she added another sentence.</p><p></p><p>"The training quotas this time are very few and precious, and after the training, there will definitely be a promotion."</p>

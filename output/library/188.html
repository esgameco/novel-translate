        <h1>Chapter 188</h1>
        <div class="content">
            <p>Here is the full English translation of the Chinese excerpt:</p><p></p><p>The great dragon swayed its body, seemingly understanding and not understanding. Ye Xiao gave Huan Liuli a slight smile.</p><p></p><p>"Do you see? The great dragon has agreed. You should quickly go and eat something, try to improve your cultivation as soon as possible. </p><p></p><p>The great dragon is now considered a divine weapon, and there are only a few like it in the entire world. You should make yourself stronger, so that you can be worthy of it!"</p><p></p><p>Huan Liuli: "(((//Д//)))!"</p><p></p><p>What is this situation? Why does she feel something is not quite right? She originally just wanted to serve Ye Xiao a bit, then compete with the great dragon for his favor, to protect her position as the first major internal manager of the Ye family.</p><p></p><p>But in the blink of an eye, it's turned into her liking the great dragon? And Ye Xiao's expression, like a proud father watching his daughter grow up, what does that mean? "Are you too happy? So you don't even know to eat? If you don't eat, I'll finish it all?"</p><p></p><p>Ye Xiao spoke again, and Huan Liuli lightly coughed, quickly sitting down in her seat.</p><p></p><p>Whatever the case, as long as the great dragon and the master don't get too close, that's good enough. </p><p></p><p>This can be considered the first step of success.</p><p></p><p>Next, she'll think of a way to get closer to the master, to make the master pay more attention to her! She glanced at the great dragon beside her, inwardly snorting disdainfully, very displeased.</p><p></p><p>The master doesn't know how many good things he's given it, allowing it to advance to become a divine weapon in such a short time.</p><p></p><p>It makes her so sour.</p><p></p><p>But the next stage will belong to the Zha family!</p><p></p><p>The Zha family will become the first major manager of the Ye family.</p><p></p><p>As the manager, she needs to do it for 1,500 years. No, she needs to add more time, after all, being with Ye Xiao has so many benefits.</p><p></p><p>Add another 500 years! 2,000 years! First serve the master as a slave for 2,000 years! Time will pass bit by bit, and soon it will be deep into the night.</p><p></p><p>"Pop~!"</p><p></p><p>In a secret underground chamber of the Wu Dao Academy in Jiang Hai City, Qin Yuyan slowly opened her eyes, the corners of her mouth slightly lifting.</p><p></p><p>She had broken through again.</p><p></p><p>Ever since awakening the Emperor's bloodline, it was as if she had unblocked her meridians, her cultivation speed shockingly fast.</p><p></p><p>Even many techniques that were previously difficult to understand, she could now easily learn and comprehend.</p><p></p><p>In such a short time, she had already broken through to the Xiantian Third Grade, the next step being Great Grandmaster.</p><p></p><p>This speed was not ordinary.</p><p></p><p>One must know that when she entered the Xiantian realm, she was later than Pu Jiansheng, but now, Pu Jiansheng was still at the Xiantian First Grade, while she had already reached the Xiantian Third Grade, surpassing him by a large margin.</p><p></p><p>Of course, the Emperor's bloodline was a factor, but more importantly, the Nine Heavens had given her tremendous support.</p><p></p><p>Saint-Emperor grade elixirs, she could now eat them like candy, basically getting one every day.</p><p></p><p>Previously, she had even consumed a legendary Emperor-Grade elixir.</p><p></p><p>It was said to be an extremely rare existence in the Nine Heavens.</p><p></p><p>Even at the Great Grandmaster realm, one might not be qualified to obtain it.</p><p></p><p>It was refined by a Xiantian Sixth Grade Great Grandmaster-level spirit beast, taking a full month to refine.</p><p></p><p>It was said that the refiner was one of the top-tier elixir refiners in the Nine Heavens!</p><p></p><p>In addition, the Nine Heavens had also assigned her two Divine Patriarchs - one to protect her safety, and one to guide her cultivation.</p><p></p><p>Of course, these two Divine Patriarchs were not the kind ranked highly on the Dragon Ranking or Phoenix Ranking.</p><p></p><p>The Divine Patriarchs ranked on the Dragon and Phoenix Rankings in the Nine Heavens were only seventeen in total, and they were all responsible for guarding various regions to prevent spirit beast disturbances.</p><p></p><p>At most, adding the newly entered Dao Sword Immortal senior, there were only eighteen.</p><p></p><p>But even so, the two Divine Patriarchs sent by the Nine Heavens were renowned existences on the Tiger Ranking.</p><p></p><p>The Seventh Ranked on the Tiger Ranking, Lian Chimu!</p><p></p><p>The Nineteenth Ranked on the Tiger Ranking, Yue Xinlian!</p><p></p><p>They were both prominent figures in the martial dao world, and they specialized in the Dao of the Blade.</p><p></p><p>It's not that the Nine Heavens didn't value her, on the contrary, they valued her greatly! But there was one thing, the Nine Heavens still didn't know who the Dao Sword Immortal was, and that she had learned the Dao of the Blade from the Dao Sword Immortal senior. So the Nine Heavens Alliance couldn't be sure if the Dao Sword Immortal would be willing to let them take her away.</p><p></p><p>To avoid unnecessary conflict, they had no choice but to use this method.</p><p></p><p>First let Lian Chimu and Yue Xinlian protect and guide her martial cultivation.</p><p></p><p>Anyway, her current cultivation level was not enough, with their guidance, it would be sufficient.</p><p></p><p>When they could no longer teach her, if the Dao Sword Immortal still hadn't appeared, the Nine Heavens would send people to escort her to find Dao Patriarch Li Liushui and Fire Crow Zhu Que!</p><p></p><p>Let those two great masters further instruct her.</p><p></p><p>Otherwise, she might have already gone to seek such great masters for learning.</p><p></p><p>Of course, Qin Yuyan didn't feel this was unfair to her.</p><p></p><p>If she hadn't learned that Dao of the Blade from the Dao Sword Immortal senior, she wouldn't even be able to reach the Xiantian First Grade now, let alone awaken the Emperor's bloodline.</p><p></p><p>It was because of the Dao Sword Immortal senior that she could achieve today's accomplishments and good fortune.</p><p></p><p>So, for the rest of her life, the one she respects the most...</p><p></p><p>Here is the full English translation of the Chinese excerpt:</p><p></p><p>"It's all thanks to the guidance of Senior Sword Immortal!" </p><p></p><p>The door to the underground secret chamber was quietly opened.</p><p></p><p>One of the two Divine Patriarchs, Yue Xinling, stepped in slowly.</p><p></p><p>She wore a tight-fitting light blue dress, her tall and slender figure without a trace of excess flesh, her curves perfect. </p><p></p><p>Such a physique, an absolute goddess, was rarely one that a man could resist.</p><p></p><p>Although she was already over a hundred years old, she still looked much younger than the ninety-something Ouyang Yunzhong, the director of the Jianghai Library.</p><p></p><p>This was because she was a Divine Patriarch, while Ouyang Yunzhong was only at the Innate First Grade realm.</p><p></p><p>The gap in their cultivation was too vast, and her eternal youth demanded extremely high cultivation requirements.</p><p></p><p>Qin Yueyan immediately stood up, cupping her hands and bowing to Yue Xinling:</p><p></p><p>"It's all thanks to the Master's teachings, thank you Master."</p><p></p><p>Yue Xinling waved her hand and smiled:</p><p></p><p>"You don't need to be so polite, it's mainly because of your bloodline. We only played a guiding role.</p><p></p><p>Moreover, cultivating you well is also beneficial for the entire human race.</p><p></p><p>But truly, you are the Imperial bloodline! If it were an ordinary person, even if they were a genius and had a Divine Patriarch teaching them, cultivated the Imperial Art, and had many medicinal pills supporting them, they still wouldn't be able to break through two realms and reach the Innate Third Grade realm in such a short time."</p><p></p><p>Qin Yueyan did not show any pride, but instead asked, "Senior Yue, I want to know, what are the current cultivation realms of the other Holy Scions and Holy Maidens?"</p><p></p><p>"Hmm, this is originally a secret, but since you are also of the Imperial bloodline, I can tell you.</p><p></p><p>Currently, aside from you, there are three other Imperial bloodline descendants.</p><p></p><p>One is the daughter of the Jing Du Ye Clan, Ye Wushuang, 23 years old, who has already reached the Innate Sixth Grade and is expected to break through to the Innate Seventh Grade Divine Patriarch realm at any moment.</p><p></p><p>Another is Zhu Tianyu of the Jin Ling Zhu Clan, 26 years old, who has already reached the Innate Seventh Grade Divine Patriarch realm! The last one is Feng Qingyang of the Ice Origin Feng Clan in the Extreme North of the Nine Provinces, 30 years old, an Innate Eighth Grade Divine Patriarch!"</p><p></p><p>"Whew! How terrifying!" Qin Yueyan couldn't help but take a sharp breath.</p><p></p><p>"How can their cultivation have risen so quickly? I heard that the Sword Saint Lü Qingshan, ranked 10th on the World Dragon Rankings, only reached the Innate Seventh Grade Divine Patriarch realm at 30 years old! How can they all be stronger than Lü Qingshan?"</p><p></p><p>Yue Xinling smiled wryly.</p><p></p><p>"You can't compare like that. Think about it, Lü Qingshan is only ranked 10th on the World Dragon Rankings. There are even more powerful geniuses above him.</p><p></p><p>He reached the Innate Seventh Grade at 30, but those who reached the Innate Supreme Grade in their 20s are numerous.</p><p></p><p>You have to know that those who have entered the Star Battlefield are not even included in the major rankings.</p><p></p><p>And the Imperial bloodline descendants, there are only a few of them in the entire world, probably not even more than ten.</p><p></p><p>In the Nine Provinces, there are only the four of you."</p><p></p><p>Qin Yueyan nodded.</p><p></p><p>"That's true, after all, we have cultivated for over 20 years to reach this realm, it's not like we reached Divine Patriarch in just one year. This can be considered a normal range."</p><p></p><p>"Yes, if someone could cultivate to Divine Patriarch in just one year, he would not be human.</p><p></p><p>Reaching Divine Patriarch in over 20 years, among the geniuses of the world, this is not considered too abnormal."</p><p></p><p>"It's just a pity that I'm the weakest one, only at the Innate Third Grade even now, not even an Grand Master. Compared to the others, I'm truly ashamed."</p><p></p><p>Yue Xinling smiled.</p><p></p><p>"You don't need to be too self-deprecating. The fact that you awakened later is the reason why your cultivation is a bit slower, which is also very normal.</p><p></p><p>The pity is that the alchemy techniques in the Nine Provinces have not yet reached the level where they can easily refine pills using Divine Patriarch spirit beasts.</p><p></p><p>To refine pills with Divine Patriarch spirit beasts, the alchemy master's cultivation must reach the peak of Grand Master, and their spiritual power must reach the Innate Seventh Grade! Otherwise, they will easily suffer backlash from the spirit beast's spiritual power during the refinement process.</p><p></p><p>If you could refine pills using Divine Patriarch spirit beasts, your cultivation speed would definitely rise to an even higher level."</p><p></p><p>Qin Yueyan shook her head with a smile.</p><p></p><p>Refine pills using Divine Patriarch spirit beasts? </p><p></p><p>How could that be possible?</p><p></p><p>That's simply a fantasy.</p><p></p><p>Humans slaying Divine Patriarch spirit beasts might still have a chance, but refining pills is not as simple as just killing them. It's at least ten times more difficult.</p><p></p><p>Moreover, it has extremely strict requirements for the alchemist.</p><p></p><p>The highest level alchemists in the world are in the Nine Provinces, but even the top-tier alchemists there might not be up to the task.</p><p></p><p>Probably there is no one in the entire world who can refine pills using Divine Patriarch spirit beasts.</p>

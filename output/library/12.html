        <h1>Chapter 12</h1>
        <div class="content">
            <p>Here is the full English translation of the Chinese excerpt:</p><p></p><p>"Keep pretending! Keep pretending!"</p><p></p><p>Gu Hai looked at him with disdain.</p><p></p><p>"I've always wondered why you never go to the Red Romance club, turns out you've got a beautiful, long-legged girlfriend!"</p><p></p><p>Ye Xiao: "???"</p><p></p><p>His brows knitted together.</p><p></p><p>"You're out of your mind, I don't have a girlfriend."</p><p></p><p>"Ha! You're still denying it, look at that girl who's always sitting in your area."</p><p></p><p>Gu Hai angrily pointed to Qin Yuyan in the distance.</p><p></p><p>Ye Xiao saw her and was slightly surprised.</p><p></p><p>So it was her. </p><p></p><p>Her student ID had been left here yesterday, but if he said he knew her, Gu Hai would misunderstand.</p><p></p><p>So he shook his head slightly.</p><p></p><p>"I don't know her."</p><p></p><p>In fact, he really didn't know Qin Yuyan, he had only exchanged a few words with her.</p><p></p><p>"You really don't know her?"</p><p></p><p>"You're more of a man than I am."</p><p></p><p>"Alright, I'll go ask for her WeChat."</p><p></p><p>Gu Hai quickly ran over and asked in a sly manner, "Hello, I..."</p><p></p><p>"Scram!"</p><p></p><p>Before Gu Hai could finish, she coldly spat out the word "Scram", instantly wiping the smile off his face.</p><p></p><p>He rubbed his nose and awkwardly left, Ye Xiao walking over to him.</p><p></p><p>"Let that teach you to be smug, come on, let's go eat."</p><p></p><p>Gu Hai gave him a resentful look.</p><p></p><p>"Eat, eat, eat, that's all you know. I really don't understand how the heavens gave such a good-looking face to you. They gave it to you, but you don't even like to chase girls. Not to be rude, Ye, but you're wasting your looks, and you'll pay for it someday."</p><p></p><p>Ye Xiao just smiled and didn't argue. </p><p></p><p>Gu Hai was right, when it came to appearance, Ye Xiao had always had it under control.</p><p></p><p>In fact, as his abilities gradually increased, his inherent charisma was also constantly growing.</p><p></p><p>But he didn't like the feeling of being tightly bound. Right now, he wanted to savor the freedom of being single.</p><p></p><p>Of course, from another perspective, it could also be said that he was confident enough in his looks that he could find a girlfriend anytime, so he wasn't in a hurry.</p><p></p><p>After lunch, Gu Hai went back to the dorm to rest, while Ye Xiao, as usual, came to read books.</p><p></p><p>Soon, Qin Yuyan walked over, with a hint of uncertainty, and asked cautiously, "Uh, I wanted to ask if you saw my student ID yesterday?"</p><p></p><p>Ye Xiao, without looking up from his book, responded, "Top right of the first shelf on the left."</p><p></p><p>Qin Yuyan paused, then went over and sure enough found her student ID.</p><p></p><p>She quickly walked back.</p><p></p><p>"Thank you, I thought I had lost it on the way."</p><p></p><p>"Mm."</p><p></p><p>Ye Xiao responded with a single indifferent word, his cold attitude making Qin Yuyan feel slightly awkward.</p><p></p><p>She had never encountered a guy who was so indifferent to her before.</p><p></p><p>But looking closely, this little administrator was so good-looking, he probably didn't lack female attention, so his indifference towards her was quite normal.</p><p></p><p>"Uh, can I ask you another question?"</p><p></p><p>Ye Xiao raised his brow slightly and put down the book in his hand.</p><p></p><p>"Go ahead."</p><p></p><p>"I want to learn swordsmanship, but the swordsmanship here is too diverse, so I was wondering, since you're the administrator, you must know these books pretty well..."</p><p></p><p>Here is the full English translation of the Chinese excerpt:</p><p></p><p>"Excuse me, can you recommend some good books on sword techniques or which sword techniques are more commonly chosen by people?" </p><p></p><p>Ye Xiao glanced at her right hand. The base of her thumb, the middle of her index finger, and the lower left corner of her palm had some calluses, though they were still relatively soft. Since she didn't know sword techniques, she must be practicing with a sword.</p><p></p><p>Her cultivation level was also no secret to Ye Xiao - she had already reached the fifth level of the Innate realm.</p><p></p><p>At her age, reaching the fifth level of the Innate realm meant she had exceptional talent.</p><p></p><p>If she were to switch to learning blade techniques now, it would likely waste a lot of her time and undo the progress she had made in sword techniques over the years.</p><p></p><p>But what did that have to do with him? </p><p></p><p>What she chose to learn was her own freedom. He just needed to do his job as a manager.</p><p></p><p>After a brief silence, he continued, "What's popular with others may not necessarily suit you. After all, most who practice blade techniques are men.</p><p></p><p>And the blade techniques men practice are usually grand and expansive.</p><p></p><p>The Falling Snow Blade from the 5th book on the 7th shelf of the 3rd row is continuous and graceful, with relatively low spiritual energy consumption, suitable for young ladies.</p><p></p><p>The Luo Family Blade from the 11th book on the 2nd shelf of the 4th row has a solid foundation, good for beginners.</p><p></p><p>The Hunting Fox Blade from the 6th book on the 1st shelf of the 5th row has a devious technique with many changes, effective for defeating enemies.</p><p></p><p>For a newcomer, you can start by taking a look at these three blade techniques."</p><p></p><p>Qin Yuyan couldn't help but exclaim in surprise, "Wow, you seem to have done extensive research on blade techniques. Your abilities must be extraordinary!"</p><p></p><p>After all, she had just asked Ye Xiao for a recommendation, but he had selected three very suitable techniques, even explaining the advantages of each one. "You're overthinking it. If my abilities were that extraordinary, I wouldn't be working as a manager here. I only know the techniques in my own area, the ones in other areas I'm not familiar with at all."</p><p></p><p>Qin Yuyan nodded. Ye Xiao was right - cultivators of high attainment were usually snatched up by the military or major companies, they wouldn't be working as a humble manager. And as a manager, he would naturally be knowledgeable about the techniques in his own area.</p><p></p><p>"Thank you."</p><p></p><p>"You're welcome." </p><p></p><p>He uttered the two words indifferently and continued reading his book. Qin Yuyan knew Ye Xiao didn't want to talk to her anymore, so she turned and went to the first floor hall to borrow the books.</p><p></p><p>There were two ways to borrow books from the library - through the area manager or at the first floor hall. Qin Yuyan knew Ye Xiao probably didn't like being disturbed, so she didn't ask him to handle the borrowing process.</p><p></p><p>As for Ye Xiao, he had overestimated his own moral character and underestimated the abilities of the plagiarists.</p><p></p><p>In the morning, he had reviewed nearly 200 cultivation techniques, from which he had selected three Origin Heart Techniques. From noon until closing time, he had gone through almost a thousand books, but had only obtained one independent Origin Heart Technique - the rest were all plagiarized, originating from his other five Origin Heart Techniques.</p><p></p><p>But it wasn't entirely due to his poor character, because in the screening process, Ye Xiao had also found one Origin Sword Technique.</p><p></p><p>With this, his Origin Sword Technique had reached eight volumes. The eight pages in the golden book recording the Origin Sword Technique were starting to faintly glow with a golden light.</p><p></p><p>This meant he was close to being able to fuse an extremely powerful sword technique.</p><p></p><p>He just needed one or two more basic sword techniques.</p>

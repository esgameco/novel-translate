        <h1>Chapter 420</h1>
        <div class="content">
            <p>Here is the full English translation of the Chinese excerpt:</p><p></p><p>The starry sky does not belong solely to the Xuanyuan Clan!</p><p></p><p>There are countless divine clans in the starry sky, more than can be counted.</p><p></p><p>Furthermore, while the Xuanyuan Clan ranks very high, they are not the number one existence, and do not possess the power to completely crush the other divine clans.</p><p></p><p>Behind the Alliance of a Hundred Clans, there are also some divine clans that are subordinate to other more powerful divine clans.</p><p></p><p>Among those more powerful divine clans, some are not weaker than the Xuanyuan Clan.</p><p></p><p>There is a certain degree of constraint between the major divine clans.</p><p></p><p>Except for the top-tier Dragon Clan, Phoenix Clan, and others, the other divine clans do not possess the power to easily annihilate clans other than themselves.</p><p></p><p>If the Xuanyuan Clan were to act without restraint and directly dispatch their more powerful divine kings to massacre the Alliance of a Hundred Clans, it would provide a reason for the higher-level divine clans behind the alliance to retaliate against the Xuanyuan Clan.</p><p></p><p>At that point, the Xuanyuan Clan would truly be playing with fire.</p><p></p><p>And below the divine kings, the Alliance of a Hundred Clans has too many methods at their disposal.</p><p></p><p>The advantage of the higher-level divine clans lies in the sheer number of their top experts.</p><p></p><p>While the Alliance of a Hundred Clans may not have enough high-level experts to contend with them, they have a sufficient number of divine-realm and divine-slaying-realm cultivators.</p><p></p><p>Below the divine kings, their numbers far exceed those of their opponents.</p><p></p><p>At this moment, the Alliance of a Hundred Clans is discussing their next course of action.</p><p></p><p>"In recent days, as we have continuously reinforced our forces, we have already exerted a certain degree of suppression on the Xuanyuan Clan currently in the Canglang Star Domain.</p><p></p><p>If my guess is correct, they should have already contacted their clan's powerful experts, and it won't be long before divine king-realm or late divine-slaying-realm experts arrive.</p><p></p><p>But for now, the highest-level experts of the Xuanyuan Clan here are only at the seventh layer of the divine-slaying realm.</p><p></p><p>We can take advantage of this period to continue our reckless actions.</p><p></p><p>Once their powerful experts truly arrive, we'll have to tuck our tails and behave."</p><p></p><p>"Well said. But just tucking our tails and behaving may not be enough to protect us.</p><p></p><p>The Xuanyuan Clan won't recklessly send out their divine kings to massacre us, as that would not be accepted by the higher-level divine clans behind us.</p><p></p><p>However, if we encounter the plundering of divine king tombs, or even the possible appearance of divine emperor tombs in the future, they will have sufficient reason to intervene and monopolize such high-level divine resources.</p><p></p><p>That would be the truly troublesome situation for us.</p><p></p><p>After all, while we can mobilize quite a few divine kings, in the face of truly powerful higher-level experts, our divine kings are still inferior."</p><p></p><p>"In that case, perhaps we should choose to give up some interests in exchange for the support of the higher-level divine clans behind us.</p><p></p><p>Otherwise, when we encounter those exceptional resources, we'll just have to stand and watch helplessly."</p><p></p><p>"Our Yishen Clan agrees. But before requesting the support of the higher-level divine clans behind us, we should seize the opportunity to make another move, taking advantage of the fact that our current strength exceeds the Xuanyuan Clan's investment here, and grab some benefits first.</p><p></p><p>Once we can no longer take advantage, that would be a loss."</p><p></p><p>"Correct. The Xuanyuan Clan's powerful experts won't be able to arrive here so quickly.</p><p></p><p>As long as we don't go too overboard, don't harm those Xuanyuan Clan junior disciples, and don't completely exterminate the Xuanyuan Clan members here, their top experts, the divine emperors, won't be able to directly retaliate against us.</p><p></p><p>If the divine emperors don't come out, there won't be any problem.</p><p></p><p>Later, when the higher-level divine clans behind us join the battle, the Xuanyuan Clan will be thoroughly intimidated, and their divine emperors won't dare to act rashly."</p><p></p><p>"The Thunder God Clan also agrees."</p><p></p><p>"The Gigantic Ape Clan also agrees."</p><p></p><p>Under the leadership of one divine clan after another, these plans were quickly confirmed.</p><p></p><p>Although there were some dissenting voices, they were in the minority and unable to change the voting of the other divine clans.</p><p></p><p>And so, in the following days, the Alliance of a Hundred Clans intensified their attacks on the Xuanyuan Clan, going beyond just crossing the line, and directly delving into the divine tombs occupied by the Xuanyuan Clan, engaging in plundering and excavation. They not only killed and injured many Xuanyuan Clan disciples, but also looted a large amount of resources.</p><p></p><p>Faced with this situation, the powerful experts of the Xuanyuan Clan, although they had not yet had time to arrive, did not show any signs of weakness, and immediately organized a fierce counterattack.</p><p></p><p>Over time, the Alliance of a Hundred Clans also suffered heavy losses, with even some divine-slaying-realm experts perishing.</p><p></p><p>Soon, the Alliance of a Hundred Clans began to struggle to bear the burden, as their divine kings were clan treasures that could not be casually dispatched.</p><p></p><p>Their divine-slaying-realm experts were precious combat resources, and the loss of too many would be unbearable.</p><p></p><p>Moreover, if time continued to pass in this way, in less than a month, the high-level experts sent by the Xuanyuan Clan would arrive, and their pressure would be even greater.</p><p></p><p>The Xuanyuan Clan's divine-slaying-realm experts at the eighth, ninth, and half-step divine emperor realms...</p><p></p><p>Here is the full English translation of the Chinese excerpt:</p><p></p><p>The Shenking definitely has more than them, and his cultivation method is also better.</p><p></p><p>Even if no one becomes a Shenking, the Xuanyuan Clan will still have more advantages.</p><p></p><p>If they are forced into a corner and want to jump the wall, sending out a Shenking, then the Xuanyuan Clan will have a good excuse to send out an expert of the same strength.</p><p></p><p>The Shenking of the Xuanyuan Clan, don't even think about it, 100% stronger than their clan's Shenking.</p><p></p><p>Everyone's cultivation methods are different, not completely on the same level, but the other side definitely has a huge advantage.</p><p></p><p>So, in the less than a month to come, the Hundred Tribes Alliance must find a way to hold back all this! Of course, holding it back is not that easy? Until this day, the Hundred Tribes Alliance has come another person, the Hundred Tribes Alliance, it seems to have finally found a solution.</p><p></p><p>In the human world, the core members of the major families of the Xuanyuan Clan gathered in Jianghai City.</p><p></p><p>Everyone's face had an air of pride and delight.</p><p></p><p>"We've finally vented our anger a bit recently. The Hundred Tribes Alliance wanted to join forces to deal with us, but ended up being beaten to the point of being scared shitless."</p><p></p><p>"That's right. You don't know, our Ling family yesterday slaughtered a Feixian Realm Fifth Stage expert from the Hundred Tribes Alliance, directly scaring the guy to the point of pissing his pants. It made me feel so refreshed and exhilarated!"</p><p></p><p>"We have also slain not a few experts from the Hundred Tribes Alliance. Even if we didn't go see it, we can still see the results."</p><p></p><p>Ning Zhiyuan tapped the table, signaling the crowd to be quiet.</p><p></p><p>Although his strength is not the strongest among the current young masters, far inferior to experts like Zheng Fenghua at the Shen Realm Sixth Stage, he came the earliest and is in charge of Jianghai City, so here he is the host, sitting at the head.</p><p></p><p>"Everyone, now is not the time for us to be happy. You must know that the Hundred Tribes Alliance still has many of our territories, where there are many Shen Tombs, and there may even be Shenking Realm tombs! Before we have fully reclaimed our territories, we cannot be careless."</p><p></p><p>Everyone nodded.</p><p></p><p>"The cultivation methods of our Xuanyuan Clan's core members are generally stronger than those of the Hundred Tribes Alliance. That's why we were able to suppress them and stabilize the situation again.</p><p></p><p>Next, we must seize the opportunity and accelerate the attack, driving the Hundred Tribes Alliance out of our Xuanyuan Clan's star domain."</p><p></p><p>However, at this moment, suddenly, a disciple of the Ning family rushed into the hall from outside.</p><p></p><p>"Young Master, the people from the Hundred Tribes Alliance have come."</p><p></p><p>"What did you say?"</p><p></p><p>At this moment, not only Ning Zhiyuan, but even the others present, couldn't help but feel a bit surprised.</p><p></p><p>No one had expected the people from the Hundred Tribes Alliance to come at this time.</p><p></p><p>After all, the two sides are still fighting a life-and-death battle.</p><p></p><p>Ning Zhiyuan glanced at the crowd and then spoke:</p><p></p><p>"How many people did they bring?"</p><p></p><p>"Reporting to the Young Master, they only brought two people, saying they are here to deliver a message."</p><p></p><p>Ning Zhiyuan pondered for a moment, then spoke:</p><p></p><p>"Let them come in."</p><p></p><p>"Zhiyuan, they are coming at this time, surely they have no good intentions."</p><p></p><p>"I know, but since they are here to deliver a message, if we don't receive them, we may be laughed at by others. Let's see what they have to say first."</p><p></p><p>The crowd nodded, and soon two figures walked in.</p><p></p><p>Seeing the members of the Xuanyuan Clan, the two people's eyes had a slight hint of timidity, but in order to maintain their and their clan's dignity, they still stood upright.</p><p></p><p>"Envoys of the Hundred Tribes Alliance, greet the young masters of the Xuanyuan Clan, greet the elders of the Xuanyuan Clan."</p><p></p><p>Ning Zhiyuan spoke indifferently:</p><p></p><p>"What do you want to do by coming here at this time?"</p><p></p><p>"Responding to the Young Master, our Hundred Tribes Alliance feels that the recent conflict is not worthwhile, so we have specially sent us two to deliver a message, to simply call it off, and to focus on excavating the Shen Tombs instead of continuing the conflict between us."</p><p></p><p>Before Ning Zhiyuan could speak, Ling Shaoyu had already blurted out mockingly:</p><p></p><p>"Your words sound nice, just flapping your lips and saying you want to make peace? What are you guys? Don't forget, this was started by you. Not only did you kill many of our people, but you also seized many of our star islands, invading our Xuanyuan Clan's star domains!</p><p></p><p>If you want to make peace, first return all the star domains you have invaded, and then compensate us with a hundred million Shen Tomb resources, then we can talk."</p><p></p><p>"Hehe hehe"</p><p></p><p>The two envoys smiled slightly, then spoke:</p><p></p><p>"Ling Young Master, this is a bit unreasonable. Who defined the boundaries of the star domains around here? The entire Canglang Star Realm does not belong solely to the Xuanyuan Clan, everyone has a share, isn't that right?"</p>

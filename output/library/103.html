        <h1>Chapter 103</h1>
        <div class="content">
            <p>Here is the full English translation of the Chinese excerpt:</p><p></p><p>"This is Ye Xiao, a long-time customer of our store, and a young achiever. Ye Xiao, this is my daughter, Xu Daomao."</p><p></p><p>"Hello!"</p><p></p><p>Xu Daomao wiped her hands on her pants and extended her right hand.</p><p></p><p>The broad back silhouette made Ye Xiao think of the rugged American men in movies - dark skin, thick body hair, large palms, and thick lips. No wonder they call her Xu Daomao, she really is a big cat! A super big one!</p><p></p><p>Ye Xiao looked up at the other person and simply gave a brief handshake.</p><p></p><p>"Hello."</p><p></p><p>"My dad is probably trying to introduce me to a suitor again, huh? Don't worry, my dad is a dumbass, but I'm not. I'm quite self-aware. After all, a handsome guy like you could never possibly be interested in me."</p><p></p><p>Xu Daomao's mentality was quite good, which surprised Ye Xiao a bit.</p><p></p><p>Xu's father glared sternly at Xu Daomao.</p><p></p><p>"You little brat, what nonsense are you spouting?"</p><p></p><p>Xu Daomao rolled her eyes at him impatiently.</p><p></p><p>"Dad! Can you just calm down? With someone like me, if you try to introduce me to someone, aren't you just harming that person for life?"</p><p></p><p>"You little brat, can't even find a partner. When I'm old, let's see who's going to take care of you then."</p><p></p><p>"Then I'll just live in a nursing home."</p><p></p><p>Ye Xiao watched the father-daughter banter and shook his head with a wry smile.</p><p></p><p>"Miss, you needn't underestimate yourself so much. A beautiful heart is the true beauty."</p><p></p><p>Xu Daomao, with her straightforward manner, waved her hand.</p><p></p><p>"Save the polite talk, my ears are practically calloused from hearing it. If there's nothing else, I'll go back to moving my pig iron. Still got several tons left to move."</p><p></p><p>Ye Xiao nodded, and Xu Daomao left in quick strides, while Xu's father lamented somewhat regretfully:</p><p></p><p>"This dead girl, she really has no brains at all."</p><p></p><p>Ye Xiao leisurely spoke up:</p><p></p><p>"I think she's fine, at least better than you. Honest."</p><p></p><p>Xu's father gave an embarrassed laugh, but being thick-skinned, he didn't say much more.</p><p></p><p>Ye Xiao spoke up again.</p><p></p><p>"Mr. Xu, regarding my matters, I hope you won't spread them around. When you sell your flying daggers, I hope you won't mention me to others, otherwise I won't do business with you again in the future."</p><p></p><p>"Don't worry, I understand the importance of business confidentiality."</p><p></p><p>Ye Xiao nodded.</p><p></p><p>"In that case, I'll be leaving now."</p><p></p><p>"Okay."</p><p></p><p>The two parted ways, and Ye Xiao walked to a corner with no one around. After confirming the direction of Lingnan, he activated his divine technique and disappeared from the spot.</p><p></p><p>At the same time, deep in the mountains of Lingnan, a team was slowly approaching a pond.</p><p></p><p>Scattered in the jungle were many white bones, mostly of animals and celestial beasts, with a few rare human remains.</p><p></p><p>The young leader spoke softly:</p><p></p><p>"Everyone, be careful. The black-scaled snake in the pond ahead is a transcendent-level celestial beast, with strength at least equivalent to a late-stage Ninth-Grade cultivator.</p><p></p><p>This time, our company has hired a powerful force, and it was not easy to get this information.</p><p></p><p>The black-scaled snake is invaluable - its skin and scales can be refined into armor, its meat can replenish the blood qi of cultivators, its gallbladder can be used to refine vision-enhancing elixirs, and its bones and fangs can be used to make weapons. Its venom can also be refined into poison pills.</p><p></p><p>If we can capture it, it will be worth no less than three million!"</p><p></p><p>The group couldn't help but have their eyes light up with excitement, their enthusiasm evident.</p><p></p><p>The group approached the pond, and from afar, they could see a snake about five meters long.</p><p></p><p>Here is the full English translation of the Chinese excerpt:</p><p></p><p>There was a black-scaled snake as thick as an adult woman's forearm, coiled up and basking in the sun by the shore.</p><p></p><p>If they could ambush it successfully, they might be able to slay the black-scaled snake with minimal cost.</p><p></p><p>Everyone held their breath, not daring to take a deep breath, and slowly advanced.</p><p></p><p>But just then, one of the team members accidentally stepped on a brittle rib, making a crisp 'crack' sound.</p><p></p><p>"Damn it!"</p><p></p><p>Everyone's hearts trembled, and in the next second, the black-scaled snake that was sunbathing suddenly raised its black head, warily looking towards the forest.</p><p></p><p>Its pair of emerald green triangular eyes were darting around, as if pondering something.</p><p></p><p>"Attack! Don't let it escape," the team leader shouted. The group immediately rushed in from multiple directions to surround it.</p><p></p><p>The warriors near the pond's edge threw a few high-voltage pulse grenades, cutting off the black-scaled snake's retreat path to the pond and driving it towards the forest.</p><p></p><p>Other warriors launched various attacks in an orderly manner, and in the blink of an eye, a few sparks were scraped off the black-scaled snake's body.</p><p></p><p>A few warriors with higher-grade weapons even made the black-scaled snake experience the reason why the flowers were so red.</p><p></p><p>The black-scaled snake, in pain, let out a shrill 'hissing' cry. Its long tail lashed out like lightning towards two people, the spiritual energy wrapped around the tail acting like a long blade, directly slicing open their armor and leaving two crimson bloodstains on their chests.</p><p></p><p>The two were sent flying, spraying blood in the air, but before they even hit the ground, the others seized the opportunity to rush in and restrain the black-scaled snake's body with their weapons.</p><p></p><p>The leader then directly beheaded the black-scaled snake with a sword.</p><p></p><p>The thrilling battle had come to an end.</p><p></p><p>Seeing the continuously twitching black-scaled snake's severed head and its body, the group began to reveal joyful smiles.</p><p></p><p>They did it.</p><p></p><p>The team leader wasted no time, immediately saying, "Healers, heal the injured teammates. The rest of you, quickly bundle up the snake's body. The fresh blood will attract other star beasts, we need to leave quickly."</p><p></p><p>"Yes!"</p><p></p><p>The group efficiently divided the tasks, the entire team filled with joy.</p><p></p><p>However, just then, the team leader suddenly heard a 'hissing' sound. This sound was deeper and more profound than the previous black-scaled snake, as if a large amount of air around them was being drawn into a massive space.</p><p></p><p>In that instant, the leader's entire body couldn't help but feel cold, as if he had fallen into an icy pit.</p><p></p><p>When they first arrived, he had seen many skeletons, originally thinking they were just what the black-scaled snake had eaten.</p><p></p><p>But now, he felt something was not quite right.</p><p></p><p>Because this black-scaled snake was really too small. It couldn't possibly have eaten animals as large as cattle.</p><p></p><p>After all, snakes swallow their food whole and digest it in their stomachs before spitting out the bones.</p><p></p><p>And it couldn't have eaten that many either!</p><p></p><p>The black-scaled snake capable of consuming so much food and such large animals, how big would it have to be?</p><p></p><p>Thinking about this, the leader immediately shouted, "Quick! Retreat! Forget the black-scaled snake, just get out of here!"</p><p></p><p>But it was too late.</p><p></p><p>As soon as he spoke, a massive black shadow suddenly burst out from the forest, spitting out a mouthful of poison that instantly dissolved two warriors, leaving not even a bone fragment behind.</p><p></p><p>The night deepens.</p><p></p><p>(Chapter end)</p>

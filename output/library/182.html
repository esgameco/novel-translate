        <h1>Chapter 182</h1>
        <div class="content">
            <p>Here is the full English translation of the Chinese excerpt:</p><p></p><p>Iron Blood Essence.</p><p></p><p>It can give weapons the same iron molecular blood structure as humans, allowing weapons and the human body to be compatible.</p><p></p><p>To put it simply, it's similar to the immortal cultivation novels, where weapons can be stored inside the body.</p><p></p><p>This is an extremely high-level material, and the price is equally steep.</p><p></p><p>Although Ye Xiao now has a storage ring and can store the Tango Saber at any time, it's still different from this.</p><p></p><p>Not only is the prestige high, but it's also very convenient.</p><p></p><p>In some places with restrictions, the space ring may not be able to be activated, but if the weapon is inside the body, it can be taken out at any time.</p><p></p><p>Furthermore, as the weapon gains consciousness, it also makes it easier to improve the relationship between the master and the weapon.</p><p></p><p>It's just not known if the weapon will automatically come out.</p><p></p><p>If it suddenly comes out during some unspeakable act, giving the person a chill, that would be too terrifying.</p><p></p><p>In addition, there are many other things.</p><p></p><p>All of them are of great value.</p><p></p><p>Collecting these things is not something that can be done in a single day.</p><p></p><p>The existence of the Beast God Alliance must have been passed down for more than a hundred years.</p><p></p><p>The items collected by the successive leaders of the Beast God Alliance are all here.</p><p></p><p>This is a huge harvest! If these items are used to enhance his own armor and the Emperor's Saber Tango, he doesn't know how powerful they can become.</p><p></p><p>Just as Ye Xiao was inspecting, he suddenly noticed two iron boxes, which made him pause.</p><p></p><p>"What is this?"</p><p></p><p>He scanned them with the Taixuan Tiangong, and his eyes couldn't help but flicker.</p><p></p><p>These two boxes were forged from special materials that could shield spiritual power!</p><p></p><p>Wow, even spiritual power can be shielded, it seems there must be good things inside.</p><p></p><p>Ye Xiao increased the frequency of the Taixuan Tiangong and began to inspect again.</p><p></p><p>The next moment, he found himself in a vast and pitch-black place.</p><p></p><p>"Roar—!"</p><p></p><p>A thunderous roar that shook the heart, and Ye Xiao was immediately stunned.</p><p></p><p>In his line of sight, a giant dragon soul over hundreds of meters long was circling in the darkness.</p><p></p><p>It emanated a thick aura of killing intent and evil, and anger filled the entire space.</p><p></p><p>There was actually a dragon soul here! No, this was not a dragon soul.</p><p></p><p>If it were a dragon soul, its spiritual power should have already condensed into substance, filling the entire space.</p><p></p><p>This was a divine soul! The divine soul of a human genius, forcibly torn away and then confined in this iron box, imprisoned for who knows how many years.</p><p></p><p>Sensing Ye Xiao's spiritual power, it immediately flew into a rage and let out a roar, preparing to pounce on Ye Xiao.</p><p></p><p>Ye Xiao's spiritual power quickly evaded, and with the invocation of his spiritual power, the Hegemon Saber was instantly unleashed.</p><p></p><p>Boom—! But unfortunately, the spiritual power passed through its body without causing any effect, only leaving a shallow scar on the inner wall of the iron box.</p><p></p><p>The divine soul is a product that transcends the realm of spiritual energy and spiritual power, and it is difficult to deal with it using spiritual energy and spiritual power.</p><p></p><p>It's as if the two are on different dimensions, where the divine soul can harm humans, but humans cannot harm the divine soul with spiritual energy and spiritual power.</p><p></p><p>The only thing that can deal with the divine soul is the divine soul itself!</p><p></p><p>Ye Xiao had never revealed his own divine soul to anyone before.</p><p></p><p>He didn't even know how strong his divine soul was.</p><p></p><p>However, the Golden Book divine soul was so powerful, it shouldn't be too useless.</p><p></p><p>At this moment, the giant dragon divine soul roared and charged towards him again.</p><p></p><p>Ye Xiao took a deep breath and directly unleashed his own divine soul.</p><p></p><p>The Golden Book divine soul was instantly released by him.</p><p></p><p>"Boom—!"</p><p></p><p>"Awooo~!"</p><p></p><p>The giant dragon let out a miserable howl and was immediately suppressed.</p><p></p><p>Ye Xiao was stunned, completely unexpected that the Golden Book divine soul, although only the size of a book, could instantly pin down the giant dragon divine soul, pressing it firmly to the bottom of the space, not even able to struggle.</p><p></p><p>"So strong!"</p><p></p><p>Ye Xiao couldn't help but exclaim, his heart deeply shaken once again.</p><p></p><p>He had seen the divine souls of many people before.</p><p></p><p>Whether it was Qin Yuyan's, Gu Hai's, or even the grand masters like Ouyang Yunzhong and Qin Shenglong, their divine souls were all quite small, about one meter in size.</p><p></p><p>Yet the giant dragon divine soul was so massive, hundreds of meters long, and it was even confined by the Beast God Alliance in this iron box with spatial properties.</p><p></p><p>Now, this powerful divine soul was completely suppressed by the Golden Book divine soul, without even a shred of resistance. Just how powerful must the Golden Book divine soul be? At this moment, Ye Xiao gained a whole new understanding of the strength of the Golden Book divine soul.</p><p></p><p>In the future, if he encounters a confrontation, he can also consider using the Golden Book divine soul to suppress the opponent. It can be considered a very good technique.</p><p></p><p>Afterwards, Ye Xiao descended, and the giant dragon on the ground had completely given up struggling, only its eyes revealing a deep sense of despair and unwillingness.</p><p></p><p>It looked at Ye Xiao, as if it had already resigned itself to its fate, slowly closing its eyes, waiting for Ye Xiao to kill it.</p><p></p><p>But Ye Xiao did not make a move. From the giant dragon divine soul, he seemed to see the former self who had been lying on the sickbed, awaiting the judgment of a terminal illness, and the death that was to come.</p><p></p><p>Despair, helplessness, even if there was unwillingness, there was nothing that could be done.</p><p></p><p>That kind of heartache.</p><p></p><p>Here is the full English translation of the Chinese excerpt:</p><p></p><p>The feeling of being twisted and torn is something that is very difficult for anyone to truly understand and empathize with.</p><p></p><p>Ye Xiao used his spiritual power to scan the dragon's divine soul, where he found the memories of its original owner's life.</p><p></p><p>Scenes of brutal carnage unfolded before Ye Xiao's eyes.</p><p></p><p>The owner of the dragon's divine soul was a young boy from a village that was attacked by the beastmen.</p><p></p><p>The beastmen slaughtered everyone and then extracted and devoured their divine souls to strengthen their own spiritual powers.</p><p></p><p>This is because when the beastmen transform into star beasts, just like humans opening their divine souls, there is a hierarchy of power.</p><p></p><p>Their bloodline power and spiritual power will intermingle, and then an assessment is made.</p><p></p><p>The beastmen absorb the bloodline power from the star beasts and the spiritual power from human divine souls, allowing them to achieve an even more powerful bloodline when they fully transform into star beasts.</p><p></p><p>This is why Ye Xiao had previously encountered the beastmen massacring the village.</p><p></p><p>The young boy's family members were all killed, and he too could not escape the same fate. The Beast God Alliance used secret techniques to extract the dragon's divine soul from his body and seal it in this iron box, likely intending to leave it for a future talented alliance leader to devour and create a dragon-level bloodline.</p><p></p><p>But so far, the Beast God Alliance has not had a leader capable of refining it.</p><p></p><p>It is too powerful!</p><p></p><p>It has far surpassed the strength of ordinary people. If its original owner had not died, it could have grown into a powerhouse beyond the Monarch Realm.</p><p></p><p>What a pity.</p><p></p><p>Ye Xiao reached out and gently caressed the dragon's divine soul.</p><p></p><p>"I am not a beastman, and the Beast God Alliance has already been destroyed by me."</p><p></p><p>The dragon's soul slowly opened its eyes, looking somewhat bewildered and disbelieving at Ye Xiao.</p><p></p><p>Ye Xiao released the binding of the Golden Book's divine soul, as with it, he no longer needed to worry about this dragon's divine soul being able to harm him.</p><p></p><p>"It's true, my divine soul is far stronger than yours, and I have no need to deceive you."</p><p></p><p>The dragon's soul remained silent for a long time, then slowly lowered its head towards Ye Xiao, as a gesture of gratitude.</p><p></p><p>"I can now open the box, but without a physical vessel for your original owner, you will likely dissipate into the air before long."</p><p></p><p>The dragon's soul nodded, already knowing this would be the outcome. Here, it had already lived long enough, unable to seek life nor able to find death.</p><p></p><p>Ye Xiao spoke again, "However, if you wish to live, there may be a chance."</p><p></p><p>At these words, Ye Xiao clearly saw a glimmer of light flash in the dragon's soul's eyes.</p><p></p><p>Indeed, it still did not want to die.</p><p></p><p>After all, any being with intelligence knows how difficult it is to live, and if there is a chance to live, who would not want to?</p><p></p><p>In fact, Ye Xiao had already had some ideas in his mind when he saw the dragon's divine soul.</p><p></p><p>The dragon's divine soul is an intelligent being, and an extremely powerful one at that.</p><p></p><p>If he could place it within the Tang Dao, perhaps it could further elevate the already imperial-grade weapon. In the past, there were many who chose to sacrifice themselves to forge even more powerful weapons. Ye Xiao's Tang Dao, although it had already forged a faint consciousness and could operate on its own, was still like a low-skilled robot, only capable of simple operations.</p><p></p><p>Weapons that reach the Grandmaster level can, through the owner's transmission of spiritual energy, momentarily condense consciousness.</p><p></p><p>Reaching the Imperial-Grade level, they can independently absorb spiritual energy and perform simple operations.</p><p></p><p>If he were to place this powerful dragon's soul inside, the Tang Dao would likely become a completely self-aware living being. At that point, it would surely surpass the existence of an Imperial-Grade weapon.</p><p></p><p>"If you are willing, I would like to integrate you into my weapon as its spirit essence.</p><p></p><p>Of course, you are also free to refuse, I will not force you.</p><p></p><p>But your original owner is already dead, and the only way for you to continue existing in this world is to become a spirit essence."</p><p></p><p>The dragon's soul had not harmed anyone, unlike the likes of Noel Fist and the other star beasts who had caused countless deaths. Ye Xiao would not do anything too extreme to it.</p><p></p><p>The dragon's soul remained silent for a long while, but ultimately nodded its head.</p><p></p><p>Ye Xiao had already avenged it by destroying the Beast God Alliance, which was a great kindness in itself.</p><p></p><p>It was only right that it should repay the favor.</p><p></p><p>Moreover, it also needed to find a vessel to continue living. And another factor was that Ye Xiao was very strong, and as a powerful divine soul, it would only submit to an even greater expert.</p><p></p><p>Likely, there was no one else besides Ye Xiao who would be suitable.</p><p></p><p>A slight smile appeared on Ye Xiao's lips. Success.</p><p></p><p>"Alright, once I have the necessary materials ready, I will begin the refinement. In the meantime, you can stay in this box for a little while longer. It won't be long before you can see the light of day again."</p><p></p><p>The dragon's soul nodded, its eyes filled with hope.</p><p></p><p>Ye Xiao's spiritual power withdrew from the iron box. He did not look at the other iron box, which contained the young boy's essence blood.</p><p></p><p>The Beast God Alliance needed to use the original owner's essence blood to suppress the divine soul's resistance in order to refine it. Because it was the blood of the original owner, the divine soul would be pacified. It was truly a cruel act, akin to using the identity of the master to kill the beloved pet that the master had raised.</p><p></p><p>But for Ye Xiao, this was a tremendous boon.</p><p></p><p>[One more update, 3,000 words.]</p><p></p><p>Thank you to book friends zyhawzy, book friend Dou Mao Cao, book friend Shadow, book friend Mysterious Person, and book friend Cheng Da Cheng for your donations, greatly appreciated.</p><p></p><p>(This chapter is complete.)</p>

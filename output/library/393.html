        <h1>Chapter 393</h1>
        <div class="content">
            <p>Here is the full English translation of the Chinese excerpt:</p><p></p><p>When the experts from the Alliance of a Hundred Tribes tried to rush into the formation and enter the Shen King's tomb, a sudden burst of black-purple mist sprayed out.</p><p></p><p>Pu chi!</p><p></p><p>The person at the very front was instantly corroded into a pile of white bones, with his flesh, blood, and soul all shattered.</p><p></p><p>But the mist was not just a little bit. Its quantity was too much, too great. It had been sealed in this tomb for countless days and months, and had been pent up for countless days and months. Now that it had finally been released, it wanted to surge forth like a bursting river, occupying the entire world!</p><p></p><p>Ning Zhiyuan, who was not far away, saw this scene and his pupils suddenly contracted.</p><p></p><p>One must know that the beings who had just tried to rush into that Shen King's tomb were a few Godly Realm experts from the Alliance of a Hundred Tribes! Even Godly Realm experts could not withstand this poisonous mist for even a second, which shows how terrifying this poisonous mist was.</p><p></p><p>"Shao Yu, retreat quickly! This poisonous mist is deadly dangerous."</p><p></p><p>Unfortunately, the speed of this poisonous mist was simply too fast. He had just shouted out, and in the next second, the poisonous mist had already engulfed him, Ling Shaoyu, and several other experts from the Xuanyuan Clan and the Alliance of a Hundred Tribes.</p><p></p><p>"Damn it!"</p><p></p><p>Cries of agony rang out as the poisonous gas invaded, but in the blink of an eye, less than two seconds, the voices had all disappeared.</p><p></p><p>This was because the poisonous mist had already diffused and diluted a little.</p><p></p><p>One can imagine the terrifying power that would be unleashed if the poisonous mist were to condense together.</p><p></p><p>"Young master!"</p><p></p><p>The experts from the two great families wanted to go in and rescue them, but Song Qingxue immediately stopped them.</p><p></p><p>"Don't go, the poisonous mist is too dangerous. Even Slay God Realm experts might perish. They two should already be beyond help. Even if you rush in to rescue them, it would be futile."</p><p></p><p>"Damn it!"</p><p></p><p>The experts from the two families gritted their teeth in anger.</p><p></p><p>Although Ning Zhiyuan and Ling Shaoyu had the status and identities that would have their essence blood and divine souls stored in the Ning Family, allowing them to be revived using healing techniques, the problem was that if their physical bodies perished, even if they were revived, they would definitely not be able to easily reach their current level of cultivation. Their innate talents might even decline significantly.</p><p></p><p>For top-tier families like theirs, the damage to their groomed direct-line young masters was a major loss.</p><p></p><p>Seeing the poisonous mist continuing to spread endlessly, Song Qingxue and the remaining young masters looked at each other and shouted loudly:</p><p></p><p>"It's no longer safe here, let's retreat for now and see what the situation is like later. Hurry, retreat!"</p><p></p><p>At the order, although the others were unwilling, they could only retreat.</p><p></p><p>The people from the Alliance of a Hundred Tribes naturally did not dare to linger, and immediately withdrew.</p><p></p><p>After all, their lives were the priority.</p><p></p><p>And within that black-purple poisonous mist, there were two faint golden lights, struggling to hold on, flickering on and off, like two weak stars in the deep sea, ready to extinguish at any moment.</p><p></p><p>Those were Ling Shaoyu and Ning Zhiyuan.</p><p></p><p>Their cultivation had definitely not reached the Godly Realm, but due to their special identities, they both possessed special protective treasures that could maintain and isolate the poisonous mist for a short period of time.</p><p></p><p>However, this duration was not long, and their defensive barriers were being corroded by the poisonous mist, emitting sizzling sounds.</p><p></p><p>Some weak poisonous gas had already penetrated their defenses and entered their bodies, causing them to tremble, their faces turning pale and their bodies covered in sweat.</p><p></p><p>"Shaoyu, how do you feel?"</p><p></p><p>"Enough with the nonsense! Can't you feel it yourself? It's bone-chillingly cold."</p><p></p><p>"I never thought we would end up like this. It seems the elders' warnings were correct - there are always life-threatening situations waiting for us out there."</p><p></p><p>"It's fine, we can still be revived."</p><p></p><p>"But after being revived, our cultivation won't be the same as now. It will definitely decline. We don't know how far behind the others we'll be."</p><p></p><p>Ning Zhiyuan smiled bitterly.</p><p></p><p>But what could he do?</p><p></p><p>The starry sky was vast, and there were countless experts. For beings like them, although their identities were noble, once they were separated from their families, they were nothing.</p><p></p><p>As time passed, the corrosion of the poisonous mist became more and more severe, and the consciousness of the two began to gradually slip into a coma, becoming somewhat disoriented.</p><p></p><p>"Ning brother, I... I'm afraid I won't make it. I'll go first."</p><p></p><p>Ning Zhiyuan nodded slightly.</p><p></p><p>"You go first, I'll follow soon."</p><p></p><p>After saying that, he used up his last bit of strength to look towards the direction of the Human Realm.</p><p></p><p>It would probably take his family a long time to revive him, and during that time, he wouldn't be able to come back here. He didn't know if that Sword Immortal would still be here by then.</p><p></p><p>What a pity, not being able to see that monstrous figure!</p><p></p><p>Just at that moment, his already somewhat scattered gaze suddenly caught sight of a bright light rapidly approaching from the direction of the Human Realm, arriving by his side in an instant.</p><p></p><p>"So fast!"</p><p></p><p>Ning Zhiyuan was suddenly jolted awake. Although his consciousness was fading and his vision was blurry, he still strained to look towards the figure.</p><p></p><p>He wanted to see who that was! "Who are you?"</p><p></p><p>His hoarse voice, corroded by the poisonous mist, asked.</p><p></p><p>Here is the full English translation of the Chinese excerpt:</p><p></p><p>A faint murmur.</p><p></p><p>The light that came was none other than Ye Xiao.</p><p></p><p>Because he had just learned the ninth-level divine art of poison - the Poison God's Forbidden Art, he was now in the midst of this poisonous mist without the slightest effect.</p><p></p><p>Hearing the other's voice, he couldn't help but be a little surprised and glanced at the other.</p><p></p><p>"It's actually him."</p><p></p><p>Ye Xiao had seen Ning Zhiyuan more than once.</p><p></p><p>He had a good impression of this person, as he never put on airs and was said to have taken care of his seniors like the Scenery Emperor, the Four Elders, and Betang Ce, and provided them with many excellent resources. It was also because of him that Betang Ce had previously urged him to reveal his identity.</p><p></p><p>After a moment of contemplation, Ye Xiao snapped his fingers and shot out two golden beams that entered the bodies of the two people, then walked straight towards the formation.</p><p></p><p>The Immortality Art was activated!</p><p></p><p>The bodies of the two, which had been corroded by the poisonous mist, were instantly restored.</p><p></p><p>Ling Shaoyu: "(⊙.⊙)!"</p><p></p><p>"What's going on? My consciousness has been restored. Wasn't I dead? Isn't this poisonous mist supposed to be able to corrode the soul as well?"</p><p></p><p>Ning Zhiyuan widened his eyes and tremblingly pointed at Ye Xiao's back.</p><p></p><p>"It was he who saved us!"</p><p></p><p>Ling Shaoyu only then noticed Ye Xiao's figure.</p><p></p><p>Seeing him walking unharmed in the poisonous mist, he couldn't help but have his pupils contract.</p><p></p><p>"My God, who is he? How can he be so powerful? This poisonous mist can't hurt him at all?"</p><p></p><p>Ning Zhiyuan thought for a moment, gritted his teeth, and then cupped his hands towards Ye Xiao's back:</p><p></p><p>"Thank you, sir, for saving our lives. May I ask if you are the Sword Immortal of Jianghai City?"</p><p></p><p>Ling Shaoyu was shocked again, his hair standing on end, and he couldn't help but exclaim:</p><p></p><p>"He's the Sword Immortal? The one you mentioned, the peerless genius of our XuanYuan Clan?"</p><p></p><p>Ye Xiao's voice, modified by spiritual energy, came back faintly.</p><p></p><p>"You two can leave now, my healing art has a limited duration, and you two can only last another minute."</p><p></p><p>With that, he reached out and manipulated the formation, and the formation that Ling Shaoyu and the high-level formation masters of the Hundred Tribes Alliance had spent half a day painstakingly cracking was directly opened.</p><p></p><p>"Fuck!"</p><p></p><p>Ling Shaoyu was so shocked that his jaw almost dropped.</p><p></p><p>He swore he had never seen such a powerful person in his life.</p><p></p><p>Ye Xiao's mastery of formations was simply beyond his imagination, as if it were from an era so distant.</p><p></p><p>As a formation master, no one knew better than him how difficult it was to crack this formation.</p><p></p><p>But Ye Xiao had cracked it, and he had done it so easily! He was simply too monstrous! However, the moment the formation was shattered, even more poisonous mist began to spread, a thick and dense poisonous mist that engulfed Ye Xiao, a rolling black and purple mist whose power was many times stronger than the previous batch that had emerged.</p><p></p><p>The few remaining Clan White Bones that had survived the corrosion of the poisonous mist were instantly reduced to powder and shattered upon contact with this more concentrated poisonous mist.</p><p></p><p>"Be careful!"</p><p></p><p>Ning Zhiyuan couldn't help but cry out in alarm, but he soon realized he was wrong.</p><p></p><p>Because Ye Xiao's figure, in this more concentrated poisonous mist, was also completely unaffected, as steady as Mount Tai, and he was stepping into the Deity King's Tomb.</p><p></p><p>Ning Zhiyuan's mouth corner couldn't help but twitch violently.</p><p></p><p>So monstrous? This guy is already so monstrous that it's superhuman.</p><p></p><p>Ling Shaoyu and Ning Zhiyuan were now like dumb geese, staring wide-eyed at the interior of the mausoleum.</p><p></p><p>He just walked in like that?</p><p></p><p>The poisonous mist couldn't stop him!</p><p></p><p>The formation couldn't stop him either! After all, this was the Deity King's Tomb, not some small-time rogue's backyard.</p><p></p><p>The combined forces of their XuanYuan Clan and the Hundred Tribes Alliance had been forced to retreat, and it was a real headache.</p><p></p><p>But Ye Xiao just went in as easily as if he was going into his own backyard! It was simply unbelievable.</p><p></p><p>"Zhiyuan, is he really the Sword Immortal you mentioned? The powerhouse of the XuanYuan Clan? Possibly even younger than us?"</p><p></p><p>Ning Zhiyuan smiled bitterly:</p><p></p><p>"I'm not too sure either. But if it's not him, why would he bother to save the two of us? And when I just asked him, although he didn't directly answer my question, you should have also seen that he didn't deny it either.</p><p></p><p>So if I'm guessing correctly, it's most likely him."</p><p></p><p>"Are you sure he's one of our XuanYuan Clan? I feel like our XuanYuan Clan doesn't deserve to have such a monstrous genius, you know?"</p><p></p><p>Ning Zhiyuan smiled bitterly again.</p><p></p><p>"How would I know?"</p><p></p><p>Just then, Ling Shaoyu suddenly couldn't help but murmur:</p><p></p><p>"I feel uncomfortable again, let's just get out of here quickly."</p><p></p><p>Second update, 6,000 words.</p><p></p><p>Please recommend votes and monthly votes. </p><p></p><p>Thank you to the reader Listening Wind Chanting Old Man for the reward, greatly appreciated.</p><p></p><p>(This chapter is complete)</p>

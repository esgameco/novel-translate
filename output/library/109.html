        <h1>Chapter 109</h1>
        <div class="content">
            <p>Here is the full English translation of the Chinese excerpt:</p><p></p><p>The flying dagger was continuously absorbing spiritual energy, and Qin Mingfeng couldn't help but exclaim in amazement, "So powerful! This flying dagger is truly extraordinary!</p><p></p><p>The absorption capacity of most master-level weapons is limited. Although I'm only a post-heaven ninth-rank cultivator, I've used many master-level weapons before, but I've never seen one with such power.</p><p></p><p>Normally, the absorption speed of other master-level weapons would start to slow down after reaching a certain level, and eventually stop absorbing spiritual energy completely.</p><p></p><p>But this flying dagger, even up until now, has not shown any signs of slowing down in its absorption of spiritual energy. </p><p></p><p>This means that the craftsmanship in making this flying dagger is far beyond the skills of ordinary weapon forgers."</p><p></p><p>"That powerful?" </p><p></p><p>Qin Yuyan couldn't help but exclaim.</p><p></p><p>Qin Mingfeng smiled, and at this moment, the flying dagger in his hand had turned into a pale golden color, indicating that its charging was complete.</p><p></p><p>He gripped the flying dagger tightly and glanced at the small mountain behind the company window.</p><p></p><p>"If you don't believe me, just look at that small mountain over there. I dare say the power of this dagger can carve a huge gash on that mountain!"</p><p></p><p>He then threw the dagger with a flick of his wrist.</p><p></p><p>The flying dagger transformed into a golden bolt of lightning, shooting out with incredible speed. </p><p></p><p>In the next moment, a thunderous explosion was heard as the small mountain was completely shattered by the dagger.</p><p></p><p>Qin Mingfeng: "(...)!"</p><p>Qin Yuyan: "(_)!"</p><p>Black-haired secretary: "ヾ(o゜_，゜o)ノ!"</p><p></p><p>Seeing the dust and debris of the completely destroyed mountain, Qin Yuyan couldn't help but say softly, "Second uncle, didn't you say the dagger could only carve a huge gash on the mountain? But now the entire mountain has been completely destroyed."</p><p></p><p>Qin Mingfeng wiped the cold sweat from his forehead.</p><p></p><p>"I underestimated it. I didn't expect this flying dagger to have such an amplification effect. In that case, the craftsmanship of the one who forged this dagger is even more impressive than we imagined."</p><p></p><p>The secretary sighed, "President Qin, compensating for such a large mountain is going to cost a lot of money!"</p><p></p><p>Qin Mingfeng cleared his throat and said, "The compensation will be covered by our Qin family. First, tell me where this flying dagger was purchased from?"</p><p></p><p>"It was bought from the Dongfeng Weapon Shop in Jianghai City. That is the largest weapon shop in our Jianghai City. All the weapons and armor from other forging companies are sold through the Dongfeng Weapon Shop, and they are registered before being sold."</p><p></p><p>According to the law, any company publicly selling weapons in the Nine Realms must have the proper qualifications. </p><p></p><p>The purchase of weapons also requires certain standards. Although the prices may be higher, this can prevent unscrupulous weapon forgers or small-time dealers from privately selling substandard weapons.</p><p></p><p>There have been many cases where people were devoured by spirit beasts on the battlefield because their weapons easily broke due to not meeting the standards.</p><p></p><p>This is a bloody lesson. </p><p></p><p>Another reason is to protect the weapon forgers themselves, to prevent malicious people from kidnapping them for their skills, as forgers are not necessarily powerful fighters, and can be easily overpowered even by cultivators of the same level.</p><p></p><p>"Go negotiate the compensation issue, then report back to me. I'll go to the Dongfeng Weapon Shop."</p><p></p><p>"Okay!"</p><p></p><p>The uncle and niece duo jumped out the window, retrieved the flying dagger from the shattered mountain debris, and quickly headed to the Dongfeng Weapon Shop by car.</p><p></p><p>In less than ten minutes, they arrived at the Dongfeng Weapon Shop.</p><p></p><p>The sales manager immediately stepped forward and greeted them, "Hello, how may I assist you?"</p><p></p><p>Qin Mingfeng took out the flying dagger in his hand and said, "Hello,</p><p></p><p>Here is my translation of the Chinese excerpt:</p><p></p><p>"I'd like to ask, do you still have this throwing knife here?" </p><p></p><p>The other person smiled and took out a tablet, took a photo, and began searching. Soon they had the answer.</p><p></p><p>"Yes, we currently have about 13 left. This item just came into our inventory recently, so we don't have many buyers for it yet."</p><p></p><p>"I'll take them all."</p><p></p><p>"Okay, I'll get the rest for you right away."</p><p></p><p>The other person quickly brought the remaining 13 throwing knives to Qin Mingfeng and Qin Yuyuan.</p><p></p><p>Seeing the additional 13 knives, Qin Mingfeng's pupils constricted and he looked at the tray in disbelief, his body even trembling slightly.</p><p></p><p>"This, this is..."</p><p></p><p>"Uncle, what's wrong?" Qin Yuyuan asked, confused.</p><p></p><p>Qin Mingfeng pointed at the knives and said, "Do you know what material these are made of?"</p><p></p><p>Qin Yuyuan raised her eyebrows, even more puzzled.</p><p></p><p>"These are cast from the scales of the Black Scale Snake!"</p><p></p><p>"What did you say?" Qin Yuyuan's heart suddenly raced.</p><p></p><p>Black Scale Snake scales?</p><p></p><p>Qin Mingfeng explained, "These throwing knives, while made with the same craftsmanship, are made of completely different materials. The previous one was indeed cast from high-quality iron, but these are cast from Black Scale Snake scales."</p><p></p><p>"So that means the blacksmith who forged these knives is likely the same powerful cultivator who slew the Black Scale Snake?"</p><p></p><p>"Not necessarily. After all, he is already a master swordsman and healer, it's unlikely he would also be an expert blacksmith. Who could master so many different skills to the highest level? Unless he's not human!</p><p></p><p>But even if this blacksmith isn't him, he should at least be a friend, or at least an acquaintance of that powerful cultivator. </p><p> </p><p>After all, experts would likely respect each other."</p><p></p><p>Thinking of this, he immediately said, "I'll buy all these throwing knives. But I want to know, can you tell me who the blacksmith is?"</p><p></p><p>The sales manager smiled apologetically. "I'm afraid I can't do that. You should know that according to the laws of the Nine Realms, our weapon shop is not allowed to disclose the source of our weapons. All the information is encrypted. Without the blacksmith's permission, revealing his identity could cause him trouble, or even endanger his life."</p><p></p><p>Qin Mingfeng's enthusiasm for finding the expert was immediately extinguished, like a frost-bitten eggplant.</p><p></p><p>"Uncle, let's just forget about it," Qin Yuyuan comforted.</p><p></p><p>Qin Mingfeng gritted his teeth and quietly said, "If you can help me find out where these knives were purchased from, I can give you a reward. Don't worry, I won't reveal that you told me."</p><p></p><p>Qin Yuyuan's expression changed. "Uncle, you can't do that! The laws of the Nine Realms don't allow it! If she can tell you, she can tell others too.</p><p></p><p>Revealing the blacksmith's identity could put his life in danger, even if he's powerful. He could be targeted by evil people, or even angered the expert swordsman who slew the Black Scale Snake. We can't risk an innocent person's life just to satisfy our curiosity!"</p><p></p><p>Qin Mingfeng trembled. "You're right, I've lost my mind. We shouldn't endanger an innocent blacksmith just for our own curiosity."</p>

        <h1>Chapter 411</h1>
        <div class="content">
            <p>Here is the full English translation of the Chinese excerpt:</p><p></p><p>The crowd hurried to work, and another elixir furnace was quickly used to refine the second batch of elixir.</p><p></p><p>"Elder Chen, the second batch of elixir has also been refined."</p><p></p><p>As soon as the voice was heard, Elder Chen immediately rushed over to inspect the elixir ingredients.</p><p></p><p>He picked up an elixir pill, quickly tossing it into his mouth, but after chewing it a couple of times, his expression turned grim again.</p><p></p><p>"It's still not enough. It's still far from reaching this level. What's going on?"</p><p></p><p>He tapped his index finger, continuously knocking on his own forehead, trying to spark a flash of inspiration.</p><p></p><p>Suddenly, he had a moment of enlightenment, but immediately after, a sense of despair washed over him.</p><p></p><p>"It's over! It's over! This time it's completely over!"</p><p></p><p>Saying that, he plopped down on the ground, as if he had lost his mind.</p><p></p><p>The other elixir refiners couldn't help but be completely puzzled.</p><p></p><p>"What's going on? Why is the Grand Master Chen in such a state?"</p><p></p><p>Some of the more experienced elixir refiners took out an elixir pill and tasted it, seemingly understanding the situation, shaking their heads.</p><p></p><p>"Alas!"</p><p></p><p>The crowd let out a deep sigh.</p><p></p><p>"It's a lack of spiritual energy!"</p><p></p><p>"This elixir formula is from the ancient times. Although it is extremely effective in suppressing the Blood Butterfly poison, it was meant to be refined in the primordial era.</p><p></p><p>In the primordial era, the spiritual energy between heaven and earth was abundant, making it easier to refine such elixir. </p><p></p><p>But now, the spiritual energy is vastly different from that time. Moreover, this is the Canglan Star Domain, on the edge of the starry sky, where the spiritual energy is even more scarce.</p><p></p><p>This has resulted in insufficient spiritual energy gathered during the refinement, making it impossible to refine elixir that can match the level of the primordial era.</p><p></p><p>Without being able to refine that level of elixir, there is naturally no way to solve the Blood Butterfly poison."</p><p></p><p>"Does that mean the people infected with the Blood Butterfly poison are doomed to die?"</p><p></p><p>"We are so helpless! As elixir refiners of the Xuanyuan Clan, we can only watch our own clansmen suffer from the poison, powerless to do anything."</p><p></p><p>A deep sense of self-blame weighed heavily on the crowd.</p><p></p><p>After a short while, one of the elixir refiners couldn't help but speak up:</p><p></p><p>"Elder Chen, what should we do now? Young Master Ning is still waiting for our good news."</p><p></p><p>Elder Chen let out a long sigh, getting up from the ground.</p><p></p><p>"At this point, there's nothing we can do. I'll go explain the situation myself. This is ultimately my own inadequacy."</p><p></p><p>"Elder Chen..."</p><p></p><p>The crowd fell silent, not knowing what to say.</p><p></p><p>But at that moment, one of them suddenly spoke up:</p><p></p><p>"Huh, whose elixir is this in the pot?"</p><p></p><p>Everyone's gaze turned to a pot of elixir that looked dull and lifeless.</p><p></p><p>"Why does this elixir have no luster? Has it been refined into a failed elixir?"</p><p></p><p>However, one of the senior masters in the crowd vaguely sensed something unusual. He stepped forward and said, "How strange, although this elixir has no luster to speak of, it is so perfectly square and rectangular. Normally, it shouldn't have any luster at all!"</p><p></p><p>He then picked up an elixir pill and took a bite. The next moment, a golden light mixed with extremely thick spiritual energy burst forth from his mouth.</p><p></p><p>"Good heavens!"</p><p></p><p>He was so excited that he almost dropped the elixir pill in his mouth.</p><p></p><p>"Elder Chen, come quickly! Come quickly!"</p><p></p><p>Elder Chen immediately walked over.</p><p></p><p>"What's going on?"</p><p></p><p>The elixir refiner pointed to the pot of elixir.</p><p></p><p>"The golden light is internalized, and the spiritual energy is condensed to the extreme! This is the pinnacle of supreme elixirs!"</p><p></p><p>"How is this possible?"</p><p></p><p>Elder Chen was shocked and quickly picked up an elixir pill, putting it in his mouth. Immediately, his eyes lit up, and he was overwhelmed with excitement.</p><p></p><p>"This elixir is truly divine!</p><p></p><p>To refine an elixir to this level, surpassing its original grade, the elixir refiner behind this must be one of the top few in the entire starry sky! Who is it?</p><p></p><p>Who refined this elixir?"</p><p></p><p>Elder Chen held the elixir pill in his hand and shouted loudly to the crowd.</p><p></p><p>But no one stepped forward.</p><p></p><p>"Didn't any of you see who did this?"</p><p></p><p>The crowd shook their heads, and Elder Chen couldn't help but feel puzzled.</p><p></p><p>"This is really strange! Such a supreme elixir couldn't have appeared here out of nowhere. It must have been refined by someone! How can we not find the person?"</p><p></p><p>"Elder Chen, what we should be focusing on now is not finding out who refined the elixir, but quickly sending these elixir pills to the hospital.</p><p></p><p>Those infected by the poison are waiting to use them."</p><p></p><p>"Yes, yes, yes, we should hurry and send the elixir pills to the hospital. Quick, pack them in spiritual porcelain bottles and send them out."</p><p></p><p>At the hospital, Ning Zhiyuan was waiting in the ward. The sickly Uncle Ning had just managed to open his eyes.</p><p></p><p>"Uncle, you're awake."</p><p></p><p>Ning Zhiyuan leaned in, and Uncle Ning spoke in a weak voice, "Don't come near me!"</p><p></p><p>Here is the full English translation of the Chinese excerpt:</p><p></p><p>Ning Zhiyuan nodded, he knew how formidable this venom was.</p><p></p><p>"Second Uncle, I've already had Master Chen and the others hurry to research and refine a medicinal pill, they will definitely be able to treat you."</p><p></p><p>Uncle Ning chuckled, then shook his head.</p><p></p><p>"The chances are slim. The Blood Butterfly was an extremely troublesome venom even in ancient times, it's very difficult to completely eradicate. </p><p></p><p>Although Master Chen is the most powerful alchemist in our clan, even he may not be able to handle this terrifying ancient venom.</p><p></p><p>This time, I have a high chance of not making it through.</p><p></p><p>But you don't need to be too sad. When my physical body and spiritual soul die, the clan can use the essence blood and spiritual soul stored in the clan's ancestral hall to revive me."</p><p></p><p>Ning Zhiyuan felt quite sorrowful in his heart. </p><p></p><p>Although what Second Uncle said was correct, in reality, after such a revival, the loss of essence blood and spiritual soul would greatly hinder his future prospects in the martial dao.</p><p></p><p>"Second Uncle, please don't say that. Until the very end, no one knows what will ultimately happen."</p><p></p><p>"What I want to talk to you about now is not this matter, Zhiyuan. You came out this time to temper yourself, the most important thing is to cultivate your character, so that you can stand on your own in the future.</p><p></p><p>Promise me, if in at most two more days, Master Chen still hasn't completed the medicinal pill, then you must act, eliminate all those infected by the venom, don't leave a single one behind. </p><p></p><p>I know you are a good child, and you definitely won't have the heart to strike down your own clansmen.</p><p></p><p>But for the benefit of the entire clan, you must make a choice.</p><p>If the Blood Butterfly is not eliminated, the Ning Clan members across the Nine Realms will most likely be wiped out."</p><p></p><p>Ning Zhiyuan's face turned grave as he nodded. He knew that Second Uncle's proposal was for his own good.</p><p></p><p>However, at this moment, several figures suddenly rushed in quickly.</p><p></p><p>"Young Master Ning, the medicinal pill has arrived."</p><p></p><p>Ning Zhiyuan was overjoyed.</p><p></p><p>"So fast? How's the effect?"</p><p></p><p>"Don't worry, we tried the medicinal pill before we came, and there are already people outside who have taken it, the effect is surprisingly good."</p><p></p><p>"Good! Quickly, give it to my Second Uncle."</p><p></p><p>Master Chen immediately gave Ning Yicheng a medicinal pill, and in the next moment, a layer of golden light emerged on Ning Yicheng's body.</p><p></p><p>The golden light scanned him, and soon Ning Yicheng coughed up a mouthful of blood. Master Chen raised his hand, gathering the spiritual energy to collect the blood, then released flames to incinerate it, which soon let out a violent, agonized scream, turning into a pile of ashes.</p><p></p><p>As for Ning Yicheng, he also quickly recovered his vigorous spirit and sat up from the sickbed.</p><p></p><p>"I'm actually cured. The speed of this medicinal pill is a bit too fast, isn't it?"</p><p></p><p>He couldn't help but exclaim in joyful surprise.</p><p></p><p>Ning Zhiyuan also immediately bowed deeply to Master Chen.</p><p></p><p>"Thank you, Master Chen! This matter is all thanks to you, otherwise I really wouldn't know what to do."</p><p></p><p>Master Chen waved his hand.</p><p></p><p>"Young Master Ning, you've misunderstood. It was not this old man who refined the medicinal pill, but someone else."</p><p></p><p>Ning Zhiyuan was stunned, and he looked at his Second Uncle, puzzled:</p><p></p><p>"How is that possible? In the Canglan Star Domain, there shouldn't be anyone whose alchemy skills are stronger than yours, right?"</p><p></p><p>Master Chen shook his head again.</p><p></p><p>"This old man has also had his eyes opened today! I've always said that there are people outside of people, and heavens outside of heavens. I never believed it, thinking that in the entire starry sky, only the top-ranked Godly Alchemists would have the level to surpass me.</p><p></p><p>But unexpectedly, today someone has taught me a lesson.</p><p></p><p>His alchemy level is far beyond my reach.</p><p></p><p>No, saying that seems to be insulting his level. I should say, I'm not even qualified to carry his shoes!"</p><p></p><p>"What!" </p><p></p><p>Ning Zhiyuan and Ning Yicheng were shocked. They were already stunned enough when Master Chen said the medicinal pill was not made by him.</p><p></p><p>But now, Master Chen was giving the other party such a high evaluation.</p><p></p><p>This was simply unbelievable! "Master Chen, who is this person? Can you introduce him to us?"</p><p></p><p>Master Chen shook his head.</p><p></p><p>"You ask me who he is? I don't know either. Because I've never even seen him.</p><p></p><p>We had already failed in refining the medicinal pill, and this old man was even prepared to apologize to the Young Master.</p><p></p><p>But unexpectedly, a cauldron of medicinal pill suddenly appeared in our alchemy room, we don't know who refined it or who placed it there."</p><p></p><p>Ning Yicheng's face turned grave as he pondered deeply:</p><p></p><p>"Although Master Chen's main focus is on alchemy, and his combat strength is not strong, but he has already cultivated for several hundred years and reached the Slay God Realm First Stage.</p><p></p><p>And there are other alchemists in the alchemy room as well.</p><p></p><p>For this person to be able to place the medicinal pill there without anyone noticing, his cultivation must be extraordinary as well!"</p><p></p><p>Master Chen nodded.</p><p></p><p>"Yicheng is right, this person not only has impressive alchemy skills that command respect, but his cultivation is also unfathomably deep, terrifyingly powerful.</p><p></p><p>If possible, this old man would really like to meet him!"</p><p></p><p>At this moment, Ning Zhiyuan couldn't help but slowly speak:</p><p></p><p>"Could it be... the Sword Immortal?"</p><p></p><p>One more, three thousand.</p><p></p><p>(This chapter is complete)</p>

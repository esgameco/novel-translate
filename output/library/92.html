        <h1>Chapter 92</h1>
        <div class="content">
            <p>Here is the full English translation of the Chinese excerpt:</p><p></p><p>Dou Tianyu stood behind him and carefully spoke up:</p><p></p><p>"Uncle, just now the defense team received news that a star beast has been discovered in the library. Based on the classification, it seems to be from the silver fox star beast clan."</p><p></p><p>"Silver fox, huh? I see." </p><p></p><p>Dou Changfeng calmly uttered a sentence, but his gaze carried a few more hints of gravity.</p><p></p><p>"You may withdraw. There is a guest arriving, so it's not appropriate for you to be here."</p><p></p><p>"Yes, sir!"</p><p></p><p>Dou Tianyu responded, although he didn't know exactly what had happened, he trusted his uncle would not harm him.</p><p></p><p>Soon, a gust of wind swept through, causing the plants in the courtyard to sway.</p><p></p><p>The edges of Dou Changfeng's robe danced in the wind, giving him an ethereal, immortal-like appearance.</p><p></p><p>"Dou Changfeng, it's been a while~."</p><p></p><p>A voice suddenly reached his ears, carrying a mix of nostalgia, resentment, killing intent, and a hint of affection.</p><p></p><p>Hiding inside the house, Dou Tianyu peeked through the crack in the door, his heart suddenly pounding.</p><p></p><p>He could hardly believe his eyes.</p><p></p><p>In the courtyard, a fashionably dressed young woman with bare feet had silently arrived. </p><p></p><p>But what shocked Dou Tianyu was not just her appearance, but the six silver-white fox tails behind her.</p><p></p><p>She was a demonic beast, and an extraordinarily powerful shape-shifting one at that. Dou Changfeng sighed softly.</p><p></p><p>"Youwei, you shouldn't have come back. Star beasts and humans are fundamentally opposed. The silver fox clan and humans have always kept their distance. By venturing into the human realm, you will inevitably invite human suspicion and hostility towards the silver fox clan."</p><p></p><p>"Hmph! Spare me the pretense. Back then, when I, the silver fox clan princess, never harmed a soul and even gave birth to a son for your human kind, you still killed her, didn't you? From that day on, the silver fox clan will no longer remain neutral.</p><p></p><p>The enmity between humans and the silver fox clan has already become set in stone."</p><p></p><p>A hint of gloom flashed across Dou Changfeng's eyes.</p><p></p><p>"Does it really have to come to this irreconcilable conflict?"</p><p></p><p>"Don't you feel ashamed saying that? It's the narrow-mindedness and ignorant foolishness of humans that created this situation, not the silver fox clan."</p><p></p><p>Dou Changfeng took a deep breath.</p><p></p><p>"You're right, but as a human grand master, I absolutely cannot allow the silver fox clan to run amok on human territory without control. </p><p></p><p>If you don't leave the Nine Provinces, then I'll have to take action."</p><p></p><p>"Then come and try."</p><p></p><p>Youwei raised a palm to strike at Dou Changfeng, and he likewise raised his hand to counterattack. </p><p></p><p>The two palms collided, instantly causing the surrounding spiritual energy realm to be violently exploded. The shockwaves turned into raging winds that scattered in all directions.</p><p></p><p>The city lord's mansion, built with special materials and exceptionally sturdy, was instantly uprooted.</p><p></p><p>"Uncle!" </p><p></p><p>Dou Tianyu cried out in alarm, as the other staff members also turned deathly pale with fear.</p><p></p><p>Dou Changfeng's gaze flickered, and this momentary distraction was firmly seized by Youwei.</p><p></p><p>A surge of spiritual pressure erupted from her palm, the immense power instantly rebounding against Dou Changfeng.</p><p></p><p>"Pu-!" </p><p></p><p>Dou Changfeng coughed up a mouthful of fresh blood, his body immediately flying back like a kite with its string cut.</p><p></p><p>Youwei did not kill him, but after landing that devastating blow, she flashed away like a stream of light.</p><p></p><p>"If I find the princess's son, then the Jianghai City will be spared. But if anything happens to him, then the entire Jianghai City will perish with him!"</p><p></p><p>Dou Tianyu hurriedly ran over to support the fallen Dou Changfeng.</p><p></p><p>"Uncle, what do we do now?"</p><p></p><p>Here is the full English translation of the Chinese excerpt:</p><p></p><p>"What should we do?" </p><p></p><p>Changfeng's face turned pale, and he let out a long sigh.</p><p></p><p>"Notify Nangong Ling to stop hunting that silver fox bloodline. Once she finds him, he should leave."</p><p></p><p>"Yes."</p><p></p><p>At the same time, a squad of garrison members were chasing a silver fox through the streets and alleys of Jianghai City in the night.</p><p></p><p>"Catch it, hurry, don't let it get away." The silver fox spirit beast, startled, could only flee desperately, causing chaos on the street.</p><p></p><p>When it reached the entrance of a small alley, suddenly a great force dragged it into the darkness.</p><p></p><p>"Roarâ€”!"</p><p></p><p>It let out a threatening low growl, but when it saw the other party's true appearance, it immediately quieted down.</p><p></p><p>Subsequently, its body transformed back into a human form in a faint white glow.</p><p></p><p>It was Ning Yuhen.</p><p></p><p>His expression was gloomy, with a hint of pain.</p><p></p><p>"Master!"</p><p></p><p>Ye Xiao spoke calmly:</p><p></p><p>"This is not the place to talk, let's leave first."</p><p></p><p>With that, Ye Xiao turned and left, and Ning Yuhen gritted his teeth and followed.</p><p></p><p>The garrison members passing by the alley did not enter, as the alley had been shielded by Ye Xiao's spiritual power.</p><p></p><p>The two returned to Ye Xiao's residence, and Ning Yuhen looked dejected, with a touch of guilt.</p><p></p><p>"I'm sorry, master, I lied to you."</p><p></p><p>Ning Yuhen's tone was slightly tearful, showing his inner turmoil.</p><p></p><p>"Everyone has their own little secrets."</p><p></p><p>Ye Xiao's expression remained calm, showing no signs of anger.</p><p></p><p>Ning Yuhen was a bit puzzled:</p><p></p><p>"Master, aren't you angry? I hid my identity from you."</p><p></p><p>Ye Xiao tossed him a can of Sprite and opened one for himself.</p><p></p><p>After taking a few sips, Ye Xiao finally spoke:</p><p></p><p>"Have you ever wanted to harm me?"</p><p></p><p>Ning Yuhen was startled and quickly shook his head.</p><p></p><p>"How could I dare to harm you, master? You've been as kind to me as an elder brother, I'm grateful to you."</p><p></p><p>"If that's the case, then it's settled, right?"</p><p></p><p>"Master."</p><p></p><p>Ning Yuhen's eyes reddened again.</p><p></p><p>Heaven knows how much he needed someone to care for and acknowledge him at this moment, even if it was just a little.</p><p></p><p>Otherwise, his state of mind might truly fall into the demonic path, becoming a crazed and murderous spirit beast.</p><p></p><p>"What are your plans next?"</p><p></p><p>Ning Yuhen's heart was lifted again.</p><p></p><p>"I can feel a powerful force approaching me. Although I don't know what it represents, I can sense that it's terrifying! Extremely terrifying!"</p><p></p><p>"A powerful force?"</p><p></p><p>Ye Xiao raised his eyebrows slightly, and as soon as he finished speaking, Ning Yuhen started trembling again.</p><p></p><p>"It's here! It's here!"</p><p></p><p>With that, his body began to involuntarily tremble, and silver-white fur started to appear on him.</p><p></p><p>Nine silver fox phantoms flickered behind him from time to time.</p><p></p><p>"Master, I'm sorry, I can't drag you into this."</p><p></p><p>Ning Yuhen let out a scream and no longer suppressed himself, transforming into a nine-tailed silver fox and fleeing rapidly from Ye Xiao's courtyard.</p><p></p><p>But as soon as he left, a massive force descended from the sky, trapping him.</p><p></p><p>(End of this chapter)</p>

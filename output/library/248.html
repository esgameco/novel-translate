        <h1>Chapter 248</h1>
        <div class="content">
            <p>Here is the full English translation of the Chinese excerpt:</p><p></p><p>"I really don't know how this waste can be considered one of the three great generals along with us two demigod beasts. Just thinking about it makes me feel embarrassed."</p><p></p><p>"Anyway, complaining won't do any good. For the sake of the Tiger God's plan, we still need to find him."</p><p></p><p>"I'll sense the place where he disappeared first, then go look for him. While I'm at it, I'll also try to find the trace of that human emperor's bloodline that just appeared."</p><p></p><p>On Ye Xiao's side, after returning, he first checked the things harvested from the cultivation farm over the past month.</p><p></p><p>There were quite a few things harvested, but unfortunately, their value was not enough.</p><p></p><p>Or rather, they were far from meeting the standard for him now.</p><p></p><p>In the past, as a Transcendent Sovereign, he could supplement his vital energy by consuming star beasts at the same level. That was acceptable.</p><p></p><p>But now, he has become a Monarch realm expert! The energy required by a Monarch realm expert is at least ten times more than that of a Transcendent Sovereign.</p><p></p><p>These Innate Seventh, Eighth, and Ninth Grade star beasts are like mere stardust to him, not enough to satisfy his hunger at all.</p><p></p><p>Ye Xiao rubbed his temples and used his divine sense to refine all these things into a medicinal pill.</p><p></p><p>Normally, refining a medicinal pill requires star cores.</p><p></p><p>Ye Xiao's method was equivalent to fusing all the flesh and blood into a blood pearl, which strictly speaking, was not a true medicinal pill.</p><p></p><p>It just made it more convenient for him to consume and absorb all the essence within.</p><p></p><p>Even so, the harvest accumulated over an entire month was still not much.</p><p></p><p>A drop in the bucket.</p><p></p><p>But even a tiny mosquito is still a piece of meat.</p><p></p><p>For Ye Xiao, who has already reached the Monarch realm and needs a massive amount of vital energy to break through to the Emperor realm, it still has some use.</p><p></p><p>However, Ye Xiao indeed needs to come up with some other plans.</p><p></p><p>Currently, he has two plans.</p><p></p><p>One is more realistic, and the other is less so, but still has a bit of a chance.</p><p></p><p>The less realistic one is to capture a few demigod-level or even true divine beast-level star beasts.</p><p></p><p>The reason why this is less realistic is that to achieve this plan, he needs to find demigods and divine beasts.</p><p></p><p>The problem is that these two types are hard to come by.</p><p></p><p>On the surface of the earth, the strongest seem to be only Monarch realm experts, and they are human.</p><p></p><p>As for star beasts, even if there are Monarchs, they have been expelled or slaughtered.</p><p></p><p>Humans will definitely not keep divine beast-level star beasts, as that would be too unstable and dangerous. If they lose control, it could be a disaster for several countries and billions of people! As for demigods, although not as hard to find as divine beasts, they are still not easy to come by either. Probably no more than the number of fingers on one hand in the entire world. At least, there don't seem to be any in the Nine Provinces for now.</p><p></p><p>But even though this plan is not very realistic, if he can find them, it would be incredibly time and cost-effective. With his ability to fight beyond his level, he can subdue them in no time. After capturing them, he can just lock them up in the cultivation farm and harvest their flesh and blood daily to supplement his vital energy, blissfully.</p><p></p><p>The second plan is more realistic but will take a longer time to achieve.</p><p></p><p>That is, to cultivate the star beasts currently in his cultivation farm, not just simply harvesting their flesh, but truly cultivating them! Like cultivating wheat and rice, allowing them to grow from seeds to mature fruits.</p><p></p><p>In other words, to push all of them to the level of demigods or divine beasts.</p><p></p><p>This is relatively more realistic, first because he already has the "seeds", which are the star beasts, and he only needs to find ways to fertilize, water, and raise their cultivation.</p><p></p><p>"Raising livestock still requires investment, huh," Ye Xiao sighed softly.</p><p></p><p>He sank his consciousness into the storage ring and took out a bit of honey to drink.</p><p></p><p>"Hmm?"</p><p></p><p>After taking a sip, Ye Xiao felt the taste was a bit off.</p><p></p><p>It wasn't that the honey had gone bad, as the preservation formation he set up in the storage ring would prevent that.</p><p></p><p>It was that the honey had settled, concentrating the spiritual energy and essence within.</p><p></p><p>Compared to before, it provided even more spiritual energy!</p><p></p><p>"Interesting."</p><p></p><p>Coincidentally, Ye Xiao had been thinking about a problem earlier.</p><p></p><p>He had established such a large flower field, and Susanna the bee was refining so much honey every day, but there was no way he could drink it all.</p><p></p><p>Honey is the best-tasting and sweetest, but he couldn't just drink it like water, his taste buds wouldn't be able to handle it.</p><p></p><p>However, if he were to brew it into wine, and condense the abundant spiritual energy within into a concentrated form, even though he is a Monarch, the improvement he would gain would still be quite significant.</p><p></p><p>Perfect!</p><p></p><p>In that case, could Mumu's milk also be processed into compressed milk tablets?</p><p></p><p>Eating one, he could supplement a large amount of spiritual energy? But it's not that simple.</p><p></p><p>Because the honey is produced by Susanna's foraging, while Mumu's milk is something he has to squeeze out himself.</p><p></p><p>Honey doesn't consume Susanna's vital energy, but Mumu's milk does require him to expend a large amount of his own vital energy.</p><p></p><p>If he squeezes her dry, leaving her deflated, it would be a case of over-exploitation with nothing left for the future.</p><p></p><p>He needs to think of a new method.</p><p></p><p>After a night of contemplation, a series of production plans had formed in Ye Xiao's mind.</p><p></p><p>Here is the full English translation of the Chinese excerpt:</p><p></p><p>He was born.</p><p></p><p>Early the next morning, Ye Xiao rushed to the library, having gotten up a little earlier than usual.</p><p></p><p>This way, before going to work, he first came to the place of the seal. The group of star beasts, who had been idly chatting, were startled when they saw him coming, and immediately retreated to the back wall.</p><p></p><p>This guy had clearly told them before that he generally didn't come here, but if he did, it would definitely be no good.</p><p></p><p>"Mr. Ye, why do you have time to come over today?" </p><p></p><p>Noel Fei rubbed his tentacles, asking cautiously and in a flattering manner.</p><p></p><p>Ye Xiao spoke indifferently:</p><p></p><p>"I came today to discuss some things with you."</p><p></p><p>The hearts of the star beasts immediately sank.</p><p></p><p>Damn it.</p><p></p><p>Whenever this guy said he wanted to discuss something, they didn't even need to use their big toes to guess, they could tell.</p><p></p><p>It definitely wouldn't be good news.</p><p></p><p>"Don't worry, it's good news!" </p><p></p><p>Ye Xiao looked at their expressions and comforted them with a smile.</p><p></p><p>But it was obvious that no one believed his words.</p><p></p><p>To believe this guy's words, their brains must have been waterlogged.</p><p></p><p>Ye Xiao didn't waste any more time and directly told them, "I want to make some adjustments to the farming work.</p><p></p><p>In the past, I forced you to give me blood, essence, honey, eggs, milk and so on. Starting from today, on the basis of what you originally gave me, if anyone is willing to give me more, I can provide them with certain help to greatly improve their cultivation.</p><p></p><p>For example, to raise their cultivation to a higher level, even to the standard of a semi-divine beast."</p><p></p><p>Of course, Ye Xiao could force them. But if he forced them, although they didn't dare to openly resist him, they would set traps for him in secret.</p><p></p><p>For example, not being so diligent in paying their tributes.</p><p></p><p>What Ye Xiao wanted was for them to work hard and actively pay their tributes.</p><p></p><p>Just like how capitalists treat workers, the more you do, the more your cultivation will improve.</p><p></p><p>The more your cultivation improves, the more contributions you make to me.</p><p></p><p>In general, it's to make them voluntarily and actively contribute blood, flesh, and other essences to the maximum.</p><p></p><p>This is much better than forcing them.</p><p></p><p>It's like upgrading the original small-scale peasant economy to a modern factory model, using capitalist enticement and exploitation methods to make them work harder.</p><p></p><p>The group of star beasts couldn't help but hold their breath.</p><p></p><p>The entire farm became extremely quiet.</p><p></p><p>They simply couldn't believe their ears.</p><p></p><p>Was this guy joking with them? Or was he going to use them for fun? He wanted to improve their strength and in return get more from them.</p><p></p><p>Hearing this, it just sounded like a joke, didn't it?</p><p></p><p>Of course, the star beasts didn't doubt Ye Xiao.</p><p></p><p>Because they had to admit that although this guy looked very hateful, he was after all a super expert.</p><p></p><p>If he wanted to forcibly plunder more resources from them, the star beasts, he only needed to use force.</p><p></p><p>As long as they didn't want to die, they had to obediently listen to him.</p><p></p><p>However, now he was going against the norm and discussing it with them, which was worth pondering.</p><p></p><p>"Mr. Ye, you're not joking with us, are you?"</p><p></p><p>Ye Xiao smiled slightly.</p><p></p><p>"Do you think I have the time to joke with you? Starting from today, this condition officially takes effect.</p><p></p><p>I will go and see later how to accelerate the improvement of your cultivation.</p><p></p><p>I hope everyone will enthusiastically sign up! Quickly improve your own strength!"</p><p></p><p>After speaking, Ye Xiao turned and left, leaving the seal.</p><p></p><p>The other star beasts immediately gathered together.</p><p></p><p>"Brothers, do you think this matter is a trick? He actually dares to use the method of improving our cultivation to exchange for our blood and flesh? Is he crazy? Doesn't he know a little bit? If our cultivation is improved, his formation won't be able to suppress us anymore. What will we do when we escape?"</p><p></p><p>Noel Fei shook his head.</p><p></p><p>"I feel that the matter is not so simple. Did you notice anything a little strange just now?"</p><p></p><p>"What's the matter?"</p><p></p><p>"His aura is gone! We can't feel his aura at all. Before, although he was very strong, we could clearly sense his aura. It was at the Innate Ninth Grade!"</p><p></p><p>At these words, the other star beasts were suddenly startled.</p><p></p><p>"That's right, if Noel Fei senior hadn't said it, we really wouldn't have noticed this point. Just now when he came down, I really didn't feel any aura at all.</p><p></p><p>If it wasn't for his figure appearing in front of me, I might not have even felt him coming near me."</p><p></p><p>The group of star beasts suddenly shuddered, their eyes revealing a terrified expression.</p>

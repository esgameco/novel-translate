        <div class="content">
            <p>Here is the full English translation of the Chinese excerpt:</p><p></p><p>"Ye Xiao, are you really sure about this? With your talent, if you join one of the factions, you will likely gain access to massive resources and see your strength rise much faster."</p><p></p><p>Ye Xiao shook his head.</p><p></p><p>"No need, I'll maintain on my own for now, and we can discuss it again in the future."</p><p></p><p>"Alright, since that's how you feel, I won't say more. If you have any thoughts in the future, feel free to contact me anytime."</p><p></p><p>Ye Xiao nodded, about to turn and leave, when Beitang Ce called out to him.</p><p></p><p>"Wait a moment."</p><p></p><p>He took a small stone out of the drawer and tossed it to Ye Xiao.</p><p></p><p>"Throw away your broken phone, no one will be using network communications anymore. This is a Thought Stone - just input a bit of spiritual energy and it can be activated, unaffected by the magnetic fields caused by spiritual energy fluctuations, even in battle. </p><p></p><p>It also has functions like photography, video recording, and timing.</p><p></p><p>These new things are the future trend."</p><p></p><p>Ye Xiao nodded, not paying it much mind.</p><p></p><p>In the world of the Martial Dao, technology itself is merely a supplementary existence, not the mainstream.</p><p></p><p>The highest-level warriors in the human realm were at most at the Emperor Realm, and there were only a handful of King Realm experts on the surface. Even a great master in Jianghai City was an extraordinary existence. So communication networks still held some value.</p><p></p><p>Now, with Shenzu experts everywhere and great masters as common as dogs, just a stirring of spiritual energy would affect magnetic fields and signals, rendering communication networks completely useless.</p><p></p><p>As for not choosing to join a sect, Ye Xiao's reasoning was simple.</p><p></p><p>These factions were likely not very strong within the XuanYuan Clan. If he joined and displayed his heaven-defying talents, it would likely bring him great trouble.</p><p></p><p>Even if they didn't do anything to him, who could guarantee that stronger powers wouldn't covet his talents? And could they really protect him then?</p><p></p><p>As the saying goes, "An innocent man is guilty for possessing a rare treasure." </p><p></p><p>Before he had the ability to fully protect himself, it was best not to expose his full prowess.</p><p></p><p>But the most important reason was that Ye Xiao didn't actually need their cultivation resources.</p><p></p><p>The resources he had on hand were far more abundant than theirs.</p><p></p><p>The Divine Book of the Spirit could synthesize Emperor Techniques into Divine Techniques, and in the future, when he broke through to the Divine Realm, he might even be able to synthesize Divine Techniques into even higher-level cultivation methods.</p><p></p><p>So from this perspective, he didn't lack any cultivation techniques.</p><p></p><p>However, there was one thing Ye Xiao was very curious about - the hierarchical levels of Divine Techniques.</p><p></p><p>There should be rankings even among Divine Techniques, and above the Divine Realm, there should also be rankings.</p><p></p><p>He needed to understand this information clearly in the future.</p><p></p><p>In the coming days, the various XuanYuan Clan factions completely took over the five major regions of the Nine Provinces.</p><p></p><p>The Shenmu Academy took control of the region where Jianghai City was located.</p><p></p><p>The city was still managed using the old methods, as the original administrative system of the Nine Provinces was learned from the ancestors of the human race, passed down from the XuanYuan Clan.</p><p></p><p>The city was divided into three parts: administration, academy, and martial arts library.</p><p></p><p>Apparently, the martial arts library was not called a martial arts library in the XuanYuan Clan, but rather a Sutra Pavilion.</p><p></p><p>But to facilitate management, they still retained the name martial arts library and added a batch of new cultivation techniques.</p><p></p><p>The lowest level were Patriarch-rank techniques, then Emperor Techniques, and a few rare Divine Techniques.</p><p></p><p>The method of transfer was that they had constructed a teleportation array between this human realm and the star region where the XuanYuan Clan resided.</p><p></p><p>This allowed them to quickly and conveniently transport the XuanYuan Clan's high-level cultivation techniques and resources.</p><p></p><p>Due to the improved cultivation technique grades, the requirements for the library's management staff were also raised.</p><p></p><p>For example, to become a manager, one had to be at least at the Patriarch Realm.</p><p></p><p>This was no problem for Ye Xiao - he just needed to slightly raise his cultivation, and then outwardly claim to be a Patriarch expert. Problem solved.</p><p></p><p>The new manager of the Jianghai City library was a female Emperor Realm cultivator, a top expert of the Three Dragons Emperor Realm. But Ye Xiao had already cultivated to the Sixteen Dragons Emperor Realm, far surpassing her, so she couldn't see through his true cultivation.</p><p></p><p>In addition to this, the city also brought in some XuanYuan Clan cultivators.</p><p></p><p>They weren't at the Emperor Realm, as even for the Clan, they couldn't have everything handled by Emperor Realm experts.</p><p></p><p>The majority were Shenzu-level experts, here to do some training work.</p><p></p><p>For example, instilling a sense of clan identity - in simple terms, propaganda to make everyone love and be loyal to the XuanYuan Clan, and first be loyal to the Shenmu Academy.</p><p></p><p>They also shared some history of the XuanYuan Clan and their current situation.</p><p></p><p>For instance, the XuanYuan Clan ranks 19th among all the star races, and there had once been a group of heroes and super experts that shook the ages.</p><p></p><p>Aside from that, there was also information about the Clan's cultivation system.</p><p></p><p>Basically, below the Divine Realm, the cultivation systems were the same, as the human race's cultivation system was surely based on the ones from the star realm.</p><p></p><p>As for the ranks above the Divine Realm, the details...</p><p></p><p>Here is the full English translation of the Chinese excerpt:</p><p></p><p>Leaf Xiao had never heard of "division" before.</p><p></p><p>Above the divine realm, there are four levels of cultivation: Divine Warrior Realm, Divine Slayer Realm, Divine King Realm, and Divine Emperor Realm. But it was only after the explanation of the training teacher that Leaf Xiao understood that the existences above those four realms are not as numerous as one might think, even within the divine clan.</p><p></p><p>The majority are still those below the Divine Warrior Realm.</p><p></p><p>The significance of the divine clan is simply because some of their ancestors had reached the Divine Emperor realm, fully activating the divine bloodline of their lineage, making their descendants stronger in cultivation than ordinary people.</p><p></p><p>In other words, they are an enhanced version of the human race.</p><p></p><p>If for a very long time, no one in this clan continues to break through the Divine Emperor realm, then the divine bloodline will gradually fade away, and the potential of their descendants will gradually decrease.</p><p></p><p>It's just like the Xuanyuan ancestor of this world, after thousands of years of decline, his descendants have already degenerated into ordinary humans, with very few able to awaken the divine blood.</p><p></p><p>The so-called imperial bloodline that Qin Yuyan and the others belonged to were extremely rare lucky stars.</p><p></p><p>But as time goes on, sooner or later, some of them will completely lose their divine blood, until the point where no one can continue to cultivate the martial dao.</p><p></p><p>If one wants to prolong this, they would need someone to advance to the Divine Emperor realm, or have someone in their own clan break through to a higher existence, such as the Divine King realm, which can greatly slow down the degeneration of the bloodline. Of course, this can only delay it, to truly preserve it, one must cultivate to the Divine Emperor realm.</p><p></p><p>Then there are the cultivation techniques.</p><p></p><p>The divine clan's cultivation techniques are divided into those below the divine art and those above the divine art.</p><p></p><p>Those below the divine art are the same as in the human world, while those above the divine art are divided into one-star to nine-star divine arts.</p><p></p><p>Finally, there are some common cultivation knowledge, such as the usage and explanation of Thought Stones and the like.</p><p></p><p>The teacher who was training Leaf Xiao and the others was surnamed Zhang, an elder who was a divine sect master from the Xuanyuan divine clan. Despite his high status, he was very down-to-earth and got along well with the trainees.</p><p></p><p>Occasionally, he would also share some private lessons, teaching some cultivation methods or everyday knowledge of the Xuanyuan divine clan.</p><p></p><p>One month later... "Alright, students, today's training ends here. Starting from tomorrow, the training will officially end, and I will be transferred to the branch school of the Divine Wood Academy in Jianghai City to start teaching there.</p><p></p><p>If you have any questions in the future, you can always go there to ask me.</p><p></p><p>Now I declare the training is over."</p><p></p><p>After the training ended, Teacher Zhang left the library, and Leaf Xiao quickly caught up to him.</p><p></p><p>"Teacher Zhang, please wait a moment."</p><p></p><p>"Leaf Xiao, what's the matter?"</p><p></p><p>"I want to ask you about some questions."</p><p></p><p>"Go ahead."</p><p></p><p>Teacher Zhang walked forward with a stooped back, his hands clasped behind him, holding his own book.</p><p></p><p>Leaf Xiao walked beside him and said:</p><p></p><p>"Previously, you mentioned the levels of cultivation techniques, saying that the cultivation techniques of the Xuanyuan divine clan range from one-star divine art to nine-star divine art."</p><p></p><p>Teacher Zhang nodded.</p><p></p><p>"Yes! The more stars a divine art has, the better it naturally is."</p><p></p><p>"So, is there anything even more powerful above the divine arts?"</p><p></p><p>"There is, but those cultivation techniques are basically very few, and only those with the greatest talents in this world have the opportunity to master them.</p><p></p><p>If one is not an absolute genius, even if they obtain such a technique, it would be useless.</p><p></p><p>Forcibly cultivating it may even directly cause their meridians to explode and die.</p><p></p><p>But the majority won't have their meridians explode, because if they are not geniuses, they may not even be able to understand it."</p><p></p><p>"What kind of cultivation technique is it?"</p><p></p><p>"The Ancient Primal Techniques!"</p><p></p><p>When Teacher Zhang said this, his face revealed a deep solemnity, and his eyes were filled with reverence.</p><p></p><p>Leaf Xiao inwardly thought, it seems that the next level above the divine arts must be the Ancient Primal Techniques!</p><p></p><p>When his cultivation reaches the divine realm, he should be able to refine the divine arts into the Ancient Primal Techniques.</p><p></p><p>"Why are you asking about this?"</p><p></p><p>"Oh, I'm just curious, that's all."</p><p></p><p>"You're thinking too much. For us ordinary people, having even a one-star divine art is already remarkable, enough for us to go far. As for the Ancient Primal Techniques, below the Divine King realm, it's almost impossible for anyone to even see them, let alone obtain them.</p><p></p><p>They are cultivation techniques that transcend the divine realm! It's not something that we, who haven't even reached the divine realm, need to worry about."</p><p></p><p>Leaf Xiao nodded, then asked again:</p><p></p><p>"By the way, I heard about a cultivation technique called the Great Ascension Divine Body. Does Teacher Zhang know anything about it? What level of technique is that?"</p>

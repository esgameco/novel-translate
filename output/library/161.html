        <h1>Chapter 161</h1>
        <div class="content">
            <p>Here is the full English translation of the Chinese excerpt:</p><p></p><p>Hearing the master's words, Qiufeng's gaze carried a hint of fiery battle intent.</p><p></p><p>It is said that throughout history, right and wrong, success and failure all turn to emptiness, but who doesn't want to become the most dazzling peak?</p><p></p><p>Whether you are a forgemaster or a martial artist, in the end, there must be a winner and a loser.</p><p></p><p>If you lose your opponent, lose the win or lose, and lose the comparison, it would be difficult for life to have any meaning.</p><p></p><p>At least, the vast majority of people are like this.</p><p></p><p>"To ensure your victory, I have specially selected three materials for you.</p><p></p><p>This is the material I have carefully selected after years of research and careful consideration of the competition rules. It will not cause you to lose points for using your own materials, and it can also improve the quality of your forging."</p><p></p><p>Qiufeng's expression had a hint of refusal.</p><p></p><p>"Teacher, I..."</p><p></p><p>The professor waved his hand and said with a faint smile, "Do you think I, Chen Dayuan, can't handle it? Do some little tricks?"</p><p></p><p>Qiufeng didn't say anything, and Chen Dayuan continued, "Child, in this world, there is no absolute justice. The first place can only be won by one person, and if you don't get it, someone else will. The gap between the first place and the second place is something you can never imagine.</p><p></p><p>Like me, before I won the first place, it was as difficult as climbing to the sky to even be promoted to an associate professor. After I won the first place, I directly became a full professor of the academy.</p><p></p><p>The difference in both living conditions and teaching resources is heaven and earth.</p><p></p><p>Furthermore, you don't really think that Zhang Guangyang's disciple won't bring materials to the competition, do you?</p><p></p><p>Who isn't racking their brains and fighting for that first place? Not just them and us, but the third, fourth, and fifth places... I tell you, as long as they have the conditions, they will all bring in a certain amount of materials."</p><p></p><p>"I see, then I understand."</p><p></p><p>Seeing that his disciple understood, Chen Dayuan nodded in satisfaction.</p><p></p><p>Time passed quickly, and the next day arrived. When Ye Xiao woke up from his meditation in the morning, the Earth Escape Technique had already been cultivated to the Great Perfection realm.</p><p></p><p>It could be used now.</p><p></p><p>Ye Xiao immediately activated the Earth Escape Technique and directly burrowed into the ground.</p><p></p><p>The surrounding light was pitch black, but the Earth Escape Technique had a certain perception ability, allowing him to sense the changes in the surrounding environment.</p><p></p><p>For example, whether there were any cesspits ahead.</p><p></p><p>At the same time, Ye Xiao also tested the speed of the Earth Escape Technique, and it was indeed slower than the Divine Will Technique.</p><p></p><p>However, this does not mean that the Earth Escape Technique is completely useless.</p><p></p><p>When the Divine Will Technique encounters danger, it can only flee, while the Earth Escape Technique can burrow underground to save one's life when in danger.</p><p></p><p>Each has its own advantages.</p><p></p><p>Moreover, Ye Xiao thought of a combo, using the Earth Escape Technique in combination with the Divine Will Technique, switching back and forth, to achieve unexpected combos in battle.</p><p></p><p>A truly perfect technique! Absolutely awesome.</p><p></p><p>At this time, the competition time was also about to begin. With a thought, Ye Xiao immediately activated the Earth Escape Technique and headed towards the competition arena.</p><p></p><p>However, when he arrived under the Hu City River, he inadvertently entered a seal by chance.</p><p></p><p>"Where is this?"</p><p></p><p>Ye Xiao was somewhat perplexed, and soon after, a sinister voice sounded in his ears.</p><p></p><p>"Hiss hiss hiss, who would have thought that a little human brat would actually enter the seal. I haven't tasted human flesh for a long time, looks like I'll be feasting today. Hiss hiss hiss."</p><p></p><p>Hearing this voice and using the Taixuan Heavenly Might to scan the area, Ye Xiao immediately understood the situation.</p><p></p><p>Just like how the Jianghai City area would seal powerful star beasts as the formation's core to help the city absorb spiritual energy, Hu City, as the top-tier martial arts city in the Nine Realms, must have sealed even more star beasts.</p><p></p><p>Therefore, he inadvertently wandered into one of these seals, and the one sealed here was a Primal Seventh-Grade Mysterious Earth Python.</p><p></p><p>Ye Xiao had seen the Mysterious Earth Python in the Star Beast Encyclopedia before. Its flesh was delicious, its blood essence was rich, and its spiritual energy was abundant.</p><p></p><p>It was an extremely good and nourishing supplement.</p><p></p><p>At this moment, the Mysterious Earth Python could no longer wait and began to attack.</p><p></p><p>It opened its bloody maw, and due to its massive size, the violent 'hissing' sound as it inhaled could almost suck in the surrounding air into a huge black hole.</p><p></p><p>"Feel the suffocation of death, human!"</p><p></p><p>The Mysterious Earth Python left, but not in a peaceful manner.</p><p></p><p>Because it was too big.</p><p></p><p>Ye Xiao's spatial storage ring could not completely contain it.</p><p></p><p>His spatial storage ring was only equivalent to the size of two three-story villas, while the Mysterious Earth Python's entire body had already exceeded the size of a one-and-a-half-story villa, not to mention the other star beast corpses and materials inside the villa-sized space.</p><p></p><p>So Ye Xiao could only cut it into sections and store as much as he could.</p><p></p><p>What made the Mysterious Earth Python feel even more desperate and agonizing was that Ye Xiao also sealed its soul on one of the sections.</p><p></p><p>Because Ye Xiao planned to revive it later to raise it, and without a soul, the Healing Technique would not be able to achieve this.</p><p></p><p>This meant that its future fate would not be a good one.</p><p></p><p>Soon, Ye Xiao arrived at the competition arena. At this time, the forgemasters participating in the competition had already entered one by one.</p><p></p><p>Here is the full English translation of the Chinese excerpt:</p><p></p><p>Ye Xiao passed through the crowd, and without using the Taixuan Tiangong, he could still hear the people discussing the several seeded players in this competition.</p><p></p><p>The Shu City Martial Arts Academy, the proud disciple of Professor Zhang Guangyang, the master of forging, the genius forging prodigy Yu Qiuxuan.</p><p></p><p>The Jingzhou Martial Arts Academy, the proud disciple of Professor Chen Danian, the master of forging, Song Qiufeng.</p><p></p><p>The Shangqing Martial Arts Academy, the proud disciple of Professor Wang Chunyu, the master of forging, Bai Yishui.</p><p></p><p>Basically, they were all the proud disciples of the forging masters from several top-tier martial arts academies in the country, each from a renowned school.</p><p></p><p>People like them were basically predestined to be among the top finishers in the competition.</p><p></p><p>It couldn't be helped, they had the best educational resources, and they were among the top experts in the country. Furthermore, they had a bit of natural talent, so they could easily forge excellent items.</p><p></p><p>As for the others, they were inferior in terms of teaching quality, practice resources, and even natural talent.</p><p></p><p>Before they could even get started, they were already far behind the others.</p><p></p><p>There's a saying that goes, "For some people, their starting point is already others' endpoint."</p><p></p><p>But Ye Xiao was not interested in these people, nor did he have much interest in the first place.</p><p></p><p>The only thing he was interested in was the reward for fifth place in the competition - the spatial amethyst.</p><p></p><p>Soon, he entered the competition arena and found his position.</p><p></p><p>All the forgers were separated to prevent some people from being psychologically unbalanced and affecting the performance of others.</p><p></p><p>The competition materials had already been prepared, and there would be cameras monitoring the entire process.</p><p></p><p>But these cameras were completely useless to Ye Xiao.</p><p></p><p>To forge, he would inevitably use spiritual energy, even if just a tiny bit, for he was a powerful cultivator of the Divine Sect.</p><p></p><p>In such a situation, the magnetic field around him would be enough to render the monitoring cameras ineffective.</p><p></p><p>The competition began, and Ye Xiao glanced at the materials. In an instant, he had a plan in mind and decisively began the forging process.</p><p></p><p>At the same time, the commentator on the high platform started communicating with the judges, evaluating the forgers displayed on the big screen one by one.</p><p></p><p>After all, this was a major event, so they had to do a live broadcast and generate some revenue.</p><p></p><p>The host, a man and a woman, fit the standard fixed model of the Nine Provinces.</p><p></p><p>Male and female paired up, making the work less tiring.</p><p></p><p>"Okay, audience friends in the venue and in front of the television, what you are now seeing is the live broadcast of the 103rd Forging Competition, the Nine Provinces tournament."</p><p></p><p>The host babbled on with a bunch of nonsense before finally getting to the main topic.</p><p></p><p>"It is said that this competition has many seeded players.</p><p></p><p>Like the genius forging prodigy Yu Qiuxuan from the Shu City Martial Arts Academy.</p><p></p><p>The forging genius Song Qiufeng from the Jingzhou Martial Arts Academy.</p><p></p><p>They are all from renowned schools, and their natural talents are exceptional. They have won many awards in international junior competitions."</p><p></p><p>The backstage crew controlling the big screen was also very skilled. As the host mentioned the few geniuses, they immediately switched the screen to display their images.</p><p></p><p>The audience was instantly drawn in.</p><p></p><p>"Wow, no wonder they are from renowned schools, these young people are so powerful."</p><p></p><p>As the saying goes, "When an expert makes a move, you can tell if they have it or not."</p><p></p><p>The audience watching the competition was mainly composed of forgers, so many people could immediately feel the high level of forging skills on display.</p><p></p><p>"That Yu Qiuxuan, her techniques are indeed exquisite. Look at the speed of her purification, it's only been one minute, and she's already purified one-fifth of the materials. Probably she'll finish the purification in five minutes."</p><p></p><p>"That's insane, for others, purification might take an hour, but she can do it in five minutes. When it comes to the forging part, the time required will likely not be long either."</p><p></p><p>"Time is a crucial factor in the scoring, and her speed is so fast, she'll probably get a lot of extra points."</p><p></p><p>"That Song Qiufeng is also not bad, just a little slower than Yu Qiuxuan, but the purity of what he refines seems to be even more refined than Yu Qiuxuan's. In that case, his forging speed might surpass Yu Qiuxuan's. The two of them canceling each other out, it's hard to say who will win."</p><p></p><p>"Wow, they are truly disciples of renowned masters. Their teachers are the top forgers in the Nine Provinces, so their performance is naturally not going to be lacking.</p><p></p><p>I estimate they'll be able to complete the competition in just one hour."</p><p></p><p>"It seems the top places in this competition will fall into their hands."</p><p></p><p>The eyes of the crowd were filled with envy. They were all so young, yet they had such profound mastery in the art of forging. Their future was limitless, and they had practically already secured a successful life.</p><p></p><p>In the judge's seats, Chen Danian glanced at his old rival Zhang Guangyang, the corners of his mouth slightly upturned.</p><p></p><p>For this competition, he had passed on his secret forging techniques to his disciple.</p><p></p><p>When it came to the forging stage, Song Qiufeng's true abilities would be revealed.</p><p></p><p>That would be the real climax of the competition! People would be shocked to witness his disciple Song Qiufeng surpass Zhang Guangyang's disciple Yu Qiuxuan and become the champion of this Nine Provinces tournament!</p><p></p><p>But just as everyone thought the competition result was already determined, the next moment, a forging station on the competition field suddenly pressed the finish button, and a deep, loud sound suddenly made the entire venue tremble.</p>

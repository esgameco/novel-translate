        <h1>Chapter 266</h1>
        <div class="content">
            <p>Here is the full English translation of the Chinese excerpt:</p><p></p><p>The Eternal Life Technique was activated, and Ye Xiao's arm instantly recovered, as good as new.</p><p></p><p>The severed arm that had fallen to the ground turned back into blood energy and merged back into Ye Xiao's body, replenishing the lost blood energy.</p><p></p><p>"This healing technique is so powerful, it can instantly restore my injuries to their original state. </p><p></p><p>I am already a King Realm expert, with extremely strong blood energy. Once injured, it's usually very difficult to fully recover, even using three Emperor Realm techniques, it would take some time to perfectly heal my body.</p><p></p><p>But this technique was able to completely restore me in an instant. It's truly a remarkable technique! No wonder it's called the Healing Divine Art.</p><p></p><p>With this technique, even if I'm injured in future battles, I can instantly heal myself. </p><p></p><p>As long as my opponent is not overwhelmingly powerful, capable of instantly annihilating me, they won't be able to kill me."</p><p></p><p>Obtaining this powerful healing technique greatly improved Ye Xiao's mood.</p><p></p><p>He now possessed the Godslayer Sword Technique at the Emperor Realm level, and the Eternal Life Technique, a Healing Divine Art.</p><p></p><p>Next, he chose to focus on cultivating movement techniques.</p><p></p><p>He could have chosen to cultivate a martial art technique instead.</p><p></p><p>But martial arts were not as important at the moment.</p><p></p><p>As always, combat, healing, movement, defense, and mental cultivation techniques were all essential.</p><p></p><p>He would focus on these five aspects first.</p><p></p><p>As for defense, he currently only had the Indestructible Divine Skill for body refinement and the Undying Technique for soul refinement.</p><p></p><p>He didn't know what other technique he needed to synthesize.</p><p></p><p>So for now, he would focus on synthesizing a movement technique.</p><p></p><p>Movement techniques were extremely important. </p><p></p><p>They were essential for chasing, fleeing, and traveling.</p><p></p><p>Since he already had the sword technique as a reliable attack method, whether he had an additional martial art technique or not didn't matter much.</p><p></p><p>Thus, Ye Xiao selected the Divine Will Technique, Earth Escape, and Untraceable Wind as the three Emperor Realm movement techniques to synthesize.</p><p></p><p>Over the next few days, Ye Xiao continued reading as usual. </p><p></p><p>In addition to studying some basic eye techniques to imprint eye techniques and synthesize an Emperor Realm eye technique, he was also constantly reviewing books related to mental cultivation techniques.</p><p></p><p>He currently had the Purple Cosmos Sea and the Dharma Sutra as his mental cultivation techniques.</p><p></p><p>If he could obtain another mental cultivation technique, he could synthesize a Divine Realm mental cultivation technique, which would completely solve his future battle consumption issues.</p><p></p><p>Divine Realm techniques consumed an astronomical amount of spiritual energy, and even two Emperor Realm mental cultivation techniques might not be enough when cultivating Divine Realm techniques.</p><p></p><p>After about seven days, Ye Xiao was finally able to refine and derive a new Emperor Realm mental cultivation technique from over 2,000 Patriarch Realm mental cultivation techniques - the Ocean Encompassing All Rivers.</p><p></p><p>This mental cultivation technique was fundamentally different from the Dharma Sutra and the Purple Cosmos Sea, and could be used to synthesize new techniques.</p><p></p><p>Mental cultivation techniques had an immense impact on cultivation, so Ye Xiao could imagine that after synthesizing this new technique, combined with the abundant spiritual energy in the Jianghai City and the nourishment from the star beast meat, his cultivation speed would increase significantly.</p><p></p><p>If he could also obtain some dragon qi, there was hope that he could completely break through to the Emperor Realm in a year.</p><p></p><p>But for now, Ye Xiao didn't know where to find dragon veins.</p><p></p><p>He could only wait patiently for the right opportunity.</p><p></p><p>However, that morning when Ye Xiao just arrived at the library, he heard a shocking news.</p><p></p><p>A small state in the West had disappeared overnight!</p><p></p><p>Although it was just a small state, it was still a state, not a small city or town, but a combination of multiple cities.</p><p></p><p>Yet it had vanished without a trace, known to almost no one.</p><p></p><p>This event had caused a huge uproar online. Although the Nine States tried to suppress the news, it was impossible to contain it on the external internet, let alone within the Nine States themselves.</p><p></p><p>Many people had gone abroad from the Nine States in recent years, and just a few of them making phone calls could spread the news widely.</p><p></p><p>In the end, the Nine States had no choice but to report some news about the incident.</p><p></p><p>This event had almost the biggest impact on netizens recently, far exceeding even the appearance of the Sword and Saber Immortal in Jianghai City.</p><p></p><p>After all, the Sword and Immortal Saber's fame was only for defeating the 49th and 50th ranked Divine Realm experts on the World Dragon Ranking, while the rest of his deeds were largely unknown.</p><p></p><p>"Have you heard? The place that was destroyed is called Lizhou, a tiny state in the West. It's so tragic, the entire state disappeared overnight, leaving behind only a flat expanse of land, without a single person or building remaining."</p><p></p><p>"Ah, these days are getting harder and harder. The Demon Calamity hasn't even arrived yet, and now this has happened. I don't know what's going on anymore."</p><p></p><p>"I heard from my relative working in the West that the place had the aura of a powerful star beast, so it was likely destroyed by an extremely powerful star beast, possibly one that grew stronger after the Seven Stars Convergence, and is now starting to confront the human race."</p><p></p><p>"I've heard that this time, the Seven Stars Convergence has..."</p><p></p><p>Here is the full English translation of the Chinese excerpt:</p><p></p><p>The stars were connected, even more powerful than all the previous seven-star connections. No one knew if the beast disaster this time would also become stronger.</p><p></p><p>The crowd was discussing animatedly, each person speaking eloquently. Ye Xiao never got involved in such matters.</p><p></p><p>There was an analysis online that the less people earned, the more they liked to worry about national affairs and care about environmental issues and other things unrelated to their own lives. </p><p></p><p>It seemed the bigger the issues they discussed, the more they could showcase their capabilities.</p><p></p><p>Thinking carefully, this matter must be handled by Saint Realm experts or even King Realm experts. What was there to worry about? But what Ye Xiao didn't expect was that Liu Chengxun also had a grave expression.</p><p></p><p>"Ye Xiao, I'm afraid a major disaster is about to happen this time."</p><p></p><p>Ye Xiao: "(_..)!"</p><p></p><p>Well, it seems this rule is not very accurate.</p><p></p><p>"Why are you also frowning? If it's just about destroying a small state, you should be able to do it too, right?"</p><p></p><p>Liu Chengxun shook his head.</p><p></p><p>"I'm not talking about that. The Lishi State is just a small state, its martial arts strength is not strong, so it's not surprising that it was destroyed. But the destruction of Lishi State is just the surface, the deeper reason is that Lishi State had a dragon vein, which was taken away."</p><p></p><p>Ye Xiao's heart suddenly sank.</p><p></p><p>"You know about dragon veins, right? You read books every day, so you should understand some of it?"</p><p></p><p>Ye Xiao nodded.</p><p></p><p>"That's right, I do understand some of it. But a dragon vein should just be a concentration of spiritual energy, a natural phenomenon, right? Even if it's stolen, is there a need to be so dramatic?</p><p></p><p>Moreover, Lishi State is originally a very small place, even if it has a dragon vein, it can't be a very large one, right?"</p><p></p><p>Liu Chengxun shook his head.</p><p></p><p>"You don't know, a dragon vein is not like other resources. It is said that there is a fortuitous encounter within a dragon vein that can allow a human realm expert to break through the King Realm shackles and advance to higher martial arts cultivation.</p><p></p><p>If a human takes this dragon vein, he may be doing it to break through to a higher realm. </p><p></p><p>But if it's the Star Beasts who took it, then the problem is huge.</p><p></p><p>The Star Beasts cannot use the dragon vein to break through to higher realms, but they can use the dragon vein to do some special things, such as temporarily enhancing their own strength and gaining greater power.</p><p></p><p>Or, they could use it to detonate it. Dragon veins contain a large amount of natural spiritual energy. If the Star Beasts place it somewhere and detonate it, it would be a disaster of apocalyptic proportions for the human realm in that area."</p><p></p><p>Ye Xiao fell silent. He knew this matter was out of the ordinary, but he hadn't thought about it in this direction.</p><p></p><p>If what Liu Chengxun said was true, then he would have to be on guard. Who knows what these Star Beasts wanted to do? If their goal was to destroy the human realm, what if they came to Jianghai City? But thinking carefully, it shouldn't be that serious. If the other side really wanted to deal with the Nine States, they should have come to the Nine States, why bother going to the West to plunder the dragon vein? The West also has many experts, if they go to the West to cause trouble, they will surely provoke those experts.</p><p></p><p>Moreover, even if they come to the Nine States, the Nine States also have many experts. </p><p></p><p>The Nine States cannot not survive without him, and he is not a bodhisattva who goes around saving the world.</p><p></p><p>The priority should be to focus on improving his own cultivation.</p><p></p><p>However, what Ye Xiao didn't expect was that just as he was getting off work, he unexpectedly encountered an old acquaintance at the entrance of the library.</p><p></p><p>Beitang Ce! "Senior Beitang, why did you suddenly come to Jianghai City?"</p><p></p><p>Beitang Ce smiled faintly:</p><p></p><p>"I'm here in the vicinity on some business, and I happened to come by to see you. What, does Mr. Ye not welcome this old man?"</p><p></p><p>Ye Xiao shook his head.</p><p></p><p>"Not at all, I've been under your care in the Central State for a while. Since you're in Jianghai City today, let me treat you to a few drinks as a gesture of my gratitude."</p><p></p><p>"Then I won't decline the old man's hospitality."</p><p></p><p>Beitang Ce handed Ye Xiao a small storage ring.</p><p></p><p>"I suddenly came without bringing any good gifts. Inside are three pre-Heaven seventh-grade Star Beasts that I just slew. Consider this my gift to you."</p><p></p><p>Ye Xiao didn't make too many courtesies, directly taking it and putting it in his pocket.</p><p></p><p>"Senior Beitang has been too kind. Let's go, let's go to my place for a chat."</p><p></p><p>"Okay!"</p><p></p><p>The two of them used their movement techniques, and in a moment, they arrived at Ye Xiao's home.</p><p></p><p>Seeing this suburban little house, a look of surprise flashed across Beitang Ce's eyes. It seemed he didn't expect that with Ye Xiao's identity, he would actually live in such a place? Not only was the location remote, but the house was also very dilapidated, completely inconsistent with the image of a powerful expert like Ye Xiao! This made him admire Ye Xiao even more.</p><p></p><p>This is a true genius! Not constrained by trivialities, hiding his light under a bushel - no wonder he could become so strong in such a short time, breaking through to the Half-Step King Realm.</p><p></p><p>Huanliuli sensed Ye Xiao's aura and immediately came to open the door.</p><p></p><p>"Master, you're back."</p><p></p><p>[End of second update, 6,000 words.</p><p></p><p>Seeking recommendations, monthly votes, and subscriptions.</p><p></p><p>I've been updating continuously these past few days, and my body is a bit unwell, so I've been struggling the past couple of days.]</p><p></p><p>(End of chapter)</p>

        <h1>Chapter 294</h1>
        <div class="content">
            <p>Here is the full English translation of the Chinese excerpt:</p><p></p><p>"Grandmother, why did you suddenly summon us here?" </p><p></p><p>The Vixen Queen's face was grave as she said, "Trouble has occurred. The secret of the Imperial Realm inheritance may have been discovered by someone else."</p><p></p><p>As soon as she finished speaking, Ning Yuhen and Ye Xiao's faces both tensed up.</p><p></p><p>"How could this happen? Who leaked the information?"</p><p></p><p>The Vixen Queen sighed deeply.</p><p></p><p>"It was those few of them. I don't know how they found out, but the secret has been exposed. </p><p></p><p>This morning when I went to find them, they flew away without a word, and I didn't even have time to intercept them.</p><p></p><p>If I'm guessing correctly, they will soon bring other powerful experts here."</p><p></p><p>"What? What are we going to do?" </p><p></p><p>Ning Yuhen was somewhat anxious, while Ye Xiao was slightly taken aback. He seemed to understand why those spirit beasts had fled.</p><p></p><p>Likely, it was because they were terrified after Ye Xiao had slain Liangluo Yuzhu and Hesenzi. That must have been a misunderstanding.</p><p></p><p>Just as Ye Xiao was about to open his mouth to try and ease their tension, the Vixen Queen spoke up again with a grave expression:</p><p></p><p>"The only solution now is to utilize the secret techniques of my Silver Fox Clan to forcibly activate the Imperial Realm ruins, so that you two can enter the ruins ahead of time and retrieve the inheritance.</p><p></p><p>That way, even if we encounter some trouble, as long as the inheritance is not lost, we don't need to worry."</p><p></p><p>Hearing this, the words of comfort that Ye Xiao had been about to say got stuck in his throat.</p><p></p><p>Ning Yuhen exclaimed excitedly:</p><p></p><p>"Grandmother, if you have a way to forcibly activate the Imperial Realm ruins, why didn't you do it earlier?"</p><p></p><p>The Vixen Queen smiled wryly.</p><p></p><p>"That is an Imperial Realm ruin after all, it's not as easy as just saying we'll activate it. Do you think your grandmother is an Imperial Realm expert?</p><p></p><p>Previously, the time for it to fully manifest was still far away, so activating it was difficult. Now, it's almost completely manifested, so the activation should be much more effective.</p><p></p><p>And at first, I didn't even know we had a technique to activate it. It's only been these past few days that I learned from the inheritance passed down in the Silver Fox Clan that we have an ancestral formation technique specifically for activating this Imperial Realm ruin."</p><p></p><p>"I see."</p><p></p><p>The Vixen Queen's expression turned serious as she said:</p><p></p><p>"Time is of the essence now. I will summon the Clan Patriarchs of the Silver Fox Clan to join hands and begin the formation, accelerating the manifestation of the Imperial Realm ruin.</p><p></p><p>Once the ruin is manifested, you two will immediately use your blood to open the entrance and enter it."</p><p></p><p>"Alright!"</p><p></p><p>They quickly arrived at the location of the Imperial Realm ruin.</p><p></p><p>Ye Xiao's spiritual sense had not detected this place before, perhaps because it was a true Imperial Realm expert's ruin.</p><p></p><p>Now, he was seeing this Imperial Realm ruin for the first time.</p><p></p><p>Overall, it was constructed entirely of bronze, shaped somewhat like an ancient cauldron, covered in formations, all of which were Imperial Formations, and emanating an Imperial Aura that was difficult to suppress, even with Ye Xiao's Yin-Yang Escape Art.</p><p></p><p>Although the Yin-Yang Escape Art was a divine movement technique, the key was still the level of the practitioner. </p><p></p><p>If the practitioner's level was strong enough, even an ordinary technique could unleash earth-shattering power. But if the practitioner's level was not high enough, even the best techniques could not be used to their full potential.</p><p></p><p>Ye Xiao was not yet an Imperial Realm expert, while the former King Zhou had once been a veteran Imperial Realm expert.</p><p></p><p>Even with the Yin-Yang Escape Art empowering him, Ye Xiao could only surpass his level to a certain extent, not to the extreme.</p><p></p><p>After briefly instructing the group, the Vixen Queen immediately led the Clan Patriarchs of the Silver Fox Clan to begin deploying the formation.</p><p></p><p>They transformed into their massive fox spirit beast bodies, each the size of a small mountain, containing terrifying power that would make even peers from the human race tremble in awe.</p><p></p><p>The fox elders took the formation of the Nine Dragon Cauldron, unleashing their power to activate the formation.</p><p></p><p>As the formation was activated, the spiritual energy of heaven and earth began to converge towards it.</p><p></p><p>Under the formation's enhancement, the partially manifested Imperial Realm ruin also began to accelerate its manifestation.</p><p></p><p>Howling winds, and faintly visible were several purple dragons swimming on top of the giant cauldron, as if they were pulling it out from another dimension.</p><p></p><p>The so-called Imperial Realm had reached the point where it could place its inheritance in a separate dimension from the current world - a terrifying ability that was a hallmark of the Imperial Realm.</p><p></p><p>The Imperial Realm was the ultimate pinnacle of all powers in the human race.</p><p></p><p>Rumble... At this moment, a thundercloud suddenly formed in the sky above, as if the heavens themselves were wary of the appearance of this ruin.</p><p></p><p>All the Silver Fox Clan members were extremely tense, their hearts pounding in their throats.</p><p></p><p>Here is the full English translation of the Chinese excerpt:</p><p></p><p>The so-called Heavenly Might is not easily defied. Facing the Heavenly Might, any living being can only hold an attitude of reverence and dare not have too much anger.</p><p></p><p>At this time, the formation had already progressed halfway, and that relic was about to be fully manifested.</p><p></p><p>But just at this moment, the thunder and lightning in the sky finally came crashing down.</p><p></p><p>Boom! After a thunderous roar, lightning as thick as a water bucket struck the bodies of the group of Silver Fox Elders.</p><p></p><p>Almost at the same time, the imperial relic site that was originally accelerating its manifestation suddenly paused. It was obvious that this lightning had already affected the Silver Fox Elders, causing their formation to be unable to continue smoothly.</p><p></p><p>And this was not the end, but only the beginning.</p><p></p><p>One bolt of lightning after another came crashing down furiously.</p><p></p><p>The formation of the Silver Fox Elders was completely suppressed and could no longer be catalyzed.</p><p></p><p>"Grandma!" </p><p></p><p>Ning Yuthen's heart tightened, clenching his fists, his gaze filled with the utmost concern.</p><p></p><p>"I can't let this lightning continue to attack them, otherwise, before the catalyzation of the formation is completed, they will already be struck into serious injury."</p><p></p><p>However, just as Ning Yuthen was about to rush forward, a large hand suddenly pressed down on his shoulder.</p><p></p><p>"Manager?"</p><p></p><p>Ning Yuthen turned back and looked at Ye Xiao, puzzled.</p><p></p><p>"That lightning is not something you can withstand."</p><p></p><p>"But I can't just watch as my grandmother is seriously injured for me, and ultimately someone has to go up and bear it."</p><p></p><p>"I'll go!"</p><p></p><p>"No, Manager, your cultivation should only be at the Divine Ancestor Realm, and you won't be able to withstand it either. Although I'm also at the Divine Ancestor Realm, I've already fully refined the Star Beast Body, so I can still resist it."</p><p></p><p>As Ning Yuthen was speaking, his words suddenly came to an abrupt halt.</p><p></p><p>Subsequently, he looked at the Ye Xiao in front of him with disbelief, as if he had seen a ghost.</p><p></p><p>Because he could clearly feel that Ye Xiao's aura was frantically rising, and the speed of the rise was so fast that it was frightening.</p><p></p><p>In the blink of an eye, it had surpassed the Divine Ancestor Realm and was still continuously rising.</p><p></p><p>Primordial Seventh Grade, Primordial Eighth Grade, Primordial Ninth Grade, King Realm! Finally, Ye Xiao's aura had become so powerful that Ning Yuthen couldn't even tell how strong he was.</p><p></p><p>"Manager, you, you, you..."</p><p></p><p>Ning Yuthen simply couldn't believe what he was seeing.</p><p></p><p>The manager was actually a super powerful expert above the King Realm! He had always thought that he was only at the Divine Ancestor Realm before.</p><p></p><p>How laughable, he thought he had already reached the Divine Ancestor Realm and could protect the manager. </p><p></p><p>Now it seems, he's not even qualified to carry the manager's shoes!</p><p></p><p>Indeed, the manager is truly the manager, he has always been the little brother following behind the manager.</p><p></p><p>Ye Xiao smiled faintly.</p><p></p><p>"What, don't recognize me anymore?"</p><p></p><p>"It's just that it's too unbelievable. You actually are such a powerful super expert! I can't even describe the feelings in my heart right now. Are you really the manager I know?"</p><p></p><p>Ye Xiao nodded.</p><p></p><p>"I've always been."</p><p></p><p>With that, he moved his mind, his body instantly appearing above the Silver Fox Elders, and the pressure on the Silver Fox Clan Elders suddenly disappeared. The formation continued to operate, and that imperial relic finally began to fully manifest.</p><p></p><p>As for Ye Xiao, he raised his hand and made a fist.</p><p></p><p>The Fist of Spatial Rupture was activated, and a huge fist print suddenly shot up into the sky, and it kept expanding as it rose.</p><p></p><p>When it reached the sky above, it had already covered all the thunderclouds.</p><p></p><p>Boom! Finally, the fist light and the thunderclouds collided, and in just an instant, the thunderclouds were instantly shattered!</p><p></p><p>One punch! Just one punch directly shattered what had been troubling the entire Silver Fox Clan's experts.</p><p></p><p>How powerful must this technique be?</p><p></p><p>As the sunlight in the sky shone down again, bathing Ye Xiao's body, he was portrayed as a divine being descending.</p><p></p><p>At this moment, the entire Silver Fox Clan, all the clan members, felt as if they were looking at a divine being.</p><p></p><p>The Fox Queen and the others were shocked to the extreme, and even when the imperial relic had fully manifested, they still maintained the formation and did not stop it.</p><p></p><p>This guy, is he really Ye Xiao?</p><p></p><p>They had always regarded him as a Divine Ancestor Realm Ye Xiao before?</p><p></p><p>He is actually an existence above the King Realm, so powerful! Just with this technique, even if he is not at the Emperor Realm, he must be at the peak of the King Realm, a half-step Emperor Realm expert!</p><p></p><p>This seemingly harmless, somewhat handsome and elegant human male, has actually already become a supreme expert who can look down upon their entire Silver Fox Clan?</p><p></p><p>"Manager!"</p><p></p><p>Ning Yuthen clenched his fists, his eyes reddening with emotion.</p><p></p><p>At this moment, he was not only shocked by Ye Xiao's power, but also proud and moved by it, because the manager had just said that he had always been his manager.</p><p></p><p>This will be the pride of his life!</p>

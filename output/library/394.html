        <h1>Chapter 394</h1>
        <div class="content">
            <p>Here is the full English translation of the Chinese excerpt:</p><p></p><p>"Damn it! Retreat quickly!!"</p><p></p><p>The two people quickly fled, and finally, just as the immortality technique in their bodies was about to be exhausted, they managed to escape the poison circle.</p><p></p><p>They looked back at the poison circle, which had now spread to cover an area the size of hundreds of football fields, and couldn't help but exclaim:</p><p></p><p>"He said we would only have about a minute to survive, but in reality, it took us a full two minutes! </p><p></p><p>If I'm not mistaken, what he cast on us must have been a precious technique!"</p><p></p><p>"He is truly a divine person!"</p><p></p><p>The two couldn't help but sigh in awe of the terrifying power of the Sword Immortal.</p><p></p><p>Meanwhile, Ye Xiao had already entered the Poison King's Tomb.</p><p></p><p>Once inside, he discovered that the place was filled with an abundance of toxins, many of which had become so concentrated that they had formed a jet-black, jade-like substance, almost like black charcoal, and were even starting to reflect light.</p><p></p><p>It seemed the powerful Divine Realm cultivator buried here was truly afraid of anyone plundering his tomb.</p><p></p><p>Sweeping his divine sense outward, Ye Xiao was momentarily taken aback by what he sensed next.</p><p></p><p>Unexpectedly, there were still many life forms present here!</p><p></p><p>This was quite surprising.</p><p></p><p>Without paying them any heed, Ye Xiao proceeded deeper into the tomb.</p><p></p><p>As soon as he stepped inside, a pitch-black beam of light erupted, like a bolt of lightning, rushing towards his face with a piercing sound.</p><p></p><p>Boom! Before it could reach Ye Xiao, it was shattered to pieces by his Annihilation Technique.</p><p></p><p>It was a myriad-legged centipede.</p><p></p><p>Originally, it should have been a hundred-legged centipede, but after surviving for so long, it had evolved into a myriad-legged centipede.</p><p></p><p>Its strength had reached the Slay God Realm first level! This was likely because the Divine Realm Tomb was rather closed off, lacking sufficient spiritual energy to support its further evolution.</p><p></p><p>Moreover, the Divine Realm Tomb contained not just this one star beast, but various other star beasts as well, all coexisting and needing to absorb a certain amount of spiritual energy to maintain their survival, even if they could not grow much stronger over the long period of time.</p><p></p><p>However, despite this, their strength was still formidable, at least to those from the outside.</p><p></p><p>If they waited for the poison mist to dissipate and tried to enter, they would likely suffer heavy casualties.</p><p></p><p>What puzzled Ye Xiao, however, was that according to normal logic, even if these toxic creatures were not very active and had extremely long lifespans, they should not have been able to survive all the way from the Ancient Divine Realm era until now. There seemed to be something amiss.</p><p></p><p>He continued moving forward, and another black beam shot towards him.</p><p></p><p>This time, it was a poisonous scorpion.</p><p></p><p>Unfortunately for it, it soon met the same fate as the myriad-legged centipede.</p><p></p><p>After the successive fall of these two black beams, the other star beasts hid in the shadows, not daring to make a single move.</p><p></p><p>Ye Xiao collected the corpses of the centipede and scorpion into his spatial ring. Although he wouldn't eat them, they could still be useful for refining elixirs.</p><p></p><p>As he delved deeper into the tomb, Ye Xiao realized that the resources here had already been largely consumed by these toxic creatures.</p><p></p><p>Apart from some alchemical materials, even the divine crystals had been devoured clean.</p><p></p><p>Perhaps the reason they had been able to survive until now was that they had consumed all the resources within the entire Divine Realm Tomb? Ye Xiao knew that the resources of a Poison King would be far superior to those of a Healing Sage.</p><p></p><p>The number of people who had died at the hands of the Poison King must have been countless.</p><p></p><p>Even if only alchemical materials remained, they would still be far more valuable than the burial goods of the Healing Sage Monarch.</p><p></p><p>It seemed he should capture these creatures and refine them into medicinal pills to make up for the losses from this trip, or else he would end up losing a lot.</p><p></p><p>Ye Xiao collected all the alchemical materials into his spatial ring, feeling that he could now forge hundreds of divine weapons on par with the Great Dragon.</p><p></p><p>He then stepped into the innermost chamber of the tomb.</p><p></p><p>This final chamber housed the tomb of the Poison King Monarch.</p><p></p><p>Although the outer areas were guarded by numerous toxic creatures, the inner chamber itself was relatively clean.</p><p></p><p>Just like the Healing Sage Monarch, this Poison King had a white jade coffin, though Ye Xiao was unsure if this was a common style in the Ancient Divine Realm or a standard issue for Monarchs.</p><p></p><p>The quality of the coffin was excellent, able to preserve a body for tens of thousands of years without decay - a valuable item that would now belong to Ye Xiao.</p><p></p><p>Since his friends could not reach his level of power and longevity, they would likely have a need for such coffins when they eventually passed away, and he could gift them these in the future.</p><p></p><p>Ye Xiao glanced into the white jade coffin, where he saw a clean-looking old man. His attire was neat, just like the female Sage Monarch.</p><p></p><p>There was also a remnant of divine blood within the coffin, which Ye Xiao planned to refine and absorb to further enhance his own cultivation.</p><p></p><p>Here is the full English translation of the Chinese excerpt:</p><p></p><p>He looked around the tomb chamber, and among the items placed here were some powerful cultivation techniques. The markings on the pages showed that these were divine arts, ranging from one-star to nine-star divine arts.</p><p></p><p>The most important thing was that there were also some martial dao experience manuals inside, which was exactly what Ye Xiao needed the most right now.</p><p></p><p>It seemed that in the ancient times, the martial dao culture across the entire starry sky was far more powerful than it is now.</p><p></p><p>Ye Xiao swept up all the cultivation techniques, gaining another harvest.</p><p></p><p>In front of the white jade coffin, there was a small notebook that should have recorded the life story of this divine king.</p><p></p><p>Ye Xiao picked it up and glanced through it. "I was poor in my youth, and out of desperation, I had to break through walls to steal light and research cultivation techniques. Alas, the noisy neighbors working late into the night and the complexity of the techniques meant that I would discuss them until dawn, causing me to neglect my martial studies. </p><p></p><p>By the time I came of age, I had already missed the prime time for cultivation. And due to my dull innate talents, I had no choice but to turn to the path of poison cultivation.</p><p></p><p>After two thousand years of cultivation, I have only just barely succeeded."</p><p></p><p>Ye Xiao: "(¯▽¯)"</p><p></p><p>How annoying, writing in such classical Chinese? He couldn't understand a single bit of it.</p><p></p><p>Fortunately, it didn't mention anything about the divine nation's treasure trove, which put Ye Xiao's mind at ease.</p><p></p><p>It seems not every divine king was so boring.</p><p></p><p>He burned the small notebook, then opened the white jade coffin, ready to absorb the divine blood of this divine king.</p><p></p><p>However, just as he opened the coffin, a golden light suddenly shot out from within, heading straight for his shoulder.</p><p></p><p>Its speed was astonishingly fast, almost reaching Ye Xiao in an instant.</p><p></p><p>The next moment, Ye Xiao felt a sharp, mosquito-like pain in his shoulder.</p><p></p><p>Then half his body started to go numb.</p><p></p><p>Ye Xiao's pupils constricted - such potent toxicity! Even though he had cultivated nine-star divine art level poison techniques and the Poison God's Impenetrable Body, the opponent could still poison his body. One could imagine how powerful the toxicity was.</p><p></p><p>Probably any warrior below the divine king realm would be unable to dodge this attack.</p><p></p><p>However, in the blink of an eye, his Immortal Treasure Art began to activate, instantly purging the toxins and leaving his body unharmed.</p><p></p><p>Ye Xiao turned his head to look, and on his shoulder was a golden three-headed snake, its fangs firmly embedded in his flesh.</p><p></p><p>This snake must be an ancient variant species.</p><p></p><p>Its cultivation was only at the Deicide Realm Second Layer, otherwise it wouldn't have needed to use poison, and could have directly confronted him with brute force.</p><p></p><p>It seemed this old Poison King not only excelled in toxins, but also had crafty and bizarre methods. Even in his own coffin, he had raised this little snake.</p><p></p><p>Even if the outside people managed to get through the poisonous mist and deal with the poison insects, they might still end up dying to this little snake in the end.</p><p></p><p>Seeing the snake biting enthusiastically, Ye Xiao simply slapped it on the head.</p><p></p><p>The little golden snake died, flattened like a mosquito under his palm.</p><p></p><p>Its physique might be a bit stronger, but it was no match for Ye Xiao's ability to transcend realms.</p><p></p><p>Pulling the little snake down, Ye Xiao tossed it into his spatial ring, planning to deal with it later. Such a good thing could be used to make some medicinal wine.</p><p></p><p>Then, he proceeded to completely absorb all the divine blood within the old divine king.</p><p></p><p>The old divine king only had a little over two million drops of divine blood, not as much as the previous healing goddess queen.</p><p></p><p>After all, one was a poison specialist, the other a professional support healer. How could the poison guy's divine blood compare to the healer's?</p><p></p><p>With the meager divine blood, he wouldn't even qualify as a proper support. </p><p></p><p>Afterwards, Ye Xiao gave the old divine king a final blessing, taking the white jade coffin with him. Outside, he captured and looted all the poison insects, leaving none behind, before finally departing the divine king's tomb.</p><p></p><p>Outside the divine king's tomb, in the starry sky, the scions and clan members of the Xuanyuan Clan looked dejected.</p><p></p><p>They had failed to find the divine king's tomb, and had even lost two young masters and several divine realm experts in the process.</p><p></p><p>This trip had been a huge loss for them.</p><p></p><p>But just then, two figures rapidly approached them from the distance.</p><p></p><p>"Apologies, everyone. We're back late."</p><p></p><p>"Young Master!"</p><p>"Young Master!"</p><p></p><p>The divine realm experts from the Ning and Ling families quickly surrounded them.</p><p></p><p>Song Qingxue and the others couldn't help but step forward as well. "Ning Zhiyuan, Ling Shaoyu, how did you two manage to escape?"</p><p></p><p>Ning Zhiyuan responded with a wry smile. "Are you hoping we had died or something?"</p><p></p><p>Song Qingxue coughed lightly.</p><p></p><p>"That's not what I meant. I'm just curious how you two managed to get out."</p><p></p><p>Ning Zhiyuan and Ling Shaoyu exchanged a glance.</p><p></p><p>"You tell them, or should I?"</p><p></p><p>"You go ahead, since you know more about it."</p><p></p><p>Ning Zhiyuan took a deep breath, his expression grave.</p><p></p><p>"We encountered the Sword Immortal! He's the one who saved us!"</p>

        <h1>Chapter 272</h1>
        <div class="content">
            <p>Here is the full English translation of the Chinese excerpt:</p><p></p><p>Ye Xiao nodded, and the next moment, Beitang Ce cupped his hands and said towards the darkness in front of him, "Beitang Ce pays respects to the Venerable White Tiger. Please, Venerable White Tiger, show yourself and grant me the White Tiger Seal."</p><p></p><p>After a moment, a figure slowly emerged from the darkness.</p><p></p><p>She had a beautiful and heroic short hairstyle, exquisite features, and a perfect figure. She wore a sleeveless fur coat on the upper body and a gray skirt with gray leggings on the lower body.</p><p></p><p>If one were to look at her appearance alone, she would be considered a slender and exquisite beauty, with a small face that was pleasing to the eye.</p><p></p><p>But there was one thing that set her apart.</p><p></p><p>One word: big.</p><p></p><p>Two words: very big.</p><p></p><p>Three words: extremely big! She was a woman with a very womanly figure, exuding an aura of conquering desire.</p><p></p><p>She held a bottle of fine spiritual wine, taking a few gulps. With a gaze that was seven parts sharp and three parts alluring, she glanced sideways at Ye Xiao.</p><p></p><p>"You little rascal, you're quite bold, aren't you? In all these years, you are the first one to break through the spiritual barrier so quickly, and the first one to dare to use force to directly break through the spiritual barrier.</p><p></p><p>However, my White Tiger Seal is not so easily obtained.</p><p></p><p>Relying solely on your good looks won't be enough to get my White Tiger Seal."</p><p></p><p>Ye Xiao pondered for a moment, then took out a bottle from his storage ring - a spiritual wine brewed with honey, deer blood, deer velvet, and various other precious ingredients.</p><p></p><p>The White Tiger's mouth curled up slightly.</p><p></p><p>"You're quite smart, knowing to use the thing that I, the Venerable One, am most unable to resist, to tempt me. But unfortunately, although I am addicted to alcohol, I am also extremely demanding when it comes to the wine itself.</p><p></p><p>With just this little bottle, you think you can get the Venerable One to submit? That's a bit too presumptuous, don't you think?"</p><p></p><p>However, as soon as she finished speaking, Ye Xiao uncorked the bottle.</p><p></p><p>The aroma of the wine permeated the air, and the Venerable White Tiger took a deep sniff, then raised two fingers.</p><p></p><p>"Add two more bottles."</p><p></p><p>Ye Xiao took out two more bottles and directly tossed them, along with the previous one, towards the Venerable White Tiger.</p><p></p><p>After receiving the spiritual wine, the Venerable White Tiger tossed the White Tiger Seal to Ye Xiao.</p><p></p><p>Holding the White Tiger Seal, Ye Xiao walked straight towards the Heavenly Gate.</p><p></p><p>The Venerable White Tiger retreated to the side, enjoying the fine wine that Ye Xiao had provided, while Beitang Ce was somewhat amused and bewildered.</p><p></p><p>"Venerable One, didn't you just say that you wouldn't give him the White Tiger Seal just because of his wine?"</p><p></p><p>"I only said one bottle wouldn't work, but he gave me three."</p><p></p><p>Beitang Ce: "Σ(°△°|||)!"</p><p></p><p>The Venerable White Tiger took a sip of the spiritual wine, watching Ye Xiao's retreating figure with great interest.</p><p></p><p>"Moreover, with his talent, there's an 80% chance that he'll be able to pass the Dragon Vein's test. When his strength increases, it will also benefit our Nine Prefectures. How could I not agree?</p><p></p><p>However, passing is one thing, but how he passes and how long it takes are issues he must face.</p><p></p><p>The less time it takes him to pass, the more the Dragon Vein is pleased with him. The longer it takes, the less the Dragon Vein cares for him.</p><p></p><p>This will ultimately affect the benefits the Dragon Vein bestows upon him."</p><p></p><p>Beitang Ce sighed softly, clenching his fists as he watched Ye Xiao's back.</p><p></p><p>"Ye Xiao, you must do your best! It's so rare for our Nine Prefectures to have a genius like you! You must succeed!"</p><p></p><p>Ye Xiao arrived at the Heavenly Gate, placing the Xuanwu Seal and the White Tiger Seal in the recesses on the gate, which corresponded to the Azure Dragon, White Tiger, Vermilion Bird, and Black Tortoise.</p><p></p><p>Only two of the seals were needed to open the Heavenly Gate.</p><p></p><p>As Ye Xiao placed the two seals in the recesses, a deep voice resonated.</p><p></p><p>Creak... It seemed that with the passage of time, the bronze gate's joints had rusted.</p><p></p><p>The gate opened, and a long, ancient stone path was revealed to Ye Xiao's eyes.</p><p></p><p>Thick spiritual energy surged forth, like a tidal wave, and the refreshing sensation caused Ye Xiao's pores to involuntarily relax.</p><p></p><p>"So this is the Heavenly Way?"</p><p></p><p>Ye Xiao looked up, and the path led all the way to the clouds, where at the end, a majestic dragon figure seemed to be overlooking from above.</p><p></p><p>Waves of dragon aura were being released from its body, attempting to completely subdue Ye Xiao.</p><p></p><p>Ye Xiao's gaze remained calm and unperturbed. Though he was but an insignificant ant, he faced the heavens without the slightest retreat.</p><p></p><p>By now, many martial arts experts had gathered below, but out of respect for the Venerable White Tiger's presence, they dared not act rashly, and could only observe from a distance.</p><p></p><p>"Look, the Heavenly Gate has been opened. That person is about to ascend the Heavenly Stairs."</p><p></p><p>"I wonder how he'll perform? Can he break the records that have shocked the Nine Prefectures before?"</p><p></p><p>"Ah, throughout the ages, how many geniuses with exceptional talents have appeared in our Nine Prefectures? Every one of them who came to the Long White Dragon Vein was a Monarch Realm expert. They were all prodigies of astounding brilliance.</p><p></p><p>But in the end, didn't they all still fail in the challenge? To be able to reach the summit is already extremely remarkable. If he wants to compete for the top spots, challenging those rare and exceptional talents from the past, he'll probably just end up disappointed."</p><p></p><p>There were various opinions - some filled with anticipation, others with lament, some with speculation, and some with rational understanding.</p><p></p><p>After all, the Long White Dragon Vein was one of the most renowned dragon veins in the Nine Prefectures.</p><p></p><p>Here is the full English translation of the Chinese excerpt:</p><p></p><p>Since ancient times, those who have come here to challenge the dragon vein have all been renowned existences across the Nine Realms.</p><p></p><p>Which of them has not shaken the past and present?</p><p></p><p>Yet, no one knows what kind of person this Ye Xiao is today.</p><p></p><p>So, no one dares to make a complete guess.</p><p></p><p>Finally!</p><p></p><p>In the eyes of all, Ye Xiao took the first step.</p><p></p><p>The light and firm footsteps came, as if heavily striking the hearts of the crowd.</p><p></p><p>It has begun!</p><p></p><p>At this moment, the voices of the people seemed to have been unified, and they all fell silent.</p><p></p><p>All eyes were fixed on that silhouette, watching how he would conquer this stairway that only the most extraordinary talents could conquer.</p><p></p><p>For Ye Xiao, before stepping onto the stairway, he could only feel the thick spiritual energy like the waves in the vast sea.</p><p></p><p>But after stepping onto the stairway, Ye Xiao could feel the pressure from the dragon vein.</p><p></p><p>Extremely heavy! As heavy as Mount Tai!</p><p></p><p>Moreover, with each step he took upward, the pressure suddenly increased.</p><p></p><p>Ye Xiao knew that this was a dragon vein that had been condensed for countless years, perhaps thousands or even tens of thousands of years, or even since ancient times.</p><p></p><p>The spiritual energy it contained was far beyond his imagination.</p><p></p><p>From now on, it would be a test of his own willpower.</p><p></p><p>However, what he didn't expect was that at this moment, the Golden Book Spiritual Soul within him suddenly burst forth with a golden warm flow, enveloping him.</p><p></p><p>In an instant, the pressure of the dragon's might disappeared without a trace.</p><p></p><p>Ye Xiao was stunned, feeling as if he heard a dragon's roar in his ears. This dragon's roar was not oppressive, not confrontational, but gentle and peaceful, as if it had completely recognized Ye Xiao.</p><p></p><p>Ye Xiao's mouth curved slightly upward, although he didn't know what was going on?</p><p></p><p>But the dragon vein should have recognized the Golden Book Spiritual Soul, so it withdrew the pressure on him.</p><p></p><p>However, this was a good thing, at least he didn't have to struggle against it.</p><p></p><p>Golden Book Spiritual Soul, how many more surprises do you have for me? Ye Xiao took a deep breath and didn't waste any more time, accelerating his pace.</p><p></p><p>One step, two steps, three steps... In the eyes of the crowd, the stairway was lit up with each step Ye Xiao took, and he was moving faster and faster, the speed at which the stairway was lit up also becoming faster and faster.</p><p></p><p>Visibly, a beam of light shot up to the sky.</p><p></p><p>The Venerable White Tiger was stunned, stopping his drinking, and North Hall Ce's excited eyes turned red, his fists clenched, unable to say a word.</p><p></p><p>As for the reclusive immortals who had come to watch, after seeing this scene, they were all dumbfounded.</p><p></p><p>"Damn it!"</p><p>"Am I hallucinating? How can this guy be going up so fast? Who is he? Where did he come from?"</p><p>"The Nine Realms, it seems that a dragon is about to emerge this time."</p><p>"Too strong! In the face of this guy, what are the previous supreme geniuses of the Nine Realms?"</p><p>"When did our Nine Realms produce such an extraordinary and invincible prodigy?"</p><p></p><p>The shock did not stop, Ye Xiao's speed was very fast, and in the blink of an eye, one-fifth of the stairway was completed.</p><p></p><p>Then half of the stairway, then three-quarters of the stairway, until finally, he easily reached the top.</p><p></p><p>The entire process was smooth and effortless, not even taking an hour.</p><p></p><p>This was with him showing respect to the dragon vein, not using any cultivation techniques. If he had used cultivation techniques, he might have reached the top in an instant.</p><p></p><p>The Venerable White Tiger stared blankly at the stairway that had lit up to the sky, and his delicate body couldn't help but tremble slightly.</p><p></p><p>"North Hall Ce, where did you find this prodigy? Are you sure he is truly human? I feel like he doesn't seem human."</p><p></p><p>North Hall Ce suppressed his laughter, but dared not be reckless, and could only say:</p><p></p><p>"Venerable, don't worry, he is 100% human, a blood descendant of our Nine Realms!"</p><p></p><p>The onlookers also began to get excited and exhilarated.</p><p></p><p>It was as if the one who had ascended the stairway was not Ye Xiao, but them.</p><p></p><p>"He did it! He really did it!"</p><p>"Forty-three minutes and five seconds, a brand new record, this is a brand new record. And not only here, even if all the dragon veins in the Nine Realms are combined, his achievement is still the best."</p><p>"The number one in the Nine Realms, absolutely the number one in the Nine Realms!"</p><p>"What a genius! Compared to him, I feel like I'm just a piece of trash."</p><p>"Compared to him? Are you worthy? You're not even on the same level."</p><p>"I was wrong, I'm not worthy."</p><p>"Ah! It's really true that people are jealous of others' success. I feel that I, a Grand Master at the Innate Fifth Rank, already have excellent talent, but compared to him, I instantly feel like I'm just a piece of trash."</p><p>"I dare to declare that this person will surely become an Emperor!"</p><p>"Stop talking nonsense!"</p><p></p><p>This is the second update, 6,000 words.</p><p></p><p>Please recommend, vote, and subscribe.</p><p></p><p>Thank you to readers Huan Xiao Meng, hgggggg, Tian Di Xue Mo, BiggieLi, and 20170625210608748 for your donations, greatly appreciated.</p><p></p><p>(This chapter is complete)</p>

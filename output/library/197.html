        <h1>Chapter 197</h1>
        <div class="content">
            <p>Here is the full English translation of the Chinese excerpt:</p><p></p><p>The Taixuan Tiangong is in the realm of spiritual power, so it doesn't count.</p><p></p><p>The claw technique is the most suitable.</p><p></p><p>It can be used to attack, and also to control.</p><p></p><p>If he had the claw technique last time, he could have used it to remotely pull Qin Yuyan back.</p><p></p><p>Just like in a game, control skills are very important.</p><p></p><p>However, just as Ye Xiao was steadily improving, his phone suddenly rang.</p><p></p><p>It was Wang Dalong calling.</p><p></p><p>"What's the matter?" </p><p></p><p>Ye Xiao answered the phone, and heard Wang Dalong's chuckle on the other end.</p><p></p><p>"Boss Ye, about those flowers you wanted before, do you still want them?"</p><p></p><p>"Didn't you say they were hard to find? How come you have them now?"</p><p></p><p>"Well, recently the spiritual energy in the Southwest Forest Sea has been quite abundant, and I heard a lot of people have found some rare spiritual treasures there. </p><p></p><p>I'm also planning to go take a look. If you still want them, I can keep an eye out. If I can't find them myself, I can try to buy them from others, and you can give me a commission fee."</p><p></p><p>"Alright, but I don't have too much money on hand, so I may not be able to buy a lot."</p><p></p><p>"Then I'll just get a smaller amount."</p><p></p><p>After hanging up the phone, Ye Xiao started pondering.</p><p></p><p>"Looks like there are a lot of good things in the Southwest Forest Sea recently! With just the few hundred thousand I have, I won't be able to buy much good stuff.</p><p></p><p>Should I go to the Southwest Forest Sea myself?</p><p></p><p>After all, since I've cultivated spiritual techniques, my efficiency in searching would definitely be much higher than others."</p><p></p><p>Su Shan was very skilled at making honey, which contained abundant spiritual energy and could be used as a top-grade medicinal pill.</p><p></p><p>Her current abilities could still be of some use to him, but if his own strength continued to improve and his demand for spiritual energy increased, her honey might not have as strong an effect.</p><p></p><p>It would be best to seize the opportunity now, when her honey can provide him with a significant boost, to go find some top-grade flowers and have her create even more and better honey, so he can break through to the Xiantian Ninth Grade.</p><p></p><p>That's what he decided to do.</p><p></p><p>Ye Xiao went to the director's office to find Director Ouyang.</p><p></p><p>"What? You want to take leave again?"</p><p></p><p>In the office, Ouyang Yunzhong raised his eyebrows, his expression seeming a bit displeased.</p><p></p><p>"Little Ye, I know you're a young man. Young people are often impulsive and passionate. After getting a taste, it's easy to become addicted.</p><p></p><p>But the more that's the case, the more you need to exercise restraint.</p><p></p><p>You're still young, in the prime of your career, how can you keep running off to meet female internet friends?"</p><p></p><p>Ye Xiao: "..."</p><p></p><p>"This time I'm not going to meet a female internet friend, I have some private matters to take care of."</p><p></p><p>"Oh, that's good then. Ye Xiao, you're an old subordinate I've personally nurtured. I don't want to hide anything from you. Recently our library has another big move in the works. While I'm still the library director, if you perform well, I can promote you further."</p><p></p><p>"Another big move?"</p><p></p><p>Ye Xiao was slightly puzzled.</p><p></p><p>Ouyang Yunzhong said in a low voice, "I'll tell you this just between the two of us, don't spread it around.</p><p></p><p>That Sword Immortal Senior has already raised the spiritual energy absorption speed of our Jianghai City's spiritual gathering formation to the level of a first-tier city. </p><p></p><p>Because of this, Jianghai City will be expanded again.</p><p></p><p>And our library, as Jianghai City's supporting library, will definitely be expanded again as well.</p><p></p><p>Maybe in the future, we'll even be qualified to record Grandmaster-level or above cultivation techniques."</p><p></p><p>Ye Xiao was stunned, completely not expecting such a thing to happen.</p><p></p><p>He had originally just wanted to seal the spiritual gathering formation to use as his own divine beast breeding ground, just incidentally helping Jianghai City improve its spiritual energy.</p><p></p><p>But he never imagined it would bring about such huge changes for Jianghai City.</p><p></p><p>And Grandmaster-level or above cultivation techniques, could it be that imperial arts will be recorded in this library? If that's the case, wouldn't he no longer need to go out and capture divine beasts to obtain imperial arts, but could just directly learn them in the library?</p><p></p><p>This would be a good thing.</p><p></p><p>After all, it would save him a lot of trouble, just needing to read books every day to grow stronger.</p><p></p><p>Perfect?</p><p></p><p>In that case, Ye Xiao even started to think about whether he should further expand the scale of his breeding ground? If the breeding ground was expanded, the spiritual gathering formation would have greater benefits, making the spiritual energy absorption speed even stronger, which would also attract more attention from above.</p><p></p><p>It's even possible that Jianghai City, this small place, could be promoted to a top-tier martial arts city like Shucheng.</p><p></p><p>In that case, not only could he obtain more imperial art cultivation techniques, but he could also have divine beast-level spirit beasts to supplement his blood and spiritual energy, so his cultivation speed would definitely be very fast.</p><p></p><p>"But anyway, although I want to promote you, you also need to have the corresponding strength to match.</p><p></p><p>If the library is expanded and more powerful cultivation techniques are recorded, there will definitely be certain requirements for the management team's martial arts cultivation.</p><p></p><p>Your current Houtian Third Grade cultivation is far from enough.</p><p></p><p>I previously told you that you and Fa Zheng are quite close, so he can teach you more, but you weren't willing at the time. But now, if you want to progress further, you have to change your mindset and improve your strength.</p><p></p><p>Also, I heard that..."</p><p></p><p>Here is the full English translation of the Chinese excerpt:</p><p></p><p>Seeing that Ye Xiao was also getting quite close to following Liu Chengxun, it would be even more ideal. A little guidance from him would be enough for Ye Xiao to benefit for the rest of his life.</p><p></p><p>"Don't miss this good opportunity," Ouyang Yunzhong said with a nod, perfunctorily.</p><p></p><p>If the library really needed to be expanded, in order to gain access to the imperial techniques, his identity couldn't be too low, so it would be appropriate to display his cultivation a bit.</p><p></p><p>For example, reaching the fourth or fifth rank. With his current strength, they wouldn't be able to see through his true cultivation, so he could freely control the level.</p><p></p><p>And externally, he could also say that he learned from Liu Chengxun and Fa Zheng, which is why his cultivation improved so quickly.</p><p></p><p>Seeing that Ye Xiao was no longer stubborn this time, Ouyang Yunzhong nodded approvingly and gave him a leave pass.</p><p></p><p>With the leave pass in hand, Ye Xiao prepared to head to the Southwest Forest Sea.</p><p></p><p>As he left the director's office, he saw Fa Zheng on the fifth floor, reading a book. His cultivation had already broken through to the true sixth rank.</p><p></p><p>This meant that he had seen the heart cultivation method Ye Xiao had left for him.</p><p></p><p>With that heart cultivation method as a foundation, he shouldn't have any problems dealing with that Buddhist cultivator from India.</p><p></p><p>Even if he couldn't win, he wouldn't be utterly defeated.</p><p></p><p>Thereupon, he left the library.</p><p></p><p>The Central State City, the central alliance of the Nine Provinces.</p><p></p><p>This was the center of the entire Central State, controlling the decision-making of all the cities in the Central State.</p><p></p><p>The highest decision-maker in charge of the central alliance was the Vice Alliance Master, Lin Chenggan.</p><p></p><p>In addition to the Grand Alliance Master, the Nine Province Alliance also had nine Vice Alliance Masters, each stationed in one of the nine provinces.</p><p></p><p>As for the Emperor, there had been no Emperor in the Nine Provinces, or the entire world, for several hundred years.</p><p></p><p>At this moment, an urgent intelligence report was quietly transmitted and delivered to Lin Chenggan's hands.</p><p></p><p>"Alliance Master Lin, this is an urgent report from Qin Province."</p><p></p><p>Lin Chenggan took the intelligence report, glanced at it, and immediately stood up.</p><p></p><p>The secretary who had brought the report couldn't help but be slightly shocked when she saw this.</p><p></p><p>In the many years she had been by the Alliance Master's side, she rarely saw him with such an expression.</p><p></p><p>When he had such an expression, it meant that the urgent report was absolutely extraordinary.</p><p></p><p>"Master, are you alright?" she asked.</p><p></p><p>Lin Chenggan pushed up his glasses, his face grave as he said, "I'm fine. Immediately send someone to find the Sword God Li Liushui in the Extreme North Ice Field. Tell him that the Beast God Pact's Dragon Slayer has broken out of the Heavenly Demon Cliff and has already entered the Central State."</p><p></p><p>"Yes."</p><p></p><p>The secretary's heartbeat suddenly accelerated.</p><p></p><p>She finally understood why the Master's expression looked so grim.</p><p></p><p>Dragon Slayer, that was a name with an extremely legendary aura.</p><p></p><p>In this world, there were many opposing forces - the Beasts and the Human Clan, the Human Clan and the Beastmen, the Beasts and the Beastmen, even conflicts within the same race had reached the point of being like fire and water.</p><p></p><p>Many forces, just by seeing each other, might fight to the death.</p><p></p><p>But there were some people who were exceptions to this. These were the powerful experts who transcended the rules of the entire world.</p><p></p><p>They acted without any rules, and no rules could constrain them.</p><p></p><p>Sometimes, even if the two sides were hostile camps, they might sit down together to drink and chat.</p><p></p><p>Because they were too strong. So strong that if they really fought each other, it might cause mountains to collapse and the earth to crack, resulting in countless innocent lives lost.</p><p></p><p>So these powerful experts, even if their identities were antagonistic, would not act rashly unless it was an urgent situation.</p><p></p><p>Dragon Slayer belonged to this category.</p><p></p><p>A super expert! Arguably the god of the Beastmen in the past few hundred years. He had grown from a Beastman with no background into an unparalleled expert, even reaching a level where he could openly provoke the top ten on the World Dragon Ranking.</p><p></p><p>His strength was unimaginable.</p><p></p><p>As a Beastman, if he was discovered on the land of the Nine Provinces by the Nine Province Alliance, he would inevitably face execution.</p><p></p><p>Dragon Slayer was naturally one of them.</p><p></p><p>But if he appeared at the Central State Alliance Master's mansion right now, even though Lin Chenggan was the Alliance Master of the Central State, he could only respectfully pour water for him, without the slightest complaint.</p><p></p><p>Because he could not resist him. Recklessly provoking him would only lead to the death of the Central State and many innocent civilians.</p><p></p><p>The only thing he could do was not to provoke him to anger.</p><p></p><p>That's why his expression was so grave, because he had become a floating duckweed whose own safety, even the safety of the Nine Provinces, was uncertain.</p><p></p><p>This was the power of the strong. In the face of the strong, all rights, wealth, and honor were but smoke and clouds.</p><p></p><p>This was also the reason why he wanted to summon the Sword God Li Liushui.</p><p></p><p>Looking across the entire surface of the Nine Provinces, those who could match Dragon Slayer could probably be counted on one hand.</p><p></p><p>And Li Liushui was one of them.</p>

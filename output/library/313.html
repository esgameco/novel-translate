        <h1>Chapter 313</h1>
        <div class="content">
            <p>Here is the full English translation of the Chinese excerpt:</p><p></p><p>The entire sword beam lasted a full ten seconds.</p><p></p><p>After ten seconds, the sword beam disappeared like thunderous lightning, and along with it, the nearly thousand starbeast spiritual energy ships.</p><p></p><p>In the sky above, it was as if it had been washed clean, becoming incredibly clear. The azure sky could be seen clearly, as if there was not a single obstruction in the sky, right before their eyes.</p><p></p><p>The entire Jianghai City fell into a deathly silence, and a full one-fifth of the Nine States' population, looking at the clean and clear sky with not even a wisp of a cloud, were completely petrified.</p><p></p><p>What was this situation? Where were the myriad spiritual energy ships? They had all disappeared in the blink of an eye? All destroyed by that soaring sword beam!</p><p></p><p>Was that even possible? They were continuously attacking, using the impact force generated from the attacks to reach right in front of him, yet they were forcefully pushed back, and their nearly thousand spiritual energy ships were all destroyed along with it.</p><p></p><p>It would require a strength at least three times greater than the opponent to be able to do this! In addition to this, there would also need to be the power to annihilate the starbeasts on the nearly thousand spiritual energy ships.</p><p></p><p>Although they did not know how much power that would require, and could not even imagine this level of power, they knew that it was a power that none of the people here could collectively manifest.</p><p></p><p>"Sword Immortal! It must be the Sword Immortal!" Someone shouted, and everyone started to get excited.</p><p></p><p>"So amazing, the Sword Immortal senior really lives up to his reputation!"</p><p></p><p>"Haha, those damned starbeasts, now they know how powerful he is! Jianghai City is not a place you can just come to as you please!"</p><p></p><p>"Wah, I didn't know the Sword Immortal was this powerful before, I even mocked him online, but now seeing this, I realize how much of an idiot I was. From now on, anyone who dares to slander the Sword Immortal, I'll fight them to the death!"</p><p></p><p>Dou Changfeng looked at his own armor, not knowing whether to laugh or cry.</p><p></p><p>"I prepared all this gear, but the Sword Immortal senior resolved it all with a single sword strike, making my armor completely useless."</p><p></p><p>But after a moment, he couldn't help but exclaim:</p><p></p><p>"Sword Immortal senior, for Jianghai City to have you, it is truly a blessing accumulated over thousands of years."</p><p></p><p>He reignited his determination. As long as the Sword Immortal was here, what was there to be afraid of? As long as the Sword Immortal was here, Jianghai City would be safe!</p><p></p><p>In front of the library, the young Weiwu, hiding behind Ning Yuhen, stared intently at the distant Ye Xiao, her mind completely blown.</p><p></p><p>Was this the legendary Empyrean expert? With just a single sword strike, he had swept away the starbeasts' fleet of nearly a thousand spiritual energy ships. This level of power was indescribable.</p><p></p><p>Especially considering this was under the Seven Star Convergence, where many of the starbeasts had been enhanced. Even the leaders, who were only at the Spiritual Beast level, had been boosted to an even greater power, with many likely reaching the Half-Step Supernal level!</p><p></p><p>Weiwu did not believe that there was not a single Half-Step Supernal starbeat among the nearly thousand spiritual energy ships. Yet, not a single one had escaped Ye Xiao's sword strike.</p><p></p><p>The gap between the Empyrean realm and the Supernal starbeasts had widened to such an extent?</p><p></p><p>Ye Xiao looked up at the sky, unable to help but let out a long sigh, his heart bleeding.</p><p></p><p>So many bountiful ingredients, all gone in an instant, what a waste! Such a shame!</p><p></p><p>But he had no choice. If he had fought alone, he could have entered the fray and slowly slain them, preserving their corpses. But with so many people here, nearly one-fifth of the Nine States' population taking refuge, if he fought slowly, he risked accidentally causing the deaths of countless people.</p><p></p><p>Even a single spiritual energy cannon shot to the ground could kill thousands, and a Spiritual Beast's attack would be even more devastating, possibly annihilating tens of thousands with a single strike.</p><p></p><p>"Manager, why are you sighing?" Ning Yuhen had come to Ye Xiao's side.</p><p></p><p>Ye Xiao tilted his head up 45 degrees. "I'm worried about the future of the human race. This was just the first wave of attack, with nearly a thousand spiritual energy ships. I don't know what kind of powerful experts will come next. I can still help them hold out for now, but when the truly powerful ones arrive, I don't know if I'll be able to protect them."</p><p></p><p>Ning Yuhen's heart trembled, and she looked at Ye Xiao with deep admiration.</p><p></p><p>"No wonder the Manager is so powerful, even though he has already reached such heights, he is still concerned about the future of the human race. With such a broad vision, it's no wonder he is so formidable."</p><p></p><p>Ye Xiao was truly humble. He had already reached the legendary Empyrean realm, destroying the nearly thousand spiritual energy ships with a single strike, annihilating countless starbeasts, yet he was still worried about encountering even stronger opponents. </p><p></p><p>Compared to him, Ning Yuhen felt her own cultivation was still lacking. She decided she would serve as his attendant for a hundred years, learning from him during that time.</p><p></p><p>At this moment, some Deity Sect experts had started to gather around them.</p><p></p><p>Here is the full English translation of the Chinese excerpt:</p><p></p><p>This place was gathered with a large number of people from the Nine Realms, so naturally there were also some super experts.</p><p></p><p>Among these super experts, there were naturally many Shen Zong powerhouses.</p><p></p><p>Ye Xiao did not wait for them to appear, he just casually grabbed the void and reactivated the defensive formation, then quickly returned to the dormitory.</p><p></p><p>Ning Yuthen knew that Ye Xiao's temperament was calm and he did not like to expose his identity in front of too many people, so he grabbed Youwei's shoulder, picked her up, and quickly followed him into the library.</p><p></p><p>As soon as they left, there were many figures quickly flying over.</p><p></p><p>"The center point of the attack just now seems to be right here."</p><p></p><p>"But why didn't we see anyone?"</p><p></p><p>"It's such a pity that I wasn't here just now. If I had been, I could have seen the legendary Sword Immortal senior. Then I would have no regrets in this life."</p><p></p><p>"After this, I won't leave Jianghai City anymore. The only meaning of my life now is to see the Sword Immortal senior!"</p><p></p><p>At the same time, Hanzhou had become a scene of chaos and destruction, a picture of the apocalypse.</p><p></p><p>In fact, everywhere in the world except the Nine Realms was similar to Hanzhou now.</p><p></p><p>The Star Beasts' spiritual energy ships had already carried out a massive bombardment before landing.</p><p></p><p>After this wave, the casualties of the human race in Hanzhou were nearly 40%!</p><p></p><p>This was because the Star Beasts wanted to devour the essence blood of the human race, so they did not use the spiritual energy ships to excessively bombard.</p><p></p><p>Otherwise, the entire Hanzhou would have been completely destroyed.</p><p></p><p>But the humans who were not bombed were actually worse off than those who were blasted to pieces.</p><p></p><p>Because those who were blasted to pieces at least would not suffer so much pain.</p><p></p><p>The humans who escaped the spiritual energy cannon were the ones truly facing the hell on earth.</p><p></p><p>With numbers and strength inferior to the Star Beasts, they were brutally slaughtered by the Star Beasts and became their food.</p><p></p><p>Just like tiny ants, they didn't even have the ability to resist.</p><p></p><p>Liu Chengxun, who returned to Hanzhou, was not doing any better.</p><p></p><p>The ferocity of this beast disaster was far beyond his imagination.</p><p></p><p>Coupled with the Seven Star Convergence, the powerful Star Beasts came in wave after wave.</p><p></p><p>The only relatively good thing was that the lack of spiritual energy in Hanzhou did not attract too many Star Beasts.</p><p></p><p>Because the lack of spiritual energy meant that there would not be too many powerful experts, and the divine blood in the human race's bloodline would also weaken faster and more.</p><p></p><p>To put it simply, the powerful Star Beast forces did not find Hanzhou attractive.</p><p></p><p>If it were not for this, he would not have been able to survive until now, and he might have already died.</p><p></p><p>Even so, six Shen Zong-level Star Beasts of the Innate Ninth Grade had come to Hanzhou.</p><p></p><p>Liu Chengxun had previously seen Ye Xiao activate the divine blood and release the divine light in the Nine Realms, so he had managed to improve his cultivation to the Innate Ninth Grade Shen Zong, and the imperial sword Ye Xiao had reforged for him had also greatly improved in grade, so his overall strength had increased a lot.</p><p></p><p>Otherwise, at this moment, he would not be able to withstand the attacks of the Star Beast experts.</p><p></p><p>Even so, he did not have the strength to protect the other people, because he himself had been repeatedly retreating under attack, his body covered in wounds, his blue robe completely dyed red.</p><p></p><p>And among the Star Beasts, only one had been slightly injured by him.</p><p></p><p>Boom! Suddenly, one of the Shen Zong peak Star Beasts took advantage of his carelessness and struck him hard on the shoulder, directly blasting him down.</p><p></p><p>Liu Chengxun was blasted like a cannonball, crashing through a large building and then slamming heavily onto the ground, creating a deep pit and shattering the earth.</p><p></p><p>"Pu chi!"</p><p></p><p>Liu Chengxun couldn't help but cough up a mouthful of fresh blood, his pupils beginning to disperse, the light in his eyes gradually fading.</p><p></p><p>He could no longer hold on in the end. It was impossible, the opponent not only had extremely strong strength, but also had a huge numerical advantage. Aside from him, Hanzhou only had one or two Innate Seventh Grade Shen Zong, but they had already been torn apart and devoured by other Star Beasts.</p><p></p><p>Without anyone to share the pressure with him, he could not bear it at all.</p><p></p><p>He had given up resistance.</p><p></p><p>It had come to this point, and he was powerless. Faced with absolute strength, he had no chance of defeating the opponent, and his will to fight had even been shattered.</p><p></p><p>But he had no regrets about the resources Hanzhou had cultivated him with over the years, because he had devoted everything he had.</p><p></p><p>The Star Beasts were already gathering around him, and he seemed to have already seen his own death.</p><p></p><p>Liu Chengxun closed his eyes, the corners of his mouth curving up in self-mockery, mocking his own incompetence.</p><p></p><p>The only regret he had now was that he had never seen the Sword Immortal in his lifetime.</p><p></p><p>That was the idol he had always dreamed of seeing! "Sword Immortal senior, I wonder if in the next life, Liu Chengxun will have the chance to see your venerable appearance!"</p>

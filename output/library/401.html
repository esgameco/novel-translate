        <h1>Chapter 401</h1>
        <div class="content">
            <p>Here is the full English translation of the Chinese excerpt:</p><p></p><p>His talent has reached a level that commands reverence.</p><p></p><p>Within the Xuanyuan Clan, Ning Zhiyuan's talent and cultivation were actually quite low. His strength was only at the Empyrean Realm's 74th Dragon, and even after coming to the human world, he only advanced by one Dragon.</p><p></p><p>Yet he could only rank 17th on the Xuanyuan Prodigy List.</p><p></p><p>The top 10 on the Xuanyuan Prodigy List have all reached cultivations beyond the Divine Realm.</p><p></p><p>The one ranked 3rd, Zheng Fenghua, has already reached above the 6th Layer of the Divine Realm.</p><p></p><p>Besides him, there is another who is only around the 8th Layer of the Divine Realm.</p><p></p><p>But not a single one has reached the Slay-the-Divine Realm.</p><p></p><p>Even Ning Zhiyuan's second uncle, who is over a dozen years older than the Young Master of the Cloud Family, has only reached the 9th Layer of the Divine Realm due to his inferior talent in Ning Zhiyuan's father's generation.</p><p></p><p>Ning Zhiyuan's father and a few other uncles do have Slay-the-Divine Realm experts. </p><p></p><p>But they are already a whole generation above the Young Master of the Cloud Family! Although some are only a dozen or so years older, this further highlights the prodigious talent of the Young Master of the Cloud Family! It's true that the Cloud Family can obtain the direct lineage inheritance of the Xuanyuan Mountain, giving them cultivation methods stronger than other family heirs and the previous generation.</p><p></p><p>The various elixirs and cultivation resources they have access to are also many times stronger than other families, not just a little!</p><p></p><p>This has allowed the creation of the Young Master of the Cloud Family, who at 61 years old has reached the monstrous cultivation of the Slay-the-Divine Realm!</p><p></p><p>But the Young Master of the Cloud Family is still prodigious.</p><p></p><p>Because the Young Master of the Cloud Family is not just at the Slay-the-Divine Realm, he is at the 9th Layer of the Slay-the-Divine Realm!</p><p></p><p>He is the legend of the Cloud Family, and also the legend of the entire Xuanyuan Clan.</p><p></p><p>Ning Zhiyuan is not even 50 years old yet, and when he reaches 61 years old, his strength may only be around the 3rd or 4th Layer of the Divine Realm, completely incomparable to the prodigious talent of the Young Master of the Cloud Family.</p><p></p><p>And now, the Young Master of the Cloud Family actually wants to challenge the Sword-Dao Immortal.</p><p></p><p>What a great honor this is for the Sword-Dao Immortal!</p><p></p><p>"Senior Cloud, is what you said really true?" </p><p></p><p>Cloud Water nodded.</p><p></p><p>"Of course what I said is true, you don't need to doubt it. Just spread this news out."</p><p></p><p>The crowd nodded, but in their hearts, they still couldn't calm down in such a short time.</p><p></p><p>"Senior Cloud, please come into the manor and have some tea. We'll send people to spread the news right away. When is the challenge scheduled for?"</p><p></p><p>"Half a year from now."</p><p></p><p>"Half a year from now, that's so soon?"</p><p></p><p>"This time is still considered slow. If it weren't for our Young Master wanting to stabilize his realm a bit, he would have come directly now."</p><p></p><p>The crowd nodded.</p><p></p><p>But thinking about it carefully, what difference does it make whether it's half a year from now or right now?</p><p></p><p>Although the Sword-Dao Immortal is prodigious, he can't possibly be a match for the other party.</p><p></p><p>Even Ning Zhiyuan and his second uncle, who are more aware of the Sword-Dao Immortal's rate of progress, couldn't help but shake their heads and sigh.</p><p></p><p>Ye Xiao's progress speed is terrifying, far more terrifying than that of the Young Master of the Cloud Family.</p><p></p><p>If the time was extended to six years, it might not be so certain.</p><p></p><p>But six months is too short a time.</p><p></p><p>Ye Xiao absolutely cannot reach the 9th Layer of the Slay-the-Divine Realm in such a short time.</p><p></p><p>Unless he's cheating.</p><p></p><p>No, even cheating wouldn't be enough.</p><p></p><p>On Ye Xiao's side, he learned of this news around noon when he got off work.</p><p></p><p>Because the Ning Family didn't know his location or identity, they didn't know how to contact him.</p><p></p><p>So the Ning Family directly spread the news, letting everyone know about this.</p><p></p><p>Of course, the Ning Family didn't mention the cultivation of the Young Master of the Cloud Family, only letting people know about the challenge.</p><p></p><p>Ye Xiao couldn't help but be a bit stunned.</p><p></p><p>The Young Master of the Cloud Family also wants to challenge him?</p><p></p><p>He feels like he's never even seen this person before.</p><p></p><p>And he also feels like he's never actively provoked anyone from the Cloud Family before. Is the other person just bored and looking to cause him trouble?</p><p></p><p>Previously, he had a conflict with one of the Cloud Family's elders, but that was because the other side sent star beasts to try to kill him, and they ended up being captured by him instead.</p><p></p><p>But the mighty Young Master of the Cloud Family, a prodigy-like figure, surely his heart can't be so small as to come challenge him just for that, right?</p><p></p><p>But if he says he wants to challenge, who does he think he is? Does he think he can just challenge whoever he wants without any consequences? Furthermore, Ye Xiao doesn't even know the other's cultivation level, and he's worried it might be a trap to lure him out and have the entire Xuanyuan Clan pounce on him.</p><p></p><p>So Ye Xiao immediately rejected this challenge in his heart. There's no way he's going to show up.</p><p></p><p>On the other side, in the boundless starry sky, in the forbidden land of the Xuanyuan Clan's Cloud Family, a figure slowly opened his eyes.</p><p></p><p>In those majestic eyes, a hint of helplessness could be seen.</p><p></p><p>Soon, a white-haired elder appeared by his side.</p><p></p><p>"Xuanyuan, still unable to comprehend the higher realms?"</p><p></p><p>The other shook his head.</p><p></p><p>"Grandpa, I'm sorry, I'm just too incapable. With the Xuanyuan bloodline purity far surpassing other direct lineage young masters, and already 61 years old, I still haven't broken through to the Deity Monarch Realm, bringing shame to the Cloud Family and the entire Xuanyuan Clan."</p><p></p><p>"Don't be too hard on yourself..."</p><p></p><p>Here is the full English translation of the Chinese excerpt:</p><p></p><p>In the end, it still comes down to the fact that the bloodline of the Xuanyuan Clan has declined.</p><p></p><p>Back then, we wanted to support the Ancestor Dragon, use him, and break through to the level of Supreme God Emperor to enhance the power of the Xuanyuan Clan's bloodline.</p><p></p><p>Unfortunately, he didn't think much of our Xuanyuan Clan at all, and didn't use even a shred of our clan's resources. After becoming a God Emperor, he severed the bloodline connection with the Xuanyuan Clan, causing the divine blood of the Xuanyuan Clan to miss an opportunity for advancement.</p><p></p><p>Otherwise, at your age, breaking through the God King realm would not have been a problem."</p><p></p><p>Yun Xuanyuan sighed, then spoke again:</p><p></p><p>"Grandpa, I've made a decision."</p><p></p><p>"Is it about that child from the Canglan Star Realm?"</p><p></p><p>Yun Xuanyuan nodded.</p><p></p><p>"He and the Venerable Ancestor Dragon come from the same place. He has an extremely monstrous talent.</p><p></p><p>I don't know how strong he is, nor do I know the extent of his talents. If, in half a year, I fight him and his talents far surpass mine, I hope the Yun Family can abandon me and focus all their efforts on cultivating him.</p><p></p><p>Help him enter the Xuanyuan Mountain and become the new Xuanyuan Holy Son!"</p><p></p><p>The old master of the Yun Family had a complex look in his eyes.</p><p></p><p>"Do you know what you're saying? You're giving up your own great opportunity to become a God Emperor. Without becoming the Holy Son, you won't be able to obtain the true inheritance and God Emperor resources of the Xuanyuan Mountain!"</p><p></p><p>Yun Xuanyuan nodded again.</p><p></p><p>"I understand this better than anyone. But I also understand that even if I become a God Emperor, I won't be able to bring much benefit to the Xuanyuan Clan. My talents can at most reach the first or second level of God Emperor.</p><p></p><p>This level of talent may not even rank in the top thirty among the geniuses of the entire starry sky.</p><p></p><p>The Xuanyuan Clan needs an even more powerful genius.</p><p></p><p>He may not necessarily be able to defeat me, but I hope he can defeat me!</p><p></p><p>If the Xuanyuan Clan can produce a high-level God Emperor, the entire bloodline power of the Xuanyuan Clan will be raised again.</p><p></p><p>Otherwise, in less than a thousand years, the Xuanyuan Clan will decline."</p><p></p><p>The old master of the Yun Family couldn't help but let out a deep sigh.</p><p></p><p>Living in the starry sky, they were destined to have no right to choose their own fate.</p><p></p><p>Everyone wants to become the supreme God Emperor, to become the leader.</p><p></p><p>But who knows the hardships of being a God Emperor? Becoming an existence of that level is not just about cultivating one's own strength.</p><p></p><p>The burden on one's shoulders also becomes heavier.</p><p></p><p>The future of an entire race, countless billions of people, all rests on your shoulders - what a suffocating kind of pressure is that?</p>

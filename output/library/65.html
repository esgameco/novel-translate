        <h1>Chapter 65</h1>
        <div class="content">
            <p>Here is the full English translation of the Chinese excerpt:</p><p></p><p>"Don't worry, I know what I'm doing," Gu Hai replied, hanging up the phone.</p><p></p><p>Ye Xiao put away his phone, and a cold glint flashed in his eyes.</p><p></p><p>In fact, he had been trying to keep a low profile. At least so far, no one knew his true identity.</p><p></p><p>But there were always people who didn't want him to have it easy.</p><p></p><p>He suddenly gained some understanding of the superhero characters in those heroic movies.</p><p></p><p>When your abilities surpass everyone around you, and they can't control you, they feel fear and unease. That's when you become the guilty one.</p><p></p><p>Even if you've never done a single bad thing! You might even be a perfect, upstanding person.</p><p></p><p>You still can't change the prejudices in people's hearts.</p><p></p><p>Humans must put a leash on you, keep you firmly in their grasp, to feel safe. Only then will they consider you a good person.</p><p></p><p>Even if you occasionally kill a few people at this point, no one will touch you.</p><p></p><p>Why? Because now, you're just a dog in their eyes, under their control.</p><p></p><p>You can bring them immense benefits, far exceeding the small cost of your crimes, so those crimes are no longer seen as wrongdoings.</p><p></p><p>This so-called justice is nothing but a lie that the weak cling to in desperation.</p><p></p><p>Ye Xiao was not Superman, nor was he a bad person, but he didn't mind doing a few bad things!</p><p></p><p>Outside the city lord's manor, Mr. Zhao watched the video, his anger boiling over.</p><p></p><p>"Punish them severely, punish them without leniency!" he raged, pacing back and forth, occasionally raising his finger and shouting, "Sentence those few captured guys, each to ten years in prison! A bunch of fools, unable to succeed but good at failing!"</p><p></p><p>Du Tianyü's face was icy cold as he said, "Mr. Zhao, aren't you going too far? They were just discussing the matter, and it was your people who struck first."</p><p></p><p>"Du Tianyü, what do you mean? You still want to protect those few?" </p><p></p><p>"It's not about protecting anyone. I'm just stating the facts. I already disagreed with this matter before. How could we trifle with such powerful experts? And now they've been recognized by a few children, and you want to blame them?"</p><p></p><p>"You...! Fine, fine, fine! Du Tianyü, I see you've really gone off the rails. I'll report this to the Central Province, that you've been incompetent and haven't found any clues to this day."</p><p></p><p>"Go ahead and report it, report whatever you want! You came here just to boost your credentials. You can act recklessly, but I, Du Tianyü, won't. I'm the city lord of Jianghai City! In terms of background, I can't match the people behind you, Zhao sir. At worst, I'll just go back home and farm the land!"</p><p></p><p>"Okay, if you don't want this position, there are plenty of people who do." He was about to continue when suddenly, a golden sword beam dozens of meters long descended straight down, splitting Zhao in half. The raging winds from the sword beam then completely shredded his remains, leaving not a single trace.</p><p></p><p>The sword beam continued its momentum, crashing into the ground and creating a massive trench stretching over a hundred meters.</p><p></p><p>Dust and smoke filled the air as the city guards quickly gathered.</p><p></p><p>"Enemy attack! Enemy attack!"</p><p>"Quickly, protect the city lord!"</p><p></p><p>The commotion was chaotic and panicked.</p><p></p><p>As for Du Tianyü, he just stood there dumbfounded. He didn't need to think twice to know that the mysterious powerful expert who had struck was one of them.</p><p></p><p>He just didn't expect the person to say "kill" and then actually do it, giving Zhao no chance at all. This ruthless method scared him so much that he didn't dare move a muscle, his entire body breaking out in cold sweat.</p><p></p><p>After a while, he finally reacted and looked around. Aside from the guards, there was no one else there.</p><p></p><p>This made him breathe a slight sigh of relief.</p><p></p><p>It seems the person had already left.</p><p></p><p>But looking at the sword mark on the ground, he...</p><p></p><p>Here is the full English translation of the Chinese excerpt:</p><p></p><p>The expression on his face became serious again. <div class="contentadv"><script>loadAdv(7,3);</script></div> The other party was able to hear their conversation in complete silence, their cultivation was truly too high.</p><p></p><p>The other party could have easily killed the one surnamed Zhao in silence, but they didn't. What does this mean? This means that they didn't even consider the Zhao family of the capital city worthy of their attention, which is why they dared to openly execute the one surnamed Zhao right in front of them.</p><p></p><p>It's as if they were trampling on them like ants.</p><p></p><p>This is also an indirect way of telling them that they don't want to be bothered.</p><p></p><p>Otherwise, next time, it won't just be one person surnamed Zhao who dies.</p><p></p><p>It's a threat, as well as a warning.</p><p></p><p>After taking a deep breath, Dou Tianyu's face became solemn as he said, "Tonight's incident, no one is allowed to disclose it."</p><p></p><p>"Yes!"</p><p></p><p>The crowd responded in unison. In fact, even if Dou Tianyu didn't say it, they wouldn't dare to casually talk about it.</p><p></p><p>That was a great master, after all.</p><p></p><p>Mysterious and elusive, killing people was as simple as eating and drinking for them.</p><p></p><p>With such a person, who would dare to provoke them? Even if you had a hundred heads, it wouldn't be enough for them to chop off!" Furthermore, release the few young people in the prison. And from today onwards, no one in the entire Jianghai City is allowed to discuss the matter of those two powerful figures on the internet. All related posts must be deleted, and no subsequent posts will be allowed to pass the review."</p><p></p><p>"Yes!"</p><p></p><p>After issuing several orders in succession, Dou Tianyu quickly walked into the city lord's mansion to report the matter to his superior.</p><p></p><p>After hearing his report, the superior was silent for a moment, then praised Dou Tianyu's handling of the situation.</p><p></p><p>"You've handled this matter quite well. From today on, no one is to pay attention to those powerful figures anymore."</p><p></p><p>"Yes, about Mr. Zhao..."</p><p></p><p>"He deserved his fate. Write a report on this matter and submit it truthfully. I believe the Zhao family, upon seeing it, won't have anything to say."</p><p></p><p>After hanging up the phone, Dou Tianyu let out a long sigh.</p><p></p><p>He knew that this matter was now completely settled.</p><p></p><p>Ultimately, no matter how high one's status, it is still inferior to actual strength.</p><p></p><p>The other party had several, possibly even stronger than the great masters! If there's anyone to blame, it's only the Zhao family for cultivating such a foolish person who acted without considering the consequences.</p><p></p><p>However, this also made him couldn't help but curious.</p><p></p><p>What exactly brought these powerful figures to Jianghai City? Was there some secret in Jianghai City? After thinking for a while, he couldn't figure out the reason and could only shake his head and go write the report.</p><p></p><p>At this time, Ye Xiao had already appeared on a few streets away.</p><p></p><p>The reason he didn't step forward was not because he was afraid of others recognizing his appearance. He only needed to move his thoughts a little to erase the other party's memories of him.</p><p></p><p>The reason he didn't step forward was simply because he felt that dealing with the likes of the Zhao family was too low-level for him.</p><p></p><p>If it weren't for the fact that he didn't want to kill them, they would have continued to cause trouble. Ye Xiao was too lazy to even bother lifting a hand.</p><p></p><p>It would dirty his own hands.</p><p></p><p>Dou Tianyu, the city lord, was still a decent person, so Ye Xiao left him alone.</p><p></p><p>After this incident, it should have conveyed his message. Probably the alliance won't come looking for him again.</p><p></p><p>Of course, it's best if they don't come.</p><p></p><p>If they do, they won't be going back.</p><p></p><p>This is the first update, please support the new book.</p><p></p><p>Thank you to book friends 20200313032610777, 明月窗前照, 庄周战周工, 流氓hh, and 黎大帝 for the donations, greatly appreciated.</p><p></p><p>This chapter was actually written this morning, but I deleted and revised it until I felt it was appropriate before releasing it. Sorry for the late release.</p><p></p><p>(This chapter is complete)</p>

        <h1>Chapter 220</h1>
        <div class="content">
            <p>Here is the full English translation of the Chinese excerpt:</p><p></p><p>"Damn it! Another member of our tribe has fallen victim to that scoundrel's vicious hand."</p><p></p><p>"I really don't know which brother was so unlucky! To actually run into that bastard."</p><p></p><p>The star beasts were quietly discussing amongst themselves using their divine thoughts.</p><p></p><p>Nolphius' split body was also very curious. Just who was so unfortunate to get captured, and this aura, why did it feel a bit familiar? Almost like it was similar to his own?</p><p></p><p>If it weren't for the fact that he knew his main body was currently at Shaolin, he would have even suspected that this was his own main body.</p><p></p><p>The other star beasts were also sneaking glances.</p><p></p><p>"Huh? This star beast looks a bit like Senior Nolphius."</p><p></p><p>"Hey, you're right. It really does look like him!"</p><p></p><p>"Could it be one of Senior Nolphius' relatives?"</p><p></p><p>Nolphius' heart sank, and he suddenly had an uneasy feeling. He immediately raised his tentacles and took a secret peek.</p><p></p><p>"Noâ€”!"</p><p></p><p>The moment he saw it, he instantly spat out a mouthful of fresh blood.</p><p></p><p>What the hell?</p><p></p><p>Did it have to be so dramatic?</p><p></p><p>Wasn't his main body supposed to be at Shaolin? How could it appear in this place?</p><p></p><p>The other star beasts, seeing him cough up blood, couldn't help but get a huge fright.</p><p></p><p>"Senior Nolphius, are you alright? Why are you coughing up blood?"</p><p></p><p>"What nonsense! My main body has been captured and brought here, why do you think I'm coughing up blood?"</p><p></p><p>The star beasts were collectively dumbfounded.</p><p></p><p>So... this was really Senior Nolphius' main body?</p><p></p><p>Even his main body had been captured by this kid?</p><p></p><p>Ye Xiao spoke up indifferently:</p><p></p><p>"You're all old acquaintances, and this guy is also Nolphius' main body. I won't disturb your reunion. Take your time chatting. After you're done, you can merge back together.</p><p></p><p>Starting from tomorrow, the materials you need to submit every day cannot be changed.</p><p></p><p>Whoever delays me, I don't mind directly refining them into medicinal pills.</p><p></p><p>After all, the beast calamity is about to arrive soon, and there will be plenty of star beasts to replace you."</p><p></p><p>Ye Xiao finished speaking and turned to leave.</p><p></p><p>The star beasts were so angry they were about to jump up and kick him.</p><p></p><p>"Damn that human, actually being so arrogant towards us!"</p><p></p><p>"I wish I could cut him into a thousand pieces, swallow him alive, and scatter his bones!"</p><p></p><p>"I want to give birth to a son and beat him ten thousand times a day!"</p><p></p><p>Nolphius' split body couldn't be bothered to pay attention to them.</p><p></p><p>He rushed straight towards his main body and directly started whipping him with his tentacles.</p><p></p><p>"Wake up quickly. How dare you sleep here?"</p><p></p><p>The main body, after being woken up, looked somewhat confused when he saw the split body.</p><p></p><p>"Am I in the underworld? I'm actually seeing my split body? This must be a dream."</p><p></p><p>"Dream your grandma's spring and autumn! You're not dead, and you've been captured by someone to be their livestock!"</p><p></p><p>The main body was startled. Livestock? He wasn't dead? He had been captured by that human and was being kept as livestock together with the split body? What a joke! "The main body would never become livestock!"</p><p></p><p>The split body rubbed his head, almost on the verge of a breakdown.</p><p></p><p>"You think being livestock is something you can just refuse to do? Just tell me, why did you come to Jianghai City?"</p><p></p><p>"I came to rescue you! We're one and the same. I managed to escape from Shaolin, of course I had to come save you."</p><p></p><p>"Rescue my ass! Now we're both done for. Originally, as long as you didn't come, at least one of us could have survived. Now look, neither of us is going to make it.</p><p></p><p>Damn it!"</p><p></p><p>The split body had been completely exasperated, even forgetting that they were originally one and the same, with the same mother.</p><p></p><p>On Ye Xiao's side, he had already returned home and immediately handed the eight tentacles he had cut from Nolphius' main body to Huan Liuli.</p><p></p><p>"Prepare all these tentacles, I'll eat them later."</p><p></p><p>Huan Liuli was stunned.</p><p></p><p>"Master, we already harvested one of Nolphius' tentacles today. Why did you cut off eight more of his main body's tentacles?"</p><p></p><p>"This is his main body!"</p><p></p><p>Huan Liuli paused for a moment, then her head suddenly exploded.</p><p></p><p>Master had actually captured Nolphius' main body as well?</p><p></p><p>Wow! This was too amazing! If she remembered correctly, Nolphius' main body was a peak Xiantian Ninth Realm Saint-Emperor existence!</p><p></p><p>Master was just too powerful! She must stick close to the master and never leave. Three thousand years wasn't enough, she might as well stay for a lifetime. As long as the master didn't die, she wouldn't leave.</p><p></p><p>Becoming the master's devoted little Sophia, serving him until he was laid in his coffin.</p><p></p><p>After dealing with the star beast meat, Ye Xiao immediately took out his phone and called Liu Chengxun.</p><p></p><p>"Old Liu, the matter with the sword is settled. He said he can repair it, but it will take at least a year. But he can guarantee restoring the sword to exactly the same state as before."</p><p></p><p>Because the time required for weapon forgers to refine weapons was generally quite long. Especially for this level of Imperial Weapon, there were very few weapon forgers in the world who could refine it.</p><p></p><p>The few remaining top-tier weapon forgers, although they could repair it, the time required was too long.</p><p></p><p>If Ye Xiao had said the time was very short, that would have been a lie.</p><p></p><p>Even though he could repair this sword in just a few minutes.</p><p></p><p>From the other end of the phone, Ye Xiao heard Liu Chengxun's excited voice.</p><p></p><p>"Really?"</p><p></p><p>"Of course."</p><p></p><p>Here is my translation of the Chinese excerpt:</p><p></p><p>"Ye Xiao, thank you!" </p><p></p><p>This time, Liu Chengxun even directly called his name, the tone exceptionally solemn.</p><p></p><p>It was very clear that he was truly excited and truly happy.</p><p></p><p>"You're welcome."</p><p></p><p>Ye Xiao gave a faint smile, bid him farewell, and hung up the phone.</p><p></p><p>This person Liu Chengxun was not bad, so he had helped him.</p><p></p><p>Next, it was to first get this sword repaired.</p><p></p><p>Ye Xiao directly displayed his supernatural craftsmanship.</p><p></p><p>However, he also added a little something for Liu Chengxun.</p><p></p><p>A favor deserves a return, since Liu Chengxun always thought of himself and had previously gifted him elixirs, he couldn't be too stingy either.</p><p></p><p>Moreover, Liu Chengxun had been in Jianghai City for a long time, a year from now when Ye Xiao gave him the sword, he might not have left.</p><p></p><p>That way, if Ye Xiao was no longer in Jianghai City in the future, and Liu Chengxun encountered some super strong expert who wanted to harm Jianghai City? With a good sword in hand, he could better protect Jianghai City.</p><p></p><p>He used some special materials to greatly enhance Liu Chengxun's sword.</p><p></p><p>Originally it could not be considered a true imperial weapon, it could even be said to be a secondary imperial weapon, but now it was a truly perfect imperial weapon!</p><p></p><p>Next time it encountered such a degree of damage, it was estimated that it could self-repair.</p><p></p><p>And true imperial weapons were also not easy to repair.</p><p></p><p>After taking care of this matter, Ye Xiao began to gather his luggage, storing it in his storage ring, then came downstairs.</p><p></p><p>Huan Liuli had already prepared a portion of Nuoerfisi's tentacles. Activating spiritual energy to drive the flames, they would soon be ready, and Huan Liuli piled them up in the courtyard like a small mountain.</p><p></p><p>This was just one tentacle, if all the tentacles were completed, this courtyard would definitely not be able to hold them.</p><p></p><p>This made Ye Xiao start to rethink a new problem.</p><p></p><p>As the star beasts became more and more numerous and larger, in the future should he get a bigger house, or re-excavate the basement of this house and make an underground dining room, specifically for eating the meat of the star beasts?</p><p></p><p>Otherwise, with so much of this, if someone saw it, there would inevitably be some suspicion.</p><p></p><p>He took a bite, and sure enough, the meat was tender, crisp, and chewy.</p><p></p><p>Biting into it, the oil that burst open in his mouth at the perfect temperature was simply mind-blowingly delicious.</p><p></p><p>It was truly worthy of being Nuoerfisi's main body, a ninth-grade innate existence, far surpassing the separated parts.</p><p></p><p>While eating, he instructed:</p><p></p><p>"Huan Liuli, I'm going to the Central State to study for a month, during this one month, you stay well at home. Remember to harvest the resources in the breeding ground on time and in the proper amount every day."</p><p></p><p>"Master, don't worry, I will definitely complete the task at home."</p><p></p><p>Ye Xiao nodded and continued to eat the star beast's meat in silence.</p><p></p><p>Two days later, he and Yang Qian, as well as a few other colleagues, finally boarded the high-speed rail to the Central State.</p><p></p><p>After more than an hour of a long journey, they arrived in the Central State.</p><p></p><p>This was not the first time he had come to a big city.</p><p></p><p>It's just that this was the first time he had come to the Central State.</p><p></p><p>The Central State did not give Ye Xiao too much of a shock.</p><p></p><p>At most, it was much larger in scale than Jianghai City.</p><p></p><p>But for someone like Ye Xiao, who had even been to a top-tier city like Shu City, naturally there was nothing too extraordinary about it.</p><p></p><p>This time, to ensure his own supply and demand, Ye Xiao prepared a lot of resources at once.</p><p></p><p>Including but not limited to star beast meat, eggs, honey, milk...</p><p></p><p>Basically, he brought everything he could.</p><p></p><p>Although he came to the Central State to study, in reality, his true purpose was to come here to read a few books and find some good cultivation techniques.</p><p></p><p>He was here to cultivate.</p><p></p><p>"We've finally arrived in the Central State!"</p><p></p><p>"After we put our things in the hotel, let's go out and play for a while. It's not easy to come to the Central State, is it?"</p><p></p><p>"Yes, we haven't started studying yet, and if we just stay in the hotel, it'll be so boring."</p><p></p><p>"Okay, okay, I'll go too."</p><p></p><p>"Count me in as well."</p><p></p><p>"Me too!"</p><p></p><p>Among them, only Ye Xiao had no intention of going.</p><p></p><p>Yang Qian couldn't help but ask puzzledly:</p><p></p><p>"How come? Manager, you just arrived here, aren't you going to play with us?"</p><p></p><p>Ye Xiao shook his head.</p><p></p><p>"I won't go. I'm a bit tired and want to rest in the hotel for a while. You all go and play!"</p><p></p><p>"Okay then, we'll go by ourselves."</p><p></p><p>Ye Xiao nodded and bid them farewell.</p><p></p><p>The beast disaster wouldn't last much longer, who still had the heart to play?</p><p></p><p>After checking in at the hotel, he went straight to the Martial Arts Library in the Central State.</p><p></p><p>The Martial Arts Library in the Central State was much larger than the one in Jianghai City.</p><p></p><p>Just the scale of the building was ten times greater, and the cultivation techniques inside were as numerous as the hairs on a cow, countless times more than Jianghai City.</p><p></p><p>But thinking about it, this was after all the central city of the entire Central State, so its various facilities would naturally surpass those of a small city like Jianghai City.</p><p></p><p>"The librarian said that after we return, the library will also be renovated, I wonder if it can reach this level."</p>

        <h1>Chapter 374</h1>
        <div class="content">
            <p>Here is the full English translation of the Chinese excerpt:</p><p></p><p>On Ye Xiao's side, he had already arrived at the old lair of the big fish.</p><p></p><p>It was already empty here, with no one around.</p><p></p><p>The people of the Three Divine Tribes had mobilized to attack the Xuanyuan Ning clan, but ended up being beaten to a miserable state, almost completely wiped out. With great difficulty, one of them managed to escape, only to be extinguished by Ye Xiao.</p><p></p><p>It was truly a tragic situation.</p><p></p><p>"Is this the site where the Divine King's Tomb you mentioned is located?" </p><p></p><p>Ye Xiao looked at the star island that had been split in half, unable to help but fall into deep contemplation.</p><p></p><p>The Divine King's Tomb, buried in such a shabby place? Seeming to have noticed his puzzlement, the big fish spoke again:</p><p></p><p>"Don't underestimate this place. Although it looks very dilapidated, it truly houses the tomb of an ancient Divine King. The reason you can't see it is because it is located in a separate small space, so you are unable to perceive it."</p><p></p><p>"I see."</p><p></p><p>After understanding this, Ye Xiao immediately activated his own eye technique - the Primal Eyes.</p><p></p><p>The Primal Eyes were already powerful enough on their own, and had also awakened the powers of the Ghostly Flame Eyes and the Emerald Gold Eyes, making them even more formidable now.</p><p></p><p>He scanned the area with his Primal Eyes and quickly discovered the entrance to the Divine King's Tomb.</p><p></p><p>It was right in the middle of that place.</p><p></p><p>"I've found it!"</p><p></p><p>A gleam of excitement flashed in Ye Xiao's eyes.</p><p></p><p>In the blink of an eye, he arrived in front of the entrance to the Divine King's Tomb.</p><p></p><p>However, there was a major problem at hand now.</p><p></p><p>How to enter the interior of the Divine King's Tomb.</p><p></p><p>The entrance to the Divine King's Tomb was sealed by a formation. Although breaking it would not be too difficult for Ye Xiao's current level of formation mastery, the issue was that once the formation was broken, it would inevitably trigger celestial anomalies or the leakage of powerful spiritual energy from within the tomb.</p><p></p><p>At that point, he would most likely be exposed.</p><p></p><p>Ye Xiao rubbed his brow.</p><p></p><p>The Yin-Yang Escape Technique could be used to penetrate the formation, but his cultivation was not high enough.</p><p></p><p>Not having enough cultivation naturally meant that he could not fully unleash the power of the Nine Star Divine Technique - Yin-Yang Escape. Without being able to bring the Yin-Yang Escape Technique to its peak, there was no way he could break through the Ninth Star Formation-level seal of the Divine King's Tomb.</p><p></p><p>How should he break through then? "Aha!"</p><p></p><p>Ye Xiao suddenly realized that if he did not completely dismantle the formation, but only opened a small gap in it, then he could use the Yin-Yang Escape Technique.</p><p></p><p>The Yin-Yang Escape Technique did not require one's physical body to be fully manifested in the other place.</p><p></p><p>It only needed a transmission medium. If it was something that the Yin-Yang Escape Technique could transcend, such as an imperfect formation or obstacles like mountains or buildings, it could directly pass through.</p><p></p><p>The reason why the Yin-Yang Escape Technique could not penetrate here was that this formation was set up too perfectly, with divine crystals inside that could fully unleash its effects, making it exceed the level of medium that the Yin-Yang Escape Technique could traverse.</p><p></p><p>In that case, if he could create a small hole, turning the inside into normal air that met the medium requirements for the Yin-Yang Escape Technique to pass through, he would naturally be able to freely shuttle back and forth inside.</p><p></p><p>Thinking of this, he immediately put it into action.</p><p></p><p>With his formation mastery, Ye Xiao quickly expanded a circular opening in the formation.</p><p></p><p>It was like pulling open a hole in a stocking - the gap inside would become larger without damaging the entire formation, without leaking the aura of the Divine King's Tomb, and Ye Xiao could also take the opportunity to enter.</p><p></p><p>"It's done!"</p><p></p><p>Ye Xiao took a deep breath, stored the big fish in his spatial ring, and immediately began to use the Yin-Yang Escape Technique, entering the Divine King's Tomb in the blink of an eye.</p><p></p><p>As soon as he entered, he felt a vast spiritual energy rushing towards him.</p><p></p><p>As the tomb of a Divine King, even though it had fallen from the ancient times, the tomb still contained such powerful spiritual energy, far more abundant than the outside.</p><p></p><p>However, the first thing Ye Xiao needed to do was not to continue exploring deeper, as the cautious person he was. He first wanted to test whether the small hole he had created was usable.</p><p></p><p>Therefore, he used the Yin-Yang Escape Technique again, passing through the hole to the outside and then back in, repeating this several times to ensure that the hole was smooth and he could freely come and go. Only then did he feel assured and proceed to walk deeper into the Divine King's Tomb.</p><p></p><p>As the tomb of a Divine King, it naturally had countless formations and traps.</p><p></p><p>Even a powerful Divine King would fear having their tomb plundered by martial artists after their demise.</p><p></p><p>Unfortunately, there were no divine techniques, so at most they could only use Ninth Star Divine Formations.</p><p></p><p>This was simple child's play for Ye Xiao. Combined with the formations inside the tomb, even if he destroyed them, there were still the outer formations guarding against the leakage of aura, so he could act without any restraint in navigating the formations.</p><p></p><p>One formation, two formations, three formations... In just one hour, Ye Xiao had dismantled all the formations and successfully entered the inner sanctum of the Divine King's Tomb.</p><p></p><p>Upon opening the door to the interior of the Divine King's Tomb, countless divine crystals, divine elixirs, heavenly materials and earthly treasures, as well as fully forged divine weapons and tools were all present in abundance!</p><p></p><p>It was a veritable treasure trove.</p><p></p><p>Here is the full English translation of the Chinese excerpt:</p><p></p><p>The purpose supermarket still needs to be complete. "Sss~!"</p><p></p><p>Even Ye Xiao, who now possesses over a hundred billion spirit crystals, couldn't help but take a deep breath and feel extremely shocked after seeing this scene.</p><p></p><p>"Is this the legendary treasure trove of the God King?"</p><p></p><p>Ye Xiao sighed, walked straight up, picked up a bottle of divine elixir, opened the cap, and poured it into his mouth.</p><p></p><p>As someone who possessed the art of elixir refinement, he could easily taste the exceptional quality of these divine elixirs. Although they were not as good as the divine elixir he had refined with his utmost effort during his breakthrough, the sheer quantity made it a very nutritious meal for Ye Xiao.</p><p></p><p>While eating, he also collected the items from the treasure trove. As a qualified tomb raider, of course, he had to clear it out completely, not leaving a single thing behind.</p><p></p><p>However, the items here were truly too many, and the entire God King's tomb was also very vast. It was not easy for Ye Xiao alone to handle it.</p><p></p><p>Fortunately, he had brought the jade seal with him, which contained Illusion Crystal, Great Emperor Dragon Lion, and a group of little helpers to do the work.</p><p></p><p>Ye Xiao directly released them and said, "Start working! You are responsible for clearing this place out, and I will go see if the tomb owner has left anything good."</p><p></p><p>The Great Emperor Dragon Lion and the others, who had just been released, looked at the countless treasures before them with a dazed expression.</p><p></p><p>"Did the master rob a God King? Otherwise, how could there be so many good things?"</p><p></p><p>"I feel like he dug up a God King's tomb."</p><p></p><p>"Wow, the master is really amazing. He even obtained a God King's tomb."</p><p></p><p>"Stop talking nonsense! Get to work quickly!"</p><p></p><p>"Okay..."</p><p></p><p>The spirit beasts started to work busily.</p><p></p><p>Ye Xiao went straight to the center of the tomb.</p><p></p><p>Here, there was a huge crystal coffin, and inside the crystal coffin lay a female God King with an extremely perfect figure.</p><p></p><p>This crystal coffin seemed to have a preservative effect, and from the ancient times until now, her appearance had not aged at all, still the same as before her demise. Her skin was so tender that it seemed to be able to drip water.</p><p></p><p>"The corpse is preserved so fresh, could it be a zombie transformation?"</p><p></p><p>The existence of a God King-level expert turning into a zombie, the terrifying power of that, Ye Xiao did not dare to imagine.</p><p></p><p>However, after activating his Elemental Eyes and scanning her body, he confirmed that her body had completely perished, and her soul had completely disappeared, so he felt much more at ease.</p><p></p><p>He opened the crystal coffin and took away all the treasures on her body. There were several top-grade divine weapons, as well as some extremely expensive special materials. Even her clothes were woven from the best star beast silkworm silk, and from the ancient times until now, they had not been damaged, most likely from silkworms above the Beast Sovereign level.</p><p></p><p>But adhering to the last shred of human morality, Ye Xiao did not strip her clothes.</p><p></p><p>After collecting the treasures, he snapped his fingers, and a flame fell on the God King's body.</p><p></p><p>"Dust to dust, earth to earth, you have already died, keeping this body will only attract attention, I'll help you, so that later no one will come and do something unclean to you."</p><p></p><p>The God King's body began to burn, and it took a long time.</p><p></p><p>Ye Xiao did not leave, he just waited quietly, scanning the items in the main tomb chamber.</p><p></p><p>He found two small notebooks.</p><p></p><p>When he got the notebooks, Ye Xiao's Golden Book Spiritual Consciousness suddenly jumped.</p><p></p><p>Ye Xiao's mouth curled up in delight.</p><p></p><p>This was a sign that it was about to be completed. Whenever he was missing just one cultivation method, the Golden Book would have a special reaction when he found it.</p><p></p><p>Sure enough, one of the two notebooks contained a healing art called the "Return to Spring of All Things!" It seems that this God King was a healer in her lifetime, no wonder she was able to preserve her body so well, even after so many years, her body was still not decayed.</p><p></p><p>Ye Xiao read through the "Return to Spring of All Things" and recorded it in his Golden Book Spiritual Consciousness, allowing the Golden Book to begin cultivating it, then he continued to look at the second notebook.</p><p></p><p>The second notebook recorded her life story, her name, and the ancient God Realm she belonged to.</p><p></p><p>Indeed, she was one of the God Kings of that ancient God Realm.</p><p></p><p>This notebook detailed the glorious history of that ancient God Realm, as well as its eventual downfall due to offending many other God Realms.</p><p></p><p>At the same time, she had recorded the location of the God Realm's treasure trove in this notebook, and entrusted the person who inherited her legacy to find that God Realm treasure trove and restore the glory of the ancient God Realm.</p><p></p><p>After reading all this, Ye Xiao couldn't help but feel a chill in his heart.</p><p></p><p>Fortunately, he had come and found this God King's tomb, otherwise, if someone else discovered this God King's tomb, it would definitely cause an uproar.</p><p></p><p>If the Ning Family discovered this, and reported it to the XuanYuan Clan, it's possible that the God Kings or even God Emperors of the XuanYuan Clan might come in person.</p><p></p><p>This is the second update, 6,000 words.</p><p></p><p>Please recommend votes and monthly votes.</p><p></p><p>(This chapter is complete)</p>

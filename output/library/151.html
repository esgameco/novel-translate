        <h1>Chapter 151</h1>
        <div class="content">
            <p>Here is the full English translation of the Chinese excerpt:</p><p></p><p>Forget it, it doesn't matter. I'll just break through the innate eighth rank first.</p><p></p><p>When soldiers come, they will be met with generals; when water comes, it will be blocked by earth.</p><p></p><p>If it really wants to strike down, I won't be able to do anything about it anyway.</p><p></p><p>However, Ye Xiao doesn't completely lack vigilance.</p><p></p><p>He is worried that this thunder cloud may strike down when he is in the midst of his breakthrough, so he places the Tang Dao on top of his head, using it as a lightning rod to prevent the thunder cloud from launching a sneak attack without honor.</p><p></p><p>After doing all this, Ye Xiao no longer suppresses the surging qi within his body, allowing it to erupt wildly.</p><p></p><p>At the same time, the cultivation techniques within Ye Xiao's body are continuously running and exploding.</p><p></p><p>At this moment, Ye Xiao discovers that his cultivation techniques have already begun to occupy a certain position within his body, forming one vortex after another.</p><p></p><p>These vortices, each one, are providing Ye Xiao with cultivation states, but the absorption speed will vary depending on the different types of cultivation techniques.</p><p></p><p>Ye Xiao feels that his spiritual power is also constantly rising, entering a more complex and exquisite level.</p><p></p><p>Both spiritual power and physical strength are expanding madly.</p><p></p><p>All the cultivation techniques are striving to break through frantically.</p><p></p><p>The Ziwei Star Sea technique, this mental cultivation method, has the fastest circulation of spiritual energy.</p><p></p><p>Next are the Tyrant Saber, Slash the Heavens Sword, and Tathagata Divine Palm, the three combat-type cultivation techniques.</p><p></p><p>Then there are the Vajra Indestructible Divine Skill, Supplementing the Heavens Art, Chenxing Decree, Extreme Healing Art, and Divine Will Decree, the four auxiliary cultivation techniques.</p><p></p><p>Finally, there are the Demonic Craftsmanship and Myriad Elements Converge, the two pill and weapon forging techniques, as well as the Earthly Fiend Heavenly Talisman Formation and the Heavenly Transformation Creation Formation, the two imperial formations.</p><p></p><p>The Taixuan Heavenly Talisman is also running very fast, but it is a spiritual-type cultivation technique, so Ye Xiao has no way to make a comparison, and naturally cannot determine whether its speed is fast or slow.</p><p></p><p>Looking at it this way, as cultivation level increases, the cultivation speed of various techniques will gradually show differences, and not small ones.</p><p></p><p>Like the main mental cultivation method and combat-type techniques, their improvement speed is the fastest.</p><p></p><p>The auxiliary ones are slightly inferior, and as for pill and weapon forging, and formations, it's not even worth mentioning. Compared to the former, they are almost completely useless, with speeds so slow they can be ignored.</p><p></p><p>Ye Xiao has finally understood one thing: why people mainly cultivate as warriors, and not as pill refiners, weapon forgers, or formation masters.</p><p></p><p>These things, the effort put in is no less than that of combat-type techniques, and some auxiliary techniques may even be more difficult to cultivate and more time-consuming.</p><p></p><p>But the benefits they bring are far less than those of combat techniques and mental cultivation methods.</p><p></p><p>It is true that a formation master of the same level can set up formations that can kill far more combat-type warriors than their own number.</p><p></p><p>But their later-stage cultivation progress is very slow, and they will soon be surpassed by combat-type warriors. At that time, when the two sides clash again, unless they can lure the opponent into the formation, they will inevitably meet a miserable end.</p><p></p><p>Those who can cultivate formations, pill refining, and weapon forging, either have inherited good techniques from their families and have excellent natural talents, or they are simply trash who suck at cultivation.</p><p></p><p>And 99% of pill refiners, formation masters, weapon forgers, beast tamers, puppet masters, poison masters, and mechanical masters, the more obscure warrior paths, don't even need to be mentioned.</p><p></p><p>As long as someone has a bit of talent, who would choose to go down those obscure paths?</p><p></p><p>Ye Xiao also understood another thing.</p><p></p><p>That is, the three divisions of the Divine Sect level.</p><p></p><p>In fact, from the innate sixth rank to the innate seventh rank, the required spiritual energy reserve within the body has already become extremely large, far exceeding the previous few rank increases.</p><p></p><p>And from seventh rank to eighth rank, it is the same, requiring a huge amount of spiritual energy.</p><p></p><p>This easily explains why at the Grand Master level, the focus is on tempering one's heart and mind.</p><p></p><p>It's like building a house, you have to lay a good foundation first, then the rest will be easier to build.</p><p></p><p>Only by properly tempering one's heart and mind can one control the huge spiritual energy required at the Divine Sect level and above.</p><p></p><p>Didn't he just break through the innate seventh rank and then collide with the new experimental aircraft of the American state because he couldn't control his own power?</p><p></p><p>After understanding all this, Ye Xiao's cultivation within his body finally broke through the last barrier.</p><p></p><p>Boom! This time, it was not that fart-like "pop" sound.</p><p></p><p>But a huge rumbling sound in his body, as if a huge bomb had exploded.</p><p></p><p>In an instant, two dazzling rays of light erupted from Ye Xiao's eyes, like lightning.</p><p></p><p>An earth-shattering power was madly expanding within his body.</p><p></p><p>Fierce winds were dispersing, forming a violent rotating aura around his body, completely enveloping him in 360 degrees.</p><p></p><p>The lightning that struck was directly bounced off by the extremely dense spiritual energy, unable to touch Ye Xiao's body at all.</p><p></p><p>"So this is the power of the innate eighth rank?"</p><p></p><p>Ye Xiao clenched his fists, feeling as if he and the surrounding heaven and earth were about to merge as one.</p><p></p><p>He didn't need to look, he could clearly sense everything around him.</p><p></p><p>This was not using spiritual power, but a kind of perception of the surrounding natural environment that had evolved from his cultivation being too powerful.</p><p></p><p>It was a kind of cultivation...</p><p></p><p>Here is the full English translation of the Chinese novel excerpt:</p><p></p><p>After reaching the Innate Eighth Grade, a certain characteristic ability had begun to manifest. At this moment, endless lightning was continuously falling from the sky above, as if it wanted to test Ye Xiao's power.</p><p></p><p>Even though a small portion was absorbed by the Tang Dao above Ye Xiao's head, the vast majority still came from other directions, striking towards Ye Xiao. However, after their numbers and strength increased, they still could not break through the spiritual energy surrounding Ye Xiao and harm him in the slightest.</p><p></p><p>"Shameless."</p><p></p><p>Seeing the lightning that showed no signs of stopping, Ye Xiao felt somewhat impatient.</p><p></p><p>At this rate, he didn't know when it would end.</p><p></p><p>With a slight movement of his fingers, the Tang Dao that was resisting the lightning immediately responded to Ye Xiao's command and returned to his hand.</p><p></p><p>Without the Tang Dao's resistance, the lightning in the sky became even more reckless, madly striking down towards Ye Xiao's head. If it weren't for the rotating spiritual energy that diverted the lightning, Ye Xiao would have been reduced to charcoal.</p><p></p><p>Even so, the lightning that branched out and fell to the ground still caused tremendous bombardment to the surrounding mountains, reducing many plants and small animals to ashes.</p><p></p><p>Ye Xiao gently stroked the Tang Dao and lightly tapped it, causing the sword to emit a hum, as if it was excited and anticipating something.</p><p></p><p>"Since I forged you, I haven't truly used you. Today, I shall unleash you."</p><p></p><p>With these words, the hum of the Tang Dao became even more intense, like an excited child.</p><p></p><p>Ye Xiao's mouth curved upwards, and he raised the Tang Dao high. At this moment, the power of the Innate Eighth Grade was completely concentrated on the Tang Dao, causing it to emanate an extremely strong golden light.</p><p></p><p>In this instant, it was difficult to distinguish whether the Tang Dao was a sword or a blade. In the illusion, it seemed to be an invincible blade, yet also a sword capable of shattering everything.</p><p></p><p>This was Ye Xiao's original intention when he forged the Tang Dao - it could wield both the dao and the sword arts!</p><p></p><p>The surrounding forces seemed to be distorted by it, and the falling lightning could not approach the Tang Dao, as if being held back by an invisible force.</p><p></p><p>"Sever the Heavens!"</p><p></p><p>Uttering these two faint words, Ye Xiao brought the sword down.</p><p></p><p>The sword beam extended for tens of thousands of meters, slicing through the sky! The dark thunder clouds covering the entire mountain range were directly split in half by Ye Xiao's "Sever the Heavens" strike, as if giving the sky a middle part.</p><p></p><p>After this strike, the arrogant dark cloud layer gradually retreated and dissipated into nothingness.</p><p></p><p>Indeed, no matter who it is, you shouldn't give them too much face. The more you give them face, the more arrogant they become. Even the Heavens are the same.</p><p></p><p>At this moment, Ye Xiao sensed several extremely powerful forces rapidly converging in this direction.</p><p></p><p>It seemed that some curious fellows had rushed over.</p><p></p><p>Ye Xiao shook his head, feeling somewhat exasperated by these "paparazzi" of the martial arts world.</p><p></p><p>Subsequently, he activated the Divine Will Technique and shot towards the direction of Jianghai City.</p><p></p><p>Just as he left, several figures quickly arrived at the scene.</p><p></p><p>Gazing at the thunder clouds that had been split in half and were gradually disappearing, they fell into deep contemplation.</p><p></p><p>"So powerful! Who has broken through? They even summoned thunder clouds." </p><p></p><p>"The scale of these thunder clouds hasn't reached the King Realm level, but that's what makes it even more terrifying. It means the person is at the Divine Ancestor Realm, yet they've already summoned divine lightning."</p><p></p><p>"Truly horrifying. Throughout history, those who could summon heavenly lightning at the Divine Ancestor Realm are extremely rare. But each of them has achieved extraordinary accomplishments far beyond ordinary people!"</p><p></p><p>"Your vision is too narrow. Summoning thunder clouds is nothing. Didn't you see how he split those thunder clouds apart? This person has already surpassed the previous great figures in our Nine States. They are stronger than the legendary myths!"</p><p></p><p>"Truly an extraordinary genius. It seems our Nine States will produce another powerful expert."</p><p></p><p>The onlookers discussed animatedly, their eyes filled with both shock and admiration.</p><p></p><p>After all, this was the Nine States. </p><p></p><p>The person was a descendant of the Nine States.</p><p></p><p>That was enough.</p><p></p><p>Meanwhile, in Jianghai City, a mountain that Ye Xiao had previously crashed into while learning the Divine Will Technique was suddenly cleaved in half! This time, the entire mountain was blasted into rubble, unlike the previous occasion when only a large crater was formed at the mountain top.</p><p></p><p>Many sleeping residents of Jianghai City were startled awake by the commotion.</p><p></p><p>"What happened?"</p><p>"Was it an earthquake?"</p><p>"Quick, run!"</p><p>"Ah, you're trapping me, I can't get out! Don't move, my head is stuck inside!"</p>

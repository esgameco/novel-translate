        <h1>Chapter 312</h1>
        <div class="content">
            <p>Here is the full English translation of the Chinese excerpt:</p><p></p><p>Indeed, the other states also have certain defensive works, but if the warriors below do not cooperate, it will be in vain.</p><p></p><p>The screen clearly displays the major cities in the West, which are being ruthlessly crushed by the star beasts, with the concentrated firepower making it impossible to see.</p><p></p><p>One towering skyscraper after another is being mercilessly destroyed, with human warriors and star beasts engaged in a chaotic battle.</p><p></p><p>"I am Lucy, a reporter from the St. Louis station. This is truly a great disaster of the century. The beast calamity has actually arrived, and it is further empowered by the seven-star conjunction. Their numbers are numerous, and their strength is extremely powerful. But I believe that the brave and courageous warriors of the American states will not be defeated..."</p><p></p><p>"Oh, my God, who will come and save us? There are too many star beasts in the Australian states."</p><p></p><p>"The warriors of the Great Yong State, for the honor of the warriors, kill!"</p><p></p><p>This is a scene of the apocalypse, with human warriors dying everywhere, and a large number of humans losing their lives every minute and second.</p><p></p><p>Only the Nine States currently have formations protecting them, able to withstand the impact of the spiritual energy cannons without a single casualty.</p><p></p><p>Dou Changfeng does not know how long the Nine States can hold out. He knows that the Sword Immortal protects the Jianghai City, but the Sword Immortal is not under his command and cannot be commanded by him.</p><p></p><p>Moreover, the Sword Immortal will certainly be used to deal with the high-level combat forces of the enemy, and it is impossible for him to deal with these small fry.</p><p></p><p>Therefore, he must make early preparations to ensure the protection of the people of the Nine States in Jianghai City as much as possible.</p><p></p><p>"Transmit my order, let all human warriors equip their weapons and be on high alert at all times. If the formation is broken, all human warriors must join the battle!"</p><p></p><p>"Yes!"</p><p></p><p>After giving these orders, Dou Changfeng pulled out a case from under his desk, opened it, and inside was a set of master-level quality armor.</p><p></p><p>In this critical moment of life and death for humanity, as the city lord, he must also go to the battlefield and share the fate of the human race.</p><p></p><p>In the starry sky, nearly a thousand huge spiritual energy ships, like meteors, are densely falling down.</p><p></p><p>Among them, the largest spiritual energy ship has several figures of different statures standing tall.</p><p></p><p>There are burly and muscular lion-faced star beast powerhouses over ten meters tall.</p><p></p><p>There are petite and charming mermaid powerhouses only about 1.5 meters tall.</p><p></p><p>There are also slender and skeletal-looking figures.</p><p></p><p>Although each figure looks vastly different, the aura they exude is terrifying, making one's breath catch.</p><p></p><p>The star beasts look down at the human world below, their eyes filled with a chilling coldness and a bloodthirsty killing intent.</p><p></p><p>"This is the main camp of the human race."</p><p></p><p>"After thousands of years, we can finally completely destroy the human race in this world."</p><p></p><p>"This time, with the seven-star conjunction, the strength of our star beast clan has surged. The top eighty powerhouses on the Star Rank have all reached the realm of half-step Transcendent. Excluding the human powerhouses on the list, the star beasts occupy the top sixty positions, all of them above the half-step Transcendent realm.</p><p></p><p>Moreover, several star beasts have directly broken through to the true Transcendent realm with the aid of the seven-star conjunction.</p><p></p><p>Adding to the previous twelve Transcendent ones, there are now more than twenty-one Transcendent star beasts.</p><p></p><p>How can the human race stir up a great wave?"</p><p></p><p>"Be a little more careful, there are still some powerhouses among the human race."</p><p></p><p>"What do we fear? Look at the powerhouses on this ship - Kuang Xinglong, ranked 47th on the Star Rank, Yang Chen, ranked 49th, and the Skeleton Emperor, ranked 53rd. All of them are half-step Transcendent. No matter how strong the human race is, how strong can they be?"</p><p></p><p>"That's right. Moreover, the six Emperor-level powerhouses of the human race are all on the Star Battlefield. Aside from them, there are no other Emperors. I don't know what you're afraid of?"</p><p></p><p>The star beast who had been persuading the others just shook his head slightly.</p><p></p><p>"I'm not quite sure. I just have a vague feeling that something is not quite right. Never mind, perhaps I'm overthinking it."</p><p></p><p>"Don't think about those unnecessary things anymore. The human race is right in front of us. Increase the speed and rush down to occupy the land world, kill all the human race! Extract the divine blood and let us completely ascend to the Transcendent realm!"</p><p></p><p>"Kill!"</p><p></p><p>All the star beasts are excited to the extreme, whether it is the thirst for human blood or the empowerment of the seven-star conjunction, the atmosphere has been heated to the limit.</p><p></p><p>On the ground, the formation above Jianghai City is bearing increasingly fierce attacks.</p><p></p><p>If it were not for the thick spiritual energy continuously being supplied, it would have been shattered long ago.</p><p></p><p>At this moment, the rippling waves of the formation can no longer be seen, only golden light remains.</p><p></p><p>This is because the star beasts' spiritual energy cannon attacks are too concentrated, with no intervals, just continuous attacks, completely obscuring the sight of the sky above.</p><p></p><p>Dou Changfeng is constantly arranging the deployment of warriors in Jianghai City. Once the formation is breached, they will immediately charge out and fight the star beasts to the death.</p><p></p><p>Nearly one-fifth of the population of the Nine States is gathered here, staring intently at the sky.</p><p></p><p>Everyone's heartbeat cannot help but start to rise.</p><p></p><p>Although they cannot see how many star beasts are behind the concentrated bombardment, everyone is aware that the number must far exceed the warriors they have deployed in Jianghai City.</p><p></p><p>And even with the formation to defend, they can vaguely feel the tremendous power behind the formation.</p><p></p><p>Here is the full English translation of the Chinese excerpt:</p><p></p><p>The power of the attack was so formidable!</p><p></p><p>As the attacks became increasingly concentrated, the formation in the sky above Jianghai City began to tremble. At the entrance of the library, Ning Yuhen looked at the formation with a somewhat grave expression and said to the manager, "Manager, this formation cannot withstand such intense and concentrated attacks. It's about to be breached."</p><p></p><p>"I know," Ye Xiao responded calmly.</p><p></p><p>After all, the formation was not divine. That it could withstand such concentrated spiritual energy cannon attacks for so long was already quite remarkable.</p><p></p><p>If it were any other human city without such a formation to defend it, the city would have been destroyed by 70% or more, and the number of cultivators killed or injured would be unimaginable. </p><p></p><p>But here in Jianghai City, where one-fifth of the human race was gathered, not a single person had died yet.</p><p></p><p>That was enough.</p><p></p><p>His perception could already sense the spiritual energy ships of the Star Beasts descending to an altitude of about 10,000 meters, ready to strike.</p><p></p><p>This was also the reason he had deployed powerful experts in every area. Relying solely on the formation to defend would never be enough to easily fend off the Star Beasts.</p><p></p><p>To resolve the crisis, all those Star Beasts had to be slain, only then could the attacks truly cease and the formation continue to be used.</p><p></p><p>Otherwise, the formation would eventually be shattered from enduring the ceaseless bombardment.</p><p></p><p>Taking a deep breath, he walked towards an open space.</p><p></p><p>An endless, razor-sharp sword intent began to emanate from him. With each step Ye Xiao took, the surrounding spiritual energy was sliced apart by an invisible sword intent, unable to coalesce for a long time.</p><p></p><p>Behind him, Ning Yuhen's heart trembled, his gaze more grave than when he had looked at the attacks in the sky.</p><p></p><p>"Is the manager going to act?"</p><p></p><p>He glanced at the nearby Youwei and said, "Youwei, quickly hide behind me. We are too close to the manager. You cannot withstand the aura he is about to unleash."</p><p></p><p>Youwei reacted immediately, moving closer to him. Ning Yuhen directly deployed a defensive barrier to protect her.</p><p></p><p>She looked at the distant figure with some trepidation. </p><p></p><p>She knew Ye Xiao's strength was terrifying, but in the previous battle at Silver Fox Valley, she had only fought against some Grand Ancestor-level Star Beasts on the periphery, so she had not witnessed the horrifying sight of Ye Xiao suppressing several Monarch Realm experts with just his imposing aura before the Imperial Relic.</p><p></p><p>This was the first time she would see Ye Xiao act.</p><p></p><p>At this moment, her heart was pounding violently.</p><p></p><p>How powerful would an Emperor Realm expert be when they acted? She strained her eyes wide open, for this might be the only time in her life she would witness an Emperor Realm expert in action. She wanted to record every moment of this scene.</p><p></p><p>Ye Xiao walked to a hundred paces away from the two of them, each step carefully cultivating his aura and concentrating his power, bringing them to their peak state.</p><p></p><p>Finally, Ye Xiao unleashed his attack.</p><p></p><p>To prevent the formation from being destroyed, Ye Xiao abruptly withdrew the formation in that instant.</p><p></p><p>Without the formation, the overwhelming pressure from the endless attacks directly pressed down on the heads of all the human cultivators in Jianghai City, causing them to feel their breathing constrict, and their bodies unable to move even a inch, as if they had been completely locked down.</p><p></p><p>In fact, it was not only because of the oppressive aura from the endless attacks, but also the fear deeply rooted in their souls and bodies that rendered them immobilized in that moment.</p><p></p><p>No one had expected the formation to be withdrawn, and all eyes were wide open in shock.</p><p></p><p>Had the formation been shattered? Or had the spiritual stones powering the formation run out?</p><p></p><p>Heavens, were they being toyed with? If those attacks landed, how many would be slaughtered in this densely populated area?</p><p></p><p>The cannon fire was extremely fast, and would likely reach the ground in no more than two seconds. Some Patriarch-level cultivators had already begun to instinctively release spiritual energy barriers to protect themselves.</p><p></p><p>However, in the next moment, an unexpected event occurred! From the very center of Jianghai City, at the location of the library, a tremendously powerful and awe-inspiring force suddenly surged upwards.</p><p></p><p>This force, the moment it appeared, instantly neutralized the oppressive aura from the descending bombardment.</p><p></p><p>The people felt the mountain-like pressure weighing down on them suddenly crumble and dissipate.</p><p></p><p>Then, a thunderous sword beam slashed out.</p><p></p><p>The sword beam, the moment it emerged, instantly annihilated all the incoming cannon fire. It soared skyward, unstoppable, destroying everything in its path. In the blink of an eye, it had pierced through and consumed nearly a thousand Star Beast spiritual energy ships.</p><p></p><p>Two updates, six thousand. </p><p></p><p>Seeking recommendations, seeking monthly votes.</p><p></p><p>Thank you to book friends 20181102141555022, book friend San Liu He Jiu, and book friend Departed Youth for the donations, greatly appreciated.</p><p></p><p>(This chapter is complete)</p>

        <h1>Chapter 252</h1>
        <div class="content">
            <p>Here is the full English translation of the Chinese excerpt:</p><p></p><p>Ye Xiao shrugged his shoulders.</p><p></p><p>"There's nothing strange about that, right? I'm not that close to him."</p><p></p><p>Liu Chengxun was somewhat amused and exasperated.</p><p></p><p>Is this a matter of being familiar or not? That person is the idol of countless people!</p><p></p><p>He is a powerful existence that is almost god-like in the eyes of people like them.</p><p></p><p>But thinking about it from another perspective, one can also understand it to some extent.</p><p></p><p>It's just like those idols in Hanzhou, while many people worship them, there are also some who don't care that much.</p><p></p><p>And Ye Xiao's strength is really too weak, he can't possibly understand how powerful the Sword Immortal Li Liushui is.</p><p></p><p>It's like a mountain dweller who has never seen a billionaire - if the other party doesn't truly take out the money and place it in front of him, he won't feel the deep sense of awe.</p><p></p><p>The reason why he feels admiration and shock towards Li Liushui is because he has witnessed the power of Saint Realm experts. Although he has never truly seen the Sword Immortal Li Liushui display his full strength, he has a concept of it in his mind.</p><p></p><p>But Ye Xiao completely lacks this concept.</p><p></p><p>Thinking about this, Liu Chengxun no longer dwelled on it further, and sighed, "It's a pity that he ultimately failed to break through successfully. If he could have broken through, his ranking in the world's strength would have risen even higher, getting closer to the top."</p><p></p><p>"I wonder if he'll have the chance to break through in the future. Breaking through the King Realm is truly too difficult, too difficult."</p><p></p><p>"Mm, it is quite difficult," Ye Xiao recalled his own experience in advancing to the King Realm.</p><p></p><p>He had to find the Refining Soul Technique, gain enlightenment from the Martial Saint Stele, and then hunt the Star Beasts hidden in the Heavenly Devil Cliff. </p><p></p><p>It was only by refining the medicinal pills with the essence of twenty-one Saint Realm Star Beasts that he was finally able to successfully break through to the King Realm.</p><p></p><p>And this didn't even include the Star Beast blood and flesh he had consumed before, and the other abundant sources of vital energy.</p><p></p><p>Breaking through the King Realm truly required much more effort compared to the breakthroughs below the Innate Realm.</p><p></p><p>But when Liu Chengxun heard these words, the corners of his mouth couldn't help but twitch violently.</p><p></p><p>"Quite difficult"? What does "quite" mean? Can this be described with just the word "quite"?</p><p></p><p>Ridiculous, this is something more difficult than ascending to the heavens. </p><p></p><p>Not to mention others, just look at the Sword Immortal Li Liushui - he has heavenly endowed talents, and after centuries of arduous cultivation, he still hasn't broken through to the King Realm, and even went down the path of demonic cultivation.</p><p></p><p>In his lifetime, he doesn't even dare to dream of it.</p><p></p><p>And this is under the assumption that his own aptitude is not bad, and he has the prospect of entering the Ninth Grade Saint Realm.</p><p></p><p>Even if he can confidently enter the Ninth Grade Saint Realm, he still doesn't dare to say he will definitely be able to break through the King Realm in the future.</p><p></p><p>How many people in the entire world can break through the King Realm? At most, it's just a handful, no more than ten or eleven people.</p><p></p><p>And you say it's "quite difficult"? </p><p></p><p>I don't know if you are too naive or too innocent.</p><p></p><p>But thinking about Ye Xiao's strength, Liu Chengxun no longer dwelled on it.</p><p></p><p>Ah, in the end, his strength is just too weak, his knowledge too shallow.</p><p></p><p>If he were at least a Patriarch, he wouldn't have uttered such shallow words! It's not that he looks down on Ye Xiao, after all, they are friends.</p><p></p><p>But some realistic issues still need to be objectively viewed.</p><p></p><p>It's not like Ye Xiao's strength is lacking, and he has to convince himself that he's capable, that would be too self-deceptive and burying one's head in the sand.</p><p></p><p>"Anyway, since Li Liushui has come to find Senior Sword Immortal, I wonder what level of cultivation Senior Sword Immortal has. With his cultivation, he should still have a good chance of advancing to the King Realm."</p><p></p><p>Liu Chengxun clenched his fists.</p><p></p><p>"Ye Xiao, in this lifetime, I must find Senior Sword Immortal."</p><p></p><p>"Mm, mm, can you give me some free time now? I want to read a book."</p><p></p><p>Liu Chengxun shook his head.</p><p></p><p>"Ye Xiao, you should set a goal for yourself. </p><p></p><p>A too carefree life without any goals is not perfect.</p><p></p><p>As for me, my lifetime goal is to advance to the peak of the Ninth Grade Saint Realm.</p><p></p><p>Although your aptitude is not good enough, you should at least set a goal of becoming a First Grade Patriarch.</p><p></p><p>Just reading books all day, how can that work?"</p><p></p><p>After saying this, Liu Chengxun turned and left.</p><p></p><p>Two minutes later, Ye Xiao closed the book and let out a muffled breath.</p><p></p><p>He had finally gathered all the materials to construct the Emperor Formation - the Vast Heaven Grand Formation! Ye Xiao wanted to upgrade his cultivation farm, and the formation set up by Senior Monk Guangliang of Shaolin before was definitely not enough.</p><p></p><p>That formation could only be considered a Patriarch-grade supreme formation, and not an Emperor Formation!</p><p></p><p>This was also limited by the overall formation cultivation level in the Nine Provinces.</p><p></p><p>Additionally, there was another point - the development restrictions of the Nine Provinces Alliance.</p><p></p><p>At that time, they did not treat Jianghai City as a key city to cultivate, but merely as a third-tier city.</p><p></p><p>So the formations they set up back then had limited power.</p><p></p><p>Based on this,</p><p></p><p>Here is the full English translation of the Chinese excerpt:</p><p></p><p>It is necessary to rely on oneself to arrange the formation.</p><p></p><p>Fortunately, the types of formations are not as numerous as martial arts techniques, so it is a relatively niche category. Therefore, not too many books are needed to refine an imperial formation.</p><p></p><p>This is not something that Ye Xiao used the Golden Book Spiritual Consciousness to refine, because the Golden Book Spiritual Consciousness has already recorded one formation, and it has reached its limit, unable to randomly acquire basic formations.</p><p></p><p>Now, if Ye Xiao wants to refine imperial techniques or imperial formation techniques, he needs to use the Taixuan Tiangong and gradually explore and evolve them.</p><p></p><p>Unfortunately, he didn't realize before that a small part of the imperial techniques can be extracted from the grandmaster-level techniques, and then fused into true imperial techniques! Otherwise, he would already have so many imperial techniques.</p><p></p><p>After obtaining this formation, Ye Xiao directly recorded it into his spiritual consciousness, allowing the spiritual consciousness to become familiar with it and easily deploy it.</p><p></p><p>By the time he got off work in the evening, a complete imperial formation had been assembled.</p><p></p><p>Ye Xiao originally thought that after assembling three imperial formations, he would be able to synthesize a new formation.</p><p></p><p>However, to his surprise, although the three formations appeared, the pages recording them in the Golden Book did not release any golden light, which meant they could not be combined. Perhaps formations and techniques are somewhat different, so the conditions for synthesis may be higher.</p><p></p><p>But it doesn't matter, the imperial formation is already capable of dealing with existences below the Imperial Realm, which is enough for his current needs.</p><p></p><p>Fortunately, Ye Xiao still has a large amount of resources he seized from the Beast God Alliance, which can be put to use.</p><p></p><p>So after getting off work, Ye Xiao directly used the Earth Escape Technique to enter the underground and began the expansion project of the formation.</p><p></p><p>This time, Ye Xiao plans to create more space.</p><p></p><p>Because as the star beasts become more and more numerous, the original space will definitely not be enough.</p><p></p><p>And with the imperial formation, he is not afraid of the collapse of space.</p><p></p><p>On Ye Xiao's side, the deployment progressed quickly.</p><p></p><p>On the other hand, Chen Qingxuan and the others have finally deployed a brand new formation around the outskirts of Jianghai City.</p><p></p><p>"Phew!" Chen Qingxuan exhaled a mouthful of turbid air, his face revealing a hint of joy at the completion of the work.</p><p></p><p>"As expected, we have finally completed the entire formation of Jianghai City."</p><p></p><p>Several people including Dou Changfeng came forward and thanked Chen Qingxuan.</p><p></p><p>"Old Chen, thank you so much. This time, it took you a full month to replace all the formations inside and outside Jianghai City, and even specially set up a complete defensive formation for Jianghai City."</p><p></p><p>"Don't be so polite, who are we to each other? Back in the days at the Jingzhou Martial Arts University, we were roommates, and we've been good friends for so many years.</p><p></p><p>Now that you are the city lord, I have to bring out my own expertise to give you a boost."</p><p></p><p>Chen Qingxuan's disciple spoke up:</p><p></p><p>"City Lord, my teacher really poured his heart and soul into this! The formations he has done in other cities, although also very good, are far inferior compared to the formations of Jianghai City.</p><p></p><p>Just take the Qi Gathering Formation here, for example. Although it looks like a simple combination of eight grandmaster-level formations placed in the four directions of the city, connected to the central formation of the city, it is actually not weaker than a typical imperial Qi Gathering Formation in terms of difficulty of deployment.</p><p></p><p>Similarly, its effect is no weaker than those ordinary imperial Qi Gathering Formations, but rather stronger!</p><p></p><p>If it were other cities, even a large city, my teacher would only use one imperial formation to handle it.</p><p></p><p>But for this city, he specially spent a lot of time to deploy this technique!"</p><p></p><p>"Little Wang, you talk too much." Chen Qingxuan glared at his disciple, who immediately fell silent, while Dou Changfeng patted Chen Qingxuan's shoulder.</p><p></p><p>"Old Chen, I've noted this kindness. Whenever you need me, just say the word.</p><p></p><p>Anything I can do, I will not refuse."</p><p></p><p>"What's with the formalities? We're brothers, no need for that. I'd better hurry up and put in the spirit stones to test how this formation works!"</p><p></p><p>"Okay!"</p><p></p><p>Dou Changfeng stepped back to make space for Chen Qingxuan, who immediately began to put in the spirit stones.</p><p></p><p>Among these formations, he had already placed the cores of nine pre-Heaven seventh-grade spirit beast stars, placed at the formation's eye points, to enhance the quality of the formation.</p><p></p><p>As soon as the spirit stones were inserted, the entire formation was activated, and the next moment, a torrential surge of spiritual energy began to frantically gather towards Jianghai City.</p><p></p><p>Whoosh, whoosh, whoosh!</p><p></p><p>Standing next to the formation, Dou Changfeng could even hear the frantic howling of the spiritual energy.</p><p></p><p>"Whew! This formation is too powerful!"</p><p></p><p>It is far stronger than the formation previously set up by Guangliang.</p><p></p><p>However, at this moment, a layer of thunderclouds suddenly gathered in the sky above.</p><p></p><p>The crowd couldn't help but frown.</p><p></p><p>"Strange, why did it suddenly start thundering? The weather forecast didn't say it would rain today?"</p>

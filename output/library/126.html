        <h1>Chapter 126</h1>
        <div class="content">
            <p>Here is the full English translation of the Chinese excerpt:</p><p></p><p>This is no laughing matter. If that storage ring truly contains the transmission array of the star beasts, it could potentially deal a devastating blow to the entire Jianghai City!</p><p></p><p>The death toll would be conservatively estimated to be in the tens of thousands.</p><p></p><p>This absolutely cannot be allowed to happen.</p><p></p><p>Since Ma Chunheng is a well-known local entrepreneur, the City Lord's Manor easily obtained his contact information.</p><p></p><p>"Hello! Ma Chunheng, this is Du Tianyu. Where is the storage ring you bought?"</p><p></p><p>"Ah, Your Excellency the City Lord, why are you calling me so late at night?"</p><p></p><p>"Enough nonsense, just tell me where your storage ring is right now!"</p><p></p><p>"Ah, I just lost my storage ring."</p><p></p><p>"Lost it? How could you lose it? Where did you misplace it?"</p><p></p><p>A distressed voice came from the other end of the phone.</p><p></p><p>"I didn't mean to lose it. I even specially got an insurance vault worth over a hundred million to lock the item inside. I wanted to bring it with me and hide it in the company when the Seven Stars Converge arrived.</p><p></p><p>But to my surprise, when I opened the vault this afternoon, it was gone."</p><p></p><p>"You can't accomplish anything, but you sure know how to mess things up!"</p><p></p><p>Du Tianyu angrily hung up the phone, then came before several grand masters with a grave expression.</p><p></p><p>"Ma Chunheng's ring has been lost, and we don't know who stole it."</p><p></p><p>"What? This is unacceptable!"</p><p></p><p>"Quickly, send people to search for it!"</p><p></p><p>Qin Shenglong, Ouyang Yunzhong, and Nangong Ling were all in a panic, but before they could set out, Du Changfeng spoke up.</p><p></p><p>"There's no need to search."</p><p></p><p>The others looked at him with puzzlement.</p><p></p><p>"Elder Du, what do you mean?"</p><p></p><p>Du Changfeng clasped his hands behind his back and gazed towards the distant sword lights in the suburbs, smiling faintly.</p><p></p><p>"Don't you all find it rather coincidental that the swordsman senior has suddenly taken action at this time?"</p><p></p><p>The group was startled, their pupils suddenly constricting.</p><p></p><p>Ah, yes, why would the sword dao expert suddenly act at this moment? And who could have silently taken the storage ring that Ma Chunheng had locked in the vault?</p><p></p><p>"It turns out the swordsman senior knew about the storage ring even earlier than us, and has intercepted it alone."</p><p></p><p>"How ashamed we are! We only realized it now. Senior, you truly deserve the title of senior."</p><p></p><p>In the eyes of Nangong Ling and the others, there was an undisguised admiration and reverence for Ye Xiao.</p><p></p><p>To be so powerful, he was practically divine!</p><p></p><p>In the suburbs, Ye Xiao condensed nearly a thousand sword beams, then pushed them all into the transmission array.</p><p></p><p>The transmission array was bidirectional, allowing star beasts to use it to teleport in, and naturally allowing Ye Xiao to use it to teleport out as well.</p><p></p><p>After the sword beams were unleashed, Ye Xiao stepped into the array.</p><p></p><p>At the same time, in the great ravine, under the command of the various squad leaders, wave after wave of star beast troops crossed into the transmission arrays leading to different cities.</p><p></p><p>Lingnan, Wanghai, Jiangxia... Every city was being flooded with tens of thousands of star beasts.</p><p></p><p>The Holy Emissary stood proudly in midair, watching the star beasts march on one after another, his eyes filled with excitement.</p><p></p><p>"My kin, the time has come for the human race to feel the terror of being ruled by us star beasts!</p><p></p><p>Fight for the rise of the star beasts, and crush the human race!"</p><p></p><p>"Crush the human race!"</p><p>"Crush the human race!"</p><p></p><p>The star beasts shouted excitedly and frenziedly. They had been waiting for this day for over fifty years! During that time, they had been quietly accumulating their strength, all for the purpose of overwhelming humanity today. This was the plan laid out by the powerful ones among the star beasts during the previous beast calamity.</p><p></p><p>Their goal was to completely subjugate and rule over the human race on this planet.</p><p></p><p>"Report to the Holy Emissary, the star beast legion of Wanghai City has completed the teleportation!"</p><p></p><p>"Report to the Holy Emissary, the star beast legion of Lingnan City has completed the teleportation!"</p><p></p><p>"Report to the Holy Emissary, the star beast legion of Jiangdong City has completed the teleportation!"</p><p></p><p>One excited voice after another rang out, and the Holy Emissary nodded in satisfaction.</p><p></p><p>"Next, Jianghai City! Begin the teleportation!"</p><p></p><p>"Yes!"</p><p></p><p>"The star beast legion heading to Jianghai City, prepare to enter the transmission array! Begin the teleportation."</p><p></p><p>"Roarâ€”!"</p><p></p><p>Many star beasts, not yet able to speak human language, could only express their excitement and thirst for blood with furious roars.</p><p></p><p>Soon, the first wave of five thousand star beasts heading to Jianghai City stepped into the transmission array.</p><p></p><p>The array was activated, and a gust of air from the human city, not as pure, swept over them.</p><p></p><p>But just as the transmission array was opening, an extremely sharp and piercing sound suddenly rang out.</p><p></p><p>The star beasts couldn't help but look puzzled.</p><p></p><p>The Star Beast Holy Emissary and the other high-ranking members also revealed expressions of astonishment.</p><p></p><p>"That sound is...?"</p><p></p><p>Only Huanliuli, bound to the flagpole, suddenly had a gleam in her eyes, her tears of excitement welling up.</p><p></p><p>"Hahaha! It's him, it's him! My master has come!</p><p></p><p>Your doom has arrived!"</p><p></p><p>In the next moment, the transmission array beneath the thousands of star beasts suddenly lit up.</p><p></p><p>Dazzling light beams erupted from under the star beasts' feet, with overwhelming power instantly blasting many of them to pieces.</p><p></p><p>Here is the full English translation of the Chinese excerpt:</p><p></p><p>The fragments were shattered. <div class="contentadv"><script>loadAdv(7,3);</script></div>But this was just the beginning. Immediately afterwards, a series of golden sword beams containing immense power erupted from the ground, slamming into the cliffs on both sides of the ravine.</p><p></p><p>Boom, boom, boom...</p><p></p><p>The sword light moved at an extremely fast speed, creating thunderous electric arcs from the friction with the air.</p><p></p><p>In this moment, explosive sounds, sword light, and various colored electric arcs were erupting crazily throughout the ravine.</p><p></p><p>The sheer power even caused the shattered boulders to be instantly pulverized into powder.</p><p></p><p>This was like the end of the world! The star beasts were terrified and fled in panic.</p><p></p><p>"Help!"</p><p>"Run!"</p><p>"Quick, protect the Saint Envoy!"</p><p></p><p>Several Patriarch-level star beasts rushed forward to shield the Saint Envoy behind them.</p><p></p><p>Until the end, the ravine of the "last inch of sky" had been blasted into a gaping hole thousands of meters wide. The sword beams had not stopped, still erupting ceaselessly and shooting towards the sky, carrying the billowing smoke away.</p><p></p><p>The sword beams shot up like rockets, one after another, endlessly into the sky, as if playing an earth-shattering manual game!</p><p></p><p>One second, two seconds, ten seconds... Until a hundred seconds had passed, the ravine finally fell silent.</p><p></p><p>The smoke had all been blown away, and if not for the starlight shining down from above and the clear starry sky revealed by the dispersed clouds, the star beasts would not have dared to imagine the devastating strike this place had just endured.</p><p></p><p>"How... how is this possible?" </p><p></p><p>The high-ranking star beasts in front of the Saint Envoy stared at the ravine in disbelief, their minds completely shattered.</p><p></p><p>The power of the opponent had simply shattered their worldview.</p><p></p><p>This could not have been the work of a group of people - each sword beam's power was terrifyingly strong, and they were all exactly equal in might.</p><p></p><p>The human race could not possibly have so many powerful experts who could simultaneously unleash such identical sword beams.</p><p></p><p>But if all these powerful attacks came from a single person, how strong would that person be?</p><p></p><p>The Saint Envoy narrowed his eyes, staring intently at the teleportation array.</p><p></p><p>He had just heard Illusion Jade's words - the newcomer was Illusion Jade's master?</p><p></p><p>Previously, he had thought Illusion Jade's master would be at most a Patriarch.</p><p></p><p>After all, human Beastmasters could only control star beasts stronger than themselves, otherwise there would be no need to be Beastmasters.</p><p></p><p>But he never expected the opponent to be this powerful! </p><p></p><p>Judging from this strength, the opponent might have already surpassed the Great Patriarch realm!</p><p></p><p>Soon, a young figure dressed in black pants and a black jacket slowly emerged from the teleportation array.</p><p></p><p>All the star beasts were thrown into a state of confusion.</p><p></p><p>He was so young?</p><p></p><p>How was this possible?</p><p></p><p>Even the immortal cultivators of the Divine Sect, who had the art of youthful preservation, would appear to be in their fifties or sixties at the youngest.</p><p></p><p>But this person, he only looked around twenty years old, far too young.</p><p></p><p>How old could he be to possess such tremendous power? Could it be that the human race had produced another genius of the era?</p><p></p><p>Seeing him, Illusion Jade couldn't help but excitedly shout, "Master, I'm here, I'm here!"</p><p></p><p>Hearing the voice, Ye Xiao looked up, his face twitching involuntarily.</p><p></p><p>This plot didn't seem quite right.</p><p></p><p>According to the movie tropes, shouldn't she have become the heroic and capable leader of the star beasts, ignoring him?</p><p></p><p>How could she be tied up on a flagpole and beaten to the point of almost not recognizing her own master? Was she really this embarrassing?</p><p></p><p>"So you are her master?"</p><p></p><p>A voice from not far away drew Ye Xiao's gaze.</p><p></p><p>He swept a glance at the speaker.</p><p></p><p>Just with that one look, he could tell that the other was the Saint Envoy mentioned by Illusion Jade.</p><p></p><p>Because his cultivation was at the innate fifth rank.</p><p></p><p>Capture the leader to catch the thieves.</p><p></p><p>With a thought, five blade beams shot out, targeting the five Patriarch-level star beasts in front of the Saint Envoy.</p><p></p><p>"No, quick-"</p><p></p><p>Before the 'retreat' could be spoken, the next moment, the five Patriarch-level star beasts had been instantly slaughtered, split in half!</p><p></p><p>Boom! The blade beams continued unabated, slamming into the stone wall behind the Saint Envoy, blasting out five deep gashes and kicking up a cloud of dust.</p><p></p><p>"Gulp."</p><p></p><p>The Saint Envoy swallowed hard.</p><p></p><p>Ye Xiao was very strong! Strong enough to make even this Saint Envoy star beast tremble in fear.</p><p></p><p>When had the human race produced another such powerful expert? How had he never heard of this before?</p><p></p><p>"Saint Envoy!"</p><p></p><p>"Human, how dare you!"</p><p></p><p>"Roar!"</p><p></p><p>Throughout the ravine, the other star beasts let out furious roars.</p><p></p><p>The Saint Envoy was their commander, and Ye Xiao's attack on the Saint Envoy had crossed their bottom line.</p><p></p><p>Even if they knew they were no match, they could not allow Ye Xiao to harm their Saint Envoy! The roars of the star beasts echoed through the ravine, ear-piercingly loud, making one's eardrums throb in pain.</p>

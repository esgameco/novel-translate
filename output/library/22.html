        <h1>Chapter 22</h1>
        <div class="content">
            <p>Here is the full English translation of the Chinese novel excerpt:</p><p></p><p>In the first-class cabin of the airplane, there were two figures, one old and one young.</p><p></p><p>The middle-aged man's eyes revealed a hint of self-satisfaction as he hummed a popular tune from the Hanzhou region.</p><p></p><p>The young man quietly looked out at the starry sky.</p><p></p><p>"Jiansheng, this time you've done very well. Jingzhou is the capital of the Nine Provinces, and the martial arts genius of Jingzhou has all been conquered by you. This is a great start.</p><p></p><p>If you can sweep through the remaining eight provinces, your name will resound throughout the world! Then the prestige of our Hanzhou will rise to a whole new level!"</p><p></p><p>The young man's expression remained calm, showing no waves of emotion.</p><p></p><p>"Captain Jin is overthinking things. The vast Nine Provinces have produced many talents over the 5,000 years of civilization, with the torch of tradition being passed down. How can they be underestimated?</p><p></p><p>Just take those few from Jingzhou, for example. They all comprehended the sword arts through books and self-study, without any teacher. </p><p></p><p>Yet their sword skills have already posed a threat to me.</p><p></p><p>If they had a master to guide them, like I do, we might have already been kneeling in Jingzhou."</p><p></p><p>A trace of displeasure flashed across Captain Jin's face.</p><p></p><p>"Jiansheng, you overestimate the Nine Provinces too much.</p><p></p><p>I admit that the Nine Provinces indeed have 5,000 years of civilization and have produced many talents. But don't forget that in the past two hundred years, the Nine Provinces have suffered large-scale attacks from star beasts orchestrated by the other provinces. As a result, many martial arts traditions have been severed and lost their lineage.</p><p></p><p>Although the Nine Provinces have been actively recovering their strength in recent decades, the trauma of two hundred years cannot be repaired overnight.</p><p></p><p>In a sword competition, it's about skills and sword intent, not cultivation! You were taught by the Sword Saint of our great Hanzhou, Liu Chengxun, whose sword arts have already reached a sublime level.</p><p></p><p>You will undoubtedly be able to display the might of our nation!</p><p></p><p>The next stop is Jianghai City in Zhongzhou. This is the first station in Zhongzhou. You should rest well, focus your mind, and in three days, let the entire Zhongzhou tremble at the mere mention of your name!"</p><p></p><p>Pao Jiansheng slowly closed his eyes.</p><p></p><p>Display the might of the nation? Hanzhou is just a tiny place, while the cultural and historical heritage all originates from the Nine Provinces. </p><p></p><p>Now it has even fallen under the control of the Meizhouan. What national prestige is there left?</p><p></p><p>He had no interest whatsoever in this so-called national prestige.</p><p></p><p>He only wanted to find a true strong master to improve his own sword skills!</p><p></p><p>The night passed in a flash.</p><p></p><p>Soon, it was time to start the next day's work.</p><p></p><p>"Two bean buns, two red bean buns, one beef bun, and one soy milk, that's a total of eight. Why did you give me ten?"</p><p></p><p>"Yesterday you took an extra beef bun without paying."</p><p></p><p>"The young man is so honest, I didn't even realize it."</p><p></p><p>Ye Xiao smiled, not daring to say anything.</p><p></p><p>Because that beef bun was stolen by Huanliu.</p><p></p><p>Just as he was about to leave, a loud explosion reached his ears, followed by screams.</p><p></p><p>"There's been a car accident, someone's dead!"</p><p></p><p>The auntie at the breakfast shop frowned, while packing up the buns, grumbling unhappily, "Again! There's an incident every day, it's really cursed."</p><p></p><p>Ye Xiao asked in confusion, "Are there frequent car accidents here?"</p><p></p><p>"Of course! At least two times a week, it's really strange. Exorcists have come, but they can't detect anything. They try setting up stone lions or wooden stakes, but nothing seems to work. Instead, the number of deaths keeps increasing. </p><p></p><p>Before, it was just ordinary people dying, but in the past two years, even martial artists with spiritual powers have started dying."</p><p></p><p>Ye Xiao glanced at the roundabout in the distance, his brow furrowing slightly.</p><p></p><p>As a master, he could see spiritual beings, even though ordinary cultivators could not. </p><p></p><p>There was clearly an evil ghost sitting on the golden bronze ox in the flower bed, devouring the soul of the person who had just died in the car accident.</p><p></p><p>This evil ghost must have cultivated for a long time, with formidable spiritual power.</p><p></p><p>Here is the full English translation of the Chinese excerpt:</p><p></p><p>It's not worth mentioning, but the spiritual energy gathered around him is also extremely powerful. It is roughly equivalent to the strength of a post-celestial ninth-grade martial artist.</p><p></p><p>However, since he is a spiritual being, even if one hasn't cultivated their spiritual power, a pre-celestial master may not necessarily be his opponent.</p><p></p><p>He carried the steamed buns and soy milk and slowly walked over.</p><p></p><p>The illusory Liuli, who was holding the large beef package that Ye Xiao had just bought, couldn't help but speak up:</p><p></p><p>"Master, why do you still give her money? Your family stole things yesterday, and she didn't see it, so she won't bother you."</p><p></p><p>"Because I'm human, I'm just doing what a human should do."</p><p></p><p>"What's the difference? Humans are born from their mothers, and spirit beasts are born from their mothers, they're all born from mothers!"</p><p></p><p>Liuli rolled her eyes, she found it very difficult to understand Ye Xiao's way of thinking.</p><p></p><p>In the world of spirit beasts, the strong are respected, and the weak are prey to the strong.</p><p></p><p>The weak are only fit to be trampled underfoot by the strong! Ye Xiao didn't explain much to her.</p><p></p><p>Humans have humanity! This is the biggest difference between humans and spirit beasts.</p><p></p><p>At this moment, he walked while staring fixedly at the evil ghost, his gaze calm and revealing no trace of thought.</p><p></p><p>The evil ghost was sitting on a golden copper ox, devouring a soul, the soul's expression twisted in agony.</p><p></p><p>But he wouldn't let the other party go because of this, instead, the more the other party struggled, the more excited he became.</p><p></p><p>The evil ghost and the soul are both things that normal people cannot see.</p><p></p><p>The evil ghost was devouring the soul while admiring his "masterpiece", and his eyes revealed a greedy look as he watched the crowd gathered around the car accident.</p><p></p><p>It was obvious that his appetite was not small, and his target was not just this one soul, but the souls of other people as well.</p><p></p><p>"After I devour a thousand souls, I can condense my soul body into a substantial form. </p><p></p><p>At that time, with the control of spiritual energy, the two combined, I may even directly step into the Great Sect and become a Great Sect-level expert! That way, I will be equivalent to a resurrection and rebirth, and I can break free from the shackles of the corpse and completely leave this place, becoming a free being!"</p><p></p><p>But at this moment, his gaze suddenly noticed Ye Xiao.</p><p></p><p>In the moment their eyes met, his expression couldn't help but change.</p><p></p><p>He was discovered? </p><p></p><p>Well, this young man looks young, but he seems to have some abilities!</p><p></p><p>No, since he has seen me, I can't let him leave, otherwise, if I'm exposed and a Great Sect master or a Sect master-level exorcist comes, I'll be done for.</p><p></p><p>Thinking of this, he immediately threw down the soul he had just bitten off an arm and rushed towards Ye Xiao.</p><p></p><p>In an instant, the electromagnetic field on the entire street was interfered with, the traffic lights and street lamps flashed rapidly, cars honked their horns, a cloud covered the dazzling sun, and a cold wind blew, causing everyone to involuntarily shrink their necks.</p><p></p><p>The evil ghost moved at an incredible speed, like a black lightning bolt, and in the blink of an eye, he was in front of Ye Xiao.</p><p></p><p>His ugly face became even more terrifying as he opened his bloody mouth and grinned.</p><p></p><p>It was not only because of killing Ye Xiao to prevent his secret from being exposed, but also because the stronger the person, the stronger their soul power!</p><p></p><p>A great supplement!</p><p></p><p>Of course, he didn't think Ye Xiao was that strong.</p><p></p><p>What danger could a 20-year-old young man pose?</p><p></p><p>"Die!"</p><p></p><p>This is the end of the first update.

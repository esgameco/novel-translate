        <h1>Chapter 191</h1>
        <div class="content">
            <p>Here is the full English translation of the Chinese excerpt:</p><p></p><p>Moyu tossed out a roulette wheel, infusing it with spiritual energy. In the next moment, the roulette wheel transformed into a golden ring of light in the sky.</p><p></p><p>Within that ring of light, it was unclear where it led, but from the back of the ring, one could faintly hear some awe-inspiring roars.</p><p></p><p>Qin Yuyan's face was filled with despair.</p><p></p><p>Although she had never seen a teleportation formation before, she had heard of the power of teleportation formations.</p><p></p><p>That was a power that had mastered the laws of space and time, able to instantly transport warriors over great distances.</p><p></p><p>Each state had only a few such teleportation formations, no more than a handful even in the Nine Realms.</p><p></p><p>These formations were rarely activated, except for transporting large numbers of warriors to reinforce the stellar battlefields. Their preciousness and power were unimaginable.</p><p></p><p>If she were to pass through this teleportation formation, there was a 99% chance she would never be able to return to the human world.</p><p></p><p>According to these star beasts, they were most likely going to offer her up to an even more powerful beast clan expert. If her bloodline and fortune were devoured by the other party, it could create an exceptionally powerful star beast expert! That would be a disaster for humanity.</p><p></p><p>She could not do this! Absolutely not!</p><p></p><p>Although she was now very weak, just an ant, she still had the ability to do something for the Nine Realms and for humanity.</p><p></p><p>While the two star beasts were activating the teleportation formation and not paying attention to her, Qin Yuyan suddenly erupted with spiritual energy, condensing it in her palm, turning her hand into a blade and piercing her own heart.</p><p></p><p>"Pu chi!"</p><p></p><p>The star beast expert Sushan, who was holding her, saw this scene and her expression changed drastically.</p><p></p><p>"Damn it! She actually wants to commit suicide!"</p><p></p><p>She immediately pulled Qin Yuyan's hand out.</p><p></p><p>"Moyu, quickly cast a healing spell, we absolutely cannot let this human girl die. If the imperial bloodline dies, it will be worthless without the human fortune to support it."</p><p></p><p>Moyu immediately stepped forward, preparing to cast a healing spell on Qin Yuyan.</p><p></p><p>But at that moment, her gaze suddenly spotted a streak of light rapidly rising from below, causing her entire body to break out in a cold sweat.</p><p></p><p>"Such a fast speed! It's a human expert catching up!"</p><p></p><p>Sushan's expression turned cold.</p><p></p><p>"So Tieniu failed? Humans are quite stubborn. But even if he comes, it's still death!"</p><p></p><p>She threw Qin Yuyan to Moyu to heal, and fully unleashed her techniques, instantly forming hundreds of sword beams around her, illuminating the entire night sky.</p><p></p><p>"Imperial Extreme Sword Art! Kill!"</p><p></p><p>After the order was given, the thousands of sword beams behind her simultaneously descended, with unstoppable force, charging straight towards Ye Xiao.</p><p></p><p>Ye Xiao was not flustered at all. With a thought, he activated the Slashing Heaven Sword, a sword light radiating thousands of feet, shooting straight towards the sky, colliding with the Imperial Extreme Sword Art in an instant.</p><p></p><p>Boom, boom, boom. The explosions and resulting flames filled the sky, making the dark night even brighter. The explosive flames were mixed with smoke and occasional lightning, forming a giant thundercloud over tens of thousands of feet in diameter.</p><p></p><p>Sushan's Imperial Extreme Sword Art continued to rain down endlessly within it. If Ye Xiao were to enter, he would undoubtedly be struck by the sword beams, either killed or severely injured.</p><p></p><p>Sushan's mouth curled up in a smile, seemingly proud of her own strength.</p><p></p><p>But before she could rejoice, she heard her companion Moyu's scream.</p><p></p><p>"Sushan, behind you!"</p><p></p><p>Sushan's entire body broke out in cold sweat. When did he get behind her?</p><p></p><p>Her movement speed was already monstrous, ranking among the top in the Tiger Spirit Seat experts. Rarely did anyone pose a threat to her.</p><p></p><p>But now, she had actually encountered an existence in the human realm that could instantly surpass her.</p><p></p><p>This was simply unbelievable to her! But she dared not hesitate for a moment, immediately concentrating all her power and activating her movement technique, trying to escape her current position to avoid Ye Xiao's attack.</p><p></p><p>But just as she was about to move, a force of utmost strength and compression instantly pierced through her chest.</p><p></p><p>Sushan could even see the fresh blood spurting out from her chest, scattering in the air like flowers.</p><p></p><p>Infinite Calamity Finger! </p><p></p><p>This move was nearly invincible, able to break through any defense. It had a highly concentrated spiritual energy force that exploded in an instant, fast and devastating. Compared to Ye Xiao's other techniques, it was like a handgun.</p><p></p><p>At close range and within the same realm, no one could evade it.</p><p></p><p>With one Infinite Calamity Finger strike, Sushan's body was pierced through, even her spine broken, leaving her completely defenseless.</p><p></p><p>But this was Ye Xiao's first time using the Infinite Calamity Finger, and he seemed a bit addicted, adding six more fingers!</p><p></p><p>A man remains a youth until death! Boom! Boom! Boom! Boom! Boom! Boom! Two fingers severed her shoulders, two fingers severed her legs, one finger severed her neck, and the last finger pierced her head!</p><p></p><p>After the six fingers, Sushan's entire body went completely limp.</p><p></p><p>The entire process took less than a second.</p><p></p><p>Annihilation! </p><p></p><p>A thorough, undisputed, and crushing annihilation.</p><p></p><p>Ye Xiao directly stored her in his spatial storage ring, then turned his gaze to the last figure, Moyu.</p><p></p><p>Moyu shuddered and immediately turned to run!</p><p></p><p>This human's power was simply too terrifying, completely beyond her imagination. His invincible abilities...</p><p></p><p>Here is the full English translation of the Chinese excerpt:</p><p></p><p>The methods made me shudder.</p><p></p><p>I could never defeat him, not even the slightest bit of hope existed. However, she still had a glimmer of hope to escape.</p><p></p><p>The teleportation array!</p><p></p><p>As long as she could escape into that teleportation array, she would be safe.</p><p></p><p>Although the other party's speed was fast enough, she was very close to the teleportation array!</p><p></p><p>In the blink of an eye, her body arrived in front of the teleportation array.</p><p></p><p>That's it, I've escaped! She couldn't help but feel excited and want to cry.</p><p></p><p>As a divine beast from the Star Realm, she had killed countless human cultivators and other star beasts over the years, her hands already stained with fresh blood.</p><p></p><p>But it was not until today, when the threat of death fell upon her, that she realized how wonderful it was to be alive!</p><p></p><p>But just at that moment, a golden blade-like light that sparked in the air suddenly slashed across her waist, cutting her in half like slicing through a cabbage.</p><p></p><p>Mo Yu's pupils suddenly dilated, and a suffocating feeling of death enveloped her heart.</p><p></p><p>Was she going to die? Was she going to die in the human world? No! She couldn't die!</p><p></p><p>She had painstakingly cultivated to the Innate Eighth Rank, climbing up step by step. If she died here, she would be utterly unwilling.</p><p></p><p>Mustering the last of her strength, she took advantage of the impact force of Ye Xiao's blade and forcefully flew into the teleportation array.</p><p></p><p>Success! She finally entered the teleportation array, and the formation would quickly close, and that human cultivator would not dare to rashly enter. Moreover, in just a few seconds, she would be teleported back to the Star Realm, to the camp of the star beast clan.</p><p></p><p>She could almost smell the intoxicating scent of the green grass in the star beast stronghold.</p><p></p><p>She had also brought back the just-awakened imperial bloodline of the human cultivators. As long as she could return to the side of the Fierce God, he would surely repair her body, and might even greatly reward her.</p><p></p><p>She, who had just escaped from the brink of death, was now fantasizing about the upcoming merits, a sudden happiness surging from the depths of hell to the heights of heaven.</p><p></p><p>However, at this moment, another change occurred.</p><p></p><p>Suddenly, a violent explosion came from behind her.</p><p></p><p>Boom! After the violent explosion, there was a powerful shockwave.</p><p></p><p>The fierce wind blew, ruffling her short hair, making her turn back with some bewilderment.</p><p></p><p>Her pupils suddenly dilated, her eyes bulging to the extreme.</p><p></p><p>What did she see? That human cultivator, wielding a dragon-patterned weapon, be it a saber or a sword, was hacking at the teleportation array entrance, making it chaotic and unable to close quickly.</p><p></p><p>This guy, is he so crazy? Damn it, at this rate, with his speed, she would definitely be caught up.</p><p></p><p>No, she couldn't keep carrying this imperial bloodline.</p><p></p><p>If this continues, she will die.</p><p></p><p>Mo Yu didn't dare to hesitate for a moment, immediately throwing the still unconscious Qin Yu Yan in her hand to Ye Xiao.</p><p></p><p>However, after Ye Xiao received Qin Yu Yan, he did not immediately retreat from the teleportation array, but instead continued to rush towards her.</p><p></p><p>At this moment, Mo Yu was dumbfounded.</p><p></p><p>What's going on? I've already let go of your imperial bloodline, why are you still chasing me? Feeling the aura of death emanating from Ye Xiao, Mo Yu was scared to death.</p><p></p><p>"Fierce God, save me!"</p><p></p><p>She let out a shrill scream, and the next moment, she was pierced through the chest by Ye Xiao's sword, suppressing all her spiritual energy, and then forcibly drawn into the spatial storage ring.</p><p></p><p>It's over!</p><p></p><p>She's done for! In the last moments of her unconsciousness, she couldn't help but shed two lines of desperate tears.</p><p></p><p>Why, why did she come here?</p><p></p><p>Why didn't she leave earlier?</p><p></p><p>If she had left a second earlier, she wouldn't have died here.</p><p></p><p>Alas, there are no "ifs" in this world.</p><p></p><p>Well, perhaps this is the end of this life.</p><p></p><p>May in the next life, she will never encounter this human demon again.</p><p></p><p>In the teleportation array, after capturing the last star beast, Mo Yu, Ye Xiao immediately retreated while holding Qin Yu Yan.</p><p></p><p>The entrance of the formation was about to close, Ye Xiao exerted the Divine Sense Technique to the extreme! Seeing that the entrance was about to seal, Ye Xiao held Qin Yu Yan with one hand and tightly gripped the Great Dragon, slashing three times.</p><p></p><p>Boom, boom, boom...</p><p></p><p>The powerful sword qi frantically hacked at the teleportation array entrance, delaying it for half a second.</p><p></p><p>Finally, in the last 0.01 seconds before the teleportation array closed, they flew out!</p><p></p><p>Ye Xiao let out a sigh of relief, it was a close call.</p><p></p><p>But just at this moment, the sky above suddenly began to twist and turn.</p><p></p><p>The teleportation array that had already closed was now being forcibly opened again!</p><p></p><p>Ye Xiao's pupils contracted, this was not opened by the usual method, but forcibly torn open by sheer power! Was it the last cry of that Mo Yu that summoned the powerful star beast expert?</p>

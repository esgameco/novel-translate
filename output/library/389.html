        <div class="content">
            <p>Here is the full English translation of the Chinese excerpt:</p><p></p><p>The Netherworld Wolf sneered disdainfully.</p><p></p><p>"So you also want to escape, huh! I thought you were just lying there the whole time, not even letting out a fart. I thought you were living it up. Didn't think you wanted to run away at all."</p><p></p><p>The Big Fish rubbed his fins again.</p><p></p><p>"Brother, how can you say that? It's not that I don't want to leave, I just couldn't find a way out. Now that I've finally met you two, of course I want to hitch a ride with you."</p><p></p><p>The Netherworld Wolf then nodded arrogantly.</p><p></p><p>"Alright, even though you're trash, with some training, you might be slightly useful. </p><p>I'll take you back to see the master. He should find you interesting."</p><p></p><p>"Thank you, thank you so much."</p><p></p><p>The Big Fish had a beaming smile on his face. As long as he could escape from here and not be sliced up by Ye Xiao every day, he would be completely satisfied.</p><p></p><p>Before, he had no way to escape, so he could only lie there passively. </p><p>But now that he has a chance, he definitely doesn't want to give it up.</p><p></p><p>"Oh right, brother and sister, I just want to ask, without any offense, this star beast you mentioned earlier..."</p><p></p><p>"You mean Dragon Blood Tiger Brother?"</p><p></p><p>"Yes, yes, that's the one! Dragon Blood Tiger Brother! Is he really that strong?"</p><p></p><p>"Of course."</p><p></p><p>At this moment, both the Netherworld Wolf and Lan Xin Narcissus couldn't help but reveal a hint of reverence, admiration, and even a trace of fear on their faces.</p><p></p><p>"He's even fought and defeated a dragon!"</p><p></p><p>"Even if it was just a young dragon, it was still a dragon!"</p><p></p><p>The Netherworld Wolf said proudly.</p><p></p><p>After hearing these words, the Big Fish couldn't help but reveal a joyful smile on his face, his eyes filled with a strong sense of hope.</p><p></p><p>It seems like he really does have a chance at being saved now.</p><p></p><p>He had originally thought that he had no hope left in this life, destined to become Ye Xiao's food forever.</p><p>But unexpectedly, this Ye Xiao fellow went and got himself in trouble, capturing people with powerful backers.</p><p></p><p>Did he think they were all as weak as the master?</p><p>The star beasts residing with these powerful groups may have some brains, and they don't dare to provoke them.</p><p>But this fellow went and provoked two of them, capturing them both. </p><p>If he doesn't die, then who will?</p><p></p><p>However, a few hours later, around dusk when the library was closing, the seal on the basement was broken again.</p><p>A massive figure was thrown in.</p><p></p><p>"Look, another star beast has arrived."</p><p></p><p>The Three Sovereign Beasts immediately perked up.</p><p></p><p>The Big Fish spoke first: "Ah! This time it's a tiger!"</p><p></p><p>"Tiger!"</p><p></p><p>Hearing this word, for some reason, the Netherworld Wolf and Lan Xin Narcissus felt a shiver in their chests.</p><p>Then, the two of them immediately rushed forward. But when they fully saw the other's face, their complexions instantly turned as pale as wax.</p><p>Not only that, their bodies also started trembling uncontrollably.</p><p></p><p>"How could this be? This is impossible! I don't believe it. This can't be real. Waaah, I don't believe it!"</p><p></p><p>Lan Xin Narcissus started sobbing softly.</p><p></p><p>The Big Fish's face darkened.</p><p></p><p>"Hold on, why are you two making that expression? Don't tell me this guy is the Dragon Blood Tiger you were talking about!"</p><p></p><p>The trembling Netherworld Wolf said, "I don't want to say he is, but he really is. But how...how could he have lost so badly?"</p><p></p><p>In fact, this Dragon Blood Tiger did have some abilities.</p><p>Ye Xiao not only used the Annihilation Technique, but also the Elemental Eyes.</p><p>The combination of these two powerful techniques was what allowed him to instantly kill the Dragon Blood Tiger!</p><p>If it had been the Netherworld Wolf or Lan Xin Narcissus, Ye Xiao would only need to use one technique, and he wouldn't even need to exert his full strength, to easily defeat them.</p><p></p><p>The Big Fish couldn't help but sneer.</p><p>"And you two were praising him as some amazing expert earlier. I thought he was really that powerful, but it turns out he's just another fool.</p><p>Ah, what a waste of my good mood. I got all excited for nothing."</p><p></p><p>The Big Fish angrily went back to his corner.</p><p></p><p>The Netherworld Wolf spoke again:</p><p>"We won't lose, we absolutely won't lose. The master has more powerful sovereign beasts and pets, he will definitely send even stronger ones to rescue us.</p><p>Oh right, the Azure Dragon King! We have the Azure Dragon King! He possesses the bloodline of the dragon race, his strength is comparable to the Ninth Realm of the Divine Boundary, even stronger than Big Brother Dragon Blood Tiger's! He will definitely be able to save us."</p><p></p><p>A day later, seeing a huge sea serpent thrown in, the Netherworld Wolf started trembling again.</p><p></p><p>"We also have the Crab Sovereign Beast! The Crab Sovereign Beast is our senior, his strength has already reached the peak of the Ninth Realm of the Divine Boundary, almost reaching the Shattering God Realm! He will definitely be able to save us."</p><p></p><p>Another day passed.</p><p></p><p>"We also have Senior Shrimp God! Senior Shrimp God's strength is also at the Shattering God Realm, but he is even stronger than the Crab Sovereign Beast, because he is over a thousand years older!"</p><p></p><p>After another day, seeing the giant dragon shrimp that had just been thrown in, the Netherworld Wolf was about to cry.</p><p></p><p>"We...we also have..."</p><p></p><p>At this point, his words were cut off by Lan Xin Narcissus covering his mouth.</p><p></p><p>"You don't need to say anymore. The master has been good to us, you should just leave one top-tier sovereign beast pet for him."</p><p></p><p>Here is the full English translation of the Chinese excerpt:</p><p></p><p>"Otherwise, he would be too lonely by himself.</p><p></p><p>Those are the ones he has cultivated for over two thousand years with great difficulty."</p><p></p><p>The Underworld Wolf wiped away a tear.</p><p></p><p>"You're right, the master has been so good to us, we should leave one behind for the master." <div class="contentadv"><script>loadAdv(7,3);</script></div>The Big Fish looked at the group of star beasts with disdain.</p><p></p><p>"If you didn't know any better, you'd think you're all so impressive! What's all this fuss about? Isn't it tiring to think so much every day? You should just lie down and relax like me."</p><p></p><p>The Dragon Blood Tiger gave him a glance, then gestured to the Underworld Wolf, who nodded and slowly approached the Big Fish.</p><p></p><p>The Big Fish was startled.</p><p></p><p>"What do you want to do?"</p><p></p><p>The Underworld Wolf sneered.</p><p></p><p>"If I can't deal with Ye Xiao, do you think I can't deal with you?"</p><p></p><p>The Big Fish shivered.</p><p></p><p>"Don't you dare try anything! I warn you, I'm the master's livestock now, I have to provide star beast meat on time and in the required quantity every day. If you dare to lay a hand on me, and the old man finds out, you'll die a horrible death!"</p><p></p><p>The Underworld Wolf snorted.</p><p></p><p>"Among all of us here, who is not stronger than you? Providing a little bit of star beast meat is nothing compared to you, you stinking fish."</p><p></p><p>The Big Fish was completely panicked.</p><p></p><p>"Big brother, I misspoke just now. Please hit me, it hurts~!"</p><p></p><p>"I'm hitting you because you're a little bastard!"</p><p></p><p>"Ouch! It hurts, go easy, ah~ Don't hit there, that place can't be hit!"</p><p></p><p>On the other side, on the Lingwu Warship of the Cloud Family, Cloud Shuai stood on the deck, his face ashen and ice-cold.</p><p></p><p>His eyes were slightly red, bloodshot, gazing into the distance.</p><p></p><p>The distant Cloud Zhenwu looked at him with some pity, and Huan Huan walked up to him, cupping his hands and saying:</p><p></p><p>"Elder, let's go back. It's windy outside!"</p><p></p><p>Cloud Shuai gave a self-mocking smile.</p><p></p><p>"Do you think I still have the mood to go back now?"</p><p></p><p>His own strength was very poor, his talent was really unsightly.</p><p></p><p>Despite his cultivation being at the Slaughter God Realm Fifth Layer, among his peers in the Cloud Family, he was only a loser.</p><p></p><p>He was not of the same generation as Uncle Ning Zhiyuan, but of the same generation as Ning Zhiyuan's grandfather. To put it bluntly, Ning Zhiyuan's grandfather, the former young master of the Ning Family, was now at around the Slaughter God Realm Ninth Layer, while he was only at the Fifth Layer, his strength was considerably low! After all, the Cloud Family was different from the other direct descendants of the XuanYuan, the Cloud Family had the resources of Mount XuanYuan for many years, and the cultivation level of the Cloud Family disciples was far higher than other clans.</p><p></p><p>So he could only choose to be a Beast Tamer.</p><p></p><p>This is also why? He wanted to obtain Ye Xiao's blood.</p><p></p><p>Because he was so eager to improve his own talent.</p><p></p><p>His so-called, for the sake of the Xuanyuan Clan, not wanting to cultivate an ingrate, was just to deceive Cloud Zhenwu.</p><p></p><p>His true purpose was only that he himself wanted Ye Xiao's blood.</p><p></p><p>But now, he had lost badly.</p><p></p><p>The star beasts he had cultivated for over two thousand years, the most powerful ones, were all gone now.</p><p></p><p>The remaining scraps were not even as good as one of them.</p><p></p><p>This time, it was a real loss! A loss to the extreme.</p><p></p><p>"Zhenwu, go get the cage from the innermost part of my shelf."</p><p></p><p>Cloud Zhenwu was startled.</p><p></p><p>"Elder, forget it! This is the last one left. If it doesn't come back, you'll be in big trouble. The strongest of the remaining ones are only at the Spirit Realm Sixth or Seventh Layer, your strength has been depleted too much. In the future, even if you return to the clan, it won't be easy to explain, after all, those premium star beasts were also captured with the help of the clan before."</p><p></p><p>"Shut up with your nonsense! I want to make one last attempt. This last beast lord of mine is already strong enough to completely match the Slaughter God Realm First Layer. I don't believe that the other side can capture this one as well!"</p><p></p><p>Cloud Shuai was already desperate.</p><p></p><p>He was no longer just looking for that heaven-gifted child.</p><p></p><p>Now, he was fighting for his own reputation!</p><p></p><p>For his own glory and dignity! If he chose to give up, he would be too embarrassed.</p><p></p><p>As the saying goes, "don't eat steamed buns and fight for face", even if he died, he had to regain a bit of his dignity.</p><p></p><p>Cloud Zhenwu sighed deeply.</p><p></p><p>He knew that the decision Cloud Shuai was making now was very unwise.</p><p></p><p>But he had no way to persuade him, because he was just a small disciple of the Cloud Family, while the other was an elder of the Cloud Family.</p><p></p><p>He only had the qualification to obey the orders.</p><p></p><p>The sun set again, darkness descended, and Ye Xiao strolled the streets of Jianghai City.</p><p></p><p>He was anticipating.</p><p></p><p>Anticipating the arrival of the star beasts again.</p><p></p><p>Although he didn't know why, there had been so many beast lords appearing in Jianghai City recently.</p><p></p><p>But he had really made a fortune because of it.</p><p></p><p>These star beasts, each one was extremely powerful, with an extremely rich blood aura.</p><p></p><p>More importantly, some of them were delicious when used as ingredients!</p><p></p><p>Five updates, 15,000 words.</p><p></p><p>Recommend votes and monthly votes please.</p><p></p><p>(This chapter is complete)</p>

        <h1>Chapter 95</h1>
        <div class="content">
            <p>Here is my translation of the Chinese excerpt:</p><p></p><p>Ning Yuhen's heart shuddered, and he answered solemnly.</p><p></p><p>"Don't worry, manager."</p><p></p><p>"Then go."</p><p></p><p>With that, Ye Xiao turned and walked into the courtyard.</p><p></p><p>"I don't want my peaceful life to be disturbed. If my identity is known, it will be counted against the Silver Fox Clan."</p><p></p><p>Ning Yuhen deeply bowed to Ye Xiao.</p><p></p><p>"Manager, thank you for your care all this time. Rest assured, the Silver Fox Clan will never reveal even a fraction of your secret."</p><p></p><p>The Dowager Empress smiled faintly. "Child, can we go now?"</p><p></p><p>Ning Yuhen nodded.</p><p></p><p>Then the Dowager Empress glanced at Youwei, and Youwei immediately took Ning Yuhen and flew away with the wind.</p><p></p><p>As for Ye Xiao, he returned to his room to study the healing imperial art of the Silver Fox Clan, the Chenxing Technique.</p><p></p><p>Ye Xiao had never heard the term "imperial art" before, but he understood that above the Sect Master level techniques, there were other even higher-level techniques.</p><p></p><p>The techniques he had previously synthesized, like the Tyrant Saber, were all above the Sect Master level.</p><p></p><p>Now it seems that this technique might be an imperial art!</p><p></p><p>"Imperial art," Ye Xiao murmured, raising his eyebrows slightly.</p><p></p><p>"Could it be that the ancient peerless emperors cultivated the so-called imperial arts?"</p><p></p><p>He could feel that the cultivation momentum of techniques like the Tyrant Saber had not yet reached its limit.</p><p></p><p>Cultivating these techniques, he would surely be able to break through the limits of the Divine Sect and reach higher levels.</p><p></p><p>He just didn't know what those higher levels were called.</p><p></p><p>He quickly finished reviewing the Chenxing Technique, and the Golden Book recorded it.</p><p></p><p>The night passed quickly.</p><p></p><p>The next morning, when Ye Xiao woke up from his dream, the quilt had risen above his line of sight, blocking his view of the foot of the bed. </p><p></p><p>This was not because he had cultivated the Chenxing Technique, but since he had learned the Indestructible Divine Skill, he had been waking up to this scene every morning - he was already used to it.</p><p></p><p>His consciousness was immersed in the divine soul of the Golden Book, and he was slightly surprised.</p><p></p><p>The Chenxing Technique had indeed been cultivated, but the imprinted Chenxing Technique and the Supplementary Heaven Technique were beginning to emit a faint golden glow.</p><p></p><p>This meant that they were missing one or two more techniques to be synthesized again! Could it be that above the imperial arts, even stronger techniques could be synthesized?</p><p></p><p>This filled Ye Xiao with great joy.</p><p></p><p>If imperial arts could continue to be synthesized, his future advancement would be remarkable.</p><p></p><p>Additionally, this also indirectly confirmed that the Supplementary Heaven Technique, Tyrant Saber, Purple Vortex Sea, Heavenly Slash, Indestructible Divine Skill, Divine Will Technique, and Grand Celestial Heavenly Formation were all imperial art-level techniques.</p><p></p><p>In the future, these other types of techniques might also be able to be merged.</p><p></p><p>However, one thing was a bit troublesome - ordinary techniques were easy to find, but imperial arts were not.</p><p></p><p>Where could he obtain some imperial arts? </p><p></p><p>This thing might not even be found in the library.</p><p></p><p>And after synthesizing one imperial art from basic techniques, no matter how many ordinary techniques he looked at, the Golden Book would not continue to record them to synthesize another imperial art.</p><p></p><p>But soon, Ye Xiao shook his head, no longer thinking too much about this matter. Whatever, the path will reveal itself when the time comes. As the saying goes, "When the river reaches the bridge, it will naturally flow straight."</p><p></p><p>Ye Xiao first came to try the Chenxing Technique.</p><p></p><p>Here is the full English translation of the Chinese excerpt:</p><p></p><p>The Celestial Star Technique and the Heavenly Restoration Art, although both are imperial-level healing arts, have some differences between them.</p><p></p><p>Just like the foundational techniques of other martial arts, there are many different methods, and the Celestial Star Technique and the Heavenly Restoration Art can be seen as two distinct expressions of the imperial-level healing arts.</p><p></p><p>The Heavenly Restoration Art can rapidly heal wounds, even if one's body is completely shattered, it can fully restore it.</p><p></p><p>While the Celestial Star Technique is about regenerative ability.</p><p></p><p>For example, if Ye Xiao were to cut off his own arm, the Heavenly Restoration Art would heal it by reattaching the severed limb to his body.</p><p></p><p>But the Celestial Star Technique would instead regenerate a brand new arm.</p><p></p><p>Speaking of which, King Ai's healing art also seems to be quite powerful.</p><p></p><p>It's unknown whether his healing art is an imperial-level technique, or if it's a completely different imperial art altogether.</p><p></p><p>If that's the case, then Ye Xiao could consider extracting King Ai's star core and refine the healing art from it.</p><p></p><p>After all, King Ai is not a good person.</p><p></p><p>Regardless, Ye Xiao has gained another life-saving technique, and has also learned about further synthesis, which is ultimately a good thing.</p><p></p><p>In the morning, Ye Xiao had breakfast and came to the library for work, accompanied by the Jade Cat.</p><p></p><p>Many people in the library were discussing the Silver Fox Star Beast incident. </p><p></p><p>A lot of people knew that the Silver Fox Star Beast was Ning Yuhen.</p><p></p><p>This caused people to look at Ye Xiao a bit differently, since he was quite close to Ning Yuhen.</p><p></p><p>In the morning, the defense squad came to investigate, and Ye Xiao was also called in for questioning. Fortunately, Gu Hai had specially looked after him, so they didn't interrogate Ye Xiao too much, just a brief chat before leaving.</p><p></p><p>Gu Hai didn't come, he had already gone to participate in the elite camp's special training. Likely after coming out, his cultivation would have a huge improvement.</p><p></p><p>Everything gradually returned to normal.</p><p></p><p>Ye Xiao continued to go to the upper level of the library to read books, coming early and leaving late, clocking in on time.</p><p></p><p>In the following days, he found another forging technique, and after mastering nine foundational forging techniques, the golden pages in his Book of God's Soul that recorded forging techniques finally began to emit a faint golden glow.</p><p></p><p>This meant that as long as he found one more foundational forging technique, he would be able to fuse an imperial-level forging technique.</p><p></p><p>During this period, Ye Xiao would also buy some pig iron and other materials every night, refine them, and then sell them back the next day.</p><p></p><p>Since he was only refining up to superior-grade weapons at most, there was no need to worry about causing a commotion.</p><p></p><p>In this world, imperial-level techniques are something that ordinary people cannot touch. So master-level is the highest level that many people can only dream of, in terms of techniques, equipment, and elixirs! Below master-level, whether it's superior or ordinary, the prices won't be too high.</p><p></p><p>Take weapons for example, the difference between superior-grade and master-grade is heaven and earth! </p><p></p><p>Master-grade weapons start at hundreds of thousands, while superior-grade are usually around ten to twenty thousand.</p><p></p><p>The gap can be dozens or even hundreds of times! Because ordinary and superior-grade weapons can be forged by common craftsmen, only master-grade requires a true master to create.</p><p></p><p>But masters are already very rare, and most of them choose to hunt star beasts, making those on the ground even fewer! However, even so, Ye Xiao was able to earn a small fortune by refining and reselling a little bit every night.</p><p></p><p>[This is the end of the chapter.]</p>

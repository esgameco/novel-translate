        <h1>Chapter 204</h1>
        <div class="content">
            <p>Here is the full English translation of the Chinese excerpt:</p><p></p><p>In the vast southwest forest, dark clouds gathered, and thunderous roars echoed. </p><p></p><p>Countless figures who witnessed this scene couldn't help but feel their scalps tingle and their souls shudder.</p><p></p><p>As the common saying goes: The might of heaven is unshakable!</p><p></p><p>In the face of heaven's might, any person is as insignificant as an ant, unable to muster the will to resist.</p><p></p><p>The powerful sect masters stationed in the forest were also involuntarily moved to exclaim:</p><p></p><p>"The forest has never experienced such a situation before. Why is there suddenly thunder today?"</p><p></p><p>"Lightning in a clear sky - this is not ordinary rain and thunder. This is a tribulation! Someone is undergoing a tribulation, and because their strength is too great, they have triggered the monitoring power of the laws, thus inducing a lightning tribulation."</p><p></p><p>"But who could it be? There shouldn't be such a powerful expert entering this forest!"</p><p></p><p>"I don't know, perhaps it's one of the star beasts in this forest. Who knows?"</p><p></p><p>"Regardless of who it is, we absolutely cannot provoke them. If we anger them, all the human cultivators in this forest, including us, will be in great trouble."</p><p></p><p>The distant Xia Bingning, sensing the vast aura above the forest, also couldn't help but feel her heart racing.</p><p></p><p>"Such overwhelming pressure! This person was only at the Xiantian Eighth Realm before, but now they must have reached the Xiantian Ninth Realm, right? </p><p></p><p>How terrifying! </p><p></p><p>Their age may not even be older than mine.</p><p></p><p>But their talent, their cultivation, can easily crush me.</p><p></p><p>If they are given more time to grow, I wonder who in this world can be their match? Fortunately, I now know their name is Ye Xiao.</p><p></p><p>There will surely be a day when we meet again."</p><p></p><p>After this startling realization, Xia Bingning immediately took out a disc from herself, infused it with spiritual energy, and activated a teleportation array. </p><p></p><p>She had many valuable items on her, easily inviting the covetous gaze of others, so it was best to quickly return to her own home.</p><p></p><p>In the forest, the lightning tribulation continued. After undergoing the baptism of the tribulation, Ye Xiao's skin became even more translucent and flawless.</p><p></p><p>The lightning that previously scorched his skin could no longer harm him at all.</p><p></p><p>Each realm of cultivation brings earth-shattering improvements to the cultivator's physique.</p><p></p><p>If Ye Xiao, at the Xiantian Seventh Realm, could already rival the defense of a Xiantian Ninth Realm expert through the use of the Invincible Vajra Technique, then now, with his further advancement, his defense would be unbreakable to anyone below the Monarch Realm.</p><p></p><p>This is just the change in his physical body. The transformations in his cultivation technique and the speed of his spiritual energy absorption would also be greatly enhanced.</p><p></p><p>His spiritual power would become even stronger, and his offensive capabilities need not be mentioned.</p><p></p><p>Comprehensive and substantial improvements - Ye Xiao's current changes were not just a single step up, but a quantum leap.</p><p></p><p>He exhaled, and the breath he released was filled with dense spiritual energy, even more concentrated than the surrounding space.</p><p></p><p>Clenching his fists, Ye Xiao didn't know the exact extent of his current power. The specific data was beyond his ability to measure at the moment.</p><p></p><p>Just like the previous breakthroughs, his newfound strength was so overwhelming that it was slightly difficult to control, requiring some time to get accustomed to.</p><p></p><p>"So this is the power of the Xiantian Ninth Realm? The peak of the Sect Master Realm! It feels like I can now do anything."</p><p></p><p>The lightning in the sky continued to pour down relentlessly.</p><p></p><p>Ye Xiao glanced up and indifferently uttered a single word: "Scatter!"</p><p></p><p>With this simple word, he unleashed his immense power, frantically striking the sky.</p><p></p><p>Boom! This time, Ye Xiao didn't even use any cultivation techniques or skills, relying solely on the vast spiritual energy within him to attack.</p><p></p><p>Yet even so, the thunderclouds in the sky were instantly blasted open with a massive gap, and then gradually dissipated due to a lack of cohesion.</p><p></p><p>With a thought, Ye Xiao's body instantly appeared at the foot of a mountain.</p><p></p><p>His speed was even faster and stronger than before! However, having learned from previous experiences, he did not unleash his power to the fullest, not even using the Divine Will Incantation.</p><p></p><p>Even so, he felt that his speed had already reached the level of his previous Divine Will Incantation.</p><p></p><p>He wondered how powerful his movement techniques would be when he unleashed them to the fullest? Probably able to create lightning and fire from the friction with the air around him.</p><p></p><p>Fortunately, he had the foresight to prepare a set of black scale armor made from black snake scales, Aer King's skin, and other materials, which he wore as casual clothing.</p><p></p><p>Otherwise, his clothes would have been reduced to ashes in no time from the intense friction during his high-speed movements.</p><p></p><p>Now, Ye Xiao no longer needed the Profound Heaven Sweeping Technique to scan his surroundings. Merely standing here, he could effortlessly sense everything within a vast radius.</p><p></p><p>At least within ten kilometers, Ye Xiao felt like he was observing everything up close.</p><p></p><p>This was perhaps another aspect of becoming stronger - feeling less and less human.</p><p></p><p>Because his vision had completely transcended the limits of ordinary human senses, breaking through the constraints of sight, smell, touch, and other sensory perceptions.</p><p></p><p>Here is the full English translation of the Chinese excerpt:</p><p></p><p>By this time, many people had already crawled out of the corners.</p><p></p><p>They were all adventurers from the outside.</p><p></p><p>At this moment, everyone couldn't help but heave a sigh of relief, with a look of joy on their faces, as if they had just escaped a disaster.</p><p></p><p>However, even so, when the people thought about what had just happened, their faces were still filled with shock and terror.</p><p></p><p>"What was that just now? Suddenly there was lightning and thunder."</p><p></p><p>"Wow, I thought it was going to rain, so I even put on my raincoat, but then it cleared up again."</p><p></p><p>"Shao Er, you bastard, you just swore that you loved me, and then the heavens started crazily striking lightning. It seems you never loved me at all, let's break up."</p><p></p><p>"It's not my fault, how could I have known the heavens would suddenly strike lightning? I really do love you!"</p><p></p><p>At this moment, a familiar voice also reached Ye Xiao's ears.</p><p></p><p>"Brother Xiong, what a coincidence, you're here too!"</p><p></p><p>Ye Xiao turned around, it was the previous Huang Tao.</p><p></p><p>He and a few of his teammates, all heavily loaded, it seemed they had harvested a lot of good things from this trip to the forest sea.</p><p></p><p>The group came up to him.</p><p></p><p>"Brother Xiong, have you found the flower you were looking for?"</p><p></p><p>Ye Xiao nodded.</p><p></p><p>"I found some."</p><p></p><p>"That's good. What just happened was too scary, I almost thought the mountains were going to collapse and the end of the world was coming, I was even ready to write my will.</p><p></p><p>But now, although it's calm, who knows what terrifying things might happen next? Let's hurry and get out of here."</p><p></p><p>Ye Xiao was just about to speak when his keen senses made him look back towards the mountains.</p><p></p><p>Suddenly, with a thunderous cracking sound, the entire mountain began to crumble.</p><p></p><p>In fact, not only this one mountain, but several other mountains also started to crack and split apart.</p><p></p><p>Ye Xiao's breakthrough had caused quite a commotion. </p><p></p><p>Both the previous rift that had split the ground, slaying the myriad of red and green leaves, as well as the subsequent thunderstorm that had bombarded the mountains, had placed tremendous pressure on this mountain range.</p><p></p><p>Now, they could no longer withstand it.</p><p></p><p>Seeing this scene, countless people began to panic.</p><p></p><p>"The mountain is collapsing!"</p><p></p><p>"Run!"</p><p></p><p>Countless cultivators began to flee towards the outside, Huang Tao and the others also had grave expressions.</p><p></p><p>"Not good! Hurry and run!"</p><p></p><p>But most here were only at the later stages of the Qi Condensation Realm, not even reaching the Nascent Soul Realm. With their speed, there was no way they could outrun the speed of these collapsing mountains.</p><p></p><p>If these mountains truly collapsed, who knew how many people would die.</p><p></p><p>Moreover, there were still many people up on the mountains, they would not be able to escape the collapse either.</p><p></p><p>Ye Xiao's brow furrowed.</p><p></p><p>All of this was caused by him, if he were to let so many people die for no reason, that would be a grave sin.</p><p></p><p>Therefore, with a slight sigh, he could only choose to intervene.</p><p></p><p>Huang Tao, who had already run out, looked back and saw Ye Xiao still standing there, and immediately shouted loudly, "Brother Xiong, hurry and run! You'll be crushed to death standing there!"</p><p></p><p>His companion couldn't help but roar angrily, "What time is this? You still have the heart to care about others? Hurry and run! If you don't run now, it'll be too late!"</p><p></p><p>However, just as their words fell, a vast golden light suddenly expanded from Ye Xiao's body, enveloping him completely, making him look like a holy Buddha descending.</p><p></p><p>At this moment, the Dharma Sutra within him was frantically operating, absorbing spiritual energy at the fastest speed.</p><p></p><p>The speed of absorbing spiritual energy was so fast that it even caused a vacuum zone to appear around him.</p><p></p><p>Subsequently, several golden lights radiated out from Ye Xiao's body, slowly forming gigantic Buddha hands, thousands of meters tall, gently pressing against the mountains that were about to collapse.</p><p></p><p>The noise gradually disappeared, until the surroundings were completely silent and peaceful.</p><p></p><p>In this moment, it was as if all the disasters had been stopped.</p><p></p><p>All the people around saw this scene and were petrified on the spot.</p><p></p><p>They simply couldn't believe their eyes.</p><p></p><p>What did they see? A human being, using his own power, actually resisting the collapse of several mountains.</p><p></p><p>What a great power was this? This was something only a god could accomplish!</p><p></p><p>Especially Huang Tao and the others, their hearts were pounding, their minds blank.</p><p></p><p>This was the person they had casually brought along to make up the numbers? The one they had randomly recruited was actually this strong?</p><p></p><p>Was the heavens playing a joke on them? They had actually become teammates with an existence comparable to a god, and even formed a team with him.</p><p></p><p>At this moment, their emotions, apart from shock, honor and joy, could not find a fourth feeling.</p><p></p><p>"I, Huang Tao, have actually become teammates with an existence like a god in this life? Heavens, this joke of yours is too big."</p>

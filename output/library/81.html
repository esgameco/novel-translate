        <h1>Chapter 81</h1>
        <div class="content">
            <p>Here is the full English translation of the Chinese excerpt:</p><p></p><p>But before Ye Xiao could take his next breath, the voice of King Aier rang out again.</p><p></p><p>"You little bastard, go ahead and let me speak."</p><p></p><p>Boom! "Damn it..."</p><p></p><p>Boom! "Fuck..."</p><p></p><p>Boom! Each time, as soon as King Aier had just reconstituted his soul body and was about to open his mouth to speak, he was ruthlessly shattered by Ye Xiao.</p><p></p><p>In less than a minute, King Aier had been forcibly shattered a total of twenty-eight times.</p><p></p><p>Even a soul body can feel pain! Each time, King Aier seemed to suffer the most agonizing torment.</p><p></p><p>But his soul body clone quickly recovered again.</p><p></p><p>Ye Xiao narrowed his eyes slightly, this time he did not attack again.</p><p></p><p>The repeated attacks had already shown that they would not work.</p><p></p><p>Although the one in front of him was only a fragment of King Aier's soul, it was far from reaching the spiritual power level of King Aier's main soul body, yet it could withstand countless attacks from his Taixuan Tiangong and recover, could it be that...</p><p></p><p>"Your soul body also has the ability to heal quickly like your physical body?"</p><p></p><p>The just-restored King Aier soul body let out a smug chuckle.</p><p></p><p>"Correct, you've finally figured it out!</p><p></p><p>Although this king doesn't want to admit it, the truth is, your methods are very powerful, you can even be considered the strongest among the great masters I've encountered so far! But even so, you still can't kill this king's soul body clone.</p><p></p><p>To kill this king's soul body clone, you would have to destroy every corner of this room, and every bit of this king's scattered spiritual power! The amount of spiritual power required is massive, and the attacks must be continuous! Even if you give this king the slightest chance to breathe, this king can still recover again.</p><p></p><p>Do you feel despair now, human?"</p><p></p><p>By revealing his own weakness, King Aier was not low in intelligence, he was just too confident.</p><p></p><p>Confident that Ye Xiao could never do what he said.</p><p></p><p>In fact, even if Ye Xiao was a great master cultivating a spiritual system technique, he also had his limits.</p><p></p><p>As an ordinary human great master, even if he exerted his full power to release spiritual power attacks, to be able to do it continuously without even a 0.001 second interval, five seconds would already be very good.</p><p></p><p>King Aier, with his Saint Monarch-level cultivation, also had rich martial arts experience, his experience allowed him to clearly discern this point.</p><p></p><p>However, the next moment, Ye Xiao calmly uttered two words.</p><p></p><p>"Thank you."</p><p></p><p>King Aier: "???"</p><p></p><p>He hadn't even reacted yet, when in the next second, the entire room was instantly filled with Ye Xiao's spiritual power.</p><p></p><p>Subsequently, countless massive spiritual power blades rapidly condensed.</p><p></p><p>In this moment, King Aier was completely dumbfounded! This spiritual power was so powerful, far stronger than a normal great master, just looking at the amount, not to mention five seconds, even fifty seconds, King Aier would have no doubt at all!</p><p></p><p>How did he do it? He's just a great master, a first-grade great master! When he was at this cultivation level, he couldn't even do this, how could he? How could he? Amidst his shock and speechlessness, Ye Xiao's blades had already started to move.</p><p></p><p>Countless spiritual power blades, covering the sky, with overwhelming force, began to frantically slash at King Aier's soul body clone.</p><p></p><p>When the blades struck King Aier's body, King Aier instantly awoke.</p><p></p><p>Wait a minute.</p><p></p><p>This familiar feeling!</p><p></p><p>This blade feeling! This...this is the same blade that killed me in an instant when my clone fought against Yang Zhengyi! It's him!</p><p></p><p>That damn...</p><p></p><p>Here is the full English translation of the Chinese excerpt:</p><p></p><p>Young man! He extinguished his own clone with a single blade! He is not only a powerful spiritual cultivator, but also a powerful martial artist! Dual cultivation of spirit and martial arts!</p><p></p><p>By the time he realized all this, Ye Xiao had already instantly shattered his soul body.</p><p></p><p>This time, Ye Xiao did not hold back, simultaneously activating the Taixuan Tiangong and the Hegemon Blade, continuing for a full minute!</p><p></p><p>Later, to ensure safety, he struck for another full minute. After two minutes, he searched with spiritual power again, and the entire room was completely devoid of the spiritual presence of Aier Wang's soul body clone.</p><p></p><p>Ye Xiao knew that this clone of Aier Wang's soul body had been completely destroyed by him.</p><p></p><p>In an underground seal outside the Jianghai City, Aier Wang's main body did not roar this time, but instead let out a strange laughter.</p><p></p><p>"Hahaha, how interesting! Among the humans, a genius of such great power has actually emerged!</p><p></p><p>I haven't been this excited in a long time! The day of the Seven Stars Convergence is approaching, my power will increase, and the breakthrough from the seal is imminent. </p><p></p><p>Little brat, just wait for me.</p><p></p><p>That young man's silver fox bloodline has already been awakened, and the powerful experts of the Silver Fox Clan will soon be drawn here. You better not get killed by the Silver Fox Clan.</p><p></p><p>Because I will personally step in and break your bones one by one."</p><p></p><p>After dealing with Aier Wang, Ye Xiao went back to work and also helped Ning Yuheng take a leave of absence.</p><p></p><p>Afterwards, he continued to read books, striving to quickly improve his strength.</p><p></p><p>This Seven Stars Convergence has forced him to work even harder.</p><p></p><p>If Aier Wang's clone was so powerful, his main body must be terrifyingly strong. Ye Xiao did not want to end up being torn apart by him.</p><p></p><p>The star beasts might even eat him, maybe even swallow him whole.</p><p></p><p>Hmm...</p><p></p><p>It's decided, I must become stronger, and then I will tear Aier Wang to pieces! By the way, I should have asked Yang Zhengyi for a map of Aier Wang's location earlier.</p><p></p><p>Having a map would have made things much easier.</p><p></p><p>I can take advantage of the fact that Aier Wang has not yet revived, and dig out his clones one by one, then destroy them one by one!</p><p></p><p>In the afternoon, while Ye Xiao was reading, a small administrator came running over, saying the director wanted to see him.</p><p></p><p>Although he didn't understand what it was about, he still had to go.</p><p></p><p>When Ye Xiao arrived, he found that in addition to the director, there was also someone he had seen before - the eminent Shaolin martial arts master who had given a speech at the Jiangbei Martial Arts Academy graduation ceremony a few days ago.</p><p></p><p>"Ye Xiao, you're here."</p><p></p><p>Ye Xiao nodded.</p><p></p><p>"Does the director have something for me?"</p><p></p><p>"I'd like to introduce you to this professor from the Shaolin Martial Arts Academy, Master Fazheng. He is also a powerful master-level cultivator.</p><p></p><p>This time, he has come to our Jianghai City on a mission, and he needs a guide.</p><p></p><p>So for the next few days, you don't need to go to work, you can take a paid leave to fully assist Master Fazheng in completing his mission."</p><p></p><p>Ye Xiao's brow furrowed slightly, prepared to refuse.</p><p></p><p>He had no interest in being a guide. How could that compare to leisurely reading books in the library?</p><p></p><p>Before he could speak, Ouyang Yunzhong continued, "These days, the municipal government will provide you with a car.</p><p></p><p>The daily expenses will be 100,000. </p><p></p><p>If Master Fazheng has any special tasks that require funding, you can call the mayor's office to apply for additional funds at any time."</p><p></p><p>This is the second update, seeking your support for the new book.

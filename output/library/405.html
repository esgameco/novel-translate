        <h1>Chapter 405</h1>
        <div class="content">
            <p>Here is the full English translation of the Chinese excerpt:</p><p></p><p>The Ning family members quickly arrived above the starry sky.</p><p></p><p>At this moment, the battle raging above the starry sky had reached a white-hot stage. Every second, people were dying, and everyone had gone mad with killing.</p><p></p><p>Four Saintly King Tombs! </p><p></p><p>That's four Saintly King Tombs!</p><p></p><p>Even a single Saintly King Tomb could make everyone fight to the death, let alone four at once. </p><p></p><p>In the previous two Saintly King Tombs they had encountered, they had not gained any benefits, but instead suffered heavy losses of troops and soldiers. It was truly regrettable.</p><p></p><p>Today, encountering these four Saintly King Tombs, they were determined to extract some benefits from them no matter what.</p><p></p><p>The disciples of the Ning family quickly joined the battlefield.</p><p></p><p>Ning Zhiyuan quickly found Zheng Fenghua, Song Qingxue and others in the chaos.</p><p></p><p>"How long have you been fighting? Have you sent people to open the Saintly King Tombs?"</p><p></p><p>"It's been a while, Shao Yu is currently breaking the formation, it shouldn't be long before he succeeds in breaking through."</p><p></p><p>As soon as the words left his mouth, Ling Shaoyu's side suddenly shouted, "The formation is open! The Saintly King Tomb has opened!"</p><p></p><p>Ning Zhiyuan and the others' eyes immediately lit up.</p><p></p><p>"Let's go! We must hurry inside."</p><p></p><p>Now, time is money, they must seize every second.</p><p></p><p>The Hundred Clan Alliance seeing this, attacked even more fiercely.</p><p></p><p>Zhu Chunqiu led several Deicide Realm experts to fight against the Deicide Realm experts of the Zheng family, Ning family and other clans, the battle was extremely intense.</p><p></p><p>In this kind of battle for resources, it is usually the top experts who fight, while the younger generation of the clan rushes to plunder the resources.</p><p></p><p>"Tell the Wolf God Clan to speed up and quickly break the formation."</p><p></p><p>"They are already speeding up."</p><p></p><p>Zhu Chunqiu glanced over, although they had already accelerated, by now they had only broken half the formation, there was still a long way to go.</p><p></p><p>This made him unable to help but feel anxious and angry.</p><p></p><p>But he was helpless, because the last time they encountered the Poisonous King Tomb, it had killed their Hundred Clan Alliance's best formation masters, otherwise the formation might have been broken long ago.</p><p></p><p>At this time, Ning Zhiyuan and the others had already entered one of the Saintly King Tombs on their side.</p><p></p><p>As soon as they entered the Saintly King Tomb, a vast, profound and thick spiritual energy surged over them.</p><p></p><p>Everyone took a deep breath, feeling refreshed and invigorated.</p><p></p><p>"The spiritual energy is so rich! We have finally truly unearthed a Saintly King Tomb!"</p><p></p><p>They exchanged glances, their eyes filled with excitement, even feeling their eyes slightly moist.</p><p></p><p>It was not easy! </p><p></p><p>Too difficult! There were so many Saintly King Tombs here, but they had been digging for several months before finally finding one.</p><p></p><p>The previous two Saintly King Tombs were simply disastrous!</p><p></p><p>The first one was already completely empty, the only remaining divine water had even been snatched away by the Hundred Clan Alliance, leaving them with a deep regret.</p><p></p><p>As for the second Saintly King Tomb, it was even worse!</p><p></p><p>The deadly poison had caused them countless casualties, even losing Divine Realm experts! It was a huge loss.</p><p></p><p>But now, they had finally found a fruitful Saintly King Tomb.</p><p></p><p>Looking at the abundant resources scattered all around - alchemy materials, forging materials, cultivation techniques, weapons, everything imaginable, too numerous to count.</p><p></p><p>Even these young masters couldn't help but have their eyes shine with greed.</p><p></p><p>Their clan certainly had far more resources than this, but those resources were not entirely theirs, but shared by the entire clan.</p><p></p><p>The resources that could truly be used by them, although not few, were still far less compared to what was before their eyes now.</p><p></p><p>It was like a person who normally lives a comfortable life with a monthly income of 40,000 or 50,000, but if suddenly tens or even hundreds of billions of dollars appeared before their eyes, the visual impact would be enough to shake their soul.</p><p></p><p>"Don't just stand there, quickly collect everything, don't leave a single divine crystal behind."</p><p></p><p>"Fill up all the storage rings."</p><p></p><p>Several people immediately began to divide the work, frantically plundering the resources here. At this moment, they no longer cared about their own image.</p><p></p><p>Even Song Qingxue, a refined young lady, was shamelessly harvesting the resources without any pretense.</p><p></p><p>Because here, it was not just this one Saintly King Tomb, but the other three as well.</p><p></p><p>Even if the Hundred Clan Alliance could take the resources from one Saintly King Tomb, there were still two more.</p><p></p><p>At this moment, whoever was faster, whoever could obtain more resources.</p><p></p><p>Ning Zhiyuan looked at Ling Shaoyu also frantically looting, and gave him a nudge.</p><p></p><p>"What are you doing? Hurry up and go break the core formation of the Saintly King Tomb! The core of the Saintly King Tomb must have even better things, after breaking it, quickly go break the formation of the second Saintly King Tomb!"</p><p></p><p>"I just barely broke through this Saintly King Tomb, let me also have a taste of the great harvest. "</p><p></p><p>"You can have your fill when you get back, now hurry up and break the formation! We must seize as many resources as possible, we can't let the Hundred Clan Alliance take more."</p><p></p><p>Hearing this, Ling Shaoyu's expression became more serious.</p><p></p><p>He immediately began to busy himself.</p><p></p><p>Here is my translation of the Chinese excerpt:</p><p></p><p>Ning Zhiyuan and the others continued to harvest at a breakneck pace.</p><p></p><p>Above the ground, Ye Xiao was in the library reading books, completely unaware of all this.</p><p></p><p>Since the Ning family would occasionally go to the starry sky, he didn't pay much attention to it.</p><p></p><p>Around noon, the Jing Emperor came over. </p><p></p><p>He looked around, took two books from the bookshelf, and then sat down across from Ye Xiao.</p><p></p><p>"Ye Xiao, you really scared this old man the other day, directly confronting the young master of the Cloud family. I almost thought you were going to die.</p><p></p><p>This time you acted too recklessly."</p><p></p><p>Ye Xiao spoke calmly and indifferently.</p><p></p><p>"The Cloud family's Cloud Shui wanted to kill me before. I have no grievances with him, but he sent out his star beasts to hunt me down. Because his star beasts can search out those with strong bloodline power.</p><p></p><p>Later, I captured his star beast, and in order to search for the star beast, he ruthlessly killed the people of Jianghai City, burning their souls to activate the violent genes in the star beast's body, so that he could find me. </p><p></p><p>If I hadn't acted, not to mention how many more people he would have killed? Even if he later found me, he would still want to kill me and do me harm.</p><p></p><p>So I had no choice but to kill him!"</p><p></p><p>The Jing Emperor nodded.</p><p></p><p>"I know about this matter."</p><p></p><p>Ye Xiao was somewhat surprised, and the Jing Emperor then spoke:</p><p></p><p>"The Cloud family has already investigated this matter. Cloud XuanYuan has notified the young masters not to continue to get entangled in this matter, and not to disturb you again."</p><p></p><p>Ye Xiao's brow furrowed slightly, somewhat puzzled.</p><p></p><p>The Jing Emperor spoke again: "I learned from the Ning family that Cloud XuanYuan is actually a pretty good person, clear about public and private matters, and never bends the law for private interests. He has already destroyed Cloud Shui's divine soul and essence blood, not allowing him to be revived.</p><p></p><p>In fact, most of the Xuanyuan Clan members are quite united.</p><p></p><p>At least in dealing with their own clan, there are very few with malicious intentions.</p><p></p><p>Cloud Shui was just an extremely rare existence.  You don't need to dwell on it too much."</p><p></p><p>Ye Xiao nodded.</p><p></p><p>He didn't expect that Cloud Xuanyuan would actually do this, which was indeed quite rare.</p><p></p><p>He could also see that the Xuanuan Clan was indeed quite united among their own clan members.</p><p></p><p>This is also why? When he chose to intervene and save Ning Zhiyuan and Ling Shaoyu in the poisonous mist back then.</p><p></p><p>However, sometimes you fear one bad apple spoils the whole barrel.</p><p></p><p>Like that trash from the Zhao family in the capital before, and now Cloud Shui.</p><p></p><p>You can't guarantee that everyone you encounter will be a bad person, but if you do encounter a bad person, they may put you in mortal danger.</p><p></p><p>His current strength is still not enough, so the smartest thing to do before he can fully protect himself is to hide his identity and develop quietly.</p><p></p><p>Anyway, he can now find many resources on his own, and he is not the type of person who likes to show off, so he will just maintain the current situation.</p><p></p><p>"Ye Xiao, I've heard some rumors that Ning Zhiyuan and the others are petitioning together, wanting the elders of the Xuanuan Clan to intervene and prevent you two from dueling, so I want to discuss this with you.</p><p></p><p>Can you not fight with Cloud Xuanuan?</p><p></p><p>You two are the proud sons of the Xuanuan Clan, the future of the Xuanuan Clan. If nothing unexpected happens, in the future you two will both become God Emperor level existences.</p><p></p><p>If either of you suffers a mishap, it would be a major loss for the Xuanuan Clan."</p><p></p><p>After a pause, he spoke again:</p><p></p><p>"I know your talent is monstrous, and I know you are progressing very quickly. But do you know? Cloud Xuanuan's strength has already reached the ninth level of the Deicide Realm! And he's only 61 years old! Even if you're as monstrous as you are, you won't be able to reach this level in half a year, right? So I'm very worried about you."</p><p></p><p>Ye Xiao was somewhat surprised. Although he had thought that Cloud Xuanuan's cultivation had probably reached the late Deicide Realm, he didn't expect his speed to be so fast.</p><p></p><p>But thinking about it carefully, from the moment he was born, he had always been given the best resources by the Xuanuan Clan.</p><p></p><p>His conditions were far more superior than his own.</p><p></p><p>And he had also cultivated for a full 61 years.</p><p></p><p>This speed might be countless times stronger than the Azure Dragon Sword Sovereign, but compared to him, it was still a little lacking.</p><p></p><p>Because now, at most, he had only cultivated for a little more than four years.</p><p></p><p>Not to mention the difference in resources, even the cultivation time was more than 10 times less than Cloud Xuanuan's.</p><p></p><p>Thinking this way, the last bit of interest Ye Xiao had in challenging him disappeared.</p><p></p><p>He shrugged his shoulders.</p><p></p><p>"I actually don't care. When I challenged him back then, it was only because I felt he was sheltering Cloud Shui, and wasn't a good person. Now that I know it was a misunderstanding, I don't need to be stubborn and fight him!"</p><p></p><p>Hearing these words, the Jing Emperor immediately let out a sigh of relief, and a smile appeared on his face.</p><p></p><p>He knew that Ye Xiao was still clear-minded.</p><p></p><p>"By the way, why do you have time to come here today? I can feel that most of the Ning family seem to have gone to the starry sky. Has something happened up there in the starry sky?"</p><p></p><p>"That's right, four divine king tombs have been discovered in the starry sky."</p><p></p><p>Ye Xiao: "!!"</p><p></p><p>One more, three thousand.</p><p></p><p>Thank you for the recommendation, and thank you for the monthly vote.</p><p></p><p>Thank you to book friend K Y for the reward, I am very grateful.</p><p></p><p>(This chapter is complete)</p>

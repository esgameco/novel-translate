        <h1>Chapter 240</h1>
        <div class="content">
            <p>Here is the full English translation of the Chinese excerpt:</p><p></p><p>However, upon further reflection, there was no real need for that.</p><p></p><p>Because a person's innate talent is limited, and time is also limited. Within the constraints of limited talent and time, trying to maximize one's own strength is best achieved by cultivating a single, or at most two, imperial arts!"</p><p></p><p>After saying this, Beitang Ce suddenly fell silent.</p><p></p><p>Because he had just thought of a problem.</p><p></p><p>The two points he had just made, whether it was about innate talent or cultivation time, only applied to "ordinary people"! Even the geniuses among ordinary people could not possibly cultivate multiple imperial arts at once.</p><p></p><p>As for Ye Xiao, well, he could no longer be considered human.</p><p></p><p>If it weren't for the fact that he was undoubtedly human, Beitang Ce might have even suspected that Ye Xiao was a spy sent by the Star Beast Sect. And his identity might even be that of a Star Beast Prince or the like.</p><p></p><p>Ye Xiao, on the other hand, was not thinking so much. He was only thinking about how to refine more imperial arts and then use them to synthesize even more powerful cultivation methods.</p><p></p><p>For ordinary people, extracting imperial arts from master-level cultivation methods would be very difficult.</p><p></p><p>But for an existence like himself, who had already synthesized all the basic cultivation methods, it was not a problem at all.</p><p></p><p>He was completely clear about the origins of these cultivation methods. Just by taking a glance, he could roughly distinguish the differences between them, and then by linking the same methods together, he could easily find an imperial art.</p><p></p><p>Moreover, with the help of a spiritual cultivation method like Taixuan Tiangong, it became even easier.</p><p></p><p>After solving the issue of cultivation methods, Ye Xiao opened the two imperial arts in his hand and took a careful look.</p><p></p><p>Unfortunately, they were both of the type that the Golden Book of the Spirit had already recorded.</p><p></p><p>One was a sword technique, and the other was a mind cultivation method similar to the Dharma Sutra.</p><p></p><p>He returned the two imperial art manuals to Beitang Ce.</p><p></p><p>Beitang Ce then said:</p><p></p><p>"Actually, there is still a way. If you really want more imperial arts, you can go to the Star Battlefield and hunt Star Beasts."</p><p></p><p>Ye Xiao: "(_..)!"</p><p></p><p>This method was as good as not saying anything at all.</p><p></p><p>Didn't he know that going to the Star Battlefield would encounter many Dragon-level bloodline Star Beasts, from which imperial arts could be extracted? But it was not that easy. Ye Xiao was only at the half-step Monarch Realm, not even a true Monarch yet. On the ground, he could barely be considered a top expert, but in the Star Battlefield, there would be many stronger than him.</p><p></p><p>If he really encountered some top-tier experts, it would be very dangerous.</p><p></p><p>At least he would have to wait until his cultivation broke through to the Emperor Realm before considering going to the Star Battlefield, right?</p><p></p><p>"I'll think about it. Since there are no more imperial arts here, I won't bother you further. I'll be returning to Jianghai City tomorrow, and we can meet again in the future if there's a chance!"</p><p></p><p>Ye Xiao politely took his leave, and Beitang Ce nodded.</p><p></p><p>Afterwards, Ye Xiao went downstairs to look through some books.</p><p></p><p>He found some roughly similar master-level cultivation methods, then scanned them with his spiritual power to extract their essence.</p><p></p><p>Sure enough, he managed to produce the beginning of an imperial-level cultivation method.</p><p></p><p>Although he didn't know if the method he had synthesized himself would be of a different source from the imperial arts he already possessed, allowing him to synthesize even more powerful cultivation methods, at least this was a very good start. It proved the feasibility of this method.</p><p></p><p>In the future, after returning to Jianghai City, he could also use this method to find more imperial arts, as there must be some imperial arts that could be recorded into his spiritual sea, right?</p><p></p><p>When that time comes, synthesizing even more powerful cultivation methods would be a piece of cake. Perfect!</p><p></p><p>With the source of imperial arts resolved, the oppressive feeling that had been weighing on Ye Xiao's heart immediately dissipated, and his mood brightened significantly.</p><p></p><p>It was like finding a ray of hope in the sunlight.</p><p></p><p>The next step would be to figure out how to obtain more energy to enhance his own strength.</p><p></p><p>Relying solely on consuming Star Beast flesh would not be enough to easily reach the Monarch Realm.</p><p></p><p>Because the amount of cultivation required for the Monarch Realm is simply too vast! That vast cultivation gap cannot be easily filled just by eating the flesh of Star Beasts at the same level.</p><p></p><p>Consuming Star Beast flesh is far inferior to taking pills refined from entire Star Beasts, but even eating several pills refined from the same level Star Beast would not directly lead to a realm advancement.</p><p></p><p>Otherwise, anyone could easily advance to the Monarch Realm.</p><p></p><p>Therefore, Ye Xiao needed to find a place with heavenly materials and earthly treasures, like the Wanziqu Leaves.</p><p></p><p>The books from the Central Continent, in addition to the martial arts cultivation methods he needed, also contained a lot of miscellaneous information, including many rumors about hidden treasures.</p><p></p><p>From some of the higher-level materials, Ye Xiao saw that there were many treasure troves hidden in the vast and fertile lands of the Nine Provinces.</p><p></p><p>He randomly picked a few that caught his interest, the most notable being the legendary Nine Provinces Dragon Vein.</p><p></p><p>The Nine Provinces Dragon Vein was said to be the repository of the essence of the entire Nine Provinces, nourished by the sun, moon, and the gathering of the earth's qi, forming a treasure trove.</p><p></p><p>That kind of treasure trove would contain extremely powerful heavenly and earthly spiritual energy.</p><p></p><p>If he could find it and cultivate there, he could easily become an unparalleled expert.</p><p></p><p>But according to the legends, the Nine Provinces Dragon Vein was...</p><p></p><p>Here is the full English translation of the Chinese novel excerpt:</p><p></p><p>Centuries ago, an emperor, in order to prevent anyone from coveting his domain, specially ordered one of his divine masters to sever all the dragon veins in the land. </p><p></p><p>This is why it has been difficult for an emperor to rise in the Nine Provinces in the past few centuries.</p><p></p><p>Even those with imperial bloodlines ultimately could not become emperor.</p><p></p><p>However, it is rumored that the divine master secretly left one dragon vein intact, leaving a seed for the Nine Provinces. But whether this is true or not, no one knows for sure.</p><p></p><p>Now, there are some noble families who, in order to enhance the power of their descendants, deliberately create artificial dragon veins using ancient methods.</p><p></p><p>These artificial dragon veins are also very potent. While not as powerful as the genuine dragon veins, they still possess tremendous spiritual energy.</p><p></p><p>If one can cultivate within them, one's strength can increase exponentially compared to cultivating outside.</p><p></p><p>Ye Xiao thought to himself, "If only I could find that sole remaining dragon vein, my cultivation would skyrocket. I might even be able to reach the Monarch Realm in just a few days."</p><p></p><p>Of course, this was just an "if" - if it were truly that easy to find, others would have discovered it as well.</p><p></p><p>So Ye Xiao decided not to consider this option for now.</p><p></p><p>Instead, he turned his attention to another place - the Heavenly Demon Cliff.</p><p></p><p>It is said that this was an ancient battlefield where powerful martial artists fought against mighty celestial beasts, with both sides suffering heavy casualties. Ultimately, the martial artists slew the powerful celestial beasts on the Heavenly Demon Cliff.</p><p></p><p>This is why the Heavenly Demon Cliff is now filled with demonic energy and the resentment of the slain beasts, creating an environment highly unsuitable for human existence. Even powerful cultivators would risk their lives venturing inside.</p><p></p><p>However, it is precisely because of this that many celestial beasts now lurk within, and rare heavenly treasures can be found there as well.</p><p></p><p>Previously, the Demon God Sect expert Dragon Slayer, after being defeated by the Sword Immortal Li Liushui, had entered the Heavenly Demon Cliff to cultivate in seclusion for a long time before finally emerging, his strength significantly enhanced.</p><p></p><p>This shows that the Heavenly Demon Cliff indeed contains valuable resources.</p><p></p><p>"The Heavenly Demon Cliff seems quite promising. If Dragon Slayer could thrive there, I should be able to as well," Ye Xiao thought.</p><p></p><p>After all, he had slain Dragon Slayer as easily as cutting vegetables, and his cultivation was only at the early Ninth Realm of the Xiantian stage back then. Now he was at the half-Monarch Realm - many times stronger than the former Dragon Slayer.</p><p></p><p>The Heavenly Demon Cliff, unlike the Starry Sky Battlefield, surely could not contain any Monarch Realm experts, right?</p><p></p><p>Furthermore, the Zhongzhou City where he was located was quite close to the Heavenly Demon Cliff, situated in the eastern part of Zhongzhou, while the Cliff was in the southeastern border region between Zhongzhou, Chuzhou, and Qinzhou.</p><p></p><p>Tomorrow, he would first send Yang Qian and the others back, as they would not need to report to work immediately after returning.</p><p></p><p>He would then head to the Heavenly Demon Cliff to see if he could find valuable resources there to further enhance his cultivation and break through the final barrier to reach the Monarch Realm.</p><p></p><p>Thinking this, he sent a message to Yang Qian, telling them to leave first without waiting for him.</p><p></p><p>Afterwards, he immediately set off for the Heavenly Demon Cliff, activating the Divine Will Incantation. For him, the distance was merely a matter of a few breaths.</p><p></p><p>In the blink of an eye, he arrived at the Heavenly Demon Cliff. </p><p></p><p>The scenery had changed in an instant. On the Heavenly Demon Cliff, the cold wind was biting, even though it was only early autumn and not yet true winter. </p><p></p><p>The sun was still high in the sky, around 3 pm, but an icy chill permeated the area.</p><p></p><p>This was due to the overwhelming demonic energy and resentment that saturated the Heavenly Demon Cliff.</p><p></p><p>Normally, this malevolent force should have been concentrated underground, but it had grown so dense that it now affected the surrounding land. Even the cliffs were imbued with this icy, sinister power.</p><p></p><p>As Ye Xiao approached the edge of the Heavenly Demon Cliff and glanced down, he was immediately assaulted by an intense murderous aura, as if the entire Cliff was a gaping black maw ready to swallow him whole like a tiny tadpole.</p><p></p><p>He could clearly sense that despite the desolate appearance, the Heavenly Demon Cliff concealed countless living beings within.</p><p></p><p>No wonder Dragon Slayer had been able to seclude himself there for decades, emerging with greatly enhanced cultivation.</p><p></p><p>(End of translation)</p>

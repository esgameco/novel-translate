        <h1>Chapter 33</h1>
        <div class="content">
            <p>Here is the full English translation of the Chinese excerpt:</p><p></p><p>"Why did your grandfather suddenly come back? Is there something important?"</p><p></p><p>"No, it's just about that Hanzhou's Pak Seon-saeng. His teacher, the Hanzhou Sword Saint Ryu Seung-sun, may come over in a while. It seems he wants to find a high-level swordsman in our Ganghai City and have a decisive battle."</p><p></p><p>Ye Xiao: "???"</p><p></p><p>What's the problem? What does it have to do with him? He just slew an evil spirit that was harming the common people, and accidentally left behind a sword mark. At most, it could be considered as damaging public property.</p><p></p><p>Now it has even drawn the targeting of the Hanzhou Sword Saint Ryu Seung-sun!!!</p><p></p><p>Ye Xiao has heard of Ryu Seung-sun's reputation before.</p><p></p><p>Even before Pak Seon-saeng was going to come, there were already posts on the forums about Ryu Seung-sun's exploits.</p><p></p><p>If he remembered correctly, this Ryu Seung-sun should be a divine-level expert, right? They say good deeds will be rewarded, but the heavens sure do love to play tricks.</p><p></p><p>"Oh right, my grandfather has already left. Do you still want to continue reading the books?"</p><p></p><p>Qin Yuyan spoke again, and Ye Xiao shook his head.</p><p></p><p>He read books very quickly, and had basically gone through all of Qin Shenglong's collection.</p><p></p><p>Of course, he wouldn't say that outright.</p><p></p><p>"No need, in case your grandfather comes back, it might be hard to explain."</p><p></p><p>Qin Yuyan's face flushed slightly red.</p><p></p><p>"That's true, I've never brought a boy home before, so I didn't think about how to handle this kind of situation. Today was quite fortunate."</p><p></p><p>"Then I'll take my leave first, goodbye."</p><p></p><p>"Mm!"</p><p></p><p>After bidding farewell, Ye Xiao carried the Illusion Crystal and unhurriedly walked out of the Qin family's residence. Once out of sight, he directly threw the Illusion Crystal to the ground.</p><p></p><p>Thud!</p><p></p><p>The Illusion Crystal fell with a loud crash.</p><p></p><p>"Meow~ Master, that's too much. I was almost asleep."</p><p></p><p>"Scram, walk on your own."</p><p></p><p>Ye Xiao couldn't be bothered to indulge this old slippery cat, and Illusion Crystal could only follow behind leisurely.</p><p></p><p>The moment he left Qin Yuyan, he missed her, missed the Papaya-branded love sofa! After returning to his residence, Ye Xiao waited until night, and the spiritual cultivation technique he had finally reached the great perfection realm.</p><p></p><p>The seven spiritual cultivation technique imprints began to emit a golden glow.</p><p>This signified that they could now be fused.</p><p></p><p>Ye Xiao immediately closed all doors and windows, having Illusion Crystal guard the courtyard to prevent any disturbances or discoveries.</p><p></p><p>The divine book of the spirit quickly began to fuse the spiritual cultivation techniques.</p><p></p><p>The seven basic techniques manifested into seven golden large characters.</p><p></p><p>"What's the pronunciation of the last character?"</p><p></p><p>Ye Xiao furrowed his brows, as an unfamiliar character appeared on the paper.</p><p></p><p>Never mind, the fusion is the divine book's work, he just needs to lie down and it will handle it.</p><p></p><p>Soon, the fusion was completely finished, the entire process taking less than ten minutes.</p><p></p><p>An extremely special spiritual cultivation technique appeared, with a rather domineering name.</p><p></p><p>The Grand Celestial Empyrean!</p><p></p><p>A technique that perfectly matched Ye Xiao's temperament, exuding an extremely arrogant aura!</p><p></p><p>Of course, joking aside, Ye Xiao did recognize the value of this technique.</p><p></p><p>It possesses the ability to enhance, integrate, combat, defend, attack, disorient, and even modify the will - a whole array of incredibly powerful spiritual force applications.</p><p></p><p>Its capabilities are not inferior to any of Ye Xiao's current techniques.</p><p></p><p>Here is my translation of the Chinese excerpt:</p><p></p><p>The Sword of Heavenly Slaughter and other powerful attack techniques can enhance one's cultivation, but they cannot absorb or replenish spiritual energy.</p><p></p><p>The Purple Thorn Star Sea is a technique for large-scale absorption of spiritual energy, and it can also improve one's cultivation, but it cannot be used for attack.</p><p></p><p>These techniques have relatively narrow conditions for use. In contrast, the Profound Heavenly Might technique can not only attack, but also defend, improve one's spiritual cultivation, and replenish expended spiritual power. </p><p></p><p>It is almost like having a collection of various monstrous abilities all in one. Ye Xiao dares to say that there are probably not many such comprehensive spiritual techniques in this world.</p><p></p><p>"Right now I have cultivated two powerful physical attack techniques, one sword and one blade. I have also cultivated a spiritual technique and a heart cultivation method.</p><p></p><p>Compared to others at the same level, my abilities should be stronger than the average martial cultivator.</p><p></p><p>However, I still have some weaknesses.</p><p></p><p>One is my defensive capability. I have not been able to properly develop my defenses, which is not suitable. If we get into a fight, even if I'm strong, if someone hits me with a sneak attack, I won't be able to withstand it. Then all my offensive power would be for naught."</p><p></p><p>Because in this world, it's not just Ye Xiao who is a martial arts master. There may be others like the sect leader Liu Chengxun who could pose a threat.</p><p></p><p>Even if Ye Xiao tries to cultivate quietly without provoking anyone, he knows he may still be targeted. He cannot be careless.</p><p></p><p>"But even if I can't find a foundational body tempering technique to create a complete defensive system, I can consider forging some armor for myself as protection. </p><p></p><p>Oh, and I can also forge weapons to enhance my combat ability!"</p><p></p><p>Battles between martial artists are not like old women fighting. One mistake could mean life or death, so he must prepare thoroughly.</p><p></p><p>"In addition, I should consider cultivating a movement technique."</p><p></p><p>Masters can indeed run very fast, even faster than Ye Xiao's current abilities. But their speed has limits, just like a car has a maximum speed that it cannot exceed, and it consumes a lot of energy.</p><p></p><p>In a battle, using this kind of fleeing method not only drains spiritual energy, but may not even allow one to outrun the stronger opponents.</p><p></p><p>Ye Xiao can currently only run at under 300 km/h for an hour, and even with the support of the Purple Thorn Star Sea technique, he may not be able to sustain that for long. </p><p></p><p>Moreover, he may not be able to outrun some advanced technological equipment.</p><p></p><p>A movement technique can greatly reduce the consumption of spiritual energy while also providing acceleration.</p><p></p><p>This would give unexpected advantages in combat, escape, rescue, and surprise attacks.</p><p></p><p>So he must cultivate a movement technique.</p><p></p><p>Just then, a loud knocking suddenly came from Ye Xiao's door.</p><p></p><p>"Tenant, open up! It's the landlord, I have something to discuss with you."</p><p></p><p>Ye Xiao's brow furrowed. </p><p></p><p>"Why would the landlord come at this time?"</p><p></p><p>Puzzled, he shook his head and went to open the door.</p>

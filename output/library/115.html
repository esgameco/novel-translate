        <h1>Chapter 115</h1>
        <div class="content">
            <p>Here is the full English translation of the Chinese excerpt:</p><p></p><p>Ye Xiao swept through the other party's memories, feeling somewhat surprised.</p><p></p><p>He clearly did not expect that the other party was actually wounded by the young Weiwu from the Silver Fox Clan.</p><p></p><p>After seeing the enmity between the Silver Fox Clan and humans, he did not want to say much more.</p><p></p><p>It's the same old story - a human and a beast-like creature fall in love, unwavering until death, but the law does not allow it, blah blah blah, making it seem like a Liaozhai tale.</p><p></p><p>However, as he scanned through Du Changfeng's memories, Ye Xiao grasped a piece of knowledge he had not understood before.</p><p></p><p>This was something not found in books, something Du Changfeng had obtained through researching ancient texts during his time as a professor at the Jingdu Martial Arts University - an extremely secretive incident.</p><p></p><p>It was the root cause of the opposition between the human race and the beast-like creatures.</p><p></p><p>It turned out that in the universe, the race with the highest innate talent was not the beast-like creatures, but the humans!</p><p></p><p>The beast-like creatures, although born with exceptional bloodlines, do not need cultivation. They can easily break through the bottleneck by simply growing older and devouring other beast-like creatures to continuously enhance their strength.</p><p></p><p>However, the bloodline is both their strength and weakness.</p><p></p><p>Due to their bloodline, the beast-like creatures are inherently limited in their peak potential.</p><p></p><p>Unless they can devour the existence with the strongest bloodline to change their own bloodline limits, they cannot further improve. Once they reach a certain age limit, they will die.</p><p></p><p>But the beast-like creatures with stronger bloodlines also mean their strength will be greater than their own. So this method is almost impossible to succeed.</p><p></p><p>Furthermore, the beast-like creatures can only use the abilities contained within their own bloodline.</p><p></p><p>Humans, on the other hand, are different.</p><p></p><p>Humans can acquire the abilities of the beast-like creatures through learning.</p><p></p><p>For example, humans can cultivate sword techniques or knife techniques. Although the human spiritual soul has different forms, it only plays an auxiliary role and does not determine the direction of cultivation.</p><p></p><p>Therefore, the beast-like creatures will devour humans to obtain the abilities that humans have learned, and there are also methods like the half-beast humans to acquire human abilities.</p><p></p><p>This is also why humans strictly prohibit the union between humans and beast-like creatures.</p><p></p><p>The ultimate fate of the half-beast humans will be assimilated by the beast-like creatures. Once the beast-like creatures acquire human methods, it will be a great disaster for humans.</p><p></p><p>In short, humans and beast-like creatures each have their own needs.</p><p></p><p>Humans need the beast-like creatures to refine cultivation techniques, concoct elixirs, and forge weapons.</p><p></p><p>The beast-like creatures need humans to acquire learning abilities.</p><p></p><p>This has led to the two sides inevitably becoming opposing enemies.</p><p></p><p>"Senior."</p><p></p><p>Du Changfeng called out to Ye Xiao cautiously.</p><p></p><p>Ye Xiao snapped out of his thoughts and did not speak, but with a snap of his fingers, he cast the Supplementing the Heavens technique to help Du Changfeng heal his injuries.</p><p></p><p>Du Changfeng was a good person who had contributed a lot to Jianghai City and had also taught many outstanding students in the Nine Prefectures.</p><p></p><p>Moreover, he was a great master himself and could make many contributions to the Nine Prefectures.</p><p></p><p>Casting the Supplementing the Heavens technique was a trivial matter for Ye Xiao, so he simply lent a hand.</p><p></p><p>After casting the technique, Ye Xiao spoke calmly:</p><p></p><p>"I am in seclusion in Jianghai City and do not wish to be overly noticed by others."</p><p></p><p>Before Du Changfeng could respond, he was enveloped in a warm force, and he felt his injuries being rapidly healed, restored to perfect condition in the blink of an eye.</p><p></p><p>"Such a powerful healing technique!" </p><p></p><p>Du Changfeng was utterly amazed. The level of this healing technique was simply extraordinary, the strongest and most supreme he had ever seen. For a great master's injuries to be healed in an instant was truly astonishing.</p><p></p><p>He had heard rumors about a high-level healer in Jianghai City, and now, seeing this, he realized that the rumors were true.</p><p></p><p>Here is the full English translation of the Chinese excerpt:</p><p></p><p>Ah, he is a high-level healer! This can be said to be a top-tier healer.</p><p></p><p>Not only in the entire Nine Provinces, but even if you put him on a global scale, he would still be dazzlingly brilliant.</p><p></p><p>The number of healers is extremely scarce compared to martial artists, let alone those with exceptional talents.</p><p></p><p>Moreover, he also cultivates the martial way and has reached the pinnacle of it.</p><p></p><p>Dou Chang felt that during his time at the Jingdu Martial Arts University, he had never encountered such an existence!<div class="contentadv"><script>loadAdv(7,3);</script></div>By the time he reacted, Ye Xiao had already left.</p><p></p><p>Looking at the spot where Ye Xiao had just stood, he couldn't help but sigh:</p><p></p><p>"He is truly a divine being!"</p><p></p><p>After a pause, his expression turned solemn.</p><p></p><p>"Senior, don't worry, with me here, the news of you in Jianghai City will definitely not spread on a large scale."</p><p></p><p>On Ye Xiao's side, he had already returned to the ground.</p><p></p><p>The increase in his cultivation has given him more confidence in confronting the Aier King.</p><p></p><p>Thinking about the Aier King's robust, muscular physique, he couldn't help but swallow a few times.</p><p></p><p>Tendons and muscles are the most delicious, with a good bite, rich in blood and nutrients.</p><p></p><p>Frying, deep-frying, boiling, stewing, stir-frying, baking, pickling, and marinating - he couldn't stop thinking about it and now wanted to go buy a few catties of beef and mutton.</p><p></p><p>At this moment, Wang Dalong's text message came, saying that the black obsidian had been collected, and Ye Xiao could go and get it anytime.</p><p></p><p>Ye Xiao sent him a text message in reply and then headed to the agreed location.</p><p></p><p>On Dou Chang's side, he also quickly descended, and Dou Tianyu immediately rushed over.</p><p></p><p>"Uncle, have you seen that extraordinary person?"</p><p></p><p>Dou Chang smiled and nodded.</p><p></p><p>"I have seen him."</p><p></p><p>"What does he look like?"</p><p></p><p>Dou Chang: "(Sigh)!"</p><p></p><p>Seeing the expectant expression on Dou Tianyu's face, he cleared his throat and looked into the distance with a deep gaze.</p><p></p><p>"He has white hair and beard, wearing a long robe of Tian Can silk, like a transcendent immortal, detached from the mundane world!"</p><p></p><p>"Whew!"</p><p></p><p>Dou Tianyu couldn't help but take a deep breath, then nodded solemnly.</p><p></p><p>"Indeed, he is a supreme high-ranking figure. Only an immortal can match his transcendent image above the mortal realm!"</p><p></p><p>"His cultivation has reached the level of controlling the heavens and the earth, far beyond what you and I can imagine. I guess he has already entered the Divine Sect."</p><p></p><p>Although he is not ranked on the World Dragon Ranking, his cultivation may not be weaker than those top-ranked experts.</p><p></p><p>Dou Tianyu was shocked. "That powerful?"</p><p></p><p>After all, there are not just fifty people in the global Divine Sect, but only fifty people have made it onto the Dragon Ranking.</p><p></p><p>Dou Chang nodded solemnly.</p><p></p><p>"With just a snap of his fingers, he completely healed the injuries I sustained from the Silver Fox Clan's Eldest Miss Weiwei. And it was an instant recovery. Do you think there are many on the Dragon Ranking who can achieve such a feat?"</p><p></p><p>"My goodness!"</p><p></p><p>Dou Tianyu was completely dumbfounded.</p><p></p><p>"This senior is so terrifying?"</p><p></p><p>"However, he specifically instructed me that he is only in seclusion in Jianghai City and does not want others to disturb his life."</p><p></p><p>As he said this, Dou Chang raised his chin slightly, filled with a sense of pride and mission.</p><p></p><p>After all, this was the instruction given by that senior high-ranking figure in person.</p><p></p><p>In the entire Jianghai City, besides him, who else could have this honor?</p>

        <h1>Chapter 219</h1>
        <div class="content">
            <p>Here is the full English translation of the Chinese excerpt:</p><p></p><p>After being pushed back by Ye Xiao's punch, Noel Fis immediately revealed his true form.</p><p></p><p>Facing a human cultivator at the innate ninth realm, he knew he couldn't afford to be careless. He had to go all out and crush the opponent.</p><p></p><p>His terrifying combat power was fully displayed in that instant.</p><p></p><p>Eight towering tentacles lashed out towards Ye Xiao from eight different directions simultaneously. This was the fearsome aspect of Noel Fis - he could unleash eight attacks at once.</p><p></p><p>Although each individual attack might not reach the full power of the innate ninth realm, the combined force of the eight attacks far exceeded a single full-power strike from an innate ninth realm expert.</p><p></p><p>Boom! The eight massive tentacles collided, creating a shockwave that rippled out in a giant circle, instantly killing all the birds within a hundred-mile radius.</p><p></p><p>However, while Noel Fis' attack was powerful, Ye Xiao's speed was no slouch either. Activating his divine intent technique, he was able to evade the attack completely unharmed.</p><p></p><p>In the next moment, Ye Xiao appeared above Noel Fis and brought down his sword, severing two of the giant tentacles and storing them in his storage ring.</p><p></p><p>The intense pain shot through Noel Fis' body, causing him agonizing torment. But in the midst of battle, he had no way to escape.</p><p></p><p>When brave men meet, the victor prevails; the one who flees dies the quickest.</p><p></p><p>"Roar!" The massive octopus-like body let out a furious bellow, the powerful soundwaves causing excruciating pain to the ears of countless people in the nearby Jianghai City.</p><p></p><p>At this moment, Ye Xiao had closed in on Noel Fis.</p><p></p><p>But just then, an unexpected event occurred.</p><p></p><p>Suddenly, a thick black mist sprayed out from Noel Fis' mouth. And at the same time, a sinister, triumphant smile appeared on the giant octopus face.</p><p></p><p>As a soft-bodied creature, losing two tentacles was of little consequence to him. The pain meant nothing.</p><p></p><p>His previous display had just been an act, a ploy to lure Ye Xiao in close.</p><p></p><p>Noel Fis knew he couldn't match Ye Xiao's speed from a distance, he had no way to even touch the edge of Ye Xiao's clothes. Close quarters was the only way.</p><p></p><p>But even in close combat, success was not guaranteed against Ye Xiao's terrifying speed.</p><p></p><p>However, Noel Fis had one more trick - the Ink Mist Art! This was an innate ability of his kind, allowing him to spew out ink when in danger.</p><p></p><p>This ink contained a potent soul toxin. While it wouldn't harm the physical body, it would have a severe effect on the soul. In a short time, the soul's movements would become sluggish, and for those weaker than the user, it could even lead to unconsciousness or death.</p><p></p><p>Ye Xiao's strength meant he wouldn't die or fall unconscious, but he would be greatly impaired, severely hampering his mobility. And that would be enough.</p><p></p><p>This technique was Noel Fis' trump card, only used when he couldn't escape or when facing a powerful enemy he needed to eliminate decisively.</p><p></p><p>That Ye Xiao had forced him to use this move was already a great honor.</p><p></p><p>"Human! Now die!" Noel Fis sneered, unleashing his remaining six tentacles in a full-force attack.</p><p></p><p>Boom! The deafening explosion rang out once more.</p><p></p><p>This time, Noel Fis was truly going all-out, and although he had lost two tentacles, the power of this strike was still formidable.</p><p></p><p>Surely this would be enough to finish off Ye Xiao?</p><p></p><p>However, the triumphant smile on Noel Fis' face quickly froze and vanished, replaced by sheer horror.</p><p></p><p>His bulging eyes stared at Ye Xiao in disbelief.</p><p></p><p>"Impossible! How is this possible?"</p><p></p><p>His six tentacles had failed to crush Ye Xiao as expected, but had instead been firmly withstood.</p><p></p><p>How could this human's physique be so strong?</p><p></p><p>Noel Fis recognized the golden glow emanating from Ye Xiao's body - he was cultivating the Tempering Body Art!</p><p></p><p>Not only was this human fast and powerful in attack, he had also mastered the Tempering Body Art?</p><p></p><p>What was going on? How was he supposed to deal with this?</p><p></p><p>Before Noel Fis could fully process his shock, he was hit with another bombshell.</p><p></p><p>Despite the slight paralysis to his soul, Ye Xiao's three healing arts had activated simultaneously, instantly treating his injuries and dispelling the negative effects.</p><p></p><p>"Healing arts? You've even learned healing arts?" Noel Fis shrieked.</p><p></p><p>It was no wonder he was so stunned - Ye Xiao's techniques and abilities were simply too numerous and powerful.</p><p></p><p>Even human cultivators could only focus on mastering one or two martial arts at most, as the human talent was limited.</p><p></p><p>But this Ye Xiao before him...</p><p></p><p>His strength was formidable, and his repertoire of skills was absurdly excessive! This man was truly no ordinary human.</p><p></p><p>Here is the full English translation of the Chinese excerpt:</p><p></p><p>What? Nolphius even had some doubts, was he the illegitimate son of some deity?</p><p></p><p>Ye Xiao's power deeply shocked his soul.</p><p></p><p>And in that moment of distraction, it also caused an irreparable cost.</p><p></p><p>Recovering, Ye Xiao instantly released hundreds of sword beams.</p><p></p><p>Imperial Extreme Sword Technique!</p><p></p><p>Boom, boom, boom...</p><p></p><p>The powerful sword lights, one stronger than the other.</p><p></p><p>"Noâ€”!" Nolphius let out a heart-wrenching scream.</p><p></p><p>When all hundred sword beams were unleashed, Nolphius' remaining six arms were completely severed by Ye Xiao.</p><p></p><p>And his main body, having suffered a heavy blow, completely fainted.</p><p></p><p>Ye Xiao grabbed him with a big hand and directly stored him in the spatial ring.</p><p></p><p>At this time, some auras were approaching from below.</p><p></p><p>They were several Saint Sovereign experts from the Jianghai City, wanting to see who it was.</p><p></p><p>Unfortunately, Ye Xiao had already finished the battle and directly left by using the Divine Will Technique.</p><p></p><p>In the sealed space, Saimuel was already fighting with the other spirit beasts.</p><p></p><p>He was making an impassioned mobilization, urging everyone to be more enthusiastic and proactive, and work together to find a way to escape from here.</p><p></p><p>"We absolutely cannot give up so easily, the difficulties are only temporary, we still have a chance.</p><p></p><p>If we give up like this, and the Tiger God hasn't discovered our situation, we have to stay here for at least six thousand years! That's a full six thousand years! Six thousand years, although it's not long for us spirit beasts.</p><p></p><p>But within the entire six thousand years, we have to survive in this small space.</p><p></p><p>We are all Saint Sovereign spirit beasts, the elites among spirit beasts.</p><p></p><p>How can we tolerate this humiliation?</p><p></p><p>And don't forget, we are now his livestock, if he's unhappy, he can kill us with a single stroke at any time.</p><p></p><p>Or use our flesh and blood to directly refine elixirs!</p><p></p><p>Swear to resist the oppression of the human race, as long as we have a breath left, we must fight the evil human race to the end! Brothers, persevere! Victory belongs to us.</p><p></p><p>Long live the spirit beasts!"</p><p></p><p>The crowd was inspired by his words, their eyes shining with starlight!</p><p></p><p>As if they really saw the day when they would escape from this seal.</p><p></p><p>But Nolphius was just sitting in the corner, leisurely watching them.</p><p></p><p>Actually listening to this fool's nonsense, these spirit beasts really have no brains!</p><p></p><p>You strengthen your strength, does that mean Ye Xiao is just an idle eater?</p><p></p><p>He won't cultivate and break through, right!</p><p></p><p>Now that he Ye Xiao is just at the Innate Ninth-Grade realm, the reason he is keeping them is just because he currently lacks the strength.</p><p></p><p>If he breaks through this cultivation, or if he wants to break through but lacks the powerful spiritual energy to support it, what then? At that time, he is very likely to refine all the spirit beasts present into elixirs.</p><p></p><p>To help him break through the current realm.</p><p></p><p>This is a problem that Nolphius has just thought of recently.</p><p></p><p>So he has decided to just lie down and do nothing.</p><p></p><p>Break the seal? Of course not, the main reason is that his main body is in the Shaolin Martial Arts Academy.</p><p></p><p>He doesn't need to worry about this problem at all now.</p><p></p><p>If Ye Xiao kills them all, he has his main body to survive, he won't perish in this world.</p><p></p><p>But Saimuel and the others are different, if they die, that's true death.</p><p></p><p>Forget it.</p><p></p><p>What does it have to do with me?</p><p></p><p>As long as I'm alive, that's fine.</p><p></p><p>Lie down, watch the show, enjoy it!</p><p></p><p>Just make a living day by day.</p><p></p><p>However, at this moment, Ye Xiao's figure suddenly appeared in this space.</p><p></p><p>After sensing his aura, the originally passionately giving the speech Saimuel immediately stopped his voice.</p><p></p><p>Can't help it, this guy is a monster! Can't beat him in a fight, can only cower and wait to escape later.</p><p></p><p>He gave a look, and the other spirit beasts immediately scattered!</p><p></p><p>Of course, Ye Xiao knew what they were doing.</p><p></p><p>He didn't care.</p><p></p><p>If these guys could really escape from this seal, they would have escaped long ago. Why wait until now?</p><p></p><p>They think they're planning well down there, but in fact, I've been reinforcing the seal here every so often, and adding more spirit stones.</p><p></p><p>So the formation's power probably increases by a fold every so often.</p><p></p><p>And these spirit beasts are being bled and eaten by me every day, their cultivation can't improve at all, just stuck in place.</p><p></p><p>How can these spirit beasts play tricks on me?</p><p></p><p>So now, let them do whatever conspiracy, just to kill time, like watching kids play house.</p><p></p><p>As long as they can provide me with resources.</p><p></p><p>Thinking this way, Ye Xiao took out Nolphius' main body from the storage ring and released it.</p><p></p><p>Fourth update, 12,000 words.</p><p></p><p>Please recommend, vote for monthly tickets, and subscribe.</p><p></p><p>Thank you to the book friend Hangtian for the protection and reward, I am deeply grateful.</p><p></p><p>It's the last day, please give the poor little beggar a few more monthly tickets.</p><p></p><p>(This chapter is complete)</p>

        <h1>Chapter 166</h1>
        <div class="content">
            <p>Here is the full English translation of the Chinese excerpt:</p><p></p><p>"Village Head Kiyoshi is quite strong as well. Village Head Kiyoshi is not even fifty years old yet, he's only forty-nine."</p><p></p><p>"Tch! How come other people in their forties are so impressive? When I look at my own forties, it's like a joke in comparison."</p><p></p><p>Everyone, including Changfeng and the others, couldn't help but feel a sense of inferiority, yet also admiration.</p><p></p><p>They were all already in their thirties, but so far, they still hadn't broken through to the Deity Realm. Seeing the other party, they felt utterly inadequate.</p><p></p><p>"After all, he is a figure that can rank on the World Dragon Rankings, his level is truly extraordinary."</p><p></p><p>The online discussions were in an uproar over this scene.</p><p></p><p>One shocking comment after another came pouring in.</p><p></p><p>But just then, two more figures slowly flew over.</p><p></p><p>Their arrival completely ignited and detonated the entire scene.</p><p></p><p>"It's Stone Guanghao, ranked 46th on the World Dragon Rankings! The Iron Fist Stone Guanghao!"</p><p></p><p>"And Lang Xinyue, ranked 39th on the World Dragon Rankings, the Sword Saint of the Clear Wind!"</p><p></p><p>All the spectators and online viewers started getting excited.</p><p></p><p>The Nine States occupied 17 spots on the World Dragon and Phoenix Rankings. Stone Guanghao and Lang Xinyue were both among the top 50 on the Dragon Rankings.</p><p></p><p>They were also masters above the Innate Eighth Realm.</p><p></p><p>Although they were much older than Liu Chengxun and Kiyoshi, they had broken through to the Innate Eighth Realm at a younger age.</p><p></p><p>Stone Guanghao broke through at 42 years old, and Lang Xinyue at 40 years old.</p><p></p><p>At this realm, each year earlier one reaches the Innate Eighth Realm makes a huge difference in their subsequent cultivation.</p><p></p><p>The earlier one reaches the Innate Eighth Realm, the more hope they have of assaulting the legendary Innate Ninth Realm.</p><p></p><p>Their arrival was surely arranged by the Nine States to monitor Liu Chengxun and Kiyoshi, to prevent them from running amok in the Nine States' territory.</p><p></p><p>They could challenge the Sword Saint without issue, but if they dared to harm the innocent, these two would definitely intervene.</p><p></p><p>However, upon seeing these two, Liu Chengxun and Kiyoshi did not pay them much attention.</p><p></p><p>They were all in the Innate Eighth Realm, and although the two of them had reached that realm earlier, in front of them, there was no need to be overly reverent.</p><p></p><p>They could just treat them casually. The days to come were still long, and it was uncertain whether Liu Chengxun and Kiyoshi might surpass Stone Guanghao and Lang Xinyue.</p><p></p><p>But just then, the sky suddenly changed. </p><p></p><p>The clouds in the sky seemed to have turned into a crumpled sheet of paper, twisting and turning frantically.</p><p></p><p>This terrifying sight shocked countless people.</p><p></p><p>Even the four Deity Realm masters, Stone Guanghao and the others, had solemn expressions.</p><p></p><p>A supreme expert had arrived.</p><p></p><p>And the other party's power completely surpassed these Innate Eighth Realm Deity Realm masters.</p><p></p><p>Soon, the clouds stopped churning, and two figures emerged from the clouds.</p><p></p><p>One was dressed in a plain robe, the other was a young woman with a cold and beautiful appearance.</p><p></p><p>Seeing these two, Changfeng, Fazheng, and the other grand masters couldn't help but cry out in shock.</p><p></p><p>"It's him!"</p><p></p><p>All the surrounding people and the online viewers were dumbfounded.</p><p></p><p>"Who are they? Who are these two new arrivals?"</p><p></p><p>"I don't know, I've never seen them before. But if they can shock the grand masters like this, they must not be ordinary people, right?"</p><p></p><p>"Probably. After all, when Stone Deity Realm and Lang Deity Realm arrived, they didn't react this strongly. Now seeing them so agitated, almost at a loss for words, these people must be even stronger than Stone Deity Realm and Lang Deity Realm, right?"</p><p></p><p>"That's unlikely! Stone Deity Realm and Lang Deity Realm are undoubtedly Deity Realm experts! Their power is unquestionable. Ranked 46th and 39th in the world, such powerful masters, how could there be anyone stronger than them? Just how much face does Jianghai City have today?"</p><p></p><p>"It's not about how much face Jianghai City has, but how much face the Sword Saint has. These people must all be curious about the identity of the Sword Saint and have come to find him. Do you really think Jianghai City has anything that can attract them?"</p><p></p><p>"Exactly, if it weren't for the Sword Saint, these level of existences wouldn't even glance at Jianghai City, let alone come here."</p><p></p><p>However, amidst the shock, Lang Deity Realm, ranked 39th in the World, was the first to respectfully bow.</p><p></p><p>Then it was Stone Deity Realm.</p><p></p><p>After that, even the Sword Saint of the Korean State, Liu Chengxun, and the Ninjutsu Deity of the Eastern Seas, Kiyoshi, put away their previous arrogance and haughtiness, becoming respectful, almost like little lambs.</p><p></p><p>The four Deity Realm masters all cupped their fists in salute.</p><p></p><p>"Greetings, Sword Saint Lu."</p><p></p><p>This scene directly plunged the entire Jiangzhou riverbank and the entire live stream into a deathly silence.</p><p></p><p>Everyone's minds seemed to have completely stopped working.</p><p></p><p>Sword Saint Lu! The only one in the Nine States known as the Sword Saint is Lu Qingshan.</p><p></p><p>Lu Qingshan! Sword Saint Lu Qingshan! Ranked 10th on the World Dragon Rankings!</p><p></p><p>This was completely different from Lang Deity Realm and the others.</p><p></p><p>Here is the full English translation of the Chinese excerpt:</p><p></p><p>It was a level that was completely beyond them, pressing down on their heads and leaving them with no room for resistance.</p><p></p><p>"My goodness, it's actually the Sword Saint Lü Qingshan! The legendary Sword Saint of the Nine Prefectures! Wuwuwu, my lifelong dream has been fulfilled, I can die without regrets!"</p><p></p><p>"No wonder the four Divine Patriarchs were all so obedient, it's because of the Sword Saint Lü. Sword Saint Lü is the best!"</p><p></p><p>"Does the Sword Saint Lü even need his feet massaged? Little me, 82-55-92."</p><p></p><p>"Go to hell! You dare to try and get close to the Sword Saint Lü? Trying to bask in his warmth, looking for death aren't you!"</p><p></p><p>"Brainless trash! He~tui~!"</p><p></p><p>The reason why everyone was so shocked by Lü Qingshan was because he was a legend! Although this legend was not perfect, there was one person above him in the Dao of the Sword, but that person was already a legend, having surpassed the current limits of humanity.</p><p></p><p>Yet Sword Saint Lü's sword dao strength was already among the top three in the world, which was more than enough.</p><p></p><p>At thirty years old, he reached the Seventh Realm of the Divine Patriarch as an innate cultivator.</p><p>At thirty-four, he reached the Eighth Realm.</p><p>At forty, he reached the Ninth Realm, the peak of the Divine Patriarch.</p><p></p><p>Although he was now several hundred years old, this did not change the fact that he had reached the peak of the Divine Patriarch.</p><p></p><p>Because the peak of the Divine Patriarch was a dream that the vast majority of people could hardly ever achieve in their lifetime.</p><p></p><p>So even though Lang Shenzu and Liu Chengxun were still young, their future could not be guaranteed to surpass that of Sword Saint Lü.</p><p></p><p>After the Divine Patriarch, every realm was like ascending to the heavens.</p><p>The gap between each realm was enough to make one despair.</p><p>Especially after the peak of the Divine Patriarch, it was almost an impossible feat.</p><p>Otherwise, how come Lü Qingshan hadn't broken through the peak of the Divine Patriarch in the past two to three hundred years?</p><p></p><p>Lü Qingshan smiled slightly at the crowd below and said calmly:</p><p></p><p>"I have come today only to observe. You need not worry."</p><p></p><p>These words made Kamakura Hitomi and Liu Chengxun breathe a sigh of relief.</p><p>As long as the Sword Saint did not interfere, the competition could proceed.</p><p>Especially for Liu Chengxun, although he was also known as a Sword Saint, compared to Lü Qingshan, it was like comparing the Han Prefecture to the Nine Prefectures.</p><p>Although they both had the word "Prefecture" in their titles, the Nine Prefectures could easily crush the Han Prefecture's head and sit on it, with the Han Prefecture struggling in vain.</p><p>For Lü Qingshan to kill him would be as simple as crushing an ant.</p><p></p><p>The netizens' excitement continued, because even Lü Qingshan had come, this competition was worth watching even if not participating.</p><p>However, of course it would be better to watch.</p><p>After all, expecting Lü Qingshan to take action was impossible. </p><p>Lü Qingshan could single-handedly defeat the four Divine Patriarchs below, which was simply not playable.</p><p>Now, they just had to wait for the main character to arrive.</p><p>The Sword and Knife Immortal!</p><p></p><p>In the sky above, Xian'er asked confusedly:</p><p></p><p>"Master, why did you come here? It's just a small conflict between some underlings, why did you personally come to watch?"</p><p></p><p>Lü Qingshan smiled and said:</p><p></p><p>"Xian'er, you really should cultivate and nourish yourself more. The Dao of the Martial Arts is not purely about comparing the heights of one's cultivation.</p><p>Some of the most powerful sword intents may appear in people you look down upon, so you must be careful and attentive."</p><p></p><p>Then he looked down below.</p><p>In fact, he came this time just to confirm one thing.</p><p>That is, whether this Sword and Knife Immortal is the same one he saw that night.</p><p>He really wanted to find that person.</p><p>He was so eager! That person was very young, with a bone age definitely not exceeding twenty-five.</p><p>A Divine Patriarch at the Eighth Realm who hasn't even exceeded twenty-five, if he could be cultivated, his future might become the next figure to shock the world in the Nine Prefectures!</p><p>The Nine Prefectures had experienced too many Stellar Beast attacks in the past two hundred years, causing many martial arts cultures to wither and their heritage to be cut off, resulting in an overall decline in the strength of the Nine Prefectures, allowing those clowns to become more and more rampant.</p><p>If he could find that child and cultivate him, it would definitely be a blessing for the Nine Prefectures.</p><p>Enough to make the entire world tremble in fear of the Nine Prefectures.</p><p>Martial arts have no borders, but martial artists have nationalities.</p><p>If he could find that child, Lü Qingshan might even choose to pass on everything he knows to him.</p><p></p><p>But while the entire Jianghai City, even the entire Nine Prefectures, including many places in the world, with tens of billions or even hundreds of billions of people, were all waiting for Ye Xiao's appearance, Ye Xiao himself didn't even know that the other party had already arrived in Jianghai City.</p><p>At this moment, he had just arrived in Jianghai City and was answering Gu Hai's phone call.</p><p></p><p>"Hello? What? About to give birth? I understand, I'll be there right away."</p><p></p><p>Today was Lü Wanwan's due date, and Ye Xiao had said he would be the godfather of Gu Hai's child.</p>

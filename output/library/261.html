        <h1>Chapter 261</h1>
        <div class="content">
            <p>Here is the full English translation of the Chinese excerpt:</p><p></p><p>In the dazzling starry sky, atop a shooting star, two figures stood tall, gazing at the azure blue planet before them. Their eyes revealed a hint of coldness, as well as a touch of resignation.</p><p></p><p>The irises of these two figures were purple and blue, colors not typically found in human eyes. This indicated that they were not human, but rather star beasts who had cultivated to the point of taking on human form.</p><p></p><p>However, there was no sense of the murderous aura typically associated with star beasts emanating from them. It was evident that they had reached an extremely high realm of cultivation, having shed the malicious qi of star beasts and transformed into a new form of existence, much like how the human race transcends the Monarch Realm, where their physical bodies and spiritual souls undergo a profound change.</p><p></p><p>One of the figures was burly and rugged, with a resolute countenance and short hair, exuding a strong, vigorous aura.</p><p></p><p>The other figure was graceful and curvaceous, with a swan-like neck and willow-like waist, radiating a delicate and alluring beauty.</p><p></p><p>"Ahu, the auras of Qingniu and Fenglong have completely disappeared as well."</p><p></p><p>"I know."</p><p></p><p>"You shouldn't have let them go there. Although the human race in that world is at the end of its might, the dying camel is still bigger than the horse. There are still many powerful experts among them."</p><p></p><p>"Perhaps, I should go to that human world myself."</p><p></p><p>At these words, the beautiful woman's expression changed to one of alarm.</p><p></p><p>"Absolutely not! What if you encounter trouble there? Who would be able to rescue you?</p><p></p><p>The Holy War is imminent, so let's wait a little longer.</p><p></p><p>When the humans open their defenses, and we can launch a full-scale attack, we can then deal with the human race, which would be safer."</p><p></p><p>The burly man stared intently at the azure blue planet, his gaze unwavering.</p><p></p><p>"While that may be true, Qingniu and the others are in danger. They have fought alongside me for many years, and if I just leave them be, what kind of leader would I be? If that happens, not only will I, Xinghu, be mocked, but the entire Xingxing Tribe will be the subject of ridicule from other tribes.</p><p></p><p>I cannot allow the honor of my tribe to be tarnished. Nor can I stand by and watch them suffer without lending a hand."</p><p></p><p>"Have you informed the Forest God? Without the Forest God's consent, if you set out on your own, even if you return from the human world, the other divine beasts may unite to impeach you, which would not be a good outcome for you."</p><p></p><p>"Those fools? No need to worry. What the Forest God needs the most, aside from divine blood, is power. He and the other Supremes have been engaged in open and covert struggles for so many years, and divine beast-level subordinates are so precious. He won't severely punish me over this small matter."</p><p></p><p>"But what if you don't come back? What will happen to the Xingxing Tribe?"</p><p></p><p>"If I truly don't come back, then the Xingxing Tribe can merge into your Qingtian Tribe. Consider it my final request to my old friend."</p><p></p><p>"Ahu!"</p><p></p><p>The woman tightly grasped Xinghu's large hand, her eyes brimming with reluctance.</p><p></p><p>Xinghu squeezed her small hand, reassuring her:</p><p></p><p>"You don't need to worry too much. Although I'm going to the human realm, I won't be reckless.</p><p></p><p>I've calculated that there are no Emperor Realm experts on the human world's surface. As long as there are no Emperor Realm experts, they won't be able to pose a fatal threat to me.</p><p></p><p>If they unite against me, outnumbering me, I can also choose to hide and not foolishly confront them head-on."</p><p></p><p>The woman nodded.</p><p></p><p>"I'll wait for your return."</p><p></p><p>"I will definitely come back."</p><p></p><p>On Ye Xiao's side, he had already collected a large amount of offerings from the star beasts, distributing the materials to them, and then returning to the library to start working.</p><p></p><p>His current distribution plan was as follows:</p><p></p><p>For those like Susan, who did not need to consume their own blood qi, although they could provide powerful spiritual energy honey, he would not give them the best resources.</p><p></p><p>For those like Noel Fis and the others, who would consume a large amount of their blood qi and even cut off their tentacles, he would give them more resources.</p><p></p><p>If the distribution was unreasonable and caused imbalance and dissatisfaction among them, it would be a troublesome problem that would make his management more difficult.</p><p></p><p>The next goal and plan was to read books during the day in the library and continue to extract imperial techniques to synthesize the Slaughter God Technique.</p><p></p><p>Ye Xiao's second synthesized imperial technique was a healing-type imperial technique.</p><p></p><p>Although there were not many things that could currently injure him, his self-healing ability had already slowed down compared to before.</p><p></p><p>In order to prevent himself from being injured and unable to self-heal, he decided to cultivate the healing technique first.</p><p></p><p>After all, he was not currently engaging in any particularly dangerous battles or needing to flee and chase.</p><p></p><p>It didn't really matter, as it would only take sixteen days to synthesize another technique.</p><p></p><p>In the evenings, he would cultivate heavenly materials and earthly treasures, and then cultivate the star beasts.</p><p></p><p>These aspects were all interconnected.</p><p></p><p>First, by cultivating the star beasts to become stronger, their role in the Spirit Gathering Formation's eye would be more significant, further amplifying the speed at which the formation absorbed spiritual energy.</p><p></p><p>Secondly, the absorption speed of the entire city's spiritual energy. If they all became stronger, his farmland would also be able to obtain a massive amount of spiritual energy.</p><p></p><p>With abundant spiritual energy, the growth of heavenly materials and earthly treasures would also be faster.</p><p></p><p>The connecting medium in the middle was the formation, the Spirit Gathering Formation.</p><p></p><p>Here is my translation of the Chinese excerpt you provided:</p><p></p><p>In the process of forming the Gathering Spiritual Formation, it enhanced the speed at which both parties absorbed spiritual energy, thereby driving the mutual growth of heavenly materials, earthly treasures, and celestial beasts.</p><p></p><p>Spiritual energy is not valuable, as there is plenty of it everywhere between heaven and earth. However, the heavenly materials and earthly treasures it catalyzes, as well as the vital energy of the celestial beasts raised from them, are all very real. Using this vital energy to enhance one's own power is also very real.</p><p></p><p>After arriving above, he clocked in for work.</p><p></p><p>Ye Xiao noticed that Liu Chengxun's mental state did not seem very good, and couldn't help but ask curiously:</p><p></p><p>"What's wrong with you? You look a bit uncomfortable today. With your cultivation, you shouldn't be getting sick, right?"</p><p></p><p>Liu Chengxun glanced at him, looking a bit listless.</p><p></p><p>The events of last night had dealt him an extremely heavy blow.</p><p></p><p>He never imagined that the seemingly lowly sixth-grade Pavilion Master would actually be a Monarch Realm expert! He had previously thought that aside from Dao Sword Immortal, Dao God Li Liushui, and a few unknown Saint Emperors, he should be the strongest in this city.</p><p></p><p>Later, upon learning that those Saint Emperors were all seventh-grade Innate Realm, his inner confidence had become even more inflated.</p><p></p><p>Because he was eighth-grade Innate Realm.</p><p></p><p>This meant that aside from Dao Sword Immortal and Dao God Li Liushui, he was the strongest.</p><p></p><p>But now, the Pavilion Master had emerged, directly crushing Li Liushui, and it was unknown whether he could even surpass Senior Dao Sword Immortal.</p><p></p><p>As for him, he was nothing more than a tiny insignificant ant.</p><p></p><p>This made him feel particularly distressed.</p><p></p><p>"Ye Xiao, if one day you suddenly discovered that someone you looked down on had become an absolute expert, how would you feel?"</p><p></p><p>Ye Xiao: "-!"</p><p></p><p>"Hmm, I'm not too sure. If nothing unexpected happens, I probably won't have that kind of experience in my lifetime."</p><p></p><p>Liu Chengxun: "(Sigh)!"</p><p></p><p>It seems that's the case. Someone like Ye Xiao, as long as they have even a bit of talent, would be stronger than him. Even if he looked down on others, it would generally be others looking down on him, not the other way around.</p><p></p><p>Discussing this feeling with him seems to have been the wrong choice. He fundamentally cannot understand Liu Chengxun's feelings.</p><p></p><p>Of course, Ye Xiao understood what he meant - seeing the Pavilion Master suddenly become a Monarch Realm expert, and being unable to accept it psychologically.</p><p></p><p>This was also very understandable. After all, if the Pavilion Master hadn't shown up, then aside from Ye Xiao himself, the strongest in this library would have been Liu Chengxun.</p><p></p><p>And he didn't even know his own strength.</p><p></p><p>In this situation, at least in his own perception, he was the strongest existence in this library.</p><p></p><p>However, now a Monarch Realm expert had suddenly appeared above him, and it was indeed quite distressing.</p><p></p><p>If it were him, he probably would have had some slight difficulty adapting as well. But unfortunately, he was not in that position, and he was also a Monarch, so he had no such feelings and could not understand Liu Chengxun's current troubles.</p><p></p><p>However, seeing him so dejected, Ye Xiao still slowly opened his mouth to comfort him:</p><p></p><p>"Actually, I think this is a good thing.</p><p></p><p>Think about it carefully. If there's an super expert beside you, isn't your safety more guaranteed? If their strength was weaker, they might even end up harming you."</p><p></p><p>Liu Chengxun fell silent for a moment.</p><p></p><p>It does seem to make sense when put that way.</p><p></p><p>If it weren't for the Pavilion Master yesterday, he would probably already be dead. There's no way he'd be here discussing feelings with Ye Xiao.</p><p></p><p>"Sigh! It's really frustrating. Ever since coming to the Central State, I feel like I'm getting weaker and weaker day by day.</p><p></p><p>When I was in the Han State, I was the strongest cultivator in the entire Han State, revered like a god.</p><p></p><p>But now, here, I feel like a tiny insignificant ant. Anyone can just come and crush me."</p><p></p><p>"You can't compare a tiny place like the Han State to the vast Central State, it's not appropriate. The two are not on the same level at all.</p><p></p><p>But you can look at it from another angle - this is actually a good thing. At least it won't let you be complacent and arrogant.</p><p></p><p>With these motivations and broader horizons, your martial dao heart should become more calm and settled, refining itself more perfectly.</p><p></p><p>Maybe it can even help you advance to the ninth-grade Innate Realm faster."</p><p></p><p>Liu Chengxun fell silent for a moment, then nodded.</p><p></p><p>"You're right, that's the way it is. I should take them as role models and strive to improve my cultivation, rather than complaining here.</p><p></p><p>Ye Xiao, thank you."</p><p></p><p>"You're welcome."</p><p></p><p>Liu Chengxun went off to meditate, while Ye Xiao continued reading a book that had caught his interest.</p>

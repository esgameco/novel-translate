        <h1>Chapter 269</h1>
        <div class="content">
            <p>Here is the full English translation of the Chinese excerpt:</p><p></p><p>North Hall Cè was extremely excited.</p><p></p><p>But soon, his expression became serious again.</p><p></p><p>"However, if it's an unavoidable situation, I have to expose Mr. Ye's identity, don't I?"</p><p></p><p>Ye Xiao's heart sank. He wasn't ready to have his identity exposed yet.</p><p></p><p>In the past, he was afraid of his identity being exposed because his cultivation was too low, and he feared that some people might become jealous. </p><p></p><p>But now, he no longer needs to be afraid of others knowing.</p><p></p><p>Because he has grown stronger, there are few existences on the entire continent that can defeat a King Realm cultivator, and his strength is so powerful that the Nine Provinces will definitely try to recruit and protect him.</p><p></p><p>Now, he doesn't want to expose his identity simply because he doesn't want to disrupt his current peaceful life. </p><p></p><p>Once exposed to the world, he will likely become the most dazzling star, and his current way of life will no longer exist.</p><p></p><p>"Is it exposing it to the whole world?"</p><p></p><p>"No, it might only be exposed to one person, at most two people."</p><p></p><p>"That's fine then."</p><p></p><p>"Good! I need to go make some arrangements first. You wait here, I'll be back soon."</p><p></p><p>With that, North Hall Cè immediately turned into a whirlwind and rushed out.</p><p></p><p>Ye Xiao was a bit confused for a moment.</p><p></p><p>But North Hall Cè has been good to him, so he shouldn't be trying to harm him.</p><p></p><p>He doesn't need to worry too much.</p><p></p><p>On North Hall Cè's side, he rushed to the Martial Arts Library in Jianghai City at the fastest speed, heading straight for the residence of the Headmaster.</p><p></p><p>"Venerable Xuanwu, North Hall Cè of the Central Plains Divine Sect requests an audience. Please grant me an audience, Venerable."</p><p></p><p>The next moment, the lights in the room turned on, and the door automatically opened. </p><p></p><p>It was Jiang Chen controlling the door to open.</p><p></p><p>North Hall Cè quickly stepped inside.</p><p></p><p>"North Hall Cè, greetings to the Venerable."</p><p></p><p>Jiang Chen had already changed into a white silk practice robe and was sitting cross-legged on the bed, cultivating in meditation.</p><p></p><p>He had already sensed that the other party would come.</p><p></p><p>The cultivation of a King Realm expert is not something ordinary people can compare to.</p><p></p><p>"North Hall Cè, why did you suddenly come to Jianghai City? And at such a late hour to find this Venerable?"</p><p></p><p>North Hall Cè spoke again:</p><p></p><p>"Venerable, this disciple has come with an important matter to discuss."</p><p></p><p>"Speak without reservation."</p><p></p><p>"The dragon veins in the West have been plundered, does the Venerable know about this matter?"</p><p></p><p>"Of course I know about this! "</p><p></p><p>"Venerable, the dragon veins in the West have been plundered, it must be the work of the Demonic Beasts. If things go as expected, this calamity of the Demonic Beasts, the West is very likely to suffer unprecedented impact, and may even be completely destroyed.</p><p></p><p>When the lips perish, the teeth feel the chill. If the West is destroyed, we will be next.</p><p></p><p>To prevent the Nine Provinces from following in the footsteps of the West, we now need an extremely powerful combat force, a force capable of turning the tide of the battle!"</p><p></p><p>Jiang Chen couldn't help but raise his eyebrows.</p><p></p><p>"Why are you talking nonsense? Just say what you want directly."</p><p></p><p>"I want a spot to go to the Changbai Dragon Vein!"</p><p></p><p>Jiang Chen's expression suddenly became serious.</p><p></p><p>"Is that what you came to tell me? Are you just joking with me? Do you know how important the Changbai Dragon Vein is? It is related to the important task of reviving the other dragon veins.</p><p></p><p>No one is allowed to go there easily."</p><p></p><p>"What if it's an existence with the potential to become an Emperor Realm expert?"</p><p></p><p>Jiang Chen's pupils contracted.</p><p></p><p>"North Hall Cè, don't talk nonsense with me. If that's not the case, this Venerable won't be polite to you."</p><p></p><p>North Hall Cè took a deep breath. He originally wanted to help Ye Xiao hide it, but now it seems that in order to get him that opportunity, he can't hide it anymore.</p><p></p><p>"Venerable, I'm not talking nonsense. Every word I'm about to say is the truth.</p><p></p><p>In Jianghai City, there is a genius with monstrous talent beyond imagination!"</p><p></p><p>Jiang Chen raised his eyebrows again.</p><p></p><p>"Are you talking about that Empress bloodline? Qin Yuyan?"</p><p></p><p>North Hall Cè shook his head.</p><p></p><p>"No, it's not her, it's a hundred, a thousand, even ten thousand times stronger than her!"</p><p></p><p>"That's impossible."</p><p></p><p>Jiang Chen flatly denied his words.</p><p></p><p>It is well known that the Empress bloodline is the strongest existence in this world. </p><p></p><p>In terms of cultivation speed or anything else, the Empress bloodline is the strongest.</p><p></p><p>Even including Jiang Chen himself as one of the Four Venerables, they are all former Empress bloodlines! They have the qualifications to succeed the Venerable Xuanwu and receive the inheritance of the King Realm experts!</p><p></p><p>"Have you ever seen a 21-year-old King Realm expert?"</p><p></p><p>"What did you say? Say it again!"</p><p></p><p>The Venerable Xuanwu suddenly sat up from his position, the shocked expression on his face causing a slight smile to appear on North Hall Cè's lips.</p><p></p><p>"A 21-year-old King Realm expert!"</p><p></p><p>"This is impossible. You're trying to deceive me, aren't you? You're a hundred percent trying to deceive me, right?"</p><p></p><p>"You are the mighty Venerable Xuanwu. If I were to try to deceive you with this kind of thing, do you think I would have any good end?"</p><p></p><p>The Venerable fell silent, with a dazed expression on his face.</p><p></p><p>He simply could not believe his ears.</p><p></p><p>A 21-year-old King Realm expert! How is this possible?</p><p></p><p>Looking back on the entire history of the Nine Provinces, there are few such existences!</p><p></p><p>If there is really a person who can become a King Realm expert at the age of 21, then without a doubt, he will be the most talented person in this world.</p><p></p><p>Here is my translation of the Chinese excerpt you provided:</p><p></p><p>The future of this person is almost 100% certain to allow him to become an Empyrean realm expert.</p><p></p><p>"Do you understand clearly? Could it be that someone has enlightened him?"</p><p></p><p>Jiang Chen still had some doubts.</p><p></p><p>After all, if he cultivated it himself, his cultivation base could indeed be very strong. </p><p></p><p>But if he was enlightened by some senior experts, it would be different.</p><p></p><p>Perhaps this is the limit of his lifetime.</p><p></p><p>Although the King Realm is also a powerful expert, the impact brought by self-cultivation is completely different.</p><p></p><p>A 21-year-old King Realm expert cultivated by himself is an unprecedented prodigy!</p><p></p><p>"It is 100% self-cultivation, I can vouch for it with my integrity. </p><p></p><p>More than a month ago, when he went to the Central Plains, he was still at the Ninth Rank of the Celestial Saint Sect. It was I who guided him to the Martial Saint Stele, allowing him to comprehend the King Realm realm.</p><p></p><p>And now, he has broken through to the King Realm cultivation."</p><p></p><p>Jiang Chen couldn't help but take a deep breath.</p><p></p><p>In just one month, from the Ninth Rank of the Celestial Saint Sect to directly becoming a King Realm expert, and it was self-comprehension and cultivation, unprecedented in history! Seeing Jiang Chen's reaction, even though Beiting Ce had cultivated for a few hundred years, he still couldn't help but raise the corners of his mouth, feeling a little proud.</p><p></p><p>Let you not believe me just now, now you know you are shocked, right? Jiang Chen recovered and immediately said:</p><p></p><p>"Quick! Take me to see him right away."</p><p></p><p>At this moment, even Jiang Chen, one of the Four Great Venerable Ones of the Nine Provinces, couldn't help but be a little flustered, hurrying to go see Ye Xiao.</p><p></p><p>"I'll take you there right away."</p><p></p><p>A few breaths later, at Ye Xiao's house.</p><p></p><p>"Greetings, Curator."</p><p></p><p>Jiang Chen's mind: "(灬)!"</p><p>Jiang Chen's soul: "（⊙.⊙）!"</p><p>Jiang Chen's inner heart: "Grass!"</p><p>Jiang Chen's whole body: "(_)!"</p><p></p><p>He was completely dumbfounded. Ye Xiao didn't expect Beiting Ce to bring the Curator over.</p><p></p><p>Beiting Ce looked at Jiang Chen's expression and couldn't help but chuckle, but he had completely forgotten that when he learned that Ye Xiao was a King Realm expert, he had the same reaction.</p><p></p><p>"Aren't you the manager in my library? The one who was the librarian before?"</p><p></p><p>"Ye Xiao."</p><p></p><p>Beiting Ce supplemented next to him.</p><p></p><p>"Oh! That's right, your name is Ye Xiao! You...you are a King Realm expert?"</p><p></p><p>Jiang Chen felt like his brain was completely twisted.</p><p></p><p>He didn't notice Ye Xiao at all in the library before. But today he was told that Ye Xiao is a King Realm expert? Good heavens, this is just a huge joke with him.</p><p></p><p>"The Sword Immortal of Jianghai City, is also you?"</p><p></p><p>Ye Xiao nodded.</p><p></p><p>"You're really only 21 years old?"</p><p></p><p>Ye Xiao nodded again.</p><p></p><p>"You're really a King Realm expert?"</p><p></p><p>Jiang Chen couldn't help but ask again, and Ye Xiao had no choice but to release a trace of his aura.</p><p></p><p>Boom! Jiang Chen's mind immediately exploded like a pot.</p><p></p><p>It's true.</p><p>Ye Xiao is really a King Realm expert.</p><p></p><p>At this moment, the last glimmer of hope in his heart completely disappeared.</p><p></p><p>His worldview was completely shattered and collapsed! There is really someone in this world who can achieve the realm of a King Realm expert in just 21 years! This record can almost be applied for the world's first.</p><p></p><p>"I want to know, how did you cultivate? Can you tell me?"</p><p></p><p>Jiang Chen was extremely curious.</p><p></p><p>Ye Xiao was silent for a moment.</p><p></p><p>"Well, just normal cultivation. The way you all cultivate, that's how I cultivate."</p><p></p><p>Jiang Chen nodded.</p><p></p><p>I see, a secret, unwilling to say.</p><p></p><p>This is also understandable, after all, the other party can cultivate to the King Realm expert in 21 years, his cultivation method must be very unique and extremely diligent.</p><p></p><p>Jiang Chen guessed that Ye Xiao probably doesn't sleep at night at all, and has been working hard on cultivation from birth to the present.</p><p></p><p>Beiting Ce spoke again:</p><p></p><p>"Venerable One, how is it? Do you believe it now? Can you give this position to Ye Xiao?"</p><p></p><p>Jiang Chen nodded.</p><p></p><p>"You're right. It's possible now. If he doesn't qualify, there might not be a second person in the world who does."</p><p></p><p>Ye Xiao was a little puzzled.</p><p></p><p>Beiting Ce explained for him:</p><p></p><p>"You know, our Nine Provinces is the sacred land of the Divine Continent, with many innate dragon veins. These dragon veins contain powerful dragon qi, which is the key for the human race to become Empyrean experts.</p><p></p><p>However, hundreds of years ago, there was an emperor who severed ninety-nine dragon veins in the Nine Provinces, leaving only one dragon vein. In addition, there is also the Kunlun Dragon Vein, the ancestor of all dragons, but it has long since self-sealed and no one can find it.</p><p></p><p>Now, there is only the remaining Long White Dragon Vein that still exists."</p>

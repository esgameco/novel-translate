        <h1>Chapter 310</h1>
        <div class="content">
            <p>Here is the full English translation of the Chinese excerpt:</p><p></p><p>He felt his entire body's qi and blood constantly boiling, and the power within him also seemed to be gradually rising.</p><p></p><p>Shocked, he immediately came to the starry sky, and the Vixen Queen also followed closely behind, coming to his side.</p><p></p><p>The two of them gazed out at the starry sky together.</p><p></p><p>There, seven massive stars were moving in a bizarre manner, with a sense of wanting to connect into a line.</p><p></p><p>"Grandma, what is this? The Seven Stars Aligned, isn't that supposed to happen only once every sixty years? Why is it appearing again now? Has there ever been such an event in history?"</p><p></p><p>The Vixen Queen's face grew grave as she said, "There has never been such an event in history before. The Seven Stars Aligned follows a certain natural law. When it is in effect, it will create a special magnetic field, causing the star beasts in this region of the starry sky to have their bloodlines boil, leading to a rapid increase in their strength.</p><p></p><p>Such a major event, if it were to occur twice in quick succession, the human race would not be able to withstand it and would collapse."</p><p></p><p>Ning Yutian anxiously said, "No, I have to go tell the Overseer. I have to return to the human world."</p><p></p><p>"Don't go!" the Vixen Queen suddenly grabbed Ning Yutian.</p><p></p><p>"Grandma, why?" Ning Yutian was somewhat perplexed, and the Vixen Queen's face grew grave as she said,</p><p></p><p>"Don't go, it would be a waste of effort. Don't you understand? After the previous occurrence of the Seven Stars Aligned, for it to happen again so soon, it's obvious that there is a formidable existence behind the scenes, trying to destroy this human world."</p><p></p><p>Ning Yutian's spirit trembled. "A formidable existence? What kind of formidable existence? Even stronger than Emperors and Supernal Beasts?"</p><p></p><p>The Vixen Queen took a deep breath, her face solemn as she said, "You must know that in this universe, there are countless races. But there is one race that reigns supreme over the others. That is the Godly Race!</p><p></p><p>If someone is able to trigger the Seven Stars Aligned, then they must be an existence from the Godly Race!"</p><p></p><p>"The Godly Race!"</p><p></p><p>"Yes!" The Vixen Queen nodded firmly.</p><p></p><p>"The Godly Race is the ultimate existence that humans can cultivate to. Their descendants are born with extremely high talents, and most of them can reach the Emperor Realm in their lifetime. Their limits far surpass the human Emperor Realm. Moreover, as more and more of their clansmen break through the legendary Godly Realm, their Godly Race bloodline will remain constantly activated, keeping their race supremely powerful."</p><p></p><p>Ning Yutian's heart was pounding furiously. This was the first time he had heard of such a terrifying existence.</p><p></p><p>"But Grandma, that doesn't make sense. If they are the Godly Race, why would they want to incite the star beasts to harm the human race? The Godly Race is already so powerful, why would they still want to trouble the human race? And I know that the human race's blood has Godly blood in it. Humans are also descendants of the Godly Race, so why would the Godly Race want to destroy their own descendants?"</p><p></p><p>The Vixen Queen smiled wryly. "You fool! Do you think the Godly Race is a single race? Even within the Godly Race, there are many different tribes.</p><p></p><p>The Xuanyuan Tribe, the Dragon Tribe, the Phoenix Tribe... These tribes are constantly at war with each other, fighting for more resources.</p><p></p><p>It is said that the human race you belong to inherits the Xuanyuan Tribe.</p><p></p><p>If the one behind this is a Godly Race tribe other than the Xuanyuan, they would use these star beasts to devour the human race, in order to extract the Godly blood related to the Xuanyuan Tribe within the human race.</p><p></p><p>This would allow them to enhance their own power. And they wouldn't be discovered either.</p><p></p><p>They must be afraid of the Xuanyuan Godly Tribe finding out, otherwise they wouldn't have used the star beasts, they would have acted themselves already."</p><p></p><p>Ning Yutian clenched his fists. "No, if that's the case, then I must go tell the Overseer."</p><p></p><p>"Yutian, have you thought this through? If you disrupt the plans of an existence of that level, and they discover you, you will be utterly destroyed, and even our Silver Fox Valley may not escape death."</p><p></p><p>Ning Yutian took a deep breath, his face grave as he said, "Grandma, the Overseer has a great life-saving grace towards us. Towards me personally, he has an even greater life-saving grace. Now that we are facing this situation, I absolutely cannot stand by and watch the Overseer die due to his ignorance.</p><p></p><p>If I were that kind of person, could you guarantee that one day when the Silver Fox Tribe is in danger, I won't abandon the Silver Fox Tribe?"</p><p></p><p>The Vixen Queen's body trembled, and her gaze gradually softened as she smiled self-deprecatingly.</p><p></p><p>"You're right. I was just thinking about how unstoppable the Godly Race is, and didn't consider that in the end, selfishness will also harm oneself.</p><p></p><p>Go then, take Youwei with you, she knows the location of the spatial passage."</p><p></p><p>"Thank you, Grandma."</p><p></p><p>Ning Yutian immediately took Youwei and headed to Jianghai City to deliver the news.</p><p></p><p>At the same time, Ye Xiao was in the library reading books. He could no longer casually continue to improve his cultivation.</p><p></p><p>Wanting to break through from the Emperor Realm to the Godly Realm was even more difficult.</p><p></p><p>He needed to forge one hundred and eight Protective Golden Dragons to temper his divine soul.</p><p></p><p>Each Protective Golden Dragon required an extremely vast amount of dragon qi.</p><p></p><p>Just imagine, even a top-tier dragon vein like the Changbai Dragon Vein, the dragon qi there is just a tiny bit.</p><p></p><p>For an Emperor Realm cultivator to obtain...</p><p></p><p>Here is the full English translation of the Chinese excerpt:</p><p></p><p>Reaching the Godly Realm, how much spiritual energy must one absorb to condense enough dragon qi?</p><p></p><p>However, the divine book spirit within his body can cultivate on its own, without the need for him to cultivate it like other martial artists.</p><p></p><p>Except for the rare times when he has nothing to read, he would choose one cultivation method to meditate on, to slightly increase his cultivation speed. But most of the time, he is just reading books.</p><p></p><p>Because reading books allows him to learn more techniques, and then combine them into more powerful cultivation methods.</p><p></p><p>Powerful cultivation methods often mean faster execution speed, allowing for quicker absorption of spiritual energy. It's like a water pump - a small one can't compare to a dragon-level one.</p><p></p><p>By increasing the quantity and quality of his cultivation methods, as well as the speed of spiritual energy absorption, Ye Xiao naturally raises his dragon qi gathering.</p><p></p><p>One day, while he was reading, Liu Chengxun suddenly came to his side, his expression somewhat grave.</p><p></p><p>"Ye Xiao, I have to leave."</p><p></p><p>Ye Xiao looked up at him.</p><p></p><p>"Returning to the Han State?"</p><p></p><p>Liu Chengxun nodded.</p><p></p><p>"The Nine States Alliance has suddenly announced that the beast calamity is about to begin. Without me, the Han State will lose its top expert support. No matter what, the Han State has always shown me grace, as they cultivated me. At this time, I must return."</p><p></p><p>"I've heard this beast calamity may be very dangerous."</p><p></p><p>"That's right. I came to tell you to be careful. I hope we can meet again after the beast calamity is over."</p><p></p><p>Ye Xiao nodded.</p><p></p><p>"Wait a moment, I remember that senior blacksmith said he has already reforged your sword. Let me go get it for you, so you can have a boost in strength during the battles."</p><p></p><p>Liu Chengxun's treasure sword had previously only reached the Emperor Weapon level. </p><p></p><p>During the attack on the Jianghai City by the Beast Deity Alliance, it was shattered by the Dragon Slayer.</p><p></p><p>Ye Xiao had helped repair it, and the grade was now much higher, becoming a true Emperor Weapon.</p><p></p><p>Liu Chengxun's eyes lit up, and he was also somewhat shocked.</p><p></p><p>"It's been repaired so quickly? It seems this senior you found is truly extraordinary!"</p><p></p><p>"I don't know the details, you just wait here, I'll go get it."</p><p></p><p>Ye Xiao went home to retrieve Liu Chengxun's sword. </p><p></p><p>Originally, he had stored the treasure sword in his storage ring.</p><p></p><p>But the storage ring had been used quite frequently lately, sometimes becoming full. With no other choice, he had taken it out and placed it at home.</p><p></p><p>Before coming, Ye Xiao had even sealed a sword light within it.</p><p></p><p>This beast calamity seemed troublesome, and there might be very powerful beast celestials going to the Han State. </p><p></p><p>He hoped Liu Chengxun wouldn't need to use that sword light.</p><p></p><p>When he brought the long sword back to Liu Chengxun, the latter swept a glance over it, and his heart immediately shook.</p><p></p><p>"The forging level is so formidable."</p><p></p><p>With his discerning eye, he could naturally see that the repaired sword was vastly stronger than his previous one, completely becoming an Emperor Weapon.</p><p></p><p>It had gone from barely reaching the Emperor Weapon level to becoming a true Emperor Weapon.</p><p></p><p>"The Nine States are truly remarkable! Casually producing a master blacksmith who can surpass all the forgers in the Han State by a mile. </p><p></p><p>Terrifying!"</p><p></p><p>Ye Xiao smiled.</p><p></p><p>"Alright, don't be so amazed. Hurry up and be on your way, it's getting late!"</p><p></p><p>Liu Chengxun nodded, still feeling quite emotional:</p><p></p><p>"My greatest wish in coming to the Jianghai City this time was to meet Senior Sword Immortal, but I haven't had the chance up till now. </p><p></p><p>If I survive the beast calamity, I will definitely come back here to seek out the Senior's footsteps."</p><p></p><p>Ye Xiao smiled faintly: "Don't worry, you will have the chance to meet him."</p><p></p><p>Liu Chengxun nodded again, cupping his hands in farewell: </p><p></p><p>"Ye Xiao, until we meet again, take care!"</p><p></p><p>"Take care."</p><p></p><p>After Liu Chengxun left, Ye Xiao turned his gaze towards the starry sky, his expression becoming somewhat grave.</p><p></p><p>He vaguely sensed something, a bad feeling that was familiar, as if he had encountered it before, but couldn't quite put his finger on what it was.</p><p></p><p>At this moment, his Indestructible Divine Body cultivation, Undying Immortal Spirit cultivation, and Heart of Stone cultivation had finally fully fused, forming a brand new Godly Realm-level body cultivation method - the Great Perfection Divine Body.</p><p></p><p>This was a method to refine the divine body, a cultivation that combined body, spirit, and heart refinement into one divine technique.</p><p></p><p>With this technique, Ye Xiao's physique, at his current Emperor Realm level, had already begun refining towards the divine body.</p><p></p><p>Once he reached the Godly Realm, who knows what level he could attain? </p><p></p><p>Could he surpass the ordinary Godly Realm physique? </p><p></p><p>During battles, could he greatly enhance his defensive power? Or would there be other even more powerful and wondrous changes?</p><p></p><p>(This chapter ends)</p>

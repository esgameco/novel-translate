        <h1>Chapter 112</h1>
        <div class="content">
            <p>Here is the full English translation of the Chinese excerpt:</p><p></p><p>The black market was getting more and more chaotic, with the vendors hurriedly packing up their goods and rushing over here to avoid the trouble.</p><p></p><p>The members of the defense team had already started charging over.</p><p></p><p>Ye Xiao shook his head, waved to Wang Dailong, and turned to leave.</p><p></p><p>He didn't feel like joining the vendors to watch the commotion.</p><p></p><p>If it were humans being surrounded by beast-stars, being of the same human race, he might have drawn his sword to lend a small hand.</p><p></p><p>But this was a conflict and slaughter driven by human greed, and he had no intention of getting involved, playing the role of a self-righteous do-gooder! Activating the Divine Intent Technique, Ye Xiao quickly returned home.</p><p></p><p>The night passed in the blink of an eye.</p><p></p><p>The next morning, Ye Xiao woke up from his sleep and went to work as usual.</p><p></p><p>After buying breakfast, he still came to Mr. Xu's shop.</p><p></p><p>Yesterday, he had decided to make a slight modification to Mr. Xu's memory.</p><p></p><p>"Mr. Xu."</p><p></p><p>"Coming, coming."</p><p></p><p>Mr. Xu came out with a smile, although Ye Xiao was not his biggest customer, Ye Xiao was a stable source and had great potential, so he still valued him quite a bit.</p><p></p><p>However, as soon as he came out and met Ye Xiao's eyes, Ye Xiao immediately activated the Taixuan Tiangong.</p><p></p><p>In an instant, Mr. Xu was frozen in place, his face expressionless.</p><p></p><p>Ye Xiao modified his memory, changing the throwing knives to something inherited from his ancestors.</p><p></p><p>Furthermore, Ye Xiao modified the over 1 million yuan that Mr. Xu had transferred to him, changing it to money given to him for marrying Mr. Xu's daughter.</p><p></p><p>Mr. Xu's cultivation was only at the Posterior Heaven Fourth Realm, completely unable to resist Ye Xiao's Taixuan Tiangong, and was quickly modified.</p><p></p><p>If his cultivation was stronger, with powerful spiritual force, Ye Xiao wouldn't have been able to do this so easily. If there were any traces of the memory modification left, it would be discovered by others who specialize in spiritual power or have high cultivation, and that would backfire and bring greater threats.</p><p></p><p>After the modification, Ye Xiao let out a deep breath.</p><p></p><p>Now, his secret would not be leaked.</p><p></p><p>But soon, he saw Mr. Xu frowning and staring at him intently.</p><p></p><p>"Little Ye, you did take my money! If you don't marry my daughter, don't blame me for turning against you! Be careful, I might get someone to chop you up!"</p><p></p><p>Ye Xiao: "(_..)!"</p><p></p><p>It seems this method is not very feasible.</p><p></p><p>He activated the Taixuan Tiangong again, changing the approach.</p><p></p><p>Modify it to... hmm... that he saved Mr. Xu's life? Also not quite right, with Ye Xiao's cultivation only at the Posterior Heaven Second Realm, how could he have saved a Posterior Heaven Fourth Realm Mr. Xu? After scanning through Mr. Xu's memories, he felt it would be better to change it to Mr. Xu losing to him in a card game.</p><p></p><p>Mr. Xu did frequently play in the chess and card room next door, and in this world, gambling was not viewed as seriously.</p><p></p><p>This would be a more reasonable explanation.</p><p></p><p>After finishing this, Mr. Xu regained his senses and looked at Ye Xiao with an unwilling expression: "Little Ye, we should play a few hands another day. I lost over 100,000 yuan to you last time due to bad luck. When my luck is good, I must win it back!"</p><p></p><p>Ye Xiao nodded, with a slight smile on his lips.</p><p></p><p>Now he could truly rest assured.</p><p></p><p>"I'll play with you another day, I need to get to work now, goodbye."</p><p></p><p>"Goodbye."</p><p></p><p>After the two parted ways, Mr. Xu turned and went back into the shop. Mr. Xu's daughter Xu Da Mao came down from upstairs carrying two bags of materials, and couldn't help but ask:</p><p></p><p>"Dad? What were you and Ye Xiao whispering about just now?"</p><p></p><p>Mr. Xu snorted coldly.</p><p></p><p>"Nothing! From now on, you are not to get close to that Ye Xiao."</p><p></p><p>Here is my translation of the Chinese excerpt you provided:</p><p></p><p>"He talks too much, he's not a good person," said the father.</p><p></p><p>Xu Daomao ("Big Cat Xu"): "Huh?!"</p><p></p><p>She was completely puzzled. What was going on with her father? Hadn't he been wanting to set her up with Ye Xiao all this time? How could he suddenly tell her not to have much contact with Ye Xiao?</p><p></p><p>It was very strange.</p><p></p><p>But she didn't think too much about it, because her cultivation level was not high, and she couldn't possibly imagine that Ye Xiao had the ability to modify her father's memories.</p><p></p><p>On Ye Xiao's side, he was eating a steamed bun and drinking soy milk, unhurriedly making his way to the library.</p><p></p><p>Arriving in the main city area, there were clearly more patrol vehicles on the streets, and the sound of sirens occasionally drifted by him.</p><p></p><p>Before long, a motorcycle pulled up beside him.</p><p></p><p>"Old Ye, want me to give you a ride?" </p><p></p><p>The one addressing him this way could only be Gu Hai.</p><p></p><p>"No need, I'll walk there myself.</p><p></p><p>By the way, what are your patrol team doing so early in the morning? Why is the street so solemn?"</p><p></p><p>Gu Hai took off his gloves and took a bite of a steamed bun from his bag.</p><p></p><p>"Don't even mention it. Last night in the black market, a group of idiots got into a fight over snatching a grandmaster-level armor set, and several people ended up dead. The armor was also stolen in the chaos.</p><p></p><p>So this morning, Nangong Ling commanded that all the patrol team members be deployed throughout the city to search for that armor, as well as the criminals involved in the murder."</p><p></p><p>"I see, so you'd better hurry up then. If you catch the culprits, you can get a nice bonus to buy milk powder for your pregnant wife."</p><p></p><p>Gu Hai's wife, Lu Wanwan, was already several months pregnant and about to give birth.</p><p></p><p>"Alright, I'm off then. Be careful these days, don't go to any secluded alleys alone, it's easy to run into danger."</p><p></p><p>"Got it."</p><p></p><p>Gu Hai rode off on his motorcycle.</p><p></p><p>As for Ye Xiao, he continued unhurriedly towards the library.</p><p></p><p>He didn't feel the slightest sympathy for the dead people. </p><p></p><p>They were all greedy people who didn't want to spend money to buy it, and tried to snatch it in the chaos, so they got what they deserved.</p><p></p><p>Soon, he arrived at a three-way intersection.</p><p></p><p>This three-way intersection was the necessary path to the library.</p><p></p><p>One way led to the main road, which would be a detour.</p><p></p><p>The other way was the small path he often took, which could lead him directly to another main road, and then straight to the library gate.</p><p></p><p>Why would he hesitate? </p><p></p><p>His cultivation was so strong, with the Indestructible Divine Skill protecting him, and the Imperial Armored Black Scale Armor! Not to mention a few small-time bandits, even if he encountered a Saint Monarch, what would he have to fear? With a flick of his finger, he could unleash a sword ki to annihilate the opponent! If one wasn't enough, he could do it a billion times!</p><p></p><p>After all, he had the Empyrean Violet Jade Sea Technique, a supreme imperial-level cultivation method, so he would never lack spiritual energy.</p><p></p><p>So of course he would take the main road!</p><p></p><p>After all, this wasn't Earth, but a world of infinite possibilities filled with spiritual martial arts.</p><p></p><p>According to some clichéd rules, if he relied on his strong cultivation and insisted on taking the small path, he would most likely run into some thugs.</p><p></p><p>If it wasn't clichéd, then no problem, he could just easily destroy the thugs with a sword ki.</p><p></p><p>But if it was clichéd, who knows what kind of unstable factors might appear? What if they shouted "The river flows east for thirty years, then west for thirty years," and then ran away, only to return with an old grandpa later? Ye Xiao was an extremely averse to trouble kind of person.</p><p></p><p>If he could avoid trouble, he would avoid it.</p>

        <h1>Chapter 168</h1>
        <div class="content">
            <p>Here is the full English translation of the Chinese excerpt:</p><p></p><p>Xian'er looked at the two red roses, her beautiful brows furrowed.</p><p></p><p>What is this? Two roses, could it be the Immortal Swordsman?</p><p></p><p>Is there something wrong? It's like a child playing house? But since the Master has said so, it shouldn't be wrong. I'll just take a look and see what tricks he's up to.</p><p></p><p>The people below were also dumbfounded, seeing a young girl holding two flowers, completely unaware of what she was going to do. "Who is she?"</p><p></p><p>"I don't know."</p><p></p><p>"I know, she's my ex-girlfriend."</p><p></p><p>"Hey, eat more vegetables, don't just drink."</p><p></p><p>"I've been holding it in all morning, my urine is yellow, I'll come wake him up!"</p><p></p><p>The teasing words from the crowd instantly filled the solemn scene with cheerfulness.</p><p></p><p>After running to the river bank, the girl raised the two red roses in her hand and asked:</p><p></p><p>"Which one of you is the Sword Saint of Han Zhou, Liu Chengxun?"</p><p></p><p>Liu Chengxun looked at her with a slight puzzlement.</p><p></p><p>"That would be me."</p><p></p><p>The girl looked at the two flowers in her hand, then raised the rose in her right hand and said:</p><p></p><p>"Here, this flower is for you."</p><p></p><p>Liu Chengxun's brows raised even higher, looking at the flower with confusion.</p><p></p><p>But soon, he noticed the unusual nature of the flower.</p><p></p><p>His expression became grave, he took a deep breath and spoke to the girl:</p><p></p><p>"I will accept this flower."</p><p></p><p>Afterwards, he began to unleash his powerful Deity Sect-level aura! Shi Guanghao, Lang Xinyue, and Murakami Higan all noticed the unusual nature of the two flowers and couldn't help but squint their eyes.</p><p></p><p>"This person is so strong!"</p><p></p><p>Shi Guanghao couldn't help but praise.</p><p></p><p>Lang Xinyue nodded.</p><p></p><p>"Not only a Deity Sect strike, even the most ordinary post-Heavenly warrior's attack would not be able to withstand a delicate little flower, but he managed to do it.</p><p></p><p>This level of strength, Lang can certainly not achieve."</p><p></p><p>Murakami Higan did not speak, the Japanese, his eyes rolling in his sockets, unknown what he was thinking.</p><p></p><p>As Liu Chengxun began to unleash his powerful Deity Sect-level aura, the people on the river bank were instantly suppressed, like a mountain pressing down on them. Some could not even raise their heads.</p><p></p><p>Most of the warriors were forced to the ground, with at least 80% of them prostrating on the river bank.</p><p></p><p>Only those with at least post-Heavenly Eighth Rank cultivation could barely hold on.</p><p></p><p>But even then, their faces were flushed red, and their blood was rushing wildly! Even Sect Masters like Qin Shenglong had somewhat pale faces, finding it slightly difficult to bear.</p><p></p><p>Only those who had reached the level of Da Changfeng and Fa Zheng could be considered somewhat better, barely able to avoid being embarrassed.</p><p></p><p>"So this is the pressure of the Deity Sect level?" </p><p></p><p>Da Changfeng couldn't help but exclaim.</p><p></p><p>The pressure of the Deity Sect level was too strong! Overwhelmingly strong, like a great mountain pressing down on everyone's hearts, making them unable to even raise their heads.</p><p></p><p>This was only the performance of the 49th ranked on the World Dragon Ranking. If it was the 10th ranked Sword Saint Lu Qingshan, how powerful would that be? People were truly divided into different levels!</p><p></p><p>Among the crowd, Pao Jiansheng looked at this scene, sighing with emotion, filled with infinite reverence for his master. This was his master, the Sword Saint! A Deity Sect Eighth Rank expert! Would his master win, or would the senior Immortal Swordsman prevail? Pao Jiansheng's fists clenched tightly.</p><p></p><p>The answer he had been anticipating for over a year was about to be revealed.</p><p></p><p>When the aura reached its peak, Liu Chengxun finally made his move.</p><p></p><p>He used his finger as a sword, unleashing a sword strike.</p><p></p><p>In an instant, above his head, a dazzling lightning bolt suddenly erupted, causing all eyes to focus and all breathing to pause.</p><p></p><p>The powerful sword intent, with an overbearing posture, struck towards the girl.</p><p></p><p>In this moment, the wind on the river surface seemed to be suppressed, unable to howl.</p><p></p><p>In this moment, the clouds in the sky also seemed to be frozen, unable to drift.</p><p></p><p>In this moment, the entire world seemed to have stopped.</p><p></p><p>Between heaven and earth, it was as if only Liu Chengxun's sword strike remained.</p><p></p><p>Everything was completed in an instant, Liu Chengxun's sword was extremely fast, worthy of being the renowned Sword Saint of Han Zhou.</p><p></p><p>One sword strike, like a sudden burst of icy light, arriving in an instant, occupying almost all the advantage and superiority!</p><p></p><p>This single sword strike was a height that many could not reach in their entire lives.</p><p></p><p>But in that instant, the rose in the girl's right hand also moved.</p><p></p><p>Its body first began to emit a golden light, then its power, in an instant, reached a stronger aura than Liu Chengxun's, instantly surpassing him.</p><p></p><p>And when its aura reached its peak, it charged straight at Liu Chengxun like a bolt of lightning.</p><p></p><p>Without any preparatory moves like Liu Chengxun, it was just a flash of golden light, simple and casual.</p><p></p><p>Then the sword shot out like a dragon, piercing the heavens.</p><p></p><p>Boom! In the instant it appeared, it directly collided with Liu Chengxun's sword beam, and then ruthlessly shattered Liu Chengxun's sword beam, soaring into the sky! The sword beam slashed through the sky, breaking through all of Liu Chengxun's aura!</p><p></p><p>In this moment, the wind and floating clouds that had been suppressed by Liu Chengxun's aura seemed to be unsealed.</p><p></p><p>The wind began to blow again.</p><p></p><p>Here is the full English translation of the Chinese excerpt:</p><p></p><p>The wind blew, and the clouds began to flow once again.</p><p></p><p>Liu Chengxun's gaze, from filled with confidence to dim and lifeless, only took a second.</p><p></p><p>"Poof!"</p><p></p><p>Liu Chengxun spat out a mouthful of fresh blood, instantly dropping to one knee, only just managing to stay upright and not collapse.</p><p></p><p>But even so, his face was already deathly pale, with large beads of sweat rolling down from his face.</p><p></p><p>One sword! The Sword Saint of the Han State, Liu Chengxun, was defeated! The entire venue was as silent as a stagnant pool of water.</p><p></p><p>Everyone had not yet reacted, staring blankly at the scene before them.</p><p></p><p>Even the great masters like Dou Changfeng were dumbfounded.</p><p></p><p>Even the three Sage Patriarchs, Cun Shangbian, Shi Guanghao, and Lang Xinyue, were stunned.</p><p></p><p>Was that it? Was it really that simple? A single flower, a single sword intent? And Liu Chengxun had even struck first! But in the end, Liu Chengxun was still defeated, thoroughly and undisputedly defeated.</p><p></p><p>At this moment, everyone seemed to finally understand why the Sword Immortal had not come.</p><p></p><p>Because he did not need to.</p><p></p><p>Liu Chengxun was not his opponent at all; he had never taken Liu Chengxun seriously from the beginning.</p><p></p><p>All the critics fell silent, even those from the Korean Peninsula and Japan dared not post any more disrespectful remarks about the Sword Immortal online.</p><p></p><p>This sword, they were convinced!</p><p></p><p>No matter how vile their character, no matter how despicable they were in their daily lives, in the face of Ye Xiao's sword, they were completely subdued, defeated wholeheartedly, without a shred of resentment.</p><p></p><p>Park Jeon-saeng unclenched his fists, and the corners of his mouth curled up slightly.</p><p></p><p>He did not not help his master, but he had witnessed the birth of a true warrior! A true martial artist would not show favoritism due to emotions, even if the person was their own family. A true martial artist would only respect the strong and the brilliant confrontation!</p><p></p><p>And the Sword Immortal was indeed a true strong one! Taking a deep breath, he sat down cross-legged, and after witnessing that stunning and magnificent sword strike, he suddenly grasped the key to breaking through the Patriarch realm.</p><p></p><p>The spiritual energy in his body surged like a river unleashed from a dam, coursing through his entire meridians, and Park Jeon-saeng completely broke through the innate ninth level, officially becoming a Patriarch realm expert! And he was not the only one; soon, a second person sat down cross-legged, then a third, a fourth, a fifth... This place had gathered the geniuses from dozens of cities nearby, who had come early by plane and high-speed rail to witness this battle.</p><p></p><p>At least the elites from tens of cities in the Nine Provinces had gathered here.</p><p></p><p>And after witnessing Ye Xiao's sword strike, countless people experienced a brand new breakthrough, both in their mindset and cultivation.</p><p></p><p>That sword was too powerful! Its impact on them had surpassed everything they had learned in their lives.</p><p></p><p>Some had been stuck at the innate ninth level for years, struggling to gain enlightenment.</p><p></p><p>Others had just recently reached the innate ninth level.</p><p></p><p>Now, all of them, under the influence of Ye Xiao's sword intent, had directly broken through.</p><p></p><p>The birth of one Patriarch after another left many dumbfounded and envious.</p><p></p><p>Because for the vast majority, they might never be able to break through to the Patriarch realm in their entire lives.</p><p></p><p>For many, the Great Patriarchs and Sage Patriarchs were their idols, and the Patriarch realm was the dream they pursued their whole lives! This also gave more people a clearer understanding of Ye Xiao's strength.</p><p></p><p>Ye Xiao, the Sword Immortal they admired, his strength was already capable of easily defeating the last one or two on the Dragon Ranking. His true strength was likely not inferior to the top thirty!</p><p></p><p>The Nine Provinces had once again produced a top-tier human expert!</p><p></p><p>This also excited and thrilled countless people.</p><p></p><p>In the sky above, the Sword Saint Lu Qingshan spoke two words in a slightly choked voice.</p><p></p><p>"Let's go."</p><p></p><p>Xian'er nodded.</p><p></p><p>His master's tone, was it a little emotional?</p><p></p><p>She knew that sword was incredibly powerful, powerful enough to even impress her, the arrogant and overbearing young miss.</p><p></p><p>But what kind of person was her master? The Sword Saint of the Nine Provinces!</p><p></p><p>He actually cried because of that sword?</p><p></p><p>In fact, what she didn't know was that Lu Qingshan was not crying, but rather, he was delighted.</p><p></p><p>Delighted that the Nine Provinces had produced such an extraordinary genius.</p><p></p><p>He had recognized that sword intent as belonging to the mysterious young man he had seen that day.</p><p></p><p>He just didn't expect the other party to be so strong! Before coming, he had planned to find Ye Xiao and impart all his lifetime of knowledge, to help the Nine Provinces create another legend.</p><p></p><p>But now, he no longer thought that way.</p><p></p><p>That child, he did not need Lu Qingshan's superfluous guidance.</p><p></p><p>He had already matured!</p>

        <div class="content">
            <p>Here is the full English translation of the Chinese excerpt:</p><p></p><p>Ye Xiao returned home and saw Huan Liuli trying on the new stockings she had just bought. There were several more packages, all brand new.</p><p></p><p>After Huan Liuli's cultivation reached the Xiantian Third Rank Grandmaster, her height had increased quite a bit, already reaching 1.23 meters, so she could wear them.</p><p></p><p>However, Ye Xiao glanced over and found that they were all luxury brand names, with prices not low at all. </p><p></p><p>A pair from Balenciaga cost a thousand or two! Even the more affordable Linyuan brand was not cheap, not something an ordinary working-class girl could afford.</p><p></p><p>Let alone the fact that Huan Liuli was just a silly cat without a job.</p><p></p><p>Ye Xiao couldn't help but frown slightly.</p><p></p><p>"Huan Liuli, did you steal something again?"</p><p></p><p>Huan Liuli glanced at him.</p><p></p><p>"Who's stealing? We haven't done that kind of thing for a long time now."</p><p></p><p>"Then where did these branded items come from? Don't tell me you found them."</p><p></p><p>"Of course I didn't find them, these were all bought for me by my online friends."</p><p></p><p>"Online friends?"</p><p></p><p>Ye Xiao's face showed some confusion, and Huan Liuli continued:</p><p></p><p>"Yes. I've been online recently and made a lot of online friends. It turns out that when I complained about not being able to afford clothes and having worn the same socks for over a year, they insisted on buying me new ones and asked me to send them the old ones."</p><p></p><p>Ye Xiao: "-?"</p><p></p><p>"And they really took them?"</p><p></p><p>"Of course, they were even fighting over who got to buy me new ones. I said I didn't want to, but they still wanted to send me money."</p><p></p><p>"What happened then?"</p><p></p><p>"I said I only had one pair, so they ended up buying me several pairs online. They told me to just wear them dirty and then mail them back, and they would help me wash them. And they would pay for the shipping too.</p><p></p><p>I thought, I can make money this way and get free clothes and socks to wear, and someone will even wash them for me, without me having to do it myself. How could I not agree?</p><p></p><p>Hey, Master, from now on I can make money too. You don't have to buy me breakfast anymore, just get me one beef bun, you're so stingy."</p><p></p><p>Ye Xiao: "(￢_￢)!"</p><p></p><p>He was simply speechless, how could there be such bizarre people in this world? And from what Huan Liuli said, there were quite a few of them.</p><p></p><p>He was really fed up.</p><p></p><p>But he didn't feel like managing Huan Liuli too much, just casually saying:</p><p></p><p>"Don't keep messing around with this kind of rubbish. You're a star beast, you should focus your main efforts on cultivation."</p><p></p><p>With that, he went upstairs.</p><p></p><p>Huan Liuli rolled her eyes behind him.</p><p></p><p>"The main job of a star beast is to eat people, have you let me eat any? Now I can earn money to support myself, and you still want to nag me. Just because you're the master doesn't mean I have to listen to you.</p><p></p><p>If you really annoy me, I'll put the socks I've worn in your tea cup every day!"</p><p></p><p>The next morning, Ye Xiao went to work as usual to attend the assessment.</p><p></p><p>The assessment was divided into two parts, the first part was the written test, which lasted only an hour and tested the understanding and operation of library work.</p><p></p><p>Occasionally there would be some tricky and bizarre questions.</p><p></p><p>For example: If you find male and female readers doing something against public morality in the library, what will you do? A: Peek at it yourself! B: Call your colleagues to come and peek too! C: Take photos and post them online! D: Participate in it! If you look closely at this question, it will lead you into a big trap.</p><p></p><p>First of all, all the answers are definitely wrong.</p><p></p><p>But some people, because they don't know how to answer, but don't want to give up the score of this question, will blindly guess one.</p><p></p><p>If that's the case, this question will definitely not get any points.</p><p></p><p>Because this question is actually testing the ability to judge right and wrong.</p><p></p><p>If you simply choose an answer for the sake of the score, your sense of responsibility will be seriously doubted.</p><p></p><p>Only those who don't choose will get the points.</p><p></p><p>Since the answer sheet is machine-graded, you can immediately know the score after putting it in.</p><p></p><p>Without a doubt, Ye Xiao's score ranked tenth.</p><p></p><p>He could have done first place, but being first would be too dazzling and draw too much attention, which didn't suit Ye Xiao's lifestyle, so he used the Taixuan Tiangong to quickly scan the papers of the others and deliberately crossed out a few correct answers to ensure his ranking was around tenth place.</p><p></p><p>This score, the written test, was basically no problem.</p><p></p><p>Next was the martial test, which was not a competition fight or anything, as they were all colleagues and afraid of hurting each other.</p><p></p><p>So they just needed to test the cultivation level.</p><p></p><p>Ye Xiao suppressed his cultivation to the Xiantian Third Rank.</p><p></p><p>Not too much, not too little, with this cultivation level and the written test score, his chance of staying was 99.999%.</p><p></p><p>As for the remaining 0.001%, he didn't care.</p><p></p><p>If he really had that 0.001% chance of being the lucky one, it meant even the heavens didn't want him to stay.</p><p></p><p>However, Ye Xiao's analysis proved to be perfect.</p><p></p><p>The entire library had two-thirds of the people laid off, leaving only one-third.</p><p></p><p>He, had just...</p><p></p><p>Here is the full English translation of the Chinese excerpt:</p><p></p><p>It just so happened that I ranked fourth in the end.</p><p></p><p>My results were able to meet the qualification requirements, and would not lead to too much speculation. What surprised Ye Xiao was that Wang Na, an old employee of over 20 years, actually failed and had to be transferred to another position.</p><p></p><p>Her martial arts cultivation was at the innate fourth rank, and the written test questions should not have been too difficult for her.</p><p></p><p>Yet she was still eliminated, which really surprised Ye Xiao.</p><p></p><p>"Congratulations! Little Ye, you're a dark horse. I didn't expect the assessment this time to be so difficult, but you still passed."</p><p></p><p>Ye Xiao responded calmly:</p><p></p><p>"Thank you. However, it's quite regrettable that Sister Wang didn't make it."</p><p></p><p>Wang Na smiled.</p><p></p><p>"During the written test, I intentionally did poorly. I'm about to get married, so I didn't want to compete with you young kids anymore. I've already discussed with the director to use some connections to transfer me to my future husband's unit, so we may not see each other as often going forward."</p><p></p><p>Ye Xiao nodded.</p><p></p><p>"Then I wish you a lifelong happy marriage."</p><p></p><p>"Thank you for the kind words. I'm going to handle the transfer procedures now. But you also need to work hard, as the library expansion likely won't be as easy-going as it is now."</p><p></p><p>"Mm."</p><p></p><p>After bidding farewell, Ye Xiao went to handle the procedures to remain in his position.</p><p></p><p>His job had not changed.</p><p></p><p>As one of the senior employees of the library, and with his good written test results, Ouyang Yunzhong had kept his position.</p><p></p><p>Many others had dropped from management roles down to clerical or librarian positions.</p><p></p><p>After these arrangements, the only thing left was the library expansion.</p><p></p><p>Even though construction in this world was quite fast, expanding a large library would still take a significant amount of time.</p><p></p><p>Therefore, Ye Xiao was granted about a week of vacation.</p><p></p><p>How annoying!</p><p></p><p>Ye Xiao was not at all interested in vacations, and compared to taking time off, he preferred to read books, as that would allow him to improve his cultivation faster.</p><p></p><p>But since he was on vacation, he could only stay at home.</p><p></p><p>During this time, Ye Xiao noticed that many companies were also expanding, and had set up stronger formations.</p><p></p><p>In the suburbs of Jianghai City, new communities and companies were also starting to be built.</p><p></p><p>Even the construction company next to Ye Xiao's house had started fencing off land to build houses.</p><p></p><p>It seemed that not only the library was being expanded, but the entire city of Jianghai was undergoing expansion.</p><p></p><p>Thinking about it carefully, the library was the foundation of a city. The scale of the library was built according to the size of the city, so if the library was being expanded, the city must be expanding as well.</p><p></p><p>But Ye Xiao was not interested in these matters. </p><p></p><p>The city's expansion would only drive up housing prices. The only thing he was interested in was what new books the library expansion would bring.</p><p></p><p>Before the library reopened, Ye Xiao went to some small bookstores that required payment, to browse and absorb some basic cultivation techniques, in preparation for synthesizing new techniques.</p><p></p><p>The small bookstores naturally couldn't match the collection of the library, but they had their own advantages.</p><p></p><p>Just like how high-end salons and roadside hair salons differ greatly in level, who can guarantee you won't find some surprises in the small hair salon?</p><p></p><p>The only difference is that the high-end salons have an abundance of abalone, while the small hair salons may only catch a fleeting glimpse of scallops.</p><p></p><p>It all depends on whether you have the luck to find them.</p><p></p><p>In this world, there are also often people who stumble upon a grandmaster-level cultivation technique in a small bookstore, and become a powerful expert as a result.</p><p></p><p>Ye Xiao was not interested in grandmaster-level techniques, he only cared about the fundamental basics. </p><p></p><p>As long as it was the original foundation of a technique, belonging to the Golden Book Shen Huan without any imprints, it would be worth more to him than a grandmaster technique by a hundredfold.</p><p></p><p>After browsing for two to three days, Ye Xiao also obtained a basic fist technique and a basic palm technique, which was not a bad harvest.</p><p></p><p>In addition to reading cultivation techniques, Ye Xiao would occasionally flip through other non-technique books to rest his mind.</p><p></p><p>Among these, he discovered a legendary tale that greatly intrigued him.</p><p></p><p>It is well known that there are emperors in the human world.</p><p></p><p>But why are they able to become emperors? After all, throughout history until now, there have been very few emperors.</p><p></p><p>The emperors mentioned here are not referring to those who inherited the throne, but rather the peak existences who could lead the human race and avert calamity.</p><p></p><p>For example, the Three Sovereigns and Five Emperors, or the Ancestral Dragon of the Qin Dynasty, the Sui Emperor, the Tang Ancestor - were they merely superior in natural talent, or had they cultivated deeply enough?</p><p></p><p>Clearly, it was not that simple.</p><p></p><p>Among the powerful figures of the past and present, there were many whose cultivation reached a level comparable to the emperors, not a small number.</p><p></p><p>Such as the Killing God Bai Qi, or the Hegemon-King Xiang Yu - they were all figures of unparalleled brilliance.</p><p></p><p>Their cultivation speed and attainments were not inferior to those imperial heirs.</p><p></p><p>Then why was it that only a small group of them ultimately became emperors?</p>

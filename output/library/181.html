        <h1>Chapter 181</h1>
        <div class="content">
            <p>Here is the full English translation of the Chinese excerpt:</p><p></p><p>Ye Xiao immediately opened the webpage.</p><p></p><p>He really wanted to know who this imperial bloodline was? Previously, he had thought about whether he himself might become the imperial bloodline? If he couldn't become the imperial bloodline, then he could befriend the one who had awakened the imperial bloodline, and they could be good friends.</p><p></p><p>This way, he would also have a very powerful friend.</p><p></p><p>Among his current friends, they were all ordinary people, and Liu Chengxun, strictly speaking, was not really his friend.</p><p></p><p>They had just met today.</p><p></p><p>If he encountered major trouble, for example, if he accidentally provoked some Boundary realm expert, Liu Chengxun probably wouldn't come to his aid.</p><p></p><p>Moreover, even if Liu Chengxun was his friend, it wouldn't be of much use.</p><p></p><p>Because if the opponent was someone that even he couldn't handle, then Liu Chengxun going up would be in vain, just sending him to his death.</p><p></p><p>As for the imperial bloodline, it would be different.</p><p></p><p>According to the various legends so far, the future growth of the imperial bloodline is limitless.</p><p></p><p>It is very likely to become a legendary Emperor Realm existence.</p><p></p><p>Even if it's not the Emperor Realm, the Boundary Realm is absolutely a guaranteed bottom line.</p><p></p><p>Moreover, the other party is in Jianghai City, and the chances of him becoming good friends with the other party are very high!</p><p></p><p>"I heard that the few who previously activated the imperial bloodline in the Nine Provinces have all been secretly protected, and their cultivation speed is very fast.</p><p></p><p>The one in Jianghai City right now, although he has just stepped into the Patriarch Realm, the Nine Provinces will certainly use resources to vigorously cultivate him.</p><p></p><p>I suppose his cultivation speed will also be very fast."</p><p></p><p>But when Ye Xiao opened his phone and confirmed the other party's identity, he was immediately dumbfounded, feeling a sense of being poisoned.</p><p></p><p>"This, this can't be a joke, right? How is that possible?"</p><p></p><p>This imperial bloodline turned out to be none other than his old acquaintance - Qin Yuyan!</p><p></p><p>Why her?</p><p></p><p>At this moment, even if Ye Xiao's mentality was good, he couldn't bear it.</p><p></p><p>Truly poisonous! Why her?</p><p></p><p>Aside from being a bit pretty, having a little bit of meat, and long legs, what else does she have? What else does she have?</p><p></p><p>In terms of cultivation, her cultivation is not good; in terms of intelligence, she is mediocre; in terms of talent, the Nine Provinces have countless geniuses stronger than her. Not to mention, just randomly throwing a brick in the direction of Jingzhou, Hucheng, or Guangcheng could crush a group of talents stronger than her.</p><p></p><p>Why does she deserve to awaken the imperial bloodline? Ye Xiao is really jealous of her.</p><p></p><p>If the other party was a genius even more outstanding than Pao Jiansheng, he would certainly not feel it was unreasonable, he might be a little envious, but he would also feel it was reasonable.</p><p></p><p>But the other party just happened to be Qin Yuyan.</p><p></p><p>He couldn't just feel she was a suitable candidate just because she was his friend, he had to be honest.</p><p></p><p>Qin Yuyan is really trash.</p><p></p><p>After all, this is the activation of the imperial bloodline, not child's play, this is to select a supreme powerhouse in advance for the people of the Nine Provinces! Even if Qin Yuyan is not necessarily the one who will ultimately become the emperor, she is one of the few candidates who have the qualifications to participate!</p><p></p><p>Could it be that this selection of the Nine Provinces' heavenly mandate, the so-called holy sons and holy daughters, is not based on their talents, but purely a matter of luck? But Qin Yuyan doesn't look like someone with good luck at all! If you say she has good pregnancy aura, Ye Xiao might believe it more.</p><p></p><p>What great fortune does she have?</p><p></p><p>In her first blind date, she didn't even see the face of her blind date partner, and she went to a motel with him.</p><p></p><p>What a loser!</p><p></p><p>Ye Xiao was very depressed as he browsed the forum to see what the netizens were talking about.</p><p></p><p>"Celebrating across the world, our Jianghai City has actually awakened an imperial bloodline, a holy maiden has appeared!"</p><p></p><p>"Qin Yuyan, she is truly the number one genius of our Jianghai City. At the young age of 21, she has already broken through to the Patriarch Realm, even younger than Pao Jiansheng!"</p><p></p><p>"Really impressive, no wonder, before, she was able to comprehend that sword intent from the sword marks left by Senior Sword Immortal, her talent is amazing!"</p><p></p><p>"It can also be said that after she comprehended that sword intent, it led to the improvement of her cultivation, and then she awakened the imperial bloodline.</p><p></p><p>From this perspective, she has also benefited from the glory of Senior Sword Immortal.</p><p></p><p>Senior Sword Immortal is the GOAT!"</p><p></p><p>After reading these, Ye Xiao's heart had a little more understanding.</p><p></p><p>Qin Yuyan's trash is only relative to himself.</p><p></p><p>But in fact, her cultivation speed is still very fast among ordinary people.</p><p></p><p>After extracting that sword intent from his sword marks, a normal person would not be able to comprehend it so quickly, it might take several years, or even dozens of years, to fully comprehend it.</p><p></p><p>But she, in just a few months, had already fully comprehended the sword intent he left for her.</p><p></p><p>From this perspective, she is still stronger than many people.</p><p></p><p>A 21-year-old innate Saint Master is not bad either.</p><p></p><p>Ye Xiao had previously seen online that a super expert like Sword Saint Lu Qingshan broke through to the innate realm at the age of 19!</p><p></p><p>Liu Chengxun broke through to the innate realm when he was already 23 years old.</p><p></p><p>Even if you take away his sword intent and let her start cultivating the sword art she likes from a young age, instead of the sword technique, she would probably be able to break through to the innate Saint Master realm around 22 or 23 years old.</p><p></p><p>Liu Chengxun is already one of the top 50 experts in the world, excluding the Star Battlefield.</p><p></p><p>If Qin Yuyan is not weaker than him, she may also have the potential to become one of the top 50 experts in the future.</p><p></p><p>Moreover, there is one more point, Lu Qingshan had his own master guiding him from a young age, and Liu Chengxun was also taught by the former Sword Saint of Hanzhou.</p><p></p><p>As for Qin Yuyan...</p><p></p><p>Here is the full English translation of the Chinese excerpt:</p><p></p><p>Yan, without anyone teaching her, her talent is already almost on par with his. If he had given her the Dao Intent a little earlier, perhaps she could have caught up to Lu Qingshan's record of reaching the Primordial Saint-Emperor Realm. Thinking about it, that does seem quite reasonable.</p><p></p><p>However, this has also completely shattered Ye Xiao's illusions about the Emperor.</p><p></p><p>According to the current situation, Ye Xiao made a prediction that even if Qin Yuyan opened the Emperor's bloodline and had the full support of the resources of the Nine Provinces, it would still take her nearly 30 years to break through to the Divine Monarch Realm.</p><p></p><p>Lu Qingshan broke through to the Primordial Saint-Emperor Realm at exactly 30 years old, and Qin Yuyan is around the same age range.</p><p></p><p>But Ye Xiao is already at the Primordial Saint-Emperor Eighth Realm. His plan is to break through to the Primordial Saint-Emperor Ninth Realm in just a few months.</p><p></p><p>By then, he will be able to start assaulting the King Realm. No matter how difficult the King Realm is, he will definitely break through much earlier than Qin Yuyan.</p><p></p><p>By the time Qin Yuyan reaches the King Realm, Ye Xiao may have already reached the legendary Emperor Realm.</p><p></p><p>Relying on her to help him if he encounters difficulties? Forget it.</p><p></p><p>Getting excited for nothing.</p><p></p><p>The Emperor's bloodline is just that simple.</p><p></p><p>Shaking his head, Ye Xiao pushed this matter out of his mind. He had originally wanted to play with his phone for a while, but now he had no interest in it, as most of the online discussions were about this matter.</p><p></p><p>There were no other interesting websites to browse either.</p><p></p><p>So he decided to check the storage rings he obtained from the City Lord of South Mountain City and the Demon God Alliance Leader.</p><p></p><p>He would start with the City Lord of South Mountain City's storage ring, as it was his habit to consume the less valuable items first and save the best for last.</p><p></p><p>The storage ring of the City Lord of South Mountain City was quite small, but it contained seven or eight cubic meters of space.</p><p></p><p>A storage ring of this size was already quite valuable.</p><p></p><p>It seems this City Lord had not been stingy in exploiting the common people, and had also colluded with the Beastmen. Ye Xiao felt no regret in eliminating him.</p><p></p><p>When Ye Xiao's gaze fell upon the contents of the storage ring, his expression couldn't help but tighten.</p><p></p><p>Good stuff! Three hundred pounds of Thousand-Year Frost Iron, an excellent material for forging weapons.</p><p></p><p>There were also over a hundred Grandmaster-level spirit cores, including several from Great Grandmasters. This was not of much use to Ye Xiao, but it would be a huge fortune for an ordinary city lord.</p><p></p><p>There were also six hundred and twenty pounds of Purple Gold, another top-tier material for weapon forging. Although not as precious as Thousand-Year Frost Iron, its value was still considerable.</p><p></p><p>The other miscellaneous items were either precious materials, rare elixirs, or weapons.</p><p></p><p>It could be said that, not counting the storage ring itself, the value of the items inside was already close to 10 billion! </p><p></p><p>Adding in the storage ring, the total value easily exceeded 10 billion! Ye Xiao never expected this small City Lord of South Mountain City to bring him such a substantial income.</p><p></p><p>Next, Ye Xiao turned his attention to the storage ring of the Demon God Alliance Leader.</p><p></p><p>Compared to the City Lord of South Mountain City's storage ring, the Demon God Alliance Leader's was definitely much stronger, and more than just a single fold stronger.</p><p></p><p>Her storage ring had a bottom area the size of two football fields, and a height of over 6 meters.</p><p></p><p>This storage space was already terrifyingly large, reaching half the size of Ye Xiao's own storage ring.</p><p></p><p>This did not mean that the Demon God Alliance Leader, as a powerful expert, was using a more shabby storage ring than Ye Xiao's. </p><p></p><p>In fact, there were many types of spatial materials in this world. But not all forgemasters had Ye Xiao's level of skill to compress so much spatial force into a small storage ring.</p><p></p><p>The Demon God Alliance Leader's storage ring was also made of Purple Crystal, and was even a bit larger than Ye Xiao's. The only difference was that the forgemaster who crafted it was not as skilled.</p><p></p><p>Ye Xiao estimated that he could combine these two storage rings and further expand the storage capacity of his own ring.</p><p></p><p>Next, he would take a look at what treasures were stored in the Demon God Alliance Leader's ring.</p><p></p><p>So he immersed his mind into it.</p><p></p><p>Ye Xiao: "(!?)"</p><p></p><p>So much! </p><p></p><p>So many materials!</p><p></p><p>Rare Meteorite Iron, even more precious than Thousand-Year Frost Iron, with a price five times higher, and in short supply.</p><p></p><p>And there was about as much as a small car in this ring!</p><p></p><p>Blood-Red Jade, which could make weapons and armor absorb the opponent's blood energy during battle, enhancing their power until the fight ended. This material was strictly prohibited from being sold in the Nine Provinces and the entire world, only available for special supply to the Star Battlefield.</p><p></p><p>There were at least ten cubic meters of it!</p><p></p><p>(Chapter end)</p>

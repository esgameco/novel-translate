        <h1>Chapter 265</h1>
        <div class="content">
            <p>Here is the full English translation of the Chinese excerpt:</p><p></p><p>The million-strong blood clan fled, with the sound of countless wings flapping, making the entire valley hum.</p><p></p><p>That tiger roar had already made them lose all their will to fight.</p><p></p><p>And right after that tiger roar, a slightly hoarse but no less powerful voice than the other party's quietly came.</p><p></p><p>"Zhenxing Tiger, you're showing off your might to me? What's the meaning of this?"</p><p></p><p>Zhenxing Tiger smiled calmly.</p><p></p><p>"Your dog is ignorant! I'll help you discipline them, let them learn some rules."</p><p></p><p>"Hmph!"</p><p></p><p>A cold snort, and the black jade coffin hanging above the Jesus statue in the center of the church quietly descended, standing steadily on the cross.</p><p></p><p>Accompanied by the coffin lid's dissipation, a monster with bat wings on its back, crystalline transparent skin emitting a faint blue glow, and sharp fangs quietly walked out.</p><p></p><p>It stepped through the air as if there were stairs, slowly stepping forward to stand before Zhenxing Tiger.</p><p></p><p>"The holy war has not yet begun, why are you not staying in the starry sky battlefield but coming down to the ground? What are you doing?"</p><p></p><p>"My few subordinates were ambushed on the ground, and I need you to lend a hand."</p><p></p><p>The other party narrowed his eyes slightly, his blood-red demonic pupils continuously pulsing with scarlet light.</p><p></p><p>"The holy war has not yet begun, why would your subordinates appear on the ground? And they were ambushed? The ones who could ambush them must be at least at the half-step Monarch Realm, right?"</p><p></p><p>"You don't need to ask too much about that. Your task is just to help me find them. After the task is accomplished, I will definitely repay you handsomely. Will you do it?"</p><p></p><p>"Since you, Zhenxing Tiger, have come to me in person, and we are both under Lord Lin's command, I, Bloodwing, cannot refuse you this favor.</p><p></p><p>Tell me, where were they ambushed?"</p><p></p><p>"The Nine States."</p><p></p><p>The air fell into a moment of silence.</p><p></p><p>"What's wrong?"</p><p></p><p>Zhenxing Tiger felt slightly puzzled, while Bloodwing casually spoke:</p><p></p><p>"What did you just say?"</p><p></p><p>"The Nine States, what's wrong?"</p><p></p><p>"The sentence before that."</p><p></p><p>"I said if you help me find them, I will definitely repay you handsomely. Will you do it?"</p><p></p><p>"No! I still need to meditate and cultivate, waiting for the holy war to begin, to go through fire and water for Lord Lin, I cannot accompany you."</p><p></p><p>With that, Bloodwing turned to leave.</p><p></p><p>A flash of murderous intent appeared in Zhenxing Tiger's gaze, and he raised his hand, a tiger claw rushing down towards Bloodwing's shoulder, as if a thunderous tiger roar could be heard in the void.</p><p></p><p>Even more terrifying was that due to the overwhelming power, the entire church was shattered to powder by this strike, only the black jade coffin remaining suspended in the air, unharmed.</p><p></p><p>"You dare to trick me?"</p><p></p><p>"You were the one who tricked me first. Is the Nine States a place that anyone can go to at will?</p><p></p><p>Didn't you go and inquire about it? That is the birthplace of the human martial dao in this world, with powerful experts and countless masters.</p><p></p><p>Without saying much else, just the Four Sages of the Nine States alone firmly occupy the top two positions on the Dragon and Phoenix Rankings of this world.</p><p></p><p>They are all peak Monarch Realm experts!</p><p></p><p>If you go to the Nine States and provoke them, even though we are both Monarch Realm experts, we still won't have a chance to survive.</p><p></p><p>I can accompany you anywhere you want to go, but the Nine States is the one place I cannot go."</p><p></p><p>A chilling aura emanated from Zhenxing Tiger's pupils.</p><p></p><p>"You have to go, whether you want to or not! You have no choice. Otherwise, I can crush your head right now.</p><p></p><p>Don't think that just because we are both divine beast existences, if I want to kill you, you can't escape!"</p><p></p><p>"Zhenxing Tiger, you dare! As fellow grand generals under Lord Lin, if you kill me, Lord Lin will not let you off."</p><p></p><p>"Do you think I dare not?"</p><p></p><p>Zhenxing Tiger unleashed his power, and the ethereal tiger claw directly tore off half of Bloodwing's shoulder.</p><p></p><p>"Ahhh!"</p><p></p><p>Bloodwing let out a miserable scream, and the chill in his heart also reached an extreme.</p><p></p><p>His terrifying face finally revealed a hint of fear.</p><p></p><p>"Alright, I'll agree to it then. But just the two of us going to the Nine States would be too risky.</p><p></p><p>We need to plan this carefully."</p><p></p><p>"You've been in this world longer than me. What ideas do you have? Just say them directly."</p><p></p><p>Zhenxing Tiger threw the arm in his hand to Bloodwing, who reattached it without much care, and the blood veins quickly spread, rapidly healing.</p><p></p><p>Reaching his level of strength and living for so long, his brain wouldn't be that stupid.</p><p></p><p>Quarreling over an arm is not worth it.</p><p></p><p>Most importantly, Zhenxing Tiger is so strong that he really can't defeat him.</p><p></p><p>"You should know about dragon veins, right?"</p><p></p><p>Zhenxing Tiger nodded.</p><p></p><p>In the starry sky, there are no shortage of dragon veins. Wherever spiritual energy gathers, dragon veins will eventually form.</p><p></p><p>"The dragon veins in this world are already scarce, but there are still a few in the Western region where we are.</p><p></p><p>You follow me to completely excavate those dragon veins.</p><p></p><p>The instantaneous power unleashed by a dragon vein is enough to allow our cultivation to make a substantial breakthrough in a short time.</p><p></p><p>If we can bring the dragon veins with us, I...</p><p></p><p>Here is my translation of the Chinese excerpt you provided:</p><p></p><p>The two of us together will have the confidence to enter the Nine States.</p><p></p><p>The Trembling Star Tiger's eyes flickered slightly.</p><p></p><p>"You want to use me to help you obtain the Dragon Veins and refine your own strength, don't you?"</p><p></p><p>Blood Wings smiled.</p><p></p><p>"So what if that's the case? You want me to help you find your subordinates, so you'll have to give me some benefits in return.</p><p></p><p>Furthermore, what I said is the truth. </p><p></p><p>In the past, I was injured by a sword qi from the Sword Sovereign of the Nine States, and I have not fully recovered until now. </p><p></p><p>Only the power of the Dragon Veins can heal me, so that I can fully unleash my true strength and better help you find your subordinates."</p><p></p><p>After a pause, he continued:</p><p></p><p>"Moreover, the Holy War is imminent. We two should seize these Dragon Veins in advance - that would be a great harvest.</p><p></p><p>Once the Holy War begins and the gods descend, it will not be so easy to seize these Dragon Veins."</p><p></p><p>The Trembling Star Tiger's brow furrowed slightly.</p><p></p><p>"How is the defense in the western part of the Human Realm?"</p><p></p><p>"Don't worry, I know what I'm doing. The strength of the western world is far inferior to the Nine States. With the two of us, divine beast-level existences working together, seizing these Dragon Veins will not be a problem at all.</p><p></p><p>Then when we go to the Nine States, relying on the power of the Dragon Veins, the two of us will be able to enter as if into a land with no one in it! Won't that be wonderful?"</p><p></p><p>"Good! Then let's act quickly. I can still feel the vitality of my subordinates, but if we delay any longer, I'm afraid they may be in danger."</p><p></p><p>Blood Wings chuckled.</p><p></p><p>"You really are the Tiger God, with a heart as vast as the clouds. If it were someone else, who would care so much about a few subordinates? But you don't need to worry too much. They might have just found a place to hide, and now they could be living comfortably, eating the best spiritual herbs and enjoying the precious treasures, maybe even getting fatter."</p><p></p><p>"I hope that's the case."</p><p></p><p>On Ye Xiao's side, after cultivating in the formation, he had perfectly solved the problem of his spiritual energy supply. The remaining time was spent entirely on reading books.</p><p></p><p>Ye Xiao had finally synthesized the last and strongest imperial art in his physical attack repertoire - the Warrior God's Powerful Kick! Its power surpassed even the Great Annihilation Fist and the Infinite Calamity Finger. Although the Great Annihilation Fist and Infinite Calamity Finger were also single-target attacks, they were mainly focused on instantaneous release. The Warrior God's Powerful Kick, on the other hand, could be charged up, allowing the attack power to exceed one's cultivation level.</p><p></p><p>This was similar in principle to the Emperor's Extreme Sword Technique.</p><p></p><p>This move should be considered one of the two final imperial arts Ye Xiao had synthesized.</p><p></p><p>The other one was an eye technique.</p><p></p><p>Ye Xiao's cultivation methods could now be divided into two main categories:</p><p></p><p>One was the auxiliary and enhancement type that used weapons like swords and knives as the attack method.</p><p>He had only cultivated two of these - a sword technique and a knife technique.</p><p></p><p>The other category was the one that used the body, soul, and spirit as the attack method.</p><p>This included fist techniques, finger techniques, leg techniques, claw techniques, spiritual techniques, and eye techniques.</p><p></p><p>Since he had refined his body and spirit to the extreme, if he did not learn these techniques based on the body and spirit as the foundation, it would be a waste.</p><p></p><p>Moreover, Ye Xiao was considering a problem - after synthesizing techniques above the Slaughter God Art, it might no longer be possible to fuse similar techniques.</p><p></p><p>In that case, would it be possible to fuse the sword and knife techniques, as well as fuse the fist, leg, finger, and Diamond Indestructible Divine Skill-type techniques focused on body refinement?</p><p></p><p>It was necessary to make plans for the future in advance. Otherwise, if he had to come back and practice these basic techniques later, that would be torture.</p><p></p><p>After mastering the final eye technique, Ye Xiao's focus would no longer be on these basic cultivation methods, but on fully refining the imperial arts at the Patriarch level to synthesize the Slaughter God Art!</p><p></p><p>After continuous cultivation over several days, Ye Xiao finally synthesized the second Slaughter God Art-level cultivation method - the Eternal Life Sutra, a healing technique.</p><p></p><p>However, when Ye Xiao saw the "Healing God Art" mark in the lower right corner of the record of the cultivation method, he couldn't help but be puzzled.</p><p></p><p>This thing is called the Healing God Art? </p><p></p><p>Does that mean it's a healing technique for Healing God Realm cultivators?</p><p></p><p>The battle technique is called the Slaughter God Art, and the healing technique is called the Healing God Art. Couldn't they just call it the God Art and be done with it? Why come up with so many fancy names, as if trying to show off, when in the end it just falls into the cliché.</p><p></p><p>Oh well, let them name it however they want. The cultivation method is still very powerful, so Ye Xiao should try out the Eternal Life Sutra and see how strong it is.</p><p></p><p>Ye Xiao wouldn't find some low-level cultivators to experiment on, because with their low cultivation, the healing effect would naturally be better, and the experimental data would not be very meaningful for his actual combat effectiveness.</p><p></p><p>So Ye Xiao decided to use his own body to experiment.</p><p></p><p>A flash of a blade, followed by a thud, and his arm fell to the ground.</p><p></p><p>One more update, three thousand words.</p><p></p><p>Please vote and subscribe. </p><p></p><p>Thank you to readers Kuang Jue Fei Fu Jia, 20190801214430942, Wang Yin Shen Shi, Chris, and Yue Liang for your donations, greatly appreciated.</p><p></p><p>(This chapter is complete)</p>

        <h1>Chapter 350</h1>
        <div class="content">
            <p>Here is the full English translation of the Chinese excerpt:</p><p></p><p>"If I were to give you all of it, it would greatly reduce the time that your ancestral spirits can remain. "</p><p></p><p>"Haha, the fact that you even have this consideration is enough for us. "</p><p></p><p>"Back in the day, we traversed the starry skies, all for the sake of creating a future for our descendants. </p><p></p><p>Now that we see this future being realized through you, what more is there for us to hesitate about? If you were to refuse, that would be the greatest cruelty to us."</p><p></p><p>Hearing these words, Ye Xiao let out a long sigh. </p><p></p><p>In this moment, even though he was meeting these ancestors for the first time, he couldn't help but feel deeply moved.</p><p></p><p>Throughout his journey, there had been so many people helping him.</p><p></p><p>The Tyrant King, the powerful experts from the Nine Provinces over the ages, the Cloud Emperor, and the Scenery Emperor - they had all been silently dedicating themselves for his sake.</p><p></p><p>And there were also those close friends who constantly worried for him.</p><p></p><p>Suddenly, Ye Xiao began to feel that the most precious thing he had gained in this world was not his current powerful cultivation, but rather, all this heartfelt care and gratitude!</p><p></p><p>"Descendant of the Xuanyuan Clan, Ye Xiao, I am grateful for the favor of my ancestors. In this lifetime, I will surely ascend to the heavens and establish a great name, bringing glory to this lineage."</p><p></p><p>"Good! Good! These words from you are enough!"</p><p></p><p>"I'll go first, Xuanyuan Clan's Ye Fei, refining the divine blood, rise!"</p><p></p><p>"I'll go too, Xuanyuan Clan's Ye Zhan Tian, refining the divine blood, rise!"</p><p></p><p>"Xuanyuan Clan's Meng Qian Yao, refining the divine blood, rise!"</p><p></p><p>"Xuanyuan Clan's Sun Zhu Yun, refining the divine blood, rise!"</p><p></p><p>One ancestor after another began to refine their divine blood.</p><p></p><p>They did not harbor any hopes of being revived.</p><p></p><p>For death due to the natural course of life is part of the natural laws, and even if the death was unnatural and the lifespan extended, it would still be affected by those natural laws.</p><p></p><p>At the Divine Realm level, even healing arts could not completely reverse the natural laws.</p><p></p><p>But their dedication was still greatly admirable to Ye Xiao, for even if affected by the natural laws, with a physical body present, their divine spirits would be able to exist for a longer time compared to having no physical body at all.</p><p></p><p>Twenty-three clan members, one by one, refined their divine blood and infused it into Ye Xiao's body.</p><p></p><p>This caused Ye Xiao to feel his divine blood rapidly increasing, reaching terrifying levels in the blink of an eye.</p><p></p><p>From the original 120,000 drops, it quickly rose to 180,000, 240,000, 300,000, 400,000, 500,000, and in the blink of an eye, it had surpassed 1 million, continuing to increase without end.</p><p></p><p>As his divine blood kept rising, Ye Xiao felt his physical strength also increasing endlessly.</p><p></p><p>He felt every part of his body undergoing frenzied strengthening.</p><p></p><p>His five senses and six consciousnesses were all continuously enhancing due to the bodily improvements.</p><p></p><p>Suddenly, his eyes erupted with a dazzling golden light, and the Taiji True Eyes within underwent a mysterious transformation.</p><p></p><p>The ancestors' expressions changed, and they exclaimed excitedly, "Good lad, his physique has been enhanced, and he's even awakened the divine eyes!"</p><p></p><p>"This young man has too many cultivation methods, and he's likely cultivated eye techniques. Combined with Qian Yao and Zhu Yun's family bloodlines that possess divine eyes, he's accidentally triggered the awakening of the divine eyes.</p><p></p><p>From now on, he has gained another formidable technique."</p><p></p><p>Ye Xiao himself hadn't expected to accidentally activate the divine eyes in this way.</p><p></p><p>Divine eyes and eye techniques were different.</p><p></p><p>Eye techniques were developed by ordinary people to simulate the effects of divine eyes, but their power was incomparable to the purity of true divine eyes.</p><p></p><p>Naturally awakened divine eyes not only possessed unique eye techniques, but would also continue to improve as one's cultivation advanced.</p><p></p><p>Soon, Ye Xiao's pupils turned into a pure purple color, without any patterns, but the aura of his gaze was now several times more powerful than when he had used the Taiji True Eyes before.</p><p></p><p>"Such powerful eye force! This divine eye is no ordinary one!"</p><p></p><p>The two women couldn't help but exclaim.</p><p></p><p>The other ancestors couldn't help but ask curiously:</p><p></p><p>"What's so special about his divine eyes?"</p><p></p><p>"Of course there's something special." </p><p></p><p>Zhu Yun spoke up solemnly to explain:</p><p></p><p>"The greater the power, the simpler it becomes. Look closely at his eyes, do you see any patterns in them? Are they not extremely pure?"</p><p></p><p>"That's right."</p><p></p><p>"This means his eyes are of extremely high quality, but exactly which type, I'm not sure. Qian Yao, do you have any impressions?"</p><p></p><p>Meng Qian Yao shook her head.</p><p></p><p>"I've never seen this kind of eyes before. Although Zhu Yun and I both have divine eyes, our levels are very low, not even worthy of mention within the Xuanyuan Clan, let alone in the entire starry skies.</p><p></p><p>If he wants to know the level of this divine eye, I'll have to go find those top-tier existences, at least at the Divine King realm, to get a clear answer."</p><p></p><p>"Whew!"</p><p></p><p>The crowd couldn't help but take a deep breath of cold air.</p><p></p><p>Divine King realm! That was an existence they didn't even dare to imagine.</p><p></p><p>The strongest among them were still at the Divine Realm, not even reaching the level of Slaying Gods.</p><p></p><p>Here is the full English translation of the Chinese excerpt:</p><p></p><p>The cultivation of the realm had not surpassed them, let alone the Godking Realm! However, this only made the crowd even more excited.</p><p></p><p>The stronger Ye Xiao's strength became, the more it was a good thing for them.</p><p></p><p>"Qian Yao, then you see, his eyes, how far do you think they can evolve?"</p><p></p><p>The reason why the Divine Eyes were so powerful was that they could evolve, especially the high-grade Divine Eyes, which could even evolve into Treasure Art-level existences.</p><p></p><p>That would be truly extraordinary!</p><p></p><p>Qian Yao shook her head.</p><p></p><p>"This I cannot confirm, saying too much may seem a bit exaggerated. But at least, as long as they are cultivated well, their power will definitely not be weaker than the Nine-Star Divine Arts.</p><p></p><p>As for metamorphosing and evolving into Treasure Art, that will depend on his fortune."</p><p></p><p>"Good!"</p><p></p><p>The crowd clenched their fists, this divine blood, at least it had not been in vain, creating such a powerful descendant, which was exactly what they had been dreaming of.</p><p></p><p>Their divine blood was the ancestral blood of Ye Xiao's body, so the genes of both parties were completely highly overlapping, and in the blink of an eye, it was quickly refined and continuously transformed into Ye Xiao's own fresh blood.</p><p></p><p>At this moment, because his physique was too strong, the speed of absorbing spiritual energy had also started to surge.</p><p></p><p>When he absorbed spiritual energy, the spiritual energy, because it was suddenly gathered too much, was like two streams of water, going in and out, in and out, in and out, in his nose, in a cyclic manner.</p><p></p><p>It took nearly half a day before Ye Xiao finally completed the refinement.</p><p></p><p>When his consciousness regained clarity, the ancestors immediately gathered around him.</p><p></p><p>"Ye Xiao, how do you feel?"</p><p></p><p>Ye Xiao clenched his fist.</p><p></p><p>"Now I feel that my physique and control over the surroundings have reached a realm that is infinitely close to perfection."</p><p></p><p>"Congratulations, you are now infinitely close to the Divine Realm, worthy of being called a Half-Step Divine Realm existence. As long as you find a place with extremely dense spiritual energy to support your tribulation, you will be able to smoothly break through to the Divine Realm."</p><p></p><p>"However, although you can now break through to the Divine Realm, you must remember, it is best to find a hidden place. Your physique and divine soul are too powerful, and the commotion caused by your advancement to the Divine Realm will not be small.</p><p></p><p>At least not in this world. It will not only bring harm to this world, but it will also be easily noticed by the people of the major divine clans."</p><p></p><p>"And your eyes, no matter what, do not casually show your eyes to others unless it is a life-or-death situation.</p><p></p><p>Your eyes are now extremely precious, and once you show them to others, it will be a fatal disaster."</p><p></p><p>"To be precise, you are now a treasure trove. The divine soul is a treasure, the eyes are a treasure, and your physique is also a treasure, containing who knows how much divine blood.</p><p></p><p>So, try to be as low-key as possible.</p><p>Try not to cause trouble. Focus on cultivation first, and try to improve your strength as much as possible. Once you have the power to protect yourself, then you can go out and wander."</p><p></p><p>Ye Xiao nodded.</p><p></p><p>"The teachings of the ancestors, Ye Xiao will remember them in his heart."</p><p></p><p>The crowd smiled contentedly.</p><p></p><p>"Good! If that's the case, then you can go out. In the future, if there's nothing important, don't come back. The Dao of martial arts requires being unattached, you must forge ahead."</p><p></p><p>Ye Xiao bowed to the ancestors and then turned to leave.</p><p></p><p>When he came out, Qing Long and Jing Di were sitting in meditation. Sensing his emergence, they immediately stood up.</p><p></p><p>"Ye Xiao, you're out."</p><p></p><p>"How was it? Were there any human race ancestors? Did you see them?"</p><p></p><p>Ye Xiao nodded.</p><p></p><p>"I saw them, but not just one, but a group."</p><p></p><p>"Whew! How powerful, the ancestors were actually a group of them? They must all be Divine Realm experts, right?"</p><p></p><p>Ye Xiao nodded again.</p><p></p><p>"Let's go, the matter here is over, we should go back."</p><p></p><p>"Okay!"</p><p></p><p>The two followed Ye Xiao as they left.</p><p></p><p>The voices gradually faded away.</p><p></p><p>"Ye Xiao, we just divided the medicinal pills into three parts. Each of us can get about two hundred or so, this is your share."</p><p></p><p>Ye Xiao shook his head.</p><p></p><p>"You two keep it."</p><p></p><p>"Are you sure you don't want it? This is an Emperor Pill!"</p><p></p><p>"No, I'm giving it to you."</p><p></p><p>In fact, Ye Xiao no longer needed the Emperor Pill now.</p><p></p><p>He had just obtained the blood qi of the ancestors, and his physical body had already been elevated to another peak level! What he needed now was Divine Pill!</p><p></p><p>Powerful Divine Pill!</p><p></p><p>As long as he could refine a Divine Pill, and then find a hidden place to set up a Spirit-Gathering Formation, Ye Xiao could prepare to break through to the Divine Realm.</p><p></p><p>His physical body was now infinitely close to the Divine Body, and his divine soul was also ready. To put it exaggeratedly, he was now only half a step away from the Divine Realm.</p><p></p><p>He had already stepped into the doorway of the half-step, it was as if the groom was standing at the last line of defense before the wedding, and as long as he took that tiny step forward, he would be able to complete the final ritual of the marriage!</p>

        <h1>Chapter 307</h1>
        <div class="content">
            <p>Here is the full English translation of the Chinese excerpt:</p><p></p><p>Half an hour later, the thunderstorm gradually came to an end, and the people could clearly feel that two powerful auras had emerged.</p><p></p><p>One second, two seconds, three seconds, the thunderclouds in the sky completely disappeared, and one of the clouds burst forth with an extremely strong golden light, like a small sun, with a powerful momentum that made them feel a sense of awe and even had to lower their altitude to accept it.</p><p></p><p>"It's the King Realm! Someone has broken through to the legendary King Realm expert!"</p><p></p><p>"My goodness, who has broken through? To actually break through to the legendary King Realm expert, that's too amazing!"</p><p></p><p>"From now on, our Nine States has gained another King Realm expert, truly a blessing from heaven!"</p><p></p><p>But before the people could finish being shocked, another layer of clouds released an even more powerful light.</p><p></p><p>If the previous light was like a small sun, then this light was a true existence that could rival the sun in the sky!</p><p></p><p>It was many times more powerful than the previous light! What was more terrifying was that at this moment, many people were directly suppressed to their knees on the ground because they could not withstand this power.</p><p></p><p>It was a fear from the depths of their souls, forcing them to submit to that light.</p><p></p><p>The people were dumbfounded, and the vast majority of them did not understand what was happening at this moment.</p><p></p><p>Some of the more powerful cultivators began to tremble.</p><p></p><p>They seemed to have already guessed something.</p><p></p><p>"It's the Emperor Realm! That is an Emperor Realm expert! He has stepped into the realm of the Emperor Realm expert!"</p><p></p><p>"My goodness, the Emperor Realm!"</p><p></p><p>The people were already shocked and did not know what to say.</p><p></p><p>They originally thought that there was a Nine States expert who had broken through to the King Realm, and that was already incredibly powerful.</p><p></p><p>But now, when they saw this Emperor Realm, they suddenly realized that the King Realm was nothing.</p><p></p><p>The Emperor Realm! Not to mention the entire Nine States, even if you put the entire human race together, how many would there be?</p><p></p><p>And now, there was an Emperor Realm expert standing before them.</p><p></p><p>This was not only shocking, but also infinitely glorious.</p><p></p><p>At this moment, even the Venerable Xuanwu, Venerable Zhuque, Venerable Baihu, Li Liushui, Lu Qingshan and other King Realm experts were unable to withstand this oppressive force and had to kneel down.</p><p></p><p>"Is this the power of an Emperor Realm expert? It's actually so terrifying?"</p><p></p><p>"No wonder Qinglong previously wanted to sacrifice himself to help Ye Xiao become an Emperor. For a person to become an Emperor, it is truly too difficult, the hardships they have to endure are beyond our imagination.</p><p></p><p>The difference between the Emperor Realm and the Half-Step Emperor Realm, although only a tiny bit of cultivation level, the power difference is like an unbridgeable chasm! Without Ye Xiao's recent assistance, Qinglong would probably not have been able to break through this step in the short term."</p><p></p><p>At the same time, this also made the crowd even more admiring of Ye Xiao.</p><p></p><p>A young man in his early twenties could surpass these old monsters who had cultivated for hundreds of years, and reach a realm they had never reached before!</p><p></p><p>What an incredibly powerful and extraordinary talent? Qinglong, feeling the powerful force within himself, sighed with emotion. Even though he was already extremely powerful, and his mind had been tempered for a long time, at this moment, he was still immersed in the power of the Emperor Realm expert, unable to extricate himself.</p><p></p><p>At this moment, he could truly be called the Sword Emperor Qinglong!</p><p></p><p>After a while, Qinglong finally collected his mind and aura, descended to the ground, and came before the crowd.</p><p></p><p>Although he had put away his aura, the people could still feel that overwhelming Emperor Realm pressure, unable to help but feel a bit of apprehension.</p><p></p><p>"Big brother Qinglong, congratulations on successfully entering the Emperor Realm."</p><p></p><p>"Brother Qingshan, congratulations on successfully entering the King Realm."</p><p></p><p>Baihu and the others congratulated Qinglong, and only Li Liushui congratulated Lu Qingshan.</p><p></p><p>Qinglong nodded and then spoke:</p><p></p><p>"We two should also go and thank Ye Xiao. After all, it was he who helped us both break through the realms."</p><p></p><p>Lu Qingshan nodded.</p><p></p><p>"Yes, we should go and thank Ye Xiao. I've always wanted to meet him before, but never had the chance.</p><p></p><p>Taking this opportunity, I'll also get to know this extraordinary genius."</p><p></p><p>Jiang Chen smiled.</p><p></p><p>"I'll lead the way."</p><p></p><p>With that, several figures instantly disappeared from the spot, turning into streaks of light, heading towards Ye Xiao's house in Jianghai City.</p><p></p><p>Because their speed was so fast, the distant onlookers did not notice their direction and had not even seen them clearly before they disappeared.</p><p></p><p>This left the crowd greatly disappointed.</p><p></p><p>But the posts online were already heating up.</p><p></p><p>All kinds of speculations were present, almost occupying the top ten rankings of the hot search list.</p><p></p><p>A few minutes later, the group appeared at Ye Xiao's villa.</p><p></p><p>Ye Xiao, who was cultivating spiritual herbs in the courtyard, couldn't help but sigh slightly when he sensed their arrival.</p><p></p><p>More people had come, and soon the entire Nine States would know his identity, which he could hardly keep track of with just one hand.</p><p></p><p>From the initial Northern Palace Strategy to the current Venerable Xuanwu, Sword Saint Li Liushui, Venerable Baihu, and now the three who just arrived - Sword Emperor Qinglong, Fire Knife Zhuque, and Sword Sage Lu Qingshan.</p><p></p><p>Fortunately, they were all top-tier experts in the Nine States.</p><p></p><p>Here is my translation of the Chinese excerpt:</p><p></p><p>Ye Xiao reluctantly accepted it and did not pay too much attention, as he did not need to go around blabbing about his own identity or anything like that.</p><p></p><p>"Ye Xiao, I've brought a few friends over, you don't mind, do you?" </p><p></p><p>The voice of Venerable Xuanwu Zhen Jian Cheng came from outside the door. Ye Xiao was somewhat amused. "You've already brought them here, so how could I mind?" "Liuli, go open the door and invite them in."</p><p></p><p>"Okay." Illusion Liuli opened the door and poked out her little head, causing Lü Qingshan's eyes to sharpen.</p><p></p><p>"A Xiantian Nine-Rank Saint Clan beast?"</p><p></p><p>Li Liushui patted his shoulder. </p><p></p><p>"Don't get so excited, this is Ye Xiao's spirit pet."</p><p></p><p>"Spirit pet."</p><p></p><p>Lü Qingshan's mouth corner couldn't help but twitch violently. </p><p></p><p>It's not surprising that he was shocked, because while there are beast tamers in this world, even the most powerful beast tamers have limited strength. At most, they have spirit pets at the Great Master level, which can already be ranked among the famous beast tamers in the Nine Provinces and even the entire world.</p><p></p><p>However, Ye Xiao summoned a Xiantian Nine-Rank Saint Clan beast, which completely shattered his worldview.</p><p></p><p>But thinking about it carefully, since Ye Xiao's strength and talent are so monstrous, having a Xiantian Nine-Rank Saint Clan beast as a spirit pet seems quite reasonable.</p><p></p><p>Indeed, monstrous people have monstrous things around them.</p><p></p><p>Seeing Lü Qingshan's shock, Jiang Chen smiled slightly.</p><p></p><p>"This has shocked you, huh? You don't know that this kid has set up a beast breeding farm, feeding them the most nourishing things like blood, meat, eggs, milk, and honey every day to nourish their qi and blood. The weakest of those beasts are at least at the Saint Clan level, and the strongest even have spirit beasts at the King Realm level."</p><p></p><p>Sword Emperor Qinglong: "(˙灬˙)!"</p><p>Phoenix Venerable: "(_..)!"</p><p>White Tiger Venerable: ",,,,!"</p><p>Sword Saint Li Liushui: "?(￣△￣?)!"</p><p>Sword Sage Lü Qingshan: "（⊙.⊙）!"</p><p></p><p>Seeing the shock of the crowd, Jiang Chen felt a sense of secret joy. Although he was already quite old, the feeling of seeing others so shocked was truly refreshing.</p><p></p><p>Lü Qingshan couldn't help but ask, "Brother Liushui, you've known Ye Xiao for a long time, how come you didn't know about this?"</p><p></p><p>Li Liushui was silent for a moment.</p><p></p><p>"Don't say anything, let me think."</p><p></p><p>"You can all come in."</p><p></p><p>Illusion Liuli waved her hand, inviting the group to enter Ye Xiao's courtyard. As soon as they entered, they all felt an extremely dense spiritual energy.</p><p></p><p>This spiritual energy came partly from Ye Xiao himself, as he was an Emperor Realm expert, able to absorb spiritual energy at a speed that far exceeded everyone's imagination. At the Emperor Realm, one's cultivation is comparable to a large-scale dragon vein.</p><p></p><p>The other part came from the spiritual gathering formation in Ye Xiao's potted plants, which was the Ditian Guangyuan Formation, an Emperor Realm spiritual gathering formation that could absorb spiritual energy at an astounding speed.</p><p></p><p>"So you are Ye Xiao?" </p><p></p><p>When they first saw Ye Xiao, Qinglong, Zhuque, and Lü Qingshan were all somewhat shocked.</p><p></p><p>Although they had already learned from others that Ye Xiao was just a young man, seeing him in person still couldn't help but shock them.</p><p></p><p>There was no arrogance or naivety typical of young people, only a sense of calmness and composure, as if he was a seasoned veteran.</p><p></p><p>Different from their impression of young people, this "little kid" in their eyes had a maturity that exceeded their expectations.</p><p></p><p>"I am Ye Xiao. Esteemed seniors, your humble abode is honored by your presence. Welcome to my home."</p><p></p><p>The group couldn't help but praise him inwardly again.</p><p></p><p>Although his cultivation was extremely strong, he was neither arrogant nor flustered, unfazed by praise or disgrace. Truly a promising talent, able to cultivate to this level.</p><p></p><p>"By the way, Ye Xiao, what are you holding that shovel for?"</p><p></p><p>"I'm just tidying up my potted plants."</p><p></p><p>"Potted plants?"</p><p></p><p>"Yes, these things."</p><p></p><p>The group looked behind him, once again falling into silence.</p><p></p><p>Potted plants?</p><p></p><p>You call these things potted plants? This is using spatial techniques to forge the pot bottom, shrinking a small mountain-sized area into a small flower pot.</p><p></p><p>And then filling this small flower pot with the most precious heavenly and earthly treasures.</p><p></p><p>If these can be called potted plants, then what should the other potted plants in the world be called? Vegetable pots? </p><p></p><p>No, even vegetable pots don't seem appropriate.</p><p></p><p>Let's call them grass pots!</p>

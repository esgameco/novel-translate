        <h1>Chapter 249</h1>
        <div class="content">
            <p>Here is the full English translation of the Chinese excerpt:</p><p></p><p>"Fuck!" </p><p></p><p>The rhinoceros beetle Iron Ox couldn't help but blurt out a curse.</p><p></p><p>"How long has it been? How could this guy have already broken through to that realm? Is he even human? Even if he's a human with exceptional talent, it's normally impossible for him to break through to that realm so quickly, without decades of cultivation, right?"</p><p></p><p>"Is this guy even human? You're still treating him as a human? You're so naively adorable. I stopped seeing him as human a long time ago."</p><p></p><p>"Oh no, oh no, even if we cultivate for six thousand more years, we might still not be able to escape from his grasp? Realm King experts not only have immense strength, but their lifespans have also risen to a new peak, with thousands of years at their disposal."</p><p></p><p>This statement made the crowd start to feel pessimistic.</p><p></p><p>No wonder he wanted to help them improve their cultivation - they had wondered why he was being so kind, not afraid they would just run away after getting stronger.</p><p></p><p>The reason was clear now.</p><p></p><p>Firstly, his own strength had already increased tremendously, so he had no fear of them escaping.</p><p></p><p>Secondly, with his enhanced strength, their flesh and blood were probably no longer enough to sustain him, so he needed to boost the strength of himself and the other star beasts to have more robust flesh and blood to aid his cultivation.</p><p></p><p>But just then, the Immortal Celestial Elder suddenly spoke up with a sigh:</p><p></p><p>"Haven't you all considered another possibility? </p><p></p><p>If he can boost his own cultivation so quickly, he can surely rapidly improve us star beasts as well.</p><p></p><p>That means, even though he'll be taking our flesh and blood, if our strength increases greatly, our lifespans will also become longer than his.</p><p></p><p>If he dies, we'll still be alive.</p><p></p><p>And by then, our strength may even surpass that of divine beasts!"</p><p></p><p>These words made the eyes of the star beasts suddenly light up, and some even started breathing more heavily.</p><p></p><p>They had been so shocked by Ye Xiao's cultivation speed that they had momentarily forgotten another crucial point.</p><p></p><p>Ye Xiao had said that as long as they offered enough, he could help them break through their current cultivation realms.</p><p></p><p>For them, this was an extremely lucrative method of cultivation improvement.</p><p></p><p>After all, for them, improving their cultivation was as difficult as ascending to the heavens. If they had to rely on themselves, they might only be able to increase their strength by one or two realms in thousands of years, let alone breaking through to the divine beast realm.</p><p></p><p>But with Ye Xiao's cultivation speed and talent, everyone had seen how remarkable he was. </p><p></p><p>So he must have a way to rapidly boost their strength.</p><p></p><p>And they didn't need to worry that Ye Xiao would help them improve their cultivation just for the sake of it, because Ye Xiao needed their stronger flesh and blood to further enhance his own power.</p><p></p><p>This was an unavoidable necessity.</p><p></p><p>Faced with a method that could definitely increase their strength, if all they had to sacrifice was some of their flesh and blood, what was there to worry about?</p><p></p><p>After all, they might never be able to reach the divine beast realm through their own cultivation in their entire lifetimes.</p><p></p><p>Now, all they had to do was cut off their tentacles and hooves every day - it couldn't be simpler!</p><p></p><p>It was practically a free ride to success.</p><p></p><p>In this moment, the star beasts looked at each other, all understanding the gleam in each other's eyes.</p><p></p><p>They had decided - they must continue being this "poultry" for the long haul.</p><p></p><p>"I've decided, I'll be this poultry for at least ten thousand years! Within these ten thousand years, unless he drives me away, I absolutely will not leave," Noel Fist spoke up first.</p><p></p><p>Sameul quickly followed suit.</p><p></p><p>"Well said. Ten thousand years is nothing for us star beasts. </p><p></p><p>It's just the blink of an eye.</p><p></p><p>And in this breeding ground, we don't have to worry about safety at all.</p><p></p><p>As long as our safety is guaranteed, we star beasts can live peacefully here, and with our cultivation improving, our lifespans will be extended even further.</p><p></p><p>Ten thousand years is nothing."</p><p></p><p>"Good! It's just ten thousand years, I, Ji Feng, will see it through to the end!"</p><p> </p><p>Susan quickly raised her hand.</p><p></p><p>"Me too! Me too!"</p><p></p><p>"Count me in as well."</p><p></p><p>"Alright then, it's settled. Within these ten thousand years, we'll all be good poultry, and no one is allowed to run away, lest we incur the displeasure of our master and he stops helping us improve our cultivation."</p><p></p><p>"Right! Whoever dares to run away, the rest of us will band together to kill him."</p><p></p><p>"If any other star beasts come in the future, we should try our best to persuade them not to cause trouble, so as not to upset our master."</p><p></p><p>"Yes, yes, yes, we should form a group and strive to become the strongest poultry in the world."</p><p></p><p>The star beasts looked at each other and burst into hearty laughter.</p><p></p><p>On Ye Xiao's side, he went to the library upstairs and clocked in for work.</p><p></p><p>The hall was already filled with many colleagues, all waiting for the meeting to begin.</p><p></p><p>Ye Xiao noticed that Director Ouyang was no longer standing at the top, but sitting with the others.</p><p></p><p>According to her previous words, after they returned from their cultivation trip, she would no longer be the director.</p><p></p><p>Here is my translation of the Chinese excerpt you provided:</p><p></p><p>After that, the library will have a new director.</p><p></p><p>It seems this matter has already been decided.</p><p></p><p>But it doesn't matter.</p><p></p><p>Whoever becomes the director, as long as they don't interfere with my reading, it's fine.</p><p></p><p>Soon, an elderly man dressed in traditional Chinese attire emerged from the back.</p><p></p><p>He had a square face, was slightly hunched, but neatly dressed, with a nose that looked a bit like a turtle's. His hair and beard were somewhat graying, his gaze calm and composed, with a slight smile on his lips, like a kindly old gentleman.</p><p></p><p>But the moment Ye Xiao saw him, his expression changed slightly.</p><p></p><p>Something's not right.</p><p></p><p>This old fellow is no ordinary person! His cultivation is very strong - to ordinary people, he would appear just like a normal old man, with no special sense of him at all.</p><p></p><p>Just like a truly ordinary elder.</p><p></p><p>Only Ye Xiao could sense that he was different.</p><p></p><p>Of course, he also had some cultivation, probably at the early Xiantian Sixth Rank, but Ye Xiao knew clearly that his cultivation was definitely not just at the early Xiantian Sixth Rank.</p><p></p><p>Beside Ye Xiao, Liu Chengxun spoke with a light smile:</p><p></p><p>"I thought the Jiuzhou Alliance would send some super expert, but it turns out to be just an ordinary old man. </p><p></p><p>His cultivation should be around the peak of the early Xiantian Sixth Rank, a great master.</p><p></p><p>It's a pity, I thought the Jiuzhou Alliance would at least send a Saint Monarch to station here.</p><p></p><p>It seems Jianghai City is not really important to them, so they didn't send a higher-level expert."</p><p></p><p>Ye Xiao did not respond to his words, just calmly watching the old man, his gaze somewhat interested.</p><p></p><p>Even Liu Chengxun couldn't see through the other's cultivation.</p><p></p><p>How interesting.</p><p></p><p>A Monarch Realm expert! Only this level of expert could easily deceive everyone.</p><p></p><p>Even Saint Monarchs would be included.</p><p></p><p>Only he could sense it.</p><p></p><p>Just like only those above the Master Realm would have a different perception of another Master.</p><p></p><p>Monarchs would have a different perception of Monarch Realm experts.</p><p></p><p>But this was not the key point.</p><p></p><p>The key point was that the Jiuzhou Alliance had actually sent a Monarch Realm expert to serve as the director of the Jianghai City library.</p><p></p><p>If he remembered correctly, North Tang Ce had told him before.</p><p></p><p>In the entire Jiuzhou, Monarch Realm experts could be counted on one hand.</p><p></p><p>Apart from the four great guardian sages of the Azure Dragon, White Tiger, Vermilion Bird, and Black Tortoise, there was only one other Monarch Realm expert.</p><p></p><p>They were all ranked among the top few on the World Dragon and Phoenix Rankings.</p><p></p><p>In other words, the other party was one of the five Monarch Realm experts in the Jiuzhou.</p><p></p><p>Who was it? One of the four great guardian sages of the Jiuzhou? Or the other one?</p><p></p><p>The old man seemed to have noticed Ye Xiao's gaze.</p><p></p><p>He glanced in Ye Xiao's direction, but Ye Xiao had already turned his head and started chatting with Liu Chengxun in a casual manner.</p><p></p><p>Moreover, his aura was hidden, far surpassing the other's. </p><p></p><p>Unless he actively revealed it, the other would never be able to see through his cultivation.</p><p></p><p>So, although the old man glanced over, he did not see through Ye Xiao's identity.</p><p></p><p>This was also thanks to Ye Xiao's cultivation having already reached the Monarch Realm.</p><p></p><p>If he had not reached the Monarch Realm, he might have been seen through by the other today.</p><p></p><p>The old man shook his head, somewhat puzzled.</p><p></p><p>"What was that feeling just now? How strange! Why did I feel like I was seen through by someone? Maybe it was just my imagination. The only powerful existence in this library is the early Xiantian Eighth Rank swordsman saint Liu Chengxun, but that little brat Liu Chengxun could absolutely not see through my identity."</p><p></p><p>He murmured to himself, then stepped forward and spoke.</p><p></p><p>"Greetings, everyone. I am Jiang Chen, and from today on, I will be the new director of the Jianghai City Martial Arts Library.</p><p></p><p>Although I am not new to being a director, this is the first time I have been appointed to Jianghai City.</p><p></p><p>In the future, I hope everyone can cooperate more in the work."</p><p></p><p>A bunch of perfunctory official-sounding words, the same old routine, which Ye Xiao could recite without even listening carefully.</p><p></p><p>After briefly speaking, the old man began to announce the new personnel arrangement.</p><p></p><p>As expected, Ye Xiao was promoted.</p><p></p><p>He became the manager of the fourth floor! The manager of the entire floor! This was different from the area manager, as the area manager only managed a large area and had only a few small administrators under them.</p><p></p><p>But now, he had become the manager of the entire floor, and his authority would be much greater.</p><p></p><p>To put it more directly, just from the salary alone, the difference between the two could be seen.</p><p></p><p>An area manager's salary was only a little over 10,000 per month.</p><p></p><p>While the salary of a floor manager started at 60,000.</p><p></p><p>This did not even include some special benefits.</p><p></p><p>For example, he would be assigned a secretary who would handle the work, whether there was work or not.</p><p></p><p>Apart from that, he could go out freely anytime, unlike the area managers who had to stay in their assigned areas every day and could not leave casually.</p><p></p><p>Six updates, 18,000.</p><p></p><p>Recommendations and monthly votes are appreciated.</p><p></p><p>(This chapter is complete)</p>

        <h1>Chapter 178</h1>
        <div class="content">
            <p>Here is the full English translation of the Chinese excerpt:</p><p></p><p>Ye Xiao's gaze flickered slightly.</p><p></p><p>He had been puzzled before - why didn't the Divine Sect go to the Starry Sky Battlefield? </p><p></p><p>If they went to the Starry Sky Battlefield, couldn't they cultivate to higher realms by slaying the Starbeast and refining them into elixirs?</p><p></p><p>But he never expected to get this answer.</p><p></p><p>At first, he had thought of all kinds of reasons, but the one possibility he didn't dare imagine was that the Divine Sect was also wary of the Starry Sky Battlefield.</p><p></p><p>It seems this world is indeed very dangerous, even after one becomes a Divine Sect disciple, one cannot be careless.</p><p></p><p>At this point, Liu Chengxun muttered to himself, "But if one has some real abilities, it's still better to go to the Starry Sky Battlefield. </p><p></p><p>For us, it feels a bit self-enclosed.</p><p></p><p>If we go to the Starry Sky Battlefield, we will definitely grow much faster."</p><p></p><p>Ye Xiao nodded, also considering this matter in his heart, it seems he will have to go to the Starry Sky Battlefield in the future.</p><p></p><p>The two quickly finished their meal and then bid farewell to each other.</p><p></p><p>Liu Chengxun returned to the library dormitory, while Ye Xiao headed in another direction.</p><p></p><p>The Illusory Crystal Cat silently crawled out from the side and jumped onto Ye Xiao's body.</p><p></p><p>"Master, just now the Left Protector of the Beast God Alliance rushed into the sealed area, wanting to use Noel Fis to help him replenish his bloodline power, but now he has been torn to shreds by Noel Fis and the others."</p><p></p><p>"The Beast God Alliance? It seems to be somewhat related to the Beast God Cult."</p><p></p><p>"The Beast God Alliance is the supreme leader of the Beast God Cult, a very large half-beast race alliance within the Nine States.</p><p></p><p>The experts in the Beast God Alliance are countless, like this Left Protector, he is already a Divine Sect cultivator at the Innate Seventh-Grade."</p><p></p><p>"Half-beast race again?"</p><p></p><p>A trace of coldness flashed in Ye Xiao's eyes.</p><p></p><p>Ye Xiao didn't have much good feeling towards the half-beast race, the only one he felt okay with was Ning Yuhen, who was taken away by the Silver Fox Clan.</p><p></p><p>The half-beast race has human bloodline, but they always want to become Starbeasts, thinking Starbeasts are noble, while humans are lowly.</p><p></p><p>Not only do they look down on the human race, they also help the Starbeasts to bully the human race.</p><p></p><p>Wasn't that what Fa Xin did before? To protect the people of Lin City, he cultivated an evil method to seal a half-beast race.</p><p></p><p>So Ye Xiao really disliked most of the half-beast race.</p><p></p><p>"Master, according to Noel Fis and the others, that Left Protector, before his death, had threatened them, saying that he had a coordinate mark on him, and the Alliance Master of the Beast God Alliance will definitely come to avenge him and destroy Jianghai City."</p><p></p><p>Ye Xiao's pupils shrank, the cold intent made the Illusory Crystal Cat shiver violently.</p><p></p><p>The master is angry.</p><p></p><p>It seems those half-beast races are going to have trouble now.</p><p></p><p>"Master, do you want me to go check the location of the Beast God Alliance?"</p><p></p><p>"No need, if their location could be found, the Nine States Alliance would have already destroyed the Beast God Alliance.</p><p></p><p>If it's really as that Left Protector said, it won't be long before the Alliance Master of the Beast God Alliance should come by himself."</p><p></p><p>"Master is wise, then shall we go home and cook now?"</p><p></p><p>The Illusory Crystal Cat is now most excited every day to eat the meat and eggs of the seven-headed Divine Sect Starbeasts, because they contain extremely rich blood qi, making her feel her cultivation is rapidly rising.</p><p></p><p>At this rate, after a month, she will definitely be able to advance to the Innate Sixth-Grade, and then she will only be one step away from becoming a Divine Sect cultivator.</p><p></p><p>But Ye Xiao did not fulfill her wish, shaking his head slightly.</p><p></p><p>"Not today, tomorrow is the weekend, while I'm not working these two days, I'll first go find the cave that Fa Xin went to.</p><p></p><p>You stay in Jianghai City, collect the meat and eggs from Noel Fis and the others on time every day, I'll leave you a smaller spatial ring for you to store these things, and I'll use them when I come back."</p><p></p><p>Although the Illusory Crystal Cat was a bit disappointed, she would still listen to what Ye Xiao said.</p><p></p><p>"Master, don't worry, I'll definitely complete the task."</p><p></p><p>Ye Xiao nodded, then glanced at the map, and with a light step, his figure instantly disappeared from the spot.</p><p></p><p>The currently walking towards the library, Liu Chengxun, suddenly paused.</p><p></p><p>"Just now, was that a big black rat running by?"</p><p></p><p>But he soon shook his head.</p><p></p><p>"I must be confused, how could that be possible?"</p><p></p><p>He himself was a Divine Sect cultivator at the Innate Eighth-Grade, and if someone could run past him without him seeing, that person would not be human.</p><p></p><p>In fact, Ye Xiao's speed was too fast.</p><p></p><p>With the Innate Eighth-Grade plus the Divine Will Technique's speed, it was so fast that no one could see his figure.</p><p></p><p>Even an Innate Ninth-Grade might not be able to easily detect Ye Xiao's speed, let alone Liu Chengxun who was only at the Innate Eighth-Grade.</p><p></p><p>In terms of speed alone, he was not even worthy of holding Ye Xiao's shoes.</p><p></p><p>Ye Xiao quickly arrived at the location marked on the map, not too far from Jianghai City, in the mountains and wilderness of the southeast of the Central State.</p><p></p><p>To the east of the Central State are Jiang State and Qin State. </p><p></p><p>Jiang State is in the north, Qin State in the south, Qin State borders Chu State, while Jiang State is completely adjacent to the Central State.</p><p></p><p>Lin City is located in the northwest of Jiang State and the northeast of the Central State, at the junction of Jiang State and the Central State.</p><p></p><p>This...</p><p></p><p>Here is the full English translation of the Chinese excerpt:</p><p></p><p>In the mountain wilderness, located in the southeast of the Central Plains, it belonged to the Chuzhou Shaolin and was on the main route to the Forest City.</p><p></p><p>After arriving in this mountain wilderness, Ye Xiao immediately released his Taixuan Tiangong and began to explore further.</p><p></p><p>The Taixuan Tiangong spread out in the air, quickly occupying the entire mountain forest, and scanning at a frequency of hundreds of times per second.</p><p></p><p>In just a few breaths, Ye Xiao had determined the location.</p><p></p><p>"Found it." Ye Xiao's mind stirred, and he immediately deployed the Shenyi Jue, instantly appearing inside a mountain cave.</p><p></p><p>At the entrance of the cave, there were a few bones piled up, indicating that a fierce beast or a star beast had taken up residence inside.</p><p></p><p>But Ye Xiao didn't care at all, his Taixuan Tiangong had already scanned and marked everything.</p><p></p><p>As Ye Xiao entered, a low growl came from the darkness, and then a super-level blue wolf charged towards him, opening its bloody maw in the darkness, the stench of blood assaulting his nostrils. The bloody maw was large enough to swallow three of Ye Xiao's heads.</p><p></p><p>Thud.</p><p></p><p>The blue wolf fell heavily to the ground, with a large hole in its head, its breath completely gone.</p><p></p><p>Ye Xiao didn't even raise his hand, the Taixuan Tiangong controlled by his spiritual power condensed into substance and instantly pierced through the blue wolf's head, ruthlessly killing it.</p><p></p><p>Arriving at the depths, Ye Xiao found that the cave had been transformed into the blue wolf's den.</p><p></p><p>However, the techniques were carved on the walls, so they were not damaged.</p><p></p><p>Ye Xiao glanced around, and the first thing he saw was the Rulai Shenzhang.</p><p></p><p>He was already familiar with the Rulai Shenzhang, as he had cultivated it himself.</p><p></p><p>Subsequently, Ye Xiao's gaze fell upon the other techniques.</p><p></p><p>The Nianhua Zhi, Mohe Zhi, Dali Jingang Zhi, and Yiyang Zhi were quickly collected by the Golden Book.</p><p></p><p>Four finger techniques, it seemed that the predecessor who had carved the finger techniques on the wall had a deep understanding of finger techniques.</p><p></p><p>In this way, Ye Xiao's finger techniques were instantly approaching their peak, adding up to a total of eleven.</p><p></p><p>However, whether they could be combined would depend on the cultivation of the Golden Book's divine soul to the Great Perfection realm.</p><p></p><p>Then, Ye Xiao finally turned his gaze to the last technique.</p><p></p><p>"The Dharma Sutra! It's actually the Shaolin Damo Jing, the supreme heart cultivation technique!"</p><p></p><p>After clearly seeing the heart cultivation technique on the wall, Ye Xiao's face immediately lit up with joy.</p><p></p><p>The Dharma Sutra was a supreme heart cultivation technique, and Facheng had previously told him that it was a closely guarded secret of Shaolin.</p><p></p><p>He had been wondering how he could obtain the Dharma Sutra in the future, but unexpectedly, he had found it in this cave.</p><p></p><p>Now he wouldn't have to go to Shaolin and go through a lot of trouble.</p><p></p><p>In addition to the four Shaolin finger technique specialties, he had gained a lot this time.</p><p></p><p>It seemed that deciphering this map was the right decision.</p><p></p><p>Perfect!</p><p></p><p>Ye Xiao immediately absorbed the Dharma Sutra into his body and began to cultivate it, driving the divine soul of the Golden Book.</p><p></p><p>Probably in a couple of hours, the four finger techniques would be fully cultivated.</p><p></p><p>As for the heart cultivation technique, it would likely have to wait until tomorrow morning.</p><p></p><p>With the Ziwei Xinghai and the Dharma Sutra, he would have two supreme heart cultivation techniques.</p><p></p><p>But Ye Xiao didn't feel it was too much.</p><p></p><p>Since heart cultivation techniques could be combined, the more techniques the better.</p><p></p><p>Now he just had to wait for his cultivation to reach the level where he could combine the techniques, and then he would go and combine the heart cultivation techniques.</p><p></p><p>At that time, three heart cultivation techniques combined into one, the number of techniques would be greatly reduced.</p><p></p><p>It's just not known whether all the techniques will eventually be fused into one technique.</p><p></p><p>Now that he had learned all this, it was time to return to Jianghai City.</p><p></p><p>However, at this moment, Ye Xiao sensed a murderous aura.</p><p></p><p>His brow furrowed, the Taixuan Tiangong swept through, and he received some sound feedback.</p><p></p><p>"Help! Don't kill me."</p><p>"Mom, mom, wake up... Wuwuwu."</p><p>"You soulless half-beasts, the heavens will not forgive you!"</p><p>"Half-beasts again?"</p><p></p><p>Ye Xiao's gaze turned cold.</p><p></p><p>He now had an extreme dislike for the group of half-beasts.</p><p></p><p>Especially when they were killing human tribes.</p><p></p><p>With a thought, the Shenyi Jue was activated, and Ye Xiao instantly appeared in a small village more than a hundred miles away.</p><p></p><p>The location of the village was relatively hidden, but there were many villagers living there.</p><p></p><p>At this moment, the power lines in the village had been severed.</p><p></p><p>The entire village was in complete darkness.</p><p></p><p>Only cries for help were constantly coming out, and they were gradually weakening.</p><p></p><p>This meant that the people in the village were about to die out.</p><p></p><p>How ruthless and vicious! This village must have had several hundred households, and the half-beasts were so cruel and vicious.</p><p></p><p>Ye Xiao snorted coldly, and golden sword beams appeared behind him, radiating hundreds of rays of light that penetrated into the village. The next moment, a series of explosion sounds continuously came from the village.</p>

        <h1>Chapter 285</h1>
        <div class="content">
            <p>Here is the full English translation of the Chinese excerpt:</p><p></p><p>Huan Liuli turned and ran into the courtyard. Youwei couldn't help but ask in puzzlement, "Strange, why did Lady Ye say 'this servant'? Isn't that how eunuchs from the human race refer to themselves?"</p><p></p><p>The next moment, a series of agonized cries suddenly came from the courtyard.</p><p></p><p>"Ah~!"</p><p>"Ouch~!"</p><p>"Gently."</p><p></p><p>Youwei's pretty face flushed red.</p><p></p><p>Senior Ye, you're really going at it, and in broad daylight too.</p><p></p><p>A moment later, Ye Xiao walked out of the courtyard. Seeing Ye Xiao, Youwei's legs trembled slightly, but she still bowed respectfully and said, "Junior Youwei of the Silver Fox Clan pays respects to Senior Ye."</p><p></p><p>Ye Xiao spoke indifferently, "What are you here for?"</p><p></p><p>Youwei hurriedly replied, "Junior has been entrusted by our Silver Fox Clan's Holy Son to come and deliver a message to Senior Ye."</p><p></p><p>"Holy Son?"</p><p></p><p>"That would be Ning Yuheng."</p><p></p><p>Youwei quickly added, and Ye Xiao was somewhat surprised.</p><p></p><p>"Oh? Has he already become your clan's Holy Son?"</p><p></p><p>Youwei explained with a smile, "Yes! The Holy Son has exceptional talents and extraordinary abilities! He has also inherited the legacy of our Silver Fox Clan's elders, gaining profound enlightenment, and has now become a Saint-Emperor Realm cultivator at the Innate Eighth Rank!"</p><p></p><p>"So fast!" </p><p></p><p>Ye Xiao was somewhat surprised. After all, before Ning Yuheng left, his cultivation was only at the Mortal Realm, not even reaching the Innate Realm.</p><p></p><p>But in such a short time, he had actually broken through to the Innate Eighth Rank. </p><p></p><p>However, since he had received the profound enlightenment from the Silver Fox Clan's elders, having such cultivation was quite normal. Those old monsters had probably cultivated for hundreds or thousands of years, and they directly transmitted all their cultivation to him, which was equivalent to gifting him hundreds or thousands of years' worth of cultivation.</p><p></p><p>It was not something he had truly cultivated himself.</p><p></p><p>"What did he send you here to find me for?"</p><p></p><p>"To reply to Senior Ye, our Silver Fox Clan has discovered a legacy site of the Human Emperor Realm, and it is very likely to open up soon. So the Holy Son wishes to invite you to come, as there may be an opportunity for you."</p><p></p><p>Ye Xiao's eyes flickered.</p><p></p><p>"A legacy of the Human Emperor Realm?"</p><p></p><p>How could a legacy of the Human Emperor Realm be in the Silver Fox Clan? However, since Youwei was in front of him, there was no possibility of her lying. Even if he just casually scanned her with the Taixuan Tiangong, he would clearly know her thoughts.</p><p></p><p>If that was the case, then he needed to consider it carefully. After all, what he was currently lacking was the enlightenment regarding the Emperor Realm.</p><p></p><p>As long as he could obtain even a sliver of that enlightenment, he could instantly break through to success.</p><p></p><p>So this sliver of enlightenment was of utmost importance to him.</p><p></p><p>"The Silver Fox Clan, huh?"</p><p></p><p>Ye Xiao looked up towards the sky, it seems he would have to go there.</p><p></p><p>"But before that, there is one more thing I need to take care of. You wait here, I'll be back shortly."</p><p></p><p>"Yes!"</p><p></p><p>Youwei responded, and Ye Xiao disappeared from the spot, his sudden speed startling Youwei.</p><p></p><p>"Senior Ye's strength seems to have grown even stronger than before."</p><p></p><p>Just as she finished speaking, the door creaked open, and Huan Liuli walked out, limping and swaying her hips.</p><p></p><p>"Lady Ye, are you alright?"</p><p></p><p>"I'm fine, this servant is going out to buy some medicine, you wait here."</p><p></p><p>"Yes!"</p><p></p><p>Watching Huan Liuli limp away, a blush once again rose to Youwei's face.</p><p></p><p>Senior Ye's greatness seems to be manifested not only in his cultivation.</p><p></p><p>On Ye Xiao's side, he wanted to find Jiang Chen and inquire about whether the Sage Emperor and Cloud Emperor from the Star Battlefield had time to meet him. If he could not gain any enlightenment from the Emperor Realm legacy, he could try to obtain it from the two Emperors.</p><p></p><p>However, when he arrived at Jiang Chen's office, he did not see the other party. This made him slightly puzzled.</p><p></p><p>With a thought, Ye Xiao expanded his perception, and his expression changed slightly.</p><p></p><p>"This is... eleven Monarch Realm experts? Could it be that they want to reclaim the Dragon Vein?"</p><p></p><p>Ye Xiao's expression darkened, and he was about to hurry over.</p><p></p><p>However, the next moment, he also sensed another figure heading towards the Western Sea, and after a brief moment of surprise, he shook his head.</p><p></p><p>It seems he no longer needs to go over there.</p><p></p><p>Shortly after, Deputy Director Ouyang Yunzhong walked in, and seeing Ye Xiao, his eyes lit up.</p><p></p><p>"Young Master Ye has come."</p><p></p><p>Ye Xiao: "(...)"</p><p></p><p>Why has the Director suddenly become so enthusiastic? And he even called him "Young Master Ye"? "Director, what's going on?"</p><p></p><p>Ouyang Yunzhong smiled and said, "Young Master Ye, you don't have to hide it, I understand. In front of others, I'll still call you by your name. But in private, I'll address you as Young Master Ye."</p><p></p><p>"Director, there's no need to be so polite."</p><p></p><p>"Oh yes, I have a confidential document here for Director Jiang. Before he left, he entrusted me to tell you about it if there was anything. So I'll give this confidential document to you."</p><p></p><p>Ye Xiao nodded and took it, his divine sense scanning it. The content was a response from the Nine State Alliance.</p><p></p><p>It was a brief message: "The battle situation is dire, the two Emperors cannot withdraw, please postpone the matter for now."</p><p></p><p>It seems he cannot go to the Star Battlefield for the time being. In that case, this is a good opportunity to go to the Silver Fox Clan.</p><p></p><p>Here is the full English translation of the Chinese excerpt:</p><p></p><p>The Silver Fox Clan, let's take a look at the inheritance of the Human Realm's Imperial Realm.</p><p></p><p>At this moment, Ouyang Yunzhong smiled and said:</p><p></p><p>"Young Master Ye, the girlfriend I introduced to you last time was not reliable, and I have always felt guilty about it. So I've been thinking about this matter, and I want to introduce another girlfriend to you. Do you have any requirements?"</p><p></p><p>"No need, I'm not ready to consider this issue right now."</p><p></p><p>Ye Xiao directly and decisively refused.</p><p></p><p>A man should prioritize cultivation, and he hasn't even reached the Divine Realm, so what qualifications does he have to fall in love? However, Ye Xiao has indeed thought about this issue.</p><p></p><p>In the future, when he finds a girlfriend, no matter what, he must not find a girlfriend who cultivates Body Refinement Techniques.</p><p></p><p>He has already cultivated the Body Refinement Technique, and if he finds another Body Refinement Technique cultivator, that would be just ridiculous.</p><p></p><p>Originally, it should be 'pa~pa~pa', but it would become 'Duang~Duang~Duang~', which he definitely cannot accept.</p><p></p><p>"If Manager Jiang returns, just tell him I have some matters and need to go out for a while."</p><p></p><p>"Okay, I will definitely convey this for you."</p><p></p><p>Ye Xiao nodded, then used the Yin-Yang Escape Technique to leave and return to find Youwei, heading to the Silver Fox Clan to explore that Imperial Realm inheritance.</p><p></p><p>At this time, above the Western Sea, several figures gathered, all with solemn expressions and tense spirits, not daring to relax even a bit.</p><p></p><p>All of them were staring intently at the sea in front of them, and even a few Grand Ancestors had beads of cold sweat on their foreheads.</p><p></p><p>On the sea surface, there were eleven extremely powerful auras.</p><p></p><p>Each aura was earth-shaking in magnitude, so powerful that they instilled fear, making them feel like insignificant ants.</p><p></p><p>These were the powers of eleven Monarch Realm experts!</p><p></p><p>They were among the top eight on the World Dragon Ranking and Phoenix Ranking.</p><p></p><p>Any one of them could easily stir up a storm of shock and awe anywhere in the world.</p><p></p><p>And now, these eleven had gathered here.</p><p></p><p>Due to the overwhelming magnitude of their auras, the waves on the sea surface were suppressed to a minimal extent, and the sea breeze seemed to have solidified, making the sea even more scorching.</p><p></p><p>These Divine Ancestors and Grand Ancestors did not dare to move a muscle, nor did they dare to speak lightly. If the other side had a single thought, they could all be crushed to death here.</p><p></p><p>This kind of overwhelming oppressive force was unprecedented.</p><p></p><p>However, at this moment, two figures silently emerged, like shooting stars, and flew directly towards the eleven Monarch Realm auras on the sea.</p><p></p><p>The crowd suddenly felt a sense of joy, as if they had all been granted salvation, and they let out a sigh of relief.</p><p></p><p>One Grand Ancestor even directly collapsed onto the reef beneath his feet, his entire body drenched in sweat. The pressure he had just endured was something he had never experienced in his life, as if facing a calamity of annihilation.</p><p></p><p>"Great, the Venerable One has arrived. With the Venerable One here, we don't need to worry too much."</p><p></p><p>On the sea, the eleven Monarch Realm experts of various appearances and skin tones finally showed some change in their calm expressions after sensing this extremely powerful force.</p><p></p><p>"Venerable Xuanwu, you've finally come!"</p><p></p><p>A white-skinned, golden-haired, gentleman-dressed Monarch Realm expert stared intently at Venerable Xuanwu Jian Chen and the Sword Deity Li Liushui beside him.</p><p></p><p>Jian Chen smiled faintly.</p><p></p><p>"What kind of wind is blowing today that has brought all the top-ranked Monarchs in the world to this place? How rare!"</p><p></p><p>"Venerable Xuanwu, don't beat around the bush with us. You know why we are here. Hand over the Dragon Veins."</p><p></p><p>"Dragon Veins? What Dragon Veins? I don't know anything about that."</p><p></p><p>"Venerable Xuanwu, are you trying to provoke a battle between the Monarchs? Those two have been wreaking havoc in the West, stealing seventeen Dragon Veins from the Star Beasts, and have now entered your Nine Heavenly Realms.</p><p></p><p>And now you're still trying to evade us?"</p><p></p><p>"You'd better hand over the Dragon Veins yourself, or else don't blame us eleven Monarchs for taking them back by force.</p><p></p><p>When the blood flows, it won't be something you can bear!"</p><p></p><p>Facing this threat, Jian Chen directly released his powerful aura.</p><p></p><p>"Such a big mouth! I came here to give you face, do you really think you're that impressive?"</p><p></p><p>Boom! Facing eleven opponents, Jian Chen was not the least bit inferior! Sword Deity Li Liushui was shocked, this was the power of the Venerable Xuanwu, the guardian of the Nine Heavenly Realms?</p><p></p><p>This fighting spirit was completely on par with the Shocking Tiger he had encountered before in the Jianghai City.</p><p></p><p>Even as a Monarch Realm expert, Li Liushui could feel that he was just a speck of dust in front of Jian Chen.</p><p></p><p>No wonder Venerable Xuanwu didn't let him come earlier, this battle was indeed not something he could easily participate in.</p><p></p><p>However, as a man of the Nine Heavenly Realms, even if his strength was not enough, he could not retreat. This was the bottom line of a Nine Heavenly Realms man!</p>

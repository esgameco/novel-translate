        <h1>Chapter 116</h1>
        <div class="content">
            <p>Here is the full English translation of the Chinese excerpt:</p><p></p><p>Dou Tian Yu revealed an envious expression.</p><p></p><p>To be able to serve that senior figure, what a great fortune it was!</p><p></p><p>Last time, because of that playboy from the Zhao family, the other party only gave him a warning, and didn't even show up.</p><p></p><p>But his uncle not only met the other party, but also received instructions from them.</p><p></p><p>It was a tremendous honor! He really hoped that one day, he too could serve that extraordinary superior!</p><p></p><p>After Ye Xiao came down, he quickly found Wang Dalonglong.</p><p></p><p>This guy sold him a whole small truck's worth of obsidian.</p><p></p><p>It was also lucky that obsidian was cheap, as the entire truckload only cost him around a hundred thousand.</p><p></p><p>The spatial force contained within the obsidian was quite weak, so he needed to purchase a lot more.</p><p></p><p>After the transaction was completed, Ye Xiao rented a small truck, loaded up all of Wang Dalonglong's obsidian, and sent it back to his own home.</p><p></p><p>He had accumulated enough obsidian, but to make a spatial ring, he still needed other materials and carriers.</p><p></p><p>Because although obsidian is hard, it is also quite brittle, a bit like jade.</p><p></p><p>It cannot withstand very high temperatures, and if it encounters certain special alloy structures or attacks, it is also easily shattered.</p><p></p><p>Most importantly, the obsidian can only withstand a certain amount of spatial force based on its own size - any more and it won't be able to bear it.</p><p></p><p>Ye Xiao planned to add some other materials.</p><p></p><p>For example, he could use black sand gold to alleviate the brittleness of the obsidian, allowing it to be a bit more pliable and not easily shattered in battle.</p><p></p><p>This concept is similar to putting a screen protector on a phone - even if it shatters, the glass shards won't fly everywhere.</p><p></p><p>He also needed to add iron essence, which can self-repair cracks.</p><p></p><p>Additionally, it would be best to add a layer of sticky yellow mud, as the special property of yellow mud is that it can stabilize the form, ensuring that even if the obsidian is attacked, its internal structure won't easily shake.</p><p></p><p>Combining these three elements would allow him to refine a decent spatial ring.</p><p></p><p>Ye Xiao poured the truckload of obsidian onto the courtyard, as this material wasn't very valuable and didn't need special guarding.</p><p></p><p>Then he still needed to return the rental truck.</p><p></p><p>Even without starting the refinement yet, Ye Xiao was already looking forward to the convenience of a storage ring.</p><p></p><p>If he had a storage ring, he could carry however many things he wanted, wherever he wanted, and his mother wouldn't have to worry about his travels anymore.</p><p></p><p>After taking care of all this, Ye Xiao quickly went to Old Xu's materials store.</p><p></p><p>Old Xu wasn't there, and the one minding the shop was Xu Daomao, munching on sunflower seeds and watching a live broadcast on the computer screen.</p><p></p><p>"Where's the store owner?"</p><p></p><p>Ye Xiao asked, and she spat out the seed shells, casually pointing to the screen.</p><p></p><p>"My dad went to an auction, he won't be back for a while. Look, he's still on the screen there."</p><p></p><p>"What's he doing going to an auction?"</p><p></p><p>"Didn't you know? This auction has been heavily advertised lately, it's the East Wind Weapons event, held annually in various places across the Nine Provinces.</p><p></p><p>They auction off some really nice things that are normally hard to come by."</p><p></p><p>Ye Xiao thought about it, seemed like he had heard of this before, something similar to the Singles' Day sales in his previous life, except this auction wouldn't have any discounts, just rare high-end items that cultivators normally couldn't buy.</p><p></p><p>For many cultivators, this was a good opportunity to try and acquire a coveted high-end weapon, or other superior treasures.</p><p></p><p>Here is the full English translation of the Chinese excerpt:</p><p></p><p>"Since Boss Xu is not here, can you help me get some materials?" </p><p></p><p>"Hold on, there's a big event happening now, let me finish watching this first."</p><p></p><p>Ye Xiao nodded and sat on the sofa in the shop, fiddling with his phone.</p><p></p><p>The public account had pushed a news update about the latest events in Jianghai City, including a link to a live auction.</p><p></p><p>Since he had nothing better to do, Ye Xiao clicked on it out of boredom and entered the live broadcast channel.</p><p></p><p>The item currently being auctioned was a ring.</p><p></p><p>"This is..." </p><p></p><p>Ye Xiao was somewhat taken aback, as it turned out to be a spatial ring. No wonder Boss Xu said there was a big event coming up.</p><p></p><p>After a brief explanation from the auctioneer, Ye Xiao gained some understanding of this spatial ring.</p><p></p><p>It had a storage capacity of about one cubic meter, and in addition to being able to temporarily store living beings, it was also engraved with a star formation that provided defensive and preservation functions.</p><p></p><p>Any fresh items placed inside would not rot.</p><p></p><p>This gave Ye Xiao some food for thought. Previously, he felt that star formations didn't provide much immediate benefit to him, so he didn't pay much attention to them.</p><p></p><p>But now it seems he should take the time to learn more. While star formations may not significantly boost his actual combat power, they can be very useful for daily assistance, and in rare cases, even provide some combat support.</p><p></p><p>For example, the defensive function. When worn on his hand, the ring would certainly not be lost, but what if he did lose it? Wouldn't others be able to easily open it? With a star formation, it could prevent others from forcibly breaking into the storage ring. And if the opponent's strength was enough to break the ring, the ring could even trigger an explosive formation to blow them to pieces!</p><p></p><p>And the preservation function. Previously, when he dug a cellar to store black-scaled snake meat, he had to purchase some simple ice formations to keep it fresh. In the future, if he collected the corpses of star beasts and stored them in the spatial ring, without a preservation formation, what if they rotted?</p><p></p><p>Like Aer King's antelope, with all that delicious, tender meat, it would be such a waste if it spoiled!</p><p></p><p>By this time, the auctioneer had finished his explanation. He concluded passionately, "This is an exquisite storage ring! The starting bid is not 100 million, not 50 million, but only 10 million! Each bid must be at least 1 million higher. This is so cheap, if you miss it, you'll regret it for the rest of your life! If you're interested, act now! The auction begins!"</p><p></p><p>"10 million, 1 million more!"</p><p>"15 million!"</p><p>"20 million!"</p><p></p><p>As soon as the auctioneer finished speaking, the crowd immediately went into a frenzy of bidding.</p><p></p><p>In the blink of an eye, the price of the storage ring had soared past 80 million, and the trend showed it would easily surpass 100 million.</p><p></p><p>Ye Xiao: "(_..)!"</p><p></p><p>"It's just a one-cubic-meter storage ring. Its actual function shouldn't be much different from a grandmaster-level weapon, right? Are these people crazy? Why are they driving the price up so high?"</p><p></p><p>He had not read any books about storage rings, as such literature was quite scarce, so he completely failed to understand what these people were doing.</p>

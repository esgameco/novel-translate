        <h1>Chapter 279</h1>
        <div class="content">
            <p>Here is the full English translation of the Chinese excerpt:</p><p></p><p>The next day, Ye Xiao went to work as usual. The city had already been repaired by Li Liushui, and the methods and speed of the King Realm experts were undoubtedly impressive - it was done so quickly.</p><p></p><p>In the morning, while Ye Xiao was reading, Liu Chengxun came over, somewhat surprised:</p><p></p><p>"Ye Xiao, when did you come back?"</p><p></p><p>"Last night, what's wrong?"</p><p></p><p>"It's good that you came back late yesterday. You don't know, the Sword Immortal Li Liushui has fallen into demonic cultivation. The battle yesterday was truly shocking.</p><p></p><p>If you had come back earlier, you might have had to evacuate with us as well."</p><p></p><p>Ye Xiao nodded.</p><p></p><p>"I guess I was quite lucky."</p><p></p><p>"Speaking of which, it seems like you're always quite lucky. Whenever the Sword Immortals appear and there's danger around, you always manage to easily avoid it.</p><p></p><p>Last time when the Beast God Alliance attacked Jianghai City, and there was trouble in the Central Plains, you were unharmed as well.</p><p></p><p>Your luck stat is really maxed out, huh.</p><p></p><p>It's just a pity that you never get to see the Sword Immortals."</p><p></p><p>Ye Xiao shrugged.</p><p></p><p>"As a small fry like me, I have to run away when there's trouble, and avoid getting involved, in order to live longer. Not seeing the Sword Immortals is a blessing for me."</p><p></p><p>Liu Chengxun nodded, fully agreeing.</p><p></p><p>"That's right, as long as you're safe, that's the main thing."</p><p></p><p>He said this and then went to the side to sit in meditation.</p><p></p><p>Ye Xiao noticed that the fluctuations of spiritual energy in Liu Chengxun's body had also increased a bit, likely because he had seen his own divine light and gained some insights, and was now trying to break through.</p><p></p><p>It seems that this time, because of his own breakthrough, many people had benefited.</p><p></p><p>For the entire Nine Heavenly Realms, it was a great opportunity.</p><p></p><p>In fact, this was something that should have been fully activated when he reached the Divine Realm, by completely awakening the divine blood within him. </p><p></p><p>But now, with the help of the White Dragon Vein, he had completely activated the divine blood in his Monarch Realm state, advancing this step ahead of time.</p><p></p><p>However, this was also a good thing - the strength of all the cultivators in the Nine Heavenly Realms had been enhanced, and when facing the upcoming Demonic Beast Disaster, they would naturally be able to handle it more easily.</p><p></p><p>Ye Xiao read a few more books, then went to the librarian's office.</p><p></p><p>Jiang Chen was cleaning his fish tank, and Ye Xiao wondered if it was because he was a Xuanwu Venerable that he especially liked raising turtles! His office was full of turtles, some of which were probably older than him.</p><p></p><p>"Ye Xiao is here, come, come, have a seat."</p><p></p><p>Seeing Ye Xiao arrive, Jiang Chen seemed very happy. He quickly put down the fish tank he was cleaning, wiped his hands, and walked over to Ye Xiao.</p><p></p><p>"The spirit stones I had someone bring over have arrived. You said yesterday that you wanted to set up an Emperor Formation for this city, can we start working on that today?"</p><p></p><p>Ye Xiao replied calmly:</p><p></p><p>"Last night, I've already set it up. A total of 118 formations, fully covering the entire Jianghai City, with a depth of 100 meters, without affecting the city's planning and development."</p><p></p><p>Jiang Chen: "⊙⊙!"</p><p></p><p>He couldn't quite believe his ears.</p><p></p><p>"You set up all of those formations, and they're all Emperor Formations?"</p><p></p><p>Ye Xiao nodded.</p><p></p><p>"You did this all in one night?"</p><p></p><p>Ye Xiao nodded again.</p><p></p><p>After fully confirming this, Jiang Chen fell into a moment of silence.</p><p></p><p>118 formations, and they were all Emperor Formations.</p><p></p><p>What a massive project was this? If the top formation masters from the Imperial Capital Martial Arts University were to do it, even without sleeping, it would still take them three to five years, right? But Ye Xiao had completed it all in one night?</p><p></p><p>This speed was simply divine speed among divine speeds.</p><p></p><p>If those formation masters heard about this, they might just go hang themselves out of sheer shock.</p><p></p><p>Ye Xiao handed the formation diagrams to Jiang Chen.</p><p></p><p>He was already used to this kind of astonishment from them.</p><p></p><p>In fact, this was the very reason he had never revealed his true identity in front of others.</p><p></p><p>Many things that he could do effortlessly were earth-shattering events for them.</p><p></p><p>It was always like this, and it really wasn't easy to get along with them.</p><p></p><p>After handing over the formation diagrams, Ye Xiao began to talk about the Star Battlefield.</p><p></p><p>"Venerable Xuanwu, I've come this time with another matter to ask about. That is regarding the Star Battlefield.</p><p></p><p>I know that there should be Emperor Realm experts in the Star Battlefield. Can you let me go there to see them? I want to learn more about the Emperor Realm through them, and try to break through to that final level."</p><p></p><p>The Xuanwu Venerable nodded.</p><p></p><p>"You should go take a look. Your current strength is just one step away from reaching the Emperor Realm, and if you can break through to that realm sooner, it will be a great boon for the entire Nine Heavenly Realms."</p><p></p><p>Pausing for a moment, he continued:</p><p></p><p>"However, the Star Battlefield and the earthly realm are two separate systems. </p><p></p><p>We don't have direct communication, so I'll need to report this to the Star Battlefield first, to see if they'll allow you to go over."</p><p></p><p>"Then can you first tell me about the situation in the Star Battlefield? For example, the personnel deployment?"</p><p></p><p>"Alright."</p><p></p><p>The Xuanwu Venerable responded.</p><p></p><p>"The Star Battlefield is currently defended by all the human tribes of the world, with the Nine Heavenly Realms occupying about one-fifth, and the other realms jointly occupying the remaining four-fifths."</p><p></p><p>Here is the full English translation of the Chinese excerpt:</p><p></p><p>"Currently, there are two Empyrean Realm experts in the Nine Provinces - Emperor Jing and Emperor Yun!</p><p></p><p>Emperor Jing entered the Empyrean Realm 572 years ago.</p><p></p><p>Emperor Yun entered the Empyrean Realm 325 years ago. </p><p></p><p>After them, no one else in the Nine Provinces has reached the Empyrean Realm.</p><p></p><p>And the Empyrean Realm experts before them have all sacrificed themselves in the defense of humanity.</p><p></p><p>Currently, there are sixteen King Realm experts.</p><p></p><p>There are also a few Empyrean Realm experts in the West - Thunder Emperor of the Western Territories, Wolf Emperor of the American Territories, Bright God Emperor of the Western Alliance, and Gold Demon Great Emperor of the Southern Alliance.</p><p></p><p>The remaining King Realm experts are roughly in the tens.</p><p></p><p>As for the information on the Star Beasts, I'm not very clear about that. But one thing I know is that the Star Beasts must be stronger than humanity.</p><p></p><p>Otherwise, the Star Battlefield wouldn't be so precarious."</p><p></p><p>Ye Xiao's eyes flickered.</p><p></p><p>He didn't expect the Star Battlefield to have so many powerful forces, yet they were still being pressed hard by the Star Beasts.</p><p></p><p>Like in Jianghai City and the nearby small cities, every year many cultivators graduate, and as long as their strength reaches the Sixth Stage of the Mortal Realm or above, they are all sent in large numbers to the Star Battlefield.</p><p></p><p>These cultivators sent to the Star Battlefield will grow into Innate Realm experts, even beyond the Patriarch Realm, in the following years or even decades.</p><p></p><p>Humanity's strength is not weak, and the reinforcements they send each year are not small either.</p><p></p><p>It seems that the Star Beasts are truly not to be underestimated.</p><p></p><p>However, upon further reflection, the senior of the Changbai Dragon Vein had also said that this world is far more than what meets the eye, and this is just a small world.</p><p></p><p>Above them, there are the God Clan!</p><p></p><p>This is just the beginning. If they can't even get past the Star Beasts, there's no need to talk about further advancement.</p><p></p><p>Thinking about this, he turned to Jiang Chen and said:</p><p></p><p>"I understand, then please help me contact them."</p><p></p><p>Ye Xiao must find the opportunity to become an Empyrean Realm expert as soon as possible.</p><p></p><p>"Okay! I will immediately report this matter to the Nine Provinces Alliance, so that they can report it up the chain of command as soon as possible."</p><p></p><p>The words had just fallen when, suddenly, a thunderous sound came from the distant sky, immediately drawing the attention of the two.</p><p></p><p>Their gaze, through the huge floor-to-ceiling window, looked towards the west.</p><p></p><p>Only to see a huge and oppressive black cloud rapidly approaching them.</p><p></p><p>It looked like a cloud, but the aura of murderous intent emanating from it made Jiang Chen's face turn grim.</p><p></p><p>"Such a powerful aura. This is at least above the King Realm, which expert is coming?"</p><p></p><p>Ye Xiao's mouth curved slightly upwards.</p><p></p><p>"He's finally here, I knew he would come."</p><p></p><p>Xuanwu Venerable was startled.</p><p></p><p>"Who's coming?"</p><p></p><p>"Just the food delivery guy." </p><p></p><p>Ye Xiao smiled faintly and walked out.</p><p></p><p>"I'll go take care of something, no need to sound the city-wide alarm."</p><p></p><p>Xuanwu Venerable was even more puzzled.</p><p></p><p>"This kid, what the hell is he up to? I can't understand a single word he says."</p><p></p><p>But since Ye Xiao said it's nothing, it shouldn't be a big deal, right?</p><p></p><p>"A food delivery guy? Could it be that the other party is Ye Xiao's friend? It's also possible, after all, for such a powerful and extraordinary existence like him, having one or two King Realm experts as friends is quite normal."</p><p></p><p>Thinking about this, Xuanwu Venerable shook his head and went back to tending his fish tank.</p><p></p><p>Meanwhile, in the basement of the library, the Star Beasts like Qingniu, Fenglong, and Saimuel who were playing cards suddenly had their hearts tremble, and they looked at each other with shocked expressions.</p><p></p><p>"This aura, it's the Tiger God! The Tiger God has come!"</p><p></p><p>"It really is the Tiger God! He has truly come!"</p><p></p><p>"But something's not right, the time for the Holy War hasn't arrived yet, how could he be coming now? Unless..."</p><p></p><p>Fenglong fell silent: "The Tiger God is the most righteous, if my guess is correct, he must have rushed here ahead of the Holy War through the temporal passage to rescue us."</p><p></p><p>"Tiger God!"</p><p></p><p>The Star Beasts under the Tiger God's command couldn't help but have their eyes turn red.</p><p></p><p>"We are truly unworthy of the Tiger God's nurturing. We've been living so well and comfortably here, completely forgetting to inform him."</p><p></p><p>Fenglong's face turned solemn: "No, although we have become domestic animals, we cannot let the Tiger God also become a domestic animal. His pride would never allow that."</p><p></p><p>"Right! We must release our aura. Although we are sealed, we can still do something. We must notify the Tiger God to flee quickly!</p><p></p><p>He must not encounter that fellow Ye Xiao, or else he won't be able to escape."</p><p></p><p>"Hurry! Let's all join forces to release our aura from this formation."</p><p></p><p>The Star Beasts united together, condensing their aura to a point, and let it seep out from the formation.</p>

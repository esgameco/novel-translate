        <h1>Chapter 30</h1>
        <div class="content">
            <p>Here is the full English translation of the Chinese excerpt:</p><p></p><p>The familiar voice made Ye Xiao turn his head to take a look.</p><p></p><p>It was actually Qin Yuyan.</p><p></p><p>Today, she was wearing a pure white mermaid dress, with light makeup and high heels, her graceful figure fully displayed.</p><p></p><p>"What are you doing here as well?"</p><p></p><p>"Luan Luan is my roommate and best friend, so I'm here as a bridesmaid!"</p><p></p><p>Luan Luan's surname was Lu, she was the daughter of Old Lu and the wife of Gu Hai.</p><p></p><p>Ye Xiao nodded without saying anything more.</p><p></p><p>He was not very familiar with her, so he didn't talk much. Especially with women, he talked even less.</p><p></p><p>So although they knew each other, Ye Xiao didn't intend to chat with her much.</p><p></p><p>This made Qin Yuyan feel a bit awkward. Just now, many men had asked for her contact information, but when it came to Ye Xiao, she was completely ignored.</p><p></p><p>But surprisingly, she quite liked being around Ye Xiao. This guy, although taciturn and not very talkative, at least wouldn't be buzzing around her ears like those flies.</p><p></p><p>So the two most good-looking people in the venue stood side by side in the corner, watching the wedding ceremony on stage.</p><p></p><p>On stage, it was lively and bustling, but Ye Xiao just watched.</p><p></p><p>Like him, a worker earning 3,000 a month with room and board provided, just watching was enough.</p><p></p><p>Gu Hai had his parents to fall back on, with a house, car, and job all taken care of. Ye Xiao was alone, with just over 10,000 in savings, unable to even support himself, let alone get married and find a woman.</p><p></p><p>No, wait, he had just given a wedding gift to Gu Hai, so now he had less than 8,000 left.</p><p></p><p>Thinking about his wallet, Ye Xiao subtly moved a bit further away from Qin Yuyan, maintaining a certain distance.</p><p></p><p>Surprisingly, after distancing himself from the woman, a vague sense of pressure mysteriously disappeared.</p><p></p><p>Ah, how comfortable!</p><p></p><p>The immersed Qin Yuyan didn't notice any of this.</p><p></p><p>Soon, the wedding ceremony reached its end. Luan Luan, with her back to the crowd, tossed the bouquet of flowers she was holding towards the back.</p><p></p><p>Whether it was intentional or not, her flowers just happened to land in Qin Yuyan's hands, in the corner where Ye Xiao and she were standing.</p><p></p><p>This drew the attention of the people present to this handsome couple in the corner, and they let out an "Ah~" sound, cheering them on.</p><p></p><p>Ye Xiao noticed Luan Luan giving Qin Yuyan a slight eyebrow raise. It was definitely intentional.</p><p></p><p>Qin Yuyan's small face flushed slightly, and she gently tucked a strand of hair behind her ear, looking a bit shy. This made quite a few men in the venue steal glances at her.</p><p></p><p>But seeing Ye Xiao standing next to Qin Yuyan, they quickly regained their composure.</p><p></p><p>Men are very rational creatures. Even if a woman is as beautiful as a goddess, if she is unattainable, she is no better than the girl in black stockings on the street.</p><p></p><p>After the celebration, it was time for the noon banquet.</p><p></p><p>The bridesmaids and groomsmen sat at the same table, while others chatted, but only Ye Xiao was silently eating.</p><p></p><p>He had been in this world for almost a year, and this was the best, highest-class meal he had eaten today, 2,800 per table. He couldn't afford to not eat.</p><p></p><p>Ye Xiao not only ate for himself, but also occasionally passed a chicken leg or a piece of fish to the illusory Liuli under the table.</p><p></p><p>After all, he had spent quite a bit on the wedding gift, so he needed to make up for it by eating more.</p><p></p><p>Some bridesmaids who wanted to get Ye Xiao's contact information saw Qin Yuyan next to him and tactfully gave up on their target.</p><p></p><p>The two of them were too good-looking, and their aura was too strong when seated together, making the others unable to hold back.</p><p></p><p>While everyone was chatting enthusiastically, the two of them were somewhat left out.</p><p></p><p>Ye Xiao was fine with that, as he was always taciturn with strangers.</p><p></p><p>Qin Yuyan, being a girl, had a slightly thinner skin, so she tried to chat with Ye Xiao from time to time to ease the awkwardness.</p><p></p><p>"Are you going to the library this afternoon?"</p><p></p><p>Ye Xiao shook his head.</p><p></p><p>"Not today, I took a day off."</p><p></p><p>Here is the full English translation of the Chinese excerpt:</p><p></p><p>"What are you going to do this afternoon?" Ye Xiao thought for a moment.</p><p></p><p>"I should go to the nearby bookstore to take a look."</p><p></p><p>His foundation in the spiritual system was still lacking the final technique, and then he could integrate it.</p><p></p><p>He couldn't find the last technique in the library, so it might be better to go to the bookstore.</p><p></p><p>The bookstore has a wide variety of books, so he might be able to find one.</p><p></p><p>Qin Yuyan felt a bit strange.</p><p></p><p>"The library should have the most complete collection of books. If you want to read, isn't it more convenient at the library?"</p><p></p><p>Ye Xiao shook his head.</p><p></p><p>"I've been studying spiritual system techniques recently, and the ones in the library aren't quite suitable for me."</p><p></p><p>Qin Yuyan knew that Ye Xiao had raised a Illusion Jade Qilin, and thought he wanted to cultivate spiritual techniques to become a beast tamer.</p><p></p><p>"Are you going to become a beast tamer? If that's the case, our family does have some rare techniques that were collected by my grandfather."</p><p></p><p>Ye Xiao was silent for a moment.</p><p></p><p>"Your grandfather's collection, I don't think it's suitable for me to look at."</p><p></p><p>Qin Yuyan shook her head.</p><p></p><p>"It's fine. All this time, whenever I went to the library, I always asked you for help. And this time, if you hadn't reminded me, I might not have had the courage to demonstrate my sword techniques in front of my grandfather.</p><p></p><p>So this time, let's just consider it as repaying the favor."</p><p></p><p>Ye Xiao nodded and didn't refuse.</p><p></p><p>Qin Yuyan learning her own sword intent was also quite valuable.</p><p></p><p>Looking at two books from the Qin family wouldn't be taking advantage of them.</p><p></p><p>After finishing the meal, the guests one by one bid farewell, and the bridesmaids and groomsmen also left separately.</p><p></p><p>Among them, there was a couple who directly went to the hotel front desk to get a room.</p><p></p><p>Ye Xiao also wiped his mouth, ready to leave. The Illusion Jade Qilin was very clever, and the first thing it did was leap into Qin Yuyan's arms, lying on the large and soft sofa.</p><p></p><p>Qin Yuyan didn't get angry, but instead gently held the soft body of the Illusion Jade Qilin.</p><p></p><p>It's just a small pet, how could it have any bad intentions?</p><p></p><p>Ye Xiao, on the other hand, was full of disdain for this Illusion Cat that had lived for more than 140 years.</p><p></p><p>It's already so old, yet it's still acting coy and cute all the time.</p><p></p><p>However, the lifespan of spirit beasts is generally very long, so Illusion Jade Qilin's age, at around seven or eight years old, is indeed considered a child among spirit beasts.</p><p></p><p>The two of them walked to Qin Yuyan's home.</p><p></p><p>Qin Yuyan couldn't help but feel a bit amused and distressed. Although she and Ye Xiao were just ordinary friends, she couldn't help but sigh inwardly.</p><p></p><p>This guy is truly a hardcore straight man, actually making her walk with him in high heels for several blocks on the street.</p><p></p><p>In fact, it's not that Ye Xiao is a hardcore straight man, but rather he doesn't want to get into a relationship right now.</p><p></p><p>This world is too dangerous, with the existence of spirit beasts. Without enough strength, he might face death and dire straits at any time.</p><p></p><p>Getting a girlfriend would only add more constraints. Moreover, girlfriends need to be coddled, which is not as comfortable as being single.</p><p></p><p>Eat when full, sleep when sleepy.</p><p></p><p>Most importantly, he has no money.</p><p></p><p>When you're poor, don't even think about a relationship, because it's all for naught.</p><p></p><p>When they arrived at Qin Yuyan's home, Ye Xiao was slightly amazed.</p><p></p><p>Qin Yuyan's home was several hundred square meters, a small villa, built in a low-key and luxurious style, with many pieces of extremely expensive rosewood furniture.</p><p></p><p>But considering Qin Shenglong's status, it was not surprising.</p><p></p><p>"Meow~!"</p><p></p><p>When passing through the courtyard, the Illusion Jade Qilin, which was lying on Qin Yuyan's chest, suddenly became excited.</p><p></p><p>One more update, please support.</p><p></p><p>(This chapter ends)</p>

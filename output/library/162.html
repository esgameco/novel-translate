        <h1>Chapter 162</h1>
        <div class="content">
            <p>Here is the full English translation of the Chinese excerpt:</p><p></p><p>"Why did someone ring the bell?"</p><p></p><p>"That shouldn't be the case, it's only been four minutes."</p><p></p><p>According to the competition rules, the bell can only be rung when the forging is completed.</p><p></p><p>If your skills are not enough, you can wait until the end of the competition. If you haven't finished the forging, you won't be penalized, at most your score won't look good.</p><p></p><p>If you ring the bell before the forging is completed, you will definitely be penalized, and the punishment will be quite severe.</p><p></p><p>Moreover, this kind of bad thing will also be recorded in your personal resume, which will have a huge impact on your future job search and the like.</p><p></p><p>After all, if you dare to arbitrarily forfeit in such a large-scale competition, what if the company lets you take on a job in the future? You just put down your tools, which company would dare to hire you?</p><p></p><p>So unless you have a screw loose, basically no one would do this.</p><p></p><p>The host also reacted very quickly, immediately shouting, "We just heard a contestant ring the bell, but the competition is only four minutes in, I don't know if this contestant accidentally touched it. Director, please switch to that contestant's camera and see if they encountered any problems."</p><p></p><p>The director quickly switched the monitoring camera to Ye Xiao's competition position.</p><p></p><p>To be honest, if he hadn't pressed the bell, the director would absolutely not have switched to his position.</p><p></p><p>Live broadcasting needs viewership to make money, and everyone wants to see those top-seeded players like Yu Qiuxuan and Song Qiufeng, those geniuses, not some unknown newcomer.</p><p></p><p>But when they shifted the monitor to that competition position, they saw the entire position was empty, and they were stunned for a moment.</p><p></p><p>"What's going on? Where did this kid go?"</p><p></p><p>"Yeah, where did he disappear to? He couldn't have run away, right? But if he ran away, the camera should have caught it, how come they didn't film it?"</p><p></p><p>"Hey, look, there's a short sword on the table, could it be the one he forged?"</p><p></p><p>Someone had already noticed a weapon lying quietly on the table in the competition position.</p><p></p><p>The host was somewhat surprised, completely unaware of what was going on.</p><p></p><p>"Where did this competition contestant go? He left an iron sword on the table, what does that mean?"</p><p></p><p>Everyone was puzzled, but at this moment, several professors on the jury panel, including Zhang Guangyang and Chen Danian, top-tier forging masters in the country, suddenly stood up.</p><p></p><p>"Wait, there seems to be something unusual about that sword."</p><p></p><p>The faces of these professors were extremely grave, all staring intently at that weapon.</p><p></p><p>The audience as a whole, naturally far below their level, unable to see the subtleties, the two hosts quickly helped voice the thoughts of everyone.</p><p></p><p>Zhang Guangyang and the other professors did not pay attention to them, but quickly went to Ye Xiao's competition position, picking up that precious sword. When they truly came into close contact with this sword, the group of professors were suddenly trembling with excitement.</p><p></p><p>"That's it! It really is! Unexpectedly, it's actually a secondary imperial weapon!"</p><p></p><p>"My goodness, this person is amazing. To use the competition materials, and in just four minutes, forge a secondary imperial weapon! How strong must his forging skills be?"</p><p></p><p>The professors present were not incapable of forging a secondary imperial weapon, but they would need to collect enough excellent materials and devote themselves to crafting for several days before they could forge a secondary imperial weapon, and there would still be a certain failure rate! But the other party only had four minutes, and the materials were the common competition materials.</p><p></p><p>If the materials were even better, they had no doubt that Ye Xiao could easily forge an imperial weapon!</p><p></p><p>And the time it would take would not be much longer than four minutes either.</p><p></p><p>With just this level of forging skills, he has already surpassed all the judges.</p><p></p><p>It's not just surpassing the other contestants, but the top-tier forging masters from all the major martial arts colleges. </p><p></p><p>Their level of skill is not just the top in the Nine Realms, but the absolute pinnacle.</p><p></p><p>Yet this one person alone is enough to look down on the top-tier forging masters of the Nine Realms' top martial arts colleges.</p><p></p><p>The audience looked even more puzzled, and the host spoke up again, "Professors, what is a secondary imperial weapon? Is it some new professional term? Or is this weapon forged in a special way?"</p><p></p><p>Information about imperial arts and imperial weapons is not very common in the world. First, ordinary people hardly ever encounter them, and second, these things involve certain secrets and are extremely powerful, so they cannot be casually revealed.</p><p></p><p>Zhang Guangyang looked at the short sword in his hand, took a deep breath, and said solemnly, "You can understand this sword as the strongest work in the history of the Nine Realms competition. This contestant's forging ability is probably not inferior to us professors, and may even far surpass our abilities!"</p><p></p><p>"What!"</p><p></p><p>"That's impossible, he's just an ordinary contestant!"</p><p></p><p>"Absolutely not, if he's that monstrous, I'll eat shit live on air."</p><p></p><p>"It's a lie, it has to be a lie."</p><p></p><p>At these words, the entire venue was in an uproar.</p><p></p><p>After all, the contestants are all young people under the age of thirty.</p><p></p><p>Here is my translation of the Chinese excerpt:</p><p></p><p>A blacksmith under the age of 30 has actually created the strongest work in the history of the Nine Provinces Competition?</p><p></p><p>And his blacksmithing skills may even surpass those of professors like Zhang Guangyang? This can't be a joke, right? But it doesn't seem like a joke either.</p><p></p><p>After all, the one saying this is Zhang Guangyang, the top blacksmithing professor at Sucheng Martial Arts University, and there are many other top professors from other colleges standing by his side, but not a single one has come out to refute him, which means this is 100% true.</p><p></p><p>The audience at the scene is both shocked and doubtful.</p><p></p><p>The viewership is also continuously rising.</p><p></p><p>The host whispers, "Camera, quick, give that sword a separate high-definition shot."</p><p></p><p>She then immediately asks:</p><p></p><p>"Professor Zhang, Professor Chen, you say this sword is of an extremely high level, how did you determine that?"</p><p></p><p>Zhang Guangyang takes a deep breath, then tosses the sword high into the air. </p><p></p><p>As the sword enters the sky, it pauses for a moment, then begins to emit a trembling sound and start circling on its own in the air.</p><p></p><p>"Damn!"</p><p></p><p>The entire audience is collectively dumbfounded.</p><p></p><p>It's known that even a grandmaster-level weapon requires a martial artist to infuse it with spiritual energy in order to control it over a short distance.</p><p></p><p>But this sword has already begun to absorb spiritual energy on its own.</p><p></p><p>Incredible! </p><p>This sword is incredible!</p><p></p><p>"Awesome!"</p><p>"Can't argue with that!"</p><p>"Dark horse! This is definitely the dark horse! The champion of this competition has been born."</p><p>"But who is he exactly?"</p><p></p><p>At these words, the host immediately shouts, "Director, please pull up the monitoring footage of this competition position so we can confirm his identity."</p><p></p><p>The director immediately switches it over, and everyone's gaze is immediately focused there.</p><p></p><p>Even those professors are staring intently, more eager than the ordinary spectators to know the identity of this mysterious blacksmith. </p><p></p><p>This is an extremely rare and exceptional blacksmith, and if they could find him, it would be an enormous blessing for the blacksmithing world of the Nine Provinces, as he could raise the level immensely. </p><p></p><p>However, when the director switches to the footage of Ye Xiao's competition position, it's black screen the entire time.</p><p></p><p>"What's going on? Director, please switch it back immediately, we need to see the video of that competitor."</p><p></p><p>The director shouts, "It's already switched, but it's just a black screen, we couldn't capture him the entire time."</p><p></p><p>"What? Such an exciting competition, and we couldn't capture him? Did the camera break down?"</p><p></p><p>"No, the cameras are all working fine, but they were just interfered with."</p><p></p><p>As soon as he says this, someone in the crowd can't help but exclaim, "It's a grandmaster! His cultivation is above grandmaster level, so when he unleashes his spiritual energy, he can affect electronic devices, which is why the cameras couldn't capture him."</p><p></p><p>"Damn, no wonder he disappeared so quickly, it's because he's above grandmaster level. That makes sense, no wonder no one saw him vanish."</p><p></p><p>"This person's blacksmithing skills are so strong, and his cultivation is also at grandmaster level. He's a true prodigy!"</p><p></p><p>Zhang Guangyang and the others exchange a glance, unable to suppress their sighs.</p><p></p><p>"We all thought our blacksmithing skills were already at the top level in the Nine Provinces, but today we've learned that there are people beyond us, heavens beyond the heavens!</p><p></p><p>Ashamed, truly ashamed!"</p><p></p><p>"But why did he come to participate in this competition? If his skills are so strong, why didn't he want to show himself and let us see?"</p><p></p><p>Chen Danian ponders for a moment, then his gaze sweeps over to the disappeared space amethyst on the podium.</p><p></p><p>"If I'm not mistaken, he must have come for the fifth place prize, the space amethyst. The reason he participated in the competition was probably just to avoid stealing the prize."</p><p></p><p>"This person not only has enough strength, but his blacksmithing skills are also superb, and his character is worthy of respect as well. He is truly a master, without a doubt."</p><p></p><p>The spectators are filled with amazement and speculation. Discussions about this mysterious competitor are flooding the internet, spreading like wildfire and quickly becoming a hot topic.</p><p></p><p>"Heavens, in the past there were always rumors about hidden masters in the Nine Provinces besides the obvious ones, and I didn't believe it, but now it seems to be true."</p><p></p><p>"He has the strength, but he didn't directly take the space amethyst, instead participating in the competition. In just four minutes, he created a sword that shocked all the judges, and then only took the fifth place prize, the space amethyst. </p><p></p><p>This person is incredible, I love it!"</p><p></p><p>"Fellow netizens, today we couldn't find this master, so all of us here are guilty!"</p>

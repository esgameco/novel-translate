        <h1>Chapter 167</h1>
        <div class="content">
            <p>Here is the full English translation of the Chinese excerpt:</p><p></p><p>But he hadn't walked a few steps when he felt something was a bit off.</p><p></p><p>Today, there were very few people around.</p><p></p><p>The streets were sparse, completely different from the usual scene.</p><p></p><p>After all, it was broad daylight, not late at night when people would be staying home in their beds.</p><p></p><p>The people shouldn't be at home.</p><p></p><p>Tai Xuan Tian Gang swept a glance, and Ye Xiao's expression instantly became a bit strange.</p><p></p><p>All the people were gathered at the riverside, and there were even four Shen Zong of the Xiantian Eighth Rank.</p><p></p><p>There was also a Shen Zong of the Xiantian Ninth Rank in the sky.</p><p></p><p>Wow, did the Jianghai City suddenly strike gold? So many powerful experts gathered together? Are they playing cards?</p><p></p><p>No, something seems a bit off.</p><p></p><p>Ye Xiao suddenly remembered that before he left, Gu Hai had mentioned something.</p><p></p><p>That Sword Saint of Hanzhou, Liu Chengxun, and the Ninjutsu God of Yingzhou, Murasame Kyouji, were going to come challenge him.</p><p></p><p>He had been so busy after leaving, slaying Shen Zong spirit beasts, going to Sucheng to get the spatial purple crystal, and encountering Fa Xin, that he had forgotten about this matter.</p><p></p><p>However, Ye Xiao soon shook his head.</p><p></p><p>He didn't want to participate in any competition.</p><p></p><p>He wasn't that bored.</p><p></p><p>And he also didn't want to expose himself in front of everyone.</p><p></p><p>That Shen Zong of the Xiantian Ninth Rank, judging from the aura, was most likely Sword Saint Lu Qingshan, and he had even come in his true body.</p><p></p><p>If he went there, he would definitely get entangled by Lu Qingshan.</p><p></p><p>It would be much more interesting to wait for his goddaughter to be born.</p><p></p><p>Thinking of this, Ye Xiao went to find a flower shop.</p><p></p><p>In the sky, Sword Saint Lu Qingshan slightly furrowed his brows, looking a bit puzzled at what was happening below.</p><p></p><p>Disciple Xian noticed his unusual behavior and immediately asked, "Master, what are you looking for?"</p><p></p><p>Lu Qingshan was slightly perplexed as he replied:</p><p></p><p>"Just now, I seemed to have sensed an extremely powerful spiritual force, but when I carefully searched for it, I couldn't find it anymore."</p><p></p><p>"What? Someone actually managed to evade your spiritual force scan? You are a peak expert of the Xiantian Ninth Rank Shen Zong!"</p><p></p><p>Lu Qingshan shook his head slightly.</p><p></p><p>"I don't know, maybe I just imagined it?"</p><p></p><p>On Ye Xiao's side, he had arrived at a flower shop.</p><p></p><p>"Boss, please prepare the best bouquet for me. Something with a gentle fragrance, not too pungent. Money is not a concern."</p><p></p><p>"Okay."</p><p></p><p>Hearing Ye Xiao's generous words, the shop owner immediately started bustling about.</p><p></p><p>Ye Xiao then sat on the sofa and played with his phone.</p><p></p><p>At this moment, the shop owner's son, who was playing on the computer behind the counter, suddenly burst into a furious cursing.</p><p></p><p>"Damn! Those fucking Koreans and Japanese! They are shameless."</p><p></p><p>The shop owner glared at him while packing the flowers.</p><p></p><p>"You little bastard, be quiet. Can't you see there's a customer here?"</p><p></p><p>"Dad! I can't stand it anymore! Look at these bastards, as long as the Sword Immortal doesn't make a move, they start mocking and sarcastic remarks online, insulting our Jiuzhou. They even mock the Sword Immortal."</p><p></p><p>Ye Xiao raised his eyebrows slightly and opened a live streaming app, clicking on one of the more popular live streams.</p><p></p><p>It turned out that the top ten or so live streams were all from people broadcasting near the riverside of Jianghai City.</p><p></p><p>He didn't expect this incident to attract so much attention.</p><p></p><p>However, the comments in the live streams were also quite unharmonious.</p><p></p><p>And very unharmonious! Since he hadn't made a move, many people were mocking him. Calling him a coward, afraid to act, a wimp. Ye Xiao didn't really care about these keyboard warriors.</p><p></p><p>It's not like he could go through the internet and fight them one by one, right? They were all far away in places like Hanzhou or even further.</p><p></p><p>If he got angry at keyboard warriors, he'd have to eliminate hundreds of billions of people worldwide, and it still might not be enough to resolve it.</p><p></p><p>But some people had already escalated this matter to the level of the Jiuzhou, mocking the spirit of Jiuzhou, and this was something Ye Xiao couldn't accept.</p><p></p><p>As long as one has a bit of fighting spirit, a true man, they wouldn't be able to tolerate it either!</p><p></p><p>"Sir, your flowers are ready."</p><p></p><p>At this moment, the shop owner smiled and handed the bouquet to Ye Xiao.</p><p></p><p>Ye Xiao thanked him and took the bouquet, then his gaze fell on a cluster of red roses in the shop.</p><p></p><p>"Boss, can I take two more flowers?"</p><p></p><p>"Of course, no problem. Two is enough? If not, you can take a few more."</p><p></p><p>This boss was really good at doing business.</p><p></p><p>"No, two is enough."</p><p></p><p>"Okay, customer, please take your time. Welcome to come again."</p><p></p><p>Ye Xiao lightly hummed in acknowledgment, then turned and used the Tai Xuan Tian Gang to erase the boss's memory.</p><p></p><p>Afterwards, Ye Xiao came to the street, first putting the flowers for his goddaughter into his storage ring, then infusing the Domineering Sword Dao and the Heavenly Slash Sword Dao into the two red roses respectively.</p><p></p><p>Originally, these were just two ordinary red roses, unable to withstand Ye Xiao's vast sword and blade intents.</p><p></p><p>But Ye Xiao had inscribed formations on the two flowers, using the Dizhao Tiangang Formation to lock the sword and blade intents within the two flowers.</p><p></p><p>At this moment, the interiors of these two flowers had already been shattered, filled with extremely fierce killing intent.</p><p></p><p>It was just that they were surrounded by the Imperial Formation and could not be released outward.</p><p></p><p>Ye Xiao then released his spiritual force into them, using it as the trigger condition.</p><p></p><p>Here is the full English translation of the Chinese excerpt:</p><p></p><p>In this way, two flowers with extremely powerful striking power were created.</p><p></p><p>He waved to a girl by the side of the road.</p><p></p><p>"Help me send these two flowers to the riverside, one thousand dollars, will you do it?"</p><p></p><p>The girl, seeing Ye Xiao's face, blushed slightly, without even thinking, she directly nodded and agreed.</p><p></p><p>"Okay!"</p><p></p><p>Ye Xiao took out a thousand cash for her, and also gave an extra hundred for the taxi fare.</p><p></p><p>"One of the flowers is for Liu Chengxun, the other is for Cun Shang Bianxian."</p><p></p><p>After giving the instructions, Ye Xiao then deleted the memory of himself from the other party's mind.</p><p></p><p>Letting the other party only remember their task.</p><p></p><p>He then directly headed to the hospital.</p><p></p><p>On the riverside, the crowd had already become a little impatient while waiting.</p><p></p><p>Although there were five Saint Monarch experts here who could be watched, the novelty would soon pass.</p><p></p><p>No matter how good the Saint Monarch experts were, they could not be eaten as food! Many people had come here since morning, fighting for a good position, and they hadn't even had breakfast yet.</p><p></p><p>If this continued, they might not even be able to have their lunch.</p><p></p><p>"Senior Sword Saint, are you coming or not?"</p><p></p><p>"Could it be that Senior Sword Saint is really afraid, so he doesn't dare to come?"</p><p></p><p>"That's nonsense, how could Senior Sword Saint be afraid? He is absolutely fearless. He is also a Saint Monarch!"</p><p></p><p>"That's right, moreover, there are three Saint Monarchs from our Nine States here, including the Sword Saint Lu Qingshan. With so many people backing up Senior Sword Saint, how could he be a coward? He doesn't need to worry about the other side trying to kill him."</p><p></p><p>"But... why hasn't he come yet?"</p><p></p><p>The crowd quickly started a new discussion, discussing the possible situations Senior Sword Saint might be in, perhaps he was about to break through, or perhaps he was not in the Jianghai City.</p><p></p><p>In any case, the vast majority of people did not believe that Senior Sword Saint was a coward.</p><p></p><p>Qin Shenglong couldn't help but frown and said, "Why hasn't this Senior Sword Saint appeared yet?"</p><p></p><p>Dou Changfeng analyzed:</p><p></p><p>"Senior Sword Saint has always been mysterious.</p><p></p><p>All this time, he has never shown his face in public, and has never revealed his identity.</p><p></p><p>If I guess correctly, it's because the Senior's temperament is too 'Buddhist'.</p><p></p><p>What he is interested in is probably just the Dao of the Sword. That's why he has become so strong.</p><p></p><p>Aside from the Dao of the Sword, he is too lazy to participate in anything else."</p><p></p><p>"But now, this is for the glory of the Nine States! If he doesn't come out, the people of the whole world might laugh at us Nine States.</p><p></p><p>Finally, a powerful expert appears, but he doesn't dare to accept the challenges from Liu Chengxun and Cun Shang Bianxian."</p><p></p><p>"Yuyan, you have a slight acquaintance with the Senior, what do you think?</p><p></p><p>Will Senior Sword Saint come?"</p><p></p><p>"I can't say for sure." </p><p></p><p>A trace of bitterness appeared at the corner of Qin Yuyan's mouth.</p><p></p><p>"Although I don't know why, the Senior really doesn't like to expose his identity.</p><p></p><p>I wanted to become his disciple, but he didn't accept me, he only gave me a sword intent.</p><p></p><p>So getting him to come out and fight these two people will be difficult.</p><p></p><p>However, this is definitely not because he is a coward. I believe in the Senior's strength, he can handle the two of them. The Senior is just too 'Buddhist', just as Grandpa Dou said!"</p><p></p><p>As she said this, Qin Yuyan's mind suddenly, inexplicably, thought of Ye Xiao.</p><p></p><p>Ye Xiao seemed to be the most 'Buddhist' among the people she had encountered.</p><p></p><p>He didn't look for a partner, didn't talk about love, didn't care about promotion and salary increase, he just knew to read books every day, going back and forth between the library and home, not much better than a shut-in.</p><p></p><p>But soon, she was startled.</p><p></p><p>Why did she think of him?</p><p></p><p>She must have had a brain freeze.</p><p></p><p>Although he is also very 'Buddhist', he is just a man in his twenties! If he could be Senior Sword Saint, then his talent must be monstrous to the extreme? A Saint Monarch at the age of twenty? </p><p></p><p>This would be even more unbelievable than Sword Saint Lu Qingshan's early breakthrough.</p><p></p><p>Impossible, impossible, absolutely impossible!</p><p></p><p>If it were Ye Xiao, he must not be human.</p><p></p><p>And he is a human, so it absolutely cannot be him!</p><p></p><p>Just at this moment, a girl suddenly ran over from a distance, holding two red roses high in her hands.</p><p></p><p>"Make way, everyone make way, let me through."</p><p></p><p>The crowd started to get restless, looking at her with some puzzlement.</p><p></p><p>"What is she doing?"</p><p></p><p>And in the sky above, Lu Qingshan, seeing those two flowers, suddenly had his pupils contract.</p><p></p><p>"He's here!"</p><p></p><p>His disciple Xian'er beside him was completely dumbfounded.</p><p></p><p>"Is she the Sword Saint? Impossible, her aura is only at the Postmortal Third Grade. Even if she's hiding her aura, this still doesn't seem right!"</p><p></p><p>Lu Qingshan shook his head.</p><p></p><p>"I'm not talking about her, but the two red roses in her hands."</p><p></p><p>"Red roses?"</p><p></p><p>It's the seventh update, 21,000 words, my eyes are getting blurry and everything is blurred.</p><p></p><p>I can't hold on anymore.</p><p></p><p>Subscription doesn't work, monthly votes don't work, recommendation tickets don't work either, maybe the writing is just not good enough.</p><p></p><p>Thank you to book friend 20210727220139645 for the reward, I'm very grateful.</p><p></p><p>(This chapter is complete)</p>

        <h1>Chapter 152</h1>
        <div class="content">
            <p>Here is the full English translation of the Chinese excerpt:</p><p></p><p>Ye Xiao climbed out of the mountain with some embarrassment.</p><p></p><p>Of course, his body was fine, with just a little dust on him.</p><p></p><p>Just like when he advanced to the Innate Seventh Grade, after advancing to the Innate Eighth Grade, Ye Xiao's cultivation had suddenly increased tremendously, to the point that he had difficulty controlling it if he didn't practice for a while.</p><p></p><p>After using the Divine Will Technique, the speed was so fast that even he couldn't imagine it.</p><p></p><p>Just a moment ago, he was still in the Ten Thousand Mountains between the Central State and the Chu State, but in just a few seconds, he had returned to the Jianghai City.</p><p></p><p>Ye Xiao estimated that if he were to face his former Innate Seventh Grade self, he could easily crush him with just one hand now.</p><p></p><p>So powerful! The Innate Eighth Grade was already this strong, he couldn't even imagine how terrifying the Innate Ninth Grade would be.</p><p></p><p>And what about the Monarch Realm and the Emperor Realm beyond that? How powerful would they be?</p><p></p><p>Just the thought of it made Ye Xiao's heart race, and he couldn't help but feel a sense of longing.</p><p></p><p>He used to be more Buddhist-like, but now his mentality had changed.</p><p></p><p>After getting a taste of power, he craved it even more.</p><p></p><p>Ye Xiao remembered hearing an elder say before that if a person hadn't made any money, they would have a hard time putting in the effort, because they couldn't feel the joy and allure of wealth.</p><p></p><p>But once they start earning money and experiencing the stimulation of their most primal ambitions through consumption, the entire person would become very driven to make more money.</p><p></p><p>It seemed that he was now in a similar situation.</p><p></p><p>Previously, he didn't think he could become this strong. Although the Sect Master was already impressive, their abilities were ultimately limited. But now, Ye Xiao felt like he could shake the Heavenly Might.</p><p></p><p>The difference was truly immense.</p><p></p><p>The human heart could indeed change.</p><p></p><p>Recalling the majestic moment when he had cleaved through the calamitous clouds, Ye Xiao doubted he would ever again submit to anyone in this lifetime.</p><p></p><p>Perhaps this was the pride of the strong. At this moment, many people were gathering by the river, and with a step, Ye Xiao quickly disappeared from the spot.</p><p></p><p>This time, he didn't use the Divine Will Technique, so his speed was more moderate.</p><p></p><p>However, even so, Ye Xiao felt his speed was still shockingly fast.</p><p></p><p>It seemed he would need to spend the next few days learning how to perfectly control the power of the Innate Eighth Grade.</p><p></p><p>When Ye Xiao returned home, it was almost dawn.</p><p></p><p>But when he opened the door, he couldn't help but freeze in place.</p><p></p><p>Lying on the sofa was a beautiful young girl.</p><p></p><p>She had a pair of cat ears, a well-proportioned figure, and was on par with Qin Yuyan and Yang Qian.</p><p></p><p>Completely unmatched! Especially her face, delicate and translucent, her skin quality far surpassing many women.</p><p></p><p>Those long, slender legs, like chopsticks, looked even more refined wrapped in black stockings.</p><p></p><p>"Hehe, I want to eat chicken wings, Master. Spicy chicken wings..."</p><p></p><p>At this moment, the other party muttered in her sleep, and Ye Xiao could guess with his little toe that it was Illusion Crystalline.</p><p></p><p>And she had already broken through to the Innate Fifth Grade.</p><p></p><p>Indeed, his star pet was worthy of the title, her speed of advancement was truly remarkable.</p><p></p><p>The power of the Dragon-level bloodline would become more and more apparent as time went on.</p><p></p><p>Ordinary star beasts, due to the lack of bloodline power, would find it increasingly difficult to advance. Some might even be unable to advance at all.</p><p></p><p>But Illusion Crystalline didn't have to worry about that.</p><p></p><p>Additionally, the Illusion Cat bloodline, while focused on cultivating spiritual power, could also obtain the power of other powerful Dragon-level bloodline star beasts after devouring their bloodlines or star cores.</p><p></p><p>If he could find some suitable bloodlines for her, allowing her to also possess the power of spiritual combat, her potential would be even more incalculable.</p><p></p><p>At that time, he wouldn't even need to intervene in many matters, as he could just assign them to Illusion Crystalline.</p><p></p><p>Perfect!</p><p></p><p>However, at this moment, Illusion Crystalline turned over, changing from a prone to a supine sleeping position.</p><p></p><p>Ye Xiao: "(⊙⊙)!"</p><p></p><p>Could this be the legendary "paid exclusive"?</p><p></p><p>Ye Xiao sighed inwardly, then covered her with the blanket.</p><p></p><p>It seems he couldn't let Illusion Crystalline continue sleeping on the sofa in the future. After all, the child had grown up, and since she was so filial and well-cared for by Grandma, it would be right to reward her.</p><p></p><p>He would give her a dedicated small room of her own tomorrow.</p><p></p><p>Time quickly passed to the next day. On his way to work, after finishing breakfast, Ye Xiao passed by Old Man Xu's shop and saw Old Man Xu holding a suitcase, standing at the door and instructing his daughter.</p><p></p><p>Now that Ye Xiao had advanced to the Innate Eighth Grade, even without using the Grand Heavenly Technique, he could easily hear voices from far away.</p><p></p><p>"Remember, don't sell the items at the wrong price. If there are any you don't know the price of, call me immediately."</p><p></p><p>"I know."</p><p></p><p>"While I'm away these few days, don't accept any weapons. Some little brats might try to pawn off inferior goods when I'm not around."</p><p></p><p>"Mm-hmm."</p><p></p><p>Here is the full English translation of the Chinese excerpt:</p><p></p><p>"And also, that Ye Xiao, don't be fooled by his good looks, his heart is wicked. You must absolutely not have too much interaction with him. Understand?"</p><p></p><p>"Okay!" After delivering these few words, the boss Mr. Xu turned around and prepared to get in the car. In the moment he turned around, his gaze just happened to sweep over Ye Xiao.</p><p></p><p>He first paused, then let out a light snort and turned to leave.</p><p></p><p>Ye Xiao wasn't angry either, after all, he was the one who had turned Mr. Xu into this state.</p><p></p><p>Previously, in order to prevent Mr. Xu from being searched and having his self-made throwing knives discovered, Ye Xiao had made it seem like Mr. Xu lost over a hundred thousand to him.</p><p></p><p>From then on, Mr. Xu no longer treated him well.</p><p></p><p>As long as he had erased that segment of memory, and wouldn't be exposed through a search, it was fine that he was a master forger.</p><p></p><p>After Mr. Xu got in the car and left, Ye Xiao came to the shop door and curiously asked Big Cat:</p><p></p><p>"Big Cat, your dad was acting so strange, where did he go?"</p><p></p><p>"My dad told me not to talk to you."</p><p></p><p>Ye Xiao handed out two buns.</p><p></p><p>"Here, red bean buns, still hot."</p><p></p><p>Big Cat hesitated for a moment, then took the buns.</p><p></p><p>"I tell you, you absolutely can't tell my dad."</p><p></p><p>"Okay."</p><p></p><p>Big Cat glanced in the direction his father had left, making sure he wouldn't come back, then bit into the bun with a satisfied expression and said:</p><p></p><p>"My dad went to Jiangzhou, to the Shu City area, to hold a forging competition. I heard there are very rich prizes."</p><p></p><p>"What kind of prizes?"</p><p></p><p>"The prizes seem to be of several types, there's the secret metal for forging weapons, there's ten thousand year meteorite iron, there's ten thousand year golden sand, materials from divine lord-level spirit beasts, oh right, and there's also a spatial amethyst crystal."</p><p></p><p>Ye Xiao's gaze suddenly sharpened.</p><p></p><p>A spatial amethyst crystal! A good thing! That is a type of spatial material, its grade far surpasses that of obsidian, and the spatial force it can store is countless times stronger.</p><p></p><p>His spatial ring was made of obsidian, and he had been worrying about not being able to infuse it with more spatial force.</p><p></p><p>Unexpectedly, he had just gotten news of a spatial amethyst crystal.</p><p></p><p>It seems he must find a way to obtain this spatial amethyst crystal.</p><p></p><p>"By the way, when will your dad start forging?"</p><p></p><p>"My dad can't forge, he's just going to take the opportunity to buy a batch of weapons. There will be many forging masters participating in the competition, they'll definitely forge a lot of good weapons, but my dad isn't competing."</p><p></p><p>"I see, well I have to get to work, I'm almost late."</p><p></p><p>"You absolutely can't tell my dad that I talked to you, otherwise he'll scold me again."</p><p></p><p>Big Cat couldn't help but remind him one more time.</p><p></p><p>"Don't worry."</p><p></p><p>Ye Xiao turned and left, inwardly scheming.</p><p></p><p>Speaking of which, Jie Feng has been gone for a long time. She should have already found other divine lord-level spirit beasts by now, right? He should also go look for Jie Feng and catch a few spirit beasts while he's at it.</p><p></p><p>Later, he could keep them penned up like pets, and when he wanted to eat meat, he could just slaughter half of one, eat half, and use the other half to revive it, maintaining a long-term supply. </p><p></p><p>The meat of divine lord-level spirit beasts not only has an unparalleled taste compared to ordinary food, but it also contains a vast spiritual energy that can bring many beneficial effects, especially in the realm of cultivation.</p><p></p><p>He might as well take a few days off.</p><p></p><p>After all, the Seven Star Convergence has already ended, so there won't be too much danger for now.</p><p></p><p>And Director Ouyang hasn't retired yet, and Yang Chun is covering his area, so taking a few days off won't cause any trouble.</p><p></p><p>Half an hour later.</p><p></p><p>"You say... you want to take leave?" </p><p></p><p>In the director's office, Ouyang Yunzhong looked at Ye Xiao's leave request and pushed up his glasses.</p><p></p><p>"This is really a rare occurrence, you normally don't take leave, and even on weekends you come to the library, spending more time there than at home.</p><p></p><p>And now you actually want to take leave."</p><p></p><p>Ye Xiao nodded.</p><p></p><p>"I recently met an online friend, and we made plans to meet up in person."</p><p></p><p>"Oh, so you've finally started thinking about the big matters of life? Then I'll approve this leave for you. Otherwise, I'd be sinning greatly."</p><p></p><p>Ouyang Yunzhong immediately approved Ye Xiao's leave request.</p><p></p><p>"Ten days should be enough, I'll give you ten days. The library isn't too busy during this period anyway, and Yang Chun is covering for you, so you can go with peace of mind."</p><p></p><p>"Thank you, Director."</p><p></p><p>Ye Xiao took the approval and left.</p><p></p><p>As for Director Ouyang, she looked at Ye Xiao's retreating back with some concern.</p><p></p><p>"This child is too naive, every day it's just work and home, nothing else. I hope he won't be deceived. I've heard that these days, a lot of the people meeting up are old ladies."</p><p></p><p>After a pause, she shook her head.</p><p></p><p>"Nevermind, it shouldn't be a big deal, even if it's really old ladies, Ye Xiao won't be at a loss, after all he's a man. Besides, falling into a pit and gaining wisdom, let it be a tempering experience for him."</p><p></p><p>(This chapter ends)</p>

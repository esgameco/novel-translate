        <h1>Chapter 410</h1>
        <div class="content">
            <p>Here is the full English translation of the Chinese excerpt:</p><p></p><p>Blood Butterfly! A very beautiful name.</p><p></p><p>According to legend, it is the transformation of a Goddess Empress.</p><p></p><p>The Goddess Empress once had a great love, the expectation of her life.</p><p></p><p>But unfortunately, the other party betrayed their love that was supposed to last until death, and fell in love with another Goddess Empress.</p><p></p><p>This Goddess Empress, after countless pleas, was unable to regain the other's affection. In her fury, she used the power and techniques she had cultivated her entire life to condense and transform into a type of curse.</p><p></p><p>That is the Blood Butterfly.</p><p></p><p>Using this curse, she devoured the other Goddess Empress, making the other's body her own puppet, and the male God Empress once again became her great love.</p><p></p><p>Until the male God Empress had gone through several women, he finally discovered this secret.</p><p></p><p>Because every woman he found would eventually develop the same habits, the same hobbies. At this point, the Blood Butterfly was finally exposed to the world!</p><p></p><p>People discovered for the first time that this thing was actually so terrifying. It took a great deal of effort to destroy this poisonous curse, but they were unable to destroy the method of creating it, so it was passed down.</p><p></p><p>However, although this curse is extremely demonic, its power is determined by the level of its creator.</p><p></p><p>The one who created this Blood Butterfly must be weaker than that Goddess Empress, otherwise Jing Emperor and the others would have died long ago, how could they have lasted for a few days? Ye Xiao stepped forward and used the Immortal Treasure Art, using the power of the Immortal Treasure Art to suppress the continued outbreak of the Blood Butterfly within Jing Emperor, causing it to stop operating, and Jing Emperor slowly regained consciousness.</p><p></p><p>"Ye Xiao, how did I end up here? Where is this place?"</p><p></p><p>"This is the hospital."</p><p></p><p>"The hospital? Oh yes, I seem to have been sick."</p><p></p><p>Ye Xiao nodded.</p><p></p><p>"I thought I was going to die. Thank goodness for you. Have you already cured me?"</p><p></p><p>"Not yet."</p><p></p><p>The Blood Butterfly is not a treasure art, but it is infinitely close to a treasure art.</p><p></p><p>It has one very troublesome problem, which is that it has completely fused with Jing Emperor's physical body.</p><p></p><p>To put it simply, it has now become a part of Jing Emperor. It is neither a toxin nor a disease to Jing Emperor, but equivalent to Jing Emperor's own blood cells, except that it has a separate consciousness.</p><p></p><p>Any action it takes will be seen as Jing Emperor's own physical actions.</p><p></p><p>Even if Ye Xiao were to kill Jing Emperor and then revive him with the Immortal Treasure Art, the Blood Butterfly would still exist within Jing Emperor.</p><p></p><p>The Immortal Treasure Art cannot completely destroy it either, but requires the cultivation of the Immortal Treasure Art.</p><p></p><p>This Blood Butterfly is definitely useless against Ye Xiao, not only because the Immortal Treasure Art does not approve, but even Ye Xiao's Poison God Absolute and Nine Star Poison Art would not agree.</p><p></p><p>Ye Xiao can only use the Immortal Treasure Art to inject energy into Jing Emperor's body to suppress the Blood Butterfly, because it is only an energy released by the Immortal Treasure Art, not the true rule power of the Immortal Treasure Art's endless cycle.</p><p></p><p>It's like a medicine, the effect remains in the body, then it is effective, but when the medicine effect disappears, the disease will definitely relapse.</p><p></p><p>Like Ye Xiao, who cultivates the Immortal Treasure Art and has endless medicinal power, the Blood Butterfly is naturally useless.</p><p></p><p>Now there are only three ways to destroy the Blood Butterfly.</p><p></p><p>The first is to destroy the existence that created the Blood Butterfly.</p><p></p><p>But who knows who created it? The person behind it must have hidden away long ago. The one who can create such a thing is definitely not a fool.</p><p></p><p>It's even possible that the creator of this thing is among the Hundred Clan Alliance.</p><p></p><p>Finding him is like trying to find a needle in a vast ocean, completely unrealistic!</p><p></p><p>The second is to pass on the Immortal Treasure Art to Jing Emperor.</p><p></p><p>In this way, Jing Emperor will possess the cyclic and endless power of the Immortal Treasure Art.</p><p></p><p>But the ancient treasure art is his biggest secret, and he definitely can't just casually pass it on.</p><p></p><p>And not only Jing Emperor is sick here, if he passes it on to Jing Emperor, what about the others? Are the other people not going to be saved?</p><p></p><p>These are all senior figures in the Nine Provinces who have helped him to varying degrees.</p><p></p><p>As for the Poison God Absolute, it can be passed on.</p><p></p><p>But the problem is, the Poison God Absolute must be cultivated to the Great Perfection state before they are infected with the Blood Butterfly.</p><p></p><p>Now everything is too late.</p><p></p><p>If they cultivate it now, it's not the Poison God Absolute rejecting the Blood Butterfly, but the Blood Butterfly rejecting the Poison God Absolute.</p><p></p><p>Because the Blood Butterfly has already taken root and sprouted in their bodies.</p><p></p><p>The third is simpler, which is to refine a pill, using the pill to lure the Blood Butterfly into it, and then expel it from the body.</p><p></p><p>Ye Xiao even knows the formula for the pill and can easily refine it.</p><p></p><p>The only problem is that the materials are hard to find.</p><p></p><p>He has many materials, but not every one is specifically for countering the Blood Butterfly, it requires extremely special materials.</p><p></p><p>At this moment, he felt a special aura coming from outside, and he comforted Jing Emperor:</p><p></p><p>"Senior Zhu, you wait here for a few more days, I'll think of a way. I've used a special technique to suppress the curse in your bodies, so you won't have any problems for now."</p><p></p><p>Jing Emperor nodded.</p><p></p><p>"Okay, we'll wait for you."</p><p></p><p>"And one more thing, you are all in a comatose state right now, so it's best not to..."</p><p></p><p>Here is my translation of the Chinese excerpt:</p><p></p><p>"Feel free to expose yourself, so that the Ning family doesn't notice. I don't want to reveal my identity yet."</p><p></p><p>Emperor Jing nodded again.</p><p></p><p>"Don't worry, I understand."</p><p></p><p>"Then I'll be going first. I'll find a way to come rescue you all later."</p><p></p><p>"Thank you for your help." Ye Xiao bid farewell to Emperor Jing and turned to leave.</p><p></p><p>In the hospital lobby, Ning Zhiyuan was being escorted by a group of powerful Ning family members, listening to a healer from the Xuanyuan Clan analyze the situation.</p><p></p><p>"Master Cheng, are you saying they are not actually sick, but rather afflicted by a demonic poison?"</p><p></p><p>Master Cheng nodded.</p><p></p><p>"That's right, it's the Blood Butterfly, an ancient and vicious demonic poison. In its final stage, it can completely turn a person into a living puppet."</p><p></p><p>"Then how can we treat it?"</p><p></p><p>Master Cheng said gravely, "As of now, the only way to treat it is through medicinal pills that can draw out the Blood Butterfly poison."</p><p></p><p>"Then let's immediately have the alchemists start refining the pills. Aren't Master Chen and a few other great alchemists here? Please have them lend a hand to refine the medicine, it shouldn't be a problem."</p><p></p><p>"The alchemists aren't the issue. With my understanding, Old Chen and the others can definitely refine suitable medicinal pills. The problem now is the materials! This is the remote Canglang Star Domain, not the central region of the Xuanyuan Clan's domain. Where can we find enough materials out here in this remote place?"</p><p></p><p>"Materials?" Ning Zhiyuan thought for a moment. "Just give me a list of what materials are needed. I just retrieved some materials from the Divine King's Tomb that haven't been transferred back to the Ning Clan yet. And I can also borrow some from Ling Shaoyu. </p><p></p><p>With the alchemy material reserves from two Divine King's Tombs, there's no way we can't refine this medicine."</p><p></p><p>Master Cheng nodded. "If Young Master says so, then I'll be at ease. Let me write up the list so they can start refining the pills."</p><p></p><p>Ning Zhiyuan nodded. "I'll go upstairs to see my uncle first. Master Cheng, you can get to work."</p><p></p><p>"Yes, I'll take my leave then." Master Cheng departed, and Ning Zhiyuan immediately headed upstairs. </p><p></p><p>As he reached the staircase, he bumped into Ye Xiao, passing by him. Ning Zhiyuan couldn't help but raise an eyebrow slightly.</p><p></p><p>"Young Master, what's wrong?" the maidservant next to him couldn't help but ask, concerned.</p><p></p><p>Ning Zhiyuan stared at Ye Xiao's retreating back. "I think I've seen that person before, he should be the librarian at the Martial Arts Library. What is he doing here?"</p><p></p><p>The maidservant glanced over and casually replied, "That's normal. This time, it's not just high-level martial artists who were afflicted, but also many ordinary civilians. Even though he's just a small librarian, maybe his relatives are sick here as well?"</p><p></p><p>Ning Zhiyuan nodded. "You're right. Let's go upstairs to see my uncle."</p><p></p><p>"Yes, Young Master."</p><p></p><p>Of course, Ye Xiao had heard everything they said. He had been worried about the materials, but now it seems that wouldn't be an issue.</p><p></p><p>In the Ning family manor, the newly built alchemy room was bustling with activity. Several great alchemists from the Xuanyuan Clan, along with their disciples, were working diligently to refine the medicinal pills.</p><p></p><p>"Pick up the pace, but don't compromise on quality. These are life-saving pills, we can't be careless. If we're too late and can't get the pills to those afflicted in time, all our efforts will be for naught."</p><p></p><p>A bearded alchemist master paced back and forth in the alchemy room, his expression extremely grave. As an expert of this level, he was well aware of the terrifying nature of the Blood Butterfly.</p><p></p><p>Although he had only learned the tip of the iceberg from ancient texts, even that small amount was enough to make him anxious and fearful. </p><p></p><p>This was because the Blood Butterfly not only harmed its current host, but would also create new hosts after contact. </p><p></p><p>That was the truly troublesome part. If it spread from one to ten, then ten to a hundred, and infected everyone here, it would be a complete disaster.</p><p></p><p>At this moment, he failed to notice a seemingly ordinary figure quietly slipping into the alchemy room.</p><p></p><p>The first batch of pills had just finished refining.</p><p></p><p>"Master Chen, the pills are ready."</p><p></p><p>"Quick, let me take a look!" </p><p></p><p>Master Chen immediately took the pills to inspect them. However, when he saw them, he couldn't help but be greatly disappointed.</p><p></p><p>Although the pills were refined quite well, there were still some flaws, not perfect enough.</p><p></p><p>And the Blood Butterfly had its own intelligence - even the slightest imperfection in the pills would prevent it from being easily fooled.</p><p></p><p>"Damn it! These pills won't work, we need to refine them again. The purity is not high enough, keep extending the refining time and put more effort into it!"</p><p></p><p>(End of chapter)</p>

        <h1>Chapter 114</h1>
        <div class="content">
            <p>Here is the full English translation of the Chinese excerpt:</p><p></p><p>Ye Xiao suspected that this "Returning to One" alchemy technique not only absorbed the energy, blood qi, and other nutritional substances together, but also slightly altered the taste, bringing out the good flavors within.</p><p></p><p>When the alchemy was being synthesized, he had already fallen asleep, so he did not see what the basic characters of the "Returning to One" alchemy method were. It was not easy to discern.</p><p></p><p>But it didn't matter, as long as the taste was good.</p><p></p><p>For a seasoned foodie, what could be more perfect than being able to obtain cultivation progress while also satisfying one's appetite? After swallowing the medicinal pill, all of Ye Xiao's cultivation techniques inside his body began to rapidly operate, crazily absorbing the surging spiritual energy from the pill and fusing it into Ye Xiao's seven meridians and eight vessels.</p><p></p><p>It was as if multiple rocket boosters had been triggered within him.</p><p></p><p>Tyrannical Blade! Severing Heaven Sword! Purple Veil Star Sea! Divine Will Technique! Indestructible Divine Skill!</p><p></p><p>Even the divine craftsmanship of alchemy and forging were driving a portion of the spiritual energy to flush through Ye Xiao's meridians.</p><p></p><p>Only the mental cultivation technique, the Supremely Mysterious Celestial Gale, did not activate, because that cultivated spiritual power, and it would only be triggered when spiritual power was supplemented.</p><p></p><p>Ye Xiao was extremely grateful that he had previously cultivated the Indestructible Divine Skill.</p><p></p><p>He had cultivated too many techniques, to the point that simultaneously operating them in his meridians would create immense pressure, akin to a power line that could only withstand 10,000 volts having to bear tens of thousands or even higher pulse pressures.</p><p></p><p>In the past, his meridians would have directly exploded, causing a lot of trouble. But now, he didn't need to worry about this problem, as the Indestructible Divine Skill had strengthened his physique and meridians, allowing him to fully withstand multiple powerful imperial arts carrying massive spiritual energy flowing within his body.</p><p></p><p>Under the driving force of so much spiritual energy, Ye Xiao's body soon erupted in a brilliant golden light, enveloping him.</p><p></p><p>Moreover, he also felt his cultivation undergo rapid changes.</p><p></p><p>Previously, he had already comprehended the Dao of the Innate Sixth Realm of the Martial Dao. Therefore, after receiving this spiritual energy supplement, he easily broke through to that level.</p><p></p><p>Boom!</p><p></p><p>Accompanied by a fluctuation in his dantian, Ye Xiao's cultivation finally broke through to the Innate Sixth Realm.</p><p></p><p>At this moment, he felt the immense power that could be unleashed within his body, a huge transformation from quantity to quality.</p><p></p><p>It was as if a sedentary, overweight, and physically inactive otaku had suddenly transformed into a fit, muscular, and explosive athlete! The power he could control and unleash had increased manifold, with even sharper mobilization ability.</p><p></p><p>In fact, when one's cultivation reached the Innate Fourth Realm of the Grand Master, the cultivator's cultivation and speed of mobilizing spiritual energy had already undergone a quantitative change compared to the Master Realm.</p><p></p><p>And in the process of breaking through from the Innate Fourth Realm to the Innate Sixth Realm, this was further optimized. The increase in quantity was accompanied by an enhancement in quality!</p><p></p><p>Additionally, within the Innate Realm, the development of the three Martial Dao Truths - from the individual, to friendship, to dignity and the heart of fighting for strength - had also elevated the cultivator's mindset from a somewhat selfish small person to a broader, greater realm.</p><p></p><p>This might be the reason why the Innate Realm is divided into the Master, Grand Master, and Divine Master realms - because each major realm has cultivated different</p><p></p><p>Here is the full English translation of the Chinese excerpt:</p><p></p><p>Time has its own unique developmental characteristics.</p><p></p><p>This also made Ye Xiao understand why there are still so many ordinary people in high positions in the world of martial artists.</p><p></p><p>On the one hand, true martial artists are often more inclined towards cultivation, and the more time they spend cultivating, the less time they have to deal with political affairs.</p><p></p><p>On the other hand, as martial artists gradually become stronger, their mentality also becomes stronger. They no longer desire power! Just imagine, with a single thought, you can annihilate countless experts, so why would you still care about power?</p><p></p><p>That's not a joke, right?</p><p></p><p>Cultivation itself is the greatest power! Of course, the strong will certainly not be so boring, because the vision of the strong is also higher.</p><p></p><p>You might say that a strong person may be indifferent to the life of an ant, but he would never go out of his way to kill an ant.</p><p></p><p>Because the other party poses no threat to him whatsoever!</p><p></p><p>This is the self-confidence of the strong!</p><p></p><p>Ye Xiao clenched his fists, and his knuckles cracked, not from the trembling of his bones and tendons, but from the bursting of the spiritual energy within him.</p><p></p><p>There was too much spiritual energy in his body.</p><p></p><p>The soil in the cellar began to gradually flatten out and gradually spread outwards, as if there was an invisible expansion machine compressing the surrounding soil.</p><p></p><p>With a thought, Ye Xiao's body instantly disappeared from the cellar and appeared in the vast sky.</p><p></p><p>Having just broken through, his power was too strong, and he needed to release some of it.</p><p></p><p>This was not something he could easily control, the power was truly too strong!</p><p></p><p>At this time, the clouds above the entire Jianghai City began to disperse and flow outwards.</p><p></p><p>In addition, a golden light was released in the sky, like a second sun appearing.</p><p></p><p>This miraculous sight attracted countless people to take photos and stare in curiosity.</p><p></p><p>In the City Lord's Mansion, Dou Chang'feng saw this scene and couldn't help but have his pupils constrict.</p><p></p><p>"Is there a senior expert breaking through?"</p><p></p><p>He took a deep breath and immediately stepped into the air, coming before the golden light.</p><p></p><p>"Junior Dou Chang'feng pays respects to the senior. The senior has been in Jianghai City for many days, and the junior has never seen the senior's true appearance. Today, I am honored to see the senior's countenance and have come to disturb you, please do not take offense."</p><p></p><p>Enveloped in the golden light, Ye Xiao did not need to worry about Dou Chang'feng seeing his appearance. He glanced at Dou Chang'feng and was surprised to find that he had suffered a serious injury.</p><p></p><p>Isn't this guy a Grand Master? How could someone have injured him?</p><p></p><p>Could there be other powerful experts above the Grand Master level in Jianghai City? Ye Xiao narrowed his eyes and directly used the Taixuan Tiangong to scan Dou Chang'feng's memories.</p><p></p><p>Dou Chang'feng's body trembled instantly. As a Grand Master expert, his spiritual power had also been cultivated, so he could vaguely feel Ye Xiao searching through his memories.</p><p></p><p>This made him even more shocked and amazed.</p><p></p><p>So powerful! This senior is incredibly formidable!</p><p></p><p>As a martial artist, cultivating spiritual power can only be an auxiliary, and few people focus on cultivating spiritual power, as that would be a waste of time.</p><p></p><p>But the senior before him, while possessing such powerful martial cultivation, had also cultivated such formidable spiritual power.</p><p></p><p>When he scanned Dou Chang'feng's memories, Dou Chang'feng's spiritual power couldn't even resist.</p><p></p><p>What an extraordinary technique!</p>

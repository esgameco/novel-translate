        <div class="content">
            <p>Here is the full English translation of the Chinese excerpt:</p><p></p><p>After hanging up the phone, Ye Xiao went out to have breakfast and then went to work.</p><p></p><p>"Boss, two spicy tofu buns, two radish vermicelli buns, and a cup of red bean porridge."</p><p></p><p>As soon as Ye Xiao arrived at the shop entrance, he saw a girl dressed in a black windbreaker, wearing a baseball cap and a mask, buying things in a stealthy manner.</p><p></p><p>But if it was just an ordinary girl, he wouldn't have bothered to notice her.</p><p></p><p>After cultivating to the Innate Ninth Rank, his six senses became terrifyingly strong, and with a single glance, he recognized her as Qin Yuyan.</p><p></p><p>What is this woman up to? Qin Yuyan turned around, and her gaze met Ye Xiao's. She paused for a moment, and the two fell into silence.</p><p></p><p>"You recognized that it was me?"</p><p></p><p>Qin Yuyan took off her sunglasses and smiled awkwardly.</p><p></p><p>"I didn't expect you to be able to recognize me even though I'm dressed so discreetly."</p><p></p><p>Ye Xiao was speechless. With that tight-fitting windbreaker and those two prominent melons, even if he wasn't an Innate Ninth Rank expert, someone who was a little familiar with her would be able to recognize her at a glance. At least she should have worn a looser windbreaker.</p><p></p><p>"Why are you dressed like this?"</p><p></p><p>"I can't expose my identity casually right now."</p><p></p><p>"I see."</p><p></p><p>After all, Qin Yuyan was of imperial bloodline, and in Jianghai City, she was practically a celebrity. Being exposed in public would easily attract attention and pursuit.</p><p></p><p>Ye Xiao bought a breakfast set, and the two walked and chatted.</p><p></p><p>"By the way, I heard that the library is going to be upgraded again, and all management staff below Fourth Rank will be dismissed?"</p><p></p><p>Ye Xiao nodded.</p><p></p><p>"You're currently at the Third Rank, right?"</p><p></p><p>"Yes."</p><p></p><p>"Without the awakening of your spiritual soul, it will be difficult for you to break through to the Fourth Rank. The essence of cultivation still requires the support of the spiritual soul, unless you have access to extremely powerful elixirs."</p><p></p><p>Qin Yuyan touched the ring on her hand, as she now had a spatial ring.</p><p></p><p>The next moment, a small porcelain bottle appeared in her palm.</p><p></p><p>"Here, this is a quasi-Grandmaster-level elixir, the Gathering Element Pill, containing powerful spiritual energy. If you use it, you should have a chance to break through to a higher cultivation level, and when you're close to a breakthrough, you may even have the opportunity to condense your spiritual soul."</p><p></p><p>Ye Xiao did not reach out to take it.</p><p></p><p>"It's fine, I won't take it. Grandmaster-level elixirs are very expensive."</p><p></p><p>"It's okay, they give me a lot of these elixirs every day, and I can't use them all up. I'll give you one to solve your urgent problem. Maybe if you become successful in the future, I can still benefit from it."</p><p></p><p>After saying that, she disregarded Ye Xiao's objections and stuffed the elixir into his pocket.</p><p></p><p>"I need to hurry back to cultivate, or my two mentors will be waiting for me too long. Goodbye."</p><p></p><p>Qin Yuyan waved and left. Ye Xiao took the elixir out of his pocket and smiled.</p><p></p><p>This Qin Yuyan, although her talent is not that great, her character is still quite good.</p><p></p><p>With this elixir, he could also cover up a lie.</p><p></p><p>Soon, Ye Xiao arrived at the library. As soon as he reached the library entrance, he saw Fa Zheng leading another monk there.</p><p></p><p>"Ye Shishi."</p><p></p><p>Ye Xiao glanced at him and then at the other monk, immediately recognizing his identity.</p><p></p><p>It was most likely that Tian Zhu monk, Aro.</p><p></p><p>"Great Master Fa Zheng."</p><p></p><p>"Ye Shishi, let me introduce you. This is the Tian Zhu monk Aro, who has also chosen to stay in our Jianghai City and prepare to study the Buddhist Dharma here.</p><p></p><p>Aro, this is Ye Xiao, Ye Shishi, a good friend of mine."</p><p></p><p>Aro nodded and made a gesture of respect.</p><p></p><p>"Ye Shishi."</p><p></p><p>Ye Xiao greeted him.</p><p></p><p>Fa Zheng then spoke:</p><p></p><p>"Ye Shishi, I just heard that the library is going to be upgraded, and cultivators below the Fourth Rank may be transferred and unable to continue serving as management staff?"</p><p></p><p>Ye Xiao nodded.</p><p></p><p>"I didn't expect you to know about this too."</p><p></p><p>"It seems this is indeed the case."</p><p></p><p>Fa Zheng took out a small porcelain bottle from his sleeve.</p><p></p><p>"The Shaolin side, in order to help me expand the Shaolin Institute here, has provided me with some resources, and there happen to be a few Condensing Spirit Pills. I'll give you one."</p><p></p><p>After a pause, he added, "Don't worry, this is me giving it to you as a friend, not forcing you to join Shaolin."</p><p></p><p>"How can I accept this?"</p><p></p><p>"It's fine, I still have some left. If you feel guilty about it, you can introduce a few more talented disciples to me in the future."</p><p></p><p>Fa Zheng jokingly placed the pill in Ye Xiao's pocket, then led Aro into the library to search for books related to Buddhism.</p><p></p><p>Ye Xiao felt warmth in his heart.</p><p></p><p>Unknowingly, he had already made so many friends.</p><p></p><p>When they knew he was in difficulty, they all took the initiative to help and provide assistance, without even waiting for him to ask.</p><p></p><p>Although he didn't need it, they didn't know that. The things they gave him were good things even for an ordinary person.</p><p></p><p>With so many true friends, the times he had stepped forward to protect Jianghai City were worth it.</p><p></p><p>By the time Ye Xiao arrived on the fourth floor, it wasn't long before Liu Chengxun also came over.</p><p></p><p>"Ye Xiao. Did you receive my message yesterday?"</p><p></p><p>Ye Xiao nodded.</p><p></p><p>"Your current cultivation level is a bit low. I'm afraid you won't be able to pass this test."</p><p></p><p>Here is the full English translation of the Chinese novel excerpt:</p><p></p><p>"I have a few elixirs here. Take them and see if you can make a breakthrough?" </p><p></p><p>Even Liuxing Xun came to help me.</p><p></p><p>"I'm so sorry to trouble you."</p><p></p><p>"Don't be polite. I have plenty of these elixirs. In the Nine Provinces, besides my disciple Jian Sheng, you're the only good friend I have. If you get fired from the library, I'll be so bored without you.</p><p></p><p>Just think of it as me helping you improve your cultivation so you can stay and keep me company."</p><p></p><p>"Then I won't decline your kindness."</p><p></p><p>Liuxing Xun nodded.</p><p></p><p>"I have some other matters to attend to, so I'll head back first. You quickly take the elixirs and improve your cultivation."</p><p></p><p>"Okay."</p><p></p><p>Ye Xiao looked at the several bottles of elixirs in his hand, as well as the ones in his pocket. With so many elixirs, he felt a mix of emotions and a slight sense of gratitude.</p><p></p><p>He had originally planned to make up an excuse, saying he had saved up to buy the elixirs himself and had broken through to the late Heavenly Fourth Rank.</p><p></p><p>However, with so many people helping him now, he might as well set his sights a bit higher this time, to prevent having to report his cultivation again if the library were to upgrade in the future.</p><p></p><p>Hmm, how high should he set it?</p><p></p><p>He'll just say he's reached the late Heavenly Sixth Rank.</p><p></p><p>After all, they've given him so many elixirs, being able to break through three small Heavenly Ranks is still plausible.</p><p></p><p>This way, he won't have to worry about explaining his cultivation and can focus on reading.</p><p></p><p>The rest, he'll deal with when the library upgrades and arranges for the Imperial Arts to be taught. He'll learn those Imperial Arts and wait until his cultivation reaches the King Realm.</p><p></p><p>Then he can directly cultivate the Imperial Arts.</p><p></p><p>Perfect.</p><p></p><p>Over the entire day, Ye Xiao finally found the last Claw Technique, a skill called the Soul-Locking Claw.</p><p></p><p>After mastering this technique, Ye Xiao would be able to synthesize another Imperial Art.</p><p></p><p>He imprinted it onto the Golden Book's spiritual consciousness, letting the book cultivate it, and he'll refine it when he returns home in the evening.</p><p></p><p>Afterwards, he began searching for information related to advancing to the King Realm and information about eye techniques.</p><p></p><p>Ever since he witnessed Xia Bingning's eye technique, he had been very interested in it.</p><p></p><p>He could feel that eye techniques were actually a much stronger power than all of his current techniques.</p><p></p><p>It's just that because Xia Bingning's strength was not enough, she couldn't fully unleash the power of the eye technique.</p><p></p><p>Even so, Xia Bingning could still defeat two opponents of the same rank, which was already a very impressive feat.</p><p></p><p>If he could cultivate it himself, the effects would probably be even better.</p><p></p><p>Unfortunately, Ye Xiao couldn't find any information about eye techniques.</p><p></p><p>This shows that the level of eye techniques truly surpasses the techniques of this world.</p><p></p><p>Fortunately, while he couldn't find information about eye techniques, he did find some information about the King Realm.</p><p></p><p>But it was very obscure.</p><p></p><p>The Nine Provinces seemed to be intentionally concealing something.</p><p></p><p>In this world, there is some secrecy surrounding Sage Realm experts. Even the Nine Provinces, which clearly has many Sage Realm experts, only openly acknowledges two or three dozen.</p><p></p><p>It's unknown why they are hiding this.</p><p></p><p>The information about the King Realm that Ye Xiao found was from the books donated by the Shaolin Monastery.</p><p></p><p>These books said that the three Grandmaster realms represent the pinnacle of physical body cultivation for humans.</p><p></p><p>When one completely transcends the three Grandmaster realms and can cultivate their spiritual power to an unprecedented level, fusing it completely with their physical body to create a brand new form of life, they can become a legendary King Realm expert.</p><p></p><p>As is well known, the soul and physical body, although fused together, still exist independently.</p><p></p><p>When the physical body perishes, the soul may not necessarily be extinguished, and when the soul perishes, the physical body can still exist for a time.</p><p></p><p>The two are complementary, like the relationship between skin and flesh - one provides protection, the other provides the body's driving force.</p><p></p><p>The soul and physical body, one provides power, the other controls that power.</p><p></p><p>Completely fusing the physical body and soul is also to solve a common problem of the human race.</p><p></p><p>That is, the mismatch between the physical body and the soul.</p><p></p><p>As cultivation continuously increases, the soul's control over the physical body becomes weaker and weaker. If the soul is not strengthened, it will result in power becoming too great, and the soul will gradually lose control of the physical body, leading to deviation.</p><p></p><p>This is the easiest mistake for many Sage Realm experts on the verge of breaking through to the King Realm.</p><p></p><p>Many have fallen at this juncture.</p><p></p><p>Like Ye Xiao now, his physical body strength is already very powerful, but his spiritual consciousness sometimes can't keep up, causing him to take several days to fully adapt to the increase in power each time he breaks through. </p><p></p><p>It's still manageable at the Grandmaster Realm, but becomes especially evident at the Sage Realm.</p><p></p><p>As for the power above the King Realm, it would be even more overwhelming, making one completely at a loss. Without an extremely powerful spiritual consciousness, even if one breaks through to the King Realm, they may still deviate due to an inability to control the power.</p>

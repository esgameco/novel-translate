        <h1>Chapter 52</h1>
        <div class="content">
            <p>Here is the full English translation of the Chinese excerpt:</p><p></p><p>At this moment, a group of unfamiliar guests arrived.</p><p></p><p>"Mr. Zhao, welcome, welcome."</p><p></p><p>Dou Tianyü, the current city lord of Jianghai City, along with his secretary and the city's administrative team, had been waiting here early.</p><p></p><p>Dou Tianyü is a descendant of the prominent Dou family in Jianghai City, and Dou Changfeng is his paternal uncle.</p><p></p><p>His cultivation level is not particularly high, but in managing the city administration, he relies on his intelligence, vision, and decisiveness in decision-making, rather than high cultivation.</p><p></p><p>Of course, the main reason is that the land of the Nine Provinces is vast, with numerous cities, and the Nine Provinces simply cannot provide every city with a city lord of high cultivation.</p><p></p><p>The truly powerful ones are mostly deployed to the frontlines.</p><p></p><p>Only the positions of the Dean of the Martial Arts Academy, the Librarian, and the Commander-in-Chief of the Garrison are reserved for masters-level experts.</p><p></p><p>Strictly speaking, this is the general situation throughout the world.</p><p></p><p>After all, top-tier experts are truly rare, and if social status were solely determined by the level of martial prowess, it would directly lead to the collapse of morality and an extremely unequal society of the strong devouring the weak, causing humanity to drift ever closer to destruction.</p><p></p><p>"City Lord Dou, we have come here this time with the expectations of the Nine Provinces Alliance Headquarters. No matter what, we must develop Jianghai City into a high-level city."</p><p></p><p>The joy on City Lord Dou's face was impossible to conceal.</p><p></p><p>"We in Jianghai City have been waiting for this day for a long time."</p><p></p><p>"Regarding the detailed plan, let's discuss it inside."</p><p></p><p>"Okay, okay, please come in, please come in."</p><p></p><p>The group entered the city lord's mansion and discussed for a full two hours, and the entire meeting finally concluded, with the development direction for Jianghai City confirmed.</p><p></p><p>After the meeting, everyone dispersed, following the instructions to start drafting the development plan for Jianghai City.</p><p></p><p>In the spacious meeting room, only Mr. Zhao and City Lord Dou remained.</p><p></p><p>Mr. Zhao took off his gold-rimmed glasses, casually wiping them while glancing at City Lord Dou, and then spoke with a smile:</p><p></p><p>"Actually, before I came, the Headquarters also had a private task for me to deliver to you."</p><p></p><p>City Lord Dou was startled, and his expression immediately turned serious. "Mr. Zhao, please go ahead."</p><p></p><p>"A few months ago, there have been rumors in Jianghai City about two powerful experts whose cultivation is likely at the Grand Master level. I wonder if you know about this?"</p><p></p><p>City Lord Dou nodded.</p><p></p><p>"This is common knowledge in Jianghai City, so of course I know about it."</p><p></p><p>"The Headquarters' requirement is to find out the identities of these two individuals.</p><p></p><p>You know that in the land of the Nine Provinces, no force outside the Alliance's control is allowed to exist.</p><p></p><p>Of course, it would be best if they could be recruited into the Alliance to serve the Nine Provinces."</p><p></p><p>City Lord Dou was somewhat troubled. These free-spirited experts are usually unwilling to be constrained by the system.</p><p></p><p>If they wanted to join the Alliance, they would have done so long ago.</p><p></p><p>But since they have not appeared, it means they are not interested in power and position.</p><p></p><p>If he were to go find them, what if they refuse? Wouldn't that be imposing on them unnecessarily? And they have even saved Jianghai City a few times. If he does this, wouldn't it be...</p><p></p><p>"Mr. Zhao, this matter may be a bit difficult. First, their strength is too great, like the elusive dragon, and my people really can't find them easily.</p><p></p><p>Secondly, if it weren't for them, Jianghai City might have suffered even greater harm, so they can be considered benefactors of the city. I..."</p><p></p><p>"Dou Tianyü!"</p><p></p><p>Before City Lord Dou could finish, the other party had already interrupted him.</p><p></p><p>"Don't forget that you are the city lord of the Alliance! With your public office, discussing jianghu matters..."</p><p></p><p>Here is the full English translation of the Chinese excerpt:</p><p></p><p>"Personal feelings are a grave taboo. The first thing you must think about is the interests of the alliance!" </p><p></p><p>Dou Tianyü's heart trembled, and in the end he could only reluctantly lower his head.</p><p></p><p>"Yes." Seeing Dou Tianyü yield, Mr. Zhao's tone also softened a bit.</p><p></p><p>"City Lord Dou, I'm also thinking of them. Since they have such powerful strength, they should naturally contribute to the Nine Provinces. </p><p></p><p>In recent years, the situation on the frontlines has been tight. If we can have a couple more major sects, it will be a great help.</p><p></p><p>If they are willing to lend a hand, the Nine Provinces will naturally not let them down either. </p><p></p><p>Wealth, power, women - whatever riches in the world they want, they shall have.</p><p></p><p>This is a win-win situation for them, and for everyone."</p><p></p><p>"I understand."</p><p></p><p>"I'm glad you can understand. Furthermore, the case of the library theft is also highly valued above. The map of King Aier is of great importance, so this case must be thoroughly investigated to get to the bottom of it.</p><p></p><p>That missing Yang Zhengyi is strongly suspected of being the culprit. Following his trail, thoroughly investigate the entire library to recover King Aier's map."</p><p></p><p>"Understood."</p><p></p><p>On Ye Xiao's side, he directed the workers to sort the books, busy for half a day before finally getting the books organized.</p><p></p><p>These books were not all new, some were newly purchased by the library, while others were donated from other regional libraries.</p><p></p><p>In this way, Ye Xiao now had many new books to read.</p><p></p><p>Although he was still on the third floor, due to the library expansion, the area he managed was now as large as the entire original three floors.</p><p></p><p>Ning Yühen followed him, acting as a small manager.</p><p></p><p>This kid, although... hmm... a bit hard to distinguish the gender, was still quite good and quite diligent.</p><p></p><p>Ye Xiao arranged everything for him to do, becoming a hands-off boss, comfortably reading books and living a pleasant life.</p><p></p><p>And he was increasingly able to understand the benefits that power brings.</p><p></p><p>It's like countless invisible hands and feet - you only need to move your lips, and many things can be done for you.</p><p></p><p>This is somewhat similar to spiritual cultivation techniques, but the difference is that spiritual techniques still consume one's spiritual power.</p><p></p><p>Power, on the other hand, allows you to reign over others, with an inexplicable sense of control.</p><p></p><p>Even if Ye Xiao doesn't bully people, others will still want to flatter and please him, actively doing things for him - this is the charm of power.</p><p></p><p>After reading for two days, Ye Xiao also collected two more basic healing techniques.</p><p></p><p>In this way, he has now reached nine basic healing techniques.</p><p></p><p>In the Golden Book of the Divine Soul, the nine pages imprinted with healing techniques are starting to faintly emit a golden glow.</p><p></p><p>This means that with one more basic healing technique, he will be able to fuse a top-tier healing technique.</p><p></p><p>Estimating, even if he's beaten to the point of broken arms and legs, with a gaping hole in his chest, as long as he has a breath left, he'll be able to quickly heal his injuries.</p><p></p><p>It's practically like having an immortality cheat? And it's free with unlimited duration! Just thinking about it makes him happy.</p><p></p><p>However, just as he was reading, a large hand suddenly slapped down on his shoulder.</p><p></p><p>"Old Ye, you've been promoted, and you're still reading books?"</p><p></p><p>This is the end of the chapter. I hope this full translation is helpful!</p>

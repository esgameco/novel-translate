        <h1>Chapter 2</h1>
        <div class="content">
            <p>Here is the full English translation of the Chinese excerpt:</p><p></p><p>Ye Xiao didn't expect that during the time he was just having a meal, he had actually broken through? This seemed a bit perfunctory.</p><p></p><p>After all, it might have taken others many years to break through a small realm.</p><p></p><p>But he only took half a day.</p><p></p><p>He communicated with his spiritual consciousness again and saw that the first page's Minglu Blade Technique had already been cultivated to great perfection, the progress bar disappeared, and the pages recording the technique had turned golden.</p><p></p><p>This meant that from now on, his mastery of the Minglu Blade Technique would be close to perfection.</p><p></p><p>Minglu Blade Technique was the name of the blade technique that Ye Xiao had seen, but in fact, it was also a technique that had been plagiarized, its origin being the basic sword-drawing technique!</p><p></p><p>"I don't know how powerful the Minglu Blade Technique is, but I must find a place without people during the weekend to try it out."</p><p></p><p>He casually glanced at the back, and the second page's Chen Family Blade had already been cultivated to 87% progress.</p><p></p><p>The third page's Qingfeng Sword Technique and the fourth page's Iron Family Fist had both been cultivated to 80% progress.</p><p></p><p>The origin of the Chen Family Blade was the Chopping Blade Technique!</p><p></p><p>The origin of the Qingfeng Sword Technique was the Slashing Sword Technique!</p><p></p><p>The origin of the Iron Family Fist was the Straight Fist!</p><p></p><p>The authors of these basic techniques probably had a low level of culture, and the naming was perfunctory, either using their own names or their family names to name them.</p><p></p><p>But well, since they were all plagiarized and adapted techniques, what high-end names could one expect? Hopefully, when they were fused later, some more pleasant-sounding names could be produced, after all, Ye Xiao was still a somewhat cultured young man with a national style.</p><p></p><p>Not too chuuni, can he still be called a young man? After finishing lunch, Ye Xiao returned to his management area and began to read again.</p><p></p><p>It's not that he was in a hurry to break through, it's just that in his previous life, he had been bedridden for too long, and in this life, he was rather averse to lying in bed and daydreaming.</p><p></p><p>The afternoon passed in a flash, and this time Ye Xiao read forty books!</p><p></p><p>Unfortunately, only five of them were techniques, three of which were blade techniques and two were sword techniques, the rest were all of the same origin, just with different names and a few different moves, and could not be recorded in the Golden Book.</p><p></p><p>This made Ye Xiao sigh involuntarily, the martial artists who studied techniques were really too inward-looking.</p><p></p><p>You write a technique, and others immediately plagiarize and adapt it into a hundred different techniques, earning more money and gaining more fame than you, and it's not even illegal, you tell me, isn't that frustrating? Fortunately, Ye Xiao's personality was more Buddhist, without excessive pursuit of cultivation, so he naturally didn't get angry.</p><p></p><p>When he had had enough, he would switch to history, geography, and other such books to rest his mind.</p><p></p><p>The history of this world was more or less the same as his previous life, with the dynasties matching up, but there were some differences.</p><p></p><p>One was that in the historical dynasties, they were all based on family clans, cultivating to the peak, and unifying the nine states.</p><p></p><p>In each dynasty, there would always be a few heavenly prodigies who cultivated to a level beyond ordinary people.</p><p></p><p>For example, the Three Sovereigns and Five Emperors, or Qin Shi Huang and Han Wudi, Tang Taizong and Song Taizu.</p><p></p><p>Among their ministers, there were also powerful martial artists, such as Wang Jian, Bai Qi, Guan Gong, and Qin Qiong.</p><p></p><p>The other was that for some unknown reason, these people would always disappear in the end, and then be swallowed up by the rising strong ones of the new clan, who would establish a new dynasty.</p><p></p><p>It seems to be the same abroad.</p><p></p><p>So this led to the fact that the current situation of this world and Earth was more or less the same, the historical events that should have happened basically all happened, just with some special differences.</p><p></p><p>For example, many famous people in his previous life were powerful martial artists in this world! Or some of the extremely bloody battles in history might have been changed to martial artists dueling, or joining forces to defend the human homeland and resist the invasion of the Star Beasts, rather than the so-called airplanes and cannons.</p><p></p><p>Thinking about it, it makes sense, after all, when humans cultivate to the extreme, flying in the sky...</p><p></p><p>Here is the full English translation of the Chinese excerpt:</p><p></p><p>To hide underground, to control mountains and rivers, what need is there for airplanes and cannons? One sword can slay enemies hundreds of miles away, and a hundred kilometers can be traversed with just two bowls of rice - isn't that wonderful?</p><p></p><p>And as for airplanes and cannons, they generally can't even break through the defensive aura of top-tier martial artists! As for the star beasts, they are a type of spiritual beast from the cosmos, different from ordinary wild beasts. They possess combat abilities akin to human cultivators, which can be considered extraordinary powers. Some powerful star beasts can even easily destroy an entire country. However, just like the mysterious disappearances of powerful figures throughout history, the origins of these star beasts remain unexplained.</p><p></p><p>Ye Xiao estimates that this information likely involves core secrets, and he should be able to find more by inquiring at the higher levels of the library.</p><p></p><p>Unfortunately, the higher levels are not accessible to ordinary people, as they are guarded by experts.</p><p></p><p>"Dong~!"</p><p></p><p>At this moment, the sound of the work bell rings out again. Ye Xiao closes his book, stretches, and heads off to the cafeteria to have a meal.</p><p></p><p>While he can be carefree about everything else, when it comes to eating, he cannot be carefree at all.</p><p></p><p>Because for other matters, not doing them won't lead to death, but doing them might. </p><p></p><p>But with eating, if he doesn't eat, he will truly starve to death!</p><p></p><p>And so, day after day, Ye Xiao's routine is the same - reading books, eating meals, and moving between the management area, the cafeteria, and the dormitory.</p><p></p><p>After half a year, he finally broke through to the peak of the Ninth Realm of martial artists, reaching the pinnacle of Ninth Realm power!</p><p></p><p>He is just a hair's breadth away from stepping into the legendary Innate Realm.</p><p></p><p>At that time, he will become a true master.</p><p></p><p>It is said that after becoming a master, he will be qualified to open his own academy.</p><p></p><p>Of course, becoming a master brings benefits far beyond just opening an academy - the advantages are too numerous to count.</p><p></p><p>To put it simply, in this world, becoming a master means becoming superior among the superior.</p><p></p><p>If he were to shout on the street, "I am a master now!", the people lining up to fawn over him would likely circle the entire city twice.</p><p></p><p>Even without reaching mastery, just being a Ninth Realm martial artist like Ye Xiao is highly sought-after. Outside companies, private families, and even the military would offer him extremely high salaries to recruit him.</p><p></p><p>The conditions and treatment would be far beyond what a humble library manager could ever hope for. But Ye Xiao has no intention of changing careers.</p><p></p><p>Firstly, he is not interested in making money. Having experienced life and death, he is content as long as he can live peacefully in a corner.</p><p></p><p>Secondly, after reading so many books, he is aware that the outside world is very dangerous, far less tranquil than the days he spends in the library.</p><p></p><p>Although he has reached the Ninth Realm, there are still those beyond him, "people above people, heavens above heavens." If he were to encounter an Innate Realm expert, it would be a dead end.</p><p></p><p>The third and most important reason is that while others need to rely on elixirs and cultivation resources to improve their cultivation, he can simply read books and imprint the techniques directly into his spiritual sea, allowing him to cultivate effortlessly.</p><p></p><p>Compared to that, staying in the library is truly the best choice for him.</p><p></p><p>Over the past half year, Ye Xiao has also become quite familiar with his colleagues at the library. His gentle temperament and good looks have made him particularly popular, especially with the female staff.</p><p></p><p>"Dong~!"</p><p></p><p>The work bell rings out again. Before Ye Xiao can even close his book, a figure comes dashing up the stairs.</p><p></p><p>"Old Ye, it's time to eat!"</p>

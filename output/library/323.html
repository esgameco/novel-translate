        <h1>Chapter 323</h1>
        <div class="content">
            <p>Here is the full English translation of the Chinese excerpt:</p><p></p><p>They thought that Ye Xiao had asked them to withdraw because he was concerned for their safety, but they never expected that it was actually because Ye Xiao was afraid of holding back his full strength. This was really quite embarrassing for them.</p><p></p><p>However, this also made the crowd feel a sense of relief.</p><p></p><p>Having Ye Xiao, such an extraordinary genius and super powerhouse, was truly a blessing for the entire Jiuzhou!</p><p></p><p>At this time, more and more figures were gradually approaching from the distance - these were other powerful experts from Jiuzhou.</p><p></p><p>Among them were Divine Patriarchs and Grand Masters.</p><p></p><p>Even further away, there were also some Patriarch-level martial artists.</p><p></p><p>They had all sensed the tremendous aura here and wanted to come and see what was happening.</p><p></p><p>There were even some people who were taking long-distance videos with their phones.</p><p></p><p>North Tangce, who possessed the Demonic Fire Spirit Eyes, immediately noticed these people's movements.</p><p></p><p>He couldn't help but raise his eyebrows slightly.</p><p></p><p>"Ye Xiao doesn't like too many people knowing his identity. Should we help shield him?"</p><p></p><p>Qinglong shook his head.</p><p></p><p>"Letting the people of Jiuzhou know about Ye Xiao's strength can also be a good thing. After all, the realms across the world have all fallen, and the people's confidence has reached an unprecedented low. Although Jiuzhou has protective formations, their hearts are still filled with fear.</p><p></p><p>If Ye Xiao can take action and boost their faith, it will be a good thing for the entire Jiuzhou."</p><p></p><p>"But what about his identity?"</p><p></p><p>"I'll let Ye Xiao know."</p><p></p><p>With that, Qinglong used his spiritual power to transmit a thought to Ye Xiao, reminding him to pay attention to his facial features.</p><p></p><p>Ye Xiao sensed Qinglong's intention and didn't refuse, directly using a disguise technique to blur his facial features, making it difficult for others to see his true face clearly.</p><p></p><p>The human martial artists in the back couldn't help but speak up:</p><p></p><p>"What's going on up front? How did a gap appear in the formation?"</p><p></p><p>A Divine Patriarch slowly spoke:</p><p></p><p>"I seem to remember from an ancient text that the Great Wall of a Thousand Li has an opening, which is where the beginning and end connect. That place is known as the Gate of Jiuzhou! The Gate is not covered by the formation."</p><p></p><p>"My goodness, does that mean that person is guarding the Gate?"</p><p></p><p>"It's most likely the case. Do you see those few people behind him? Among them are Sword God Li Liushui, Sword Saint Lu Qingshan, and the Demonic Fire Spirit Eyes North Tangce from the Central State. They are all top experts on the Dragon Ranking."</p><p></p><p>"What about them? Look at the ones next to them - those are the Four Great Venerated Ones of Jiuzhou! The Four Great Venerated Ones, do you know? They occupy the top two spots on the World Dragon Ranking and the top two spots on the Phoenix Ranking."</p><p></p><p>"Whoa, this lineup is too luxurious! But why aren't they going up to join the battle?"</p><p></p><p>"You're an idiot? It's obvious they are there because of that person."</p><p></p><p>"The Gate is guarded by just one person? Is that even possible? He's that strong? Who is he? Why have I never seen him before?"</p><p></p><p>Some of the viewers watching the live stream couldn't help but speak up:</p><p></p><p>"Who else could it be? It has to be the Sword and Knife Immortal from Jianghai City!</p><p></p><p>Previously, he destroyed nearly a thousand spiritual ships in the sky with a single sword strike in Jianghai City. His might is simply unbelievable. In the entire Jiuzhou, perhaps only he could have the Four Venerated Ones, along with the Sword God and Sword Saint, guarding behind him."</p><p></p><p>"Is the Sword and Knife Immortal so strong that he has already reached the Martial Emperor realm?"</p><p></p><p>"Can't say for sure, but the fact that he alone is guarding the Gate means his strength is definitely not low!"</p><p></p><p>"Damn it, I can't get a clear shot of his face. I wonder if he's handsome enough to make me swoon."</p><p></p><p>"Why aren't those Four Venerated Ones going up with him? Leaving the Sword and Knife Immortal senior to hold the fort all by himself, isn't that too much?"</p><p></p><p>Lu Wanwan and Gu Hai were also watching the video while holding their child. The child was crying a bit, so Lu Wanwan quickly lifted her shirt to breastfeed her. As she glanced at the screen, she couldn't help but ask in puzzlement:</p><p></p><p>"Hmm, how strange. Honey, look at that guy's back, doesn't it look a lot like someone we know? It seems to be... Ye Xiao?"</p><p></p><p>"Who?"</p><p></p><p>"Ye Xiao, your good friend. Don't you remember?"</p><p></p><p>Gu Hai also took a quick look, and his heart skipped a beat.</p><p></p><p>Now that he looked closely, the figure did resemble Ye Xiao's back - calm and lonely.</p><p></p><p>"It can't be, right? How old is Ye Xiao? He couldn't possibly be that level of powerhouse. You must be mistaken."</p><p></p><p>"I'm sure I'm not wrong. Call Ye Xiao and check."</p><p></p><p>"Okay, my phone is in the bathroom. I'll go call him."</p><p></p><p>Saying that, Gu Hai immediately ran to the bathroom and dialed Ye Xiao's number.</p><p></p><p>At the same time, his eyes were still fixed on the screen, watching the figure that looked like Ye Xiao.</p><p></p><p>Just then, he suddenly saw the figure on the screen move its hand slightly, putting it in its pocket and then taking it out again.</p><p></p><p>And his phone was already showing that the other party was busy, please call back later.</p><p></p><p>In that moment, Gu Hai's eyes instantly reddened, and tears of excitement began to well up.</p><p></p><p>He was now almost 100% certain that the world-famous Sword and Knife Immortal was his good friend, Ye Xiao.</p><p></p><p>Here is the full English translation of the Chinese excerpt:</p><p></p><p>"My dear friend, Ye Xiao!" This little rascal, he's so powerful, but he didn't even tell me!</p><p></p><p>At that moment, Lu Wanwan called out from the bedroom, "Gu Hai, have you made the call? Is that really Ye Xiao?"</p><p></p><p>"Ah? No, it's not Ye Xiao, I'm still on the phone with Ye Xiao." Gu Hai muttered to the empty air, "Old Ye, it's nothing serious, it's just that Wanwan insists you are the Sword Immortal, I've already told her you're not the Sword Immortal, but she still doesn't believe me and wants me to call you.</p><p></p><p>Alright, it's settled then, I'll hang up now and go watch the live stream. Come to my place when you have time, we'll have a couple drinks together."</p><p></p><p>After saying that, Gu Hai put away his phone.</p><p></p><p>Ye Xiao, although I don't know why you don't want to reveal your identity, you must have your reasons.</p><p></p><p>As your good brother, I'm trash when it comes to cultivation, I can't be of much help to you, but at least I can help keep your identity hidden.</p><p></p><p>At this time, in front of the national border, as far as the eye could see, there were already some star beasts quickly gathering this way.</p><p></p><p>Seeing the endless sea of star beasts, countless netizens couldn't help but feel their hearts pounding, including the cultivators on the scene.</p><p></p><p>The cultivators responsible for filming could only choose to retreat, because if they got too close, the spiritual energy fluctuations would create a special magnetic field, rendering their electronic devices unusable.</p><p></p><p>In order to film clearly, they could only use various high-end props, such as telescopes.</p><p></p><p>Suddenly, the prices of telescopes were driven up, and some people even gouged the prices, selling them at exorbitant rates.</p><p></p><p>The star beasts gathered together, their speed becoming faster and faster.</p><p></p><p>So everyone stared fixatedly at this scene, their heartbeats quickening, wondering what kind of techniques Ye Xiao would use.</p><p></p><p>After all, these star beasts numbered in the millions!</p><p></p><p>Due to their sheer numbers and immense strength, the ground began to tremble as they charged forward, just like the trembling hearts of the people.</p><p></p><p>The star beasts had already approached Ye Xiao, less than a hundred li away, then ninety li, eighty li, seventy li, thirty li, twenty li, ten li! "Senior Sword Immortal, why hasn't he made a move yet? If he doesn't act soon, the enemy will be upon him!"</p><p></p><p>"If they get too close, that'll be trouble."</p><p></p><p>The people were already panicking more than Ye Xiao.</p><p></p><p>However, in the next moment, Ye Xiao finally made his move.</p><p></p><p>Heaven-Cleaving! A single sword strike unleashed a light beam that extended for millions of zhang, and before the sky and earth could change color, it had already descended upon the charging horde of star beasts.</p><p></p><p>Boom! A thunderous explosion erupted, followed by dazzling light. Under the massive light sphere, all living beings were unable to escape, all swept into it.</p><p></p><p>Everyone felt their eyes become completely blinded, as if they could see nothing.</p><p></p><p>"My goodness, the light is so intense, I can't even see clearly anymore."</p><p>"It's too bright, my dog eyes are going to go blind."</p><p></p><p>The light lasted for dozens of seconds before finally dissipating.</p><p></p><p>When the result was revealed before the crowd, everyone was instantly petrified.</p><p></p><p>No one spoke a word, even the online trolls fell silent at this moment.</p><p></p><p>There was no helping it - Ye Xiao was too powerful! Powerful to the point of defying the heavens, powerful to the point of shattering their worldviews.</p><p></p><p>With a single move, hundreds of millions of star beasts were simply gone.</p><p></p><p>In front of Ye Xiao, the massive horde of star beasts that had just surged forward, as numerous as ants, had now disappeared completely.</p><p></p><p>Those star beasts, though just the appetizer, were still star beasts after all!</p><p>There was no way there weren't any Saint Monarch experts among them.</p><p></p><p>But in Ye Xiao's hands, they couldn't even land a single strike! Hundreds of millions of star beasts!</p><p></p><p>This immense gap was simply chilling.</p><p></p><p>But after the shock, the crowd quickly became excited again.</p><p></p><p>The reason was simple - the one who acted was a human! It was Senior Sword Immortal.</p><p></p><p>If it had been the star beasts, they probably would have been in tears.</p><p></p><p>"Well done!"</p><p>"Senior Sword Immortal, you're the best!"</p><p>"Senior Sword Immortal, keep going! Annihilate those beasts, one by one."</p><p></p><p>At this time, whether it was the netizens on the screens or the cultivators on the scene, they were all wildly cheering for Ye Xiao from afar.</p><p></p><p>And amid their cheers, the second wave of star beasts began to approach.</p><p>This wave was even more powerful and numerous than the previous one!</p><p></p><p>Gu Hai, while changing his daughter's diaper, kept his eyes glued to the screen, silently cheering for Ye Xiao in his heart.</p><p></p><p>"Ye Xiao, keep it up!"</p><p></p><p>The next moment, Lu Wanwan delivered a resounding slap to the side of his head.</p><p></p><p>"Can you pay attention? Are you using the right diapers for our daughter? That's the Seven Realms brand I just bought!"</p><p></p><p>Six updates, 18,000 words.</p><p>Please recommend and vote for me.</p><p>Thank you to the readers Small Cloud 2333, Invincible Big White White, and Simple Simple for your donations, I'm deeply grateful.</p><p>I'm really not doing well today, so I'll end it here.</p><p>(Chapter end)</p>

        <h1>Chapter 187</h1>
        <div class="content">
            <p>Here is the full English translation of the Chinese excerpt:</p><p></p><p>"A few days ago, a descendant of the imperial bloodline of the human race appeared, and this should be the place, right?"</p><p></p><p>"The beast calamity is imminent, and we cannot allow the appearance of this imperial bloodline. The imperial bloodline is fraught with too many variables. Who knows how powerful she will become after four years of cultivation? If she becomes a Realm of the King expert, that would be a huge problem for our carefully prepared plan."</p><p></p><p>"What do we have to fear? Today, the three of us are all innate eighth-rank star beasts. We will come and capture her, and it will be easy prey.</p><p></p><p>As long as we bring her back to the Starry Sky, let the Tiger God devour her fortune and bloodline, she will not only fail to become the savior of humanity, but will also become a disaster for the human race, helping the Tiger God to break through further."</p><p></p><p>"Be careful, the human race may have arranged some Saint Monarch-level experts to protect her.</p><p></p><p>And they will definitely conceal her aura. Before finding her, we must all shield our auras well, so that the humans do not discover us and alert them.</p><p></p><p>Once we find her, immediately take her back to the Starry Sky formation, without the slightest delay."</p><p></p><p>"Yes!"</p><p></p><p>On Ye Xiao's side, after finishing dinner, he immediately returned home.</p><p></p><p>At this moment, the Formless Calamity Finger had been completely cultivated.</p><p></p><p>He could now proceed with the synthesis.</p><p></p><p>Seeing him return, Huan Liuli immediately came forward to greet him.</p><p></p><p>"Master, welcome back. Today's star beast feast has already begun, how would you like to have it tonight?"</p><p></p><p>"The usual way, just make a big meat platter."</p><p></p><p>"Understood."</p><p></p><p>After following him for so long, Huan Liuli has also become more and more useful.</p><p></p><p>In the past, Ye Xiao had to personally cook the meals, but now Huan Liuli has taken over this task and become the family's head chef.</p><p></p><p>This can greatly reduce Ye Xiao's time.</p><p></p><p>Moreover, this is something Huan Liuli actively requested to do, Ye Xiao did not force her, she volunteered.</p><p></p><p>In addition, there are many other changes.</p><p></p><p>For example, mopping the floor, doing laundry, and other housework.</p><p></p><p>In the past, Huan Liuli would just perfunctorily do these things, if Ye Xiao didn't supervise her, she might put her own stockings in the water and then directly hang them on the line, claiming she had washed them clean.</p><p></p><p>Of course, Huan Liuri's clothes themselves are not smelly, nor are her stockings, as a phantom cat, her physique seems to be the kind that doesn't get too dirty, always with a faint fragrance, perhaps to aid in the use of her spiritual techniques.</p><p></p><p>But without properly washing, it would be very uncomfortable for Ye Xiao, who has a slight obsession with cleanliness.</p><p></p><p>Now she has improved a lot.</p><p></p><p>However, Ye Xiao doesn't quite understand why she suddenly changed her personality in such a short time?</p><p></p><p>What Ye Xiao doesn't know is that Huan Liuli herself doesn't really want to be this way.</p><p></p><p>Cats are actually very averse to water and dislike dampness.</p><p></p><p>Until she saw the Great Dragon.</p><p></p><p>A very handsome knife!</p><p></p><p>And it's also a very spirited knife.</p><p></p><p>This made Huan Liuli feel threatened.</p><p></p><p>She feels that her position as Ye Xiao's major-domo is somewhat precarious.</p><p></p><p>She had promised to be Ye Xiao's servant for 1,500 years.</p><p></p><p>If the Great Dragon takes away too much of Ye Xiao's affection, will she be driven out? Or even end up like the other star beasts, being forced to give up her flesh every day? So, in order to maintain her position as major-domo, Huan Liuli is now very diligent.</p><p></p><p>Completely like a changed cat.</p><p></p><p>Diligent to the point that even she doesn't recognize herself anymore.</p><p></p><p>But she feels that this is still not enough, because she has recently discovered that the Great Dragon often accompanies the master, sometimes even merging into the palm of his hand.</p><p></p><p>So she decided that she must serve Ye Xiao even more diligently, to pull the master's heart back to her, to let him know that she is the best servant in this household!</p><p></p><p>She has recently learned a word called "internal competition".</p><p></p><p>As long as she succeeds in the internal competition, her position will be secured.</p><p></p><p>Before completely securing her position as the first major-domo, Huan Liuli can fully serve the master 24 hours a day without interruption.</p><p></p><p>"By the way, should I also consider sleeping with the master every day? After all, the Great Dragon sleeps next to the master every day, if I'm not there, he might secretly say something bad about me to the master!"</p><p></p><p>Huan Liuli thought about this matter as she was cooking.</p><p></p><p>On the other side, back in the room, Ye Xiao looked at the pages filled with golden light, his mood greatly improved, and he manipulated the Golden Book to directly click on the synthesis.</p><p></p><p>Soon, the Golden Book synthesized a brand new Emperor Technique-level technique - the Infinite Calamity Finger! This couldn't help but make Ye Xiao mock the Golden Book again, it really is a poor namer, now it doesn't even come up with the names itself, just modifying one character from the Formless Calamity Finger to make it a new technique name.</p><p></p><p>But it still sounds pretty impressive, at least better than his own naming of the weapon as the Great Dragon.</p><p></p><p>Then he began to drive the divine soul of the Golden Book to cultivate the Infinite Calamity Finger.</p><p></p><p>And he himself began to study the characteristics of the Infinite Calamity Finger.</p><p></p><p>Compared to other techniques, the finger techniques may be even more deadly in terms of destructive power.</p><p></p><p>Because with the same amount of spiritual energy, if using fist techniques or palm techniques...</p><p></p><p>Here is the full English translation of the Chinese excerpt:</p><p></p><p>The way it is deployed, it could be a large-scale destructive technique.</p><p></p><p>With finger techniques, the large-scale destructive methods can be concentrated into a single point, reducing the area of impact, making the destructive power even stronger.</p><p></p><p>In short, fist techniques and palm techniques can be called large-area destructive attack methods.</p><p></p><p>Finger techniques, on the other hand, are the best way to take down opponents in one-on-one confrontations.</p><p></p><p>Looking at it this way, in fact, each martial art is useful, it's not that once you've learned fist and palm techniques, you don't need to learn other martial arts.</p><p></p><p>Finger techniques are single-target lethal attacks, claw techniques can easily block others' movements, which is also a very useful skill in combat. Leg techniques are also very powerful, roughly equivalent to enhanced single-target attacks.</p><p></p><p>Anyway, there's no harm in learning more, the more skills the better.</p><p></p><p>A while later, the sound of Illusion Jade Dew calling him for dinner came from downstairs.</p><p></p><p>"Master, dinner is ready!"</p><p></p><p>This slightly coquettish voice made Ye Xiao involuntarily shudder.</p><p></p><p>He frowned slightly and went downstairs.</p><p></p><p>The Great Dragon immediately followed.</p><p></p><p>When outside, it attaches itself to the palm of Ye Xiao.</p><p></p><p>At home or when there are no outsiders, it will manifest its true form.</p><p></p><p>This is what Ye Xiao promised it, to give it a certain degree of freedom.</p><p></p><p>It has been sealed for many years and is already about to go crazy.</p><p></p><p>If it continues to be sealed every day, it probably will develop a split personality.</p><p></p><p>After Ye Xiao brought the Great Dragon downstairs, Illusion Jade Dew glanced at the Great Dragon, unable to resist scolding inwardly.</p><p></p><p>"Lackey! Sticking so close to you every day, isn't it just wanting to snatch the master's affection from me?</p><p></p><p>Hmph, I won't lose. I just went and bought a JK uniform and Balenciaga. Hehe."</p><p></p><p>Because of her continuous breakthroughs, she is now at the Innate Sixth Rank, so after taking on a human form, her height has reached over 1.6 meters, no different from an adult human female, and she is also very beautiful.</p><p></p><p>Coupled with the JK uniform and Balenciaga, things that men can't resist, she can easily make the Great Dragon retreat.</p><p></p><p>After all, no matter how much the Great Dragon can win the master's favor, it is ultimately just a weapon, and it can't even tell whether it's a knife or a sword.</p><p></p><p>How can such a thing compete with her? What can it use to compete with her? When Ye Xiao came down, Illusion Jade Dew immediately pulled out a chair for him and then handed him the bowl and chopsticks with both hands.</p><p></p><p>"Master, please have your meal."</p><p></p><p>Ye Xiao: "(...)"</p><p></p><p>"What's wrong with you lately? It's been almost half a month, and you're becoming less and less like your old self."</p><p></p><p>Illusion Jade Dew pretended to be coquettish and shy:</p><p></p><p>"Geez, Master, I'm just a little girl like this!"</p><p></p><p>"Ugh!"</p><p></p><p>Ye Xiao felt a bit nauseous, he really couldn't stand this silly cat's affected expressions, just like a green tea bitch on TV.</p><p></p><p>"If you have something to say, just say it directly, don't beat around the bush and be sarcastic."</p><p></p><p>Illusion Jade Dew was a bit aggrieved.</p><p></p><p>"Master, don't be angry! I've just been feeling that you've been with the Great Dragon every day, going to work together, bathing together, sleeping together, and I'm almost forgotten."</p><p></p><p>"Oh~!"</p><p></p><p>Ye Xiao finally understood what was going on.</p><p></p><p>He was wondering why Illusion Jade Dew had been so sarcastic towards him these days.</p><p></p><p>He even suspected that she was sick before. Now he realizes that this silly cat is just in heat!</p><p></p><p>After taking a deep breath, he patted Illusion Jade Dew's little head and comforted her:</p><p></p><p>"I'm sorry for making you feel uncomfortable, it's my fault."</p><p></p><p>"Master!"</p><p></p><p>Illusion Jade Dew's eyes were slightly reddened.</p><p></p><p>"You finally understand me, so can I... tonight?"</p><p></p><p>Ye Xiao nodded seriously.</p><p></p><p>"Of course, tonight you can sleep with the Great Dragon."</p><p></p><p>Illusion Jade Dew: "Σ(°△°|||)!"</p><p></p><p>Ye Xiao thought it through clearly.</p><p></p><p>He is human, and Illusion Jade Dew has always been unhappy that he turned her into a servant, so she definitely won't like him, right?</p><p></p><p>In this house, there are only him, Illusion Jade Dew, and the Great Dragon. </p><p></p><p>Other than him, Illusion Jade Dew can only like the Great Dragon, right? And the Great Dragon has been following him closely all this time, it must have made Illusion Jade Dew jealous.</p><p></p><p>So she must have lowered her dignity in an attempt to get him to approve of her and the Great Dragon.</p><p></p><p>After all, he is a very magnanimous master!</p><p></p><p>He absolutely won't prevent them, one is his star pet, the other is his weapon, from being together just because of that.</p><p></p><p>Since they've crossed over, the freedom to love should also be popularized.</p><p></p><p>Let them have a cross-racial love affair.</p><p></p><p>"Great Dragon, starting tonight, you'll sleep with Illusion Jade Dew. Although you've been forged into a weapon, your soul is that of a male dragon, so you must take good care of Illusion Jade Dew."</p><p></p><p>Six updates, 18,000 words.

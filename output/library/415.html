        <h1>Chapter 415</h1>
        <div class="content">
            <p>Here is the full English translation of the Chinese excerpt:</p><p></p><p>"There have been quite a few strange occurrences lately. You are often out on missions, so you need to be extra careful."</p><p></p><p>"Don't worry, I'm aware of the situation. By the way, could you help keep an eye out for us? If anyone is dragging around a big black coffin, be sure to let us know immediately. There will be a reward."</p><p></p><p>Ye Xiao nodded silently.</p><p></p><p>The big black coffin was currently resting quietly in his own cellar. They would probably never find it.</p><p></p><p>"Oh, Ye Xiao, you're still brewing wine? Wow, this wine is really good stuff!"</p><p></p><p>"I just made it recently, but you'd better not try to get your hands on it. The effects would be too intense for you to handle."</p><p></p><p>"Too intense? That powerful? Then I definitely want to try it. I've been working overtime a lot lately and my kidneys are feeling a bit depleted, so I was planning to replenish myself."</p><p></p><p>Ye Xiao thought for a moment.</p><p></p><p>"Alright, if you really want to drink it, I'll give you three drops. But you have to dilute it when you get back. Remember, you absolutely must dilute it before drinking. If you don't dilute it, you mustn't touch it at all, or you might end up exploding."</p><p></p><p>"Whoa, that powerful? Then I'll go find a big vat of water to dilute it and give it a try."</p><p></p><p>Ye Xiao nodded and gave him the three drops.</p><p></p><p>Gu Hai knew his own limits, so he shouldn't do anything reckless.</p><p></p><p>Afterwards, Gu Hai and the others drank a couple cups of spiritual tea, exchanged a few words, and then hurried out to continue their search.</p><p></p><p>Ye Xiao closed the door and resumed his meditative cultivation.</p><p></p><p>In the Ning family manor, Ning Zhiyuan and several of Ning family's uncles were seated solemnly in the main hall.</p><p></p><p>"It's unbelievable that the divine king's corpse we obtained with great difficulty was stolen right under our noses. We really suffered a huge loss.</p><p>We don't even know how much divine blood their bodies contain. If we could refine it, it would greatly boost our cultivation.</p><p>It's such a pity."</p><p></p><p>"Well, since it's already happened, there's nothing we can do about it. Our focus should now be on excavating the divine tombs. We also need to analyze the information from the divine king's tomb as much as possible. Maybe we can find other divine king tombs and obtain even more resources."</p><p></p><p>"Don't worry, I've already sent people to analyze it. I expect we'll have results soon."</p><p></p><p>As soon as Ning Zhiyuan finished speaking, several figures came rushing in, clearly in a panic.</p><p></p><p>"Young master, young master, something terrible has happened! Something terrible!"</p><p></p><p>Ning Zhiyuan raised his brow.</p><p></p><p>"Calm down and speak properly! What's the matter?"</p><p></p><p>But the people were unable to settle their emotions.</p><p></p><p>"Young master, something terrible has happened. This time, it's really serious."</p><p></p><p>"What terrible thing has happened?"</p><p></p><p>"From the remnant information of that divine king, we've analyzed that the Canglan Star Domain originally had an extremely powerful ancient divine kingdom. No, to be precise, the ancient divine kingdom controlled many star domains, and the Canglan Star Domain was just one of them."</p><p></p><p>"Yes! There were even divine emperor experts in that ancient divine kingdom!"</p><p></p><p>"Divine emperor? Are you telling me again? Is this true?"</p><p></p><p>At this moment, even Ning Zhiyuan and his uncles couldn't help but have their heartbeats quicken.</p><p></p><p>The group all stood up from their chairs.</p><p></p><p>"It's true! Absolutely certain, there was an ancient divine kingdom here in ancient times."</p><p></p><p>Ning Zhiyuan paced back and forth.</p><p></p><p>"I thought we were just digging out a few big fish. But it turns out we've dug up an entire ocean.</p><p>The ancient divine kingdom! Wouldn't that make it a more powerful existence than our Xuanyuan Clan? How many resources could there be here?"</p><p></p><p>"Zhiyuan, make a decision quickly. We must immediately notify the clan, no, the entire Xuanyuan Clan! This matter, if my guess is correct, the Star Alliance of the hundred tribes above the starry sky should also know about it.</p><p>They also have some resources from the divine king's tomb."</p><p></p><p>Ning Zhiyuan nodded.</p><p></p><p>"This matter is of utmost importance. If they know about this, they will surely summon even more powerful existences from the divine king realm to stabilize the situation as soon as possible.</p><p>If that happens, the Xuanyuan Clan members here may face great trouble.</p><p>Immediately notify the other families, they must also summon their divine king experts!"</p><p></p><p>"You're right. This time, if the ancient divine kingdom is real, although the Xuanyuan Clan may not be able to obtain all the resources, we must strive our utmost to try to get as many as possible."</p><p></p><p>In the following days, there was no major commotion in Jianghai City, and Ye Xiao went about his normal work routine.</p><p></p><p>However, by the fifth day, he vaguely sensed something different.</p><p></p><p>More people from the Ning family had been dispatched to the starry sky.</p><p></p><p>Not only that, the Ning family had also raised the admission threshold for the Martial Arts Academy, increased the number of classes, and even further distributed basic resources to greatly enhance the abilities of the cultivators in the Nine Provinces.</p><p></p><p>This was clearly not normal.</p><p></p><p>Were they preparing for war? Or was there some other reason? Normally, after the divine king's tomb had just been robbed, and no new divine king's tomb had been discovered, the two sides shouldn't be able to start fighting so soon, right?</p><p></p><p>As he was feeling puzzled,</p><p></p><p>Here is the full English translation of the Chinese excerpt:</p><p></p><p>It was then that Beitung Ce arrived at the library.</p><p></p><p>When he appeared before Yexiao, his expression was extremely serious. Those who didn't know might have thought Yexiao owed him millions.</p><p></p><p>"Senior Beitung, what's wrong? Why does your face look so grim?" </p><p></p><p>Beitung Ce looked around to make sure no one was nearby, then spoke:</p><p></p><p>"A major incident has occurred."</p><p></p><p>"What happened?"</p><p></p><p>"It turns out that the Canglang Star Domain we're in was the center of an ancient divine kingdom in the primordial era! That means there are divine emperor powerhouses buried here!"</p><p></p><p>Yexiao was a bit stunned.</p><p></p><p>He certainly knew there were divine emperor powerhouses in this star domain. </p><p></p><p>He had thought others would find out about this later, but it turned out they had learned of it so quickly.</p><p></p><p>Once the divine emperor's tomb was excavated, the secrets of the divine kingdom's treasury would likely no longer be hidden.</p><p></p><p>However, for now, they probably hadn't found the divine emperor's tomb yet, so Yexiao should still have some time.</p><p></p><p>The passage to the divine kingdom's treasury had already been excavated 80%, with only the last 20% remaining. It would take at most two months for him to open the divine kingdom's treasury.</p><p></p><p>Just give him two more months!</p><p></p><p>Seeing Yexiao remain silent, Beitung Ce thought he had been frightened by this news.</p><p></p><p>After all, even someone as extraordinary as Yexiao couldn't possibly not be shocked by something as monumental as an ancient divine kingdom. This made Beitung Ce feel a trace of small pleasure.</p><p></p><p>This brat had been so arrogant all the time, but now there was finally something that could scare him.</p><p></p><p>"Yexiao, that ancient divine kingdom very likely holds the opportunity for us to transform our bloodline powers that our ancestors left behind.</p><p></p><p>But it seems we may not have the chance to find it in time.</p><p></p><p>This news will spread quickly and attract countless divine clans from the starry sky.</p><p></p><p>This time, I and the Sage Emperor are prepared to venture into the starry sky.</p><p></p><p>One, we can improve our own strength.</p><p>Two, we also want to see if we can find any clues. If we can find clues about the ancient divine kingdom ahead of time, we can tell you promptly so you can seize the advantage and gain some benefits."</p><p></p><p>Yexiao nodded, feeling warmth in his heart.</p><p></p><p>These adorable old fellows, even though their strength was already far inferior to his own, still wanted to do something for him.</p><p></p><p>Although they weren't his true relatives, they were almost like family to him.</p><p></p><p>This trip to the starry sky would inevitably be fraught with danger.</p><p></p><p>If he didn't care at all, that would be too much.</p><p></p><p>Thinking of this, he nodded and then spoke:</p><p></p><p>"Alright, I have some weapons and armor here. Take them for all the seniors, in case you encounter danger and they can save your lives."</p><p></p><p>"Weapons and armor? We already have imperial-grade ones. You don't need to give us any."</p><p></p><p>"Having extra things is always safer. Wait here, I'll be right back."</p><p></p><p>With that, Yexiao immediately got up and went to the restroom, locking the door behind him. He then took out a pile of materials from his storage ring.</p><p></p><p>The materials he had were countless, all obtained from divine king tombs. They were worthless to him, so he might as well use them to forge some armor and weapons for the seniors, boosting their combat power.</p><p></p><p>If they encountered danger, they would have a way to escape.</p><p></p><p>Activating the Creation Treasure Art, Yexiao quickly created a batch of divine-grade weapons.</p><p></p><p>Of course, they were far inferior to the Great Dragon's, but compared to imperial-grade, they were at least ten times stronger! He also engraved divine-level formations on the armor, enhancing their spiritual energy gathering ability, defense, combat power amplification, and speed.</p><p></p><p>With the spiritual energy gathering formations, even if their cultivation was lacking, the formations would help them continuously absorb spiritual energy, preventing their combat power from weakening.</p><p></p><p>The enhanced defense could protect them from attacks above the divine realm.</p><p></p><p>The combat power amplification would greatly boost their fighting strength.</p><p></p><p>And the speed enhancement would be useful both in battle and for escaping.</p><p></p><p>The whole process only took a few minutes.</p><p></p><p>For Yexiao, who possessed the Creation Treasure Art, this was simple beyond simple.</p><p></p><p>Weapon forging was easy, but the armor was tricky. Since Beitung Ce and the others were all male, the armor designs were basically the same.</p><p></p><p>But Zhuque Senior and Baihu Senior were a problem - one seemed to be a 36D, the other maybe an E or even an F?</p><p></p><p>Soon, he put all these items into his storage ring and brought them to Beitung Ce.</p><p></p><p>"Here, Senior Beitung, take these. Each person can have a set. If they get damaged, just replace them directly."</p><p></p><p>Beitung Ce smiled.</p><p></p><p>"I'd like to see what good things you've brought. You're being so mysterious about it."</p><p></p><p>[Author's note: This is a chapter from a Chinese novel.

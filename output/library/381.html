        <h1>Chapter 381</h1>
        <div class="content">
            <p>Here is the full English translation of the Chinese excerpt:</p><p></p><p>"You old mule, dare you move, and I'll smash your face!" </p><p></p><p>"Damn it, do you really think I'm afraid of your Xuanyuan Clan?" </p><p></p><p>Boom! The next moment, there was a violent explosion outside, it was clear that a fight had broken out.</p><p></p><p>Ning Zhiyuan and the others, after seeing this scene, did not hesitate at all and immediately rushed out like streaks of light.</p><p></p><p>The other clan representatives also rushed out in an instant.</p><p></p><p>Soon, they saw a white jade vase, quietly standing in the corner.</p><p></p><p>The forces of both sides had already engaged in a fierce battle.</p><p></p><p>"Damn it! Charge! Seize that white jade vase."</p><p></p><p>This divine king's tomb was real, but there was nothing valuable inside, only this one vase. It was enough to see how precious the treasure inside the vase must be? It absolutely cannot fall into the other side's hands, otherwise all the effort of the past half-day would have been in vain.</p><p></p><p>The battle instantly entered a white-hot phase.</p><p></p><p>Both sides started to use killing moves to fight for the white jade vase, it was extremely ferocious!</p><p></p><p>Especially the clan representatives, these small divine clans originally had very few resources, far inferior to the core families of the Xuanyuan Clan.</p><p></p><p>Now that they had finally seen a treasure, they definitely would not let it go easily.</p><p></p><p>So they immediately launched the attack.</p><p></p><p>"Killâ€”!"</p><p></p><p>Boom, boom, boom, boom, boom. In an instant, the entire divine king's tomb was in a fierce battle, various colored divine art attack beams intertwined without end, to the point that it was difficult to tell whose attack it was.</p><p></p><p>Dust and smoke rose, and the flames kept burning and expanding.</p><p></p><p>Finally, in the midst of the scramble, a black streak of light from the Alliance of Clans seized that white jade vase first.</p><p></p><p>"Haha, this treasure is mine now, I've seized the treasure!"</p><p></p><p>As soon as the words left his mouth, he turned and ran.</p><p></p><p>The many young masters of the Xuanyuan Clan immediately spoke up, commanding their divine-level personal guards.</p><p></p><p>"Hurry! Hurry and stop him! Absolutely do not let him take that treasure away."</p><p></p><p>But unfortunately, as their guards were about to set out, the next second, the powerful cultivators of the clans fiercely attacked.</p><p></p><p>The experts who came in, divine-level and emperor-level, were evenly matched, just to prevent any cheating that would lead to unequal strength.</p><p></p><p>But the problem was, the emperor-level experts of the clans were not worth much.</p><p></p><p>They had cultivated for many years to reach their current realm.</p><p></p><p>Their aptitude was not strong, and they might even be stuck at this realm for the rest of their lives.</p><p></p><p>But the young masters of the major families were different, their aptitude was very strong, and they had broken through to the late emperor realm at an age of just a few decades.</p><p></p><p>Their future was full of potential, and they were also the key protected objects of the many families.</p><p></p><p>Based on this, their guards would definitely prioritize protecting them.</p><p></p><p>Therefore, they did not dare to exert too much force to deal with others.</p><p></p><p>They could only watch helplessly as the other party fled.</p><p></p><p>"Damn it!"</p><p></p><p>By the time the other party had fled far away, even if they wanted to chase, they would not be able to catch up.</p><p></p><p>"Haha, young masters, we won't play with you anymore, we'll take our leave first. Go back and enjoy our divine water! Haha, goodbye!"</p><p></p><p>One of the clan's divine-level experts threw down a divine thunder dan, causing a violent explosion that forced both sides to retreat, and then turned and ran.</p><p></p><p>"Damn it!"</p><p></p><p>Several young masters, watching this scene, were so angry that they coughed up blood, but were helpless, and could only watch them leave.</p><p></p><p>Ning Zhiyuan's expression was gloomy and unsettled.</p><p></p><p>"This time it's my fault, I didn't do a good job with the security. If I hadn't let the people of the Black Soul Clan break in, the news about the divine king's tomb wouldn't have been leaked, and today's events wouldn't have happened."</p><p></p><p>Ling Shao patted his shoulder.</p><p></p><p>"You don't need to blame yourself too much, success is 70% dependent on people, 30% on fate. You've done your best. If it weren't for you, we wouldn't have discovered even a single divine tomb."</p><p></p><p>At this moment, the ring on his hand suddenly flashed a few beams of light.</p><p></p><p>"What's the matter?"</p><p></p><p>He communicated with his mind, and the next moment, his face lit up.</p><p></p><p>"Good! I'm going back right away."</p><p></p><p>Then he spoke to his few friends:</p><p></p><p>"It seems that heaven is still watching over us, my people have dug up some good stuff, let's go back and take a look."</p><p></p><p>"Okay!"</p><p></p><p>The group quickly returned to the Xuanyuan Clan's camp.</p><p></p><p>An hour later, the group returned to the Xuanyuan Clan's camp, and a divine-level expert immediately came to greet them.</p><p></p><p>"Young master, you're finally back."</p><p></p><p>Ling Shaoyu swept a glance at the things behind him, which were covered by a huge tarpaulin, and couldn't help but feel a little puzzled.</p><p></p><p>"So that's the good stuff your people dug up? What is it?"</p><p></p><p>"Young master, why don't you guess what it is first?"</p><p></p><p>Ling Shaoyu said impatiently, "Cut the suspense, my lord is not in a good mood right now after just being humiliated, just report it!"</p><p></p><p>"Young master, this is the Pillar of the Heavens from the ancient times!"</p><p></p><p>"What! It's actually the Pillar of the Heavens?!"</p><p></p><p>Here is my translation of the Chinese excerpt:</p><p></p><p>Ning Zhiyuan looked at the other person and couldn't help but ask in puzzlement, "Song Qingxue, do you know what this thing is?"</p><p></p><p>Song Qingxue nodded.</p><p></p><p>"This thing is a treasure from the ancient times, used to gather talents. It is said to be forged by grinding the bones of the ancient dragon, phoenix, and qilin tribes into powder, and then using secret methods. </p><p></p><p>Because these three tribes have the strongest innate bloodlines, they can naturally suppress all other bloodlines, and also detect them.</p><p></p><p>If you place it on the ground and activate it, it will light up based on the number of geniuses in that area. The more genius bloodlines there are, the higher it will light up.  The fewer genius bloodlines, the lower it will light up."</p><p></p><p>"Oh? There is actually such a divine artifact!" </p><p></p><p>The crowd couldn't help but exclaim in amazement.</p><p></p><p>The competition in the starry sky is actually very fierce! Every divine tribe fights for talents!</p><p></p><p>But geniuses are extremely hard to find. </p><p></p><p>This thing cannot be discovered just by a glance, to see who is a genius.</p><p></p><p>The vast majority of people are ordinary. The idea of being able to kill a large group of geniuses with a single brick is just a dream.</p><p></p><p>But with this divine artifact, finding geniuses becomes much more convenient. </p><p></p><p>Just place it in an area under your control, and if there are any geniuses, you can then conduct a more detailed search, greatly reducing the manpower and resources required.</p>

        <h1>Chapter 89</h1>
        <div class="content">
            <p>Here is the full English translation of the Chinese excerpt:</p><p></p><p>Ye Xiao quickly arrived at the breakfast shop next to the Huaxi Theater. From a distance, he could see that there were quite a few people in line.</p><p></p><p>As an old shop with a century-old heritage in the Jianghai City, the Huaxi Theater breakfast not only had online reservations, but also kept a certain number of seats available for customers to line up and enjoy. Customers were also allowed to come to the shop and purchase takeout.</p><p></p><p>The line extended from the breakfast shop's door all the way to the street corner, a distance of about three to four hundred meters.</p><p></p><p>Beyond this distance, there were no more people in line, and it was already 8 o'clock - those who hadn't lined up yet wouldn't be able to get breakfast.</p><p></p><p>Ye Xiao entered through the side door for reserved customers, verified his identity, and was quickly led to a window seat on the third floor.</p><p></p><p>Soon, the delicious and exquisite meal arrived, and just looking at it made Ye Xiao's throat involuntarily move.</p><p></p><p>At this moment, the manager sent Ye Xiao a WeChat message, explaining the situation. It turned out that she wanted to introduce a potential match to Ye Xiao, and that's why they were meeting here.</p><p></p><p>She also sent Ye Xiao a photo of the woman.</p><p></p><p>This left Ye Xiao speechless. What did he need a match for? It's not like he could eat her!</p><p></p><p>He had been planning to leave, but then he looked at the breakfast in front of him.</p><p></p><p>Well, whatever, he'll just meet her and then say they're not suitable, and finish the breakfast first. After all, in this world, only delicious food should not be wasted.</p><p></p><p>Huan Liuli was also drooling beside him.</p><p></p><p>"The breakfast here is really delicious. Look at these buns - they're not too dark, not smelly, and the right size! And these youtiao (fried dough sticks), they're crispy on the outside and soft on the inside, not too short or too soft, just right! And this congee, it's as smooth as milk, the rice is cooked to perfection, it must be good for the stomach!"</p><p></p><p>Ye Xiao nodded, then took out an empty plate and served Huan Liuli a pork bun and a crab roe bun.</p><p></p><p>"This is your reward from last night."</p><p></p><p>Huan Liuli: "(._.)!"</p><p></p><p>Watching Ye Xiao eat so delightedly, Huan Liuli's heart was itching with resentment. Was this measly offering supposed to appease her? What cat would be satisfied with this?</p><p></p><p>If she could, she would have pounced on him with her claws. But since she couldn't beat him, she could only wait. In three hundred years, she would definitely make Ye Xiao her beloved human, and then serve him a table full of delicacies while giving him only a hard bun, so he would know the wheel of karma turns.</p><p></p><p>Just as human and cat were eating, a familiar voice suddenly sounded.</p><p></p><p>"You two are also having breakfast here?"</p><p></p><p>Ye Xiao paused and looked up to see Qin Yuyan. He nodded.</p><p></p><p>"What a coincidence? You're here too?"</p><p></p><p>"Yes, the breakfast here is very delicious."</p><p></p><p>"Have you ordered yet?"</p><p></p><p>"Not yet."</p><p></p><p>"Then would you like to join me?"</p><p></p><p>"Okay." Qin Yuyan smiled and sat down across from Ye Xiao.</p><p></p><p>But as soon as she sat down, Ye Xiao pushed all the steamed buns, dumplings, and fried bread towards himself, leaving half the table free for Qin Yuyan.</p><p></p><p>"You can call the server to order."</p><p></p><p>Qin Yuyan: "Σ(°△°|||)!"</p><p></p><p>"Didn't you invite me to join you?"</p><p></p><p>Ye Xiao paused, then nodded seriously.</p><p></p><p>"Yes, that's why I cleared half the table for you to order. We're eating at the same table, so we're eating together."</p><p></p><p>Qin Yuyan: "(_..)!"</p><p></p><p>She felt her mind was a bit twisted at the moment.</p><p></p><p>Although these were Ye Xiao's ordered dishes and he didn't have to share them with her, as friends they would normally invite each other to eat together. But Ye Xiao...</p><p></p><p>The licking Huan Liuli glanced at Qin Yuyan and saw her thoughts. She couldn't help but inwardly mock: "Give it up, this glutton, he'll let you have anything but his food, especially the delicious stuff."</p><p></p><p>Here is the full English translation of the Chinese excerpt:</p><p></p><p>"Even if you're really beautiful, it's useless. After all, being beautiful doesn't mean you can eat, and the places where you can eat definitely won't let you eat."</p><p></p><p>After saying this, her gaze lingered on Qin Yuyan for a second.</p><p></p><p>After being depressed for a moment, Qin Yuyan ordered some food, as she was a girl and it wouldn't be very proper to just sit there.</p><p></p><p>She ordered a plate of xiaolongbao and a bowl of red bean porridge.</p><p></p><p>As a girl, her eating was different from Ye Xiao's - she gently blew on the food, only taking small bites, just like the elegant beauties in books.</p><p></p><p>However, this way was certainly less efficient, and it took her a while to finish eating, long after Ye Xiao had finished.</p><p></p><p>Qin Yuyan took out a napkin to wipe the corners of her mouth, and couldn't help but ask, "Didn't you finish eating? Why are you still not leaving?"</p><p></p><p>Ye Xiao took a sip of the tea that had been served, and replied calmly:</p><p></p><p>"The director tricked me into coming here for a blind date, to introduce me to a match."</p><p></p><p>Qin Yuyan was somewhat amused and bewildered.</p><p></p><p>"You're also here for a blind date?"</p><p></p><p>Ye Xiao glanced at her.</p><p></p><p>"You too?"</p><p></p><p>Qin Yuyan nodded.</p><p></p><p>"My grandfather's old friend insists on introducing his grandson to me, and made an appointment for us to meet here."</p><p></p><p>"The director introduced me to the granddaughter of his second sister."</p><p></p><p>"The granddaughter of Ouyang Nainai's second sister? She must be very beautiful, right?"</p><p></p><p>"She's alright, but she's definitely not as beautiful as you, the campus belle. But I never really wanted to date anyone in the first place, so after I talk to her for a bit, I'll just leave."</p><p></p><p>After all, he had just eaten the breakfast the director had ordered, so he had to at least give it a try.</p><p></p><p>"Me too, I just want to get my teaching certificate right now, and in the next few years, I also want to try to break through to the Innate Realm, so I also plan to just go through the motions and then politely decline."</p><p></p><p>Ye Xiao could tell at a glance that Qin Yuyan's cultivation was already at the Acquired Eighth Rank, and her progress was very fast.</p><p></p><p>"By the way, what does your blind date look like? Since she's Ouyang Nainai's niece, she should also be from the Jianghai Martial Arts Academy. Maybe I know her, and I can give you a reference. If she's a good person, you can consider it."</p><p></p><p>"No need, I never wanted to date anyone in the first place."</p><p></p><p>"Alright then."</p><p></p><p>The two sat at the table, suddenly at a loss for words, each resting their chin on their arm and looking out the window.</p><p></p><p>However, just at that moment, Ye Xiao's brow suddenly furrowed.</p><p></p><p>Because he saw a figure across the street, no, to be precise, two figures, hand in hand.</p><p></p><p>"Huh? That looks like my blind date!"</p><p></p><p>"Where?"</p><p></p><p>"Over there, see, the two holding hands."</p><p></p><p>Ye Xiao pointed, and Qin Yuyan also raised her eyebrows.</p><p></p><p>"That's not your blind date, that's my blind date."</p><p></p><p>After saying this, the air fell silent again.</p><p></p><p>The two sat dumbfounded in front of the window, staring at the other pair.</p><p></p><p>Ye Xiao: "(_..)!"</p><p></p><p>Qin Yuyan: "(_..)!"</p><p></p><p>"They went into the hotel."</p><p></p><p>"I know."</p><p></p><p>"Why would they go to a hotel in broad daylight?"</p><p></p><p>"I don't know."</p><p></p><p>This is the end of the first update.

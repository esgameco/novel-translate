        <h1>Chapter 365</h1>
        <div class="content">
            <p>Here is the full English translation of the Chinese excerpt:</p><p></p><p>"What? What did you say? Say it again."</p><p></p><p>"Okay, I understand."</p><p></p><p>The attendant woman responsible for taking care of Ning Zhiyuan on the spiritual energy ship of the Ning clan quickly came up to the deck, carefully speaking to Ning Zhiyuan who was leaning on the railing:</p><p></p><p>"Young Master Ning, there's trouble down below."</p><p></p><p>Ning Zhiyuan, who had been leisurely watching the Xuanyuan Clan members digging graves, changed expression in an instant, revealing a hint of coldness.</p><p></p><p>"What happened?"</p><p></p><p>The woman swallowed her saliva and said cautiously, "People have died on the ground. It was done by the Three Deity Clan, they sent spies over. When our people tried to intercept them, two Empyrean Realm experts were killed, and one outstanding disciple who had just entered the King Realm was also severely injured."</p><p></p><p>Ning Zhiyuan's expression immediately turned grim, like a layer of frost had covered his face.</p><p></p><p>"The Three Deity Clan!"</p><p></p><p>He clenched his fists, and the murderous intent on his face grew increasingly intense and unceasing.</p><p></p><p>Currently, the most powerful Xuanyuan Clan in this area, who could be considered the decision-maker of the Xuanyuan Clan, was him.</p><p></p><p>The Three Deity Clan daring to make a move on the ground was like urinating on his head and slapping his face. </p><p></p><p>If this got out, he didn't know how many people would mock him.</p><p></p><p>"Those damned fools, it seems I should go there in person."</p><p></p><p>The woman's expression changed slightly, with some concern:</p><p></p><p>"Young Master, isn't this a bit reckless? We don't know how much strength the Three Deity Clan has deployed in this star domain. What if it's higher than we imagined? If you go and can't come back, that would be a real disaster.</p><p></p><p>Compared to that, the deaths of just two people are not serious enough to be on par with your safety."</p><p></p><p>Ning Zhiyuan said coldly:</p><p></p><p>"At this time, if I don't come out, I will never be able to hold my head up high in the Xuanyuan Clan again. Ning Guanshi! Come with me."</p><p></p><p>As his words faded, the air twisted, and the figure of Ning Guanshi gradually appeared by his side.</p><p></p><p>Ning Guanshi's appearance revealed a man in his fifties.</p><p></p><p>He clasped his hands behind his back and smiled slightly, "I will follow your orders, young master."</p><p></p><p>Ning Zhiyuan nodded and transformed into a beam of light, shooting towards the distance, with Ning Guanshi closely following.</p><p></p><p>The two beams of light disappeared into the starry sky like fleeting meteors.</p><p></p><p>The maidservant worried, "Young Master Ning, please be careful."</p><p></p><p>Although someone like Ning Zhiyuan could be revived by the clan if he died, death was still death, and it would definitely damage his vitality and affect his future martial dao development. </p><p></p><p>Therefore, if he could avoid death, it would be best.</p><p></p><p>On the other side, after Ye Xiao directly blasted away Maikang with one move, the following Winged Deity Clan expert, Katomer, immediately frowned coldly.</p><p></p><p>"Scoundrel! You are too arrogant. This is not a place where you can run wild!"</p><p></p><p>With that, he directly struck towards Ye Xiao with a palm!</p><p></p><p>The fierce palm wind roared in the starry sky, causing the surrounding spiritual energy to fluctuate and then explode into countless electric sparks. The electricity converged on the fist, gathering but not dispersing, with a terrifying momentum.</p><p></p><p>Baburu and the others narrowed their eyes slightly.</p><p></p><p>This move was one of the top-ranking techniques of the Winged Deity Clan, reaching the level of a Six-Star Divine Art.</p><p></p><p>Katomer was a super expert at the Empyrean Realm 104 Dragons, and the power of this move was extraordinary, absolutely capable of inflicting fatal damage on Ye Xiao.</p><p></p><p>Ye Xiao looked at the incoming palm, but didn't take it seriously at all.</p><p></p><p>As the opponent's palm wind approached him, Ye Xiao casually raised his right hand and unleashed a Falling God Palm.</p><p></p><p>The instant the Nine-Star Divine Art was unleashed, the explosive power completely crushed the opponent.</p><p></p><p>Ye Xiao's palm print contained a nine-colored glow, and just a glimpse of that light made everyone around feel their breathing quicken.</p><p></p><p>The most terrifying thing was not even this - the moment it appeared, the lightning that had been shrouding Katomer's palm was as if it had encountered an extremely formidable force, and it was instantly scattered, flying backwards and striking Katomer's body, severely electrocuting him.</p><p></p><p>"Katomer, retreat quickly, you are not his match, someone will die."</p><p></p><p>The other experts couldn't help but remind him.</p><p></p><p>When Katomer was struck by the electricity, his mind had already realized Ye Xiao's terrifying power.</p><p></p><p>He was not Ye Xiao's opponent at all.</p><p></p><p>But he had already braked too late, as he had initially attacked with the determination to kill Ye Xiao, and his attack speed was simply too fast, while Ye Xiao's speed was not even that fast in comparison.</p><p></p><p>It was he who couldn't stop in time.</p><p></p><p>Boom! Their palms collided forcefully.</p><p></p><p>Katomer's palm was larger and his strike speed was faster, with a fierce and terrifying technique.</p><p></p><p>Ye Xiao's palm was slender, and his strike speed was also very slow, appearing soft and powerless.</p><p></p><p>But when their palms met, Katomer's palm suddenly exploded into a mist of blood.</p><p></p><p>The explosion range not only covered his hand, but also his entire arm, then his upper body, and finally his whole body.</p><p></p><p>Boom! He...</p><p></p><p>Here is my translation of the Chinese excerpt you provided:</p><p></p><p>It was as if he had set off firecrackers, exploding his entire body. </p><p></p><p>Instant kill!</p><p></p><p>All who witnessed this scene couldn't help but have their pupils constrict.</p><p></p><p>So powerful!</p><p></p><p>Everyone knew Katomer's strength well. That he was so powerful, yet was one-shot by Ye Xiao, was already surprising enough. What was more terrifying was that Ye Xiao seemed to not have even used his full strength.</p><p></p><p>Baburu trembled and hastily cupped his hands, saying, "Milord, who exactly are you? What have we done wrong? Must you treat us this way? Please explain clearly, so that we may accept our deaths willingly."</p><p></p><p>Unfortunately, Ye Xiao paid no attention to Katomer, just as he would not pay attention to Baburu.</p><p></p><p>Duanxinghe struck, a massive and invisible force instantly clamping around the other's neck.</p><p></p><p>Crack!</p><p></p><p>With a crisp sound, Baburu's neck was directly twisted into rubble.</p><p></p><p>"Damn it!"</p><p></p><p>The crowd's expressions changed drastically, and they immediately turned to flee.</p><p></p><p>Things had reached this point, if they still didn't know to run, they would truly be fools. </p><p></p><p>And a group of fools at that.</p><p></p><p>It was obvious they couldn't defeat Ye Xiao, and continuing to stay here would only be throwing their lives away.</p><p></p><p>Rather than that, it would be better to flee.</p><p></p><p>Ye Xiao was not hurried. Duanxinghe activated, directly dividing his power into countless strands to control and kill everyone.</p><p></p><p>Under his mental control, these Three God Tribe experts who dared to try and escape kept screaming in heart-rending shrieks. </p><p></p><p>But even so, their bodies were mercilessly pulled back by Ye Xiao.</p><p></p><p>"No—! No—!"</p><p></p><p>"Who can save us?"</p><p></p><p>The agonized cries echoed through the surrounding star domain.</p><p></p><p>After they were pulled back, Ye Xiao once again unleashed the Nine Star Divine Art - Sacrifice to Heaven Finger!</p><p></p><p>With the Sacrifice to Heaven Finger, the winds and clouds churned, dozens of beams of light directly and ruthlessly destroying everyone's hearts and souls.</p><p></p><p>Plop plop. In the next moment, these people fell down like dumplings.</p><p></p><p>One move, instantly killing dozens of Emperors. This terrifying technique truly made people shudder in fear.</p><p></p><p>But on Ye Xiao's face, he remained calm and indifferent, as if killing these Emperor Realm experts was just a trivial matter, not worth mentioning at all.</p><p></p><p>After killing all of them, Ye Xiao strode towards the command center.</p><p></p><p>Inside the command center, Maige's pants were already wet with urine.</p><p></p><p>He trembled, looking at Ye Xiao.</p><p></p><p>He was probably clear in his heart that this guy had most likely come for him.</p><p></p><p>Because he was the only one not killed, and in his hand, he still had a pair of Divine Eyes!</p><p></p><p>"Gulp!"</p><p></p><p>He forcefully swallowed his saliva, staring fixatedly at Ye Xiao, pretending to be calm as he said, "I admit you are very strong, but by doing this, aren't you afraid of starting a war? </p><p></p><p>The Xuanyuan Clan may be powerful, but we Three Tribes also have even stronger races backing us!</p><p></p><p>If a war really breaks out, your Xuanyuan Clan won't fare well either."</p><p></p><p>Ye Xiao replied indifferently:</p><p></p><p>"Return the things you shouldn't have taken."</p><p></p><p>Maige's teeth clenched.</p><p></p><p>That pair of Ghostly Flame Divine Eyes was a good item, and he had gone to great lengths to get his hands on it. If he had to just hand it over, he would be quite unwilling.</p><p></p><p>But if he didn't hand it over, he would die! Yet for some reason, he was still stubbornly resisting, confronting Ye Xiao without handing over the ring or speaking.</p><p></p><p>Finally, in the next moment, the air began to distort, and a winged Shen Tribe expert with wings on his back slowly stepped out from within.</p><p></p><p>Seeing this scene, Maige was overjoyed, his gaze no longer containing any fear. At this moment, his eyes were full of gloating and smugness.</p><p></p><p>Clearly, this expert was someone he had summoned through special means, a Shen Tribe Saint Realm expert! This was also why he hadn't handed over the Ghostly Flame Divine Eyes just now.</p><p></p><p>He had been waiting, waiting for his savior to appear.</p><p></p><p>Now that this Saint Realm expert had arrived, he wouldn't have to die.</p><p></p><p>Once Ye Xiao was dead, he could directly take the Ghostly Flame Divine Eyes for himself!</p><p></p><p>Haha haha!</p><p></p><p>He sneered maliciously.</p><p></p><p>"You know, you shouldn't have said that nonsense to me just now. You should have just killed me and taken back the item. Now that my savior has arrived, you're dead."</p><p></p><p>Ye Xiao glanced at him indifferently, and that Shen Tribe Saint Realm expert held his head high, with a lofty air, seemingly not placing Ye Xiao in his eyes at all.</p><p></p><p>"Xuanyuan Clan brat, you dare to..."</p><p></p><p>Before he could even finish the word "offend", there was a sudden 'bang', and he directly exploded into a mist of blood.</p><p></p><p>Ye Xiao unleashed his precious technique for the first time!</p><p></p><p>Annihilation Precious Art!</p><p></p><p>One strike, instantly killing a Saint Realm expert!</p><p></p><p>"Now your savior is gone."</p>

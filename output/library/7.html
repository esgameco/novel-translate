        <h1>Chapter 7</h1>
        <div class="content">
            <p>Here is the full English translation of the Chinese excerpt:</p><p></p><p>After reading books for two hours, Ye Xiao felt that his small goal was not very realistic.</p><p></p><p>He sighed softly, feeling that it would be better to lower his goal a bit and first strive to enter the Innate Second Grade.</p><p></p><p>Because there were just too many pirated versions, to the extent that he couldn't find two other source cultivation methods even after half a day of searching.</p><p></p><p>There were too many thorns on the path of progress, taking big steps would easily break the egg.</p><p></p><p>He just needed to try to find some heart cultivation methods first, strive to integrate an advanced heart cultivation method as soon as possible, and enhance his spiritual energy recovery speed.</p><p></p><p>This would also indirectly enhance his combat power.</p><p></p><p>So Ye Xiao slowed down his pace and continued to read the Star Beast Annals that he had been reading recently.</p><p></p><p>This was a serialized book that would release new series irregularly.</p><p></p><p>The main content was essentially a star beast encyclopedia, a bit like the ancient Shanhaijing, but the Shanhaijing was fictional, while this Star Beast Annals was real.</p><p></p><p>The copy Ye Xiao had was a new series - the Tiger Changeling! He opened the first page of the book, and the exquisite layout caught his eye.</p><p></p><p>In ancient human legends, after a tiger eats a person, it will not let the person's soul leave, but will make the soul become its servant, until it lures another human for the tiger to eat, only then will it release the original soul.</p><p></p><p>In the star beasts, such things also exist.</p><p></p><p>But the star beasts don't need to eat humans, they can control humans through coercion, temptation, or mental compulsion, in order to use them to carry out surveillance, reconnaissance, attack and other spy activities.</p><p></p><p>The Tiger Changeling is the same as a normal person, but their innate nature has been transformed by the star beast, and they will kill humans like the star beasts, posing a threat no weaker than the star beasts.</p><p></p><p>In fact, they may pose an even greater threat than the star beasts.</p><p></p><p>Because they look the same as humans and are good at hiding, humans rarely discover their true identity.</p><p></p><p>Only cultivators at the Patriarch Realm or above, whose five senses and six consciousnesses have been greatly enhanced, can perceive their identity.</p><p></p><p>The only difference between the Tiger Changeling and humans is that they have a murderous aura, just like the star beasts, wanting to hunt humans!</p><p></p><p>Seeing this, Ye Xiao couldn't help but frown slightly.</p><p></p><p>"Strange, why does it feel like the person I saw in the Defense Corps before is very similar to the description here? Could he be the Tiger Changeling?"</p><p></p><p>If he really is the Tiger Changeling, and has entered the prison where there are research star beasts... it's probably not a good thing.</p><p></p><p>It seems I should tell the Defense Corps, after all, I also live in Jianghai City.</p><p></p><p>If he is the Tiger Changeling, it might make life in Jianghai City a mess.</p><p></p><p>And the Defense Corps has an anonymous message board, so they won't find out it's me.</p><p></p><p>Perfect.</p><p></p><p>Ye Xiao took out his phone and operated it for a while.</p><p></p><p>"Duang~."</p><p></p><p>After finishing the last page, the sound of the end-of-work bell rang, and Ye Xiao closed the book.</p><p></p><p>Dinner time.</p><p></p><p>Today at noon, the cafeteria had a few dishes that Ye Xiao liked - mapo tofu, Hangzhou-style beef, and spicy chicken.</p><p></p><p>He had just picked up his tray and found a seat, but hadn't had a chance to sit down yet, when Gu Hai came over and plopped down in the seat across from him.</p><p></p><p>"Old Ye, I transferred the money to you, remember to collect it."</p><p></p><p>Ye Xiao nodded.</p><p></p><p>"Old Ye, who is this new Patriarch? I've never heard of him before, who is trying to break through to the Patriarch Realm?"</p><p></p><p>Ye Xiao shook his head.</p><p></p><p>"I don't know either."</p><p></p><p>"Ah! If I were a Patriarch, that would be great. Then I wouldn't have to let you pretend to be my dad today, I'd like to see who dares to arrest me."</p><p></p><p>Gu Hai swallowed his saliva, a trace of longing visible in his eyes.</p><p></p><p>Here is the full English translation of the Chinese excerpt:</p><p></p><p>That was a Grandmaster expert!</p><p></p><p>Although it's said that Jianghai City graduates 100,000 people every year, only about 10 or so can cultivate to the level of a Grandmaster expert.</p><p></p><p>And these 10 people don't immediately become Grandmaster experts either. They have to go through decades of arduous cultivation and seize great opportunities before they can break through the innate and achieve the Grandmaster realm! If he became a Grandmaster, he would be willing to live 10 years less!</p><p></p><p>"If you become a Grandmaster, do you still need to go to the Red Romance?" </p><p></p><p>Ye Xiao's sudden words made Gu Hai pause, then he slapped his forehead.</p><p></p><p>"That's right! With my brain, if I become a Grandmaster, the women chasing after me would have to run three laps around Jianghai City first before they can get to me. Why would I go to the Red Romance and spend money there?</p><p></p><p>No way! I have to hurry and get a student ID, then go listen to the professors' lectures at the Jingdu Martial Arts University. Maybe that will be the opportunity for me to become a Grandmaster expert."</p><p></p><p>With that, he quickly wolfed down the rest of his meal and dashed off.</p><p></p><p>"Old Ye, I'm leaving first. Remember to clock me out at 2 o'clock."</p><p></p><p>Ye Xiao shook his head helplessly. </p><p></p><p>It was hard for him to fully understand Gu Hai's thoughts, and it wasn't just because of his carefree nature and lack of desire to pursue cultivation strength.</p><p></p><p>The main reason was that becoming a Grandmaster was too easy for him.</p><p></p><p>Normal people would take at least a decade or more to cultivate to the Grandmaster realm. </p><p></p><p>If he remembered correctly, a book had recorded that the fastest human in history to break through to the Grandmaster realm was the famous general Li Cunxiao in ancient times. He advanced from a First-Grade Warrior to the Grandmaster realm in only 8 years, two months faster than the tyrants Xiang Yu and Lu Bu.</p><p></p><p>Unfortunately, he never broke through to the Divine Grandmaster realm, so the peak of his life was being a general.</p><p></p><p>As for himself, he had only spent half a year.</p><p></p><p>From this perspective, could it be that he was the number one genius in the world?</p><p></p><p>Of course, Ye Xiao wouldn't be too smug about it.</p><p></p><p>After all, he was a recorded genius, and there were surely some unrecorded geniuses out there who might have been born Innate Experts.</p><p></p><p>Truly being the world's number one meant you would always lose, no matter what.</p><p></p><p>Moreover, even if he, Ye Xiao, was currently the world's fastest cultivator, his cultivation was still far from being the world's strongest.</p><p></p><p>Until he grew to become the number one under heaven, he would always be trash!</p><p></p><p>*burp*</p><p></p><p>After eating his fill, he continued reading.</p><p></p><p>Reading made Ye Xiao stronger, and learning made him happy.</p><p></p><p>However, when he just arrived at the area he managed, he couldn't help but pause.</p><p></p><p>There was a girl sitting at a desk, reading a book in his area.</p><p></p><p>The library didn't close at noon, so it was normal for readers to be here, but Ye Xiao was puzzled that she had come to the third floor to read the basic cultivation techniques.</p><p></p><p>The girl was very beautiful, with a crystal-clear, flawless face that was fair and rosy. As she read, half of her long, straight black hair fell down, adding a scholarly air to her.</p><p></p><p>It's just that she might have eaten too many papayas, which slightly disrupted the overall pure atmosphere.</p><p></p><p>But Ye Xiao just glanced at her once, then returned to his own seat, continuing to read with his back to the girl.</p><p></p><p>She might be beautiful, but for Ye Xiao, books were far more attractive than women.</p><p></p><p>Because reading could make him stronger, while looking at women would only waste his time.</p>

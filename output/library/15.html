        <h1>Chapter 15</h1>
        <div class="content">
            <p>Here is the full English translation of the Chinese excerpt:</p><p></p><p>Since ancient times, whenever a new dynasty replaced the old, the current emperor would completely eliminate the bloodline of the previous dynasty! </p><p></p><p>Why? One reason is that the other side's bloodline had produced an emperor before, and they could potentially produce a new emperor again, which would be detrimental to the current ruler's reign.</p><p></p><p>The other reason is that they possessed cultivation methods that transcended the superficial world, methods that could truly communicate with the Tao of Heaven and Earth.</p><p></p><p>They call these kinds of cultivation methods - Imperial Arts!</p><p></p><p>Qin Shenglong nodded. </p><p></p><p>"I know, but those levels of cultivation methods are all closely guarded secrets, only possessed by the top hereditary families and a few elite martial arts academies.</p><p></p><p>People like us don't even have the qualifications to come into contact with them."</p><p></p><p>After a pause, he suddenly shuddered, his face revealing a look of fear and excitement.</p><p></p><p>"Elder Dou, you aren't saying that the cultivation method... it... it... is an Imperial Art, are you?"</p><p></p><p>Dou Changfeng took a deep breath, looking at the stone tablet containing the cultivation method the way one would look at a lover.</p><p></p><p>"Not necessarily, I don't dare to determine that for certain. But it is 100% absolutely beyond the Grandmaster level.</p><p></p><p>In recent years, the Martial Arts Academy in the capital has been conducting a secret research project, trying to develop a cultivation method that surpasses the Grandmaster level, so that the Nine Provinces can break free from the constraints of the aristocratic families.</p><p></p><p>I've also been participating in this research, coming into contact with countless Grandmaster level cultivation methods.</p><p></p><p>But I can tell you with certainty, this cultivation method completely surpasses any Grandmaster level method.</p><p></p><p>Even if it's not an Imperial Art, it's at least a Sub-Imperial Art! In any case, the preciousness of this cultivation method is far beyond your imagination.</p><p></p><p>That's why I told you to delete all the photos you took.</p><p></p><p>Our family's previous cultivation methods were only at the Sub-Grandmaster level, which could be displayed publicly. But this method, absolutely cannot be revealed."</p><p></p><p>Qin Shenglong's eyes revealed a look of solemnity and envy.</p><p></p><p>"It's a pity, I'm a sword cultivator, so I can't cultivate this method.</p><p></p><p>But it may be Heaven's reward to you, after all, if you hadn't resolutely contributed your swordsmanship back then, you might not have obtained this method now."</p><p></p><p>Dou Changfeng nodded.</p><p></p><p>"The current problem is, we need to find out who the person is that can complete this cultivation method?"</p><p></p><p>"The person who can complete the cultivation method..."</p><p></p><p>Qin Shenglong's body suddenly trembled, extremely excited.</p><p></p><p>"Could it be him? I know who it is! It must be him!"</p><p></p><p>"Who?" </p><p></p><p>Dou Changfeng's face lit up with joy, also becoming excited.</p><p></p><p>"Hmm, I don't know him."</p><p></p><p>Dou Changfeng's smile immediately disappeared, he couldn't even maintain his decades-old composure.</p><p></p><p>"Are you sick?"</p><p></p><p>Qin Shenglong laughed awkwardly, embarrassed. "It's like this..."</p><p></p><p>When Qin Shenglong told the story of the mysterious swordsman, Dou Changfeng's expression became extremely grave.</p><p></p><p>"I never imagined that such a supreme expert would appear in Jianghai City."</p><p></p><p>There may not be many Grandmasters in Jianghai City, but there are plenty of Grandmasters globally. </p><p></p><p>Moreover, Dou Changfeng was based in the capital, so the waves caused by Jianghai City were not known to him.</p><p></p><p>Qin Shenglong nodded.</p><p></p><p>"From the way he struck down the Star Beast and saved me and Cloud, I think he's not an enemy of Jianghai City. To be honest, if it weren't for him, you might not have seen me again when you returned this time.</p><p></p><p>Jianghai City is so fortunate to have such a great Grandmaster, truly a rare blessing!"</p><p></p><p>"Great Grandmaster?"</p><p></p><p>Dou Changfeng smiled.</p><p></p><p>Qin Shenglong's brow furrowed slightly.</p><p></p><p>"What? Did I say something wrong?"</p><p></p><p>Dou Changfeng stared at the stone tablet.</p><p></p><p>"I can guarantee with my personal integrity that he is absolutely not weaker than the peak of Great Grandmasters, and only grows stronger! He can be considered a Sub-Divine Grandmaster!"</p><p></p><p>Qin Shenglong was immediately dumbfounded, his mouth gaping wide open, his jaw almost dropping to the ground.</p><p></p><p>"Sub-Divine Grandmaster? You're not joking with me, right? This small Jianghai City could have a Sub-Divine Grandmaster?"</p><p></p><p>"Who knows, after all, in this world, experts are as numerous as clouds, and divine dragons are hard to glimpse, their thoughts difficult to fathom," Dou Changfeng sighed, then as if he thought of something, spoke again:</p><p></p><p>"By the way, how is Yuyan's cultivation progressing now?"</p><p></p><p>Here is the full English translation of the Chinese excerpt:</p><p></p><p>"What's the matter?" </p><p></p><p>Mentioning his granddaughter, a trace of pride appeared on Qin Shenglong's face.</p><p></p><p>"She has already reached the Fifth Realm of martial artists, and has mastered about 70% of the Qin Family's sword techniques."</p><p></p><p>"Wonderful! To reach the Fifth Realm at such a young age is truly remarkable. </p><p></p><p>Recently, the Hanzhou region has produced a young sword prodigy named Park Jian-sheng! He has been challenging the top young sword talents across our Nine Provinces, and has already defeated dozens of them! Even the geniuses from the Imperial Capital University have fallen to his sword!"</p><p></p><p>Qin Shenglong's expression darkened.</p><p></p><p>"I've heard of Park Jian-sheng, but he's just a commoner from a small country. How could he be so strong? The sword geniuses from the Imperial Capital aren't weak either, are they?"</p><p></p><p>Du Changfeng sighed deeply.</p><p></p><p>"You know well that over the past two hundred years, our Nine Provinces have been repeatedly exploited by the other regions. They've intentionally lured spirit beasts into our lands, killing many of our top martial artists. The transmission of our martial arts has been disrupted countless times! </p><p></p><p>How many geniuses have been unable to find proper guidance? Sword cultivators have suffered the most casualties.</p><p></p><p>And in cultural exchanges between our nations, it shouldn't be a fight to the death. It should be a display of sword intent and techniques, with cultivation limited to the Fifth Realm. Yet this young man's sword intent has even impressed me."</p><p></p><p>"What?" </p><p></p><p>Qin Shenglong's pupils shrank, his expression one of shock. </p><p></p><p>Du Changfeng was an eminent figure - for him to speak so highly, just how powerful must Park Jian-sheng be?</p><p></p><p>Du Changfeng spoke meaningfully, "I've heard his next target is the Central Province. The Qin Family's sword techniques are renowned there, and it's closest to the Imperial Capital. I expect he'll come for your Qin Family first."</p><p></p><p>On the banks of the Jianghai City, before the massive sword mark...</p><p></p><p>Accompanied by a whistling sword wind, Qin Yuyan gradually sheathed her sword. </p><p></p><p>She was not a master, unable to release her spiritual energy to repel the sweat. </p><p></p><p>At this moment, the fragrant sweat had soaked her clothes, clinging tightly to her figure, accentuating her form.</p><p></p><p>She used her sleeve to wipe the sweat from her brow, gazing at the sword mark spanning the river, her expression somewhat pensive.</p><p></p><p>"Senior, I wonder if you are still in Jianghai City?"</p><p></p><p>Since that day she saw that sword strike, Qin Yuyan had been deeply shaken. </p><p></p><p>For the first time in her life, she felt a genuine interest in the martial dao. All these years, she had been like a marionette, cultivating the Qin Family's sword techniques at her grandfather's behest.</p><p></p><p>But she did not truly love the sword! </p><p></p><p>In fact, her spiritual nature was more akin to a blade than a sword.</p><p></p><p>Yet her grandfather insisted it was the sword!</p><p></p><p>So when she saw that sword strike, the suppression she had endured for years finally erupted.</p><p></p><p>She would defy her grandfather's orders and secretly learn the blade arts! Though she did not know what punishment awaited her.</p><p></p><p>But as long as she could cultivate the blade, she would fear no death!</p><p></p><p>At that moment, tens of kilometers downstream, a golden light suddenly flashed, exuding an awe-inspiring presence.</p><p></p><p>This caused Qin Yuyan's pupils to suddenly constrict.</p><p></p><p>"Such a powerful aura! Stronger than Grandfather's! Has Jianghai City produced such a figure? Could it be... the Senior?"</p><p></p><p>(PS: I didn't want to say this, but seeing all the criticism, I'll explain a bit.</p><p></p><p>The early supporting characters are all quite weak, so the early appearance of a Korean prodigy is just among these weaker ones. He can't represent the truly powerful geniuses that will come later. They praise Park Jian-sheng because they are all so weak themselves! The principle of the "general among dwarves" applies here.</p><p></p><p>The true geniuses of the Central Province will certainly not be introduced early on, much less come to deal with someone like Park Jian-sheng. </p><p></p><p>That's why he seems so overwhelmingly powerful now. And it's also revealed that Park has Central Province bloodline, which will be explained later.</p><p></p><p>In the end, they will all become subordinates to the protagonist.</p><p></p><p>True long-time readers should know that in xianxia novels, early geniuses often end up as cannon fodder later on. Don't judge the author's intentions based on just a few chapters. Is it the author's lack of reason, or the readers' irrationality?</p><p></p><p>I am a true patriotic female author, and I hope everyone won't read too much into this. </p><p></p><p>I personally despise Koreans and little brats.</p><p></p><p>As for those who spew anti-China rhetoric, they're either brainless, have problems in their heads, or are deliberately trying to smear.</p><p></p><p>I hope everyone will open their eyes a bit more!)</p><p></p><p>One update</p><p></p><p>(Chapter end)</p>

        <h1>Chapter 283</h1>
        <div class="content">
            <p>Here is the full English translation of the Chinese excerpt:</p><p></p><p>Tiger Star nodded.</p><p></p><p>"Brother Noel, I never expected that after hundreds of years, even you would be caught in this place."</p><p></p><p>Noel sighed.</p><p></p><p>"Alas! I've been unlucky! There's nothing to be done. Unfortunately, I don't have your strong character. I've brought shame to our beast clan.</p><p></p><p>Now, inspired by your spirit, I've decided to take you as an example, to reinvigorate myself. I will first appease the human race, consume more heavenly treasures and earthly resources, and secretly accumulate strength. One day when my cultivation is complete, I will surely break out of this place!"</p><p></p><p>Tiger Star nodded again.</p><p></p><p>"You're right. The human race cut off my arm, but I didn't eat their things. Instead, I let them gain more advantage. I should have eaten their things, and eaten them heartily."</p><p></p><p>Noel nodded.</p><p></p><p>"Correct! Hurry and eat! After eating these, your arm will quickly grow back. And your cultivation will also improve.</p><p></p><p>When you break through to the Supernal realm, that will be the time for us to break out of this seal!"</p><p></p><p>"Good!"</p><p></p><p>Tiger Star answered resolutely, then glanced at the Obsidian Jade beside him.</p><p></p><p>"Go get that Blood Lotus that Susan dropped over there! I won't leave a single one of these damned human things behind."</p><p></p><p>"Yes, Tiger God!" </p><p></p><p>Obsidian Jade respectfully went to retrieve the fallen Blood Lotus, along with the other Blood Lotuses in Susan's hand, and placed them all in the Tiger God's mouth.</p><p></p><p>Watching the Tiger God swallow them, the other beasts could not help but be moved to tears.</p><p></p><p>How strong the Tiger God is, able to bend and not break! For the great cause of the beast clan, he resolutely does not bow his head before the human race.</p><p></p><p>But to break through the human's seal, he endures humiliation and eats bitter fruit! The Tiger God is truly the model of the beasts of this age, deserving of having a monument erected and his heroic deeds widely celebrated.</p><p></p><p>So that all beasts will know of the Tiger God's valorous exploits!</p><p></p><p>On the surface, Ye Xiao returned directly to Jiang Chen's office.</p><p></p><p>Jiang Chen had already prepared a hot tea for Ye Xiao.</p><p></p><p>Normally, he wouldn't need to do this.</p><p></p><p>It's just that the strength Ye Xiao displayed was truly too impressive!</p><p></p><p>That astonishing sword strike left him with a sense of incomparable shock.</p><p></p><p>Now, he genuinely admires Ye Xiao, so he lowered his status as one of the Four Sages of the Nine Provinces to serve tea for his senior Ye Xiao.</p><p></p><p>"Ye Xiao, you've worked hard."</p><p></p><p>Ye Xiao replied indifferently:</p><p></p><p>"It's fine, the opponent was rather weak."</p><p></p><p>Jiang Chen's mouth couldn't help but twitch slightly.</p><p></p><p>This Ye Xiao is a bit too Versailles-like.</p><p></p><p>But oh well, who told him to be so powerful?</p><p></p><p>"When I just killed the opponent, I got their storage ring. There are seventeen dragon veins in total. I plan to extract the dragon qi from them and refine it, so I may need to go into seclusion for a period of time."</p><p></p><p>"Good! As long as it benefits you, go ahead and do it."</p><p></p><p>"As for the matters of the Star Battlefield?"</p><p></p><p>"This matter, I will try my best to contact. But I just called the Nine Provinces Alliance. They said the situation is not optimistic.</p><p></p><p>After each Seven-Star Convergence, it is a period when the beast clan's collective strength increases, so the frontlines are currently very tense.</p><p></p><p>The two Emperor Realm experts have been fighting on the frontlines without a chance to withdraw, so it may be a while before they can see you."</p><p></p><p>Ye Xiao nodded.</p><p></p><p>"No problem, the war takes priority. I'm not in a hurry for that bit of insight."</p><p></p><p>As long as Ye Xiao could obtain the final bit of insight, he could break through at any time, so there was no need to be too anxious.</p><p></p><p>The path of the martial dao requires effort, but one must not be hasty.</p><p></p><p>If one's mood is too anxious, it may bring negative consequences. By then, not only would he not achieve a breakthrough, he might even lead himself astray and end up going down the path of deviation.</p><p></p><p>Didn't Li Shuishui previously go down the path of deviation? At that time, his comprehension of the true meaning of the martial dao was not enough, and his soul cultivation was not strong enough, so he directly tried to break through, resulting in going down the path of deviation.</p><p></p><p>But he was also relatively fortunate.</p><p></p><p>First, his strength was not too great, so there were still many people who could suppress him and help him hold on for a while.</p><p></p><p>Second, in the end, he obtained the divine light illumination at the time of his ascension to the Divine Realm, but he himself would not have such an opportunity, and would not easily find someone stronger than himself to help him break through.</p><p></p><p>Sometimes, the one who defeats you may not be others, but yourself.</p><p></p><p>So Ye Xiao could not be too careless.</p><p></p><p>After bidding farewell to the Pavilion Master, Ye Xiao directly returned home and entered a state of seclusion.</p><p></p><p>Then, he extracted all the dragon qi from these seventeen dragon veins.</p><p></p><p>Blood Wing's strength was not strong, so he dared not concentrate all the dragon veins in a single storage ring, but instead placed them separately in seventeen spatial storage rings.</p><p></p><p>Ye Xiao's mind sank into one of the sealed spatial rings.</p><p></p><p>Roar! As soon as his consciousness entered, a thunderous roar directly assaulted his mind, trying to resist him.</p><p></p><p>Ye Xiao was calm and composed, directly...</p><p></p><p>Here is the full English translation of the Chinese excerpt:</p><p></p><p>With a single technique, Ye Xiao just extracted the imperial art technique - the Sound Technique - "Tiger Roar in the Mountains" from the star core of the Trembling Star Tiger.</p><p></p><p>A roar louder than a dragon vein echoed out! The powerful sound waves directly pressed the dragon veins firmly into the ground.</p><p></p><p>No matter how the dragon veins struggled, they could never break free from Ye Xiao's suppression.</p><p></p><p>Facing these Western dragon veins, Ye Xiao did not show the slightest bit of weakness.</p><p></p><p>Although the dragon veins are good for the human race, nurturing their martial dao cultivation, Ye Xiao had only received the favor of the Nine州dragon veins, not the Western dragon veins.</p><p></p><p>Moreover, over the years, the martial artists of the West have never been friendly towards the East.</p><p></p><p>They were able to cultivate successfully relying on the spiritual qi provided by these dragon veins, so from this perspective, these dragon veins were all accomplices.</p><p></p><p>Therefore, Ye Xiao ruthlessly extracted the dragon qi from them and absorbed it into his own body.</p><p></p><p>Then it was the turn of the next dragon vein, until he had completely devoured all the dragon qi from all the dragon veins.</p><p></p><p>These dragon veins were all from the West and the South, and since they were not within the Nine州borders, their appearances were somewhat unusual, with some even resembling the giant bats from movies.</p><p></p><p>Ye Xiao only extracted the dragon qi, without disturbing the pure spiritual qi within the dragon veins.</p><p></p><p>The combined power contained in these seventeen dragon veins was immeasurable. He could keep them as a reserve of spiritual qi for his future breakthroughs to higher realms.</p><p></p><p>This dragon qi he obtained was not as strong as half the dragon qi from the Long White Dragon Vein, but it was still a formidable force to be reckoned with.</p><p></p><p>Ye Xiao completely fused this dragon qi with the dragon qi already within him, feeling his dragon qi growing even more abundant.</p><p></p><p>It circulated within his meridians, but he did not know what its significance was.</p><p></p><p>The function of dragon qi is to refine one's divine blood and fully activate the divine blood within one's body.</p><p></p><p>But now, his divine blood was already fully activated, yet the dragon qi still wandered in his body without bringing any new changes or improvements to his strength.</p><p></p><p>Ye Xiao vaguely felt that the dragon qi must have an even more powerful function in the future, otherwise the senior of the Long White Dragon Vein would have simply taken back the dragon qi after helping him refine his body.</p><p></p><p>But the senior did not do so, which meant that Ye Xiao would still need the help of dragon qi to break through the Emperor Realm and beyond.</p><p></p><p>At this moment, Ye Xiao discovered a new problem - after obtaining the dragon qi, the fusion speed of the Golden Book's divine soul had become even faster.</p><p></p><p>The three Emperor-level martial arts had now fully fused into a brand-new martial art.</p><p></p><p>Divine Fist - Rift Splitting Fist!</p><p></p><p>From this moment on, the Great Annihilation Fist, the Profound Emperor Fist, and the Thunderous Emperor Fist would cease to exist, replaced by this new and stronger divine-level martial art.</p><p></p><p>At the same time, Ye Xiao also found that the Golden Book's absorption of spiritual qi had become much faster as well.</p><p></p><p>Could it be that the dragon qi is related to the divine soul?</p><p></p><p>Normal cultivators all need a divine soul. The presence or absence of a divine soul directly determines a person's cultivation limit.</p><p></p><p>Without a divine soul, the cultivation speed would not be fast, and one could at most reach the Posterior Heaven First or Second Rank, but no further.</p><p></p><p>With a divine soul, not only would the cultivation speed increase, but the cultivation limit would also be greatly raised.</p><p></p><p>However, in the early stages, the role of the divine soul is not that significant.</p><p></p><p>Like Ye Xiao, if it were not for the Golden Book's divine soul that could be used to absorb and fuse martial arts, it would only be a tool to assist in the absorption of spiritual qi, with a very small effect.</p><p></p><p>And the knowledge Ye Xiao has learned so far also points to one problem.</p><p></p><p>That is, the main function of the divine soul is after reaching the Divine Realm.</p><p></p><p>Before the Divine Realm, at the King Realm, the soul and the physical body have already achieved perfect fusion, no longer divided into physical body and soul.</p><p></p><p>But after the Divine Realm, the divine soul may just be beginning to shine.</p><p></p><p>And the dragon qi can indirectly enhance the divine soul. Perhaps in the King Realm stage, the focus is on refining the physical body and the soul.</p><p></p><p>Or one could say that before the King Realm, the human race is forging their physical body and soul.</p><p></p><p>When their body and soul have reached a certain strength, the next step is to start enhancing the divine soul.</p><p></p><p>It is very likely that ordinary people cannot wield or withstand the power of the divine soul's eruption.</p><p></p><p>Only when one's foundation is strong enough to bear the divine soul can one cultivate and improve the divine soul.</p><p></p><p>And the cultivation of the Emperor Realm is a process of tempering the divine soul?</p><p></p><p>This way, one can prepare for the next breakthrough to the Divine Realm?</p><p></p><p>Ye Xiao vaguely felt that he had grasped the key point, and his cultivation base inside began to subtly stir.</p><p></p><p>This made Ye Xiao jump in surprise. Could it be that he had already comprehended the secret to breaking through the Emperor Realm?</p><p></p><p>Was he about to start his breakthrough?</p>

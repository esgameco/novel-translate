        <h1>Chapter 74</h1>
        <div class="content">
            <p>Here is the full English translation of the Chinese excerpt:</p><p></p><p>"Unidentified life form?"</p><p></p><p>The group of big-nosed scientists in the command center couldn't help but raise their eyebrows, exchanging glances with each other, their faces filled with a hint of confusion.</p><p></p><p>"Could it be a star beast?"</p><p></p><p>"Unlikely, this is the star battlefield, star beasts couldn't have landed here casually."</p><p></p><p>"Then could it be a human warrior from the Nine States? This should be the star battlefield of the Nine States, right?"</p><p></p><p>Everyone looked towards the commander, who pondered for a moment before giving a slight smile.</p><p></p><p>"Whoever it is, since they've come, let's have them test our battle machines!"</p><p></p><p>The group's expressions changed slightly.</p><p></p><p>"Commander, is that really a good idea?"</p><p></p><p>"What's wrong with it? It's just a star beast, an alien star beast! As long as it's not one of our Meizou warriors, it's fine!"</p><p></p><p>The group exchanged mischievous smiles.</p><p></p><p>"Alright then! Immediately execute the battle order, annihilate the star beast!"</p><p></p><p>"Battle Plane No. 1 received."</p><p>"Battle Plane No. 2 received."</p><p>"Battle Plane No. 3 received."</p><p></p><p>The three battle planes, upon receiving the order, immediately rushed towards the figure at their maximum speed.</p><p></p><p>Ye Xiao, who was in the midst of practicing the Divine Intention Technique, suddenly felt a warning from the Taixuan Heavenly Might within him.</p><p></p><p>This left him somewhat startled.</p><p></p><p>"These are... battle planes?"</p><p></p><p>In the human's fight against star beasts, aside from cultivation, there are other ways to enhance themselves. </p><p></p><p>The two most famous methods are genetic technology and military technology.</p><p></p><p>Genetic technology involves unlocking the genes of star beasts and then applying them to human genes, thereby shortening the time for human advancement and rapidly producing high-level masters, although there are many serious side effects, the effects are indeed good.</p><p></p><p>Military technology, on the other hand, is the research on advanced weaponry, allowing many countries to create extremely powerful large-scale destructive weapons on the star beast battlefields, some of which can even rival the attacks of Sage Realm cultivators.</p><p></p><p>And judging from the flags on the battle planes, it seems to be the technologically most advanced Meizou.</p><p></p><p>Just as Ye Xiao was pondering, suddenly, six beams of light were fired from the enemy's battle planes.</p><p></p><p>These beams were compressed from ultra-high frequency lasers, and the Taixuan Heavenly Might instantly determined that their destructive power was no less than an early Sage Realm master's attack.</p><p></p><p>Moreover, the speed of these beams was extremely fast, and Ye Xiao hadn't initially thought that the other party would attack a human warrior, so he hadn't taken excessive precautions.</p><p></p><p>By the time he reacted, the enemy's beams had already reached him.</p><p></p><p>Ye Xiao instantly unleashed the Tyrannical Saber, and a saber beam slashed through the air, exploding the six beams in a dazzling display of sparks.</p><p></p><p>Boom, boom, boom...</p><p></p><p>The sky seemed to have burst into six brilliant fireworks.</p><p></p><p>Thick smoke rose, and Ye Xiao, who had not cultivated body refinement techniques and had not taken excessive precautions, sustained some light injuries under this sudden Sage Realm-level attack.</p><p></p><p>The Replenishing Technique activated, quickly healing his wounds, while his eyes turned ice-cold without a trace of warmth.</p><p></p><p>The other party's technological level was not low, they couldn't have failed to detect that he was a human warrior, yet they still attacked him decisively, clearly intending to use him as a target for practice.</p><p></p><p>This was unforgivable!</p><p></p><p>The three battle planes reported to the command center after the initial attack.</p><p></p><p>"The target has been eliminated, requesting further instructions."</p><p></p><p>The commander's face revealed a hint of disappointment, he had thought it was a big fish from the Nine States.</p><p></p><p>Killing that would have been somewhat challenging, but he didn't expect it to be just a small fry.</p><p></p><p>"Nevermind, come back."</p><p></p><p>"Understood!"</p><p></p><p>The battle planes were about to retreat when suddenly...</p><p></p><p>Here is the full English translation of the Chinese excerpt:</p><p></p><p>On the radar screen, the red waves appeared again. </p><p></p><p>"He's not dead! He's not dead! He has started to mobilize his spiritual energy. The radar feedback shows that the other party's spiritual energy fluctuation is that of a Grand Master! Request to launch another attack."</p><p></p><p>The commander's eyes lit up, finding it rather interesting.</p><p></p><p>"Approved."</p><p></p><p>As soon as the words left his mouth, the No. 1 fighter jet suddenly transmitted a message.</p><p></p><p>"The enemy has disappeared!"</p><p></p><p>The No. 2 fighter jet quickly issued an order.</p><p></p><p>"He hasn't disappeared, he's above you! His speed is very fast, your radar couldn't detect him. Quickly accelerate!"</p><p></p><p>The pilot of the No. 1 fighter jet felt a golden glow radiate from above, the earth-shattering pressure disrupting all the magnetic fields of his fighter.</p><p></p><p>Without time to look up, he left behind a final words.</p><p></p><p>"My God!"</p><p></p><p>Boom! In the next instant, a golden blade covered his fighter, directly causing it to explode.</p><p></p><p>"Damn it!"</p><p></p><p>The other two fighter jets immediately launched an attack towards the explosion center.</p><p></p><p>But the next second, one of the fighter jets suddenly exploded! It had been attacked by Ye Xiao.</p><p></p><p>"Damn it!"</p><p></p><p>The last Grandmaster-level pilot was terrified, no longer daring to stay. He opened the throttle to the max, trying to flee this airspace.</p><p></p><p>But before he could catch his breath, he saw a bright red dot on the screen rapidly approaching, its speed unbelievable!</p><p></p><p>"Oh my god, he's flying faster than me! Oh no!"</p><p></p><p>Boom! The next second, the last fighter jet was completely destroyed.</p><p></p><p>After destroying the three fighter jets, the air became silent.</p><p></p><p>Clearly, the other party had already left.</p><p></p><p>In the command room, all the scientists were collectively dumbfounded.</p><p></p><p>The commander, hands on his hips, pointed at the screen, his fingers trembling with anger.</p><p></p><p>"This is what you call fighter jets comparable to Grand Masters?"</p><p></p><p>A chubby scientist coughed lightly and said, "Perhaps the other party's combat power is even beyond Grand Masters."</p><p></p><p>"You mean Divine Masters? Don't tell me our radar technology is also fake, the most advanced radar in the entire Midwest, clearly tested him as a Grand Master!"</p><p></p><p>"Uh..."</p><p></p><p>The other person opened his mouth but ultimately said nothing.</p><p></p><p>"The R&D investment for this fighter jet has exceeded 20 billion US dollars, and with the rare alloy materials used, the three fighter jets cost a total of 40 billion US dollars! </p><p></p><p>Now they've been slashed one by one like rabbit kits, and the other party left unscathed.</p><p></p><p>We don't even know who the other party is! Every one of you here will be held responsible! Prepare to be charged! A bunch of idiots, fuck!"</p><p></p><p>On Ye Xiao's side, after destroying the three high-tech fighter jets, he quickly descended back to Jianghai City.</p><p></p><p>The Midwest's strength is formidable, with many high-level warriors. </p><p></p><p>After suffering losses, they might dispatch Grand Masters or even Divine Masters! He wasn't afraid, but fighting against such powerful opponents, it would be difficult to decide the outcome quickly.</p><p></p><p>If he attracted more people over, his identity would be exposed.</p><p></p><p>The hole would just keep getting bigger, there's no way it would lead to anything good.</p><p></p><p>One more update.</p><p></p><p>Originally posted this morning, but it was blocked. Now I've re-edited and reposted it.</p><p></p><p>Don't ask anything, the answer is peace!</p><p></p><p>(Chapter end)</p>

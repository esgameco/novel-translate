        <h1>Chapter 303</h1>
        <div class="content">
            <p>Here is the full English translation of the Chinese excerpt:</p><p></p><p>"Why is the Venerable One not sleeping so late at night?" </p><p></p><p>Jiang Chen shook his head, unsure whether to laugh or cry.</p><p></p><p>"Do you think I can sleep now? How many days has it been since you disappeared? Every day, I've been anxious, afraid that you went to the Star Battlefield alone.</p><p></p><p>That place is extremely dangerous, and your current strength is not enough. What if you encounter some danger? What would we do then?"</p><p></p><p>Ye Xiao's heart warmed. Although Jiang Chen's strength was no longer as great as his own, as an elder, his concern for him was still touching.</p><p></p><p>"Please don't worry, Senior Xuanwu. I'm still young and I don't want to die. If I encounter any trouble, I will be careful to avoid it."</p><p></p><p>Jiang Chen nodded.</p><p></p><p>"The important thing is that you can return safely, and that's the best outcome. It seems the heavens have blessed you."</p><p></p><p>After a pause, he spoke again:</p><p></p><p>"I have something very important to tell you, and it's great news for you."</p><p></p><p>Ye Xiao was slightly puzzled.</p><p></p><p>"What is this great news?"</p><p></p><p>Jiang Chen smiled mysteriously.</p><p></p><p>"Guess?"</p><p></p><p>"I can't guess."</p><p></p><p>When it came to friends, Ye Xiao didn't like to use spiritual power to scan them, as he wanted to give them enough respect and privacy.</p><p></p><p>"Alright, then I'll tell you. You've hit the jackpot! The Azure Dragon wants to challenge you, using his Dao Insights to help you break through."</p><p></p><p>After understanding the situation, Ye Xiao was stunned.</p><p></p><p>The number one on the Dragon Ranking, the Sword Immortal Azure Dragon, actually wants to challenge him! He wants to use his own sword insights to help him improve? This not only shocked Ye Xiao, but also made him admire the elder.</p><p></p><p>After all, he is an old senior of the Nine Realms, willing to use himself as a stepping stone to help cultivate a powerful Emperor Realm expert for the Nine Realms. </p><p></p><p>This mentality is something Ye Xiao could never achieve himself.</p><p></p><p>One must know that in a Dao confrontation, if you lose, it will have a huge impact on your mindset. </p><p></p><p>Once defeated, one's entire Dao cultivation may stagnate from then on.</p><p></p><p>It's like a person who has never been seriously ill - they don't truly appreciate good health. But after a major illness, they will have an unprecedented longing for health.</p><p></p><p>However, Ye Xiao has already successfully broken through to the Emperor Realm, so he no longer needs the other's help. But since the other has this intention, he can repay him with a stroke of good fortune and lend him a hand.</p><p></p><p>Isn't it through this mutual support that the human race of the Nine Realms has reached this point today?</p><p></p><p>"This news is indeed too important." Ye Xiao sighed in agreement with Jiang Chen.</p><p></p><p>Jiang Chen put away his smile, his face serious as he spoke:</p><p></p><p>"He has already said that the time will be in half a month. He wants to use his Dao insights to help you break through the last layer, so that you can smoothly enter the Emperor Realm.</p><p></p><p>You must be prepared, this is a rare and precious opportunity for you."</p><p></p><p>Ye Xiao shook his head.</p><p></p><p>"The time is too long, I'm afraid it won't work. This time I went out, I obtained some very important news, which is extremely important for the Nine Realms, even for the entire human race."</p><p></p><p>"What news?"</p><p></p><p>Ye Xiao took a deep breath, his face grave:</p><p></p><p>"The Beast Calamity, it will start in at most one month."</p><p></p><p>Boom! This sentence was like a heavy bomb exploding in Jiang Chen's mind.</p><p></p><p>The Beast Calamity, it's actually going to start in just one month?</p><p></p><p>According to their previous plan, it shouldn't have started for at least another three years.</p><p></p><p>But now it's suddenly coming so fast, catching them completely off guard. The human race all over the world probably hasn't had time to prepare yet.</p><p></p><p>"Gulp."</p><p></p><p>Jiang Chen swallowed hard, finding it hard to believe: "Ye Xiao, where did you get this news from?"</p><p></p><p>"It's a long story, difficult to explain in a short time. But I can assure you the news is true.</p><p></p><p>Additionally, this time the Beast Spirits have gathered twelve Quasi-Emperor Realm super powerhouses. And the Godly Beast experts comparable to the Human Realm's King Realm are countless in number.</p><p></p><p>I hope you all can prepare early."</p><p></p><p>Boom! This was another huge bomb exploding in Jiang Chen's mind, and this time the impact was even greater, making his head feel like it could barely withstand it, his body even involuntarily taking a few steps back.</p><p></p><p>"Ye Xiao, is this intelligence also true?"</p><p></p><p>Ye Xiao couldn't help but laugh bitterly.</p><p></p><p>"Do you think I have any reason to fabricate false intelligence to trick you? What benefit would that bring me?"</p><p></p><p>Jiang Chen waved his hand.</p><p></p><p>"I don't mean to doubt you. I just can't quite accept this information yet."</p><p></p><p>Twelve Quasi-Emperor Realm experts!</p><p></p><p>And that countless number of King Realm powerhouses.</p><p></p><p>How much pressure would that add up to?</p><p></p><p>The entire human race currently only has six Emperor Realm experts.</p><p></p><p>And there are only dozens of King Realm experts, including all the high-level combat forces from the Star Battlefield and the Human Realm.</p><p></p><p>Even so, they are still far inferior to the Beast Spirits.</p><p></p><p>"Ye Xiao, I must hurry and report this matter, and notify the entire human race. This won't do, we have to come up with a plan!"</p><p></p><p>Here is the full English translation of the Chinese excerpt:</p><p></p><p>"This matter may lead the entire human race into a dire situation." </p><p></p><p>Ye Xiao nodded.</p><p></p><p>"Senior, please go and attend to your matters." As soon as he finished speaking, Jiang Chen turned and left.</p><p></p><p>He dared not delay even a moment. This matter was of great importance, concerning the survival and future of all human beings in the world. He could not be careless about it at all.</p><p></p><p>Ye Xiao then returned to his breeding ground and released all the star beasts he had just obtained in the Silver Fox Valley.</p><p></p><p>He had already scanned their star cores and extracted the cultivation techniques from them.</p><p></p><p>The cultivation techniques were not many, and some of them overlapped with the ones he already had.</p><p></p><p>Currently, the usable cultivation techniques he had obtained were two.</p><p></p><p>One was a palm technique - the Immovable King! Ye Xiao had previously already possessed two imperial-level palm techniques - the Tathagata Divine Palm and the Trembling Star Palm. Now with this new one, he could synthesize a divine-level palm technique.</p><p></p><p>Ye Xiao now possessed several divine techniques:</p><p>- Sword Technique: Opening the Heavens</p><p>- Fist Technique: Splitting the Void Fist</p><p>- Heart Cultivation Technique: Nine Turning Cyan Lotus Sutra</p><p>- Healing Divine Technique: Eternal Life Sutra</p><p>- Body Technique: Yin-Yang Escape Technique</p><p></p><p>Next, after refining the Immovable King to the great perfection realm, he would be able to synthesize another brand new divine technique.</p><p></p><p>The more divine techniques he had, the more means of self-preservation he would possess.</p><p></p><p>The other unique cultivation technique he obtained was an imperial-level technique extracted from the star core of the Flower Deity Zhu Xinyu. It was called the Tempering the Heart Technique - Heart of Granite.</p><p></p><p>Flower Deity Zhu Xinyu was originally a spiritual flower that had cultivated for thousands of years before becoming a star beast. This left Ye Xiao quite surprised that he would possess such a strange technique.</p><p></p><p>The Tempering the Heart Technique was not a heart cultivation technique, but a method to cultivate one's mental state. This was a type of cultivation technique Ye Xiao had never seen before.</p><p></p><p>It suddenly occurred to Ye Xiao that this technique might be the missing link between the Tempering the Soul Technique and the Tempering the Body Technique, allowing him to synthesize them into a divine technique. After all, those two techniques could be fused together, but they were still missing one type.</p><p></p><p>Zhu Xinyu, having endured wind and rain for thousands of years, only then awakened his spiritual awareness, and then spent another thousand years cultivating his spiritual body, before finally succeeding after six thousand years of arduous cultivation to reach the realm of a divine beast.</p><p></p><p>The hardships he experienced on this path, only he himself could truly understand. This Tempering the Heart Technique was likely a necessity for him.</p><p></p><p>Ye Xiao recorded this technique into his Divine Book of the Spirit.</p><p></p><p>Sure enough, it was perfectly positioned between the Tempering the Body Technique and the Tempering the Soul Technique, indicating that these three techniques could indeed be fused into a divine technique.</p><p></p><p>This was good news for Ye Xiao, as it solved one of his doubts. And once they were combined, it would surely strengthen his physique and spirit even further.</p><p></p><p>After completing all this, Ye Xiao arrived at his breeding ground. But as soon as he got there, he was taken aback by the scene before him.</p><p></p><p>This was no longer a breeding ground, but more like a casual mahjong hall. The star beasts had gathered together to play mahjong!</p><p></p><p>Where did they get the mahjong table and tiles from? And what happened to Noel Fist's tentacles? Several of them were broken off, with the Trembling Star Tiger gnawing on them. Had he lost them in a mahjong game?</p><p></p><p>"Master has arrived!" The star beasts quickly stood up and lined up to welcome him.</p><p></p><p>Before Ye Xiao could say anything, the star beasts grinned.</p><p></p><p>"Master, we were so bored here, so Illusion Supervisor prepared a mahjong table for us. You don't mind, do you? We've been dutifully providing our offerings every day."</p><p></p><p>"Yes, yes, we traded the mahjong and table with Illusion Supervisor using our eggs, milk, and fish meat."</p><p></p><p>Ye Xiao's mouth twitched slightly. This foolish cat actually had the brain to do some small business deals.</p><p></p><p>Oh well, let them be. As long as the star beasts weren't listless and depressed all the time, their meat quality would be better.</p><p></p><p>Sighing, Ye Xiao then took out a batch of new star beasts from his spatial ring.</p><p></p><p>"Starting today, I've brought you some new companions."</p>

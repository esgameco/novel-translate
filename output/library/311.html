        <h1>Chapter 311</h1>
        <div class="content">
            <p>Here is the full English translation of the Chinese excerpt:</p><p></p><p>The powerful techniques of the Deicide Art, combined with Ye Xiao's strength, were enough to easily unleash attacks that surpassed his current cultivation level.</p><p></p><p>At this point, Ye Xiao had gathered all the divine arts - the Opening of the Heavens, the Falling God Palm, the Splitting Star Fist, the Eternal Life Technique, the Divine Body of the Great Vehicle, the Yin-Yang Escape Art, and the Nine Revolutions of the Azure Lotus Technique.</p><p></p><p>He had mastered sword techniques, palm techniques, fist techniques, healing, body tempering, movement techniques, and mental cultivation techniques.</p><p></p><p>Seeing all these divine-level cultivation methods, Ye Xiao couldn't help but have a slight smile on his face, as his mood had improved significantly.</p><p></p><p>These cultivation methods covered various aspects such as attack, endurance, healing, and defense.</p><p></p><p>They should be sufficient to allow him to perfectly handle the upcoming beast disaster.</p><p></p><p>Next, he just needed to eat a bit more beast meat every day and replenish his vital energy to further enhance his cultivation.</p><p></p><p>Although Ye Xiao had already stepped into the Emperor Realm, he had just barely entered it and only possessed the strength of one dragon.</p><p></p><p>The Tyrant King had previously mentioned that in order to successfully break through to the Divine Realm, one must cultivate 108 dragon qi to temper the divine soul and achieve the perfect fusion of the divine soul and physical body.</p><p></p><p>It was a long and arduous task!</p><p></p><p>In the following period, Ye Xiao devoted himself to fully exploring the Eye Technique, an extremely esoteric skill that had always piqued his interest.</p><p></p><p>It could be used to secretly harm others, providing a useful trick when facing enemies he couldn't defeat in direct combat.</p><p></p><p>Previously, when he slew the Trembling Star Tiger, he had obtained two Emperor-level techniques - the Trembling Star Palm, a relatively common technique, and the extremely esoteric Commanding Voice Art - the Tiger's Roar in the Mountain Forest, an attack using sound as the means of assault.</p><p></p><p>These two unique techniques were highly valued by Ye Xiao.</p><p></p><p>They were both extremely esoteric, making them very convenient for secretly harming others.</p><p></p><p>After fifteen days of diligent effort, Ye Xiao finally fully refined the last Eye Technique he had been yearning for - the Grand Ultimate True Eye!</p><p></p><p>When activated, his pupils would display a miniature Taiji diagram.</p><p></p><p>It possessed four-in-one abilities: detection, illusion, attack, and defense.</p><p></p><p>Of course, it was currently only an Emperor-level technique and was naturally inferior to Ye Xiao's Divine Arts, but it still possessed formidable power. Moreover, it could be fused with other Eye Techniques in the future to form a Divine Art, making it even more terrifying.</p><p></p><p>The unfortunate part was that Ye Xiao did not have a natural divine eye.</p><p></p><p>He didn't know if he would ever encounter a beast with eye techniques that he could absorb the star core and eyes from to refine a divine eye.</p><p></p><p>Apart from that, the only other way to obtain a divine eye was to pluck out the eyes of someone else who possessed eye techniques and replace his own eyes with them.</p><p></p><p>However, this was something Ye Xiao could not bring himself to do. He could take others' divine eyes, but the idea of implanting them in himself felt utterly repulsive to him.</p><p></p><p>In these recent days, in response to the summons of the Nine Provinces Alliance, cultivators from all over the country had been flocking to the five regions Ye Xiao had previously designated. The city of Jianghai had also seen an influx of people.</p><p></p><p>The streets and alleys were filled with small tents, and the open spaces on both sides of Ye Xiao's residence were completely occupied by them.</p><p></p><p>If it weren't for the protective array around Ye Xiao's home, it might have been "visited" by certain people multiple times.</p><p></p><p>At first, there weren't many people staying here, as this area was still considered the outskirts and lacked conveniences.</p><p></p><p>But one day, when Ye Xiao went out from his home, he was spotted by a young lady who had come to seek refuge, and she took a photo and posted it on her social media. From then on, the tents around Ye Xiao's residence just kept increasing day by day.</p><p></p><p>There were all kinds of pink and cartoon-themed tents, which made Ye Xiao feel quite exasperated.</p><p></p><p>What was even more exasperating was that since many women were living here, they shamelessly dressed very lightly. Even though it was already late autumn, Ye Xiao would sometimes see a few bare legs without any stockings when he went out.</p><p></p><p>Even worse, some would come knocking on his door late at night, wearing very "revealing" outfits - short skirts, black stockings, and high heels - claiming they wanted to charge their phones or use the restroom. But Ye Xiao knew very well their true intentions.</p><p></p><p>These women, with their heavily made-up faces that looked like needles, thought they were incredibly beautiful, but to Ye Xiao, they were just a bunch of vixens, which made him feel quite uncomfortable.</p><p></p><p>In response, Ye Xiao directly used an array to completely shield his courtyard, and then carrying the pots of heavenly materials and earthly treasures he had grown, he fled to the library, where he had his own private room.</p><p></p><p>And just after Ye Xiao had moved to the library, Ning Yutian and Youwei came that very night.</p><p></p><p>"Master!" Ning Yutian's sudden appearance made Ye Xiao's brows furrow slightly, as he could sense that Ning Yutian's expression was not quite right.</p><p></p><p>Ye Xiao generally did not use spiritual power to scan his close friends, as a way of respecting them.</p><p></p><p>"Something serious has happened."</p><p></p><p>"Slowly tell me about it."</p><p></p><p>Ye Xiao raised his hand and sent a stream of spiritual energy to help Ning Yutian relax a bit.</p><p></p><p>Although Ye Xiao had already entered the King Realm, his speed was still no match for Ning Yutian's. Ning Yutian could not possibly come to the human realm as easily as Ye Xiao could from the Silver Fox Clan.</p><p></p><p>On his way here, he must have encountered a few exceptional experts and gotten entangled with them.</p><p></p><p>Here is the full English translation of the Chinese novel excerpt:</p><p></p><p>"The Seven Star Cluster has opened."</p><p></p><p>Ye Xiao was stunned, his expression becoming more serious.</p><p></p><p>"How could the Seven Star Cluster have opened? Didn't it just open recently?"</p><p></p><p>Ning Yuthen shook his head.</p><p></p><p>"I don't know either. From the direction of the human realm, we still can't see the formation of the Seven Star Cluster. I only discovered it in the direction of the Silver Fox Valley. </p><p></p><p>My grandmother speculates that there is only one existence in the entire starry sky that can trigger the opening of the Seven Star Cluster."</p><p></p><p>"The God Clan?"</p><p></p><p>"Yes! The God Clan!"</p><p></p><p>Ning Yuthen's answer made Ye Xiao's gaze waver.</p><p></p><p>No wonder he had felt a bit unsettled in the past few days - it turned out someone was manipulating the opening of the Seven Star Cluster from behind the scenes. It seems the war between the Star Beasts and the human race was far more than just a struggle for the God Blood. There was an even more powerful hidden hand manipulating everything.</p><p></p><p>And it was an extremely formidable existence.</p><p></p><p>Just then, the alarm sirens of the entire Jianghai City suddenly rang out.</p><p></p><p>"Wooâ€”!"</p><p></p><p>Ye Xiao couldn't help but furrow his brows.</p><p></p><p>Ning Yuthen's expression also turned grave.</p><p></p><p>"What's going on? Why did the alarm suddenly sound?"</p><p></p><p>Ye Xiao looked up at the sky, where seven blood-red stars had already formed a straight line. He let out a long sigh and said solemnly:</p><p></p><p>"The Seven Star Cluster has opened. If I'm not mistaken, the Beast Calamity has begun."</p><p></p><p>At this moment, a deafening thunderous roar came from the sky above, and countless beams of light, like a meteor shower, could be seen falling from the atmosphere.</p><p></p><p>The Beast Calamity had begun!</p><p></p><p>"How could it be so fast?" Ning Yuthen exclaimed in shock.</p><p></p><p>Youwei speculated:</p><p></p><p>"Our speed is simply too slow compared to Senior Ye. On the way here, we encountered several forces of Star Beasts and the human race, wasting too much time. And the Seven Star Cluster was manipulated by someone behind the scenes, so its formation would be faster than a natural one.</p><p></p><p>So it's not surprising that the Seven Star Cluster has formed again."</p><p></p><p>"Damn it! They said I was useless, if only I had been a bit faster. Then I could have notified the authorities earlier, and they could have prepared sooner."</p><p></p><p>Ye Xiao shook his head.</p><p></p><p>"Don't worry, the necessary preparations have already been made. It's just that the re-formation of the Seven Star Cluster is something I didn't anticipate."</p><p></p><p>But even if he had anticipated it, it wouldn't have made a difference.</p><p></p><p>His current strength was limited, and he couldn't deploy even more powerful formations, nor could he single-handedly annihilate all the enemies.</p><p></p><p>This was the most realistic problem.</p><p></p><p>"So what do we do now?"</p><p></p><p>"Wait!"</p><p></p><p>"Wait?"</p><p></p><p>"Yes, wait for them to descend."</p><p></p><p>The Star Beasts were coming with overwhelming force, and the human race's resources were limited. </p><p></p><p>They couldn't just charge at them head-on, so they could only wait for the Star Beasts to come down and ambush them.</p><p></p><p>The defensive formations responsible for protecting the city had already been activated, and all the offensive formations were also ready.</p><p></p><p>Those offensive formations could unleash destructive attacks like spiritual energy cannons.</p><p></p><p>Now, the Nine States had been divided into five major regions, with all the human race's population of over 10 billion people distributed among these five regions.</p><p></p><p>Enough to withstand the first wave of the attack.</p><p></p><p>The library's big screen began playing news footage of the Star Beast invasion.</p><p></p><p>The Nine States were doing alright, as they had prepared early, and with Ye Xiao's formations, they were all on high alert, waiting for the Star Beasts' arrival.</p><p></p><p>But the other states, especially those represented by the American States and their allies, had already descended into panic.</p><p></p><p>This group had been the most vocal online, mocking the Nine States and spreading false rumors about the Star Beasts' arrival.</p><p></p><p>So many of them had no defensive awareness at all. Now, suddenly confronted with the real Star Beasts, they had descended into complete chaos, without any semblance of order.</p><p></p><p>But Ye Xiao had no time to worry about these foolish keyboard warriors, because at this moment, the Star Beasts had arrived in the skies above the Nine States.</p><p></p><p>Countless massive spiritual energy ships descended from the starry sky, crashing down like meteors.</p><p></p><p>They even landed directly over the cities, and the spiritual energy cannons on the ships immediately began their attacks.</p><p></p><p>Countless beams of light, like a meteor shower, bombarded the defensive formations above the city.</p><p></p><p>Fortunately, with Ye Xiao's Diabolical Heavenly Formation, those light beams could only stir up ripples on the formations, before disappearing without a trace.</p><p></p><p>The countless falling light beams formed a beautiful scene, like a gentle rain falling from the sky.</p><p></p><p>The ignorant children even began cheering and celebrating.</p><p></p><p>"Wow! Such a beautiful rain!"</p><p>"Dad, mom, look, it's a golden rain!"</p><p></p><p>City Lord Changfeng of Jianghai City, watching the peaceful scene outside, couldn't help but sigh repeatedly.</p><p></p><p>On the screens in his office, he could see the disastrous situations the other states were facing against the Star Beasts.</p><p></p><p>This is the first update, 3,000 words.</p><p></p><p>Please recommend and vote for monthly tickets.</p><p>Definitely won't torture the protagonist, how could an uplifting story torture the protagonist?</p><p></p><p>(Chapter end)</p>

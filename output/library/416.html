        <h1>Chapter 416</h1>
        <div class="content">
            <p>Here is my translation of the Chinese excerpt you provided:</p><p></p><p>"North Hall Strategy: '.`!'</p><p></p><p>'How strange, have I been practicing my eyes too much lately and gotten a bit muddled? I feel like I'm seeing a pile of divine weapons. Haha haha..'</p><p></p><p>North Hall Strategy laughed as he looked at Ye Xiao, but found that Ye Xiao's expression was very calm, without the slightest change.</p><p></p><p>His smile gradually faded, and then he immersed his spiritual sense back into the spatial ring again. </p><p></p><p>The next moment, his body started to tremble.</p><p></p><p>'Ye Xiao...this...this...this...I couldn't have seen wrong, right? I feel like my brain shouldn't be that muddled! You actually gave me a pile of divine weapons.'</p><p></p><p>After saying this, he suddenly seemed to remember something and immediately covered his mouth.</p><p></p><p>Then he carefully looked left and right, took a deep breath, and tried to calm his excited emotions, then said softly:</p><p></p><p>'Ye Xiao, are you joking with me? How can you give me so many important things? </p><p></p><p>We went to excavate the divine tomb in the past to compete for some resources. If you give us so many things, it feels like we're going out to send resources to others.'</p><p></p><p>Ye Xiao smiled.</p><p></p><p>'It's not that exaggerated, the main thing is just wanting to protect you all a bit better, so that you don't run into any trouble and get hurt, that would truly be a loss.'</p><p></p><p>'But these are too precious, right? I can't take these, you should take them back.'</p><p></p><p>As he spoke, North Hall Strategy tried to stuff the things back into Ye Xiao's hand.</p><p></p><p>But Ye Xiao pushed them back and shook his head with a smile.</p><p></p><p>'These things are for you to use to protect your lives. Now that news of the Ancient Divine Kingdom has appeared, it will definitely attract many powerful experts to the Canglan Star Realm. I can't guarantee that you won't encounter them.</p><p></p><p>Furthermore, if you take these things with you, you'll also be able to protect yourselves in critical moments. If you don't take these things and just go to the starry sky, I'm also quite worried, how could you cultivate better?'</p><p></p><p>North Hall Strategy was still a bit unwilling to accept it.</p><p></p><p>'But you're giving us such good things. What will you use as weapons?'</p><p></p><p>Ye Xiao waved his hand.</p><p></p><p>'My strength is quite strong, and I have many techniques, I can use anything. The good things should be given to you first.'</p><p></p><p>'Ye Xiao!'</p><p></p><p>In this moment, North Hall Strategy felt that his eyes couldn't help but sting a bit.</p><p></p><p>What a touching scene this was!</p><p></p><p>These were things that Ye Xiao had painstakingly refined himself.</p><p></p><p>But he didn't use a single one himself, and instead gave them all to them, using inferior ones himself.</p><p></p><p>What a kind-hearted character? What a good child?</p><p></p><p>At this moment, North Hall Strategy suddenly felt that their care and dedication to Ye Xiao all along was worth it!</p><p></p><p>'I won't say anything else, just rest assured! We will work hard to find more resources, and also work hard to find the secrets left behind by our ancestors!</p><p></p><p>Otherwise, I feel we would all be unworthy of your kindness.'</p><p></p><p>'There's no need to be so dramatic.'</p><p></p><p>'Alright, Ye Xiao, I won't say anything more. Saying more would just make us seem sentimental. Just wait for our good news!'</p><p></p><p>Ye Xiao nodded, then spoke up:</p><p></p><p>'When you go back, remember to collect all of your people's divine blood and a strand of their divine souls.</p><p></p><p>That way, if you are killed, I can help revive you on this side.'</p><p></p><p>'Okay! I'll start preparing this as soon as I get back.'</p><p></p><p>North Hall Strategy took his leave.</p><p></p><p>Ye Xiao then began to ponder alone.</p><p></p><p>'The news that has been unearthed is becoming more and more. Looking at the current situation, my time is becoming more and more pressing. It seems I should strive to quickly improve my strength.</p><p></p><p>But what method should I use to quickly improve my strength?'</p><p></p><p>Ye Xiao thought for a moment, then spoke up:</p><p></p><p>'If only I could get another divine king. Of course, it would be best if it was a divine king whose cultivation hasn't fully recovered yet, and is convenient for me to slay, with thick blood! Perfect!'</p><p></p><p>Unfortunately, he also knew that this was just his own random thoughts.</p><p></p><p>Divine kings were already very hard to find, let alone finding those who hadn't surpassed him. </p><p></p><p>After all, true divine kings wouldn't come here, and even if they did, he couldn't defeat them.</p><p></p><p>Those divine kings who were injured and about to perish would even less likely come here.</p><p></p><p>It's best to hurry up and read books.</p><p></p><p>In a certain desolate star island in the starry sky, two corpses lay quietly on the ground, and in front of them was a figure that looked extremely young, wearing a jade thumb ring.</p><p></p><p>It was Su Chen!</p><p></p><p>'Rise!'</p><p></p><p>Su Chen lightly shouted, and the two corpses soon floated up.</p><p></p><p>He then poured two bottles of divine blood that he had already collected and prepared into their Baihui acupoints.</p><p></p><p>The blood qi diffused, and the fresh blood actually flowed into their nostrils.</p><p></p><p>After a moment, they opened their eyes, with a demonic and bizarre light shining, and their aura quickly rose to the level of Slay God Realm Fifth Realm.</p><p></p><p>'Welcome back, Senior Divine King and Senior Thunder King! It's a pleasure to have you return to this world!'</p><p></p><p>After being revived, the two looked..."</p><p></p><p>Here is the full English translation of the Chinese excerpt:</p><p></p><p>Turning to the present Su Chen, he raised his eyebrows slightly, with a puzzled look in his eyes.</p><p></p><p>"Who are you? How dare you revive us?"</p><p></p><p>Su Chen smiled slightly.</p><p></p><p>"I'm here to help you two seniors. At the moment, the news that the Canglan Star Domain was once the Ancient God Realm will soon be spread. </p><p></p><p>Many from the God Clan will come here, including Godking realm experts! For this reason, I specifically risked taking your bodies from the Alliance of a Hundred Tribes and reviving you two seniors.</p><p></p><p>I hope we can work together to achieve great things!"</p><p></p><p>The two looked at each other and then coldly smiled.</p><p></p><p>"What are you? How dare you think you can work with us to achieve great things?"</p><p></p><p>Su Chen did not get angry, and still smiled cheerfully:</p><p></p><p>"Senior, please don't be angry. It's true that with my identity, I naturally don't have the qualifications to work together with you two seniors.</p><p></p><p>But don't forget, you two seniors, this is no longer the Ancient God Realm of the ancient times.</p><p></p><p>Here, I know more about the surroundings and the powerful experts than you two.</p><p></p><p>Although you two are very strong, both at the Godking realm, your cultivation has not yet fully recovered after just being revived.</p><p></p><p>I personally think you still need a guide."</p><p></p><p>Shifang Wang and Leiting Wang snorted.</p><p></p><p>"It seems that since you revived us, we'll give you a chance to cooperate with us.</p><p></p><p>But be mindful of your identity, don't overstep, otherwise we two will kill you."</p><p></p><p>Su Chen nodded and then spoke:</p><p></p><p>"Senior, now that you two have been successfully revived! But Alpha Wang and Yanlong Wang have not yet been revived.</p><p></p><p>I wonder if you two seniors can go and find those two seniors. If we can also get the help of those two experts, our future will be more advantageous."</p><p></p><p>"Not bad, you're right. We should go rescue the other two.</p><p></p><p>Where are Alpha and Yanlong?"</p><p></p><p>"According to the seniors, they are in a nearby human world. Do you want me to use my spies to find their location?"</p><p></p><p>"No need. The coffins we are connected to can sense each other, we can find them ourselves."</p><p></p><p>"Then I'll leave it to the seniors."</p><p></p><p>As Su Chen's words fell, the two disappeared from the spot.</p><p></p><p>Su Chen looked towards the human world, clenching his fists tightly, his eyes filled with murderous intent.</p><p></p><p>What he hated most in his life was when others didn't respect him.</p><p></p><p>Originally, he should have been the pride of the Su family.</p><p></p><p>But due to an accident while helping the family, his whole body was disabled.</p><p></p><p>From then on, he was looked down upon and bullied in the entire Su family.</p><p></p><p>The attitude of Shifang Wang and Leiting Wang just now made his heart fill with murderous intent, almost wanting to immediately strike and kill the two.</p><p></p><p>But he knew he couldn't! To overthrow the Su family, he needed enough strength and power.</p><p></p><p>Relying on himself alone was too difficult!</p><p></p><p>The jade ring on his hand emitted a faint green light, and the light flashed, flowing along Su Chen's meridians in a big cycle.</p><p></p><p>Soon, his anger was calmed down.</p><p></p><p>"Chenchen! Don't let anger control your will. You must learn to control your emotions.</p><p></p><p>They can just curse a few words. When you become a GodEmperor in the future, they will be just ants to you."</p><p></p><p>Su Chen took a deep breath and calmed his anger.</p><p></p><p>"I understand what the Master said. Don't worry, I'm just talking, I know what I should and shouldn't do."</p><p></p><p>"That's good. Remember, as long as it can make you stronger, even if it's a pile of shit, it's still a delicacy.</p><p></p><p>Indulging in momentary courage will never achieve great things."</p><p></p><p>Shifang Wang and Leiting Wang were very fast, and in the blink of an eye they arrived in the human world and came to the sky above Jianghai City.</p><p></p><p>"It should be in this city. I can feel Alpha's coffin's connection.</p><p></p><p>But it seems a bit strange. Why can't I sense Yanlong's coffin? And why are the auras of Alpha and Yanlong almost completely gone?"</p><p></p><p>"Maybe something unexpected happened. But there's no need to worry too much. They are both geniuses, the trash down there can't possibly deal with them."</p><p></p><p>"Go down and find some people to search for their spiritual power, see if we can find any clues."</p><p></p><p>As the words fell, the two quickly descended to the ground.</p><p></p><p>At this time, Ye Xiao had just walked out of the library after getting off work.</p><p></p><p>He had just stepped out of the door when two figures appeared in front of the square.</p><p></p><p>Ye Xiao: "Wow!"</p><p></p><p>Well, this is really getting what you want!</p><p></p><p>Could it be that his golden finger is not a golden book?</p><p></p><p>One update, three thousand words.</p><p></p><p>Please recommend votes and monthly votes. </p><p></p><p>Thank you to book friends Cao Huang Feng Wuyu, book friend Yue Yu Dong, book friend Wulong Xiaofeng, and book friend Bu Xiuxian Jiu Hui Si for the rewards, thank you very much.</p><p></p><p>(This chapter is complete)</p>

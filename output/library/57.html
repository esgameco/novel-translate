        <h1>Chapter 57</h1>
        <div class="content">
            <p>Here is the full English translation of the Chinese excerpt:</p><p></p><p>"It's a pity. By the time we met you, we had already left a spiritual imprint on you."</p><p></p><p>The muscular man also approached from the other direction, and the two of them surrounded Ning Yuhen, blocking him from the front and back.</p><p></p><p>Ning Yuhen's heart suddenly turned cold.</p><p></p><p>He never expected that the other party had already left a spiritual imprint on him.</p><p></p><p>This is disastrous.</p><p></p><p>The two opponents were closing in step by step. Ning Yuhen gritted his teeth, and after a fierce mental struggle, he stomped his foot and his body transformed into an arrow released from the bowstring, instantly rushing towards the greasy fatty.</p><p></p><p>"Ignorant of your own mortality."</p><p></p><p>The greasy fatty sneered coldly, stomping his foot, and with a tremendous force, instantly shattered the cement in front of him, raising a huge cement slab to block himself.</p><p></p><p>But Ning Yuhen did not retreat an inch, coming before the fatty and punching the cement slab.</p><p></p><p>Boom! Accompanied by a violent explosion, the cement slab was shattered.</p><p></p><p>Ning Yuhen's knuckles and arms were also shattered by the violent impact, causing his face to twist and twitch in excruciating pain.</p><p></p><p>But he immediately activated his healing art, repairing his arms at the fastest speed.</p><p></p><p>The next moment, Ning Yuhen's arm slammed into the fatty's body.</p><p></p><p>The fist hit the fatty's fat like a cannonball, sinking deep into it.</p><p></p><p>However, the fatty's face still wore a faint smile, not taking Ning Yuhen's attack seriously at all.</p><p></p><p>"Not good!"</p><p></p><p>The thought had just flashed through Ning Yuhen's mind when the fatty's huge fist ruthlessly slammed into his body.</p><p></p><p>Boom! That giant fist, combined with the opponent's powerful cultivation, directly blew Ning Yuhen away in an instant, his waist arching in the air like a giant shrimp.</p><p></p><p>Plop plop...</p><p></p><p>Ning Yuhen was blown away more than fifty meters, rolling on the ground several times before finally coming to a stop.</p><p></p><p>His internal organs were all shattered, his ribs completely broken, and a deep pit had sunken in his chest, looking extremely horrifying.</p><p></p><p>But he still quickly activated his healing art, trying to repair his injuries.</p><p></p><p>Just like a struggling ant in the water, although the hope of survival was slim, he still desperately struggled to stay alive.</p><p></p><p>The muscular man frowned and said coldly:</p><p></p><p>"It seems this brat really wants to defy the Beastly God! In that case, we shall send him on his way according to the righteous laws of the Beastly God Sect!"</p><p></p><p>The fatty smacked his lips.</p><p></p><p>"It's really a pity, he has the bloodline of the Silver Fox Clan, and their healing art is unmatched by anyone. Tsk tsk..."</p><p></p><p>As he spoke, his gaze suddenly turned fierce, and a huge fat frog appeared behind him, faintly illuminating the night sky with a bluish-green glow. That was his spiritual entity.</p><p></p><p>The advantage of the Demihuman over ordinary humans lies in their spiritual entities, which are stronger than those of ordinary people at the same level. Similarly, the enhancement brought by their techniques is also stronger.</p><p></p><p>"Toad Spirit Art - Descent of the Toad God!"</p><p></p><p>With a fierce shout, an invisible spiritual energy gushed out from the toad spiritual entity, like an air cannon, slamming ruthlessly into Ning Yuhen's body.</p><p></p><p>The violent power instantly caused Ning Yuhen's entire skeleton to suffer a huge impact.</p><p></p><p>"Puff!"</p><p></p><p>He violently coughed up a mouthful of fresh blood, and his consciousness was rapidly sinking into unconsciousness.</p><p></p><p>Boom! Accompanied by a violent explosion, the cement road was blasted open into a large hole.</p><p></p><p>The attack ended, and a huge cloud of smoke rose from the ground.</p><p></p><p>"Tsk tsk, it's a pity that we two came all the way to Jianghai City. In the end, we still killed him, what a waste of time."</p><p></p><p>"There's no help for it. He betrayed the Beastly God Sect, and even if he didn't want to go back, we still have to judge him according to the righteous laws of the Beastly God."</p><p></p><p>Here is the full English translation of the excerpt from the Chinese novel:</p><p></p><p>"Him!" </p><p></p><p>As soon as these words were spoken, a cold voice suddenly reached the ears of the two people.</p><p></p><p>"What kind of justice is it to trample on freedom at will?"</p><p></p><p>"Who?" </p><p></p><p>The two of them frowned and looked towards the direction the voice came from. What came into view was a young figure, with a cold expression on his face, one hand in his pocket, and the other holding Ning Yuhen, who was covered in blood and barely alive.</p><p></p><p>Ning Yuhen tried hard to lift his head, but the pain of his injuries made him completely powerless.</p><p></p><p>The next moment, he fell into a coma.</p><p></p><p>The other person glanced at him and said indifferently:</p><p></p><p>"Sleep, sleep for a while, and when you wake up, everything will be fine."</p><p></p><p>The newcomer was Ye Xiao.</p><p></p><p>He had just finished his donkey meat soup and was about to go home, but unexpectedly, he encountered this guy Ning Yuhen in the suburbs.</p><p></p><p>He never thought that Ning Yuhen was being attacked by two of his "own kind".</p><p></p><p>Ye Xiao thought about it for a moment, and he more or less understood.</p><p></p><p>It was said in the books that the aura of the half-beasts is extremely sensitive to their own kind. It should be that the scent he left behind when he treated the little cat at noon had leaked out his own aura.</p><p></p><p>No wonder he sent him a message saying he was going back to his hometown, when in fact he was just trying to escape, this fool.</p><p></p><p>If Ye Xiao hadn't happened to come here, he would have been turned to ashes today.</p><p></p><p>Seeing that Ye Xiao didn't respond, the fat man's face looked a bit ugly.</p><p></p><p>"Hey! You brat, how dare you ignore me? Do you know what you're doing? You fucking..."</p><p></p><p>"Too noisy!"</p><p></p><p>Before he could finish his words, Ye Xiao muttered impatiently, and at the same time, a silver blade beam shot out from his eyes.</p><p></p><p>Boom! The blade beam flashed like a meteor in the night sky, instantly hitting the fat man's body, and in a moment, the fat man exploded into a mist of blood.</p><p></p><p>The muscular man's pupils immediately shrank, and all the hairs on his body stood on end, giving him goosebumps! So strong!</p><p></p><p>Terrifyingly strong!</p><p></p><p>"Gulp!"</p><p></p><p>He swallowed hard, his heart almost jumping out of his throat.</p><p></p><p>From the moment he first saw Ye Xiao, he felt that this guy was no ordinary person.</p><p></p><p>To be able to rescue someone from the powerful attack of his companion, that cultivation was already extremely rare.</p><p></p><p>It's just that he never imagined that the other party would casually unleash a sword intent and mercilessly annihilate his companion, a post-heaven eighth-rank martial artist! And it was an instant kill!</p><p></p><p>This strength, not to mention him, even if a master came, perhaps he couldn't do it so casually, right?</p><p></p><p>He didn't even move a finger!</p><p></p><p>Fear was spreading. Seeing that Ye Xiao had already turned his gaze to him, he trembled in fear and immediately knelt on the ground.</p><p></p><p>"Senior, don't kill me, it's a misunderstanding, I was forced to carry out the order, actually, I have a good relationship with him."</p><p></p><p>Ye Xiao didn't respond to him, but just turned and left, holding Ning Yuhen.</p><p></p><p>The muscular man heaved a sigh of relief, he survived, it's good that he was smart enough to kneel down and beg for mercy, haha haha.</p><p></p><p>Boom! The next moment, he directly exploded into a mist of blood.</p><p></p><p>From the distant darkness, Ye Xiao's voice slowly came.</p><p></p><p>"Anyone who has seen my hand, must die!"</p><p></p><p>It's the third watch, please support me.</p><p></p><p>I saw some negative comments and wanted to fight back, but later I thought, never mind, it makes me look petty.</p><p></p><p>After all, I write to let people read, those who like it read, and those who don't like it can curse a few words, which also gives me traffic.</p><p></p><p>Moreover, my writing level is not that of a great author, it needs to be improved.</p><p></p><p>I just hope for a little recommendation ticket or something free. I don't dare to expect monthly tickets and rewards, is that too much to ask?</p><p></p><p>(This chapter is complete)</p>

        <h1>Chapter 402</h1>
        <div class="content">
            <p>Here is the full English translation of the excerpt from the Chinese novel:</p><p></p><p>"Damn beast! If I find out who did this, I'll kill him for sure!" </p><p></p><p>Cloud Zhenwu couldn't help but speak up:</p><p></p><p>"Elder Cloud, what should we do next? This is ultimately Ning's territory. If we just stay here without any justification, it will surely arouse suspicion. </p><p></p><p>If the Ning family has any objections and reports it to the Xuanyuan Clan, we will inevitably be seen as provocative. Not to mention the Xuanyuan Mountain, even the Cloud Family might not let us off the hook."</p><p></p><p>Cloud Shui clenched his fists. </p><p></p><p>He absolutely could not give up his precious spirit pets! </p><p></p><p>They were all the apples of his eye, and were hard-won battle strengths that he had painstakingly obtained.</p><p></p><p>If he were to abandon them, not only would he be heartbroken, but his overall combat power would also decline significantly. As a beast tamer, he was not particularly adept at martial arts attacks. Without his spirit pets, he would be nothing!</p><p></p><p>"Give me one more day, I will definitely be able to find them within a day."</p><p></p><p>"Elder, what method do you plan to use?"</p><p></p><p>"I have a special technique. By burning the spiritual essence of the Xuanyuan lineage as bait, the soul fragrance produced can drive my spirit pets into a frenzy, exposing their auras. Then I'll be able to find them."</p><p></p><p>Cloud Zhenmu's expression changed.</p><p></p><p>"Elder, you're insane! You want to kill our own Xuanyuan Clan members? This is a serious violation of our clan rules. </p><p></p><p>If discovered, it will be a fate worse than death."</p><p></p><p>Cloud Shui sneered.</p><p></p><p>"Who said I'm going to kill Xuanyuan Clan members? The humans in this world also have divine blood like us. Their souls also possess some Xuanyuan Clan characteristics, and the soul fragrance produced can serve the same purpose."</p><p></p><p>"Even so, isn't this going a bit too far? Those people are still descendants of the Xuanyuan Clan. How is this any different from slaughtering our own offspring?"</p><p></p><p>"Our offspring? Haha, Zhenmu, aren't you being a bit too naive? They are merely the dregs and remnants of the Xuanyuan Clan's bloodline. They are just insects, while we are gods! It would be the greatest honor for them to sacrifice themselves for us."</p><p></p><p>"Forgive me for being blunt, Elder Cloud, but you have already gone mad. I cannot agree to this."</p><p></p><p>With that, Cloud Zhenmu turned to leave. He could not tolerate Elder Cloud's insane idea. </p><p></p><p>Previously, when Elder Cloud wanted to deal with the Immortal Sword Immortal, he had not been able to accept it. He had just thought that Elder Cloud might not be able to find the target, so the matter would be dropped. </p><p></p><p>But now, Elder Cloud was openly planning to use the lives of his own Xuanyuan Clan kin to find his spirit pets. This was truly going to slaughter his own clan, which he could not accept.</p><p></p><p>In the world of cultivators, it was indeed a survival of the fittest, and extremely cruel. Killings did occur from time to time.</p><p></p><p>But not touching one's own clan was a bottom line that had to be upheld across the entire starry sky. </p><p></p><p>Unless one's own clan members had committed extremely heinous acts that violated clan rules, they could not be slaughtered. At other times, they absolutely could not be harmed.</p><p></p><p>Otherwise, a clan could easily collapse from within. </p><p></p><p>In the perilous starry sky where countless races existed, this was the greatest taboo for every divine clan!</p><p></p><p>However, just as he was about to turn around, a sharp pain suddenly pierced his chest.</p><p></p><p>Pu ci--! He widened his eyes and slowly lowered his head, looking at his chest.</p><p></p><p>He could not believe that Elder Cloud, whom he had always been loyal to and done so much for, would actually attack him.</p><p></p><p>"Elder Cloud, you... you..."</p><p></p><p>Elder Cloud sneered coldly.</p><p></p><p>"Although I'm just a beast tamer and my combat strength is not strong, I may not necessarily be able to handle a peak Shattering God Realm expert. But am I really incapable of dealing with a mere Godly Realm Fifth Stage brat like you? Dare to defy me, and this is your consequence."</p><p></p><p>"You beast!"</p><p></p><p>Cloud Zhenmu uttered his last words, and Elder Cloud directly shattered his vital organs, while also extracting his divine soul and beginning to incinerate it.</p><p></p><p>"Ah, Cloud Shui, may you never find peace!"</p><p></p><p>Cloud Zhenmu's soul form let out a roar and dissipated into the air as smoke.</p><p></p><p>This aura quickly diffused into the surrounding air.</p><p></p><p>On Leaf Xiao's side, after returning home, he suddenly sensed some commotion in his underground cellar.</p><p></p><p>He swept his divine sense over it and was somewhat surprised.</p><p></p><p>The spirit beasts in there had actually started to become violent.</p><p></p><p>Their eyes had turned a vivid red, their auras were uncontrollably fluctuating, and even their fur was standing on end.</p><p></p><p>"What is this...?"</p><p></p><p>Leaf Xiao was curious. He then slapped the ground, reinforcing the formation that separated the cellar from the real world, further thickening the barrier.</p><p></p><p>The next moment, the spirit beasts that had been wanting to act up calmed down again.</p><p></p><p>Leaf Xiao shook his head and stepped into the courtyard.</p><p></p><p>Meanwhile, on the Cloud Family's spiritual energy ship, Cloud Shui suddenly opened his eyes.</p><p></p><p>Here is my translation of the Chinese excerpt:</p><p></p><p>"How strange, I clearly just felt some movement, but in the blink of an eye it disappeared again. Could it be that Cloud Zhenwu's spiritual body is not strong enough?"</p><p></p><p>He glanced outside, and the other Cloud family warriors were all out there. If he brought in more Cloud family disciples, he would inevitably expose himself. </p><p></p><p>The Xuanyuan Clan would not sit idly by about this matter. It seems he couldn't just rely on Cloud family disciples, he should also go look for people with Xuanyuan Clan bloodlines in the Jianghai City.</p><p></p><p>In the short span of one night, Ye Xiao's underground cellar had experienced countless disturbances, but each time Ye Xiao had managed to suppress them.</p><p></p><p>It wasn't until the next morning that things finally calmed down a bit.</p><p></p><p>Today was Saturday, and Ye Xiao didn't have to go to work, he just went out for a morning stroll.</p><p></p><p>However, he clearly noticed that there were more members of the defense squad on the streets.</p><p></p><p>There were even some Ning family warriors among them.</p><p></p><p>At an intersection, Ye Xiao encountered Gu Hai, who was on patrol duty.</p><p></p><p>"Fatty, what's going on today? Why are there so many more defense squad members on the main streets?"</p><p></p><p>Gu Hai looked back at him and said:</p><p></p><p>"Don't even mention it. I don't know why, but several people went missing last night. The Ning family suspects there may be people from the Hundred Clan Alliance infiltrating, so they have us conducting inspections."</p><p></p><p>Hearing this, Ye Xiao couldn't help but furrow his brow.</p><p></p><p>Wasn't there also a lot of strange activity in his own underground cellar last night? He had asked those spirit beasts, but they didn't know what was going on either, only that they felt an inexplicable restlessness in their bodies and their blood started flowing faster uncontrollably.</p><p></p><p>Could these two incidents be related?</p><p></p><p>If that's the case, it should have something to do with the Cloud family.</p><p></p><p>Because those spirit pets were sent out by the Cloud family and captured by himself.</p><p></p><p>If that's truly the case, then he'll have to try something tonight.</p><p></p><p>After all, Jianghai City is where he lives, he can't let the Cloud family run amok right under his nose.</p><p></p><p>Time passed quickly, and before he knew it, it was already night.</p><p></p><p>Ye Xiao took out a Sovereign Beast - the Dragon Blood Tiger - from below, intending to use it as bait to try and locate the other party.</p><p></p><p>When the Dragon Blood Tiger was released, Ye Xiao deliberately concealed its aura, so as to avoid alerting the other side. </p><p></p><p>It's better to let the other party come find him, rather than him going to find them - that way he can catch them off guard!</p><p></p><p>Sure enough, as soon as the moon rose, the Dragon Blood Tiger's eyes turned blood-red, its fur standing on end. The other spirit beasts below were the same, but they were isolated by the formation, so they weren't as intense as the Dragon Blood Tiger.</p><p></p><p>The enraged Dragon Blood Tiger immediately ran off in a certain direction.</p><p></p><p>Ye Xiao put on his cloak, hat, and mask, and followed closely behind.</p><p></p><p>One tiger and one person quickly arrived at a small alley.</p><p></p><p>At this time, the clouds had drifted away from the moon, and the pure white moonlight poured into the small alley.</p><p></p><p>Ye Xiao's eyes spotted a figure he had recognized long ago - Cloud Shui!</p><p></p><p>"So it was you!"</p><p></p><p>Next to Cloud Shui lay a young woman, covered in blood and completely motionless, obviously already dead.</p><p></p><p>Ye Xiao's spiritual eyes could clearly see a soul flame on Cloud Shui's hand, just extinguished.</p><p></p><p>In that instant, a chilling aura emanated from Ye Xiao's eyes.</p><p></p><p>Cloud Shui, seeing the Dragon Blood Tiger, couldn't help but curl his lips into a smug smile.</p><p></p><p>He took out a tissue and elegantly wiped the blood off his hands.</p><p></p><p>"I finally found you! I thought you would be able to hold out longer. To be able to subdue so many of my spirit beasts, I thought you must be quite powerful. But looking at your aura, you're only at Deicide Realm Second Stage!"</p><p></p><p>As soon as he finished speaking, Ye Xiao single-handedly tossed the Dragon Blood Tiger into his spatial storage ring, his icy gaze fixed on Cloud Shui.</p><p></p><p>"Beating you will be enough!"</p><p></p><p>Cloud Shui sneered coldly.</p><p></p><p>"At just Deicide Realm Second Stage, you're not even worthy of being my shoe-shiner, you..."</p><p></p><p>This time, Ye Xiao didn't let him finish, the Rift Star Fist already striking out.</p><p></p><p>The earth-shattering fist force ruthlessly slammed into Cloud Shui's abdomen.</p><p></p><p>Boom! Accompanied by a thunderous roar, Cloud Shui was blasted away like a cannonball, shattering countless walls and being knocked out of Jianghai City.</p><p></p><p>This punch was so powerful and fast that Cloud Shui didn't even have time to react. Although he was at Deicide Realm Fifth Stage, he felt as if all his internal organs had been shattered by that strike.</p><p></p><p>If it wasn't for the fact that his cultivation was higher than the opponent, this punch might have taken his life!</p><p></p><p>But he didn't have time to ponder further, because Ye Xiao was already approaching him again.</p><p></p><p>"So fast!"</p>

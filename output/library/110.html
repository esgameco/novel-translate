        <h1>Chapter 110</h1>
        <div class="content">
            <p>Here is the full English translation of the excerpt from the Chinese novel:</p><p></p><p>The sales manager smiled and said:</p><p></p><p>"Sir, you have a good niece. In fact, if you really want to bribe me, this is a serious crime. I won't tell you the identity of the forgemaster, nor will I tell you where we procured these throwing knives.</p><p></p><p>But what I can tell you is that in the Nine Provinces, there is a regulation that if you report the illegal acquisition of information about a forgemaster, you will receive double the bribery amount.</p><p></p><p>So I will definitely report you.</p><p></p><p>And you, on suspicion of endangering someone's life, will be invited by the garrison troops to "have tea."</p><p></p><p>Qin Mingfeng smiled awkwardly, feeling a bit embarrassed.</p><p></p><p>In fact, he knew this, it's just that he had never before wanted to find a forgemaster just because he saw a certain weapon.</p><p></p><p>This time, it was purely because he wanted to find that swordsman, and he got a bit obsessed for a moment.</p><p></p><p>"Be more careful next time. Can you help me wrap up these throwing knives first? Also, if you have this kind of throwing knife again in the future, can you contact me first? I'll buy them all, that's not illegal, right?"</p><p></p><p>"This request is acceptable, I'll add you a contact method later."</p><p></p><p>Qin Mingfeng bought all the throwing knives, at an average price of 200,000 per piece.</p><p></p><p>Normally, ordinary people wouldn't buy such small throwing knives, after all, money doesn't grow on trees.</p><p></p><p>With a few times more money, one could directly buy a mid-sized weapon like a master-level steel sword.</p><p></p><p>Master-level weapons, including those below master-level, have the concept that the power of larger weapons exceeds that of smaller ones.</p><p></p><p>But only Qin Mingfeng knew that although this throwing knife is small, its power is not inferior to those ordinary mid-sized master-level weapons.</p><p></p><p>This price is not a loss for Ye Xiao.</p><p></p><p>Boss Xu has to pay taxes when selling weapons, the weapon store also has to pay taxes when selling weapons, and Boss Xu and the weapon store, as intermediaries, also need to make a profit.</p><p></p><p>And by selling it through Boss Xu, it avoids Ye Xiao directly trading with the weapon store and having his identity information recorded.</p><p></p><p>Of course, he could also sell it on the black market, without paying taxes and without having his information recorded. </p><p></p><p>But the black market, without the guarantee of a formal company, the price would be very cheap, and it's inevitable that it would attract a lot of envy.</p><p></p><p>It's better to cooperate with Boss Xu, it's simpler.</p><p></p><p>After buying the throwing knives, Qin Mingfeng took out one and gave it to Qin Yuyan.</p><p></p><p>Although Jianghai City is relatively peaceful, you never know when a star beast might suddenly invade. Having an extra life-saving treasure is a good thing.</p><p></p><p>Ye Xiao didn't know about this yet, still going to work and reading books every day.</p><p></p><p>He had already learned seven of the foundational techniques of alchemy, but the golden book still had no reaction, only the Chenxing Incantation and the Supplementary Heaven Technique had faintly glowing golden light.</p><p></p><p>This means the foundation of alchemy has not been accumulated enough yet.</p><p></p><p>He still needs to keep working hard.</p><p></p><p>The fourth floor and above are currently being reorganized, so he can't go up there for now, he can only wait until the preparations are complete, then go ask the curator for a pass.</p><p></p><p>That day, Ye Xiao was reading a book when the fragrance of gardenia flowers wafted over, and Qin Yuyan's figure appeared before him.</p><p></p><p>"It's been a few days, you're still so diligent, you scholar."</p><p></p><p>Ye Xiao put down the book.</p><p></p><p>"Why do you have time to come today? Shouldn't you be participating in the teacher assessment recently?"</p><p></p><p>"The assessment will be over by the end of August, and classes start on September 1st, I've already been teaching for many days."</p><p></p><p>"Congratulations."</p><p></p><p>"Thank you."</p><p></p><p>In the distance, a few librarians would occasionally glance over here, chatting and laughing.</p><p></p><p>Ye Xiao and Qin Yuyan both knew the content of their conversation.</p><p></p><p>Basically, it was all gossip about what kind of intimacy there was between the two of them.</p><p></p><p>At first, Qin Yuyan would still feel a little...</p><p></p><p>Here is the full English translation of the Chinese excerpt:</p><p></p><p>There was some blushing, and after a while, the two seemed to have gotten used to it.</p><p></p><p>"Today I want to find some books related to the cultivation of multiple martial arts. Can you help me with that?"</p><p></p><p>Ye Xiao pondered for a moment and then said:</p><p></p><p>"On the fifth shelf of the second bookshelf in Area D, there are two books - 'Mutual Martial Arts' and 'Day and Night Transformation Technique'. On the bottom shelf of the seventh bookshelf in Area F, in the corner, there is a book called 'Theory of Using One Mind for Multiple Purposes'.</p><p></p><p>They are all books related to the cultivation of multiple martial arts.</p><p></p><p>As for cultivation techniques, you'll probably need to apply to go to the fourth floor or above, as those are more obscure. But the fourth floor is currently under renovation, so you can't go up there for now."</p><p></p><p>"Then I'll take a look at these three books first."</p><p></p><p>Qin Yuyan took the three books and sat down across from Ye Xiao to read them, while Ye Xiao also resumed reading his own book. The two sat in silence, neither saying a word.</p><p></p><p>Qin Yuyan finished the three books quite quickly. </p><p></p><p>When she closed the books, Ye Xiao had just finished reading the last one as well.</p><p></p><p>Qin Yuyan's brow was furrowed, indicating that she hadn't fully understood the content.</p><p></p><p>"Ye Xiao, can a person really cultivate several martial arts simultaneously and reach the pinnacle of each one?"</p><p></p><p>"I'm not sure, but theoretically it's impossible. A person's talent and time are limited. If you cultivate multiple martial arts at the same time, your achievements in each one will inevitably be mediocre, and it will be difficult to reach the pinnacle."</p><p></p><p>Qin Yuyan nodded.</p><p></p><p>"Yes, cultivating multiple martial arts at the same time is too difficult. If there was someone who could cultivate several martial arts simultaneously and reach the pinnacle of each one, he would probably no longer be human."</p><p></p><p>Ye Xiao was taken aback. "(_..)!"</p><p></p><p>This was not the first time he had heard such words, and it made him feel quite helpless.</p><p></p><p>In fact, he was even starting to doubt himself. Was he really not human?</p><p></p><p>Thinking about it carefully, the humans in this world indeed did not have the kind of extraordinary cultivation abilities that he possessed.</p><p></p><p>And he was also a transmigrator, so who knows what he really is now, even though he can still breathe and cultivate like a human.</p><p></p><p>Perhaps, he might not be human after all.</p><p></p><p>"Are you still single? Haven't you found a partner yet?"</p><p></p><p>Ye Xiao shook his head.</p><p></p><p>"Not interested, dating is too tiring. It's better to be alone."</p><p></p><p>"I feel the same way. Being alone is so much better. Only fools would date."</p><p></p><p>Qin Yuyan seemed to have found a kindred spirit.</p><p></p><p>"I've never dated anyone my whole life, and my friends always tease me about it. People should focus on cultivating martial arts while they're young."</p><p></p><p>Ye Xiao nodded, acknowledging her words.</p><p></p><p>"Duang~!"</p><p></p><p>At this moment, the sound of the work bell rang. Ye Xiao closed his book and put it back on the shelf.</p><p></p><p>"It's time to leave. If there's nothing else, I'm going to have dinner. Goodbye."</p><p></p><p>Qin Yuyan nodded, also picking up the books and putting them back in their original places.</p><p></p><p>"I should go too, I still have a class this afternoon."</p><p></p><p>However, just as she stood up, a black throwing knife slipped out of her pocket.</p><p></p><p>The moment Ye Xiao saw the throwing knife, his eyes suddenly flickered.</p><p></p><p>Wasn't that the one he had just sold a couple of days ago? When did Qin Yuyan get it?</p><p></p><p>[This is the end of the first update. Please leave a vote.]</p><p></p><p>Thank you, book friend Moon433, for the reward. I'm deeply grateful.</p><p></p><p>[This is the end of the chapter.]</p>

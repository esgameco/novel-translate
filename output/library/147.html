        <div class="content">
            <p>Here is the full English translation of the Chinese excerpt:</p><p></p><p>Reading books, reading books, reading books with all one's might.</p><p></p><p>After getting up, Ye Xiao bought a multigrain pancake, paired with a sour yogurt drink, and drank it while rushing towards the library.</p><p></p><p>When passing through the traffic light intersection, he ran into Gu Hai on duty.</p><p></p><p>Ye Xiao felt that Gu Hai's righteousness was becoming more and more upright!</p><p></p><p>It might be that protecting the people has gradually formed a kind of towering righteousness.</p><p></p><p>In the past, didn't people always say that Uncle Policeman had a towering righteousness that could dispel disasters and avoid calamities?</p><p></p><p>Now Gu Hai also has it, which made Ye Xiao very gratified.</p><p></p><p>After all, a year ago, Gu Hai was still a rascal, always running to the red-light district wherever it was.</p><p></p><p>But now, he is protecting the safety of the people.</p><p></p><p>The most gratifying thing about a person is when they shape up, and it's not in vain that Ye Xiao went to find Old Lu to bail him out back then.</p><p></p><p>Moreover, his cultivation has also broken through to the post-Heavenly Fifth Rank, it seems that after joining the special training camp, his strength has made great progress and improvement.</p><p></p><p>"Ah! Old Ye, going to work?"</p><p></p><p>Gu Hai greeted first.</p><p></p><p>Ye Xiao nodded in response.</p><p></p><p>"Do you want to have some breakfast?"</p><p></p><p>"No, I don't have an appetite."</p><p></p><p>"Okay then, but why are you on duty here today?"</p><p></p><p>"Don't mention it, Jianghai City has been one trouble after another recently.</p><p></p><p>Just last night, another incident occurred.</p><p></p><p>A total of six men were affected, and the preliminary judgment is that it was the work of a Star Beast. But we don't have a single clue."</p><p></p><p>"It's unavoidable to have some escapees after the Seven Stars Convergence. I'm going to work first, you stay busy."</p><p></p><p>"Wait, Old Ye."</p><p></p><p>"What is it?"</p><p></p><p>"These past few days, you'd better pay attention to your safety. That Star Beast may very well target you next."</p><p></p><p>Ye Xiao revealed a puzzled expression.</p><p></p><p>"What makes you say that?"</p><p></p><p>Gu Hai's face turned solemn as he took a deep breath.</p><p></p><p>"The six who died were all handsome men!"</p><p></p><p>Ye Xiao paused for a moment, then nodded and continued on his way to the library.</p><p></p><p>The dead were all handsome men?</p><p></p><p>Could it be that the Star Beast has some unspeakable perversion?</p><p></p><p>This is not an exaggeration.</p><p></p><p>Because Star Beasts are of all kinds and types, there are even some that fall in love with humans and give birth to offspring, so this kind of thing is not surprising.</p><p></p><p>Ye Xiao used the Taixuan Tiangong technique to scan the entire Jianghai City, but did not find any Star Beasts.</p><p></p><p>"Could it be that the other party is hiding?" </p><p></p><p>Never mind, it's not certain whether the other party is in this city or not, Ye Xiao shook his head and didn't think about it anymore.</p><p></p><p>First go to work, maybe the other party has already left? Arriving at the library, Yang Qian had already arrived earlier than him, and the entire area had been cleaned up thoroughly the night before, which made Ye Xiao quite satisfied, it seems that Yang Qian is still a pretty good subordinate.</p><p></p><p>At this time, she was practicing punches at the window.</p><p></p><p>Seeing Ye Xiao arrive, she immediately stopped her movements and greeted him.</p><p></p><p>"Manager, hello."</p><p></p><p>Ye Xiao nodded, his gaze sweeping over the hilltop.</p><p></p><p>It seems that Yang Qian came very early and had been punching for a while, the hilltop was slightly drizzling and had already been soaked.</p><p></p><p>"The library is not a boxing ring, you still need to pay attention to your appearance and attire. You can practice boxing, but don't get all sweaty and wet your clothes."</p><p></p><p>Yang Qian's face turned serious: "Sweating is the glory of a warrior, if you don't sweat during training, you'll have to bleed during battle."</p><p></p><p>"But you're not a warrior now, you're just a librarian."</p><p></p><p>Ye Xiao's words made Yang Qian lower her head without a word, clenching her fists tightly, her nails digging deep into the flesh of her palms.</p><p></p><p>Ye Xiao didn't say anything more, everyone has their own story, and he didn't feel like asking more.</p><p></p><p>Reading books, reading books, improving cultivation is the priority.</p><p></p><p>In the blink of an eye, another day had quietly passed, and Ye Xiao found another basic fist technique from the techniques sent by Shaolin.</p><p></p><p>However, Ye Xiao's current reading is not like before, where he would focus on studying a particular technique.</p><p></p><p>Now he reads books more diversely.</p><p></p><p>In the early stage when he was collecting techniques, Ye Xiao's thinking was simple, he just wanted to first synthesize a few Emperor Techniques so that he would have sufficiently powerful techniques to use.</p><p></p><p>But now, whether it's attack methods, endurance methods, or life-saving methods, he has already acquired techniques, so the remaining ones are naturally not as urgent.</p><p></p><p>There is another very important reason, and that is that Ye Xiao previously fell into a misconception.</p><p></p><p>He simply cultivated the techniques he wanted.</p><p></p><p>But in fact, many techniques are not as bad as he thought.</p><p></p><p>Take the palm technique he just synthesized, the Tathagata Divine Palm, for example.</p><p></p><p>Ye Xiao originally thought that palm techniques would definitely be weaker than sword techniques and knife techniques.</p><p></p><p>Because knife techniques and sword techniques are mainly weapon-based, while palm techniques are based on bare-handed attacks.</p><p></p><p>How could flesh and blood possibly be stronger than weapons?</p><p></p><p>But after learning, Ye Xiao found that the power of the Tathagata Divine Palm is not weaker than the Tyrant Blade and the Heavenly Slash.</p><p></p><p>This is just a palm technique, what about fist techniques? Claw techniques? Leg techniques?</p><p></p><p>Hearing that Shaolin...</p><p></p><p>Here is the full English translation of the Chinese excerpt:</p><p></p><p>There was a grandmaster-level martial art technique - the Dragon Claw Hand. It was extremely firm and yang-dominant, able to shatter iron and split steel, as simple as reaching into a bag and taking something out.</p><p></p><p>If this were to be combined with other claw techniques to form an imperial art, how powerful would it be?</p><p></p><p>And those finger techniques - a single finger could sever the heavens and earth, who could block it? In the martial arts path, the levels are generally not too distinct, but there are inevitably ways to counter each other.</p><p></p><p>Even if one's own cultivation was very strong, if they encountered a countering technique, they would still have difficulty unleashing their full power.</p><p></p><p>Therefore, one must learn and practice more. </p><p></p><p>It would be best to learn all the martial arts techniques in the world. Then, who knows how terrifying the power of the Golden Book would become? Would it reach the point where a single thought could command life and death, a single word could distort space and time?</p><p></p><p>Soon, it was evening. After dinner at the cafeteria, Ye Xiao set off to return home.</p><p></p><p>At this time, on the desolate ancient road of Qinzhou, a figure quietly passed by, cupping his hands in a salute towards the rugged and treacherous mountain path.</p><p></p><p>"On the day of the Seven Stars Linked, the Nine州Sovereign Star Beasts have escaped. The Nine州Alliance has come to request the Sword Saint to emerge from seclusion and capture the Star Beasts."</p><p></p><p>The voice echoed through the vast ancient road, the mountain wind howling, the mountain path like a long and steep antenna, it was unclear if the person on the mountain could hear it.</p><p></p><p>Seeing no response from the mountain, the figure took a half-step forward.</p><p></p><p>But before his foot touched the ground, a silver gleam suddenly descended from the nine heavens.</p><p></p><p>Boom! The sword beam stabbed fiercely in front of him, the shockwave not too strong, but it still directly sent the Transcendent Realm Second Rank Patriarch flying, tumbling dozens of times on the ground before stopping hundreds of meters away.</p><p></p><p>"On the Dao of the Sword, outsiders shall not trespass. The Nine州Alliance sent you, but do you not even know this basic principle?"</p><p></p><p>The envoy got up from the ground, looking up to see a young woman in a white dress, hands clasped behind her back, slowly stepping down. He couldn't help but be startled.</p><p></p><p>It was not just because of her breathtaking beauty, but more importantly, because of her cultivation.</p><p></p><p>For cultivators, they could generally tell one's bone age from their appearance.</p><p></p><p>It was like ordinary people who couldn't see the true face of a heavily made-up woman. But for cultivators, they could see through all of that at a glance.</p><p></p><p>This woman's cultivation was actually only in her mid-twenties, yet she had already reached the Transcendent Realm Third Rank, surpassing him by an entire rank. Truly terrifying!</p><p></p><p>"Miss, please forgive me, I was hasty in my actions, just trying to complete the task assigned by the Alliance."</p><p></p><p>"Since it's your first offense, I'll spare your life. Now scram."</p><p></p><p>"But Miss, the Alliance's task..."</p><p></p><p>Before he could finish, the woman directly retorted:</p><p></p><p>"A few Sovereign Star Beasts are worthy of my Master coming out of seclusion? How utterly ridiculous. My Master is in closed-door cultivation, he won't come out. Now scram."</p><p></p><p>As soon as her words fell, a deep voice descended from the mountaintop.</p><p></p><p>"Xian'er, do not be rude."</p><p></p><p>With this one sentence, it seemed to carry an unparalleled sword intent. The clouds in the sky parted, revealing the clear night sky, stunningly beautiful.</p><p></p><p>The next moment, a gentle breeze blew, and a figure silently appeared before the two.</p><p></p><p>His appearance was so abrupt, yet so natural, as if he had been standing there all along.</p><p></p><p>The envoy glanced at him - white-haired but with bright eyes and a ruddy complexion. Wearing a plain long robe, swaying with the wind, exuding an immortal aura.</p><p></p><p>The envoy couldn't help but reveal an expression of utmost reverence on his face! The Sword Saint of the Nine州- Lu Qingshan!</p><p></p><p>A terrifyingly powerful existence.</p><p></p><p>Ranked 10th in the World Dragon Ranking, and known as the Sword and Knife Guardians of the Nine州 along with the 9th ranked Knife Deity Li Liushui. This was a true high-level expert!</p><p></p><p>His cultivation, surpassing hundreds of billions of people in the world. </p><p></p><p>As for his sword dao, apart from the Number One of the Nine州, the Sword Emperor Azure Dragon who topped the World Dragon Ranking, no one else could withstand him.</p><p></p><p>The Sword Kings of the other州, like Atlantis and Liu Chengxun, had all been defeated by him.</p><p></p><p>It could be said that in the realm of the sword dao, without the Sword Emperor, who else could rival him?</p><p></p><p>"Master, these few Sovereign Star Beasts are not worthy of your personal attention."</p><p></p><p>"Xian'er, do not be reckless. The Sovereign Star Beasts are by no means trivial. In the next four years, the Beast Calamity will begin, and during this period, the Nine州must avoid upheaval."</p><p></p><p>"But Master, you are currently in closed-door cultivation, coming out now would it not delay the great matter?"</p><p></p><p>"No matter, I have forged my body with sword intent, it will not hinder my cultivation."</p><p></p><p>As he spoke, a duplicate of himself suddenly formed beside him.</p><p></p><p>But compared to the original, it lacked some of the divine aura, far weaker than the true master.</p><p></p><p>"This sword intent clone of mine, while only at the Transcendent Realm Seventh Rank, has condensed my sword intent, and within the same realm, it can be considered undefeatable. It should be able to easily slay a few Transcendent Realm Seventh Rank Star Beasts. Let it go with you."</p><p></p><p>The envoy's heart was surging with violent waves of shock! A sword intent could condense a Transcendent Realm Seventh Rank clone! This was the true foundation of the Nine州's strongest experts?</p><p></p><p>One more update, three thousand words.</p><p></p><p>Thank you to readers Dennis, new patron, and little ball for the donations, greatly appreciated.</p><p></p><p>Please support me, subscribe, vote, and comment. </p><p></p><p>I hope everyone doesn't "养书" (stop reading), I work hard to update over 20,000 words every day, which is equivalent to over 10 chapters for others. If readers stop reading, the author may die.</p><p></p><p>(Chapter end)</p>

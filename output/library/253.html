        <h1>Chapter 253</h1>
        <div class="content">
            <p>Here is the full English translation of the Chinese excerpt:</p><p></p><p>"Wait a moment, I feel like this seems to be the kind of celestial phenomenon that would be triggered when the Imperial Formation appears?"</p><p></p><p>As soon as these words were spoken, everyone was shocked.</p><p></p><p>"Whew~ Old Chen, have you become this powerful now? The formation you set up can actually trigger a celestial phenomenon on this scale?"</p><p></p><p>The corners of Chen Qingxuan's mouth couldn't help but twitch.</p><p></p><p>In fact, he had noticed earlier than his students that this was a celestial phenomenon triggered by a formation. He was also shocked as to why this was happening. But one thing was clear to him.</p><p></p><p>That is, this celestial phenomenon was absolutely not triggered by his own formation.</p><p></p><p>He understood the level of his own formation skills.</p><p></p><p>He alone could never reach this level. Only when he collaborated with a few other top professors in the country could they achieve something like this.</p><p></p><p>"Old Du, by saying that, you're basically slapping my face.</p><p></p><p>I did establish such an Imperial Formation, but that was something I built together with other top formation masters in the country.</p><p></p><p>On my own, I definitely could not have reached this level."</p><p></p><p>Du Changfeng was slightly startled.</p><p></p><p>"You are already considered one of the peak formation masters in the entire Nine Provinces, yet you still cannot create a formation that can trigger a celestial phenomenon of this scale?"</p><p></p><p>Although Du Changfeng was previously a professor at the Jingzhou Martial Arts University, he actually didn't understand much about formations.</p><p></p><p>As the saying goes, "Separated by a profession is like separated by a mountain." Since he didn't understand formations, he naturally didn't know how high the level of formation skills was.</p><p></p><p>In the next moment, the speed at which Jianghai City was absorbing spiritual energy suddenly went berserk.</p><p></p><p>It was as if a huge whirlpool had formed in the vast sea, swallowing the surrounding seawater.</p><p></p><p>"My goodness!"</p><p></p><p>The crowd couldn't help but exclaim in shock, all of them dumbfounded.</p><p></p><p>This speed of spiritual energy absorption was far, far beyond the formation that Chen Qingxuan had just set up.</p><p></p><p>The spiritual gathering formation set up by Chen Qingxuan was already several times stronger than the previous formation set up by Guangliang.</p><p></p><p>But now, this new unknown spiritual gathering formation directly annihilated Chen Qingxuan's formation!</p><p></p><p>This was too powerful.</p><p></p><p>Seeing this scene, Chen Qingxuan sighed softly.</p><p></p><p>"There are people beyond people, and heavens beyond heavens. This is truly a supreme expert!</p><p></p><p>Compared to him, I, the so-called top professor in the country, feel like a little child. Completely insignificant.</p><p></p><p>Old Du, he is from your Jianghai City. Do you know who he is?"</p><p></p><p>Du Changfeng also let out a heavy sigh, his expression grave. "If I'm not mistaken, it should be him.</p><p></p><p>Have you heard of the supreme expert in Jianghai City?"</p><p></p><p>"The supreme expert in Jianghai City?"</p><p></p><p>"Yes, the one who's been very famous online recently."</p><p></p><p>"You must be talking about the Sword Immortal, right? But that can't be right! Isn't he a cultivator of the martial dao?"</p><p></p><p>Chen Qingxuan looked puzzled as he stared at Du Changfeng.</p><p></p><p>Du Changfeng smiled wryly.</p><p></p><p>"He is indeed a cultivator of the martial dao. But in fact, his attainments in the path of formations are also far beyond the reach of ordinary people. There is even an Imperial Formation set up by him in Jianghai City now."</p><p></p><p>Chen Qingxuan was dumbfounded. After a few seconds of stunned silence, he looked at the endless spiritual energy pouring into Jianghai City and sighed, "Incredible! There is actually such a supreme expert in this world. I'm truly in awe."</p><p></p><p>Several powerful experts in Jianghai City, sensing the sudden increase in the speed of spiritual energy absorption, also couldn't help but be taken aback.</p><p></p><p>"What's going on? Why has the spiritual energy absorption in the city suddenly increased so much?"</p><p></p><p>"The speed is a bit too fast, isn't it?"</p><p></p><p>"I heard that the top-tier formation masters sent by the Nine Provinces Alliance from the capital are building a formation here. Could this formation be the one they built?"</p><p></p><p>"Impossible, right? This formation... I feel like it's even more powerful than the spiritual gathering formation in Jingzhou."</p><p></p><p>In the library, the newly appointed librarian, Jiang Chen, narrowed his eyes.</p><p></p><p>"This formation is so powerful! The Alliance sent Chen Qingxuan to build a formation, could it be them? No, it's not him!</p><p></p><p>That kid's level is something I've seen, and he's still far from reaching this kind of level."</p><p></p><p>Thinking about this, he walked out of the library and carefully sensed the situation, only to discover that the center of the formation was actually under the feet of the Sword Immortal statue in front of him.</p><p></p><p>"This is... the Sword Immortal of Jianghai City? Has his attainments in formations reached such an astonishing level?</p><p></p><p>In the entire Nine Provinces, I've never seen a formation master stronger than him! Sword Immortal, who are you exactly?"</p><p></p><p>Liuxing Xun naturally also sensed this change.</p><p></p><p>He came to the window and stared at the Sword Immortal statue for a moment.</p><p></p><p>"Senior, could it be that this time, you have intervened in secret again? No wonder you are truly worthy of being called the supreme expert in this world, capable of shaking heaven and earth to this extent!"</p><p></p><p>As he said this, his gaze inadvertently glanced at the librarian at the door.</p><p></p><p>"That guy, isn't he the newly appointed librarian? Judging from his expression, could he have also guessed that this is the work of the Sword Immortal? He seems to have some abilities."</p><p></p><p>Here is my translation of the Chinese excerpt you provided:</p><p></p><p>The little sixth-rank Grandmaster was actually able to see through this, not bad at all.</p><p></p><p>But the most frenzied ones were the "domestic fowl" within the formation!</p><p></p><p>Although Ye Xiao had told them earlier that he would cultivate them, when it actually came to doing it, it would likely take a very long time. </p><p></p><p>After all, to make so many Saint Realm experts improve their cultivation, just the preparation time alone would not be short. </p><p></p><p>In their hearts, it would take at least a month or even more.</p><p></p><p>But unexpectedly, Ye Xiao said it in the morning and they started in the evening. </p><p></p><p>This speed was a bit too fast, wasn't it? What surprised them even more was the speed of absorbing spiritual energy in this formation - it was over 20 times stronger than before! Incredible!</p><p></p><p>With this spiritual gathering formation, and being at the center of the formation, one could imagine how rich and powerful the spiritual energy supply in their environment would be. </p><p></p><p>This would directly increase their cultivation speed by over 20 times compared to before!</p><p></p><p>"Damn, Ye Xiao really is amazing, so overpowered."</p><p></p><p>"The domestic fowls' days are looking up now! If he had brought out this technique earlier, I wouldn't have argued with him for so long. I would have just become a domestic fowl directly."</p><p></p><p>"This is truly a heavenly paradise, being a domestic fowl is getting more and more addictive. Awesome!"</p><p></p><p>Among the star beasts, the most excited one was Saimuel.</p><p></p><p>For all these years, he had been ranked as one of the three great generals under the Tiger God, together with Strength God Blue Ox and War God Sealed Dragon.</p><p></p><p>But what others didn't know was that in reality, Strength God Blue Ox and War God Sealed Dragon actually looked down on him.</p><p></p><p>The reason was simply that his strength was not enough. </p><p></p><p>Strength God Blue Ox and War God Sealed Dragon had already reached the Demigod Beast realm, while he was only at the peak of the Ninth-Rank Saint Realm, still far from the Demigod Beast realm.</p><p></p><p>So he had always been very troubled, troubled by his insufficient cultivation, and even in his own heart, he felt like he was just a filler.</p><p></p><p>But now it was different.</p><p></p><p>With this spiritual gathering formation, from today onwards, he would cultivate at the fastest speed. </p><p></p><p>This speed would be even faster than cultivating by the Tiger God's side! He must be able to reach the Demigod Beast realm in the shortest time possible.</p><p></p><p>No, if he remembered correctly, Ye Xiao had previously said that he would go all out to help them improve their cultivation.</p><p></p><p>So there might be other methods to accelerate his cultivation improvement as well.</p><p></p><p>In that case, he might even have the chance to surpass Blue Ox and Sealed Dragon! Saimuel became more and more excited, his body even starting to tremble.</p><p></p><p>Over a thousand years!</p><p></p><p>It had been over a thousand years!</p><p></p><p>He had finally waited for his time to turn the tables.</p><p></p><p>When he got out of this seal, whether it was Strength God Blue Ox or War God Sealed Dragon, they might have already turned to dust. But even if they didn't turn to dust, it didn't matter.</p><p></p><p>Because he would become a true star beast that completely surpassed them!</p><p></p><p>He might even become a true Godly Beast!</p><p></p><p>To accelerate the progress, should he consider giving Ye Xiao more flesh and blood? Instead of just cutting off one wing and one leg per day, he could cut off two wings and two legs per day.</p><p></p><p>After all, Ye Xiao had healing arts, and he couldn't die in here, and the injuries would heal quickly.</p><p></p><p>Maybe Ye Xiao would even give him something better to help him improve his cultivation faster.</p><p></p><p>Just thinking about it made him feel overjoyed.</p><p></p><p>Ye Xiao had already anticipated this situation, so he wasn't overly excited.</p><p></p><p>And his goal was much greater than these domestic fowls.</p><p></p><p>He wanted to cultivate these domestic fowls to the Demigod Beast and Godly Beast realms in a short time, and then provide even stronger flesh and blood to assist his own cultivation.</p><p></p><p>After completing this task, he would directly return to his own home to plan the next step.</p><p></p><p>Meanwhile, in the sky above Jianghai City, two figures appeared, one burly and muscular, the other tall and thin.</p><p></p><p>"This place should be Jianghai City, right? The human emperor's bloodline that the Tiger God previously detected should be here.</p><p></p><p>Suzan, Moyu, and Iron Ox also disappeared here.</p><p></p><p>Later, that idiot Saimuel came here and also disappeared without a trace."</p><p></p><p>"Correct, this is just a small human city. Logically speaking, there shouldn't be any super experts here.</p><p></p><p>And I also don't sense any powerful aura, so how did Saimuel and the others disappear?"</p><p></p><p>"Forget it, let's go down and take a look. Find a human tongue to interrogate and see if we can get some clues."</p>

        <h1>Chapter 242</h1>
        <div class="content">
            <p>Here is the full English translation of the Chinese excerpt:</p><p></p><p>There, they were all powerful grandmaster-level experts.</p><p></p><p>It was precisely because of the existence of those powerful experts that the ones above did not dare to take a step further down, to cultivate in the lower regions.</p><p></p><p>But now, they were all exterminated by a single human in just over ten seconds - it was truly terrifying.</p><p></p><p>Fortunately, they were quite wise earlier and did not attack that human.</p><p></p><p>Otherwise, it would have been them who died at this moment.</p><p></p><p>In fact, Ye Xiao had indeed killed all the star beasts that attacked him, around one or two hundred of them.</p><p></p><p>If they had not come in batches but all together, Ye Xiao would not have even needed ten seconds.</p><p></p><p>A single thought of his could instantly slay all these star beasts.</p><p></p><p>Of course, these one or two hundred star beasts were not the only grand-master level star beasts in this Tianhuo Cliff.</p><p></p><p>The star beasts in this Tianhuo Cliff were truly too many.</p><p></p><p>Ye Xiao even had the idea of turning this place into his own breeding ground. After all, there were so many star beasts here, with a complete variety and abundant resources.</p><p></p><p>If he could turn this into a breeding ground, wouldn't he be able to have a sumptuous feast every day? That would be far better than just eating barbecue, roasted meat, and fried eggs, right?</p><p></p><p>Maybe he could even open a restaurant.</p><p></p><p>Tianhuo Cliff Farmhouse Delicacy.</p><p></p><p>In this world of cultivators, a star beast restaurant is also an extremely popular and profitable business.</p><p></p><p>After all, every cultivator needs to replenish their vital energy.</p><p></p><p>As long as they don't eat the star cores of the star beasts, there is no problem at all.</p><p></p><p>It's just like eating ordinary meat, no different from eating domestic poultry.</p><p></p><p>If one had to give it a definition, it would be wild game versus domestic.</p><p></p><p>The former is actually more advantageous.</p><p></p><p>But thinking about it, he's not really interested in money, so what's the use of a profitable restaurant? Moreover, the ordinary star beasts can indeed be eaten.</p><p></p><p>But not the ones here.</p><p></p><p>The star beasts here are not just simple energy bodies like spirit herbs.</p><p></p><p>They have long been corroded by the evil Qi, from their souls to their physical bodies, from the inside out, they have all been contaminated.</p><p></p><p>If one eats them casually, they might even contract some unclean diseases.</p><p></p><p>So it's better to be cautious, just refine them into medicinal pills.</p><p></p><p>Ye Xiao collected their star cores and flesh, but not too much, after all, he still needs to leave space for the grand feast below.</p><p></p><p>After descending another ten thousand zhang, Ye Xiao finally arrived at the bottom of the Tianhuo Cliff.</p><p></p><p>Down here, it was all white bones, as if it had become an ocean of accumulated oil-white bones, unfathomable in depth!</p><p></p><p>Among them were human bones and star beast bones.</p><p></p><p>Many of the bones were still fresh, one can imagine how many brutal events must happen here every day.</p><p></p><p>These star beasts were completely savage, whether it was humans or their own kind, as long as they felt hungry, they would not spare anyone.</p><p></p><p>Ye Xiao could even sense several powerful auras down below.</p><p></p><p>Each one was not weaker than the Xiantian Sixth-Grade.</p><p></p><p>They were all Divine Patriarchs.</p><p></p><p>This made Ye Xiao's eyes light up, revealing an excited expression.</p><p></p><p>If he could gather all these powerful star beasts and refine them into medicinal pills, how wonderful would that be?</p><p></p><p>With so much energy, it should be enough for him to break through to the final realm, right?</p><p></p><p>Thinking of this, Ye Xiao released his powerful blood Qi energy.</p><p></p><p>He was baiting them.</p><p></p><p>Using himself as bait to lure these powerful star beasts to approach him.</p><p></p><p>The scent of a human, for star beasts, is irresistible.</p><p></p><p>Especially for a very powerful human, with his strong and abundant blood Qi, it is simply a fatal attraction to the star beasts!</p><p></p><p>It could drive them to madness with envy.</p><p></p><p>Devouring Ye Xiao could very likely propel them to an even higher level of cultivation.</p><p></p><p>The moment Ye Xiao released his aura, he sensed several powerful auras approaching, their spiritual senses already searching for his location.</p><p></p><p>Ye Xiao stood proudly above the sea of bones, the Taixuan Tiangong rotating at a frequency of over a thousand times per second, quietly waiting for the arrival of those star beasts.</p><p></p><p>Two hundred kilometers away, a blood lake with floating white skulls suddenly erupted, and a huge head emerged, thicker than a truck.</p><p></p><p>It was a massive Heavenly Python.</p><p></p><p>It was frantically flicking its huge, deep red, and even slightly purple forked tongue, frantically sniffing Ye Xiao's blood Qi in the air, and letting out a series of hissing sounds.</p><p></p><p>That was it frantically absorbing massive amounts of air, creating a vacuum area due to the sudden absorption, causing this phenomenon.</p><p></p><p>"The scent of a human! This blood Qi, so rich! This human, I must have him!"</p><p></p><p>Three hundred kilometers to the southwest, a huge blue wolf roared as it charged out of a pile of bone mountains, its eerie green pupils flashing ominously in the darkness.</p><p></p><p>"Such powerful blood Qi! If I can devour this fellow, I will surely be able to step into the Xiantian Ninth-Grade."</p><p></p><p>In the north, a gale flashed in the darkness, and a massive vulture-like star beast landed on a bone mountain.</p><p></p><p>"Mingdie, have you caught the scent of that powerful blood Qi?"</p><p></p><p>Beneath the bone mountains,</p><p></p><p>Here is the full English translation of the Chinese excerpt:</p><p></p><p>From a massive cocoon, a calm voice emerged.</p><p></p><p>"So it's been discovered, so what?"</p><p></p><p>"Don't you have any thoughts about this? With such rich spiritual energy, if we two could devour it, our powers would definitely rise to a new level. This would greatly benefit our status in the Demon Cliff."</p><p></p><p>"Kasuo, you're thinking too simply. Haven't you noticed the peculiarity in this?"</p><p></p><p>"Are you saying that this human is deliberately luring the Godly Sect's experts here, that this is a trap?"</p><p></p><p>"Don't you believe it?"</p><p></p><p>"Whether it's a trap or not doesn't matter. What matters is that this is the bottom of the Demon Cliff! Even if he has set up some kind of trap, do you think it would be of any use? At the bottom of the Demon Cliff, there are a full twenty-one Godly Sect's spirit beasts! If we powerful experts all mobilize, even if this human's strength is formidable, he would still be nothing more than a fish on the chopping board."</p><p></p><p>"But what if all the Godly Sect's spirit beasts mobilize? Then to whom would this human belong? Aren't you afraid that with so many Godly Sect experts, they would start fighting among themselves?</p><p></p><p>Kasuo, don't go get involved in this matter. </p><p>Believe me, my intuition tells me that if we go, we will die a miserable death."</p><p></p><p>Kasuo was unconcerned.</p><p></p><p>"Mingdie, your courage is too small. When faced with such easy prey, you don't even dare to eat. Don't you find that ridiculous?</p><p></p><p>It's true that what you said makes sense, the other Godly Sect experts definitely won't let this easy prey slip by either.</p><p></p><p>But we're not that stupid, to start fighting among ourselves just for the sake of a human.</p><p>At the very least, everyone will fight to kill him first, before competing for the spoils."</p><p></p><p>"I've said my piece, if you insist on going, I can't stop you. But don't bother telling me more, I'm not going."</p><p></p><p>"Tch! Coward!"</p><p></p><p>Kasuo spat, spread his wings, and flew like a hurricane towards Ye Xiao's direction.</p><p></p><p>At the same time, not only him, but powerful spirit beasts from the east, west, and other directions, were all converging on this place.</p><p></p><p>Soon, two fierce figures simultaneously appeared on both sides of Ye Xiao, keeping a certain distance from him.</p><p></p><p>"So it really is a human. Hahaha, the master hasn't tasted the flesh of such a spiritually vibrant human in many years. It seems I'll be in for a treat today."</p><p></p><p>As he spoke, two or three more figures flew over from other directions.</p><p></p><p>"Dragon Demon, don't be so presumptuous, the right to claim him isn't yours alone. We haven't even spoken yet."</p><p></p><p>Dragon Demon sneered coldly.</p><p></p><p>"You little trash dares to compete with the master? You're really courting death.</p><p>At the bottom of the Demon Cliff, how many dare to go against the master?"</p><p></p><p>"I wonder if I count?"</p><p></p><p>Just as Dragon Demon's words fell, a giant python the size of a truck also arrived by Ye Xiao's side.</p><p></p><p>Its voice thundered like lightning, and when it spoke, the surrounding air seemed to be instantly sucked into its mouth, as if being drawn into a black hole.</p><p>Just hearing that kind of voice was enough to make one feel a chill, causing goosebumps to rise.</p><p></p><p>Dragon Demon snorted lightly.</p><p></p><p>"Heavenly Python, it would be a waste for us to fight. Especially over a mere human. If we two join forces to subdue this human, we can split him evenly, how about it?"</p><p></p><p>"Hahaha, Dragon Demon, although your temper doesn't suit my taste, I have to admit, your proposal this time is quite clever.</p><p>Alright! Today, the master will join forces with you once, and we'll split this human evenly."</p><p></p><p>The other Godly Sect spirit beasts had expressions ranging from displeased to grim.</p><p>They all had a strong desire for the present Ye Xiao.</p><p></p><p>But Dragon Demon and Heavenly Python's strength at the bottom of the Demon Cliff was terrifying, almost able to occupy the top five positions.</p><p>So with the two of them joining forces, the other Godly Sect experts had no choice but to carefully consider the situation.</p><p></p><p>But in the blink of an eye, several even stronger auras came rushing from other directions, looking at the two of them and couldn't help but tease:</p><p></p><p>"When did you two become the overlords of the Demon Cliff? How come we didn't know about it?"</p><p></p><p>This voice immediately made Dragon Demon and Heavenly Python's expressions fluctuate, looking unpleasant.</p><p>The other Godly Sect experts revealed mocking smiles.</p><p></p><p>"Hehe, even Thunder Azure Ox and Eight-Legged Steed have arrived, now those two can't be so arrogant anymore."</p><p></p><p>As for the large Sect spirit beasts who were secretly watching from afar, they couldn't help but start feeling terrified.</p><p></p><p>"This is too terrifying! The twenty Godly Sect's supreme experts at the Demon Cliff, who haven't gathered together for over a hundred years, have actually assembled today!"</p>

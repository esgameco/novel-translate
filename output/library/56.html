        <h1>Chapter 56</h1>
        <div class="content">
            <p>Here is the full English translation of the Chinese excerpt:</p><p></p><p>"It seems I can only read books again." </p><p></p><p>Ye Xiao did not necessarily need Ning Yuhen's cultivation technique, but when it came to the last one or two basic cultivation techniques in a synthesized cultivation system, they were always the most difficult to find.</p><p></p><p>Because there were too many pirated versions, many cultivation techniques were of the same origin, belonging to the same category of basic techniques.</p><p></p><p>It would be more convenient to not directly obtain Ning Yuhen's particular technique.</p><p></p><p>But it's not as if, aside from Ning Yuhen's technique, he couldn't find the last similar healing-type basic technique.</p><p></p><p>After all, this is like a spring, if you keep digging, the water will still flow out.</p><p></p><p>For now, it's best to have a bite to eat and go home to sleep.</p><p></p><p>On the other side, after leaving the library, Ning Yuhen's mind was in a state of panic.</p><p></p><p>"Why did the manager ask me about the cultivation technique? Has he already discovered something? But how could the manager, who is only at the Xiantian Second Rank, see through me when his cultivation is far inferior to mine?"</p><p></p><p>Ning Yuhen clenched his fists. If that was the case, then he could no longer stay here.</p><p></p><p>His secret absolutely could not be discovered, otherwise he would have nowhere to go.</p><p></p><p>The words had just left his mouth when a nightmare-like voice suddenly rang in his ear.</p><p></p><p>"Ning Yuhen, we've finally found you."</p><p></p><p>Ning Yuhen's pupils constricted, and all the hair on his body stood on end.</p><p></p><p>He stared intently at the two young people not far in front of him, his face filled with terror.</p><p></p><p>One was a fat man without a neck, his whole body seemingly about to ooze oil.</p><p></p><p>The other was an extremely burly man, his body covered in bulging muscles, as if his skin was about to burst at any moment.</p><p></p><p>The only similarity was that both of their pupils had an unusual color.</p><p></p><p>One was a frog-like gradient of green and yellow, with black specks inside.</p><p>The other was a yellowish-brown wolf-like pupil.</p><p></p><p>"What are you doing here?"</p><p></p><p>"We heard someone had spotted you in Jianghai City, so we just wanted to come and check. Unexpectedly, we were able to sense your aura."</p><p></p><p>Ning Yuhen clenched his fists, realizing that it must have been when he used his healing technique to save the cat at noon, leaking his aura.</p><p></p><p>Beastmen are extremely sensitive to each other's auras.</p><p></p><p>"This is the Martial Arts Library in Jianghai City, with martial artists guarding it. Can you two afford the consequences of causing trouble here?"</p><p></p><p>The two looked at each other and smiled.</p><p></p><p>"You've been living with humans for too long, have you started to think of yourself as human? Don't forget, you also have the bloodline of a star beast. If the humans discover you, you'll meet the same fate."</p><p></p><p>"Are you coming back to the Beast God Sect with us, or do we have to drag you back by force?"</p><p></p><p>Their relentless pressure made Ning Yuhen clench his teeth, his expression extremely grim, yet unable to refute them.</p><p></p><p>It's true that as someone with the same star beast bloodline, he would also be despised by humans, and the guards would come after him. He could certainly shake off these two, but that would only lead to an even greater crisis for himself.</p><p></p><p>But to return to that place, he would rather die than go back. That place was a living hell!</p><p></p><p>After a moment, Ning Yuhen took a deep breath and said solemnly:</p><p></p><p>"Alright, I'll go with you. But let me go to my dorm to get my things first. Are you coming with me, or...?"</p><p></p><p>The fat one with frog-like eyes was about to follow, but the muscular one stretched out his hand to stop him.</p><p></p><p>"Let him go by himself, it's not like he can run away anyway."</p><p></p><p>The fat one understood the implication, and a sinister smile appeared on his face.</p><p></p><p>Here is the full English translation of the Chinese excerpt:</p><p></p><p>"Okay, let him go by himself then," he nodded.</p><p></p><p>There were human warriors guarding the library. Once they went in, if Ning Yutian wanted to fight to the death, the two of them would not be able to escape easily. It would be better to wait outside.</p><p></p><p>The reason they agreed to let Ning Yutian go back was also based on this consideration. This was just the entrance of the library, and if they made a move here, it would easily attract the attention of the library guards.</p><p></p><p>There was no need for them to take such a big risk.</p><p></p><p>After all, the half-beasts were extremely sensitive to each other's auras, and the two of them could clearly smell Ning Yutian's aura. Ning Yutian could not possibly slip away from under their noses.</p><p></p><p>"Ning Yutian, don't try any tricks. We're only giving you ten minutes. If we don't see you in ten minutes, the entire library will know you have the blood of a star beast."</p><p></p><p>"I understand."</p><p></p><p>Ning Yutian responded and turned to enter the library.</p><p></p><p>After entering the library, Ning Yutian punched the wall, and since he did not use any spiritual energy, his fist was directly shattered, with blood flowing.</p><p></p><p>"Damn it! The hiding place I just found has been exposed so quickly."</p><p></p><p>But he soon calmed down, because he didn't have much time left.</p><p></p><p>After taking a deep breath, he immediately used the healing art, and the wound on his hand was instantly healed.</p><p></p><p>Back in the dormitory, he organized his salary and a few valuable items, and put them in his backpack.</p><p></p><p>Just as he was about to leave, he suddenly thought of something, paused for a moment, unzipped his backpack, took out a cultivation technique, and placed it under the pillow.</p><p></p><p>Then he sent a text message and immediately put on a baseball cap, went to the back of the dormitory, lifted the manhole cover, and jumped in.</p><p></p><p>In the suburbs of the city, Ye Xiao was drinking donkey meat soup in a restaurant that claimed to have a hundred years of history, when his phone suddenly lit up with a message.</p><p></p><p>He picked up the phone and glanced at it, somewhat surprised.</p><p></p><p>"What is this kid up to?"</p><p></p><p>In the message, Ning Yutian said he had an emergency and needed to go back home, and he left the cultivation technique for Ye Xiao as a thank you for taking care of him all this time.</p><p></p><p>This left Ye Xiao somewhat puzzled.</p><p></p><p>Ning Yutian had previously been quite reluctant to give him the cultivation technique, but now he suddenly agreed to it? </p><p></p><p>And another thing, he's going back home? Why would he suddenly want to go back home?</p><p></p><p>Could it be that... he's encountered some trouble and doesn't plan to come back, so he doesn't have to worry about exposing his star beast bloodline, so he left the cultivation technique for Ye Xiao?</p><p></p><p>Ye Xiao dialed Ning Yutian's number, but no one answered. He sighed, it seems he won't have the chance to see him again.</p><p></p><p>But everyone has their own secrets, he wouldn't pry further.</p><p></p><p>After finishing the donkey meat soup, Ye Xiao paid the bill and left.</p><p></p><p>Without Huan Liuli, eating was much simpler, one person full, the whole family not hungry.</p><p></p><p>"I don't know where that silly cat went, she still hasn't come back. Looks like next time I can't throw her too far away."</p><p></p><p>On the other side, in a quiet and deserted road in the suburbs of Jianghai City, the manhole cover was gently moved aside. Ning Yutian's small head poked out, scanned the surroundings, and seeing no one, he climbed out of the sewer and put the cover back in place.</p><p></p><p>But just as he was about to run, his pupils suddenly constricted. Not far away, the fat man with frog eyes was smiling at him.</p>

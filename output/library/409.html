        <h1>Chapter 409</h1>
        <div class="content">
            <p>Here is the full English translation of the Chinese excerpt:</p><p></p><p>The remaining few were completely devastated.</p><p></p><p>What is this situation? How can this person be so strong? This is not the ancient times! In the ancient times, there were many outstanding figures and powerful experts.</p><p></p><p>But now, even the spiritual energy between heaven and earth has become so scarce, at most it can only be considered the end times!</p><p></p><p>The aura of the other party is only at the Slay God Realm.</p><p></p><p>They believe that the Slay God Realm can easily kill them.</p><p></p><p>But they absolutely do not believe that the Slay God Realm actually possesses so many methods.</p><p></p><p>Amid deep shock and doubt, they were sent away by Ye Xiao.</p><p></p><p>Group ticket.</p><p></p><p>After last night's events, Ye Xiao felt that several auras were rushing towards this place.</p><p></p><p>Obviously, the commotion here has caught the attention of the Ning family.</p><p></p><p>Ye Xiao lightly stepped and instantly disappeared from the spot.</p><p></p><p>Just as he took the first step, a few figures had already arrived here.</p><p></p><p>Sensing the lingering aura in the air, everyone couldn't help but feel a chill.</p><p></p><p>"Someone just died here, judging from the aura, it's at least a Saint Realm expert."</p><p></p><p>"To be able to kill a Saint Realm expert so quietly without leaving any trace of disturbance around, the other party's strength is not simple at all!"</p><p></p><p>"Although the Slay God Realm can also instantly kill Saint Realm experts, it's impossible to be this clean and neat in such a short time."</p><p></p><p>"Nowadays, we Ning family can no longer see through everything in this Jianghai City. Sigh!"</p><p></p><p>At the same time, in the depths of the Ning family, from among the many black jade coffins that were hidden away, a furious roar suddenly erupted from within one of the coffins.</p><p></p><p>"Damn it! Who was it that killed all my subordinates? If they hadn't died, in at most one or two months, they would have recovered to the Slay God Realm cultivation and could have rescued me out of here.</p><p></p><p>Now that they have been slaughtered, it will take me more time to break out of this damn seal!"</p><p></p><p>After a while, his mood finally calmed down.</p><p></p><p>"Never mind, I still have one move left. If I can complete this move, I can also break through this damn seal and escape.</p><p></p><p>Once I get out, I will definitely find the bastard who ruined my plan and devour him alive, fry him in oil until he's dried up!"</p><p></p><p>On Ye Xiao's side, he had already returned to his own residence.</p><p></p><p>He was disappointed!</p><p></p><p>These people were indeed powerful experts from the ancient times.</p><p></p><p>But they didn't know much, or even almost nothing, about how the ancient times were destroyed.</p><p></p><p>Because they were criminals! Including their masters - the Alpha King, the Flame Dragon King, the Thunder King, and the Ten Directions King!</p><p></p><p>These four Saint King experts were sealed in the Saint King Tombs by the Saint Emperor of the Ancient Divine Nation because they had committed serious crimes.</p><p></p><p>The reason they had burial items was only because the Saint Emperor of the Ancient Divine Nation, considering their many years of loyalty, granted them that privilege.</p><p></p><p>In other words, they had already been sealed in the tombs before the Ancient Divine Nation was destroyed.</p><p></p><p>They might not even know about the existence of the Divine Nation's treasure vault.</p><p></p><p>This is also the reason why Ye Xiao felt a bit puzzled before.</p><p></p><p>After all, the Saint King experts in the Ancient Divine Nation should have been qualified to know about this matter.</p><p></p><p>The Healing Saint King knew about this. </p><p></p><p>The Poison King might also know, or he might have known it in his heart but just didn't write it down.</p><p></p><p>So this time, when four Saint King tombs were excavated at once, Ye Xiao originally suspected that someone might know about it, but it turned out that no one knew.</p><p></p><p>It was the luckiest of all luck!</p><p></p><p>However, despite this, he still couldn't be careless.</p><p></p><p>In the starry sky, there are still many ancient divine tombs, and no one knows how many Saint King tombs are hidden among them.</p><p></p><p>If another one or two were to come, it would inevitably expose this matter.</p><p></p><p>It's better to be more cautious.</p><p></p><p>And so, over the next month or so, the days in Jianghai City once again returned to their previous tranquility.</p><p></p><p>Ye Xiao's cultivation also broke through again, reaching the fourth layer of the Slay God Realm.</p><p></p><p>Not bad, still one layer per month, a very stable progress.</p><p></p><p>Normally, the higher the cultivation, the slower the improvement.</p><p></p><p>But now, he has obtained four divine arts:</p><p>the Destruction Art, the Creation Art, the Immortality Art, and the Sky Manipulation Art.</p><p></p><p>The combination of these four divine arts has greatly accelerated his cultivation speed, allowing him to advance rapidly.</p><p></p><p>Of course, he also has the flesh of the Sovereign Beasts and many medicinal pills to assist him.</p><p></p><p>In the later stages when more and more cultivation is required for advancement, Ye Xiao can still maintain a stable cultivation speed, which is quite remarkable.</p><p></p><p>People like Jing Di and the others, even with the White Jade Coffin, can at most increase by one dragon, their speed is far from comparable to Ye Xiao's.</p><p></p><p>Ye Xiao is pondering a question.</p><p></p><p>If his cultivation breaks through to the Saint Emperor Realm in the future, what should he do then? At that time, it might not be possible for him to stay here anymore, perhaps that will be the time for him to leave.</p><p></p><p>"The passage under the Divine Nation's treasure vault has been excavated 70%, there's only 30% left."</p><p></p><p>Here is the full English translation of the Chinese excerpt:</p><p></p><p>Section 30, I originally thought it would take half a year to complete everything. Now it seems that it can all be done in about four months.</p><p></p><p>I really look forward to the things inside! I estimate that the treasures inside can raise my strength to the Godking realm." After a pause, Ye Xiao spoke again:</p><p></p><p>"However, before that, if I could speed up a bit, that would be great. Unfortunately, I don't have any Godking corpses or the like. If I could get a few Godking corpses and extract millions of drops of Godblood to fully absorb and refine into my body, it should be able to rapidly boost my strength again."</p><p></p><p>Unfortunately, the idea is beautiful, but the reality is harsh, the heavens won't just drop a pie for him.</p><p></p><p>Ye Xiao still lived a calm life of going to work, clocking in, and going home after work.</p><p></p><p>This morning, Ye Xiao came to work and was surprised to find that there were very few colleagues who came in today.</p><p></p><p>The 4th floor was already not very crowded to begin with, and Ye Xiao's perception was extremely keen, so he could easily sense this situation.</p><p></p><p>The 4th floor was unusually quiet, with even fewer readers than usual.</p><p></p><p>Just as Ye Xiao was about to find a colleague to ask, suddenly the Thought Stone started trembling, someone was contacting him.</p><p></p><p>Ye Xiao took out the Thought Stone, and the one contacting him was none other than Senior Beitang Ce.</p><p></p><p>"Hello! Senior Beitang, why did you suddenly think to contact me?"</p><p></p><p>On the other end of the Thought Stone, Beitang Ce's voice sounded somewhat serious.</p><p></p><p>"Ye Xiao, we're in big trouble here."</p><p></p><p>Hearing these words, Ye Xiao's expression became slightly grave.</p><p></p><p>Beitang Ce rarely contacted him easily, and for him to say they were in big trouble, there must be a very important matter. </p><p></p><p>It might be something even the XuanYuan Clan could not resolve.</p><p></p><p>"Don't be anxious, just tell me slowly."</p><p></p><p>"Okay!"</p><p></p><p>Beitang Ce took a deep breath and then spoke:</p><p></p><p>"A few days ago, Emperor Jing, Qinglong, Master Xuanwu, and Li Liushui all fell ill one after another, their faces deathly pale like wax, but the cause could not be determined.</p><p></p><p>In the past two days, they have been on the verge of death.</p><p></p><p>Today, Master Baihu and Lu Qingshan also fell ill in succession."</p><p></p><p>"What about the Ning family? Their healing abilities should not be low either, right? Could they not figure out the cause?"</p><p></p><p>"I'm not sure about the specific situation. But what I know is that people from the Ning family have also fallen ill.</p><p></p><p>Including Ning Zhiyuan's second uncle, Ning Yicheng!"</p><p></p><p>Ye Xiao's eyes narrowed slightly.</p><p></p><p>He knew about Ning Zhiyuan's second uncle, whose strength had already reached the Godly Realm Ninth Layer, just one step away from breaking through to the Deicide Realm.</p><p></p><p>That level of existence actually fell ill, it seems this matter is truly not simple.</p><p></p><p>And his colleagues who didn't come to work today, they were most likely affected as well.</p><p></p><p>After thinking it over, Ye Xiao comforted:</p><p></p><p>"Don't be too anxious, I'll go to the hospital and take a look first to see what the situation is."</p><p></p><p>"Okay! But you have to be careful and protect yourself, you are much more important to us than we are."</p><p></p><p>Ye Xiao lightly hummed in acknowledgment, ending the communication with the Thought Stone, and instantly disappeared from the spot, reappearing inside the hospital.</p><p></p><p>The hospital was already filled with patients, all of them without any other symptoms, only their complexions were ashen pale, devoid of blood, their eyes dull and lifeless, unresponsive.</p><p></p><p>Relying on his keen perception, he easily found the ward where Emperor Jing and the others were.</p><p></p><p>They were indeed as Beitang Ce had described, already in a critical condition.</p><p></p><p>Ye Xiao approached them, and they were like in a state of suspended animation, their breathing extremely slow and faint, almost like they were on the verge of death.</p><p></p><p>Ye Xiao used his spiritual power to scan their bodies, but found nothing abnormal, their physical condition was intact, and their blood qi was also unharmed.</p><p></p><p>This was puzzling, their bodies were completely fine, yet they were displaying such a dire condition. It shouldn't be an illness.</p><p></p><p>Ye Xiao activated his Elemental Eyes again, and the next moment, he suddenly discovered the crux of the matter.</p><p></p><p>"This is..."</p><p></p><p>It turned out that for some unknown reason, their blood qi was being devoured by a type of small worm.</p><p></p><p>These small worms were extremely minute, their structure identical to that of Godblood, and they could even mimic Godblood, moving within the body.</p><p></p><p>This way, even if Ye Xiao used spiritual power to scan, he couldn't find any problems, because they were completely indistinguishable from the blood cells, essentially one with the Godblood.</p><p></p><p>And as they continuously moved and multiplied within the body, they were constantly devouring the Godblood.</p><p></p><p>If they reached a certain degree, they might replace the original Godblood in the body, thereby gaining complete control over the person.</p><p></p><p>This was a type of ancient poison!</p><p></p><p>And it was a very old type of poison.</p><p></p><p>Ye Xiao had previously obtained the inheritance manual of the Poison King, so he knew clearly what this poison was.</p><p></p><p>Fifth update, 15,000 words.</p><p></p><p>Please recommend, subscribe, and vote for monthly tickets.</p><p></p><p>(This chapter is complete)</p>

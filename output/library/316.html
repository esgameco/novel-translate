        <h1>Chapter 316</h1>
        <div class="content">
            <p>Here is the full English translation of the Chinese excerpt:</p><p></p><p>"He wants to capture us alive."</p><p></p><p>The half-step Supernormal Star Beast that had just spoken up had already discovered Ye Xiao's intentions.</p><p></p><p>They finally began to panic completely.</p><p></p><p>This Imperial Realm expert of the human race actually wants to capture them alive! They're not fools! Why would the human race want to capture them alive?</p><p></p><p>They are all mortal enemies with each other, so wouldn't it be better to just kill them directly?</p><p></p><p>Although they don't know why Ye Xiao wants to do this, they know that if they are captured by this human, their fate will not be good at all.</p><p></p><p>They cannot be caught by him.</p><p></p><p>Absolutely not!</p><p></p><p>"Retreat quickly!"</p><p></p><p>Several half-step Supernormal Star Beasts immediately transformed into streams of light and fled towards the starry sky.</p><p></p><p>But since Ye Xiao has come in person, how could he possibly let them escape so easily?</p><p></p><p>A punch pierced through the huge body of a star beast, and his left hand grasped the void in the sky, directly activating the Star Picking Hand.</p><p></p><p>The tremendous power instantly confined the sky.</p><p></p><p>The fleeing half-step Supernormal Star Beasts were scared out of their wits.</p><p></p><p>One of the star beasts even directly peed itself in fear.</p><p></p><p>That was a half-step Supernormal-level star beast, which in the human world would be equivalent to a half-step Imperial Realm expert! Yet it was so terrified by Ye Xiao that it peed itself.</p><p></p><p>"He's coming up! Quick! Stop him!"</p><p></p><p>At this moment, all the half-step Supernormals exerted their bloodline suppression to the fullest, forcibly issuing orders to make the Deity Sect, Grand Sect, and Master-level, even those below Master-level star beasts, charge towards Ye Xiao and self-destruct without regard for their lives.</p><p></p><p>Among the star beasts, the higher-level ones can completely command the lower-level ones to self-destruct.</p><p></p><p>Boom, boom, boom. The next moment, countless beams of light began to shine in the sky.</p><p></p><p>Although these star beasts could not possibly pose a threat to Ye Xiao in terms of strength, their numbers were simply too many.</p><p></p><p>In this way, the explosions would greatly disrupt the surrounding spiritual energy domain, causing distortions in the spiritual energy even more terrifying than the previous spiritual energy cannon bombardment.</p><p></p><p>Although it could not hurt Ye Xiao, it would greatly interfere with him, making it difficult for him to easily control those few half-step Supernormals.</p><p></p><p>Ye Xiao's brow furrowed slightly, with a hint of displeasure.</p><p></p><p>"Roar!"</p><p></p><p>The next moment, a thunderous tiger roar resounded.</p><p></p><p>Imperial Art - Roar of the Mountain Forest! One roar, and the clouds retreat.</p><p></p><p>Affected by this sound wave interference, the star beasts below Grand Sect, numbering in the hundreds of millions, all exploded instantly.</p><p></p><p>As for the Grand Sect to Deity Sect experts, their blood also surged, spitting blood, and their entire strength could no longer be mobilized. Under Ye Xiao's thunderous roar of the sound art, they were directly injured and stunned. Ye Xiao then activated the Star Picking Hand again, and countless small Star Picking Hands instantly formed in the air like a giant net, capturing all the star beasts and storing them in Ye Xiao's spatial storage ring.</p><p></p><p>"Let's fight him to the end!"</p><p></p><p>The half-step Supernormal Star Beasts in the sky simultaneously attacked, with several strikes landing on Ye Xiao's head.</p><p></p><p>They did not seek to injure Ye Xiao, only to disrupt his attacks, so that in this moment they could escape from Ye Xiao's Star Picking Hand.</p><p></p><p>Boom, boom, boom. The area where Ye Xiao was standing erupted in several violent explosions, and the turbulent airflow collided with each other, even forming a kind of violent electric wave sound.</p><p></p><p>"Did it succeed?"</p><p></p><p>"No, our bodies still can't flee upwards, we can't unleash our movement techniques, his attacks haven't disappeared!"</p><p></p><p>When the smoke and dust cleared, Ye Xiao's figure reappeared before them, completely unharmed.</p><p></p><p>He patted the dust off his clothes and looked at the few star beasts again, the corner of his mouth slightly rising as he activated the Star Picking Hand, directly pulling them down.</p><p></p><p>This terrifying scene scared the half-step Supernormals in the sky, who were now completely powerless to resist.</p><p></p><p>It's over! They're doomed! This guy is just a freak! They had seen Imperial Realm experts before, but one like this, they had never seen.</p><p></p><p>His defense is so thick, no matter how they explode, they can't hurt him, and his other techniques are endless. Even if they can't defeat him and want to escape, they can't escape either!</p><p></p><p>Seeing that they were being pulled back to Ye Xiao's side, Karsil, the 44th ranked half-step Supernormal Star Beast expert, let out a roar and mobilized all the power within his body.</p><p></p><p>"I am a star beast! Even if I die, I won't be captured alive by you!"</p><p></p><p>Star beasts have the pride of star beasts, and he absolutely will not allow himself to fall into the hands of a human.</p><p></p><p>Moreover, even if he falls into Ye Xiao's hands, he doesn't know what he'll have to go through. Rather than that, it's better to choose to self-destruct directly.</p><p></p><p>One, so that he won't be captured alive by Ye Xiao, and two, so that he can uphold his own integrity.</p><p></p><p>"Karsil!"</p><p></p><p>The other half-step Supernormal Star Beasts, seeing this scene, could not help but have their hearts bleed in pain!</p><p></p><p>Their comrade had self-destructed right before their eyes, forced to self-destruct by a human!</p><p></p><p>What an indignity? What cruelty? But they were completely powerless to retaliate.</p><p></p><p>The only method left was self-destruction.</p><p></p><p>Here is the full English translation of the Chinese excerpt:</p><p></p><p>Kāxī'ěr, learn and follow in Kāxī'ěr's footsteps.</p><p></p><p>I will defend the dignity of being a Star Beast with my life!" "My friends, I will go first and wait for you ahead!" The Moon Goddess suddenly spoke, and the spiritual energy within her body began to mobilize.</p><p></p><p>However, in the next second, she saw another incredibly unbelievable thing.</p><p></p><p>Ye Xiao suddenly grabbed the air, and the blood mist of the self-exploded Kāxī'ěr quickly fused together and was revived.</p><p></p><p>This was Ye Xiao's use of the Eternal Life Technique!</p><p></p><p>Kāxī'ěr is a crocodile, and crocodile meat is tender and low in fat, with a delicious taste, which is a high-quality ingredient. How could Ye Xiao give it up? Moreover, is the crocodile leather belt not fragrant, or is the crocodile leather shoe not tempting enough?</p><p></p><p>Seeing the revived Kāxī'ěr, the other Star Beasts were instantly dumbfounded.</p><p></p><p>What is this situation? Is this a joke with them? Kāxī'ěr was actually revived? Can the dead Star Beasts all be revived?</p><p></p><p>How can they play like this? Don't they even give them a chance to self-explode?</p><p></p><p>This is too much?</p><p></p><p>No wonder, no wonder Ye Xiao had previously stunned or knocked out those Star Beasts, and some were even directly and brutally injured.</p><p></p><p>Since he can so easily revive these guys, he doesn't have to worry about it anymore.</p><p></p><p>Kāxī'ěr: "(灬 )!"</p><p></p><p>He is now completely dumbfounded.</p><p></p><p>"Didn't I die? How am I still here?"</p><p></p><p>All the Star Beasts fell silent for a moment, not knowing how to answer.</p><p></p><p>And Ye Xiao directly sealed the power within their bodies to prevent them from self-exploding again.</p><p></p><p>At this moment, the spiritual energy ships in the sky, due to lack of pilots, also began to slowly descend.</p><p></p><p>The spiritual energy ships themselves have a certain array buffer, so even without a pilot, the descent speed will not be too fast, which is just right, so that the human race can make some modifications later and use them.</p><p></p><p>Xuanwu Venerable and Beitang Ce quickly flew up from below, seeing Ye Xiao, they both couldn't help but breathe a sigh of relief.</p><p></p><p>Just now, the two of them down below had witnessed Ye Xiao's majestic and heroic demeanor, which was truly magnificent. "Ye Xiao! Well done!"</p><p></p><p>"Ye Xiao, this time it's all thanks to you!"</p><p></p><p>"If you hadn't come, we in the Central Plains would really have been unable to defend."</p><p></p><p>Ye Xiao nodded.</p><p></p><p>"Enough said, the situation in the Southwest Forest Sea is not very optimistic either. You take all the spiritual energy cannons on the spiritual energy ships and place them on the ground. If the Star Beasts attack again, you can directly bombard them with the spiritual energy cannons. I can't help you repair the array now, I..."</p><p></p><p>Before he could finish speaking, Ye Xiao suddenly stopped speaking, and he immediately looked up at the sky, his face somewhat grave.</p><p></p><p>"Ye Xiao, what's wrong?"</p><p></p><p>Ye Xiao spoke word by word:</p><p></p><p>"There are enemies coming, very strong!"</p><p></p><p>The two of them couldn't help but have a heavy heart.</p><p></p><p>"Ye Xiao, could it be... a Super Deity Realm Star Beast expert?"</p><p></p><p>For Ye Xiao, who was already an Emperor Realm existence, to have such a serious expression, it could only be a Super Deity Realm expert that was comparable to the human race's Emperor Realm.</p><p></p><p>Ye Xiao did not directly answer them, but said indifferently:</p><p></p><p>"Go hide below, don't come out."</p><p></p><p>Beitang Ce and Xuanwu Venerable Jiang Chen looked at each other, both seeing the gravity in each other's eyes.</p><p></p><p>"Then Ye Xiao, take care."</p><p></p><p>In the next moment, the two immediately retreated.</p><p></p><p>Ye Xiao's mind stirred, and he condensed a clone with his own spiritual energy.</p><p></p><p>This clone, although it did not have the Emperor Realm cultivation of the original, also had the strength of nearly Emperor Realm. And he can use some of Ye Xiao's techniques and divine arts, which are enough to help the Southwest Forest Sea break through the predicament, no problem.</p><p></p><p>Kāxī'ěr and the other Star Beasts were excited.</p><p></p><p>"It's our Super Deity expert who has come! This time, you're dead for sure."</p><p></p><p>"The human race will perish! Even if you have one more Emperor Realm, how can you withstand it? Our Star Beast clan now has a total of twenty-one Super Deity experts! If we refine the blood essence of the people in the various states, we will surely give birth to another batch of Super Deity Star Beast experts! Can you withstand it? You can't withstand it at all!"</p><p></p><p>Ye Xiao looked at them, his eyes flickering, and a cold light burst forth, instantly severing the throats of several Half-Step Super Deity Star Beasts!</p><p></p><p>This level of injury will not kill them, but will prevent them from making any more sounds.</p><p></p><p>Afterwards, Ye Xiao waved his hand and directly absorbed them all into his spatial ring.</p><p></p><p>At the same time, the clouds in the sky also began to quickly gather, and the atmosphere began to condense into a super-giant vortex channel.</p><p></p><p>The scale of this level can only be triggered by a Super Deity Realm expert.</p><p></p><p>Normally, this level of existence would not be able to break through the defenses set up by the human race's ancestors.</p><p></p><p>But now, the human race has opened up a part of the defensive barrier themselves to relieve some of the pressure from the Star Battlefield, so the Super Deity experts can come to the human realm!</p>

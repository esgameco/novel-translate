        <h1>Chapter 90</h1>
        <div class="content">
            <p>Here is the full English translation of the Chinese excerpt:</p><p></p><p>About ten minutes later, the two people from the other side walked out of the hotel.</p><p></p><p>Qin Yuyan quietly spoke:</p><p></p><p>"When she went in just now, it seemed she was wearing black stockings, but now they're gone."</p><p></p><p>Ye Xiao nodded.</p><p></p><p>"Her knees are also red."</p><p></p><p>"I don't want to meet him anymore."</p><p></p><p>"I don't want to meet her anymore either."</p><p></p><p>"Then let's go."</p><p></p><p>Qin Yuyan spoke lightly, and Ye Xiao nodded again.</p><p></p><p>The two quickly left the breakfast shop and came to the street, where the air was a little better.</p><p></p><p>Qin Yuyan took a deep breath, and her mood became much more relaxed.</p><p></p><p>"Are you going home now?"</p><p></p><p>Ye Xiao shook his head.</p><p></p><p>"I'm going to the library to read."</p><p></p><p>Qin Yuyan couldn't help but feel a bit surprised.</p><p></p><p>"When you work at the library every day, aren't you always reading books? Why do you still want to read books on your day off?"</p><p></p><p>Ye Xiao spoke lightly:</p><p></p><p>"There's nothing else to do, so why not read books?"</p><p></p><p>"Is there anything special about reading books? For example, does it have any influence on martial arts cultivation?"</p><p></p><p>"It should have. Isn't there a saying that goes, 'Reading ten thousand volumes, cultivating as if you have a divine power'?"</p><p></p><p>"Is there such a saying?"</p><p></p><p>Qin Yuyan couldn't help but frown slightly. She felt like that saying wasn't quite right, but it was also possible that she had remembered it incorrectly.</p><p></p><p>"Since that's the case, then I'll go back."</p><p></p><p>Ye Xiao didn't try to stop her.</p><p></p><p>"Okay, goodbye."</p><p></p><p>After saying this indifferent sentence, he turned and left, and Huanliuli waved its little paws at Qin Yuyan from his shoulder.</p><p></p><p>Qin Yuyan smiled and waved back, then turned and left.</p><p></p><p>This little incident didn't affect Ye Xiao's mood at all.</p><p></p><p>He didn't want to participate in the blind date in the first place, and he really didn't care what the other party was doing.</p><p></p><p>What he cared about was coming to the library to study his artifact forging techniques and learn more about artifact forging.</p><p></p><p>However, finding materials on artifact forging wasn't going very smoothly.</p><p></p><p>There were many books on artifact forging in the library, but the variety wasn't that great.</p><p></p><p>Ye Xiao had been looking at them occasionally, but so far, the Golden Book of Divine Souls had only collected five such books.</p><p></p><p>This quantity was probably still far from enough for the fusion.</p><p></p><p>As it approached noon, the librarian Ouyang walked over, his expression obviously displeased.</p><p></p><p>"Ye Xiao, why did you leave by yourself this morning? Linlin said she couldn't find you anywhere."</p><p></p><p>Ye Xiao closed the book and spoke indifferently:</p><p></p><p>"When I went there this morning, I ran into Miss Qin Yuyan. She was also going on a blind date, and then I saw your great-niece Linlin and her blind date partner go into a hotel. If the librarian doesn't believe me, you can call Miss Qin to ask."</p><p></p><p>Ouyang's old face immediately darkened.</p><p></p><p>"Is that so?"</p><p></p><p>Ye Xiao nodded.</p><p></p><p>"I have no reason to lie to you."</p><p></p><p>After carefully scrutinizing Ye Xiao for a while and seeing that he didn't seem to be lying, Ouyang's expression finally eased, and he apologized to Ye Xiao.</p><p></p><p>"I'm sorry, Xiao Ye, I didn't expect this kind of thing to happen. It was my fault."</p><p></p><p>Ye Xiao shook his head.</p><p></p><p>"The librarian doesn't need to blame himself. After all, she's just your great-niece, not someone you raised yourself. It's understandable that you don't know her background."</p><p></p><p>"Regardless, this is still my fault. Anyway, I have a membership card for the Huaxi Theater breakfast, and there's still some money on it. Consider it as a way for me to make it up to you."</p><p></p><p>Here is the full English translation of the Chinese excerpt:</p><p></p><p>"Let me make it up to you a bit," said Ouyang Yunzhong, as she stuffed a card into Ye Xiao's pocket without further ado.</p><p></p><p>Her gaze then fell on the book Ye Xiao was reading, and she couldn't help but exclaim, "Ah, you're reading about the art of forging?"</p><p></p><p>"Yes, I've been quite interested in it recently," Ye Xiao replied.</p><p></p><p>"Learning the art of forging would be quite good for you. Your cultivation base is still low, and you haven't awakened your divine soul, so you're not suited for cultivating combat techniques. But if you can cultivate forging techniques or pill-refining techniques, as well as healing arts, you'll have many better job options even if you leave the library."</p><p></p><p>Ouyang Yunzhong picked up the book.</p><p></p><p>"This forging technique is just a common-level one. Forging is quite broad, but the higher-level forging techniques have always been mastered by only a few. </p><p></p><p>The library here doesn't have many books, but if you were at the Shaolin Martial Arts Academy, you'd definitely be able to learn some more profound forging techniques.</p><p></p><p>I'm not trying to deceive you. You know that human cultivation techniques are all researched from the star cores of star beasts.</p><p></p><p>Shaolin has long ago cultivated many powerful experts who entered the star battlefield to hunt and slay powerful star beasts, obtaining a great many star cores, from which they researched many techniques.</p><p></p><p>After thousands of years of development, the people of Shaolin have both those who join the military and their own independent mercenary groups, slaying more and more star beasts and obtaining ever more techniques.</p><p></p><p>So there's the saying, 'All martial arts under heaven come from Shaolin.'"</p><p></p><p>Ye Xiao's expression remained indifferent, unswayed.</p><p></p><p>"I know my own abilities, so I needn't embarrass myself."</p><p></p><p>No matter how good the Shaolin Martial Arts Academy was, attending school still had many rules.</p><p></p><p>Where could he be freer than in the library?</p><p></p><p>Not having to do anything, yet having money! Could there be a better job than this?</p><p></p><p>Furthermore, he only needed to study techniques related to his own cultivation. He didn't need to look at overly profound ones.</p><p></p><p>Previously, Fazheng had given him the Golden Bell Covering and the Golden Book, and after studying them, he had only extracted their basic techniques.</p><p></p><p>As long as it doesn't hinder his own growth, it's all the same wherever he is.</p><p></p><p>Ouyang Yunzhong sighed softly. She truly felt regretful for Ye Xiao.</p><p></p><p>For ordinary people, getting into the Luzhou Shaolin Martial Arts Academy was no easy feat. Yet Ye Xiao was wasting such a good opportunity.</p><p></p><p>"Alright then, I was just feeling regretful and couldn't help but persuade you a bit.</p><p></p><p>Since you don't want to go to Shaolin, why don't you go take a look at the upper levels of the library? There are some better forging techniques there as well."</p><p></p><p>Ye Xiao was slightly taken aback, looking at Ouyang Yunzhong, who then smiled and said, "Don't look at me like that. Although your strength isn't enough to go to the upper levels, I've given you permission. After all, you're an elder of the library. And I also feel a bit embarrassed about how the matchmaking turned out."</p><p></p><p>"Then, thank you, Madam Librarian."</p><p></p><p>Ye Xiao didn't bother with any courtesies.</p><p></p><p>He didn't care whether the techniques on the upper levels were strong or weak. What he cared about was the unique origins of the techniques, so that he could cultivate a few more forging techniques and then fuse them into an exceptionally powerful technique.</p><p></p><p>Ouyang Yunzhong smiled.</p><p></p><p>"No problem, go on. But don't forget to eat lunch. Staring at books all day isn't good for your health."</p><p></p><p>"Understood," Ye Xiao responded, took the list, and quickly made his way to the fourth floor of the library.</p><p></p><p>(End of this chapter)</p>

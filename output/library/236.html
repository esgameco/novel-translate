        <h1>Chapter 236</h1>
        <div class="content">
            <p>Here is the full English translation of the Chinese excerpt:</p><p></p><p>The "Myriad Swords Converge" technique is actually a pretty good move.</p><p></p><p>But as the saying goes, whether a technique is powerful or not ultimately depends on the person using it. The reason Ye Xiao was just able to defeat the "Myriad Swords Converge" was mainly because he combined two Emperor-level sword techniques.</p><p></p><p>If he hadn't used the "Heavenly Slash" to empower the "Imperial Extreme Sword Technique", Ye Xiao wouldn't have been able to easily defeat his opponent, and might have even lost.</p><p></p><p>This is because the "Heavenly Slash" doesn't have long endurance, while the "Imperial Extreme Sword Technique" gradually amplifies in power, so it couldn't instantly reach the strength of 108 swords.</p><p></p><p>If Ye Xiao used the "Heavenly Slash" to empower the "Myriad Swords Converge", he could achieve an effect far surpassing the original "Myriad Swords Converge".</p><p></p><p>Furthermore, now that he has the "Myriad Swords Converge", Ye Xiao essentially possesses three Emperor-level sword techniques.</p><p></p><p>In that case, once his cultivation reaches the King Realm, he'll be able to directly synthesize an incredibly powerful technique that surpasses the Emperor-level.</p><p></p><p>Currently, among the techniques Ye Xiao has, the Healing Art is already maxed out, including the Dawn Star Technique, Extreme Healing Art, and Replenish the Heavens Art.</p><p></p><p>He also has two Body Techniques, and just needs one more to synthesize a complete set.</p><p></p><p>Now he also has three Emperor-level sword techniques to synthesize. With all this, reaching the King Realm seems very promising!</p><p></p><p>As for poison techniques, Ye Xiao had never considered them before, as he felt they were underhanded and had slow effects. </p><p></p><p>But now that he's refined the Devour Spirit Incantation, he might as well practice it - who knows, it might come in handy in the future.</p><p></p><p>This way, he's essentially harvested two more techniques.</p><p></p><p>Next up is the flesh.</p><p></p><p>In fact, if Ye Xiao could refine them into medicinal pills, that would be perfect! Because that would definitely boost his cultivation significantly.</p><p></p><p>However, he can't do that.</p><p></p><p>Refining them into pills requires the blood, flesh, and soul cores of star beasts. Relying on just the flesh alone won't work.</p><p></p><p>But if he takes their soul cores, these two creatures won't be able to revive, and with just their flesh, they won't be able to provide the Zhongzhou City with enough spiritual energy. That would be extremely destructive for the city.</p><p></p><p>There are so many cultivators here - if the spiritual energy supply decreases, their cultivation speed will plummet. This would trigger a chain reaction, slowing down their advancement, making it impossible to deal with future beast disasters.</p><p></p><p>Ye Xiao isn't a deity - he can't instantly eliminate all the star beasts in the world. Each region's beast disasters still need to be resolved by the local cultivators.</p><p></p><p>If he steals these two star beasts' soul cores for his own benefit, it could end up causing the deaths of countless people! That would be too selfish.</p><p></p><p>However, eating a bit of their flesh, while not enough for refining pills, can still provide a similar effect. If that's not enough, he can eat a bit more.</p><p></p><p>Ye Xiao quickly revived them both, starting with the Poisonous Dragon Scorpion Lord, since its strength is lower, making it more convenient for him to harvest its flesh.</p><p></p><p>The Poisonous Dragon Scorpion Lord, whose consciousness had fallen into darkness, suddenly felt a warm, sacred light enter his mind. This light reminded him of the embrace of his mother when he was first born.</p><p></p><p>"Such a holy light! So comfortable!"</p><p></p><p>The Poisonous Dragon Scorpion Lord slowly extended his large pincers.</p><p></p><p>But moments later, the light began to fade, and he found himself in a sealed space, facing Ye Xiao and the split-in-half Sword Dragon Aluo Shatan.</p><p></p><p>Poisonous Dragon Scorpion Lord: "Damn it!"</p><p></p><p>After a brief silence, he couldn't help but ask:</p><p></p><p>"Is this... the underworld? Have you two met your end together?"</p><p></p><p>Ye Xiao's response was two sword beams that directly severed the Poisonous Dragon Scorpion Lord's head, then stored the body in his spatial ring.</p><p></p><p>The excruciating pain made the Poisonous Dragon Scorpion Lord regain his senses. This wasn't the underworld, and Ye Xiao and Aluo Shatan hadn't met their end together. Ye Xiao had killed them both! And this was inside a human tribe's sealing array, where he had been confined in the past to serve as a focus for their spiritual energy gathering array.</p><p></p><p>Damn it, this guy is so strong? Even Aluo Shatan wasn't his match. Has he already become the legendary human King Realm expert? But his head won't be able to ponder these messy thoughts for much longer.</p><p></p><p>Because Ye Xiao used his Healing Art to restore him again. </p><p></p><p>Before the Poisonous Dragon Scorpion Lord could fully comprehend what was happening, Ye Xiao struck with his sword once more.</p><p></p><p>Poisonous Dragon Scorpion Lord: "What the...?!"</p><p></p><p>What is this guy doing? Has he gone mad? Repeatedly reviving him only to cut off his body? This torture is too much!</p><p></p><p>After being cut seven times, he finally understood - Ye Xiao wasn't trying to torture him, but to harvest his blood and flesh, as star beast blood contains abundant spiritual energy. By absorbing his flesh, Ye Xiao could strengthen himself.</p><p></p><p>But this is too much! Taking advantage of his Healing Art to ruthlessly exploit him like this? And he won't even spare a measly scorpion? Is he even human anymore? Beasts are far more righteous than him!</p><p></p><p>Here is the full English translation of the Chinese excerpt:</p><p></p><p>Suddenly, he started to regret.</p><p></p><p>He regretted why he had escaped from Shaolin? Regretted why he had come to Zhongzhou City?</p><p></p><p>If he had not escaped from Shaolin, or if he had not come to Zhongzhou City, he would not have encountered this evil freak.</p><p></p><p>Now, not only was he repeatedly having his flesh cut, but he was also going to be re-sealed in the Gathering Spirit Formation, which was a hundred times more tragic than being in Shaolin!</p><p></p><p>Fortunately, he was just a scorpion, and just as he was about to start cursing, Ye Xiao stopped cutting his flesh.</p><p></p><p>"I'll let you off for now, I still need to put Azio Zhatuo's flesh and blood in my spatial storage ring, consider yourself lucky."</p><p></p><p>The Venomous Dragon Scorpion Lord retreated to the corner with tears in his eyes. On Ye Xiao's side, his gaze quickly fell on Azio Zhatuo, because Azio Zhatuo's strength was relatively strong, so he summoned a great dragon, moved quickly, cut the flesh, revived him, then cut the flesh again, collected it all, and then left, sealing the formation with the Heavenly Dipper Formation.</p><p></p><p>Perfect!</p><p></p><p>In the darkness, Azio Zhatuo's consciousness was drifting in a haze.</p><p></p><p>At this moment, a warm beam of light suddenly appeared in the darkness.</p><p></p><p>That beam of light drove away the cold darkness, making him feel warmth and hope.</p><p></p><p>Involuntarily, he stretched out his hooves to touch the warm light.</p><p></p><p>The next moment, he was back in a very familiar place.</p><p></p><p>The Gathering Spirit Formation and Sealing Formation in Zhongzhou City! He had been here for hundreds of years, so no one was more familiar with this place than him.</p><p></p><p>Could it be that he had been placed in the Gathering Spirit Formation by the human race again? But thinking about it carefully, it made sense, the human race had always needed to use his body as the formation's eye.</p><p></p><p>However, he didn't expect that the human race would even revive him.</p><p></p><p>Hmph, the greedy human race, in order to let him continue to release his residual energy and absorb more spiritual energy for them, they actually revived him again.</p><p></p><p>They were even greedier than the most greedy dragon race in the Star Beasts.</p><p></p><p>Then the next moment, he suddenly felt a pain in his neck, his eyes went dark, and his consciousness sank into darkness again.</p><p></p><p>Then very quickly, he was restored to his original state, and once again his neck was severed.</p><p></p><p>What's going on?</p><p></p><p>What the hell are the human race doing?</p><p></p><p>Until the eighth time, when his head was raised high, he saw Ye Xiao, the one he feared and hated the most, standing on his back, wielding that thing, whether it was a knife or a sword, and chopping off his head.</p><p></p><p>On the ground, there were several of his own corpses, and his muddled head seemed to finally understand what was happening.</p><p></p><p>Damn it!</p><p></p><p>This human race, was actually shearing the sheep's wool! Using healing techniques to restore himself, then slaughtering him and leaving the flesh behind.</p><p></p><p>He was a Ninth Grade Innate Realm Star Beast, almost at the Divine Realm, his blood and flesh contained a large amount of blood qi.</p><p></p><p>This human race, actually wanted to use him to break through? No! He would not allow it! "Human"</p><p></p><p>"Race"</p><p></p><p>"I"</p><p></p><p>"Damn"</p><p></p><p>"You"</p><p></p><p>After cursing a full sentence, he revived again, only to find that Ye Xiao had taken away all his flesh and blood, and revived him.</p><p></p><p>Azio Zhatuo was so angry that he coughed up blood, and immediately roared:</p><p></p><p>"Where is that person? Where is that bastard? Come out!"</p><p></p><p>The Venomous Dragon Scorpion Lord said in a low voice, "He has already left and sealed the formation."</p><p></p><p>Azio Zhatuo was truly enraged this time.</p><p></p><p>"Damn human race! Don't let me see you again! If I see you again, I'll make you regret it!"</p><p></p><p>He let out an earth-shattering roar, but unfortunately, under the seal, he couldn't even transmit it out.</p><p></p><p>After obtaining a large amount of Star Beast flesh, Ye Xiao finally bid farewell to Beitang Ce and returned to the hotel.</p><p></p><p>This trip to Zhongzhou was truly a big harvest.</p><p></p><p>First, he had synthesized a Cultivating Soul Technique, immortal and indestructible, which could continuously cultivate his own soul.</p><p></p><p>Then he also obtained a Supreme Technique, the Myriad Swords Converge, completing the three great Supreme Techniques.</p><p></p><p>As for the Devouring Soul Incantation, it was just a bonus.</p><p></p><p>And there was a large amount of Star Beast flesh.</p><p></p><p>One was the Ninth Grade Venomous Dragon Scorpion Lord, the other was the Half-Divine Beast Azio Zhatuo, it was easy to imagine how his blood qi would be elevated in the future.</p><p></p><p>Oh yes, he seemed to have another spoil of war before.</p><p></p><p>The Ninth Grade Spiritual Ancestor-level Shadowbat.</p><p></p><p>"I almost forgot about it."</p><p></p><p>Ye Xiao immediately took out the Shadowbat's corpse from his storage ring and scanned its star core with the Mysterious Heaven Dipper.</p><p></p><p>But unfortunately, the Shadowbat's star core only had a spiritual system innate technique, and it was exactly the same as the Mysterious Heaven Dipper, unable to be recorded in the Golden Book of the Divine Soul.</p><p></p><p>Thinking about it carefully, it also made sense, if even a stupid and trash Star Beast like the Shadowbat could have a good technique, it would be too unfair to the other Star Beasts.</p><p></p><p>However, Ye Xiao was not disappointed.</p><p></p><p>Because it could still be used to refine medicinal pills. Ninth Grade medicinal pills should be able to significantly increase his blood qi as well, right?</p><p></p><p>Overall, he had still gained a lot.</p><p></p><p>Seven updates, 20,001.</p><p></p><p>Please recommend, vote for monthly tickets, and subscribe.</p><p></p><p>Thank you to the readers Bundled and New Song Not Good for their donations, greatly appreciated.</p><p></p><p>(This chapter is complete)</p>

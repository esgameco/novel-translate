        <h1>Chapter 388</h1>
        <div class="content">
            <p>Here is the full English translation of the Chinese excerpt:</p><p></p><p>Upon hearing the words of the Underworld Wolf, the Big Fish couldn't help but sneer.</p><p></p><p>If he could escape, he would have already found a way to do so long ago. </p><p></p><p>It was precisely because he had seen through all this that he had chosen to stop cultivating and just lie down.</p><p></p><p>In the past, he had resolved to escape within thirty years.</p><p></p><p>This world is just like that - if life has grabbed hold of your legs, rather than struggling angrily, it's better to just lie down and enjoy it.</p><p></p><p>After all, you're only getting your flesh cut a little bit every day, it's not like you'll die.</p><p></p><p>Furthermore, even if you want to die, you can't! The other side has healing arts, so if you die, they can revive you.</p><p></p><p>The levels of the two sides are simply not on the same plane.</p><p></p><p>Seeing that the Big Fish didn't seem to fully believe his words, the Underworld Wolf didn't bother explaining further.</p><p></p><p>He was firmly convinced that his future would definitely be successful.</p><p></p><p>However, at that moment, Ye Xiao dragged a woman into the cellar.</p><p></p><p>The Underworld Wolf and the Big Fish glanced over, both unable to resist sneering.</p><p></p><p>Humans are truly shallow, especially men - sometimes their brains aren't even up top, but down below.</p><p></p><p>But just as they were thinking this, the next moment, Ye Xiao struck with a palm, piercing the other's chest.</p><p></p><p>Underworld Wolf: "(⊙.⊙)!"</p><p>Big Fish: "(⊙.⊙)!"</p><p></p><p>They had heard before that whether human or divine, if they were to perform this kind of blood lineage ritual to have a woman bear a child, the man would definitely make the woman bleed.</p><p></p><p>They never expected it to be true.</p><p></p><p>Goodness, to perpetuate their own bloodline and have a child, how terrifying! It's a good thing they weren't human, or else they wouldn't be able to bear it.</p><p></p><p>However, for this Ye Xiao to do this in front of the two of them, it probably wasn't very appropriate, right? Aren't humans or divine supposed to especially value morals and privacy?</p><p></p><p>How could he just give them a live performance like this? Was he trying to entertain them? Oh well, whatever.</p><p></p><p>Since they're watching anyway, might as well pass the time and learn a bit about their inheritance culture.</p><p></p><p>The Big Fish and Underworld Wolf positioned themselves, staring intently at Ye Xiao and the Narcissus Flower.</p><p></p><p>Of course, Ye Xiao had no idea what they were thinking. He only felt that this Narcissus Flower spirit was quite formidable - judging by her size, she was probably about one and a half times the size of Qin Yuyan! And Qin Yuyan was already very large, Ye Xiao felt like he could barely look at her without feeling the weight, and walking must be so tiring, as if she could drop at any moment.</p><p></p><p>This Narcissus Flower spirit was like two gigantic peaches, each weighing about two jin, growing on a small branch - the branch would definitely be crushed under their weight.</p><p></p><p>Fortunately, Ye Xiao's skills were high, his strikes swift as a knife. From the mountain peak, he sliced down with tremendous force, causing the jade mountain to crumble like cotton candy.</p><p></p><p>With a single move, he had defeated the opponent. The originally unconscious Narcissus Flower suddenly let out a miserable scream, her pupils dilating, gradually transforming back into a Narcissus Flower plant.</p><p></p><p>Big Fish: "(˙灬˙)!"</p><p>Underworld Wolf: "(˙灬˙)!"</p><p></p><p>What the hell? They had gotten all excited for nothing. There was nothing to see, this guy wasn't even trying to do what a man should do.</p><p></p><p>Lunatic, wasting their anticipation.</p><p></p><p>After slaying the Narcissus Flower, her ability to suppress the spiritual energy on her body was lost, and a mighty and pure power burst forth, delighting Ye Xiao.</p><p></p><p>Truly worthy of being a treasure on par with the Eighth Realm of the Divine, her abilities were truly extraordinary.</p><p></p><p>It seems he'll finally be able to eat some vegetables from now on, using her to make some cold dishes or stir-fries - after eating meat, he can give his stomach a break.</p><p></p><p>Perfect.</p><p></p><p>Ye Xiao directly tore off the stems from under the Narcissus Flower, plucking off the black roots one by one, and put them in his mouth to chew. They were extremely tender, juicy, and slightly sweet. As soon as they entered his mouth, he immediately felt refreshed, all of the day's fatigue vanishing without a trace.</p><p></p><p>It seems he'll need to provide more nutrients for this pot of Narcissus Flowers in the future. This precious heavenly treasure shouldn't be wasted.</p><p></p><p>On the Cloud Family's Spiritual Martial Warship, Cloud Shui suddenly opened her eyes, her gaze emanating two icy auras.</p><p></p><p>"What's going on? How could even Lan Xin Water be disconnected? Could it be that she has also been discovered by someone?</p><p></p><p>But that shouldn't be possible! Her level of concealing her aura is first-class, apart from me, no one should have been able to detect her identity. </p><p></p><p>Moreover, the other family's old fellows haven't come here either. Who could it be?"</p><p></p><p>Pausing, he called out towards the door.</p><p></p><p>"Zhen Wu!"</p><p></p><p>Zhen Wu quickly entered.</p><p></p><p>"Elder, I'm here."</p><p></p><p>"Go to my treasure room and bring out the cage in the top right corner!"</p><p></p><p>Zhen Wu's pupils suddenly contracted, his body even involuntarily shuddering.</p><p></p><p>"Elder! You can't be joking with me, right? The being sealed in that cage is on par with the Ninth Realm of the Divine!"</p><p></p><p>"Of course I know that. Since even the Narcissus Flower has met with misfortune, I must dispatch a truly powerful expert."</p><p></p><p>Here is the full English translation of the Chinese excerpt:</p><p></p><p>"Exist, go and find it."</p><p></p><p>Cloud Zhen Wu's body hair stood on end involuntarily.</p><p></p><p>The daffodil is gone too?</p><p></p><p>Wow, this little human world is a bit too terrifying, isn't it?</p><p></p><p>After a pause, he nodded in agreement and quickly brought the cage back.</p><p></p><p>Cloud Shui opened the black cloth covering the cage, and inside was a fierce tiger with only one eye left!</p><p></p><p>The aura it emanated, even though it was behind bars, made Cloud Zhen Wu, a cultivator at the Godly Realm Fifth Layer, tremble involuntarily.</p><p></p><p>This was one of the star beasts Cloud Shui raised, ranking among the top five - a beast lord comparable to the Godly Realm Ninth Layer - the Dragon Blood Tiger.</p><p></p><p>The tiger breed mixed with dragon blood was so powerful that it was terrifying. </p><p></p><p>Its thick blood qi was so fierce that even Slay God Realm existences did not dare to casually drink its fresh blood.</p><p></p><p>It was said that one of its eyeballs was injured when it fought against a young dragon, and even the Nine Star Healing Art could not heal it.</p><p></p><p>Seeing Cloud Shui, the Dragon Blood Tiger didn't even bother to lift its eyelid.</p><p></p><p>Possessing the bloodlines of both the dragon and the tiger, its innate pride was at the extreme, and ordinary people could not possibly fall into its sight.</p><p></p><p>Cloud Shui was not angry, he knew the temperament of every star beast he raised, and he knew that the stronger the star beast, the more temperamental it would be.</p><p></p><p>This was normal.</p><p></p><p>If they didn't have a temper, they wouldn't have come this far.</p><p></p><p>"This Dragon Blood Tiger, although its strength is only at the Godly Realm Ninth Layer, relying on its extremely powerful bloodline power, even if it encounters a Half-Step Slay God expert, it has nothing to fear.</p><p></p><p>Even if it encounters a true Slay God Realm existence, it also has a certain chance of escaping.</p><p></p><p>I don't believe this time it will still go missing! Go, Dragon Blood Tiger, go out and bring that extremely talented young man back to me. You possess the top-tier bloodlines of the dragon and the tiger, you should be able to sense his existence."</p><p></p><p>After saying this, he directly chose to open the cage.</p><p></p><p>"Roar!"</p><p></p><p>The Dragon Blood Tiger let out a thunderous roar, and the next moment, it had turned into a pure golden light and disappeared into the sky.</p><p></p><p>Watching it disappear in that direction, Cloud Zhen Wu sighed, "This time it should be much better. Even the Dragon Blood Tiger has taken action, so there's no way there will be any loopholes, right?"</p><p></p><p>Cloud Shui also smiled slightly.</p><p></p><p>"Of course. That extraordinary talent is destined to be mine."</p><p></p><p>The next morning, Lan Xin Narcissus regained consciousness, and Ye Xiao had healed her with the Immortality Art.</p><p></p><p>When Ye Xiao went to work, she saw the Ghostly Wolf and couldn't help but exclaim, "Ghostly Wolf, how are you here?"</p><p></p><p>"You know me?" </p><p></p><p>The Ghostly Wolf was somewhat puzzled. Lan Xin Narcissus then spoke:</p><p></p><p>"You and I both belong to the same master, but your memories should have been erased, because the master was worried that you wouldn't be able to complete the task, and in case you were discovered by others, they would use soul searching."</p><p></p><p>She then infused a memory into the Ghostly Wolf's mind.</p><p></p><p>The Ghostly Wolf's gaze became scattered for a moment, but soon it was restored.</p><p></p><p>"I knew there was something missing in my mind. It turns out it was this part of the memory.</p><p></p><p>By the way, how did you also get caught here?"</p><p></p><p>Lan Xin Narcissus bitterly smiled.</p><p></p><p>"Don't mention it, I was just walking on the street when suddenly I felt my head being hit hard from behind.</p><p></p><p>The attack was so powerful that my soul was even severely injured, so I directly passed out.</p><p></p><p>When I woke up again, I was already here."</p><p></p><p>The Ghostly Wolf clenched its claws.</p><p></p><p>"We really underestimated this young man, didn't expect his strength to be so powerful, so we ended up getting caught.</p><p></p><p>Now we've become his prisoners, really disappointing our master's cultivation."</p><p></p><p>Lan Xin Narcissus comforted, "You don't need to be too self-blaming. Our strength is too weak, so being unable to defeat him is normal.</p><p></p><p>But don't worry, the master definitely won't abandon us.</p><p></p><p>He still has many star beasts that are even stronger than us.</p><p></p><p>When the master sees that we haven't returned, he will definitely send them to find us.</p><p></p><p>At that time, getting out of here will be as easy as pie."</p><p></p><p>Hearing this, the Ghostly Wolf nodded.</p><p></p><p>"That's right. Apart from the Dragon Blood Tiger big brother, this young man is far from being able to contend with.</p><p></p><p>Not to mention, the Dragon Blood Tiger is only the fifth strongest star beast the master has raised.</p><p></p><p>In front of it, there are even more powerful star beasts, this human world can't possibly keep us all imprisoned here forever."</p><p></p><p>The nearby big fish, after hearing this, immediately came over, rubbing its fins in a fawning manner.</p><p></p><p>"Big brother, big sister. Is what you just said true?"</p><p></p><p>The two star beasts looked at it with guarded expressions.</p><p></p><p>"What do you want?"</p><p></p><p>"Hehe, don't misunderstand, I just want to ask, when someone comes to rescue you two, can you take me along too?"</p>

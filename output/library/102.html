        <h1>Chapter 102</h1>
        <div class="content">
            <p>Here is the full English translation of the Chinese excerpt:</p><p></p><p>Because Ye Xiao often read the "Star Beast Chronicles", he was able to identify at a glance that this scale belonged to a star beast black scale snake of the tiger-level bloodline.</p><p></p><p>The bloodline hierarchy of star beasts is divided into three levels: dragon, tiger, and wolf. The dragon level is the highest, while the wolf level is the weakest.</p><p></p><p>The power levels are also divided into ordinary, extraordinary, and master levels, with the rest being on par with humans.</p><p></p><p>The tiger-level bloodline is already considered a very good bloodline, and the other party has cultivated to the extraordinary level, so it can be considered to train it a bit further and raise its power to the master level. At that time, it can be flayed, its tendons extracted, its flesh and core refined into elixirs, and its skin and scales forged into armor.</p><p></p><p>On the one hand, this is much more economical than directly buying it. But the main reason is not this - Ye Xiao is not very concerned about money. The main reason is that the "Demonic Forging Arts" records that when forging armor or weapons, it is best to use the complete skin and bones of a star beast, as it is easier to achieve compatibility and success, and the resulting quality will be better, with rare occurrences of a drop in grade or failed forging due to genetic incompatibility.</p><p></p><p>Tonight, there is no time for that, but tomorrow is Saturday, a rest day, so he can go then.</p><p></p><p>Ye Xiao first went back to refine this half-scale into a flying dagger.</p><p></p><p>Very quickly, he forged a flying dagger.</p><p></p><p>Compared to the previous flying dagger forged from wrought iron, it has already reached the same grade - both are master-level flying daggers.</p><p></p><p>This is the special property of the materials. Forging a small flying dagger from wrought iron requires over a thousand catties, but a master-level flying dagger can be directly forged from the scale of an extraordinary-level black scale snake.</p><p></p><p>This is the gap between the two.</p><p></p><p>Of course, this is also because Ye Xiao has cultivated the "Demonic Forging Arts", allowing him to easily forge a master-level flying dagger. If it were other forgers, being able to forge an extraordinary-level one would already be very good.</p><p></p><p>Ye Xiao's overall cultivation level is far beyond that of others. Just like when he was at the master level, he could already split a river with a single sword strike, but for ordinary masters like Qin Shenglong, being able to unleash a 200-meter sword beam is already their limit, let alone splitting the river.</p><p></p><p>This is also why Ye Xiao dares to think of slaying the Aer King - he can transcend his level, like a junior defeating a senior.</p><p></p><p>The next morning, Ye Xiao had some crab roe steamed buns and a bowl of spicy hot soup to satisfy his appetite, then came to the materials store.</p><p></p><p>Selling just a small flying dagger wouldn't risk exposing himself. He can sell more precious items at the black market, where he can change his appearance each time to avoid exposure.</p><p></p><p>"Old Master Xu."</p><p>"Ah, Xiao Ye is here. Are you here to buy materials or...?"</p><p>"To sell something."</p><p>"Oh? What good thing do you have to sell this time?"</p><p>"Remember the flying dagger I sold you last time? When I got back, I realized it's actually a pair."</p><p>"Oh? Such good fortune!" </p><p>Old Master Xu's eyes lit up. Ye Xiao nodded and handed over the flying daggers.</p><p>Old Master Xu took a quick look and couldn't help but exclaim, "Good stuff, Ye Xiao. Your ancestral forging skills are truly impressive. No wonder your forging level is so high."</p><p></p><p>As an experienced purchaser, Old Master Xu didn't even need to test them. A single glance allowed him to discern the grade of the flying daggers and the similarity in forging mastery between the two.</p><p></p><p>In the art of forging, each person's methods differ. For beginners, the gap can be quite large.</p><p></p><p>Here is the full English translation of the Chinese excerpt:</p><p></p><p>Though not very large yet, as the refining skills improve, the differences between them will become more apparent.</p><p></p><p>The weapons forged by the weapon refiners will have distinct characteristics, which depend on the refiners' habits, temperament, and so on.</p><p></p><p>It's as if they've infused a part of themselves into it.</p><p></p><p>As for distinguishing the grades, that's even simpler. The hardness between the ordinary and the extraordinary can be seen at a glance, and a slight release of spiritual energy can be used to test it.</p><p></p><p>The master-level weapons and armor have already reached the ability to absorb spiritual energy on their own.</p><p></p><p>This is the precious part of the master-level weapons and armor. </p><p></p><p>Their ability to absorb spiritual energy means they have a self-repair function in terms of craftsmanship.</p><p></p><p>As long as the damage is not too severe, they can self-repair.</p><p></p><p>Of course, if the user releases spiritual energy and inputs it into them, it can also accelerate their repair.</p><p></p><p>"Can I get the money now?" </p><p></p><p>After Mr. Xu finished inspecting, Ye Xiao spoke up calmly.</p><p></p><p>"Yes, yes, I'll transfer the money to you right away." </p><p></p><p>Mr. Xu smiled and transferred the money, still at the old price of 120,000.</p><p></p><p>With this, Ye Xiao's assets had exceeded 300,000.</p><p></p><p>"Little Ye, I have something I want to talk to you about."</p><p></p><p>Ye Xiao waved his hand.</p><p></p><p>"No need. I still stand by what I said, I'm not interested in refining weapons."</p><p></p><p>"It's not about that today."</p><p></p><p>"Then what is it?"</p><p></p><p>"Little Ye, I remember you don't have a girlfriend, right? I want to introduce my daughter to you."</p><p></p><p>Ye Xiao was silent for a moment.</p><p></p><p>"Mr. Xu, I'm not ready to find a girlfriend yet, I hope you can understand."</p><p></p><p>"Little Ye, I'm being sincere. I know my daughter may not be up to your standards in terms of appearance, but she's my only daughter. In the future, all of our family's money will definitely be passed down to her.</p><p></p><p>Don't look at me just running a materials store, in Jianghai City, I have over 50 storefronts alone, worth over 100 million.</p><p></p><p>I also have over 50 million in the bank, and I have a big villa in the old city area waiting to be demolished.</p><p></p><p>If you two get married now, the demolition can give you an extra person's fee, and you can get an extra apartment.</p><p></p><p>Don't worry, even though you're coming in, I absolutely won't let you be bullied. This family will be yours to command in the future."</p><p></p><p>Ye Xiao: "..."</p><p></p><p>"How about it? Consider it?"</p><p></p><p>Before Ye Xiao could refuse, Mr. Xu continued:</p><p></p><p>"My daughter, her looks are still okay, not exactly a stunning beauty, but definitely a little jewel. Living with her won't be a loss for you."</p><p></p><p>As soon as he finished speaking, a rugged figure came down the stairs, carrying two large iron packages.</p><p></p><p>"Dad, I've brought down those 10 tons of pig iron from upstairs for you."</p><p></p><p>"Put the things down first, let me introduce you to someone."</p><p></p><p>"Okay!"</p><p></p><p>The person threw the two iron packages on the ground, and if the floor wasn't made of precision steel, it would have shattered.</p><p></p><p>Then, he patted his hands and strode over to Ye Xiao.</p><p></p><p>"Ye Xiao, this is my daughter, Xu Dacao."</p><p></p><p>Ye Xiao looked up and saw this nearly 2-meter-tall woman, and his brain felt a bit overwhelmed.</p><p></p><p>A little jewel indeed! Five little jewels!</p><p></p><p>[End of the chapter]</p>

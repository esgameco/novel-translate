        <h1>Chapter 293</h1>
        <div class="content">
            <p>Here is the full English translation of the Chinese excerpt:</p><p></p><p>"That's right, the Crane Immortal Maiden is a half-step Spiritual Beast expert, and it's most appropriate for her to take action."</p><p></p><p>"The mischievous fox from the Silver Fox Valley is also a half-step Spiritual Beast in strength. Facing the innate ninth-grade cultivation of Sister Brocade Jade Rabbit, the Silver Fox Valley might still have a few tricks up their sleeve, but against the Crane Immortal Maiden, they have absolutely no chance of winning."</p><p></p><p>"Crane Immortal Maiden, this time, it all depends on you!"</p><p></p><p>The Crane Immortal Maiden solemnly nodded her head, and her elegant and cold face was filled with confidence.</p><p></p><p>"Silver Fox Valley, you want to monopolize the treasure, but that's impossible!"</p><p></p><p>Time quickly passed, and it was now night. Ye Xiao was lying on the bed, staring blankly at the ceiling.</p><p></p><p>The rabbit meat had been completely eaten, leaving only the bones, star pearls, and the soul, which he had stored in his storage ring.</p><p></p><p>This way, when he returned to the surface, he could revive her and then place her in the breeding farm to continue shearing her wool.</p><p></p><p>Humans must take the path of sustainable development. Only the path of sustainable development can ensure success.</p><p></p><p>Unfortunately, Brocade Jade Rabbit's star core did not contain any suitable cultivation methods, only a movement technique, and Ye Xiao currently did not need the movement technique, so it was completely useless.</p><p></p><p>He didn't know when the Heavenly Emperor's inheritance would be unlocked. Although there were only a few days left, it was still somewhat boring here.</p><p></p><p>While feeling bored, Ye Xiao's eyes suddenly narrowed.</p><p></p><p>Someone had arrived.</p><p></p><p>Accompanied by a slight creaking sound from the window, moonlight poured in, and with the moonlight came a long, slender leg!</p><p></p><p>It was very long, at least 1.2 meters.</p><p></p><p>It was also very white, reflecting the moonlight outside and emitting a faint glow.</p><p></p><p>Ye Xiao's gaze couldn't help but flicker.</p><p></p><p>So long!</p><p></p><p>A gentle breeze blew in, carrying a faint, lingering fragrance that entered Ye Xiao's nostrils.</p><p></p><p>So fragrant!</p><p></p><p>This scent, without even needing to add any seasoning oil, or even any spices, just slow-braising the meat until it's tender, then sprinkling a little black pepper and cilantro, and squeezing out a few drops of lemon juice to add a refreshing taste and reduce the oiliness, would absolutely make a delicious soup.</p><p></p><p>The window was fully opened, and the graceful figure and cold, beautiful face of the Crane Immortal Maiden were revealed to Ye Xiao's eyes.</p><p></p><p>She glanced at the burning desire in Ye Xiao's eyes and a trace of disdain and contempt flashed across her expression.</p><p></p><p>Of course, men are all useless. Normally, with her temperament, she wouldn't even glance at a man like Ye Xiao.</p><p></p><p>But at this moment, she had no choice. In order to find the answers, she had to sacrifice her pride.</p><p></p><p>Thinking about this, she forced herself to squeeze out a faint smile, easily stepping the other leg into the room and slowly approaching Ye Xiao.</p><p></p><p>"Little human brother, all alone here, feeling lonely? Shall sister keep you company and play with you?"</p><p></p><p>As soon as she finished speaking, her eyes were suddenly enveloped by a dazzling light.</p><p></p><p>The blinding light made her involuntarily squint her eyes, and then she inexplicably felt a sharp pain in her neck, and her head heavily crashed to the ground.</p><p></p><p>Crane Immortal Maiden: "?"</p><p></p><p>A deep sense of bewilderment enveloped her heart until she saw a headless crane body lying next to her, and she finally understood - she had been killed! She had actually been killed? And so quickly?</p><p></p><p>This had to be a joke, right? She was a half-step Spiritual Beast, comparable to a half-step Monarch realm expert in the human realm. Yet she had been so easily and swiftly killed? And she hadn't even seen her opponent's attack coming!</p><p></p><p>How could the speed be so fast? No, wait a minute, she suddenly realized something.</p><p></p><p>Why was there a human in the Silver Fox Valley? Even though the relationship between the Silver Fox Clan and humans was relatively good, it was still unlikely for a human to appear there so casually.</p><p></p><p>Apart from that, there was another very important thing.</p><p></p><p>That is, the vixen of the Fox Queen, seemed to have great respect for this human.</p><p></p><p>If it was just some pretty boy she was keeping, no matter what, she wouldn't have such deep respect.</p><p></p><p>That means this human must be extremely powerful, powerful enough to command her deep respect, even though she was a half-step Spiritual Beast, comparable to a half-step Monarch realm expert.</p><p></p><p>If even she had such great respect for him, how strong must he be? Monarch realm? Or even beyond Monarch realm?</p><p></p><p>In that instant, the Crane Immortal Maiden felt incredibly stupid, no, they were all stupid!</p><p></p><p>If her guess was correct, Brocade Jade Rabbit had most likely also suffered a tragic end.</p><p></p><p>This man was terrifyingly powerful, and even more terrifying was that he didn't seem to like women at all, treating them as prey!</p><p></p><p>Why did she have to provoke such a monstrous existence? If she hadn't provoked him, she could have at least lived well.</p><p></p><p>Unfortunately, there are no "ifs" in this world.</p><p></p><p>She could no longer continue thinking, as her consciousness gradually sank into the darkness and disappeared without a trace.</p><p></p><p>In contrast to her shock and sorrow, Ye Xiao was feeling quite excited.</p><p></p><p>"Strange, my luck seems to have been pretty good lately. Whatever I think of seems to just come to me."</p><p></p><p>Here is the full English translation of the Chinese excerpt:</p><p></p><p>"What's this? Is it my illusion?"</p><p></p><p>Never mind, it's just those star beasts, they came to me on their own, they have nothing to do with me.</p><p></p><p>Let me braise her first, the crane meat is a bit tough, not easy to stew soft, it must be braised over high heat for a long time to bring out the aroma. Besides that, what makes Ye Xiao a bit happier is that from the star core of the Crane Immortal Lady, he obtained a brand new cultivation technique.</p><p></p><p>The Imperial Art Leg Technique - Heavenly Splitting Strike! A very powerful leg technique, comparable to the Martial God Powerful Kick.</p><p></p><p>But the Martial God Powerful Kick is a charging-type attack, and the more it is charged, the more powerful it becomes.</p><p></p><p>The Heavenly Splitting Strike, on the other hand, is a one-time attack, delivering the strike to the target in an instant.</p><p></p><p>It's not that its power is weaker than the Martial God Powerful Kick, the main difference is that it is an instantaneous technique, and it requires very high physical strength to execute.</p><p></p><p>Fortunately, Ye Xiao has the Indestructible Divine Skill to cultivate his body, combining it with his body cultivation, the execution of this leg technique will be absolutely shocking.</p><p></p><p>The time in the starry sky seems to pass quickly, or perhaps Ye Xiao has experienced too many things without a break, so he feels the time is passing quickly.</p><p></p><p>Unconsciously, it's the next day.</p><p></p><p>This time, to Ye Xiao's surprise, those star beasts did not come out to harass him.</p><p></p><p>In stark contrast to when Bingluoyu Rabbit disappeared yesterday.</p><p></p><p>As for why, Ye Xiao didn't know their tricks, but he didn't bother to care too much.</p><p></p><p>As long as they don't come to bother him, that's a good thing.</p><p></p><p>Of course, compared to this, Ye Xiao would rather they come to bother him.</p><p></p><p>That way, he can increase his dishes.</p><p></p><p>In the neighboring VIP pavilion, several star beasts gathered together with grave expressions, the atmosphere extremely solemn.</p><p></p><p>"The Crane Immortal Lady hasn't come back either."</p><p></p><p>If it was only the Primordial Ninth-Grade Bingluoyu Rabbit who didn't come back, they could still understand to some extent.</p><p></p><p>Because Bingluoyu Rabbit was only at the Primordial Ninth-Grade level, but the Crane Immortal Lady was a powerhouse at the Half-Step Divine Beast level.</p><p></p><p>"Now it seems, this place must have something strange."</p><p></p><p>"Have you heard of a legend? Long, long ago, the ancestors of the Silver Fox Clan, relying on their ability to transform, would often lure other races of star beasts and human tribes to this place, and then swallow them whole, leaving not even a bone fragment!"</p><p></p><p>The other star beasts couldn't help but shudder.</p><p></p><p>"Fuck, don't tell such a scary joke. It's really frightening, you know?"</p><p></p><p>"This is not a joke, I've also heard of this legend. And the biggest problem now is that Bingluoyu Rabbit and the Crane Immortal Lady, just as they were separated, disappeared without a trace. If there's nothing ghostly about the Silver Fox Valley, I absolutely don't believe it."</p><p></p><p>"These damn fox spirits, they look like they only know how to get horny, but who would have thought their methods are so ruthless."</p><p></p><p>"Maybe they have already set their sights on us."</p><p></p><p>"Let's get out of here quickly! I feel goosebumps all over my body the longer I stay here."</p><p></p><p>At this moment, the voice of the Fox Empress suddenly sounded from outside.</p><p></p><p>"My sisters, are you all up?"</p><p></p><p>The hearts of the group sank.</p><p></p><p>"Damn, she's here!"</p><p></p><p>"Now we have one Half-Step Divine Beast here, and the other two are Primordial Ninth-Grade, if she wants to do something crooked, we have no way to resist."</p><p></p><p>"Maybe she's already come to take us, because she has already eliminated the Crane Immortal Lady, she knows our strength is no longer enough to resist the Silver Fox Valley."</p><p></p><p>"Can't meet her, let's flee!"</p><p></p><p>The star beasts exchanged glances, confirmed their thoughts, and instantly turned into silver lights, disappearing from the spot.</p><p></p><p>Their speed was so fast that they even directly smashed through the VIP pavilion, not even leaving a chance for the Fox Empress to speak.</p><p></p><p>Fox Empress: "（⊙.⊙）!"</p><p></p><p>She was immediately dumbfounded.</p><p></p><p>What's going on? Why did they want to run as soon as they heard my voice? And they ran so fast?</p><p></p><p>It's not like I'm a monster! Am I really that scary?</p><p></p><p>No, wait a minute, could it be that they've discovered the secret of the Silver Fox Valley?</p><p></p><p>Otherwise, why would they be so guilty and flee as soon as they saw me?</p><p></p><p>They must have sensed something in the Silver Fox Valley last night. Damn it, I never thought there would be a loophole despite all my precautions.</p><p></p><p>But which part went wrong? I had everything arranged perfectly! Anyway, this is not the time to think about that.</p><p></p><p>Even if they didn't know before, now that they know, I should hurry up and find a way to make up for it.</p><p></p><p>Thinking about this problem, the Fox Empress' expression immediately changed, becoming extremely grave.</p><p></p><p>"Damn it! Quickly, summon the Holy Son. Also, go notify Mr. Ye, just say I have an important matter to discuss with him!"</p>

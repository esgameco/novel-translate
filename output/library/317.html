        <h1>Chapter 317</h1>
        <div class="content">
            <p>Here is the full English translation of the Chinese excerpt:</p><p></p><p>The thunderous roars echoed from the gigantic hurricane channel in the sky above. Flashes of lightning and rumbles of thunder reverberated, caused by the rapid rotation of the clouds, resulting in frictional discharge.</p><p></p><p>Reaching the realm of the Supernal Divine, if one were to emerge, the world would be transformed. Even without taking action, the sheer power radiating from one's being would be akin to a towering mountain, capable of stirring the spiritual energies of heaven and earth, causing them to tremble.</p><p></p><p>Ye Xiao stood with his hands clasped behind his back, gazing up at the sky. Since attaining the Emperor Realm, he had never engaged in combat with those of the realms above. If not for the sudden outbreak of the Beast Calamity, he might have sparred with the Sword Emperor, Azure Dragon.</p><p></p><p>Alas, with the arrival of the Beast Calamity, he could not practice beforehand and had to forgo the opportunity. During the battles in Jianghai City and here, he had not encountered any existence above the Emperor Realm. The mightiest star beasts he had faced were at most Half-Step Supernal Divine, their strength merely comparable to the Half-Step Emperor Realm of the human race, completely unable to compel him to unleash his full power. Such childishly simple battles held no challenge for him; he desired more thrilling confrontations to further test the limits of his own strength, to reach the true Supernal Divine Realm.</p><p></p><p>Accompanied by flashes of lightning and rumbles of thunder, a massive Sovereign Dragon-Lion descended from the hurricane. Its entire body emanated a faint golden glow, for its spiritual energy had reached the pinnacle, becoming so dense that it manifested as an aura.</p><p></p><p>The Sovereign Dragon-Lion stepped out from the hurricane, its towering figure exceeding eight meters in length, like a small mountain. As it fully emerged, the hurricane gradually dissipated, for the transfer portal was no longer affected by its presence. In that moment, it shone as brilliantly as the sun high in the heavens.</p><p></p><p>Gazing at Ye Xiao, its eyes gleamed with the intensity of swords, exuding a chill and battle intent.</p><p></p><p>"In centuries, who would have thought the human race would produce another Emperor Realm expert! Truly an eye-opening sight."</p><p></p><p>Ye Xiao remained silent, and the Sovereign Dragon-Lion continued, "If you had broken through to the Emperor Realm sooner, perhaps you could have been of some help to the human race. Alas, your breakthrough now comes too late; you cannot keep up with the times. The human race is doomed, and nothing can stop it."</p><p></p><p>Ye Xiao finally spoke his first words, "As long as I live, the human race will not perish!"</p><p></p><p>These simple words were imbued with Ye Xiao's hope and confidence in the people of the Nine Provinces. The Sovereign Dragon-Lion's gaze remained indifferent, unmoved by such "human sentiments." The star beasts revered only the strong and the victorious, the harsh realities of the world.</p><p></p><p>With a slight shift in its eyes, the Sovereign Dragon-Lion began to move, its speed appearing languid, yet Ye Xiao knew better than to underestimate it. In the blink of an eye, the Sovereign Dragon-Lion had already expanded its domain, and seven powerful forces struck at Ye Xiao from different directions.</p><p></p><p>Fortunately, Ye Xiao's speed was not inferior, and he swiftly evoked the Yin-Yang Escape Art, easily evading the attack. The spot where he had stood moments ago erupted in a terrifying implosive explosion, a unique technique of the Sovereign Dragon-Lion. Had the attack landed, it would have inflicted severe damage. But for Ye Xiao, this pose no significant threat.</p><p></p><p>The Sovereign Dragon-Lion glanced at Ye Xiao and once more unleashed its might from its breath.</p><p></p><p>Here is the full English translation of the Chinese excerpt:</p><p></p><p>A light hum.</p><p></p><p>"Hmph!"</p><p></p><p>He seemed to have an extremely low opinion of Ye Xiao. "Flamboyant!"</p><p></p><p>However, despite the cursing, Ye Xiao could clearly feel that he was about to get serious.</p><p></p><p>This was exactly what Ye Xiao wanted.</p><p></p><p>What he wanted was to make the Sovereign Dragon Lion get serious, otherwise, how could he satisfy his desire to test his current cultivation? Especially to test his defensive power.</p><p></p><p>In the next instant, the Sovereign Dragon Lion appeared behind him.</p><p></p><p>This speed was many times stronger than just now.</p><p></p><p>In the Emperor Realm, the Martial Emperors could indeed be said to be omnipotent.</p><p></p><p>Although it couldn't be said to be completely so, it was merely approaching it, but it was still infinitely close.</p><p></p><p>The Sovereign Dragon Lion suddenly accelerated, appearing behind Ye Xiao.</p><p></p><p>This terrifying speed was almost two dimensions faster than his previous attack speed!</p><p></p><p>Taking advantage of Ye Xiao's unpreparedness, a sharp claw suddenly burst forth.</p><p></p><p>The huge claw wind, emanating with faint deadly cold aura, was directly imprinted on Ye Xiao's back.</p><p></p><p>Boom! Accompanied by a violent explosion, Ye Xiao's body was blasted away like a ball.</p><p></p><p>But this was far from the end, he had just begun.</p><p></p><p>The next moment, the Sovereign Dragon Lion appeared beside Ye Xiao again, the second strike, the third strike, the fourth strike, the fifth strike, Ye Xiao seemed to have no way to resist at all, allowing the Sovereign Dragon Lion to attack him.</p><p></p><p>The Sovereign Dragon Lion became more and more comfortable with the attacks, more and more excited, and also more and more proud! Have you human cultivators felt fear? Although you have stepped into the legendary Emperor Realm, but you who have just stepped into the Emperor Realm are still just a small piece of trash, you don't even have the qualifications to fight against me.</p><p></p><p>Ranked 21st on the Star Ranking, the Sovereign Dragon Lion!</p><p></p><p>He had once challenged four Monarch Realm experts in the Divine Beast Realm at the same time, and slaughtered two of them, severely injured one, and crippled one! Later, under the Seven Star Convergence, he smoothly broke through to the Emperor Realm! He is an existence that can easily crush enemies of the same level.</p><p></p><p>Among his peers, his endurance and killing power are unparalleled!</p><p></p><p>Even when facing old-school Emperors, he is not inferior.</p><p></p><p>And the current Ye Xiao, in his eyes, is nothing more than a piece of trash, a plaything, a doomed prey!</p><p></p><p>Human Emperor Realm, haha, is nothing more than this!</p><p></p><p>Forget it, I'm not interested anymore, I'll send you on your way!</p><p></p><p>The Sovereign Dragon Lion glanced at Ye Xiao, and the power in his body completely erupted to the extreme.</p><p></p><p>"Roar!"</p><p></p><p>Accompanied by a thunderous roar, the Sovereign Dragon Lion's power was raised to the extreme at this moment.</p><p></p><p>His huge body, like a small mountain, stood up, crossed his arms, and poured all his strength into his claws.</p><p></p><p>"Rend the Stars!"</p><p></p><p>The Sovereign Dragon Lion's innate supreme technique.</p><p></p><p>The peerless claw technique!</p><p></p><p>The number of human experts who had died from this move was unknown.</p><p></p><p>But the Sovereign Dragon Lion had never been as excited as he was today.</p><p></p><p>Because the one he was going to kill today was a human Emperor Realm expert! Rend the Stars, with the might to destroy heaven and earth, gathered the supreme power of the clouds and thunders, and pressed down on Ye Xiao.</p><p></p><p>Behind the Sovereign Dragon Lion, the clouds seemed to form a huge lion head, roaring in victory. Inside the lion head, in the clouds, there were flashes of lightning everywhere.</p><p></p><p>However, just as he was about to strike, Ye Xiao calmly spoke:</p><p></p><p>"The Great Perfection Divine Body, the defensive power is indeed impressive. Next, it's time to test the offensive power."</p><p></p><p>The Sovereign Dragon Lion's brow twitched, he still didn't quite understand Ye Xiao's meaning.</p><p></p><p>But it didn't matter, Rend the Stars would fall, and even if Ye Xiao didn't die, he would be severely injured. By then, everything would be over.</p><p></p><p>However, just as he was about to strike, an unexpected event suddenly occurred.</p><p></p><p>Two beams of light flashed from his eyes, diverging to both sides.</p><p></p><p>The Sovereign Dragon Lion's arms suddenly detached from his body in an instant! Puff! Blood sprayed wildly, a sharp pain came, and the Sovereign Dragon Lion's already huge eyes widened even more, looking at this with disbelief on his face.</p><p></p><p>His arms were cut off! The two beams of light flashed, and his arms were cut off.</p><p></p><p>He didn't even see clearly whether those two beams of light were sword light, blade light, or something else! What's going on? What happened? Who can tell him?</p><p></p><p>"The Heavenly Sword Technique, effective against super divine beasts comparable to the Emperor Realm, is also quite good."</p><p></p><p>Ye Xiao nodded, and the trace of approval in his eyes made the Sovereign Dragon Lion instantly collapse.</p><p></p><p>This guy! Was he just testing his techniques?</p><p></p><p>What a joke? Then that sentence he said about defense, was that also just a test?</p><p></p><p>From the beginning to now, he never treated this as a real battle, while he had been exerting his full strength, Ye Xiao was only experimenting, only treating it as a game?</p>

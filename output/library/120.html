        <h1>Chapter 120</h1>
        <div class="content">
            <p>Here is the full English translation of the Chinese excerpt:</p><p></p><p>Over fifty years!</p><p></p><p>Every day, she was afraid of exposing her identity, so she could only hide tremblingly in other people's houses, pretending to be a ghost to ensure that she would not be discovered.</p><p></p><p>She had no money, and had to steal for food and clothing.</p><p></p><p>During the most difficult times, a pair of stockings would last her several months, with holes worn through the toes!</p><p></p><p>Although she had the bloodline of a dragon-level star beast, and her future could be considered that of a great emperor!</p><p></p><p>But when she came to Jianghai City, she was still just a young cub!</p><p></p><p>At that time, her strength was only at the post-natal level.</p><p></p><p>In order to survive, it can be said that she had exhausted all her strength! She had just managed to cultivate into a sect master-level expert, but then she encountered this abnormal Ye Xiao, who directly took her as a star pet, which was truly pitiful.</p><p></p><p>And she didn't know how many more days and nights she would continue to be tormented.</p><p></p><p>But now, she has finally waited for her fellow star beasts to come and take her back, this feeling is no less than being released from prison after decades!</p><p></p><p>No one could understand the excitement in Xuanliu Li's heart at this moment.</p><p></p><p>The two half-beasts looked at each other, their brows slightly raised, and communicated through their thoughts: "Why does she call herself our family?"</p><p></p><p>"I don't know, I heard that star beasts with powerful bloodlines often have some inherited quirks because their bloodlines are too pure. And maybe she was a female cat before, but was castrated."</p><p></p><p>"That makes sense."</p><p></p><p>The two exchanged a few more words, then spoke out:</p><p></p><p>"Since that's the case, then please, Great Lady Xuanying Cat, come back with us."</p><p></p><p>Xuanliu Li was stunned for a moment, then immediately shook her head.</p><p></p><p>"Go back now? No, no, no!"</p><p></p><p>Joking aside, of course she wanted to go back, but the problem was, if she went back now, wouldn't Ye Xiao just skin her alive? Even if she wanted to go back, she would have to wait until the day of the Seven Stars Convergence, when all the star beasts would be strengthened and the emergence of powerful experts, when Ye Xiao would be preoccupied with his own matters, before she could leave. The two half-beast experts' gazes suddenly turned a bit cold.</p><p></p><p>"What? Does the Great Lady Xuanying Cat not want to go back?"</p><p></p><p>Xuanliu Li's face flushed a bit, of course she didn't dare to say that she was afraid of Ye Xiao, if this got out, wouldn't that be embarrassing to the point of no return? She would never be able to hold her head up again in this lifetime.</p><p></p><p>So, she cleared her throat lightly, with a serious expression:</p><p></p><p>"Actually, our family still has some matters to take care of. </p><p></p><p>Our family is now imitating the ancient human experts, King Fuchai of Wu, in 'lying on the firewood and tasting the bitterness'.</p><p></p><p>As long as the opportunity arises, our family will definitely return to the star beast clan."</p><p></p><p>As soon as these words were spoken, one of the half-beasts directly punched out, hitting Xuanliu Li.</p><p></p><p>Boom! The powerful force directly blew Xuanliu Li away, sending her crashing into the mountain forest behind the hospital.</p><p></p><p>The other half-beast: "(⊙.⊙)!"</p><p></p><p>"Why did you hit her?"</p><p></p><p>"She has already betrayed us."</p><p></p><p>"What makes you say that?"</p><p></p><p>"I've felt something off about her from the beginning, and sure enough, she exposed herself. </p><p></p><p>She thought a simple excuse could fool me, but unfortunately, while she may have fooled you, she can't fool me.</p><p></p><p>I'm a man of culture, I've read the Spring and Autumn Annals, and it was King Goujian of Yue who 'lay on the firewood and tasted the bitterness', not King Fuchai of Wu!"</p><p></p><p>Upon hearing this, the other half-beast's pupils suddenly shrank, and his gaze turned completely icy cold.</p><p></p><p>"This traitor! Kill her!"</p><p></p><p>With that, the two of them stepped down, turning into streaks of light and rushing into the mountain forest.</p><p></p><p>At this moment, even though Xuanliu Li had the bloodline of a dragon-level star beast and an unlimited future, she still had to be killed!</p><p></p><p>Xuanliu Li was completely dumbfounded.</p><p></p><p>Lying on the firewood and tasting the bitterness was King Goujian of Yue, not King Fuchai of Wu? </p><p></p><p>King Goujian of Yue had defeated King Fuchai of Wu, so why would he still need to lie on the firewood and taste the bitterness?</p><p></p><p>No, the problem at hand was not this, but to survive first.</p><p></p><p>"Stop..."</p><p></p><p>Here is the full English translation of the Chinese excerpt:</p><p></p><p>"My hand! I am of the dragon bloodline, with the bearing of a supreme emperor. You are merely lowly half-beasts, how dare you defy me? Do you not fear being slaughtered by my star beast clan?"</p><p></p><p>"But you have to survive first."</p><p></p><p>As they spoke, the two had already approached.</p><p></p><p>Huan Liuli had no choice but to fight.</p><p></p><p>She let out a low roar, her sharp cat claws slashing through the air, unleashing eight wind blades that charged towards the two.</p><p></p><p>But to her surprise, the two were not weaker than her at all, both being innate second-grade.</p><p></p><p>The two attacked simultaneously, colliding head-on with her wind blades.</p><p></p><p>Boom! In an instant, a violent explosion rang out in the small mountain.</p><p></p><p>The two opponents then charged straight through the smoke, coming before Huan Liuli.</p><p></p><p>Bang! They attacked again, and Huan Liuli was overpowered, being blasted back once more.</p><p></p><p>Puchi! She spat out a mouthful of fresh blood in midair, feeling the two approaching again, and the cat was utterly desperate.</p><p></p><p>In this moment, her dragon bloodline and the bearing of a supreme emperor had become a joke.</p><p></p><p>She just wanted to live.</p><p></p><p>"Master, save me!"</p><p></p><p>Her cry was filled with heart-wrenching anguish and deep humiliation.</p><p></p><p>The two half-beasts sneered coldly. </p><p></p><p>"Even if Jesus came today, he couldn't save you! You're dead!"</p><p></p><p>But just as the words left their mouths, a flash of light suddenly slashed across their necks.</p><p></p><p>In an instant, the two saw their own bodies running forward without heads.</p><p></p><p>Before they could comprehend what had happened, a tremendous force covered their heads.</p><p></p><p>Boom! The next moment, their heads were blasted into dust, and their consciousness sank into darkness.</p><p></p><p>Only at the moment of their death did they finally understand - Huan Liuli did not want to leave, but could not leave.</p><p></p><p>For she had a super-powerful human expert by her side! But why didn't you say so earlier? Why didn't you directly say you had a powerful human expert with you? Thud thud. Their headless bodies stumbled a few steps forward before crashing to the ground without control.</p><p></p><p>Huan Liuli heaved a deep sigh of relief, a smile of surviving a calamity appearing on her face.</p><p></p><p>"Fortunately, I almost died there. Thank you, Master."</p><p></p><p>Ye Xiao's face was ice-cold as he stared fixedly at Huan Liuli, saying indifferently:</p><p></p><p>"Don't you think you owe me an explanation?"</p><p></p><p>Suddenly being attacked by two innate second-grade half-beasts was completely illogical. </p><p>This silly cat Huan Liuli must be hiding something from him.</p><p></p><p>Huan Liuli's face twitched, and she immediately stood up straight, saying earnestly:</p><p></p><p>"Master, I swear on the heavens that I don't know those two at all."</p><p></p><p>"Do you think I'll believe you?"</p><p></p><p>With that, Ye Xiao directly activated the Taixuan Tiangong, searching Huan Liuli's memories.</p><p></p><p>Huan Liuli's body trembled, thinking to herself, "I'm dead now."</p><p></p><p>But at that moment, the sound of the patrol team's whistle came from afar. Ye Xiao's brow lifted, and he directly grabbed the back of Huan Liuli's neck, using his storage ring to collect the two half-beast bodies, then left the place.</p><p></p><p>This is the second update, please support the new book.</p><p></p><p>I'll explain a little. Some readers said the pacing was slow and I haven't left the new player village yet.</p><p></p><p>Actually, it's like this - in the sign-in text you read, the characters' identities were exposed in just dozens of chapters, but they still need to continue cultivating and reach new realms and maps. The difference is that instead of hiding their identities, they've now exposed them and are changing maps.</p><p></p><p>My protagonist's level-up and progression is the same as theirs, he just hasn't gone out or revealed his identity yet. After all, the book title is "Surviving"!</p><p></p><p>The pacing is actually the same, it's just a different writing style, and I don't want to write the same as everyone else. Thank you.</p><p></p><p>(This chapter ends)</p>

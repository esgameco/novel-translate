        <h1>Chapter 256</h1>
        <div class="content">
            <p>Here is the full English translation of the Chinese excerpt:</p><p></p><p>A roar erupted as Feng Long once again unleashed his power.</p><p></p><p>After experiencing over ten failures in a row, Feng Long's body was covered in wounds.</p><p></p><p>Bruises and swelling were everywhere, and in some places, his dragon scales had even been knocked off.</p><p></p><p>The other star beasts couldn't help but persuade him, "Don't keep slamming yourself, take a break. You can't escape anyway. </p><p></p><p>If you keep this up, you'll end up killing yourself before you even manage to get out.</p><p></p><p>The saddest part is, even if you kill yourself, that human is most likely not going to let you go and will just revive you again."</p><p></p><p>"Yeah, now you're just hurting yourself for nothing."</p><p></p><p>"Shut up, you fools! As star beasts, how can you be willing to be the pets of humans? I am Feng Long, one of the three great generals under the Tiger God! How could I ever be like you, mere pets?</p><p></p><p>Blood Explosion Technique! Activate!"</p><p></p><p>In the next moment, Feng Long unleashed the Blood Explosion Technique once again. </p><p></p><p>Each time he used this technique, the damage to himself was immense. </p><p></p><p>But at this moment, in order to escape this accursed place, he had to find a way to break through, even if it meant grievous injury.</p><p></p><p>A few minutes later, the darkness dissipated and the blood energy gathered. Feng Long's lips curled up slightly.</p><p></p><p>Had he finally managed to escape this place? </p><p></p><p>How could the mere sealing techniques of these humans possibly contain a powerful expert like him? However, before he could feel relieved, a familiar, nightmarish voice reached his ears again.</p><p></p><p>"See, I told you it's useless. You just wouldn't listen. Now you've blown yourself up for nothing, haven't you?"</p><p></p><p>He mechanically turned his head, looking at Saimuel and the others with utter disbelief, completely collapsing. What was going on? Why? He had used his Blood Explosion Technique, yet he still couldn't escape this secret space.</p><p></p><p>Was he dreaming?</p><p></p><p>Heavens, if this is a nightmare, please wake me up quickly!</p><p>I really can't take it anymore.</p><p></p><p>Meanwhile, the Azure Ox had already kicked Feng Long and fled as fast as possible after sacrificing Feng Long.</p><p></p><p>Even though the opponent was strong, as long as he could buy himself a single second, he would be able to escape the Jianghai City.</p><p></p><p>This way, as long as he concealed his aura, he wouldn't be caught by that human Monarch expert.</p><p></p><p>Then he would find an opportunity to flee back to the Star Battlefield and report this to the Tiger God.</p><p></p><p>Since Feng Long would definitely be slain by that human expert, he didn't need to worry about anyone ratting him out. </p><p></p><p>Later, he could just make up a story about Feng Long heroically sacrificing himself in battle, while he tried his best to save him but ultimately failed and had to retreat.</p><p></p><p>He might even get a reward for this. </p><p></p><p>And even if he didn't get a reward, with Feng Long gone, he would be the last of the Tiger God's three great generals remaining.</p><p></p><p>From then on, he would be the Tiger God's sole right-hand man. </p><p></p><p>Without relying on him, who else could the Tiger God turn to?</p><p></p><p>He would truly be the one below the heavens and above the myriad.</p><p></p><p>Perfect!</p><p></p><p>However, just as he was thinking this, a figure appeared in front of him, standing in the sky, one hand behind his back, gazing up at the moonlight, as if quietly calming his mind.</p><p></p><p>The figure had obviously noticed him.</p><p></p><p>"Hmph! Ignorant human, seeing this general approach, you still don't flee? Looking to die? Since I've come down to the mortal realm, I haven't had my fill of eating people yet, so I'll use you as an appetizer."</p><p></p><p>The Azure Ox sneered, raising his hand and unleashing a punch, the light of the punch like a raging bull, the power immense, as if a azure ox phantom was faintly visible on the fist, its might soaring!</p><p>This was his strongest punch - the Raging Wind Emperor Fist! It was a variant of the Azure Ox Clan's fist techniques, which could transform into the Thunderous Emperor Fist, Raging Wind Emperor Fist, Heavy Earth Emperor Fist, and so on.</p><p></p><p>Among these, his Raging Wind Emperor Fist was extremely powerful, the fist technique heavy and the speed dizzying.</p><p>Even among those of the same level, few could withstand this punch.</p><p></p><p>The opponent was doomed!</p><p></p><p>But just as he thought he could easily knock the opponent away with one punch and then devour him, an unexpected event occurred.</p><p></p><p>The figure suddenly manifested a blade in his palm, and the blade flashed like a dragon, the terrifying blade qi striking directly against his fist.</p><p></p><p>Boom! The blade qi and his Raging Wind Emperor Fist collided, instantly causing an explosion.</p><p></p><p>The massive shockwave reverberated through his body, shattering all his internal organs! A single blade, had grievously wounded him! His entire body was blasted away like a cannonball.</p><p></p><p>"Damn it!" </p><p></p><p>The Azure Ox spat out a mouthful of blood in mid-air.</p><p></p><p>His huge ox eyes were filled with bewilderment and disbelief.</p><p></p><p>Even now, he couldn't understand, this was just a small Jianghai City!</p><p></p><p>This was not some massive human metropolis! This place was not even that big!</p><p></p><p>Here is the full English translation of the Chinese excerpt:</p><p></p><p>It's not as big as his own territory.</p><p></p><p>Why are there so many powerful experts in such a small place? Each one is terrifyingly formidable! As a mighty half-divine beast expert, I can't even withstand them? Is the heavens playing a special joke on me tonight?</p><p></p><p>And that figure, after unleashing that strike, also began to tremble slightly.</p><p></p><p>"Damn it! I didn't expect a half-divine beast-level star beast to suddenly burst out here, causing a huge disturbance in my spiritual energy. I've been painstakingly cultivating here, trying to absorb the essence of the moonlight to nourish my soul body.</p><p></p><p>Now the demonic nature is surging again!</p><p></p><p>I must completely suppress it, otherwise I, Li Liushui, will turn into a ruthless demon that endangers the Nine Provinces!"</p><p></p><p>After spitting, he immediately used the Buddhist beads on his wrist to suppress it, reciting Buddhist sutras to forcibly suppress the murderous intent within.</p><p></p><p>On the other side, the Blue Ox fell heavily in a certain place in the Jianghai City, suddenly blasting a large pit in the ground.</p><p></p><p>Boomâ€”! "Pfft!"</p><p></p><p>He suddenly spat out a mouthful of fresh blood.</p><p></p><p>Unavoidable, that strike had landed directly on his fist, stirring up his spiritual energy, causing it to go out of control and shatter his internal organs, directly putting him in a severely wounded state.</p><p></p><p>In his current state, he is as fragile as a small master-level star beast. Not to mention encountering those two human experts just now.</p><p></p><p>Even if he encountered a small human master, he would probably be killed without a proper burial.</p><p></p><p>"No, I can't keep going like this. With my current strength, I might be killed by even a small human master. </p><p></p><p>If I die at the hands of a small human master, won't I become the laughing stock of the entire starry sky?</p><p></p><p>No, I absolutely can't let that happen."</p><p></p><p>He needs to find a place to hide first, and after restoring some of his cultivation, he will immediately flee this place and return to the starry sky battlefield to find Lord Tiger God for treatment.</p><p></p><p>But at this moment, a melodious singing voice suddenly came from the distance.</p><p></p><p>"I am the happy flower picker, with strong flower-picking skills."</p><p></p><p>"Damn it! Could it be that coincidental? In this remote place, I actually encountered a human?"</p><p></p><p>The Blue Ox spat out a mouthful of blood, clenching his fists, his eyes filled with murderous intent.</p><p></p><p>But moments later, when the other party entered his line of sight, his murderous intent suddenly disappeared without a trace.</p><p></p><p>Not only that, he even laughed happily.</p><p></p><p>The reason was simple - he saw that the other party had cat ears on her head and a long tail protruding from her behind.</p><p></p><p>This person... she's not human!</p><p></p><p>Hahaha, she's not human!</p><p></p><p>She's actually a star beast! This is heaven-sent help! By encountering this star beast, he can ask her to help him recover his injuries.</p><p></p><p>Since they are both star beasts, she definitely won't refuse him.</p><p></p><p>As long as she can help him regain a little bit of strength, even if it's just reaching the Celestial Patriarch realm at the seventh grade, he would be able to activate the teleportation formation.</p><p></p><p>At that time, he can easily escape back to the starry sky battlefield and say that he has escaped with his life.</p><p></p><p>Thinking of this, he immediately stood up, enduring the pain in his body, and rushed towards the other party.</p><p></p><p>"Friend! Over here! Over here!"</p><p></p><p>The Illusory Lotus, who was about to go pick flowers, was startled when she saw the other party.</p><p></p><p>"This is... a star beast? Fuck!"</p><p></p><p>She couldn't help but curse.</p><p></p><p>Because she could clearly feel that the other party's aura was extraordinary.</p><p></p><p>Although the other party was now severely injured and his aura was greatly diminished, Illusory Lotus could still feel that his aura was above the peak of the Celestial Patriarch realm at the ninth grade!</p><p></p><p>What a powerful star beast! This guy might be much stronger than Noel Fei and Samuel!</p><p></p><p>But now, he seems so weak that a single swipe from her could probably knock him unconscious.</p><p></p><p>This star beast is extremely powerful, it's just that he is currently injured, so he is not as strong. If she could offer him to her master, and have her master heal his injuries and then release him into the breeding ground, wouldn't that be a great achievement for her?</p><p></p><p>At that time, if her master is pleased, maybe she will even reward her with something.</p><p></p><p>If she gets some little tadpoles or something, oh my, she can use the cat to control her master!</p><p></p><p>Just thinking about it makes her feel excited.</p><p></p><p>At this time, the Blue Ox had already run in front of her.</p><p></p><p>"Friend, we are both star beasts, in times of emergency, please help me. I was just severely injured by humans. If you can help me recover my injuries, I will be deeply grateful. The reward will be beyond your imagination."</p><p></p><p>Illusory Lotus: "!"</p><p></p><p>"You are the greatest reward I can imagine."</p><p></p><p>With that, she extended her sharp claws.</p>

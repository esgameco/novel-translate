        <h1>Chapter 212</h1>
        <div class="content">
            <p>Here is the full English translation of the Chinese excerpt:</p><p></p><p>High up in the sky, after Ye Xiao made a move with his palm, he did not let his guard down. He just raised his head and looked in another direction.</p><p></p><p>There, the star beast from earlier was standing, but he was slightly panting, obviously having used a secret technique to instantly boost his speed to the limit.</p><p></p><p>And he had managed to avoid Ye Xiao's attack.</p><p></p><p>After taking a couple of deep breaths, his expression became calm again. But his eyes no longer held the same disdainful look as before, replaced instead by an extremely cautious gaze.</p><p></p><p>"Wow, I underestimated you. I didn't expect you to be a Saint Sovereign of the Ninth Rank as well! No wonder Su Shan and the others were killed! You must have encountered them in Jianghai City, you brat!"</p><p></p><p>Ye Xiao narrowed his eyes slightly.</p><p></p><p>The other party had mentioned Su Shan, which meant he was one of Tiger God's people? And he was also a Ninth Rank star beast?! At this moment, Ye Xiao suddenly felt fond of Tiger God.</p><p></p><p>He had been worrying about where to find a Ninth Rank star beast to raise on his farm.</p><p></p><p>Unexpectedly, the other had delivered one right to him.</p><p></p><p>The corners of Ye Xiao's mouth curled up slightly as he launched another attack.</p><p></p><p>The Infinite Calamity Finger.</p><p></p><p>The Infinite Calamity Finger was characterized by its swiftness and strength. </p><p></p><p>It was several times faster than the Tathagata Palm.</p><p></p><p>Boom! The next moment, the Infinite Calamity Finger exploded at the other's location.</p><p></p><p>But once again, he had managed to escape.</p><p></p><p>"Give up, human. You don't know the name of this general. I am Saimuel, the Wind God under Tiger God. Speed is my greatest specialty.</p><p></p><p>Your attacks may be powerful, but unfortunately, they are no match for my speed, like a child's game of house against me. </p><p>Your attacks can't even keep up with my body.</p><p></p><p>Trying to injure me? Haha, you're just wasting your effort."</p><p></p><p>However, the moment he finished speaking, Ye Xiao suddenly arrived beside him with lightning-fast speed.</p><p></p><p>"So fast!"</p><p></p><p>Saimuel's pupils constricted.</p><p></p><p>He simply couldn't believe his eyes.</p><p></p><p>Ye Xiao's speed was almost on par with his own signature movement technique?</p><p></p><p>But now he dared not be the slightest bit careless, for Ye Xiao's fist was already thundering towards him.</p><p></p><p>The Great Extinction Fist! </p><p></p><p>The terrifying fist power instantly drained all the spiritual energy around, leaving only a vacuum.</p><p>A thick aura of death shrouded the iron fist.</p><p></p><p>Saimuel was very clear-headed - he knew that with his cultivation and strength, he could not withstand this punch.</p><p></p><p>If he fought Ye Xiao head-on, he would undoubtedly lose.</p><p></p><p>Even more terrifying was that the other's speed was even faster than his own. If they both sustained injuries, the next moment could very well be their death.</p><p></p><p>His mind was very sharp, his thought processes reaching an extreme speed.</p><p></p><p>In an instant, he had already come up with a plan.</p><p></p><p>The next moment, he swung out a fist to meet Ye Xiao's.</p><p></p><p>Although they were both Ninth Rank Celestial Sovereigns, his fist appeared so pale and powerless before Ye Xiao's.</p><p></p><p>The moment they collided, his fist exploded into a bloody mist, just like tofu.</p><p></p><p>A flash of pain crossed his face, but it quickly vanished.</p><p></p><p>It was replaced by a deep excitement.</p><p></p><p>The next second, he had appeared hundreds of miles away.</p><p></p><p>"Human, you're ruthless! But don't be too proud of yourself. When the day of the Calamity of the Beasts arrives, I, Saimuel, will have Tiger God himself come to Jianghai City to destroy you.</p><p></p><p>I hope you don't commit suicide out of fear by then!"</p><p></p><p>Ye Xiao raised his eyebrows slightly.</p><p></p><p>It turned out that Saimuel had deliberately collided fists with him just now in order to unleash the Blood Explosion Technique.</p><p></p><p>Ye Xiao had read before that the essence blood was the most precious thing in the bodies of humans and star beasts.</p><p></p><p>When cultivating, refining the body, everyone's essence blood and flesh would be refined by spiritual energy over and over.</p><p></p><p>After countless refinements, it would contain a considerable amount of spiritual energy.</p><p></p><p>So in battle, if one felt they couldn't endure, they could choose to detonate their own essence blood, thereby obtaining a large amount of spiritual energy to ensure their technique instantly exceeded their normal power.</p><p></p><p>He didn't expect the other party to have this kind of technique as well.</p><p></p><p>At this time, Saimuel was already preparing to leave, but how could Ye Xiao let him go? </p><p>The fat meat had come to his doorstep, would he not eat it?</p><p></p><p>With a wave of the Plucking Star Hand, Saimuel's body was suddenly fixed in place.</p><p></p><p>He stiffened, revealing a trace of fear and shock.</p><p></p><p>Ye Xiao actually had a long-range control attack technique as well?</p><p>Just how many techniques had this human cultivated? How could he be so monstrous in combat skills, speed, and now even long-range control?</p><p></p><p>"How is this possible? How can this be? Release me!" </p><p>He roared furiously, gathering all his strength to try and break free from the restraint.</p><p></p><p>But unfortunately, Ye Xiao's spiritual energy was who knows how many levels higher than his own. No matter how he tried to enhance his own power, he could not budge Ye Xiao's power at all.</p><p></p><p>Ye Xiao's open right hand clenched slightly.</p><p></p><p>"Crack! Crack!"</p><p></p><p>"Ahhhhh, no—!"</p><p></p><p>Saimuel let out a scream of agony as Ye Xiao crushed him in an instant.</p><p></p><p>Here is the full English translation of the Chinese excerpt:</p><p></p><p>Exerting force, he forcibly suppressed and restrained the entire body of bones, and collected it back into the storage ring.</p><p></p><p>With a slight upward curve of the corners of his mouth, Ye Xiao was delighted. "The first innate ninth-grade divine sect beast has been successfully captured!"</p><p></p><p>Next, it would be placed in the breeding ground.</p><p></p><p>What a good divine beast, but he still didn't know what its true form was.</p><p></p><p>Hopefully, it would be a divine beast with a relatively delicious taste.</p><p></p><p>Of course, if it could lay eggs, that would be even better.</p><p></p><p>But it seemed to be a male, so it probably couldn't lay eggs.</p><p></p><p>Outside the library in Jianghai City, Huan Liuli came carrying a basket of spiritual flowers, unable to help but mock:</p><p></p><p>"Which idiot is this? Where else could they have gone? To actually come to our Jianghai City and encounter the master, isn't that just asking to die?"</p><p></p><p>Shaking her head, she entered the underground seal and placed the spiritual flowers inside.</p><p></p><p>"Hey! Bees, I've brought you the flowers for today. Hurry up and get to work! Convert all the flowers into honey. Don't delay the master's enjoyment tomorrow morning."</p><p></p><p>Huan Liuli threw the spiritual flowers in front of Su Shan.</p><p></p><p>Su Shan spat at her.</p><p></p><p>"Traitor! You disgrace of the divine beast realm, you're not even qualified to order me around!"</p><p></p><p>"Tch."</p><p></p><p>Huan Liuli glanced at her.</p><p></p><p>"Do you have an itch again? Do you believe I won't call the master over right now?"</p><p></p><p>"You—!"</p><p></p><p>Hearing that Huan Liuli was going to call Ye Xiao over, Su Shan's expression immediately became much more obedient.</p><p></p><p>Although she really couldn't stand Huan Liuli's arrogant and deserving-of-a-beating attitude, she still had to show some respect for Ye Xiao.</p><p></p><p>After all, if she didn't show respect, she would really get beaten.</p><p></p><p>Seeing her become obedient, Huan Liuli nodded in satisfaction, then looked around at the other divine beasts with an air of superiority.</p><p></p><p>"Recently, all of you need to be more well-behaved. Don't give our master a hard time, and he won't give you a hard time either.</p><p></p><p>Get along harmoniously, and wholeheartedly serve the master.</p><p> </p><p>If the master is well, then you will be well, and we will all be well, everyone will be happy, understand?"</p><p></p><p>With that, she turned around and walked away with her hands behind her back, imitating the eight-character stance.</p><p></p><p>The other divine beasts behind her were so angry that their teeth were itching.</p><p></p><p>One by one, they stared fixatedly at her back, wishing they could tear her to shreds, swallow her alive, and rip her to pieces.</p><p></p><p>"That damned eunuch cat, one day I'll skin her and tear out her tendons. Let her taste the suffering we've endured today."</p><p></p><p>Noel Fei spat.</p><p></p><p>Moyu sighed softly.</p><p></p><p>"It's a pity that Tiger God isn't here. If the old man were here, we definitely wouldn't have suffered such humiliation."</p><p></p><p>Noel Fei's attention was drawn by her words.</p><p></p><p>"Little cow, are you talking about the Shaking Star Tiger?"</p><p></p><p>Moyu and the other three were suddenly startled.</p><p></p><p>"Senior, could it be that you know our Tiger God?"</p><p></p><p>"Hehe, not only do I know him, but we were also considered peers back then.</p><p></p><p>It's just that I came to the mortal world earlier and was trapped in the Shaolin Temple.</p><p></p><p>I never expected that after so many years, he has already become a king-level divine beast!</p><p></p><p>If I hadn't come down at that time, I should also have become an existence at that level by now, instead of becoming someone else's prisoner, without any dignity."</p><p></p><p>"I never expected Senior's identity to be so high! We previously showed disrespect, and we hope Noel Fei Senior can forgive us."</p><p></p><p>"No need, you are all just juniors. I have been sealed in this world for several hundred years, so it is normal that you don't know my name."</p><p></p><p>Pausing, he spoke again:</p><p></p><p>"By the way, I remember that Shaking Star Tiger had three relatively powerful geniuses under him, right? Why haven't they come? Their strength should be even greater than yours. </p><p></p><p>If it were the three of them, you definitely wouldn't have suffered such torment.</p><p> </p><p>That imperial bloodline would definitely have been brought to the starry sky as well."</p><p></p><p>Hearing this, Moyu's eyes lit up with a hint of admiration.</p><p></p><p>"Senior must be referring to our Tiger God's three great generals - Wind God Sai Mu'er, Strength God Qingniu, and War God Feng Long! They are now the three pillars of our Tiger God's tribe. Each one is the left and right hand of Tiger God."</p><p></p><p>"Oh? So those three little brats have become so powerful now. Unexpected."</p><p></p><p>Noel Fei sighed, and the silent Iron Cow, who seemed to have gotten excited about the topic, also chimed in, "Of course, they are now the most popular idols in our entire Tiger God tribe.</p><p></p><p>Each of their strengths is as lofty as the heavens.</p><p></p><p>Just take Wind God Sai Mu'er for example.</p><p> </p><p>His movement techniques are simply extraordinary.</p><p> </p><p>There is no one in the entire Tiger God tribe who can catch him.</p><p> </p><p>Let alone that human child."</p><p></p><p>Moyu also nodded.</p><p></p><p>"That's right, if Wind God Sai Mu'er were to come, he definitely wouldn't have been caught by that bastard."</p>

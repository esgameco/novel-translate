        <h1>Chapter 288</h1>
        <div class="content">
            <p>Here is the full English translation of the Chinese excerpt:</p><p></p><p>Ye Xiao followed the guidance of the young vixen and they proceeded forward. From above the Silver Fox Valley, the two of them looked like a pair of small tadpoles slowly swimming towards the deepest part of the valley.</p><p></p><p>What surprised Ye Xiao was that the architecture here was very similar to the ancient architecture of the human race. It was mainly constructed with bronze, resembling an ancient bronze palace.</p><p></p><p>As if sensing Ye Xiao's puzzlement, the young vixen explained, "The architecture of the Silver Fox Clan is mostly derived from the ancient times of the Nine Provinces. It is said that one of our ancestors had a relationship with a powerful Emperor Realm cultivator from the Nine Provinces.</p><p></p><p>"That is why we in the Silver Fox Valley have inherited some of the legacy of the human Emperors."</p><p></p><p>Ye Xiao nodded in understanding.</p><p></p><p>Soon, several figures emerged from the palace - they were the Empress of the Silver Fox Clan. She wore a luxurious yet dignified fur coat, and a colorful crown shaped like a fox on her head. Her appearance was alluring yet imposing, giving just the right sense of distance, making Ye Xiao think of one word to describe her: "Both pure and seductive!"</p><p></p><p>The Silver Fox Clan was indeed filled with beauties, no wonder they could captivate even powerful Emperor Realm cultivators from the human race.</p><p></p><p>However, Ye Xiao remained quite clear-headed. He knew that beauty was as sharp as a knife, and without the diamond vajra, one should not dare to touch those "crescent moons."</p><p></p><p>"Mr. Ye, it has been a while. You have become even more handsome than before," the Empress said.</p><p></p><p>Truly a vixen, her words were as sweet as honey.</p><p></p><p>"Young Master Yin is still cultivating, and should be done soon. Please enter the Fox Clan's main palace and rest for a while," the Empress invited.</p><p></p><p>"Very well," Ye Xiao replied.</p><p></p><p>Upon entering the palace, the Empress immediately ordered the fox maidens to bring fresh spiritual fruits and teas, all of excellent quality, showing their sincerity.</p><p></p><p>"Mr. Ye, these are the unique spiritual fruits and teas of our Silver Fox Valley. Please have a taste," the Empress said.</p><p></p><p>Ye Xiao thanked her and took a sip of the tea, while also observing the Silver Fox Valley.</p><p></p><p>The overall level of the Silver Fox Valley was not bad. The Empress herself had reached the Half-Step Monarch Realm. Besides her, there were a full twelve Innate Nine-Rank Saint Monarchs, as well as many Innate Eight-Rank and Seven-Rank Saint Monarchs.</p><p></p><p>The total number of foxes in the Silver Fox Valley was at most around 200,000. Even the lowest-ranking little foxes had cultivated to at least the Post-Innate Fifth-Rank realm.</p><p></p><p>No wonder the Silver Fox Clan could survive in this perilous starry sky. This force was indeed not to be underestimated.</p><p></p><p>After all, the number of star beasts was vast, but the proportion of powerful ones among them was very low. Given the same numbers, the human cultivators would definitely surpass the star beasts, and the ratio of human experts would also exceed that of the star beasts.</p><p></p><p>The Silver Fox Clan was not numerous, but they did not have any deadweight. They followed the path of being short and powerful. Combined with their remote and secluded geographical location, without any particularly powerful star beast races nearby, they were able to survive steadily.</p><p></p><p>"Mr. Ye, you have always helped our Fox Clan's Saint Child. Our Fox Clan repays kindness. Unfortunately, you were previously in the human world, so we could not visit you. Now that you have come to the Silver Fox Valley, please feel free to let us know if you need anything. Do not be polite!"</p><p></p><p>"It is you all who are too polite. Xiao Ning and I are friends, and helping each other is nothing extraordinary. You do not need to take it to heart so much," Ye Xiao replied courteously.</p><p></p><p>The two continued their polite exchange, neither really saying much.</p><p></p><p>Meanwhile, in the depths of the Silver Fox Valley, a cave suddenly erupted with an extremely fierce aura.</p><p></p><p>Sitting in the cave was none other than Ning Yuhen.</p><p></p><p>He had completely shed his previous youthful innocence. Both his appearance and demeanor were now much more refined and mature. Although he still had a scholarly air, it was far better than before, when he had seemed like a young girl.</p><p></p><p>Now, at a glance, one could tell he was a real man.</p><p></p><p>Opening his eyes, his pure purple irises had become even more profound and resolute, exuding a sense of maturity.</p><p></p><p>"Just one more step, only one more step, and I will be able to successfully break through to the Innate Nine-Rank Saint Monarch realm! Then I will also be considered a powerful expert, and I can protect the Master so that he does not suffer any mishaps."</p><p></p><p>Ning Yuhen clenched his fists, his eyes shining with determination. He then called out towards the outside of the cave:</p><p></p><p>"Has the honored guest I invited arrived yet?"</p><p></p><p>A voice soon came from outside the cave.</p><p></p><p>"Replying to the Saint Child, the guest has already arrived and is in the Silver Fox Palace."</p><p></p><p>Ning Yuhen's face lit up, and he immediately rushed out, becoming a beam of light heading straight for the Silver Fox Palace.</p><p></p><p>In the blink of an eye, he arrived at the Silver Fox Palace and saw Ye Xiao's figure. At that moment, his eyes couldn't help but become slightly red and misty.</p><p></p><p>"Master, you have finally come!"</p><p></p><p>Ye Xiao, seeing Ning Yuhen, was finally able to end the awkward exchange with the Empress. That Empress was too polite, with too many empty courtesies, which was exactly the kind of situation Ye Xiao disliked the most.</p><p></p><p>Moreover, she had even summoned a group of little vixens in thin gauze to dance, claiming it was the traditional cultural exchange of the Fox Clan, which left Ye Xiao utterly speechless.</p><p></p><p>Putting on such showy performances was not as good as simply...</p><p></p><p>Here is the full English translation of the Chinese excerpt:</p><p></p><p>He took several steel rods and strung them all together to make a delicious roasted fox feast.</p><p></p><p>Looking at Ning Yuhen, who had undergone a perfect transformation, Ye Xiao praised, "It seems that during these days in the Silver Fox Clan, you have grown a lot."</p><p></p><p>Ning Yuhen walked up quickly and bowed deeply to Ye Xiao.</p><p></p><p>"Yuhen also needs to thank the manager for his help and protection in the past. If it weren't for the manager, Yuhen would have died in Jianghai City long ago, and how could I have achieved today's accomplishments." The Fox Queen, seeing Ning Yuhen arrive, also considerately left the space for the two of them.</p><p></p><p>"Yuhen, since you're here, you can be the one to entertain Mr. Ye. I'll have the kitchen prepare a sumptuous dinner for Mr. Ye to enjoy."</p><p></p><p>"Thank you, Grandma."</p><p></p><p>Ning Yuhen thanked her, and the Fox Queen smiled slightly at Ye Xiao, exchanged a few courtesies, and then considerately withdrew.</p><p></p><p>When the hall was left with only Ye Xiao and Ning Yuhen, Ning Yuhen finally spoke:</p><p></p><p>"Manager, I've been away for a while, how have you been?"</p><p></p><p>Ye Xiao nodded.</p><p></p><p>"Everything's been fine."</p><p></p><p>"How about the friends in Jianghai City?"</p><p></p><p>"They're all doing well too."</p><p></p><p>"That's good. I've heard lately that there's been a lot of trouble in the human world, and I've been worried about it."</p><p></p><p>Ye Xiao raised his eyebrows slightly.</p><p></p><p>"Can you get news about the human world even from here?"</p><p></p><p>"Of course, in fact, the blockade between the human world and the star beasts is not that tight, there are still some means to find out news about each other."</p><p></p><p>"I see. By the way, you told me there's a human imperial legacy inheritance here, where is it?"</p><p></p><p>Ning Yuhen smiled wryly.</p><p></p><p>"Manager, we finally get to see each other, and you bring up cultivation matters right away. Don't you have any other hobbies besides cultivation?"</p><p></p><p>"I have a few, recently I've been growing flowers, raising some plants, and raising some small animals."</p><p></p><p>"The manager really has a leisurely life. I'd love to see what kind of small animals the manager is raising? They must be very cute, right?"</p><p></p><p>Ning Yuhen was a little envious.</p><p></p><p>"They're not bad, when you have time to come back, I'll let you take a look."</p><p></p><p>"Okay."</p><p></p><p>After a pause, Ning Yuhen spoke again:</p><p></p><p>"In fact, we only recently discovered the human imperial legacy inheritance.</p><p></p><p>Before, it was always hidden deep in the valley, and a recent heavy rain washed away the slope, exposing part of the ruins, and that's when we discovered this relic.</p><p></p><p>Its owner was a human imperial realm expert from about three thousand years ago. He was the beloved of one of our Silver Fox Clan ancestors.</p><p></p><p>In his later years, he chose to come to the Silver Fox Valley and eventually perished here.</p><p></p><p>He set up a restriction, and to open this restriction and obtain the legacy inheritance, one needs the fresh blood of both a human and a Silver Fox Clan member.</p><p></p><p>That is to say, a human and a Silver Fox Clan member must simultaneously use their spiritual blood to open it in order to enter his legacy site."</p><p></p><p>"Three thousand years ago, an imperial realm expert, could it be him?"</p><p></p><p>Ye Xiao thought of a certain emperor.</p><p></p><p>Ning Yuhen smiled faintly and said:</p><p></p><p>"It seems the manager has already guessed the identity of the other party, that's right, it's the historical figure of the human world, King Zhou!"</p><p></p><p>"It must be him."</p><p></p><p>Ye Xiao's memory of King Zhou the emperor was quite deep, after all, the previous world's Fengshen Yanyi had gone through countless versions. But the TV dramas were TV dramas, and history was history.</p><p></p><p>He knew that in history, in the early period, King Zhou was a very wise ruler, expanding territories and making a series of achievements, contributing indelibly to the expansion of the Nine Provinces.</p><p></p><p>It was only in his later years that he became addicted to wine and women, ultimately leading to the downfall of his kingdom.</p><p></p><p>However, the history of this world must be different from the previous one.</p><p></p><p>The first and most important point is that the replacement of dynasties in this world is not as turbulent as in the previous world. </p><p></p><p>Basically, when the descendants of a dynasty could no longer break through the imperial realm and continue to fight for the human race, it meant the end of that dynasty.</p><p></p><p>And the next person to break through the imperial realm would ascend the throne as emperor legitimately.</p><p></p><p>The only enemy of the human race is the star beasts! In addition, there is another point, this world has star beasts, so some of the more fantastic things in the previous world's history actually exist in reality here.</p><p></p><p>For example, Daji being a fox, in Ye Xiao's previous life, that would certainly not have been possible. </p><p></p><p>But in this world, she is a real fox spirit, and even a powerful one of the Silver Fox Clan.</p><p></p><p>Ye Xiao just didn't expect that King Zhou would choose to place his legacy in the hiding place of the Silver Fox Clan after his death, rather than in the human realm of the Nine Provinces.</p><p></p><p>This is quite strange.</p><p></p><p>Could it be that he was really bewitched by the foxes? It shouldn't be the case, after all, in this world he is an imperial realm expert, belonging to the top combat power of this world! Perhaps there was an unavoidable reason.</p><p></p><p>Ye Xiao vaguely felt that he might be able to get some news about the God Clan from him.</p>

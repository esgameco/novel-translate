        <h1>Chapter 38</h1>
        <div class="content">
            <p>Here is the full English translation of the excerpt from the Chinese novel:</p><p></p><p>Ye Xiao decisively refused.</p><p></p><p>After work hours, work is strictly prohibited.</p><p></p><p>This is the bottom line of a free hobby enthusiast.</p><p></p><p>"A new seafood buffet restaurant has opened in the city center, 580 yuan per person, all-you-can-eat! I'll treat you."</p><p></p><p>"Wait for me for ten minutes."</p><p></p><p>Ye Xiao put down his chopsticks and got up to leave.</p><p></p><p>Although the bottom line is good, one cannot insist on it too much, that would be unfair to the stomach.</p><p></p><p>Ning Yuhen: "???"</p><p></p><p>"Mr. Ye, you've only eaten a few bites, are you not going to eat anymore?"</p><p></p><p>"I'm not eating anymore, I'm in a hurry."</p><p></p><p>Ten minutes later, Ye Xiao went to the defense team with his books.</p><p></p><p>Gu Hai had already put on the defense team's uniform.</p><p></p><p>"I didn't expect you to look so decent in this outfit."</p><p></p><p>"Of course, after all, I'm your brother."</p><p></p><p>"Wasn't it supposed to be tomorrow that you start work? Why are you wearing the uniform today?"</p><p></p><p>"I just got it. My father-in-law arranged everything, and he just had me pick up the defense team uniform."</p><p></p><p>Ye Xiao handed over the information he had collected about the star beasts to Gu Hai.</p><p></p><p>"Good buddy, come, let's go inside and deliver the books, and I'll treat you to a meal."</p><p></p><p>Ye Xiao nodded and followed Gu Hai into the defense team.</p><p></p><p>"We're all men, why are you touching me?"</p><p></p><p>"Just playing around!"</p><p></p><p>"What are you playing? Am I that close to you?"</p><p></p><p>The defense team was as chaotic as ever, with all kinds of bizarre things happening, as if these bizarre things would never cease to exist.</p><p></p><p>Ye Xiao and Gu Hai walked up to Old Lu.</p><p></p><p>"Dad, here are the materials you wanted."</p><p></p><p>"Mm-hmm! Just leave them here. Little Ye is here too?"</p><p></p><p>Ye Xiao greeted "Uncle Lu", and Old Lu nodded, taking the cigarette stub from the corner of his mouth and crushing it in the ashtray.</p><p></p><p>Gu Hai followed closely and said softly, "Dad, if there's nothing else, we'll head back now."</p><p></p><p>"Go on, but don't forget to come to work on time tomorrow. If you're late, I'll kick your ass."</p><p></p><p>"Don't worry, I won't embarrass you."</p><p></p><p>"Go home early, don't stay out too late, it's not safe to be alone at home at night."</p><p></p><p>"I know, I'm going to have a meal with Ye Xiao."</p><p></p><p>The two bid farewell to Old Lu and immediately headed outside.</p><p></p><p>Ye Xiao's spiritual power swept through the entire defense team, but he didn't sense anything unusual.</p><p></p><p>He couldn't help but ask, "What are you using the star beast information for?"</p><p></p><p>Gu Hai's face became a bit serious.</p><p></p><p>"Recently, there have been some suspicious and bizarre incidents of people attacking others in our Jianghai City. They just caught a few more and locked them in the sealed capsules outside."</p><p></p><p>"What do these people attacking others have to do with star beasts?"</p><p></p><p>"Normally, there wouldn't be any connection, but in this case, there definitely is. If someone is bitten by them, it won't be long before the bitten person also starts biting others.</p><p></p><p>Does this sound like it's human-made to you?"</p><p></p><p>Ye Xiao couldn't help but find it strange, it sounded like a kind of biological crisis. When he passed by the sealed capsules in the defense team's courtyard, Ye Xiao used his Taixuan Tiangong to scan the captive criminals.</p><p></p><p>The criminals were controlled in their respective sealed capsules, seemingly sedated, so they were resting for the time being. However, even while they were resting, Ye Xiao's Taixuan Tiangong could thoroughly scan them from the inside out.</p><p></p><p>Their bodies didn't show any abnormalities, at most just some scratch or bite marks.</p><p></p><p>Here is my translation of the Chinese excerpt:</p><p></p><p>Ye Xiao, who had mastered the Taixuan Tiangong technique, easily discovered that their souls had been infected to varying degrees - they had turned red and become agitated.</p><p></p><p>"What is this...?"</p><p></p><p>"Old Ye, what's wrong?"</p><p></p><p>"Nothing, I just feel like we should check their souls. I remember the Star Beast Records mentioned a type of star beast that carries a toxin, which can make a person's soul become scorched and agitated. It can also spread through sweat and saliva from wounds."</p><p></p><p>"Really?"</p><p></p><p>Ye Xiao nodded.</p><p></p><p>"I'll go report this right away."</p><p></p><p>Gu Haixing rushed excitedly back to the defense squad, while Ye Xiao remained in the courtyard, pondering.</p><p></p><p>Last time with the tiger beast incident, he couldn't say anything, which resulted in a small-scale beast disaster in Jianghai City. So this time, he took the opportunity to give them a heads up, so the defense squad could be prepared.</p><p></p><p>After all, he had been living in Jianghai City for a long time and had developed some feelings for the place. He had friends like Gu Hai and Qin Yuyuan, as well as many colleagues here. It would be best to avoid a repeat of the previous tragedy.</p><p></p><p>However, these consecutive incidents related to star beasts left Ye Xiao somewhat perplexed. Were all these events connected? Were they all aimed at reviving King Aier? If so, the mastermind behind it must still be alive, and such incidents would likely continue to occur.</p><p></p><p>It was truly quite vexing.</p><p></p><p>Soon, Gu Hai came running out again, excited.</p><p></p><p>"Old Ye, your brain really is sharp. The defense squad members who cultivate spiritual techniques did have issues with their souls. You've made a great contribution this time!"</p><p></p><p>"I just casually mentioned it, I'm glad they were able to investigate and find the problem."</p><p></p><p>"Your mouth is truly blessed. Come, let me treat you to a good meal today. Eat as much as you want, it's all on me."</p><p></p><p>"Isn't that the whole point of a buffet, to eat as much as you want?"</p><p></p><p>"Don't ruin it, Old Ye, just let me have my face."</p><p></p><p>An hour later.</p><p></p><p>"How much? You're telling me how much again?"</p><p></p><p>"Your total bill for tonight is 4,800."</p><p></p><p>Hearing this, Gu Hai's mind went blank.</p><p></p><p>"Isn't this a self-service seafood restaurant? Why are there additional charges? And so expensive?"</p><p></p><p>The server politely smiled. "We do have a self-service seafood buffet, but some dishes have limited servings. For example, the Australian giant lobster, each person is limited to one, and every additional one is charged 250 yuan. You and your friend didn't eat anything else, only the Australian giant lobster, so the total came to 4,800."</p><p></p><p>Gu Hai slammed the table.</p><p></p><p>"Are you guys taking advantage of the customers? Why didn't you tell me earlier?"</p><p></p><p>"We did tell this gentleman, and he said he understood. We thought he would tell you."</p><p></p><p>Gu Hai: "???"</p><p></p><p>He turned to look at Ye Xiao, who was casually picking his teeth with a toothpick.</p><p></p><p>"You asked me to bring you here to eat, I thought you knew the rules of this place."</p><p></p><p>Gu Hai's face twitched uncontrollably.</p><p></p><p>It was intentional! Absolutely intentional!</p><p></p><p>Because Ye Xiao had just analyzed for him that the Australian lobster was the most expensive item in the entire seafood restaurant, and eating it would be the best way to recoup the cost. So they only ate the Australian lobster, and Ye Xiao even fed two to the Illusion Jade.</p><p></p><p>"Old Ye, you've become so cunning. No wonder you can't find a girlfriend, you're too calculating. Damn it!"</p><p></p><p>Ye Xiao shrugged.</p><p></p><p>"You said you'd treat me, no matter how much I ate."</p><p></p><p>"You're ruthless!"</p>

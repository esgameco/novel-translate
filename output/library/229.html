        <h1>Chapter 229</h1>
        <div class="content">
            <p>Here is the full English translation of the Chinese excerpt:</p><p></p><p>"Immortal and indestructible gods?"</p><p></p><p>Ye Xiao was somewhat taken aback. Is the ultimate destination for human martial artists the legendary gods who stand between heaven and earth, immortal and undying?</p><p></p><p>No wonder, no wonder these star beasts want to occupy the human race.</p><p></p><p>Tens of billions of people can only refine a drop of divine blood, and that drop of divine blood is the extravagant hope of becoming a god!</p><p></p><p>I guess if it were the human race, they would also be unable to resist the urge to deal with the star beasts in order to refine divine blood.</p><p></p><p>"Yes! Even though the lifespan of the star beasts is very long, it is still limited. Like the divine beasts, they can only live for tens of thousands of years at most, but in the vast universe, the eons of changes are just a fleeting moment.</p><p></p><p>Only by becoming an immortal and indestructible god can the star beasts live forever! Moreover, even if we star beasts don't attack the human race, if the human race cultivates such a powerful existence, won't they be pressing down on the heads of the star beasts? So, even for the sake of our own safety, we cannot allow the human race to develop to that extent.</p><p></p><p>I have already answered your questions. Can you let me go now? We had an agreement before."</p><p></p><p>Ye Xiao gave him a glance and directly activated his vast spiritual power, blasting it at the soul of the Yin Bat.</p><p></p><p>The Yin Bat's expression changed drastically.</p><p></p><p>"Damn human race! You are not trustworthy!"</p><p></p><p>Ye Xiao couldn't be bothered to respond to him.</p><p></p><p>Talk about integrity with the star beasts? </p><p>Has his brain been waterlogged? Since the questions have been answered, of course it's time to send him to the afterlife!</p><p>This guy has devoured countless human lives, should he be let go to continue eating people? At this moment, some powerful auras were rapidly approaching from the center of the city.</p><p></p><p>Ye Xiao's mind moved, and he collected the corpse of the opponent into his spatial ring, then instantly disappeared from the spot using the Divine Intent Technique.</p><p></p><p>Soon, several figures arrived quickly, and when they saw this scene, they were all shocked and speechless.</p><p></p><p>Such powerful destructive power!</p><p>There must have been an extremely powerful expert fighting here just now!</p><p></p><p>On Ye Xiao's side, he returned to the hotel, ready to refine the Yin Bat into a medicinal pill.</p><p>He didn't dare to eat the flesh of this thing, so he didn't have the idea of keeping it in a breeding farm.</p><p>This thing might have some unclean things in its body.</p><p>But by using the Myriad Elements Convergence to refine it into a medicinal pill, he wouldn't have to worry about that.</p><p></p><p>The Myriad Elements Convergence is an emperor-level alchemy technique, which has the absolute ability to remove any toxins from the body of a Xiantian Ninth-Grade Saint Monarch.</p><p></p><p>This encounter with the Yin Bat's sneak attack was actually a good thing.</p><p>At least, it made him know more about the true nature of this world.</p><p></p><p>Looking at the current situation, the next beast calamity will pose a serious threat to this world, and it may even lead to the complete annihilation of the entire human race.</p><p>But there is still hope, that is, if a super expert appears in the human race who can turn the tide of the battle.</p><p></p><p>He is currently at the Xiantian Ninth-Grade realm, and has not yet reached the King Realm.</p><p>The situation in the star battlefield is becoming more and more critical, and the next beast calamity should not be more than four years away.</p><p>In less than four years, can he break through to that realm? </p><p>If he fails to break through, or if the other powerful experts of this world cannot break through, will he be annihilated along with the human race of this world?</p><p>However, he soon shook his head and dismissed this thought.</p><p></p><p>Ye Xiao believes that there is always a way when heaven does not forsake a person.</p><p>The heavens once let him die of illness, but then gave him a chance to live again, so they should not be playing tricks on him.</p><p>First, return to the hotel and improve his own strength.</p><p></p><p>However, just as he arrived at the hotel entrance, he unexpectedly found a familiar figure standing there - Beitang Ce!</p><p>The old man was sitting on a flower bed next to the hotel, seemingly waiting for him.</p><p>Seeing him appear, he smiled and came over.</p><p></p><p>"Are you done?"</p><p></p><p>Beitang Ce seemed to know what Ye Xiao had been doing.</p><p>But Ye Xiao was not surprised.</p><p>His battle with the Yin Bat, two Xiantian Ninth-Grade Saint Monarch experts fighting, would have released powerful fluctuations that anyone, as long as they were somewhat strong, would have sensed were at the Saint Monarch level.</p><p>When he met Beitang Ce earlier in the evening, even without using his spiritual vision, the old man could easily guess what Ye Xiao had been up to.</p><p>And his appearance here now was also easy to explain.</p><p>Ye Xiao was using Professor Huang's borrowed library card, and Beitang Ce, with his identity, could easily find out Ye Xiao's identity and address by simply asking someone.</p><p>Now, carefully counting, there are already four people in this world who know his identity.</p><p>Or rather, it should be one person, one half-beast, and two fox spirits.</p><p></p><p>Ye Xiao nodded.</p><p>Seeing him acknowledge it, Beitang Ce couldn't help but sigh.</p><p></p><p>"The young are truly formidable! Mr. Ye, at just twenty years old, has already managed to slay a Saint Monarch-level star beast in such a short time. This skill, even if this old man cultivated for hundreds of years, would not dare to boast about being superior to Mr. Ye.</p><p>With Mr. Ye in this world, it can truly be said to be a blessing for the human race!"</p><p></p><p>Ye Xiao replied indifferently:</p><p></p><p>"Senior Beitang has also shed blood for the human race as a heroic figure, so don't put on such an official tone. Just be casual, I'm not used to chatting in that official manner."</p><p></p><p>Beitang Ce was taken aback for a moment, but then gained even more admiration for Ye Xiao.</p><p>His calm and natural temperament...</p><p></p><p>Here is the full English translation of the Chinese excerpt:</p><p></p><p>Unperturbed by praise or disgrace, how rare this is. No wonder he, at such a young age, has already reached a realm that others may not even attain in their entire lifetime.</p><p></p><p>"Mr. Ye, this old man has come to visit you today without prior notice. I hope you don't mind?" </p><p></p><p>Ye Xiao nodded.</p><p></p><p>"Then may I have a brief chat with you? I won't take up too much of your time."</p><p></p><p>Ye Xiao paused for a moment, then nodded again.</p><p></p><p>This old man had likely been waiting here for a while, and he himself also had some questions he wanted to ask Ye Xiao.</p><p></p><p>"Then shall we find a place to sit and talk?"</p><p></p><p>"No need, let's walk and talk."</p><p></p><p>"Alright then."</p><p></p><p>The old and the young began walking along the street.</p><p></p><p>North Tang Ce couldn't help but ask, "Mr. Ye, are you the Sword Saint of Jianghai City?"</p><p></p><p>"The Sword Saint is a title the people of Jianghai City have given me."</p><p></p><p>"Haha, the world has spread tales of your extraordinary skills, saying you have hair and beard as white as an immortal elder. If they knew you were just a young man in his twenties, I'm sure everyone would be utterly astonished."</p><p></p><p>"That's precisely why I've never publicly revealed my identity. I only wish to cultivate in peace, without being entangled too much with fame and profit. Now that Senior North Tang has recognized me, I hope he won't spread the word."</p><p></p><p>North Tang Ce nodded.</p><p></p><p>"Alright, I respect your choice. In fact, this is a rather good idea. To have broken through to the Ninth Realm of the Innate at just twenty years old, you can be considered the number one in the world today. Your resources should not be lacking.</p><p></p><p>However, the more you reach this stage, the more you need to calm your mind and try to break through. If you become tainted by fame and profit, won't it be easy to lose this precious state of mind?"</p><p></p><p>After a pause, he continued:</p><p></p><p>"May I ask, Mr. Ye, from whom did you learn? What exactly allowed you to cultivate to this level of ability? The master who taught you must be a great sage, no?"</p><p></p><p>Ye Xiao fell silent for a moment, then replied:</p><p></p><p>"Yes, my master is indeed a great sage, but he has long gone wandering the world. I'm not sure if he is still on this land or not."</p><p></p><p>Ye Xiao wanted to use North Tang Ce to resolve some of his own doubts, but he also had to be somewhat guarded. As the saying goes, "One cannot be without a heart of vigilance." He fabricated a master for himself, and North Tang Ce certainly wouldn't dare to have any ideas.</p><p></p><p>North Tang Ce sighed wistfully:</p><p></p><p>"I never imagined there would be such a great sage in this world. If I ever have the chance to meet him, that would truly be a blessing for me."</p><p></p><p>Ye Xiao caught the meaning behind his words and nodded.</p><p></p><p>"If there's an opportunity in the future, you will get to meet him."</p><p></p><p>Then North Tang Ce asked again, "I've noticed that you've been studying materials related to eye techniques, soul cultivation, and the Monarch Realm. Could it be that you're about to break through to the Monarch Realm?"</p><p></p><p>Ye Xiao shook his head.</p><p></p><p>"I haven't reached that level yet, but I need to prepare for it in advance."</p><p></p><p>"At your young age, you've already reached the Ninth Realm of the Innate. Any heaven-gifted talent, even with imperial bloodline, would be insignificant before you. You should have a great chance of breaking through to the Monarch Realm.</p><p></p><p>The reason I've come to find you today is not only to get to know you, but also to ask if there's anything I can help you with.</p><p></p><p>The situation in the Star Battlefield is becoming increasingly tense, and there's even a possibility of the strongest demonic calamity in thousands of years.</p><p></p><p>With your strength, you should be able to clearly see the situation. The human race now needs powerful combat prowess, especially those who have surpassed the Monarch Realm."</p><p></p><p>As a strong cultivator of the human race, North Tang Ce understood better than anyone what the human race needed at the moment.</p><p></p><p>So when he saw Ye Xiao, the first thing he wanted to do was to befriend him and do his utmost to help him.</p><p></p><p>Cultivating a powerful expert was of utmost importance for the survival of the entire human race.</p><p></p><p>"Aren't you afraid that I might turn out to be an ungrateful person after you've helped me?"</p><p></p><p>North Tang Ce smiled.</p><p></p><p>"Have you forgotten? I cultivate eye techniques. In terms of strength, I may not be as good as you, but when it comes to judging people, this old man still has a few tricks up his sleeve.</p><p></p><p>There's not a trace of evil intent on you.</p><p></p><p>And I've also been following the news about the Sword Saint of Jianghai City online. You've been silently guarding Jianghai City. A person like you, if I still can't trust, then my eyes must truly be blind."</p><p></p><p>In fact, under normal circumstances, he might have tested Ye Xiao more, but now he knew that the Star Battlefield couldn't wait, and the human race couldn't wait either.</p><p></p><p>Ye Xiao nodded.</p><p></p><p>"Senior North Tang's vision is indeed sharp. I'm impressed."</p><p></p><p>"I'm just a hero cherishing another hero."</p><p></p><p>"Then, may I ask if Senior North Tang can point me to a clue regarding breaking through to the Monarch Realm?"</p><p></p><p>"As for that, there is indeed a place."</p><p></p><p>North Tang Ce stopped in his tracks and looked into Ye Xiao's eyes, saying, "Mr. Ye, two hundred miles south of the Central State, there is a Warrior Immortal Cave. Inside, there is a Warrior Immortal Stele left behind by the Warrior Immortal Han Xin, rumored to contain the secrets to breaking through to the Monarch Realm."</p>

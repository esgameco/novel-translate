        <h1>Chapter 270</h1>
        <div class="content">
            <p>Here is the full English translation of the Chinese excerpt:</p><p></p><p>"Correct!" </p><p></p><p>Both Beitang Ce and Jiang Chen spoke at the same time.</p><p></p><p>However, Jiang Chen then spoke again:</p><p></p><p>"In fact, this is also a very risky thing. If it weren't for your display of strength today, you wouldn't be able to go to that place at all.</p><p></p><p>Since hundreds of years ago, when the dragon veins of the Nine Provinces were all severed, and the ancestor of the myriad dragons of Kunlun went into hiding, the entire land of the Nine Provinces has only this one living dragon vein left.</p><p></p><p>The others have lost their dragon qi and can no longer continue to grow.</p><p></p><p>So, the Nine Provinces are very strict in controlling the White Dragon Vein.</p><p></p><p>In addition to the four Venerable Ones taking turns guarding it, to enter it, one also needs one of the four Venerable Ones' tokens.</p><p></p><p>Otherwise, even if one is at the King Realm, they may not be able to enter.</p><p></p><p>Today, you will be the only one to enter in nearly fifty years."</p><p></p><p>"Was there someone who entered fifty years ago? Who was the other one who went in?"</p><p></p><p>Ye Xiao took a deep breath, his eyes revealing a hint of awe.</p><p></p><p>"The Sword Emperor, the Azure Dragon!"</p><p></p><p>Ye Xiao had already vaguely guessed that it was him.</p><p></p><p>As the number one figure in the Nine Provinces, ranked first in the World Dragon Ranking, the Azure Dragon was the most likely to have the qualifications to enter.</p><p></p><p>"By the way, you four Venerable Ones have all already become King Realm experts, why haven't you gone in?"</p><p></p><p>Ye Xiao felt a bit puzzled.</p><p></p><p>Jiang Chen shrugged helplessly.</p><p></p><p>"We are not qualified enough. In fact, the bloodlines of the four Venerable Ones are all imperial bloodlines, and we are all very strong existences.</p><p></p><p>But even with imperial bloodlines, our strength is still not enough.</p><p></p><p>The Azure Dragon had already stepped into the King Realm by the age of thirty, while we only broke through to the King Realm by relying on the enlightenment of the previous Venerable One."</p><p></p><p>Ye Xiao's eyes flickered slightly.</p><p></p><p>Unexpectedly, the Sword Emperor Azure Dragon was actually so powerful! To have broken through to the King Realm at the age of thirty, his natural talent was indeed quite remarkable.</p><p></p><p>The Illusory Jade in the courtyard couldn't help but roll her eyes.</p><p></p><p>Breaking through to the King Realm at the age of thirty, so what? The master of this household had only just broken through to the King Realm at the age of twenty-one, and he had only been cultivating for a little over a year, just reaching the early Ninth Grade of the Primal Realm a year ago. </p><p></p><p>The subsequent breakthroughs were so fast, it was clear that the earlier ones were even faster. Calculated this way, Ye Xiao had only taken a little over a year to break through from an ordinary person to the King Realm. </p><p></p><p>That was true genius! That Azure Dragon fellow wasn't even worthy of being his shoe-bearer.</p><p></p><p>Beitang Ce spoke up again:</p><p></p><p>"Venerable One, you should hurry up and hand the Xuanwu Token to Ye Xiao, so he can go to the White Dragon Vein as soon as possible and improve his cultivation, lest time drags on and dreams multiply."</p><p></p><p>"This..." </p><p></p><p>Jiang Chen suddenly became a bit hesitant.</p><p></p><p>Beitang Ce was taken aback.</p><p></p><p>"Venerable One, what's wrong?"</p><p></p><p>Jiang Chen took a deep breath, his face grave:</p><p></p><p>"It's not that I don't want to give it to you, but there are some special reasons I need to explain to you."</p><p></p><p>Ye Xiao nodded, and Jiang Chen waved his right hand, and an antique bronze Xuanwu Seal appeared in his palm.</p><p></p><p>Accompanying the appearance of the Xuanwu Seal was also a black wooden box, engraved with some strange and solemn patterns.</p><p></p><p>"The Xuanwu Seal is the key to opening the door to the Dragon Vein, and it also possesses tremendous power.</p><p></p><p>During the last beast calamity, I used it to seal an extremely evil King Realm spirit beast. Its strength was very powerful, and it took the joint effort of me and the Fire Phoenix Venerable One to finally capture it.</p><p></p><p>Afterwards, I sealed it in this small box and suppressed it with the Xuanwu Seal.</p><p></p><p>If I give you the Xuanwu Seal, there is a high chance that it will escape.</p><p></p><p>By myself, I can only hold it back for about a month at most. If you don't return within a month, there is a 90% chance that this King Realm spirit beast will escape.</p><p></p><p>When that happens, the entire Jianghai City may be devastated.</p><p></p><p>Do you have the confidence to return within a month?"</p><p></p><p>Ye Xiao nodded.</p><p></p><p>"The problem shouldn't be too big. I'll go directly using my movement technique."</p><p></p><p>"How fast is your movement technique?"</p><p></p><p>Ye Xiao was silent for a moment, then suddenly disappeared from the spot, and in no time, reappeared in front of the two.</p><p></p><p>He took out his phone and handed it to them.</p><p></p><p>The two looked at each other, and the corners of their mouths couldn't help but twitch violently.</p><p></p><p>"In that instant just now, did you take a photo of us at an altitude of tens of thousands of meters?"</p><p></p><p>Ye Xiao nodded, and added another sentence.</p><p></p><p>"To be precise, it was at an altitude of 100,000 meters."</p><p></p><p>Jiang Chen: "Fuck!"</p><p></p><p>Beitang Ce: "What the...?!"</p><p></p><p>"I'm starting to doubt whether you're even human."</p><p></p><p>Ye Xiao was a little speechless. In fact, he hadn't even fully unleashed his true strength.</p><p></p><p>And his movement technique was still a little short of being complete. Once it succeeded, he didn't know what kind of speed it would become.</p><p></p><p>The Xuanwu Venerable One told Ye Xiao some precautions, and then had Beitang Ce follow Ye Xiao.</p><p></p><p>Here is the full English translation of the Chinese excerpt:</p><p></p><p>Heading to the Long White Dragon Vein.</p><p></p><p>He then handed the Xuanwu Token to Ye Xiao.</p><p></p><p>"Ye Xiao, I have given you the Xuanwu Token. How far you can go from here is entirely up to your own destiny.</p><p></p><p>If you can become an Emperor Realm expert, it will not only be a personal honor for you, but also a blessing for our entire Jiuzhou human race.</p><p></p><p>Of course, it is also our hope!"</p><p></p><p>The heavy Xuanwu Token was handed to Ye Xiao, and he could feel the weight of the hope placed upon it.</p><p></p><p>The Venerable Xuanwu had placed the hope for Jiuzhou's future on his shoulders.</p><p></p><p>Ye Xiao nodded.</p><p></p><p>"Don't worry, even if it's just for my own sake, I will do my utmost to break through to the Emperor Realm."</p><p></p><p>The Venerable Xuanwu nodded.</p><p></p><p>But at this moment, a faint spiritual fluctuation began to emanate from the small box.</p><p></p><p>Although this spiritual fluctuation was very weak, it still did not escape Ye Xiao's perception.</p><p></p><p>Ye Xiao's perception was many times stronger than the Venerable Xuanwu's.</p><p></p><p>In the next moment, he directly unleashed the Taixuan Heavenly Might, instantly shattering that spiritual force into pieces.</p><p></p><p>Afterwards, he waved his hand and cast a Disha Heavenly Formation to seal the box.</p><p></p><p>By the time he finished, the Venerable Xuanwu finally noticed his movements, and a cold sweat broke out on his back.</p><p></p><p>"Damn it, I didn't expect this guy to be so cunning. I just gave you the Xuanwu Token, and he already wanted to escape from it.</p><p></p><p>But how did you detect his spiritual force? I couldn't even sense it."</p><p></p><p>Ye Xiao smiled slightly.</p><p></p><p>"I have a basic understanding of some spiritual cultivation techniques."</p><p></p><p>Jiang Chen's mouth couldn't help but twitch violently.</p><p></p><p>You call that a "basic understanding"?</p><p></p><p>If this is what he calls a "basic understanding", then what would he call his own inability to even sense the other's spiritual force?</p><p></p><p>Beitang Ce quietly spoke in his ear:</p><p></p><p>"Venerable, when Ye Xiao says he has a 'basic understanding', for us, it basically means he's extremely powerful. His 'basic understanding' may truly be just that, but you absolutely must not take him at face value."</p><p></p><p>The Venerable Xuanwu's mouth twitched again.</p><p></p><p>This guy, not only is his cultivation monstrous and incomprehensible, it turns out even his techniques are monstrous and incomprehensible.</p><p></p><p>He waved his hand.</p><p></p><p>"Alright, alright. You two don't need to keep chattering here. Just hurry up and get going. The sooner you can return, the better."</p><p></p><p>Ye Xiao spoke calmly:</p><p></p><p>"There shouldn't be any major problems. The formation I've inscribed on this box is an Emperor Realm defensive formation, as well as a containment formation. As long as his strength hasn't broken through to the Emperor Realm, there's basically no need to worry too much."</p><p></p><p>Jiang Chen: "(￢_￢)!"</p><p></p><p>"I know you're very powerful, but please don't keep provoking me, okay?"</p><p></p><p>Ye Xiao was silent for a moment, then nodded and grabbed Beitang Ce's shoulder, using his technique to teleport away.</p><p></p><p>Jiang Chen was so angry he puffed out his cheeks and glared.</p><p></p><p>"This brat! I already told him not to keep provoking me. He actually went and provoked me right in front of me again.</p><p></p><p>Unleashing such a fast movement technique, I couldn't even see his figure.</p><p></p><p>Was he deliberately trying to show off in front of this old man?"</p><p></p><p>In fact, Ye Xiao had no such intention.</p><p></p><p>He just wanted to hurry and find the dragon vein, obtain the dragon qi, and then return the Xuanwu Token.</p><p></p><p>Furthermore, Jiang Chen had already said not to provoke him, so the implication was for Ye Xiao to leave quickly, right? So why stay there?</p><p></p><p>Jiang Chen looked at the formation Ye Xiao had left on the box, pondering for a long time, and finally couldn't help but let out a deep sigh.</p><p></p><p>"Alas! It's really a case of one person being better than another, and it's enough to drive one crazy! I originally thought that little bastard Qinglong was already annoying enough. But now, another one even more annoying than him has appeared.</p><p></p><p>Just who gave birth to him? He's already monstrous enough on his own.</p><p></p><p>His parents must have been monstrous to an unimaginable degree to give birth to such a prodigy of a freak."</p><p></p><p>Shaking his head, Jiang Chen put away the small box and turned to head towards the library.</p><p></p><p>Meanwhile, from within the box, an angry roar echoed out.</p><p></p><p>"Damn it! I was so close, just a little bit more and I would have escaped! That damned human child actually mastered the Emperor Formations! Damn it! Don't let me see you again. If I ever encounter you again, I will tear you to pieces, grind your bones to dust, turn you into a spicy skewer, and roast you alive over the fire!</p><p></p><p>But just now, I've already released a strand of blood-killing aura from my consciousness. It will seek out a powerful expert with a strong blood-killing aura and activate their blood-killing power, helping me break through this barrier.</p><p></p><p>Wait and see, it won't be long.</p><p></p><p>It won't be long before I can break out of this damned box. Then I will regain my freedom and soar through the nine heavens, reveling in the fresh blood of the human race!"</p><p></p><p>Six updates, 18,000 words.</p><p></p><p>Please recommend, vote, and subscribe.</p><p></p><p>Thank you to the readers who have supported "It's Not My Fault I'm Not Popular" with donations, I'm deeply grateful.</p><p></p><p>I'm too tired tonight, so I may not be able to write more later. Please understand.</p><p></p><p>(Chapter end)</p>

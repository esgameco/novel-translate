        <h1>Chapter 385</h1>
        <div class="content">
            <p>Here is the full English translation of the Chinese excerpt:</p><p></p><p>"In my entire life, I have tasted countless teas, but I have never tasted anything like this before. In this world, only the Tomb of the Divine King could have produced such a divine elixir!"</p><p></p><p>The representatives all nodded in praise, and in an instant, countless warriors from various tribes cast envious glances.</p><p></p><p>It was decided that they must strive to cultivate and reach higher realms as soon as possible.</p><p></p><p>That way, in the future, if there were any other divine elixirs or the like, they could also partake in them.</p><p></p><p>The Divine Elixir Assembly lasted for more than an hour, and Zhu Chunqiu delivered a long string of official-sounding nonsense before it finally ended.</p><p></p><p>After the Divine Elixir Assembly concluded, everyone returned to their respective camps.</p><p></p><p>The representatives of the Thunder God Tribe, Tyr, the Wing God Tribe, Senna, and the Vajra God Tribe, Woody, gathered together.</p><p></p><p>As soon as the three entered the tent, Tyr picked up a bucket of water.</p><p></p><p>"Gulp, gulp, gulp, gulp." The other two couldn't help but be taken aback.</p><p></p><p>"Tyr, what are you doing? Why are you suddenly drinking so much water?"</p><p></p><p>Tyr's face was cold as ice. "You idiots! Didn't you feel it? That was not divine elixir at all, but fucking piss!"</p><p></p><p>"What did you say? How is that possible? That bottle was sealed with prohibitions by many representatives. How could he have done it?"</p><p></p><p>"How should I know how he did it? There are countless strange methods in this world. If there are ways to break the prohibitions, why is that surprising?"</p><p></p><p>"That bottle has been in his possession the whole time. Doing some little tricks, isn't that easy as pie?"</p><p></p><p>Woody slammed the table. "Damn it, I really thought that was divine elixir. Salty with a sweet aftertaste, a unique flavor. I never expected it to be piss, damn it."</p><p></p><p>Tyr: "(⊙.⊙)!"</p><p></p><p>Senna: "(⊙.⊙)!"</p><p></p><p>But after a moment, Woody couldn't help but ask curiously, "But even if it was just piss, how did you know? And why are you so sure, so certain?"</p><p></p><p>"Dumbass, of course it's because I've tasted it!"</p><p></p><p>Senna: "(_..)!"</p><p></p><p>Woody: "(_..)!"</p><p></p><p>Tyr was so angry he coughed up blood.</p><p></p><p>"You idiot! Can you ask some reliable questions? Is your focus really just on this?"</p><p></p><p>Woody cleared his throat. "Sorry, I was just curious. But speaking of which, if it was really just piss, why didn't the others notice? Why was it only you who discovered it? Is it just because you've tasted it before?"</p><p></p><p>"Stupid! Use your brain and think about it. In broad daylight, who dares to say they drank piss instead of divine elixir? All the representatives present were powerful experts from various tribes. If this got out, would they ever be able to show their faces again? Wouldn't they become the laughingstock of the world?"</p><p></p><p>"So many people must have realized it, but they didn't dare to say anything. They could only suppress their anger deep in their hearts."</p><p></p><p>"This damned Zhu Chunqiu, speaking so righteously. No wonder he was so generous in sharing the divine elixir with us! Damn it! He's played us, the divine elixir must have been hoarded by him alone."</p><p></p><p>"This wolf-hearted bastard! If we three great god tribes hadn't spread the news about the ancient divine tomb in the Canglan Star Domain, they wouldn't have known about it in the first place."</p><p></p><p>"Now he doesn't even show any gratitude, but instead makes us drink piss! I, Senna, swear that I will never become a divine emperor if I don't avenge this piss-drinking insult!"</p><p></p><p>Tyr: "?"</p><p></p><p>Woody: "?"</p><p></p><p>At this moment, the air distorted, and a round of applause reached their ears.</p><p></p><p>Clap, clap, clap. "You three heroes, seeking vengeance, that's truly admirable."</p><p></p><p>"Who is it?"</p><p></p><p>The three pupils contracted, and they instantly released their respective auras, their powerful pressures far exceeding the Seventh Realm of the Divine.</p><p></p><p>However, the other party remained completely unflustered, calmly smiling at the three.</p><p></p><p>"You three need not be so tense. I've come here only to disapprove of Zhu Chunqiu's actions and to help you deal with him."</p><p></p><p>"Who are you? We have no relation, why would you help us so generously?"</p><p></p><p>"That's natural. Even without any relation, as long as our interests align, we can become allies and forge a blood pact."</p><p></p><p>"Why should we trust you?"</p><p></p><p>"Because I have the ability to locate divine tombs, especially the good ones, like the Slaughter God Realm's ancient divine tomb, or even the Divine King Realm's ancient divine tomb."</p><p></p><p>The three pupils instantly contracted.</p><p></p><p>"Who are you exactly?"</p><p></p><p>"I'm just a wandering vagrant in the starry sky. You can call me... Blood Sovereign!"</p><p></p><p>A few days later, in the library, Ye Xiao was still reading books.</p><p></p><p>A figure silently approached the fourth floor and once again picked up the few books about the Sword Immortal Records.</p><p></p><p>After carefully reading them twice, he still found nothing, and couldn't help but sigh and shake his head.</p><p></p><p>He put the books back and, seeing Ye Xiao, suddenly spoke:</p><p></p><p>"You've been working in this library for a long time, haven't you?"</p><p></p><p>Ye Xiao nodded.</p><p></p><p>Here is my translation of the Chinese excerpt:</p><p></p><p>"Do you know? Before you came to Jianghai City, there was a martial artist called the Sword Immortal?"</p><p></p><p>Ye Xiao nodded again.</p><p></p><p>"Of course I know, most people in this world know about this. Those who don't know are probably from the Godly Tribes."</p><p></p><p>"Have you met the Sword Immortal?"</p><p></p><p>Ye Xiao shook his head.</p><p></p><p>"I'm just a small administrator, how could I possibly have met someone at that level of existence?"</p><p></p><p>"That's true."</p><p></p><p>The other person gave a bitter smile.</p><p></p><p>"You're just a small librarian, so what answers could I get from you?"</p><p></p><p>At this moment, the ring on his hand suddenly lit up.</p><p></p><p>"What's happening?"</p><p></p><p>He spoke towards the ring, and a woman's voice soon came through.</p><p></p><p>"Young master, the experts from the Ning family have arrived, and the other direct descendants of the Xuanyuan clan have also come."</p><p></p><p>"Understood, I'll head over there right away."</p><p></p><p>The light on the ring disappeared, and the man lightly stepped down, disappearing from the spot.</p><p></p><p>Ye Xiao shook his head and continued reading his book.</p><p></p><p>These people, they're almost going mad looking for him, why bother? Everyone should just live their own lives, minding their own business, wouldn't that be better?</p><p></p><p>Ning Zhiyuan quickly arrived in the starry sky.</p><p></p><p>In the starry sky, several massive spiritual energy ships had just arrived, even larger than the ones they had come in before.</p><p></p><p>Some of the spiritual energy ships were so massive that they could be compared to the size of a star island, reaching tens of thousands or even hundreds of thousands of meters in size.</p><p></p><p>Accompanying the arrival of these spiritual energy ships were the powerful experts of the previous generation from each family.</p><p></p><p>This group of experts were mostly at the Slay God Realm and beyond, with some even reaching the middle-to-late stages of the Slay God Realm.</p><p></p><p>The experts previously sent by the Xuanyuan Clan had a few Slay God Realm elites, but they were only a handful, just enough to hold the fort.</p><p></p><p>But now it's different.</p><p></p><p>Now, there are dozens of Slay God Realm experts! This terrifying number is enough to make one tremble in fear.</p><p></p><p>They are more than enough to sweep away the cultivators sent by the Hundred Clans.</p><p></p><p>This is the terrifying power of the Xuanyuan Clan - they can casually unleash a large group of extremely powerful experts.</p><p></p><p>And even this is not the true strength of the Xuanyuan Clan. The clan's true powerhouses have not even arrived yet.</p><p></p><p>The young masters of a few major clans, including Ning Zhiyuan, had to go up and pay their respects to these newcomers, who were mostly their uncles and a few even their grandfathers' generation.</p><p></p><p>After some polite exchanges, the starry sky once again stirred.</p><p></p><p>Soon, several even more massive spiritual energy ships, over 200,000 meters in size, slowly appeared before the crowd.</p><p></p><p>In addition to the "Xuanyuan" clan flag, the flags on these ships also bore the "Cloud" insignia.</p><p></p><p>Seeing this flag, the expressions of the crowd suddenly changed.</p><p></p><p>"This is...the Cloud family?"</p><p></p><p>"I didn't expect the Cloud family to come as well."</p><p></p><p>The next moment, several figures slowly flew out from the Xuanyuan-Cloud clan's spiritual energy ships. Leading them was an elder, who cupped his hands and smiled at the crowd: "Fellow daoists, the Cloud family has come uninvited, I hope you don't mind?"</p><p></p><p>The astonishment on everyone's faces quickly disappeared, replaced by smiles.</p><p></p><p>"Brother Cloud, don't be so polite. We are all from the Xuanyuan clan, of course we welcome Brother Cloud's arrival. But may I ask, why did you come at this time?"</p><p></p><p>"Hehe, of course it's for that peerless genius of our Xuanyuan clan." </p><p></p><p>The expressions of the crowd changed slightly. Indeed, that must be the reason.</p><p></p><p>Over the years, the Cloud family has been the strongest and purest-blooded branch within the Xuanyuan lineage, with the highest talent. The Cloud family has already cultivated several holy scions who have entered the Xuanyuan Mountain to learn the supreme martial arts of the Xuanyuan Clan.</p><p></p><p>Even in this generation, the Cloud family has produced a genius talent that could be considered a heaven-defying prodigy. </p><p></p><p>Normally, if nothing unexpected happened, this person would most likely become the next holy scion of the Xuanyuan Clan, enter the Xuanyuan Mountain, and cultivate the core martial arts of the Xuanyuan alongside the previous generation of experts, enjoying the most precious resources of the Xuanyuan Clan. In the future, they would have a high chance of becoming a God Emperor-level powerhouse!</p><p></p><p>But unexpectedly, in this human world, a talent has appeared that could surpass even the Cloud family's genius.</p><p></p><p>This is why the other major clans don't want the Cloud family to come - whoever can properly cultivate and nurture that peerless talent has the chance of making them the new number one of this generation in the Xuanyuan Clan, and the next holy scion. If they succeed in this, the Xuanyuan Mountain will surely bestow tremendous rewards and resources upon the clan that produced the new holy scion.</p><p></p><p>Those kinds of resources are something these clans can only dream of. The Cloud family has been able to maintain its hegemon status within the Xuanyuan Clan for so long precisely because they have cultivated several Xuanyuan holy scions over the years, receiving abundant rewards and resources from the Xuanyuan Mountain.</p><p></p><p>(Chapter end)</p>

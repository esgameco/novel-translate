        <h1>Chapter 345</h1>
        <div class="content">
            <p>Here is the full English translation of the Chinese excerpt:</p><p></p><p>The crowd couldn't help but swallow hard, a hint of fear flashing in their eyes.</p><p></p><p>"Do we still need to trouble that guy?"</p><p></p><p>After a moment of silence, Maicang spoke:</p><p></p><p>"As for my Yishen Clan, we will temporarily cease our attacks on him. As for the rest of you, do as you please."</p><p></p><p>With that, he stood up and left first.</p><p></p><p>The crowd fell silent.</p><p></p><p>Previously, it was Maicang, the leader of the Yishen Clan, whom they had cheered the most.</p><p></p><p>Now that even he said this, what else could the other clans say?</p><p></p><p>A wise man doesn't suffer losses in front of him! The other side's strength is so powerful, it's better to avoid their spearhead first.</p><p></p><p>Meanwhile, in the starry sky, a black-robed figure quietly arrived.</p><p></p><p>He stared at the human world below, a cold glint in his eyes.</p><p></p><p>"If it weren't for the fact that I'm not convenient to expose my identity right now, I would just go down and kill them all."</p><p></p><p>The jade spirit ring on his hand flashed with a green light.</p><p></p><p>"Don't be impulsive. Remember, your future is to become a God Emperor expert! Not to show off your courage for a moment."</p><p></p><p>"Don't worry, Master. I understand."</p><p></p><p>The jade spirit ring flashed green again.</p><p></p><p>"Let me use the Heavenly Passage Technique to take a look around and see if there's anything I can utilize."</p><p></p><p>After a moment, he spoke again:</p><p></p><p>"Found it! There's a relic site nearby. It should be a remnant of an Eradicate God Realm existence. Although it's not left behind by an absolute expert, it should be enough for them to fight over."</p><p></p><p>Pausing, he suddenly spoke again:</p><p></p><p>"Eh? There are also a few God Realm residences, strange, in such a remote place, there are actually quite a few God Realm fallen sites, which is quite interesting.</p><p></p><p>Too bad they're just God Realm, too trash, otherwise you could also go take a look."</p><p></p><p>The black-robed figure nodded.</p><p></p><p>"Next, just need to pass this information on to the God Clans in the human world, right?"</p><p></p><p>"Don't be too eager. First, pass it on to the Thunder God Clan, Yishen Clan, and Gigantic Ape God Clan. Let these three clans come and search first. To ensure they can smoothly obtain the relic site, they will definitely send even stronger existences.</p><p></p><p>Finally, tell the Xuanyuan God Clan, when they come to search, it will be the perfect time to stir up a conflict, and they will be at a disadvantage."</p><p></p><p>"Master's foresight is admirable, disciple is in awe."</p><p></p><p>The next moment, the jade ring flashed twice again.</p><p></p><p>"Hehe, it seems the divine blood from a small world has been collected. Go reap it first to supplement your Blood Slaughter Technique."</p><p></p><p>"Yes, Master!"</p><p></p><p>The black-robed figure released a few star beasts from the ring, threw out a few notes, and then turned and left.</p><p></p><p>On the shore, Maicang stood, clenching his fists as he gazed towards the Nine Provinces, his gaze filled with resentment.</p><p></p><p>Soon, a figure quietly arrived - it was Ates, the black-skinned leader of the Gigantic Ape God Clan.</p><p></p><p>He patted Maicang's shoulder and said, "Forget it! The Xuanyuan God Clan is, after all, the 19th ranked clan in the starry sky, we can never match them."</p><p></p><p>"Damn the Xuanyuan God Clan! If one day, the Yishen Clan also produces a top-tier expert, the first one I'll destroy will be the Xuanyuan God Clan!"</p><p></p><p>At this moment, a dragon's roar suddenly echoed from above the Eastern Nine Provinces.</p><p></p><p>Maicang couldn't help but shudder, the fear flashing in his eyes again as he recalled the terrifying scene earlier.</p><p></p><p>He swallowed hard, his face slightly flushed.</p><p></p><p>But just then, a fierce bird swooped down from the sky, dropping a pungent "bomb" right in front of him.</p><p></p><p>This scene only further enraged the already agitated Maicang.</p><p></p><p>"Vile beast! If I can't deal with the Xuanyuan God Clan, do you think I can't deal with you? Come down here!"</p><p></p><p>He raised his hand and slashed out with a sword, and the next moment, the star beast plummeted, crashing to the ground in front of the two.</p><p></p><p>A satisfied smile appeared on Maicang's lips.</p><p></p><p>But Ates walked over, puzzled.</p><p></p><p>"Strange, what is the star beast holding in its mouth?"</p><p></p><p>He went forward and took out the note from the star beast's mouth, and his expression immediately changed.</p><p></p><p>"Maicang, come take a look at this. What is this?"</p><p></p><p>Maicang walked over and took the note, his expression also changing.</p><p></p><p>"This is actually a transmission note from the Xuanyuan God Clan. This star beast is their messenger beast. They have discovered the relic of an Eradicate God Realm expert in the starry sky."</p><p></p><p>But in the blink of an eye, the two exchanged a delighted look.</p><p></p><p>"This is heaven-sent. I was just wondering how to vent my anger. Looks like the opportunity has arrived."</p><p></p><p>"Summon our clan's experts to seize the relic the Xuanyuan God Clan has discovered. That will be a way to retaliate against the Xuanyuan God Clan."</p><p></p><p>"And we can also obtain the inheritance of the Eradicate God Realm expert. A win-win!"</p><p></p><p>In the blink of an eye, a night had passed.</p><p></p><p>The next morning, Ye Xiao was on his way to work as usual.</p><p></p><p>Here is the full English translation of the Chinese excerpt:</p><p></p><p>The library dismissed him.</p><p></p><p>Ye Xiao felt even more lonely.</p><p></p><p>However, he was not used to being with too many people in the first place, and quietly reading books was the best treatment for him.</p><p></p><p>While he was reading, a surprised voice came from the other side.</p><p></p><p>"Madam Librarian, why are you here?"</p><p></p><p>Ye Xiao glanced at the other person, who was the new librarian Yao Meiqi. She was walking around the library with her hands behind her back, as if searching for something.</p><p></p><p>"I came down to take a look. Although these cultivation techniques are not very important to the Shenmu Academy, they were painstakingly compiled by the teachers of Shenmu Academy.</p><p></p><p>You must be careful and not lend them to anyone outside the regulations."</p><p></p><p>"Yes!"</p><p></p><p>Everyone responded in unison. Ye Xiao could feel that Yao Meiqi had released her spiritual awareness and was searching the fourth floor of the library.</p><p></p><p>Unfortunately, her strength was really too weak.</p><p></p><p>So, she was unable to detect Ye Xiao's abnormality.</p><p></p><p>After searching several times, she confirmed that there was nothing on the fourth floor that she was looking for, and then turned to the few management staff who had greeted her and said:</p><p></p><p>"Keep up the good work! I'll go downstairs and take a look."</p><p></p><p>"Yes, farewell Madam Librarian."</p><p></p><p>Yao Meiqi nodded and walked downstairs step by step. As she descended, her chest heaved continuously, causing the two male managers to tilt their heads and stare at her intently.</p><p></p><p>The female manager next to them elbowed them.</p><p></p><p>"Still looking? Be careful or your eyeballs will be gouged out. That's an Empyrean expert, and you two are only at the initial Xiantian Patriarch realm. How dare you have any improper thoughts about the Madam Librarian?"</p><p></p><p>The two male managers laughed awkwardly.</p><p></p><p>Ye Xiao was reading the book the whole time, with no particular expression on his face.</p><p></p><p>That Winged Deity Clan member died here, so it was normal for Yao Meiqi to come and investigate.</p><p></p><p>It seems that Shenmu Academy also pays attention to the existence of the Sword Immortal.</p><p></p><p>However, before his strength is further improved, Ye Xiao will not casually reveal his own identity.</p><p></p><p>Not to mention becoming a Divine Emperor, he must at least reach the Divine King realm.</p><p></p><p>Among the Divine Clans, there are many experts. Without enough protective strength, there will not be enough discourse power.</p><p></p><p>Unfortunately, although his cultivation has reached the Empyrean Realm of One Hundred and Eight Dragons, there is no sign of becoming a Divine Being.</p><p></p><p>Ye Xiao estimated that this was most likely because he had never encountered a Divine Realm expert before, and had not received such a heritage.</p><p></p><p>Just like when he broke through to the Empyrean Realm, he at least needed to give himself a little enlightenment, even if it was just to let himself see a Divine Realm expert.</p><p></p><p>Let his mind have a little bit of this kind of impression, so that he can have a better breakthrough direction.</p><p></p><p>It's just like if you don't climb to the top of the mountain, you'll never have the feeling of overlooking all the mountains.</p><p></p><p>But where can he find this kind of heritage? And it must be obtained without others knowing, which is even more difficult.</p><p></p><p>Ye Xiao shook his head and continued reading.</p><p></p><p>Fortunately, his luck was still not bad. He actually found an Empyrean-level alchemy technique, and it could even be recorded into the Golden Book of the Divine Soul.</p><p></p><p>Previously, he already had the Myriad Elements Return to One and the Crazy Thunder Tempering Pill Technique. Now, with the addition of this one, he could perfectly combine a brand new Divine Technique-level alchemy technique.</p><p></p><p>Coincidentally, he had previously collected many star cores, including the star core of the Super Divine Beast Lin Qingbei, and was planning to refine them into medicinal pills, but he had been lacking a Divine Technique-level alchemy technique.</p><p></p><p>Now he can make up for it.</p><p></p><p>Perfect!</p><p></p><p>Duang~!</p><p></p><p>The sound of the off-work bell rang, and Ye Xiao went back to have dinner.</p><p></p><p>On the other side, in the Silver Fox Valley, Ning Yuhen was reading an ancient book of the Silver Fox Clan.</p><p></p><p>The Silver Fox Clan has existed in the starry sky for a very long time, even far exceeding the XuanYuan Human Clan on the ground.</p><p></p><p>So many of the ancient books of the Silver Fox Clan recorded things that were even more than the human clans on the ground.</p><p></p><p>Ning Yuhen saw one article and couldn't help but be a little surprised.</p><p></p><p>"It turns out that in the ancient times, this star domain was also extremely prosperous! Not as desolate as it is now. There were even prosperous divine clans and Divine Emperor experts! Whew! That's too terrifying!"</p><p></p><p>He couldn't help but sigh, but after sighing, he couldn't help but lament the ruthlessness of time.</p><p></p><p>Even with the existence of experts like Divine Emperors, they will eventually dissipate in the long river of time.</p><p></p><p>Not to mention ordinary people like them.</p><p></p><p>"I don't know what realm I can cultivate to in this life? Can I always follow the Master?"</p><p></p><p>After all, the Master is so talented and monstrous in aptitude.</p><p></p><p>This made Ning Yuhen couldn't help but feel a little sad.</p><p></p><p>Making one's own strength stronger is not only completely out of the desire to protect oneself, but also to make one's life last longer, so that one can live happily with one's family and friends forever.</p><p></p><p>One update, three thousand words.</p><p></p><p>Please recommend and vote for monthly tickets.</p><p></p><p>Thank you to the reader Haidi Wusiji for the reward, I am very grateful.</p><p></p><p>(This chapter is complete)</p>

        <h1>Chapter 98</h1>
        <div class="content">
            <p>Here is the full English translation of the Chinese excerpt:</p><p></p><p>At this moment, she can be said to be the most dazzling star on the entire stage.</p><p></p><p>It can be foreseen that by defeating Sasaki Taro, her fame will directly overshadow Park Jian-sheng and become renowned throughout the Nine Prefectures.</p><p></p><p>The only one who is unhappy at this moment is Sasaki Taro.</p><p></p><p>He lost! This was the first stop of his challenge in the Nine Prefectures.</p><p></p><p>The first stop, and he was defeated, how can he continue on from here?</p><p></p><p>No matter how many matches and how many people he wins against, this fact cannot be changed.</p><p></p><p>It can be said that his plan to come to the Nine Prefectures has completely failed.</p><p></p><p>He is the renowned sword technique genius from Yingzhou, the master of the Iga ninjutsu, and the disciple of the Murakami lineage.</p><p></p><p>When he came to challenge the Nine Prefectures, the entire Yingzhou was promoting him, and he even obtained many resources because of this.</p><p></p><p>If he just goes back like this, his life is over.</p><p></p><p>According to the rules of Yingzhou, even if his master does not order him to commit seppuku, the spittle of the Yingzhou islanders alone can drown him.</p><p></p><p>He absolutely cannot go back like this.</p><p></p><p>If he brings back this humiliation, even his own family may be implicated.</p><p></p><p>A sense of humiliation, anger, and fear surged in his heart, and the murderous intent was spreading, making his eyes turn bloodshot.</p><p></p><p>He has not admitted defeat yet, which means the match is not over, and he can still make a move.</p><p></p><p>If the restriction on his cultivation is lifted, with his innate ninth-grade strength, he will definitely surpass Qin Yuyan's innate eighth-grade strength.</p><p></p><p>At this point, he can only resort to the ultimate sacrifice.</p><p></p><p>Kill Qin Yuyan!</p><p></p><p>At least severely injure her meridians, causing the downfall of a genius in the Nine Prefectures! He can completely claim that he was too angry, lost his rationality, and his emotions were out of control, and it was not intentional murder.</p><p></p><p>The great nation of the Nine Prefectures has always emphasized benevolence and righteousness. Since he injured someone in a match, and not on the street, there is a high chance that he will not be directly executed, but rather arrested and put on trial. At that time, Yingzhou will negotiate, and if the situation is good, there may even be an extradition.</p><p></p><p>Because he killed Qin Yuyan, the Yingzhou islanders will definitely support him, not shun him.</p><p></p><p>If he can return to Yingzhou, he will actually gain tremendous benefits.</p><p></p><p>At this moment, Sasaki Taro instantly came up with a plan that would be most beneficial to himself, a plan to resolve the huge humiliation of his failed challenge.</p><p></p><p>Gamble it all! "Die!"</p><p></p><p>After figuring out the plan, he did not hesitate at all, directly unleashing his full cultivation and rushing towards Qin Yuyan.</p><p></p><p>With his cultivation fully unleashed, his speed is more than twice as fast as before.</p><p></p><p>The innate ninth-grade, which is already close to the Transcendent Master level, and he cultivates the renowned Iga ninjutsu, which is known for its speed.</p><p></p><p>So his speed is extremely fast.</p><p></p><p>The people in the stands, such as Dou Changfeng, immediately noticed his intention.</p><p></p><p>"Outrageous, how dare you!" Dou Changfeng roared, activating his martial arts to rush towards Sasaki Taro.</p><p></p><p>However, as soon as he activated the spiritual energy in his body, the injury inflicted by Youwei started to recur, and the pain and tearing sensation in his meridians caused his movements to freeze instantly.</p><p></p><p>Qin Shenglong and the others, being only at the Mastery Realm, were not much faster than Sasaki Taro, and could not catch up in time.</p><p></p><p>Qin Yuyan never expected Sasaki Taro to be so shameless. Caught off guard, she hurriedly mobilized the spiritual energy in her body, but the opponent struck first, and in an instant, he was already in front of her. Even if she managed to activate her spiritual energy, it would be too late to make a move.</p><p></p><p>Success!</p><p></p><p>A smug arc appeared on the corners of Sasaki Taro's mouth.</p><p></p><p>Killing Qin Yuyan and destroying the super genius of the Nine Prefectures would definitely be a great achievement.</p><p></p><p>Here is the full English translation of the Chinese excerpt:</p><p></p><p>A feat was accomplished.</p><p></p><p>It was enough to make up for the failure of his own challenge. <div class="contentadv"><script>loadAdv(7,3);</script></div>However, just as it was a critical moment, everyone thought that Qin Yuyan was doomed to die. Suddenly, a flash of a blade shot out from between Qin Yuyan's eyebrows, radiating a hundred-meter blade beam, and it came crashing down.</p><p></p><p>Boom! After a violent explosion, Sasaki Taro was directly split in half from the middle, and a huge gully was also split in the floor of the venue.</p><p></p><p>The entire venue fell into deathly silence again.</p><p></p><p>Qin Shenglong and the others were stunned, staring blankly.</p><p></p><p>That senior's sword intent, when sensing the crisis moment, could actually be released on its own to fight the enemy?</p><p></p><p>Incredible!</p><p></p><p>Just how strong was that senior? On Ye Xiao's side, through constant study, he finally found the last book of the forging cultivation method.</p><p></p><p>After inputting it into the golden book, as long as he completed the cultivation, he could fuse it.</p><p></p><p>The few warriors over there also started discussing Qin Yuyan's showdown.</p><p></p><p>Without a doubt, Qin Yuyan had won.</p><p></p><p>However, what he didn't expect was that Sasaki Taro couldn't accept the loss and played dirty.</p><p></p><p>Fortunately, his own sword intent had slain him, otherwise the people of the Nine Provinces would have been injured by the demons of the Yingzhou Island.</p><p></p><p>The Ye Xiao of the previous life hated that little brat the most, and this time, could it be considered as indirectly resisting the island? Thinking about it, it felt quite comfortable.</p><p></p><p>"Duang~!"</p><p></p><p>The closing bell of the library rang, and Ye Xiao closed the book and prepared to go home. As he passed by the main entrance, ready to clock out, a faint fragrance wafted into his nose.</p><p></p><p>He turned his head and glanced, directly meeting Wang Jie's gaze.</p><p></p><p>"What a coincidence?"</p><p></p><p>Ye Xiao extended his index finger to clock out, and Wang Jie also clocked out.</p><p></p><p>"It's quite a coincidence. I haven't seen you in a while, what have you been up to?"</p><p></p><p>"I've been reading books upstairs recently."</p><p></p><p>"Still reading books? You should find a girlfriend. Do you want me to introduce one to you? Don't worry, I'll introduce you to a proper lady, not some shady girl."</p><p></p><p>"Thank you, but I'm not interested in a relationship for now."</p><p></p><p>"Alright then, I'm going home first. By the way, I'm getting married in a few days, don't forget to come and have a celebratory drink."</p><p></p><p>With that, there was a middle-aged man on an electric scooter outside calling out to Wang Jie. Wang Jie waved to Ye Xiao and quickly ran towards the man, getting on his electric scooter.</p><p></p><p>The man had a simple, honest appearance and was dressed plainly without any fancy attire.</p><p></p><p>He was a straightforward person.</p><p></p><p>The standard "taking over" type.</p><p></p><p>Wang Jie's attire was more formal, without the previous air of worldliness, and her makeup was only light. Her speech was also no longer as frivolous.</p><p></p><p>It seems that Ye Xiao's words had brought about some changes in Wang Jie, and she was ready to start a new life.</p><p></p><p>This gave Ye Xiao a sense of accomplishment. There's a saying that goes, "The two most difficult things in the world are putting other people's money in your own pocket and putting your own thoughts in other people's heads."</p><p></p><p>Saving a fallen soul seems to bring a greater sense of achievement than refining a powerful cultivation method.</p><p></p><p>However, Ye Xiao felt that the middle-aged man was rather pitiful.</p><p></p><p>But in the affairs of the world, as long as the parties involved are willing, it's none of Ye Xiao's business.</p><p></p><p>As long as they are happy, that's all that matters.</p><p></p><p>One update.</p><p></p><p>Thank you to the readers Ping'an, 20190824201941245, Five Kilometers Cool Me, and Ge Just a Passer-by999 for your donations, greatly appreciated.</p><p></p><p>(This chapter is complete)</p>

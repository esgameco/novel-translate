        <h1>Chapter 217</h1>
        <div class="content">
            <p>Here is the full English translation of the Chinese excerpt:</p><p></p><p>The librarian's words did not really interest Ye Xiao that much.</p><p></p><p>What he wanted to do the most was read books and improve his cultivation. Apart from that, he was not interested in other worldly matters, except for good food.</p><p></p><p>The identity of a librarian was just a mask he used to cover up his true self, and also to allow him to read books more easily in the library.</p><p></p><p>As for getting a promotion and a raise, he would be willing to do nothing and still get it.</p><p></p><p>But if he had to go out for training, that would not work.</p><p></p><p>It would waste too much time.</p><p></p><p>"How long does the outside training take?"</p><p></p><p>"It's about a month or so. The time is not too long. And the library in Zhongzhou is also very large, with quite advanced management methods.</p><p></p><p>I think you should go there and take a look, broaden your horizons and improve your abilities."</p><p></p><p>When Ye Xiao heard this, his eyes suddenly lit up.</p><p></p><p>Not for any other reason, but just for what the librarian had just said - the Zhongzhou library.</p><p></p><p>As the economic and cultural center of the entire Zhongzhou region, the scale of the city far exceeds that of Jianghai City. Even if Jianghai City will be expanded in the future, it has not yet reached this level.</p><p></p><p>So he really should go out and take a look.</p><p></p><p>Maybe he can even grasp some good cultivation methods and martial arts knowledge that he has not understood before.</p><p></p><p>Thinking about this, he nodded in agreement.</p><p></p><p>"Okay, I'll listen to the librarian. I'll go back and tell Yang Qian, let her work hard these days and manage the area by herself."</p><p></p><p>"No need, I've signed her up too. She's my niece. I just want to take this opportunity to train her. When the time comes, you can help take care of her a bit."</p><p></p><p>Ye Xiao: "(_..)!"</p><p></p><p>"But what about my area? Originally, it was just me and Yang Qian. Now that she's gone too."</p><p></p><p>"You don't need to worry about this. I've already thought about it. I'll let Liu Chengxun from the neighboring area come over to help you. Just go tell him, say it's what I said.</p><p></p><p>His area currently still has two administrators."</p><p></p><p>"Okay, I understand."</p><p></p><p>Ouyang Yunzhong nodded in satisfaction, then her expression became serious again.</p><p></p><p>"After you all come back from the training, the library should also have been expanded.</p><p></p><p>There will be a lot of new books added.</p><p></p><p>A new librarian should also come.</p><p></p><p>In the past, if you made some small mistakes, I could still protect you. But in the future, you'll have to be very strict and proper.</p><p></p><p>In short, do a good job, and your future position won't be low."</p><p></p><p>Ye Xiao nodded in response.</p><p></p><p>"Okay, let's do it that way. I'll put your name on the list later, you get ready, you should be leaving the day after tomorrow."</p><p></p><p>"Alright."</p><p></p><p>After leaving the librarian's office, Ye Xiao came to his own area. Yang Qian had not yet returned, she was called into the librarian's office after him, maybe there was something she needed to be instructed about.</p><p></p><p>Taking advantage of this moment when no one was around, Ye Xiao first went to the neighboring area to find Liu Chengxun.</p><p></p><p>As soon as he arrived, he saw Liu Chengxun staring blankly at a pile of broken iron on the table, his expression tinged with nostalgia, obviously feeling some distress.</p><p></p><p>Just as he was about to speak, Park Jiansheng, who was reading a book nearby, made a gesture to keep quiet, then whispered:</p><p></p><p>"Mr. Ye, don't disturb my master, let him be alone for a while!"</p><p></p><p>Ye Xiao seemed to have thought of something, and nodded.</p><p></p><p>Park Jiansheng explained:</p><p></p><p>"That sword was left to my master by my grandmaster. It can be said to be an ancestral treasure of our sect. But last time, when the Beast God Alliance's leader Long Tu came, he destroyed it. So my master has been feeling guilty about it lately, often staring at this pile of broken swords in a daze."</p><p></p><p>"I see."</p><p></p><p>No wonder Liu Chengxun would be so sentimental. But he had destroyed the sword to help Jianghai City, and he had even risked his life. Publicly and privately, Ye Xiao should lend a hand.</p><p></p><p>Thinking about this, he walked up to him.</p><p></p><p>"Old Liu."</p><p></p><p>Liu Chengxun came to his senses and looked at him.</p><p></p><p>"It's you, Ye Xiao. What's the matter?"</p><p></p><p>"The librarian wants me to go out for a month of training, and Yang Qian is also going, so there won't be anyone to help me manage my area for this month. The librarian asked me to come find you, hoping you could spare one of your subordinates to help me take care of it."</p><p></p><p>Liu Chengxun nodded.</p><p></p><p>"No problem. I'll go tell them later and arrange for someone to go over there."</p><p></p><p>"Thank you."</p><p></p><p>"You're welcome."</p><p></p><p>After a pause, Ye Xiao spoke again:</p><p></p><p>"Your sword is broken, aren't you going to get someone to repair it?"</p><p></p><p>Liu Chengxun shook his head.</p><p></p><p>"It's not easy to find someone. This sword has already reached the level of an imperial weapon. Only a blacksmith of extremely high skill would be able to repair it.</p><p></p><p>Even the most skilled blacksmiths may not necessarily be able to fix it.</p><p></p><p>I plan to go back to Hanzhou later and find a few of the top-tier blacksmiths there to work together and try to repair it."</p><p></p><p>Here is the full English translation of the Chinese excerpt:</p><p></p><p>"The best!"</p><p></p><p>"That's true. But the top-tier alchemists in the Nine Provinces are not easy to find. </p><p></p><p>They are either in high positions or hidden among the common people."</p><p></p><p>"I've studied alchemy before and have communicated with some alchemy merchants. A friend of mine seems to know an extremely powerful alchemy master.</p><p></p><p>If you don't mind, you can give me these fragments, and I can take them to him to see if he can reforge them for you?"</p><p></p><p>Liu Chengxun's eyes lit up.</p><p></p><p>"Are you serious? Can you take me there in person? I'll pay a hefty price to increase the chances of success."</p><p></p><p>Ye Xiao was amused and perplexed. How could he take you there? That "alchemy master" was just him.</p><p></p><p>"I'm afraid that won't work. He is very reclusive and lives in seclusion in the mountains. He doesn't like to interact with strangers. </p><p></p><p>If I casually bring an unfamiliar person to him, there's a high chance he'll get angry and refuse to help."</p><p></p><p>Liu Chengxun was deflated, but he also understood and nodded.</p><p></p><p>"You're right. Those reclusive and extraordinary people have their own unique habits and temperaments."</p><p></p><p>He handed the fragments to Ye Xiao.</p><p></p><p>"Then I'll leave it to you."</p><p></p><p>Ye Xiao nodded.</p><p></p><p>"Don't worry, I'll do my best to help you resolve this matter."</p><p></p><p>After a brief chat, Ye Xiao returned to his own area and continued reading.</p><p></p><p>He already had many martial arts combat techniques, and the only one left in his plan was the leg technique.</p><p></p><p>The other techniques had already been combined into imperial arts, which could not be further combined.</p><p></p><p>Learning the leg technique was because the legs are the strongest attack method in the human body.</p><p></p><p>However, he was not looking at the leg technique now, but rather the soul refining technique.</p><p></p><p>After all, his cultivation speed was very fast, and he had a good chance of breaking through to the King Realm within half a year! If he were to lose control and go into demonic cultivation at that time, it would be a big problem.</p><p></p><p>Ye Xiao found from the books that soul refining techniques were extremely rare, and even if there were any, they were either very poor or extremely powerful but difficult to obtain.</p><p></p><p>Because only spiritual cultivators who cultivate mental techniques would practice soul refining, and this group of people was very small.</p><p></p><p>This indirectly led to the scarcity of soul refining techniques.</p><p></p><p>The top-tier soul refining techniques were created because warriors who had broken through to the Innate Ninth Rank had to refine their souls, so they emerged.</p><p></p><p>However, their numbers were even fewer, and they were only mastered by a few extraordinary experts, making them extremely difficult to reach.</p><p></p><p>In a place like Jianghai City, the soul refining techniques currently recorded in the martial arts library were only a few.</p><p></p><p>Ye Xiao spent a whole day and only found about fifteen soul refining techniques, and he could only extract one of them.</p><p></p><p>"I wonder if the martial arts library in Zhongzhou has any soul refining techniques? If there are, it would be a good opportunity for me.</p><p></p><p>But there's no need to worry too much.</p><p></p><p>The martial arts library in Jianghai City should have been expanded by the time I return.</p><p></p><p>I'm sure there will be many excellent techniques there, including some soul refining techniques."</p><p></p><p>The sound of the bell signaling the end of the workday rang, and Ye Xiao got up and prepared to go back to tidy up his clothes and make arrangements for Xuanliuli to stay well in Jianghai City and collect the profits from the farm every day.</p><p></p><p>This made Ye Xiao feel like he was back in his previous life, tending a QQ farm and harvesting crops every day.</p><p></p><p>At least no one would steal his crops, which was quite comfortable.</p><p></p><p>"It's off work, and there's a new spicy squid skewer shop opened in the north of the city. Let's go try it."</p><p></p><p>The cool autumn night came quickly. In the blink of an eye, the sun had set.</p><p></p><p>At this time, a burly figure with a thick beard also arrived in Jianghai City.</p><p></p><p>He wore a large windbreaker, his thick beard very prominent, and an inexplicable aura emanating from him, making people not dare to approach him, feeling a sense of fear.</p><p></p><p>It was Noel Fei!</p><p></p><p>Looking at the human beings on the street, he licked his lips, and his eyes emitted a faint green glow.</p><p></p><p>"It's been a long time since I've eaten human beings, I really miss it."</p><p></p><p>However, he soon spoke again:</p><p></p><p>"No need to hurry, just wait a while. As long as I find my separated body and fuse it back, I'll then slaughter this city!</p><p></p><p>If I act now, I might alert some powerful human experts and ruin my plan to recover my main body, that would be a big loss."</p><p></p><p>Thinking of this, he strode into the northern district of Jianghai City.</p><p></p><p>There were many human beings on the street, which made Noel Fei salivate while also sighing inwardly.</p><p></p><p>There was a reason why the human race could develop, after all.</p>

        <h1>Chapter 257</h1>
        <div class="content">
            <p>Here is the full English translation of the Chinese excerpt:</p><p></p><p>On Ye Xiao's side, there was not much commotion.</p><p></p><p>Qing Niu and Feng Long, when they had just arrived, he had already sensed their presence.</p><p></p><p>His current strength was at the King Realm level, and with just a single thought, he could easily cover the entire Jianghai City.</p><p></p><p>In the past, he could also instantly cover the entire Jianghai City, but at that time, Jianghai City had not yet expanded.</p><p></p><p>Now, Jianghai City was about five times larger than before.</p><p></p><p>Moreover, a large number of people had flooded in.</p><p></p><p>The surrounding several cities, like Wanghai and Jiangdong, had all migrated their populations here.</p><p></p><p>For him to cover the entire Jianghai City with just a single thought now, was not the same as before when he could cover the original Jianghai City.</p><p></p><p>It was precisely because of this that he had long known that Jiang Chen, the dean, would make a move.</p><p></p><p>He could even see it as if it were right in front of him.</p><p></p><p>Anything that happened in any corner of Jianghai City could not escape his eyes.</p><p></p><p>It would not be an exaggeration to say that as long as he wanted to know, he could instantly know what every single person in Jianghai City was doing at any given moment.</p><p></p><p>Therefore, he did not intervene.</p><p></p><p>Later, although Jiang Chen was a bit casual and did not attack with full force, causing Feng Long to escape by using the Blood Explosion Technique, and Qing Niu to betray Feng Long and flee, Ye Xiao did not stop them.</p><p></p><p>Because he could also monitor that Feng Long had entered his breeding ground, and as long as he entered the breeding ground, no matter how powerful he was, he would not be able to escape from it.</p><p></p><p>The defensive formation he had set up was one-way, not two-way, otherwise it would completely isolate the spiritual energy.</p><p></p><p>The formation needed to constantly absorb spiritual energy to function.</p><p></p><p>The principle of the Blood Explosion Technique was probably to transform one's own body elements into a substance similar to spiritual energy, and then escape.</p><p></p><p>That was why Feng Long accidentally stumbled into the breeding ground.</p><p></p><p>But since the defensive formation was one-way, and it was to prevent the star beasts inside from escaping, when Feng Long tried to use the Blood Explosion Technique again, he naturally could not escape.</p><p></p><p>As for Qing Niu, it was even simpler.</p><p></p><p>Ye Xiao had already sensed that the path of Qing Niu's escape was blocked by Dao Shen Li Liushui.</p><p></p><p>As long as Li Liushui was guarding there, unless Qing Niu's strength had reached the true Deity Beast realm, he would not be able to defeat Li Liushui and escape.</p><p></p><p>At this moment, Huan Liuli suddenly opened the door, excitedly shouting, "Master, master, come and take a look. I've got something good! A star beast at the God Ancestor level, and it's a bull! Haha, from now on we can have beef, we can have hot pot, and we can even have steak!"</p><p></p><p>Huan Liuli excitedly brought the unconscious Qing Niu in front of Ye Xiao.</p><p></p><p>Ye Xiao looked at the muscular bull in front of him and nodded in satisfaction.</p><p></p><p>In fact, he had encountered a Qing Niu before, the Thunder Qing Niu at the bottom of the Tiemo Cliff.</p><p></p><p>However, that Qing Niu was not as powerful as the one in front of him now.</p><p></p><p>Moreover, that Qing Niu had been corroded by the evil energy at the Tiemo Cliff, and could no longer be used for meat.</p><p></p><p>Ye Xiao had only been able to refine it into a medicinal pill at the time.</p><p></p><p>Now he had harvested another Qing Niu! And its strength was even greater than the previous one, truly an unexpected and pleasant surprise.</p><p></p><p>"You've done well."</p><p></p><p>"Thank you, master, meow~!" Huan Liuli was extremely excited, her little tail wagging rapidly.</p><p></p><p>"I'll go and put him in the breeding ground and lock him up. You can take a break from the breeding ground today."</p><p></p><p>"Okay, master."</p><p></p><p>Ye Xiao nodded, patted her little head, and then, holding the Qing Niu, used the Earth Traversal Technique to instantly arrive at the breeding ground.</p><p></p><p>Huan Liuli's little head was burning with excitement.</p><p></p><p>Ah, ah, ah, the master just now, patted her little head.</p><p></p><p>Ah, ah, ah, it felt so good!</p><p></p><p>Ye Xiao didn't think much of it, he just casually stroked the little head like one would normally do to a pet.</p><p></p><p>At this moment, he suddenly appeared in the breeding ground.</p><p></p><p>The next second, the star beasts quickly gathered around him.</p><p></p><p>"Master, you're here."</p><p>"Master, did you have a good day?"</p><p>"Master, are you thirsty? The fresh milk we just milked is still warm."</p><p></p><p>Seeing the star beasts acting like loyal dogs, Feng Long was completely dumbfounded.</p><p></p><p>What was this situation? What were these creatures doing? Didn't they have any self-respect at all? They were all star beasts, and even God Ancestor level ones!</p><p></p><p>Such powerful star beasts, actually acting like a bunch of loyal dogs, licking a human? If their ancestors saw this, they would probably crawl out of their graves and scold them furiously!</p><p></p><p>But this person was not the one who had defeated him! Who was he?</p><p></p><p>With these doubts in mind, Feng Long coldly said, "Hey, who are you?"</p><p></p><p>Ye Xiao glanced at him and threw the Qing Niu next to him.</p><p></p><p>"Damn it, this bastard!" </p><p></p><p>Seeing the Qing Niu, Feng Long was so angry that he almost vomited blood.</p><p></p><p>If it wasn't for this idiot suddenly attacking him from behind, he wouldn't have ended up in this situation.</p><p></p><p>He might have already escaped, opened the teleportation array, and returned to the Starry Skies.</p><p></p><p>But anger aside, his mind was still relatively clear now.</p><p></p><p>The biggest problem was not the Qing Niu, but Ye Xiao!</p><p></p><p>This person was actually able to capture the escaped Qing Niu, his strength was not ordinary!</p><p></p><p>Ye Xiao first healed the Qing Niu, and seeing Ye Xiao's powerful healing techniques, Feng Long's pupils couldn't help but shrink violently.</p><p></p><p>What a terrifying skill, to be able to instantly heal a severely injured demigod beast like this.</p><p></p><p>This level of skill was...</p><p></p><p>Here is the full English translation of the Chinese excerpt:</p><p></p><p>It was beyond the reach of ordinary people. The Blue Ox slowly stood up, then asked with a confused expression:</p><p></p><p>"Where is this place? What happened? How did I end up here?"</p><p></p><p>His three confused questions in a row were met with a loud slap from Feng Long.</p><p></p><p>"Wake up, you idiot! We've been captured by this man and imprisoned in this place called a 'breeding farm'. We've become his livestock."</p><p></p><p>The Blue Ox was stunned.</p><p></p><p>"Livestock? Breeding farm? Feng Long, you've been captured too? And Samuels, Susan? You're all here as well?"</p><p></p><p>The next moment, his gaze immediately fell on Ye Xiao.</p><p></p><p>"Was it you who captured us?"</p><p></p><p>Ye Xiao glanced at him and replied indifferently:</p><p></p><p>"As you can see, I am the owner of the Star Beast Breeding Farm. Starting today, you and Feng Long have become my livestock. You two will have to offer a fixed amount of your meat, cowhide, horns, dragon scales, and other things every day.</p><p></p><p>Of course, if you two are willing to offer more, I will provide you with things to help you cultivate faster and reach the divine beast realm sooner!"</p><p></p><p>The Blue Ox clenched his fists, his eyes full of vigilance and hostility.</p><p></p><p>"What nonsense is this? Who do you think you are? Do you know who I am? How could I possibly become your livestock? Don't be delusional."</p><p></p><p>Boom! The next second, with just a thought, Ye Xiao unleashed the Great Nirvana Fist, and the fist energy appeared directly on the Blue Ox's chest, blasting him away and slamming him hard against the wall.</p><p></p><p>"Puff."</p><p></p><p>The Blue Ox coughed up a mouthful of fresh blood, feeling that all the bones in his chest had been broken, and his internal organs were shaking, causing him unbearable pain that made his soul tremble.</p><p></p><p>But before he could curse out loud, the next second, Ye Xiao had already used a healing spell to repair his body, then crushed his bones with another punch.</p><p></p><p>This cycle repeated, and in just ten seconds, the Blue Ox's ribs were broken over a hundred times.</p><p></p><p>"Stop, stop hitting me! I surrender! I'm willing to be your livestock!"</p><p></p><p>Ye Xiao finally stopped.</p><p></p><p>Feng Long swallowed hard, and a layer of cold sweat appeared on his forehead.</p><p></p><p>It was at this moment that he realized how terrifying this Ye Xiao was! No wonder these star beasts, Samuels and Susan, were all so proud, yet agreed to be livestock here.</p><p></p><p>In front of this guy, you simply couldn't die.</p><p></p><p>He would torture you endlessly until you agreed.</p><p></p><p>And his methods were extremely simple and brutal! You could only agree.</p><p></p><p>There was no other choice besides agreeing.</p><p></p><p>At this moment, Ye Xiao's gaze fell on Feng Long, and the overwhelming aura pressed down on him, instantly making him feel his soul being suppressed.</p><p></p><p>Ye Xiao's strength was extraordinary!</p><p></p><p>Extremely powerful!</p><p></p><p>Completely beyond their ability to resist.</p><p></p><p>Feng Long didn't dare to hesitate for a moment. Fearing that he would follow in the Blue Ox's footsteps, he immediately said:</p><p></p><p>"I-I'm willing too."</p><p></p><p>The moment he finished these three words, the pressure on his body suddenly disappeared.</p><p></p><p>He finally let out a sigh of relief and wiped the cold sweat from his forehead.</p><p></p><p>Fortunately, he didn't let Ye Xiao attack, or else he might have been tortured to death!</p><p></p><p>"Since you two have no objections, starting tomorrow, you will have to start paying your tributes.</p><p></p><p>In addition to the fixed amount I require, if you two are willing to give more, you will receive some support.</p><p></p><p>If you are unwilling to give more, I won't force you too much.</p><p></p><p>But the basic tribute must be paid.</p><p></p><p>Feng Long must pay ten dragon scales and ten jin of dragon meat every day.</p><p></p><p>The Blue Ox must pay one hind leg every day.</p><p></p><p>For now, let's just set these terms. I hope you two will have a pleasant stay at the Star Beast Breeding Farm."</p><p></p><p>With that, Ye Xiao tossed the fresh flowers that Xuan Liuli had collected today to Susan, asking her to gather honey, then turned and left.</p><p></p><p>As soon as Ye Xiao left, the Blue Ox started grumbling.</p><p></p><p>"What the hell? Making me give up one of my own legs every day? Isn't that going to hurt me to death?"</p><p></p><p>The moment the words left his mouth, a cold murderous intent descended upon him.</p><p></p><p>"You stupid ox, how dare you complain in front of me. If it weren't for you, how would I have ended up in this situation today?"</p><p></p><p>The Blue Ox: "(0`)!"</p><p></p><p>"Feng Long, let's talk it out properly, no need for brandishing weapons and violence. Here, you and I are brothers. Surely you can forgive me this once, right? Besides, even if we fought, you might not necessarily beat me."</p><p></p><p>Feng Long slowly suppressed his aura.</p><p></p><p>The Blue Ox let out a sigh of relief.</p><p></p><p>"That's more like it! We brothers should focus on getting along peacefully."</p><p></p><p>Just as he was saying this, the next moment, Feng Long suddenly chopped off his own dragon tail.</p><p></p><p>The Blue Ox's heart skipped a beat.</p><p></p><p>"Feng Long, what are you going crazy about?"</p><p></p><p>Feng Long waved the dragon tail in his hand and sneered coldly.</p><p></p><p>"This tail of mine has at least dozens of jin of dragon meat. But my required amount is only ten jin of dragon meat. If I sacrifice all this dragon meat to Ye Xiao, won't he help me beat you a hundred times?"</p><p></p><p>The Blue Ox: "(˙灬˙)!"</p><p></p><p>"You old eel, you've learned to be bad. You deserve to be kicked!"</p>

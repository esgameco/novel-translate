        <h1>Chapter 49</h1>
        <div class="content">
            <p>Here is the full English translation of the Chinese excerpt:</p><p></p><p>Yang Zhengyi let out a roar, gathering his own power, and wielding a three-foot-long blue sword, he thrust it straight at King Aier's chest.</p><p></p><p>King Aier's face was cold and stern. He directly punched the precious sword, and in an instant, he shattered the sword on the spot.</p><p></p><p>Boom! The sword exploded, and the shards flew back like lasers, instantly piercing through Yang Zhengyi's body, causing him to spit out another mouthful of fresh blood.</p><p></p><p>If it were not for the fact that the Grand Master's physical body was already strong enough, this move alone would have been enough to make him completely perish.</p><p></p><p>But even so, his meridians were severed, and he had lost all vitality, relying only on the last embers to stubbornly refuse to die.</p><p></p><p>"Do you see? This is the gap between gods and men!"</p><p></p><p>King Aier's gaze revealed a trace of mocking, as if looking at an ant.</p><p></p><p>Yang Zhengyi could no longer move, bound by King Aier's lightning chains, his face full of unwillingness.</p><p></p><p>He patted Yang Zhengyi's cheek and smiled evilly.</p><p></p><p>"Don't worry, I won't kill you so quickly, that would be too boring."</p><p></p><p>He glanced back at the city of Jianghai, his eyes filled with a terrifying bloodthirsty light.</p><p></p><p>Yang Zhengyi already seemed to have guessed something.</p><p></p><p>"What are you going to do?"</p><p></p><p>King Aier licked his lips, his eyes revealing a chilling coldness.</p><p></p><p>"Hehe, more than a hundred years ago, it was because of this city that I was suppressed. Today, I will destroy this city right before your eyes!</p><p></p><p>By the way, I haven't tasted the delicious flavor of human flesh for more than a hundred years."</p><p></p><p>Yang Zhengyi shuddered, and the despair that had not appeared on his face when he was defeated now surfaced.</p><p></p><p>"No! You can't do this! No!"</p><p></p><p>"Unfortunately, you have no say in the matter."</p><p></p><p>King Aier's words made Yang Zhengyi's heart completely freeze, overwhelmed by despair!</p><p></p><p>He had lost! Lost miserably.</p><p></p><p>Not only did he fail to destroy one of King Aier's avatars, but he had also dragged the entire Jianghai City with its millions of civilians into it.</p><p></p><p>He had killed some civilians, but that was driven by his obsession to break the seal and destroy King Aier's avatar. </p><p></p><p>But to let the entire Jianghai City and its millions of people die, the last shred of conscience in his heart could not bear it.</p><p></p><p>At this moment, he suddenly regretted! Regretted his own stupidity, hated his own obsession.</p><p></p><p>Why did he have to be so obsessed with revenge?</p><p></p><p>The result was harming others and himself!</p><p></p><p>If time could turn back, he would definitely not do it again.</p><p></p><p>But unfortunately, time cannot be rewound!</p><p></p><p>The rain fell silently on Yang Zhengyi's face, indistinguishable from the tears of regret.</p><p></p><p>King Aier looked at his expression of despair, his face filled with smugness, and turned towards Jianghai City. He noticed a thousand-meter-long sword mark on the riverbank, black and gaping like a giant mouth devouring life.</p><p></p><p>This made him raise his eyebrows slightly, but he soon ignored it.</p><p></p><p>A mere thousand-meter-long sword mark was nothing, a Grand Master's full-power strike could easily do that, and his own main body could casually slash it out, there was nothing to be afraid of.</p><p></p><p>Thinking this, King Aier stepped over the sword mark.</p><p></p><p>But just as he stepped over it, in an instant, King Aier suddenly felt a terrifying crisis approaching, causing all the hair on his body to stand on end!</p><p></p><p>The two sides of this sword mark were like two different worlds. "No..."</p><p></p><p>Before he could finish the word, the next moment, his consciousness plunged into darkness.</p><p></p><p>A dazzling sword beam a hundred thousand feet high instantly split him open, the powerful force...</p><p></p><p>Here is the full English translation of the Chinese excerpt:</p><p></p><p>Directly destroying his powerful physical body completely, not even leaving a single cell behind. Beside him, Yang Zhengyi, seeing this scene, his eyes were wide open in disbelief! At this moment, he finally understood the words Ye Xiao had said before.</p><p></p><p>Those who cross the line, will be ruthlessly eliminated without mercy.</p><p></p><p>He was not joking!</p><p></p><p>He really had this kind of strength! At first, he thought he was just a master, but he didn't expect...</p><p></p><p>Ye Xiao, is he a great master? No, to be able to kill Aier King's clone with a single sword strike, a being so incredibly powerful, is already beyond what a mere great master can accomplish!</p><p></p><p>This guy... is he a Saint Monarch expert? But how old is he? </p><p></p><p>He's only in his twenties! His personal information was forged, but Ye Xiao's information is real!</p><p></p><p>When I was processing his employment, I clearly saw his bone age!</p><p></p><p>He's only twenty years old.</p><p></p><p>A twenty-year-old great master?</p><p></p><p>This guy, is he going to defy the heavens? But after the shock, a tinge of regret surged in Yang Zhengyi's heart.</p><p></p><p>He only learned of this at the very last moment of his life, truly a pity.</p><p></p><p>If he had known earlier, he probably wouldn't have done such a foolish thing.</p><p></p><p>This kid, he hid his true strength so deeply, unfathomable!</p><p></p><p>Bitterly smiling, Yang Zhengyi was also swept up in the aftershock of the sword light, reduced to ashes.</p><p></p><p>But it was worth it.</p><p></p><p>In the final moment of his life, he was able to witness the scene of Aier King's clone being annihilated in an instant, fulfilling his last wish.</p><p></p><p>Moreover, he knew that with Ye Xiao's immense strength, even if Aier King's main body broke through the seal, he no longer needed to worry in the slightest.</p><p></p><p>"You're right, the days are to be lived looking forward, not backward."</p><p></p><p>In his hazy state, Yang Zhengyi seemed to see his master and fellow disciples standing in a sea of light, welcoming him with a smile.</p><p></p><p>...</p><p></p><p>All of this happened in the blink of an eye.</p><p></p><p>The sword light instantly destroyed Aier King's clone and Yang Zhengyi, reducing both the person and the beast to ashes.</p><p></p><p>Afterward, the sword light continued unabated, splitting apart the rain clouds gathered in the sky, and the previously drizzly weather instantly transformed into a clear, cloudless sky.</p><p></p><p>The alarms in Jianghai City gradually subsided, and some citizens began to emerge from the buildings, breathing in the fresh air.</p><p></p><p>In the city center, Ye Xiao walked calmly with his hands behind his back.</p><p></p><p>In this world, there are many inevitabilities, but upon careful consideration, aren't they all due to the lack of ability of the parties involved? If Yang Zhengyi was a Saint Monarch, would anyone dare to easily conceal the deeds of his sect? Or if he could easily deal with Aier King, why would he have to harm so many innocent people?</p><p></p><p>Now, with the help of the Golden Book's divine soul, he has cultivated a mysterious and powerful technique that allows him to surpass his level and defeat his enemies.</p><p></p><p>But how much can he surpass his level? Can he deal with Saint Monarchs? What about those above Saint Monarch?</p><p></p><p>Even if he stays safely in the library, living a peaceful life, what if someone goes after his family and friends?</p><p></p><p>He can't just sit by and watch, can he?</p><p></p><p>The Stellar Beasts invading human territory, he can't just watch as the human race is slaughtered and devoured, either. Humans must become stronger.</p><p></p><p>Only by becoming stronger can he be fearless of anything!</p><p></p><p>It's decided, from now on, he will read an extra hour of books every day!</p><p></p><p>One more thing, I wonder if no one is reading books? The comments seem so cold, but I didn't write anything too controversial, right?</p><p></p><p>Thank you to the readers who have tipped me, I'm deeply grateful.</p><p></p><p>(This chapter is complete)</p>

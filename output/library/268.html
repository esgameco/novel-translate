        <h1>Chapter 268</h1>
        <div class="content">
            <p>Here is the full English translation of the Chinese excerpt:</p><p></p><p>Under the heavens, it is impossible for all the royal domains to have the opportunity to taste the delicacies every day.</p><p></p><p>Perhaps only the powerful imperial domain cultivators on the starry sky battlefield would have the chance to savor them, but even they might not be able to enjoy them every day.</p><p></p><p>In terms of eating, Ye Xiao is truly the number one person in the world! He is such an amazing eater, eating so well.</p><p></p><p>Eating so many delicious things every day, even a pig could become a grandmaster with this kind of diet! Of course, Beitang Ce knew that a large part of the reason Ye Xiao had become so strong was because his natural talent was truly exceptional.</p><p></p><p>Talent, cultivation techniques, and martial dao resources were the fundamental reasons behind his strength.</p><p></p><p>But all success is built upon one's innate talent.</p><p></p><p>If the talent is not enough, even if he were to eat a divine lord-level spirit beast every day, he would never reach Ye Xiao's current level.</p><p></p><p>"Aren't you going to eat?" </p><p></p><p>Ye Xiao saw that he had not picked up his chopsticks and couldn't help but ask.</p><p></p><p>Beitang Ce hurriedly picked up his own chopsticks.</p><p></p><p>"Of course I'll eat! "</p><p></p><p>After saying that, he took out a small bottle of spiritual wine from his storage ring while eating.</p><p></p><p>"This bottle of spiritual wine is my precious collection that I've kept for many years. I've never had the heart to open it, but today let's get drunk together."</p><p></p><p>He poured out the spiritual wine and also handed a cup to Huan Liuli.</p><p></p><p>Huan Liuli sniffed it and then took a small sip, immediately making a disgusted face. "Your spiritual wine is really not that good. It's not even half as good as the wine our master brews. The mouthfeel and taste are far inferior."</p><p></p><p>Beitang Ce was stunned for a moment, then slapped his forehead.</p><p></p><p>"Look at me, I'm so embarrassed. Ye Xiansheng has so many delicious things, how could I not have good wine to offer? I'm really trying to show off in front of the wrong person."</p><p></p><p>Ye Xiao smiled.</p><p></p><p>"It's not that dramatic. Liuli, bring out the wine."</p><p></p><p>"Okay!"</p><p></p><p>Huan Liuli quickly brought out a bottle of wine that Ye Xiao had brewed with honey, deer blood, and deer velvet. Even though it hadn't been aged for long, after being buried in the fake mountain to rapidly absorb the essence of the sun, moon, and heaven and earth, its taste was already very good.</p><p></p><p>After Huan Liuli poured a cup for Beitang Ce, he sniffed it and couldn't help but have his eyes light up.</p><p></p><p>"This is a good wine! Just from the aroma, I can already sense its extraordinary quality."</p><p></p><p>He took a sip and kept praising it.</p><p></p><p>"Wonderful wine! A delicacy of the human world! Ye Xiansheng, your daily life is truly at such a high level.</p><p></p><p>Enjoying the finest spirit beast meat, savoring the finest spiritual wine, no wonder your cultivation is constantly surging upwards!"</p><p></p><p>Ye Xiao still smiled calmly.</p><p></p><p>"By the way, why did you have the time to come by my place this time? Judging from your appearance, you should have just slain three early Heaven-grade spirit beasts. If I'm not mistaken, there shouldn't be any early Heaven-grade spirit beasts in this area."</p><p></p><p>As a King Realm expert, if there were any early Heaven-grade divine lord-level spirit beasts in the vicinity, they definitely wouldn't escape Ye Xiao's detection, nor would they be able to escape his grasp. He would have captured them and brought them to his spirit beast farm.</p><p></p><p>Beitang Ce sighed softly.</p><p></p><p>"You guessed correctly, I came from the north.</p><p></p><p>I should have directly returned to the Central State City, but my heart was troubled, and I couldn't find anyone to confide in, so I took a detour to the Jianghai City to come talk to you, Ye Xiansheng."</p><p></p><p>Ye Xiao ate some dishes while chatting.</p><p></p><p>"What's the matter? What has been troubling you?"</p><p></p><p>"Does Ye Xiansheng happen to have heard about the recent destruction of the Western Dragon Veins?"</p><p></p><p>Ye Xiao nodded.</p><p></p><p>"I've heard a little about it."</p><p></p><p>"What does Ye Xiansheng think about it?"</p><p></p><p>Ye Xiao shook his head again.</p><p></p><p>"I can't really say, but it's certainly not a good thing."</p><p></p><p>Beitang Ce smiled wryly.</p><p></p><p>"It's not just 'not a good thing', it's a huge disaster. Ye Xiansheng, you only know that a small state called Lisheng was destroyed. But in reality, in addition to Lisheng, several other states have also had their Dragon Veins stolen, even if they weren't completely destroyed."</p><p></p><p>Ye Xiao's eyes flickered.</p><p></p><p>"So many Dragon Veins have been stolen?"</p><p></p><p>Beitang Ce nodded.</p><p></p><p>"If my guess is correct, there may be even more Dragon Veins stolen. It's obvious that the spirit beasts are behind this, and their goal is to defeat the human race in the West.</p><p></p><p>As long as all the Western Dragon Veins are gone, their demise won't be far off.</p><p></p><p>Because only the Dragon Veins can absorb large amounts of spiritual energy, allowing a region to have a reasonable spiritual energy supply.</p><p></p><p>Once the Dragon Veins are destroyed, the martial dao of a region will gradually decline."</p><p></p><p>"But I've heard that the Dragon Veins in the Nine States were also destroyed by a certain monarch, yet the Nine States are still prospering."</p><p></p><p>"That's different. The Dragon Veins in the Nine States were actually severed, with only the dragon qi extracted, but they were not completely destroyed. They can still continue to absorb the spiritual energy of heaven and earth.</p><p></p><p>The only difference is that without the dragon qi, they will no longer have the self-awareness of the Dragon Vein body.</p><p></p><p>However, even without the dragon qi, they can still maintain a stable spiritual energy supply. It's just that their spiritual energy supply will remain stagnant, unable to continue growing.</p><p></p><p>But the population of cultivators in the Nine States will continue to increase."</p><p></p><p>Here is my translation of the Chinese excerpt:</p><p></p><p>"This is also why we are now building so many spirit-gathering formations, because the power of the dragon veins can no longer fully satisfy the needs of martial artists."</p><p></p><p>Beitang Ce took a sip of his wine.</p><p></p><p>"It's not that I like the West, it's just that if their lips die, the teeth will feel the cold. If they perish, the Nine Provinces will also be in great trouble. And now, the beast calamity is imminent, and there is no one on the surface of the Nine Provinces strong enough to reverse the situation.</p><p></p><p>In this way, if the West perishes first, the next will be the Nine Provinces. If the human race on the surface is gone, the starry sky battlefield will certainly not last.</p><p></p><p>In the end, the entire human race will be destroyed!</p><p></p><p>It's a pity that Mr. Ye is a divinely talented person, but unfortunately he was born too late. If he had been born a few years earlier, his cultivation should have already reached the King Realm.</p><p></p><p>If Mr. Ye is already at the King Realm cultivation, I would try my best to let him attack the final barrier and reach the legendary Emperor Realm expert! In this way, with Mr. Ye there, the Nine Provinces can be preserved, and the situation on the starry sky battlefield will also be greatly alleviated."</p><p></p><p>Ye Xiao was slightly surprised.</p><p></p><p>He didn't expect Beitang Ce to dare say such things.</p><p></p><p>By saying this, it means that he now has a way to further improve Ye Xiao's strength.</p><p></p><p>Although he doesn't know what the method is, Ye Xiao doesn't want to give up.</p><p></p><p>The beast calamity is imminent, and with his current cultivation speed, he really has no way to ensure that he can break through to the Emperor Realm before the calamity arrives.</p><p></p><p>Because breaking through to the Emperor Realm requires not only cultivation, but also dragon qi to temper the body.</p><p></p><p>Refining the mortal blood into divine blood is the only way to succeed in the breakthrough.</p><p></p><p>Previously, he thought he could break through to the Emperor Realm within a year, but that was based on the premise of having enough dragon qi.</p><p></p><p>Without dragon qi, there's nothing to think about.</p><p></p><p>Now that Beitang Ce says he has a method, perhaps Ye Xiao should seize this opportunity.</p><p></p><p>"What method are you talking about?"</p><p></p><p>Beitang Ce waved his hand.</p><p></p><p>"Saying this now is useless, Mr. Ye's cultivation is not enough, even if I know the method, others may not agree."</p><p></p><p>But just as he was about to finish speaking, a majestic aura suddenly burst forth from Ye Xiao's body! Beitang Ce's body suddenly trembled, his eyes widened, and he looked at Ye Xiao sitting across from him with disbelief, as if he had seen a ghost.</p><p></p><p>"Mr. Ye, you... you... you... you... when did you break through to the King Realm?"</p><p></p><p>Ye Xiao smiled calmly.</p><p></p><p>"Before I came back, I went to the Heavenly Demon Cliff and miraculously broke through."</p><p></p><p>Beitang Ce's head seemed to explode.</p><p></p><p>Ye Xiao had just broken through to the Half-Step King Realm! He had only broken through to the Half-Step King Realm a few days ago! In just a few days, at most not even a month, he had already broken through? </p><p></p><p>A 21-year-old King Realm expert! </p><p></p><p>At 21 years old! </p><p></p><p>How many people throughout history have been able to reach this level? Even those legendary figures of the past have not been as extraordinary as Ye Xiao, right? This completely shattered Beitang Ce's worldview.</p><p></p><p>But it also gave him hope, hope for the entire Nine Provinces, and even the entire human race! Before this, he had been deeply worried about the future of the human race, completely without any hope.</p><p></p><p>But now, he felt like he had gone from hell to heaven.</p><p></p><p>In an instant, he had transformed from despair to being filled with hope! Two clear tears slid down Beitang Ce's cheeks.</p><p></p><p>It was excitement, and even more so, exhilaration!</p><p></p><p>At this moment, he could no longer control his emotions.</p><p></p><p>"The bearing of a Great Emperor! Truly the bearing of a Great Emperor! I never imagined that in my lifetime, I would actually encounter such an existence? Mr. Ye, you should be the reincarnation of the Emperor!"</p><p></p><p>Beitang Ce didn't know if it was the alcohol or just being too excited, but he shouted loudly, worshipping Ye Xiao as an idol.</p><p></p><p>No, to be precise, in this moment, Ye Xiao had become more than just an idol in Beitang Ce's heart - he was an existence akin to a divine being!</p><p></p><p>Huanliuli: "Wonderful! As expected of my master, only my master can reach this level.</p><p></p><p>I've decided, I must give my master a few little kittens to express my utmost reverence and awe for him!</p><p></p><p>My master is the best!"</p><p></p><p>Beitang Ce lost his composure for a brief moment, then wiped the tears from his eyes.</p><p></p><p>"Mr. Ye, I apologize, I got too excited and made you uncomfortable."</p><p></p><p>"No need to apologize." </p><p></p><p>Ye Xiao shook his head. Perhaps because this was his own cultivation, he was not as moved as Beitang Ce.</p><p></p><p>However, he was a bit proud in his heart. His talent in the mortal world had already reached an incredibly heaven-defying level.</p><p></p><p>So he could understand Beitang Ce's current state of mind.</p><p></p><p>After all, the Golden Book Spiritual Consciousness was too powerful, too monstrous!</p><p></p><p>At the same time, he was also quite relieved that this Golden Book Spiritual Consciousness was his own, otherwise it would have been quite distressing.</p><p></p><p>"Oh yes, you just said that if I was already at the King Realm, you have a way to help me advance even further in a short time? Is that true?"</p>

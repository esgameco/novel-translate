        <h1>Chapter 378</h1>
        <div class="content">
            <p>Here is the full English translation of the Chinese excerpt:</p><p></p><p>"No, Supreme Deity. She is just a child, please forgive her! Wah wah wah. I am willing to do anything for the Supreme Deity."</p><p></p><p>As she spoke, she peeled off her fox fur cloak, revealing her pale, fragrant shoulders underneath.</p><p></p><p>However, the next moment, she was greeted with a ruthless whip.</p><p></p><p>Crack—! "Ah—!"</p><p></p><p>The whip struck her shoulders, causing her flesh to be torn and mangled, eliciting a heart-wrenching scream from her.</p><p></p><p>The Black Soul Deity Clan continued to lash her shoulders.</p><p></p><p>"Foolish fox, do you think you have the right to bargain with me? I let you live, and I let you die. You have no right to bargain with me! </p><p></p><p>I want to play with you, so I will play with you. Do you think you can exchange your body with me? Damn stupid fox, do you deserve it? Your life, your body, your dignity, everything belongs to me!"</p><p></p><p>The surrounding Black Soul Deity Clan members could not help but burst into laughter, overjoyed at the sight. They were able to arbitrarily dominate the Silver Fox Clan, just as humans could dominate animals. The Silver Fox Clan members, seeing this, were filled with grief and indignation, but they were powerless. </p><p></p><p>Because their strength was simply too weak, they had no way to resist.</p><p></p><p>Behind them stood two towering stone pillars reaching up to the sky. </p><p></p><p>Hanging from them were the most revered Empress of the Silver Fox Clan and the young master, Ning Yuheng. </p><p></p><p>They had both been beaten to a pulp, covered in fresh blood.</p><p></p><p>Ning Yuheng's leg had been broken, and the blood slowly dripped down the stone pillar, drying on its surface.</p><p></p><p>Ning Yuheng's heart was filled with sorrow and anger.</p><p></p><p>He was sorrowful for the plight of the Silver Fox Clan, and angry at their suffering.</p><p></p><p>At this moment, a figure suddenly descended from the spiritual energy ship above, shouting loudly:</p><p></p><p>"Stop the commotion! Quickly prepare, a powerful expert from the Xuanyuan Deity Clan is about to arrive. This is a big catch. Capturing him will earn us more than excavating ten divine tombs."</p><p></p><p>At these words, everyone immediately sprang into action! The Black Soul Clan member who had been whipping the mother and daughter foxes also immediately abandoned the half-dead foxes and rushed to gather with the others.</p><p></p><p>Ning Yuheng couldn't help but murmur.</p><p></p><p>"An expert from the Xuanyuan Deity Clan? Why would an expert from the Xuanyuan Deity Clan come to this place? This is the territory of other deity clans, they have no reason to come here."</p><p></p><p>"Wait a moment."</p><p></p><p>He suddenly thought of something, and his heartbeat began to quicken.</p><p></p><p>Could it be, could it be the Master? Has he obtained news of me and come to rescue me? No! Master, you must not come! </p><p></p><p>Here are all deity clans, if you come, you will surely die!</p><p></p><p>Ning Yuheng knew that Ye Xiao was very powerful, but he also knew that Ye Xiao's strength had not yet reached the divine realm. </p><p></p><p>It was said that to reach the Empyrean Realm, one had to cultivate 108 dragons, and the spiritual energy required for each dragon was comparable to the amount required to cultivate from an ordinary cultivator to the Empyrean Realm. So it was impossible that it could be the Master, his cultivation speed could not be that fast.</p><p></p><p>Since they said it was an expert from the Xuanyuan Deity Clan, it should be someone else.</p><p></p><p>Although he might feel a little disappointed that it was not the Master, Ning Yuheng was mostly relieved.</p><p></p><p>Because that way, the Master would not be in any danger.</p><p></p><p>Even if the newcomer did not care about the lives of the Silver Fox Clan when dealing with the Black Soul Deity Clan, and slaughtered them all together, that would still be better.</p><p></p><p>At least it would be far better than the current situation, where the entire Silver Fox Clan was being humiliated and could neither seek life nor seek death.</p><p></p><p>The only regret was that he would never have the chance to see the Master one more time in this life.</p><p></p><p>Master, I have received so much of your grace, and have not had the chance to repay you. It seems I can only do so in the next life.</p><p></p><p>At this moment, a brilliant star appeared in the distant sky.</p><p></p><p>"They're here! They're coming!"</p><p></p><p>A member of the Black Soul Deity Clan couldn't help but exclaim excitedly.</p><p></p><p>All eyes immediately turned towards that direction.</p><p></p><p>"So fast!"</p><p></p><p>The exclamation had barely left their mouths when, in less than three seconds, the newcomer had arrived from tens of thousands of miles away.</p><p></p><p>"He's here! Get ready! Activate the formation!"</p><p></p><p>"The formation is already set up."</p><p></p><p>"The poison pills are ready!"</p><p></p><p>"The poison pills are prepared."</p><p></p><p>"The clan's top experts will join forces. Once he enters the formation, we'll concentrate all our power to kill him."</p><p></p><p>"Haha, we'll just wait for him to walk into the trap."</p><p></p><p>Boom—! Just as they finished exchanging these words, Ye Xiao had already arrived, holding the soul of Xiong Benkong in his hand.</p><p></p><p>Seeing Ye Xiao's figure, Ning Yuheng's pupils instantly contracted, and then his eyes were filled with tears.</p><p></p><p>It's the Master! It really is the Master! The Master has come to rescue him.</p><p></p><p>The Master must have heard about his situation from that Black Soul Deity Clan member.</p><p></p><p>Here is my translation of the Chinese excerpt:</p><p></p><p>The main manager quickly reacted and shouted loudly:</p><p></p><p>"Manager, you can't come here. Hurry and leave! They have set a trap to catch you. They want to kill you. If you stay here, you will die!"</p><p></p><p>Ye Xiao did not speak, but only looked at the stone pillar where Ning Yuhen was, and a murderous intent flashed in his eyes, becoming extremely thick.</p><p></p><p>When was the last time he had such a strong killing intent? Oh yes, it was when Beitang Ce had his Ghostfire Spiritual Eyes dug out.</p><p></p><p>At that time, he had wiped out a group of high-level experts from the Thunder God Clan, the Wing God Clan, and the Giant Ape God Clan, not leaving a single one.</p><p></p><p>Just at this moment, several formations suddenly lit up under his feet.</p><p></p><p>These formations had effects like restraining the body, restraining spiritual energy, and reducing attacks - each one was terrifying enough to make one's hair stand on end, and all of them together could reduce a Deity Realm cultivator of the 7th or 8th level down to below the 5th level in combat strength!</p><p></p><p>The moment the formations lit up, several poisonous pills were shot at him.</p><p></p><p>Boom, boom, boom. Various poisonous pills exploded around Ye Xiao, with strong corrosive power that could reduce his spiritual energy, corrode his meridians and blood vitality, further weakening his strength.</p><p></p><p>In this way, Ye Xiao would not be able to withstand their attacks at all.</p><p></p><p>Then came the fierce bombardment of attacks from the Black Soul Clan experts.</p><p></p><p>Countless beams of light, like cannonballs, were frantically shot towards the poisonous mist.</p><p></p><p>Boom, boom, boom. Violent explosions rang out, illuminating the entire star island with scorching light.</p><p></p><p>"Manager! Ahhhhh!" </p><p></p><p>Ning Yuhen cried out in heartbroken anguish.</p><p></p><p>The person he valued most in his life was the manager, who was like an elder brother to him. Seeing the manager die before his eyes would be even more painful than being killed himself.</p><p></p><p>The explosions lasted for nearly half a minute before stopping.</p><p></p><p>Ye Xiao's Xionggang Book had an upturned corner, as if to say that Ye Xiao should be dead by now, right?</p><p></p><p>As a member of the Black Soul Clan, his cultivation method was exactly the same as the Black Soul Clan's, and now that he was in spirit form, these attacks couldn't hurt him.</p><p></p><p>But Ye Xiao was different - he didn't know these things, and the Black Soul Clan's fierce attacks, each one a true injury, would be too much for him to endure.</p><p></p><p>However, when he tried to break free from Ye Xiao's grasp, he found that, just like before, Ye Xiao's big hand was firmly clamping him down, and he couldn't escape at all.</p><p></p><p>Xionggang Book: "?"</p><p></p><p>He turned his head to look at what was happening, but the next moment, his entire spirit body was completely petrified.</p><p></p><p>Ye Xiao was completely unharmed! Not a single hair on him had fallen off.</p><p></p><p>Damn it! This guy was actually this strong?</p><p></p><p>Xionggang Book was shocked to the extreme, and then suddenly thought of something. He wanted to immediately open his mouth and have these clansmen launch another attack, without stopping!</p><p></p><p>But the next moment, he found that he could not speak.</p><p></p><p>Because Ye Xiao had firmly grasped his soul power. Although Ye Xiao had not yet cultivated a spiritual art at the divine level, he had the Primal Eyes, which could also target soul power and instantly paralyze him.</p><p></p><p>A sense of foreboding gradually emerged in his heart.</p><p></p><p>Sure enough, the next moment, Ye Xiao raised his hand and struck with a punch.</p><p></p><p>Nine Star Divine Art, Shattering Star Fist!</p><p></p><p>No, to be precise, it was not one punch, but two, three, four punches - nearly one punch every 0.01 seconds.</p><p></p><p>The moment the punches were unleashed, they self-tracked, like shooting stars, bursting forth from the dust and smoke.</p><p></p><p>Outside, the Black Soul Clan experts, having just launched a barrage of attacks, were now somewhat panting.</p><p></p><p>But their eyebrows were excited, because Ye Xiao was dead! That was enough.</p><p></p><p>"Xionggang Book, what are you still cowering in there for? Our attacks can't hurt you anyway, so hurry up and get out! Stop pretending to be a god in there. What the hell are you doing?"</p><p></p><p>However, as soon as he finished speaking, a punch burst forth from the dust and smoke, directly piercing through his chest.</p><p></p><p>Then the second, third, and fourth ones - in the blink of an eye, several Black Soul Clan experts were all killed, and all of them were one-hit kills.</p><p></p><p>At this time, the dust and smoke was dispersed by Ye Xiao's punches, and Ning Yuhen, seeing this scene, was dumbfounded, forgetting that he had been crying with a long nose.</p><p></p><p>The manager had endured so many intense attacks, but was actually unharmed? Was he dreaming?</p><p></p><p>The Black Soul Clan members, on the other hand, immediately changed to a grave expression.</p><p></p><p>"Damn it! He's fine!"</p><p></p><p>However, just as they were about to take action, the Black Clan members controlling the formations suddenly exclaimed, "Don't attack yet, some of us need to help suppress the formations. His power is too strong, we're barely able to control him."</p><p></p><p>Everyone was shocked, and all existences below the Deity Realm immediately helped suppress the formations.</p><p></p><p>Without the formations restraining him, who knows how much Ye Xiao's strength would increase?</p>

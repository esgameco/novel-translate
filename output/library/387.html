        <div class="content">
            <p>Here is the full English translation of the Chinese excerpt:</p><p></p><p>After finishing dinner, Ye Xiao began to prepare to go out and search for the Shen King's Tomb in the starry sky.</p><p></p><p>Before setting out, he also took the time to dress up, so as to prevent others from discovering his identity.</p><p></p><p>After doing all this, Ye Xiao flew straight up towards the starry sky.</p><p></p><p>However, as soon as he had flown halfway, his body suddenly came to a stop.</p><p></p><p>Something was not right, there was a very strong energy rapidly approaching him.</p><p></p><p>There was an intent to kill! Ye Xiao's perception ability was now extremely powerful. Even though he himself had not yet reached the Slay God Realm, the killing intent above the Slay God Realm could not escape his perception.</p><p></p><p>As for those below the Slay God Realm, it was even easier.</p><p></p><p>He did not leave, because he really wanted to know who was targeting him from behind.</p><p></p><p>The next moment, he discovered the other party.</p><p></p><p>It was a wolf!</p><p></p><p>A beast lord Xuanming Wolf whose cultivation was comparable to the eighth level of the Divine Realm.</p><p></p><p>Ye Xiao's eyes lit up.</p><p></p><p>"How lucky I am today? No wonder my left eye has been twitching, it turns out there is good news."</p><p></p><p>As he spoke, the Xuanming Wolf had already rushed to Ye Xiao's side and opened its bloody maw.</p><p></p><p>"Roar~!"</p><p></p><p>Accompanied by a thunderous roar, the Xuanming Wolf passed away peacefully.</p><p></p><p>Even at the moment of its death, it still did not understand how it had died.</p><p></p><p>It only felt that it was running, and suddenly, its head took flight, spinning in the air, and it watched its own body rush into Ye Xiao's storage ring.</p><p></p><p>The next moment, its consciousness sank into the darkness.</p><p></p><p>Ye Xiao happily ran back.</p><p></p><p>Since he had obtained a beast lord, there was no need to go find the Shen King's Tomb anymore.</p><p></p><p>The two beast stars would complement each other well in terms of consumption, and he would definitely gain a lot of blood qi.</p><p></p><p>The meat of this wolf must be extremely delicious. He had already thought of a whole menu, including wolf meat soup, wolf meat hot pot, wolf meat buns, stir-fried wolf meat, and braised wolf meat.</p><p></p><p>At the same time, in the distant Cloud Family's Spiritual Energy Battleship, Cloud Shui, who was in closed-door cultivation, suddenly opened his eyes, his brows furrowed, revealing a hint of coldness.</p><p></p><p>"Cloud Zhen Wu."</p><p></p><p>"Here, Elder."</p><p></p><p>A figure quickly ran in from outside and cupped his hands towards Cloud Shui.</p><p></p><p>"The Xuanming Wolf has been killed."</p><p></p><p>"What?"</p><p></p><p>Cloud Zhen Wu's pupils suddenly contracted.</p><p></p><p>If the Xuanming Wolf was just an ordinary minor character, it would have been fine.</p><p></p><p>But it was a beast lord comparable to the eighth level of the Divine Realm.</p><p></p><p>And he had been out for a very short time, for someone to be able to slay an existence of that level in such a short time, their cultivation must be at least at the Slay God Realm!</p><p></p><p>"How is this possible? This human world does not have so many terrifying existences? Could it be other families' Slay God Realm experts? Have we been discovered by other families' Slay God Realm powerhouses?"</p><p></p><p>"It's not necessarily that serious. It's also possible that the Xuanming Wolf trespassed on the other party's territory and was killed as a result.</p><p></p><p>It was my oversight. I just wanted to use it to find that child, without exposing our identities, but I didn't expect the Xuanming Wolf might be slain by other families' powerhouses.</p><p></p><p>After all, the Shen Clan and the beast stars are not on good terms."</p><p></p><p>"Should I go investigate who did this?"</p><p></p><p>"No need. If you don't go investigate, they won't know who did it. If you go investigate, they might become suspicious."</p><p></p><p>"Then what do we do next?"</p><p></p><p>"Hehe."</p><p></p><p>Cloud Shui waved his hand grandly.</p><p></p><p>"Go bring the Lan Xin Daffodil that I've been raising."</p><p></p><p>"Yes, sir!"</p><p></p><p>Cloud Zhen Wu quickly brought over a flower pot, in which a beautiful, fragrant daffodil was planted.</p><p></p><p>Although it was just a flower, the extremely powerful aura it faintly emanated pressed down on Cloud Zhen Wu, making his breathing somewhat difficult.</p><p></p><p>After all, Cloud Zhen Wu was a powerhouse above the fifth level of the Divine Realm.</p><p></p><p>Cloud Shui waved his hand, and the Lan Xin Daffodil instantly transformed into a purple lightning bolt, falling into his palm.</p><p></p><p>"Raising an army for a thousand days, and using it in a single moment! Over the years, I have captured and slaughtered countless super-divine beast stars for your sake, and even slain more than ten beast lords, just to cultivate you to the point of being comparable to the eighth level of the Divine Realm.</p><p></p><p>Today is the time for you to repay me.</p><p></p><p>Find that child and bring his divine body back to me."</p><p></p><p>The Lan Xin Daffodil let out a soft cry, and then instantly transformed into a purple lightning bolt, flying out the window.</p><p></p><p>Cloud Zhen Wu couldn't help but ask in doubt:</p><p></p><p>"Elder Cloud, this Lan Xin Daffodil's strength is only at the eighth level of the Divine Realm, and its power is not much different from the previous Xuanming Wolf. Sending it out, won't it still be unsafe?"</p><p></p><p>"Hehe."</p><p></p><p>Cloud Shui chuckled twice.</p><p></p><p>"You don't understand. The Lan Xin Daffodil I've raised, although its strength appears similar to the Xuanming Wolf, has a special trait - it was cultivated from heavenly materials and earthly treasures, so it is naturally attuned to the earth, wind, water, and wood elements.</p><p></p><p>Therefore, it is extremely skilled at hiding. </p><p></p><p>Not only those at the same level, even those at the Slay God Realm would find it difficult to easily detect its presence.</p><p></p><p>Here is the full English translation of the Chinese excerpt:</p><p></p><p>"Unless the other party is stronger than her in strength and has also awakened the divine eyes! Or they have cultivated spiritual power at the divine art level.</p><p></p><p>Otherwise, even if she stands right in front of them, the other party would never be able to detect her existence."</p><p></p><p>"Sss~! Indeed, it is truly a remarkable existence that was cultivated by Elder Cloud. This power is truly terrifying. The True Martial Elder has witnessed it."</p><p></p><p>Cloud Water nodded.</p><p></p><p>"You can go down first, it won't be long before Lanxin Lotus should be able to bring that young man back. Before that, this old man still needs to continue his closed-door cultivation."</p><p></p><p>"Yes!"</p><p></p><p>On Ye Xiao's side, he had been busy the entire night, finally resolving all the Abyssal Wolves.</p><p></p><p>The Abyssal Wolves were too large, one pot could not fit them all, so Ye Xiao had forged three large iron pots.</p><p></p><p>Because his strength had reached the Beast Sovereign realm, comparable to the eighth layer of the Divine Realm, the blood qi in his body was incredibly rich, as one could imagine.</p><p></p><p>The ordinary pots in the mortal world simply could not stew his meat to softness.</p><p></p><p>Fortunately, Ye Xiao had already learned the divine art of forging and the Great Heavenly Contention divine art, two divine-level forging techniques.</p><p></p><p>So he was able to easily manufacture the three large iron pots.</p><p></p><p>Ye Xiao had been busy the entire night, and it was not until the next morning that he was finally able to enjoy a fragrant wolf meat soup and wolf meat buns.</p><p></p><p>Adding some pepper powder, fragrant oil to remove the gaminess, cilantro and garlic shoots to enhance the freshness.</p><p></p><p>The taste was simply exquisite.</p><p></p><p>After finishing his breakfast, Ye Xiao felt a warm sensation throughout his body, replenishing an unknown amount of blood qi and strength.</p><p></p><p>Feeling his increasingly powerful divine physique, Ye Xiao's mood was exceptionally relaxed.</p><p></p><p>The only thing he regretted was that while he now had meat to eat every day, if he could also obtain some heavenly materials and earthly treasures, that would be truly wonderful.</p><p></p><p>Eating too much meat can be uncomfortable, so it's necessary to balance it with some vegetarian dishes to achieve full nutritional balance.</p><p></p><p>But this problem, for Ye Xiao, was truly hopeless.</p><p></p><p>After all, finding Beast Sovereign-level spirit beasts was already as difficult as ascending to the heavens! </p><p></p><p>The two he had were delivered right to his doorstep.</p><p></p><p>Finding that level of heavenly materials and earthly treasures would be at least ten times more difficult than finding those two spirit beasts.</p><p></p><p>Why? </p><p></p><p>Because spirit beasts are particularly numerous and grow quickly.</p><p></p><p>While heavenly materials and earthly treasures, being plants and herbs, initially have no spiritual intelligence.</p><p></p><p>By the time they cultivate spiritual intelligence, it would have taken countless years, possibly even tens of thousands of years.</p><p></p><p>How could one easily find such high-level existences?</p><p></p><p>Even in the spiritual rich regions where the divine clans often reside, it would not be easy, let alone in the peripheral regions of the Canglan Star Realm.</p><p></p><p>However, as evening approached, the time when the library closed...Ye Xiao: "(!_!)"</p><p></p><p>He simply could not believe his eyes at what he saw.</p><p></p><p>What did he see? A water lotus flower, exuding an extremely powerful aura of heavenly and earthly spiritual energy, was strolling down the streets of Jianghai City, seemingly searching for something.</p><p></p><p>She was already able to take on a human form, with a cold and proud appearance, but with Ye Xiao's divine eyes, he could instantly see her true form - a water lotus flower, and judging by her cultivation, she was comparable to the eighth layer of the Divine Realm.</p><p></p><p>His luck was simply too good, wasn't it?</p><p></p><p>He had just thought about this in the morning, and now in the evening he encountered one on the streets.</p><p></p><p>To put it bluntly, the probability of this happening was over ten thousand times more difficult than winning the lottery.</p><p></p><p>But now, the impossible had happened right before his eyes.</p><p></p><p>So even though Ye Xiao's mentality was extremely strong, he could not help but feel shocked.</p><p></p><p>However, he quickly reacted and a slight smile appeared on his lips as he directly followed after her.</p><p></p><p>In Ye Xiao's underground cellar, the Abyssal Wolf was still stunned.</p><p></p><p>Until now, he still could not believe what had happened to him.</p><p></p><p>He had been captured and treated like livestock, kept in an underground cellar? </p><p></p><p>What kind of joke was this? He was a mighty Beast Sovereign, comparable to the eighth layer of the Divine Realm!</p><p></p><p>An extremely terrifying existence.</p><p></p><p>Yet he was being treated like livestock by a mere human?</p><p></p><p>What was even more tragic was that he discovered this small cellar was shockingly powerful, and he had absolutely no way to break through it.</p><p></p><p>"This damned human race, how dare they be so audacious! This lord will definitely kill him, skin him, eat his flesh, and gnaw on his bones."</p><p></p><p>The big fish was lying in the corner, not even bothering to swim.</p><p></p><p>"It's better to save your energy. I've tried many times already. The formation here is a Nine Star Divine Formation, not even if the two of us work together would we be able to break through it."</p><p></p><p>The Abyssal Wolf refused to believe this fact and frantically rammed against the cellar walls.</p><p></p><p>Half an hour later, his body covered in blood, he gritted his teeth hatefully:</p><p></p><p>"I will never give up. If not today, then a hundred days from now. If not a hundred days, then a year. If not a year, then a hundred years! This lord will definitely escape this place."</p><p></p><p>Three in the morning, nine thousand words.</p><p></p><p>Seeking recommendation votes and monthly votes.</p><p></p><p>A loyal reader said that some idiotic Cloud Clan members appeared, but I don't always write like this. If there were only good people, how would Ye Xiao need to be on guard? Right? At least the majority of the Xuanyuan Divine Clan want to support Ye Xiao. To put it bluntly, even in a class there are one or two bad apples.</p><p></p><p>(This chapter is complete)</p>

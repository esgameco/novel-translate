        <h1>Chapter 218</h1>
        <div class="content">
            <p>Here is the full English translation of the Chinese excerpt:</p><p></p><p>Humanity was unified and gathered into a series of cities, where they underwent systematic training and cultivation, allowing for their orderly growth.</p><p></p><p>For those with exceptional achievements, vast resources were devoted to rapidly elevating them into powerful beings.</p><p></p><p>For the majority, while they may have been more mediocre, their overall strength still increased at a very rapid pace.</p><p></p><p>In this regard, the Star Beast clan was far inferior to the human race.</p><p></p><p>This was because the Star Beast clan lacked any real management system, and was too chaotic.</p><p></p><p>The Star Beasts believed in the principle of the strong devouring the weak, where only the powerful could rule over the weak.</p><p></p><p>But they forgot one thing - many powerful beings may have derived their strength from their physique or bloodline.</p><p></p><p>For example, a Star Beast with a Dragon-level bloodline would find it much easier to grow stronger than one with a Wolf-level bloodline.</p><p></p><p>However, intelligence cannot be improved solely through bloodline.</p><p></p><p>Who could guarantee that a Wolf-level bloodline would always have a duller mind than a Dragon-level one? Noel Fis had begun to ponder - if he were to become a Realm King-level expert in the future, capable of commanding a large group of Star Beasts, should he consider adopting the human model?</p><p></p><p>If successful, he might be able to cultivate a batch of incredibly powerful Star Beasts.</p><p></p><p>After all, once the human race was exterminated from this world, the wars would be between the Star Beasts themselves.</p><p></p><p>In a world of the strong devouring the weak, with limited resources, the conflicts would never cease.</p><p></p><p>By cultivating a group of powerful Star Beasts in advance, Noel Fis could gain greater advantages in the future wars between the Star Beasts.</p><p></p><p>As he was pondering this, he suddenly noticed a large group of people lining up to buy something on the street ahead.</p><p></p><p>This puzzled him, but when he took a closer look, his expression immediately turned cold.</p><p></p><p>It was a spicy squid shop, selling skewers of spicy squid!</p><p></p><p>Although they were not his descendants, just a group of ordinary squids, they were still distant relatives to him.</p><p></p><p>And in a sense, eating spicy squid skewers right in front of him, a giant octopus, was tantamount to slapping him in the face.</p><p></p><p>However, Noel Fis did not take any action.</p><p></p><p>After being trapped for three hundred years, his mind was no longer that of the foolish octopus he once was.</p><p></p><p>He was easily provoked by anything he saw.</p><p></p><p>Now, he was more concerned with strategy.</p><p></p><p>He should first locate and reintegrate his scattered body parts, so that his cultivation could reach its peak state. That way, even if human experts came, he would not need to fear them.</p><p></p><p>"I wonder where the Soul-Gathering Formation in Jianghai City is? I should find someone with a tongue to ask about it," Noel Fis thought, as he entered the crowd to search for his target.</p><p></p><p>On the other side, Ye Xiao had waited in line for a while and finally bought a bucket of spicy squid skewers, feeling very satisfied as he walked out of the spicy squid shop.</p><p></p><p>Although he now had the meat of Noel Fis' Star Beast to eat, which had a better texture and was more tender, Q-shaped, fibrous, and smooth, he couldn't help but occasionally crave the taste of his childhood.</p><p></p><p>These fried skewers, while far inferior in flavor to the meat of the Divine Ancestor Star Beast, were still filled with the taste of his youth.</p><p></p><p>"I wonder if there will be any delicious food in the Central Continent? Since the Central Continent is larger than Jianghai City, there should be even more delicacies there."</p><p></p><p>After getting the skewers, he should head back home to pack his belongings and give Huan Liuli some instructions for her work.</p><p></p><p>However, Ye Xiao had not walked far when he suddenly stopped in his tracks.</p><p></p><p>Amidst the crowd, he spotted a figure - a tall man in a windbreaker with a thick beard.</p><p></p><p>That's... Noel Fis, isn't it?</p><p></p><p>How could he be here?</p><p></p><p>Had he escaped? Was the seal broken?</p><p></p><p>A flurry of questions arose in Ye Xiao's mind.</p><p></p><p>But it shouldn't be possible! If the seal had truly been broken, he should have sensed it.</p><p></p><p>No, something wasn't quite right. This person gave off an even stronger aura than Noel Fis.</p><p></p><p>He might even be stronger than Sai Muer, the subordinate of the Tiger God Seat.</p><p></p><p>Could this be Noel Fis' true body?</p><p></p><p>Ye Xiao suddenly understood the crux of the matter.</p><p></p><p>After Dao Sword Li Liushui had fallen into demonic cultivation, he was now causing disturbances in Shaolin. If he went berserk, with his cultivation, he could easily create turmoil in all of Shaolin.</p><p></p><p>If this was the time when Noel Fis' true body escaped, it would be very likely for him to come to Jianghai City first to find and reintegrate with his scattered parts.</p><p></p><p>Ye Xiao's mouth curled into a slight smile as he took a fierce bite of the spicy squid skewer, his eyes gleaming with excitement.</p><p></p><p>Although he had already tasted the meat of Noel Fis' scattered part, that part only had Innate Seventh-Grade strength. But Noel Fis' true body was an actual Innate Ninth-Grade, Divine Ancestor-level expert!</p><p></p><p>Stronger cultivation meant even higher quality Star Beast meat.</p><p></p><p>At this moment, Noel Fis had also noticed Ye Xiao.</p><p></p><p>Here is the full English translation of the Chinese excerpt:</p><p></p><p>There was no other way. He was a super strong expert with extraordinary perception. Constantly being watched by someone, he was bound to notice it.</p><p></p><p>The moment he saw Ye Xiao, his eyes couldn't help but narrow.</p><p></p><p>Has this guy already seen through his identity? Wow! He was a Ninth Rank Innate Realm expert, yet the other party was actually able to see through his true body. His cultivation must be extraordinary as well!</p><p></p><p>If that's the case, his status in the Jianghai City shouldn't be low either. He should be able to get some information from him, and then it would be easy to find his split bodies.</p><p></p><p>Perfect.</p><p></p><p>"Damn it."</p><p></p><p>However, just as he was about to make a move, the opposite Ye Xiao spoke first.</p><p></p><p>"This is not the place to talk. Let's find a more open space to have a good discussion."</p><p></p><p>With that, Ye Xiao instantly disappeared from the spot, his speed so fast that no one even noticed him leaving.</p><p></p><p>Nolphius didn't find it strange. Since the other party could see through his true body, his cultivation must be extremely powerful. Moving so fast was only natural.</p><p></p><p>Moreover, Ye Xiao didn't display the Divine Intent Technique to reveal his true powerful strength, so as not to alarm Nolphius and make him flee.</p><p></p><p>Ye Xiao arrived in the sky, and Nolphius followed closely behind.</p><p></p><p>The two stood high up in the starry sky, above the clouds, facing each other from a distance.</p><p></p><p>When it was just the two of them, Nolphius suddenly had a strange feeling.</p><p></p><p>He felt like he was very familiar with the person in front of him.</p><p></p><p>He couldn't understand why he would have this feeling, as he was absolutely certain that he had never seen Ye Xiao before.</p><p></p><p>The memory of a Ninth Rank Innate Realm expert would not be wrong.</p><p></p><p>But where did this deep sense of familiarity come from? "Have we met before?"</p><p></p><p>He asked calmly, and Ye Xiao leisurely finished the last spicy squid skewer, wiped the chili oil from his mouth with spiritual energy, and then raised his fist.</p><p></p><p>"You'll know soon enough."</p><p></p><p>Nolphius was stunned, even a little dumbfounded.</p><p></p><p>What was this guy trying to do? Dare to attack him? He felt like laughing.</p><p></p><p>No way, no way, no way!</p><p></p><p>This guy couldn't be so ridiculous, could he?</p><p></p><p>Who did he think he was? Daring to attack the mighty Nolphius?</p><p></p><p>He was just about to speak when the next moment, Ye Xiao struck.</p><p></p><p>The Great Nirvana Fist was unleashed!</p><p></p><p>The overwhelming fist force made him swallow the word "die" he was about to say, his pupils constricting.</p><p></p><p>Clearly, he didn't expect Ye Xiao to be so powerful.</p><p></p><p>Not daring to be careless, he immediately began to resist, activating his body to evade the attack.</p><p></p><p>Ye Xiao seemed to have anticipated this, and in the moment Nolphius shifted, he instantly used the Divine Intent Technique to appear above Nolphius' head.</p><p></p><p>Nolphius' entire body felt like it was electrified, shocked to the point of numbness.</p><p></p><p>"So fast!"</p><p></p><p>He was somewhat frightened, not daring to be careless, and punched towards Ye Xiao.</p><p></p><p>Ye Xiao then struck down with another Great Nirvana Fist.</p><p></p><p>Nolphius' technique should also be an Imperial Art, but in the face of Ye Xiao, it seemed a bit inadequate.</p><p></p><p>Boom! The collision of their powerful fists instantly shook the sky, scattering the clouds and revealing a pure starry sky.</p><p></p><p>This explosive sound once again shocked the entire Jianghai City.</p><p></p><p>"What's happening? Such a loud thunder! Is it going to rain again? Quick, go home and bring in the clothes!"</p><p></p><p>"No, it's strong experts fighting in the sky again!"</p><p></p><p>"Is it Senior Sword Immortal again?"</p><p></p><p>"It must be. Except for Senior Sword Immortal, no one else can unleash such an attack."</p><p></p><p>"Damn it, how many times this month? I got caught in the middle again. Break up! I'm breaking up with you!"</p><p></p><p>"It's not my fault! I got scared too! You said break up? Okay, break up. Get out of here now."</p><p></p><p>"Ah ah ah, don't push me, it's going to break! Ah ah ah, it's really going to break!"</p><p></p><p>In the sky, after exchanging a punch with Ye Xiao, the tremendous shockwave caused Nolphius' entire body to tremble violently.</p><p></p><p>Fortunately, most of his body was made of soft tissues, not bones. So, while he was deformed by Ye Xiao's punch, he didn't sustain any serious injuries.</p><p></p><p>However, he was still blasted away like a cannonball.</p><p></p><p>Boom! "Such powerful strength!" Nolphius couldn't help but exclaim.</p><p></p><p>How could this human be so strong? After all, even the Ninth Rank Innate Realm experts of Shaolin were only a handful.</p><p></p><p>But Shaolin was a place of prominence in the Nine Realms. This was just a small Jianghai City!</p><p></p><p>This city could be called a trash heap, and he could easily destroy it, yet it had produced a Ninth Rank Innate Realm expert?</p>

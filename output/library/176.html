        <h1>Chapter 176</h1>
        <div class="content">
            <p>Here is the full English translation of the Chinese excerpt:</p><p></p><p>"I'm just joking with you! Isn't it funny?"</p><p></p><p>Just as Ye Xiao was feeling conflicted, Liu Chengxun suddenly spoke up and laughed.</p><p></p><p>Ye Xiao: "(_..)!"</p><p></p><p>Seeing Ye Xiao's cold and indifferent expression, Liu Chengxun's laughter gradually subsided.</p><p></p><p>Isn't it normal for people to frequently make jokes with each other in order to deepen their friendship?</p><p></p><p>But it seems like Ye Xiao didn't find it funny at all? Interacting with ordinary people is too difficult, perhaps only powerful experts like the Sword Immortal can communicate with him and resonate.</p><p></p><p>Letting out a slight sigh, Liu Chengxun bid farewell to Ye Xiao.</p><p></p><p>"If there's nothing else, then I'll head back to the dorm first, goodbye."</p><p></p><p>Ye Xiao looked at the map in his hand, a seemingly exquisite map that had been scribbled on and revised countless times - this guy must be doing this for ordinary people for the first time. "Old Liu."</p><p></p><p>Liu Chengxun paused, turning back to look at Ye Xiao.</p><p></p><p>"What did you call me?"</p><p></p><p>"That's how I and my friends address each other. If you find it offensive, I can call you Manager Liu instead."</p><p></p><p>Liu Chengxun was silent for a moment, then broke into a smile.</p><p></p><p>"You're a really interesting person."</p><p></p><p>Liu Chengxun was used to being high and mighty. For him, he was just trying to find the Sword Immortal, but due to his special identity and the fact that this was the Jiuzhou region, he couldn't just act on his own impulses.</p><p></p><p>That's why he was working at the Martial Arts Library, pretending to be an ordinary person to pass the time.</p><p></p><p>But in reality, he knew he could never truly be an ordinary person.</p><p></p><p>Whenever he greeted others, they would tremble in fear, whether it was his colleagues or the people coming to borrow books - they all maintained a respectful distance from him.</p><p></p><p>Even his own disciples would have a strong sense of awe towards him.</p><p></p><p>The divine and the human race had already become like two separate species.</p><p></p><p>But now, Liu Chengxun had found the unconventional Ye Xiao.</p><p></p><p>This guy could interact with him like an ordinary friend, a feeling that struck him as strange, but also quite comforting.</p><p></p><p>No wonder Jiansheng had recommended him to work at the library - if he were somewhere else, he definitely wouldn't have the chance to meet this interesting person.</p><p></p><p>It seems the time spent searching for the Sword Immortal in Jianghai City won't be too boring after all.</p><p></p><p>Ye Xiao waved the map in his hand.</p><p></p><p>"How about we go have a meal together? I said before, since you helped me analyze the map, I'll treat you to a meal."</p><p></p><p>"Eat a meal? Alright, it's been a long time since I've eaten as a divine being. Going for a meal won't hurt."</p><p></p><p>Ye Xiao nodded, then called out to the already retreating Yang Qian: "Yang Qian, do you want to join us?"</p><p></p><p>Yang Qian hurriedly shook her head.</p><p></p><p>"No, no, I still have work to do."</p><p></p><p>"Then we'll be going first."</p><p></p><p>Watching the two of them leave, Yang Qian quickly patted her chest, taking a few deep breaths.</p><p></p><p>"The Manager is really a weirdo, his mental state is just too strong! Staying with a divine being without a trace of fear. If I didn't know the Manager is only in his early twenties, I'd suspect he's a hidden big shot."</p><p></p><p>This was the reason why Ye Xiao was neither humble nor arrogant, not putting on any act.</p><p></p><p>He was only in his early twenties, and in just two more months, he would be twenty-one.</p><p></p><p>As long as someone's brain wasn't waterlogged, they wouldn't think he was a divine expert! They would just feel he was more casual and had a good temperament, which is why he got along well with Liu Chengxun.</p><p></p><p>The two of them walked and chatted.</p><p></p><p>"What do you want to eat?"</p><p></p><p>"Hmm, how about Hangzhou pickled vegetables?"</p><p></p><p>"There aren't many Hangzhou pickled vegetable shops around Jiuzhou, are there?"</p><p></p><p>"Is that so?"</p><p></p><p>"Of course, Hangzhou pickled vegetables were originally passed down from our Jiuzhou region. Jiuzhou has many types of pickled vegetables, both in taste and variety, that are far superior to Hangzhou pickled vegetables.</p><p></p><p>Since you're in Jiuzhou, if you don't eat Jiuzhou pickled vegetables and go for Hangzhou pickled vegetables instead, isn't that putting the cart before the horse?"</p><p></p><p>"Then I'll try Jiuzhou pickled vegetables today."</p><p></p><p>However, they had only walked a short distance when they passed by a small alley, and Liu Chengxun suddenly stopped in his tracks.</p><p></p><p>Ye Xiao had sensed it first - in the small alley, there were two early Xiantian-grade demihuman elites lying in wait.</p><p></p><p>"Hehehe, we were just worrying about not being able to find a lone library manager to inquire about the location of the Spirit Gathering Array's seal, and you two have conveniently delivered yourselves to us."</p><p></p><p>Ye Xiao was stunned - these two demihuman elites were really impressive! In the Jianghai City library, there were countless managers, yet they had managed to target the two divine-level experts in the entire city.</p><p></p><p>The probability was even lower than winning the lottery.</p><p></p><p>He glanced at Liu Chengxun.</p><p></p><p>"Old Liu, can't you intervene? Should we call the police?"</p><p></p><p>Liu Chengxun shook his head.</p><p></p><p>"According to the agreement I signed with the Jiuzhou higher-ups, I'm not allowed to act rashly. But if I encounter demihumans, beasts, or anyone with ill intent towards me, I'm allowed to intervene.</p><p></p><p>Please bear witness for me."</p><p></p><p>Here is my translation of the Chinese excerpt:</p><p></p><p>Ye Xiao nodded.</p><p></p><p>The two demihuman cultivators left peacefully.</p><p></p><p>Even though Liu Chengxun and Ye Xiao had battled, sustaining no small amount of injury, those two demihuman grand masters were still no match for them.</p><p></p><p>After all, Liu Chengxun was the Sword Saint of Hanzhou, ranked 49th on the World Dragon Ranking! With two sword beams, the two demihuman grand masters were cleaved into fragments, going to meet their beast gods.</p><p></p><p>Ye Xiao praised him, saying:</p><p></p><p>"Impressive, no wonder you are ranked 49th on the World Dragon Ranking. This technique is far beyond what ordinary people can compare to."</p><p></p><p>Liu Chengxun casually replied:</p><p></p><p>"I'm actually no longer ranked 49th, I'm now 50th."</p><p></p><p>Ye Xiao was taken aback, and Liu Chengxun explained:</p><p></p><p>"Dao Sword Immortal is now ranked 49th, having surpassed me. When that happened, the Dragon Ranking automatically adjusted, and all the rankings behind me shifted down one spot. </p><p>So now I'm 50th, and Munakata Hitsuji has been pushed out of the Dragon Ranking into 1st on the Tiger Ranking."</p><p></p><p>"I see."</p><p></p><p>The two continued on their way, and not long after they left, a figure suddenly appeared at the site, seeing the long sword marks on the ground and feeling a sense of dread.</p><p></p><p>"Such powerful sword marks, I can't believe Sword Saint Liu Chengxun of Hanzhou has become a librarian in this small coastal city. </p><p>Fortunately, I just sent my subordinates to investigate, and didn't come out myself."</p><p></p><p>After saying this, he glanced back at the library, a slight smile on his lips.</p><p></p><p>"Now that Liu Chengxun and his colleague have gone to eat, I can take this opportunity to investigate the whereabouts of the formation..."</p><p></p><p>Saying this, he transformed into a beam of light and strode boldly into the library.</p><p></p><p>With Innate 7th Rank strength, he could easily find a high-ranking staff member and get them to reveal the location of the Gathering Spirit Formation.</p><p></p><p>Soon he discovered that the Gathering Spirit Formation of Jianghai City was located under the statue of Dao Sword Immortal in front of the library.</p><p></p><p>This made him extremely delighted.</p><p></p><p>Standing before the statue, his gaze could no longer conceal a hint of joy.</p><p></p><p>"So the fragment of Noel Physis is sealed beneath this? </p><p>Aside from the major cities, the Saint Beast-level spirit beasts in all the other places have been divided and sealed, unable to assist me in advancing my cultivation.</p><p>Only Jianghai City has the peak Saint Realm, Innate 9th Rank Noel Physis' fragment, whose cultivation has already reached Innate 7th Rank Saint Realm.</p><p>As long as I enter this seal, and use the Beast Soul Incense given to me by the Alliance Master, I can easily weaken the other's spiritual power, and then devour it, using its bloodline power to refine my own spirit beast bloodline, allowing me to completely become a noble spirit beast.</p><p>Once that happens, and I cultivate together with the Alliance Master, I will surely be able to quickly advance to Innate 8th Rank."</p><p></p><p>Just as he finished speaking, a voice suddenly sounded.</p><p></p><p>"Who's standing there?"</p><p></p><p>A bright flashlight beam shot over, and the security guard had discovered the Left Protector's figure.</p><p></p><p>But the Left Protector merely snorted coldly, raising a hand to unleash a qi attack that effortlessly reduced the guard to rubble.</p><p></p><p>"Looking for death!"</p><p></p><p>He spat, then looked at the statue and took out a special weapon from his pocket. Holding this weapon, he actually directly sank into the ground.</p><p></p><p>The little security guard wasn't afraid, but his time was limited, because as soon as Liu Chengxun finished eating, he would definitely return.</p><p>At that point, it would become a real problem.</p><p></p><p>This weapon was a gift from the Alliance Master, forged from the core of a spirit beast that could burrow underground, imbued with spiritual energy to grant it the ability to phase through the earth.</p><p>With it, he could easily sink into the ground without alerting anyone.</p><p></p><p>"The thing the Alliance Master gave me is really useful.</p><p>With this weapon, I bet I can even penetrate their sealing formation.</p><p>After I obtain Noel Physis' fragment, I'll definitely go back and report to the Alliance Master, dedicating myself to her for seven days and nights!"</p><p></p><p>"Duang!"</p><p></p><p>"Ouch, what the hell is this so hard?"</p><p></p><p>The Left Protector clutched his head, the pain excruciating.</p><p>Whatever he had just run into was unbelievably hard, even his Innate 7th Rank body reinforced by martial arts couldn't withstand it.</p><p></p><p>He rubbed his head hard, circulating his spiritual energy, and only when the pain had subsided a bit did he start to re-examine the situation.</p><p>When he saw what was in front of him, he was utterly shocked.</p><p></p><p>"Such a powerful formation! This formation is actually at the Imperial Realm level! Heavens, no wonder it's used to seal the fragment of Innate 7th Rank Noel Physis.</p><p>The scale of this is truly impressive, no wonder I couldn't break through. </p><p></p><p>But his mouth soon curled up in a slight smile again.</p><p></p><p>"However, although this is an Imperial Realm formation, it doesn't seem to use any spirit stones, it's just a simple engraving of the formation. If it had used spirit stones, I definitely wouldn't be able to do anything, and would have to return empty-handed.</p><p>Now, as long as I use the Imperial Rank Disruptive Treasure given to me by the Alliance Master to open a temporary hole in the formation for a few minutes, I can definitely get in and take Noel Physis!"</p>

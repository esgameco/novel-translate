        <h1>Chapter 292</h1>
        <div class="content">
            <p>Here is the full English translation of the Chinese novel excerpt:</p><p></p><p>But today's Silver Fox Valley was not as peaceful as yesterday, but rather a bit noisy.</p><p></p><p>Early in the morning, Ye Xiao heard some whimpering sounds coming from the neighboring VIP building.</p><p></p><p>"Sister Jade Rabbit was still fine yesterday, but why did she suddenly disappear today?"</p><p></p><p>"That's right, Sister Jade Rabbit is a Celestial Saint Realm cultivator, how could she just suddenly vanish?"</p><p></p><p>"Sisters, don't worry, regarding this matter, our Silver Fox Clan will definitely get to the bottom of it and give everyone an explanation."</p><p></p><p>This was the Fox Queen comforting them.</p><p></p><p>While chewing on a rabbit leg, Ye Xiao was pondering a question - the number of star beasts in the starry sky far exceeds the number in the human world, and now it is because the star beasts have absolute superiority in strength, which has caused a huge impact on the human race, making them fear the star beasts and become their prey.</p><p></p><p>But what if the situation was reversed? If the strength of the human race surpassed the star beasts, would that change the current relationship between humans and star beasts? Making the human race the hunters and the star beasts the prey? If that were the case, the strength of the human race would increase significantly, would they have enough opportunities to fully evolve the divine blood?</p><p></p><p>If that were the case, turning a group of weaklings into a group of powerhouses, turning a losing hand into a winning one.</p><p></p><p>At that time, there would be no need for him to step forward, the human race could stand proudly in the starry sky on their own.</p><p></p><p>And he could just live his carefree and happy life, undisturbed by anyone, reading books, tending to flowers and plants, and caring for small animals every day.</p><p></p><p>Thinking about it this way, it would be much more profitable and safer than him stepping in every time the human race encountered danger.</p><p></p><p>Moreover, Ye Xiao himself was not the type who liked trouble, if the human race could grow stronger, his troubles would be greatly reduced.</p><p></p><p>Most importantly, in the starry sky, there are countless powerhouses, and after the star beasts, there will surely be even more powerful enemies.</p><p></p><p>If he doesn't plan ahead, when that time comes, the human race will really be unable to make any waves.</p><p></p><p>"Master, are you awake?"</p><p></p><p>At this time, Ning Yuthen's voice came from downstairs. Ye Xiao put the rabbit leg he hadn't finished eating back into his storage ring, and then replied, "I'm awake, come up."</p><p></p><p>"Okay."</p><p></p><p>Ning Yuthen responded, carrying a wooden box and walked upstairs with a smile.</p><p></p><p>"Master, you've been eating breakfast every day in the mortal world, so I'm not sure if you'll get used to it if you don't have breakfast here. I had the kitchen make you some exquisite breakfast dishes."</p><p></p><p>"Thank you."</p><p></p><p>"Master, why are you so polite to me? Oh right, I feel like I can smell something fragrant here, like the scent of roasted meat."</p><p></p><p>"Is it possible you smelled it wrong? How could I have roasted meat here?"</p><p></p><p>"That's true. Master, come try it! These are all dishes that I had them try their best to simulate the breakfast on the mortal world. See if the taste is to your liking."</p><p></p><p>Ning Yuthen took out the breakfast, which was several very delicate breakfast dishes, all made from heavenly materials and treasures, not ordinary grains.</p><p></p><p>Not only would the taste be better, but it could also supplement spiritual energy, which was a very good nutritious meal for cultivators.</p><p></p><p>Ye Xiao took a taste.</p><p></p><p>"It's quite good."</p><p></p><p>Ning Yuthen showed a happy smile.</p><p></p><p>"I'm glad you like it, Master."</p><p></p><p>After a pause, he spoke again:</p><p></p><p>"By the way, it's a bit noisy downstairs today, I hope it didn't disturb your rest, Master."</p><p></p><p>Ye Xiao shook his head.</p><p></p><p>"It's fine, but what's going on down there? Why are they making so much noise so early in the morning?"</p><p></p><p>A trace of impatience flashed in Ning Yuthen's eyes.</p><p></p><p>"It's still those green tea beauties. One of them, the Celestial Saint Realm cultivator Binglu Yuluo, mysteriously disappeared this morning. We've searched the entire Silver Fox Valley, but can't find her anywhere.</p><p></p><p>They're making a fuss about it now."</p><p></p><p>After a pause, he continued:</p><p></p><p>"But to be honest, I've never liked them. They came here this time, obviously just wanting to get their hands on the human Emperor's inheritance. </p><p></p><p>Now one of them has mysteriously disappeared, who knows what kind of tricks they're trying to pull. </p><p></p><p>Maybe she's hiding herself, and then wants to use this opportunity to find fault, so that others will search the Silver Fox Valley and she can find the human Emperor's inheritance."</p><p></p><p>Ye Xiao nodded.</p><p></p><p>"You've made a good analysis. Your progress is evident."</p><p></p><p>Receiving Ye Xiao's praise, Ning Yuthen was very happy.</p><p></p><p>"Of course, how could I let down the master I've been following? I have to make sure I don't embarrass you."</p><p></p><p>Ye Xiao lightly hummed in response, then couldn't help but ask, "By the way, this is your Silver Fox Clan's territory, so how come they're being so unruly?"</p><p></p><p>Ning Yuthen smiled bitterly.</p><p></p><p>"It's not that simple. After all, we're all star beasts, belonging to the same star beast group, so we still have to follow certain rules.</p><p></p><p>Otherwise, if they report this to the beast god in charge of this area, or even to the higher supreme gods, we'll be in big trouble."</p><p></p><p>Ye Xiao understood a bit.</p><p></p><p>Although they can solve minor matters on their own, they have to be cautious when it comes to major issues, just like in international diplomacy. If they handle it poorly, they may easily provoke the ruling class of star beasts to suppress them, and that would be a real headache.</p><p></p><p>After a pause, Ning Yuthen continued...</p><p></p><p>Here is my translation of the Chinese excerpt:</p><p></p><p>"Speaking of which, Manager, if you need any precious materials, just let me know. While you're here in the Silver Fox Valley, you should take the opportunity to break through to the next level. I'll do my best to help you. With an increase in your cultivation, you'll be safer when dealing with the beast disasters."</p><p></p><p>Ye Xiao nodded.</p><p></p><p>But just then, a commotion suddenly arose downstairs. </p><p></p><p>The two men furrowed their brows, and Ning Yuhen's expression turned cold.</p><p></p><p>"Manager, let me go down and take a look. What are these despicable creatures up to?"</p><p></p><p>Ye Xiao nodded. </p><p></p><p>"I'll come with you to take a look."</p><p></p><p>"Okay!"</p><p></p><p>When they reached the first floor, they saw the Fox Empress standing at the door, blocking several star beasts, who were stubbornly refusing to leave.</p><p></p><p>"Grandmother, what's going on?" Ning Yuhen couldn't help but ask.</p><p></p><p>Before the Fox Empress could speak, the wolf demon among them spoke up first: "Last night, our companion Lianluoyu Rabbit disappeared on your Silver Fox Valley's territory. Ning Shengzi should know about this, right?"</p><p></p><p>Ning Yuhen nodded.</p><p></p><p>The wolf demon spoke again: "Sister Fox Empress, you've already agreed to let us inspect the Silver Fox Valley. Except for the forbidden areas, we can check everywhere else. We've checked all the other places, and this is the only one left. I hope Ning Shengzi can do us this favor."</p><p></p><p>"Absolutely not!" Ning Yuhen directly refused.</p><p></p><p>What a joke! Ye Xiao was the person he respected the most, and he would not allow these star beasts to search Ye Xiao's room - that would be disrespecting Ye Xiao.</p><p></p><p>"Manager Ye is my honored guest, and I absolutely will not allow anyone to search his room."</p><p></p><p>"Ning Shengzi, what do you mean? Are you trying to cover for him?" </p><p></p><p>Ning Yuhen sneered: "Don't put words in my mouth. Lianluoyu Rabbit's strength is far beyond mine. If she was really here, she would have come out long ago. What's the use of you searching?"</p><p></p><p>Ye Xiao also understood that the reason they wanted to search here was because they all knew that Lianluoyu Rabbit had come looking for him the previous night. </p><p></p><p>So this matter had also confirmed Ning Yuhen's guess - they were here for the inheritance of the Human Immortal Realm.</p><p></p><p>If it were at any other time, he would have directly sent these fellows to the underworld with a single sword. </p><p></p><p>But now, this was the Silver Fox Clan's territory, and he was just a guest. There was no need to be overbearing, so he could leave it to Ning Yuhen and the others.</p><p></p><p>The star beasts were obviously very dissatisfied, but didn't know what else to say, so they could only turn their gaze to the Fox Empress.</p><p></p><p>The Fox Empress smiled faintly, "Yuhen is also right. If Yuji sister was really here, she would have come out long ago. Let's go check other places."</p><p></p><p>Since the decision-maker of the Silver Fox Valley had spoken, there was nothing more to argue about.</p><p></p><p>The star beasts could only leave in resentment.</p><p></p><p>"Today we've searched the entire Silver Fox Valley, but there's still no result. I hope Sister Fox Empress can get to the bottom of this matter soon, so that we can rest assured."</p><p></p><p>The Fox Empress smiled slightly. </p><p></p><p>"Don't worry, Yuji sister and I are good sisters. I will definitely keep this matter in mind. Sisters, please go back first."</p><p></p><p>The star beasts left with resentment.</p><p></p><p>Ning Yuhen sneered, "A bunch of idiots, thinking that with the backing of the divine beasts, they can run amok in the Silver Fox Valley? They're really too arrogant."</p><p></p><p>The Fox Empress shook her head, somewhat helplessly.</p><p></p><p>"You don't have to talk big. At least the Silver Fox Valley hasn't been able to withstand the existence of a divine beast yet."</p><p></p><p>"A divine beast will soon appear in the Silver Fox Valley. That divine beast will be me! After I obtain the inheritance of the Immortal Realm, I will definitely ascend to godhood!"</p><p></p><p>"Okay, okay, then you'd better hurry up and cultivate, strive to advance to the divine beast realm as soon as possible?"</p><p></p><p>Ning Yuhen nodded, bid farewell to Ye Xiao, and left.</p><p></p><p>The star beasts returned to their rooms, their faces turning dark with anger.</p><p></p><p>"I bet the disappearance of Yuji sister is definitely related to that guy. We just don't know what the exact relationship is. Logically speaking, his cultivation doesn't seem to be that high, so he shouldn't be able to do anything to Yuji sister. Could it be that this Lianluoyu Rabbit, after receiving the information, didn't want to share it with us, so she secretly hid it? </p><p></p><p>Or maybe she has reached some kind of agreement with the Silver Fox Clan, so she's deliberately hiding, not wanting us to know. </p><p></p><p>After we leave, they'll make a move on that treasure trove, right?"</p><p></p><p>"No, we can't let them take all the benefits. Tonight, we must go and question that human again."</p><p></p><p>"But we don't know the situation, Yuji has already disappeared. If we go again and another star beast goes missing, what should we do?"</p><p></p><p>The crane stood up.</p><p></p><p>"Since it's like this, then we'll send a powerful star beast to go. Tonight, I'll go and meet him!"</p><p></p><p>This is a one-update chapter, 3,000 words.</p><p></p><p>Please recommend votes and monthly votes. </p><p></p><p>Thank you to book friends 20200719001823579, 常乐, 巫满云山, and 幻小梦 for their donations, greatly appreciated.</p><p></p><p>(This chapter is complete)</p>

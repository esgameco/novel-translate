        <h1>Chapter 206</h1>
        <div class="content">
            <p>Here is the full English translation of the Chinese novel excerpt:</p><p></p><p>The Dragon Slayer who was preparing to attack suddenly stopped his movements and looked up towards the southwest sky.</p><p></p><p>He narrowed his eyes slightly.</p><p></p><p>"So you've finally come, huh? Hmph! I thought you were going to keep hiding like a turtle forever."</p><p></p><p>After a brief pause, he let out an unconcerned snort.</p><p></p><p>"But even if you've come, it won't make any difference."</p><p></p><p>With that, he redirected his attack from Jianghai City towards the southwest direction.</p><p></p><p>Dark clouds formed into a demonic dragon, roaring as it charged towards the southwest, the dark clouds on its body surging with a faint reddish glow.</p><p></p><p>The overwhelming power caused the heavens and earth to tremble.</p><p></p><p>Meanwhile, in the southwest direction, golden light began to spread out, like sharp swords descending straight towards the demonic dragon.</p><p></p><p>These golden lights sliced through the cloud layers, finally revealing what lay within.</p><p></p><p>It was a massive golden Buddha palm! </p><p></p><p>Towering higher than the mountains, its might was boundless.</p><p></p><p>This was Ye Xiao's Tathagata Palm! Facing these two supreme attacks from the sky, all the martial artists in Jianghai City found it difficult to withstand.</p><p></p><p>Previously, when Ye Xiao had fought against Liu Chengxun and Munakata Hitoshi, the impact was only felt along the riverbank.</p><p></p><p>But now, Ye Xiao's confrontation with the Dragon Slayer was able to encompass and affect the entire Jianghai City. </p><p></p><p>This battle was on a completely different scale compared to the previous one.</p><p></p><p>As the two forces drew closer, the oppressive aura caused the clouds between heaven and earth to part.</p><p></p><p>One second! Two seconds!</p><p></p><p>Three seconds!</p><p></p><p>Under the gaze of millions of citizens, the demonic dragon finally collided with the Tathagata Palm.</p><p></p><p>Without a sound, the brilliant light directly consumed the entire sky, even swallowing the sun.</p><p></p><p>The power was so overwhelming, the shockwaves exceeded the speed of sound. When the shockwaves reached the ground, the violent winds pinned everyone down, and they had not even heard the sound yet.</p><p></p><p>"Such dazzling light! Ah, my eyes are being blinded!"</p><p></p><p>"Is it Senior Swordmaster who has taken action? The old master has finally made a move!"</p><p></p><p>"Senior Swordmaster can also use palm techniques? Heavens, Senior Swordmaster is the best!"</p><p></p><p>"As expected of Senior Swordmaster, his strike causes the heavens to shake and the earth to tremble!"</p><p></p><p>The entire explosion process lasted for dozens of seconds before gradually subsiding.</p><p></p><p>At this point, many people whose eyes had been damaged by the intense light had not yet fully recovered their vision.</p><p></p><p>However, some of the stronger martial artists had already regained their sight, and they strained their eyes, desperately trying to be the first to see the outcome of the battle.</p><p></p><p>In the sky, two massive cloud formations had formed, with a vacant space in between.</p><p></p><p>This was because the explosion caused by the two combatants' techniques had divided the cloud layers to both sides.</p><p></p><p>At this time, one side of the clouds was a normal color, while the other side was pure black, with faint traces of blood-red, appearing extremely ominous.</p><p></p><p>Du Changfeng and the others couldn't help but speak up:</p><p></p><p>"Senior Swordmaster, did you just end up in a stalemate with the Dragon Slayer?"</p><p></p><p>Fa Zheng and the others were extremely anxious.</p><p></p><p>"From the current situation, it seems to be the case."</p><p></p><p>Yue Xinling and Lian Chiming shook their heads, feeling somewhat exasperated by these people.</p><p></p><p>What do they mean by just a stalemate? The Dragon Slayer was a powerhouse of such a high level! He had been renowned throughout the Nine Prefectures, striking fear into the hearts of all.</p><p></p><p>And the Swordmaster had only recently emerged, yet he was able to match the Dragon Slayer in battle, reaching a stalemate. This was already an extraordinary feat.</p><p></p><p>Although the Swordmaster had previously been able to easily defeat the Three-Headed Divine Beast of the Su Shan Sect, that was because they were only at the Innate Eighth Rank.</p><p></p><p>The Swordmaster was at the Innate Ninth Rank, so he could easily dominate them.</p><p></p><p>But the Innate Ninth Rank also had distinctions between early and late stages.</p><p></p><p>The Dragon Slayer had not yet broken through to the Divine Monarch Realm, but his cultivation was far beyond the ordinary Innate Ninth Rank.</p><p></p><p>Given this situation, as long as the Swordmaster could hold off the Dragon Slayer, waiting for other powerful experts from the Nine Prefectures to arrive and assist, this crisis would be completely resolved.</p><p></p><p>In the sky, the Dragon Slayer couldn't help but raise the corner of his mouth in a slight smile.</p><p></p><p>"Interesting, you've piqued my interest a bit."</p><p></p><p>That his opponent could block his full-power strike was indeed worthy of being his match.</p><p></p><p>It seems this time, before facing the Sword Immortal Li Liushui, he wouldn't be too bored, and could warm up in advance.</p><p></p><p>"Next, let me see your true face."</p><p></p><p>Before the Dragon Slayer could finish speaking, the cloud formation on the other side had begun to gradually dissipate, revealing countless golden palm shadows within - all of them comparable to the previous Tathagata Palm!</p><p></p><p>Countless Tathagata Palms! This Swordmaster was actually this powerful.</p><p></p><p>No, this was not the time to be thinking about that.</p><p></p><p>Counterattack quickly! The Dragon Slayer dared not be the slightest bit careless, immediately mobilizing all the power in his body to form several black dragons charging towards Ye Xiao's cloud formation.</p><p></p><p>In the next moment, the Tathagata Palms within Ye Xiao's cloud formation also launched their attack! Boom, boom, boom, boom, boom. The Tathagata Palms were like a Gatling gun, frantically firing towards the Dragon Slayer's cloud formation.</p><p></p><p>Countless massive light shadows exploded within the black cloud formation.</p><p></p><p>Powerful shockwaves continued to transmit from the sky, suppressing the martial artists below in Jianghai City, rendering them unable to move.</p><p></p><p>But they could still physically withstand the pressure for now.</p><p></p><p>However, the spiritual impact was something they could not endure at all.</p><p></p><p>Here is the full English translation of the Chinese excerpt:</p><p></p><p>They knew that Senior Sword Immortal's strength was very powerful, but they never expected his strength to be to this extent!</p><p></p><p>From the initial Sect Master, to the later Grand Sect Master, and then to the Divine Sect Master.</p><p></p><p>From the Sword Saint of Han Prefecture, Liu Chengxun, to the current Dragon Slayer!</p><p></p><p>Senior Sword Immortal, each time he was able to refresh their cognition. Where exactly is his limit?</p><p></p><p>The most tragic one was the Dragon Slayer. At this moment, facing Ye Xiao's frenzied assault, he finally realized that he was wrong. And he was wrong in a very absurd way.</p><p></p><p>He should never have come here, and he should not even have had the idea of provoking this Sword Immortal.</p><p></p><p>He is too terrifying!</p><p></p><p>In his entire life, he has never been so afraid of anyone.</p><p></p><p>Even the Sword Deity Li Liushui who defeated him originally, was far from reaching this level.</p><p></p><p>After closing his eyes for arduous cultivation for a full seventy years, he still had the confidence to challenge Li Liushui.</p><p></p><p>But facing the Sword Immortal, he was truly scared, scared to the extreme.</p><p></p><p>This is simply an invincible powerhouse.</p><p></p><p>"Ah ah ah ah..."</p><p></p><p>Facing the last moment of his life, he aroused an endless desire to survive.</p><p></p><p>At this moment, he no longer thought about being able to defeat the Sword Immortal, he only wanted to live.</p><p></p><p>Get through this calamity! But unfortunately, Ye Xiao would never agree to that.</p><p></p><p>When he left the Jianghai City to go to the Southwest Forest Sea to take care of some matters, this guy actually came to attack Jianghai City?</p><p></p><p>How is this any different from stealing his home? He even wanted to kill him! Kill him!</p><p></p><p>The Dharma Sutra was running at full power, the Tathagata Divine Palm was frantically firing, the powerful energy, endlessly bombarding the Dragon Slayer, finally making him unable to bear it.</p><p></p><p>Boom! A palm broke through his protective aura.</p><p></p><p>A palm shattered his Imperial Soldier Armor.</p><p></p><p>A palm annihilated his body.</p><p></p><p>A palm completely destroyed his soul.</p><p></p><p>After a loud explosion, the vast black cloud completely dissipated.</p><p></p><p>The sky restored to clarity, a golden giant Buddha stood at the top of the clouds.</p><p></p><p>Like the true Buddha descending to the world.</p><p></p><p>Countless people of Jianghai City shed excited tears.</p><p></p><p>Won, they finally won! They don't have to die!</p><p></p><p>From a group of fish on the chopping board, to surviving unscathed, this sense of survival after a calamity is more satisfying than anything else.</p><p></p><p>As for the Beastmen, they were completely dumbfounded.</p><p></p><p>"The Overlord... the Overlord is dead! The old Overlord is dead!"</p><p></p><p>"Run quickly!"</p><p></p><p>Dou Changfeng reacted immediately and shouted loudly, "Don't let them escape, kill them all, not a single one left."</p><p></p><p>These Beastmen are all hidden dangers and must be completely eliminated.</p><p></p><p>But unfortunately, there were too many Beastmen, and they couldn't slaughter them all at the moment.</p><p></p><p>At this time, Ye Xiao up in the sky acted again.</p><p></p><p>"Sword, come!"</p><p></p><p>Saying "Sword, come", ten thousand sword beams appeared, like countless golden dragons dancing in the sky, falling down from above.</p><p></p><p>The golden sword beams were so numerous that from a visual perspective, it almost looked like a waterfall falling from the nine heavens.</p><p></p><p>Boom boom boom boom, each sword beam precisely tracked down a Beastman and ruthlessly slaughtered them.</p><p></p><p>In the blink of an eye, all the Beastmen who came to Jianghai City were annihilated.</p><p></p><p>From then on, there was no more Beastmen Alliance in this world.</p><p></p><p>All of them were slaughtered by Ye Xiao.</p><p></p><p>But this is not the end yet.</p><p></p><p>Because of the arrival of the Beastmen Alliance this time, many warriors were injured, and there were even many people on the verge of death or even truly dead.</p><p></p><p>Ye Xiao activated his two major cultivation methods, the three major healing arts, and the pure golden energy erupted from his entire body, illuminating him into a semi-transparent golden color.</p><p></p><p>The light fell to the ground, and all the injured were quickly healed and restored to their original state.</p><p></p><p>After completing all this, Ye Xiao finally stopped, and with a thought, he disappeared into the clouds.</p><p></p><p>This battle has come to an end.</p><p></p><p>But the cheers of the people have only just begun.</p><p></p><p>"Long live Senior Sword Immortal!"</p><p>"Senior Sword Immortal, I want to give you a baby monkey."</p><p>"Senior Sword Immortal, I love you to death!"</p><p></p><p>It was almost a complete celebration, everyone was praising Ye Xiao.</p><p></p><p>The entire Jianghai City was proud of the Sword Immortal.</p><p></p><p>Luo Xinlian, Lian Chimore and other super experts were also dumbfounded.</p><p></p><p>Won? He won just like that.</p><p></p><p>And he won thoroughly, without the slightest bit of damage.</p><p></p><p>And the entire process took less than a minute!</p><p></p><p>In the end, the Sword Immortal even healed all the injured and revived all the dead.</p><p></p><p>The Beastmen Alliance came with great fanfare, sparing no effort, and invited the old Overlord Dragon Slayer, but they ended up with a lonely defeat!</p><p></p><p>After a long time, Lian Chimore finally came to his senses and couldn't help but sigh, "Senior Sword Immortal, truly a divine person!"</p>

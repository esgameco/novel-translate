        <h1>Chapter 40</h1>
        <div class="content">
            <p>Here is the full English translation of the Chinese excerpt:</p><p></p><p>"Missed the mark? It seems the previous adjustment wasn't good enough, let's try again."</p><p></p><p>With a thought, dozens of sword beams formed around his body again. After infusing them with spiritual power, they shot forth with thunderous force, quickly catching up to the Illusory Glass.</p><p></p><p>Soon, the sound of thunderous explosions echoed from the front.</p><p></p><p>And the agonizing cries of the Illusory Glass kept coming.</p><p></p><p>"Master, let's stop playing now!"</p><p></p><p>"Please stop, someone's going to die! They'll really die!"</p><p></p><p>"Ahhh—!"</p><p></p><p>An hour later, Ye Xiao placed the Illusory Glass, now covered in plaster, on the sofa and began summarizing the attack tests he had just conducted.</p><p></p><p>He meticulously compared and tested every aspect, including the spiritual power infused in each attack, the spiritual energy required, the detonation speed and location of each attack.</p><p></p><p>Thanks to the Supremely Profound Heavenly Formation, he didn't need to record and calculate everything on paper. He could simply sweep his spiritual power through his memories to retrieve the optimal test results.</p><p></p><p>In the future, he could directly apply the calculated proportions whenever he used these attacks!</p><p></p><p>After completing the calculations, a slight smile appeared on Ye Xiao's face, and he felt quite pleased.</p><p></p><p>This research was entirely his own work, not relying on the Godly Book's soul fusion, so he felt a sense of accomplishment.</p><p></p><p>However, when he saw the Illusory Glass, Ye Xiao fell silent again.</p><p></p><p>The Illusory Glass's injuries made him think of something.</p><p></p><p>That was the issue of self-preservation.</p><p></p><p>Although his cultivation was relatively strong, he was not invincible!</p><p></p><p>If he were to get injured, that would be quite troublesome. Once injured, his attack power and defense would plummet, making it easy for him to die.</p><p></p><p>No, he needed to find a solution.</p><p></p><p>He had previously considered a few options:</p><p></p><p>One was to learn forging techniques, using the creation of weapons and armor to enhance his defense and amplify his attacks.</p><p></p><p>The second was to learn alchemy, using medicinal pills to quickly heal injuries, while also accelerating his cultivation progress and boosting his temporary combat power.</p><p></p><p>The third was to learn healing techniques, using healing arts to recover from injuries.</p><p></p><p>Each of these options had its own advantages.</p><p></p><p>Forging techniques provide a long-term solution. Once a set of defensive equipment is forged, it can be used anytime, anywhere, to instantly defend against even unexpected attacks, as the armor only needs to be worn.</p><p></p><p>But it also has a drawback - if the equipment is damaged in battle, it becomes unusable and needs to be repaired afterward.</p><p></p><p>Alchemy can restore injuries the fastest. Once medicinal pills are refined and kept on hand, they can be consumed to quickly heal injuries, and can be used multiple times.</p><p></p><p>The downside is that "medicine has three parts poison," and excessive consumption can accumulate toxins in the meridians, requiring future cleansing.</p><p></p><p>Healing techniques have the slowest effect and consume a large amount of spiritual energy.</p><p></p><p>Among these three types of techniques, Ye Xiao already had a foundation in four forging techniques, six alchemy techniques, and two healing techniques.</p><p></p><p>While he didn't know how many base techniques were required to fuse each type, forging and alchemy were likely to be the fastest to synthesize.</p><p></p><p>This is because if a type has more base techniques, it means more people have developed techniques in that field, indicating it is more prosperous and easier to find base techniques.</p><p></p><p>In fact, those martial artists who go out to hunt star beasts would rather have armor, weapons, and medicinal pills than a healer, because damaged armor can be repaired, and pills can be repurchased, but a dead healer is hard to replace.</p><p></p><p>Here is the full English translation of the Chinese excerpt:</p><p></p><p>After realizing these things, Ye Xiao's gaze gradually became more determined, and he had an idea.</p><p></p><p>"Okay! It's decided, from today on, I will cultivate the healing art!"</p><p></p><p>There's no other choice.</p><p></p><p>The forging technique and alchemy, those are the toys of the rich, requiring cash to play with!</p><p></p><p>His financial situation does not allow for that.</p><p></p><p>If his identity was exposed, he might receive a large sum of money. </p><p></p><p>But in that case, he would also be in greater danger.</p><p></p><p>He might be sent to the frontlines to fight the star beasts, or be taken away for research, to see what his divine soul is and if his body structure is different! The latter is something Ye Xiao absolutely cannot accept, and as for the former, Ye Xiao's way of cultivation is to read books and become stronger, unlike others who rely on hunting star beasts and fighting to enhance their strength, so if he leaves the library, it would actually be less convenient for him.</p><p></p><p>Therefore, no matter what, he cannot expose his identity.</p><p></p><p>At least until he becomes a peak Saint Sovereign, his identity must be kept secret.</p><p></p><p>In summary, the only thing suitable for him now is to cultivate the healing art.</p><p></p><p>Looking on the bright side, this is not bad either.</p><p></p><p>On one hand, healing arts have zero consumption, able to treat even the most severe injuries with just two big bowls of white rice.</p><p></p><p>On the other hand, he has cultivated the Purple Jade Star Sea Technique, which is a combination of several basic heart techniques! The Purple Jade Star Sea absorbs spiritual energy at an extremely fast rate, enough to make up for the consumption of the cultivation technique!</p><p></p><p>It can be considered unparalleled! After realizing this, Ye Xiao then entered a blissful dream.</p><p></p><p>After all the lights in the house were turned off, Huan Liuli finally got up from the sofa, transforming into a human form, gritting her teeth and saying, "Damn Ye Xiao! Stinky Ye Xiao! He actually beat me so badly, if I don't take revenge, I'll take his surname!"</p><p></p><p>She took off her small leather shoes, stepped in her white stockings, and carefully climbed upstairs to Ye Xiao's room.</p><p></p><p>This room was originally hers, but ever since Ye Xiao arrived, he had ruthlessly occupied it.</p><p></p><p>Seeing Ye Xiao already lying on the bed and asleep, Huan Liuli took a deep breath and let out a sinister smile.</p><p></p><p>Subsequently, her small delicate hands reached towards Ye Xiao's clothes by the bed.</p><p></p><p>"Let's see if I can't poke holes in all your clothes! Let's see you go to work tomorrow, bare-assed!"</p><p></p><p>The moment this idea formed, the room's light was suddenly turned on, and the lying Ye Xiao stared fixatedly at Huan Liuli.</p><p></p><p>"What are you trying to do?"</p><p></p><p>Huan Liuli was drenched in cold sweat! Ye Xiao's gaze was so sharp, as if it could pierce through one's heart.</p><p></p><p>Fortunately for Huan Liuli, at that moment, a mosquito flew between the two of them, buzzing.</p><p></p><p>Slap—! Huan Liuli directly swatted it dead, then said seriously:</p><p></p><p>"Master, I felt a mosquito trying to disturb your rest, so I came to swat the mosquito for you."</p><p></p><p>"It's rare of you to be considerate. Since you're already here, go wash my clothes. But if even a single thread on my clothes is missing or if they have any strange smells, I will pluck all your fur and make new ones."</p><p></p><p>"Ahaha, how could that be? I'm the best at washing clothes! Master, don't worry, I'll make sure you can wear them tomorrow morning."</p><p></p><p>"Mm, go now, keep your voice down, I'm going to sleep."</p><p></p><p>"Yes!"</p><p></p><p>This is the end of the chapter.</p>

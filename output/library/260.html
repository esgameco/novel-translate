        <h1>Chapter 260</h1>
        <div class="content">
            <p>Here is the full English translation of the Chinese excerpt:</p><p></p><p>"That person just now, he should be a human, right?" </p><p></p><p>The captain couldn't help but murmur.</p><p></p><p>The others silently followed and spoke up:</p><p></p><p>"Couldn't see clearly, he was shrouded in a golden light, so we couldn't make out his face."</p><p></p><p>"But he's probably human. He seems to look like a human - one nose, two eyes, two arms, two legs. More or less the same as us.</p><p></p><p>And if he was a star beast, he should have killed all of us. How could he just leave us alone?"</p><p></p><p>"But why wouldn't the things he did be done by a human?"</p><p></p><p>On Ye Xiao's side, in the blink of an eye, he had returned to the Jianghai City.</p><p></p><p>This trip to the Southwest Forest Sea had allowed him to collect a large amount of heavenly materials and earthly treasures, all of which were the finest of the finest.</p><p></p><p>It should be enough for these star beasts to use.</p><p></p><p>However, Ye Xiao also had a concern - although the quantity of these heavenly materials and earthly treasures was large, they were ultimately limited.</p><p></p><p>Once one is consumed, there is one less.</p><p></p><p>The star beasts he was raising, not only would their numbers not decrease, but they would continue to increase.</p><p></p><p>If that was the case, these heavenly materials and earthly treasures might not last very long.</p><p></p><p>The Southwest Forest Sea could not create another batch of the same heavenly materials and earthly treasures in a short period of time.</p><p></p><p>The growth cycle of these things is really too long, otherwise they would not have such powerful nutrition.</p><p></p><p>It's not like raising pigs that can be slaughtered in three months.</p><p></p><p>Moreover, apart from the Southwest Forest Sea, there are not many places in the Nine Provinces that have so many resources.</p><p></p><p>In fact, it can be said that it is difficult to find such resources anywhere in the world.</p><p></p><p>This won't do, he has just reached the King Realm cultivation, if the resource supply is insufficient, how can he accelerate his future cultivation?</p><p></p><p>It must be known that with the increase in cultivation, the time, effort, and resources required for each advancement increase exponentially.</p><p></p><p>The reason why he has been able to advance quickly all this time is entirely due to the fact that he has absorbed and plundered a large amount of star beast resources.</p><p></p><p>Relying solely on resources, he would be far from reaching this level.</p><p></p><p>Without resources, he would be done for.</p><p></p><p>He needs to come up with a solution.</p><p></p><p>Should he open up another farm? That's a pretty good idea.</p><p></p><p>Only by taking matters into his own hands can one be well-fed.</p><p></p><p>However, when establishing a farm, the issue of land must be considered.</p><p></p><p>The star beast breeding ground he has set up can be arranged in the basement of the library, without occupying any space, and it will not be discovered by others.</p><p></p><p>But the star beast breeding ground is arranged there because they only need to be provided with spiritual energy.</p><p></p><p>Heavenly materials and earthly treasures won't work, in addition to needing a large amount of spiritual energy, they also need to constantly absorb the essence of the sun and moon in order to mature quickly.</p><p></p><p>This requires a surface-level land.</p><p></p><p>And to grow so many things, the required land area will definitely not be small.</p><p></p><p>In fact, the land he previously used to plant those flowers may not even be enough.</p><p></p><p>To do it this way, it would be a bit unprofitable.</p><p></p><p>At this moment, Ye Xiao's gaze fell on his ring.</p><p></p><p>The spatial storage ring.</p><p></p><p>Shrinking the space, that's it! He can completely add a thing into the power of space, refine it into a spatial treasure, and then engrave a formation on it to absorb the spiritual energy of heaven and earth and the essence of the sun and moon, wouldn't that allow him to grow a large amount of heavenly materials and earthly treasures? And it can also be carried around conveniently, easy to hide, without worrying about anyone discovering it.</p><p></p><p>It's perfect! Tomorrow, he'll give Wang Dalong a call and ask him to help search for some obsidian.</p><p></p><p>The spatial ring he snatched from the Ferocious Beast Alliance Leader's hand has things that can be used to plant heavenly materials and earthly treasures, but it lacks obsidian.</p><p></p><p>Perhaps because obsidian is too cheap, that Alliance Leader's ring space is limited, so he didn't bother to put it in.</p><p></p><p>Ye Xiao found a ten-thousand-year meteorite formation base from it, about the size of three cubic meters.</p><p></p><p>This thing is quite hard and can withstand a lot of spatial power infusion.</p><p></p><p>Ye Xiao used his divine craftsmanship to forge it into a rectangular base, with an initial land area of only five or six square meters and a thickness of about 20 centimeters.</p><p></p><p>As long as he adds the spatial power of obsidian to it, it will be able to produce the effect of spatial miniaturization.</p><p></p><p>Then, he can plant a huge amount of heavenly materials and earthly treasures inside.</p><p></p><p>But this process will have to wait until he has gathered enough obsidian.</p><p></p><p>Time flew by, and a night had passed in the blink of an eye.</p><p></p><p>Fortunately, Ye Xiao no longer needs to rest now.</p><p></p><p>His spiritual energy is now overflowing, constantly circulating within him, having long surpassed the physical constraints of ordinary humans.</p><p></p><p>In the morning, Xuanliuli used star beast materials to prepare a sumptuous breakfast for Ye Xiao, allowing him to replenish his blood and energy.</p><p></p><p>While eating breakfast, Ye Xiao dialed Wang Dalong's phone number.</p><p></p><p>"Hello! Brother Ye, do you have any more business for your little brother?"</p><p></p><p>"It's still about obsidian. This time I want a bit more, can you get me a few truckloads?"</p><p></p><p>"No problem, it's a small matter for your little brother."</p><p></p><p>Here is the full English translation of the Chinese excerpt:</p><p></p><p>"When do you need it? I'll send it over to you right away."</p><p></p><p>Ye Xiao was slightly taken aback.</p><p></p><p>"Has the delivery speed become this fast nowadays? Before, you still had to go through a period of collection."</p><p></p><p>"That was the past, it's different now. Our Jianghai City has been expanded, and we've also established a super-large martial arts resource transfer station. </p><p></p><p>All kinds of resources can be allocated at any time.</p><p></p><p>Only a few rare resources need to be procured from other places, but the speed is also very fast, much faster than before when we had to go through second- or third-tier cities. Now it's direct shipping, if you need it in the morning, it can be delivered by the afternoon.</p><p></p><p>I started a company with a few friends, so please feel free to patronize us in the future.</p><p></p><p>But don't buy anything recently, we just started and the inventory is still a bit tight. It should be much better after this month."</p><p></p><p>Ye Xiao then realized that with Jianghai City's continuous expansion and strengthening, this city was no longer the small town he used to live in. Instead, it had become a large city with a massive amount of martial arts resources, and was progressing towards becoming a super-large city! This was a good thing, as in the future, he wouldn't need to go to other cities to find things, he could just stay in Jianghai City and save a lot of trouble.</p><p></p><p>"Since that's the case, then please send it over when I get off work in the evening. You know the location."</p><p></p><p>"Don't worry, I'll make sure to get it done for you, President Ye."</p><p></p><p>After resolving this matter, Ye Xiao left home and went to work.</p><p></p><p>When he arrived at the library, it was just a little past 7 o'clock, with plenty of time before the official start of work.</p><p></p><p>Ye Xiao directly used the earth-traversing technique to go underground and collect today's offerings.</p><p></p><p>Seeing him arrive, all the star beasts enthusiastically rushed over to him.</p><p></p><p>"Master has come."</p><p></p><p>"Master, my cultivation level advanced by one layer yesterday, I've already promoted to the Xiantian Eighth Rank. Is the meat I offer even more tender now?"</p><p></p><p>"Master, have you had breakfast yet? How was the milk I squeezed yesterday? Was it fragrant? Sweet? If it's not sweet enough, I'll eat more sugarcane today."</p><p></p><p>Among all the star beasts, only Feng Long and Qing Niu did not come forward to fawn over him like the others.</p><p></p><p>Because they had just arrived the day before and were not yet accustomed to the life of being domesticated animals.</p><p></p><p>Ye Xiao waved his hand.</p><p></p><p>"Quiet down, all of you. I've already told you before that whoever can provide me with more blood qi, I will also give them more resources to help them further improve their strength.</p><p></p><p>Starting today, no, starting right now, this rule is in effect. </p><p></p><p>I will distribute appropriate materials based on your performance today."</p><p></p><p>Su Shan was the first to step forward, as she was the simplest of all the star beasts, only needing to brew honey, without having to sacrifice her own blood qi.</p><p></p><p>"I'm here, I'm here. I've already prepared, this is the honey I harvested last night, a total of twenty-eight barrels."</p><p></p><p>Ye Xiao nodded.</p><p></p><p>She had indeed done a very good job. Previously, she could only produce a few barrels of honey each night at most, but this time she had produced several times that amount.</p><p></p><p>With so much honey, Ye Xiao could use it to brew liquor with even more abundant spiritual energy, and with a little deer blood and deer antler, the blood qi enhancement should be able to reach several times the previous level.</p><p></p><p>"Here are ten white fragrant herbs, I don't need to explain their uses, do I? Is this enough to make up for the extra barrels of honey you produced?"</p><p></p><p>Su Shan's eyes lit up and she quickly nodded.</p><p></p><p>"Of course, of course."</p><p></p><p>The value of the white fragrant herbs was not something precious to Su Shan.</p><p></p><p>But the effort she had put in was just producing an extra twenty or so barrels of honey every night.</p><p></p><p>If calculated in terms of wages, this would be a huge earning, equivalent to a regular worker earning a thousand yuan per day.</p><p></p><p>More importantly, as a Shenzu-level star beast, she would not feel tired, and could even continuously brew honey, activate her cultivation technique, and even further improve her cultivation.</p><p></p><p>Calculating it this way, she could both improve her cultivation and earn a huge amount, why wouldn't she be eager to do it?</p><p></p><p>The other star beasts also had their eyes light up, and they couldn't help but get excited.</p><p></p><p>"Master, master, I also have good things. Look, I chopped off eight tentacles last night."</p><p></p><p>"Master, master, I chopped off two wings last night and stripped all the feathers off my body, they are the finest feathers."</p><p></p><p>"Master, look at how much milk I squeezed yesterday? I filled up several barrels, my udders are all swollen!"</p><p></p><p>The star beasts one by one offered their tributes.</p><p></p><p>Ye Xiao also distributed a large amount of resources to them accordingly.</p><p></p><p>This scene made the following Feng Long and Qing Niu swallow their saliva involuntarily.</p><p></p><p>"Hey, old mudfish, did you see that? He gave them so many things."</p><p></p><p>"Not just a lot, but many of them are top-tier treasures. Even we can use some of them to boost our cultivation."</p><p></p><p>"Do we still need to pretend to be aloof here?"</p><p></p><p>"I want to, but what he gave is really too much!"</p>

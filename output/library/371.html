        <h1>Chapter 371</h1>
        <div class="content">
            <p>Here is the full English translation of the Chinese excerpt:</p><p></p><p>He felt that this person in front of him was treating him like a fool, but he didn't dare to confirm it.</p><p></p><p>"Human, do you mean to say that you want this Sovereign to become your pet star?"</p><p></p><p>Ye Xiao shook his head.</p><p></p><p>"It's not a pet star, but if you insist on a title, you can consider yourself as a domestic animal or livestock.</p><p></p><p>Of course, if you want a more elegant term, then it's that I want you to assist me in my cultivation."</p><p></p><p>The big fish immediately flared up in anger.</p><p></p><p>What kind of joke is this? Is this person in front of him out of his mind? Who is he? He is the mighty Beast Sovereign!</p><p></p><p>A Beast Sovereign who has surpassed the super divine beast realm and is comparable to a divine-level expert!</p><p></p><p>He is a supreme powerhouse capable of dominating an entire star domain.</p><p></p><p>This human actually wants to make him a livestock.</p><p></p><p>Should he be called naive, or cute? Or perhaps, idiotic?</p><p></p><p>"Human, I feel the need to make one thing clear to you. I am the Beast Sovereign! Although I don't know what method you used to heal my injuries, I am still the Beast Sovereign! This is something that no one can change.</p><p></p><p>And another thing, you just took advantage of my weakened state to attack me.</p><p></p><p>If I'm not mistaken, your cultivation should only be at the third level of the Divine Realm, right?"</p><p></p><p>As soon as he finished speaking, Ye Xiao unleashed the Annihilation Treasure Art.</p><p></p><p>Puchi! The big fish's body was split in half.</p><p></p><p>The excruciating pain and the spilling of his innards once again plunged the big fish into confusion.</p><p></p><p>What is going on? The other party's strength is only at the third level of the Divine Realm, while I'm at the fifth level! </p><p></p><p>He didn't make a mistake!</p><p></p><p>He could clearly feel that his aura was stronger than the other party's.</p><p></p><p>He was indeed at the fifth level of the Divine Realm, and Ye Xiao was indeed at the third level.</p><p></p><p>But he didn't even see the other party attack, and Ye Xiao had already annihilated him.</p><p></p><p>What is going on? Wait a minute! Something seems off.</p><p></p><p>He suddenly broke out in a cold sweat!</p><p></p><p>This is too abnormal.</p><p></p><p>Thinking carefully, the other party's strength is actually lower than his, but he dared to attack him, which is already a very unreasonable thing.</p><p></p><p>And now, the other party has the power to instantly injure him, which is enough to prove that the other party had intentions towards him from the very beginning.</p><p></p><p>Moreover, the other party has been able to control him from the beginning.</p><p></p><p>Even more terrifying is that the other party also possesses the healing art.</p><p></p><p>While devouring his flesh and blood, he can also use the spiritual energy of heaven and earth to repair his own body.</p><p></p><p>He is actually using him as an infinite source of blood energy to enhance his own strength? This bastard!</p><p></p><p>"You insignificant human, what do you think the Beast Sovereign is? Do you think I'm one of your trash subordinates?</p><p></p><p>The Beast Sovereign has his own dignity! You want to use me to assist your cultivation. Dream on!"</p><p></p><p>The next moment, he directly detonated his own body.</p><p></p><p>As the mighty Beast Sovereign, even if he had to self-destruct and take the other party down with him, he would never become the other party's tool.</p><p></p><p>I'll blow you up along with myself, let's see what you can do then? This is the price you pay for daring to offend the Beast Sovereign!</p><p></p><p>Next time, clear your mind a bit.</p><p></p><p>It's unknown how much time had passed, maybe just a moment, or perhaps a long time.</p><p></p><p>The big fish looked at the intact Ye Xiao in front of him, sinking into deep confusion.</p><p></p><p>"Is this an illusion?"</p><p></p><p>As soon as he spoke, his body was in pain again, damn it, Ye Xiao had cut off half of his body again.</p><p></p><p>"What a waste to play such dangerous games. Such good fish meat, it would be a shame to waste it."</p><p></p><p>After a pause, he spoke again:</p><p></p><p>"Self-detonation is useless. Your self-detonation can at most just slightly injure my body, far from being able to make me disintegrate and disperse my soul. This level, I can just heal it with my healing art, and then heal you as well.</p><p></p><p>So just save your energy!"</p><p></p><p>The next moment, Ye Xiao left the underground cellar.</p><p></p><p>He hadn't eaten enough just now, he still wanted to continue enjoying his delicious meal.</p><p></p><p>As for the big fish, he was plunged into deep, seething anger.</p><p></p><p>"Damn bastard, what's so great about you? You're just an ordinary human after all. It's just that your cultivation method may be a bit stronger, so you can fight beyond your level. Do you think I, the Beast Sovereign, will be afraid of you?</p><p></p><p>What storms and winds have I not seen before?</p><p></p><p>Give me thirty years! In thirty years, I will break through again, reaching a realm comparable to the sixth level of the Divine Realm.</p><p></p><p>And you? Can you break through to the fourth level of the Divine Realm by then?</p><p></p><p>Trash!</p><p></p><p>That will be the end of you."</p><p></p><p>The following days returned to the usual routine, with Ye Xiao reading books in the library during the day and eating meat at home at night.</p><p></p><p>However, even the most delicious food will become tiring after eating it for a few days, and this is a very torturous thing for a glutton like him, but he has no other choice.</p><p></p><p>The big fish is comparable to the fifth level of the Divine Realm, his blood energy is too rich, if he could eat his meat every day, he might be able to break through a realm in just a month.</p><p></p><p>Here is the full English translation of the Chinese excerpt:</p><p></p><p>Not eating his flesh, it would take about two months to break through to a new realm.</p><p></p><p>Ye Xiao now needs to greatly improve his cultivation in order to ensure that he can protect himself from more powerful beings.</p><p></p><p>Unfortunately, Sovereign Beast-level star beasts are really too hard to find.</p><p></p><p>Otherwise, he would have already gone out and caught a few back.</p><p></p><p>No choice, he'll just have to make do for now.</p><p></p><p>That day, as soon as Ye Xiao arrived at the library for work, he heard a thunderous dragon roar.</p><p></p><p>That was the ancient dragon's legacy, protecting the Nine Provinces' Great Wall Formation.</p><p></p><p>The control of this formation was previously in his hands.</p><p></p><p>But later, because the Xuanyuan Clan came, he was not convenient to show himself, so he transferred the control to the Jing Emperor.</p><p></p><p>Today, the Great Wall Formation suddenly opened, could it be because the Three Clans' people have already started to clash with the Xuanyuan Clan?</p><p></p><p>As expected, in the morning when the leader held a meeting, Yao Meiqin directly announced this matter.</p><p></p><p>"Everyone, starting from today, the entire Nine Provinces will enter a state of first-level combat readiness.</p><p></p><p>Everyone knows that our Xuanyuan Clan has recently discovered many divine tombs in the starry sky, and because of this, we have suffered the jealousy and resentment of the Three Clans, so they launched an attack on us.</p><p></p><p>But don't worry, our Xuanyuan Clan will definitely annihilate all enemies and resolutely uphold the dignity of our Xuanyuan Clan."</p><p></p><p>The emotions of the colleagues were all stirred up.</p><p></p><p>"Down with the Three Clans!"</p><p>"Long live the Xuanyuan Clan!"</p><p>"We will definitely be the ultimate victors."</p><p></p><p>Ye Xiao's mind was relatively calm. He knew that Yao Meiqin's words had a certain degree of artistic processing.</p><p></p><p>But this is also very normal, after all, it is necessary to consolidate the self-confidence of one's own clan.</p><p></p><p>And from the beginning, it was indeed the Three Clans who committed the offense first.</p><p></p><p>If they had not sent spies over, he would not have taken action either. Their spies did not kill the people of the Xuanyuan Clan, nor did they steal the Gui Huo Spirit Eyes from the North Hall Strategy, so all the subsequent events would not have happened.</p><p></p><p>And Ye Xiao believes that the Xuanyuan Clan can withstand this matter.</p><p></p><p>When the possibility of the existence of a Divine King's Tomb was discovered earlier, Ning Zhiyuan had already decided to increase the number of experts coming over.</p><p></p><p>Now that so much time has passed, those reinforcements must have already arrived here.</p><p></p><p>Ye Xiao doesn't know the strength of the Ning Family, but he knows that with their strength, dealing with the Three Clans is absolutely no problem.</p><p></p><p>The Xuanyuan Clan is the orthodox clan of the Xuanyuan Family, and under the Xuanyuan Family, there are ten direct lineage clans! The Ning Family is one of the ten direct lineage clans.</p><p></p><p>The strongest experts of the Ning Family are said to even have Divine King Realm cultivators! The strength of the Ning Family can be said to be unfathomable.</p><p></p><p>The facts turned out exactly as Ye Xiao had imagined.</p><p></p><p>The Great Wall Formation only maintained for half an hour before automatically deactivating.</p><p></p><p>This means that the battle in the starry sky has already ended.</p><p></p><p>The people the Three Clans sent this time should be quite a few, and there should even be some Divine Realm experts among them! Even so, they could not resist the attack of one of the Xuanyuan Clan's direct lineage families, which shows how powerful the Ning Family is.</p><p></p><p>It also shows how powerful the Xuanyuan Clan is.</p><p></p><p>Even more terrifying is that the Xuanyuan Clan is only ranked 19th among all the existences in the entire universe.</p><p></p><p>One wonders how strong the first and second ranked existences would be?</p><p></p><p>Could it be that a single strike from them would be at the Divine Emperor Realm?</p><p></p><p>Ye Xiao just thinking about it makes his scalp tingle with a sense of unease.</p><p></p><p>Moreover, as the top-tier race in the starry sky, their Divine Emperor experts must possess attack methods at the Ancient Treasure Art level.</p><p></p><p>He really doesn't know how powerful he would need to become to be on par with them. This further strengthens Ye Xiao's determination to steadily advance in the library.</p><p></p><p>In the starry sky, the disciples of the Xuanyuan Clan were quickly cleaning up the battlefield.</p><p></p><p>Everywhere were the corpses of the Three Clans' members, with a few Xuanyuan Clan members mixed in as well.</p><p></p><p>But the majority were the corpses of the Three Clans.</p><p></p><p>Ning Zhiyuan looked at the defeated Three Clans' corpses in front of him, and his heart finally let out a sigh of relief.</p><p></p><p>Fortunately, Ning Family's reinforcements arrived in time.</p><p></p><p>Otherwise, the corpses lying on the ground at this moment would not have been from other clans, but from his own Ning Family.</p><p></p><p>He cupped his hands towards a figure beside him and thanked him:</p><p></p><p>"Second Uncle, I owe this to you. If you hadn't come so quickly, I really wouldn't know what to do."</p><p></p><p>Ning Second Uncle patted Ning Zhiyuan's shoulder and comforted him with a smile, saying, "You are the young master of our Ning Family. As your uncle, I could not bear to see you suffer, right? And the fact that you were able to discover the information about the Divine King's Tomb is also a great merit for our Ning Family."</p><p></p><p>Ning Zhiyuan smiled sheepishly.</p><p></p><p>"Speaking of which, I still haven't found that Divine King's Tomb yet."</p><p></p><p>"You silly boy, if the Divine King's Tomb was so easy to find, the Divine King experts would not be so valuable!"</p>

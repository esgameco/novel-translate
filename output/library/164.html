        <h1>Chapter 164</h1>
        <div class="content">
            <p>Here is the full English translation of the Chinese excerpt:</p><p></p><p>At the same time, he was also supporting this mountain body, because the mountain body had been eroded by the resentful spirit qi, and without his support, it would collapse at any moment!</p><p></p><p>He was also a respectable senior.</p><p></p><p>It's just that I don't know why he had the Tathagata Divine Palm that had been lost from Shaolin for many years.</p><p></p><p>Afterwards, Ye Xiao picked up the storage ring on the ground, swept the Taixuan Tiangong, and broke the formation on the ring, and then saw what was inside the ring.</p><p></p><p>There were some medicinal pills, a few rare heavenly materials and earthly treasures, and some star beast cores and cultivation techniques.</p><p></p><p>There was also a map and two letters.</p><p></p><p>One was addressed to "My beloved Lin Wan", and the other was addressed to "The one who obtains this ring".</p><p></p><p>Ye Xiao opened the latter and learned the whole story.</p><p></p><p>This monk named Fa Xin was ordered by the abbot of Shaolin to come to the Lin City Martial Arts Academy and establish a Shaolin branch there more than 40 years ago.</p><p></p><p>But on the way, he accidentally passed through a cave and learned the Tathagata Divine Palm.</p><p></p><p>After arriving in Lin City, he secretly learned the Tathagata Divine Palm while teaching, and fell in love with Lin Wan, the commander of the Lin City defense team.</p><p></p><p>Ye Xiao thought of the middle-aged woman he had met in the mountains earlier. It turned out to be quite a coincidence.</p><p></p><p>As for Fa Xin's love affair, Ye Xiao was not curious, as nowadays monks are allowed to get married and have relationships.</p><p></p><p>In addition, he was a little curious, as Fa Xin and Fa Zheng were about the same age, could it be that they were sworn brothers?</p><p></p><p>He continued reading.</p><p></p><p>In order to marry Lin Wan, Fa Xin planned to collect materials and refine a medicinal pill to help his beloved cultivate stronger and be with him for a long time.</p><p></p><p>Because his own cultivation of the Tathagata Divine Palm had already broken through the peak of the great sect, while Lin Wan had just entered the Xiantian First Rank Patriarch realm.</p><p></p><p>The gap between them was too large, and their lifespans would inevitably be unequal.</p><p></p><p>But he didn't expect that on this mountain, he would encounter dozens of half-beasts, harming the people of Lin City, using the fresh blood and resentment of the people of Lin City to cultivate evil techniques.</p><p></p><p>After fighting them, he was unable to slay them and was seriously injured. In order to prevent their evil techniques from being perfected and harming Lin City, and also worried that Lin Wan would be harmed, he could only use all his strength to activate the Tathagata Divine Palm and form a seal to imprison the resentful spirits here.</p><p></p><p>This letter described the method of dealing with the resentful spirits, which required cultivating a supremely yang and unyielding martial art, combined with a spiritual cultivation technique.</p><p></p><p>The other letter and the materials and medicinal pills in the ring were left for Lin Wan.</p><p></p><p>As for the map, it was a map to that cave.</p><p></p><p>Furthermore, in that cave, there were other Buddhist martial arts, but due to his insufficient aptitude, he could only learn half of the Tathagata Divine Palm, and the other techniques, he could only remember in his heart but could not learn.</p><p></p><p>Ye Xiao's eyes flickered.</p><p></p><p>Unexpectedly, there was such a story.</p><p></p><p>Given Fa Xin's aptitude, since he could learn half of the Tathagata Divine Palm, but could not comprehend the remaining techniques, it shows that the other techniques were definitely not ordinary.</p><p></p><p>Could they be imperial arts?</p><p></p><p>If that's the case, it would be good news for Ye Xiao.</p><p></p><p>However, the map was drawn a bit obscurely, probably hastily drawn by Fa Xin from memory before his death.</p><p></p><p>After returning, he would check the classics and maps to determine the location and definitely go take a look.</p><p></p><p>Ye Xiao took out the other cultivation techniques from Fa Xin's storage ring and took a look. They were all Shaolin Sect-level techniques, including two sword techniques, one fist technique, and one leg technique.</p><p></p><p>Ye Xiao immediately scanned them.</p><p></p><p>The two sword techniques were useless, as Ye Xiao had already collected all the basic sword techniques. Unless they were imperial-level sword techniques, his divine soul would not record them.</p><p></p><p>But fortunately, the fist technique and leg technique were actually basic techniques that Ye Xiao's Golden Book divine soul had not recorded yet.</p><p></p><p>Jackpot.</p><p></p><p>Ye Xiao completely absorbed this fist technique and leg technique into his divine soul, and the Golden Book divine soul immediately began to cultivate them.</p><p></p><p>Within an hour, both techniques had reached the Great Perfection realm.</p><p></p><p>Immediately, all the basic fist techniques in Ye Xiao's divine soul were lit up.</p><p></p><p>This meant that the fist techniques could be fused.</p><p></p><p>Ye Xiao's mouth curved upwards slightly, and he directly activated the Golden Book divine soul to begin fusing the techniques.</p><p></p><p>The Golden Book flashed with golden light, and each page recording the fist techniques gradually formed a large character.</p><p></p><p>Wonderful! Exquisite! Magnificent! Extraordinary! Damn it, as a high school graduate, he couldn't understand a single one! Too much bullying.</p><p></p><p>Alas, the Golden Book was a divine soul, not an illusion jade, otherwise he would definitely drag it out and beat it up.</p><p></p><p>Soon, all the pages were completely fused together, quickly forming a brand new imperial art - the Great Nirvana Fist! The Great Nirvana Fist, one punch to destroy everything, undefeatable!</p><p></p><p>"So powerful!"</p><p></p><p>Indeed, it was worthy of being an imperial art, each one so strong that it made one's heart tremble.</p><p></p><p>Fortunately, this fist technique was his own, so there was no problem. If it belonged to someone else, especially an enemy, he might end up crying one day.</p><p></p><p>Afterwards, Ye Xiao immediately activated the Golden Book divine soul and began to cultivate the Great Nirvana Fist.</p><p></p><p>Outside the mountain, the Lin City defense team, after a two-day and one-night battle, had reached the final stage of slaughtering the star beasts.</p><p></p><p>Commander Lin Wan had already arranged for the team members to withdraw from the mountain and deploy at the foot of the mountain.</p><p></p><p>Every night during these two days, Lin Wan would...</p><p></p><p>Here is the full English translation of the Chinese excerpt:</p><p></p><p>"Let the team members withdraw, the lighting in the mountain forest is not good at night, and the team members are very likely to be attacked by the star beasts.</p><p></p><p>"Today's mission ends here, we'll continue tomorrow during the day. <div class="contentadv"><script>loadAdv(7,3);</script></div>In addition, all team members, don't be slack, these star beasts have been attacked by us, and they may retaliate at night, so everyone still needs to be vigilant, in case the star beasts come down the mountain and enter the Forest City, attacking the citizens."</p><p></p><p>"Yes!"</p><p></p><p>"Okay, dismissed."</p><p></p><p>Lin Wan announced the dismissal, letting everyone get on the car and return to the city, while she walked alone towards the Forest City.</p><p></p><p>All these years, she has been striving to improve herself, even though she was already tired from a day's work, she still had to run back, instead of taking the car.</p><p></p><p>This way, her body would not age, and she would remain youthful.</p><p></p><p>She wanted to live on, waiting for that heartless person, to ask him why he never came back. The defense team members sat in the car and left, looking at Lin Wan walking alone from the car window, couldn't help but feel sorry for her: "Commander Lin is really pitiful, she's tired from a day's work, and still has to walk by herself?"</p><p></p><p>"You don't know, this is Commander Lin's habit, she is always striving to cultivate herself."</p><p></p><p>"Why is Commander Lin so ambitious? After all, she's a woman, doesn't her husband care that she's working so hard?"</p><p></p><p>"I heard that Commander Lin was dumped by a heartless person years ago, and she's still single, where would she have a husband who cares for her?"</p><p></p><p>"Forget it, keep your voice down, Commander Lin is a master of the innate second rank, her senses are more acute than ours, if she hears this, it won't be good."</p><p></p><p>The car gradually drove farther and farther away on the mountain road, leaving only Lin Wan walking alone on the road, feeling lonely under the starlight.</p><p></p><p>However, she soon stopped in her tracks, because she found a figure standing on the road ahead, hands in his pockets, waiting for her.</p><p></p><p>"You are... the young man from the mountain the other day?"</p><p></p><p>Lin Wan was a little surprised, as if she didn't expect Ye Xiao to suddenly appear here.</p><p></p><p>Ye Xiao nodded.</p><p></p><p>"What are you doing here?"</p><p></p><p>Lin Wan's gaze had a hint of vigilance.</p><p></p><p>Ye Xiao gave her a mysterious feeling, a sense of the unknown.</p><p></p><p>And he was out here alone at night, if it was just a coincidence, it would be a bit too much.</p><p></p><p>Ye Xiao spoke calmly:</p><p></p><p>"I was entrusted by a friend to come and give Commander Lin a letter."</p><p></p><p>"A letter, what letter? Who asked you to send it?"</p><p></p><p>"You'll understand after you read the letter."</p><p></p><p>Ye Xiao threw out the storage ring, the map and the first letter inside had already been taken by him, the other things were what the Dharma Seal had left for Lin Wan, and he had not coveted them.</p><p></p><p>The moment Lin Wan took the storage ring, her pupils immediately shrank, obviously she had recognized the identity of this ring.</p><p></p><p>And the next second, she immersed herself in the ring, took out the letter inside, and eagerly tore open the envelope to read the contents.</p><p></p><p>"Wan, I'm sorry, by the time you see this letter, I will no longer be here. I'm sorry to say goodbye to you in this way. I don't know if you've already married and forgotten me when you see this letter.</p><p></p><p>In my life, I believed in Buddhism in the first half, and believed in you in the second half.</p><p></p><p>It's just a pity that I couldn't accompany you to the end..."</p><p></p><p>After reading the letter, Lin Wan was already crying uncontrollably, decades of waiting, but in the end, this was the result.</p><p></p><p>If time could be turned back, she would never have let the Dharma Seal refine the elixir for her.</p><p></p><p>"Where is he? Where is he?"</p><p></p><p>Lin Wan shouted anxiously at Ye Xiao.</p><p></p><p>Ye Xiao replied calmly, "He's in this mountain. The mountain body has been hollowed out, and he's relying on his own cultivation to support it. When his last bit of cultivation is exhausted, this mountain will collapse."</p><p></p><p>Lin Wan looked back at the pitch-black mountain, which in the darkness looked like a huge monster devouring people.</p><p></p><p>She plopped down on the ground and started wailing.</p><p></p><p>"Why didn't you come back? How could you leave me alone like this?"</p><p></p><p>Ye Xiao spoke again:</p><p></p><p>"He did it for the people of Forest City, and for you.</p><p></p><p>Inside this mountain, there are half-beasts cultivating evil methods. If they are released, the entire Forest City will be in ruins, and you would not escape it either.</p><p></p><p>You should live on bravely, because he has left all his love for you."</p><p></p><p>Lin Wan was grief-stricken, tightly clutching the Dharma Seal's ring.</p><p></p><p>Although Ye Xiao couldn't empathize, he also felt a sense of awe.</p><p></p><p>Sometimes, the power of love, kinship, and friendship is truly beyond the imagination of ordinary people.</p><p></p><p>Unfortunately, the Dharma Seal's soul has been exhausted, and he cannot use the healing art, otherwise he wouldn't mind saving him once.</p><p></p><p>However, it seems that heaven is not prepared to give Lin Wan time to grieve, nor is it prepared to give Ye Xiao time to ponder.</p><p></p><p>At this moment, the ground suddenly began to tremble.</p>

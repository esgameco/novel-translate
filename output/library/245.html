        <h1>Chapter 245</h1>
        <div class="content">
            <p>Here is the full English translation of the Chinese excerpt:</p><p></p><p>Ye Xiao nodded.</p><p></p><p>The various beast stars immediately felt a great sense of relief and turned to flee.</p><p></p><p>However, as soon as they turned around, a few sword beams swept in, directly piercing through their hearts.</p><p></p><p>Thud, thud. The powerful beast stars fell one by one, their eyes filled with disbelief.</p><p></p><p>It seemed they couldn't understand why, after doing as Ye Xiao had said, he still killed them all.</p><p></p><p>"The human race is shameless."</p><p></p><p>In fact, Ye Xiao never intended to let them go in the first place. </p><p></p><p>Each of these beast stars had blood of the human race on their hands, having devoured countless humans. Even if he let them go, they would continue to kill and eat people.</p><p></p><p>This was a conflict between two opposing races, there was no need to talk about benevolence and righteousness.</p><p></p><p>Furthermore, Ye Xiao was now a powerful expert. The strong do as they please.</p><p></p><p>He killed if he wanted to, and spared if he didn't want to. </p><p></p><p>It was all up to his own will.</p><p></p><p>Although they had brought him the materials he wanted, they had also gained an extra hour of life. Otherwise, they would have died long ago.</p><p></p><p>But as the weaker party, they could only curse the shamelessness of the human race.</p><p></p><p>The weak have no right to even cry.</p><p></p><p>After slaying these beast stars, Ye Xiao activated the Plucking Star Hand, categorizing all the beast stars.</p><p></p><p>Powerful experts like the Thunder Qing Ox and Eight-Legged Steed could be directly refined into a medicinal pill.</p><p></p><p>As for the others, like those at the Innate Seventh Grade cultivation, they needed to be appropriately combined with some Innate Sixth Grade beast star grandmasters.</p><p></p><p>This was to ensure the twenty-one medicinal pills would not have too large a gap between them.</p><p></p><p>Next was the allocation of materials.</p><p></p><p>Among the materials brought by the beast star grandmasters, there were some ginseng and blood spirit mushrooms over a thousand years old, and even some extremely rare materials thousands of years old.</p><p></p><p>These were the pinnacles among the pinnacles. They might not be as numerous as the myriad flowers and leaves.</p><p></p><p>But the total spiritual energy contained in all of them far exceeded that of the myriad flowers and leaves.</p><p></p><p>After categorizing and arranging all the materials, Ye Xiao immediately began to cultivate the Myriad Elements Return to One Pill Refining Art.</p><p></p><p>This was the first time he was simultaneously refining so many medicinal pills, but with Ye Xiao's current spiritual energy, it was not a difficult task.</p><p></p><p>If it were other pill refiners, even the strongest in the Nine Provinces or even the entire world, they would not have Ye Xiao's advantage.</p><p></p><p>The reason was simple - his spiritual energy cultivation had reached the peak of the Nine Provinces.</p><p></p><p>Other pill refiners could at most reach the grandmaster level, which was already quite impressive.</p><p></p><p>The gap between them was simply too large.</p><p></p><p>As the Myriad Elements Return to One was cultivated, twenty-one beams of light connected to the twenty-one piles of materials Ye Xiao had already organized.</p><p></p><p>Subsequently, the twenty-one piles of materials began to undergo purification, removing all impurities and extracting the essence to be used in refining the medicinal pills.</p><p></p><p>This process took a little while, as it was a total of twenty-one medicinal pills, not just a single one.</p><p></p><p>As time passed, the twenty-one piles of materials began to change - all the beast star flesh gradually withered and turned to ash. </p><p></p><p>Then, from within them, drop by drop, golden liquid began to condense. </p><p></p><p>This was the essence contained within them. Once all their essence had been absorbed, in the blink of an eye, one golden medicinal pill after another began to form.</p><p></p><p>The twenty-one medicinal pills, like twenty-one miniature suns, emitted a golden glow that illuminated half of the Devil Demon Cliff.</p><p></p><p>These medicinal pills contained extremely powerful and terrifying spiritual energy. Consuming just one could instantly boost one's cultivation.</p><p></p><p>And now there were twenty-one of them! Rumble...</p><p></p><p>Above, several bolts of lightning fell from the sky.</p><p></p><p>Soon, dark clouds rapidly gathered, and in just tens of seconds, a massive thundercloud had formed in the sky.</p><p></p><p>Crack! Lightning like a sharp dagger burst forth from the clouds, piercing through the Devil Demon Cliff to the bottom.</p><p></p><p>Some beast stars that had not yet fled could no longer hold on. </p><p></p><p>Now even nature was striking with lightning, who could withstand it? No beast star dared to stay, all fleeing in desperation.</p><p></p><p>Crack, crack, rumble. The lightning from the twenty-one medicinal pills kept gathering, and in the blink of an eye, there were over sixty to seventy bolts falling every second.</p><p></p><p>On average, each medicinal pill had two to three lightning bolts.</p><p></p><p>If there was only one medicinal pill, the lightning might have taken a while to fully form and solidify the pill.</p><p></p><p>But this time, Ye Xiao was refining a total of twenty-one Emperor Pills at once, which was almost a challenge to the power of the laws of the heavens.</p><p></p><p>This is why the lightning was falling in such great numbers.</p><p></p><p>The lightning struck the bottom of the Devil Demon Cliff, continuously tempering the twenty-one medicinal pills.</p><p></p><p>Here is my translation of the Chinese excerpt:</p><p></p><p>One ray, two rays, three rays, ten rays, a hundred rays.</p><p></p><p>The lightning and thunder grew more and more intense, and the alchemical pills finally took shape, ultimately forming twenty-one gleaming golden imperial pills.</p><p></p><p>All the heavenly materials and earthly treasures, as well as the blood, flesh, and souls of the star beasts, were perfectly fused into the star cores at the center of these pills.</p><p></p><p>Radiating brilliant light, illuminating the entire Heavenly Demon Cliff. Each pill was imprinted with the power of lightning.</p><p></p><p>The lightning in the sky above had begun to gradually dissipate, swirling with electric light and thunder, as if waiting for something.</p><p></p><p>They could no longer continue to attack the pills, because all of the pills had already been formed.</p><p></p><p>The power of the rules was no longer suitable to deal with them.</p><p></p><p>But they seemed to vaguely guess what Ye Xiao was trying to do, so they did not leave.</p><p></p><p>Instead, they were waiting for Ye Xiao.</p><p></p><p>Hum~.</p><p></p><p>All the pills began to tremble.</p><p></p><p>Their power had reached its peak, forming a self-awareness, and they wanted to escape.</p><p></p><p>Unfortunately, under Ye Xiao's control, none of them could flee.</p><p></p><p>They could only keep emitting trembling cries in the air.</p><p></p><p>It couldn't be helped, when they were still divine lord-level star beasts before, they had never been able to escape Ye Xiao, and now it was even more impossible.</p><p></p><p>Ye Xiao glanced up at the lightning in the sky, which was waiting for him.</p><p></p><p>Finally, he began to act.</p><p></p><p>Facing this lightning, he had nothing to fear. If he wanted to become a king, and couldn't even pass this tiny test, how could he ever become a king?</p><p></p><p>Ye Xiao waved his hand, and one of the pills was swallowed by him.</p><p></p><p>Boom! The imperial pill entered his body, letting out a mournful cry, then directly exploding, erupting in his viscera and rushing towards all his meridians.</p><p></p><p>All of Ye Xiao's cultivation techniques were activated at this moment.</p><p></p><p>One energy vortex after another formed, spinning crazily within Ye Xiao's body.</p><p></p><p>This time, even the Grand Heavenly Formation and the Immortal Indestructible were activated.</p><p></p><p>Because the souls of the star beasts had also been refined together in these pills.</p><p></p><p>Their soul power and spiritual power were also extremely powerful.</p><p></p><p>After enduring the first pill, Ye Xiao immediately swallowed the second, this time two pills at once.</p><p></p><p>The third time, he swallowed four pills.</p><p></p><p>The fourth time, he swallowed six pills.</p><p></p><p>The fifth time, he swallowed eight pills! All twenty-one pills were completely devoured by him, and the massive energy erupted within his body, directly shattering his flesh and meridians into a bloody mess.</p><p></p><p>But Ye Xiao was not afraid at all, and even used his own power to form a closed environment around his body to prevent this energy from escaping.</p><p></p><p>At the same time, he also used the Dawn Star Technique, the Extreme Healing Art, and the Supplementary Heaven Technique, three healing-type cultivation methods, to rapidly repair his body.</p><p></p><p>In this cyclical process, the spiritual energy constantly washed over him, and soon the fresh blood oozing from Ye Xiao began to turn a faint golden color.</p><p></p><p>This was the sign of him becoming a King Realm cultivator.</p><p></p><p>Crack! The lightning in the sky above could no longer hold back! Transforming into countless long dragons, they frantically plummeted down.</p><p></p><p>Thunderous and mighty.</p><p></p><p>All the lightning fell upon Ye Xiao's body.</p><p></p><p>Ye Xiao not only did not dodge, but instead allowed this lightning to strike him, helping him temper his physique and completely purge the last of the impurities within him.</p><p></p><p>The lightning grew more and more intense, completely disregarding whether Ye Xiao could maintain it or not.</p><p></p><p>In the end, due to the sheer amount and power of the lightning, there was no longer any gap between it and the ground, and all that could be seen was a pillar of light falling from the clouds above to the Heavenly Demon Cliff below!</p><p></p><p>Any living being that approached this light pillar would instantly turn to ash.</p><p></p><p>Even a Divine Lord could not withstand it for more than two seconds.</p><p></p><p>Time passed, second by second.</p><p></p><p>Suddenly!</p><p></p><p>After one hundred and eight seconds, a golden light abruptly shot up from the Heavenly Demon Cliff, letting out a dragon's roar that dominated the heavens, piercing into the clouds.</p><p></p><p>Boom! A violent explosion echoed through the sky, and all the thunderclouds instantly dissipated.</p><p></p><p>In the sky, a figure stood proudly, eyes closed, arms spread wide, feeling the immense power within him at this moment.</p><p></p><p>The surrounding clouds, at this moment, seemed afraid to defy him, lowering their altitude, not daring to float at the same level as him.</p><p></p><p>Not only the clouds, but even the wind that came to his side seemed to stop flowing, becoming silent and daring not to act recklessly in front of him.</p><p></p><p>It was as if the powers of nature were subconsciously sensing the terrifying might within him.</p><p></p><p>"So this is the power of the King Realm?" Ye Xiao murmured, the corners of his mouth slightly upturned, his expression utterly content.</p><p></p><p>Satisfying!</p><p></p><p>Unparalleled satisfaction!</p>

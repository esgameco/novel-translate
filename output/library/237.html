        <h1>Chapter 237</h1>
        <div class="content">
            <p>Here is the full English translation of the Chinese excerpt:</p><p></p><p>Because the last time he refined a super-potent elixir, it had triggered a heavenly tribulation, so this time Ye Xiao came to the outskirts of Zhongzhou City to find an open space to refine the elixir.</p><p></p><p>The great dragon he had summoned was guarding by his side.</p><p></p><p>Setting up the formation array was quite troublesome, but the great dragon had the ability to fight independently, so with him guarding, there was no problem.</p><p></p><p>After entrusting the great dragon with security, Ye Xiao directly took out the star core of the shadow bat, the flesh and blood of the shadow bat, as well as three corpses of the sword dragon Azathoth, and several corpses of the poison dragon scorpion lord.</p><p></p><p>Ye Xiao either wouldn't refine an elixir at all, or if he did, he had to refine it to the utmost perfection, so as not to waste his own energy and time.</p><p></p><p>As the "Myriad Elements Converge" technique started to operate, Ye Xiao quickly removed all the impurities from the star beast meat and extracted the essence, then infused it into the star core.</p><p></p><p>The star core initially resisted a bit after receiving the energy feedback, because it still retained the consciousness of the shadow bat.</p><p></p><p>In addition to that, Ye Xiao also completely merged the shattered soul of the shadow bat that he had previously destroyed, into the star core, to enhance his own soul power.</p><p></p><p>Although his soul power was already very strong, that didn't mean it had reached its peak. In the future, when he broke through to the Emperor Realm, he would need even more soul power. If he didn't prepare for it in advance, what would he do? Soul power couldn't be directly absorbed, it had to be refined into an elixir first, in order to safely absorb it without the other party's stray thoughts merging into his own soul and skewing his personality.</p><p></p><p>Heaven forbid if a second personality emerged with an extremely low probability, turning him into a case of dissociative identity disorder - that would be an even bigger trouble.</p><p></p><p>In short, safety must be the top priority, especially for things that are consumed.</p><p></p><p>Rumble... Soon, a large patch of dark clouds began to gather in the sky above, and the sound of thunder followed immediately.</p><p></p><p>The city that had just regained its tranquility was once again oppressed in an instant.</p><p></p><p>Everyone looking at the thunderclouds in the sky couldn't help but have a puzzled expression.</p><p></p><p>Only Beitang Ce stared outside, his spirit fire pupils flickering, filled with shock.</p><p></p><p>"That aura, it seems to be Mr. Ye. What is he up to again?"</p><p></p><p>Soon, his phone rang - it was a call from Shi Guanghao. Regarding this, Beitang Ce simply made an excuse to brush it off.</p><p></p><p>After all, it was Ye Xiao doing something, so he didn't want to ask too much. As long as he could provide some cover, he would go along with it.</p><p></p><p>On Ye Xiao's side, he was continuously refining the essence of the star beasts and the star core, and soon he refined a pure golden elixir.</p><p></p><p>In the sky, the lightning bolts fell furiously, like raging dragons, covering the entire area.</p><p></p><p>All the lightning bolts gathered on the elixir, both tempering it and refining it.</p><p></p><p>If the elixir could withstand it, it would become an Emperor Elixir. If the elixir couldn't withstand it, it would turn to ashes, and Ye Xiao would gain nothing.</p><p></p><p>At this time, Ye Xiao's elixir refinement technique shifted from tempering the elixir to assisting its formation.</p><p></p><p>The "Myriad Elements Converge" technique continuously infused spiritual energy power into the elixir, giving it even greater resistance.</p><p></p><p>Boom, boom, boom...</p><p></p><p>The intensity of the lightning strikes in the sky gradually increased.</p><p></p><p>But this elixir refinement was not as strong as the previous one that produced the Myriad Colored Leaves.</p><p></p><p>Even with the body of a semi-divine star beast, one must know that the eight-colored Myriad Colored Leaves was only one step away from breaking through to the nine-colored, already considered an exceptional material among heaven and earth treasures.</p><p></p><p>The heavenly and earthly spiritual energy it contained was so powerful.</p><p></p><p>Finally, after dozens of seconds of bombardment, the elixir was completely formed. At this point, all the thunderbolts retreated, although reluctantly, and could only hover under the clouds, unable to continue falling to the ground.</p><p></p><p>They could no longer harm the elixir, and even if they continued to strike, it would be futile.</p><p></p><p>They could only look at the elixir, now covered in lightning patterns, which had become a true Emperor Elixir, with resentment.</p><p></p><p>And at the same time, the elixir had also developed a trace of sentience. Seizing the moment of just having been successfully refined, it instantly transformed into a golden light and tried to flee.</p><p></p><p>Ye Xiao was not flustered, he casually reached out with his Pluck Star Hand technique, instantly capturing it.</p><p></p><p>The elixir, caught by the power of Ye Xiao's Pluck Star Hand, kept struggling and thrashing within a certain range, emitting mournful cries.</p><p></p><p>It kept begging Ye Xiao not to harm it, its pitiful appearance evoking sympathy.</p><p></p><p>Seeing its desperate struggle for survival, Ye Xiao gradually fell silent.</p><p></p><p>The elixir, sensing Ye Xiao's silence, let out an even deeper mournful cry, as if trying to move Ye Xiao's merciful heart.</p><p></p><p>After a few seconds, it finally succeeded.</p><p></p><p>Ye Xiao didn't want to eat something that had consciousness, it felt like eating a living thing, which was rather repulsive.</p><p></p><p>So he clapped his palms together, crushing it into powder, and then swallowed it in one gulp.</p><p></p><p>It turned out that when eating things, it was better to kill them first, so that the psychological feeling would be more comfortable, and there wouldn't be any churning sensation in the stomach.</p><p></p><p>The elixir powder entered Ye Xiao's mouth and instantly transformed into a fluid, quickly disappearing into his body.</p><p></p><p>Boom! As soon as it entered Ye Xiao's body, its nutritional substances began to explode, forming wave after wave of extremely violent spiritual energy!</p><p></p><p>But just as it was about to erupt, all of Ye Xiao's cultivation techniques immediately activated, forming countless energy masses that quickly suppressed and devoured it.</p><p></p><p>Even when consuming the elixir refined from the Myriad Colored Leaves, Ye Xiao didn't have to exert much effort, let alone this elixir.</p><p></p><p>Here is my translation of the Chinese excerpt:</p><p></p><p>Quickly, the elixir transformed into a thick, powerful force within Ye Xiao's body, refining his meridians again and again, further elevating his physical cultivation.</p><p></p><p>Ye Xiao exhaled a breath, filled with dense spiritual energy that had formed into white mist due to its excessive concentration.</p><p></p><p>"My strength has risen to another level. I'm not far from fusing my soul and becoming a true Saint-Emperor realm expert. Originally I planned to reach Saint-Emperor in half a year, but it seems it won't even take three months now."</p><p></p><p>He smiled slightly, activated the Divine Will Technique, and returned to the city.</p><p></p><p>In a small alley in the Central State City, several strange black shadows slowly crawled out, carefully peering at the busy crowd on the street.</p><p></p><p>"Big Brother, all our Star Beast experts have been defeated. What are we still doing here?"</p><p></p><p>"You don't understand. It's precisely because they were all defeated that the human race is now intoxicated with victory and won't be on guard against us. This is the perfect opportunity for us few to come in, reap some benefits, and then escape. Isn't that wonderful?"</p><p></p><p>"Big Brother is right. We few are all Grandmaster-level Star Beasts. Even among the human race, we would be considered top-tier experts. </p><p></p><p>As long as we don't run into the Saint-Emperor realm experts of the Central State City, we won't be in any danger. Reaping some benefits and then escaping is a sure win-win."</p><p></p><p>"Big Brother has a good plan."</p><p></p><p>"Of course. This plan is the result of my careful consideration and repeated contemplation. It's absolutely foolproof. I wouldn't tell just anyone about it. I'm only bringing you few brothers along to let you reap some benefits."</p><p></p><p>"Thank you, Big Brother, for your guidance. From now on, we will look up to you as our leader."</p><p></p><p>"Sticking with the boss, you'll never go hungry."</p><p></p><p>"Enough talk. There's a human warrior approaching over there. All of you, hide your auras well. Whoever dares expose themselves, I'll kill them myself."</p><p></p><p>"Don't worry, Big Brother, we know what we're doing."</p><p></p><p>The Star Beasts' eyes shone with excitement and radiance. </p><p></p><p>They seemed to already be imagining the bountiful harvest they would reap tonight.</p><p></p><p>Damn it!</p><p></p><p>Two of the Star Beasts were even starting to drool.</p><p></p><p>The figure in the distance was approaching, not walking too slowly, but in the eyes of these Star Beasts, it was as slow as a snail, for their desire to devour the human had reached a feverish peak.</p><p></p><p>100 meters, 50 meters, 30 meters, 10 meters... Finally, the other party arrived at the mouth of the alley.</p><p></p><p>"Attack!" </p><p></p><p>The leading Star Beast suddenly shouted, and the other Star Beasts immediately followed.</p><p></p><p>Like hungry wolves pouncing on prey, they opened their bloody maws and frantically lunged at the other party.</p><p></p><p>Boom! A second later, an explosion thundered into the sky, flames bursting forth.</p><p></p><p>The surrounding residents immediately started calling the defense squad.</p><p></p><p>"Hello, defense squad? I'm reporting, there are warriors fighting and brawling. The address is... Come quickly, or they might get away."</p><p></p><p>Ye Xiao left the alley and continued walking back to the hotel. </p><p></p><p>He was somewhat puzzled - why were these Grandmaster-level Star Beasts being so bold? </p><p></p><p>Ala and the others had all been completely suppressed, yet they still dared to come here!</p><p></p><p>Thinking it over, Ye Xiao couldn't understand their reasoning, so he simply let it go.</p><p></p><p>Ten minutes later, when the defense squad arrived, they saw the ground reduced to rubble by the Star Beasts, with only a claw or two remaining, and their expressions changed drastically.</p><p></p><p>"This material? These are Grandmaster-level Star Beasts? Grandmaster-level Star Beasts have infiltrated the city, quickly, report this to the higher-ups, the entire city must be on high alert!"</p><p></p><p>The Central State City, which had just experienced a calamity, was once again tense.</p><p></p><p>On Ye Xiao's side, he had just returned to the hotel, and Yang Qian and the others had also returned.</p><p></p><p>Seeing Ye Xiao, they couldn't help but gather around him.</p><p></p><p>"Manager, where did you go? We called you but you didn't answer. We were so worried just now, thinking something had happened to you."</p><p></p><p>Ye Xiao shook his head slightly.</p><p></p><p>"I've been busy with some private matters these past few days. I made you worry."</p><p></p><p>"It's fine, as long as you're alright."</p><p></p><p>Ye Xiao nodded.</p><p></p><p>"It's late, everyone should go back and rest."</p><p></p><p>"Okay!"</p><p></p><p>The group exchanged a few courtesies and each returned to their own rooms to rest.</p><p></p><p>The following days were much more peaceful for Ye Xiao. He spent his mornings cultivating and his afternoons in the library reading books, living a quite comfortable life.</p><p></p><p>Before they knew it, twenty days had passed in a blur, and the training was over. The group would be returning to Jianghai City the next day.</p><p></p><p>On the last day before departure, Ye Xiao came to the library one last time to bid farewell to North Hall Strategy and ask him a few questions.</p>

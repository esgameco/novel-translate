        <h1>Chapter 277</h1>
        <div class="content">
            <p>Here is the full English translation of the Chinese excerpt:</p><p></p><p>Seeing Ye Xiao suddenly emerge from the mountain body, the Venerable White Tiger and Beitang Ce were startled.</p><p></p><p>"How did you get out? Weren't you supposed to come down from the celestial ladder?"</p><p></p><p>Ye Xiao shook his head.</p><p></p><p>"I have a body technique that can break through the mountain's blockade."</p><p></p><p>The Venerable White Tiger: "(⊙.⊙)!"</p><p></p><p>Beitang Ce: "(_)!"</p><p></p><p>The corners of their mouths couldn't help but twitch violently.</p><p></p><p>Although they knew Ye Xiao was very impressive, they didn't expect Ye Xiao to be so impressive, and each time he became more and more impressive, refreshing their worldview.</p><p></p><p>Now, even if Ye Xiao said he could stand here and pluck stars from the sky, they wouldn't find it strange at all.</p><p></p><p>"By the way, just now we saw a rainbow-colored divine light being released from the Long White Dragon Vein. Did you break through to the Emperor Realm and become the legendary Empyrean expert?"</p><p></p><p>Ye Xiao shook his head.</p><p></p><p>"How could I be so monstrous? I didn't absorb the entire dragon vein, I just obtained some dragon qi."</p><p></p><p>"Then what is your current cultivation level?"</p><p></p><p>"Hmm, it's just at the peak of the King Realm. I'm one step away from reaching the Emperor Realm."</p><p></p><p>The Venerable White Tiger: "(.)!"</p><p></p><p>Beitang Ce: "(.)!"</p><p></p><p>Just the peak of the King Realm, half-step into the Emperor Realm.</p><p></p><p>Can this "just" be used like that? If it weren't for the fact that they couldn't defeat him now, the White Tiger felt he really needed to have a grand battle with him, a refreshing and exhilarating fight! To let him know that some words cannot be used casually.</p><p></p><p>Ye Xiao was a bit speechless.</p><p></p><p>"What's wrong? Did I say something wrong? In fact, I was just a little lucky, with the help of the Dragon Vein senior, otherwise I would have only improved a little bit."</p><p></p><p>"You'd better not say anything else. Whatever you say now is wrong."</p><p></p><p>The Venerable White Tiger facepalmed.</p><p></p><p>"Beitang Ce, you'd better take this person away quickly. Don't let him continue to strike me. If this continues, I'm afraid I'll go crazy."</p><p></p><p>Beitang Ce nodded, tugged at Ye Xiao's sleeve and said, "Ye Xiao, let's quickly go back to Jianghai City and return the Xuanwu Seal."</p><p></p><p>Ye Xiao nodded.</p><p></p><p>"If that's the case, Senior White Tiger, we'll take our leave now."</p><p></p><p>With that, he used the Yin-Yang Escape Technique and disappeared from the spot, taking Beitang Ce with him.</p><p></p><p>Meanwhile, in Jianghai City, in the storage ring of the Venerable Xuanwu, Jiang Chen, a thunderous roar suddenly echoed from the small box.</p><p></p><p>"Damn it, that bastard actually ruined my plan at this critical moment.</p><p></p><p>Just a little bit, just a little bit more!</p><p></p><p>If Jiang Chen, that old turtle, could kill Li Liushui, the evil qi hidden in Li Liushui's body would instantly explode.</p><p></p><p>At that time, the explosion of a half-step Emperor Realm expert would be enough to injure Jiang Chen, the old turtle.</p><p></p><p>Then, I would have the opportunity to escape.</p><p></p><p>Damn it! Damn it! I didn't expect everything to end in failure in the end.</p><p></p><p>Who was it? Who actually allowed Li Liushui to reach the King Realm expert level?</p><p></p><p>Damn it, if I can catch you, I will tear you to pieces."</p><p></p><p>After the roar, he finally had to calm down.</p><p></p><p>The matter had become a fait accompli, and he had no way to overturn the situation.</p><p></p><p>"Forget it, these past few days, while there was no Xuanwu Seal, I have already assimilated this box, so even if the Xuanwu Seal comes back, it won't be able to suppress me anymore. When that time comes, it will be the day I escape.</p><p></p><p>I must make these damned human race pay in blood!"</p><p></p><p>Outside, Jiang Chen and Li Liushui were chatting.</p><p></p><p>Suddenly, the figures of Ye Xiao and Beitang Ce appeared beside them, startling the two.</p><p></p><p>"Your sudden and mysterious speed is really quite frightening."</p><p></p><p>Jiang Chen couldn't help but sneer.</p><p></p><p>Ye Xiao just smiled faintly without saying much.</p><p></p><p>As for Li Liushui, he came in front of Ye Xiao and deeply bowed to him.</p><p></p><p>"Previously, Li Certain was short-sighted and failed to recognize Ye Xiansheng as a great sage. I hope Ye Xiansheng will not take offense. This time, thanks to Ye Xiansheng's help, Li Certain was able to break through to the King Realm and save his life. The great kindness and grace are impossible to repay."</p><p></p><p>Ye Xiao gently supported him with his spiritual energy, lifting him up.</p><p></p><p>"The Dao Saber Saint need not be so polite. It was just a small matter, not worth mentioning."</p><p></p><p>Li Liushui said earnestly:</p><p></p><p>"For Ye Xiansheng, this may have been a small matter, but for Li Certain, it is a grace of saving his life and imparting teachings!</p><p></p><p>In this life, I have no way to repay it, but in the future if there is a need, Li Certain will not hesitate to give his all."</p><p></p><p>"You are overstating it."</p><p></p><p>Beitang Ce smiled.</p><p></p><p>"I'm afraid the Dao Saber Saint has the heart, but not the power."</p><p></p><p>Jiang Chen heard the hidden meaning in Beitang Ce's words, and his eyes suddenly lit up.</p><p></p><p>"Oh? Does that mean Ye Xiao has advanced further this time?"</p><p></p><p>Li Liushui's heart trembled. Ye Xiao was already a King Realm expert before, and if he advanced further, wouldn't that be that realm? The Emperor Realm! A 21-year-old Emperor Realm expert?!!! He felt his breathing freeze at that moment, and even his heartbeat seemed to stop.</p><p></p><p>This was simply unimaginable.</p><p></p><p>Ye Xiao explained, "No, it's not like that. I just improved my cultivation a bit, not to such an exaggerated extent."</p><p></p><p>Beitang Ce nodded.</p><p></p><p>"That's right, he's just reached the peak of the King Realm. It's really not that exaggerated."</p><p></p><p>The corners of Li Liushui and Jiang Chen's mouths couldn't help but twitch violently.</p><p></p><p>Here is the full English translation of the Chinese novel excerpt:</p><p></p><p>Is this not too exaggerated?</p><p></p><p>Although it is true that he has not reached the terrifying level of an Emperor Realm expert, he is still extremely powerful.</p><p></p><p>After all, Li Liushui has cultivated for several hundred years, and it was only under Ye Xiao's divine light that he managed to break through to the King Realm.</p><p></p><p>Even so, he is still only at the initial stage of the King Realm.</p><p></p><p>But what about Ye Xiao? He is only twenty-one years old, yet he has already reached the peak of the King Realm, just a step away from the Emperor Realm.</p><p></p><p>His strength is already monstrous enough.</p><p></p><p>But to think about it, Ye Xiao has been in a monstrous state from the very beginning.</p><p></p><p>He broke through to this realm in just twenty-one years, and it's unknown how quickly he has broken through each small realm.</p><p></p><p>"So this is the destruction caused by the Knife Saint Li? I don't see any casualties, so you must have evacuated the people in advance.</p><p></p><p>In that case, I don't need to use any healing arts."</p><p></p><p>Li Liushui's old face showed a slight flush.</p><p></p><p>"It was all my fault, I will personally take responsibility and rebuild Jianghai City."</p><p></p><p>As a King Realm expert, he can quickly restore the buildings of Jianghai City using his will and spiritual energy.</p><p></p><p>Ye Xiao spoke up:</p><p></p><p>"The beast disaster is imminent, and future battles may become even more intense. If the houses can be easily destroyed, it will be too troublesome to keep repairing them.</p><p></p><p>Moreover, it's not safe, as it can easily lead to the death of the warriors of Jianghai City.</p><p></p><p>Perhaps we should prepare in a different way."</p><p></p><p>The Xuanwu Venerable asked:</p><p></p><p>"How do you want to prepare?"</p><p></p><p>Ye Xiao thought for a moment.</p><p></p><p>"I want to set up some defensive formations for this city. The city has already set up many defensive formations, but their level is not strong enough.</p><p></p><p>That's one point. Another point is that those formations are mainly set up outside the city.</p><p></p><p>They can only be effective when fighting against the invasion of the star beasts.</p><p></p><p>If there is internal conflict, they will be useless. And even if the star beasts break through the outer defense, the formations outside will also be ineffective once they enter Jianghai City."</p><p></p><p>"Good! I fully agree. Whatever you need to set up the formations, just tell me. I'll have the materials directly allocated from the Nine States Alliance."</p><p></p><p>Jiang Chen's eyes lit up. He knew that Ye Xiao was proficient in formations.</p><p></p><p>He had previously seen the information about the Knife Immortal.</p><p></p><p>Among the techniques Ye Xiao knew, one of them was formations, and they were even imperial formations.</p><p></p><p>It's not easy for ordinary people to create such formations. Even the formation professors at the Capital Martial Arts University would need to work together in a group to set up an imperial formation.</p><p></p><p>But Ye Xiao could do it himself, and at a lightning-fast speed.</p><p></p><p>In this way, the entire Jianghai City will become a fortress of bronze walls and iron ramparts. When the beast disaster arrives, it will play a huge role in protecting many human beings.</p><p></p><p>Jiang Chen was more than willing.</p><p></p><p>Ye Xiao nodded.</p><p></p><p>"Since the Venerable agrees, then help me arrange a large amount of spirit stones, the more the better, and the higher the quality the better."</p><p></p><p>"No problem, I'll send a letter to the Nine States Alliance right away and have them allocate a hundred billion high-grade spirit stones over."</p><p></p><p>Ye Xiao: "(_..)!"</p><p></p><p>Sure enough, as the Xuanwu Venerable of the Nine States, he casually mentioned a hundred billion high-grade spirit stones.</p><p></p><p>Even a common one can sell for hundreds of dollars. This is high-grade, and it's a hundred billion, truly extravagant.</p><p></p><p>"Actually, you don't need that many. Although I'm setting up an imperial formation, a hundred billion high-grade spirit stones is a bit excessive."</p><p></p><p>Jiang Chen smiled and said:</p><p></p><p>"It's not excessive. In the future, if you become an Emperor Realm expert and have to fight against other Emperor Realm experts, this city may need to be reinforced many times over.</p><p></p><p>You can keep them for future reinforcement use."</p><p></p><p>After a pause, Jiang Chen couldn't help but ask again, "By the way, Ye Xiao, you're just one step away from breaking through to the Emperor Realm. Why didn't you ask the Dragon Vein Elder for more dragon qi when you were in the Dragon Vein? The dragon qi in the Long White Dragon Vein should be abundant. If you could get another wisp of it, you should be able to take that final step into the Emperor Realm."</p><p></p><p>Ye Xiao shook his head.</p><p></p><p>"The Dragon Vein Elder has already given me a lot. Asking for more would greatly harm him. Besides, this world doesn't only have his dragon qi. I can sense a very familiar aura, carrying several powerful streams of dragon qi, heading towards Jianghai City.</p><p></p><p>It won't be long before the dragon qi arrives."</p><p></p><p>At the peak of the King Realm, Ye Xiao's perception has risen again.</p><p></p><p>His perception can even sense some events in the Western region.</p><p></p><p>In the process of perception, he encountered a very familiar aura. It was the aura of the King Realm expert he had encountered when chasing Moju in the transmission array spatial tunnel.</p><p></p><p>That was the first King Realm expert he had encountered in his life.</p><p></p><p>Ye Xiao could feel that the other party now had several streams of dragon qi.</p><p></p><p>This finally made him understand why there were star beasts plundering dragon qi in the Western region.</p><p></p><p>It should be that guy, in order to find him, had specifically seized the dragon veins in the Western region to enhance his own strength.</p><p></p><p>And Ye Xiao could now sense that he was already on his way here!</p>

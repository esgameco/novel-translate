        <h1>Chapter 128</h1>
        <div class="content">
            <p>Here is the full English translation of the Chinese novel excerpt:</p><p></p><p>The Resuscitation Plan!</p><p></p><p>This is a specially established method to address the interruption in the lineage of martial arts heritage.</p><p></p><p>The physical bodies of the Saint-Monarch-level beast-spirit strongmen are divided and separately sealed underground in various cities, using their physical bodies as the formation's focal points to gather stronger Heaven and Earth spiritual energy.</p><p></p><p>Currently, only the Nine Provinces are practicing this technique.</p><p></p><p>Only the Nine Provinces possess this level of formation mastery.</p><p></p><p>Other states also have their own methods, the most famous of which is the genetic research project of the Western State, which tries to extract more energy from the beast-spirits and directly fuse it with the human body, to create powerful martial artists more quickly.</p><p></p><p>Because the Nine Provinces have sealed the Saint-Monarch beast-spirits, these beast-spirits are attempting to break through the formation by killing and collecting large amounts of fresh blood.</p><p></p><p>This is exactly the same as the method Yang Zhengyi previously used to unseal a portion of Aier King's body.</p><p></p><p>There are not just one, but multiple Saint-Emissaries of the beast-spirits in the Nine Provinces, and the number of beast-spirits exceeds hundreds of thousands.</p><p></p><p>This time, the beast-spirits will swarm out one after another to rescue these strongmen.</p><p></p><p>And through these strongmen, they will launch harassment attacks on humanity, eliminate some of the human experts, and thoroughly undermine humanity in preparation for the coming beast calamity.</p><p></p><p>It seems that the real trouble is still far from arriving.</p><p></p><p>However, one must take it step by step, and first resolve the immediate problem at hand.</p><p></p><p>At this moment, the Golden Book's divine soul has already begun to absorb and cultivate the Diabolical Heavenly Formation. Since Ye Xiao had just used his spiritual power to analyze the Diabolical Heavenly Formation, he can easily find its weaknesses.</p><p></p><p>With a thought, his spiritual power bursts forth.</p><p></p><p>Crack, crack. The Diabolical Heavenly Formation rapidly shatters, finally breaking apart like a mirror.</p><p></p><p>Plop! The Saint-Emissary of the beast-spirits plops down on the ground, and after Ye Xiao scanned his memories, his whole body seems to have collapsed, his face pale and panting heavily.</p><p></p><p>"You've won again. But winning me is useless."</p><p></p><p>The Saint-Emissary of the beast-spirits still maintains his last shred of stubbornness and dignity.</p><p></p><p>"I've already transported beast-spirit troops to cities like Lingnan and Wanghai. They will tear those human cities to shreds, and then use human blood to release Aier King.</p><p></p><p>Aier King is a Saint-Monarch strongman. He will definitely kill you.</p><p></p><p>How does that feel, human? Do you feel fear?"</p><p></p><p>"No, I'm excited."</p><p></p><p>The Saint-Emissary was stunned, completely dumbfounded by Ye Xiao.</p><p></p><p>"What nonsense are you spouting? That's a Saint-Monarch! A Saint-Monarch! Even though your cultivation is strong, you still face the danger of death before a Saint-Monarch, don't you?"</p><p></p><p>Ye Xiao ignored him, simply snapping his fingers to rescue Huan Liuli.</p><p></p><p>Huan Liuli let out a sinister chuckle.</p><p></p><p>"Idiot, my master has been wanting to eat roast lamb for a long time. If it weren't for his laziness in finding those formations, he would have personally released Aier King and barbecued him already.</p><p></p><p>Now that you've rescued him, my master is delighted."</p><p></p><p>The Saint-Emissary felt his thoughts completely shatter.</p><p></p><p>This person, had he already planned to eat Aier King?</p><p></p><p>Just who was he?</p><p></p><p>However, he suddenly burst out laughing maniacally.</p><p></p><p>"Interesting, truly interesting. Even if you don't care about Aier King, don't forget that unsealing him will result in the slaughter of over a million humans! And after Aier King is unsealed, how many more humans will be killed?</p><p></p><p>The plan of my beast-spirit tribe can still be completed."</p><p></p><p>"Who said I'm going to use human blood to unseal Aier King?"</p><p></p><p>Ye Xiao's sudden words made the Saint-Emissary's smile abruptly freeze on his face, becoming rigid.</p><p></p><p>"What do you mean?"</p><p></p><p>Ye Xiao didn't respond, only looking up at the sky.</p><p></p><p>The bewildered Saint-Emissary looked up as well, and his eyes immediately widened, his pupils constricting, his whole body feeling as if it had fallen into an icy abyss.</p><p></p><p>Above the ravine, countless sword beams had gathered, numbering in the hundreds of thousands!</p><p></p><p>Each of these sword beams contained power capable of easily destroying a Patriarch-level expert! Even more terrifying, in the next moment, they moved, like shooting stars, no, like a swarm of shooting stars, flying rapidly in all directions.</p><p></p><p>Those directions were precisely the cities of Lingnan, Wanghai, and others.</p><p></p><p>"Noâ€”!"</p><p></p><p>The Saint-Emissary screamed in utter despair.</p><p></p><p>He finally understood why Ye Xiao had never shown any signs of tension.</p><p></p><p>It wasn't that he didn't care about the slaughter of the human race, but because the human race would not be slaughtered at all!</p><p></p><p>He wanted to unseal Aier King, but he wasn't going to use human blood to do it. He was going to use the blood of the beast-spirits!</p><p></p><p>No wonder! Even though he had already sent Huan Liuli as a mole, he still didn't stop the other cities, allowing the beast-spirit army to be released. It was only at the Jianghai City that he hurried over.</p><p></p><p>He had planned this all along!</p><p></p><p>He intentionally let all the beast-spirits reach the nearby cities and be killed at specific locations.</p><p></p><p>This person, he had calculated the plan from the very beginning, and all the hundreds of thousands of beast-spirits had become his playthings, manipulated in the palm of his hand!</p><p></p><p>At this moment, Ye Xiao...</p><p></p><p>Here is the full English translation of the Chinese excerpt:</p><p></p><p>Huan Liuli's gaze once again fell upon him, causing his body to involuntarily shudder once more. What kind of gaze was that? Dim green, filled with greed and desire.</p><p></p><p>"What do you all want to do?"</p><p></p><p>He couldn't help but retreat slightly, while Ye Xiao's mouth curled up into a seemingly warm but deeply chilling smile.</p><p></p><p>"Liuli, get the pot ready! Time for a red-braised turtle!"</p><p></p><p>"Alright!"</p><p></p><p>In the city of Lingnan, the Star Beast troops had already fully arrived, like detonating an explosion in the city center, instantly plunging the entire Lingnan City into an intensely heated state of war.</p><p></p><p>"Hurry! All the cultivators inside the city center must evacuate and form a surrounding cordon on the outskirts, absolutely cannot let these Star Beasts spread out, make them disappear in this area, don't let them harm the human race."</p><p></p><p>"No, there are too many Star Beasts, we can't hold out much longer!"</p><p></p><p>"There are even Patriarch-level Star Beasts in there, no, Grand Patriarchs, Grand Star Beasts!"</p><p></p><p>"Retreat! Retreat quickly!"</p><p></p><p>The human race was thrown into panic, no one had expected there to be so many Star Beasts suddenly erupting.</p><p></p><p>The number of Star Beasts was too dense, their attacks too numerous and dazzling, leaving them unable to take care of themselves.</p><p></p><p>Under the seven-star constellation, the eyes of the Star Beasts began to turn red, like blood-thirsty fierce beasts, ravenous to the extreme.</p><p></p><p>The originally Post-Celestial First-Grade Star Beasts had been amplified to Post-Celestial Third and Fourth Grade.</p><p></p><p>The originally Post-Celestial Fifth-Grade Star Beasts had already been amplified to above Seventh Grade.</p><p></p><p>Although there were only a little over 20,000 Star Beasts, their numbers were far inferior to the humans, but their cultivation was far beyond the average human level.</p><p></p><p>It could be foreseen that tonight, a great calamity would descend upon the human race in many cities.</p><p></p><p>But at this moment, suddenly from the sky above, a series of dazzling sword beams like shooting stars appeared.</p><p></p><p>"What is that?"</p><p></p><p>Some human cultivators had already noticed the sword beams, and the Star Beasts had also noticed them.</p><p></p><p>The speed of those sword beams was extremely fast, comparable to lightning, rushing over in an instant, and in the eyes of all the Star Beasts, they grew larger and larger!</p><p></p><p>Boom, boom, boom...</p><p></p><p>In a flash, the sword light like a dragon formed a towering light column that enveloped all the Star Beasts.</p><p></p><p>Explosive sounds, agonizing cries, one after another.</p><p></p><p>Countless Star Beasts, before they could even display their full might, were instantly blasted into corpses.</p><p></p><p>The shockwaves spread, ruthlessly destroying the buildings, dust and smoke rising.</p><p></p><p>A human Patriarch shouted, "Hurry! Retreat! All of you retreat, human Patriarchs, deploy barriers, divert the shockwaves upward!"</p><p></p><p>Before the seven-star constellation began, the Alliance had withdrawn a small portion of military forces from the battlefield and sent a few Patriarchs to assist in various places, and now they were put to use.</p><p></p><p>Several Patriarchs unleashed their spiritual energy, although they couldn't completely change the direction of all the shockwaves, at least they could weaken them somewhat.</p><p></p><p>The shockwaves struck, the Patriarchs retreated repeatedly, their vital energy churning.</p><p></p><p>But the attack plunged straight into the ground, the earth bearing most of the impact, and the shockwaves were somewhat weakened.</p><p></p><p>The Patriarchs were pushed back nearly a hundred meters before finally stopping.</p><p></p><p>They looked at each other, all seeing the terror in each other's eyes!</p><p></p><p>How terrifying!</p><p></p><p>Just the aftershock of the battle was able to reach this level, and this was with the ground absorbing a large portion of the shockwaves, if it had hit them directly, they might have been reduced to ashes!</p><p></p><p>Who was it?</p><p></p><p>Who had such great power?</p><p></p><p>The shockwaves lasted for dozens of seconds, and only when the last few sword beams stopped did it gradually subside, but the ground and buildings were still trembling slightly.</p><p></p><p>The dust and smoke continued to spread outward.</p><p></p><p>The Patriarchs gulped, exchanging glances.</p><p></p><p>"Let's go up and take a look."</p><p></p><p>They flew up quickly, but when they arrived at the giant crater, they were once again stunned, their souls shaking, their bodies covered in goosebumps!</p><p></p><p>The ground had been blasted into a 500-meter deep giant crater, vertical like a cliff.</p><p></p><p>In the crater, the blood of the Star Beasts had formed a pool.</p><p></p><p>Over 20,000 Star Beasts, including Patriarch-level experts and even a Grand Patriarch Star Beast, had been completely annihilated in just tens of seconds.</p><p></p><p>This was simply miraculous.</p><p></p><p>"Who did this? Could it be a divine Patriarch who descended upon Lingnan City?"</p><p></p><p>"I don't know. But whoever it was, they are the benefactor of Lingnan City."</p><p></p><p>Over 20,000 Star Beasts, and their strength had been amplified by the seven-star constellation.</p><p></p><p>If the other party hadn't intervened, Lingnan City might have suffered countless human casualties today! But the survivors, relieved to have escaped the disaster, did not see the blood slowly seeping into the land beneath the city.</p>

        <h1>Chapter 36</h1>
        <div class="content">
            <p>Here is the full English translation of the excerpt from the Chinese novel:</p><p></p><p>Ning Yuhen wiped the cold sweat from his forehead, then shook his head and began to recount the books again, while Ye Xiao slightly raised his eyebrows and began to ponder.</p><p></p><p>"The map of King Aier, what is that thing?" </p><p></p><p>He had been in the library for so long, but had never heard of this before.</p><p></p><p>However, if it was not something good, that Tiger Cheng's soul body would not have come all the way here specifically.</p><p></p><p>Moreover, judging from what it said just now, the map of King Aier is stored on the upper level of the library.</p><p></p><p>The files and techniques stored there are all highly confidential.</p><p></p><p>This made Ye Xiao quite interested in the map of King Aier.</p><p></p><p>It seems that there is an opportunity to investigate it further.</p><p></p><p>At the same time, in a corner of the suburbs of Jianghai City, in a small secluded house, a figure in black suddenly stood up.</p><p></p><p>The servant sitting cross-legged beside him couldn't help but ask in confusion:</p><p></p><p>"Master, what's wrong?"</p><p></p><p>"The soul body of Iron Tiger has been extinguished."</p><p></p><p>"What!"</p><p></p><p>The servant was immediately shocked.</p><p></p><p>"Iron Tiger's soul body has already reached the peak of the extraordinary level, just one step away from stepping into the Xiantian realm and becoming a Sect Master soul body. </p><p></p><p>If there is no great Sect Master expert or a spiritual cultivator above the Sect Master level in the library, it would be impossible to extinguish him!"</p><p></p><p>"It should be the same person who ruined my plan last time, the one who killed the mutant Sect Master beast with a single strike."</p><p></p><p>"The place where he struck last time was also near the library, could it be someone in the library?"</p><p></p><p>"I don't know for sure, but there's an 80% chance. If it is indeed him guarding the library, then the map can no longer be taken out. It seems we need to activate the last plan of the WujiƒÅn project."</p><p></p><p>On Ye Xiao's side, he had been reading books for about two hours when Gu Hai finally arrived late.</p><p></p><p>This guy was newly married, with many joyous events, and his steps were somewhat flamboyant.</p><p></p><p>"Old Ye, I just went to Old Yang's place to resign, and he said you got promoted! Wow, your wife has become the mistress, you've finally made it big."</p><p></p><p>"The salary increase is not much, I just need to work two more days a week, and if I work overtime on weekends with double pay, the salary increase is actually not that much."</p><p></p><p>"Look on the bright side, even a small mosquito is still meat. By the way, yesterday when you sent Qin Yuyuan back, did anything happen?"</p><p></p><p>"What should have happened?"</p><p></p><p>"Of course, discuss some philosophy of life, and at the same time exercise the body, to make a great contribution to the great cause of increasing the population of our motherland."</p><p></p><p>"You're overthinking it."</p><p></p><p>"Old Ye, you're not doing well here. Such a good opportunity is right in front of you, but you're not taking it, what a waste."</p><p></p><p>Ye Xiao glanced at Gu Hai impatiently.</p><p></p><p>"Is there nothing else in your brain other than that kind of thing?"</p><p></p><p>Gu Hai frowned.</p><p></p><p>"Old Ye, you don't appreciate a good friend. If we weren't such good brothers, would I be helping you with this good opportunity? </p><p></p><p>Qin Yuyuan is a standard rich and beautiful girl, and also a martial arts genius. She's been pure and untouched since childhood, never had a boyfriend.</p><p></p><p>If you marry her, you'll be able to wake up smiling every day. How many years do you have to struggle? You'll never have to worry about food and drink, and there will be someone to take care of you. It's a dream come true for you.</p><p></p><p>I'm telling you, once this chance is gone, it won't come again. Among the entire Jiangcheng Martial Arts Academy, there are at least ten thousand people eyeing her, this swan.</p><p></p><p>Here is the full English translation of the Chinese excerpt:</p><p></p><p>"There are also eight thousand."</p><p></p><p>"Don't be so ungrateful, let go of this great marriage opportunity."</p><p></p><p>"Alright, you don't need to worry so much, you're acting like an old mother hen when it comes to getting married. Did you pass the Defense Corps exam? What was your score?"</p><p></p><p>Gu Hai: "..."</p><p></p><p>"If we don't talk about the scores, we're still good brothers."</p><p></p><p>"Did you kneel?"</p><p></p><p>Gu Hai nodded.</p><p></p><p>"My cultivation was a bit lacking, so my parents didn't want me to go to the front lines, so I wasted a lot. But my father-in-law used his connections in the Defense Corps to pull some strings, he's an old member there, so they'll give him a bit of face. I'll get it sorted out tonight, and start work officially tomorrow."</p><p></p><p>"That's good. After joining the Defense Corps, it won't be like here, the Defense Corps not only has to deal with criminal cultivators, but also guard against star beasts and tiger spirits, so you'll need to be more vigilant."</p><p></p><p>"I understand, I'll be going now, we'll keep in touch when we have the chance."</p><p></p><p>"Mm, be careful on your way."</p><p></p><p>It was a morning filled with trivial matters, and Ye Xiao hadn't been able to read more than a few books, so he couldn't find a fundamental cultivation method.</p><p></p><p>However, when he went to the cafeteria for lunch, his cultivation, unexpectedly, broke through again, which put him in a rather good mood.</p><p></p><p>Even before Gu Hai's marriage, he had already broken through to the Xiantian Second Rank, and in just over a month, he had broken through again, now reaching the Xiantian Third Rank, at the peak of the Patriarch realm.</p><p></p><p>If he were to break through further, his cultivation would successfully enter the Great Patriarch realm! Reaching the Great Patriarch realm, one's spiritual power would also undergo a tremendous increase.</p><p></p><p>When attacking, a bit of spiritual power attack would be added.</p><p></p><p>This is one of the differences between a Patriarch and a Great Patriarch.</p><p></p><p>It's not just a huge difference in the amount of spiritual energy, but also a fundamental change.</p><p></p><p>Of course, Ye Xiao wasn't very interested in this, because he had cultivated the supreme spiritual cultivation method, Taixuan Tiangong. The Golden Book Shen Hun Fusion technique was an extremely high-quality existence in the spiritual cultivation realm, and he should be able to contend with those at a higher level.</p><p></p><p>Even the spiritual power of a Great Patriarch wouldn't be a concern for him in the slightest.</p><p></p><p>What he cared about was that after reaching the Great Patriarch realm, one could break free from the constraints of gravity, step on the spiritual energy, and soar through the skies!</p><p></p><p>Flying!</p><p></p><p>This is a wish that all humans have, to completely break free from the constraints of this world, and reach a realm that is unprecedented and inconceivable.</p><p></p><p>After finishing lunch, he returned to the library.</p><p></p><p>But this time, he didn't go to read books, but instead used the library's query system to look up information about Aier King.</p><p></p><p>Last time, because he didn't pay attention, that tiger spirit who entered the Defense Corps ended up causing a small-scale beast disaster, which even put him in danger.</p><p></p><p>This time, a more powerful tiger spirit soul has come, and what it's looking for is definitely more important than what that previous tiger spirit did.</p><p></p><p>The computer system quickly found an ancient book, not too old, written about 140 years ago, called "Legends Under the Starry Sky", the author's name was not recorded, probably for some special reason.</p><p></p><p>But there was a small part about the Aier King.</p><p></p><p>Ye Xiao opened the first page, and was greeted by a highly aged illustration, depicting a group of cultivators resisting the invasion of a star beast army, with a rather tragic feel to it.</p><p></p><p>Then the second page was the main text.</p><p></p><p>"It was a spring when the plants had just revived, and all things were reborn..."</p><p></p><p>(This chapter ends)</p>

        <h1>Chapter 198</h1>
        <div class="content">
            <p>Here is the full English translation of the Chinese excerpt:</p><p></p><p>"Indeed, the spiritual energy in nature is far superior to that in the city. No wonder the big cities have to construct spiritual gathering formations."</p><p></p><p>Walking on the ancient path in the forest, feeling the surging spiritual energy, Ye Xiao finally understood why the cities had to build spiritual gathering formations.</p><p></p><p>Although the building materials were good, they still blocked the influx of spiritual energy. At the same time, humans could not possibly hide in these deep mountains to cultivate.</p><p></p><p>Considering various factors, the spiritual gathering formation was the best choice.</p><p></p><p>At this time, on the ancient path, although there were not many people, it was not completely deserted either. From time to time, one or two figures could be seen passing by quickly.</p><p></p><p>Ye Xiao swept with the Taixuan Tiangong, and knew that there were quite a few people coming.</p><p></p><p>It's just that not many people were walking on the ancient path.</p><p></p><p>A large part of the entrants were walking in the forest.</p><p></p><p>Like the Forest Sea, which was a natural treasure trove, filled with treasures everywhere, walking in the forest, one might have the luck to find some heavenly materials and earthly treasures.</p><p></p><p>For example, ginseng and lingzhi that were decades old.</p><p></p><p>Although the value of these things was not high, for some cultivators with relatively shallow attainments, they could still be considered quite good resources.</p><p></p><p>Moreover, if it was in a slightly deeper forest, there was a chance to find heavenly materials and earthly treasures of even higher years.</p><p></p><p>Of course, the deeper you go, the more dangerous it would be.</p><p></p><p>In these deep mountains and ancient forests lacking human habitation, there were many star beasts or semi-beastmen lurking.</p><p></p><p>Because there were still many heavenly materials and earthly treasures here, the Human Clan Alliance would also collect some resources from here, so they would never conduct large-scale hunting, so as not to destroy the environment.</p><p></p><p>Moreover, from a certain perspective, the star beasts were also part of the resources. Their star cores, flesh and blood, and bones and skins were all crucial for the cultivation of the Human Clan.</p><p></p><p>In order to better manage the Forest Sea, the Nine States Alliance used formations to build a huge isolation belt within the Forest Sea.</p><p></p><p>On the one hand, it was to prevent the Human Clan from hunting and killing indiscriminately, so that the resources would not be over-consumed.</p><p></p><p>On the other hand, it was also to prevent the star beasts and semi-beastmen inside from breaking out.</p><p></p><p>At the same time, experts at the Divine Ancestor level were arranged in the Forest Sea to maintain order.</p><p></p><p>To enter, one had to go through the approval of the Nine States Alliance.</p><p></p><p>Many cultivators would just look around outside, not daring to venture inside rashly.</p><p></p><p>But there were also some bold ones who would apply to enter the formation.</p><p></p><p>After all, the good things were all in the inner circle of the Forest Sea.</p><p></p><p>It's just that life and death are destined, and wealth and nobility are in heaven. Whether one can find the heavenly materials and earthly treasures, or whether one can get out after finding them, is not something anyone can guarantee.</p><p></p><p>Ye Xiao was not interested in these peripheral matters. He released his divine sense and found that there were people gathering about 20 kilometers ahead, which should be the entrance of the alliance's formation. </p><p></p><p>With a thought, he activated the Shenyi Technique and disappeared from the spot, reappearing at that place.</p><p></p><p>There were quite a few people, at least a thousand or so, and it was already night.</p><p></p><p>Probably many of them were making a living here.</p><p></p><p>"Everyone, don't crowd, line up one by one.</p><p></p><p>The interior of the Forest Sea is extremely dangerous, and cultivators are not allowed to enter alone. You must find a team of at least ten people. </p><p></p><p>And those whose cultivation is not above the Fifth Realm of the Transcendent Stage are not allowed to enter after 6 o'clock in the evening. You can come back tomorrow."</p><p></p><p>A staff member was holding a megaphone, shouting the rules to the crowd in front.</p><p></p><p>Some experienced old-timers had already formed small groups and were waiting in line to enter, while others who didn't know the rules were a bit troubled, standing at the entrance, scratching their heads, not knowing what to do.</p><p></p><p>Some slightly smarter ones started to look for teams, but it wasn't easy, because most of the people forming teams were really in need of teammates, as their strength was quite ordinary. If the teammates they found were not strong enough, there was a real possibility of death inside the Forest Sea.</p><p></p><p>This reminded Ye Xiao of the scenes in his previous life when he was playing games, unable to complete a dungeon, and shouting at the dungeon entrance to recruit teammates to grind.</p><p></p><p>But back then, it was mainly to earn game currency to sell for medical expenses.</p><p></p><p>Now, he didn't need to worry about that anymore.</p><p></p><p>Just as he was about to use the Taixuan Tiangong to modify the memories of one of the small teams and blend in with them to enter...</p><p></p><p>A middle-aged uncle with a hairstyle like Zhong Kui came over and smiled, saying, "Friend, do you want to join a team? We are from the Chenglong Mercenary Company, and our team has specialized experts who can escort you."</p><p></p><p>For capitalists, wherever there is demand, there they will be.</p><p></p><p>Some mercenary companies saw the business opportunity here and started the business of leading people in.</p><p></p><p>"No, thank you."</p><p></p><p>The other party also seemed to be an old hand, and seeing Ye Xiao's intention, quickly said, "Friend, don't misunderstand, we are not the kind of mercenary company that charges money. We just want to gather enough people to go in.</p><p></p><p>After going in, you can choose to continue teaming up with us, or you can choose to go on your own."</p><p></p><p>Here is my translation of the Chinese excerpt:</p><p></p><p>Ye Xiao didn't expect it to be this way, but that was fine, it saved him the trouble.</p><p></p><p>He nodded.</p><p></p><p>The other person saw his agreement and grinned, revealing two rows of large, gapped teeth.</p><p></p><p>"Your cultivation has already reached the late Heavenly Fifth Rank, right?"</p><p></p><p>Ye Xiao nodded again.</p><p></p><p>"Alright then, our group is now complete. Let's go!"</p><p></p><p>The other person led Ye Xiao to his team, which had eight people, both men and women. Adding the two of them, there were now ten people total, just the right number.</p><p></p><p>It was enough to meet the official requirements.</p><p></p><p>"By the way, friend, what's your name? I'll fill out the registration form."</p><p></p><p>Ye Xiao thought for a moment and said, "Da Xiong!"</p><p></p><p>The other person knew Ye Xiao was using a fake name, even though Ye Xiao had already disguised himself. But with his handsome looks, how could he possibly be called such an old-fashioned name? Not that it mattered, someone like this veteran would easily handle the registration form.</p><p></p><p>"Okay, I'll go register. By the way, my name is Huang Tao, remember it so you don't slip up later."</p><p></p><p>While he went to register, Ye Xiao glanced over the entire team. There were three women, the rest were men. Most of them looked to be around forty years old.</p><p></p><p>Since their cultivation was not very high, mostly just above the late Heavenly Fifth Rank, the strongest one was the team leader Huang Tao, who was at the late Heavenly Eighth Rank.</p><p></p><p>So their appearances had not maintained much youthfulness.</p><p></p><p>The only one who looked relatively young was a girl with a white veil covering her face, seemingly trying to conceal her features.</p><p></p><p>It seemed she sensed Ye Xiao's gaze, and the next moment, she swept a glance at him.</p><p></p><p>Those extremely lively eyes flashed briefly.</p><p></p><p>The next instant, a powerful and strange force instantly enveloped Ye Xiao.</p><p></p><p>Ye Xiao's heart suddenly trembled. </p><p></p><p>Wow, she was actually an expert! That power was somewhat like spiritual force, but not entirely.</p><p></p><p>However, although she was very strong, she still lacked the necessary level compared to Ye Xiao, and was unable to see through his cultivation.</p><p></p><p>Ye Xiao's expression did not change at all, as if he had not noticed her power at all.</p><p></p><p>Therefore, the girl simply looked at him briefly, then turned her gaze back to the depths of the ancient forest sea, pondering something unknown.</p><p></p><p>Soon, Huang Tao returned with a form, smiling as he approached.</p><p></p><p>"Alright, we can go in now."</p><p></p><p>Everyone followed him and entered the gate, quickly arriving within the forest sea.</p><p></p><p>After entering, the veiled girl didn't say a word, just walked away directly.</p><p></p><p>Apparently, she was also someone Huang Tao had temporarily recruited.</p><p></p><p>The other four people also left after briefly speaking with Huang Tao.</p><p></p><p>It seemed that this time, in addition to Huang Tao himself, he had only brought four of his own people.</p><p></p><p>"Friend, are you going with us or on your own? If you don't mind, I'd advise you to stick with us, because it's very dangerous in here, especially at night."</p><p></p><p>Ye Xiao shook his head.</p><p></p><p>"I'll go on my own."</p><p></p><p>"Alright then."</p><p></p><p>"But before I go, I have a question. When I came, I saw a lot of people here, and it's so late, with so many people outside. Is there some other reason for that?"</p><p></p><p>"You don't know?"</p><p></p><p>Huang Tao was somewhat surprised.</p><p></p><p>Ye Xiao shook his head again.</p><p></p><p>"I'm not very clear, this is my first time coming here."</p><p></p><p>"Okay, no wonder you don't know. Recently, there's a possibility that an extremely powerful natural treasure may manifest in the forest sea, so that's why so many people have rushed over. </p><p></p><p>They all want to try their luck."</p><p></p><p>Ye Xiao's eyes flickered.</p><p></p><p>"What kind of natural treasure?"</p><p></p><p>"I don't know the specifics. But even if there is a powerful natural treasure, it's basically irrelevant to people like us. </p><p></p><p>That thing is definitely deep in the forest sea, a place we can't reach."</p><p></p><p>"Do you know if there are any flowers in the forest sea? Like climbing flowers or the like, that strongly absorb spiritual energy?"</p><p></p><p>"Oh, I do know a bit about that. If you head southeast from here, they say some people have found quite a few flowers with strong spiritual energy there.</p><p></p><p>Apparently, some have even found entire patches of such flowers.</p><p></p><p>But you need to be careful, that area has seen a lot of trouble lately, with beast disturbances. My sister's ex-girlfriend even died there a few days ago."</p><p></p><p>"Okay, thank you."</p><p></p><p>With a simple response, Ye Xiao bid farewell to him and turned to leave.</p><p></p><p>Huang Tao couldn't help shaking his head.</p><p></p><p>"The young these days are really getting more and more bold, daring to venture into the forest sea alone. We're getting old."</p>

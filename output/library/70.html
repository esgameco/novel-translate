        <h1>Chapter 70</h1>
        <div class="content">
            <p>Here is the full English translation of the Chinese novel excerpt:</p><p></p><p>"Manager, you're here."</p><p></p><p>Seeing Ye Xiao arrive, Ning Yushen immediately sat up from the bed.</p><p></p><p>Ye Xiao waved his hand.</p><p></p><p>"No need to be so polite, just lie down and don't move your wound."</p><p></p><p>"It's fine, I'm not in much trouble anymore."</p><p></p><p>Ye Xiao put down his things and simply asked a few questions about the injury. Ning Yushen responded with a few words here and there, obviously a bit distracted, or perhaps worried that Ye Xiao would ask about his origins.</p><p></p><p>After a few questions, Ye Xiao said:</p><p></p><p>"Are you ready to rest? Shall I go back to the library first?"</p><p></p><p>Ning Yushen gritted his teeth and couldn't help but say:</p><p></p><p>"Manager, aren't you the least bit curious about what happened last night?"</p><p></p><p>"What's there to be curious about? Everyone has their own secrets. If you want to tell me, you would have told me already. If you don't want to tell me, even if I ask, you'll just give me some lies to fend me off."</p><p></p><p>Ning Yushen clenched the bedsheet, and after a long while, he let out a long sigh.</p><p></p><p>"Manager, to be honest, your mentality is the best I've encountered among all people. Sometimes I even suspect that you are a reclusive sage, having seen the ups and downs of life, the glory and decline, so your attitude towards life is always so calm and gentle, making others envious."</p><p></p><p>"Like me, someone who can't even awaken their spiritual power, no matter how hard I try, it's better to just lie down."</p><p></p><p>Ning Yushen shook his head.</p><p></p><p>"Manager, don't sell yourself short. Honestly, if you could cultivate, your future achievements would definitely not be low. Your character is too strong."</p><p></p><p>After a pause, he continued:</p><p></p><p>"Maybe it's all fate, the heavens won't let everyone be perfect. Your character is so good, but you can't cultivate; I have talent, but I can't cultivate openly. The heavens love to tease people."</p><p></p><p>Seeing him staring blankly, Ye Xiao stood up.</p><p></p><p>"Alright, don't be so melancholic, focus on recovering and try to get back to work as soon as possible. I've gotten you three days of sick leave here."</p><p></p><p>"Thank you, Manager."</p><p></p><p>"You're welcome."</p><p></p><p>With that, Ye Xiao turned to leave, but Ning Yushen quickly called out to him.</p><p></p><p>"Manager."</p><p></p><p>Ye Xiao turned back, and Ning Yushen said solemnly:</p><p></p><p>"If one day you find out that I've hidden something very important from you, will you hate me?"</p><p></p><p>"No."</p><p></p><p>"Why?"</p><p></p><p>"You're not as handsome as me, not as rich as me, and not as manly as me. Why would I hate someone who's inferior to me?"</p><p></p><p>Ning Yushen was a bit amused and distressed.</p><p></p><p>"Manager, you really know how to hit where it hurts!"</p><p></p><p>"Mm, I'll be going now."</p><p></p><p>Ye Xiao returned to the library and continued reading books.</p><p></p><p>After being promoted to manager, he basically just let the subordinate administrators handle things, he didn't need to get involved.</p><p></p><p>So after reading all the books related to body cultivation techniques in his own area, Ye Xiao quickly found a total of eight body cultivation technique manuals from other areas.</p><p></p><p>With this, the golden book in his hand began to emit an intermittent golden glow, indicating that he was missing just one more body cultivation technique manual to complete the set.</p><p></p><p>He didn't know what cultivation technique the completed set would be.</p><p></p><p>Currently, he already possessed the Battle System's Tyrannical Saber, Heavenly Slash, the Heart Cultivation System's Purple Cosmos Sea, the Spiritual System's Grand Heavenly Dipper, and the Healing System's Heavenly Restoration.</p><p></p><p>Each of these five techniques was a true masterpiece.</p><p></p><p>Here is the full English translation of the Chinese excerpt:</p><p></p><p>This martial art technique far surpasses the level of cultivation in this world. </p><p></p><p>It can allow me to unleash power that exceeds my current level.</p><p></p><p>The body cultivation technique I'm about to refine also shouldn't be too shabby.</p><p></p><p>I wonder how much speed boost it will give me? My current speed is already supersonic, and if I can take it one step further, can I catch up to lightning? Then I'll be like the Flash! As my strength increases, the power unleashed by the cultivation technique will become stronger and stronger.</p><p></p><p>Moreover, I don't know if the technique can be further integrated. If I can integrate an even more powerful cultivation technique, will I eventually be able to reach the speed of light? Or even faster than light? Then if I let out a fart and unleash the technique, I might be able to circle the earth and still smell it when I get back. But that's probably not very realistic.</p><p></p><p>After all, the body cultivation technique is not teleportation.</p><p></p><p>There are still speed limits to the body cultivation technique. The distance from supersonic to the speed of light is still very far. Reaching the speed of light is still a long way off, not to mention exceeding it. </p><p></p><p>I've heard that spatial array techniques can achieve instantaneous long-distance teleportation, but the lowest level of spatial cultivation techniques is classified, and even the library in Jianghai City doesn't have them. If I want to learn them, I won't have the opportunity.</p><p></p><p>I'll take it one step at a time. When my strength is greater in the future, I'll eventually be able to learn them.</p><p></p><p>Thinking this, Ye Xiao opened another body cultivation technique manual, and the golden book suddenly trembled, making Ye Xiao's face light up with joy.</p><p></p><p>This is the final body cultivation technique.</p><p></p><p>"Oh, if it isn't my little brother Ye Xiao, what brings you here to Sister Wang's place?"</p><p></p><p>Ye Xiao: "???"</p><p></p><p>This voice made him involuntarily raise his eyebrows a bit. He had been so engrossed in reading that he didn't realize he had come to this flirtatious woman's territory.</p><p></p><p>A miscalculation!</p><p></p><p>He looked up and saw that Sister Wang was dressed as usual.</p><p></p><p>The top half was a tight-fitting blouse, wearing a black work blazer, and the bottom half was a mini skirt that barely covered her knees. Her long legs were wrapped in pale white stockings, and she was wearing fluffy high heels that clicked on the tile floor.</p><p></p><p>This kind of work attire is not expensive, and it's quite formal, but for some reason, when worn by Sister Wang, it gives the opposite impression.</p><p></p><p>Perhaps it's because a certain indecent culture from the east has been constantly exporting many improper concepts.</p><p></p><p>Not to mention that all major websites have a separate section for work attire, on par with regional specialties or local selfies. Even in many niche categories, work attire often makes cameo appearances, such as in stories about a not-so-cold state, private tutors, or time freezing.</p><p></p><p>Sister Wang sat down across from Ye Xiao, and a strong scent of Chanel perfume wafted over. She gave a slight smile, her crescent-shaped eyes full of allure for men.</p><p></p><p>Ye Xiao just glanced at her and then lowered his head to continue reading his book.</p><p></p><p>Sister Wang didn't get angry. She leaned on the table, resting her chin on her right hand, still smiling at Ye Xiao.</p><p></p><p>"Little brother Ye Xiao, why are you always reading books? What's so good about books?"</p><p></p><p>"There's a golden house hidden in books."</p><p></p><p>"Hehe, building a golden house to hide your sweetheart? Why bother? Just come to Sister Wang's place, and I'll open any door you want."</p><p></p><p>Suddenly, Ye Xiao felt a tickling sensation on his leg. He scanned with his spiritual sense and found that Wang Na had somehow taken off her high heels and was lightly kicking his calf with her stockinged toes.</p><p></p><p>He pushed his chair back slightly to avoid Wang Na.</p><p></p><p>"Sister Wang's pond is too deep, and my little frame can't even stir up the water. You should seek a more accomplished partner."</p><p></p><p>(End of chapter)</p>

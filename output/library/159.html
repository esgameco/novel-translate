        <h1>Chapter 159</h1>
        <div class="content">
            <p>Here is the full English translation of the Chinese excerpt:</p><p></p><p>This technique is simply an astounding divine creation.</p><p></p><p>And the sword intent contained in the sword beam he just unleashed is also no ordinary thing.</p><p></p><p>Among the Nine Provinces, those who can reach this level in cultivating sword intent must be one of those two. This is the first time in Ye Xiao's life that he has seen such a top-tier expert.</p><p></p><p>Truly powerful!</p><p></p><p>If even his clone is this strong, how powerful must his true body be? Wouldn't that be simply heaven-defying?</p><p></p><p>Indeed, the Nine Provinces are teeming with talented individuals.</p><p></p><p>I'm still a bit lacking.</p><p></p><p>Looks like I'll have to read more books every day, adding an extra hour each day.</p><p></p><p>Let's see if I can reach the peak of the Celestial Sovereign realm within half a year.</p><p></p><p>Then I can consider breaking through to the King Realm!</p><p></p><p>"Your sword dao cultivation is truly impressive, to have reached this level at such a young age. It truly impresses me," said the Sword Saint Lu Qingshan.</p><p></p><p>So it is indeed the Sword Saint Lu Qingshan.</p><p></p><p>Ye Xiao thought to himself.</p><p></p><p>Someone surnamed Lu, who cultivates the sword, and is this strong - it can only be Lu Qingshan.</p><p></p><p>But it doesn't matter, since I used a disguise technique, he doesn't know who I really am. </p><p></p><p>After I return to the Jianghai City and restore my true appearance, I can just quietly hide in the library and read books without worrying about him causing me trouble.</p><p></p><p>"The Sword Saint is too kind."</p><p></p><p>"You know me."</p><p></p><p>Lu Qingshan was a bit surprised.</p><p></p><p>"Sword Saint Lu Qingshan, the 9th ranked expert on the World Dragon Ranking, naturally your junior knows of you."</p><p></p><p>Lu Qingshan was silent for a moment, looking a bit awkward.</p><p></p><p>"The 9th ranked one is my close friend, the Dao God Li Liushui. I am only ranked 10th."</p><p></p><p>Ye Xiao: "(￣0 ￣)y!"</p><p></p><p>How embarrassing, to get their rankings wrong on our first meeting.</p><p></p><p>"Cough cough, no matter, it's only a difference of one rank."</p><p></p><p>Lu Qingshan nodded, not delving deeper, and spoke again:</p><p></p><p>"Since you are a sword dao expert, why did you just now stop me from killing those few Saint Beasts?"</p><p></p><p>Ye Xiao glanced down below.</p><p></p><p>"This junior recently needs to refine some medicinal pills. I need those three Saint Sovereign level Saint Beasts as materials, so I had to stop Senior Lu's hand, I hope you don't mind."</p><p></p><p>"I see, as long as it's for the benefit of the Nine Provinces, it doesn't matter who takes action."</p><p></p><p>"Thank you."</p><p></p><p>The three Saint Sovereign Saint Beasts below, hearing the conversation between the two, were utterly devastated.</p><p></p><p>They had thought they had found a savior, but it turned out they had just escaped the wolf's den only to enter the tiger's den.</p><p></p><p>"This person's strength is extremely powerful, even stronger than Lu Qingshan's clone. It seems we three are doomed today. Scatter and flee, whoever can escape is lucky."</p><p></p><p>The three Saint Beasts communicated through spiritual thoughts, and immediately prepared to unleash their movement techniques to flee.</p><p></p><p>But unfortunately, when Ye Xiao arrived in this area, he had already used the Taixuan Tiangong to tightly lock them down. Even the slightest movement or spiritual communication would be completely captured by Ye Xiao without missing a single word.</p><p></p><p>So the moment they prepared to flee, Ye Xiao instantly launched his attack.</p><p></p><p>The battle-hardened Sword Saint Lu Qingshan naturally also sensed the three Saint Beasts' intention to escape. He was just about to remind Ye Xiao, but before he could even open his mouth, countless sword beams shot out from beneath Ye Xiao's feet the next moment.</p><p></p><p>Boom boom boom...</p><p></p><p>The sword beams fell like lightning and thunder, frantically crashing into the three Saint Sovereign Saint Beasts.</p><p></p><p>"Ahhhhh!"</p><p></p><p>Accompanied by agonized screams and violent explosions, the three Saint Beasts were instantly killed by Ye Xiao.</p><p></p><p>"So strong!"</p><p></p><p>Lu Qingshan's pupils constricted again. Although it was just a sword intent clone, its sword intent couldn't help but tremble slightly.</p><p></p><p>Ye Xiao had actually detected the movement of the three Saint Sovereign Saint Beasts below even before him, and in the instant they tried to flee, he launched the attack, directly annihilating them.</p><p></p><p>Lu Qingshan asked himself, even his true body could achieve this, but the problem was, his true body's cultivation had already reached the peak of the Celestial Sovereign realm!</p><p></p><p>Yet Ye Xiao?</p><p></p><p>He had not even reached the Celestial Sovereign realm, and yet he could be this powerful.</p><p></p><p>This child is truly heaven-defying.</p><p></p><p>Too strong.</p><p></p><p>His future accomplishments will definitely not be inferior to his own, no, he may even surpass that one. At this moment, Lu Qingshan's body was trembling slightly in excitement.</p><p></p><p>The Nine Provinces have actually produced such a powerful genius!</p><p></p><p>So thrilling! He took a deep breath, and before his sword intent disappeared, he forcefully asked:</p><p></p><p>"Sir, your impressive skills, may I ask your name and where you learned your cultivation?"</p><p></p><p>Of course, Ye Xiao would not reveal his true identity. He thought for a moment about the few sentences he could remember, and then replied calmly:</p><p></p><p>"Solitary shadow in the cold river, an old friend of the jianghu, why bother with introductions when we meet?"</p><p></p><p>With that, he stored the three Saint Sovereign Saint Beasts in his storage ring and turned to leave.</p><p></p><p>Lu Qingshan couldn't help but praise, "Excellent literary flair."</p><p></p><p>However, he soon frowned. "But...why did he say 'solitary shadow in the cold river'? There's only a mountain here."</p><p></p><p>Here is the full English translation of the Chinese excerpt:</p><p></p><p>Ah! Could it be that the place he lives has water? That's why he habitually mentioned the words "cold river"?</p><p></p><p>It seems that after going back, I need to check if there is any place near the river that has this kind of sword dao genius.</p><p></p><p>Ye Xiao didn't expect that his casual quoting of a sentence could make Lu Qingshan associate so much.</p><p></p><p>If he had known, he absolutely would not have said that.</p><p></p><p>However, at the moment, he was still very happy, having caught three more Deity Ancestor-level spirit beasts. After going back, he would revive them and raise them, so that he could have a steady supply of Deity Ancestor-level spirit beast meals every day.</p><p></p><p>What surprised him even more was that in other places, he had also found the remains of another Deity Ancestor-level spirit beast.</p><p></p><p>The most exciting thing for Ye Xiao was that in this set of remains, there was still a trace of the other party's spiritual power.</p><p></p><p>This meant that he could revive the other party, and together with Noel Fei's split body and Ji Feng, he would have a total of six Deity Ancestor-level spirit beasts.</p><p></p><p>Roughly one per day, every seven days. </p><p></p><p>How wonderful!</p><p></p><p>Extremely wonderful! Next, he would go to Hu City to take a look at that forging competition, to see if he could obtain a spatial purple crystal.</p><p></p><p>Time passed quickly, and in the blink of an eye, it was three days later.</p><p></p><p>Hu City, as one of the three top-tier major cities with the most prosperous martial arts culture in the Nine Provinces, would be hosting a nationwide forging competition in the Nine Provinces today.</p><p></p><p>Forging is not unique to the Nine Provinces, but it was invented there.</p><p></p><p>It is said that since the ancient times, the Sage Emperor Fuxi had begun to teach people the art of forging.</p><p></p><p>After a development process of five thousand years, countless forging masters have contributed their efforts, further promoting and developing the forging skills of the Nine Provinces.</p><p></p><p>Now, it has also become one of the symbols of the brilliant martial arts civilization of the Nine Provinces.</p><p></p><p>It is often exported as the martial arts culture of the Nine Provinces to other states.</p><p></p><p>There are also some international forging competitions called the World Competition, while the one in the Nine Provinces is called the Nine Provinces Competition.</p><p></p><p>Although the scale of participants in the World Competition, in terms of both the number of people and the participating regions, is far greater than the Nine Provinces Competition.</p><p></p><p>However, some people who have won the World Competition championship may not necessarily be able to win the championship of the Nine Provinces Competition.</p><p></p><p>There was once a forging master from the Nine Provinces who had won the world championship at the Nine Provinces level multiple times. When interviewed by reporters and asked what other goals he had, his answer was - I want to win the forging championship of the Nine Provinces Competition.</p><p></p><p>This shows the tremendous scale and high standards of the Nine Provinces Competition.</p><p></p><p>Because of the Nine Provinces Forging Competition, the entire Hu City has become particularly lively.</p><p></p><p>Hu City was already very lively on normal days, but now with the influx of participants and spectators, it has become even more crowded.</p><p></p><p>It is said that even the most ordinary roadside inns have rents that are three to four times higher than normal.</p><p></p><p>Fortunately, the vast majority of people in this world are martial artists.</p><p></p><p>The endurance of martial artists far exceeds that of people from the previous world.</p><p></p><p>Many people just lay out their bedding directly in the parks.</p><p></p><p>When Ye Xiao and Huan Liuli arrived, they were also greatly shocked by the bustling scene in Hu City.</p><p></p><p>"Wow, so many people!" Huan Liuli couldn't help but exclaim.</p><p></p><p>Ye Xiao was a little better, but he was also greatly shocked.</p><p></p><p>After all, the population of this world is much larger than the previous one.</p><p></p><p>So this is much stronger than the previous world's capital city.</p><p></p><p>Huan Liuli smacked her lips and couldn't help but murmur, "This place is much more fun than Jiang Hai City. I wish I had come here earlier."</p><p></p><p>"You'd better save it," Ye Xiao retorted.</p><p></p><p>"This place not only has a larger population than Jiang Hai City, but it has also gathered a large number of martial arts elites from the Nine Provinces. If you had come here earlier, you might have been 'digested' and thrown into the river of Hu City long ago."</p><p></p><p>"Oh."</p><p></p><p>Huan Liuli felt that it was indeed the case.</p><p></p><p>But speaking of which, if she had come to Hu City, she wouldn't have met such a powerful master as Ye Xiao.</p><p></p><p>It seems that she is still quite fortunate.</p><p></p><p>Okay, it's decided. I'll be Ye Xiao's servant for another hundred years, to make it a nice round number of a thousand years!</p><p></p><p>After a thousand years, when my cultivation is complete, I'll still have to overthrow him and become the master!</p><p></p><p>Ye Xiao quickly arrived at the Nine Provinces Competition venue in Hu City.</p><p></p><p>There was a preliminary selection site here.</p><p></p><p>By just showing a bit of his skills, he could enter and participate in the forging competition.</p><p></p><p>The level of the test was also very simple. It was to refine a thousand-jin of pig iron into an iron sword, and the grade had to reach at least the sub-Transcendent level.</p><p></p><p>Because there were too many participants who wanted to compete.</p><p></p><p>If one could make a name for themselves in this competition, it would be easy to enter a well-known forging company in the Nine Provinces.</p><p></p><p>For state-owned enterprises, there might be a second round of assessment, but for some large private forging companies, they could even directly waive the assessment based on the competition results and school performance, and directly negotiate the salary level before taking up the position.</p><p></p><p>For Ye Xiao, this was simply too easy.</p><p></p><p>He had practiced this before, and now with his Godly Craftsmanship, he could even refine it into a Master-level flying dagger.</p>

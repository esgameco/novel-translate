        <h1>Chapter 127</h1>
        <div class="content">
            <p>Here is the full English translation of the Chinese excerpt:</p><p></p><p>Ye Xiao spoke in a calm tone, and two massive sword beams came crashing down from the canyon above, instantly slaying over ten thousand star beasts.</p><p></p><p>At the same time, the massive explosive impact force also caused the other star beasts to be shaken, their internal organs dislocated, their bodies flung back, either colliding with each other or crashing into the stone walls.</p><p></p><p>Thousands of star beasts were killed or stunned on the spot.</p><p></p><p>Seeing this, the Saint Envoy shuddered, and his entire body's hair stood on end.</p><p></p><p>Staring at Ye Xiao's gaze fixed on him, he knew that this time, he could not escape.</p><p></p><p>After taking a deep breath, he resigned himself to his fate.</p><p></p><p>"I never expected that such a powerful human genius would emerge from this small Jianghai City. I admit defeat."</p><p></p><p>This was not because he was a coward.</p><p></p><p>Although even ants can fight desperately for survival, if one knows their fate is sealed, any further resistance would be futile.</p><p></p><p>Ye Xiao did not speak.</p><p></p><p>To him, the opponent was just a star beast, even if it could now take on a human form, its essence was still that of an animal.</p><p></p><p>Killing him would suffice.</p><p></p><p>However, before killing him, he needed to search the opponent's memories to see what the star beast clan was up to. He did not believe that the star beast clan went to such lengths merely to eat humans or occupy human cities - that would be too idiotic.</p><p></p><p>But before he could make a move, the opponent spoke again.</p><p></p><p>"However, today, although I am destined to die by your hand, I will also trap you here for a while. </p><p></p><p>Without your powerful protection, the human race will find it difficult to resist the star beasts enhanced by the Seven-Star Cluster. </p><p></p><p>A few hours will be enough for hundreds of thousands in several cities to perish."</p><p></p><p>As he spoke, the opponent began to form hand seals.</p><p></p><p>Unfortunately, although his movements were fast, Ye Xiao's speed was even faster.</p><p></p><p>Pu-chi! With a slight movement of his eyes, two beams of light flashed, directly severing the opponent's arms.</p><p></p><p>"So fast!" the Saint Envoy of the star beasts exclaimed in shock, but then he smiled.</p><p></p><p>"But it's useless. The star beasts' cultivation is different from humans - we can directly use our bloodline to unleash our techniques, without the need for hand seals and cultivation paths like humans.</p><p></p><p>Although I made the hand seals just now, the formation had already activated the moment I had the intent to act."</p><p></p><p>True enough, a black and white alternating formation suddenly appeared, enveloping Ye Xiao within it.</p><p></p><p>As the formation emerged, the Saint Envoy of the star beasts roared:</p><p></p><p>"All star beasts, detonate yourselves and infuse your lifeblood and star pearls into the formation!"</p><p></p><p>As soon as he spoke, countless star beasts, without the slightest hesitation, began to self-destruct.</p><p></p><p>The unity of the star beasts was fully displayed at this moment.</p><p></p><p>Their blood and star pearls all seeped into the formation, nourishing and empowering it.</p><p></p><p>Although the individual star beasts were not strong, their numerical advantage in accumulating power made the formation extremely terrifying.</p><p></p><p>"An Imperial Formation!" Ye Xiao exclaimed with a hint of surprise.</p><p></p><p>Having just cultivated the Heavenly Transformation Formation, he could instantly recognize the level of this formation.</p><p></p><p>The Saint Envoy of the star beasts smiled slightly, a hint of pride surfacing in his eyes.</p><p></p><p>"Not bad, you have a good eye to recognize this as an Imperial Formation at a glance.</p><p></p><p>This is the Earthly Calamity Heavenly Pressure Formation! It is an innate Imperial Formation in the bloodline of our Black Mysterious Tortoise Clan!</p><p></p><p>It possesses extremely powerful defensive capabilities. Whether from the outside or the inside, it cannot be easily broken.</p><p></p><p>Outwardly, it is an Imperial-grade defensive formation.</p><p>Inwardly, it is an Imperial-grade imprisonment formation.</p><p></p><p>Even if your strength is extraordinary, it will be difficult for you to break through this formation anytime soon."</p><p></p><p>As he said this, he expected Ye Xiao to be shocked and grave, but to his surprise, Ye Xiao seemed excited instead.</p><p></p><p>"This Imperial Formation has defensive properties?"</p><p></p><p>The Saint Envoy of the star beasts furrowed his brows, somewhat puzzled.</p><p></p><p>Is this person insane?</p><p></p><p>Doesn't he know that this is an Imperial Formation, which even Sage Realm cultivators would be trapped within?</p><p></p><p>Trapping him for a few hours would be enough for massive casualties on the human side.</p><p></p><p>What he didn't know was that Ye Xiao was not worried about that at all, because he had the Supremely Mysterious Heavenly Pressure, which could analyze the opponent's spiritual power and learn the formation, allowing him to easily break it.</p><p></p><p>Moreover, by doing so, he could also learn another powerful Imperial Formation, the Earthly Calamity Heavenly Pressure Formation.</p><p></p><p>The Heavenly Transformation Formation was mainly focused on killing and illusion effects. This would nicely complement its lack in defensive formations.</p><p></p><p>This was an unexpected windfall, how could Ye Xiao not be delighted?</p><p></p><p>He had already planned to search the opponent's memories, and now, for the sake of this formation, he had even more reason to do so.</p><p></p><p>Without further ado, the Supremely Mysterious Heavenly Pressure was activated, the overwhelming spiritual power ruthlessly and unstoppably invading the opponent's mind.</p><p></p><p>"This Imperial Formation is now mine."</p><p></p><p>The Saint Envoy of the star beasts' pupils suddenly shrank, his entire being overwhelmed.</p><p></p><p>Here is the full English translation of the Chinese excerpt:</p><p></p><p>Everyone is Dumbfounded!</p><p></p><p>"You're searching my memories? You've actually cultivated a spiritual technique? Noâ€”!"</p><p></p><p>What a joke? A supreme expert, someone who has cultivated the sword way and blade techniques to the pinnacle, actually cultivated spiritual power? And to such an outstanding degree?</p><p></p><p>This human, is he even human anymore? This person is simply a demonic monster!</p><p></p><p>"Damn it!"</p><p></p><p>Without the slightest hesitation, the Saint Envoy of the Star Beasts immediately wanted to detonate its own body and soul. </p><p></p><p>It could no longer delay.</p><p></p><p>This human was too strong, strong enough to make the Star Beasts feel appalled.</p><p></p><p>If it didn't self-destruct, he would inevitably obtain its memories.</p><p></p><p>Whether it was the Heavenly Dipper Formation or its own memories regarding the Star Beasts' strategic deployments, they absolutely could not fall into his hands.</p><p></p><p>He even suspected that Ye Xiao wanted to obtain the Heavenly Dipper Formation just to leave it for him to cultivate.</p><p></p><p>Absolutely not!</p><p></p><p>The demonic nature of this human was far beyond his imagination. If he were to also learn the Heavenly Dipper Formation, in the future the Star Beast Clan would be even harder to deal with.</p><p></p><p>But just as he was about to reveal this thought, he suddenly found that his body couldn't move at all!</p><p></p><p>Saint Envoy of the Star Beasts: "???"</p><p></p><p>The bound Illusion Jade Dew burst into loud laughter.</p><p></p><p>"Idiot! My master is unrivaled in the world, in front of him, you still want to self-destruct? What are you thinking?</p><p></p><p>Your soul has already been suppressed by his spiritual power."</p><p></p><p>The Saint Envoy of the Star Beasts was completely plunged into despair.</p><p></p><p>This freak! How the hell can I fight this? Can't live, can't die!</p><p></p><p>Ye Xiao, regardless of whether it was shocked or not, directly forced a scan of its memories.</p><p></p><p>The opponent was only at the innate fifth rank, while he was at the innate sixth rank. Within the same realm, he was invincible, and even if the opponent was one rank lower, he would still be able to crush them.</p><p></p><p>First, the Heavenly Dipper Formation, the terrifying nature of this formation, Ye Xiao had already sensed. With the absorption of the massive Star Beast spiritual blood and star cores, it could indeed withstand his attacks.</p><p></p><p>Such a good imperial formation, he would just seize it first and figure it out later.</p><p></p><p>A sweep of spiritual power, like reading a book, directly recorded it into his divine soul and began cultivating.</p><p></p><p>Then he looked at the Star Beasts' schemes.</p><p></p><p>As the spiritual power delved deeper, a hidden history also gradually unfolded before Ye Xiao.</p><p></p><p>More than fifty years ago, the Star Beast Clan launched a tactical plan codenamed "the Vanguard".</p><p></p><p>The learning ability of the human race far surpassed the Star Beasts, and their growth rate was also far beyond the Star Beasts.</p><p></p><p>The normal growth cycle of an ordinary Star Beast was over a hundred, or even several hundred years, and the limit of an ordinary Star Beast was at most the innate first rank.</p><p></p><p>For a high-ranking Star Beast, such as a dragon-level bloodline Star Beast, to reach the Divine Ancestor realm, it would take over a thousand years.</p><p></p><p>But humans, in an average of just sixty to seventy years, could reach the Divine Ancestor realm!</p><p></p><p>It's easy to imagine how difficult it is for the Star Beasts to control humans.</p><p></p><p>However, the reproductive speed of the Star Beasts is far superior to that of humans.</p><p></p><p>Relying on this advantage, the Star Beast Clan launched the Vanguard plan.</p><p></p><p>The so-called Vanguard plan was to conquer humans in two stages.</p><p></p><p>The first stage was to secretly place some Star Beasts on this planet.</p><p></p><p>For example, the beast disaster fifty years ago, the Star Beasts had arranged for many of their clansmen to hide on Earth, waiting for this Seven-Star Convergence, to deal a heavy blow to the human race.</p><p></p><p>Because soon after the Seven-Star Convergence, there would be a beast disaster! That was the second stage arranged by the Star Beast Clan.</p><p></p><p>It was the true final assault on the human race! When the human race had experienced the Seven-Star Convergence, their overall strength would suffer a certain degree of impact. At this time, the Star Beasts would launch a large-scale attack, which would be much stronger than a single beast disaster.</p><p></p><p>Moreover, according to the memories Ye Xiao searched, this beast disaster might be much stronger than the previous ones.</p><p></p><p>So at this moment, not only Jianghai City and the surrounding few cities, but all cities around the world were experiencing the changes brought about by the Seven-Star Convergence.</p><p></p><p>In addition, there was an extremely serious matter regarding the Nine States.</p><p></p><p>Because the Nine States had the longest history of anti-Star Beast civilization, the most techniques, the richest resources, and the strongest strength, two hundred years ago, the inferior forces of the other states, unable to withstand the beast disasters, deliberately guided the Star Beasts towards the Nine States.</p><p></p><p>Therefore, the Nine States have suffered much greater shocks from the recent beast disasters than the other states.</p><p></p><p>Every time, the number of martial artists sacrificed by the Nine States made Ye Xiao's heart feel as if it had been tightly grasped by someone.</p><p></p><p>This is also why the talents in their twenties in the capital were easily swept away by Pu Jiansheng.</p><p></p><p>Because the Nine States had sacrificed too many powerful martial artists, many precious inheritances had lost their lineage, and those young geniuses could only try to slowly explore their family's sword techniques on their own.</p><p></p><p>But Pu Jiansheng was personally guided by a Divine Ancestor, the gap between them was naturally incomparable.</p><p></p><p>In order to make up for the losses of the Nine States, the high-level officials of the Nine States Alliance had also formulated an extremely secret plan.</p><p></p><p>(This chapter ends)</p>

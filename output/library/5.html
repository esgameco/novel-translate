        <h1>Chapter 5</h1>
        <div class="content">
            <p>Here is the full English translation of the Chinese excerpt:</p><p></p><p>And so, he would not be discovered.</p><p></p><p>Just after Ye Xiao had passed by, several figures quickly flashed in from different directions.</p><p></p><p>An old woman, a middle-aged man, and an elderly man carrying a young woman in traditional Chinese dress.</p><p></p><p>When the four of them arrived at the riverside, their pupils all constricted involuntarily.</p><p></p><p>"Such a powerful sword technique!"</p><p></p><p>At this moment, even though the river had resumed its flow, the onlookers could still clearly see the terrifying nature of that single stroke.</p><p></p><p>Because it had extended for nearly a kilometer!</p><p></p><p>Aside from the over 200 meters covered by the river, the rest of the hundreds of meters of sword marks were all imprinted on the ground.</p><p></p><p>At this time, a faint white glow was just rising on the eastern horizon, and this massive gully filled with water looked like a gaping bloody maw on the dark ground, exuding an eerie and unsettling aura.</p><p></p><p>"Old Qin, who did this?" the old woman asked first. The elderly man carrying the young woman shook his head with a wry smile.</p><p></p><p>"I don't know either. I was taking Yuanyan to the academy's training grounds for morning practice when I heard the commotion and hurried over. Come to think of it, you two arrived even faster than I did."</p><p></p><p>The old woman then looked at the middle-aged man, who also shook his head slightly.</p><p></p><p>"I don't know either. But one thing is certain - the person is very strong, even stronger than the three of us.</p><p></p><p>I don't know the extent of their cultivation, but judging from the lingering sword intent in the air and this single stroke on the ground, I can feel that with my innate second-grade cultivation, I would be no match for them.</p><p></p><p>However, I'm about to break through to the third grade, so I wonder if I'll be able to contend with them then?"</p><p></p><p>The old woman couldn't help but sigh:</p><p></p><p>"I never imagined that Jianghai City would produce such a powerful sword master. It's just a pity that we don't know who he is."</p><p></p><p>"Regardless of who he is, until his identity is confirmed, we must all be on our guard.</p><p></p><p>If such a formidable master wishes to do harm to Jianghai City, the consequences would be unimaginable."</p><p></p><p>At these words, the expressions of the old man and old woman grew grave.</p><p></p><p>The silent young woman, meanwhile, had her heart pounding furiously.</p><p></p><p>Because she knew the terrifying power of the one behind that sword stroke.</p><p></p><p>The three people in front of her, who were wary of him, were all peak master experts of Jianghai City! The renowned genius of Jianghai City, Nangong Ling! The acclaimed top female expert of Jianghai City, Ouyang Zhongyu, the librarian. And her own grandfather, Qin Shenglong, the number one martial artist of Jianghai City!</p><p></p><p>They represented the pinnacle of Jianghai City's martial arts, yet they were all wary of this single individual.</p><p></p><p>Just who was he?...</p><p></p><p>At this time, Ye Xiao had already returned to the library.</p><p></p><p>Along the way, he had drawn several conclusions.</p><p></p><p>The main one was about that last sword stroke.</p><p></p><p>First, he had been too reckless - not knowing the true power of his sword technique, he had acted rashly and drawn the attention of many. Fortunately, he had managed to withdraw in time, avoiding being discovered.</p><p></p><p>The few auras he had sensed did not seem weak at all.</p><p></p><p>And this was just a small Jianghai City - how many powerful experts could there be in the Central Plains? And in the Nine Provinces? Looking at the world at large?</p><p></p><p>After all, among the thousands of graduates from Jianghai City each year, there was the potential for several masters to emerge over the decades!</p><p></p><p>So in the future, he would have to be more low-key. </p><p></p><p>He had decided to safely cultivate within the library, never exposing his true abilities.</p><p></p><p>Secondly, the power of that sword technique was not a reflection of his own cultivation, but rather the high grade of the soul-merging cultivation method.</p><p></p><p>In this world, cultivation methods were classified as basic, transcendent, and master-level.</p><p></p><p>Depending on the grade of the cultivation method, the displayed power would differ greatly...</p><p></p><p>Here is the full English translation of the Chinese excerpt:</p><p></p><p>The amplification of attack power also varies.</p><p></p><p>However, according to Ye Xiao's understanding, even the grandmaster-level cultivation techniques can only provide a 100% amplification, which is just a doubling. But the strike he just performed seemed to have an amplification greater than just double. So Ye Xiao was not too clear about what level his blade technique was, and his spiritual soul had not shown its level either. <div class="contentadv"><script>loadAdv(7,3);</script></div>But then again, he didn't even know what level his own spiritual soul was, his cultivation has been quite muddled.</p><p></p><p>He should find an opportunity to clarify these things in the future.</p><p></p><p>The third point, and also the most important one, is the consumption of the cultivation technique! The consumption of the technique he just used was not low, it drained 20% of the spiritual energy in his body.</p><p></p><p>Doesn't this mean that if he were to unleash dozens of such strikes, his spiritual energy would be completely depleted? Although his cultivation method can absorb and replenish spiritual energy, with only two basic cultivation methods, the recovery speed is too slow.</p><p></p><p>It seems that the next step should be to focus on cultivating his cultivation methods, in order to solve the problem of his endurance.</p><p></p><p>A man cannot be a quick-handed swordsman! Thinking this through, Ye Xiao then entered the library, planning to have some steamed buns and a bowl of soy milk.</p><p></p><p>The advancement of his cultivation has allowed him to go for days without needing rest, and he can also sustain himself for a short period without eating, relying on his spiritual energy.</p><p></p><p>However, as a foodie, he still has his own bottom line.</p><p></p><p>Sleep can be skipped!</p><p>But food must be eaten!</p><p></p><p>However, just as he stepped into the library, his phone suddenly rang.</p><p></p><p>Ye Xiao took out his phone and glanced at the screen, which showed the Jiangcheng Defense Corps.</p><p></p><p>This is the force responsible for maintaining the city's stability, but he hasn't done anything wrong, so why would they be calling him so early in the morning?</p><p></p><p>It must be a scam, right?</p><p></p><p>Ye Xiao decisively hung up the phone, after all, he still had 12,000 in his bank account, half a year's worth of savings.</p><p></p><p>But just as he hung up, the other party called again.</p><p></p><p>Ye Xiao raised his eyebrows slightly and had to answer the call. A deep male voice soon came from the other end of the line.</p><p></p><p>"We have your son, please..."</p><p></p><p>Ye Xiao gave a cold smile, it's indeed a scam. Without letting the other party finish, he directly responded:</p><p></p><p>"I have no money, I'm poor."</p><p></p><p>"No, your son is in our hands."</p><p></p><p>"Then bury him."</p><p></p><p>With that, Ye Xiao directly hung up the phone.</p><p></p><p>But the other party seemed quite persistent, even after he hung up, they called again.</p><p></p><p>"What's wrong with you? Your son is in our hands, why are you talking about money?"</p><p></p><p>"Weren't you calling to ask me for money?"</p><p></p><p>"Who said anything about money? Your son got into trouble and was caught by us, you'd better come get him quickly."</p><p></p><p>"I don't have a son."</p><p></p><p>"Isn't Gu Hai your son?"</p><p></p><p>Ye Xiao: "..."</p><p></p><p>He was silent for two seconds, then the other party's voice came again.</p><p></p><p>"Last night, our defense corps conducted a sweep and found your son Gu Hai at the Red Romance, having improper dealings with an employee there. Please come and pick him up."</p><p></p><p>Ye Xiao: "..."</p><p></p><p>He fell silent again for two seconds, then responded:</p><p></p><p>"Understood."</p><p></p><p>With that, he hung up the phone, his expression full of speechlessness.</p><p></p><p>He had thought it was someone trying to scam him!</p><p></p><p>Turns out it was real, someone was actually looking for him.</p><p></p><p>What he didn't expect even more was that it was actually Gu Hai who got caught at the Red Romance, and they were saying he was his father.</p><p></p><p>Life is full of surprises, and now he unexpectedly has a son who is even older than himself.</p><p></p><p>(End of this chapter)</p>

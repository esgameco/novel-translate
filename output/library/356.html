        <h1>Chapter 356</h1>
        <div class="content">
            <p>Here is the full English translation of the Chinese excerpt:</p><p></p><p>Finally, he had broken through to the legendary realm of the divine realm experts.</p><p></p><p>This power was too strong!</p><p></p><p>After reaching the divine realm, his cultivation, the power of his techniques, his defensive abilities, and his perception were all elevated to an unprecedented level.</p><p></p><p>If one had not personally reached this level of cultivation, it would be impossible to truly comprehend how terrifying it is.</p><p></p><p>The benefits of breaking through to the divine realm are far more than just this.</p><p></p><p>If one were to list all the other benefits, it would likely require more than ten pages of A4 paper to fully describe them.</p><p></p><p>Additionally, only by reaching the divine realm and elevating one's body to the divine physique level can one fully unleash the power of divine techniques.</p><p></p><p>The reason divine techniques are called "divine" is that they have a specific requirement - they need to be channeled through an extremely powerful conduit to reach their full potential.</p><p></p><p>It's like a water pipe - the pressure it can withstand and the amount of water it can carry differ vastly depending on its capacity.</p><p></p><p>Ye Xiao really wanted to test the extent of his current strength, but he knew he could not do so at the moment.</p><p></p><p>Due to his heightened perception, he had sensed a powerful energy nearby, and it was from the Xuanyuan Clan.</p><p></p><p>It's best not to stir up too much commotion and draw unwanted attention. As his ancestors had advised, he should maintain a low profile until his strength has grown significantly.</p><p></p><p>His divine soul and eyes were priceless treasures that could easily attract the envy and covetousness of others.</p><p></p><p>Activating the Yin-Yang Evasion Technique, Ye Xiao vanished from the spot in an instant.</p><p></p><p>Meanwhile, Ning Zhiyuan, who was not far away, had noticed the lightning tribulation had completely ceased, indicating the other party had successfully weathered the tribulation. He immediately left the spirit energy ship and flew over, eager to see who the person was.</p><p></p><p>However, when he arrived, Ye Xiao had already disappeared without a trace. The other people quickly caught up as well, and they all exclaimed in surprise, "Young Master, where did that person go?"</p><p></p><p>Ning Zhiyuan shook his head. "I don't know. He must have sensed our presence and left ahead of us."</p><p></p><p>"What a pity, we couldn't find him."</p><p></p><p>Ning Zhiyuan then called out to the space behind him, "Elder Ning, please come out."</p><p></p><p>The air distorted, and an elderly man in a gray robe slowly appeared beside Ning Zhiyuan. This was a powerful expert from the Ning Clan, responsible for secretly guarding Ning Zhiyuan's growth.</p><p></p><p>Ning Zhiyuan inquired, "Elder Ning, you should have also seen that person just now, right?"</p><p></p><p>"Young Master, I didn't get a clear look. I only caught a glimpse of him from the back, and he seemed quite young, likely no more than thirty years old. But I couldn't see his face clearly. And during the lightning tribulation, even my divine techniques were rendered ineffective, so I couldn't investigate further."</p><p></p><p>"Then why didn't you stop him when he left?"</p><p></p><p>"Young Master, his movement techniques were already at the level of transcending realms. If I'm not mistaken, he was using the Nine-Star Divine Technique!"</p><p></p><p>Ning Zhiyuan's pupils constricted. The Ning Clan, as a direct branch of the Xuanyuan Clan, did possess divine techniques, but the Nine-Star Divine Technique was one of only two such techniques in existence.</p><p></p><p>The fact that this young man could casually use such a powerful divine technique was truly astonishing and beyond Ning Zhiyuan's comprehension.</p><p></p><p>Elder Ning continued, "Although he has just broken through to the divine realm, it would not be easy for me to chase after him. If I were to pursue him and something were to happen to you, Young Master, I would be gravely responsible. Moreover, given his current strength and potential, if he were to misunderstand us and have twenty years to grow, he could even destroy the Ning Clan. Do you think I would still be able to catch him then?"</p><p></p><p>Ning Zhiyuan shuddered. He realized this person was truly formidable, far beyond his own understanding. Elder Ning was rarely this impressed by anyone, yet he spoke of this young man with such reverence.</p><p></p><p>Who was this person, and where did he come from? Ning Zhiyuan had never heard of a "Ye Xiao" among the top talents of the Xuanyuan Clan.</p><p></p><p>Here is the full English translation of the Chinese excerpt:</p><p></p><p>Apart from that, there is one more thing.</p><p></p><p>Which of those people is not from the core families of the Xuanyuan clan - the young masters and young mistresses? How could they possibly appear in such a remote place?</p><p></p><p>But if it's not them, then who could the other party be? When did such a prodigy emerge from within the Xuanyuan clan?</p><p></p><p>"Young master, I feel that the most pressing matter right now is to focus on the Star Tomb of the Nine Realms. The experts from the Thunder God Tribe, the Giant Ape Tribe, and the Wing God Tribe - if they arrive there first, it will deal a huge, even devastating, blow to the influence of our Xuanyuan God Tribe."</p><p></p><p>Ning Zhiyuan nodded, glancing around, unable to help but let out a long, weary sigh, his eyes full of regret.</p><p></p><p>"Let's go. We must go support them first."</p><p></p><p>An hour later, in the starry sky above the Nine Realms, a fierce battle was raging.</p><p></p><p>The powerhouses of the Xuanyuan God Tribe were fighting against the powerhouses of the other three tribes. </p><p></p><p>The two sides were attacking each other ruthlessly, going all out.</p><p></p><p>But even though the Giant Ape Tribe, the Wing God Tribe, and the Thunder God Tribe had a numerical advantage, they were still being suppressed by the Xuanyuan God Tribe.</p><p></p><p>There was no way around it - the three god tribes were all ranked outside the top hundred in the starry sky race rankings.</p><p></p><p>Only the strongest, the Thunder God Tribe, had just barely reached the 99th rank. They had no way of matching the Xuanyuan God Tribe.</p><p></p><p>The higher the race ranking in the starry sky, the stronger the power it represented.</p><p></p><p>Similarly, their martial dao foundations would also be stronger than other races.</p><p></p><p>They had more, stronger, and more complete cultivation methods, more abundant resources, and the warriors they cultivated would have richer advantages in battles at the same level.</p><p></p><p>"Thunder Roar! These god tombs were clearly discovered by us first. You Xuanyuan God Tribe, do you have no shame? Since you're so shameless as to compete with us!"</p><p></p><p>Thunder Roar was a powerful expert at the Emperor Realm 64 Dragons from the Xuanyuan God Tribe, the strongest on the entire battlefield.</p><p></p><p>He snorted disdainfully, "Don't cherry-pick your words. You may have found some god tombs, but we haven't touched a single one of them. Everything the Xuanyuan God Tribe has moved on is what we discovered ourselves. What does that have to do with you?"</p><p></p><p>"You...you shameless! It's precisely because we discovered the god tombs that we were able to confirm this starry domain has god tombs, and the entire area has been marked by us. You're blatantly stealing from us!"</p><p></p><p>"Enough with the talk? If you want to fight, then fight. If not, then scram! This starry domain was first discovered by the ancestors of our Xuanyuan God Tribe. I can also say this entire domain is the territory of the Xuanyuan God Tribe. Shouldn't you be the ones to get out of our territory?"</p><p></p><p>"You...!"</p><p></p><p>Mai Kang was so angry he coughed up blood, but he was helpless.</p><p></p><p>Survival of the fittest, when the other side's fist was bigger.</p><p></p><p>The three tribes combined were no match for the Xuanyuan God Tribe.</p><p></p><p>But just then, a large group of powerful auras, each no weaker than the Emperor Realm, suddenly appeared in the starry sky above.</p><p></p><p>"You Xuanyuan God Tribe have become far too arrogant. Bullying and oppressing other god tribes just because your fist is stronger, don't you find it shameful?"</p><p></p><p>Mai Kang and the others immediately beamed with joy.</p><p></p><p>"Great, it's our people. Our reinforcements have arrived. Hahaha!"</p><p></p><p>Thunder Roar's expression suddenly changed. As the saying goes, a dragon playing in shallow waters is teased by shrimp, and a tiger descending to the plains is bullied by dogs.</p><p></p><p>With the arrival of their reinforcements, they would absolutely not let the Xuanyuan God Tribe off easily.</p><p></p><p>There was bound to be a fierce battle ahead!</p><p></p><p>But just as he was feeling anxious, the next moment, an even more powerful group of auras appeared above their heads, also at the Emperor Realm.</p><p></p><p>"Who dares to say the Xuanyuan God Tribe is shameless? To dare curse our Xuanyuan God Tribe, you're really courting death."</p><p></p><p>Thunder Roar's face lit up with joy.</p><p></p><p>"Great, it's the reinforcements from the Xuanyuan God Tribe."</p><p></p><p>The three god tribes on the other side immediately changed expressions, the smiles that had just appeared on their faces vanishing without a trace.</p><p></p><p>At this moment, a refined and cultured-looking man slowly walked out from the spiritual energy ship of the Wing God Tribe, cupping his hands towards them.</p><p></p><p>"Who would have thought it was Young Master Ning. My apologies, it was all a misunderstanding just now. I am Kartomeil, the manager of the Wing God Tribe."</p><p></p><p>The moment he finished speaking, a massive spiritual energy cannon was fired directly from Ning's spiritual energy ship.</p><p></p><p>This huge spiritual energy cannon was far more powerful than the attack of the star beasts on the human race earlier! Boom! Accompanied by a violent explosion, the spiritual energy ship behind Kartomeil was instantly reduced to powder.</p><p></p><p>Kartomeil's expression changed drastically.</p><p></p><p>"Young Master Ning, what is the meaning of this?"</p><p></p><p>Ning Zhiyuan gave him a cold glance and said, "You just insulted our Xuanyuan God Tribe as shameless. I didn't fire that cannon at you, which is already a kindness.</p><p></p><p>This starry domain now belongs to our Xuanyuan God Tribe!</p><p></p><p>Take your people and get out!"</p>

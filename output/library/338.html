        <h1>Chapter 338</h1>
        <div class="content">
            <p>Here is the full English translation of the Chinese excerpt:</p><p></p><p>"I have never seen his true face, I only know that he often wears a black robe and has a jade ring on his hand. No one knows who his true identity is."</p><p></p><p>Ye Xiao fell silent for a moment, then raised his hand and struck with a sword.</p><p></p><p>Lin Qingbei's head flew up, and the body that he had previously maintained with spiritual energy was also split in two by Ye Xiao and fell to the ground in two halves.</p><p></p><p>Ye Xiao waved his hand, and his star core, as well as the divine blood extracted from the other human tribes, totaling hundreds of billions of people, all fell into Ye Xiao's hands.</p><p></p><p>He glanced at the falling corpses of the star beasts in the sky above, then turned and returned to the ground.</p><p></p><p>It was time to be quiet for a while.</p><p></p><p>Around 3 o'clock in the afternoon, the Wing God Tribe and Thunder God Tribe in the west, as well as the Giant Ape God Tribe in the south, had all fallen to each other's positions and began to summon their descendants.</p><p></p><p>By 3:30, the Nine States also welcomed a terrifying momentum.</p><p></p><p>Except for a few Monarch Realm experts, the rest were mostly Emperor Realm powerhouses! Nearly a hundred of them! According to the previous plan, the temporary high-level officials led by the Emperor were responsible for reporting to the descending Xuanyuan God Tribe and handing over the authority of the Nine States.</p><p></p><p>Ye Xiao was also happy to be idle and focus on improving his own strength at home.</p><p></p><p>He first extracted Lin Qingbei's cultivation technique from his star core. Lin Qingbei's cultivation technique was a divine art, and it was fundamentally different from the Great Accomplishment Divine Body, which was an excellent divine art.</p><p></p><p>This was something Ye Xiao had felt during the battle.</p><p></p><p>The Longevity Cloud Robe Technique! This was the name of Lin Qingbei's cultivation technique.</p><p></p><p>After refining it onto the Golden Book, the Golden Book began to cultivate it, and it would probably reach the Great Perfection realm in a few days.</p><p></p><p>Next was the refinement of Lin Qingbei's divine blood.</p><p></p><p>Ye Xiao originally wanted to blend Lin Qingbei's star core and refine a super-powerful pill.</p><p></p><p>But then he thought better of it.</p><p></p><p>The energy contained in Lin Qingbei's star core was extremely vast, and it would probably take a lot of time to refine it successfully.</p><p></p><p>Because Ye Xiao still did not have divine-level alchemy.</p><p></p><p>He wanted to wait until he had synthesized divine-level alchemy, and then refine Lin Qingbei's star core.</p><p></p><p>In fact, in addition to Lin Qingbei's star core, Ye Xiao also had the star cores of several other super-divine star beasts.</p><p></p><p>Because their main bodies tasted bad, Ye Xiao did not put them in the breeding ground to cultivate, but directly peeled the skin, removed the tendons, and dug out the star cores, preparing to refine them into pills in the future.</p><p></p><p>But Ye Xiao urgently needed to quickly improve his own strength, so he could only first consider refining those divine bloods to enhance the dragon qi in his body.</p><p></p><p>This time, he was closed in for three days and three nights, and finally completed the refinement of the divine blood of hundreds of billions of human tribe descendants extracted by the star beasts.</p><p></p><p>After refining this massive amount of energy, the dragon qi in Ye Xiao's body had risen from eight dragons to a full sixteen dragons. His strength had increased by a full fold compared to before.</p><p></p><p>Ye Xiao clenched his fists, feeling the more surging and turbulent power within him, and his inner confidence had increased a lot.</p><p></p><p>Indeed, if one wants to live at ease, one's fist must be hard enough.</p><p></p><p>Now Ye Xiao felt that if he faced Lin Qingbei again, a single punch could crush his head, and he would not give him any extra chances to display his fancy techniques.</p><p></p><p>"My current strength seems to be even stronger than Lin Qingbei's at that time!"</p><p></p><p>Lin Qingbei's previous cultivation was roughly equivalent to the Emperor Realm with nearly seven dragons.</p><p></p><p>In fact, he was originally ranked second on the Star Ranking, between Emperor and Cloud Emperor, so he should have had the strength of at least three dragons.</p><p></p><p>Later, his increase was less than four dragons, but Ye Xiao had increased by a full eight dragons, reaching the Emperor Realm of sixteen dragons.</p><p></p><p>However, upon careful consideration, Ye Xiao understood.</p><p></p><p>It was very likely that Lin Qingbei knew the divine tribes were about to descend, so he dared not delay any further and only refined a portion of the divine blood, hastily coming to fight Ye Xiao.</p><p></p><p>After all, he was forced by the situation, and if he didn't come to fight Ye Xiao, he wouldn't even have the chance to do so before the divine tribes descended.</p><p></p><p>Anyway, Ye Xiao was the ultimate winner in the end, and that was enough.</p><p></p><p>The hidden hand behind the star beasts, who had planned for hundreds of years, had all their accumulated divine blood completely taken by Ye Xiao.</p><p></p><p>After refining the divine blood, Ye Xiao finally came out of seclusion.</p><p></p><p>There were several missed calls on his phone, mostly from several senior figures.</p><p></p><p>Because Emperor had decided to keep Ye Xiao's identity secret and destroyed the network, all web pages and online chat tools were completely disabled, and only phone calls could still be made.</p><p></p><p>Ye Xiao casually dialed Xuanwu Venerable Jiang Chen's number, but it showed the other party was out of service area, probably due to spiritual energy interference.</p><p></p><p>He then dialed a few other numbers, and finally North Hall Strategist's number was answered.</p><p></p><p>"Hello! Ye Xiao, thank goodness! You finally contacted us."</p><p></p><p>"I want to know what the situation is like outside now?"</p><p></p><p>"The current situation is good, where are you? I'll come find you to talk."</p><p></p><p>"No need, if there's no one around you, I'll come find you to talk, I'm fast..."</p><p></p><p>Here is the full English translation of the Chinese excerpt:</p><p></p><p>"It's quite fast."</p><p></p><p>"Okay! I'm in the Central Prefecture City, and there's no one around me right now. Come over here. I'm in the library office."</p><p></p><p>"Alright."</p><p></p><p>Ye Xiao activated the Yin-Yang Escape Technique and instantly teleported to Beitang Ce's office.</p><p></p><p>After cultivating to the Sovereign Realm's Sixteen Dragons, his speed had doubled compared to before, becoming incredibly fast.</p><p></p><p>Beitang Ce had just hung up the phone when Ye Xiao instantly appeared in front of him.</p><p></p><p>"You startled me, that was so fast! You really are amazing!"</p><p></p><p>After a brief pause, he gestured to a chair for Ye Xiao.</p><p></p><p>"Have a seat first, let me pour you some water."</p><p></p><p>Ye Xiao nodded and sat down, and Beitang Ce poured two cups of tea, handing one to Ye Xiao.</p><p></p><p>"This time, several forces from the Xuanyuan Clan have descended. Through their introduction, we now have a good understanding of the Xuanyuan Clan.</p><p></p><p>The Xuanyuan Clan is a collective term for a group of tribes. Within the Xuanyuan Clan, there are many different forces of varying sizes.</p><p></p><p>These forces compete with each other to some extent, but overall, it's an internal competition without any particularly severe incidents.</p><p></p><p>The Xuanyuan Clan ranks quite high among the tribes in the starry sky, able to enter the top twenty or so.</p><p></p><p>In comparison, the Winged Clan, Thunder Clan, and Giant Ape Clan are far behind."</p><p></p><p>Hearing this, Ye Xiao finally understood why Lin Qingbei, after obtaining the divine blood of other clan descendants, did not choose to withdraw, but instead wanted to further obtain the divine blood of the Xuanyuan Clan descendants.</p><p></p><p>Because the Xuanyuan Clan ranks quite high, logically speaking, the divine blood of the Xuanyuan Clan would have a greater effect!</p><p></p><p>"Please continue."</p><p></p><p>"The Xuanyuan Clan forces that have come this time are the Divine Tiger Gate, Burial Dragon Fortress, Divine Wood Academy, Lingming Sect, and Raging Fire Sect.</p><p></p><p>They are generally quite satisfied with the descendants in our world and have conducted peaceful negotiations, and they will each take over five major regions of the Nine Prefectures.</p><p></p><p>And they will pass on more powerful cultivation methods to us, such as more Sovereign Techniques and the divine techniques we have never encountered before.</p><p></p><p>Cultivators like Jing Emperor, Azure Dragon, and some others like myself, Li Liushui, and Lu Qingshan who previously had relatively high strength in the Nine Prefectures, will also receive some special attention."</p><p></p><p>"That's quite good. How many powerful experts have they brought, and what cultivation levels are they at?"</p><p></p><p>"They've brought over a hundred, and apart from a few disciples and juniors at the King Realm accompanying their high-level experts, the vast majority are all Sovereign Realm cultivators! It's said that one of the strongest among them has already reached the Sixty-Four Dragons Sovereign Realm, which is truly terrifying.</p><p></p><p>And it's said that they will also send a Divine Realm expert to be stationed here."</p><p></p><p>Ye Xiao nodded, but he couldn't help feeling a bit doubtful in his heart.</p><p></p><p>It seems that the Xuanyuan Clan families summoned this time are not that impressive after all!</p><p></p><p>Over a hundred Sovereign Realm cultivators, plus a Sixty-Four Dragons Sovereign, while it may seem very strong, would actually have no trouble sweeping through this world, but placed among the Clan, they would probably not be that impressive.</p><p></p><p>Ye Xiao felt that the Divine Realm should be the bare minimum standard in the Clan, and there must be even stronger existences beyond that.</p><p></p><p>But thinking about it carefully, it's also easy to understand.</p><p></p><p>The human race in this world is essentially the dregs among the dregs, belonging to the Xuanyuan Clan, with their bloodline power already greatly diluted after generations of reproduction.</p><p></p><p>And their original ancestor in the Xuanyuan Clan was just an ordinary existence, not the kind of heaven-defying existence.</p><p></p><p>To put it bluntly, being recruited by these Xuanyuan Clan forces is already considered very fortunate for this world.</p><p></p><p>"So which force have you and the others chosen?"</p><p></p><p>"We didn't have a choice. It's impossible to concentrate all the outstanding warriors under a single force, that would be too unfair to the others.</p><p></p><p>The premise of fair negotiation is to prioritize fairness.</p><p></p><p>So we've been divided among the different forces. Elder Jing Emperor and Elder Bai Hu went to the Divine Tiger Gate, which is the strongest force!</p><p></p><p>I and Sword Saint Li Liushui have entered the Burial Dragon Fortress, which is taking over the Central Prefecture.</p><p></p><p>Elder ZhuQue joined the Raging Fire Sect, as their Raging Fire Sword Technique matches well with her cultivation.</p><p></p><p>Elder Azure Dragon and Sword Saint Lu Qingshan joined the Lingming Sect, which specializes in sword cultivation.</p><p></p><p>Elder Xuanwu joined the Divine Wood Academy, which is taking over your Jianghai City.</p><p></p><p>Oh, and after arriving in this world, they naturally also inquired about your existence from others, and they had asked us about the Sword Immortal, but we haven't responded to them yet.</p><p></p><p>Elder Jing Emperor's intention is to let you choose for yourself. Whether to join these sects, or what else to do?"</p><p></p><p>Ye Xiao thought about it for a moment, and he already had an answer in his heart.</p><p></p><p>This is the end of the first update, 3,000 words.</p><p></p><p>Please recommend and vote for monthly tickets.</p><p></p><p>Thank you to book friends Time and People, book friend Extremely Happy, book friend Tao, book friend Emperor Hongshi, and book friend TOP's Favorite Baby for the donations, greatly appreciated.</p><p></p><p>(This chapter is complete)</p>

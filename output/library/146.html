        <h1>Chapter 146</h1>
        <div class="content">
            <p>Here is the full English translation of the Chinese excerpt:</p><p></p><p>Ye Xiao: "?"</p><p></p><p>What is she doing? She's actually rolling up her sleeves and practicing punches at the window!</p><p></p><p>Although her arms are not thick, the muscles look especially powerful!</p><p></p><p>Is this really a woman's arm?</p><p></p><p>Why does it feel much stronger than Ning Yuheng's?</p><p></p><p>Compared to Ning Yuheng, this is truly the manliest of men!</p><p></p><p>"Shouldn't you be checking the books? Why are you practicing punches?" </p><p></p><p>Ye Xiao couldn't help but speak up.</p><p></p><p>Yang Qian stopped her movements and immediately replied:</p><p></p><p>"I got used to it when I was in the military camp, to practice punches before doing anything. Is that not allowed? Then I won't do it."</p><p></p><p>"It's fine, as long as you don't make any noise."</p><p></p><p>"Thank you, manager."</p><p></p><p>At this moment, Ye Xiao felt that the people around him were getting stranger and stranger.</p><p></p><p>Starting from Gu Hai, who was always up to no good, going to the bathhouse and then getting swept by the garrison. As for Ning Yuheng, she was just eating a peach! And now there's Yang Qian, who looks decent but has a rather masculine personality.</p><p></p><p>As the saying goes, "birds of a feather flock together." Does that mean he's also an oddball? No way, right? No way, no way, no way!</p><p></p><p>With his upright values, exceptional talent, and good looks, how could he possibly be an oddball?</p><p></p><p>Ye Xiao shook his head, feeling that the eccentrics around him were too many, making him a bit neurotic and start doubting himself.</p><p></p><p>Ah! It's better to just read the books.</p><p></p><p>After the last palm technique was completed, Ye Xiao could let the Golden Book Spiritual Consciousness cultivate it, and then he could move on to other techniques.</p><p></p><p>The Golden Book Spiritual Consciousness quickly cultivated the last palm technique to the great perfection realm.</p><p></p><p>In this way, all of Ye Xiao's palm techniques had become pure golden in color, and could be integrated at any time.</p><p></p><p>However, he would have to wait until after work, because if he integrated them now, it would release a golden light.</p><p></p><p>In the afternoon after work, Ye Xiao could leave first, and the cleaning and other work could naturally be taken care of by Yang Qian.</p><p></p><p>Ye Xiao would then directly return home to integrate the techniques.</p><p></p><p>The Golden Book radiated brilliant light, refining all the basic fist techniques.</p><p></p><p>"Om Mani Padme Hum!" These few words were so familiar, they were the six-character true words of Buddhism.</p><p></p><p>Ye Xiao remembered that in his previous life when he watched the TV series "Journey to the West", Tathagata had pressed these words on the peak of the Five Elements Mountain! The next moment, the six big words directly combined into a technique with a huge golden Buddha palm.</p><p></p><p>The Divine Palm of Tathagata!</p><p></p><p>"It's actually the Divine Palm of Tathagata!" </p><p></p><p>Ye Xiao couldn't help but exclaim in surprise.</p><p></p><p>Previously, Fa Zheng had said that the Divine Palm of Tathagata was the most powerful and destructive technique in the Buddhist sect.</p><p></p><p>He had said it was a cultivation method, not just a palm technique.</p><p></p><p>That means the power of the Divine Palm of Tathagata has already surpassed the realm of just palm techniques, and is extremely powerful in the entire martial arts world!</p><p></p><p>Moreover, Fa Zheng had also said that the Divine Palm of Tathagata had been lost for many years, and unexpectedly, it was now combined by his own Golden Book Spiritual Consciousness.</p><p></p><p>This time he was really lucky.</p><p></p><p>He didn't know if it was because of Yang Qian's arrival, if so, she really is a lucky charm!</p><p></p><p>Ye Xiao immediately had the Golden Book Spiritual Consciousness start cultivating the Divine Palm of Tathagata. He was a bit impatient to see the power of such a powerful technique.</p><p></p><p>However, judging from the progress, it doesn't seem to be too fast, and it might not be until tomorrow that the cultivation will be completely finished.</p><p></p><p>Ye Xiao was not in a hurry, he'll just take it slowly.</p><p></p><p>First, he'll take a nap, treating it as idle cultivation.</p><p></p><p>As the night deepened, Jianghai City fell into a quiet silence.</p><p></p><p>Most people had already fallen asleep.</p><p></p><p>But at this moment, a golden-brown light quietly flew to the top floor of the library.</p><p></p><p>It was a very plump old hen.</p><p></p><p>After arriving, she first looked around and saw that the street was empty, then immediately spread her wings and glided down to the statue of the Immortal Swordsman.</p><p></p><p>She then transformed back into a human form, which was Jifeng!</p><p></p><p>"This should be the place."</p><p></p><p>After transforming back into human form, she immediately lay on the ground and used her spiritual power to communicate with Noel Fei beneath the ground.</p><p></p><p>"Senior Noel Fei, are you down there?"</p><p></p><p>Noel Fei's split body, who was cultivating in the darkness, suddenly paused, then asked with puzzlement, "What beast are you?"</p><p></p><p>"To answer the senior, I am Jifeng of the Phoenix Chicken Clan. I heard that the senior is here, so I specially came to assist you. I will break the formation and lead our Star Beast Clan to revive our glory and destroy the human race!"</p><p></p><p>"I see."</p><p></p><p>"Senior, I'll break the formation now to let you out."</p><p></p><p>"Wait a moment!"</p><p></p><p>Noel Fei hurriedly stopped her.</p><p></p><p>This was an emperor-level formation after all!</p><p></p><p>He could feel that Jifeng's cultivation was only at the Xiantian Seventh-Grade Saint Monarch Realm. With this level of cultivation, it was absolutely impossible for her to instantly break this formation.</p><p></p><p>But if she couldn't break the formation in one go, it might attract that human prodigy.</p><p></p><p>That guy not only had strong cultivation, but was also ruthless and cruel.</p><p></p><p>Here is the full English translation of the Chinese excerpt:</p><p></p><p>"Comrade.</p><p></p><p>He didn't even blink an eye when he was cutting himself.</p><p></p><p>If he came over and saw someone trying to save him, and got angry, and directly shattered the seal, and cut me down, then this offshoot of mine would have nowhere to be buried.</p><p></p><p>This absolutely cannot happen! I need to preserve this offshoot, waiting to use it to rescue the main body that is imprisoned in the Shaolin Seventy-Two Demon Pits.</p><p></p><p>The risk is too great.</p><p></p><p>"Senior Noel Fis, why won't you let me save you? Don't you want to come out?"</p><p></p><p>Noel Fis was silent for a moment, pondered briefly, and then spoke:</p><p></p><p>"It's like this, in this city, there is a human sect master expert. The main body is worried that if you can't break the formation array immediately, you might end up attracting him over.</p><p></p><p>You know, if it was the main body out there, dealing with him would be a piece of cake, easily slaying him.</p><p></p><p>But you can't do it, your cultivation is not enough.</p><p></p><p>The main body is worried that while you are trying to break the seal, if you accidentally attract him to sneak attack you, you might perish, and the main body would be unable to go out and save you.</p><p></p><p>So, we can't stir up the hornets' nest for now."</p><p></p><p>"Oh? I see. Then what should I do, junior?"</p><p></p><p>"You do this, first go find him, see if he is in this city.</p><p></p><p>If he is in this city, then don't be in a hurry to make a move for now, if he is not in this city, then you can make your move later."</p><p></p><p>"As expected of Senior Noel Fis, truly formidable, trapped in the seal, yet you have already prepared a strategy in advance. If I can rescue you, I will surely be able to lead our Star Beast Clan to glory."</p><p></p><p>Noel Fis chuckled dryly.</p><p></p><p>He actually just wanted Jifeng to go probe a bit.</p><p></p><p>Whether he can break the seal or not is secondary, the most important thing is, he absolutely must not provoke Ye Xiao to come, otherwise he would be truly doomed.</p><p></p><p>"Senior Noel Fis, I will go look for him now, but what does he look like? Could the senior please describe him for me?"</p><p></p><p>"I have only seen him by chance once, he is a young human expert, he used a powerful sword technique that I have never seen before, and can also set up formations.</p><p></p><p>I don't know who he is, the only thing I remember is that he is very handsome, wearing a black jacket and pants, the rest I'm not sure about."</p><p></p><p>Jifeng was stunned for a moment.</p><p></p><p>"Senior, your description is too vague, there are many handsome human males, how am I supposed to find him?"</p><p></p><p>"He is different, he should be considered a rare high-quality male.</p><p></p><p>But you're right, just relying on appearance, it's still not easy to find him.</p><p></p><p>Alright, I'll put a wisp of my divine sense on you, if you see him, I'll remind you.</p><p></p><p>That way you'll be able to find him easier."</p><p></p><p>Jifeng was overjoyed.</p><p></p><p>"The senior is truly remarkable, bold and strategic, I admire you."</p><p></p><p>Soon, Noel Fis pushed out a wisp of his divine sense from below, just a tiny bit, without any killing power, this was the only way he could divide it out.</p><p></p><p>Ye Xiao's formation array was truly too strong, even a little bit of powerful energy medium could not escape.</p><p></p><p>After receiving Noel Fis' divine sense, Jifeng immediately took her leave.</p><p></p><p>"Senior, I'll go look for that guy, please wait a moment."</p><p></p><p>"Mm, go."</p><p></p><p>Jifeng immediately transformed back into her Star Beast form, flapped her wings, and took off into the sky above Jianghai City, circling around as a beam of light.</p><p></p><p>Her sharp vision was constantly scanning the entire Jianghai City, but she still could not find Ye Xiao.</p><p></p><p>Normally, at the Patriarch realm, being able to conceal one's aura is already very difficult, only existences far surpassing that level would have a chance of finding him.</p><p></p><p>And Ye Xiao's cultivation has already reached the Divine Patriarch realm.</p><p></p><p>Plus he has also cultivated a spiritual technique, unless he himself, no one else can find him.</p><p></p><p>Time flashed by, and it was already the next morning.</p><p></p><p>After waking up, the first thing Ye Xiao did was to check his Golden Book Spiritual Sense.</p><p></p><p>Very good, the Tathagata Divine Palm has been cultivated to the Great Perfection realm.</p><p></p><p>Feeling the extremely tyrannical and powerful killing intent contained in the Tathagata Divine Palm, Ye Xiao felt quite excited and reassured in his heart.</p><p></p><p>In the future, he has another powerful life-saving technique.</p><p></p><p>At the same time, he checked his own cultivation.</p><p></p><p>His Innate Seventh Grade cultivation has already accumulated half the way to the Innate Eighth Grade realm.</p><p></p><p>That is to say, his cultivation will soon breakthrough again, reaching the Innate Eighth Grade.</p><p></p><p>Looking at this situation, it seems that in less than a year, he should be able to break through to the Innate Ninth Grade, the peak of the Divine Patriarch realm.</p><p></p><p>There are still four years until the next Demon Beast Calamity.</p><p></p><p>That means, by the time he reaches the Divine Patriarch peak, he can still continue to hide in the Library for three more years.</p><p></p><p>Three years, that should be enough.</p><p></p><p>Although he doesn't know exactly how much cultivation is required to break through to the King Realm, Ye Xiao believes that even if he can't break through, with the accumulation of three years, and all those Emperor Techniques, it should be enough to preserve his life when the next Demon Beast Calamity arrives.</p><p></p><p>(Chapter End)</p>

        <h1>Chapter 412</h1>
        <div class="content">
            <p>Here is the full English translation of the Chinese excerpt:</p><p></p><p>This statement immediately silenced everyone present.</p><p></p><p>But soon, Ning Yicheng shook his head and said:</p><p></p><p>"It's unlikely. Pill refining, combat strength, formations, healing arts, body techniques, and the like are not of the same type - they are completely different and brand-new domains.</p><p></p><p>If the other party can easily create pill refining, wouldn't that make him an all-rounded talent who can do anything?</p><p></p><p>As the common saying goes: no one is perfect.</p><p></p><p>No matter how extraordinary the Sword Immortal is, he must still have his own weaknesses.</p><p></p><p>To say that he can also refine pills, and his pill refining abilities are so monstrous, I absolutely don't believe it."</p><p></p><p>The crowd also nodded slightly.</p><p></p><p>This explanation was somewhat reasonable.</p><p></p><p>Up to now, the methods the Sword Immortal has revealed to outsiders are already numerous, and each one is extraordinarily powerful.</p><p></p><p>Even if he is extraordinary, there must be a limit, right? If not, why wouldn't he reveal his true identity in front of everyone, but has been hiding himself all along?</p><p></p><p>"Unexpectedly, the human world actually has such a high-level expert! Could it be that this world not only has the Sword Immortal, but also many other super powerhouses?"</p><p></p><p>"This is really strange. The human race in this world is merely the ordinary descendants of the Xuanyuan Clan, how could they possess such a powerful bloodline and give birth to so many extraordinary descendants?"</p><p></p><p>The crowd was really puzzled.</p><p></p><p>This matter soon calmed down, and the bustling atmosphere in Jianghai City was restored.</p><p></p><p>But Ye Xiao did not relax because of this.</p><p></p><p>As the night deepened, with the moon high in the sky and everyone else in the dream realm, Ye Xiao came to a roadside and opened a porcelain bottle, releasing a pool of blood-red liquid from within.</p><p></p><p>Upon closer inspection, one would find that this was actually countless tiny insects, not a liquid.</p><p></p><p>It's just that they were gathered so densely, and each individual was extremely small, so they appeared to be a pool of liquid when combined.</p><p></p><p>These are the Blood Butterflies.</p><p></p><p>Their bodies contain an extremely powerful blood qi and spiritual energy.</p><p></p><p>If Ye Xiao were to fully refine this blood qi power, it could slightly increase his strength, not enough to break through to the fifth realm of the Deicide Realm, but it would be equivalent to half a month's worth of his blood qi cultivation.</p><p></p><p>But Ye Xiao did not absorb and refine these blood qi.</p><p></p><p>Sometimes, one needs to cast a long line to catch the big fish, and have the patience to wait.</p><p></p><p>If one cannot endure, they will never be able to eat the final, fattest prey.</p><p></p><p>In the darkness, the Blood Butterflies followed a peculiar path and penetrated into the ground beneath the road. After leaving the human body, they had to travel through the damp soil underground at the fastest speed.</p><p></p><p>After the Blood Butterflies left the human body, Ye Xiao had many ways to sense them - spiritual power, perception, and eye power. Unless he wanted to personally release them, these Blood Butterflies could never escape his tracking.</p><p></p><p>The Blood Butterflies were quickly advancing forward, while Ye Xiao calmly followed behind them with his hands clasped behind his back.</p><p></p><p>After about ten minutes of walking, Ye Xiao stopped at the entrance of the Ning family manor.</p><p></p><p>This made him raise his eyebrows slightly.</p><p></p><p>"The Ning family? Why would the Blood Butterflies come to the Ning family manor? Could it be that this Blood Butterfly plague was actually caused by the Ning family people?</p><p></p><p>But... didn't the Ning family also have people who planted the Blood Butterfly plague?"</p><p></p><p>Ye Xiao vaguely felt that something was not quite right.</p><p></p><p>He withdrew the group of Blood Butterflies he had released, and was about to enter the manor to investigate, when suddenly he was slightly surprised.</p><p></p><p>Because his perception detected that there were a few more groups of Blood Butterflies rapidly surging into the Ning family manor from underground.</p><p></p><p>Ye Xiao narrowed his eyes, put on his cloak, and slowly stepped into the manor.</p><p></p><p>Meanwhile, in the deepest part of the Ning family manor, in the room where the obsidian coffin excavated from the Divine King's Tomb was stored, a faint and unusual fluctuation suddenly emerged.</p><p></p><p>Crack, crack, one of the huge obsidian coffins began to emit cracks.</p><p></p><p>Shortly after, a few drops of fresh blood seeped out from within.</p><p></p><p>The blood dripped onto the ground and merged with the Blood Butterflies emerging from the earth, forming a figure with a completely black body but with a white crescent moon mark on its back.</p><p></p><p>"Hahaha, how many years has it been? I, the King, have finally broken this damned seal. Nalan Divine Emperor, you could never have imagined that after countless years, you have already become the dust of history.</p><p></p><p>But I, Alpha King, am still alive, aren't I? In the end, I am the one who gets the last laugh."</p><p></p><p>This voice caught the attention of the Ning family disciples guarding outside.</p><p></p><p>"Who's in there?"</p><p></p><p>A few figures rushed in, and upon seeing the Alpha King, they were immediately startled.</p><p></p><p>"Who are you?"</p><p></p><p>The Alpha King's mouth curled up slightly, his eyes revealing a greedy look.</p><p></p><p>He did not respond to their words, but merely stomped his foot, instantly transforming into a residual image and disappearing from the spot.</p><p></p><p>He reappeared in front of the crowd.</p><p></p><p>"So fast!"</p><p></p><p>The crowd's pupils constricted, and they couldn't help but exclaim in surprise, but before they could resist, the Alpha King struck like lightning, and in the blink of an eye, he had sent several people to their deaths.</p><p></p><p>These people were all Deity Realm cultivators, but in the face of the Alpha King, they were utterly powerless.</p><p></p><p>Here is my translation of the Chinese excerpt:</p><p></p><p>Alpha King's hands could not withstand even a single move.</p><p></p><p>After slaying several people, Alpha King opened his blood-red jaws, his fangs protruding, and sank them directly into the necks of the people, frantically devouring their divine blood. In the blink of an eye, he had completely consumed their divine blood.</p><p></p><p>His aura also surged again, quickly rising to the Deicide Realm's fourth layer.</p><p></p><p>He licked his sharp fangs, his eyes gleaming with a bloodthirsty light.</p><p></p><p>"There are still many powerful auras in this manor, with cultivations at least at the Emperor Realm, and even many existences above the Divine Realm. </p><p></p><p>If I can devour everyone in this manor, my cultivation can recover to around the eighth layer of the Deicide Realm, not far from restoring to the Divine King Realm."</p><p></p><p>However, at this moment, an unexpected event occurred. </p><p></p><p>He looked towards the doorway, his eyes narrowing slightly.</p><p></p><p>There, a figure in a cloak and hat had appeared, though he did not know when.</p><p></p><p>Although he was no longer at the Divine King Realm, his battle experience and Divine King-level perception remained.</p><p></p><p>So even though Ye Xiao had not revealed his aura, he could still sense that Ye Xiao's cultivation was around the fourth layer of the Deicide Realm.</p><p></p><p>"The fourth layer of the Deicide Realm, how interesting. It seems you have come to offer your divine blood to me. Hand over your divine blood."</p><p></p><p>As the words fell, divine power burst forth, and his body shot towards Ye Xiao like a blood-red dragon. In an instant, he was in front of Ye Xiao.</p><p></p><p>His right hand extended like a dragon's claw, and even before touching Ye Xiao, an extremely powerful restraining force had locked down Ye Xiao's body.</p><p></p><p>It was the Claw Technique! The Nine Star Divine Art!</p><p></p><p>Ye Xiao, who had cultivated the Nine Star Divine Art Claw Technique Plucking the Stars, instantly recognized it.</p><p></p><p>"Die!"</p><p></p><p>A trace of pride appeared on the corners of Alpha King's mouth, as if he had already seen Ye Xiao's death.</p><p></p><p>However, just as he was feeling smug, the next moment, his body suddenly stopped.</p><p></p><p>He had been restrained by an even greater power! In front of Ye Xiao, he remained frozen in the position of his outstretched right hand.</p><p></p><p>Alpha King's pupils shrank, his eyes filled with disbelief!</p><p></p><p>"How is this possible? My cultivation has already recovered to the fourth layer of the Deicide Realm, and it should be on par with yours. How could this happen?"</p><p></p><p>Ye Xiao did not answer, but directly unleashed the Annihilation Divine Art.</p><p></p><p>"Boom!"</p><p></p><p>The overwhelming power of the Annihilation Divine Art directly caused Alpha King to spit out a mouthful of fresh blood, his aura instantly plummeting to the freezing point.</p><p></p><p>"Puchi!"</p><p></p><p>Alpha King's pupils dimmed.</p><p></p><p>A heavy blow! Ye Xiao's instinctive one-hit kill, but he did not do so.</p><p></p><p>Pei Qi and the others did not know about the Ancient Divine Realm, and Alpha King absolutely knew about it!</p><p></p><p>Alpha King was terrified to the extreme.</p><p></p><p>The sudden and yet instantly devastating technique he had just witnessed was so familiar.</p><p></p><p>This level of skill was something he had only seen in the hands of the supreme rulers of the Ancient Divine Realm.</p><p></p><p>It was the Sovereign's Art! It was a technique developed by Divine Emperor-level experts to explore the heavens and the laws of nature!</p><p></p><p>It was the mightiest power in the starry sky! Only such power could instantly devastate him, who possessed the Nine Star Divine Art.</p><p></p><p>No wonder, no wonder the person in front of him, with only the Deicide Realm, dared to face him directly.</p><p></p><p>No wonder, even with the same cultivation, he could not even twitch a muscle.</p><p></p><p>He had enough confidence to subdue the former Divine King, who was now only at the fourth layer of the Deicide Realm.</p><p></p><p>"Who are you exactly?"</p><p></p><p>Alpha King, with a slight trembling in his voice, asked the question deep within his heart.</p><p></p><p>Ye Xiao did not answer him, but directly unleashed the Great Dao Divine Sense.</p><p></p><p>The powerful spiritual power instantly struck Alpha King's soul, causing his body to shudder involuntarily.</p><p></p><p>He gritted his teeth, his divine soul instinctively resisting, trying to resist Ye Xiao's spiritual scan.</p><p></p><p>But unfortunately, the Alpha King, who had just been heavily injured by Ye Xiao, was now extremely weak.</p><p></p><p>Moreover, he had not cultivated any spiritual techniques, so he had no way to resist Ye Xiao's Nine Star Spiritual Divine Art.</p><p></p><p>Pu ci!</p><p></p><p>Accompanied by a slight sound, Alpha King knew that his soul defense had been breached.</p><p></p><p>Ye Xiao's spiritual power ruthlessly invaded his soul, constantly extending and scanning every barrier within his soul.</p><p></p><p>Alpha King was drenched in cold sweat.</p><p></p><p>He knew he had no way to resist, in the face of this person, he was just a tiny ant!</p><p></p><p>His eyes darting, he gritted his teeth and said:</p><p></p><p>"Great one, Alpha knows his strength is still decent, although my current cultivation is only at the fourth layer of the Deicide Realm, as long as you give me some time, I can quickly recover to the Divine King Realm! Alpha can serve you."</p>

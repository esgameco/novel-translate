        <h1>Chapter 363</h1>
        <div class="content">
            <p>Here is the full English translation of the Chinese excerpt:</p><p></p><p>It was clearly done with some body techniques.</p><p></p><p>"Ye Xiao, long time no see."</p><p></p><p>Ye Xiao raised his head, glanced at her, and nodded.</p><p></p><p>"You've returned from the starry sky?"</p><p></p><p>The visitor was none other than Qin Yuyan.</p><p></p><p>She nodded gently.</p><p></p><p>"Mm-hmm."</p><p></p><p>Then she couldn't help but ask, "Just now, there was an elderly man who left. Did you notice what he came here for?"</p><p></p><p>Ye Xiao knew Qin Yuyan was asking about Bei Tang Ce.</p><p></p><p>After all, Bei Tang Ce was somewhat of a celebrity.</p><p></p><p>She must have heard of him before.</p><p></p><p>To this, Ye Xiao shook his head.</p><p></p><p>"No, I didn't see him. I was just reading a book the whole time."</p><p></p><p>"Alright then."</p><p></p><p>Qin Yuyan was a little disappointed, but she quickly regained her normal mood, then took a small porcelain bottle out of her pocket.</p><p></p><p>"Here, as I said before, you helped me learn the method of stealing from divine tombs, so I'll give you some reward. </p><p></p><p>This is a divine pill I found in the starry sky. It's an emperor pill, with abundant spiritual energy. I'll give it to you."</p><p></p><p>The emperor pill was already a very generous reward.</p><p></p><p>It was clear that this girl Qin Yuyan was quite sincere.</p><p></p><p>"No need to be so polite, you can take it back. Helping you was just a small favor, the emperor pill is too precious."</p><p></p><p>Qin Yuyan smiled wryly.</p><p></p><p>"It's you who shouldn't be so polite. This time in the starry sky, I obtained many good things.</p><p></p><p>The emperor pill is not that precious to me anymore. I have quite a few of them, you keep it."</p><p></p><p>Ye Xiao couldn't be bothered to refuse further, nodded, and accepted it.</p><p></p><p>"Then thank you."</p><p></p><p>The reason he accepted Qin Yuyan's things was mainly because he felt that Qin Yuyan and himself were not quite on the same level.</p><p></p><p>She was not like the senior Bei Tang Ce and the others, with whom he could only be considered ordinary friends.</p><p></p><p>So between the two of them, there was less formality, more of a business-like relationship.</p><p></p><p>Even though he accepted Qin Yuyan's things, in the future, if she came to borrow books or something, he would also give her some guidance in return.</p><p></p><p>It was a mutually beneficial arrangement.</p><p></p><p>Ye Xiao noticed that Qin Yuyan's cultivation had broken through another realm, reaching the strength of the Xiantian Eighth Grade.</p><p></p><p>This couldn't help but make Ye Xiao puzzled.</p><p></p><p>Because normally, Qin Yuyan's cultivation speed should be on par with seniors like Bei Tang Ce, at most a little better than them.</p><p></p><p>But now, her cultivation speed had clearly improved much more than the other seniors.</p><p></p><p>This was quite puzzling.</p><p></p><p>Ye Xiao used his spiritual power to probe Qin Yuyan, and suddenly discovered some strange differences.</p><p></p><p>Qin Yuyan's divine blood, the blood qi within it, was slightly more concentrated than other people's divine blood, though not as strong as his own.</p><p></p><p>But the problem was, Ye Xiao's divine blood qi was so powerful because he had absorbed a large amount of divine blood before his tribulation ascension, including the blood of Jiang King, the Divine Stele, and the blood of his ancestors.</p><p></p><p>He had essentially concentrated and refined the divine blood of dozens of people.</p><p></p><p>However, Qin Yuyan had done nothing, yet she had already surpassed ordinary people.</p><p></p><p>Could it be that she had eaten some heavenly treasure? But heavenly treasures shouldn't have such a powerful effect.</p><p></p><p>Or was it that her ancestral lineage had someone who had cultivated to a very high level, and she indirectly benefited from it?</p><p></p><p>But this theory didn't work either, because she and Ye Xiao were both descendants of the twenty-something Xuanyuan Clan, with the same ancestors.</p><p></p><p>There was no reason for the breakthrough of one branch's ancestor to only benefit her blood qi, and not his.</p><p></p><p>"Why have you been staring at me the whole time?"</p><p></p><p>Qin Yuyan was a bit puzzled.</p><p></p><p>She didn't think Ye Xiao had any special feelings for her, she knew he wasn't that kind of person.</p><p></p><p>He didn't have the lecherous thoughts that some other men had when seeing a beautiful woman.</p><p></p><p>Ye Xiao retracted his gaze.</p><p></p><p>"It's nothing. Since you just returned from the starry sky, you should rest more, to avoid any disturbances in your state of mind."</p><p></p><p>"Yes, you're right. I'll go back and rest soon. Can you help me find a few books, still related to formations? I want to learn more.</p><p></p><p>That way, if I encounter some higher-level tombs, I can try going in."</p><p></p><p>Ye Xiao replied calmly:</p><p></p><p>"On the left side of the 7th row, there are three books. In the 5th layer of the 9th row, there are a few books. On the upper right of the 15th row, there are two books. They are mostly about imperial formations. You seem to have already advanced to the Divine Sect level, right? With your cultivation, you should be able to understand these books, and you have the qualifications to borrow them.</p><p></p><p>For even higher-level ones, you may need even stronger strength."</p><p></p><p>Here is my translation of the Chinese excerpt:</p><p></p><p>These are enough, the divine tombs in the starry sky don't have divine formations, at most they are just imperial formations."</p><p></p><p>She took the book, Ye Xiao handled the borrowing procedures for her, Qin Yuyan bid farewell and left.</p><p></p><p>Ye Xiao then continued reading the book.</p><p></p><p>At the same time, in the starry sky, in the temporary command post jointly constructed by the three divine tribes, the atmosphere was solemn and had a hint of gunpowder.</p><p></p><p>"The recent movements of the Xuanyuan Divine Tribe have become increasingly greater."</p><p></p><p>"This group of Xuanyuan Divine Tribe, they are really too greedy. They are ranked 19th in power among the races in the starry sky, but they are acting like a dog that has never eaten meat, their eating manners are so unsightly!</p><p></p><p>They have really lost all sense of shame."</p><p></p><p>The crowd spoke one after another, their words revealing much ill will and complaint.</p><p></p><p>However, Katomer was staring thoughtfully at the starry sky outside.</p><p></p><p>"Don't you all find this a bit abnormal? If I remember correctly, when the Xuanyuan Divine Tribe first arrived, their speed was not much different from ours.</p><p></p><p>And there are so many tombs in this starry sky, it's absolutely impossible to finish them in a short time. Under these circumstances, the Xuanyuan Divine Tribe really has no need to show such anxious ambition."</p><p></p><p>Another powerful expert of the Gorilla Divine Tribe, Baburu, spoke up:</p><p></p><p>"Do you suspect the Xuanyuan Divine Tribe has found something good?"</p><p></p><p>Katomer shook his head.</p><p></p><p>"I'm not too clear about this, I don't dare to draw conclusions rashly. My view is more inclined to believe that they have discovered something good, but haven't found it yet, and are now in the stage of searching for it."</p><p></p><p>"Regardless, the abnormal movements of the Xuanyuan Divine Tribe are worthy of our vigilance. This matter must be investigated thoroughly.</p><p></p><p>I heard that the Xuanyuan Clan has recently replaced a batch of ground excavators. The Xuanyuan Divine Tribe has now arranged most of their disciples in the starry sky tombs, their ground defense is very weak."</p><p></p><p>The crowd exchanged glances, the answer already in their eyes.</p><p></p><p>Since the ground defense of the Xuanyuan Divine Tribe is weak, and there are just-replaced excavators.</p><p></p><p>As long as they go and investigate, they may be able to find out something, and it may be greatly beneficial to them.</p><p></p><p>On Ye Xiao's side, he continued mining, the progress had already reached around 4% from the initial 0.3%.</p><p></p><p>According to this situation, Ye Xiao estimated that to completely dig through the entire dragon vein and thoroughly open the divine national treasury, it would still take more than two years.</p><p></p><p>This time is really too long, how much divine crystal will he have to dig up in the end!</p><p></p><p>The divine crystals in the jade token had already piled up into countless great mountains, Ye Xiao himself had a hard time counting how many there were.</p><p></p><p>His daily life was still just going back and forth, extremely simple.</p><p></p><p>Until that day, two figures silently entered the Jianghai City.</p><p></p><p>"This is the Jianghai City where the human race of the Nine States resides. It is currently one of the five major gathering places of the human race of the Nine States."</p><p></p><p>"There are also many excavators who have gone to the starry sky from the Jianghai City side, our spy found a list from the body of a dead Xuanyuan Divine Tribe excavator.</p><p></p><p>There are many excavators in Jianghai City, there is one called Liu Chengxun, one called Bao Jianshen, and one called Du Changfeng, among them, one who just came down recently is called Qin Yuyan.</p><p></p><p>She should know some information."</p><p></p><p>"Let's go, find someone to inquire about her identity and whereabouts."</p><p></p><p>The two figures, their faces slightly turned, in the blink of an eye, they transformed into two other people, looking no different from the Xuanyuan descendants below.</p><p></p><p>Evidently, the two had used a disguise technique.</p><p></p><p>They quickly came to the ground, and there was no one around paying extra attention to them, flying was already a common occurrence in the world of cultivators.</p><p></p><p>The two followed a young person carrying books and holding a cup of bubble tea.</p><p></p><p>"That's him."</p><p></p><p>"Let's go up."</p><p></p><p>The two followed him, while that figure, with an expressionless face, walked forward.</p><p></p><p>He was none other than Ye Xiao.</p><p></p><p>He had already sensed the two of them, and also sensed their identities - one was from the Wing Divine Tribe, the other was from the Thunder Divine Tribe.</p><p></p><p>They were in disguise.</p><p></p><p>Ye Xiao could more or less guess the reason why these two divine tribes came to Jianghai City.</p><p></p><p>Recently, due to the news of the discovery of the Divine King's Tomb, Ningzhiyuan had urged the Xuanyuan Divine Tribe to accelerate the excavation.</p><p></p><p>This would inevitably encroach on the interests of other divine tribes, and make other divine tribes feel worried.</p><p></p><p>Under such circumstances, the three unknown tribes sending people to investigate is also very normal.</p><p></p><p>However, these two people are really too discerning? After arriving here, they didn't look for anyone else, but directly targeted him.</p><p></p><p>This made Ye Xiao feel very puzzled.</p><p></p><p>Is he looking particularly pitiful? He found that this kind of thing often happens to him, rather than to others.</p><p></p><p>This kind of thing has happened several times, Ye Xiao can't completely believe that it's just because of bad luck.</p><p></p><p>Well, if he remembered correctly, there was a small alley up ahead, he could interrogate them there.</p><p></p><p>See what these two guys are here for.</p>

        <h1>Chapter 396</h1>
        <div class="content">
            <p>Here is the full English translation of the Chinese excerpt:</p><p></p><p>It was not just the changes in his divine physique, but also his perception, spiritual power, and divine soul. Ye Xiao felt that all of his powers had undergone comprehensive enhancement.</p><p></p><p>This feeling was akin to having a heavy burden lifted off your body - originally you could only jump a few centimeters high, but now you can jump dozens of centimeters high! The enhancement of one's strength not only represents one's own power, but also the diminished suppressive force of the real world on you.</p><p></p><p>If one had to use an adjective to describe it, it would be comparable to the change in universal gravitation.</p><p></p><p>Normal people definitely cannot jump high on Earth, but on the Moon, it would be vastly different.</p><p></p><p>"I've finally succeeded, stepping into the Deicide Realm!" </p><p></p><p>Ye Xiao clenched his fist, the corners of his mouth slightly upturned, his gaze filled with confidence. As if he could accomplish anything.</p><p></p><p>This feeling of growing stronger was truly amazing!</p><p></p><p>The endless lightning bolts from the sky were still raining down, but due to Ye Xiao's enhanced strength, although he could still feel a slight sting, they no longer posed any threat to his life safety.</p><p></p><p>Ye Xiao looked at the heavenly tribulation in the sky, waving his right hand, and the Great Dragon appeared in his palm.</p><p></p><p>With the Annihilation Arcane Art added, Ye Xiao unleashed a single sword strike.</p><p></p><p>Just that one strike! In the next instant, the entire meteor swarm was split open, and the purple tribulation cloud in the sky was completely divided into two, spreading out for tens of thousands of zhang.</p><p></p><p>The lightning immediately ceased, and after being split apart, it no longer had the power to attack Ye Xiao at all.</p><p></p><p>At this moment, the entire starry sky fell silent, everything once again returning to tranquility.</p><p></p><p>Gazing at the tribulation in the sky that he had cleaved with a single sword, Ye Xiao's eyes revealed a look of approval.</p><p></p><p>Not bad, the power of the Deicide Realm has already reached his expectations.</p><p></p><p>With his current strength, he would have a chance to go head-to-head with Yunshui.</p><p></p><p>Yunshui's cultivation was at the fifth layer of the Deicide Realm, and there was a gap between them. </p><p></p><p>But Ye Xiao had the Ancient Treasure Art, which Yunshui did not possess.</p><p></p><p>There was another important comparative data point.</p><p></p><p>Ye Xiao's main cultivation was in the Beast Taming Art, which was a support-type profession, not a frontline combat type.</p><p></p><p>They would rely on training and secret techniques to enhance the strength of their spirit beasts, while also using the spirit beasts' support to improve their own power.</p><p></p><p>In other words, the Beast Tamer's own combat prowess was not high, they solely depended on their spirit beasts, and all the powerful spirit beasts were now in Ye Xiao's hands.</p><p></p><p>Ye Xiao had no need to fear Yunshui.</p><p></p><p>However, Ye Xiao would not actively seek him out either.</p><p></p><p>While he was not afraid of Yunshui, he still needed to be cautious, as one never knew what trump cards the Yun family might have hidden.</p><p></p><p>What if they had another fifth layer Deicide Realm combat-type cultivator?</p><p></p><p>The Yun family's abilities were exceptional, so this possibility could not be ruled out.</p><p></p><p>Ye Xiao had just broken through, and his inner powers were not yet under perfect control.</p><p></p><p>He had originally planned to use alchemy to further enhance his cultivation after the breakthrough, to see if the poisons from the Divine King's Tomb could push him to the second layer of the Deicide Realm.</p><p></p><p>Now, it seemed he should wait a few more days, until he had fully adapted to this level of cultivation before making his move.</p><p></p><p>Additionally, there was a small issue that needed to be resolved.</p><p></p><p>Ye Xiao gently cradled the Great Dragon in his hand, looking at the faint cracks on its body, his brow slightly furrowed with displeasure.</p><p></p><p>It seemed that along with the enhancement of his own strength, the Great Dragon's ability to withstand the output of spiritual energy had reached a critical point.</p><p></p><p>However, when one carefully calculated, the fact that it could reach this level and withstand Ye Xiao's Annihilation Arcane Art without shattering or exploding was already an excellent performance.</p><p></p><p>After all, many of the materials used to forge it in the past were now somewhat lagging behind Ye Xiao's pace.</p><p></p><p>It seemed that upon returning, he should reforge the Great Dragon.</p><p></p><p>Fortunately, he had obtained a lot of materials from the two Divine King's Tombs, which could be used to upgrade the Great Dragon.</p><p></p><p>At this moment, he vaguely sensed some auras rapidly converging in this direction.</p><p></p><p>Clearly, someone had noticed the celestial anomaly occurring in this remote place.</p><p></p><p>With a thought, Ye Xiao vanished from the spot.</p><p></p><p>Back on the ground, he had just started his workday.</p><p></p><p>Ye Xiao went to the library to read books, not directly upgrading the Great Dragon.</p><p></p><p>He currently only had the Forging Art and the Great Heavenly Contention Spirit, two divine-level forging techniques.</p><p></p><p>However, according to the display of the Golden Book's divine soul, Ye Xiao could use alchemy, forging, and cultivation methods to synthesize a brand-new Ancient Treasure Art.</p><p></p><p>And Ye Xiao was only missing the final cultivation method to complete this Ancient Treasure Art.</p><p></p><p>He wanted to wait until he had synthesized the Ancient Treasure Art before thinking about upgrading the Great Dragon.</p><p></p><p>Upgrading the Great Dragon's strength!</p><p></p><p>Two days later, in the starry sky, Ningjing Yuan and the others gathered again, their expressions solemn, as if waiting for something.</p><p></p><p>Soon, several large black dots appeared in the distance from the starry sky...</p><p></p><p>Here is the full English translation of the Chinese excerpt:</p><p></p><p>A light shone. "They're here."</p><p></p><p>Soon, several Lingwu ships quickly approached the group.</p><p></p><p>Ning Zhiyuan and the others immediately stepped forward and cupped their hands in greeting.</p><p></p><p>"Master Fu Long, Master Ye, Master Qin, welcome to this place!"</p><p></p><p>These were the top-ranking alchemists, forgers, and healers of the Xuanyuan Clan. They were not combat professions, and their cultivation levels were not even that high. For example, Master Fu Long had cultivated for thousands of years, but his cultivation was only at the Slaughter God Realm.</p><p></p><p>However, their status in the Xuanyuan Clan was supreme.</p><p></p><p>The reason was simple - in their respective support professions, they had reached the pinnacle of attainment! They could refine extremely powerful treasures and divine elixirs, and heal even the most severe injuries.</p><p></p><p>The few masters walked up and cupped their hands towards Ning Zhiyuan and the others, saying, "Young masters, you are too courteous."</p><p></p><p>Ning Zhiyuan and the others were the future pillars of the Xuanyuan Clan. Although they were still young and tender, their future accomplishments were limitless.</p><p></p><p>So these venerable elders, with their lofty status, were also quite tactful, not arrogantly accepting the greetings of Ning Zhiyuan and the others.</p><p></p><p>"This time, we have excavated a great many materials from the Ancient Divine Tomb, and they are still continuously increasing. </p><p></p><p>If we were to transport them all back to the Xuanyuan Clan's star domain, it would be extremely costly. So in the future, we will need you esteemed masters to refine them on-site, turning them into the necessary items, to facilitate our transportation."</p><p></p><p>The group nodded.</p><p></p><p>"We are also very interested in these Ancient materials. In the Ancient era, the martial dao civilization was prosperous, and many elixir formulas and forging methods have been lost for tens of thousands of years.</p><p></p><p>Now that we have come here, it is not only to serve the Xuanyuan Clan, but also to learn and improve our own skills."</p><p></p><p>"We have already prepared a welcome banquet below to reward you esteemed masters for your arduous journey by boat these past few days."</p><p></p><p>"Young masters are too kind." </p><p></p><p>"You esteemed masters are the treasures of our Xuanyuan Clan, of course we must treat you well. Please, after you."</p><p></p><p>"Young masters, please lead the way."</p><p></p><p>The group politely entered the human world.</p><p></p><p>On Ye Xiao's side, after searching for several consecutive days, he had finally gathered the last divine art-level cultivation method.</p><p></p><p>Originally, the Poison King's library had a divine art-level cultivation method, but it was of the same origin as the Nine Revolving Lotus Sutra, so Ye Xiao could not record it in his Golden Book Spiritual Sense.</p><p></p><p>Now that he had found this divine art-level cultivation method, it fulfilled the final requirement for synthesis, and he could proceed with the fusion.</p><p></p><p>As Ye Xiao's cultivation continuously rose, his spiritual sense had also undergone tremendous advancement.</p><p></p><p>The benefit of spiritual sense advancement was that the speed of cultivating techniques to the Great Perfection stage was accelerated, and the speed of fusion was also greatly increased.</p><p></p><p>Originally it would have taken several days to complete, but now Ye Xiao only needed around ten hours to finish the process.</p><p></p><p>From noon to around 10 PM, Ye Xiao cultivated the technique to Great Perfection and then fused it, producing a new Treasure Art.</p><p></p><p>After 10 PM, with a flash of golden light, a brand new Treasure Art appeared on the pages of the Golden Book - the Creation Treasure Art!</p><p></p><p>"Creation Treasure Art, it sounds incredibly powerful. Combining alchemy, forging, and cultivation methods, it actually synthesized such a Treasure Art.</p><p></p><p>It can refine and transform all things in heaven and earth, according to one's will, creating whatever one desires.</p><p></p><p>The specific creations are flexible and varied, based on one's cultivation level.</p><p></p><p>When the cultivation reaches a certain degree, one can even create something from nothing, transforming one existence into another.</p><p></p><p>The only limitation is that the creation cannot exceed one's current cultivation's bearing capacity.</p><p></p><p>So strong!"</p><p></p><p>Ye Xiao's eyes flickered. This meant that when his cultivation reached a certain realm, he could even change the very nature of matter, or even create new matter from nothing.</p><p></p><p>Truly, it was an Ancient Treasure Art, incredibly formidable.</p><p></p><p>Ye Xiao thought for a moment, then plucked a ordinary grass from the courtyard, not an immortal herb.</p><p></p><p>Afterwards, he activated the Creation Treasure Art, and that simple grass gradually transformed into a withered leaf, then back into a lush, vibrant grass in his hand.</p><p></p><p>Ye Xiao could achieve this same result using other methods as well.</p><p></p><p>For example, he could use spiritual energy to drain the vitality, dehydrate the chlorophyll, and then use the Immortality Treasure Art to heal it.</p><p></p><p>But that process involved attack and restoration. With the Creation Treasure Art, the transformation was a direct, single-step change of the essence of matter.</p><p></p><p>Ye Xiao pondered for a moment, then increased his spiritual energy output and used the Creation Treasure Art on the grass again.</p><p></p><p>This time, he wanted to transform the grass into something completely new.</p>

        <h1>Chapter 284</h1>
        <div class="content">
            <p>Here is the full English translation of the Chinese excerpt:</p><p></p><p>The changes in my inner cultivation were only because these dragon qi were circulating within my body, causing my dantian and meridians to have a part of their improvement, and thus I could absorb more spiritual energy power.</p><p></p><p>But as for breaking through, it was still the same as before, just lacking that last tiny bit.</p><p></p><p>It seems that breaking through to the Emperor Realm is not that easy after all.</p><p></p><p>Thinking about it carefully, it makes sense.</p><p></p><p>The Emperor Realm is the supreme existence in the human world.</p><p></p><p>If such a powerful being could be easily broken through by anyone, wouldn't that be a bit of a joke? Shaking his head, Ye Xiao entered meditation again, continuing to contemplate in the hopes of finding that final thread of opportunity.</p><p></p><p>And just a few days later, the phone in the director's office of the Jianghai City Martial Arts Library suddenly rang.</p><p></p><p>The Jiang Chen who answered the phone had his expression instantly freeze.</p><p></p><p>"Are they coming to demand accountability together? Do they really think the Nine Provinces are easy to bully?"</p><p></p><p>A tense voice came from the other end of the phone again.</p><p></p><p>"Master, what should we do? The other side is a full eleven King Realm experts from the West! They're waiting for a response at sea right now? If this matter can't be resolved peacefully, it will definitely be a disaster."</p><p></p><p>"I understand, you don't need to worry about this matter, continue to notify the other masters, the rest will be left to us."</p><p></p><p>"Understood."</p><p></p><p>Jiang Chen hung up the phone and called in Ouyang Yunzhong, who quickly walked in.</p><p></p><p>"Director! What did you summon me for?"</p><p></p><p>Jiang Chen spoke with a grave expression:</p><p></p><p>"I may have to leave Jianghai City for a while."</p><p></p><p>Ouyang Yunzhong's eyes flickered, with a hint of surprise.</p><p></p><p>"Yes, but I don't know how long the director will be away?"</p><p></p><p>"I don't know how long I'll be away either, maybe I'll be back tomorrow, or maybe I won't be able to come back for a long time.</p><p></p><p>If I'm not here, all the big and small affairs of the library will be handled by you.</p><p></p><p>I only have one request, whatever Ye Xiao requests, you must fulfill it all.</p><p></p><p>Remember, any request, you must fulfill it! Absolutely do not cause him any trouble, and do not ask any questions about him. Understand?"</p><p></p><p>"Understood."</p><p></p><p>Jiang Chen nodded.</p><p></p><p>"Alright, that's all, you can leave now."</p><p></p><p>"Yes."</p><p></p><p>Ouyang Yunzhong walked out, her heartbeat couldn't help but accelerate a bit.</p><p></p><p>"Strange, why did the director ask about Ye Xiao? The director's identity is definitely not ordinary. Although I don't know who he really is, his identity must be at the level of the Nine Provinces Alliance.</p><p></p><p>But why would he care so much about Ye Xiao. Could it be that Ye Xiao is my...!"</p><p></p><p>Ouyang Yunzhong's heart suddenly pounded violently.</p><p></p><p>She had always been curious about a question.</p><p></p><p>Why was Ye Xiao's temperament so calm, seemingly completely unlike an ordinary young man?</p><p></p><p>Although he didn't have the noble air of a young master from a prominent family, no matter what happened, he was always carefree and indifferent.</p><p></p><p>His temperament was terrifyingly strong.</p><p></p><p>In addition to that, every time there was a personnel change in the library, he just happened to be in a position that wouldn't be demoted.</p><p></p><p>The library required a post-heaven third-grade review, and he immediately broke through to post-heaven third-grade.</p><p></p><p>The library required a post-heaven fourth-grade review, and he immediately broke through to post-heaven sixth-grade.</p><p></p><p>And in the past year or so, there have been many big and small events happening in Jianghai City, but he has never been injured.</p><p></p><p>It's as if the spirit beasts would never hurt him.</p><p></p><p>This guy seems to not care about anything. But in reality, every step he takes is very stable.</p><p></p><p>Whether it's work or other matters.</p><p></p><p>Now she finally understood the problem.</p><p></p><p>Ye Xiao, he is the director's illegitimate son!</p><p></p><p>This also explains another thing, the director is already so old, but he was transferred from Jingzhou to Jianghai City to serve as the library director.</p><p></p><p>Isn't it just for his illegitimate son?</p><p></p><p>After figuring out this matter, Ouyang Yunzhong instantly felt a sense of joy.</p><p></p><p>It's a good thing that she has always been very nice to Ye Xiao, unknowingly she has already grasped a thick and powerful backing.</p><p></p><p>It seems that she will be blessed in the future.</p><p></p><p>Decided, in the future she must treat Ye Xiao even better.</p><p></p><p>Even find him a partner! No, find him ten partners, until he likes one of them!</p><p></p><p>Carry out the matchmaking to the end, tightly grasp the big thigh, absolutely cannot let him run away.</p><p></p><p>After Ouyang Yunzhong left, Jiang Chen took a deep breath and moved the bookshelf behind him.</p><p></p><p>Behind the bookshelf was a majestic and imposing wardrobe.</p><p></p><p>Inside the wardrobe was empty, except for a single robe. The robe was a dark green color, with a huge Xuanwu pattern embroidered on the back.</p><p></p><p>Jiang Chen gently stroked the robe, his eyes revealing a hint of glory and fighting spirit.</p><p></p><p>"Over fifty years! Old friend, today you will accompany me to the battlefield once again."</p><p></p><p>With that, he put on the robe, and the originally gentle old man instantly transformed into a fierce and mighty battle general!</p><p></p><p>With a thought, Jiang Chen instantly appeared in the sky.</p><p></p><p>Here is my translation of the Chinese excerpt:</p><p></p><p>One second, he paused.</p><p></p><p>Because, up in the sky, a figure had already been waiting here.</p><p></p><p>Sword Immortal Li Liushui!</p><p></p><p>"Li Liushui, what are you doing here?" </p><p></p><p>Jiang Chen spoke calmly.</p><p></p><p>Li Liushui's face was serious as he said:</p><p></p><p>"Venerable One, over the Western Seas, there are eleven extremely powerful auras, each one not weaker than a King Realm expert. What is going on?"</p><p></p><p>"This matter has nothing to do with you. You don't need to worry about it. You've just broken through to the King Realm, you should focus on meditation and consolidating your current cultivation."</p><p></p><p>Li Liushui spoke again:</p><p></p><p>"Venerable One, don't try to deceive me. I'm also a part of the Nine Realms, when something like this happens, there's no way I can just sit by and do nothing."</p><p></p><p>Jiang Chen stared intently at Li Liushui's stubborn gaze, somewhat helpless, but ultimately chose to be honest.</p><p></p><p>"It's because of Ye Xiao.</p><p></p><p>The two divine beasts that came a few days ago were the ones who had been plundering the dragon veins in the West for many days. Unfortunately, as soon as they arrived at Jianghai City, they were slain by a single sword strike from Ye Xiao, and those seventeen dragon veins all fell into Ye Xiao's hands.</p><p></p><p>Now, the eleven King Realm experts of the Western Alliance have gathered on the sea, they should be trying to take back the dragon veins."</p><p></p><p>Li Liushui snorted coldly.</p><p></p><p>"They actually have the nerve to come and demand it back. Something that they couldn't even protect, was taken by us in the Nine Realms, how could we possibly return it to them?"</p><p></p><p>"That's right. For nearly three hundred years, the various realms have repeatedly lured the star beasts towards the Nine Realms during calamities to alleviate the pressure, this account we haven't settled with them yet, how could we possibly return the dragon veins to them?</p><p></p><p>Moreover, the dragon veins have already been refined by Ye Xiao, Ye Xiao is currently in seclusion, he may have already almost finished refining them.</p><p></p><p>It's impossible to just kill Ye Xiao and take out the dragon veins, right?"</p><p></p><p>"Ye Xiao has done me a favor, and the Nine Realms is also my homeland. Both emotionally and rationally, I cannot remain uninvolved.</p><p></p><p>Venerable One, take me with you. Although I've just broken through to this realm, I'm still a King Realm expert. I should be able to be of some help."</p><p></p><p>The Venerable One was silent for a moment, then nodded.</p><p></p><p>Originally, he wanted to keep Li Liushui behind, after all, those were eleven King Realm experts, no one knew what might happen.</p><p></p><p>Li Liushui had just broken through. If a fierce battle were to break out, he would definitely be injured.</p><p></p><p>This would be very detrimental to his future cultivation.</p><p></p><p>Moreover, the beast calamity is about to arrive, he needs to preserve as many seeds for the Nine Realms as possible.</p><p></p><p>The Four Venerable Ones occupy the top two spots on the World Dragon Ranking and Phoenix Ranking, even if a fight breaks out, they would have a certain chance of defeating many with one.</p><p></p><p>He could bring out all the hidden cards of the Nine Realms.</p><p></p><p>But now, Li Liushui was determined to go, he understood that even if he wanted to stop him, he wouldn't be able to.</p><p></p><p>With his legs, he could reach the sea very quickly.</p><p></p><p>Rather than that, why bother stopping him?</p><p></p><p>But this is also good, let him experience the battle above the King Realm earlier, this is also a good thing for him.</p><p></p><p>As long as he chooses a suitable opponent for him, so that he won't get too injured, the problem won't be too big.</p><p></p><p>The two of them quickly transformed into two streams of light and disappeared from above Jianghai City.</p><p></p><p>On this side, in the next second after the two of them left, Ye Xiao had already awakened from his meditation.</p><p></p><p>Because he felt a familiar aura at the door of his courtyard.</p><p></p><p>This aura, he hadn't seen in a long time, but now it appeared again in the human realm.</p><p></p><p>"Junior Apprentice-sister Youwei, greets Senior Ye."</p><p></p><p>Creak~!</p><p></p><p>The door was opened, and it was none other than Huan Liuli.</p><p></p><p>Youwei was startled when she saw the exquisite cat girl Huan Liuli wearing a set of home clothes, stepping on cute jade-colored slippers, with her legs accentuated by black stockings.</p><p></p><p>Such powerful cultivation! She discovered that she couldn't see through the other party's cultivation at all.</p><p></p><p>This was too terrifying, after she returned, she had cultivated arduously, and in addition, the Silver Fox Clan had recently encountered some extraordinary events, so her strength had risen to the level of a Xiantian Sixth-Grade cultivator.</p><p></p><p>But even so, she still couldn't see through Huan Liuli's cultivation, so how strong was her cultivation? </p><p></p><p>Could it be that she had already advanced to the legendary Divine Ancestor realm?</p><p>And she was dressed so...so alluring, and appeared in Senior Ye's home, could it be that she was Senior Ye's woman?</p><p>Thinking of this, she hurriedly bowed and said, "Junior Apprentice-sister Youwei greets the Madam Ye."</p><p></p><p>Huan Liuli: "!"</p><p></p><p>Correct, this woman was very promising, she had very keen eyesight and immediately recognized Huan Liuli's true identity as Ye Xiao's wife!</p><p></p><p>This was very much to her liking.</p><p></p><p>"Well done, you are very smart to immediately recognize that I am Ye Xiao's wife."</p><p></p><p>Youwei wiped the cold sweat from her forehead, the corners of her mouth slightly raised.</p><p></p><p>So she was indeed Master Ye's woman, it's a good thing she was so perceptive, otherwise it would have been so embarrassing? Now that she had won over the favor of Madam Ye, naturally she would be able to smoothly complete her mission.</p><p></p><p>Perfect!</p><p></p><p>"Madam Ye, this junior has an important matter to request of you, please inform Master Ye for me."</p>

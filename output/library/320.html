        <h1>Chapter 320</h1>
        <div class="content">
            <p>Here is the full English translation of the Chinese excerpt:</p><p></p><p>The ferocious raptor of the Superhuman Realm couldn't help but shudder violently, with a terrified look in its eyes.</p><p></p><p>"Young... Young Master, please do not be angry. We have done our utmost to deal with the descendants of the Xuanyuan Clan. Aside from the Nine Prefectures of the Human Realm, we have already captured all the humans in other regions such as the Yingzhou, Hanzhou, and Yuezhou Prefectures. They are all descendants of the Nine Prefectures, and have weak Xuanyuan Clan divine blood within them.</p><p></p><p>The only difference is that their numbers are not as many as those in the Nine Prefectures, and their quality is not as pure. </p><p></p><p>However, their numbers are still substantial, and we are working hard to refine them.</p><p></p><p>Once the refinement is complete, I will immediately bring them to the Young Master!"</p><p></p><p>"That's not necessary. That tiny bit of divine blood is useless even if we have it. You should use that divine blood to create more Superhuman Star Beasts, and completely annihilate the humans of the Nine Prefectures. Refine their divine blood and then bring it to me."</p><p></p><p>"As you wish!"</p><p></p><p>The ferocious raptor of the Superhuman Realm transformed into a beam of light and flew towards the Human Realm.</p><p></p><p>The figure in black clothes let out a cold snort.</p><p></p><p>"I never expected the descendants of the Xuanyuan Clan to be so troublesome.</p><p></p><p>It's a pity I can't go there myself, or else if I'm discovered and they get hold of evidence, it would be a capital offense!"</p><p></p><p>At this moment, the jade ring on his finger flickered twice, emitting two faint green lights.</p><p></p><p>Simultaneously, a voice was transmitted to his mind through spiritual power.</p><p></p><p>"Chener, do not be anxious. Remember, haste makes waste. </p><p></p><p>With your master here, I can absolutely guarantee that you will obtain the divine blood of those Xuanyuan Clan descendants, and assist you in breaking through to the Divine Realm."</p><p></p><p>Hearing this, the black figure's gaze immediately softened.</p><p></p><p>He gently caressed the jade ring on his hand and softly said, "Yes, Master. Your disciple will heed your teachings."</p><p></p><p>...</p><p></p><p>On the other side, Ye Xiao sat down cross-legged in front of the Imperial Stele, and his consciousness sank into the Stele.</p><p></p><p>The materials used to construct this Imperial Stele were extremely special, and only a consciousness at the Imperial Realm and above could enter it.</p><p></p><p>Apart from that, no cultivation base could affect the Imperial Stele, let alone enter its interior.</p><p></p><p>No wonder the Nine Prefectures Alliance placed it here without any worries.</p><p></p><p>Although it was just the interior of a stone stele, it was actually immensely vast inside.</p><p></p><p>When Ye Xiao arrived, he felt as if he had entered a boundless starry sky.</p><p></p><p>But soon, a bright spot appeared in the distance, then a second, a third, a fourth... These bright spots gathered quickly towards him, like stars, and converged around Ye Xiao.</p><p></p><p>The bright spots grew brighter and brighter, and when they reached Ye Xiao, he realized they were illusory figures!</p><p></p><p>Some wore imperial robes, some wore armor, their sizes and shapes varied - some were seven feet tall and burly, some were tall and slender, and some were short and stout.</p><p></p><p>But they all shared one common trait - they had yellow skin and black eyes!</p><p></p><p>"Ah, a new arrival!"</p><p>"Another one has died?"</p><p>"I've never seen this young man before. When I died, there were only Emperor Jing and Emperor Yun left, but not him. Seeing such a young person die is such a waste."</p><p></p><p>Ye Xiao: "(￣.￣)!"</p><p></p><p>After a moment, someone finally noticed Ye Xiao's difference.</p><p></p><p>"Wait, he hasn't died! He's just merged his consciousness into the Imperial Stele while still alive."</p><p></p><p>"Whoa, really? I thought he was another one I could play chess with."</p><p></p><p>Ye Xiao was silent for a while before finally speaking:</p><p></p><p>"Junior Ye Xiao pays respects to the esteemed predecessors."</p><p></p><p>He was slightly polite, after all these were the predecessors who had perished for the sake of the Nine Prefectures. </p><p></p><p>But he did not bow deeply, remaining calm and composed as he looked at the crowd.</p><p></p><p>"Ye Xiao? I've never heard of any Great Emperor with the surname Ye in history!"</p><p></p><p>"Could this young man be a new Imperial Realm cultivator? Incredible! The dragon veins have already been severed, and the spiritual energy in the Nine Prefectures is diluted many times over, yet he was still able to break through."</p><p></p><p>"Young man, what era is it now? How are the Star Beasts outside? How are the humans doing?"</p><p></p><p>Amidst the cacophony of voices, Ye Xiao finally heard a relatively normal question.</p><p></p><p>He cleared his throat and then spoke:</p><p></p><p>"I have come here this time precisely for this matter. Now it is the Nine Prefectures Alliance in power, with no more distinctions between dynasties. However, the Nine Prefectures Alliance will soon be no more."</p><p></p><p>The expressions of the Imperial Realm experts suddenly changed, staring intently at Ye Xiao.</p><p></p><p>"What do you mean by that?"</p><p></p><p>Ye Xiao spoke again:</p><p></p><p>"The Star Beasts have already destroyed all the other Prefectures except the Nine Prefectures. Now only the Nine Prefectures remain, and once they refine the divine blood of the other human tribes, cultivate more Superhuman Star Beasts, they will likely begin their attack on the human tribes of the Nine Prefectures."</p><p></p><p>The former emperors' gazes suddenly sharpened.</p><p></p><p>"It has reached such a dire state?"</p><p></p><p>"Unbelievable that after a thousand years, the Star Beasts have grown so arrogant. In our time, we could pierce through the starry sky and suppress the Star Beasts until they couldn't even raise their heads."</p><p></p><p>"The Nine Prefectures are now in imminent danger. I have come here to understand if you esteemed predecessors have any way to save them."</p><p></p><p>Here is the full English translation of the Chinese excerpt:</p><p></p><p>"The Nine Realms?" </p><p></p><p>The majestic spirits of the emperors did not show any excessive excitement on their faces, they just looked at Ye Xiao calmly. One of them, whose face looked a bit like a shoehorn, spoke up:</p><p></p><p>"Young man, if you've come to ask about this, then forget it. We are all dead people now, and according to the rules, we should not get involved in the affairs of the living."</p><p></p><p>"Yes! We have fought for the Nine Realms our entire lives, exhausted all our efforts, and only barely earned the qualification to reside in this Immortal Stele. </p><p></p><p>Now that we are just spiritual bodies, what else can we do for the Nine Realms? Let us rest."</p><p></p><p>Ye Xiao fell silent. They were all right. Each and every one of them had made extremely deep contributions to the Nine Realms. It was because of their defense of the Nine Realms that Ye Xiao's own body was able to come into existence and allow him to cross over here. </p><p></p><p>Otherwise, he might not have been able to come to this world at all.</p><p></p><p>Thinking about this, he cupped his hands and said, "Apologies, junior has disturbed you. However, junior still dares to request that you venerable seniors speak up and tell me, is there any hope to restore the Dragon Veins?"</p><p></p><p>"What do you want to restore the Dragon Veins for?"</p><p></p><p>"Junior wishes to reactivate the Myriad Miles Great Formation left behind by the Ancestor Emperor Xuan Long!"</p><p></p><p>The imperial spirits chuckled.</p><p></p><p>"Even if you reactivate the Myriad Miles Great Formation, what use would it be? The Myriad Miles Great Formation can seal the Nine Realms, but it still has a loophole, which is the gate of the Nine Realms.</p><p></p><p>If no one can guard the gate, then even if you restore the Myriad Miles Great Formation, it would be a waste of effort."</p><p></p><p>"The reason why Ancestor Emperor Xuan Long established the Myriad Miles Great Formation was because the Great Qin had outstanding talents, with a gathering of powerful experts at the Emperor Realm.</p><p></p><p>So it was easy for them to guard the gate and prevent the Star Beasts from invading. </p><p></p><p>But now, the human race has declined to this extent, there is no one who can guard the gate, no matter how hard you try, it would be futile."</p><p></p><p>"Moreover, the severing of the Dragon Veins was precisely because no one could suppress them, the Dragon Veins have already formed their own consciousness and want to leave the human race and establish their own path.</p><p></p><p>If you restore the Dragon Veins again, if there is no existence powerful enough to subdue them, the Dragon Veins will still flee, what's the use?"</p><p></p><p>"Young man, don't daydream. Adding you, Cloud Emperor, and Jing Emperor, the human race of the Nine Realms only has three at the Emperor Realm. Three Emperor Realm experts are no match for the army of Star Beasts."</p><p></p><p>The interest of the imperial spirits was obviously not high. </p><p></p><p>This was also very normal, each of them had once exhausted their last drop of blood for the Nine Realms, had once risked everything for the Nine Realms.</p><p></p><p>They had made contributions, and they had no regrets about the Nine Realms.</p><p></p><p>So now, they could comfortably, and they were fully qualified, to comment on Ye Xiao's ideas from an outsider's perspective.</p><p></p><p>However, Ye Xiao heard the implication in the words of the group.</p><p></p><p>That is, they had the ability to restore the Dragon Veins.</p><p></p><p>After taking a deep breath, Ye Xiao spoke up again:</p><p></p><p>"I will guard the gate!"</p><p></p><p>This simple sentence was filled with firm determination.</p><p></p><p>The imperial spirits were slightly taken aback, but someone soon reacted.</p><p></p><p>"You say you'll guard the gate, what are you basing that on? I can see that you are just a young man who has just entered the Emperor Realm. With your cultivation, to be blunt, going up there would be suicide, you won't be able to withstand the army of Star Beasts. We won't make such a meaningless sacrifice."</p><p></p><p>Ye Xiao's expression was grave, and his attitude was resolute. "I am very strong! Not only is my strength, but my talent is also very strong. So I can single-handedly guard the gate."</p><p></p><p>The imperial spirits smiled.</p><p></p><p>"Young man, you don't think we can't see through you, do you? Although you are 21 years old and have already broken through to the Emperor Realm expert, you may have been enlightened by the Dihui. </p><p></p><p>We here are all true Emperor Realm experts who have cultivated on our own! You don't even rank among us."</p><p></p><p>"And what if I cultivated it myself? And I only took a little over a year to reach this realm?"</p><p></p><p>As soon as these words were said, the entire scene fell completely silent, the imperial spirits staring at Ye Xiao as if they had seen a ghost, their faces filled with disbelief.</p><p></p><p>"What did you just say?"</p><p></p><p>One of the Emperor Realm spirits was suddenly shocked, looking at Ye Xiao with utter incredulity.</p><p></p><p>Ye Xiao spoke up again:</p><p></p><p>"My current cultivation level, in fact, took me at most a year and a half to achieve.</p><p></p><p>So as long as you venerable seniors can help me restore the Dragon Veins, I, Ye Xiao, will definitely protect the Nine Realms!"</p><p></p><p>The Emperor Realm spirits, hearing Ye Xiao's confirmation, were all stunned, their souls seemingly shocked and their whole bodies numb, unable to speak for a while.</p><p></p><p>An Emperor Realm in a year and a half! How did this young man do it? "Young man, tell the truth, did you have someone enlighten you with the Dihui?"</p>

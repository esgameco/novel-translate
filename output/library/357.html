        <h1>Chapter 357</h1>
        <div class="content">
            <p>Here is the full English translation of the Chinese excerpt:</p><p></p><p>"Young Master Ning, you are from the mighty Xuanyuan Clan. How dare you bully us like this?" </p><p></p><p>Katomeir spoke up again, angrily questioning.</p><p></p><p>But the response he received was another bombardment.</p><p></p><p>Boom! Powerful cannon fire grazed past him, instantly destroying another spiritual energy ship.</p><p></p><p>"The actions of my Xuanyuan Clan need no explanation to you.</p><p></p><p>I'll give you ten breaths. If you don't retreat, I'll consider it a challenge to my Xuanyuan Clan, and don't blame me for going to war directly."</p><p></p><p>Katomeir's face twitched uncontrollably, dark and gloomy, almost dripping with water.</p><p>He wished he could just go up and tear the other party apart, swallowing him alive.</p><p></p><p>But he knew he couldn't do it. </p><p>Not only was his strength not enough, the clan behind them was simply not qualified to contend with the Xuanyuan Clan.</p><p>The gap between the two sides was too great. If they really fought, they would be completely wiped out on their side.</p><p>That would be truly disastrous.</p><p></p><p>So after taking a deep breath, he could only grit his teeth and say angrily, "Let's go!"</p><p></p><p>The forces of the Three Clans, no matter how unwilling, had to retreat.</p><p></p><p>Meikang caught up and whispered in Katomeir's ear, "Senior, are we just admitting defeat like this? Let them station here, with the strength of the Xuanyuan Clan, who knows how many divine tombs they'll plunder. This is too much of a loss for us."</p><p></p><p>Katomeir said gloomily:</p><p>"Then what else can we do? Go fight them head-on? If you can go, I'll fully support you. But I'm not going."</p><p></p><p>Meikang: "Tsk!"</p><p></p><p>He paused for a moment, then quickly apologized with a smile:</p><p>"Senior, you're not joking with me, are you? I don't have that kind of strength."</p><p></p><p>"Hmph! You know that in your heart."</p><p></p><p>"Then what do we do now?"</p><p></p><p>"What else can we do? Hurry up and look for other divine tombs, try to dig more divine tombs before they do, and minimize the losses as much as possible."</p><p></p><p>"Yes!"</p><p></p><p>On the Xuanyuan Clan side, Leidong Tian and the others flew up, cupping their hands and bowing to Ning Zhiyuan.</p><p></p><p>"Thank you, Young Master Ning, for your timely assistance. If it weren't for your help, we would have been in serious trouble today."</p><p></p><p>Ning Zhiyuan smiled slightly.</p><p></p><p>"Mr. Lei is too polite. We are all from the Xuanyuan Clan, so we should naturally help and support each other.</p><p>Moreover, I was also ordered to come and assist you."</p><p></p><p>"Haha, well, we must thank Young Master Ning for your assistance today."</p><p></p><p>"No need to be so formal, Mr. Lei. Why don't you tell me more about the situation here?"</p><p></p><p>"Yes! In this star field, divine tombs have been excavated for some reason. At first, we thought they might just be the tomb remnants of some injured and fallen ancient gods, but we soon realized that was not the case.</p><p>Because more and more divine tombs have been discovered here. Currently on our side, we have already found more than fifty divine tombs, including two Slaughter God Realm tombs.</p><p>And this is just on our side, the discoveries of the other Three Clans have not been included yet."</p><p></p><p>Ning Zhiyuan frowned and said:</p><p></p><p>"Normally, such a concentrated area of divine tombs means this place was likely an ancient sect or a battlefield in the ancient times.</p><p>If that's the case, there may be even more divine tombs here, not just these.</p><p>Alright, I'll have my people start participating in the excavation as well. But you all will guard the front against the Three Clans, while we'll be behind you, in case there are any conflicts or traps laid by the other side.</p><p>Additionally, the divine tombs we excavate will also be transferred to you, to make up for the losses you may suffer in the back not finding any tombs."</p><p></p><p>"Good, thank you very much, Young Master Ning."</p><p></p><p>Ning Zhiyuan nodded, then instructed the warriors of the Ning Mansion to start participating in the excavation.</p><p>Then he spoke to Leidong Tian again:</p><p></p><p>"Mr. Lei, while we have this free time, I'd like to ask you about something."</p><p></p><p>Leidong Tian nodded.</p><p>"Young Master Ning, please go ahead. I will report in detail on anything I know."</p><p></p><p>Ning Zhiyuan then spoke:</p><p></p><p>"On my way here, I encountered a super genius who broke through to the God Realm. When he broke through, the highest level purple lightning tribulation appeared in the starry sky, and he also had a heavenly phenomenon, attracting the worship of ancient heroes.</p><p>Moreover, he is also a member of the Xuanyuan Clan! A divine dragon of the Xuanyuan Clan appeared when he broke through."</p><p></p><p>"What? Young Master Ning, you must not be joking with me, right?" </p><p></p><p>Leidong Tian heard Ning Zhiyuan's words and was immediately shocked and dumbfounded! He could hardly imagine what he had just heard.</p><p>In his entire life, he had only seen such things in books, and had never witnessed them with his own eyes before.</p><p>In his world, those things were as unimaginable as ordinary people thinking gods do not exist.</p><p>Yet now, Ning Zhiyuan was telling him that such a person existed in this world.</p><p>How could he not be shocked?</p><p></p><p>"I'm not joking with you."</p><p></p><p>Ning Zhiyuan spoke again, his face serious:</p><p></p><p>"I want to ask you, is there any genius from our Xuanyuan Clan who has appeared around here? For example, from the main family or someone on the Genius Rankings?"</p><p></p><p>Here is the full English translation of the Chinese excerpt:</p><p></p><p>Leidong Tian shook his head.</p><p></p><p>"Young Master Ning, if you're asking me about this, then you're asking the wrong person.</p><p></p><p>Not only have they not shown up, even if they did, there's no way I could know their identities!</p><p></p><p>And even if they came, they definitely wouldn't come looking for someone like me, right?"</p><p></p><p>Ning Zhiyuan fell silent. What Leidong Tian said was correct.</p><p></p><p>On the Xuanyuan Prodigy List, each and every one was a young genius with lofty aspirations, otherwise they wouldn't have been labeled as prodigies! People of that caliber definitely wouldn't casually come to this remote place.</p><p></p><p>But if it wasn't them, then who could it be?</p><p></p><p>Leidong Tian pondered for a moment, then suddenly exclaimed:</p><p></p><p>"Could it be him?"</p><p></p><p>But he quickly shook his head.</p><p></p><p>"But that doesn't make sense. Although he is extremely monstrous, he was born in this remote place, there's no way he could surpass the existences on the Xuanyuan Prodigy List, right?"</p><p></p><p>Ning Zhiyuan's brow furrowed slightly.</p><p></p><p>"Who are you talking about?"</p><p></p><p>"Oh, it's like this. In this human world, there was previously a star beast attack, and there was an extremely special strong person who saved this world. </p><p></p><p>If he hadn't intervened, this world would have been destroyed long ago.</p><p></p><p>This world has many legends about him, and the people of this world call him the Sword Immortal.</p><p></p><p>But it shouldn't be him, he hasn't even dared to reveal his identity till now, his talent definitely couldn't have reached that level of heaven-defying."</p><p></p><p>Ning Zhiyuan's eyes turned thoughtful.</p><p></p><p>"The Sword Immortal, huh? It seems this young master should go take a look in the Nine States."</p><p></p><p>On the other side, Ye Xiao had already returned to his own doorstep.</p><p></p><p>His Yin-Yang Escape Technique's speed was already mind-bogglingly fast to begin with. </p><p></p><p>Now, with his advancement to the Divine Realm, his speed had increased exponentially compared to before.</p><p></p><p>The speed of the Spiritual Energy Warship was no match for him, slowing down by several times.</p><p></p><p>Ye Xiao clenched his fists, feeling the surging power within him, his mood significantly improved.</p><p></p><p>Increased strength was great, every time his strength grew, he felt his entire body brimming with power, with endless energy.</p><p></p><p>Of course, there was another benefit - his mind had also developed further, becoming even more lucid.</p><p></p><p>It was like expanding the storage capacity of a memory card, allowing it to accommodate many things that couldn't fit before, without any lag.</p><p></p><p>He let out a long sigh. Right now, just after his breakthrough, his spiritual energy was still continuously rising, and because it was too powerful, it would take a while before he could conceal it.</p><p></p><p>Spiritual energy surrounded him, forming a dense mist that soaked his clothes, clinging tightly to his body and revealing his muscular physique.</p><p></p><p>Some female passersby couldn't help but steal glances.</p><p></p><p>Their cultivation was not high, so even though Ye Xiao didn't conceal his cultivation, they couldn't see through it. </p><p></p><p>But the problem was, while they couldn't see through his cultivation, they could still clearly see how good-looking he was and how great his physique was.</p><p></p><p>Ye Xiao was quite speechless, and could only quickly walk into the house.</p><p></p><p>Even so, his breathing was now quite troublesome.</p><p></p><p>Because his power was so strong now, when he breathed, the abundant spiritual energy felt like two strange elongated objects going in and out of his nostrils - in and out, in and out. This sensation was quite annoying for Ye Xiao.</p><p></p><p>It seemed it would take two days for him to get used to it.</p><p></p><p>However, Ye Xiao was now more excited than disappointed.</p><p></p><p>He had finally successfully broken through to the Divine Realm.</p><p></p><p>After reaching this cultivation level, he had also completely fused with his divine soul.</p><p></p><p>This also allowed him to fully understand how to use the Golden Book.</p><p></p><p>In fact, the divine soul is a manifestation of a person's innate nature, it is a virtual material that everyone is born with.</p><p></p><p>It will only take a concrete form under the strong will of the individual.</p><p></p><p>It's a bit complicated to explain, but overall, whether this thing appears and how powerful it is, ultimately depends on the depth and strength of the person's inner self.</p><p></p><p>Everyone has it, but only those who cultivate to the Divine Realm have a chance to control it.</p><p></p><p>But its power and weakness cannot be mastered by everyone.</p><p></p><p>The Golden Book can now continue to synthesize even higher-level Ancient Treasures.</p><p></p><p>However, according to Ye Xiao's previous plan, among the divine arts he currently possessed, the same category already included the Sword Dao Opening the Heavens and Splitting the Earth.</p><p></p><p>According to normal logic, Ye Xiao should already be able to fuse out an Ancient Treasure.</p><p></p><p>But it had not succeeded.</p><p></p><p>On the Golden Book, there are currently two major factions that have begun to faintly emit a golden light, indicating that these techniques are about to be able to synthesize two Ancient Treasures.</p><p></p><p>One is the combination of the Sword Dao Opening the Heavens, Splitting the Earth Sword, and the Burying God Saber.</p><p></p><p>A Saber Technique and Sword Technique fusing into an Ancient Treasure?

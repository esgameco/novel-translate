        <h1>Chapter 353</h1>
        <div class="content">
            <p>Here is the full English translation of the Chinese excerpt:</p><p></p><p>Ye Xiao originally wanted to go to the black market or find a company to buy it, but as soon as he walked out of the library, he saw a familiar face printed on the advertisement space under the road sign, with the contact information of the Yinian Stone.</p><p></p><p>The corners of his mouth slightly raised, Ye Xiao dialed the other party's number.</p><p></p><p>"Hello! This is Jianghai Wang's Company, I am the general manager Wang Daiong, how can I help you?"</p><p></p><p>"Old Wang, it's me."</p><p></p><p>"Oh, President Ye, long time no see, where have you been making money these two years?"</p><p></p><p>"I can't say I'm making money, I've just been making some friends out there. Now, some friends want me to help them collect some spirit crystals, so I thought of you, Mr. Wang."</p><p></p><p>"President Ye still cares about me, no wonder I like doing business with you."</p><p></p><p>"Enough chit-chat. Give me a price."</p><p></p><p>"Hmm, the current market exchange rate between spirit crystals and spirit stones is 1:220, but considering our relationship, I'll give you 1:201."</p><p></p><p>"I need a large quantity."</p><p></p><p>"How much?"</p><p></p><p>"As much as you can provide. Even if you give me a million spirit crystals, I'll take them."</p><p></p><p>In Ye Xiao's storage ring, he had a large number of spirit stones that he had seized from the Beast God Alliance a long time ago.</p><p></p><p>Using them to exchange for spirit crystals would be perfect.</p><p></p><p>Moreover, in the future, he must convert them all into spirit crystals, because after entering the spirit crystal realm, the spirit crystals can also help him improve his cultivation.</p><p></p><p>"Why do you need so many?"</p><p></p><p>"What, can't you get them?"</p><p></p><p>"I can, it's just a bit troublesome. But since President Ye wants them, I'll get them for you no matter what."</p><p></p><p>"Good! If you help me this time, I'll continue to come to you for exchange in the future."</p><p></p><p>"Okay, okay, since President Ye says so, I'll give you another 10 off, 1:200. Is this price acceptable?"</p><p></p><p>"Okay, but I need you to keep my identity a secret. Can you do that?"</p><p></p><p>"Don't worry, I can definitely do that. I'll split the transaction into multiple orders, unless the other party scans my spiritual power, no one will know about this."</p><p></p><p>Ye Xiao nodded.</p><p></p><p>"Then help me collect them, the sooner the better. I'm in a hurry to use them."</p><p></p><p>"Alright, within three days, I guarantee they'll be in your hands."</p><p></p><p>After hanging up the communication with the Yinian Stone, Ye Xiao started walking towards home.</p><p></p><p>Since Wang Daiong said it would take three days, he would wait three more days.</p><p></p><p>After three days, he would definitely go to the starry sky above and find a place where no one was, to break through and become a god! As for Wang Daiong's spiritual power, at that time, he would personally use his spiritual power to modify it, so that no one would find out.</p><p></p><p>The ancestors had said a lot, his divine soul and divine eyes were now extremely precious and supreme treasures. If they were leaked out, he didn't know how many people would covet them. If it attracted some divine kings or divine emperors, wouldn't he be dead?</p><p></p><p>In the next three days, everything became very calm.</p><p></p><p>Except for many high-level experts from the divine sects who signed up to dig the tombs in the starry sky, there was no other unusual activity. Even the Xuanyuan clan members guarding the ground were unable to resist the urge to go to the starry sky.</p><p></p><p>The ground was more relaxed than ever before, and Ye Xiao even felt that he didn't need to hide his aura anymore.</p><p></p><p>Apparently, all the major divine clans were starting to summon their clansmen behind them, gathering more clansmen to compete for the divine tombs.</p><p></p><p>This made Ye Xiao even more eager to break through to the divine realm as soon as possible!</p><p></p><p>Finally, three days later, Wang Daiong called Ye Xiao to come and get the spirit crystals.</p><p></p><p>"President Ye, the spirit crystals are ready. But you'll have to come and get them yourself, there's too much to send. If I bring people, it will expose your identity."</p><p></p><p>"I understand, I'll be right there."</p><p></p><p>Ye Xiao hung up the phone, took a deep breath, and was finally about to start his advancement.</p><p></p><p>He quickly arrived at Wang Daiong's company.</p><p></p><p>This was the company that Wang Daiong and a few others like Old Xu had jointly opened, and Ye Xiao had been there two years ago, but the building wasn't as tall as it was now.</p><p></p><p>Looks like they've made some money.</p><p></p><p>Ye Xiao directly followed Wang Daiong's reminder and went upstairs.</p><p></p><p>What surprised him was that Xu Dacat was actually the secretary in front of Wang Daiong's office.</p><p></p><p>Those five delicate beauties were wearing OL work uniforms, and the black stockings on their legs were almost bursting, the thin heels of the high heels made Ye Xiao extremely doubtful whether they could support Xu Dacat's weight.</p><p></p><p>From this moment on, Ye Xiao felt that he had a bad impression of certain areas!</p><p></p><p>"What are you doing as a secretary here?"</p><p></p><p>Xu Dacat glanced at Ye Xiao.</p><p></p><p>"My dad arranged for me to be here, he said it's not civilized for a girl to be running around delivering goods all the time, so he had me be a secretary here, so I can be more ladylike.</p><p></p><p>And now Wang Daiong is our executive manager, so I can also protect his safety here."</p><p></p><p>Ye Xiao: "(_..)!"</p><p></p><p>"I'm here to take care of some business with him."</p><p></p><p>"Do you have an appointment?"</p><p></p><p>"He told me to come."</p><p></p><p>"Then go on in."</p><p></p><p>Here is the full English translation of the Chinese excerpt:</p><p></p><p>Cat Xu pushed open the door, and Ye Xiao walked in from under her arm. To be honest, with Cat Xu guarding the entrance, regardless of her cultivation level, just her physique alone made one feel a sense of security.</p><p></p><p>"President Ye has arrived, please come in, come in." </p><p></p><p>Wang Dalong invited Ye Xiao in and apologetically said, "President Ye, I'm sorry to have you come all this way. But there's no other way, the items you requested are just too many, and there's a risk in taking them out.</p><p></p><p>Our company is a joint venture, and I can't afford the losses. I hope you can understand."</p><p></p><p>He quickly poured a cup of tea for Ye Xiao.</p><p></p><p>"Where are the items?"</p><p></p><p>"Right here, please take a look."</p><p></p><p>Wang Dalong then handed Ye Xiao a storage ring.</p><p></p><p>"This storage ring is a gift for you, for your convenience."</p><p></p><p>Storage rings used to be extremely valuable items, but with the communication between the human world and the Xuanyuan Clan, many had been transported over, making them rather common.</p><p></p><p>Ye Xiao took the storage ring, glanced at it, and sure enough, a hundred million spirit crystals were lying motionless inside.</p><p></p><p>Ye Xiao nodded, then handed the spirit stones to Wang Dalong.</p><p></p><p>A total of four billion spirit stones, and after Wang Dalong verified them, his smile grew even brighter.</p><p></p><p>"Doing business with President Ye is always so smooth. Tonight I've reserved a table at Xinghua Pavilion, President Ye must grace us with your presence."</p><p></p><p>"That won't be necessary, I have other matters to attend to today. I'll invite you another time when I'm free. I'll be leaving now."</p><p></p><p>"President Ye is leaving so soon? That's too bad. Let me see you off."</p><p></p><p>"No need, I can find my own way out."</p><p></p><p>"Let me at least see you to the door."</p><p></p><p>Wang Dalong personally saw Ye Xiao to the main entrance. After Ye Xiao left, he felt a slight fluctuation in the Golden Book Spiritual Consciousness within him.</p><p></p><p>He couldn't help but raise the corner of his mouth in a slight smile.</p><p></p><p>Because this meant that the Golden Book Spiritual Consciousness had fully integrated the formation, forming the divine art-level formation he needed.</p><p></p><p>Immersed in his thoughts, Ye Xiao swept a glance around, and the formation had already taken shape - the Magnificent Violet Spirit Formation! This formation not only possessed the characteristics of the previous Earth Oppressing Heaven Opposing Formation, Brilliant Pearl Emperor Formation, and Grand Heavenly Vast Origin Formation, but it would also further amplify their power.</p><p></p><p>It could also continuously adjust the formation's power based on its own consciousness, which could effectively prevent enemies from breaking the formation.</p><p></p><p>Normally, the power of a formation is fixed from the moment it is created. As long as one can find the rules within, they can break it.</p><p></p><p>But once a formation has its own consciousness, it's different. It can constantly change its operation trajectory and routes, as well as the power of certain isolated areas.</p><p></p><p>Not only that, after mastering it, Ye Xiao's understanding of formations would deepen further. In the future, if he encountered other formations, he would easily find their weaknesses and break them.</p><p></p><p>This could be considered another powerful weapon for Ye Xiao.</p><p></p><p>However, this was not the most important thing for Ye Xiao.</p><p></p><p>The most important thing was that he had completed all his preparations, and now it was time to find a hidden place to break through.</p><p></p><p>Ye Xiao sent a message to his colleague at the library, saying he would be away for a few days to handle some matters, then vanished from the surface world.</p><p></p><p>His ancestor had said that because his spiritual consciousness and physique were so strong, this breakthrough would definitely cause a huge commotion, so he must be careful and not do it on the surface, but in the starry sky, find a place with no one around.</p><p></p><p>As soon as he arrived in the starry sky, Ye Xiao's spiritual sense swept across the distance, detecting many Emperor Realm cultivators in battle, their terrifying auras constantly surging outward. This made Ye Xiao's brows furrow slightly.</p><p></p><p>"It seems that as more and more divine tombs are excavated, the battles between the major clans will become more and more intense. Could this trigger a new war?"</p><p></p><p>But he soon shook his head.</p><p></p><p>Because even if a new war broke out, this time the Xuanyuan Clan was in an absolute advantage. As the 19th ranked race in the starry sky, they were not like the humans facing the Star Beasts, where only the Xuanyuan Clan could kill others, but not the other way around.</p><p></p><p>This war had nothing to do with Ye Xiao.</p><p></p><p>Relying on his extremely powerful movement technique - the Yin-Yang Evasion Art, Ye Xiao quickly found a quiet place - a meteor cluster.</p><p></p><p>This place was desolate, without a single bird or feather, not a trace of vitality.</p><p></p><p>Ye Xiao began to set up the formation first.</p><p></p><p>The formation was the foundation for the breakthrough, and it would provide him with some energy and protection during the breakthrough.</p><p></p><p>The Magnificent Violet Spirit Formation was soon set up, and a layer of thunderclouds had already begun to gather in the sky above - the thunder tribulation clouds specifically formed for the divine formation.</p><p></p><p>But he did not directly activate it, so the thunder tribulation in the clouds could not descend.</p><p></p><p>Ye Xiao's idea was simple - when the breakthrough happened, he would then manifest the formation to help him resist it.</p><p></p><p>Then, he began to refine a dan.</p><p></p><p>Two more updates, six thousand words.</p><p></p><p>Seeking recommendations, seeking monthly votes.</p><p></p><p>Thank you to the reader Sea Without Four Seasons for the reward, greatly appreciated.</p><p></p><p>(This chapter is complete)</p>

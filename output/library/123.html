        <h1>Chapter 123</h1>
        <div class="content">
            <p>Here is the full English translation of the Chinese excerpt:</p><p></p><p>In terms of spiritual power cultivation techniques, there was the Taixuan Tiangong. </p><p></p><p>For protective techniques, there was the Indestructible Divine Skill, as well as a set of imperial armor - the Black Scaled Armor.</p><p></p><p>For spiritual energy replenishment, there was the Purple Thorn Star Sea Heart Technique.</p><p></p><p>For weapon forging, there was the Ghostly Craftsmanship, and for pill refining, there was the Myriad Elements Converge as One.</p><p></p><p>There was also an extremely powerful divine intent technique that was great for both chasing and escaping.</p><p></p><p>For healing techniques, there were the Supplementing the Heavens Technique and the Dawn Star Technique.</p><p></p><p>And in addition, there was the Heaven-Spanning Cosmic Array formation.</p><p></p><p>Furthermore, his cultivation had already reached the peak of the Primordial Sixth Realm, the pinnacle of the Great Grandmaster, just one step away from breaking through to the Divine Monarch Realm.</p><p></p><p>Wow, without even realizing it, he had accumulated so many techniques.</p><p></p><p>Ye Xiao felt deeply gratified.</p><p></p><p>It had been over a year since he arrived in this world, and his current achievements were still within his satisfactory range.</p><p></p><p>It was not in vain that he had been diligently and earnestly studying all this time.</p><p></p><p>What should he cultivate next?</p><p></p><p>If he could cultivate imperial techniques, that would be great, because he already had several imperial techniques, and from the Supplementing the Heavens Technique and Dawn Star Technique, it seemed that imperial techniques could be further fused.</p><p></p><p>He really wanted to see how powerful the resulting cultivation method would be after fusing imperial techniques.</p><p></p><p>But there was no way, given the current scale of the library, to obtain imperial techniques, which was almost as difficult as ascending to the heavens.</p><p></p><p>Perhaps he should find a way to get some imperial techniques somewhere, and then use them for fusion.</p><p></p><p>But upon further reflection, there was no need to be too anxious. Since his current cultivation had only reached the peak of the Great Grandmaster, and had not yet reached the Divine Monarch Realm.</p><p></p><p>When he reached the peak of the Divine Monarch Realm, he could think about fusing imperial techniques again, and it would not be too late.</p><p></p><p>After all, once his strength reached that level, at least on Earth, there would be very few people who could pose a threat to him.</p><p></p><p>He calmed his mind and spiritual sense, and scanned through the cultivation techniques in his spiritual sea.</p><p></p><p>Among the foundational techniques, the Fist Techniques had already reached the sixth level, the most of any technique.</p><p></p><p>The Palm Techniques also had four volumes.</p><p></p><p>It seemed that he could consider focusing on these two types of techniques next.</p><p></p><p>As for things like Beast Taming, Puppet Techniques, or Poison Mastery, he had no interest at all.</p><p></p><p>They were too troublesome to learn, and he did not like to rely on spirit pets or puppets to augment his own strength. </p><p></p><p>Only by becoming stronger himself was true strength.</p><p></p><p>Moreover, someone like Huan Liuli, whose intelligence was not very high, could be easily manipulated with some mental control and turned into a docile lamb - what was the point of learning Beast Taming?</p><p></p><p>Speaking of Huan Liuli, where had she gone? </p><p></p><p>How come she still hadn't returned yet? That silly cat, could it be that she got lost?</p><p></p><p>After thinking for a while, Ye Xiao couldn't figure it out, and could only shake his head and not think about it further.</p><p></p><p>It was time to go to work. As for Huan Liuli's situation, he would deal with it when he sensed something.</p><p></p><p>Arriving at the library, Ye Xiao overheard his colleagues whispering to each other.</p><p></p><p>"Have you heard? This time the Seven Star Convergence, the city of Jianghai has mobilized the defense force, mercenary companies, as well as students and private cultivators - a total of over 2 million people."</p><p></p><p>The permanent population of Jianghai City was 7-8 million, and in this world, nearly everyone was a cultivator, just with varying levels of strength.</p><p></p><p>So this 2 million was actually not that impressive.</p><p></p><p>After all, the vast majority were only Postheavenly First or Second Realm ordinary people.</p><p></p><p>"Why is the defense so tight? Jianghai City is usually so peaceful, we don't even have a single star beast incident on a normal day."</p><p></p><p>Here is the full English translation of the excerpt from the Chinese novel:</p><p></p><p>"There's not even a trace of beast fur to be seen."</p><p></p><p>"It's always good to be cautious. And for most people, even if they just act as volunteers, when it comes to actual combat, in terms of destructive power, they'd have to be at least a Fifth-Rank Martial Cultivator to start counting."</p><p></p><p>"I heard that the overall commander for this operation is Master Nangong Ling from the Jianghai City Garrison. To better assist his command, the Nine Realms Alliance has also bestowed upon him a Grandmaster-level medicinal pill worth over 5 million, allowing him to break through to the Second Rank of Grandmaster."</p><p></p><p>"A Grandmaster-level medicinal pill, wow, just hearing about it makes me so envious. My family is about to be relocated, if only I could buy one..."</p><p></p><p>"What are you thinking? Although Grandmaster-level medicinal pills are priced at over 5 million on the market, they are not something that can be easily purchased with money alone.</p><p></p><p>To purchase medicinal pills of Grandmaster-level or above, one's qualifications must be verified. If your qualifications are insufficient, the Nine Realms will not allow you to purchase and consume them.</p><p></p><p>After all, Grandmaster-level medicinal pills are quite rare, and they are meant to be used to cultivate high-level martial artists as much as possible.</p><p></p><p>The reason why Master Nangong Ling was able to obtain one is that his qualifications are very high. At the age of 32, he had already broken through to the First Rank of Grandmaster. His 'Falling Rain Sword' technique is also exceptionally refined.</p><p></p><p>Now he is only just turning 40, with great potential. Before the age of 60, he has a good chance of breaking through to the Great Grandmaster Realm!"</p><p></p><p>As the discussion reached this point, the group once again expressed their admiration, envy, and resentment.</p><p></p><p>Ye Xiao, who was reading a book not far away, heard all of this conversation clearly.</p><p></p><p>As for Nangong Ling, Ye Xiao had actually heard of him before. When he was young, Nangong Ling was considered a renowned prodigy in Jianghai City, the kind of child that others could only envy.</p><p></p><p>In the Nine Realms, and even in the world, the average age for Grandmaster-level martial artists to break through is around 40 years old.</p><p></p><p>Those who can break through around the age of 30 can already be considered geniuses.</p><p></p><p>Like Pu Jiansheng, who has received guidance from a top-tier Divine Grandmaster and cultivates sword techniques at the Imperial level, he must have also consumed some excellent medicinal pills. Yet his cultivation has only reached the Ninth Rank of the Heavenly Realm.</p><p></p><p>For this kind of genius slightly below the top tier, if they start martial arts training from a young age and break through to Grandmaster without any extraordinary encounters, it would probably take them around 26-27 years.</p><p></p><p>This illustrates the difficulty of breaking through to the Grandmaster Realm.</p><p></p><p>Ye Xiao is just over 20 years old, not yet 21, and yet he has broken through from the First Rank of the Heavenly Realm to the peak of the Grandmaster Realm within a single year. This is likely a unique feat in the entire world.</p><p></p><p>At the end of the day, it is the power of his divine soul that makes the difference.</p><p></p><p>For normal cultivators, in addition to the martial dao, they can only focus on one or two cultivation methods. If they try to cultivate more, they will become distracted, and it would be less effective than just focusing on one or two.</p><p></p><p>Moreover, they can only activate their cultivation methods during meditation or combat.</p><p></p><p>But Ye Xiao's divine soul is already proficient in nearly ten Imperial-level cultivation methods, and they are all constantly self-cultivating, like an automatic game, so his speed is far beyond what ordinary people can match.</p><p></p><p>As for medicinal pills, the one he refined using the Black Scale Snake is of a higher standard than ordinary Grandmaster-level pills, although it has not yet reached the level of Imperial Pills. It is at least equivalent to five or six regular Grandmaster pills.</p><p></p><p>Looking at it this way, it would not be an exaggeration to say that he has "broken the game."</p><p></p><p>He has not only opened this backdoor for himself, but he has also forcefully pried it open as wide as possible! Regarding such matters, he can only say that the heavens have gone mad!</p><p></p><p>(This chapter ends)</p>

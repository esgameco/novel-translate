        <h1>Chapter 14</h1>
        <div class="content">
            <p>Here is the full English translation of the Chinese excerpt:</p><p></p><p>"What is this?" Ye Xiao was somewhat taken aback.</p><p></p><p>He just glanced at this cultivation method, and the golden book suddenly pulsed. Doesn't this mean that the heart cultivation method on it is an evolved version of a different origin heart cultivation method from his own?</p><p></p><p>"Unexpectedly, there is an additional harvest." Ye Xiao smiled slightly and began to study the heart cultivation method on the giant stone.</p><p></p><p>Soon, a complete origin heart cultivation method was imprinted on the golden book's divine soul.</p><p></p><p>At this moment, the ten pages with the origin heart cultivation method were all emanating a pure golden color, which meant that Ye Xiao could now refine an extremely powerful heart cultivation method.</p><p></p><p>"If I remember correctly, this heart cultivation method and cultivation technique should have been contributed by Professor Long Feng to the academy, right?"</p><p></p><p>Given Ye Xiao's formidable swordsmanship, he could naturally see the flaws in the Tao family's swordsmanship techniques.</p><p></p><p>"To not return a favor is improper. Since I have obtained the Tao family's heart cultivation method, let me help the Tao family complete their swordsmanship technique."</p><p></p><p>In the blink of an eye, Ye Xiao's eyes shot out numerous sword beams. He controlled them with great precision, carving the complete cultivation technique on the giant stone, and then turned to leave, heading back to the riverside to refine the heart cultivation method.</p><p></p><p>Not long after Ye Xiao left, a fellow student passed by and saw the densely written sword technique symbols on the giant stone, as well as the scattered broken stones on the ground. He was first stunned, and then his expression changed drastically.</p><p></p><p>"Oh no! Oh no! Somebody come quickly! Someone has destroyed Professor Tao's cultivation technique!"</p><p></p><p>This disturbance quickly reached the main classroom.</p><p></p><p>Qin Shenglong immediately flew into a rage.</p><p></p><p>"Which bastard did this?" </p><p></p><p>The giant stone was the school's affirmation of their dear friend Professor Tao's contribution, and now it had been destroyed. This was undoubtedly a disrespect to Professor Tao! How could he tolerate this? Professor Tao, however, did not get overly angry, but instead gently waved his hand and said:</p><p></p><p>"Old Qin, don't worry about it. It was probably just some kids who didn't know any better."</p><p></p><p>Qin Shenglong clenched his fists and snorted coldly.</p><p></p><p>"If it weren't for you teaching the class, I would go find that stinking brat right now."</p><p></p><p>As soon as he finished speaking, someone rushed in from outside.</p><p></p><p>"Dean, Professor Tao, a terrible thing has happened. A student cultivated the modified Tao family cultivation technique and his meridians have ruptured. He's in grave danger."</p><p></p><p>"What?" Qin Shenglong's face instantly turned completely cold.</p><p></p><p>"I'll go take a look."</p><p></p><p>Professor Tao raised his eyebrows slightly and followed.</p><p></p><p>"I'll go take a look as well. The rest of you stay in the classroom and digest the knowledge points I just taught. I'll be back shortly."</p><p></p><p>The two of them were at the peak of their cultivation, so they arrived at the giant stone in the blink of an eye.</p><p></p><p>Sure enough, a student was lying on the ground, covered in blood and barely clinging to life. </p><p></p><p>The other students didn't dare touch him, and some were even taking photos.</p><p></p><p>Qin Shenglong first swept a glance at the stone tablet, his fury boiling over, then immediately crouched down to take the student's pulse and check his physical condition.</p><p></p><p>When he examined the student's meridians, his face grew even darker.</p><p></p><p>"Damn it! He's suffered a deviation! It's definitely because the cultivation technique was carelessly tampered with, causing him to deviate!"</p><p></p><p>Professor Tao, on the other hand, did not go look at the student on the ground, as Qin Shenglong alone was sufficient.</p><p></p><p>He needed to examine the cultivation technique, find out what kind of erroneous technique it had been modified into, in order to properly treat the student.</p><p></p><p>However, the moment he laid eyes on the technique, his hair stood on end! He then quickly stepped forward and carefully studied the entire cultivation technique. After fully understanding it, his expression became one of pure delight.</p><p></p><p>"My goodness!"</p><p></p><p>But before he could exclaim out loud...</p><p></p><p>Here is the full English translation of the excerpt:</p><p></p><p>He laughed, as if he had thought of something, but his entire expression suddenly became solemn and serious. "Shenglong, hurry! Hurry and have these students delete the photos. No one can let this cultivation technique be revealed! Hurry!"</p><p></p><p>Qin Shenglong was startled, and immediately carried out the order, asking the teachers to go up one by one to check the students' phones, and delete any photos they found. At the same time, he also had them retract any posts that had been shared on social media or forums.</p><p></p><p>"Elder Dou, is this cultivation technique really that big of a problem?"</p><p></p><p>Dou Changfeng did not respond to him, but instead released a blade of qi, splitting the huge boulder and taking out the side with the cultivation technique.</p><p></p><p>"This is not the place to talk. Come, let's go to your office."</p><p></p><p>Without waiting for him to speak, Dou Changfeng took the stone tablet with the cultivation technique and hurried towards Qin Shenglong's office. Qin Shenglong immediately followed after him.</p><p></p><p>"Elder Dou, what are you doing? Have you researched it? That student's condition doesn't look good, I need to hurry and rescue him!"</p><p></p><p>Dou Changfeng shook his head. "Don't worry, he's not in a state of deviation, he won't die."</p><p></p><p>"Not in a state of deviation? Then what is it?"</p><p></p><p>"His meridians have been ruptured!"</p><p></p><p>Qin Shenglong looked confused. "I don't understand what you're saying at all."</p><p></p><p>As Dou Changfeng caressed the stone tablet like a lover, he explained, "That person did not tamper with my cultivation technique, but rather completed it. The blade technique of my Dou family is only at the quasi-master level, but it is actually incomplete. This person has filled in the gaps, greatly improving the level of the Dou family's blade technique.</p><p></p><p>The student cultivating the technique is not strong enough, which caused his meridians to rupture when the technique was activated!"</p><p></p><p>Qin Shenglong was completely dumbfounded. He knew that the Dou family's blade technique was an incomplete technique, as Dou Changfeng had told him before. But now someone had actually completed it - this was truly shocking.</p><p></p><p>After all, the Dou family had spent countless generations trying to repair this blade technique, but even the incomplete version was at the quasi-master level. For someone unknown to have successfully completed it, their mastery of the blade technique must be incredibly powerful.</p><p></p><p>"Elder Dou, you can't be joking with me, right?"</p><p></p><p>"Do you think I have the time to joke with you?"</p><p></p><p>"Then, what level is this cultivation technique now? Has it reached the master level?"</p><p></p><p>Dou Changfeng took a deep breath, his serious expression unable to hide his joy.</p><p></p><p>"What do you think? Would I be this happy if it was just a master level technique?"</p><p></p><p>Boom! This sentence was like a heavy bomb exploding in Qin Shenglong's mind, completely stunning him.</p><p></p><p>The amount of information contained in Dou Changfeng's words was truly massive. He was right, as a professor at the Beijing Martial Arts University, Dou Changfeng had surely seen many master level techniques before. So if this was truly a master level technique, he wouldn't be this excited.</p><p></p><p>Qin Shenglong swallowed hard, carefully asking, "Elder Dou, just what level is this cultivation technique?"</p>

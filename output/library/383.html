        <h1>Chapter 383</h1>
        <div class="content">
            <p>Here is the full English translation of the Chinese excerpt:</p><p></p><p>After a pause, Ning Zhiyuan spoke again:</p><p></p><p>"I have already sent people to investigate the situation of the Black Soul Deity Clan. If the Black Soul Deity Clan still exists, but has not appeared due to fearing me, then the problem should not be too serious. </p><p></p><p>If it's because the other party..."</p><p></p><p>Before he could finish his words, a figure quickly rushed in.</p><p></p><p>"Report to the young master, we have already investigated."</p><p></p><p>Ning Zhiyuan raised his eyebrows slightly.</p><p></p><p>"How did you find out so quickly?"</p><p></p><p>"To reply to the young master, the matter of the Black Soul Deity Clan has been widely circulating among the hundred clans these past few days, so we were able to easily obtain their news."</p><p></p><p>"Speak quickly."</p><p></p><p>"Yes! The Black Soul Deity Clan was wiped out on the day they encountered Xiong Bengong in our Jianghai City. Not a single member of the Black Soul Clan escaped. Moreover, the terrifying thing is that their three Shen Hun (Divine Soul) nine-layered experts who used the Substitute Technique to return, were also slaughtered.</p><p></p><p>Even the Mingao (Dark Elder) of the Beimingxin Clan rushed over to help, but was also sacrificed."</p><p></p><p>Upon hearing these words, both Ning Zhiyuan and his second uncle could not help but have their pupils contract, and even felt their own body hair stand on end.</p><p></p><p>Ning Zhiyuan's face turned solemn as he said, "I have seen that Beimingxin Clan's Mingao before. If I'm not mistaken, his cultivation should have already reached the peak of the Divine Realm, at the verge of Slaughter God. </p><p></p><p>At this level, he was actually slaughtered? Could it be that his strength has already broken through to the Slaughter God Realm?"</p><p></p><p>"My goodness! If that's the case, then what I said before was wrong. This guy won't surpass our generation in a few years, he may have already surpassed our generation now.</p><p></p><p>This is too terrifying!"</p><p></p><p>Ning Er-shu felt that the goosebumps on his body were about to fall off.</p><p></p><p>In the starry sky, he had lived for several decades, but he had never heard of such a thing before.</p><p></p><p>To put it bluntly, this Sword Immortal's reverse talent is so shocking that even the qualifications of the gods seem like child's play in his eyes.</p><p></p><p>"Zhiyuan, you said he is also in this world... Could he be the descendant of that person?"</p><p></p><p>Ning Zhiyuan's face turned extremely solemn.</p><p></p><p>Of course he knew who his second uncle was referring to.</p><p></p><p>Zhuangyuan! The mythical figure of the Xuanyuan Deity Clan for tens of thousands of years! Since the founding of the Xuanyuan Deity Clan, there have been many dazzling figures in the long history of the starry sky, but if one had to pick the most dazzling existence, it would definitely be him!</p><p></p><p>More than two thousand years ago, the ranking of the Xuanyuan Deity Clan in the starry sky was already on the verge of collapse. At that time, the true strength of the Xuanyuan Deity Clan had almost fallen out of the top thirty.</p><p></p><p>It was the appearance of that man that allowed the Xuanyuan Deity Clan to reach its current state, once again returning to the top twenty.</p><p></p><p>Unfortunately, after pulling the Xuanyuan Deity Clan back to this level, he left the Xuanyuan Deity Clan to pursue the martial dao that his heart longed for.</p><p></p><p>If that were not the case, with his alone existence, the Xuanyuan Deity Clan would most likely have already risen to the top ten in the starry sky! If this person is his descendant and possesses such powerful reverse talent, will his future also have the potential to grow into an existence like Zhuangyuan?</p><p></p><p>Ning Zhiyuan took a deep breath.</p><p></p><p>"Starting from tomorrow, we must search the Star Tombs in the starry sky, and the warriors on the ground must also begin the search. We must find him with all our might.</p><p></p><p>This peerless genius must be found by the Ning family first, and we must personally serve him.</p><p></p><p>In this way, the future of the Ning family will definitely be promising."</p><p></p><p>"Yes!"</p><p></p><p>In the starry sky, a sea of golden-colored blood was constantly being absorbed into a figure.</p><p></p><p>After all the blood sea was completely absorbed into his body, his aura also began to soar.</p><p></p><p>In the blink of an eye, he broke through to the ninth layer of the Divine Realm, at the verge of the Slaughter God Realm.</p><p></p><p>He opened his eyes, and a chilling bloodthirsty intent was revealed in his gaze, as cold as two sword beams.</p><p></p><p>"I've finally broken through to the ninth layer of the Divine Realm. After hundreds of years, ever since my meridians were destroyed and I was kicked out of the Su family, I have been painstakingly pursuing this for so many years, and my strength is finally beginning to recover."</p><p></p><p>The jade ring on his hand flashed with a bloody light.</p><p></p><p>"But this is still early. The Blood Technique is an evolving cultivation method, and the blood you have absorbed so far is far from enough. It hasn't even evolved into a Treasure Technique yet. It's only at the level of a Nine-Star Divine Technique now.</p><p></p><p>You still need more divine blood to upgrade the Blood Technique to the Treasure Technique level, so that your cultivation speed can be even faster."</p><p></p><p>"Teacher is right. After I upgrade the Blood Technique to the Treasure Technique level and raise my cultivation to the Divine Emperor realm, I can return to the Su family and take revenge for what happened back then.</p><p></p><p>At that time, I will use the essence blood of the entire Su family to personally sculpt a divine body for my teacher, so that my teacher and I can conquer the starry sky together and become the overlords of the entire starry sky!"</p><p></p><p>"Hehe, Chener, your teacher has always been by your side, waiting for the day you succeed."</p><p></p><p>As he spoke, the air distorted, and a black shadow slowly appeared beside Su Chen, handing him a slip of paper.</p><p></p><p>"Young master,..."</p><p></p><p>Here is my translation of the Chinese excerpt:</p><p></p><p>This is the recent situation in the Canglan Star Domain.</p><p></p><p>Su Chen took it over.</p><p></p><p>"You can go down first."</p><p></p><p>"Yes, sir!"</p><p></p><p>After the other person left, Su Chen opened the slip and glanced at it, immediately narrowing his eyes.</p><p></p><p>"What! How could this be?"</p><p></p><p>"What's the matter?"</p><p></p><p>"This slip says that there are not just a few divine tombs there, but countless ones. From the time we left until now, it's estimated that over a million have been excavated.</p><p></p><p>The major direct lineage families of the Xuanyuan Clan, as well as nearly a hundred divine clans, have all come to the Canglan Star Domain, and their numbers are still continuously increasing. </p><p></p><p>Even more importantly, they have now excavated the tombs of the Divine Kings."</p><p></p><p>"Oh? There's actually such a thing? This is truly beyond what I expected. I was a bit curious before about why there would be so many divine tombs in that place, since the location of the Canglan Star Domain is so remote.</p><p></p><p>Now it seems that there is likely an ancient divine nation buried there, or at the very least, a major power from the ancient era."</p><p></p><p>A hint of envy flashed across Su Chen's eyes.</p><p></p><p>"I never expected these people to have such good luck, suddenly obtaining so many benefits."</p><p></p><p>"Chen√©r, you don't need to worry about that. Even if they obtain a legacy of a Divine Emperor, what use is it to them? The Blood Curse is the most evil and fierce cultivation method in the starry sky. As long as you continuously absorb divine blood, even ten or a hundred Divine Emperor legacies would not surpass your final accomplishments."</p><p></p><p>Su Chen nodded.</p><p></p><p>"Master is right. However, I do have a new idea."</p><p></p><p>"Oh? What idea?"</p><p></p><p>"Since the Canglan Star Domain has so many good things that can continuously attract those divine clans, I should take the opportunity to sow discord among them, making them slaughter each other. The more of them that die, the more divine blood I can obtain, and the easier it will be to activate the power of the Blood Curse and let it complete its next evolution."</p><p></p><p>"That makes sense. But you must be careful, your current strength is not yet that powerful. Don't expose your identity, or you will end up in a lot of trouble, or even a calamity."</p><p></p><p>"Don't worry, I know what I'm doing."</p><p></p><p>On Ye Xiao's side, his days continued to pass leisurely, as if the events outside had nothing to do with him.</p><p></p><p>Every day, he would read books, excavate the divine nation's treasury, eat star beast meat, and commute back and forth between two points - his life was extremely simple.</p><p></p><p>But even though his life was simple, his cultivation was steadily rising every day.</p><p></p><p>It wasn't long before he felt that something was off about the entire city.</p><p></p><p>He couldn't quite put his finger on it, but he felt that the city had taken on a slightly more serious atmosphere.</p><p></p><p>The Ning Family had organized a series of activities - a nationwide assessment of martial dao talent, a nationwide assessment of cultivation, and relaxing the requirements for viewing imperial arts, allowing those with lower strength to also start learning imperial arts.</p><p></p><p>The series of events behind this made Ye Xiao feel that things were not as simple as they appeared.</p><p></p><p>However, he didn't dare to directly go find Beitang Ce and the others.</p><p></p><p>Beitang Ce, Jing Emperor, and Qinglong had all been gathered by the Ning Family to Jianghai City, leaving the other cities to be guarded by other families.</p><p></p><p>Beitang Ce and the others were also the objects of special care, so if he randomly went to find them, it might arouse others' suspicions.</p><p></p><p>Finally, one day when Ye Xiao was at work, he encountered Beitang Ce coming to borrow books.</p><p></p><p>He finally had the opportunity to ask about the doubts in his heart.</p><p></p><p>"Senior Beitang, what is the Ning Family doing?"</p><p></p><p>Beitang Ce spoke:</p><p></p><p>"You don't know? Well, it's understandable, since you're always in this library, not going out much, so you wouldn't know about some things."</p><p></p><p>Pausing, he continued:</p><p></p><p>"A few nights ago, there were three violent explosions in the Nine States. I don't know if you heard them?"</p><p></p><p>Ye Xiao nodded.</p><p></p><p>"Of course I heard them, such a loud noise, even if I didn't want to hear it, I still would have."</p><p></p><p>"Do you know what those three violent explosions represent?"</p><p></p><p>Ye Xiao shook his head, and Beitang Ce's expression became grave.</p><p></p><p>"Those three explosions represent that there is an invincible genius in our Nine States.</p><p></p><p>That was the talent pillar they excavated from the tomb. As long as it's placed on the ground, it will find all the talents within a certain range around it.</p><p></p><p>Do you know? The young masters of the major direct lineage families of the Xuanyuan Clan, when added together, only lit up 240 layers.</p><p></p><p>But for the Nine States?"</p><p></p><p>Beitang Ce paused.</p><p></p><p>"The Nine States had three that directly lit up to 999 layers.</p><p></p><p>In the end, they even exploded the stone pillar because the talent was too extraordinary.</p><p></p><p>Aside from you, there shouldn't be a second person in the Nine States with this kind of ability, right?</p><p></p><p>Even if there was a second person, they would still be from the Nine States!"</p><p></p><p>The corners of Ye Xiao's mouth couldn't help but twitch violently.</p>

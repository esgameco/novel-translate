        <h1>Chapter 67</h1>
        <div class="content">
            <p>Here is the full English translation of the Chinese excerpt:</p><p></p><p>Ning Yuhen patted his chest, and Ye Xiao gently nodded.</p><p></p><p>"Okay."</p><p></p><p>The two walked side by side into the restaurant.</p><p></p><p>An hour later.</p><p></p><p>Ning Yuhen held the chopsticks, looking at the piled up plates in front of him, as well as Ye Xiao and Illusion Liuli who were still eating, and couldn't help but doubt life.</p><p></p><p>"Manager, you two have eaten so much, aren't you afraid of being bloated?"</p><p></p><p>In fact, after the cultivation level is improved, no matter how much you eat, you won't feel bloated.</p><p></p><p>Because when the cultivation level is improved, the physical fitness will also be correspondingly improved.</p><p></p><p>The food that is eaten will be quickly digested into nutrients by the spiritual energy in the body and stored.</p><p></p><p>Ye Xiao only needs to taste the flavor of the dishes and does not need the energy they bring.</p><p></p><p>So he just ate a little more.</p><p></p><p>But it's time to stop now.</p><p></p><p>Ye Xiao put down his bowl and chopsticks, took out a tissue to wipe his mouth, and said calmly:</p><p></p><p>"I'm done eating."</p><p></p><p>Ning Yuhen wiped the cold sweat on his forehead, he was really afraid that Ye Xiao would burst his stomach.</p><p></p><p>"It's good that you're done eating, it's not early, I'll go pay the bill."</p><p></p><p>After saying that, he immediately got up to pay the bill, and when he saw the string of numbers on the bill, Ning Yuhen couldn't help but shiver violently.</p><p></p><p>Sixty-five thousand seven hundred and twenty-one.</p><p></p><p>This is too harsh! Although the food here is more expensive, the average consumption is over 10,000, but the manager and his cat, their total consumption is equivalent to the food expenses of four or five people.</p><p></p><p>They eat too much, right? No, I can't bring the manager to this kind of place to eat again in the future.</p><p></p><p>Although the money is earned by selling the books the manager gave me, after eating three or four times, I'll have to pay extra money.</p><p></p><p>"Have you paid the bill?"</p><p></p><p>Ye Xiao walked over with Illusion Liuli in his arms, and Ning Yuhen nodded.</p><p></p><p>"I've paid it."</p><p></p><p>"Then let's go back."</p><p></p><p>"Okay!"</p><p></p><p>The two walked out of the restaurant together and headed towards the street corner, although their paths were different, this part of the road was the same.</p><p></p><p>"Where does the manager live?"</p><p></p><p>"In the suburbs."</p><p></p><p>"The suburbs? That's very far, is it convenient for going to work?"</p><p></p><p>"It's okay, the main thing is the rent is cheap."</p><p></p><p>"How cheap can it be? The manager's salary is 10,000 a month, right? Why not find a place closer, more convenient for going to work."</p><p></p><p>"It's only 100 yuan a month."</p><p></p><p>Ning Yuhen: "(!?)"</p><p></p><p>Are the houses in the suburbs really that cheap? It seems I should ask about it too.</p><p></p><p>Living in the library is free, but it's not very convenient with so many employees.</p><p></p><p>And the library is crowded, if I accidentally reveal my star beast bloodline aura, won't that be a big trouble? Just as he was thinking about it, suddenly a deadly sense of crisis descended, making all the hairs on his body stand on end.</p><p></p><p>"This feeling? This powerful aura...? Could it be him? Manager, you go away, the farther the better. No, it's too late, I'll go, manager, don't follow me."</p><p></p><p>With that, he immediately burst out with all his strength and fled in another direction.</p><p></p><p>Ning Yuhen was a post-heaven fifth-grade, and he thought Ye Xiao was only a post-heaven second-grade, so it would be better for him to run away rather than let Ye Xiao escape.</p><p></p><p>The one who came to hunt him this time was too powerful, so powerful that Ning Yuhen didn't even have the heart to resist.</p><p></p><p>He knew that this time he definitely couldn't escape, but he had to run, at least this way he wouldn't implicate the manager.</p><p></p><p>Ye Xiao shook his head.</p><p></p><p>"This fool, he's almost dead and still thinking of others?"</div></p><p></p><p>Here is the full English translation of the Chinese excerpt:</p><p></p><p>Of course, he understood why Ning Yuhen had to leave, because he had also sensed that force, and even earlier than Ning Yuhen.</p><p></p><p>They were two innate first-grade semi-beast masters.</p><p></p><p>It was obvious that they were assassins sent by the Beast God Sect.</p><p></p><p>After all, last time, he had wiped out two of their disciples.</p><p></p><p>And Ning Yuhen must have wanted to lure the enemy away by escaping through him, to avoid harming himself.</p><p></p><p>Ye Xiao patted his belly.</p><p></p><p>"After eating so much, I should properly digest it."</p><p></p><p>Ning Yuhen's speed was very fast, and he disappeared at the end of the street in just a few breaths.</p><p></p><p>His own cultivation was only at the post-celestial fifth grade, so he shouldn't have had such a fast speed. Ye Xiao judged at a glance that Ning Yuhen's silver fox bloodline had provided some assistance.</p><p></p><p>It seems that the techniques contained in the same star beast bloodline are far more than one.</p><p></p><p>No wonder the semi-beast masters are so strong.</p><p></p><p>However, Ning Yuhen had only run out of one street when a huge impact force swept over his legs.</p><p></p><p>"Bang!"</p><p></p><p>Accompanied by a violent explosion, Ning Yuhen's lower legs were directly blown apart on the spot.</p><p></p><p>"Ah!"</p><p></p><p>He let out a miserable scream and fell to the ground with a "plop".</p><p></p><p>The excruciating pain made his whole body tremble uncontrollably.</p><p></p><p>In the darkness, a tall, thin figure with eyes as fierce as a wolf slowly emerged.</p><p></p><p>His muscles were bulging all over his body, and although he was thin, he did not lose the beauty of his strength.</p><p></p><p>Wrapped around his two arms were thick metal chains, which were his weapons, at the level of a sub-master.</p><p></p><p>"Little bastard, do you think you can run away from me?"</p><p></p><p>Ning Yuhen gritted his teeth and trembled as he said:</p><p></p><p>"Blue Wolf Master? I didn't expect the Beast God Sect to send such a powerful expert to hunt me down."</p><p></p><p>"Don't flatter yourself. It doesn't take me to hunt you down. I'm here for the one who protected you last time."</p><p></p><p>With that, Blue Wolf lashed out his chain, which struck Ning Yuhen's chest with a vengeance.</p><p></p><p>"Puchi!"</p><p></p><p>Ning Yuhen was sent flying, his chest a bloody mess, exposing the white bones inside.</p><p></p><p>"You have the bloodline of the silver fox, and even though you've been so badly injured, you'll heal quickly.</p><p></p><p>But I'm sure you won't choose such a painful path. Tell me, who killed Basan and Meg? Tell me, and I'll give you a quick death."</p><p></p><p>The Blue Wolf Master's tone was one of unquestionable arrogance.</p><p></p><p>He didn't even consider Ning Yuhen worthy of his attention, in his eyes Ning Yuhen was just a tiny ant, not worth mentioning.</p><p></p><p>Even the way he died was under his control.</p><p></p><p>Ning Yuhen was in so much pain that he was almost unconscious, but he still gritted his teeth and persisted, spitting out a mouthful of blood.</p><p></p><p>"Kill me, I won't say anything."</p><p></p><p>Blue Wolf looked at his resolute gaze and sneered.</p><p></p><p>"Foolish trash, as stupid as your mother, stubborn and unyielding.</p><p></p><p>But do you think you can change anything?"</p><p></p><p>As Blue Wolf spoke, a lazy, slightly seductive voice quietly fell into Ning Yuhen's ear.</p><p></p><p>"Blue Wolf, don't scare the little kid."</p><p></p><p>Hearing this voice, Ning Yuhen's pupils immediately shrank.</p><p></p><p>"This voice... is the Charming Fox Master? The Beast God Sect has actually sent out two masters, one a spiritual master?"</p>

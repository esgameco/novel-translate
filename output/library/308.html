        <h1>Chapter 308</h1>
        <div class="content">
            <p>Here is the full English translation of the Chinese excerpt:</p><p></p><p>It's actually not surprising that they were shocked, because Ye Xiao's little potted plant contained several extremely powerful techniques.</p><p></p><p>First, the forging technique.</p><p></p><p>The ability to perfectly arrange the spatial forces on a piece of ten-thousand-year-old meteorite iron shows that the other party's forging technique is extraordinary.</p><p></p><p>As the saying goes, the forging masters of the Nine Provinces are the most supreme in the world. </p><p></p><p>But even so, with the current forging masters of the Nine Provinces, it would take the collective effort of the top forging grandmasters, working for several days and nights, to have a chance of forging this item.</p><p></p><p>And even then, there's no guarantee they wouldn't fail. </p><p></p><p>It would require no mistakes or failures to complete it in just a few days.</p><p></p><p>This first point alone is already extremely rare and precious.</p><p></p><p>The second point is that a very advanced spirit-gathering formation was engraved on this pot.</p><p></p><p>With their knowledge and vision, they could see at a glance that this formation was extraordinary.</p><p></p><p>An Imperial Formation! A true Imperial Formation! Just like the previous forging factor, it would require the collaboration of the top formation masters of the Nine Provinces to set up such a formation.</p><p></p><p>What's even more shocking is that the larger the formation, the easier it is to operate, as it doesn't have such high requirements for details.</p><p></p><p>The smaller the formation, the more difficult it becomes.</p><p></p><p>Creating a core boat is not necessarily easier than creating a real boat.</p><p></p><p>Moreover, there is not only a spirit-gathering formation, but also a defensive formation here.</p><p></p><p>Two Imperial Formations in total - truly monstrous, making several people involuntarily sneer.</p><p></p><p>As for the third point, it's the precious spiritual treasures contained within.</p><p></p><p>These items are extremely rare and precious things.</p><p></p><p>Of course, when we say rare, that's from the perspective of ordinary people. For an existence like Ye Xiao, they are relatively easy to find.</p><p></p><p>Super strong experts, who can fly fast and have powerful perception, finding some spiritual treasures is a piece of cake.</p><p></p><p>But the problem lies in cultivating and breeding these spiritual treasures.</p><p></p><p>This is not something that can be achieved through cultivation alone.</p><p></p><p>Not only has Ye Xiao taken good care of them, but he has also made them breed more spiritual treasures, which is the most precious.</p><p></p><p>These three aspects combined have undoubtedly cost Ye Xiao a great deal of effort.</p><p></p><p>But what makes everyone feel their hearts bleeding is that Ye Xiao is also a martial dao master.</p><p></p><p>A top-tier martial dao master.</p><p></p><p>And he's only 21 years old.</p><p></p><p>21 years old!</p><p></p><p>Reaching the Emperor Realm in martial dao cultivation is a realm that others may not be able to catch up to in ten or even a hundred lifetimes.</p><p></p><p>He also knows formations, forging, and can cultivate spiritual treasures - do others even need to live anymore?</p><p></p><p>"Ye Xiao, did you do all of these by yourself? I mean, the forging and the formation deployment, were they all done by you alone?"</p><p></p><p>Ye Xiao nodded.</p><p></p><p>"Is there a problem?"</p><p></p><p>The group was silent for a moment, then shook their heads.</p><p></p><p>"No problem."</p><p></p><p>They had completely given up on struggling against Ye Xiao's overwhelming strength. Asking further would only be humiliating themselves, so they had no need to say anything more. They could only silently exclaim in their hearts, "This guy is a true monster!"</p><p></p><p>"Senior friends, please come in."</p><p></p><p>The group nodded and followed Ye Xiao into the room.</p><p></p><p>Ye Xiao had the Illusion Jade Maid serve tea.</p><p></p><p>In the room, the group finally regained a bit of normalcy.</p><p></p><p>Not everything in Ye Xiao's home was shocking - most of it was quite ordinary. It was just a few exceptional things that could shatter one's worldview.</p><p></p><p>This made the group respect Ye Xiao even more.</p><p></p><p>Even though he was so powerful, with such monstrous talent, he did not pursue a luxurious lifestyle. All his thoughts were completely focused on cultivation.</p><p></p><p>He deserved to be so strong!</p><p></p><p>After drinking the tea, Qinglong began to speak: "We came here this time for two things. First, of course, is to thank you for helping us break through."</p><p></p><p>Ye Xiao smiled.</p><p></p><p>"That was just a small favor, no need to be so polite."</p><p></p><p>"But it's true, if it weren't for you, we two wouldn't know when we could break through."</p><p></p><p>Pausing, Qinglong continued:</p><p></p><p>"The second thing is about the beast disaster. What do you think about this matter?"</p><p></p><p>Ye Xiao shook his head.</p><p></p><p>"To be honest, I don't have any good ideas about this. Tactical guidance is not my strong suit. I'm good at one-on-one combat, or fighting against multiple opponents, as long as their cultivation isn't far beyond mine."</p><p></p><p>Ye Xiao was telling the truth - no one can be perfect at everything.</p><p></p><p>Qinglong looked at Jiang Chen. "Xuanwu, you should be the most adept in this area. Do you have any thoughts?"</p><p></p><p>Jiang Chen sat up straight.</p><p></p><p>"To be honest, I'm also at a loss in the face of this situation.</p><p></p><p>Previous beast disasters were still manageable, but this time, it has far exceeded our ability to withstand.</p><p></p><p>The Twelve Supremes, each one is comparable to an Emperor Realm expert of the human race! Even if we gather all the top human experts...</p><p></p><p>Here is the full English translation of the Chinese excerpt:</p><p></p><p>"Now we have you and Ye Xiao as two Empyrean Realm cultivators, making a total of eight Empyrean Realm cultivators. However, we still have a huge imbalance in terms of the highest combat power compared to the other side.</p><p></p><p>Apart from the highest combat power, the other side already had close to two hundred Spiritual Beast Realm experts before, and this time, even the Supernal Beasts have increased. How much do you think the Spiritual Beast Realm experts will have increased by?</p><p></p><p>The number is simply incalculable.</p><p></p><p>So we can only go all out in this battle, but who knows how far we can go? Or whether we can hold out until the end, no one can say for sure."</p><p></p><p>The Vermilion Bird spoke:</p><p></p><p>"Leaving other matters aside, just within the Nine Prefectures alone, we have no way to protect everyone. Because the Nine Prefectures are simply too vast, with the largest population that is also widely dispersed, it's difficult to gather them in a short time."</p><p></p><p>The White Tiger Venerable said:</p><p></p><p>"If we really can't save everyone, then we should just concentrate on gathering what we can. Gather the strongest ones first to preserve the human seed."</p><p></p><p>Ye Xiao's brow furrowed slightly.</p><p></p><p>He was someone who had communicated with the Tyrant King before.</p><p></p><p>From the history of the Nine Prefectures since the Zhou dynasty, the strategy towards the human race has changed from utilizing all resources to concentrating and dividing resources by class.</p><p></p><p>Admittedly, this approach is more rational and can indeed preserve more elites, but the vast majority of the Nine Prefectures' human race will perish.</p><p></p><p>Ye Xiao was not a saint, but those people were also warriors who had always strived and fought for the Nine Prefectures.</p><p></p><p>They had no choice, just because their talents were slightly inferior, they had to give up more cultivation resources to supply the elite warriors.</p><p></p><p>In a sense, this was also a form of dedication.</p><p></p><p>Their hearts supporting the Nine Prefectures and their courageous fighting spirit for the entire Nine Prefectures were no less than those elite warriors!</p><p></p><p>If they were simply abandoned, it would be too cold-blooded.</p><p></p><p>Furthermore, there was another very important point.</p><p></p><p>Although their talents were not good, all the human race in the Nine Prefectures were of the same lineage, all descendants of the Xuanyuan Clan.</p><p></p><p>Their blood also contained divine blood, and if the Supernal Beasts were to refine it, it would inevitably increase the number of Empyrean Realm experts. Wouldn't that be digging their own graves? Abandoning one's own kind will also inevitably lead to backlash, this kind of causal problem is commonly seen.</p><p></p><p>If we can protect these people and provide them with guidance, to massively improve their strength, they will definitely play an unexpected role in the future battles against the Supernal Beasts.</p><p></p><p>Ye Xiao had already thought of a problem.</p><p></p><p>That is, this calamity of the beasts may inflict a huge impact on the entire human race, the human population may drastically decrease.</p><p></p><p>Therefore, every human is extremely precious.</p><p></p><p>It's best to protect as many as possible, otherwise, when there's a shortage of people in the future, we may not even be able to protect them then.</p><p></p><p>"I think this method won't work," Ye Xiao directly expressed his opinion.</p><p></p><p>"Every human is precious, and if they are cultivated, they will become a tremendous combat force. If we hand them over to the Supernal Beasts, it will only strengthen the Beasts' power.</p><p></p><p>Of course, what you said is also correct, with our current strength, we have no way to protect all the people in the Nine Prefectures.</p><p></p><p>But we can utilize all available resources, try to gather the human race at a few key points. Then rely on Imperial Formations to defend, and supplement them with powerful combat forces to guard."</p><p></p><p>Jiang Chen shook his head.</p><p></p><p>"The method you mentioned is good, but it's too idealistic.</p><p></p><p>What the White Tiger said, to first concentrate and protect a small number of elites, is more feasible.</p><p></p><p>To try to protect all the people in the entire Nine Prefectures, the cost would be too great.</p><p></p><p>Just talking about the Imperial Formations you mentioned, they require spirit stones. Only with enough spirit stones can the formations fully display their power.</p><p></p><p>If there are not enough spirit stones, no matter how high the formation's grade, it won't be able to exert its maximum power, it won't be an Imperial Formation!"</p><p></p><p>"I know this point, and I've already thought of some solutions.</p><p></p><p>First, utilize the Dragon Veins. The power of the Dragon Veins is sufficient to power a super-large formation.</p><p></p><p>Just the Long White Dragon Vein alone can protect a considerable number of people.</p><p>There's also the Southwest Primeval Forest, which has a Dragon Vein as well.</p><p></p><p>Second, if the Dragon Veins are not enough, we can use Supernal Beasts as the formation's core. Concentrate the Supernal Beasts from various cities, seal them within an Imperial Formation, combined with a Spirit-Gathering Formation, to form a super-large defensive formation. This should be able to create several sanctuaries.</p><p></p><p>Like the Jianghai City, with my Supernal Beast breeding ground, it can provide a lot of spiritual energy to drive the formation, no need for Dragon Veins, and it can still meet the requirements.</p><p></p><p>Third, within the formations, we can set up teleportation arrays to allow the transfer of warriors. </p><p></p><p>If one formation is breached, the others can immediately go to the rescue."</p><p></p><p>The eyes of the others lit up.</p><p></p><p>"This is a good idea."</p><p></p><p>"Good kid, you just said you couldn't command, but when you took action, it was a big move."</p><p></p><p>Ye Xiao's expression turned grave. "This is only a stopgap measure, we also need to be wary of another matter. That is, if those Supernal Beasts occupy the other prefectures outside the Nine Prefectures, they will inevitably refine the divine blood, and after devouring the divine blood, they may even create new Supernal Beasts."</p>

        <h1>Chapter 87</h1>
        <div class="content">
            <p>Here is the full English translation of the Chinese excerpt:</p><p></p><p>Each type of cultivation method has a different number and variety of basic cultivation techniques, depending on the type.</p><p></p><p>Take Ye Xiao's previous Tyrant Saber for example - some of its basic techniques focused on cultivating external saber combat skills, some focused on cultivating the essence of the saber, and some focused on cultivating the internal energy of the saber techniques.</p><p></p><p>This is also why the cultivation methods in this world can be directly used to accumulate and improve one's cultivation level.</p><p></p><p>Because the cultivation methods already encompass the internal energy within them.</p><p></p><p>Similarly, the basic techniques of the body tempering system are the same.</p><p></p><p>Like the body tempering technique that Fa Zheng mentioned during the graduation ceremony at the Jianghai Martial Arts Academy, it was an external body tempering technique, similar to the Iron Cloth of Shaolin. Since Fa Zheng obviously couldn't pass down such an advanced technique like the Iron Cloth, he could only teach a lower-level derivative of it.</p><p></p><p>However, for Ye Xiao, as long as it's from the same category, his spiritual sense only needs the basic formula.</p><p></p><p>It evenly spreads the spiritual energy within his body under the skin, defending his entire body.</p><p></p><p>But it also has its own weakness - it needs to leave an opening for the body to absorb spiritual energy.</p><p></p><p>This is the flaw of this technique. After all, if it didn't have any flaws, its level would probably be beyond that of an ordinary technique, reaching the realm of grandmaster.</p><p></p><p>The other body tempering techniques Ye Xiao cultivates strengthen the five viscera and six bowels, the four limbs' attack points, and the mind.</p><p></p><p>The Golden Bell Cover is an inner door technique of the body tempering system that focuses on cultivating internal energy.</p><p></p><p>After cultivating this technique, he can break through the opening that needs to be left when using techniques like the Iron Cloth.</p><p></p><p>It can be said to complement the shortcomings of the Iron Cloth and other basic techniques.</p><p></p><p>Moreover, the Golden Bell Cover is a grandmaster-level technique! Although Ye Xiao only needs the basic formula, Elder Fa Zheng has truly been very good to him.</p><p></p><p>This technique is considered excellent even on a national scale - at the Shaolin Martial Arts Academy, only professors and above would have the chance to learn it.</p><p></p><p>Ye Xiao had the Golden Bell Cover recorded in the Golden Book and quickly began cultivating it, while he himself lay on the sofa snacking on melon seeds.</p><p></p><p>By late at night, the cultivation should be complete, and then he can proceed with the fusion.</p><p></p><p>But just then, he suddenly sensed some disturbance outside.</p><p></p><p>A sweep with his Profound Heavenly Might and he understood.</p><p></p><p>"Illusion Glazed Jade."</p><p></p><p>He kicked the little butt of Illusion Glazed Jade, who was curled up asleep in the other corner of the sofa. "Don't make a fuss, I'm trying to get some rest."</p><p></p><p>Illusion Glazed Jade grumbled and turned over, and Ye Xiao kicked her little butt again.</p><p></p><p>"Do you want to eat fresh meat buns tomorrow morning?"</p><p></p><p>"No! I'm trying to sleep!"</p><p></p><p>"How about crab roe soup buns?"</p><p></p><p>"No! I'm trying to sleep!"</p><p></p><p>"One fresh meat bun and one crab roe soup bun."</p><p></p><p>Illusion Glazed Jade suddenly sat up on the sofa.</p><p></p><p>"What's going on? I'm really sleepy, hurry up and deal with it."</p><p></p><p>"There are a few mice outside, you go take care of them. Once you're done, you can continue sleeping."</p><p></p><p>"What about the buns?"</p><p></p><p>"I'll buy them in the morning."</p><p></p><p>"Alright, give me a minute."</p><p></p><p>Ye Xiao continued snacking on melon seeds as Illusion Glazed Jade transformed into a cat and slipped out through the slightly opened door.</p><p></p><p>Outside the small courtyard, a few beast spirits quietly surrounded the area, hiding in the grass and staring intently at the courtyard.</p><p></p><p>"So this is the dog lackey's little courtyard."</p><p></p><p>"It's all that dog lackey's fault. If he hadn't led that old bald donkey, we wouldn't have lost so many of our brothers."</p><p></p><p>"Everyone get ready, quick and decisive, so we don't get discovered by other humans. Once we get in, Niu Er, lock the legs; Yang Mie, lock the arms; Toad, get the neck."</p><p></p><p>Here is the full English translation of the Chinese excerpt:</p><p></p><p>"Sister Thirteen is responsible for covering the mouth."</p><p></p><p>"What if he bites me? What do I do?"</p><p></p><p>"Your skin is thick."</p><p></p><p>"But it will still hurt if he bites me!"</p><p></p><p>"Sit on his face, and if he tries to bite you, just pee in his mouth."</p><p></p><p>Sister Toad Thirteen's eyes lit up, and her body started trembling excitedly.</p><p></p><p>"I can't hold it anymore, I really need to pee now."</p><p></p><p>"Hold it! Hold it until it's more concentrated and yellow! Charge..."</p><p></p><p>Before the words could finish, the air suddenly fell silent.</p><p></p><p>Niu Er quietly spoke up:</p><p></p><p>"Where's Niu Da?"</p><p></p><p>"I don't know, did he rush in there?"</p><p></p><p>"No, his speed isn't that fast..."</p><p></p><p>The air fell silent again.</p><p></p><p>"Sister Toad Thirteen? Toad, where did you go?"</p><p></p><p>Niu Er and Yang Mie looked at each other, gulping down their saliva, both seeing the fear in the other's eyes.</p><p></p><p>"Run!"</p><p></p><p>Yang Mie shouted, turning and running. Niu Er didn't dare to be careless either, immediately turning and rushing in the other direction.</p><p></p><p>But as soon as he started moving, a huge force attacked him from behind, knocking him to the ground.</p><p></p><p>Boom! Pain shot through his back, and Niu Er glanced around, his eyes filled with terror.</p><p></p><p>The fleeing Yang Mie had already been killed, the fear frozen in his eyes.</p><p></p><p>A deadly pressure came from behind him. Mustering his courage, Niu Er slowly turned his head to see what had killed them. But to his dismay, all he saw was a sharp claw, growing larger and larger in his vision.</p><p></p><p>After dealing with a few spirit beasts, Huan Liuli licked her claws and sighed softly.</p><p></p><p>"Ah, ever since I followed Ye Xiao, the treatment at home has just been getting worse and worse. Before, I could just steal as many steamed buns as I wanted to eat. Now, I even have to do chores to get a single steamed bun."</p><p></p><p>As the words left her mouth, she suddenly felt a powerful fluctuation coming from the small courtyard.</p><p></p><p>This fluctuation was something ordinary people couldn't detect, but Huan Liuli, who had a master-servant contract with Ye Xiao, could sense it clearly.</p><p></p><p>This made her frown.</p><p></p><p>"You've got to be kidding me? This guy has gotten stronger again? I just broke through to the Second Realm of the Grandmaster, and I still haven't caught up to him, and now he's broken through again? Does he not want me to live?"</p><p></p><p>After a moment, her gaze regained its determination.</p><p></p><p>"Hmph! So what if he gets stronger? I'll get stronger too! It's just a matter of time before I surpass him. I've decided, I'll be his servant for the next three hundred years, and then I'll turn the tables and make him my pet!"</p><p></p><p>In the living room, Ye Xiao was indeed in the midst of a fusion.</p><p></p><p>After the Golden Bell Covering reached the Great Perfection Realm, he immediately began the fusion.</p><p></p><p>Since Huan Liuli was outside, he didn't need to worry.</p><p></p><p>The fusion of the cultivation technique, the golden light shining brightly.</p><p></p><p>Stone! More! Bow! Although! Long! Rice! And! Old!</p><p></p><p>As always, each page would reveal a golden character, which would then fuse into a single, top-tier cultivation technique.</p><p></p><p>The Indestructible Divine Skill!</p><p></p><p>Success! "It's actually the Indestructible Divine Skill, how powerful!"</p><p></p><p>This is a new chapter. Thank you to readers Yayun, 20181204200731883, and no for your support and donations. I appreciate it greatly.</p><p></p><p>I also noticed some readers saying the plot seems repetitive later on.</p><p></p><p>In reality, this is just a story about an ordinary person in a small city constantly growing stronger. It's not overly action-packed, so there won't be as many map openings or other such events.</p><p></p><p>You can think of it as the story of a regular city dweller continuously becoming more powerful.</p><p></p><p>(End of this chapter)</p>

        <h1>Chapter 180</h1>
        <div class="content">
            <p>Here is the full English translation of the Chinese excerpt:</p><p></p><p>After Ye Xiao uttered those two words, his aura began to rise, exuding a powerful pressure as he forcefully bore down on the other party.</p><p></p><p>The palpable killing intent caused both of them to tremble.</p><p></p><p>"A human race, a powerful expert of the Divine Sect! Such a young Divine Sect expert!"</p><p></p><p>It was no wonder they were so shocked.</p><p></p><p>Based on Ye Xiao's youthful appearance, he was extremely young, even for a martial artist who could prolong their lifespan. He was definitely under the age of thirty.</p><p></p><p>The Sect Master couldn't help but lick her lips, her gaze towards Ye Xiao filled with greed. </p><p></p><p>Such a young, handsome, and powerful young man - if she could recruit him, she could do whatever she pleased with him. Ye Xiao's looks were several levels above the Right Protector.</p><p></p><p>It was like heaven and earth.</p><p></p><p>"Little brother, what has you so riled up? Come to Sister's embrace and let her soothe your anger."</p><p></p><p>But as soon as the words left her mouth, a terrifying pressure formed a massive sword beam above Ye Xiao's head, instantly appearing before her.</p><p></p><p>The destructive power emanating from that sword beam caused the Sect Master's pupils to constrict.</p><p></p><p>In the next moment, the Right Protector beside her hastily pushed her away.</p><p></p><p>"Sect Master, be careful!"</p><p></p><p>But just as he pushed the Sect Master away, he was split into two by Ye Xiao's sword beam, his soul taken along with his body.</p><p></p><p>Boom! The sword beam exploded, the violent shockwave cutting through the air, causing the Sect Master of the Beast God Alliance to shudder, fully awakening.</p><p></p><p>She realized that Ye Xiao had come purely to kill her.</p><p></p><p>Not daring to be careless, after witnessing Ye Xiao's terrifying attack, she instantly transformed into a teal beam of light and fled.</p><p></p><p>"What a powerful human expert! This human expert, where did he come from? So young, yet so strong! </p><p>A single sword beam was able to instantly kill a Xiantian Seventh-Grade Right Protector, a level I haven't even reached yet.</p><p>Damn it! But at least I managed to escape quickly, he shouldn't be able to catch up to me for now, I'll just hide for a bit."</p><p></p><p>But just then, the clouds in the sky suddenly began to churn, gradually forming a massive Buddha figure.</p><p></p><p>The Sect Master's pupils constricted.</p><p></p><p>So fast!</p><p></p><p>How was this possible?</p><p></p><p>How could his speed be so fast?</p><p></p><p>She had been the one to flee first, and she had used the mighty Imperial Art-level movement technique, her speed far exceeding that of Sect Masters.</p><p></p><p>But even with her speed, he had still managed to get in front of her.</p><p></p><p>Could it be that there was more than one of them? However, when the giant Buddha figure in the sky formed and Ye Xiao's figure appeared on its chest, it immediately shattered her illusion.</p><p></p><p>It was just one person!</p><p></p><p>Now trying to run away was too late to change direction.</p><p></p><p>Moreover, with his speed, she likely wouldn't be able to escape again.</p><p></p><p>I'll have to fight him head-on!</p><p></p><p>The Sect Master gritted her teeth, clenching her fist and rushing straight towards Ye Xiao's face.</p><p></p><p>Ye Xiao remained calm, raising one hand in a palm strike.</p><p></p><p>Boom! A massive golden Buddha seal instantly descended upon the Sect Master, enveloping her attack.</p><p></p><p>"No!"</p><p></p><p>The Sect Master's pupils constricted, her entire body's hairs standing on end.</p><p></p><p>The power of Ye Xiao's Tathagata Divine Palm exuded an extremely forceful and yang energy, something she could not resist.</p><p></p><p>She could even feel the oppressive aura of death emanating from the Tathagata Divine Palm.</p><p></p><p>Not daring to be careless, she maintained her punching stance and immediately underwent a beastly transformation, fully converting to the bloodline of a celestial beast - a massive, fiery red fox.</p><p></p><p>Accompanying the transformation, her strength began to surge unceasingly.</p><p></p><p>Finally, her fist and Ye Xiao's Tathagata Divine Palm collided.</p><p></p><p>Boom! Upon the clash of fist and palm, a massive shockwave instantly radiated out in all 360 degrees, scattering the clouds in the sky and revealing a clear starry expanse, as if wiping a pane of glass.</p><p></p><p>The tremendous impact force made the Sect Master feel like her internal organs were about to be displaced.</p><p></p><p>But fortunately, she managed to withstand it.</p><p></p><p>Relying on the enhanced physique and combat power from her beastly transformation, she had actually managed to block Ye Xiao's palm strike! While her body was in pain and her bones were trembling, she had at least withstood the blow.</p><p></p><p>As long as she wasn't completely crushed, she still had a chance to survive.</p><p></p><p>Once the force of that attack dissipated, she would immediately unleash an illusion technique and then flee.</p><p></p><p>In the sky, how could Ye Xiao not see through her thoughts? A mocking and icy smile appeared on the corner of his mouth as he clenched his fist again.</p><p></p><p>Great Nirvana Fist!</p><p></p><p>This punch, as it fell, caused the heavens and earth to tremble, the clouds all retreating!</p><p></p><p>The terrifying cosmic force seemed to have been concentrated into this one strike.</p><p></p><p>The sheer power was so overwhelming that the Sect Master below couldn't help but hold her breath, her eyes widening in shock.</p><p></p><p>Here is the full English translation of the Chinese excerpt:</p><p></p><p>This punch! So powerful!</p><p></p><p>It's over!</p><p></p><p>The moment this thought arose, Ye Xiao's Great Nirvana Fist landed on the Buddha Palm. </p><p></p><p>The combination of the Great Nirvana Fist and the Buddha Palm, the combined power directly caused the Demonic Beast Alliance's Patriarch to completely collapse.</p><p></p><p>Crack! Crack! Boom! Her beast-transformed arms were mercilessly shattered, inch by inch, then exploded into a bloody mist.</p><p></p><p>The power of the Buddha Palm was finally imprinted ruthlessly on her chest, directly slamming her into the ground.</p><p></p><p>The earth trembled violently, and due to the sheer force, the tremors radiated outwards, waking up countless citizens of Nanshan City.</p><p></p><p>"What's happening? Is it an earthquake?"</p><p></p><p>"Quick, run! It's an earthquake!"</p><p></p><p>"Where's my darling? Ah, I don't have any clothes on."</p><p></p><p>On the ground, the Demonic Beast Alliance Patriarch had become a pile of mud. Even the fur of her giant fox form had been flattened.</p><p></p><p>A massive Buddha Palm print appeared on the ground, over 10,000 meters in diameter and 100 meters deep! </p><p></p><p>Viewed from the sky above, it was awe-inspiring, making one's whole body break out in cold sweat, like electric currents running through the body, causing goosebumps.</p><p></p><p>But her innate Eighth-Grade powerful life force allowed her to cling to her last breath.</p><p></p><p>"Who are you?"</p><p></p><p>She couldn't help but struggle and utter these words.</p><p></p><p>Her death was inevitable, and she had accepted her fate, but she really wanted to know who this person was.</p><p></p><p>Unfortunately, the only response she received was a terrifying sword beam.</p><p></p><p>Boom! In an instant, that earth-shattering power directly and mercilessly destroyed her.</p><p></p><p>Ye Xiao didn't bother with any unnecessary actions.</p><p></p><p>At this time, several powerful forces were rapidly converging on this location, as the battle between the two had been too strong and caused too much commotion, attracting the attention of many.</p><p></p><p>Ye Xiao waved his hand, taking the Demonic Beast Alliance Patriarch's storage ring, and used the Divine Intent Technique to disappear from the scene instantly.</p><p></p><p>He didn't take the red fox fur, as the opponent was not a true star beast, but a half-beast person. Strictly speaking, she still had half human blood in her, so Ye Xiao felt a bit uncomfortable about taking her fox fur.</p><p></p><p>As soon as he left, a moment later, several beams of light rapidly arrived at the site.</p><p></p><p>When they saw the scene below, everyone couldn't help but have their pupils constrict, and a chill ran down their spines.</p><p></p><p>"Such a powerful technique! This move is probably not weaker than a Divine Patriarch, and is close to the peak of Ninth-Grade Innate realm!"</p><p></p><p>"And this palm technique, I've never seen it before. What sect does this palm art belong to?"</p><p></p><p>"If I'm not mistaken, this should be the long-lost Buddha Palm of the Shaolin Temple!"</p><p></p><p>"The Buddha Palm? The most powerful martial art of the Shaolin Temple, the most rigid and yang technique?"</p><p></p><p>"Correct!"</p><p></p><p>"But the Buddha Palm has been lost for hundreds of years, how could it suddenly appear?"</p><p></p><p>"Who knows? Perhaps it was displayed by some hidden master."</p><p></p><p>At this time, someone had already descended into the palm print to examine the red fox fur.</p><p></p><p>"This fox's bloodline is not pure, it's not a true star beast, but a half-beast person! And it's an Eighth-Grade Innate half-beast person! Could it be the notorious Demonic Beast Alliance Patriarch, Naluo Huohu?"</p><p></p><p>"Naluo Huohu? My goodness, she is one of the most infamous evil demons in the Nine Realms, having slaughtered countless living beings. </p><p></p><p>The entire Nine Realms has been trying to capture her for years, but she is extremely powerful and has many imperial arts. Countless elite warriors have been lost in the pursuit, yet she has never been found.</p><p></p><p>Unexpectedly, she was killed here today?"</p><p></p><p>"The one who could annihilate the extremely powerful and cunning Naluo Huohu, this senior must be extraordinary! Truly remarkable!"</p><p></p><p>"Quickly, report this matter to the higher-ups, this is too big of an incident, beyond our control."</p><p></p><p>Time quickly passed to the next day, but the secret of last night's events had not been revealed.</p><p></p><p>The Demonic Beast Alliance's affairs were inherently confidential, not suitable for widespread reporting, as that would only cause chaos.</p><p></p><p>After returning home, Ye Xiao directly lay on the bed and played with his phone, allowing the Golden Book to quietly continue cultivating the Dharma Sutra.</p><p></p><p>At this point, all the other techniques had already been cultivated to the Great Perfection realm, and were fully mastered during his battle.</p><p></p><p>However, they still did not show any signs of fusion, clearly indicating that something was still missing.</p><p></p><p>But it was reassuring that the Golden Book had begun to emit a faint golden glow.</p><p></p><p>This meant that it only lacked one more fundamental technique to complete the fusion.</p><p></p><p>Wondering what kind of technique it would fuse into next.</p><p></p><p>When Ye Xiao opened his phone, he was immediately dumbfounded.</p><p></p><p>What's going on? There is an Imperial Bloodline in the Nine Realms, and it's in Jianghai City? Who is it?</p><p></p><p>Six updates, 18,000 words.</p><p></p><p>Typing for too long without a break, my eyes are starting to blur, and I can't even see the screen clearly within half a meter.</p><p></p><p>(End of this chapter)</p>

        <h1>Chapter 66</h1>
        <div class="content">
            <p>Here is the full English translation of the Chinese excerpt:</p><p></p><p>A night had passed, and early the next morning, Ye Xiao was on his way to work, carrying the iron sword to sell at the materials store.</p><p></p><p>"Oh, you're the customer from yesterday, aren't you? You've already mastered it so quickly?" </p><p></p><p>The store owner recognized Ye Xiao and took the precious sword from his hand.</p><p></p><p>"What a fine sword!"</p><p></p><p>The moment he laid eyes on the sword, he couldn't help but exclaim in amazement. </p><p></p><p>This sword could already be considered a superior-grade weapon.</p><p></p><p>Weapons, elixirs, and cultivation techniques are all divided into ordinary, superior, and master levels.</p><p></p><p>Ye Xiao did not have the advanced forging technique, only a few basic forging skills that he had picked up in his spare time while practicing his body cultivation. Yet, with just over a thousand taels of raw iron, he was able to forge a superior-grade sword, which was quite impressive.</p><p></p><p>"Young man, I won't deceive you. If you were to sell this sword online, it would be worth at least three to four thousand. Even at an auction house or weapon shop, they'd give you two to three thousand. But here with me, the most I can give you is two thousand six hundred. </p><p></p><p>Since this isn't my specialty, I'd have to go through the trouble of reselling it."</p><p></p><p>"Alright, but in the future, you'll have to give me a better price on materials."</p><p></p><p>"Okay, okay, no problem."</p><p></p><p>The store owner quickly transferred the money to Ye Xiao, who then left the materials store, buying some breakfast to eat on the way.</p><p></p><p>Selling it online would be too much of a hassle, and as a laidback person, Ye Xiao really couldn't be bothered. </p><p></p><p>The return rate was already quite high, reaching 2.6 times his investment. </p><p></p><p>And this was with his current limited forging skills. If his skills improved, even a thousand taels of raw iron might be able to produce a true superior-grade weapon.</p><p></p><p>As for master-grade, that was out of the question. No matter how skilled Ye Xiao became, the law of conservation of energy would not allow him to forge a master-grade weapon from just a thousand taels of raw iron.</p><p></p><p>He also didn't plan to forge weapons every day. Enjoying it as a hobby was one thing, but treating it like a job would be another. </p><p></p><p>It's like a woman finding one boyfriend - that's a relationship. But finding a hundred boyfriends - that's a job.</p><p></p><p>The nature is completely different.</p><p></p><p>Occasionally indulging in it to earn some extra cash for a nice meal, why not? But Ye Xiao wasn't really that interested in making money.</p><p></p><p>Wealth is external, as long as there's enough. If he really wanted to get rich, he had too many methods - robbing a bank, searching for gold mines, seducing wealthy women, or even using mystical techniques to find money on the street.</p><p></p><p>Reborn into this world, Ye Xiao only wanted to enjoy life at a leisurely pace, getting a little stronger every day, content and carefree.</p><p></p><p>Arriving at the library, Ning Yuhen had also returned, still visibly upset about yesterday's events, endlessly cursing the Chengzhou Manor. </p><p></p><p>He naturally had no idea about the mysterious "Mr. Zhao" and could only vent his anger towards Dutian Yu.</p><p></p><p>Ye Xiao had no intention of defending Dutian Yu. A few curses were harmless.</p><p></p><p>If he were to reveal that the mastermind was actually Mr. Zhao, Ning Yuhen would probably bombard him with a barrage of questions, and Ye Xiao didn't know how to respond.</p><p></p><p>However, Ning Yuhen's character was indeed quite admirable. Knowing that he had been saved by a powerful figure, he spoke up righteously, which made Ye Xiao's previous care for him worthwhile.</p><p></p><p>Seeing that Ye Xiao was not very interested, Ning Yuhen went to vent to another librarian, leaving Ye Xiao in peace to continue reading.</p><p></p><p>Today, he would return to his regular cultivation of body techniques. Weapons were external, he could only cultivate them as a side practice, not the main focus.</p><p></p><p>He originally only had two basic body cultivation techniques, but with his recent studies...</p><p></p><p>Here is the full English translation of the Chinese excerpt:</p><p></p><p>The books, I've obtained two more, so now I have a total of four basic body techniques.</p><p></p><p>The basic body techniques only provide about a 20% increase in speed.</p><p></p><p>Although it's only 20%, for expert combatants, it's an extremely valuable asset. It means that while others move 5 meters, you can move 1 meter more.</p><p></p><p>As the saying goes, "In the martial arts, only the unyielding is unbreakable, only the swift is undefeatable!"</p><p></p><p>But speaking of which, if the speed gets too fast, won't the skin get scraped? </p><p></p><p>After all, frictional resistance is an issue that can't be ignored.</p><p></p><p>Or should I use qi to protect the body?</p><p></p><p>But even if I use qi to protect the body, won't there still be friction-induced heat? Won't the high temperature and pressure cause the bodily fluids to suddenly spray out? From the current cultivation methods, there seems to be a slight mention of this.</p><p></p><p>To practice the body techniques, I need to strengthen my physical fitness a bit.</p><p></p><p>To be able to use the high speeds, I must be tough enough.</p><p></p><p>This makes Ye Xiao sigh, "Indeed, to become a qualified martial artist, one must develop comprehensively in morality, intelligence, physique, and appearance."</p><p></p><p>Specializing in one area at the expense of others will eventually prove fatal.</p><p></p><p>However, he hasn't cultivated much in the body tempering techniques, mainly because he has a concern.</p><p></p><p>After body tempering, although it will increase the explosive power of the body, it will also increase the body's hardness.</p><p></p><p>If my body becomes as hard as steel, what then? Although I'm single right now, who knows when I might meet someone I have feelings for - it's hard to say.</p><p></p><p>At that time, am I going to stab them with my steel body?</p><p></p><p>Even though I've learned the補天術(補天Technique), that would be too much, right? Constantly creating wounds and then repairing them, creating wounds and then repairing them? Ugh, just thinking about that scene is terrifying.</p><p></p><p>The book clearly writes about the adverse consequences of body tempering techniques.</p><p></p><p>But the example is not a man, but a woman.</p><p></p><p>Apparently, after mastering the body tempering, she became a renowned master, invincible on the battlefield, her iron fists able to crush the heads of beast-like creatures as easily as cracking walnuts with a hammer.</p><p></p><p>But because of this, her body became as hard as steel, and even until now, she's still single.</p><p></p><p>Unacceptable, unacceptable.</p><p></p><p>It's better to take the time to fully understand it before learning the body tempering techniques.</p><p></p><p>For now, having a basic foundation in the body tempering techniques is enough to barely support the body techniques.</p><p></p><p>After work tonight, it's time for Ning Yuhen's treat.</p><p></p><p>During work, he mentioned that he would take me to an amazing restaurant in Jianghai City.</p><p></p><p>Because of this, I didn't have lunch today.</p><p></p><p>It's not to save money, but simply because I don't want to ruin my appetite for the delicious food.</p><p></p><p>Sometimes, I don't know why, when others treat me, the food tastes even better, but when I pay for it myself, after a couple times, it becomes bland.</p><p></p><p>To Ye Xiao's surprise, Ning Yuhen took him to the Shuiyue Xuan in Jianghai City.</p><p></p><p>He's heard that this place is the best ethnic specialty restaurant in Jianghai City, with the most renowned cuisines from all over the Nine Provinces.</p><p></p><p>But the prices are also very expensive. </p><p></p><p>Supposedly, you need to spend 10,000 per person to be full. Ye Xiao looked at his own stomach, then at the Jade Cat on his shoulder.</p><p></p><p>Hmm, eating a little less, spending 3-5,000 should be enough, can't be too excessive.</p><p></p><p>This is the second update, please support me.</p><p></p><p>Thank you to the readers Mu Zi Da Mao, 20181228191317188, and Xiao Yao Feng Shi for your donations, I'm deeply grateful.</p><p></p><p>(This chapter is complete)</p>

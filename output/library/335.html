        <h1>Chapter 335</h1>
        <div class="content">
            <p>Here is the full English translation of the Chinese excerpt:</p><p></p><p>After finishing planting all these heavenly treasures, Ye Xiao scanned through the newly obtained star beasts and extracted new imperial techniques from their star cores to supplement the requirements of his Golden Book.</p><p></p><p>Ultimately, he found four imperial techniques from these star beasts that could be recorded into the divine soul of the Golden Book.</p><p></p><p>There was no other choice, as the attack methods of these star beasts were mainly based on the most common sword techniques, claw techniques, fist techniques, and blade techniques.</p><p></p><p>The vast majority were repetitive.</p><p></p><p>The divine techniques of the Golden Book only require three techniques to be fused into one, and he already possessed several divine techniques, so there were not many left to synthesize.</p><p></p><p>However, even so, this was still a huge harvest.</p><p></p><p>The four imperial techniques were: Asura's Three Blades - an increasingly tyrannical blade technique filled with a bloodthirsty aura, surpassing even the Tyrannical Blade; Frenzied Thunder Refining Technique - a faster and more violent alchemy technique, but with higher cultivation requirements due to its immense consumption; Sovereign Trampling the Rivers and Mountains - an unexpected leg technique that could exert supreme pressure to immobilize enemies, unlike his previous leg techniques that could inflict massive destructive damage; and the Imperial Array - Brilliant Luo Imperial Array, which could move independently and possess a certain degree of self-awareness.</p><p></p><p>This was Ye Xiao's fourth array technique, in addition to the Heaven-Traversing Causal Array, the Vast Origin Grand Array, and the Earth Desolation Heaven Arrayed Formation.</p><p></p><p>However, the fusion of arrays was different from the fusion of techniques. It required more arrays, and four were not enough. He would need to find another imperial array of a different attribute in the future to complete the fusion.</p><p></p><p>Even so, he had not wasted his time last night. Not only had he resolved the issue of the cultivation base, but he had also obtained several excellent techniques, and he could even synthesize a divine-level leg technique.</p><p></p><p>Perfect!</p><p></p><p>The next morning, as Ye Xiao emerged from the jade seal, he encountered Ning Yuhen and Youwei at the door.</p><p></p><p>Ning Yuhen informed Ye Xiao that the human race had gathered the backing of several major divine clans, and it would be safer for Ye Xiao to return to the Silver Fox Valley for the time being, as Ning Yuhen would not be able to protect him here. Ye Xiao instructed Ning Yuhen to notify the Silver Fox Valley to also hide and avoid the spotlight, and to never reveal Ye Xiao's identity, as it could cause him great trouble.</p><p></p><p>Ning Yuhen promised to keep Ye Xiao's identity a secret and accepted the heavenly treasures Ye Xiao gave him before departing.</p><p></p><p>After sending off Ning Yuhen, Ye Xiao returned to the library to continue his studies. Meanwhile, a powerful aura began to emerge in the starry sky, causing the star beasts to tremble in fear, sensing that the one who had refined the divine blood of hundreds of billions of the human race was now incredibly formidable, capable of destroying them with a single punch.</p><p></p><p>Here is the full English translation of the Chinese excerpt:</p><p></p><p>"His aura can be said to be the most powerful in the entire history of the starry sky in the past few hundred years!"</p><p></p><p>"Now he is no longer ranked second on the Starry Sky Rankings, but is the true number one! Even the Sage Emperor of the Human Realm would not be able to defeat him in a one-on-one battle."</p><p></p><p>"It's settled! This time it's definitely settled. The Star Beast Army has been deployed, and as long as he defeats that Human Realm cultivator, all the Star Beast Army will rush up and subdue the Nine States of the Human Realm before the various Deity Clan forces arrive. By then, capturing the descendants of the Xuanyuan Clan will be an absolute great merit."</p><p></p><p>As he spoke, that figure had already started flying towards the ground. At this time, the defensive barrier that had been established in the Human Realm for thousands of years was already in ruins. That aura descended directly, and there was still an intact barrier guarding the front.</p><p></p><p>But he did not descend through the gaps on the side, but directly struck the barrier.</p><p></p><p>Boom! Accompanied by a heaven-shaking roar, a huge hole was blown open on the barrier, with lightning raging within and smoke and dust billowing, while that figure descended to the mortal world in a crushing manner.</p><p></p><p>On the other side, Ye Xiao was reading books in the library when the Sage Emperor came to find him.</p><p></p><p>"Ye Xiao, you actually have the leisure and elegance to be reading books here."</p><p></p><p>Ye Xiao shrugged.</p><p></p><p>"What else can I do if not read books?"</p><p></p><p>His way of cultivating and growing stronger was to constantly read books, extract powerful cultivation methods from them, absorb them into his divine soul, and then break through.</p><p></p><p>"Don't be in a hurry to read books, I have something to tell you."</p><p></p><p>"Please go ahead, Senior."</p><p></p><p>The Sage Emperor took a deep breath, his face slightly solemn:</p><p></p><p>"As you know, with the descent of the Xuanyuan Deity Clan this time, none of us know what the situation will be like.</p><p></p><p>But one thing I can confirm is that after they arrive, they will definitely send high-level members to take over the Nine States.</p><p></p><p>We, the descendants of the Xuanyuan Clan, are a branch of the Xuanyuan Deity Clan, and will inevitably be under the control of the Xuanyuan Deity Clan.</p><p></p><p>I have decided that I, along with the Azure Dragon and others, will represent the entire Human Realm to complete the handover to them.</p><p></p><p>But even so, we have never had any contact with the Xuanyuan Deity Clan, so we don't know what their temperament is like, whether it is brutal, arrogant, or something else.</p><p></p><p>So I want to ask you, if, I say if, the Xuanyuan Deity Clan is not friendly to the Human Realm, can you take away some of the Nine States' talents and leave a little bloodline for our branch of the Xuanyuan descendants?"</p><p></p><p>Ye Xiao nodded.</p><p></p><p>"But what can I use to take them away?"</p><p></p><p>"The Jade Talisman! Isn't the Jade Talisman a spatial storage treasure? Its spatial capacity is large enough for you to take away many people."</p><p></p><p>Ye Xiao: "(_..)!"</p><p></p><p>"What's wrong? Is there a problem with the Jade Talisman?"</p><p></p><p>"Well, it's not that, it's just that I've kept a few things in it."</p><p></p><p>"Oh, that's no problem. Keeping a few things in it, the space there is so large. By the way, what have you kept in it?"</p><p></p><p>Ye Xiao: "Just some Deity Clan Star Beasts, Divine Beasts, and Super Divine Beasts that I caught before."</p><p></p><p>The Sage Emperor: "(˙灬˙)!"</p><p></p><p>"You're so powerful, does your mother know about this?"</p><p></p><p>"If she were still alive, she should know."</p><p></p><p>The Sage Emperor rubbed his brow.</p><p></p><p>"Only you would be so abnormal! Being able to keep those things. But it doesn't matter, it may not be necessary for you to lead people to escape. It's just a guess.</p><p></p><p>If such an event really happens, you can take as many as possible."</p><p></p><p>Ye Xiao nodded.</p><p></p><p>"By the way, don't we know anything about the situation of the Deity Clan?"</p><p></p><p>The Sage Emperor shook his head.</p><p></p><p>"No! Since the ancestors' demise, it's been thousands of years. Thousands of years is enough to wear away many things. Even the handwritten notes left by the ancestors, we don't know where they've been lost."</p><p></p><p>"Then haven't you tried to contact the outside world and try to understand something about the Deity Clan?"</p><p></p><p>The Sage Emperor shook his head and smiled bitterly.</p><p></p><p>"It's not that easy? The starry sky is really too vast. With our current level and means, we haven't been able to break through to distant places.</p><p></p><p>In the starry sky, there are dangers everywhere, and it's not necessarily safer than here. However..."</p><p></p><p>"However what?"</p><p></p><p>Ye Xiao caught the unusual change in his tone, which had become more solemn.</p><p></p><p>"However, there was a person in history who once led a group and broke through the Star Beast blockade, entering the starry sky.</p><p></p><p>He was the one who was considered to have the most hope of succeeding the ancestors' mission before you.</p><p></p><p>But he said that the ancestors were just a speck of dust in the Xuanyuan Deity Clan, and the ancestors' vision was too small, which was why they guarded this small world.</p><p></p><p>He did not go to the Emperor's Stele, but merely by closing his eyes and comprehending, he grasped the divine techniques in the Xuanyuan Deity Blood!</p><p></p><p>He is the one with the fastest cultivation speed, the strongest strength, the most mysterious, and the most arrogant in the history of the Nine States."</p><p></p><p>"Who is it?"</p><p></p><p>"Ancestor Dragon!"</p>

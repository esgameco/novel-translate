        <h1>Chapter 286</h1>
        <div class="content">
            <p>Here is the full English translation of the Chinese excerpt:</p><p></p><p>The eleven Monarch Realm experts stared intently at Jiang Chen, their eyes gleaming with a cold light.</p><p></p><p>"Venerable Xuanwu, do you really want to go to war?"</p><p></p><p>"I never said I wanted to go to war! You eleven came to me first, it's not me, Jiang Chen, who provoked this."</p><p></p><p>"You! You've robbed us of the seventeen dragon veins in the West, do you still have any sense of reason?"</p><p></p><p>"Who said those seventeen dragon veins belong to you? The ones who took them from you were the Star Beasts. Our dragon veins were snatched from the Star Beasts, if you want them, go ask the Star Beasts. Don't keep nagging here."</p><p></p><p>"Jiang Chen, you've gone too far!"</p><p></p><p>The eleven Monarch Realm experts were completely enraged, and the auras of all the Monarch Realm experts erupted, colliding head-on with the might of Venerable Xuanwu Jiang Chen.</p><p></p><p>Boom! In an instant, the sea surface was turbulent, with deafening explosions and countless towering waves surging hundreds of meters high!</p><p></p><p>With the support of the eleven Monarch Realm experts, even Venerable Xuanwu Jiang Chen, the second-ranked expert on the World Dragon Rankings, could not easily resist.</p><p></p><p>The moment their auras clashed, his body kept retreating.</p><p></p><p>But he still stood tall and proud.</p><p></p><p>The spirit of a man of the Nine Provinces, even when at a disadvantage, would never retreat or submit.</p><p></p><p>At this moment, a somewhat elegant female voice descended from the sky.</p><p></p><p>"So many people ganging up to bully my big brother Xuanwu, do you think there's no one left in the Nine Provinces?"</p><p></p><p>Accompanying the words was an aura no less powerful than Xuanwu's! This powerful aura plummeted, slamming heavily onto the auras of the eleven Monarch Realm experts, causing the ripples to make the sea surface within a hundred-mile radius tremble.</p><p></p><p>Vast amounts of seawater surged upward like towering water columns.</p><p></p><p>The entire sea surface sank considerably.</p><p></p><p>At the point of collision between the auras, bolts of thunderous lightning erupted.</p><p></p><p>Li Liushui was startled, a hint of joy appearing on his face.</p><p></p><p>"It's Venerable Baihu! Venerable Baihu has arrived. Venerable Xuanwu, our pressure can be greatly reduced now."</p><p></p><p>Xuanwu nodded.</p><p></p><p>"But it's still not enough. Baihu is only ranked second on the Phoenix Rankings, and our combined strength is still not enough to fully resist the auras of those eleven Monarch Realm experts!"</p><p></p><p>After all, those were eleven Monarch Realm experts, and most of them were veteran Monarchs, not like Li Liushui who had just entered the Monarch Realm. The gap in strength between the two sides was still significant.</p><p></p><p>"Two is not enough, I wonder if three will be enough?"</p><p></p><p>Another voice came, and a stunningly beautiful woman in a red dress slowly stepped forth from the east.</p><p></p><p>Her tall figure, fair skin, and a touch of nobility in her appearance, with a pair of alluring phoenix eyes that did not lack in might.</p><p></p><p>With each step, her speed exceeded ten thousand meters, and in the blink of an eye, she had arrived at Venerable Xuanwu's side, despite her unhurried pace.</p><p></p><p>Li Liushui clenched his fists, his face flushed with excitement.</p><p></p><p>Another Venerable! The Fire Talon Zhuque Venerable, one of the Four Venerables of the Nine Provinces! Her cultivation was stronger than Baihu's, and as a fellow practitioner of the Dao of the Sword, Li Liushui had always regarded Fire Talon Zhuque as his goal.</p><p></p><p>With the arrival of the Fire Phoenix, the surrounding sea began to boil, the seawater seemingly evaporating under the high temperature, producing billowing steam.</p><p></p><p>The auras erupted, and the combined might of the three Venerables collided with the eleven Monarch Realm experts.</p><p></p><p>The clash of auras caused the clouds in the sky to flow in reverse, and the sea winds entering this area to come to a halt.</p><p></p><p>The seawater also kept sinking, and the seawater tens of thousands of meters away, under this immense pressure, even began to rise, like a hundred-meter-tall building, far exceeding the level of the Monarch Realm experts.</p><p></p><p>The two sides were in a deadlock, neither willing to back down.</p><p></p><p>On the sidelines, the Sword Saint Li Liushui couldn't help but sigh incessantly in his heart.</p><p></p><p>So powerful! Is this the battle between veteran Monarch Realm experts?</p><p></p><p>It was laughable that he had once regarded the Monarch Realm as his goal, and now that he had reached it, he realized it was only the beginning.</p><p></p><p>He still had a long way to go.</p><p></p><p>In this moment, the Sword Saint Li Liushui's determination in the Dao of the Sword became even more resolute!</p><p></p><p>However, the situation on the battlefield remained in a stalemate.</p><p></p><p>Although the three Venerables were extremely powerful, their strength was ultimately limited.</p><p></p><p>The eleven veteran Monarch Realm experts combined were no easy target either, their strength not to be underestimated.</p><p></p><p>And as the auras of both sides deepened, their powers had reached their limits. If either side retreated first, they would sustain damage.</p><p></p><p>So neither side could retreat, they could only continue to deepen their auras, trying to suppress the other side. Whoever could gain the upper hand first could then seize the opportunity to attack and break through the other's aura.</p><p></p><p>That way, the damage would be inflicted on the opponent.</p><p></p><p>Sword Saint Li Liushui felt his breathing becoming somewhat labored, the clash of fourteen veteran Monarch Realm experts was something he, as a newly entered Monarch, could not fully withstand.</p><p></p><p>It was only thanks to his own cultivation that he had already fully entered the Monarch Realm, otherwise, even as a half-step Monarch, he would have been crushed to a pulp.</p><p></p><p>At this moment, he felt increasingly powerless about his own cultivation.</p><p></p><p>The auras of both sides kept erupting, until they reached a critical point, where the gravitational field within a hundred-mile radius had reached its limit and was about to shatter.</p><p></p><p>Once the gravitational field broke, the energy imbalance would cause all present to be unable to escape unharmed.</p><p></p><p>Here is the full English translation of the Chinese excerpt:</p><p></p><p>In that critical moment, a dragon's roar resounded from the sky, calm yet powerful. In an instant, the gravitational field gathered by the combined might of the fourteen Monarch-realm experts was shattered.</p><p></p><p>All the momentum dissipated like smoke. The sky returned to normal, the clouds continued to drift, and the sea breeze resumed blowing across the surface of the ocean. Everything seemed to have returned to normalcy.</p><p></p><p>Yet at this moment, the hearts of all present were gripped by a chill and an overwhelming sense of dread. The power of their opponent was simply too great, overwhelming them completely.</p><p></p><p>Even the fourteen Monarch-realm experts had been reduced to mere ants in the face of this true powerhouse - a crushing force that dominated all.</p><p></p><p>Some of the Monarch-realm experts even began to tremble slightly.</p><p></p><p>A azure glow slowly descended, carrying the silhouette of a man bearing a long sword on his back. As the azure light faded, a middle-aged man with a square face and long hair, dressed in a plain azure robe, emerged. He looked no different from a Taoist priest or a scholarly gentleman, exuding no obvious aura of threat.</p><p></p><p>Yet no one dared to underestimate him.</p><p></p><p>Some even found themselves unable to meet his gaze directly.</p><p></p><p>Li Liushui clenched his fists, gazing at the man with profound admiration and longing. Was this the Azure Dragon, the number one on the World Dragon Ranking and the leader of the Four Great Sages of the Nine Realms, the Eastern Sword Emperor?</p><p></p><p>How majestic! With a single gesture, he had subdued all present.</p><p></p><p>It must be noted that in addition to him, there were a total of fifteen Monarch-realm experts gathered here - the top fifteen on the World Dragon and Phoenix Rankings, the pinnacle of power in the world.</p><p></p><p>Yet in the face of the Azure Dragon, the number one on the rankings, they had no room for resistance, completely suppressed on the spot.</p><p></p><p>The Azure Dragon, truly worthy of the title of Sword Emperor and the top position on the Dragon Ranking!</p><p></p><p>He descended slowly, hands clasped behind his back, his gaze sweeping across everyone present. A single glance was enough to make the Monarch-realm experts tremble, as if they were being observed by an ancient, colossal beast.</p><p></p><p>"This matter ends here. Is that acceptable?" His few words caused the kings to shudder, wanting to speak but not daring to refute him.</p><p></p><p>However, one among them, gritting his teeth, could not hold back.</p><p></p><p>"Sword Emperor, this matter seems rather unfair. The seventeen dragon veins in the West have almost all fallen into the hands of the East. How can the warriors of the West continue to cultivate? Our martial arts prowess is declining, and if we cannot withstand the star beasts, the East may not be able to remain unscathed either."</p><p></p><p>The speaker was the third-ranked Monarch-realm expert on the World Dragon Ranking, the peak expert of the Western continent, Thunder Kan.</p><p></p><p>Knowing that if he did not speak up, the seventeen dragon veins would all fall into the East's hands, a loss too great for the West to bear, he felt compelled to act.</p><p></p><p>As the third-ranked on the Dragon Ranking, surely the Sword Emperor Azure Dragon would at least give him a chance to speak, right?</p><p></p><p>The Azure Dragon glanced at him, and in the next instant, a sword beam shot up into the sky, illuminating the entire sea area. In the blink of an eye, Thunder Kan was cleaved in two, killed instantly.</p><p></p><p>A ruthless, overwhelming display of power.</p><p></p><p>All the Monarch-realm experts present shuddered involuntarily. Just for speaking a few words, he had been directly executed by the other party. This was completely unreasonable!</p><p></p><p>But the Azure Dragon had the power to be unreasonable. Who dared to say a word against him?</p><p></p><p>The Azure Dragon swept his gaze across the crowd and spoke again, "In the past, the various realms have repeatedly brought star beasts into the Nine Realms. This account has not yet been settled. If we were to settle it, everyone present would have to die!"</p><p></p><p>The group shuddered once more.</p><p></p><p>Xuanwu sneered, "A bunch of fools. The Azure Dragon Sword Emperor has refrained from acting against you Westerners because he does not wish to see you suffer too greatly. Yet you still think you are worthy? Refusing to drink the wine, yet demanding to be punished. A group of brainless idiots, constantly barking and howling.</p><p></p><p>Let me tell you the truth - those seventeen dragon veins will never be returned. If you are not satisfied, come and take them yourselves. But be prepared to pay the price."</p>

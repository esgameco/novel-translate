        <h1>Chapter 169</h1>
        <div class="content">
            <p>Here is the full English translation of the Chinese excerpt:</p><p></p><p>There was a lot of discussion and chatter about Ye Xiao everywhere.</p><p></p><p>Many netizens, because the fierce battle between Liu Chengxun and Ye Xiao had just caused a powerful electromagnetic interference, were unable to see Ye Xiao's stunning and brilliant sword strike. At this moment, they were all asking on the screen:</p><p></p><p>"What happened? Who won in the end? Was it Liu Chengxun or the Sword Immortal?"</p><p></p><p>"The Sword Immortal won, our Jiuzhou's Sword Immortal won! He won with just a single rose flower."</p><p></p><p>"Damn! Is he really that amazing? Is it true?"</p><p></p><p>"Are you blind? Didn't you see that Liu Chengxun is kneeling on the surface of the river, vomiting blood?"</p><p></p><p>"Damn! Damn! Damn! Damn!"</p><p></p><p>"In one word - amazing!"</p><p></p><p>"From today on, I have a new idol - the Sword Immortal! The Sword Immortal is my father, my grandfather. Whoever dares to insult my idol, I'll unzip my pants and fight them to the death!"</p><p></p><p>Everyone was excited and their blood was boiling from this brilliant and spectacular sword strike.</p><p></p><p>There was only one person who was not happy.</p><p></p><p>This person was not Liu Chengxun, because he had already lost, lost completely.</p><p></p><p>If he had only lost a little bit, he might have felt some unwillingness.</p><p></p><p>But since he lost so thoroughly, there was no need for him to be unwilling.</p><p></p><p>The one who was not happy was Village Head Bichuan.</p><p></p><p>Originally, he was indeed a bit angry, after all, his direct disciple had been killed by the people of Jiuzhou. Even for the sake of his own face, he should come and settle the account with Ye Xiao.</p><p></p><p>But it had not reached the point where he absolutely had to come and fight Ye Xiao.</p><p></p><p>Because he had already watched the video of the previous battle on the video website.</p><p></p><p>He knew that the death of his disciple was also largely his own fault.</p><p></p><p>The reason he came later was purely because he knew that Liu Chengxun was also going to come, so he wanted to take the opportunity to gain some advantage.</p><p></p><p>According to his plan, since Liu Chengxun was going to come, let him fight the opponent first. If he won, then Bichuan wouldn't have to take action himself, and he could even show off and say that he was being magnanimous, sparing Jiuzhou this time, which would give him great face in the world.</p><p></p><p>If Liu Chengxun failed, then at least Bichuan could wear down Ye Xiao's strength a bit.</p><p></p><p>In that case, when he took action himself, he could ensure a stable victory.</p><p></p><p>And he could still show off.</p><p></p><p>But unexpectedly, Liu Chengxun was directly defeated by Ye Xiao with a single sword strike. How could he still play this game? Liu Chengxun was ranked 49th, one rank higher than Bichuan himself.</p><p></p><p>That meant Liu Chengxun's strength was slightly higher than his own.</p><p></p><p>And now, this Liu Chengxun who was slightly stronger than him had been defeated, so according to the calculation formula:</p><p></p><p>Sword Immortal > Liu Chengxun > Bichuan = Sword Immortal > Bichuan.</p><p></p><p>He was doomed! He couldn't fight, absolutely couldn't fight.</p><p></p><p>Unless he had water in his brain.</p><p></p><p>While everyone was still immersed in the Sword Immortal's victory, he quietly began to retreat.</p><p></p><p>His figure, in an area unseen by the crowd, slowly started to back away.</p><p></p><p>But he wanted to run, and Stone Guanghao and Lang Xingyue were still here.</p><p></p><p>These two Divine Ancestors were specially sent by the Jiuzhou side to monitor him and Liu Chengxun.</p><p></p><p>Moreover, they were all Divine Ancestors, and while Bichuan could hide from others' eyes, he couldn't hide from their gaze.</p><p></p><p>"It seems Village Head Bichuan is also moving, ready to take action?"</p><p></p><p>Bichuan: "Σ(°△°|||)︴!"</p><p></p><p>Damn it, he was discovered.</p><p></p><p>"Ahem."</p><p></p><p>He coughed lightly and said, "Brother Stone, actually, I've had some new insights into the Dao of the Sword these past few days, and my realm is unstable. Now that I think about it, I should go back first to consolidate my realm, and then come back to spar with your Jiuzhou Sword Immortal friend. </p><p></p><p>This way, we can both fully enjoy it."</p><p></p><p>Stone Guanghao and Lang Xingyue exchanged a glance, both seeing the cold laughter in each other's eyes.</p><p></p><p>Joke, who do you think you are? The mighty Jiuzhou, is it somewhere you can come and go as you please?</p><p></p><p>If it was the Sword Immortal who was injured instead of Liu Chengxun, you would probably be shouting to start the battle right now, wouldn't you? Do you really think Jiuzhou is easy to bully? Are we all fools?</p><p></p><p>Now that the Sword Immortal is so strong, it's the perfect time to crush your arrogance. How can we not seize the opportunity?</p><p></p><p>"Village Head Bichuan, you're being too distant. We are all members of the Human Clan, friends. It's just a friendly sparring, why are you taking it so seriously? Do you want to make it a life-or-death struggle? Wouldn't that be a loss for our Human Clan?"</p><p></p><p>Lang Xingyue also egged him on:</p><p></p><p>"Brother Stone is right, it's just a friendly sparring after all. Village Head Bichuan, why be so concerned? Today, so many spectators from Jiuzhou have come, if you don't show off a bit, wouldn't that be disrespectful to our Jiuzhou?"</p><p></p><p>Bichuan cursed the ancestors of these two in his heart.</p><p></p><p>You two are also Divine Ancestors, why don't you go show off yourselves? Can you even handle it?</p><p></p><p>Liu Chengxun struck first and was still injured, indicating that the opponent's sword intent and cultivation were far superior to Liu Chengxun's.</p><p></p><p>If there were no accidents, the opponent's sword intent would not be weak either. Combined with his cultivation, dealing with him, Bichuan might end up even more injured than Liu Chengxun.</p><p></p><p>For existences at their level, being able to avoid injury, or at least minimize injury, was important.</p><p></p><p>Because injury meant stagnation or even regression in cultivation.</p><p></p><p>This could seriously hinder their future advancement to the pinnacle of Divine Ancestor.</p><p></p><p>The experts were...</p><p></p><p>Here is the full English translation of the Chinese excerpt:</p><p></p><p>I'm very wary of this matter.</p><p></p><p>It's just like the common saying - the richer a person is, the more afraid of death they become.</p><p></p><p>Because they all know how hard it is to build up their wealth.</p><p></p><p>Once they die, they'll lose everything.</p><p></p><p>But now these two Godly Patriarchs are blocking the way, obviously not letting me leave.</p><p></p><p>Although the Sword Immortal is very powerful, dealing with two Godly Patriarchs is much better than dealing with just one.</p><p></p><p>There's no choice, I can only grit my teeth and go for it.</p><p></p><p>"Hehe, Brother Shi and Brother Lang are right, it's just a friendly exchange, not a life-and-death battle. Just do your best, just do your best."</p><p></p><p>With that, he obediently retreated back.</p><p></p><p>But looking at the rose below, his gaze flashed with deep vigilance.</p><p></p><p>He knew that the power hidden within that rose was far, far beyond his own.</p><p></p><p>Brute force definitely won't work, he needs to come up with a plan.</p><p></p><p>What kind of plan? </p><p></p><p>Aha, he'll use the Illusion Blade Technique from the Iga Ninja School.</p><p></p><p>The Illusion Blade Technique is a move created to confuse the opponent, mainly by launching a barrage of blade beams while hiding his true body in some corner to launch a sneak attack.</p><p></p><p>Its killing power on normal days is definitely not enough, as any true sword expert can easily see through its flaws and break through it.</p><p></p><p>But this time is different, the little girl in front of him is not the Sword Immortal himself, but just a projection of the Sword Immortal's sword intent.</p><p></p><p>With just a projection of sword intent, what is there to be afraid of?</p><p></p><p>As long as he can evade the sword intent, there won't be any problem.</p><p></p><p>By then, even if he has already made his move, Shi Guanghao and Lang Xinyue won't be able to stop him from leaving, and they won't have any reason to intercept him.</p><p></p><p>That's it! Perfect!</p><p></p><p>Taking a deep breath, he began to gather his aura.</p><p></p><p>The oppressive presence of the Godly Patriarchs descended once again, and although they had experienced it before, it was still so overwhelming.</p><p></p><p>The crowd felt discomfort again.</p><p></p><p>"Look, it's Murakumo Tsukumo making his move!"</p><p></p><p>"This time it's a duel of sword techniques, I wonder how powerful Murakumo Tsukumo's sword skills are, and how strong the Senior Sword Immortal's sword skills are."</p><p></p><p>"The Senior Sword Immortal's sword skills are definitely not weaker than his sword skills, since he's the Sword Immortal, sword first."</p><p></p><p>The crowd soon found it impossible to continue their discussion, as Murakumo Tsukumo's aura brought an ever-increasing pressure.</p><p></p><p>The powerful pressure once again forced many low-level cultivators to kneel down. They simply couldn't withstand the might of a Godly Patriarch.</p><p></p><p>However, this time many people were smarter. </p><p></p><p>While others kneeled, they lay down.</p><p></p><p>Ah, this way they could see the Senior Sword Immortal's attacks.</p><p></p><p>Many of them hadn't seen the previous strike, which was truly regrettable.</p><p></p><p>This time, they wouldn't miss it.</p><p></p><p>Some even went so far as to wear sunglasses to prevent the glare, so they could better observe the attacks of the Godly Patriarch.</p><p></p><p>Finally, under the gaze of all, Murakumo Tsukumo made his move.</p><p></p><p>The moment he acted, twenty-four massive blade beams formed simultaneously.</p><p></p><p>Each blade beam was over ten thousand meters long.</p><p></p><p>Each blade beam contained endless killing intent.</p><p></p><p>Each blade beam gave a sense of suffocating pressure.</p><p></p><p>At this moment, the low-level cultivators who finally witnessed a Godly Patriarch's attack were utterly shocked.</p><p></p><p>Is this what a Godly Patriarch is like?</p><p></p><p>No wonder they are called Godly Patriarchs, they are no longer human at all! They are like walking warships!</p><p></p><p>With just a casual move, they can achieve such a heavenly feat.</p><p></p><p>Shi Guanghao and Lang Xinyue couldn't help but furrow their brows slightly, though others couldn't tell. As Godly Patriarchs, they could see through Murakumo Tsukumo's intentions.</p><p></p><p>Unexpectedly, this guy is so sneaky. It seems the Sword Immortal's second move may not be able to hurt him now.</p><p></p><p>What a pity!</p><p></p><p>Such a good opportunity.</p><p></p><p>"Iga Ninja Art: Illusion Slash! Open!" </p><p></p><p>Murakumo Tsukumo's mouth curled up in a slight smile, and with a command, the twenty-four massive blade beams fell simultaneously.</p><p></p><p>He also hid himself in the shadow of one of the blade beams, avoiding the main thrust of Ye Xiao's attack. In this way, he would have nothing to worry about.</p><p></p><p>On the ground, the second rose that sensed Murakumo Tsukumo's attack quickly released a dense golden glow.</p><p></p><p>The mighty sword intent, mixed with the thick energy compressed by Ye Xiao, quickly formed a tyrannical sword beam.</p><p></p><p>No, not just one sword beam, but two, three, four... The sword beams were rapidly spreading, and visibly transforming into ten, fifty, a hundred!</p><p></p><p>Then, with thunderous, overwhelming force, they shot towards the sky.</p><p></p><p>"So strong!" </p><p></p><p>Shi Guanghao and Lang Xinyue's pupils constricted, and even the recovering Liu Chengxun had his hair standing on end.</p><p></p><p>As for Murakumo Tsukumo, who was hiding in the corner of the blade beams, he was instantly scared out of his wits.</p>

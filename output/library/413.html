        <h1>Chapter 413</h1>
        <div class="content">
            <p>Here is the full English translation of the Chinese excerpt:</p><p></p><p>The Alpha King, who had been in a deep slumber for tens of thousands of years, chose to cling to life because his sole motivation was to survive.</p><p></p><p>To live on was his only driving force.</p><p></p><p>Even an existence as powerful as a Godly Emperor, who could comprehend the heavens and the earth, would ultimately be reduced to dust in the vast expanse of time, completely disappearing into the river of time.</p><p></p><p>Therefore, even though he had once been a Godly King realm expert, at this moment, he could still choose to lower his stance and acknowledge Ye Xiao as his master.</p><p></p><p>He just wanted to live.</p><p></p><p>He was willing to completely discard any sense of Godly King dignity.</p><p></p><p>Furthermore, even when he was a Godly King level expert, hadn't he often knelt before those Godly Emperor level existences in the past? Kneeling was certainly better than dying.</p><p></p><p>Unfortunately, Ye Xiao merely indifferently said:</p><p></p><p>"To choose to kneel so easily, no wonder you betrayed your country and were suppressed and sealed by the Godly Emperors back then."</p><p></p><p>The Alpha King's heart sank, filled with extreme terror.</p><p></p><p>The fact that the other party had spoken these words meant he almost knew how the other party would treat him.</p><p></p><p>True enough, just as he had that thought, Ye Xiao's Dao Spiritual Sense directly tore apart his divine soul.</p><p></p><p>"Noâ€”!"</p><p></p><p>The Alpha King let out an unwilling roar, and in the next moment, his divine soul was completely shredded to pieces by Ye Xiao, beyond any chance of revival.</p><p></p><p>In fact, he would have been a very good subordinate, but unfortunately, he was inherently rebellious.</p><p></p><p>Even in the ancient times, it was because he betrayed the Ancient Divine Kingdom that he was sealed.</p><p></p><p>Now that he had finally revived after countless years, his backbone was still so weak. If Ye Xiao recruited him, who knows when he might rebel again.</p><p></p><p>Ye Xiao didn't want to leave himself with such a big headache.</p><p></p><p>And there was another very important reason.</p><p></p><p>Just as he wanted Ye Xiao's divine blood, Ye Xiao also wanted his divine blood!</p><p></p><p>Compared to an unreliable subordinate, what could be better than enhancing his own strength?</p><p></p><p>At this time, someone in the distance had sensed the abnormality and was rushing over here.</p><p></p><p>Ye Xiao's gaze flickered, and he directly stored the Alpha King's corpse in his spatial ring, then took away another giant coffin from the group of coffins.</p><p></p><p>According to the Alpha King's memories, inside was another Godly King realm expert - the Flame Dragon King! His body also still contained a large amount of divine blood.</p><p></p><p>Ye Xiao glanced at the fallen Ning family experts on the ground, snapped his fingers, and cast several immortality techniques, infusing them into the bodies of the deceased, reviving them.</p><p></p><p>This could be considered as compensation for taking the two Godly King corpses from the Ning family.</p><p></p><p>All of this was completed in an instant. After that, he then turned and disappeared from the scene, leaving.</p><p></p><p>When he left, the Ning family's experts quickly arrived.</p><p></p><p>Coincidentally, the people they had previously seen killed by the Alpha King had revived.</p><p></p><p>"What's going on?"</p><p></p><p>The few of them touched their heads, somewhat puzzled.</p><p></p><p>"We remember that a powerful expert we had never seen before suddenly appeared here. We hadn't even had a chance to act, and he had already slaughtered us.</p><p></p><p>How come we've revived now?"</p><p></p><p>"We don't know either. We just arrived and saw you all getting up from the ground. We're just as confused."</p><p></p><p>At this time, someone discovered the anomaly.</p><p></p><p>"Quick, look, one of the coffins here is broken. And the one next to it has also disappeared!"</p><p></p><p>"What did you say?"</p><p></p><p>"Damn it! Those were the coffins sealing the Godly Kings. Quickly notify the young master!"</p><p></p><p>Ten minutes later, the entire Jianghai City had descended into chaos.</p><p></p><p>Alarm sirens were sounding, defense troops were patrolling the streets, and the citizens of Jianghai City were forced to return home.</p><p></p><p>As for Ye Xiao, he had already returned to his own home.</p><p></p><p>From the Alpha King's soul memories, he had already searched for the information he wanted - all about the era before the collapse of the Ancient Divine Kingdom.</p><p></p><p>After the fall of the Ancient Divine Kingdom, he had already been sealed for an unknown length of time.</p><p></p><p>In the Alpha King's memories, that Ancient Divine Kingdom had once been extremely glorious.</p><p></p><p>It had possessed a total of thirteen Godly Emperors, and its territory had once spread across hundreds of star domains.</p><p></p><p>The Godly King realm experts within it were countless in number.</p><p></p><p>This made Ye Xiao couldn't help but sigh.</p><p></p><p>Such a powerful Ancient Divine Kingdom had ultimately been erased by the passage of time - it just showed how cruel time could be!</p><p></p><p>Apart from this, Ye Xiao also sensed something unusual.</p><p></p><p>According to the Alpha King's memories, in the ancient times, the mighty Ancient Divine Kingdom was far from being the only one! It meant that the number of star realms back then was far greater than the present.</p><p></p><p>However, Ye Xiao couldn't understand why. From the books he had brought from the Ning family, he could feel that the current star domain had become much smaller.</p><p></p><p>This made Ye Xiao feel very puzzled. Had the star realms been shrinking? Or had some catastrophe occurred, causing the star realms to be divided into many different universes, like the continental drift of the past?</p><p></p><p>It seemed that there were still many mysteries about this star realm that he did not know.</p><p></p><p>Unfortunately, the Alpha King's memories only went this far, and the rest was completely gone.</p><p></p><p>Here is my translation of the Chinese excerpt:</p><p></p><p>Leaf Xiao sighed softly, as if self-mocking with a smile. </p><p></p><p>"I feel like I'm aiming too high right now. I'm just trash that hasn't even reached the Deity King realm, so why am I thinking about all this? I should just focus on cultivating and improving myself."</p><p></p><p>After saying this, he activated his Ride the Void Art and instantly teleported into the underground cellar.</p><p></p><p>When the Beast Lords saw Leaf Xiao suddenly appear, they were all greatly startled and quickly backed away, afraid of bumping into him and drawing his attention.</p><p></p><p>At this time, Leaf Xiao took out the corpse of the Alpha King from his spatial storage ring. Although the Alpha King had died, he had once been a powerful Deity King expert. His corpse still emanated an awe-inspiring aura that suppressed the Beast Lords, making it hard for them to breathe.</p><p></p><p>The Beast Lords couldn't help but tremble in fear. </p><p></p><p>"Heavens, this pressure is so strong! Is he a Deity Slayer expert?"</p><p></p><p>"No, even a Deity Slayer wouldn't have this much majesty! He's a Deity King! A Deity King!"</p><p></p><p>Leaf Xiao paid them no mind and directly began extracting the divine blood from the Alpha King's body to absorb and refine it.</p><p></p><p>The Beast Lords were completely dumbfounded. How could this person have already killed a Deity King? Had he really reached the Deity King realm in such a short time? His cultivation speed was simply monstrous.</p><p></p><p>Soon, Leaf Xiao took out another black jade coffin from his storage ring and opened it, causing the Beast Lords to be alarmed once more. </p><p></p><p>A hoarse voice emerged from the coffin, "The seal has been broken! Was it Alpha who broke the seal? Hehe, we finally get to see the light of day again!"</p><p></p><p>But before the figure in the coffin could finish speaking, Leaf Xiao ruthlessly crushed his throat with one hand and then used his Rend the Stars Fist to blast a hole through his chest, instantly destroying his soul.</p><p></p><p>The Beast Lords were left utterly stunned, unable to comprehend what had just happened.</p>

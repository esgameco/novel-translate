        <h1>Chapter 382</h1>
        <div class="content">
            <p>Here is the full English translation of the Chinese excerpt:</p><p></p><p>"Just kidding."</p><p></p><p>At this moment, Song Qingxue suddenly spoke:</p><p></p><p>"Oh, look, the Talent Pillar below has been lit up."</p><p></p><p>"Let me see, it really has! Not bad, Brother Ning, it seems your Ning family will reap some harvests this time."</p><p></p><p>Ning Zhiyuan nodded, not very concerned. For the mighty Ning family, one or two future Godly Realm experts would hardly be considered a rare treasure.</p><p></p><p>Not to mention the Ning family's orthodox main branch, even some branch families could cultivate Godly Realm powerhouses.</p><p></p><p>The Ning family experts who came here were just a drop in the bucket, and they were the weakest of the bunch.</p><p></p><p>However, at this moment, Song Qingxue exclaimed again.</p><p></p><p>"Quick, look! The Talent Pillar below has lit up another layer, no, not just one layer, but ten layers. No, it's still rising, it's getting higher and higher, it's already exceeded a hundred layers!</p><p>It's still rising!"</p><p></p><p>Everyone was stunned and immediately looked down below.</p><p></p><p>Exceeding a hundred layers meant that the human race of the Nine Realms would cultivate an existence at the Slay God Realm level.</p><p></p><p>"Brother Ning, it seems your family's luck is quite good."</p><p></p><p>Ning Zhiyuan nodded.</p><p></p><p>This time, he did not remain silent. Even for the mighty Ning family, a Slay God Realm expert could be considered a rare talent.</p><p></p><p>However, the Talent Pillar did not stop there. It continued to climb to even higher layers.</p><p></p><p>One hundred and ten layers, one hundred and twenty layers, one hundred and thirty layers, in the blink of an eye, it had broken through two hundred layers.</p><p></p><p>"It's broken through two hundred layers!"</p><p></p><p>The crowd couldn't help but exclaim in surprise. This time, they could no longer remain unmoved.</p><p></p><p>Because the one who could break through this level was far superior to their own aptitude.</p><p></p><p>"Brother Ning, your Ning family is really going to make a big fortune this time."</p><p></p><p>Ling Shaoyu couldn't help but exclaim in surprise.</p><p></p><p>And Song Qingxue's face turned solemn as she said, "No, it's still rising, it hasn't ended yet."</p><p></p><p>Two hundred and ten layers, two hundred and twenty layers, two hundred and thirty layers, two hundred and forty layers, two hundred and fifty layers, the hearts of the crowd began to beat faster.</p><p></p><p>This level had already surpassed them, and surpassed all of them.</p><p></p><p>In other words, there would be a genius below who was more powerful than the young masters of the Xuanyuan Clan's main branch families, the most outstanding talents among the major orthodox families.</p><p></p><p>Two hundred and sixty, two hundred and seventy, two hundred and eighty, two hundred and ninety, three hundred! "It, it's broken through three hundred."</p><p></p><p>Song Qingxue swallowed hard, her voice starting to tremble.</p><p></p><p>But the Talent Pillar did not stop there. Its brilliance continued to rise further.</p><p></p><p>Three hundred and one, three hundred and two, in the blink of an eye, it had broken through four hundred.</p><p></p><p>"It's already broken through four hundred!"</p><p></p><p>Song Qingxue spoke softly, her face already starting to numb.</p><p></p><p>Then the crowd watched as the Talent Pillar lit up layer by layer.</p><p></p><p>Five hundred!</p><p>Six hundred!</p><p>Seven hundred!</p><p>Eight hundred!</p><p>Nine hundred!</p><p></p><p>Boom! When its power reached its limit, it continued to emit even stronger light! Finally, it seemed to be unable to withstand the other's talent and completely exploded.</p><p></p><p>A thunderous roar rose from the ground, a mushroom cloud shooting into the sky, and a massive shockwave spread out in all directions, causing countless trees to fall.</p><p></p><p>"What's happening?"</p><p>"What's going on? Why did we suddenly hear an explosion?"</p><p>"Could it be that another Clan has invaded the mortal world?"</p><p></p><p>The warriors on the ground, as well as the powerful experts from the major Xuanyuan Clans stationed here, couldn't help but fly out of their rooms and look towards that direction.</p><p></p><p>In the sky above, the young masters of the major Xuanyuan Clan branches were completely in disarray.</p><p></p><p>Nine hundred layers fully lit up, a level like this, even the Xuanyuan Clan's holy sons might not necessarily be able to reach.</p><p></p><p>It should only be the top-tier existences in the starry sky who could achieve this.</p><p></p><p>To put it rather arrogantly, if this person's existence is real, he may very well bring the entire Xuanyuan Clan to an unprecedented new height.</p><p></p><p>He may even change the current order of the starry sky.</p><p></p><p>This made them find it hard to believe their own eyes, feeling as if they were dreaming or under an illusion.</p><p></p><p>Otherwise, how could such a strange thing happen? This is just a small human world where the descendants of the Xuanyuan Clan reside, a tiny world.</p><p></p><p>How could there be such a top-tier genius in this tiny place? What a joke! How could such an existence appear here?</p><p></p><p>"Well, maybe it's because the Talent Pillar has been activated for too long, so it's malfunctioned and caused this erroneous judgment."</p><p></p><p>Ling Shaoyu couldn't help but speak up, and the others quickly nodded and echoed in agreement.</p><p></p><p>"Yes, yes, you're absolutely right."</p><p>"I also think that's the case. Ling Junior, don't you still have many Talent Pillars? Why don't you take out a few more and try them?"</p><p>"Okay!"</p><p></p><p>Ling Shaoyu was quick to act, and he soon took out another Talent Pillar and tossed it to the ground.</p><p></p><p>A few minutes later...</p><p></p><p>Here is my translation of the Chinese excerpt:</p><p></p><p>Boom! Another violent explosion.</p><p></p><p>The group fell silent once again.</p><p></p><p>Ling Shaoyu slowly spoke:</p><p></p><p>"Should I throw another one down now?"</p><p></p><p>"I think you can."</p><p></p><p>A few minutes later.</p><p></p><p>Boom! This time, the group really didn't know what to say anymore.</p><p></p><p>Now there was no need for the slightest doubt, it could be 100% confirmed - there was truly a super genius down there.</p><p></p><p>After a moment, Song Qingxue was the first to speak:</p><p></p><p>"Everyone, I suddenly remembered I have something to do, I'll head back first, see you all tomorrow!"</p><p></p><p>"Everyone, I'll head back as well. You all can continue chatting."</p><p></p><p>Ling Shaoyu also turned and left.</p><p></p><p>The others then left one by one.</p><p></p><p>After everyone had completely departed, Ning Zhiyuan took a deep breath and immediately descended to the mortal world, into the Ye family's manor.</p><p></p><p>"Second Uncle."</p><p></p><p>Ning Second Uncle had previously fought the great fish and sustained quite a few injuries, so he had been recuperating and had not gone into battle recently. </p><p></p><p>Seeing Ning Zhiyuan return, he slowly walked out and said:</p><p></p><p>"What just happened? Why did three violent explosions suddenly sound out? Didn't you all fail at robbing the Divine King's Tomb? The hundred tribes surely wouldn't have come to attack us, would they?"</p><p></p><p>Ning Zhiyuan's expression was grave as he said:</p><p></p><p>"Second Uncle, this time it's really a big deal. And an especially big one at that."</p><p></p><p>"What happened?"</p><p></p><p>Ning Second Uncle's expression suddenly changed.</p><p></p><p>Ning Zhiyuan told him about what had just occurred, and upon hearing it, Ning Second Uncle's eyes bulged out to an extreme degree, looking like a cow's eyes.</p><p></p><p>"Are you joking with me? How could an existence of that level appear in a place like this?</p><p></p><p>To put it bluntly, even if it appeared in the Xuanyuan Clan's territory, that would already be considered the Xuanyuan Clan's ancestral grave smoking!</p><p></p><p>This is just a small human world. Although it is the offspring of our Xuanyuan Clan, the blood energy here is weak, so such an existence should absolutely not have been born here."</p><p></p><p>Ning Zhiyuan shrugged helplessly. "I also wish this was fake, but unfortunately it's real."</p><p></p><p>Ning Second Uncle let out a deep, turbid breath.</p><p></p><p>"You shouldn't have come back! You should have directly sent a message to the Ning Clan. If I'm guessing correctly, the reason they left so quickly was likely to report to their own clan. </p><p></p><p>They're probably afraid that in not too long, their clan will dispatch a super expert to come here and search for that peerless genius."</p><p></p><p>Ning Zhiyuan shook his head.</p><p></p><p>"I'm not too worried about that. When they left just now, I had already sent a message notifying my clan to dispatch powerful experts to come.</p><p></p><p>What I'm thinking about now is, could that person be the one I saw before? The one this world calls the Sword-Immortal?"</p><p></p><p>Ning Second Uncle nodded.</p><p></p><p>"That's very likely. It's just a pity that we were previously only focused on excavating the Divine Tomb, and didn't put our focus on this. Otherwise, we might have already found that super genius."</p><p></p><p>Ning Zhiyuan's expression grew even more grave as he said:</p><p></p><p>"What I'm thinking about now isn't even that problem, but rather that palm print. Second Uncle, have you ever thought about it? The Sword-Immortal has never left Jianghai City? He's been here the whole time.</p><p></p><p>Last time, it was because he acted that the Black Soul Clan's Xiong Benkong was destroyed.</p><p></p><p>These past few days while I was contending with the hundred tribes, I paid special attention, and not a single person from the Black Soul Clan appeared."</p><p></p><p>Ning Second Uncle's heart shook.</p><p></p><p>"If what you're saying is true, doesn't that mean his cultivation has already broken through to the Godly Realm's ninth layer?</p><p></p><p>But how long has it been since he ascended to Godhood? At most a few months, right?</p><p></p><p>Even if his talent is monstrous, it's impossible for him to have reached this level in just a few months."</p><p></p><p>"What if he obtained a Divine King's inheritance?"</p><p></p><p>"No, that can't be so coincidental, right?"</p><p></p><p>Ning Second Uncle paused, and Ning Zhiyuan spoke again:</p><p></p><p>"This time when we entered that Divine King's Tomb, we found that the Divine King's Tomb was already completely empty.</p><p></p><p>At first I couldn't understand this problem - all the formations inside were intact, and the spiritual energy was also at the level a Divine King's Tomb should have.</p><p></p><p>So why was there nothing there?</p><p></p><p>There can only be one explanation - he is also a formation master.</p><p></p><p>Don't forget, he is an exceptional genius. He cultivated both the Dao of the Sword and the Dao of the Blade, and his achievements in both were excellent. Adding in formations as well shouldn't be a big deal for him.</p><p></p><p>I previously studied the books related to the Sword-Immortal, and they mentioned that he also had a very high level in the Dao of Formations.</p><p></p><p>So, could it be that he entered the Divine King's Tomb in advance, took everything, and then perfectly restored the formations?</p><p></p><p>If that's the case, it would explain the situation we encountered today."</p>

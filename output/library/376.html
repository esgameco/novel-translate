        <h1>Chapter 376</h1>
        <div class="content">
            <p>Here is the full English translation of the Chinese excerpt:</p><p></p><p>With the endless refinement of the divine blood within the Divine Monarch's Realm in his body, coupled with the constant consumption of the elixirs obtained from that Divine Monarch's Tomb, his cultivation base has been continuously and rapidly surging.</p><p></p><p>Finally, after a month, Ye Xiao's cultivation base advanced from the Fifth Realm of the Divine Monarch's Realm to the Ninth Realm.</p><p></p><p>Even he himself did not expect to break through so quickly. </p><p></p><p>He had originally calculated that by refining all the remaining divine blood of the Divine Monarchs, his cultivation would at most reach the Eighth Realm of the Divine Monarch's Realm, but unexpectedly, he advanced one more realm.</p><p></p><p>Upon further reflection, he finally understood the reason.</p><p></p><p>It was because he had also synthesized another ancient precious technique.</p><p></p><p>After the synthesis of this precious technique, Ye Xiao's advancement speed increased even faster, allowing him to directly break through to such a high realm in such a short time.</p><p></p><p>This also made Ye Xiao unable to help but marvel at the terrifying power of the Divine Monarch's Realm once again! Even though they had been dead for who knows how many tens of thousands of years, the divine blood in their bodies had not dissipated to any significant degree, and it still possessed such powerful strength that it allowed him to directly break through several small realms.</p><p></p><p>If it were a Divine Monarch at the peak of their power, and Ye Xiao were to refine them, his own body might directly explode into a mist of blood due to being unable to withstand the immense energy.</p><p></p><p>However, being able to obtain so much cultivation in the present is already quite good.</p><p></p><p>One must learn to be content, for contentment brings happiness.</p><p></p><p>During this one-month period, Ye Xiao also refined another divine technique - the Great Heavenly Contending Spirit! Originally, he had wanted to find a movement technique, but the books were too scattered, so he ended up looking at some other things as well.</p><p></p><p>Unexpectedly, he did not find the movement technique, but instead discovered this item.</p><p></p><p>This is a forging divine technique! Just like the Dao of Creation, it is used to forge divine weapons.</p><p></p><p>And at this time, Ye Xiao's alchemy and healing techniques also finally lit up.</p><p></p><p>Previously, when Ye Xiao had found two alchemy techniques, he had originally thought that the alchemy techniques would resonate with a certain divine technique and start glowing, but unexpectedly, they remained dormant.</p><p></p><p>Now they have finally started to show activity, but it is not a synthesis, but rather a pre-synthesis lighting up prompt.</p><p></p><p>Along with the two alchemy techniques and two forging techniques, it is the cultivation method that has lit up. This is something that Ye Xiao did not expect.</p><p></p><p>Because the first two were still easy to explain, as they had some commonalities - one was alchemy, and the other was forging, both belonging to the category of refining things, and both being auxiliary in cultivation.</p><p></p><p>As for the subsequent cultivation method, it left Ye Xiao somewhat puzzled.</p><p></p><p>Could it be... that the cultivation method is... a reserve of energy?</p><p></p><p>Just like when Sister Wang was promoted and given a raise, there had to be so many golden hoops supporting her from below, so alchemy and forging similarly require sufficient spiritual energy to support them?</p><p></p><p>Oh well, let it be however it is, as long as the synthesis is successful and it can be used effectively, that's all that matters.</p><p></p><p>During this period, it is said that there have been constant conflicts between the XuanYuan Clan and the Hundred Clans outside.</p><p></p><p>Originally, a single XuanYuan Ning was able to easily defeat three major clans, so the problem was not too serious. But now that the Xuanyuan Clan has sent several direct descendants, and the other side has brought nearly a hundred clans, the two sides have become somewhat evenly matched.</p><p></p><p>The main manifestation of the strength of the higher-ranked clans is in their top combat power.</p><p></p><p>That is, the Divine Monarchs, or even the legendary Divine Emperors! Sometimes, the appearance of a single Divine Emperor is enough to annihilate the Hundred Clans!</p><p></p><p>Otherwise, how could they be called the Emperors among the Gods?</p><p></p><p>But the Divine Emperors certainly cannot casually come out, as beings of that level, a single movement can shake an entire star domain.</p><p></p><p>Such powerful existences, they must surely be restraining each other.</p><p></p><p>The other high-ranking clans also cannot just watch as the Xuanyuan Clan so recklessly dispatch top-tier experts to deal with the lower-ranked clans.</p><p></p><p>If that were the case, how would it be any different from tolerating a bandit? So this has led to the current endless cycle of warfare, where there is no large-scale eruption, but also no resolution.</p><p></p><p>Everyone is in a stalemate, and at the same time, hastily digging up tombs. It is said that every day, the number of tombs being excavated in the starry sky is already being counted in the tens of thousands! Thinking about these ancient divine nations' descendants, they really are quite tragic.</p><p></p><p>After being dead for so many years, in the end, the entire family, young and old, are all being dug up.</p><p></p><p>But to be honest, even if they dug for a hundred days, they still wouldn't be able to compare to the Divine Monarch's Tomb that Ye Xiao had excavated! A Divine Monarch is still a Divine Monarch, a hundred million Divine Monarch's Realm cultivators' reserves cannot compare to a single Divine Monarch, because what a Divine Monarch stores is not just a matter of quantity, but also quality!</p><p></p><p>To put it bluntly, the elixirs in a Divine Monarch's Tomb are probably many times better than the same-level elixirs outside. Ye Xiao couldn't be bothered to care more about them, let them dig their own tombs, while he enjoys the resources he plundered from the Divine Monarch's Tomb, and incidentally, excavates the divine nation's treasure trove.</p><p></p><p>His days are going quite smoothly.</p><p></p><p>That night, in Jianghai City, at the Ning Clan's residence, a black shadow silently entered. Ten minutes later, a huge explosion suddenly rang out in the manor.</p><p></p><p>"Boom!"</p><p>Flames shot up to the sky, and a massive mushroom cloud, like a towering pillar, kept rising towards the heavens.</p><p></p><p>"What's going on?"</p><p>"We're under attack!"</p><p></p><p>The members of the Xuanyuan Ning Clan hurriedly gathered from other places.</p><p></p><p>The next moment, the cold voice of Second Uncle Ning suddenly rang out in everyone's ears.</p><p></p><p>"Xiong Bengang, as a member of the..."</p><p></p><p>Here is the full English translation of the Chinese excerpt:</p><p></p><p>The expert of the Black Soul Clan, in the middle of the night, sneaked into my Ning family, it seems there must be something important, right?" </p><p></p><p>"Haha, I just accidentally wandered in, Brother Ning, why be so bothered? Now that I know this is the Ning family, I have offended you, so I'll take my leave."</p><p></p><p>"Do you think this is a place you can come and go as you please?"</p><p></p><p>The words had just fallen, a fist beam lit up the entire manor! Uncle Ning Two used the family's Five-Star Divine Technique, the Raging Fire Divine Fist, and struck towards Xiong Bengong's chest.</p><p></p><p>Boom! Another violent explosion, and the next second, Xiong Bengong's chest was directly pierced through by Uncle Ning Two's fist.</p><p></p><p>His burly figure was directly nailed to the ground by Uncle Ning Two, and his eyes lost their vitality in an instant.</p><p></p><p>Ning Zhiyuan and the other direct descendants quickly rushed over, seeing this scene, they couldn't help but heave a sigh of relief.</p><p></p><p>"Uncle Two, it's a good thing you were here. Otherwise, this guy would have escaped today."</p><p></p><p>"He has already escaped."</p><p></p><p>Uncle Ning Two's face was ice-cold as he spoke.</p><p></p><p>The expressions of Ning Zhiyuan and the others changed.</p><p></p><p>"How is that possible? Wasn't he just killed by you?"</p><p></p><p>Uncle Ning Two shook his head.</p><p></p><p>"He is from the Black Soul Clan, the Black Soul Clan's specialty is the technique of substitution. This body was actually just a puppet invaded by his soul. Although I killed this puppet, his soul has already instantly teleported outside, and he should have already found a new body, preparing to flee from Jianghai City."</p><p></p><p>Ning Zhiyuan's face turned cold:</p><p></p><p>"Then what about the diagram of the Divine King's Tomb?"</p><p></p><p>"He has already seen it."</p><p></p><p>"Damn it! We had just obtained this diagram of the Divine King's Tomb, and haven't even had a chance to excavate it, and it's been seen by him. What are we going to do?"</p><p></p><p>Uncle Ning Two's eyes flashed with a cold light.</p><p></p><p>"Now we must do two things: first, immediately deploy the Great Wall Formation, that formation I have tried, even I cannot break through. So it should be able to block the other party's escape.</p><p></p><p>Secondly, immediately unite with other families, quickly analyze the diagram, and find that Divine King's Tomb."</p><p></p><p>"Yes!"</p><p></p><p>Ning Zhiyuan immediately gave the order. In the crowd, Jing Di gave Beitang Ce a look, and Beitang Ce immediately ran back to his room and contacted Ye Xiao.</p><p></p><p>Ye Xiao had just returned home and hadn't started cooking yet when the spiritual sense stone rang. It showed that Beitang Ce was contacting him.</p><p></p><p>"Hello? What's the matter?"</p><p></p><p>"Ye Xiao, there's big trouble."</p><p></p><p>The anxious voice came from the other end of the spiritual sense stone.</p><p></p><p>"What happened?"</p><p></p><p>"Recently, the Ning family discovered a diagram of a Divine King's Tomb in the tomb of a Deicide Realm expert. But just now, it was seen by a spy from the Black Soul Clan, and the other party has already fled from the Ning family.</p><p></p><p>If the other party spreads this news, it will cause a lot of trouble, as the other hundred clans will definitely try to get their hands on the Divine King's Tomb."</p><p></p><p>Ye Xiao's brow furrowed slightly.</p><p></p><p>This was indeed a troublesome matter.</p><p></p><p>He definitely didn't want anyone else to know about this, but the reality was that the Ning family already knew, so there was no way to prevent it.</p><p></p><p>However, the fewer people who knew about this, the better.</p><p></p><p>Because that way, the time to find the Divine King's Tomb would be shorter.</p><p></p><p>"I understand, leave it to me."</p><p></p><p>Ending the connection, Ye Xiao put away the spiritual sense stone, took a deep breath, and immediately released his spiritual power to search.</p><p></p><p>The next moment, he had pinpointed a location.</p><p></p><p>"Found you!"</p><p></p><p>With a turn of his feet, Ye Xiao left the original spot.</p><p></p><p>On the other side, on the main street of Jianghai City, a fashionably dressed young man was striding along with a smug expression, leisurely heading towards the city outskirts.</p><p></p><p>"Foolish Ning family, my substitution technique can only be broken by someone whose cultivation has reached the Deicide Realm, surpassing me by a realm.</p><p></p><p>The moment I fled from the Ning family, you had no chance of catching me.</p><p></p><p>I have already used the spiritual sense stone to transmit the diagram, I don't even need to bring it back myself. Next, I'm going to play around right under your noses for a few days, and enjoy watching your anxious expressions.</p><p></p><p>As for trying to catch me? Haha, dream on."</p><p></p><p>The words had just fallen, when a figure suddenly appeared in front of him.</p><p></p><p>This figure appeared so abruptly, so quickly.</p><p></p><p>He was slightly taken aback.</p><p></p><p>A pursuer? </p><p></p><p>This young pursuer? Shouldn't be possible, right?</p><p></p><p>The other party should have just randomly appeared here, because he was so young, he couldn't possibly have seen through his substitution technique.</p><p></p><p>Right now, he was just an ordinary person.</p><p></p><p>But the next moment, he realized he was wrong, and wrong in a big way.</p><p></p><p>Because after Ye Xiao appeared, he directly brought down a palm strike.</p><p></p><p>Boom! That palm strike was of terrifying power, directly splitting the ground into a palm print a kilometer wide, and instantly turning him into a bloody mess.</p>

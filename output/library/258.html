        <h1>Chapter 258</h1>
        <div class="content">
            <p>Here is the full English translation of the Chinese excerpt:</p><p></p><p>Sitting at home, Ye Xiao obtained two semi-divine beasts, which was an extremely lucrative gain for him.</p><p></p><p>The blood qi he obtained every day could now greatly enhance his cultivation.</p><p></p><p>The next step was to find a way to obtain some heavenly materials and earthly treasures to help the other star beasts and improve their cultivation.</p><p></p><p>Only then would he have enough blood qi for his own needs! Ye Xiao's mind stirred, and he immediately activated the Divine Intent Technique, disappearing from the spot and reappearing in the Southwest Forest Sea.</p><p></p><p>After reaching the King Realm, his speed had become unimaginably fast. It only took him a few breaths to travel from Jianghai City to the Southwest Forest Sea, so he could easily make the round trip in a single night.</p><p></p><p>Upon arriving at the Southwest Forest Sea, Ye Xiao went straight to the very center of the forest.</p><p></p><p>Last time, he had only searched the area around the center for the Myriad Colored Leaves, but this time, after reaching the true center, Ye Xiao's vast perception suddenly detected something extraordinary.</p><p></p><p>"What is this...?"</p><p></p><p>He sensed a peculiar existence deep underground, faintly visible, as if it was breathing.</p><p></p><p>Filled with curiosity, Ye Xiao descended to the ground and used the Earth Traversal Technique to quickly reach a depth of ten thousand meters underground.</p><p></p><p>"Roar!"</p><p></p><p>A melodious, ancient dragon's roar slowly echoed in his mind.</p><p></p><p>No one had expected that beneath the vast forest lay a colossal dragon.</p><p></p><p>No, it was not a dragon.</p><p></p><p>Although it had a physical form and was brimming with vitality and spirituality, it did not have the aura of blood qi.</p><p></p><p>In other words, it was a pure energy entity.</p><p></p><p>"It's a Dragon Vein!" </p><p></p><p>Ye Xiao instantly realized the origin of this being.</p><p></p><p>It was said that in the vast land of the Nine Provinces, due to the spiritually rich terrain, certain entities would gradually form over time.</p><p></p><p>They could both suppress the surrounding spiritual energy and continuously absorb it from the center, nourishing the land and making it even more spiritually abundant. Places with exceptional talents and resources were often blessed by such Dragon Veins.</p><p></p><p>The colossal entity before him was the legendary Dragon Vein, a miraculous creation of nature that had condensed the essence of heaven and earth within the mountains and rivers.</p><p></p><p>No wonder the Southwest Forest Sea could produce so many heavenly materials and earthly treasures. It was because a massive Dragon Vein was hidden beneath it.</p><p></p><p>Only a Dragon Vein could achieve such a feat, absorbing vast amounts of spiritual energy to nourish the land. </p><p></p><p>In a sense, the soil of the Southwest Forest Sea contained nutrients many times richer than other places.</p><p></p><p>Just like the Demonic Cliff, which had long been subjected to malevolent energy, the land there was imbued with dense demonic qi.</p><p></p><p>The Southwest Forest Sea, on the other hand, had been continuously nourished by spiritual energy, surpassing the description of merely "fertile soil".</p><p></p><p>At this moment, standing beside the Dragon Vein, Ye Xiao could even feel his own cultivation gradually rising.</p><p></p><p>However, since he had already reached the King Realm, the improvement was not very noticeable, progressing at a snail's pace. </p><p></p><p>But in reality, it was much faster than when he was in Jianghai City, where his cultivation could barely be considered crawling.</p><p></p><p>The spiritual energy here was simply too abundant.</p><p></p><p>"Roar!"</p><p></p><p>The giant dragon let out another roar, this time tinged with pain and helplessness.</p><p></p><p>Ye Xiao narrowed his eyes and activated the Grand Heavenly Technique to thoroughly scan the dragon.</p><p></p><p>In the next moment, he understood the situation, but he couldn't help feeling a sense of shock.</p><p></p><p>This colossal dragon was not a naturally formed Dragon Vein.</p><p></p><p>It was originally a spiritual entity that had been forcibly suppressed and bound to this place using powerful techniques, and then made to continuously absorb spiritual energy.</p><p></p><p>Over time, it had transformed into a Dragon Vein.</p><p></p><p>"What an incredible technique!"</p><p></p><p>Ye Xiao couldn't help but exclaim in admiration.</p><p></p><p>He didn't know which supreme expert had orchestrated this, but their methods were truly extraordinary.</p><p></p><p>To forcibly imprison a dragon's soul and refine it into a Dragon Vein, their abilities must have far surpassed the Imperial Techniques, reaching the realm of Great Spiritual Attainments.</p><p></p><p>At least for now, Ye Xiao knew he was still far from being able to accomplish such a feat.</p><p></p><p>It must have been the work of a legendary figure from the history of the Nine Provinces, whose cultivation had already reached the Emperor Realm or even higher.</p><p></p><p>Indeed, there are those who surpass others, and heavens beyond heavens.</p><p></p><p>It would be safer for him to stay cautious and secure.</p><p></p><p>At this moment, the dragon's soul let out another soft lament, still filled with sorrow, helplessness, and a touch of melancholy.</p><p></p><p>This was understandable.</p><p></p><p>It had been trapped here for an unknown number of years.</p><p></p><p>Now that the Dragon Vein had already formed, it no longer needed the dragon's soul, but the powerful expert who had bound it had never returned to set it free.</p><p></p><p>Although it only had its spiritual essence left, the Dragon Vein was formed from the essence of heaven, earth, sun, and moon, so it could not be easily destroyed or dispersed.</p><p></p><p>Here is the full English translation of the Chinese excerpt:</p><p></p><p>"So it will not die.</p><p></p><p>If nothing unexpected happens, it will continue to stay here forever, not knowing how many years and months it will be.</p><p></p><p>This is a thing a hundred times more painful than death, a lifetime, forever and ever, to be imprisoned here.</p><p></p><p>No wonder it emits such a desolate sound.</p><p></p><p>It seems to be begging for help from itself, and it also seems to be begging for liberation.</p><p></p><p>Ye Xiao exhaled a thick breath and said indifferently:</p><p></p><p>"You want to be liberated, but I have no way to help you. You have become one with the Dragon Vein, and it will take great divine abilities to separate you two.</p><p></p><p>With my current strength, I have not yet reached that level. If I forcibly separate you, your soul may immediately dissipate."</p><p></p><p>The Dragon Soul seemed to have understood Ye Xiao's words and let out a pleading cry again.</p><p></p><p>At this moment, Ye Xiao finally understood its meaning.</p><p></p><p>Even if it's death, it doesn't want to stay here any longer.</p><p></p><p>The time it has been imprisoned is simply too long and too long.</p><p></p><p>These countless long dark nights have tormented its spirit to the point of collapse, and then as time goes on, it has been repaired and then tormented to collapse again.</p><p></p><p>Loneliness has tortured its soul, but because of the Dragon Vein, it has never been able to be liberated.</p><p></p><p>Dragons are beings that soar through the nine heavens and roam the mountains and seas. How can they be trapped in this small world? Moreover, Ye Xiao is the first human being it has seen in such a long time.</p><p></p><p>And it is its last hope.</p><p></p><p>If Ye Xiao leaves, it really doesn't know who else can help it.</p><p></p><p>So it doesn't want to wait any longer. At this moment, even if it dies, even if its soul dissipates and it never reincarnates, it absolutely will not stay in this place.</p><p></p><p>Ye Xiao sighed slightly, although he felt a little regretful, but if it were him, he probably would have made the same choice? He remembered that in his previous life, he had once lain on a sickbed, unable to move, and even drinking a cup of water or going to the toilet had become a luxury.</p><p></p><p>That kind of pain and despair, helplessness and torment, where the soul is bound by the sick body, is something that ordinary people can never understand.</p><p></p><p>The next moment, the Taixuan Tiangong was activated, directly shattering the spiritual shackles that bound the Dragon Soul.</p><p></p><p>The Dragon Soul let out a huge roar, and the next second, it burst out of the ground and soared into the sky, freely frolicking and roaming in the sky.</p><p></p><p>But without the protection of the Dragon Vein, it gradually dissipated in an instant, like a firework, beautiful but fleeting, unable to last.</p><p></p><p>Ordinary people could not see this scene, they could only hear a deafening dragon roar and thought that there was a beast howling.</p><p></p><p>Ye Xiao was deeply moved, and just as he was about to leave, the next moment, a golden aura appeared in the Dragon Vein, very fine, only as long as a hair, curled up.</p><p></p><p>But the might it exuded made Ye Xiao's face somewhat solemn.</p><p></p><p>Subsequently, this aura directly entered Ye Xiao's body.</p><p></p><p>In an instant, Ye Xiao clearly saw his cultivation level had advanced a little.</p><p></p><p>This single boost to his cultivation level was about one-tenth.</p><p></p><p>What surprised him even more was that the three major sword techniques that were originally going to take a few more days to fully form had now directly reached 100% progress and were completed!</p><p></p><p>"So powerful. This should be the essence of the entire Dragon Vein."</p><p></p><p>That Dragon Soul, grateful to Ye Xiao for granting it liberation, so it gave Ye Xiao the most precious power in the entire Dragon Vein to boost his cultivation, and also accelerated the completion of the first martial art in the Golden Book.</p><p></p><p>Ye Xiao's mouth curled up slightly, it seems that this trip to the Southwest Forest Sea has truly been a big gain for him.</p><p></p><p>He infused his consciousness into the Golden Book.</p><p></p><p>Only to see that the three supreme imperial-level sword techniques had been combined into a new martial art.</p><p></p><p>On the pages recording the martial art, there were no complicated techniques, only two simple words: "Open Heaven"! Does this mean that a single sword strike can open the heavens?</p><p></p><p>Ye Xiao saw two small words in the lower right corner of the Golden Book.</p><p></p><p>"Slay God"? Could this be the level of this martial art?</p><p></p><p>Slay God Technique? Previously, when it was at the imperial level, the Golden Book did not display the level of the martial arts, but now it has revealed the level of the martial art.</p><p></p><p>This means that for the Golden Book, the imperial level is actually not top-tier?</p><p></p><p>Ye Xiao was slightly shocked.</p><p></p><p>He had a new understanding of the power of the Golden Book.</p><p></p><p>The imperial level is already extremely powerful, it can be considered the strongest martial art among the human race on the ground.</p><p></p><p>Even so, many people in their lifetime may not even be able to learn a good master-level martial art.</p><p></p><p>And the imperial level, almost only those above the Divine Sect have the opportunity to come into contact with.</p><p></p><p>But even the imperial level is not confirmed by the Golden Book.</p><p></p><p>Until now, after the imperial level martial arts were combined, the Slay God Technique level was revealed.</p><p></p><p>This means that for the Golden Book, the limit should be far beyond what is currently being displayed.</p><p></p><p>One more update, three thousand.</p><p></p><p>Please vote for monthly tickets, subscribe, and recommend.</p><p></p><p>Thank you to the readers 'Chuan Liu Bushi 2013', 'Feng De Yuan Dian', 'Ku Hai Qiu Zhi', 'Fei Zai Cheng', and 'Wu Ji' for their donations, I am deeply grateful.</p><p></p><p>I'm too tired, the update is late, I'll work hard to update.</p><p></p><p>(This chapter is complete)"</p>

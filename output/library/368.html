        <h1>Chapter 368</h1>
        <div class="content">
            <p>Here is the full English translation of the Chinese excerpt:</p><p></p><p>"This should be the place, I can feel the presence of our kind."</p><p></p><p>The leaders of the three great divine clans made contact, all three of them were powerful divine realm experts, terrifyingly strong! Although they did not release their auras, just by standing in the air, the oppressive pressure they exerted made countless people feel suffocated.</p><p></p><p>"According to the intelligence our Winged Divine Clan previously gathered, there are a large number of divine tombs in this star domain.</p><p></p><p>Although we don't know the reason, these divine tombs contain abundant cultivation resources."</p><p></p><p>"I heard the people of the Xuanyuan Divine Clan are also here, could it be that they made a move? To fight for the resources, so they secretly eliminated our clansmen?"</p><p></p><p>"Unlikely, the message sent back by the descendants of my Gigantic Ape Divine Clan says that there are many divine tombs, and neither the Xuanyuan Divine Clan nor them can exhaust them all!</p><p></p><p>The Xuanyuan Divine Clan people are busy excavating the divine tombs, they don't have time to make a move against them.</p><p></p><p>There must be some other reason, we should investigate this matter more thoroughly, after all, it involves the Xuanyuan Divine Clan, if we're not careful, it might even trigger a war, which would not be a good thing for us."</p><p></p><p>The crowd nodded in agreement.</p><p></p><p>The other party was right.</p><p></p><p>The strength of the Xuanyuan Divine Clan was undoubtedly formidable.</p><p></p><p>Ranked 19th among the divine clans in the starry sky, it's best to avoid provoking them if possible.</p><p></p><p>"We should first camp here and understand the situation in the vicinity."</p><p></p><p>"Brother Lekesi's strength is the greatest, since you've said so, then we can only follow your lead. Pass the order, we'll camp here. Then send out a group to investigate the surrounding situation."</p><p></p><p>The crowd immediately began to search for a star island to camp on.</p><p></p><p>In the starry sky, there were large and small star islands floating everywhere, countless in number.</p><p></p><p>At night, when viewed from the human world, these would form the dazzling stars.</p><p></p><p>In the territory of the Xuanyuan Divine Clan, in the starry sky, Ning Zhiyuan looked worried as he watched the steward Ning recover from his injuries.</p><p></p><p>"Steward Ning, is your injury not serious?"</p><p></p><p>Steward Ning shook his head, his pale face slightly fatigued, but his eyes still had a bright light, indicating he was not in grave danger.</p><p></p><p>"I won't die anytime soon, with the divine elixir of the Ning family to aid my recovery, I should be able to recover within two days.</p><p></p><p>What I'm worried about now is whether the people of the other three divine clans will come here. If they come at this time, we won't be able to defeat them.</p><p></p><p>This time, apart from me, the Ning family has brought three divine realm experts, but they are only at the first level of the divine realm, only I am at the fourth level.</p><p></p><p>Young master, you must be vigilant."</p><p></p><p>Ning Zhiyuan nodded.</p><p></p><p>"Don't worry, I'm aware of the situation."</p><p></p><p>Steward Ning sighed and said:</p><p></p><p>"I didn't expect this place to produce such a powerful beast lord, whose strength is comparable to the fifth level of the divine realm. If I hadn't cultivated the five-star divine art gifted by the family patriarch, which happens to be of the fire attribute and can counter him, we would have been in big trouble this time.</p><p></p><p>Indeed, even in this remote place, there may still appear one or two extraordinary experts.</p><p></p><p>No matter where, we cannot be careless."</p><p></p><p>"What Steward Ning said is right, you should rest well! I'll go check on the progress of the divine tomb excavation."</p><p></p><p>Ning Zhiyuan left Steward Ning's room and went to the deck, where a maid quickly approached him.</p><p></p><p>"Young master, we have trouble. We just detected that many powerful experts have arrived in this star domain, right where the three divine clans were previously stationed."</p><p></p><p>Ning Zhiyuan's eyes narrowed slightly.</p><p></p><p>"They arrived so quickly? Where are our people now? How long will it take for them to get here?"</p><p></p><p>"To answer your question, young master, our preliminary estimate is that it will take at least three more days for our people to arrive."</p><p></p><p>Ning Zhiyuan took a deep breath, feeling a sense of unease in his chest.</p><p></p><p>"Three days? I hope nothing goes wrong during these three days."</p><p></p><p>On the other side, near the camp of the three divine clans, accompanied by a distortion in space, a huge fish shadow appeared in this area.</p><p></p><p>Its body was riddled with large holes, revealing the orange flesh with white patterns that emitted a silvery-white luster, extremely alluring.</p><p></p><p>"Damn it! This is a great humiliation! I, a mighty beast lord, actually almost lost my life to a bunch of these damn humans.</p><p></p><p>However, these bastards, although they look a bit like the Ancestor Dragon, with the same yellow skin and black eyes, why do I feel their strength is so powerful? Could it be that the current humans have all developed to such a strong level? Their martial dao culture has actually evolved to such a profound degree, truly terrifying.</p><p></p><p>Just the humans in this little corner of the starry sky are already so formidable, I don't even want to know how many terrifying existences there are in the human world on the ground.</p><p></p><p>It seems I still can't go to the human world, I'd better go back to my old lair first, and recover from my injuries.</p><p></p><p>At least I've eaten a few of their emperor realm experts, hehe, so it's not a total loss."</p><p></p><p>With a sweep of his giant tail, he instantly appeared thousands of miles away, this was the place where he had been sealed, his old lair, and also the previous camp of the three divine clans.</p><p></p><p>However, when he returned, the giant fish was immediately dumbfounded.</p><p></p><p>"What's going on? Where's my lair? What's with these people? Why did they just come and occupy my lair?"</p><p></p><p>Here is the full English translation of the Chinese excerpt:</p><p></p><p>"What? Occupied?</p><p></p><p>Fuck! This is too much bullying! I, the Sovereign Beast, am a mighty existence, yet you damned human race have come and taken over my lair. Do you really think I'm just a sick cat that you can bully? Fuck, I'll kill you all!"</p><p></p><p>He let out a furious roar and instantly charged into the group of opponents.</p><p></p><p>Boom! The Three Divine Tribes, who were in the process of rebuilding their fortress, were completely unprepared for the sudden appearance of a Sovereign Beast-level giant fish, let alone the fact that it directly attacked them without hesitation.</p><p></p><p>Since they had no time to defend themselves, nearly a hundred of them were blasted, with limbs torn off and legs broken, by the tremendous impact force. The shockwave even split a star island hundreds of miles in diameter into two.</p><p></p><p>"What's going on?"</p><p>"Enemy attack! We're under attack!"</p><p>"Quickly, report to the leaders."</p><p></p><p>In the next second, a golden light shot up towards the fleet above.</p><p></p><p>The giant fish didn't realize what had happened. He only knew that his previous strike had killed dozens of Emperor Realm cultivators and severely injured dozens more, all of whose vital energy he had devoured to replenish his own.</p><p></p><p>Delightful.</p><p></p><p>At this rate, it wouldn't be long before he fully recovered from the injuries inflicted by the previous group.</p><p></p><p>Since they had severely injured his body, his current strength was only at the peak of Deity Realm Fourth Stage, which was truly unsatisfactory.</p><p></p><p>He must quickly heal his wounds and restore his peak Deity Realm Fifth Stage power. Only then could he ensure his survival in this perilous starry sky.</p><p></p><p>"Haha, all of you die! All of you die! Taste the consequences of invading my lair!"</p><p></p><p>The giant fish frantically attacked the Three Divine Tribes, devouring one figure after another.</p><p></p><p>Even though his body was severely injured and he could only display Deity Realm Fourth Stage strength, this power was still a terrifying threat to the Emperor Realm cultivators of the Three Divine Tribes. With this strength, he could run rampant here.</p><p></p><p>But the good times didn't last long, as soon, from the fleet of spiritual energy ships above, several figures rapidly descended.</p><p></p><p>Eleven of them, each at the Deity Realm!</p><p></p><p>"What vile beast dares to run amok here? Do you really think the Three Divine Tribes are easy to bully?"</p><p></p><p>"Vile beast, cease your arrogance!"</p><p></p><p>The experts of the Three Divine Tribes had not even landed yet, but their attacks were already raining down.</p><p></p><p>Endless beams of light fell from the sky, each infused with terrifying and dreadful power, bombarding the rampaging giant fish below.</p><p></p><p>Boom, boom, boom. The number of opponents was simply too many, and the attacks too numerous.</p><p></p><p>The bombardment was so intense that even the mighty giant fish could not possibly avoid them all, and was instantly blasted by several Emperor Realm and low-level Deity Realm techniques.</p><p></p><p>Massive bloody holes exploded all over its body.</p><p></p><p>The giant fish had just devoured so many Emperor Realm cultivators, and its injuries had mostly healed, but now the wounds were even more severe. Even its tail was blasted off, hanging by just a strip of skin, like a lantern.</p><p></p><p>"Damn it! These shameless humans! You all have no sense of honor. Other than ganging up, it's just more ganging up.</p><p></p><p>Just now, that group of people ganged up on me, and I could accept that. But you bastards who have stolen my lair, you actually have the nerve to gang up on me as well.</p><p></p><p>Just wait, I'll be back for you."</p><p></p><p>With that, the giant fish gritted its teeth, swung its broken, massive tail, and instantly transformed into a beam of light, fleeing in another direction.</p><p></p><p>The experts of the Three Divine Tribes, seeing the tragic scene below, were filled with raging fury, their eyes gleaming with murderous intent.</p><p></p><p>"That damned beast! It actually killed so many of us! We absolutely cannot let it go."</p><p></p><p>"Hold on! What if this is a ploy to lure us away? It has already suffered heavy injuries and can't display much power. One Deity Realm expert from each tribe should be enough to pursue it."</p><p></p><p>"Well said. The Winged Divine Tribe will send Ekus."</p><p></p><p>"The Thunder Divine Tribe will send Alberd."</p><p></p><p>"The Titan Divine Tribe will send Cassya."</p><p></p><p>The three named Deity Realm experts instantly transformed into three beams of light and rushed off in pursuit of the giant fish.</p><p></p><p>After they left, a Winged Divine Tribe Emperor Realm expert, with one arm broken, brought a tattered robe to the space above.</p><p></p><p>"My lords, this is what I risked my life to snatch from that fish's mouth."</p><p></p><p>The others took the robe and their pupils immediately constricted.</p><p></p><p>"This robe belongs to the Xuanyuan Divine Tribe!"</p><p></p><p>"Could it be that this incident is related to the Xuanyuan Divine Tribe?"</p><p></p><p>"Well, well, Xuanyuan Divine Tribe, do you think you're the top dog in the starry sky that no one dares to provoke? We haven't even investigated this matter thoroughly, and you've already gotten restless."</p>

        <h1>Chapter 391</h1>
        <div class="content">
            <p>Here is the full English translation of the Chinese excerpt:</p><p></p><p>Could it really be him? If it is him, has this guy reached the Slay God realm of cultivation?</p><p></p><p>Or is he at the half-step Slay God realm?</p><p></p><p>Oh my god!</p><p></p><p>In this extremely remote and barren place, where the spiritual energy is thinner than in the center of the starry sky, and the resources are far from enough, such a high-level existence has actually emerged.</p><p></p><p>It's like putting a piece of gold in a pile of coal, and it still shines brightly, illuminating everything around it.</p><p></p><p>How monstrous is his talent? Ye Xiao grabbed the Dragon Bird and immediately unleashed the Yin-Yang Escape Technique, instantly returning to his own underground cellar.</p><p></p><p>Seeing the Dragon Bird being captured, the Gloomy Wolf directly fainted on the spot.</p><p></p><p>Plop. He fell heavily to the ground.</p><p></p><p>As for the other star beasts, they directly descended into madness.</p><p></p><p>"This is impossible, I don't believe it, how could this be? Dragon Bird senior, that is a Slay God level existence!"</p><p></p><p>Dragon Blood Tiger plopped down on the ground, Lan Xin Shuixian's body went weak, and if she hadn't been leaning on Xia Shen, she might have collapsed as well.</p><p></p><p>It's over!</p><p></p><p>Everything is over now.</p><p></p><p>All the powerful star beasts that the master had raised have been wiped out, not a single one left.</p><p></p><p>Big Fish couldn't help but click his tongue repeatedly.</p><p></p><p>This Ye Xiao is truly terrifying!</p><p></p><p>When he first encountered him, he didn't seem so powerful.</p><p></p><p>But how long has it been? His strength has already risen to this level.</p><p></p><p>At this moment, Big Fish is not only terrified of Ye Xiao's terrifying strength, but he has even started to be terrified of Ye Xiao's terrifying talent.</p><p></p><p>Is this guy really human?</p><p></p><p>Ye Xiao didn't have as many thoughts as they did. After bringing the Dragon Bird back, he immediately threw it aside and unleashed the Great Dao Divine Sense to directly scan Lan Xin Shuixian's soul.</p><p></p><p>The Shrimp God beside Lan Xin Shuixian immediately sensed something and loudly warned, "Little Shuixian, quickly defend yourself, he wants to search your memories."</p><p></p><p>Lan Xin Shuixian snapped out of her daze and immediately tried to mobilize her spiritual power to resist Ye Xiao.</p><p></p><p>But unfortunately, her spiritual power was no match for Ye Xiao's, and with her mind shaken after seeing the Dragon Bird being captured by Ye Xiao, that thin layer of spiritual power was instantly pierced through by Ye Xiao.</p><p></p><p>"Ah~!"</p><p></p><p>Accompanied by a heart-stirring cry, two streams of clear tears fell from the corners of her eyes.</p><p></p><p>I'm sorry, master, I really tried my best, but I really couldn't do it. He's too strong! I couldn't hold on.</p><p></p><p>After a moment, Ye Xiao's face turned ice-cold.</p><p></p><p>Indeed!</p><p></p><p>He knew something was not right here. These beast lords were all rare existences that only appeared once in a thousand years.</p><p></p><p>At least on this Canglang Star Domain side, they were very hard to come by.</p><p></p><p>This place is located at the edge of the starry sky, extremely remote, with scarce resources and thin spiritual energy.</p><p></p><p>It was impossible for such high-level existences to emerge here.</p><p></p><p>If they had migrated from a distant place, there was only one explanation.</p><p></p><p>And now, after searching Lan Xin Shuixian's memories, Ye Xiao was 100% clear about the past and present of the situation.</p><p></p><p>"Cloud Family! Cloud Water! You are really ruthless. I've never met you before. You don't even know my name. I've never offended you, yet you want to kill me!"</p><p></p><p>Just because of his extraordinary talent!</p><p></p><p>Haha, indeed, even within the same clan, not everyone can be a good person.</p><p></p><p>Even in the Xuanyuan Divine Clan, there will be some stupid and evil maggot-like existences! No wonder the ancestors had specially warned him before not to trust everyone in the Xuanyuan Divine Clan.</p><p></p><p>Fortunately, he hadn't revealed his identity before, otherwise the other party might not have sent troops to search for him, but directly taken action to annihilate him.</p><p></p><p>Ye Xiao clenched his fist, and a cold glint flashed in his eyes.</p><p></p><p>It seems that after his cultivation breaks through to the Slay God realm, he needs to go find this Cloud Family and have a good chat with them.</p><p></p><p>As for now, let him use Cloud Water's star pets to help boost his strength a bit!</p><p></p><p>Thinking this, he raised his hand and two sword beams slashed off the Dragon Bird's wings! He'll use the Dragon Bird's wings to refine a concoction. Its blood qi is extremely rich at the Slay God realm, which can greatly enhance his own blood qi.</p><p></p><p>Probably it won't be long before he can raise his blood qi to the Slay God realm level.</p><p></p><p>On the Cloud Family's spiritual energy ship, the moment the Dragon Bird's aura disappeared, Cloud Water suddenly spat out a mouthful of fresh blood! He staggered back two steps.</p><p></p><p>"Elder Cloud!"</p><p></p><p>Cloud Zhen Wu immediately stepped forward and supported him. "Elder Cloud, are you alright? Please don't scare me."</p><p></p><p>Cloud Water cried bitterly, his face deathly pale, beating his chest and stomping his feet.</p><p></p><p>"My thousands of years of efforts have now been completely destroyed! Completely destroyed! The Dragon Bird is gone! The Dragon Bird is gone!"</p><p></p><p>Cloud Zhen Wu was shocked.</p><p></p><p>The Dragon Bird is really gone!</p><p></p><p>Although he had some premonitions before, he still couldn't quite believe it.</p><p></p><p>Here is the full English translation of the Chinese excerpt:</p><p></p><p>He had tested it before, but at that time, he also thought that the Dragon Bird was after all at the Deicide Realm, and moreover, because the bloodline power within him was extremely strong, he should still have a certain chance.</p><p></p><p>At least, the problem of escaping back should not be too great.</p><p></p><p>Unexpectedly, even he had been completely defeated.</p><p></p><p>Seeing the tearful Cloud Water, he couldn't help but sigh.</p><p></p><p>"Alas! If I had known it would be like this, why did I do it in the first place? Just accept it calmly. Right now, we have no way to go and look for them. Let's wait a few days, and I'll go out and see if there are any clues."</p><p></p><p>Cloud Water nodded.</p><p></p><p>"That's all we can do. Hopefully, they are still alive, just captured by someone else. If that's the case, this old man may still be able to redeem them."</p><p></p><p>Yun Zhenwu couldn't help but bitterly smile.</p><p></p><p>How easy could that be? As a Beast Tamer, since the connection between him and the Star Beast had been completely severed, it could basically be determined that this Star Beast had already died.</p><p></p><p>However, Cloud Water was currently in a state of grief, and he didn't want to overly stimulate him.</p><p></p><p>Time passed quickly, and in the blink of an eye, a night had disappeared without a trace.</p><p></p><p>The next day, Ye Xiao went to work refreshed.</p><p></p><p>The blood qi within him had already reached an extreme limit, which meant that he could break through to the Deicide Realm at any time.</p><p></p><p>However, Ye Xiao felt that it was not that easy.</p><p></p><p>Breaking through to the Deicide Realm always had an invisible and elusive obstacle, making him feel as if he was in a white mist, searching and searching but unable to find the way out.</p><p></p><p>Ye Xiao had a vague understanding that this should be related to his own comprehension.</p><p></p><p>After all, he had never had any experience in the Deicide Realm, and he had not even read a single book about the spiritual descriptions of the Deicide Realm.</p><p></p><p>Without any experience, relying solely on his own exploration to talk about breaking through, to be honest, was indeed a bit unrealistic.</p><p></p><p>But he had no choice. Even in the XuanYuan Clan, there were people who wanted to kill him, and in such a situation, he could not possibly expose his identity and go to the elders of the XuanYuan Clan to resolve the confusion in his heart.</p><p></p><p>The previous Divine King's Tomb was a bit of a pity, as the other party was merely a Healing Master, and his martial dao comprehension was almost zero.</p><p></p><p>So this resulted in him not being able to gain any martial dao comprehension from the other party.</p><p></p><p>Otherwise, not only would breaking through to the Deicide Realm not be a problem, even breaking through to the next level, the Divine King Realm, would not be too much trouble.</p><p></p><p>Forget it, for now, he should just focus on fusing the Treasure Art, and when the opportunity comes, he can talk about improving his realm.</p><p></p><p>When Ye Xiao arrived at the library, before he even prepared to start reading, his colleagues around him had already started discussing.</p><p></p><p>"Do you all know? Another Divine King's Tomb has been discovered in the starry sky!"</p><p></p><p>"Who doesn't know? This matter has been widely discussed for a long time."</p><p></p><p>"The Divine King's Tomb is extremely precious, and the resources inside are countless. The last time a Divine King's Tomb was found, because there was only one bottle of Divine Water, it was snatched away by the Alliance of a Hundred Tribes, and we didn't get any benefits."</p><p></p><p>"So this time, the major families of the XuanYuan Clan are determined to obtain this Divine King's Tomb."</p><p></p><p>"Unfortunately, our strength is too low. Even if we go to the starry sky, we can only participate in the excavation of those extremely ordinary tombs, and have no chance to approach the Divine King's Tomb.</p><p></p><p>If it were free for me to go and dig, just to take a look, I would be willing!"</p><p></p><p>"Don't be ridiculous. Look at yourself. Even if you go there to dig, they won't let you. And with your cultivation, can you even dig it up?"</p><p></p><p>The crowd burst into laughter.</p><p></p><p>In the corner, Ye Xiao, who was reading a book, slightly raised his eyebrows.</p><p></p><p>"Another Divine King's Tomb?"</p><p></p><p>He had a vague sense of excitement, although he didn't know whether this Divine King's Tomb was for cultivating martial dao or something else, but at least he shouldn't be a Healing Master.</p><p></p><p>The overlord of the Ancient Divine Nation would not possibly cultivate a bunch of Healing Masters, right?</p><p></p><p>This world is ultimately a world of the survival of the fittest, where martial dao is the way. If the other party is a Divine King who cultivates martial dao, that would be a great gift for him.</p><p></p><p>At least, there must be some insights into the cultivation of martial dao, which would be enough to help him break through the last barrier of this realm and become a Deicide Realm expert! In that case, he wouldn't need to look for martial dao insights for a long time in the future.</p><p></p><p>It seems that he should find a way to go and take a look in the starry sky.</p><p></p><p>Tonight, he should find an opportunity to go and take a look.</p><p></p><p>On the other side, in the starry sky, the forces of the XuanYuan Clan and the Alliance of a Hundred Tribes clashed again.</p><p></p><p>"Young masters of the XuanYuan families, long time no see! Unexpectedly, we found the second Divine King's Tomb so quickly!"</p><p></p><p>Ning Zhiyuan and the others had a rather unpleasant expression on their faces.</p><p></p><p>"Zhu Chunqiu. You guys shouldn't go too far."</p>

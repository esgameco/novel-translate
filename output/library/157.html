        <h1>Chapter 157</h1>
        <div class="content">
            <p>Here is the full English translation of the Chinese excerpt:</p><p></p><p>Ye Xiao hung up the phone, and Illusion Glazed also flew up into the sky.</p><p></p><p>She looked at the golden phoenix in Ye Xiao's hand and couldn't help but swallow, her eyes shining with envy.</p><p></p><p>Since following Ye Xiao, she had become increasingly picky about star beast ingredients, and her discernment had also improved.</p><p></p><p>This phoenix, just by looking at its feathers, she could guess that it had grown stronger, and its taste would certainly be even better.</p><p></p><p>Another delicacy was coming her way.</p><p></p><p>"Master, the star beasts below have all been wiped out by the Jia family. Not a single one is left. All the star cores have been dug out, and it's impossible to revive them, hehe hehe."</p><p></p><p>Ye Xiao nodded, then put the phoenix's body and the star cores brought by Illusion Glazed into his spatial ring, and then began to simultaneously cast the Supplementing the Heavens Art, the Stellar Incantation, and the Extreme Healing Art, three healing arts.</p><p></p><p>A pure golden light began to radiate from him, a powerful yet gentle healing power spreading like mist towards the city below, quickly healing the injured martial artists and those who had just died.</p><p></p><p>At first, the martial artists below were completely bewildered when they saw the golden light, not knowing what was happening.</p><p></p><p>Until they saw the injured and fallen martial artists healing and rising from the ground.</p><p></p><p>"Huh? My injury is healed, my arm has grown back."</p><p></p><p>"Me too, my broken leg has mended."</p><p></p><p>"Wasn't I dead? How am I alive again? What is going on?"</p><p></p><p>Seeing these people who had been dead or seriously injured now fully recovered, everyone was stunned.</p><p></p><p>What kind of power was this?</p><p></p><p>To simultaneously revive and heal over a million people.</p><p></p><p>No, this was a miracle.</p><p></p><p>A true miracle in the truest sense!</p><p></p><p>Only a god could accomplish this.</p><p></p><p>Even in this world of high martial arts.</p><p></p><p>"City Lord, what is happening? The dead have revived, and the injured martial artists have all healed."</p><p></p><p>The City Lord of Luo Feng City, looking at the golden light in the sky, had a deep longing in his eyes.</p><p></p><p>"Could it be... the Savior of Humanity has appeared?"</p><p></p><p>The healing lasted for a full minute, and afterwards, Ye Xiao was slightly out of breath, his face a little pale.</p><p></p><p>Simultaneously casting three healing imperial arts, and covering an entire massive city with over a million people, even though he was now at the Xiantian Eighth Realm and had the imperial art-level heart cultivation of the Purple Twinkling Sea to support him, he could still feel a slight strain.</p><p></p><p>However, after stopping the healing arts and with the Purple Twinkling Sea absorbing spiritual energy, Ye Xiao's complexion quickly returned to normal a few breaths later.</p><p></p><p>Seeing that there were no more injured below, Ye Xiao did not waste any more time. With a thought, he activated the Divine Will Incantation and vanished into the starry sky.</p><p></p><p>A few breaths later, Ye Xiao appeared in a mountain forest hundreds of miles away.</p><p></p><p>Arriving at this mountain forest, he took the phoenix's body out of his storage ring and placed it gently on the ground.</p><p></p><p>Since the phoenix's body was intact, he only needed to use the Supplementing the Heavens Art to make a minor repair, and he could easily revive it.</p><p></p><p>"Cluck cluck cluck."</p><p></p><p>The phoenix let out a few sleepy murmurs as it woke from its daze.</p><p></p><p>"Σ(°△°\|\|\|)︴!"</p><p></p><p>When she saw Ye Xiao and Illusion Glazed, the phoenix completely collapsed.</p><p></p><p>Damn it, these two abnormal master and servant had come again to harvest her.</p><p></p><p>Constantly reviving and healing her, then repeatedly cutting off her wings and chicken legs.</p><p></p><p>"Aren't you two done yet? At least change to another star beast! Even a chicken would do! Why do you have to be so cruel? Why are you only targeting me, a single chicken?"</p><p></p><p>"Because we can't find any other divine fowl."</p><p></p><p>With that, Ye Xiao waved his hand, sending two sword beams to slice off the phoenix's wings and hand them to Illusion Glazed.</p><p></p><p>"Glazed, light the fire."</p><p></p><p>"As you command."</p><p></p><p>Illusion Glazed excitedly built a fire, plucked the feathers off the chicken wings, and began to rapidly roast them using spiritual energy to fuel the flames.</p><p></p><p>Meanwhile, Ye Xiao once again used his healing arts to repair the phoenix's body.</p><p></p><p>The phoenix had completely collapsed. The pain from last time had already terrified her, and now the fear had not even been healed, and in the blink of an eye, this guy was back.</p><p></p><p>"Freak! You two are all freaks, beasts without humanity!"</p><p></p><p>"I curse you two to have a bad end!"</p><p></p><p>The phoenix cursed endlessly, but Ye Xiao paid her no mind, skillfully cutting the chicken wings and storing them in his spatial ring, then using healing arts to treat her.</p><p></p><p>This cycle repeated for half an incense stick, and when the first pair of the phoenix's wings was completely roasted, she could no longer endure.</p><p></p><p>No matter how fiercely she cursed, Ye Xiao simply ignored her, and his chicken-wing cutting skills even became more and more rough. From initially slicing through in an instant, he was now sawing back and forth, the excruciating pain making the phoenix admit that she could no longer withstand it.</p><p></p><p>It was too painful.</p><p></p><p>Although martial artists and star beasts would continuously strengthen their willpower as their cultivation rose, their perception of pain would also increase accordingly.</p><p></p><p>The two combined, even a deity couldn't endure it.</p><p></p><p>"I surrender, I surrender, don't do it anymore..."</p><p></p><p>Here is the full English translation of the Chinese excerpt:</p><p></p><p>"You've clipped my wings."</p><p></p><p>Ye Xiao paused his actions and spoke indifferently:</p><p></p><p>"What can you offer in exchange?"</p><p></p><p>Ji Feng looked at Ye Xiao, pondered for a moment, and gritted her teeth, saying:</p><p></p><p>"At worst, I'll serve you a bit. You humans all like beautiful women, don't you?"</p><p></p><p>Ye Xiao shook his head.</p><p></p><p>"I'm not interested in that."</p><p></p><p>"Then what do you want?"</p><p></p><p>"I heard you say before that you have a few companions who are also Shen Zong-level spirit beasts, all of whom escaped from the seals in the Nine Provinces?"</p><p></p><p>A look of vigilance suddenly appeared on Ji Feng's face.</p><p></p><p>"What are you planning to do?"</p><p></p><p>"I don't want to do anything. Just take me to them, and I'll spare you."</p><p></p><p>"Dream on!"</p><p></p><p>Ji Feng immediately burst into angry curses.</p><p></p><p>She finally realized what Ye Xiao was planning.</p><p></p><p>She had been suspicious earlier about why Ye Xiao had suddenly relaxed his guard, giving her a chance to escape.</p><p></p><p>Now she understood - Ye Xiao had been planning all along to capture all the Shen Zong-level spirit beasts.</p><p></p><p>This despicable, cunning human, wanting her to betray the spirit beast clan - no way.</p><p></p><p>Ye Xiao wasn't angry. Ji Feng's reaction was within his expectations.</p><p></p><p>He could also use the Taixuan Tiangong to search her memories.</p><p></p><p>However, Ji Feng was a Shen Zong-level being, and she had just absorbed the remnant spiritual energy of a Fire Phoenix, further enhancing her spiritual power. Forcibly attacking her spiritually would be more troublesome than repeatedly interrogating her physical body.</p><p></p><p>But since she was being unreasonable, he didn't mind the extra trouble.</p><p></p><p>Spiritual attacks were far more agonizing than physical ones.</p><p></p><p>Ji Feng was cursing when she suddenly felt an overwhelming spiritual pressure suddenly invade her mind without warning.</p><p></p><p>This sudden assault almost succeeded, but it still fell short.</p><p></p><p>"Ah - what are you trying to do?!"</p><p></p><p>Ji Feng couldn't help but cry out in alarm, her entire being sinking into even more intense terror.</p><p></p><p>She immediately unleashed her own spiritual power to defend, trying to construct a protective wall around her memories.</p><p></p><p>Ye Xiao's spiritual power manifested as a long spear, slamming forcefully against the wall.</p><p></p><p>"Boom!"</p><p></p><p>Ji Feng's body trembled, Ye Xiao's attack was so fierce that for a moment, her mind nearly collapsed.</p><p></p><p>But she still gritted her teeth and resisted with all her might.</p><p></p><p>"I will never let you in!"</p><p></p><p>Ye Xiao was not in a hurry. If one wave didn't work, he would try another.</p><p></p><p>The Taixuan Tiangong accelerated, his spiritual power continuously condensing and relentlessly bombarding Ji Feng's spiritual defenses.</p><p></p><p>Each impact brought Ji Feng's spiritual power dangerously close to breaking.</p><p></p><p>But she still clung on, refusing to give in.</p><p></p><p>She absolutely could not let Ye Xiao scan her memories.</p><p></p><p>Otherwise, the other Shen Zong-level spirit beasts would all be doomed, a devastating blow to the spirit beast clan.</p><p></p><p>However, Ye Xiao was a Xiantian Eighth Rank cultivator with the spiritual Emperor Art Taixuan Tiangong. Even with the Fire Phoenix bloodline, Ji Feng could not withstand him.</p><p></p><p>After several rounds of this tug-of-war, Ji Feng felt her spiritual power reaching its limit. Ye Xiao's next attack would shatter her spiritual defenses completely.</p><p></p><p>In her despair, she gritted her teeth.</p><p></p><p>"I'd rather die than let you have your way!"</p><p></p><p>Finally, the thing Ye Xiao feared happened - she detonated her spiritual power in self-destruction.</p><p></p><p>In this way, her memories would be completely destroyed, and Ye Xiao would no longer be able to obtain them to ambush the other Shen Zong spirit beasts.</p><p></p><p>The spiritual explosion lasted only a second, and in that instant, Ji Feng's soul was shattered.</p><p></p><p>The powerful spiritual shockwave even tried to counterattack along Ye Xiao's spiritual path, trying to strike and damage Ye Xiao's spiritual power.</p><p></p><p>But unfortunately, Ji Feng's strength was far inferior to Ye Xiao's. She couldn't even resist Ye Xiao's spiritual power, let alone attack Ye Xiao's spiritual power.</p><p></p><p>And Ye Xiao had been on guard, prepared for her desperate retaliation.</p><p></p><p>So Ji Feng couldn't hurt Ye Xiao's spiritual power at all.</p><p></p><p>Ye Xiao sighed softly.</p><p></p><p>"Why did it have to come to this?"</p><p></p><p>He then used his ultimate healing art to begin repairing Ji Feng's soul.</p><p></p><p>The Supplementary Heaven Art and the Chenxing Technique could also do this, but Ye Xiao had had enough of those and wanted to try a different healing art.</p><p></p><p>Ji Feng's remaining consciousness, though sorrowful, also felt a bit relieved.</p><p></p><p>At least she had managed to protect the other Shen Zong-level spirit beasts, preventing the complete downfall of the spirit beasts in the Nine Provinces!</p><p></p><p>Sacrificing herself was not too much of a loss.</p><p></p><p>Farewell, my friends. The spirit beasts will ultimately achieve victory!</p><p></p><p>The humans will be trampled under our feet!</p><p></p><p>History will belong to us in the end!</p><p></p><p>Long live the spirit beast clan! Long live!</p>

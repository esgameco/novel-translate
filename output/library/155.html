        <h1>Chapter 155</h1>
        <div class="content">
            <p>Here is the full English translation of the Chinese excerpt:</p><p></p><p>Huan Liuli immediately rushed out to clear the area. </p><p></p><p>As a natural fifth-rank grand master, dealing with these small fry was very simple for her.</p><p></p><p>The combat style of the Shadow Cat was often to interfere with the opponent's mobility through spiritual power. Under the control of powerful spiritual power, the opponent was completely unable to resist, and then a throat-sealing move would follow.</p><p></p><p>As for Ye Xiao, he began to fully unleash the Taixuan Tiangong, analyzing the initial position of the Phoenix bloodline.</p><p></p><p>This ancient alien species, its growth potential was several times stronger than that of the dragon-level bloodline.</p><p></p><p>When this Phoenix was slain, its cultivation had probably already surpassed the seventh rank and even the eighth rank of the natural realm.</p><p></p><p>Now, after falling for many years and being sealed, its strength was definitely not what it used to be, but its spiritual power, which was the embodiment of its will, was unquestionably first-class.</p><p></p><p>For the Phoenix, also known as the Immortal Bird, its willpower was absolutely top-notch.</p><p></p><p>Therefore, the spiritual power of this fallen Phoenix was sufficient to cover the entire Luofeng City, able to shield Ye Xiao's Taixuan Tiangong from accurately locating Jifeng.</p><p></p><p>During this period, there would certainly be many human casualties or deaths in Luofeng City.</p><p></p><p>The assistance of the Shadow Cat could only alleviate some of it, but could not stop all the alien beasts, after all, the entire city was too large.</p><p></p><p>But it didn't matter, Ye Xiao could use the補天術 to heal and revive everyone. As long as he could repair them in the end, the current injuries and deaths would not matter much.</p><p></p><p>In a secluded corner of the underground of Luofeng City, Jifeng had already recovered her alien beast form and was soaking in a burning pool of fresh blood.</p><p></p><p>This fresh blood was filled with intense fire elemental energy, constantly burning Jifeng's body, scorching all the feathers on her, and then regenerating them, with each new growth becoming more and more brilliant and fiery red.</p><p></p><p>It seemed that she had been upgraded from a low-end to a high-end model, from a chicken to a Phoenix.</p><p></p><p>Feeling the surging bloodline power within her, Jifeng let out a cackling laugh.</p><p></p><p>"Hahaha, this time, thanks to the Phoenix senior's gift of her lifeblood, with the Phoenix senior's lifeblood, my bloodline will be washed and enhanced again. </p><p></p><p>My bloodline power will be completely upgraded from sub-dragon level to dragon level, and my potential will be amplified once more.</p><p></p><p>When that time comes, I will definitely be able to break through my current realm.</p><p></p><p>That bastard in Jianghai City, you just wait, I will definitely tear you to pieces.</p><p></p><p>And Noel Fiss, as a fellow alien beast, you betrayed your own kind and harmed your fellow alien beasts, I will never let you off. </p><p></p><p>I will turn you into a grilled octopus, a side dish for drinking!"</p><p></p><p>After saying that, she began to absorb the remaining Phoenix lifeblood even more quickly.</p><p></p><p>At this moment, Luofeng City had fallen into a state of chaos, with the alien beasts that had been lurking since the Seven-Star Convergence now all crazily rushing towards the warriors in the city.</p><p></p><p>The warriors were caught off guard, and suffered a lot of injuries in a short period of time.</p><p></p><p>The Luofeng City Lord's Mansion had descended into complete chaos.</p><p></p><p>"What has provoked these alien beasts? The Seven-Star Convergence has already passed, why have they become so frenzied?"</p><p></p><p>The Luofeng City Lord was shivering with anger.</p><p></p><p>Luofeng City was located near the Qin State border, with very few high-level warriors, far inferior to the major cities. Facing this level of alien beast turmoil, it was difficult to suppress them easily. This time, it would definitely be a heavy blow.</p><p></p><p>"Lord, the alien beasts have spread, and many people have been killed and injured."</p><p></p><p>"Deploy all the warriors, notify the Library, the Defense Force, and the three grand masters of the Luofeng City Martial Arts Academy, and have all the combat-capable warriors participate in the battle.</p><p></p><p>Also, immediately seek aid from the nearby cities."</p><p></p><p>"Shouldn't we notify Qin State first?"</p><p></p><p>"Qin State is too far away, notifying them won't be of any use, first seek aid, then notify Qin State."</p><p></p><p>After saying that, the Luofeng City Lord took off his suit and picked up a sword, preparing to leave.</p><p></p><p>The secretary exclaimed, "Lord, what are you doing? As the Lord, you shouldn't participate in the battle."</p><p></p><p>"Precisely because I am the Lord, I must fight. Even if I die, I must die in front of the common people!</p><p></p><p>If I die, you will be the acting Lord, you know the work, just send a death report to Qin State."</p><p></p><p>With that, he kicked open the door and strode out.</p><p></p><p>"The Defense Force of the Lord's Mansion, come with me!"</p><p></p><p>On the streets, the alien beasts were already countless, and the entire view was a battlefield.</p><p></p><p>However, the alien beasts clearly had the advantage in strength, with the magnetic field of the Phoenix bloodline boosting their power, which had begun to rise crazily in the short term, no weaker than the Seven-Star Convergence.</p><p></p><p>"Charge forward and kill all the alien beasts, protect the people of Luofeng City!"</p><p></p><p>The Lord, wielding a steel sword, led the Defense Force of the Lord's Mansion into the streets, joining the battle.</p><p></p><p>His strength was not strong, only at the eighth rank of the posterior celestial realm, as the Lord was a civil official who usually did not participate in battles.</p><p></p><p>But seeing his participation, the warriors of Luofeng City were inspired, and began to fight back fiercely, their morale soaring.</p><p></p><p>"For Luofeng City, kill!"</p><p></p><p>The battle had entered a white-hot stage, with a surging fighting spirit.</p><p></p><p>But this situation did not last long.</p><p></p><p>Here is the full English translation of the Chinese excerpt:</p><p></p><p>It had been going on for too long.</p><p></p><p>The gap in combat power was simply too great, and the number of people could not change that.</p><p></p><p>In less than three minutes, the human cultivators were suppressed.</p><p></p><p>"City Lord, we can't hold out like this. The star beasts are too strong, their strength seems to have been enhanced."</p><p></p><p>"Don't try to fight them head-on, use the buildings to maneuver and adopt guerrilla tactics."</p><p></p><p>"It's too late, we're surrounded."</p><p></p><p>"Damn it, follow me and I'll cut a bloody path out of here."</p><p></p><p>But at that moment, the star beasts that had been furiously attacking suddenly seemed to be disrupted, their movements freezing for a brief moment, only about 0.01 seconds.</p><p></p><p>Then, a black lightning bolt flashed across, moving at a speed that defied description.</p><p></p><p>In an instant, hundreds of star beasts were struck at the throat.</p><p></p><p>Before the crowd could even see clearly what had happened, the severed beast heads were sent flying, spraying blood like hundreds of bloody fireworks blossoming.</p><p></p><p>The gruesome scene had a strange, haunting beauty that left everyone dumbfounded.</p><p></p><p>"What just happened?" </p><p></p><p>The City Lord couldn't help but ask, puzzled.</p><p></p><p>The other defense team members responded with confusion, "I-I don't know, I couldn't see clearly. Was that... a big black rat?"</p><p></p><p>"It must have been a star beast, and a high-ranking one at that. Otherwise, it would be impossible to instantly annihilate hundreds of them like that."</p><p></p><p>Everyone fell into a deathly silence once more.</p><p></p><p>A star beast at the Grandmaster level? Where did it come from? </p><p></p><p>And why did it help them? Wasn't it a star beast itself? Why did it kill the other star beasts instead of the humans?</p><p></p><p>In that moment, everyone was utterly bewildered.</p><p></p><p>On the other side, in the park, Ye Xiao was rapidly activating the Taixuan Heavenly Might, which spread out like radio waves from his body, sweeping across every corner of Luofeng City, over and over again.</p><p></p><p>The mental calculation speed of the Taixuan Heavenly Might was incredibly fast, exceeding a thousand times per second.</p><p></p><p>A thousand times per second, scanning the entirety of Luofeng City - what a concept! It meant that in a single second, Ye Xiao could count the number of cells released by every man in Luofeng City, and do so a thousand times over!</p><p></p><p>But each scan was different, with a certain degree of frequency variation, because without this, he would never be able to find the spiritual frequency of the Phoenix, and thus break through the spiritual power limit to track down Jifeng.</p><p></p><p>There were countless variations in spiritual power frequencies, which was why it was so difficult for ordinary people to cultivate it. </p><p></p><p>Even for those who could cultivate it, reaching a high level was extremely difficult, much harder than cultivating martial arts, and not as rewarding as the auxiliary arts like healing or alchemy.</p><p></p><p>After scanning for nearly five minutes, Ye Xiao suddenly opened his eyes.</p><p></p><p>"I've found you."</p><p></p><p>The Divine Will Technique activated in an instant, and Ye Xiao's figure vanished from the spot, reappearing on a street.</p><p></p><p>Here, the cultivators and star beasts were engaged in a desperate battle.</p><p></p><p>When Ye Xiao appeared, some of the lower-level civilians under the protection of the cultivators were quickly fleeing outwards.</p><p></p><p>But there were still a few crazed star beasts that managed to break through the cultivators' defenses, frantically charging towards these civilians.</p><p></p><p>Many of the civilians only had Xiantian-level cultivation, some even below Xiantian-level. A single Xiantian 3rd or 4th rank beast could inflict devastating damage if it entered the crowd.</p><p></p><p>"Ah, don't kill me, don't kill me!"</p><p>"Someone, please save me, waaah!"</p><p></p><p>This was the first time Ye Xiao had witnessed star beasts slaughtering the human race.</p><p></p><p>Previously, the largest-scale incident he had seen was when the star beasts escaped from the research institute just as he was entering the Grandmaster realm.</p><p></p><p>Other than that, the star beasts had been eliminated by him before they could even harm the human race.</p><p></p><p>This life-and-death struggle between the two races, the sense of kill or be killed, deeply impressed upon Ye Xiao the importance of having great power to ensure safety.</p><p></p><p>Without hesitation, hundreds of sword beams formed behind Ye Xiao, shining with a golden light that made him appear like a true deity, mysterious and powerful.</p><p></p><p>The human cultivators on the street were deeply shaken, the sight forever etched in their minds.</p><p></p><p>In the next moment, the sword beams shot out, automatically seeking the star beasts.</p><p></p><p>Boom, boom, boom...</p><p></p><p>Each sword beam pierced and exploded a star beast instantly.</p><p></p><p>The hundreds of golden lightning-like sword beams, though created casually by Ye Xiao without using his true strength, contained power that was immeasurable.</p><p></p><p>Whether Xiantian 4th, 6th, 8th, or even 9th rank, they were instantly killed or destroyed upon contact, unable to survive Ye Xiao's sword beams.</p><p></p><p>[Author's note: This is the end of the second update, totaling 6,000 characters.

        <h1>Chapter 333</h1>
        <div class="content">
            <p>Here is the full English translation of the Chinese excerpt:</p><p></p><p>Watching the light summoned by the Heavenly Emperor flash and disappear in the starry sky, the three stood solemnly beneath the stars, gazing in the direction the Heavenly Emperor had departed.</p><p></p><p>Some people's deaths are as light as a feather, while others' deaths are as heavy as Mount Tai.</p><p></p><p>The Heavenly Emperor had sacrificed himself to create the opportunity to summon the Xuanyuan Clan, which was deeply moving and worthy of being remembered by all.</p><p></p><p>Unfortunately, he not only sacrificed his physical body, but also his soul. His entire imperial body had been completely destroyed.</p><p></p><p>So even if Ye Xiao wanted to use the divine-level healing art "Eternal Life Sutra" to save him, it would be impossible.</p><p></p><p>The Azure Dragon took a deep breath and sighed.</p><p></p><p>"Senior Heavenly Emperor, rest in peace."</p><p></p><p>After a moment of silence, the Sage Emperor spoke:</p><p></p><p>"We don't have time to mourn him now. The Star Beasts may return at any moment. They know how powerful Ye Xiao is, and if I'm not mistaken, they will likely concentrate their divine blood into one Star Beast to increase its strength in order to fight Ye Xiao. </p><p></p><p>They may even summon the ones behind the Star Beasts.</p><p></p><p>Furthermore, the Clan of the Gods is about to arrive. Even if the Star Beasts come, we must be prepared to deal with the Clan of the Gods."</p><p></p><p>The Azure Dragon pondered for a moment, then spoke:</p><p></p><p>"So what should we do next?"</p><p></p><p>The Sage Emperor looked at Ye Xiao and asked, "How many people know your identity in this world?"</p><p></p><p>Ye Xiao thought for a moment.</p><p></p><p>"Not many. Apart from my three private friends and my spirit pet, the only ones who know are the Four Elders, Sword God Li Liushui, Sword Saint Lu Qingshan, and the Ghost Fire Spiritual Eyes, North Hall Ce from the Central State.</p><p></p><p>I don't like to overly publicize myself, so there are few who know my identity."</p><p></p><p>"Excellent, at such a young age you already know how to conceal your edge. That is truly rare."</p><p></p><p>"However, the Silver Fox Clan of Silver Fox Valley does know my identity. But I can inform the Fox Queen to keep her clan members from exposing my identity."</p><p></p><p>"Silver Fox Valley? We don't need to worry too much about them.</p><p></p><p>The Silver Fox lineage had a connection with the Tyrant King of the human race long ago, so they are relatively reliable."</p><p></p><p>Pausing, the Sage Emperor continued:</p><p></p><p>"From now on, completely seal any news of Ye Xiao in the Nine States. At the very least, we cannot let anyone else know his identity.</p><p></p><p>The Clan of the Gods is about to arrive, and they are true masters of the martial dao. Destroy the networks of the Nine States, this will reduce a lot of information.</p><p></p><p>Although many people in this world already know of the existence of the Sword and Knife Immortals, as long as Ye Xiao's identity is not exposed, there won't be any major trouble in the short term.</p><p></p><p>The Xuanyuan Clan we summoned, while of the same lineage as us, we cannot guarantee they don't have other intentions.</p><p></p><p>At least until we can confirm 100% safety, Ye Xiao's identity must not be casually revealed.</p><p></p><p>If the Clan of the Gods truly arrives, we, the three Elders, along with other powerful experts of the Nine States, will form a high-level team to welcome them.</p><p></p><p>No one is to reveal Ye Xiao's identity. No matter what happens, he must not be allowed to act rashly."</p><p></p><p>The Azure Dragon nodded.</p><p></p><p>"I'll go down and arrange to erase all information related to Ye Xiao as much as possible."</p><p></p><p>"Good, go down first. And Ye Xiao, don't forget to release the human cultivators from the Imperial Seal Jade."</p><p></p><p>Ye Xiao couldn't help but speak up:</p><p></p><p>"Then what happens after that? Will the Imperial Seal Jade remain in my hands?"</p><p></p><p>The Sage Emperor nodded.</p><p></p><p>"Correct, the Imperial Seal Jade is the symbol of the Nine States, the treasure left behind by the ancestors of the human race. It is actually a spatial storage treasure that we used to transport cultivators in the starry sky.</p><p></p><p>Now that the starry sky battlefield is gone, it no longer holds much meaning for us.</p><p></p><p>Originally, this jade seal was passed from my hands to the Heavenly Emperor, and now the Heavenly Emperor has passed it on to you.</p><p></p><p>This is not only his belief in you, but also a sign that you are the next holder of the jade seal."</p><p></p><p>"Thank you."</p><p></p><p>Ye Xiao expressed his gratitude, and after a few more exchanges, the three descended to the ground.</p><p></p><p>Ye Xiao released the human cultivators from the Imperial Seal Jade, and before they could react, the Sage Emperor directly explained the situation to them, omitting Ye Xiao's identity as the Sword and Knife Immortal to prevent more people from knowing.</p><p></p><p>Meanwhile, in the starry sky, the various super divine Star Beasts had all fled back to their own territories. </p><p></p><p>Within the Star Beast domains, there was already a heated argument.</p><p></p><p>"Black Oblivion Beast! You beast! If it weren't for you, how could we have fallen into such a state? All the super divine Star Beasts were routed, you are the shame of our Star Beast clan!"</p><p></p><p>"Hmph, stop pretending to be so righteous. Heaven Sound Deer, you were the first to chase after me when I fled, weren't you? You also wanted to escape with me, don't try to act like the good guy here."</p><p></p><p>"You insolent wretch! I was chasing you, not trying to escape with you like you!"</p><p></p><p>"Enough, you're all just as bad as each other, the pot calling the kettle black."</p><p></p><p>Here is my translation of the Chinese excerpt:</p><p></p><p>Looking at the clamoring star beasts below, the figures surrounded in the middle were filled with rage and let out a furious roar.</p><p></p><p>They were the veteran super-divine star beasts of the starry sky, the elders of these new-type star beasts, and thus possessed great majesty.</p><p></p><p>A few figures swept their gaze around.</p><p></p><p>"This time, a super powerful expert suddenly appeared in the Nine States, which we did not anticipate. </p><p></p><p>But regardless of whose responsibility it is, we do not have the face to go back and see the Young Master.</p><p></p><p>I believe you all share my view - if we go see the Young Master like this, how many of us star beasts among us would survive?</p><p></p><p>You all know the Young Master's temper.</p><p></p><p>What the Young Master wants is also clear to everyone - the divine blood of the XuanYuan Clan of the Nine States!"</p><p></p><p>"So how does the Hawk God plan to deal with this?"</p><p></p><p>"Extract all the human divine blood from within your star beast bodies, and gather it into the body of one super-divine star beast, to forge a supreme expert. Let him go up against that powerful human expert from the Nine States."</p><p></p><p>"What?!"</p><p></p><p>"The divine blood we obtained with great difficulty? If we lose this divine blood, our cultivation will also drop back down to the half-step super-divine realm!"</p><p></p><p>"Yes! Why must we offer our own divine blood?"</p><p></p><p>The words had barely fallen when the one called the Hawk God raised his hand and directly grasped the neck of one of the super-divine star beasts.</p><p></p><p>The hawk claw exerted force, and with a crack, directly snapped the other's neck.</p><p></p><p>This scene immediately made all the star beasts shiver violently, and no one dared to say another word.</p><p></p><p>The gap between the rising super-divine and the veteran super-divine was not small at all. </p><p></p><p>The other could easily with a single hand severely injure or even kill them.</p><p></p><p>"I'll tell you the truth - if we can't get our hands on the divine blood of the descendants of the XuanYuan Clan of the Nine States, we won't survive when we go back to the Young Master.</p><p></p><p>To stay alive, we must subdue the Nine States. </p><p></p><p>And don't forget, the Wolf Emperor, Thunder Emperor, and Gold Ape Great Emperor of the human race have already successively completed the summons of their respective ancestral clans. If I'm not mistaken, the Scenery Emperor and Cloud Emperor have most likely also completed the summons.</p><p></p><p>If you all hesitate any further, by the time those clans arrive, even if we've already obtained the divine blood, we may still end up being left behind here."</p><p></p><p>Another tall and thin super-divine star beast spoke up calmly:</p><p></p><p>"The Hawk God is right. But I have one more point to add.</p><p></p><p>What the Young Master wants is only the divine blood of the human race of the XuanYuan Clan of the Nine States. If we can obtain the Xuanyuan divine blood, the Young Master may be so pleased that he won't take back the divine blood of the Wing Clan, Thunder Clan, and Gigantic Ape Clan in our possession, and may even give us some additional rewards.</p><p></p><p>Otherwise, even if we don't die upon returning, our divine blood will be stripped away.</p><p></p><p>You all are the same, unable to protect your own divine blood. </p><p></p><p>What to do? I don't need to say more, do I? This is our last stand, and no one has a choice."</p><p></p><p>The super-divine star beasts couldn't help but shudder violently.</p><p></p><p>Finally, one of the star beasts forcibly extracted the divine blood he had obtained from the tens of billions of descendants of the Western Wing Clan from his own body.</p><p></p><p>After extracting the divine blood from his body, his complexion immediately became pale and weak.</p><p></p><p>The next moment, his aura also began to rapidly decline. He had become a half-step super-divine, no longer a super-divine expert.</p><p></p><p>Gazing at the golden divine blood in his palm, his eyes revealed much reluctance.</p><p></p><p>But in the end, he still gritted his teeth and handed over his divine blood.</p><p></p><p>With one star beast taking the lead, the others immediately followed suit.</p><p></p><p>Soon, all the super-divine star beasts extracted their divine blood and handed it over to the eleven veteran super-divine ones.</p><p></p><p>At the same time, their cultivations all began to plummet madly, and in the blink of an eye, they had all fallen out of the super-divine realm and reverted to the half-step super-divine realm.</p><p></p><p>The eleven super-divine ones exchanged glances, the corners of their mouths slightly upturned, and the anger in their eyes finally dissipated somewhat.</p><p></p><p>"Who should be the one to handle this matter next? Although the divine blood is plentiful, scattered among all of us, it is far less effective than if concentrated in one person's body."</p><p></p><p>"Let me do it. I've always wanted to meet that human junior."</p><p></p><p>From among the eleven super-divine, a burly figure slowly stepped forward, wearing a bear fur coat, his muscular physique like that of an ox, exuding a visually explosive aura.</p><p></p><p>The killing intent revealed in his eyes was merciless, cold, bloodthirsty, and arrogant, making the surrounding star beasts shudder involuntarily.</p><p></p><p>Seeing him step forward, the other ten super-divine couldn't help but reveal an understanding smile.</p><p></p><p>"Good! You taking charge is most appropriate. You are ranked second on the Star Ranking, and the strongest combat power among us star beasts!</p><p></p><p>After absorbing this divine blood, your cultivation will be able to rise significantly again. Subduing the human race of the Nine States, you have the best chance!"</p>

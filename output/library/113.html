        <h1>Chapter 113</h1>
        <div class="content">
            <p>Here is the full English translation of the Chinese excerpt:</p><p></p><p>It seemed that due to safety concerns, the pedestrians on the street were walking with a bit of haste.</p><p></p><p>Among them was a figure, blending into the crowd, wearing a baseball cap and a trenchcoat. Although his build appeared a bit bulky, in the early autumn morning, he was not overly conspicuous.</p><p></p><p>A patrol vehicle from the garrison troops drove by, honking its siren, and he slightly lowered the brim of his cap.</p><p></p><p>As the patrol vehicle drove further away, a faint smile appeared on the corner of his mouth.</p><p></p><p>"The most dangerous place is often the safest place. </p><p></p><p>Now that I'm wearing a grandmaster-level protective armor and have concealed my aura, unless there is a cultivator at the grandmaster level or above, no one can detect me. </p><p></p><p>As long as I can escape from Jianghai City, I won't have to worry about anything."</p><p></p><p>As the words left his mouth, a handsome figure approached him, eating a steamed bun and drinking soy milk, with a small gray cat perched on his shoulder.</p><p></p><p>The other person did not look at him, but the little cat on his shoulder was staring straight at him.</p><p></p><p>This made his heart suddenly skip a beat.</p><p></p><p>Was he discovered? Discovered by a spirit beast?</p><p></p><p>No, the situation was not right. </p><p></p><p>The garrison troops also trained some spirit beasts to hunt down demonic beasts, beastmen, and spirit beasts, because spirit beasts are more sensitive to the auras of other spirit beasts.</p><p></p><p>These were organized garrison troop beast tamers.</p><p></p><p>The other person was not an ordinary person, but a garrison troop beast tamer! Hmph, did he think that by wearing casual black clothes, I wouldn't be on guard? And he's pretending to be eating just to deceive me, waiting until he's in front of me to suddenly strike, catching me off guard and subduing me? </p><p></p><p>Too bad, I've already discovered him.</p><p></p><p>Strike first, suffer later! Since I have grandmaster-level protective armor, there's no way this young person could be a grandmaster cultivator, he won't even be able to break through my defenses!</p><p></p><p>Eliminate him! His feet stepped down, his spiritual energy surging, his body instantly shooting forth like an arrow released from a bow, rapidly charging towards Ye Xiao.</p><p></p><p>Two breaths later, a violent explosion rang out, and the crowd immediately descended into panic.</p><p></p><p>"Oh no! There's been an explosion! People are dead!"</p><p></p><p>"Quick, take cover!"</p><p></p><p>The crowd was in an uproar, but Ye Xiao had already reached the entrance of the library.</p><p></p><p>His expression was filled with puzzlement.</p><p></p><p>What just happened?</p><p></p><p>Of course, he knew the other person's identity, Taixuan Tiangong had already scanned him, and the armor he was wearing was made from the hide of a wind tiger, so he was undoubtedly the fugitive.</p><p></p><p>But the question was, why did the other person attack him? The other person was only a post-celestial ninth-grade cultivator, there was no way he could have detected Ye Xiao's identity, and there were no garrison troops around, he had hidden himself well, there was no need to take a hostage and expose himself.</p><p></p><p>This problem left Ye Xiao utterly perplexed! After clocking in, he entered his management area to read books, glancing at the shoulder of his robe.</p><p></p><p>"Huanliuli, why are you just staring blankly ahead?"</p><p></p><p>He called out, but Huanliuli did not respond. He called again, and Huanliuli's pupils changed shape, finally stirring.</p><p></p><p>"Huh? I was sleeping."</p><p></p><p>Ye Xiao: "[]!"</p><p></p><p>"You can sleep with your eyes open?"</p><p></p><p>"Yeah, I've noticed that there's a creature on Earth called an owl, and I thought maybe we're distant relatives, since they can sleep with their eyes open, so I tried it too, and it actually worked!"</p><p></p><p>Ye Xiao: "(ï½€+)!"</p><p></p><p>He was at a loss for words.</p><p></p><p>Here is the full English translation of the Chinese excerpt:</p><p></p><p>This silly cat, it's always doing some silly and nonsensical things.</p><p></p><p>The owl is just a name with the word "cat" in it, but it's a bird! Forget it, I better focus on reading the book.</p><p></p><p>Ye Xiao once again immersed himself, searching for the foundational techniques for refining elixirs.</p><p></p><p>After a few days, Ye Xiao finally managed to gather the last two foundational techniques for elixir refinement.</p><p></p><p>On the divine book, all the pages recording the foundational techniques for refining elixirs were shining with a golden glow.</p><p></p><p>They can now be combined.</p><p></p><p>Coincidentally, it was another weekend, so Ye Xiao had enough time.</p><p></p><p>After returning home, he directly started to manipulate his divine soul to combine the techniques, then entered a dormant state, like a phone on standby mode.</p><p></p><p>The divine soul will be responsible for everything. After combining the techniques, it will continue to cultivate them, and by the next morning, the divine soul should have cultivated the techniques to the peak level, ready for Ye Xiao to use directly.</p><p></p><p>Soon, it was the next morning.</p><p></p><p>Ye Xiao woke up from his sleep, the quilt still piled up like a small mountain.</p><p></p><p>He didn't know how many years it could hold up before collapsing. Of course, he hoped it wouldn't collapse.</p><p></p><p>Although he didn't need to use it, it was still pleasing to the eye.</p><p></p><p>The divine book had successfully fused, revealing an emperor-level elixir refinement technique - "Myriad Elements Converge"!</p><p></p><p>Ye Xiao strongly suspected that his divine soul's cultural level was not very high, so the naming was always so mediocre.</p><p></p><p>The previous weapon forging technique was "Godly Craftsmanship", which was at least an idiom.</p><p></p><p>Now, it was just four simple words, not even an idiom.</p><p></p><p>This seriously did not match his youthful heart! Oh well, since it's an emperor-level technique, it's still very useful.</p><p></p><p>And he didn't need to shout it out dramatically, there's no need for that much embarrassment.</p><p></p><p>He put on his shorts and instantly used the divine will technique to teleport to the cellar.</p><p></p><p>The cellar was bitterly cold, with the array he bought online to condense the cold air, creating a function like a refrigerator to store some things.</p><p></p><p>The peeled black-scaled snake, under the erosion of the cold air, had already turned into a large, bright red sausage.</p><p></p><p>Ye Xiao waved his hand, sending several sword qi to cut the black-scaled snake into several segments.</p><p></p><p>An excellent elixir often uses high-end materials.</p><p></p><p>The nutrition must be rich, the blood qi must be vigorous, the meat must be fresh, and there must be no preservatives.</p><p></p><p>The black-scaled snake meets all these requirements.</p><p></p><p>After all, it's a primordial fourth-grade spirit beast.</p><p></p><p>Even though the outside skin is as black as charcoal, the meat inside is really tender.</p><p></p><p>Ye Xiao activated the technique, extracting all the blood qi and nutritional parts from the entire body of the black-scaled snake, including the meat, blood, bones, bone marrow, and tendons, refining them into a single elixir pill.</p><p></p><p>This elixir pill contained the equivalent of the full blood qi of an entire primordial fourth-grade spirit beast! Much better than the roasted black-scaled snake meat he had eaten before.</p><p></p><p>The elixir pill formed, ultimately becoming a golden pill the size of a peanut, spinning in front of Ye Xiao.</p><p></p><p>Ye Xiao quickly grabbed it and swallowed it.</p><p></p><p>"Crunch, crunch."</p><p></p><p>It had a faint fragrance, like roasted black-scaled snake meat, with a bit of fried chicken, crispy and with a nice chewing texture.</p><p></p><p>The taste was quite good.</p><p></p><p>This is the first update, please recommend.</p><p></p><p>(This chapter is complete)</p>

        <h1>Chapter 246</h1>
        <div class="content">
            <p>Here is the full English translation of the Chinese excerpt:</p><p></p><p>This change was quite peculiar.</p><p></p><p>If one were to say that at the Divine Monarch level, a martial artist would automatically develop a perceptive ability, allowing them to easily sense everything around them.</p><p></p><p>Then at the King Realm, one would be able to control everything around them.</p><p></p><p>One can only sense, while the other can do it with just a thought.</p><p></p><p>These are two completely different concepts.</p><p></p><p>Even a Divine Monarch can, after sensing, then exert their spiritual energy or mental power to act.</p><p></p><p>But for the King Realm, they can control these things simply through their own thoughts during the perception.</p><p></p><p>The step of executing a technique has been skipped.</p><p></p><p>Do not underestimate this step.</p><p></p><p>The decisive moment between experts is often in an instant.</p><p></p><p>The faster your speed, the higher your chances of winning.</p><p></p><p>Moreover, he may not even need to exert his own power, as those within a certain range around him would not dare to defy him, just by sensing his power.</p><p></p><p>For example, those Divine Monarch experts at the bottom of the Heavenly Demon Cliff before.</p><p></p><p>Their previous cultivation was only at the half-step King Realm, not truly entering that realm yet.</p><p></p><p>So after sensing his power, they still dared to flee.</p><p></p><p>If he had already reached his current cultivation at that time,</p><p></p><p>They may have had the thought to flee, but would absolutely not have the courage, let alone the action.</p><p></p><p>No wonder this realm is called the King Realm! With a single anger, Divine Monarchs fear, and all beings tremble.</p><p></p><p>What else could this be, if not a king? He had not even had the chance to fully experience his own formidable power yet.</p><p></p><p>Suddenly, Ye Xiao heard some shouts and sounds of battle in the distance.</p><p></p><p>He swept his gaze to the left and right, and a few cities dozens of miles away were being attacked by the Star Beasts. The martial artists were rising up to resist, engaged in fierce battles.</p><p></p><p>Those Star Beasts had all fled out because they were frightened by his breakthrough in the Heavenly Demon Cliff.</p><p></p><p>They were frantically invading the human cities, carrying out large-scale destruction, and many were even starting to eat people.</p><p></p><p>They had all fallen into a state of madness.</p><p></p><p>This sudden beast disaster was something the surrounding small cities could not withstand.</p><p></p><p>If it continued for ten more minutes, the human population in these small cities would suffer heavy losses, even facing the danger of annihilation.</p><p></p><p>To Ye Xiao, those Star Beasts under the Heavenly Demon Cliff were like mere ants.</p><p></p><p>But to the people in these cities, they were a huge, insurmountable disaster.</p><p></p><p>Ye Xiao let out a long sigh, and with a thought, suppressed the spiritual energy and activated the Plucking Star Hand.</p><p></p><p>Dozens of miles away, the Star Beasts were rampaging furiously in the cities.</p><p></p><p>Facing these small cities without high-level martial artists, they were like entering undefended territory, not needing to worry about human resistance at all.</p><p></p><p>The huge disparity in strength between the two sides further amplified their already frenzied nature.</p><p></p><p>Slaughter, devouring, and bloodshed had already completely taken control of their minds.</p><p></p><p>Desperate screams echoed through the cities, but to them, it was like sweet music.</p><p></p><p>But just as they were at the peak of their arrogance, suddenly, they found that their movements had slowed down.</p><p></p><p>Or rather, the entire city seemed to be gradually solidifying under a special force.</p><p></p><p>All living beings, even the scattered stones and droplets of water at that moment, were pitifully slow, almost motionless.</p><p></p><p>What was happening?</p><p></p><p>In this moment, both the Star Beasts and the humans were in a daze, somewhat at a loss.</p><p></p><p>However, the next second, suddenly, all the Star Beasts were frantically being pulled towards the sky by an invisible, massive force.</p><p></p><p>Whether they were ordinary Star Beasts, Sect Master Star Beasts, or even Grand Sect Star Beasts, none of them could escape the pull of this power.</p><p></p><p>They screamed in the air, constantly flailing their limbs, trying to escape, as if facing their doom.</p><p></p><p>But no matter how strong their power was, they could only resign themselves to being snatched away by this special energy.</p><p></p><p>In the blink of an eye, the hundreds of millions of Star Beasts that had invaded the human cities were quickly gathered in the sky, rapidly flying back towards the Heavenly Demon Cliff.</p><p></p><p>Millions of Star Beasts came from all directions, finally all converging around Ye Xiao.</p><p></p><p>Boom, boom, boom...</p><p></p><p>The moment they came before Ye Xiao, with just a thought, all the Star Beasts were killed, not a single one left.</p><p></p><p>At this moment, the sky had become a hell of Star Beasts, a sea of blood.</p><p></p><p>Countless Star Cores were floating amidst it.</p><p></p><p>Ye Xiao's mind turned, activating the Myriad Elements Converge, directly refining all the essence from the blood of the Star Beasts, and then devouring and refining all the energy from the Star Cores.</p><p></p><p>In less than two breaths, the sky that had been like a sea of blood was instantly cleared, and the blood and souls of the hundreds of millions of low-level Star Beasts had been refined into a single Immortal Elixir.</p><p></p><p>In the sky, there was a thundercloud that wanted to gather again, but Ye Xiao remained silent, completely ignoring it.</p><p></p><p>So, although it wanted to approach, it dared not to.</p><p></p><p>Here is the full English translation of the Chinese novel excerpt:</p><p></p><p>After becoming a King Realm cultivator, even Danlei had to show deference to Ye Xiao. What could it do? Even if it had formed, Ye Xiao could easily shatter it with just a thought.</p><p></p><p>The Heavenly Pill Dao did not dare to flee. Although it had awakened its spiritual intelligence and gained a glimmer of consciousness, it knew that the person before it was too powerful. It had no way to escape.</p><p></p><p>Ye Xiao's aura had completely enveloped it, and it could not muster any resistance at all. When Ye Xiao slightly raised his hand, the Heavenly Pill Dao, though unwilling, could not control its own body and obediently fell into Ye Xiao's hand.</p><p></p><p>Seeing the Heavenly Pill Dao fall into Ye Xiao's grasp, the gathered Calamity Pill Tribulation clouds in the distance eventually chose to disperse and give up.</p><p></p><p>It's better not to cause any trouble. This guy is explosively powerful, no longer an ordinary person. There's no benefit in provoking him, and you might even get beaten up.</p><p></p><p>Since it couldn't even show off, what was the point? Ye Xiao tossed the Heavenly Pill Dao into his mouth, and the pill instantly dissolved, transforming into a massive energy that surged through his viscera.</p><p></p><p>However, this time Ye Xiao did not need to activate any cultivation techniques, as his refined physique and spirit were already perfectly integrated and enhanced to the extreme. </p><p></p><p>Now that Ye Xiao had reached the King Realm, his soul and flesh had completely fused and strengthened to the utmost. Ordinary spiritual energy or soul power could no longer truly harm him. To attack him, one would need to combine spiritual energy and soul power for a dual strike.</p><p></p><p>Ye Xiao also noticed that his Indestructible Divine Body cultivation technique and his Undying Immortal cultivation technique were beginning to emit a faint golden glow. This meant that the two techniques could be considered a single supreme imperial art, but they still needed to be further integrated and refined.</p><p></p><p>Ye Xiao was not in a hurry. He had already accumulated three sets of techniques that could be combined - the healing arts of Stellar Incantation, Supplementing the Heavens, and Extreme Healing; the sword arts of Imperial Extreme Sword, Severing the Heavens, and Myriad Swords Converging; and the movement arts of Earth Escape, Divine Will Incantation, and Untraced Footsteps.</p><p></p><p>He was eager to try fusing these techniques. First, he used the three great healing arts to restore the people in the nearby cities who had been harmed by the star beasts, so their bodies would not be claimed by their loved ones.</p><p></p><p>After reaching the King Realm, Ye Xiao's power had grown tremendously, allowing him to easily heal the injured citizens in cities dozens of kilometers away. Though saved from the disaster, the expressions of the people were somber, as many had lost family and friends in the sudden calamity.</p><p></p><p>Amidst the grief, the supposedly dead bodies suddenly began to stir and sit up, much to the shock of those around them. Injured limbs and old wounds were miraculously healed. The people were amazed, witnessing what seemed like a divine miracle.</p><p></p><p>Once everyone had been fully restored, Ye Xiao ceased the healing arts and immersed himself in his Godly Tome, beginning to research the fusion of the imperial arts.</p>

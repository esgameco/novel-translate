        <h1>Chapter 100</h1>
        <div class="content">
            <p>Here is the full English translation of the Chinese excerpt:</p><p></p><p>Ye Xiao asked a question, and Boss Xu nodded.</p><p></p><p>This price was within Ye Xiao's expected range.</p><p></p><p>This was also the reason why he had never cared too much about money.</p><p></p><p>Because as long as one has the ability, it is too easy to obtain wealth.</p><p></p><p>For example, after learning the divine craftsmanship, Ye Xiao only spent a thousand yuan to buy pig iron and was able to forge a Grandmaster-level flying dagger worth 120,000 yuan.</p><p></p><p>If he used higher-grade materials, he could easily create weapons and armor worth hundreds of thousands or even millions of yuan.</p><p></p><p>This was simply a windfall profit! "Okay, then let's go with this price."</p><p></p><p>"Good! I'll transfer the money to you right away."</p><p></p><p>Boss Xu put away the flying dagger and continued, "Little Ye, there's something I want to discuss with you and get your opinion on."</p><p></p><p>"Go ahead."</p><p></p><p>"Recently, are you willing to forge more weapons?"</p><p></p><p>"Why?"</p><p></p><p>"The Seven Stars Convergence, you must have heard of it, right? On the day of the Seven Stars Convergence, the power of the star beasts will be strengthened, and the half-beasts will also go berserk.</p><p></p><p>So now, weapons are in high demand.</p><p></p><p>During this period, the prices of all kinds of weapons have risen quite a bit.</p><p></p><p>Like the Extraordinary-grade refined iron longsword you forged recently, the original retail price was only three or four thousand, but now it starts at five thousand.</p><p></p><p>If you're willing, just forge more weapons, and I'll buy them from you at a higher price. For each one, you can make at least two or three hundred more. The purchase price will be over three thousand.</p><p></p><p>You can forge one every night, and during the day, you can forge a few more. At least three a day.</p><p></p><p>You can earn a few thousand yuan a day, and in two or three months, you can buy a house and find a girlfriend. Isn't that great?"</p><p></p><p>Ye Xiao shook his head.</p><p></p><p>"Never mind, I'm not really interested."</p><p></p><p>"Don't be like that, think about it again. This is a rare opportunity, and as for the price, if you're not satisfied, we can negotiate further."</p><p></p><p>"It's not about the money, I'm not interested in money. I'm about to be late for work, I'll be going now."</p><p></p><p>After rejecting Boss Xu again, Ye Xiao turned and left.</p><p></p><p>Boss Xu shook his head behind him.</p><p></p><p>"What a pity, this kid has decent forging skills, but he's just too laid-back.</p><p></p><p>What's the use of having a handsome face if you have no money? He'll end up an old bachelor in the future."</p><p></p><p>With that, he went into the store to transfer the money to Ye Xiao.</p><p></p><p>At this time, Ye Xiao was already starting to ponder.</p><p></p><p>The prices of weapons have started to rise, which means the day of the Seven Stars Convergence must be approaching.</p><p></p><p>Currently, the entire Jianghai City has been swept clean by Elder Facheng, but that doesn't mean there won't be any star beasts.</p><p></p><p>Because after each beast disaster, the hidden star beasts will hide and develop, and they will also develop some forces.</p><p></p><p>Many of the half-beast organizations have more or less connections with them.</p><p></p><p>They may not be in the city of Jianghai, but they may be in the surrounding mountains and forests.</p><p></p><p>Once the day of the Seven Stars Convergence arrives, when their power is enhanced, they will be the first to attack the city.</p><p></p><p>Ye Xiao was not very concerned about these star beasts.</p><p></p><p>Trash is still trash, no matter how strong they become, they can never get out of the trash category.</p><p></p><p>Although Ye Xiao was more laid-back and easygoing, it didn't mean he was a fool.</p><p></p><p>He was not that concerned about those trash star beasts.</p><p></p><p>The only thing he cared about was Aier Wang.</p><p></p><p>Sovereign-level soul, Sovereign-level star core, Sovereign-level star beast meat, just thinking about it made his mouth water.</p><p></p><p>However, he was not sure if he could break through to the Sovereign realm before the arrival of the Seven Stars Convergence.</p><p></p><p>Perhaps he should consider forging some armor and weapons, so that he can better hunt Aier Wang when the time comes.</p><p></p><p>Here is the full English translation of the Chinese excerpt:</p><p></p><p>"Speaking of which, my current refinement level is too high. If I continue to do business with Old Xu in the future, I may be exposed and draw the attention of others.</p><p></p><p>Moreover, if I want to purchase some top-tier materials, it's also easy for others to trace back and expose my identity.</p><p></p><p>I've heard that every city has a black market where you can buy things.</p><p></p><p>Maybe I should disguise myself, change my identity, and go to the black market to take a look."</p><p></p><p>After arriving at the library, Ye Xiao quickly began to search for books on alchemy and started learning.</p><p></p><p>In one day, he found two different types of basic alchemy cultivation methods and absorbed them into the Golden Book of the Divine Consciousness to cultivate.</p><p></p><p>After work, he came to the black market of Jianghai City.</p><p></p><p>The black market is a place that is not under the control of the laws of the Nine Prefectures.</p><p></p><p>After all, when the employees of many mercenary companies hunt spirit beasts, they inevitably end up pocketing some of the spoils.</p><p></p><p>Some good things cannot be easily sold on the open market, but in the black market, they can fetch a good price.</p><p></p><p>And you can also avoid taxes.</p><p></p><p>Of course, the risks are also great.</p><p></p><p>First, there is the issue of trust between buyers and sellers.</p><p></p><p>Second, if the items being sold are too dangerous and exceed the standard, and you get caught by the garrison troops, that would not be a good thing.</p><p></p><p>In fact, the existence of the black market itself is not supposed to be, but its existence is justified.</p><p></p><p>There must be some people who want to have their cake and eat it too, otherwise, it wouldn't exist.</p><p></p><p>Overall, no matter what you do, you have to stay within the established rules. The rule is to be a good boy and not violate the rules of the Nine Prefectures, at least not blatantly.</p><p></p><p>Ye Xiao understood very well that whether you can be a good boy or not is not determined by whether you want to, but by whether you can.</p><p></p><p>If you are a super bigshot, even a hundred rules are just trash.</p><p></p><p>If you are a piece of trash, even one rule, you have to obey it.</p><p></p><p>He is not a piece of trash now, but only a Xiantian Fifth-Grade cultivator. He naturally won't do anything to break the rules, otherwise, he wouldn't have come to the black market, he would have just openly asked Old Xu to prepare those materials for him.</p><p></p><p>The location of the black market is in the northeast corner of the old town of Jianghai City.</p><p></p><p>It is usually open from 10 pm to 3 am.</p><p></p><p>When Ye Xiao arrived, the black market had just started.</p><p></p><p>He had used a disguise technique to change his face, so others wouldn't recognize his identity.</p><p></p><p>People fear being famous, and pigs fear being strong, so he had to take good precautions.</p><p></p><p>From afar, he could see that many people had already gathered at the black market.</p><p></p><p>In the dim street lights, people came and went, very lively.</p><p></p><p>The cries of the stall owners occasionally reached his ears.</p><p></p><p>This scene had a touch of the nostalgic feeling Ye Xiao had from his previous life, when he went to the village market with his parents as a child.</p><p></p><p>It was very warm and full of rustic charm.</p><p></p><p>After reminiscing for a few seconds, Ye Xiao put his hands in his pockets and walked into the street with the crowd.</p><p></p><p>The jade cat on his shoulder had also been specially treated, changing its color to look like an ordinary house cat.</p><p></p><p>"Master, what are we doing here? We'd be better off going home and taking a nap, this is so boring."</p><p></p><p>"Shut up, we're here today to do important business! You need to be on high alert."</p><p></p><p>The Illusory Jade's gaze suddenly sharpened. It seems that something big might happen tonight.</p><p></p><p>Just as the words fell, a melodious hawking voice suddenly reached their ears.</p><p></p><p>"Lean meat balls! A black market specialty, with a tender and smooth texture, come and try them!"</p><p></p><p>(This chapter ends)</p>

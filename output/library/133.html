        <h1>Chapter 133</h1>
        <div class="content">
            <p>Here is the full English translation of the Chinese excerpt:</p><p></p><p>"This, this is the legendary Imperial Art?" </p><p></p><p>After all, the crowd were all great masters, and to some extent, they had heard of the term "Imperial Art" before.</p><p></p><p>However, there were also a few who had never heard of it.</p><p></p><p>"What is the Imperial Art?"</p><p></p><p>The others immediately explained:</p><p></p><p>"It is rumored that above the grandmaster-level cultivation methods, there is an even more powerful cultivation method called the Imperial Art.</p><p></p><p>The power of the Imperial Art far surpasses the grandmaster-level cultivation methods. No matter how we cultivate the grandmaster-level cultivation methods, their peak values can only raise our cultivation to the pinnacle of the Xian Zong realm, the peak of the Shen Zong realm.</p><p></p><p>But the Imperial Art can allow one to break through beyond the Shen Zong realm.</p><p></p><p>Of course, this also depends on one's aptitude. If the aptitude is not good enough, one will definitely still be unable to break through.</p><p></p><p>However, even if one cannot break through beyond the Shen Zong realm, the level reached by cultivating the Imperial Art will be vastly different from cultivating ordinary cultivation methods.</p><p></p><p>Furthermore, if two people's martial dao cultivation realms are completely the same, but one of them cultivates the Imperial Art, even if the other has cultivated ten grandmaster-level cultivation methods, they will still be absolutely unable to defeat the one cultivating the Imperial Art."</p><p></p><p>"My goodness, there is actually such an overpowered cultivation method in this world? Then why have I never heard of it, nor encountered it before?"</p><p></p><p>That great master once again voiced his doubts.</p><p></p><p>The other masters could only bitterly smile.</p><p></p><p>"Don't just say you haven't seen it, we've only heard of it but have never seen it.</p><p></p><p>It is said that this kind of Imperial Art is only passed down and possessed by those extremely ancient families.</p><p></p><p>For others, they may not even hear about it their entire lives.</p><p></p><p>Today is the first time we've ever seen it."</p><p></p><p>"Sss!"</p><p></p><p>That great master was completely shocked.</p><p></p><p>And when he looked at Ye Xiao, he was even more shocked.</p><p></p><p>The powerful expert of Jianghai City in front of him actually possessed the Imperial Art, then how strong must he be?</p><p></p><p>Doesn't this mean that his future has a high possibility of breaking through the peak of the Shen Zong realm?</p><p></p><p>Ye Xiao paid no attention to the shock of the crowd, and only looked at Aier Wang calmly and said:</p><p></p><p>"This place is not suitable for a fight, let's change the location."</p><p></p><p>Here in the center of Jianghai City, with their cultivation, a battle would likely destroy the entire city of seven to eight million people, leaving no survivors, not even ashes that the Imperial Art-level healing arts could save.</p><p></p><p>Unfortunately, Aier Wang did not agree, only chuckling.</p><p></p><p>"Sorry, the one who can't unleash their full power here is only you."</p><p></p><p>With that, he stomped his foot, unleashing a mighty force that shattered the ground, opening up a hundred-meter-deep crevice rushing towards Ye Xiao.</p><p></p><p>Boom! In an instant, the crevice passed under Ye Xiao's feet, carving a massive chasm.</p><p></p><p>But Ye Xiao remained motionless, not even trying to counterattack against this force.</p><p></p><p>"Senior!" </p><p></p><p>The others couldn't help but exclaim in alarm.</p><p></p><p>But the next moment, Ye Xiao moved.</p><p></p><p>Without any further ado, he unleashed his mighty power, sweeping out a thousand-meter-long blade beam that viciously struck Aier Wang.</p><p></p><p>Boom! The power of this strike was so overwhelming that it was blinding.</p><p></p><p>It fell heavily upon Aier Wang, immediately triggering a massive explosion, kicking up clouds of dust and spreading shockwaves.</p><p></p><p>Everyone couldn't help but have their pupils constrict.</p><p></p><p>"Isn't this senior a swordsman? How can he use blade techniques? Isn't he a sword cultivator?"</p><p></p><p>"Could it be, could it be that the senior cultivates both sword and blade?"</p><p></p><p>"My goodness!"</p><p></p><p>An elderly female grandmaster immediately covered her mouth, afraid of screaming out loud.</p><p></p><p>To cultivate two martial arts simultaneously, and both to such a powerful degree! And on top of that, the earlier display of Imperial Art-level healing arts, just how many martial arts has this senior cultivated? But how does he resolve conflicts with so many cultivated arts? And why has he cultivated them all to such incredible levels?</p><p></p><p>"Haha haha, wonderful! Wonderful! This is true combat!" Aier Wang exclaimed excitedly from within the dust cloud, but the next moment, Ye Xiao leapt into the dust, delivering a kick to his chest.</p><p></p><p>Crack!</p><p></p><p>Even from outside the dust cloud, everyone could hear the crisp sound of bones breaking - this kick from the senior had injured Aier Wang.</p><p></p><p>So strong!</p><p></p><p>Everyone felt their skin crawling.</p><p></p><p>After that cracking sound, a golden light shot out from the dust cloud like a cannon shell, blasting towards the outskirts of Jianghai City. That was Aier Wang's body! He had been kicked away by Ye Xiao.</p><p></p><p>"Damn it, don't get so arrogant!" Aier Wang roared angrily, just about to stabilize himself and return to Jianghai City, when a dazzling thousand-meter sword beam suddenly slashed down from the dust, heavily striking Aier Wang and sending him plunging into the river outside Jianghai City, preventing him from re-entering the city.</p><p></p><p>"Good!" </p><p></p><p>The crowd couldn't help but cheer.</p><p></p><p>So powerful!</p><p></p><p>With just a few moves, the overwhelming strength Ye Xiao displayed had completely conquered their hearts, making these great masters instantly become his devoted followers.</p><p></p><p>No matter how strong a great master is, they are still not at the Shen Zong realm! Faced with Ye Xiao's crushing offensive power, they admired him from the bottom of their hearts.</p><p></p><p>"Don't come any closer," Ye Xiao said indifferently, and with a thought, he activated the Divine Intention Technique, instantly departing from Jianghai City.</p><p></p><p>Here is the full English translation of the Chinese excerpt:</p><p></p><p>After arriving outside the Jianghai City, the crowd exclaimed in surprise, "So fast!" They immediately rushed towards the outskirts of Jianghai City without hesitation.</p><p></p><p>Ye Xiao's words were simply ignored by them. There was no way they could do anything about it - this battle was too spectacular, beyond their wildest expectations. It might even be the most spectacular battle they would witness in their entire lives.</p><p></p><p>Even if they knew they might get injured by observing the battle, no one was willing to miss this extraordinary confrontation.</p><p></p><p>The moment Ye Xiao arrived on the river surface, the river was directly blasted open, reaching all the way to the riverbed, even exposing the fresh yellow mud underneath.</p><p></p><p>The body of the Aier King slowly rose from the riverbed. One of the huge horns on his head was broken, his face covered in fresh blood, looking particularly ferocious. But the broken horn was rapidly regenerating before their eyes - this was Aier King's innate supreme technique, a healing art no weaker than Ye Xiao's two imperial arts.</p><p></p><p>"Not bad, very not bad. The King has not been this excited in a long time. No wonder you were able to obtain the secret of the Silver Fox Clan - the Chenxing Technique. With this level of strength, among the innate seventh-grade Saint Sovereigns I've encountered in the human race, you can be considered the strongest of your peers!"</p><p></p><p>The moment he finished speaking, Ye Xiao struck down with his blade again. He had no intention of listening to Aier King's nonsense. This fellow was too arrogant. Rejecting him earlier had made him lose face, so Ye Xiao was determined to kill him.</p><p></p><p>Aier King's regeneration was extremely fast, so the only way to kill him was through relentless attacks - strike his body first, then extinguish his soul. Each time Ye Xiao severely injured his physical form, Aier King's power would weaken, and his regeneration speed would slow down. Once his physical endurance reached a critical point, the weakness of his soul would be exposed, allowing Ye Xiao to deliver the final blow to destroy his soul completely.</p><p></p><p>This strike caused Aier King to erupt in complete fury. Ye Xiao was completely ignoring him, which was a total disrespect.</p><p></p><p>"Damn it, get back!" Aier King unleashed a powerful punch just as Ye Xiao's blade descended.</p><p></p><p>The collision of their attacks triggered a violent explosion in the air, illuminating the entire river surface and a large part of Jianghai City. The shockwaves spread out like raging winds, forcing the nearby grand patriarchs who wanted to join the battle to hastily erect qi barriers to protect themselves from being swept away.</p><p></p><p>"So powerful! Is this the true battle between Saint Sovereigns?" </p><p></p><p>"No wonder the senior didn't let us get close. Even from this distance, the shockwaves are making it hard for us to advance. If we got closer, we'd probably get seriously injured!"</p><p></p><p>On the river surface, the explosion had not yet subsided when Ye Xiao suddenly pierced through the center of the blast, appearing in front of Aier King in an instant.</p><p></p><p>Aier King's pupils constricted, unable to believe his eyes. How could Ye Xiao break through their combined attack unscathed? That was simply impossible. When their attacks collided, the damage would be doubled. It was like two cars crashing head-on at 80 mph, even though their individual speeds were only 40 mph.</p><p></p><p>Even Aier King himself did not dare to directly charge through their attacks. But Ye Xiao had done it, and without a single scratch! This was not just the power of healing arts - not even the Chenxing Technique or the Supplementary Heavenly Art could repair a Saint Sovereign that quickly.</p><p></p><p>It had to be the armor! Aier King had just noticed the familiar aura on Ye Xiao's clothes. It was the snakeskin of the Black Scale Snake! Damn it, Ye Xiao had killed the Black Scale Snake!</p><p></p><p>But the Black Scale Snake's snakeskin should not be this strong and durable, even when forged into armor and infused with spiritual energy. This level of defensive power was undoubtedly that of an imperial weapon. How was this possible? How could the Black Scale Snake's snakeskin be forged into an imperial weapon? That was simply unbelievable, even with Ye Xiao's top-tier forging skills.</p><p></p><p>Before Aier King could figure it out, Ye Xiao had already approached him. Wielding the Tyrannical Blade, Ye Xiao unleashed a hundred blade beams that instantly sliced Aier King into a hundred pieces.</p><p></p><p>Without giving him a chance to regenerate, Ye Xiao followed up with the Heavenly Slash, a sword technique that shook the heavens, parting the clouds and deepening the river by dozens of meters.</p><p></p><p>Aier King's body was reduced to ashes under this devastating strike. But Ye Xiao did not let his guard down, for as long as Aier King's soul remained, he could still revive instantly.</p><p></p><p>Ye Xiao activated the Mysterious Heaven Qi Barrier, enveloping the area within a radius of tens of kilometers.</p>

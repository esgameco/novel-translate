        <h1>Chapter 244</h1>
        <div class="content">
            <p>Here is the full English translation of the Chinese excerpt:</p><p></p><p>In just ten seconds, eleven out of the twenty divine sovereign beings at the base of the Heavenly Demon Cliff were slaughtered.</p><p></p><p>Among them were even a few of the top-ranked divine sovereign star beasts of the Heavenly Demon Cliff.</p><p></p><p>What kind of terrifying power was required to accomplish this?</p><p></p><p>"Flee, flee!"</p><p></p><p>One of the divine sovereign star beasts finally could not endure the immense pressure in its heart, and with a shrill scream, transformed into a black flash of light and fled into the distance.</p><p></p><p>Seeing the one divine sovereign star beast flee, the other divine sovereign star beasts also abandoned their composure, as if finding an outlet, and all quickly fled in all directions, scattering like birds and beasts.</p><p></p><p>Faced with the fleeing of the star beasts, Ye Xiao was not flustered. </p><p></p><p>For him now, mere divine sovereigns could no longer escape from under his nose.</p><p></p><p>With a thought, the Plucking Star Hand activated, and the surging spiritual energy transformed into nine giant hands that instantly seized the nine divine sovereign star beasts that had fled, and pulled them back towards Ye Xiao.</p><p></p><p>"Noâ€”!"</p><p></p><p>The divine sovereign star beasts, who had just managed to flee far away, had just felt like they had escaped to the heavens. </p><p></p><p>But in the next moment, they were locked back by Ye Xiao's Plucking Star Hand, and were plunged into the utmost despair.</p><p></p><p>The most despairing thing in life is when you have just gained hope, only to have that hope shattered again in the blink of an eye.</p><p></p><p>When the nine star beasts were pulled back to Ye Xiao's side, the next moment, a golden circular halo lit up in the air.</p><p></p><p>Myriad Swords Converging!</p><p></p><p>Countless sword beams radiated out from that golden halo.</p><p></p><p>Boom boom boom, the sword beams fell like thunderous lightning, and with each impact, the ground shook violently.</p><p></p><p>The agonized cries of the divine sovereign star beasts, intertwined with the bombardment sounds, echoed and reverberated throughout the Heavenly Demon Cliff.</p><p></p><p>It was only at this moment that Kaso finally realized he was wrong, terribly wrong, to an absurd degree.</p><p></p><p>Where were these twenty divine sovereign star beasts? They were clearly just twenty dogs! No, even dogs were stronger than them, they were just twenty worms! He should have listened to Mingdie Immortal Sect and not come here.</p><p></p><p>If he hadn't come, he wouldn't have encountered this situation.</p><p></p><p>Alas, there is no regret medicine in this world! Only when the punishment falls upon oneself does one realize how important caution is.</p><p></p><p>Hearing this, countless star beasts no longer dared to remain in the Heavenly Demon Cliff, and fled outside in a rush, their speed like the waves of the vast sea.</p><p></p><p>In the darkness, one could clearly feel countless lives running and flying, shaking the earth, even causing the air to tremble.</p><p></p><p>The bombardment only lasted five seconds.</p><p></p><p>After five seconds, the nine star beasts had all perished.</p><p></p><p>And this was without Ye Xiao even exerting his full strength.</p><p></p><p>For him now, dealing with divine sovereigns no longer required him to go all out.</p><p></p><p>In the darkness, silence gradually returned, but the air was permeated with the stench of fresh blood.</p><p></p><p>The corpses of the divine sovereign star beasts continued to emanate heat.</p><p></p><p>After a long while of silence, a few early Sixth-Grade star beasts carefully approached.</p><p></p><p>Their intense curiosity drove them to come take a look, even though they knew this could lead them to a fate worse than death.</p><p></p><p>After all, this was a battle involving twenty divine sovereign star beasts!</p><p></p><p>At this moment, everyone wanted to know what had happened, and who had emerged victorious. They also wanted to know the fate of that human expert.</p><p></p><p>However, as the star beasts drew near, they were all stunned, petrified in their tracks.</p><p></p><p>Thud.</p><p></p><p>Even a great ancestor star beast directly knelt on the ground, his body limp, his expression one of utter disbelief.</p><p></p><p>What did they see? Corpses everywhere! The corpses of divine sovereign star beasts! And that human expert stood proudly in the center, not a single wound on him.</p><p></p><p>Heavens, was this the end of the world?</p><p></p><p>They simply could not believe their eyes.</p><p></p><p>Twenty divine sovereign star beasts, not just ordinary beasts, but super powerhouses capable of shaking a region. </p><p></p><p>United, they could even stir up a storm that would make the entire human race tremble.</p><p></p><p>Yet now, they had all fallen, fallen at the feet of a human expert.</p><p></p><p>They had not even been able to inflict the slightest harm on him.</p><p></p><p>Just how powerful was this human expert?</p><p></p><p>Ye Xiao swept a glance at the group of star beasts, and with just that one look, all the star beasts became completely frozen, not daring to move a muscle.</p><p></p><p>The impact Ye Xiao had brought them was simply too great. Now, faced with Ye Xiao, they could not even muster the will to resist.</p><p></p><p>At this moment, Ye Xiao suddenly spoke.</p><p></p><p>"Within one hour, I want to collect all the heavenly treasures and earthly resources at the base of the Heavenly Demon Cliff. If I don't see them, I will destroy the entire Heavenly Demon Cliff."</p><p></p><p>These tyrannical and completely unreasonable words caused the great ancestor star beasts to tremble inwardly. But the next moment, all the great ancestor star beasts frantically ran out.</p><p></p><p>They completely believed him.</p><p></p><p>Here is the full English translation of the Chinese excerpt:</p><p></p><p>This powerful human expert, if he could not find the heavenly treasures and earthly precious items for him, he probably would really destroy the entire Demon Cliff.</p><p></p><p>At that time, all of their star beasts would have to die.</p><p></p><p>So even though he is from the human race, they dared not resist him in the slightest.</p><p></p><p>Ye Xiao's strength has already surpassed their racial barriers.</p><p></p><p>So powerful that they had no choice but to obey Ye Xiao's orders.</p><p></p><p>After the major star beasts left, Ye Xiao tapped his foot and his figure instantly disappeared from the spot.</p><p></p><p>He had other matters to attend to.</p><p></p><p>As for the corpses of these divine ancestor star beasts, he did not need to take them, nor would any star beasts come to steal them.</p><p></p><p>Even if there were, he could instantly rush over.</p><p></p><p>In a bone mountain hundreds of miles away, a figure silently crawled out. She had completely concealed her entire aura, not daring to reveal even a trace of it.</p><p></p><p>The beautiful, pure white face revealed an expression of barely surviving.</p><p></p><p>"Fortunately, I did not listen to Kaso and did not go to attack that human expert. </p><p>If I had gone, I probably would have died by now."</p><p></p><p>She looked warily in that direction, swallowed a mouthful of saliva, and then immediately flew up into the sky.</p><p></p><p>However, just as she was about to soar into the sky, a golden palm print suddenly descended from the heavens, slamming her back down to the ground, unable to break free!</p><p></p><p>"I've found you."</p><p></p><p>Ye Xiao casually grabbed her with his large hand and brought her back to the place where the twenty divine ancestor star beasts had fallen, throwing her body among the other divine ancestor star beasts.</p><p></p><p>Since they were all comrades, they should die together, not a single one missing.</p><p></p><p>Looking at the twenty-one divine ancestor star beasts, Ye Xiao nodded in satisfaction.</p><p></p><p>With a full twenty-one divine ancestor star beasts, plus the heavenly treasures and earthly precious items beneath the Demon Cliff, he should be able to break through to the King Realm, right?</p><p></p><p>The flesh of these star beasts, due to the long-term corrosion of the killing aura, was no longer edible, but could be used to refine elixirs.</p><p></p><p>Otherwise, he could also consider bringing them to the breeding farm and harvesting their flesh daily, which would be a steady long-term supply.</p><p></p><p>Now it's not feasible, but it doesn't matter. Being able to directly advance to the King Realm is also a very good choice.</p><p></p><p>Before those major star beasts bring the heavenly treasures and earthly precious items, he can first scan the star cores of these star beasts to see if there are any suitable imperial arts.</p><p></p><p>Unfortunately, the bloodline power of most of these star beasts is not very strong, and there are only four or five with dragon-level bloodlines.</p><p></p><p>The vast majority of them were able to advance to divine ancestor star beasts solely due to the nourishment of the blood qi within the Demon Cliff.</p><p></p><p>So their bodies do not contain any particularly good cultivation methods.</p><p></p><p>Among those few dragon-level bloodline star beasts, Ye Xiao did find two imperial arts, but the others were not compatible with his current imperial arts.</p><p></p><p>One of the imperial arts is a movement technique.</p><p></p><p>It was extracted from the star core of the Eight-Legged Steed.</p><p>It is called the "Untraced by the Wind" technique.</p><p></p><p>His three movement techniques are the Earth Traversal Art, the Soaring Spiritual Incantation, and the Untraced by the Wind, which is more of an acceleration-type combat technique.</p><p></p><p>It can not only greatly increase his own speed in an instant, but also maintain it for a long time.</p><p></p><p>No wonder it is the technique of the Eight-Legged Steed, the eight-legged horse runs much faster.</p><p></p><p>The other technique is a fist art.</p><p></p><p>It was found in the star core of the Thunder Bison, called the "Galloping Thunder Immortal Fist".</p><p></p><p>This fist art is extremely domineering, empowered by thunderous force, able to instantly blast the opponent into a bloody mist.</p><p></p><p>It is definitely inferior to the Great Quiescence Fist, but overall it is still quite good. After all, it is an imperial art, and among the fist arts, it should be able to rank among the best.</p><p></p><p>Not too far behind.</p><p></p><p>The reason it just now failed to harm Ye Xiao was because the strength of the Thunder Bison was not enough, it could not reach the standard to injure Ye Xiao.</p><p></p><p>As always, the power of a technique depends entirely on the user's own condition. If the user is not strong enough, even the best technique will not work.</p><p></p><p>If the user is strong enough, even the weakest technique can unleash the most powerful attack!</p><p></p><p>Cultivation base is the most fundamental standard supporting attack power.</p><p></p><p>However, today's events have also made Ye Xiao more certain and convinced that relying on hunting star beasts to complete his collection of imperial arts is not very realistic.</p><p></p><p>There are not many divine ancestor star beasts, and the vast majority of them are not of dragon-level bloodline! They may have just lived too long, or had other fortuitous encounters, allowing them to cultivate into divine ancestor experts.</p><p></p><p>At this time, some major star beasts had gradually brought the heavenly treasures and earthly precious items to Ye Xiao.</p><p></p><p>"Senior, these are the heavenly treasures and earthly precious items you requested."</p><p></p><p>Ye Xiao's eyes flickered, he could now begin refining them.</p><p></p><p>A full twenty-one divine ancestor star beasts should be able to refine twenty-one immortal elixirs, which should be enough to help him break through to the legendary King Realm, right?</p><p></p><p>This is the first update, 3,000 words.</p><p></p><p>Please recommend, vote, and subscribe.</p><p></p><p>Thank you to book friends YBJXW, Ye Cheng Lang Tian Zi, Kuang Jue Fei Fu Jia, Xiao Yao Tian Xia, and Huang Hun Ban Xiao: Shi Yi for your donations, greatly appreciated!</p><p></p><p>(This chapter is complete)</p>

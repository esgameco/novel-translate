        <h1>Chapter 364</h1>
        <div class="content">
            <p>Here is the full English translation of the Chinese excerpt:</p><p></p><p>The two figures following behind saw Ye Xiao walk into the small alley. They exchanged a glance.</p><p></p><p>"This idiot actually delivered himself right to us."</p><p></p><p>They had been worrying, as there were people all around and it was not a good opportunity to make a move. But now Ye Xiao had walked right into the alley.</p><p></p><p>One of them sneered, "Let me go greet him and see if I can get some information out of him."</p><p></p><p>"Alright! But be quick about it, don't make too much commotion and attract the powerful experts of the XuanYuan Clan."</p><p></p><p>"Don't worry, he's just a minor character. It'll be easy pickings for me, like catching chickens and killing dogs. It's nothing noteworthy."</p><p></p><p>His companion didn't say much more. It was clear he agreed with the assessment.</p><p></p><p>He watched as the man followed Ye Xiao into the alley, while he himself waited alone on the street.</p><p></p><p>A few seconds later, he saw Ye Xiao emerge from the alley, unharmed. He was dumbfounded. </p><p></p><p>What was going on? Where was his companion? Why did Ye Xiao come out alone without being interrogated?</p><p></p><p>At that moment, Ye Xiao glanced at him.</p><p></p><p>In that single glance, he felt his spiritual power instantly spiral out of control.</p><p></p><p>Boom! In a flash, he was reduced to a mist of blood.</p><p></p><p>Even in the moment of his death, he could hardly believe it. </p><p></p><p>He must have encountered a ghost. Otherwise, how could he have been instantly killed like that?</p><p></p><p>This thought only lasted half a second, because half a second later, his soul was also reduced to shreds by Ye Xiao's Demon Eyes.</p><p></p><p>Any enemy who had seen Ye Xiao in action and laid eyes on his face would have to die! Although it had only been a few seconds, Ye Xiao had completely grasped the reason for their presence.</p><p></p><p>The good news was, they still didn't know about the existence of the Divine King's Tomb.</p><p></p><p>However, the recent commotion of the XuanYuan Clan had caused some vigilance in the Western Three Tribes, so they had sent spies to investigate the situation in the Lower Nine Heavens.</p><p></p><p>They had not only placed spies here, but also inserted informants in other places.</p><p></p><p>Unfortunately, while scanning the opponent's spiritual power, Ye Xiao had also obtained their list of names.</p><p></p><p>The rest was simple. Ye Xiao directly edited a few messages and transmitted them to Beitang Ce using a Thought Stone.</p><p></p><p>Let Beitang Ce and his people take care of these guys. After all, they were spies from the other three clans, so they couldn't be left alive.</p><p></p><p>After receiving the message, Beitang Ce immediately responded to Ye Xiao and began taking action. Under Ye Xiao's name, he arranged for people to search for the spies, so Ye Xiao's identity wouldn't be exposed.</p><p></p><p>Afterwards, Ye Xiao continued to go to the library to read books.</p><p></p><p>However, in less than half an hour, a message came from Emperor Jing's Thought Stone.</p><p></p><p>It only had three words: "Trouble has occurred."</p><p></p><p>Ye Xiao's eyes narrowed, and he immediately connected with Emperor Jing.</p><p></p><p>"What happened?"</p><p></p><p>Emperor Jing's tone was somewhat heavy.</p><p></p><p>"Beitang Ce has been seriously injured, his eyes gouged out."</p><p></p><p>Ye Xiao's pupils constricted, and a cold murderous intent instantly surged in his heart.</p><p></p><p>"Why did this happen? Didn't he go after the spies with people from the XuanYuan Clan?"</p><p></p><p>"That's not the case. He went with people from the XuanYuan Clan. But as you know, most of the XuanYuan Clan's experts are currently in the Starry Sky. The defense force on the ground is very weak.</p><p></p><p>The opponent was an Empyrean Realm 27 Dragon expert.</p><p></p><p>The Xuanyuan Clan also lost two Empyrean Realm experts, and the opponent has already fled back to the Starry Sky. If my guess is correct, he should have already escaped by now."</p><p></p><p>Ye Xiao clenched his fists, the bones cracking, and the murderous intent in his eyes solidified.</p><p></p><p>He had been careless.</p><p></p><p>He hadn't expected that the Xuanyuan Clan had actually withdrawn the majority of their powerful experts to the Starry Sky, weakening the ground defense.</p><p></p><p>It couldn't be entirely blamed on him, though. The intelligence he had obtained indicated that the opponents were only at the early Empyrean Realm, not an Empyrean Realm 27 Dragon expert.</p><p></p><p>It seems that among the three clans, they were also harboring malicious intentions towards each other, even deceiving the spies they sent about their true strength.</p><p></p><p>So the information he obtained by scanning their spiritual power was inaccurate.</p><p></p><p>"Take good care of Senior Beitang."</p><p></p><p>"Ye Xiao, don't be rash. I'll immediately notify the Xuanuan Clan. They have high-level experts, Saint Realm experts, who can definitely handle this. You absolutely must not go there yourself. If anything happens to you, that would be a true massive loss for us.</p><p></p><p>Besides, the spies weren't sent by you, so you don't need to take it too much to heart."</p><p></p><p>Ye Xiao coldly said, "Even though the spies weren't sent by me, I was the one who notified Senior Beitang. If I hadn't informed him, he wouldn't have encountered this.</p><p></p><p>Moreover, the Demon Fire Spirit Eyes are a supreme treasure. </p><p></p><p>When they were in Senior Beitang's possession, the Xuanuan Clan might not have dared to make a move.</p><p></p><p>But now that they've been taken, if the Xuanuan Clan seizes them back, they may very well keep them for themselves.</p><p></p><p>When you notify the Xuanuan Clan, don't mention that Senior Beitang's eyes have been taken.</p><p></p><p>Let me see if I have a chance to retrieve them."</p><p></p><p>Here is my translation of the Chinese excerpt you provided:</p><p></p><p>"Do you have confidence? Among the experts sent by the three tribes of the Thunder God Clan, I've heard that there are over a hundred Emperor Realm cultivators, and not just one. Even if your strength is a little higher than theirs, with so many of them working together against you, you may not necessarily have a chance to win. You must not be careless."</p><p></p><p>"Don't worry, I have it figured out."</p><p></p><p>Ye Xiao hung up the communication with the spiritual stone and stored it back into his spatial ring.</p><p></p><p>The next moment, he directly activated the Yin-Yang Escape Technique and instantly arrived in the starry sky.</p><p></p><p>After reaching the Divine Realm, his speed had reached an immeasurable level.</p><p></p><p>Arriving in the starry sky, he closed his eyes and directly expanded his consciousness outward. </p><p></p><p>This incredibly powerful mental fluctuation spread out across the entire starry sky, expanding further and further, reaching tens of thousands of kilometers away in the blink of an eye. A few seconds later, Ye Xiao suddenly opened his eyes, and a cold, bloodthirsty light burst forth.</p><p></p><p>"I've found you."</p><p></p><p>With those words, he vanished from the spot.</p><p></p><p>On the other side, in the temporary command center set up by the three tribes under the starry sky, a blood-soaked figure of the Emperor Realm strode into the command center.</p><p></p><p>"Maige Lei, why are you covered in blood?"</p><p></p><p>The leading figures of the three divine tribes couldn't help but ask, puzzled by the sight.</p><p></p><p>Maige Lei panted heavily and coldly said, "Damn it! We've run into trouble. I don't know who leaked our information, but everyone was wiped out. </p><p></p><p>Luckily, I hid part of my strength and ran fast. </p><p></p><p>Otherwise, you all wouldn't even be seeing me right now."</p><p></p><p>"Then... did you find out any information?"</p><p></p><p>"What information? I'm lucky to have made it back alive."</p><p></p><p>Katuo Meier's face turned cold. "You didn't expose your identity, did you? Or did anyone follow you?"</p><p></p><p>"Of course not, I still have some brains left."</p><p></p><p>Katuo Meier nodded.</p><p></p><p>"Since no one followed you, that's for the best. That way, if the Xuanyuan Clan asks, we can say they were the ones who defected, and distance ourselves from this."</p><p></p><p>"Good idea, Captain Katuo Meier really is skilled at public relations."</p><p></p><p>Katuo Meier snorted coldly.</p><p></p><p>"This is no time to be happy. Why were our people discovered? The Emperor Realm experts we sent out this time were all powerful, and even their peers wouldn't easily spot their weaknesses. </p><p></p><p>It seems the Xuanyuan Clan's foundation is far beyond our expectations.</p><p></p><p>From now on, we can only wait until our true experts from the three tribes arrive, and then settle the score with the Xuanyuan Clan."</p><p></p><p>As soon as he finished speaking, a violent explosion suddenly came from outside.</p><p></p><p>Boom! This earth-shattering roar immediately startled the others.</p><p></p><p>"What's going on?"</p><p></p><p>Before the words had even fallen, a figure rushed in to report at top speed, "Report! Report! Esteemed commanders, we're in big trouble.</p><p></p><p>A powerful expert from the Xuanyuan Clan has broken through outside."</p><p></p><p>"What?"</p><p></p><p>The group exchanged glances, their expressions changing, and immediately strode out.</p><p></p><p>"Quickly, go take a look."</p><p></p><p>When they arrived outside, they couldn't help but be shocked, their pupils constricting.</p><p></p><p>Under the starry sky, an extremely handsome figure from the Xuanyuan Clan was stepping on the stars as if walking on flat ground, approaching them step by step.</p><p></p><p>He had his hands clasped behind his back, his expression calm, without even moving his arms.</p><p></p><p>But with each step he took, several, or even over a dozen members of the three divine tribes were exploded.</p><p></p><p>Those tribe members were detonated as if by a force completely beyond this dimension, without the slightest resistance.</p><p></p><p>This power was even completely invisible, and they couldn't understand how he was attacking.</p><p></p><p>But now was not the time to ponder this.</p><p></p><p>Because Ye Xiao had killed their tribe members, that was enough.</p><p></p><p>"Wait, sir, please wait a moment."</p><p></p><p>Maikang immediately went in front of that figure and cupped his hands, saying, "Our three tribes and the Xuanyuan Clan have no conflicts. Why are you doing this? Why are you indiscriminately killing my three tribe disciples?"</p><p></p><p>That figure, naturally, was none other than Ye Xiao.</p><p></p><p>Ye Xiao merely glanced at him, not even responding a single word.</p><p></p><p>Activating his Elemental Eyes, a huge murderous aura directly assaulted Maikang's face.</p><p></p><p>So powerful!</p><p></p><p>Feeling the overwhelming power, Maikang's face instantly turned deathly pale.</p><p></p><p>He swore that he had never encountered such powerful force, even from the Divine Realm experts he had seen before.</p><p></p><p>In less than a second, from the moment he saw the look in Ye Xiao's eyes, he was directly blasted into a bloody mist.</p><p></p><p>To deal with enemies, there is no mercy! This was Ye Xiao's belief.</p>

        <h1>Chapter 24</h1>
        <div class="content">
            <p>Here is the full English translation of the Chinese excerpt:</p><p></p><p>Qin Yuyan murmured a sentence, and the confusion in her eyes gradually turned into clarity.</p><p></p><p>She took a deep breath and put down the illusory glass.</p><p></p><p>"Mr. Ye, thank you, I have the answer now."</p><p></p><p>Ye Xiao nodded and continued reading his book, while Qin Yuyan turned and left.</p><p></p><p>The next two days passed in a flash.</p><p></p><p>In these short two days, the hottest topic in the entire Jianghai City was the challenge between the sword art genius from Hanzhou, Park Jian-sheng, and Qin Yuyan, the daughter of the Qin family, the most powerful martial arts lineage in Jianghai City.</p><p></p><p>Everyone was well aware of Park Jian-sheng's formidability. Although they disliked people from Hanzhou, they had to admit that Park Jian-sheng, through his own efforts, had defeated the top sword art geniuses from the capital, proving his exceptional skills.</p><p></p><p>As for Qin Yuyan's abilities, the public was unsure how to evaluate them. The Qin family was the strongest martial arts lineage in Jianghai City, and they had the backing of the contemporary grandmaster Qin Sheng-long. Qin Yuyan's sword art level was undoubtedly outstanding.</p><p></p><p>However, the problem was that Jianghai City was far inferior to the capital in terms of martial arts talents. If the geniuses from the capital had all been defeated by Park Jian-sheng, could Qin Yuyan really stand a chance?</p><p></p><p>Finally, on the third day of the heated discussions, the much-anticipated battle took place in the martial arts hall of the Jianghai City Martial Arts Academy. In the rest area outside the hall, Qin Sheng-long was intently watching his most prized granddaughter.</p><p></p><p>"Yuyan, keep your mind calm and composed. As long as you can withstand one more move, it will be a victory!"</p><p></p><p>Qin Sheng-long was not a fool; he naturally knew that his granddaughter could not be Park Jian-sheng's match. Just like the Qin family's sword techniques could not surpass the prestigious sword arts of the capital. However, the longer Yuyan could persist, the more she could showcase the level of the Qin family's sword techniques and her own talent.</p><p></p><p>Qin Yuyan took a deep breath, her eyes filled with determination.</p><p></p><p>"Grandfather, I have been following your teachings for twenty-one years. During these twenty-one years, I have always obeyed the ancestral rules of the Qin family without the slightest deviation.</p><p></p><p>But this battle is about the honor of the Nine Realms, and it also concerns the future path of my martial arts. This time, no matter what I do, I hope you can understand and support me."</p><p></p><p>Qin Sheng-long was taken aback, looking at Qin Yuyan with confusion and bewilderment.</p><p></p><p>"Yuyan, what do you mean?"</p><p></p><p>Qin Yuyan walked past her grandfather and headed towards the martial arts hall.</p><p></p><p>"I want to win this battle."</p><p></p><p>Qin Sheng-long's body suddenly trembled, and his brows furrowed deeply.</p><p></p><p>"Is this girl running a fever?"</p><p></p><p>Shaking his head, he followed her into the hall.</p><p></p><p>In the martial arts hall, Park Jian-sheng was already standing on the stage, with many female students cheering for him loudly. However, Park Jian-sheng remained calm, his eyes closed, as if the commotion around him was irrelevant.</p><p></p><p>It was not until a voice was heard that he suddenly opened his eyes.</p><p></p><p>"Senior Qin is here!"</p><p></p><p>Some male students also started cheering, trying to counter the mindless female fans.</p><p></p><p>"Senior Qin, I love you!"</p><p>"Senior Qin, defeat that arrogant Korean!"</p><p></p><p>Park Jian-sheng opened his eyes, and a flash of admiration crossed his gaze, but it quickly returned to his calm demeanor.</p><p></p><p>True martial artists are usually not too interested in matters outside of the martial arts. Even though Qin Yuyan was indeed of unparalleled beauty, it was far less meaningful to him than improving his own abilities.</p><p></p><p>Qin Sheng-long also walked up to the spectator stands and sat down next to Professor Du Changfeng.</p><p></p><p>"How is Yuyan's mental state?"</p><p></p><p>Here is the full English translation of the Chinese excerpt:</p><p></p><p>"Huh?" Dou Changfeng asked.</p><p></p><p>Qin Shenglong raised his eyebrows slightly.</p><p></p><p>"I'm not too sure. I feel like she's been a bit strange today."</p><p></p><p>"Strange?"</p><p></p><p>Dou Changfeng looked at Qin Yuyan on the field, feeling a bit puzzled.</p><p></p><p>"The determination in this child's eyes is so strong!"</p><p></p><p>"I'm not too sure either. She actually said she wants to defeat Pao Jiansheng. Do you think she's been stimulated by something?"</p><p></p><p>Dou Changfeng's pupils constricted.</p><p></p><p>"This child has some ideas."</p><p></p><p>The battle on the field soon began, and the Korean team captain, speaking fluent Chinese, said:</p><p></p><p>"In this match, the cultivation levels of both sides must be restricted to below the Fifth Rank. </p><p></p><p>The weapons will be standardized as unsheathed iron swords.</p><p></p><p>If any rules are violated, the violator will automatically lose.</p><p></p><p>And if it causes casualties, the violator will bear all the consequences.</p><p></p><p>If there are no objections, let the match begin!"</p><p></p><p>Pao Jiansheng slowly lowered his hands from behind his back, and the school staff presented two iron swords to the two contestants.</p><p></p><p>Just as Pao Jiansheng was about to take the sword, Qin Yuyan suddenly spoke up:</p><p></p><p>"Wait!"</p><p></p><p>The people present couldn't help but furrow their brows, not understanding.</p><p></p><p>Pao Jiansheng also paused.</p><p></p><p>The next moment, Qin Yuyan spoke again:</p><p></p><p>"In a sword duel, I'm no match for you, so this match is meaningless. Therefore, I concede!"</p><p></p><p>These words caused an uproar in the audience, especially Qin Shenglong.</p><p></p><p>"Has she gone mad? What is she doing?"</p><p></p><p>But Dou Changfeng felt something unusual and held Qin Shenglong back.</p><p></p><p>"Old Qin, don't be impulsive, let's see what happens."</p><p></p><p>Amidst the discussions, Qin Yuyan said word by word:</p><p></p><p>"But! I want to challenge you with my other martial art!"</p><p></p><p>Pao Jiansheng's eyes flickered.</p><p></p><p>"What martial art?"</p><p></p><p>"Dao!" </p><p></p><p>This single word "Dao" once again caused an uproar.</p><p></p><p>"Isn't the Qin family known for their swordsmanship? How can she use a Dao?"</p><p></p><p>"What the hell is she doing?"</p><p></p><p>Qin Shenglong directly slammed the table, more agitated than when Qin Yuyan had conceded.</p><p></p><p>"This damned girl, is she trying to ruin the reputation of the Qin family? She actually cultivated the Dao art!"</p><p></p><p>But Dou Changfeng still firmly held him back.</p><p></p><p>"Old Qin, let's just watch and see."</p><p></p><p>His eyes had a hint of excitement, as if he had already thought of something.</p><p></p><p>On the field, the Korean captain immediately objected.</p><p></p><p>"No, we're here to challenge the Jiuzhou sword art, we don't accept Dao art!"</p><p></p><p>They weren't fools, after all, Jiuzhou had a vast territory and abundant talents. </p><p></p><p>If they competed in swordsmanship, they could reduce the number of Jiuzhou's geniuses.</p><p></p><p>Otherwise, if those who practiced Dao, gun, and fist arts all came up, wouldn't that greatly increase Pao Jiansheng's chance of losing?</p><p></p><p>But Pao Jiansheng looked at Qin Yuyan with great interest.</p><p></p><p>"The Qin family specializes in swordsmanship, your Dao is something you learned secretly?"</p><p></p><p>Qin Yuyan nodded.</p><p></p><p>"How long have you been cultivating it?"</p><p></p><p>"Less than two months!"</p><p></p><p>The audience erupted in an uproar again.</p><p></p><p>"This girl has really gone mad!"</p><p></p><p>"Senior Sister Qin, what the hell is she doing? Has she gone stupid? She's abandoning the sword art she's cultivated for decades and using a Dao she's only practiced for two months!"</p><p></p><p>Amidst the doubts of the crowd, Pao Jiansheng stared intently at Qin Yuyan, seeing the determination in her eyes, and finally nodded.</p><p></p><p>"Okay!"</p><p></p><p>(End of this chapter)</p>

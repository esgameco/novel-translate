        <div class="content">
            <p>Here is the full English translation of the Chinese excerpt:</p><p></p><p>As they were speaking, a purple celestial thunder suddenly crashed down from the horizon.</p><p></p><p>Rumble—! The massive thunderous roar made the hearts of everyone present tremble violently for a moment, as if they had been gripped by someone.</p><p></p><p>The wind gradually grew stronger, and the purple clouds in the distance began to surge towards them. The surrounding clouds also started to slowly descend, as if in awe of some terrifying presence.</p><p></p><p>What was even more eerie was that countless flowers and plants around them began to bow towards the ruins of the Imperial Realm, assuming an extremely reverential posture.</p><p></p><p>Ning Yuhen and the Vixen Queen exchanged a glance, their eyes filled with excitement and deep shock. They had already vaguely guessed what had happened - Ye Xiao had broken through!</p><p></p><p>Ye Xiao had broken through to the Imperial Realm!</p><p></p><p>The other spirit beasts did not know what was happening, but looking at the sky, they also felt uneasy.</p><p></p><p>"Such a powerful celestial phenomenon, the purple qi coming from the east, what does this mean?"</p><p></p><p>"I'm not too sure, but I think I heard from an elder that the purple qi coming from the east is a symbol of a certain cultivation breakthrough for the human race, but I've forgotten the specifics."</p><p></p><p>Rumble—! At this moment, another purple celestial thunder crashed down, causing the spirit beasts to instantly narrow their pupils.</p><p></p><p>Beneath where the thunder fell, several half-Demigod Realm experts were instantly annihilated, reduced to ashes without a trace. </p><p></p><p>Qing Niao Yuweiji couldn't help but swallow hard, cautiously saying, "Brothers, I feel like something's not quite right here. Should we leave?"</p><p></p><p>Bai Yao Xingguang glanced at him coldly and said, "Leave? You want to leave behind the legacy of a human Imperial Realm expert?"</p><p></p><p>"But this scene, I can't help but feel something's off."</p><p></p><p>"Idiot, when an Imperial Realm legacy is activated, there will naturally be celestial phenomena. How can you not know such basic knowledge?"</p><p></p><p>As they spoke, the doors of the Imperial Realm ruins suddenly opened again.</p><p></p><p>Rumble, rumble, rumble, all the spirit beasts shifted their gaze towards it, staring intently.</p><p></p><p>"It's open! The Imperial Realm ruins have opened!"</p><p></p><p>As soon as it opened, the spirit beasts saw the place was filled with all kinds of heavenly treasures and earthly resources.</p><p></p><p>In an instant, the spirit beasts couldn't help but swallow hard again.</p><p></p><p>"Such a huge blood spirit mushroom! That blood spirit mushroom must be at least a few thousand years old."</p><p></p><p>"Not just that! The spiritual energy in this Imperial Realm ruin is so dense, it must have absorbed an unimaginable amount of spiritual energy over the years, equivalent to decades outside. It's at least eight or nine thousand years old, almost a thousand-year-old spirit mushroom."</p><p></p><p>The spirit beasts were extremely eager, wanting to rush in and seize the heavenly treasures and earthly resources. But the next moment, another purple celestial thunder crashed down.</p><p></p><p>Followed by the second, third, and fourth, the spirit beasts were forced to retreat, unable to approach.</p><p></p><p>But every spirit beast stared fixatedly at the interior, their eyes filled with greed.</p><p></p><p>They all wanted to wait for the purple celestial thunder to disappear, so they could be the first to enter and plunder the treasures, even the Wolf God Sculpture Wolf who had just suffered heavy injuries was secretly repairing his body.</p><p></p><p>They had completely forgotten about the Silver Fox Clan, now all the spirit beasts' thoughts were focused on the Imperial Realm legacy.</p><p></p><p>Ning Yuhen and the Vixen Queen were also staring intently at the ruins, but they were different from the other spirit beasts. They only hoped that Ye Xiao could withstand this thunder tribulation.</p><p></p><p>These purple celestial thunders were all falling into the ruins, striking Ye Xiao.</p><p></p><p>The soul of King Zhou immediately spoke up:</p><p></p><p>"Young man, don't resist, fully utilize these thunders to temper the divine blood within you, make your divine blood even more vigorous, and then take that final step."</p><p></p><p>Ye Xiao calmed his mind and allowed the purple celestial thunders to strike his body, helping him step-by-step refine that final divine blood, completely removing the part containing King Zhou's consciousness.</p><p></p><p>In its place was divine blood without any consciousness, which was then occupied by his spiritual power.</p><p></p><p>In this way, his physical body was constantly strengthened under the endless bestowal.</p><p></p><p>Although he was only at the peak of the King Realm, half-step into the Imperial Realm, his physical body had already surpassed the strength of the Imperial Realm.</p><p></p><p>The purple celestial thunders fell densely like countless dragons biting into Ye Xiao's body, the immense pain far exceeding the imagination of an ordinary person.</p><p></p><p>For other half-step Imperial Realm experts, they would likely be instantly annihilated by these purple celestial thunders. But Ye Xiao would not, and the pain he felt was hundreds, thousands, even tens of thousands of times greater than a normal person.</p><p></p><p>In this pain, the divine blood containing King Zhou's consciousness became less and less, until the very last drop was completely consumed by Ye Xiao.</p><p></p><p>Now, Ye Xiao's body was filled with only the rich divine blood.</p><p></p><p>Although he had previously activated all the divine blood in his body, his divine blood was not abundant, as the human legacy had been diluted too much over the generations.</p><p></p><p>This was also why on Earth there were...</p><p></p><p>Here is the full English translation of the Chinese excerpt:</p><p></p><p>Many of the human race have lost the ability to awaken their divine souls.</p><p></p><p>The reason for this is that the divine blood within the bodies of many humans has almost dried up and disappeared.</p><p></p><p>It is only when one elevates their cultivation that the divine blood will be reactivated and begin to gradually produce more divine blood.</p><p></p><p>After Ye Xiao had completely refined all of the divine blood of the Tyrant King, his own innate talent received an enormous boost, reaching a brand-new realm.</p><p></p><p>It was at this moment that he no longer needed to suppress the power within him and directly chose to break through.</p><p></p><p>He had been waiting for a long time, and now this moment had finally arrived.</p><p></p><p>Boom! Accompanied by a surge of spiritual energy within Ye Xiao's body, he completely stepped into the realm of Emperor Cultivation that he had long dreamed of! His rich and potent vital energy was boiling, and Ye Xiao felt that at this moment, he was capable of anything!</p><p></p><p>At this moment, he discovered that his power could now form a domain.</p><p></p><p>Even when he was at the King Realm, he had this feeling - he could complete certain thoughts and requirements within his own mind's impulse.</p><p></p><p>At the Divine Ancestor Realm, he used mental intent to drive spiritual energy, and at the King Realm, he skipped the step of driving spiritual energy, achieving completion with a single thought.</p><p></p><p>Now, after reaching the Emperor Realm, Ye Xiao found that he could form this intangible domain into a tangible, fixed domain.</p><p></p><p>Within this domain, any of his techniques could be executed instantly.</p><p></p><p>Although his attack speed was already extremely fast, reaching almost no interval.</p><p></p><p>However, similarly, if the opponent was also an Emperor Realm cultivator, their speed in unleashing techniques would also be very fast, and not necessarily weaker than his own.</p><p></p><p>Within the domain range, perhaps a distance of 100,000 meters, his techniques would only take 0.001 seconds to reach, and the opponent could also release their techniques in 0.001 seconds to counter.</p><p></p><p>But if he used the domain, he could eliminate this attack interval, even if it was only a minuscule time difference, for battles between Emperor Realm cultivators, this would be extremely crucial.</p><p></p><p>At the same time, within this domain, any existence below the Emperor Realm would be utterly incapable of defending.</p><p></p><p>Because in this domain, the Emperor Realm cultivator is the sole deity!</p><p></p><p>The Emperor Realm, the master of life and death, the master of all! Only Emperor Realm experts of the same level can contend against each other's domains.</p><p></p><p>"So this is the power of the Emperor Realm?" </p><p></p><p>Ye Xiao couldn't help but sigh deeply.</p><p></p><p>Before reaching the Emperor Realm, he had imagined countless times how powerful the Emperor Realm truly was. But only after truly reaching the Emperor Realm could he genuinely feel the might contained within.</p><p></p><p>This domineering power! The shock it brought was unprecedented.</p><p></p><p>Ye Xiao cupped his hands and expressed his gratitude to the side towards the Tyrant King.</p><p></p><p>"Thank you, senior."</p><p></p><p>The Tyrant King's soul waved his hand lightly, chuckling:</p><p></p><p>"You don't need to be so polite. Everything I've done was of my own volition. The bloodline genes within the human race were also bestowed upon the human race by our ancestors - the desire to become stronger, to surpass our predecessors! In my era, no one could reach this step.</p><p></p><p>Not even I could match it.</p><p></p><p>However, your appearance has now given me new hope.</p><p></p><p>You have the potential to become a true expert.</p><p></p><p>And for me to be able to witness and support the rise of a future expert, I feel an immense honor!"</p><p></p><p>Ye Xiao could sense the other party's emotions.</p><p></p><p>It was the admiration of an elder for a junior, as well as the mutual respect between experts.</p><p></p><p>Moreover, he had placed a hope upon Ye Xiao, the hope of becoming a top-tier expert.</p><p></p><p>Just like a teacher who has cultivated an exceptionally outstanding disciple.</p><p></p><p>"Even so, I still need to thank the senior for your assistance."</p><p></p><p>"Haha, I've accepted your sincerity. Keep working hard! If in the future you can become a Divine Realm expert and uncover the mystery that our ancestors never found, come back and tell me what that mystery is, and I will be completely satisfied."</p><p></p><p>Ye Xiao nodded, and the Tyrant King spoke again:</p><p></p><p>"Alright, go out now! Your friends are waiting, and their situation is not looking too good."</p><p></p><p>Ye Xiao nodded again, as he had already sensed the situation outside.</p><p></p><p>Before becoming an Emperor Realm expert, the Tyrant King's legacy could still shield his perception, but now that he had become an Emperor Realm, he could no longer do so.</p><p></p><p>In fact, after absorbing the Tyrant King's divine blood, he had reached an even stronger level.</p><p></p><p>Although he had just entered the Emperor Realm, he was already not weaker than those more advanced Emperor Realm experts! Taking a deep breath, Ye Xiao stepped out.</p><p></p><p>The purple celestial thunderbolts in the sky were still raging, but with a thought, divine light instantly burst forth from Ye Xiao, forming an unmatched golden pillar that instantly pierced through the purple clouds, completely shattering and dispersing them.</p><p></p><p>The Star Beasts' eyes gleamed.</p><p></p><p>"The celestial phenomenon has disappeared, we can go in now!"</p><p></p><p>Three in the morning, nine thousand.</p><p></p><p>Seeking recommendations, seeking monthly votes.</p><p></p><p>(This chapter ends)</p>

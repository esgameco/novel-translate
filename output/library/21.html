        <h1>Chapter 21</h1>
        <div class="content">
            <p>Here is the full English translation of the Chinese excerpt:</p><p></p><p>If he could master this sword technique, he could then synthesize an extremely powerful, peerless cultivation method.</p><p></p><p>One that could rival the Domineering Saber.</p><p></p><p>Ye Xiao took the sword technique.</p><p></p><p>"How much? I'll transfer the money to you."</p><p></p><p>He spoke indifferently.</p><p></p><p>Gu Hai then glared at him unhappily, "Are you slapping my face? What do you take me for?"</p><p></p><p>Ye Xiao smiled and didn't continue discussing the money matter.</p><p></p><p>At this moment, Illusion Amethyst climbed up from below and jumped onto the table, curling up to sleep not far from Ye Xiao.</p><p></p><p>Gu Hai was taken aback, then spoke:</p><p></p><p>"Old Ye, is this your pet?"</p><p></p><p>Ye Xiao nodded.</p><p></p><p>"When did you start raising a spirit pet? But you know, if your spiritual sense hasn't awakened yet, cultivating a spiritual cultivation method and becoming a beast tamer wouldn't be bad either.</p><p></p><p>Spirit beasts can not only assist in battle, but they can also feedback a certain amount of cultivation to the beast tamer.</p><p></p><p>However, raising these things consumes a lot, it's hard to achieve results without spending money."</p><p></p><p>"I'm just raising it for fun."</p><p></p><p>"Alright, but if you really want to be a beast tamer, let me know if you need money. I don't have a lot of big money, but I do have a little.</p><p></p><p>Also, how powerful is your spirit pet? Don't train some inferior thing, that's just a bottomless pit, no matter how much money you spend, it'll be in vain.</p><p></p><p>I have an old classmate who deals in spirit beasts, he has a collection of good spirit beasts, he can even get his hands on quasi-Tiger-level spirit beasts.</p><p></p><p>I can help you negotiate the price, around 100,000, you should be able to get a quasi-Tiger-level spirit beast baby. If others buy it, it wouldn't be possible to get it for less than 120,000 or 130,000."</p><p></p><p>Ye Xiao: "..."</p><p></p><p>"For now, I'll just raise this one and explore it a bit."</p><p></p><p>Not to mention that he didn't even want to be a beast tamer in the first place, just in terms of spirit beast grades, there are three levels: Dragon, Tiger, Wolf!</p><p></p><p>The Illusion Cat's level is definitely above the Dragon level. Why would he spend money to buy a quasi-Tiger-level spirit beast baby that isn't even at the Tiger level? Of course, the most important thing is that a quasi-Tiger-level spirit beast baby actually costs 100,000! This doesn't fit his consumption concept.</p><p></p><p>Gu Hai nodded.</p><p></p><p>"Alright, let me know if you need anything. I'm leaving now, I've been away for too long, I'm afraid the new guy can't handle it."</p><p></p><p>"Mm, go ahead."</p><p></p><p>After Gu Hai left, Ye Xiao immediately began to study this book.</p><p></p><p>To be honest, he really couldn't understand this ancient book very well, because all the words in it were ancient characters.</p><p></p><p>But the good thing about his Golden Book spiritual sense is that as long as he has seen the characters once, he can record the cultivation method and start cultivating, without needing to understand every single character.</p><p></p><p>After recording the entire cultivation method, he let his spiritual sense cultivate it, while he continued to search for spiritual cultivation methods.</p><p></p><p>The spiritual cultivation method he tried this noon showed him a new direction.</p><p></p><p>Spiritual cultivation methods are very powerful, shockingly so. Especially after perfectly mastering spiritual power, when used properly, it can even unleash forces comparable to spiritual energy.</p><p></p><p>If his own cultivation couldn't make a breakthrough overnight, reaching the Divine Ancestor realm.</p><p></p><p>Then improving in multiple aspects is also a way to indirectly enhance his strength.</p><p></p><p>However, since there are few spiritual cultivation methods, the area he manages hasn't found many.</p><p></p><p>"Duang~!"</p><p></p><p>The sound of the off-work bell rang, Ye Xiao closed the book and stretched.</p><p></p><p>The spiritual cultivation method foundation in his mind had only increased to three.</p><p></p><p>Here is my translation of the Chinese excerpt:</p><p></p><p>The distance to fusion is still far away, Ye Xiao thought as he stretched.</p><p></p><p>"It seems I'll need to find a way to go check out some other areas later on," he said.</p><p></p><p>Huan Liuli couldn't help but speak up: "Why don't you come sneak a look at night? At night there won't be anyone here, so you should be able to read whichever book you want without any problems."</p><p></p><p>Ye Xiao glanced at her. "Do you eat meals while you're using the toilet?"</p><p></p><p>Huan Liuli shook her head. "Of course not, I'm not a lunatic."</p><p></p><p>"Then why are you working during the time you should be resting?"</p><p></p><p>Huan Liuli: "..."</p><p></p><p>She realized she just couldn't keep up with Ye Xiao's pace of thinking.</p><p></p><p>If it were her, she'd definitely read books both day and night, as long as it could strengthen her abilities - why sleep at all? Only someone with a screw loose would sleep.</p><p></p><p>In fact, while Ye Xiao did want to grow stronger, he didn't want to devote all his thoughts to cultivation. In his previous life, the torment of his illness meant he couldn't properly experience life, so in this life he just wants to live safely and more fulfillingly, with more substance.</p><p></p><p>If he just focused on cultivation every moment, how would that be any different from lying in a sickbed before? There are unpredictable twists and turns in life, and even if his cultivation reached an extremely high level, there will always be beings stronger than him out there. </p><p></p><p>If he just keeps pushing himself in cultivation without actually experiencing life, and then ends up meeting an absolute top expert who kills him in an instant, what would be the point of all that cultivation? This life shouldn't be wasted either.</p><p></p><p>So cultivation is something he'll just do diligently, without going overboard. Avoiding trouble on a daily basis will be safer than trying to raise his cultivation realm.</p><p></p><p>After dinner, the divine soul had already cultivated the last page of the basic sword techniques to the great perfection realm. At this point, the paper recording the nine basic sword techniques began to slowly emit a golden glow.</p><p></p><p>They could be fused now! Ye Xiao returned to his rented room, sealing himself in a tightly closed room to begin fusing the sword techniques.</p><p></p><p>Just as he expected, the light emanating from his body was completely contained within the room, not leaking out at all. As he cultivated the sword techniques, the entire room was filled with sword qi, constantly swirling and humming.</p><p></p><p>The sword techniques coalesced into nine large characters in his divine soul. Draw! Slash! Chop! Carve! Whip! Thrust! Fling! Spin! Sheathe! From drawing the sword to sheathing it, all in one continuous flow! All the sword might, sword momentum, and sword techniques were gradually blending together into one sword...</p><p></p><p>Huan Liuli was stationed in the courtyard watching the gate, grumbling, "I'm a cat, not a dog!"</p><p></p><p>Alas, Ye Xiao couldn't hear her complaints.</p><p></p><p>The night passed quickly, and when Ye Xiao woke up the next morning, the nine basic sword techniques had completely fused into one.</p><p></p><p>"It's done!" he exhaled.</p><p></p><p>Heavenly Slashing Sword! Completed! The Heavenly Slashing Sword, just like the Tyrant Saber, contains the myriad phenomena of the sword arts in a single strike. This is the supreme sword intent, the great perfection of sword techniques, with endless transformations that defy comprehension, and thus unstoppable power.</p><p></p><p>As long as one's cultivation is sufficient, this sword could even sever the heavens.</p><p></p><p>Ye Xiao's cultivation had also risen significantly, not quite reaching the early Saint-Emperor Realm, but over halfway there.</p><p></p><p>Even so, with the Tyrant Saber, Heavenly Slashing Sword, Purple Lotus Star Sea, and other top-tier techniques, Ye Xiao's combat power was already enough to defeat opponents above his level, truly towering over the crowd.</p>

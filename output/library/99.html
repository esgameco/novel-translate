        <h1>Chapter 99</h1>
        <div class="content">
            <p>Here is the full English translation of the Chinese excerpt:</p><p></p><p>After all, the forging technique is not a combat technique, so it's not as troublesome as that.</p><p></p><p>The synthesis has already been completed, so Ye Xiao locked Huan Liuli outside the door.</p><p></p><p>"Watch the door, I won't call you, and you're not allowed to come in."</p><p></p><p>Huan Liuli grumbled.</p><p></p><p>"What's so great about it? Do you really treat our family as servants? In another three hundred years, let's see how our family will deal with you."</p><p></p><p>As soon as the words fell, a dazzling golden light radiated from the crack of the door.</p><p></p><p>This caused Huan Liuli's flames to gradually extinguish, and her brows furrowed.</p><p></p><p>"This guy... has become stronger again? Did he eat some immortal elixir? How come his cultivation is rising like a rocket?</p><p></p><p>Star beasts can automatically grow stronger as they age, and our family's star beast has the dragon bloodline, so the speed of its cultivation improvement can be said to be the fastest. But compared to him, it feels like trash.</p><p></p><p>If this continues, in three hundred years, our family may not even be able to defeat him.</p><p></p><p>But after pondering for a moment, she clenched her small pink fist.</p><p></p><p>"No, our family is the Illusion Cat, a star beast with the dragon bloodline. How can we give up hope? Add another fifty years.</p><p></p><p>After three hundred and fifty years, our family will surely soar to the sky and make Ye Xiao our pet."</p><p></p><p>In the room, Ye Xiao's forging techniques had all been integrated, and a new forging technique was quickly formed.</p><p></p><p>Supernatural Craftsmanship! What a perfunctory name, so lame!</p><p></p><p>Those who don't know might think it's an idiom.</p><p></p><p>Then, after waiting for a night, the golden book automatically completed the cultivation of the technique.</p><p></p><p>The next morning, when Ye Xiao woke up, he immediately used the materials he had prepared in advance to forge a weapon.</p><p></p><p>The Supernatural Craftsmanship was in operation, and spiritual energy formed a high-temperature area in front of him.</p><p></p><p>After throwing in a thousand blocks of pig iron, a portion of molten iron was quickly refined, and some impurities were also generated.</p><p></p><p>But this time, the amount of molten iron refined was much less than before.</p><p></p><p>Previously, when Ye Xiao refined the molten iron, he could refine enough to forge a weapon.</p><p></p><p>But now, he could only refine enough to forge a small nail.</p><p></p><p>"So little?" Ye Xiao was somewhat surprised. It seems that the Supernatural Craftsmanship technique is indeed much stronger.</p><p></p><p>After all, it is an imperial art! It is far beyond the reach of basic techniques.</p><p></p><p>"This little bit is not enough to forge a weapon, so I'll just forge a small throwing knife."</p><p></p><p>Ye Xiao forged it into aç²¾iron throwing knife, then withdrew the technique, and with a thought, the throwing knife was in his hand.</p><p></p><p>"Looking at the grade of this throwing knife, it should have already reached the Grandmaster level. I previously doubted that pig iron could not forge Grandmaster-level weapons, but I ended up slapping myself in the face.</p><p></p><p>But this is good, the stronger the Supernatural Craftsmanship, the better it is for me.</p><p></p><p>If I can forge Grandmaster-level weapons using the essence refined from pig iron, then if I use better materials, I might be able to forge even better ones, right?"</p><p></p><p>Forging techniques only provide the ability to forge, but to forge reasonable weapons and armor, you also need certain materials.</p><p></p><p>It is said that to forge higher-grade weapons, you also need the souls of star beasts or powerful warriors, sealing them into the weapons and fusing them together.</p><p></p><p>Only in this way can the strongest weapons be forged.</p><p></p><p>This is no different from the ancient weapon-forging masters of the past world.</p><p></p><p>However, the souls of ordinary beasts are not interesting after being forged, and the improvement is not great. High-grade beast souls are rare and hard to find.</p><p></p><p>At this point, Ye Xiao suddenly thought of a certain someone - the Ael King! He is at the Divine Ancestor level, and his flesh and blood...</p><p></p><p>Here is the full English translation of the Chinese excerpt:</p><p></p><p>His body was also very powerful, and he could definitely forge a good set of weapons or armor.</p><p></p><p>The Seven Star Conjunction was coming soon, and he didn't know if the King of Aer would come out at that time.</p><p></p><p>If he were to come out, he would slaughter him and use his physical body and soul to forge a weapon or armor. But his current cultivation was still low, and he needed to work harder.</p><p></p><p>He had already grasped the true meaning of the Martial Dao at the Innate Sixth Rank, and as long as he increased his spiritual energy cultivation, he could completely reach the Innate Sixth Rank, the realm of a Grand Master.</p><p></p><p>The higher the cultivation, the slower the progress. Even if the cultivation method was excellent, the spiritual energy required at the higher realms was much greater - it was not as simple as one plus one.</p><p></p><p>Maybe he should learn alchemy? Because alchemy was the only way to quickly increase one's cultivation.</p><p></p><p>Although alchemy was expensive, he could obtain resources by hunting star beasts individually, and then use them to refine elixirs.</p><p></p><p>It was perfect.</p><p></p><p>Having decided this, Ye Xiao put away the flying dagger and went to work.</p><p></p><p>He first bought some steamed buns and an old mother chicken, eel, and egg soup from a breakfast shop, then went to the materials store.</p><p></p><p>"Boss Xu."</p><p></p><p>Because he often bought materials, Ye Xiao and the boss were already very familiar.</p><p></p><p>Boss Xu immediately came out smiling.</p><p></p><p>"The weapon forging from yesterday, is it done?"</p><p></p><p>Ye Xiao shook his head.</p><p></p><p>"It failed yesterday."</p><p></p><p>"Oh? Unusual, you also have times when you fail? But it's no big deal, most forgers have a much higher failure rate than you, this is only your first failure, it's not a big deal."</p><p></p><p>Ye Xiao nodded, then took out a flying dagger from his pocket.</p><p></p><p>"I was rummaging around at home yesterday and found an ancestral flying dagger, can you take a look and tell me how much it's worth?"</p><p></p><p>Seeing the item, Boss Xu couldn't help but have a gleam in his eyes as he quickly took it.</p><p></p><p>"Wow, this is a Master-level flying dagger! Little Ye, your ancestors must have been extraordinary people."</p><p></p><p>Ye Xiao smiled without answering.</p><p></p><p>In fact, he was an orphan in this world, his parents having died in the fight against the star beasts long ago, and he didn't even know who his ancestors were. He had just made up the story to facilitate the sale of the flying dagger.</p><p></p><p>Boss Xu kept examining the flying dagger, unable to stop praising it.</p><p></p><p>"It's a good item. But Little Ye, the price may not be as good as you think.</p><p></p><p>You know, whether it's cultivation methods, weapons, armor, or elixirs, Master-level ones will definitely be more expensive than ordinary or extraordinary ones.</p><p></p><p>Ordinary ones are a few hundred to over a thousand, extraordinary ones are a few thousand to over ten thousand, Master-level ones can be hundreds of thousands or even millions!</p><p></p><p>But this item of yours is too small.</p><p></p><p>If it were a real longsword, the cheapskate would still sell it to you for at least six figures.</p><p></p><p>But this flying dagger of yours, about the same length as mine, is at most just a throwing weapon, very inconvenient to use, so it's hard to sell at a good price."</p><p></p><p>Ye Xiao nodded.</p><p></p><p>"I understand, just give me whatever you think is reasonable."</p><p></p><p>"Hmm."</p><p></p><p>Boss Xu pondered for a moment, then held out his hand and gestured.</p><p></p><p>"This much."</p><p></p><p>Two more updates.</p><p></p><p>I'm currently typing after work, and it's the free period, so there will be three updates per day.</p><p></p><p>After it's published, if the situation is good, I'll take a short leave and do a burst of updates.</p><p></p><p>(This chapter is complete)</p>

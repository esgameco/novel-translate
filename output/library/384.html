        <h1>Chapter 384</h1>
        <div class="content">
            <p>Here is the full English translation of the Chinese excerpt:</p><p></p><p>Ye Xiao felt that this was it.</p><p></p><p>He hadn't done anything, yet this group of people had discovered him.</p><p></p><p>You say, you rich young masters and heiresses, with full stomachs and nothing better to do, how wonderful it would be if you discussed cultivation among yourselves?</p><p></p><p>If that's really too much, you could at least find a hotel, enjoy the moonlight, and ponder the philosophy of life, right?</p><p></p><p>Idling around and talking nonsense, what kind of nonsense have you stirred up?</p><p></p><p>A talent that props up the heavens? You're really too idle.</p><p></p><p>"Ye Xiao, the commotion you've caused this time is truly too great. They seem determined to find you.</p><p></p><p>To protect you, the Emperor specially instructed us not to contact you or come find you casually.</p><p></p><p>I only dared to say a few words to you today because I had told the lecturer that I was coming to the library to look for some books."</p><p></p><p>Ye Xiao shook his head.</p><p></p><p>His ancestors had once said that not everyone in the XuanYuan Clan was good. If he were to reveal his talents, it would make many people envious.</p><p></p><p>If he didn't stay low-key and cultivate properly, it might even pose a threat to his life.</p><p></p><p>With such monstrous aptitude, he would be the most coveted of all delicacies. Anyone who saw it would find it hard to resist drooling.</p><p></p><p>He only liked being a gourmet, not wanting to become the delicacy himself.</p><p></p><p>"For now, I still want to be more independent. As my ancestors once said, 'A tree that stands alone in the forest will surely be blown down by the wind.' I still hope you senior predecessors will continue to keep this secret for me.</p><p></p><p>When my strength is a bit stronger, I will then choose whether to reveal my identity or not."</p><p></p><p>"Alright. Actually, this old man sometimes feels a bit incompetent. If our old bones had a bit more strength and status in the XuanYuan Clan, we could have protected you.</p><p></p><p>Then you wouldn't have to hide and sneak around like a mouse.</p><p></p><p>This is the incompetence of us elders!"</p><p></p><p>Ye Xiao shook his head.</p><p></p><p>"Senior, you speak too highly of me. If it weren't for you all steadfastly guarding the human world for a long time, not allowing the star beasts to invade, I might not have existed at all, let alone achieved today's accomplishments. Please do not belittle yourselves, you will always be the seniors I respect."</p><p></p><p>North Hall Ce nodded.</p><p></p><p>"I'll head back now. If you ever need anything, remember to tell me. As I've said, we old bones will definitely get it for you, no matter what you need."</p><p></p><p>"Thank you, senior."</p><p></p><p>The two bid farewell, and Ye Xiao began to read again.</p><p></p><p>He now needed to complete his spiritual cultivation technique.</p><p></p><p>Spiritual cultivation techniques were very practical, but his own technique - the Supremely Mysterious Heavenly Gale - had long since become ineffective.</p><p></p><p>It was only an imperial art, while he now possessed royal arts.</p><p></p><p>It wasn't that it was the only one that hadn't been upgraded to a divine art yet.</p><p></p><p>Because he also had the Decree Command and Poison Cultivation, which hadn't been upgraded either.</p><p></p><p>It might be because he hadn't used them for a long time, so he momentarily forgot about their upgrades.</p><p></p><p>After the incident with the Black Soul Clan, Ye Xiao decided to first complete this cultivation technique.</p><p></p><p>Because sometimes he needed to use spiritual cultivation techniques to help him search the opponent's memories.</p><p></p><p>Of course, it could also serve as a specific defensive ability to prevent others from mental exploration.</p><p></p><p>As for the Decree Command and Poison Cultivation, they were basically useless to Ye Xiao, so he would just cultivate them as needed.</p><p></p><p>After a few days of effort, Ye Xiao finally gathered the three imperial-level spiritual cultivation techniques and could now synthesize them.</p><p></p><p>After clicking the synthesis, it only took a day or two to synthesize a divine-level spiritual cultivation technique - the Great Dao Divine Thought! With this technique, he wouldn't have to bother interrogating spies in the future, he could just directly scan their memories.</p><p></p><p>Meanwhile, in the starry sky above, among the hundred tribes, a grand celebratory assembly had been organized.</p><p></p><p>The top experts from the hundred tribes gathered together, the various clans filled with joy and excitement.</p><p></p><p>Among the hundred tribes, the strongest was the Rain God Tribe, ranking 42nd in the starry sky.</p><p></p><p>Presiding over this assembly was naturally the powerful expert leading the Rain God Tribe - Zhu Chun Qiu, a Slay God Realm cultivator at the fifth level!</p><p></p><p>He cupped his hands and addressed the crowd.</p><p></p><p>"Today, I am honored that you have entrusted me to preside over this grand assembly.</p><p></p><p>As you all know, recently, in that divine king's tomb, we of the hundred tribes fought with the XuanYuan Clan with all our might! In the end, we successfully seized the only treasure in the divine king's tomb - a bottle of divine water from the ancient times!</p><p></p><p>This bottle of divine water is extremely rare and precious.</p><p></p><p>Not only is it an extraordinary treasure that can greatly boost one's cultivation, but it also symbolizes the unity of our hundred tribes in defeating the XuanYuan Clan!"</p><p></p><p>These words immediately stirred the hearts of everyone present.</p><p></p><p>The XuanYuan Clan was ranked 19th among the clans. </p><p></p><p>The higher the clan's rank, the greater the gap in strength between them.</p><p></p><p>Although the hundred tribes were numerous, they had always been suppressed by the XuanYuan Clan.</p><p></p><p>But now, they had won against them once.</p><p></p><p>The significance of this was deeply profound.</p><p></p><p>Even more so than the divine water itself.</p><p></p><p>Here is the full English translation of the Chinese excerpt:</p><p></p><p>The value of this is even more profound. <div class="contentadv"><script>loadAdv(7,3);</script></div>Zhu Chunqiu spoke again:</p><p></p><p>"Before we formed the alliance of the hundred tribes, we had already said that no matter what, we must share the hardships, life and death, and work together.</p><p></p><p>Now, although we have obtained this bottle of divine water and it is not much, I still want to fairly distribute it to the representatives of each divine tribe."</p><p></p><p>Hearing this, the crowd nodded approvingly.</p><p></p><p>What Zhu Chunqiu did was indeed very good.</p><p></p><p>Although this item is divine water from the ancient times and is of great value, Zhu Chunqiu did not take advantage of his own strength being greater than everyone else's to forcefully hoard it all for himself.</p><p></p><p>Just for this spirit, he deserves the title of "hero" and is worthy of being the current alliance representative of the hundred tribes.</p><p></p><p>"Senior Zhu is noble-minded, we admire him!"</p><p></p><p>"Senior Zhu is fair and just in his actions, winning our wholehearted approval! In the future, we will devote ourselves to serving him wholeheartedly."</p><p></p><p>"With Senior Zhu commanding us, although our hundred tribes are small, what do we have to fear from the mighty Xuanyuan Clan?"</p><p></p><p>The crowd spoke passionately, one after another.</p><p></p><p>Seeing this scene, Zhu Chunqiu nodded in satisfaction.</p><p></p><p>He actually didn't want to part with this bottle of divine water. There was not much to begin with, and he still had to share it with everyone?</p><p></p><p>Being able to get just a small sip would already be very good.</p><p></p><p>Although it's just a small sip, it is the priceless ancient divine water.</p><p></p><p>And how precious is the entire bottle?</p><p></p><p>It is something that cannot be measured by ordinary standards.</p><p></p><p>But he had no choice, as he is now the representative of the alliance.</p><p></p><p>If he did not act fairly, others would not trust him, and if they did not trust him, his subsequent orders would not be able to be carried out.</p><p></p><p>After all, there are many divine tombs here, and there will be plenty of opportunities to profit in the future.</p><p></p><p>As long as he firmly grasps the position of authority, he will be able to take advantage of various links to gain benefits for himself.</p><p></p><p>Strictly speaking, that would definitely be more profitable.</p><p></p><p>Perhaps there might even be another divine king's tomb? It's impossible that the other divine king's tomb would only have this one bottle of divine water left, right?</p><p></p><p>So, after much thought, he finally decided to distribute it fairly to everyone.</p><p></p><p>Let everyone share the blessings, this is what a good leader should do.</p><p></p><p>"Good! Let's start the distribution now. One hundred cups, one cup per tribe, and no one can take more."</p><p></p><p>"Yes!"</p><p></p><p>Under the gaze of all, he quickly opened the bottle cap and began to pour the first cup.</p><p></p><p>Everyone couldn't help but widen their eyes, staring intently at the divine water.</p><p></p><p>"Wow - this divine water is yellow in color!"</p><p></p><p>"The divine water truly lives up to its name! It's just different. The color has turned yellow, how much spiritual energy must it contain?"</p><p></p><p>"Look, when it's poured out, there are even bubbles, sizzling, the spiritual energy is so abundant!"</p><p></p><p>"Just this one cup, if I could take a sip, that would be amazing. I might even be able to instantly advance a cultivation level."</p><p></p><p>"You're thinking too much! The divine water is very powerful, but unfortunately it's not our turn to drink it. These are things that only the leaders can drink."</p><p></p><p>"Ah! It's such a pity! If only my cultivation was a bit higher. Our divine tribe's strong ones are already so few, and those who came this time are not many either. If only my cultivation could reach the Emperor Realm, above the fifty dragons, then I would definitely be one of the leaders this time."</p><p></p><p>Soon, under the envious gaze of the crowd, the precious ancient divine water was divided into exactly one hundred cups, with each divine tribe receiving one.</p><p></p><p>The representatives one by one came forward to take their cup.</p><p></p><p>Without waiting for Zhu Chunqiu to speak, they had already started pouring it into their mouths.</p><p></p><p>This is a rare ancient divine water that appears once in a millennium! They had finally gotten the chance to drink it, and no one wanted anything to go wrong. As soon as they could drink it, they drank it.</p><p></p><p>Some even licked the bottom of the cup after finishing, still reluctant to part with the taste.</p><p></p><p>"This ancient divine water is truly remarkable! The taste is simply exquisite!"</p><p></p><p>"It has a faint taste of seawater. A bit salty. But more of it is sweet. I had just put it in my mouth, and it went down my throat and into my stomach. It's so refreshing and lingering!"</p><p></p><p>"To be able to drink such a supreme delicacy in my lifetime is truly rare! This trip to the Canglang Star Domain has been truly worthwhile! It's worth it!"</p><p></p><p>"Me too!"</p><p></p><p>"I envy you all so much! My mouth is much bigger than yours, but as soon as I put it in my mouth, it went straight down my throat and into my stomach without me even tasting the flavor. </p><p></p><p>How annoying, I should have just poured it directly onto my tongue instead of drinking it so quickly."</p><p></p><p>The people below, seeing this scene and hearing these words, were simply jealous, admiring, and hateful to the extreme.</p><p></p><p>Zhu Chunqiu also took a sip, but he didn't drink it as quickly as they did. Instead, he savored it slowly, as if he was drinking tea.</p><p></p><p>"Sizzle sizzle sizzle, it truly lives up to the name of ancient divine water!"</p><p></p><p>　Six more, eighteen thousand.</p><p></p><p>　　Seeking recommendations, seeking monthly votes.</p><p></p><p>　　I'll have some noodles to warm myself up, my hands are too cold to type.</p><p></p><p>　　I've been busy all day and haven't eaten yet, sorry.</p><p></p><p>　　　(This chapter is complete)</p>

        <h1>Chapter 344</h1>
        <div class="content">
            <p>Here is the full English translation of the Chinese excerpt:</p><p></p><p>The powerful cultivator of the Winged God Tribe couldn't help but give the other side a reminder before they began.</p><p></p><p>Leizer smiled slightly.</p><p></p><p>"Don't worry, this formation of mine, even if it's against someone stronger than me, as long as they don't surpass the Emperor Realm 60 Dragons, they will definitely die without a doubt."</p><p></p><p>"Is this formation really that powerful? If I'm not mistaken, your cultivation should have just reached the Emperor Realm 41 Dragons, right?"</p><p></p><p>The powerful cultivator of the Winged God Tribe couldn't help but raise his question again.</p><p></p><p>However, at this moment, a powerful cultivator of the Titan Ape Tribe suddenly spoke:</p><p></p><p>"Could this formation be the Thunderclap Divine Formation of the Thunder God Tribe?"</p><p></p><p>Leizer chuckled.</p><p></p><p>"I see there's someone who knows their stuff."</p><p></p><p>The powerful cultivator of the Titan Ape Tribe saw Leizer's confirmation and his expression became somewhat grave, but his gaze also became more determined.</p><p></p><p>"If that's the case, then there shouldn't be any major problems.</p><p>This formation, our Titan Ape Tribe, has also heard of it.</p><p></p><p>It is said that the Thunder God Tribe's technique can silently and stealthily take the life of a cultivator at the same level!</p><p></p><p>It can even kill enemies of a higher realm! Many people have died to this move.</p><p></p><p>However, this move requires a large number of powerful experts to continuously provide spiritual energy to maintain the formation."</p><p></p><p>Leizer nodded.</p><p></p><p>"You've hit the nail on the head. The one from the Xuanyuan Tribe who came this time is at most only the Emperor Realm 64 Dragons - Sword Flow Cloud!</p><p></p><p>Aside from him, no one else would be able to withstand this formation.</p><p>If it weren't for the fact that it has certain limitations and can't be used repeatedly in a short period of time, as it would put a tremendous burden on the body, I would have already struck down those from the Xuanyuan Tribe."</p><p></p><p>Hearing this, the powerful cultivator of the Winged God Tribe finally put down his worries and doubts.</p><p></p><p>"Good! Then let's start as soon as possible. I'm already itching to kill that damned bastard!"</p><p></p><p>"Alright, all of you put your hands on the formation and start channeling your spiritual energy to activate it."</p><p></p><p>Everyone immediately did as he said, and in the next moment, the entire formation was lit up, with azure lightning sparks dancing playfully and joyfully on the formation.</p><p></p><p>Seeing this, Leizer also immediately took action.</p><p></p><p>He clapped his hands, and the power within him began to stir.</p><p></p><p>In the next moment, accompanied by the crashing of thunder, a void-like eye seemed to open up in front of him.</p><p></p><p>"Great ancestor of the Thunder God, please grant me the power to slay all! Turn the power of thunder into the spear of vengeance and help me slay the enemies of the Thunder God Tribe!"</p><p></p><p>After the incantation, a lightning spear continuously emitting lightning sparks began to slowly take shape in front of the black hole.</p><p></p><p>The crowd could feel an extremely terrifying aura from this lightning spear.</p><p></p><p>They finally seemed to understand the terrifying nature of this move.</p><p></p><p>With just this one lightning spear, to put it bluntly, there was no one present who could withstand it.</p><p></p><p>Even if they didn't die, they would still be severely injured.</p><p></p><p>The combat prowess of the Thunder God Tribe is truly formidable, worthy of being the renowned battle tribe in the starry sky!</p><p></p><p>"Maikang! Quickly infuse the essence blood of your Winged God Tribe into it, imbue it with a spirit. It will then automatically seek out the one who slaughtered your Winged God Tribe."</p><p></p><p>"Okay!"</p><p></p><p>Maikang snapped his fingers, drawing out a few drops of fresh blood.</p><p>In the blink of an eye, they were all poured in front of the lightning spear.</p><p></p><p>The next moment, the lightning spear let out a roar of fury and instantly vanished from its original spot, turning into a beam of light that directly charged into the spatial corridor in front of them.</p><p></p><p>Seeing that terrifying speed, Maikang smiled, a smile of great joy.</p><p>He had always been quite dissatisfied with the Xuanyuan Tribe, but couldn't act rashly before. Now he had this powerful technique, he was sure he could kill the other party.</p><p></p><p>First, he would collect a bit of interest, and the rest could be settled later. He was even already thinking about how to thank Leizer, pondering what kind of words to use for better communication.</p><p>Should he say "thank you"? Or should he do something else? Unlike this side, Maikang had an excited expression on his face.</p><p></p><p>On Ye Xiao's side, he had already finished eating and started meditating in bed. This was a daily routine for him.</p><p></p><p>However, at this moment, he suddenly sensed an unusual power in the void, locking onto him.</p><p>This power was not too strong, but at least it had reached the Emperor Realm 60 Dragons, which was already an extremely powerful force compared to others.</p><p></p><p>Fortunately, his cultivation had already reached the Emperor Realm 108 Dragons, almost at its peak. So his perception was particularly strong, and he couldn't escape the other party's detection.</p><p></p><p>The next moment, a black spatial corridor suddenly appeared above Ye Xiao's head.</p><p>Immediately after, an extremely terrifying lightning power surged towards Ye Xiao's brow with an unstoppable momentum.</p><p>That murderous intent was clearly revealed...</p><p></p><p>Here is the full English translation of the Chinese excerpt:</p><p></p><p>The lightning spear emerged in all its glory.</p><p></p><p>Seeing the lightning spear about to pierce Ye Xiao's brow, Ye Xiao activated his Mahayana divine body and simply stretched out two fingers, easily pinching the lightning spear.</p><p></p><p>The lightning spear stopped in midair, rigid and trembling, as if it had sensed the fear.</p><p></p><p>Ye Xiao moved his fingers slightly, and with a crack, the lightning spear was crushed and shattered by his two fingers.</p><p></p><p>"Petty tricks. Let me play with you a bit."</p><p></p><p>With that, Ye Xiao unleashed the Celestial Finger technique!</p><p></p><p>With a flick of his finger, a force far exceeding the previous lightning spear shot out, directly towards the opponent's face. "Puchi!"</p><p></p><p>Zelerl, who was in the Western region, suddenly spat out a mouthful of fresh blood.</p><p></p><p>The onlookers were shocked. What happened? Zelerl shouted, "He's attacking! Quickly, pour all your power into the formation. I need to use the attack to block him, or else we'll all be in trouble."</p><p></p><p>Hearing this, the faces of the onlookers became grave. Everyone exerted their full strength to pour their power into the formation, helping Zelerl resist Ye Xiao's attack.</p><p></p><p>An even stronger lightning spear formed and shot into the transmission channel.</p><p></p><p>But moments later, Zelerl spat out blood again, his face pale.</p><p></p><p>It was clear that this second lightning spear had also been shattered.</p><p></p><p>Attacks that were forcibly broken would rebound and inflict secondary injuries on Zelerl.</p><p></p><p>But Zelerl had no time to dwell on this.</p><p></p><p>He had to shatter the opponent's attack, or else when it came out from the channel, he would be doomed! This formation had a flaw - once activated, nothing could be allowed in the spatial channel, or else it would be difficult to close.</p><p></p><p>He had no choice.</p><p></p><p>The lightning spears formed again!</p><p></p><p>But this time, it was not a single spear, but two, three, four, five... The onlookers, having had their spiritual energy drained, had faces that were pale and somewhat ashen.</p><p></p><p>"Zelerl, are you done yet? At this rate, we won't be able to hold on even before you succeed."</p><p></p><p>Zelerl's face was even paler than theirs, with sweat pouring down his head like a torrential rain. His body trembled slightly with every second, as he strained to maintain his composure.</p><p></p><p>All the lightning spears were shattered by Ye Xiao's attacks.</p><p></p><p>Any spear that collided with the Celestial Finger was mercilessly destroyed.</p><p></p><p>One, two, three, four, five...</p><p></p><p>Each time a spear was destroyed, Zelerl grew weaker.</p><p></p><p>And his inner fear increased as well! "Damn it!"</p><p></p><p>Finally, before Ye Xiao's Celestial Finger could arrive, Zelerl's fighting spirit completely collapsed.</p><p></p><p>He couldn't hold on anymore and chose to surrender.</p><p></p><p>If he continued, he would be dead for sure when the attack arrived.</p><p></p><p>So he let out a fierce roar and detonated his own arms.</p><p></p><p>"Ahâ€”Break!"</p><p></p><p>Boom! His arms exploded in a shower of blood, quickly merging into the formation, instantly causing it to fail.</p><p></p><p>The formation stopped draining the spiritual energy from the group, leaving them stunned as they looked at Zelerl.</p><p></p><p>Zelerl revealed a bitter smile, as if he had narrowly escaped death.</p><p></p><p>"Hehe, finally turned this thing off."</p><p></p><p>However, just as the group was about to ask what happened, the space in front of Zelerl was suddenly blasted open, like a shattered mirror.</p><p></p><p>Crack!</p><p></p><p>The space ruptured, and a powerful, unmatched force directly surged into Zelerl's body.</p><p></p><p>Boom! In an instant, Zelerl was reduced to a bloody mist.</p><p></p><p>The blood splattered across the faces of the group, leaving them all petrified on the spot.</p><p></p><p>Was this a joke? They had gathered so many people's power and even used the secret formation of the Thunder God Tribe. </p><p></p><p>Yet it ended up like this? The opponent had only unleashed a single attack!</p><p></p><p>After all, the lightning spears Zelerl had formed earlier were powered by the collective strength of their group. </p><p></p><p>Those numerous bolts of lightning should have at least worn down the opponent's attack, right? Even to the point that Zelerl had to self-destruct his arms to forcibly shut down the formation.</p><p></p><p>But the opponent still broke through the just-sealed spatial barrier and slaughtered Zelerl.</p><p></p><p>And it was an instant kill.</p><p></p><p>Just how terrifying was this person's power? Had he already reached the Godly Realm?</p>

        <h1>Chapter 398</h1>
        <div class="content">
            <p>Here is the full English translation of the Chinese excerpt:</p><p></p><p>"This is the place, this is the location."</p><p></p><p>The crowd fell down one by one and began to search all around.</p><p></p><p>Everyone wanted to be the first to find that precious treasure! They knew they had no chance of being able to use an item of that level.</p><p></p><p>Not only did they not have the qualifications to use it.</p><p></p><p>But the principle of "the innocent man bears the guilt" is also very clear to them.</p><p></p><p>If they dared to claim that thing as their own, once discovered, they would be slaughtered without a doubt.</p><p></p><p>The reason they wanted to find this treasure was to offer it to the higher-ups, like the young masters.</p><p></p><p>No matter who they offered it to, just finding this item would be a great achievement for them.</p><p></p><p>But after searching for a long time, the crowd still couldn't find any clues, and could only sigh in resignation.</p><p></p><p>Ning Zhiyuan said helplessly:</p><p></p><p>"It seems to have left this place. If I'm not mistaken, the treasure should have its own spiritual awareness. With it running away like this, it's like trying to find a needle in the ocean.</p><p></p><p>It doesn't want us to find it, and we may never find it in our lifetime."</p><p></p><p>Master Fulong nodded, unable to hide the look of regret on his face.</p><p></p><p>They had finally encountered the legendary treasure, but he failed to seize the opportunity to find it immediately, allowing it to escape. From now on, trying to find it again would be as difficult as ascending to the heavens.</p><p></p><p>Ning Zhiyuan spoke again:</p><p></p><p>"Master Fulong, do you think it might have been refined by someone? And now it has been taken away by someone?"</p><p></p><p>Before Master Fulong could respond, the other masters burst out laughing.</p><p></p><p>"Haha, Young Master Ning, you're really too imaginative! Do you think treasures can be refined by anyone who wants to?"</p><p></p><p>"That's right, Young Master Ning, this kind of thing cannot be easily refined. At least we Xuanyuan Clan's master refiners do not have the ability to refine it.</p><p></p><p>Treasures are usually Ninth-Grade Imperial Weapons, absorbing the spiritual energy of heaven and earth, the essence of the sun and moon, accumulated over years and years. It takes 99% effort and 1% chance to finally break through to the level of an Imperial Treasure.</p><p></p><p>Even if someone could create an Imperial Treasure, it would only be the top-tier refiners among the top few races in the starry sky who could achieve this.</p><p></p><p>The Canglang Star Domain is an extremely remote place.</p><p></p><p>To put it bluntly, this place is a complete backwater.</p><p></p><p>If it weren't for the discovery of a large number of divine tombs, we wouldn't have come to this place at all.</p><p></p><p>How could such a high-level refiner possibly appear here?"</p><p></p><p>For some reason, at this moment, Ning Zhiyuan suddenly thought of a certain person.</p><p></p><p>That figure! Isn't he also an extremely rare and extraordinary genius? But didn't he also appear in this extremely remote place? Could it be that he was the one who refined it?</p><p></p><p>Ning Zhiyuan was shocked by his own crazy thoughts.</p><p></p><p>Ah! How could he have such a terrifying idea?</p><p></p><p>It's true that he is extremely talented, but how could he be so unbelievably extraordinary?</p><p></p><p>If he could even create a treasure, then who else would need to live? It's definitely not possible that it was him!</p><p></p><p>These past few days, he has truly been influenced and frightened by him.</p><p></p><p>"But speaking of which, it's quite strange that there was no lightning tribulation just now."</p><p></p><p>"Yes! It's really a strange thing. Such a powerful existence appeared, but there was no lightning tribulation."</p><p></p><p>"Perhaps it has already successfully broken through to the level of a treasure, and it's only now just emerging from the ground.</p><p></p><p>That's why it didn't trigger a lightning tribulation, but only triggered the reverence of these weapons."</p><p></p><p>"I see. I wonder if it also came from the hands of those ancient powerful divine kings. And after countless days and nights of evolution, it finally broke through to the level of a treasure?"</p><p></p><p>As they spoke, everyone in their minds seemed to imagine a resolute divine weapon, holding a single weapon, silently enduring loneliness and desolation, enduring the erosion of wind and snow, from the ancient times, buried underground all along, relying on its unyielding and unwavering spirit, finally evolving to the level of a treasure!</p><p></p><p>What an admirable spirit this is!</p><p></p><p>Ning Zhiyuan and the others couldn't help but clench their fists, inwardly determined to learn from this treasure, to learn its spirit of arduous struggle, its unyielding quality!</p><p></p><p>"By the way, Young Master Ning. This matter is of great importance. Although the treasure has escaped and we cannot guarantee we'll encounter it again, I think you still need to inform the Xuanyuan Clan about this."</p><p></p><p>Ning Zhiyuan nodded.</p><p></p><p>"That's for sure. Such a big event must be reported to the clan. Moreover, I suspect the Alliance of a Hundred Tribes may have some movements next. We need to open the Great Wall Formation! </p><p></p><p>From today on, strictly inspect every person entering the Nine States, and absolutely do not allow them to enter casually.</p><p></p><p>Also, this news must be strictly protected, and absolutely not allowed to be leaked out. Violators will be severely punished!"</p><p></p><p>The crowd nodded, all agreeing with his decision.</p><p></p><p>"Well, let's leave it at that. Hopefully, the family will be able to...</p><p></p><p>Here is the full English translation of the Chinese excerpt:</p><p></p><p>Before the person arrives, we must not make any mistakes.</p><p></p><p>Ye Xiao returned home and did not take any action, but quietly looked at the few books brought out from the Poison King's tomb.</p><p></p><p>Although he did not know what had just happened?</p><p></p><p>But he was clear in his heart that there must have been something unusual happening, so that others could sense his existence.</p><p></p><p>Before figuring out this matter, he should be honest.</p><p></p><p>The next day, he went to work as usual.</p><p></p><p>Gu Hai, who had just come here to read books, was staring nervously around, then carefully approached Ye Xiao.</p><p></p><p>"Ye Xiao, do you know? Something big happened in our Jiuzhou last night."</p><p></p><p>Ye Xiao's heart sank, was it because of the forging of the Great Dragon?</p><p></p><p>He pretended to be calm and asked again:</p><p></p><p>"What happened?"</p><p></p><p>Gu Hai looked left and right, confirmed it several times, and then whispered, "In our Jiuzhou last night, a great treasure weapon appeared! It caused countless blades and weapons to kneel in worship."</p><p></p><p>Ye Xiao's heart suddenly sank.</p><p></p><p>What the hell?</p><p></p><p>A great treasure weapon? Countless blades and weapons kneeling in worship? It turned out that he was still complacent about not having the thunder tribulation, but it seemed that the Great Dragon had given him an even more powerful one.</p><p></p><p>All the blades and weapons within the entire Jiuzhou region had knelt in worship.</p><p></p><p>And it's not known whether this has happened in other places.</p><p></p><p>If this has also happened in other places, then this would be even bigger than the thunder tribulation!</p><p></p><p>Damn it!</p><p></p><p>He had already forged the Great Dragon into such a powerful existence, how could there be no extraordinary celestial phenomena occurring? However, the good thing for now is that no one knows the Great Dragon belongs to him.</p><p></p><p>Otherwise, Ye Xiao was afraid that a powerful divine king expert might suddenly appear and come to kill him and seize the treasure.</p><p></p><p>It seems that his long-term concealment of his identity was a very wise choice.</p><p></p><p>It's decided, he must be more cautious in the future.</p><p></p><p>Because it's not scary if they discover he has a treasure weapon! If they find out that he can directly mass-produce treasure weapons, that would be truly disastrous.</p><p></p><p>Probably a group of divine emperors would come to catch him and force him to forge weapons every day.</p><p></p><p>Just thinking about it makes him feel like a nightmare.</p><p></p><p>"Old Ye, do you know what a great treasure weapon is?"</p><p></p><p>Ye Xiao shook his head.</p><p></p><p>"I don't know. I've never heard of it."</p><p></p><p>"You're really out of touch, aren't you? A great treasure weapon is a peerless weapon that even divine emperors would drool over! You know? The top-tier treasure under the starry sky! I'll tell you, you can't tell anyone about this news, I've gone through a lot of effort to get this information.</p><p></p><p>I heard that Young Master Ning has issued a decree, and if this news leaks out, all the people who know about it may be beheaded!"</p><p></p><p>Ye Xiao nodded.</p><p></p><p>"Don't worry, I'm clear about this."</p><p></p><p>"That's good, I'm going to buy some breakfast, do you want me to bring you something?"</p><p></p><p>"Just bring me something random."</p><p></p><p>"Okay, I'll go now."</p><p></p><p>After Gu Hai left, it wasn't long before Yang Qian also came to Ye Xiao's side.</p><p></p><p>"Manager, do you know? Something big happened in our Jiuzhou last night, something you can't even imagine."</p><p></p><p>Ye Xiao: "(_..)!"</p><p></p><p>"Could it be about the great treasure weapon?"</p><p></p><p>Yang Qian slapped her thigh.</p><p></p><p>"How do you know about this? This is an absolutely confidential file, and I only found out with great difficulty from the ex-girlfriend of the brother-in-law of my second aunt's third cousin who works in the Ning family manor."</p><p></p><p>Ye Xiao: "(_..)!"</p><p></p><p>"Forget it, although I don't know where you got the information from, but this matter can only be known by you. You absolutely cannot tell anyone else. If others know it came from your mouth, you'll be done for."</p><p></p><p>Ye Xiao nodded, and Yang Qian left. Ye Xiao's spiritual stone started vibrating again.</p><p></p><p>The caller ID displayed was Beitang Ce! Ye Xiao: "(_..)!"</p><p></p><p>Seeing the caller ID, Ye Xiao fell into deep contemplation.</p><p></p><p>How many people have already known about this matter? At the same time, in the Ning family manor, Ning Zhiyuan was also instructing the manager in a serious tone, "Manager, you must personally supervise this matter, and this news must not be leaked out. It is related to the stability of Jiuzhou.</p><p></p><p>Once it is leaked out, a terrifying bloody storm will sweep through the entire Jiuzhou! We must hold on until the family elders arrive."</p><p></p><p>The manager nodded.</p><p></p><p>"Young Master, rest assured, as long as I'm here, this news will never step out of the Ning family manor!"</p><p></p><p>Ning Zhiyuan heaved a sigh of relief and smiled, "Then I'm relieved!"</p>

        <h1>Chapter 305</h1>
        <div class="content">
            <p>Here is the full English translation of the Chinese excerpt:</p><p></p><p>"You've finally gotten this opportunity, yet you don't want it? Are you joking with me? Youâ€”! Alas!"</p><p></p><p>Seeing Ye Xiao's calm expression, Jiang Chen became anxious and angry.</p><p></p><p>After all, not everyone would choose to sacrifice their true martial dao like Qinglong.</p><p></p><p>Moreover, and more importantly, not everyone's true martial dao has such value! It can be said without exaggeration that this is a once-in-a-lifetime opportunity.</p><p></p><p>If missed, there will absolutely be no second chance, and there's a possibility of lifelong regret.</p><p></p><p>Right now, he's like a teacher who sees a good opportunity for his student, wanting the student to seize it, but the student stubbornly refuses to learn.</p><p></p><p>If there had to be a word to describe it, it would probably be "heartbroken".</p><p></p><p>He's not Ye Xiao's elder, and he can't defeat him, otherwise he would have just tied him up and taken him.</p><p></p><p>But Ye Xiao remained calm and collected, his expression very tranquil.</p><p></p><p>"I'm not joking with you. I also know Senior Qinglong means well for me, but... I no longer need it."</p><p></p><p>Jiang Chen's pupils suddenly constricted.</p><p></p><p>"No longer need it?" What did that mean? After all, Ye Xiao had previously specially asked him to help contact the Empyrean experts in the Starry Sky.</p><p></p><p>Because he still needed that final realization.</p><p></p><p>But he only lacked that final realization.</p><p></p><p>If he had that realization, he could break through to the Empyrean realm at any time.</p><p></p><p>Could it be... could it be that in the past few days Ye Xiao went out, he had already found that realization? Had he broken through to the legendary Empyrean realm? At this moment, Jiang Chen suddenly shuddered.</p><p></p><p>He widened his eyes, staring at Ye Xiao in disbelief, and said:</p><p></p><p>"Ye Xiao, you... you... have you broken through that final realm?"</p><p></p><p>Ye Xiao nodded.</p><p></p><p>"I've been lucky recently."</p><p></p><p>Boom! After getting Ye Xiao's confirmation, it was as if another huge bomb had been dropped in Jiang Chen's mind, and this one was the biggest.</p><p></p><p>Heavenly endowed talent!</p><p></p><p>Heavenly endowed talent! A 21-year-old Human Emperor, such talent, in the future he absolutely has the opportunity to lead the people of the Nine Provinces to an even more glorious future.</p><p></p><p>Jiang Chen felt like he was looking at a rising new star.</p><p></p><p>No, this was a star that had already risen and was continuously ascending, a brilliant celestial body! Jiang Chen felt his eyes becoming moist and hot, he could even feel his eyes reddening.</p><p></p><p>He was happy for Ye Xiao, and also happy for the Nine Provinces.</p><p></p><p>There was a very touching saying that Jiang Chen felt was very fitting for his current mood.</p><p></p><p>"Why are there often tears in my eyes? Because my love for this land runs deep!" He saw in Ye Xiao the hope for the future of the Nine Provinces.</p><p></p><p>The hope for the future of the Nine Provinces was the young man before him.</p><p></p><p>"Although I no longer need Senior Qinglong's martial dao realm, he cared for me, so I can't not express my gratitude.</p><p></p><p>This flower contains my thankfulness to Senior Qinglong."</p><p></p><p>Jiang Chen wiped his eyes.</p><p></p><p>"Good! Good! I will definitely bring this flower to Qinglong."</p><p></p><p>He had already understood Ye Xiao's intention. If he guessed correctly, this flower contained an even more powerful martial dao realm.</p><p></p><p>Ye Xiao wanted to help Qinglong break through that final layer, allowing the Nine Provinces to gain another Empyrean expert! This way, the Nine Provinces would have one more Empyrean expert, and the strength of the Nine Provinces would be elevated to an even higher level, reducing the pressure when facing the future invasion of the Star Beasts.</p><p></p><p>This was also Qinglong's blessing.</p><p></p><p>If Qinglong had not been willing to sacrifice his own true martial dao to lend a hand to Ye Xiao, he might not have been able to receive Ye Xiao's gift.</p><p></p><p>In the end, everything was already destined in the mysteries of the world.</p><p></p><p>And at the same time, in the southern mountains of Jianghai City, several figures stood in the wilderness, staring intently at the highest peak among them.</p><p></p><p>On that mountain peak, there was a figure dressed plainly, carrying a long sword, standing proudly in the wilderness.</p><p></p><p>He had no aura at all, and even seemed to not exist.</p><p></p><p>If not for the others' strong cultivation and keen eyesight, and the fact that they knew he would appear there, they might not have been able to find him at all.</p><p></p><p>This was because he was too powerful, so powerful that they could not even sense his presence.</p><p></p><p>That figure was the Sword Emperor Qinglong.</p><p></p><p>And the figures appearing in the wilderness were the Second of the Four Sages of Huaxia - Firebird Zhuque, Bai Hu, as well as Sword Saint Lu Qingshan and Dao Saint Li Liushui.</p><p></p><p>There were only four of them in total.</p><p></p><p>Only these few knew about this matter.</p><p></p><p>Sword Saint Lu Qingshan and Dao Saint Li Liushui had come after inquiring with Sage Xuanwu Jiang Chen, hoping to take the opportunity to learn some insights about the Dao of the Sword, and then seize the chance to break through to the King Realm.</p><p></p><p>After all, opportunities were rare, and not everyone had the chance to witness this earth-shaking battle.</p><p></p><p>Being able to create another King Realm expert for the Nine Provinces would be a great boon.</p><p></p><p>"So that is the Sword Emperor Qinglong?"</p><p></p><p>Lu Qingshan gazed at the figure on the mountaintop, his eyes filled with admiration, respect and awe.</p><p></p><p>Qinglong gave him a feeling of being transcendent, completely unlike an ordinary martial artist.</p><p></p><p>He was like the wind, like light, like rain, as if he had already merged with the great nature around him.</p><p></p><p>Here is the full English translation of the Chinese excerpt:</p><p></p><p>They were completely fused as one. </p><p></p><p>How powerful of a cultivation and profound of a martial arts understanding would it take to achieve this? Compared to him, the so-called Sword Saint that I am is utterly insignificant.</p><p></p><p>Looking at my close friend, I was so shocked and in awe. Li Liushui smiled.</p><p></p><p>"This is nothing. If you had truly seen the Sword Emperor in action, you would know that the shock and awe is something that cannot be matched in a lifetime."</p><p></p><p>Lu Qingshan clenched his fists slightly, feeling regretful. "It's a pity that my strength is not enough. I'm far from reaching the King Realm expert level. If I could reach that level, perhaps I would have a chance to witness it as well."</p><p></p><p>"No need to dwell on the past, cherish this opportunity well. The battle today is where the true chance lies.</p><p></p><p>If you can comprehend the Sword Dao within, breaking through to the King Realm should not be a big problem."</p><p></p><p>Lu Qingshan nodded, his gaze once again fixed on the ancient figure atop the mountain.</p><p></p><p>The White Tiger spoke in a low voice:</p><p></p><p>"Sister Zhu Que, if those two were to fight seriously, who do you think would most likely emerge victorious?"</p><p></p><p>Zhu Que shook her head. </p><p></p><p>"This is not even a question that needs to be asked. The victor will definitely be the Azure Dragon!"</p><p></p><p>The White Tiger was shocked.</p><p></p><p>"Is the Azure Dragon truly that strong?"</p><p></p><p>Zhu Que smiled.</p><p></p><p>"He is no longer just strong. His martial dao has reached the pinnacle below the Emperor Realm! The reason he cannot break through to the Emperor Realm is precisely because of this.</p><p></p><p>For others to break through the Emperor Realm, they may only need a little bit of comprehension.</p><p></p><p>But for him, he requires an extremely vast comprehension.</p><p></p><p>However, if he were to break through that realm, he would become a true dragon soaring through the nine heavens. Within the Emperor Realm, he would be as if in a realm with no one to restrain him."</p><p></p><p>"Whew!" </p><p></p><p>Hearing this evaluation, the White Tiger couldn't help but feel a chill down his spine.</p><p></p><p>Each generation of the Four Sages inherits the legacy of the previous one, so they don't have a very clear understanding of each other's true strength.</p><p></p><p>The White Tiger only knew that each generation of Sword Emperor Azure Dragon was extremely powerful, terrifyingly so.</p><p></p><p>But he had never imagined that the Azure Dragon would be this strong! To have Sword Goddess Zhu Que give such an assessment.</p><p></p><p>After all, Sword Goddess Zhu Que is the number one existence on the World Phoenix Ranking.</p><p></p><p>The White Tiger had clashed with Zhu Que once before, and while they were only one rank apart, the difference between them was like heaven and earth!</p><p></p><p>For Zhu Que to comment this way, the Azure Dragon's strength is truly unimaginable.</p><p></p><p>"By the way, Sister Zhu Que, have you ever fought against Elder Brother Azure Dragon? You're the number one on the World Phoenix Ranking, and he's the number one on the World Dragon Ranking. </p><p></p><p>You should have fought against Elder Brother Azure Dragon, right? Even if your strength is not his equal, you should have exchanged some moves, right?"</p><p></p><p>This was also a question that the White Tiger had always been very curious about.</p><p></p><p>However, as soon as he finished speaking, Lu Qingshan and Li Liushui also immediately perked up their ears.</p><p></p><p>It was obvious that the two of them were also very curious about this matter.</p><p></p><p>Indeed, they were both top experts among experts, but when it came to the number one on the World Phoenix Ranking, the gap in cultivation from the number one on the Dragon Ranking, their aura of mastery had completely dissipated.</p><p></p><p>What remained was only the raging fire of curiosity.</p><p></p><p>Sword Goddess Zhu Que just smiled slightly.</p><p></p><p>"Of course we've fought before, when two cultivators of similar realms meet, how could they resist not exchanging blows?"</p><p></p><p>"Then how many moves did you last against him?"</p><p></p><p>At this moment, the hearts of the White Tiger, Li Liushui, and Lu Qingshan all started to beat violently.</p><p></p><p>"Half a move!"</p><p></p><p>These two calm words instantly silenced the entire area.</p><p></p><p>The three's minds instantly froze.</p><p></p><p>This shock was simply too overwhelming for them to even add anything!</p><p></p><p>Half a move!</p><p></p><p>Sword Goddess Zhu Que, the number one on the World Phoenix Ranking, was only able to withstand half a move against the Azure Dragon!</p><p></p><p>Was this some kind of joke? Could the Azure Dragon really be so terrifyingly powerful?</p><p></p><p>At this moment, for some reason, the three of them couldn't help but start to envy Ye Xiao.</p><p></p><p>Obtaining the true meaning of the Azure Dragon's martial dao, for Ye Xiao, was no different from gaining the greatest experience package in the world.</p><p></p><p>It would absolutely allow him to break through to the Emperor Realm.</p><p></p><p>Lu Qingshan couldn't help but sneer:</p><p></p><p>"Now even I'm starting to be jealous of that kid. His luck is simply heaven-defying!"</p><p></p><p>Li Liushui laughed wryly.</p><p></p><p>"Ah, people are always jealous of those better off than themselves!"</p><p></p><p>Just then, a figure rapidly flew over from the direction of the Jianghai City.</p><p></p><p>Sensing the aura of the Black Tortoise, everyone's spirits were stirred.</p><p></p><p>"He's here!"</p>

        <h1>Chapter 330</h1>
        <div class="content">
            <p>Here is the full English translation of the Chinese excerpt:</p><p></p><p>Without waiting for the super divine star beasts to react, the third attack had already arrived.</p><p></p><p>But this time, among the many super divine star beasts, six star beasts suddenly acted.</p><p></p><p>Six divine imperial techniques were unleashed, bombarding the sword beam one after another.</p><p></p><p>In the sky, explosions rang out continuously, forming one dazzling light ball after another, like six full moons illuminating the entire Jiuzhou land.</p><p></p><p>These were the six veteran super divine beings taking action! Their combat experience and power were superior to these star beasts who had just stepped into the super divine realm, so by joining forces, they were able to break through this sword beam that surpassed the divine imperial techniques.</p><p></p><p>The sword beam was ultimately detonated by their continuous bombardment, exploding in the air and forming an even larger light ball.</p><p></p><p>This light ball was more powerful than the other six, and in the blink of an eye, it had completely devoured those six star spheres.</p><p></p><p>In their place was an even larger light ball.</p><p></p><p>This light ball was so massive that it even exceeded the light emitted by the moon and stars in the sky above.</p><p></p><p>At this moment, the entire Jiuzhou land was illuminated, as bright as high noon.</p><p></p><p>Such a shocking event directly drew countless people out of their rooms.</p><p></p><p>"What's happening?"</p><p></p><p>"I don't know! Suddenly there was a violent explosion in the sky."</p><p></p><p>"Could it be that those star beasts have attacked?"</p><p></p><p>"Yes, it should be like that. Then Senior Dao Sword Immortal went up and they started fighting. Otherwise, such a powerful explosion ball would not have appeared in midair."</p><p></p><p>"Ah! Senior Dao Sword Immortal is truly pouring his heart and blood for our Jiuzhou human race! I must issue an initiative tomorrow to build a temple for Senior Dao Sword Immortal. He deserves such treatment."</p><p></p><p>"That's right, I'll go sign my name to support it too."</p><p></p><p>The people below did not feel the impact wave from the explosion, thanks to the vast defensive formation set up by the Ancestor Dragon.</p><p></p><p>But for the two Emperor Realm experts in the sky, they were not so fortunate.</p><p></p><p>This impact wave was terrifyingly strong, enough to shock even the Emperor Realm. The super divine star beasts were all forced back several steps.</p><p></p><p>Combined with their own severe injuries, they were unable to withstand the impact and were sent plummeting towards the ground.</p><p></p><p>However, the next moment, a powerful figure caught them.</p><p></p><p>"Senior, are you alright?"</p><p></p><p>Jing Emperor and Yun Emperor looked at the other party and couldn't help but exclaim in surprise, "Blue Dragon, is it really you? I'm not mistaken, right?"</p><p></p><p>Blue Dragon smiled wryly, "Of course it's me."</p><p></p><p>"You've already stepped into the Emperor Realm? When did you reach the Emperor Realm?"</p><p></p><p>Blue Dragon smiled. "I've been quite lucky recently."</p><p></p><p>"Were those two sword beams just now perhaps yours?"</p><p></p><p>Blue Dragon shook his head. "I don't have that kind of ability. The one who struck those two sword beams was someone else."</p><p></p><p>He then looked up at the sky.</p><p></p><p>Jing Emperor and Yun Emperor followed his gaze and looked up at the sky.</p><p></p><p>They saw a very young figure standing among the super divine realm star beasts, hands clasped behind his back, bathed in the moonlight and starlight, looking like an immortal.</p><p></p><p>"Who is he?"</p><p></p><p>The two couldn't help but be stunned, and Blue Dragon smiled faintly, "He is the hope of the Jiuzhou human race! He is the guardian of Jiuzhou!"</p><p></p><p>Hearing these words, Jing Emperor and Yun Emperor couldn't help but be deeply shaken, their pupils constricting.</p><p></p><p>What kind of extraordinary person was that figure, to be praised so highly by Blue Dragon, who had already reached the Emperor Realm?</p><p></p><p>In the sky, the super divine beasts had also noticed Ye Xiao and were instantly alarmed.</p><p></p><p>"His speed is so fast. When did he appear here?"</p><p></p><p>"I don't know, this guy's speed is too fast, I didn't even see him come."</p><p></p><p>The star beasts looked at Ye Xiao with increasing trepidation and fear.</p><p></p><p>They had already realized that the one who had struck those two sword beams was undoubtedly him.</p><p></p><p>At this moment, they seemed to have finally remembered that they had all been to Jiuzhou before. In other words, they were likely familiar with his abilities and knew how formidable he was.</p><p></p><p>"Everyone, don't panic! Don't be afraid. Even if he's strong, he's only one person. Can he really overturn the heavens?"</p><p></p><p>"That's right, we have gathered nearly fifty super divine experts here! How can we be afraid of him?"</p><p></p><p>"Great! Since his strength is so strong, he must have more awakened divine blood within him! As long as we subdue him and devour his fresh blood, our strength will definitely improve further."</p><p></p><p>"Yes! Capture him! Divide and devour!"</p><p>"I want to roast him and eat him!"</p><p>"I want to deep fry him!"</p><p>"I want to eat him raw!"</p><p>"I want his heart!"</p><p>"I want his liver!"</p><p>"I prefer soup."</p><p>"Then I'll have his ears as a side dish!"</p><p></p><p>Ye Xiao did not hear their words. To be precise, at this moment, all his thoughts were focused on the species of these super divine beasts.</p><p></p><p>Here is the full English translation of the Chinese novel excerpt:</p><p></p><p>The eagle, pig, cow, donkey, shark, dragon, sheep, crab, shrimp, fish, and bear - braised carp, braised beef, braised spare ribs, braised lamb chops, braised pork, braised bear paw. Stir-fried pork liver, stir-fried beef tripe, stir-fried shrimp, stir-fried fish cubes. Steamed fish fin, steamed crab, steamed shrimp. Wow, this is going all out for a full Manchu-Han banquet!</p><p></p><p>I was just thinking before, what if these guys escaped? If they didn't come, I would have really missed out.</p><p></p><p>But unexpectedly, they came on their own.</p><p></p><p>Wow! Since that's the case, I can't be blamed.</p><p></p><p>Send them on their way! The super divine beast, even before Ye Xiao made a move, he had already launched the attack.</p><p></p><p>Yin-Yang Escape Art, a divine art-level technique, naturally it would exceed the speed of these divine beasts.</p><p></p><p>Moreover, he had the Emperor Art-level cultivation method - the Nine Revolving Lotus Sutra.</p><p></p><p>There was no need to worry about his endurance at all.</p><p></p><p>"Not good!"</p><p></p><p>Ye Xiao approached the divine beast in front of him, just as he felt a sense of unease, the next moment, Ye Xiao's Shattering Star Fist heavily struck its chest.</p><p></p><p>The astonishing power of the Shattering Star Fist instantly created a deep concave crater in its chest, the powerful fist force piercing through the chest and directly exploding its heart.</p><p></p><p>"Puchi!"</p><p></p><p>The divine beast spat out a mouthful of fresh blood, its eyeballs bulging, blood vessels covering its entire face.</p><p></p><p>Until its dying moment, it still couldn't understand why Ye Xiao was so strong?</p><p></p><p>After dealing with it with a single punch, Ye Xiao directly threw it into his spatial ring.</p><p></p><p>"So fast!"</p><p></p><p>The other divine beasts couldn't help but have their pupils constrict.</p><p></p><p>Ye Xiao's speed was really too fast, and his attacks were too powerful as well. One punch killed a super divine beast, what was his fist made of? How formidable?</p><p></p><p>Just as the divine beasts were hesitating, Ye Xiao struck out two more punches, simultaneously hitting two divine beasts that had just broken through to the super divine realm.</p><p></p><p>The violent fist force directly made the two divine beasts arch their backs.</p><p></p><p>Their internal organs were completely shattered into pieces, and along with the fresh blood, they were spat out from their throats.</p><p></p><p>That terrifying fist force directly blasted the two divine beasts away like cannonballs.</p><p></p><p>The two divine beasts had just turned into streaks of light rushing towards the sky, when Ye Xiao activated the Star Grabbing Hand, and in the next moment, he had pulled their corpses back and stored them in his spatial ring.</p><p></p><p>"Quickly scatter! Don't stand together. This guy's strength is too powerful, he has just stepped into the super divine realm, and you'll be killed by a single punch. Everyone retreat to the side and use attacks to lock him down!</p><p></p><p>The human race's cultivation has always been a bit one-sided, his combat strength is so strong, his defensive ability must not be high, attacking him will be able to disrupt his arrogance."</p><p></p><p>The divine beasts received the order, as if they had found a breakthrough, they immediately retreated, and while retreating, they exerted their full strength to attack, locking Ye Xiao down, so that his powerful agility could not be displayed, and he could not escape their encirclement.</p><p></p><p>But unfortunately, it turned out that their speed was still too slow, even if they wanted to attack Ye Xiao, they could be easily evaded by him.</p><p></p><p>And in the moment of dodging, he had taken the life of another divine beast.</p><p></p><p>The blade light flashed, the opponent's head flew up along with the light, the fresh blood spurting up, forming a beautiful pattern in the air.</p><p></p><p>This unbelievable operation made even the Scenery Emperor and Cloud Emperor couldn't help but have their scalps tingle.</p><p></p><p>Those super divine realm divine beasts who had been chasing and cornering them, at this moment, were completely powerless against Ye Xiao.</p><p></p><p>Not only that, they were even being beaten by Ye Xiao without any ability to fight back.</p><p></p><p>This guy, where did he come from? Why had they never heard of him before?</p><p></p><p>"Damn human! Don't be so arrogant!"</p><p></p><p>Suddenly, one of the divine beasts grabbed Ye Xiao.</p><p></p><p>This was an old-school super divine beast!</p><p></p><p>One of the Twelve Super Divines!</p><p></p><p>The moment he appeared, he firmly locked down Ye Xiao.</p><p></p><p>"Quickly attack him!"</p><p></p><p>Although this would take his own life, he had no choice. </p><p></p><p>Ye Xiao's speed was simply too fast! If it continued like this, they might suffer even more casualties, or even be completely wiped out.</p><p></p><p>This was an unacceptable loss for the divine beasts.</p><p></p><p>So even if he had to sacrifice himself, he must make Ye Xiao perish, otherwise the entire divine beast clan would be ruined! The other divine beasts didn't hesitate and immediately began to attack.</p><p></p><p>The Scenery Emperor and Cloud Emperor couldn't help but become anxious.</p><p></p><p>"Not good! He's in danger. Qinglong, the three of us need to go up and help, we can't let him bear it alone."</p><p></p><p>But Qinglong remained motionless, not only did he not move himself, but he also held down the shoulders of the other two, preventing them from flying up.</p><p></p><p>"Senior predecessors, don't worry. This little matter won't be difficult for him."</p><p></p><p>"Are you talking nonsense? He's being targeted by so many divine beasts, he'll die!"</p>

        <h1>Chapter 80</h1>
        <div class="content">
            <p>Here is the full English translation of the Chinese excerpt:</p><p></p><p>Early the next morning, Ye Xiao packed up the Illusion Jade.</p><p></p><p>From now on, he had to keep the Illusion Jade with him at all times.</p><p></p><p>The day of the Seven Stars Convergence was approaching, and the Illusion Jade could only be suppressed by his spiritual power when it was by his side.</p><p></p><p>Otherwise, there was no guarantee that it wouldn't go out and do something dangerous.</p><p></p><p>After finishing breakfast, he came to the library, clocked in for work, and the other department managers had already started issuing tasks and giving morning briefings, but everything was calm on Ye Xiao's end.</p><p></p><p>He didn't like giving briefings or being high and mighty.</p><p></p><p>Power and authority, if you only use them when you feel like it, that's just you playing with power. </p><p></p><p>If you can't bear to let go of it at any moment, then it's power that's playing with you.</p><p></p><p>Staying calm and peaceful, that's the best way to live.</p><p></p><p>The administrators under Ye Xiao were also very capable. When they arrived, they would proactively mop the floors, wipe the tables, and take care of the basic cleaning, then check if any books were damaged and needed to be replaced.</p><p></p><p>As for Ye Xiao, he would calmly read books, continuing to search for the last foundational cultivation technique in his body refining arts.</p><p></p><p>Before long, a junior administrator came over and couldn't help but ask curiously:</p><p></p><p>"Manager, is Ning Yuhen on leave today? Why hasn't he come?"</p><p></p><p>Ye Xiao was a bit taken aback.</p><p></p><p>"He hasn't come?"</p><p></p><p>"Yes, he hasn't shown up all morning."</p><p></p><p>Ye Xiao raised his brow slightly. This Ning Yuhen was usually very diligent and disciplined at work, so what happened today that he skipped work?</p><p></p><p>"I see, don't mention this to anyone, so his wages won't be deducted."</p><p></p><p>"Okay!"</p><p></p><p>Ye Xiao was good to the people under him. Whenever someone was late or left early, he never recorded it, so his words carried a lot of weight.</p><p></p><p>After the other person left, Ye Xiao immediately activated the Taixuan Tiangong, and in an instant, he found that Ning Yuhen was lying in a daze on his bed in the dormitory, with a slightly elevated body temperature.</p><p></p><p>Could this kid also be affected by the Seven Stars Convergence, with his star beast bloodline activated, causing him to go berserk?</p><p></p><p>He wouldn't go crazy and run out to indiscriminately kill people, would he?</p><p></p><p>With a slight movement of his mind, Ye Xiao activated the Shenyi Jue and instantly appeared outside Ning Yuhen's door.</p><p></p><p>He knocked on the door, and Ning Yuhen's hazy voice came from inside.</p><p></p><p>"Who is it?"</p><p></p><p>"It's me."</p><p></p><p>Hearing Ye Xiao's voice, Ning Yuhen mustered the strength to say, "Come in, the door isn't locked."</p><p></p><p>Ye Xiao pushed open the door, his expression momentarily blank.</p><p></p><p>In that instant, he had sensed a very familiar feeling.</p><p></p><p>However, he quickly regained his composure and walked in.</p><p></p><p>"What's going on? Sleeping in the middle of the day?"</p><p></p><p>Ning Yuhen hugged the blanket, curled up in the bed, shivering.</p><p></p><p>"I don't know, last night when I came back, I felt a bit cold, like I had a fever. But the healing technique I used didn't work."</p><p></p><p>Ye Xiao knew that Ning Yuhen didn't dare go to the hospital, afraid that his star beast bloodline would be discovered.</p><p></p><p>However, his own silver fox bloodline came with a powerful healing technique, not much inferior to the doctors in the hospital.</p><p></p><p>How could he not even be able to cure a simple cold and fever? And combined with that familiar feeling just now.</p><p></p><p>"Maybe your healing technique isn't suitable. I've been studying some other healing techniques recently, let me take a look."</p><p></p><p>Healing techniques were something anyone could cultivate, with low requirements, so Ye Xiao didn't need to worry about revealing anything in front of Ning Yuhen.</p><p></p><p>"Okay! Thank you, Manager."</p><p></p><p>Ye Xiao reached out and placed his hand on Ning Yuhen's wrist.</p><p></p><p>Here is the full English translation of the Chinese excerpt:</p><p></p><p>Yiyi released her healing technique, only to discover that Ning Yuhen's fresh blood was flowing rapidly, as if it had been catalyzed by something. The bloodline of the star beast within him was expanding greatly.</p><p></p><p>Something was not right.</p><p></p><p>This was not because of the Seven-Star Linked Pearls, as Huanliuli was also affected by the Seven-Star Linked Pearls, but the symptoms were showing a stage-by-stage surge.</p><p></p><p>For example, within a minute, her strength would suddenly surge by a portion, but then it would maintain for the next period, only to surge again at the next time.</p><p></p><p>However, Ning Yuhen's star beast bloodline within him was being activated constantly, every moment.</p><p></p><p>Ye Xiao had specifically looked up some books about the Seven-Star Linked Pearls in the morning, which recorded that the influence of the Seven-Star Linked Pearls on demi-beasts and star beasts was the same, and would not produce different effects due to different constitutions.</p><p></p><p>While silently casting the healing technique, Ye Xiao also activated the Taixuan Tiangong to directly scan Ning Yuhen's soul.</p><p></p><p>He found it! In an instant, Ye Xiao found the cause, and then that overwhelming spiritual power surged over.</p><p></p><p>In Ning Yuhen's soul, there was a black mist that had not yet realized its predicament, controlling Ning Yuhen's spiritual power to activate his bloodline.</p><p></p><p>"Hehe, kid, the taste of beastification is not pleasant. But once the beastification succeeds, you will completely evolve from a human into the noble star beast!</p><p></p><p>Thank my majesty for bestowing you with this supreme grace!"</p><p></p><p>But just as the words fell, his consciousness suddenly plunged into a sealed darkness.</p><p></p><p>"???"</p><p></p><p>The black mist had not yet reacted when it felt the surroundings turn dark, instantly being enveloped.</p><p></p><p>After Ye Xiao pulled the black mist out of Ning Yuhen's soul, the boiling beast blood within Ning Yuhen quickly began to subside, with only a slight simmering left, and Ning Yuhen's own healing technique had begun to operate.</p><p></p><p>Ning Yuhen seemed to have been exhausted all night and fell asleep silently.</p><p></p><p>Ye Xiao did not disturb him, and his figure turned, coming to his own dormitory next door.</p><p></p><p>Although he did not live here, he still had his own dormitory reserved.</p><p></p><p>Spreading his palm slightly, a black mist quickly diffused and prepared to flee.</p><p></p><p>Boom, boom, boom...</p><p></p><p>But unfortunately, Ye Xiao had already set up a spiritual power defense, and at this moment, the entire room was enveloped in spiritual power.</p><p></p><p>The black mist collided a few times and then gradually stopped, the entire mass of black mist violently pulsating.</p><p></p><p>"I was careless, I didn't expect this small Jianghai City to have not only excellent martial artists, but also a spiritual power expert."</p><p></p><p>"Are you the King Aer?"</p><p></p><p>Ye Xiao immediately judged the identity of the other party.</p><p>The black mist paused.</p><p></p><p>"Good kid, you even guessed my true identity!"</p><p></p><p>Seeing the other party admit it, Ye Xiao showed no mercy, activating the Taixuan Tiangong to disperse the black mist with a bang!</p><p></p><p>Because it was a spiritual power explosion, only their spiritual sea would feel it, and no one else would be able to hear it.</p><p></p><p>However, the soul body of King Aer soon condensed into form again.</p><p></p><p>"Damn brat, not playing by the rules, you actually sneak attacked me when I wasn't paying attention! Bullying me when I have no..."</p><p></p><p>Before he could finish speaking, Ye Xiao launched an even stronger spiritual power attack.</p><p></p><p>"Intruders must die!"</p>

        <div class="content">
            <p>Here is the full English translation of the Chinese excerpt:</p><p></p><p>In Ye Xiao's underground cellar, after a day and a night of refinement, he finally obtained another advancement.</p><p></p><p>Boom!</p><p></p><p>The power and vital energy within his body had risen to another great level.</p><p></p><p>This also signified that Ye Xiao had successfully stepped into the Slay God Realm's sixth layer! Ye Xiao couldn't help but slightly raise the corners of his mouth.</p><p></p><p>Done, he had advanced to another small realm.</p><p></p><p>This month, he should have only advanced one small realm, but now he had already advanced two small realms.</p><p></p><p>It was all thanks to the offerings from those God Kings, providing him with so much divine blood, allowing him to advance so quickly.</p><p></p><p>It's just a pity that there aren't many of these newly revived God Kings who are weak and easy to capture, which is a great regret.</p><p></p><p>If he could get a few more, his cultivation would soar to the heavens! For the upcoming days, he could only rely on the ancient treasured techniques within the Golden Book Spiritual Consciousness, combined with the blood and flesh of the Star Beasts, to slowly cultivate.</p><p></p><p>It's estimated that the next breakthrough would have to wait until a month later.</p><p></p><p>Currently, there are still three small realms left before breaking through to the God King Realm. Once he crosses those last three small realms, that will be the time of his breakthrough into the God King Realm.</p><p></p><p>The God King is almost here, will the God Emperor be far behind!? Sensing Ye Xiao's cultivation advancement, the group of Star Beasts all came forward and said, "Congratulations, Master, on your breakthrough again. Master's natural talent is unparalleled in all ages."</p><p></p><p>Subsequently, there was another wave of flattery and gifts.</p><p></p><p>To this, Ye Xiao merely nodded his head.</p><p></p><p>This time, he wasn't as happy as before.</p><p></p><p>As his cultivation continued to rise, the amount of blood energy they could provide him with became less and less.</p><p></p><p>How to arrange them next became a big problem.</p><p></p><p>Should he send them to excavate the divine crystals outside the God Nation's treasury?</p><p></p><p>After all, even if the passageway is dug through, the other divine crystals still need to be collected and taken away.</p><p></p><p>But Ye Xiao felt that he didn't really need them that much.</p><p></p><p>Excavating divine crystals relies not on individual strength, but on overall numbers.</p><p></p><p>These few Star Beasts, although they have reached the Sovereign Beast level, their cultivation would not bring about a rapid excavation progress.</p><p></p><p>As for refining elixirs, it would be a waste to use these Sovereign Beast-level Star Beasts.</p><p></p><p>Having them breed new Star Beasts to increase the Star Beast army's numbers? That also doesn't seem feasible.</p><p></p><p>The breeding ability of high-level Star Beasts is already very low, relying on them to birth a large Star Beast army is simply a pipe dream!</p><p></p><p>Oh right, speaking of which, the previous Star Beasts should still be scattered out there. If he could capture them, wouldn't that be able to accelerate the excavation of divine crystals? Maybe in that case, these few Sovereign Beasts would have a use.</p><p></p><p>Thinking about this, Ye Xiao collected all the resources they provided, then smiled slightly and said:</p><p></p><p>"From today onwards, you no longer need to continue providing me with blood and flesh."</p><p></p><p>The Star Beasts' hearts sank.</p><p></p><p>What did this mean? Had the master no longer needed them?</p><p></p><p>Indeed, as Ye Xiao's cultivation continued to rise higher, their value became lower and lower, until now, they had no value at all.</p><p></p><p>"Master, you're not really going to kill us, are you?"</p><p></p><p>Ye Xiao shook his head.</p><p></p><p>"Of course not, you are at least Sovereign Beast-level Star Beasts, I'm not going to kill you like that.</p><p></p><p>However, that depends on your utilization value.</p><p></p><p>If your utilization value is not enough, and you have no use to me, I don't want to waste food on you."</p><p></p><p>The Star Beasts hurriedly nodded.</p><p></p><p>"Please instruct us, Master, we will definitely do our utmost to serve you."</p><p></p><p>Ye Xiao nodded.</p><p></p><p>"Then from now on, you will go out and capture Star Beasts, the more you capture, the better. I will reward you based on how many Star Beasts you capture.</p><p></p><p>The more you capture, the more generous the reward."</p><p></p><p>The Star Beasts' eyes lit up, there's actually a reward? </p><p></p><p>This is too good to be true!</p><p></p><p>"Rest assured, Master, we will definitely do our utmost to capture more Star Beasts."</p><p></p><p>"Then go."</p><p></p><p>Ye Xiao imprinted a spiritual brand on them, not afraid that they would flee, then let them go out to capture Star Beasts and return to mine.</p><p></p><p>If they are discovered by powerful experts and their memories are about to be searched, the spiritual brand will be triggered, directly detonating their souls.</p><p></p><p>In this way, he can avoid being discovered by others.</p><p></p><p>After the Star Beasts left, Ye Xiao continued his peaceful cultivation.</p><p></p><p>He heard from his colleagues in the library that the various tribal alliances in the Star Realm had already summoned their own tribesmen, and some God Clans had even completely uprooted from their God Clan territories and come to the Canglan Star Realm.</p><p></p><p>This was unavoidable, for those small God Clans, they simply didn't have enough powerful experts to guard two places at once.</p><p></p><p>If they were fighting over the God Tomb here, while their homeland was being robbed, even anyone would be unable to accept that.</p><p></p><p>However, this also brought a lot of pressure to the XuanYuan God Clan.</p><p></p><p>It is said that there have been many battles in the Star Realm recently, and some very powerful God Clans have occupied many of the XuanYuan God Clan's outposts.</p><p></p><p>This was indeed a considerable blow to the XuanYuan God Clan.</p><p></p><p>This was all within Ye Xiao's expectations.</p><p></p><p>With the exposure of information about the Ancient God Nation, those small God Clans ranked lower in the Star Realm would attack the XuanYuan God Clan like hungry rabid dogs, fighting for their lives.</p><p></p><p>Although the XuanYuan God Clan is large and powerful, it is precisely because of this that they cannot send all their powerful experts over like the others.</p><p></p><p>The Xuanyuan God Clan has an abundance of resources in the star domain they currently reside in.</p><p></p><p>That is far more than the resources they can obtain by excavating the God Tombs in the Canglan Star Realm! Other families are all eyeing it greedily.</p><p></p><p>Here is the full English translation of the Chinese excerpt:</p><p></p><p>If a large number of experts are transferred over, causing the resources of those mineral veins to be lost, that would be like losing a watermelon and picking up a sesame seed.</p><p></p><p>This is also one of the more troubling problems facing the Xuanyuan Clan right now.</p><p></p><p>The only solution the Xuanyuan Clan has at the moment may be to offer concessions and ally with some stronger families under the starry sky.</p><p></p><p>Among these families, some may not think highly of the Ancient Divine Kingdom and may not necessarily come over.</p><p></p><p>There are also those who may harbor the same intentions as the Xuanyuan Clan, wanting to seize some good resources as well.</p><p></p><p>So whether they can be recruited and what kind of price would have to be paid is uncertain.</p><p></p><p>But these are not things that Ye Xiao needs to consider.</p><p></p><p>His current tasks are only two.</p><p></p><p>One is to excavate the divine treasury of the Ancient Divine Kingdom.</p><p></p><p>The other is to continue learning new divine arts in the library and fuse them into new divine techniques.</p><p></p><p>Although he doesn't know how many divine techniques he can fuse, each one is incredibly powerful, not only able to enhance Ye Xiao's cultivation speed, but also a means for him to protect his life.</p><p></p><p>A few days later, Ye Xiao found another divine art in the library, a nine-star spiritual divine art - One Thought, Flower Blooms.</p><p></p><p>With this, the nine-star spiritual divine arts have now reached two in number.</p><p></p><p>Spiritual cultivation methods are unique, and Ye Xiao originally thought that it would independently synthesize a brand new Ancient divine technique, but unfortunately, it did not.</p><p></p><p>It seems that in order for spiritual cultivation methods to synthesize an Ancient divine technique, they still need to be fused with other cultivation methods.</p><p></p><p>It's just that he doesn't know what that method might be.</p><p></p><p>Ye Xiao vaguely feels that it may be the Spoken Command, because this thing and the spiritual cultivation methods have some similarities, both involving the power of certain rules.</p><p></p><p>Aside from the Spoken Command, the other options would either be combat-type body cultivation methods or a toxic cultivation method.</p><p></p><p>Spiritual cultivation methods could hardly be blended with those.</p><p></p><p>It seems that the next step is to obtain two Spoken Command divine arts.</p><p></p><p>On a certain star island in the starry sky, Emperor Jing and the others were diligently excavating a divine tomb.</p><p></p><p>"Hurry up! Quicken the pace, there are already signs of battle in the vicinity, there must be people from other divine clans attacking.</p><p></p><p>If we don't speed up, by the time they get here, we'll have a tough fight on our hands!"</p><p></p><p>Emperor Jing commanded the group to work harder.</p><p></p><p>But just then, a group of figures quickly approached, like a dark cloud.</p><p></p><p>"Hahaha, to think there would be a group of Xuanyuan Clan members here, and with so many people, this star island must have quite a few divine tombs, right?"</p><p></p><p>"Kill them all! Seize all the resources here."</p><p></p><p>Before anyone knew it, a voice gave the order, and beams of divine arts attacks like lightning bolts quickly rained down on the ground.</p><p></p><p>Boom, boom, boom, accompanied by violent explosions, several Xuanyuan Clan members were instantly blasted to death.</p><p></p><p>Emperor Jing and the others hid in a tomb, evading the first round of bombardment.</p><p></p><p>"Didn't expect the enemy to arrive so quickly. After their first round of bombardment, they'll probably come to the ground for a life-and-death battle with us directly.</p><p></p><p>Everyone be careful! The enemy is too strong, we can't fight them head-on, find an opportunity and flee immediately."</p><p></p><p>"Yes!"</p><p></p><p>"Also, be careful with the weapons in your hands, don't let them fall into the enemy's hands. These are all top-grade weapons that Ye Xiao was reluctant to use himself. He gave us such good weapons, we must protect them well.</p><p></p><p>If it really comes to an unavoidable situation, even if we have to detonate them directly, we can't let the enemy benefit, understand?"</p><p></p><p>"Yes!"</p><p></p><p>As soon as Emperor Jing finished speaking, dozens of figures quickly descended from the sky, their attire uniform, all in pure white with black trim.</p><p></p><p>"Brothers, kill them! Don't leave a single one alive."</p><p></p><p>This divine clan team charged towards the Xuanyuan Clan disciples, and when they scattered, Emperor Jing let out a loud shout.</p><p></p><p>"Charge!"</p><p></p><p>As soon as the words left his mouth, in the blink of an eye, the group from the divine tomb all rushed out in a swarm.</p><p></p><p>"Kill!"</p><p></p><p>The enemy quickly noticed them.</p><p></p><p>"Didn't expect there to be a group of people hiding here, don't let any of them go, take care of them all."</p><p></p><p>The enemy's strength was clearly superior to Emperor Jing's group! </p><p></p><p>From the aura, it could be judged that they were mostly at the Emperor Realm and above, close to ten dragons.</p><p></p><p>Emperor Jing charged out in the lead, engaging in battle with an Emperor Realm expert two dragons stronger than himself.</p><p></p><p>His expression was very serious, unsure if he could lead the group to break through.</p><p></p><p>But he had no choice.</p><p></p><p>He reckoned that with the divine weapon Ye Xiao had given him, the sharpness should be able to make up for the gap in strength between him and the opponent, allowing him to fight the other.</p><p></p><p>The distance between the two closed in an instant.</p><p></p><p>Emperor Jing exerted all his strength, swinging the divine weapon in his hand, colliding with the opponent's weapon.</p><p></p><p>A sword beam flashed, directly slashing through the opponent's weapon, armor, and body in a devastating manner!</p><p></p><p>One sword, instant kill!</p><p></p><p>Emperor Jing was stunned.</p><p></p><p>What just happened? He had just killed in one sword strike an existence stronger than himself? 3000 words, 9000.</p><p></p><p>Seeking recommendations, seeking monthly votes.</p><p></p><p>Thank you to the readers "Listening to the Wind Singing of the Old" and "Book Friend 20200327144012742" for the donations, greatly appreciated!</p><p></p><p>(This chapter is complete)</p>

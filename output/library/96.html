        <h1>Chapter 96</h1>
        <div class="content">
            <p>Here is the full English translation of the Chinese excerpt:</p><p></p><p>With the previous salary and savings, Ye Xiao now has over 100,000 yuan.</p><p></p><p>However, money doesn't hold much significance for Ye Xiao at the moment.</p><p></p><p>It's just enough for him to buy some better food.</p><p></p><p>This peaceful life went on for about a month.</p><p></p><p>Until one morning...</p><p></p><p>"Shocking big news, my friends!"</p><p></p><p>That morning, as soon as Ye Xiao came to the upper level to read books, he heard a reader exclaim in surprise.</p><p></p><p>Generally, the library is required to maintain a quiet environment, and there are rarely people making loud noises.</p><p></p><p>But this person's words successfully attracted the curiosity of the crowd.</p><p></p><p>So no one scolded him.</p><p></p><p>"The genius from Han State, Park Jian-sheng, has been defeated!"</p><p></p><p>The crowd couldn't help but exclaim in surprise:</p><p></p><p>"Park Jian-sheng has been defeated?"</p><p></p><p>"How is that possible? I've seen his sword techniques, such profound sword mastery, how could he be defeated?"</p><p></p><p>"It's not unusual for him to be defeated. The reason he was able to sweep through Jing State before was that the martial arts heritage in Jing State had been somewhat interrupted in recent years, and some top experts had fallen in the fight against the Star Beasts.</p><p></p><p>In fact, there are quite a few reclusive experts in our Nine States who have trained some geniuses. They just haven't come out of seclusion."</p><p></p><p>"Yes, I've heard that in our Nine States, there are a total of seventeen top-tier masters who have entered the Dragon and Phoenix Rankings. Two of them reportedly accepted disciples about twenty years ago."</p><p></p><p>"You're talking about Sword Saint Lu Qingshan and Sword God Li Liushui, right?"</p><p></p><p>"That's right, these two are Saint Realm experts known throughout the Nine States. It should be their disciples who defeated Park Jian-sheng."</p><p></p><p>However, the one who spoke first shook his head.</p><p></p><p>"No, it's not them. It's the disciple of the Iga Ninja Sword style from Ying State - Sasaki Taro."</p><p></p><p>"It's actually a disciple of the Iga Ninja Sword style! I heard this guy also wants to emulate Park Jian-sheng and challenge the martial arts world of the Central State, as a young swordsman."</p><p></p><p>"Yes, he was taught by the top Iga Ninja Sword master in Ying State - Murakami Yoshi. Everyone knows that Murakami Yoshi is the top swordsman in Ying State and is ranked 50th in the Dragon Rankings, three places lower than Park Jian-sheng's master, Liu Chengxun.</p><p></p><p>Defeating Park Jian-sheng is to humiliate Han State, and he will use this as a starting point to challenge the young swordsmen of the Central State. The first stop is Qin Yuyan from our Jianghai City."</p><p></p><p>"Damn it! He's starting with our Jianghai City? Then this is going to be disastrous.</p><p></p><p>The Iga Ninja Sword style combines sword techniques and Ying State ninjutsu, known for being treacherous, bizarre, malicious, and ruthless, making it almost undefeatable.</p><p></p><p>There's a story online that illustrates the terror of the Iga Ninja Sword style:</p><p>'The Ghost Sword is invisible, the footwork is elusive, turn around and strike, one slash seals the throat.'</p><p></p><p>Last time, Qin Yuyan was defeated by Park Jian-sheng, and now that Park Jian-sheng has been defeated by Sasaki Taro, Qin Yuyan is definitely going to lose again."</p><p></p><p>"I heard today is the day of the showdown, but it's a pity there's no live broadcast. We're still in the library, and by the time we get there, it might be too late. We can only wait for someone to post a video online later!"</p><p></p><p>The crowd sighed with dismay. Ye Xiao, sitting on the side reading a book, was not particularly concerned.</p><p></p><p>As he read books every day, he naturally had some understanding of these public matters.</p><p></p><p>The Iga Ninja Sword style, commonly known as the "Ghost Sword", combines the fast sword and illusory sword techniques, and has evolved them to the extreme. When wielded, it gives a sense of treachery and bizarreness. In reality, it's just a combination of speed and feints. The name is intimidating, but it is not invincible against true sword techniques.</p><p></p><p>Here is the full English translation of the Chinese excerpt:</p><p></p><p>Superb.</p><p></p><p>The sword intent that Qin Yuyan had comprehended contained the domineering sword intent, condensing the most fundamental sword techniques of the Seven Gates, which could be said to be the essence of sword techniques, evolving into the supreme! Therefore, from this perspective, the Iga school's sword techniques have absolutely no chance of defeating the domineering sword.</p><p></p><p>Even Bak Seon-saeng's sword techniques would absolutely not be able to defeat the domineering sword.</p><p></p><p>The key reason why Qin Yuyan was previously defeated by Bak Seon-saeng was that Qin Yuyan had only cultivated for a little over a month at the time. It was absolutely impossible for her to have absorbed too much sword intent.</p><p></p><p>As for now, Sasaki Taro, I'm afraid he won't be that lucky.</p><p></p><p>So Ye Xiao didn't really care, and continued to focus on his own forging techniques.</p><p></p><p>On the other side, in the Jianghai City Martial Arts Academy, the showdown had also begun.</p><p></p><p>The atmosphere on the scene was extremely solemn, with important figures in the city such as Du Changfeng, Qin Shenglong, Du Tianyu, and Ouyang Yunzhong all present.</p><p></p><p>Du Changfeng looked at the arrogant Sasaki Taro standing on the field, his expression very grave.</p><p></p><p>"Unexpectedly, Bak Seon-saeng hasn't left yet, and now Sasaki Taro has come. This little place of Jianghai City is really going to become famous."</p><p></p><p>Qin Shenglong sighed softly.</p><p></p><p>"Who knows? It's a pity that those truly powerful experts are all in seclusion and not coming out.</p><p></p><p>If the sword saints and sword gods of my Jiuzhou were to send their disciples to battle, they would never allow such riffraff to run rampant here."</p><p></p><p>Ouyang Yunzhong smiled and said:</p><p></p><p>"That's why they are called peerless experts, right? Peerless experts are always focused on the martial dao and never interfere with worldly affairs."</p><p></p><p>Du Tianyu couldn't help but speak up:</p><p></p><p>"If only the senior experts of our Jianghai City could teach and guide a couple of disciples, they would surely be able to cultivate two powerhouses."</p><p></p><p>Everyone fell into silent contemplation.</p><p></p><p>The senior experts of Jianghai City have not left a single clue so far.</p><p></p><p>If only they could be found.</p><p></p><p>The overall strength of Jianghai City would be raised to a terrifying level.</p><p></p><p>Alas, they are nowhere to be found.</p><p></p><p>Those senior experts are truly hidden away, their whereabouts unknown.</p><p></p><p>Before long, Qin Yuyan entered the arena, and the disciples of the Jianghai City Martial Arts Academy began to cheer for her.</p><p></p><p>Everyone also turned their attention back to the field.</p><p></p><p>"Judging from Yuyan's footwork, her cultivation has improved quite a bit!"</p><p></p><p>Du Changfeng couldn't help but express his admiration, while Qin Shenglong smiled proudly.</p><p></p><p>"She has already broken through to the Postcelestial Eighth Realm, and is only one step away from the Postcelestial Ninth Realm."</p><p></p><p>"So fast? It seems that sword intent has given her a significant boost. Good, this girl has a promising future to become a true master. And at her current age, she has already surpassed Shenglong's Innate First Realm, which is no small feat."</p><p></p><p>Hearing this evaluation, many of the surrounding students couldn't help but express their admiration.</p><p></p><p>A true master! That is a dream that many aspire to, yet can hardly attain.</p><p></p><p>Bak Seon-saeng was also in the crowd, and a student next to him couldn't help but ask:</p><p></p><p>"Bak Seon-saeng, do you think Qin Yuyan can win?"</p><p></p><p>Bak Seon-saeng shook his head, his expression grave as he said:</p><p></p><p>"It will be difficult. Although her sword techniques are impressive, her cultivation time is still very short.</p><p></p><p>While Sasaki Taro has been cultivating sword techniques for a full twenty-three years!"</p><p></p><p>This is the second update, thank you to the reader Qiu Mo Fa for the donation, greatly appreciated.</p><p></p><p>(This chapter is complete)</p>

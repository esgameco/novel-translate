        <h1>Chapter 117</h1>
        <div class="content">
            <p>Here is the full English translation of the Chinese excerpt:</p><p></p><p>Cat Xu laughed as he explained, "A one cubic meter storage ring, if we just look at its practical use, is not much stronger than a master-level weapon.</p><p></p><p>But the problem is, it also has some additional attributes, like face value."</p><p></p><p>Ye Xiao was momentarily at a loss for words.</p><p></p><p>He had almost forgotten that the biggest feature of the storage ring, aside from being able to store things, is that it is very rare.</p><p></p><p>As the saying goes, the rarer something is, the more valuable it is.</p><p></p><p>Because of this, it has been imbued with the attributes of a luxury item.</p><p></p><p>Of course, luxury items cannot be calculated by normal logic.</p><p></p><p>At the end of the day, Ye Xiao was just too poor. In his two lifetimes, he had never truly been rich, casually spending tens of millions or hundreds of millions to buy something that far exceeds its actual value, which goes against Ye Xiao's consumption concept.</p><p></p><p>This is why Ye Xiao didn't realize why the storage ring was so expensive.</p><p></p><p>"I see, I understand now."</p><p></p><p>At this time, the bidders at the auction were becoming increasingly frenzied, the price rising higher and higher, and in the blink of an eye, it had exceeded 150 million, and there was no sign of it stopping.</p><p></p><p>Xu Da Mao felt a bit embarrassed seeing Ye Xiao waiting, so he spoke up:</p><p></p><p>"What do you want to buy? Let me quickly get it for you."</p><p></p><p>"Black obsidian, iron essence, sticky yellow mud. One hundred jin of each."</p><p></p><p>"Okay!"</p><p></p><p>Xu Da Mao rolled up his sleeves and rushed out to bring Ye Xiao three bags of materials.</p><p></p><p>"I didn't weigh it carefully, but it's definitely more than one hundred jin. Just pay based on the one hundred jin price. The price list is on the wall, you can calculate the price yourself."</p><p></p><p>With that, she ran back to the computer to watch the live broadcast.</p><p></p><p>Ye Xiao smiled helplessly, glanced at the unit price list on the wall, paid the money, and left with three bags of materials.</p><p></p><p>In the world of martial artists, this is quite convenient - casually carrying a few hundred jin of things, without any effort.</p><p></p><p>Unlike the people of the previous Earth, who would have to rest after carrying a bag of rice up a few floors.</p><p></p><p>When he returned home in the evening, Ye Xiao immediately began forging the ring.</p><p></p><p>He planned to make a ring-like object, not too conspicuous.</p><p></p><p>He first selected from all the black obsidian the one with the purest, most translucent black color.</p><p></p><p>Low-key is important, but it can't lack beauty, after all, Ye Xiao is just over twenty years old, still a young man.</p><p></p><p>Then, using spiritual energy transformed into a sword, he carved and polished the black obsidian into a ring shape, and then displayed his divine craftsmanship to begin the forging.</p><p></p><p>First, he fused the properties of the black sand gold, iron essence, and yellow sticky mud to form the foundation of the storage ring.</p><p></p><p>Then, he extracted the faint spatial power from all the other black obsidian, and infused it all into this ring.</p><p></p><p>As the spatial power was continuously infused, the color of this black obsidian became purer and purer, while the other black obsidian turned into ordinary rocks without any special qualities.</p><p></p><p>After Ye Xiao had absorbed all the spatial power from the black obsidian, he directly shaped it according to his own will into a pure rectangular spatial dimension.</p><p></p><p>In this way, it gained the special ability to store things.</p><p></p><p>The jade cat lying on the roof top fell into deep turmoil at this sight.</p><p></p><p>This guy Ye Xiao, how can he even forge a spatial storage ring? He can even control spatial power?</p><p></p><p>Blade techniques, sword techniques, body techniques, body refining, mind techniques, spiritual power, healing abilities, and now he's added forging and alchemy.</p><p></p><p>What can't he do?</p><p></p><p>How does it feel that in just four hundred years, I really can't surpass Ye Xiao? Do I need to add fifty more years? No, fifty years probably won't work, his methods are getting deeper and deeper, simply unfathomable.</p><p></p><p>I'll have to add a hundred years! </p><p></p><p>Yes! Five hundred years! In five hundred years, I'll definitely be able to surpass him.</p><p></p><p>Here is the full English translation of the Chinese excerpt:</p><p></p><p>Ye Xiao became a supreme master of the star beasts, a peak expert. To reach the pinnacle where none could surpass him, he had to attain the realm where even the Liuli (a type of crystal) would become meaningless.</p><p></p><p>It was decided, tonight he would go to the cellar and secretly eat some of the black-scaled snake's meat.</p><p></p><p>Previously, after eating the black-scaled snake's meat, his blood qi had surged, wanting to break through to the Grandmaster's third realm. Eating some more would surely allow him to smoothly break through.</p><p></p><p>After refining the ring, Ye Xiao tried it on, finding it quite good-looking.</p><p></p><p>Then, he immersed his mind in the ring, entering the space within. He couldn't help but exclaim in surprise:</p><p></p><p>"It's so big!"</p><p></p><p>Previously, he had only shaped the spatial force, not knowing the corresponding numerical value of the spatial force that could form such a large space.</p><p></p><p>Now it seems, this storage space formed by the black obsidian was at least as big as a three-story villa.</p><p></p><p>Compared to the immortal cultivation novels where they casually receive a storage ring that can hold a mountain, this was certainly not as impressive. But for Ye Xiao, it was more than enough.</p><p></p><p>Furthermore, he could continue to absorb the spatial force from other black obsidian, continuously enhancing it.</p><p></p><p>The spatial ring he had sold at the auction before was estimated to be worth two or three hundred million. His current spatial ring, being so large, was likely worth over a hundred billion, perhaps even approaching a trillion.</p><p></p><p>Because spatial rings were inherently rare, and large spatial rings were even rarer. </p><p></p><p>Large spatial rings were no longer just a luxury item, but had true practical value.</p><p></p><p>For example, large-scale cargo transportation, transporting cultivators, and so on.</p><p></p><p>Of course, Ye Xiao wouldn't sell this one.</p><p></p><p>As the saying goes, "An honest man is guilty of possessing jade." Once news of this excellent spatial ring spread out, it would attract the envy of many powerful experts, not just for monetary reasons.</p><p></p><p>Even if he could defeat a Celestial Sect Master of the Seventh Rank, a peak expert of the Celestial Sect Master of the Ninth Rank? </p><p></p><p>Furthermore, his identity would certainly be exposed, and he would be under the scrutiny of the entire world, feeling uncomfortable even going to the restroom.</p><p></p><p>Overall, the harvest was still very substantial. With this ring, he no longer had to worry about storing star beast meat or other materials being discovered by others.</p><p></p><p>Next, he would find time to study formations, and engrave them into the ring, adding encryption and defensive protections.</p><p></p><p>Speaking of which, the underground cellar he had dug should also be leveled, to prevent it from being discovered by anyone in the future.</p><p></p><p>Thinking of this, he glanced at the Illusion Liuli on the roof. The Illusion Liuli was lying on the roof, drooling and looking dazed, occasionally twitching in a silly laugh.</p><p></p><p>This made Ye Xiao speechless. How could such a beautiful girl always give off an idiotic impression?</p><p></p><p>"Hey, are you done daydreaming?"</p><p></p><p>Ye Xiao called out, and the silly smile on the Illusion Liuli's face abruptly stopped. She wiped the drool from the corner of her mouth and leapt down.</p><p></p><p>"Master, what's the matter?"</p><p></p><p>"Go, level the cellar below."</p><p></p><p>The Illusion Liuli's eyes lit up. Great, just what she was thinking about.</p><p></p><p>The cellar had black-scaled snake meat, and she could go work and sneak a bite.</p><p></p><p>"Don't worry, Master, I'll complete the task!"</p><p></p><p>With that, the Illusion Liuli quickly rushed into the cellar.</p><p></p><p>However, when she arrived in the dark cellar, the cat was instantly dumbfounded.</p><p></p><p>Where was the black-scaled snake meat?</p><p></p><p>(This chapter ends)</p>

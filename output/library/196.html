        <h1>Chapter 196</h1>
        <div class="content">
            <p>Here is the full English translation of the Chinese excerpt:</p><p></p><p>Ordinary flowers definitely won't do. Ye Xiao wants good-tasting honey that can provide a huge amount of spiritual energy to help him break through, not just regular honey.</p><p></p><p>It's like meeting online friends - you can't just meet for the sake of meeting, that would be vulgar. It has to be for the sake of spiritual elevation.</p><p></p><p>The first flower he decided on was called the Purple Yaolan. This is a flower that blooms at night, and unlike other flowers, it absorbs moonlight instead of sunlight, condensing the essence of heaven and earth. It has a kind of strange, zombie-like feeling to it.</p><p></p><p>What's so good about this flower? Because it blooms in the early morning, when most people are resting, and the spiritual energy in heaven and earth is at its fullest.</p><p></p><p>So the spiritual energy it condenses is extremely rich.</p><p></p><p>There are also not a few cultivators who grow this flower at home, both as an ornamental and to absorb spiritual energy.</p><p></p><p>Another important reason Ye Xiao chose it is that it's easy to obtain, with abundant supply.</p><p></p><p>There's also the Blazing Sun Flower, whose nature is the opposite of the Purple Yaolan - it loves the sun instead of the moon.</p><p></p><p>Its existence is more common, and while its effects aren't as good as the Purple Yaolan's, its abundance and affordability make up for it.</p><p></p><p>Besides these two, there are also the Linglong Flower, the Flower King - Myriad Purple and Red Leaves, and the Climbing Stone Flower.</p><p></p><p>They are all flowers with extremely rich spiritual energy, and some are even auctioned off, used as top-grade medicinal materials for refining supreme elixirs!</p><p></p><p>But Ye Xiao reckons those last few types won't be easy to obtain.</p><p></p><p>Ye Xiao called up Wang Dalong, the night market stall owner.</p><p></p><p>This guy has connections, and if there's something hard to find, he can usually get it.</p><p></p><p>"Hello, President Ye, why did you suddenly call me? Do you have a task for me?"</p><p></p><p>"I want to buy a few types of flowers."</p><p></p><p>"Flowers? Are they for elixir refining?"</p><p></p><p>"Yes."</p><p></p><p>"Okay, what flowers do you want?"</p><p></p><p>Ye Xiao listed the flowers he wanted, and Wang Dalong explained:</p><p></p><p>"President Ye, I can get you the Purple Yaolan and Blazing Sun Flower, but the others will be hard. They're top-grade goods, and the prices are high, tens of thousands per flower, even over a hundred thousand. Buying those flowers to refine elixirs isn't really suitable.</p><p></p><p>What if it fails? That would be a huge loss."</p><p></p><p>"Where can I buy the other flowers more cheaply?"</p><p></p><p>"Cheap is impossible. Unless you go pick them in the mountains yourself. If I remember correctly, you can find them in the Southwest Forest Sea, but it's extremely dangerous there, with powerful star beasts lurking. If you're not careful, you could lose your life."</p><p></p><p>"Is that so? I see. Then just get me 200,000 worth of the Purple Yaolan and Blazing Sun Flower first."</p><p></p><p>Ye Xiao had previously sold Jifeng's fur for several million in the Hucheng black market, so he didn't need to worry about money now.</p><p></p><p>"Okay, I'll have it ready for you by tonight."</p><p></p><p>"Await your good news."</p><p></p><p>After hanging up, Ye Xiao started planning.</p><p></p><p>First, he'll try the effects of the Purple Yaolan and Blazing Sun Flower, see what level they can reach.</p><p></p><p>If the honey is excellent and has immense spiritual energy, he'll then go to the Forest Sea to look for other flower varieties.</p><p></p><p>If the honey is poor and lacks spiritual energy, he'll just get rid of Su Shan and fry her up in breadcrumbs.</p><p></p><p>Ye Xiao won't keep useless things - if they can't provide value, even an eighth-grade star beast is worthless to him.</p><p></p><p>That night, Wang Dalong prepared the two flowers as promised, two truckloads of each.</p><p></p><p>Ye Xiao paid the money and threw the flowers into his spatial seal, letting Su Shan start making the honey, then went home to rest.</p><p></p><p>The next morning, he personally went to the cultivation farm to collect the results, not letting Xuanliuli come.</p><p></p><p>He wanted to see how yesterday's efforts had turned out.</p><p></p><p>When Ye Xiao arrived, all the star beasts had their daily offerings ready.</p><p></p><p>Noel Fis's octopus tentacles, Elder Xian's ginseng threads, deer blood, deer antlers, chicken eggs, turtle eggs...</p><p></p><p>But what Ye Xiao valued most were the offerings from Su Shan and Moyu, the two eighth-grade star beasts.</p><p></p><p>Moyu had just finished and was buttoning up.</p><p></p><p>This left Ye Xiao very puzzled.</p><p></p><p>Does she not even need to transform back into a star beast form? Is she really that powerful?</p><p></p><p>The fresh milk was still steaming.</p><p></p><p>Ye Xiao flicked his finger with spiritual energy to take out a bit, and the taste was very good - warm, slightly sweet, very appetizing.</p><p></p><p>An extremely rich but gentle spiritual energy spread from his stomach to his limbs.</p><p></p><p>Wow, jackpot!</p><p></p><p>The effect of just a sip is almost like eating a supreme-grade elixir pill. Drinking a whole bucket would be worth several master-grade elixir pills at least.</p><p></p><p>And it can also be used to make cheese, butter, peach yogurt, and so on.</p><p></p><p>Both in actual effects and in taste, it's far superior to elixir refining.</p><p></p><p>Most importantly, elixir refining requires buying materials, which is costly and troublesome. This is much simpler - all he has to do is come over every day, and...</p><p></p><p>Here is the full English translation of the Chinese excerpt:</p><p></p><p>"Just take it away. It's perfect.</p><p></p><p>The Susan who was reckless just yesterday has now become the most diligent little bee. After a night's work, she has produced a full eight small buckets.</p><p></p><p>This doesn't mean she is a god-level bee and can collect honey quickly.</p><p></p><p>Of course, she can also use a faster method to collect honey, but in that case, the perfection of the honey produced would be far from enough.</p><p></p><p>The spiritual energy content and taste would be lacking.</p><p></p><p>Susan personally dislikes Ye Xiao, but she is not a fool.</p><p></p><p>She knows that right now, going against him is courting death, so rather than doing that, it's better to be obedient for a while.</p><p></p><p>In Noel Fei's words, maybe one day they'll be rescued, but if they die here, that would be a waste.</p><p></p><p>Ye Xiao used spiritual energy to dig out a bit to taste, and wow, it's not at all weaker than the fresh milk created by Mo Yu.</p><p></p><p>You know, Mo Yu used blood qi along with spiritual energy to create it, while Susan's honey collection didn't sacrifice her own blood qi.</p><p></p><p>In this way, she is much stronger than the other star beasts.</p><p></p><p>And there is so much honey here, much more than the milk, which is equivalent to providing herself with dozens of grandmaster-level elixirs at once! Decided, from now on, let her do more work and get more flowers.</p><p></p><p>But I also need to find a way to change the way these flowers are obtained.</p><p></p><p>If I need to buy tens of thousands of flowers every day, that would be too uneconomical.</p><p></p><p>Should I let them free-range?</p><p></p><p>But after thinking about it, Ye Xiao ultimately abandoned this decision.</p><p></p><p>If she's placed in the breeding ground, she won't run away, but if released, she runs faster than anyone. </p><p></p><p>The main reason is that my current cultivation hasn't reached the Innate Ninth Rank. If I were an Innate Ninth Rank expert, with spiritual power a level higher than hers, I could directly use spiritual power to forcibly impose a restriction on her, making her obediently return after collecting flowers.</p><p></p><p>It seems my cultivation is still not enough, I still need to find a way to quickly improve my cultivation.</p><p></p><p>Ye Xiao looked at the spiritual energy cultivation within himself, which has already reached about 50%, lacking only 50% more to break through to the Innate Ninth Rank.</p><p></p><p>In a few more days, slowly accumulating, and after a few days, he will go to the Forest Sea to see if he can find some better flowers to let Susan make honey with.</p><p></p><p>After collecting today's offerings from the star beasts, Ye Xiao left the breeding ground.</p><p></p><p>Noel Fei and the other star beasts gathered around, smiling and saying, "How is it? Raising poultry is actually pretty good, right? Just need to do a little bit every day, and the rest of the time is free. And you can also ensure your own safety.</p><p></p><p>You can play when you want to, and cultivate when you want to."</p><p></p><p>Although Susan didn't want to admit it, she still nodded.</p><p></p><p>"It's pretty good."</p><p></p><p>Mo Yu couldn't help but mutter:</p><p></p><p>"Everything else is good, it's just that it hurts so much when pinched! I still feel burning hot."</p><p></p><p>"You're already doing very well! It's just a squeeze, the deer is the unlucky one, having to release deer blood and cut off deer horns every day."</p><p></p><p>Ye Xiao went back and consumed all the offerings from the star beasts, not wasting a single bit.</p><p></p><p>His powerful body at the Saint Monarch level quickly digested all of it, absorbing the blood qi and spiritual energy within to enhance his own cultivation.</p><p></p><p>His cultivation instantly rose by about 1%, which is actually not a slow speed. To be honest, the most talented geniuses in this world could not possibly have such abundant resources to provide. From the Innate Eighth Rank to the Innate Ninth Rank, it would take at least several years, measured in years.</p><p></p><p>But his speed, it would probably only take about 100 days, just over 3 months, to reach that level.</p><p></p><p>Vastly stronger than others.</p><p></p><p>In the following half month, Ye Xiao obediently stayed in the library, clocking in for work every day, diligently reading books, and then returning home in the evenings to savor the delicious food, using the offerings from the star beasts to further improve his cultivation.</p><p></p><p>In half a month, Ye Xiao's cultivation had risen by just under 20%.</p><p></p><p>This way, he only had a little over 30% left to break through to the Innate Ninth Rank.</p><p></p><p>He had also learned the basic 8 techniques of the Claw Technique from the techniques he had targeted, and the paper recording the techniques was starting to faintly light up, indicating that he was close to successfully fusing an Imperial Claw Technique.</p><p></p><p>Cultivating the Claw Technique was something Ye Xiao had wanted to start after the previous experience of Susan and the others kidnapping Qin Yusheng.</p><p></p><p>Entering the spatial transmission array last time was actually a very risky move. If he wasn't careful, he could have been trapped in the chaotic spatial flow.</p><p></p><p>He still wasn't strong enough to resist that kind of spatial power.</p><p></p><p>So he needed a long-range control technique."</p>

        <div class="content">
            <p>Here is the full English translation of the Chinese excerpt:</p><p></p><p>Deep in the starry sky, accompanied by a distortion in space, a massive fleet of spiritual energy ships slowly emerged from the void.</p><p></p><p>Each spiritual energy ship had a golden flag with a nine-clawed divine dragon emblazoned on it, and the words "Xuanyuan" were engraved in large characters on the hull.</p><p></p><p>At the very front of the flagship, the largest spiritual energy ship, stood the figure of a handsome and upright young man, wearing a top-grade tiger-skin robe with exquisite dragon tendon embroidery. Not only was his attire magnificent, but the various attributes it possessed were also unfathomable.</p><p></p><p>Before long, a graceful and charming beauty emerged from within the spiritual energy ship.</p><p></p><p>Her lively and beautiful eyes looked towards the figure at the bow of the deck, filled with admiration and yearning.</p><p></p><p>Ning Zhiyuan, the legitimate young master of the Xuanyuan Clan! The 17th genius on the Xuanyuan Celestial Ranking! At the age of 39, he had already reached the realm of the Martial Emperor with 74 dragons!! He was adorned with so many glorious accolades, shining like a small sun, captivating every woman.</p><p></p><p>"Young Master Ning, the area ahead is the Xuanyuan descendant's small world codenamed 'Nine Provinces'. The spiritual energy ship has consumed a great deal of energy after a series of spatial jumps, so we will continue the journey using ordinary propulsion from here on."</p><p></p><p>Ning Zhiyuan's deep gaze swept across the starry sky as he spoke in a calm tone, "Our subordinates are still fighting in the distance, trapped in danger, and awaiting our rescue. We must proceed with full force, without any mistakes."</p><p></p><p>"Understood! I will instruct the propulsion department to activate the formation to the maximum, in order to arrive as soon as possible."</p><p></p><p>As soon as the words left her mouth, a series of urgent alarms suddenly sounded on the spiritual energy ship.</p><p></p><p>Hum! Hum! Hum! "Warning, there is an extremely powerful energy source ahead, in the front-left direction."</p><p></p><p>Ning Zhiyuan looked towards that direction, his eyes slightly narrowing, revealing his emerald-green pupils.</p><p></p><p>Emerald Fire Golden Eyes!</p><p></p><p>Ning Zhiyuan's innate divine eyes, ranked 87th on the Starry Sky Divine Eyes Ranking, a powerful divine sight.</p><p></p><p>When he activated the Emerald Fire Golden Eyes, the distant scene immediately came into view.</p><p></p><p>"This is...?"</p><p></p><p>His pupils contracted abruptly.</p><p></p><p>"Zhiyuan, what's going on?" the woman couldn't help but ask in confusion.</p><p></p><p>Ning Zhiyuan took a deep breath, his expression grave.</p><p></p><p>"Proceed forward."</p><p></p><p>"What? Young Master Ning, shouldn't we be rushing to the rescue?"</p><p></p><p>"The rescue can wait, let's go take a look first."</p><p></p><p>"Alright."</p><p></p><p>The woman could only order the crew to steer the spiritual energy ship forward.</p><p></p><p>Soon, the ship arrived at the location, but when everyone saw the situation there, they were all stunned.</p><p></p><p>"This... is someone undergoing Tribulation Ascension? A purple lightning tribulation? My goodness, a purple lightning tribulation in this world! This is the highest-level tribulation in the starry sky, even the top-ranked geniuses on the Xuanyuan Celestial Ranking have never encountered such a tribulation!"</p><p></p><p>The woman couldn't help but widen her eyes and exclaim in shock.</p><p></p><p>Ning Zhiyuan clenched his fists, his expression grave and puzzled.</p><p></p><p>He never imagined that there would be someone capable of unleashing a tribulation of this level in this place, it was simply unimaginable.</p><p></p><p>Who was it?</p><p></p><p>Who was the one undergoing this tribulation?</p><p></p><p>...</p><p></p><p>At that moment, the lightning in the sky was gathering more and more, becoming thicker and more intense! The deep purple lightning was infused with a sacred divine might that even Ye Xiao had never experienced before.</p><p></p><p>The oppressive pressure reached its limit!</p><p></p><p>One second, two seconds, three seconds... Finally, a purple lightning bolt as thick as a barrel, imbued with unparalleled power, swept towards the ground with unstoppable force.</p><p></p><p>Boom! It charged straight towards Ye Xiao's head, as if intent on tearing him to shreds.</p><p></p><p>The overwhelming power crashed into Ye Xiao's body, and this first purple lightning bolt was indeed formidable. Even though Ye Xiao had cultivated the Great Perfection Divine Body and possessed the strength of a Supremacy Realm cultivator with 108 dragons of divine blood, far exceeding ordinary people, he could still feel a slight pain.</p><p></p><p>And this was only the first tribulation. The tribulations would only grow stronger, with the final one potentially surpassing the first by a hundredfold or more! Ye Xiao took a deep breath and placed a medicinal pill in his mouth.</p><p></p><p>He had not yet activated any formations, as those were his last-resort survival methods. For now, it was best to temper his body with the tribulation lightning.</p><p></p><p>After swallowing the medicinal pill, an extremely violent power began to surge within his body, as if wanting to burst his meridians.</p><p></p><p>Ye Xiao spread his arms, as if challenging the tribulation, and the next moment, the tribulation lightning erupted furiously. The second tribulation lightning was three times more powerful than the first, crashing into Ye Xiao's body with tremendous force. The subsequent tribulations came even faster, with the speed increasing from one or two seconds per bolt to eventually reaching one bolt per second, continuously growing in intensity.</p><p></p><p>Ye Xiao's body gradually felt the pain of the tribulation lightning, but the impurities on his surface were being constantly expelled. This was an extremely rare opportunity to refine his physique.</p><p></p><p>As the thunderous roar of the lightning grew deeper and more intense, it signified the gradual birth of a divine being.</p><p></p><p>Here is the full English translation of the Chinese excerpt:</p><p></p><p>Ye Xiao could feel that his body was becoming stronger, just like his eyes, evolving to a higher level.</p><p></p><p>Once the evolution was successful, it would be no less than the divine eyes, able to withstand even higher-level cultivation techniques, and his innate talent would also increase significantly.</p><p></p><p>At this moment, Ye Xiao himself could not see it, but Ning Zhiyuan and the others in the distance could clearly see that within the thunderous tribulation, a golden giant figure had appeared, emanating an ancient but extremely majestic aura, as if it towered above all beings.</p><p></p><p>"Such powerful talent, it has actually triggered a celestial anomaly. This talent must represent a transformation of the body. With such a powerful physique, perhaps only the second-ranked Dragon Clan in the entire starry sky can match it, it's simply extraordinary."</p><p></p><p>Ning Zhiyuan couldn't help but swallow hard. At this moment, with countless halos above his head, he still felt insignificant in the face of this figure.</p><p></p><p>However, the anomaly did not end there. Suddenly, a pair of purple lights flashed from the golden giant's eyes.</p><p></p><p>Ning Zhiyuan couldn't help but feel his heart pounding violently again.</p><p></p><p>"Such powerful eyes, he has even awakened the divine eyes. The power of these divine eyes is dozens of times stronger than my Emerald Fire Golden Eyes, which ranks 87th in the starry sky. </p><p></p><p>Enough to break into the top ranks of the starry sky! Who is this person?"</p><p></p><p>In the thunderous tribulation, Ye Xiao's flesh and bones were gradually being shattered and charred by the lightning, until they turned to ashes.</p><p></p><p>But his bones were being tempered by the tribulation into pure golden color, a color only possessed by those at the divine realm.</p><p></p><p>After passing the initial stage of the tribulation, Ye Xiao's physique would gradually begin to transform towards the divine realm.</p><p></p><p>But whether he could withstand the tribulation would depend on his final strength.</p><p></p><p>At this moment, the tribulation had gradually progressed to the later stage, and the powerful force was starting to overwhelm Ye Xiao's bones.</p><p></p><p>"Divine Formation, open!"</p><p></p><p>At this time, Ye Xiao directly activated the divine formation, once again enhancing the spiritual energy in the air, pushing his power to a new limit.</p><p></p><p>The power of the Purple Thorn Divine Formation was absolutely beyond ordinary divine formations, and after being combined with the Golden Book, it had reached the level of a nine-star divine formation.</p><p></p><p>With the formation in place, Ye Xiao, who had previously been at a disadvantage, suddenly saw his strength surge again, allowing him to withstand even more heavenly thunder.</p><p></p><p>Boom, boom, boom. Under the continuous tempering of the tribulation, Ye Xiao's bones finally reached the divine realm standard, turning into a golden yellow color.</p><p></p><p>With the bones formed, the divine blood in the air began to continuously return and fuse into Ye Xiao's bones, reforming his flesh and blood.</p><p></p><p>At this moment, Ning Zhiyuan and the others could clearly see a pure golden dragon roaring beside the golden giant.</p><p></p><p>Everyone stared with wide eyes, unable to believe what they were seeing.</p><p></p><p>"He succeeded!"</p><p></p><p>"The purple tribulation, known as the highest level in the starry sky, has actually been broken through by him!"</p><p></p><p>But what shocked them even more was the golden dragon.</p><p></p><p>"The golden dragon circling and protecting the body, this person must be from the Xuanyuan Clan lineage. Only those who have successfully broken through will have the golden dragon protecting them."</p><p></p><p>The heartbeats of the crowd couldn't help but accelerate rapidly.</p><p></p><p>Breaking through the highest level purple tribulation in the starry sky was already extremely remarkable, and now the person's identity was also from the Xuanyuan Clan, this was simply like dropping a small child in their minds.</p><p></p><p>Shocking to the extreme.</p><p></p><p>However, the shock did not end there. As the purple tribulation reached its final stage, a phantom appeared in the starry sky. Then a second, a third, a fourth, and all these phantoms were bowing and paying respects towards Ye Xiao, as if they were paying homage to an extraordinary being.</p><p></p><p>The minds of the crowd were once again violently bombarded.</p><p></p><p>"This... he has successfully weathered the tribulation, and even evoked the reverence of so many ancient heroic spirits. My god, how far is this guy going to go?"</p><p></p><p>At this moment, Ning Zhiyuan felt that he was nothing in front of this person. His status as a young master, his identity as a scion of the Xuanyuan Clan, and his reputation as a Xuanyuan prodigy, all amounted to nothing.</p><p></p><p>The talent of this person was simply beyond comprehension, defying the heavens. Such a phenomenon only appeared in the presence of future unparalleled powerhouses in the starry sky, the kind of strength that left people awestruck.</p><p></p><p>Finally, as the last thunderous roar faded, Ye Xiao had completely restored his physique. At this moment, Ye Xiao was no longer an ordinary mortal, but a true divine realm cultivator! He had completely and thoroughly stepped into the realm of divine realm experts!</p><p></p><p>His power, his talent, had all been elevated to a brand new peak through this tempering.</p><p></p><p>The divine spirit of the Golden Book had also finally fused completely with him, allowing him to understand more of the profound mysteries of the Golden Book.</p>

        <h1>Chapter 302</h1>
        <div class="content">
            <p>Here is the full English translation of the Chinese excerpt:</p><p></p><p>The Demon Queen also stepped forward, but she was not as familiar as Ning Yuhen and Ye Xiao, so she was more respectful.</p><p></p><p>At this moment, what Demon Queen, what controller of the Silver Fox Clan - all of these things no longer mattered.</p><p></p><p>In front of Ye Xiao, she was just a tiny ant.</p><p></p><p>This was her only identity! "Thank you, Mr. Ye! You have saved my Silver Fox Clan, a great kindness that I can never repay. From now on, the Silver Fox Clan will serve you with all our might!"</p><p></p><p>Ye Xiao's expression remained calm as he replied, "The Demon Queen is too kind. As long as the Silver Fox Clan can maintain a friendly relationship with the human race, that would be the best."</p><p></p><p>"Mr. Ye, rest assured, the Silver Fox Clan will absolutely not damage the friendship with the human race."</p><p></p><p>Ye Xiao nodded, and she looked up at him, her gaze momentarily becoming a little dazed.</p><p></p><p>Ye Xiao was so young, he should only be twenty-one years old by now.</p><p></p><p>At this age, he had already broken through to the Emperor Realm, a legendary realm in the human race. The terrifying talent behind this was a hundred times more formidable than his current cultivation.</p><p></p><p>One couldn't help but wonder what realm he would reach in the future? Could he become a god?</p><p></p><p>Surpassing both the human race and the Star Beast Clan.</p><p></p><p>"For this trip to the Silver Fox Valley, I have stayed for many days under your care. As a reward, I will leave a few Emperor Formations here. With the Emperor Formations in place, and enough spirit stones, even Emperors would find it difficult to easily break through, making it relatively safer."</p><p></p><p>Ning Yuhen's heart tightened.</p><p></p><p>"Master, are you leaving so soon? Can't you stay a little longer?"</p><p></p><p>"No more staying. Although you predict that the Star Beasts will most likely launch a calamity within half a year, I feel that this time is still too long."</p><p></p><p>The Demon Queen was startled.</p><p></p><p>"Mr. Ye is saying that they will advance the time?"</p><p></p><p>Ye Xiao responded, "That's right, I just scanned the consciousness of those Deity Realm Star Beasts and know that they have been dispatched to this area.</p><p></p><p>The Star Beasts have completed the encirclement of the human world, and the calamity will be launched in at most one month.</p><p></p><p>I must hurry back to the human world and make preparations in advance."</p><p></p><p>"Then I'll go back with the Master."</p><p></p><p>Ning Yuhen immediately spoke up, but Ye Xiao shook his head.</p><p></p><p>"You should stay here and focus on improving your own strength. Protecting the Silver Fox Clan is your mission."</p><p></p><p>Ning Yuhen instantly deflated like a punctured balloon and fell silent.</p><p></p><p>"Alright then."</p><p></p><p>The Demon Queen patted his shoulder, comforting him, then turned to Ye Xiao and said:</p><p></p><p>"Since Mr. Ye says so, it must be true. We won't keep you any longer."</p><p></p><p>Ye Xiao nodded.</p><p></p><p>"Mountains and rivers will meet again, and there will be many more days for us to see each other in the future, until we meet again."</p><p></p><p>"Until we meet again."</p><p></p><p>The two parties bid farewell to each other, and Ye Xiao used the Yin-Yang Escape Technique to instantly leave the Silver Fox Valley.</p><p></p><p>While he was speaking just now, he had already set up the formations for the Silver Fox Valley.</p><p></p><p>After becoming an Emperor Realm expert, his speed had become even more astonishingly fast - a single thought could complete many tasks.</p><p></p><p>So while he was speaking, in less than three seconds, the formations were fully established.</p><p></p><p>After reaching the Emperor Realm, his Yin-Yang Escape Technique had also become faster than before. </p><p></p><p>Distances that originally took several seconds to reach could now be traversed in just a single second.</p><p></p><p>One second later, Ye Xiao had arrived at the barrier above the human world, the place from which he had emerged. He only needed to activate the transmission passage to return to the human world.</p><p></p><p>However, as soon as he arrived here, his divine sense detected the cries of battle raging in the distance, thousands of miles away.</p><p></p><p>He swept his spiritual sense and shot out a beam of light with a snap of his fingers, activating the spatial passage and entering the human world.</p><p></p><p>At the same time, on a distant battlefield, the human race and the Star Beasts were engaged in a fierce battle.</p><p></p><p>It was clear that the human race was at a disadvantage, while the Star Beast Clan held the upper hand.</p><p></p><p>Among the human forces, there was only one King Realm expert.</p><p></p><p>The Star Beasts not only had two Deity Realm experts, but their numbers were four times that of the human side! Even if it was a two-against-one or three-against-one situation, the Star Beasts would still emerge victorious, for their numbers were simply too overwhelming.</p><p></p><p>"Roarâ€”!"</p><p></p><p>"Kill all the humans! Tonight we will hold a grand feast and devour them all!"</p><p></p><p>The Star Beast Patriarch, a Deity Realm expert, let out a series of roars, constantly inciting the bloodthirsty and reckless Star Beasts to charge forward without fear of death.</p><p></p><p>The human army had already been breached and was in disarray.</p><p></p><p>At the current rate, it would not be long before the thousands of human warriors were all wiped out.</p><p></p><p>Amidst the chaotic battle, two Patriarch-level figures were relying on each other, back-to-back.</p><p></p><p>"Old Qin, you should quickly escape! We can't hold on much longer! I'll cover you and help you break through the encirclement, you must run!"</p><p></p><p>"But on the battlefield, everyone is fighting bravely, how can I just run away alone?"</p><p></p><p>"Fool! Don't you see that many have already fled? The order from the Starry Skies is that if you encounter a battle that is completely irreversible, you must quickly retreat. Preserving the overall strength of the human race is the priority."</p><p></p><p>Here is my translation of the Chinese excerpt:</p><p></p><p>"If we stay here, everyone will become food for the star beasts."</p><p></p><p>"No, we have to leave together."</p><p></p><p>"Don't be silly, the two of us can't make it out of here. Our whole team is already dead, it's just you and me left. You have to go, I'll hold them off. If you don't leave now, it'll be too late! Think about your granddaughter, she's already become part of the imperial bloodline, right? You have to live to see her future success! You can't die here."</p><p></p><p>Qin Shenglong gritted his teeth. Just a moment ago he had been unwavering, but hearing about his granddaughter, countless fond memories suddenly welled up inside him.</p><p></p><p>He had only just arrived at the star battlefield recently, but he had always heard how cruel and terrifying it was. </p><p></p><p>But today, he finally realized that the horror of the star battlefield was completely indescribable in words. </p><p></p><p>Its cruelty exceeded human imagination.</p><p></p><p>Sometimes, one moment you're chatting and joking with your teammates, and the next moment you're gone.</p><p></p><p>This was the brutality of the star battlefield - life and death were like child's play here.</p><p></p><p>They were just drifting duckweed in the rainstorm, with no say over their own fates.</p><p></p><p>He had only experienced this for a few months, but the human race had endured it for thousands of years! For thousands of years, this cruelty had been playing out in the starry skies, with countless human lives forever lost, defending the stable and peaceful lives of those on the ground.</p><p></p><p>If he fled to save himself, wouldn't that make him a coward? Then Yuyan would look down on him, and what would others think of Yuyan?</p><p></p><p>The imperial bloodline, his own granddaughter - her grandfather, a battlefield deserter! Abandoning his comrades, with no sense of righteousness or shame.</p><p></p><p>Even for her sake, he couldn't bring himself to do something so disgraceful. "Old Wang, I won't leave. If we go, we go together. If we die, we die together!"</p><p></p><p>"Old Qin, you're being foolish!"</p><p></p><p>Qin Shenglong just smiled, without saying anything more. Then he summoned all his sword techniques, fiercely hacking at the star beasts.</p><p></p><p>But there were simply too many star beasts, more than he could possibly cut down.</p><p></p><p>One second, two seconds, three seconds... He felt his consciousness starting to blur, his arms growing numb, his sword growing dull - he was about to lose the ability to keep fighting.</p><p></p><p>The star beasts were still surging towards him in endless waves.</p><p></p><p>Was this really the end? A grand master, barely a month into the star battlefield, and he would meet such a pitiful end. So a master was just a tiny, insignificant existence after all.</p><p></p><p>But just then, something unexpected happened.</p><p></p><p>Old Wang suddenly shouted beside him, "Old Qin, look at that! What is that?"</p><p></p><p>Qin Shenglong glanced over, and in that instant, he was completely frozen in place.</p><p></p><p>In the distance, a divine light was rapidly approaching the battlefield, like a dazzling shooting star.</p><p></p><p>The combatants on both sides gradually stopped fighting, and all living beings were curiously watching this beam of light.</p><p></p><p>It drew nearer and nearer, growing larger in everyone's eyes.</p><p></p><p>In that moment, both the star beasts and the human forces began to feel a sense of dread.</p><p></p><p>"Damn it, it's heading straight for us! Everyone, take cover!"</p><p></p><p>But its speed was simply too fast. </p><p></p><p>Just as everyone had barely reacted, it had already descended upon the battlefield. </p><p></p><p>A shockwave of light rapidly expanded outward. With terrifying power, it began to spread in a destructive frenzy. Everyone on the human side felt certain they were about to die.</p><p></p><p>But when the light faded and people opened their eyes again, they were stunned to find that all the star beasts had been reduced to ashes, while the human forces were completely unharmed! This sight left everyone utterly dumbfounded.</p><p></p><p>No one could have imagined such a thing would happen.</p><p></p><p>The battle had been hopelessly one-sided, but now, due to this divine light, the tide had turned in an unbelievable reversal.</p><p></p><p>"My god, who did this?"</p><p></p><p>"It must be one of our human ancestors. But among our people, who could possess such power? Remote attacks, with such precise control of spiritual energy. This person's methods are truly extraordinary."</p><p></p><p>"We must have encountered a legendary deity!"</p><p></p><p>On Ye Xiao's side, he quickly reopened the portal and returned to the human world.</p><p></p><p>Back in Jianghai City, Ye Xiao took a deep breath of the familiar air.</p><p></p><p>"Being back in my hometown feels much more comfortable."</p><p></p><p>A slight smile crossed his lips, and in the next moment, a figure came swiftly flying from the direction of the library - it was Xuanwu Venerable Jiang Chen, who had sensed Ye Xiao's presence and rushed over.</p><p></p><p>"Ye Xiao, it really is you. I've been waiting for you to come back."</p>

        <h1>Chapter 259</h1>
        <div class="content">
            <p>Here is the full English translation of the Chinese excerpt:</p><p></p><p>It was indeed the case.</p><p></p><p>Ye Xiao had already noticed that after the three-door divine art sword technique was synthesized, apart from the enlightenment of the opening of the heavens, the original paper containing the records of the sword technique had also merged from three pages into two.</p><p></p><p>This indicated that after the Slaying God Art, there should be one more synthesis, and it should be the final one.</p><p></p><p>After the complete synthesis, it should have reached its limit.</p><p></p><p>Beyond that, it is estimated that there would be no more techniques that could be synthesized.</p><p></p><p>Does this mean that in the future, after he has gathered and synthesized the Slaying God Art, he will become an invincible existence? Thinking about the word "invincible", Ye Xiao's heart couldn't help but jump a little.</p><p></p><p>If he could reach that level, he should be able to live peacefully in this world.</p><p></p><p>At that time, he should be able to go anywhere and do anything he wants.</p><p></p><p>He must synthesize more Slaying God Art.</p><p></p><p>Gather all the Slaying God Art!</p><p></p><p>Ye Xiao clenched his fists.</p><p></p><p>However, his mood soon calmed down.</p><p></p><p>Rome wasn't built in a day, and his current strength was only at the King Realm, far from that level of existence.</p><p></p><p>Step by step, steady and stable, that is the right path.</p><p></p><p>At the moment, he had already obtained the essence within this dragon vein, so there was no need to stay here any longer.</p><p></p><p>He did not attack the entire dragon vein.</p><p></p><p>To completely destroy the entire dragon vein above the Nine Realms would be too inhumane.</p><p></p><p>The dragon veins above the Nine Realms were already very few, if he were to destroy this one, it would be even more negligible.</p><p></p><p>From a long-term development perspective, it would not be beneficial for the human race.</p><p></p><p>Moreover, he had already obtained the essence part, and even if he were to absorb the remaining part, the increase in his cultivation would not be much.</p><p></p><p>Rather than doing so, it would be better to let it continue to play its role and nourish the Southwest Forest Sea.</p><p></p><p>Ye Xiao came to the surface, and he did not go to cultivate the Opening of the Heavens.</p><p></p><p>The techniques he had previously synthesized were already extremely powerful. Each time he displayed them, it would attract a lot of attention. This move was so powerful! If he were to use it in actual combat, he didn't know how many people it would attract.</p><p></p><p>Then it would cause a lot of trouble.</p><p></p><p>He simply began to exert his will, controlling the precious materials in the Southwest Forest Sea to quickly gather towards his body.</p><p></p><p>Once he had obtained the items, he could leave.</p><p></p><p>After reaching the King Realm, Ye Xiao only needed a thought to accomplish many things, as if within a certain area, he was the supreme ruler.</p><p></p><p>Perhaps, this is the meaning of the King Realm, being called a King.</p><p></p><p>A King is an existence that controls the life and death of a domain, like a divine being.</p><p></p><p>No one can resist the King Realm!</p><p></p><p>The surrounding star beasts had already all fled, with not a single one daring to approach this place.</p><p></p><p>Star beasts have stronger perception abilities than the human race.</p><p></p><p>They had already discovered Ye Xiao's terrifying nature, and no one dared to get close to him.</p><p></p><p>Under the starry sky, a few figures were also slowly approaching the center of the forest.</p><p></p><p>"Everyone, be careful! This is the center of the Forest Sea, where a large number of high-level star beasts have gathered. It is far from something we can easily deal with.</p><p></p><p>If possible, try to avoid fighting, otherwise, even if our team is very strong, we may still perish here."</p><p></p><p>"Understood!"</p><p></p><p>The cultivators in the team responded, their spiritual focus extremely tense, carefully observing everything around them.</p><p></p><p>This was a mercenary company with considerable strength in Chu Zhou.</p><p></p><p>This expedition to the Southwest Forest Sea was to search for more and better resources to improve their cultivation.</p><p></p><p>Because the deeper one goes into the Southwest Forest Sea, the better and more precious the items become.</p><p></p><p>So they had directly come to the very center of the Southwest Forest Sea.</p><p></p><p>But at the same time, the center of the Forest Sea also meant more dangers and stronger star beasts.</p><p></p><p>For this trip to successfully reach the center, the entire company had exhausted all its connections, bringing in a large number of top-tier experts from other companies.</p><p></p><p>The weakest member of this team was at least above the Innate Fourth Grade Grand Master realm.</p><p></p><p>It can be said without exaggeration that this team had drained the peak combat power from several surrounding cities.</p><p></p><p>With the help of this small team, they had finally arrived at the center of the Southwest Forest Sea. As long as they could harvest some top-tier materials, it would be worth the company's painstaking efforts to gather so many people.</p><p></p><p>"Captain, look at what's in front of us!"</p><p></p><p>The man called the captain glanced over, his eyes immediately lighting up.</p><p></p><p>It was the Spirit Pearl Fruit.</p><p></p><p>This fruit was quite strange, looking somewhat like a large spirit pearl, with an extremely hard exterior. After opening the skin, the inside was very soft, and there was also quite a bit of juice.</p><p></p><p>This fruit not only quenched thirst extremely well, but also had special properties, and could be used as an ingredient in the refinement of some powerful elixirs.</p><p></p><p>Its value was extraordinary.</p><p></p><p>"I never expected to encounter Spirit Pearl Fruit right here. We really are quite lucky.</p><p></p><p>Quickly, gather up all of it and take it away."</p><p></p><p>Here is my translation of the Chinese excerpt:</p><p></p><p>This hasn't even reached the very center of the Forest Sea, yet we've already encountered such a precious treasure. I wonder what kind of extraordinary treasures we'll find at the absolute heart of the Forest Sea.</p><p></p><p>However, one of the team members couldn't help but speak up:</p><p></p><p>"Captain, don't you find this a bit strange? We've reached the core region of the Forest Sea, if not the absolute center, which should be an extremely important area. Normally, there should be many spirit beasts here. But so far, have you noticed any spirit beasts at all? There aren't even any around these Spirit Pearl Fruits."</p><p></p><p>The captain paused and nodded. </p><p></p><p>"You make a good point. But it's possible a powerful senior cultivator previously cleared out the spirit beasts here."</p><p></p><p>Last time Ye Xiao came to the Southwest Forest Sea, he had taken action. That time, with a single sword strike, he had cleaved open a massive gorge in the Forest Sea. He had also used the Tathagata Divine Palm to support several collapsing mountains within the Forest Sea. Those shocking feats were still widely spoken of as legends in the Southwest Forest Sea, continuing to influence many people.</p><p></p><p>"Be careful! Keep watch all around, in case a powerful spirit beast launches a sneak attack. Let's hurry and collect the Spirit Pearl Fruits, then get out of here quickly."</p><p></p><p>However, as soon as he spoke, one of the team members suddenly pointed ahead and let out a terrified cry:</p><p></p><p>"Captain, look!"</p><p></p><p>The captain followed his gaze and his pupils immediately constricted at what he saw. The Spirit Pearl Fruits were floating up into the air on their own, without anyone picking them, drifting towards the center of the Forest Sea.</p><p></p><p>"Captain, look over there as well."</p><p></p><p>Another team member had noticed something else unusual. The captain quickly turned his head and his heart raced, scalp tingling. It wasn't just the Spirit Pearl Fruits - most of the precious treasures throughout the Southwest Forest Sea were now floating, drawn by some unseen force towards the center of the Forest Sea. </p><p></p><p>It was a bizarre, almost supernatural scene, seeming almost unreal yet undeniably real.</p><p></p><p>After the initial shock, the captain immediately said, "You all stay here. Don't come with me." </p><p></p><p>He then ran towards the floating treasures, determined to see what was causing this strange phenomenon. But the other team members didn't listen, and quickly followed behind him.</p><p></p><p>"Didn't I tell you not to come?" the captain said helplessly.</p><p></p><p>"Captain, we can't just let you satisfy your curiosity alone while we wait here," one of them replied.</p><p></p><p>Sighing, the captain simply said, "Be careful. If there's any danger, retreat immediately. Don't linger."</p><p></p><p>"Understood!"</p><p></p><p>They soon reached a hilltop overlooking the heart of the Forest Sea, and were utterly dumbfounded by the sight before them. </p><p></p><p>Countless treasures were floating, converging into a golden light. Within that light, they could vaguely make out a human figure. </p><p></p><p>This person, controlling all these precious treasures with such ease, must possess unimaginable power - power that made the grand masters before them feel as insignificant as ants. </p><p></p><p>The figure briefly glanced in their direction, and they felt as if their very souls had been laid bare. Then, with a simple turn, the figure vanished, disappearing without a trace.</p><p></p><p>It was all so dreamlike, so unreal.</p>

        <h1>Chapter 190</h1>
        <div class="content">
            <p>Here is the full English translation of the Chinese excerpt:</p><p></p><p>Afterwards, he got up with a confused expression, feeling his chest, looking puzzled.</p><p></p><p>"My injuries are all healed? What's going on? Wasn't I just severely wounded by the star beast?"</p><p></p><p>Yue Xinling flew to his side and explained:</p><p></p><p>"It was the Sword Immortal from Jianghai City who saved us."</p><p></p><p>Lian Chiming was startled.</p><p></p><p>"His healing art is that powerful as well?"</p><p></p><p>Yue Xinling nodded.</p><p></p><p>"Heavens, this senior is a bit too formidable, isn't he? Not only is his attack power so strong, but his healing art is also so powerful, almost reaching the realm of invincibility."</p><p></p><p>Lian Chiming couldn't help but sigh.</p><p></p><p>Possessing healing art means having unlimited endurance. This senior, in battles with others, would always be in an undefeated position.</p><p></p><p>After all, there are almost none in the world who can cultivate both combat strength and healing art to such a high level.</p><p></p><p>Calculated this way, within the same realm, perhaps no one would be a match for this senior!</p><p></p><p>"It's not quite so. Although he possesses such powerful means, he also requires a vast amount of spiritual energy to support it. If he doesn't have enough spiritual energy, it would be useless.</p><p></p><p>One can only say that in single combat, he is close to invincible. But if too many star beasts surround and attack him, he may not necessarily be able to resist.</p><p></p><p>He is, after all, a human, not a god!</p><p></p><p>However, even so, he is still very strong. It is a blessing for the human race to have such a powerful expert."</p><p></p><p>Lian Chiming nodded. Yue Xinling's assessment was indeed very reasonable. Although Ye Xiao was powerful, if his cultivation methods were not sufficient, he would not be able to perfectly unleash his formidable strength.</p><p></p><p>But this did not prevent him from being a powerful figure among the human race.</p><p></p><p>Because others would not be able to easily cultivate so many techniques, possess so many means, and have such high endurance.</p><p></p><p>In the Jianghai Martial Arts Academy, after Lian Chiming was knocked away and the two great divine sects charged into the starry sky, Liu Chengxun made his move.</p><p></p><p>The Sword Dao itself emphasizes speed as the main principle. Its speed is so fast, moving like a shooting star, from one strike to the next, it is almost instantaneous.</p><p></p><p>Therefore, the moment he disappeared, there was no longer any trace of Liu Chengxun in the air, only countless rapidly slashing sword beams.</p><p></p><p>Boom, boom, boom...</p><p></p><p>Each sword beam fell precisely on the divine sect star beast's body.</p><p></p><p>Moreover, the strike points were all in the same few locations.</p><p></p><p>As a divine sect expert, Liu Chengxun had rich combat experience, so he immediately saw that this star beast belonged to the power and defensive type.</p><p></p><p>If the strikes were scattered, even within the same realm, he might not be able to break through its defense. He had to concentrate his power, and not just attack one point, as the opponent would defend and shift positions.</p><p></p><p>So Liu Chengxun chose a few of the opponent's weak points as the focus of his attacks.</p><p></p><p>Sword beams struck once, ten times, a hundred times, a thousand times... Such a multitude of attacks were almost all completed within two seconds.</p><p></p><p>Often, the power of the previous sword had not yet dissipated, when the damage from the next sword had already arrived.</p><p></p><p>Under Liu Chengxun's fierce and swift slashes, the opponent's armor like diamond was finally slashed open with several sword marks, spraying out fresh green beast blood, like colorful fireworks, emitting a faint glow.</p><p></p><p>"Got it!"</p><p></p><p>Liu Chengxun's eyes sharpened, and next would be a full-force strike, concentrating all his remaining power into one of the wounds, injecting his violent sword dao power into the opponent's body from the inside to destroy it!</p><p></p><p>Stepping on the ground, spiritual energy burst forth, within a hundred meters, it was Liu Chengxun's domain!</p><p></p><p>His sword dao comprehension was fully displayed at this moment, as if there was only one sword beam within a hundred meters.</p><p></p><p>However, just at this time, a tearing and agonizing pain suddenly surged from the meridians within Liu Chengxun's body.</p><p></p><p>It was the wound inflicted by the Sword Immortal's previous strike, which had not yet fully healed.</p><p></p><p>Now, by forcefully unleashing his full power, the wound had been torn open again.</p><p></p><p>But he had no choice, the arrow was already on the string, he had to let it fly!</p><p></p><p>"Die!"</p><p></p><p>The sword beam thundered out, a dazzling white light filled the heavens and earth, as if locking the visual senses of all living beings around.</p><p></p><p>This stunning sword strike arrived in an instant, right in front of the divine sect star beast.</p><p></p><p>The distance to that wound was only half a centimeter.</p><p></p><p>Victory was at hand!</p><p></p><p>"You couldn't possibly think that would be enough to kill me, could you?"</p><p></p><p>At this moment, a mocking voice suddenly reached Liu Chengxun's ears.</p><p></p><p>Not only that, the star beast's hands formed into palms, directly slapping down on the sword beam from left and right.</p><p></p><p>"Boom!"</p><p></p><p>Accompanied by a violent explosion, Liu Chengxun's sword beam was violently shaken and shattered.</p><p></p><p>"Damn it!"</p><p></p><p>Liu Chengxun's heart sank, this sword beam had concentrated his current strongest power, and its uncontrolled explosion between them would be anything but ordinary.</p><p></p><p>But the opponent had extremely strong defense, while his own defense was far from as strong. In the next moment, he was directly blasted away by the huge explosive force.</p><p></p><p>In an instant, Liu Chengxun felt as if his internal organs were about to be displaced.</p><p></p><p>The shockwave from the explosion had almost leveled half of the Jianghai Martial Arts Academy.</p><p></p><p>If the students had not already been evacuated, there would have been many casualties.</p><p></p><p>Liu Chengxun crashed into a building, coughing up a mouthful of fresh blood, his complexion withered.</p><p></p><p>Here is the full English translation of the Chinese excerpt:</p><p></p><p>It had reached its limit.</p><p></p><p>He was already injured, and now the injuries had only worsened, to the point where he could barely lift his arm. </p><p></p><p>The radiance faded, and the star beast's body also had numerous wounds, but the vast majority were blocked by the protective armor on its surface.</p><p></p><p>So its injuries were very light, and under the powerful life force of the Innate Eighth Rank, it was quickly healing.</p><p></p><p>Liu Chengxun's gaze was gloomy. If he hadn't been injured, he definitely could have killed the opponent with that last strike.</p><p></p><p>But alas, there are no "ifs" in this world.</p><p></p><p>Unexpectedly, he was going to die on the land of the Nine Prefectures. Was this considered returning to his roots? The Divine Ancestor Star Beast slowly stepped towards Liu Chengxun, an evil smile emerging on its bizarre insect-like face, making it even more hideous.</p><p></p><p>"As expected, you are truly a human warrior of the Innate Eighth Rank, almost killing me. </p><p></p><p>But unfortunately, it seems you are injured, so there's no other choice. Obediently let me devour you.</p><p></p><p>An Innate Eighth Rank human, hehe, should be enough to greatly increase my strength?"</p><p></p><p>Liu Chengxun sighed deeply, looking up at the sky.</p><p></p><p>As a strong cultivator, he had the resolve of a strong one.</p><p></p><p>For martial artists, it's either kill or be killed. No one knows when that day will come, but since it has arrived, there's no need to be a coward.</p><p></p><p>No need to cry and wail, acting like a delicate young lady.</p><p></p><p>Eighteen years later, another hero! But as he looked up at the sky, the corners of his mouth inexplicably curled up.</p><p></p><p>"It seems I don't have to die after all."</p><p></p><p>The Divine Ancestor Star Beast's pupils constricted, and it immediately became alert when it sensed something was off in Liu Chengxun's expression.</p><p></p><p>"Hmph! Trying to sneak attack me? Seeking death!" </p><p></p><p>It let out a fierce roar and turned around, throwing a punch. The tremendous power of the Innate Eighth Rank was perfectly unleashed at this moment. The power was so overwhelming that it caused the entire air to tremble, rapidly compressing the air and spiritual energy, forming a vacuum zone! It was confident that this punch could make the sneak attacker suffer unbearable pain.</p><p></p><p>However! It was mistaken.</p><p></p><p>The fist it had always been extremely confident in was met by an even stronger one the moment it turned around.</p><p></p><p>That fist was small, only the size of a normal adult male human, compared to its own fist, like a porcelain bowl to an iron basin! But the power in that fist was so overwhelming that it could not withstand it.</p><p></p><p>In the instant the two fists collided, its invincible iron fist began to deform, shatter, and explode like bubbles.</p><p></p><p>From the fist to the elbow, everything was shattered. The tremendous impact made it lose its balance, retreating, but that one punch did not lose its momentum, directly striking its chest.</p><p></p><p>Without a doubt, one punch pierced through its chest, shattering the beating heart inside, and then penetrating through its back.</p><p></p><p>Great Annihilation Fist! </p><p>One punch to annihilate everything! So powerful!</p><p></p><p>This was its final thought.</p><p></p><p>It didn't even get to see what the opponent looked like.</p><p></p><p>Because the opponent's speed was too fast, too fast for its vision to capture.</p><p></p><p>It wanted to lower its head to get a clear look at the opponent, but its consciousness was already fading into obscurity.</p><p></p><p>Liu Chengxun coughed and immediately forced himself to speak:</p><p></p><p>"Senior, junior Liu Chengxun wishes to seek an audience with the senior."</p><p></p><p>Unfortunately, before he could finish speaking, Ye Xiao had already left with the Divine Ancestor Star Beast, not giving him a chance to speak.</p><p></p><p>But before leaving, Ye Xiao snapped his fingers, releasing a healing aura that fell on Liu Chengxun, quickly repairing his injuries.</p><p></p><p>This person acted to defend Jianghai City, and although he was the Sword Saint of Han Prefecture, he was still worthy of being saved.</p><p></p><p>Returning a favor, after all.</p><p></p><p>Feeling the revitalizing sensation within his body, Liu Chengxun was not overjoyed, but rather shocked.</p><p></p><p>"I never expected the senior to also possess healing arts! And of such a high level. Truly a divine person!</p><p></p><p>It's just a pity that I still couldn't meet the senior face to face, how regrettable!"</p><p></p><p>However, his gaze soon became resolute.</p><p></p><p>"Senior, I, Liu Chengxun, will definitely find you! Two years is not enough, then I'll add another year! Three years!</p><p></p><p>In three years, while both of us are in Jianghai City, I refuse to believe I won't have the chance to find you."</p><p></p><p>On the other side, Ye Xiao collected the corpse of the Divine Ancestor Star Beast and immediately pursued into the sky.</p><p></p><p>His speed was terrifyingly fast. Even though the opponent had already flown away for a few seconds, for him, catching up was effortless.</p><p></p><p>In the sky above, the two Divine Ancestor Star Beasts, Moju and Su Shan, had already entered the high-altitude domain.</p><p></p><p>"This location, the teleportation array should be nearby. Open the teleportation array."</p><p></p><p>"But Iron Ox hasn't come up yet."</p><p></p><p>"Don't worry, with its strength, dealing with that Innate Eighth Rank human won't take more than a minute. Open the array first, it should be arriving soon."</p><p></p><p>This is the second update, 6,000 words.</p><p></p><p>Please recommend votes, monthly votes, and subscriptions.</p><p></p><p>Although it may seem like Liu Chengxun fought for a long time, as I wrote above, it was actually only a few seconds.</p><p></p><p>The speed of the experts is so fast that what takes an ordinary person half a day, they can accomplish in just a few seconds.</p><p></p><p>I hope there is no misunderstanding about why the protagonist's speed is so fast, yet it hasn't been long.</p><p></p><p>(This chapter is complete)</p>

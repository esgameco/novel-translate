        <h1>Chapter 228</h1>
        <div class="content">
            <p>Here is the full English translation of the Chinese excerpt:</p><p></p><p>Boom! Another violent explosion rang out, and the divine beast was once again knocked down from the sky by Ye Xiao, crashing into the great mountain.</p><p></p><p>But this time, he directly collapsed the entire mountain.</p><p></p><p>The impact force was simply too strong!</p><p></p><p>He crashed violently into the ground, re-excavating an even larger crater over a kilometer in diameter from the one he had previously flattened.</p><p></p><p>He could feel his heart had already ruptured. How could this human's fist be so powerful?</p><p></p><p>If he wasn't a divine beast expert with a powerful physique, he would have died from just that one blow.</p><p></p><p>No, he can't keep fighting like this, if he continues, he won't be able to hold on and will surely die.</p><p></p><p>Flee! Just as he was about to flee, his body hadn't even caught up to his thoughts yet, the next moment he suddenly froze, not daring to move at all.</p><p></p><p>Cold sweat started pouring from his forehead, dripping down.</p><p></p><p>"Don't move, I have a few questions for you."</p><p></p><p>Gulp! He swallowed his saliva.</p><p></p><p>Boom! The next moment, Ye Xiao's fist suddenly smashed into his chest, punching straight through his body.</p><p></p><p>"Ughâ€”!"</p><p></p><p>He violently coughed up a mouthful of fresh blood, his eyes completely bloodshot and congested.</p><p></p><p>This guy! </p><p></p><p>Just for swallowing his saliva, he actually struck? </p><p></p><p>What's going on? "I told you not to move."</p><p></p><p>Ye Xiao withdrew his fist, the fresh blood dripping down from his knuckles.</p><p></p><p>Then, he spoke calmly:</p><p></p><p>"The divine beasts have been deployed for hundreds of years, to what extent has it reached? Don't tell me you don't know, you are a divine beast at the divine lord level, your lifespan should have already exceeded thousands of years. It's impossible that you don't know about this matter."</p><p></p><p>The opponent already knew he couldn't escape, having been severely injured twice in a row, he now even struggled to stand up, let alone flee.</p><p></p><p>"You think I'll tell you?"</p><p></p><p>Crack! Ye Xiao directly stepped on and broke his claw, the pain causing him to grit his teeth.</p><p></p><p>"I told you to answer, not ask."</p><p></p><p>"Just kill me! If you have the guts, just kill me directly, you'll never get anything out of me."</p><p></p><p>Ye Xiao frowned slightly, it seems this guy is determined not to cooperate.</p><p></p><p>Since that's the case, there's no need to waste time with him.</p><p></p><p>The Profound Heaven Astral Hammer activated, directly invading his soul.</p><p></p><p>But unexpectedly, at this moment, he suddenly burst into laughter.</p><p></p><p>"Hahaha, you fell for it! This lord was just waiting for you to use spiritual power to search for my consciousness.</p><p></p><p>If you didn't use spiritual power to search for my consciousness, this lord might not have been able to deal with you.</p><p></p><p>But you used spiritual power, so you're done for.</p><p></p><p>Because this lord's strongest abilities are not martial arts attacks, but spiritual attacks and soul attacks."</p><p></p><p>The next moment, his soul directly surged into Ye Xiao's mind along the spiritual power.</p><p></p><p>Victory!</p><p></p><p>Although the process was extremely perilous, the final result remained unchanged.</p><p></p><p>This is also why he dared to come to the Central State City alone as a single divine beast, his true body is the Yin Bat bloodline, which is naturally the strongest in spiritual power and soul attacks.</p><p></p><p>Often, many divine lord experts who are stronger than him, underestimate his martial cultivation, and end up all dying to this move of his.</p><p></p><p>Now Ye Xiao is the same.</p><p></p><p>As long as he slays this guy and devours his vital energy, it will be enough for him to advance to an even stronger existence, perhaps even making up for the current shortcomings in his martial cultivation.</p><p></p><p>However, when he arrived in Ye Xiao's body and saw Ye Xiao's soul, the entire bat fell into deep contemplation.</p><p></p><p>What's going on? Is this a joke? This human actually cultivates soul power as well?</p><p></p><p>If his own spiritualized soul is about the size of a two-story building, then the other party's spiritualized soul is as tall as a ten-story building. Compared to him, he's like an eternally small child, probably not even qualified to play with the other party.</p><p></p><p>Ye Xiao spoke indifferently: </p><p></p><p>"Surprised? Unexpected?"</p><p></p><p>Thud! He plopped down on his butt, the entire Yin Bat soul completely despairing.</p><p></p><p>His method of defeating others with his soul was to first enter the other person's body, then tear apart the other person's soul, thereby gaining control of their body, so he could repair his own body and return to his own body.</p><p></p><p>Finally, he would devour the other person's body.</p><p></p><p>Now, he has come to Ye Xiao's body, but he knows he definitely can't defeat Ye Xiao's soul in a fight. If he can't defeat Ye Xiao's soul, it means he can't go back.</p><p></p><p>Isn't that just doomed? "I give up, I really give up. Are you even human? I doubt you're even human."</p><p></p><p>Ye Xiao's expression remained indifferent. "Answer my question."</p><p></p><p>"If I tell you, will you let me go?"</p><p></p><p>"I can."</p><p></p><p>"Then I'll tell you."</p><p></p><p>The Yin Bat spread his hands. "To be honest, I don't know. Don't attack me, I'm telling the truth.</p><p></p><p>Because we divine beasts are not all controlled by the same divine beast, we also have..."</p><p></p><p>Here is the full English translation of the Chinese excerpt:</p><p></p><p>There are many factions.</p><p></p><p>Like me, I belong to the Qilin Deity. And there are some star beasts that may belong to the Tiger Deity, or other deity realm star beasts.</p><p></p><p>On the surface, we all appear to be star beasts, but we are actually in a competitive relationship, all trying to see who can devour more of the human race faster.</p><p></p><p>The ones who formulate the invasion plans are the super divine beasts, while the ones responsible for implementation are the divine beasts. Like me, a primordial ninth-grade deity sect star beast, I'm actually just a worker.</p><p></p><p>Ye Xiao raised his eyebrows slightly, his expression unable to help but become somewhat grave.</p><p></p><p>It seems the star beasts' strength is very powerful. A primordial ninth-grade deity sect star beast is actually just considered a worker.</p><p></p><p>Then how strong must the true power-holders among the star beasts be?</p><p></p><p>At this moment, Ye Xiao suddenly understood why this world has been hiding the existence of the experts above the King and Emperor realms from ordinary people.</p><p></p><p>The pressure that the star battlefield has to bear is just too great, too great.</p><p></p><p>The human race on the ground, when facing a beast calamity, are already trembling with fear, let alone hearing about these divine beasts and super divine beasts.</p><p></p><p>The martial path of martial artists must forge ahead, requiring courage to support it.</p><p></p><p>If they knew that the star beasts are too powerful to defeat, and the human race is always at a disadvantage, then most people would likely lose hope. And without hope, the human race would sink into pessimism and despair.</p><p></p><p>Humanity needs gradual progress, a step-by-step guidance with goodwill.</p><p></p><p>When those experts reach higher achievements on the martial path, and their hearts have become more resolute, after knowing these things, they would not be so frightened as to be unwilling to take action.</p><p></p><p>"Do you have an estimate of how much chance the human race has against the star beasts?"</p><p></p><p>"If I tell you the truth, will you promise not to hit me?"</p><p></p><p>"As long as you tell the truth, I won't hit you."</p><p></p><p>Ye Xiao had been using the Taixuan Tiangong to monitor the other party's soul, so he could see clearly whether he was lying or not.</p><p></p><p>The Yinbat pondered for a moment, then cautiously spoke:</p><p></p><p>"To be honest, I think there is not even a 10% chance."</p><p></p><p>"What makes you say that?"</p><p></p><p>"It's simple. Do you know how many of us star beasts there are? And how few humans there are?</p><p></p><p>If it weren't for the array formations on the surface of your world protecting it, we would have invaded from all sides long ago. This world can't even accommodate our military forces.</p><p></p><p>Even if we self-destruct half of ourselves, we could still blast this world to the heavens.</p><p></p><p>Do you think the human race can possibly defeat us? In addition, there is another very important factor.</p><p></p><p>The strong experts of the human race are too few!</p><p></p><p>Without top-tier experts capable of turning the tide of battle, everything is futile. I'm not talking about the King or Emperor realms, of course, but what realm is beyond that, I can't say for sure.</p><p></p><p>I know humans have such powerful experts, but they are very few, infinitesimal, and maybe only one appears every few hundred years.</p><p></p><p>And most of them have perished in battle, and it's been a long time since we've heard of such existences among humans.</p><p></p><p>But us star beasts, do you know how many there are? Just in this current era, the ones I'm aware of are more than two!"</p><p></p><p>Ye Xiao's eyes narrowed slightly, he could sense that the other party was not lying.</p><p></p><p>Could it be that there are even mightier experts beyond the Emperor realm? And it seems the human race's top experts are extremely rare, possibly only one or two, or they may even no longer exist.</p><p></p><p>While the star beasts have more than two such level of existence? This is really not good.</p><p></p><p>After a moment of contemplation, he spoke again:</p><p></p><p>"Let me ask you one more question. Why do the star beasts want to devour humans? Is it really just because by devouring humans, you can gain their learning aptitude?"</p><p></p><p>This question has always been troubling Ye Xiao.</p><p></p><p>The star beasts and the human race have been fighting for so many years, by normal logic, they should have already learned the learning ability of the human race.</p><p></p><p>Many star beasts can even learn other Emperor techniques, like the Yinbat in front of him, the claw technique he just used should not be from his own bloodline.</p><p></p><p>In this case, the reason to painstakingly devour the human race seems a bit far-fetched.</p><p></p><p>If they want to improve their strength, the star beasts would be better off devouring their own kind, as that might be faster than devouring humans.</p><p></p><p>The Yinbat spoke again:</p><p></p><p>"That's because there is a belief that has been passed down among us star beasts. Humans are actually the descendants of the Deity Clan!</p><p></p><p>In the starry sky, there are existences stronger than both humans and star beasts, and that is the Deities!</p><p></p><p>They are the true supreme beings that transcend all living creatures, immortal and indestructible. If humans have great fortune, they can give birth to beings with Deity Clan bloodline.</p><p></p><p>Star beasts with great fortune can also give birth to Divine Beast bloodline.</p><p></p><p>Whether it's star beasts or humans, we all yearn to become such existences.</p><p></p><p>But this bloodline is extremely rare, it might take hundreds of billions or even thousands of billions of star beasts to refine it.</p><p></p><p>While for humans, just tens of billions have the chance to refine the Deity Blood.</p><p></p><p>Whether it's the Deity Blood of humans or the Deity Blood of star beasts, as long as it is consumed, there is a chance to evolve into an immortal Deity!"</p>

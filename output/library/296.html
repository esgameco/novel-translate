        <h1>Chapter 296</h1>
        <div class="content">
            <p>Here is the full English translation of the Chinese excerpt:</p><p></p><p>Many martial artists can obtain the same cultivation resources.</p><p></p><p>However, the resources in this world are limited, and they are not enough to allow everyone to cultivate to the Emperor Realm, let alone the later Deity Realm experts.</p><p></p><p>At that time, the human race was facing countless star beasts, some of which were even super divine beasts with great potential to evolve into Sovereign-level super powerhouses, comparable to the realm of human martial gods.</p><p></p><p>If the opponent appeared at the Sovereign level, it would be a catastrophic disaster for the human race.</p><p></p><p>Helplessly, the human race had to change its cultivation system at the time.</p><p></p><p>It was changed from a system where resources were shared by all, to one where the stronger shared more resources.</p><p></p><p>In other words, the better the innate talent and the faster the cultivation, the more resources one would obtain, while those with poor talent would have fewer resources, and could even be left with none in the future.</p><p></p><p>This is the reason why the hidden weak members of the human race became weaker and weaker, while the rare geniuses and powerhouses were elevated higher and higher.</p><p></p><p>But precisely because of this, the genes of the vast majority of the human race would become weaker and weaker. If they were to intermarry with those geniuses, it would lead to an increase in the human population, but the powerful divine blood would become more and more dispersed.</p><p></p><p>I saw this drawback at the time and did not agree to it, so with the consent of the other Emperors, I had King Zhou replace me to continue the reform."</p><p></p><p>Ye Xiao nodded, if it was as Jiang Ziya described, then it was understandable why the human race was becoming weaker and weaker.</p><p></p><p>"Then what about the second point? The origin between the human race and the divine race, is it just to confront the star beasts that the human race must cultivate a divine race?"</p><p></p><p>"This is only one aspect." Jiang Ziya directly interrupted Ye Xiao's words.</p><p></p><p>"Preventing the appearance of Sovereign-level star beasts is indeed a concern for the human race, but there is another more important reason why the human race wants to create Deity Realm experts.</p><p></p><p>You should know that this starry sky is vast, far beyond your imagination. </p><p></p><p>In the starry sky, there are countless races. The mightiest lineage among them is the Divine Race. But even within the Divine Race, there are countless divisions.</p><p></p><p>The human race in our world originates from the Xuanyuan Clan within the Divine Race.</p><p></p><p>Thousands of years ago, the ancestors of the human race, in the human world, discovered a profound secret. If they could obtain this secret, it would likely allow them to break through to an unparalleled realm.</p><p></p><p>In order to obtain this secret, they remained in the mortal world and gave birth to the vast human race.</p><p></p><p>But the human race has not yet fully unraveled this secret, and they have left it for their descendants, which is us.</p><p></p><p>He said that if one could obtain that secret, they would gain a power that even the gods would fear.</p><p></p><p>To unravel that secret, the required strength must be at least at the Deity Realm, or one could say that only Deity Realm experts have the qualifications to enter.</p><p></p><p>Hearing this, Ye Xiao's pupils suddenly contracted.</p><p></p><p>A power that even the gods would fear, no wonder! No wonder the ancestors of the human race, even though they were already at the level of the Divine Race, still chose to multiply and leave behind descendants in this land.</p><p></p><p>Unexpectedly, the human world still hides such a huge secret.</p><p></p><p>An enigma that even the gods fear, one can't imagine how powerful it would be. If one could obtain it, would it not make oneself reach the invincible state one dreams of? Ye Xiao clenched his fists, and a hint of fanaticism flashed in his eyes.</p><p></p><p>He cultivated single-mindedly, with the only goal of becoming an invincible person. Now it seems that this thing may be exactly what he desires.</p><p></p><p>Seemingly sensing Ye Xiao's thoughts, Jiang Ziya smiled.</p><p></p><p>"Don't think too much about it. That thing, even the ancestors of the human race were unable to unravel, let alone you.</p><p></p><p>I'm not trying to discourage you, but throughout history, countless people have tried to break through to the Martial God Realm, and reaching the Martial God Realm is only just barely enough to obtain the entry ticket to that secret.</p><p></p><p>As for unraveling the secret, that's even more impossible to imagine.</p><p></p><p>However, if you can reach the Martial God Realm, you will be able to activate the summoning stele left behind by the human race's ancestors, and summon the divine emissaries of the Xuanyuan Clan. It is said that the divine emissaries of the Xuanyuan Clan can bring those who have fully activated the Xuanyuan divine bloodline to the world where the Divine Race resides.</p><p></p><p>If that's the case, you may have even greater achievements and more opportunities to delve into that secret."</p><p></p><p>Ye Xiao shook his head.</p><p></p><p>"Let's not talk about that for now, I'm only at the half-step Emperor Realm, still far from that realm.</p><p></p><p>I've already learned about two issues, now the last one remains: how should I break through the Emperor Realm?"</p><p></p><p>"That's easy. The Emperor Realm relies on realm insights. You are now at the peak of the King Realm, only lacking a thread of realization. I will impart my own insights to you, and you can use my insights to realize your final thread of insight."</p><p></p><p>With that, Jiang Ziya snapped his fingers, directly sending his insights into the center of Ye Xiao's brow.</p><p></p><p>These were Jiang Ziya's insights upon reaching the Emperor Realm.</p><p></p><p>The insights of each martial artist upon entering the Emperor Realm are different, but they all adhere to the same principles.</p><p></p><p>Here is the full English translation of the excerpt from the Chinese novel:</p><p></p><p>His purpose was that as long as he could see one or two insights into the Emperor's Realm, he would be able to comprehend the spiritual essence of his own breakthrough to the Emperor's Realm.</p><p></p><p>Emperor! A single word can split mountains and rivers, a single word can bury the sun and moon.</p><p></p><p>Emperor! Sole arbiter of the ages, who can rival him? Emperor! Slaying all under heaven, the azure sky trembles.</p><p></p><p>The insights Ye Xiao obtained were actually impossible to describe with words, as they were more of a special state of mind formed within his own spirit.</p><p></p><p>For example, if you are on the ground, your field of vision is definitely fixed.</p><p></p><p>But if you are in the sky? What can your eyes not encompass, the myriad mountains and rivers? Sometimes, even if you understand the principles, to truly comprehend them, you must reach that level yourself, and then you can form an innate impression in your mind, thus forming an artistic conception.</p><p></p><p>This is an extremely profound process.</p><p></p><p>The moment he obtained the insight of the Tyrant King, Ye Xiao's body rapidly emanated waves of pure golden light, and immediately after, the surrounding spiritual energy began to surge into his body endlessly.</p><p></p><p>The Tyrant King was stunned.</p><p></p><p>"This kid, he actually comprehended it in an instant? How is that possible?"</p><p></p><p>It must be known that even for an existence with extraordinary talent, obtaining the insight of the Emperor's Realm, it would be impossible to comprehend the strength of an Emperor Realm expert in an instant.</p><p></p><p>It requires continuous meditation, constant refinement and polishing, at least a year or a year and a half of time, or at the very least, if Ye Xiao's talent was heaven-defying, it would still take a few months.</p><p></p><p>After all, when he himself obtained the insight of the Emperor's Realm from his father, it took him a full three months to successfully break through to the Emperor Realm expert.</p><p></p><p>But Ye Xiao, he actually directly penetrated it in an instant, the speed so fast that it made him find it hard to believe, directly refreshing his worldview.</p><p></p><p>He immediately unleashed his divine sense to carefully scan Ye Xiao's figure.</p><p></p><p>Crack!</p><p></p><p>"This, this is, this... how is this possible? Am I hallucinating?"</p><p></p><p>When he saw that Ye Xiao's blood inside his body had completely transformed into divine blood, he was completely dumbfounded, and the wine cup in his hand also fell to the ground.</p><p></p><p>Fortunately, the wine cup was made of bronze, otherwise, it would have cracked with this fall! It must be known that for the human race to completely activate all the blood in their body, there was only one way, they must cultivate to the Divine Realm to complete it! But Ye Xiao, what realm was he in now? He was only at the half-step Emperor Realm, which was actually the King Realm.</p><p></p><p>When did the King Realm also have the ability to activate the entire divine blood? But after rubbing his eyes hard and confirming it several times, he finally completely believed what he had seen.</p><p></p><p>Ye Xiao, since he really activated his entire divine blood with his King Realm strength.</p><p></p><p>At this moment, the originally unrestrained and carefree Tyrant King suddenly became excited, his breathing even unable to help but become a little rapid.</p><p></p><p>He paced back and forth in the pavilion, his gaze sometimes excited, sometimes shining with brilliance, like a madman.</p><p></p><p>"Since the ancestor of the human race, the Xuanyuan Clan, there has never been a person who could fully activate all their divine blood before reaching the Divine Realm.</p><p></p><p>Even like the second generation, whose divine blood was at ninety-nine percent, possessing countless dragon qi tempering their bodies, it was still the same.</p><p></p><p>But this child, has completely activated all his divine blood at the King Realm, this child is so monstrous? The ancestor of the human race, the Xuanyuan Clan, once left behind a prophecy, they placed the hope of breaking through that mystery in the human bloodline, and in the future, in a certain generation, there will be a descendant of the human race who will break through the bloodline restriction and complete what they failed to do that year.</p><p></p><p>And this child, could he be the child of destiny?</p><p></p><p>Could it be that this child of destiny is the one in front of me?"</p><p></p><p>The Tyrant King paced back and forth, as if he had discovered a new continent, excited to the point of being unable to control himself.</p><p></p><p>When Ye Xiao first arrived, he had no hope at all, he simply treated him as a junior of the human race who wanted to take advantage of him.</p><p></p><p>To the Ye Xiao of that time, the Tyrant King only saw him as a very casual junior of the human race, and as long as he gave him a little benefit and sent him away, he would not have wronged him.</p><p></p><p>The Tyrant King had no hope at all for him, not even a bit of hope! Not at all!</p><p></p><p>But now, the Tyrant King's thoughts had completely changed.</p><p></p><p>Ye Xiao was very likely the ancestor of the human race, the child of destiny spoken of in the legend of the Xuanyuan Clan.</p><p></p><p>He must find a way to lend Ye Xiao a helping hand no matter what.</p><p></p><p>He must let Ye Xiao go further, break through to the Divine Realm, and then unravel the mystery hidden in the world of the human race.</p><p></p><p>Thinking of this, the Tyrant King made a momentous decision.</p><p></p><p>He was going to offer all the divine blood he had preserved for three thousand years to Ye Xiao!</p><p></p><p>He wanted to see, whether this child, was really the child of destiny spoken of in the legends? Whether he could create a miracle? Complete the unfinished goal of the ancestor of the human race, and penetrate that earth-shattering mystery!</p>

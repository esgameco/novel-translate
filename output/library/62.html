        <h1>Chapter 62</h1>
        <div class="content">
            <p>Here is the full English translation of the Chinese excerpt:</p><p></p><p>Early the next morning, Ye Xiao finished his breakfast and took Huan Liuli to work.</p><p></p><p>Along the way, Huan Liuli kept asking questions.</p><p></p><p>"Master, I feel like something is a bit off with me."</p><p></p><p>"What's the problem?"</p><p></p><p>"I feel like my body has been massaged all over, and I feel so refreshed!"</p><p></p><p>"I don't know, maybe it's because you slept well yesterday?"</p><p></p><p>In fact, the補天術 (Heavenly Restoration Technique) not only could repair new injuries, but if used for a prolonged period, it could also mend old injuries.</p><p></p><p>The hidden injuries Huan Liuli suffered in her early years had all been repaired.</p><p></p><p>To put it bluntly, it was like a eunuch becoming a real man overnight! Years of disability were instantly restored to normalcy.</p><p></p><p>The old, withered man had regained his youthful vigor!</p><p></p><p>While there were healing techniques in this world, they were limited.</p><p></p><p>Because the cultivation level of this world had its limits and could not catch up to the level of the Heavenly Restoration Technique synthesized by Ye Xiao.</p><p></p><p>Many people with severed limbs or severe injuries could be repaired using high-level healing techniques if treated promptly.</p><p></p><p>But if too much time had passed and no superior-level healer intervened, it would be too late.</p><p></p><p>In reality, superior-level healers were scarce, and even mid to low-level healers could only handle minor injuries, let alone severe ones. The medical standards of this world were only slightly more advanced than Ye Xiao's previous life, far from reaching the level of his Heavenly Restoration Technique.</p><p></p><p>Suddenly, a cry came from ahead.</p><p></p><p>"There's been an accident up ahead!"</p><p></p><p>Ye Xiao scanned with his spiritual sense and found that a dump truck had collided with a public bus, causing an explosion and trapping many people.</p><p></p><p>However, many martial artists quickly rushed to the rescue, and together they swiftly pulled out the truck driver and the bus driver and passengers.</p><p></p><p>An elderly man, leading the charge, smashed the tempered glass with his fists, heedless of the blood streaming from his hands, and rescued several children.</p><p></p><p>This was not only because many were martial artists who had cultivated the martial arts and were thus more courageous, but also because the people of this world were more united.</p><p></p><p>Perhaps it was because they had been constantly threatened by the beast attacks, the people here had learned to band together for warmth.</p><p></p><p>Compared to his previous life, this world was less safe but more warm, which made Ye Xiao feel very comfortable.</p><p></p><p>By the time Ye Xiao arrived, the passengers had already been rescued, though many were injured.</p><p></p><p>"Is there a healer? Who is a healer?"</p><p></p><p>"I am!"</p><p></p><p>"Me too!"</p><p></p><p>"I'm a student, but I've learned healing techniques."</p><p></p><p>Several people who knew healing techniques quickly stepped forward to treat the injured.</p><p></p><p>Ye Xiao also approached a woman holding a young boy. The boy's arm and knee were scraped, and he was crying silently, seemingly afraid to worry his mother.</p><p></p><p>Ye Xiao squatted down, gently patted the boy's head, and smiled, activating his healing technique. Soon, the boy's injuries were repaired.</p><p></p><p>"Mom, it doesn't hurt anymore."</p><p></p><p>The woman rubbed his little head.</p><p></p><p>"Then quickly thank the uncle."</p><p></p><p>"Thank you, uncle."</p><p></p><p>Ye Xiao nodded.</p><p></p><p>"You're welcome, you're a brave little man."</p><p></p><p>He then went on to treat the other injured people.</p><p></p><p>He worked quickly, and after healing someone, he would swiftly leave without much conversation, keeping a low profile.</p><p></p><p>The elderly man who had smashed his fist to break the glass was sitting by the roadside not far away, his hand still bleeding. Ye Xiao approached him.</p><p></p><p>"Let me take a look at that for you."</p><p></p><p>The old man waved his hand.</p><p></p><p>Here is the full English translation of the Chinese excerpt:</p><p></p><p>"Let the children see it first, so they don't miss anything. I'm an old man now, I can take a look later." </p><p></p><p>"No problem, most of the injured have been treated."</p><p></p><p>With that, Ye Xiao squatted down directly, lifting the old man's hand. The old man's hand was trembling, not only was the flesh and skin broken, but two of his finger bones were also shattered.</p><p></p><p>"The injury is quite severe."</p><p></p><p>"What's this? Back in the battlefield, my intestines were torn out by the star beasts."</p><p></p><p>Ye Xiao was slightly taken aback.</p><p></p><p>"A veteran?"</p><p></p><p>"From the Seventh Legion, I've been a soldier for over thirty years. If it weren't for this old body of mine being injured, I'd still be on the battlefield killing star beasts."</p><p></p><p>Ye Xiao stood up respectfully and said while treating him, "So you're from the Seventh Legion, I've long heard of your reputation."</p><p></p><p>The old man said with interest, "You know about the Seventh Legion?"</p><p></p><p>"The Seventh Legion is known as the 'God of War Legion', and its soldiers are called the 'Desperate Heroes'. Their combat prowess is the fiercest! Every year, their casualties in defending the Nine Provinces are the highest among all legions. It's said that every soldier of the Seventh Legion is covered in medals."</p><p></p><p>"It's not easy, there aren't many young people like you who know about this."</p><p></p><p>At this time, the other injured had all been healed, and the crowd around the healing mages were enthusiastically applauding.</p><p></p><p>Ye Xiao did not join the commotion, he simply stood up, smiled faintly, and turned to leave.</p><p></p><p>"You've recovered, I still have to go to work, so I'll be leaving first."</p><p></p><p>The old man was somewhat surprised.</p><p></p><p>"This young man, his character is quite extraordinary, he saved people but doesn't seek vain glory at all, he just left directly."</p><p></p><p>He clenched his fist and felt that his arm had recovered completely, couldn't help but smile lightly, "His healing skills are also quite good, he healed me so quickly, much stronger than an intermediate healer."</p><p></p><p>But he soon stopped smiling, because he felt a surge of profound spiritual energy flowing in his arm! "How is this possible?"</p><p></p><p>Years ago, he had suffered severe injuries on the battlefield and was not treated in time by a high-level healer, causing his meridians to wither and making it impossible for him to continue cultivating, so he had to retire from the battlefield. </p><p></p><p>It's been decades, according to reason, his meridians should be impossible to recover, so how could this happen? He punched a specially made brick that was as strong as bulletproof glass in front of him.</p><p></p><p>Boom! With an explosive sound, the brick was instantly shattered, and his fist was completely unharmed.</p><p></p><p>The old man was completely stunned.</p><p></p><p>Just now when he broke the car window, his finger bones were shattered, but now he was unharmed, all because there was spiritual energy defending his body.</p><p></p><p>He was really healed! The decades-old hidden injury had been cured at this moment? It was that young man! </p><p></p><p>It must be him! Is he a high-level healer? Heavens, Jianghai City actually has a high-level healer.</p><p></p><p>But what did he look like again? The old man couldn't remember. The distant Ye Xiao just smiled slightly.</p><p></p><p>The appearance of the person he healed has been erased by the Taixuan Tiangong. </p><p></p><p>He healed the other party because he was a hero, and heroes should not be forgotten, every hero is the glory of the Nine Provinces and should be treated well.</p><p></p><p>But he also has to prevent his own identity from being exposed.</p><p></p><p>After all, the principle of self-preservation cannot be violated, right?</p><p></p><p>(This chapter ends)</p>

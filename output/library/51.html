        <h1>Chapter 51</h1>
        <div class="content">
            <p>Here is the full English translation of the Chinese excerpt:</p><p></p><p>"The first matter is about the expansion of the library. This is supported by the funding from above. On the one hand, it is to make up for the previous losses of our library, and on the other hand, it is also to enhance the influence of our Jianghai City Library."</p><p></p><p>Ye Xiao in the crowd pondered slightly.</p><p></p><p>The library is the foundation of a city. A city can do without a martial arts academy, but it cannot do without a library.</p><p></p><p>This is because the martial arts academy is only for selecting and training the stronger students, with specialized martial arts experts, and then sending them to the front line.</p><p></p><p>While the library can not only allow the students of the martial arts academy to study, but also allow ordinary people to learn, with the widest compatibility, which can be said to be the foundation of the entire population's martial arts cultivation.</p><p></p><p>Generally speaking, the scale of a martial arts library is strictly formulated according to the scale of a city.</p><p></p><p>If a martial arts library is to be expanded, does it mean that this city also needs to be expanded? Ye Xiao often reads books on history and geography.</p><p></p><p>At present, the distribution of large and small cities in the Nine States is quite reasonable, and the Nine States have no need to rashly make changes to a city.</p><p></p><p>Could it be that some kind of pressure has been received, so that a large city has to be added?</p><p></p><p>Or, to gather the population of the surrounding small cities together to form a large city? Thinking carefully, it has been more than fifty years since the last beast disaster, right?</p><p></p><p>Ye Xiao's brow furrowed a bit tightly.</p><p></p><p>Because if his conjecture is true, then the problem would be very serious.</p><p></p><p>The beast disaster will produce extremely powerful star beasts, whose strength may even reach the level of the Divine Ancestor.</p><p></p><p>Although he can kill enemies by surpassing his level, he is not yet clear about the limit of his own abilities.</p><p></p><p>What if he can't defeat the Divine Ancestor?</p><p></p><p>Then it's all over.</p><p></p><p>If that's the case, then reading an extra hour of books every day may not be enough.</p><p></p><p>It seems that he needs to add another half an hour.</p><p></p><p>"Manager Ye, Manager Ye."</p><p></p><p>While Ye Xiao was deep in thought, Ning Yuhen next to him stretched out his arm and poked his elbow, pulling him back to the present.</p><p></p><p>He looked up at the crowd, and they were all staring at him, causing him to be startled. He then immediately activated the Taixuan Tiangong technique to directly extract the memories of the crowd, and then he understood what was going on.</p><p></p><p>The library expansion, combined with Yang Zhengyi's theft of the Aier King's map and the killing of several elderly librarians, has now made the library urgently in need of adding management personnel.</p><p></p><p>Someone like Ye Xiao naturally became one of the candidates.</p><p></p><p>The other managers also have the qualifications.</p><p></p><p>And now, it is his turn to give an election speech.</p><p></p><p>Ye Xiao cleared his throat and walked up to the stage under the gaze of the crowd, simply saying:</p><p></p><p>"Thank you all and the director for your trust, but I personally feel that I am still young, and the other seniors are more experienced in work and better at organizing activities, so I will not embarrass myself."</p><p></p><p>Nodding slightly, Ye Xiao then walked back down the stage under the puzzled gazes of the crowd.</p><p></p><p>Ouyang Yunzhong looked a bit surprised at Ye Xiao's back, as if he didn't expect Ye Xiao to be so carefree.</p><p></p><p>This kid, his temperament is extraordinary.</p><p></p><p>It's just a pity that he hasn't awakened his divine soul, otherwise he would definitely be quite good in the martial arts path.</p><p></p><p>But the election must go on.</p><p></p><p>"Ahem, Ye Xiao has finished, next is Wang Na."</p><p></p><p>The lady killer Wang Jie was not as polite as Ye Xiao, going straight up and directly thanking the director and everyone, with each thank-you bow causing her neckline to drop, revealing two pure white mountains that made countless men's breathing almost freeze.</p><p></p><p>Don't look, you can't resist.</p><p></p><p>Here is the full English translation of the Chinese excerpt:</p><p></p><p>"Look, I'm a bit embarrassed.</p><p></p><p>If Gu Hai were here, he might have already whistled.</p><p></p><p>Ning Yuheng couldn't help but quietly ask:</p><p></p><p>"Manager Ye, why don't you run for the position? If you win, wouldn't a promotion and raise be great? You'd probably become the director then, right?"</p><p></p><p>Ye Xiao shook his head.</p><p></p><p>"Not interested." There are only three director positions, but there are eight or nine people running for them.</p><p></p><p>As for Wang Na, I imagine the entire library, except for myself and Ning Yuheng by my side, has somehow been under her influence to some extent.</p><p></p><p>She is a woman standing atop countless peaks!</p><p></p><p>Even if she's lying down, her popularity is still greater than others.</p><p></p><p>Too many people are against her, so if she doesn't go up, it would be unacceptable!</p><p></p><p>Among the remaining candidates, one is the director's junior, who has been recommended. His speech is just a formality.</p><p></p><p>In other words, there is only one position left.</p><p></p><p>The competition is too fierce! Ye Xiao doesn't feel like competing with them for the position.</p><p></p><p>Moreover, even if he gets it, what's the point? A little more salary, but more things to manage, having to attend meetings every day, convey the spirit of the leadership's meetings, and take the lead in dealing with the troubles. </p><p></p><p>It's foolish to give up the prime of one's youth for an extra one or two thousand.</p><p></p><p>A look of admiration appeared on Ning Yuheng's face.</p><p></p><p>No wonder he admires Manager Ye the most, being so indifferent to promotion and raise. </p><p></p><p>Such detached people are too few nowadays.</p><p></p><p>Having someone like him who doesn't care about fame and fortune, who is not greedy, will definitely make a good leader.</p><p></p><p>Decided, I'll vote for him!</p><p></p><p>After Ye Xiao's speech, he began to space out again, waiting for the meeting to end so he could go back and read.</p><p></p><p>But the result left him dumbfounded.</p><p></p><p>The first two predictions were correct, one was Wang Na, the other was the director's junior.</p><p></p><p>But the third one was him!</p><p></p><p>When this result came out, Ye Xiao's expression was like this - (a blank expression).</p><p></p><p>Full of bewilderment and confusion.</p><p></p><p>Is there something wrong with these people's brains? I said it very clearly, I don't want to be the director, being a manager is enough, just reading books every day, improving myself, isn't that great? I should refuse, being an official is too much trouble, too many hassles.</p><p></p><p>Ye Xiao has always been a person who doesn't like trouble.</p><p></p><p>Ouyang Zhongxun looked at Ye Xiao and smiled.</p><p></p><p>"It seems that little Ye is quite popular among everyone. Since that's the case, I think the third director position should be taken by you.</p><p></p><p>Furthermore, after the library reform, the director's salary level will also be correspondingly increased, exceeding 10,000 per month.</p><p></p><p>Starting from this month."</p><p></p><p>Ye Xiao: "_." (a speechless expression)</p><p></p><p>Maybe I should try it for a few days first, and if I really can't do it, then I can choose to refuse.</p><p></p><p>After all, five thousand is not just one or two thousand, I should give it a little face.</p><p></p><p>"Today's meeting is over, if anyone has any questions, you can raise them now."</p><p></p><p>"No!"</p><p></p><p>Ye Xiao shouted along with the others, and Ouyang Zhongxun nodded in satisfaction.</p><p></p><p>"Okay, in that case, go to your respective areas, the workers will come to move the books later, you are responsible for directing the placement of the books and doing a detailed inventory, don't get it wrong."</p><p></p><p>"Yes!"</p><p></p><p>Chapter 3, new book, please support.</p><p></p><p>Thank you to reader 20201202004636366 for the donation, greatly appreciated.</p><p></p><p>(End of this chapter)</p>

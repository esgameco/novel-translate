        <h1>Chapter 25</h1>
        <div class="content">
            <p>Here is the full English translation of the Chinese excerpt:</p><p></p><p>Piao Jiansheng accepted the challenge, which was the first non-sword art challenge he had received since arriving in the Nine Provinces. Perhaps it was out of curiosity, or perhaps he was inspired by the determination in Qin Yueyan's eyes.</p><p></p><p>He felt that he could accept this battle.</p><p></p><p>Captain Jin's face was cold as he said:</p><p></p><p>"Piao Jiansheng, don't mess around. If it's not about the sword art, it will increase the difficulty of defeating your opponent. If you lose, it will be a huge blemish on your record in the Nine Provinces."</p><p></p><p>Piao Jiansheng's eyes were resolute as he said:</p><p></p><p>"A true master of the sword art does not fear the rules, nor does he fear any martial art! If my sword can only contend in the sword art, wouldn't that be a joke?"</p><p></p><p>"If you lose, you'll be fully responsible!"</p><p></p><p>"I know."</p><p></p><p>Piao Jiansheng picked up the iron sword, signaling that the battle had officially begun.</p><p></p><p>"Thank you," Qin Yueyan said gratefully, then quickly unsheathed an unopened longsword.</p><p></p><p>Seeing this, Old Master Qin was so angry that his mustache bristled and his eyes bulged.</p><p></p><p>"That damned girl, she actually went behind my back to secretly learn the sword art! Is she trying to let the Qin family's incense burner go out? After she comes down, if I don't beat her to death, I'll take her surname."</p><p></p><p>Du Changfeng tried to persuade him with a wry smile: "Old Qin, you need to change your way of thinking. The Qin family's sword art is not the strongest in the world, and the sword art is not the strongest martial art in the world! If the child has a better path, wouldn't that be better?"</p><p></p><p>"What bullshit! With my guidance in the sword art, what can she cultivate in the sword art?"</p><p></p><p>"Let's just wait and see."</p><p></p><p>On the stage, the two had suppressed their cultivation to below the Fifth-Grade Martial Artist level, so as not to destroy the martial arts hall or injure the audience.</p><p></p><p>Many people had already taken out their phones to record, waiting to upload it to the forum.</p><p></p><p>The two stood in opposition, and the entire hall had become so quiet that you could hear a pin drop.</p><p></p><p>But the gunpowder-like tension in the air was gradually thickening.</p><p></p><p>One second! Two seconds!</p><p></p><p>Three seconds!</p><p></p><p>Finally, Qin Yueyan moved.</p><p></p><p>She had not yet fully grasped the sword intent of Ye Xiao's move, because she could not cultivate her spiritual body like Ye Xiao. It might take her years, or even decades, to comprehend that move!</p><p></p><p>However, Ye Xiao's sword intent had allowed her to successfully enter the threshold of the sword art, and truly see the barrier of the Mahayana sword art!</p><p></p><p>Because of this, her cultivation had successfully broken through to the Sixth-Grade Martial Artist in just a few days. If she had cultivated the sword art, it might have taken her more than half a year to break through to the Sixth-Grade Martial Artist. This battle, she was confident.</p><p></p><p>Her right leg moved slightly, her body bent slightly, and Qin Yueyan's hand rested on the hilt of the sword.</p><p></p><p>Seeing this movement, Du Changfeng, who was persuading Qin Shenglong, suddenly stood up, his eyes serious as he stared intently at Qin Yueyan.</p><p></p><p>Qin Shenglong was startled.</p><p></p><p>"Old Du, what's wrong with you?"</p><p></p><p>Du Changfeng didn't respond to him, but just stared fixatedly at Qin Yueyan! Between experts, a single movement could reveal many clues.</p><p></p><p>Qin Yueyan's sword-drawing stance had actually revealed a glimpse of realm to him!</p><p></p><p>The next second, Qin Yueyan had already made her move.</p><p></p><p>Her foot stepped down, her body like a flying swallow, turning into a lightning bolt and arriving instantly beside Piao Jiansheng.</p><p></p><p>The originally only slightly serious-faced Piao Jiansheng had instantly become grave.</p><p></p><p>Whoosh - the iron sword was unsheathed, and the sword art was released in an instant.</p><p></p><p>Clang clang clang...</p><p></p><p>In the next second, their swords and sabers collided, and sparks flew on the stage!</p><p></p><p>"Good sword art!"</p><p></p><p>"Damn!"</p><p></p><p>Du Changfeng couldn't help but praise out loud, while Qin Shenglong was directly stunned, even blurting out a curse.</p><p></p><p>Here is the full English translation of the Chinese excerpt:</p><p></p><p>Her grandfather's eyes were filled with excitement.</p><p></p><p>"Old Shen, this time the Qin family is really going to produce a phoenix!"</p><p></p><p>Qin Shenglong took a deep breath, his eyes shining with excitement as he looked towards the arena.</p><p></p><p>Elder Chang Feng's status, even at the Imperial Capital Martial Arts Academy, was extremely high. Moreover, he was a specialist in the study of blade techniques.</p><p></p><p>Since he said so, then Language Yan...</p><p></p><p>On the arena, the fierce battle between Qin Yanyan and Peng Jiansheng did not have any warm-up, but directly entered a white-hot state.</p><p></p><p>The two figures on the vast arena stage were constantly flickering, leaving behind afterimages. The clashing of swords and blades, from the initial sparks to the final electric sparks, was deafening.</p><p></p><p>Within just one minute, the two had collided over three hundred times! The ringing sound of weapons clashing never ceased!</p><p></p><p>In the final second, the two gathered their full strength and collided again, actually unleashing a fierce gale, the shockwave dispersing and directly pushing the two back several steps, both gripping their weapons and panting heavily.</p><p></p><p>The martial arts hall fell silent for a few seconds, then suddenly erupted into thunderous applause.</p><p></p><p>"Good!"</p><p>"Spectacular!"</p><p>"With the strength of a Fifth-Grade Martial Artist, to fight so brilliantly, they are truly talented individuals."</p><p>"Not just that, they even unleashed a fierce gale! Absolutely amazing!"</p><p>"I've decided, from today on, Senior Qin will be my lifelong idol."</p><p></p><p>After catching their breath for a moment, their auras quickly stabilized.</p><p></p><p>Peng Jiansheng stood upright, a hint of admiration in his eyes.</p><p></p><p>The master was right, even though the Nine Provinces had been suppressed by many major regions over the past two hundred years, the Nine Provinces were still the Nine Provinces! Blessed with talented heroes!</p><p></p><p>"Although you use blade techniques, in the time since I entered the Nine Provinces, no one on your level has been able to match you. You are worthy of my earnest attention, Peng Jiansheng!"</p><p></p><p>"I couldn't ask for more!" Qin Yanyan's gaze was resolute.</p><p></p><p>Just as Ye Xiao had said, whether it was the sword dao or the blade techniques, one must forge ahead without hesitation!</p><p></p><p>The two once again gathered the spiritual energy within their bodies, their powers rapidly coalescing. Everyone knew that the next clash would determine the victor! Time seemed to slow down, the audience's heartbeats like a countdown, each thump representing the flow of time.</p><p></p><p>Finally, the two made their move again! But this time, Peng Jiansheng struck first. Elder Chang Feng's eyes narrowed slightly.</p><p></p><p>"It's the signature technique of Sword Saint Liu Chengxun - Peerless Sword! I didn't expect him to have learned this move as well. But he's never used this technique in the Imperial Capital, I didn't expect him to use it here."</p><p></p><p>Qin Shenglong could also see that Peng Jiansheng's move was extraordinary.</p><p></p><p>"Elder Chang, can Yanyan withstand that sword?"</p><p></p><p>Elder Chang gripped the edge of the table in front of him, even crushing the wooden edge to powder.</p><p></p><p>"I don't know, but if she wins, she will be renowned throughout the Nine Provinces from this day on. Even if she can't defeat it, the fact that she has pushed Peng Jiansheng to this point is enough!"</p><p></p><p>Qin Shenglong's heartbeat couldn't help but quicken, his eyes wide, staring intently at his granddaughter, not daring to blink, afraid of missing this spectacular battle.</p><p></p><p>"Daughter, fight on!"</p>

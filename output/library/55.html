        <h1>Chapter 55</h1>
        <div class="content">
            <p>Here is the full English translation of the Chinese excerpt:</p><p></p><p>Normally, humans and star beasts are two completely different races.</p><p></p><p>But there are inevitably some unexpected incidents that occur.</p><p></p><p>For example, if a human has a wild idea, or a star beast is in a particularly good mood, then some indescribable things may happen.</p><p></p><p>Just like in the past, when Ye Xiao was undergoing chemotherapy in the hospital, he saw a divorced woman who, out of curiosity, or perhaps because she hadn't eaten meat for too long, did something unmentionable.</p><p></p><p>Well, in the end, the doctor had to anesthetize the puppy and use a knife to remove the Teddy's thing to resolve the situation.</p><p></p><p>But there is a very serious problem - star beasts and wild beasts are two different concepts.</p><p></p><p>Star beasts and humans can both cultivate spiritual energy, so there is a certain probability that there will be no reproductive isolation! That means there may be beings born with half human bloodline and half star beast bloodline.</p><p></p><p>These beings are seen as taboo by humans.</p><p></p><p>Of course, in Ye Xiao's view, it is humans who are afraid and jealous, feeling that the other party's innate talents are too strong.</p><p></p><p>It is said that the cultivation methods of humans were obtained from the star beasts.</p><p></p><p>Because star beasts have the innate talent of communicating with the spiritual energy of heaven and earth, their bloodline even contains special innate abilities.</p><p></p><p>Human cultivation techniques were learned from these special abilities.</p><p></p><p>But humans are still humans, they need to rely on cultivating techniques to gain cultivation.</p><p></p><p>While those with star beast bloodline do not need to cultivate, they can directly activate the innate talents in their bloodline, and automatically operate their innate techniques, thereby achieving self-cultivation.</p><p></p><p>In addition, the star beast bloodline is also more easily able to absorb spiritual energy than humans.</p><p></p><p>It is said that this is also the reason why there have been many incidents of humans and star beasts in history.</p><p></p><p>However, later people found that having star beast bloodline, although it's quite good and can quickly improve one's strength, also has a huge hidden danger.</p><p></p><p>That is, the half-beasts will have half-beast nature, which is very difficult to control.</p><p></p><p>Once out of control, combined with their understanding of human habits, the destruction they can cause is even greater than that of pure star beasts! So the half-beasts gradually became a taboo existence.</p><p></p><p>Ning Yuhen patted the little cat.</p><p></p><p>"Little one, you can't be naughty anymore in the future, you must be careful when crossing the road."</p><p></p><p>"Meow~."</p><p></p><p>The little cat licked Ning Yuhen's hand a few times, then hopped and jumped into the nearby bushes.</p><p></p><p>Ning Yuhen stood up and looked at Ye Xiao, his little face blushing slightly again.</p><p></p><p>This guy... is really... to die for.</p><p></p><p>"Manager, am I... too unmanly?"</p><p></p><p>At this time the traffic light on the zebra crossing had turned green, Ye Xiao shifted his gaze, put his hands in his pockets, and continued walking towards the library.</p><p></p><p>"It's fine, after all you haven't said 'it's cool' after eating a peach."</p><p></p><p>Ning Yuhen quickly walked up.</p><p></p><p>"Thank you, manager. I know I'm very feminine, although I don't know why I am this way, but the manager has never mocked me or bullied me, I'm really grateful."</p><p></p><p>"Giving others respect is a very normal thing, you don't need to be grateful to me."</p><p></p><p>Ning Yuhen's smile had a slight bitterness.</p><p></p><p>"That's what they say, but when a person has suffered too much harm, even a little bit of warmth becomes a big thing to be grateful for to the point of tears."</p><p></p><p>Ye Xiao glanced at him, it seems this guy has quite a story.</p><p></p><p>Thinking about it, with such a weak personality and good looks, he must have been bullied by both men and women, right? But Ye Xiao was not interested in this, what he was interested in was the healing technique that Ning Yuhen had just demonstrated.</p><p></p><p>That should be a basic healing technique that he possesses due to his star beast bloodline.</p><p></p><p>Here is the full English translation of the Chinese excerpt:</p><p></p><p>I've been searching in the library for so long, but I still couldn't find this fundamental healing technique. The last hope should be on Ning Yuhen.</p><p></p><p>But how should I obtain this healing art? Utilize my leadership position and powerful strength to forcefully seize it? Or use the Taixuan Tiangong to directly scan his memories?</p><p></p><p>However, Ye Xiao's moral standards are not that shattered yet. He is a normal person who has received good social education and cultivation. Bullying the weak is not in his nature, nor is it what a man should do. Moreover, since Ning Yuhen has been diligently and loyally working in the library, it would be too beastly of me to forcefully take his thing.</p><p></p><p>Should I use other things to exchange it? For example, teach him a couple of self-defense techniques against wolves? Although the self-defense techniques are usually learned by women, Ning Yuhen might still need them, right? Okay, I've decided, I'll find an appropriate opportunity in the afternoon to have a good talk with him.</p><p></p><p>In the afternoon at work, everything went as usual.</p><p></p><p>Ye Xiao continued reading books, while Ning Yuhen was inputting the library archives into the computer.</p><p></p><p>After a whole afternoon of busy work, Ning Yuhen stretched and finally finished.</p><p></p><p>The sound of the clock signaling the end of the workday rang, and at the same time, a cup of steaming hot coffee was gently placed in front of him.</p><p></p><p>Ning Yuhen was startled, seeing Ye Xiao's smiling face, and immediately stood up.</p><p></p><p>"Manager Ye."</p><p></p><p>"No need to be nervous, sit down."</p><p></p><p>Ning Yuhen sat down with some trepidation, not knowing what Ye Xiao wanted to do.</p><p></p><p>He stole a glance at Ye Xiao.</p><p></p><p>So handsome! </p><p></p><p>If his own beauty is universally appealing to both men and women, then Ye Xiao's handsomeness is lethal to all, young and old!</p><p></p><p>Moreover, with Manager Ye standing above him, looking down, it adds an aura of dominance.</p><p></p><p>I really wish I could be a man like Manager Ye, so handsome and masculine.</p><p></p><p>"Little Ning, how have I been treating you?"</p><p></p><p>"Manager Ye has always been good to me."</p><p></p><p>"Truly?"</p><p></p><p>Ning Yuhen solemnly nodded.</p><p></p><p>"Good! Then I want to make a deal with you. Of course, even if you don't want to make a deal, it's fine, it's entirely up to you, no need to feel any psychological burden."</p><p></p><p>After saying that, Ye Xiao pushed the coffee towards him.</p><p></p><p>Ning Yuhen nodded vaguely, picked up the coffee, and took a sip.</p><p></p><p>"What does the manager want to say?"</p><p></p><p>"I want to learn your healing technique. Of course, I won't learn it for free, as an exchange, I will teach you a very good technique, and I won't let you be at a disadvantage."</p><p></p><p>At these words, Ning Yuhen's expression became solemn and flustered.</p><p></p><p>He glanced at Ye Xiao with some guilt.</p><p></p><p>"Manager... why are you interested in my healing technique?"</p><p></p><p>"I've been studying healing techniques recently, and I haven't seen the one you have, so I'm a bit curious."</p><p></p><p>"This... this technique is a family secret, generally not allowed to be taught to outsiders. I... I'll think about it."</p><p></p><p>After saying that, Ning Yuhen immediately ran away quickly, not even finishing the rest of the coffee.</p><p></p><p>This made Ye Xiao raise his eyebrows slightly.</p><p></p><p>It seems this technique is really important to Ning Yuhen.</p><p></p><p>Thinking about it carefully, it's likely related to his beast bloodline. If it's passed on, it could be fatal to him.</p><p></p><p>So even if he's willing, he probably doesn't dare to casually teach it to me.</p><p></p><p>It seems I didn't consider this carefully enough.</p><p></p><p>One more update, please recommend.</p><p></p><p>Thank you to book friend 3-year-old brother for the reward, greatly appreciated.</p><p></p><p>(This chapter is complete)</p>

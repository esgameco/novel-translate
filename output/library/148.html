        <h1>Chapter 148</h1>
        <div class="content">
            <p>Here is the full English translation of the Chinese excerpt:</p><p></p><p>Since ancient times, on this land of the Nine Provinces, a dazzling martial arts culture has been bred.</p><p></p><p>It has also given birth to countless extraordinary masters who have amazed the long river of time, like immortal deities.</p><p></p><p>They are all the glory of the Nine Provinces.</p><p></p><p>Even after a thousand years, they remain the most brilliant brushstrokes in the historical civilization of the Nine Provinces.</p><p></p><p>And now, the legends continue.</p><p></p><p>The Sword Emperor Blue Dragon, ranked first on the World Dragon Ranking! The Fire Saber Vermilion Bird, ranked first on the World Phoenix Ranking!</p><p></p><p>As well as the Sword Saint Lu Qingshan before us, they are all the glory of the Nine Provinces.</p><p></p><p>It is because of them that the Nine Provinces have been able to successfully resist so many beast disasters over the past two hundred years, and also resist the top experts of the barbarians.</p><p></p><p>Otherwise, the brilliant martial arts civilization of the Nine Provinces would have long been stolen by those covetous villains.</p><p></p><p>Now, to be able to witness the venerable appearance of Lu Qingshan, a true powerhouse, is truly a life without regrets.</p><p></p><p>"Sword Saint senior, the few Celestial Beast Star Beasts have just escaped, and they have not yet harmed the innocent. The intention of the Nine Provinces is that we hope you can go there as soon as possible to prevent them from harming the innocent."</p><p></p><p>Lu Qingshan nodded.</p><p></p><p>"I understand, you can go back and report. Those few Star Beasts, I will take care of them."</p><p></p><p>As he spoke, Lu Qingshan's avatar instantly transformed into a sword beam and disappeared into the clouds.</p><p></p><p>His main body also vanished without a trace.</p><p></p><p>Just as he had come quietly, he also left quietly, without taking away a single gust of wind or a wisp of cloud, silently.</p><p></p><p>Lu Qingshan's disciple Xian'er also turned and left the sword path.</p><p></p><p>The messenger could not help but sigh.</p><p></p><p>"Is this the power of the Sword Saint senior? It's really too strong! I, a proud Innate Second-Grade Sect Master, can be considered a minor achievement. Compared to the Sword Saint, I'm no better than an ant."</p><p></p><p>But he soon started laughing happily.</p><p></p><p>Because the Sword Saint is a person of the Nine Provinces, and he is also a person of the Nine Provinces, isn't this a great honor?</p><p></p><p>If the Sword Saint were from another province, he would have wanted to cry.</p><p></p><p>On the other side, Ye Xiao was walking home from the city area after finishing his meal. His expression was not very happy.</p><p></p><p>Ever since he had eaten the meat of the Star Beasts before, he often found the ordinary dishes to be lacking in taste.</p><p></p><p>Especially the meat of the Celestial Beast-level Star Beasts.</p><p></p><p>Whether it was the Aer King or Noel Fist, or even the Black Xuanwu Saint Envoy and the Black Scale Snake, they were all far better than these ordinary dishes.</p><p></p><p>The meat of the Celestial Beast-level Star Beasts was tender and crisp, and with each bite, not only was there the fresh and soft texture of the meat, but it also contained an extremely powerful blood qi and spiritual qi.</p><p></p><p>The burst of spiritual qi in the mouth, the sense of satisfaction, and the refreshing feeling that permeated the body were things that no dish could compare to.</p><p></p><p>This is probably also the reason why cultivators who have reached the Celestial Beast realm no longer enjoy eating ordinary food? Eating regular food can no longer satisfy the needs of the Celestial Beasts, so they might as well not eat at all.</p><p></p><p>This has also made Ye Xiao more determined to catch more Celestial Beast-level Star Beasts to eat. Not only can it satisfy his own appetite, but it can also eliminate the threat to humanity.</p><p></p><p>Speaking of which, he has always been puzzled by one problem.</p><p></p><p>Why don't Celestial Beasts eat food, and why hasn't their anus disappeared or degenerated?</p><p></p><p>According to normal biological evolution theory, if people don't eat, their digestive system should also become useless, right? Later, Ye Xiao came up with a reasonable explanation - the high-martial world itself is unreasonable, so the occasional unreasonable thing is also understandable.</p><p></p><p>Just as he had just finished pondering this question, he suddenly stopped in his tracks and looked up towards the rooftop in the distance.</p><p></p><p>There, a murderous intent was hidden, although it was well concealed, it could not escape his perception.</p><p></p><p>The Profound Heaven Divine Might was activated, instantly revealing her appearance.</p><p></p><p>A bewitching figure, wearing a feathered robe, it could only be Yifeng, who else could it be? As soon as he looked up, she had obviously also noticed him.</p><p></p><p>The remnant spiritual power of Noel Fist hidden under her feathered robe immediately cried out:</p><p></p><p>"It's him! It's him! It's that human!"</p><p></p><p>A cold light flashed in Yifeng's eyes.</p><p></p><p>"So it's this human. Noel Fist senior is waiting here, I'll go and kill him."</p><p></p><p>Noel Fist's spiritual power hurriedly spoke:</p><p></p><p>"No, no, don't act rashly. We just need to know that he is in Jianghai City. It's better to avoid the limelight and plan carefully.</p><p></p><p>What if you can't beat him? The Star Beast Clan's plan will be ruined."</p><p></p><p>Yifeng smiled slightly.</p><p></p><p>"Senior, you don't need to worry too much. You don't know my strength, which is understandable. I, Yifeng, have never been afraid of anyone in a one-on-one battle! Let alone he is just a human, even if he is also a Celestial Beast, he can't possibly defeat me.</p><p></p><p>And even if I can't kill him, escaping to save my life is not difficult.</p><p></p><p>Senior, just watch."</p><p></p><p>Noel Fist still wanted to say something, but Yifeng had already leapt down from the rooftop.</p><p></p><p>This made Noel Fist somewhat speechless.</p><p></p><p>Yifeng seems to have an excessive blind self-confidence.</p><p></p><p>The young Star Beasts these days are all so arrogant.</p><p></p><p>Here is the full English translation of the Chinese excerpt:</p><p></p><p>"Is that so?" he sighed. "What a pity, just when someone came to rescue me, now I have to send them away.</p><p></p><p>Who knows when a powerful star beast at the level of the Sage Emperor will come to save me next time. </p><p></p><p>I just hope Ye Xiao won't vent his anger on me.</p><p></p><p>But I shouldn't worry too much, after all, my spiritual consciousness is well hidden. As long as Ji Feng doesn't expose me, I shouldn't have any major problems."</p><p></p><p>"To actually be able to find my location, Noel Fis senior really is worthy of my vigilance."</p><p></p><p>Noel Fis: "Zzz (ÁÅ¨)!"</p><p></p><p>Ye Xiao looked at the other party, a hint of understanding in his gaze.</p><p></p><p>"I thought it was some random pest, but it turns out to be one of the Octopus's underlings."</p><p></p><p>This made Ye Xiao somewhat displeased.</p><p></p><p>This Noel Fis is a bit unscrupulous. He's already been sealed underground by Ye Xiao, yet he still dares to make these little moves, practically courting death.</p><p></p><p>It seems Ye Xiao needs to go have a talk with Noel Fis, and while he's at it, stab him a few times and get some octopus meat. </p><p></p><p>Ye Xiao is still craving the octopus meatballs and octopus stir-fry from before.</p><p></p><p>"How dare you casually address Senior Noel Fis's true form, human, you're courting death."</p><p></p><p>A murderous glint flashed in Ji Feng's eyes.</p><p></p><p>Among the star beasts, there was an unwritten rule that forbade anyone from casually discussing their true forms, just like how humans dislike others commenting on their looks, good or bad - it was an extremely disrespectful matter.</p><p></p><p>Ye Xiao had directly called the revered Noel Fis senior an octopus right in front of her, which was akin to cursing someone's idol as a stray dog.</p><p></p><p>However, just as she finished speaking, Ye Xiao's focus shifted from Noel Fis to her.</p><p></p><p>"A primordial seventh-grade Saint Monarch, your flesh should be quite delicious as well."</p><p></p><p>With that, Ye Xiao directly raised his hand and struck.</p><p></p><p>That seemingly gentle palm strike, the moment it was unleashed, rapidly expanded in Ji Feng's pupils.</p><p></p><p>Accompanying it was a massive pressure that Ji Feng was powerless to resist.</p><p></p><p>In an instant, Ji Feng felt as if she had become a tiny ant, utterly insignificant.</p><p></p><p>"Oh no!"</p><p></p><p>In that moment, she suddenly understood why Noel Fis senior had told her not to be so reckless.</p><p></p><p>This guy was no ordinary human Saint Monarch?</p><p></p><p>His cultivation, perhaps even Noel Fis's avatar wouldn't be able to defeat him.</p><p></p><p>"Senior Noel Fis, why didn't you tell me earlier? Why?" </p><p></p><p>Ji Feng's final thoughts were filled with boundless resentment.</p><p></p><p>She hated her own stupidity, and even more so, Noel Fis's deception! But this thought didn't even last a second, for the next moment, Ye Xiao's Tathagata Divine Palm had ruthlessly struck her.</p><p></p><p>Boom! A palm print larger than a truck slammed the thick cement ground three meters deep!</p><p></p><p>Dust and debris flew, stones shattered and scattered everywhere.</p><p></p><p>Ji Feng's true form was revealed - a mother hen over a meter tall.</p><p></p><p>Next to her was a broken eggshell, probably something she had involuntarily expelled in her last moment.</p><p></p><p>"So it's just an old hen, I'm in luck today, I was just craving some soup."</p><p></p><p>Ye Xiao's lips curled up as he directly used his storage ring to collect Ji Feng, then activated his divine will technique and vanished from the spot.</p><p></p><p>Nearby residents who had heard the commotion quickly poked their heads out the windows.</p><p></p><p>"What happened? What's going on?"</p><p></p><p>"My goodness, who made such a huge palm print on the street?"</p><p></p><p>"That's too terrifying, the power exceeds even that of a Sect Master!"</p><p></p><p>"Sect Master? You're underestimating it, that palm strike had the destructive force of at least a Grand Sect Master!"</p><p></p><p>On the rooftop, Noel Fis's spiritual consciousness shuddered violently.</p><p></p><p>"Damn it, this kid actually has such a terrifying palm technique? </p><p></p><p>It's definitely an imperial art! This kid, despite only being at the primordial seventh-grade, can instantly defeat his peers, he might even be able to fight beyond his level.</p><p></p><p>Good thing he didn't discover me, otherwise my divine consciousness would have been completely wiped out.</p><p></p><p>Now it seems his strength is far beyond my avatar's. </p><p></p><p>I can't rashly break the seal, I should cultivate more, a thousand years at least!</p><p></p><p>After a thousand years, I'll break the seal and reunite with my main body, it won't be too late then."</p><p></p><p>Sensing several auras rapidly approaching, he immediately turned and left, not lingering any further.</p><p></p><p>In truth, Ye Xiao had long since detected him. With the Profound Heaven Divine Gaze, who could hide from Ye Xiao's scan at such close range? Ye Xiao just planned to settle the score with Noel Fis privately, since today he wanted to have some old hen soup first.</p>

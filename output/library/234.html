        <h1>Chapter 234</h1>
        <div class="content">
            <p>Here is the full English translation of the Chinese excerpt:</p><p></p><p>"You are truly interesting. In all these years, apart from the original Nine Heavenly Sovereigns, I have not seen anyone else who can reach your level of human cultivation.</p><p></p><p>It seems I will have some fun today.</p><p></p><p>I hope you can give it your all, and not disappoint me too much."</p><p></p><p>Ye Xiao did not reply. To Azuo Shana, this battle might be an entertaining game.</p><p></p><p>But to Ye Xiao, it was not even a game.</p><p></p><p>Within the same realm, there were truly not many who could pique his interest.</p><p></p><p>Unwilling to waste more time, Ye Xiao took action directly.</p><p></p><p>He swung the Heavenly Slashing Sword, the sword qi surging like an azure dragon, piercing straight towards the heavens and directly at Azuo Shana.</p><p></p><p>"Well done."</p><p></p><p>Azuo Shana also swung his sword, the two sword qi intertwining with thunderous lightning, colliding with spiritual energy, and clashing in an instant.</p><p></p><p>Boom! A violent explosion resounded, and a mushroom cloud appeared in the sky.</p><p></p><p>But this explosion was just the beginning, like the sound of a starting gun.</p><p></p><p>The moment the explosion rang out, the two combatants vanished from their original positions.</p><p></p><p>"So fast!"</p><p></p><p>The onlookers couldn't help but exclaim in shock.</p><p></p><p>The speed of Ye Xiao and the other was truly too fast, even these Deity Sect experts could not keep up with them, completely unable to see their figures, only barely able to glimpse the countless afterimages flashing across the sky.</p><p></p><p>These were the luminous shadows left behind by their incredible speed.</p><p></p><p>Even Beitung Ce, a Primordial Ninth Grade cultivator with Demonic Eye techniques, was stunned and dumbfounded.</p><p></p><p>His Demonic Fire Spiritual Eyes were absolutely superior in terms of perception compared to ordinary Primordial Ninth Grade cultivators, but even for him, he could only see the afterimages, barely keeping up with their speed and vaguely tracking their positions. Beyond that, he could no longer make out their faces.</p><p></p><p>The next moment, a series of explosions suddenly erupted in the sky.</p><p></p><p>Each explosion represented one clash between the two, causing the onlookers' hearts to tremble.</p><p></p><p>Because upon careful counting, these explosions seemed to have reached tens of thousands in number!</p><p></p><p>How incredibly fast must their speed be? In just a few seconds? That they could reach such a level?</p><p></p><p>If they were given a full minute, wouldn't these two be able to defy the heavens?</p><p></p><p>Ten Middle State Cities would not be enough for them to wreak havoc!</p><p></p><p>Ten seconds later, the sky was completely clear, not a single wisp of cloud. The explosive golden light generated by their battle continued to flare up, even obscuring the sunlight above.</p><p></p><p>Finally, in the midst of the strongest explosion, the two combatants separated, each standing proudly in their own place.</p><p></p><p>At this point, the onlookers could finally discern the difference between the two.</p><p></p><p>Azuo Shana was already beginning to pant slightly, clearly the previous battle had almost reached his limit.</p><p></p><p>But Ye Xiao's expression remained calm and composed, completely unfazed.</p><p></p><p>Ye Xiao was actually stronger than Azuo Shana?</p><p></p><p>Heavens, Azuo Shana had already reached the Demigod Realm, a powerhouse on the verge of the King Realm.</p><p></p><p>Yet Ye Xiao was even stronger than him! Did that not mean Ye Xiao was infinitely close to that realm as well?</p><p></p><p>At this moment, the onlookers felt their very blood begin to boil.</p><p></p><p>The human race was about to produce another expert of such a caliber.</p><p></p><p>Blessed by the Heavens! Blessed by the Heavens! Beitung Ce's eyes even became slightly moist.</p><p></p><p>As an elder, he cared deeply about the future of the human race and the Nine States.</p><p></p><p>Now, a monstrous genius had appeared among their own, and he was genuinely overjoyed.</p><p></p><p>"In hundreds of years, the Nine States have produced another dragon!"</p><p></p><p>Azuo Shana looked at Ye Xiao, his eyes gleaming with a frenzied light.</p><p></p><p>Although he was a Stellar Beast, he was also a martial arts fanatic! The stronger Ye Xiao became, the more excited he grew.</p><p></p><p>He had already recovered his breath, the panting gone, and his face showed an excited expression as he looked at Ye Xiao.</p><p></p><p>"You should still have more power to unleash, right? Interesting, truly interesting! You not only cultivate the sword dao, but also many other martial arts! Including cultivation methods, you practice not just the Emperor Techniques, but more than one."</p><p></p><p>Truly worthy of being Azuo Shana, a powerhouse of such a level.</p><p></p><p>After their brief clash, he had quickly grasped Ye Xiao's techniques.</p><p></p><p>But this also made him realize that he still had a chance to win against Ye Xiao.</p><p></p><p>Ye Xiao was only stronger than him in terms of endurance, and the cultivation methods he practiced were also Emperor Techniques.</p><p></p><p>As long as he did not engage in a prolonged battle with Ye Xiao, but instead decided the outcome with a single move, this fight would be over.</p><p></p><p>"No need to dawdle, let's decide this with a single move!"</p><p></p><p>Ye Xiao naturally knew what he was planning, but he still nodded.</p><p></p><p>If one dares not slay the king, how can one become the king? Since he wanted to become a true expert, his mental state had to be strong enough.</p><p></p><p>If he couldn't even accept his opponent's challenge, wouldn't that be utterly ridiculous?</p><p></p><p>The most important thing in the martial dao was the state of one's mind.</p><p></p><p>If his mind faltered, his martial dao might stagnate forever. And who could guarantee that he would always have the upper hand?</p><p></p><p>Here is the full English translation of the Chinese excerpt:</p><p></p><p>Will he lose? No, he will definitely be the last one standing.</p><p></p><p>"Good! Myriad Swords Convergence!" Azuo suddenly bit his own finger, and in the next moment, his true form appeared in the air.</p><p></p><p>It was a towering and mighty sword dragon, like a mountain!</p><p></p><p>After transforming into his beast form, his aura was further enhanced, reaching an even stronger level.</p><p></p><p>And after his transformation, countless golden lights began to emanate from his body.</p><p></p><p>That was his innate supreme technique - Myriad Swords Convergence! He squeezed out the equivalent of his full power, a total of ten thousand sword attacks, and combined them into one.</p><p></p><p>This technique was capable of defeating enemies of a higher realm, meaning that with his current semi-divine beast cultivation, the power it unleashed would not be inferior to that of a divine beast.</p><p></p><p>When Myriad Swords Convergence was unleashed, the heavens and earth underwent unpredictable changes, and countless sword weapons on the ground began to tremble.</p><p></p><p>This terrifying sight made countless martial artists shudder in fear.</p><p></p><p>One second, two seconds, three seconds.</p><p></p><p>Finally, the charging of Myriad Swords Convergence was complete.</p><p></p><p>Roar! Accompanied by Azuo's earth-shattering roar, in the next moment, countless sword beams began to surge towards Yexiao.</p><p></p><p>Yexiao also made his move at this moment.</p><p></p><p>He used the Imperial Extreme Sword Technique!</p><p></p><p>Among all his techniques, only the Imperial Extreme Sword Technique was most suitable for dealing with Myriad Swords Convergence.</p><p></p><p>Because Myriad Swords Convergence is a sustained sword technique, while the Imperial Extreme Sword Technique is a continuously amplifying one.</p><p></p><p>Myriad Swords Convergence condenses ten thousand attacks into one point.</p><p></p><p>And the Imperial Extreme Sword Technique, each sword strike becomes stronger than the previous one.</p><p></p><p>However, Myriad Swords Convergence has ten thousand attacks, while the Imperial Extreme Sword Technique only has one hundred and eight attacks.</p><p></p><p>In this regard, the Imperial Extreme Sword Technique is at a certain disadvantage in confronting Myriad Swords Convergence.</p><p></p><p>But Yexiao is not a fool, in addition to the imperial techniques bestowed by the Golden Book Spiritual Consciousness, he has also developed some special techniques of his own.</p><p></p><p>For example, by combining the Imperial Extreme Sword Technique with the Heavenly Slash Sword.</p><p></p><p>Each attack of the Imperial Extreme Sword Technique is a Heavenly Slash Sword! This greatly increases the upper limit of the Imperial Extreme Sword Technique.</p><p></p><p>The fusion of the two, the power is limitless.</p><p></p><p>The sword techniques of the two collided the moment they were unleashed.</p><p></p><p>But they did not explode, but formed two opposing sword beams, firmly opposing each other, neither yielding.</p><p></p><p>Then, the subsequent sword attacks frantically rushed in, amplifying the previous sword beam.</p><p></p><p>The casting speed of the Imperial Extreme Sword Technique was clearly slower than that of Myriad Swords Convergence.</p><p></p><p>After the collision lasted for one second, the opposing line between the two began to move, moving towards Yexiao's side.</p><p></p><p>This meant that Yexiao's sword attacks had failed to withstand Myriad Swords Convergence.</p><p></p><p>Everyone's hearts were in their throats, if Yexiao lost, then all of them present, including the entire Zhongzhou City, would be annihilated today.</p><p></p><p>Yexiao's victory or defeat was directly related to the lives of all of them.</p><p></p><p>In the huge pupils of Azuo's sword dragon, a trace of crazy joy emerged.</p><p></p><p>The battle had just begun, and Yexiao was already unable to hold on, and there were still many more techniques of Myriad Swords Convergence to come, this battle was definitely his victory.</p><p></p><p>The sword beam was approaching Yexiao.</p><p></p><p>One thousand meters, eight hundred meters, five hundred meters, three hundred meters, at most in seven seconds, Yexiao would be dead for sure! Although Myriad Swords Convergence had already approached Yexiao, Yexiao's expression did not show the slightest panic, he still calmly unleashed his attacks.</p><p></p><p>The tenth strike, the eleventh strike, the twelfth strike... Each time he struck, the power would be stronger than the previous one.</p><p></p><p>When the sword beam reached the seven thousand seven hundred and forty-ninth strike, the situation finally began to turn around.</p><p></p><p>That sword beam, which had already come within ten meters of Yexiao, suddenly stopped!</p><p></p><p>The fiftieth strike!</p><p></p><p>Boom! The sword beam at the forefront of Myriad Swords Convergence was actually pushed back a step by Yexiao.</p><p></p><p>"Good!" </p><p></p><p>The crowd couldn't help but excitedly clench their fists and cheer.</p><p></p><p>Azuo was stunned, but soon his face turned cold as he used even greater power to drive Myriad Swords Convergence.</p><p></p><p>The speed of Myriad Swords Convergence was accelerated, and the power was even greater than before.</p><p></p><p>But even so, even though Yexiao was still calmly swinging each sword, the sword beams were constantly retreating towards him.</p><p></p><p>"No! No!" </p><p></p><p>Azuo finally started to panic.</p><p></p><p>Although he was a martial arts fanatic, it didn't mean he wasn't afraid of death.</p><p></p><p>He dared to fight Yexiao just now because he felt he wouldn't lose.</p><p></p><p>But now, he finally felt Yexiao's terrifying power.</p><p></p><p>He would lose! He would be killed! He began to fully drive Myriad Swords Convergence, unleashing all the remaining sword beams in an instant, fusing them into the forefront sword beam.</p><p></p><p>This sudden imbalance of spiritual energy directly caused the forefront sword beam to explode!</p>

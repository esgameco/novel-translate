        <h1>Chapter 211</h1>
        <div class="content">
            <p>Here is the full English translation of the Chinese excerpt:</p><p></p><p>It is said that the star beasts are all cultivators of the soul and body. As they grow older, their cultivation and spiritual power increase simultaneously.</p><p></p><p>It's not really the fault of the human race. The innate strength of humans is weak, so the first thing they need to do is to strengthen their own power in order to survive, and then consider upgrading to a higher level.</p><p></p><p>First, they should cultivate their spiritual energy and physical strength. After reaching the Ninth Rank of the Innate Realm, they can then focus on cultivating their spiritual power, thereby elevating their strength to the King Realm, which is safer for humans.</p><p></p><p>Otherwise, if humans cultivated their soul and body together like the star beasts, they might be able to reach the Divine Ancestor Realm in just a hundred years. But in reality, many people only reach the Divine Ancestor Realm after several hundred years.</p><p></p><p>This is simply not allowed given the human lifespan.</p><p></p><p>It seems that I should find a way to cultivate my spiritual power next.</p><p></p><p>The Taixuan Tiangong is for cultivating mental power, which is not the same as soul power.</p><p></p><p>Just like cultivation is not the same as physical strength.</p><p></p><p>Mental power is the power used by the soul, just like spiritual energy is the power used by the physical body.</p><p></p><p>So spiritual energy can harm the physical body, while mental power can harm the soul.</p><p></p><p>This is why only those at the Grand Master Realm or above, or those who specialize in mental cultivation techniques, can deal with the existence of ghosts and spirits.</p><p></p><p>"It seems that I should find a way to improve my soul power next."</p><p></p><p>After understanding the information about the King Realm, it was also time to get off work. The golden book within Ye Xiao had already cultivated the last claw technique to the Great Perfection Realm, emanating a faint golden glow.</p><p></p><p>He could go home and refine it now.</p><p></p><p>After punching out, Ye Xiao used the Divine Will Technique to instantly disappear from the spot and return home, beginning to refine the claw technique.</p><p></p><p>Activating the divine soul of the golden book, the pages recording the technique gradually merged into a few large characters:</p><p></p><p>Grab! Knead! Rub! Pinch! Squeeze! Clamp! Pinch! Pull! Press! These were some strange-sounding words, but they made sense since they were claw techniques, after all. The basic skills were nothing more than these methods.</p><p></p><p>Soon, the basic technique was refined into a brand-new imperial claw technique - the Star-Plucking Palm!</p><p></p><p>The Star-Plucking Palm can grab objects from a distance and kill people invisibly. As long as the cultivation is strong enough, it can capture people from hundreds, thousands, or even tens of thousands of miles away, as easily as reaching into a bag.</p><p></p><p>How powerful! It's practically an invincible control skill.</p><p></p><p>With this technique, even if the enemy runs far away, he can be instantly captured and brought back.</p><p></p><p>After mastering this technique, could he use it to remotely control and capture some star beasts on the star battlefield, without having to directly face powerful ones like the Tiger God?</p><p></p><p>After learning the technique, Ye Xiao continued to read some of the books he had brought back from the library. He reckoned that Bee Susanne should have finished her work, so he ordered Illusion Liuli to go to the mountain and meadow where he grew flowers, and pick some flowers to send over for Susanne to continue collecting honey.</p><p></p><p>As a qualified breeder, he had to make the most of every moment and try to create more benefits for himself from the breeding animals. Moreover, keeping them busy and overwhelmed would prevent them from having the time and energy to resist and try to escape.</p><p></p><p>Illusion Liuli received the order and quickly went to pick the flowers. She wanted to show the master that she was far more capable than the Great Dragon, who was just a cold, iron lump that could only be used to kill people.</p><p></p><p>She, on the other hand, could not only do the laundry and cook, but also warm the bed. If she could win Ye Xiao's favor, she estimated that she could become a Divine Ancestor in about three thousand years.</p><p></p><p>Just thinking about it made her feel happy and blessed.</p><p></p><p>As for Chen Qingxuan and the others trapped in Ye Xiao's formation, their situation was truly miserable.</p><p></p><p>Originally, they thought that even if they couldn't break the formation immediately, they would be able to do so within a month. But they never expected that this formation not only had illusion techniques, but also deadly killing power!</p><p></p><p>In other words, it was a deadly formation.</p><p></p><p>Starting from the fourth hour after they entered the formation, the killing formation began to activate. Various attacks came at them relentlessly, beating them into a sorry state, with the Divine Ancestors, Grand Masters, and Formation Masters all cowering and struggling to survive in the formation.</p><p></p><p>Until now, the killing power had subsided and turned into an illusion formation, allowing the group to finally catch their breath. But they were all lying on the ground, their bones aching, and finding it difficult to even stand up.</p><p></p><p>"I can't go on anymore. Professor Chen, can we really escape this formation?" Chen Qingxuan, lying on the ground, had tears welling up in his eyes, silently flowing down.</p><p></p><p>Because at this point, he didn't know anymore. He was completely lost in this formation.</p><p></p><p>The Chen Clan had been cultivating formations for nearly a thousand years, with even a three-year-old child having a basic understanding of a few formations. Yet now, he was trapped in a formation in Jianghai City, unable to escape.</p><p></p><p>How embarrassing! The ancestors of the Chen Clan would be ashamed.</p><p></p><p>Here is the full English translation of the Chinese excerpt:</p><p></p><p>The light was gone.</p><p></p><p>He estimated that when the illusion formation transformed into a deadly formation again, that would be the time when they were completely annihilated.</p><p></p><p>At that time, he would die completely in this formation, and no one would even find his body.</p><p></p><p>How desolate!</p><p></p><p>But at that moment, a melodious female voice suddenly rang in his ears, like a silver bell.</p><p></p><p>"The flower picker is skilled, adept at picking flowers. After picking the stones, he picks the precious stones, taking them all."</p><p></p><p>"A girl's voice? Could it be... an illusion? But this illusion, why does it feel so real?"</p><p></p><p>He struggled to get up from the ground, his eyes suddenly wide open, with an unbelievable expression on his face.</p><p></p><p>Not far from him, there was a young girl wearing a JK uniform and what seemed to be a family silk stocking, holding a basket and picking something.</p><p></p><p>After rubbing his eyes firmly and confirming that he was not dreaming, he immediately waved excitedly and shouted:</p><p></p><p>"Miss! Young miss! Over here!"</p><p></p><p>The others also noticed this scene and stood up, waving their hands.</p><p></p><p>"Over here! Please save us!"</p><p></p><p>Yuanliu stood up and glanced this way.</p><p></p><p>"Huh? Humans? Are they humans who have wandered in by mistake?"</p><p></p><p>However, she did not approach.</p><p></p><p>She was a star beast, and the other party was human. If she went over there rashly, she might be attacked.</p><p></p><p>It would be better to go back and tell the master.</p><p></p><p>After saying that, she shook her head and left.</p><p></p><p>Chen Qingxuan and the others rushed forward.</p><p></p><p>"Don't go! Don't go!"</p><p></p><p>However, before they could run far, they violently collided with an invisible air wall.</p><p></p><p>Duang~!</p><p></p><p>The huge impact force sent them flying back, and Chen Qingxuan and the others were on the verge of tears.</p><p></p><p>"This place, there is actually a defensive formation at the imperial level, separating the inside! Heavens, who is it? Who has set up such a monstrous formation here?"</p><p></p><p>When the time came to deep night, Ye Xiao's Plucking Star Hand had finally been completely cultivated, reaching the realm of great perfection.</p><p></p><p>He came outside, wanting to try the power of the Plucking Star Hand.</p><p></p><p>His body rose to a height of about 50,000 meters. Ye Xiao released the Taixuan Tiangong Scan, locking onto a target. It was a small bird sleeping in its nest.</p><p></p><p>According to their current oblique distance, it was about 100,000 meters, or exactly 100 kilometers away.</p><p></p><p>Then, Ye Xiao slowly extended his right hand, and with the Plucking Star Hand technique, in the blink of an eye, the small bird was in the palm of his hand.</p><p></p><p>The airflow sound in the high altitude woke up the small bird.</p><p></p><p>Small bird: "Σ(°△°|||)︴!"</p><p></p><p>Although it couldn't speak, Ye Xiao could already see its thoughts from its expression.</p><p></p><p>Who am I? Where am I? What am I doing? After a brief moment of shock, it immediately started to scream and flap its wings, trying to escape.</p><p></p><p>But under the control of the Plucking Star Hand, it could only flutter its wings in Ye Xiao's palm, unable to escape.</p><p></p><p>"Indeed, the Plucking Star Hand is amazing. I haven't even fully unleashed my full power, and within 100 kilometers, I can instantly capture it. If I push my power to the limit, I wonder how far I can reach."</p><p></p><p>Ye Xiao used the Plucking Star Hand again, and the small bird was instantly returned to its nest.</p><p></p><p>Back in the nest, the small bird looked around, completely dumbfounded. Its little brain couldn't comprehend what had just happened.</p><p></p><p>After testing the Plucking Star Hand, Ye Xiao prepared to return and rest.</p><p></p><p>But at this moment, a figure suddenly intruded into his perception.</p><p></p><p>"This is... a star beast?"</p><p></p><p>Ye Xiao looked in the direction of the distant figure, and the next moment, a figure with an extremely powerful aura appeared.</p><p></p><p>Wearing a black leather jacket, with a cold and ruthless gaze, exuding a strong aura of killing!</p><p></p><p>"A human cultivator? Perfect, it seems I don't need to go down and catch a tongue."</p><p></p><p>He spoke to Ye Xiao:</p><p></p><p>"Human, I have a question for you. Answer honestly, and I'll spare your life!"</p><p></p><p>Ye Xiao was silent for a moment, then immediately unleashed a Tathagata Divine Palm.</p><p></p><p>Boom! That star beast completely didn't expect Ye Xiao to be a powerful divine lord, and even more didn't expect him to attack so decisively without saying a word.</p><p></p><p>Boom! A dazzling light burst forth in the sky, accompanied by a violent explosion.</p><p></p><p>Many figures in Jianghai City were awakened.</p><p></p><p>"What's going on?"</p><p></p><p>"Is there an enemy attack?"</p><p></p><p>"Ah, it's happening again, the second time this month. I just finished recovering, and now it's going to be disrupted again."</p><p></p><p>Everyone, including Chang Feng and other experts, quickly gathered.</p><p></p><p>"Such a powerful attack and aura, this is Senior Sword Immortal!"</p><p></p><p>"Why would Senior Sword Immortal suddenly take action?"</p><p></p><p>"I don't know, the pressure from above is too terrifying, suppressing us from rising. But Senior Sword Immortal doesn't easily act rashly."</p><p></p><p>"Could it be that a powerful expert has come again?"</p><p></p><p>Three in the morning, nine thousand.</p><p></p><p>I'm working hard to update, very sorry for the late update.</p><p></p><p>(This chapter is complete)</p>

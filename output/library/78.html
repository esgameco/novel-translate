        <h1>Chapter 78</h1>
        <div class="content">
            <p>Here is the full English translation of the Chinese excerpt:</p><p></p><p>At this moment, Ye Xiao unexpectedly felt that the spiritual energy within his body had started to fluctuate and change slightly.</p><p></p><p>This was a sign that he was about to advance to the next level.</p><p></p><p>The difference between the Great Master and the Master realm is that the Great Master not only cultivates the martial dao, but also integrates the essence of the martial dao into the martial dao itself.</p><p></p><p>The two must be fused together in order to achieve advancement, and one cannot be lacking.</p><p></p><p>For example, if the martial dao realm is sufficient but the spiritual energy storage has not reached the limit, advancement would not be possible.</p><p></p><p>Similarly, even if the spiritual energy has reached the critical point, if the martial dao realm is not enough, advancement would still be difficult.</p><p></p><p>Ye Xiao had the divine book soul imprint, and was cultivating several top-tier cultivation methods, so the speed at which he absorbed spiritual energy was actually very fast. </p><p></p><p>At least, it was much faster than the average Great Master.</p><p></p><p>Because in this world, as long as the cultivation methods and mental techniques are constantly in motion, one's cultivation can be continuously improved.</p><p></p><p>The difference between cultivation methods and mental techniques is that one is used for combat, while the other is used to replenish spiritual energy.</p><p></p><p>So when his realm was sufficient, he could easily break through.</p><p></p><p>The last time Ye Xiao broke through, he had gained the insight of the importance of protection - protecting oneself and one's companions.</p><p></p><p>But this time, Ye Xiao's insight was from the heart.</p><p></p><p>Just like with that Mr. Zhao before.</p><p></p><p>Why should he have to come out just because Mr. Zhao wanted to find him? </p><p></p><p>Mr. Zhao was deceiving him and had no righteousness, so should he still indulge him? Then what use was his powerful strength? He might as well not cultivate at all and just chain himself up for Mr. Zhao to guard.</p><p></p><p>The strong possess the power to control their own destiny! Because the United States is powerful, it can act recklessly around the world.</p><p></p><p>Similarly, since he was stronger than those fighter pilots, he could kill them if they dared to make a move on him! </p><p></p><p>Not only could he kill them, but he could also steal their design blueprints.</p><p></p><p>He was not a demon, and would not indiscriminately slaughter the innocent.</p><p></p><p>But whether to kill or not, the power of control was in his hands.</p><p></p><p>When one's strength becomes powerful, one's character will also gradually become stronger, and in turn nourish one's martial dao realm.</p><p></p><p>The fluctuation of spiritual energy within Ye Xiao's body became increasingly intense, like boiling water, becoming more and more turbulent.</p><p></p><p>Boom! Finally, accompanied by a dull sound, the spiritual energy in Ye Xiao's body broke through the clouds and entered a brand new realm.</p><p></p><p>Innate Fifth Grade!</p><p></p><p>At this moment, the amount of spiritual energy stored in his body had become even thicker!</p><p></p><p>At this moment, his martial dao realm had also become even more profound!</p><p></p><p>At this moment, he had drawn even closer to the realm of 'invincibility'!</p><p></p><p>The scorching hot weather in the entire Jianghai City suddenly had a touch of coolness, refreshing the heart and soul.</p><p></p><p>Countless citizens of Jianghai City felt this refreshing coolness, and their restless hearts seemed to have been soothed, becoming calm.</p><p></p><p>The maple leaves by the roadside had turned red, and the autumn chrysanthemums bloomed silently in the cool wind, after the other flowers had withered.</p><p></p><p>It was a cool autumn.</p><p></p><p>By the time Ye Xiao finished his lunch and returned to the library, it was already 2 o'clock in the afternoon.</p><p></p><p>Ning Yuhen and several administrators were discussing something. As Ye Xiao passed by, he couldn't help but be slightly surprised.</p><p></p><p>They were looking at a newspaper and discussing a certain fighter aircraft.</p><p></p><p>And this fighter aircraft was the one whose blueprint Ye Xiao had just sent out.</p><p></p><p>"The manager has arrived."</p><p></p><p>Ning Yuhen and the others noticed Ye Xiao's arrival and greeted him immediately.</p><p></p><p>Ye Xiao nodded, clasped his hands behind his back, and watched them discuss.</p><p></p><p>These people, when would they start to care about the technology of war?</p><p></p><p>Here is the full English translation of the Chinese excerpt:</p><p></p><p>So interested in this, are you?</p><p></p><p>A young man was the most enthusiastic in the discussion.</p><p></p><p>"This is the most powerful fighter jet just announced by the United States! The Starhawk! It is the most advanced in the world! It can unleash combat power and speed at the Grandmaster level!</p><p></p><p>The cost of just one of these is over 60 billion US dollars.</p><p></p><p>It's said that only Grandmaster-level experts have the qualifications to control it."</p><p></p><p>Ye Xiao slightly raised his eyebrows behind them.</p><p></p><p>Is this fighter jet really that powerful? But, to be honest, when those three fighter jets launched six attacks, I was indeed threatened and lightly injured without any defenses.</p><p></p><p>And those six attacks did possess Grandmaster-level combat power.</p><p></p><p>If it were an ordinary, no, even three ordinary Grandmasters facing those three fighter jets, they might accidentally perish.</p><p></p><p>It's just a pity that they encountered me, who can fight beyond my level, so the result was...</p><p></p><p>Nevermind, I don't want to think about it.</p><p></p><p>It can be a good thing, and it's not bad either, after all, I've already handed over the design drawings and the USB drive to Changfeng, which is also a good thing for the Nine Realms.</p><p></p><p>Ning Yuhan couldn't help but sigh, "I wish we in the Nine Realms could also create such a fighter jet."</p><p></p><p>"I wish so too, but for now, it's too difficult. We in the Nine Realms are far behind in the development of military technology and genetic technology compared to them. And they have technological blockades, not teaching us the technology. The Nine Realms, relying solely on our own exploration, won't be able to create a fighter jet comparable to the Starhawk anytime soon.</p><p></p><p>But one day in the future, we will definitely create one that surpasses the US fighter jets!"</p><p></p><p>"I really hope someone can create it right now!"</p><p></p><p>"If someone could create the Starhawk fighter jet right now, he would definitely go down in history and leave a deep mark in the scientific field of the Nine Realms! If nothing else, being able to steal the Starhawk's design drawings and hand them over would also bring him the highest honor and rewards in the Nine Realms!"</p><p></p><p>"Will it be worth several billion?"</p><p></p><p>"Several billion? At least starting from hundreds of billions to over a trillion!"</p><p></p><p>Ye Xiao: "..."</p><p></p><p>Is this fighter jet really worth so much money?</p><p></p><p>His expression became a bit dazed.</p><p></p><p>After a long while, he finally came to his senses and let out a long sigh.</p><p></p><p>Nevermind.</p><p></p><p>Wealth is external to oneself. </p><p></p><p>I am dedicating myself for the country and the great cause of the nation, how can I think about money? Vulgar! Thinking this way, Ye Xiao went back to reading his books.</p><p></p><p>He had already learned six Tempering Body Arts, and estimated that with one or two, at most three more, he would be able to collect the complete set of Tempering Body Art foundation techniques.</p><p></p><p>At that time, he would be able to integrate them into a top-tier Tempering Body Art.</p><p></p><p>That way, not only would his defensive power increase significantly, but he would also have an additional life-saving technique. And when he unleashed the Divine Will Incantation, his skin would no longer be torn apart by the powerful winds.</p><p></p><p>However, as always, when the last one or two techniques were about to be found, it would become very difficult.</p><p></p><p>The vast majority of techniques are derived from the same source.</p><p></p><p>Cultivation techniques are constantly evolving from a basic technique. </p><p></p><p>Thousands upon thousands of versions have been modified, deleted, added, and revised, possibly becoming a new technique.</p><p></p><p>But despite the myriad changes, they never stray from their origins.</p><p></p><p>Ye Xiao was not discouraged.</p><p></p><p>He would find them eventually, it's just a matter of time.</p><p></p><p>This is the second update, please support the new book.

        <h1>Chapter 37</h1>
        <div class="content">
            <p>Here is the full English translation of the Chinese excerpt:</p><p></p><p>Ye Xiao kept reading until late afternoon when it was almost time to get off work, and then he finally closed the book.</p><p></p><p>This book was probably about the story of a year when the star beasts invaded, and humanity rose up to resist the beast disaster.</p><p></p><p>Ye Xiao had seen this kind of story in other books before - when the frontlines could not withstand the onslaught of the star beasts, they would intentionally create some gaps in the frontlines and let in a portion of the star beasts.</p><p></p><p>Firstly, this could buffer the impact.</p><p>Secondly, it could also train the abilities of the people in the rear.</p><p></p><p>But the book he was reading recorded an instance of a beast disaster over a hundred years ago, which was the one before the last time humanity faced a beast disaster.</p><p></p><p>According to the records, although this beast disaster was not the most powerful in human history, its level of danger was such that it almost wiped out the entire Nine Provinces! It could be considered the greatest invasion disaster in the history of the Nine Provinces! Many major states in the world joined forces to drive the beast disaster towards the Nine Provinces, directly causing the Nine Provinces to bear the brunt of that disaster!</p><p></p><p>There were many star beasts that entered the Nine Provinces, and not a few of them were powerful ones.</p><p></p><p>And the one that came near the cities of Jiang Hai and the surrounding area was a star beast called the Aier King.</p><p></p><p>A dragon-level bloodline super star beast! </p><p></p><p>It was rumored to have the ability to revive from death - as long as it had one hand or a piece of flesh left, it would eventually revive! Each time it revived, its power would recover to its peak state! That battle was extremely brutal, the Zhongzhou region to which Jiang Hai City belonged sacrificed one Divine Ancestor and as many as eight Grand Ancestors to finally seal its physical body in separate places.</p><p></p><p>"This plot..." Ye Xiao pondered.</p><p></p><p>Why did it feel so familiar?</p><p></p><p>It was just like the routine in novels.</p><p></p><p>Could that map of the Aier King be used to mark the locations of the Aier King's body parts? </p><p></p><p>Obtaining the map, collecting the seven fragments of the Aier King's corpse, and summoning the revival of the Aier King? But previously, the guard team's Huxi and this spiritual Huxi, were they related? If they were related, then it meant that the Huxi in Jiang Hai City might not be just one.</p><p></p><p>It seems there will be a lot of trouble in the future! Ye Xiao sighed lightly, preparing to put the legend of the stars back on the bookshelf, when a familiar voice suddenly sounded in his ear.</p><p></p><p>"You also like to read this book, huh."</p><p></p><p>Ye Xiao paused and looked back.</p><p></p><p>"Manager Yang."</p><p></p><p>The person was Yang Zhengyi, the manager of the personnel department, who was more or less Ye Xiao's superior.</p><p></p><p>"I didn't disturb you, did I?" Yang Zhengyi smiled.</p><p></p><p>Ye Xiao shook his head.</p><p></p><p>"Of course not."</p><p></p><p>"How come you thought to read this book?"</p><p></p><p>"I was just bored, and when I saw this book, I found it quite interesting, so I read a bit more. Manager Yang, have you read this book before?"</p><p></p><p>"I've read a bit. It was written by the older generation, and it sold quite well in our time. What are your thoughts on it?"</p><p></p><p>"I wouldn't say I have any particular thoughts, I just find the Divine Ancestors and Grand Masters who stood up for humanity to be quite tragic and admirable!"</p><p></p><p>"It's rare for you to think that way. Not many people remember history these days."</p><p></p><p>"Duang~."</p><p></p><p>The evening work bell rang, and Ye Xiao put the book back on the shelf.</p><p></p><p>"It's time to get off work, Manager, if there's nothing else, I'll be leaving first."</p><p></p><p>Yang Zhengyi nodded and smiled kindly.</p><p></p><p>"Go on, be careful on your way home."</p><p></p><p>After Ye Xiao left, Yang Zhengyi stared at Ye Xiao's back, and the smile on his face gradually turned into a puzzled expression. He was silent for a long time before putting the book back on the shelf.</p><p></p><p>"Maybe I'm overthinking it."</p><p></p><p>Ye Xiao went back to the third floor to pick up Huan Liuli, as they were quite far apart, he couldn't really use spiritual power to communicate.</p><p></p><p>Here is the full English translation of the Chinese excerpt:</p><p></p><p>The summoning power, if seen by someone with ulterior motives, would inevitably lead to unnecessary speculation. However, as he was going upstairs, he couldn't help but feel a bit puzzled.</p><p></p><p>"This Manager Yang seems a bit strange. But he doesn't have the aura of a beast spirit, so he shouldn't be a Hucheng (a type of demonic beast). </p><p></p><p>However, his cultivation level is definitely not low!"</p><p></p><p>Ye Xiao could vaguely sense that the other party was extraordinary. But for experts above the Sect Master level, they could all conceal their aura, making it very difficult to detect their true strength!</p><p></p><p>If he used the Taixuan Tiangong (a powerful technique), he should be able to find out.</p><p></p><p>It's just that the two of them were just in close proximity, using the Taixuan Tiangong would most likely expose himself as well.</p><p></p><p>It's not worth it.</p><p></p><p>Furthermore, in the novels of the past, there were always these kind of "sweeping the floor monks", so maybe Manager Yang is one of them.</p><p></p><p>Forget it, for these small fry matters, it's better not to get too involved. This could be a hidden big shot, so it's best not to meddle too much, lest I invite trouble I don't need.</p><p></p><p>Arriving upstairs, Ning Yuhen was mopping the floor, the young lady/young man was quite diligent, having cleaned Ye Xiao's area spotlessly.</p><p></p><p>Since she/he was a post-Heavenly Fifth-Grade cultivator, she/he didn't sweat much, but her/his delicate rosy cheeks were slightly flushed.</p><p></p><p>What a charming creature! "Manager Ye, you're here."</p><p></p><p>Ye Xiao nodded.</p><p></p><p>"There's no need to mop the floor every day, the third floor doesn't get much traffic, mopping every two to three days is enough."</p><p></p><p>Ning Yuhen smiled sweetly: "I don't have anything else to do, so I can take it as exercise."</p><p></p><p>"If you like it, then that's fine. After work, let's go have dinner together."</p><p></p><p>"Okay!"</p><p></p><p>The two of them, plus a cat, went downstairs to the cafeteria for dinner. When it was time to pay, Ye Xiao swiped his own card, settling the bill for both of them.</p><p></p><p>Ning Yuhen quickly spoke up:</p><p></p><p>"Manager Ye, let me pay. It's my first day here, I can't let you treat me."</p><p></p><p>"It's fine, consider it a thank you for helping me mop the floor."</p><p></p><p>Ye Xiao said, carrying his own tray and finding a seat. Ning Yuhen hurriedly followed.</p><p></p><p>"Thank you, Manager Ye."</p><p></p><p>Normally, Ye Xiao is Ning Yuhen's superior, and Ning Yuhen helping him mop the floor is nothing special, but Ye Xiao took the initiative to pay and treat him to dinner, without putting on airs or bullying him, which is truly rare.</p><p></p><p>Ye Xiao picked up a piece of duck liver for Illusion Liuli, while enjoying the delicious food, he casually said:</p><p></p><p>"There's no need to thank me, I just don't like that kind of bullying with power, and I don't like owing favors either."</p><p></p><p>"Nowadays, there are very few people like Manager Ye."</p><p></p><p>"It's not that bad, most people are good. You just haven't seen them."</p><p></p><p>Ning Yuhen nodded, seeing Ye Xiao's expression remained indifferent without much joy, so he didn't continue the conversation and focused on savoring his own dinner.</p><p></p><p>Ye Xiao glanced at him unintentionally, this young lady/young man, eating slowly and meticulously, had a refined lady-like demeanor, which he found quite puzzling.</p><p></p><p>Men can have the heroic manner of eating meat heartily, and they can also have the elegant dining etiquette of a gentleman.</p><p></p><p>But someone like Ning Yuhen, he found it quite difficult to understand.</p><p></p><p>Before the meal was finished, Ye Xiao's phone in his pocket started ringing, the caller ID showed it was Gu Hai.</p><p></p><p>"Hello! What's the matter?"</p><p></p><p>"Old Ye, do me a favor, send me a few books related to Hucheng (demonic beasts)."</p><p></p><p>"I'm off work, I won't go."</p><p></p><p>This is the first update, please support the new book.</p><p></p><p>(Chapter end)</p>

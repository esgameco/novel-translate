        <h1>Chapter 11</h1>
        <div class="content">
            <p>Here is the full English translation of the Chinese excerpt:</p><p></p><p>Due to a shortage of staff in certain positions, the library needs to transfer a group of employees, and the list is displayed on the big screen.</p><p></p><p>But don't worry, the positions I've chosen for you are all very good, and will only be better than the library, not worse.</p><p></p><p>As for the management areas of the missing personnel, others will step up to fill in.</p><p></p><p>Additionally, we will install a batch of surveillance cameras outside our library, and I will assign some administrators to be responsible for it.</p><p></p><p>Ye Xiao glanced at the list on the big screen, which was mainly from the second and third floors, perhaps because those floors were relatively idle.</p><p></p><p>But his own name was not on the list, which was quite fortunate.</p><p></p><p>Although going to other positions means he can still come to the library to borrow books, it's still not as convenient as being a librarian, being able to read a few books whenever he wants, even during work hours.</p><p></p><p>After the morning meeting, the manager Yang Zhengyi started arranging the personnel transfers.</p><p></p><p>He divided the people into several groups, those who need to go to other positions went to other positions, and those who should return to their own positions went back.</p><p></p><p>The administrators who didn't leave the second and third floors would temporarily manage the areas of the transferred colleagues, until new people are added to supplement them.</p><p></p><p>Ye Xiao was also assigned an additional area.</p><p></p><p>This is a good thing for Ye Xiao.</p><p></p><p>Because he can openly read books in the other areas during work hours.</p><p></p><p>Just as he was about to go back, Manager Yang called out to him:</p><p></p><p>"Ye Xiao, wait a moment."</p><p></p><p>Ye Xiao stopped and looked back at Manager Yang.</p><p></p><p>"What's the matter?"</p><p></p><p>"Don't go to work yet. Gu Hai didn't show up this morning, and his phone is turned off, so I can't reach him. I'm worried he might have encountered some trouble yesterday. You two are the closest, so can you go find him?"</p><p></p><p>Ye Xiao raised his eyebrows slightly.</p><p></p><p>"Okay, I understand."</p><p></p><p>He walked out of the library, and the damaged land and buildings had almost all been repaired, making the city look brand new.</p><p></p><p>Probably because cultivators and spirit beasts are more likely to destroy the city, the construction material technology in this world is quite advanced, with all kinds of fast-drying materials that are useful and inexpensive.</p><p></p><p>Some colleagues had already started installing surveillance cameras, maybe the director wants to investigate who the super expert is.</p><p></p><p>Unfortunately, when a master cultivator unleashes their power, it will disrupt the surrounding magnetic field, affecting any electronic equipment. Even the best surveillance cameras would be useless.</p><p></p><p>"Yesterday, Gu Hai went to get his student ID, but ran off halfway. Most likely he went to find a woman.</p><p>This guy, even if he doesn't get killed by a spirit beast, he'll end up dying from a woman's belly."</p><p></p><p>As soon as Ye Xiao walked out of the library, his phone rang.</p><p>Seeing the familiar number, his face darkened.</p><p></p><p>"Hello, Elder Luo."</p><p>"Little Ye, your son has been caught by me again, and this time it's even worse. Come over here quickly."</p><p>"Understood."</p><p></p><p>Ye Xiao sighed lightly and went to the city defense force again.</p><p></p><p>"Captain, I'm almost 66 years old, and he's still taking advantage of me. How am I supposed to live? In the future, I won't even have the face to see my wife. You have to speak up for me."</p><p></p><p>The defense force headquarters was as noisy as ever, with all kinds of bizarre incidents happening frequently.</p><p></p><p>At Elder Luo's post, Ye Xiao found Gu Hai. This time, he was still in a somewhat decent state, with just a lipstick mark on his collar and a slap mark on his face, and his clothes were still fine.</p><p></p><p>Ye Xiao glared at him with an impatient look, and Gu Hai lowered his head, smiling awkwardly.</p><p></p><p>Here is the full English translation of the Chinese excerpt:</p><p></p><p>The old routine, Ye Xiao handed another stack of red paper to Old Lu.</p><p></p><p>"Brother Lu, thank you for your trouble."</p><p></p><p>Old Lu furrowed his brow.</p><p></p><p>"Little Ye, this can't keep happening, once or twice I can do you a personal favor. But if it happens too often, it won't be easy for me."</p><p></p><p>Ye Xiao nodded.</p><p></p><p>"Alright, go with them, but don't do it again next time."</p><p></p><p>The two thanked him and left the garrison, heading towards the library.</p><p></p><p>Gu Hai hurriedly apologized.</p><p></p><p>"Old Ye, I really didn't expect that even with the beast rampage yesterday, the garrison would still have time to catch people like this."</p><p></p><p>Ye Xiao said impatiently:</p><p></p><p>"When you usually get caught, I don't see you going there less. You go, and you still get caught every time! I'm telling you, this is the last time. Next time if you get caught again, don't come to me, I can't afford to lose face for you."</p><p></p><p>"Hehe, don't worry, I've got experience now, I definitely won't get caught next time.</p><p></p><p>But actually, it wasn't my fault yesterday. I was waiting for someone near the university, got tired of standing, so I wanted to lean on a Volkswagen nearby, and just happened to put the green tea I just bought on the hood. Then a pretty girl came and asked if I wanted to play together. </p><p></p><p>How could I pass up such a good opportunity?"</p><p></p><p>Ye Xiao couldn't be bothered to respond to him, and after returning to the library, he calmed himself down and immediately went to the third floor area B to start reading.</p><p></p><p>After the beast rampage incident, he gained a deeper understanding of the dangers in this world, and knew he couldn't be too laidback, he had to get stronger as much as possible.</p><p></p><p>He immediately began to study cultivation techniques.</p><p></p><p>Cultivation techniques and martial arts are the same, both rely on circulating the techniques or arts within the meridians to attract spiritual energy, constantly refining the body and spirit, in order to enhance one's cultivation.</p><p></p><p>But martial arts mainly focus on attack release and amplification, while cultivation techniques are about quickly replenishing one's depleted spiritual energy during battle.</p><p></p><p>Choosing a cultivation technique can allow him to quickly repair the consumption of his powerful moves.</p><p></p><p>After becoming a master, his reading speed had also increased significantly.</p><p></p><p>Originally, he could only read about 20 cultivation techniques in two hours, but now he could read nearly 200.</p><p></p><p>Among the 200 cultivation techniques, Ye Xiao selected two core techniques, adding to the three he had before, making a total of five core cultivation techniques.</p><p></p><p>But his divine book did not light up, indicating that the time for fusion had not yet come.</p><p></p><p>However, Ye Xiao was not in a hurry. With the addition of three basic core cultivation techniques, his speed of absorbing and replenishing spiritual energy had already increased slightly.</p><p></p><p>Moreover, he had just read less than 200 today and found three core techniques, at this rate, it probably wouldn't take him more than two days to gather the necessary core techniques for fusion and upgrade.</p><p></p><p>How wonderful.</p><p></p><p>Dong~!</p><p></p><p>The bell for getting off work rang, it's time for dinner.</p><p></p><p>Ye Xiao had just closed the book, and as soon as he looked up, he saw Gu Hai in the distance staring at him with a gloomy expression.</p><p></p><p>Seeing that Ye Xiao had noticed him, Gu Hai walked over and said in a gloomy tone:</p><p></p><p>"Old Ye, I didn't expect you, you've been hiding it so deep!"</p><p></p><p>This made Ye Xiao's heart skip a beat, did his fast reading expose him?</p>

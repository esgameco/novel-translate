        <h1>Chapter 238</h1>
        <div class="content">
            <p>Here is the full English translation of the excerpt from the Chinese novel:</p><p></p><p>In the heart of Shaolin, many high-ranking Buddhist monks came together, chanting Buddhist scriptures and channeling their spiritual energy to empower the sacred texts. Streams of golden runes flowed from their mouths, like an endless river, pouring into the deep well.</p><p></p><p>The pure, righteous power of the Buddhist sect gathered relentlessly at the mouth of the well, suppressing the surging demonic aura. The two forces were locked in a stalemate, for the Buddhist power was simply too overwhelming.</p><p></p><p>Even with the combined might of so many Shaolin experts, they were unable to completely subdue the evil. This was because subduing was different from outright annihilation. If they were to unleash their full Buddhist power to destroy it, they certainly had the capability. After all, this was the collective strength of Shaolin's top echelon.</p><p></p><p>However, they could not afford to eliminate Li Liushui. As a Ninth-Rank Innate expert, he was of utmost importance to the entire Nine Provinces. Such a powerful figure could not be casually killed.</p><p></p><p>They had to find a way to save him. The Buddhists had to use their powers to both suppress the demonic aura and redeem Li Liushui's soul, guiding him back to the righteous path. This division of their efforts meant that the power expended on each task was no less than what would have been required for outright destruction.</p><p></p><p>As a result, the Shaolin monks needed a force several times greater than their normal capabilities to maintain this stalemate. But they could not simply amplify their power that much, and so the situation had devolved into a drawn-out battle of attrition.</p><p></p><p>Fortunately, after their tireless efforts over the past few days and nights, without rest or sustenance, they had managed to suppress the demonic aura. The upward trend had been contained, and there was now hope.</p><p></p><p>The gathered monks finally had a chance to catch their breath. "Amitabha! It seems the Dao God Li Liushui has been blessed by the Buddhas, turning calamity into fortune."</p><p></p><p>"Truly, the Buddhas have protected us. Had he broken free, not just Shaolin, but the entire Nine Provinces would have been drenched in blood."</p><p></p><p>"Good, let's all rest a bit, then make one final push to subdue his demonic energy."</p><p></p><p>"Yes, Master!"</p><p></p><p>But just as the monks were about to catch their breath, an unexpected turn of events occurred. A crimson demonic aura suddenly surged from the back of the crowd, rushing towards the well.</p><p></p><p>The monks' faces immediately turned grave. "Oh no, quickly, stop her! We cannot let her touch that well!"</p><p></p><p>Alas, it was too late. Before the monks could act, the crimson aura reached the well's mouth. The woman then struck her own chest, spitting a mouthful of blood directly into the well.</p><p></p><p>"No!" the monks cried out, and powerful attacks were immediately launched at her.</p><p></p><p>In the next moment, she was blasted away, crashing heavily to the ground. "You vile creature, Xu Saniang!"</p><p></p><p>Ignoring her injuries, Xu Saniang let out a chilling laugh. "Three hundred years ago, Shaolin imprisoned my husband and I in the Seventy-Two Demonic Caverns to collect the star beasts. My husband perished in grief, and I have never forgotten this debt. Now, with the sealing talisman broken by the lightning, I have waited here for this moment."</p><p></p><p>"Wretched thing! Even at the brink of death, you refuse to repent. We killed your husband because he had committed grave sins by devouring countless lives. And now you have sabotaged our efforts here. We cannot let you live."</p><p></p><p>The monks unleashed their attacks again, but Xu Saniang merely smiled coldly. "What do I have to fear? When my husband died three hundred years ago, I had already died with him. Only this soulless husk remains. Today, I have used my blood to unleash Li Liushui's demonic nature, and he will avenge my husband and I."</p><p></p><p>As the words left her lips, the Buddhist attacks struck her, and she was swiftly dispatched. But just as she had foretold, the moment she perished, a terrifying demonic aura erupted from the well, surging towards the heavens and setting the very clouds ablaze with its crimson glow.</p><p></p><p>"Retreat! All disciples below the Sect Master level, withdraw immediately!" the Abbot commanded, and the Shaolin monks hastily fell back.</p><p></p><p>Seconds later, a thunderous explosion shook the earth, and a towering, unimaginable power burst forth from the well. Sensing this overwhelming might, the Shaolin monks were gripped by sheer terror.</p><p></p><p>It was too strong! The accumulated murderous intent of Dao God Li Liushui's entire lifetime had now been unleashed, like a raging flood that could no longer be contained.</p><p></p><p>"Abbot! What do we do?"</p><p></p><p>Here is the full English translation of the Chinese excerpt:</p><p></p><p>The few divine patriarchs of Shaolin were all extremely tense at the moment.</p><p></p><p>Although they were powerful divine patriarchs, facing Li Liushui at this time, they were all extremely nervous, as if they were not formidable divine patriarch experts, but insignificant ants.</p><p></p><p>The Abbot of Shaolin, with a grave expression, said:</p><p></p><p>"At this point, we can only use force to suppress him. If we cannot suppress his demonic qi, then we can only send him to the Western Pure Land."</p><p></p><p>"Yes!"</p><p></p><p>"His strength is too great, we should not fight him one-on-one. Set up the Vajra Formation to Subdue Demons and Monsters, and use the formation to suppress him."</p><p></p><p>At the Abbot's order, everyone immediately began to unleash the formation.</p><p></p><p>The Vajra Formation to Subdue Demons and Monsters could be considered one of Shaolin's supreme formation techniques, the most powerful and superior among Shaolin's formations.</p><p></p><p>Its power had reached the level of an imperial formation.</p><p></p><p>Over the years, no one had been able to escape from this formation!</p><p></p><p>Let alone the fact that the formation being deployed now was being unleashed by the few divine patriarch experts of Shaolin, the power of which was unimaginable.</p><p></p><p>Even a peak Xiantian Ninth Rank cultivator would be unable to escape.</p><p></p><p>The golden light began to shine again, then surrounded Li Liushui.</p><p></p><p>Li Liushui, wearing a plain robe, had his sleeves and long hair fluttering in the wind, with a blood-colored aura and demonic qi surging around him.</p><p></p><p>It was evident that he himself was trying to control this energy, but his strength was truly limited, and he was unable to suppress it.</p><p></p><p>Seeing Shaolin's formation, he was aroused to battle and directly mobilized the energy within his body, slashing out with a sword.</p><p></p><p>Boom! The spiritual energy mixed with bloody killing intent condensed into a blood-colored sword beam over a hundred meters long, which slashed violently onto the Vajra Formation to Subdue Demons and Monsters.</p><p></p><p>With a single attack, the entire formation began to sway violently.</p><p></p><p>The hearts of the crowd trembled.</p><p></p><p>They had not expected that his attack power would be so strong, and when they actually received his attack, they realized that his attacks were far stronger than they had appeared.</p><p></p><p>One slash was not enough, Li Liushui slashed again.</p><p></p><p>Then the third slash, the fourth slash, the fifth slash, each time his power was stronger than the previous one, and with each slash, the formation would tremble violently.</p><p></p><p>Two Xiantian Seventh Rank divine patriarch masters, whose strength was relatively low, even began to vomit blood and tremble uncontrollably, unable to withstand it.</p><p></p><p>The formation also gradually developed cracks under Li Liushui's relentless attacks.</p><p></p><p>Crack, crack, finally, when the tenth slash was unleashed, the formation could no longer withstand it and shattered on the spot.</p><p></p><p>Boom! A huge mushroom cloud rose, and the powerful shockwave directly blew all the people back several steps!</p><p></p><p>"Pu-chi!" Some of the divine patriarchs even began to vomit blood, severely injured by the shockwave.</p><p></p><p>"Abbot, we can't hold on, he's too strong, we're no match for him."</p><p></p><p>The Abbot was even more anxious, but at this critical moment, a huge golden sword beam suddenly fell from the sky.</p><p></p><p>Boom! This sword beam fell and slashed heavily onto Li Liushui, directly slamming him into the ground.</p><p></p><p>"Brother Liushui, quickly come to your senses."</p><p></p><p>"It's Sword Saint Lu Qingshan!"</p><p></p><p>The crowd rejoiced, with the Sword Saint here to share the burden, they would be much more at ease.</p><p></p><p>Lu Qingshan's sword strike, taking advantage of Li Liushui's inattention, hit Li Liushui's body hard, causing his spiritual energy to violently shake, and his body to sustain significant injuries. His soul was also relieved of much of the suppression, and his consciousness gradually awakened.</p><p></p><p>The Abbot of Shaolin took the opportunity to imprint his string of Buddhist beads on Li Liushui's chest, directly suppressing the remaining demonic qi within him.</p><p></p><p>After a moment, a faint murmur came from Li Liushui's mouth.</p><p></p><p>"Sorry... for the trouble."</p><p></p><p>The crowd heard these words and could only sigh with relief.</p><p></p><p>"Your consciousness has finally returned, congratulations."</p><p></p><p>Li Liushui's awareness gradually cleared, and he slowly stood up, wearing the Buddhist beads on his hand.</p><p></p><p>"The attack just now, combined with the Abbot's Buddhist beads that have been cultivated for many years, allowed me to regain consciousness, but this is only temporary, and I will eventually have another outbreak."</p><p></p><p>The expressions of the crowd all became extremely grave.</p><p></p><p>Just now, Li Liushui was still holding back, not unleashing his full attack power.</p><p></p><p>But even so, his strength was beyond the reach of ordinary people.</p><p></p><p>If he were to fully succumb to the demonic path, who could withstand him? Who could save him?</p><p></p><p>Lu Qingshan pondered for a moment, then spoke:</p><p></p><p>"Brother Liushui, go to Jianghai City! Perhaps there, you can find a way to be saved."</p>

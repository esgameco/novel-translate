        <div class="content">
            <p>Here is the full English translation of the Chinese excerpt:</p><p></p><p>Under Brother Li's operation, the formation was quickly opened into a cave.</p><p></p><p>An extremely thick spiritual energy rushed out from within, transmitting crazily.</p><p></p><p>The two brothers' faces lit up with joy.</p><p></p><p>"Such powerful spiritual energy, can you feel it? This spiritual energy is so powerful, there must be good things inside. Quick, let's rush in!"</p><p></p><p>The two immediately transformed into two beams of light and rushed into the formation, and then the formation closed in an instant.</p><p></p><p>"Brother, it's so dark in here! I'm a bit scared."</p><p></p><p>"You idiot! You're a man. Don't be afraid like a sissy. This little place and you're still scared?"</p><p></p><p>"Let's light it up first, the spiritual energy here is thick, but it's pitch black and we can't see anything."</p><p></p><p>"Mm!"</p><p></p><p>The two used secret techniques to ignite the spiritual energy, creating a flash of fire.</p><p></p><p>The next second, the light shone brightly, and the two looked at the group of figures around them, falling into silence.</p><p></p><p>Brother Li: "(⊙.⊙)!"</p><p></p><p>Brother Li's Younger Brother: "(⊙.⊙)!"</p><p></p><p>"It should be an illusion, let's try again."</p><p></p><p>Brother Li extinguished the fire and then ignited it again.</p><p></p><p>"Roar—!"</p><p>"No—!"</p><p>"Help!"</p><p></p><p>Ye Xiao, who had just gotten off work from the library, seemed to sense something and couldn't help but raise his eyebrows slightly.</p><p></p><p>"What's going on? I just heard a scream."</p><p></p><p>He sent out a sense, sensing that his basement was intact, and the few spirit beasts were chatting as usual, without anything special happening.</p><p></p><p>There wasn't even a single strand of hair out of place in the basement.</p><p></p><p>He shook his head.</p><p></p><p>"Maybe I'm just too tired lately and started having hallucinations."</p><p></p><p>Afterwards, he started walking towards his home.</p><p></p><p>At this moment, on the Lingwu ship of the Cloud Family, Cloud Shui, who had been resting with his eyes closed, suddenly opened his eyes, and two sharp cold lights flashed in his eyes.</p><p></p><p>"This aura, it's them! It's my spirit pets! They haven't died, they're still alive."</p><p></p><p>Cloud Shui's breathing couldn't help but become a little rapid.</p><p></p><p>These days, the thing that had made him the most distressed and painful was his spirit pets.</p><p></p><p>He had thought they had been captured by others to be used as side dishes.</p><p></p><p>But unexpectedly, they were still alive!</p><p></p><p>If that's the case, he must find a way to bring them back.</p><p></p><p>"Zhen Wu!"</p><p></p><p>Zhen Wu immediately walked out of his room.</p><p></p><p>He cupped his hands and said to Cloud Shui, "I wonder what instructions Cloud Elder has?"</p><p></p><p>Cloud Shui's face was grave. "My spirit pets haven't died. I've sensed their aura!"</p><p></p><p>Zhen Wu couldn't help but be stunned.</p><p></p><p>"Really?"</p><p></p><p>"Of course it's true. They are all raised by me personally, I know their aura the best.</p><p></p><p>They are in the direction of the Ning Family."</p><p></p><p>"It seems that it must be the Ning Family's people who are up to no good behind the scenes."</p><p></p><p>Cloud Shui shook his head.</p><p></p><p>"It shouldn't be. The Ning Family doesn't have that much courage yet. Moreover, the highest strength in the Ning Family here is only Ning Zhiyuan's fourth uncle, at the Slaughter God Realm Second Layer."</p><p></p><p>"In that case, let's go find them quickly, lest the night gets longer and the dream gets longer."</p><p></p><p>Cloud Shui nodded, ready to take action, but the next moment, he suddenly felt a message flooding into his mind.</p><p></p><p>"This, this is my heaven!"</p><p></p><p>Cloud Shui's eyes widened, his face full of disbelief.</p><p></p><p>Zhen Wu couldn't help but ask puzzledly, "Cloud Elder, what's wrong?"</p><p></p><p>Cloud Shui's face became grave.</p><p></p><p>"Young Master, he wants to challenge that genius of the human world, that Sword Immortal!"</p><p></p><p>Hearing these words, Zhen Wu's pupils also instantly contracted.</p><p></p><p>The Young Master of the Cloud Family actually wants to challenge that genius of the human world.</p><p></p><p>Has that genius already reached the level to be noticed by the Young Master?</p><p></p><p>After all, the Young Master of the Cloud Family is the most outstanding genius of the Cloud Family in decades!</p><p></p><p>His talent has already surpassed all the previous Young Masters of the Cloud Family!</p><p></p><p>Now, he has already reached the Slaughter God Realm Ninth Layer, only one step away from breaking through to the God King Realm!</p><p></p><p>In a sense, he can already be internally designated as the next Xuanyuan Holy Son!</p><p></p><p>Among the current younger generation of the major families, there is no one who can match him.</p><p></p><p>He is already one generation ahead of all the major families in strength, and can contend with the previous generation, that is, the fathers of Ning Zhiyuan and the others.</p><p></p><p>According to the elders of the Cloud Family, his future may very well become a Godly Emperor.</p><p></p><p>And this genius of the human world, to be noticed by him and challenged as an enemy, it can be imagined that his talent has already made the Young Master of the Cloud Family feel a sense of threat.</p><p></p><p>That Sword Immortal, he may also have the chance to become the Holy Son!</p><p></p><p>"Unexpectedly, that guy actually has such strength, this is just right, I heard he is in Jianghai City. The aura of the spirit beasts I just sensed is also in Jianghai City."</p><p></p><p>Hearing this, Zhen Wu couldn't help but find it a bit strange.</p><p></p><p>"Elder, could it be that this matter is done by that Sword Immortal?"</p><p></p><p>Cloud Shui chuckled.</p><p></p><p>"You overestimate him. He doesn't have that kind of strength yet. Although his talent is strong, he hasn't grown up yet.</p><p></p><p>Here is the full English translation of the Chinese excerpt:</p><p></p><p>The genius who has not grown up is no different from a waste.</p><p></p><p>The reason why the young master wanted to fight with him was just that he saw his talent.</p><p></p><p>You couldn't really think that he was qualified to fight against the young master, could you?"</p><p></p><p>Yun Zhenwu nodded.</p><p></p><p>"What the elder said is also true."</p><p></p><p>Inside the Jianghai City, Ye Xiao was constantly consuming a large amount of elixirs, continuously enhancing the spiritual energy and blood energy within himself, washing over his limits again and again.</p><p></p><p>Finally, after two days, he completely broke through to the second realm of the Deicide Realm.</p><p></p><p>It seems that in cultivation, refining should be the main focus, with consumption as a supplement.</p><p></p><p>If it weren't for these elixirs, for Ye Xiao to break through to the second realm of the Deicide Realm, it would probably take at least two months, if not three months.</p><p></p><p>Three months may not sound too long, but in reality, it was quite tense for him.</p><p></p><p>Accompanying the opening of one divine tomb after another in the starry sky, the powerful experts attracted would become more and more.</p><p></p><p>The dangers were increasing.</p><p></p><p>Ye Xiao must quickly enhance his own strength.</p><p></p><p>Fortunately, the Divine Book Spiritual Consciousness was very powerful, having already formed three precious techniques and several Nine Star Divine Techniques.</p><p></p><p>With so many accumulated cultivation methods, he could continuously refine these elixirs and the blood and flesh of the star beasts.</p><p></p><p>Normally, a person can only cultivate one or two top-tier cultivation methods, and even that would be the limit.</p><p></p><p>Otherwise, they would not be able to bear it.</p><p></p><p>Even for the divine clans, their talents are limited. If they exceed this numerical limit, it will involve the issue of mental state. If the mental state is unstable, or if the mental state is sufficient, but they cannot cultivate each cultivation method to the limit.</p><p></p><p>For this reason, the circulation of spiritual energy in their bodies and the speed are far inferior to Ye Xiao.</p><p></p><p>The Divine Book Spiritual Consciousness has freed Ye Xiao from this limitation, allowing him to cultivate many cultivation methods simultaneously without worrying about conflicts, mental state issues, or other problems.</p><p></p><p>So he could digest a large amount of elixirs and star beast blood and flesh in a short period of time.</p><p></p><p>Others cannot do this.</p><p></p><p>It's just like the same piece of mud, where a small stream may have to impact it for a long time to clear it, while a large river can clear it in an instant.</p><p></p><p>This is the advantage Ye Xiao has over others.</p><p></p><p>"It's a pity that there is no way to find a few more divine king tombs. If I could find a few more, absorb some divine blood, the effect should be even stronger for me.</p><p></p><p>Of course, if I could have some high-level beast lords come to me, that would also be a good thing."</p><p></p><p>In the early morning, Ye Xiao went out to work, continuing to search for cultivation method combinations in the library.</p><p></p><p>As soon as he went out, he saw several huge spiritual weapon ships in the sky, even larger than the Ning family's spiritual weapon ships.</p><p></p><p>His super-strong vision could clearly see that the side of the spiritual weapon ships had the huge character "Cloud" engraved on them.</p><p></p><p>"The Cloud family?"</p><p></p><p>He retracted his gaze and pondered:</p><p></p><p>"If I'm not mistaken, the Cloud family is the strongest family within the direct lineage of the Xuanyuan Divine Clan. Why would they suddenly appear here?</p><p></p><p>This should be the Ning family's territory."</p><p></p><p>However, he couldn't figure out the reason, shook his head, and didn't think about it anymore.</p><p></p><p>What does it have to do with him?</p><p></p><p>He was just an unassuming library manager.</p><p></p><p>No one would notice him.</p><p></p><p>The huge spiritual weapon ship headed straight for the Ning family's manor, quickly arriving and stopping at the side of the Ning family's manor.</p><p></p><p>Cloud Water and the others descended from the spiritual weapon ship.</p><p></p><p>Ning Zhiyuan and other core members of the Ning family were already waiting to welcome them below.</p><p></p><p>"Senior Cloud, it's been a long time."</p><p></p><p>Ning Zhiyuan's second uncle stood in the front to greet them.</p><p></p><p>His strength was not the strongest among the Ning family manor, but he was currently the highest-ranking Ning family member present.</p><p></p><p>Although Ning Zhiyuan was the young master, his generation was too low, so he had to stand behind the second uncle.</p><p></p><p>Cloud Water chuckled.</p><p></p><p>"Yicheng nephew, it's been a long time. This time I've come without notice, and I've disturbed you, I hope Yicheng nephew doesn't mind?"</p><p></p><p>Ning's second uncle cupped his hands and said:</p><p></p><p>"Senior Cloud, you jest. The various families of the Xuanyuan Divine Clan are all one lineage, we are all family. Since Senior Cloud has come to Jianghai City, we of the Ning family welcome it, how could we mind?"</p><p></p><p>"That's good then. Yicheng nephew, the reason I've come this time is not just for a casual visit, but also with a certain task."</p><p></p><p>Ning's second uncle was slightly puzzled:</p><p></p><p>"What task does Senior Cloud have?"</p><p></p><p>"My Cloud family's young master has ordered me to challenge the Sword and Knife Immortal of Jianghai City."</p><p></p><p>Boom! As soon as this sentence was spoken, it was as if a huge bomb had been dropped in the minds of the crowd!</p><p></p><p>"What! The Cloud young master actually wants to challenge the Sword and Knife Immortal?"</p><p></p><p>"Did I hear that right?"</p><p></p><p>The heartbeats of the crowd couldn't help but accelerate.</p><p></p><p>The young master of the Cloud family, that was who? That was the strongest existence among the younger generation of the entire Xuanyuan Divine Clan!</p>

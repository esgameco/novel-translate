        <h1>Chapter 199</h1>
        <div class="content">
            <p>Here is the full English translation of the Chinese excerpt:</p><p></p><p>In the blink of an eye, he had arrived hundreds of miles away.</p><p></p><p>As soon as he arrived, Ye Xiao's eyes lit up.</p><p></p><p>"It's actually Linglong Flowers!"</p><p></p><p>He quickly descended, in an excellent mood, not expecting to find the Linglong Flowers so soon.</p><p></p><p>The spiritual energy of this flower is extremely abundant, more than three times that of the Purple Youlian and Blazing Sun Flowers! Three times more! What a concept? That means if bees use this flower to make honey, one barrel of honey would be equivalent to three barrels before.</p><p></p><p>There are so many flowers here, if they were all made into honey, it would likely provide a large portion of his cultivation, and he might even be able to break through to the peak of the Innate Eighth Realm, and be able to advance to the Innate Ninth Realm at any time.</p><p></p><p>Ye Xiao immediately activated his spiritual energy and used the Tyrannical Saber to cut down all the Linglong Flowers.</p><p></p><p>He did not cut the flowers at the stem, but severed them from the roots, taking some of the soil as well.</p><p></p><p>The Purple Youlian and Blazing Sun Flowers he had purchased before were just ordinary flowers, not worth the effort to cultivate.</p><p></p><p>But the spiritual energy of the Linglong Flowers needs to be fully utilized, using them just once would be a waste.</p><p></p><p>Since he had traveled so far, he might as well make the most of them.</p><p></p><p>Ye Xiao collected all the Linglong Flowers he could find into his spatial storage ring.</p><p></p><p>The spatial storage ring has more than enough capacity to hold them.</p><p></p><p>If he could reuse these flowers, one batch would allow him to reach the peak of the Innate Eighth Realm, and the second batch would definitely allow him to break through to the Innate Ninth Realm.</p><p></p><p>Calculated this way, he might not even need a week to break through to the Innate Ninth Realm.</p><p></p><p>Perfect.</p><p></p><p>However, at this moment, an unexpected event occurred, the entire forest suddenly began to tremble.</p><p></p><p>"What's this?"</p><p></p><p>Ye Xiao's brow furrowed as he scanned the area with his Profound Heaven Qi.</p><p></p><p>He soon discovered the source of the abnormality.</p><p></p><p>It was the star beasts in the center of the forest that had gone into a frenzy, countless star beasts seemed to be attracted by some special force, rushing and colliding wildly in the forest.</p><p></p><p>Many cultivators had been thrown off rhythm by this, either fleeing quickly or fighting for their lives.</p><p></p><p>As for those who couldn't run fast or fight back, they could only wait to die.</p><p></p><p>These star beasts had gone into a sudden frenzy, and Ye Xiao hadn't even reacted yet when he sensed some people being devoured alive, without even a chance of revival.</p><p></p><p>The next moment, several figures with powerful auras suddenly burst out from the forest.</p><p></p><p>They were star beasts, with strength at least at the Grand Master realm.</p><p></p><p>Their eyes were bloodshot, covered in blood vessels, panting heavily, and rushing towards Ye Xiao with murderous intent.</p><p></p><p>A few star beasts left, leaving peacefully.</p><p></p><p>But it was not Ye Xiao who struck them down, but several invisible forces descending from the sky that instantly annihilated them.</p><p></p><p>"Is that you?"</p><p></p><p>After the star beasts were slain, a very pleasant and melodious voice suddenly appeared in Ye Xiao's ear.</p><p></p><p>Immediately following, a white figure slowly descended, it was actually the masked girl.</p><p></p><p>Ye Xiao was not surprised by her strength, as he had already sensed her cultivation was not weak before.</p><p></p><p>He just didn't expect her to appear here.</p><p></p><p>The other party also clearly didn't expect to run into him here, and her gaze towards Ye Xiao now carried a hint of vigilance.</p><p></p><p>Ye Xiao did not speak, he was usually not very talkative with unfamiliar strangers, especially with women.</p><p></p><p>"It seems you have hidden your strength, actually being able to shield my exploration, your strength is truly remarkable. And you're still so young, are you really of the human race?"</p><p></p><p>"You're also so young and strong, aren't you of the human race as well?"</p><p></p><p>A trace of arrogance flashed in the girl's eyes, but she did not respond to Ye Xiao.</p><p></p><p>It was obvious that she was not of the human race, and she disdained to casually reveal her race to a stranger.</p><p></p><p>This was quite interesting.</p><p></p><p>Her aura was neither that of a beastman, nor did she have the aura of a star beast, but she was also not human.</p><p></p><p>In this world, there could actually be such strange people? What's even more puzzling is that she could reach such cultivation at such a young age.</p><p></p><p>It seems her identity is not simple at all.</p><p></p><p>At the same time, a black lightning bolt suddenly shot out from the forest, rushing towards the girl.</p><p></p><p>It was a Sixth Realm star bat, its fangs glittering with a bloodthirsty chill, still stained with yellow neural toxin.</p><p></p><p>Ye Xiao snapped his finger, activating the Infinite Calamity Finger, instantly blasting the black bat to pieces.</p><p></p><p>"All settled."</p><p></p><p>Ye Xiao said indifferently, turning to leave.</p><p></p><p>The girl's eyes flickered, obviously somewhat interested in Ye Xiao's strength.</p><p></p><p>"It seems you're looking for flowers, aren't you?"</p><p></p><p>Ye Xiao stopped in his tracks and glanced back at her.</p><p></p><p>The girl spoke again.</p><p></p><p>"I'm also here to find flowers, but the ones I'm looking for are much stronger than yours. Even if you pick a hundred or a thousand of those, it wouldn't be as good as one of the ones I'm looking for. How about considering a collaboration with me?"</p><p></p><p>Ye Xiao pondered for a moment, then spoke:</p><p></p><p>"Explain first."</p><p></p><p>"Have you heard of the Myriad Purple Thousand Red Leaf?"</p><p></p><p>Ye Xiao nodded.</p><p></p><p>"Then what else?"</p><p></p><p>"In fact, the Myriad Purple Thousand Red Leaf, although called the Flower King, has differences.</p><p></p><p>The lowest-grade Myriad Purple Thousand Red Leaf only has one color, and it can...</p><p></p><p>Here is the full English translation of the Chinese excerpt:</p><p></p><p>Elevate to the Nine-Colored! <div class="contentadv"><script>loadAdv(7,3);</script></div>When the myriad-colored leaves grow to a certain extent, they will possess power comparable to that of a powerful human race warrior.</p><p></p><p>At the moment, in this sea of forests, there is a myriad-colored leaf that has already accumulated spiritual energy to the level of a human race innate eighth-grade warrior.</p><p></p><p>Moreover, it is about to break through. If it is allowed to make one final breakthrough, reaching the level of a human race innate ninth-grade, it will activate some special abilities. At that time, trying to find it would be like finding a needle in a haystack.</p><p></p><p>I came here this time specifically to find it.</p><p></p><p>Its intelligence is very high, using the pollen on its body to cause chaos among the star beasts, and it has likely gathered many powerful star beasts around it.</p><p></p><p>I originally thought that my own strength would be sufficient to deal with it, but judging from the current situation, it seems that may not be the case.</p><p></p><p>How about it? Would you consider cooperating with me? If we succeed, I will give you a generous reward."</p><p></p><p>Ye Xiao replied indifferently:</p><p></p><p>"What can you give me?"</p><p></p><p>"Many things, materials, herbs, elixirs. As long as the price is right, I can give you whatever you want."</p><p></p><p>Ye Xiao was no fool. The myriad-colored leaf has already been called the Flower King. If there is a myriad-colored leaf that has cultivated to the extreme, its value would be unmatched by ordinary things.</p><p></p><p>"I want to split the myriad-colored leaf with you equally."</p><p></p><p>"What did you say!"</p><p></p><p>The woman was taken aback, and her expression immediately turned grave.</p><p></p><p>Ye Xiao spoke again:</p><p></p><p>"You don't need to try to trick me with other things. I only want the myriad-colored leaf."</p><p></p><p>The woman stared intently at Ye Xiao, remained silent for a long time, and then finally spoke:</p><p></p><p>"Alright! I agree."</p><p></p><p>She slowly descended.</p><p></p><p>"My name is Xia Bingning. What's your name? Don't say it's Bear, that definitely isn't your name."</p><p></p><p>"Xia Bingbao!"</p><p></p><p>Xia Bingning stared fixedly at Ye Xiao, and in her beautiful eyes, a trace of slight anger could be seen.</p><p></p><p>Ye Xiao cleared his throat and spoke again:</p><p></p><p>"My name is Ye Liangchen."</p><p></p><p>Hearing this normal-sounding name, Xia Bingning finally believed Ye Xiao.</p><p></p><p>"From now on, we two are teammates."</p><p></p><p>"What do we do next?"</p><p></p><p>"I'll first locate its position, and then we'll make the next move."</p><p></p><p>With that, Xia Bingning simply formed two seals with her fingers, and the next moment, a faint golden wave emanated from her eyes, rapidly expanding outward.</p><p></p><p>Again, the eyes!</p><p></p><p>Ye Xiao observed quietly.</p><p></p><p>He had already noticed several times that this woman's techniques were all manifested through her eyes.</p><p></p><p>Previously, she had used her eyes to attack, and now she was using her eyes to search.</p><p></p><p>It had a sense of spiritual power combined with martial cultivation.</p><p></p><p>This was the first time he had seen such a technique. The books in the Martial Arts Library that he had read through did not mention any techniques that used the eyes to manifest.</p><p></p><p>This girl was indeed quite novel.</p><p></p><p>"I found it! It should have already learned the art of compressing the earth into an inch, or perhaps it has learned the Earth Form Technique, and its aura is still continuously strengthening.</p><p></p><p>We need to hurry."</p><p></p><p>With that, Xia Bingning flew swiftly towards the direction she had determined, and Ye Xiao, with a thought, followed closely behind.</p><p></p><p>In the forest, there were endless cries of agony, but they were not human, they were the cries of star beasts.</p><p></p><p>Evidently, the powerful cultivators stationed in the sea of forests and the Nine Heavens Defense Force had taken action.</p><p></p><p>Ye Xiao followed Xia Bingning and quickly arrived at a small hill in the center of the sea of forests. Xia Bingning looked at the earthen slope below.</p><p></p><p>"It's underneath there."</p><p></p><p>Ye Xiao's spiritual sense swept over, and sure enough, beneath the small hill, there was an extremely powerful aura, continuously absorbing and strengthening.</p><p></p><p>However, what Ye Xiao did not expect was that around this earthen slope, there were also many climbing flowers and other flower species, each of which was a quite excellent spiritual energy flower, very suitable for making honey.</p><p></p><p>"You wait up here, I'll use the Earth Escape Technique to go down and see if I can flush it out. If I can flush it out, you must be careful not to let it escape. Your strength may not be enough to suppress it, but as long as you can obstruct it for a moment, it will give me enough time to capture it.</p><p></p><p>I'll take the lead, and you'll provide support."</p><p></p><p>Ye Xiao nodded. Coincidentally, there were flowers all over the mountain, so he might as well take the opportunity to pick them all and store them in his spatial ring.</p><p></p><p>Since the other party didn't allow him to participate, it had nothing to do with him anyway.</p><p></p><p>Xia Bingning, seeing his agreement, immediately plunged into the mountain rock and began to deal with the Flower King - the myriad-colored leaf beneath.</p><p></p><p>As for Ye Xiao, he descended, and began to collect the flowers.</p><p></p><p>The Heavenly Sword Slash was unleashed, and the sword beams frantically split the ground, collecting all the fresh flowers around him into his spatial ring.</p><p></p><p>At the same time, the sounds of battle began to rise from below.</p><p></p><p>The ground started to tremble slightly.</p>

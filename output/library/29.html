        <h1>Chapter 29</h1>
        <div class="content">
            <p>Here is the full English translation of the Chinese excerpt:</p><p></p><p>After all, his resume was indeed very impressive, as he had swept through the top sword art talents in the capital city of Kyoto.</p><p></p><p>But now he has joined the Jiangcheng Martial Arts Academy, which clearly shows that the Jiangcheng Martial Arts Academy is very outstanding, right? Therefore, the parents in Jiangcheng and the surrounding cities have all included the Jiangcheng Martial Arts Academy in their plans when enrolling their children for the fall semester.</p><p></p><p>As for the matter of the sword mark on the Golden Bull, it was suppressed by Qin Shenglong using some special methods.</p><p></p><p>The Golden Bull was also pulled back to the academy, and only the students with relatively good sword art aptitude were allowed to watch.</p><p></p><p>This is also for the protection of those students, because if the aptitude is not enough, it is very easy to go astray.</p><p></p><p>In his spare time, he would find Pu Jiansheng to practice swordsmanship, ostensibly to guide and instruct him, but in reality, he was trying to extract everything Pu Jiansheng had learned from the Sword Saint Liu Chengxun.</p><p></p><p>In just a few days, Jianghai City had regained its peace.</p><p></p><p>But in the hearts of many people in Jianghai City, two facts had already taken root: First, Jianghai City has a peerless swordsman whose cultivation is extremely strong; Second, Jianghai City has a sword art master whose sword techniques are extraordinary.</p><p></p><p>Although no one knows who these two people are, many have already regarded them as their idols.</p><p></p><p>Even the Jianghai City government has a hint of intentionally riding the wave of popularity, as simple drawings of the swordsman and the sword art master can be found on many public facilities in Jianghai City.</p><p></p><p>This undoubtedly makes everyone more firmly believe that Jianghai City truly has two super experts, one with the sword and one with the blade, whose cultivation is at least at the Divine Ancestor level.</p><p></p><p>Ye Xiao was not interested.</p><p></p><p>Whether it's the peerless swordsman or the extraordinary sword art master, they are nothing more than empty titles.</p><p></p><p>If the masses want to rely on them spiritually, then let them be. But to get him to come out and acknowledge it, that's impossible.</p><p></p><p>Because his current cultivation is not even at the Divine Ancestor level.</p><p></p><p>If he were to admit it, a horde of challengers would come, and he would end up dead, wouldn't he?</p><p></p><p>In the one month's time, Ye Xiao's life was the same as before - home to the library, back and forth, a slow and leisurely pace.</p><p></p><p>Except for Qin Yueyan borrowing and returning books, no one else had much contact with him.</p><p></p><p>Gu Hai, since he had a girlfriend and was also preparing for the defense team exam, had less and less presence on the third floor.</p><p></p><p>This gave Ye Xiao more time to read books.</p><p></p><p>He had already gathered six books on the mental cultivation method, but mental cultivation methods are truly rare, so he still couldn't find another one.</p><p></p><p>It's a good thing Ye Xiao is not impatient, otherwise he would have died of anxiety.</p><p></p><p>Looking at it this way, the Golden Book of the Divine Soul is quite suitable for him. No need to cultivate, just read the book, and the rest will be automatically taken care of, quite perfect!</p><p></p><p>A month later, Gu Hai's wedding was held. Ye Xiao attended as a groomsman.</p><p></p><p>Not only did he have to pay money, but he also had to work. </p><p></p><p>After arriving, he and the other groomsmen went to the styling room of the wedding team, where the stylists dressed them up and changed them into suits.</p><p></p><p>It wasn't long before the other well-dressed groomsmen walked out of the room, grumbling.</p><p></p><p>Gu Hai was puzzled.</p><p></p><p>"What's wrong with you guys?"</p><p></p><p>"I say, Gu Hai, were you deliberately trying to make us look bad?"</p><p></p><p>"Yeah, what's the deal with you bringing that Ye Xiao?"</p><p></p><p>Gu Hai was completely confused.</p><p></p><p>"Did Old Ye bully you guys? No way, Old Ye is a very honest person, he's never bullied anyone."</p><p></p><p>"Nonsense! He didn't even have to bully us. Just by standing there, we all became the supporting cast."</p><p></p><p>Gu Hai was somewhat amused and distressed.</p><p></p><p>He knew Ye Xiao was good-looking, but not to such an exaggerated extent, right?</p><p></p><p>But just then, Ye Xiao...</p><p></p><p>Here is the full English translation of the Chinese excerpt:</p><p></p><p>He also walked out of the room.</p><p></p><p>Gu Hai's expression on his face instantly froze.</p><p></p><p>"Fuck!"</p><p></p><p>The library usually didn't require wearing suits, so although Ye Xiao looked good, his temperament wasn't fully highlighted. But today, the wedding planning team not only styled him, trimmed his eyebrows, but also put him in an extremely smart little suit.</p><p></p><p>Completely showcasing Ye Xiao's handsome side.</p><p></p><p>It's not to the point of being devastatingly handsome, but he can definitely compete with the stars on TV.</p><p></p><p>Ye Xiao felt a bit embarrassed being stared at by everyone, and cleared his throat.</p><p></p><p>"Shall I leave?"</p><p></p><p>"No, don't worry. Looking good isn't your fault, it's your parents' fault. Let's go, the wedding is about to start."</p><p></p><p>Ye Xiao nodded.</p><p></p><p>The bride had already been received at the hotel, and the guests on both sides were all arranged at the hotel.</p><p></p><p>As soon as they arrived at the floor where the wedding was being held, Gu Hai and the other groomsmen hadn't even had a chance to go in, when some guests on the bride's side who hadn't seen Gu Hai before had their gazes converging on Ye Xiao.</p><p></p><p>"Is he the groom? He's so handsome!"</p><p>"He looks so good, like a TV star. The Lu family's daughter is so lucky!"</p><p>"There's also a classmate of the Lu family's daughter coming as a bridesmaid, and she's very beautiful too."</p><p>"I think they should be the couple, the Lu family's daughter is not worthy of this young man's looks."</p><p></p><p>Gu Hai's face turned black.</p><p></p><p>The other groomsmen beside him sighed:</p><p></p><p>"It would have been better if we hadn't let him come over."</p><p></p><p>Gu Hai cleared his throat, ignoring the embarrassment, and led the group to enter and hold the wedding ceremony.</p><p></p><p>As soon as they went in, the host in charge of hosting the wedding immediately pulled Ye Xiao aside.</p><p></p><p>"Why are you just arriving? We've been waiting for you for a long time, hurry up and go rehearse the lines, we'll need them later."</p><p></p><p>Gu Hai's face turned even darker.</p><p></p><p>Ye Xiao embarrassedly pointed to his boutonniere.</p><p></p><p>"I'm the groomsman, he's the groom."</p><p></p><p>The host immediately laughed.</p><p></p><p>"Haha, I got it wrong, sorry, sorry."</p><p></p><p>Fortunately, it was a joyous occasion today, so Gu Hai didn't bother the other party.</p><p></p><p>After muttering a few words, everyone hurriedly went in to avoid delaying the auspicious time.</p><p></p><p>After going in, Gu Hai first found his wife, held her hand, and proclaimed his ownership.</p><p></p><p>Feeling the gaze of the crowd finally converge on himself, his mood finally improved a lot.</p><p></p><p>Old Lu saw his smug expression and his face darkened, feeling like the cabbage he had raised for many years had been rooted up by a pig.</p><p></p><p>A hint of disgust was revealed in his helplessness.</p><p></p><p>However, when he saw the dashing Ye Xiao among the groomsmen, he felt even more like crying without tears.</p><p></p><p>Damn it, why didn't I let my daughter get to know Ye Xiao earlier? If my daughter had gotten to know Ye Xiao earlier, she would have definitely been won over by him, and wouldn't have ended up in Gu Hai's hands.</p><p></p><p>Not to mention Ye Xiao's outstanding appearance, at least he doesn't go to red light districts! Looking at Gu Hai again, his heart ached even more.</p><p></p><p>This loss was a big one! Ye Xiao greeted him with a wave, then discreetly hid in the corner to avoid stealing the spotlight from the newlyweds.</p><p></p><p>"Phew!"</p><p></p><p>He let out a mouthful of foul air, finally feeling relieved.</p><p></p><p>But at this moment, a familiar voice suddenly sounded in his ear.</p><p></p><p>"You're here too."</p><p></p><p>(This chapter ends)</p>

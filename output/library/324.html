        <h1>Chapter 324</h1>
        <div class="content">
            <p>Here is the full English translation of the Chinese excerpt:</p><p></p><p>Due to the large-scale movement of the Star Beast Legion, a series of violent winds surged in from the gates of the Nine Provinces, bringing with them a series of ear-piercing howls.</p><p></p><p>Directly experiencing this massive impact, the people of the Nine Provinces on the battlefield could not help but feel their hearts pounding, and even those watching from the screens, not present on the battlefield, felt an oppressive, suffocating sensation that made their hearts tremble.</p><p></p><p>This second wave of Star Beasts was far, far stronger than the previous one. In terms of both numbers and strength, they carried an even more overwhelming sense of domination!</p><p></p><p>The howling winds, like giant waves in the sea, constantly blew Ye Xiao's clothes, making them flutter rapidly backwards, but the roar of the wind was so deafening that the sound of the clothes flapping was completely drowned out and could not be heard.</p><p></p><p>At this moment, the crowd looked at Ye Xiao with even greater admiration. Even facing such tremendous pressure, he had not retreated a single step. That figure stood firmly guarding the gates of the Nine Provinces, like a god of war descended to earth.</p><p></p><p>The next moment, he finally moved again. Accompanied by a rising sword intent, a shocking sword beam once again appeared above Ye Xiao's head. It was still the Heavenly Opening.</p><p></p><p>Because Lie Di had not yet been completely cultivated to the realm of great perfection by the Golden Book Shen Hun.</p><p></p><p>The sword broke out, piercing straight into the clouds, radiating a distance of over a million zhang. The golden sword beam even illuminated the entire earth, allowing some of the people in the west of the Nine Provinces to see this golden light shooting up into the sky.</p><p></p><p>The next moment, the sword beam fell.</p><p></p><p>Boom! Another earth-shattering roar, followed by another burst of light, illuminating everything and making everyone's eyes unable to see clearly.</p><p></p><p>The light continued for dozens of seconds, and after dozens of seconds, the light disappeared, and all the Star Beasts vanished without a trace.</p><p></p><p>The earth returned to calm, as if nothing had ever happened. Only a sword mark spreading out for a million zhang, like a bottomless abyss, testified to the stunning power of that previous sword strike.</p><p></p><p>"Good!" The Xuanwu Venerable and Beitang Ce exclaimed the word "good" in unison. The two elders' eyes were reddened with excitement and emotion. The Nine Provinces had Ye Xiao, and could thus remain safe and secure! At this time, both the strong ones behind and the strong ones watching on the screens could not help but cheer repeatedly.</p><p></p><p>"Senior Sword Immortal is truly divine!" "I love him!" "To be able to witness such a powerful figure and such a heroic battle in this lifetime, I have no regrets!" "The heavens have blessed the Nine Provinces!"</p><p></p><p>Amid the chorus of praise, Ye Xiao continued to eliminate wave after wave of Star Beasts, the number of Star Beasts killed by his hand rising to an unimaginable and terrifying degree.</p><p></p><p>Ten million! Twenty million! Thirty million! Forty million! In the blink of an eye, it had already exceeded a hundred million, and this number was still rising.</p><p></p><p>One hundred million! Two hundred million! Three hundred million! Four hundred million! Five hundred million!</p><p></p><p>Ye Xiao had gone berserk in his killing. No matter how many Star Beasts appeared, he would kill them all.</p><p></p><p>As long as they appeared within his line of sight, not a single one could escape his attacks.</p><p></p><p>While slaughtering, Ye Xiao's heart was also bleeding. What a waste of food! After all, among these Star Beasts, there were many at the Deity Sect level, half-step Deity Beasts, and even a few that had already reached the Deity Beast level. What a heartbreaking thing.</p><p></p><p>If he could collect them all, he could make his breeding farm so prosperous that he could eat different kinds of fish and eggs every day. Just thinking about it made him feel extravagant.</p><p></p><p>However, the people of the Nine Provinces behind him were the truly important ones.</p><p></p><p>But at this moment, Ye Xiao suddenly thought of something. If he couldn't catch them in front of the national gate, could he create some spiritual energy clones?</p><p></p><p>Spiritual energy clones had a certain time limit and spiritual energy limit, but at least with his current Emperor Realm Eight Dragons cultivation, the spiritual energy clones he created should be several times stronger than the ones he created when he first reached the Emperor Realm.</p><p></p><p>They should have reached the level of Emperor Realm entry. This level of spiritual energy clone should have a greatly increased endurance time and considerable strength. They would be a very good choice to go out and capture those super-large Star Beasts.</p><p></p><p>Ye Xiao's habit was to act as soon as he thought of something. So the next moment, he directly divided out four spiritual energy clones.</p><p></p><p>The crowd was startled.</p><p></p><p>"What, the Sword Immortal can also perform the legendary clone technique? Is this a cultivation method? Isn't this already a divine immortal's technique? Could the Sword Immortal really be the legendary immortal?"</p><p></p><p>Some who had already reached the Deity Sect level were full of reverence and awe.</p><p></p><p>Here is the full English translation of the Chinese novel excerpt:</p><p></p><p>The strong one couldn't help but explain:</p><p></p><p>"You don't understand, so don't talk nonsense. This is actually a spiritual energy clone! As long as the strength reaches the peak of the Divine Sect, the spiritual power has been cultivated to a very profound level. It can then unleash a spiritual energy clone.</p><p></p><p>They will differentiate a wisp of spiritual power in the clone to control it.</p><p></p><p>But this kind of clone is not the main body, the strength is still much weaker compared to the main body."</p><p></p><p>"I see. Unexpectedly, even above the Divine Sect, there is such a powerful technique, it's really an eye-opener!"</p><p></p><p>"However, Senior Immortal Sword and Saber, why did you suddenly unleash the clone at this time? The strength of the clone is not as strong as the main body, so it would be better to concentrate all your power on the main body to fight."</p><p></p><p>"The one above, do you think you're so smart? Using your unprofessional words to challenge the tactics of Senior Immortal Sword and Saber, that great figure?"</p><p></p><p>The next moment, the people saw several clones of Ye Xiao quickly fly out in all directions.</p><p></p><p>Someone couldn't help but raise a question.</p><p></p><p>"You think, could it be that Senior Immortal Sword and Saber is planning to take the initiative to attack the Star Beasts in other places?"</p><p></p><p>As soon as this was said, the entire scene exploded again. Everyone was boiling.</p><p></p><p>"Fuck! Is this for real? This can't be a joke, right? The other states have suffered heavy losses and are almost completely destroyed due to their inability to resist.</p><p></p><p>Senior Immortal Sword and Saber, instead of guarding the gate, is directly taking the initiative to attack!"</p><p></p><p>"Senior, are you perhaps a little too excited? I've heard that there are even Super Divine Realm Star Beasts out there! Don't go overboard!"</p><p></p><p>Qinglong smiled wryly.</p><p></p><p>"As expected of him, this kid, he really makes one have to admire him!"</p><p></p><p>Xuanwu laughed:</p><p></p><p>"We're old now, all of us! The waves behind push the waves in front, and the front waves are washed up on the beach. Now is the era of the young people."</p><p></p><p>Baihu shook his head.</p><p></p><p>"Brother Xuanwu, that sentence is not quite right. This is not the era of the young people, this is the era of Ye Xiao alone."</p><p></p><p>At this time, before the next wave of Star Beasts arrived, someone suddenly posted a message online.</p><p></p><p>"Senior Immortal Sword and Saber's clone has reached Yingzhou! He has reached Yingzhou!"</p><p></p><p>The people were startled.</p><p></p><p>"Fuck! You can't be joking, right? It's only been a few seconds? How is it possible to reach Yingzhou so fast? This speed is too fast, isn't it?"</p><p></p><p>"It's true! On the Yingzhou side, there are still a few surviving human beings. They just posted a short video a few seconds ago."</p><p></p><p>"What are you talking about? Yingzhou has been destroyed, the cities have been devastated! How can there still be the internet? And how can they upload videos?"</p><p></p><p>"Liar! At a time like this, what's the point of playing these tricks?"</p><p></p><p>"It's true, I'm not lying to you. Yingzhou still has a few base stations that haven't been destroyed, and they're using underwater fiber optic cables for transmission, as there aren't many Star Beasts in the ocean yet, so the cables haven't been damaged.</p><p></p><p>The regular web pages definitely won't work, because the companies behind them have all been destroyed.</p><p></p><p>Use those, you often see. Yingzhou not too cold, three da bu liu dot OO dot com, nine six minus five. Use these web pages to see it."</p><p></p><p>"Fuck! May good people live forever!"</p><p></p><p>"Great god 666!"</p><p></p><p>"Please give a good person a website."</p><p></p><p>Some martial arts experts who had cultivated for many years and were not involved in the mundane world couldn't help but wonder, "What kind of strange websites are these? I've never heard of them before."</p><p></p><p>Soon, some quite professional people found Ye Xiao's video.</p><p></p><p>The distance was very far, because if it was too close, it would be impossible to film Ye Xiao due to the spiritual energy magnetic field.</p><p></p><p>They could only film from very, very far away, and since there were still Star Beasts around, the shooting angles were all sneaky.</p><p></p><p>But everyone could still recognize the figure in the video at a glance.</p><p></p><p>That aura, it was simply unforgettable, and they could tell at a glance that it was Ye Xiao's clone!</p><p></p><p>At this moment, Ye Xiao's clone was like a divine warrior, slaying gods and Buddhas! "Fuck! Is Senior Immortal Sword and Saber this awesome?"</p><p></p><p>"In just a few seconds, he reached Yingzhou. At this rate, is he going to single-handedly break through the entire world?"</p><p></p><p>"There are also videos from the West, Senior Immortal Sword and Saber really has reached the West. There's a website - three da bu liu dot oh mei dot com! This website has the video."</p><p></p><p>At this moment, the people of the Nine States were boiling up again.</p><p></p><p>Ye Xiao, with just a few clones, directly broke through the entire world! This guy, does he have to be so monstrous? They couldn't think of any words of praise to describe Ye Xiao anymore!</p><p></p><p>This guy has completely exhausted their vocabulary.</p><p></p><p>However, at this moment, on the distant horizon, the silhouettes of Star Beasts appeared again.</p><p></p><p>But this time, it was not a large-scale appearance, but only three.</p><p></p><p>Yet these three, their aura was more oppressive than the hundreds of millions of Star Beasts before.</p><p></p><p>Some Divine Sect experts at the forefront had to quickly retreat to ensure their bodies could withstand the pressure.</p><p></p><p>"Star Beasts again!"</p><p></p><p>"So strong!"</p><p></p><p>"This time the Star Beasts are not many in number, but the aura is truly powerful! I feel my heartbeat involuntarily rising, and I'm already at the peak of the Primal Sage Realm! They're still so far away, not even in front of us yet."</p><p></p><p>Qinglong and the others narrowed their eyes.</p><p></p><p>"They're here! Super Divine Realm Star Beasts!"</p><p></p><p>"And three of them came at once!"</p><p></p><p>(End of this chapter)</p>

        <h1>Chapter 362</h1>
        <div class="content">
            <p>Here is the full English translation of the Chinese excerpt:</p><p></p><p>Ye Xiao: "(_..)!"</p><p></p><p>He furrowed his brows tightly, and his whole person seemed a bit at a loss.</p><p></p><p>After his full-force investigation these past few days, he found that the formation techniques were not at the treasure art level.</p><p></p><p>That's right, the highest rank of formation techniques was only the Nine-Star Divine Formation.</p><p></p><p>This left him a bit puzzled.</p><p></p><p>Healing arts, alchemy, and weapon forging - these all seemed to be able to be combined into treasure arts, so why couldn't formation techniques do the same? Analyzing this situation, Ye Xiao could only say that no matter how powerful the formation techniques were, they couldn't surpass the consciousness of people.</p><p></p><p>Especially those peerless geniuses who possessed treasure arts - to restrain them, what kind of formidable formation techniques would be required? </p><p></p><p>And how many spirit crystals would it take to set up? If the cost was too high, there might not be many people in this world who could afford it.</p><p></p><p>If someone could afford to set up a formation that, relying only on a certain amount of spirit crystal resources, could defeat treasure arts, then treasure arts would become worthless.</p><p></p><p>So this was a very troubling issue.</p><p></p><p>Perhaps that was precisely why there were no formation techniques at the treasure art level in the heavens and earth?</p><p></p><p>Oh well, let it be. The heavens didn't produce them, and he couldn't obtain them either.</p><p></p><p>He should focus on cultivation and try to raise his own strength as much as possible.</p><p></p><p>Fortunately, a few days later, Ye Xiao had completely cultivated his treasure art to the Great Perfection realm.</p><p></p><p>At the moment the Annihilation Treasure Art was successfully fused, Ye Xiao's cultivation also broke through.</p><p></p><p>Boom!</p><p></p><p>He reached the Second Realm of the Divine Realm.</p><p></p><p>Above the Divine Realm, just like the Innate Realm, it was divided into nine small realms.</p><p></p><p>Although they were called "small realms", the increase in each realm was comparable to the amount of spiritual energy required to break through to the Divine Realm previously.</p><p></p><p>Of course, this did not mean it would take as long as reaching the Divine Realm.</p><p></p><p>At least not for Ye Xiao.</p><p></p><p>Because after the increase in strength, the speed of absorbing spiritual energy would also accelerate. And there was another reason related to his cultivation method.</p><p></p><p>Ordinary people only cultivated divine arts, and the vast majority of them could not even use the Nine-Star Divine Arts, having at most a One-Star Divine Art was already remarkable.</p><p></p><p>For example, Ning Zhiyuan - why was the Ning Clan willing to let him go out to temper himself? One of the reasons was that his divine blood and divine soul were also possessed by the Ning Clan, so if he encountered any mishaps, the Ning Clan could revive him again.</p><p></p><p>But the other reason was even more important.</p><p></p><p>That was, the cultivation method he practiced in the early stage was not the Nine-Star Emperor Art, which meant that even if he was captured by others and had his soul searched, he would not reveal the Ning Clan's secrets.</p><p></p><p>Not only Ning Zhiyuan, but almost all the tribes in the starry sky used this method.</p><p></p><p>This could greatly reduce the chance of their heirs being killed.</p><p></p><p>Killing these heirs was equivalent to slapping their faces, and it was also meaningless.</p><p></p><p>It was also for this reason that their cultivation speed might be a little slower than breaking through from the Emperor Realm to the Divine Realm, but not much slower, and there was no hope of being faster.</p><p></p><p>In contrast, Ye Xiao, like others, had strengthened his physical body and increased the speed of absorbing spiritual energy, and he had also cultivated several Nine-Star Divine Arts, even adding an Ancient Treasure Art.</p><p></p><p>This was equivalent to everyone having the same spirit gathering formation, but others had no spirit stones, so the absorption speed was very slow, while Ye Xiao not only had them, but also a pile of spirit crystals.</p><p></p><p>The gap between them was naturally self-evident.</p><p></p><p>It was only natural that Ye Xiao successfully broke through to the Second Realm of the Divine Realm in just over a month after breaking through to the Divine Realm.</p><p></p><p>This made Ye Xiao's mood much more comfortable.</p><p></p><p>Although he didn't get good results in the formation techniques, he got some compensation in terms of his own strength. It could be considered quite perfect.</p><p></p><p>The only thing that was not quite satisfactory was that he currently had no way to test the power of the Ancient Treasure Art - the Annihilation Treasure Art.</p><p></p><p>This treasure art must be extremely powerful, but how powerful exactly, he did not know.</p><p></p><p>When he was still a Patriarch, he had caused a huge sword mark, which had attracted the attention of many people.</p><p></p><p>Now Ye Xiao was much more mature and would not do something so revealing.</p><p></p><p>He would be more stable in his actions.</p><p></p><p>Anyway, there would be an opportunity to test it in the future.</p><p></p><p>He sent a message underground, asking the spirit beasts to speed up the mining progress, abandoning large-scale mining, and focusing on one path.</p><p></p><p>He wanted to dig a tunnel to enter the Divine Realm's treasure vault first and collect those treasures.</p><p></p><p>He was not sure if he could take all the spirit crystals, but the treasures in the treasure vault were more valuable than the spirit crystals.</p><p></p><p>After giving this order, Ye Xiao began to search for the remaining divine art of healing.</p><p></p><p>This second synthesized divine art, which included both defensive power and healing power, would definitely be beneficial to improving his own combat power or survival chances when it was combined into a treasure art.</p><p></p><p>That noon, Ye Xiao was reading a book when North Hall Ce appeared smilingly in front of him.</p><p></p><p>"Ye Xiao, still reading books?"</p><p></p><p>Ye Xiao was startled and looked up, a bit strange.</p><p></p><p>"Senior North Hall, weren't you all going to the starry sky to dig graves? How come you're here?"</p><p></p><p>North Hall Ce smiled. "..."</p><p></p><p>Here is my translation of the Chinese excerpt you provided:</p><p></p><p>"How can we dig graves every day? The experts of the Xuanyuan Clan don't want to exhaust us, so they let us take breaks every so often to return to the human world and cultivate, as well as relax a bit."</p><p></p><p>"I see."</p><p></p><p>Beitang Ce then took out a storage ring and placed it in front of Ye Xiao.</p><p></p><p>"This is for you."</p><p></p><p>"This is...spirit crystals? And some pills?"</p><p></p><p>Ye Xiao was somewhat taken aback.</p><p></p><p>"Why did you suddenly decide to give me these things?"</p><p></p><p>"It's not just me giving you these. Jing Di, Qinglong, Zhu Que, Li Liushui, and LÃ¼ Qingshan also contributed. </p><p></p><p>We've been digging graves in the starry sky and can get 20% of the earnings. Each of us can get several hundred or even over a thousand spirit crystals per day, as well as some pills and such.</p><p></p><p>We've saved up all these resources, keeping half for our own cultivation, and leaving the other half for you.</p><p></p><p>You are the hope of our Jiuzhou human race, and the hope of all of us. But now you can't casually reveal your identity, so it must be difficult for you to obtain cultivation resources. So we're giving you these to help with your cultivation."</p><p></p><p>Ye Xiao was stunned, feeling warmth in his heart.</p><p></p><p>Ever since the descent of the Xuanyuan Clan, they were no longer the lofty existences of the past, just disciples of various sects.</p><p></p><p>Yet, every bit of their resources was hard-earned through their own efforts. And even so, they still wanted to share some with him to help with his cultivation.</p><p></p><p>Leaving aside other considerations, just this gesture of goodwill was enough for Ye Xiao to remember forever.</p><p></p><p>He smiled and pushed the storage ring back.</p><p></p><p>"I don't need these things. I have a way to obtain them. You keep them and use them for your own cultivation. Focus on quickly improving your cultivation."</p><p></p><p>Beitang Ce was somewhat taken aback.</p><p></p><p>"You can obtain them? From where? You can't even reveal your identity now."</p><p></p><p>He still doubted that Ye Xiao was just being polite.</p><p></p><p>"You don't need to be so courteous with us. As long as you can improve your own cultivation, we'll be satisfied. Don't worry about the rest, leave it to us to figure out."</p><p></p><p>Ye Xiao couldn't help but deeply appreciate them in his heart.</p><p></p><p>These senior predecessors were truly adorable! Each of them wanted to see him succeed, to go higher and further.</p><p></p><p>"Senior Beitang, I'm really not being polite. Don't worry, I definitely have a way to obtain the resources. Look at your storage ring."</p><p></p><p>Beitang Ce had a puzzled expression, taking back his storage ring.</p><p></p><p>However, when he saw the contents of the storage ring, his expression changed instantly.</p><p></p><p>"My goodness! How can there be so many spirit crystals? Where did you find these?"</p><p></p><p>Beitang Ce couldn't help but exclaim in surprise.</p><p></p><p>The amount inside was simply too much, over ten times what he had given Ye Xiao.</p><p></p><p>In fact, this was some spirit crystals that Ye Xiao had just generously placed in there, feeling moved. For him, these were like sprinkling water, completely insignificant.</p><p></p><p>"I can't tell you that for now. I'll explain it to you all another time.</p><p></p><p>You tell Senior Jing Di and the others that all of you must cultivate well, and don't let me hold back your cultivation."</p><p></p><p>Beitang Ce smiled awkwardly.</p><p></p><p>"How embarrassing. We originally wanted to help you, but ended up being helped by you instead.</p><p></p><p>Ah! We old fogeys are really useless now."</p><p></p><p>"Senior Beitang, you're being too hard on yourselves."</p><p></p><p>"Let's not be so polite with each other. Since you don't want these spirit crystals, I'll take my leave now. </p><p></p><p>When I came, Senior Jing Di instructed me not to stay too long, to avoid exposing your identity."</p><p></p><p>Ye Xiao nodded.</p><p></p><p>Beitang Ce then left.</p><p></p><p>Helping Jing Di and the others was partly because of their selflessness and their deep care for him.</p><p></p><p>But he also had his own selfish motives.</p><p></p><p>Cultivating many powerful allies who would not betray him, and who could play an unexpected role at critical moments, was far better than cultivating strangers or ungrateful wolves.</p><p></p><p>Beitang Ce had just left when a figure appeared at the stairwell on the fourth floor, passing by him.</p><p></p><p>That figure paused at the stairwell, furrowing her brows in puzzlement:</p><p></p><p>"Strange, why do I feel like that person was Senior Beitang from the Central State? What is he doing in the Jianghai City? As the owner of the Ghostfire Spiritual Eyes, even with the Clan occupying the Jiuzhou, he should still be highly regarded in the Central State.</p><p></p><p>Is there someone in Jianghai City who knows him?"</p><p></p><p>After a moment, she shook her head and continued walking towards Ye Xiao.</p>

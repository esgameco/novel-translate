        <h1>Chapter 250</h1>
        <div class="content">
            <p>Here is the full English translation of the Chinese excerpt:</p><p></p><p>Regarding this result, Ye Xiao was already well aware of it in his heart.</p><p></p><p>Originally, when he was sent to study further, Ouyang Yunzhong had once said that he wanted to support him.</p><p></p><p>Because his cultivation had reached the sixth rank of the Innate Realm, just this alone could solve many troublesome matters.</p><p></p><p>There was another point, although he had only been in the library for a year, but for a library that often changes positions, his work experience was already not small.</p><p></p><p>Many people were like Gu Hai, coming in to mess around for a while and then leaving.</p><p></p><p>Of course, the ones she supported were not just him, but also some other supervisors.</p><p></p><p>In general, they were all her old subordinates.</p><p></p><p>Although Ye Xiao did not want to admit it, he knew that Ouyang Yunzhong definitely had some personal motives.</p><p></p><p>When she was the librarian before, she did not need to calculate so much.</p><p></p><p>But now, she was no longer the librarian, and she had to leave a way out for herself.</p><p></p><p>For example, in the future, if she wanted to arrange jobs for her relatives and family members, or do some other small things, she could use these connections.</p><p></p><p>The profits from the library were still very abundant.</p><p></p><p>Otherwise, why would she be idle and chatting nonsense? Helping him and others get promotions and raises?</p><p></p><p>At this point, Ye Xiao finally understood why in the past, when Librarian Ouyang transferred some employees in the library to other positions, it was so easy. And she could even find them some good positions.</p><p></p><p>This old librarian was really not simple.</p><p></p><p>Probably she had many "friends" outside as well.</p><p></p><p>But this was not a big deal, after all, it was not something that would harm the human race.</p><p></p><p>Moreover, for his current self, these things did not matter. He only needed to read books and become stronger, the other things were just experiences that came with the role he was playing.</p><p></p><p>Yang Qin was promoted to become the supervisor of the management area he used to be in.</p><p></p><p>This was also very understandable.</p><p></p><p>She was Ouyang Yunzhong's relative, and although there were many people in the library with better qualifications than her, her backdoor connections made it easier for her to squeeze in.</p><p></p><p>The colleagues who went to study with him had basically all been promoted.</p><p></p><p>Like Liu Chengxun, who was just idling here, he definitely would not have any position changes.</p><p></p><p>In general, it was just like this.</p><p></p><p>Later, the new librarian Jiang Chen led these management personnel to the upstairs conference room for a new meeting.</p><p></p><p>It was just some management issues.</p><p></p><p>After the meeting, Ye Xiao finally returned to the fourth floor.</p><p></p><p>Liu Chengxun, Pao Jiansheng, Yang Qin and others came to congratulate him one by one.</p><p></p><p>Ye Xiao responded to them one by one.</p><p></p><p>The four major joyous events in life are: getting married, the safety of mother and child in childbirth, and getting a promotion with a raise.</p><p></p><p>However, for Ye Xiao, these things did not have much appeal to him.</p><p></p><p>The only attraction might be the freedom to act as he pleased, without having to work.</p><p></p><p>This way, he could read more books and collect more imperial cultivation techniques to refine.</p><p></p><p>Today, Ye Xiao was not looking at cultivation techniques, but information related to improving the cultivation of spirit beasts.</p><p></p><p>The currently recognized methods for improving the cultivation of spirit beasts are a few.</p><p></p><p>The first is to eat other spirit beasts.</p><p>The second is to eat people.</p><p>The third is to eat heavenly materials and earthly treasures.</p><p>The fourth is to grow slowly.</p><p></p><p>Simple and crude.</p><p>Three eating, one growing.</p><p></p><p>First, exclude the second and fourth methods. These two methods are definitely not feasible.</p><p></p><p>The first and third are more stable.</p><p></p><p>But the first method is actually not that fast, because there are not that many higher-level spirit beasts to catch.</p><p></p><p>If there were, Ye Xiao would not have to find ways to raise their cultivation.</p><p></p><p>Those spirit beasts with relatively weak cultivation are like snacks, completely useless.</p><p></p><p>The only relatively fast one is the heavenly materials and earthly treasures.</p><p></p><p>But these things are basically in the deep mountains and forests, and not easy to find.</p><p></p><p>However, Ye Xiao still found some relatively obscure but good methods.</p><p></p><p>For example, constructing a special spirit beast gathering formation.</p><p></p><p>This is the most common method used by many beast tamers.</p><p></p><p>First, the formation can be used continuously for a long time with little wear and tear, so the consumption is naturally not much.</p><p></p><p>Secondly, it is really cheap.</p><p></p><p>The cost of cultivating a spirit beast is extremely expensive.</p><p></p><p>Not to mention cultivating a group, and a group of relatively high-end spirit beasts.</p><p></p><p>The spirit gathering formation will save a lot of expenses.</p><p></p><p>And it can be used in combination with other methods.</p><p></p><p>He does not necessarily have to use it as a standalone cultivation method, he can use it to assist other methods.</p><p></p><p>This is a very good choice.</p><p></p><p>Perfect!</p><p></p><p>There is another method, which is a secret elixir specially made for spirit beasts.</p><p></p><p>There are some elixirs that are used to increase the speed at which spirit beasts absorb spiritual energy.</p><p></p><p>Because they are different from normal human beings.</p><p></p><p>Spirit beasts have so-called rules and regulations, such as their meridians being fragile, and certain meridians cannot be casually activated.</p><p></p><p>For spirit beasts, their origin is only the spirit core, and the more spiritual energy they absorb, the faster their strength will increase.</p><p></p><p>Unless they reach a critical point, which may cause them to explode.</p><p></p><p>But this critical point is not so easy to reach.</p><p></p><p>Therefore, in a short period of time, Ye Xiao had determined three plans.</p><p></p><p>Use the spirit gathering formation as an auxiliary, and then through the secret elixir...</p><p></p><p>Here is the full English translation of the Chinese excerpt:</p><p></p><p>The medicinal pills can help increase their speed of absorbing spiritual energy.</p><p></p><p>Finally, using heavenly materials and earthly treasures, I can greatly enhance their strength.</p><p></p><p>In this way, I can easily obtain a large number of star beasts with stronger strength.</p><p></p><p>Although it's a bit of a hassle, it's far more convenient than directly capturing a few divine or semi-divine beasts.</p><p></p><p>But isn't it because I haven't encountered any star beasts above the semi-divine level?</p><p></p><p>After confirming these three plans, Ye Xiao went to look at the other books.</p><p></p><p>Implementing these three plans still has some minor troubles.</p><p></p><p>For example, he currently doesn't have a suitable spiritual gathering formation.</p><p></p><p>He only has two formations, one focused on illusion and killing, and the other on defense.</p><p></p><p>He'll have to wait until recently to find a better spiritual gathering formation.</p><p></p><p>As for the heavenly materials and earthly treasures, he can find them in the southwestern forest sea.</p><p></p><p>And for the medicinal pills, he can also choose to find the materials there and refine them himself.</p><p></p><p>It's cheaper, more convenient, less worrying, and less tiring.</p><p></p><p>If he can fully cultivate those few star beasts, and supplement his own vitality, he will definitely be able to break through to the Emperor Realm before the beast disaster arrives.</p><p></p><p>At that time, he will truly have the ability to face the beast disaster and the star battlefield.</p><p></p><p>Ye Xiao suddenly felt like he had become a top-notch livestock breeder.</p><p></p><p>"Postnatal care for star beasts. What are you reading this kind of book for?"</p><p></p><p>The speaker was Liu Chengxun.</p><p></p><p>He probably got bored staying in his own area, so he came to take a look.</p><p></p><p>Although he is not a full-floor manager like Ye Xiao, but due to his special identity, no one really manages him.</p><p></p><p>Ye Xiao closed the book.</p><p></p><p>"I've raised a cat-type star beast, so I want to learn some knowledge in advance."</p><p></p><p>"I see."</p><p></p><p>Liu Chengxun nodded, he knew that Ye Xiao had raised a cat-type star beast.</p><p></p><p>But he didn't find it particularly interesting.</p><p></p><p>It's just a cat, how strong could it be?</p><p></p><p>Probably just the strength of a post-celestial cultivator, not even reaching the pre-celestial level.</p><p></p><p>To someone like him, a pre-celestial eighth-grade cultivator, it's just an ant among ants.</p><p></p><p>So he didn't continue discussing this topic with Ye Xiao, but switched to another topic.</p><p></p><p>"The librarian who came this time is not very strong, I thought the Nine States Alliance would send a Saint-Emperor level expert. </p><p></p><p>But it turned out to be just a pre-celestial sixth-grade Grand Master.</p><p></p><p>Looking at this, it seems the Nine States Alliance doesn't plan to treat Jianghai City as a key city for cultivation."</p><p></p><p>Ye Xiao: "(...)"</p><p></p><p>He was a bit speechless.</p><p></p><p>The other party is a Monarch Realm expert, far stronger than him by countless levels.</p><p></p><p>However, apart from him, probably no one else in the entire library would know the true identity of Jiang Chen.</p><p></p><p>Liu Chengxun, a mere pre-celestial eighth-grade cultivator, couldn't perceive the other's cultivation. This is quite normal.</p><p></p><p>But Liu Chengxun's words did give him some inspiration.</p><p></p><p>The fact that the Nine States Alliance sent a Monarch Realm expert shows that they intend to seriously develop Jianghai City.</p><p></p><p>Ye Xiao had already noticed that this library expansion added many new cultivation techniques, several of which were at the Grand Master level.</p><p></p><p>Although it's still not as good as the martial arts library in the Central State, it's a huge improvement compared to before. This is quite beneficial for him, as he wants to study Grand Master level techniques to refine Emperor Realm techniques.</p><p></p><p>Additionally, the reason the Central State wants to heavily develop Jianghai City is likely to gather more population, turning it into a top-tier city, and then use it to protect more human tribes when the beast disaster arrives.</p><p></p><p>This is understandable, and Ye Xiao has no intention of letting the star beasts destroy Jianghai City. Protecting 8 million people or 80 million people doesn't make much difference to him.</p><p></p><p>However, he needs to be careful that this won't attract even stronger star beasts during the beast disaster.</p><p></p><p>He's not afraid of divine beasts, but if there are super-divine beast experts comparable to Emperor Realm cultivators, that would be troublesome.</p><p></p><p>He hopes to quickly raise his own strength to the Emperor Realm through cultivating these star beasts, to ensure complete safety.</p><p></p><p>The breeding farm must be developed, and the cultivation techniques need to be refined as soon as possible.</p><p></p><p>Meanwhile, two bald men and an older man also arrived at the entrance of the library, looking at the statue, the older man spoke thoughtfully:</p><p></p><p>"Young friend Fa Zheng, after being in Jianghai City for so long, haven't you seen the legendary Sword-Dagger Immortal?"</p><p></p><p>"Replying to Senior Li, the identity of the Sword-Dagger Immortal has always been a mystery in Jianghai City. Not only me, even experts like the Sword Saint of Hanzhou, Liu Chengxun, have never seen him in person. He even gave up returning to Hanzhou and became a librarian here just to try and meet the Senior Sword-Dagger Immortal."</p>

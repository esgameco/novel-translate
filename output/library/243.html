        <h1>Chapter 243</h1>
        <div class="content">
            <p>Here is the full English translation of the Chinese excerpt:</p><p></p><p>"There's still one more missing! Mingdie Shenzong hasn't shown up yet."</p><p></p><p>"Her? Whether she comes or not, it doesn't make much difference. After all, she's just a spiritual beast, and her strength is basically at the bottom of the entire Tianmo Cliff."</p><p></p><p>"The powerful Shenzong experts who have come here are the true essence of our Tianmo Cliff.</p><p></p><p>With them here, it's almost as if all the powerful experts of the Tianmo Cliff have emerged."</p><p></p><p>"That's true. After all, just a few of them would be more than enough for this human race, let alone the entire twenty of them!"</p><p></p><p>At this moment, in the minds of almost everyone, Ye Xiao had already been declared dead.</p><p></p><p>Now, he was just a vegetable that could still breathe.</p><p></p><p>The twenty Shenzong beasts were chatting with each other, like old friends who hadn't seen each other for a long time, completely ignoring the presence of Ye Xiao.</p><p></p><p>They didn't treat Ye Xiao as an intruder at all.</p><p></p><p>In their eyes, Ye Xiao was just a delicious piece of meat, just like the distant spectating beasts.</p><p></p><p>What they were discussing now was how to divide this piece of meat, not how to subdue it.</p><p></p><p>"Alright, let's not waste too much time. We're all old comrades from the Tianmo Cliff, there's no need to argue over a piece of meat.</p><p></p><p>This meat, we'll divide it equally among ourselves, consider it as a sacrificial offering, and no one is allowed to hog it for themselves."</p><p></p><p>As soon as these words were spoken, the other beasts' eyes lit up.</p><p></p><p>Their strength was definitely not as good as Bazu Jun and the others. If it came down to it, they were the least likely to be able to eat Ye Xiao.</p><p></p><p>But now that the powerful Bazu Jun had spoken, there was no problem.</p><p></p><p>"Senior Bazu Jun is so generous!"</p><p>"As expected of Senior Bazu Jun!"</p><p></p><p>The shouts of the beasts made Long Mo and Tongtian Giant Python quite unhappy, but they were helpless.</p><p></p><p>After all, Bazu Jun's strength was far superior to theirs.</p><p></p><p>Moreover, not only that, Bazu Jun had an excellent relationship with Leitong Qingniu, whose strength was also extremely powerful.</p><p></p><p>They couldn't defeat the two of them, otherwise they wouldn't have to swallow their anger here.</p><p></p><p>Leitong Qingniu slightly raised his thick, muscular arm.</p><p></p><p>"Alright, all of you be quiet."</p><p></p><p>The beasts immediately fell silent, not daring to speak.</p><p></p><p>Leitong Qingniu looked at Ye Xiao and spoke indifferently:</p><p></p><p>"Human, before I kill you, I have a question I want to ask. What are you doing here in the Tianmo Cliff? Don't tell me you came here specifically to die?"</p><p></p><p>The Tianmo Cliff was originally a forbidden area for the human race. Suddenly, a human had barged in, so Leitong Qingniu couldn't help but be curious and wanted to ask about the reason.</p><p></p><p>Ye Xiao had remained silent the entire time, just standing in place.</p><p></p><p>When he came to the Tianmo Cliff, his Taixuan Tiangong had already thoroughly scanned the entire mountain cliff.</p><p></p><p>He was already very familiar with the powerful beasts here.</p><p></p><p>So he was waiting.</p><p></p><p>Waiting for these beasts to come to him, and then he would slaughter them all, saving time and effort.</p><p></p><p>But now it seems that the last beast was most likely not going to show up.</p><p></p><p>Unexpectedly, there was such a steady beast.</p><p></p><p>It was quite interesting.</p><p></p><p>But it didn't matter. After he had eliminated these beasts, he would then deal with her.</p><p></p><p>Thinking about this, Ye Xiao slowly opened his eyes. Although he couldn't see anything at the bottom of the Tianmo Cliff, this did not hinder the expansion of his spiritual sense, allowing him to take in everything around him.</p><p></p><p>These beasts seemed to have evolved extremely strong vision, able to adapt to this environment after living in it for a long time.</p><p></p><p>But it didn't matter.</p><p></p><p>They were just a bunch of medicinal ingredients, why think so much about it?</p><p></p><p>With a slight movement of his gaze, Ye Xiao struck.</p><p></p><p>When he killed, he never liked too much unnecessary talk.</p><p></p><p>A sword beam suddenly appeared in the dark space, like a shining sun, directly slicing through the dark abyss and illuminating the entire Tianmo Cliff.</p><p></p><p>In an instant, countless beasts were startled by the dazzling light, their shrieks and roars intertwining.</p><p></p><p>Countless beasts began to flee and fly in chaos.</p><p></p><p>The collisions and stampedes were countless, and beasts kept falling from the sky like falling dumplings.</p><p></p><p>But as soon as these falling beasts approached the sword beam, they were shattered to pieces by the spiritual energy ripples on the sword beam.</p><p></p><p>All of this happened in the blink of an eye.</p><p></p><p>The Shenzong beasts had never expected Ye Xiao to suddenly strike.</p><p></p><p>This human had no rules at all.</p><p></p><p>He actually dared to come here to deal with them!</p><p></p><p>This was a huge joke! Who did he think he was?</p><p></p><p>What strength did he have to run wild here? Twenty Shenzong experts!</p><p></p><p>Altogether twenty super experts! More than enough to kill him hundreds of times over.</p><p></p><p>What gave him the right? How dare he?</p><p></p><p>However, just as the Shenzong beasts were about to be enraged, the sword beam had already descended.</p><p></p><p>Boom! The massive sword beam, in an instant, had split the two Xiantian Seventh-Grade Shenzong beasts in front of Ye Xiao into two halves.</p><p></p><p>He had restrained his strength, otherwise this one move would have reduced them to powder!</p><p></p><p>Here is the full English translation of the Chinese excerpt:</p><p></p><p>Because Ye Xiao came to find the star core and heavenly materials and treasures to refine dan, he was not here to cause trouble for no reason.</p><p></p><p>So he wanted to keep the opponent's corpse and star core!</p><p></p><p>One move to instantly kill two divine lord star beasts, the other star beasts were immediately filled with dread. So strong!</p><p></p><p>"Attack!"</p><p></p><p>Almost all the divine lord star beasts at this moment only had this single thought in their hearts.</p><p></p><p>Eighteen figures, some with huge beast forms, some with burly humanoid forms. </p><p></p><p>But regardless of their form, their aura was overwhelming, shaking the mountains and rivers with their powerful might.</p><p></p><p>The eighteen divine lord auras pressed down on Ye Xiao from above, a force that would have made any divine lord unable to even raise their arm to unleash their techniques.</p><p></p><p>Because this power was too strong, the surrounding sea of skeletons was pressed down into the ground, crushed like cotton, countless skeletons starting to shatter and crumble into powder.</p><p></p><p>They were forcefully pressed down hundreds of meters deep.</p><p></p><p>But Ye Xiao's body did not move at all.</p><p></p><p>The Taixuan Heavenly Gale was activated, the solidified spiritual force sweeping out from Ye Xiao as the center, directly blasting all eighteen divine lord star beasts away.</p><p></p><p>Among them, six at the early divine lord seventh rank had their meridians ruptured and bodies severely injured, losing their combat ability.</p><p></p><p>One move! Another move, subduing six divine lord star beasts.</p><p></p><p>The remaining twelve were simply stunned into silence by this sight!</p><p></p><p>But this was not the end, the good show was just beginning.</p><p></p><p>Ye Xiao activated the Divine Will Technique, instantly teleporting in front of the Dragon Demon.</p><p></p><p>Without giving the Dragon Demon time to react, the Great Nirvana Fist struck out.</p><p></p><p>"No—!"</p><p></p><p>Feeling that desperate aura and power, the Dragon Demon's entire wyrm body collapsed.</p><p></p><p>Punch after punch, like thunderclaps, instantly smashing its head to pieces, leaving only the headless wyrm body thrashing on the flattened skeleton powder, emitting thick bone ash.</p><p></p><p>The pain nerves in its flesh were still active.</p><p></p><p>The star beasts had not even finished being shocked when Ye Xiao appeared in front of the Eight-Legged Steed.</p><p></p><p>The Eight-Legged Steed was startled.</p><p></p><p>The Thunder Bison was swinging its thunder-infused iron fists, rushing towards Ye Xiao's head.</p><p></p><p>"Eight-Legged, quickly evade. Do not directly confront him."</p><p></p><p>The Thunder Bison's plan was good, to sneak attack and stop Ye Xiao's assault, while the Eight-Legged Steed's speed was very fast, so there was hope it could dodge.</p><p></p><p>Although he knew his punch would definitely not be able to injure Ye Xiao, at least he could resolve the crisis for the Eight-Legged Steed first, then deal with the rest.</p><p></p><p>But he never expected that he had miscalculated.</p><p></p><p>Ye Xiao did not dodge! He just stood there motionless, letting the thunder-infused fists strike him.</p><p></p><p>Boom—! A violent explosion, the shockwaves and air currents raging, sweeping through an area of tens of thousands of meters.</p><p></p><p>He was already at the early divine lord ninth rank!</p><p></p><p>He was already an extremely powerful star beast!</p><p></p><p>But he was now in despair.</p><p></p><p>Ye Xiao indeed did not dodge, but his body did not move at all.</p><p></p><p>His punch could not even injure a single hair on Ye Xiao.</p><p></p><p>It was a body refining technique! The opponent had a body refining technique! And the opponent's strength was truly powerful, powerful enough that he could not even break through the opponent's defense!</p><p></p><p>At the same time he struck, a blade light from Ye Xiao had already descended with unmatched momentum.</p><p></p><p>Instantly splitting the fleeing Eight-Legged Steed in half.</p><p></p><p>Instant kill!</p><p></p><p>The entire scene was dumbfounded, all the star beasts' jaws nearly dropped to the ground.</p><p></p><p>That was the Eight-Legged Steed! An existence that could rank among the top three in the entire Demon Cliff!</p><p></p><p>Yet today, it was instantly killed by the opponent.</p><p></p><p>The Thunder Bison finally understood why Ye Xiao had come here.</p><p></p><p>He was not insane, nor was he here to seek death.</p><p></p><p>He was simply here to play a game.</p><p></p><p>And they, the twenty divine lords of the Demon Cliff, were all his playthings!</p><p></p><p>So he had not said a single word the entire time.</p><p></p><p>Who would talk to their toys?</p><p></p><p>Puchi—! The next moment, a sharp pain came from his chest.</p><p></p><p>He knew that was the opponent's Great Nirvana Fist, already piercing through his chest.</p><p></p><p>He felt his heart shattered, his consciousness sinking into darkness, unable to hear the sounds around him.</p><p></p><p>As a star beast who had long lived at the bottom of the Demon Cliff, he was already accustomed to the silence.</p><p></p><p>But at this moment, he was filled with fear of this silence.</p><p></p><p>Because he knew it signified death.</p><p></p><p>The remaining nine divine lord star beasts were completely dazed.</p><p></p><p>What happened? It seemed from Ye Xiao's first strike to now, it had not even been ten seconds?</p><p></p><p>The rest of the chapter is omitted as it continues the story beyond the excerpt provided.</p>

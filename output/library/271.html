        <h1>Chapter 271</h1>
        <div class="content">
            <p>Here is the full English translation of the Chinese excerpt:</p><p></p><p>The White Dragon Vein was covered in ice and snow all year round, presenting a bleak, lifeless winter scene. However, hidden within that white forest was an endless wellspring of vitality.</p><p></p><p>The biting night wind suddenly parted to reveal two figures silently appearing.</p><p></p><p>Beitang Ce had a bewildered expression.</p><p></p><p>"We've arrived at the White Dragon Vein?"</p><p></p><p>Ye Xiao nodded.</p><p></p><p>"That fast?"</p><p></p><p>He felt like he had barely reacted before going from Jianghai City to the White Dragon Vein. But one must know that Jianghai City was in the Central State, while the White Dragon Vein was in the northeast of the Nine States. The distance between them was vast.</p><p></p><p>Yet Ye Xiao had come here in the blink of an eye. His speed was several times faster than anyone else's. Although Ye Xiao was a King Realm expert, Beitang Ce would bet his life that other King Realm cultivators would find it extremely difficult to match this speed.</p><p></p><p>As the saying goes, the martial dao knows no unbreakable, only the unbeatable. Ye Xiao's speed was so fast that his combat prowess could not be described by the standards of ordinary King Realm experts.</p><p></p><p>The moment the two appeared, many sensing presences in the darkness began converging on them.</p><p></p><p>Beitang Ce explained, "These people should all be reclusive cultivators training in the White Mountain Range. Among them are many Grand Masters and even Saint Realm experts. However, since they have been in hiding for so long, their records are not documented in the official archives of the Nine States.</p><p></p><p>But if the Nine States ever faces a crisis, they will not hesitate to come out and lend their aid. The White Dragon Vein is rich in spiritual energy, with many powerful experts hidden here."</p><p></p><p>Ye Xiao nodded. Previously, when he had descended the mountain to subdue the Ai'er King, Yang Zhengyi and his master and senior brothers were part of this group of reclusive experts.</p><p></p><p>As the saying goes, in times of peace, Taoists retreat to the mountains, but in times of chaos, they come down to save the people.</p><p></p><p>Retreating to the mountains is a sign of a tranquil heart, while coming down to help is a sign of a passionate spirit.</p><p></p><p>As the two approached the mountain, Beitang Ce explained, "The White Dragon Vein is a naturally formed dragon vein, so it has its own self-awareness. To protect itself, it has established a natural defensive barrier that is even stronger than an Imperial Formation. It cannot be successfully analyzed, and one can only truly enter the dragon vein and communicate with it by passing its test.</p><p></p><p>The test of the White Dragon Vein is the Heavenly Stairs, a stairway from the foot of the mountain to the Heavenly Pool at the summit. Along the stairs, the dragon qi released by the dragon vein grows stronger the higher one climbs. Each step represents a different level.</p><p></p><p>Some may never be able to reach the top of the stairs and gain the dragon vein's recognition in their lifetime. One cannot fly up the stairs, only descend. It is said that the fastest record for reaching the top is three days and three nights, and the cultivator who achieved that eventually broke through to the Emperor Realm.</p><p></p><p>So don't be too concerned if your ascent is slow. Haste will only lead to a scattered mind, and then everything will be in disarray."</p><p></p><p>Ye Xiao calmly asked, "How long did Qinglong take?"</p><p></p><p>"If I remember correctly, Qinglong took nine days and nine nights. This record, while not unparalleled in history, is still among the very top.</p><p></p><p>The current top three records on the Heavenly Stairs are three days and three nights, seven days and seven nights, and nine days and nine nights. Qinglong's achievement ranks him among the top three in history.</p><p></p><p>Of course, this is only within the White Dragon Vein. When the dragon veins of the Nine States were not yet all destroyed, there were many other geniuses from different dragon veins, and each vein has its own unique test.</p><p></p><p>So it doesn't mean Qinglong was definitively one of the top three in history, but it is undeniable that he was an exceptional talent!"</p><p></p><p>Ye Xiao nodded, and he and Beitang Ce arrived at the foot of the White Dragon Vein. Ye Xiao's consciousness sensed a spiritual energy barrier blocking their way. Behind the barrier was a grand gate, and beyond that was the Heavenly Stairs.</p><p></p><p>Beitang Ce explained further, "This spiritual energy barrier is also created by the dragon vein. Every challenger who wishes to enter the Heavenly Stairs must break through this barrier. If one cannot even open this barrier, then they have no qualifications to step into the Heavenly Stairs.</p><p></p><p>You need to carefully sense the martial dao realm that the dragon vein has placed within, comprehend it, and pass the dragon vein's test in order to open this spiritual energy barrier."</p><p></p><p>Ye Xiao raised an eyebrow slightly. He was not very good at this kind of test.</p><p></p><p>"Just breaking through this spiritual energy barrier is enough?"</p><p></p><p>Beitang Ce nodded.</p><p></p><p>"You're not thinking of trying to forcefully break through, are you? I advise you to save your strength, because that is basically impossible to succeed. Many challengers before you have tried that method, but in the end, it only made the barrier stronger. Some even got immediately rejected at this first hurdle and couldn't even set foot on the Heavenly Stairs."</p><p></p><p>Before Beitang Ce could finish speaking, suddenly...</p><p></p><p>Here is the full English translation of the Chinese excerpt:</p><p></p><p>Ye Xiao swung his domineering saber, and it had already been unleashed.</p><p></p><p>Boom! The saber beam radiated thousands of feet in the night sky, with the force of thunderous might, slamming heavily against the spiritual energy barrier.</p><p></p><p>Accompanied by an earth-shattering roar, countless living beings were awakened.</p><p></p><p>"Someone is attacking the Heaven's Gate barrier?"</p><p></p><p>"Who is so crazy? Attacking the Heaven's Gate barrier in the dead of night?"</p><p></p><p>"Doesn't he know? The Heaven's Gate barrier cannot be broken open by techniques? It will only grow stronger the more it is attacked!"</p><p></p><p>Beitang Ce was also greatly startled by Ye Xiao's sudden action.</p><p></p><p>"What are you doing? Didn't I tell you that you can't use brute force to unlock it?"</p><p></p><p>Ye Xiao did not answer him, because he had just noticed that the barrier had a faint trace of being broken by his attack.</p><p></p><p>Since his spiritual power was extremely strong, Beitang Ce could not sense it, but Ye Xiao could perceive it clearly.</p><p></p><p>Since there was a crack, it would be much easier to deal with.</p><p></p><p>Because just now, he had only used 50% of his strength.</p><p></p><p>The Domineering Saber was not an ordinary imperial art, it was the pinnacle of imperial saber techniques, with far greater amplification of attacks than ordinary imperial arts.</p><p></p><p>Moreover, even if the next strike could not break it, Ye Xiao still had the Slaughter God Art and the Great Dragon, and with these combined, Ye Xiao was confident that this barrier could not withstand for long.</p><p></p><p>Thinking this, he raised his hand again, and the surging spiritual energy in his body frantically condensed, radiating a hundred thousand feet of light from his hand, instantly illuminating the entire heaven and earth. Countless living beings and hidden cultivators in the mountains and wilderness emerged from their caves.</p><p></p><p>"Wow, whose technique is this? It's too powerful!"</p><p></p><p>"Does this guy want to try a second time after the first one didn't work?"</p><p></p><p>"This time is much stronger than before! Can he really break this barrier?"</p><p></p><p>"Are you kidding? Do you think the Heaven's Gate barrier was established by just anyone? It was personally built by the Dragon Vein. Except for the Dragon Vein, no one else can shatter it!"</p><p></p><p>Next to Ye Xiao, Beitang Ce also kept persuading him.</p><p></p><p>"Ye Xiao, I know your strength and talent are monstrous. But right now, you are still only a King Realm expert. You don't have the ability to break this spiritual energy barrier yet.</p><p></p><p>Throughout history, those who came to the Heaven's Gate were all King Realm experts. They, like you, were unable to shatter the barrier with their techniques. They could only open it by comprehending the Dao of martial arts within."</p><p></p><p>But the moment he finished speaking, Ye Xiao's saber had already descended.</p><p></p><p>The saber beam fell, and the world instantly darkened. The next moment, the light burst forth, followed by a thunderous explosion.</p><p></p><p>Boom! This explosion was several times stronger than the previous one.</p><p></p><p>The terrifying shockwave even pushed the snow layer covering the ground up to the thighs outward, like towering waves.</p><p></p><p>On the flat ground, it was as if a snow avalanche had occurred! At the same time, the spiritual energy barrier forged by the Dragon Vein's Heaven's Gate began to emit a crisp cracking sound, and then shattered with a thunderous roar.</p><p></p><p>Beitang Ce was dumbfounded.</p><p></p><p>It opened? Ye Xiao had actually blasted open the barrier? Was this for real? Throughout the history of the Nine Provinces, the experts who came to the White Dragon Vein were only able to open the spiritual energy barrier by breaking through. But Ye Xiao had single-handedly blasted it open! This was the first record in the history of the White Dragon Vein.</p><p></p><p>Countless cultivators who sensed the situation here were excitedly trembling.</p><p></p><p>"What a powerful attack! The entire earth started to tremble from that last one."</p><p></p><p>"Can you feel it? It's spiritual energy! The thick spiritual energy is leaking out because the energy barrier has been broken."</p><p></p><p>"My god, who is this guy? He's too crazy, actually managing to blast open the Heaven's Gate barrier."</p><p></p><p>"Damn, this is the first time in the entire history of the White Dragon Vein."</p><p></p><p>"A madman, truly a madman. Judging from his performance, he has a high chance of stepping onto the Heavenly Ladder. It's just a matter of how long it will take him to ascend the Heavenly Ladder."</p><p></p><p>"Let's go take a look!"</p><p></p><p>Countless hidden cultivators in the mountains and wilderness quickly rushed towards the scene.</p><p></p><p>Ye Xiao's mouth curled up in a slight smile.</p><p></p><p>"They came even faster than I expected! I should be able to enter this Heavenly Ladder now, right?"</p><p></p><p>Beitang Ce gulped and wiped the cold sweat from his forehead.</p><p></p><p>"Yes, of course.</p><p></p><p>This Heavenly Ladder's Heaven's Gate was set up after the other Dragon Veins were severed. It has always been guarded by the Four Sages of the Nine Provinces.</p><p></p><p>It requires the possession of two seals to open it. You already have the Xuanwu Seal, and once you obtain the seal of the sage guarding this place, you can enter the Heaven's Gate."</p><p></p><p>(PS: In chapter 265, I wrote incorrectly that the Xingxing Tiger and Blood Wing were both Deity Realm, I'm very sorry about that. Sometimes I write too fast and my brain slips up. Just remember that.)</p><p></p><p>One update, three thousand words.</p><p></p><p>Please subscribe, vote, and recommend.</p><p></p><p>Thank you to the readers Sea Without Four Seasons, A Life Without Regret, A Sword Frost Congealing the Nine Provinces, and Summer Scorching for your donations, I'm deeply grateful.</p><p></p><p>(This chapter is complete)</p>

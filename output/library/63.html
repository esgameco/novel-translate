        <h1>Chapter 63</h1>
        <div class="content">
            <p>Here is the full English translation of the Chinese excerpt:</p><p></p><p>After leaving, Huan Liuli couldn't help but ask, "Master, when did your healing arts become so powerful?"</p><p></p><p>Ye Xiao had learned healing arts, and she had previously known a little bit about it.</p><p></p><p>But healing arts are not something that can be learned well just because one's cultivation is high. Even for a doctor, killing is far simpler than saving lives.</p><p></p><p>Ye Xiao's combat prowess was extraordinary, Huan Liuli acknowledged that. But when did Ye Xiao's healing abilities also become so strong?</p><p></p><p>"There are many things you don't know. Do I have to tell you everything?" Ye Xiao replied.</p><p></p><p>"Oh."</p><p></p><p>Huan Liuli didn't continue to speak, but she felt a sense of seriousness in her heart.</p><p></p><p>Her master was becoming more and more mysterious.</p><p></p><p>Not only did he have extraordinary attack power, but he also possessed such powerful healing abilities. With the combination of attack and healing, he would be extremely difficult to defeat. Huan Liuli had originally set a small goal to lurk by his side for two hundred years, surpass his cultivation, and gain her freedom. But now, it seemed that this time frame might need to be increased.</p><p></p><p>She decided, I'll be his servant for two hundred and fifty years!</p><p></p><p>The scene of the accident was quickly handled. The injured had been healed, but for safety reasons, they would still undergo a thorough examination to prevent any hidden injuries.</p><p></p><p>As for the old soldier who had been examined, he caused quite a stir.</p><p></p><p>Soon, Mr. Zhao came to the City Lord's Mansion with several reports in hand, in front of the City Lord Dou Tianyü.</p><p></p><p>"Mr. Zhao, what brings you here?" Dou Tianyü put down the documents in his hand and stood up to welcome him.</p><p></p><p>Mr. Zhao placed the reports in front of Dou Tianyü.</p><p></p><p>"City Lord, take a look at this."</p><p></p><p>Dou Tianyü adjusted his glasses and picked up the reports, suddenly unable to suppress the shock on his face.</p><p></p><p>"How is this possible? An eighty-year-old martial artist showing signs of rejuvenation?"</p><p></p><p>"Not only that, he is also an old soldier who was wounded on the battlefield. His meridians were completely withered, much more severe than the average martial artist."</p><p></p><p>"My goodness, who did this?" Dou Tianyü asked in disbelief.</p><p></p><p>"I investigated, but there were no results. The surveillance scans couldn't detect the other party, who should be a master above the Sect Master realm and has already disrupted the magnetic field.</p><p></p><p>Even more terrifying is that he also deleted the old soldier's memories, and to some extent, also tampered with the memories of the others.</p><p></p><p>So much so that when I arranged for people to search with spiritual power, they couldn't find any clues."</p><p></p><p>"This is too terrifying, isn't he not only a healer, but also a powerful spiritual cultivator?"</p><p></p><p>"I can't say for sure. It's possible that he has another powerful spiritual cultivator accompanying him."</p><p></p><p>Dou Tianyü was completely stunned. He never expected that in his small Jianghai City, there would suddenly appear two more powerful experts! This was like winning the lottery.</p><p></p><p>These days, were powerful experts as common as cabbage?</p><p></p><p>"City Lord, these few people must be found. Especially this healer, he is too important! As you know, a good healer is of immense value. Healers are divided into low, middle, high, and peak levels. The other party's level is at least in the high-level healer category, or even stronger!</p><p></p><p>Moreover, healers are already rare. The value of a high-level healer is equivalent to a peak Sect Master of the third realm, or even a great Sect Master of the fourth realm! Not to mention, the other party may exceed the level of a high-level healer."</p><p></p><p>Dou Tianyü nodded.</p><p></p><p>"You're right, but how do we find this powerful expert?"</p><p></p><p>Here is the full English translation of the Chinese excerpt:</p><p></p><p>"Recklessly searching for them won't work. People of their caliber are not easily tempted by personal interests. However, if we use the opposite approach and force them out, that could be an option as well."</p><p></p><p>"What do you mean, Mr. Zhao?"</p><p></p><p>"We should find people to impersonate them and tarnish their reputations. First, we should target the swordsman and the knife expert. I'm confident that we can force them out. They are all extraordinary individuals, so they must be connected. Once we flush out the swordsman and the knife expert, the healers and the psychic experts will also have to show up."</p><p></p><p>"You're out of your mind!"</p><p></p><p>Dou Tianyü flatly refused.</p><p></p><p>"This is absolutely unacceptable. They have done great deeds for Jianghai City, often coming to our aid. How can I stoop to such despicable acts? Moreover, they are peerless experts. If we provoke them, it could be a disaster for Jianghai City."</p><p></p><p>"No, you're overthinking this."</p><p></p><p>Mr. Zhao chuckled.</p><p></p><p>"From the times he has come to Jianghai City's aid in times of crisis, we can see that he is not a bad person. As long as he is not a bad person, the danger won't be too great.</p><p></p><p>We can just shift the blame to the people below, saying they misunderstood the instructions.</p><p></p><p>If we can find these few individuals, it would be a tremendous accomplishment for both of us. Don't you want to advance your position further? Don't you want to raise your status?"</p><p></p><p>"It seems you've done this kind of thing before! Dou Tianyü has certainly gained a new perspective today. Unfortunately, I'm not as shameless as you."</p><p></p><p>Dou Tianyü sneered.</p><p></p><p>Mr. Zhao coldly retorted, "Dou Tianyü, don't act all high and mighty. I'm telling you, the higher-ups already want you to find these experts. Have you made any progress? This is your task, and if you can't complete it, not only will you not get a promotion and a raise, but you might even lose your current position."</p><p></p><p>"Mr. Zhao, you—!"</p><p></p><p>"What about me? Shall I report to the Central Province that you're not doing your job and haven't achieved any results? Although I'm not the higher-ups, I still have the right to bring this issue to their attention."</p><p></p><p>Dou Tianyü immediately backed down.</p><p></p><p>Seeing that he no longer objected, Mr. Zhao smiled slightly.</p><p></p><p>"That's more like it. Once we find them, it'll be good for you, good for me, and good for everyone.</p><p></p><p>Furthermore, I'm not asking to kill them. I want to help them get promoted and become wealthy and prosperous!</p><p></p><p>They are from the Nine Provinces, so they must have utilized the resources of the Nine Provinces to become so powerful. Shouldn't they contribute something to the Nine Provinces? Whose fault is it that they're hiding and not coming out? I'm left with no choice but to force them out."</p><p></p><p>On Ye Xiao's side, he was trying to clear his mind and was studying alchemy techniques when Ning Yuhen suddenly came running over.</p><p></p><p>"Manager, manager, you have to look at the forum in Jianghai City. It's exploded."</p><p></p><p>"What happened?"</p><p></p><p>"The identities of our city's experts have been exposed."</p><p></p><p>Ye Xiao's heart suddenly skipped a beat.</p><p></p><p>He was exposed? </p><p></p><p>How did it happen? In the past few days, he hadn't drawn too much attention, so it shouldn't have led to this, right? This morning when he used the Taixuan Tiangong to treat the injured and erase any memories of his appearance, and his spiritual power couldn't have been detected either!</p>

        <h1>Chapter 82</h1>
        <div class="content">
            <p>Here is the full English translation of the Chinese excerpt:</p><p></p><p>Ye Xiao nodded and agreed to the matter.</p><p></p><p>He originally did not want to agree, but after careful consideration, he had been reading books all the time, which was not good for his eyesight. Sometimes, he should also go out to relax.</p><p></p><p>Moreover, couldn't he read books outside? </p><p></p><p>As long as Ning Yuheng helped him move the books related to body cultivation to the car every day, he could read them in his spare time. This would not affect his relaxation or reading.</p><p></p><p>The director and Master Fajing exchanged a few pleasantries, and then Master Fajing and Ye Xiao walked out.</p><p></p><p>The city government had provided an Audi A6.</p><p></p><p>Ye Xiao couldn't actually drive, but it didn't matter, as he could easily acquire driving skills by scanning the minds of his colleagues who could drive, using his Taixuan Tiangong abilities.</p><p></p><p>He then called Huan Liuli to get in the car with him.</p><p></p><p>"Master Fajing, do you mind if I bring my spirit pet?"</p><p></p><p>Master Fajing shook his head slightly.</p><p></p><p>"No problem."</p><p></p><p>"Thank you."</p><p></p><p>Fajing didn't say much, but he couldn't help raising his eyebrows slightly as he looked at the Huan Liuli on Ye Xiao's shoulder.</p><p></p><p>He had a strange feeling that this cat was not an ordinary cat.</p><p></p><p>In fact, although he had reached the Grandmaster realm and could conceal his aura, when encountering someone of a higher level, there would still be a slight sense of something unusual, as the principle of level suppression was eternal and unchanging.</p><p></p><p>If Ye Xiao hadn't been by his side, he might have detected a slight clue. But with Ye Xiao there, he couldn't discern anything special about Huan Liuli.</p><p></p><p>This was because he could only tell that Ye Xiao was a post-Heaven Second-Grade martial artist, and a spirit pet that could be tamed by such a martial artist would definitely not be a top-tier spirit pet.</p><p></p><p>So after a slight raise of his eyebrows, Fajing no longer paid attention to it.</p><p></p><p>"Where are we going?"</p><p></p><p>"Just drive around, I'll let you know when it's time to stop."</p><p></p><p>Ye Xiao didn't say anything more, started the car, and began driving around the streets of Jianghai City.</p><p></p><p>Fajing in the backseat took out a golden Buddha statue, removed the red cloth covering it, and reverently placed it on the storage compartment in the front.</p><p></p><p>The golden Buddha sat there firmly, like a divine anchor, unmoving.</p><p></p><p>Fajing then leaned against the car door, watching the cultural architecture of Jianghai City with interest.</p><p></p><p>The man, the cat, and the monk sat quietly in the car for a long time.</p><p></p><p>Until the tank was almost empty and they stopped at a gas station to refuel, Fajing finally spoke:</p><p></p><p>"We've been driving for a while, must be hungry. Let's go eat something."</p><p></p><p>Ye Xiao nodded, as that was exactly what he had in mind.</p><p></p><p>After refueling, he took Fajing to a high-end private kitchen he had long wanted to try, and immediately ordered several main dishes.</p><p></p><p>Sweet and sour pork ribs, red-braised small yellow croaker, smoked beef, and Peking roast duck...</p><p></p><p>After placing the order, he suddenly spoke up:</p><p></p><p>"Oh, Master, as a Buddhist monk, you cannot eat meat."</p><p></p><p>Fajing smiled and didn't expose him.</p><p></p><p>"It's fine, the Shaolin Temple doesn't have much taboo about this."</p><p></p><p>"Then I'll just order these."</p><p></p><p>Fajing nodded, then took a seat by the window.</p><p></p><p>Ye Xiao swiped his card and joined him.</p><p></p><p>Fajing looked out the window and couldn't help sighing.</p><p></p><p>"The changes in Jianghai City are really big. I still remember, more than 60 years ago when I left Jianghai City to study at the Shaolin Temple, the buildings in Jianghai City were far less prosperous than they are now."</p><p></p><p>"Master, are you a native of Jianghai City?"</p><p></p><p>"That's right, I'm a native of Jianghai City.</p><p></p><p>Back then, I studied at the martial arts academy in the junior high section of Jianghai City. I was good at fist techniques and won some youth special awards in the Nine States, so I was noticed by the Shaolin Martial Arts Academy and became a special recruit.</p><p></p><p>At the time, I just wanted to be an ordinary disciple, but I became immersed in the Buddhist Dharma and couldn't extricate myself, so I shaved my head and became a direct disciple of the Shaolin Martial Arts Academy."</p><p></p><p>Here is the full English translation of the Chinese excerpt:</p><p></p><p>"Unfortunately, this poor monk is dull-witted. After sixty years of arduous cultivation, I've only managed to advance from the fifth rank of the Innate realm to the second rank of the Grand Master realm. This lifetime may be as far as I can go," he sighed.</p><p></p><p>Ye Xiao had read that the Shaolin Temple had both ordinary disciples and direct-line disciples. Ordinary disciples were no different from regular students at other martial arts academies - after graduation, they would either find jobs or join the military. But direct-line disciples could access the temple's advanced cultivation methods and had greater prospects for progress. However, once a disciple became direct-line, they were bound to the Shaolin Temple for life.</p><p></p><p>"Master need not be so self-deprecating. There are some who, even after sixty years of cultivation, may still be unable to break through the Innate realm," Fa Zheng said, nodding.</p><p></p><p>"That's true. Even the most outstanding geniuses in the world would need two or three decades to advance from the fifth rank of the Innate realm to the fifth rank of the Transcendent realm. I should be content. After all, it's impossible for one to achieve such remarkable progress in just a single year - that would be superhuman."</p><p></p><p>Ye Xiao remained silent.</p><p></p><p>Soon, the dishes began to arrive, and Ye Xiao eagerly started enjoying the delicious food. To his surprise, Fa Zheng did not touch the meat dishes, eating only plain white rice.</p><p></p><p>"Master, you said earlier that the Shaolin Temple does not prohibit eating meat?"</p><p></p><p>Fa Zheng nodded. "The Buddhist teachings do not forbid it, but I have set this rule for myself."</p><p></p><p>Ye Xiao glanced at the dishes on the table, wondering if he should eat them all himself. Although he could certainly finish them, it might be a bit excessive.</p><p></p><p>Fa Zheng seemed to sense Ye Xiao's thoughts and smiled slightly. "Ye Benefactor need not stand on ceremony. My personal rules are for myself alone. Just because I don't eat meat doesn't mean you can't."</p><p></p><p>Hearing this, Ye Xiao no longer held back and quickly cleared the table of the delicious food. After all, the city was footing the bill, so he might as well enjoy it.</p><p></p><p>Fa Zheng finished his rice and had a sip of cold tea, having completed his vegetarian meal. In truth, neither he nor Ye Xiao actually needed to eat, as beings of their level could survive on spiritual energy alone. But Fa Zheng had taken a small bite to be polite, knowing that Ye Xiao enjoyed food.</p><p></p><p>After the meal, they returned to the car and resumed their leisurely drive through the city. But suddenly, the golden Buddha statue began to glow.</p><p></p><p>"Stop the car," Fa Zheng said abruptly. Ye Xiao immediately braked and pulled over. Fa Zheng then quickly got out of the car and hurried into a nearby residential building.</p><p></p><p>Ye Xiao used his Profound Heavenly Might to scan the area and discovered that a Transcendent Realm star beast was hiding inside. Now he understood - the city lord had not only invited Fa Zheng to give a lecture to the graduating students, but also to sweep the city clean of any lurking star beasts and beastmen, to prevent them from causing trouble during the upcoming Seven Stars Convergence.</p><p></p><p>The golden Buddha must have a search function - unlike Ye Xiao's Illusory Jade, which did not glow, it would light up when it detected independent star beasts or beastmen.</p>

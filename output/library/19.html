        <h1>Chapter 19</h1>
        <div class="content">
            <p>Here is the full English translation of the Chinese excerpt:</p><p></p><p>"Dead humans, stinky humans! You actually dared to ride on top of Auntie's head! If Auntie's strength wasn't lacking, I would have swallowed you whole long ago! How dare you be so arrogant?"</p><p></p><p>Ye Xiao's voice came from the living room.</p><p></p><p>"What are you muttering about?"</p><p></p><p>Huan Liuli's expression changed, and she immediately said:</p><p></p><p>"Ah, nothing! I'm just washing some fruit."</p><p></p><p>After not hearing any more sounds from the living room, she patted her chest and let out a sigh of relief.</p><p></p><p>But soon, when her gaze fell on the fruit, a mischievous smile appeared on her face.</p><p></p><p>Afterwards, she took out a bunch of grapes, peeling them one by one. First, she licked them with her own tongue, then she took off her little shoes and rubbed them on her silk-stockinged little feet.</p><p></p><p>"Hehe, let's see how you dare bully Auntie, I'll make you pay for it!"</p><p></p><p>However, when she carried the fruit plate out of the kitchen with a smile, she directly met Ye Xiao's piercing gaze.</p><p></p><p>"If you don't finish eating all these grapes today, I'll peel off your skin and make a scarf."</p><p></p><p>Huan Liuli: "..."</p><p></p><p>That night, Ye Xiao was staying in the rented house.</p><p></p><p>This place had been cleaned very neatly by Huan Liuli, and there were also some fresh fruits, cooked dishes, beverages, and daily necessities, so it was quite comfortable.</p><p></p><p>However, the next morning, Huan Liuli was grabbed by the back of her neck by Ye Xiao and led towards the library.</p><p></p><p>Today was Monday, time to go to work.</p><p></p><p>"Why do I still have to sleep in, why don't I have to go to work, this is abuse, I protest! I want to protest!"</p><p></p><p>Ye Xiao couldn't be bothered to respond to her. Although this creature had established a connection with him, she was still an untamed star beast, and moreover, a Grandmaster-level one!</p><p></p><p>Her combat power was too high, and she hadn't learned human culture, so she was difficult to control.</p><p></p><p>If she acted recklessly, and certain big shots took notice of her, and then traced it back to him, it would be a big trouble.</p><p></p><p>So Ye Xiao had to take her to the library and keep an eye on her at all times.</p><p></p><p>A Grandmaster-level star beast can manifest a human form, and can also revert to its original form. When she came out, Ye Xiao would have her transform back into a phantom cat, with a coat color similar to a blue cat, a small and super cute one.</p><p></p><p>Ye Xiao bought a breakfast set from the takeout store outside the library, including a soy milk, a tray of steamed buns, and a tea leaf egg.</p><p></p><p>But when he arrived at the library, he was surprised to find Huan Liuli holding a large beef bun, eating it with relish.</p><p></p><p>This made Ye Xiao quite puzzled.</p><p></p><p>"Where did you get this large beef bun from?"</p><p></p><p>Huan Liuli lazily glanced at him and then said:</p><p></p><p>"Just now when you were buying breakfast at the store, I used an illusion to confuse them and took it."</p><p></p><p>Ye Xiao couldn't help but raise his eyebrows.</p><p></p><p>"You stole something again?"</p><p></p><p>The things in the house seemed to have all been stolen by Huan Liuli.</p><p></p><p>"Steal? What is stealing?"</p><p></p><p>As a star beast, Huan Liuli had no concept of rules.</p><p></p><p>"Stealing is taking someone else's things without their permission, it's stealing! Don't do this kind of thing again in the future."</p><p></p><p>"Ha! Why is it so troublesome? We star beasts have always followed the principle of 'might makes right', whoever has the ability to take things, they belong to that person."</p><p></p><p>"You are no longer a star beast, you are my star pet. If you dare to steal things randomly again next time, don't blame me for not being lenient."</p><p></p><p>Ye Xiao was quite concerned about this basic moral bottom line.</p><p></p><p>If it was stealing from bad people or enemies, he wouldn't be so righteous, but stealing from ordinary civilians was really too much.</p><p></p><p>After all, everyone's money is hard-earned.</p><p></p><p>Here is the full English translation of the Chinese excerpt:</p><p></p><p>"Alright, alright, I know now. Humans are really troublesome!" </p><p></p><p>Huan Liuli muttered unhappily, continuing to leisurely munch on her large beef bun.</p><p></p><p>Ye Xiao shook his head slightly. Judging from this, he knew that Huan Liuli would not easily obey. It seems he will have to pay more attention to her in the future.</p><p></p><p>There was no meeting today, so after finishing breakfast, Ye Xiao started reading a book.</p><p></p><p>This time he was reading a spiritual cultivation technique.</p><p></p><p>Beast Tamers need to cultivate two types of techniques.</p><p></p><p>The main one is to cultivate spiritual techniques, in order to enhance their own spiritual power. This way, when controlling the Star Beasts, they can avoid being controlled by the Star Beasts.</p><p></p><p>The other is the method of raising and enhancing the strength of the Star Beasts.</p><p></p><p>Ye Xiao will not become a Beast Tamer, he will only raise one or two, like the powerful Star Pet Huan Liuli.</p><p></p><p>So he needs to enhance his own spiritual power, to prevent being resisted by the Star Beasts.</p><p></p><p>Because, pure martial arts cultivation can only indirectly increase spiritual power a little bit.</p><p></p><p>A grand martial arts master is definitely not as strong in spiritual power as a spiritual power master! He still needs to specifically cultivate a spiritual technique.</p><p></p><p>In the half-day morning, Ye Xiao read four hundred spiritual techniques, and selected two source techniques, inputting them into his divine soul, allowing the Golden Book to start cultivating them by itself.</p><p></p><p>Accompanying the increase in spiritual power, Ye Xiao suddenly gained a special sense.</p><p></p><p>That is, he had a more precise perception ability than just sensing spiritual energy.</p><p></p><p>After reaching the Grandmaster realm, one can use spiritual energy projection to sense everything around oneself.</p><p></p><p>But this kind of perception can only sense the general outline.</p><p></p><p>While spiritual power perception can sense every single hair on the other person, even the slightest change in their expression.</p><p></p><p>This is about the difference between a black and white TV and a color TV!</p><p></p><p>After lunch, the first spiritual source technique he inputted had already been completely cultivated to perfection by the Golden Book, so Ye Xiao's spiritual power and control over it had increased significantly.</p><p></p><p>For example, he can use spiritual power to bend the iron spoon he's eating with.</p><p></p><p>Achieving this is extremely difficult.</p><p></p><p>Martial artists control spiritual energy because it has substance, just like air.</p><p></p><p>But spiritual power is formless, existing like electromagnetic waves.</p><p></p><p>Being able to transform spiritual power into substance requires far more spiritual power than a little bit.</p><p></p><p>"Spiritual power and spiritual energy are two completely different forces.</p><p></p><p>Spiritual power attacks can only be defended against by spiritual power or electromagnetic waves, while spiritual energy attacks cannot be defended against by spiritual power.</p><p></p><p>Now that I'm cultivating both different types of forces, I should have a greater chance of victory in future battles.</p><p></p><p>Against opponents at the same level, I will definitely have an absolute advantage. Even in battles against higher realms, I may not necessarily lose.</p><p></p><p>I just don't know how powerful my spiritual power has become now?"</p><p></p><p>With no one around, Ye Xiao focused his gaze on a three-meter-tall boulder by the side of the road.</p><p></p><p>Activating his spiritual power, with lightning and thunder, that huge boulder directly cracked and shattered into green bean-sized gravel!</p><p></p><p>"So powerful!"</p><p></p><p>Ye Xiao couldn't help but be slightly amazed.</p><p></p><p>The first basic spiritual technique cultivated by the Golden Book had already reached this level of attack power, which really exceeded his expectations.</p>

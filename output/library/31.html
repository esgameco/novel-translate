        <h1>Chapter 31</h1>
        <div class="content">
            <p>Here is the full English translation of the excerpt from the Chinese novel:</p><p></p><p>Qin Yuyan gently patted Huan Liuli's little head, and it was then that Ye Xiao noticed that there was a small pool in the courtyard of the Qin family.</p><p></p><p>It was stocked with many purple-scaled fish.</p><p></p><p>Ye Xiao had read about purple-scaled fish in the Records of Extraordinary Beasts. Purple-scaled fish have a wolf-level bloodline, grow and reproduce quickly, and adult purple-scaled fish are usually at the quasi-saint level of spirit beasts. They excel at group attacks, with sharp and powerful teeth that can easily tear apart the bones of a spirit beast of the same level! However, although purple-scaled fish are fierce, they also have a special ability - they can gather spiritual energy. </p><p></p><p>Moreover, purple-scaled fish taste delicious and are highly nourishing.</p><p></p><p>Therefore, many cultivator families with the means will raise some purple-scaled fish at home.</p><p></p><p>Huan Liuli was drooling with desire, squirming restlessly in Qin Yuyan's embrace.</p><p></p><p>Qin Yuyan smiled and said, "No, you can't. Many of the purple-scaled fish in there are already adults, and they are quasi-saint level spirit beasts. If you go over there, you won't be able to eat them, and they might even eat you."</p><p></p><p>Ye Xiao immediately used his spiritual power to suppress Huan Liuli.</p><p></p><p>"Hold it in. Didn't I give you so much to eat at the dining table just now?"</p><p></p><p>Huan Liuli responded with her own spiritual power.</p><p></p><p>"How can what you gave me compare to this? These are purple-scaled fish, a completely different level of taste and nourishment."</p><p></p><p>"Do you dare to try eating one? Do you believe I won't skin you and make a dragon-tiger fight dish? Wouldn't a Saint-Emperor spirit beast be even more nourishing than purple-scaled fish?"</p><p></p><p>Huan Liuli: "..."</p><p></p><p>Although she was unwilling, she could only retreat and shrink back into Qin Yuyan's embrace.</p><p></p><p>There was nothing she could do - when under someone else's roof, one must bow one's head.</p><p></p><p>After all, Ye Xiao was stronger than her. However, her beautiful big eyes were already starting to dart around, as if she was plotting something.</p><p></p><p>Qin Yuyan thought her persuasion had worked and happily stroked Huan Liuli's little head.</p><p></p><p>"Such a sensible little kitty. How about I take care of you for a few days?"</p><p></p><p>Huan Liuli's eyes shone brightly, and she immediately snuggled firmly against Qin Yuyan's chest.</p><p></p><p>"Meow~!"</p><p></p><p>"Hehe, Ye Xiao, did you see that? Your kitty really likes me."</p><p></p><p>Ye Xiao sighed softly. She doesn't like you, she likes your fish.</p><p></p><p>The two of them then went inside and headed to the third-floor study.</p><p></p><p>"This is my grandfather's collection of books. You should be able to find the cultivation techniques you need here. You start reading, and I'll go change my clothes."</p><p></p><p>Ye Xiao nodded, overjoyed, and immediately began studying the books in Qin Shenglong's collection.</p><p></p><p>To his surprise, most of them were ancient texts.</p><p></p><p>Although the room was small, not as grand as a library, most of the books were focused on the evolution of fundamental cultivation techniques, unlike the copied texts found in libraries.</p><p></p><p>In fact, this room even had a complete collection of seven different sword technique evolutions.</p><p></p><p>In other words, Ye Xiao only needed to read the books in this small room to almost complete the foundation for the Heavenly Slash sword technique.</p><p></p><p>Unfortunately, Ye Xiao had already completed the Heavenly Slash, so most of these sword techniques were useless to him.</p><p></p><p>However, Ye Xiao still learned a fundamental fist technique and a fundamental body cultivation method that he did not have before.</p><p></p><p>Since spiritual energy can strengthen cultivation techniques, the power of fist techniques is not weaker than swords and knives. With the addition of this new one, Ye Xiao now had seven fundamental fist techniques, but they still could not be combined.</p><p></p><p>It seemed he needed to learn a few more fist techniques.</p><p></p><p>As for the body cultivation method, with today's addition, Ye Xiao had now learned three of them.</p><p></p><p>Here is the full English translation of the Chinese excerpt:</p><p></p><p>The Door.</p><p></p><p>This is a technique that can be both offensive and defensive, relatively conservative, using spiritual energy to refine the body and bring it to the realm of being impervious to blades and spears.</p><p></p><p>Even so, this trip has earned him quite a bit.</p><p></p><p>Two basic techniques, one martial art, and one body refining method - it was not in vain to come here and read books. <div class="contentadv"><script>loadAdv(7,3);</script></div>As Ye Xiao was about to put back the body refining method, he took out the next book, his expression suddenly brightening.</p><p></p><p>Because the divine spiritual book in his mind had pulsed slightly.</p><p></p><p>This meant that there was a technique that could be synthesized.</p><p></p><p>And currently, the only technique in the divine book that needed to be synthesized was a spiritual technique.</p><p></p><p>Ye Xiao immediately opened the book, and sure enough, it was a spiritual technique of transmitting thoughts over vast distances, allowing one to project spiritual power and release it to extremely remote places.</p><p></p><p>It was akin to adding long-range shooting, turning a bomb into a missile.</p><p></p><p>This was a technique that Ye Xiao's current spiritual techniques lacked! Quickly, Ye Xiao imprinted this technique onto the divine book.</p><p></p><p>After obtaining the divine book, he immediately began to cultivate it without stopping.</p><p></p><p>The progress bar went from one percent to two percent...</p><p></p><p>It was progressing slowly, and Ye Xiao estimated that he would not be able to reach the great perfection realm until evening, when he could return home and integrate it! However, at this moment, the door to the study was suddenly flung open, accompanied by a fragrant breeze, and Qin Yuyan, wrapped in a towel, came rushing in with her long legs.</p><p></p><p>The milky white shoulders and long legs made Ye Xiao a little dizzy.</p><p></p><p>Before he could react, Qin Yuyan grabbed him and ran outside.</p><p></p><p>"Quickly, come with me."</p><p></p><p>The osmanthus fragrance kept wafting into Ye Xiao's nose as Qin Yuyan ran, and in the blink of an eye, he was pulled into a room on the second floor and pushed inside.</p><p></p><p>"You must not say a word, my grandfather is back. If he finds out I brought a boy back, he'll kill me for sure."</p><p></p><p>She quickly closed the door and ran off in another direction.</p><p></p><p>"Yuyan, are you home?"</p><p></p><p>"Ah! I'm home, I'm going to take a bath and change clothes."</p><p></p><p>After that, there was no more sound, probably because Qin Shenglong had sat down in the living room.</p><p></p><p>Ye Xiao shook his head.</p><p></p><p>The Qin family's family discipline is quite strict.</p><p></p><p>As a senior student at the Martial Arts Academy, Luo Wanwan has already gotten married, while Qin Yuyan doesn't even dare to bring a boy home.</p><p></p><p>He glanced around the room and was surprised to find that it was decorated in an exceptionally cozy manner.</p><p></p><p>The small bed was in a pale yellow color, the quilt was yellow and pink, with cartoon patterns engraved on it.</p><p></p><p>The computer desk, the wardrobe... the overall decorative style was very feminine.</p><p></p><p>Hanging on the bedside was the dress Qin Yuyan had just taken off, as well as her bra, panties, and a pale white silk stocking.</p><p></p><p>"Could this be... Qin Yuyan's room?"</p><p></p><p>As soon as he said that, Huanliuli suddenly fell off the windowsill with a plop, and her originally small belly had now swollen up, looking like a woman who had been pregnant for ten months, completely unlike a cat's belly.</p><p></p><p>Qin Shenglong's voice came from downstairs again.</p><p></p><p>"Yuyan, what was that sound upstairs?"</p><p></p><p>"Oh, nothing, I just dropped the shampoo."</p><p></p><p>The voice became calm again, and Ye Xiao glared at Huanliuli with annoyance, using the spiritual communication channel:</p><p></p><p>"Did you steal the purple-scaled fish from her?"</p><p></p><p>Second update, support the new book.</p><p></p><p>(Chapter end)</p>

        <h1>Chapter 298</h1>
        <div class="content">
            <p>Here is the full English translation of the Chinese excerpt:</p><p></p><p>If the formation was opened, with the strength of the Wolf God, it could easily wipe out the entire Silver Fox Valley in a matter of minutes.</p><p></p><p>"The Wolf God is joking, these are just some simple natural treasures that are not worthy of the Wolf God's attention."</p><p></p><p>The Wolf God stared fixatedly into the eyes of the Fox Empress, his eyes filled with a chilling coldness.</p><p></p><p>"You are quite clever, but unfortunately, it's just superficial cleverness.</p><p></p><p>Now I'm giving you two choices - either you let me in, or I'll go in by myself."</p><p></p><p>The Fox Empress gritted her silver teeth. Facing the Wolf God's might, she felt a sense of trepidation, but she knew she couldn't back down at this moment, or it would be one mistake after another.</p><p></p><p>If the inheritance of Ning Yuhen was disrupted, it would be more serious for the Silver Fox Clan than being massacred, because that Emperor-level inheritance could potentially create an ultra-powerful divine beast expert! And there was also Ye Xiao, if he was interrupted in the process of comprehending it, he could be seriously injured.</p><p></p><p>At the peak of the King Realm, a heavy blow just short of the Emperor Realm, that was no trivial matter.</p><p></p><p>If handled poorly, it could put an end to his entire path to the Emperor Realm.</p><p></p><p>If such an event were to happen, the Silver Fox Clan would lose a powerful and close ally.</p><p></p><p>"The Wolf God has brought so many giant ships here today, and we of the Fox Clan are all weak women, so we don't dare to open the formation. I hope the Wolf God can understand."</p><p></p><p>The Wolf God's gaze was as cold as ice.</p><p></p><p>"Is it that you don't dare, or that you don't want to open it?"</p><p></p><p>The Fox Empress smiled apologetically. "The Wolf God is joking."</p><p></p><p>The Wolf God let out a long sigh.</p><p></p><p>"Fine, since that's the case, there's no need to waste more words with you. Break open this formation."</p><p></p><p>"Yes, sir!"</p><p></p><p>At the Wolf God's command, all the giant ships simultaneously unleashed their bombardment formation - a massive spiritual energy cannon formed by combining tremendous spiritual energy. On the starry battlefield, its power was boundless and unstoppable.</p><p></p><p>Huge beams of light rose from the ships, like sharp swords, bombarding the formation above the Silver Fox Valley relentlessly.</p><p></p><p>Boom, boom, boom - the deafening explosions rang out, with brilliant flashes of light. Although the attacks were blocked by the formation, the impact on the entire Silver Fox Valley could not be dissipated.</p><p></p><p>The entire Silver Fox Valley began to tremble violently.</p><p></p><p>The Fox Empress' expression changed drastically. She didn't expect the Wolf God to act so quickly, not even giving her time to react.</p><p></p><p>Countless Silver Fox Clan members' hearts were racing, pounding in their throats.</p><p></p><p>Even through the formation, they could clearly feel the tremendous impact force it was enduring.</p><p></p><p>How terrifying! </p><p></p><p>Even through the formation, they could feel such immense pressure. If there was no formation, would they be directly blasted to smithereens?</p><p></p><p>"Fox Empress, what do we do? The attack is so fierce, the formation can withstand it for a while, but if it goes on, it won't be able to hold out!"</p><p></p><p>The Fox Empress' expression was grave. "Have all the clan members retreat to the valley. After the formation is broken, we'll fight in the valley. Hold out as long as possible, try to keep as many clan members alive as we can. As long as Yuhen doesn't die, with the Chenxing Sutra, we can revive everyone."</p><p></p><p>"Understood!"</p><p></p><p>The Silver Fox Clan members immediately retreated to the lower part of the valley as instructed.</p><p></p><p>Above them, the bombardment on the formation was becoming increasingly intense.</p><p></p><p>The sense of oppression among the people was growing stronger and stronger.</p><p></p><p>Finally, after a few cracking sounds of shattering glass, the formation was ultimately destroyed.</p><p></p><p>A single Silver Fox Valley formation was simply too weak to resist the attack of a divine beast force.</p><p></p><p>The moment the formation was breached, several cannon blasts shot in, directly exploding in the Silver Fox Valley and instantly killing hundreds of Silver Fox Clan members.</p><p></p><p>"Fox Empress, what do we do?"</p><p></p><p>"Use the spiritual energy cannons to counterattack."</p><p></p><p>In the next moment, the bombardment from the Wolf God's fleet suddenly ceased, and a vast number of star beasts charged in, roaring furiously.</p><p></p><p>As an experienced divine beast veteran, the Wolf God was well aware of battle tactics. He knew that at this point, the Silver Fox Clan would definitely activate their spiritual energy cannons, which would cause significant damage to his ships. </p><p></p><p>In contrast, the lives of these star beasts were not valuable - they reproduced rapidly and came in many varieties. Launching a direct attack and engaging in close-quarters combat could prevent the Silver Fox Clan from using their spiritual energy cannons.</p><p></p><p>The Silver Fox Clan clearly lacked the deep combat experience of their opponent. Caught off guard, before they could even activate the formation to unleash the spiritual energy cannons, they were already engaged in close combat, which quickly escalated into the most intense and heated stage.</p><p></p><p>Divine Sect experts emerged, clashing with each other, while the Fox Empress was surrounded and attacked by four peak Divine Sect, semi-divine beast star beasts.</p><p></p><p>This was a battle of complete and utter domination, with the outcome predetermined from the very beginning.</p><p></p><p>The Silver Fox Clan members were ruthlessly slaughtered, and the Fox Empress was struggling to hold on.</p><p></p><p>Seeing her clansmen falling one by one beside her, her heart was filled with bitterness.</p><p></p><p>But there was nothing that could be done.</p><p></p><p>Once the Emperor-level inheritance appeared, the Silver Fox Valley had already been targeted. Ye Xiao's previous killing of Bingluoyu Rabbit and Hexi had at least diverted their attention for a while.</p><p></p><p>Otherwise, if the news of the Emperor-level inheritance had spread, it might not have been just one divine beast coming, but a whole group of them!</p><p></p><p>Even so, to resist a single divine beast, they had to pay an enormous price.</p><p></p><p>Here is the full English translation of the Chinese novel excerpt:</p><p></p><p>The Wolf God, after landing, immediately used his divine sense to scan the surroundings.</p><p></p><p>Soon, he furrowed his brows, and his vertical pupils became even more sharp.</p><p></p><p>"This feeling? Able to completely shield my divine consciousness? Quite interesting."</p><p></p><p>With that, he started walking towards the direction of the Imperial Inheritance.</p><p></p><p>As a powerful demigod beast, the fact that the other side could shield his consciousness was enough to indicate that it was no simple matter.</p><p></p><p>"Not good!" </p><p></p><p>The Vixen Queen's mind sank, and despite her injuries, she forcefully accelerated the operation of her cultivation technique, temporarily driving away the four demigod beasts. The next step, she quickly rushed towards the Wolf God.</p><p></p><p>"Trying to run? No way!" </p><p></p><p>The four demigod beasts would not give her a chance to escape, and in an instant, they chased after her again, biting her tightly, not allowing her to flee at all.</p><p></p><p>The Wolf God did not even turn back to look at her.</p><p></p><p>In this battle, with his subordinates taking action, he did not need to consider it at all.</p><p></p><p>Here, he was an outsider, an outsider that no one could influence.</p><p></p><p>He could roam freely on the battlefield, strolling leisurely.</p><p></p><p>Finally, he quickly arrived in front of the Imperial Inheritance ruins.</p><p></p><p>At this moment, his huge vertical pupils suddenly became excited.</p><p></p><p>"Haha! I knew it! The Silver Fox Clan has been hiding something all along. </p><p>Unexpectedly, it is this. The Imperial Inheritance of the Human Clan! Although I can only sense a faint aura, this is definitely the powerful presence of the Imperial Realm!"</p><p></p><p>The Vixen Queen had already been subdued, the four demigod beasts had broken her limbs and suppressed her with spiritual energy, just waiting for the Wolf God's judgment.</p><p></p><p>"Stop! That is the ancestral site of my Fox Clan, you are not allowed to desecrate it!"</p><p></p><p>As soon as the words left her mouth, one of the demigod beasts stepped on her face with one foot, burying her head into the ground.</p><p></p><p>"Shut up, you old hag. What are you? Do you think you can stop the great Wolf God?"</p><p></p><p>The Wolf God did not turn back at all throughout, he had already reached out to try and open the door of the Imperial Inheritance ruins.</p><p></p><p>But at this moment, the door suddenly creaked open on its own.</p><p></p><p>A silver light suddenly shot out from beside the Wolf God, brushing past him.</p><p></p><p>Afterwards, the door closed on its own.</p><p></p><p>The Wolf God's brows slightly raised, and he slightly turned his head back to take a look. His vertical pupils immediately tightened.</p><p></p><p>The four demigod beasts, at this moment, had their beast heads flying up, accompanied by fresh blood, spinning in the air.</p><p></p><p>And the Vixen Queen had been embraced by a figure, who was using the secret Silver Fox Clan technique, the Chenxing Technique, to quickly heal the Vixen Queen's injuries.</p><p></p><p>"Ning Yutian, you succeeded!"</p><p></p><p>The Vixen Queen was extremely excited, and Ning Yutian nodded with a faint smile:</p><p></p><p>"I did not disappoint Grandaunt's expectations. I obtained the inheritance of the ancestors of the Silver Fox Clan."</p><p></p><p>"What is your current cultivation now?"</p><p></p><p>"Demigod Realm!"</p><p></p><p>Hearing these words, the Vixen Queen's eyes reddened with excitement.</p><p></p><p>"Good! Good! Good!"</p><p></p><p>She repeatedly said the word "good", her heart so excited that she was at a loss for words.</p><p></p><p>Ning Yutian, at such a young age, had already broken through to the Demigod Realm, and his future prospects of surpassing the Godly Realm were very promising.</p><p></p><p>At this time, Ning Yutian had already healed and put down the Vixen Queen.</p><p></p><p>"Grandaunt, you go first to deal with those small fries, this dog thing is left to me."</p><p></p><p>The Vixen Queen nodded, Ning Yutian had already entered the King Realm, and could definitely contend against the Wolf God. As for the other demigod beasts, they had all been slain by Ning Yutian, the remaining ones were only at the level of Godly Sect, including the Stardust Beasts below the Godly Realm, which she was not afraid of at all.</p><p></p><p>The Wolf God was not panicked, he just smiled faintly as he looked at him, even with a hint of excitement.</p><p></p><p>He could see that Ning Yutian was young, and that at such a young age, he had already reached the Demigod Realm, so the Imperial Inheritance must have many good things!</p><p></p><p>"Kid, breaking through to the Demigod Realm at such a young age is not a good thing."</p><p></p><p>"Whether it's good or not, it's not for you to decide!" </p><p></p><p>Ning Yutian stepped on the Heavenly Dipper, rushing towards the opponent.</p><p></p><p>The Wolf God led his troops to slaughter recklessly in the Silver Fox Valley, this debt of blood, he must personally behead the other party to be satisfied.</p><p></p><p>But the Wolf God was not inferior either, almost as soon as Ning Yutian made his move, he also made his move.</p><p></p><p>The two collided head-on.</p><p></p><p>Boom! Accompanied by a violent explosion, the energy impact between the two sides immediately overturned countless battling Stardust Beasts.</p><p></p><p>It even leveled all the hills and pits within a ten-kilometer radius, forming a huge flat circular area with a diameter of over ten kilometers.</p><p></p><p>This was just one move.</p><p></p><p>Afterwards, the two turned into two bolts of lightning, one in dark green and one in silver-white, like two sword beams, constantly exploding in the sky.</p><p></p><p>Boom boom boom... There were huge light balls everywhere in the sky, each light ball representing a clash between the two, representing the impact of two huge energies.</p><p></p><p>The stars in the sky seemed to have shifted at this moment!</p>

        <h1>Chapter 4</h1>
        <div class="content">
            <p>Here is the full English translation of the Chinese excerpt:</p><p></p><p>The fundamental sword techniques consist of seven forms, and the seven sword techniques that Ye Xiao is currently cultivating are the seven fundamental forms, which are sufficient for him to combine them into one.</p><p></p><p>"To combine the sword techniques, I need to circulate my spiritual soul, and it's easy to be discovered in the library."</p><p></p><p>Ye Xiao pondered for a moment, then turned his gaze to the window outside.</p><p></p><p>At this time, it was still dark, and the entire Jianghai City was shrouded in darkness.</p><p></p><p>"If I remember correctly, there should be a river behind this library, and it's sparsely populated. The clock-in time for work is still early, so why not..."</p><p></p><p>Ye Xiao locked the door and leaped out of the window, leaving the library.</p><p></p><p>This was the first time Ye Xiao had left the library since arriving in this world.</p><p></p><p>The streets were very empty, and the only thing visible was a sanitation worker in the distance under the streetlight, using what seemed to be a variant of the sweeping technique from the Chuzhou Shaolin Martial Arts Academy, which Ye Xiao had read about in the books.</p><p></p><p>A cool breeze blew, giving him a slight chill, but before he could react, the cultivation technique he was practicing started circulating the spiritual energy within his body, shielding him from the cold.</p><p></p><p>The two fundamental cultivation techniques Ye Xiao was practicing were called the Nourishing Heart Scripture and the Absorbing Qi Technique. The speed of absorbing spiritual energy was not fast, but there were too many pirated versions, so he couldn't easily upgrade to higher-level cultivation techniques.</p><p></p><p>Exhaling a deep breath, he moved his feet and started running towards the river.</p><p></p><p>Ye Xiao's speed was not slow, roughly equivalent to a car traveling at 80 miles per hour. However, his movement technique was still just a basic one, and if he could combine it with a higher-level movement technique, he might be able to cover a distance of thousands or even tens of thousands of meters in a single step.</p><p></p><p>The scenery around him quickly receded, and soon, Ye Xiao arrived at the riverbank, which was dozens of miles away from the library.</p><p></p><p>The river was fast-flowing, and the banks were overgrown with weeds, a stark contrast to the modern city. The river was about 200 meters wide, not a large river, but more of a tributary.</p><p></p><p>Across the river was the largest martial arts academy in Jianghai City, Ye Xiao's alma mater, and there were no other buildings, so he wouldn't be discovered.</p><p></p><p>Ye Xiao jumped onto a shallow sandbank, calmed his thoughts, and began to perform the first set of sword techniques.</p><p></p><p>To combine the sword techniques, he needed to go through the seven fundamental forms in order.</p><p></p><p>As Ye Xiao executed the sword techniques, an invisible long sword formed from condensed spiritual energy appeared in his hand.</p><p></p><p>Martial artists who had reached the seventh rank or above could release spiritual energy over short distances to form defensive barriers or offensive weapons.</p><p></p><p>It was said that once one's cultivation broke through the Xiantian realm, they could completely release spiritual energy, and a single move could attack targets hundreds of meters away.</p><p></p><p>As Ye Xiao's speed increased, a golden light began to emanate from him, making him appear like a divine being descended from the heavens.</p><p></p><p>Many mosquitoes and insects were attracted to the light, but as soon as they approached within 10 meters of Ye Xiao, they were instantly shredded and fell to the ground, forming a small pile of insect corpses.</p><p></p><p>Invisible to the naked eye, a domain of sword qi had formed within a 10-meter radius around Ye Xiao.</p><p></p><p>At the same time, the seven pages in the golden book of fundamental sword techniques within Ye Xiao's spiritual soul manifested the seven characters corresponding to each technique: Pull! Rotate! Chop! Slash! Break! Sweep! Annihilate!</p><p></p><p>Here is the full English translation of the excerpt from the Chinese novel:</p><p></p><p>The foundation of the Sword Technique formed a large character.</p><p></p><p>The moment the last character was formed, the seven sheets of paper instantly merged into one, revealing an extremely powerful and domineering technique!</p><p></p><p>The Tyrannical Sword!</p><p></p><p>Boom! The golden book let out a trembling force, and then began an even more powerful operation, like a huge machine being activated.</p><p></p><p>Ye Xiao clearly felt that if before, the operation speed of his technique was like a thin tap, then at this moment, it was like a high-pressure water cannon, reaching a level that could kill.</p><p></p><p>Due to the operation of the technique, his two basic cultivation methods also accelerated rapidly, and at this time, Ye Xiao's cultivation bottleneck that had not been broken through for a long time was finally broken through, reaching the First Realm of the Innate Stage! Entering the Sect!</p><p></p><p>"I have entered the Sect!"</p><p></p><p>Ye Xiao's face lit up with joy. Although he was a Buddhist at heart, he couldn't help but have some emotional fluctuations when he had such a great breakthrough. He had not yet reached the realm of the Saint.</p><p></p><p>At this moment, Ye Xiao felt that he was no longer just an ant. Although his body was only human-sized, his perception had already radiated hundreds of meters away.</p><p></p><p>This feeling was like your body growing to a hundred meters, and your vision, hearing, and all five senses being upgraded to the standard of a hundred meters.</p><p></p><p>At the same time, his qi and blood also became extremely powerful! "I heard that the lifespan of a Master will be extended by decades, or even a century. It seems to be true."</p><p></p><p>After the joy, Ye Xiao looked around and saw no one, and a surge of hot-blooded fighting spirit rose in his heart.</p><p></p><p>He looked at the flowing river in front of him, took a deep breath, and exerted all the spiritual energy in his body to unleash the Tyrannical Sword.</p><p></p><p>A golden light sword suddenly extended from his hand, soaring high into the sky, and in an instant, it spread over a hundred meters, directly slashing through the dark sky and illuminating the surface of the river.</p><p></p><p>Then, Ye Xiao slashed the sword down onto the surface of the river, and with a thunderous boom, the entire river surface was directly split open, over two hundred meters wide and twenty meters deep, being ruthlessly split open by Ye Xiao's sword for several meters, all the way to the river bottom, even tearing open the mud several meters deep.</p><p></p><p>A sword mark over seven hundred meters long extended from one bank of the river to the other.</p><p></p><p>"Damn!"</p><p></p><p>This shocking sight directly made Ye Xiao blurt out a curse. This power was a bit too much, wasn't it? Even wuxia novels wouldn't dare to write it like this! It was truly "slashing the river with a sword, consuming two mouthfuls of rice."</p><p></p><p>Too terrifying!</p><p></p><p>No wonder this world reveres martial artists. This power is countless times stronger than modern technology. Because this attack can be unleashed whenever you want, while modern technology requires various channels to be built, and the number of times it can be used is limited, like a bomb, only one, and it's gone after being used.</p><p></p><p>However, at this moment, Ye Xiao's keen perception clearly sensed several powerful forces rapidly approaching this direction.</p><p></p><p>"Discovered?"</p><p></p><p>He furrowed his brows slightly, stomped his foot, and instantly turned into a black shadow, leaving in another direction.</p><p></p><p>After breaking through to the Sect Master realm, his speed was even faster than before, about three times faster.</p><p></p><p>This meant that his speed had reached 240 codes, which was almost the limit of a family sedan.</p><p></p><p>(End of this chapter)</p>

        <h1>Chapter 189</h1>
        <div class="content">
            <p>Here is the full English translation of the excerpt from the Chinese novel:</p><p></p><p>Qin Yuyan's mind stirred.</p><p></p><p>"Senior Yue, what's wrong?"</p><p></p><p>Yue Xinling's face was grave as she said, "Something is approaching."</p><p></p><p>The next moment, a massive force suddenly plummeted down, directly collapsing half of the secret chamber, with dust and smoke billowing. A towering figure rapidly descended into the secret chamber.</p><p></p><p>Qin Yuyan's expression changed, and Yue Xinling immediately shielded her behind her.</p><p></p><p>"Senior Yue, what is this?"</p><p></p><p>"It's a star beast, and it's a star beast that has descended from the starry battlefield, at the Shenzong level!"</p><p></p><p>Hearing the words "Shenzong level", Qin Yuyan's pupils instantly constricted, and her heartbeat began to accelerate rapidly.</p><p></p><p>It was actually a Shenzong level star beast. </p><p></p><p>This level was far beyond what she could handle!</p><p></p><p>Only Shenzong level experts could deal with it.</p><p></p><p>As the dust gradually dissipated, the opponent's figure and face were fully revealed to Qin Yuyan and Yue Xinling. It was a humanoid star beast that looked like a cockroach, with an extremely tall stature and a pure golden armor covering its body, which was extremely intimidating.</p><p></p><p>"So you are the newly awakened imperial bloodline of the human race? Innate third-grade, it seems you're not much either! </p><p></p><p>Well, it's better this way, it will save me a lot of trouble."</p><p></p><p>As soon as the words fell, Yue Xinling slashed out with a sword.</p><p></p><p>The sword beam released a hundred-zhang distance, directly tearing the ceiling above and falling on the opponent's head.</p><p></p><p>Boom! Accompanied by a violent explosion, flames shot into the sky, and dust and smoke rose.</p><p></p><p>Yue Xinling turned and pulled Qin Yuyan, leaving directly.</p><p></p><p>The students outside, startled, had already begun to flee rapidly, and the piercing alarm sounded throughout the campus.</p><p></p><p>The two rose into the air, glancing down, and as the smoke gradually dissipated, that towering figure was still unharmed.</p><p></p><p>"How is this possible?" </p><p></p><p>Qin Yuyan couldn't help but exclaim in shock.</p><p></p><p>Yue Xinling was a Shenzong expert at the innate seventh-grade, but her sword strike had not caused any damage to the opponent!</p><p></p><p>"It's innate eighth-grade!"</p><p></p><p>"What!" </p><p></p><p>Qin Yuyan's heart trembled in fear. It was actually an innate eighth-grade cultivator! How could there be such a powerful star beast coming to the ground.</p><p></p><p>But before she could be shocked again, a violent explosion suddenly came from another direction.</p><p></p><p>Boom! The two were startled, looking down at the ground, and at some point, Chixu had also encountered an enemy. His left shoulder was already torn, his shoulder stained with red, and he had used spiritual energy to seal it, preventing excessive blood loss.</p><p></p><p>Yue Xinling's expression became even more serious, and not only was Chixu's cultivation at the innate seventh-grade, but the special material armor he wore, which could rival a Zongshi-grade armor, had still been severely damaged.</p><p></p><p>This meant that the opponent who had injured Chixu was also no ordinary person.</p><p></p><p>Sure enough, the next moment, a figure slowly emerged from the dust, stepping towards Chixu.</p><p></p><p>She had a voluptuous figure, even stronger than Yue Xinling's. </p><p></p><p>If Yue Xinling was a pineapple bun, then she was a six-inch cake!</p><p></p><p>On her head, there were also a pair of dark green horns that emitted a strange glow.</p><p></p><p>"Yue Xinling, quickly take Qin Yuyan and leave, I'll hold them off here, but I can only hold them for half a minute at most. This one is also an innate eighth-grade Shenzong level star beast."</p><p></p><p>Yue Xinling's heart trembled, without further ado, she immediately turned and left.</p><p></p><p>Two innate eighth-grade Shenzong level star beasts, this was beyond what the two of them could handle.</p><p></p><p>Even if she stayed, it would only result in more casualties.</p><p></p><p>The only thing she could do now was to take Qin Yuyan away and minimize the losses.</p><p></p><p>"Old Chixu, please don't die!"</p><p></p><p>Although she said this, Yue Xinling knew in her heart that Chixu's chances of survival were less than half.</p><p></p><p>After all, they were facing two innate eighth-grade Shenzong level star beasts!</p><p></p><p>However, just as she turned to leave, the next moment, another extremely powerful force attacked, directly piercing through her abdomen.</p><p></p><p>"Pu chi."</p><p></p><p>"Senior Yue!"</p><p></p><p>Qin Yuyan's heart bled with sorrow, but this was not the end, because the next moment, a sword beam of lightning-fast speed came attacking.</p><p></p><p>The sword beam flashed, and Yue Xinling, holding Qin Yuyan's arm, was directly severed, and then an even greater force directly blew her away, her whereabouts unknown.</p><p></p><p>The next moment, a delicate white hand, like an eagle's claw, firmly grasped Qin Yuyan's shoulder, holding her like an eagle catching a chick, making her unable to break free.</p><p></p><p>"Let me go!"</p><p></p><p>Qin Yuyan roared angrily, her eyes reddening.</p><p></p><p>Yue Xinling had taught her for several days, and she was almost like her teacher, but was now severely injured by the opponent, and her life was unknown. Qin Yuyan was furious to the extreme.</p><p></p><p>She pounded the opponent with all her might, but unfortunately, it had no effect at all.</p><p></p><p>As an innate third-grade cultivator, she was completely unable to cause any harm to the opponent.</p><p></p><p>"Insects!"</p><p></p><p>The star beast sneered contemptuously, not placing Qin Yuyan in its eyes at all.</p><p></p><p>At this moment, suddenly, a sword beam attacked, aiming for the star beast's back.</p><p></p><p>She narrowed her eyes, and a pair of golden wings appeared on her back. As soon as the wings emerged, her movements became invisible, and she had already evaded.</p><p></p><p>"When did you insects on the human race's territory get permission to come in?"</p><p></p><p>It was Liuxun who had arrived!</p><p></p><p>The star beast holding Qin Yuyan narrowed its eyes slightly.</p><p></p><p>"Innate eighth-grade Shenzong? Quite interesting."</p><p></p><p>A deep fighting intent flashed in its eyes.</p><p></p><p>The star beasts always followed the rule of the strong devouring the weak, and they would destroy...</p><p></p><p>Here is the full English translation of the Chinese excerpt:</p><p></p><p>These weak human beings held no real significance to them. Instead, they preferred to challenge those of their own level or even stronger human tribes.</p><p></p><p>The aura within her began to surge upwards.</p><p></p><p>However, before she could make a move, the star beast that had first appeared slowly rose up from the secret chamber, its gaze icy cold.</p><p></p><p>"This human is mine. Suzan, you and Moyu take the imperial bloodline of the humans away, do not ruin the great matter of the Tiger God Lord!"</p><p></p><p>Hearing the words "Tiger God", Suzan was somewhat unwilling, but could only shrug her shoulders.</p><p></p><p>"Alright, we'll leave this one to you. Don't play too wildly, be careful that other powerful humans don't come over. </p><p>Although this ground is not as formidable as the starry sky battlefield, there are still many experts here."</p><p></p><p>"I know."</p><p></p><p>Chiming gritted his teeth and said, "You won't take her away!"</p><p></p><p>The moment the words left his mouth, the burly star beast suddenly appeared before him, slamming a punch into his body.</p><p></p><p>Boom! The huge force instantly blasted him away like a cannon shell, instantly shattering his ribs.</p><p></p><p>"You have no right to speak!" </p><p></p><p>Its face revealed a mocking and contemptuous gaze, staring directly at the distant Liu Chengxun.</p><p></p><p>Liu Chengxun did not make a move, not because he didn't want to, but because he couldn't. </p><p></p><p>There were three innate eighth-grade spirit sect star beasts here, and with his own strength alone, he had no chance of contending against them.</p><p></p><p>At most, he could only fight one, if he lost control of the situation and was surrounded by the other two star beasts, even he himself would die here.</p><p></p><p>Suzan and Moyu, carrying Qin Yuyan, flew towards the starry sky, while the burly star beast twisted its neck.</p><p></p><p>"Human, I haven't encountered a suitable opponent in a long time, I hope you won't disappoint me."</p><p></p><p>"Me too."</p><p></p><p>Liu Chengxun's mind flickered as he summoned a sword emanating a chilling aura from his storage ring, his aura suddenly surging.</p><p></p><p>At the same time, Ye Xiao, who had just been eating at home, also sensed this extraordinary aura.</p><p></p><p>"This is... Innate eighth-grade? And not just one? They're star beasts?"</p><p></p><p>Ye Xiao paused for a moment.</p><p></p><p>He never expected there would be eighth-grade star beasts coming to him.</p><p></p><p>He had been thinking that if he could get a few innate eighth-grade star beasts, the blood energy he could replenish every day would make him even stronger.</p><p></p><p>Unexpectedly, they had arrived so soon.</p><p></p><p>Go take a look, see if any are suitable for the breeding grounds?</p><p></p><p>Without wasting any time, Ye Xiao wiped the corners of his mouth with a napkin and quickly flew out.</p><p></p><p>Since they had come to him, he didn't need to go looking for them.</p><p></p><p>But just as he flew out, a blood-stained figure flew over from the direction of the Jianghai Martial Arts Academy.</p><p></p><p>Ye Xiao's brow furrowed slightly as he reached out and firmly grasped the other's arm.</p><p></p><p>Such a heavy injury! The other's abdomen had been stabbed by a sword, and one of their arms had been severed.</p><p></p><p>The scent of blood permeated the air.</p><p></p><p>It seems the higher the cultivation of the star beasts, the more brutal they are.</p><p></p><p>With a thought, the Chenxing Technique went into a frenzy, completely repairing the other's body.</p><p></p><p>Lele Xin had originally suffered a heavy blow and was in a coma, but suddenly felt a warm power enveloping her. In an instant, all the pain disappeared.</p><p></p><p>But before she could get a good look at the other person, she was simply thrown down.</p><p></p><p>Boom! She smashed into the ground, creating several cracks, but as a Spirit Sect cultivator, she was unharmed, just feeling very bewildered as she got up from the ground.</p><p></p><p>"Could this be the legendary Sword and Knife Immortal of Jianghai City?"</p><p></p><p>Indeed, he is truly a powerful expert, casually healing her like that, his healing abilities must have surpassed even the greatest Healing Masters. But throwing her away so roughly, that was a bit unconventional.</p><p></p><p>In fact, Ye Xiao had only casually healed her as a small matter. Normally, he wouldn't have been so rough in treating her after healing her, but now there were three eighth-grade star beasts ahead, the situation was a bit urgent, and he didn't have much time to bother with Lele Xin.</p><p></p><p>Just a simple healing was enough.</p><p></p><p>But what he didn't expect was that as soon as he flew out, another figure came flying over.</p><p></p><p>Chest and ribs completely shattered!</p><p></p><p>Another severely injured Spirit Sect cultivator! "Another one?"</p><p></p><p>Ye Xiao sensed that two innate eighth-grade star beast auras were already leaving.</p><p></p><p>Ignoring the other person, he condensed the ultimate healing energy of the Healing Technique with his palm and injected it into their body, then used the Divine Meaning Technique to rush towards the Jianghai Martial Arts Academy at an even faster speed.</p>

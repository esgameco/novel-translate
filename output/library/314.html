        <h1>Chapter 314</h1>
        <div class="content">
            <p>Here is the full English translation of the Chinese excerpt:</p><p></p><p>"And for you, Ye Xiaoyou, I'm afraid there won't be any more opportunities for us to dine together in the future."</p><p></p><p>Liu Chengxun had resigned himself to his fate.</p><p></p><p>The trend was inevitable - the human race was destined to fall, and this was something that no one could change.</p><p></p><p>And if the human race was to perish, then even less could be said for him, a mere Godly Sect cultivator.</p><p></p><p>At this moment, he was just a tiny, insignificant ant unable to change his own destiny.</p><p></p><p>The attacks from the six peak Godly Sect Celestial Beasts had reached him, their brilliant techniques illuminating his face. The powerful aura contained within the six Godly Sect peak attacks was forcefully suppressing him, leaving him with no chance of escape, even if he was not already severely injured.</p><p></p><p>In fact, even if there was no aura suppressing him, he would still be unable to escape.</p><p></p><p>The next moment would be his moment of death.</p><p></p><p>However! Just as he was facing certain doom, an unexpected event occurred.</p><p></p><p>The sword that had fallen beside him suddenly erupted in a dazzlingly brilliant light!</p><p></p><p>This light was even more powerful than the light of the six Godly Sect peak attacks, its aura completely overwhelming them.</p><p></p><p>The suffocating sensation, accompanied by the sword light, flashed and soared into the sky.</p><p></p><p>In the moment the light disappeared, the six Godly Sect peak Celestial Beasts had all turned to ash, no longer existing.</p><p></p><p>Liu Chengxun was dumbfounded, frozen in place.</p><p></p><p>He never could have imagined that his sword contained such a powerful technique.</p><p></p><p>The speed was so fast that he still hadn't fully processed it, his mind not yet fully catching up.</p><p></p><p>How could his Imperial Weapon sword possibly contain such a mighty sword light? The armorer who had repaired the weapon could not have achieved this level.</p><p></p><p>Because there was no way anyone in the world, after cultivating to such a powerful level, could also have forged their craftsmanship to the point of creating an Imperial Weapon.</p><p></p><p>The only explanation was that after the sword was completed, a supremely powerful expert had sealed an incredibly strong sword light within it.</p><p></p><p>Wait a minute.</p><p></p><p>He suddenly seemed to have realized something.</p><p></p><p>This sword was the one that Ye Xiao had someone help him reforge.</p><p></p><p>But how could Ye Xiao have found an armorer capable of forging an Imperial Weapon? That level of armorer would never casually associate with ordinary people.</p><p></p><p>At first, Liu Chengxun had thought that perhaps the reclusive expert had some peculiar personality traits and had taken a liking to Ye Xiao, which is why they became friends.</p><p></p><p>But now, he suddenly realized that was not the case.</p><p></p><p>It was because Ye Xiao himself was also an expert, which is why the other party was willing to befriend him.</p><p></p><p>This sword light must have been sealed in by Ye Xiao himself.</p><p></p><p>So when he had expressed regret at not being able to see the Sword Immortal senior before leaving, Ye Xiao had said that he would definitely meet the Sword Immortal senior in the future.</p><p></p><p>Because Ye Xiao himself was the Sword Immortal!</p><p></p><p>No wonder, no wonder he had felt there was something unusual about Ye Xiao the first time he met him.</p><p></p><p>That state of mind was absolutely not something an ordinary person could possess.</p><p></p><p>It was laughable that he had been so foolish as to not detect anything strange.</p><p></p><p>But thinking about it carefully, it wasn't really his fault.</p><p></p><p>Firstly, Ye Xiao's strength was too great, and because his power was so overwhelming, Liu Chengxun was unable to sense the true extent of his cultivation.</p><p></p><p>Secondly, Ye Xiao was simply too young! At his age, as long as he was a normal person, it would be extremely difficult for anyone to easily guess his identity.</p><p></p><p>"This little brat! He's tricked me for so long. But who would have thought that the renowned Sword Immortal would only be twenty-one years old? Haha, this little brat!"</p><p></p><p>Liu Chengxun broke into a silly, childlike grin.</p><p></p><p>After decades of living, this was the first time he had laughed so joyfully like a child.</p><p></p><p>On Ye Xiao's side, he had brought Ning Yuthen and the others back to their dormitory, and Illusion Jade Lotus immediately approached.</p><p></p><p>"Master, you must be tired. Have a sip of water."</p><p></p><p>Ye Xiao took the tea and took a sip.</p><p></p><p>"I've temporarily cleared the Celestial Beasts from the skies above Jianghai City. Other areas may still need my assistance. I'll go out for a bit, and you three - the two Celestial Beasts and the half-beast - don't wander out, lest you cause any disturbances.</p><p></p><p>If you encounter any trouble, just go to the breeding grounds, there are formations there that others can't enter."</p><p></p><p>"Understood."</p><p></p><p>After giving Ning Yuthen a few instructions, Ye Xiao left Jianghai City.</p><p></p><p>It wasn't that he was afraid others would harm them, as their three powers - a Godly Beast realm, a Ninth-Grade Godly Sect cultivator, and a Grand Master - would be difficult for anyone in Jianghai City to contend with.</p><p></p><p>Ye Xiao was just worried that if they went out, they might cause a commotion and disturb the peace of the citizens.</p><p></p><p>After Ye Xiao left, Ning Yuthen looked at the Illusion Jade Lotus in front of him and couldn't help but raise an eyebrow.</p><p></p><p>"Why do I feel like I've seen you somewhere before? Have we met?"</p><p></p><p>"Of course we've met, I'm that cat. Don't you remember?"</p><p></p><p>Hearing this, Ning Yuthen's face couldn't help but twitch violently.</p><p></p><p>Illusion Jade Lotus was that cat? He had never seen Illusion Jade Lotus transform into a human form before, so he didn't know.</p><p></p><p>Here is the full English translation of the Chinese excerpt:</p><p></p><p>The Appearance.</p><p></p><p>When he suddenly came to the manager's dormitory and saw a cat-eared beautiful girl in a black silk uniform, he thought the manager had some special fetish and didn't dare to speak up.</p><p></p><p>However, he never expected that the girl was actually Huan Liuli. But the shock was not over yet.</p><p></p><p>When he carefully examined Huan Liuli's cultivation, his eyes suddenly narrowed.</p><p></p><p>"You've already reached the peak of the Ninth Heavenly Dao Sovereign Realm?"</p><p></p><p>Huan Liuli nodded.</p><p></p><p>"Yeah! What's wrong? Is that not allowed?"</p><p></p><p>"No, I remember that the manager's strength wasn't that strong when I left. At that time, your cultivation shouldn't have been this strong either, right?"</p><p></p><p>Ning Yuthen knew very well that Ye Xiao's strength at the time had not broken through the King Realm.</p><p></p><p>But he also knew that Ye Xiao's talent was so strong that he could rise to the Emperor Realm so quickly.</p><p></p><p>But how about Huan Liuli? She was just a phantom cat. In terms of bloodline, she was also a dragon-level bloodline, the same as the Silver Fox Clan.</p><p></p><p>If he hadn't entered the Emperor Realm Relic, his cultivation wouldn't have improved so quickly, and he was still at the Eighth Heavenly Dao Realm. How could he have broken through to the Deity Beast Realm?</p><p></p><p>Moreover, he had the full support of the Silver Fox Clan and a huge amount of resources.</p><p></p><p>Huan Liuli didn't have those, and she hadn't even entered the Emperor Realm Relic.</p><p></p><p>However, her current strength had already reached the peak of the Ninth Heavenly Dao Sovereign Realm, just one realm away.</p><p></p><p>Could it be that being with the manager, her cultivation speed increased so quickly?</p><p></p><p>Huan Liuli nodded.</p><p></p><p>"Yes, when you left, I was just a Sovereign. Now I've become the peak of the Ninth Heavenly Dao Sovereign Realm."</p><p></p><p>Ning Yuthen's face couldn't help but twitch violently again.</p><p></p><p>It hadn't even been a year since he left, and Huan Liuli had gone from being a Sovereign to a Deity Sovereign.</p><p></p><p>This is too monstrous! No, no, no! He must also find a way to communicate and interact more with the manager.</p><p></p><p>A hundred years is not enough.</p><p></p><p>Decided, he will serve under the manager for five hundred years!</p><p></p><p>In five hundred years, Ning Yuthen was confident that he could learn something from the manager.</p><p></p><p>"You two can sit here for a while. I need to go feed the creatures in the breeding ground."</p><p></p><p>Ning Yuthen smiled and said, "Are those small animals raised by the manager? Let me help then."</p><p></p><p>When he was in the Silver Fox Valley, he had asked Ye Xiao about his hobbies during his leisure time, and Ye Xiao had told him that he liked to grow flowers and plants and raise small animals.</p><p></p><p>Since he wanted to follow the manager, he must learn these small tasks in advance, otherwise how could he help the manager in the future?</p><p></p><p>Huan Liuli felt Ning Yuthen's words were a bit strange.</p><p></p><p>But then she thought about it, those star beasts, although very powerful, were just a group of small animals in front of Ye Xiao, so she nodded again.</p><p></p><p>"Yes, those little things."</p><p></p><p>"Then what do we use to feed them?"</p><p></p><p>"Of course, it's the flowers and plants that the master has planted."</p><p></p><p>Huan Liuli pointed to the flowerpots in the corner.</p><p></p><p>"Okay, I'll pull them out."</p><p></p><p>However, when Ning Yuthen rolled up his sleeves and walked over to take a closer look, he was completely dumbfounded.</p><p></p><p>Due to the restrictions left by Ye Xiao, his King Realm spiritual sense could not detect anything in this room, and he could only see it with his eyes like an ordinary person.</p><p></p><p>What did he see? A flowerpot forged from a thousand-year-old meteorite, infused with spatial power, and filled with all kinds of precious materials.</p><p></p><p>Ginseng that was thousands of years old, and precious alchemy materials that were several thousand years old.</p><p></p><p>Huh? These are the "flowers and plants" the manager was talking about?</p><p></p><p>If these are flowers and plants, then what are the "expensive" ornamental flowers and plants that cost tens of thousands to import and planted in the flower beds outside the library?</p><p></p><p>"The manager actually uses these things to feed the little animals?"</p><p></p><p>Huan Liuli nodded seriously.</p><p></p><p>"Yes, what else can we use to feed them?"</p><p></p><p>Yuwei also saw this scene, and her brain was already a bit overwhelmed.</p><p></p><p>Is the Emperor Realm really this amazing? The things that Ye Xiao casually called "worthless" turned out to be priceless treasures.</p><p></p><p>At this moment, Huan Liuli had already noticed the shock of the two people, and she suddenly thought of a very fun thing.</p><p></p><p>"Let's go feed the little animals quickly! They must be starving to death. The master will be unhappy if we don't."</p><p></p><p>"Oh, okay!"</p><p></p><p>Ning Yuthen nodded his head stiffly, then quickly walked forward and pulled out some precious materials.</p><p></p><p>When pulling out these things, he felt his heart was bleeding.</p><p></p><p>Although he was already at the Deity Beast Realm, comparable to the King Realm existence of the human race, he was not too lacking in these things.</p><p></p><p>But thinking that Ye Xiao used these things to feed the little animals every day, he felt a pang of heartache.</p>

        <h1>Chapter 290</h1>
        <div class="content">
            <p>Here is the full English translation of the Chinese excerpt:</p><p></p><p>The dark shadow was flashing quickly through the Silver Fox Valley. Its speed was extremely fast, and its presence was well-concealed, so that no one could detect it at all.</p><p></p><p>In this way, it soon penetrated deep into the interior of the Silver Fox Valley.</p><p></p><p>Seeing the patrolling soldiers coming and going in the valley, an undisguised mocking expression appeared in its eyes.</p><p></p><p>"What a bunch of useless fellows! Not a single one of them has discovered me. They say the Silver Fox Clan is very powerful, but now they don't seem to be much at all.</p><p></p><p>However, the methods of I, Tian Kuixing, are not something that just anyone can easily see through.</p><p></p><p>As a Xiantian Seventh-Grade Saint Monarch, combined with the superb stealth techniques I have already cultivated, for the Silver Fox Clan to detect me would be truly unbelievable.</p><p></p><p>In that case, the Silver Fox Clan would be far more formidable than they are now."</p><p></p><p>After mocking them for a while, his gaze fell upon the buildings of the Silver Fox Clan.</p><p></p><p>To obtain intelligence, he must certainly inquire from the members of the Silver Fox Clan. He must capture a Silver Fox Clan member for questioning.</p><p></p><p>The central Silver Fox Palace was heavily guarded, with too many people, so it was definitely not a good idea to go there and get himself killed.</p><p></p><p>The residential areas on both sides were closely connected, so if he moved against one of the foxes, and it made even the slightest sound, all the others would discover him.</p><p></p><p>At that point, even if he wanted to leave, he wouldn't be able to.</p><p></p><p>As he was thinking, his gaze fell upon a remote house in the distance.</p><p></p><p>There, two members of the Silver Fox Clan were standing guard, which made his eyes light up.</p><p></p><p>"Found it."</p><p></p><p>Their position was very secluded, far from here, and not easily visible.</p><p></p><p>As long as his speed was fast enough, he could easily capture both of them without anyone noticing.</p><p></p><p>Then he would use his spiritual search to directly probe their memories and easily obtain the information about the human emperor's inheritance relic.</p><p></p><p>After confirming this, he would immediately leave and pass the news to the powerful figures behind him - the peak Ninth-Grade Saint Monarch Lianluoyu and the Half-Step Spiritual Beast Hexian.</p><p></p><p>Let them come and compete for the human emperor's inheritance of the Silver Fox Clan.</p><p></p><p>Perfect!</p><p></p><p>Tian Kuixing: "()!"</p><p></p><p>Thinking this, he quietly moved towards that direction while the guards were not paying attention.</p><p></p><p>On the other side, back in his own residence, Ye Xiao, who was preparing to meditate, was quite helpless.</p><p></p><p>He was unable to easily enter a meditative state.</p><p></p><p>Previously, when he was in the human realm, he had to eat a lot of star beast meat every day, and it had become a habit.</p><p></p><p>Not only that, but if he didn't eat it for a day, he would feel extremely uncomfortable. The only thing was that when he was on Earth, because the Shenzhen Tiger had come, the star beasts had not fled, so Ye Xiao had promised them that within a week, he would not make them offer their blood and flesh.</p><p></p><p>So, Ye Xiao had been nearly a week without eating anything with a strong vital energy.</p><p></p><p>Today, being entertained by Ning Yuhen, his craving for vital energy had been rekindled, and his teeth were itching a little.</p><p></p><p>And the best dish Ning Yuhen had served him was a Sixth-Grade Grand Ancestor Star Beast, while Ye Xiao's usual diet was at least Xiantian Seventh-Grade, a huge gap between the two.</p><p></p><p>This made him somewhat irritable and uncomfortable, unable to easily enter a meditative state.</p><p></p><p>This was not to say that his willpower was not strong enough.</p><p></p><p>If it were wartime, he definitely would not have such feelings.</p><p></p><p>But now, he was simply idle, and when people are idle and bored, their teeth will mysteriously start to ache.</p><p></p><p>Perhaps this is what ordinary people call "life is in motion".</p><p></p><p>"Forget it, I'll just endure it."</p><p></p><p>Ye Xiao sighed helplessly, telling himself that in a few days, after he had mastered the emperor's inheritance, he could directly return to Jianghai City and have a good feast to make up for it.</p><p></p><p>However, at this moment, his perception suddenly sensed an unusual aura.</p><p></p><p>"Wait a minute, what is this?"</p><p></p><p>Ye Xiao's eyes immediately lit up.</p><p></p><p>Wow, it really is a case of lacking something and then it comes. He even suspected that his luck was too overpowered. At this time, Tian Kuixing had already approached the two Silver Foxes.</p><p></p><p>Seeing their serious expressions as they stood guard, he licked the corner of his mouth.</p><p></p><p>"Indeed, the Silver Fox Clan is impressive. Even a small soldier is so striking. If it were the Silver Fox Queen, that would be heavenly. Someday when I rise up, I must have a good taste, so as not to waste this life."</p><p></p><p>But the main task comes first!</p><p></p><p>Thinking of this, he stomped his foot, and his body instantly transformed into a bolt of lightning, rushing towards the two Silver Fox Clan members.</p><p></p><p>His speed was extremely fast, like lightning, and in an instant, he had reached the two Silver Foxes.</p><p></p><p>His sharp fangs were already starting to open wide.</p><p></p><p>He had no doubt that his next move would instantly subdue the two Silver Foxes.</p><p></p><p>He was confident in this, because he was a Xiantian Seventh-Grade Saint Monarch! A cultivator of this strength was already far beyond the abilities of most ordinary star beasts.</p><p></p><p>But just as he was about to capture them, suddenly an unexpected thing happened.</p><p></p><p>His vision went black, and he...</p><p></p><p>Here is the full English translation of the Chinese excerpt:</p><p></p><p>It's all gone.</p><p></p><p>Tiankai Star: "?" What's going on? What happened?</p><p></p><p>Where am I now? Why is it pitch black around me? "Hello? Is anyone there?"</p><p></p><p>"Is there anyone? If there is, please respond to me."</p><p></p><p>"Don't play hide-and-seek with me! Come out quickly! As long as you come out, I promise I won't kill you."</p><p></p><p>However, no matter how he called out, there was nothing around him, it was still a scene of complete darkness.</p><p></p><p>Tiankai Star started to panic.</p><p></p><p>He wanted to try to break through this place because he felt the abnormality here.</p><p></p><p>But in this space, he had no way to start, he didn't even know where he was now? Outside, Ye Xiao was starting to roast something with a cheerful smile.</p><p></p><p>This guy, he is actually a yellow eel star beast.</p><p></p><p>Ye Xiao never thought that he had wanted to eat this for a long time, but he never had the chance to get it.</p><p></p><p>Unexpectedly, on the very first day of coming to the Silver Fox Clan, he encountered it.</p><p></p><p>Perfect!</p><p></p><p>Decapitate it, clean out the viscera, sprinkle some cumin, chili powder, salt, and coat it with oil.</p><p></p><p>Two words, amazing!</p><p></p><p>It seems that his luck is really good, he doesn't know if he will have luck tomorrow to get better prey?</p><p></p><p>Since he has come to the starry sky this time, he must hunt a few more times and eat more delicious things.</p><p></p><p>Otherwise, wouldn't that be a waste?</p><p></p><p>Under the starry sky, two Silver Fox Clan guards couldn't help but feel puzzled: "Little Red, have you smelled something that smells really fragrant somewhere?"</p><p></p><p>"It seems there is a very fragrant smell, a bit like the smell of roasted fish."</p><p></p><p>"I remember when I was little, Uncle Wang next door made roasted fish for me, and I loved to eat it the most. Whenever I asked him to make it, he would always make it for me."</p><p></p><p>"Wow, I'm so envious of you! I don't have as good a fate as you. I have several uncles, Second Uncle, Third Uncle, Fourth Uncle, Fifth Uncle, Sixth Uncle, Seventh Uncle, Eighth Uncle, Ninth Uncle, Tenth Uncle, Eleventh Uncle, but they only order me to do chores every time.</p><p></p><p>With so many paternal uncles, I'm still not as good as you having one neighbor uncle."</p><p></p><p>Time passed quickly. In the blink of an eye, it was the next day.</p><p></p><p>Since the Imperial Realm inheritance has not yet opened, Ye Xiao estimated that he would have to stay here for another two days.</p><p></p><p>However, since Ning Yuheng has already said that the Imperial Realm inheritance will open in the next few days, he doesn't need to be too anxious, he can just treat it as a vacation.</p><p></p><p>Early in the morning, Ning Yuheng had two Silver Fox Clan maids bring him a large pile of heavenly materials and earthly treasures.</p><p></p><p>It's clear that he is truly treating him as his close friend, like a good big brother.</p><p></p><p>He doesn't know Ye Xiao's cultivation level now, so he just stuffs all the good things at him.</p><p></p><p>Ye Xiao doesn't need to specifically say what his cultivation level is, that would make it seem like he's showing off.</p><p></p><p>When the time is right, he will naturally know.</p><p></p><p>Originally thought it would be another peaceful day, but as soon as the sun came out, the Silver Fox Valley welcomed several unusual guests.</p><p></p><p>They were all star beasts, and the most powerful ones were actually above the Innate Ninth Grade, including some at the peak of the Innate Ninth Grade, whose strength was already approaching that of a semi-divine beast.</p><p></p><p>Their identities seemed to be not low, and the Silver Fox Valley specially arranged a banquet to entertain them.</p><p></p><p>Ning Yuheng also specially invited him to go with him.</p><p></p><p>Although it is said that star beasts and human races are mortal enemies, that is in the case where the numbers on both sides are very large.</p><p></p><p>Occasionally, there is one human race among the star beasts, or one star beast among the human race, which is not a big deal.</p><p></p><p>At the banquet, Ye Xiao finally saw those few star beasts with relatively strong strength, and he had no interest in the other small fry.</p><p></p><p>Those few star beasts were respectively a female semi-divine crane, an Innate Ninth Grade leopard, an Innate Ninth Grade wolf demon, and an Innate Ninth Grade turtle.</p><p></p><p>But the one that Ye Xiao was most interested in was a rabbit at the peak of the Innate Ninth Grade, who had not yet stepped into the realm of the semi-divine beast.</p><p></p><p>The moment he saw her, Ye Xiao admitted that he swallowed a mouthful of saliva uncontrollably.</p><p></p><p>If he remembered correctly, he had seen this before in the Star Beast Records - this was a Brocade Jade Rabbit.</p><p></p><p>The Star Beast Records had said that the meat of this rabbit was extremely tender, tender to the point that you couldn't even imagine.</p><p></p><p>In fact, there was even a ranking list of the deliciousness of star beast meat in the Star Beast Records.</p><p></p><p>The Brocade Jade Rabbit ranked among the top.</p><p></p><p>Ye Xiao had always wanted to catch a Brocade Jade Rabbit to eat, but he had never had the chance.</p><p></p><p>Because in the human world, star beasts are not really that many, and the excellent varieties are even rarer.</p><p></p><p>Only in this starry sky can he find so many excellent varieties and top-notch star beasts.</p><p></p><p>Unexpectedly, he had just thought of catching a few more powerful star beasts yesterday, and today he encountered such a good item.</p><p></p><p>It's really a case of wishes coming true!

        <h1>Chapter 91</h1>
        <div class="content">
            <p>Here is the full English translation of the Chinese excerpt:</p><p></p><p>When Ye Xiao arrived at the fourth floor, he clearly felt that there was a layer of restriction in the library.</p><p></p><p>This kind of restriction was mostly in the form of formations.</p><p></p><p>The so-called formations were special energies generated by the operation of certain routes using specially refined ores.</p><p></p><p>These special energies had both offensive and defensive forms.</p><p></p><p>Regardless of the form, they could unleash tremendous power.</p><p></p><p>Formations were the protective umbrella for the high-level cultivation methods hidden in the major libraries, and they were the first line of defense.</p><p></p><p>Therefore, they were usually contracted and constructed by the top formation masters of the Nine Provinces Alliance.</p><p></p><p>This was also why Yang Zhengyi, although a Grand Master, was unable to easily steal the cultivation methods before.</p><p></p><p>However, Ye Xiao had the certificate issued by the librarian, so he could easily enter the fourth floor.</p><p></p><p>There were quite a few people on the fourth floor, even a bit more than expected.</p><p></p><p>There were probably one or two hundred people.</p><p></p><p>This number was definitely not enough compared to the lower floors, but each of these people had a cultivation base of at least post-Heavenly Fifth Grade, not including the post-Heavenly Fifth Grade.</p><p></p><p>In other words, these people were the pillars of Jianghai City. They were very likely to advance to the Patriarch realm in the next few decades.</p><p></p><p>When Ye Xiao arrived, many eyes fell on him. Seeing that he only revealed a post-Heavenly Second Grade cultivation base, they couldn't help but raise their eyebrows, with a hint of puzzlement.</p><p></p><p>It seemed they were wondering how a post-Heavenly Second Grade trash like him could have the qualifications to enter the fourth floor?</p><p></p><p>Ye Xiao didn't pay attention to the crowd and walked straight over to start searching for the books he wanted.</p><p></p><p>Surprisingly, there were indeed many surprises on the fourth floor.</p><p></p><p>As soon as Ye Xiao reached out to a bookshelf, his Golden Book spiritual consciousness violently pulsed.</p><p></p><p>This made him slightly startled, but then he quickly became delighted and reached out to take the book.</p><p></p><p>It was not a book on forging techniques, but a book on martial arts.</p><p></p><p>Ye Xiao had previously cultivated a few martial arts, but the basic techniques he found were limited to only two books.</p><p></p><p>Unexpectedly, he found a third one here.</p><p></p><p>He quickly studied it and imprinted it into his spiritual consciousness.</p><p></p><p>Then, he continued to search for books on forging techniques.</p><p></p><p>During this process, he occasionally came across other series of basic cultivation methods that the Golden Book had not yet recorded.</p><p></p><p>After cultivating the Taixuan Tiangong Spiritual Cultivation Method, Ye Xiao's mind had become very agile, like a computer.</p><p></p><p>So he could clearly discern that the drop rate here was much higher, probably 10 to 15 times that of the lower floors.</p><p></p><p>In other words, while it would take seeing 10,000 books to find a basic cultivation method on the lower floors, here he might only need to see 1,000 books.</p><p></p><p>Thinking about it, it made sense. The cultivation methods here were all of the extraordinary level, while the ones on the lower floors were mostly of the ordinary level.</p><p></p><p>The recording and copying of cultivation methods required the cultivator to have sufficient experience and a certain level of attainment.</p><p></p><p>For ordinary cultivation methods with low entry-level requirements, there were many people who could copy and modify them.</p><p></p><p>Even some post-Heavenly Third or Fourth Grade cultivators might be able to edit an ordinary-level cultivation method.</p><p></p><p>But for the extraordinary-level ones, only Patriarch-level or above masters could edit them.</p><p></p><p>This greatly reduced the number of cultivation methods available.</p><p></p><p>Unknowingly, it had eliminated a large portion of the useless books for Ye Xiao.</p><p></p><p>Although reading the extraordinary-level cultivation methods might be slightly slower than the ordinary ones, this difference was negligible for Ye Xiao, as his cultivation was already quite high. With just a bit of comprehension, he could grasp them quickly.</p><p></p><p>Here is the full English translation of the Chinese excerpt:</p><p></p><p>Quickly grasp it.</p><p></p><p>However, what Ye Xiao was mainly looking for was the art of forging weapons.</p><p></p><p>In half a day, he found about three more basic techniques of the art of forging weapons. With this, he now had the basic techniques of eight arts of forging weapons.</p><p></p><p>But the divine book's spiritual soul had not yet emitted a faint glow, so he didn't know how many more he needed to break through and fuse.</p><p></p><p>"Duang~!"</p><p></p><p>Soon, the closing bell of the library rang, and although Ye Xiao didn't work there today, when the library closed at night, he still had to leave.</p><p></p><p>After simply packing up his things, Ye Xiao followed the crowd and left the fourth floor.</p><p></p><p>With the certificate provided by the librarian, it seems he would be fortunate for the next month, being able to come to the fourth floor to read books from time to time.</p><p></p><p>How wonderful.</p><p></p><p>However, when Ye Xiao walked out of the fourth floor and came to the hall below, the sound of sirens came from the entrance.</p><p></p><p>Soon, several members of the defense team rushed in.</p><p></p><p>Ye Xiao couldn't help but raise his eyebrows slightly.</p><p></p><p>"What's going on?"</p><p></p><p>Gu Hai, in the crowd, glanced at him and quietly walked up to remind him.</p><p></p><p>"Old Ye, quickly leave, your library has detected the fluctuation of a star beast."</p><p></p><p>Ye Xiao was slightly stunned. The library had the fluctuation of a star beast? </p><p></p><p>How come he didn't feel it at all?</p><p></p><p>Suddenly, a silver-white fox figure suddenly rushed out from upstairs.</p><p></p><p>"There it is! It's over there!"</p><p></p><p>"Quick! Catch it!"</p><p></p><p>The entire library instantly descended into chaos.</p><p></p><p>People frantically rushed out, while the defense team members frantically chased after the fox.</p><p></p><p>The silver-white fox swept its gaze across the crowd, its eyes filled with pain and sorrow.</p><p></p><p>Even a few tears welled up in its beady little eyes.</p><p></p><p>But the moment its eyes met Ye Xiao's gaze, it suddenly shrank back, then immediately jumped away.</p><p></p><p>Its gaze became panicked and self-reproaching.</p><p></p><p>As if it didn't want Ye Xiao to see it in this state at all.</p><p></p><p>But Ye Xiao understood.</p><p></p><p>That was not a star beast, that was Ning Yushen! Ning Yushen was a member of the silver fox clan, and the last time Aier's soul was attached to his body, it had done something to gradually activate his silver fox star beast bloodline.</p><p></p><p>Once a human's star beast bloodline is activated, it is very likely to devour the human bloodline and turn into a star beast.</p><p></p><p>This is also why all the countries in the world are so wary of beastmen, because no one knows when they will become unstable and undergo a huge transformation for some reason.</p><p></p><p>But didn't Ye Xiao use a healing technique to suppress Ning Yushen's silver fox bloodline at the time? Why did it become ineffective?</p><p></p><p>At the time, he had thoroughly searched with his spiritual power, and Aier's soul had left no spiritual imprint, so it couldn't have changed Ning Yushen again.</p><p></p><p>At this time, the commotion in the library had gradually subsided, leaving only some aftereffects.</p><p></p><p>The defense team members had all chased after the direction Ning Yushen had fled.</p><p></p><p>Ye Xiao could guess with his little toe that if Ning Yushen was caught, the outcome would not be good.</p><p></p><p>After a brief thought, Ye Xiao followed the crowd and left the library.</p><p></p><p>It's the third watch, thank you fellow reader Sheng Shi Xiao Zu for the reward, I'm deeply grateful.</p><p></p><p>I'm working on the draft, and there will be a burst of updates later.</p><p></p><p>(This chapter ends)</p>

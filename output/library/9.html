        <h1>Chapter 9</h1>
        <div class="content">
            <p>Here is the full English translation of the Chinese excerpt:</p><p></p><p>Especially in the center of Jianghai City, the situation was the most severe.</p><p></p><p>A three-meter-tall, muscular, insect-like humanoid monster was sitting calmly by the fountain in the central square of Jianghai City, holding a delicate human arm in its hand, just like holding a chicken wing.</p><p></p><p>Agonizing screams were constantly coming from the surrounding buildings.</p><p></p><p>Those were Supernal Realm star beasts, capturing and devouring human cultivators.</p><p></p><p>It was said that for humans to devour star beasts, they must refine the star core and flesh into elixirs, directly consuming the star beasts' cores and flesh. This could potentially lead to being infected and transformed into a star beast themselves! As for the star beasts, they could directly enhance their own power by devouring humans.</p><p></p><p>This was the reason for the mutual targeting between the two sides.</p><p></p><p>In simple terms, they both viewed the other as their own resources.</p><p></p><p>However, at this moment, a sudden sword beam shot over from the distance, directly piercing through the head of a Supernal Realm star beast, leaving no trace.</p><p></p><p>Boom! Accompanied by an explosive sound, the sword beam finally landed ten meters in front of the insect-like monster, blasting the ground and sending up a cloud of smoke.</p><p></p><p>The insect-like star beast monster threw the half-eaten arm it was holding to the ground, spitting out a mouthful of blood, and surprisingly spoke in human language.</p><p></p><p>"How annoying, can't even have a meal in peace."</p><p></p><p>After reaching the Patriarch Realm, the star beasts' power, size, and intelligence would gradually increase, and they might even develop the ability to speak human language.</p><p></p><p>As the dust settled, an elder in Tang-style clothing, carrying a long sword on his back, slowly approached.</p><p></p><p>Although his hair and beard were completely white, his spirit was vigorous, his complexion ruddy, and his eyes shining, exuding an immortal aura.</p><p></p><p>The people in the surrounding buildings recognized his identity and shouted loudly:</p><p></p><p>"That's Principal Qin Shenglong of the Jianghai Martial Arts Academy!"</p><p></p><p>"A Patriarch Realm expert! A Patriarch Realm expert has arrived!"</p><p></p><p>"We're saved now."</p><p></p><p>The excited people cheered, and the Patriarch Realm star beast also stood up from the fountain, with a flame of excitement flickering in its eyes.</p><p></p><p>"Qin Shenglong! Thirty years! It's been thirty whole years! Do you know how I've been living these past thirty years?"</p><p></p><p>Qin Shenglong walked forward with his hands behind his back, his gaze fixed on the star beast Patriarch.</p><p></p><p>"You shouldn't have come out. If you had stayed obediently in prison, you might have lived a few more years."</p><p></p><p>"Hahaha..."</p><p></p><p>After a loud, manic laugh, the star beast Patriarch's eyes turned completely cold.</p><p></p><p>"Old dog Qin, let me give you a human saying. Thirty years on the east bank, thirty years on the west!"</p><p></p><p>Saying this, he stomped his foot and suddenly burst forth with tremendous force, like a cannonball, appearing in front of Qin Shenglong in an instant.</p><p></p><p>Qin Shenglong shook his head.</p><p></p><p>"You overestimate yourself."</p><p></p><p>As he spoke, he swiftly drew his sword, and the powerful Patriarch Realm energy surged into the blade like crashing waves.</p><p></p><p>The moment the star beast Patriarch reached Qin Shenglong, the latter's sword came crashing down on the Patriarch's head.</p><p></p><p>In an instant, a dazzling light filled the entire square, forcing both humans and star beasts to involuntarily close their eyes.</p><p></p><p>Boom! The next second, a massive explosion and powerful tremors shook the ground, causing the surrounding high-rise buildings to tremble.</p><p></p><p>The tremendous power excited and thrilled the humans in the buildings.</p><p></p><p>This was the power of a Patriarch Realm expert! Using a mortal body to unleash earth-shattering divine might! Many clenched their fists, shouting excitedly in their hearts.</p><p></p><p>Patriarch!</p><p></p><p>Here is the full English translation of the Chinese excerpt:</p><p></p><p>Oil!</p><p></p><p>But just a moment later, when the light disappeared and everyone opened their eyes again, the smiles on their faces were inevitably suppressed.</p><p></p><p>"How is this possible?"</p><p></p><p>On the square, the Star Beast Master, with a single arm, actually managed to block Qin Shenglong's long sword.</p><p></p><p>Unharmed!</p><p></p><p>Qin Shenglong's face also suddenly changed.</p><p></p><p>"Didn't expect that, did you, old dog Qin? All of this is thanks to the gift of humanity, integrating the genes of the Star Beasts, allowing me to evolve an impenetrable armor. Among the humans, there is no great sect that has the power to break through my armor."</p><p></p><p>A sinister smile appeared on the Star Beast Master's face, and then he unleashed a powerful punch.</p><p></p><p>"Not good!"</p><p></p><p>Qin Shenglong's expression changed, and he immediately tried to retreat, but it was too late.</p><p></p><p>Boom! Another deafening explosion, and Qin Shenglong was directly punched away by the opponent.</p><p></p><p>Midair, he spat out a mouthful of fresh blood, and before he could land, another figure suddenly shot out, trying to catch him.</p><p></p><p>"Don't touch me, my ribs are broken."</p><p></p><p>Qin Shenglong avoided the other person and used his own techniques to dissipate the force, landing several steps away, each step leaving a footprint over 20 centimeters deep on the hard cement ground, shocking to the eye!</p><p></p><p>The figure that came to his aid was none other than the librarian, Ouyang Yunzhong.</p><p></p><p>"Old Qin, are you alright?"</p><p></p><p>Qin Shenglong's face was grave as he said:</p><p></p><p>"I'm not dead yet. But I can't defeat this guy. Not only me, even the entire Jianghai City would be wiped out!"</p><p></p><p>"Nangong Ling is suppressing the prison, I've already notified the higher-ups, and they should send experts over soon. Hold on."</p><p></p><p>"You have no chance!"</p><p></p><p>As he spoke, the Star Beast Master attacked again.</p><p></p><p>The intelligence of the high-level Star Beasts is no less than that of humans, and they would not give Qin Shenglong and the other two the slightest chance.</p><p></p><p>The two human masters were forced to fight again, but unable to break through the opponent's defenses, they were suppressed and could barely hold their ground, being pushed back repeatedly, only able to rely on teamwork and the surrounding buildings to slow down the opponent's offensive.</p><p></p><p>The Star Beast Master attacked furiously, his iron fists each time exerting a force of over a thousand jin, able to create a large crater in the ground! The street echoed with one explosion after another, and the surrounding buildings were humming and trembling.</p><p></p><p>The humans hiding in the buildings huddled together, trembling in fear.</p><p></p><p>The two powerful masters working together could not subdue the Star Beast Master, a despair no less than the end of the world!</p><p></p><p>At this moment, accompanied by a gust of clean wind, a figure finally arrived near the library.</p><p></p><p>"Finally back."</p><p></p><p>Seeing the library, Ye Xiao's heart finally calmed down a bit.</p><p></p><p>But before he could settle down, a series of violent explosions came from the distant street, getting closer and closer!</p><p></p><p>Ye Xiao glanced around and couldn't help but frown slightly.</p><p></p><p>"Such a powerful Star Beast. If this continues, those two human masters might not be able to hold on. The small Star Beasts' defense team will intervene, but this one... I'm afraid many people will die."</p><p></p><p>After a moment of contemplation, Ye Xiao casually plucked a green leaf from a nearby flower bed.</p><p></p><p>Infusing the powerful aura of the master-level Tyrant Sword Dao into the leaf, it began to emit a dazzling golden glow!</p><p></p><p>"Go!"</p><p></p><p>With a flick of his finger, the green leaf transformed into a golden lightning bolt and shot out.</p><p></p><p>(End of this chapter)</p>

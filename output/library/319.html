        <h1>Chapter 319</h1>
        <div class="content">
            <p>Here is the full English translation of the Chinese excerpt:</p><p></p><p>"This time the Star Beasts have twenty-one super divine beings. The one I just slew was only one of the weaker ones.</p><p></p><p>There are still veteran super divine beings behind them, who have already stepped into the super divine realm for many years, and their strength is far superior to his."</p><p></p><p>Jiang Chen and the two others nodded.</p><p></p><p>"You're right, we still can't let our guard down."</p><p></p><p>"Alright, I'll go repair all the formations in the Central State first, you two go gather intelligence from the other states and see how serious the situation is?"</p><p></p><p>"Okay!"</p><p></p><p>The three split up, and Ye Xiao quickly repaired all the formations in the Central State.</p><p></p><p>After he finished, the three met up again, and Jiang Chen and Senior Beitang Ce's expressions were quite grave.</p><p></p><p>Seeing their expressions, Ye Xiao could already guess that the news was not good.</p><p></p><p>If it weren't for the fact that the two were his good friends and seniors, Ye Xiao might have been tempted to scan their memories with spiritual power.</p><p></p><p>"Senior, what has happened?"</p><p></p><p>Beitang Ce took a deep breath, looked at the Venerable Xuanwu, and spoke again:</p><p></p><p>"You tell him."</p><p></p><p>Jiang Chen nodded, took a deep breath.</p><p></p><p>"Two and a half hours ago, the Western State fell completely and was utterly destroyed."</p><p></p><p>"Two hours ago, the Australian and British states fell in succession, completely destroyed."</p><p></p><p>"An hour and a half ago, the Yingzhou State fell, completely destroyed."</p><p></p><p>"As of half an hour ago, we can no longer receive signals from the other states. If nothing unexpected happens, they should have all fallen and been occupied by the Star Beasts.</p><p></p><p>To put it bluntly, apart from our Nine States, there are no more human races left in this world."</p><p></p><p>Ye Xiao couldn't help but be shocked.</p><p></p><p>He had expected this calamity of the beasts to be severe, but he didn't expect it to be this serious.</p><p></p><p>To have wiped out the vast majority of the human race in one fell swoop.</p><p></p><p>It seems these Star Beasts have quite an appetite.</p><p></p><p>Or rather, the divine race behind them has a big appetite.</p><p></p><p>With so many human races, who knows how much divine blood they can refine.</p><p></p><p>It seems they will soon cultivate many more super divine Star Beasts.</p><p></p><p>"Ye Xiao, there are still many remnant human forces outside the Nine States calling for our help. What do you think we should do?"</p><p></p><p>Ye Xiao shook his head.</p><p></p><p>"Ignore them."</p><p></p><p>Ridiculous, with Star Beasts everywhere outside, how many people would have to die to save them? And these barbarians, each and every one of them is treacherous and ungrateful.</p><p></p><p>When they need you, they'll put you on a high pedestal and shower you with praise and flattery.</p><p></p><p>When they don't need you, stabbing you in the back is normal, and if there's a conflict of interest, they might even try to bite you to death.</p><p></p><p>And now, being besieged by the Star Beasts, they must be lowering their posture to beg for help. If we save them, they'll probably add all kinds of demands.</p><p></p><p>Today they want an air-conditioned room, tomorrow a small villa, the day after a famous tutor, and the day after that they'll want some immortal elixir.</p><p></p><p>What's the point of saving these troublemakers? Only an idiot would save them!</p><p></p><p>Before, to prevent them from falling into the hands of the Star Beasts and having their divine blood refined, we even notified them about the arrival of the Star Beasts, but they didn't care at all, and even had all kinds of malicious speculations.</p><p></p><p>Human greed is insatiable, and human hearts are the hardest to fill.</p><p></p><p>"Right now, we have more important things to do.</p><p></p><p>The strength of the Star Beasts will increase again, and it won't be long before they launch a larger-scale assault on the Nine States.</p><p></p><p>Even this wave of attacks without any super divine beings has already been very difficult for the Nine States, if they refine divine blood and launch another attack, the Nine States may truly not be able to hold on.</p><p></p><p>So the Nine States need stronger power."</p><p></p><p>Jiang Chen and the others nodded.</p><p></p><p>Ye Xiao was right, the Nine States are now facing the greatest crisis in history.</p><p></p><p>Although Ye Xiao's strength is very strong, he cannot instantly annihilate all these Star Beasts, and while he is fighting, if these Star Beasts break through the imperial formations, they will bring devastating strikes to the human race of the Nine States.</p><p></p><p>The Venerable Xuanwu pondered for a moment.</p><p></p><p>"The places that can currently bring power to the Nine States have basically all disappeared. You've been to the Long White Dragon Vein, and obtained a lot of inheritance, if you go there again, you might end up destroying the Long White Dragon Vein. That is the last dragon vein in the Nine States."</p><p></p><p>Ye Xiao nodded.</p><p></p><p>"Of course we can't destroy the dragon vein, Senior. Doesn't the Nine States have any trump cards that have been passed down for thousands of years?"</p><p></p><p>"The dragon vein..."</p><p></p><p>Beitang Ce murmured.</p><p></p><p>"If only the Nine States still had the dragon vein. According to legend, the Ancestor Dragon seized the Nine Tripods of the Great Zhou, and divided the dragon qi within them to suppress and condense into dragon veins throughout the Nine States.</p><p></p><p>He used this dragon vein to forge a Great Wall Formation that could thoroughly protect the entire Nine States."</p><p></p><p>The Venerable Xuanwu seemed to have thought of something and spoke again:</p><p></p><p>"Speaking of this, I do have a little idea. Although we don't know how to solve the current predicament of the Nine States, that doesn't mean others don't know."</p><p></p><p>"What does the Venerable mean?"</p><p></p><p>Beitang Ce was a bit puzzled, but Jiang Chen's gaze was firm and full of reverence:</p><p></p><p>Here is the full English translation of the Chinese excerpt:</p><p></p><p>"The Imperial Spirit Stele."</p><p></p><p>Hearing this term, Beitang Ce's body immediately trembled, and an expression of profound reverence appeared on his face.</p><p></p><p>"The Imperial Spirit Stele!"</p><p></p><p>"What is that place?" Ye Xiao asked, somewhat puzzled.</p><p></p><p>This was the first time he had heard this term.</p><p></p><p>Beitang Ce took a deep breath and explained:</p><p></p><p>"The Imperial Spirit Stele, as the name suggests, is the place where the powerful experts of the Imperial Realm are buried. There, all the powerful experts of the Imperial Realm and the Emperors from the Han Dynasty onwards are interred, and their spirits still linger there."</p><p></p><p>Ye Xiao's mind stirred.</p><p></p><p>"There is actually such a place."</p><p></p><p>"That's right. The Imperial Spirit Stele is the tomb of the powerful experts of the Imperial Realm throughout history, and it also contains a vast amount of rare treasures. Perhaps there, you may find some opportunities."</p><p></p><p>"Ye Xiao, at the moment, you and the Azure Dragon are the only ones in the Imperial Realm, but the Azure Dragon is stationed at the Long White Dragon Vein, so you are the closest to the Imperial Spirit Stele. You should go and try your luck there."</p><p></p><p>Xuanwu spoke up and persuaded, and Ye Xiao nodded.</p><p></p><p>"Where is the entrance to the Imperial Spirit Stele?"</p><p></p><p>"Mount Tai!"</p><p></p><p>"If that's the case, then I shall go there. You two, place all the Spirit Energy Cannons obtained from the Spirit Energy Ship on the ground. If any Star Beasts come again, you can use the Spirit Energy Cannons to hold them off for a while."</p><p></p><p>"Alright!"</p><p></p><p>Ye Xiao bid farewell to the two and used the Yin-Yang Escape Technique to instantly arrive at the foot of Mount Tai.</p><p></p><p>Within the majestic Mount Tai, there were already many Star Beasts roaming the wilderness, hunting for prey.</p><p></p><p>Among the nine major regions of the Nine Provinces, Mount Tai was not included, and many other places that were not protected by formations were also being invaded by wandering Star Beasts.</p><p></p><p>Some of them had fallen from the Star Battlefield, while others had been hiding in various parts of the Nine Provinces, and now they were emerging arrogantly while the human tribes were gathered in the five major regions.</p><p></p><p>Seeing Ye Xiao approach, the numerous Star Beasts immediately charged towards him.</p><p></p><p>"Roar!"</p><p></p><p>With a low growl, Ye Xiao activated the Imperial Art-level Decree - Tiger Roar of the Mountain Forest, instantly blasting the charging Star Beasts into a mist of blood.</p><p></p><p>Ye Xiao activated the Plucking Star Hand, gathering them together and directly refining them into a medicinal pill.</p><p></p><p>Although these Star Beasts were not top-tier, when combined, they provided a substantial amount of vital energy, and the Star Beasts scattered across the mountains and forests were enough to refine a powerful Imperial Pill.</p><p></p><p>Rumble... Thunder erupted in the sky above, and the Heavenly Tribulation of the Imperial Pill was about to descend.</p><p></p><p>Ye Xiao glanced up at the sky and calmly uttered a single word.</p><p></p><p>"Begone!"</p><p></p><p>With that simple statement, the vast thunderclouds gradually retreated.</p><p></p><p>This Heavenly Tribulation was only the Tribulation of the Imperial Pill, not a particularly powerful one, so it did not dare to provoke Ye Xiao, an expert in the Imperial Realm.</p><p></p><p>Heavenly Tribulations were selective in their targets.</p><p></p><p>They would attack if they could win, but retreat if they couldn't.</p><p></p><p>Since Ye Xiao's main goal was to find the Imperial Spirit Stele, he did not have time to let the Heavenly Tribulation refine the medicinal pill. Moreover, as an expert in the Imperial Realm, he could use the Myriad Elements Returning to One technique to refine the impurities in the pill without the need for the Heavenly Tribulation.</p><p></p><p>Ye Xiao casually tossed the Imperial Pill into his mouth like a sugar bean and then activated the Grand Heavenly Tribulation to search for the Imperial Spirit Stele.</p><p></p><p>Soon, he found the Imperial Spirit Stele at the peak of Mount Tai.</p><p></p><p>The Imperial Spirit Stele was a massive stone stele, forged from a special material. At first glance, it appeared to be made of stone, extremely hard and durable, but it was actually a layer of concentrated spiritual energy that had solidified into a jade-like stone stele, and over the years of weathering, it had taken on the appearance of an ordinary stone stele.</p><p></p><p>However, its interior was filled with pure and potent spiritual blood.</p><p></p><p>Ye Xiao teleported to the front of the Imperial Spirit Stele, sat down with his legs crossed, and merged his spiritual power into the stele, intending to communicate with the spirits of the past Emperors and experts of the Imperial Realm.</p><p></p><p>Meanwhile, in the depths of the Star Realm, a figure stood tall, staring intently in the direction of the human world.</p><p></p><p>Dressed in a black robe, his face was shrouded in shadow, but his eyes emitted a faint blue glow, as if they could pierce through millions of miles and instantly reach the human world.</p><p></p><p>After a moment, a figure flashed by his side, a powerful divine beast. It transformed into a human form and knelt before the shadowy figure.</p><p></p><p>"Greetings, Young Master. Your humble servant pays respects to the Young Master and wishes you well."</p><p></p><p>The shadowy figure remained silent for a long time before speaking.</p><p></p><p>"How is the plan progressing?"</p><p></p><p>"My lord, the descendants of the Winged Deity Clan, the Giant Ape Deity Clan, and the Brahma Deity Clan have all been captured. Some of the descendants of the Xuanyuan Clan have also been captured, but the majority of the Xuanyuan Clan descendants are still hiding in the Nine Provinces of the human world and have not been captured."</p><p></p><p>A hint of chill emanated from the shadowy figure, indicating his displeasure.</p><p></p><p>"I have said that the most important ones are the descendants of the Xuanuan Clan. The divine blood of the Xuanuan Clan is far more valuable than the others. Why have you not captured them first?"</p>

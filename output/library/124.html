        <h1>Chapter 124</h1>
        <div class="content">
            <p>Here is the full English translation of the Chinese excerpt:</p><p></p><p>Today's class was only held for about half a day. In the afternoon, when it was time to go to work, the director of the library, Ouyang, gathered all the library staff and began the meeting.</p><p></p><p>"The reason I've called everyone here today is to talk about the matter of the Seven Star Constellation. </p><p></p><p>As we all know, when the Seven Star Constellation arrives, the star beasts will cause unrest. The confirmed dates are around the middle of the 10th month, for a period of about 7 days.</p><p></p><p>During these 7 days, the entire Jianghai City will be in an unsafe state.</p><p></p><p>So, according to the previous defense tasks, the City Lord's Manor requires all unit personnel not to return home, but to gather and assemble near the buildings capable of resisting the star beasts.</p><p></p><p>All members of our library must stay in the dormitories.</p><p></p><p>Those with family members can also bring them over, and they can only leave the library when the lockdown is lifted."</p><p></p><p>Humans have reinforced the city's buildings to resist the invasion of the star beasts, making their defensive capabilities much stronger than Ye Xiao's previous life.</p><p></p><p>But there is still a limit to this.</p><p></p><p>In order to prevent the buildings from being destroyed by the star beasts and to avoid large-scale human exposure as targets, certain specific buildings are needed to provide refuge for humans in times of crisis.</p><p></p><p>Places like schools, libraries, and large employment companies have building materials that are several levels denser.</p><p></p><p>In addition, there are also defensive formations guarding these places, making it difficult for the star beasts to attack. The martial artists responsible for the battle will be arranged on the outskirts of the city and on the inner city roads to fight the star beasts.</p><p></p><p>This can minimize human casualties as much as possible.</p><p></p><p>As for the ordinary buildings, although they may be damaged, there is no need to worry too much. The state will provide compensation.</p><p></p><p>After the meeting, the afternoon was given a half-day off, allowing employees some time to move their especially valuable belongings, such as weapons, armor, and rare materials, to the library in advance, to prevent excessive economic losses.</p><p></p><p>Ye Xiao didn't care, as he could directly use his storage ring to store his entire courtyard.</p><p></p><p>And he was a bachelor without a girlfriend, so he could move into the library dormitory alone without worrying about his family.</p><p></p><p>So while others were busy finding their families and moving things, Ye Xiao was still reading books in the library.</p><p></p><p>Two more days passed, and finally, there was news from Huan Liuli.</p><p></p><p>It was a message transmitted through spiritual power.</p><p></p><p>Huan Liuli was from the Illusion Panther clan, specialized in spiritual power, and had the ability to transmit information through spiritual power effortlessly.</p><p></p><p>Spiritual power messages can be transmitted directionally through the air, and then searched for the target, automatically attaching to it when encountered. Moreover, they are encrypted, and only extremely powerful spiritual cultivators can decipher them, with forceful decryption leading to the destruction of the information.</p><p></p><p>After receiving the message, Ye Xiao directly used the Taixuan Tiangong to decrypt it.</p><p></p><p>"Master, master, I've found out that these star beasts actually have a big plan. They've set up transmission star traces in storage rings, and then sold the storage rings to various human cities. When the Seven Star Constellation arrives, they'll directly teleport the star beasts over."</p><p></p><p>Ye Xiao was stunned, obviously not expecting the star beasts to have such means.</p><p></p><p>It seems the star beasts' intelligence is quite high.</p><p></p><p>The strategist star beasts are planning online? The human side wanted to clear out some star beasts before the Seven Star Constellation, thinking they'd have fewer to deal with on that day, but the star beasts have changed their strategy.</p><p></p><p>Using spatial storage rings to hide their transmission formations, and then teleporting the star beasts over when the Seven Star Constellation arrives.</p><p></p><p>This way, all the defense preparations made by the human side would be useless.</p><p></p><p>However, Ye Xiao wasn't sure about the exact numbers and strengths of the enemy.</p><p></p><p>If their numbers are not many and their cultivation is not strong, there's no need to be too anxious. </p><p></p><p>But if they have large numbers and powerful experts, that would require more attention.</p><p></p><p>Ye Xiao is not a saint, but if the enemy poses too great a threat to Jianghai City, such as massacring hundreds of thousands of human martial artists and severely crippling Jianghai City, he would not want to see that.</p><p></p><p>Not to mention he is ultimately part of the human race himself.</p><p></p><p>Who could bear to see their own kind being slaughtered by other races, like killing chickens and dogs? Even just the massive human losses and the star beasts' growing strength could lead the human race to the brink of extinction.</p><p></p><p>Here is the full English translation of the Chinese excerpt:</p><p></p><p>He wouldn't fare any better either.</p><p></p><p>He still understood the principle of "when the lips are gone, the teeth will feel the cold."</p><p></p><p>Moreover, if he could exterminate so many star beasts, he would surely obtain a lot of fresh blood. In that case, wouldn't Little Aer be able to come out soon?</p><p></p><p>Ye Xiao had been craving it for a long time.</p><p></p><p>Thinking of this, Ye Xiao sent another encrypted spiritual message according to the coordinates transmitted by the spiritual power.</p><p></p><p>The gist of it was to ask Illusion Emerald to thoroughly investigate how many enemies there were and how many experts they had. After completing this task, he would reward her with a spirit pill.</p><p></p><p>As for him, he used the Taixuan Tiangong to sweep and found that spatial storage ring.</p><p></p><p>It was kept in a safe by the wealthy man who had bought it, and protective formations were set up around it.</p><p></p><p>This made Ye Xiao quite speechless.</p><p></p><p>These rich people, when buying a luxury item, really treat it like their own child to be taken care of.</p><p></p><p>The cost of that safe was probably not less than a hundred million.</p><p></p><p>You bought it, so just take it with you. At least when someone sees it, they'll say, "Wow! He's wearing a storage ring!"</p><p></p><p>The meaning of buying it is just to show off, right? What's the point of buying it if not to show off?</p><p></p><p>Ye Xiao didn't bother communicating with him. He knew the rich man wouldn't give it to him even if he asked, so he directly used the divine will technique to teleport over and directly take the ring.</p><p></p><p>That wealthy man probably just bought it to keep it in the safe and treasure it like a precious jewel. He didn't even check on it afterward, because Ye Xiao didn't see any alarm being raised.</p><p></p><p>In the following days, Ye Xiao spent time in the library, waiting for Illusion Emerald's news.</p><p></p><p>The master and servant had been communicating through spiritual power since they made contact.</p><p></p><p>On the first day:</p><p>"Hey, Master, I've successfully infiltrated their inner circle and am collecting information. Master, you said you'd give me a spirit pill. What kind of spirit pill is it? Is it a Patriarch-level pill?"</p><p>Ye Xiao replied: "Yes!"</p><p></p><p>On the fifth day:</p><p>"Hey, Master. I've even become a squad leader of theirs. They have a total of seven major squads, responsible for the Jianghai City and several surrounding cities. Each major squad has around 20,000 star beasts! They are divided into more than 140 smaller squads.</p><p>However, they seem to be starting to suspect me. Please come and rescue me quickly."</p><p></p><p>Ye Xiao: "Keep investigating, how many experts do they have? How many Patriarchs, Grand Patriarchs, and Saint Patriarchs?"</p><p></p><p>On the tenth day:</p><p>"Hey, Master, I've finally managed to deceive them. I've now found out that each squad leader is at the Innate First-Grade realm.</p><p>They have more than ten Innate Second-Grade middle squad leaders, and each major squad leader is at the Innate Third-Grade realm.</p><p>There's also a Saint Emissary, at the Innate Fifth-Grade realm! Please come quickly, they want to make me a middle squad leader to lead an attack on Jianghai City!"</p><p></p><p>Ye Xiao: "Keep investigating, are there any Saint Patriarchs?"</p><p></p><p>But in the following days, Illusion Emerald lost contact and seemed to have vanished without a trace.</p><p></p><p>This left Ye Xiao feeling puzzled and doubtful.</p><p></p><p>Meanwhile, the Seven Stars Converge was about to arrive in a day, and Ye Xiao could already see seven connected stars in the sky during the day.</p><p></p><p>The entire Jianghai City had entered a serious state, with everyone on the streets fully armed.</p><p></p><p>Could it be that Illusion Emerald had lost control of her bloodline and gone berserk, betraying him? Or had she been eliminated?</p><p></p><p>Filled with great doubt, Ye Xiao couldn't help but actively send a spiritual message for the first time.</p><p></p><p>"Illusion Emerald, have you found out anything?"</p><p></p><p>To his surprise, Illusion Emerald responded quickly.</p><p></p><p>"Find out what?"</p><p></p><p>"The number and strength of the star beasts!"</p><p></p><p>"Hehe, Mr. Ye, I am a star beast myself. Do you really think I would tell you the secrets of the star beasts? Just wait to receive our punishment!"</p><p></p><p>Ye Xiao: "(_..)!"</p><p></p><p>Something seemed to be off. Illusion Emerald's mind had been implanted with his spiritual power, and although she was silly, she wouldn't dare to openly defy him to this extent, as he could kill her with a single thought.</p><p></p><p>Could it be...</p><p></p><p>(This chapter ends)</p>

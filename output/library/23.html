        <h1>Chapter 23</h1>
        <div class="content">
            <p>Here is the full English translation of the Chinese excerpt:</p><p></p><p>He never imagined that a 20-year-old young man, who was no different from a cotton doll in his eyes, could split him in half with a single sword strike, allowing him to see the other half of his own face.</p><p></p><p>The elegance of that sword strike was more magnificent than a shooting star in the sky, overwhelmingly powerful! With a single blow, it destroyed his decades of arduous cultivation in an instant.</p><p></p><p>"Why did I have to provoke him?"</p><p></p><p>This was the last thought of the evil spirit's consciousness before it was completely dispersed.</p><p></p><p>No one on the entire street noticed this, because the evil spirit was a spiritual being, and ordinary people could not see it unless their spiritual cultivation reached a certain level.</p><p></p><p>Only the soul that had had its arm devoured by the evil spirit knelt down and kowtowed towards the retreating figure of Ye Xiao.</p><p></p><p>And on the belly of the yellow ox behind him, there was now a black hole about two fingers long.</p><p></p><p>When Ye Xiao arrived at the library, his colleagues were enthusiastically discussing something.</p><p></p><p>"Have you heard? Recently, a sword art genius from Hanzhou is coming to challenge the sword art disciples of the younger generation in our Nine States."</p><p></p><p>"Who doesn't know about it? The forum is almost exploding. That guy is called Park Jian-sheng, and he is the disciple of the sword saint Liu Cheng-xun from Hanzhou."</p><p></p><p>"Whew! He's actually Liu Cheng-xun's disciple? I heard that he is the number one swordsman in Hanzhou in the past hundred years! His sword skills can rank among the top ten in the world of sword art!"</p><p></p><p>"His overall combat power can even rank 47th on the Dragon Ranking in the world!"</p><p></p><p>"The disciple he taught is quite remarkable. I heard that the geniuses from Jingzhou have all been defeated. Our Jianghai City is the second stop of his challenge to the Nine States, and it is the gateway for the Central States to face Jingzhou. He may not be a friendly visitor."</p><p></p><p>"If the geniuses from Jingzhou have all been defeated, then there's an 80% chance that we in Jianghai City won't be able to withstand him."</p><p></p><p>Ye Xiao heard this and his expression changed slightly.</p><p></p><p>The sword art geniuses of the younger generation in Jingzhou had actually all been defeated. It seems that this Park Jian-sheng is indeed extraordinary.</p><p></p><p>Thinking about it carefully, it's not surprising. His teacher, Liu Cheng-xun, is at least one of the top ten swordsmen in the world, and his overall combat power can even rank on the Dragon Ranking. It's not unexpected that he would cultivate such a high-level disciple.</p><p></p><p>Ye Xiao often read books and had some understanding of the rankings in this world.</p><p></p><p>There was a Dragon Ranking and a Tiger Ranking in this world, which recorded the top 100 non-frontline warriors. The top 50 were called the Dragon Ranking, and the next 50 were called the Tiger Ranking. And there seemed to be a Phoenix Ranking specifically for recording the cultivation of female warriors! In any case, those who could be ranked were all extraordinary individuals! After all, to stand out from billions of people worldwide was a testament to their immense strength!</p><p></p><p>But what did this have to do with him? He was just a small administrator.</p><p></p><p>Clocking in for work, eating dinner, and sleeping at night - that was it.</p><p></p><p>Arriving upstairs, Ye Xiao began to read books again.</p><p></p><p>The knife techniques, sword techniques, and mental cultivation methods had now been integrated into top-tier cultivation methods, which were self-cultivated by the Divine Soul Scripture.</p><p></p><p>Next, he should consider learning some new skills, and also cultivate his spiritual power, so that he could successfully integrate more cultivation methods.</p><p></p><p>In the morning, Ye Xiao was reading a book when, accompanied by the fragrance of gardenia, Qin Yu-yan's gaze met his.</p><p></p><p>"Excuse me, I've come to return a book."</p><p></p><p>Ye Xiao nodded and took the book to check it.</p><p></p><p>"Everything's fine, I'll upload it later."</p><p></p><p>"Okay, thanks. Also, I have some things to take care of these two days, so I won't be able to come. If the library gets any new knife techniques, could you please keep an eye out for me?"</p><p></p><p>Ye Xiao nodded.</p><p></p><p>Here is the full English translation of the Chinese excerpt:</p><p></p><p>Head.</p><p></p><p>With his brilliant mind, he almost immediately realized what Qin Yuyan was going to do.</p><p></p><p>Her grandfather was the most renowned swordsman in Jianghai City, and she was also the one with the deepest swordsmanship among the younger generation.</p><p></p><p>Park Jiansheng came to Jianghai to challenge, and she must be Park Jiansheng's opponent! However, if she went up, it was estimated that she would most likely be defeated.</p><p></p><p>Although Ye Xiao had never seen Park Jiansheng, he also knew that Park Jiansheng's swordsmanship was absolutely extraordinary, otherwise he could not have swept away all the young swordsmen in Jingzhou.</p><p></p><p>Qin Yuyan's swordsmanship, in Jianghai City, could be considered somewhat impressive, but in Zhongzhou, it was absolutely not enough.</p><p></p><p>Moreover, she had been secretly learning the blade technique during this period, and her swordsmanship had regressed instead of progressing. If she could beat him, that would be a miracle.</p><p></p><p>However, Ye Xiao did not expect that she had actually grasped a blade intent, probably learned from the blade mark he had left behind.</p><p></p><p>This woman was quite stubborn when it came to the blade technique.</p><p></p><p>Unfortunately, the competition was in swordsmanship, not blade technique.</p><p></p><p>Even if Qin Yuyan practiced the blade technique to the best, it would probably be of little use.</p><p></p><p>The fact that she was cultivating the blade technique was something she dared not even tell her grandfather, so how could she dare to display it in public?</p><p></p><p>"Is this your cat?"</p><p></p><p>Qin Yuyan discovered the cat-shaped Illusion Liuli and immediately picked it up from the ground.</p><p></p><p>"So cute! So soft!"</p><p></p><p>She stroked Illusion Liuli's fur, and the delicate white little hands made Illusion Liuli very comfortable. Not only did it not resist, but it also obediently lay in her arms, enjoying the moment.</p><p></p><p>The place where it lay was even more heart-warming and comfortable, more comfortable than a sofa.</p><p></p><p>Soft and warm.</p><p></p><p>If only she could lie on it every time she slept.</p><p></p><p>Ye Xiao glanced at her and nodded slightly.</p><p></p><p>Qin Yuyan's face brushed against Illusion Liuli's fur, and a touch of warmth and envy flashed in her eyes.</p><p></p><p>"I envy you, being able to do what you want."</p><p></p><p>"You can too."</p><p></p><p>Qin Yuyan's face revealed a bitter smile as she continued to pet the cat.</p><p></p><p>"Actually, our Qin family is a swordsmanship family, and the Qin family's swordsmanship has been passed down for over two hundred years. I am the only one in this generation. So my grandfather only allows me to cultivate swordsmanship."</p><p></p><p>Ye Xiao did not respond, only silently listening.</p><p></p><p>Qin Yuyan seemed to be talking to herself.</p><p></p><p>"That Park Jiansheng from Hanzhou, I don't know if you know, he has already issued a challenge to me.</p><p></p><p>If I use swordsmanship to fight Park Jiansheng this time, I will definitely be defeated, and I may not even last two moves!</p><p></p><p>But if I can use blade technique to fight..."</p><p></p><p>At this point, a strong fighting spirit flashed in Qin Yuyan's eyes, but it was mixed with a hint of hesitation.</p><p></p><p>It was clear that she really wanted to use blade technique to fight Park Jiansheng and test her own blade technique, but she was also very wary of her grandfather, afraid that if she used blade technique, it would be difficult for her grandfather to explain.</p><p></p><p>Ye Xiao spoke up in a calm tone:</p><p></p><p>"Whether it's blade technique or swordsmanship, they all require an unwavering determination to succeed.</p><p></p><p>Like you, being afraid and hesitant, wanting to consider your grandfather's feelings while also wanting to cultivate blade technique, it would be better to go back and cultivate swordsmanship.</p><p></p><p>Although you don't like it, your swordsmanship may not be much inferior to your blade technique!"</p><p></p><p>Second update, support the new book</p><p></p><p>(This chapter is complete)</p>

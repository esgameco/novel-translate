        <h1>Chapter 209</h1>
        <div class="content">
            <p>Here is the full English translation of the Chinese excerpt:</p><p></p><p>"Sss~!"</p><p></p><p>The eyes of the crowd changed slightly, becoming more cautious.</p><p></p><p>They were not fools, they were the elite of the elite from the Jingzhou Martial Arts University. Although their abilities were not small, they would not look down on anything just because this was a small place.</p><p></p><p>Moreover, the one who said this was Chen Qingxuan, the pillar of the Formation Department of Jingzhou Martial Arts University.</p><p></p><p>His understanding of formations was not something that ordinary people could match.</p><p></p><p>If he said there was a problem, then there must be a problem.</p><p></p><p>"Professor Chen, what do you think we should do now?"</p><p></p><p>Chen Qingxuan gently stroked his chin and said, "Normally, I could try to see what's ahead. But now, we have an important task to attend to, so safety should be the priority. Let's take a detour."</p><p></p><p>"Okay! We'll listen to you."</p><p></p><p>The crowd immediately followed Chen Qingxuan and left in another direction.</p><p></p><p>About 20 minutes later.</p><p></p><p>"Professor Chen, I feel like there might be a problem. We should be no more than 100-200 kilometers away from Jianghai City, but we've been wandering in this mountain valley for so long without even seeing the city."</p><p></p><p>Chen Qingxuan's brow was almost knotted into a rope.</p><p></p><p>He was also at a loss. Logically, they should have avoided the danger just now, but in reality, there was no sense of crisis, and they were just going in circles in this mountain valley, as if they had entered the legendary "ghost wall".</p><p></p><p>"Let me take a look."</p><p></p><p>He took out some special powder from his pocket and sprinkled it on the ground. In the next moment, the powder began to make a squeaking sound and started to burn.</p><p></p><p>Seeing this, Chen Qingxuan's expression gradually became more serious.</p><p></p><p>"Professor Chen, what does this mean?"</p><p></p><p>Chen Qingxuan took a deep breath, pushed up his glasses, and said, "If I'm not mistaken, we seem to be trapped in a formation."</p><p></p><p>The air fell silent for a moment.</p><p></p><p>"Professor Chen, you're joking."</p><p></p><p>How could they, following one of the top formation experts in the Nine Provinces, be trapped in a formation? That would be a huge joke!</p><p></p><p>"I'm not joking. I'm telling the truth."</p><p></p><p>The smiles on the faces of the crowd gradually disappeared, and some even had a hint of panic.</p><p></p><p>If a formation could confuse even Professor Chen, this formation must be extraordinary.</p><p></p><p>Professor Chen pushed up his glasses and spoke again:</p><p></p><p>"To be honest, I'm quite surprised myself. I clearly sensed the danger earlier, but when we came this way, we ended up entering the formation.</p><p></p><p>Now I estimate that the range of this formation is very large, and it has a disorientating property. The stronger the formation, the harder it is to detect.</p><p></p><p>I sensed it when we were at the edge of the formation. At that time, we should have turned back, but instead, we went forward a little and ended up inside the formation.</p><p></p><p>And after entering this formation, due to its disorienting nature, I couldn't continue to sense it.</p><p></p><p>Just now, I used the Vampire Bat's Star Powder that can detect formations to confirm the existence of this formation."</p><p></p><p>"So that's how it is. I never expected Jianghai City to have such a powerful formation master."</p><p></p><p>One of them couldn't help but exclaim, while another's eyes suddenly lit up.</p><p></p><p>"Hey, if this formation master is so powerful, if we can recruit him into our team, won't we be able to complete the mission even better?"</p><p></p><p>The team leader, a high-level Shen Zong cultivator, poured a bucket of cold water on him.</p><p></p><p>"Are you still thinking about that? We're trapped in the formation now. If we can't get out, we'll be lucky if we can even survive, let alone find someone."</p><p></p><p>Chen Qingxuan smiled and said, "There's no need to be so nervous. Although this formation is very advanced, with me here, I can ensure that all of you will be safe."</p><p></p><p>The others showed smiles on their faces.</p><p></p><p>"That's right, with Professor Chen here, what do we have to be afraid of? Professor Chen, please quickly break this formation so we can carry out our mission."</p><p></p><p>Chen Qingxuan nodded and began to work on breaking the formation.</p><p></p><p>About 20 minutes later.</p><p></p><p>Chen Qingxuan exhaled a mouthful of turbid air, and his expression became even more serious.</p><p></p><p>"Unexpectedly, Jianghai City even has such an extraordinary person. Today, Chen has truly broadened his horizons!"</p><p></p><p>The others couldn't help but ask, "Professor Chen, what's wrong? Hasn't the formation been broken?"</p><p></p><p>Chen Qingxuan nodded.</p><p></p><p>"This formation is very strong. If my guess is correct, it should have reached the level of an Imperial Formation."</p><p></p><p>"What? An Imperial Formation! You're not joking with us, are you? This is just a small Jianghai City, and there's actually a formation master capable of creating an Imperial Formation?"</p><p></p><p>Chen Qingxuan explained:</p><p></p><p>"There's nothing strange about this. There are people above people, and heavens above heavens. The Nine Provinces have many hidden sages and experts. The 'Sword and Knife Immortal' who has been making waves online recently is also a powerful martial artist from Jianghai City, right?</p><p></p><p>So it's not surprising that Jianghai City also has a formation master."</p><p></p><p>"Can you still break this formation, then?"</p><p></p><p>Chen Qingxuan nodded, and the others let out a sigh of relief. If he could break it, that would be good.</p><p></p><p>Here is my translation of the Chinese excerpt you provided:</p><p></p><p>"How long do you think it will take to break through this formation?"</p><p></p><p>Chen Qingxuan pondered for a moment, then replied:</p><p></p><p>"If it's a regular formation, it should be relatively quick. For an imperial formation, my fastest record for breaking through one is 10 days, but that was a time when I had the diagram of the formation. </p><p></p><p>This formation doesn't have a diagram, so it will likely take longer, around a month or so."</p><p></p><p>"What?!" </p><p></p><p>The group was dumbfounded again, being trapped here for a month would waste so much time.</p><p></p><p>"Professor Chen, can you speed up the process a bit? We have important matters to attend to and can't afford to waste too much time here."</p><p></p><p>Chen Qingxuan took a deep breath, his expression serious:</p><p></p><p>"Alright, for the sake of the alliance's mission, I'll go all out today and bring out my family's thousand-year-old treasure for breaking formations - the Bagua Disk!</p><p></p><p>My family has ancestral teachings, and this item is not to be used lightly on normal days."</p><p></p><p>"The Bagua Disk?" </p><p></p><p>Someone who didn't know what it was couldn't help but ask.</p><p></p><p>The Daoist master present furrowed his brow in thought, then suddenly exclaimed:</p><p></p><p>"Could it be the 14th ranked divine weapon for breaking formations on the Nine Provinces Armament List - the Bagua Disk? </p><p></p><p>Rumor has it this disk has been passed down for a thousand years, forged by a famous ancient armorer, containing the essence of dozens of formations. With this disk, there is no formation that cannot be broken?"</p><p></p><p>Hearing this, the group was once again awestruck. </p><p></p><p>Indeed, Professor Chen's family lineage is extraordinary, possessing such a precious treasure.</p><p></p><p>Chen Qingxuan smiled.</p><p></p><p>"It's not quite that exaggerated. It's impossible for it to be able to break any formation in the Nine Provinces. But I'm confident I can break through 99% of the formations here."</p><p></p><p>With that, he took out a Bagua Disk from his storage ring. </p><p></p><p>It was engraved with 64 Bagua symbols, with a mirror-like circular center containing a small snake - the sealed soul of a star beast.</p><p></p><p>The group couldn't help but gulp. </p><p></p><p>So this is the Bagua Disk, the 14th ranked divine weapon for breaking formations! They were truly amazed today.</p><p></p><p>Chen Qingxuan wasted no time and began trying to break the formation.</p><p></p><p>An hour later.</p><p></p><p>Chen Qingxuan plopped down on the ground, his face deathly pale.</p><p></p><p>"Impossible! How could this be? The Bagua Disk has failed, I cannot break this formation at all!"</p><p></p><p>The expressions of the group changed completely.</p><p></p><p>"Professor Chen, you can't be joking around with us like this."</p><p></p><p>Chen Qingxuan gave a bitter smile.</p><p></p><p>"I've brought out my family's ancestral divine weapon for breaking formations, even if I wanted to joke, I wouldn't dare tarnish the reputation of my family's treasures!"</p><p></p><p>"Then what do we do now?"</p><p></p><p>"At this point, we can only try to explore and see if we can find any weaknesses in the formation, perhaps there's still a chance to break through it."</p><p></p><p>After Ye Xiao returned, the next morning he received a call from Gu Hai.</p><p></p><p>"Old Ye, I saw in the group chat that your library is going to reform, kicking out everyone below fourth rank after the day after tomorrow?"</p><p></p><p>"Yes, that's the case."</p><p></p><p>"If that's so, you're going to be in trouble. You'd better hurry and buy some good elixirs, see if you can break through to after the fourth rank. </p><p></p><p>I've transferred 50,000 to you, you can add some more of your own money and try to buy a Condensing Spirit Elixir. If you can condense your spiritual sense, breaking through the fourth rank shouldn't be a problem. You'll be able to keep your job."</p><p></p><p>"Where did you get so much money?"</p><p></p><p>"A few days ago at Meng Meng's full moon banquet, I collected some contributions. I talked it over with Wan Wan, and we decided to lend it to you first."</p><p></p><p>Meng Meng was Gu Hai's daughter, Ye Xiao's goddaughter.</p><p></p><p>"I can't take this money, you should keep it for the baby's milk powder."</p><p></p><p>"Don't be stubborn, you finally got the manager position, it would be a shame to lose such a good job."</p><p></p><p>Ye Xiao felt warmth in his heart. Although he didn't need the money, it was the heartfelt intention of the Gu couple, so he couldn't completely refuse.</p><p></p><p>"Alright, I'll take it for now, and I'll pay you back once I secure my job."</p><p></p><p>"Mm, also, these past few days, keep an eye out. Our Jianghai City just issued a bounty, looking for a group of formation masters from Jingzhou. If you can provide any clues, there's a 200,000 reward."</p><p></p><p>"Formation masters?"</p><p></p><p>"Yes, it's the elite professor Chen Qingxuan from the Formation Department of Jingzhou Military Academy, as well as his guards. I don't know what happened, but they were supposed to come to Jianghai City to set up a formation yesterday, but they've completely lost contact and can't be reached."</p><p></p><p>"Okay, I'll keep an eye out for that."</p><p></p><p>"Alright, I've got to go now, the entire city defense force is out searching for them today. Looks like they'll be busy."</p>

        <h1>Chapter 72</h1>
        <div class="content">
            <p>Here is the full English translation of the Chinese excerpt:</p><p></p><p>As soon as Ye Xiao entered the house, his expression couldn't help but change slightly.</p><p></p><p>In the courtyard, a petite girl wearing traditional Chinese clothing, who seemed to be about 1.2 meters tall, was holding up her skirt and rinsing her small feet with the water from the courtyard faucet.</p><p></p><p>Her already crystal-clear small feet became even more flawlessly white under the cleansing of the clear water.</p><p></p><p>"Are you... Huan Liuli?"</p><p></p><p>Ye Xiao recognized Huan Liuli's identity from the cat ears on her head that were different from a human's.</p><p></p><p>Huan Liuli then gave a mischievous smile.</p><p></p><p>"Hehe, Master, didn't expect that, did you? Your little pet has already advanced!"</p><p></p><p>Ye Xiao's expression was frozen for a moment.</p><p></p><p>It wasn't that he was shocked by Huan Liuli's advancement, as she had been with him for so long, and had just devoured the bodies of two Grandmaster-level experts, absorbing their bloodlines, which was enough for her to raise her cultivation.</p><p></p><p>What he was speechless about was Huan Liuri's just now smile, which looked so comical.</p><p></p><p>Such a beautiful girl, it's a pity that her personality is that of a silly fool! But since she has advanced, it's a good thing. Huan Liuli is now at the Innate Second Grade, and her strength is greater. If he were to assign her some tasks, it would be easier.</p><p></p><p>Speaking of which, when he had slain the Aier King back then, he had used a bit too much force in that move.</p><p></p><p>If he had slightly reduced the power, and just killed him without turning him into mincemeat, and then let Huan Liuli devour the remains, the boost to her would have been even greater.</p><p></p><p>Hearing what Yang Zhengyi said, the Aier King's body was sealed separately. If he were to dig out the remaining flesh, and let Huan Liuli eat it all?</p><p></p><p>After all, the individual flesh pieces would only have Grandmaster-level cultivation, and wouldn't be able to defeat him.</p><p></p><p>"By the way, where did you get these clothes from? I've never seen you wear them before."</p><p></p><p>"Of course, I got them from the dumpster at the mall."</p><p></p><p>"Dumpster?"</p><p></p><p>Ye Xiao narrowed his eyes slightly.</p><p></p><p>Huan Liuli then turned and ran away.</p><p></p><p>"I suddenly remembered that I have something to do, and won't be back for dinner tonight."</p><p></p><p>Ye Xiao shook his head.</p><p></p><p>This dead cat, she must have gone to steal something again.</p><p></p><p>He had told her so many times, but she just wouldn't change her ways!</p><p></p><p>At the end of the day, she was still a spirit beast, and the moral concepts of humans were still difficult for her to adapt to.</p><p></p><p>Oh well, he'll just have to teach her step by step.</p><p></p><p>He'll first quietly pay back the store owner, as they're just trying to make a living.</p><p></p><p>His gaze noticed the clothing tags on the ground that Huan Liuli had torn off.</p><p></p><p>18888, 39998, 19998, 69999...</p><p></p><p>Ye Xiao: "Σ(っ°Д°;)っ!"</p><p></p><p>What kind of clothes are these? How can they be so expensive? Are traditional Chinese clothes this pricey? It's just a piece of cloth! It's not even some kind of protective armor! Damn it! Most importantly, one of the little cuties cost 19998? Is it made of gold? It's almost equal to his weekly salary.</p><p></p><p>Looks like he'll have to teach Huan Liuli properly in the future, stealing is really wrong.</p><p></p><p>With a soft sigh, Ye Xiao collected the tags in his hand, and will first focus on cultivating his movement technique.</p><p></p><p>Ye Xiao returned to his room, firmly closed the door, and immediately activated his divine sense, beginning the fusion.</p><p></p><p>A dazzling golden light radiated from his body, illuminating the entire room.</p><p></p><p>The pages recording the movement technique gradually revealed the basic terms.</p><p></p><p>Speed! Swiftness! Surpass! Void! Spirit! The nine fundamental movement techniques fused and integrated, refining and evolving all types of basic movement techniques into a...</p><p></p><p>Here is the full English translation of the Chinese excerpt:</p><p></p><p>The Door, the supreme martial art that encompasses all the techniques in the world! The Divinity Technique! This martial art can grant Ye Xiao the power to break free from the shackles of the physical body.</p><p></p><p>Normally, for a human body to move, the brain needs to issue commands, and then the body will carry out the requirements of those commands, circulating spiritual energy to drive the body to the desired location.</p><p></p><p>The process involves the brain - the body - circulating spiritual energy - the body acting - arriving at the destination.</p><p></p><p>But the process of the Divinity Technique is brain - circulating spiritual energy - arriving at the destination.</p><p></p><p>It bypasses the body, as soon as the thought arises, the spiritual energy has already carried the body to the desired location.</p><p></p><p>It skips the two steps of the brain issuing commands to the body and the body's response.</p><p></p><p>Of course, the speed of this process also depends on the cultivator's cultivation level.</p><p></p><p>If the cultivation is not strong enough, like a Sect Master using a technique, it will definitely not be as fast as a Grand Sect Master using the same technique.</p><p></p><p>However, it is still quite impressive, significantly increasing the speed.</p><p></p><p>From this perspective, if a Sect Master uses the Divinity Technique, they can surpass a Grand Sect Master who has cultivated other Sect Master-level martial arts. </p><p></p><p>In other words, they can perform abilities beyond their level! Quite remarkable.</p><p></p><p>After fusing the martial art, the divine soul began to rapidly cultivate.</p><p></p><p>About five hours later, in the latter half of the night, the Golden Book divine soul had completed the cultivation of the Divinity Technique.</p><p></p><p>This is something Ye Xiao actually couldn't quite understand.</p><p></p><p>Why is it that the fused technique, though of a higher level and significantly more advanced, was cultivated much faster by the Golden Book?</p><p></p><p>While those basic techniques required a full day to reach the peak realm.</p><p></p><p>Could it be that those techniques require analysis and research to grasp the underlying principles?</p><p></p><p>And once the basic principles are understood, using them to evolve can yield vastly different effects?</p><p></p><p>After all, when you first use a Spiritual Elf Trap, you need to carefully read the instructions, then cautiously open the bag and examine which side is the front and which is the back.</p><p></p><p>But after using it many times, even in the dark, you can accurately determine the front and back. Practice makes perfect, right?</p><p></p><p>Perhaps it's something like that.</p><p></p><p>Anyway, as long as it can be used, that's good enough.</p><p></p><p>Huan Liuli has already returned and is sleeping soundly on the sofa. She has changed into cartoon pajamas, but her little feet are still wearing stockings. I don't know if this girl has some special quirk.</p><p></p><p>With a thought, he activates the Divinity Technique and instantly vanishes from the spot.</p><p></p><p>This time, Huan Liuli didn't feel anything at all throughout the process.</p><p></p><p>It's worth noting that in the past, when Ye Xiao went out, Huan Liuli would still have a slight sense of it, even though her cultivation was only at the Innate First Grade. But now, she has reached the Innate Second Grade, and her perception has become even stronger!</p><p></p><p>The Divinity Technique is truly powerful! Its speed is mind-boggling!</p><p></p><p>But just three seconds later, a violent explosion suddenly echoed from a mountain peak outside of Jianghai City! Boom! The thunderous sound shook the heavens and earth, startling half the city of Jianghai.</p><p></p><p>"It's an earthquake!"</p><p>"Quick, run!"</p><p>"I'm not even dressed!"</p><p>"Who cares about clothes, just wear a mask, no one will see your face!"</p><p></p><p>Second update, please support and recommend.</p><p>It's so difficult to write, having to create new techniques and plot.</p><p></p><p>(End of this chapter)</p>

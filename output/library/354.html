        <h1>Chapter 354</h1>
        <div class="content">
            <p>Here is the full English translation of the Chinese excerpt:</p><p></p><p>After taking everything out, it looked like a small mountain nearly a kilometer high.</p><p></p><p>The star beasts in the star beast breeding farm were really too many. Every day, they continuously provided flesh and blood, and after accumulating for a long time, it reached the size of a small mountain.</p><p></p><p>Then Ye Xiao took out the star cores of Lin Qingbei and the others.</p><p></p><p>There were super divine-level star cores, as well as divine beast-level ones, and more were at the level of grand supreme masters. In short, Ye Xiao killed and slaughtered all the star beasts that were not suitable for eating, and directly dug out their star cores.</p><p></p><p>The star cores were the souls of the medicinal materials for refining dan, and they were also the core of the medicinal materials. The qi in the flesh and blood was to enhance the existence of the dan.</p><p></p><p>When the two were combined, they would complement each other.</p><p></p><p>Ye Xiao practiced the divine Luo dan success method, blending and fusing, and all the star cores were instantly shattered. The essence inside them condensed together like stars, rapidly forming a solidified, highly spiritual core.</p><p></p><p>Then Ye Xiao refined the mountain-like star beast meat, attracting out all the blood qi within.</p><p></p><p>The star beast meat without blood qi was like ashes, without the slightest trace of nutrition. Without any wind blowing, it would naturally decay.</p><p></p><p>Thousands upon thousands of streams of blood qi continuously converged onto that core, adhering to it.</p><p></p><p>Rumbling, in the sky above, a large expanse of thunder clouds began to condense again. This time, the thunder tribulation was specifically generated for the divine dan. The thunder tribulation just caused by the divine formation had not yet dispersed and was still hovering in the sky.</p><p></p><p>This sizable commotion was soon transmitted out, quickly attracting the attention of a few rare beings in the surrounding starry skies.</p><p></p><p>"Up ahead, we're about to reach the Xuanyuan Clan and the Thunder God Clan, who have discovered the location of the divine tomb. I heard that this time, many tomb sites have been discovered, far more than just one or two. We should also go and get a share."</p><p></p><p>"Before the reinforcements from the major clans arrive, let's first snatch some things and leave."</p><p></p><p>"Yes, we can't let them take all the good stuff."</p><p></p><p>As they spoke, several figures soon encountered the disturbance in the asteroid group and couldn't help but be startled.</p><p></p><p>"This is... thunder tribulation? This feeling, it's dan tribulation! My goodness, there's actually someone refining dan here, and they've even triggered thunder tribulation."</p><p></p><p>"Judging from the scale of this dan tribulation, this dan is definitely not simple."</p><p></p><p>"Let's go take a look."</p><p></p><p>Several figures quickly surrounded the area.</p><p></p><p>However, when they saw the potent spiritual energy of the dan Ye Xiao was refining, they couldn't help but exclaim in amazement, "Heavens, such a massive spiritual energy! This dan has already transcended the realm of emperor dan and is a divine dan! This is definitely a divine dan!"</p><p></p><p>"Quick! Snatch this dan away."</p><p></p><p>However, just as some of them were about to act, their companions next to them promptly stopped them.</p><p></p><p>"Why the hurry? Can't you see that the dan hasn't been completely refined yet? Don't go disturb him. Let him continue refining the dan, and then we'll go seize this dan when it's finished. That would be more valuable."</p><p></p><p>"Yes, yes, yes."</p><p></p><p>The crowd nodded in agreement.</p><p></p><p>"All of you, hide your auras well. Don't let him discover us."</p><p></p><p>The crowd hid behind the asteroids, secretly and excitedly watching Ye Xiao refine the dan.</p><p></p><p>Of course, Ye Xiao knew that people had come, but these people, no matter how strong they were, could not surpass him, especially since he had cultivated the spiritual cultivation method.</p><p></p><p>It was difficult to find a place in the entire starry sky that was completely devoid of people, so he could only try to find a place with fewer people.</p><p></p><p>And these few people were not weak either, with their strengths averaging around the Emperor Realm 30-40 dragons, and the strongest one even reaching the Emperor Realm 58 dragons, which was indeed not low.</p><p></p><p>Being able to detect his abnormal activity was also normal.</p><p></p><p>He didn't speak, nor did he alert them, completely focused on refining his own dan. He had already thought of a strategy in his heart.</p><p></p><p>Crackle—! At this moment, the first bolt of dan tribulation lightning began to fall, heavily striking the divine dan.</p><p></p><p>The dan shook violently, but it also squeezed out some impurities. At the same time, the power of the lightning also greatly enhanced the spiritual energy of the dan.</p><p></p><p>Then the second, third, fourth, and more bolts of lightning continuously fell on the dan, with each strike making the divine dan even stronger.</p><p></p><p>The divine dan had begun to emit a faint golden light, and some special patterns unique to divine dans had also appeared on it.</p><p></p><p>The few figures hiding in the distance couldn't help but sigh with admiration, "This person's dan refining ability is truly too strong!"</p><p></p><p>"At such a young age, he can possess such powerful dan refining ability. Looking across the entire starry sky, he is absolutely a dan refining genius. His strength may not be inferior to the top-tier dan refining prodigies of the major starry sky clans! He is truly a heaven-blessed talent!"</p><p></p><p>"I think it's best not to kill him later. We should capture him and have him refine dan for us in the future."</p><p></p><p>"That's right, we need the dan, and we need him too. Haha haha."</p><p></p><p>"Keep it down, don't startle him and affect his dan refining."</p><p></p><p>The speed of the thunder tribulation falling from the sky was getting faster and faster, and the dan was becoming increasingly perfected.</p><p></p><p>Here is the full English translation of the Chinese excerpt:</p><p></p><p>The formation was constantly emitting a series of cries from within. </p><p></p><p>It had developed its own spiritual awareness, just like a newly created life.</p><p></p><p>Finally, when the thunder tribulation reached a certain level, it thunderously condensed the last extremely powerful cinnabar thunder.</p><p></p><p>Boom! It violently struck down on the divine elixir, causing the divine elixir to emit brilliant light and a phoenix-like cry.</p><p></p><p>The divine elixir, success!</p><p></p><p>After taking form, the divine elixir immediately prepared to flee, as it had developed consciousness and knew that if it didn't run, it would definitely be devoured by Ye Xiao.</p><p></p><p>Moreover, its consciousness was stronger and its speed faster than the imperial elixir. </p><p></p><p>It could even sense that behind those meteorites, there was another existence coveting it.</p><p></p><p>So it avoided those people and chose to run in another direction.</p><p></p><p>But unfortunately, in front of Ye Xiao, it had no chance of escaping.</p><p></p><p>In the next moment, the divine art claw technique断星河 (Severing the Stellar River) was activated.</p><p></p><p>The divine elixir that had just run out was instantly confined in a small world, and then grabbed back by Ye Xiao, constantly emitting trembling cries in Ye Xiao's palm.</p><p></p><p>However, at this moment, a sound of applause suddenly came to Ye Xiao's ears.</p><p></p><p>Clap, clap, clap - a very familiar rhythm for adults.</p><p></p><p>"You are truly a genius alchemist. Your alchemy skills are truly admirable. Respect, respect."</p><p></p><p>Ye Xiao glanced at them indifferently without saying a word.</p><p></p><p>The few people were somewhat angry, feeling outraged by Ye Xiao's light and negligent attitude.</p><p></p><p>However, they still had some restraint, because their target was not just the divine elixir in Ye Xiao's hand.</p><p></p><p>What they wanted was Ye Xiao himself.</p><p></p><p>"We want to make a deal with you. This starry sky is full of dangers, and one careless mistake could lead to eternal damnation. We want you to join us and become one of us.</p><p></p><p>With our protection, you can rest assured to practice alchemy in the future, without worrying about your elixirs being coveted or stolen.</p><p></p><p>That divine elixir is like your admission ticket to us."</p><p></p><p>Ye Xiao still didn't respond to them, as these were just insignificant insects, not worthy of his attention.</p><p></p><p>To put it bluntly, these people didn't even have the qualifications to make him take action.</p><p></p><p>He directly released his full aura and began to undergo the tribulation. As the tribulation clouds emerged, all living beings were annihilated. These people were just seeking their own death, and it was not his fault.</p><p></p><p>Sensing this terrifying aura, the expressions of the group changed instantly.</p><p></p><p>"Powerful aura. Damn it, your cultivation is actually at the late Emperor Realm?"</p><p></p><p>The group simply couldn't believe their eyes.</p><p></p><p>An alchemist! Yet he had such powerful cultivation.</p><p></p><p>Because alchemists were originally considered auxiliary professions, only those with poor cultivation aptitude would cultivate this.</p><p></p><p>But unexpectedly, Ye Xiao, this alchemist, was actually at the late Emperor Realm!</p><p></p><p>Moreover, judging from his bone age, he was so young, this guy was simply a demonic prodigy!</p><p></p><p>Rumble. At this moment, a huge thunderous sound suddenly erupted in the sky.</p><p></p><p>The group couldn't help but shudder, then immediately looked up at the sky.</p><p></p><p>In the next moment, the group completely collapsed.</p><p></p><p>The thundercloud pressure in the sky above, that was the Heavenly Tribulation! Unlike the Cinnabar Thunder Tribulation, the power of this Heavenly Tribulation was over a hundred times stronger! This was the Warrior's Tribulation! "Damn it! He's not just at the late Emperor Realm, he's at the Emperor Realm Pinnacle, the 108 Dragon Emperor Realm! He's going to ascend to godhood through the tribulation."</p><p></p><p>A chill ran from the soles of their feet to the top of their heads.</p><p></p><p>At this moment, the group finally realized why Ye Xiao's strength was so powerful, and why he didn't take any action against them despite their approach.</p><p></p><p>It was because he was about to undergo the tribulation, and under the tribulation clouds, they, as insignificant insects, didn't even have the chance to escape.</p><p></p><p>They had fallen into a certain death situation! The other party didn't even bother to care about them.</p><p></p><p>It's over! Everything is over.</p><p></p><p>Facing the terrifying divine might, they didn't even have the desire to resist.</p><p></p><p>Sizzle—! A lightning bolt struck, and in an instant, several Emperor Realm figures were all shattered, not a single one able to escape.</p><p></p><p>Under the Heavenly Tribulation, no living being could escape.</p><p></p><p>And the Heavenly Tribulation had its own consciousness.</p><p></p><p>It knew its target was Ye Xiao alone.</p><p></p><p>And it also knew that Ye Xiao, its prey, was not easy to swallow.</p><p></p><p>Similarly, the Heavenly Tribulation had its own pride.</p><p></p><p>Aside from Ye Xiao, the other Emperors here were just trash, and trash was not qualified to appear on its battlefield.</p><p></p><p>Ye Xiao looked at the tribulation in the sky, and this tribulation was actually purple in color.</p><p></p><p>He had done his homework before, and according to the books he had brought from the XuanYuan Clan, the tribulation for ascending to godhood should be black in color.</p><p></p><p>But the purple tribulation, the books had no record of it.</p><p></p><p>Extraordinary!</p><p></p><p>(This chapter ends)</p>

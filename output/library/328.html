        <h1>Chapter 328</h1>
        <div class="content">
            <p>Here is the full English translation of the Chinese excerpt:</p><p></p><p>Ye Xiao nodded and started drinking with his two old friends.</p><p></p><p>On the other side, in the starry sky, the war was raging.</p><p></p><p>The battle between the Star Beasts and the human race had reached an even more violent stage than the white-hot one.</p><p></p><p>In fact, many Star Beasts and human cultivators had started to self-destruct by rushing into each other's territories, in order to gain greater destructive power.</p><p></p><p>All human forces had gathered together.</p><p></p><p>Whether from the East or the West, they had combined their troops.</p><p></p><p>Normally, after the Seven Stars Convergence, the overall strength of the Star Beasts would enter a sustained upward phase.</p><p></p><p>But there was a limit, which was to reach its peak during the Beast Calamity, and the starry sky battlefield would often be arranged according to this point.</p><p></p><p>But this time, a second Seven Stars Convergence occurred.</p><p></p><p>The two Seven Stars Convergences happened so close together that the Star Beasts, who were originally supposed to reach their peak during the Beast Calamity, had now directly reached their peak.</p><p></p><p>This directly disrupted the entire deployment of the starry sky battlefield.</p><p></p><p>Not only that.</p><p></p><p>Even more terrifying was that the number of Supernal Realm Star Beasts had mysteriously increased a lot this time.</p><p></p><p>This plunged the already heavily pressured starry sky battlefield into an even more dangerous situation.</p><p></p><p>The six Emperor Realm human experts were all striving to resist the Star Beasts, and the battle had become so deadlocked that they could no longer distinguish each other.</p><p></p><p>In the starry sky, there were flashes of light everywhere.</p><p></p><p>The light from the explosions.</p><p></p><p>And at this moment, an unexpected incident suddenly occurred.</p><p></p><p>From the ground world, the auras of dozens of Supernal Realm experts suddenly rose up!</p><p></p><p>One! Two!</p><p></p><p>Ten!</p><p></p><p>In the end, dozens of them emerged! This terrifying scene directly plunged countless human cultivators into despair.</p><p></p><p>"What's going on? Why did so many Supernal Realm auras suddenly emerge from the ground?" </p><p></p><p>The South Alliance Vajra Emperor punched back a Supernal Realm Star Beast in front of him! The next moment, the opponent came after him again.</p><p></p><p>"Are you curious? Let me tell you the truth! We have completely conquered the ground world. All the humans have been refined by us, and those Supernal Realm experts were cultivated from the divine blood within your human bodies."</p><p></p><p>Boom! This sentence was like a heavy bomb exploding in everyone's minds.</p><p></p><p>The ground has fallen? The ground has completely fallen? The humans have been slaughtered? In an instant, the situation on the starry sky battlefield had become completely one-sided.</p><p></p><p>Without the will to fight, the human cultivators were being pushed back by the fervent Star Beasts.</p><p></p><p>Every second, humans were dying! Every second, the Star Beasts were occupying more territory.</p><p></p><p>Among the six human Emperors, the white-haired Cloud Emperor pushed back the Supernal Realm Star Beast in front of him and shouted:</p><p></p><p>"Don't listen to their nonsense! This is a scheme of the Star Beasts, they want to disrupt our morale and make us lose the will to resist."</p><p></p><p>On the other side, the Jing Emperor also shouted loudly:</p><p></p><p>"The human race will not perish! We must not give up here. If we die, then the ground will truly fall!</p><p></p><p>Think of our loved ones, our descendants. They are all on the ground! Don't give up, keep fighting!"</p><p></p><p>These cries rekindled the fighting spirit of the human cultivators on the starry sky battlefield, but the Star Beasts on the other side also launched even more frantic attacks.</p><p></p><p>Dozens of Supernal Realm Star Beasts had already surrounded and were ruthlessly slaughtering the humans.</p><p></p><p>The defeat was already decided!</p><p></p><p>Even if the human troops still had the will to fight, it was futile.</p><p></p><p>The combat power of the opponents was simply too strong, completely forming a crushing posture.</p><p></p><p>They couldn't withstand it at all.</p><p></p><p>Seeing this scene, the humans were completely in despair.</p><p></p><p>Even those few Emperor Realm experts had lost hope in their eyes, their gaze turning blood-red with rage.</p><p></p><p>Each Emperor Realm expert was surrounded by several Supernal Realm Star Beasts.</p><p></p><p>To avoid injury, the opponents did not use overly intense combat methods against the Emperor Realm experts, but only constantly harassed and consumed them, to prevent a counterattack from the human Emperors.</p><p></p><p>The Amerikan Wolf Emperor let out a roar, forcefully shaking off all the Supernal Realm Star Beasts, and self-mockingly smiled:</p><p></p><p>"I never thought that after struggling for so many years, I would end up in this situation in the end.</p><p></p><p>Forget it! Forget it! This is the will of heaven.</p><p></p><p>But although we, the descendants of the Wing God Clan, will die, we will not let you beasts gloat!"</p><p></p><p>As he spoke, his body suddenly emitted an extremely strong light.</p><p></p><p>The other Star Beasts couldn't help but have their pupils constrict.</p><p></p><p>"Not good! He wants to summon the Wing God Clan experts with his own life! We absolutely cannot let him succeed, or we'll be in real trouble."</p><p></p><p>But at this moment, the Great Emperor from the Western Alliance charged over to guard the Wolf Emperor.</p><p></p><p>"You want to disrupt the Wolf Emperor's summoning? Dream on!"</p><p></p><p>The Supernal Realm Star Beasts attacked, and all their attacks landed on him, and the next moment, the Wolf Emperor also completely erupted in a burst of blood qi, blooming a dazzling light in the starry sky, like a firework, brilliant but fleeting.</p><p></p><p>"Damn it!"</p><p></p><p>At this time, several Supernal Realm Star Beasts directly attacked that Great Emperor with full force, instantly killing him on the spot.</p><p></p><p>Here is the full English translation of the Chinese excerpt:</p><p></p><p>Before the great emperor fell, he excitedly shouted:</p><p></p><p>"Haha, the summoning has succeeded! The powerful experts of the Winged God Clan will soon descend!</p><p></p><p>I hope that by then, you won't piss your pants. I'll be waiting for you in hell!"</p><p></p><p>The two human emperors who had fallen were deeply shocked by this sight. The Vajra Emperor and the Thunder Emperor were also not to be outdone.</p><p></p><p>"Forget it! Rather than letting these star beasts ambush and refine our divine blood, it's better to die and have a chance for revenge!"</p><p></p><p>As the words fell, an extremely strong light began to emanate from the two of them.</p><p></p><p>"Damn it!"</p><p></p><p>The other super gods, having learned their lesson earlier, dared not be careless at this moment. They all rushed over immediately.</p><p></p><p>But it was obvious that their speed could not match the speed of the self-explosion.</p><p></p><p>In the blink of an eye, two dazzling beams of light were released in the starry sky.</p><p></p><p>The twelve veteran super gods had gloomy expressions on their faces.</p><p></p><p>Only six of them could come out to fight, while the other six seemed to be arranging an extremely special formation to shield the aura of this world and spread it to the depths of the universe.</p><p></p><p>"Hurry! Accelerate the attack and kill everyone completely, then quickly retreat."</p><p></p><p>The Cloud Emperor and the Scenery Emperor were under increasing pressure. They looked at each other.</p><p></p><p>The Scenery Emperor spoke:</p><p></p><p>"Cloud Emperor, what do you think?"</p><p></p><p>The Cloud Emperor's eyes flickered as he said:</p><p></p><p>"I don't believe the human race will be completely wiped out so quickly! Especially the people of the Nine States. I have a strong feeling that our compatriots are not dead."</p><p></p><p>"You're right. Even if we die, we should die with dignity. Let's take the warriors of the Nine States and retreat to the Nine States! I want to see the mountains and rivers of the Nine States one more time even if I die!"</p><p></p><p>As he spoke, the Cloud Emperor took out a jade seal.</p><p></p><p>The jade seal flashed with light, directly absorbing all the warriors of the Nine States on the battlefield.</p><p></p><p>After doing all this, the two of them turned and fled like streams of light.</p><p></p><p>The twelve veteran super gods, who were already furious because the Wolf Emperor had summoned the powerful experts of the God Clan, were now even more enraged.</p><p></p><p>"Damn it! We absolutely cannot let them escape. No matter what, we have to catch them! If we don't get the Xuanyuan divine blood, we won't be able to report to the young master, and we'll all die."</p><p></p><p>"All star beasts below the super god realm, stay behind to suppress the other human races. The rest of the super gods, pursue and kill those two!"</p><p></p><p>After these words were spoken, dozens of streams of light rushed towards the Earth, chasing the Scenery Emperor and the Cloud Emperor.</p><p></p><p>In the starry sky, the six divine beasts maintaining the formation had gloomy expressions.</p><p></p><p>"Damn it! I didn't expect that in the end, they would choose to die together."</p><p></p><p>"We were careless. The human race in this world, except for the Xuanyuan clan, had drifted here on their own. The others were all exiled here for violating their clan rules.</p><p></p><p>As criminals, they couldn't summon their own god clan to save themselves.</p><p></p><p>But we forgot that although they couldn't summon their own god clan to save themselves, it didn't mean they couldn't convey the events here to their god clan.</p><p></p><p>Refining and consuming divine blood from god clan descendants is a great taboo in the god clan! They may not care about these descendants, but they can't not care about the divine blood that has been stripped from them!</p><p></p><p>This is going to be troublesome. There's no way we can wait for these god clans to come, or we'll be doomed."</p><p></p><p>"An even more troublesome thing now is that we haven't succeeded in capturing the descendants of the Xuanyuan clan.</p><p></p><p>The young master values the fresh blood of the Xuanyuan clan descendants the most.</p><p></p><p>If we can't get the fresh blood of the Xuanyuan clan descendants, I'm afraid we won't be able to pass the young master's test."</p><p></p><p>"Never mind him, things have developed to this point, and we can only take it step by step now.</p><p></p><p>Hopefully they can capture the Scenery Emperor and the Cloud Emperor, and then retreat to find the young master. At least that can make up for some of it."</p><p></p><p>"Hopefully."</p><p></p><p>Underground, Ye Xiao and the others had finished their hot pot dinner and were walking out of the restaurant.</p><p></p><p>"Old Ye, you have to teach me a few tricks in the future to help me improve my strength. Otherwise, being with you two makes me feel so uneasy.</p><p></p><p>You two are too strong, a fart from you could kill me, I can't even play with you."</p><p></p><p>Ye Xiao smiled wryly.</p><p></p><p>"Don't worry, we'll talk about it when we have time."</p><p></p><p>"Okay! Then I'll go back home first. I still need to take care of my daughter."</p><p></p><p>"Go ahead."</p><p></p><p>Gu Hai rode his electric scooter and left, and Liu Chengxun also spoke:</p><p></p><p>"Let's go back to the library as well. You should be staying at the library recently, right?"</p><p></p><p>Ye Xiao nodded.</p><p></p><p>"There are too many tents around my house, too many people, so I can only stay at the library for now."</p><p></p><p>"Alright, let's go then."</p><p></p><p>"Mm!"</p><p></p><p>Ye Xiao had just responded when he suddenly paused and looked up at the sky.</p><p></p><p>"What's wrong?"</p><p></p><p>Liu Chengxun didn't have Ye Xiao's cultivation, so he couldn't sense what Ye Xiao could sense.</p><p></p><p>Ye Xiao kept his gaze fixed on the sky.</p><p></p><p>"Something doesn't seem quite right."</p>

        <h1>Chapter 289</h1>
        <div class="content">
            <p>Here is the full English translation of the Chinese excerpt:</p><p></p><p>"We still need to wait a few more days. Although we have already excavated the ruins, the restrictions on the ruins have not yet fully manifested.</p><p></p><p>In a few more days, as soon as they appear, the two of us will go and break the restrictions to obtain the inheritance within."</p><p></p><p>Ye Xiao nodded.</p><p></p><p>The main hall fell into a moment of silence. Ye Xiao generally spoke less, and even if it had been a long time since they had seen each other, if there was nothing to talk about, there was usually not much to discuss.</p><p></p><p>But Ning Yuhen obviously still had something he wanted to say to him, but the words kept getting stuck in his throat.</p><p></p><p>Seeing his hesitant expression, Ye Xiao spoke up:</p><p></p><p>"Do you have something you want to say? Feel free to say it."</p><p></p><p>Ning Yuhen took a deep breath, then said solemnly:</p><p></p><p>"Since the master has asked me to speak, then I will. I hope the master will not get angry."</p><p></p><p>After a pause, he said seriously:</p><p></p><p>"In fact, the reason for having the master come here is not just because there is an imperial realm inheritance of the human race here, and we want the master to experience the opportunity.</p><p></p><p>There is also another matter, and that is, I want to ask the master to stay in the Silver Fox Valley from now on."</p><p></p><p>Ye Xiao raised his eyebrows slightly, and Ning Yuhen continued:</p><p></p><p>"Master, don't get angry, just hear me out.</p><p></p><p>You should know the current situation of the human race, surrounded by countless spirit beasts, already like a fish on the chopping board.</p><p></p><p>Perhaps you may think that the human race still has a chance to be saved. But in reality, the human race has reached the end of the road.</p><p></p><p>Hundreds of years ago, the spirit beasts had already begun to plan and arrange, trying to completely wipe out the human race in this world.</p><p></p><p>This plan is now about to enter the final stage of reaping."</p><p></p><p>"The human race currently only has six Emperor Realm experts, but the spirit beasts have already gathered twelve Supernal Beings, and nearly two hundred divine beasts.</p><p></p><p>Such powerful strength has far surpassed the power possessed by the human race.</p><p></p><p>Their purpose is to devour the human race.</p><p></p><p>The next beast disaster will not be in more than three years, but very soon, at most it will not last more than half a year.</p><p></p><p>Once the beast disaster begins, the spirit beasts will launch a full-scale attack on the human race.</p><p></p><p>No, this time it can no longer be called a beast disaster, it is the human race's impending doom!"</p><p></p><p>Ye Xiao's gaze became somewhat grave. He had previously learned from other spirit beasts that this beast disaster would be more fierce than ever before, but he didn't expect it to be this serious.</p><p></p><p>The spirit beast clan has actually gathered a total of twelve Supernal Beings!</p><p></p><p>What a concept is this? This means that the spirit beasts will send out a total of twelve existences comparable to the Emperor Realm experts of the human race.</p><p></p><p>This is double the number of the human race. To put it bluntly, even if it's a one-to-one exchange, the human race cannot withstand it.</p><p></p><p>"Do you know why the spirit beasts are doing this? Is it just to refine the divine blood within the human race?"</p><p></p><p>Ning Yuhen shook his head.</p><p></p><p>"Yes, but not entirely. To be precise, the spirit beasts have no choice but to refine the divine blood of the human race.</p><p></p><p>The range of this star realm is really too vast, far beyond your imagination.</p><p></p><p>Within this star realm, there are many other forces and super experts. These spirit beasts are not only fighting against the human race of this world, their enemies are all over the star realm.</p><p></p><p>It may be other spirit beast clans, it may be the human race of other worlds.</p><p></p><p>Even the so-called Godly Clan.</p><p></p><p>The reason why they are so anxious to devour the human race is because they are facing an even greater threat, and they have to quickly increase their own strength."</p><p></p><p>This time, Ye Xiao's gaze became even more grave.</p><p></p><p>This universe is really too vast, and the strong experts and powerful races within it are countless.</p><p></p><p>The spirit beasts that the human race is currently struggling with may not be the ultimate enemy of the human race. Above the spirit beasts, there are even more powerful existences.</p><p></p><p>Is it more powerful spirit beasts? More powerful human races? Or... the Godly Clan?</p><p></p><p>It seems that my cultivation still has a long way to go.</p><p></p><p>However, for now, I don't need to consider that far. I should just focus on step-by-step cultivation, without being too impatient.</p><p></p><p>First, I need to raise my cultivation to the Emperor Realm.</p><p></p><p>"So, you want me to stay in the Silver Fox Clan?"</p><p></p><p>"Yes!"</p><p></p><p>Ning Yuhen said sincerely:</p><p></p><p>"Master, I have received the enlightenment of the elders of the Silver Fox Clan, and my current strength is already a Primordial Saint Realm expert at the eighth level, just one step away from breaking through to the ninth level of the Primordial Saint Realm.</p><p></p><p>Although this strength is not considered much in the vast universe, with the protection of the Silver Fox Clan, it should be more than enough.</p><p></p><p>Especially my aunt, she is a half-step King Realm existence."</p><p></p><p>Ye Xiao knew that Ning Yuhen was doing this for his own good. He didn't know Ye Xiao's current strength, thinking he was at most just a Saint Realm expert, and with this strength, staying in the human race would definitely lead to his death.</p><p></p><p>Moreover, the entire human race will be destroyed. Even if he was strong, it would be better to stay in the Silver Fox Clan.</p><p></p><p>The Silver Fox Clan itself has decent strength, and as spirit beasts, they basically won't have conflicts with other spirit beasts. It's very safe.</p><p></p><p>If it was the Ye Xiao who had just transmigrated here, he might have agreed, because at that time he had no friends and no one to help him.</p><p></p><p>Here is the full English translation of the Chinese excerpt:</p><p></p><p>The people who helped themselves.</p><p></p><p>And now, in the city of Jianghai, he has many friends, most of whom are quite weak in strength, and in his eyes, they are just ordinary people.</p><p></p><p>But the care and help they have given him in his own growth path are countless.</p><p></p><p>In addition, there are also Beitang Ce, Xuanwu Venerable, and Dragon Vein Elders. The help they have given him is also considerable.</p><p></p><p>If it were not for their help, even with the help of the Golden Book, he would have steadily improved, but it would be absolutely impossible for him to rise from a Divine Ancestor to a Half-Step Emperor Realm existence in such a short time.</p><p></p><p>If he could not improve so quickly, how would he face the descent of the Star Beasts? Even if he was extraordinary, he would still become the prey of the Star Beasts.</p><p></p><p>Someone said that the biggest difference between humans and beasts is that humans have a conscience.</p><p></p><p>If one loses their conscience, then they can no longer be called human.</p><p></p><p>Of course, this does not mean that Ye Xiao wants to become a great philanthropist or savior.</p><p></p><p>He just wants to repay those who have helped him within his own abilities.</p><p></p><p>So, he will definitely not tuck his head in like a turtle and watch the Star Beasts slaughter the human race.</p><p></p><p>So, Ye Xiao shook his head.</p><p></p><p>"I definitely won't stay here. I am a human, and I can't abandon the Nine States and only care about my own survival."</p><p></p><p>Ning Yuthen was a little anxious.</p><p></p><p>"But Master, you will die. Aren't you afraid?"</p><p></p><p>Ye Xiao smiled slightly.</p><p></p><p>"If I had been afraid of death and didn't help you back then, what would you be like now?"</p><p></p><p>Ning Yuthen was suddenly stunned.</p><p></p><p>That's right, the master was right.</p><p></p><p>If the master had been a selfish and self-interested person, he wouldn't have helped her back then.</p><p></p><p>If the master hadn't helped her, she wouldn't have been able to return to the Silver Fox Clan.</p><p></p><p>After all, this is the master's character, a very gentle person.</p><p></p><p>If he gave up returning to the human world and stayed here to take refuge, then he would no longer be himself.</p><p></p><p>Taking a deep breath, Ning Yuthen sighed, "I underestimated the master. I'm sorry."</p><p></p><p>Ye Xiao shook his head.</p><p></p><p>"You were just thinking of me, there's no need to apologize."</p><p></p><p>Ning Yuthen slapped her forehead.</p><p></p><p>"Look, I just came to the master and talked about such a heavy topic. How boring. I haven't even had a chance to take the master to see the scenery of the Silver Fox Valley yet.</p><p></p><p>And grandma has already prepared a feast, let's have dinner first."</p><p></p><p>Ye Xiao nodded.</p><p></p><p>In the following time, Ning Yuthen accompanied Ye Xiao and enjoyed a sumptuous meal.</p><p></p><p>The food of the Silver Fox Clan was also made from the meat of Star Beasts, of course, other types of Star Beasts.</p><p></p><p>However, the Star Beast meat they used was not of a high rank.</p><p></p><p>The highest dish was only at the Grand Master level.</p><p></p><p>This was very normal, as they did not have such powerful strength themselves.</p><p></p><p>Moreover, the Fox Queen would not go hunting herself, as that would not only be very dangerous, but also very undignified.</p><p></p><p>After the meal, Ning Yuthen took Ye Xiao on a tour of the Silver Fox Valley and let him appreciate the scenery.</p><p></p><p>To be honest, the place in the starry sky really looked like a fairyland.</p><p></p><p>Perhaps it was because there were not so many lives living here, so the environment was relatively fresher.</p><p></p><p>Unlike the human world, where human habitation was too dense and various pollutions made the environment greatly lacking.</p><p></p><p>After a simple tour, Ye Xiao returned to the room arranged for him by the Fox Clan, and they even arranged two little fox girls to serve him for bathing and dressing.</p><p></p><p>Ye Xiao firmly refused this.</p><p></p><p>He was a person who had experienced socialist education and had very correct values.</p><p></p><p>How could he do such a despicable thing? Looking at those two little buns, he was not a pervert.</p><p></p><p>Moreover, even if it was a big fox, Ye Xiao would not accept it.</p><p></p><p>If he had a relationship with any woman, he would definitely not just use and discard her.</p><p></p><p>The most important thing for a man is to learn to take responsibility.</p><p></p><p>So, he absolutely would not easily touch these foxes.</p><p></p><p>He would only do something like that in the future when he met a girl he liked.</p><p></p><p>Apart from that, even if the Fox Queen herself came, he would not lose his mind.</p><p></p><p>After dismissing the two fox maids, Ye Xiao returned to the bed and began to enter a state of meditation, trying to comprehend the last bit of the Dao of Martial Arts.</p><p></p><p>And under the night sky, a figure quietly sneaked into the Silver Fox Valley.</p><p></p><p>"I heard that the Silver Fox Valley has discovered the ruins of an Imperial Realm expert of the human race. Hehe, I, Tiankui Star, will explore it today.</p><p></p><p>If there are treasures here, I absolutely cannot let the Silver Fox Clan hoard them.</p><p></p><p>Such good things must be brought out and shared with everyone."</p>

        <h1>Chapter 342</h1>
        <div class="content">
            <p>Here is the full English translation of the Chinese excerpt:</p><p></p><p>He walked into the library.</p><p></p><p>As he passed by, the expressions of all the people around him were very natural, without any strangeness.</p><p></p><p>He couldn't help but sneer inwardly, "A group of useless people, not one of them can see through my true appearance. They are the dregs of the dregs! I wonder what use it is for the Xuanyuan Clan to educate this group of waste who haven't even fully activated their divine blood!"</p><p></p><p>As he walked, he scanned the area with his spiritual power, examining many people, but ultimately found no information about the true identity of the Sword Immortal.</p><p></p><p>This made him somewhat irritated, and he couldn't help but curse inwardly, "This Sword Immortal is really too 'cowardly'!"</p><p></p><p>Among so many people, there wasn't a single one who knew his identity.</p><p></p><p>But there was no other choice, in order to find the Sword Immortal, he had to continue searching the records.</p><p></p><p>His spiritual power swept through, but there were no records he was looking for on the first floor.</p><p></p><p>He quickly went to the second floor, but just like the first floor, there were no answers he wanted to find here.</p><p></p><p>He continued scanning the consciousness of the people around him while also searching the surrounding materials.</p><p></p><p>But he also dared not be too reckless!</p><p></p><p>After all, there was a Emperor Realm expert guarding this martial arts library.</p><p></p><p>He had to be a little more cautious.</p><p></p><p>The reason he dared to use his spiritual power to scan was mainly because the cultivators here were generally of a lower level, with few Emperor Realm experts.</p><p></p><p>He soon arrived on the fourth floor.</p><p></p><p>There were already very few people on the fourth floor, and as he was about to spread out his spiritual power, he suddenly saw a figure.</p><p></p><p>A figure that was staring directly at him.</p><p></p><p>That figure was none other than Ye Xiao.</p><p></p><p>From the moment the other party entered the library, he had sensed it immediately, and also knew the identity hidden beneath his disguise.</p><p></p><p>A Winged Deity Clan! The strength of an Emperor Realm with a hundred and eight dragons, who knows how many times stronger than an ordinary Emperor Realm.</p><p></p><p>The perception ability was also extremely keen.</p><p></p><p>No matter how well the other party's disguise was done, he didn't even need to use his eyes, just a simple expansion of his perception, and he could instantly grasp the other party's origins.</p><p></p><p>That's why as soon as the Winged Deity Clan Emperor Realm expert arrived on the fourth floor, he had directly locked onto him.</p><p></p><p>The Winged Deity Clan Emperor Realm expert saw this scene and was immediately dumbfounded, not knowing what was going on? Was he discovered? How was that possible? His disguise technique was top-notch!</p><p></p><p>Even among the Winged Deity Clan, there were few who could see through it. He could say with 100% confidence that as long as he didn't reveal his aura, even if an Xuanyuan Clan Emperor Realm expert stood in front of him, face to face, they wouldn't be able to discover his identity.</p><p></p><p>Moreover, he also knew that the librarian guarding this martial arts library was a woman, and it absolutely couldn't be her.</p><p></p><p>The Xuanyuan Clan wouldn't have placed two Emperor Realm experts in a single library! So Ye Xiao shouldn't be an Emperor Realm expert! But how did this guy discover it? Could it be that he was looking at the things around him? Yes, it must be that.</p><p></p><p>Thinking of this, he immediately moved his feet inconspicuously.</p><p></p><p>However, the next moment, he was stunned again.</p><p></p><p>Because Ye Xiao's head didn't move, but his gaze was still fixed on him, following his movement with his eyes.</p><p></p><p>In an instant, his gaze became ice-cold.</p><p></p><p>He had actually been discovered, damn it! If that's the case, he absolutely couldn't let him go.</p><p></p><p>Thinking of this, he immediately unleashed his spiritual power, trying to shatter Ye Xiao's spiritual power and soul together.</p><p></p><p>Spiritual power was his most proficient attack method.</p><p></p><p>The next moment, the spiritual power surged like a tidal wave, frantically attacking Ye Xiao.</p><p></p><p>Boom! Thud! Thud thud thud... The Winged Deity Clan expert left peacefully, he never understood how he died.</p><p></p><p>Ye Xiao was just sitting there, not moving a muscle, not even releasing his spiritual power, there was no way he could have killed him, but he had still managed to do it.</p><p></p><p>In fact, Ye Xiao saw him attack and immediately activated his eye technique to attack.</p><p></p><p>Of course, he could also use spiritual power to attack.</p><p></p><p>Although his current cultivation of the spiritual system technique was the same as the other party, both being Emperor Realm level attacks, he had already cultivated to a hundred and eight dragons, while the other party was only a mere three dragons, a mere speck of dust before him.</p><p></p><p>However, using the eye technique was more convenient, allowing him to kill the other party silently and instantly.</p><p></p><p>Originally, if the other party hadn't attacked him, he might not have acted so quickly, at least not this fast.</p><p></p><p>But the other party attacked first, so there was no other choice, he had to send him on his way.</p><p></p><p>The Winged Deity Clan expert fell down the stairs, and the cultivators on the third floor rushed over to him.</p><p></p><p>"Quick, look, what happened to him?"</p><p></p><p>"Looks like he's dead, everyone don't touch anything, notify the defense team."</p><p></p><p>Before the words had even fallen, another shrill scream suddenly rang out.</p><p></p><p>"Ah! You guys, look, he's grown wings! He's not human, he's a celestial beast!"</p><p></p><p>"Idiot, he's not a celestial beast, he's from the Winged Deity Clan, the ancestors of the West!"</p><p></p><p>"Oh, I see, but why would he come to our place?"</p><p></p><p>Here is the full English translation of the Chinese excerpt:</p><p></p><p>"Enough with the nonsense, quickly report to the garrison troops, this matter is likely to be quite troublesome." </p><p></p><p>The crowd hurriedly used their spiritual stones to contact the nearby garrison troops to handle the matter.</p><p></p><p>Half an hour later, in the morgue of the garrison troops.</p><p></p><p>A man and a woman were intently staring at the corpse of the Winged Deity Tribe member on the table, deep in thought.</p><p></p><p>These two people were the current commander of the garrison troops, Xu Wuming, and the current director of the Martial Arts Library, Yao Meiqin. </p><p></p><p>Both of them were Empyrean realm experts from the Divine Wood Academy.</p><p></p><p>At this moment, the two of them were staring at the Winged Deity Tribe corpse in front of them, their brows furrowed into a "Â∑ù" shape.</p><p></p><p>"You said you didn't feel anything at the time?"</p><p></p><p>"That's right, I was cultivating in the office at the time and didn't feel any disturbances, in fact, if it wasn't for the garrison troops member coming to find me, I wouldn't have even known this had happened."</p><p></p><p>Xu Wuming's gaze was flickering with an unusual light.</p><p></p><p>"This Winged Deity Tribe member is at the Empyrean Realm Second Dragon level, you know what that means, right?"</p><p></p><p>Yao Meiqin nodded.</p><p></p><p>"On one hand, the fact that this Winged Deity Tribe member was able to infiltrate the Martial Arts Library without me noticing is quite impressive, and worthy of my vigilance. </p><p></p><p>On the other hand, the fact that he was able to instantly kill an Empyrean Realm Second Dragon expert without making a single sound, his strength is truly terrifying and chilling."</p><p></p><p>Even as Empyrean Realm experts, at this moment, when mentioning this matter, Yao Meiqin felt a chill down her spine, and the hairs on her body couldn't help but stand on end.</p><p></p><p>The other party's strength was unknown, but it was likely dozens of times greater than theirs, at least in the Empyrean Realm Sixty-Four Dragon level! However, the strongest expert sent by the Xuanyuan Deity Tribe this time was only the one from the Divine Tiger Gate, at the Empyrean Realm Sixty-Four Dragon level.</p><p></p><p>The Divine Wood Academy's strongest was only at the Empyrean Realm Forty-Seven Dragon level.</p><p></p><p>Just who is this person? So monstrous?</p><p></p><p>"I've looked into some information before, and that Sword Immortal has appeared the most in the Jianghai City area."</p><p></p><p>Yao Meiqin's breathing became a bit rapid, her chest heaving up and down.</p><p></p><p>"Are you saying that he is in Jianghai City? And that he was in the library today?"</p><p></p><p>"I'm just saying that's a possibility. If his strength is truly that powerful, even if he's not in the library, he could instantly kill the opponent."</p><p></p><p>"Sss!" </p><p></p><p>Yao Meiqin couldn't help but shiver, taking a deep breath, her gaze becoming somewhat fearful.</p><p></p><p>"To think that in this small, remote human realm, there would appear an existence that makes us all feel such terror. It's truly terrifying!"</p><p></p><p>"That Xuanyuan Deity Tribe elder from back then, although not too famous in the Xuanyuan Deity Tribe, was still somewhat well-known. It's understandable that a powerful expert would appear among his descendants.</p><p></p><p>However, this is also good news for us, at least now we can roughly determine that this so-called Sword Immortal is in Jianghai City, and not somewhere else.</p><p></p><p>For us, this is already very good news.</p><p></p><p>We must find him and persuade him to join the Divine Wood Academy, he is crucial to the Divine Wood Academy."</p><p></p><p>Yao Meiqin was shocked again: "I admit his strength is powerful, but his strength is only powerful compared to us. In the Divine Wood Academy, there are many Empyrean Realm peak experts, he shouldn't be as exaggerated as you say, right?"</p><p></p><p>Xu Guangnian smiled.</p><p></p><p>"Do you know why this time, our Divine Wood Academy sent people to this world? And why the investment in Jianghai City far exceeds that of other sects?"</p><p></p><p>Yao Meiqin shook her head.</p><p></p><p>Xu Guangnian spoke again:</p><p></p><p>"Have you heard of a name?"</p><p></p><p>"What name?"</p><p></p><p>"Ancestor Dragon!"</p><p></p><p>Boom! As soon as this name was mentioned, Yao Meiqin felt her mind being violently shaken.</p><p></p><p>That name was a legend from more than two thousand years ago! He had once represented another rising point for the Xuanyuan Deity Tribe.</p><p></p><p>The Xuanyuan Deity Tribe had once almost fallen out of the top twenty rankings of the starry sky tribes.</p><p></p><p>It was precisely because of that man's appearance that the Xuanyuan Deity Tribe was able to remain firmly in the nineteenth position.</p><p></p><p>"But... what does Ancestor Dragon have to do with this place?"</p><p></p><p>As soon as she finished speaking, her expression changed again, her body trembling slightly.</p><p></p><p>"You... you don't mean to say that this place is that person's hometown, right?"</p><p></p><p>Xu Guangnian nodded with a faint smile.</p><p></p><p>"For all these years, all the forces of the Xuanyuan Deity Tribe have been searching for Ancestor Dragon's hometown, hoping to find people with the same bloodline as him.</p><p></p><p>This is also why the Xuanyuan Tribe Leader has established a tribal rule over the years, that no matter who encounters the Xuanyuan bloodline seeking help in other small worlds, they must rescue them in time.</p><p></p><p>The Xuanyuan Deity Tribe wants to create another existence on par with Ancestor Dragon!"</p>

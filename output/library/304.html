        <h1>Chapter 304</h1>
        <div class="content">
            <p>Here is the full English translation of the Chinese excerpt:</p><p></p><p>"Oh? More companions have arrived? Which divine lord are you from?"</p><p></p><p>"You all should be more familiar with them than I am."</p><p></p><p>The next moment, Ye Xiao released all the dozen-plus star beasts he had captured.</p><p></p><p>Among them were several star beasts at the divine beast realm, as well as some of their subordinate divine lord star beasts.</p><p></p><p>Ye Xiao now only paid attention to those above the divine lord realm, not even glancing at those below.</p><p></p><p>Because they were of no great use.</p><p></p><p>Only the star beasts above the divine lord realm could provide him with a certain amount of vital energy.</p><p></p><p>Furthermore, only the meat of star beasts at that level could satisfy his requirements in terms of taste and texture.</p><p></p><p>"I'll leave them here first. You all are responsible for teaching them the rules of this place. I hope to see their offerings by tomorrow morning.</p><p></p><p>If you make things easy for me, I'll give you some extra rewards."</p><p></p><p>With that, he once again activated the Yin-Yang Escape Technique and disappeared from the spot, leaving the other star beasts completely dumbfounded.</p><p></p><p>What was going on? Had Ye Xiao raided a star beast's lair in the Star Battlefield?</p><p></p><p>All the star beasts he had brought out were above the divine lord realm, with a few even at the divine beast realm.</p><p></p><p>Even the Swallow Moon Mastiff and Burial Dragon, which had been crushed by Ye Xiao's aura, had been revived and brought here.</p><p></p><p>Wasn't this just bullying?</p><p></p><p>The star beasts were almost petrified.</p><p></p><p>"If I'm not mistaken, that fellow should be the 131st ranked Qingbird Jade Wuji on the Star Ranking."</p><p></p><p>"Not just him, the 114th ranked Iron Rhino is here too."</p><p></p><p>"Several other well-known seniors on the Star Ranking are also present."</p><p></p><p>"Could it be that he really went to the upper Star Realm and raided a star beast's lair?"</p><p></p><p>"Wait, I feel like everyone's focus is in the wrong place. With his strength, capturing divine beast realm star beasts is nothing extraordinary. There's no need to be so shocked."</p><p></p><p>"That's right, I think the last thing he said is quite attractive. As long as we can persuade these fellows to obediently offer their tributes, we'll get rewards!"</p><p></p><p>"Yeah, yeah, maybe there will be spiritual herbs, or even a vacation."</p><p></p><p>The star beasts: "()!"</p><p></p><p>Soon, the other star beasts gradually regained their senses and slowly got up from the ground.</p><p></p><p>"Where is this place? How did we end up here?"</p><p></p><p>Feng Long immediately explained:</p><p></p><p>"Esteemed seniors, this is Mr. Ye Xiao's star beast breeding farm. Welcome to your new home!"</p><p></p><p>Hearing this, Jade Wuji and a few other star beasts' faces instantly darkened.</p><p></p><p>"What is a star beast breeding farm?"</p><p></p><p>Sameul hurriedly said:</p><p></p><p>"It means they'll treat us like poultry and livestock, making us provide a certain amount of blood, meat, or even eggs every day."</p><p></p><p>Upon hearing this, Jade Wuji and the other star beasts couldn't help but twitch their faces in disgust.</p><p></p><p>Poultry? Livestock?</p><p></p><p>What the hell? </p><p></p><p>Making them, the mighty divine beast realm star beasts, into poultry and livestock? Even if this guy was an Emperor Realm expert, he couldn't be so outrageous, right?</p><p></p><p>He could kill them, but he absolutely couldn't trample on their dignity like this.</p><p></p><p>This was a serious insult to their status as divine lord class star beasts!</p><p></p><p>"If we don't want to, will he choose to kill us?"</p><p></p><p>The star beasts suddenly revealed a rather pitiful expression.</p><p></p><p>"We advise you not to do that."</p><p></p><p>"Yes, because offending him will only lead to a fate worse than death, and you won't even be able to die."</p><p></p><p>"He has Emperor Realm level healing arts, so as long as your soul doesn't instantly perish, he can revive you completely."</p><p></p><p>"And even if you really refuse, he'll just forcibly harvest your flesh and then heal you."</p><p></p><p>After saying this, someone pointed to the distant Quaking Star Tiger.</p><p></p><p>Seeing the Quaking Star Tiger, Jade Wuji and the others completely collapsed.</p><p></p><p>The Quaking Star Tiger was a top 100 existence, far stronger than them.</p><p></p><p>Even such a powerful star beast had been captured and brought here.</p><p></p><p>Did that mean that even death was a luxury here? Noel Fis tried to persuade them: "Actually, you don't have to be so pessimistic. As long as you let go of your pride, life here can still be quite comfortable."</p><p></p><p>"That's right, just provide a fixed amount of flesh daily, and the rest of the time is leisure. </p><p></p><p>"The more you provide, the more spiritual herbs you'll get to distribute. More work, more pay! And they're all good stuff. Look at us, we're just playing games all day."</p><p></p><p>"Anyway, you can't defeat him in a fight, and you can't escape either. It's better to just accept your fate here. At least you won't accumulate too much karmic sin, and you can still cultivate."</p><p></p><p>Jade Wuji and the others were moved.</p><p></p><p>So it's all good stuff? And they can live such a carefree life? It seems this so-called poultry and livestock thing isn't that bad after all.</p><p></p><p>Because they had all personally experienced Ye Xiao's terrifying strength.</p><p></p><p>In fact, they understood Ye Xiao's power even better than these cowering star beasts.</p><p></p><p>They knew that Ye Xiao was a legendary Emperor Realm expert.</p><p></p><p>Serving as poultry and livestock for an Emperor Realm expert doesn't seem that humiliating, after all.</p><p></p><p>However, they weren't fools either. At the very least, they wanted to take a look at what these "good things" were tomorrow before deciding.</p><p></p><p>Here is the full English translation of the Chinese excerpt:</p><p></p><p>Should we raise poultry for Ye Xiao?</p><p></p><p>On Ye Xiao's side, after returning home, Huan Liuli was lying on the sofa, fast asleep, still holding a chicken wing that had been gnawed clean. It seemed that it was one of those star beasts, used to exchange for mahjong.</p><p></p><p>Ye Xiao carefully scanned the area, and suddenly discovered a pleasant surprise.</p><p></p><p>Huan Liuli's cultivation had once again improved.</p><p></p><p>She was now at the Innate Ninth-Grade Saint Sect cultivation level.</p><p></p><p>Normally speaking, before he left, she was still at the Innate Seventh-Grade, and it was just today that he left, so it was impossible for her to suddenly increase to such a powerful level just by doing some small business and exchanging for a bit of star beast blood and flesh.</p><p></p><p>To break through two realms in one go.</p><p></p><p>No, there must be something wrong somewhere.</p><p></p><p>It must be because of his own breakthrough!</p><p></p><p>Ye Xiao suddenly understood, it was because of his own breakthrough.</p><p></p><p>The books recorded that if a person breaks through to the Emperor Realm, the strength of his blood relatives, as well as the contracted spirit pets, will greatly increase.</p><p></p><p>Could it be because of this?</p><p></p><p>However, this is not a bad thing, at least the stronger Huan Liuli becomes, the more useful she will be to him. If she was too weak, over time, he might not be able to use her anymore.</p><p></p><p>At this moment, Huan Liuli rolled over.</p><p></p><p>Ye Xiao: "Σ(°△°|||)!"</p><p></p><p>This damn cat, does she think she can just wear less clothes when she's home alone?</p><p></p><p>Bastard!</p><p></p><p>It seems that tomorrow he will need to have a good "discussion" with her, to let her know a little about the rules.</p><p></p><p>Time passed quickly, and in the blink of an eye, it was the next day.</p><p></p><p>Early the next morning, Jiang Chen came and waited in front of Ye Xiao's door.</p><p></p><p>Although a powerful warrior like him would not have dark circles under his eyes from staying up all night, Ye Xiao could still see that he had not slept at all the entire night.</p><p></p><p>It must have been difficult for him, as he was the first to know such a big news, and then rushed to notify all the other races.</p><p></p><p>Ye Xiao didn't keep him waiting long, and directly sent him a mental message, inviting him into the courtyard.</p><p></p><p>The Xuanwu Venerable arrived at Ye Xiao's house, and Huan Liuli had just finished preparing breakfast and placed it on the table.</p><p></p><p>Ye Xiao smiled and said, "It's better to come at the right time than too early. Why don't you join us for breakfast as well?"</p><p></p><p>Jiang Chen was about to jump up.</p><p></p><p>"What time is it now? And you still have the heart to eat breakfast here?"</p><p></p><p>"Even if the world is about to end tomorrow, what's meant to come will come. Thinking too much about it is useless."</p><p></p><p>Jiang Chen gave a bitter smile.</p><p></p><p>"Your state of mind is really admirable, I'm far from being able to match you.</p><p></p><p>The Azure Dragon learned that the beast disaster was coming early, so he immediately sent me to contact you! He wants to have a decisive battle with you today. He wants to pass his Dao Realm to you.</p><p></p><p>Now, he's already in the deep mountains south of the Jianghai City, waiting for you."</p><p></p><p>Ye Xiao smiled, and Huan Liuli served Jiang Chen a set of bowls and chopsticks. Jiang Chen casually picked up a piece of breakfast meat and started eating, while speaking:</p><p></p><p>"I really don't have the appetite to eat right now. My mind is full of these matters. Huh?"</p><p></p><p>Before he could finish speaking, the next second he was dumbfounded.</p><p></p><p>What's going on? How can this meat have such powerful spiritual energy and blood qi? You've got to be kidding me?</p><p></p><p>This scale of blood qi and spiritual energy is undoubtedly that of a divine beast.</p><p></p><p>Does this guy Ye Xiao actually start raising divine beasts now?</p><p></p><p>Ye Xiao smiled slightly.</p><p></p><p>"I just caught these a few days ago, how's the taste? Should be pretty good, right?"</p><p></p><p>Jiang Chen's mouth corner couldn't help but twitch violently.</p><p></p><p>Divine beast meat, and you say it's just "pretty good"? This is beyond just "pretty good"!</p><p></p><p>This is simply unbelievable! No one in the world eats like Ye Xiao! Even the Emperors on the Star Battlefield may occasionally eat their own spoils of war, but definitely not every spoil being a divine beast-level star beast.</p><p></p><p>But Ye Xiao is different, he directly raises a few of them, and can eat fresh star beast meat every day.</p><p></p><p>This guy, if he doesn't improve his own strength, whose strength will improve?</p><p></p><p>Seeing Jiang Chen also start to enjoy the meal heartily, Ye Xiao laughed.</p><p></p><p>"Don't eat so hurriedly, be careful of choking. There's more if it's not enough."</p><p></p><p>Jiang Chen waved his hand, gulping down several pieces of divine beast meat in a rush.</p><p></p><p>"I can't eat anymore today, hurry, let's go! The Azure Dragon is already waiting for you. This is a rare chance for you to break through to the Emperor Realm, you absolutely can't miss it."</p><p></p><p>But Ye Xiao did not seem to have any intention of moving.</p><p></p><p>He took a small red flower from the vase on the table and handed it to Jiang Chen.</p><p></p><p>"I won't go, you help me give this small red flower to him, and he'll understand when he sees it."</p><p></p><p>Jiang Chen was stunned for a moment, then became a bit anxious.</p><p></p><p>"Are you joking with me? This is a rare chance for you to ascend to the Emperor Realm, and you're not going to go learn from the Azure Dragon, and just want me to send a small red flower?"</p>

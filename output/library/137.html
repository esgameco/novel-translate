        <h1>Chapter 137</h1>
        <div class="content">
            <p>Here is the full English translation of the Chinese excerpt:</p><p></p><p>"Alright, the specific assessment and admission rules will be sent to your phones shortly.</p><p></p><p>The assessment will start tomorrow. If there are no issues, then we can adjourn the meeting. I hope everyone goes back and prepares well today."</p><p></p><p>Ouyang Yunzhong announced the end of the meeting, and everyone returned to their respective positions.</p><p></p><p>Ye Xiao heard his subordinates quietly discussing how to send gifts to Ouyang Yunzhong to keep their jobs.</p><p></p><p>"My dad's second aunt's third uncle's great-grandson's ex-girlfriend's uncle is a distant relative of Director Ouyang. I should go see if I can find some clues and have him help me out."</p><p></p><p>"What does a distant relative matter? I'll tell you, in terms of relationship seniority, I should be calling Director Ouyang 'Great-Grandma'!"</p><p></p><p>"Damn, your relationship with Director Ouyang is that close?"</p><p></p><p>"Of course, Director Ouyang and my great-grandma are from the same village."</p><p></p><p>"Wow, I thought you meant your actual great-grandma, not just someone from the same village. What nonsense is this?"</p><p></p><p>Ye Xiao felt extremely speechless at their exchange. These guys were thinking too simply.</p><p></p><p>If the library was to be expanded, this time it was very likely that a super-large library would be built. </p><p></p><p>Director Ouyang's cultivation was only at the Innate First-Grade Grandmaster realm. After the expansion, whether she could remain as the director was still questionable.</p><p></p><p>Moreover, Director Ouyang's age was also approaching retirement, as she was already over 90 years old. It was only because of her cultivation in the martial dao that she still looked young. But previously, the library only managed the martial arts scriptures of a small coastal city. In the future, it would no longer be just that one city.</p><p></p><p>However, Ye Xiao was not worried.</p><p></p><p>Obstacles can be overcome, and problems can be solved.</p><p></p><p>According to the assessment standards sent to his phone, the minimum requirement was Third-Grade martial dao cultivation. But based on Ye Xiao's judgment, this was actually risky.</p><p></p><p>Because even if the majority couldn't rely on connections, there would still be a small number of people who could obtain a few spots through connections. With fewer spots available, the admission threshold would naturally be raised slightly.</p><p></p><p>However, Ye Xiao knew that two of his colleagues were preparing to go back home and start their own businesses.</p><p></p><p>As long as he could demonstrate Third-Grade martial dao cultivation, he should still be able to pass.</p><p></p><p>As for the written test, even without looking at the standards, he was not worried.</p><p></p><p>With his performance in the library, he could easily handle it.</p><p></p><p>Of course, even if he couldn't become a librarian, it wouldn't matter.</p><p></p><p>He could still come here to read books and earn some living expenses through alchemy.</p><p></p><p>But there were two downsides to that.</p><p></p><p>One was that as a librarian, he could read books for free, receive a monthly salary, and enjoy various employee benefits.</p><p>While reading books as a regular visitor would cost money, require a membership card, and have various rules and regulations, which he found troublesome.</p><p></p><p>Ye Xiao didn't care about money, but he disliked trouble. Being a manager would save him a lot of hassle.</p><p></p><p>The other, and most important, reason was that as a librarian, he could use the excuse of being bored at work to spend time reading books.</p><p></p><p>If he was no longer a librarian and didn't have a job, spending all day in the library reading books would definitely raise suspicions.</p><p></p><p>Before his cultivation reached a satisfactory level, he didn't want to draw too much attention to himself and have his abilities discovered.</p><p></p><p>The morning passed quickly, and it was time to get off work.</p><p></p><p>Ye Xiao went to the employee cafeteria, ordered a potato and beef stew set, and found a corner seat by the window to eat.</p><p></p><p>Soon, a figure sat down across from him, accompanied by a refreshing fragrance. Even without looking up, just seeing the stockinged feet and high heels under the table, he could guess who it was - Wang Na.</p><p></p><p>"Little Ye Xiao, is it okay if I sit here, sister?"</p><p></p><p>Ye Xiao just nodded slightly.</p><p></p><p>After reforming, Wang Na had become much more normal. Her clothes were more proper, her makeup less seductive, and even the perfume she wore was a light, fresh scent instead of the overpowering type.</p><p></p><p>"Then I won't be polite." Wang Na placed her tray down, adjusted her chopsticks, and started eating while chatting. "What are your thoughts on this assessment?"</p><p></p><p>"What thoughts can I have? Just go with the flow. If I can pass, great. If not, oh well."</p><p></p><p>"Do you want your sister to use some connections to help you out?"</p><p></p><p>Ye Xiao couldn't help but be curious.</p><p></p><p>"Didn't you already find a boyfriend? How come you still have so many people backing you up?"</p><p></p><p>Wang Na gave Ye Xiao a look.</p><p></p><p>"Don't you know that men are all scoundrels? If I didn't have a boyfriend, they might all be flirting with me. But now that I have a boyfriend, they're like bees drawn to honey, their eyes shining brightly."</p><p></p><p>"Then how many hats does your boyfriend have to wear? You should stop harming him."</p><p></p><p>"Screw you!" Wang Na pouted playfully, not really angry.</p><p></p><p>"Your sister is now a proper housewife. Except for my boyfriend, no one else can touch me. I'm telling you seriously, everyone is sending gifts, so if you need any help with that, just let me know. </p><p>I've been here for 20 years and can still find some connections."</p><p></p><p>"No need."</p><p></p><p>"Really? Your cultivation is only at Second-Grade Posterior Sky, right? This..."</p><p></p><p>Here is the full English translation of the Chinese novel excerpt:</p><p></p><p>Ye Xiao shrugged. "It doesn't matter, it's not like I'll starve to death if I leave the library."</p><p></p><p>Wang Na looked at Ye Xiao with a slightly dazed expression.</p><p></p><p>"Xiao Ye, you know? Your calm and mature demeanor, combined with your looks, is incredibly attractive to women. </p><p></p><p>If you were a scumbag, every woman in Jianghai City, from a hundred-year-old grandma to an unborn baby, wouldn't be able to escape your grasp."</p><p></p><p>Ye Xiao didn't say anything, just lowered his head and continued eating in silence.</p><p></p><p>Seeing that he didn't continue the conversation, Wang Na didn't pursue it further.</p><p></p><p>The reason she helped Ye Xiao was purely because she felt he was a good person who had enlightened her.</p><p></p><p>After going through twists and turns, she had finally come to her senses and found her own happiness.</p><p></p><p>But since Ye Xiao didn't need her help, she let it be.</p><p></p><p>After finishing the meal, Ye Xiao went back to work in the afternoon to read books.</p><p></p><p>In the afternoon, Gu Hai also called.</p><p></p><p>Since he had previously worked at the library, he was still in the colleague group chat and could get some information from his friends' circles.</p><p></p><p>The call was essentially about whether he should try to find connections to see if he could keep his job.</p><p></p><p>After all, working at the library in Jianghai City was indeed a coveted position. It didn't require hard labor, the salary was appropriate, and there were various benefits.</p><p></p><p>Ye Xiao still refused.</p><p></p><p>After a brief conversation, they hung up the phone.</p><p></p><p>When Ye Xiao got off work and returned home in the evening, he saw Ouyang Yunzhong getting into a car at the entrance.</p><p></p><p>He knew it was the city lord's private car.</p><p></p><p>It seems that the changes in the library this time were indeed extraordinary.</p><p></p><p>Perhaps they would introduce a lot of good books.</p><p></p><p>It looks like he could learn more types of cultivation techniques in the future and synthesize even more powerful imperial arts!</p><p></p><p>Ouyang Yunzhong got into the city lord's private car and went straight to the city lord's mansion, where he met with City Lord Tian Yu and others for a discussion.</p><p></p><p>Also present were Qin Shenglong and Nangong Ling.</p><p></p><p>Seeing Ouyang Yunzhong arrive, the others greeted her, and then the formal meeting began.</p><p></p><p>"Next, I'd like to share with you the instructions regarding Jingzhou and Zhongzhou," City Lord Tian Yu said, holding a document in his hand.</p><p></p><p>"This time, the Seven Star Convergence has caused considerable losses to the entire world. It can be foreseen that the star beasts are becoming increasingly powerful.</p><p></p><p>In order to reduce risk and better respond to the star beasts, better protect the human race's fire, and ensure its continued prosperity,</p><p></p><p>the requirement to integrate the cities has been made.</p><p></p><p>Based on the currently better cities, priority will be given to allocating resources, attracting talents, and forming large cities to gather martial artists.</p><p></p><p>This way, when facing star beast invasions, we can better utilize the strength of human martial artists to resist them."</p><p></p><p>After glancing at the group, Tian Yu continued, "First, the position of city lord will still be held by me.</p><p></p><p>Secondly, the former dean of the Jianghai City Martial Arts Academy, Qin Shenglong, will step down from the dean's position, and my uncle, Tian Longfeng, will take over."</p><p></p><p>Qin Shenglong was very accepting of this decision. After all, Tian Longfeng was a grand master, much stronger than him, and had previously been a renowned professor at the Jingdu Martial Arts Academy, with superior teaching abilities.</p><p></p><p>"Old Qin, do you have any thoughts on this?" Tian Longfeng, who cared about his old friend's opinion, asked.</p><p></p><p>Qin Shenglong shook his head.</p><p></p><p>"I have no objections. If you hadn't left back then, this dean's position would have been yours anyway.</p><p></p><p>Now it's just returning to its rightful owner.</p><p></p><p>And I hear the star beast battlefields are very tense now.</p><p></p><p>My old bones are reaching their limit, and I'm thinking of going to the star beast battlefields to try my luck, see if I can make a breakthrough."</p><p></p><p>Seeing that Qin Shenglong had no objections, Tian Yu continued, "The former commander-in-chief of the defense force, Nangong Ling, will now serve as the deputy commander-in-chief. Zhongzhou will send a grand master to take over the position.</p><p></p><p>Nangong Ling will assist him in his work."</p><p></p><p>Nangong Ling nodded. With Jianghai City expanding, he would be somewhat overwhelmed if he continued to control the defense force alone.</p><p></p><p>"The director of the Jianghai City Library, Ouyang Yunzhong, will step down from the director's position, and Zhongzhou will also send a grand master to take over.</p><p></p><p>Director Ouyang, do you have any objections?"</p><p></p><p>Ouyang Yunzhong nodded.</p><p></p><p>"I'm old, it's time for me to go back and take care of my grandchildren. Stepping down is just right."</p><p></p><p>"Okay, since everyone has no objections, then let's decide on this. I hope everyone can understand that the main purpose is to make our Jianghai City better.</p><p></p><p>After Jianghai City expands, it will absorb the surrounding cities, gradually develop and grow stronger, so as to better cope with the beast disaster in four years!"</p>

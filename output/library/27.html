        <h1>Chapter 27</h1>
        <div class="content">
            <p>Here is the full English translation of the Chinese excerpt:</p><p></p><p>"Yuyan, which top-tier academy are you planning to attend?" </p><p></p><p>Qin Shenglong couldn't help but ask.</p><p></p><p>He wanted to know his granddaughter's thoughts in advance, so that he could make the necessary arrangements if someone called.</p><p></p><p>But Qin Yuyan remained silent.</p><p></p><p>"Grandpa, I... I don't want to leave Jianghai City."</p><p></p><p>"What? You don't want to leave Jianghai City? This is a rare and golden opportunity! You..."</p><p></p><p>Qin Shenglong wanted to say more, but Dou Changfeng interjected to persuade him:</p><p></p><p>"Old Qin, I also think it's best for Yuyan to stay in Jianghai City. </p><p></p><p>Firstly, she has not fully digested that sword intent yet, and even if she goes to a top-tier academy, the knowledge she gains there may not be as substantial as that sword intent.</p><p></p><p>Secondly, if that eminent person is still in Jianghai City, and Yuyan encounters him again, it would be a heavenly blessing for her."</p><p></p><p>Qin Shenglong nodded.</p><p></p><p>"You're right, I didn't consider that thoroughly enough. Yuyan, from now on, you can cultivate however you wish, and I won't interfere at all."</p><p></p><p>On the other side, Park Jiansheng had just walked out of the Jianghai Martial Arts Academy. Jin Changlang's gloomy mood had been completely lifted.</p><p></p><p>"Fortunately, you won this time. If you had lost, I would have had to bear a lot of responsibility when I went back.</p><p></p><p>But then again, you were too reckless this time. If that Qin fellow had tricked you and you had practiced the sword art for a few more years, you might have failed.</p><p></p><p>In the future, you absolutely cannot do something like this again."</p><p></p><p>"I understand."</p><p></p><p>"Is your injury not serious?"</p><p></p><p>"It's nothing, just a slight shock. It will heal by the time we reach the next city."</p><p></p><p>"Then I'll go book the train tickets right away. The high-speed rail in the Nine Provinces is world-renowned, so we don't need to take a plane for travel between small cities."</p><p></p><p>Park Jiansheng nodded, and the two did not take a taxi, but instead proceeded on foot.</p><p></p><p>The speed of martial artists is already quite high, so walking occasionally is fine.</p><p></p><p>As they crossed the bridge and arrived at the center of Jianghai City, just as they reached a roundabout, Park Jiansheng suddenly stopped in his tracks.</p><p></p><p>"What's wrong?"</p><p></p><p>Jin Changlang couldn't help but frown.</p><p></p><p>But Park Jiansheng's expression was extremely grave. </p><p></p><p>He seemed to have not heard Jin Changlang's words at all, and slowly walked towards the golden ox statue on the roundabout.</p><p></p><p>"Park Jiansheng, what are you doing?"</p><p></p><p>Jin Changlang called out, but Park Jiansheng was like a lost soul, completely ignoring him.</p><p></p><p>And with each step he took, getting closer to the golden ox statue, his body began to tremble more and more.</p><p></p><p>When he reached the edge of the golden ox statue, he stared fixatedly at the sword marks on it, and suddenly coughed up a mouthful of fresh blood, dropping to his knees.</p><p></p><p>"Jiansheng!"</p><p></p><p>Jin Changlang's face changed drastically, and he immediately rushed over, placing his hand on Park Jiansheng's shoulder.</p><p></p><p>"Are you alright? What happened? Was it from the battle just now? Did you sustain internal injuries?"</p><p></p><p>Park Jiansheng still did not directly answer him, but instead raised his hands high, laughing maniacally as he exclaimed, "I've found it! I've found it! The essence of the sword art! Master was right, the supreme sword arts come from the Nine Provinces, and the supreme martial arts come from the Nine Provinces as well! Haha..."</p><p></p><p>Back at the Jianghai Martial Arts Academy, Qin Shenglong and Dou Changfeng, who were happy for Qin Yuyan, suddenly received a message from the Jianghai Defense Force.</p><p></p><p>Qin Shenglong's expression became rather strange.</p><p></p><p>"Old Dou, it's about that Park Jiansheng. It seems he has gone mad."</p><p></p><p>"Mad? What happened?"</p><p></p><p>"I don't know, but I heard he..."</p><p></p><p>Here is the full English translation of the Chinese excerpt:</p><p></p><p>"He was just sitting at a roundabout intersection in our Jiangcheng and refused to leave. The citizens reported it, and Captain Jin exposed him, so they called over.</p><p></p><p>Dou Changfeng's expression was somewhat grave.</p><p></p><p>"We'd better go take a look quickly. No matter what, he is also a person from Hanzhou, and it involves diplomacy, so we can't be careless."</p><p></p><p>Qin Shenglong nodded, and the three of them quickly followed.</p><p></p><p>With Dou Changfeng as the leader, and Qin Shenglong as a natural grandmaster, their speed was naturally not a concern. In less than two minutes, they had arrived at the roundabout intersection.</p><p></p><p>From a distance, they could hear Captain Jin's roar, and there were many citizens surrounding the area, pointing and discussing, not knowing what was going on.</p><p></p><p>"Are you crazy? You want to cultivate here? What about the Nine States Sword Dao challenge? What are you going to do when your master asks about it?"</p><p></p><p>The three of them crossed the crowd and came to the edge of the roundabout flower bed.</p><p></p><p>They saw Park Jeongsaeng sitting cross-legged in front of the golden bull on the flower bed, staring intently at the sword mark on the golden bull.</p><p></p><p>Captain Jin was constantly berating him next to him, and there were a few members of the defense team, all with a helpless expression.</p><p></p><p>"My goodness! This sword technique is incredible!"</p><p></p><p>Qin Shenglong and Dou Changfeng, upon arriving, merely glanced at it and their pupils immediately constricted, their breathing momentarily stilled.</p><p></p><p>All the hairs on their bodies began to stand on end.</p><p></p><p>Although Qin Yuyan no longer cultivated the sword dao, she had once practiced it, so even though she could not see the profundity of it like her grandfather, she could still feel a sense of shock that made her scalp tingle.</p><p></p><p>This sword strike, although the sword mark was faint, the effect it produced was far less than the previous senior swordsman's stroke on the surface of the river, but the sword intent within it was no weaker than that sword intent.</p><p></p><p>Because Qin Yuyan's mind still contained a trace of sword intent, she could more intuitively compare the difference between the two, which was almost negligible! Jianghai City actually had another sword dao grandmaster! And this sword dao grandmaster was not at all weaker than that previous sword technique grandmaster!</p><p></p><p>At this time, a member of the defense team approached.</p><p></p><p>"President Qin, take a look at this matter."</p><p></p><p>"Let me handle it. You all disperse the onlookers to avoid congestion."</p><p></p><p>"Yes."</p><p></p><p>The members of the defense team quickly dispersed the crowd of onlookers.</p><p></p><p>Qin Shenglong and the others jumped onto the roundabout flower bed and approached Park Jeongsaeng.</p><p></p><p>"Park Jeongsaeng, how did you discover this sword technique?"</p><p></p><p>Park Jeongsaeng finally seemed to emerge from his meditation, turning to look at the three of them.</p><p></p><p>"I accidentally saw it. I was preparing to cultivate in Jianghai City, and when I finally comprehend this sword intent, I will leave. President Qin, this shouldn't be against the rules, right?"</p><p></p><p>"This..."</p><p></p><p>Qin Shenglong raised his eyebrows slightly, then nodded.</p><p></p><p>He had nothing to say. Although this sword mark was very powerful and belonged to the Nine States, there was no law prohibiting someone from looking at it.</p><p></p><p>After all, this was not some Nine States secret! And to be honest, even he himself wanted to take this bull back and look at it every day!</p><p></p><p>This previous sword dao grandmaster was too powerful! So powerful that even a genius like Park Jeongsaeng was in awe of him!</p><p></p><p>Captain Jin's eyes lit up. Just now, Park Jeongsaeng had ignored him the whole time, so he didn't know why Park Jeongsaeng was doing this. Now he seemed to have figured it out - the sword mark on this golden bull must be an extremely precious thing, carrying sword intent!</p><p></p><p>"Ahem." He cleared his throat and then spoke:</p><p></p><p>"President Qin, how about this, can you help us buy this golden bull? We are willing to spend any amount of money."</p><p></p><p>(This is the end of the second update, the new book is seeking support.)</p><p></p><p>(Thank you to the reader Juicy Orange 2017 for the donation, greatly appreciated.)</p>

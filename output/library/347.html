        <h1>Chapter 347</h1>
        <div class="content">
            <p>Here is the full English translation of the Chinese excerpt:</p><p></p><p>"Ye Xiao, where is your dragon qi that protects your body? Let me take a look."</p><p></p><p>The Emperor seemed to want to verify it once more, and Ye Xiao shrugged his shoulders.</p><p></p><p>"It's all gone. I've used it all to temper my divine soul."</p><p></p><p>The Emperor was curious.</p><p></p><p>"It's all been used to temper your divine soul? Has your divine soul been completely tempered? Why haven't you broken through to the legendary divine realm yet?"</p><p></p><p>Ye Xiao was puzzled. "I'm also very puzzled. That's why I wanted to find you, to see if we can find some ruins of divine realm experts and look for some methods and clues."</p><p></p><p>"I see. Well, the experts of the XuanYuan Clan have basically all gone to the starry sky to fight against the three major divine clans. This is a good opportunity for us to go to the ancestral tomb."</p><p></p><p>"Okay!"</p><p></p><p>After making the agreement, the three of them quickly followed the Emperor to the area under Kunlun Mountain in the west of the Nine Provinces.</p><p></p><p>From afar, Kunlun Mountain stood like a towering pillar, stretching from the ground and piercing into the clouds, with its peak disappearing deep into the mist. Common people could only see the faint mist and the vanishing mountain top.</p><p></p><p>The awe-inspiring sight was self-evident, making people shiver and their hairs stand on end.</p><p></p><p>"This is Kunlun Mountain. By the way, our ancestors once said that the treasure is related to the Kunlun Dragon Vein. Could the Kunlun Dragon Vein be around Kunlun Mountain?"</p><p></p><p>The Emperor shook his head. "I'm not very clear about this. But our past Emperors have all come here to search, yet no one has found the Kunlun Dragon Vein. Moreover, we have never been able to enter our ancestors' tomb. So we naturally have no way of knowing the whereabouts of the Kunlun Dragon Vein."</p><p></p><p>Ye Xiao nodded. "I see."</p><p></p><p>After arriving at Kunlun Mountain, they followed the Emperor's guidance to a secluded mountain stream. This mountain stream was very hidden and inconspicuous, even a bit desolate. To put it bluntly, even wild beasts would not linger here for long.</p><p></p><p>The Emperor seemed to have noticed the puzzlement in Ye Xiao's eyes and couldn't help but explain:</p><p></p><p>"The reason our ancestor placed the tomb here is to avoid the eyes of others, so that even if the human race is really at a dead end and has to summon the XuanYuan Clan in the future, his secret can be better protected and not easily discovered."</p><p></p><p>A hint of admiration flashed in Ye Xiao's eyes. To be honest, this was the only thing Ye Xiao had ever respected about the human race's ancestors.</p><p></p><p>That is, to 'hide'! Hiding his own body here, even if the XuanYuan Clan comes in the future and wants to find him and take away the secrets of this world, it would not be that easy.</p><p></p><p>This way, he has also left a card for his descendants.</p><p></p><p>The Emperor knelt down in front of the mountain stream and paid his respects.</p><p></p><p>"The unworthy descendant Zhu Qiyu, today brings the human race's descendant Ye Xiao and the Azure Dragon, to pay respects to our ancestor. I hope the ancestor will not be offended."</p><p></p><p>With that, he took a drop of blood from his finger and dripped it into the small stream. The stream immediately stopped flowing and completely dried up, revealing a void gate.</p><p></p><p>"Let's go, let's all go in."</p><p></p><p>The Emperor greeted the other two, and Ye Xiao and Azure Dragon followed him and jumped into it.</p><p></p><p>After that, the void gate closed, and the stream began to flow again.</p><p></p><p>When they arrived below, it was brightly lit, spacious and bright, like a fairyland.</p><p></p><p>"Everyone must be careful! Don't think this place is like a fairyland, because there are tests of our ancestor everywhere. If you can't pass the test, you'll either have to retreat or die here. But our previous ancestors have tried, and if you retreat, you won't be able to come in again. So everyone must be very careful."</p><p></p><p>As he spoke, a blue stone suddenly fell from the sky with a loud explosion, creating a huge pit in the ground.</p><p></p><p>"It really came just as I said. This is the first trial, which I've heard others talk about before. It's a sealing stone that has sealed off our path forward, and there's a barrier around it that we can't escape from anywhere."</p><p></p><p>"Then how do we get through?"</p><p></p><p>Azure Dragon couldn't help but ask, and the Emperor replied, "The sealing stone has a sense of awareness. As long as we use our spiritual power to communicate and discover the power within it, we can easily break through it!"</p><p></p><p>"I see!"</p><p></p><p>Azure Dragon nodded and immediately began to release his spiritual power to communicate with the sealing stone.</p><p></p><p>A few minutes later, Azure Dragon's face turned solemn. "No good, there's no response."</p><p></p><p>The Emperor sighed, "You're the weakest of the three of us, why did you try to communicate first?"</p><p></p><p>"I thought I could help Ye Xiao clear more difficulties in the early stage, so he can save some strength."</p><p></p><p>The Emperor shook his head, sighing. When it comes to the key moment, they still have to rely on him.</p><p></p><p>Here is my translation of the Chinese excerpt:</p><p></p><p>Reliable.</p><p></p><p>Soon, he immersed himself in his spiritual power.</p><p></p><p>A few minutes later, Emperor Jing let out a long sigh.</p><p></p><p>"Ye Xiao, why don't you give it a try?"</p><p></p><p>Azure Dragon: "(灬')!"</p><p>Ye Xiao: "(_..)!"</p><p></p><p>He stepped forward and directly raised his sword.</p><p></p><p>Boom! A sword beam burst forth, directly splitting the huge rock.</p><p></p><p>The seal also shattered as a result.</p><p></p><p>Azure Dragon and Emperor Jing were silent for a moment. "Wasn't this thing supposed to be opened with spiritual power?"</p><p></p><p>Ye Xiao nodded.</p><p></p><p>"It is indeed opened with spiritual power, but that method is too slow. Rather than slowly unlocking it with spiritual power, it's better to just split it open with a sword. Let's go, we'll move on to the next challenge."</p><p></p><p>The three of them advanced forward again.</p><p></p><p>Soon, they arrived at a fiery land.</p><p></p><p>This fiery land was filled with raging flames, with powerful fire energy that even began to distort the spiritual qi.</p><p></p><p>Emperor Jing spoke again:</p><p></p><p>"I've heard from the predecessors who retreated that this fire is primarily fueled by burning spiritual qi, producing intense heat. Even Emperor Realm experts may be reduced to ashes before it."</p><p></p><p>Ye Xiao noticed some half-burned white bones nearby, likely a previous senior who had managed to escape, but their speed was a bit slow, and their body was severely scorched, completely losing their vitality. Those who couldn't escape in time were probably reduced to ashes.</p><p></p><p>"This challenge tests the thickness of one's spiritual qi. If the spiritual qi within is not sturdy enough to withstand the searing of this sea of flames, then one cannot pass through it. Even if one enters, if the spiritual qi suddenly becomes insufficient, the person may fall into the flames and be reduced to ashes."</p><p></p><p>"What if we try to forcefully break through with our body techniques?"</p><p></p><p>"There's no way to use body techniques here. If you try to use them, the pressure will increase, and the rate of spiritual qi consumption will also rise significantly. So it's impossible to cheat with body techniques."</p><p></p><p>"How terrifying!"</p><p></p><p>Azure Dragon's pupils contracted slightly, and then he took a deep breath and said, "I'll try first."</p><p></p><p>"Don't be too reckless."</p><p></p><p>"Don't worry, if my spiritual qi is not enough, I'll retreat immediately."</p><p></p><p>Emperor Jing nodded.</p><p></p><p>Azure Dragon then entered the sea of flames.</p><p></p><p>As soon as he entered, the raging fire beneath his feet began to rapidly consume his spiritual qi. If he didn't want his physical body to be scorched, he could only continuously release more spiritual qi to resist.</p><p></p><p>One step, two steps, three steps... The entire sea of flames was probably only about a hundred steps, but Azure Dragon could only take seven steps before feeling he couldn't endure it anymore, and quickly retreated.</p><p></p><p>Emperor Jing shook his head and sighed.</p><p></p><p>"Seeing Azure Dragon's performance, I know I won't be able to make it through. Ye Xiao, although we both really want to see what's in our ancestor's tomb, our strength is simply too lacking. Being with you will only add to your burden. The rest of the way, you should go on your own. We'll wait for you here."</p><p></p><p>Ye Xiao's brow furrowed slightly.</p><p></p><p>"Since you two seniors brought me here, it would be disloyal of me to just leave you behind. How about this, you two follow behind me and see how far we can go. If there comes a point where I can only proceed alone, then we'll have no choice."</p><p></p><p>The two were taken aback.</p><p></p><p>"Ye Xiao, won't this be too much trouble for you?"</p><p></p><p>Ye Xiao smiled slightly.</p><p></p><p>"Didn't I also trouble you to bring me here in the first place? Moreover, we're all from the same ancestor, so we should support each other. Let's go."</p><p></p><p>With that, Ye Xiao grabbed the shoulders of the two like an eagle grabbing chicks, and leapt into the sea of flames.</p><p></p><p>As soon as he entered the sea of flames, the scorching heat rushed towards him, constantly evaporating.</p><p></p><p>In the next moment, an extremely violent spiritual qi began to radiate from Ye Xiao.</p><p></p><p>This thick spiritual qi instantly formed a hundred-meter-long spiritual bridge over the hundred-meter sea of flames.</p><p></p><p>Emperor Jing: "(⊙.⊙)!"</p><p>Azure Dragon: "(⊙.⊙)!"</p><p></p><p>The two were stunned for a moment, and then their expressions became solemn and conflicted.</p><p></p><p>Although they knew that Ye Xiao was much, much stronger than them, was this gap really so huge? They could probably only take a few steps, or even just ten or so steps. </p><p></p><p>But Ye Xiao directly constructed a spiritual bridge, the difference between them was not just a hundredfold.</p><p></p><p>They had all cultivated for only two years. How could Ye Xiao be so monstrous?</p>

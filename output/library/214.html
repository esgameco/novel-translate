        <h1>Chapter 214</h1>
        <div class="content">
            <p>Here is the full English translation of the Chinese excerpt:</p><p></p><p>"Master, what should we do?" </p><p></p><p>"Of course, we will revive them."</p><p></p><p>The other party had mistakenly intruded, and was killed by the formation. We also bear some responsibility.</p><p></p><p>Moreover, they came to set up a formation for Jianghai City.</p><p></p><p>I must revive them.</p><p></p><p>Ye Xiao helplessly took the bodies of the group away, brought them back to Jianghai City, and revived them by the river before leaving.</p><p></p><p>Soon, the Shenzong of the Xiantian Seventh Grade, was the first to regain consciousness.</p><p></p><p>He looked around, somewhat dazed:</p><p></p><p>"Weren't we dead? Is this the underworld?"</p><p></p><p>Chen Qingxuan and the others also woke up and looked around.</p><p></p><p>"This place shouldn't be the underworld, the spiritual energy here is very abundant. If I'm not mistaken, it should be the formation set up by that senior who rescued us."</p><p></p><p>"This is too embarrassing. We absolutely cannot let this out. Otherwise, our lifelong reputations will be completely ruined."</p><p></p><p>"Yes! A Shenzong, several peak Zongjing, and a top-notch formation master. With this combination, we were actually trapped and nearly killed by someone else's formation. If this gets out, we'll lose face for generations."</p><p></p><p>"Let's come up with an excuse."</p><p></p><p>"Just say we encountered a small group of star beasts, and we were clearing them out for the peace and well-being of the common people. Professor Chen, how does this sound?"</p><p></p><p>Chen Qingxuan nodded, feeling his face slightly flushed.</p><p></p><p>But at least, his face was saved.</p><p></p><p>Thinking about this, he took out his phone and dialed his old friend, Dou Changfeng.</p><p></p><p>Ye Xiao returned home and continued his meal. These things are all good for replenishing blood and spiritual energy, and cannot be wasted.</p><p></p><p>He needs to advance to the King Realm, which requires a lot of spiritual energy. What he has provided is fundamentally not enough, but by accumulating little by little, he will eventually have enough.</p><p></p><p>Moreover, his cultivation technique is constantly running.</p><p></p><p>The Gathering Spirit Formation in Jianghai City has been greatly improved by him. The speed of absorbing spiritual energy at all times can surpass that of first-tier cities, and he and all the citizens of Jianghai City can benefit from it.</p><p></p><p>Among them, he benefits the most.</p><p></p><p>Because he is Xiantian Ninth Grade, and his cultivation techniques are all Imperial Arts, which will produce a certain suction effect.</p><p></p><p>Soon, he finished all the dishes and wiped his mouth.</p><p></p><p>"Okay, I'm full, let's go play Sims."</p><p></p><p>On the other side, in Ye Xiao's breeding ground, accompanied by the injuries on his body, Saimuel was gradually regaining consciousness.</p><p></p><p>"Senior Saimuel, thank goodness! You've finally woken up."</p><p></p><p>A familiar voice entered his ears, making him inevitably a little confused.</p><p></p><p>He opened his eyes and looked around at Moyu, and the slightly furrowed brows became even deeper.</p><p></p><p>"Is this... the legendary realm where all the souls go after death? I can't believe there really is such a place. </p><p></p><p>Damn me, Saimuel, following the Tigerking, fighting countless battles in my life, not knowing how many human beings I have slaughtered. Now I've fallen into the gutter in this little Jianghai City. How ironic."</p><p></p><p>The star beasts: "(;_)!"</p><p></p><p>The air was silent for a moment, filled with some awkward atmosphere.</p><p></p><p>Moyu whispered hurriedly, "Senior Saimuel, you haven't died yet. This is not the realm of the dead, this is the eye space of the Gathering Spirit Formation in Jianghai City."</p><p></p><p>Saimuel's face suddenly turned cold.</p><p></p><p>"Bullshit, Moyu, do you think you can fool this general just because you're dead? Don't talk nonsense again! I'll still beat you until your soul scatters."</p><p></p><p>As he spoke, his aura began to erupt.</p><p></p><p>At this time, Noel Fei coughed lightly.</p><p></p><p>"Enough, don't indulge in any false fantasies. You haven't died, and this place is not the realm of the dead."</p><p></p><p>Saimuel was stunned, looking at the other party, and suddenly his expression changed dramatically.</p><p></p><p>"Why do I feel like I've seen you somewhere before?</p><p></p><p>Wait a minute."</p><p></p><p>His body suddenly stopped, and he exclaimed, "Aren't you the senior of the Juchang Clan, Noel Fei? How are you also here? No, your aura shouldn't be this weak. Your strength must be stronger than mine.</p><p></p><p>But your current aura is only at the Xiantian Seventh Grade.</p><p></p><p>Are you a manifestation of Senior Noel Fei?"</p><p></p><p>Saimuel was shocked.</p><p></p><p>When Moyu said this place was not the realm of the dead, he really didn't believe it.</p><p></p><p>But unexpectedly, in the blink of an eye, he saw Noel Fei's manifestation here.</p><p></p><p>There was no more dispute about it.</p><p></p><p>Because Noel Fei was at least a peak Xiantian Ninth Grade expert, he was on the same level as the Tigerking. Although he was not as strong as the Tigerking, he was not an ordinary small fry.</p><p></p><p>At least, he could not be dealt with by himself.</p><p></p><p>But now, even his manifestation was imprisoned here, so this place must not be the underworld.</p><p></p><p>It's just that what exactly is going on here?</p><p></p><p>His brain was a bit unable to keep up.</p><p></p><p>Why are so many star beasts imprisoned here?</p><p></p><p>He had just...</p><p></p><p>Here is the full English translation of the Chinese excerpt:</p><p></p><p>After looking through it all, the weakest of the star beasts here was at least at the innate seventh rank.</p><p></p><p>Although they were nothing in his eyes, they were actually powerful experts in their own right.</p><p></p><p>How could they all be imprisoned in this place? They had just mentioned that this was the eye of the Gathering Spirit Formation of Jianghai City. But why would there be so many star beasts placed within the eye of the Gathering Spirit Formation? It seemed he had noticed the confusion in Saimuel's gaze.</p><p></p><p>Iron Ox couldn't help but explain:</p><p></p><p>"Senior Saimuel, this is indeed the eye of the Gathering Spirit Formation of Jianghai City, but in reality, it is also the breeding ground of that Ye clan human, oh, the one who defeated you."</p><p></p><p>"Breeding ground?"</p><p></p><p>Saimuel's gaze became even more puzzled.</p><p></p><p>The hard-working Susan, who was toiling away to make honey, grumbled:</p><p></p><p>"It's just to make livestock for him. Those with meat will have their meat harvested, those that lay eggs will be made to lay eggs, and those without meat or eggs may have their shells dug out, or be used to make honey, like me.</p><p></p><p>For someone like you, Senior, who is of the Sea Teal Clan, I estimate you may have your feathers plucked. A few feathers every day.</p><p></p><p>Of course, if you can lay eggs, then congratulations! The suffering you endure will be the least, just needing to lay an egg every day.</p><p></p><p>But you're a male, so you probably can't lay eggs, so you'd better pray that your meat isn't too delicious.</p><p></p><p>That way, he'll only pluck your feathers, and not eat your flesh."</p><p></p><p>Saimuel's pupils constricted, and he was soon completely enraged.</p><p></p><p>"What did you say? That bastard! He actually wants to eat my flesh, drink my blood, and pluck my feathers? Who does he think he is?</p><p></p><p>I am one of the three great generals under the Tiger God, how dare that lowly human treat me this way?"</p><p></p><p>Susan glanced at him.</p><p></p><p>"I advise you to watch your mouth. If you keep talking nonsense, you might end up suffering greatly later. Since you've come here, you'd better behave obediently as his poultry."</p><p></p><p>"Shut up!" Saimuel immediately roared furiously, his anger reaching its peak.</p><p></p><p>"I am not like you cowards. I am one of the three great generals under the Tiger God, renowned and powerful. How could I possibly become the poultry of a mere human?</p><p></p><p>Do not lump me together with you.</p><p></p><p>Even if I die here, and he tortures me a thousand or ten thousand times, I will never become his poultry.</p><p></p><p>You all are the disgrace of my star beast clan."</p><p></p><p>The moment he finished speaking, Ye Xiao had already descended into the sealed space, hands in his pockets.</p><p></p><p>Seeing his arrival, all the other star beasts immediately and very tactfully retreated to the walls, making space for Ye Xiao.</p><p></p><p>They had experienced too much, and had now become seasoned veterans.</p><p></p><p>When encountering Ye Xiao, hiding in the corner was the safest option.</p><p></p><p>Saimuel had also noticed Ye Xiao, and he turned around with a cold smile.</p><p></p><p>"Human, you've finally come. I never expected you to have the audacity to want me, to become your poultry!</p><p></p><p>I advise you not to waste your efforts, for I would rather die than submit to you!"</p><p></p><p>Boom! The moment he finished speaking, Ye Xiao punched him squarely in the chest.</p><p></p><p>The Great Annihilation Fist! At such close range, Saimuel had no way to dodge.</p><p></p><p>Ye Xiao's single punch sent Saimuel crashing into the wall, causing a large section of his chest cavity to collapse inward, and he coughed up a mouthful of fresh blood.</p><p></p><p>But he still laughed loudly.</p><p></p><p>"Ah haha haha, how wonderful!"</p><p></p><p>Ye Xiao snorted lightly, the other was still so stubborn.</p><p></p><p>But he wasn't afraid, he had plenty of methods to deal with the other.</p><p></p><p>No matter how powerful, he was still just a bird.</p><p></p><p>Boom! In the blink of an eye, he unleashed another punch.</p><p></p><p>Then the second, third, and fourth punches landed on Saimuel's chest, leaving punch mark after punch mark. Saimuel's true body was even struck out, his feathers stained red with blood, but he still refused to surrender, continuing to laugh uproariously and taunt Ye Xiao.</p><p></p><p>"Haha haha, come at me again! Is your fist really that weak?"</p><p></p><p>After a while, Ye Xiao retracted his fist.</p><p></p><p>He had realized that this technique had little effect on the opponent.</p><p></p><p>If that was the case, then he would try a different approach.</p><p></p><p>The wisdom of humans is boundless, otherwise they would not be called the most intelligent of all beings.</p><p></p><p>Even the most stubborn star beasts have their weaknesses, they are not gods.</p><p></p><p>As long as he found that weakness, everything would be much easier.</p><p></p><p>Ye Xiao walked up to Saimuel, looking him up and down.</p><p></p><p>"Ptui!"</p><p></p><p>Saimuel defiantly spat at Ye Xiao, but it was blocked by Ye Xiao's protective aura and reflected back, landing on Saimuel's feathers.</p><p></p><p>Ye Xiao clearly saw Saimuel's body shudder slightly, a flash of panic and disgust crossing his eyes, before quickly returning to normal.</p><p></p><p>This scene caused the corner of Ye Xiao's mouth to curl upwards.</p><p></p><p>I've found your weakness.</p>

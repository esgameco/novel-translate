        <h1>Chapter 207</h1>
        <div class="content">
            <p>Here is the full English translation of the Chinese excerpt:</p><p></p><p>Three-day holiday.</p><p></p><p>This time the half-beast invasion has brought great trauma to the entire city.</p><p></p><p>Although Dou Changfeng and the others have tried their best to keep the half-beasts outside the city, there are still many high-level half-beasts who have taken advantage of the chaos to rush in, causing considerable damage to Jianghai City.</p><p></p><p>So the holiday is very normal.</p><p></p><p>Ye Xiao doesn't mind it either.</p><p></p><p>Coincidentally, he has just broken through to the Xiantian Ninth Grade realm, and he also needs a few days to adapt to his new strength.</p><p></p><p>Bless the heavens.</p><p></p><p>After breaking through to the Xiantian Ninth Grade, the next step is to assault the King Realm.</p><p></p><p>But the King Realm is not easy to assault, Ye Xiao has already prepared for a protracted battle.</p><p></p><p>However, four years later, the threat of the beast disaster will be even greater.</p><p></p><p>So he needs to arrange a reasonable cultivation plan for himself, striving to break through as soon as possible.</p><p></p><p>Ye Xiao summarized his current resources.</p><p></p><p>He didn't count those forging materials and the like, because there are too many and they are not for improving his cultivation.</p><p></p><p>What Ye Xiao is calculating are his most important things.</p><p></p><p>First is the cultivation techniques.</p><p></p><p>In the Golden Book, there are both synthetic and non-synthetic techniques, which are learned from the star cores of other star beasts.</p><p></p><p>Heart Techniques: Purple Thorn Star Sea, Dharma Sutra.</p><p>Spiritual Techniques: Taixuan Tiangong.</p><p>Attack Techniques: Tyrant Blade, Slash the Heavens in One Sword, Tathagata Divine Palm, Infinite Kalpa Finger, Great Nirvana Fist, Imperial Extreme Sword Technique.</p><p>Defensive Body Techniques: Indestructible Divine Skill.</p><p>Healing Techniques: Replenish the Heavens Technique, Chenxing Incantation, Extreme Healing Technique.</p><p>Body Techniques: Divine Will Incantation, Earth Escape Technique.</p><p>Array Techniques: Disha Tiangong Array, Tianyan Zaohua Array.</p><p>Forging Techniques: Demonic Smithing.</p><p>Alchemy Techniques: Myriad Elements Return to One.</p><p></p><p>Among them, the three Imperial Healing Techniques have reached the stage of synthesis.</p><p></p><p>But it requires sufficient cultivation to synthesize them.</p><p></p><p>Before, when he was at the Xiantian Eighth Grade, he couldn't synthesize them, and now at the Xiantian Ninth Grade, he still can't.</p><p></p><p>However, the brilliance of the Golden Book seems to be a little brighter than before.</p><p></p><p>It seems very likely that when he reaches the King Realm, he will be able to synthesize the Imperial Techniques.</p><p></p><p>I really don't know what kind of powerful techniques he will be able to synthesize at that time?</p><p></p><p>Secondly, supplementary resources.</p><p></p><p>He currently has three Eighth Grade star beasts and seven Xiantian Seventh Grade star beasts, providing him with spiritual energy and blood qi every day in the breeding ground.</p><p></p><p>And now he has also picked so many flowers to give to Susanne the bee, specifically for making honey.</p><p></p><p>In the short term, the supplement of spiritual energy and blood qi should not be too lacking.</p><p></p><p>But he should also consider catching a few more star beasts.</p><p></p><p>After all, he has now advanced to the Xiantian Ninth Grade realm, and his requirements for star beasts are also higher.</p><p></p><p>Otherwise, the spiritual energy supplement in the later stage will not be enough.</p><p></p><p>In addition, he also has the imperial-grade defensive armor Black Scale Armor, as well as the divine weapon that has surpassed the imperial realm - the Great Dragon.</p><p></p><p>As for Illusion Liuli... well, her strength is too weak now, so there's no need to count her in.</p><p></p><p>Star beasts cannot be caught in the short term, because he now wants star beasts above the Xiantian Ninth Grade, and such star beasts are not so easy to obtain.</p><p></p><p>It's not like picking cabbages!</p><p></p><p>Unless he goes to the Star Battlefield.</p><p></p><p>But Ye Xiao doesn't want to go to the Star Battlefield.</p><p></p><p>Liu Chengxun has said that the Star Battlefield is very dangerous, even for Saint Monarch-level experts, they may fall at any time.</p><p></p><p>Moreover, that Tiger God, as well as Xia Bingning, have made Ye Xiao feel a bit wary of the Star Battlefield.</p><p></p><p>There must be many powerful experts there.</p><p></p><p>Speaking of which, Shaolin seems to have Ninth Grade star beasts, and quite a few of them.</p><p></p><p>It is said that Shaolin has Seventy-two Demon Pits, all of which are Ninth Grade Saint Monarch star beasts.</p><p></p><p>Should he go to Shaolin and steal one or two back to raise as pigs? But this does not conform to Ye Xiao's principles, as Illusion Liuli has been unclean before, and he has scolded her several times.</p><p></p><p>It seems that he still needs to find a way to investigate where he can find Xiantian Ninth Grade star beasts more easily.</p><p></p><p>And his current task is to first plant these spiritual flowers.</p><p></p><p>These are the spiritual flowers he has obtained with great difficulty. If he plants them well, he can let Susanne the bee collect honey from them every day.</p><p></p><p>In Jianghai City, which places are suitable for planting spiritual flowers? Ye Xiao thought about it for a while, but it seems there is no suitable place.</p><p></p><p>Spiritual flowers require a lot of sunlight, so it is impossible to hide and plant them, as that would be ineffective.</p><p></p><p>Planting them at his own home is also very dangerous, as they are easily discovered.</p><p></p><p>It's a bit troublesome.</p><p></p><p>Ye Xiao thought for a while, maybe he should find a mountain hideout and set up the Tianyan Zaohua Array and Disha Tiangong Array? The two arrays working together will definitely have an excellent effect.</p><p></p><p>The Tianyan Zaohua Array is responsible for illusion and killing, while the Disha Tiangong Array is responsible for defense.</p><p></p><p>And he has the Divine Will Incantation, which is extremely fast, so he can spend a little time every day to pick the fresh flowers.</p><p></p><p>It can work, it's perfect.</p><p></p><p>So in the following time, Ye Xiao will go find a suitable mountain hideout.</p><p></p><p>Set up the arrays, plant the flowers.</p><p></p><p>When the time comes, it will be deep in the night.</p><p></p><p>Under the starry sky, the experimental base in the Americas is beginning the trial of a new type of fighter aircraft.</p><p></p><p>This time, they didn't mess around with fancy things.</p><p></p><p>They just simply designed it for mass production, to reinforce the Star Battlefield.</p><p></p><p>The previous fighter jets were destroyed every time, so...</p><p></p><p>Here is the full English translation of the Chinese excerpt:</p><p></p><p>There was no longer any hope that they could direct the pilots to create a top-class fighter jet. As long as they could create one that could be directly used and equipped on the star battlefield, that would be enough.</p><p></p><p>"Number 1 test aircraft is ready."</p><p></p><p>"Number 2 test aircraft is ready."</p><p></p><p>"Number 3 is ready."</p><p></p><p>"Play!"</p><p></p><p>"Vomit!"</p><p></p><p>"Shatter!"</p><p></p><p>"Dog!"</p><p></p><p>Under the instructions of the scientists, the pilots immediately piloted the test aircraft and flew towards the stars ahead.</p><p></p><p>The test went very smoothly.</p><p></p><p>The scientists looked at each other and laughed.</p><p></p><p>"Indeed, our ideas were all correct."</p><p></p><p>"The reason why the previous test aircraft always encountered problems was that there might be a strong person in that position, so our tests failed so many times.</p><p></p><p>But now, we have moved the entire base.</p><p></p><p>Naturally, there will be no problem."</p><p></p><p>"It seems that this time, we can finally get it done."</p><p></p><p>"Of course, such a simple test aircraft, if we can't handle it, we might as well go sweep the toilet on the ground."</p><p></p><p>However, just as everyone was excited, the next second.</p><p></p><p>The air suddenly began to twist.</p><p></p><p>The radar flashed rapidly, and everyone's hearts tightened.</p><p></p><p>The next moment, the three test aircraft directly exploded in a blaze of fire and turned into a pile of debris.</p><p></p><p>"Oh! Fuck!"</p><p></p><p>"What's going on? Who is against us? Why is it always like this?"</p><p></p><p>Unlike the craziness in the base, outside, under the starry sky, a figure with a thick aura gradually stepped out from the distorted space.</p><p></p><p>He looked around and couldn't help but raise his eyebrows slightly.</p><p></p><p>"How come there are so many pieces? These foolish human beings always like to mess around with all kinds of fancy things.</p><p></p><p>With this little free time, it would be better to think about how to improve my cultivation.</p><p></p><p>A bunch of idiots."</p><p></p><p>But soon, he spoke again:</p><p></p><p>"Susan, Iron Ox, Moyu, I hope you three are still alive, then I might still be able to rescue you and take you back to see the Tiger God.</p><p></p><p>Of course, you'd better be alive, otherwise the human race will have to bear the wrath of a peak Xianxia-level star beast!"</p><p></p><p>Two days later, Ye Xiao stretched his aching waist in a secluded mountain cave on the north side of Jianghai City.</p><p></p><p>"Finally finished."</p><p></p><p>He had planted all the spiritual flowers of various varieties that he had brought back from the southwestern forest in this mountain cave.</p><p></p><p>The originally dull mountain cave had instantly become colorful, turning into a beautiful flower sea.</p><p></p><p>Such a beautiful thing, not to mention spiritual flowers, even if they were not spiritual flowers, it would probably attract a lot of people's coveting.</p><p></p><p>Fortunately, Ye Xiao's formation was not to be trifled with.</p><p></p><p>Two great emperor formations should be able to protect them without any problems.</p><p></p><p>Ye Xiao thought, in the future, it would be better to let Huan Liuli take charge of this matter.</p><p></p><p>Let her come early every day to pick flowers and then send them to the breeding ground, let Su Shan come to collect honey, so that he won't have to spend time and effort anymore.</p><p></p><p>Ye Xiao's preliminary estimate was that Su Shan could provide him with nearly forty master-level elixir worth of spiritual energy every day.</p><p></p><p>Although this amount is far less good for me as a Xianxia-level nine-grade cultivator than it was for me as a Xianxia-level eight-grade cultivator.</p><p></p><p>But even a small mosquito is still meat.</p><p></p><p>Moreover, it's not like there's no Xianxia-level nine-grade star beast, right?</p><p></p><p>Wait until I have a Xianxia-level nine-grade star beast, then we'll talk.</p><p></p><p>For now, just deal with it.</p><p></p><p>On the other side, the mayor's mansion of Jianghai City also welcomed a group of important guests.</p><p></p><p>"Mayor Du, I am here on the orders of the Central State Division of the Nine State Alliance to announce your dismissal, and your uncle, the Xianxia-level four-grade Grand Elder Long Feng, will take over. Do you have any objections?"</p><p></p><p>Du Tianyu shook his head.</p><p></p><p>"I have no objections, I fully accept the arrangement of the Central State."</p><p></p><p>"You should understand, this personnel change is not just you, but also the director of the library, the dean of the Jianghai Martial Arts Academy, and the commander of the defense team, they will all be replaced.</p><p></p><p>But this is not a bad thing, for Jianghai City, this is a huge benefit.</p><p></p><p>Jianghai City will be completely upgraded to a first-tier city."</p><p></p><p>Du Tianyu clenched his fists, his eyes full of excitement.</p><p></p><p>Jianghai City is finally going to be transformed into a first-tier city by the Nine States.</p><p></p><p>The benefits of becoming a first-tier city are too many to count.</p><p></p><p>First of all, Xianxia-level experts will be stationed in the city.</p><p></p><p>The defense team, the martial arts library, and the martial arts academy will all receive Xianxia-level experts to serve as their managers.</p><p></p><p>This is equivalent to adding three Xianxia-level experts as bodyguards for Jianghai City.</p><p></p><p>It is precisely because of this that he was replaced, and his uncle Long Feng took over the position of mayor.</p>

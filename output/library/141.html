        <h1>Chapter 141</h1>
        <div class="content">
            <p>Here is the full English translation of the Chinese excerpt:</p><p></p><p>"It is the eight-limbed giant chapter - Nolphys, who has the bloodline of a dragon. It is said that its ancestor was an ancient alien species among the star beasts - the Horo fish. Its bloodline power is extremely deep and powerful.</p><p></p><p>More than three hundred years ago, during a beast disaster, it descended upon Chu Zhou with the peak strength of a divine ancestor, attacking the Chu Zhou people. In the end, it was suppressed by a high monk of the Shaolin Temple.</p><p></p><p>For all these years, it has been suppressed under the Seventy-two Demon Caves of Shaolin.</p><p></p><p>It is one of the powerful star beast experts who were suppressed by Shaolin.</p><p></p><p>For all these years, it has been continuously absorbing the spiritual energy of heaven and earth for Chu Zhou."</p><p></p><p>Ye Xiao: "(⊙.⊙)!"</p><p></p><p>An eight-limbed giant chapter? </p><p></p><p>A creature with tentacles?</p><p></p><p>Iron plate squid?</p><p></p><p>Red-braised squid?</p><p></p><p>Dry pot squid?</p><p></p><p>Onion squid?</p><p></p><p>Stir-fried squid? Fried squid skewers?</p><p></p><p>Dry shredded squid tentacles? It seems a bit off, as octopus and squid are two different creatures.</p><p></p><p>Could it be octopus balls? Seeing the silent and pensive Ye Xiao, Fa Zheng thought Ye Xiao was shocked.</p><p></p><p>This is also very normal, after all, even though Ye Xiao's temperament is strong, he is still a young man in his twenties, and his cultivation is not high.</p><p></p><p>Hearing about the powerful Nolphys, he must have been shocked.</p><p></p><p>"This time, a part of Nolphys' avatar has been sealed in Jiang Hai City, which will bring more spiritual energy to Jiang Hai City and help the cultivators there.</p><p></p><p>You can also benefit from it.</p><p></p><p>If you are willing to join our Buddhist sect, I will give you another Condensing Spirit Pill, which should be enough for you to condense your divine soul.</p><p></p><p>At that time, your cultivation should be able to break through to the post-heaven eighth or ninth rank without any problem."</p><p></p><p>"Can I get the Condensing Spirit Pill without joining the Buddhist sect?"</p><p></p><p>"No."</p><p></p><p>After Guangliang the Great Master had discussed with the director, the convoy arrived at the library.</p><p></p><p>However, Ye Xiao and the others could go home.</p><p></p><p>This is easy to explain.</p><p></p><p>Sealing the star beast is a big event, and only the higher-ups are qualified to witness it, not the ordinary people.</p><p></p><p>Ye Xiao didn't feel like hanging around, so it was a good time to go home.</p><p></p><p>As for why they chose the library, he could guess a little, because Aer Wang was waiting for him at the library, and in the end, he also came to the library.</p><p></p><p>So these people probably judged that he was living around the library.</p><p></p><p>What he didn't know was that a huge statue had been erected at the entrance of the library.</p><p></p><p>Wearing a long robe, with a bun and a beard, looking like an old man from ancient times, at least eighty years old.</p><p></p><p>On the back of the statue, there was a sword and a knife.</p><p></p><p>Under the statue's feet, there was a huge rock.</p><p></p><p>Engraved on it were the words - "The Divine Ancestor of Jiang Hai City - The Immortal Swordsman!"</p><p></p><p>When Guangliang and the others arrived, they greeted Dou Tianyu and Dou Changfeng, who were already waiting there, exchanged some pleasantries, and then turned their gaze to the ancient statue.</p><p></p><p>"The Immortal Swordsman! Daring to be called by this name, he must truly be an extraordinary person."</p><p></p><p>Dou Changfeng explained:</p><p></p><p>"Master Guangliang, we actually still don't know who this predecessor is and what his name is.</p><p></p><p>We just call him the Immortal Swordsman Predecessor because he is skilled in both the sword and the knife arts."</p><p></p><p>"I see." </p><p></p><p>Guangliang nodded and couldn't help but sigh.</p><p></p><p>"Since ancient times, most human cultivators have focused on cultivating one martial art. Even the divine ancestors of our Shaolin have specialized in either fist techniques or body cultivation, and only practiced the sword or knife arts as a secondary focus.</p><p></p><p>But to think that Jiang Hai City actually has a divine ancestor who has cultivated both the sword and knife arts to such a high level, it has truly opened my eyes.</p><p></p><p>It's just a pity that I couldn't meet this extraordinary person this time. What a pity! What a pity!"</p><p></p><p>Dou Changfeng nodded.</p><p></p><p>"Who wouldn't say so? Even we local cultivators of Jiang Hai City have been dreaming of catching a glimpse of the Immortal Swordsman Predecessor.</p><p></p><p>Alas, he is like a divine dragon, appearing and disappearing without a trace. We have never seen him.</p><p></p><p>I once had the chance to see him and was fortunate enough to receive the predecessor's grace, using his healing art to heal the injuries on my body.</p><p></p><p>Otherwise, I would have had to go to the capital city to find a famous physician for treatment."</p><p></p><p>"He also knows healing arts?"</p><p></p><p>Guangliang exclaimed in surprise.</p><p></p><p>Dou Changfeng nodded.</p><p></p><p>"Very powerful, likely not weaker than an imperial-level art."</p><p></p><p>"What did you say?" </p><p></p><p>Guangliang couldn't help but shout in shock, even as a sub-divine ancestor, hearing this news made him lose his composure a bit.</p><p></p><p>Too powerful.</p><p></p><p>This predecessor has cultivated two martial arts simultaneously, which is already monstrous enough, and now he also cultivates a healing art not weaker than an imperial-level one.</p><p></p><p>This is simply defying the heavens.</p><p></p><p>He looked at the statue again, his gaze no longer as calm as before, but with a hint of awe and reverence.</p><p></p><p>Humans always admire the strong, and even though he is already at the level of a sub-divine ancestor, when faced with such a powerful divine ancestor, he can't help but feel a sense of longing.</p><p></p><p>This is the might of a divine ancestor!</p><p></p><p>Here is the full English translation of the Chinese excerpt:</p><p></p><p>An extraordinary suppression.</p><p></p><p>Seeing the reverence Guangliang showed towards the Sword Immortal, even the likes of Dou Changfeng and the others couldn't help but feel a sense of pride.</p><p></p><p>Indeed, Guangliang's reverence was not for them, but for the Sword Immortal, who was a renowned figure in Jianghai City. As natives of Jianghai City, they naturally felt a sense of pride.</p><p></p><p>The Sword Immortal, truly the pride of Jianghai City! After a moment, Guangliang finally spoke:</p><p></p><p>"The time has come, let's immediately begin the sealing."</p><p></p><p>"Alright!"</p><p></p><p>Dou Changfeng responded, immediately stepping aside and handing the main stage to Guangliang and the many grand masters from the Shaolin Martial Arts Academy.</p><p></p><p>The construction of the Spirit Gathering Formation needed to be done at midnight.</p><p></p><p>Unlike the formations used to suppress evil spirits, which could utilize the power of the sun at noon to suppress the evil energy within the evil spirits, this one used a star beast as the formation's eye. Not only did it need to suppress the star beast, but it also had to ensure that the star beast's power would not weaken, in order to ensure the Spirit Gathering Formation achieved the most perfect effect.</p><p></p><p>Moreover, from another perspective, both the star beast and humans required the power of the sun, the yang energy.</p><p></p><p>The most intense at noon, the power of the Dharma Door martial arts would be the strongest, and the star beast's power would also correspondingly increase, thereby increasing the difficulty of the sealing.</p><p></p><p>At midnight, the power of the Dharma Door martial arts would weaken, but the star beast's power would also weaken. At this time, if the Dharma Door could strengthen their martial artists, they could easily offset the negative impact of the weakened martial arts power.</p><p></p><p>Therefore, in addition to a quasi-divine patriarch, Shaolin also dispatched eighteen grand masters! Soon, everyone began to set up the formation.</p><p></p><p>Guided by Guangliang, they carved the formation patterns, while the others provided assistance, infusing the intense yang energy of the Dharma Door martial arts into the formation to help activate it and suppress Noel Faust.</p><p></p><p>Initially, everything went smoothly. As long as they completed carving the formation, successfully activated it, and placed the statue of the Sword Immortal on the sealing, it would all be done.</p><p></p><p>But just as the formation was reaching its critical stage, an anomaly suddenly occurred.</p><p></p><p>One of the grand masters abruptly stopped infusing his Dharma Door martial arts power.</p><p></p><p>Not only did he stop infusing the Dharma Door martial arts power, but he also suddenly struck out, slapping Guangliang hard in the ribs.</p><p></p><p>"Puchi—!"</p><p></p><p>Guangliang immediately coughed up a mouthful of fresh blood, and his entire aura instantly withered.</p><p></p><p>The others were all shocked.</p><p></p><p>"Faner, what are you doing?"</p><p></p><p>Faner was no fool, he struck and then immediately fled, not even bothering to respond to them.</p><p></p><p>"Damn it! Don't let him escape."</p><p></p><p>The others were filled with righteous indignation and were about to strike out, but Guangliang suddenly spoke:</p><p></p><p>"Everyone, stop!"</p><p></p><p>"But senior, we can't let Faner escape. He must have already betrayed our kind."</p><p></p><p>Guangliang's complexion was pale, but his gaze remained firm.</p><p></p><p>"He is trying to disrupt our construction of the Spirit Gathering Formation. If you go after him now, you'll be falling into his trap.</p><p></p><p>Noel Faust may take the opportunity to escape. We must complete the sealing and the Spirit Gathering Formation first, and deal with Noel Faust as the priority.</p><p></p><p>Dean Dou, please take people to capture Faner."</p><p></p><p>Dou Changfeng nodded in agreement.</p><p></p><p>"Don't worry, Master, we'll take care of it."</p><p></p><p>With that, he stepped down and instantly disappeared from the spot. The other few martial artists also quickly followed him.</p><p></p><p>Faner fled rapidly, heading towards the outskirts of Jianghai City.</p><p></p><p>"That bald-headed Guangliang is quite smart, knowing not to fall for my trap. But I've already injured him, so it doesn't matter.</p><p></p><p>As long as this fragment of my divine body is still alive, after Guangliang leaves, I can find an opportunity to break through that Spirit Gathering Formation.</p><p></p><p>Then, using my divine body fragments, I'll go to Shaolin and rescue my main body, as well as the other divine patriarch star beasts' main bodies.</p><p></p><p>At that time, the entire Central Plain will be plunged into deep fear."</p><p></p><p>The moment he finished speaking, he suddenly sensed several powerful auras rapidly chasing after him from behind.</p><p></p><p>"This aura? It's the grand masters of Jianghai City.</p><p></p><p>Normally, I would have just gone and killed them directly.</p><p></p><p>But now, I should protect myself first, temporarily evade them, to ensure that my plan to disrupt the formation and release the divine body fragments won't go wrong."</p><p></p><p>Thinking of this, he immediately descended rapidly towards the ground.</p><p></p><p>In an instant, he landed on the ground and suppressed his aura, completely concealing it.</p><p></p><p>Soon, he saw several figures fly over his head, and a slight smile appeared on his lips.</p><p></p><p>Success.</p><p></p><p>Now, I just need to wait for Guangliang to lead the team out of Jianghai City.</p><p></p><p>Before that, I should find a place to quietly wait for a few days.</p><p></p><p>Sweeping his gaze, his eyes fell on a solitary small house not far away.</p><p></p><p>That small house, with no village in front and no shop behind, was the perfect hiding place.</p>

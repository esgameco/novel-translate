        <h1>Chapter 18</h1>
        <div class="content">
            <p>Here is the full English translation of the Chinese excerpt:</p><p></p><p>"Okay!" </p><p></p><p>The other party quickly dispelled the illusion, revealing its true form - a little girl of about five or six years old, delicate and beautiful.</p><p></p><p>She was wearing a big red Lolita dress, with red leather shoes and pure white stockings on her little legs.</p><p></p><p>But these details were not important. The important thing was that she had a pair of cat ears, and a cute little tail would occasionally peek out from under her dress.</p><p></p><p>Ye Xiao narrowed his eyes.</p><p></p><p>A star beast! </p><p></p><p>And not just any star beast, but one that could transform into a human form!</p><p></p><p>A master-level one! "My name is Huan Liuli, and I'm known as the 'Flower of the Eastern Factory' in the jianghu. I followed the star beast army during the star beast uprising fifty years ago and came to Jianghai City. But all my companions were destroyed, and I'm the only star beast left. To avoid being hunted by humans, I've been hiding here, using illusions to scare people."</p><p></p><p>Hearing this, Ye Xiao understood a bit more.</p><p></p><p>It was said that the pressure on the frontlines was too great, so every sixty years, some star beasts would be released into human cities, known as the "beast calamity." On one hand, this was to relieve the pressure on the frontlines. On the other hand, it was to provide training for humans who had never been to the battlefield.</p><p></p><p>The released star beasts were certainly not as powerful as those on the battlefield, but there were still master-level ones among them.</p><p></p><p>The master-level star beast in front of him was one of those that had come over at that time.</p><p></p><p>After the beast calamity was quelled, she had hidden in this house, using illusions to scare people.</p><p></p><p>However, Ye Xiao had often read the star beast encyclopedia and had a lot of knowledge in this area. A master-level feline star beast that was also proficient in illusions - could it be... the Illusion Cat? Ye Xiao's mind stirred, but his expression remained calm as he asked, "What is your true form?"</p><p></p><p>Huan Liuli proudly patted her flat chest.</p><p></p><p>"My true form is the ruler of illusion-type star beasts - the Illusion Cat!"</p><p></p><p>Just as human spiritual roots could be strong or weak, the bloodlines of star beasts also varied in strength.</p><p></p><p>The stronger the bloodline, the higher the potential for future evolution.</p><p></p><p>And the Illusion Cat bloodline was very strong, the highest among illusion-type star beasts! Her future growth was limitless.</p><p></p><p>And she had only been scaring people, not killing, just mischief at most - there was no need to completely eliminate her! "Now you have two choices. One is to accept me as your master and become my star pet."</p><p></p><p>"Impossible!" </p><p></p><p>The little Lolita Huan Liuli immediately refused with a serious and angry expression.</p><p></p><p>"Although your cultivation is strong, star beasts have our own innate pride! We beast people will never be slaves!"</p><p></p><p>Ye Xiao sighed slightly.</p><p></p><p>"Then you'll have to choose the second option."</p><p></p><p>As he spoke, he raised his right hand again, the aura of the Tyrannical Sword forming.</p><p></p><p>Huan Liuli's expression immediately changed.</p><p></p><p>"Senior, isn't being a star pet just that? Why wield a sword and be so uncivilized!"</p><p></p><p>Ye Xiao retracted the sword intent.</p><p></p><p>"Then just choose the first option, why bother resisting?"</p><p></p><p>Without giving Huan Liuli a chance to resist, he flicked his finger, drawing a drop of her blood that sank into her brow.</p><p></p><p>In the next moment, he had formed a special contract with Huan Liuli.</p><p></p><p>He could now sense her location and general information, such as her cultivation or whether she was injured and fighting someone.</p><p></p><p>Huan Liuli could also sense his danger, but could not access his other private information.</p><p></p><p>Who would have thought that a haunted house rented for 100 yuan a month would yield a master-level star pet, and an Illusion Cat with top-tier bloodline at that.</p><p></p><p>Here is the full English translation of the Chinese excerpt:</p><p></p><p>"Blood money!" Why do you keep calling yourself 'Zaka'?"</p><p></p><p>Huan Liuli was originally quite unhappy, but when she heard Ye Xiao ask this question, a look of pride actually appeared on her face. She slightly raised her chin and said proudly:</p><p></p><p>"When Zaka first came to this house, the power hadn't been cut off yet, and there was this thing called a television that was playing a TV drama. In it, there was an incredibly powerful and awe-inspiring character named Cao Zhengchun! Everyone called him 'Boss Cao'! His power and influence were boundless!</p><p></p><p>He would call himself 'Zaka', so Zaka must be an extremely domineering person to give himself such a title!"</p><p></p><p>Ye Xiao's face couldn't help but twitch slightly.</p><p></p><p>Who would have thought that this cat was also a deep-rooted chuunibyou.</p><p></p><p>"Did you see how that TV drama ended?"</p><p></p><p>Huan Liuli shook her head.</p><p></p><p>"No, Zaka scared off the original tenants, and would turn on the TV by himself every night. Later, I don't know why, but they took the TV away. Zaka didn't get to see the ending."</p><p></p><p>Ye Xiao's face twitched again.</p><p></p><p>The tenants were scared off, and someone was turning on the TV every night in the house - any normal person would be so frightened that they'd just throw the TV out.</p><p></p><p>But at least they did throw the TV out, or else this deeply chuunibyou cat would have been utterly embarrassed.</p><p></p><p>Clearing his throat, he spoke again:</p><p></p><p>"From today on, I've taken over this house."</p><p></p><p>Huan Liuli was slightly shocked in her heart, not expecting this guy to actually have money! Renting a house for humans doesn't seem cheap!</p><p></p><p>But she soon stopped being surprised.</p><p></p><p>What does Zaka have to do with money? One day when you get killed, I, Miss Granny, will be free.</p><p></p><p>Then, all your money will be Zaka's!</p><p></p><p>"Since you've become my star pet, from now on you'll be responsible for cleaning upstairs and downstairs, serving me tea and water, massaging my back and legs, and in the winter you'll have to get into the bed early to warm it up for me."</p><p></p><p>Huan Liuli angrily refused!</p><p></p><p>"No way! Although Zaka has been taken in as a star pet, Zaka also has dignity! Zaka can at most assist you in battle, but serving tea and water is absolutely impossible, and massaging and warming the bed is just a pipe dream!"</p><p></p><p>Ye Xiao wasn't flustered, he just raised his right hand again.</p><p></p><p>"I have a famous dish called the 'Dragon and Tiger Duel', and one of the main ingredients is a feline star beast."</p><p></p><p>Huan Liuli's expression changed.</p><p></p><p>"Master, please have a seat. Zaka will go wash some fruit for you. It's all from the nearby supermarket that Zaka stole last night, very fresh."</p><p></p><p>Ye Xiao nodded, sat down on the sofa to rest, and Huan Liuli quickly went to the kitchen to wash the fruit.</p><p></p><p>Watching Huan Liuli leave, Ye Xiao began to plan the next steps.</p><p></p><p>The environment here is still good, and he's tired of living in the dorm, so he can come here to relax.</p><p></p><p>With Huan Liuli guarding, outsiders won't be able to casually come in, which will better ensure his privacy.</p><p></p><p>Furthermore, in the future when he cultivates, he can also consider training Huan Liuli.</p><p></p><p>Her bloodline talent is very strong, and if she's cultivated, she won't be weaker than a divine cultivator, and can become a powerful assistant for him.</p><p></p><p>Star beasts are enslaved by humans, and are called 'tiger guards'; humans are enslaved by star beasts, and are called 'star pets'.</p><p></p><p>Among humans, there are also many who cultivate the spiritual system, controlling star beasts in battle, and are renowned throughout the world.</p><p></p><p>The only thing is, he must strictly supervise her, and not let her randomly harm humans.</p><p></p><p>[This chapter ends here.]</p>

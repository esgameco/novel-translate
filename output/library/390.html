        <h1>Chapter 390</h1>
        <div class="content">
            <p>Here is the full English translation of the Chinese excerpt:</p><p></p><p>The lobsters, crabs, wolves, daffodils, tigers, and dragons - all kinds of delicious ingredients were available.</p><p></p><p>This made Ye Xiao feel like he was back when he had just started building the Star Beast Breeding Farm.</p><p></p><p>Eating star beast meat, drinking a little wine, and holding a bottle of honey milk in his arms.</p><p></p><p>Even in the ancient times, this would have been the life of a small landlord! And because of this, he didn't need to be in a hurry to cultivate now.</p><p></p><p>Eating a piece of star beast meat was stronger than cultivating on his own for a whole night, so why bother cultivating?</p><p></p><p>It would be a waste of time.</p><p></p><p>So now, after getting off work, he just strolled on the streets, because you never know when you might come across an extremely powerful star beast to enrich his Star Beast Breeding Farm.</p><p></p><p>But tonight, it seems there's no hope.</p><p></p><p>In the past, as soon as he got off work, he could immediately find one on the street.</p><p></p><p>But today, he's been searching for an hour and still hasn't found any.</p><p></p><p>Looks like there are none left.</p><p></p><p>Thinking about it carefully, these are not ordinary star beasts, but a group of extremely powerful Xiu Zun realm star beasts.</p><p></p><p>Star beasts at this level are extremely rare.</p><p></p><p>Being able to find one can be considered a rare stroke of luck.</p><p></p><p>However, he has recently found so many, it's simply an explosion of good luck!</p><p></p><p>So he shouldn't expect too much.</p><p></p><p>But speaking of which, these super-powerful star beasts have appeared in large numbers recently!</p><p></p><p>It feels a bit strange.</p><p></p><p>Although Ye Xiao was puzzled before, he had searched the memories of the Yaoguai Wolf and found nothing, so the wolf was just passing through.</p><p></p><p>As for the daffodils and the others, he didn't continue searching.</p><p></p><p>Now that he thinks about it, he should take a look.</p><p></p><p>After all, this matter is really too mysterious.</p><p></p><p>Ye Xiao didn't dare to believe that the heavens were sending him a batch of nutritious food because his cultivation was slowing down.</p><p></p><p>Alright, let's go back and take a look.</p><p></p><p>But at this moment, his spiritual sense suddenly perceived something. There are many experts in Jianghai City, even some at the Shi Shen realm.</p><p></p><p>However, not everyone has a ninth-grade spiritual technique like him - the Great Luo Divine Thought.</p><p></p><p>And not everyone has a Primal Eye like him, an extremely extraordinary existence.</p><p></p><p>So Ye Xiao can perceive things that others may not be able to.</p><p></p><p>"Wait, this is a Xiu Zun realm beast lord."</p><p></p><p>Ye Xiao suddenly felt his breathing become a bit heavy.</p><p></p><p>A Xiu Zun realm beast lord!</p><p></p><p>His aura is definitely much stronger than all the star beasts he has recently obtained.</p><p></p><p>If he could capture it, it would definitely greatly benefit his strength.</p><p></p><p>Of course, its strength is also much stronger.</p><p></p><p>Although Ye Xiao's level allows him to defeat opponents above his rank, this Xiu Zun beast lord is definitely not as easy to deal with as the previous ones.</p><p></p><p>The ones he encountered before were either at the same level or below, and he could easily one-shot them and bring them back to his underground lair without being discovered.</p><p></p><p>He doesn't know if this star beast has any superior techniques, which might make it a bit more troublesome.</p><p></p><p>Of course, when Ye Xiao says "troublesome", it might just mean it takes an extra second.</p><p></p><p>But there are too many powerful experts in Jianghai City right now.</p><p></p><p>That one second might attract countless people to his location and expose his identity.</p><p></p><p>However, this is such a good piece of meat, it would be too much of a pity to let it go.</p><p></p><p>Should he make a move or not?</p><p></p><p>Ye Xiao pondered for a moment, his gaze becoming deep and serious.</p><p></p><p>He can't let this one go.</p><p></p><p>After all, a true gourmet can't give up any top-quality ingredients.</p><p></p><p>Especially when this ingredient is flying right over his head! He definitely can't let it get away.</p><p></p><p>But Ye Xiao needs to kill it in one strike.</p><p></p><p>First, he'll use his spiritual sense to predict its flight path, then use his Primal Eye to lock onto its movements, and finally unleash the Annihilation Treasure Art, overlaying it with a divine technique, to forcefully destroy it!</p><p></p><p>For this strike, Ye Xiao will use 200% of his power.</p><p></p><p>At the same time, he must perfectly hit the vital point.</p><p></p><p>In an instant, he'll make the opponent lose the ability to resist, and then take it away.</p><p></p><p>This way, he can avoid being seen by others, and also capture it.</p><p></p><p>Okay, the decision is made! He'll use that move - the Exterminate the Stars!</p><p></p><p>The peak divine technique in his leg techniques.</p><p></p><p>Leg techniques are the most powerful attack method of the human body, and with the addition of the Annihilation Treasure Art, it should be enough to instantly kill the opponent.</p><p></p><p>Even if the battle is too fierce and causes him injury, he can use the Immortality Treasure Art to repair his wounds.</p><p></p><p>Thinking about this, he immediately starts using the Great Luo Divine Thought to calculate the opponent's flight path, then takes a deep breath and begins to act.</p><p></p><p>In the starry sky, a dragon-bird with double wings is spreading its wings and soaring high.</p><p></p><p>Here is my translation of the Chinese excerpt:</p><p></p><p>He was the strongest existence in the hands of the Cloud Water Sect. </p><p></p><p>He had completely reached the Demigod Realm as a Demigod Beast Lord!</p><p></p><p>Within his body, he had condensed the most powerful bloodline powers of both the Dragon Clan and the Phoenix Clan from the universe.</p><p></p><p>This made his attacks, speed, and combat endurance among the best of his level.</p><p></p><p>Even if the opponent was also at the Demigod Realm, they might not be qualified to directly confront him.</p><p></p><p>At this moment, he raised his proud head and soared into the sky above the Jianghai City.</p><p></p><p>"That group of waste Dragon Blood Tigers, they are truly a bunch of trash. They can't even handle a small task, and now I, the Lord, have to personally step in.</p><p></p><p>Once I find them, I will severely punish them, making them pay the price for their stupidity and worthlessness."</p><p></p><p>After a pause, he swept his gaze downwards.</p><p></p><p>"Their aura seems to have disappeared from here, so there must be something down there. Looks like I'll start searching for clues from this place."</p><p></p><p>As he spoke, he was preparing to descend and transform back into human form to enter Jianghai City.</p><p></p><p>However, at this critical moment, he suddenly felt an extremely terrifying killing intent envelop him.</p><p></p><p>At the same time, he also saw a beam of light rushing towards him from below at an unstoppable speed!</p><p></p><p>"Hm? I've actually been discovered. This person is so powerful, their speed is able to reach this level, covering a thousand-mile distance in the blink of an eye."</p><p></p><p>After a cry of surprise, Ye Xiao had already appeared before him.</p><p></p><p>Seeing Ye Xiao's kick, his pupils suddenly trembled.</p><p></p><p>"So strong!"</p><p></p><p>He vaguely felt that if this move struck his head, he would be utterly destroyed without a trace.</p><p></p><p>Even though his cultivation had reached the Demigod Realm, he would absolutely not be a match for this person.</p><p></p><p>He dared not be careless in the slightest, immediately raising both arms to block in front of his forehead.</p><p></p><p>As long as he protected his vital point, he would be fine.</p><p></p><p>This move was simply too fast, he had no way to dodge it, and he didn't even want to try.</p><p></p><p>All he wanted was to withstand this attack.</p><p></p><p>He knew his arms would definitely be broken, but it didn't matter, because with his arms broken, his head would not die.</p><p></p><p>Moreover, the attacking force was so powerful that it would surely push him back a distance.</p><p></p><p>At that time, he would just turn and run, quickly returning to his master.</p><p></p><p>With his speed, it would only take a few breaths to get from here to his master.</p><p></p><p>It was as simple as it could be.</p><p></p><p>He had prepared all his countermeasures, just waiting for Ye Xiao's leg to crash into his head.</p><p></p><p>However, he never imagined that Ye Xiao never intended to attack his head.</p><p></p><p>When his arms were blocking in front of his forehead, Ye Xiao's divine-level Annihilation Star Kick, combined with the Apocalypse Martial Art, ruthlessly bombarded the area between his legs.</p><p></p><p>"Fuck!"</p><p></p><p>The overwhelming sense of tearing pain came from between his legs.</p><p></p><p>That unimaginable agony caused all his organs to momentarily fall into a state of paralysis and fainting.</p><p></p><p>It hurt! It hurt too much! The pain was excruciating!</p><p></p><p>This damn human, actually so shameless, not only ambushing but also striking that place. </p><p></p><p>Was that place even allowed to be hit? Was he even human? </p><p></p><p>He was not worthy of being called human! He was just a beast! No, calling him a beast would be an insult to beasts.</p><p></p><p>Beasts were far stronger than him.</p><p></p><p>The crippled Dragon Bird lost all combat power and was then pierced through the chest by Ye Xiao's next punch.</p><p></p><p>Instant kill!</p><p></p><p>Afterwards, Ye Xiao used the Yin-Yang Escape Technique to directly take him away from this place.</p><p></p><p>At the same time, several figures emerged from the ground and quickly rose into the air.</p><p></p><p>When Ye Xiao dealt with the other spirit beasts, he did not need to use his full strength, so his aura did not spread out.</p><p></p><p>But this time, in order to contend with the Dragon Bird and kill beyond his level, he had to unleash his full power in an instant, so he could not hold back.</p><p></p><p>His aura was thus detected by the experts of Jianghai City.</p><p></p><p>"What just happened?"</p><p></p><p>"I don't know, I just felt an extremely powerful aura. It seems to have reached the peak of the Ninth Realm of the Divine Realm, almost reaching the Demigod Realm.</p><p></p><p>But I don't know why? There also seems to be a true Demigod Realm-level aura remaining in the air."</p><p></p><p>"Could it be that a great battle just took place here?"</p><p></p><p>"But if two such powerful experts fought here, how could they have disappeared from the scene so quickly after just one exchange?"</p><p></p><p>"I don't know, but one thing is certain, the other party did not want us to know, and they are truly powerful. Moreover, their aura is something we have never felt before."</p><p></p><p>At this time, a weak voice spoke up:</p><p></p><p>"Could it be that he is the Sword Immortal of Jianghai City?"</p>

        <h1>Chapter 360</h1>
        <div class="content">
            <p>Here is the full English translation of the Chinese excerpt:</p><p></p><p>And so, in the days that followed, Ye Xiao continued to read books.</p><p></p><p>His main focus was on the study of blade techniques.</p><p></p><p>Because blade techniques are the most common and easiest to find, they are especially suitable for refining into a divine art.</p><p></p><p>Eventually, he would be able to forge an ancient divine technique.</p><p></p><p>Most of his friends around him had already gone to the Starry Sky to loot tombs.</p><p></p><p>Tomb raiding has practically become a popular profession now, with everyone wanting to join in.</p><p></p><p>Just the other day, Fa Zheng had just broken through to the Divine Sect, and he immediately applied to enter the Starry Sky.</p><p></p><p>Even this bald guy has started digging up his ancestors' graves, which shows just how great the allure of divine tombs is. Rumor has it that they are now able to unearth several new tombs per day, and some even contain tombs of Slay-the-Divine Realm experts.</p><p></p><p>In a single divine tomb, there would be at least tens of thousands of divine crystals, not to mention all the various elixirs and cultivation techniques. It's a pure profit! The only issue is that some people like the junior Pu Jiansheng still haven't reached the Divine Sect realm, so they are working hard to break through, striving to gain the qualifications to go tomb raiding.</p><p></p><p>In the past, everyone cultivated and grew stronger purely for the sake of becoming stronger.</p><p></p><p>But now, everyone cultivates and grows stronger solely for the purpose of looting others' graves.</p><p></p><p>The times have truly changed, to the point where even grave robbing has become a respectable profession.</p><p></p><p>Grave robbing is an addiction, easy to get hooked on, and with no cure.</p><p></p><p>At this moment, Ye Xiao's spiritual awareness stone lit up, displaying a message from Illusion Liuli.</p><p></p><p>"Dear master, yesterday's divine crystal mining target was exceeded by X6 units, and the mining continues today."</p><p></p><p>Ye Xiao replied with a message:</p><p></p><p>"Keep it up, don't stop. Dig hard, dig through it!"</p><p></p><p>There was no other choice. His own cultivation was arduous, and resources were lacking. Where else could he find benefits greater than tomb raiding? The resources within those tombs were truly bountiful.</p><p></p><p>Six billion divine crystals a day.</p><p></p><p>So far, in just a few days, Ye Xiao had already amassed a personal fortune of thirty to forty billion divine crystals.</p><p></p><p>At this rate, it wouldn't be long before he could replace the "commoner" label with "divine."</p><p></p><p>"Right now, we're only mining around six billion divine crystals per day. If we really hit the Divine Kingdom's treasure trove, who knows what treasures might be found there. I'm really looking forward to it."</p><p></p><p>As the words left his mouth, Gu Hai walked up from the stairwell.</p><p></p><p>"Old Ye, what are you looking forward to?"</p><p></p><p>Ye Xiao was not at all surprised. With his current perception abilities, he could sense who had farted a mile away, let alone Gu Hai's approach.</p><p></p><p>Gu Hai hadn't even reached the library yet, but Ye Xiao had already sensed his presence.</p><p></p><p>"Nothing much. What brings you here?"</p><p></p><p>"Well, I've been wanting to recharge my batteries lately. Now that Mimi's a bit older, I can spare some time to cultivate. The future belongs to pure martial artists, and if I don't give it my all now, I might not even be able to afford food in a few decades.</p><p></p><p>Can you recommend some books for me?"</p><p></p><p>Ye Xiao nodded.</p><p></p><p>"Since you cultivate blade techniques, start with a couple of grandmaster-level blade arts to lay the foundation. They're on the left bookshelf.</p><p></p><p>After you've mastered those, then learn the Imperial Techniques. Although the Imperial Techniques are now open to the public and are incredibly powerful, they are also quite profound, and you wouldn't be able to understand them yet."</p><p></p><p>"Okay, got it!"</p><p></p><p>Gu Hai went to grab the blade arts books and sat down across from Ye Xiao, unable to resist asking curiously, "By the way, why don't you go to the Starry Sky? Don't you know how amazing tomb raiding is there now? There's no life-threatening danger, and the rewards are huge.</p><p></p><p>I heard that if you participate in tomb raiding, 20% of the earnings go to you, and 80% go to the sect.</p><p></p><p>Even with that split, people like Yu Yan are still earning boatloads. Yu Yan can dig up nearly a thousand divine crystals a day, and she gets to keep two or three hundred of them. Not to mention the elixirs and cultivation techniques she finds. And she's just at the Divine Sect realm - imagine how much you could earn if you went up there to tomb raid.</p><p></p><p>With your strength, you could easily rake in tens of thousands of divine crystals a day. Wouldn't that be much better than just sitting here reading books?"</p><p></p><p>Ye Xiao gave a faint smile.</p><p></p><p>"My personality is rather laid-back. I'm not that interested in competing for those things. Reading books suits me just fine."</p><p></p><p>Gu Hai shook his head slightly.</p><p></p><p>"You're really a strange one. Alright, keep reading then."</p><p></p><p>Ye Xiao didn't say much more.</p><p></p><p>He couldn't very well tell Gu Hai that the tombs they were raiding were just ordinary Divine Realm ones, while he was digging into the Divine Kingdom's treasure trove, could he? Nor could he tell him that he didn't need to personally do the work, as he had a whole team of miners digging 24/7 to bring him six billion divine crystals a day. And he certainly couldn't tell him that just by reading books, he could refine an ancient divine technique.</p><p></p><p>But at that moment, Ye Xiao's gaze shifted slightly.</p><p></p><p>A powerful expert had arrived.</p><p></p><p>And he was accompanied by a very young Emperor Realm cultivator, over seventy dragons strong.</p><p></p><p>It seemed to be a member of the XuanYuan Clan, a major family. To be able to reach this level of strength at such a young age, and to have a Divine Realm expert guarding him, was quite remarkable.</p><p></p><p>The two figures appeared, with one being Ning Zhiyuan.</p><p></p><p>The other figure did not manifest, as he was a steward and personal bodyguard assigned to Ning by the Ning Clan.</p><p></p><p>In reality, the Ning Clan's strength went far beyond just this. </p><p></p><p>But the Ning Clan had a hierarchical system when it came to their guards and protectors.</p><p></p><p>Ning Zhiyuan was part of the youngest generation, with only Emperor Realm strength. This generation was assigned Divine Realm and above experts as their guards.</p><p></p><p>The previous generation, who were over a hundred years old, had cultivated to realms beyond that.</p><p></p><p>Here is my translation of the Chinese excerpt:</p><p></p><p>The divine realm no longer needed divine realm guards. Additionally, for young masters like them, they normally needed to go out and gain experience, so having too many powerful experts guarding them was not good for their own development.</p><p></p><p>Moreover, they also had a portion of divine souls and divine blood stored in the Ning family ancestral hall. Even if they failed in their trials outside and perished, the family could revive them.</p><p></p><p>Ning Zhiyuan stood in front of the library, his hands clasped behind his back, staring intently at the statue of the Sword and Saber Immortal. </p><p></p><p>The statue of the Sword and Saber Immortal had long since become a landmark building in the Jianghai City, and the Emperors felt that using an elderly image for the Sword and Saber Immortal would better confuse the XuanYuan clan, preventing them from thinking it was a young person.</p><p></p><p>So the statue of the Sword and Saber Immortal had not been damaged.</p><p></p><p>"This is not the person I saw the other day," Ning Zhiyuan muttered. Although he had not clearly seen Ye Xiao's face, he knew Ye Xiao was very young, definitely not as old as the statue.</p><p></p><p>"Could it be that person is not the Sword and Saber Immortal of the Nine Realms?"</p><p></p><p>Shaking his head, Ning Zhiyuan entered the library. Since there were many people downstairs on the lower two or three floors, he did not linger.</p><p></p><p>He disliked noisy, crowded places, so he merely used his divine sense to sweep through the books on each floor and the people there.</p><p></p><p>It was not until the fourth floor that he discovered a few books containing information about the Sword and Saber Immortal.</p><p></p><p>"It's quite well hidden," Ning Zhiyuan murmured, walking straight over.</p><p></p><p>Naturally, Ye Xiao had also noticed him, and likewise had sensed Ning Zhiyuan scanning the books with his spiritual power.</p><p></p><p>Could this person be the one who had witnessed Ye Xiao's tribulation ascension to divinity in the starry sky that day?</p><p></p><p>How coincidental.</p><p></p><p>However, Ye Xiao did not pay too much attention to him, continuing to read his book.</p><p></p><p>He just sighed inwardly, wondering why the golden book required him to read the cultivation techniques word by word. If he could just scan them with his spiritual power, it would be so much more convenient. He probably could have gathered many divine arts instantly.</p><p></p><p>Ning Zhiyuan spent some time on the fourth floor, looking through those few books, but did not find the answer he was seeking. </p><p></p><p>Finally, he sighed softly and continued down to the next floor.</p><p></p><p>In front of Ye Xiao, he was utterly unable to sense how powerful Ye Xiao's cultivation was. His own level was still far inferior to Ye Xiao's.</p><p></p><p>But just then, Gu Hai suddenly spoke up:</p><p></p><p>"Ye Xiao, this sword technique is too difficult to practice, isn't it? I can't understand a lot of it. You're the one who uses swords, so could you take a look for me?"</p><p></p><p>Ning Zhiyuan, who had already decided to go upstairs, paused for a moment and glanced over at Ye Xiao.</p><p></p><p>His gaze lingered on Ye Xiao for a moment.</p><p></p><p>Ye Xiao was somewhat surprised. He hadn't expected Ning Zhiyuan to have divine eyes as well.</p><p></p><p>After finding nothing when scanning Ye Xiao with his spiritual power, Ning Zhiyuan had actually activated his divine eyes to scan Ye Xiao again.</p><p></p><p>But unfortunately, his visual power was no match for Ye Xiao's primal eyes. So after a brief glimpse with the Emerald Fire Golden Eyes, Ning Zhiyuan still gained nothing, and could only shake his head before continuing upstairs.</p><p></p><p>Ye Xiao remained calm and composed throughout, unhurriedly explaining the sword technique to Gu Hai.</p><p></p><p>Gu Hai, focused on the book, did not notice that a flash of the Emerald Fire Golden Eyes had appeared in Ye Xiao's eyes just now.</p><p></p><p>In that instant when Ning Zhiyuan had looked at him, Ye Xiao's primal eyes had activated the Emerald Fire Golden Eyes attribute within them, making his primal eyes even stronger.</p><p></p><p>Ning Zhiyuan's casual action had unexpectedly given Ye Xiao a great gift.</p><p></p><p>After explaining it to Gu Hai, Ye Xiao finally managed to extract a divine-level sword technique from the imperial art - Shattering the Starry River.</p><p></p><p>Once he cultivated this sword technique to the Great Perfection realm, Ye Xiao would be able to synthesize his first treasure art. </p><p></p><p>The nine imperial arts were already incredibly powerful, so he couldn't imagine how formidable the legendary primal treasure arts must be. </p><p></p><p>He wondered if the Ning family, as a great clan, possessed any primal treasure arts.</p><p></p><p>Unfortunately, he had too many secrets now and couldn't casually reveal his identity. </p><p></p><p>Otherwise, he could try to get to know Ning Zhiyuan better and gain more knowledge about the divine clans from him. As the young master of a great family, Ning Zhiyuan's understanding of the divine world must far exceed that of ordinary cultivators.</p><p></p><p>On Ning Zhiyuan's side, he had reached the top floor but still could not find any information about the identity of the so-called Sword and Saber Immortal.</p><p></p><p>This left him greatly disappointed.</p><p></p><p>"Could it be that I really can't find that person? What a pity! Such a talented genius, if I could locate him, he would surely change the entire situation of the XuanYuan clan. What a shame."</p><p></p><p>But just then, the ring on his finger suddenly began to emit a few flashes of emerald green light.</p>

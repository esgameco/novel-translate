        <h1>Chapter 46</h1>
        <div class="content">
            <p>Here is the full English translation of the excerpt from the Chinese novel:</p><p></p><p>It was to protect one's own dignity when being bullied by others.</p><p></p><p>It was to protect the safety of loved ones and friends in times of danger.</p><p></p><p>If the martial way does not have a persistent meaning to sustain it, no matter how strong it becomes, it will ultimately become just a fine sword, merely a tool in the hands of others.</p><p></p><p>Ants can bear several times their own weight for the survival of the entire colony.</p><p></p><p>Martial artists, for the sake of a belief, can release energy that exceeds the inherent limits of the human body!</p><p></p><p>Wave after wave of energy was gradually released from Ye Xiao's body. The rain could no longer approach him, maintaining a distance of one centimeter, then one meter, two meters, ten meters, a hundred meters, a thousand meters...</p><p></p><p>An invisible energy wall was continuously forming and expanding in the void.</p><p></p><p>Before long, some pedestrians walking quickly nearby couldn't help but stop in their tracks.</p><p></p><p>"Ah! Why isn't it raining anymore?"</p><p>"Yes, why did the rain suddenly stop? It's still raining two kilometers away."</p><p></p><p>After a moment, Ye Xiao stood upright, and an even more powerful aura burst forth in an instant, directly shooting towards the sky, pushing all the rain clouds in the sky to quickly retreat towards the outskirts of the city.</p><p></p><p>The sun came out, shining on Ye Xiao's pale face, and a rainbow appeared in the sky, stunningly beautiful, attracting many girls to stop and take photos to post on their social media.</p><p></p><p>Ye Xiao stood with his hands behind his back, immersed in the feeling of breaking through to the Great Ancestor realm.</p><p></p><p>Unexpectedly, he did not feel much joy.</p><p></p><p>Perhaps, after breaking through to the Great Ancestor realm, his state of mind would also undergo a corresponding improvement, or it could be that the advancement of his state of mind had driven the improvement of his cultivation.</p><p></p><p>In any case, after becoming a Great Ancestor, his temperament seemed to have matured significantly compared to before.</p><p></p><p>When he had transmigrated here earlier, due to the torment of illness, he had died early, so his temperament had already surpassed that of his peers by a large margin. Now, his temperament had reached a level that ordinary people could not comprehend.</p><p></p><p>The Profound Heavenly Might was activated, and the spiritual power at the Great Ancestor level directly shielded the vision and thoughts of the people around him, making Ye Xiao disappear from their eyes at that moment.</p><p></p><p>Neither electronic instruments nor the vision and senses of living beings could detect Ye Xiao, even if he stood right in front of them, face to face.</p><p></p><p>After the spiritual power expanded, many places that could not be meticulously explored before due to insufficient spiritual power, as well as certain people, were now completely clear to Ye Xiao, as if he had placed cameras everywhere in Jianghai City.</p><p></p><p>"So he's here," Ye Xiao murmured, stepping forward and heading towards the great river outside Jianghai City.</p><p></p><p>This time, he was not stepping on the ground, but walking in the air!</p><p></p><p>It was as if there were invisible steps supporting his forward movement in the air.</p><p></p><p>This was one of the two hallmarks of a Great Ancestor - the ability to fly. The other hallmark was the ability to infuse attacks with spiritual power.</p><p></p><p>His speed was faster than before. Previously, if one looked closely, they could still see a faint afterimage of Ye Xiao, and from a high vantage point with a wide-angle view, they could even capture it.</p><p></p><p>It was like a Bugatti running at its limit, still unable to escape the control of human vision.</p><p></p><p>Now, ordinary people could no longer capture him with their own vision, and even martial artists above the fifth rank could only see a faint afterimage of him, just like the ordinary people before he became a Great Ancestor.</p><p></p><p>Unless one was above the Patriarch realm, it would be impossible to clearly see his movements.</p><p></p><p>And even if they saw him, so what? Without being a Great Ancestor, they would not be able to keep up with his actions. Seeing him would be meaningless.</p><p></p><p>Here is the full English translation of the excerpt from the Chinese novel:</p><p></p><p>It was of no use.</p><p></p><p>Ye Xiao came with the wind and finally landed by the river. In the distance, he could see a somewhat lonely and solitary figure sitting on the river embankment, burning a stack of paper money, with a long sword on his back, appearing particularly desolate.</p><p></p><p>Ye Xiao slowly walked up to him, and the other person turned back and looked at him with a slight smile - it was the librarian, Yang Zhengyi.</p><p></p><p>"It's no wonder it's you, you actually managed to find me." At this moment, Yang the manager was not wearing his usual suit, but a satin robe, a style from more than a hundred years ago. The robe was brand new, but the embroidery on it was clearly of an extraordinary level.</p><p></p><p>An ordinary person, or even a master, would not easily wear such exquisitely embroidered satin robes.</p><p></p><p>"Was it you who had someone send Gu Hai's message to me?"</p><p></p><p>"That's right."</p><p></p><p>"Was it also you who took the map of the Aier King?"</p><p></p><p>Yang Zhengyi did not speak, but sometimes silence is the best answer.</p><p></p><p>"In the legends recorded in the Star Sky, one of the divine patriarchs and grand patriarchs is you, isn't it?"</p><p></p><p>"I can feel the aura of the star beasts on you, but you are not a tiger beast, and you don't seem to be hostile to me. But why did you have to kill so many people?"</p><p></p><p>Yang Zhengyi took a sip of wine, and the wine jar was clearly very old, emitting a rich aroma of alcohol in the air.</p><p></p><p>"More than a hundred years ago, the various states rebelled, leading the star beasts to endanger the Nine Provinces.</p><p></p><p>In the turbulent times, the Nine Provinces were in chaos.</p><p></p><p>But in the Jianghai City, there was a foolish Taoist priest who led his disciples down the mountain to exorcise the demons.</p><p></p><p>In the end, he perished, and his disciples one by one fell into the underworld.</p><p></p><p>In that battle, the Taoist priest and his disciples paid an extremely heavy price, but they finally succeeded in suppressing the Aier King.</p><p></p><p>But ironically, the authorities, in order to enhance the spiritual energy of several cities including Jianghai City, did not kill the Aier King, but instead divided and sealed it, using its vital energy to nourish the spiritual energy of these cities.</p><p></p><p>Using powerful star beasts to nourish the spiritual energy of cities is something that is strictly prohibited worldwide, so the deeds of those Taoist priests were not even allowed to be recorded.</p><p></p><p>Little Ye, do you think those Taoist priests were foolish?"</p><p></p><p>Ye Xiao replied calmly:</p><p></p><p>"Yes, they were quite foolish, but I think you are even more foolish."</p><p></p><p>"Why?"</p><p></p><p>"If I were you, whoever dares to offend me, no matter how exalted their position or how strong their power, I would kill their entire family.</p><p></p><p>Grudges have a source, debts have an owner.</p><p></p><p>Those powerful and influential people who you are not daring to touch, but instead have killed so many ordinary people, how are you different from a coward?"</p><p></p><p>Yang Zhengyi smiled.</p><p></p><p>"Not to mention the past, if it were not for us suppressing the Aier King, Jianghai City would not know how many people would have died.</p><p></p><p>Just in these past few years, Jianghai City has greatly increased in spiritual energy due to the nourishment of the Aier King. All the humans in Jianghai City are beneficiaries, so how can they be considered innocent? I used their lifeblood to revive the Aier King, which can also be seen as compensation for my teacher and many fellow disciples who sacrificed themselves.</p><p></p><p>This is the offering they should have made!"</p><p></p><p>As he spoke, his expression gradually turned cold.</p><p></p><p>"For more than a hundred years, I have had the same nightmare every night, dreaming that my teacher and fellow disciples are begging me in hell to avenge them and kill the Aier King! I have waited for more than a hundred years for this day! Even if I have to sacrifice all the people in Jianghai City, I will not hesitate!"</p><p></p><p>This is the first update, please support the new book.</p><p></p><p>(End of this chapter)</p>

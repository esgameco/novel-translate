        <h1>Chapter 26</h1>
        <div class="content">
            <p>Here is the full English translation of the Chinese excerpt:</p><p></p><p>Pao Jiansheng's feet stepped into the formation of the Seven Star Big Dipper, transforming from holding the sword with one hand to holding it with both hands, standing upright before him.</p><p></p><p>A bitterly cold sword intent continuously erupted forth.</p><p></p><p>One second! Two seconds!</p><p></p><p>Three seconds!</p><p></p><p>He moved! His speed was extremely fast, disappearing from the original spot in almost an instant.</p><p></p><p>The gazes of the crowd could not keep up with his speed, and could only judge his reappearance location based on the direction of his advance.</p><p></p><p>At the moment Pao Jiansheng made his move, Qin Yuyan also moved.</p><p></p><p>She bent her waist, coiling up her strength to unleash it.</p><p></p><p>She had comprehended Ye Xiao's sword intent, and it was now particularly clear in her mind.</p><p></p><p>Only at the brink of life and death could she better perceive and comprehend that sword intent.</p><p></p><p>The sword, the overlord among weapons!</p><p></p><p>Regardless of who the opponent was, she would sweep away everything before her with an unstoppable momentum. Although she was a step behind Pao Jiansheng, the sword intent easily made up for the difference.</p><p></p><p>The crowd only felt the two figures flash, and in the next moment, a thunderous explosion suddenly erupted throughout the martial arts hall.</p><p></p><p>Boom! The massive explosion and the resulting shockwaves left countless students shaken, their figures unsteady.</p><p></p><p>Even Dou Changfeng and the others, though their cultivation was extremely strong and unaffected by the disturbance, were deeply shocked.</p><p></p><p>Geniuses are indeed geniuses!</p><p></p><p>The two had suppressed their cultivation to the Fifth-Grade Warrior realm, yet they could still unleash such combat power, which was at least comparable to the Sixth-Grade Warrior realm.</p><p></p><p>This was a power that ordinary people at the limits of their lives might not even be able to unleash.</p><p></p><p>When the disturbance subsided and the crowd stabilized their figures, Pao Jiansheng had already arrived at the spot where Qin Yuyan had just stood, while Qin Yuyan had also moved to where he had just been, the two standing back-to-back.</p><p></p><p>The entire martial arts hall was deathly silent, all eyes wide open, not daring to even breathe, only the sound of heartbeats echoing in their minds.</p><p></p><p>One second...</p><p></p><p>Two seconds.</p><p></p><p>Three seconds.</p><p></p><p>Four seconds.</p><p></p><p>Five seconds.</p><p></p><p>"Pu-chi!"</p><p></p><p>Finally, Qin Yuyan spat out a mouthful of fresh blood and collapsed.</p><p></p><p>"Cough, cough..."</p><p></p><p>A trace of fresh blood also slowly seeped out from the corner of Pao Jiansheng's mouth, but he still stood, indicating that he had won!</p><p></p><p>Qin Yuyan had still lost, but with only two months of sword cultivation, to be able to fight against Pao Jiansheng's over twenty years of sword dao, who could say she had not won?</p><p></p><p>Qin Shenglong and Dou Changfeng quickly rushed to Qin Yuyan's side, with Dou Changfeng infusing her with spiritual energy to heal her injuries and check on her condition.</p><p></p><p>"Little girl, how are you?" Qin Shenglong asked with a worried expression.</p><p></p><p>Qin Yuyan gave an apologetic smile.</p><p></p><p>"I'm sorry, Grandpa, I've embarrassed you."</p><p></p><p>Qin Shenglong tightly grasped Qin Yuyan's small hand, shaking his head repeatedly, his eyes reddening with emotion.</p><p></p><p>"Silly girl, you did great, you are the pride of the Qin family."</p><p></p><p>Dou Changfeng smiled calmly: "It's nothing serious, just a disturbance in her qi and blood, her meridians are unharmed. With some recuperation, she'll be fine."</p><p></p><p>Hearing these words, Qin Shenglong finally let out a sigh of relief.</p><p></p><p>Pao Jiansheng wiped the blood from the corner of his mouth and slowly walked up to Qin Yuyan, nodding towards her and saying, "Thank you, this is the most meaningful battle I've encountered in the Nine Provinces. If you had cultivated the sword art for a little longer, perhaps we could have fought another round."</p><p></p><p>Qin Yuyan nodded.</p><p></p><p>"Thank you for the compliment, your sword dao prowess is indeed as renowned as its reputation!"</p><p></p><p>The two exchanged a smile, and thunderous applause erupted throughout the venue.</p><p></p><p>Both Pao Jiansheng's strength and Qin Yuyan's efforts were worthy of applause.</p><p></p><p>Afterwards, Pao Jiansheng bid farewell to the crowd and left with Captain Jin, as his sword dao challenge would continue.</p><p></p><p>Here is my translation of the Chinese excerpt:</p><p></p><p>Until he encounters someone who can defeat him!</p><p></p><p>The video of the two competing was also sent to the forum and quickly became a hot topic.</p><p></p><p>Qin Yuyan was then taken by her grandfather and the dean to the dean's office.</p><p></p><p>"Yuyan, tell grandpa honestly, who taught you your swordsmanship? Was it the senior from our Jianghai City?"</p><p></p><p>Qin Yuyan nodded, saying she had intuitively grasped the other person's sword intent and learned their swordsmanship.</p><p></p><p>"I knew it would be him!" </p><p></p><p>Qin Shenglong slammed his fist into his left palm, his eyes shining with excitement.</p><p></p><p>"Then where is your master? Quickly take us to see him!"</p><p></p><p>Qin Yuyan's face fell.</p><p></p><p>"I really don't know who he is or where he is."</p><p></p><p>"How is that possible? If you're his disciple, how can you not know who he is?"</p><p></p><p>Qin Yuyan nodded, then shook her head.</p><p></p><p>"That day I was cultivating by the river, and I happened to witness his breakthrough. I asked him to take me as his disciple, but he said he doesn't accept disciples. I've been slowly comprehending his sword intent on my own. But my mind may be a bit slow, and so far I've only grasped about 2% of it."</p><p></p><p>The two old men were completely dumbfounded, stunned into speechlessness. </p><p></p><p>With just 2% of the sword intent, Qin Yuyan's swordsmanship had already reached such a level? This was a bit too much of an anomaly. After all, with just that tiny bit of sword intent, Qin Yuyan had already shocked Park Jeongsaeng and made him bleed from the mouth. If she gained a few more percent, wouldn't she be able to match Park Jeongsaeng? A little more and she could even defeat him in seconds?</p><p></p><p>"What an extraordinary person!" </p><p></p><p>Dou Changfeng couldn't help but sigh deeply.</p><p></p><p>"Before I thought he might be a quasi-divine cultivator, but now it seems his cultivation is even beyond that!"</p><p></p><p>"What?!" </p><p></p><p>Qin Shenglong exclaimed, his face flushing from the intense excitement. </p><p></p><p>This was unimaginable. Beyond quasi-divine cultivators, that would mean...</p><p></p><p>Although the man had not taken Qin Yuyan as his disciple, he had imparted a sword intent to her - this was an incredible fortune!</p><p></p><p>At this moment, Dou Changfeng's phone suddenly rang. </p><p></p><p>He waved the phone to signal the grandfather and granddaughter, then stepped aside to answer the call.</p><p></p><p>Qin Yuyan carefully looked at her grandfather.</p><p></p><p>"Grandpa, can I from now on cultivate the sword art?"</p><p></p><p>"Of course! From your generation on, the Qin family will no longer practice the sword, but will focus on the sword art. In the future, you can wholeheartedly cultivate the sword art, and grandpa will fully support you!"</p><p></p><p>Qin Yuyan finally let out a sigh of relief.</p><p></p><p>"Thank you, grandpa."</p><p></p><p>A moment later, Dou Changfeng came back, his face beaming.</p><p></p><p>"Guess who called me?"</p><p></p><p>"Who?" </p><p></p><p>Qin Shenglong couldn't help but ask. Dou Changfeng replied mysteriously:</p><p></p><p>"Our dean! He wants to specially invite Yuyan to study at Jingdu University!"</p><p></p><p>"Really?" </p><p></p><p>Qin Shenglong's beard started trembling from his excitement. </p><p></p><p>That was Jingdu, the place that students from all over the country dreamed of going to.</p><p></p><p>"If I'm not mistaken, other top martial arts academies in the country will also be looking for you soon. This time, Yuyan has truly become famous."</p><p></p><p>"Good! Good! Good!"</p><p></p><p>Qin Shenglong exclaimed "good" several times in a row, excited.</p><p></p><p>"Our Qin family has produced a talent this time!"</p>

        <h1>Chapter 122</h1>
        <div class="content">
            <p>Here is the full English translation of the Chinese excerpt:</p><p></p><p>Every morning, he enjoyed the small steamed buns from Hucheng, the donkey meat buns from Tiancheng. At noon, he had the big plate chicken from Xincheng, the roujiamo (meat sandwich) from Shaanxi, and the beef soup from Huaicheng. In the evening, he had the old duck soup from Jinling and the fried pancake from Shancheng. All the famous delicacies from the major prefectures were at his service, allowing him to live a carefree life.</p><p></p><p>This further strengthened Ye Xiao's determination to not let the Star Beasts disrupt the peace of Jianghai City. </p><p></p><p>If this divine life were to be lost, it would certainly be a great distress.</p><p></p><p>Apart from his regular meals, Ye Xiao spent the rest of his time immersed in reading books in the library, in order to enhance his own strength.</p><p></p><p>He had already grasped the essentials of eight sets of foundation star formations, and it would not be long before he could fully integrate them.</p><p></p><p>However, the foolish cat Huanliu had gone silent.</p><p></p><p>Ye Xiao had left a trace of spiritual power on her, so he was not worried that she would slack off and then come back to deceive him.</p><p></p><p>The spiritual power indication showed that she had indeed been busy running around these days, but the level of concealment of the other party exceeded his expectations, so he had not been able to find her.</p><p></p><p>This made Ye Xiao somewhat regretful.</p><p></p><p>He now wished that he had not used the Taixuan Tiangong attack in the hospital.</p><p></p><p>The Taixuan Tiangong was a spiritual power attack. After cultivating it, his spiritual power became very strong, allowing him to directly blast apart physical entities with spiritual power.</p><p></p><p>But its essence still belonged to the spiritual cultivation method.</p><p></p><p>Because it was a spiritual cultivation method, if one was not careful, it could completely shatter the enemy's soul.</p><p></p><p>As a result, the other party did not even leave a trace of soul behind, so naturally, it could not be repaired using the Chengxing Technique or the Chenxing Incantation.</p><p></p><p>Lesson learned, he would use this move less often against enemies in the future.</p><p></p><p>Otherwise, if he had used the healing technique to repair the souls of those two half-beasts, and then used the Taixuan Tiangong to search their souls, how convenient would that have been? Next time, he would consider researching some new ways of attacking.</p><p></p><p>For example, using spiritual energy to make a drill and drill a hole in the Star Beast's head.</p><p></p><p>Or cutting off the other party's arms and legs, to the point where they would not die, and then storing them in the storage ring.</p><p></p><p>This way, he could use soul searching to extract some useful information.</p><p></p><p>At this time, as the day of the Seven-Star Convergence approached, there were more and more armed warriors on the streets.</p><p></p><p>There were also many hired warriors from the mercenary companies who had been summoned back and were stationed in groups in the city. </p><p></p><p>Even the Star Beasts within the city had been completely cleared out, and the people were not overly careless.</p><p></p><p>Years of battles with the Star Beasts had taught them the cunning and intelligence of the Star Beasts. No one knew what kind of tricks the Star Beasts might have.</p><p></p><p>If one was careless, there was a real possibility of people dying.</p><p></p><p>However, the solemn atmosphere did not affect Ye Xiao at all.</p><p></p><p>He couldn't be called arrogant, but even with the arrival of the Seven-Star Convergence, the only existence that could truly concern him was probably the one at the peak of the Grand Ancestor Realm, such as the Aer King.</p><p></p><p>As for those low-level Star Beasts, they were like little flies to him - he could swat them dead with a single slap, without any challenge at all.</p><p></p><p>After about half a month, Ye Xiao finally gathered the ten basic formation techniques and could begin the integration.</p><p></p><p>On the golden book of his divine soul, all the papers related to the formations had turned golden due to his reaching the Great Perfection realm, emanating a rich golden glow.</p><p></p><p>Ye Xiao commanded his divine soul to perform the synthesis. The ten basic formation techniques quickly condensed into ten characters:</p><p></p><p>Hooking! Drawing! Twisting! Pulling! Tearing! Dotting! Inserting! </p><p></p><p>A bunch of strange and obscure terms that were hard to understand.</p><p></p><p>Oh well, the important thing was the synthesis.</p><p></p><p>Here is the full English translation of the Chinese excerpt:</p><p></p><p>The ten golden characters fused into one, and in the blink of an eye, a brand new imperial-level formation was formed - the Heaven-Spanning Transformation Formation.</p><p></p><p>Hehe, another very fitting name.</p><p></p><p>This golden book is indeed a terrible namer.</p><p></p><p>After the golden book was synthesized, it immediately entered a cultivation state.</p><p></p><p>After one night, the golden book had already completed its cultivation.</p><p></p><p>The next morning, Ye Xiao woke up refreshed from his sleep, not bothering with the bulging quilt that looked like a small mosquito net, and immediately began to calm his mind and start to understand the Heaven-Spanning Transformation Formation.</p><p></p><p>Simply put, all the formations in the world are extracted from the star cores of star beasts, but the source of the formation's power is to imitate the positions of the celestial stars in the heavens, creating an gravitational field that attracts and controls the surrounding spiritual energy, just like an electromagnetic field, attracting all the spiritual energy and then creating a special attack or defense, or illusion mode.</p><p></p><p>Deploying a formation requires three basic elements: one is a spirit stone or star beast star core infused with spiritual energy, two is a special formation line pattern, and three is an appropriate amount of the cultivator's essence blood.</p><p></p><p>Spirit stones and star cores are the fundamental basis of the formation, providing the basic energy, then activating the formation line pattern, absorbing spiritual energy, and causing the formation to run continuously.</p><p></p><p>This concept is roughly equivalent to starting a car, where at first the battery is used to drive it, and then the engine is started to keep it running.</p><p></p><p>As for the essence blood of the formation deployer, it is used to control the grand formation. A grand formation without a master will certainly not act according to one's will.</p><p></p><p>The Heaven-Spanning Transformation Formation is both an independent formation and a combined formation of multiple formations.</p><p></p><p>It encompasses the Yin-Yang Five Elements, illusion formations, and attack formations, belonging to a grand slaughter formation.</p><p></p><p>Its defensive capability is quite ordinary, but it is still at the imperial formation level, and it also barely possesses some capabilities.</p><p></p><p>After all, it is a grand slaughter formation, mainly focused on wielding slaughter, as long as it is given enough spiritual energy supply, it may even be able to trap and even destroy a Saint Sovereign.</p><p></p><p>The prerequisite is to have enough spiritual energy supply.</p><p></p><p>That is to say, good star cores or a large number of spirit stones are required.</p><p></p><p>Ye Xiao estimates that to destroy a Saint Sovereign, at the very least, he would need quite a few Patriarch-level star beast star cores, or hundreds of thousands of spirit stones, in order to complete it.</p><p></p><p>It can only be said that using formations to enhance will reduce some losses and ensure a certain success rate of killing, but it is not omnipotent.</p><p></p><p>It's like having a knife in your hand, it's definitely easier to kill someone than with bare hands, but it's not a hundred percent guarantee of killing.</p><p></p><p>Of course, there are differences in the knives as well.</p><p></p><p>Ordinary formations are like rusted broken knives, while Ye Xiao's formations are like alloy steel knives!</p><p></p><p>Alloy steel knives are definitely a hundred times stronger than rusted broken knives.</p><p></p><p>After learning the formations, the first thing he did was to replace the formation on his storage ring with the Heaven-Spanning Transformation Formation.</p><p></p><p>This storage ring was originally forged by divine craftsmanship, but due to insufficient materials, it has not yet reached the standard of an imperial treasure, and needs to add more materials in the future.</p><p></p><p>But it has already surpassed the level of an ordinary Patriarch-grade treasure, and has a faint ability to automatically absorb spiritual energy. Even if it is lost, it will automatically run the formation to prevent theft by others.</p><p></p><p>In this way, although it is not yet perfect, in the short term, it is enough for his own use.</p><p></p><p>After doing all this, Ye Xiao let out a long sigh, and the corners of his mouth slightly lifted.</p><p></p><p>Another small goal has been accomplished, perfect.</p><p></p><p>This is the first update, please recommend.</p><p></p><p>Thank you to the reader "Yijian Zhi" for the reward, I am deeply grateful.</p><p></p><p>(This chapter is complete)</p>

        <h1>Chapter 226</h1>
        <div class="content">
            <p>Here is the full English translation of the Chinese excerpt:</p><p></p><p>"Please spare me, waaah."</p><p></p><p>In the empty and dilapidated factory, the young girl knelt on the ground, pleading with the man in the black robe before her.</p><p></p><p>She was no longer human in appearance, her body covered in fresh blood and mud, like a dirty little dog in the rain.</p><p></p><p>But the man in the black robe showed no mercy, instead looking at her with a mocking expression.</p><p></p><p>"Spare you? Should I spare you, when no one will spare my subordinates who were slaughtered by the human race? If it weren't for you, the human race would never have discovered my subordinates. They're all dead, so you should join them in the afterlife."</p><p></p><p>"It wasn't me, it has nothing to do with me, I was completely knocked out at the time and had no idea they were my subordinates, I didn't report them either."</p><p></p><p>"You don't need to try and deceive me with these sweet words, your only use now is to entertain me."</p><p></p><p>With that, he stepped on her arm.</p><p></p><p>"Crack—!"</p><p></p><p>"Ahhh—!"</p><p></p><p>The heart-wrenching scream scared away the crows around, causing them to caw.</p><p></p><p>It was a full hour later when the man in the robe finally emerged from the dilapidated factory.</p><p></p><p>"They really can't withstand being played with, the human race is still too weak. It's a pity I can't directly go find some Saint Monarch-level human experts to play with, otherwise I could have had even more fun."</p><p></p><p>He smacked his lips and wiped his fangs.</p><p></p><p>"Oh well, I should focus on the overall situation of the Star Beast Clan first, and hold back for now. I'll deal with the other two humans first."</p><p></p><p>He took out two pieces of paper from his pocket.</p><p></p><p>"Ye Xiao, Yang Xin, they're actually living together, perfect. This way I don't have to run back and forth, I can capture them all at once."</p><p></p><p>With that, he lightly stepped and vanished on the spot.</p><p></p><p>Time quickly arrived at noon the next day, and after finishing his advanced cultivation class, Ye Xiao hurried to the library.</p><p></p><p>He only had one month for his further studies, and a third of that time had already passed. In the remaining two ten-day periods, he had to return to Jianghai City.</p><p></p><p>He must try to read as many books as possible before returning to Jianghai City.</p><p></p><p>Moreover, although Professor Huang hasn't asked for his card back now, that doesn't mean he won't do so at other times.</p><p></p><p>If the borrowing card is taken back, he won't be able to continue going to the upper floors of the library.</p><p></p><p>So his time was extremely precious.</p><p></p><p>Today, Ye Xiao came to the fifth floor.</p><p></p><p>The books on the fifth floor were better than the lower floors, and the access to information was also more extensive.</p><p></p><p>For example, here Ye Xiao finally saw records related to Imperial Arts and Royal Realm.</p><p></p><p>Cultivation methods could raise one's cultivation to a certain limit according to their different grades.</p><p></p><p>Cultivation methods below the Transcendent level could at most only raise one's cultivation to the Innate Ninth Realm, which was the limit.</p><p></p><p>Saint Monarch-level cultivation methods could cover the entire Saint Monarch, Grand Saint, and Saint Monarch Realms.</p><p></p><p>The Imperial Arts could encompass the Royal Realm and the Emperor Realm, the two great realms.</p><p></p><p>Of course, the final result of cultivation depended not only on the cultivation method, but also on one's innate talent.</p><p></p><p>If there was no suitable cultivation method, no matter how strong one's talent was, they could not break through.</p><p></p><p>For example, without the Imperial Arts, one could never advance to the Royal Realm and Emperor Realm, and could only wander in the Saint Monarch Realm for life.</p><p></p><p>And if one's talent was not enough, even if given an Imperial Arts, they might not be able to cultivate to the Saint Monarch Realm.</p><p></p><p>The two were indispensable.</p><p></p><p>Then there was the division of cultivation levels in the Royal Realm and Emperor Realm.</p><p></p><p>In this aspect, there was a difference between the human race and the Star Beasts.</p><p></p><p>The human race directly called them the Royal Realm and Emperor Realm, while the Star Beast Clan called themselves Divine Beasts, or Divine Realm.</p><p></p><p>The Star Beasts were above the Royal Realm, divided into Divine Beasts and Super Divine Beasts!</p><p></p><p>Among them, the Divine Beasts (Divine Realm) corresponded to the Royal Realm of the human race, while the Super Divine corresponded to the Emperor Realm experts.</p><p></p><p>It might sound a bit confusing, but Ye Xiao felt it was quite normal.</p><p></p><p>After all, the two were different races, and while the cultivation levels might be equivalent, the names could not be the same.</p><p></p><p>Just like the people of the Nine States say "no", while the people of Yingzhou say "ya no".</p><p></p><p>However, Ye Xiao also saw an interesting piece of information.</p><p></p><p>There was a ranking on the Star Battlefield, called the Star Ranking.</p><p></p><p>It recorded the top experts of both the human race and the Star Beast Clan.</p><p></p><p>Of course, these experts were the current combatants, not those who remained in the depths of the Star Realm and had not come to this world.</p><p></p><p>They were judged by the number of Royal Realm and Divine Beast experts they had defeated.</p><p></p><p>Those who could enter the Star Ranking were absolutely powerful experts, any one of whom could easily sweep away all the human race experts on the ground if they came down. Because to enter the Star Ranking, one had to be at least above the Royal Realm, and merely reaching the Royal Realm might not be enough to qualify.</p><p></p><p>This information allowed Ye Xiao to have a clearer understanding of the experts in this world.</p><p></p><p>He also finally understood why the Star Beasts would descend to the Star Battlefield every sixty years.</p><p></p><p>Here is the full English translation of the Chinese excerpt:</p><p></p><p>In the starry sky, things like the Shen Zong (Divine Emperor) no longer amount to much.</p><p></p><p>The intensity of the star battlefield has far exceeded the imagination of the people on the ground.</p><p></p><p>The pressure they are facing is unprecedented.</p><p></p><p>No wonder the human race used to have emperors and ordinary Diwang (Celestial Realm) experts, but the war with the Star Beasts has not stopped.</p><p></p><p>There are too many Star Beasts, and too many experts.</p><p></p><p>After reviewing this information, Ye Xiao also began to collect the remaining eye techniques, wanting to create a more powerful eye technique for himself.</p><p></p><p>As the saying goes, the more skills you have, the less you will be weighed down. The more things you know, the more you can surprise your enemies.</p><p></p><p>When the beast calamity arrives, he will have a better chance of surviving.</p><p></p><p>After searching for more than two hours, Ye Xiao found two more eye techniques, this time not the divination technique that just explored, but an explosion technique and an illusion technique.</p><p></p><p>The explosion technique, as the name suggests, is to unleash an eye technique at the place the gaze is focused, and then directly cause an explosive impact.</p><p></p><p>The illusion technique can make the enemy enter a state of hallucination.</p><p></p><p>These two eye technique skills are at the Zongshi (Patriarch) level.</p><p></p><p>They may seem impressive, but for Ye Xiao, they are mostly just trash, not suitable for refining into Emperor Techniques. For example, the illusion technique, Ye Xiao now has the Taixuan Tiangong technique, a spiritual technique, which can also be used to cast illusions, and the power is even stronger, almost an instant kill.</p><p></p><p>These two techniques can only serve as basic techniques, as materials for Ye Xiao to refine.</p><p></p><p>Just as Ye Xiao was reading the book, an old man in a white silk robe came to his opposite.</p><p></p><p>"Young man, do you mind if I sit here?"</p><p></p><p>Ye Xiao just swept him with the Taixuan Tiangong, and knew his appearance - white beard, wearing something similar to the elderly's exercise clothes in the park, and his cultivation was somewhat unfathomable.</p><p></p><p>This was quite interesting, because theoretically, although after reaching the Zongshi level, one can already conceal one's aura and cultivation.</p><p></p><p>But for a Zongshi or a Grand Zongshi, in the face of a Shen Zong expert, it would definitely be impossible to hide.</p><p></p><p>The gap in strength between the two is simply too great.</p><p></p><p>Yet this person was able to shield his own scan, which was enough to show that his strength was extraordinary. Absolutely above the Xiantian Qipin (Innate Seventh Grade), at the Shen Zong level.</p><p></p><p>But Ye Xiao didn't pay much attention to it, he just nodded his head without even looking up.</p><p></p><p>No matter how strong the other party's strength is, it has nothing to do with him. It's better to focus on cultivating his own techniques and enhancing his own strength, rather than gossiping about other people's cultivation.</p><p></p><p>Moreover, this is the Zhongzhou City, one of the top few cities among the Nine Provinces, so the appearance of a Shen Zong level expert is not surprising.</p><p></p><p>However, the other party seemed to have some interest in him, and the old man sat down and asked curiously, "Are you also interested in eye techniques?"</p><p></p><p>Ye Xiao paused for a moment, then raised his head and glanced at him.</p><p></p><p>In this glance, he noticed that the other party's eyes were somewhat unusual, with a faint greenish tint in the pupils.</p><p></p><p>His gaze flickered, but soon returned to normal.</p><p></p><p>The other party was actually a cultivator of eye techniques.</p><p></p><p>Quite interesting.</p><p></p><p>Among the Shen Zong and above level, he had only encountered one eye technique cultivator before, and that was Xia Bingning in the Southwest Forest Sea.</p><p></p><p>He didn't expect to meet a second one here.</p><p></p><p>"It's just that I feel a little curious, that's all."</p><p></p><p>The old man smiled slightly.</p><p></p><p>"It's not that simple to be just curious, is it? On the first day you came to the library, you were looking for information about eye techniques on the first floor, and then you started reading books about eye techniques. Although you later looked at soul refining techniques, you are now looking at books about eye techniques again.</p><p></p><p>You should be planning to cultivate eye techniques, right? Although the old man shouldn't be so nosy, the martial dao should not be greedy for too many things.</p><p></p><p>It's better to find a single martial dao and cultivate it to the extreme."</p><p></p><p>Ye Xiao narrowed his eyes slightly.</p><p></p><p>Well, he has encountered a tough opponent today.</p><p></p><p>He actually noticed Ye Xiao's movements in the library all these days? Quite interesting.</p><p></p><p>Although Ye Xiao didn't want to overly boast about himself, but now in the world, those who can reach this level should be countable on one's fingers.</p><p></p><p>This old man has some abilities.</p><p></p><p>The two looked at each other, and a powerful force seemed to be unfolding between them, opposing each other.</p><p></p><p>In the vast library, only the two of them could feel each other, and no one else could sense them.</p><p></p><p>This was a contest, not a contest of life and death, but if one side lost, it definitely wouldn't be good.</p><p></p><p>At this time, neither of them could withdraw, because no one could guarantee that the other party would not launch a sneak attack in the next second.</p><p></p><p>However, after about ten minutes, Ye Xiao suddenly withdrew his aura, and gathered all his power to protect the surface of his body.</p>

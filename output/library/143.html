        <h1>Chapter 143</h1>
        <div class="content">
            <p>Here is the full English translation of the Chinese excerpt:</p><p></p><p>"After all, a grandmaster-level cultivation technique can already allow a talented genius to cultivate to the Divine Realm."</p><p></p><p>"I've read before that there are even stronger techniques above the grandmaster-level ones. Is that true?"</p><p></p><p>Fa Zheng paused for a moment, then nodded.</p><p></p><p>"Yes, that's right. Above the grandmaster-level techniques, there is a technique called the Imperial Art!</p><p></p><p>It is rumored that by cultivating the Imperial Art, one can reach the legendary Imperial Realm.</p><p></p><p>This involves another level of cultivation.</p><p></p><p>This level is not known to ordinary people, because the existence that can reach that realm is extremely rare.</p><p></p><p>They are the top combat forces of the human race."</p><p></p><p>"Above the Divine Realm is the Imperial Realm? The ancient emperors?"</p><p></p><p>"No, above the Divine Realm is the Royal Realm! And above the Royal Realm is the Imperial Realm.</p><p></p><p>The term 'emperor' does not refer to a cultivation level, but rather to one who can activate the great fortune of humanity when a crisis approaches.</p><p></p><p>How to put it...</p><p></p><p>This poor monk does not understand it very clearly, I only know that after reaching the peak of the Imperial Realm, human cultivation will be constrained by certain laws. Either they break through to an even stronger level, or they will fall into ashes.</p><p></p><p>As for what that level is, this poor monk does not know, for it is beyond my comprehension.</p><p></p><p>However, it is said that the Patriarch Bodhidharma of our Buddhist sect seems to be an existence that has transcended the Imperial Realm, but he is a very ancient being, so I cannot confirm if it is true or not.</p><p></p><p>I only know that the emperor seems to be an existence that can transcend that rule constraint, meaning that after surpassing the ordinary Imperial Realm, the emperor's cultivation will not be suppressed by the rules, and they can continue to endlessly improve their cultivation and unleash even greater combat power.</p><p></p><p>This is also why humanity so yearns for the emperor."</p><p></p><p>Ye Xiao was shocked, not expecting that above the Divine Realm, there were two great realms - the Royal Realm and the Imperial Realm. </p><p></p><p>And above the Imperial Realm, there was an even more powerful and mysterious existence.</p><p></p><p>The Imperial Art can already cultivate one to the Imperial Realm, so wouldn't that mean the cultivation technique practiced by the existence above the Imperial Realm is likely the fusion of the Imperial Art? This made Ye Xiao's heart burn with excitement.</p><p></p><p>It also gave him a deeper desire to pursue that unknown, mysterious realm.</p><p></p><p>But Ye Xiao soon reacted.</p><p></p><p>"Wait, you just said that at the peak of the Imperial Realm, one will be constrained by the rules. But if they can break through to an even higher level, wouldn't they no longer be bound by the rules? Wouldn't they be able to unleash powers even greater than ordinary Imperial Realm cultivators, and protect humanity?"</p><p></p><p>"In theory, that's how it should be. But there is a rumor that after breaking through that limitation, they will also disappear from this world.</p><p></p><p>And in fact, those who can cultivate to the Imperial Realm are already extremely few, while those who can break through above the Imperial Realm are even more rare, with the majority turning to ashes.</p><p></p><p>Perhaps there have been one or two in history who broke through that level, but the records of the human race barely have any about the Imperial Realm, let alone higher realms.</p><p></p><p>So we really don't know what the situation is above the Imperial Realm."</p><p></p><p>"I see."</p><p></p><p>Ye Xiao had a vague idea in his mind.</p><p></p><p>It seems that breaking through to the realms above the Imperial Realm carries great risks, and even if one succeeds, the future is unknown. However, the ordinary Imperial Realm should only require the Imperial Art.</p><p></p><p>His Golden Book Spiritual Consciousness, he wonders if he can fuse it into an even higher-level technique. </p><p></p><p>If he can condense an even higher-level technique, perhaps he can break through that limitation, who knows.</p><p></p><p>And that emperor, he is truly tempting.</p><p></p><p>With the great fortune of the human race protecting him, he can cultivate without being bound by the rules, and continuously grow stronger, it's like cheating! The question is, will Ye Xiao have that luck to become an emperor?</p><p></p><p>Since Ye Xiao doesn't like taking risks much, compared to the ordinary Imperial Realm that requires breaking through trials, he would prefer to become an emperor and win without effort.</p><p></p><p>In the past few days, Ye Xiao has read some books in the library and has a weak understanding of the emperor.</p><p></p><p>When a crisis befalls the human race, many saints and saintesses will be born into the world. As long as they break through to beyond the Grandmaster Realm, they will display celestial anomalies.</p><p></p><p>These people will receive strong support from the nation, go through arduous growth, overcome countless dangers, and need to have the great fortune of the world on their side, in order to have a chance to become the rare emperor of the human race in the end.</p><p></p><p>The human race has had many saints and saintesses appear in the past few hundred years, but no emperor has emerged.</p><p></p><p>From this perspective, Ye Xiao doesn't have much confidence in himself.</p><p></p><p>Because he has already broken through to the Divine Realm, but has never displayed any anomalies.</p><p></p><p>Not even once.</p><p></p><p>With such a self, it is almost impossible for him to become an emperor.</p><p></p><p>It's a bit frustrating, as it means his luck is not good enough, that he has such a good system but doesn't have the qualifications to activate it.</p><p></p><p>He really wants to know what kind of amazing and extraordinary people can qualify to become saints and saintesses! To have the talent and abilities worthy of becoming the legendary emperor, their gifts must be...</p><p></p><p>Here is my translation of the Chinese excerpt:</p><p></p><p>Knowing how far one has reached.</p><p></p><p>How do I compare to the Holy Son and Holy Daughter? Am I stronger or weaker?</p><p></p><p>Seeing Ye Xiao eating a bit absentmindedly, Fa Zheng chuckled and comforted him, "Don't think too much about that. Those kinds of people are one in hundreds of millions, or even billions, to come by.</p><p></p><p>For us ordinary people, to cultivate to the level of a Sect Master is already a heavenly blessing.</p><p></p><p>If by chance, we can cultivate to the Divine Sect, that would be the accumulated fortune of dozens of generations."</p><p></p><p>Ye Xiao nodded.</p><p></p><p>That's right, the path must be taken one step at a time, the meal eaten one bite at a time. Who knows what the future holds? Just focus on the present, work hard and live each day well, that's enough.</p><p></p><p>Moreover, with the Godly Tome Spirit Soul, the future surely won't be too bad.</p><p></p><p>Speaking of which, even if I can't become an Emperor, I can consider learning the Emperor Technique.</p><p></p><p>The Shaolin Martial Arts Academy should have Emperor Techniques, right?</p><p></p><p>Thinking of this, Ye Xiao casually said, "By the way, Shaolin should have many Emperor Techniques, right?"</p><p></p><p>Fa Zheng shook his head. </p><p></p><p>"Shaolin does have Emperor Techniques, but I'm not sure exactly how many. </p><p></p><p>Emperor Techniques, things that far surpass the mundane, even Shaolin couldn't possibly have too many. It's not like food, where you can grab a big handful. </p><p></p><p>This humble monk has also heard the elders in the temple speak of this.</p><p></p><p>We Shaolin have an unsurpassed inner cultivation method called the Dharma Sutra, created by the Patriarch, whose absorption of spiritual energy is as terrifying as a whirlpool in the sea. But only the Abbot of each generation has the chance to cultivate it.</p><p></p><p>There is also an extremely powerful palm technique - the Tathagata Divine Palm! But due to the many attacks by stellar beasts on the Central Plains over the past two hundred years, resulting in the fall of many Shaolin experts, the Tathagata Divine Palm has long been lost.</p><p></p><p>Apart from that, there is a not-so-rare body refining technique - the Indestructible Vajra Body Skill. Currently, two or three of our senior monks should be cultivating this."</p><p></p><p>Ye Xiao was stunned.</p><p></p><p>The Indestructible Vajra Body Skill is actually from Shaolin? No, that's not quite right, Shaolin's techniques were also refined from the stellar cores of the stellar beasts. </p><p></p><p>So it can't be completely considered Shaolin's, it can only be said to belong to the universe.</p><p></p><p>But he didn't expect Shaolin to actually have several Emperor Techniques. This is a good idea for Ye Xiao.</p><p></p><p>If he can learn them, perhaps he can fuse them to create something even beyond the Emperor Techniques.</p><p></p><p>"By the way, Ye Disciple, have you considered joining our Buddhist Sect?</p><p></p><p>Recently, the Buddhist Sect has been establishing a branch at the Martial Arts Academy in Jianghai City, providing some good resources.</p><p></p><p>Apart from having Solidifying Spirit Elixirs, there are many other good things.</p><p></p><p>If you are willing to join our Empty Sect, this humble monk can guarantee that I will take good care of you.</p><p></p><p>Your temperament is very Buddhist-like, you are truly suited for cultivating Buddhism."</p><p></p><p>"Stop it, you're at it again. If you keep this up, I'll go join the Taoist Sect next door and become a monk."</p><p></p><p>"Alas!"</p><p></p><p>Fa Zheng sighed deeply.</p><p></p><p>Ever since he first met Ye Xiao, his attachment to him has never faded.</p><p></p><p>Ye Xiao is truly one he has seen who is very suited for cultivating Buddhism, and he is still young. His future accomplishments may not be low.</p><p></p><p>"Since Ye Disciple is not willing now, then I'll wait a bit longer. Wait until Ye Disciple is willing, then we'll talk again."</p><p></p><p>"Then don't wait anymore."</p><p></p><p>The old Buddhist monk neither nodded nor shook his head, but Ye Xiao could see the determination in his eyes - he would not give up.</p><p></p><p>Let him be, Ye Xiao has no intention of becoming a monk anyway. For a young man who pursues coolness, he won't allow his hairstyle to become bald.</p><p></p><p>After finishing the meal, Fa Zheng needed to return to the academy to preside over the affairs of their branch, while Ye Xiao was going back to read books.</p><p></p><p>The books Shaolin just sent over are really too precious to not read.</p><p></p><p>Surprisingly, Shaolin's cultivation techniques are indeed quite good, many of them are not plagiarized.</p><p></p><p>Ye Xiao had just read for half a day, and he had already obtained a basic fist technique and four basic palm techniques.</p><p></p><p>Originally, the number of fist techniques was supposed to be more than the palm techniques, but now the situation has reversed, with the palm techniques surpassing the fist techniques.</p><p></p><p>Moreover, the papers that had the imprint of the palm techniques have already started to faintly emit a golden yellow color, indicating that if he learns another palm technique, they may fuse together.</p><p></p><p>I wonder what kind of palm technique will be formed then.</p><p></p><p>"Duang~!"</p><p></p><p>Time always flies by quickly when reading, and in the blink of an eye, it was time to get off work.</p><p></p><p>Since Ye Xiao had just been assigned to the fourth district, and no new people had been arranged yet, he could only tidy up the books and clean up the place by himself for now.</p><p></p><p>Unwilling to casually use the Divine Will Technique in public, he estimated he would be busy until nightfall.</p><p></p><p>And at this moment, outside the library, under the statue of the Immortal Sword Cultivator, a faint bloodthirsty aura began to emerge.</p>

        <h1>Chapter 276</h1>
        <div class="content">
            <p>Here is the full English translation of the Chinese excerpt:</p><p></p><p>First, it was his cultivation. Originally, he did not even have a cultivation level that exceeded half of the King Realm.</p><p></p><p>But now, he had already broken through to the peak of the King Realm cultivation.</p><p></p><p>Secondly, all the divine blood within his body had been fully activated.</p><p></p><p>This meant that from this moment on, his bloodline had completely surpassed that of ordinary mortals.</p><p></p><p>In fact, even the imperial bloodline of someone like Qin Yuyan, who was blessed by the great fortune of the Nine Realms, and whose divine blood was activated, did not possess blood as pure as his current divine blood.</p><p></p><p>This was the greatest help for Ye Xiao coming here!</p><p></p><p>The enhancement of his bloodline also meant that the potential of his physique could be further developed. From now on, he could go even further. His cultivation speed would become faster. The benefits were countless.</p><p></p><p>If one had to describe this change in a single sentence, it could be said that it had brought about an earth-shattering transformation in Ye Xiao's martial dao path.</p><p></p><p>Apart from this, Ye Xiao's heart techniques had also been completely integrated.</p><p></p><p>The three heart techniques - Purple Cosmos Sea, Dharma Sutra, and Embracing All Rivers - had been fused into a divine heart technique - the Nine Revolving Lotus Sutra!</p><p></p><p>This divine heart technique was extremely powerful, possessing nine transformations. Each transformation would greatly increase the speed of absorbing spiritual energy, and this would be repeated nine times in a cycle without end.</p><p></p><p>Moreover, because there were nine transformations, it could adapt to various changes in spiritual energy, and even convert energy mediums.</p><p></p><p>For example, if Ye Xiao found himself in a place filled with demonic qi, the Nine Revolving Lotus Sutra could transform the demonic qi into spiritual energy.</p><p></p><p>This ensured that Ye Xiao could fight comprehensively in all kinds of environments and have a reliable source of energy for his battles.</p><p></p><p>In this way, Ye Xiao now possessed four divine techniques: Opening the Heavens, Eternal Life Sutra, Yin-Yang Escape Art, and the Nine Revolving Lotus Sutra.</p><p></p><p>Next, he would integrate the martial arts.</p><p></p><p>Ye Xiao had already gathered three martial arts: the Great Extinction Fist, the Enlightened Emperor Fist, and the Thunder Emperor Fist.</p><p></p><p>He would directly initiate the fusion, and it should be completed in less than two days.</p><p></p><p>And at the very moment Ye Xiao's bloodline was fully activated, a rainbow-colored glow was instantly released from the Long White Dragon Vein.</p><p></p><p>This light, imbued with an immense aura of blessings, the moment it shone, caused the snow-covered plants and trees to sprout tender buds.</p><p></p><p>Many martial artists felt an incredibly sacred energy at this moment.</p><p></p><p>Aided by this supremely sacred energy, the cultivation of those within its influence began to surge crazily, like the seven stars aligning to bring a sudden boost to the cultivation of the star beasts.</p><p></p><p>Ye Xiao's divine blood being fully activated and his true divine physique would also change the magnetic field of the earth, bringing a special transformation to the entire Nine Realms.</p><p></p><p>Of course, this change was completely beneficial.</p><p></p><p>The divine light radiated into the sky above and then spread across the Nine Realms.</p><p></p><p>Some martial artists, sensing the profundity within, simply sat down on the ground, crossed their legs, and began to cultivate without a word.</p><p></p><p>Some weak martial artists even broke through their bottlenecks at this moment without even needing to cultivate.</p><p></p><p>At this time, the Nine Realms had truly become an ocean of joy for martial artists!</p><p></p><p>Some who had been trapped in the Acquired Realm their entire lives and could never break through to the Innate Realm were now moved to tears with excitement.</p><p></p><p>"I've broken through! I've broken through to the Innate Realm. Wuwuwu."</p><p></p><p>Elder White Tiger and Beitang Ce exchanged a glance, both seeing the deep confusion and fear in each other's eyes.</p><p></p><p>"What did this guy do inside? How did he create such a huge commotion?"</p><p></p><p>"Elder White Tiger, what is this? Can't even you figure it out with your knowledge?"</p><p></p><p>Elder White Tiger took a deep breath, looking gravely at the rainbow-colored divine light on the Long White Dragon Vein.</p><p></p><p>"To be honest, I really don't know. What does this represent? But one thing I know is that the Nine Realms should not have any trouble with the beast calamity this time.</p><p></p><p>In fact, it can be said that from now on, there will be no more trouble."</p><p></p><p>Beitang Ce's heart trembled, as he knew the implications behind Elder White Tiger's words.</p><p></p><p>He clenched his fists, his gaze fixed intently on the mountain in front of him.</p><p></p><p>This time, bringing Ye Xiao here was truly the right decision!</p><p></p><p>Above the Jianghai City, due to the successive battles, the Dao Immortal Li Shuishui had gradually regained a bit of consciousness.</p><p></p><p>After all, the strength of the Mysterious Turtle Elder was still too great. He was a true King Realm expert, while Li Shuishui had not yet broken through to that final step.</p><p></p><p>Although Jiang Chen's methods were mainly defensive, the King Realm was still the King Realm. Even his ordinary attacks could be on par with Li Shuishui's full-power strikes. Li Shuishui was simply no match for him.</p><p></p><p>Under the suppression of Jiang Chen's powerful techniques, the demonic qi in Li Shuishui had been dispersed to some extent, and his consciousness had also recovered a little.</p><p></p><p>"Elder, I've troubled you."</p><p></p><p>The Mysterious Turtle Elder looked at the Li Shuishui, who had been tormented by the demonic qi to the point of being unrecognizable, with some sympathy.</p><p></p><p>"Shuishui, can you still hold on?"</p><p></p><p>Li Shuishui gave a bitter smile and shook his head slightly.</p><p></p><p>"It's already too late. I'm only able to suppress my body with great effort now. It won't be long before the demonic qi completely devours my last bit of consciousness.</p><p></p><p>Elder, please do it! While I still have a shred of sanity left, give me a merciful end."</p><p></p><p>Here is the full English translation of the Chinese excerpt:</p><p></p><p>"At least, when I die, I can die as a member of the human race. I can preserve the last dignity of being human!"</p><p></p><p>As he said this, Li Liushui looked up at the sky, his eyes filled with a sense of liberation. It is said that after a person dies, their soul will turn into a star in the sky.</p><p></p><p>He didn't know if he could become a star, or where his position would be, or if he could still look down at the Nine Provinces. Master Xuanwu's eyes were pained.</p><p></p><p>He knew that this was the final moment.</p><p></p><p>If there was even a sliver of a chance, Li Liushui would never have let himself do this.</p><p></p><p>No one knew the condition of his body better than him.</p><p></p><p>It's a pity that a powerful expert who had fought for the Nine Provinces for many years was about to die by his own hand.</p><p></p><p>This heartache is difficult to understand if you're not in his shoes.</p><p></p><p>But despite the heartache, he still had to act.</p><p></p><p>Because if he waited for the other party to be possessed by the demonic energy, it would not be so easy to deal with.</p><p></p><p>Perhaps he would choose to flee and hide somewhere, and then endanger the mortal world in the future.</p><p></p><p>That would be the real sin.</p><p></p><p>After taking a deep breath, Jiang Chen began to gather his own power. The cultivation technique was running wildly in his body, channeling all the spiritual energy to his fist.</p><p></p><p>The ultimate strike of a Monarch Realm expert was unleashed at this moment! A thunderous roar shook the heavens, and the wind and clouds scattered in fear.</p><p></p><p>In this moment, there was only this one punch in the world.</p><p></p><p>The punch light completely enveloped Li Liushui without any reservation.</p><p></p><p>But just at the last moment, a auspicious divine light suddenly appeared in the sky.</p><p></p><p>Seeing that divine light, Li Liushui's body suddenly trembled, and all the demonic energy in his body was instantly swept away and transformed into rich spiritual energy.</p><p></p><p>Boom! At the same moment the punch light exploded, his body automatically formed a powerful defensive barrier, blocking Master Xuanwu Jiang Chen's punch.</p><p></p><p>Normally, with his cultivation, he would not have been able to block Jiang Chen's punch as a Monarch Realm expert.</p><p></p><p>But at the moment the barrier was formed, he had actually broken through to the Monarch Realm.</p><p></p><p>Thereafter, endless and majestic spiritual energy gushed out, all pouring into the spiritual energy barrier in front of him.</p><p></p><p>When the light disappeared, the demonic Li Liushui had vanished. In his place was the refined and elegant elder, his aura now inwardly powerful, with not a trace of killing intent.</p><p></p><p>Master Xuanwu sighed with emotion.</p><p></p><p>"Unexpectedly, at the last moment, you were reborn and broke through that layer of limitation! Congratulations!"</p><p></p><p>Li Liushui nodded, now a true Monarch Realm expert.</p><p></p><p>Feeling the thick and powerful strength within himself, he was deeply moved.</p><p></p><p>Is this the power he had been striving for hundreds of years to pursue?</p><p></p><p>It was indeed powerful enough.</p><p></p><p>But it was precisely because he knew how powerful a Monarch Realm expert was now that he couldn't help but marvel at Ye Xiao's strength even more.</p><p></p><p>To be able to break through to this realm at the age of twenty-one, Ye Xiao's existence was a miracle in itself!</p><p></p><p>"That rainbow-colored light just now came from the northeast direction. Could it be...?"</p><p></p><p>Li Liushui tentatively voiced his guess.</p><p></p><p>Jiang Chen nodded.</p><p></p><p>"Apart from him, there shouldn't be a second person capable of doing this. This kid is truly a prodigy, and every time he causes a disturbance, it leaves us speechless."</p><p></p><p>Inside the Long Bai Dragon Vein, after Ye Xiao had reviewed his current situation and began to refine the martial arts, he looked at the sleeping Dragon Vein with a warm heart.</p><p></p><p>He actually knew in his heart that if the Dragon Vein hadn't infused him with more dragon qi at the last moment, he wouldn't have been able to fully activate the divine blood.</p><p></p><p>Although the Dragon Vein elder had said that he could only give him one-tenth of the dragon qi, ensuring that he himself would not be harmed, in the end he still chose to protect Ye Xiao, sacrificing his own dragon qi.</p><p></p><p>This ultimately caused Ye Xiao to fall into a deep slumber.</p><p></p><p>Because of this, Ye Xiao would definitely repay the favor to the elder in the future.</p><p></p><p>Currently, Ye Xiao had not truly broken through to the Emperor Realm, and even if he did, he probably wouldn't be able to do anything to the Dragon Vein.</p><p></p><p>Only after reaching an even stronger realm might he have the chance to restore the Dragon Vein elder's dragon qi.</p><p></p><p>But it doesn't matter, Ye Xiao believes that with his current cultivation speed, it shouldn't take long before he can break through. At that time, he will definitely come back to thank the Dragon Vein elder.</p><p></p><p>After cupping his hands and saluting the Dragon Vein, Ye Xiao turned and left the Dragon Vein, returning to the outside world.</p><p></p><p>Due to the Yin-Yang Escape Art, he no longer needed to climb the Sky Ladder, and could easily break through any formation or natural defense.</p><p></p><p>So he could break through the Dragon Vein's blockade and directly come to the outside of the mountain.</p>

        <h1>Chapter 358</h1>
        <div class="content">
            <p>Here is the full English translation of the Chinese excerpt:</p><p></p><p>That is to say, if I can find another divine-level blade technique, I can use my Golden Book divine soul to synthesize a precious technique? Secondly, there are the Great Perfection divine body, the Indestructible Cloud Cauldron body, and the Eternal Life Technique. </p><p></p><p>These two cultivation techniques and one healing technique, three completely unrelated skills, fused together, and after adding one more healing technique, I should be able to synthesize the second precious technique.</p><p></p><p>This might seem a bit illogical.</p><p></p><p>If Ye Xiao had not reached the divine realm and did not understand divine souls, he might have asked himself involuntarily:</p><p></p><p>Why can four different techniques be combined to form a precious technique?</p><p></p><p>The techniques previously synthesized by the Golden Book divine soul were all about fusing single techniques together to form higher-level techniques.</p><p></p><p>But now the rules have changed, and this constraint has been broken free.</p><p></p><p>After Ye Xiao understood divine souls, he realized the reason.</p><p></p><p>To be precise, all the powers manifested in this world actually have a common origin.</p><p></p><p>This origin has shaped and gradually differentiated, forming the diverse martial arts we see in the vast world today.</p><p></p><p>But in reality, when they are combined, they can shape their own origin.</p><p></p><p>The closer one gets to the origin, the stronger the power manifested.</p><p></p><p>Whether it's blade techniques or sword techniques, their attack methods are actually very similar, even basically the same.</p><p></p><p>So these two martial arts can be fused together, tracing back to the origin to form a precious technique! A precious technique is an existence that surpasses divine techniques, and it must contain more forms of power.</p><p></p><p>Similarly, cultivation techniques and healing techniques, in essence, are also quite similar.</p><p></p><p>The original intention of both is to ensure the immortality of the human body.</p><p></p><p>So there are certain similarities between the two.</p><p></p><p>When these similarities are fused together, they can also form a precious technique.</p><p></p><p>However, this also makes Ye Xiao feel quite good.</p><p></p><p>Thinking carefully, how powerful is a precious technique? It is something that only the top-tier families and ancient monsters who have lived for countless years possess.</p><p></p><p>How could it be easily synthesized with just two divine techniques?</p><p></p><p>Using four or even more divine techniques to synthesize it can truly demonstrate its preciousness.</p><p></p><p>As for the other techniques, they have not yet shown a faint golden light.</p><p></p><p>Ye Xiao roughly guessed that it might be because they have not yet reached the level of two types of divine techniques.</p><p></p><p>If they also reach a state like the sword technique and body technique, they can communicate with a third party and then emit a faint golden light.</p><p></p><p>But as long as there is a path, it's good.</p><p></p><p>With a path, the remaining road will have a direction, and I can walk it better.</p><p></p><p>"Oh, my eye technique seems to be gone, replaced by my activated divine eyes.</p><p></p><p>Before, I was just thinking about breaking through to the divine realm, and I had forgotten about it, never using it. Now it's time to see its power."</p><p></p><p>Ye Xiao took a deep breath and focused his attention on the eye technique.</p><p></p><p>The next moment, his eyes turned into a clear purple color.</p><p></p><p>And his gaze seemed to possess various special functions.</p><p></p><p>Long-distance vision, X-ray vision, analysis, illusion, attack - a series of powerful abilities were manifested in his divine eyes.</p><p></p><p>"Wow, such powerful divine eyes!" </p><p></p><p>Ye Xiao couldn't help but exclaim.</p><p></p><p>He tried to use the Golden Book divine soul to scan these divine eyes, wanting to see what they were.</p><p></p><p>The Golden Book should be able to know its identity, as it had absorbed the eye technique skills recorded before.</p><p></p><p>Soon, the necessary information appeared on the Golden Book.</p><p></p><p>The Ancestor of All Eyes - the Primal Eyes! The Primal Eyes possess the strongest ability to trace the origin.</p><p></p><p>As long as it has seen a divine eye before, it can analyze and trace the origin of the other's eye power, and then form its own mode.</p><p></p><p>That is to say, it can possess all kinds of divine eye powers, the most original part of them.</p><p></p><p>It is a growth-type ability, which will become stronger and stronger with the strengthening of the main body, and will also continuously enhance itself through analysis.</p><p></p><p>Ye Xiao felt this ability was a bit overpowered, but at the same time, it was a bit ridiculous.</p><p></p><p>Isn't this just plagiarism? When he was reading books, he was plagiarizing others, so now should he go plagiarize others? Isn't that like slapping his own face?</p><p></p><p>Although this divine eye has a grand name, its deeds are not so glorious.</p><p></p><p>At this time, another line of small words appeared on the Golden Book.</p><p></p><p>The Ancestor of All Eyes, the Ancestor of Divine Eyes, when reaching the limit, can surpass precious techniques.</p><p></p><p>Ye Xiao: "(_..)!"</p><p></p><p>Forget it, plagiarizing a bit won't make me pregnant or kill anyone.</p><p></p><p>Moreover, this can't really be considered plagiarism.</p><p></p><p>Between divine eyes, can it be called plagiarism?</p><p></p><p>The Primal Eyes are the ancestor of all divine eyes, after all.</p><p></p><p>It's not directly copying the abilities of other divine eyes, it has these abilities inherently.</p><p></p><p>But the problem is, it needs to take a look to analyze the sealed eye techniques deep in its bloodline.</p><p></p><p>"Oh, right, speaking of which, Northern Palace Ce's Ghostly Flame Spiritual Eyes are also a very powerful divine eye. Maybe I should try it first? Perhaps it will give my eyes even more special functions."</p><p></p><p>Thinking this, he immediately put it into action.</p><p></p><p>Here is my translation of the Chinese excerpt:</p><p></p><p>Ye Xiao immediately activated his Yin-Yang Escape technique and arrived in the Central Plains to search for Beitang Ce. </p><p></p><p>At this time, Beitang Ce was fully armed, as if he was about to go on a long journey.</p><p></p><p>"Ah, Ye Xiao, why did you suddenly appear?" </p><p></p><p>"I've come to find you about something. By the way, what's going on with you?"</p><p></p><p>Beitang Ce looked at his own clothes and smiled.</p><p></p><p>"Right now, there is a severe shortage of people for the Star Sky Divine Tomb expedition, and I've also signed up. I'm about to go participate in the tomb excavation. </p><p></p><p>I've heard that many good things can be obtained. Do you want to go with me? </p><p></p><p>With your strength, you might be able to dig up a lot of good stuff."</p><p></p><p>Ye Xiao shook his head. </p><p></p><p>Those were just divine-level tombs, and they wouldn't provide much improvement for him. Going there would just be a waste of time.</p><p></p><p>Furthermore, he had a true grand goal in his heart - the Divine Nation's Treasure Vault!</p><p></p><p>If he was going to eat, he might as well go for the biggest, rather than messing around with all these minor things. What's the use?</p><p></p><p>Not to mention taking a hundred, or even a thousand or ten thousand of those tombs - would that really elevate him to the level of a Godslayer expert? </p><p></p><p>If that were possible, then they wouldn't have died in the first place.</p><p></p><p>"I won't go. I have other matters to attend to.</p><p></p><p>I now want to ask Senior Beitang a favor."</p><p></p><p>Beitang Ce chuckled.</p><p></p><p>"Go ahead. You've come from so far away, what is it you want to do?"</p><p></p><p>"I want to take a look at your Ghost Fire Spiritual Eyes."</p><p></p><p>"Just that?"</p><p></p><p>Beitang Ce was puzzled.</p><p></p><p>"You came all this way just for this small matter?"</p><p></p><p>Ye Xiao nodded.</p><p></p><p>"Hurry up! I'm in a rush."</p><p></p><p>"Alright!"</p><p></p><p>Beitang Ce immediately activated his Ghost Fire Spiritual Eyes for Ye Xiao to see. Ye Xiao only looked for a moment, and in the next second, his Primal Eyes had recorded the technique and activated the corresponding abilities within them.</p><p></p><p>One was an attack, and the other was the ability to see through the essence of all things.</p><p></p><p>This was the nature of the Ghost Fire Spiritual Eyes.</p><p></p><p>In the past, it was because Beitang Ce had the Ghost Fire Spiritual Eyes that Ye Xiao's identity was exposed, and he was seen through at a glance.</p><p></p><p>It had to be said that in this regard, the Ghost Fire Spiritual Eyes were truly formidable.</p><p></p><p>After obtaining this ability, Ye Xiao waved his hand.</p><p></p><p>"Thank you, I've recorded this favor. I'll repay you for it in the future."</p><p></p><p>With that, Ye Xiao activated the Yin-Yang Escape technique again and instantly disappeared from the scene, leaving a bewildered Beitang Ce behind.</p><p></p><p>"Strange, what is this kid up to? Why did he suddenly come over and make such a strange request?"</p><p></p><p>Just to take a look at his divine eyes, and then quickly leave. </p><p></p><p>What was he plotting?</p><p></p><p>But after thinking about it for a while, he couldn't figure it out, and could only give up, as the time to gather for the Star Sky expedition had arrived, and he had to go.</p><p></p><p>On Ye Xiao's side, after obtaining the ability of the Ghost Fire Spiritual Eyes, he immediately began to activate his Primal Eyes and flew up into the air to scan the entire Nine Provinces.</p><p></p><p>The Heavenly Profound Celestial Art, a supreme-level spiritual technique, could not locate the position of the Kunlun Dragon Vein. Now, with the Primal Eyes, he should be able to find it, right?</p><p></p><p>Sure enough, Ye Xiao quickly discovered and locked onto a location. His heart couldn't help but suddenly beat rapidly - he had finally found it! The Yin-Yang Escape technique was activated again, and he instantly arrived at the spot.</p><p></p><p>As soon as he arrived, he felt an extremely powerful spiritual energy force. </p><p></p><p>The spiritual energy here had completely condensed into substance! </p><p></p><p>In other words, the spiritual energy here was so dense that it had already cultivated spiritual stones, no, even divine crystals! Ye Xiao took a deep breath and activated his Primal Eyes again, carefully scanning the area. The next moment, his gaze revealed a massive underground vein of mineral deposits.</p><p></p><p>"So huge!"</p><p></p><p>Ye Xiao couldn't help but exclaim in surprise.</p><p></p><p>It was truly too massive, too enormous.</p><p></p><p>He never imagined that the Kunlun Dragon Vein could span across the entire Nine Provinces! It was just that its power was so great that ordinary people could not easily perceive it.</p><p></p><p>Even his previous use of spiritual power, perception, and spiritual energy had failed to locate it.</p><p></p><p>Because in addition to its immense strength, it had another extremely prominent characteristic.</p><p></p><p>That was, it was composed of pure spiritual energy.</p><p></p><p>In other words, it had no impurities, just like the air. </p><p></p><p>Who could discern if there was anything different in the air?</p><p></p><p>This was also the reason why Ye Xiao had been shielded from it before.</p><p></p><p>But now, after seeing the Ghost Fire Spiritual Eyes, his Primal Eyes had gained the ability to penetrate the essence of all things. Combined with the fact that it was the Primal Eyes, when he activated this ability, it was probably many times stronger than Beitang Ce's Ghost Fire Spiritual Eyes.</p><p></p><p>Beitang Ce's eye technique was probably only at the Celestial Realm level.</p><p></p><p>But Ye Xiao's Primal Eyes had already surpassed the Divine Realm, although it had not yet truly reached the level of the Primordial Treasure Art, it was not far off.</p>

        <h1>Chapter 417</h1>
        <div class="content">
            <p>Here is the full English translation of the Chinese excerpt:</p><p></p><p>After all, the Golden Book is, strictly speaking, just a spiritual entity.</p><p></p><p>Other people also have spiritual entities!</p><p></p><p>What everyone has is not something unique, so how could this be the legendary Golden Finger? The Golden Finger must be thick and round, smooth and shiny, and glittering.</p><p></p><p>The kind that can draw water with just a glance! After many experiences and thoughts, Ye Xiao has finally figured it out.</p><p></p><p>His Golden Finger is most likely his own moral character!</p><p></p><p>Because he is upright and kind, honest and trustworthy, with an exceptionally high moral character, his luck value is very good.</p><p></p><p>Based on this, he has been able to steadily advance to where he is today.</p><p></p><p>What is he lacking? Heaven will provide him with it. What does he want? It will arrive within three days.</p><p></p><p>It's as if this world is serving him in the unseen.</p><p></p><p>It seems that he must uphold his moral character in the future.</p><p></p><p>Thinking of this, he walked towards the other two people.</p><p></p><p>Thunder King and Shifang King swept their eyes around the surroundings.</p><p></p><p>"There are so many people here. Whom should we ask? Or should we just randomly grab someone and forcibly search their memories with spiritual power?"</p><p></p><p>"We can't act rashly. There are also Deicide Realm experts in this city. If we anger them too much, it may bring us some trouble.</p><p></p><p>The two of us have just been revived, and our strength has not fully recovered to the God King Realm, we are only at the Deicide Realm Fifth Layer.</p><p></p><p>We should be low-key, if we are too high-profile, it may end up with someone dying."</p><p></p><p>"Shifang brother is right, I was too hasty. The world has changed, the two of us are no longer the God Kings of the past, now we are only at the Deicide Realm Fifth Layer, we should be more low-key in our actions."</p><p></p><p>As he spoke, his gaze fell on Ye Xiao who had just walked over.</p><p></p><p>"Young man, the two of us are new here and are looking for something, but we don't know where to find it. Could you please help us?"</p><p></p><p>As he spoke, he took out a divine crystal from his pocket.</p><p></p><p>Ye Xiao nodded.</p><p></p><p>"It's a small matter, no need for a reward. Elders, please go ahead and ask."</p><p></p><p>Thunder King also smiled slightly, not bad, this young man is very nice, not only is he handsome and good-looking, but he is also very considerate.</p><p></p><p>"Then I'd like to ask, do you know that the Xuanyuan Clan has recently dug out many coffins from the God King's Tomb?"</p><p></p><p>"Of course I know, everyone in the Jianghai City knows about it."</p><p></p><p>Thunder King's smile grew wider, feeling that looking at Ye Xiao was even more pleasing.</p><p></p><p>What a sincere and honest child!</p><p></p><p>Unexpectedly, the younger generation these days are all so simple and honest, and he is also very good-looking, even a man like himself thinks he is very handsome.</p><p></p><p>This child's character is not bad, and although his talent cannot be seen, it should not be too bad either.</p><p></p><p>Perhaps he can consider taking this child as a disciple, to serve him and attend to his needs.</p><p></p><p>"Good! If you can lead us to those coffins, I will greatly reward you, old man."</p><p></p><p>"Elders are too polite."</p><p></p><p>With that, Ye Xiao started walking forward, and Thunder King and Shifang King immediately followed.</p><p></p><p>"Shifang, this kid is not bad, I have the heart to take him as a disciple to serve me, what do you think?"</p><p></p><p>Shifang King chuckled.</p><p></p><p>"Nothing simpler? With our status, taking him as a disciple would be a blessing that he could not even dream of in eight lifetimes."</p><p></p><p>"Okay, after we find Alfa and Flame Dragon later, I'll take this kid away and use him."</p><p></p><p>Shifang King nodded.</p><p></p><p>The two followed Ye Xiao and soon arrived at the outskirts, in front of Ye Xiao's small courtyard.</p><p></p><p>"It's inside here."</p><p></p><p>"Here?"</p><p></p><p>The two of them couldn't help but raise their eyebrows, somewhat puzzled.</p><p></p><p>Ye Xiao spoke again:</p><p></p><p>"The Ning family people couldn't break the seal on the black coffin, so they buried them here and sealed them with a formation."</p><p></p><p>"I see."</p><p></p><p>The two of them nodded.</p><p></p><p>What Ye Xiao said was reasonable and had no major loopholes.</p><p></p><p>The formations on that black coffin were all set up by high-level formation masters of the Ancient Divine Nation.</p><p></p><p>Given the level of the people the Xuanyuan Clan had arranged here, they would not be able to break the formations, so burying and sealing them in a place was very normal.</p><p></p><p>"Let me take a look at this formation."</p><p></p><p>Shifang King stepped forward, and Ye Xiao had already turned off the real formation, leaving only a very shoddy one.</p><p></p><p>After all, the Beasts Sovereign below had already been completely tamed, there was no need to worry about them escaping.</p><p></p><p>Shifang King took a glance and couldn't help but shake his head and chuckle.</p><p></p><p>"Has the craftsmanship of formations in the later generations really degraded to this level? This level of formation, to be honest, is not even as good as the subordinates I used to teach."</p><p></p><p>Thunder King laughed heartily, "How could they be comparable to you? They are not even qualified to carry your shoes. Alright, don't waste any more time, quickly break this formation and release Alfa and the others."</p><p></p><p>"Okay!"</p><p></p><p>Shifang King easily opened the formation, then leaped in, and Thunder King followed closely behind. The Beasts Sovereign who were resting were suddenly awakened by their intrusion.</p><p></p><p>Here is my translation of the Chinese excerpt:</p><p></p><p>When they saw the Ten Directions King and the Thunder King, their eyes couldn't help but flash with a murderous light. </p><p></p><p>That was the bloodthirsty gleam inherent in the Star Beasts.</p><p></p><p>"Another big meal has come to us."</p><p></p><p>"Brothers, attack!"</p><p></p><p>Just as the Beast Lords were about to move forward, the Thunder King didn't even glance at them, merely snorting lightly.</p><p></p><p>In that instant, a terrifying thunderous force suddenly crashed into the Star Beasts.</p><p></p><p>Boom! Accompanied by an earth-shattering explosion, these Star Beasts were instantly blasted back into the walls, grievously wounded.</p><p></p><p>"A bunch of trash, daring to attack my royal self, seeking death!" </p><p></p><p>The Thunder King couldn't help but mock, while the Ten Directions King spoke indifferently:</p><p></p><p>"These should be the Xuanyuan Clan, sent to guard Alpha and the Flame Dragon. No need to pay them much mind, we'll just refine them into elixir later.</p><p></p><p>But why is there only one coffin here, and it's already been opened?"</p><p></p><p>"Indeed, this black coffin seems to be the Flame Dragon's, but where is the Flame Dragon?"</p><p></p><p>"Because...he is dead!"</p><p></p><p>At this moment, Ye Xiao's voice slowly came from behind them.</p><p></p><p>Accompanying the voice was an extremely sharp sword qi.</p><p></p><p>Thunder King: "?!?!"</p><p>Ten Directions King: "?!?!"</p><p></p><p>The two of them didn't even have time to react before their heads rolled off, announcing their demise. </p><p></p><p>Up until their dying moments, they never understood what had happened.</p><p></p><p>They were discovered? </p><p></p><p>When were they discovered? The one leading them here was just an extremely simple-looking youth, right? What the hell is going on?</p><p></p><p>In the final moments before their spiritual souls shattered, they still couldn't figure out what had happened.</p><p></p><p>As for the other Beast Lords, they limped towards Ye Xiao.</p><p></p><p>"Master, who were those two?"</p><p></p><p>"Two Primordial God Kings."</p><p></p><p>The Star Beasts couldn't help but shudder. </p><p></p><p>Good heavens, they were actually two Primordial God Kings! No wonder they were so powerful!</p><p></p><p>And judging by the current situation, it seems the two of them hadn't fully recovered from their injuries yet, otherwise the Thunder King's casual snort just now would have been enough to instantly kill them.</p><p></p><p>But even so, the two of them were still terrifyingly powerful! The most formidable one, however, was Ye Xiao.</p><p></p><p>To actually lure these two just-revived Primordial God Kings in and then instantly kill them. </p><p></p><p>He was the true terror!</p><p></p><p>Ye Xiao casually waved his hand, activating the Immortal Treasure Art, instantly healing all the Star Beasts' injuries.</p><p></p><p>"You all wait in the corner."</p><p></p><p>"Yes!"</p><p></p><p>The Star Beasts immediately retreated to the wall corner, while Ye Xiao began to extract and absorb the divine blood of the Thunder King and Ten Directions King, refining it.</p><p></p><p>At the same time, in the starry sky, Su Chen, who had been cultivating, suddenly opened his eyes, a cold glint flashing in his gaze.</p><p></p><p>"What's going on? The Thunder King and Ten Directions King fell so quickly? Their cultivation, while far from their peak, was still at the Deicide Realm Fifth Layer, a level of existence that can dominate the human world.</p><p></p><p>What kind of super expert did they run into? Could it be...the Sword Immortal?"</p><p></p><p>But soon, Su Chen shook his head.</p><p></p><p>It shouldn't be possible, the Sword Immortal, even in the era before the Deity Clan's arrival, might have had some strength, but now, with the gathering of various powerful experts, he was just a insignificant trash in the Canglan Star Realm.</p><p></p><p>The reason Su Chen could rise so quickly was that he had obtained his master's inheritance, the Blood Sutra that defied the heavens, an amazing cultivation method that could even be promoted to the level of Primordial Treasure Art! And he had also been secretly absorbing large amounts of divine blood.</p><p></p><p>Does the Sword Immortal have such opportunities? Is he worthy? Now, he's not even qualified to carry Su Chen's shoes, if it weren't for the Xuanyuan Clan on the ground, Su Chen would have already gone to Jianghai City to annihilate that Sword Immortal.</p><p></p><p>So, it couldn't possibly be the Sword Immortal.</p><p></p><p>"Could it be...a hidden expert sent by the Ning Family?"</p><p></p><p>Su Chen nodded, confirming this answer.</p><p></p><p>It must be because of this reason.</p><p></p><p>Currently, only the Ning Family has the ability to find an expert surpassing the Deicide Realm Fifth Layer.</p><p></p><p>"Damn the Ning Family, disrupting my plans, when I become a Divine Emperor in the future, the one hundred and twenty-seventh existence to be annihilated will be your Ning Family!"</p><p></p><p>However, despite saying that, he still needed to figure out how to raise his own strength.</p><p></p><p>But how can he create chaos and make the Deity Clans destroy each other? And the current Deity Clans outside are too weak, the effect won't be good. If he could bring in some stronger existences...</p><p></p><p>Just as he had this thought, a powerful aura suddenly erupted in the outer star realms.</p><p></p><p>"This is...?"</p><p></p><p>It's the experts from the Hundred Clan Alliance, they've all come out since the Divine Emperor's Tomb has appeared!</p><p></p><p>Su Chen's eyes lit up, and then the corners of his mouth curved upwards.</p><p></p><p>It seems he can absorb even more divine blood in the future!</p>

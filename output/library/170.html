        <h1>Chapter 170</h1>
        <div class="content">
            <p>Here is the full English translation of the Chinese excerpt:</p><p></p><p>With this, since the attacks were different, it could lead to the opponent's defense being flawed, and thus the chance of failure would be slightly lower.</p><p></p><p>When Kamui Hitoshi saw so many arrogant sword auras, he was completely dumbfounded.</p><p></p><p>"Damn it!"</p><p></p><p>As a powerful cultivator of the Divine Sect, he couldn't help but blurt out a curse word at this moment. He had originally just wanted to use a feint technique and then turn around and run, but he didn't expect Ye Xiao to be so brutal.</p><p></p><p>No, "brutal" is not enough to describe this - it's simply insane! Is it necessary?</p><p></p><p>It's just a friendly sparring match, is it necessary to make such a big show of it?</p><p></p><p>At this moment, Kamui Hitoshi regretted it, thoroughly regretted it.</p><p></p><p>He shouldn't have come to Kyushu.</p><p></p><p>Now it's too late to resist, and even if he resists, what can he use to resist?</p><p></p><p>The techniques of the Iga Ninja Sword are mostly assassination-oriented, and in terms of sword skills, they lean more towards the mysterious and eerie type, emphasizing the element of surprise in combat, with limited ability to display their full strength in a direct confrontation.</p><p></p><p>Not to mention facing Ye Xiao's tyrannical sword techniques, which are so powerful, domineering and unstoppable.</p><p></p><p>The moment the tyrannical sword auras appeared, Kamui Hitoshi's twenty-four sword auras were instantly shattered like glass, and the remaining sword auras were all enveloped around him.</p><p></p><p>Boom, boom, boom...</p><p></p><p>Amid the violent explosions, Kamui Hitoshi turned into light!</p><p></p><p>All the spectators were stunned into speechlessness at this moment!</p><p></p><p>The exploding flames in the sky were so beautiful, filled with a sense of natural beauty, like the power of lightning, gale, and blizzard - wild, unreasonable, and awe-inspiring, evoking a sense of reverence.</p><p></p><p>This is not an explosion?</p><p></p><p>This is art!</p><p></p><p>As the flames subsided, Kamui Hitoshi's figure gradually emerged.</p><p></p><p>Miserable!</p><p>Tragic!</p><p>Desolate!</p><p></p><p>The onlookers couldn't think of more words, only using these three to roughly describe the scene.</p><p></p><p>Kamui Hitoshi had lost one arm and one leg, and the remaining hand on his arm was also gone. His clothes were mostly destroyed, his skin charred black like charcoal, his whole body trembling uncontrollably, with all his wounds dripping blood. If it weren't for his Divine Sect-level vitality, he would have fainted by now, rather than clinging to life as he was. No one spoke, for this shock was beyond the power of language to express.</p><p></p><p>That was a profound impact on the soul.</p><p></p><p>After all, Divine Sect cultivators were practically god-like existences to these people.</p><p></p><p>And now, the Sword Immortal had pinned two, no, two Divine Sect cultivators to the ground and rubbed them back and forth! This made the onlookers think of a certain song.</p><p></p><p>Rubbing, rubbing, rubbing on the glorious ground...</p><p></p><p>Too awesome!</p><p>Too incredible!</p><p>Too powerful!</p><p></p><p>With the battle over, the electronic devices had resumed normal operation.</p><p></p><p>Seeing this scene, countless netizens couldn't help but exclaim in shock.</p><p></p><p>"My god, is it really that brutal? That's a Divine Sect cultivator! A Divine Sect cultivator, actually beaten so badly? I must be dreaming, right?"</p><p></p><p>"Be more confident, you're not dreaming."</p><p></p><p>"The Sword Immortal, YYDS (the best)!"</p><p></p><p>The confrontation was over, but the legend of the Sword Immortal had not yet ended.</p><p></p><p>All kinds of online forums, WeChat groups, and friend circles were discussing the Sword Immortal.</p><p></p><p>The discussion heat was at the top of the rankings.</p><p></p><p>At this moment, the Sword Immortal had truly stepped out of Jianghai City, shaking Kyushu! </p><p></p><p>It could even be said that he had shaken the world, becoming a god in a single battle! But still, no one knew who he really was.</p><p></p><p>And at this moment, Lu Wanwan and the baby had finally been wheeled out of the operating room.</p><p></p><p>The family members who had been waiting at the operating room door for several hours, Gu Hai and the others, rushed over, some looking at Lu Wanwan, some looking at the baby.</p><p></p><p>Although the responsibilities had been clearly divided earlier, when it came to this moment, they started to get flustered again.</p><p></p><p>The Lu couple definitely wanted to see their daughter, and Gu's parents definitely wanted to see the grandchild first. As for Gu Hai, he wanted to see both his wife and child.</p><p></p><p>Only Ye Xiao stood behind, watching this joyful family scene with a touch of envy.</p><p></p><p>"Doctor, is it a boy or a girl?" </p><p></p><p>Everyone couldn't help but ask curiously, and the doctor smiled and replied:</p><p></p><p>"It's a little princess, seven pounds and eight ounces, perfectly healthy."</p><p></p><p>Lu Wanwan felt a little apologetic and weakly spoke:</p><p></p><p>"Husband, I'm sorry."</p><p></p><p>She knew Gu Hai was not the type to favor sons over daughters, but he had always wanted a son to take him to play soccer, ride motorcycles, and practice martial arts.</p><p></p><p>Gu Hai tightly grasped her hand, his eyes a little moist.</p><p></p><p>"Silly girl, what nonsense are you talking? This is the best gift you've given me with your life, whether it's a boy or a girl, they are all the most precious to me."</p><p></p><p>Life is always in a constant state of growth, and Gu Hai now was no longer the naive young man who only knew how to make mistakes.</p><p></p><p>It's just that Ye Xiao, watching this scene, couldn't quite feel the same resonance.</p><p></p><p>The corner of his eye was a little itchy, and he reached up to touch it, finding it a little damp.</p><p></p><p>It wasn't because of others, but just a bit of melancholy for himself.</p><p></p><p>He had become stronger, distanced himself from the mortal cycle of life and death.</p><p></p><p>But he also seemed to have become less human, with a sense of transcendence over the mundane world.</p><p></p><p>This feeling was like the people in front of him had gradually become ants, and even if he wanted to integrate with them, he could no longer do so.</p><p></p><p>Here is the full English translation of the Chinese excerpt:</p><p></p><p>Your every thought, word, and action, every stillness and movement - all that you are, are things they can only dream of but never truly attain! How can you integrate yourself among them?</p><p></p><p>This is also why he had previously wanted to live an ordinary person's life, because as his abilities grew, sooner or later he would drift away from this world. </p><p></p><p>By the time that happened, if he still wanted to experience human life, it would only be through memories.</p><p></p><p>"Waaah!"</p><p></p><p>At this moment, the baby suddenly let out a loud, distressed cry. Gu Hai quickly took his daughter from her mother's arms.</p><p></p><p>"Mom, let me handle this. I've watched some baby care tutorials before. Newborns are still getting used to their surroundings, so they can be picky. But I'm her real father, she definitely won't be picky with me."</p><p></p><p>"Waaah!"</p><p></p><p>Everyone fell silent for a moment, and Gu Hai looked embarrassed.</p><p></p><p>He then cleared his throat.</p><p></p><p>"Cough cough cough, maybe she just hasn't gotten used to it yet."</p><p></p><p>But as the baby was passed around, she continued to cry.</p><p></p><p>"Is she maybe hungry?" </p><p></p><p>Gu's mother couldn't help but wonder.</p><p></p><p>"Possibly."</p><p></p><p>"Let's first take Wan Wan back to the ward. She just gave birth, she can't be out in the drafty hallway. I'll go find a lactation consultant later."</p><p></p><p>Everyone quickly escorted Lu Wanwan and the baby back to the ward.</p><p></p><p>But the child was still crying.</p><p></p><p>"What should we do? Should we give her some sugar water? I just asked the doctor, and he said we can give her a little sugar water first."</p><p></p><p>Everyone scrambled to prepare the sugar water, but the baby continued to cry.</p><p></p><p>Ye Xiao used his Taixuan Tiangong to scan her, and found that the baby was fine, but her soul was trembling, likely from being frightened by her mother's previous injury.</p><p></p><p>"Let me try."</p><p></p><p>He asked, "Do you think I can soothe the baby?"</p><p></p><p>Gu's mother was a bit doubtful, but Ye Xiao nodded.</p><p></p><p>"I've read about it in books, although I've never actually done it before, so I'll be careful."</p><p></p><p>"Okay, give it a try then."</p><p></p><p>Gu's mother placed the baby in Ye Xiao's arms. Ye Xiao used the soothing power of his Butianshu technique, combined with the calming spiritual energy of his Taixuan Tiangong, and in the blink of an eye, the baby had quieted down.</p><p></p><p>"Haha..."</p><p></p><p>Even more astonishingly, the baby let out two soft giggles, and then drifted off to sleep.</p><p></p><p>In that moment, everyone was greatly amazed.</p><p></p><p>"Whoa! Old Ye, could it be that your charming aura that captivates countless young ladies is also effective on this newborn baby?"</p><p></p><p>Ye Xiao was a bit embarrassed.</p><p></p><p>"Shut up! It's probably because I was just holding some flowers, so I have a floral scent on me. The books say that fragrant flowers can soothe the soul and calm the mind."</p><p></p><p>"Oh really? Next time I'll dab on some flower scent too, see if I can get the same effect."</p><p></p><p>"By the way, since you're the baby's godfather, why don't you come up with a name for her as a backup? We can all discuss it later and use whichever one is best."</p><p></p><p>"Nah, I'm terrible at naming things."</p><p></p><p>Ye Xiao was quite self-aware when it came to naming. As soon as Gu Hai said that, a few names had popped into his mind - Xiaohong, Xiaolan, Guifen, Guihua. But he was afraid if he said them out loud, he'd get hit.</p><p></p><p>So he simply stayed quiet.</p><p></p><p>After a short while, Ye Xiao politely declined Gu Hai's invitation to join them for a meal. This was a family reunion moment, and it wouldn't be appropriate for an outsider like him to participate.</p><p></p><p>He left a red envelope for the baby as a small gesture, then made an excuse about still having work to do and took his leave.</p><p></p><p>In truth, Ye Xiao did have work to attend to. Even though he officially started his new job tomorrow, today he needed to sort out his livestock farming plans.</p><p></p><p>His cultivation was becoming increasingly difficult to break through. Ye Xiao could clearly feel that the power required to advance from Xiantian Eighth Rank to Xiantian Ninth Rank was over ten times more than what was needed to reach Xiantian Eighth Rank.</p><p></p><p>This required a massive amount of spiritual energy. </p><p></p><p>So reviving and farming these star beasts, using their flesh daily to boost his spiritual energy, was crucial for his cultivation.</p><p></p><p>But where should he build the farming facility? After all, these were Shenzong-level star beasts, not just a few chickens that could be kept in a simple cage.</p>

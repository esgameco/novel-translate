        <h1>Chapter 273</h1>
        <div class="content">
            <p>Here is the full English translation of the Chinese excerpt:</p><p></p><p>Atop the Great White Dragon Vein was a massive pool, crystal clear and reflecting the countless stars in the sky. The surface of the water was like a mirror, separating two worlds.</p><p></p><p>Ye Xiao could vaguely see a massive figure slowly swimming in the pool.</p><p></p><p>Because it was so enormous, Ye Xiao could not see its full form from here.</p><p></p><p>Without much hesitation, Ye Xiao took a deep breath and leapt down.</p><p></p><p>The next moment, he felt like he was plunging into a bottomless abyss.</p><p></p><p>The surrounding scenery kept rapidly retreating until Ye Xiao found himself in a vast and dry underground cave.</p><p></p><p>This place was filled with dense spiritual energy. The spiritual energy was so concentrated that the surrounding stone walls had been jade-ified, turning into highly spiritually-dense spirit stones.</p><p></p><p>The cultivation techniques within Ye Xiao's body were constantly operating, and the immense suction force was slowly but visibly raising his cultivation level.</p><p></p><p>Soon, a golden aged figure slowly appeared before Ye Xiao.</p><p></p><p>"After thousands of years, I never expected the human race to produce an existence like you. This truly surprises this old one."</p><p></p><p>Ye Xiao knew that this figure was the dragon shadow he had seen swimming in the pool below - the consciousness of this dragon vein.</p><p></p><p>"Junior Ye Xiao pays respects to the senior."</p><p></p><p>"No need for formalities. For one so young to have broken through to the King Realm and activated your divine blood to this extent is truly rare. Even among the God Clan, you could be considered a prodigy of this era!"</p><p></p><p>Ye Xiao was somewhat surprised, not expecting this dragon vein to know about divine blood and the God Clan.</p><p></p><p>Sensing his thoughts, the dragon vein spoke calmly:</p><p></p><p>"Although I am a being born from the heavens and earth, formed from the gathering of spiritual energy, due to my extremely long lifespan, I do know some things about the starry skies."</p><p></p><p>Ye Xiao couldn't help but ask:</p><p></p><p>"Then senior, what is the relationship between the human race and the God Clan? Is the human race truly the descendants of the God Clan?"</p><p></p><p>The dragon vein incarnation nodded.</p><p></p><p>"Of course, otherwise how do you think the human race came to be?"</p><p></p><p>"But the legends of some gods creating the heavens and earth, and molding humans from clay - are those true or false?"</p><p></p><p>"Naturally, they are false. The heavens and earth are so vast, who could possibly create them? Molding humans from clay is merely a divine technique, how could that possibly create a race as spiritually endowed and endlessly multiplying as humanity?"</p><p></p><p>Ye Xiao breathed a sigh of relief.</p><p></p><p>He had always been worried about this issue. In both his past and present lives, there were many fictional mythological stories, and most of them were interconnected. And the powers of those gods were extremely strong! It was commonly said that there were gods even three feet above one's head. If this world truly had such mythological figures as Pangu, NÃ¼wa, and sages, Ye Xiao would be cursing.</p><p></p><p>With their divine abilities, they could probably sense him with just a thought. No matter how strong his cultivation became, as long as he posed a threat to them, he could be instantly annihilated.</p><p></p><p>Now knowing that this world did not have those abnormal mythological gods, Ye Xiao naturally felt much more at ease.</p><p></p><p>"Then what kind of existence is the God Clan?"</p><p></p><p>"The so-called God Clan is actually just one of the many races in the universe. Or you could say, they are the ultimate refinement and shedding of the human body's genes through the cultivation of heaven and earth's spiritual energy. </p><p></p><p>Since the birth of the universe, countless powerful races have emerged. </p><p></p><p>But regardless of which race, they can all cultivate using the spiritual energy of heaven and earth. The only difference is that their cultivation limits are related to their bloodline.</p><p></p><p>It's like materials - no matter how inferior the material, it can never be forged into a divine weapon.</p><p></p><p>The God Clan has broken through the bloodline limitations of the ordinary human race, reaching an even higher level of existence. Their cultivation speed far surpasses that of the human race.</p><p></p><p>And within the God Clan, there are also many different factions.</p><p></p><p>Thousands of years ago, a God Clan faction called Xuanyuan came to this world, establishing a sacred land and multiplying, gradually forming the current Nine Provinces and the human race that lives upon them.</p><p></p><p>This is also why the star beasts in the starry skies wish to occupy and devour the human race. </p><p></p><p>The reason is that the human body contains diluted divine blood.</p><p></p><p>If they can obtain this divine blood, it would greatly accelerate their own cultivation, even helping them break through the limitations of their current bloodline and become even more powerful."</p><p></p><p>"I see, thank you senior for the guidance!"</p><p></p><p>The dragon vein incarnation nodded.</p><p></p><p>"You have passed my test. I will use my own dragon qi to refine your body and activate the divine blood within you, allowing you to truly become a member of the God Clan. This way, you will be able to walk an even greater path in the future. I also hope you can protect the Nine Provinces."</p><p></p><p>"Thank you, senior."</p><p></p><p>"No need to thank me. If the Nine Provinces are destroyed, those savage star beasts won't leave me, the dragon vein, alone either. They will surely dig me out. So helping you is also helping myself.</p><p></p><p>However, I can only release one-tenth of my dragon qi, as I am now the last dragon vein of the Nine Provinces. I cannot exhaust it all."</p><p></p><p>Here is the full English translation of the Chinese excerpt:</p><p></p><p>The power is all yours. Otherwise, after the Nine Realms, you will never be able to find the Dragon Vein again! Therefore, how much I can help you activate it depends entirely on your own destiny." <div class="contentadv"><script>loadAdv(7,3);</script></div>Ye Xiao thanked him again, and in the next moment, an extremely mighty dragon qi surged into his body.</p><p></p><p>This dragon qi was many times stronger than the artificial dragon vein qi he had obtained before.</p><p></p><p>If the previous dragon qi was as thick as a single hair, this dragon qi was as thick as over a dozen hairs.</p><p></p><p>More than ten times thicker? As this dragon qi rushed into Ye Xiao's body, his blood qi immediately began to boil rapidly. And it was visibly circulating crazily within his body.</p><p></p><p>In that instant, fiery red blood vessels began to appear on Ye Xiao's body surface, and the fresh blood within them was glowing and heating up like molten lava due to the rapid flow.</p><p></p><p>At the same time, combined with the spiritual power in the dragon vein, Ye Xiao's cultivation was rising continuously.</p><p></p><p>He was like a huge vortex, frantically devouring the spiritual power in the dragon vein.</p><p></p><p>Moreover, because of this dragon qi, Ye Xiao's Golden Book divine soul even began to accelerate. The body technique that was already almost complete was now fully synthesized in the blink of an eye under the acceleration of the dragon qi.</p><p></p><p>Divine Movement Art - Yin-Yang Escape Technique! A divine-level body technique.</p><p></p><p>The power of this body technique was not just a simple increase in speed. It even had some unique effects.</p><p></p><p>For example, it could directly penetrate formations.</p><p></p><p>With the Yin-Yang Escape Technique, one could enter a formation without needing to break it open.</p><p></p><p>Of course, it could also break through various elements like stone walls, soil, water, and fire.</p><p></p><p>It was like perfectly combining speed and the Earth Escape Technique, but it had evolved beyond just the Earth Escape Technique, developing a special traversal ability.</p><p></p><p>After the synthesis, it was time to cultivate it. Ye Xiao simply handed it over to his Golden Book divine soul.</p><p></p><p>He estimated that the transformation of his body by the dragon qi would not be easily completed in a short time, so he took the opportunity to synthesize a heart technique.</p><p></p><p>Recently, Ye Xiao had just extracted the third heart technique from the techniques in the library - Embracing All Rivers. Combined with his current Violet Heavenly Sea and Dharma Sutra, he could perfectly synthesize it.</p><p></p><p>And it would be an accelerated synthesis.</p><p></p><p>After the synthesis, he would possess four divine-level techniques:</p><p>Sword Deity Technique - Opening Heaven Sword Art!</p><p>Healing Deity Technique - Eternal Life Sutra!</p><p>Divine Movement Art - Yin-Yang Escape Technique!</p><p>And a heart technique, the nature of which he was still uncertain, but he hoped it wouldn't be too disappointing.</p><p></p><p>He also had fist techniques, having already combined three imperial arts: Great Nirvana Fist, Thunder Emperor Fist, and Emptiness Emperor Fist! As long as he could synthesize the heart technique, he would be able to further combine all the techniques.</p><p></p><p>Then he would possess five divine-level techniques.</p><p></p><p>Perfect!</p><p></p><p>After clicking to synthesize the heart technique, Ye Xiao entered a state of slumber.</p><p></p><p>Next, he just had to wait for the dragon qi to refine the divine blood within his body and activate it.</p><p></p><p>This was a long process, and Ye Xiao could not rush it.</p><p></p><p>As for the dragon soul incarnation, after seeing the golden light emanating from Ye Xiao, it couldn't help but raise its brow slightly.</p><p></p><p>"This kid seems a bit strange!</p><p></p><p>Normally, a human's divine soul can only fuse with the person after the divine blood is completely activated and the physical body and spiritual soul have broken through to the Divine Realm. How come he can do something only achievable at the Divine Realm while he's still at the King Realm?"</p><p></p><p>However, after thinking for a moment, it couldn't figure it out and could only shake its head.</p><p></p><p>"The universe is vast, and the mysteries are countless. Perhaps my knowledge is still not enough, and I need to cultivate more."</p><p></p><p>With that, it disappeared and merged back into the dragon vein.</p><p></p><p>On the other side, in the Shaolin Academy of the Jianghai City, a strange blood-colored aura was constantly diffusing, as if suppressing yet constantly erupting, with the two forces engaged in a constant struggle.</p><p></p><p>Eventually, the blood qi burst out, overcoming the suppressing force.</p><p></p><p>A blood-colored demonic qi suddenly surged into the sky.</p><p></p><p>Fa Zheng broke out of his meditation in his room, quickly jumping out, his eyes revealing deep solemnity and wariness as he stared intently at the blood-colored figure in front of him.</p><p></p><p>Aro also quickly arrived here and, upon seeing the other party, couldn't help but have his gaze intensify.</p><p></p><p>"This demonic qi is so powerful! What's going on? How can Li Dao Shen release such powerful demonic qi?"</p><p></p><p>Fa Zheng's face was grave as he said, "I don't know either. According to reason, his demonic qi should have been suppressed. Without a special trigger, it shouldn't have erupted like this. How did it suddenly burst out?"</p><p></p><p>Three more, nine thousand.</p><p></p><p>Seeking recommendations, monthly votes, and subscriptions.</p><p></p><p>Thank you, book friend Yuan, for the reward, greatly appreciated.</p><p></p><p>(This chapter is complete)</p>

        <h1>Chapter 254</h1>
        <div class="content">
            <p>Here is the full English translation of the Chinese excerpt:</p><p></p><p>The two generals, Blue Ox and Sealed Dragon, slowly descended to the ground.</p><p></p><p>The two celestial beasts directly locked onto the Martial Arts Library of Jianghai City.</p><p></p><p>The reason was that the Martial Arts Library of Jianghai City had a powerful spiritual vortex.</p><p></p><p>This should be the strongest place in the entire Jianghai City.</p><p></p><p>So if there were any questions, the answers could definitely be found here.</p><p></p><p>The two generals descended and cast their gaze below, quickly locking onto a figure in front of the library.</p><p></p><p>Liu Chengxun.</p><p></p><p>"Innate Eighth-Grade strength? It seems he is a pretty decent character among the human race. I should be able to get some information from him. Let's go find him."</p><p></p><p>The two were determined, descending next to Liu Chengxun.</p><p></p><p>Sealed Dragon immediately struck, the surging spiritual energy directly forming a giant hand, grabbing towards Liu Chengxun's shoulder.</p><p></p><p>Liu Chengxun, who was originally looking at the statue of the Immortal Swordsman, narrowed his eyes and coldly snorted.</p><p></p><p>"What scum dares to sneak attack me? Looking for death!"</p><p></p><p>Liu Chengxun waved his hand and slashed out a sword! The extremely powerful sword energy heavily struck Sealed Dragon's giant hand, immediately causing an explosive sound.</p><p></p><p>The shockwaves stirred, instantly awakening many people, and the library's alarm sounded, with all the administrators quickly retreating through the back door.</p><p></p><p>Liu Chengxun's gaze was cold, the other party wanted to sneak attack him, but ended up being cut by his sword instead.</p><p></p><p>This single sword strike was enough to injure the opponent.</p><p></p><p>Serves him right! </p><p></p><p>For being so stupid and causing trouble, actually targeting him.</p><p></p><p>It's simply courting death.</p><p></p><p>However, as the smoke gradually dissipated and he clearly saw the opponent, Liu Chengxun's eyes suddenly widened.</p><p></p><p>"What? What is this all about?"</p><p></p><p>He simply couldn't believe his eyes.</p><p></p><p>According to reason, the opponent should have been injured by his backhand sword strike.</p><p></p><p>Yet, the opponent was completely unharmed, not a single scratch.</p><p></p><p>Was this some kind of joke? Sealed Dragon looked at his hand and snorted lightly.</p><p></p><p>"Your strength is quite impressive, but unfortunately, your cultivation is too weak. With these little tricks, you can't even break through my defense."</p><p></p><p>Boom! Liu Chengxun suddenly felt all the hair on his body stand on end.</p><p></p><p>His previous move, although not a full-power strike, was at least over 60% of his strength, yet it couldn't even break through the opponent's defense!</p><p></p><p>It was easy to imagine that even if he used his full power, it would only cause the slightest harm to the opponent, not even posing a threat!</p><p></p><p>Damn it! Where did this powerful expert come from? And there were two of them at once? At this moment, Librarian Jiang Chen walked out of the library, seeing this scene, his brows slightly furrowed.</p><p></p><p>"Unexpectedly, there are two powerful experts coming to this small Jianghai City tonight, truly surprising old me."</p><p></p><p>Sealed Dragon and Blue Ox glanced at Jiang Chen without any expression, while Liu Chengxun immediately spoke up:</p><p></p><p>"Librarian Jiang, quickly retreat, these two fellows are terrifyingly powerful! Even I can only hold out for a moment.</p><p></p><p>You must go notify the Nine Realms Alliance, their strength is at least at the Innate Ninth-Grade level!"</p><p></p><p>Sealed Dragon sneered coldly.</p><p></p><p>"Do you think he can still escape tonight? Everyone of the human race here tonight will die!"</p><p></p><p>The Blue Ox above spoke in a cold voice:</p><p></p><p>"Sealed Dragon, don't play around anymore. Finding Sameul and the others is the priority."</p><p></p><p>"Understood."</p><p></p><p>Sealed Dragon responded somewhat unhappily, then directly took action.</p><p></p><p>He did not merely reach out to grab Jiang Chen as before, but instead slightly revealed a portion of his true strength.</p><p></p><p>That terrifying aura overflowed, causing Liu Chengxun's body to suddenly tremble, his soul feeling as if it had fallen into an icy abyss.</p><p></p><p>Too strong! Such powerful cultivation!</p><p></p><p>He guessed wrong, this fellow was not at the Innate Ninth-Grade at all!</p><p></p><p>His strength had already reached the level of a semi-divine beast.</p><p></p><p>It's all over, he's doomed this time.</p><p></p><p>In the next moment, Sealed Dragon waved his hand in the air, three claw marks instantly transforming into three sharp wind blades, shooting towards Liu Chengxun.</p><p></p><p>The strength was truly too powerful, the oppressive aura alone had already immobilized Liu Chengxun's body, not allowing him to move at all.</p><p></p><p>The attack speed was so fast it was terrifying.</p><p></p><p>Liu Chengxun had no way to block it, could only watch helplessly as the attack landed on him.</p><p></p><p>It's over! </p><p></p><p>This time he's really done for! Among cultivators, the stronger the strength, the greater the damage from attacks.</p><p></p><p>If it were the Innate Ninth-Grade Saint Sect masters he had encountered before, at most their single strike would only leave him severely injured, barely clinging to life.</p><p></p><p>But now, this attack would definitely allow him to completely perish, directly exploding into a mist of blood.</p><p></p><p>At that time, even if Immortal Swordsman Senior had extraordinary abilities to resurrect him, it would be impossible.</p><p></p><p>He never expected that by staying in Jianghai City, just to see Immortal Swordsman Senior once, in the end not only would he not see him, but he would be slain, a sense of inexplicable despair shrouding his heart.</p><p></p><p>Those beams of light grew larger and larger in his eyes, he even felt his body starting to be torn apart by that powerful force.</p><p></p><p>Here is the full English translation of the Chinese excerpt:</p><p></p><p>However, at this moment, an unexpected incident suddenly occurred.</p><p></p><p>A golden light suddenly enveloped Liu Chengxun.</p><p></p><p>Boom! The next second, an explosion suddenly rang out, and a mushroom cloud rose into the sky.</p><p></p><p>Feng Long raised his eyebrows slightly, vaguely feeling that something was not quite right.</p><p></p><p>When the dust settled, Liu Chengxun was actually standing unharmed at the original spot.</p><p></p><p>Feng Long couldn't help but be stunned, and the Blue Ox also had a strange look in his eyes.</p><p></p><p>"Hehe, this is after all the territory of the human race, and I am the librarian. Liu Chengxun is now my subordinate. If you were to kill him, how would I continue to survive in the Nine Provinces?"</p><p></p><p>Liu Chengxun mechanically turned his neck, looking at the old librarian Jiang Chen with a blank expression.</p><p></p><p>He was completely dumbfounded.</p><p></p><p>What is this situation? Wasn't his cultivation only at the peak of the Innate Sixth-Grade Grand Master? How could he withstand the attack of a semi-divine beast-level expert? Was he dreaming?</p><p></p><p>The librarian was not an Innate Sixth-Grade expert?</p><p></p><p>He was also a super expert? A human realm powerhouse on the verge of becoming a King? Previously, he had thought of the librarian as a weak person and didn't even pay attention to him.</p><p></p><p>He had even thought that he was the strongest in the entire Jianghai City, apart from the Sword Immortal and Sword God Li Liushui, as well as those Godly Sect experts.</p><p></p><p>But now he realized.</p><p></p><p>It was he himself who was the fool.</p><p></p><p>Feng Long and the Blue Ox glanced at Jiang Chen, their eyes revealing a hint of seriousness, as well as a desire to fight.</p><p></p><p>"Interesting, it seems this trip here was not in vain."</p><p></p><p>"With your strength, capturing Samuels should not be a problem. It seems you are the one who will capture him. Since that's the case, then I'll subdue you and make you hand over Samuels."</p><p></p><p>Feng Long's face looked ferocious.</p><p></p><p>"Blue Ox, this guy was discovered by me first. You are not allowed to make a move. I want to tear him to pieces with my own hands."</p><p></p><p>The Blue Ox chuckled.</p><p></p><p>"That won't do! I haven't made a move in a long time, and my hands are itching to act. Today, I must defeat him, even if the Tiger God himself comes, I insist on it."</p><p></p><p>Feng Long's face turned cold.</p><p></p><p>"Are you trying to fight me?"</p><p></p><p>"If you insist on making a move, I don't mind."</p><p></p><p>Between the two semi-divine beasts, the atmosphere began to become a bit delicate, with swords drawn and gunpowder in the air.</p><p></p><p>At this moment, Jiang Chen spoke again.</p><p></p><p>"There's no need to bother. You two can just attack together."</p><p></p><p>This sentence made Blue Ox and Feng Long pause momentarily, and it also made Liu Chengxun hurriedly say, "Librarian, are you crazy? They are both semi-divine beast experts. Even fighting one-on-one is extremely dangerous, let alone taking on both of them."</p><p></p><p>Jiang Chen's face remained smilingly calm and composed.</p><p></p><p>"Attacking one by one is a waste of time. It's better to attack together, so I can save some effort."</p><p></p><p>Liu Chengxun's heart pounded violently. He looked at Jiang Chen's calm expression and his heart began to race wildly! Could it be that the librarian was not just a powerhouse on the verge of becoming a King, but a true King-level expert? And a male martial artist at that.</p><p></p><p>Oh my god, in his lifetime, he actually got to see one of the two in the Nine Provinces! He hit the jackpot! Even if he didn't get to see the Sword Immortal, staying in Jianghai City this time was not in vain.</p><p></p><p>Tears started to well up in Liu Chengxun's eyes, and he couldn't help but get a bit emotional.</p><p></p><p>Feng Long and the Blue Ox exchanged a glance, their hearts also sinking.</p><p></p><p>Could it be that Jiang Chen was a King-level expert? No, this was just a small city, how could there be such a high-level expert here? They had intelligence that among the human race in the land, there were only five King-level experts, and only two of them were male. How could it be so coincidental that they just happened to run into one of them.</p><p></p><p>"Hmph! Stop pretending to be mysterious! We'll attack together then."</p><p></p><p>The Blue Ox directly called out to Feng Long, and the two of them charged towards Jiang Chen.</p><p></p><p>The auras of the two semi-divine beasts erupted, instantly putting the entire library under immense pressure, with the most concentrated aura fully focused on Jiang Chen.</p><p></p><p>They intended to subdue Jiang Chen with their thunderous might.</p><p></p><p>But unfortunately, just as they approached Jiang Chen, his body suddenly erupted with an even stronger and more violent aura! That burst of aura caused the sky and earth to change color, the clouds to roll, and the wind to howl violently. The terrifying power even impacted the entire Jianghai City, causing countless martial artists to feel their breathing constricted, finding it difficult to even inhale.</p><p></p><p>Feng Long's pupils shrank, and Liu Chengxun was so excited that he almost cried.</p><p></p><p>King-level!</p><p></p><p>It was truly a King-level expert! He actually got to see the legendary King-level powerhouse!</p>

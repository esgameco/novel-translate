        <h1>Chapter 58</h1>
        <div class="content">
            <p>Here is the full English translation of the Chinese excerpt:</p><p></p><p>Late at night, in the deep mountains of the central plains, a furious roar suddenly echoed out, like that of a dragon or a tiger, its powerful pressure shaking the entire forest, causing it to tremble.</p><p></p><p>From a secluded cave, a voice, aged yet full of majesty, slowly emerged.</p><p></p><p>"My people have been killed. Find out who is responsible? Once found, show no mercy!"</p><p></p><p>With this command, a rustling sound swept through the forest, as if some terrifying presence beneath the trees was spreading outwards.</p><p></p><p>Time flashed by, and in the blink of an eye, a night had quietly passed in the dreams of countless people.</p><p></p><p>"Ding-a-ling, ding-a-ling..."</p><p></p><p>In the morning, Ning Yuhen woke from his sleep, sitting up with a start.</p><p></p><p>The surrounding environment left him feeling disoriented.</p><p></p><p>"This is the dormitory? </p><p>Wasn't I supposed to be pursued by Bazan and Meg? How did I end up in the dormitory? Could this be a dream after my death?"</p><p></p><p>Ning Yuhen looked down at himself, his clothes stained with fresh blood, proof that the injuries he had sustained were real.</p><p></p><p>But the items he had left for the librarian were still on the bed, indicating that no one had disturbed the dormitory.</p><p></p><p>"I seem to recall being crushed by Meg's cultivation technique, teetering between life and death, when someone seemed to have saved me. Could it be that person who brought me back here?"</p><p></p><p>Ning Yuhen was not surprised that the person had returned him to the library, as he was wearing the library's work uniform with his name tag. It seemed the person had seen this and brought him back. But how did they know where his dormitory was? Could they also be a library employee?</p><p></p><p>As he pondered this, a knock came at his door, and a deep male voice called out from outside.</p><p></p><p>"Ning Yuhen, are you awake?"</p><p></p><p>Ning Yuhen's heart raced as he hurried to open the door, finding one of the library's security guards standing there.</p><p></p><p>"You're awake, that's good. Our captain asked me to come check on you."</p><p></p><p>Ning Yuhen's heart skipped a beat.</p><p></p><p>"Was it your captain who saved me?"</p><p></p><p>"No, it was me. I was on patrol in the early morning when I found you lying on the steps at the library entrance. No matter how much I called, you wouldn't wake up. At first, I thought you were going to die, seeing all the blood on you. But our captain checked you over and said you were just unconscious, so he had me bring you back to your dorm."</p><p></p><p>"I see."</p><p></p><p>Ning Yuhen's face fell slightly.</p><p></p><p>It seemed the person who saved him was not a library employee, but had simply left him at the library before leaving. This meant the trail had gone cold, and he might have trouble finding that person again.</p><p></p><p>"Are you alright? What happened to you yesterday? Why were you covered in blood?"</p><p></p><p>"It's nothing serious. I went out for a walk and encountered a beast spirit. I was seriously injured, but managed to escape back here. Since I cultivate a healing-type technique, the wounds have already healed."</p><p></p><p>"I see. Well, you should be more careful from now on, especially about going out at night."</p><p></p><p>"Yes, I understand. Thank you."</p><p></p><p>The guard waved his hand.</p><p></p><p>"As long as you're okay. I need to go get some rest now."</p><p></p><p>"Alright, goodbye."</p><p></p><p>Ning Yuhen nodded, closing the door and beginning to wash the blood off himself.</p><p></p><p>He had originally planned to leave Jianghai City, but now he suddenly didn't want to leave.</p><p></p><p>Even though he didn't know who that senior had been, since they had helped him, they couldn't have bad intentions.</p><p></p><p>With such a powerful senior protecting Jianghai City, perhaps he shouldn't leave after all.</p><p></p><p>Here is the full English translation of the Chinese excerpt:</p><p></p><p>What's there to be afraid of?</p><p></p><p>At least it's much safer here than going to other unfamiliar places.</p><p></p><p>After finishing his morning routine, Ning Yuhen came to the third floor of the library and clocked in for work.</p><p></p><p>Soon, Ye Xiao also arrived, and Ning Yuhen quickly stood up to greet him.</p><p></p><p>"Manager Ye, you're here."</p><p>Ye Xiao nodded.</p><p></p><p>"I heard you were injured yesterday?"</p><p></p><p>Ning Yuhen nodded slightly.</p><p></p><p>"I encountered a beast spirit, but it's not a big deal. I know some healing techniques, so my injuries are almost healed."</p><p></p><p>"That's good. By the way, you said you were going back to your hometown yesterday, why didn't you go?"</p><p></p><p>"Ah? About that... I suddenly received another call from home, and there's no issue, so I don't need to go back."</p><p></p><p>"That's good then."</p><p></p><p>Ye Xiao played along with Ning Yuhen's act, not exposing his secret, nor did he feel like exposing it.</p><p></p><p>Everyone has their own little secrets, just like he didn't want Ning Yuhen to know about his own matters.</p><p></p><p>And he didn't need Ning Yuhen to tell him.</p><p></p><p>Before eliminating those two individuals with beast spirit bloodlines yesterday, Ye Xiao had already used the Taixuan Tiangong technique to scan their memories.</p><p></p><p>Their cultivation was far inferior to Ye Xiao's, unable to resist Ye Xiao's mental search, and they didn't even notice it.</p><p></p><p>In this world, there are many private organizations that claim to protect beastmen as their purpose.</p><p></p><p>For example, the Western vampires! Of course, under the guise of protection, they are actually recruiting soldiers and finding subordinates.</p><p></p><p>By gathering beastmen, they can gain power and profit from their cultivation.</p><p></p><p>The sect that Ning Yuhen joined is called the Beast God Cult.</p><p></p><p>The controller of this sect is rarely seen by others.</p><p></p><p>He is very mysterious and has never appeared before anyone else.</p><p></p><p>Because the sect has a strict hierarchy, the strong oppressing the weak is a common occurrence.</p><p></p><p>In addition, this sect often massacres the human race.</p><p></p><p>Ning Yuhen didn't want to be involved in such corruption, so he defected.</p><p></p><p>"Since you're not going back home, then lend me the healing techniques you mentioned in the text message yesterday. You said you would leave them for me."</p><p></p><p>"Oh, okay."</p><p></p><p>Ning Yuhen immediately handed over the techniques he had brought.</p><p></p><p>Ye Xiao received the techniques and then handed over two other manuals.</p><p></p><p>"These two manuals are rare copies I purchased from other places, not available in the library. They should be suitable for your cultivation and won't be a loss for you."</p><p></p><p>Ning Yuhen waved his hands repeatedly.</p><p></p><p>"Manager, that's not necessary. My techniques aren't worth much, I can't let you spend money on me."</p><p></p><p>"Take them. You should cultivate some self-defense techniques as well. This time you were lucky, but next time may not be the same."</p><p></p><p>Ye Xiao insisted and placed the manuals in Ning Yuhen's hands.</p><p></p><p>These were two manuals he had printed himself, which he had written, equivalent to quasi-grandmaster level techniques. Although not extremely powerful, they would be more than enough for Ning Yuhen, and Ye Xiao wouldn't be at a loss in this exchange.</p><p></p><p>After obtaining the manuals, Ye Xiao went to the side to read a book.</p><p></p><p>Ning Yuhen could only sigh helplessly.</p><p></p><p>However, he felt quite happy in his heart, as the manager treated him with great respect, something he had never experienced in the Beast God Cult.</p><p></p><p>Decided, he would work hard here in the library, following the manager, strive for promotion and raise, and climb to the peak of his life.</p><p></p><p>This is the end of the chapter.</p>

        <h1>Chapter 160</h1>
        <div class="content">
            <p>Here is the full English translation of the Chinese excerpt:</p><p></p><p>Ye Xiao quickly smelted the pig iron into a sub-transcendent-level weapon.</p><p></p><p>As long as he passed the assessment, there was no need to draw too much attention.</p><p></p><p>When the real competition begins, he will then reveal a bit of his true strength.</p><p></p><p>Apart from that, there is nothing else to worry about.</p><p></p><p>Soon, Ye Xiao obtained the competition participation certificate by passing the assessment.</p><p></p><p>He used a fake identity, and with the help of Taixuan Tiangong, he simply modified the assessor's memory to get everything settled.</p><p></p><p>After obtaining the participation certificate, he had to wait until the next day to enter the competition arena for the formal competition.</p><p></p><p>The competition mechanism was a single-elimination format, with one match determining the winner and loser, without any preliminary rounds or multiple stages of elimination leading up to the final championship.</p><p></p><p>All the participants had to enter the arena at the same time, then forge a weapon or armor, which would be judged and scored by a panel of nationally renowned forging masters.</p><p></p><p>The forging materials would be provided by the hosting organization, but participants could also bring their own.</p><p></p><p>This was to accommodate some forgers who were relatively specialized in certain areas.</p><p></p><p>Even if a forger was specialized, as long as they could reach a certain standard in their area of expertise, they would be considered an exceptional talent, and the rigid competition rules should not restrict their performance and cause the Nine Provinces to miss out on such talents.</p><p></p><p>Of course, the hosting organization did not need to worry about some participants bringing expensive rare materials to gain an unfair advantage, because the more precious the material, the higher the technical requirement for forging it. If a forger's skills were not up to par, the item forged with high-end materials would actually be inferior to what they could forge with low-end materials.</p><p></p><p>The materials provided by the hosting organization were at an appropriate level - not too difficult, nor too easy.</p><p></p><p>As a result, very few forgers would bring their own materials.</p><p></p><p>The competition results were determined by both the quality of the forged item and the forging time.</p><p></p><p>If participants brought their own materials, points would be added or deducted based on the quality of those materials.</p><p></p><p>As for the rewards, the top 1,000 competitors in the forging competition would all receive prizes.</p><p></p><p>This was because the number of participants was extremely large, as the population of the Nine Provinces was immense, and even though the proportion of forgers and alchemists was small, the total number was still staggering. The number of participants each year was at least over 10,000, and this was with an age limit in place - otherwise, the number would be even higher.</p><p></p><p>The prizes were distributed according to the rankings, and Ye Xiao was only interested in the top prizes, which included: a core of a peak Saint-Emperor-level beast, a pair of claws of a peak Saint-Emperor-level beast, 3 jin of rare spatial purple steel, a piece of special blood wood material, and a block of spatial purple crystal.</p><p></p><p>Ye Xiao was not particularly interested in the competition rules, as he was confident in his forging abilities. While his combat strength at the early Transcendent Eighth Realm was lacking, in terms of forging skills, there were likely not many in this world who could easily forge imperial-grade weapons.</p><p></p><p>What surprised him was that the spatial purple crystal was only the fifth-place prize, but upon reflection, it made sense, as forging spatial materials, though excellent, was not an easy task and required exceptional forging skills. Most participants under the age of 30 would not have such high-level skills.</p><p></p><p>This was perfect for Ye Xiao, as the challenge would be even simpler for him. He had decided to forge an exceptional weapon and claim the spatial purple crystal as his prize, without drawing too much attention to himself.</p><p></p><p>Arriving at a secluded small forest on the outskirts of the city, Ye Xiao began processing the several Saint-Emperor-level beasts he had captured. He had not yet revived them, but had sealed their souls within himself, planning to revive and raise them after returning to Jianghai City.</p><p></p><p>Now, Ye Xiao intended to extract their spirit pearls and use the Taixuan Tiangong to analyze their imperial arts, in order to obtain the ones he needed.</p><p></p><p>Among them were a chicken, a fish, a turtle, a deer, and a ginseng. All were Ye Xiao's favorite foods.</p><p></p><p>The turtle, deer, and ginseng were also highly nourishing.</p><p></p><p>Although Ye Xiao no longer needed such nourishment, having them was still much better than not.</p><p></p><p>Moreover, their true value lay in their ability to enhance cultivation and vitality, which was far superior to the other types.</p><p></p><p>However, Ye Xiao was somewhat disappointed after analyzing the spirit pearls through the Taixuan Tiangong, as there were only two imperial arts - one was the Earth Escape Art belonging to the ginseng beast's Immortal Elder.</p><p></p><p>Here is the full English translation of the Chinese excerpt:</p><p></p><p>From the stellar core, it was refined. It's not just saying that it can only traverse through the soil, the stones, or even the metals, and its speed is not slow either. Ye Xiao's analysis concluded that it is only slightly slower than the Divine Will Incantation.</p><p></p><p>But in the future, it can be combined with the Divine Will Incantation and an Imperial Art.</p><p></p><p>This can also be considered a huge gain, not a loss.</p><p></p><p>Ye Xiao immediately imprinted it onto his Golden Book Spiritual Sense, allowing the Golden Book Spiritual Sense to begin cultivating it.</p><p></p><p>As for the other Imperial Art, it was a bit of a headache. It was a healing art. Ye Xiao already had three Imperial Arts - the補天術 (補天Shu), the Stellar Incantation, and the Extreme Healing Art.</p><p></p><p>And this healing art was of the same fundamental type as the補天術 (補天Shu).</p><p></p><p>So it could not be recorded into Ye Xiao's Golden Book Spiritual Sense, which was a bit of a pity.</p><p></p><p>Despite the pity, since the Heavenly Dao did not give it, Ye Xiao had no way to obtain it.</p><p></p><p>As for the other three Stellar Beasts, since their bloodlines were only at the Sub-Dragon level and had not yet reached the Dragon level, their stellar cores did not contain any Imperial Arts.</p><p></p><p>Ji Feng had just formed a Dragon-level bloodline, and her stellar core had not yet formed any Imperial Arts.</p><p></p><p>They might cultivate Imperial Arts, but that would require forcibly breaking through their souls. With Ye Xiao's current spiritual cultivation, it would be a bit of a hassle.</p><p></p><p>Ye Xiao planned to wait until his own cultivation had risen further, reaching the point where he could easily subdue them and search their souls.</p><p></p><p>This was also the purpose of raising them.</p><p></p><p>Ye Xiao understood this, after all, it was impossible to casually obtain a Celestial Ancestor-level Stellar Beast with a Dragon-level bloodline, as that would be far too valuable.</p><p></p><p>The vast majority of Stellar Beasts who cultivate to the Celestial Ancestor level are 99% sweat, plus that 1% of opportunity.</p><p></p><p>This was also why Ye Xiao originally wanted to cultivate the Illusory Jade Dragon, a Dragon-level bloodline juvenile, which was indeed very difficult to find.</p><p></p><p>However, Ye Xiao also found a Claw Technique, a Fist Technique, and a Leg Technique in the stellar cores of Ji Feng and the other three Stellar Beasts.</p><p></p><p>They were all basic cultivation methods, but having something is better than having nothing.</p><p></p><p>Ye Xiao absorbed all these cultivation methods into his Golden Book Spiritual Sense, allowing the Golden Book to begin cultivating them.</p><p></p><p>Since they were three basic cultivation methods, the Golden Book Spiritual Sense was able to cultivate them quickly.</p><p></p><p>Among them, after cultivating the Fist Technique, it began to faintly flash with a golden light, indicating that the Fist Technique was about to be able to be synthesized.</p><p></p><p>At that time, he would be able to synthesize another Imperial Art.</p><p></p><p>Looking at it this way, the gains from this trip were quite substantial.</p><p></p><p>This leave of absence was well worth it.</p><p></p><p>One Imperial Art, three basic cultivation methods, five Celestial Ancestor-level Stellar Beasts, and he would even obtain a Spatial Purple Crystal tomorrow.</p><p></p><p>The gains were quite impressive. He was very satisfied.</p><p></p><p>On the other side, in the most luxurious yacht hotel on the Hu City River, two men were dining.</p><p></p><p>One was middle-aged, the other was young.</p><p></p><p>Their attire and appearance were both exquisite and expensive.</p><p></p><p>The middle-aged man spoke first.</p><p></p><p>"Qiu Feng, you are the most outstanding disciple I have taught over the years. At just 27 years old, you have reached the level of a high-grade Forging Master. This truly makes me proud.</p><p></p><p>But tomorrow will be the time when you truly make me feel honored."</p><p></p><p>Qiu Feng's expression was indifferent as he cut a piece of steak from the plate in front of him, put it in his mouth, and responded while savoring the taste:</p><p></p><p>"Teacher, you can rest assured. After all these years of receiving your guidance, I will definitely win the championship in this competition and bring glory to you."</p><p></p><p>The middle-aged man nodded, with a touch of sentiment:</p><p></p><p>"In the past, I also participated in this competition. Although I won the first place, it was only after the Forging Professor from another state of the Nine Provinces, who was over 30 years old, could no longer participate.</p><p></p><p>Therefore, this has been a lifelong regret of mine.</p><p></p><p>Now that I have taught you, you can participate in the Nine Provinces competition at least twice more. This is your opportunity, and the greatest chance for you to make a name for yourself in the Nine Provinces."</p><p></p><p>Qiu Feng's eyes flickered.</p><p></p><p>"Teacher, could it be that you are referring to the renowned Forging Master, Professor Zhang Guangyang, from the Hu State Martial Arts Academy, who was once hailed as the inheritor of Forging in the Nine Provinces?"</p><p></p><p>"Correct, it's him!" </p><p></p><p>The middle-aged man's gaze suddenly became somewhat fierce after hearing his name.</p><p></p><p>"Back then, I was constantly defeated by him, being the runner-up for four straight years, until he left, and I finally obtained the first place. </p><p></p><p>But I know I didn't truly win.</p><p></p><p>If he were still here, I would still be losing to him.</p><p></p><p>I heard that his disciple will also be participating in this competition, and he is said to be an extraordinary genius!</p><p></p><p>If my guess is correct, the champion will be decided between the two of you!"</p>

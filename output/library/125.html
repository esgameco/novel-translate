        <h1>Chapter 125</h1>
        <div class="content">
            <p>Here is the full English translation of the Chinese excerpt:</p><p></p><p>Ye Xiao still remembered that in his previous life, he had watched some movies where many undercover agents did their jobs very well, but in the end, they ended up becoming the boss of the other side.</p><p></p><p>Would Huan Liuli also have reached the high-level position of the other side?</p><p></p><p>After all, she had the bloodline of a dragon-level beast, so the other side should value her quite highly.</p><p></p><p>Moreover, he didn't know if there were any Saint Monarch experts among them. If there were, they should have certain methods to erase the mental imprint they had left in Huan Liuli's mind.</p><p></p><p>If that was the case, Huan Liuli's rebellion would not be impossible.</p><p></p><p>Thinking about this, Ye Xiao's eyes became slightly cold.</p><p></p><p>If Huan Liuli had really betrayed him, he would definitely not let her off lightly.</p><p></p><p>He played with the spatial storage ring in his hand, his gaze flickering with deep thoughts.</p><p></p><p>Tomorrow was the time when the Seven-Star Convergence would open. At that time, the Star Beasts would definitely activate the spatial teleportation array within this ring.</p><p></p><p>At that time, he would seize the opportunity to rush over and find Huan Liuli.</p><p></p><p>Whoever dares to betray him must die!</p><p></p><p>Meanwhile, in the valley under the Ten Thousand Great Mountains at the border between Chu State and Central State, there were shrieks of agony.</p><p></p><p>"Ah—! Stop hitting! Stop hitting! My bones are going to break! Wuwuwu..."</p><p></p><p>Huan Liuli was tied up on a stone pillar, not knowing how many whips she had been beaten with.</p><p></p><p>Her little face was tear-stained, looking utterly pitiful.</p><p></p><p>"Ptui! As a Star Beast, you are enslaved by humans and even become a traitor, you still have the face to beg for mercy? You deserve it! Hei~tui~!"</p><p></p><p>The one whipping her was a black panther-like Star Beast Patriarch.</p><p></p><p>After spitting at Huan Liuli, he jumped down from the high platform, inciting the excited roars of the surrounding Star Beasts.</p><p></p><p>The Black Panther Patriarch went to another Star Beast expert who had fully evolved into a human form, with only two cheeks and a strange mark, not having fully evolved into a human shape.</p><p></p><p>"I've long suspected that she was up to no good, acting all mysterious and sneaky, occasionally sending out mental waves. Unfortunately, she has the bloodline of the Illusion Cat, which is naturally suited for cultivating spiritual power. The subordinates I sent to monitor her are only second-rate in spiritual power cultivation. They've heard it many times, but they only remembered one term, but they don't know what it represents. When they came back to ask Grand Patriarch Lion Quei, that term turned out to be 'Master'! I'm so angry. This damned traitor cat."</p><p></p><p>The Saint Envoy nodded.</p><p></p><p>"It's good that you discovered her spy identity in time, otherwise our counterattack plan against the human race might have been in vain."</p><p></p><p>"Saint Envoy, I've already cut off her connection with her human master. But since she is a mighty Dragon-level Star Beast, betraying us to become a human's pet, killing her as a warning would be even better, wouldn't it?"</p><p></p><p>The elder called the Saint Envoy glanced at Huan Liuli.</p><p></p><p>"She is still a child. She has been misled by humans for the time being, but with time, she will gradually correct herself.</p><p></p><p>Letting her break off from the humans is just cutting off her retreat path. If she wants to find the humans again, she will have to consider whether she will be killed by the enraged humans.</p><p></p><p>After all, she is also a Dragon-level Star Beast, and in the future, she will be a great help to us.</p><p></p><p>It's better not to kill her if possible."</p><p></p><p>"The Saint Envoy is wise."</p><p></p><p>"Issue the order, open the spatial transmission to several major cities at exactly midnight tonight, and exterminate the humans by noon!"</p><p></p><p>"Yes!"</p><p></p><p>The Star Beasts lined up and planned, countless Star Beasts letting out bloodthirsty roars in the valley.</p><p></p><p>Huan Liuri, no longer being whipped, couldn't help but heave a sigh of relief.</p><p></p><p>She looked at the Star Beasts below and shook her head.</p><p></p><p>These poor fellows don't know what kind of monster they are about to face. Even with the Seven-Star Convergence, these tens of thousands of them will probably all be turned into skewers by that guy.</p><p></p><p>Originally, she would have had some sympathy for them as fellow Star Beasts, but since they had beaten her so badly, she couldn't blame herself for being heartless and ungrateful.</p><p></p><p>Among them, there were chickens, ducks, geese, rabbits, cattle, sheep, dogs, fish, shrimp, crabs, and all kinds of species.</p><p></p><p>When the time comes, she will definitely eat her fill of them, whether grilled, boiled, stewed, or fried.</p><p></p><p>Come to think of it, at this moment, Huan Liuri suddenly felt that following Ye Xiao wasn't that bad after all.</p><p></p><p>At least she could eat and drink well, and her cultivation could also improve quickly.</p><p></p><p>Should she consider extending the time a bit?</p><p></p><p>For example, first be his slave for seven hundred years? After seven hundred years, her cultivation should have risen greatly, and she could become independent at that time.</p><p></p><p>Time passed bit by bit, and soon it was midnight.</p><p></p><p>At this moment, the seven dazzling stars in the sky had finally aligned in a straight line as their orbits shifted.</p><p></p><p>At this moment, there was a strange change in the magnetic field between heaven and earth.</p><p></p><p>The concentration of spiritual energy in the air suddenly surged rapidly.</p><p></p><p>Ye Xiao, who was reading in the library at night, slowly walked to the window. As a peak Grand Patriarch, he could easily feel this subtle change.</p><p></p><p>"Is it about to begin?"</p><p></p><p>Here is the full English translation of the Chinese excerpt:</p><p></p><p>He vaguely felt that the spiritual power of the Golden Book within him was becoming restless.</p><p></p><p>This caused Ye Xiao to raise his eyebrows slightly.</p><p></p><p>The spiritual power of the Golden Book was absorbing spiritual energy at an accelerating rate.</p><p></p><p>What was going on?</p><p></p><p>Could it be that this Seven-Star Linked Pearl had a special effect on the human spirit? Filled with doubt, Ye Xiao unleashed the Taixuan Tiangong, spreading his spiritual power outwards at high speed.</p><p></p><p>However, he found that the spirits of the other humans had not undergone any major changes.</p><p></p><p>What was this all about?</p><p></p><p>Was it only his own spirit, like the Star Beasts, that was reacting to the Seven-Star Linked Pearl?</p><p></p><p>What was so special about the spiritual power of the Golden Book? But time did not give Ye Xiao much chance to ponder, for he suddenly sensed a strange spatial fluctuation emanating from the ring in his pocket.</p><p></p><p>The spatial transmission array within the ring had been activated.</p><p></p><p>The Star Beast troops were coming! With a thought, Ye Xiao instantly vanished from the spot, reappearing in an inconspicuous area on the outskirts of Jianghai City.</p><p></p><p>He placed the storage ring on the ground, and the spatial array gradually took shape, forming a massive transmission portal over ten meters in diameter.</p><p></p><p>Ye Xiao could clearly feel the intense bloodthirsty aura coming from the other side of the portal.</p><p></p><p>At this moment, the Taixuan Tiangong had completely covered an area hundreds of miles around, and the surrounding cities of Wanghai City had already begun to descend into chaos.</p><p></p><p>The two closest cities had already started to hear cries of alarm.</p><p></p><p>"There are Star Beasts! The Star Beasts have come!"</p><p>"Where did these Star Beasts come from? How can there be so many?"</p><p>"Ah—!"</p><p>"Defend! Defend!"</p><p></p><p>Various panicked screams and shrieks were gradually reaching them.</p><p></p><p>Ye Xiao knew that it would not be long before countless Star Beasts burst out from this spatial portal, attempting to devour and destroy the human race of Jianghai City.</p><p></p><p>Taking a deep breath, Ye Xiao's gaze suddenly turned icy cold.</p><p></p><p>Of course, he would not allow such a thing to happen.</p><p></p><p>When danger was about to arrive, one must greet it with a big cannon, drowning it in the cradle.</p><p></p><p>With a thought, a brilliant golden sword beam erupted from behind Ye Xiao, containing the powerful sword intent of the Heavenly Slash, the mighty spiritual energy of a peak Grand Master, and the formidable amplification power of the Imperial Art Technique.</p><p></p><p>Immediately following were the second, third, and fourth beams.</p><p></p><p>Soon, the entire night sky behind Ye Xiao was illuminated, with countless golden sword beams lighting up nearly half of Jianghai City.</p><p></p><p>The various experts of Jianghai City, sensing this power, quickly gathered together, their eyes filled with awe as they watched the spectacle.</p><p></p><p>"Such tremendous power! Heavens, this power is truly awe-inspiring, making one find it hard to believe."</p><p>"Among the entire Nine Provinces, how many can accomplish this feat?"</p><p>"Sword beams! Could it be the sword art master of our Jianghai City?"</p><p>"It must be him! It has to be him!"</p><p>"But why would he appear at this time? Our Jianghai City has not yet encountered any Star Beasts."</p><p></p><p>Just as the crowd was puzzled, Dou Tianyu hurriedly rushed over, shouting loudly, "Everyone, a great disaster has occurred! The cities of Lingnan and Wanghai, as well as the surrounding areas, have all been subjected to massive Star Beast attacks!"</p><p></p><p>"How is that possible? Weren't those cities all thoroughly cleared by the Grand Master Facheng of the Luozhou Shaolin Martial Arts Academy?"</p><p>"Even if there were Star Beasts, it couldn't be on such a large scale, right? Have you made some mistake?"</p><p></p><p>Dou Tianyu stomped his feet anxiously.</p><p></p><p>"It's true! The cities are now in complete chaos, with Star Beasts suddenly bursting out from within and catching them off guard. They're all in a frenzy now."</p><p></p><p>The crowd looked at each other, their eyes filled with shock.</p><p></p><p>Large-scale Star Beast attacks, and from within the cities? Could it be... transmission arrays? But transmission arrays were not ordinary formations - establishing them would require a great deal of effort, and their presence could not have gone unnoticed.</p><p></p><p>If the Star Beasts wanted to set up arrays in several cities, they would undoubtedly have been discovered. At this moment, Dou Changfeng suddenly thought of something.</p><p></p><p>"Storage rings! Wasn't the East Wind Auction House auctioning storage rings in several cities last month?"</p><p></p><p>He had seen in a book before that transmission arrays could be engraved inside storage rings, and they could have extraordinary effects in the war against the Star Beasts.</p><p></p><p>Connecting this to the recent heated auctions of storage rings in those cities, he immediately guessed how the Star Beasts had infiltrated the cities.</p><p></p><p>At these words, the expressions of the crowd changed drastically.</p><p></p><p>"Damn it, where is our Jianghai City's storage ring?"</p><p>"The one who bought the ring was the CEO of the Hengxiao Construction Group, Ma Chunheng."</p><p>"Quick! Contact him immediately!"</p>

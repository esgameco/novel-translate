        <h1>Chapter 48</h1>
        <div class="content">
            <p>Here is the full English translation of the Chinese excerpt:</p><p></p><p>"You can give it a try," he said.</p><p></p><p>The two were in opposition, and the air was rapidly filled with the acrid smell of gunpowder.</p><p></p><p>The speed of the lightning strikes was increasing, as the dark clouds had gathered too much, causing a change in the weather. The light rain that had just stopped had instantly become heavier!</p><p></p><p>Boom! When a bolt of lightning struck between the two, it was as if the referee had blown the whistle.</p><p></p><p>Yang Zhengyi's mind moved, and the long sword on his back automatically drew out, emitting a cold glint and a buzzing sound in the air.</p><p></p><p>Hum~!</p><p></p><p>A sharp, piercing sound.</p><p></p><p>The three-foot blue sword transformed into a thunderous lightning bolt, charging straight at Aier Wang's face.</p><p></p><p>Aier Wang's eyes narrowed slightly. Although his words were flippant, he did not take the fight lightly at all.</p><p></p><p>He thrust out both hands, and the thunderclouds in the sky sent down two bolts of lightning, forming two lightning balls in his palms.</p><p></p><p>The lightning balls and the three-foot blue sword collided, immediately unleashing a vast shockwave that swept across the entire river and sea.</p><p></p><p>The intense downpour was, at that moment, literally sliced open, and then poured down onto the city below once more.</p><p></p><p>The sword spun and flew back, returning to Yang Zhengyi's hand. He stepped down, and a circle of invisible ripples spread out, his figure disappearing from the original spot.</p><p></p><p>"The only thing your school can do is this little bit of footwork," Aier Wang snorted coldly, quickly bringing his hands together in the air, attracting the lightning in the sky to rapidly gather, forming a lightning cage that firmly locked him inside, defending against the surrounding attacks.</p><p></p><p>Moments later, a violent explosion suddenly came from Aier Wang's back, the lightning cage broken open. Aier Wang turned around and threw a punch, the lightning from the cage all being absorbed into his fist.</p><p></p><p>In the instant of the punch, the sword also stabbed towards Aier Wang's fist.</p><p></p><p>The power of the lightning and the sword clashed again, and this time the explosion was even stronger!</p><p></p><p>The shockwave directly blew the two of them apart. Aier Wang's body was pierced with several bloody holes, while Yang Zhengyi's upper garment was also destroyed, his upper body badly scorched by the lightning.</p><p></p><p>However, what was surprising was that his body, just like Aier Wang's, was quickly healing.</p><p></p><p>When his wounds had fully healed, the area around his ribs was now pure white, covered in white fur, exactly the same as Aier Wang's skin.</p><p></p><p>Aier Wang paused, then burst out laughing.</p><p></p><p>"Hahaha, I was wondering why you were able to survive for over a hundred years after I hit you with my Thunder Fist, when you should have been unable to. It turns out you transplanted my own cells! No wonder I just felt your aura was a bit off, with a beast-like essence."</p><p></p><p>Yang Zhengyi's expression remained indifferent: "As long as I can kill you, I don't care what I have to do."</p><p></p><p>"Ridiculous, you who can only survive by using my own cells, what right do you have to be arrogant in front of me!" </p><p></p><p>Yang Zhengyi charged forward with his sword again.</p><p></p><p>"If you were at your peak, I wouldn't be able to defeat you. But now, you're only a clone, with the power of a fourth-rank Grandmaster. Killing you is no problem."</p><p></p><p>Aier Wang snorted lightly and met the attack.</p><p></p><p>The two clashed in the air, exchanging over a hundred strikes in a single second.</p><p></p><p>The violent tremors of energy released attacks that struck the riverbanks, blasting out one deep crater after another.</p><p></p><p>Inside the Jianhai City, the three Sect Masters Qin Shenglong and the others, even though they were hundreds of miles away, couldn't help but feel a shudder.</p><p></p><p>How terrifying!</p><p></p><p>Is this what a battle between Grandmasters is like?</p><p></p><p>Here is the full English translation of the Chinese excerpt:</p><p></p><p>Above the two people, the wind and clouds were stirred up. Some young people hiding at home began to take short videos of the sky and post them online.</p><p></p><p>This immediately sparked a huge discussion frenzy online.</p><p></p><p>"My god, whose big shot is this? The heavenly phenomenon has appeared because of their fight!"</p><p></p><p>"The surging winds and clouds, this must be a grand master, only a grand master can create such disturbances!"</p><p></p><p>"Is the city of Jianghai that impressive? They even have a grand master?"</p><p></p><p>On the battlefield, after a hundred moves, Yang Zhengyi seized the opportunity, his sword like a venomous dragon, piercing Aier Wang's chest at an extremely tricky angle, frantically injecting true qi, instantly tearing apart Aier Wang's internal organs.</p><p></p><p>"Puchi."</p><p></p><p>Aier Wang spat out a mouthful of fresh blood, splashing it on Yang Zhengyi's face, making him look as terrifying as a fierce ghost.</p><p></p><p>"You - ! Your sword technique has actually reached such a powerful level?"</p><p></p><p>Yang Zhengyi's face was cold.</p><p></p><p>"Do you think I've been idle for over a hundred years? I have practiced my master's sword technique to the pinnacle, just for this day! To kill you!"</p><p></p><p>Aier Wang hugged his sword with both hands, his face full of despair.</p><p></p><p>"Damn it! I actually fell at the hands of you, a mere insignificant ant! I'm unwilling to accept this!"</p><p></p><p>"Don't worry, your other clones will soon follow you."</p><p></p><p>With that, Yang Zhengyi prepared to draw his sword and completely shatter Aier Wang's body, cutting off all his vitality.</p><p></p><p>However, at this moment, he suddenly found that he was unable to pull out the precious sword.</p><p></p><p>A bad feeling suddenly surged in his heart.</p><p></p><p>Sure enough, when he looked up, Aier Wang's mocking face came into view.</p><p></p><p>"I was just joking with you, idiot! Did you really think that with your meager strength, you could kill me?</p><p></p><p>Even though I've weakened, it doesn't mean you've become stronger, fool!"</p><p></p><p>In the blink of an eye, Aier Wang suddenly struck, palm lightning striking Yang Zhengyi's chest.</p><p></p><p>Boom - ! A violent explosion instantly scorched and deeply caved in Yang Zhengyi's chest.</p><p></p><p>The tremendous force sent Yang Zhengyi crashing into the ground like a cannonball, creating a huge deep pit that was flooded by the river water.</p><p></p><p>Before the river water could swallow him, Aier Wang lashed out with an electric whip, locking around his throat and pulling him back into the air.</p><p></p><p>"Cough, cough..."</p><p></p><p>Yang Zhengyi coughed up a mouthful of blood, violently coughing a few times.</p><p></p><p>"How is this possible? You're just a clone! How can this be?"</p><p></p><p>Aier Wang looked at him with extreme disdain.</p><p></p><p>"Do you think I was the only one cultivating for over a hundred years? Even as a clone, I've been diligently cultivating, waiting for the day of rebirth and fusion! So even my current clone is stronger than the one that was just sealed over a hundred years ago! You foolish and ignorant humans always like to use the perspective of an ant to judge realms you have not yet reached! Yet you don't know that the one you've provoked is a god you must revere for eternity!</p><p></p><p>If you don't let me out, humanity can still have ten years of peace!</p><p></p><p>But unfortunately, you've released me, and now I can release my other clones. The moment I fuse into my main body, it will be a disaster for you humans!"</p><p></p><p>(Chapter end)</p>

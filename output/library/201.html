        <h1>Chapter 201</h1>
        <div class="content">
            <p>Here is the full English translation of the Chinese excerpt:</p><p></p><p>Xia Bingning swore that she had never seen such a shocking scene in her life.</p><p></p><p>A cultivator at the innate eighth rank, when facing a star beast of the same level, actually killed one with a single move! It was like a tiger slapping a rabbit, flattening a small rabbit with a single palm strike.</p><p></p><p>That was an innate eighth rank divine ancestor star beast! Not some random cat or dog, nor some insignificant insect. But in Ye Xiao's hands, it felt as if it was not even at the innate eighth rank, but rather at the post-celestial eighth rank. At this moment, the other star beasts behind it had sensed Ye Xiao's immense strength, but their speed was too fast, and they couldn't stop in time.</p><p></p><p>The third star beast had just managed to slow down its speed when a huge force suddenly came from behind! It was its companion behind it who couldn't brake in time and collided into it.</p><p></p><p>This force directly pushed it in front of Ye Xiao.</p><p></p><p>Terror made its face twist into a horrifying expression.</p><p></p><p>Although it was at the same cultivation level as Ye Xiao, in its eyes, Ye Xiao was like the grim reaper come to claim its life.</p><p></p><p>Before it could even let out a scream, Ye Xiao's Tathagata Divine Palm had already been unleashed.</p><p></p><p>Boom! The golden palm print exploded on the ground, directly turning the opponent into mincemeat and even creating a massive crater in the earth.</p><p></p><p>The remaining three divine ancestor star beasts didn't dare to stay for even a moment longer. </p><p></p><p>They all unleashed their strongest powers and frantically fled backwards.</p><p></p><p>But unfortunately, they couldn't escape from Ye Xiao at all.</p><p></p><p>The Imperial Extreme Sword Technique was deployed, and numerous sword lights like thunderbolts darted through the ground.</p><p></p><p>Boom, boom, boom. In the blink of an eye, they had caught up to the three divine ancestor star beasts.</p><p></p><p>The massive energy struck them, making them scream in agony as their bodies shuddered.</p><p></p><p>Seizing this critical moment, Ye Xiao raised his hand and unleashed three Boundless Calamity Fingers.</p><p></p><p>The three Boundless Calamity Fingers, infused with the power of thunderous might, pierced through the heads of the three divine ancestor star beasts in an instant.</p><p></p><p>Annihilated! Not a single one left!</p><p></p><p>"So strong!" </p><p></p><p>Above, Xia Bingning was completely dumbfounded after witnessing this scene. She had originally pulled Ye Xiao over, wanting him to help guard above so that Wan Ziqian Ye wouldn't escape while she was fighting.</p><p></p><p>She had thought that Ye Xiao was no different from other ordinary innate eighth rank cultivators, and that she could even take on two of them.</p><p></p><p>But the result was the opposite - the joke was on her.</p><p></p><p>This Ye Xiao was clearly overwhelmingly powerful, to the point that she couldn't even comprehend it.</p><p></p><p>Six divine ancestor star beasts, each one at the innate eighth rank just like him, yet he could easily take them down one by one with a single punch.</p><p></p><p>What did "unrivaled at the same realm" even mean? This was the true definition of unrivaled at the same realm.</p><p></p><p>At the same time, a rainbow-colored glow suddenly flashed in the distance.</p><p></p><p>Xia Bingning abruptly exclaimed, "Oh no, it's trying to escape!"</p><p></p><p>Ye Xiao was not flustered at all. With a wave of his right hand, the Great Dragon Instant appeared in his palm.</p><p></p><p>The Sever Heaven Sword Technique was frantically circulating in his meridians, condensing an extremely powerful force.</p><p></p><p>Ye Xiao's gaze radiated two golden lights, as if able to pierce through the ground for millions of meters.</p><p></p><p>Then, as if he had determined a direction, he unleashed a sword strike.</p><p></p><p>In that moment, it was as if the heavens and earth had narrowed down to just this single beam of light. Everything else had disappeared.</p><p></p><p>The sword beam erupted, spreading from the ground to the sky, and then from the sky back to the ground, traversing a massive fan-shaped area and actually cleaving the earth into a chasm tens of thousands of feet deep!</p><p></p><p>Boom! The merciless sword beam swept across Wan Ziqian Ye, accurately bisecting it.</p><p></p><p>Wan Ziqian Ye let out a mournful cry and fell to the ground, unable to move a single inch anymore. It was clear that Ye Xiao's sword strike had completely incapacitated it.</p><p></p><p>Xia Bingning was completely flustered.</p><p></p><p>The rumbling sounds of the earth cracking into a deep ravine continued to echo in her ears, like repeated thunderclaps.</p><p></p><p>And she had fallen into self-doubt about her own life.</p><p></p><p>Was this the power that a mere innate eighth rank cultivator could casually unleash?</p><p></p><p>She was also at the innate eighth rank, so why couldn't she do the same?</p><p></p><p>Ye Xiao retrieved the Wan Ziqian Ye, feeling the extremely dense and pure spiritual energy within it, and couldn't help but sigh, "So this is the Flower King? No wonder it is so revered by so many people - it is truly powerful."</p><p></p><p>After obtaining the Wan Ziqian Ye, he returned to Xia Bingning's side and handed her half of it.</p><p></p><p>"This half is yours."</p><p></p><p>Xia Bingning looked at the flower Ye Xiao was offering for a long time. Although her gaze was reluctant, she ultimately shook her head.</p><p></p><p>"I don't deserve to get this half of the flower."</p><p></p><p>Ye Xiao furrowed his brow slightly. Xia Bingning gave a bitter smile and explained:</p><p></p><p>"Originally, I found you just wanting you to be my assistant, to prevent the Wan Ziqian Ye from escaping. But in the end, the one who became the assistant is me.</p><p></p><p>No, that's not quite right. To be more accurate, I'm not even an assistant. </p><p></p><p>If I were to take this half of the flower, I would truly be ashamed of myself."</p><p></p><p>Ye Xiao replied calmly:</p><p></p><p>"You don't need to be so self-deprecating. If you hadn't told me about the Wan Ziqian Ye, I wouldn't have come here to look for it. And in the beginning, you also killed several star beasts, contributing a lot of effort.</p><p></p><p>Since I've already made a promise to you, I naturally won't go back on my word."</p><p></p><p>"In that case, I can't refuse it." </p><p></p><p>Xia Bingning didn't stubbornly insist on refusing or pushing it back. </p><p></p><p>In fact, she herself was not just putting on an act.</p><p></p><p>Here is the full English translation of the Chinese excerpt:</p><p></p><p>This flower is something I desperately need. Otherwise, I wouldn't have gone to such lengths to come to this place.</p><p></p><p>However, after receiving this half-bloomed flower and storing it in my spatial ring, Xia Bingning's face turned serious as she spoke again:</p><p></p><p>"Before we part, may I ask you a question, Mr. Ye?"</p><p></p><p>"Go ahead," Ye Xiao replied.</p><p></p><p>"Mr. Ye, are you truly a human living on the surface world?"</p><p></p><p>Ye Xiao nodded.</p><p></p><p>"Of course."</p><p></p><p>There was no need to hide his identity, so Ye Xiao did not conceal it.</p><p></p><p>"Sss!" Xia Bingning immediately sucked in a sharp breath.</p><p></p><p>Her veil had fallen off during the previous battle, revealing a stunningly beautiful young face.</p><p></p><p>But now, that beautiful face was filled with exaggerated shock.</p><p></p><p>"Mr. Ye, please forgive my bluntness, but you are truly wasted being here."</p><p></p><p>"What makes you say that?" Ye Xiao's expression remained calm.</p><p></p><p>Xia Bingning spoke seriously, "I can say with full responsibility that your talent and cultivation are far beyond your own imagination. </p><p></p><p>I'm not afraid to tell you that I come from a very powerful place, where the warriors are all extremely strong. If you were to take any of them and place them here, they would be considered geniuses.</p><p></p><p>And even in that place, I am ranked among the top.</p><p></p><p>But when I met you, I felt like I was nothing in comparison.</p><p></p><p>So even if you were there, you would undoubtedly be a brilliant sun that no one could overshadow!"</p><p></p><p>Ye Xiao did not doubt Xia Bingning's words.</p><p></p><p>Her age was not much older than his, yet her cultivation was already on par with his own.</p><p></p><p>Aside from her coming from an even more powerful martial arts civilization, Ye Xiao could not think of any other explanation.</p><p></p><p>He just didn't expect the Heavenly Book Spiritual Consciousness to be so monstrous.</p><p></p><p>Even a genius like Xia Bingning was left in awe of it.</p><p></p><p>Seeing Ye Xiao remain silent, Xia Bingning carefully spoke again, "Mr. Ye, would you be willing to come back with me? You are destined to become a brilliant sun in the sky, and it would be a waste of your talent to remain here."</p><p></p><p>Ye Xiao shook his head. "I'm not interested."</p><p></p><p>Xia Bingning's expression became somewhat regretful.</p><p></p><p>"Mr. Ye, may I ask one more question? Is your real name really Ye Liangchen?"</p><p></p><p>After a moment of silence, Ye Xiao uttered a sentence.</p><p></p><p>"Ye Xiao. That is my true name."</p><p></p><p>Xia Bingning smiled, a radiant smile.</p><p></p><p>"I knew that name wasn't your real one."</p><p></p><p>She wanted to say more, but several extremely powerful auras were approaching from the distance. They were the Saint Sect powerhouses stationed in this area.</p><p></p><p>Sensing these powerful presences approaching, Xia Bingning's expression changed slightly, and she spoke to Ye Xiao with a resigned tone:</p><p></p><p>"Mr. Ye, I'm sorry, but I have to leave first. Although you don't want to come with me now, I believe we will meet again.</p><p></p><p>In the starry sky, I don't think anyone can eclipse your brilliance.</p><p></p><p>I look forward to the day when you unleash your radiance and illuminate the stars.</p><p>Until we meet again."</p><p></p><p>Ye Xiao nodded, and Xia Bingning took her leave, retreating in another direction.</p><p></p><p>He was also not idle, storing the remaining three to four corpses of the Saint Monarch Beasts in his spatial ring, and then turning to leave.</p><p></p><p>All of this happened in an instant. After Ye Xiao left, several figures quickly arrived at the scene.</p><p></p><p>Upon seeing the huge chasm that had been split open, they couldn't help but have their hair stand on end, their souls shaken to the core.</p><p></p><p>"My goodness! Who did this?"</p><p></p><p>"But this trace, the opponent split it open with a single strike!"</p><p></p><p>"How terrifying! When did the Lin Sea area acquire such a powerful expert?"</p><p></p><p>"This person's strength must be at the level of a Saint Monarch Realm!"</p><p></p><p>Of course, Ye Xiao did not possess Saint Monarch Realm strength. It was just that his cultivation was very strong, combined with the enhancement of his cultivation method and his weapon, that resulted in such a powerful display.</p><p></p><p>But it didn't matter, because he could now advance to the Saint Monarch Realm.</p><p></p><p>Earlier in the Jianghai City, he had consumed so much Saint Monarch Beast blood, and his cultivation had already increased significantly.</p><p></p><p>He was not far from reaching the Saint Monarch Realm.</p><p></p><p>Now, with the half-bloomed Myriad Purple Thousand Red Leaf and these few Saint Monarch Beasts, he could directly refine them through alchemy to help himself break through.</p><p></p><p>Originally, he could have revived these few Saint Monarch Beasts and placed them in his cultivation farm for a steady cultivation.</p><p></p><p>But after scanning them, Ye Xiao found that they did not have dragon-level bloodlines, and their blood essence was not thick enough, as they had only been hastened to the Saint Monarch Realm by the Myriad Purple Thousand Red Leaf's own spiritual energy.</p><p></p><p>As such, Ye Xiao had no need to be overly concerned about them.</p><p></p><p>There was another reason as well - the encounter with Xia Bingning.</p><p></p><p>Ye Xiao had previously felt that his cultivation progress was a bit slow, and now, meeting Xia Bingning, he had an even stronger sense of crisis.</p><p></p><p>Even if he was strong enough in the Jianghai City, what about in the Nine Realms? The entire world? And the Starry Sky Battlefield?</p><p></p><p>Therefore, he needed to seize the opportunity and break through to the Saint Monarch Realm through alchemy.</p>

        <h1>Chapter 397</h1>
        <div class="content">
            <p>Here is the full English translation of the Chinese excerpt:</p><p></p><p>That little grass, under the creative divine art of Ye Xiao, gradually transformed into a small flower, just like magic.</p><p></p><p>But Ye Xiao knew that it was not magic, but a real phenomenon.</p><p></p><p>He had truly achieved the transformation of matter!</p><p></p><p>Ye Xiao's heartbeat couldn't help but start to accelerate.</p><p></p><p>This was truly a godly technique! Whether it was the Annihilation Divine Art or the Immortality Divine Art, they were based on destruction and restoration of the existing foundation.</p><p></p><p>Only the Creative Divine Art could thoroughly change the material form and genes. Furthermore, as his own strength continued to increase, the things it could achieve in the future would be even more.</p><p></p><p>It could even create something out of nothing. With a casual grab in the void, he could create whatever he wanted.</p><p></p><p>If there were to be a ranking, the Creative Divine Art would undisputedly be the strongest among his divine arts!</p><p></p><p>Ye Xiao wanted to continue experimenting, to see if he could further evolve this small flower into a living being.</p><p></p><p>He once again unleashed his Creative Divine Art, and the small flower gradually transformed into a small sparrow, but unfortunately, it was a dead sparrow, not a living one.</p><p></p><p>Ye Xiao tried to use the Immortality Divine Art to revive the small sparrow, but failed.</p><p></p><p>It seems that with his current level, he could not fully unleash the power of the Creative Divine Art.</p><p></p><p>Thinking about it carefully, changing matter is not that difficult, but creating a life out of nothing must involve the laws of nature.</p><p></p><p>This was similar to the legendary feats of the goddess NÃ¼wa creating humans in ancient myths.</p><p></p><p>If he, a mere Deicide Realm cultivator, could achieve this level, then the power of the laws of this world would truly be worthless.</p><p></p><p>The path of cultivation is arduous and long!</p><p></p><p>Never mind, since he had already integrated this divine art, he just needed to continue cultivating.</p><p></p><p>It's like building a house - the foundation has already been laid, he just needs to methodically stack the bricks and cement.</p><p></p><p>The house will eventually be built.</p><p></p><p>Next, he should first restore the Great Dragon.</p><p></p><p>And that pill, he should also start refining it.</p><p></p><p>He also wanted to quickly advance his cultivation to the Deicide Realm Second Stage.</p><p></p><p>"When I just used the Creative Divine Art, there were no heavenly changes, so this Creative Divine Art should not cause too much commotion. </p><p></p><p>However, to prevent any potential problems, I should still be cautious and find a hidden place."</p><p></p><p>Thinking this, Ye Xiao instantly disappeared from the spot, reappearing in a small valley.</p><p></p><p>Afterwards, Ye Xiao took out the Great Dragon and began forging it.</p><p></p><p>He took out all the top-grade forging materials he had recently obtained.</p><p></p><p>Ancient Iron Essence, Ten Thousand Year Meteorite Heart - each one was an exceptional top-grade forging material, priceless treasures outside.</p><p></p><p>Even the XuanYuan Clan members and the members of the Hundred Tribes Alliance would covet and desire these. And this was just what Ye Xiao had obtained from two divine king tombs, he couldn't imagine what treasures might be in the Divine Nation's Treasury.</p><p></p><p>Ye Xiao couldn't help but yearn for the Divine Nation's Treasury again. His current progress was already 40%, just a little more and he would be able to excavate the Divine Nation's Treasury.</p><p></p><p>Taking a deep breath to calm himself, Ye Xiao formally began forging the Great Dragon.</p><p></p><p>He gently caressed the Great Dragon's body and comforted it:</p><p></p><p>"This forging may take a long time, and you may suffer greatly. Persevere! After this, your strength will rise to a whole new level, possibly a hundred times stronger than before."</p><p></p><p>The Great Dragon seemed to understand his words and let out a dragon's roar in response.</p><p></p><p>Receiving the response, Ye Xiao slowly unleashed the Creative Divine Art, worried that the power was too strong for the Great Dragon's spirit to withstand.</p><p></p><p>Finding materials for forging weapons was easy, but finding a suitable spirit was difficult.</p><p></p><p>The spirit he had cultivated was too weak, unable to wield such a powerful weapon, unable to be in harmony with the weapon's true body! As the Creative Divine Art deepened, Ye Xiao could clearly feel the Great Dragon's spirit trembling.</p><p></p><p>This power, capable of transforming the very structure of matter, was truly terrifying. The Great Dragon could not resist, only submitting under the might of his divine art.</p><p></p><p>Ye Xiao took out some Starbeast Essence Blood from his storage ring, which he had extracted from the starbeasts in the underground lair earlier.</p><p></p><p>This Starbeast Essence Blood was extremely powerful, able to strengthen the Great Dragon's spirit.</p><p></p><p>The Starbeast Essence Blood seeped into the weapon, being absorbed by the Great Dragon, quickly enhancing the power of its spiritual body. Its trembling spirit gradually calmed down.</p><p></p><p>Then, Ye Xiao began to add even stronger material substances.</p><p></p><p>When the material substances were elevated to a certain degree, accompanied by the increased power of the Creative Divine Art, the Great Dragon's spirit would tremble again, and Ye Xiao would pour in some more Starbeast Essence Blood.</p><p></p><p>Repeating this cycle continuously, the Great Dragon's power...</p><p></p><p>Here is the full English translation of the Chinese excerpt:</p><p></p><p>The spirit of the weapon was also constantly becoming stronger.</p><p></p><p>It was not just the weapon spirit, but the weapon itself that was continuously improving.</p><p></p><p>What made Ye Xiao feel delighted was that there was no thunder tribulation appearing in the sky above.</p><p></p><p>This was a good phenomenon, because in this way, he would not be discovered by others.</p><p></p><p>However, what he did not know was that at this moment, within the entire human realm, even including the weapons in the hands of the various tribes in the starry sky, they all began to tremble slightly and emit a series of trembling cries.</p><p></p><p>"What's going on?"</p><p></p><p>"Why did my weapon start trembling?"</p><p></p><p>"My weapon also started trembling."</p><p></p><p>"Is there something wrong? Why does it seem to be afraid of something? It's a divine weapon!"</p><p></p><p>"Fuck, what the hell is happening?"</p><p></p><p>In the mortal world, those great masters had just fallen asleep, but suddenly heard the commotion in the courtyard and came out of their respective rooms.</p><p></p><p>When they saw Ning Zhiyuan, they went forward and asked, "Young Master Ning, what happened? Why are you all making a commotion in the courtyard so late at night?"</p><p></p><p>Ning Zhiyuan immediately responded:</p><p></p><p>"Masters, just now, for some unknown reason, the weapons in our hands all started trembling. Is there some kind of danger approaching?"</p><p></p><p>"What did you say? The weapons started trembling?"</p><p></p><p>Master Fu Long and the other few weapon refiners' expressions suddenly changed, and then they became solemn.</p><p></p><p>"Let me see!"</p><p></p><p>Master Fu Long snatched the divine long sword from Ning Zhiyuan's hand, glanced at it, then bit his two fingers and squeezed out a drop of essence blood.</p><p></p><p>"Settle!"</p><p></p><p>He printed that drop of essence blood on the divine long sword, but the divine long sword did not calm down as he had imagined, but continued to tremble. Even more, it began to bend, wanting to kneel towards a certain direction.</p><p></p><p>"It's as I thought!"</p><p></p><p>Master Fu Long's eyes shone with excitement, and the other masters were also excited.</p><p></p><p>"I can't believe this is actually true! We've always thought it was just a legend, but today we actually witnessed this kind of thing."</p><p></p><p>"Extraordinary, this is truly extraordinary!"</p><p></p><p>Ning Zhiyuan was somewhat puzzled, frowning slightly, and couldn't help but ask again, "Masters, what does this represent?"</p><p></p><p>Master Fu Long patted his chest to calm down the excitement in his heart.</p><p></p><p>"In our world of weapon refiners, there is an ancient legend. When all the weapons start trembling, it means that a precious treasure is about to be born!"</p><p></p><p>"What did you say?" Ning Zhiyuan's pupils suddenly shrank.</p><p></p><p>Although he didn't know why these weapons were trembling and bowing, he had definitely heard of precious treasures before.</p><p></p><p>The Xuanyuan Clan had a precious treasure! The Xuanyuan Divine Sword!</p><p></p><p>The ancient ancestor of the Xuanyuan Clan had left behind this clan treasure. Precious treasures are powerful existences that can amplify divine arts.</p><p></p><p>Even the best nine-star divine weapons cannot withstand the repeated casting of divine arts, let alone unleashing divine arts to the extreme.</p><p></p><p>But with a precious treasure, one can achieve this.</p><p></p><p>To put it simply, in the same case of having divine arts and reaching the realm of divine emperor, possessing a precious treasure would basically give one a great advantage.</p><p></p><p>So the preciousness of a precious treasure is self-evident.</p><p></p><p>"Then the direction they are bowing towards must be the location of that precious treasure, right?"</p><p></p><p>"Young Master Ning is correct."</p><p></p><p>"Let's go!"</p><p></p><p>Without any hesitation, Ning Zhiyuan immediately unleashed his movement technique and rushed towards that direction.</p><p></p><p>The other weapon refiners, as well as the experts of the Ning Clan, immediately followed.</p><p></p><p>At this moment, Ye Xiao had already successfully forged the Great Dragon.</p><p></p><p>Looking at the brand-new Great Dragon, which was releasing an unprecedented powerful and terrifying aura, Ye Xiao was very satisfied.</p><p></p><p>He tapped on the weapon, and the Great Dragon emitted a crisp trembling response. The surface of the weapon was as smooth as a mirror, and one could clearly see a giant dragon excitedly roaming inside.</p><p></p><p>It was evident that the dragon spirit of the Great Dragon had grown even larger than before.</p><p></p><p>Ye Xiao smiled.</p><p></p><p>"You seem to really like this new home. I just wonder what level you are now? How strong is your strength?"</p><p></p><p>Just as he finished saying this, Ye Xiao suddenly frowned.</p><p></p><p>He felt that from all directions, many auras were flying towards this place.</p><p></p><p>"This is really strange, I didn't even cause any thunder tribulation, so why are so many people being attracted here?"</p><p></p><p>But after a moment, he shook his head and turned to leave.</p><p></p><p>No matter what it was, it had nothing to do with him. He only wanted to cultivate peacefully, and he didn't want others to discover the secrets about him.</p><p></p><p>(This chapter ends)</p>

        <h1>Chapter 251</h1>
        <div class="content">
            <p>Here is the full English translation of the Chinese excerpt:</p><p></p><p>"Liu Chengxun? Is he very powerful?"</p><p></p><p>Li Liushui raised his eyebrows slightly. </p><p></p><p>He was different from Lu Qingshan, who was somewhat interested in and had a basic understanding of many new things.</p><p></p><p>But he was a complete martial arts fanatic. Apart from cultivation, he did not have a deep understanding of other matters in this world.</p><p></p><p>Fa Zheng was silent for a moment.</p><p></p><p>Because he did not know how to explain it.</p><p></p><p>Liu Chengxun was indeed very strong, much stronger than him. But in front of Li Liushui, he seemed to be nothing. For a moment, he did not know what words to use to describe it.</p><p></p><p>Beside him, the Buddhist disciple Aro explained:</p><p></p><p>"Liu Chengxun has been famous in recent decades, he is the renowned Sword Saint of Hanzhou, a Shenzong-level expert of the innate eighth rank.</p><p></p><p>He was previously ranked 49th on the World Dragon Ranking, but now he has fallen to the 50th position.</p><p></p><p>Because he was defeated by Senior Sword Immortal, and Senior Sword Immortal didn't even appear, he just hid his sword intent in a rose and easily defeated him."</p><p></p><p>"Oh~!"</p><p></p><p>Li Liushui lightly exclaimed, not taking it seriously.</p><p></p><p>If Liu Chengxun was of the innate ninth rank, he would have paid a little more attention to him.</p><p></p><p>But unfortunately, he was not even of the innate ninth rank. Since that was the case, he had nothing to be concerned about.</p><p></p><p>The innate ninth rank, even if it was just a little bit inferior, he would not bother to look at it.</p><p></p><p>Let alone the huge gap between the innate eighth rank and the innate ninth rank.</p><p></p><p>His gaze fell on the statue of the Sword Immortal again, murmuring:</p><p></p><p>"But, to be honest, this Sword Immortal does have some abilities. To be able to condense his sword intent into a rose, I'm becoming more and more interested in him."</p><p></p><p>Li Liushui spoke indifferently.</p><p></p><p>In fact, after reaching his level of cultivation, he could easily analyze the opponent's strength from some side events. Concealing the sword intent in a flower should be at the peak of the innate ninth rank. When he was at the peak of the innate ninth rank, he could also easily do that.</p><p></p><p>So there was nothing extraordinary about it.</p><p></p><p>However, among the Nine Provinces, there were not many who could reach the Shenzong peak.</p><p></p><p>So he was still a little curious and wanted to see who the opponent was.</p><p></p><p>But in fact, although his analysis was mostly correct, there was still a slight difference. He did not fully analyze certain aspects.</p><p></p><p>First, Ye Xiao's cultivation at the time was at the innate eighth rank. It's just that he was unrivaled at the same level, so he could fight one rank above, which was roughly equivalent to the innate ninth rank.</p><p></p><p>In this regard, Li Liushui's analysis was also quite close.</p><p></p><p>But in the second aspect, he failed to analyze.</p><p></p><p>That is, Ye Xiao's talent! Ye Xiao has already become a King Realm expert, but he could not analyze this.</p><p></p><p>"Senior Li, let's go inside and select some Buddhist scriptures for you."</p><p></p><p>Li Liushui nodded.</p><p></p><p>He could not easily suppress the demonic nature within him, so he needed some Buddhist scriptures to help suppress the demonic nature and the urge to kill.</p><p></p><p>The three of them walked into the library and went straight to the fourth floor.</p><p></p><p>Li Liushui was slightly puzzled.</p><p></p><p>"Why not on other floors? But on this floor? Just now on the third floor, I also saw some Buddhist scriptures."</p><p></p><p>Fa Zheng smiled.</p><p></p><p>"It's true that there are some Buddhist scriptures sent by Shaolin on the third floor, but there are even more on the floors above.</p><p></p><p>And on the fourth floor, there is a good friend of the disciple, so the disciple also wants to find him."</p><p></p><p>"I see."</p><p></p><p>The three of them came to Ye Xiao's side and saw Ye Xiao and Liu Chengxun chatting.</p><p></p><p>"Ye Shishi."</p><p></p><p>Ye Xiao was suddenly interrupted and looked at the other party. Liu Chengxun also raised his eyebrows slightly.</p><p></p><p>However, when he saw Fa Zheng and Aro, it was still fine, but when he saw Li Liushui behind Fa Zheng, he immediately trembled, his pupils contracted, and he couldn't even say a word.</p><p></p><p>This... This... This was something Fa Zheng didn't notice. His gaze was focused on Ye Xiao the whole time.</p><p></p><p>"Master, why do you have time to come over today?"</p><p></p><p>Ye Xiao could immediately see Li Liushui's level.</p><p></p><p>At the peak of the innate ninth rank, above the Great Perfection, and half a step into the King Realm! Judging from his appearance, he should have just recently tried to break through but failed.</p><p></p><p>Among the Nine Provinces, there should not be more than two people at this level. Combined with the faint demonic aura within him and Fa Zheng accompanying him, it was almost certain.</p><p></p><p>Sword Immortal Li Liushui!</p><p></p><p>"The poor monk just saw the personnel announcement board downstairs and saw that Ye Shishi has been promoted, so the poor monk came to congratulate Ye Shishi."</p><p></p><p>"Thank you."</p><p></p><p>"Oh yes, the storage ring that the poor monk left for Ye Shishi..."</p><p></p><p>"I didn't take that storage ring because I went to Zhongzhou for a month of further study, and I just came back a few days ago. So it's still with Headmaster Ouyang."</p><p></p><p>"I see, then the poor monk will go find her now and take my leave."</p><p></p><p>Ye Xiao nodded, and Fa Zheng left with Li Liushui, while Aro did not leave and started looking for books to study in this area.</p><p></p><p>"Hello, I'm looking for some books related to the language of the Nine Provinces to study."</p><p></p><p>Here is the full English translation of the Chinese excerpt:</p><p></p><p>"Where can I find the Nine States language?" </p><p></p><p>Aro asked in fluent Hawk language, mixed with not-so-proficient Nine States language, while also gesturing.</p><p></p><p>Ye Xiao: "(_..)!"</p><p>Liu Chengxun: "(_..)!"</p><p></p><p>"Old Liu, don't you know bird language?"</p><p></p><p>"I never learned it, and it's not useful for me anyway. I was born in the Nine States and later went to Hanzhou."</p><p></p><p>Ye Xiao tried to scan the other party's mind with spiritual power, and then he understood that Aro wanted to learn the Nine States language.</p><p></p><p>"Is he trying to learn the Nine States language? Have your people pick out a few Nine States language introductory books for him."</p><p></p><p>"Okay!"</p><p></p><p>Liu Chengxun called out to a nearby small administrator, and under Liu Chengxun's order, the administrator led Aro to find the books.</p><p></p><p>Seeing Aro's devout expression, Liu Chengxun couldn't help but sigh:</p><p></p><p>"Everyone who comes to the Nine States will be attracted by its culture. This Aro, there's an 80% chance that he won't be able to leave the Nine States in the future. Didn't you see? His eyes were shining when he was talking about the Nine States language."</p><p></p><p>"Doesn't he have a visa? After the visa expires, won't he have to go back?"</p><p></p><p>"Judging from his appearance, he should be preparing to learn the Nine States language and then take the exam to join the Nine States. With his innate sixth-grade high-level martial artist talent, it won't be difficult for him to join the Nine States.</p><p></p><p>After this beast disaster is over, I may also consider joining the Nine States.</p><p></p><p>But not now. After all, Hanzhou has nurtured me for so many years, and with the beast disaster approaching, I can't leave Hanzhou now, at least not until I help them get through this beast disaster.</p><p></p><p>Otherwise, without the Divine Ancestor guarding, Hanzhou will probably be completely destroyed."</p><p></p><p>Ye Xiao nodded.</p><p></p><p>So many people joining the Nine States, and they are all geniuses, which is a good thing for the Nine States.</p><p></p><p>It can make the Nine States stronger and stronger.</p><p></p><p>Of course, if they are trash, they absolutely won't be accepted.</p><p></p><p>The Nine States is not a garbage dump.</p><p></p><p>"By the way, did you notice the person next to Fa Zheng just now?"</p><p></p><p>"That silent old man?"</p><p></p><p>"Yes, him!"</p><p></p><p>Liu Chengxun's expression suddenly became solemn.</p><p></p><p>"That guy is no ordinary person. His aura, even I can feel its terrifying power.</p><p></p><p>You may not know that feeling, because your cultivation is too weak. You only have the strength of an innate sixth-grade martial artist. In front of him, you're like a tiny ant in the wilderness, unable to see how tall and mighty the mountain is! Only true powerhouses can feel his overwhelming strength and terror.</p><p></p><p>I've heard recently that the Sword Saint of the Nine States, Li Liushui, failed his breakthrough and went into seclusion in Shaolin. He's with Fa Zheng, and it's very likely that he came here to find Senior Sword Immortal, because Senior Sword Immortal also cultivates sword techniques, and may be able to give him some insights."</p><p></p><p>"Oh!"</p><p></p><p>Ye Xiao responded with a casual "Oh".</p><p></p><p>Liu Chengxun continued:</p><p></p><p>"Unexpectedly, I, Liu Chengxun, will have the honor of seeing the Sword Saint Li Liushui one day. He is a super existence ranked ninth on the Dragon Ranking, after all."</p><p></p><p>"Aren't you also on the Dragon Ranking?"</p><p></p><p>"It's not the same."</p><p></p><p>Liu Chengxun shook his head.</p><p></p><p>"Although we are both on the Dragon Ranking, the gap in power between the rankings is vast.</p><p></p><p>The higher you go, the greater the gap in strength. </p><p></p><p>My cultivation is very strong, but I'm only ranked 50th. If it's someone around 40th like Lang Xingyue or Shi Guanghao, they could easily defeat me.</p><p></p><p>And those ranked 30th can defeat them even more easily.</p><p></p><p>The top 20 can crush me as easily as squeezing an ant.</p><p></p><p>Not to mention Li Liushui, who is ranked 9th on the Dragon Ranking.</p><p></p><p>In front of him, even I, a Divine Ancestor, have to be humble.</p><p></p><p>He is the true top-tier powerhouse of this world."</p><p></p><p>This was something Ye Xiao agreed with.</p><p></p><p>Previously, when he exchanged ideas with Beitang Ce at the Central State Library, Beitang Ce had told him that among the current world Dragon Ranking, only the top seven were Monarch Realm experts.</p><p></p><p>In the Phoenix Ranking, only four were Monarch Realm experts.</p><p></p><p>Now including himself, there were only about twelve Monarch Realm experts in the world.</p><p></p><p>And this was on a global scale. If it was just within the Nine States, there would be even fewer.</p><p></p><p>The Nine States had four Monarch Realm experts, two men and two women, each occupying the top two positions on the Dragon and Phoenix Rankings.</p><p></p><p>Apart from them, there was one more female Monarch Realm expert, but she had been in seclusion for many years.</p><p></p><p>But there were no experts above the Monarch Realm in the world, only in the Starry Sky Battlefield.</p><p></p><p>From this perspective, below the Monarch Realm, the Half-step Monarch Realm was the strongest.</p><p></p><p>The Sword Saint Li Liushui could be considered one of the top twenty male and female experts in the world.</p><p></p><p>Among billions of people, being in the top twenty truly made him a top-tier powerhouse!</p>

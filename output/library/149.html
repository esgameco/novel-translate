        <h1>Chapter 149</h1>
        <div class="content">
            <p>Here is the full English translation of the Chinese excerpt:</p><p></p><p>The first to arrive was naturally Dou Changfeng. He was a grand master, currently in Jianghai City. Apart from Ye Xiao and Fa Zheng, he could be considered one of the highest-level figures.</p><p></p><p>When Dou Changfeng saw this palm technique, he was completely stunned.</p><p></p><p>"Such a powerful palm technique! Its strength is absolutely beyond that of the grand masters."</p><p></p><p>If this palm strike had landed on any other surface, Dou Changfeng would not have been so shocked, but it struck the city road in Jianghai City.</p><p></p><p>The construction materials in this world were many times stronger than the ones from Ye Xiao's previous life. </p><p></p><p>To be able to create a three-meter-deep palm print that was so neatly fractured on this road, Dou Changfeng knew that he himself would not be able to accomplish this easily.</p><p></p><p>"Wait a minute, could it be that this palm strike was done by that senior? After all, in Jianghai City, only that senior would have such cultivation."</p><p></p><p>But at this moment, Fa Zheng's voice came from behind.</p><p></p><p>"Amitabha, that shouldn't be possible, right? Could it be that senior has also cultivated a palm technique? That would be too heaven-defying!"</p><p></p><p>Dou Changfeng turned around and greeted him.</p><p></p><p>"Master Fa Zheng."</p><p></p><p>Then he spoke again:</p><p></p><p>"Senior Sword Immortal has already mastered sword and saber techniques, as well as healing arts, and may even know array formations. Now to add a palm technique on top of that, this is simply impossible!"</p><p></p><p>Fa Zheng smiled.</p><p></p><p>"If it were Senior Sword Immortal, he would have no need to use a palm technique, as he could simply use the saber and sword techniques he is accustomed to. Why would he use a palm technique he has never used before?"</p><p></p><p>In reality, what Fa Zheng did not know was that Ye Xiao used the palm technique purely to avoid damaging the ingredients. </p><p></p><p>Additionally, Ye Xiao had just learned the Tathagata Divine Palm and had not yet had a chance to demonstrate its power.</p><p></p><p>Dou Changfeng pondered Fa Zheng's words for a moment.</p><p></p><p>"I can't say for sure, but for now, Senior Sword Immortal is the most likely candidate in Jianghai City."</p><p></p><p>Fa Zheng smiled and walked forward, but the moment he saw the palm technique, his pupils constricted, his eyes widened, and his whole body started to tremble.</p><p></p><p>"This, this... how is this possible?"</p><p></p><p>Dou Changfeng was puzzled.</p><p></p><p>"Master Fa Zheng, do you recognize this palm technique?"</p><p></p><p>Fa Zheng nodded, his face filled with excitement.</p><p></p><p>"I can now determine that this palm technique definitely does not belong to Senior Sword Immortal!"</p><p></p><p>"How can you tell?"</p><p></p><p>"Professor Dou, after studying martial arts for so many years at Kyoto University, have you ever heard that the Shaolin possess a palm technique that descended from the heavens?"</p><p></p><p>Dou Changfeng's entire body broke out in goosebumps.</p><p></p><p>"You don't mean... the Tathagata Divine Palm, the most powerful palm technique that has been lost for centuries?"</p><p></p><p>"Exactly, the Tathagata Divine Palm!"</p><p></p><p>"Heavens!" </p><p></p><p>Dou Changfeng was utterly shocked. If that was the case, it could not possibly be Senior Sword Immortal.</p><p></p><p>No matter how powerful Senior Sword Immortal was, he could not have possibly obtained this Shaolin palm technique that had been lost for centuries.</p><p></p><p>Only a supreme Shaolin monk who had inherited this legacy could have displayed this palm technique.</p><p></p><p>But the question was, where did this supreme Shaolin monk come from, and why had they all gathered in Jianghai City?</p><p></p><p>Regardless of their shock, Ye Xiao had already brought Jifeng's corpse back home.</p><p></p><p>"Huan Liuli, come out."</p><p></p><p>Huan Liuli quickly ran out of the room.</p><p></p><p>"I'm here, I'm here, Master has returned."</p><p></p><p>Ye Xiao tossed the storage ring containing Jifeng's corpse out, and Huan Liuli first paused, then her eyes widened with excitement. "This, this is another Saint Beast-level star beast?"</p><p></p><p>Ye Xiao nodded.</p><p></p><p>"Bring out the roasting rack we used for the mutton skewers, to roast chicken wings and drumsticks. Also, get the big iron pot and stove to make a stew."</p><p></p><p>"Got it, right away!" </p><p></p><p>Huan Liuli excitedly rushed into the house to bring out the items. </p><p></p><p>This was too exciting - another Saint Beast-level star beast corpse had been obtained. At this rate, her cultivation would likely rise again before long, haha.</p><p></p><p>Okay, considering all these Saint Beast star beasts, she would be willing to serve Ye Xiao for a hundred more years, starting with nine hundred years of servitude! After she brought out the items, Ye Xiao immediately chopped off the chicken claws, severed Jifeng's wings and legs, and removed the chicken liver and heart.</p><p></p><p>But Ye Xiao did not continue. Instead, he used the Heavenly Restoration Technique to start repairing and reviving Jifeng.</p><p></p><p>Huan Liuli cooperatively plucked the feathers from the already severed chicken wings and drumsticks.</p><p></p><p>As Ye Xiao's star pet, she understood his intentions - to use the Heavenly Restoration Technique to revive and repair Jifeng, and then continue to chop off the chicken wings and legs. </p><p></p><p>This way, they could obtain a large quantity of chicken wings and drumsticks from a single mother chicken, maximizing resource utilization.</p><p></p><p>This was also the reason Ye Xiao had used the Tathagata Divine Palm - it could directly suffocate Jifeng without damaging the spirit core or soul, allowing the Heavenly Restoration Technique to be used.</p><p></p><p>The Heavenly Restoration Technique could only be used on living beings with a soul.</p><p></p><p>Here is the full English translation of the Chinese excerpt:</p><p></p><p>The tentacles of Noelfis cannot be used with the Heavenly Restoration Art, as there is no spiritual power within the tentacles.</p><p></p><p>In order to use the Heavenly Restoration Art to summon out many of Noelfis' octopus tentacles, one can only cast it on his main body or his detached parts.</p><p></p><p>This characteristic of the Healing Art is also very understandable.</p><p></p><p>If the Healing Art did not have the prerequisite of the soul, not to mention being able to randomly revive everything, perhaps even shattered stones could be revived.</p><p></p><p>That would be a bit too monstrous.</p><p></p><p>However, Ye Xiao also had a guess that if his three Healing Arts could be fused in the future, the new Healing Art created might be able to revive these dead objects, disregarding such rules.</p><p></p><p>The Heavenly Restoration Art continuously absorbed the spiritual energy of heaven and earth, and quickly revived Ji Feng.</p><p></p><p>Ji Feng looked around at Ye Xiao with a confused expression on her face.</p><p></p><p>"Strange, didn't I already die? How am I still alive?"</p><p></p><p>The next moment, Ye Xiao let her know why she was still alive.</p><p></p><p>A miserable chicken cry rang out to the heavens.</p><p></p><p>Ye Xiao once again severed her wings and legs.</p><p></p><p>The workers on the distant construction site did not find anything strange.</p><p></p><p>After all, this agonizing cry came from a chicken, not a human.</p><p></p><p>Ye Xiao repeated this cycle over and over, cutting off hundreds of pairs of Ji Feng's chicken wings and legs.</p><p></p><p>Ji Feng's entire chicken body had become completely numb.</p><p></p><p>Even though she had been imprisoned by humans for fifty-six years before being released, she had never felt as desperate as she did today.</p><p></p><p>This Ye Xiao was simply a devil.</p><p></p><p>No, even a devil wouldn't be this cruel!</p><p></p><p>He was a complete psychopath, he was definitely not human!</p><p></p><p>"You sick pervert, are you ill?" Ji Feng cursed.</p><p></p><p>Ye Xiao ignored her, only continuing his actions.</p><p></p><p>Come on, he was just killing a chicken, what was so perverted about killing a chicken?</p><p></p><p>Seeing that Ye Xiao was unmoved, Ji Feng sneered, "You're ruthless, old lady has fallen into your hands today, but don't be too proud of yourself. I'll tell you, my fellow star beasts will definitely avenge me. They are all Celestial Venerable level star beasts. Once they rescue Senior Noelfis, with his Celestial Venerable peak strength, he will definitely kill you and tear you to pieces!"</p><p></p><p>But she didn't know that just as she finished saying these words, Ye Xiao's eyes suddenly lit up.</p><p></p><p>So this Ji Feng had accomplices? Well, well, they were all Celestial Venerables? He exchanged a glance with Illusion Jade Pearl, and she immediately handed him a freshly roasted chicken wing.</p><p></p><p>"Master, you should rest for a bit and eat a couple of wings to replenish your strength."</p><p></p><p>Ye Xiao nodded, tossed the severed-legged and winged Ji Feng aside, and for the time being did not bother with her, and began enjoying the chicken wings with Illusion Jade Pearl. But he discreetly sent a thread of spiritual power into Ji Feng's body.</p><p></p><p>With this thread of spiritual power, no matter where Ji Feng fled, he would be able to find her.</p><p></p><p>Ji Feng had been so thoroughly tormented by Ye Xiao that she was already numb, and never thought that Ye Xiao and Illusion Jade Pearl's intentions were actually different. She thought her chance had come.</p><p></p><p>She immediately mobilized the spiritual energy within her body to quickly repair her body. Although her Healing Art was far inferior to Ye Xiao's, restoring her legs was still not a problem.</p><p></p><p>After recovering her legs, she took the opportunity while Ye Xiao and his servant were not paying attention, and fled as a beam of light.</p><p></p><p>"Haha, you foolish human race, you were too careless. Wait and see, one day I will come back to settle this score with you."</p><p></p><p>Illusion Jade Pearl handed Ye Xiao another chicken leg, and the master and servant exchanged a smile.</p><p></p><p>"It seems we'll be able to enjoy some new delicacies soon."</p><p></p><p>"Master is truly wise, casting a long line to catch the big fish is much more impressive than waiting for the star beasts to come to us. But speaking of which, we've already stockpiled so many chicken wings and legs, we won't lack for food in the short term."</p><p></p><p>Ye Xiao nodded, but looking at the yard full of chicken wings and legs, he couldn't help but frown.</p><p></p><p>With so many things, even if stored in the storage ring, they would probably take up a large portion of the space.</p><p></p><p>It seems he still needs to expand the space of the storage ring.</p><p></p><p>After finishing the chicken wings, the master and servant duo had also gained a large amount of qi and blood, and their internal strength was rapidly rising.</p><p></p><p>Ye Xiao felt that his current cultivation was about three-tenths away from reaching the Innate Eighth Rank.</p><p></p><p>It seems eating star beasts is really much faster.</p><p></p><p>After the meal, Ye Xiao dialed Wang Dailong's phone number.</p><p></p><p>"Hello, Boss Wang, I want to order a few more truckloads of black obsidian, do you still have any in stock?"</p><p></p><p>"Yes, but not much, at most I can find two truckloads for you. The Seven Stars Converge just passed, and the transportation in various places has not fully recovered to its previous state. Now if you want to buy this kind of not-so-hot-selling item, you have to go to the big cities."</p><p></p><p>Ye Xiao pondered for a moment, two truckloads should be able to help him expand the storage ring by another fold, although not a lot, but still better than nothing.</p><p></p><p>Three updates, nine thousand.</p><p></p><p>Please subscribe, recommend, vote, and comment!</p><p></p><p>(Chapter end)</p>

        <h1>Chapter 203</h1>
        <div class="content">
            <p>Here is the full English translation of the Chinese excerpt:</p><p></p><p>"Could it be him?"</p><p></p><p>"Dragon Slayer? Who is that?" </p><p></p><p>Many young people in the crowd couldn't help but ask in confusion.</p><p></p><p>They didn't know who this Dragon Slayer was.</p><p></p><p>Dou Changfeng's face was extremely grave as he introduced: "Dragon Slayer was a powerful figure from our parents' generation, so it's normal that you don't know him.</p><p></p><p>He was the former leader of the Beast God Alliance, about three leaders before the current one. </p><p></p><p>As you all know, the Beast God Alliance has been suppressed by the Nine Provinces Alliance and is now like a stray dog on the street.</p><p></p><p>But even in that state, the Beast God Alliance is still a force that ordinary people cannot underestimate.</p><p></p><p>During the years when Dragon Slayer was the leader, the Beast God Alliance even put considerable pressure on the Nine Provinces Alliance.</p><p></p><p>Back then, the beastmen were a hundred times more rampant than they are now, even daring to appear openly in human cities."</p><p></p><p>"Whew!" </p><p></p><p>Hearing this, everyone couldn't help but feel a chill. After all, being a stray dog on the street and walking around brazenly are two completely different concepts, like two different dimensions. </p><p></p><p>That represents identity and strength! Even now, when talking about the Beast God Alliance, people still reveal a hint of fear on their faces.</p><p></p><p>But unexpectedly, the Beast God Alliance actually had such a powerful history.</p><p></p><p>During the years when Dragon Slayer was the leader of the Beast God Alliance, just how much stronger must it have been compared to now to reach this level?</p><p></p><p>"But couldn't anyone suppress Dragon Slayer? Don't we have many Dragon Ranking experts in the Nine Provinces? They are all Saint Realm masters, so couldn't they match him?"</p><p></p><p>Some young people were still very puzzled.</p><p></p><p>No matter how strong Dragon Slayer was, he couldn't possibly be a match for the Dragon Ranking experts, right?</p><p></p><p>After all, the Dragon Ranking was the top dozens of experts in the entire world!</p><p></p><p>Fa Zheng shook his head and sighed deeply.</p><p></p><p>"Dragon Ranking experts? Why didn't they act?</p><p></p><p>At the time, the one ranked 35th on the World Dragon Ranking, Jiang Lingyun! The one ranked 41st on the World Phoenix Ranking, Xun Qingwu, were all defeated by him.</p><p></p><p>In the end, it was the Sword Saint Li Liushui who finally defeated him and forced him to retreat to the Heavenly Demon Cliff, not allowing him to come out again."</p><p></p><p>As these words were spoken, the entire venue fell completely silent.</p><p></p><p>Everyone's eyes revealed a hint of fear.</p><p></p><p>Dragon Slayer was actually so powerful? Even the experts of the Dragon and Phoenix Rankings were not his match? In the end, it was the Sword Saint Li Liushui who finally defeated him.</p><p></p><p>The crowd felt that their brain capacity could no longer bear this earth-shattering news.</p><p></p><p>At this moment, the dark clouds had already arrived above Jianghai City, and the city's alarm had already sounded.</p><p></p><p>The dark clouds carried an almost overwhelming power, causing all the living beings in Jianghai City to tremble.</p><p></p><p>Dou Changfeng immediately spoke:</p><p></p><p>"The beastmen should enter Jianghai City soon, have the defense team and the senior students of the Jianghai Martial Arts Academy set up a defense line on the east side to prevent the beastmen from entering Jianghai City!"</p><p></p><p>The surrounding students were already eager and impatient.</p><p></p><p>Although Dragon Slayer was strong, Jianghai City was their homeland, and no matter how strong the enemy was, they had to defend their home.</p><p></p><p>Dou Changfeng quickly arranged for the school's teachers to lead the team to support the defense team, and Fa Zheng also hurried to the front line.</p><p></p><p>Then he turned to Aluo and the others and said:</p><p></p><p>"Mr. Aluo, you are the friends of Tianzhu, you don't need to participate in our city's defense battle, please leave quickly from the west."</p><p></p><p>But Aluo shook his head.</p><p></p><p>"We are also human martial artists, we can lend a hand. If we really can't hold out, we can leave later."</p><p></p><p>"Then thank you."</p><p></p><p>Everyone rushed to the east, building a defensive line on the east side of Jianghai City.</p><p></p><p>In the distance, smoke and haze soon appeared in the human's line of sight.</p><p></p><p>The ground was trembling, and countless dark shadows were rushing from the darkness.</p><p></p><p>The oppressive feeling of a massive army approaching made everyone's hearts race, and their minds even produced some cicada sounds due to the excessive tension!</p><p></p><p>"The beastmen are here."</p><p></p><p>Someone couldn't help but shout.</p><p></p><p>The others had also seen the beastmen army.</p><p></p><p>Countless figures that were almost evolved into star beasts were shuttling through the army, and some were still in human form, not yet fully transformed into star beasts.</p><p></p><p>"Gulp!"</p><p></p><p>Many people swallowed hard, facing this powerful impact, they were obviously having some difficulty adapting.</p><p></p><p>Dou Changfeng immediately shouted loudly:</p><p></p><p>"Don't directly confront their charge, the physique of the beastmen is stronger than ours. Frontal assault will be more advantageous for them.</p><p></p><p>Open a gap in the defense line, wait for them to rush in, and then attack from both sides to avoid their spearhead."</p><p></p><p>As a former professor at the Jingzhou Martial Arts Academy, Dou Changfeng's research on tactics was much stronger than these people.</p><p></p><p>Under his command, the defense line immediately opened a huge gap. The beastmen army, due to their overwhelming numbers, could not easily change direction and charged directly into the line. The two sides attacked from both sides, causing heavy casualties on the spot.</p><p></p><p>Here is the full English translation of the Chinese excerpt:</p><p></p><p>However, this was only a stopgap measure, which could only be used to resolve the first wave of the beastmen's charge, but could not solve all the beastmen.</p><p></p><p>Soon, the beastmen behind charged up and joined the battle at high speed, and the battle directly entered a stalemate.</p><p></p><p>In the sky, Dragon Slayer stood among the clouds.</p><p></p><p>At this time, he was no longer the old man in the black robe at the foot of the Demon Cliff, but a heroic league leader wearing a dragon scale robe.</p><p></p><p>He had his hands behind his back, his gaze sweeping lightly below, with a hint of murderous intent in his eyes.</p><p></p><p>But he did not make a move.</p><p></p><p>If he were to make a move, not only the beastmen and other human tribes currently engaged in fierce battle below, even the entire Jianghai City would be difficult to escape annihilation.</p><p></p><p>After reaching such a realm of cultivation, he was no longer interested in the ants below.</p><p></p><p>Even the Sword Immortal, he did not have much expectation for.</p><p></p><p>The reason he came to Jianghai City, to find the Sword Immortal, was merely to announce one thing to the world.</p><p></p><p>That is, he, Dragon Slayer, has returned!</p><p></p><p>All these years, he has been madly cultivating at the foot of the Demon Cliff, decades of torment and suffering, just to defeat the Sword God Li Liushui, to tell the Nine Provinces Alliance that there is no one in this world who has the qualifications to suppress him! Only he, Dragon Slayer, can subdue everything in this world! But just like a company's grand opening, there must be firecrackers, slaughtering pigs and sheep, to announce it.</p><p></p><p>The Sword Immortal is his pig and sheep, and Jianghai City is his firecracker.</p><p></p><p>Since he has returned to the rivers and lakes of the Nine Provinces, he must fire a shot to shock the entire Nine Provinces, the entire world.</p><p></p><p>Even his gaze did not look towards the battle below, nor towards Jianghai City, but only towards the direction of the Extreme North Glacier in the north of the Nine Provinces.</p><p></p><p>"Li Liushui, it's been seventy years, I wonder what realm your cultivation has reached now! After I destroy Jianghai City, the next step will be to go to the Extreme North Glacier and fight you again in front of the whole world.</p><p></p><p>This time, I will personally slay you and wash away my previous humiliation!"</p><p></p><p>As soon as the words fell, three beams of light suddenly shot out from the ground.</p><p></p><p>They were Liu Chengxun, Yue Xinling, and Lian Chiming, the three Divine Patriarchs.</p><p></p><p>The three flew up, their faces extremely solemn.</p><p></p><p>Dragon Slayer's strength was too powerful, too powerful! So powerful that even they, at the Innate Seventh Rank and Innate Eighth Rank Divine Patriarch realms, felt a sense of suffocation.</p><p></p><p>The three Divine Patriarch realms had a heaven-and-earth difference in each layer.</p><p></p><p>The three flew up and did not attack, but only cupped their hands and said, "We have seen Senior Dragon, we don't know how Jianghai City has offended Senior Dragon, causing you to come in such a grand manner to attack Jianghai City!"</p><p></p><p>Dragon Slayer's gaze was still towards the north, without the slightest intention of looking at the three of them.</p><p></p><p>Clearly, in his eyes, he did not even consider Liu Chengxun and the other two.</p><p></p><p>"What this lord does, do I need to explain to you all?"</p><p></p><p>A casual sentence, fully displaying the domineering aura of the Demon Beast Alliance Leader.</p><p></p><p>The three looked at each other, their expressions extremely unsightly.</p><p></p><p>The battle below was still ongoing, and as Divine Patriarch-level experts, they could only watch helplessly without being able to join the battle casually.</p><p></p><p>Because they all knew that if they joined the battle and angered Dragon Slayer, a single attack from him could possibly send the entire Jianghai City into the sky.</p><p></p><p>But if it continued like this, Jianghai City would also be in great trouble.</p><p></p><p>Liu Chengxun took a deep breath and cupped his hands again:</p><p></p><p>"Senior, this junior dares to request that Senior spare the human tribes of Jianghai City, they are all innocent. This junior knows that Senior may not be willing to agree, so this junior has thought of a compromise.</p><p></p><p>This junior is willing to challenge Senior, to take one of Senior's attacks.</p><p></p><p>If this junior can withstand it, please let Jianghai City go. If this junior cannot withstand it, this junior's life can also be taken by Senior."</p><p></p><p>At these words, Yue Xinling and Lian Chiming quickly spoke up.</p><p></p><p>"Sword Saint Liu, you cannot."</p><p></p><p>"Yes, you are not his match, this one attack may very likely cost you your life."</p><p></p><p>Liu Chengxun took a deep breath, his face grave:</p><p></p><p>"Although I have not lived in Jianghai City for long, my ancestral home is also here. So even though I am not his match, facing the great calamity of Jianghai City, I cannot just stand by and watch.</p><p></p><p>If I can hold on, perhaps Jianghai City can still be saved.</p><p></p><p>Otherwise, if the Sword Immortal Senior does not come out, Jianghai City will be in great trouble today.</p><p></p><p>Moreover, it's just one attack, I should still be able to withstand it."</p><p></p><p>Dragon Slayer was indeed attracted by Liu Chengxun's words and finally withdrew his gaze, focusing it on Liu Chengxun.</p><p></p><p>"Quite interesting. Since that Sword Immortal has not shown up yet, this lord will just kill some time a bit."</p>

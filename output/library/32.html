        <h1>Chapter 32</h1>
        <div class="content">
            <p>Here is the full English translation of the excerpt:</p><p></p><p>"How could we not have eaten it? Which of your eyes saw us eating it? Even if you are the master, you need to provide evidence when you speak."</p><p></p><p>Ye Xiao was not angry, he just replied calmly:</p><p></p><p>"I need to remind you of one thing, the purple-scaled fish may be highly nourishing, but it is actually poisonous. If you eat it without proper professional processing, even if you are a master-level spirit beast, you will experience temporary muscle spasms."</p><p></p><p>Huan Liuli's body trembled a few times, her small head twitched uncontrollably, but she still tried to act calm.</p><p></p><p>"We're fine! Look, we're not having any muscle spasms!"</p><p></p><p>"There will also be eye-rolling and mental confusion."</p><p></p><p>Huan Liuli's eyes started rolling back, her body shifting between a human cat-eared loli form and her original cat form.</p><p></p><p>"We're doing great, our mind is very clear."</p><p></p><p>"There will also be foaming at the mouth, and in severe cases, it could lead to death."</p><p></p><p>Huan Liuli collapsed to the ground, convulsing and foaming at the mouth, unable to control the transformation between her beast and human forms, her little hooves twitching uncontrollably, but still stubbornly denying it.</p><p></p><p>"We're not foaming at the mouth, who's foaming at the mouth?"</p><p></p><p>Ye Xiao: "..."</p><p></p><p>After a moment, he sighed helplessly and squatted down to channel spiritual energy to treat Huan Liuli.</p><p></p><p>Given Huan Liuli's bloodline, she wouldn't be poisoned to death.</p><p></p><p>But if Qin Yuyan saw Huan Liuli in this state, it would be troublesome. If she recognized Huan Liuli as a master-level spirit beast, that would really cause problems.</p><p></p><p>At that point, his own identity would definitely be exposed, and his peaceful days would be over.</p><p></p><p>Outside, Qin Yuyan had changed into a new set of clothes, her clean little feet stepping in cute cartoon slippers as she walked downstairs.</p><p></p><p>"Grandpa, why did you suddenly come back? Isn't this during work hours?"</p><p></p><p>"It's all because of that Pao Jiansheng's mess."</p><p></p><p>"What happened to Pao Jiansheng?"</p><p></p><p>"I heard that the people in Hanzhou are very angry. Pao Jiansheng's master, the Hanzhou Sword Saint Liu Chengxun, wants to come challenge the top swordsman in Jiangcheng after he finishes his seclusion! Then he wants to take Pao Jiansheng back.</p><p></p><p>The higher-ups told me to cooperate with the defense team, and your Uncle Nangong Lin needs to find out who that top swordsman is as soon as possible? We can't have the situation where we can't even find the person when he comes to challenge, that would be embarrassing!"</p><p></p><p>Qin Yuyan was somewhat surprised.</p><p></p><p>"Is Liu Chengxun that powerful? Don't we have many experts in the Nine Provinces as well? Dares he come alone?"</p><p></p><p>"He's just coming to stand up for his disciple, it's a cultural exchange, not a crime. </p><p></p><p>If you don't let him come, won't the Nine Provinces be laughed at by the whole world?</p><p></p><p>However, although it's called a cultural exchange, he is still an extremely powerful expert! Even if we have experts who can subdue him in the Nine Provinces, we can't just kill him outright, right? During that time, the threat he poses to ordinary people in the Nine Provinces would be immense.</p><p></p><p>Unless our experts can kill him in one strike!"</p><p></p><p>Qin Yuyan's expression became somewhat grave.</p><p></p><p>"I don't know if Senior Blade Cultivator can defeat him. If we can't find the Senior Swordsman, at least finding the Senior Blade Cultivator would solve the problem."</p><p></p><p>"Who knows?" </p><p></p><p>Qin Shenglong sighed deeply, rubbing his temples.</p><p></p><p>"By the way, I just passed by the courtyard and felt like a few of my purple-scaled fish were missing. You didn't secretly eat them, did you? That thing is highly nourishing but poisonous, you can't just eat it casually. If it's not properly processed, even a master-level expert would..."</p><p></p><p>Here is the full English translation of the Chinese excerpt:</p><p></p><p>"It's poisoned, showing a violent reaction."</p><p></p><p>Qin Yuyan shook her head. "I didn't eat it, but how could it be missing? Is it that Grandpa has been under too much pressure lately and made a mistake?"</p><p></p><p>Qin Yuyan wouldn't associate this with Huan Liuli.</p><p></p><p>Because adult purple-scaled fish can reach the quasi-transcendent level, comparable to martial artists of the human realm's four to five realms, and they are adept at group attacks. </p><p></p><p>During group attacks, their power is multiplied several times.</p><p></p><p>For the Illusion Cat to prey on its companions among a large group of purple-scaled fish, its cultivation would have to be at least in the late quasi-transcendent level, close to the human realm's seven to eight realms, in order to do so.</p><p></p><p>But how could that be possible? Ye Xiao hasn't even awakened his divine soul, and his own cultivation hasn't reached the three-realm martial artist level. If Huan Liuli were a quasi-transcendent spirit beast, then what? It would have already eaten Ye Xiao, so how could it become his spirit pet?</p><p></p><p>So this is absolutely impossible! "I must have seen it wrong. There have been too many things happening lately, Grandpa is really getting old!"</p><p></p><p>Qin Shenglong sighed, then tidied up the documents.</p><p></p><p>"Okay, you stay at home, I'll go to the defense corps headquarters first and discuss it with your Uncle Nangong."</p><p></p><p>"Mm! Grandpa, take care."</p><p></p><p>Qin Yuyan watched as Qin Shenglong left, finally letting out a sigh of relief.</p><p></p><p>Fortunately, Grandpa didn't activate his master's sensing ability, otherwise, if he sensed Ye Xiao, that would be a big trouble.</p><p></p><p>In fact, what she didn't know was that Qin Shenglong had already activated his sensing ability when he first noticed his purple-scaled fish were missing.</p><p></p><p>But whether it was Ye Xiao or Huan Liuli, they were both experts beyond the master realm, and with the master-servant pair fully concealing their auras, his sensing ability became blind, completely unable to detect the presence of the two.</p><p></p><p>Afterwards, Qin Yuyan hurried back, and when she passed by the pool, she noticed a few purple fish scales on the edge of the pool, not yet dried.</p><p></p><p>This made her pupils contract, and her heart suddenly skipped a beat.</p><p></p><p>Could it be that someone really ate the purple-scaled fish, is it Ye Xiao's pet? Her heart suddenly started beating violently.</p><p></p><p>After taking a deep breath, she immediately ran upstairs.</p><p></p><p>However, when she arrived in her room, she found Ye Xiao hugging Huan Liuli, sitting on her bed and gently stroking Huan Liuli's fur. Huan Liuli was lying obediently in his arms.</p><p></p><p>"What's wrong?" Ye Xiao asked calmly.</p><p></p><p>Qin Yuyan's heartbeat gradually calmed down.</p><p></p><p>If Huan Liuli had eaten the purple-scaled fish, it should have been poisoned by now. The toxin of the purple-scaled fish is something even masters can't easily resist.</p><p></p><p>Seeing Huan Liuli in good condition, it must not have eaten the purple-scaled fish.</p><p></p><p>So she was just being ridiculous. How could Huan Liuli be able to eat purple-scaled fish? If that were the case, how powerful would Ye Xiao have to be? To have a spirit pet with the strength of a master or above, Ye Xiao would have to be a great grandmaster or even beyond, so how could he be just a librarian?</p><p></p><p>And how old is he? In front of her, he's still just a younger brother. Even if he had been cultivating since birth, he couldn't be that monstrous. </p><p></p><p>She didn't notice that there was a patch of white foam on the floor that she had stepped on when she came in.</p><p></p><p>(Chapter end)</p>

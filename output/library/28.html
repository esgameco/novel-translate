        <h1>Chapter 28</h1>
        <div class="content">
            <p>Here is the full English translation of the excerpt from the Chinese novel:</p><p></p><p>Director Jin's idea was quite simple.</p><p></p><p>Since even Pak Seon-saeng placed such great importance on the sword mark on this golden bull, it must be incredibly powerful. If they could buy it and bring it back to the country, imagine how many people would get to see it?</p><p></p><p>Wouldn't that mean cultivating a whole batch of talented swordsmen for the Greater Korean State? Shin Seong-ryong let out a cold laugh - as an experienced old hand, how could he not see through Director Jin's intentions?</p><p></p><p>"I'm sorry, but we're not selling this bull! I will be transferring it to our Gangbuk Martial Arts Academy."</p><p></p><p>The shamelessness of the Korean people is known worldwide. If this golden bull was given to them, and they used it to produce a large number of skilled swordsmen, who knows if they might come back to undermine our Jiuzhou.</p><p></p><p>Shin Seong-ryong was no fool.</p><p></p><p>"The price is negotiable, we can discuss it - 100 million, 200 million, 300 million! 1 billion! Money is no issue!"</p><p></p><p>Seeing Director Jin still wanting to persist, Doo Chang-wind smiled slightly.</p><p></p><p>"This sword mark was left by a top-class master. His cultivation might not be inferior to your Korean swordmaster Lyu Seung-sun. If you take his sword mark without permission and anger him, I don't think anyone in your Korean state can save you."</p><p></p><p>At these words, Director Jin was instantly drenched in cold sweat.</p><p></p><p>He had only wanted to buy this good thing and take it back, but hadn't considered this angle.</p><p></p><p>Indeed, the one who could leave such a sword mark must be no ordinary person. If he took it and offended the other party, it could truly lead to major trouble.</p><p></p><p>After a pause, he put on a smile and settled for a compromise.</p><p></p><p>"Director Shin is right, I was too presumptuous. But this sword mark was first discovered by our swordsman, so he should be allowed to observe it in Ganghai City, right?"</p><p></p><p>Shin Seong-ryong's brow furrowed slightly.</p><p></p><p>In fact, he didn't really want to let Pak Seon-saeng observe it either.</p><p></p><p>After all, Pak Seon-saeng was from the Korean state, and letting him observe it would still be a loss for Jiuzhou.</p><p></p><p>Martial arts know no borders, but martial artists have nationalities!</p><p></p><p>At this point, Doo Chang-wind transmitted a message:</p><p></p><p>"Agree to it! Pak Seon-saeng has already seen this sword mark and has an impression of it in his mind. Even if you don't let him see it, he's already remembered a lot, and you can't stop that now.</p><p></p><p>Rather than that, it's better to utilize his reputation to do some real work for the Ganghai Martial Arts Academy.</p><p></p><p>Recruit him into the Martial Arts Academy, and surely many applicants will come to join, drawn by his name.</p><p></p><p>Furthermore, as a disciple of Korean swordmaster Lyu Seung-sun, his sword dao attainments are not small. Let him teach you some techniques, and it will definitely enhance your sword dao comprehension - a win-win situation!"</p><p></p><p>Shin Seong-ryong's eyes lit up.</p><p></p><p>That's right!</p><p></p><p>Pak Seon-saeng has already seen it, so there's no way to stop that now. Instead, it's better to change the mindset and create some benefits for him.</p><p></p><p>What you take, you have to give back, and give back more!</p><p></p><p>There's no way we can let them take advantage of our Jiuzhou.</p><p></p><p>"Okay, I agree. But this sword mark is so precious, we can't leave it here. I'll take it back to the academy and preserve it.</p><p></p><p>If Pak Seon-saeng wants to continue observing it, he can become an exchange student at the Ganghai Martial Arts Academy."</p><p></p><p>"What did you say?" </p><p></p><p>Director Jin's expression suddenly changed.</p><p></p><p>Pak Seon-saeng is a rising star among the younger generation in Korea, the direct disciple of swordmaster Lyu Seung-sun! To make him an exchange student at a middle-tier academy like the Ganghai Martial Arts Academy, wouldn't that be letting them take advantage for free? The name effect he could bring would be immense. And Shin Seong-ryong couldn't just let one person see this sword mark - if he let tens of thousands see it, the significance for Pak Seon-saeng would not be as great. It's like a supreme technique - if one person has it, it's a supreme technique, but if ten thousand people have it, it's just common knowledge that anyone can break.</p><p></p><p>"No way!" Director Jin said.</p><p></p><p>Here is the full English translation of the Chinese excerpt:</p><p></p><p>"Reject it! Don't be ridiculous, it's always been the people of Han State taking advantage of others. How could we let others take advantage of Han State?"</p><p></p><p>"Then there's no other way. I'll take the Golden Bull first."</p><p></p><p>"Wait a moment."</p><p></p><p>Park Jian-sheng immediately stood up.</p><p></p><p>"I'm willing to join the Martial Arts Academy as an exchange student, but only for one year!"</p><p></p><p>"You're crazy!" </p><p></p><p>Chief Jin couldn't help but roar, and Park Jian-sheng spoke again:</p><p></p><p>"I'm not crazy, you go back and tell my master about this, he will handle it."</p><p></p><p>"You - ! Ah, you're just a lunatic! This time you're going to get me killed."</p><p></p><p>Qin Sheng-long and Du Chang-feng exchanged a glance, both revealing a cunning smile like old foxes.</p><p></p><p>It can't be said that they are shameless, after all, this is a competition between countries.</p><p></p><p>Park Jian-sheng has already seen this sword intent, unable to stop it, so he'll change the way, to extract some oil from him.</p><p></p><p>Although it's not righteous, as long as it's good for the Nine States, it's fine.</p><p></p><p>On Ye Xiao's side, in the library, he also saw the video of the confrontation between Qin Yu-yan and Park Jian-sheng.</p><p></p><p>It's not what he wanted to see, he's not interested in the confrontation between Qin Yu-yan and Park Jian-sheng at all.</p><p></p><p>Qin Yu-yan is already like that, and the Park Jian-sheng who confronted her, how strong could he be?</p><p></p><p>It's Gu Hai who's bored and annoying, insisting on bringing it up for him to watch.</p><p></p><p>After watching it, Ye Xiao couldn't help but let out a deep sigh.</p><p></p><p>It's really trash! It's just a complete waste of his time! In Ye Xiao's eyes, the confrontation between the two of them is like children playing house, utterly boring.</p><p></p><p>Even if their cultivation is suppressed to the level of post-heaven fifth-grade, Ye Xiao feels that he could single-handedly take on ten of them.</p><p></p><p>Park Jian-sheng is slightly better, but in his eyes, he's still rubbish.</p><p></p><p>"How is it? Old Ye, impressive, right?"</p><p></p><p>Ye Xiao responded with a nod.</p><p></p><p>"Very impressive! Great! Awesome!"</p><p></p><p>"There's even more impressive stuff! The forums, Weibo, and friend circles are all exploding with it now!"</p><p></p><p>"Oh? What's going on?"</p><p></p><p>"It's still about this Park Jian-sheng, he went to a roundabout in our Jianghai City, and it seems he discovered an extremely powerful sword intent, and immediately coughed up a mouthful of fresh blood on the spot, then stubbornly sat on that roundabout, refusing to leave.</p><p></p><p>Our Jianghai City is truly a place of heroes and exceptional land! First a peerless swordsman, and now a sword dao master! You tell me, why can't I encounter someone who wants to take me as a disciple?"</p><p></p><p>"Roundabout? Sword mark?"</p><p></p><p>Ye Xiao's brow furrowed slightly, somehow it sounded familiar.</p><p></p><p>If he remembered correctly, these past few days when he bought breakfast, it was also at a roundabout, where he had slain an evil spirit, at the time he had used spiritual power to kill it, although he had suppressed his strength to the extreme, trying to hold back, but it seems he had still left a fine sword mark on the Golden Bull there.</p><p></p><p>"Is there a video?"</p><p></p><p>"Yes!"</p><p></p><p>Gu Hai immediately found it for Ye Xiao, and when Ye Xiao saw the video, his face couldn't help but twitch violently.</p><p></p><p>Sure enough!</p><p></p><p>It's the same place!</p><p></p><p>However, this Park Jian-sheng, his eyes are quite sharp, he was actually able to discover it? He didn't use his full strength at all, that sword mark should be less than two inches long.</p><p></p><p>Damn it, it looks like I'll have to be more careful in the future.</p><p></p><p>Next time, try to leave not even a trace of a mark, otherwise, there will always be some troublesome matters.</p>

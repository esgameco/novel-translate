        <h1>Chapter 130</h1>
        <div class="content">
            <p>Here is the full English translation of the Chinese excerpt:</p><p></p><p>"Strange, why do I feel that all this fresh blood belongs to the Star Beasts? What are these fools doing? Didn't they carry out large-scale slaughter of the human race? Instead, they ended up getting themselves killed?"</p><p></p><p>King Aier raised his eyebrows slightly.</p><p></p><p>"It seems that in these years, humans have developed very quickly, and they are the strongest race among all the tribes in the universe. Hmph."</p><p></p><p>After a light snort, he shook his head again.</p><p></p><p>"Anyway, let me first accumulate energy and break the seal. As long as I get out, even if some insects die, it will be worth it."</p><p></p><p>As he absorbed the energy from the fresh blood, King Aier's strength was constantly increasing.</p><p></p><p>An extremely powerful aura gradually erupted from his body.</p><p></p><p>Suddenly, a faint 'crack' sound came from several sealing locations.</p><p></p><p>The evil power was revealed, and the skies above cities like Lingnan, Wanghai, and Jiangdong were all covered by black clouds.</p><p></p><p>The starlight and moonlight were all obscured.</p><p></p><p>"What's going on?"</p><p></p><p>The warriors in the central parts of several cities had not even had time to celebrate the slaughter of the Star Beasts, when in the blink of an eye, they were suppressed by this strange, awe-inspiring energy, causing their heartbeats to accelerate.</p><p></p><p>"Such a powerful force, this aura is probably not inferior to the peak of the Grand Master realm."</p><p></p><p>"Could it be that a Divine Ancestor has come? Damn it, the Seven Stars Convergence, and even a Divine Ancestor has come?"</p><p></p><p>"No, this aura, this is King Aier! It's King Aier who was sealed in several major cities!"</p><p></p><p>A few elderly people had already reacted that this was the aura of King Aier.</p><p></p><p>The lifespan of the martial artists was originally a bit longer, and especially the few Grand Masters who had even experienced the Beast Disaster fifty-six years ago!</p><p></p><p>So they remembered King Aier's aura.</p><p></p><p>"Hurry, go to the sealing locations."</p><p></p><p>However, just as they were about to take action, in an instant, the entire earth began to tremble violently.</p><p></p><p>Rumbling, the huge tremors plunged countless citizens into panic.</p><p></p><p>"What's happening? Is it an earthquake?"</p><p></p><p>The tremors did not last more than a few seconds, and a pure white light suddenly shot up from the center of the city, piercing the clouds.</p><p></p><p>At the same time, an extremely excited roar also reached the ears of the surrounding people.</p><p></p><p>"Hahaha, fifty-six years, a full fifty-six years, I, King Aier, have finally come out!"</p><p></p><p>In the next moment, that beam of light quickly gathered towards another direction.</p><p></p><p>"King Aier wants to reintegrate, his clones only have Grand Master-level strength. If he is allowed to reintegrate, he will truly regain Divine Ancestor-level cultivation!"</p><p></p><p>"Pursue the experts above Grand Master! The rest, quickly report this matter to the higher authorities."</p><p></p><p>On the other side, in the ravine, Ye Xiao's body began to gradually emit golden light.</p><p></p><p>This was not the light emitted by the Indestructible Divine Body, but rather his spiritual energy had broken through to an extreme limit, almost exceeding the current body's tolerance, causing the energy to excessively concentrate on the surface, forming the golden light.</p><p></p><p>At this moment, after Ye Xiao's body suffered a huge spiritual energy impact, his entire physical body underwent some fundamental changes.</p><p></p><p>Every single cell of his flesh had undergone earth-shattering changes.</p><p></p><p>In order to be able to control and withstand stronger power, his cells directly fused with the spiritual energy, becoming almost semi-spiritualized.</p><p></p><p>According to this manifestation of energy, Ye Xiao should have directly transformed into a spiritual being, but he did not, because his soul had also become stronger, and his spiritual power had become more powerful. Even without using powerful spiritual techniques like the Taixuan Heavenly Array, his spiritual power was like a tangible web, firmly locking every semi-spiritualized cell.</p><p></p><p>Ye Xiao previously knew that during the Grand Master realm, spiritual power would already manifest, but it would not be substantial, but rather attached to attacks.</p><p></p><p>So Grand Masters could destroy ghosts and deal with spiritual cultivators.</p><p></p><p>And at the Divine Ancestor realm, spiritual power would condense into substance and could be directly used as spiritual attacks.</p><p></p><p>Now he realized that this explanation was not entirely accurate.</p><p></p><p>To be precise, it is because the physical body requires the control of spiritual power, so spiritual power must also rise.</p><p></p><p>At the Master realm, the spiritual energy in the body was not too much, and it was only externalized, which the ordinary human body could still withstand.</p><p></p><p>At the Grand Master realm, the physical body had already begun to find it difficult to bear the burden, forcing the body to undergo a life evolution process of spiritual power enhancement.</p><p></p><p>Ultimately, at the Divine Ancestor realm, the physical body would undergo complete mutation or evolution, and then the spiritual power would rise again, condense into substance, and firmly lock the body's cells, preventing them from becoming spiritualized.</p><p></p><p>Spiritual power is not an additional enhancement that appears at the Divine Ancestor realm, but something that must be enhanced. </p><p></p><p>It's like matching a good horse with a good saddle, or a good car with good tires. For Divine Ancestors to fully unleash their power, they must also enhance their spiritual power.</p><p></p><p>Ye Xiao finally understood why the innate nine grades were divided into Master, Grand Master, and Divine Ancestor three processes.</p><p></p><p>In short, this is a process of life evolution.</p><p></p><p>A process of evolving from a human into a higher form of life.</p><p></p><p>Here is the full English translation of the Chinese excerpt:</p><p></p><p>The Process of the Mandate of Heaven.</p><p></p><p>This also explains why humans have to call the final process "Divine Sect"! It's simple, humans just love to show off and call themselves "divine", to have a high status.</p><p></p><p>Otherwise, why not call it Ghost Sect, Beast Sect, or Human Sect? But they insist on calling it Divine Sect.</p><p></p><p>I guess the one who first named it that way, the cultivator who first reached the Divine Sect realm, must have had a severe case of chuunibyou (middle school syndrome) as well.</p><p></p><p>Well, no matter, as long as my own cultivation has improved, that's a joyous thing. And the surrounding cities haven't been damaged by the Star Beasts, so the lamb skewers should be ready soon.</p><p></p><p>Everyone is happy!</p><p></p><p>At this moment, the divine book's spiritual awareness flashed, and Ye Xiao calmed his mind and swept a glance. The Earthly Oppression and Heavenly Pressure Formation had been completely mastered by the divine book, reaching the great perfection realm.</p><p></p><p>Then, just like the Supplementing the Heavens Art and the Stellar Incantation, two imperial arts of healing, emanating mutually attracting golden light, the Earthly Oppression and Heavenly Pressure Formation and the Heavenly Transformation Formation were also radiating mutually attracting golden light.</p><p></p><p>This means that the Earthly Oppression and Heavenly Pressure Formation and the Heavenly Transformation Formation, two fundamentally different imperial formations, can also be fused after adding another different imperial formation? This is good news.</p><p></p><p>"It's time to return to Jianghai City, the lamb skewers should be awakening soon."</p><p></p><p>Ye Xiao pondered for a moment, and with a thought, instantly transformed into a golden light, shooting towards the sky.</p><p></p><p>Boom! In an instant, the entire earth violently trembled, as if unable to withstand this tremendous shaking force.</p><p></p><p>The sky also let out a series of violent tremors.</p><p></p><p>Because Ye Xiao's speed was simply too fast, and his body was completely surrounded by spiritual energy. Although he was just one person, the range he affected exceeded that of a large rocket.</p><p></p><p>"So fast!" </p><p></p><p>Ye Xiao couldn't help but exclaim in surprise. From the Innate Sixth Grade to the Innate Seventh Grade, although it was only a single grade increase, the improvement in strength was so great, far exceeding the leap from Fifth Grade to Sixth Grade.</p><p></p><p>With the inherent cultivation base enhancement, combined with the Divine Meaning Incantation, the speed was simply absurd! This speed was even momentarily beyond his control.</p><p></p><p>But it would be fine after a bit of adaptation.</p><p></p><p>Ye Xiao took a deep breath, not activating the Grand Heavenly Pressure, but fully releasing the restraints on his body, using only the pure spiritual power of the Divine Sect level to adapt and get used to the changes in his strength.</p><p></p><p>In this way, in a short moment, he should be able to fully adapt to the power of the Divine Sect level.</p><p></p><p>After releasing the mental restraints, Ye Xiao's speed became even faster.</p><p></p><p>In the sky, it was like a flash of lightning, vanishing in an instant.</p><p></p><p>Due to the extreme speed, even the sound of air explosion was gone.</p><p></p><p>Now, Ye Xiao could completely catch up to the lower range of lightning.</p><p></p><p>Under the starry sky, back at the American base, a group of scientists were enthusiastically applauding, celebrating the successful trial of the new aerospace technology.</p><p></p><p>"The new model we just tested is based on the previous generation, with further improvements and optimizations.</p><p></p><p>The new aircraft has more powerful kinetic energy, consuming Grandmaster-level Star Beast cores.</p><p></p><p>But the speed it can achieve has reached above the Innate Fifth Grade, an entire level faster than the previous generation!"</p><p></p><p>"With this, the level of our American state will rise to a new level. This will greatly contribute to maintaining our dominance in the star battlefield.</p><p></p><p>At least within the next ten years, no other state will be able to surpass our overall capabilities."</p><p></p><p>Some scientists even had slightly moist eyes.</p><p></p><p>It wasn't easy. Ever since the last aircraft was destroyed by a Ninth State Grand Master, they had been working tirelessly day and night, finally breaking through the previous generation's technology and increasing the speed by a level.</p><p></p><p>This time, the commander shouldn't have any more complaints, right? But just at that moment, the electronic screen suddenly emitted a rapid alarm sound.</p><p></p><p>Ding ding ding...</p><p></p><p>Everyone was startled, looking towards the screen, only to see a bright red dot rapidly approaching the test aircraft at a speed visible to the naked eye.</p><p></p><p>"Oh my god, what is that?"</p><p></p><p>"No matter what it is, this time we don't want to get into trouble again, immediately recall the test aircraft."</p><p></p><p>However, before the words had even fallen, the red light beam, like a sniper bullet, ruthlessly pierced through the new test aircraft.</p><p></p><p>Boom! In the sky, a brilliant and bright flame erupted, and all the scientists in the laboratory were furious.</p><p></p><p>"Oh, fuck!"</p><p></p><p>"I'm going to ask the commander for reinforcements, send out our strongest forces in America to kill him!"</p><p></p><p>"That damned beast!"</p><p></p><p>In the starry sky, Ye Xiao quickly stopped his body, and even then, it was only after tens of thousands of meters that he barely managed to stop.</p><p></p><p>The speed was too fast, and the inertia was too great.</p><p></p><p>"Strange! Did I just hit something?"</p><p></p><p>Six updates, 18,000 words, continue to work hard.</p><p></p><p>Seeking subscriptions, recommendations, and monthly votes!</p><p></p><p>(This chapter is complete)</p>

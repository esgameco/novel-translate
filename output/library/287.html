        <h1>Chapter 287</h1>
        <div class="content">
            <p>Here is the full English translation of the Chinese excerpt:</p><p></p><p>The kings were furious, but at this moment, they could only suppress their anger.</p><p></p><p>Because if they didn't suppress it, it would mean death.</p><p></p><p>"Hurry up and get out of here!"</p><p></p><p>The Venerable White Tiger roared, and the kings gritted their teeth, but in the end, they could only turn around and leave.</p><p></p><p>A crisis was thus resolved.</p><p></p><p>The moment the Azure Dragon appeared, everything was already destined.</p><p></p><p>Everyone let out a sigh of relief and paid their respects to the Azure Dragon.</p><p></p><p>"Azure Dragon, we owe you this time. If it weren't for you, we might not have been able to handle it."</p><p></p><p>The Azure Dragon did not answer, but simply said indifferently:</p><p></p><p>"What realm has that child reached?"</p><p></p><p>Xuanwu smiled with a hint of satisfaction and replied, "He has already reached the peak of the King Realm, the level of half-step Emperor Realm. He only lacks a bit of enlightenment to completely step into the realm of Emperor Realm experts."</p><p></p><p>The Azure Dragon pondered for a moment.</p><p></p><p>"One month from now, let that child fight me. I will use my lifetime of martial arts experience to lend him a hand and help him break through to the Emperor Realm."</p><p></p><p>With that, the Azure Dragon turned and left.</p><p></p><p>But these words rang out like a heavy bomb in everyone's ears.</p><p></p><p>Li Liushui's eyes widened as he incredulously said:</p><p></p><p>"Venerable, did the Azure Dragon Sword Sovereign just say what I think he said?"</p><p></p><p>Venerable Xuanwu sighed deeply.</p><p></p><p>"Didn't you hear? He wants to be a stepping stone for Ye Xiao, using his lifetime of martial arts experience to help Ye Xiao break through the last step."</p><p></p><p>Li Liushui was so shocked that he was speechless.</p><p></p><p>What an honor this was!</p><p></p><p>The Azure Dragon Sword Sovereign, the number one figure in the Nine Provinces and even the world, was willing to make himself a stepping stone to help Ye Xiao break through to the Emperor Realm.</p><p></p><p>What a great determination he must have to do this? His dignity, his honor, would all be trampled on by Ye Xiao.</p><p></p><p>But this is not the most important thing.</p><p></p><p>The most important thing is the Azure Dragon's martial arts heart!</p><p></p><p>The best martial artists should be single-minded, without any mental demons or fetters.</p><p></p><p>If the Azure Dragon loses to Ye Xiao, his martial arts heart may be affected.</p><p></p><p>Although it cannot be said that he will definitely be unable to break through to the Emperor Realm in the future, it will greatly reduce his chances of doing so.</p><p></p><p>It can be said that if he really does this, it is equivalent to sacrificing his high probability of becoming an Emperor to help Ye Xiao break through, and from then on, his chances of breaking through will become a small probability.</p><p></p><p>And all this is his own voluntary offering.</p><p></p><p>What a noble character! In fact, only the Venerable Trio of Fenghuang, Xuanwu, and the others truly understand why the Azure Dragon is doing this. It is for the sake of the Nine Provinces!</p><p></p><p>An Emperor Realm expert can sway the tide of a beast disaster, although he also has the hope of breaking through to the Emperor Realm himself.</p><p></p><p>But even with a high probability of success, it is not a guaranteed success, not a definite success. </p><p></p><p>As long as he has not truly reached that realm, he can never say for sure that he can break through that realm, it is always just a probability issue.</p><p></p><p>Admittedly, if he lets Ye Xiao be his stepping stone, there is also a good chance that Ye Xiao will break through to the Emperor Realm expert level.</p><p></p><p>But first, Ye Xiao may not be willing to do so.</p><p></p><p>Secondly, Ye Xiao is younger than him, and Ye Xiao has a better chance of breaking through to even higher realms in the future, which is why the Azure Dragon ultimately chose to make himself the stepping stone to assist Ye Xiao's ascent.</p><p></p><p>In order to make the Nine Provinces better, to obtain an even higher-level expert, he chose to sacrifice himself.</p><p></p><p>It is because he is the Azure Dragon Venerable, one of the four guardians of the Nine Provinces.</p><p></p><p>When the interests of the country, the nation, and the individual conflict, he chooses the country and the nation.</p><p></p><p>It is under the self-sacrifice of such generation after generation of heroes that the Nine Provinces have been able to endure.</p><p></p><p>On the other side, Ye Xiao, under the transmission portal opened by Youwei, came to the starry sky for the first time.</p><p></p><p>Between the ground and the starry sky, there is a defensive barrier set up by the ancestors of the human race.</p><p></p><p>If there was no such barrier, all the star beasts could easily come to the human world.</p><p></p><p>This barrier isolates the human race and the star beasts. If you want to break through the barrier, there are only two methods.</p><p></p><p>One method is to open a spatial transmission portal through the power of a powerful existence.</p><p></p><p>The other method is to use secret techniques to open a spatial transmission portal.</p><p></p><p>This spatial transmission portal is very small, and within a certain time period, it can only transmit one or two people, which is the limit.</p><p></p><p>If too many people are transmitted, it will trigger the defensive mechanism, directly killing the lives in the transmission portal.</p><p></p><p>Another aspect is that it cannot transmit the existence of too strong power, unless it is the human race!</p><p></p><p>This is also why, although there are some transmission portals, the star beasts still cannot use this "bug" to invade the human world.</p><p></p><p>Although Ye Xiao has already reached the half-step Emperor Realm, he is of the human race, so he is not within the scope of this shielding.</p><p></p><p>When he first came to the starry sky, Ye Xiao thought that the starry sky above was the same as before.</p><p></p><p>Everywhere in the universe were spherical bodies. But after truly arriving in the starry sky, Ye Xiao found that the planets in this universe were not like what he had imagined, but rather an inverted cone shape.</p><p></p><p>The world of the human race is more like a round earth.</p><p></p><p>Above the ground is a semi-circular protective layer, although...</p><p></p><p>Here is the full English translation of the Chinese excerpt:</p><p></p><p>Ye Xiao wanted to use some more respectful words, but he felt that only a rolled ice cream was the most suitable to describe the human world.</p><p></p><p>In the sky above the human world, in a place extremely far away from Ye Xiao, there were several smaller land masses, and Ye Xiao's divine sense could perceive from them that there was abundant spiritual energy and many forms of life.</p><p></p><p>Upon careful consideration, those places should be the legendary star battlefields, right?</p><p></p><p>"Is this the star realm?"</p><p></p><p>Youwei smiled and explained, "Yes, this is the true appearance of the star realm. But the place we are in now is the edge of the human world.</p><p></p><p>The human world is the largest world in this star realm, but the entire star realm is far more than just one human world. There are many other human worlds, and even worlds much larger than this human world.</p><p></p><p>Among them, there are human races, as well as the star beast races, and even the divine races!"</p><p></p><p>Hearing the words "divine races", Ye Xiao's eyes flickered.</p><p></p><p>"I'm surprised you even know about the divine races. Are there many divine races in the star realm?"</p><p></p><p>Youwei gave a bitter smile.</p><p></p><p>"Senior Ye, I only know the concept exists. But as for how many there are, I'm not sure, after all, our entire Silver Fox Clan has never produced a cultivator above the divine realm."</p><p></p><p>Ye Xiao nodded.</p><p></p><p>"Then let's go. The territory of the Silver Fox Clan is still far from here."</p><p></p><p>"That would be a waste of time."</p><p></p><p>With that, Ye Xiao reached out and grabbed Youwei's shoulder.</p><p></p><p>Youwei's delicate body trembled, and her heartbeat suddenly began to accelerate.</p><p></p><p>Ah ah ah, Senior Ye is grabbing my shoulder, what is he going to do? Could it be that he wants to do something to me?</p><p></p><p>Although he is a senior and a powerful expert, and the Silver Fox Clan is relatively friendly with the human race, she is not just any casual fox. </p><p></p><p>It's impossible that just because Senior Ye is extremely powerful and handsome, she would casually agree to let him do anything.</p><p></p><p>And this is her first time, the elders in the clan said the first time would be very painful, should she ask Senior Ye to be gentle with her, not too rough?</p><p></p><p>Just as her little mind was filled with wild thoughts, the next moment, the scenery in front of her suddenly changed, and she found herself in a valley filled with birdsong and fragrant flowers.</p><p></p><p>Youwei: "(!_!)?!"</p><p></p><p>How does this place look so familiar? Isn't this the Silver Fox Valley where the Silver Fox Clan lives?</p><p></p><p>But just now, wasn't she still at the border of the human world? The Silver Fox Valley and the border of the human world are separated by nearly a hundred thousand miles, yet in the blink of an eye, the senior has brought her here? This speed is simply too fast, too fast for her soul to even react.</p><p></p><p>In fact, not only was Youwei shocked, but Ye Xiao was also slightly surprised. This was the first time since he had obtained the Yin-Yang Escape Technique that he had fully unleashed its power.</p><p></p><p>Previously in the Nine States, because the distance between them was too close, he had never truly unleashed his full strength, nor had he fully demonstrated the full power of the Yin-Yang Escape Technique.</p><p></p><p>Now, on his first attempt, in just a few seconds, he had traveled from the border of the human world to the Silver Fox Valley.</p><p></p><p>The speed was truly astonishing.</p><p></p><p>He wondered how fast he would be if he reached the Emperor Realm.</p><p></p><p>After Ye Xiao appeared in the Silver Fox Valley, many pairs of eyes were fixed on him.</p><p></p><p>"Wow, he's so handsome!"</p><p>"He has the aura of the human race, how can someone outside our Silver Fox Clan be so good-looking?"</p><p>"Grandma said the milk of the human race is sweet, I want to try some."</p><p></p><p>Hearing these words, Youwei immediately glared fiercely at the group of fox maidens dressed in very revealing attire, with alluring features.</p><p></p><p>"You bunch of little sluts, what are you babbling about? If you don't believe me, I'll tear your mouths apart! This is an honored guest invited by the Holy Son, whoever dares to be disrespectful will be punished according to the clan rules!"</p><p></p><p>The young silver foxes heard this and immediately became well-behaved, their faces turning innocent like pure young maidens.</p><p></p><p>Ye Xiao finally understood the origins of the "fox spirit" - these foxes were natural experts at dealing with men.</p><p></p><p>However, his heart was focused on the martial dao, so he did not care about these beauties at all, seeing them no differently than skeletons.</p><p></p><p>Naturally, he would not pay any attention to these little foxes.</p><p></p><p>Youwei secretly glanced at Ye Xiao, seeing that his expression remained calm and he showed no signs of coveting her, and she couldn't help but admire him inwardly.</p><p></p><p>Indeed, Senior Ye is truly remarkable! His state of mind is something that others are far from being able to match.</p><p></p><p>Of all the men she has encountered so far, in front of Senior Ye, they are all light years away.</p><p></p><p>How ridiculous that she just now fantasized about Senior Ye wanting to do something to her? It's laughable to the extreme, probably he wouldn't even bother to look at her.</p><p></p><p>She really doesn't know what realm Senior Ye is at now? Taking a deep breath, she made a gesture of invitation.</p><p></p><p>"Senior Ye, please."</p>

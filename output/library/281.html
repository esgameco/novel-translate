        <h1>Chapter 281</h1>
        <div class="content">
            <p>Here is the full English translation of the Chinese excerpt:</p><p></p><p>Of course, the Trembling Star Tiger saw that sword strike! That ultimate sword strike, with a power that was almost heaven-piercing and earth-shattering.</p><p></p><p>Even the Divine Ancestor could detect it in an instant, so how could he not feel it? However, feeling it was one thing, defending against it was another!</p><p></p><p>Ye Xiao's sword strike was dazzlingly brilliant, covering an area of thousands of miles in an instant.</p><p></p><p>Unless he had the strength to instantly leap out of the range of thousands of miles, he would be unable to evade this sword strike.</p><p></p><p>This is why, even if one's strength is high, it does not mean one can dodge the techniques. Certain attacks can still lock onto the target.</p><p></p><p>A warrior's attack, because the spiritual energy is amplified through the technique, its speed can surpass the warrior's own!</p><p></p><p>It's like a person holding a gun - they can't catch up to the enemy, but the bullet can.</p><p></p><p>To avoid the technique, one must either be far superior in cultivation to the opponent, or far surpass the opponent in body movement speed, exceeding the speed of the opponent's technique.</p><p></p><p>The sword beam flashed, its speed astonishing.</p><p></p><p>In fact, the Trembling Star Tiger didn't even feel any pain before his head was already flying up, spinning in the air.</p><p></p><p>The sword beam's momentum did not diminish, its radiance directly piercing the black clouds in the sky.</p><p></p><p>In the sky above, Blood Wing was still thinking about how to coax Trembling Star Tiger to the Long White Dragon Vein after rescuing his subordinates.</p><p></p><p>Suddenly, he sensed an earth-shattering aura from below.</p><p></p><p>Before he could react, he saw Trembling Star Tiger's severed head.</p><p></p><p>In a light cough, his mind came to a standstill.</p><p></p><p>What was happening? What had occurred?</p><p></p><p>Trembling Star Tiger was killed in a single sword strike? A single sword strike?</p><p></p><p>That was no ordinary person! He was the 97th ranked super expert on the Star Battlefield!  And he just died like that, without even a struggle.</p><p></p><p>Who struck that blow? Was he even human?</p><p></p><p>No, he shouldn't be thinking about that now, because that sword beam, with undiminished momentum, was already approaching him.</p><p></p><p>"So fast!"</p><p></p><p>He desperately unleashed his body techniques, and fortunately, as he had cultivated body techniques as his main focus, he managed to narrowly escape the killing blow by a margin of 0.01 seconds.</p><p></p><p>However, even then, he could not completely evade Ye Xiao's sword strike.</p><p></p><p>Because the power of this sword strike was simply too great, too overwhelming.</p><p></p><p>The fluctuations emanating from the sword beam mercilessly churned the surrounding space, and anything within a certain range was unable to dodge or resist it.</p><p></p><p>Even his god-beast level powerful physique could not withstand or evade it, and in the end, it shattered half of his wings.</p><p></p><p>"Damn it!" </p><p></p><p>Blood Wing couldn't help but curse out loud, and the next moment he immediately spread his wings and fled at top speed, not daring to stop for even half a second.</p><p></p><p>This person who had suddenly appeared was too terrifying in strength!</p><p></p><p>In the face of his sword techniques, Blood Wing felt like he was just mud, unable to put up any resistance. The most important thing was to save his own life!</p><p></p><p>But his thoughts were too optimistic, as Ye Xiao would not let him escape so easily.</p><p></p><p>The Plucking Star Hand activated, and the sky above was directly and vividly confined by Ye Xiao's power.</p><p></p><p>"Noâ€”!"</p><p></p><p>Blood Wing's face was filled with terror, his remaining blood wing frantically twisting, his hands desperately clawing forward as his spiritual energy erupted to the fullest.</p><p></p><p>But Ye Xiao was too strong, he had no way to escape from Ye Xiao's Plucking Star Hand, just like a drowning bird, no matter how he struggled, the final result would be the same.</p><p></p><p>With a clenching of Ye Xiao's big hand, the divine beast Blood Wing directly exploded into a mist of blood, and his storage ring also fell into Ye Xiao's hands.</p><p></p><p>Ye Xiao did not leave Blood Wing's corpse behind.</p><p></p><p>He could see at a glance that the other party was not a pure star beast, but a half-beast.</p><p></p><p>Ye Xiao had never eaten half-beasts, as their bloodline had half human ancestry.</p><p></p><p>Even if they had cultivated to great strength, their bloodline had long since transformed and leaned towards the star beasts, but Ye Xiao still had some resistance towards this.</p><p></p><p>Moreover, he only needed the dragon qi in the other's storage ring.</p><p></p><p>However, the Tiger God, he would keep.</p><p></p><p>Tiger bone soaked in wine is good for the body, tiger skin can be used to strengthen the defensive properties of his own clothes, and he had never eaten tiger meat, but paired with the meat of the Sealed Dragon, it should make for an interesting Dragon Tiger Battle dish.</p><p></p><p>Most importantly, the other had something precious on him.</p><p></p><p>That precious item was the most important treasure of Trembling Star Tiger, and if he could take it, it would definitely be a great supplement.</p><p></p><p>Unfortunately, Ye Xiao had not yet reached the Emperor Realm, and the Supremely Mysterious Heaven Grasping Technique required being one entire realm higher than the opponent to search their memories. Otherwise, even if he searched Trembling Star Tiger's memories, he would not be able to find out how powerful the person behind him was.</p><p></p><p>Or find out how much strength and hidden cards the star beasts possessed.</p><p></p><p>But he had still gained a lot, after all, the other party had come to him for free, he couldn't be too picky.</p><p></p><p>After obtaining Trembling Star Tiger, Ye Xiao directly scanned his star core and unexpectedly extracted two imperial art cultivation techniques from it.</p><p></p><p>One was a palm technique, the Trembling Star Palm!</p><p></p><p>In addition to the Tathagata Divine Palm, Ye Xiao now had...</p><p></p><p>Here is the full English translation of the Chinese excerpt:</p><p></p><p>In addition to the imperial-level palm technique, there was another imperial-level palm technique.</p><p></p><p>If another one could be found, it could be directly combined.</p><p></p><p>The other one was a cultivation method that Ye Xiao had not practiced before - the Roaring in the Mountains! It belonged to the sound technique category! This was a technique that used sound as the attack method, very special, penetrating everywhere, and had some similarities with the spiritual techniques, but its main focus was on harming the physical body! While the spiritual techniques mainly focused on harming the physical body.</p><p></p><p>After obtaining the cultivation method, the remaining use value of the Tiger God was only to be a livestock.</p><p></p><p>Ye Xiao directly took it to the breeding farm.</p><p></p><p>Seeing Ye Xiao come in, all the star beasts were startled, and when they saw the corpse of the Tiger God in Ye Xiao's hand, they couldn't help but become sorrowful.</p><p></p><p>"Tiger God!"</p><p></p><p>"No! Tiger God, wuwuwu."</p><p></p><p>Ye Xiao comforted: "Don't be so sad! I can revive him."</p><p></p><p>After saying this, the star beasts became even more sad.</p><p></p><p>Ye Xiao didn't care about them, and directly practiced the Eternal Life Sutra, and in the blink of an eye, he revived the Tiger God.</p><p></p><p>The Trembling Star Tiger originally felt that his consciousness had fallen into a sea of darkness. But unexpectedly, there was a ray of light in this darkness, and it quickly approached him.</p><p></p><p>"What the hell is this?"</p><p></p><p>He couldn't help but reach out and touch it.</p><p></p><p>In the next second, he was revived.</p><p></p><p>Looking at the surrounding star beasts, he had a puzzled expression on his face.</p><p></p><p>"Where is this place?"</p><p></p><p>"Where am I?"</p><p></p><p>"Who brought me here?"</p><p></p><p>"What have you been hiding here all this time?"</p><p></p><p>The star beasts rushed over, crying in a group.</p><p></p><p>"Tiger God, wuwuwu why did you have to come over? Didn't we release the aura to tell you not to come?"</p><p></p><p>Trembling Star Tiger was puzzled:</p><p></p><p>"You released the aura, weren't you asking me for help? I thought you were trapped and wanted me to come rescue you, so that's why I came."</p><p></p><p>The star beasts looked at each other blankly.</p><p></p><p>And Noel Fei and a few other star beasts who were not under the Tiger God's command had already held back their internal injuries! "Hahaha."</p><p></p><p>"It's so deceiving!"</p><p></p><p>"I've been telling you not to do any tricks. Now it's backfired and got you trapped."</p><p></p><p>Trembling Star Tiger had already noticed Ye Xiao, his pupils constricting.</p><p></p><p>It's him!</p><p></p><p>He could clearly sense the aura on Ye Xiao.</p><p></p><p>Last time, in the temporal corridor, it was him who escaped from right under his nose.</p><p></p><p>And just now, that sword was too fast, he didn't sense the aura on it, but he's not a pig-brained idiot.</p><p></p><p>That sword, even if it wasn't Ye Xiao's, was from Ye Xiao's senior or teacher, so Ye Xiao's identity was definitely not simple.</p><p></p><p>"Who are you exactly? How come you're also here?"</p><p></p><p>Feng Long said sadly:</p><p></p><p>"Tiger God, his name is Ye Xiao, he is the owner of this star beast breeding farm. He is also the one who killed you and then revived you."</p><p></p><p>The Tiger God's heart skipped a beat, and his heartbeat couldn't help but start to accelerate.</p><p></p><p>It's really him.</p><p></p><p>This guy is too terrifying.</p><p></p><p>If he remembered correctly, last time Ye Xiao was not his match.</p><p></p><p>Unexpectedly, in the blink of an eye, Ye Xiao had become such an existence. Able to instantly kill him.</p><p></p><p>This guy's growth speed is a bit too fast, isn't it?</p><p></p><p>Although it's said that the growth speed of the human race is very fast, his speed has already become superhuman.</p><p></p><p>Wait a minute! Something seems a bit off.</p><p></p><p>"What did you just say? Breeding farm? What breeding farm? What does that mean?"</p><p></p><p>"Star beast breeding farm!"</p><p></p><p>"It means he wants to raise us like livestock and poultry, slicing our meat every day to supply his cultivation and advancement."</p><p></p><p>Trembling Star Tiger was silent for a moment, then suddenly roared: "So you bunch of damned bastards have become his livestock and poultry? Have you forgotten your own identity? </p><p></p><p>What do you think you are? You are the noble star beasts! Experts above the divine sect! How can you betray the dignity of the star beasts and become the slaves of the human race?"</p><p></p><p>The star beasts were extremely ashamed.</p><p></p><p>"Sorry, Tiger God, it was our fault. But we also have our difficulties."</p><p></p><p>"Yes! We couldn't beat him at all. Not to mention that. He also has healing techniques, so even if we want to die, we can't. He tortures us over and over again. Even if we resist, it's useless, he can directly kill us and forcibly take our blood and flesh, and then revive us."</p><p></p><p>Trembling Star Tiger was shaking with anger.</p><p></p><p>"Even if that's the case, you can't so easily become the poultry and livestock of the human race? This is such a shameful thing! If news of this gets out, how will you still be able to survive in the star beast world? You will be seen as the disgrace of the entire star beast world."</p><p></p><p>These guys simply don't care about their own face at all.</p><p></p><p>Feng Long and the other star beasts were even more ashamed.</p><p></p><p>"Tiger God, we were wrong."</p>

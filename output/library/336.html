        <h1>Chapter 336</h1>
        <div class="content">
            <p>Here is the full English translation of the Chinese excerpt:</p><p></p><p>In fact, from the very beginning when the Jing Emperor started speaking, he had a vague premonition in his heart.</p><p></p><p>This person was most likely Zheng Ge.</p><p></p><p>Although there were some differences between the history of this world and his previous life, the personalities and strengths of the characters were quite similar.</p><p></p><p>Unexpectedly, the amazing Zheng Ge from the previous life, in this world, was also overwhelmingly unreasonable.</p><p></p><p>He disdained the ancestors of the human race, and with a human body, he comprehended the divine techniques in the divine blood, and then led his troops to break through the star beast's defenses and enter the starry sky.</p><p></p><p>It was simply amazing!</p><p></p><p>And then there was Xia Bingning.</p><p></p><p>Her talent was also very strong.</p><p></p><p>But she had said before that the place she was in had a gathering of experts and many geniuses, and she could only be considered above average there, far from being at the top level.</p><p></p><p>Ye Xiao was now beginning to suspect that she might be from a certain divine clan?</p><p></p><p>If that was the case, it would mean that there were many talented individuals of very high level in the starry sky!</p><p></p><p>Among them, there might even be quite a few people whose cultivation speed surpassed his own, and there might even be many peers whose cultivation was higher than his.</p><p></p><p>Just thinking about it was exciting.</p><p></p><p>It seems that in the future, with the arrival of the divine clans, he should try to stay low-key as much as possible.</p><p></p><p>If there's no problem in the early stage, he should try to stay in the library and read books, and avoid going out casually.</p><p></p><p>This way, he can minimize trouble.</p><p></p><p>Of course, the most important thing is to hurry up and cultivate.</p><p></p><p>When he first came to this world, he didn't understand it deeply enough.</p><p></p><p>He just felt that he didn't have that kind of talent, and there was no need to force himself to cultivate to any realm, he could just go with the flow.</p><p></p><p>Moreover, this world previously had a well-established social order.</p><p></p><p>Aside from the danger of the star beasts, there was not much great danger in getting along with others as an ordinary person. Even if he didn't cultivate, he wouldn't have too much trouble.</p><p></p><p>But now it's different.</p><p></p><p>The arrival of the divine clans will bring many powerful experts.</p><p></p><p>And he doesn't know what the laws of the Xuanyuan Clan are like? Ye Xiao remembered that in the novels he read in his previous life, some similar high-powered worlds followed the law of the survival of the fittest.</p><p></p><p>They might wipe out an entire family over the slightest disagreement! Especially those young people who shouted all kinds of strange slogans, they were like unkillable cockroaches - you couldn't kill them no matter how hard you tried, and after going out to train for a while, they would come back and slap you to death.</p><p></p><p>However, Ye Xiao couldn't quite remember some of the words, because they were a bit cringy and it was a long time ago.</p><p></p><p>He only vaguely remembered a very famous saying, what was it called again?</p><p></p><p>The lion roars in the east, the lion roars in the west? The river... what was it again?</p><p></p><p>He couldn't remember the rest.</p><p></p><p>Forget it, don't think about it anymore, just focus on practical matters and improve his own strength.</p><p></p><p>He now needs a huge amount of spiritual energy to refine the protective dragon qi.</p><p></p><p>Only by refining a full 108 layers of protective dragon qi would he have a chance to advance to the divine realm.</p><p></p><p>But the speed of cultivating the dragon qi through cultivation techniques and star beast meat is still too slow.</p><p></p><p>If some opportunity came knocking, it would be great, allowing him to quickly increase his dragon qi.</p><p></p><p>Just as he was thinking about this problem, suddenly, a dragon's roar echoed in his mind.</p><p></p><p>Ye Xiao's eyes narrowed, and the Jing Emperor next to him also had a drastic change in expression.</p><p></p><p>The two exchanged a glance.</p><p></p><p>"It's the Great Wall Formation, the formation has automatically activated."</p><p></p><p>"Why would the formation activate at this time? Could it be that a powerful expert from the divine clan has arrived?"</p><p></p><p>Ye Xiao shook his head.</p><p></p><p>"No, it's not an expert from the divine clan, it's a star beast."</p><p></p><p>As soon as he said that, he instantly disappeared from the spot.</p><p></p><p>"A star beast! Such a huge aura, could it be..."</p><p></p><p>The Jing Emperor's expression changed drastically, as he had already guessed the reason.</p><p></p><p>The next moment, he also flew up into the sky, standing side by side with Ye Xiao.</p><p></p><p>The Azure Dragon also rushed over from afar.</p><p></p><p>Looking at the huge black mist in the sky, he couldn't help but say with a trembling voice:</p><p></p><p>"What a powerful aura. This aura is so strong, it has surpassed all the star beasts we have ever seen."</p><p></p><p>The Jing Emperor clenched his fists, his expression extremely serious.</p><p></p><p>"It's the Forest God - Lin Qingbei! The second-ranked expert on the Star Ranking in the past. In fact, he was originally a half-beast, but later, due to his monstrous talent, he cultivated to become a supreme expert in just two hundred years! His strength could easily crush all the previous supreme star beasts, becoming the most powerful top-tier ace among the star beasts.</p><p></p><p>But looking at his current aura, it is many times stronger than before.</p><p></p><p>If my guess is correct, he must have absorbed the divine blood of other star beasts, allowing his power to reach a new peak.</p><p></p><p>Now he can be said to completely dominate the Star Ranking!"</p><p></p><p>Hearing this, the Azure Dragon couldn't help but feel a chill running down his spine.</p><p></p><p>A cold sensation rose from the soles of his feet to the top of his head.</p><p></p><p>"This guy is so strong, Ye Xiao, I think you'd better not go out. With the Great Wall Formation set up by the Ancestor Dragon Emperor, it should still be able to hold out.</p><p></p><p>Even if he is that strong, he still can't...</p><p></p><p>Here is the full English translation of the Chinese excerpt:</p><p></p><p>"The Great Wall formation that is impossible to break through!" </p><p></p><p>But Ye Xiao shook his head. "I must go!"</p><p></p><p>At this moment, he was in dire need of a massive energy supplement.</p><p></p><p>Lin Qingbei's body contained the divine blood of the Winged Tribe, Thunder Tribe, and Giant Ape Tribe, extracted from hundreds of billions of people.</p><p></p><p>Lin Qingbei's previous power was likely not as strong as the Emperor of Scenery, as Ye Xiao had heard that the Emperor of Scenery ranked first on the Star Ranking.</p><p></p><p>But now, Lin Qingbei's strength had risen to this level.</p><p></p><p>This shows just how powerful the divine blood was.</p><p></p><p>If he could fully absorb that divine blood, how much would his dragon qi increase?</p><p></p><p>It would definitely have the potential to break through more than ten dragon veins! Normally, it would take at least a month to cultivate a single dragon vein.</p><p></p><p>Therefore, Ye Xiao was extremely eager for the power within Lin Qingbei's body.</p><p></p><p>The Azure Dragon frowned.</p><p></p><p>"Ye Xiao, there's really no need. Great opportunities also come with tremendous risks. Their strength is too powerful, you'll have a hard time winning."</p><p></p><p>Ye Xiao stared intently at the dark clouds in the sky, his gaze unwavering.</p><p></p><p>"Having a hard time winning doesn't mean I can't win."</p><p></p><p>The Emperor of Scenery had already seen through Ye Xiao's thoughts.</p><p></p><p>Ye Xiao was different from them. They might be able to cultivate to the Emperor Realm in their lifetime, which would already be quite remarkable.</p><p></p><p>To break through to the Divine Realm was as difficult as ascending to the heavens! But Ye Xiao was different, he was the Heavenly Mandate Son chosen by their ancestors.</p><p></p><p>His life could not simply be that of a Martial Emperor.</p><p></p><p>If that were the case, he would be betraying the expectations of so many people.</p><p></p><p>So he had to keep breaking through.</p><p></p><p>The divine blood refined by those hundreds of billions of people was a great opportunity.</p><p></p><p>Thinking about this, the Emperor of Scenery patted Ye Xiao's shoulder.</p><p></p><p>"Go, Ye Xiao. Go do what you want to do!"</p><p></p><p>Ye Xiao nodded, activated the Yin-Yang Escape Art, and instantly pierced through the Great Wall formation.</p><p></p><p>The Azure Dragon couldn't help but worry:</p><p></p><p>"Senior Zhu, letting him charge out like this, isn't it a bit reckless?"</p><p></p><p>The Emperor of Scenery shook his head.</p><p></p><p>"The path of martial dao should be one of unrelenting progress, fearless and unafraid.</p><p></p><p>This child is far stronger than us old fogies. If we restrict his development here, we'll only be harming him.</p><p></p><p>He is a true dragon, and a dragon should soar through the skies, stand above the clouds!"</p><p></p><p>With that, the Emperor of Scenery looked up and watched Ye Xiao's departing figure, silently praying, "Ye Xiao, you must win!"</p><p></p><p>In the sky, Ye Xiao transformed into a golden light, charging into the clouds with the might of thunder.</p><p></p><p>Boom! The dark clouds let out a thunderous roar, with lightning flashing and a majestic aura.</p><p></p><p>Arriving in the clouds, Ye Xiao wasted no words.</p><p></p><p>Against extremely powerful experts, Ye Xiao's usual approach was to simply start killing.</p><p></p><p>The Fissure Star Fist activated, its boundless punch light viciously striking the sky, while a fist the size of a plate also shot out from the clouds with lightning speed.</p><p></p><p>Boom! The collision of the two fists blasted a massive hole in the clouds.</p><p></p><p>Ye Xiao finally saw the opponent's appearance.</p><p></p><p>It was an extremely burly figure, standing at least three meters, nearly four meters tall.</p><p></p><p>His muscular body, shining under the lightning, was like a gleaming steel mirror.</p><p></p><p>He wore a thick black bear pelt, the hide of a super-divine beast, as his defensive armor.</p><p></p><p>Ye Xiao had also previously had a defensive armor, but it had been shattered by dozens of super-divine beasts, and he hadn't had time to repair it yet.</p><p></p><p>Lin Qingbei's gaze was ice-cold and bloodthirsty, his sharp teeth like a bear's, seemingly able to shred anything.</p><p></p><p>After the exchange of one punch, the two scattered. With his Transcendent Body, Ye Xiao didn't need to worry about being injured even without armor.</p><p></p><p>Lin Qingbei looked at him and spoke indifferently:</p><p></p><p>"Unexpectedly, the young master's plan that was three hundred years in the making has been ruined by you.</p><p></p><p>The human race actually produced a talent as monstrous as you! If I hadn't seen it with my own eyes, I probably wouldn't have believed it even now.</p><p> </p><p>I'll pass this on to the young master, but even he might not believe it."</p><p></p><p>Ye Xiao also replied calmly:</p><p></p><p>"The 'young master' you mentioned is the one controlling the beasts in the shadows, isn't he? The history of the beasts dates back over thousands of years, long before the human race appeared in this world.</p><p></p><p>I really want to know who this young master is, to be able to control beasts that have existed for thousands of years."</p><p></p><p>Lin Qingbei's expression remained cold.</p><p></p><p>"The vastness of the starry sky is far beyond your imagination. Although the beasts have existed for a long time, it doesn't mean there is only one starry sky with beasts.</p><p></p><p>The connections are extremely complex.</p><p></p><p>If you want the answers, you'll have to use your fists to force them out.</p><p></p><p>Are your fists strong enough?"</p>

        <h1>Chapter 75</h1>
        <div class="content">
            <p>Here is the full English translation of the Chinese excerpt:</p><p></p><p>Ning Yuhen also came back to work.</p><p></p><p>Everything was just like usual.</p><p></p><p>However, there was a new legend in Jianghai City.</p><p></p><p>It was said that there was a new grand master of martial arts in Jianghai City!</p><p></p><p>This astonishing discovery once again sparked heated discussions among netizens.</p><p></p><p>Many people felt that Jianghai City might have some hidden treasures, or that some rare natural resources were about to emerge, which attracted so many powerful masters! There were countless speculative posts online about this mysterious strong person.</p><p></p><p>Clicking on any of them, you could find some bizarre and gloomy secrets about Jianghai City.</p><p></p><p>What's the reason that the widows' village keeps having pregnant women? What's wrong with the mother pigs that keep howling at night, is it a distortion of human nature or a decline of morality?</p><p></p><p>Why has the rate of non-biological children in Jianghai City been rising, strongly demanding that all the powerful masters come to do paternity tests.</p><p></p><p>In short, any kind of nonsense could be linked to these powerful masters, and the stories were written vividly.</p><p></p><p>If Ye Xiao didn't know that those "high-level figures" were actually himself, he might have been tempted to post something as well.</p><p></p><p>Indeed, keyboard warriors have a lot of guts. After all, on the internet, no one knows who you are, so they can just write whatever they want.</p><p></p><p>With so many people talking about it, the grand masters wouldn't possibly go around killing everyone, right? Besides, if he had the time for that, he'd better find a way to improve himself.</p><p></p><p>After the events of the past few days, Ye Xiao had noticed that there were some conditions to fully unleash the Divine Intention Technique.</p><p></p><p>Although Ye Xiao could now perfectly control the Divine Intention Technique and avoid bumping into things he shouldn't, when the technique was used to the extreme, his skin would feel an intense tearing sensation, as if it was about to be ripped apart.</p><p></p><p>This meant that his physical body still had difficulty withstanding the speed brought by the Divine Intention Technique.</p><p></p><p>After all, the cultivation method forged from the Divine Book was far more powerful than ordinary master-level techniques.</p><p></p><p>The amplification factor had exceeded the limit that his physical body could resist.</p><p></p><p>Even though the Heavenly Restoration Technique could repair the torn skin at any time, the constant tearing would be too painful.</p><p></p><p>Moreover, the bloody and messy appearance was quite at odds with his handsome appearance and slightly chuuni inner self.</p><p></p><p>Therefore, Ye Xiao planned to practice some body tempering techniques in the upcoming period.</p><p></p><p>At the end of the month, the 227th graduation ceremony of the Jianghai City Martial Arts Academy was held.</p><p></p><p>Ye Xiao had no interest in this at all, even if Gu Hai had pestered him to come.</p><p></p><p>But in the end, he still came, because he had heard that a grand master from the Luzhou Shaolin Martial Arts Academy would be attending the graduation ceremony and giving a speech.</p><p></p><p>This kind of thing had almost become a standard practice for small martial arts academies like the Jianghai Martial Arts Academy.</p><p></p><p>It seemed that if they didn't invite a person of status and prestige to give a graduation speech, it would not be considered proper.</p><p></p><p>Ye Xiao came here mainly to see if he could take the opportunity to obtain some basic cultivation techniques.</p><p></p><p>Hearing that all martial arts originated from Shaolin, Shaolin must have many fundamental techniques, which should be relatively easy to acquire.</p><p></p><p>As expected, he did find one.</p><p></p><p>The grand old monk who gave the speech taught a body tempering technique - the Strengthening Tendons and Bones Technique!</p><p></p><p>It was a fundamental body tempering technique passed down in the Shaolin Martial Arts Academy.</p><p></p><p>It had the effects of strengthening the body, significantly enhancing physical abilities, and improving physical flexibility.</p><p></p><p>It was said that the advanced Shaolin body tempering technique was the Sinew Transformation Classic.</p><p></p><p>However, in a place like this, it was obvious that they would not teach that, at most they would only teach a technique like the Strengthening Tendons and Bones Technique.</p><p></p><p>Here is the full English translation of the Chinese excerpt:</p><p></p><p>The disciples who have just entered the Shaolin Monastery practice the cultivation techniques.</p><p></p><p>But this is also quite good.</p><p></p><p>Ye Xiao had previously practiced a bit of body refining techniques, and with the one he learned today, he now has six body refining techniques. It is estimated that it won't be long before he can successfully integrate them.</p><p></p><p>This is already a quite good harvest. Feeling very satisfied.</p><p></p><p>Ga Chang's lecture, few people will listen to it carefully, the disciples of Jianghai Wudao University are far inferior to the top martial arts colleges like Jingdu or Qingda.</p><p></p><p>After the lecture, it was time for the classmates to take group photos to commemorate the occasion.</p><p></p><p>Qin Yuyan and Lu Wanwan were both wearing student uniforms, and Lu Wanwan's belly was already a bit bulging, the button at the navel position of the uniform could no longer be buttoned.</p><p></p><p>Gu Hai was wearing a defense team uniform. This guy punches in at the defense team, and then comes to the academy, ostensibly on duty, but in reality, he is just accompanying his wife to play, this kind of taking advantage of the situation, he has always been quite crafty.</p><p></p><p>However, what Ye Xiao didn't expect was that this guy actually passed the special training camp, and will start the training next month.</p><p></p><p>This is really beyond his expectation.</p><p></p><p>After a simple group photo together, Gu Hai and Lu Wanwan secretly found an opportunity to slip away, leaving only Ye Xiao and Qin Yuyan. Before leaving, Gu Hai even gestured to Ye Xiao.</p><p></p><p>He made a circle with one hand, and then extended one finger with the other hand, stirring a milk tea.</p><p></p><p>Ye Xiao finally understood why Gu Hai had been persuading him so hard to come over before.</p><p></p><p>It turns out he wanted to match make him and Qin Yuyan.</p><p></p><p>He had mentioned this issue before, that Qin Yuyan is a white-rich beauty and also a martial arts genius, with excellent aptitude.</p><p></p><p>If he marries her, he won't have to worry about anything for the rest of his life.</p><p></p><p>Unfortunately, Ye Xiao has no interest in Qin Yuyan at all.</p><p></p><p>It's not that he has any special hobbies.</p><p></p><p>It's just that he's only twenty years old, why should he spend the best years of his life on women? A man should first conquer the world, and when he becomes invincible, what kind of woman can't he find?</p><p></p><p>"Where are Gu Hai and Wanwan?"</p><p></p><p>"I don't know, maybe they went somewhere to take photos."</p><p></p><p>"These two guys actually left us behind."</p><p></p><p>"Maybe they think we are the third wheel."</p><p></p><p>Qin Yuyan sighed helplessly.</p><p></p><p>"Being a single dog is too miserable. Wherever you go, you are looked down upon."</p><p></p><p>Ye Xiao nodded.</p><p></p><p>"After you graduate, will you continue to take the postgraduate exam to cultivate, or find a job?"</p><p></p><p>Qin Yuyan brushed the hair by her ear and said with a faint smile:</p><p></p><p>"I won't take the postgraduate exam anymore, studying hard has always had limited progress. And now, the educational resources in the Nine States are seriously lacking, I plan to take the teacher's appointment exam, stay at the Jianghai Wudao Academy to teach, and contribute to the cultivation of talents for the country."</p><p></p><p>"That's good."</p><p></p><p>This made Ye Xiao's impression of Qin Yuyan a little better.</p><p></p><p>A patriotic person may not necessarily be a good person, but they definitely won't be bad.</p><p></p><p>"By the way, in the future when I teach, I will need books and materials, and I will have to trouble you a lot."</p><p></p><p>"Okay, whatever you need, I'll have Xiao Ning prepare it for you."</p><p></p><p>"Mm!"</p><p></p><p>Just as the two of them finished speaking, a voice suddenly sounded behind Ye Xiao.</p><p></p><p>"Ah! You're here too?"</p>

        <h1>Chapter 200</h1>
        <div class="content">
            <p>Here is the full English translation of the Chinese excerpt:</p><p></p><p>It turned out that as soon as Xia Bingning arrived underground, she encountered the guardian star beasts controlled by Wan Ziqian Hongye.</p><p></p><p>And they were six first-origin sixth-grade great ancestral star beasts! The fragrance and pollen emitted by Wan Ziqian Hongye could confuse the minds of the star beasts, thus controlling them as a means of attack.</p><p></p><p>"Do you need my help?"</p><p></p><p>He communicated with her through his mind.</p><p></p><p>"No need."</p><p></p><p>Xia Bingning tersely spat out three words, with an extremely arrogant tone.</p><p></p><p>Ye Xiao shrugged his shoulders and said no more, continuing to harvest his own flowers.</p><p></p><p>However, he kept a close eye on Xia Bingning below through his mental awareness. Her method of attacking with her eyes piqued his curiosity.</p><p></p><p>It seemed to be another kind of special energy, somewhat like spiritual power, but it could also condense into substance, like extremely dense spiritual power.</p><p></p><p>But it could also attack the opponent unexpectedly.</p><p></p><p>It seemed that as long as it was within her line of sight, the opponent could not escape.</p><p></p><p>And it was very powerful.</p><p></p><p>Could it be a pupil technique? A pupil technique of this world? It seems that after returning, he needs to understand this power.</p><p></p><p>It is not only mysterious, but also very powerful! Underground, in the blink of an eye, the six first-origin sixth-grade star beasts were all resolved by Xia Bingning.</p><p></p><p>Afterwards, she continued to use the earth-traversing technique to descend further.</p><p></p><p>After falling down another distance, the battle became even more intense.</p><p></p><p>This time, the pebbles on the small mountain began to be violently shaken.</p><p></p><p>Ye Xiao continued to dig flowers while using his spiritual power to scan below, and Xia Bingning encountered four first-origin seventh-grade star beasts.</p><p></p><p>However, although the opponent's strength had increased, she was not flustered, and still calmly used her mysterious pupil technique.</p><p></p><p>After a few breaths, she had also killed these four first-origin seventh-grade star beasts.</p><p></p><p>But this time, she was slightly out of breath.</p><p></p><p>"Wan Ziqian Hongye can only confuse and control star beasts of the same cultivation level as itself. Now I have slain the first-origin seventh-grade star beasts, so there should only be one or two first-origin eighth-grade star beasts left.</p><p></p><p>As long as I can defeat them, the only thing left will be the main body of Wan Ziqian Hongye.</p><p></p><p>Although Wan Ziqian Hongye has cultivated to a certain level and evolved divine abilities, I have also found a helper. As long as he doesn't betray me and can help me block Wan Ziqian Hongye's escape route upwards, Wan Ziqian Hongye will definitely not be able to escape from my palm today!"</p><p></p><p>With a slight upward curve of the corners of her mouth, Xia Bingning was in a very good mood.</p><p></p><p>Her cultivation method was different from ordinary people, and she had a great demand for the extremely precious and rare heavenly materials and earthly treasures like Wan Ziqian Hongye.</p><p></p><p>This time, before coming to capture Wan Ziqian Hongye, she had made sufficient preparations and investigations.</p><p></p><p>She had full confidence that she would be able to subdue Wan Ziqian Hongye.</p><p></p><p>This was her confidence in her own strength! A natural spirit pupil!</p><p></p><p>At the age of twenty-one, she had already entered the first-origin eighth-grade, and her pupil technique was played out extraordinarily. Within the same realm, there was absolutely no one who could match her.</p><p></p><p>But this was not the most important thing, the most important thing was that she came from that place!</p><p></p><p>The one who came to the surface from that place had means far more powerful than the warriors of this world.</p><p></p><p>This was the gap between dimensions. She came to this world, purely to strike down from a higher dimension!</p><p></p><p>With the same first-origin eighth-grade strength, she could absolutely defeat the opponent. On the surface world, she was unrivaled within her realm. Unrivaled within the same realm, and even able to contend with those above her realm! This was her self-confidence, her backing.</p><p></p><p>The earth-traversing technique was activated again, and her body descended to an even deeper layer of the area.</p><p></p><p>As soon as she arrived here, her eyes lit up.</p><p></p><p>In the darkness, a strange flower with eight colorful stripes was blooming and emitting multicolored light.</p><p></p><p>Like the radiance of a fairy, mysterious and irresistibly alluring.</p><p></p><p>In fact, it was not light, but the power that had been condensed to the extreme after the too dense spiritual energy had been externalized.</p><p></p><p>"I've found you, Wan Ziqian Hongye."</p><p></p><p>Wan Ziqian Hongye had spiritual awareness, and as if responding to her, the light on its body flickered twice.</p><p></p><p>The next moment, two extremely powerful spiritual energy fluctuations appeared in the darkness.</p><p></p><p>They were first-origin eighth-grade star beasts, their cultivation level almost on par with hers.</p><p></p><p>"As expected! My guess was correct, there would still be two first-origin eighth-grade star beasts in the end."</p><p></p><p>She was not afraid, because she had such battle experience, and with her powerful pupil technique, it was not a difficult task to fight against two first-origin eighth-grade star beasts at the same time.</p><p></p><p>This battle, she would win steadily.</p><p></p><p>Wan Ziqian Hongye would also be captured in her palm.</p><p></p><p>On the surface, Ye Xiao had almost finished harvesting all the spiritual flowers around him, and his spiritual power was transmitted down again.</p><p></p><p>"There are first-origin eighth-grade star beasts, are you sure you don't need help?"</p><p></p><p>"No need! Although I say so, you may find it hard to believe, but a mere two eighth-grade star beasts are not a big deal to me."</p><p></p><p>Taking a deep breath, her bright eyes began to emit a heart-pounding light again.</p><p></p><p>Boom! The next moment, an explosion suddenly rang out.</p><p></p><p>But it was not the two first-origin eighth-grade star beasts in front.</p><p></p><p>It was Xia Bingning.</p><p></p><p>"Pu-chi!" </p><p></p><p>She spat out a mouthful of scarlet blood, and a sharp pain and burning sensation came from her back, making her head a little dizzy.</p><p></p><p>What's going on? Where did the attack come from? Just as she was completely bewildered, the attack in front suddenly...</p><p></p><p>Here is the full English translation of the Chinese novel excerpt:</p><p></p><p>The attack came.</p><p></p><p>Xia Bingning did not dare to be careless. Her combat power could handle two opponents at once, but that was just her combat power! Her defensive power was no different from an ordinary Innate Eighth-Grade expert.</p><p></p><p>Tanking this move head-on would undoubtedly result in injury. She dared not be the slightest bit careless, and immediately activated her eye technique to forcibly shift her position, evading the attack.</p><p></p><p>However, at that moment, two more attacks no weaker than Innate Eighth-Grade came down on her.</p><p></p><p>Boom, boom.</p><p></p><p>"Pu-chi!"</p><p></p><p>Xia Bingning coughed up blood again, her complexion becoming withered. Even her bright, large eyes had dimmed considerably.</p><p></p><p>And she finally saw the truth of the situation.</p><p></p><p>There were not just two Innate Eighth-Grade spirit beasts here, but a full six of them!</p><p></p><p>This Wan Zi Qian Hong Ye had hidden his final trump card here.</p><p></p><p>She had been careless, blinded by overconfidence, and fallen into the enemy's trap.</p><p></p><p>It was over now, there was no way she could catch Wan Zi Qian Hong Ye anymore. Survival was the priority.</p><p></p><p>She immediately bit her finger, using her own fresh blood in conjunction with the power of her eye technique to form a short-range spatial transfer.</p><p></p><p>In an instant, she jumped out of the encirclement.</p><p></p><p>"Flee!"</p><p></p><p>Then, she ran towards the ground at maximum speed.</p><p></p><p>Wan Zi Qian Hong Ye obviously would not let her go so easily.</p><p></p><p>Colorful light flashed on the flower's body, and in the next moment, all the Innate Eighth-Grade spirit beasts charged up with incredible speed.</p><p></p><p>They were shrouded in a faint rainbow glow, as if they had received Wan Zi Qian Hong Ye's assistance, and their speed in the soil was terrifyingly fast.</p><p></p><p>In the blink of an eye, they had caught up to Xia Bingning at a visible speed.</p><p></p><p>Xia Bingning's already pale face instantly became even paler.</p><p></p><p>"Damn it!"</p><p></p><p>She spat, filled with terror. At this moment, she desperately wished someone could come and help her.</p><p></p><p>But she knew, there was no one who could.</p><p></p><p>Ye Xiao's strength was not bad, but he was definitely no match for her enemies. How could she expect him to save her? And even if his strength was enough, without earth-traversing techniques, how could he come down to help her?</p><p></p><p>Ye Xiao, who had just finished digging up all the spirit flowers, sensed Xia Bingning's situation and was not particularly surprised.</p><p></p><p>Because from the beginning, he had sensed that there were six Innate Eighth-Grade spirit beasts below.</p><p></p><p>It's just that this Xia Bingning was too arrogant, so he didn't say anything.</p><p></p><p>He had originally thought that Xia Bingning, with her extraordinary eye techniques, could at least hold out for a while.</p><p></p><p>But he didn't expect her to surrender so quickly.</p><p></p><p>Ye Xiao packed up all the flowers and stored them in his spatial ring, then immediately used the earth-traversing technique, disappearing into the ground in an instant.</p><p></p><p>Xia Bingning, who was rushing towards the ground, suddenly saw Ye Xiao descending, and was startled.</p><p></p><p>"You know the earth-traversing technique? Why didn't you say so earlier?"</p><p></p><p>"You didn't ask me. And I didn't offer to help you. I thought you could handle it."</p><p></p><p>Xia Bingning felt her cheeks burning, but she quickly regained her composure and said, "The plan has changed, let's retreat! We are no match for them."</p><p></p><p>But Ye Xiao did not listen to her, but brushed past her and charged straight towards the six Innate Eighth-Grade spirit beasts below.</p><p></p><p>"Are you crazy?"</p><p></p><p>Xia Bingning couldn't help but shout.</p><p></p><p>After all, it was not just one or two, but a full six Innate Eighth-Grade spirit beasts of the Divine Ancestor realm.</p><p></p><p>As the saying goes, "Two fists are no match for four hands."</p><p></p><p>Even she, a genius with a natural spiritual eye, could at most single-handedly fight two opponents of the same level.</p><p></p><p>Facing these six Innate Eighth-Grade spirit beasts, she had no choice but to choose a tactical retreat.</p><p></p><p>But he, he actually charged in directly.</p><p></p><p>This guy must be insane!</p><p></p><p>Ye Xiao's speed was fast, and the opponents' speed was also fast. The two sides met in an instant.</p><p></p><p>Xia Bingning looked back, ready to witness the tragic scene.</p><p></p><p>But in the next second, she was petrified! She saw Ye Xiao, in the moment before the two sides collided, suddenly clenched his fist and struck out.</p><p></p><p>Great Silence Fist!</p><p></p><p>The powerful fist force slammed into the first spirit beast, directly blasting its body to pieces.</p><p></p><p>One-shot kill!</p><p></p><p>Then the second Innate Eighth-Grade spirit beast charged in, and Ye Xiao casually waved his hand, unleashing a sword beam.</p><p></p><p>Tyrannical Sword!</p><p></p><p>The sword beam flashed, startling even ghosts and gods, illuminating the entire underground with golden light.</p><p></p><p>Pu-chi! One slash.</p><p></p><p>With just a light stroke, another Innate Eighth-Grade Divine Ancestor spirit beast was cleaved in half, as easily as cutting through cotton.</p>

        <h1>Chapter 42</h1>
        <div class="content">
            <p>Here is the full English translation of the Chinese excerpt:</p><p></p><p>"Liuli is a first-grade innate cultivator, and her recovery time is about 5 seconds. I am a third-grade innate cultivator, and my recovery time is around 20 seconds."</p><p></p><p>The power levels are divided into grades, and each grade is roughly double the previous one! That's how Ye Xiao estimated his own healing time when injured!</p><p></p><p>However, this healing time will gradually increase as one's cultivation improves.</p><p></p><p>It's not too bad when the level is low, but when the level gets higher, it becomes very disadvantageous in battles.</p><p></p><p>Indeed, what's free is always the worst!</p><p></p><p>"Hopefully, the effect will be a bit better after the fusion."</p><p></p><p>...</p><p></p><p>The night passed quickly, and the next day, Ye Xiao got up and went to work as usual.</p><p></p><p>Just as he bought breakfast near the library, a defense squad vehicle stopped by the roadside, and the window rolled down, revealing Gu Hai's anxious face.</p><p></p><p>"Old Ye! Over here."</p><p></p><p>Ye Xiao walked over with a bun in his hand. Gu Hai leaned out and grabbed a vegetable bun, taking a big bite.</p><p></p><p>"I'm starving, let me have a bite first before I say anything."</p><p></p><p>Ye Xiao glanced over and noticed that Gu Hai was fully equipped, feeling a sense of unease.</p><p></p><p>"What's going on? You're dressed so formally. You've only been on the job for a few days, and you're already going on a mission?"</p><p></p><p>"That's right. Do you remember the case from a few days ago?"</p><p></p><p>"The soul transmission?"</p><p></p><p>"Yes, that one. The expert in the defense squad used a spiritual search technique to locate the source and confirm the position. We're about to head over there."</p><p></p><p>A member of the defense squad next to him patted his shoulder.</p><p></p><p>"You little rascal, this is a confidential operation. Don't go blabbing around."</p><p></p><p>Gu Hai waved his hand.</p><p></p><p>"It's fine, Old Ye is one of us."</p><p></p><p>He then took two more buns from Ye Xiao's bag and handed one to him.</p><p></p><p>"Here, stuff your face."</p><p></p><p>"Screw you."</p><p></p><p>The other person laughed and took the bun, starting to eat it.</p><p></p><p>Ye Xiao frowned and said, "It's your first mission, be careful. If the opponent can use spiritual techniques, their cultivation must be quite high."</p><p></p><p>"Don't worry, we in the defense squad are no pushovers. I'm off. Let's have a drink when I get back."</p><p></p><p>"Alright, stay safe."</p><p></p><p>Gu Hai chuckled, closed the car window, and drove off.</p><p></p><p>Ye Xiao felt a sense of unease in his heart, so he released a thread of spiritual power to track Gu Hai's location. If Gu Hai ran into trouble, at least Ye Xiao would know where to find him.</p><p></p><p>Afterwards, Ye Xiao entered the library, clocked in, and continued to practice his healing techniques.</p><p></p><p>Two days quickly passed.</p><p></p><p>Ye Xiao had found two more healing techniques, reaching a total of seven basic healing techniques, and his healing speed had improved slightly, but it was still not time for the fusion.</p><p></p><p>Ye Xiao estimated that the healing technique fusion would require nine to ten basic healing techniques to achieve.</p><p></p><p>But it didn't really matter.</p><p></p><p>As a carefree person, he wasn't in a hurry.</p><p></p><p>It was his friend Gu Hai who had been on the mission and hadn't contacted him since then.</p><p></p><p>Thinking about it, the mastermind behind the scenes who wanted to target Jianghai City couldn't have gone too far from Jianghai City, but Ye Xiao had no way to ask about this. He considered calling Lu Wanwan, but he didn't have her phone number.</p><p></p><p>As for visiting her in person, that would be inappropriate, as Gu Hai was out on a mission, and Ye Xiao just showing up at his house would be like... a friend's wife? No, that wouldn't be right.</p><p></p><p>Ye Xiao didn't think too much about it and decided to wait and see.</p><p></p><p>After all, Gu Hai was a member of the defense squad, so if something happened to the squad, they would surely notify the families.</p><p></p><p>Time flew by, and two more days passed. It was Friday evening after work.</p><p></p><p>Tomorrow, Saturday, would be Old Wang's grandson's one-month celebration.</p><p></p><p>Gu Hai still hadn't contacted him.</p><p></p><p>But just as Ye Xiao was leaving work, his phone rang. It wasn't Gu Hai, but Qin Yuyao.</p><p>She had borrowed books from him before, so they had each other's contact information.</p><p></p><p>Here is the full English translation of the Chinese excerpt:</p><p></p><p>"Hello."</p><p></p><p>Ye Xiao answered the phone, and Qin Yuyan immediately spoke up on the other end:</p><p></p><p>"Hello, Ye Xiao, have you gotten off work yet?"</p><p></p><p>"I just got off, what's the matter?"</p><p></p><p>"It's nothing much, I just wanted to ask you, have Gu Hai called you these past few days?"</p><p></p><p>"No. Has he not contacted Wan Wan either?"</p><p></p><p>"No."</p><p></p><p>"What did the defense team say?"</p><p></p><p>"The defense team said they've entered the deep mountains for combat, the signal is poor, so they can't contact him for now. But the defense team has already sent the second wave of troops to search for him."</p><p></p><p>"Then it shouldn't be a big deal, tell Wan Wan not to worry too much, she's still pregnant, her health is the priority."</p><p></p><p>"Mm. I'll keep her company here tonight, if you're free, could you bring me a few books about swordsmanship?"</p><p></p><p>"I have some matters to attend to at the moment, but I'll have Huan Liuli bring them over to you, it knows the way to the Gu Hai family's place."</p><p></p><p>"Thank you then."</p><p></p><p>"You're welcome."</p><p></p><p>After hanging up the phone, Ye Xiao sighed lightly, found a few books about swordsmanship, and had Huan Liuli send them over.</p><p></p><p>He then returned home and began to seclude himself in cultivation.</p><p></p><p>He vaguely felt that he was about to break through.</p><p></p><p>The time since his last breakthrough was not long, but the time spent between Grandmaster and Great Grandmaster, and between Great Grandmaster and Divine Grandmaster, was actually not long.</p><p></p><p>What was needed for advancement was just an opportunity! The previous two ranks had already accumulated enough spiritual energy in his body.</p><p></p><p>The difference between the third and fourth ranks was no longer a matter of quantity, but of quality!</p><p></p><p>If he could find the opportunity, he could easily step into the Great Grandmaster realm.</p><p></p><p>But this level of opportunity was as difficult as ascending to the heavens!</p><p></p><p>How many Grandmasters were there in the world? How many could enter the Great Grandmaster realm? If it was said that Grandmasters were one in ten thousand, then Great Grandmasters were one in a million!</p><p></p><p>In the Jianghai City, there were only three Grandmasters, and no Great Grandmasters. Figures like the Two Horses and the One King, whose businesses spanned the Nine Provinces, were enough to demonstrate the immense power of Great Grandmasters! Unfortunately, after cultivating for half a day until deep into the night, Ye Xiao still had not achieved any results.</p><p></p><p>"Still lacking a bit?" Ye Xiao couldn't help but raise his eyebrows slightly.</p><p></p><p>After all, the Great Grandmaster realm was not something that could be easily attained. If it were that easy, there would be Great Grandmasters everywhere.</p><p></p><p>This was also why Ye Xiao had a more relaxed personality. If it were someone else, they would have probably gotten anxious and impatient long ago.</p><p></p><p>Ye Xiao was able to think clearly. </p><p></p><p>Being anxious wouldn't help.</p><p></p><p>If it were useful, this world would already be filled with Great Grandmasters everywhere.</p><p></p><p>Huan Liuli had already returned and was sleeping on the sofa. Ye Xiao shook his head and was about to lie down to rest when his phone screen suddenly lit up.</p><p></p><p>It was a text message from Gu Hai.</p><p></p><p>Ye Xiao opened the message, and his expression couldn't help but become more serious.</p><p></p><p>"Old Ye, I may not be able to come back. We encountered an ambush, the enemy is too numerous.</p><p></p><p>Don't tell Wan Wan.</p><p></p><p>I know it's selfish of me to send you this message, but you're the only good friend I have.</p><p></p><p>If I really can't come back, please help me take care of my parents. I'm an only child, and they have no one to look after them.</p><p></p><p>As for Wan Wan, you tell her to not keep the child. With a bottle of soy sauce, her life is over, what man would still want her? My survivor's benefits, the defense team should give it directly to my family, you don't need to spend money, just go visit them occasionally.</p><p></p><p>I don't know what else to say, time's up, they're coming up @%&*%&."</p><p></p><p>(Chapter end)</p>

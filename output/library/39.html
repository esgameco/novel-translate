        <h1>Chapter 39</h1>
        <div class="content">
            <p>Here is the full English translation of the Chinese excerpt:</p><p></p><p>Gu Hai quickly called his wife Lu Wanwan's phone, but when Lu Wanwan heard that he had spent a few thousand on a single meal, she exploded right then and there! "What? A few thousand? Are you eating or getting a foot massage? Did you go to the Red Romance again?"</p><p></p><p>"Hello, wife, I really didn't go to the Red Romance, I was eating with Ye Xiao."</p><p></p><p>"What kind of meal costs a few thousand? Do you think I'm an idiot?"</p><p></p><p>"It's true! If you don't believe me, I'll video call you."</p><p></p><p>One minute later.</p><p></p><p>"Gu Hai, you heartless bastard, I've always wanted to try that seafood buffet but you went with Ye Xiao without taking me. And you even want me to pay for it? Go to hell!"</p><p></p><p>With that, Lu Wanwan hung up the phone.</p><p></p><p>Gu Hai: "..."</p><p></p><p>The waitress next to him was covering her mouth, trying to hold back her laughter until her face turned purple.</p><p></p><p>Gu Hai said irritably:</p><p></p><p>"Are you laughing at me? Be careful, I'll file a complaint against you!"</p><p></p><p>The waitress suppressed her laughter and said seriously:</p><p></p><p>"Sir, we have been trained strictly, and no matter how funny it is, we will not laugh."</p><p></p><p>But the corner of her mouth still curled up in a slight smile.</p><p></p><p>"You're still laughing!"</p><p></p><p>"This is just a polite smile. And sir, don't change the subject, please just pay the bill."</p><p></p><p>Gu Hai looked at Ye Xiao, who turned his head away, clearly not wanting to get involved.</p><p></p><p>He was helpless, he couldn't really count on Illusion Jade the cat, could he?</p><p></p><p>Resigned, he opened his phone case, took out a few hundred, then took off his shoes, took out a thousand from the insoles, then took a few hundred from his socks and a few hundred from his sleeves. Just as he was about to unbuckle his belt, the waitress's face turned green.</p><p></p><p>Fortunately, Gu Hai's money was in the belt pouch, not that area, otherwise she might have really vomited.</p><p></p><p>Even so, the money stuffed in his shoes still had a sour, musty smell, making the waitress pick it up with two fingers and throw it to the front desk in disgust.</p><p></p><p>"Hey, remember to give me a receipt."</p><p></p><p>"Got it!"</p><p></p><p>Ye Xiao grinned and said:</p><p></p><p>"Didn't expect you to have a mini-vault hidden on your body like this."</p><p></p><p>"Of course! A married man has to learn some treasure-hiding skills, right? But you really dug a hole for me today, if I run out of money in the future, you better not hide it from me."</p><p></p><p>Ye Xiao nodded.</p><p></p><p>"If there's nothing else, I'll head back first. Wanwan must be furious, I'll have to face the music at home."</p><p></p><p>"Can you handle it?"</p><p></p><p>"Of course! I still have two hundred in my pocket, I'll buy her some snacks to smooth things over in no time."</p><p></p><p>"Eat less snacks, it's not good for the baby."</p><p></p><p>"Got it."</p><p></p><p>The two exchanged a few more pleasantries and parted ways at the restaurant entrance.</p><p></p><p>As Ye Xiao walked back, he was lost in thought.</p><p></p><p>It wasn't about Aer King.</p><p></p><p>Aer King's situation was a complete mystery, and there was no clue to follow, so thinking about it would just be a waste of brain cells.</p><p></p><p>What he was thinking about was the ability of that star beast that could continuously divide its spiritual power and contaminate the soul. Could this be applied to his own sword techniques or blade techniques?</p><p></p><p>Upon closer inspection, his blade and sword techniques were all based on straight-line attacks.</p><p></p><p>Although they were very powerful, they couldn't curve around. And there were also limitations on their release distance - they couldn't go on forever.</p><p></p><p>Here is the full English translation of the Chinese excerpt:</p><p></p><p>To be able to run hundreds or even thousands of miles away! The methods by which others' spiritual power infects the soul are so deadly that just a brush would kill, and a touch would injure. Once locked on, there is no escape.</p><p></p><p>Now that I have cultivated the profound Tian Gang spiritual power technique, can I compress the power of a blade technique or sword technique, and then control it with spiritual power to track and trigger a remote detonation? Or through other means, deliver it thousands of miles away, and still use spiritual power to detect, judge, and detonate it.</p><p></p><p>In that case, would I be able to take someone's head from thousands of miles away? Ye Xiao has always been a person who acts on his thoughts!</p><p></p><p>He brought the Illusion Jade and came to the suburbs outside of Jiang City, gently stroking the little head of the Illusion Jade.</p><p></p><p>"Illusion Jade, I've subdued you for so long, how have I treated you?"</p><p></p><p>Illusion Jade's heart skipped a beat.</p><p></p><p>"Master... um, Master has treated me quite well! What's wrong?"</p><p></p><p>"I want you to help me test out the technique I just thought of."</p><p></p><p>Illusion Jade's body suddenly shivered.</p><p></p><p>"Master, you're not joking with me, are you? Your attacks are so strong that with just one move, I'd be done for. How can I test it?"</p><p></p><p>"Don't worry, I'll control the force carefully, only releasing a tiny bit of power, and won't hurt you."</p><p></p><p>"Can I refuse?"</p><p></p><p>"Of course you can, I'm a humane master, and I greatly respect my star pet."</p><p></p><p>As he said this, Ye Xiao's hand stroking Illusion Jade's head became increasingly forceful.</p><p></p><p>Illusion Jade trembled.</p><p></p><p>"Master, stop petting me, my fur is going to be rubbed off! I'll help you test it."</p><p></p><p>"Good child, just run forward as you please, run wherever you want. Use your full speed, no need to hold back."</p><p></p><p>"That's it?"</p><p></p><p>"Yes."</p><p></p><p>"Then don't blame me."</p><p></p><p>With that, Illusion Jade transformed into a black lightning bolt and shot out.</p><p></p><p>"Haha, you really think I'm an idiot? You want me to let you practice on me? Dream on! I'm going to run a hundred and eighty kilometers away, have a good time in the neighboring city, and then come back."</p><p></p><p>Behind her, Ye Xiao exhaled a heavy breath, watching the fleeing Illusion Jade, the corners of his mouth slightly upturned.</p><p></p><p>The next moment, he slowly extended his right hand and unleashed the Heavenly Slash.</p><p></p><p>In an instant, a dazzling sword beam quickly formed, then was compressed into a small, thumb-sized light particle.</p><p></p><p>Afterwards, Ye Xiao infused it with his spiritual power, setting the spiritual power to detonate directly at Illusion Jade the moment it detected her. Once the settings were complete, the sword beam flew in the direction Illusion Jade had fled.</p><p></p><p>The speed was astonishing, like a shooting star, disappearing into the darkness in the blink of an eye, and catching up to the rapidly running Illusion Jade.</p><p></p><p>The smugly running Illusion Jade, the next moment, a sword beam like a meteor streaked across, suddenly exploding on the grass in front of her.</p><p></p><p>"Boom!"</p><p></p><p>A thunderous roar, flames shooting into the sky, the shockwave directly blasting Illusion Jade into the air.</p><p></p><p>After landing, she opened her mouth wide, staring fixatedly at the endless darkness behind her, gulping down a mouthful of saliva, the entire cat terrified to the extreme! Behind her, in that boundless darkness, it was as if a unseen, yet overwhelmingly powerful primordial behemoth was lurking, ready to swallow her at any moment.</p><p></p><p>(End of chapter)</p>

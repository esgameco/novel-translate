        <h1>Chapter 202</h1>
        <div class="content">
            <p>Here is the full English translation of the Chinese excerpt:</p><p></p><p>Even for a martial artist, it would not be easy to move around freely in this place.</p><p></p><p>So he could easily find a hiding place.</p><p></p><p>A cave of a primordial second-grade Sect Master realm Raging Bear Star Beast.</p><p></p><p>The Raging Bear definitely wouldn't be willing, so Ye Xiao nailed it at the cave entrance as a specimen.</p><p></p><p>Then Ye Xiao took out half a Myriad Purple Thousand Red Leaf.</p><p></p><p>Although it was only half, the spiritual energy power contained within it was so rich that Ye Xiao couldn't help but smack his lips in amazement.</p><p></p><p>In fact, the Myriad Purple Thousand Red Leaf not only contained powerful spiritual energy, but also a large amount of mental power.</p><p></p><p>The Flower King is indeed the Flower King.</p><p></p><p>If you want to replenish, replenish everything, develop comprehensively and maintain balanced nutrition.</p><p></p><p>Damn it!</p><p></p><p>Although those Star Beasts were cultivated by the Myriad Purple Thousand Red Leaf, at their core, they were at least primordial seventh-grade as a foundation, in order to reach the primordial eighth-grade realm.</p><p></p><p>In addition to their blood qi and star cores, this medicinal pill, even before it was refined, Ye Xiao already felt it was absolutely extraordinary.</p><p></p><p>Without further delay, he immediately began to refine the medicinal pill.</p><p></p><p>Myriad into one, he started to purify all the materials and remove the impurities within.</p><p></p><p>Soon, streams of extremely pure golden-colored energy began to condense together.</p><p></p><p>Accompanied by Ye Xiao's continuous compression, their color gradually deepened.</p><p></p><p>In the end, a faint purple glow began to appear.</p><p></p><p>The medicinal pill started to tremble.</p><p></p><p>This was not a failure in refining the medicinal pill, but rather, under Ye Xiao's constant compression, this extremely powerful energy, due to being condensed too deeply, had its mental power and blood qi fused together, developing self-awareness, wanting to resist and break free from Ye Xiao's control.</p><p></p><p>This had already transcended the realm of ordinary Emperor Elixirs!</p><p></p><p>Ordinary Emperor Elixirs, even if refined using primordial sixth-grade Star Beasts, could still be refined.</p><p></p><p>But now, Ye Xiao used a total of four cultivated primordial eighth-grade Star Beasts, whose actual blood qi was equivalent to primordial seventh-grade, and added half a Myriad Purple Thousand Red Leaf to refine it.</p><p></p><p>The energy contained within was countless times more than that of a primordial sixth-grade Star Beast! If it could break free from Ye Xiao's methods, relying on its own massive mental power and blood qi, it still had the opportunity to become a brand new and extremely powerful life form.</p><p></p><p>If it were other alchemists, even the most extraordinary ones, they would probably not be able to withstand it.</p><p></p><p>But Ye Xiao was different.</p><p></p><p>He was not just an alchemist, refining elixirs was just a sideline for him.</p><p></p><p>His true identity was an extremely powerful martial artist.</p><p></p><p>The power in this medicinal pill was not enough to break through his seals and escape his control.</p><p></p><p>Seeing the super disobedient, massive mental power and blood qi in the palm of his hand, Ye Xiao directly used the Taixuan Tiangong to ruthlessly shatter it!</p><p></p><p>When the cohesive mental power was shattered, without the mental power, its blood qi naturally lost its backbone and was suppressed by Ye Xiao's spiritual energy, no matter how much it wanted to rebel, it was powerless.</p><p></p><p>But soon, as Ye Xiao continued to refine the medicinal pill, the massive mental power gathered again, wanting to lead the blood qi to attack Ye Xiao.</p><p></p><p>Unfortunately, it was met with another heavy blow from Ye Xiao, the Taixuan Tiangong, which shattered it again.</p><p></p><p>Then the third time, the fourth time, the fifth time, each time Ye Xiao was merciless, ruthlessly shattering it without any reason.</p><p></p><p>The brutality and mercilessness of his methods were probably unprecedented in the entire history of elixir refinement.</p><p></p><p>In fact, apart from Ye Xiao having this level of ability, others trying to use such methods would not have this level of skill! Primordial eighth-grade alchemists were already extremely rare and precious existences in this world, rarer than giant pandas.</p><p></p><p>Finally, after experiencing Ye Xiao's countless unreasonable attacks and suppression, the medicinal pill was finally formed.</p><p></p><p>It no longer resisted, but instead spun around in the palm of Ye Xiao's hand.</p><p></p><p>It was now early morning of the next day, a time when all things should be enjoying the tranquility and peace.</p><p></p><p>Suddenly, a thunderous crack echoed, causing the Star Beasts in the forest to tremble uncontrollably.</p><p></p><p>The ones who had just experienced a tribulation the night before had not even had a chance to rest, and were now shaken again.</p><p></p><p>Ye Xiao was not afraid, he knew that whenever an extraordinary item appeared, the power of the rules above seemed to always come down to join in the excitement.</p><p></p><p>The first time he might feel shocked, but the second, third, and subsequent times, he had long since gotten used to it.</p><p></p><p>The lightning struck the cave, tearing it open, and then struck directly above Ye Xiao's head, but it was unable to break through the Tiangong qi above his head.</p><p></p><p>Ye Xiao couldn't be bothered to deal with this tribulation, and directly swallowed the medicinal pill.</p><p></p><p>Boom! In an instant, a power so powerful that it reached the limit of what he could bear erupted within his body.</p><p></p><p>This power was so strong and abundant that it directly filled his internal organs to the extreme, then frantically attacked his blood vessels and even his entire physical body.</p><p></p><p>His soul also suffered a violent impact, becoming unruly and starting to tremble.</p><p></p><p>Just like a breached dam, the raging flood could not be stopped!</p><p></p><p>However, Ye Xiao was completely unfazed, the Golden Book emitting a strong light to protect his soul.</p><p></p><p>As long as his soul...</p><p></p><p>Here is the full English translation of the Chinese excerpt:</p><p></p><p>His physical body is indestructible, and his spirit and will are indestructible. His physical form will be eternal.</p><p></p><p>All the cultivation techniques were like different colored light wheels spinning rapidly within his body, frantically devouring and digesting this power.</p><p></p><p>The fierce spiritual energy and mental power were instantly forcibly locked and channeled by the cultivation techniques, then turned around to transform the heavens and earth, converted into Ye Xiao's own power. They began to endlessly repair and strengthen his body, elevating his originally only Xiantian Eighth Rank physique to an even stronger level!</p><p></p><p>The aura gradually began to rise from Ye Xiao's dantian, a completely new aura that surpassed his previous aura.</p><p></p><p>Ye Xiao spread out his hands, allowing the thunderbolts to strike his body.</p><p></p><p>He did not use any protective spiritual energy, nor did he activate the Indestructible Divine Skill. He simply used his physical body to withstand the thunderbolts!</p><p></p><p>A Xiantian Ninth Rank expert was undergoing the tribulation lightning, bathing in the baptism of the thunderbolts.</p><p></p><p>Like a phoenix reborn from the flames, tearing apart his previous Xiantian Eighth Rank weakness, revealing his even more vigorous vitality!</p><p></p><p>Time passed minute by minute, it was 9 o'clock in the morning, and in Jianghai City, an exciting confrontation was also taking place.</p><p></p><p>Shaolin's Fa Zheng was facing off against the Buddhist disciple Aluo from India.</p><p></p><p>Both of them had the strength of great masters, but they were still not as strong as Ye Xiao's two roses who had defeated Liu Chengxun and Murakami Hitoshi.</p><p></p><p>But for a place like Jianghai City, where most martial artists were not particularly strong, their battle was still a match worth watching.</p><p></p><p>The brilliance of the battle was indescribable in a few words. The entire audience was given one surprise after another, shocked time and again.</p><p></p><p>Aluo's techniques were more tricky, but they were also orthodox Buddhist techniques. His footwork was ethereal, dazzling the eyes.</p><p></p><p>Fa Zheng's techniques were thick and mighty. Although his speed was not as fast as Aluo's, he was like a great mountain, firm as a rock, repeatedly repelling Aluo's attacks, earning continuous admiration.</p><p></p><p>The two of them fought for nearly half an hour, until after a final exchange of palms, their physical strength was completely exhausted, and they could no longer continue the battle.</p><p></p><p>"Amitabha, this round ends in a draw!"</p><p></p><p>Witnessed by the elders of the Shaolin and Indian Buddhist sects, the confrontation ended in a draw.</p><p></p><p>Thunderous applause echoed through the venue.</p><p></p><p>Aluo couldn't help but sigh:</p><p></p><p>"This is truly a miraculous land of the Nine Provinces. Even after so many years, miracles can still occur.</p><p></p><p>In this round, I was lucky to achieve a draw.</p><p>If I had been a little careless, I might have truly lost."</p><p></p><p>Fa Zheng smiled and said, "Fellow Daoist is too humble. My defense relies entirely on my cultivation technique, but I have not yet fully mastered it. When I unleash it, there are still flaws, and it was Aluo Fellow Daoist's forbearance that allowed me to achieve a draw."</p><p></p><p>Aluo shook his head.</p><p></p><p>"It's not a matter of forbearance. Your defense is indeed the strongest among our generation of Buddhist disciples.</p><p>Combined with your cultivation technique, it is almost perfect.</p><p>Moreover, your cultivation technique is not yet fully mastered, but it is already so powerful. If you truly master it, I'm afraid I won't even be able to achieve a draw."</p><p></p><p>Suddenly, an unexpected event occurred.</p><p></p><p>In the sky, a dark cloud layer suddenly surged forth, like a huge black mountain pressing down, its terrifying aura even causing all the martial artists present, and the entire Jianghai City, to feel a tightness in their chests and difficulty breathing.</p><p></p><p>"What is that?"</p><p>"Is it a thundercloud?"</p><p>"No, the weather forecast didn't say it would rain today."</p><p></p><p>However, Fa Zheng, Aluo, and the other experts of Jianghai City, upon seeing that dark, oppressive cloud, had grave expressions on their faces.</p><p></p><p>"Such an evil aura, how can it be so thick and malevolent?"</p><p>"Could it be someone from an evil sect?"</p><p></p><p>Just as the crowd was perplexed, the elder Changfeng suddenly received a phone call.</p><p></p><p>"What? Half-beasts? Many half-beasts? How is that possible? Where did these half-beasts come from?"</p><p></p><p>Hearing this, the expressions of everyone present became even more grim, and many began to panic.</p>

        <h1>Chapter 267</h1>
        <div class="content">
            <p>Here is the full English translation of the Chinese excerpt:</p><p></p><p>Huan Liuli curiously examined Beitang Ce.</p><p></p><p>Beitang Ce glanced at Huan Liuli and couldn't help but be slightly surprised.</p><p></p><p>"This is... a Xiantianseven-grade Shenzong-level spirit beast? Mr. Ye, you actually happen to be a beast tamer as well?"</p><p></p><p>Ye Xiao shook his head.</p><p></p><p>"I'm not a beast tamer, I just took her on as a subordinate to help me with things, so that's why I took her in originally."</p><p></p><p>After saying that, Ye Xiao turned to Huan Liuri and said:</p><p></p><p>"Go prepare a sumptuous dinner, I'm going to have dinner with a friend tonight."</p><p></p><p>"It's already been prepared, just waiting for the master to come back and eat."</p><p></p><p>Huan Liuli immediately ran inside to bring out the dishes.</p><p></p><p>Beitang Ce couldn't help but sigh in admiration:</p><p></p><p>"Mr. Ye is truly remarkable, to even be able to get a Xiantian seven-grade Shenzong spirit beast to serve as a slave. </p><p></p><p>This level of ability truly impresses this old man."</p><p></p><p>Although he had already reached Xiantian nine-grade cultivation, and could easily defeat a Xiantian seven-grade spirit beast, even to the point of killing it in an instant, it was extremely difficult for him to get such a high-level spirit beast to serve under him.</p><p></p><p>As the saying goes, the wild is hard to tame, and spirit beasts of their level are all proud and arrogant, absolutely unwilling to obey your commands just because your cultivation is higher.</p><p></p><p>Unless you captured them when they were young and gradually trained them up.</p><p></p><p>But that would take an extremely long time and cost, which is not very worthwhile.</p><p></p><p>After all, even for dragon-level bloodlines, it would take several hundred years, or even close to a thousand years, to rise from having no cultivation at all in childhood to reaching the Shenzong realm.</p><p></p><p>"Mr. Ye, do you have any miraculous beast taming techniques? Could you also introduce them to this old man?"</p><p></p><p>Ye Xiao thought for a moment.</p><p></p><p>"Hmm, just beat them to death, that's all."</p><p></p><p>Beitang Ce raised his eyebrows slightly.</p><p></p><p>"Is it really that simple? But why? When this old man tried beating the spirit beasts he found, it didn't have this effect at all? The mentality of Shenzong-grade spirit beasts has already been trained to an extremely powerful degree, they won't fear being beaten or death."</p><p></p><p>"Then find spirit beasts with slightly lower cultivation, when I took her in, she was only at the Xiantian one-grade Zongshi realm spirit beast level."</p><p></p><p>Hearing this, Beitang Ce's face couldn't help but twitch violently.</p><p></p><p>Ye Xiao took in Huan Liuli when she was only at the Xiantian one-grade cultivation level?</p><p></p><p>What kind of joke is this? By that logic, Ye Xiao should only be a little over 20 years old, and even if Huan Liuli cultivated diligently, she could at most have only cultivated for 20 years, and would be far from reaching this level, because Ye Xiao had just said that he beat Huan Liuli into submission.</p><p></p><p>That means Ye Xiao's cultivation had already broken through to the Xiantian one-grade Zongshi realm at that time.</p><p></p><p>So, calculated this way, Huan Liuli could have only cultivated for a little over 10 years.</p><p></p><p>From Xiantian one-grade to Xiantian seven-grade Shenzong in just over 10 years? Crossing six realms in one go? This has to be a joke, right? Not even riding a rocket could one ascend that quickly.</p><p></p><p>However, when he looked at Ye Xiao, he suddenly felt he could understand it a bit.</p><p></p><p>With such a monstrous master, cultivating such a monstrous spirit pet, is that not normal?</p><p></p><p>Afterwards, he shook his head and followed Ye Xiao into the courtyard.</p><p></p><p>"Forget it, this old man is still not quite suited for raising spirit beasts."</p><p></p><p>However, as soon as he entered the courtyard, he was attracted by a strange feeling.</p><p></p><p>"Huh? What's this?"</p><p></p><p>His gaze fell on something in the corner of the courtyard that looked like a potted plant.</p><p></p><p>"I didn't expect Mr. Ye to also have the leisure and elegance to grow potted plants, and even carve a spiritual gathering array on it."</p><p></p><p>Ye Xiao glanced at it.</p><p></p><p>"That's not a potted plant, but I've used a defensive array, so you can't see the wonders hidden inside it."</p><p></p><p>Ye Xiao snapped his fingers, dispelling the defensive array, and in the next moment, the entire small space revealed its true appearance.</p><p></p><p>"My goodness!"</p><p></p><p>Beitang Ce immediately widened his eyes, his jaw almost dropping to the ground in shock.</p><p></p><p>"This, this... Mr. Ye, you actually created a small mountain with spatial power in your own little courtyard to cultivate heavenly materials and earthly treasures?</p><p></p><p>My goodness! The abundance of heavenly materials and earthly treasures here, how much must there be? Your scale is simply too grand!"</p><p></p><p>It's no wonder Beitang Ce was so shocked. Who could have imagined that this seemingly small flower pot actually had such a different world hidden inside, filled with so many precious treasures?</p><p></p><p>These heavenly materials and earthly treasures, not only are they not easily obtainable for ordinary people, even if it was a large company, they wouldn't be able to collect as comprehensively and as well as Ye Xiao.</p><p></p><p>Incredible!</p><p></p><p>Moreover, the pot that cultivates these heavenly materials and earthly treasures has already been refined into a treasure imbued with spatial power. </p><p></p><p>On its surface, an array has also been inscribed.</p><p></p><p>Just this one pot alone can already be considered priceless.</p><p></p><p>It would require the joint efforts of several top-tier forgers and array masters, working together for half a month, to create something like this.</p><p></p><p>Yet Ye Xiao casually placed it on the ground like a broken flower pot.</p><p></p><p>This is simply too extravagant!</p><p></p><p>"Mr. Ye, today you have truly opened the eyes of this old man. This old man is completely amazed..."</p><p></p><p>Here is my translation of the Chinese excerpt:</p><p></p><p>"I didn't dare to imagine that someone could actually do this?" </p><p></p><p>"You're too kind."</p><p></p><p>Ye Xiao snapped his fingers again, concealing the array of earth-shattering formations, hiding the abundant heavenly materials and earthly treasures, lest others covet them.</p><p></p><p>"Let's go."</p><p></p><p>Ye Xiao led Northern Courtyard Ce into the room.</p><p></p><p>Northern Courtyard Ce followed Ye Xiao into the room, wiping the nervous sweat from his forehead. Luckily, he had brought three seventh-grade spirit beasts of the Divine Ancestor realm when he came. </p><p></p><p>Otherwise, he would have been utterly embarrassed tonight.</p><p></p><p>Just as he was thinking about this, Huan Liuli had already brought out the delicious food she had prepared for tonight's dinner.</p><p></p><p>The first dish served was a plate of stir-fried eggs with chili peppers. As a ninth-grade Innate cultivator, Northern Courtyard Ce could immediately sense the dense spiritual energy emanating from this dish of stir-fried eggs.</p><p></p><p>"The spiritual energy is so powerful! These eggs are not ordinary eggs, are they?"</p><p></p><p>Ye Xiao nodded.</p><p></p><p>"These are the eggs of a seventh-grade spirit beast. Oh no, I think one of them has already advanced to an eighth-grade spirit beast."</p><p></p><p>Northern Courtyard Ce: "(⊙.⊙)!"</p><p></p><p>He detected the extraordinary nature in Ye Xiao's words.</p><p></p><p>"Wait a minute, you couldn't be... also raising several Divine Ancestor-level spirit beasts just to have their eggs to eat, right?"</p><p></p><p>"That's right."</p><p></p><p>Northern Courtyard Ce: "(灬)!"</p><p></p><p>What kind of existence would be able to do such an unbelievable thing? Raising Divine Ancestor-level spirit beasts as livestock? If he hadn't seen it with his own eyes, he would never have believed it in his lifetime.</p><p></p><p>He also had no doubt that Ye Xiao was telling the truth. With Ye Xiao's powerful and monstrous existence, he wouldn't need to deceive him.</p><p></p><p>"Eat up! It will not taste good if it gets cold."</p><p></p><p>Huan Liuli had already set the bowls and chopsticks in place.</p><p></p><p>Northern Courtyard Ce nodded and began to pick up his chopsticks. The next moment, Huan Liuli brought out a plate of stir-fried garlic chives with squid.</p><p></p><p>Northern Courtyard Ce's eyes bulged again.</p><p></p><p>Because he could clearly sense that this plate of stir-fried garlic chives with squid contained a huge amount of blood energy and spiritual energy, even more powerful than the dish made with the eggs of the Divine Ancestor spirit beast.</p><p></p><p>Was this for real?</p><p></p><p>"Mr. Ye? Is this dish also made with the meat of a Divine Ancestor spirit beast?"</p><p></p><p>Ye Xiao nodded.</p><p></p><p>"Yes, the ninth-grade Divine Ancestor Noel Fis, who was previously detained at the Shaolin Temple. </p><p></p><p>Originally, there was only a clone of him in the Jianghai City, but during the previous incident with Li Liushui, his main body secretly escaped and was captured by me. I've been raising him."</p><p></p><p>The corner of Northern Courtyard's mouth twitched uncontrollably.</p><p></p><p>He felt that he could no longer describe Ye Xiao using common logic.</p><p></p><p>This guy was truly a monster among monsters.</p><p></p><p>Previously, he had thought that bringing three seventh-grade Divine Ancestor spirit beast corpses was already extravagant enough.</p><p></p><p>But now, he realized that he was lucky to have brought those three seventh-grade Divine Ancestor spirit beast corpses. Otherwise, he wouldn't have had the face to come today, or even if he had come, he would have wanted to find a hole to hide in at this moment.</p><p></p><p>How embarrassing! But soon, he no longer thought this way.</p><p></p><p>He felt that it was truly embarrassing that he had only brought three seventh-grade Divine Ancestor spirit beast corpses today.</p><p></p><p>Because the following dishes that Huan Liuli brought out were all made with the blood and flesh of Divine Ancestor spirit beasts.</p><p></p><p>All of them! And even more terrifying, some of them contained the blood and flesh of Demigod-level spirit beasts!</p><p></p><p>When he saw the Demigod-level spirit beast blood and flesh, Northern Courtyard completely collapsed.</p><p></p><p>He began to doubt his own existence.</p><p></p><p>If this had happened to anyone else, even the four great Venerable Ones of the Nine Realms, he wouldn't have been so embarrassed.</p><p></p><p>The three seventh-grade Divine Ancestor spirit beast blood and flesh he had brought today would have been considered a generous gift.</p><p></p><p>But who knew that this guy Ye Xiao would completely disregard the rules.</p><p></p><p>This sumptuous feast had directly turned the precious gifts he brought into something as common as street food.</p><p></p><p>"Mr. Ye, I have a question I want to ask you, and I hope you will tell me the truth."</p><p></p><p>Ye Xiao took a bite of the stir-fried eggs and nodded.</p><p></p><p>"Go ahead."</p><p></p><p>Northern Courtyard Ce spoke again:</p><p></p><p>"Do you eat like this every day? Or did you prepare this feast just because I was coming today?"</p><p></p><p>Before Ye Xiao could respond, Huan Liuli walked in with a smile.</p><p></p><p>"Of course we eat like this every day! What kind of feast is this? This is just our master's everyday home-cooked meal.</p><p></p><p>We eat like this for breakfast, lunch, and dinner. Today is actually a relatively simple meal."</p><p></p><p>Snap.</p><p></p><p>Northern Courtyard Ce's chopsticks fell to the ground.</p><p></p><p>He was completely overwhelmed.</p><p></p><p>His worldview had completely collapsed.</p><p></p><p>It was only at this moment that he truly understood how powerful Ye Xiao was.</p><p></p><p>Although the house he lived in was small and dilapidated, the food he ate every day was the most precious feast in the world, surpassing any delicacies.</p>

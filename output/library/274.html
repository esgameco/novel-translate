        <h1>Chapter 274</h1>
        <div class="content">
            <p>Here is the full English translation of the Chinese excerpt:</p><p></p><p>"Senior Li, what's going on with you?" </p><p></p><p>Li Liushui, who was surrounded by a bloody aura, slowly turned his head to look at Fa Zheng, although his entire body was enveloped in a crimson demonic qi.</p><p></p><p>But he still had some remaining consciousness.</p><p></p><p>"I don't know either. Just now, while I was cultivating, an evil energy rushed into my body, activating the demonic qi within me, causing it to go berserk.</p><p></p><p>Right now, I can still use my willpower to suppress it for a while. But I don't think it will last long.</p><p></p><p>You must go to the library and find the librarian, he is one of the Four Sages of the Nine Provinces, the Sage of the Black Tortoise.</p><p></p><p>Only he can save me. Only he can suppress me.</p><p></p><p>Also, notify the others to leave this place immediately. I might rampage at any moment, and they won't be able to withstand a single strike from me."</p><p></p><p>"Understood!" </p><p></p><p>Fa Zheng responded and immediately began to retreat.</p><p></p><p>Aro moved his lips, wanting to say something, but in the end, he just saluted Li Liushui and then turned and ran.</p><p></p><p>The demonic qi surrounding Li Liushui was simply too heavy, he had no way to resist it.</p><p></p><p>And he knew that Li Liushui's strength ranked ninth in the Dragon Ranking, a true master among masters.</p><p></p><p>Perhaps no one in the entire Tianzhu could be his match, and if he were to be killed by him, there wouldn't even be anyone to avenge him.</p><p></p><p>Furthermore, he was now eager to join the Nine Provinces, and there would be no masters from Tianzhu to stand up for him.</p><p></p><p>It's better to run first.</p><p></p><p>Soon, Jiang Chen arrived at the Shaolin Institute of the Martial Arts Academy, seeing the demonic qi surrounding Li Liushui, he couldn't help but let out a sigh.</p><p></p><p>"I thought you could hold out a little longer, but I didn't expect you to lose control so soon. If I had known it would be like this, I should have asked Ye Xiao to wait a bit before leaving, so he could try to help you.</p><p></p><p>The sword techniques he cultivates might have given you some inspiration.</p><p></p><p>What a pity!"</p><p></p><p>Li Liushui raised his eyebrows slightly.</p><p></p><p>"Ye Xiao? I feel like I've heard that name before. If I'm not mistaken, the Sage's library seems to have a very young manager named that."</p><p></p><p>Jiang Chen smiled.</p><p></p><p>"Yes, you're right, he is the Sword Immortal of the Jianghai City, I just found that out myself."</p><p></p><p>Li Liushui's heart trembled.</p><p></p><p>"So he is the Sword Immortal? He's so young, yet he's already the Sword Immortal? How old is he? Has he already reached the Quasi-Emperor Realm?"</p><p></p><p>"He's 21 years old, and he's in the Emperor Realm! Not the Quasi-Emperor Realm, but the true Emperor Realm!"</p><p></p><p>Boom! This sentence was like a heavy bomb exploding in Li Liushui's mind.</p><p></p><p>"21 years old! Emperor Realm! Emperor Realm! This youth is of extraordinary talent, yet he's only a small librarian in the library? </p><p></p><p>What extraordinary magnanimity! What lofty realm! No wonder he could break through to the realm I've been struggling to reach for hundreds of years.</p><p></p><p>How laughable that I've cultivated for hundreds of years, yet I'm still inferior to a little child. Laughable, laughable!"</p><p></p><p>Seeing Li Liushui's eyes flashing with a faint red glow, indicating his mind was starting to unravel, Jiang Chen immediately raised his hand and released a stream of spiritual energy, infusing it into Li Liushui's body.</p><p></p><p>"Liushui, snap out of it, don't let this demonic qi take over your consciousness. Protect your spiritual realm!</p><p></p><p>Ye Xiao has gone to the Long White Mountain, he should be back soon, and he will definitely be able to help you escape this danger.</p><p></p><p>Don't give up."</p><p></p><p>These words, infused with Jiang Chen's own spiritual energy, had a thunderous and righteous tone, and Li Liushui's mind stabilized a bit.</p><p></p><p>He let out a long sigh and looked at the Sage of the Black Tortoise, his gaze resolute. "Sage, can you promise me one thing?"</p><p></p><p>"Speak."</p><p></p><p>"If I can't hold on, kill me! Don't let me harm the world."</p><p></p><p>The Sage of the Black Tortoise's heart trembled, and he nodded, his heart filled with bitterness.</p><p></p><p>Li Liushui had contributed a lot to the Nine Provinces over the years.</p><p></p><p>In every battle against the beast calamities, Li Liushui had expended a great deal of his strength.</p><p></p><p>He could be considered one of the tiger generals of the human race in the Nine Provinces! But now, he had fallen into this predicament, which couldn't help but make one sigh with sorrow.</p><p></p><p>In the Long White Mountain, as Ye Xiao's divine blood continued to be awakened, wave after wave of golden radiant energy flashed continuously around him.</p><p></p><p>This scene made the dragon vein let out a low rumble.</p><p></p><p>"This child, how extraordinary he is? Decades ago, that junior called Qinglong didn't have this demonic talent. It seems he's not just trying to activate his divine blood, he's trying to refine and activate the divine blood throughout his entire body. Isn't he being a bit too greedy? For an ordinary human cultivator, they can only first activate a certain amount of bloodline, then break through to the Emperor Realm, and then cultivate the dragon qi for a second refinement and breakthrough. Only by reaching the peak of the Emperor Realm can they further break through to the Martial God Realm!</p><p></p><p>But he, he has just barely reached the Emperor Realm, his cultivation base is simply not enough to refine the complete divine blood!"</p><p></p><p>Here is the full English translation of the Chinese excerpt:</p><p></p><p>The divine blood within the Feiren Clan requires not only external power, but also the power within their own bodies. Only when the two are fully fused, with both internal and external cultivation, can this be truly achieved.</p><p></p><p>This is also why the Boundary King cannot directly break through to the Divine Realm - between the Boundary King and the Divine Realm, there is the Emperor Realm! In the Emperor Realm, one cultivates the spiritual energy within while cultivating the dragon energy outside, and only when the two are fused can one truly break through the shackles of the human flesh and reach that legendary realm.</p><p></p><p>As he spoke, the golden glow around Ye Xiao grew stronger, and a faint aura of multicolored auspiciousness gradually emerged.</p><p></p><p>The huge eyes of the Dragon Vein could not help but widen.</p><p></p><p>He's about to succeed?</p><p></p><p>What kind of joke is this?</p><p></p><p>With just the Boundary King realm, he's directly refining complete divine blood - this is something that has never happened before in history.</p><p></p><p>This kid, he's truly going to defy the heavens! However, at this moment, the multicolored auspicious glow around Ye Xiao gradually began to fade.</p><p></p><p>The Dragon Vein's expression suddenly changed.</p><p></p><p>"Not good, the dragon energy within him is still a bit lacking, the activation of the divine blood is about to fail!"</p><p></p><p>As his expression darkened, the Dragon Vein ultimately gritted his teeth, weighed the pros and cons, and decisively provided Ye Xiao with four-tenths of his own dragon energy!</p><p></p><p>This was an extremely risky and draining move for him. Dragon energy is like the Dragon Vein's lifeblood, and just like humans, if it is greatly depleted, the consequences can be imagined.</p><p></p><p>However, if he could cultivate an existence that could fully activate divine blood at just the Boundary King realm, the impact on the future of the entire Feiren Clan would be immense and undeniable.</p><p></p><p>And it would be a positive kind of progress.</p><p></p><p>Ye Xiao's cultivation might reach a level that has never been seen before in history, becoming the true number one figure in the Nine Realms.</p><p></p><p>Reaching that level, even the celestial beasts above the starry skies would no longer be able to invade the Feiren Clan.</p><p></p><p>Ye Xiao might become the one to end all wars.</p><p></p><p>So, although it was extremely risky and draining for himself, the Dragon Vein still chose to make this selfless contribution of his dragon energy.</p><p></p><p>With this additional dragon energy, the divine blood within Ye Xiao that was originally beginning to fade, suddenly erupted again.</p><p></p><p>The multicolored auspicious glow began to shine even more brilliantly than before.</p><p></p><p>Seeing this, the Dragon Vein nodded in satisfaction, and then fell into a deep slumber. He had consumed too much of his dragon energy at once, and would need to rest for at least a hundred years before he could fully recover.</p><p></p><p>Under the starry sky, on the coast of the Eastern Sea, a thin figure stood atop a cliff.</p><p></p><p>He appeared to be around forty years old, with a square face, wearing a long blue robe and carrying a long sword, looking like someone from the last century.</p><p></p><p>He stood at the edge of the cliff, which had been eroded by the waves and wind, forming a large opening that looked like a giant dragon's head, roaring towards the sea.</p><p></p><p>Every time the wind blew through the dragon's head, it would emit a series of sharp sword beams, merging together to form a dragon's roar.</p><p></p><p>The middle-aged man looked up at the moon in the sky, his eyes narrowing slightly, with a faint glow flickering.</p><p></p><p>"The heavens are changing! Since the Ancestral Dragon, this is the first time. Could it be that another powerful figure of the Feiren Clan has broken through to the Divine Realm?"</p><p></p><p>Six days later, in the city of Jianghai, Li Liushui's demonic energy had become increasingly red, and some black demonic energy had even appeared due to the overwhelming redness.</p><p></p><p>His face had started to look ferocious.</p><p></p><p>His eyes had developed a vertical pupil.</p><p></p><p>All of this indicated that he was about to be completely corrupted by the demonic energy.</p><p></p><p>"Venerable One, please act. I feel like I can't hold on much longer. If I'm not mistaken, the thing that's causing me to be corrupted should be the object in your possession.</p><p></p><p>I can sense that the demonic energy invading my body is tempting me to attack you."</p><p></p><p>The Xuanwu Venerable was startled.</p><p></p><p>"Could it be that the other night when I gave the Xuanwu Token to Ye Xiao, that fellow's spiritual power leaked out and Ye Xiao didn't clean it up properly?</p><p></p><p>Damn it, if that's the case, then it's my fault. Liushui, don't worry, I won't give up until the very end. I will use my Boundary King realm power to suppress you. Wait for Ye Xiao's arrival.</p><p></p><p>Until the very last moment, you must persist and never give up!"</p><p></p><p>As soon as the words left his mouth, Li Liushui suddenly let out a roar like a wild beast.</p><p></p><p>"Roar!"</p><p></p><p>This furious roar was followed by the release of a shocking blade beam.</p><p></p><p>The blood-red blade beam radiated out for tens of thousands of miles, as if it was going to split the entire Jianghai City, from the Martial Arts Academy all the way to the Martial Arts Library.</p><p></p><p>Boom! Accompanied by a violent explosion, a massive 100,000-mile-long blade beam had been carved right through Jianghai City, as if the entire earth had opened its mouth.</p>

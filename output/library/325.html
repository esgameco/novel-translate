        <h1>Chapter 325</h1>
        <div class="content">
            <p>Here is the full English translation of the Chinese excerpt:</p><p></p><p>"With so many powerful experts appearing at the same time, can Ye Xiao withstand them?" </p><p></p><p>The expressions on the crowd's faces began to show concern.</p><p></p><p>"Qinglong, you are an Empyrean realm expert. Do you want to go up and help Ye Xiao?"</p><p></p><p>Qinglong shook his head.</p><p></p><p>"I trust in that child's strength. If he truly needs our help, he wouldn't have let us retreat in the first place, let alone split his spiritual energy clone to deal with the experts from the other states."</p><p></p><p>The speed of the three-headed Super Divine Star Beasts was extremely fast, and their power was naturally beyond words.</p><p></p><p>In the blink of an eye, they had already arrived in front of Ye Xiao.</p><p></p><p>Among the three Super Divine Star Beasts, one was a massive giant ape, over a hundred meters tall, even more colossal than the King Kong in Ye Xiao's previous life.</p><p></p><p>But its strength was not just a hundred times greater than King Kong's. </p><p></p><p>Capable of wielding spiritual energy, it could dominate an entire world.</p><p></p><p>Combined with the powerful blood qi and spiritual energy of the Super Divine Beast, it possessed formidable defense and combat power.</p><p></p><p>Another Star Beast had transformed into a humanoid form, and from its triangular eyes and the faint scale patterns on its face, one could tell its identity.</p><p></p><p>The last Star Beast had not taken a human form, but was a moth-like Star Beast, over fifty meters tall, with a ferocious appearance, sharp fangs, and keen claws that inspired fear.</p><p></p><p>Xuanwu in the back, seeing these figures, couldn't help but say with a grave expression:</p><p></p><p>"The ones who have come this time don't seem easy to deal with.</p><p></p><p>The moth-like one on the left should be Dolcis, ranked 68th on the Star Rank. His cruelty is notorious throughout the starry sky.</p><p></p><p>The Dragon King ranked 71st on the Star Rank not only has formidable combat power, but his mastery of poisons is unparalleled.</p><p></p><p>And the massive ape on the right, its strength is terrifying, seemingly the Tyrant Ape ranked 62nd on the Star Rank! They were already fierce combatants on the star battlefield, and now, after absorbing the divine blood of the Western Ren Clan, their strength has risen to the Empyrean realm! Qinglong, are you sure you don't need to go help Ye Xiao?"</p><p></p><p>Qinglong remained expressionless.</p><p></p><p>"You'll see for yourselves."</p><p></p><p>At this moment, the three Super Divine Star Beasts arrived, casting an indifferent gaze at Ye Xiao.</p><p></p><p>"To think that an inheritor of the Xuanhuang Clan would be born in this place with such scarce spiritual energy! You've killed so many of my Star Beast kin."</p><p></p><p>"But alas, it all ends here!"</p><p></p><p>"Let me send you on your way."</p><p></p><p>The moth-like Star Beast struck first. </p><p></p><p>High-level Star Beasts did not waste words, attacking immediately upon meeting their target, not caring who the opponent was.</p><p></p><p>Its speed was incredibly fast, almost instantaneous, appearing above Ye Xiao's head in the blink of an eye.</p><p></p><p>The flapping of its massive wings generated a fierce gale, rapidly rotating in the air, the friction creating thunderous explosions, with visible electrical sparks.</p><p></p><p>This gale infused with lightning directly pounced towards Ye Xiao's head, like a raging tornado!</p><p></p><p>Everything happened in an instant, beyond the visual capacity of the onlookers.</p><p></p><p>Before the others could even register the attack, it had already reached Ye Xiao, unleashing its technique.</p><p></p><p>Boom! In a moment, the gale had engulfed Ye Xiao's entire body, casting the heavens and earth into darkness, as if the light had been extinguished.</p><p></p><p>"Senior!" </p><p></p><p>The crowd's pupils constricted, their gazes filled with deep worry.</p><p></p><p>But in the next instant, a blade's radiance flashed through the gale, shattering it.</p><p></p><p>"So strong!"</p><p></p><p>The remaining two Star Beasts' pupils shrank.</p><p></p><p>Dolcis, sensing this power, did not dare to be careless either. Flapping its wings, it unleashed countless phosphorescent specks from them.</p><p></p><p>As these specks spread, the spiritual energy wherever they passed was incinerated, emitting a blinding bright glow from the intense heat.</p><p></p><p>Ye Xiao did not dodge or retreat, facing the scorching phosphorescent specks head-on. He raised his hand and unleashed a sword strike.</p><p></p><p>Boom! The sword qi rose up, like a sword slicing through the fabric of space, in an instant piercing through the scorching flames, cutting Dolcis' body in half.</p><p></p><p>The towering fifty-meter-tall moth-like Star Beast fell to the ground in a sorry state.</p><p></p><p>One Super Divine Beast, vanquished!</p><p></p><p>"Good!" </p><p></p><p>The crowd erupted in excitement, and the numerous observing cultivators from the Nine States also heaved a sigh of relief.</p><p></p><p>Even against Empyrean experts, Ye Xiao could calmly and effortlessly slay them.</p><p></p><p>They could rest assured now.</p><p></p><p>Xuanwu and the others also finally understood the meaning behind Sword Sovereign Qinglong's earlier words.</p><p></p><p>"Strange, Qinglong, even though we are all Empyrean realm experts, and have just recently broken through, why can Ye Xiao easily kill those Super Divine Beasts?"</p><p></p><p>"Yes, Ye Xiao has only just broken through to the Empyrean realm not long ago either. Why is his attack power so strong?"</p><p></p><p>Qinglong explained, "This is not just a matter of cultivation base. Techniques are also crucial. Ye Xiao's sword techniques far surpass ordinary Empyrean arts, the subtleties of which are beyond our ability to casually comment on."</p><p></p><p>"Then if Ye Xiao were to pass on his sword techniques to you, could you replace him in guarding the national gates?"</p><p></p><p>Qinglong: "(_..)!"</p><p></p><p>Here is the full English translation of the Chinese excerpt:</p><p></p><p>"Can you not compare me to him?" </p><p></p><p>"Why can't you be compared to him? Aren't you also an Empyrean realm expert?"</p><p></p><p>"I'm not worthy."</p><p></p><p>These three faint words revealed the endless bitterness in the Azure Dragon's heart.</p><p></p><p>He looked at Ye Xiao in the distance with a complex gaze, his heart also deeply doubting himself.</p><p></p><p>They were all from the Human Tribe, so why was Ye Xiao so abnormal?</p><p></p><p>It was really puzzling.</p><p></p><p>When Duolexis fell, Ye Xiao directly collected his corpse and star core into his own spatial storage ring.</p><p></p><p>Although the Moth-type couldn't be eaten, its physical body still contained a massive vital energy, the terrifying power of the quasi-Supremacy-level star beast, far beyond the capabilities of ordinary life forms.</p><p></p><p>In the storage ring, the Sovereign Dragon-Lion had already awakened.</p><p></p><p>There was no way around it, even if he pretended to sleep, those half-step Supremacy star beasts who saw him not moving wanted to pee on him to wake him up.</p><p></p><p>At this time, the various star beasts were discussing animatedly.</p><p></p><p>"Senior Sovereign Dragon-Lion, you are a mighty Supremacy realm expert, how did you also get captured?"</p><p></p><p>This embarrassing question, even the thick-faced Sovereign Dragon-Lion found it difficult to answer.</p><p></p><p>He looked up at a 45-degree angle and said in a sorrowful tone:</p><p></p><p>"That despicable Human Tribe, I was just about to slay them, but then he saw that he couldn't defeat me, and actually used underhanded tricks against me. Otherwise, I wouldn't have fallen to this state. It's all because I was too careless."</p><p></p><p>The other star beasts' expressions changed drastically, and then they angrily helped the Sovereign Dragon-Lion curse, speaking righteously.</p><p></p><p>"Damn those Humans! They are so despicable. Hateful!"</p><p></p><p>"Can't defeat us, so they use underhanded tricks, the filthy Humans, they never dare to face their own weakness."</p><p></p><p>"Senior Dragon-Lion, don't be discouraged, we believe that you must have a way to regain your former glory. In the future, when the opportunity arises, you can slay that bastard."</p><p></p><p>As soon as the words fell, a huge figure suddenly plummeted down.</p><p></p><p>Boom! The star beasts were startled.</p><p></p><p>"What's going on? What's coming now?"</p><p></p><p>When they saw the newcomer, they couldn't help but exclaim:</p><p></p><p>"Isn't this Duolexis, ranked 68th on the Star Ranking? He has also fallen victim to the Human Tribe's malice?"</p><p></p><p>"That's not surprising, even we were captured, so Duolexis being killed is within reason."</p><p></p><p>"No, Duolexis' physical body and vital energy were not this strong, he had already advanced to the Supremacy realm. He was slain in his Supremacy form."</p><p></p><p>"Damn it, this despicable Human Tribe, they actually used shameless tricks to slay one of our Supremacy-level star beasts!"</p><p></p><p>The other star beasts were all angrily accusing Ye Xiao, only the Sovereign Dragon-Lion, looking at the slain Duolexis, fell into deep silence and inner turmoil.</p><p></p><p>Was this Human Tribe really so abnormal? Outside the storage ring, seeing Duolexis' body taken, the remaining Tyrant Ape and Earth King Dragon's expressions changed, and they rushed over simultaneously.</p><p></p><p>"Human Tribe, return the physical bodies of our Supremacy star beasts!"</p><p></p><p>The Tyrant Ape's iron fist condensed, the fist the size of a large villa, causing the spiritual energy in the air to hum and explode.</p><p></p><p>The Earth King Dragon transformed into its star beast form, its body length exceeding hundreds of meters, opening its bloody maw, as if it could swallow a giant truck without a problem.</p><p></p><p>The two attacked simultaneously, the pressure and spiritual energy they unleashed were like tangible forces, surging towards the Immortal Realm, even forcing the Xuanwu Venerable and the others to retreat repeatedly.</p><p></p><p>Only the Sword Sovereign Azure Dragon could resist, standing firmly in place without retreating a single step.</p><p></p><p>Countless Jiuzhou warriors, seeing this scene, had their hearts racing again.</p><p></p><p>The two star beasts attacking together, the pressure was far greater than before.</p><p></p><p>Senior Sword Immortal, please hold on!</p><p></p><p>Ye Xiao remained calm and unhurried, facing the two Supremacy entities rushing towards him, he stepped forward and unleashed a Shattering Star Fist, colliding with the Tyrant Ape's giant fist.</p><p></p><p>The two fists were extremely uncoordinated.</p><p></p><p>One was the size of a villa, the other was a normal human fist, in comparison, it was like an elephant facing an ant.</p><p></p><p>However, when the two fists collided, Ye Xiao's fist was infused with an invincible divine might, directly breaking through the Tyrant Ape's aura defense.</p><p></p><p>Then the Tyrant Ape's iron fist began to shatter bit by bit.</p><p></p><p>Boom, boom, boom. Blood mist spread, and the Tyrant Ape's body involuntarily recoiled.</p><p></p><p>The Earth King Dragon emerged from behind the Tyrant Ape and swallowed Ye Xiao into its belly.</p><p></p><p>The fast-moving crowd couldn't even react.</p><p></p><p>"Senior!"</p><p></p><p>But the next moment, the tail of the Earth King Dragon's body directly emitted a sharp sword beam, tearing a large hole in its own flesh.</p><p></p><p>Ye Xiao's body shot out from within, activating the Plucking Star Hand, the invisible spiritual energy forming a giant palm that grabbed the Earth King Dragon's tail and viciously swung it, the hundreds of meters long Earth King Dragon turning into a long whip, lashing heavily against the Tyrant Ape's body.</p>

        <h1>Chapter 44</h1>
        <div class="content">
            <p>Here is the full English translation of the Chinese excerpt:</p><p></p><p>This sword illuminated the towering mountains! This sword stirred the stars in the sky! This sword made all living beings despair! After the sword light appeared, it did not pause at all, but directly split open the thousand-meter-tall mountain with one swift strike!</p><p></p><p>From the top all the way down to the foot of the mountain, the entire mountain was violently shaken by being split open, causing the surrounding land and cities to tremble.</p><p></p><p>A thunderous explosion echoed for over a hundred kilometers!</p><p></p><p>Within the mountain, dust was flying, and several powerful figures were directly sent to the afterlife by Ye Xiao's unreasonable sword strike! Splash...</p><p></p><p>Soon, a half-crippled figure heavily crashed in front of Ye Xiao.</p><p></p><p>"Pu chi--!"</p><p></p><p>He violently coughed up a mouthful of fresh blood, his entire face looking dreadfully withered.</p><p></p><p>Even though the other party only had half a body left, Ye Xiao could still see that their strength was at the Innate Grandmaster level! No wonder they could still miraculously survive under his terrifying sword strike, only being cut in half instead of being annihilated along with the others.</p><p></p><p>"I never expected that Jianghai City would have such a powerful existence, we have underestimated you!"</p><p></p><p>But soon, he started to sneer again.</p><p></p><p>"However, while it's easy for you to kill us, what about all the star beasts and tiger-wolves infected in this entire mountain forest? Can you kill them all? Even if a few escape, it will be enough to wreak havoc on the surrounding cities, haha haha cough cough cough..."</p><p></p><p>Rustling sounds kept coming from the mountain forest, as the star beasts and tiger-wolves were fleeing.</p><p></p><p>They were scattered in all directions, aimlessly.</p><p></p><p>Ye Xiao's face remained cold, and he did not speak.</p><p></p><p>But at this moment, a faint golden sword beam formed beside him, then a second, a third, a fourth, until the entire mountain was reflected in Ye Xiao's golden sword beams.</p><p></p><p>Then, one sword beam flew out, two sword beams flew out, three sword beams flew out... until a hundred thousand sword beams all flew out.</p><p></p><p>"Ah--!"</p><p>"Woo~!"</p><p></p><p>Heart-wrenching screams immediately echoed through the mountain forest.</p><p>Those were the uncontrollable, final roars of living beings as they perished.</p><p></p><p>Moments later, the entire mountain forest fell into complete silence! Even the sound of a falling leaf hitting the ground could be clearly heard.</p><p></p><p>The crippled grandmaster was dumbfounded, looking at Ye Xiao with disbelief and shock!</p><p></p><p>Annihilated!</p><p></p><p>Together, countless tiger-wolves and star beasts, numbering in the tens of thousands, were just wiped out like that? In less than a minute? Even a great grandmaster could only destroy part of the mountain forest, leaving behind a lot of traces, and would be unable to completely eliminate all the living beings, because they were too scattered! But the person before him had truly accomplished this feat! How immense must his spiritual power be? And how powerful must his combat strength be?</p><p></p><p>Such cultivation, so rarely seen in the world, was something the crippled grandmaster had never encountered in his entire life!</p><p></p><p>No, something's not right! The other party's age looks too young, that youthful face is just like a popular young actor on TV, looking no more than twenty years old! Yet he possesses such tremendous power.</p><p></p><p>The crippled grandmaster absolutely did not believe that Ye Xiao was truly twenty years old, there could only be one explanation - the legendary ability to return to one's prime and maintain eternal youth after reaching the Divine Grandmaster realm.</p><p></p><p>The person before him, so young yet so powerful, heavens, he must be a Divine Grandmaster expert!</p><p></p><p>Here is the full English translation of the Chinese excerpt:</p><p></p><p>Shen Zong!</p><p></p><p>There is actually a Shen Zong (Sage King) stationed in Jianghai City! They have actually provoked a Shen Zong! Just as he was lost in thought, a large tree in the distance suddenly let out a crisp sound and crashed to the ground, startling him awake.</p><p></p><p>Crack, rumble - the large tree crashed to the ground, like the final straw that completely collapsed his extremely tense spiritual power.</p><p></p><p>"No-!"</p><p></p><p>He spat out a mouthful of fresh blood, his eyes wide open, his physical body, heart, and blood vessels ruptured, and he was actually scared to death by the living Ye Xiao! Ye Xiao's brow raised slightly, activating the Taixuan Tiangong, and immediately locked his soul.</p><p></p><p>A look of bewilderment welled up in the other party's eyes, which then turned to shock and despair.</p><p></p><p>"You, you can even lock the soul?"</p><p></p><p>Before he could react, Ye Xiao's spiritual power had already directly invaded his soul body and began to search his memories.</p><p></p><p>A moment later, Ye Xiao's brow furrowed, and his expression became somewhat grave.</p><p></p><p>"It's actually him!"</p><p></p><p>At this time, a light and sound was coming from the mountaintop in the distance.</p><p></p><p>"Over here, hurry over!"</p><p></p><p>Ye Xiao knew that was the reinforcement team from the Jiangcheng garrison.</p><p></p><p>He looked at Gu Hai and the others lying asleep on the ground, his gaze softening a bit, and with a light step, he disappeared silently from the spot.</p><p></p><p>Back in the city, Ye Xiao's phone lit up again.</p><p></p><p>It showed several missed calls, as well as a text message, both from Qin Yuyan and Ning Yuhen.</p><p></p><p>Ye Xiao first called Ning Yuhen.</p><p></p><p>"Did you just call me?"</p><p></p><p>A soft, weak voice soon came through the phone.</p><p></p><p>"Manager Ye, the library was just robbed, and half of it was destroyed, and many colleagues died."</p><p></p><p>Ye Xiao narrowed his eyes slightly.</p><p></p><p>"So fast, they've already made their move? Where's Manager Yang? Is he still at the library?"</p><p></p><p>"I just saw him, he seemed to have sustained some minor injuries, but he's nowhere to be seen now. Should I go look for him?"</p><p></p><p>"No need, you stay safe and don't run around."</p><p></p><p>"Okay, I understand."</p><p></p><p>Ye Xiao had just hung up the phone when Qin Yuyan's call came through, and he swiped to answer.</p><p></p><p>Before he could speak, Qin Yuyan on the other end began:</p><p></p><p>"Thank goodness, you finally answered my call. Xiao Wan and I were so worried, and there's still no news from Gu Hai's side, and now the library has had an incident again."</p><p></p><p>"Sorry, I was busy just now."</p><p></p><p>"It's okay, with such a big incident at the library, you must be very busy. As long as everyone is safe."</p><p></p><p>"Thank you for your concern."</p><p></p><p>"Don't be so polite, I feel a bit embarrassed now. You go ahead and be busy."</p><p></p><p>"Okay."</p><p></p><p>After hanging up the phone, Ye Xiao activated the Taixuan Tiangong again and scanned around, but couldn't find what he was looking for, sighing lightly and deciding to go home first.</p><p></p><p>Huanliuli was sleeping soundly, lying on the sofa, a trickle of drool at the corner of her mouth, her small body sprawled in the shape of a 'big' letter, the pink Kitty-printed cotton blanket she had kicked to the floor. Ye Xiao shook his head, bent down to pick it up, and was just about to cover her when he heard Huanliuli's sleepy murmuring.</p><p></p><p>"Hehe, Ye Xiao, don't resist anymore, be a good pet for our family! Stick your butt up, our family is going to spank it hard!"</p><p></p><p>Second update, new book seeking support.</p><p></p><p>(This chapter ends)</p>

        <h1>Chapter 76</h1>
        <div class="content">
            <p>Here is the full English translation of the Chinese excerpt:</p><p></p><p>Ye Xiao turned back and saw it was Pao Jian-sheng.</p><p></p><p>"You two know each other?"</p><p></p><p>Qin Yu-yan looked a bit puzzled as she glanced between Ye Xiao and Pao Jian-sheng, seemingly not understanding their acquaintance.</p><p></p><p>These two - one was just a shut-in who only knew how to study in the library, the other was just a simpleton who only knew how to practice swordsmanship in the martial arts hall. </p><p></p><p>Didn't they both rarely leave their respective domains?</p><p></p><p>How could they have any intersection? Pao Jian-sheng spoke up:</p><p></p><p>"Previously, I went to the library to borrow some books, and that's how I got to know Mr. Ye."</p><p></p><p>"I see."</p><p></p><p>"Are you two on a date? I won't disturb you then."</p><p></p><p>With just one sentence, Qin Yu-yan's face instantly turned bright red.</p><p></p><p>But before Qin Yu-yan could explain, Pao Jian-sheng had already turned and left, walking in the direction of the academy's martial arts practice hall. </p><p></p><p>Along the way, there were occasionally some naive girls who wanted Pao Jian-sheng's contact information, but he ignored them all, continuing straight towards the martial arts hall.</p><p></p><p>"This guy is quite interesting, different from the other guys. Most guys don't have his level of quality," Ye Xiao couldn't help but comment as he watched Pao's retreating back.</p><p></p><p>Qin Yu-yan glanced at Ye Xiao with a slightly guilty look, then explained: "I heard he's seven-eighths of the Nine States bloodline, and only one-eighth is of the Han State bloodline."</p><p></p><p>"I see."</p><p></p><p>"He's actually a very good person, not tainted by the low quality of most guys. My grandfather and the others wanted him to come as an exchange student precisely because of this. Otherwise, even if his talent and reputation were high, my grandfather wouldn't have accepted him."</p><p></p><p>"I suspect there's more to it than just that, isn't there?"</p><p></p><p>Qin Yu-yan gave a wry smile.</p><p></p><p>"Yes, he's a disciple of the Sword Saint of the Han State, Liu Cheng-xun. My grandfather wants to learn some of Liu Cheng-xun's sword intent and techniques from him.</p><p></p><p>This is actually a bit underhanded for a martial artist.</p><p></p><p>But my grandfather has no choice.</p><p></p><p>In the past two hundred years, the Nine States have suffered large-scale beast attacks, causing many local traditions to be severed. </p><p></p><p>Plus the technical blockades between the states, the genetic technology and military technology of the Nine States haven't been able to develop.</p><p></p><p>So any opportunity to grow stronger and revive the martial arts of the Nine States, my grandfather won't let it slip by."</p><p></p><p>Ye Xiao fell silent.</p><p></p><p>It couldn't be denied that it was because of the quiet perseverance and efforts of people like them that the Nine States had been able to stand tall in the East all this time.</p><p></p><p>They could be considered the backbone of the Nine States.</p><p></p><p>While an individual may be insignificant, when many are dedicating themselves quietly for the Nine States, they will eventually uphold a towering giant.</p><p></p><p>In his previous life, Ye Xiao had greatly admired those unsung heroes and great scientists who wholeheartedly devoted themselves for their country. Now that he was in the Nine States and had some abilities, he should also contribute his meager efforts for the country.</p><p></p><p>This was not some saintly act, but the responsibility of a true son of the Nine States.</p><p></p><p>The decline of the martial arts traditions in the Nine States was indeed not good. But there would eventually be opportunities to make up for it, as the foundation was still there.</p><p></p><p>And martial arts strength could not be changed overnight.</p><p></p><p>However, the development of the Nine States' military technology was painstakingly slow. If he could contribute some military technology information, it would be a great help...</p><p></p><p>Here is the full English translation of the Chinese excerpt:</p><p></p><p>Perhaps it could bring a significant boost to the overall strength of the Nine Provinces, and the effect would be extremely fast!</p><p></p><p>Speaking of which, the few American fighter jets I encountered in the starry sky before seemed quite impressive. The pilots must have been grandmasters, so their value should not be small, right? At the time, I had already used the Taixuan Tiangong to scan the entire fighter jet, so I'm quite familiar with its structure and materials.</p><p></p><p>Why not draw the design blueprint of that thing?</p><p></p><p>After all, that thing is American, and the Americans themselves like to steal other people's things. If I steal it once, it can be considered as a contribution to society.</p><p></p><p>Moreover, what's the difference between copying the design blueprint and copying homework? They're both about writing and drawing on paper with a pencil. It's not a big deal, and it won't get anyone pregnant.</p><p></p><p>I believe the American scientists will understand and be grateful that I'm helping them promote their inventions.</p><p></p><p>"Ye Xiao, what are you thinking about?" Qin Yuyan called out, and Ye Xiao snapped out of his silence, then glanced at her.</p><p></p><p>"Nothing. If there's nothing else, I'll go back. I only took half a day off."</p><p></p><p>"Aren't you going to tell Gu Hai and Liangliang?"</p><p></p><p>"No need. Those two are in their romantic mood, and I'm just the third wheel. Goodbye."</p><p></p><p>Ye Xiao bid farewell to Qin Yuyan and left. Qin Yuyan couldn't help but shake her head slightly.</p><p></p><p>"This guy is probably going back to the library to read books again. He's hopeless."</p><p></p><p>In the City Lord's Mansion, Du Changfeng was discussing the upcoming city planning and construction with Du Tianyu, Qin Shenglong, and Ouyang Yunzhong.</p><p></p><p>"The foundation of a city lies in the library. The library must be further upgraded to absorb more martial arts techniques, maintain a fresh flow of blood, and allow the martial artists to find the most suitable techniques for themselves.</p><p></p><p>I currently have some students doing well in Chuzhou, and I can use my connections to bring in more techniques, especially high-level and elite ones!"</p><p></p><p>"The Martial Arts Academy also needs to be expanded. I plan to establish several key training classes for postgraduate entrance exams, aiming to cultivate a batch of high-quality martial artists. At the same time, I also want to establish a research class to arrange those students with deep academic attainments but not high cultivation, and cultivate a group of scientific and technological talents."</p><p></p><p>As soon as Qin Shenglong finished speaking, Du Changfeng raised his hand in agreement.</p><p></p><p>"It's completely feasible. Currently, scientific and technological talents are extremely scarce and highly valued in the Nine Provinces. If we can cultivate a few, the benefits in the short term will be immeasurable.</p><p></p><p>Unfortunately, we don't have the support of American scientists. Their new technologies are really too advanced. We can only watch enviously!"</p><p></p><p>As soon as the words left his mouth, a secretary quickly brought a document envelope to Du Changfeng.</p><p></p><p>"Professor Du, please take a look at this."</p><p></p><p>"What's the matter?"</p><p></p><p>"I don't know who gave it to me. By the time I noticed, it was already in my hand."</p><p></p><p>Du Changfeng's expression changed slightly. He knew his own secretary's cultivation was already at the Postmortem Seventh-Grade. For someone to be able to place the envelope in her hand without her noticing, their strength must not be underestimated.</p><p></p><p>He immediately opened the envelope, but when he saw what was inside, he instantly forgot his professorial demeanor and blurted out a curse, "Fuck!"</p>

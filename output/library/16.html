        <h1>Chapter 16</h1>
        <div class="content">
            <p>Here is the full English translation of the Chinese excerpt:</p><p></p><p>Without much hesitation, she immediately rushed downstream.</p><p></p><p>On the riverbank downstream, Ye Xiao exhaled a mouthful of turbid air, and the corners of his mouth curled up into a slight smile.</p><p></p><p>The fusion was complete.</p><p></p><p>He had obtained a cultivation method called the Purple Veil Star Sea.</p><p></p><p>Just like the Tyrant Blade, I don't know what grade it is, but judging from its power, it is definitely not an ordinary technique.</p><p></p><p>Ye Xiao tried it out a little, and its speed of absorbing spiritual energy was simply like a giant whale drinking water, so powerful that it made one's scalp tingle!</p><p></p><p>It seems that his continuous slashing of the Tyrant Blade had exhausted the spiritual energy in his body, but this was like having an "infinite mana regeneration" in a game.</p><p></p><p>However, what made Ye Xiao happy was not just this, but also the fact that his cultivation had advanced to the Xiantian Second Realm.</p><p></p><p>After breaking through the Xiantian Realm, each subsequent breakthrough would be exponentially more difficult than the previous one, equivalent to the sum of all the previous breakthroughs.</p><p></p><p>Some people might be stuck at the Xiantian First Realm for their entire lives.</p><p></p><p>No wonder they say that every three realms have an additional step.</p><p></p><p>The realms of Zongshi, Dazongshi, and Shenzong are not just different names, but represent vastly different levels of power.</p><p></p><p>Zongshi is the starting point of spiritual energy projection, their strength has reached the pinnacle, surpassing the limits of humanity, and they can freely control the spiritual energy within their bodies, achieving perfect containment.</p><p></p><p>It is said that Dazongshi can walk on air as if it were solid ground, and their body can spontaneously generate protective aura that ordinary people cannot break through.</p><p></p><p>As for Shenzong, they can even regenerate their bones and significantly increase their lifespan, completely breaking free from the constraints of their genetic makeup.</p><p></p><p>Now that Ye Xiao has reached the Xiantian Second Realm, as long as he can reach the Xiantian Fourth Realm in the future, he will become a Dazongshi, and if he reaches the Xiantian Seventh Realm, he will be a powerful Shenzong expert! He clenched his fist and silently encouraged himself.</p><p></p><p>"Keep it up."</p><p></p><p>At this moment, his keen perception suddenly sensed a figure entering his awareness.</p><p></p><p>This made Ye Xiao's brows furrow slightly.</p><p></p><p>"This time I'm hiding in the reed thicket, but someone still came to find me? It seems I can't come to this riverbank again, it's not safe."</p><p></p><p>Slightly furrowing his brows, he was about to turn and leave, but then a familiar voice reached his ears.</p><p></p><p>"Junior Qin Yuyan seeks an audience with the senior!"</p><p></p><p>"It's her?"</p><p></p><p>Ye Xiao was slightly surprised, and then he activated his spiritual energy, enveloping himself in a faint golden light, obscuring his figure and face, leaving only a vague silhouette visible.</p><p></p><p>The next moment, Qin Yuyan had already arrived in front of him, seeing Ye Xiao's figure shrouded in the golden light, her heart was racing.</p><p></p><p>She covered her chest, her delicate body trembling slightly with excitement.</p><p></p><p>It's him!</p><p></p><p>It's really him!</p><p></p><p>He is the senior she has been longing to see! At this moment, she was so excited that she was at a loss for words.</p><p></p><p>Taking a deep breath, she bowed deeply to Ye Xiao and said, "Senior, your junior Qin Yuyan is in awe of your sword techniques and wishes to be accepted as your disciple. May the senior please take me in?"</p><p></p><p>The Ye Xiao within the golden light was somewhat surprised.</p><p></p><p>So this woman decided to abandon the sword and learn the blade because of his one strike? Circulating his spiritual energy, he adjusted his voice to make it sound low and like an elder's.</p><p></p><p>"I do not take disciples."</p><p></p><p>Qin Yuyan's gaze revealed a hint of disappointment, but barely perceptible.</p><p></p><p>However, she remained firm in her resolve. After a moment, she gritted her teeth and said, "Even if the senior is unwilling to accept me as a disciple, Yuyan will definitely use the senior as her role model and carve out her own path in the way of the blade!"</p><p></p><p>Quite stubborn.</p><p></p><p>"Good luck to you."</p><p></p><p>With that, he lifted his foot and disappeared from the spot in an instant.</p><p></p><p>Qin Yuyan couldn't help but...</p><p></p><p>Here is the full English translation of the Chinese excerpt:</p><p></p><p>She was a bit disappointed. She really did love the way of the blade, that feeling as if she had found her true calling.</p><p></p><p>It was a pity that she couldn't take this senior as her teacher.</p><p></p><p>His strength was so formidable that if she could study under him, her mastery of the blade would surely reach new heights.</p><p></p><p>She returned to observe Ye Xiao's blade marks once more, and in her deep focus, she faintly glimpsed a golden blade radiance. "What is this...?"</p><p></p><p>Qin Yuyan was taken aback. She had actually sensed the intent behind Ye Xiao's stroke! In this moment, it was as if the entire world contained only this single blade, and she, standing before it, was but a tiny ant.</p><p></p><p>Finally, the blade intent sank slowly into her mind.</p><p></p><p>Qin Yuyan was overjoyed. She had grasped the blade intent contained within Ye Xiao's stroke, within her own mind.</p><p></p><p>If she could truly comprehend this blade intent, her future would be limitless!</p><p></p><p>"Thank you, senior!" </p><p></p><p>Qin Yuyan bowed towards the direction Ye Xiao had left, though she did not know if he could still see it, for this was the sincerity of her heart.</p><p></p><p>On Ye Xiao's end, he had already returned to the library.</p><p></p><p>After advancing to the Second Realm of the Innate, his speed had become even faster than before!</p><p></p><p>He didn't expect that this woman, Qin Yuyan, would have such deep determination, to be able to grasp the blade intent from his stroke marks! "After this, I should go rent a place. From now on, I'll fuse and upgrade my cultivation techniques there, can't keep going to the riverside.</p><p></p><p>There are too many lunatics in this world. If I keep going to that kind of place every day, I'm afraid I'll never have a moment's peace."</p><p></p><p>Ye Xiao felt he should go check out some houses. There seemed to be a real estate agency right next to the library.</p><p></p><p>After finishing his lunch, Ye Xiao went to the agency.</p><p></p><p>A well-dressed young man immediately came forward to greet him.</p><p></p><p>"Hello, are you looking to buy or sell a house?"</p><p></p><p>"I'm here to take a look at some houses."</p><p></p><p>"Okay, what's your budget?"</p><p></p><p>"Ten thousand."</p><p></p><p>"Ten thousand? At that price range, you probably won't be able to find anything in the city center, but we can take a look at some options in the suburbs."</p><p></p><p>Ye Xiao fell silent for a moment.</p><p></p><p>"I'll take another look."</p><p></p><p>He turned and left the agency.</p><p></p><p>His dream of buying a house had been dashed.</p><p></p><p>It seemed that in his past life as well as now, a house was too much of a luxury for him.</p><p></p><p>It would be best to just continue staying in the library dormitory.</p><p></p><p>At most, he could go cultivate in some remote mountain wilderness after fusing and upgrading his techniques.</p><p></p><p>A mere ten thousand, and even a hero is stumped!</p><p></p><p>As a grand master, it's not even worth mentioning.</p><p></p><p>But just as he was leaving, the young agent hurried after him.</p><p></p><p>"Sir, wait a moment."</p><p></p><p>Ye Xiao stopped.</p><p></p><p>"Sir, if you find the prices too high, you could also consider renting a place."</p><p></p><p>Ye Xiao was taken aback. That was also a good option.</p><p></p><p>After all, what he needed was a secluded, quiet place far from the city, to focus on fusing his cultivation techniques.</p><p></p><p>A discreet living space would be sufficient.</p><p></p><p>"Then I'd like a hidden, peaceful place, far from the city center."</p><p></p><p>After a pause, he added, "And preferably affordable."</p><p></p><p>This is the second update, thank you to the readers Cheng Liu Guang and Magic Front for their donations, I'm deeply grateful.</p><p></p><p>Originally, this chapter was meant to have the protagonist bestow a blade intent upon Qin Yuyan. But I felt that would be too abrupt and unrealistic, so I changed it to Qin Yuyan comprehending the blade intent on her own.</p><p></p><p>If anyone spots any mentions of the protagonist giving her the blade intent, please let me know and I will make the correction.</p><p></p><p>(End of chapter)</p>

        <h1>Chapter 232</h1>
        <div class="content">
            <p>Here is the full English translation of the Chinese excerpt:</p><p></p><p>Azuo Shana used his own sword aura to forcefully resist the eye technique of Beitang Ce. The two different forces clashed against each other, neither willing to back down.</p><p></p><p>But Azuo Shana was clearly much stronger than Beitang Ce. The sword aura was steadily rising up, pushing against Beitang Ce's eye power, which was simply unbelievable! The onlookers like Shi Guanghao who were in the midst of battle couldn't help but be shocked by this sight.</p><p></p><p>Such powerful strength. </p><p></p><p>Azuo Shana's move was simply astounding in its power. </p><p></p><p>The two forces were colliding head-on, yet he was actually able to push the opponent's power back! Beitang Ce's expression grew grave as he continuously poured more of his power into the eye technique, trying to unleash it to the fullest.</p><p></p><p>The excessive use of the eye technique's power even caused blood to continuously flow out from the corners of his eyes.</p><p></p><p>But Azuo Shana remained calm and composed. One hundred sword auras were advancing upwards in an orderly manner, clearly without even using his full strength.</p><p></p><p>On the riverbank, the Tree Demon Adulos crawled out, bedraggled. Since Azuo Shana's appearance had prevented Beitang Ce's eye power from targeting him, the ghostly flames on him had finally disappeared. His wounds were now being constantly healed by his own healing art.</p><p></p><p>He glanced up at Beitang Ce in the sky, a mocking expression in his eyes.</p><p></p><p>"Damned human race, the good show has only just begun!"</p><p></p><p>He then quickly rushed towards the Poisonous Dragon Scorpion Venerable, casting a healing art on him.</p><p></p><p>Meanwhile, the Immortal Soldier Temple originally located over 200 kilometers south of Zhongzhou City had now been completely razed to the ground, replaced by a massive earthen cocoon! </p><p></p><p>It was already as large as a small mountain, composed of the fallen leaves, soil, and stone fragments around it.</p><p></p><p>From afar, it looked like a giant earthen egg lying on the ground.</p><p></p><p>A yellow warbler flew over and landed on the earthen egg, curiously surveying the surroundings, as if feeling that this place was different from the rest.</p><p></p><p>But just then, the earthen egg beneath its feet suddenly let out a crisp cracking sound.</p><p></p><p>Crack!</p><p></p><p>This abrupt crisp sound immediately made the warbler let out a shrill cry, flapping its wings frantically to quickly flee.</p><p></p><p>It had just taken flight when the massive earthen egg erupted with even more cracking sounds, forming countless cracks like a spider web.</p><p></p><p>Until finally - Boom!</p><p></p><p>Accompanied by a violent explosion, the earthen egg completely shattered.</p><p></p><p>Ye Xiao's body was emanating a golden glow. </p><p></p><p>It was not his physical body that was glowing, but his soul! </p><p></p><p>At this moment, his soul power had cultivated to the peak of the Divine Venerable realm, surpassing even that limit.</p><p></p><p>He had comprehended the Kingly Dao Realm.</p><p></p><p>In other words, as long as his spiritual qi cultivation reached the King Realm level, with his soul and physical body fused, he would easily break through to the King Realm without having to worry about losing control like Li Liushui.</p><p></p><p>In fact, one could say that he was already at the half-step King Realm, just a tiny bit away from truly reaching the King Realm! Because for ordinary people, the most difficult hurdle in breaking through to the King Realm was the enhancement of one's soul power. </p><p></p><p>This was the most important and final barrier blocking everyone.</p><p></p><p>But Ye Xiao had already overcome this barrier.</p><p></p><p>It was almost like a guaranteed success.</p><p></p><p>At the same time, Ye Xiao was also very concerned about the fact that the Golden Book had started emanating scorching hot light, just like when he could fuse cultivation techniques before.</p><p></p><p>Ye Xiao could almost be certain that after reaching the King Realm, he would be able to synthesize Emperor Techniques.</p><p></p><p>"Right now, I only lack the spiritual qi cultivation, and in the short term, I won't be able to achieve it in one go. If I want to speed things up, I'll have to consider finding some Divine Venerable realm spirit beasts and refine medicinal pills, using their powerful blood qi to supplement the last bit of cultivation I need."</p><p></p><p>Ye Xiao closed his eyes, trying to test the range of his soul perception.</p><p></p><p>Now that his soul power had broken through to the King Realm, his perception abilities must have also improved significantly.</p><p></p><p>As soon as he closed his eyes, his soul perception rapidly expanded outwards from his body.</p><p></p><p>Soon, it had spread out to ten li, twenty li, thirty li, forty li, and quickly surpassed a hundred li, continuing to expand without stopping.</p><p></p><p>This was a very good sign. Just relying on his own soul perception, he could expand it to such a degree. If he used his spiritual power instead, how powerful would it be? Probably able to instantly scan the entire Zhongzhou City, which was over 200 kilometers away, more than 400 li!</p><p></p><p>This was a earth-shattering change in the enhancement of his abilities.</p><p></p><p>"Hm?"</p><p></p><p>Just as Ye Xiao was using his soul perception to expand towards Zhongzhou City, he suddenly sensed the situation in Zhongzhou City, causing his expression to change.</p><p></p><p>"This is...? The sealed spirit beasts have escaped?"</p><p></p><p>Without any further hesitation, Ye Xiao immediately rushed back towards Zhongzhou City.</p><p></p><p>In the skies above Zhongzhou City, the Sword Saint Azuo Shana had grown weary after a few rounds of battle with Beitang Ce.</p><p></p><p>Although Beitang Ce was an eye technique cultivator...</p><p></p><p>Here is the full English translation of the Chinese excerpt:</p><p></p><p>Compared to the average Innate Ninth-Grade cultivator, they were slightly more powerful, but the gap between the two of them was truly too great! Even though they were both Innate Ninth-Grade experts, the difference in their strength was as vast as the heavens and the earth.</p><p></p><p>The gap in cultivation was not something that could be easily caught up to. <div class="contentadv"><script>loadAdv(7,3);</script></div>So, after a few exchanges, Azuo suddenly felt quite dejected:</p><p></p><p>"Not fun, forget it, I shouldn't have had any expectations of you."</p><p></p><p>With that, he stepped forward and instantly disappeared from the spot.</p><p></p><p>"Damn it!"</p><p></p><p>Beitang Ce's eye technique could vaguely see his afterimage and some of his movements. </p><p></p><p>But his eye technique attacks could no longer keep up with Azuo's speed.</p><p></p><p>The next moment, Azuo appeared right in front of him, and before he could unleash his eye technique again, two dazzling golden beams suddenly erupted from Azuo's eyes.</p><p></p><p>These two golden sword beams charged towards Beitang Ce's Demonic Fire Spirit Eyes, and Beitang Ce naturally exerted all his strength, fully unleashing his eye technique to compete with Azuo, absolutely not allowing the sword beams to enter his pupils.</p><p></p><p>That was his greatest reliance, and if it were to be destroyed, he would be defeated like a mountain collapsing, and everything would be over.</p><p></p><p>But just as he was struggling to hold on, Azuo raised his hand and swept a sword across Beitang Ce's chest.</p><p></p><p>Boom! A single sword strike! It was enough to directly blast Beitang Ce away, without the slightest resistance.</p><p></p><p>Beitang Ce spat out a mouthful of fresh blood in the air, like a cannon shell, and was blown back, crashing heavily onto the barrier formed by the protective formation around the city.</p><p></p><p>"Senior Beitang!" </p><p></p><p>Stone Guanghao and the others were anxious, immediately wanting to go to his aid, but at this moment, a familiar voice suddenly reached their ears.</p><p></p><p>"Don't be in a hurry to worry about others, you'd better worry about yourselves first!"</p><p></p><p>As soon as the words fell, a sense of crisis swept over them.</p><p></p><p>It was the Venerable Poisonous Scorpion! He had been healed by the Tree Demon's healing art and had now fully recovered from his injuries, immediately joining the battle.</p><p></p><p>The Venerable Poisonous Scorpion's poison art erupted, and a thick purple mist rapidly rose up from the ground.</p><p></p><p>As soon as this mist appeared, the air itself was corroded, emitting a violent sizzling sound.</p><p></p><p>Stone Guanghao and the others' faces changed drastically, and they quickly retreated.</p><p></p><p>No one dared to touch this poisonous mist, as once contaminated, they might perish on the spot.</p><p></p><p>Its destructiveness was several times stronger than the attacks of the Divine Ancestor!</p><p></p><p>Above Beitang Ce's head, Azuo had already begun to condense a towering sword beam. That sword beam had a majestic aura, and every golden light it emitted seemed to be filled with a dense sword intent, slicing through the clouds.</p><p></p><p>Unexpectedly, this sword beam would be able to completely slay Beitang Ce.</p><p></p><p>And it might even split him in half.</p><p></p><p>Moreover, it had the potential to break through the defensive barrier of the Central State City!</p><p></p><p>Inside the Central State City, the common people had only just evacuated less than half, and there were still at least two-thirds left.</p><p></p><p>Outside the protective formation of the Central State City, countless spirit beasts were standing by, ready to participate in the feast of devouring the human race.</p><p></p><p>If Azuo's sword beam were to break through the protective formation, the consequences would be unimaginable! It would not only be the end of Beitang Ce, but also the end of all the common people in the Central State City!</p><p></p><p>But now, there was no one who could stop him.</p><p></p><p>Stone Guanghao and the others were not strong enough, and they had already been suppressed, with numerous injuries on their bodies. They could barely take care of themselves, let alone save others.</p><p></p><p>Beitang Ce had been severely injured by that sword strike, with his chest exposed, revealing his stark white bones, and the beating of his heart could even be vaguely seen.</p><p></p><p>He was no longer able to fight.</p><p></p><p>The Demonic Fire Spirit Eyes had seen through Azuo's sword strike, which had condensed his own tremendous power, and was still continuously condensing, already reaching a strike beyond his limits! The eyes had even begun to simulate his death, being split in half by a single sword! At the moment of facing death, Beitang Ce was no longer as afraid.</p><p></p><p>It was as if he had a sense of liberation.</p><p></p><p>At this moment, his heart was unusually calm.</p><p></p><p>Perhaps this was the feeling of being completely powerless after making efforts, and thus resigning himself to his fate? He couldn't help but wonder in his mind, if Ye Xiao were here, could he defeat Azuo? With Ye Xiao's heaven-bestowed talents, could he save the Central State City?</p><p></p><p>Azuo's sword beam finally descended, the sword moved, and the wind and clouds dispersed, with even ghosts and gods avoiding it!</p><p></p><p>The overwhelming power of that strike, even made all the cultivators in the Central State City unable to catch their breath, and the weaker ones below the Patriarch Realm couldn't even stand up.</p><p></p><p>Despair filled and spread, shrouding every person's heart.</p><p></p><p>The spirit beasts outside the protective formation roared in fury and excitement, as if singing the funeral dirge of the human race!

        <h1>Chapter 306</h1>
        <div class="content">
            <p>Here is my translation of the Chinese excerpt:</p><p></p><p>The arrival of Jiang Chen once again stirred up the tension among the group. </p><p></p><p>Everyone knew that he had gone to find Ye Xiao. His presence meant that Ye Xiao would be coming as well.</p><p></p><p>However, when Jiang Chen approached them, the group was slightly surprised to see that Ye Xiao was not with him.</p><p></p><p>"Venerable Xuanwu, where is Ye Xiao?" </p><p></p><p>Jiang Chen chuckled. "Ye Xiao is not coming."</p><p></p><p>"What?" </p><p></p><p>Hearing this, the group was shocked.</p><p></p><p>"Venerable, are you joking?" </p><p></p><p>"Yes, how can he not come? He's the main character here. Everyone has been waiting for him."</p><p></p><p>"Has he gone mad? This is such a good opportunity that others would beg for, yet he's not coming. Has he lost his mind?"</p><p></p><p>Both Baihu and Li and Lu couldn't help but criticize.</p><p></p><p>Only Zhu Que knitted his brows.</p><p></p><p>"Could it be that the boy doesn't want to use Blue Dragon's true martial dao as a stepping stone for his own advancement?"</p><p></p><p>Hearing this, the group paused. </p><p></p><p>Yes, this was the only possible explanation.</p><p></p><p>They all knew Ye Xiao was a good-natured person with proper values.</p><p></p><p>If it was out of arrogance or disdain for fighting Blue Dragon, that would be impossible. </p><p></p><p>The only explanation was that he didn't want to rise by stepping on Blue Dragon's shoulders.</p><p></p><p>This would be extremely cruel for Blue Dragon. </p><p></p><p>Moreover, Ye Xiao would be forever indebted to Blue Dragon.</p><p></p><p>"Ah, this boy has a good heart, it's just... what a pity to miss such a good opportunity, there may never be another like it."</p><p></p><p>Lu Qingshan sighed.</p><p></p><p>But Jiang Chen shook his head with a smile.</p><p></p><p>"You've all guessed wrong. Ye Xiao is not coming, not because of that reason, but for a different one."</p><p></p><p>"What does the Venerable mean?"</p><p></p><p>"You'll know soon enough."</p><p></p><p>With that, he took a small red flower from his pocket.</p><p></p><p>"Ye Xiao has infused his heartfelt intent into this small red flower, and asked me to give it to Blue Dragon. Let me present it to Blue Dragon first."</p><p></p><p>He quickly flew towards the mountain peak, while Zhu Que couldn't help but furrow his brows: "That red flower has an extremely powerful aura. Could it be that this boy has hidden his martial dao attainment within that small red flower, so that he can help Blue Dragon break through?"</p><p></p><p>The group paused.</p><p></p><p>"This boy is truly a good one. It's just a pity to miss such a good opportunity."</p><p></p><p>They never expected that originally it was Blue Dragon helping Ye Xiao, but now it had turned into Ye Xiao sacrificing himself to help Blue Dragon.</p><p></p><p>In the midst of their speculations, Xuanwu brought the small red flower to Blue Dragon and handed it to him.</p><p></p><p>"Blue Dragon, this is what Ye Xiao asked me to give you."</p><p></p><p>Blue Dragon raised his eyebrows slightly.</p><p></p><p>"Didn't I say to use my martial dao true intent to help that boy break through? How did it turn into him helping me break through instead? Did you say something?"</p><p></p><p>Jiang Chen waved his hands repeatedly.</p><p></p><p>"Blue Dragon, how can you say that? You know me, do you think I would do such a thing? Don't worry, the boy hasn't sacrificed himself. You, just take this flower calmly."</p><p></p><p>After saying that, without waiting for Blue Dragon to say anything else, Jiang Chen reached out and placed the small red flower in Blue Dragon's hand, then jumped back, avoiding the vicinity.</p><p></p><p>Only he knew that this small red flower was extraordinary, so he didn't dare to get close.</p><p></p><p>Holding the small red flower, Blue Dragon suddenly felt a unusual sensation.</p><p></p><p>He had already sensed the power within the flower! It was extremely strong, a power he had never seen before.</p><p></p><p>However, through the small red flower, he could not fully feel the true extent of the power within.</p><p></p><p>"What is this...?"</p><p></p><p>After the initial bewilderment, Blue Dragon's expression became grave.</p><p></p><p>The next moment, he infused a bit of spiritual energy into the flower, then tossed it out.</p><p></p><p>The small red flower drifted in the air with the wind, but after Blue Dragon inputted that spiritual energy, its petals began to release a faint golden glow, flickering on and off, as if a powerful force was about to burst out from within.</p><p></p><p>At this moment, everyone also vaguely sensed something extraordinary, and all their gazes were fixed on it, staring intently.</p><p></p><p>Their heartbeats quickened as their eyes followed the swaying of the flower.</p><p></p><p>Thump, thump, thump...</p><p></p><p>Finally, a few seconds after Blue Dragon tossed it out, the small red flower suddenly released its full power. An unimaginably powerful force erupted from its core.</p><p></p><p>In the next moment, this force rose unstoppably from the ground, piercing through the thick clouds and creating a huge hole in the sky. It stirred and churned the clouds, causing them to sink and form a massive inverted cone.</p><p></p><p>This was a sword intent, a sword intent that shook the heavens upon its release.</p><p></p><p>This sword intent was filled with the highest principles and realm of the Dao of the Sword.</p><p></p><p>Blue Dragon stood in place, his expression shifting from shock, to bewilderment, and then to awe. His eyes widened, his pupils shrinking to the extreme.</p><p></p><p>Here is the full English translation of the Chinese excerpt:</p><p></p><p>This sword strike allowed him to feel a sword dao power he had never experienced before. This sword strike allowed him to break through his previous understanding and reach a level he had never attained before.</p><p></p><p>This sword strike also made him realize why Ye Xiao was unwilling to come, and had only given him a small red flower.</p><p></p><p>Ye Xiao was not unwilling to come, he simply no longer needed to come.</p><p></p><p>His own martial dao truth had no more use for Ye Xiao.</p><p></p><p>On the contrary, the martial dao truth Ye Xiao had given him had allowed him to break through to that final level.</p><p></p><p>Qinglong could feel that the sliver of martial dao truth he had always lacked the most had finally been completed under Ye Xiao's sword strike! His body had already begun to change, and his power was continuously rising.</p><p></p><p>He was going to break through the realm he had never been able to break through for a long time.</p><p></p><p>In this moment, Qinglong submitted!</p><p></p><p>Completely and utterly submitted.</p><p></p><p>He had a clear understanding of his own natural talent, which surpassed the talents of all geniuses in this world.</p><p></p><p>He was an unparalleled genius that towered above all talents.</p><p></p><p>This was no empty words.</p><p></p><p>He had entered the Xiantian realm at the age of ten, become a Saint Sovereign at twenty, and been crowned a King at thirty! It was almost a major realm breakthrough every ten years.</p><p></p><p>This was a rarity under the heavens, and even when compared to the greats in the history of the Nine Provinces, he would not fall short, and could be ranked among the top ten!</p><p></p><p>And those people had long since passed away, so he was rightfully the number one in the present world.</p><p></p><p>And he was far, far above everyone else as the number one.</p><p></p><p>Now, facing Ye Xiao, he knew he had lost, not because he intentionally lost to Ye Xiao, wanting to make him a stepping stone and lend him a hand to push him onto the throne.</p><p></p><p>But he had truly lost!</p><p></p><p>"This youth, is truly the number one in the Nine Provinces! The number one under the heavens! Even in history, he is one of the rare number ones!"</p><p></p><p>Two tears slid down Qinglong's cheeks.</p><p></p><p>There was the joy of losing to Ye Xiao, and the emotion of the birth of a true genius.</p><p></p><p>In his life, he had seen countless talents, but had never been moved by any of them.</p><p></p><p>Because all the talents he had encountered were not as talented as himself.</p><p></p><p>Only when he met Ye Xiao did he lose wholeheartedly.</p><p></p><p>In the distance, the onlookers Fire Blade Zhuque, Bai Hu, Sword Saint Lu Qingshan, and Dao God Li Liushui were all petrified on the spot.</p><p></p><p>No one had expected that Ye Xiao had already reached such a terrifying level!</p><p></p><p>Had he already become an Emperor Realm expert?</p><p></p><p>In such a short time?</p><p></p><p>How old was he? He had already become an Emperor Realm expert? This guy, did he have no limits to his reversal of heaven?</p><p></p><p>Among them, Lu Qingshan, looking at that sword beam, entered a mysterious state of mind that could not be explained.</p><p></p><p>This sword strike had finally allowed the cultivation he had long been unable to break through to start breaking through at this moment.</p><p></p><p>Rumbling, a thunderous sound came, and the sky quickly began to gather a storm of tribulation.</p><p></p><p>Li Liushui and the others were startled, quickly jumping away.</p><p></p><p>"Brother Qingshan is about to break through, quickly make way!"</p><p></p><p>The others quickly made way, their minds shaken and shocked.</p><p></p><p>For ordinary people to reach the King Realm, they would encounter the Tribulation.</p><p></p><p>Only Ye Xiao, the freak, would encounter a small Tribulation even at the Saint Sovereign Realm.</p><p></p><p>Others would encounter the Tribulation at the King Realm.</p><p></p><p>The last time Dao God Li Liushui's breakthrough did not encounter the Tribulation, it was because Ye Xiao's activation of the Divine Blood had blessed the Nine Provinces, and he had thus been protected from the Tribulation.</p><p></p><p>Now Lu Qingshan did not have such good luck, and directly encountered the Tribulation.</p><p></p><p>Rumbling, at this moment, a thunderous sound was coming from the horizon, and a purple qi was gathering from the east.</p><p></p><p>The others were shocked again.</p><p></p><p>"It's the Purple Qi from the East, the Purple Celestial Tribulation! Brother Qinglong is also going to undergo the Tribulation."</p><p></p><p>"My goodness, this is too crazy, one sword beam has forged an Emperor Realm expert, and a King Realm expert. Is Ye Xiao trying to turn the heavens upside down?"</p><p></p><p>Jiang Chen was chuckling secretly beside them.</p><p></p><p>When he learned that Ye Xiao had broken through to the Emperor Realm, he had already anticipated this scene, and now seeing the others shocked, he couldn't help but find it amusing.</p><p></p><p>Taking a deep breath, Qinglong opened his eyes again, his gaze now extremely resolute.</p><p></p><p>Facing the Purple Celestial Tribulation, he stepped forward without hesitation.</p><p></p><p>A sword cultivator should advance without retreat.</p><p></p><p>Once the sword is drawn, there is no path to retreat.</p><p></p><p>Drawing the sword is to reveal the blade, no matter what obstacles lie ahead, mountains or seas, I will cut them down with one sword! He and Lu Qingshan were like two sword beams, soaring into the clouds, experiencing the martial dao realm of battling the heavens and breaking through their limits in the Tribulation.</p><p></p><p>Everywhere in the heavens and earth were thunderous lightning, divided into two parts, one small and one large.</p><p></p><p>But regardless of which part, the power they possessed was enough to instill great fear, the strong ones shaking the heart.</p><p></p><p>The entire Tribulation lasted nearly half an hour, the might of it attracting countless onlookers from afar, who dared not approach.</p><p></p><p>Second update, 6,000 words.</p><p></p><p>Please recommend and vote. </p><p></p><p>Thank you to the readers Super Brother Ah, Reader w Dumi, and Reader Red Dream for your donations, greatly appreciated.</p><p></p><p>(This chapter is complete)</p>

        <h1>Chapter 121</h1>
        <div class="content">
            <p>Here is the full English translation of the excerpt from the Chinese novel:</p><p></p><p>In Ye Xiao's small courtyard, the master and servant were staring at each other.</p><p></p><p>Ye Xiao sat in the chair, his expression indifferent as he looked at Huan Liuli. Huan Liuli was trembling in fear, shivering like a primary school student who had been caught doing something wrong by their parent.</p><p></p><p>She knew that Ye Xiao's silence was more terrifying than if he spoke. She could feel that at this moment, the master was searching her memories.</p><p></p><p>"Master, master..."</p><p></p><p>After a long while, Huan Liuli could no longer bear the pressure and stammered out a question.</p><p></p><p>Ye Xiao's eyelids fluttered, and then he spoke:</p><p></p><p>"Five hundred years, quite an ambition. Then, to prevent you from making me your pet 500 years from now, I'll just peel off your skin, remove your tendons, and refine you into a medicinal pill right now.</p><p></p><p>After all, you are a primordial second-grade Sect Master-level spirit beast, and your nutritional content is not insignificant. I can't let it go to waste."</p><p></p><p>Huan Liuli: "Σ(っ°Д°;)っ!"</p><p></p><p>Plop! Without any extra words, Huan Liuli immediately knelt on the ground, crawled a few steps, and hugged Ye Xiao's leg, wailing loudly.</p><p></p><p>"Master, you're joking, right? Don't kill me! Cat meat isn't good, it's too sour. Even if you refine me into a pill, it'll be sour and hurt my teeth! Waaah..."</p><p></p><p>"But what am I supposed to do? The lifespan of a spirit beast is too long. What if you surpass me in a few hundred years?"</p><p></p><p>Huan Liuli cried even more miserably.</p><p></p><p>"Master, please don't joke with me like that. With your rate of advancement, even if I turn into a rocket, I still won't be able to catch up! As long as you're around, I'll be your spirit pet, your servant, your dog!"</p><p></p><p>Ye Xiao nodded.</p><p></p><p>"That's true, but I'm still quite unhappy. You need to do something to make me happy."</p><p></p><p>Huan Liuli hurriedly nodded.</p><p></p><p>"Not just one thing, but a hundred things, a thousand things, I'll do anything!"</p><p></p><p>"Alright, you said it yourself, I didn't force you. Those two demihuman cultivators coming to Jianghai City at this time, it's probably not just to find you, right? Their cultivation is at the primordial second-grade level. Even in some demihuman organizations, that's not a simple existence."</p><p></p><p>Huan Liuli sniffed and replied in a silly manner:</p><p></p><p>"And then?"</p><p></p><p>"As a spirit beast, go outside of Jianghai City and investigate a few spirit beast organizations to see what they're trying to do."</p><p></p><p>Ye Xiao vaguely felt that his previous unease might be related to those two demihumans.</p><p></p><p>He had cultivated the Taixuan Tiangong, and could already perform soul searching, but when Huan Liuli had cried for help earlier in the crisis, he had used the Taixuan Tiangong to directly blast the opponent's head and soul into ashes, leaving nothing behind.</p><p></p><p>The Butianshu and Chenxing Jue, two supreme healing techniques, would require at least a trace of soul to repair.</p><p></p><p>But when Huan Liuli heard Ye Xiao's words, she suddenly bristled.</p><p></p><p>"What? Master! You want me to be a traitor? No way, no way, no way! I may be your spirit pet, but I still have some principles. I can't betray my own kind and dig up information on the entire spirit beast clan, that would get too many of them killed!"</p><p></p><p>Huan Liuli did have some principles.</p><p></p><p>Killing a few spirit beasts was fine, but being a traitor and investigating the entire spirit beast clan was beyond what she could bear.</p><p></p><p>"Really won't go?"</p><p></p><p>Ye Xiao asked again, and Huan Liuli replied firmly:</p><p></p><p>"Absolutely not! Even if you kill me, skin me, remove my tendons, and refine me into a pill, I still won't go!"</p><p></p><p>"Alright then. I was going to reward you with a medicinal pill to help you break through to the primordial third-grade if you helped me gather intelligence. Looks like I'll have to find another way."</p><p></p><p>Here is the full English translation of the Chinese excerpt:</p><p></p><p>"Eat it yourself."</p><p></p><p>Huan Liuli: "...!"</p><p></p><p>Regardless of her shock, Ye Xiao actually refined the two almost completely transformed beast corpses into a medicinal pill right in front of her.</p><p></p><p>The speed of refining a pill using the "Myriad Elements Converge into One" method was extremely fast. In the blink of an eye, a gleaming golden medicinal pill was refined, spinning and swirling in the air, emanating an alluring fragrance.</p><p></p><p>"Gulp!"</p><p></p><p>Huan Liuli swallowed hard. Just as Ye Xiao was about to store the medicinal pill in his storage ring, her small delicate hand directly grabbed the pill.</p><p></p><p>"Master, I have a deep secret that I've hidden in my heart for many years. </p><p></p><p>In fact, no matter how many beast corpses there are, they can't compare to my loyalty to you!</p><p></p><p>It's just being a spy and gathering some intelligence, right? </p><p></p><p>Serving you is the eternal glory for me."</p><p></p><p>After saying this, she quickly got up, leaped off the ground, and ran out of the courtyard towards the outskirts of Jianghai City.</p><p></p><p>As soon as she left the courtyard, she couldn't wait to stuff the medicinal pill into her mouth, afraid that Ye Xiao might change his mind.</p><p></p><p>As the medicinal pill entered her mouth, a refreshing fragrance surged into her nose, reaching her head!</p><p></p><p>"Wow, this medicinal pill is so fragrant!"</p><p></p><p>After eating this medicinal pill, Huan Liuli felt the spiritual energy in her body start to boil. Although she didn't break through to the Xiantian Third-Grade, her cultivation was definitely greatly enhanced!</p><p></p><p>In that moment, she suddenly felt that being with Ye Xiao was quite useful.</p><p></p><p>At least during the time she had been with Ye Xiao, her cultivation had indeed improved significantly.</p><p></p><p>It seems that she should stay close to Ye Xiao, as that's the only way for her cultivation to improve faster.</p><p></p><p>For the sake of her own advancement, her fellow beast brethren, you'll have to sacrifice a bit.</p><p></p><p>Your sacrifice won't be in vain. Your blood and bones will cultivate me into the supreme Beast Emperor!</p><p></p><p>Give me five hundred years, no, five hundred years is too little, add another hundred years, six hundred years!</p><p></p><p>After six hundred years, I will definitely trample Ye Xiao underfoot and keep him as my pet, spanking his little butt every day to avenge you all.</p><p></p><p>After seeing Huan Liuli leave, Ye Xiao felt much more at ease.</p><p></p><p>As long as he found the source and resolved it, there wouldn't be any problems.</p><p></p><p>In fact, even without using his spiritual power to search, he could guess Huan Liuli's thoughts.</p><p></p><p>Huan Liuli was a beast, her wild nature difficult to tame.</p><p></p><p>It took Xuanzang a lot of time to subdue Sun Wukong, and Ye Xiao had only been with Huan Liuli for a short while. But Ye Xiao wouldn't kill Huan Liuli.</p><p></p><p>This wasn't because Huan Liuli had Dragon-level bloodline.</p><p></p><p>Although Dragon-level bloodline was rare, he could still manage to steal an egg from a beast nest.</p><p></p><p>What he truly cared about was Huan Liuli's intelligence.</p><p></p><p>No matter how powerful this cat became, her low intelligence was irreversible, and low intelligence meant easier control.</p><p></p><p>Dragon-level bloodline was easy to find, but to find a Dragon-level beast with low intelligence that was easy to control, that was not so easy.</p><p></p><p>At this moment, Gu Hai's call came through.</p><p></p><p>"Hey, old Ye, have you eaten yet?"</p><p></p><p>"Not yet."</p><p></p><p>"That's perfect, come to Qingya Residence, we'll have a good meal tonight. I need to thank you properly."</p><p></p><p>"I won't go, you don't have money, last time it was me who paid the bill."</p><p></p><p>"I have money this time. My wife gave it to me."</p><p></p><p>"Alright, I'm on my way then."</p><p></p><p>"Hurry up, or we won't be able to book a private room."</p><p></p><p>It's 3 a.m., time to save the draft.</p><p></p><p>Thank you to book friends Guangxian Qilin and Yangxingqishi for the donations, greatly appreciated!</p><p></p><p>(This chapter is complete)</p>

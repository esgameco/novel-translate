        <h1>Chapter 68</h1>
        <div class="content">
            <p>Here is my translation of the Chinese excerpt:</p><p></p><p>"Little Ning Ning is so smart, she immediately guessed it was her sister." </p><p></p><p>The other person's words were full of a teasing tone, but Ning Yuthen felt as if he had fallen into an icy pit, his whole body breaking out in cold sweat.</p><p></p><p>In spiritual energy combat, the Azure Wolf's strength was extraordinary, and it was doubtful whether any of the three grand masters in the Jianghai City could defeat him in single combat! And the Charm Fox was a master of mental control, with terrifying spiritual techniques.</p><p></p><p>Even grand master warriors would have difficulty matching them.</p><p></p><p>If these two joined forces, even the three grand masters of Jianghai City working together might not be able to defeat them.</p><p></p><p>He was truly at a dead end, with no way out.</p><p></p><p>Ning Yuthen gritted his teeth, thinking that rather than being tortured to death by the two of them, he might as well end it himself.</p><p></p><p>Thinking this, he immediately raised his hand, preparing to commit suicide.</p><p></p><p>But just as he raised his hand, the Azure Wolf casually waved his hand, a beam of light directly blasting off Ning Yuthen's arm.</p><p></p><p>"Ahhh!"</p><p></p><p>This excruciating pain caused Ning Yuthen to immediately faint.</p><p></p><p>"Tsk tsk, Azure Wolf, you're too rough. Little Ning is still a junior after all, with such thin arms and legs, you really don't know how to be gentle at all."</p><p></p><p>The Azure Wolf's face was icy cold.</p><p></p><p>"Shut up and hurry up and scan his memories, find that bastard who killed Basan and Meg."</p><p></p><p>"Alright, alright~."</p><p></p><p>The Charm Fox Master feigned helplessness, spreading her hands, then immediately unleashed her clan's signature technique, her spiritual energy surging into Ning Yuthen's body like a tidal wave.</p><p></p><p>"???"</p><p></p><p>Just as her spiritual energy entered Ning Yuthen's mind, she suddenly paused, her expression changing.</p><p></p><p>Because within Ning Yuthen's spiritual sea, there now stood a young figure.</p><p></p><p>This figure was formed from condensed spiritual energy, standing there with his hands behind his back, his eyes coldly regarding her, as if he had been waiting for her arrival all along.</p><p></p><p>"Are you the mastermind behind the killings of Basan and Meg?"</p><p></p><p>Ye Xiao did not respond to her. He had held back just now because he had been waiting for Ning Yuthen to be knocked unconscious, as it wouldn't have been good to act while he was still awake.</p><p></p><p>Now that the Charm Fox's spiritual energy had surged in, that meant he could send these two Demon God Sect masters on their way.</p><p></p><p>With a slight shift of his gaze, an even more powerful spiritual energy began to overwhelm the Charm Fox.</p><p></p><p>"So strong!"</p><p></p><p>The Charm Fox's pupils constricted, her very soul beginning to tremble.</p><p></p><p>Not daring to be careless, she immediately tried to withdraw her spiritual energy. But Ye Xiao's speed was too fast, giving her no chance to react as he ruthlessly crushed her invading spiritual energy, then followed the same path to strike at her soul.</p><p></p><p>"Pu-chi!"</p><p></p><p>The Charm Fox, who had been standing there, suddenly spat out blood and was blasted back, flailing like a kite with its string cut in midair.</p><p></p><p>"Charm Fox!"</p><p></p><p>The Azure Wolf stomped his foot, his body instantly darting forward to catch the Charm Fox's body, only to find that she was already on the verge of death.</p><p></p><p>"What happened?"</p><p></p><p>"Run..." the Charm Fox struggled to say, and the Azure Wolf, not daring to be careless, immediately turned and fled.</p><p></p><p>But just as he turned, a blade-like light, shining like a brilliant meteor in the darkness, instantly closed in on his forehead.</p><p></p><p>He had no time to react, and the moment he saw that blade-light, his consciousness sank into darkness.</p><p></p><p>His physical body and soul were mercilessly shattered by that single strike, leaving no trace behind.</p><p></p><p>Thud. The Azure Wolf and Charm Fox's bodies fell to the ground once more.</p><p></p><p>"Azure Wolf!"</p><p></p><p>Here is my translation of the Chinese excerpt:</p><p></p><p>Fox Demon couldn't help but cry out in alarm, and the next second, her head was stepped on by someone.</p><p></p><p>Fox Demon glanced out of the corner of her eye and couldn't help but tremble again.</p><p></p><p>It's him!</p><p></p><p>The same person she had just witnessed in Ning Yuhen's spiritual sea! He turned out to be a powerful martial arts expert as well! Just as she was thinking about it, she suddenly felt her spiritual power being invaded.</p><p></p><p>Oh no!</p><p></p><p>He wants to search her spiritual power and obtain the information of the Beast God Sect! Just like how she wanted to invade Ning Yuhen's spiritual sea to find Ye Xiao.</p><p></p><p>She must not let him succeed! Fox Demon gritted her silver teeth, already prepared to detonate her own spiritual power.</p><p></p><p>Although doing so would plunge her into an irreversible abyss, she had no other choice!</p><p></p><p>If a powerful expert like him obtained the information of the Beast God Sect, it would be a disaster for the sect! But just as she was about to detonate her spiritual power, she suddenly found that she was unable to mobilize her spiritual power at all!</p><p></p><p>Ye Xiao's spiritual power was too strong, directly suppressing her spiritual power!</p><p></p><p>In this moment, Fox Demon was completely in despair.</p><p></p><p>Why did the Beast God Sect come to Jianghai City?</p><p></p><p>This place is not a place for people to stay, this is hell! "Found it!"</p><p></p><p>As these four words entered Fox Demon's ears, she felt Ye Xiao's foot suddenly exerting force on her head, pressing down like a ton of boulders. Boom! The next moment, Fox Demon's consciousness sank into darkness like a blue wolf.</p><p></p><p>"I'll reward you."</p><p></p><p>Ye Xiao spoke indifferently, and Xuanliu immediately transformed into her true form and pounced, devouring the two half-beast Sect Master experts.</p><p></p><p>These two had very strong star beast bloodlines, and their strength was formidable. After devouring them, Xuanliu's strength would be greatly enhanced.</p><p></p><p>While Xuanliu was greedily devouring the Sect Masters here, Ye Xiao raised his right hand high.</p><p></p><p>The reason he was looking for information on the Beast God Sect was to catch them all in one net.</p><p></p><p>Cutting the weeds without removing the roots, the spring breeze will blow again.</p><p></p><p>This Beast God Sect has challenged his bottom line multiple times, and if he doesn't destroy the entire sect, they will eventually come back even stronger.</p><p></p><p>The first to strike wins, the later one suffers. For the sake of peace, he must annihilate them.</p><p></p><p>As he raised his hand, a golden sword beam only an inch long suddenly formed rapidly three feet above his head.</p><p></p><p>Although it was only an inch long, the spiritual energy condensed within it was vast.</p><p></p><p>The power it contained was not just the full force of a Grand Sect Master, but several times that.</p><p></p><p>In fact, other Grand Sect Masters could not do this. If they could, wouldn't everyone be able to fight above their level by compressing their spiritual energy?</p><p></p><p>The main reason was that Ye Xiao's cultivation method, the Heavenly Sword Slash, was of such a high level that it could condense the power of multiple attacks into a single strike, thereby achieving an attack power that surpassed his own level! After feeling that it had gathered about ten times the attack power, Ye Xiao then unleashed the Mysterious Heaven Divine Might, infusing it with spiritual power.</p><p></p><p>He had just searched the location of the Beast God Sect and the appearance of the Beast God from Fox Demon's spiritual power.</p><p></p><p>So as long as he input the coordinates and the appearance of the Beast God into it through spiritual power, it would become like an automatic cruise missile, seeking out the Beast God's lair.</p><p></p><p>Once everything was infused, Ye Xiao lightly flicked a finger at the sword beam.</p><p></p><p>"Go, bring peace to the world from the Beast God!"</p>

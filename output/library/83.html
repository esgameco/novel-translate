        <h1>Chapter 83</h1>
        <div class="content">
            <p>Here is the full English translation of the Chinese excerpt:</p><p></p><p>It was probably about ten minutes later when Fa Zheng came out, holding an alms bowl in his hand, inside which was a star beast's core, still dripping with a bit of fresh blood.</p><p></p><p>The star beast's body and soul must have been exorcised.</p><p></p><p>Everything was very calm, as if nothing had happened.</p><p></p><p>But this was normal.</p><p></p><p>Fa Zheng was a great master of the innate fifth rank. Exorcising a small star beast, whose strength was roughly equivalent to the post-celestial ninth rank, was a trivial matter for him. After that, the two continued to wander around the Jianghai City.</p><p></p><p>Over the course of the afternoon, they exorcised three more star beasts that were mingling among the crowd, as well as a vengeful ghost.</p><p></p><p>By the evening, Fa Zheng's face had become slightly pale, and his gaze had a hint of emptiness.</p><p></p><p>Ye Xiao felt that he was not tired, after all, those were just minor characters, and as a great master of the innate fifth rank, he should not have been exhausted by a few minor characters.</p><p></p><p>But he did not ask the reason.</p><p></p><p>"Shall we continue?"</p><p></p><p>Fa Zheng shook his head.</p><p></p><p>"No, Ye Shishi must be hungry as well, let's have a meal first."</p><p></p><p>"Alright."</p><p></p><p>Ye Xiao did not stand on ceremony either. This time, he found a very nice waterfront restaurant and ordered a full fish feast.</p><p></p><p>Fa Zheng, as usual, had a bowl of rice and a cup of plain boiled water.</p><p></p><p>After a day of interaction, Ye Xiao had already grasped Fa Zheng's temperament and character. He was like a benevolent elder who had experienced the vicissitudes of life, with a mild-tempered disposition.</p><p></p><p>So there was no need for him to be polite.</p><p></p><p>Otherwise, why did he agree to come here in the first place? Shouldn't he give him a little reward?</p><p></p><p>Ten thousand a day, it's not like he can't afford it. If he doesn't eat well, wouldn't that be a waste?</p><p></p><p>The food arrived quickly, a variety of delicious fish and vegetable dishes, visually appealing and nourishing.</p><p></p><p>Ye Xiao and Illusion Jade ate heartily.</p><p></p><p>But Fa Zheng did not pick up his chopsticks, just watching Ye Xiao eat.</p><p></p><p>Suddenly, he spoke:</p><p></p><p>"Ye Shishi, do you think it's possible for humans and star beasts to coexist peacefully?"</p><p></p><p>Ye Xiao shook his head.</p><p></p><p>"What makes you say that?"</p><p></p><p>Fa Zheng asked again, but Ye Xiao said:</p><p></p><p>"Master, you misunderstood my meaning. I meant that I don't know. Because I'm just a small librarian."</p><p></p><p>Ye Xiao's words made Fa Zheng chuckle wryly.</p><p></p><p>Yes, why did he ask Ye Xiao? After all, Ye Xiao was just a post-celestial second rank warrior who hadn't even awakened his spiritual soul, just a small manager of a library.</p><p></p><p>It wasn't that Fa Zheng looked down on him, but Ye Xiao's identity, status, and strength limited his perspective.</p><p></p><p>Fa Zheng didn't speak again, silently picking up his bowl to eat the rice.</p><p></p><p>In fact, Ye Xiao had a vague understanding.</p><p></p><p>Fa Zheng was troubled in his heart.</p><p></p><p>This old monk was originally a kind-hearted person. Having him come to exterminate the star beasts, his inner heart was inevitably shaken.</p><p></p><p>After all, there were also some good existences among the star beasts, and as for the protected humans, who could say that there were no bad people among them?</p><p></p><p>So in the afternoon, his face had become a little pale. It wasn't that he was injured or physically exhausted, but that he had fallen into self-doubt, and his state of mind had been disturbed.</p><p></p><p>For a warrior, especially a high-level one, this was a major taboo.</p><p></p><p>As a mature person, you can think about the problem, but you can't get too deeply involved in it.</p><p></p><p>The fundamental issue between star beasts and humans is the opposition in terms of living resources, and the opposition in terms of spiritual and cultural aspects.</p><p></p><p>The two are completely different life forms.</p><p></p><p>Discussing whether killing star beasts is right or wrong is completely meaningless.</p><p></p><p>A human being may even kill other humans for some reason, let alone star beasts.</p><p></p><p>The current problem is that if star beasts appear in human cities and go berserk, they will bring devastating disasters to humans! </p><p></p><p>This is uncontrollable, and the same goes for half-beasts. When they're good, they're good, but when they're bad, they're really deadly.</p><p></p><p>There have been too many bloody lessons in history.</p><p></p><p>Here is the full English translation of the Chinese excerpt:</p><p></p><p>So there is a saying that goes, "Those of a different tribe, their hearts must be different." </p><p></p><p>In reality, there is no need to get too caught up in this. When you think about it, the reason we have to kill the star beasts is not because we can't control them. If we could control them, it wouldn't matter whether we killed them or not.</p><p></p><p>It's just like in Ye Xiao's previous life, when people invented machine guns, so the fierce nomads of the grasslands all became skilled singers and dancers.</p><p></p><p>Before humans can completely subdue the star beasts, slaying them is the only choice.</p><p></p><p>Being too merciful, if any link in the chain goes wrong, it could wipe out the human race - then there would be no one left to even cry about it.</p><p></p><p>At the end of the day, we're still not strong enough.</p><p></p><p>Only the strong can master everything! Only the strong have the right to choose! They can choose whether to slay the star beasts or raise them as pets.</p><p></p><p>However, this also gave Ye Xiao a wake-up call.</p><p></p><p>As one's cultivation improves, the things one sees with the eyes and comprehends in the mind will also gradually elevate.</p><p></p><p>Much of the new knowledge one encounters will often shatter previous understandings.</p><p></p><p>At this point, one will fall into self-doubt, and may then make some erroneous judgments and choices, leading to a descent into demonic cultivation!</p><p></p><p>So one must absolutely not be confused! Thinking about this, Ye Xiao suddenly had an enlightenment.</p><p></p><p>When he entered the Great Sect, his previous two enlightenments were: one about protection, protecting his family and friends; and one about the heart - the heart of the strong, unbound by constraints. But the essence of these two enlightenments was actually the same.</p><p></p><p>That is, to become stronger.</p><p></p><p>Only by becoming stronger can one protect one's loved ones.</p><p></p><p>Only by becoming stronger can one safeguard one's own dignity and freedom!</p><p></p><p>With these two as the foundation of his heart, step by step he would strengthen his will, and then feed that back into the true meaning of the Martial Dao, allowing himself to achieve advancement.</p><p></p><p>So what's next? Should he continue to protect? Ye Xiao felt that this was no longer the case.</p><p></p><p>The process of a martial artist's growth is one of detachment from the mundane.</p><p></p><p>Imagine, if you became so powerful that you could protect everyone with just a glance, could they still serve as the foundation of your spirit at that point? Clearly not.</p><p></p><p>If there is no sufficiently sturdy spiritual foundation, it's like losing the skeleton - how could the Martial Dao continue to improve? So he needed an even higher spiritual foundation to support his inner self, so that he would not lose himself even as his power grew ever greater.</p><p></p><p>This spiritual foundation would be to become stronger, endlessly stronger.</p><p></p><p>Strong to the point of being impervious to any person's delusions, and unbound by any power or any circumstance.</p><p></p><p>Not needing to consider anything else, just becoming stronger would grant him everything! His faith unwavering!</p><p></p><p>Thinking this, Ye Xiao suddenly felt his spiritual sea rumble.</p><p></p><p>The Profound Heavenly Might was rapidly rotating, and in his spiritual sea, spiritual lotus flowers bloomed.</p><p></p><p>In this moment, his spiritual power had once again undergone a tremendous increase.</p><p></p><p>His true Martial Dao had also achieved a great advancement!</p><p></p><p>His Martial Dao had already reached the level of the Innate Sixth Grade!</p><p></p><p>Advancement in cultivation is the fusion of spiritual energy power and the true Martial Dao. One cannot be lacking.</p><p></p><p>Previously, when Ye Xiao broke through from the Fourth Grade to the Fifth, his spiritual energy power had already reached the critical point, but his true Martial Dao had not broken through, so he could not step into the Innate Fifth Grade.</p><p></p><p>But now, his true Martial Dao had broken through to the Innate Sixth Grade in advance. As long as his spiritual energy power reaches the critical point, he can directly break through to the Innate Sixth Grade.</p><p></p><p>It's like in the college entrance exam - while others need to take the exam seriously, you've already secured an admission offer in advance.</p><p></p><p>Whether you take the exam or not no longer matters, because you are already destined to become a student at that top university.</p><p></p><p>Ye Xiao looked at the still-confused Fa Zheng, feeling a bit amused.</p><p></p><p>Fa Zheng had cultivated for sixty years, yet had never broken through this mental bottleneck, while he himself had broken through because of Fa Zheng.</p><p></p><p>Truly, the workings of fate are unfathomable.</p><p></p><p>[This chapter is complete.]</p>

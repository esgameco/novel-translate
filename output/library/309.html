        <h1>Chapter 309</h1>
        <div class="content">
            <p>Here is the full English translation of the Chinese excerpt:</p><p></p><p>Ye Xiao was right, this would be a prolonged battle, not something that could be easily weathered by just getting through one beast calamity.</p><p></p><p>It was very likely that after this, the entire human race world would only have the Nine States left.</p><p></p><p>Moreover, the beasts that the Nine States had to contend with would be ten, a hundred times stronger than the ones they had encountered before! So at this moment, the sacrifice of the weaker human tribes in the Nine States was not only draining the future and hope of the Nine States, but also indirectly adding to the power of the star beasts.</p><p></p><p>"We need greater power. But where can we find such power?"</p><p></p><p>A heavy oppression weighed on everyone's hearts.</p><p></p><p>After a moment, Ye Xiao took a deep breath and stepped forward to comfort everyone.</p><p></p><p>"There's no need to be so despondent, when the carriage reaches the mountain, a path will appear. Let's just take it one step at a time. The beast calamity is imminent, it's better to focus on what we need to do rather than just worrying here."</p><p></p><p>Qinglong nodded.</p><p></p><p>"I'll be responsible for the Long White Dragon Vein, the largest dragon vein in the Nine States. Those it can protect should be the most."</p><p></p><p>Zhuque and Baihu spoke up:</p><p></p><p>"We two will each take one Sword Saint, to guard a location. This way, we can cover two more places."</p><p></p><p>Xuanwu said:</p><p></p><p>"I'll team up with Beitung Ce from the Central State. Last time Beitung Ce saw Ye Xiao release his auspicious divine light, he also gained many insights and is likely to break through to the King Realm. Combining his eye techniques with my abilities, our defense and offense will be complete."</p><p></p><p>Ye Xiao nodded.</p><p></p><p>"With this, we can secure four locations. I can guard Jianghai City alone.</p><p></p><p>Actually, if we could cover two more places, it would be even better. The area we can protect is still too small with just us."</p><p></p><p>Qinglong spoke up:</p><p></p><p>"You mean you want the Celestial Emperors above the starry skies to come down? But I advise you not to try that.</p><p></p><p>The reason the beast calamity formed is because the starry skies battlefield couldn't withstand the pressure, and had to release some star beasts down here.</p><p></p><p>Although it's already difficult on the ground, it's even harder up in the starry skies.</p><p></p><p>So they definitely won't be coming down.</p><p></p><p>If they retreat, the entire pressure will fall on the ground, which the human race simply cannot bear."</p><p></p><p>Ye Xiao had indeed planned to do that, but hearing Qinglong's explanation, he could only give up on the idea.</p><p></p><p>"Alright, let's just arrange it this way then. I'll take care of the formation issues and complete it within a day. You all focus on gathering spirit stones to activate all the formations.</p><p></p><p>The Long White Dragon Vein and the Southwest Forest Sea won't need spirit stones, as they have dragon veins, which are far stronger than spirit stones."</p><p></p><p>"Understood."</p><p></p><p>During the conversation, Xuanwu seemed to sense something, and took out a small box that had been suppressed by the Xuanwu Talisman from his storage ring.</p><p></p><p>At this moment, everyone could clearly feel the violent fluctuations coming from within it.</p><p></p><p>Baihu was startled and couldn't help but speak up:</p><p></p><p>"Brother Xuanwu, isn't this the Star Beast we subdued together back then?"</p><p></p><p>Xuanwu nodded solemnly.</p><p></p><p>"All these years, this fellow has been trying to escape, and I've been using the Xuanwu Talisman to suppress it.</p><p></p><p>Last time, when I went to send Ye Xiao to the Long White Dragon Vein, I gave it a chance to escape. </p><p></p><p>It was only later that Ye Xiao set up a formation to restrain it, but this little box still couldn't be placed with spirit stones, so it couldn't be completely suppressed.</p><p></p><p>Now, it's about to break free again."</p><p></p><p>Ye Xiao spoke:</p><p></p><p>"Since it wants to come out so badly, let's just let it out. Today, with all the experts of the Nine States here, we can directly release it and make it an array eye, set up a formation to let it contribute to the defense of the Nine States.</p><p></p><p>That way, in the future when we're not around, Senior Xuanwu won't have to deal with it alone."</p><p></p><p>Senior Xuanwu nodded.</p><p></p><p>"You're right, since that's the case, let's satisfy it this once."</p><p></p><p>With that, Senior Xuanwu directly removed the Xuanwu Talisman.</p><p></p><p>Without the suppression of the Xuanwu Talisman, the ink-black box struggled more and more violently, and in the blink of an eye, it completely cracked open, and an extremely evil and bloodthirsty power burst out, forming a pure black little sea serpent.</p><p></p><p>"Hahaha, I'm finally out. How many years has it been? I can finally see the light of day again. Hahaha, Xuanwu child, aren't you going to surrender to me?"</p><p></p><p>Before he could finish speaking, the next moment, he fell silent, staring fixedly at all the people present.</p><p></p><p>"(⊙.⊙)!"</p><p></p><p>He was no fool, there were so many people sitting here, all staring at him, including Senior Xuanwu Chengchen, the human race White Tiger Senior who had once joined hands with Xuanwu to subdue him.</p><p></p><p>And these two were not sitting in the main seat or the upper seat, but in a slightly more secluded position.</p><p></p><p>Even a fool could understand that everyone in this room was definitely a King Realm expert!</p><p></p><p>Damn it! </p><p></p><p>He had just escaped and ended up in a King Realm nest?</p><p></p><p>How was this possible?</p><p></p><p>Here is the full English translation of the Chinese excerpt:</p><p></p><p>What's the matter? Even if he was extremely confident, there was no way he could think that with his own strength, he could suddenly fight against so many Monarch Realm experts!</p><p></p><p>"Gulp." He swallowed hard, carefully saying, "That is, did I come out at the wrong time? I want to go back now, can I still go back?"</p><p></p><p>Xuanwu pointed to the ink box under his feet.</p><p></p><p>"If you can turn it back to its original state, I'll let you crawl back in."</p><p></p><p>The little dragon serpent looked at the shattered ink box at his feet, and the corners of his mouth couldn't help but twitch violently.</p><p></p><p>Afterwards, he picked up the largest piece of the broken ink box and tried to reassemble it, but as soon as he held the largest piece, it crumbled into dust the next second.</p><p></p><p>The little dragon serpent's face couldn't help but twitch violently.</p><p></p><p>"Can I apply for a replacement ink box?"</p><p></p><p>Xuanwu punched him in the eye.</p><p></p><p>"I'll give you a coffin instead."</p><p></p><p>This punch was very heavy, mainly because the little dragon serpent didn't dare to release his spiritual energy to block it. With so many Monarch Realm experts here, he knew that if he dared to release his spiritual energy to block it, he would die a very miserable death.</p><p></p><p>The kind where you can't even find all your limbs.</p><p></p><p>So this punch directly knocked him unconscious, his head in a daze.</p><p></p><p>Until the moment he passed out, the little dragon serpent was still thinking, why was he so stupid and impatient? When should he not have crawled out? Of all times, he had to crawl out now.</p><p></p><p>Bumping into so many top-tier human race experts, if he didn't die, who would? </p><p></p><p>Balls of sorrow! After dealing with the little dragon serpent with a punch, Xuanwu threw him in front of Ye Xiao to be placed in the center of the spirit gathering formation.</p><p></p><p>Afterwards, everyone arranged their respective tasks.</p><p></p><p>Ye Xiao went to set up formations in various places.</p><p></p><p>Of course, when it's said "various places", it's actually only five locations, and the formation in Jianghai City has already been set up by him, he only needs to expand it a little.</p><p></p><p>The other few places are one in the Long White Dragon Vein, and one in the Southwest Forest Sea.</p><p></p><p>There are two other places, one in Zhongzhou City, and one set in Hu City.</p><p></p><p>In this way, a parallel quadrilateral formed by the northeast, east, central, west, and southwest five directions.</p><p></p><p>The five places all have transmission formations connected, and the warriors inside can teleport to another defensive location at any time.</p><p></p><p>No matter which place is attacked, the other places can rush over to provide assistance in time.</p><p></p><p>To ensure that everyone can jointly resist the coming disaster.</p><p></p><p>On the side of the Nine States Alliance, they also announced the impending arrival of the beast disaster to all the states around the world.</p><p></p><p>This was also Ye Xiao's suggestion.</p><p></p><p>He himself is not fond of these barbarians, as in his previous life and this life, they have done too many outrageous things to the Nine States.</p><p></p><p>Even if they were wiped out, Ye Xiao wouldn't feel a bit of pity.</p><p></p><p>Because Ye Xiao knows that if the Nine States were wiped out, they wouldn't feel a bit of pity either, and they might even secretly laugh and mock.</p><p></p><p>But there is one very important issue.</p><p></p><p>That is, if they are defeated too quickly, the star beasts will use their fresh blood to refine divine blood and create more super divine beasts.</p><p></p><p>This is also a huge threat to the Nine States.</p><p></p><p>So Ye Xiao felt it necessary to remind them, so that they could prepare in advance.</p><p></p><p>In this way, no matter whether they can resist the star beasts or not, they can at least inflict heavy casualties on the star beasts.</p><p></p><p>Even if they can only resist for a little longer, it would be good, giving the Nine States more time to breathe, or in other words, giving him more time to develop.</p><p></p><p>If his strength can be raised to the level of the old-line Empyrean Realm, he might consider taking on multiple opponents and directly killing a few star beasts.</p><p></p><p>Ye Xiao's current state is just at the initial stage of the Empyrean Realm, and he will not act rashly before fully understanding the difference in cultivation between himself and the enemy.</p><p></p><p>Being cautious is always better.</p><p></p><p>And when this news was transmitted, it immediately caused a huge uproar throughout the world.</p><p></p><p>The beast disaster that was supposed to start in more than three years was about to descend in front of them, and whoever it was, they could not bear it.</p><p></p><p>Countless TV and media outlets reported extensively.</p><p></p><p>Some people loudly proclaimed that this was the twilight of the human race.</p><p></p><p>Some remained calm, believing that the human race should unite and quickly come up with countermeasures.</p><p></p><p>But there were also some eccentric Americans who said that this news was a false message released by the Nine States, with the purpose of creating panic in order to raise the prices of weapons, elixirs, and the like.</p><p></p><p>After all, the Nine States itself is a major state for refining elixirs and weapons.</p><p></p><p>There were even some who solemnly propagated some conspiracy theories, saying that the star beasts would not actually descend, and that people should just eat and drink, without needing to pay attention to it at all.</p><p></p><p>As for these idiots, Ye Xiao couldn't be bothered to deal with them.</p><p></p><p>They always advocate democracy and freedom, so idiots also have the freedom of speech.</p>

        <h1>Chapter 351</h1>
        <div class="content">
            <p>Here is the full English translation of the Chinese excerpt:</p><p></p><p>Overall, this trip to the ancestral tomb of the human race has yielded a harvest that cannot be described as anything less than massive.</p><p></p><p>This time, Ye Xiao has obtained so much!</p><p></p><p>First, he was able to determine the reason why he could not become a god, and with the help of the ancestors, he successfully resolved this issue, raising the divine blood within him to over a million drops, allowing him to achieve perfect harmony with the divine soul.</p><p></p><p>He then activated the divine eyes, although he doesn't know exactly what they are.</p><p></p><p>However, since the ancestors have emphasized it so much, it must be something quite remarkable.</p><p></p><p>In addition to that, he also learned about the Divine Treasure Vault.</p><p></p><p>Ye Xiao has decided that he must strive to reach the Divine Realm as soon as possible!</p><p></p><p>Only by reaching the Divine Realm will he have a chance to find the Kunlun Dragon Vein and locate the Divine Treasure Vault.</p><p></p><p>Many years ago, although the ancestors said they found the Divine Treasure Vault by sheer coincidence, their cultivation at the time was already at the Divine Realm.</p><p></p><p>With his current Emperor Realm cultivation, there is a 100% chance that he will not be able to find the Kunlun Dragon Vein.</p><p></p><p>He will set a short-term goal first - to enter the Divine Realm. Then, his long-term goal will be to find the Divine Treasure Vault.</p><p></p><p>If he can beat the others to it and find the Divine Treasure Vault, and obtain the treasures within, he might just be able to cultivate himself into an existence at the Divine Emperor level.</p><p></p><p>If that were the case, it would be perfect.</p><p></p><p>Divine Emperor! Just the thought of it fills Ye Xiao with a sense of beauty.</p><p></p><p>If his guess is correct, the Divine Emperor should be the mightiest existence in the starry sky.</p><p></p><p>As long as he can reach that realm, even if he doesn't do much, with the support of the Xuanyuan Clan, it should be enough for him to live a peaceful life in the future.</p><p></p><p>Currently, there are two issues he needs to overcome to achieve divinity.</p><p></p><p>The first is the issue of spiritual energy.</p><p></p><p>The ancestors have said that to succeed in the final breakthrough to become a god, he will need an immense amount of spiritual energy.</p><p></p><p>Relying solely on absorbing spiritual energy within his body will not be enough, unless he has a supreme-grade cultivation method.</p><p></p><p>But without reaching the Divine Realm, he cannot further refine the divine scriptures within the Golden Book, so how could he possibly obtain a supreme-grade technique?</p><p></p><p>This is a paradox.</p><p></p><p>This is where spirit pills and spiritual gathering formations come into play.</p><p></p><p>With the star beasts he has, as well as the abundant celestial materials and treasures, refining a divine pill should not be too difficult for him.</p><p></p><p>The next step is to wait until his pill refining technique is successfully fused and fully cultivated, then he can start making preparations.</p><p></p><p>The other issue is formations.</p><p></p><p>He currently has four formations - the Earthly Calamity and Heavenly Talisman Formation, the Grand Heavenly Origin Formation, the Heavenly Transformation Creation Formation, and the Brilliant Luo Emperor Formation. </p><p></p><p>However, only the Grand Heavenly Origin Formation is a spiritual gathering formation, while the others do not have this effect.</p><p></p><p>Ye Xiao urgently needs to find another technique to fuse.</p><p></p><p>As long as he can find another technique to fuse, he will be able to create a divine formation.</p><p></p><p>At that time, the power of the spiritual gathering formation will rapidly increase.</p><p></p><p>Perfect!</p><p></p><p>The days ahead are filled with motivation once again.</p><p></p><p>After leaving Kunlun, the three parted ways and returned to their respective places.</p><p></p><p>Ye Xiao also returned to Jianghai City.</p><p></p><p>The good news is that as soon as he returned to Jianghai City, the three Emperor Realm pill refining techniques he had were all successfully fused.</p><p></p><p>He has created a Divine Technique-level pill refining method - the Divine Luo Pill.</p><p></p><p>This pill refining technique has consolidated the characteristics of three pill refining arts - it possesses the ultimate power to refine impurities, the ability to forcefully suppress spiritual energy, and the capacity to perfectly enhance the quality of pills.</p><p></p><p>These three powerful abilities combined mean that Ye Xiao can refine even a pile of cow dung into a pill, extracting all the nutritional elements and then upgrading the pill.</p><p></p><p>In this way, the value of the pill can be increased exponentially beyond that of a mere pile of cow dung.</p><p></p><p>Entering the Jade Seal, Ye Xiao sees that Huan Liuli is diligently cultivating, still wearing her maid outfit with cat ears and black stockings, which are Balenciaga.</p><p></p><p>This silly cat, she never has a proper demeanor, and even when she's being serious, she still seems a bit unserious.</p><p></p><p>A combination of silliness and middle-school-level edginess, with a touch of... well, never mind.</p><p></p><p>The fact that she's able to start cultivating seriously is already quite praiseworthy, considering cats are naturally lazy, and her intelligence is not the highest.</p><p></p><p>Sensing his presence, Huan Liuli opens her eyes.</p><p></p><p>"Master!"</p><p></p><p>Huan Liuli excitedly gets up and comes in front of Ye Xiao, raising her little arms.</p><p></p><p>"Master, look at me, my cultivation has advanced again. I've finally broken through to the Divine Beast Realm."</p><p></p><p>Ye Xiao nods and gives a perfunctory compliment.</p><p></p><p>"Mm, not bad."</p><p></p><p>"Hey, Master, would you like to test my current strength?"</p><p></p><p>"How? By letting you hit me?"</p><p></p><p>"No no no!" </p><p></p><p>Huan Liuli quickly waves her hands.</p><p></p><p>"Master is joking, I would never dare to hit you. It should be you hitting me, like giving me a light tap, to test how much I can endure."</p><p></p><p>"It will hurt."</p><p></p><p>"It's fine, it won't hurt too much."</p><p></p><p>Here is the full English translation of the excerpt from the Chinese novel:</p><p></p><p>"Master, a little lighter please."</p><p></p><p>"Where should I hit?"</p><p></p><p>"Master, you can hit anywhere you want, as long as it's a fleshy part of the body. The areas with less flesh will be very painful if you hit the bone."</p><p></p><p>Ye Xiao looked her up and down.</p><p></p><p>Hmm, this area has the most flesh, but since it exceeds the normal standard, hitting it will definitely reduce the effect, the experiment won't be accurate.</p><p></p><p>This area has a bit less flesh, but it's the softest, never mind, the position is not good, not suitable.</p><p></p><p>This area, hmm, good, decided, it's you.</p><p></p><p>"Are you ready? I'm going to start!"</p><p></p><p>Huan Liuli nodded excitedly, her face flushed with excitement.</p><p></p><p>"Start! I'm ready."</p><p></p><p>"It will hurt a lot, are you sure you want me to hit you?"</p><p></p><p>"I'm sure, I want to see how strong my Spiritual Beast Realm cultivation is."</p><p></p><p>"Slap—!"</p><p></p><p>Huan Liuli: "(╯#-_-)╯╧═╧!"</p><p></p><p>Ye Xiao slapped Huan Liuli's face. This area had just the right amount of flesh, the position should be the most suitable, after all, Huan Liuli was a female cat, he had to be a little careful, and the experimental effect would also be the best.</p><p></p><p>Hearing that crisp slapping sound, how loud! How round? The sound that entered the ear was just right, wonderful! Awesome!</p><p></p><p>Looking at the flushed little face, under this slap, it was swollen just right, red as can be, just like a baby's face.</p><p></p><p>And Huan Liuli was stunned by this slap.</p><p></p><p>She looked at her master blankly, and Ye Xiao couldn't help but raise his eyebrows.</p><p></p><p>"Why are you looking at me like that? It was you who told me to hit you. It's not like I wanted to hit you. And you said I could hit anywhere."</p><p></p><p>"So you just hit my face. Can't you hit my butt? My arms? My thighs? My stomach?"</p><p></p><p>"You didn't tell me where to hit! You just told me to hit you. If you wanted me to hit other places, you should have said so earlier! If you had said so earlier, I wouldn't have hit your face. Why didn't you say so earlier?"</p><p></p><p>Huan Liuli cried, two clear tears falling from the corners of her eyes.</p><p></p><p>Why did she make such a stupid request?</p><p></p><p>If she had known it would be like this, even if it meant being beaten to death, she wouldn't have let her master experiment on her current strength.</p><p></p><p>"So how is my cultivation now? Is it very powerful?"</p><p></p><p>"Well, I actually only used half my strength just now. But your face is swollen, and it's swollen really badly. It looks like a pig's head. So how strong your strength is, you can judge for yourself."</p><p></p><p>"Then I should still be very strong, after all, the master is very strong. But I was able to withstand the master's half-strength slap, my face only swelled a little, no big deal."</p><p></p><p>As soon as the words left her mouth, two streams of blood gushed out of Huan Liuli's nostrils.</p><p></p><p>Ye Xiao: "(_..)!"</p><p></p><p>"Your nose is bleeding, do you want me to treat you?"</p><p></p><p>Huan Liuli wiped the blood from her nose.</p><p></p><p>"No big deal, no major problem. I feel my condition is very good now, I can even accept another trial from the master, as long as you don't hit my face again."</p><p></p><p>Ye Xiao was still worried.</p><p></p><p>"Your face is turning pale, are you sure you're okay?"</p><p></p><p>"Of course!"</p><p></p><p>Huan Liuli put her hands on her hips, striking a rather cool pose.</p><p></p><p>"Your forehead is sweating, let me treat you."</p><p></p><p>"No need, I'm fine! I'm really fine. Look, I'm doing well now! I'm already a powerful Spiritual Beast Realm expert! Your half-strength slap is something I can still endure."</p><p></p><p>Ye Xiao said slowly, "Alright then! I'll go take care of other matters, you can take care of your face later."</p><p></p><p>"No problem..."</p><p></p><p>With a thud, as soon as the words left her mouth, Huan Liuli collapsed to the ground, foaming at the mouth, eyes rolling back.</p><p></p><p>Ye Xiao: "(_..)!"</p><p></p><p>He had almost forgotten, this silly cat not only had low intelligence and a rather simple mind, but also a very stubborn mouth, the hardest kind.</p><p></p><p>Sigh! He'd better treat her.</p><p></p><p>Ye Xiao waved his hand and shot a healing spell at her, instantly repairing her injuries.</p><p></p><p>Huan Liuli opened her eyes and continued lying on the ground without getting up.</p><p></p><p>"Master, why haven't you left yet? I'm just resting here for a bit. You don't really think I fainted, do you? I definitely won't faint! Go take care of your own business."</p><p></p><p>Ye Xiao: "(_..)!"</p><p></p><p>Okay, he couldn't continue communicating with this silly cat anymore, he'll just let her be.</p><p></p><p>He headed towards the area where the Super Spiritual Beasts and Spiritual Beasts were being held, while Huan Liuli was furiously rubbing her face.</p><p></p><p>Although the healing spell could heal the injuries, Ye Xiao, in order to punish her foolishness, did not heal her pain. The bone-deep pain Huan Liuli just experienced had not subsided yet.</p><p></p><p>"Damn it! It hurts so much! I'm dying of pain! Why did I have to act tough? I shouldn't have asked the master, such an overpowered existence, I should have found a regular Spiritual Beast instead, I'm such an idiot! Ouch, it hurts!"</p>

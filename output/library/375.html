        <h1>Chapter 375</h1>
        <div class="content">
            <p>Here is the full English translation of the Chinese excerpt:</p><p></p><p>Ye Xiao casually tossed the two small booklets into the flames, and along with the fire, they were burned to ashes.</p><p></p><p>In this way, the news about the Divine Treasure Vault was gone.</p><p></p><p>Accompanied by the constantly tempering flames, the body of that Divine King was ultimately burned to a pile of ashes.</p><p></p><p>Normally, with Ye Xiao's strength, it would be impossible for him to burn a Divine King's body to ashes.</p><p></p><p>But the other party had existed for countless years, and the vital energy in their body had long been consumed, leaving only a tiny bit remaining. That's why Ye Xiao could easily refine them completely.</p><p></p><p>After the burning, the Divine King's corpse completely disappeared, leaving only several million drops of divine blood!</p><p></p><p>This made Ye Xiao sigh involuntarily, "No wonder they are a Divine King, they are far more powerful than the ancestors of the human race."</p><p></p><p>The more than 20 human race ancestors had only been dead for 5,000 years, and their divine bodies only had 100,000 drops of fresh blood left. But this Divine King, whose death was unknown, could refine out several million drops of divine blood - the gap between them was truly too vast.</p><p></p><p>The next moment, Ye Xiao absorbed all the divine blood into his own body, and as soon as the several million drops of divine blood entered his body, a huge fluctuation of spiritual energy occurred within him.</p><p></p><p>Boom!</p><p></p><p>Accompanied by a light sound, he broke through to the fourth realm of the Divine Boundary. After going back, refining it further would allow him to greatly increase his cultivation.</p><p></p><p>However, Ye Xiao felt that he also needed to speed things up.</p><p></p><p>Because this Divine King's tomb might contain information about the Ancient Divine Kingdom, who knows what other Divine King's tombs might also record about the Ancient Divine Kingdom?</p><p></p><p>The Ancient Divine Kings in the Ancient Divine Kingdom were not just one.</p><p></p><p>Afterwards, Ye Xiao began to repair the formation array again, so that if someone else came later, they wouldn't discover the abnormality in the Divine King's tomb. At the very least, it would take them some time to decipher it, buying him more time.</p><p></p><p>On the other side, Emperor Dragon Lion and the others were hurrying to move the things outside. Suddenly, Emperor Dragon Lion spoke up, "What should I do? I need to pee."</p><p></p><p>Illusion Jade Glass looked disgusted. </p><p></p><p>"You're really a lazy donkey, always needing to pee when others don't. People have the three urgencies, managing the heavens and the earth, how can they manage your shitting and farting?"</p><p></p><p>"Don't talk nonsense, you're just wasting the master's time."</p><p></p><p>After saying that, Illusion Jade Glass casually picked up a medicinal pill bottle, opened the cap, and gulped down the pills, then handed the empty bottle to him.</p><p></p><p>"Here! Go solve it in the corner, don't make a stinky mess and delay everyone's work."</p><p></p><p>"Thank you, thank you."</p><p></p><p>Emperor Dragon Lion took the medicinal pill bottle and ran to the corner to relieve himself, shivering.</p><p></p><p>"Ahh! That feels good. It's just a waste of such a good medicinal pill bottle."</p><p></p><p>At this time, Illusion Jade Glass shouted loudly, "Lion, are you done? We're about to leave!"</p><p></p><p>"Coming, coming!"</p><p></p><p>Emperor Dragon Lion placed the medicinal pill bottle in the corner, then quickly caught up.</p><p></p><p>Ye Xiao had already come out of the tomb, seeing the group, he spoke indifferently, "Is the work all done?"</p><p></p><p>"Reporting to the master, everything is taken care of."</p><p></p><p>Ye Xiao nodded.</p><p></p><p>"Since that's the case, we can go back now. Be sure not to leave any traces, clean up all the footprints, even a single hair cannot be left behind."</p><p></p><p>"Understood!"</p><p></p><p>The group of spirit beasts responded in unison. Ye Xiao gathered them into the jade talisman and completely left the Divine King's tomb.</p><p></p><p>Ye Xiao returned to Jianghai City, and his days resumed their tranquility. During the day, he continued to read books in the library, because the Divine King's tomb did not contain many cultivation techniques, mostly just cultivation resources.</p><p></p><p>At night, he constantly refined the divine blood within him, turning it all into his own divine blood.</p><p></p><p>In this way, after four days, Ye Xiao had refined nearly a quarter of the divine blood. His cultivation broke through another realm, reaching the fifth realm of the Divine Boundary.</p><p></p><p>It is estimated that if he fully refines it all, his cultivation will be able to advance to the eighth realm of the Divine Boundary within the next month.</p><p></p><p>Perfect. </p><p></p><p>This Divine King's tomb has earned him a lot.</p><p></p><p>Ye Xiao couldn't help but look forward to what treasures might be in the Divine Treasure Vault.</p><p></p><p>At this time, his Golden Book Spiritual Sense had also completely cultivated that divine-level healing art.</p><p></p><p>The papers recording the four divine arts had all turned into pure golden yellow.</p><p></p><p>It can be combined now.</p><p></p><p>Ye Xiao directly clicked to initiate the combination.</p><p></p><p>The combination would take several more days, but since it was an Ancient Precious Art, spending a few days was to be expected.</p><p></p><p>That day, Ye Xiao was normally reading books in the library, when he suddenly felt many powerful auras descending upon Jianghai City.</p><p></p><p>These auras contained many Emperor Realm cultivators, and even some Divine Realm cultivators, their cultivation not low at all. The strength of their forces had completely surpassed the level that Xuan Yuan Ning had brought before.</p><p></p><p>"What is this...?"</p><p></p><p>Ye Xiao raised his eyebrows slightly, taking out his Spiritual Sense Stone to contact Bei Tang Ce, wanting to see if he knew what was going on. "Hey, Ye Xiao, what's the matter?"</p><p></p><p>"Senior Bei Tang, have you sensed the arrival of many powerful auras?"</p><p></p><p>Here is the full English translation of the Chinese excerpt:</p><p></p><p>"You're talking about this matter? It's like this, the young master of the Ning family has gathered the young masters of other direct lineage families of the Xuanyuan Clan to come and explore the divine tomb together."</p><p></p><p>Ye Xiao couldn't help but feel puzzled.</p><p></p><p>"How could such a thing happen? He doesn't flaunt his wealth, but secretly gets rich, yet he's not low-key and discreet, and instead tells so many people about it? And even if he's worried that others will snatch it, with the Ning family's strength, they can definitely send an extremely powerful expert over, right!"</p><p></p><p>"I heard that many other divine clans have also come to this star domain. Apparently, the territories originally belonging to the Western Wing Clan, the Thunder Clan descendants, and the Southern Gigantopithecus Clan descendants, have all been occupied by other divine clans, totaling over a hundred divine clans.</p><p></p><p>Of course, some of them are relatively low-ranking.</p><p></p><p>However, even though they are low-ranking, when added together, they still form a formidable force that cannot be underestimated!"</p><p></p><p>Ye Xiao finally understood.</p><p></p><p>There are simply too many divine tombs in this area, and for the Ning family to try to monopolize them all is somewhat unrealistic.</p><p></p><p>Because the three clans also know about these divine tombs.</p><p></p><p>Even if they can't defeat the Ning family, they will definitely bring in others.</p><p></p><p>This way, although they may harvest a little less, it's still much better than them getting nothing at all.</p><p></p><p>And with this arrangement, even if the Ning family has powerful experts, it would be difficult for them to monopolize so many divine tombs, including the Divine King's Tomb.</p><p></p><p>Rather than doing that, it's better to invite other direct lineage families of the Xuanyuan Clan to jointly harvest the divine tombs.</p><p></p><p>This way, they not only ensure their own safety, but also gain favors and increase their allies.</p><p></p><p>It seems that this Ning Zhiyuan's brain is quite useful.</p><p></p><p>At this time, the voice of Beitang Ce came through the phone again.</p><p></p><p>"Ye Xiao, with the arrival of these many divine clans, the forces we have joined have also undergone many changes.</p><p></p><p>The Ning family has already recruited Jing Di, the Four Sages, as well as a batch of excellent warriors like me and the Sword Saint.</p><p></p><p>From now on, we belong to a branch of the Ning family, and the resources we obtain will be more than ordinary people.</p><p></p><p>Do you want to consider joining the Ning family as well? The young master of the Ning family is quite good. If you join the Ning family, I think they should give you extensive cultivation resources."</p><p></p><p>Ye Xiao immediately refused.</p><p></p><p>"I'll pass, I'm used to being independent and don't like to get entangled with too many things."</p><p></p><p>With his current talent, and the Divine Nation's Treasure Trove, he is very likely to break through to an extremely high level within ten years. Joining the Ning family would not be beneficial for him.</p><p></p><p>Joining means he has to accept others' resources, and after accepting the Ning family's resources, he would have to lend a hand if they encounter difficulties in the future. That would actually be a burden for him.</p><p></p><p>"Alright then, but in the future if you have anything you need, you can still tell us just like before."</p><p></p><p>Ye Xiao nodded.</p><p></p><p>"I understand. You all should also let me know if you have any difficulties."</p><p></p><p>"Okay."</p><p></p><p>After ending the call, Ye Xiao felt a very obvious fluctuation coming from the Golden Book within him, and then the speed of his absorption of spiritual energy became even faster.</p><p></p><p>Ye Xiao's face lit up with joy.</p><p></p><p>He knew that his second precious technique had just been successfully synthesized.</p><p></p><p>Without any extra thoughts, Ye Xiao immediately immersed himself in contemplation and began to examine his second precious technique.</p><p></p><p>The Immortality Technique!</p><p></p><p>Very powerful!</p><p></p><p>Just from the name, Ye Xiao knew that this technique was definitely extraordinary.</p><p></p><p>He carefully examined the information within it.</p><p></p><p>The Immortality Technique possesses both defensive capabilities that refine the soul and body, as well as a continuous healing effect.</p><p></p><p>After mastering this technique, even if the opponent can break through his defenses and inflict damage on him, he can instantly recover the injuries in the next moment.</p><p></p><p>No wonder it's called the Immortality Technique, this method is simply amazing.</p><p></p><p>The Golden Book has already started to automatically cultivate it, and it is estimated that in a few days, the Immortality Technique will be cultivated to the Great Perfection realm. At that time, with it constantly operating within his body, it will allow him to absorb a huge amount of spiritual energy, bringing about massive improvements.</p><p></p><p>Now, he has his healing technique, attack technique, and defensive technique. Next, he should go cultivate some movement techniques.</p><p></p><p>As the saying goes, "All martial arts have no unbreakable defense, only the fastest can prevail."</p><p></p><p>By further improving his movement techniques, whether it's for sneak attacks or escaping, it will be a great benefit for him.</p><p></p><p>However, before that, Ye Xiao still needs to figure out how to deal with the matter of the Divine Nation's Treasure Trove.</p><p></p><p>The excavation progress of the Divine Nation's Treasure Trove has now reached 15%, with 85% of the progress still remaining.</p><p></p><p>Now that Ning Zhiyuan has suddenly summoned so many direct lineage members of the Xuanyuan Clan, along with nearly a hundred other divine clans, to jointly excavate the divine tombs, it won't be long before they find the Divine King's Tomb.</p><p></p><p>If any of the Divine King's Tombs contain records about the Divine Nation's Treasure Trove and transmit that information out, that would be a huge problem for him.</p><p></p><p>But to speed up the progress, he needs to increase the manpower. Where can he find workers who are capable and can be trusted not to betray him?</p>

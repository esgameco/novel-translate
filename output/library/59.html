        <h1>Chapter 59</h1>
        <div class="content">
            <p>Here is the full English translation of the Chinese excerpt:</p><p></p><p>When it reaches the Great Perfection realm during its cultivation, the ten sheets of paper imprinted with the foundational healing techniques will emit a pure golden light.</p><p></p><p>At that time, they can be combined.</p><p></p><p>After completing the healing techniques, Ye Xiao is currently able to take a breather.</p><p></p><p>However, he did not rest, but continued to read other types of books.</p><p></p><p>This time, Ye Xiao plans to study body cultivation techniques.</p><p></p><p>Previously, he had calculated that for the life-saving techniques, the alchemy and forging types require higher financial resources, so he temporarily put them aside and first cultivated the healing techniques.</p><p></p><p>Now, he plans to cultivate the body techniques as well.</p><p></p><p>As the saying goes, it's better to be able to run than to fight.</p><p></p><p>Among the Thirty-Six Stratagems, retreating is the best strategy! He doesn't necessarily have to be able to defeat others in combat, as long as he can run fast enough that others can't catch up, that would also be a good way to save his life.</p><p></p><p>Ye Xiao had already learned two foundational body cultivation techniques.</p><p></p><p>However, the foundational techniques are far from meeting his requirements. Only the top-tier techniques after synthesis can catch his attention.</p><p></p><p>After Ye Xiao finished reading, Ning Yuhen also quickly started reading.</p><p></p><p>But he soon frowned.</p><p></p><p>The reason why cultivation techniques are divided into different levels is not only due to the vast differences in their strength and power, but also to cater to the needs of beginner martial artists.</p><p></p><p>If one doesn't start from the lower-level martial arts, it would be very difficult.</p><p></p><p>The higher-level techniques contain profound martial dao philosophies that are beyond the comprehension of lower-level martial artists.</p><p></p><p>Ye Xiao often encounters many cultivation techniques that he completely fails to understand when reading books.</p><p></p><p>But he only needs to read through them once, and his divine soul will automatically record and comprehend them. He doesn't need to understand it himself, as long as his divine soul understands, he has understood it.</p><p></p><p>And after he comprehends it, creating new techniques becomes very simple.</p><p></p><p>The two cultivation manuals he created for Ning Yuhen were both sword techniques, although they were Extraordinary-grade, they were actually almost at the Grandmaster level, or rather, the Sub-Grandmaster level!</p><p></p><p>Cultivation techniques at this level, even in the library, are placed on the fourth floor, guarded by sentries, and ordinary people are not allowed to casually read them.</p><p></p><p>Only those who have accomplished great feats or are specially recommended by the City Lord's Manor are qualified to access such techniques.</p><p></p><p>The unfinished family sword technique that Dou Changfeng previously donated to the Northern Martial Arts Academy was also at the Sub-Grandmaster level.</p><p></p><p>Therefore, Sub-Grandmaster level cultivation techniques are extremely precious and rare, and not something that can be easily learned.</p><p></p><p>Ye Xiao didn't think too much about it, mainly because his own cultivation techniques were far too high-level, surpassing the Grandmaster level by countless tiers. After mastering a technique, his comprehension of the Dao of the Sword would naturally be far beyond that of ordinary mortals, and he felt that he had already written them as poorly as possible.</p><p></p><p>But for ordinary people of a different dimension, the "trash" he casually wrote is still a precious cultivation technique that they can only dream of.</p><p></p><p>Just as Ning Yuhen was struggling with the book, a steady male voice suddenly reached his ears.</p><p></p><p>"Hello, may I ask how I can borrow books if I'm not a citizen of Jianghai City?"</p><p></p><p>Ning Yuhen looked up and raised his eyebrows slightly.</p><p></p><p>"Hmm, I feel like I've seen you somewhere before."</p><p></p><p>The other party's expression remained calm. "It's possible you've seen me online before? There were some posts and news about me previously."</p><p></p><p>Ning Yuhen suddenly stood up.</p><p></p><p>"Ah, I remember now. You're Pao Jiansheng! The sword dao genius from Hanzhou who swept the sword dao geniuses of Jingzhou!"</p><p></p><p>Pao Jiansheng nodded.</p><p></p><p>"I am indeed Pao Jiansheng, but it's not that exaggerated to say I swept the sword dao geniuses of Jingzhou.</p><p></p><p>Jingzhou has many sword dao geniuses stronger than me. It's just that when we're all suppressed at the same level, my comprehension of the Dao of the Sword is slightly better.</p><p></p><p>If we were to go all-out, there are quite a few whose true combat power surpasses mine.</p><p></p><p>Their sword dao attainments may be slightly inferior, but their spiritual cultivation is stronger than mine. It's the rule of suppressing cultivation that allows me to gain an advantage."</p><p></p><p>"That's quite rare, everyone says the Hanzhou people are all arrogant and have boasting skills, but you're actually so humble. And your Central State language is so fluent."</p><p></p><p>"Actually, I only have one-eighth Hanzhou bloodline. Seven-eighths of me is from the Central State."</p><p></p><p>Here is the full English translation of the Chinese excerpt:</p><p></p><p>Bloodline. However, your words were a bit impolite. It's true that most people in Hanzhou are quite shameless, but you didn't have to say that in front of me, after all I grew up in Hanzhou.</p><p></p><p>And from another perspective, the people of Hanzhou are originally from the Nine Prefectures, it's just that a small group of them migrated to Hanzhou in the past.</p><p></p><p>The people of Hanzhou are also descendants of the Nine Prefectures. The culture of Hanzhou is also basically plagiarized from the Han culture of the Nine Prefectures, from this you should understand.</p><p></p><p>Ning Yuhen's face suddenly flushed.</p><p></p><p>"I was too abrupt, I apologize."</p><p></p><p>"I accept your apology."</p><p></p><p>Ning Yuhen heaved a sigh of relief, then spoke:</p><p></p><p>"I was actually thinking of becoming your fan before, but since you are from Hanzhou, my patriotic feelings are quite strong, so I didn't become your fan. Now that you have seven-eighths Central Plains bloodline, I think I can become your fan. Can I ask for an autographed photo?"</p><p></p><p>Park Jiansheng was silent for a moment, then nodded.</p><p></p><p>"Great, I'll go get my instant camera, just wait a moment."</p><p></p><p>Ning Yuhen quickly went to his cabinet, he usually likes photography, so he carries his own instant camera, taking photos and printing them out immediately, very convenient.</p><p></p><p>Park Jiansheng stood in place waiting, his gaze swept over the cultivation method Ning Yuhen had spread out, and his pupils suddenly contracted.</p><p></p><p>"Hmm? This is..."</p><p></p><p>He stepped forward and took a closer look, then took a deep breath.</p><p></p><p>"Good sword technique! As expected of the Nine Prefectures, although it's just a transcendent-level cultivation method, the exquisiteness of it is already approaching the level of a grandmaster, it can be considered a sub-grandmaster sword technique.</p><p></p><p>This is just the ordinary floor of a small library in Jianghai City, what kind of earth-shattering cultivation methods could be upstairs? How many are there in the entire Nine Prefectures?"</p><p></p><p>"I'm here, I'm here. Mr. Park, I'm here."</p><p></p><p>Ning Yuhen quickly came over with the camera, but Park Jiansheng asked first, "Is this sword technique from the library?"</p><p></p><p>Ning Yuhen paused, then pointed to Ye Xiao not far away.</p><p></p><p>"No, this is a cultivation method given to me by my supervisor, to exchange with me."</p><p></p><p>Park Jiansheng glanced at Ye Xiao, somewhat stunned, using such a high-level cultivation method for an exchange? Could it be that he's gone mad? He immediately picked up the cultivation method and walked towards Ye Xiao.</p><p></p><p>"Sir, are these two cultivation methods yours?"</p><p></p><p>Ye Xiao looked up, saw that it was Park Jiansheng, and just nodded.</p><p></p><p>"What's wrong?"</p><p></p><p>"I want to know, did you write these two cultivation methods yourself? Or...?"</p><p></p><p>Ye Xiao's heart skipped a beat, why is Park Jiansheng so interested in these two cultivation methods? They're just two transcendent-level cultivation methods, right? He has already tried his best to write them as poorly as possible, could it be... that he has revealed something?  He shook his head.</p><p></p><p>"No, I didn't. I haven't even awakened my spiritual sense, I'm only at the innate second rank, how could I possibly write out cultivation methods? I bought these from someone else."</p><p></p><p>"I see."</p><p></p><p>Park Jiansheng understood, that's why Ye Xiao would use such precious sword techniques for an exchange, it's because his cultivation is too low and he can't appreciate the value of these cultivation methods, otherwise he definitely wouldn't have used them for a trade.</p><p></p><p>"Then who did you buy this cultivation method from?"</p><p></p><p>"Uh."</p><p></p><p>Ye Xiao pondered for a moment, it seems he overdid it a bit. Oh well, time to employ the scapegoat technique! Thinking of this, he immediately spoke seriously, "His name is Zhang San!"</p><p></p><p>"Zhang San?"</p><p></p><p>Park Jiansheng's brow furrowed.</p><p></p><p>"That can't be right, someone who can write out this kind of cultivation method, how could his name be so ordinary? He should be a renowned senior in the jianghu!"</p><p></p><p>Ye Xiao pondered again, then spoke,</p><p></p><p>"He has a nickname, called the Rogue Cultivator!"</p><p></p><p>(This is the end of the chapter)</p>

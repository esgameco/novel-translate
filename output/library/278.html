        <h1>Chapter 278</h1>
        <div class="content">
            <p>Here is the full English translation of the Chinese excerpt:</p><p></p><p>"It's getting late! We should hurry up and start working, repairing what needs to be repaired down below! There are also a large number of citizens waiting outside."</p><p></p><p>"That's right, I'll start the repairs right away."</p><p></p><p>Li Liushui took the lead in going down to make the repairs, while Beitang Ce cupped his hands and bid farewell, saying, "Since the matters here have been resolved, then I'll take my leave first. The Central Plains cannot be without a peak Shenzu warrior stationed there, and moreover, the divine light released by Mr. Ye has also allowed me to gain some insights. Perhaps when I return, I'll have the chance to attempt a breakthrough to the King Realm."</p><p></p><p>"We'll meet again."</p><p></p><p>"We'll meet again."</p><p></p><p>Beitang Ce turned and left. On Ye Xiao's side, he and Jiang Chen had already descended to the entrance of the library, and Jiang Chen couldn't help but ask in puzzlement, "Aren't you going home?"</p><p></p><p>"I still have a personal matter to take care of."</p><p></p><p>When Ye Xiao was in the sky earlier, he had already sensed that his breeding ground formation had been destroyed, but the star beasts had not escaped. </p><p></p><p>Although he didn't know the exact reason, he still needed to come down and repair the formation.</p><p></p><p>Otherwise, if these Shenzu-level star beast experts were to escape, it would definitely bring a lot of trouble.</p><p></p><p>"Personal matter?"</p><p></p><p>Jiang Chen couldn't help but look at him with a puzzled expression.</p><p></p><p>Ye Xiao pointed to the crack next to the statue.</p><p></p><p>"I've been raising some star beasts down there to supplement my own vital energy."</p><p></p><p>"Oh? I didn't expect you to have such refined interests! Let this old man take a look at what little toys you've been raising down there."</p><p></p><p>Jiang Chen followed Ye Xiao with a faint smile.</p><p></p><p>But when he saw the star beasts down below, the smile on his face instantly turned to stone.</p><p></p><p>What did he see? A group of star beasts, the weakest of which were at the Shenzu level, and among them were even peak Innate Ninth-Grade and semi-divine beast-level star beasts.</p><p></p><p>Was this some kind of joke? If it were Innate Seventh-Grade star beasts that he was raising, Jiang Chen could still understand to some extent.</p><p></p><p>After all, Ye Xiao's strength was too monstrous, already reaching the King Realm! But Beitang Ce had also said that Ye Xiao had only broken through to the King Realm within the past month. Before that, he was only below the King Realm, even if he was at the peak of the Innate Ninth-Grade, half a step into the King Realm, he was still ultimately below the King Realm, not truly in the King Realm.</p><p></p><p>How did he manage to subdue so many high-level star beasts?</p><p></p><p>Especially that Shenzu Ninth-Grade peak and semi-divine beast-level powerhouses, they not only had formidable cultivation, but also the pride of being star beast experts!</p><p></p><p>As long as this pride existed, how could they willingly be kept by Ye Xiao?</p><p></p><p>Even some human scholars would rather die than submit, yet these mighty star beast experts had lost all face?</p><p></p><p>"Xuanwu senior, I'm going down to repair the formation."</p><p></p><p>Ye Xiao's voice snapped Jiang Chen out of his shock, and he quickly nodded.</p><p></p><p>"Oh, yes, go ahead."</p><p></p><p>Ye Xiao nodded and entered the spatial dimension to begin repairing the formation.</p><p></p><p>Jiang Chen could no longer continue observing the subsequent events.</p><p></p><p>He could only shake his head and sigh, chuckling self-deprecatingly.</p><p></p><p>"This is truly the later waves pushing the earlier waves! The earlier waves die on the beach. I'm old, no good anymore! Alas!"</p><p></p><p>With that, he clasped his hands behind his back, slightly hunched over, and walked into the library.</p><p></p><p>On Ye Xiao's side, he arrived at the breeding ground and repaired the formation, this time infusing it with enough spirit stones to fully unleash it to the Emperor Formation level.</p><p></p><p>In other words, from now on, unless there are Emperor Realm experts or super divine beast-level star beast experts, no one else would be able to break through this formation.</p><p></p><p>After completing all this, Ye Xiao entered the breeding ground spatial dimension, and the star beasts immediately came forward to greet him warmly.</p><p></p><p>"The master has come."</p><p></p><p>"Master, are you unharmed? The battle up there was so fierce, you weren't injured, were you?"</p><p></p><p>Ye Xiao nodded, his gaze falling on the heads of the Azure Ox and Sealed Dragon.</p><p></p><p>"What happened to your heads? Why are they so severely injured?"</p><p></p><p>The Azure Ox and Sealed Dragon coughed awkwardly, a bit embarrassed.</p><p></p><p>"Uh, it's nothing, we two just wanted to try sparring a bit, and ended up accidentally injuring each other. Just a minor injury, the master need not worry."</p><p></p><p>Ye Xiao didn't expose them.</p><p></p><p>With his keen eyesight, he could naturally see that the gashes on their heads were caused by Li Liushui's blade.</p><p></p><p>Probably just now, the two of them wanted to escape, but ended up being slashed by Li Liushui.</p><p></p><p>In taming star beasts, one must employ both kindness and strictness. They had already been cut, receiving a lesson, and there was no need for him to press them further.</p><p></p><p>With a casual healing art, Ye Xiao healed the two star beasts, then spoke:</p><p></p><p>"You all have done very well this time. As a reward, I'll let you rest for a week without having to offer blood and flesh. Additionally, I'll also reward you with a batch of spirit herbs to help improve your strength."</p><p></p><p>The eyes of the star beasts suddenly lit up.</p><p></p><p>Wow, not having to offer their own blood and flesh, and also getting rewarded with spirit herbs. </p><p></p><p>How awesome!</p><p></p><p>It's a good thing they didn't escape, otherwise they would have missed out on this.</p><p></p><p>Looking at the Azure Ox and Sealed Dragon, they went out but didn't escape, and instead got slashed by someone, suffering a useless injury.</p><p></p><p>After tossing a pile of top-grade spirit herbs, Ye Xiao left the breeding ground and set up a Heavenly Slaughter Formation throughout the Jianghai City.</p><p></p><p>This way, in the future, if Jianghai City encountered any...</p><p></p><p>Here is the full English translation of the Chinese excerpt:</p><p></p><p>If it's troublesome, activate the grand formation, and the citizens only need to hide in their own houses, then they don't need to worry about getting injured.</p><p></p><p>Moreover, the buildings won't be damaged. Ye Xiao also doesn't have to go through the trouble of casting healing spells every time.</p><p></p><p>His cultivation level is now very high, and the speed is very fast. Completing all this is just a matter of a few hours.</p><p></p><p>Afterward, he will return home to meditate and cultivate.</p><p></p><p>What Ye Xiao is most lacking now is enlightenment. If he can perfectly attain the final enlightenment, he will definitely be able to break through to the Emperor Realm expert.</p><p></p><p>He doesn't know where to start with this enlightenment.</p><p></p><p>When he broke through the King Realm, he learned some enlightenment from the Soldier Saint's stele.</p><p></p><p>But that was the King Realm, not the Emperor Realm.</p><p></p><p>The King Realm and the Emperor Realm have fundamental differences.</p><p></p><p>A King rules over a region, the land and its people are his subjects! An Emperor is the sovereign of the entire world, all under heaven is his territory.</p><p></p><p>No one can surpass him in the heavens and on earth.</p><p></p><p>So the enlightenment he gained in the King Realm is not suitable for his advancement to the Emperor Realm.</p><p></p><p>"If I can find an Emperor Realm expert, perhaps they can help me unravel the final mystery." On the surface of the earth, there are no more Emperor Realm experts. If he wants to find an Emperor Realm expert, there is only one place left.</p><p></p><p>Ye Xiao looked up at the starry sky.</p><p></p><p>The Star Battlefield!</p><p></p><p>Should he go to the Star Battlefield? With his current strength, as long as he doesn't encounter a Supernal Beast, there won't be too much danger.</p><p></p><p>To break through to the Emperor Realm, taking a slightly risky trip to the Star Battlefield is normal.</p><p></p><p>However, he has never been to the Star Battlefield before, and doesn't know the situation there. He's even more uncertain about the location of the human race's Emperor Realm experts.</p><p></p><p>Going there recklessly would be too abrupt.</p><p></p><p>It's better to wait until tomorrow when he goes to work, and ask the Pavilion Master to give him a route.</p><p></p><p>In the western region, the Great Canyon of the Americas, a mournful dragon's roar erupted into the sky.</p><p></p><p>Above the earth, a giant dragon's shadow emerged out of thin air.</p><p></p><p>It seemed to be struggling to escape from here, but before it could do so, a huge tiger figure leaped out from below, biting into the dragon's vital point, firmly pinning it down and dragging it to the ground.</p><p></p><p>"Roar! Roar! Roar!"</p><p></p><p>The dragon let out one roar after another, filled with unwillingness!</p><p></p><p>But in the end, it could not resist, and was finally subdued by the fierce tiger.</p><p></p><p>The dragon was absorbed into a storage ring, and the tiger transformed back into a human form - Zhen Xing Tiger.</p><p></p><p>"Clap, clap, clap."</p><p></p><p>A series of clapping sounds rang out as Blood Wing slowly emerged from the dark shadows, a look of excitement on his face.</p><p></p><p>"As expected of the renowned Zhen Xing Tiger, the 97th ranked expert on the Star Rank. A dragon vein was so easily captured by you. If it were me, I probably would have been beaten up."</p><p></p><p>Zhen Xing Tiger snorted coldly.</p><p></p><p>"Spare me your sarcasm. This is the 17th dragon vein I've collected. With so many dragon veins, shouldn't you be able to take me to the Nine States now?"</p><p></p><p>"Of course, with these dragon veins in hand, our trip to the Nine States will be absolutely safe. Let me utilize these dragon veins tonight to repair my injuries, and tomorrow we'll head straight for the Nine States."</p><p></p><p>"You better not try any tricks, or I'll twist your head off."</p><p></p><p>Zhen Xing Tiger snorted coldly, then jumped onto a cliff and began to meditate.</p><p></p><p>Blood Wing's mouth curled up slightly.</p><p></p><p>The reason he wanted to collect the dragon veins was to use them to refine his own body.</p><p></p><p>The Blood Clan is a semi-beast race, not a pure star beast, so their bodies contain a portion of human bloodline.</p><p></p><p>And within the human bloodline lies divine blood.</p><p></p><p>He wants to use these dragon veins to help activate and refine the divine blood within him.</p><p></p><p>In this way, his strength will increase greatly, and he may even have the chance to reach the Half-Step Supernal realm.</p><p></p><p>Once he reaches that realm, and goes to the Nine States to obtain the Long White Dragon Vein, fully activating the divine blood within him, becoming a Supernal Beast will be no problem.</p><p></p><p>Supernal Beasts are comparable to the human Emperor Realm experts, but in the human world, there are no Emperor Realm experts now.</p><p></p><p>It means that no one will be able to resist him.</p><p></p><p>At that time, he can take the initiative to collect the human race before the Calamity of Beasts descends, and extensively extract the divine blood from their fresh blood.</p><p></p><p>This will further consolidate his strength, and even if those Supernal Beasts descend into the human world, he won't need to worry at all.</p><p></p><p>This has been his goal and plan from the very beginning.</p><p></p><p>He wants to be the master of his own destiny, not a servant under other Supernal Star Beasts.</p><p></p><p>He wants to control a domain and stand on equal footing with them, becoming a supreme expert.</p><p></p><p>"All the humans in the world belong to me. The final victory will belong to me, Blood Wing."</p><p></p><p>This is the first update, 3,000 words.</p><p></p><p>Please vote for monthly tickets and recommendation tickets.</p><p></p><p>Thank you to the dear readers Aini Hao Ma, Yuan, Jidu Youyu, Moshang, and Shiyeye for your donations, I'm deeply grateful.</p><p></p><p>(This chapter is complete)</p>

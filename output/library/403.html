        <h1>Chapter 403</h1>
        <div class="content">
            <p>Here is the full English translation of the Chinese excerpt:</p><p></p><p>A powerful punch landed, the Fist of Shattering Stars combined with the Annihilation Treasure Art, directly hitting Cloud Water's chest, instantly piercing through his chest.</p><p></p><p>The overwhelming power instantly killed him.</p><p></p><p>However, in the next second, a golden light suddenly fled from the bottom of Cloud Water's feet.</p><p></p><p>That was Cloud Water's soul.</p><p></p><p>Beast Tamers have many unique methods, and when facing death, they can escape their souls.</p><p></p><p>They find their star pets and attach their souls to their star pets, and then revive.</p><p></p><p>The speed of the soul's escape was astonishingly fast, almost in an instant, it directly broke through the spatial blockade and arrived at the Cloud family's spiritual energy ship, merging into a star beast.</p><p></p><p>"Hurry! Activate the spiritual energy ship! Hurry and leave!"</p><p></p><p>Having just merged into the star beast, Cloud Water hurriedly rushed into the spiritual energy ship, controlling it to flee.</p><p></p><p>The spiritual energy ship's spiritual energy was fully unleashed, its massive body of over 200,000 meters was surprisingly agile.</p><p></p><p>It ascended into the sky in an instant.</p><p></p><p>The people of the Ning family couldn't help but fly out of the manor.</p><p></p><p>"What's going on? Why did the Cloud family's spiritual energy ship suddenly leave?"</p><p></p><p>"And it's so fast!"</p><p></p><p>But before they could react, in the next second, a golden light shot in from outside the Jianghai City, like a high-powered laser beam, shooting straight towards the spiritual energy ship.</p><p></p><p>Boom! It arrived at the spiritual energy ship, ruthlessly piercing through the spiritual energy ship, accompanied by a thunderous explosion, the 200,000-meter-level super-powerful spiritual energy ship was instantly split in half.</p><p></p><p>This terrifying scene shocked everyone present.</p><p></p><p>"My god! What's happening?"</p><p></p><p>"Quickly go up and take a look."</p><p></p><p>One powerful expert after another flew up into the sky.</p><p></p><p>In the sky above, seeing the spiritual energy ship being blasted open by Ye Xiao's punch, Cloud Water was extremely terrified, his pants soaked with urine.</p><p></p><p>He didn't hesitate at all, immediately activating the distress signal.</p><p></p><p>This was a special distress signal on the spiritual energy ship, and as soon as it was activated, the formation would be triggered, randomly allowing a powerful expert from the Cloud family to transmit their avatar over.</p><p></p><p>Although it was just an avatar, it could still exert about one-tenth the power of the original body.</p><p></p><p>The moment he pressed the button, a thunderous sound came from the sky, and a powerful, oppressive aura suddenly descended from the sky, not overwhelmingly strong, but extremely sharp and oppressive.</p><p></p><p>The Ning family members who were just about to fly up felt this sharp aura and couldn't help but tremble.</p><p></p><p>"This aura, it's him! It's Cloud XuanYuan! The Cloud family's young master, that peerless genius!"</p><p></p><p>The people couldn't help but exclaim, and Ye Xiao's fist once again approached Cloud Water.</p><p></p><p>Boom! Another violent explosion, and in the sky, a dazzling light like the sun suddenly burst out.</p><p></p><p>The entire 200,000-meter-level spiritual energy ship was completely reduced to ashes under this attack.</p><p></p><p>When the light faded, the crowd quickly looked up at the sky, and what they saw, apart from countless fragments of the spiritual energy ship, was a figure wearing a bamboo hat and cloak, holding the star beast that Cloud Water's soul had invaded.</p><p></p><p>"XuanYuan, save me!"</p><p></p><p>Under the starry sky, Cloud XuanYuan's avatar spoke:</p><p></p><p>"Do not harm our own kind!"</p><p></p><p>But Ye Xiao didn't even look up at him, unleashing the Annihilation Treasure Art.</p><p></p><p>Bang! With a violent explosion, the star beast that Cloud Water had invaded, along with his soul, was completely shattered into powder, leaving no trace.</p><p></p><p>The Ning family members who witnessed this were all shocked.</p><p></p><p>This guy is too arrogant! He actually slaughtered the Cloud family's elder right in front of Cloud Xuanyuan! Madman, this is a madman! Cloud Xuanyuan's avatar stared directly at Ye Xiao, then raised his hand and threw a punch.</p><p></p><p>"You've gone too far."</p><p></p><p>His avatar's strength was only at the Deicide Realm Second Layer, on par with Ye Xiao's current strength.</p><p></p><p>But the power of this punch was heaven-shaking and earth-shattering! Under this attack, even the stars in the sky flickered.</p><p></p><p>The terrifying aura made all the Ning family members' hearts race.</p><p></p><p>This was a treasure art! One of the two ancestral treasure arts of the XuanYuan Clan - the Righteous Treasure Art! The ancestors of the Xuanyuan Clan used this art to dominate the starry sky thousands of years ago, laying the foundation for the Xuanyuan Clan. Seeing him strike, Ye Xiao didn't hold back either, and also unleashed a punch.</p><p></p><p>The Fist of Shattering Stars, imbued with the Annihilation Treasure Art.</p><p></p><p>But this time, he unleashed the Annihilation Treasure Art to the extreme! The stars in the sky seemed to be shaken again and flickered.</p><p></p><p>The power of the two treasure arts colliding created a small sun in the sky.</p><p></p><p>This overwhelming power even caused the Myriad Miles River-Crossing Great Formation that had been protecting the Nine Realms to be unable to withstand it, and cracks began to appear.</p><p></p><p>Crack, crack, boom! Finally, with a violent explosion, a large hole was completely blown open.</p><p></p><p>Everyone present was shocked, this Myriad Miles River-Crossing Great Formation was at least able to defend against Deicide Realm attacks.</p><p></p><p>Yet it was directly blasted open by two Deicide Realm Second Layer existences! This is the power of the ancient treasure arts? It's too terrifying!</p><p></p><p>The two of them unleashing this attack...</p><p></p><p>Here is the full English translation of the Chinese excerpt:</p><p></p><p>The point of impact, the power had already far exceeded the limits that the Deicide Realm could withstand.</p><p></p><p>This level of power, even a Deicide Realm Sixth Stage expert would not be able to endure.</p><p></p><p>A battle across realms! A true battle across realms!</p><p></p><p>The powerful shockwaves directly transformed into a vast wind force, blowing the members of the Ning family off balance, causing them to retreat. At the same time, the avatar of Yun XuanYuan in the sky also wavered, becoming faint and indistinct.</p><p></p><p>In contrast, Ye Xiao stood firm, only his cloak fluttering in the wind.</p><p></p><p>Everyone present couldn't help but be shocked.</p><p></p><p>This strike, Yun Xuanyuan, had been suppressed.</p><p></p><p>This had greatly shaken their worldview.</p><p></p><p>After all, the one who had come was only Yun Xuanyuan's avatar, but the power he was able to display was that of a true Deicide Realm Second Stage.</p><p></p><p>This level of cultivation, was it not exactly the same as Ye Xiao's?</p><p></p><p>Yet, both being at the Deicide Realm Second Stage, both using the ancient divine arts, Yun Xuanyuan was still suppressed, which was truly thought-provoking.</p><p></p><p>The avatar of Yun Xuanyuan in the sky wavered a few times, but did not continue the attack. That previous move had exhausted all the power of this avatar.</p><p></p><p>If he were to launch a new attack, his avatar would be completely destroyed.</p><p></p><p>Before disappearing, he slowly spoke:</p><p></p><p>"Half a year from now, I will come in person to the Canglan Star Realm and fight you. Do you dare to accept?"</p><p></p><p>Ye Xiao looked at him and turned to leave.</p><p></p><p>"Wash your neck and wait."</p><p></p><p>The corners of everyone's mouths couldn't help but twitch violently.</p><p></p><p>Wash your neck and wait? Was he going to kill Yun Xuanyuan? This kid was truly too reckless! Even if he had defeated Yun Xuanyuan once, that did not mean he could defeat him next time.</p><p></p><p>Because this time, Yun Xuanyuan had only sent his avatar. His true body's strength was far superior, already reaching the Deicide Realm Ninth Stage.</p><p></p><p>While Ye Xiao was only at the Deicide Realm Second Stage. There was a difference of seven whole stages between them. How could he possibly make up that gap in half a year?</p><p></p><p>It's over! He's doomed! He had been so arrogant in front of Yun Xuanyuan today.</p><p></p><p>When the time came, he would undoubtedly die.</p><p></p><p>At this moment, the crowd wanted to go forward and persuade him, hoping he wouldn't be so impulsive.</p><p></p><p>After all, his talent was right there, his martial dao talent was so monstrous. They really didn't want him to perish at the hands of Yun Xuanyan.</p><p></p><p>If he could just be properly cultivated, his future would be limitless.</p><p></p><p>But it was a pity that before the crowd could approach, Ye Xiao's figure had already completely transformed into a beam of light, disappearing into the heavens and earth, his speed so fast it was mind-boggling.</p><p></p><p>The members of the Ning family hadn't even had time to see which direction he had gone, and he had already vanished.</p><p></p><p>The corners of their mouths twitched violently.</p><p></p><p>"This kid didn't even consider us at all!"</p><p></p><p>The Yun Xuanyan in the sky looked meaningfully at the direction Ye Xiao had disappeared, then his figure flickered and also vanished.</p><p></p><p>In the blink of an eye, only the spectating Ning family remained in the sky, while the two who had truly fought had both left.</p><p></p><p>Well, not only did Ye Xiao not consider them at all, even Yun Xuanyan didn't consider them at all.</p><p></p><p>Being looked down upon, no, directly ignored by these two juniors!</p><p></p><p>A night wind blew by, and Ning Second Uncle sighed:</p><p></p><p>"Should we go down now?"</p><p></p><p>The crowd remained silent, but their bodies were honest, one by one beginning to descend.</p><p></p><p>Today's events had truly shocked them too much.</p><p></p><p>Whether it was Ye Xiao's talent, Yun Xuanyan's avatar, or the duel between the two, they were all far beyond what they had imagined.</p><p></p><p>What made them even more helpless was that in the face of this duel between the two Xuanyan Clan geniuses, they hadn't even been able to insert a single word, watching them leave with their own eyes.</p><p></p><p>It was as if they were just spectators, completely unqualified to participate.</p><p></p><p>Aside from shock, the crowd also felt a deep sense of loss.</p><p></p><p>Facing such prodigies, everyone had a feeling of being abandoned by the times! They were too far ahead, as if they were at the forefront of the entire era.</p><p></p><p>It could be foreseen that if, half a year from now, the two of them were still fine, their future would undoubtedly leave a deep mark under the starry sky.</p><p></p><p>They would definitely become the legendary Shen Emperor experts! And they, would be the witnesses!</p><p></p><p>Thinking of this, the crowd's mood seemed to improve a little.</p>

        <h1>Chapter 172</h1>
        <div class="content">
            <p>Here is the full English translation of the Chinese excerpt:</p><p></p><p>After Ye Xiao left, the spiritual energy absorption in the entire Jianghai City began to expand rapidly.</p><p></p><p>This drastic change soon caught the attention of people like Du Changfeng, who quickly came to the library and stood in front of the statue of the Sword Immortal.</p><p></p><p>"What's going on? The speed at which this city is absorbing spiritual energy has suddenly increased significantly!"</p><p></p><p>"I'm not sure, there must have been some changes in the spirit gathering formation. Unfortunately, the seal of Senior Sword Immortal is too powerful, at the imperial formation level, so I cannot see the situation in the spirit gathering formation below."</p><p></p><p>Du Changfeng was silent for a moment.</p><p></p><p>"Could this be related to Senior Sword Immortal as well?"</p><p></p><p>Fa Zheng shook his head.</p><p></p><p>"I can't say for sure, but it is very likely related to him. </p><p></p><p>City Lord, you don't need to worry, because I can feel that the speed at which Jianghai City is gathering spiritual energy is now no less than those first-tier cities. This is a tremendous benefit for the city!"</p><p></p><p>Du Changfeng was stunned, then overjoyed.</p><p></p><p>Jianghai City's previous strength could only be considered a small third-tier city. </p><p></p><p>Later, with the cultivation and support of the Nine州Alliance and the Central州, it was now progressing towards becoming a second-tier city.</p><p></p><p>And now, it actually has the speed of a first-tier city in gathering spiritual energy - this is an immeasurable benefit for the development of Jianghai City!</p><p></p><p>Two days later, on the border between Central州and Chu州, in a vast mountain range, there was a deep pit, comparable in scale to a great abyss, as if it had been created by a meteorite striking the ground.</p><p></p><p>But upon closer inspection, the rock walls of this pit were covered in sword marks, some over hundreds of meters long, exuding a chilling, bone-piercing aura. </p><p></p><p>Anyone who saw it would be filled with a sense of terrifying fear deep in their heart.</p><p></p><p>This was the site of the former Beastly God Sect!</p><p></p><p>The Beastly God Sect had once coiled around this place, causing headaches for several cities in Central州and Chu州.</p><p></p><p>But now, apart from this deep pit, nothing of the Beastly God Sect remained. There were even a few piles of beast droppings at the bottom of the pit.</p><p></p><p>Yet at this moment, several figures flew down into this deep pit.</p><p></p><p>"So this is one of the branch sects of our Beastly God Alliance, the ruins of the Beastly God Sect? The humans have done a thorough job."</p><p></p><p>These words were spoken with a cold glint and murderous intent in the eyes of the others.</p><p></p><p>"The Beastly God Sect was the 250th branch sect of our Beastly God Alliance. Although the overall strength of the Beastly God Sect was not particularly outstanding within our alliance, they had been providing resources to the Beastly God Alliance without interruption for years. </p><p></p><p>If we do not avenge the Beastly God Sect, won't the other sects in our alliance be disheartened? Go and investigate, find out who destroyed the Beastly God Sect, and I will kill their family, exterminate their clan, and destroy their city!"</p><p></p><p>"Left Protector, our investigation has found that the most likely culprit is the Sword Immortal from Jiangcheng in Central州."</p><p></p><p>"The Sword Immortal? Who is that?"</p><p></p><p>"According to our information, the identity of the Sword Immortal is very mysterious, and no one knows who he is so far. Only that his cultivation is very strong."</p><p></p><p>The one called the Left Protector sneered contemptuously.</p><p></p><p>"How strong?"</p><p></p><p>"He is a Saint Emperor. And if there are no unexpected circumstances, he should be an early-stage Saint Emperor of the eighth level!"</p><p></p><p>The Left Protector's face suddenly changed drastically, and he raised his voice.</p><p></p><p>"How much?"</p><p></p><p>"An early-stage eighth-level Saint Emperor."</p><p></p><p>The others repeated it again.</p><p></p><p>The Left Protector's face darkened as he asked, "How did you determine that he is an early-stage eighth-level Saint Emperor?"</p><p></p><p>"According to our information, a few days ago he defeated the 50th and 49th ranked experts on the World Dragon Rankings, Village Akira and Liu Chengxun, with a single strike. And those two had just recently broken through to the eighth level of Saint Emperor."</p><p></p><p>The Left Protector's face twitched uncontrollably.</p><p></p><p>His subordinate carefully looked at him and timidly asked, "Left Protector, should we still avenge the Beastly God Sect?"</p><p></p><p>However, before he could finish speaking, the Left Protector raised his hand and blasted him into a mist of blood.</p><p></p><p>"You idiot. The Beastly God Sect violated the rules of our alliance by provoking the humans, and was killed by them. I have already pardoned them, almost implicating our Beastly God Alliance, and you still want me to avenge the Beastly God Sect? </p><p></p><p>You are truly a fool without any foresight."</p><p></p><p>The other subordinates were terrified, almost wetting their pants, but none of them dared to resist, for the Left Protector was an early-stage seventh-level Saint Emperor.</p><p></p><p>After blasting away that subordinate, the Left Protector continued, "There is one more thing I want to tell you. In the cities of the human realm, each one has a spirit gathering formation, with a powerful spirit beast as the formation's core. </p><p></p><p>I want you to find a city that has a Saint Emperor-level spirit beast, a complete Saint Emperor spirit beast, so that I can absorb it and complete my bloodline transformation, fully advancing my cultivation to the eighth level of Saint Emperor!"</p><p></p><p>"Left Protector, there are several such cities around here..."</p><p></p><p>Here is the full English translation of the Chinese excerpt:</p><p></p><p>"Every city has a Deity-Patriarch-level star beast."</p><p></p><p>"Of course I know that, but the Deity-Patriarch-level star beasts in these cities are all divided parts of a complete Deity-Patriarch star beast, and their strength has been weakened to the level of a Grand Master. </p><p></p><p>Basically, it takes the collection of parts from several cities to gather the complete body of a Deity-Patriarch star beast. If I try to find them one by one, it's easy for the human race to discover, and that would ruin my grand plan.</p><p></p><p>What I'm looking for is a Deity-Patriarch star beast that exists independently. </p><p></p><p>That way I can complete the transformation in one go.</p><p></p><p>Once I break through to the Eighth Rank of the Innate Realm, I will no longer fear the human race!"</p><p></p><p>"Excellent insight, Protector. We'll go find it right away."</p><p></p><p>"Remember, try to find the newly emerging small cities as much as possible, and absolutely do not go to the big cities. The big cities are swarming with experts, and you'll run into a lot of trouble there."</p><p></p><p>"Understood."</p><p></p><p>On the other side, in the Grand Hotel of Jianghai City.</p><p></p><p>Piao Jiansheng knelt before his master, his face extremely solemn.</p><p></p><p>"Have you really decided?"</p><p></p><p>"Disciple has decided to join the Nine States and leave the Han State."</p><p></p><p>Liu Chengxun looked at his beloved disciple, his gaze somewhat complex.</p><p></p><p>More than twenty years ago, he had found this child at the border between the Nine States and the Han State, attracted by the fact that he had seven-eighths of the Central State bloodline.</p><p></p><p>Although the people of the Han State also originated from the Nine States lineage, they were all descendants of the Nine States ancestors who had migrated to the Han State. But for some reason, the bloodline of the Han State people was far inferior to that of the Nine States.</p><p></p><p>Moreover, as time passed, the power of the Han State people's bloodline kept steadily declining.</p><p></p><p>Perhaps this is the case of "an orange tree growing in the south becomes an orange, while one growing in the north becomes a trifoliate orange"? Perhaps the Han State, this wretched place, is far inferior to the Nine States in terms of auspicious land and talents, so it can't produce any geniuses, and what it produces is basically trash.</p><p></p><p>It was for this reason that Liu Chengxun had exceptionally accepted Piao Jiansheng as his disciple.</p><p></p><p>The facts proved that Piao Jiansheng had not disappointed him.</p><p></p><p>In the shortest time, he had mastered a lot of the Sword Dao, and had even defeated many sword dao geniuses from the Jing State.</p><p></p><p>But unexpectedly, in the end, Piao Jiansheng still chose to return to the Nine States.</p><p></p><p>All his efforts had been in vain.</p><p></p><p>Oh well, everything in this world is predestined, and it's not something that can be changed just by one's own will.</p><p></p><p>"Alright, as you said, you go to the Jiangzhou City Lord's Mansion and submit the identity transfer registration form, and let them handle it for you.</p><p></p><p>As for the Han State, you don't need to worry, they still dare not defy your master's words."</p><p></p><p>Piao Jiansheng's gaze held both guilt and gratitude.</p><p></p><p>"Thank you, Master, for granting this. Master, rest assured, although I have changed my identity back and become a Nine States person again, you will always be my master, and this will never change."</p><p></p><p>Liu Chengxun nodded with satisfaction, knowing that Piao Jiansheng was a good child, kind-hearted, and had not been tainted by the filthy aspects of the Han State.</p><p></p><p>"Oh yes, Master, when are you going back to the Han State? I'll see you off."</p><p></p><p>"There's no need for that, I'm not leaving."</p><p></p><p>Piao Jiansheng had a puzzled expression on his face.</p><p></p><p>"Master is not leaving? Aren't you going back to the Han State?"</p><p></p><p>Liu Chengxun nodded.</p><p></p><p>"That's right, I'm going to cultivate in seclusion in Jianghai City for a while. And also to take a look at that Sword-Dao Immortal, just what kind of person is he? His sword techniques are very powerful, they have won my admiration, which is the first time in my life that I've wanted to worship someone.</p><p></p><p>If I can't see him in person, I'm afraid my state of mind may never break through in this lifetime."</p><p></p><p>Piao Jiansheng was shocked, the Sword-Dao Immortal's influence on his master had reached such a level?</p><p></p><p>The mighty Eighth Rank of the Innate Realm super expert, actually had his state of mind shaken by the other party's single sword strike.</p><p></p><p>But thinking about it, the Sword-Dao Immortal's strength was truly monstrous and extraordinary, so he had the qualifications to shake his master's state of mind.</p><p></p><p>"But won't they not allow Master to stay in the Nine States for too long?</p><p></p><p>After all, Master's cultivation is so strong, the Nine States Alliance will probably also be vigilant of Master, to prevent Master from harming the people of the Nine States."</p><p></p><p>"That's not a problem, as long as Master follows their requirements."</p><p></p><p>"What requirements?"</p><p></p><p>"Find a classroom, preferably one with surveillance cameras, and be able to contact them and be under their monitoring for a certain amount of time every day."</p><p></p><p>Piao Jiansheng's face couldn't help but twitch violently.</p><p></p><p>The mighty Han State Sword Saint Liu Chengxun had actually become a crazy fan, willing to be shackled and obediently stay in Jianghai City just to pursue the Sword-Dao Immortal? Sword-Dao Immortal, your charm is truly boundless!</p><p></p><p>"Master, are you really willing to be constrained by the Nine States Alliance just to pursue the Sword-Dao Immortal? You are a mighty Eighth Rank of the Innate Realm Deity-Patriarch!"</p><p></p><p>"Actually, there's another long-hidden secret that I've never told you."</p>

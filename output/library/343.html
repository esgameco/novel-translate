        <div class="content">
            <p>Here is the full English translation of the Chinese excerpt:</p><p></p><p>After I came to this world, the first thing I did was conduct an investigation. </p><p></p><p>After repeated confirmations, I can now say with 100% certainty that the ancestral homeland of Patriarch Dragon is right here.</p><p></p><p>If my prediction is correct, once the other factions find out about this, they will definitely increase their investment in this place.</p><p></p><p>Since the Xuanyuan branch was able to produce a Patriarch Dragon, it's possible that it could also produce a second Patriarch Dragon.</p><p></p><p>And the person I'm most optimistic about right now is this Sword Immortal.</p><p></p><p>I can't guarantee that he will definitely become as powerful as Patriarch Dragon, after all Patriarch Dragon is the most brilliant talent to have appeared in the starry sky in tens of thousands of years.</p><p></p><p>Not only him, even among the entire Xuanyuan Clan, with all their geniuses, there is no one who can guarantee becoming as powerful as Patriarch Dragon.</p><p></p><p>But even if he can't become as strong as Patriarch Dragon, relying on the fact that he and Patriarch Dragon share the same bloodline, combined with his excellent innate talents, he can still break through to surpass our existence just relying on this desolate world.</p><p></p><p>I dare to assert that his future accomplishments will definitely not be low.</p><p></p><p>As long as we find him and do our utmost to cultivate him, even if we only manage to cultivate a Godking, it would still be a huge windfall for the Shenmu Academy.</p><p></p><p>The Shenmu Academy is currently a relatively low-tier force within the Xuanyuan Clan. Our cultivation methods are not good enough, we can at most access around 5-star divine arts.</p><p></p><p>If we produce a Godking-level expert, we would definitely be able to apply for 9-star divine arts from the Xuanyuan Alliance.</p><p></p><p>And since he shares the same origins as Patriarch Dragon, he may even be able to apply for the legendary precious arts that the Xuanyuan Clan regards as their clan treasure!</p><p></p><p>Yao Meiqin's heart started to beat violently.</p><p></p><p>For her, she had never dared to even dream of 9-star imperial arts, let alone the legendary ancient precious arts that the Xuanyuan Clan regarded as their clan treasure.</p><p></p><p>The ancient precious arts were something that only the top-tier races throughout the starry sky history had. The divine art she was currently cultivating was only a 1-star one, and she already treasured it greatly.</p><p></p><p>Her breathing became a little rapid again, her chest rising and falling more violently.</p><p></p><p>"We must find this Sword Immortal, no matter what it takes."</p><p></p><p>"Correct."</p><p></p><p>"But what about this Winged Clan member?"</p><p></p><p>"We'll keep him hidden for now. If we expose him right now, it would be equivalent to exposing the Sword Immortal as well.</p><p></p><p>That would be an extremely unprofitable deal for us.</p><p></p><p>At least we need to be given some time first, to go and search for the Sword Immortal."</p><p></p><p>A smile appeared on Yao Meiqin's face.</p><p></p><p>"Good! As long as we know he's in Jianghai City, that's enough. At least we have a higher chance of success than the others."</p><p></p><p>Xu Guangnian also smiled.</p><p></p><p>"The closest water gets the moon first, after all."</p><p></p><p>Meanwhile, in the West, in a newly rebuilt skyscraper, several figures were furious to the extreme.</p><p></p><p>"Damn the Xuanyuan Clan, they actually killed Hanks! They really don't give a damn about us at all."</p><p></p><p>"Let's go to war, everyone. The Xuanyuan Clan has gone too far! First they didn't give us face and refused to return the divine blood, and now they've even struck down one of our clan members. </p><p></p><p>This is no longer just slapping our face, this is them pissing on our necks."</p><p></p><p>At this moment, a burly man wrapped in iron chains spoke coldly, "You all need to think carefully. The Xuanyuan Clan is ranked 19th in the starry sky.</p><p></p><p>If we rashly start a fight, we may end up bringing great trouble to the clans behind us.</p><p></p><p>Most importantly, on what grounds can we attack them now? We told the Xuanyuan Clan to return the divine blood within a time limit, but we didn't say they had to return it immediately.</p><p></p><p>Now the Xuanyuan Clan hasn't even responded yet, and we're just going to attack them directly. In the future, this may lead to an all-out war between us and the Xuanyuan Clan, and that would be a huge disaster."</p><p></p><p>"But I just can't swallow this anger, the one who was killed was our Empyrean Realm expert from the Winged Clan!</p><p></p><p>The one who died wasn't your people, so you're all here talking nonsense."</p><p></p><p>"Now, now, don't say it like that! We three clans are now allied as one. Here's what, I can use the secret techniques of the Thunder God Clan to help you, to kill the one who slaughtered your Winged Clan Empyrean expert, in a way that no one will know. This way, I can at least avenge you first.</p><p></p><p>How about it?"</p><p></p><p>Hearing this, the expressions of the Winged Clan members eased up a little.</p><p></p><p>"If you had said this earlier, we wouldn't have gotten so angry. Go ahead and make your move, I want to kill him right now."</p><p></p><p>"Don't be hasty, it's broad daylight now. If we make our move in broad daylight and get discovered by the people around him, what then? Let's wait until tonight when they're asleep, and then we'll strike, killing him without anyone knowing."</p><p></p><p>"Alright, we'll do it tonight then!"</p><p></p><p>"At that time, I'll need you all to join me and provide Winged Clan divine blood, and also supply enough spiritual energy to help me cast the Thunder God Clan's secret technique."</p><p></p><p>"No problem, we'll give you as much as you need."</p><p></p><p>On Ye Xiao's side, he didn't think much about it.</p><p></p><p>He knew that the people from the Shenmu Academy would definitely guess part of it.</p><p></p><p>But the Martial Arts Library is not using surveillance cameras now, but rather some monitoring stones that can detect fluctuations in spiritual power and spiritual energy.</p><p></p><p>Here is the full English translation of the Chinese excerpt:</p><p></p><p>Rashly using other means would only make it easier for them to discover. </p><p></p><p>Extinguishing the opponent with my own ocular techniques can be done without anyone knowing! After all, everyone knows from the beginning that there is a sword immortal in Jianghai City.</p><p></p><p>In the end, it's all the fault of this damned Winged God Clan. You say you were just idling around, so why did you go to the library in Jianghai City? You went to the library, and that's fine, but why did you have to go up to the fourth floor for no reason?</p><p></p><p>You went to the fourth floor, saw me, and then why did you have to act? You say if you didn't act, you could have just turned around and run, and maybe I would have let you go if I was in a good mood.</p><p></p><p>Could it be because I killed Lin Qingbei and obtained those divine bloods, so a special fate was formed?</p><p></p><p>The theory of causality? It shouldn't be that serious, if such a thing really existed, I wouldn't know how many enemies I would provoke now.</p><p></p><p>I should find a way to cultivate well, strive to enter the divine realm as soon as possible, and then continue to refine divine techniques, creating ancient precious techniques.</p><p></p><p>When I returned home at night, Huan Liuli had already prepared a sumptuous dinner.</p><p></p><p>It was all made from the flesh and blood of those super divine beasts. Since there are so many of them, I can now perfectly assemble a large table of sumptuous banquets.</p><p></p><p>The super divine beasts must have resisted at first, but as my strength gradually increased, they gradually got used to it.</p><p></p><p>The main reason is that if they don't get used to it, it hurts too much when beaten.</p><p></p><p>It's also uncomfortable to have it forcibly cut off by me.</p><p></p><p>Whether I cut it myself or they cut it themselves, it's the same.</p><p></p><p>Although cutting it myself may not look as good on my face.</p><p></p><p>But at least I can eat celestial treasures.</p><p></p><p>In this regard, I am quite generous.</p><p></p><p>On the one hand, they are afraid of being beaten, and on the other hand, I give them a lot.</p><p></p><p>The carrot and stick policy, plus my healing techniques, makes it impossible for them to die, even if they want to resist.</p><p></p><p>Huan Liuli's cultivation has already reached the King Realm, and by eating so much with me every day, even a pig would have improved its cultivation.</p><p></p><p>"Master, how is the food I made today?"</p><p></p><p>Ye Xiao nodded.</p><p></p><p>"Today's is not bad. Why did you suddenly bring this up?"</p><p></p><p>"Oh, nothing, I just saw something in a shop recently that I want to buy.</p><p></p><p>After all, Master said we can't just steal from ordinary people."</p><p></p><p>Ye Xiao nodded.</p><p></p><p>"You've really grown up."</p><p></p><p>Huan Liuli twisted a bit, and with her swaying, the mountains and peaks rose and fell.</p><p></p><p>"It's all thanks to Master's good guidance."</p><p></p><p>Ye Xiao wiped his mouth with a napkin, took a sip of honey tea, and spoke again:</p><p></p><p>"What do you want to buy?"</p><p></p><p>Huan Liuli's face lit up excitedly:</p><p></p><p>"I want to buy a DVD. It's a TV series I've been wanting to find for a long time, that martial arts drama."</p><p></p><p>"The one with the handsome factory manager you mentioned?"</p><p></p><p>Huan Liuri's little head nodded like a rattle.</p><p></p><p>"Yes, yes, that's the one. I can't believe Master still remembers. Master is so good to me."</p><p></p><p>Ye Xiao: "(_..)!"</p><p></p><p>He really didn't expect that when the divine race had not yet descended and the whole world was still mainly using technological means, Huan Liuli couldn't find the resources for that martial arts drama, but now she actually found it.</p><p></p><p>If she sees the factory manager in it, what kind of being is that?</p><p></p><p>Won't she become so self-abased that she wants to commit suicide?</p><p></p><p>After a pause, he looked at Huan Liuli's excited little face and said:</p><p></p><p>"Liuli, you must learn to restrain your desires."</p><p></p><p>"But I'm just a cat."</p><p></p><p>Ye Xiao: "(#-_-)\!"</p><p></p><p>Okay, he had nothing else to say.</p><p></p><p>He took out some spirit stones from his storage ring.</p><p></p><p>Money is no longer usable now, and everyone uses spirit stones for transactions.</p><p></p><p>"Before I give it to you, I advise you not to go buy it."</p><p></p><p>Huan Liuli: "?!"</p><p></p><p>"Master, why are you speaking so strangely today?"</p><p></p><p>"Nothing, just know that I'm doing it for your own good."</p><p></p><p>"It's fine, I'm just going to watch a martial arts drama, not play a game, I won't get addicted. I'll go buy it first before someone else takes it. These technological products are already very hard to find, and there are people collecting them everywhere."</p><p></p><p>With that, Huan Liuli dashed out in a flash.</p><p></p><p>Ye Xiao shook his head.</p><p></p><p>Well, let her go.</p><p></p><p>I originally didn't want her to know, but since she insists on going to watch it, then let her go.</p><p></p><p>At this time, the moon in the east had begun to rise.</p><p></p><p>Inside the western high-rise, several powerful experts from three clans gathered, arranging a huge and mysterious formation on the ground.</p><p></p><p>Inscribed on it were strange symbols, and the Thunder God Clan expert wrapped in chains sat in the center, chanting the incantation of the formation.</p><p></p><p>The experts from the other two clans used spiritual energy to activate the formation.</p><p></p><p>Their eyes flashed with cold light as they glanced at each other, their mouths curling up, as if they were about to accomplish a great feat.</p>

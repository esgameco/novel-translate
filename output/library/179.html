        <h1>Chapter 179</h1>
        <div class="content">
            <p>Here is the full English translation of the Chinese excerpt:</p><p></p><p>Without any unnecessary words, it raised the steel knife in its hand and directly struck down towards the mother's head.</p><p></p><p>The mother and daughter were instantly plunged into utter despair, embracing each other, eyes tightly shut, not daring to look at the other's hideous countenance.</p><p></p><p>"Who, who can come and save us?"</p><p></p><p>Just as their wish had just formed, the next moment, a violent explosion suddenly rang out beside their ears.</p><p></p><p>Boom! This was followed by the sound of the steel knife falling to the ground.</p><p></p><p>The mother and daughter, filled with puzzlement, slowly opened their eyes, only to see that the half-beast's body had somehow exploded into a bloody mist.</p><p></p><p>The mother and daughter were completely bewildered, and in the next second, a brilliant light began to bloom in the sky above.</p><p></p><p>This light was filled with holiness, like divine radiance, and all the villagers illuminated by it began to revive.</p><p></p><p>In the blink of an eye, the entire mountain village was restored to its original state, as if the previous experience had just been a dream.</p><p></p><p>But on the ground, the steel knives dropped by the half-beasts and some fresh bloodstains testified that what had just happened was not a dream.</p><p></p><p>"A miracle! This is truly a miracle!"</p><p></p><p>"It must be that the Heavenly Father heard our cries and came to save us."</p><p></p><p>But the one who saved them was not the Heavenly Father, it was Ye Xiao's Supplementing the Heavens technique.</p><p></p><p>However, at this moment, Ye Xiao had already left the village.</p><p></p><p>He was not worried about having killed all the half-beasts.</p><p></p><p>Because before killing them, the Profound Heaven Astral had already directly read their memories.</p><p></p><p>Originally, Ye Xiao knew that the Beast God Alliance would definitely not be easy to find, so he didn't want to waste effort looking for them, and instead waited for the Beast God Alliance to come to him in Jianghai City, and then annihilate them.</p><p></p><p>But now that he had encountered them, there was no need to wait any longer.</p><p></p><p>The best way to solve the trouble is to nip it in the bud.</p><p></p><p>Moreover, Ye Xiao really didn't want these filthy fellows to continue living in this world.</p><p></p><p>Nanshan City was the largest city in the surrounding area and the city to which the small mountain village belonged.</p><p></p><p>At this time, although it was already deep night, the phone in the City Lord's Mansion suddenly rang.</p><p></p><p>"Hello!"</p><p></p><p>"City Lord Wang, ten minutes ago, a small mountain village was attacked by half-beasts."</p><p></p><p>"What's the situation? How are the villagers?"</p><p></p><p>"The specific situation is unknown, the half-beasts seem to have planned it, cutting off their telephone lines and also preventing signal jammers, making the small mountain village unable to call for help from the outside world.</p><p></p><p>But fortunately, they were revived, and all the star beasts were killed.</p><p></p><p>Preliminary judgment is that a powerful person passing by must have saved everyone."</p><p></p><p>A dark shadow suddenly flashed across the City Lord's eyes, disappearing in an instant.</p><p></p><p>"It's good that the people are safe. Immediately dispatch the garrison troops to go take a look, and also send some healing mages from the hospital to see if there are any injured villagers."</p><p></p><p>"Yes."</p><p></p><p>After hanging up the phone, his face instantly turned icy cold, and in the darkness, his eyes even had a faint reddish glow flickering, like a vengeful ghost.</p><p></p><p>"Damn it, who ruined my good plans?"</p><p></p><p>As soon as the words left his mouth, a strange voice suddenly sounded in his ear.</p><p></p><p>"As the lord of a city, colluding with half-beasts and harming your own people, doesn't your conscience hurt?"</p><p></p><p>"Who are you?" </p><p></p><p>The City Lord coldly spat out two words, instantly mobilizing all his spiritual energy, his body crouching like a vigilant cat, ready to pounce on its prey at any moment.</p><p></p><p>At the same time, he pulled out a metal dagger from beside the bed.</p><p></p><p>After a moment, a young figure emerged from the darkness, and in the moonlight, the City Lord could see the other's face clearly.</p><p></p><p>A very handsome young man.</p><p></p><p>But he dared not relax in the slightest because of the other's appearance.</p><p></p><p>The fact that the other could avoid all the garrison troops and come to his room meant that the other's strength was definitely not ordinary.</p><p></p><p>"Sir, who are you and what do you want from me?"</p><p></p><p>The visitor was none other than Ye Xiao.</p><p></p><p>"Why I'm here, you should know better than anyone."</p><p></p><p>"I don't..." </p><p></p><p>As the other tried to make excuses, Ye Xiao's mind moved, and his fingers suddenly snapped.</p><p></p><p>"Ahâ€”!"</p><p></p><p>The excruciating pain made him let out a miserable scream, his agonized expression twisting, and the dagger in his hand falling helplessly to the ground.</p><p></p><p>"What is your relationship with that small mountain village?"</p><p></p><p>He couldn't help but roar, but Ye Xiao didn't bother to respond, directly using the Profound Heaven Astral to invade his consciousness.</p><p></p><p>His cultivation was only at the level of a post-Heavenly Ninth Grade, not even reaching the Patriarch realm, and was completely unable to resist Ye Xiao's spiritual power.</p><p></p><p>Feeling his consciousness being taken over by Ye Xiao's spiritual power, his gaze suddenly became filled with terror.</p><p></p><p>It turned out that this was not just a martial arts expert, but also a spiritual power expert.</p><p></p><p>His methods were far beyond what he had imagined.</p><p></p><p>Damn it, he had run into an iron plate.</p><p></p><p>As for Ye Xiao, after scanning his memories, his face became even colder.</p><p></p><p>It turned out that this City Lord had poor innate talent, but was unwilling to just be an ordinary person, so he had secretly made a deal with the Beast God Alliance to help him advance to the Xiantian realm.</p><p></p><p>He did things for the Beast God Alliance, and the Beast God Alliance provided him with resources to help him improve his cultivation.</p><p></p><p>Here is the full English translation of the Chinese excerpt:</p><p></p><p>The small mountain village was not the first one, and this was not the first time he had done such a thing.</p><p></p><p>Sensing Ye Xiao's murderous intent spreading, he became frightened and hurriedly said:</p><p></p><p>"Senior, your junior knows he was wrong. Your junior was just momentarily confused and made a deal with the Beast God Alliance. Your junior will never make any deals with them again.</p><p></p><p>Moreover, your junior also has some elixirs and precious materials that he is willing to offer to the senior, hoping the senior can be magnanimous and spare your junior."</p><p></p><p>Ye Xiao's face was ice-cold as he said, "I spare you, but have you ever spared those people you betrayed?"</p><p></p><p>"Senior, I..."</p><p></p><p>This time, Ye Xiao did not let him finish speaking, but directly used the Taixuan Tiangong to shatter his spiritual power.</p><p></p><p>Ye Xiao had already found the location of the Beast God Alliance in his memory, so he no longer needed him alive.</p><p></p><p>However, Ye Xiao did not completely shatter his soul force into powder, but only shattered it into fragments.</p><p></p><p>In this way, when his superiors send spiritual cultivators to investigate, they will be able to clearly know about his dirty deeds.</p><p></p><p>However, Ye Xiao also completely deleted his memories related to himself.</p><p></p><p>Those spiritual cultivators will not be able to find a trace of him.</p><p></p><p>After doing all this, Ye Xiao took the opponent's storage ring and turned to leave.</p><p></p><p>The moonlight had not yet set, and he had already arrived in the west. At this time, it was approaching the darkest moment before dawn.</p><p></p><p>Ye Xiao used the Shenyi Jue to come to a river outside the Southern Mountain City.</p><p></p><p>With a thought, he unleashed the Earth Traversal Technique, and his body directly sank into the ground.</p><p></p><p>Deep underground, there was a huge lava cave. It was gloomy and damp, with dense phosphorescent fire illuminating the entire cave.</p><p></p><p>In the dim phosphorescent light, one could vaguely see that the ground was covered with countless white bones.</p><p></p><p>These white bones belonged to both star beasts and human tribes.</p><p></p><p>When Ye Xiao arrived in this lava cave, although he had already anticipated the scene, the sight still evoked a surge of anger in his eyes.</p><p></p><p>However, as soon as he appeared, eerie laughter began to echo from the cave.</p><p></p><p>"Hahaha, it's a human. I can smell the fragrance of a human."</p><p></p><p>"It really is a human! Unexpectedly, there is a human who dares to come here, and he is mine now."</p><p></p><p>"He is mine!"</p><p></p><p>Two shrill voices screamed, competing with each other, and quickly approached Ye Xiao.</p><p></p><p>Ye Xiao remained motionless, and a flash of a blade swept by, causing the two half-beast men who were about to completely transform into star beasts to have their heads fly off.</p><p></p><p>Afterwards, Ye Xiao continued to walk deeper into the cave.</p><p></p><p>In the depths of the cave, a woman in her thirties was lying on a cold jade bed, enjoying a man in his forties massaging her calves.</p><p></p><p>A subordinate by the side handed her a bowl of warm fresh blood.</p><p></p><p>"Sect Leader, this is the freshest."</p><p></p><p>The woman took the fresh blood, took a sip, and her eyes flashed with a red glow. Her originally thirty-something-year-old appearance became a few years younger, her skin crystal-clear and translucent, like beautiful jade, even better than that of a twenty-year-old girl.</p><p></p><p>"Left Guardian, why has he been gone for so long investigating the affairs of the Beast God Sect? Hasn't he come back yet?"</p><p></p><p>The middle-aged man who was massaging her immediately replied, "Sect Leader, Guardian Lang is about to break through. He wants to find a primordial seventh-grade divine beast star to help him break through.</p><p></p><p>It may take some time, as primordial seventh-grade divine beast stars are not easy to find."</p><p></p><p>The Sect Leader snorted lightly.</p><p></p><p>"He's thinking well, but after breaking through to the primordial eighth grade, he can stand on equal footing with me and no longer have to listen to my orders.</p><p></p><p>You men are all greedy and never know when to be content."</p><p></p><p>The middle-aged man immediately bowed his head and said, "Sect Leader, rest assured that your subordinate is absolutely loyal to you and will never be like Guardian Lang, always wanting to break through and stand on equal footing with you."</p><p></p><p>"Good." </p><p></p><p>The Sect Leader pulled his ear.</p><p></p><p>"Right Guardian is more obedient. Tonight, the Sect Leader will treat you well."</p><p></p><p>"Thank you, Sect Leader."</p><p></p><p>As soon as the words fell, there was a violent explosion, and the main entrance of the lava cave was directly blasted into pieces. Tumbling rocks mixed with the bodies of several half-beast men rolled in.</p><p></p><p>This caused the two people inside to suddenly turn cold.</p><p></p><p>"Who dares? How dare they!"</p><p></p><p>As the words fell, Ye Xiao stepped forward calmly and walked in.</p><p></p><p>Seeing Ye Xiao, the Sect Leader's eyes suddenly lit up. There was a strong greed in her gaze.</p><p></p><p>"What a handsome man. I didn't expect you to be able to find this place."</p><p></p><p>Ye Xiao swept a glance at the two of them.</p><p></p><p>One was a primordial seventh-grade divine beast, the other was a primordial eighth-grade divine beast. It seemed this was the right place.</p><p></p><p>"I've found you."</p>

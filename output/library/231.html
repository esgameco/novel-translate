        <h1>Chapter 231</h1>
        <div class="content">
            <p>Here is my translation of the Chinese excerpt you provided:</p><p></p><p>"Then activate the defensive formation around the Central Plains city. Also, tell the cultivators not to retreat in one direction, but to disperse and evacuate in different directions - let as many escape as possible."</p><p></p><p>A large city like the Central Plains already had its own defensive formation, and with the formation array, they could delay for some time.</p><p></p><p>"Okay!"</p><p></p><p>The people immediately carried out North Hall's instructions, and the next moment, the entire city was filled with alarm sirens.</p><p></p><p>"Attention all citizens, attention all citizens, the Central Plains city has entered a state of highest alert. All low-level cultivators, quickly evacuate to the north and south. Split into two groups and evacuate as quickly as possible."</p><p></p><p>Accompanying the sound of the alarm, five beams of light shot out from the east, south, west, north, and center of the city, converging in the sky to form a golden barrier that enveloped the entire city.</p><p></p><p>Seeing this, the citizens knew the situation was grave. Without hesitation, they quickly fled the city.</p><p></p><p>The dense crowds on the ground moved like a swarm of ants.</p><p></p><p>Yan Qian and the others walked with the flow of people, continuously dialing Ye Xiao's number.</p><p></p><p>"How is it? Have you gotten through to Manager Ye's number?"</p><p>Yan Qian anxiously stomped her foot.</p><p></p><p>"No, no one is answering."</p><p></p><p>"Keep trying, keep calling until he answers. We're moving too slowly, let's take a car, we can drive and call at the same time."</p><p></p><p>In the sky above, North Hall and the other Saint Monarch experts were rushing towards the riverside.</p><p></p><p>Although they could not stop these Saint Monarch experts from coming out, there was still hope to launch a sneak attack on them as they emerged, in order to deal them a heavy blow and increase the chances of victory.</p><p></p><p>Several streaks of light flashed across the sky as they arrived at the riverside.</p><p></p><p>The figure on the river did not need to sense their approach - he had already anticipated that they would come here.</p><p></p><p>So just as North Hall's group had just arrived at the riverside and not yet stabilized their footing, he immediately launched his attack.</p><p></p><p>Accompanied by his gnarled hands, he formed seals in the air, and the next moment, numerous bone spikes erupted from the riverbank, shooting towards the approaching Ancestral Monarch experts like high-pressure cannon shells.</p><p></p><p>Shi Guanghao let out a cold snort and unleashed a fist strike, the powerful energy rapidly expanding into a massive spiritual energy fist over a kilometer in diameter.</p><p></p><p>The fist and the bone spikes collided, generating a series of thunderous explosions that shook the air.</p><p></p><p>If these two attacks had struck the ground in the city center, their power would have been enough to destroy half of the Central Plains city! The explosive shockwaves dissipated, but several bone spikes still pierced through the center of the explosion, rushing towards the group at lightning speed.</p><p></p><p>The expressions of the others changed abruptly.</p><p></p><p>Only North Hall remained calm and composed. His eyes flickered, and his Demonic Fire Spirit Eyes activated, instantly detonating those bone spikes.</p><p></p><p>"Be careful, he is a Ninth-Grade Primal Cultivator. You all support me, I'll take the lead."</p><p></p><p>"Understood!"</p><p></p><p>The others responded, and North Hall unleashed his eye technique again.</p><p></p><p>The Demonic Fire Spirit Eyes instantly ignited the opponent's energy, causing a massive explosion that sent his body crashing violently into the ground, creating a huge crater in the riverbank.</p><p></p><p>"Good opportunity!"</p><p></p><p>Shi Guanghao and Lang Xinyue, the two Saint Monarchs, pursued him with even greater speed, unleashing over a thousand attacks in rapid succession, each one reaching the limit of their Eighth-Grade Primal cultivation.</p><p></p><p>"Phew, phew!"</p><p></p><p>The two panted heavily, their faces slightly pale, but as the dust settled, an expression of satisfaction appeared on their faces.</p><p></p><p>The Saint Monarch star beast on the ground had been beaten to the brink of death.</p><p></p><p>North Hall glanced at the scene.</p><p></p><p>"I knew it, this must be related to the few Saint Monarch star beasts that escaped from Shaolin. This one is the Venomous Dragon Scorpion Venerable, a Ninth-Grade Primal Saint Monarch star beast. His martial arts combat power is not high, only just entering the Ninth Grade Primal realm, but his true formidable ability is his poison! That's why he was so heavily injured by my Demonic Fire Spirit Eyes. You two, although only Eighth-Grade Primal, have long since reached the peak of that realm, and after I weakened him, your relentless attacks have severely injured his body. But to kill him, we still need to add one more strike!"</p><p></p><p>As he spoke, his eyes flickered, and the Demonic Fire Spirit Eyes unleashed an even more powerful force, directly blasting the Venomous Dragon Scorpion Venerable's body into two halves.</p><p></p><p>However, the group did not have time to catch their breath, as the disturbance of their attacks had also shattered the sealing formation on the Spiritual Energy Array above.</p><p></p><p>"Hahaha, after hundreds of years, we are finally free!"</p><p></p><p>"I can already smell the scent of human blood. Humans, I will devour you."</p><p></p><p>North Hall exchanged a glance, and Shi Guanghao and Lang Xinyue, along with the other Seventh-Grade Primal Saint Monarchs, immediately rushed over.</p><p></p><p>"Human Saint Monarchs! How interesting, just the right opportunity for us to stretch our limbs."</p><p></p><p>The two sides...</p><p></p><p>Here is the full English translation of the Chinese excerpt:</p><p></p><p>They fought side by side, and in the sky, shadows overlapped in an instant, radiating brilliance.</p><p></p><p>All the divine patriarchs had pushed their powers to the utmost.</p><p></p><p>This was a life-and-death battle, with no second chances, so whether it was the human divine patriarchs or the stellar beast divine patriarchs, they were now using their full strength.</p><p></p><p>At this moment, a green silhouette of a tree person quietly approached the Poisonous Dragon Scorpion Venerable from below.</p><p></p><p>"Hehe, old scorpion, since you came to save us, let me give you a hand and revive you."</p><p></p><p>Unfortunately, just as he was about to act, a scorching flame force was suddenly released upon him, starting to burn him.</p><p></p><p>"Ahâ€”!"</p><p></p><p>He suddenly let out a series of agonizing screams, diving back into the river water, trying to use the river water to extinguish the flames.</p><p></p><p>But strangely, no matter how he rolled in the river water, he could not extinguish the flames.</p><p></p><p>In the sky above, Beitang Ce looked at him with icy cold eyes.</p><p></p><p>"Ridiculous, do you think this old man eats for free? With your meager cultivation, you still want to revive the Poisonous Dragon Scorpion Venerable? What a delusion."</p><p></p><p>On the river surface, the battle between Shi Guanghao and the others became increasingly fierce.</p><p></p><p>The two sides were at a stalemate, but they could still maintain it for a short period of time.</p><p></p><p>Beitang Ce did not intervene, because he knew he was waiting for something. He wanted to conserve his strength to confront the strongest one next.</p><p></p><p>One second, two seconds, three seconds...</p><p></p><p>The clouds in the sky were getting heavier and heavier!</p><p></p><p>It seemed that some formidable existence was about to arrive.</p><p></p><p>At this time, the waves on the river surface, which were caused by the constant attacks of the divine patriarchs, began to gradually subside.</p><p></p><p>This was simply extremely bizarre.</p><p></p><p>It should be known that the river surface was already turbulent, and with the impact of the auras and spiritual energies of the various divine patriarchs, it would have been considered good if there were no huge waves.</p><p></p><p>But now, not only was there no wave disturbance on the river surface, but it had become as calm as a mirror, this completely polarized state was terrifying, making everyone's hair stand on end and their whole body start to sweat profusely.</p><p></p><p>Before long, a small whirlpool began to appear on the river surface, and then slowly expanded, as if opening a large door to the bottom of the river. A staircase as flat as a cement floor appeared in the whirlpool.</p><p></p><p>"He's here!"</p><p></p><p>Beitang Ce's pupils contracted, he had already sensed the other party's spiritual energy fluctuations.</p><p></p><p>It was an extremely terrifying aura, even more fearful than his own.</p><p></p><p>As his aura appeared, all the small stellar beasts around the Central State City began to get excited and rushed towards the Central State City crazily.</p><p></p><p>"Gulp."</p><p></p><p>Even a powerful eye technique master like Beitang Ce could not help but swallow a mouthful of saliva, with a deep sense of dread in his eyes.</p><p></p><p>A pseudo-divine realm stellar beast! The Sword God - Azuo Shana! An existence that was almost a divine beast!</p><p></p><p>Just like the King Realm experts of the human race, the divine beast realm experts of the stellar beasts, as long as they release their own aura, can summon the surrounding same-race beasts.</p><p></p><p>Although Azuo Shana was not yet a complete divine beast, he was already beginning to exude the aura of a divine beast.</p><p></p><p>Therefore, the stellar beasts around the city were all drawn by this aura and rushed over crazily.</p><p></p><p>Azuo Shana had already completely transformed into a human form, a tall eight-foot adult male, wearing a black coat, with long hair like a waterfall hanging on his back, looking like the tail of a long dragon.</p><p></p><p>He looked up and his gaze fell only on Beitang Ce, not even glancing at the other stellar beasts and human divine patriarchs present.</p><p></p><p>It was obvious that among the people present, apart from Beitang Ce, he didn't care about anyone else.</p><p></p><p>With a slight smile on the corner of his mouth, Azuo Shana slowly spoke.</p><p></p><p>"It's been a long time, Brother Beitang, I hope you've been well."</p><p></p><p>Beitang Ce's face was grave as he looked at him.</p><p></p><p>"It has been a long time indeed."</p><p></p><p>"I wonder if your eye technique has improved or declined over the years? That battle hundreds of years ago, I still miss it dearly. I hope Brother Beitang won't disappoint me."</p><p></p><p>"You'll find out."</p><p></p><p>Beitang Ce's eyes flickered, activating his Ghostly Fire Spirit Eyes, instantly locking onto Azuo Shana's body.</p><p></p><p>An invisible and mighty force pressed down straight at Azuo Shana, like Mount Tai pressing down.</p><p></p><p>But! His eye technique attack finally stopped two meters above Azuo Shana's head and could not advance any further.</p><p></p><p>Because, there was a golden sword beam blocking it on top of Azuo Shana's head.</p><p></p><p>No, not one, but a hundred sword beams, simultaneously blocking Beitang Ce's eye technique.</p>

        <h1>Chapter 73</h1>
        <div class="content">
            <p>Here is the full English translation of the Chinese excerpt:</p><p></p><p>*Cough, cough, cough.*</p><p></p><p>Ye Xiao emerged from a pile of messy rocks, dusting himself off and using the Repairing Heaven Technique to heal his injuries.</p><p></p><p>How embarrassing.</p><p></p><p>The speed of the Divine Will Technique was too fast. In that instant, he couldn't control it well - as soon as he activated the mental intent, his body was already up on the mountain. He didn't have time to stop himself and directly crashed into it.</p><p></p><p>Fortunately, he had already reached the cultivation level of a Grandmaster of the Fourth Realm, and his physical body had been strengthened to some degree. Plus, he had also cultivated a few body-tempering techniques, so he didn't sustain any serious injuries.</p><p></p><p>Otherwise, colliding with the entire mountain at such tremendous speed would have been enough to seriously hurt him.</p><p></p><p>After healing the scrapes on his body, Ye Xiao's spiritual sense detected several powerful auras approaching, so he once again activated the Divine Will Technique and departed towards the sky.</p><p></p><p>Soon after, several figures arrived.</p><p></p><p>They were none other than some Grandmasters from the Jianghai City, as well as the Professor of the Martial Arts Academy in the Capital, the Grandmaster Elder Long Feng.</p><p></p><p>Upon seeing the collapsed half of the mountain cliff, they were all startled.</p><p></p><p>"Such tremendous destructive power! This force is too strong!"</p><p></p><p>"This technique - without being at the Grandmaster level, it's impossible to unleash something like this! Elder Long, what do you think?"</p><p></p><p>Elder Long Feng stroked his chin, his expression grave. "Judging from the area of destruction, it must have been the work of a Grandmaster. But the attack pattern and the shape of the damage left me quite puzzled."</p><p></p><p>"How so?"</p><p></p><p>"Based on my many years of experience, this is the work of a martial art - a fist technique that caused this level of damage."</p><p></p><p>*Hiss!*</p><p></p><p>The others couldn't help but collectively suck in a sharp breath, their scalps tingling.</p><p></p><p>Jianghai City already had one Grandmaster swordsman and one Grandmaster in a blade art. Now, it seems there was also a Grandmaster of the fist arts!</p><p></p><p>With three Grandmasters, "What's going on with our Jianghai City? How did we end up with three Grandmasters?"</p><p></p><p>Elder Long Feng let out a long sigh.</p><p></p><p>"Actually, Jianghai City has even more than just those three Grandmasters.</p><p></p><p>When I returned today, Tianyu reported to me that Jianghai City currently has one high-level healer, and one powerful spiritual cultivator, both estimated to be at least at the Grandmaster realm or above."</p><p></p><p>Hearing this, the others were completely dumbfounded. The air fell silent, save for the howling wind blowing through the large hole just blasted in the mountain.</p><p></p><p>Jianghai City must be harboring some incredible treasure!</p><p></p><p>On Ye Xiao's end, he was testing and practicing his movement techniques in the starry sky. After a while, he finally got used to the operating mode of the Divine Will Technique and could freely control its activation and deactivation.</p><p></p><p>This was thanks to his Grandmaster cultivation, which allowed him to fly freely in the air and practice.</p><p></p><p>If he had tried this on the ground, he didn't know how many things he would have crashed into.</p><p></p><p>Currently, the speed of the Divine Will Technique was quite impressive.</p><p></p><p>Originally, his speed was already slightly faster than the speed of sound, which is 1,224 km/h. Now, he could fly at around 6,500 km/h, or 1,800 m/s.</p><p></p><p>This speed wasn't actually that extraordinary. After all, the Divine Will Technique was no ordinary technique - it was several times more powerful than typical Grandmaster-level techniques.</p><p></p><p>As a top-tier movement art in this high-martial world, Ye Xiao felt this speed was quite reasonable.</p><p></p><p>Compared to the gods in novels who could create the heavens and earth, this level of speed was far from being as exaggerated.</p><p></p><p>Here is the full English translation of the Chinese excerpt:</p><p></p><p>However, he is currently only a Heaven-Ranked Fourth Realm Grand Master. If he can break through further, his speed should increase even more.</p><p></p><p>But no matter what, he is still far from the speed of light.</p><p></p><p>The speed of sound is only about one-nine-hundred-thousandth of the speed of light, and he has only just surpassed the speed of sound by a little more than five times.</p><p></p><p>"I wonder what my current top speed is?"</p><p></p><p>Ye Xiao looked up at the starry sky overhead, took a deep breath, and a hint of intense curiosity flashed in his eyes.</p><p></p><p>"Now that I'm a Grand Master, with my spiritual energy shielding me, I can avoid the radiation of the sun and the lack of oxygen at high altitudes. Maybe I should..."</p><p></p><p>At the same time, in a research base hanging the American flag in the starry sky, a technological experiment was underway.</p><p></p><p>The base commander and a group of scientists stood at the window, monitoring the data on the large screen.</p><p></p><p>The screen showed three mysterious, futuristic-looking fighter jets rapidly flying through the night sky, their speed causing adrenaline to surge, as they demonstrated climbing, rapid acceleration, and agile maneuvering.</p><p></p><p>A scientist briefed the commander:</p><p></p><p>"This brand new aircraft model uses several newly discovered space-sourced materials to create a lightweight, ultra-durable alloy that can withstand the intense stresses of sustained high-speed combat operations that previous fighters could not.</p><p></p><p>Although its power is so great that the pilot requires exceptional physical fitness and reaction time, reaching the Grand Master realm, it can unleash flight speeds and attack power rivaling that of a Grand Realm Master.</p><p></p><p>In simple terms, it can turn a Master into a Grand Master!</p><p></p><p>This will propel the entire American continent to a new and enduring peak of power."</p><p></p><p>A burning intensity flickered in the commander's eyes.</p><p></p><p>Excellent! Truly excellent!</p><p></p><p>Cultivating martial arts is as difficult as ascending to the heavens. </p><p></p><p>To train an ordinary person into a Master takes a very long time. And to train a Master into a Grand Master takes even longer! But now, with this fighter, they can massively boost the strength of their Masters, turning an entire army's Masters into Grand Masters. The terrifying scale of that advancement is beyond the imagination of normal humans.</p><p></p><p>With this, the American continent will completely dominate the space battlefield, and then control the discourse power of the entire human race, easily suppressing the experts of other continents. They can then collect the martial arts talents and techniques from the other continents to further strengthen America's power.</p><p></p><p>"Can this fighter jet be mass-produced already?"</p><p></p><p>"It requires your approval, Commander."</p><p></p><p>"I approve. Immediately report to the American Space Defense Department to begin full-scale production of this new fighter. If it succeeds, America's strength will see another tremendous boost in a short time. Our top-tier power will be further consolidated."</p><p></p><p>"Very well. I'll have the pilots fly the jets back, log the test data, optimize it, and directly submit the production proposal to the Space Defense Department."</p><p></p><p>The pilots in the cockpits simultaneously received the recall order and prepared to return the aircraft.</p><p></p><p>However, at that moment, one of the pilots suddenly noticed a red dot appearing on his radar screen.</p>

        <h1>Chapter 263</h1>
        <div class="content">
            <p>Here is the full English translation of the Chinese excerpt:</p><p></p><p>Ye Xiao's heart suddenly skipped a beat.</p><p></p><p>He felt that his thoughts were a bit crazy.</p><p></p><p>If his thoughts were true, the future of humanity would face dangers far beyond the Star Beasts.</p><p></p><p>It's even possible that there could be a far greater danger than the Star Beasts!</p><p></p><p>It seems that in the future, he needs to find more dragon qi.</p><p></p><p>However, if the rumor about a certain emperor ordering his subordinates to destroy all dragon veins within the Nine Provinces is true, that would be very troublesome.</p><p></p><p>In that case, he would not be able to find any dragon veins, so how could he refine the dragon qi from them?</p><p></p><p>This matter made Ye Xiao feel troubled again.</p><p></p><p>Forget it, it's better not to think about that for now, just take it one step at a time.</p><p></p><p>After all, he already has a weak dragon qi, and he is gradually refining his body.</p><p></p><p>As long as it can continue to exist like this, sooner or later it will refine his entire body.</p><p></p><p>It's just a matter of how fast or slow.</p><p></p><p>The problem he should be considering now is whether he should focus on refining imperial arts and fusing them into Slaughter God Techniques, as well as improving his cultivation.</p><p></p><p>After all, no matter how strong his bloodline is, cultivation is the most important.</p><p></p><p>Without sufficient cultivation, nothing else matters.</p><p></p><p>After a day of reading, Ye Xiao refined another imperial art, a fist technique called the Bright Emperor Fist.</p><p></p><p>This fist technique is relatively mediocre, similar to the Thunderous Emperor Fist he refined from the Thunderous Azure Ox, but not as good as the Great Extinction Fist.</p><p></p><p>But overall, it's still a pretty decent fist technique.</p><p></p><p>It's just that Ye Xiao has too many fist techniques now, so he doesn't pay much attention to it.</p><p></p><p>If it were in the hands of an ordinary person, they would probably fight over it and bleed profusely.</p><p></p><p>Moreover, Ye Xiao doesn't need to use it, he only needs it to synthesize a Slaughter God Technique.</p><p></p><p>After refining the Bright Emperor Fist, it was also time to get off work.</p><p></p><p>Liucheng Xun originally asked Ye Xiao if he wanted to have dinner together, but Ye Xiao naturally refused.</p><p></p><p>Because he had already made an appointment with Wang Dailong, who would send him black obsidian in the evening.</p><p></p><p>When he returned home, there was already a large truck parked at the door, completely full of black obsidian.</p><p></p><p>What Ye Xiao didn't expect was that the driver was not Wang Dailong, but Xu Daomao.</p><p></p><p>"What are you doing here?"</p><p></p><p>"That's a question I should be asking you. I was puzzled before about which strange customer would want such a large amount of useless black obsidian. I didn't expect it to be you!"</p><p></p><p>Ye Xiao was quite speechless.</p><p></p><p>"Didn't I ask Wang Dailong to bring it? Why did you come instead of him?"</p><p></p><p>"Wang Dailong and my father have partnered up to start a larger company. In the future, if you need to buy materials, you can go directly to our company."</p><p></p><p>Xu Daomao handed over a business card.</p><p></p><p>On it was printed her name, the company name "Xu Wang United Trade Materials Co., Ltd.", and her title "Deputy General Manager, Xu Daomao".</p><p></p><p>Ye Xiao couldn't help but twitch the corner of his mouth.</p><p></p><p>"You're still the deputy general manager?"</p><p></p><p>"Of course, my dad is one of the directors. I have to be a deputy manager, otherwise where would my dad's face be?"</p><p></p><p>In fact, what puzzled Ye Xiao was not this.</p><p></p><p>It was that Xu Daomao was already a deputy general manager, so why was she still driving a truck?</p><p></p><p>"How many people are there in your company?"</p><p></p><p>Xu Daomao thought for a moment.</p><p></p><p>"Excluding the directors, and including me, there are a total of six deputy general managers. Basically, each family contributes one. Wang Dailong is the chairman and general manager.</p><p></p><p>Our company is very large, aren't you shocked? It's grown many times more than before."</p><p></p><p>Ye Xiao nodded.</p><p></p><p>"Yes, I'm quite shocked.</p><p></p><p>Your family's materials shop was doing well, why did you stop doing that?"</p><p></p><p>"In the past, it was difficult to buy materials, so our family could still use the small materials shop to make a profit by reselling.</p><p></p><p>But now, the city is expanding, and many merchants from outside have squeezed in, wanting a share of the pie.</p><p></p><p>There are more and more stores, and they are all big ones.</p><p></p><p>In business, it's always the big eating the small, the small being eaten.</p><p></p><p>So my dad had to team up with a few friends to start a larger materials company.</p><p></p><p>But you'd better not buy materials recently. Because during this period, the city is expanding, and the merchants have just arrived, so many materials are not fully stocked yet.</p><p></p><p>But the population has already flooded in in large numbers.</p><p></p><p>All kinds of martial arts resources are in short supply, and all materials have been rising sharply in price recently.</p><p></p><p>Only black obsidian, which no one wants, has not risen in price.</p><p></p><p>But after this period, it will get better, and when the materials are fully stocked, the prices will become cheaper and cheaper."</p><p></p><p>Ye Xiao nodded, and Xu Daomao spoke again:</p><p></p><p>"Where should I put this stuff? I need to unload it for you now, I still have other goods to deliver."</p><p></p><p>Ye Xiao pointed to the empty space next to the courtyard.</p><p></p><p>"Just put it there."</p><p></p><p>Black obsidian itself is not a valuable thing, and there's no need to worry about someone stealing it.</p><p></p><p>Since there's no room inside the courtyard, it's better to just put it outside.</p><p></p><p>Here is the full English translation of the Chinese excerpt:</p><p></p><p>"Alright, I'll start moving them for you now."</p><p></p><p>"Do you need me to help you move them?"</p><p></p><p>"No need, our company's policy is 'delivery to your doorstep, you unload it yourself.' We absolutely won't let the customer lift a finger. Just fill out a survey form and give me a good review."</p><p></p><p>As she spoke, Xu Daomao rolled up her sleeves, revealing her massive arms that were thicker than Ye Xiao's head and covered in dense body hair.</p><p></p><p>Seeing her bear-like physique, Ye Xiao didn't say anything more, and took a customer satisfaction survey form from her truck.</p><p></p><p>"Is this the thing?"</p><p></p><p>"Yes, that's the one. I'll move the stuff, you just fill that out for me."</p><p></p><p>"Okay."</p><p></p><p>Next, Ye Xiao started filling out the survey form while Xu Daomao unleashed her Popeye-like strength and quickly began moving the obsidian.</p><p></p><p>By the time Ye Xiao leisurely finished filling out the form, Xu Daomao had already unloaded all the obsidian.</p><p></p><p>This made Ye Xiao marvel at the power of cultivators. If this were on Earth, it would have taken half a day to move it all.</p><p></p><p>Xu Daomao finished in just a few minutes - she was truly impressive.</p><p></p><p>He handed her the filled-out form.</p><p></p><p>"Here, I gave you a five-star review. Want to come in for a cup of tea?"</p><p></p><p>"No need, my dad doesn't let me go into men's houses, especially yours. He said I need to be extra careful around you."</p><p></p><p>Ye Xiao: (╯°□°)╯</p><p></p><p>He didn't expect the memory he had implanted in Xu Daomao to still exist.</p><p></p><p>Back then, when he was still weak, he was worried that others might find out his identity through Xu Daomao, so he had modified Xu Daomao's memory, changing the money he had earned from selling throwing knives to him into money he had won from gambling with Xu Daomao. After that, Xu Daomao no longer welcomed him.</p><p></p><p>But this was for the best, it was better than him constantly trying to get Ye Xiao to be his son-in-law.</p><p></p><p>Looking at Xu Daomao's burly physique, it was enough to turn any man from a "wood" to a "great" or even a "big."</p><p></p><p>"Since that's the case, I won't keep you any longer. I'll transfer the payment to Wang Dalong later."</p><p></p><p>"Okay, goodbye."</p><p></p><p>Xu Daomao jumped back onto the large truck, shifted gears, and the long cargo truck quickly drove away from Ye Xiao.</p><p></p><p>"What a formidable woman!" </p><p></p><p>Ye Xiao couldn't help but shake his head, then looked at the obsidian in front of him, a smile spreading across his face.</p><p></p><p>"Time to start refining."</p><p></p><p>He returned to the courtyard, and through the wall, directly unleashed his divine craftsmanship to extract the spatial power from the obsidian and infuse it into the meteorite steel he had forged.</p><p></p><p>The meteorite steel itself did not possess the ability to absorb spatial power, but Ye Xiao had embedded some spatial amethyst into it, granting it this property.</p><p></p><p>The Beastmaster Alliance Master's spatial ring also contained a bit of spatial amethyst, which itself held a large amount of spatial power.</p><p></p><p>Ye Xiao gathered all the spatial power from these two sources and condensed it together.</p><p></p><p>In the blink of an eye, a powerful farmland base with spatial scaling properties was completed.</p><p></p><p>Ye Xiao estimated that it was about the size of a small 100-200 meter hill inside.</p><p></p><p>Although not too large, it was more than enough for his needs.</p><p></p><p>He first inscribed the Dizhao Tiangao Formation on the base to provide defense, and then inscribed the Dutian Guangyuan Formation to absorb spiritual energy.</p><p></p><p>Then, he inputted a large amount of soil to create some artificial mountains and the like.</p><p></p><p>Because not all heavenly materials and earthly treasures need to be exposed to sunlight every day.</p><p></p><p>Many require growing in shaded areas, where they are more interested in moonlight.</p><p></p><p>In addition, some even need to be buried underground.</p><p></p><p>And Ye Xiao wanted to use honey to brew wine, so he buried it within the mountain, inscribing formations to facilitate the brewing and collection of more spiritual energy.</p><p></p><p>Ye Xiao was busy for three full nights before finally completing all the planting and arrangements.</p><p></p><p>Meanwhile, Dou Changfeng was also starting to have a headache.</p><p></p><p>The expansion of a city involves not just enlarging the city, nor just arranging some formations.</p><p></p><p>It also brings in many cultivators joining the city.</p><p></p><p>With so many people suddenly pouring in, various problems need to be considered.</p><p></p><p>From people's livelihoods to cultivation resources, nothing can be neglected.</p><p></p><p>And right now, there was a major problem - the city's cultivation resources were insufficient.</p><p></p><p>Whether it was weapons, materials, or pills and refining materials, everything was in short supply.</p><p></p><p>The prices of many things were even starting to rise continuously.</p><p></p><p>This was unavoidable, as the Nine Realms Alliance could not suddenly concentrate so many resources.</p><p></p><p>This was the growing pains of a city's integration.</p><p></p><p>"City Lord, there was another fight between cultivators in the north of the city today."</p><p></p><p>"What happened?"</p><p></p><p>"It was still over the issue of resources. They fought brutally to seize a forged steel saber, and one of them was sent to the hospital due to serious injuries."</p><p></p><p>Hearing this, Dou Changfeng felt his head ache.</p><p></p><p>(Six updates, 18,000 words.

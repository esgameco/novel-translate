        <h1>Chapter 54</h1>
        <div class="content">
            <p>Here is the full English translation of the Chinese excerpt:</p><p></p><p>Ye Xiao murmured a sentence.</p><p></p><p>He could tell with his little toe that the benefits of exposing his identity were far less than the drawbacks.</p><p></p><p>What could the Alliance give him? Nothing more than cultivation resources, status and power, money and women.</p><p></p><p>Status and power, money and women - those are just fleeting clouds. As long as his cultivation is strong enough, he can have as much as he wants, right?</p><p></p><p>But if his cultivation is lost, they'll all disappear in the blink of an eye.</p><p></p><p>The only precious thing is the cultivation resources.</p><p></p><p>But Ye Xiao was not like the others, who needed to pile up resources to cultivate. </p><p></p><p>He only needed to read books, and the divine books would automatically cultivate his spirit and soul.</p><p></p><p>In this way, the only useful thing also becomes useless.</p><p></p><p>And what does the Alliance want? Possibly to send him to the frontlines. </p><p></p><p>Or to make him train a group of disciples.</p><p></p><p>Or to have him carry out certain secret operations for them, like dealing with cultivators from other states, assassinations, intelligence gathering...</p><p></p><p>These are all potentially life-threatening tasks.</p><p></p><p>His current cultivation is at the Innate Fourth Rank, a Grand Master. </p><p></p><p>Although he can defeat enemies above his rank, at most he can contend with Grand Masters at their peak, or those who have just stepped into the Divine Realm.</p><p></p><p>But in this world, there are also Divine Realm Perfected, and existences even beyond the Divine Realm.</p><p></p><p>And Ye Xiao knew with his little toe that after exposing his identity, it would be impossible for him to refuse to dedicate himself.</p><p></p><p>Because the Nine States already have those top-tier experts who can just imprint a spiritual brand on you, and even a Grand Master would have to obediently become their dog.</p><p></p><p>Ye Xiao didn't want to entrust his fate to others.</p><p></p><p>It's not that he wants to hide forever, but at least he wants to wait until he's unrivaled in the world before exposing himself, right?</p><p></p><p>Those Patriarchs and Grand Masters, which of them didn't become famous only after their thirties, forties or fifties?</p><p></p><p>He's only twenty, he has a long way to go. He'll just stay in the library and read for ten or eight more years.</p><p></p><p>With the speed of cultivation from the divine books, by then he'll most likely be beyond the Divine Realm.</p><p></p><p>Wonderful.</p><p></p><p>Ye Xiao felt comforted by his mature mentality.</p><p></p><p>It's also thanks to his two lifetimes of experience, his soul is mature enough, unlike those hairless brats who get a little bit of ability and start to strut around, looking down on everyone, and end up getting slapped to death like swatting a mosquito.</p><p></p><p>"Duang~"</p><p></p><p>The sound of the off-work bell rang, awakening Ye Xiao from his deep thoughts.</p><p></p><p>Ning Yuhen walked over carrying a thick stack of documents, looking quite exhausted after counting them all day, her flushed little face and damp hair from the sweat.</p><p></p><p>"Manager Ye, I've finished counting all the books and recorded them in the registry. I'll input them into the computer this afternoon."</p><p></p><p>"You've worked hard."</p><p></p><p>Ning Yuhen gave a soft smile.</p><p></p><p>"Since the manager has promoted me, I must work even harder to live up to the manager's cultivation."</p><p></p><p>Ye Xiao closed the book and said indifferently:</p><p></p><p>"Let's go, you've worked hard all morning. I'll treat you to lunch today."</p><p></p><p>"No, let me treat the manager instead. How can I let the manager treat me?"</p><p></p><p>"Cut the flattery, I don't like it."</p><p></p><p>Ning Yuhen stuck out her tongue, put down the documents in her hands, and followed Ye Xiao out of the library.</p><p></p><p>Ye Xiao wasn't stingy, after all he had just been promoted, so he should have some 'leadership' quality.</p><p></p><p>So he took Ning Yuhen to have a big serving of spicy hot pot.</p><p></p><p>One hundred and eight servings, almost a month's rent for him.</p><p></p><p>"Sss~!"</p><p></p><p>Ning Yuhen had just taken a few bites when the spiciness made her stick out her tongue. Her already rosy little face became even redder.</p><p></p><p>She waved her hand while fanning her mouth...</p><p></p><p>Here is the full English translation of the Chinese excerpt:</p><p></p><p>Waving his little hands, he quickly fanned the air towards his small mouth, while hurriedly pouring himself some water to rinse his mouth. If it were a normal guy doing such actions, countless men and women would have been disgusted and nauseated by now. But Ning Yuheng's movements somehow captivated many of the male diners in the restaurant, who secretly stole glances at him.</p><p></p><p>Ye Xiao was a bit speechless, this guy was really too much of a national calamity.</p><p></p><p>Normally, if a guy is too effeminate, he would definitely invite disgust and nausea from both men and women.</p><p></p><p>But Ning Yuheng was different, he genuinely possessed a feminine charm.</p><p></p><p>Not overly coquettish, but with a touch of innocence, completely natural and unaffected.</p><p></p><p>Truly a threat to steal the rice bowls of women!</p><p></p><p>He really should go to Taizhou and get surgery.</p><p></p><p>"Whew! So spicy!"</p><p></p><p>After taking a sip of water, he finally felt better.</p><p></p><p>At this moment, a young-looking male student approached him, shyly waving his phone.</p><p></p><p>"Uh, Miss, can I add you on WeChat?"</p><p></p><p>Ning Yuheng was taken aback, his face instantly flushing red.</p><p></p><p>"I-I'm not a girl, I'm a guy."</p><p></p><p>Hearing these words and that voice, the other party was stunned, clearly not expecting this. But his eyes soon seemed to shine even brighter.</p><p></p><p>"Then, Brother, can I add you on WeChat?"</p><p></p><p>Ye Xiao was coughing from being choked by this statement.</p><p></p><p>This kid was not playing by the rules at all.</p><p></p><p>Knowing N and going for it?</p><p></p><p>Ning Yuheng's face turned even redder, but after taking a deep breath, he still refused.</p><p></p><p>Then he found a small bowl, filled it with mineral water, and finally finished his meal by rinsing with the water.</p><p></p><p>It was already past 2 pm, and the two of them left to go to work.</p><p></p><p>As they passed a traffic light, a small car rushed through the yellow light in three seconds, grazing a cat crossing the road.</p><p></p><p>"Meow meow meow."</p><p></p><p>The small cat's body was flung, rolling to the side of the road, its spine seemingly injured. It was wailing in agony, struggling but unable to get up.</p><p></p><p>Ning Yuheng immediately stepped forward and gently cradled the cat.</p><p></p><p>"Little kitty, don't be afraid, relax."</p><p></p><p>Ye Xiao glanced over, about to step in and use his healing technique, when suddenly a faint glow emanated from Ning Yuheng's small hands.</p><p></p><p>Under this healing light, the cat's injuries were quickly mended.</p><p></p><p>Ye Xiao's pupils constricted.</p><p></p><p>Because at that moment, he sensed a faint aura of a star beast from Ning Yuheng.</p><p></p><p>It was very weak, almost negligible.</p><p></p><p>Even a great master might not have easily detected it.</p><p></p><p>But Ye Xiao had cultivated the Taixuan Tiangong, his spiritual power was several times that of a great master, so he could clearly perceive it.</p><p></p><p>At the same time, the divine spirit of the Golden Book within him stirred.</p><p></p><p>It was a healing technique!</p><p></p><p>Ning Yuheng's healing technique was a fundamental healing art that Ye Xiao did not currently possess.</p><p></p><p>He had already collected nine healing arts, and now he was missing the last one to complete a powerful healing system. Unexpectedly, he found it in Ning Yuheng.</p><p></p><p>However, the faint star beast aura that Ning Yuheng just revealed, what was that all about?</p><p></p><p>Was it a tiger beast?</p><p></p><p>No, if it were a tiger beast, there would be a spiritual imprint of the star beast's consciousness controlling his soul.</p><p></p><p>But Ning Yuheng's soul was pure.</p><p></p><p>Could it be that he was...</p><p></p><p>(End of chapter)</p>

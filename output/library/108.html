        <h1>Chapter 108</h1>
        <div class="content">
            <p>Here is the full English translation of the Chinese excerpt:</p><p></p><p>Old Master Qin was very shrewd.</p><p></p><p>He had two sons - the elder son Qin Mingyu, who was also the father of Qin Yingyan, was arranged by him to enter the Star Battlefield.</p><p></p><p>The younger son Qin Mingfeng was arranged by him to enter the renowned Great Force Mercenary Group in the Central Plains.</p><p></p><p>The two brothers, one went to the military, the other went into business, and they developed together.</p><p></p><p>In this way, the Qin family had two preparations.</p><p></p><p>Whether it was in the Star Battlefield in the sky or in the business world on the ground, they had certain connections and social networks.</p><p></p><p>Whichever side developed, it could ensure that the Qin family would be prosperous and thriving for a long time.</p><p></p><p>Qin Yingyan soon arrived at the Great Force Mercenary Group's branch in Jianghai City, and in the office, she saw her uncle Qin Mingfeng.</p><p></p><p>"Uncle."</p><p></p><p>The over-forty-year-old Qin Mingfeng had a rugged face, a square jaw, and looked rather serious.</p><p></p><p>But after seeing Qin Yingyan, he immediately showed a smile.</p><p></p><p>"It's Yingyan who has come. Come, sit down quickly."</p><p></p><p>He then put down the documents in his hand and personally poured tea for Qin Yingyan, completely disregarding his status as an elder, and was extremely doting towards Qin Yingyan.</p><p></p><p>Qin Yingyan hurriedly stood up to take the tea.</p><p></p><p>"Uncle, I've told you so many times, you are the elder, you shouldn't always pour tea for me."</p><p></p><p>"I dote on my niece, why should I put on the airs of an elder?"</p><p></p><p>"Uncle, I'm not a child anymore, I can pour the tea myself."</p><p></p><p>"Even if you're a hundred years old, you'll still be a child in your uncle's eyes. If you were a boy, your uncle wouldn't just pour tea for you, I'd also make you work hard and suffer. But who would have thought that in our Qin family, you are the only little princess."</p><p></p><p>Qin Yingyan smiled and took a sip of the tea, unable to help but ask:</p><p></p><p>"By the way, uncle, weren't you doing well in Lingnan City? Why were you suddenly transferred back to Jianghai City?"</p><p></p><p>Qin Mingfeng sat back in his position and sighed deeply.</p><p></p><p>"Don't even mention it. Recently, I was leading a team in Lingnan to capture star beasts, but due to an error in information, we almost had the entire team wiped out. If it weren't for a powerful person who came to our aid, you might have been burning paper money for your uncle by now.</p><p></p><p>That's why the headquarters asked me to come back to Jianghai City to calm down and develop the branch here as well."</p><p></p><p>"That dangerous?" Qin Yingyan was somewhat shocked, and Qin Mingfeng nodded solemnly.</p><p></p><p>"Beyond your imagination dangerous. Our intelligence was wrong, and we encountered a Black Scale Snake that was above the Grandmaster level.</p><p></p><p>Fortunately, a high-level swordsman happened to pass by, slew it with a single sword strike, and even used healing arts to heal us.</p><p></p><p>Even so, we still lost several teammates, who were directly corroded by the Black Scale Snake's poison without leaving a trace."</p><p></p><p>"A high-level swordsman?" Qin Yingyan was even more shocked, and Qin Mingfeng continued:</p><p></p><p>"That's right, but unfortunately I didn't get a good look at his appearance. At the time, the situation was urgent, and he suddenly appeared, his entire body wrapped in a golden light. Then he swung his sword, and the entire world was shrouded in a hazy mist, and I passed out.</p><p></p><p>When I woke up, I found that we had all been healed. Although I don't know for sure if it was him who used the healing arts, that healer must have been a top-tier one!</p><p></p><p>But he appeared and left so quickly, and there was no one else around when we regained consciousness, so it's likely that he was the one who healed us.</p><p></p><p>This person is truly an extraordinary expert, not only with incredible sword dao cultivation, but also such powerful healing arts! He is truly a rare strong one in the world."</p><p></p><p>Qin Mingfeng praised in admiration.</p><p></p><p>Here is my translation of the Chinese excerpt:</p><p></p><p>Lian Lian, while Qin Yuyan had already fallen into deep shock.</p><p></p><p>The powerful figure in the golden light, why did he sound so much like Senior Dao Ke?</p><p></p><p>After all, Senior Dao Ke was elusive, and Jianghai City and Lingnan were quite close, so it wouldn't be surprising for Senior Dao Ke to appear in Lingnan. But how could Senior Dao Ke also cultivate the Sword Dao?</p><p></p><p>Although Senior Dao Ke was very strong, in this world, there were extremely few people who could comprehend and cultivate more than two martial arts to the extreme. It was almost impossible for such a person to exist! But Second Uncle had also said that the other party might be a super expert who had integrated the Sword Dao and healing arts.</p><p></p><p>Didn't he himself already break the common logic of this world?</p><p></p><p>Since he had already broken the common logic, what was wrong with cultivating another sword art? Thinking about this, Qin Yuyan's heartbeat started to accelerate.</p><p></p><p>Even she herself felt that her thoughts were a bit crazy.</p><p></p><p>"Yuyan! Yuyan?"</p><p></p><p>Soon, Second Uncle's call made Qin Yuyan snap out of her chaotic thoughts.</p><p></p><p>"Ah?"</p><p></p><p>"Why have you been daydreaming?"</p><p></p><p>"Oh, nothing, I was just thinking about some other things. Oh yes, Grandpa wants us to have dinner together tonight."</p><p></p><p>"Okay."</p><p></p><p>As soon as the words fell, a secretary in professional attire, wearing black stockings and with a slender figure, walked in carrying a large box.</p><p></p><p>"Mr. Qin, these are the weapons purchased by the branch company this month. Please check them, and if there's no problem, please help me sign the order, I'll go to the finance department to report it."</p><p></p><p>"Let me take a look."</p><p></p><p>The secretary placed the box on the desk, and Qin Yuyan immediately stood up.</p><p></p><p>"Second Uncle, shall I go outside first?"</p><p></p><p>After all, these things involved company secrets, and she didn't know if it was appropriate for her to see them.</p><p></p><p>However, Qin Mingfeng waved his hand.</p><p></p><p>"No need, you are my niece, how can I not trust you?"</p><p></p><p>He then directly opened the box to inspect it.</p><p></p><p>There were a total of twenty super-grade alloy steel knives, five super-grade pure iron longswords, and a set of ordinary-grade armor.</p><p></p><p>"Why didn't they buy more armor?"</p><p></p><p>"Jianghai City has been relatively peaceful this year, and there aren't many star beasts, so the headquarters has appropriately reduced the budget.</p><p></p><p>Another reason is that we used the budget to purchase this master-level throwing knife."</p><p></p><p>"Master-level throwing knife?"</p><p></p><p>Qin Mingfeng then noticed that the secretary also had a small box in her hand.</p><p></p><p>The secretary placed the box on the desk and opened it, revealing a throwing knife only as long as a middle finger, emitting a dark, cold glimmer.</p><p></p><p>Qin Mingfeng's pupils suddenly contracted.</p><p></p><p>"A good item."</p><p></p><p>As a warrior who had fought against star beasts for many years, he had used countless weapons.</p><p></p><p>When he saw this weapon, he immediately knew that it was an excellent one.</p><p></p><p>Qin Yuyan curiously leaned in.</p><p></p><p>"This seems to be a weapon forged from pure iron. For them to be able to forge a master-level throwing knife from pure iron is truly impressive."</p><p></p><p>Qin Mingfeng held the throwing knife in his hand, weighed it, and then frantically infused his spiritual energy into it.</p><p></p><p>The next moment, after receiving a large amount of spiritual energy, a faint white light began to emanate from the blade.</p>

        <h1>Chapter 64</h1>
        <div class="content">
            <p>Here is the full English translation of the Chinese excerpt:</p><p></p><p>It was the local program team of Jianghai City, who publicly announced that they had found the two powerful figures, and would conduct an exclusive interview with them at 7 o'clock tonight.</p><p></p><p>This couldn't help but make Ye Xiao raise his eyebrows slightly.</p><p></p><p>He was well aware that these two guys were definitely fakes.</p><p></p><p>But why would they create two fakes?</p><p></p><p>To stabilize the people's hearts?</p><p></p><p>Clearly impossible, as there had been no major upheaval in Jianghai City recently, and the common people were living a comfortable and prosperous life, so why would they need to stabilize their hearts? Could it be to lure him out? After all, everyone outside knew that he was an extraordinary expert, and experts like him must have a temper.</p><p></p><p>If someone impersonated him, how could he just sit back and watch? He would surely make an appearance.</p><p></p><p>However, it's a pity that they miscalculated. Ye Xiao was not an old stubborn man who cared about face. He was a young man, and he really didn't have much to get angry about someone impersonating him.</p><p></p><p>What's the big deal? No one's going to die.</p><p></p><p>As long as there's no insult or defamation, he doesn't care about anything else.</p><p></p><p>"Manager, let's go to the TV station tonight and wait there. I heard the TV station is doing an outdoor live broadcast today."</p><p></p><p>"No need to go."</p><p></p><p>"Huh? Why not? Don't you want to see those two super experts that the whole of Jianghai City is curious about?"</p><p></p><p>"Even if I see them, what's the point? Can I eat them? Or can they help me improve my cultivation? I'd rather go home and sleep."</p><p></p><p>Ning Yuthen was stunned for a moment, then shook his head.</p><p></p><p>He found it very difficult to understand the manager's thoughts, and he also found it hard to agree with the manager's concept.</p><p></p><p>Those were two extraordinary experts, rarely seen like the legendary dragon. </p><p></p><p>"If you're not going, then I'll go by myself. But today, I won't be able to treat you to a meal."</p><p></p><p>He was definitely going to go.</p><p></p><p>Ning Yuthen could guess that one of those experts must have been the one who saved him.</p><p></p><p>So no matter what, he had to go and take a look, and if possible, express his gratitude to that expert.</p><p></p><p>"No problem, we can do it another day," Ye Xiao responded casually.</p><p></p><p>After get off work, he went home with the Jade Cat, while Ning Yuthen went to the TV station.</p><p></p><p>Ye Xiao was about to start experimenting with forging weapons.</p><p></p><p>In the forging techniques he was currently learning, he had summarized a total of four basic cultivation methods, and had imprinted them in his divine soul.</p><p></p><p>Although he had not yet synthesized the top-tier forging technique, he still needed to experiment in advance and practice the techniques.</p><p></p><p>He bought some raw materials from a materials shop, all ordinary pig iron, spending around a thousand or so.</p><p></p><p>For the first time, Ye Xiao didn't plan to use such good materials.</p><p></p><p>It was just practice, so he could just mess around with it.</p><p></p><p>The amount of materials wasn't much, 80 cents per jin, a total of over a thousand jin, but since it was iron, the volume wasn't very large, only a few cubic meters, not even as big as a table.</p><p></p><p>Back home, Ye Xiao immediately began the forging.</p><p></p><p>In his previous life, Ye Xiao had read many novels where forging weapons or refining elixirs required flames.</p><p></p><p>But here, spiritual energy alone was sufficient.</p><p></p><p>Spiritual energy was omnipotent, it just presented itself differently depending on the cultivation method used.</p><p></p><p>When using the forging technique, it would increase the temperature of the manifested spiritual energy, slightly refining the impurities in the materials, and shaping them.</p><p></p><p>Under Ye Xiao's control, over a thousand jin of pig iron was quickly forged into aç²¾iron long sword.</p><p></p><p>The sword was three chi and three cun long, but its weight was far beyond that of an ordinary three chi and three cun sword.</p><p></p><p>Because it had condensed a large amount of iron essence, its weight reached over forty jin.</p><p></p><p>Here is the full English translation of the Chinese excerpt:</p><p></p><p>After calculating, the ratio is close to 30:1, and the retention rate is still acceptable.</p><p></p><p>After all, more than a thousand catties of pig iron, only costing more than a thousand dollars, is still very cost-effective.</p><p></p><p>The weight of the sword gives it higher rigidity. When slaying the star beasts, in addition to protecting the sword body itself, it can also be infused with spiritual energy, withstanding the surging of spiritual energy within, and inflicting greater damage on the star beasts.</p><p></p><p>In short, it's more powerful! Ye Xiao originally wanted to try it out, with the sword enhancement, to see how much power it could increase.</p><p></p><p>But after careful consideration, he decided against it.</p><p></p><p>If it were to cause another big commotion, it would make the people of Jianghai City nervous and imaginative again.</p><p></p><p>Moreover, this sword is forged from the material of pig iron, which is suitable for ordinary warriors. But since Ye Xiao's cultivation has already reached the level of a Grand Master, using it might cause the sword to be unable to withstand it and shatter directly. If that happens, it would be a loss.</p><p></p><p>It's better to wait until tomorrow to ask how much this sword can be sold for, recoup the initial investment, and then experiment with higher-grade materials.</p><p></p><p>After the forging was completed, Ye Xiao was about to go rest.</p><p></p><p>But at that moment, his phone lit up.</p><p></p><p>The caller ID showed Gu Hai's number.</p><p></p><p>"It's so late? Not cuddling your wife to sleep, why are you calling me?"</p><p></p><p>"Old Ye, something has happened. Your subordinate, Ning Yuheng, has been arrested."</p><p></p><p>Ye Xiao raised his eyebrows slightly.</p><p></p><p>"What did he do?"</p><p></p><p>"Causing trouble at the TV station."</p><p></p><p>Ye Xiao's brow furrowed deeper.</p><p></p><p>"That kid is quite refined, how could he cause trouble?"</p><p></p><p>"Not only him, but many others also participated in the commotion today, including Qin Yayan."</p><p></p><p>Ye Xiao was even more puzzled.</p><p></p><p>"What exactly happened? Explain clearly."</p><p></p><p>"Today, the TV station said they had invited two legendary swordsmen and knife masters. But the two people they arranged were quite flawed and arrogant. Qin Yayan, Ning Yuheng, and several others said they were fake, and the two sides started arguing. I heard they even came to blows in the end."</p><p></p><p>"Qin Yayan was also arrested?"</p><p></p><p>"No, she wasn't. Her grandfather is the dean of the Jianghai City Martial Arts Academy, so a phone call got her released. But Ning Yuheng and the other young people without any background were locked up.</p><p></p><p>And it might cause a bit of trouble.</p><p></p><p>This is not just a simple disturbance. I heard from my father-in-law that those two people were fake, arranged by someone surnamed Zhao, just to lure out the two masters.</p><p></p><p>But they were exposed by Ning Yuheng and the others, disrupting his plan. He probably won't let Ning Yuheng and the others off easily."</p><p></p><p>Ye Xiao rubbed his brow.</p><p></p><p>These power-hungry people are really not doing anything useful.</p><p></p><p>That Zhao guy, wanting to find him, must have some huge interests at stake.</p><p></p><p>In the eyes of outsiders, Ye Xiao is a knife master and a sword master, and may even be at the level of Grand Masters or above.</p><p></p><p>Such talents, if found and recruited to the Jiuzhou Alliance headquarters, would be a great political achievement that could lead to wealth and a carefree life in the next life! These people are really shameless in pursuit of their own interests.</p><p></p><p>"I see, you first help me find a separate cell for Ning Yuheng. With his pretty face, he might be in danger in prison. Also, make sure he eats and drinks well. The rest, we'll deal with it tomorrow."</p>

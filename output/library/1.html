        <h1>Chapter 1</h1>
        <div class="content">
            <p>Here is the full English translation of the Chinese excerpt:</p><p></p><p>The manager mechanically handed Ye Xiao an employee ID card, ushering him into the life of a working man.</p><p></p><p>Ye Xiao thanked him and turned to head towards the third floor, his thin silhouette making the manager shake his head slightly.</p><p></p><p>"What a pity, the young man is so handsome, but he hasn't awakened his spiritual soul, what a waste of that face."</p><p></p><p>Ye Xiao didn't hear the manager's words, as he was currently digesting the memories of this body.</p><p></p><p>Ten minutes ago, he had died from a serious illness on Earth, and in the blink of an eye, he had crossed over to this parallel world.</p><p></p><p>The civilization in this world is similar to Earth, the only difference being that this is a world of martial arts. </p><p></p><p>Due to the revival of spiritual martial arts, humans focus on cultivation, allowing them to extend their lifespan and even fly like the immortals in ancient novels, as long as they can awaken a thing called the spiritual soul.</p><p></p><p>Clearly, the Ye Xiao in this world had not awakened his spiritual soul, and could only cultivate some mediocre techniques, becoming a miserable working man.</p><p></p><p>How pitiful! But Ye Xiao soon came to terms with it.</p><p></p><p>Not being able to achieve great accomplishments in the martial arts path also means he won't face any major dangers.</p><p></p><p>The Ye Xiao from the previous life, tormented by illness, was extremely eager to live.</p><p></p><p>Living, more than anything else, was what mattered.</p><p></p><p>Moreover, the library provides room and board, a monthly salary of 3,500, and 24-hour air conditioning - isn't that wonderful? "Is this the A district already?"</p><p></p><p>Arriving at his work station, Ye Xiao was quite satisfied.</p><p></p><p>Every city has its own martial arts library, which meticulously records the cultivation techniques and martial arts experiences developed by many warriors, available for juniors to borrow.</p><p></p><p>The lower-level techniques are relatively poor in quality and can be borrowed freely. </p><p></p><p>The high-grade precious techniques, however, are guarded by powerful experts, and ordinary people cannot access them.</p><p></p><p>The area Ye Xiao managed was all basic techniques, with an abundance on the first and second floors, so he could enjoy a leisurely time.</p><p></p><p>But just then, a sudden sharp pain pierced his mind, and a book emitting a faint golden glow appeared.</p><p></p><p>Ye Xiao was startled, but through the memories of his previous self, he quickly understood what this was.</p><p></p><p>"I've awakened my spiritual soul?"</p><p></p><p>The awakening of his spiritual soul was quite timely.</p><p></p><p>But Ye Xiao did not get overly excited.</p><p></p><p>Having lived through a lifetime, he had long since become indifferent to everything.</p><p></p><p>He did not seek to cultivate to a high level, as long as he could protect himself.</p><p></p><p>In this world filled with powerful experts, he was no invincible overlord, and being high-profile would only invite trouble.</p><p></p><p>With nothing better to do, Ye Xiao decided to study the functions of his spiritual soul.</p><p></p><p>Communicating with his spiritual soul through his thoughts, he easily understood its abilities.</p><p></p><p>"By observing cultivation techniques, I can record them within my spiritual soul and cultivate them myself, without limit. Once a technique of the same origin is cultivated to great perfection, I can combine them to form a higher-grade technique, and continue cultivating it."</p><p></p><p>"Seems quite powerful."</p><p></p><p>Being able to cultivate on his own, only needing to read the book once, and then solving all subsequent problems, perfectly suited Ye Xiao's laidback personality.</p><p></p><p>As for the restriction of not being able to record the same origin techniques repeatedly, Ye Xiao understood the reason.</p><p></p><p>Many techniques are actually variants of the same fundamental technique, and some unscrupulous warriors would buy a technique and then adapt it into several versions, earning high royalties, just like the piracy and plagiarism in his previous life.</p><p></p><p>After understanding the functions of his spiritual soul, Ye Xiao immediately began searching the bookshelves to start reading cultivation techniques.</p><p></p><p>His reading ability was strong, and he could read books quickly. Moreover, cultivation techniques were not like regular books, with some only being a few pages long.</p><p></p><p>Here is my translation of the Chinese excerpt:</p><p></p><p>This morning, he looked at a full 25 cultivation manuals! Unfortunately, only 4 of the cultivation manuals were recorded into his spiritual sea - two sword arts, one blade art, and one fist manual.</p><p></p><p>The other 21 were all plagiarized.</p><p></p><p>And even those 4 books were plagiarized, with the Forbidden Tome just prioritizing recording the first version of the same-origin cultivation method, and then refining the core cultivation technique from it.</p><p></p><p>Ye Xiao couldn't help but feel a bit helpless - these people were just too shameless.</p><p></p><p>However, when he looked at the Forbidden Tome, there were 4 pages filled with cultivation techniques, and beneath each one was a visible cultivation progress bar rapidly rising. This lifted his mood considerably.</p><p></p><p>He could even feel his own cultivation base slowly starting to rise.</p><p></p><p>"Not bad, at this rate, I should be able to break through to a Second-Grade Martial Artist soon."</p><p></p><p>The cultivation realms of martial artists were divided into Innate and Acquired. The Acquired realms went from First to Ninth Grade, while the Innate realms were also divided from First to Ninth Grade. Those in the Acquired realms were simply called Martial Artists, but the Innate realms were further divided into Innate Masters, Grand Masters, and Divine Masters. It was said that even an Innate Master was already quite remarkable. In the city Ye Xiao was in, every graduating class from the Martial Arts Academy would have over 100,000 people, but out of those 100,000, only around 10 would manage to reach the Innate realms after cultivating for decades or even nearly a century. </p><p></p><p>So Innate Masters were truly one in a million.</p><p></p><p>Not to mention how much more difficult the higher Innate realms would be to cultivate.</p><p></p><p>Just then, the clock struck 12, and Ye Xiao stretched and finished his reading.</p><p></p><p>It was time for lunch.</p><p></p><p>The cafeteria food was actually not bad, since the library was a government-run institution and the meals were subsidized. A bowl of duck blood and vermicelli soup only cost 5 kuai, incredibly cheap!</p><p></p><p>Ye Xiao squinted and smiled.</p><p></p><p>"Looks like I'll be eating well from now on."</p><p></p><p>He ordered a lunch set and sat in the corner, slowly savoring it while discreetly eavesdropping on his colleagues' conversations, wanting to learn more about the situation around him.</p><p></p><p>At a table not far away, a few male colleagues were grumbling as they ate:</p><p></p><p>"Damn, the work at this library is not human. I got assigned to the logistics department, and I've been hauling books all morning, my back is killing me."</p><p></p><p>"You're lucky, at least you can sneak a smoke. I'm worse off, I'm on guard duty at the entrance, and I couldn't even take a piss break all morning."</p><p></p><p>"Ah, stop complaining you guys. It's not like we've awakened our spiritual seas, right? We've been cultivating for over a decade, and we're still only First-Grade Martial Artists. </p><p></p><p>We can only keep cultivating for a few more years, and see if we can break through to Second-Grade.</p><p></p><p>If we can break through to Second-Grade, we can join the military or a mercenary company. </p><p></p><p>Then we might have a chance to get a Condensed Spirit Pill and finally awaken our spiritual seas."</p><p></p><p>"You're dreaming. We've been cultivating for over a decade and are still stuck at First-Grade, who knows if we'll even make it to Second-Grade in this lifetime, let alone the higher realms. Just keep working a regular job, old man."</p><p></p><p>Ye Xiao sighed inwardly, it seemed the world of martial artists was even harder to make a name for oneself in than his previous life.</p><p></p><p>Looks like if he wanted to become a powerful expert, it would take him many years.</p><p></p><p>Oh well, as a waste like himself, he might as well just lie back and relax.</p><p></p><p>The moment this thought appeared, he suddenly felt a 'pop' in his body, and in an instant, Ye Xiao felt his power enter a new realm.</p><p></p><p>This caused his hand holding the chopsticks to pause.</p><p></p><p>Had he... broken through?</p>

        <h1>Chapter 235</h1>
        <div class="content">
            <p>Here is the full English translation of the Chinese excerpt:</p><p></p><p>When the complete version of the "Myriad Swords Converge" was detonated, how powerful was its might?</p><p></p><p>It can be said that in that moment, the explosion it triggered was a destructive power on a scale that could destroy the heavens and the earth.</p><p></p><p>The entire sky was completely disrupted by it, with the spiritual energy going into a chaotic frenzy, forming an impassable high-altitude zone between Ye Xiao and A Zuo in an instant.</p><p></p><p>Seizing this opportunity, he immediately unleashed his movement techniques and turned to flee.</p><p></p><p>Everyone was left in a state of bewilderment.</p><p></p><p>What is this situation? This guy actually chose to run away?</p><p></p><p>Where did his previous arrogance go? No more showing off?</p><p></p><p>Just earlier, he had directly slaughtered his subordinate Tree Demon because it wanted to flee.</p><p></p><p>But unexpectedly, he himself is now also running away with a bucket! Is he being so hypocritical?</p><p></p><p>However, the crowd soon began to worry.</p><p></p><p>Although Ye Xiao had stripped A Zuo of his pretentious facade, this did not change the fact that A Zuo was a top-tier powerhouse.</p><p></p><p>If Ye Xiao was in the Central Prefecture, they certainly wouldn't have to fear this guy. But if Ye Xiao was not around, who else could deal with A Zuo?</p><p></p><p>However, Ye Xiao himself showed no signs of panic.</p><p></p><p>Originally, he had wanted to play around with A Zuo a bit, since the latter was acting so arrogant.</p><p></p><p>But it turned out that A Zuo was not truly arrogant, he was just putting on an act! In that case, there was no need for Ye Xiao to continue playing.</p><p></p><p>At this time, the "Severing Heaven Sword" combined with the Imperial Extreme Sword Technique had already reached the fifty-ninth strike.</p><p></p><p>Ye Xiao extended his right hand and directly summoned the Great Dragon.</p><p></p><p>With the Great Dragon's appearance, the sword dao was amplified, greatly enhancing its power.</p><p></p><p>Furthermore, the sixtieth strike was empowered by the Imperial Extreme Sword Technique, making it much stronger than the previous ones.</p><p></p><p>The combination of the two allowed Ye Xiao's sword to instantly surpass the fifty-ninth strike by a huge level!</p><p></p><p>The sword beam directly cleaved through the chaotic spiritual energy turbulence in the sky, shooting out a distance of over a million meters. In the moment A Zuo tried to flee, it directly sliced him open, killing him instantly.</p><p></p><p>With a thunderous explosion, A Zuo's dragon body crashed heavily to the ground, declaring his death.</p><p></p><p>The entire world finally fell silent.</p><p></p><p>Everyone stared in dumbfounded amazement at this scene, their inner shock unable to subside for a long time.</p><p></p><p>He won? </p><p></p><p>He won just like that? Decisively and completely?</p><p></p><p>Just a moment ago, they all thought there was no way Ye Xiao could catch up to A Zuo, given the chaotic spiritual energy turbulence caused by the detonation of the "Myriad Swords Converge".</p><p></p><p>That terrifying spiritual energy turbulence was completely capable of tearing apart the physical body of a cultivator at the same level. There was no way Ye Xiao could possibly traverse through it.</p><p></p><p>Yet they never imagined that the next moment, Ye Xiao would simply use a single sword strike to dispel the extremely dangerous spiritual energy turbulence and directly slay A Zuo.</p><p></p><p>Doesn't that mean Ye Xiao hadn't even used his full strength before?</p><p></p><p>If he had, perhaps A Zuo wouldn't have even had the chance to unleash the "Myriad Swords Converge"? At this moment, everyone had come to worship Ye Xiao with the utmost reverence.</p><p></p><p>After the battle ended, Ye Xiao felt a little regretful.</p><p></p><p>He had wanted to try and see what the power would be like if the Imperial Extreme Sword Technique was fully combined with the "Severing Heaven Sword", unleashing all 108 sword beams.</p><p></p><p>But unfortunately, A Zuo had only managed to withstand up to the fifty-ninth strike before being one-shot by the sixtieth strike combined with the Great Dragon.</p><p></p><p>And with just the sixtieth strike, the remaining 48 strikes had not even been unleashed. If he could have executed the full 108 strikes, it should have been enough to surpass and severely injure even Monarch Realm experts, but without actual combat data, Ye Xiao didn't dare to confirm it rashly.</p><p></p><p>At this moment, Beitang Ce had flown up.</p><p></p><p>The look in his eyes towards Ye Xiao had lost the previous excitement, replaced by a deep sense of awe.</p><p></p><p>Although Ye Xiao was just a junior, and was even younger than Beitang Ce's great-grandson, being only about to turn 21 years old, in Beitang Ce's heart, Ye Xiao's greatness was beyond words.</p><p></p><p>In the world of cultivators, the strong dominate all! And the aura surrounding Ye Xiao was simply too dazzling.</p><p></p><p>He was a genius, an exceptional genius. But he was also a powerhouse, an exceptional powerhouse! Not every genius can become a powerhouse, for the path to becoming a powerhouse is filled with thorns, and no one can guarantee that a genius will not perish.</p><p></p><p>Similarly, a true powerhouse must possess the factors of a genius, be able to constantly grow stronger, and establish an undefeatable position, leaving others unable to even catch up.</p><p></p><p>Clearly, Ye Xiao was precisely this kind of person.</p><p></p><p>"Mr. Ye, thank you! Thank you for saving the Central Prefecture!" Beitang Ce deeply bowed to Ye Xiao, expressing his most sincere gratitude. Ye Xiao calmly nodded his head in response.</p><p></p><p>He did not show any significant change in mood just because Beitang Ce was thanking him.</p><p></p><p>After all, if the other party was a powerhouse and he was a weak one, the other party would also save the Central Prefecture.</p><p></p><p>Here is the full English translation of the Chinese excerpt:</p><p></p><p>There will always be someone who appears.</p><p></p><p>Secondly, this is not a difficult task for him. For a battle that he is absolutely certain to win, or to kill a few ants that can be easily crushed, who would get excited?</p><p></p><p>Obviously, no one would.</p><p></p><p>Except for those who are trying to show off.</p><p></p><p>"Mr. Ye, there is a small matter, I don't know if you can agree to it?"</p><p></p><p>"Go ahead and say it."</p><p></p><p>Ye Xiao's Taixuan Tiangong had long since swept over the admiring gazes of Shi Guanghao, Lang Xinyue and the others.</p><p></p><p>But he shook his head calmly.</p><p></p><p>"I won't see them."</p><p></p><p>Beitang Ce nodded, without further insistence.</p><p></p><p>He knew that a high-level person like Ye Xiao always spoke decisively, and if he angered him, the consequences would certainly not be good.</p><p></p><p>In fact, he had just come to ask on behalf of Lang Xinyue and the others.</p><p></p><p>Since Ye Xiao was unwilling to meet them, then they could only go back and lament.</p><p></p><p>"Other than you, there is no need for anyone else in the Central State City to know my identity."</p><p></p><p>"I respect Mr. Ye's decision."</p><p></p><p>However, although he did not meet those few people, Ye Xiao still raised his hand towards them in the distance and cast a healing spell to help them recover from their injuries.</p><p></p><p>Ye Xiao let Beitang Ce know his identity because he wanted to find a friend of a slightly higher status to help him gather some martial arts information.</p><p></p><p>He still did not like to expose himself in front of the crowd.</p><p></p><p>"Mr. Ye, you have worked hard, and I will take care of the rest. I have reported to the Nine States Alliance, and they should send down formation masters soon to repair the spirit gathering formation and the sealing formation, to ensure the supply of spiritual energy in the Central State City.</p><p></p><p>The city is well protected, and the facilities inside have not been damaged. After you return, you can live a normal life."</p><p></p><p>Ye Xiao glanced at the distant Azio Jashan and the poison dragon scorpion venerable that he had crushed into a meat patty, his gaze slightly moving.</p><p></p><p>These are such good dishes. It would be a pity not to try them.</p><p></p><p>Wrap the scorpion in breadcrumbs, deep fry it, crispy and crunchy, the neighbor's kids would cry with envy.</p><p></p><p>As for the sword dragon meat, he wanted to try it even more.</p><p></p><p>This is an unprecedented ingredient, and a semi-divine beast, with an unknown amount of vital energy contained within.</p><p></p><p>Thinking about this, he spoke:</p><p></p><p>"Since I've already lent a hand to help, I might as well do a good deed and help you repair the formations as well."</p><p></p><p>"You also know formations?"</p><p></p><p>Beitang Ce couldn't help but be somewhat surprised.</p><p></p><p>"A little bit."</p><p></p><p>Ye Xiao replied casually.</p><p></p><p>"Then I'm grateful for Mr. Ye's help."</p><p></p><p>Although Beitang Ce had not seen Ye Xiao use formations before, with so many of his abilities, knowing a bit of formations was also within reason.</p><p></p><p>Even if his formations were not good, if star beasts broke out later, he could make an excuse to let him help again to subdue the star beasts.</p><p></p><p>So letting him take action was also a good choice.</p><p></p><p>An hour later, Beitang Ce was deeply troubled as he looked at the formations in front of him.</p><p></p><p>"Mr. Ye, you just told me that you only know formations a little bit?"</p><p></p><p>Ye Xiao nodded.</p><p></p><p>"Yes, just a little bit."</p><p></p><p>Beitang Ce: "(灬')!"</p><p></p><p>He did not quite understand Ye Xiao's standard of "a little bit".</p><p></p><p>The level of his formation deployment seemed to be far higher than the top-tier formation masters of the Nine States Alliance. And this sealing formation, if he was not mistaken, should be an imperial formation! Moreover, Ye Xiao had completed it in just one hour.</p><p></p><p>If it were the top-level formation masters of the Nine States Alliance, even with several of them working together, they probably couldn't finish it in half a month, even if they worked through the night.</p><p></p><p>And this can still be called "a little bit"?</p><p></p><p>Then if he knew a bit more, how terrifying would that be? In the end, Beitang Ce could only sigh inwardly that Ye Xiao was on a completely different level from him, no, from the martial artists of this world.</p><p></p><p>After doing all this, Ye Xiao said:</p><p></p><p>"I'll go down and put these two star beasts inside, and use the healing spell to revive them. Living star beasts will have better spiritual energy absorption effects than dead ones."</p><p></p><p>Beitang Ce nodded.</p><p></p><p>"Then I'm grateful for Mr. Ye's help."</p><p></p><p>Ye Xiao nodded, taking Azio Jashan and the poison dragon scorpion venerable and jumping into the sealing formation.</p><p></p><p>After all, it took a lot of effort, so he should reap a little something to reward himself.</p><p></p><p>He used the Taixuan Tiangong to scan the star pearls of the two star beasts, and extracted the innate techniques from their bloodlines.</p><p></p><p>Luckily, the innate techniques in the star pearls of these two star beasts were both imperial techniques, and did not conflict with the other imperial techniques Ye Xiao currently possessed.</p><p></p><p>One was the Myriad Swords Returning to the Source that Azio Jashan had just used!</p><p></p><p>The other was the poison technique of the poison dragon scorpion venerable - the Devouring Spirit Demonic Incantation.</p>

        <h1>Chapter 8</h1>
        <div class="content">
            <p>Here is the full English translation of the Chinese excerpt:</p><p></p><p>Ye Xiao read book after book related to the heart method, until the end of his shift, finally finding a suitable classic - "The Wandering Dragon Returns to the Sea".</p><p></p><p>With this, he had collected three types of heart methods, but he still didn't know how many core heart methods he needed to gather and fuse to upgrade.</p><p></p><p>During this time, aside from picking up books, he hadn't moved at all.</p><p></p><p>And he had been facing away from the girl the entire time.</p><p></p><p>"Duang~!"</p><p></p><p>When the bell for the end of the workday rang, Ye Xiao closed the book, stretched, and stood up, walking towards the girl.</p><p></p><p>After becoming a master, anything happening within a radius of several meters, even if he didn't want to know, he would be fully aware of. So he knew that the girl had not left and was still searching for books related to swordsmanship.</p><p></p><p>"The library is closed, you can leave now."</p><p></p><p>The girl: "???"</p><p></p><p>She looked at Ye Xiao somewhat confusedly, but then glanced at the watch on her wrist and said apologetically, "I'm sorry. I'd like to borrow these few books to take home."</p><p></p><p>Ye Xiao stared at her fixedly. Was this girl's brain not working properly?</p><p></p><p>Not borrowing books earlier, not borrowing them later, but choosing this exact moment to do it.</p><p></p><p>Going through the whole procedure would take at least 10 minutes of overtime.</p><p></p><p>"The library has a rule that no techniques can be borrowed after closing. You can come back during work hours tomorrow."</p><p></p><p>The girl's brow furrowed slightly, seeming to sense Ye Xiao's displeasure, so she obediently put down the books and apologized softly.</p><p></p><p>"I'm sorry."</p><p></p><p>She then turned and left, leaving behind a faint jasmine fragrance.</p><p></p><p>Ye Xiao's mood improved significantly.</p><p></p><p>But it wasn't because of the fragrance on her, but because she had left, and he could finally go have his dinner.</p><p></p><p>However, just as he was about to leave, he noticed a student ID card lying under one of the books.</p><p></p><p>He pulled it out from the desk, the card case was a pale blue color, with the same jasmine scent as the girl, and a pretty, refined photo.</p><p></p><p>"Qin Yuyan, 4th year student in the Sword Dao Department of Jianghai Martial Arts University. Quite pretty, but her brain doesn't seem to work very well."</p><p></p><p>Shaking his head, Ye Xiao hurried to the cafeteria.</p><p></p><p>That night, he had originally wanted to order a roast duck, but it was too oily, so he ended up ordering a "chicken in the flower pot" with hand-pulled noodles instead.</p><p></p><p>As an animal lover, the good traditional ways were indispensable every meal.</p><p></p><p>There was a saying, how did it go again?</p><p></p><p>"If you love it, make it a part of yourself."</p><p></p><p>"I love you, and you love me."</p><p></p><p>Halfway through his meal, Ye Xiao's phone rang, it was Gu Hai calling.</p><p></p><p>"Hey, old Ye, are you free tonight?"</p><p></p><p>"If you've got something to say, just spit it out."</p><p></p><p>"Hehe, I got the student ID, but I have something to take care of, could you go to Jianghai Martial Arts University to pick it up?"</p><p></p><p>"Mm, hang up."</p><p></p><p>Ye Xiao simply agreed, and before hanging up, his keen hearing clearly detected the other's breathing becoming heavier.</p><p></p><p>That brat must be up to no good again.</p><p></p><p>After finishing dinner, Ye Xiao took the bus to the university, and received the two student IDs from a busty girl in a small strap top and super short skirt.</p><p></p><p>Although he was a master, he could run faster than the bus, but he preferred to experience more, since in the past when he was sick, he didn't have the chance to experience certain things.</p><p></p><p>And if others only knew he was a First-Grade Martial Artist who didn't even take the bus, wouldn't that be too suspicious?</p><p></p><p>Here is the full English translation of the Chinese excerpt:</p><p></p><p>"I didn't expect you to be so handsome. Are you interested in going for a drink tonight? I can have an iced one tonight."</p><p></p><p>Ye Xiao was rendered speechless. The speed of today's girls is faster than a public bus.</p><p></p><p>"Thank you, but I don't drink alcohol."</p><p></p><p>The polite refusal left the girl with the egg-shaped face a bit disappointed.</p><p></p><p>"Okay then, but if you want to come over and hang out in the future, my door is always open and I welcome you."</p><p></p><p>Ye Xiao cleared his throat, feeling a bit awkward as he turned and walked away, leaving the girl giggling behind him.</p><p></p><p>After turning the street corner, Ye Xiao finally let out a sigh of relief.</p><p></p><p>"It seems that although I have already reached the Grandmaster level, I still need to further improve my state of mind."</p><p></p><p>As soon as he said that, the large screen at the intersection switched to the local news channel of Jianghai City.</p><p></p><p>The dignified and graceful female news anchor spoke with a grave expression:</p><p></p><p>"We interrupt your regular programming to bring you an emergency news update. At 7:32 pm today, a riot broke out at the Jianghai City Prison, with a large number of Star Beasts escaping, including some at the Extraordinary level and even one at the Grandmaster level. Citizens are advised to avoid going out and take shelter at home or in their workplaces. The Jianghai Defense Force will apprehend these Star Beasts as soon as possible."</p><p></p><p>Ye Xiao's movements paused slightly.</p><p></p><p>So it really happened? </p><p></p><p>Earlier, he had vaguely sensed that the person he saw at the Defense Force this morning might be the Ferocious Leopard, and it turned out he was right.</p><p></p><p>But how come the Defense Force personnel didn't detect the other's identity? Doesn't the Defense Force have a Grandmaster-level expert, the Nangong?</p><p></p><p>And he had even anonymously warned them about it.</p><p></p><p>While pondering this, a commotion suddenly arose in the distance.</p><p></p><p>"Run, there's a Star Beast coming!"</p><p></p><p>Someone shouted, and the crowd started to panic, rushing to take shelter in the Jianghai Martial Arts Academy.</p><p></p><p>Ye Xiao glanced in the direction indicated.</p><p></p><p>On the street, several Defense Force members were surrounding and fighting a Spirit Cat. </p><p></p><p>The Spirit Cat was only half a meter tall, but its speed was at least 70 miles per hour, extremely swift. </p><p></p><p>What was more terrifying was its powerful attacks. Each strike on the Defense Force members caused them to be violently pushed back, their bodies visibly trembling.</p><p></p><p>"So this is a Star Beast?"</p><p></p><p>Although he was only observing the Spirit Cat from a distance, Ye Xiao couldn't help but marvel at the creator's wondrous design, allowing such a small creature to contend with humans much larger than itself, and even pose a potentially fatal threat if one wasn't careful.</p><p></p><p>However, in Ye Xiao's eyes, their movements were painfully slow.</p><p></p><p>From their actions, Ye Xiao could easily analyze that the Defense Force members would subdue the Spirit Cat with minor injuries within 20 moves.</p><p></p><p>As a Grandmaster-level expert, his martial arts experience had skyrocketed, and often he could predict the final outcome without needing to see the entire fight.</p><p></p><p>Therefore, he merely glanced at the scene and did not intervene.</p><p></p><p>"The classification of demonic beasts is: ordinary Star Beasts, Extraordinary Star Beasts, and Grandmaster Star Beasts. It's the same as the classification of cultivation techniques. Extraordinary Star Beasts are roughly equivalent to human martial artists at the 6th to 9th ranks, while Grandmaster Star Beasts are on par with Grandmaster-level experts.</p><p></p><p>However, the Star Beasts here are too weak, like little chicks. The Defense Force can easily handle them."</p><p></p><p>Shaking his head, Ye Xiao quickly headed towards the library.</p><p></p><p>Taking the bus was no longer an option, nor did he have the mood for it.</p><p></p><p>As he walked briskly, the scenery around him began to rapidly retreat.</p>

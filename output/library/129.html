        <h1>Chapter 129</h1>
        <div class="content">
            <p>Here is the full English translation of the Chinese excerpt:</p><p></p><p>It wasn't just Lingnan City, but also cities like Wanghai City and Jiangdong City around it that experienced similar incidents.</p><p></p><p>Each city was suddenly invaded by a massive number of star beasts, but they were mysteriously eliminated by sword lights in the blink of an eye.</p><p></p><p>It was a close call.</p><p></p><p>While the people were relieved to have survived the calamity, they couldn't help but speculate about the identity of the powerful expert who had intervened.</p><p></p><p>Many people associated it with the powerful figures in Jianghai City.</p><p></p><p>Suddenly, the local forums of various cities were flooded with posts about the mysterious expert from Wanghai City.</p><p></p><p>Although there had been similar posts before, since Ye Xiao had not displayed his power in other cities, the discussions were not as extensive or focused.</p><p></p><p>But this time, Ye Xiao had truly become a sensation.</p><p></p><p>"The mysterious expert has reappeared, suspected to be the reincarnation of a sword immortal."</p><p></p><p>"The expert's sword has arrived before they were even seen, eliminating 20,000 star beasts with a single thought. Seeking the cultivation data of this senior expert."</p><p></p><p>"Jianghai City says the senior expert is a Grand Master, but I think they're just making it up. The senior expert must be a powerful figure from the Divine Sect!"</p><p></p><p>Various posts were being enthusiastically discussed.</p><p></p><p>Some netizens from more distant cities couldn't help but envy the situation.</p><p></p><p>"I'm so envious! Our Chuzhou Chongshan City is in a terrible state, with star beasts roaming the streets. I'm too afraid to even go out."</p><p></p><p>"The message from Mount Peak City in the capital is filled with envy. I just had a finger bitten off by a star beast and have retreated to the rear hospital, but it's already full of patients."</p><p></p><p>"Why didn't the expert come to our city? Wah, it's so unfair! I strongly demand that the expert come to our city, and I can even offer them a monkey!"</p><p></p><p>Ye Xiao was naturally unaware of these events, as he was currently in the canyon, enjoying a hearty meal with Huan Liuli.</p><p></p><p>"To be honest, this old turtle's meat may be a bit lean, but it's not at all dry."</p><p></p><p>Huan Liuli enthusiastically nodded in agreement while humming, "Red-braised turtle is my favorite dish, sweet and spicy with a honey glaze. In a few days, Ai'er Wang should emerge, and then we can make red-braised stewed lamb, right?"</p><p></p><p>"Stewed lamb isn't good, grilled is the way to go."</p><p></p><p>"But isn't lamb soup delicious?"</p><p></p><p>"Lamb soup won't do, lamb soup is good in the cold winter. Now is the season for grilled meat and beer."</p><p></p><p>The master and pet, one human and one cat, finished the red-braised star beast turtle completely. Huan Liuli patted her round, full belly and couldn't even get up from the ground.</p><p></p><p>"Master, look at my belly, you've made it so big again!"</p><p></p><p>"Whose fault is it for eating so much?"</p><p></p><p>"It was just too delicious, I couldn't help myself, meow."</p><p></p><p>"Enough chatter, quickly collect all the star cores and flesh from these star beasts."</p><p></p><p>Ye Xiao gave Huan Liuli's butt a kick, and she hurriedly got up to work.</p><p></p><p>"As you command."</p><p></p><p>Now she no longer felt as resistant to serving Ye Xiao as a servant.</p><p></p><p>Star beasts may never be subjugated, but they can't resist being fed and housed by Ye Xiao.</p><p></p><p>This innate fifth-grade Black Xuanwu bloodline star beast, a Grand Master, was just stewed on a whim.</p><p></p><p>The taste, the culinary skills, the ingredients, this little obedient one thinks there's no one else like this under the heavens.</p><p></p><p>After eating the red-braised turtle, her cultivation, which was already approaching Sect Master third-grade, was now surging with vitality, and she estimated that she would break through the final barrier tonight.</p><p></p><p>Just thinking about it made her feel overjoyed.</p><p></p><p>She decided, for another hundred years, she would serve him as an eight-hundred-year servant. After eight hundred years, they'll see.</p><p></p><p>Huan Liuli quickly collected all the large and small star cores, as well as the freshly deceased star beasts, piling them into a small mountain in front of Ye Xiao.</p><p></p><p>Ye Xiao didn't hesitate, directly using the "Myriad Elements Convergence" technique to refine all the materials into a single medicinal pill.</p><p></p><p>If his expectations were correct, Ai'er Wang should be making his grand appearance soon.</p><p></p><p>Although he could fight beyond his level, it would still be better to raise his cultivation to the Divine Sect realm.</p><p></p><p>Cautious and secure.</p><p></p><p>Among the innate cultivations, only the three realms of Grand Master require comprehending the true essence of the Dao. After reaching the Divine Sect realm, one's thoughts and the true essence of the Dao would gradually mature, so as long as the cultivation was sufficient, and the mental breakthrough was achieved, it would be easy to advance to the Divine Sect realm.</p><p></p><p>There were originally over 140,000 star beasts here, with around 100,000 already dispatched, leaving less than 40,000 remaining. But among them were many Sect Masters, as well as a fifth-grade Black Xuanwu bloodline star core, which was innate fifth-grade.</p><p></p><p>Combined with the innate fifth-grade turtle he had just eaten, his inner qi and blood had accumulated significantly.</p><p></p><p>All of this together would be enough for him to attempt a breakthrough to the innate seventh-grade, the Divine Sect realm.</p><p></p><p>The "Myriad Elements Convergence" quickly refined the thousands of star cores and star beast corpses, extracting their essence and preparing for the fusion.</p><p></p><p>Normally, alchemists would refine a single star core or use a single star beast corpse to create a medicinal pill.</p><p></p><p>Otherwise, if two or more different star cores or star beast flesh were used, the conflicting properties of the energies within could cause an explosion, which would be extremely dangerous and even life-threatening.</p><p></p><p>But the "Myriad Elements Convergence" was a supreme-level alchemy technique, so Ye Xiao could boldly and easily fuse different types of star cores and star beasts together without worry.</p><p></p><p>Here is the full English translation of the Chinese novel excerpt:</p><p></p><p>However, because the quantity was truly too many, it took Ye Xiao a full three hours to completely fuse all the star cores together, which was truly not an easy task.</p><p></p><p>Soon, Ye Xiao had refined a round and smooth medicinal pill.</p><p></p><p>Because the contained energy was so abundant, its size was far beyond that of a normal medicinal pill, being as large as a chicken egg.</p><p></p><p>It emanated a rich golden color, permeated with an alluring fragrance that made one's mouth water.</p><p></p><p>"Gulp."</p><p></p><p>Huan Liuli couldn't help but swallow hard.</p><p></p><p>So big!</p><p></p><p>She swore she had never seen such a large medicinal pill in her life! This medicinal pill, although not yet reaching the level of an Emperor Pill, was sufficient to reach the level of a Half-Step Emperor Pill.</p><p></p><p>If she were to consume it, the energy contained within would likely allow her to directly break through the final barrier of the Innate Third Grade, and after fully digesting it, she might even be able to continue breaking through to the Innate Fourth Grade, becoming a Grand Master.</p><p></p><p>But alas, she could only look on, for the next moment, Ye Xiao directly swallowed it down.</p><p></p><p>Crunch, crunch.</p><p></p><p>Huan Liuli's mouth watered with envy.</p><p></p><p>"Master, what does it taste like?"</p><p></p><p>"It's a bit like a seven-eighths done tender steak, fresh and juicy, not greasy at all."</p><p></p><p>Huan Liuli envied him even more.</p><p></p><p>After consuming the medicinal pill, Ye Xiao immediately felt a mighty surge of energy rushing down his throat and into his viscera.</p><p></p><p>The power was too strong, too dense! After all, it was the combined star cores of over 40,000 star beasts, their power exceeding common imagination.</p><p></p><p>Ye Xiao once again felt his body begin to violently boil.</p><p></p><p>And this time, it was several times stronger than the last! For the previous refinement, he only had the Black Scale Snake, a Innate Fourth Grade corpse, and the Star Pearl. But this time, it was over 40,000 star beasts, including not a few Masters and Grand Masters.</p><p></p><p>However, Ye Xiao was not certain that he would be able to smoothly break through.</p><p></p><p>Although the previous medicinal pill was small, at that time he had already cultivated for several months, and his body had already absorbed a fair amount of spiritual energy.</p><p></p><p>But now, he had just broken through to the Innate Sixth Grade, and it had only been a couple of months. Furthermore, the higher the cultivation, the more spiritual energy is required for breakthroughs, so he could not be 100% sure of breaking through to the Divine Ancestor Realm.</p><p></p><p>As the spiritual energy surged within him, various cultivation techniques automatically activated, circulating through his meridians to suppress the rampaging spiritual energy and cleanse Ye Xiao's dantian and meridians.</p><p></p><p>The Tyrannical Blade, Severing the Heavens Sword, Divine Will Incantation, Purple Vortex Star Sea, Indestructible Divine Skill, Replenishing the Heavens Art, Stellar Incantation, Divine Craftsmanship, and even the mental cultivation technique Mysterious Heaven Astral, all began to operate together to digest the spiritual power within the medicinal pill.</p><p></p><p>This portion of spiritual power came from the star cores of the star beasts.</p><p></p><p>Only the two formations did not activate, as they were external auxiliary techniques beyond the scope of his own cultivation.</p><p></p><p>Under the suppression of these powerful cultivation techniques, the originally rampant spiritual energy gradually became docile, circulating through the meridians according to a set path.</p><p></p><p>However, even so, Ye Xiao's meridians could not withstand the sudden explosive surge of massive spiritual energy.</p><p></p><p>For it was simply too much!</p><p></p><p>They could obediently follow the path guided by the cultivation techniques, but could not slow down their speed, or they would directly explode on the spot.</p><p></p><p>This made Ye Xiao sigh, "Consuming pills has its risks, one must be cautious before partaking."</p><p></p><p>Fortunately, his Replenishing the Heavens Art and Stellar Incantation continuously activated, repairing his shattered meridians, while the Indestructible Divine Skill operated, making his meridians as hard as steel.</p><p></p><p>In this way, even if the spiritual energy raged, it could not harm Ye Xiao, only allowing his cultivation to soar like a rocket.</p><p></p><p>As his cultivation rose, Ye Xiao's self-confidence grew stronger.</p><p></p><p>Aer King, wait for me! At the same time, deep underground beneath several cities, a sinister laughter continuously echoed.</p><p></p><p>"Blood, the scent of blood! I can already smell it, hehe hehe.</p><p></p><p>So much fresh blood, with so much pure energy, how can this damned seal stop me?"</p><p></p><p>He immediately began to frantically absorb the blood seeping into the ground.</p><p></p><p>He felt his inner power continuously increasing, the power that had been dried up for so many years due to the seal, now returning like a withered tree coming back to life.</p><p></p><p>The return of his power also revived his ambitions, a thick aura of murderous intent spreading unceasingly.</p><p></p><p>"Humans! Fifty-six years of the agony of being sealed, this time I will repay it all to you!</p><p></p><p>I will make you regret what you did back then! Let you know that the gods are inviolable!</p><p></p><p>And that little brat from the library, you wait for me.</p><p></p><p>I will definitely cut you into slices, like eating sashimi, no seasoning, just pure and natural, slice by slice."</p><p></p><p>Fifth update, 15,000 words.</p><p></p><p>I'm still typing, and there will be more later, but I have to go to work, so I couldn't save out that much at once.</p><p></p><p>But I will continue to type diligently, please understand.</p><p></p><p>The chapters are all 3,000 words long, equivalent to one and a half chapters of other authors.</p><p></p><p>(This chapter is complete)</p>

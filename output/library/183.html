        <h1>Chapter 183</h1>
        <div class="content">
            <p>Here is the full English translation of the Chinese excerpt:</p><p></p><p>In Qinzhou, there were countless powerful martial artists with a rich historical legacy, shining like countless stars, leaving a brilliant mark in the long history of martial arts across the Nine Provinces.</p><p></p><p>Ancestor Dragon established his base in Qinzhou, unifying the mountains and rivers, and reshaping the Divine Land!</p><p></p><p>Within Qinzhou, there were many treacherous mountains and rivers, and the Tianhuo Cliff was one of them.</p><p></p><p>It was rumored that the Tianhuo Cliff was a forbidden land for the human race. </p><p></p><p>Those whose cultivation did not reach the Divine Ancestor realm had no qualifications to come to this place, and even if one's cultivation reached the Divine Ancestor realm, they still had to be extremely careful here. </p><p></p><p>Because if one was not careful enough, even a Divine Ancestor could perish here.</p><p></p><p>From afar, the Tianhuo Cliff was shrouded in layers of white mist, resembling a sea of clouds, making it impossible to see what was below.</p><p></p><p>Before long, a small figure flew over from the distance, gradually growing larger as it approached.</p><p></p><p>Upon reaching the Tianhuo Cliff, it was revealed to be a powerfully built man, but his emerald green eyes indicated that he was a half-beast, not a pure human.</p><p></p><p>He quickly arrived at the edge of the Tianhuo Cliff and knelt down, shouting loudly:</p><p></p><p>"Yue Yu, the Three Flag Master of the Beast God Alliance's main headquarters, pays respects to the Elder Alliance Master, and begs the Elder Alliance Master to emerge from seclusion to uphold justice for our Beast God Alliance."</p><p></p><p>Moments later, the sea of clouds began to churn, as if controlled by a powerful spiritual force.</p><p></p><p>Gradually, a figure in a black robe emerged from the clouds, coming before the man.</p><p></p><p>The overwhelming pressure emanating from the figure caused Yue Yu to struggle to even lift his head.</p><p></p><p>The pressure was too strong. Although Yue Yu was a Sixth-Grade Innate Grand Master, he was utterly overwhelmed in the presence of the Alliance Master.</p><p></p><p>Truly, this was the mightiest Alliance Master in the history of the Beast God Alliance. Three hundred years ago, he had emerged from a small mountain village, a weak and abandoned half-beast.</p><p></p><p>No one could have imagined that this half-beast, after countless battles and near-death experiences, would eventually become the Alliance Master.</p><p></p><p>From then on, his mark was left upon the entire era.</p><p></p><p>He withstood the Nine Provinces Alliance, battling against the 35th-ranked Jiang Lingyu on the World Dragon Ranking!</p><p></p><p>He won! To save his beloved, he forcefully breached the Qinzhou Heavenly Gate, fighting against the 41st-ranked Xun Qingwu on the World Phoenix Ranking!</p><p></p><p>He won! With his own power, he changed the human race's perception of the half-beasts, letting them know that a powerful half-beast was not to be trifled with.</p><p></p><p>During his time as the Beast God Alliance's Master, it was the alliance's most glorious era.</p><p></p><p>Many powerful experts from various places did not dare to directly confront the Beast God Alliance, and would automatically surrender upon encountering them. </p><p></p><p>Almost no one dared to oppose the Beast God Alliance.</p><p></p><p>At that time, the Beast God Alliance was nothing like the stray dogs they were today, hiding and fleeing.</p><p></p><p>If it were not for the fact that he was eventually defeated and forced into seclusion at the Tianhuo Cliff by the 9th-ranked Jiuzhou Sword Deity Li Liushui, he would still be the Alliance Master even now.</p><p></p><p>Yue Yu struggled to lift his head and look at the emaciated man before him, his eyes reddening and becoming slightly moist.</p><p></p><p>To the entire Beast God Alliance, he was their Beast God! "Your subordinate pays respects to the Elder Alliance Master. Wuwuwu..."</p><p></p><p>"Do not cry, this lord is not yet dead."</p><p></p><p>"Yes!"</p><p></p><p>Yue Yu immediately wiped the tears from his eyes.</p><p></p><p>"Elder Alliance Master, please emerge from seclusion and represent our Beast God Alliance. The human race has destroyed our Beast God Alliance, and an unknown young man has annihilated the entire Beast God Alliance."</p><p></p><p>The Elder Alliance Master raised his brow slightly and asked, "Where is the new Alliance Master?"</p><p></p><p>"In response to the Elder Alliance Master, the new Alliance Master has already been suppressed and killed on the spot!"</p><p></p><p>"If I'm not mistaken, the cultivation of the new Alliance Master should be at least Eighth-Grade Innate, which is quite high within the Beast God Alliance. How could he have been so easily suppressed?"</p><p></p><p>"In response to the Elder Alliance Master, we also do not know the exact cultivation of the opponent, but it seems to be at the Eighth-Grade Innate level as well.</p><p></p><p>Moreover, the opponent used the Tathagata Palm, the most rigid and yang-dominant palm technique of the Shaolin School."</p><p></p><p>"The Tathagata Palm? Could the opponent be from the Buddhist sect?"</p><p></p><p>"No, the opponent is a warrior we have never seen before. And we still do not know who he is."</p><p></p><p>"Do not worry. Bring me the flesh and blood of the Nalan Fire Fox."</p><p></p><p>"Yes!"</p><p></p><p>Yue Yu quickly produced a small piece of the Nalan Fire Fox's flesh, which he had secretly taken from the flattened body, just in case it was needed.</p><p></p><p>The Elder Alliance Master placed the Nalan Fire Fox's flesh in his palm and activated his cultivation technique. In the next moment, the flesh transformed into a blood mist, slowly forming three large characters in the air:</p><p></p><p>"Jianghai City!"</p><p></p><p>"The one who killed the Nalan Fire Fox is in Jianghai City. Is there any exceptionally powerful existence in Jianghai City?"</p><p></p><p>Yue Yu's expression changed slightly.</p><p></p><p>"In response to the Elder Alliance Master, Jianghai City recently has a Sword and Saber Immortal who has defeated the 49th-ranked Hanzhou Sword Saint Liu Chengxun and the 50th-ranked Iga Ninja Master Murasame Hitsugi.</p><p></p><p>However, the martial art he cultivates should be sword and saber techniques, while the Nalan Alliance Master was killed using the Tathagata Palm from the Buddhist sect."</p><p></p><p>"Who knows? Perhaps this is precisely his terrifying aspect."</p><p></p><p>A pause.</p><p></p><p>Here is the full English translation of the Chinese excerpt:</p><p></p><p>Suddenly, his expression suddenly hardened.</p><p></p><p>"Issue the order, gather all the branches of the Beast God Alliance. In one month, this Patriarch will personally go to Jianghai City."</p><p></p><p>"Yes!"</p><p></p><p>Yue Yu's excited heartbeat started to accelerate.</p><p></p><p>He's going to make a move!</p><p></p><p>The old Patriarch is going to make a move. When the old Patriarch makes a move, the great enmity of Patriarch Nalan will surely be avenged.</p><p></p><p>Moreover, with the old Patriarch's strength, the Beast God Alliance will certainly receive higher-level protection.</p><p></p><p>This time, they must let the human race know the consequences of offending the Beast God Alliance.</p><p></p><p>As for Jianghai City, Ye Xiao was not yet aware of this matter.</p><p></p><p>However, even if he knew, he would still destroy Nalan Huohu.</p><p></p><p>The Beast God Alliance has been too excessive, causing so many human beings to suffer. If Ye Xiao does not kill Nalan Huohu, the Beast God Alliance may commit even more atrocities. Moreover, the left protector of the Beast God Alliance has already been killed.</p><p></p><p>Even if he doesn't go looking for trouble with Nalan Huohu, Nalan Huohu will surely come looking for trouble with him.</p><p></p><p>Not killing and keeping him for the New Year?</p><p></p><p>At this time, he began to prepare for his grand forging plan.</p><p></p><p>The Dragon Soul has already agreed to be his spirit vessel, and he cannot waste such a good opportunity.</p><p></p><p>When he occupied the Beast God Alliance, he had already obtained a huge amount of materials.</p><p></p><p>However, among these materials, there was still a lack of some key materials.</p><p></p><p>This key material is not a particularly precious thing, but just a common material - Blood Red Sand, which is a semi-medicinal material and is sometimes used to treat injured souls.</p><p></p><p>It is both a material and can nourish the soul. Many officials and nobles use it to fill their tombs after death.</p><p></p><p>Ye Xiao needs to use this material, fuse it into the Sword of Tang, and provide a nourishing environment for the Dragon Soul.</p><p></p><p>Although it can be done without this, the quality of the Dragon Soul will be fixed.</p><p></p><p>Since he's going to do it, he might as well do it well.</p><p></p><p>He quickly came to Old Man Xu's auction house.</p><p></p><p>Old Man Xu was sunbathing on a lounge chair at the entrance, relaxing to the extreme.</p><p></p><p>"Old Man Xu, could you please prepare some Blood Red Sand for me?"</p><p></p><p>Old Man Xu glanced at him and waved his hand, calling out to the inside:</p><p></p><p>"Big Cat, go get some Blood Red Sand for Ye Xiao."</p><p></p><p>Big Cat Cat responded and immediately went upstairs.</p><p></p><p>Old Man Xu then spoke again:</p><p></p><p>"Ye Xiao, why haven't you been forging lately?"</p><p></p><p>"I've been too busy recently, and haven't had much time for forging."</p><p></p><p>Old Man Xu smacked his lips.</p><p></p><p>"Hey, I'm two generations older than you, so you can call me Uncle, right? I have a few words I have to say to you.</p><p></p><p>You're good in every way, but your temperament is too laidback, always not fighting or competing, which won't do at all.</p><p></p><p>You probably haven't realized how powerful the forging profession is.</p><p></p><p>Let me tell you, the other day I went to Hu City and watched the Nine Provinces Forging Competition.</p><p></p><p>Wow, the scene was grand, with crowds lining the streets! Among them, there was a forging grandmaster who even forged a legendary Sub-Emperor Weapon.</p><p></p><p>Do you know what a Sub-Emperor Weapon is?</p><p></p><p>Never mind, you probably don't know. Just know that it's a weapon you'll never be able to forge in your lifetime.</p><p></p><p>Wow, that grandmaster became famous with that one feat. Now the entire Nine Provinces are looking for him, all wanting him to forge weapons for them.</p><p></p><p>If you work hard as a forger, even if you can't reach that level, you'll still be a hundred times better than being a library manager."</p><p></p><p>Ye Xiao: "(￣.￣)!"</p><p></p><p>"I think working at the library is pretty good, warm in winter, cool in summer, over 10,000 a month, and lots of employee benefits."</p><p></p><p>"Forget it, you're just a piece of mud that can't be molded. I'm wasting my breath."</p><p></p><p>Old Man Xu shook his head, his eyes full of disappointment towards Ye Xiao, clearly regretting not being able to become Ye Xiao's life mentor.</p><p></p><p>He soon immersed himself in imagining that forging grandmaster again.</p><p></p><p>"I wonder what that forging grandmaster looks like? If he was from Jianghai City, I'd marry off my Big Cat to him."</p><p></p><p>Ye Xiao: "(￣.￣)+!"</p><p></p><p>Faced with such a terrible idea, he was glad he had hidden his identity, otherwise he might have to run away in the middle of the night.</p><p></p><p>Soon, Big Cat came over carrying a bag of Blood Red Sand. That bag of Blood Red Sand, a normal person would have to carry it on their shoulder, but Big Cat just used one hand to lift it up, with the feeling of a big bear picking up a little chick.</p><p></p><p>"Here, this stuff is cheap, our store sells it by the 10 pounds minimum."</p><p></p><p>"Okay, how much?"</p><p></p><p>"1,600 in total. 200 per pound."</p><p></p><p>Ye Xiao paid the money, took the Blood Red Sand, shouldered it, bid farewell to the father-daughter pair, and left.</p><p></p><p>Turning the corner, he stored the Blood Red Sand in his spatial ring.</p><p></p><p>Then he quickly left Jianghai City and came to a large mountain outside the city.</p><p></p><p>Forging such a powerful weapon might cause heavenly phenomena, so Ye Xiao wanted to be cautious and stay away from the city.</p><p></p><p>This is the second update, 6,000 words.</p><p></p><p>Please recommend, vote for monthly tickets, and subscribe! </p><p></p><p>Thank you to book friend 20180115103001425 for the reward, greatly appreciated.</p><p></p><p>(This chapter is complete)</p>

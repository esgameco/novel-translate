        <h1>Chapter 408</h1>
        <div class="content">
            <p>Here is the full English translation of the Chinese excerpt:</p><p></p><p>In the darkness, an alluring wind drew near, bringing a fragrant scent.</p><p></p><p>But Ye Xiao's keen sense of smell clearly detected a hint of bloodiness amidst the fragrance.</p><p></p><p>"Little brother, we two are lost. Can you lead us out of here? Help us find the way back home?"</p><p></p><p>Ye Xiao remained silent as the two women approached coyly.</p><p></p><p>"Little brother, please. If you can help us find our way home, we'll agree to any request you have."</p><p></p><p>One of the women slightly tugged at her collar.</p><p></p><p>Round and jade-like, flawless as white jade, towering high, unfathomable - Pei Qi and Bao Li passed away peacefully.</p><p></p><p>Ye Xiao did not utter a word, unleashing the Annihilation Treasure Art, directly sending the two of them away.</p><p></p><p>The application of the Annihilation Treasure Art is diverse.</p><p></p><p>It can be attached to other attacks, or it can form sword beams or blade beams as attacks on its own.</p><p></p><p>The two women were beheaded by Ye Xiao's single sword strike.</p><p></p><p>Even several seconds after their deaths, the two women still could not figure out what had happened. Had they been discovered by Ye Xiao? </p><p></p><p>But how did Ye Xiao discover them?</p><p></p><p>Although they had not yet fully recovered their peak cultivation, they were at least existences at the Divine Realm First Layer.</p><p></p><p>In this world, is it not that the vast majority of people are trash, and only a few exceptional existences possess strong strength?</p><p></p><p>Plop plop. The two heads fell to the ground, their eyes wide open in puzzlement.</p><p></p><p>"It seems there are demonic beings at work here, but this doesn't seem to be a zombie - the texture looks too soft, zombies shouldn't be like this.</p><p></p><p>It should be a cultivation of some ancient divine art that focuses on blood-drinking and soul-devouring."</p><p></p><p>Ye Xiao opened his Elemental Eyes and scanned their bodies, surprisingly finding that parts of their bodies had already petrified.</p><p></p><p>This indicated that their bodies had existed for an extremely long time.</p><p></p><p>"The colleagues at the library seemed to have discussed that the Ning family had obtained quite a few obsidian coffins. Could it be that they are existences from the ancient times?"</p><p></p><p>Ye Xiao pondered for a moment, then his eyes lit up.</p><p></p><p>"If I scan their memories, won't I be able to know a lot of things?"</p><p></p><p>Putting thought into action, he immediately unleashed the Immortality Treasure Art, reviving the two women.</p><p></p><p>Pei Qi and Bao Li looked at Ye Xiao with a dazed expression, completely at a loss.</p><p></p><p>What was this situation? Weren't they just killed? How did they suddenly revive?</p><p></p><p>Were they dreaming?</p><p></p><p>But before they could react, the next moment, they felt their souls being invaded by an extremely powerful energy.</p><p></p><p>"Damn it! He's searching our memories, we can't let him succeed."</p><p></p><p>Although the two women wanted to live, they were not fools. Today, facing a powerhouse like Ye Xiao, they had no chance of escaping. But if they let Ye Xiao obtain their memories, their entire group's plan of resurrection might be completely ruined.</p><p></p><p>So the two of them absolutely could not let Ye Xiao acquire their memories.</p><p></p><p>Self-destruct!</p><p></p><p>The two attempted to self-destruct their divine souls.</p><p></p><p>However, the next moment, they despairingly discovered that they had already lost control of their bodies, and even their souls were beyond their control, only able to let Ye Xiao search their souls.</p><p></p><p>A deep sense of despair and shock sank into the hearts of the two women.</p><p></p><p>How terrifying is this person? In the present world, the martial arts culture has long since lost its former prosperity of the ancient times.</p><p></p><p>This Canglan Star Domain has already become a gathering place for the weak, with no super powerhouses at all.</p><p></p><p>But where did this freak come from?</p><p></p><p>Just as the two were still wondering where Ye Xiao came from, Ye Xiao had already finished searching their memories.</p><p></p><p>With a flash of light, the Annihilation Treasure Art was unleashed again, and the two heads fell to the ground once more.</p><p></p><p>At this moment, the hearts of the two women collapsed to the extreme.</p><p></p><p>You don't have to bully us like this.</p><p></p><p>After just searching their memories, he immediately struck and killed them again, this is simply unforgivable.</p><p></p><p>Even if you don't want to pay, you could at least let us catch our breath, right? The speed of killing is even faster than the speed of searching memories, not treating them as human beings at all.</p><p></p><p>After slaying the two, Ye Xiao casually disposed of their bodies.</p><p></p><p>Then, instead of continuing towards home, he turned and headed back towards the center of the Jiang Hai City.</p><p></p><p>Through a sleepless night, as the moonlight reached the latter half of the night, several figures gradually returned to the small alley.</p><p></p><p>"Ah, Food-Heart Demon, your strength has actually reached the Divine Realm Second Layer, you've progressed so quickly!"</p><p></p><p>"Hehe, I've been quite lucky. I encountered two Ancestral Realm powerhouses! It just so happened to help me break through that last bit of cultivation.</p><p></p><p>I estimate it won't be long before my cultivation can rise to the Divine Realm Third Layer."</p><p></p><p>"I'm so envious of you, my luck today wasn't as good. I encountered a few big idiots, their strength wasn't strong, but they were especially good at causing trouble, almost exposing my existence.</p><p></p><p>Luckily, my brain is quite agile, and I was quick-handed. Otherwise, just now..."</p><p></p><p>Here is my translation of the Chinese excerpt:</p><p></p><p>"Children, you all probably can't find me anymore."</p><p></p><p>"It seems like everyone's gains tonight have been quite good. We need to keep up the hard work and strive to quickly restore our cultivation to the level of Deicide Realm existences!"</p><p></p><p>The crowd solemnly nodded their heads. But just at this moment, someone couldn't help but open their mouth in puzzlement:</p><p></p><p>"Strange, it's been so long, how come we still haven't seen Peiqi and Baoli? Why are they taking so long to come back?"</p><p></p><p>"Could it be that they've been targeted by the Xuanyuan Clan?"</p><p></p><p>"It shouldn't be that serious. Their strengths are both very powerful. If the other side had targeted them, they wouldn't be able to instantly kill them.</p><p></p><p>They must have found a way to transmit a message to us. </p><p></p><p>Even if they didn't transmit a message, as Godly Realm experts, the commotion from their battle wouldn't be small. But we haven't heard any disturbances.</p><p></p><p>Perhaps they've been delayed by other matters."</p><p></p><p>"That's true. Baoli and Peiqi were once top elite special agents under Alpha King's command, known as the 'Twin Viper Assassins', and were extremely trusted by Alpha King himself.</p><p></p><p>Although their strengths aren't at their peak now, they still shouldn't be easily taken down by these people."</p><p></p><p>"Who knows, maybe the two of them went to have some fun. After all, that was their line of work back in the ancient times, hehe."</p><p></p><p>Amid the teasing, a figure silently approached the area. At first, the crowd didn't notice, until the figure entered the alley, when they suddenly discovered him.</p><p></p><p>It was a figure wearing a cloak and hat - Ye Xiao!</p><p></p><p>"Who are you?" </p><p></p><p>The crowd asked with a hint of killing intent.</p><p></p><p>Ye Xiao replied calmly, "The one who will kill you."</p><p></p><p>"How arrogant! You're courting death!" </p><p></p><p>As they spoke, the Devouring Heart Demon rushed forward first.</p><p></p><p>"Devouring Heart Demon, don't be rash. You're not his match."</p><p></p><p>But the speed of the Godly Realm was mind-numbingly fast, faster than lightning. </p><p></p><p>Before he could even finish speaking, the Devouring Heart Demon had already charged in front of Ye Xiao.</p><p></p><p>Boom! With a thunderous explosion, the battle was decided in an instant.</p><p></p><p>The Devouring Heart Demon was instantly killed by Ye Xiao!</p><p></p><p>The punch pierced through his heart, completely crushing it to powder, not even giving him a chance to react.</p><p></p><p>His speed was already fast enough, but it was still no match for the speed of his own death.</p><p></p><p>This scene immediately caused everyone's pupils to constrict, their hairs to stand on end, and a chill to run from the soles of their feet to the tops of their heads!</p><p></p><p>"Damn it! So strong!"</p><p></p><p>"Retreat!"</p><p></p><p>"Scatter and flee, don't let him catch you."</p><p></p><p>As they spoke, several figures dispersed, shooting off in different directions like beams of light. Their speeds were all very fast, and in the blink of an eye, they had already left Jianghai City.</p><p></p><p>Since they had scattered so widely, even if others tried to pursue, they would at most only be able to catch one of them.</p><p></p><p>Those who had already escaped far away all couldn't help but look back at Ye Xiao, seeing that he still hadn't moved from his spot, and couldn't help but smile at the corners of their mouths.</p><p></p><p>They had succeeded, Ye Xiao still hadn't caught up to them, and he no longer had a chance to do so.</p><p></p><p>They had escaped successfully!</p><p></p><p>But unfortunately, just in the next moment, when their smiles were at their brightest, Ye Xiao finally made his move.</p><p></p><p>Activating his Heavenly Artifact Art, in an instant, those who had already completely escaped were all brought back to the original point, as if they had been teleported back.</p><p></p><p>"What? What's going on?"</p><p></p><p>The expressions on the crowd's faces instantly froze, soon replaced by expressions of terror! This sudden change of events frightened them to the core.</p><p></p><p>"Artifact Art! It's Artifact Art! There's no other power that can do this. He actually has Artifact Art! My god!"</p><p></p><p>One of them had already discovered Ye Xiao's secret.</p><p></p><p>However, Ye Xiao didn't say a word, his face expressionless, and in the next moment, he directly activated his power to forcibly search the memories of the few people.</p><p></p><p>"He's searching our memories! He wants to search our memories! We absolutely can't let him succeed, or our secrets will be exposed."</p><p></p><p>Unfortunately, although the crowd had sensed this, they had no way to resist Ye Xiao's spiritual scanning.</p><p></p><p>Not to mention Ye Xiao's spiritual power cultivation was the Nine Star Divine Art, they were currently only at the Godly Realm!</p><p></p><p>The gap in cultivation, was a chasm they could not easily bridge.</p><p></p><p>"Damn it!! Self-destruct! Self-destruct so he can't benefit from us!"</p><p></p><p>The leading figure frantically shouted, wanting to lead his subordinates to complete their mission.</p><p></p><p>But at this moment, one of his subordinates next to him sighed:</p><p></p><p>"Stop struggling, I've already tried, our souls have all been sealed, we can't even activate our spiritual powers."</p>

        <h1>Chapter 61</h1>
        <div class="content">
            <p>Here is the full English translation of the Chinese excerpt:</p><p></p><p>Ye Xiao returned home and immediately began to cultivate the healing cultivation technique.</p><p></p><p>The doors and windows of the room were all closed to ensure that the golden light would not leak out during the process of refining the healing cultivation technique.</p><p></p><p>It took a full half an hour, and ten sheets of paper imprinted with the basic healing cultivation technique were combined into one.</p><p></p><p>The Mending the Heavens Technique! This was the name of the refined cultivation technique.</p><p></p><p>It was very much in line with Ye Xiao's intentions.</p><p></p><p>It was filled with a strong sense of arrogance and middle-schooler-like style! "The Mending the Heavens Technique, does it mean that it can even heal the holes in the sky?"</p><p></p><p>The divine book's divine soul had already begun to cultivate on its own.</p><p></p><p>By the next morning, just as dawn was breaking, the cultivation was finally complete.</p><p></p><p>At this point, Ye Xiao was able to perfectly execute the Mending the Heavens Technique.</p><p></p><p>He immediately grabbed an ant from the courtyard to test it.</p><p></p><p>First, he used sword qi to cut the ant in half at the waist, then tore off its eight legs one by one, and finally broke off its antennae. At this point, all the ant's organs were motionless.</p><p></p><p>Executing the Mending the Heavens Technique, a golden light beam formed and instantly enveloped the ant's severed limbs and arms.</p><p></p><p>When he first saw the name, Ye Xiao felt that this cultivation technique was powerful, but he didn't expect that when executed, it would emanate a golden light.</p><p></p><p>It's worth noting that Ye Xiao had seen many healing cultivation techniques, all of which were white in color.</p><p></p><p>This shows the extraordinary nature of the Mending the Heavens Technique.</p><p></p><p>The golden light poured over the ant's body, and in an instant, the ant's body quickly repaired and fused back together.</p><p></p><p>Moments later, the previously motionless ant immediately began to run anxiously on the tabletop, as if it had just had a nightmare.</p><p></p><p>"Amazing! It's truly a resurrection!" Ye Xiao couldn't help but exclaim in admiration.</p><p></p><p>However, this single small experiment was not enough to prove the power of the Mending the Heavens Technique, so he used various other methods to test it.</p><p></p><p>For example, he crushed the ant into powder, ground the ant's head, and dismembered the ant's head into eight pieces. But no matter how Ye Xiao manipulated it, the ant would ultimately be repaired.</p><p></p><p>The most powerful result was when the powdered ant was restored.</p><p></p><p>Does this mean that if his own body was reduced to powder, it could also be repaired? But there was also a bit of confusion, which was that after turning into powder, how could he execute the Mending the Heavens Technique? Would the technique execute itself? Even if it could execute itself, without his meridians, he naturally would not be able to control the spiritual energy, so how would the Mending the Heavens Technique function?</p><p></p><p>There was an even more important question.</p><p></p><p>Although the Mending the Heavens Technique is powerful, a cultivation technique is not only about its own strength, but also the strength of the subject it is used on.</p><p></p><p>It can quickly heal a small ant, but who dares to say that it can heal himself if he is cut into pieces, without taking a year or more, or even longer? By then, his cells would probably have dried out.</p><p></p><p>The risks and problems involved are too many. It's better to experiment in advance, not to wait until the day he battles a great cultivator and then hastily try to apply it. Thinking about it, Ye Xiao made a major decision.</p><p></p><p>He took a deep breath and directly used his sword qi to sever his own arm.</p><p></p><p>In an instant, a pain that tore at his heart and soul surged up.</p><p></p><p>"@!$#%#...&*!!!!"</p><p></p><p>It really hurt! Because his current cultivation was at the Xiantian Fourth Rank Grand Ancestor, the higher his cultivation, the more detailed his perception of his own body.</p><p></p><p>Moreover, he had also cultivated the Taixuan Tiangong, a spiritual power cultivation technique.</p><p></p><p>Here is the full English translation of the Chinese excerpt:</p><p></p><p>So it would hurt him even more! If it weren't for his incredible willpower, he would have cried out long ago. Without the slightest hesitation, he immediately activated the補天術 (Heavenly Restoration Technique), a flash of golden light, and his arm rapidly repaired itself, the pain disappearing, so he no longer felt so agonized.</p><p></p><p>The entire process took about four seconds.</p><p></p><p>Repairing one arm took four seconds, which was countless times faster than an ant. </p><p></p><p>But thinking about it carefully, his own strength was also far beyond that of an ant! His physical constitution was certainly countless times stronger than an ant's! So this data was still barely acceptable.</p><p></p><p>In any case, as his cultivation deepened, the speed of using the Heavenly Restoration Technique to heal would become even faster in the future.</p><p></p><p>It's just a pity that he couldn't do more experiments and accumulate more data.</p><p></p><p>Because it was too painful, even with his incredible willpower, he couldn't bear that kind of heart-wrenching agony.</p><p></p><p>He didn't have that kind of self-harming tendency.</p><p></p><p>"If only I had a test subject at the Patriarch Realm, the data might be even more accurate."</p><p></p><p>As soon as Ye Xiao finished speaking, a knocking sound suddenly came from outside the door.</p><p></p><p>"Master, quickly open the door, I'm back!"</p><p></p><p>This voice made Ye Xiao suddenly pause, then his eyes lit up.</p><p></p><p>It was as if he had summoned Cao Cao, and Cao Cao had arrived.</p><p></p><p>He immediately went out to welcome her.</p><p></p><p>The moment he opened the door, Ye Xiao was completely dumbfounded.</p><p></p><p>At this moment, Huan Liuli did not look like a Patriarch Realm expert at all, but rather more like a little girl scavenging for scraps.</p><p></p><p>Her dress was already torn, and her two shoes were nowhere to be found, the white stockings on her feet were covered in mud, and one of the stockings had a hole, revealing a delicate little toe.</p><p></p><p>Her little face was also covered in dirt, making him feel a bit sorry for her.</p><p></p><p>Forget it, it's best not to use Huan Liuli for experiments, she's already suffered enough, so let's spare her.</p><p></p><p>"Wuwuwu, Master, I finally get to see you again."</p><p></p><p>Huan Liuli threw herself into Ye Xiao's arms, wailing loudly.</p><p></p><p>Ye Xiao sighed softly, just about to reach out and stroke Huan Liuli's little head, when he heard her lament:</p><p></p><p>"Master, wuwuwu, I don't know which bastard threw me into the sea, and I can't even swim, I've been drifting in the sea for three whole days and nights!! If I find out who it was, I'll tear them to pieces, chop them a thousand times, grind their bones to powder, and shit and piss on their grave every day."</p><p></p><p>Ye Xiao's hand, which was about to stroke Huan Liuli's head, froze in mid-air as he looked at her gritting her teeth. Finally, his hand fell, and with a chop of his palm, he knocked Huan Liuli unconscious.</p><p></p><p>Then, he grabbed her slender ankle and dragged her into the courtyard like a little pig.</p><p></p><p>After a night of research and testing, Ye Xiao had finally fully grasped the principles of the Heavenly Restoration Technique.</p><p></p><p>The Heavenly Restoration Technique was indeed terrifyingly powerful! It not only could repair injuries, but it could even completely restore a life that had been reduced to ashes.</p><p></p><p>As long as you had enough vital energy, the Heavenly Restoration Technique could be used.</p><p></p><p>Overall, as long as you weren't vaporized, there wouldn't really be any major problems.</p><p></p><p>And the Heavenly Restoration Technique could self-repair.</p><p></p><p>This was undoubtedly equivalent to having an infinite revival for himself!</p><p></p><p>This is the end of the first update.</p>

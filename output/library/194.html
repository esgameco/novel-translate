        <h1>Chapter 194</h1>
        <div class="content">
            <p>Here is the full English translation of the Chinese excerpt:</p><p></p><p>So, it needs to keep being attacked in order to continuously improve its strength.</p><p></p><p>Therefore, if the spiritual energy is not enough, there would be no way to unleash the final attack.</p><p></p><p>Not being able to unleash the final attack also means it's impossible to unleash its greatest power.</p><p></p><p>Of course, this problem may cause a lot of trouble for Susan.</p><p></p><p>But for Ye Xiao, the problem is not that big.</p><p></p><p>He has already learned two divine cultivation methods, both at the Emperor Realm level - the Purple Veil Star Sea and the Dharma Sutra.</p><p></p><p>These two cultivation methods are sufficient to support Ye Xiao in taking the Imperial Extreme Sword Technique to an extremely powerful level.</p><p></p><p>However, even so, the Imperial Extreme Sword Technique is still just an Emperor Realm technique, and it has its limits.</p><p></p><p>In the later stages, the more spiritual energy it gathers, the slower its execution speed will become.</p><p></p><p>So strictly speaking, cultivating one's foundation should still be the priority!</p><p></p><p>Ye Xiao is not in a hurry. Right now, he has found three Xiantian Eighth-Grade spirit beasts, one of which can produce milk, one can make honey, and the two combined can greatly boost his cultivation every day.</p><p></p><p>Plus, his cultivation techniques are constantly refining, also continuously improving his cultivation.</p><p></p><p>Ye Xiao doesn't need to worry at all.</p><p></p><p>"Oh right, it's already the second day now. Yesterday I told them that today I would start collecting the shells, milk, and honey.</p><p></p><p>They should have prepared already.</p><p></p><p>It's been a long time since I've tasted milk and honey.</p><p></p><p>Huan Liuli."</p><p></p><p>"Coming, coming, the master is here."</p><p></p><p>"Go collect today's meat, eggs, milk, and honey, as well as the shells."</p><p></p><p>"Milk and honey?"</p><p></p><p>Huan Liuli looked puzzled.</p><p></p><p>Ye Xiao explained, "Last night I caught three Xiantian Eighth-Grade spirit beasts, one of which is a milk cow and one is a bee, and the other is a bug. The cow and the bee can provide milk and honey. I'm going to use the shells to refine armor."</p><p></p><p>Huan Liuli's soul trembled in shock!</p><p></p><p>What's going on? Three Xiantian Eighth-Grade spirit beasts? That's too amazing!</p><p></p><p>The master is truly remarkable, getting stronger and stronger.</p><p></p><p>No, this is too much. Having such a powerful master, just serving him for 1,500 years is too much of a loss.</p><p></p><p>No, I need to double it! 3,000 years! I'll be the master's servant for 3,000 years!</p><p></p><p>3,000 years is enough time for me to reap plenty of benefits.</p><p></p><p>Damn it!</p><p></p><p>"Master, don't worry, with me here, the task will be completed."</p><p></p><p>However, half an hour later, Huan Liuli limped back, leaning on a crutch.</p><p></p><p>"Waaah, master, please help me! Those bastards! Not only did they not obediently hand over the things, they even beat me up.</p><p></p><p>They said they would rather die than become livestock.</p><p></p><p>Waaah, my face is all swollen, please look, please look.</p><p></p><p>If it weren't for Nolphius and the others holding them back, they would have beaten me to death."</p><p></p><p>Ye Xiao furrowed his brows.</p><p></p><p>What's going on? </p><p></p><p>It's been a night already, and Nolphius and the others haven't done a good job persuading the three of them?</p><p></p><p>"Let me go take a look."</p><p></p><p>Ye Xiao used the Earth Traversal Technique to quickly arrive at the underground library, entering the sealed area.</p><p></p><p>As soon as he arrived, he saw Nolphius and the other spirit beasts also beaten up and bruised.</p><p></p><p>It was clear that Nolphius and the others had already become quite sensible, knowing to help restrain Huan Liuli.</p><p></p><p>Looking at Susan and the others, although there was a momentary fear in their eyes when they saw him, there was also a stubborn defiance in their gaze.</p><p></p><p>"So you're just unwilling to become livestock?"</p><p></p><p>Susan sneered, "Why don't you do it?"</p><p></p><p>The moment the words left her mouth, Ye Xiao punched her in the face.</p><p></p><p>Boom! With a violent explosion, Susan was blasted away, crashing into the array wall and bouncing back, falling at Ye Xiao's feet.</p><p></p><p>Ye Xiao stepped on her face.</p><p></p><p>"I told you to answer, not ask questions."</p><p></p><p>Susan was dazed and disoriented from the punch, her soul nearly leaving her body. </p><p></p><p>Damn it! It hurts so much, this bastard doesn't know how to treat a lady at all! In fact, Ye Xiao would never coddle her.</p><p></p><p>Ye Xiao is a human, a proper human. </p><p></p><p>She is a bee, even if her cultivation has advanced to the point of being able to evolve into a human form, she is still fundamentally a bee.</p><p></p><p>Who would pity a bee? Moreover, how many humans has she killed? When she killed humans, did she show any compassion? Any sympathy? Perhaps she even ate more than anyone else.</p><p></p><p>Ye Xiao increased the force on his foot, making Susan feel like her bee head was about to explode.</p><p></p><p>"Isn't it good to be a sensible bee? Why do you have to force me to act? If I act, you can't beat me. </p><p></p><p>Even if I kill you, I can just revive you again.</p><p></p><p>I really don't understand, what are you trying to achieve?"</p><p></p><p>Susan gritted her teeth, "You can torture me, but you can't make me become your livestock. I, a Xiantian Eighth-Grade divine beast general under the Tiger God, have my own dignity!"</p><p></p><p>Ye Xiao was silent for a moment.</p><p></p><p>"You want dignity, huh? Alright, I'll just completely seal your cultivation right now."</p><p></p><p>Here is the full English translation of the Chinese excerpt:</p><p></p><p>"Print it out and then sell it to the circus." He crouched down, lifted up Susan's head, and whispered in her ear:</p><p></p><p>"The human circus will tour the world. At that time, there will be countless people going to watch.</p><p></p><p>Moreover, since you are a primordial eighth-grade spirit beast, an existence that these humans can only dream of on ordinary days. You will definitely be able to satisfy their desire for revenge very well.</p><p></p><p>Just imagine, a bee, a primordial eighth-grade one! Performing under the human's whip, putting on shows, bringing joy to those humans.</p><p></p><p>How exciting? How fun? By then, you will definitely become famous all over the world.</p><p></p><p>You should have a lot of people respecting you, right!"</p><p></p><p>Susan shuddered violently.</p><p></p><p>Ye Xiao's move was too vicious!</p><p></p><p>He was simply a devil.</p><p></p><p>What she cared about the most was her self-esteem. If she was humiliated by the human insects she despised the most, performing as a clown in the human circus to entertain humans, and moreover, she would be completely powerless, and even the entire human race would see her.</p><p></p><p>She would rather just die.</p><p></p><p>But what's even more terrifying is that Ye Xiao definitely won't let her die! He will keep her alive, and alive forever.</p><p></p><p>If that's the case, to be honest, she would rather just be Ye Xiao's domestic fowl here.</p><p></p><p>At least, she only needs to produce honey.</p><p></p><p>Although it will still make her feel humiliated, serving only one human is much better than serving the entire human race, right?</p><p></p><p>Moreover, there is one more point.</p><p></p><p>If not too many people know about it, her dignity can be preserved.</p><p></p><p>In the future, when she escapes, she can take revenge on the humans crazily, at least there won't be too many people who know about her humiliation, and it won't spread to the spirit beast camp.</p><p></p><p>She will still be the primordial eighth-grade spirit saint beast, the great general under the Tiger God Lord!</p><p></p><p>After considering the pros and cons, she finally made a decision that went against her inner heart.</p><p></p><p>Although very reluctantly, she still gritted her teeth and said:</p><p></p><p>"There are no flowers here!"</p><p></p><p>"What did you say? Speak louder, I didn't hear you."</p><p></p><p>Susan gritted her silver teeth in anger, but still spoke again:</p><p></p><p>"There are no flowers here, our bee clan needs flowers to make honey. Otherwise, we won't be able to make honey."</p><p></p><p>Ye Xiao was stunned, not that he didn't know that bees need flowers to make honey, but he didn't expect that spirit beasts also need flowers to make honey.</p><p></p><p>"Having flowers is not a problem, but there's one thing I want to know.</p><p></p><p>Will the honey made with flowers contain spiritual energy? I need the honey that contains a huge amount of spiritual energy, which can be used to improve my cultivation, not just the honey that tastes sweet."</p><p></p><p>"It has spiritual energy, the honey made by our bee clan is all cultivated with spiritual energy. Of course, this is also closely related to the variety of flowers. </p><p></p><p>The better and more precious the flowers, the better the honey I brew."</p><p></p><p>Ye Xiao rubbed his temples.</p><p></p><p>It seems that he won't be able to eat the flower honey today.</p><p></p><p>Regrettable.</p><p></p><p>"I'll prepare the flowers later, but remember to make up for the amount of these few days."</p><p></p><p>Ye Xiao released her, then turned his gaze to Iron Cow.</p><p></p><p>Iron Cow shuddered violently.</p><p></p><p>Iron Cow painfully took off a piece of his shell and handed it to Ye Xiao.</p><p></p><p>"This is my shell."</p><p></p><p>"You're smart."</p><p></p><p>Ye Xiao took the shell and then turned his gaze to the last one, Moyu.</p><p></p><p>Moyu was startled and said with a slight cry:</p><p></p><p>"I, I don't have a bucket, don't sell me to the circus and let me perform for all the humans. If that's not possible, you can just come over and drink me directly."</p><p></p><p>Ye Xiao: "(_..)!"</p><p></p><p>"I'm not that crazy yet, start delivering from tomorrow, I'll let you off today."</p><p></p><p>Moyu heaved a sigh of relief.</p><p></p><p>"Thank you, thank you."</p><p></p><p>Ye Xiao sneered inwardly.</p><p></p><p>Look, this is what spirit beasts are like.</p><p></p><p>If your strength is not strong enough, they will treat you like food and eat you.</p><p></p><p>But as long as you are strong enough, they have to obediently become your domestic fowls.</p><p></p><p>The law of the jungle, the strong preying on the weak, is an unchanging law between humans and spirit beasts.</p><p></p><p>He quickly came to the ground and was about to go to work.</p><p></p><p>There were a lot of people coming to the library today.</p><p></p><p>The vast majority of them were from the Jianghai Martial Arts Academy.</p><p></p><p>The battle last night was too rushed, and the scope of the battle was a bit too large, destroying a lot of buildings.</p><p></p><p>So the school is closed for repairs today, and it should take a full day to fix.</p><p></p><p>Also, because the people in this world cultivate martial arts and work fast, plus the new building materials dry quickly, they can repair a half-destroyed campus in just one day.</p><p></p><p>Ye Xiao squeezed through the crowd, and his classmates around him were chattering. In addition to discussing last night's events, there were also some special topics that caught Ye Xiao's attention.</p><p></p><p>Six updates, 18,000 words.</p><p></p><p>Please recommend, vote for monthly tickets, and subscribe.</p><p></p><p>Thank you to book friend xuxiaacc for the reward, greatly appreciated.</p><p></p><p>(This chapter is complete)</p>

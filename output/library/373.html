        <h1>Chapter 373</h1>
        <div class="content">
            <p>Here is the full English translation of the Chinese excerpt:</p><p></p><p>Ye Xiao stopped his movements.</p><p></p><p>"Then let's go."</p><p></p><p>Ye Xiao used a healing technique to help the big fish recover its body.</p><p></p><p>Afterwards, he placed his hand on the big fish's body and used the Yin-Yang Escape Technique, disappearing from the spot in an instant.</p><p></p><p>In a certain place in the starry sky, the air distorted and a figure stumbled out.</p><p></p><p>It was a powerful cultivator from the Winged God Tribe, with half of its wings already fallen off, leaving only a half-broken wing. Its clothes were also heavily torn.</p><p></p><p>It panted heavily, its gaze somewhat scattered and dazed, yet also carrying a faint joy of surviving a calamity.</p><p></p><p>"I've finally escaped! The XuanYuan Clan is indeed not to be trifled with! Luckily I ran fast, or else I would have surely perished at the hands of Ning family's experts."</p><p></p><p>After a pause, it clenched its fists.</p><p></p><p>"But this time, I've completely torn off the mask with the Ning family. Fortunately, I've already passed on the message. Next time, it won't just be our three major clans, but also many allies.</p><p></p><p>When that time comes, even if you are the XuanYuan Clan, you won't be able to remain unscathed, will you?"</p><p></p><p>Just as it was about to flee and find a place to hide, the next moment, it suddenly discovered something.</p><p></p><p>"Huh? Isn't that... that damned fish?"</p><p></p><p>In an instant, its pupils constricted.</p><p></p><p>Damn it!</p><p></p><p>It's all because of that damned fish!</p><p></p><p>If it weren't for him, the three major clans wouldn't have attacked the Ning family, and naturally wouldn't have been wiped out by the reinforcements sent by the Ning family.</p><p></p><p>It had been puzzled earlier, why that damned fish, since it belonged to the Ning family, did not appear during the previous great battle? It turns out it was leisurely carrying someone and roaming around! Our three major clans had so many of our people annihilated, and you have the nerve to be so carefree?</p><p></p><p>Go to hell! Driven by the surging anger in his heart, the powerful cultivator from the Winged God Tribe immediately charged towards the fish.</p><p></p><p>But just as he was about to unleash his spiritual energy, a figure in the distance also sensed his aura.</p><p></p><p>"This aura, Divine Realm Fourth Realm, should be the Winged God Tribe expert that Zhiyuan mentioned escaped? Let me take care of him first, so I can meet up with Zhiyuan sooner."</p><p></p><p>With that, he also transformed into a beam of light and rushed over in pursuit.</p><p></p><p>On Ye Xiao and the big fish's side, they had just arrived in the starry sky. The big fish sensed something and used its fish head to point in a certain direction.</p><p></p><p>"That's the direction, that's my previous lair."</p><p></p><p>"That direction..." </p><p></p><p>Ye Xiao was somewhat taken aback. Why did that direction feel so familiar to him?</p><p></p><p>That direction seemed to be the former base of the Three Clans, where he had previously wreaked havoc.</p><p></p><p>The big fish chuckled:</p><p></p><p>"Correct, it's that place. Previously, I was sealed by your human ancestor, someone called Patriarch Zu Long, with a palm strike for over two thousand years.</p><p></p><p>Fortunately, recently, I don't know who, killed many people there, allowing me to absorb a lot of fresh blood and finally break the seal."</p><p></p><p>However, as the big fish said this, the smile on its face faded, as if something was not quite right. Now that it had escaped Patriarch Zu Long's seal, the situation seemed to have become even worse.</p><p></p><p>Being sliced and diced every day, without an ounce of dignity. </p><p></p><p>Damn it all!</p><p></p><p>Ye Xiao's mouth twitched. Sure enough, this big fish was the one he had released.</p><p></p><p>What a cycle of cause and effect. In the end, it was he who had captured it.</p><p></p><p>However, what Ye Xiao didn't expect was that the big fish had been sealed by Patriarch Zu Long with a palm strike over two thousand years ago. Patriarch Zu Long's strength was truly terrifying.</p><p></p><p>At that time, he had just emerged from the human world, right? </p><p></p><p>To be able to seal this Sovereign-level big fish with a single palm strike was simply astounding. </p><p></p><p>If Patriarch Zu Long were still alive, Ye Xiao couldn't even imagine how powerful he would be now.</p><p></p><p>Oh well, even if Patriarch Zu Long were still alive, Ye Xiao had no chance of seeing him now. It's better to first go find that Divine King's Tomb and improve his own cultivation.</p><p></p><p>However, just as he was about to leave, the next moment, an unexpected incident occurred.</p><p></p><p>An extremely strong killing intent suddenly surged towards him and the big fish.</p><p></p><p>The opponent's cultivation was actually at the Divine Realm Fourth Realm!</p><p></p><p>One realm higher than Ye Xiao's current level.</p><p></p><p>And it was a powerful cultivator from the Winged God Tribe! "Damned fish, die!"</p><p></p><p>The opponent roared, its killing intent erupting to the extreme.</p><p></p><p>Ye Xiao asked, "Do you know this person?"</p><p></p><p>The big fish shook its head. </p><p></p><p>"No, I've never seen him before."</p><p></p><p>Ye Xiao nodded. In that case, there was no need to stay any longer.</p><p></p><p>He raised his hand, aiming at the opponent, and directly unleashed the Annihilation Treasure Technique.</p><p></p><p>"Boom!"</p><p></p><p>The next moment, the Winged God Tribe's Divine Realm Fourth Realm expert with the broken wing was directly blasted into a bloody mist.</p><p></p><p>Under the Annihilation Treasure Technique, an opponent of a lower realm was easily dealt with by Ye Xiao. After unleashing this move, Ye Xiao directly took the big fish and used the Yin-Yang Escape Technique to disappear from the spot once again.</p><p></p><p>This scene was just witnessed by Ning Uncle Two, who had just arrived. His pupils instantly constricted, and his heartbeat couldn't help but accelerate.</p><p></p><p>"So strong!"</p><p></p><p>In an instant, he was able to instantly annihilate a Divine Realm Fourth Realm expert into a bloody mist. This level of ability, although he could also do it, he was at the peak of the Divine Realm!</p><p></p><p>He was at the Ninth Realm of the Divine Realm, far surpassing that Winged God Tribe expert by several realms.</p><p></p><p>But the one he just saw, although he didn't get a clear look at his face, just from the glimpse of his back, he could clearly feel that the other party was only at the Third Realm of the Divine Realm! And he was very young!</p><p></p><p>Perhaps even younger than Ning Zhiyuan, the number one young genius of the Ning family.</p><p></p><p>To reach the Third Realm of the Divine Realm at such a young age was already monstrous enough!</p><p></p><p>Here is the full English translation of the Chinese excerpt:</p><p></p><p>He was able to kill enemies by surpassing his level, this guy was truly extraordinary.</p><p></p><p>Who was he?</p><p></p><p>Which prodigy was he? With his strength, if placed on the Xuanyuan Prodigy Rankings, he would undoubtedly be able to steadily rank within the top three!</p><p></p><p>One must know that the gap in strength on the Xuanyuan Prodigy Rankings was enormous. Ning Zhiyuan ranked 17th, his strength only at the Sage Realm 74th Dragon, while the top ten were all experts above the Sage Realm! The top five could even be considered as rising stars among the geniuses across the entire starry sky.</p><p></p><p>The one ranked first on the Xuanyuan Prodigy Rankings was an existence that could rank among the top in the entire starry sky!</p><p></p><p>This young man, at such a young age, had already reached this level of strength. If given a few more years to cultivate, "No, I have to go back quickly and ask Zhiyuan. He has been here for so long, does he know about the existence of this person?"</p><p></p><p>An hour later, at the Ning family's base in the starry sky, Ning Zhiyuan had just walked out when he saw his second uncle.</p><p></p><p>He couldn't help but ask in puzzlement, "Strange, second uncle, weren't you chasing after that fleeing powerful expert of the Wing God Tribe?"</p><p></p><p>Ning's second uncle's face was extremely grave.</p><p></p><p>"He has been killed."</p><p></p><p>Ning Zhiyuan was stunned for a moment, then smiled and said:</p><p></p><p>"As expected, second uncle is formidable, your strike was successful."</p><p></p><p>Ning's second uncle shook his head.</p><p></p><p>"I did not kill him."</p><p></p><p>Ning Zhiyuan was puzzled and couldn't help but ask:</p><p></p><p>"What do you mean, second uncle?"</p><p></p><p>Ning's second uncle spoke again:</p><p></p><p>"I had just found him, and from afar, I saw him being killed by someone, and it was an instant kill."</p><p></p><p>"That powerful?" </p><p></p><p>Ning Zhiyuan was shocked.</p><p></p><p>"It seems that this has attracted the attention of many powerful experts, some have already come here."</p><p></p><p>"You guessed wrong again."</p><p></p><p>Ning's second uncle interrupted Ning Zhiyuan once more.</p><p></p><p>"That person was only at the Third Sage Realm, and he was very young, even younger than you."</p><p></p><p>Ning Zhiyuan's pupils immediately shrank, and his whole body was covered in goosebumps.</p><p></p><p>"Third Sage Realm? He was only at the Third Sage Realm? That Wing God Tribe expert was at the Fourth Sage Realm, yet he, at the Third Sage Realm, instantly killed him? If I'm not mistaken, although the other party was injured, it shouldn't have been to the extent that it affected his strength.</p><p></p><p>How could he be instantly killed by someone at the Third Sage Realm? Wait, you said he was very young? Could it be... could it be him?"</p><p></p><p>"You know him?" </p><p></p><p>Ning Zhiyuan immediately became ecstatic.</p><p></p><p>"Of course I know him, second uncle, did you see his face?"</p><p></p><p>Ning's second uncle said regretfully:</p><p></p><p>"No, his speed was too fast, so fast that it was unbelievable. After instantly killing the other party with a single move, he also used an extraordinary movement technique and instantly disappeared from the scene. I estimate that his methods are definitely above the Seven-Star Divine Arts!"</p><p></p><p>Ning Zhiyuan was also quite regretful.</p><p></p><p>"That's really too bad. I've actually been looking for him these past few days. When I first came here, I encountered a peerless genius in the process of tribulation. </p><p></p><p>His bone age was very young, and I didn't get a good look at his face, but his talent was too extraordinary. </p><p></p><p>Not only did he attract the strongest purple lightning tribulation in the starry sky, but he also had the Golden Body, Divine Eyes, and other heavenly and earthly anomalies, even having a Spiritual Dragon protecting his body, which is the bloodline of our Xuanyuan Clan."</p><p></p><p>"He is actually this powerful, and he is also of our Xuanyuan Clan's bloodline?"</p><p></p><p>Ning's second uncle exclaimed in shock, this was simply too shocking! Purple lightning tribulation, the Golden Body anomaly, the Divine Eyes anomaly... these were all top-tier rarities!</p><p></p><p>Many people could only dream of possessing even one of them in their lifetime, yet he had three.</p><p></p><p>What shocked him even more was that this person was also of the Xuanyuan Clan's bloodline.</p><p></p><p>"Wait a minute."</p><p></p><p>Ning's second uncle suddenly thought of something.</p><p></p><p>"You said he had just broken through to the Sage Realm when you encountered him, but it's only been three to four months since you came here.</p><p></p><p>That means, in just three to four months, he went from the First Sage Realm to the Third Sage Realm? Damn!"</p><p></p><p>At this moment, even Ning's second uncle couldn't help but let out a curse.</p><p></p><p>This person's cultivation speed was truly extraordinary.</p><p></p><p>One must know that in the path of the Dao, the higher one goes, the more difficult it becomes. Reaching the Sage Realm, each realm's advancement is as difficult as ascending to the heavens.</p><p></p><p>It requires not only one's own talent, but also heavenly treasures, cultivation techniques, and various cultivation resources, accumulated over and over again.</p><p></p><p>Only then can one achieve rapid advancement.</p><p></p><p>And this so-called rapid advancement is calculated in years.</p><p></p><p>For example, he himself had broken through to the Sage Realm 27 years ago, at the age of 48, but he was now only at the Ninth Sage Realm, with an average of about three years to advance one realm.</p><p></p><p>And this was with the support of abundant cultivation resources as a direct descendant of the Ning family.</p><p></p><p>Ning's second uncle couldn't help but sigh:</p><p></p><p>"This youth has already surpassed our Ning family, an entire generation ahead! If given a few more years, he might even completely surpass our current generation!"</p><p></p><p>Boom! This sentence was like a huge bomb exploding in Ning Zhiyuan's mind.</p><p></p><p>He actually received such high praise from his second uncle! This was simply unbelievable.</p><p></p><p>This made Ning Zhiyuan even more eager to get to know who this person was.</p>

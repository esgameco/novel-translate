        <h1>Chapter 224</h1>
        <div class="content">
            <p>Here is the full English translation of the Chinese excerpt:</p><p></p><p>"Xiaoyan, you're almost out of breath, don't speak for now."</p><p></p><p>Songxiaoyan's pupils were starting to dilate.</p><p></p><p>Although a martial artist's life force is a bit stronger than ordinary people, she had still suffered such heavy injuries! And she was not a supreme master above the sect leader level. Her physical strength had not reached that level.</p><p></p><p>"Yangqin, I'm sorry, I had to hit you at the bar today, I hope you don't blame me. The monkeys have come to pick me up, I should go now."</p><p></p><p>"Xiaoyan! Xiaoyan! Don't sleep, wake up!"</p><p></p><p>Yangqin shook Songxiaoyan and quickly turned around and called out to Yexiao: "Manager, don't you know healing magic? Can you please treat her?"</p><p></p><p>Yexiao did not make a move. Although Songxiaoyan still had some kindness, she had already accumulated a lot of blood qi, resentment, and impurity. </p><p></p><p>This meant she had killed many people.</p><p></p><p>Although becoming a demonic beast was not by choice, killing is still killing, and she had killed quite a few people, so Yexiao could not save her.</p><p></p><p>"Her soul has already been infected, even if she's revived, she will still be a demonic beast. Besides, I think what you should be concerned about now is not her."</p><p></p><p>Yexiao's words made Yangqin's gaze shift to the Black Snake.</p><p></p><p>The Black Snake stuck out its crimson forked tongue, its viper-like pupils emitting a chilling light.</p><p></p><p>"Hahaha, I originally wanted to give you all a little tender moment, and then eat you up. Now it seems you don't need that anymore."</p><p></p><p>Yangqin clenched her fists, her gaze filled with burning hatred.</p><p></p><p>She already hated the star beasts, and now seeing her former comrade transformed into a demonic beast by the star beast, her hatred was boundless.</p><p></p><p>"I'm going to kill you! And then use you to make snake soup!"</p><p></p><p>The Black Snake slowly released its aura.</p><p></p><p>"I also have the same intention, to use you to make soup."</p><p></p><p>Yangqin's face revealed a hint of seriousness.</p><p></p><p>The opponent's aura had actually reached the Innate First Grade, a sect leader level expert! So strong!</p><p></p><p>She took a deep breath and said calmly without looking back, "Manager, you should run. Someone has to get out alive and take this secret out, or the human race will be in trouble."</p><p></p><p>Yexiao: "(_..)!"</p><p></p><p>"Can you handle an opponent at the sect leader level?"</p><p></p><p>Yangqin's mouth curled up slightly, revealing a faint smile.</p><p></p><p>"Don't underestimate me, Manager. Although my cultivation is only at the post-Heavenly level, I'm actually very strong! Stronger than you can imagine!"</p><p></p><p>As she said this, her inner aura began to rise! Yexiao was slightly taken aback, not expecting Yangqin to have such a technique.</p><p></p><p>But upon closer inspection, he understood that Yangqin must be using some secret art to greatly enhance her strength in a short period of time.</p><p></p><p>At this moment, Yangqin's aura kept rising, quickly reaching the post-Heavenly Eighth Grade, post-Heavenly Ninth Grade, and finally the Innate First Grade powerful cultivation!</p><p></p><p>Yangqin seemed to have transformed into a different person, becoming gloomy, bloodthirsty, and filled with killing intent, like a bloodthirsty fierce beast, with only slaughter remaining in her eyes.</p><p></p><p>It seems this secret art, while able to greatly enhance her cultivation, also alters her personality. It must be an imperfect technique, as it amplifies her negative emotions to the extreme.</p><p></p><p>After Yangqin had consumed the star beast's core, the negative effects of using this art would be even stronger.</p><p></p><p>No, it can't be said that this art is not good enough, after all, it can raise a post-Heavenly martial artist to the Innate realm, so it is already a pretty good technique. It's just that compared to Yexiao, it is not perfect and excellent enough.</p><p></p><p>In simple terms, Yexiao is too strong, so he has already looked down on this level of technique.</p><p></p><p>After the aura surge, Yangqin's mind was clearly no longer stable.</p><p></p><p>"I'll kill you! Kill you!"</p><p></p><p>As her mind became more and more unstable, Yangqin soon went berserk. She stomped her foot, cracking the thick cement floor, and her body, aided by this powerful recoil force, turned into a beam of light and instantly charged towards the Black Snake.</p><p></p><p>Her speed was very fast, in an instant she was beside the opponent.</p><p></p><p>The air was stirred up, howling.</p><p></p><p>This powerful attack force would make an Innate sect leader-level expert have to be cautious.</p><p></p><p>But at this moment, an unexpected accident suddenly happened.</p><p></p><p>From the Black Snake's long robe, a black whip suddenly lashed out and viciously whipped Yangqin's body, accompanied by a sound of air exploding. Yangqin was immediately whipped away and fell heavily at Yexiao's feet, fainting.</p><p></p><p>Yexiao: "("▔□▔)!"</p><p></p><p>Although Yangqin had enhanced her cultivation, her combat experience was definitely far from reaching the sect leader level.</p><p></p><p>The opponent's snake tail hidden in the black robe had extremely strong power. Suddenly striking at close range made it impossible to defend against, and its power was even greater than an expert of the human race.</p><p></p><p>So Yangqin was unexpectedly knocked unconscious by a single strike.</p><p></p><p>"Tch! Flowery nonsense."</p><p></p><p>The sect leader-level Black Snake spat, then turned his gaze to Yexiao.</p><p></p><p>"Kid, now it's your turn. Are you going to knock yourself out, or shall I help you?"</p><p></p><p>Yexiao let out a long sigh, his face serious: "Actually, I'm quite strong too."</p><p></p><p>The Black Snake: "?(￣△￣?)!"</p><p></p><p>A late evening breeze blew by.</p><p></p><p>Here is the full English translation of the Chinese excerpt:</p><p></p><p>There was an awkward silence in the alley.</p><p></p><p>The face of the Black Snake Master was flashing and flickering with angry light.</p><p></p><p>"If you don't drink the toast, you have to drink the punishment wine."</p><p></p><p>After making this remark, it stomped its foot, instantly transforming into a bolt of lightning and charging towards Ye Xiao.</p><p></p><p>Its speed was even faster than Yang Qian's.</p><p></p><p>It had almost reached the realm of the Innate Second Grade. Swiftly as the wind and lightning!</p><p></p><p>The Black Snake Master left, leaving peacefully.</p><p></p><p>And its ascension speed was even faster than the speed at which it had defeated Yang Qian.</p><p></p><p>Until the moment of its death, its eyes still revealed a sense of arrogance and smugness.</p><p></p><p>Because Ye Xiao's speed was simply too fast, too fast for it to even react with shock.</p><p></p><p>"I told you, I'm very strong. You just wouldn't believe me."</p><p></p><p>Ye Xiao shook his head helplessly.</p><p></p><p>At this moment, accompanied by the sound of a siren, a patrol vehicle from the defense team also arrived at the entrance of the alley.</p><p></p><p>They were members of the patrol defense team.</p><p></p><p>"What's going on? What happened here? Why is there a fluctuation of spiritual energy?"</p><p></p><p>However, when they saw the body on the ground, they immediately began to be on alert.</p><p></p><p>Ye Xiao calmly explained:</p><p></p><p>"My friend and I were passing by here, and we saw a Tiger Demon harming people. Then my friend was about to take action, but later the Star Beast Master behind this Tiger Demon also came out, and in the end, it was killed by a passing Master."</p><p></p><p>"Where is that Master?"</p><p></p><p>Ye Xiao shook his head.</p><p></p><p>"I don't know. His speed was very fast. After killing this Star Beast, he just ran away. I was just about to call you when you arrived."</p><p></p><p>The members of the defense team looked at each other, somewhat stunned.</p><p></p><p>"Could you please come with us to make a statement?"</p><p></p><p>Ye Xiao nodded.</p><p></p><p>He went back and made a statement with the defense team. Yang Qian and the woman who had been knocked out by Song Xiaoyuan were also revived and made statements, which were basically consistent with Ye Xiao's.</p><p></p><p>Ye Xiao and Yang Qian also took the opportunity to tell the defense team about the news that the Star Beasts had produced a large number of Tiger Demons and released them all over the world.</p><p></p><p>This way, it would be convenient for the Nine Provinces to be on guard, so that there would be no global crisis in the future.</p><p></p><p>As for the Master that Ye Xiao had fabricated, it did not attract much attention.</p><p></p><p>This was the Central State, not a small place like Jianghai City.</p><p></p><p>With a large population and many masters here, the appearance of a Master was nothing special.</p><p></p><p>The entire incident ended perfectly.</p><p></p><p>Yang Qian originally wanted to do something for her comrade Song Xiaoyuan, so that she could be buried.</p><p></p><p>But unfortunately, her body was sealed and needed to be reported, so Yang Qian could not hand it over to her for burial.</p><p></p><p>For this, Yang Qian could only give up, and later bought some paper money to burn for Song Xiaoyuan, as a tribute to her.</p><p></p><p>Although Song Xiaoyuan had done many bad things, it was because she was forced to. She became a Tiger Demon and couldn't even commit suicide, so how could she stop herself from doing bad things?</p><p></p><p>But in the end, she was still concerned about the human race, so she wasn't too bad!</p><p></p><p>This matter dragged on until two or three o'clock in the morning before it finally ended.</p><p></p><p>The next day, since they had to start going for training, everyone had to get up early! Ye Xiao would definitely have no problem, as he was at the peak of the Divine Sect, and even if he didn't eat, drink or sleep for a year, it wouldn't be a big deal.</p><p></p><p>Yang Qian wasn't as strong as him, and her dark eye circles were very heavy.</p><p></p><p>Her colleagues naturally all knew that she had gone out to dinner with Ye Xiao the night before, but everyone tacitly understood and didn't say anything.</p><p></p><p>Young people, having a little story, isn't that a normal thing?</p><p></p><p>Moreover, Ye Xiao was so handsome, any woman would be moved by him.</p><p></p><p>If they were Yang Qian, they would also throw themselves at him.</p><p></p><p>Ye Xiao was also too lazy to explain. This kind of gossip-like thing, the more you explain, the worse it gets. If you just leave it alone, it will naturally disappear over time.</p><p></p><p>Everyone soon arrived at the training class.</p><p></p><p>The training class was set up at the Central State Martial Arts University, specifically for the Martial Arts Library.</p><p></p><p>The lecturers were all top professors from the Central State Martial Arts University.</p><p></p><p>The problems they discussed were basically about the research, classification, introduction, and statistical types of martial arts techniques.</p><p></p><p>But surprisingly, listening to their lectures was still very helpful.</p><p></p><p>There were some problems regarding martial arts techniques that Ye Xiao hadn't figured out before, but after applying their explanations, he gained some insights.</p><p></p><p>This doesn't mean that just because his cultivation is high, he understands everything.</p><p></p><p>High cultivation is only for his own imperial art techniques. It's like a rich person, their high EQ doesn't mean their other aspects are all perfect, they must still continue to learn and grow.</p><p></p><p>Indeed, one must live to the end and learn to the end.</p>

        <h1>Chapter 111</h1>
        <div class="content">
            <p>Here is the full English translation of the Chinese excerpt:</p><p></p><p>"Aren't you practicing the way of the sword? Is a throwing knife also considered a blade?"</p><p></p><p>Ye Xiao deliberately made a joke that lacked common sense.</p><p></p><p>Qin Yuyan picked up the throwing knife and smiled.</p><p></p><p>"The throwing knife is a hidden weapon, and I haven't specifically trained in hidden weapons either. This was bought by my uncle a few days ago and given to me.</p><p></p><p>It was forged by a very powerful weapon smith, and its power is much stronger than ordinary master-level throwing knives."</p><p></p><p>"Oh? Which weapon smith is so powerful that they can forge such a formidable throwing knife?"</p><p></p><p>Hearing this question, Qin Yuyan shook her head.</p><p></p><p>"I don't know that. The laws of the Nine Provinces prohibit private inquiries into the identities of weapon smiths. Only officials can make such inquiries.</p><p></p><p>My uncle previously wanted to use some means to find out, but I didn't let him, otherwise it would have caused a lot of trouble."</p><p></p><p>"That's quite a pity."</p><p></p><p>Ye Xiao spoke indifferently, and Qin Yuyan nodded, and the two then took their leave.</p><p></p><p>After leaving the library, Ye Xiao furrowed his brow and began to ponder.</p><p></p><p>It seems that even if he sells it to Old Man Xu, and Old Man Xu then sells it to the weapon shop, it's still not safe.</p><p></p><p>Old Man Xu will definitely sell it to the weapon shop in the end, and the weapon shop will record Old Man Xu's information. If someone really wants to investigate, it will be easy to trace back to himself.</p><p></p><p>Even if Old Man Xu doesn't say anything, the other party can still get a general idea from the bank transaction information.</p><p></p><p>And then they'll pinpoint him.</p><p></p><p>If it weren't for the hassle of going to the black market, he would have gone there long ago.</p><p></p><p>But for now, it's fine, as it's only a master-level throwing knife, not a particularly valuable weapon, so no one will deliberately keep an eye on him.</p><p></p><p>It's just that in the future, he can't do this kind of thing again.</p><p></p><p>There's one more thing, he needs to take the time to modify Old Man Xu's memory, including erasing the information about the throwing knife and the reason for the bank transfer with him.</p><p></p><p>Hmm, make it seem like the throwing knife was forged by Old Man Xu's ancestors.</p><p></p><p>As for the bank card transaction, it's because, well, he took a liking to Old Man Xu's cat, and Old Man Xu demanded that he leave the cat, so he spent money to make him leave.</p><p></p><p>But this doesn't seem very reasonable.</p><p></p><p>Although Ye Xiao doesn't want to belittle people, any normal person should think that it's Old Man Xu begging him not to leave the cat.</p><p></p><p>Better change it.</p><p></p><p>Make it that Old Man Xu wanted him to become a son-in-law, which is also reasonable, after all, he had this idea before.</p><p></p><p>There's another problem.</p><p></p><p>It's the cellar under his house.</p><p></p><p>That cellar was greatly expanded by Huan Liuli to store the meat of the black-scaled snakes, and although it's in the suburbs, there's still a chance it might be discovered occasionally.</p><p></p><p>Although he can use his spiritual power to interfere when he's at home, and no one will find it, but when he's not at home, it's still quite dangerous.</p><p></p><p>Especially now, with the Seven Stars Convergence approaching, to prevent Huan Liuli from going crazy, she has to stay by his side at all times.</p><p></p><p>Going to research the star formation and set up the star formation would take too much time.</p><p></p><p>He doesn't have the mind to study the star formation right now, and the short-term benefits to his improvement are not great, so it's not worth it.</p><p></p><p>He's heard that there are also very advanced cultivation methods that can control the power of space and store things.</p><p></p><p>But those cultivation methods are too advanced, and in a small city like Jianghai, it might not be easy to find them.</p><p></p><p>He'll have to consider forging a tool with spatial storage capabilities using his alchemy skills.</p><p></p><p>In the novels he's read in his previous life, there's something called a storage ring, right?</p><p></p><p>Ye Xiao has seen in the library books that this world also has some tools with spatial powers, but not as exaggerated as the storage rings in cultivation novels, and the powerful ones might still be able to store a lot.</p><p></p><p>Here is my translation of the Chinese excerpt:</p><p></p><p>Next, a big mountain! To make a storage ring, you would need special materials with spatial properties.</p><p></p><p>Regular steel is difficult to refine for this purpose. However, it is not expensive, because refining a spatial ring requires very high demands on the refiner.</p><p></p><p>At least a top-tier refiner would have the qualifications to refine a spatial ring. </p><p></p><p>Regular refiners, even if they obtain materials with spatial properties, would be useless.</p><p></p><p>And even if it's expensive, Ye Xiao is not worried. </p><p></p><p>Because from selling the flying daggers, Old Boss Xu just transferred him a lot of money, already over 100 something million, so now he's considered a small multi-millionaire.</p><p></p><p>Looks like he needs to go to the black market.</p><p></p><p>That night, Ye Xiao didn't eat dinner, nor did he eat snake meat. </p><p></p><p>The snacks at the black market are of many varieties, so he should occasionally change up the flavors.</p><p></p><p>Their nutritional value is certainly not as good as black-scaled snake meat, but foodies don't care if something has nutrition or not.</p><p></p><p>What foodies care about is just the distance from mouth to stomach.</p><p></p><p>As long as it tastes good, even stinky tofu can be YYDS! </p><p></p><p>Just like before, the master and servant duo went from east to west, eating from 10pm all the way to 12am.</p><p></p><p>By the time the black market started getting lively, Ye Xiao finally began his real business.</p><p></p><p>Activating the Profound Heaven Celestial Technique, sweeping his spiritual sense, Ye Xiao easily found some stalls selling spatial materials.</p><p></p><p>Obsidian! This is a material discovered in the starry sky, like a black, semi-transparent gemstone, containing faint spatial power within.</p><p></p><p>Because it not only has faint spatial power, but is also very hard, it is usually sold as decorations or other refining materials.</p><p></p><p>Ye Xiao quickly cleared out all the obsidian on that street.</p><p></p><p>There wasn't too much obsidian on this street, so Ye Xiao made a deal with the old boss he had traded black-scaled snake scales with before, a local named Wang Dailong. Ye Xiao left a thread of spiritual sense on him, not afraid he would run off.</p><p></p><p>Even if he ran, he wouldn't be faster than the Divine Intent Incantation!</p><p></p><p>After securing the obsidian, Ye Xiao prepared to head home. </p><p></p><p>The liveliness of the black market was just beginning, but most of it was useless to him.</p><p></p><p>However, just as Ye Xiao was about to leave, a commotion suddenly erupted in the center of the black market.</p><p></p><p>"A fight broke out! Over there a fight broke out!"</p><p></p><p>"Looks like someone's going to die tonight!"</p><p></p><p>Ye Xiao glanced over, and the small vendors next to Wang Dailong started chuckling.</p><p></p><p>"Serves him right! Let him bring out that treasure, this is the black market, without some power, how can you sell good stuff here?"</p><p></p><p>"That's right! Master-level armor, top-grade wind tiger hide, that thing is worth at least 3 million! Bringing it here, isn't he just asking to be envied?"</p><p></p><p>Wang Dailong smiled.</p><p></p><p>"What can be done? That thing of his, the source is not proper! If he doesn't sell it here, who else would he sell it to?"</p><p></p><p>Another small merchant immediately spoke up:</p><p></p><p>"That's not necessarily the case, at the end of the day, he's just being stupid. Spend some money, grease some palms, wouldn't that solve it?"</p><p></p><p>Looking at the excitement, gossiping, and offering advice, this was just the small merchants' little joys after their hard work.</p><p></p><p>"Someone died! Someone died!"</p><p></p><p>Soon, screams came from that direction.</p>

        <h1>Chapter 295</h1>
        <div class="content">
            <p>Here is the full English translation of the Chinese excerpt:</p><p></p><p>Until Ye Xiao slowly descended, the crowd had not fully reacted yet.</p><p></p><p>The Vixen Queen was slightly surprised and said, "Mr. Ye, just who are you exactly?"</p><p></p><p>Ye Xiao was rather speechless.</p><p></p><p>"There's no need to be so shocked, I'm still me, Ning Yuhen's friend. You just need to remember this."</p><p></p><p>After hearing these words, the Vixen Queen heaved a sigh of relief, and her inner shock turned into joy.</p><p></p><p>Ye Xiao was right, no matter what kind of strength he had, as long as he was Ning Yuhen's friend, that was enough.</p><p></p><p>Moreover, for Ning Yuhen to have such a powerful friend was truly fortunate! "Mr. Ye is right. Mr. Ye, the Imperial Relic Site has now fully manifested, you and Yuhen can use your blood to activate and open this Imperial Relic Site."</p><p></p><p>Ye Xiao nodded and looked at Ning Yuhen, who immediately ran over.</p><p></p><p>"Master."</p><p></p><p>"Give me a drop of your blood."</p><p></p><p>"Okay!"</p><p></p><p>Ye Xiao willed it, and from Ning Yuhen's fingertip, he took a drop of fresh blood, and also took a drop of his own.</p><p></p><p>Then, he dripped the two drops of blood into the gaps of the two large doors of the Imperial Relic Site.</p><p></p><p>After receiving these two different drops of blood, the next moment, the formation on the doors of the Imperial Relic Site began to rapidly radiate golden light, endlessly spreading outwards.</p><p></p><p>The next moment, the doors slowly opened, as if they had been granted permission.</p><p></p><p>From within the doors, an ancient and rustic aura burst forth, filled with boundless spiritual energy.</p><p></p><p>All the people present felt this rich spiritual energy, and their pores all opened up, their cultivation methods automatically starting to run, frantically absorbing the energy within.</p><p></p><p>"Master, let's go."</p><p></p><p>Ning Yuhen spoke, and Ye Xiao nodded. Ning Yuhen then took the lead and stepped inside.</p><p></p><p>But he had only taken a few steps when he had to stop in his tracks.</p><p></p><p>Because the spiritual energy gushing out from within was simply too much, like a tidal wave surging outwards.</p><p></p><p>With his innate Saint Monarch cultivation, he was unable to break through this spiritual energy and enter the relic.</p><p></p><p>The Silver Fox Clan members were not only worried, but also shocked and terrified.</p><p></p><p>"Such powerful spiritual energy!"</p><p></p><p>"How terrifying! This Imperial Realm expert has been dead for three thousand years, yet he can still unleash such thick spiritual energy, it's simply unbelievable."</p><p></p><p>"Is this the legendary Imperial Realm expert? Even after death, his strength is still so powerful! Then how strong would a living Imperial Realm expert be? They must be truly extraordinary!"</p><p></p><p>"No wonder they are called Imperial Realm experts? Among all the beings in the starry sky, how many can reach the Imperial Realm level?"</p><p></p><p>That a dead Imperial Realm expert's spiritual energy could prevent a Saint Monarch from entering his relic completely overturned everyone's worldview.</p><p></p><p>It seems that if one's strength is not enough, even if they encounter a great opportunity and come across the legendary Imperial Realm inheritance, they can only watch with dry eyes and be unable to obtain it.</p><p></p><p>Just as Ning Yuhen was at an impasse, Ye Xiao stepped forward.</p><p></p><p>Boom! In an instant, the spiritual energy that collided with Ye Xiao's body was split into two and gushed out in different directions.</p><p></p><p>He walked up to Ning Yuhen and helped him withstand the assault of the Imperial Realm spiritual energy.</p><p></p><p>"Walk behind me."</p><p></p><p>This calm sentence and his towering figure instantly calmed the young sapling that was Ning Yuhen in the raging wind.</p><p></p><p>He smiled slightly and nodded, silently following behind Ye Xiao.</p><p></p><p>After the two entered the doors, they thunderously closed, indicating that the Imperial Relic Site could only accommodate two people at a time.</p><p></p><p>Inside the Imperial Relic Site, there were no fancy or extravagant things, unlike the legends in novels where there were divine weapons and treasures everywhere.</p><p></p><p>Thinking about it, truly powerful experts are too lazy to carry around important items.</p><p></p><p>Useful heavenly materials and earthly treasures, they would just consume them directly. As for weapons, unless they were of the highest quality, they would not bother to bring them.</p><p></p><p>Moreover, most experts would only cultivate one or two martial arts, so they wouldn't have many weapons.</p><p></p><p>However, despite this, due to the thick spiritual energy nourishing this place for three thousand years, some good things had still been produced.</p><p></p><p>Ning Yuhen couldn't help but exclaim:</p><p></p><p>"Master, look, that Blood Spirit Fungus is so big, almost twenty to thirty square meters!</p><p></p><p>And over there, that Soul Spirit Grass is over ten meters long.</p><p></p><p>Heavens! If these were outside, others would fight tooth and nail to snatch them."</p><p></p><p>Ye Xiao calmly said:</p><p></p><p>"These are just minor things, the real treasures are the inheritances here. You and I need to comprehend different inheritances. I can feel that the inheritance of the Human Realm Imperial expert is on the left, while the inheritance of the Silver Fox Clan's ancestor is on the right. You go to the right."</p><p></p><p>"Yes!"</p><p></p><p>The two did not bother with the so-called heavenly materials and earthly treasures, but instead went to seek the inheritances.</p><p></p><p>Ning Yuhen quickly headed to the right, while Ye Xiao instantly teleported to the left position.</p><p></p><p>After arriving there, he released his soul power, and the next moment...</p><p></p><p>Here is the full English translation of the Chinese excerpt:</p><p></p><p>In a split second, the entire world changed. The heavens and earth were filled with peace and harmony, golden flowers blooming everywhere, celestial maidens scattering flowers, petals falling like rain.</p><p></p><p>Countless spiritual beings, some chasing and playing, some beating drums and making music, some drinking wine and reciting poetry - the entire scene was one of tranquility.</p><p></p><p>When Ye Xiao's soul merged into this world, it felt as if he had arrived in a completely new realm.</p><p></p><p>The Tyrant King, Zhou Wang, was indeed incredibly powerful and defied the heavens.</p><p></p><p>After his death, he used his spiritual power and soul force to forge a unique world here, where everything was formed according to his will. Whatever he wished this place to be, it would become so. It was as if he was the sovereign of this entire realm.</p><p></p><p>The scene had the air of the legendary "rivers of wine and forests of meat" from historical records, but was more elegant in comparison. Overall, it still exuded an atmosphere of extravagance and indulgence.</p><p></p><p>Ye Xiao's gaze fell upon a pavilion in the distance, where several burly men were drinking wine, their heroic spirit fully displayed.</p><p></p><p>"Whoever doesn't finish ten jars of wine is not allowed to leave!"</p><p>"Whoever finishes first gets a free drink."</p><p></p><p>After several rounds of drinking, only one man remained, smacking his lips with some disappointment.</p><p>"Ugh, no fun! They all passed out so quickly. After all, this is a realm forged by spiritual power - they can't even handle a bit of soul wine."</p><p></p><p>At this moment, Ye Xiao approached the pavilion, his hands naturally by his sides, staring intently at the man.</p><p></p><p>"It seems the historical records about the Tyrant King's later years being obsessed with extravagance and indulgence are true."</p><p></p><p>The burly man glanced at Ye Xiao, letting out a disgruntled hum.</p><p>"Here comes another lecturer. In my entire life, the first half was spent expanding the territory of the human race, defeating the star beasts' invasions time and again. Shouldn't I be allowed to enjoy myself now?"</p><p></p><p>"No, I was just making an observation, with no other intention."</p><p></p><p>"Hmph."</p><p></p><p>The Tyrant King waved his hand and took another sip of wine.</p><p></p><p>"After three thousand years, I thought a Sage Monarch expert would come here. But it turns out to be just a half-step Sage Monarch, not even a true Sage Monarch.</p><p>Has the human race really fallen to such a state?"</p><p></p><p>Ye Xiao did not respond. If it were someone else, these words might have been offensive. But for an old Sage Monarch like the Tyrant King, he had the right to say such things.</p><p></p><p>After a pause, the Tyrant King spoke again:</p><p>"What dynasty is the human race in now? How many Sage Monarch experts are left?"</p><p></p><p>Ye Xiao replied calmly:</p><p>"After the Shang dynasty, the human race has gone through dynasties like Zhou, Qin, Han, and so on, until now there are no longer distinct dynasties, but the Nine州Alliance instead.</p><p>As for Sage Monarch experts, aside from two who have been Sages for centuries, the rest of the Sage Monarch experts have mostly perished on the star battlefield, dedicating their lives for the human race."</p><p></p><p>The Tyrant King raised his brows.</p><p>"How pathetic. This strength is not even as good as one of my former armies."</p><p></p><p>Ye Xiao spoke:</p><p>"That is precisely why I have come here. Firstly, to gain insights from a Sage Monarch and completely break through to the Sage Monarch realm. Secondly, to understand the origins between the human race and the divine race. Thirdly, to inquire about why the Nine州has been declining."</p><p></p><p>The Tyrant King rubbed his head.</p><p>"I've finally had three thousand years of peace, and you just came in and made me think about those headaches again. Well, since you've already come here, and the human race is almost extinct, I suppose I should lend a hand."</p><p></p><p>He sat down in the chair and gestured for Ye Xiao to sit beside him. Ye Xiao sat down, and the Tyrant King poured him a cup of wine, which was brewed with the Tyrant King's own soul power. After drinking it, Ye Xiao's power was significantly enhanced! At the Monarch realm and above, the physical body and soul had completely fused, so anything that could boost the soul power or vital energy would ultimately strengthen the entire being.</p><p></p><p>Seeing Ye Xiao drink the wine, the Tyrant King smiled.</p><p>"How is it? The soul wine I brewed is not bad, right?"</p><p></p><p>Ye Xiao nodded, and the Tyrant King leaned back on the railing, a proud smile on his face.</p><p>"You're not bad, you know how to appreciate it. I like you. Let me think about how to answer your three questions. Hmm, let's start with the third one."</p><p></p><p>"The reason the Nine州human race has fallen to this state is due to the Zhou dynasty. At that time, there were not just me as a Sage Monarch expert, but the human race's bloodline had been declining, and they had not produced a Divine Monarch expert for a long time!</p><p></p><p>In order to cultivate a Divine Monarch, the human race had no choice but to establish a completely new cultivation system."</p>

        <h1>Chapter 233</h1>
        <div class="content">
            <p>Here is the full English translation of the Chinese novel excerpt:</p><p></p><p>Just as everyone was in despair, the next moment, an unexpected event suddenly occurred! From the south of Zhongzhou City, a sword beam even faster than the previous one suddenly shot out! Its power was almost on par with that sword beam.</p><p></p><p>Intertwined with thunderous lightning, in the blink of an eye, it directly severed Azu's sword beam.</p><p></p><p>Boom! Azu's sword beam, having lost the support of spiritual energy, exploded in the air like a dazzling nuclear bomb, kicking up a towering mushroom cloud.</p><p></p><p>The shockwave pushed all the clouds above Zhongzhou City backwards.</p><p></p><p>Within hundreds of miles, the clouds were continuously flowing backwards, and that awe-inspiring power made countless Zhongzhou martial artists and fleeing martial artists tremble in fear.</p><p></p><p>This simple attack was something they could never surpass in their lifetime! Its power was unparalleled under the heavens.</p><p></p><p>"What's going on?"</p><p>"Who made that move?"</p><p>"Could it be that a powerful expert from the human race has come to provide support? But how could they have arrived so quickly from such a distance?"</p><p></p><p>The Poison Dragon Scorpion Venerable and other star beasts were momentarily stunned, not expecting someone to be able to sever Azu's sword beam at such a critical moment.</p><p></p><p>This was completely beyond their expectations.</p><p></p><p>In the sky, Azu also had a moment of bewilderment.</p><p></p><p>Even for someone as powerful as him, in that instant, he hadn't even sensed the other party.</p><p></p><p>His gaze fell on Beitung Ce again, and now there was a young human beside him, casting a healing art.</p><p></p><p>Azu narrowed his eyes slightly, feeling excited, because he sensed a kindred spirit in this person.</p><p></p><p>That was the aura of a powerful expert!</p><p></p><p>This person's strength was on par with his own.</p><p></p><p>It was rare for ordinary people to have this kind of feeling, only super experts like him, who couldn't find opponents, would have this sensation.</p><p></p><p>The loneliness and coldness of being at the pinnacle!</p><p></p><p>While casting the healing art, Yexiao spoke calmly:</p><p></p><p>"I'm sorry, senior, I'm late."</p><p></p><p>Beitung Ce was extremely excited, Yexiao's previous sword strike was so powerful!</p><p></p><p>"Have you broken through to that realm?"</p><p></p><p>Yexiao shook his head.</p><p></p><p>"Not quite yet, but I'm almost there."</p><p></p><p>Beitung Ce felt a little regretful.</p><p></p><p>"That's too bad."</p><p></p><p>"No matter!" </p><p></p><p>Yexiao spoke again, then looked up at the sky.</p><p></p><p>"At least dealing with them is not a big problem now."</p><p></p><p>At that time, Shi Guanghao's group had also been seriously injured, facing several star beasts and the Poison Dragon Scorpion Venerable at the Innate Ninth-Grade, they couldn't hold on.</p><p></p><p>If it wasn't for Yexiao's sudden appearance, interrupting the battle, they might have already been seriously injured or fallen.</p><p></p><p>"That young man, who is he? Why have we never heard Beitung senior mention him before?"</p><p>"Not only have we never heard Beitung senior mention him, we didn't even know there was such a person in the Nine Realms."</p><p></p><p>The Poison Dragon Scorpion Venerable and the star beasts turned their attention towards Yexiao, slowly approaching him.</p><p></p><p>Shi Guanghao's group had already been severely injured, no longer posing a threat.</p><p></p><p>But if they wanted to kill them, it would still be difficult to accomplish at the moment.</p><p></p><p>The focus should be on Yexiao now.</p><p></p><p>Under Yexiao's healing, Beitung Ce's injuries had healed, and his combat state had returned to its peak.</p><p></p><p>He clenched his fists, unable to help but sigh inwardly.</p><p></p><p>Yexiao, so strong! Seeing the Poison Dragon Scorpion Venerable and the star beasts approaching, Beitung Ce's pupils flickered with a green flame! He spoke in a cold tone:</p><p></p><p>"I'll deal with these fellows, I can still handle them. You focus on dealing with Azu."</p><p></p><p>"No need, I can handle it alone."</p><p></p><p>Yexiao replied indifferently, his expression neither happy nor sad.</p><p></p><p>For him, as long as the cultivation level was within the same range, those he saw were basically doomed, let alone these small fry whose strength was already a level below his own.</p><p></p><p>Beitung Ce was slightly taken aback, then sighed with a sense of admiration and envy.</p><p></p><p>"He's still a young man after all! Youthful and reckless!"</p><p></p><p>Shi Guanghao and the others were also staring at him, seeing him going to fight alone, they were puzzled.</p><p></p><p>"Is he really going to fight alone?"</p><p>"Beitung senior has already been healed, why isn't he going to fight together with him?"</p><p></p><p>Lang Xinyue clenched her fists, she had probably already guessed the reason, but she felt it was too crazy to say it out loud.</p><p></p><p>Yexiao, most likely, no longer needed to take the opponent seriously, so he chose to fight alone.</p><p></p><p>The Poison Dragon Scorpion Venerable and the star beasts flew towards Yexiao.</p><p></p><p>"If you want to fight with Senior Azu, you'll have to get through us first."</p><p></p><p>The star beasts, swift as lightning and fierce as thunder, instantly transformed into a stream of light, slashing towards Yexiao.</p><p></p><p>Various energies gathered together, forming a huge encirclement, attempting to subdue Yexiao in one fell swoop.</p><p></p><p>However, in the next moment...</p><p></p><p>Boom, boom, boom, boom, the star beasts in the forefront directly exploded on the spot, shattering in the air.</p><p></p><p>Here is the full English translation of the Chinese excerpt:</p><p></p><p>The blood mist coalesced, like a brilliant and dazzling blood-colored firework, breathtakingly beautiful yet horrifying to behold.</p><p></p><p>Several Divine Ancestor Star Beasts were instantly killed on the spot!</p><p></p><p>This move immediately caused all present to have their pupils constrict.</p><p></p><p>"So strong!"</p><p></p><p>"My god, this guy is so terrifyingly powerful! Is he even human?"</p><p></p><p>They didn't even see him make a move!</p><p></p><p>Everyone knew this was not an ocular technique, but spiritual power.</p><p></p><p>Because his spiritual power was so incredibly strong, when it condensed into a tangible form and was unleashed upon the opponent, it could instantly explode their flesh and blood.</p><p></p><p>This in itself was not a serious problem. Even these Divine Ancestor experts could use such techniques when fighting weaker opponents.</p><p></p><p>But the issue was, the ones just now were not weak at all - they were all genuine Divine Ancestor experts. Yet they were almost crippled by Ye Xiao's spiritual power. This guy's power was simply monstrous.</p><p></p><p>But the shock was far from over.</p><p></p><p>Next, the Innate Ninth Grade Poisonous Scorpion Venerable released a poisonous mist, enveloping Ye Xiao within it. This poisonous mist, upon contact with the air, produced a sizzling, burning sound. It could damage spiritual energy, and no matter how strong the opponent was or what kind of protective gear they wore, they would almost certainly not be able to escape unscathed under this poisonous mist's assault.</p><p></p><p>But before the crowd could even start worrying for him, the next moment, a golden sword beam suddenly slashed out from the vast poisonous mist, ruthlessly tearing apart the mist in an instant.</p><p></p><p>The Poisonous Scorpion Venerable's pupils constricted, completely not expecting this to happen. His poisonous mist not only had potent toxicity, but was also imbued with a massive amount of spiritual energy. Even beings at the same level would not be able to easily cleave through his poisonous mist.</p><p></p><p>Yet now, this Ye Xiao had effortlessly sliced through the mist with a single sword strike. This was simply too heaven-defying, wasn't it?</p><p></p><p>No, this was not the time to ponder about this. Given how powerful the opponent was, he should not continue standing there foolishly, but should quickly flee.</p><p></p><p>But just as he had this thought and was about to turn and fly away, in the next moment, he saw Ye Xiao slowly raise his right hand.</p><p></p><p>Plucking the Stars Hand, activate!</p><p></p><p>With just a slight movement of his right hand, the next moment, the entire body of the Poisonous Scorpion Venerable was fixed in place, as if frozen.</p><p></p><p>"Noâ€”!"</p><p></p><p>His face instantly contorted in horrified panic, but before he could react, Ye Xiao's right hand clenched slightly, and the next moment, he had directly crushed the Poisonous Scorpion Venerable into a meat patty.</p><p></p><p>Crack, crack, formed in an instant.</p><p></p><p>He didn't even have the chance to say any last words.</p><p></p><p>Everyone's hearts trembled, another instant kill!</p><p></p><p>And this time, the opponent was a Ninth Grade Innate expert, a super powerful existence.</p><p></p><p>This was just too terrifying, wasn't it? The previous few were only Seventh Grade Star Beasts, so killing them could still be considered reasonable. After all, everyone could still think he might be a Ninth Grade Divine Ancestor.</p><p></p><p>But now, he had directly killed the Ninth Grade Poisonous Scorpion Venerable as well, and it was even a long-range kill.</p><p></p><p>Just how powerful was this guy? The last Star Beast, the Tree Demon, was completely terrified after witnessing this scene.</p><p></p><p>Damn, this guy was just too strong! Those guys were all Divine Ancestor experts of at least Seventh Grade, and there was even a Ninth Grade powerful existence among them.</p><p></p><p>This was like killing little children with a single sword strike! No, he absolutely could not get involved. Otherwise, he would definitely die as a Star Beast. Thinking of this, he did not dare to be careless at all, and immediately unleashed his cultivation technique, trying to flee from here.</p><p></p><p>However, just as he turned around, a sword beam suddenly plummeted from the sky above, piercing through his chest.</p><p></p><p>This attack was so powerful that even though he had healing arts, he still could not save himself. His foundation had been completely destroyed.</p><p></p><p>It was Ä€ ZuÇ’ who had struck.</p><p></p><p>He had killed the Tree Demon.</p><p></p><p>The Tree Demon turned back with a look of disbelief on his face, his gaze filled with bewilderment.</p><p></p><p>He was a Star Beast, and Ä€ ZuÇ’ was also a Star Beast.</p><p></p><p>Why did the other party kill him? Ä€ ZuÇ’'s gaze swept over him with extreme disdain.</p><p></p><p>"The others have all died in the charge, and you're the only one left. You actually wanted to run? You're making our Star Beast clan lose all face.</p><p></p><p>Such a waste, let me send you on your way."</p><p></p><p>The Tree Demon's body plummeted towards the surface of the river.</p><p></p><p>Until the moment of his death, he still had a dumbfounded expression.</p><p></p><p>If he couldn't win, couldn't he at least run? We're all Star Beasts, why did we have to trouble each other? Ä€ ZuÇ’ didn't bother to think about what the Tree Demon was thinking. The Tree Demon was his subordinate, and the result had made him lose face in front of Ye Xiao.</p><p></p><p>Of course he had to kill him.</p><p></p><p>Next, the one he had to deal with was Ye Xiao.</p>

        <h1>Chapter 399</h1>
        <div class="content">
            <p>Here is the full English translation of the Chinese excerpt:</p><p></p><p>"Brother Li, it's not really a good idea for us to sneak into the territory of the Xuanyuan Clan. If we get discovered, we'll be done for."</p><p></p><p>"You don't understand anything! The Xuanyuan Clan has even activated a grand formation! There must be an incredibly rare treasure in their territory.</p><p></p><p>We've been toiling away in the starry skies, digging up graves for ages, but all the benefits go to the higher-ups. We do all the dirty and tiring work.</p><p></p><p>If we can pull this off, we'll never have to worry about food and clothing again. Brother, I'll even get you ten beautiful women from the Yishen Clan as wives. You can eat big steamed buns for the rest of your life!"</p><p></p><p>"Big, big steamed buns."</p><p></p><p>The other person couldn't help but swallow hard, the last trace of hesitation disappearing from his eyes.</p><p></p><p>"Brother Li, I do have one more question. Getting in here was easy, but getting out might not be so simple, right?"</p><p></p><p>"Hehe, you just don't understand, little fool.</p><p></p><p>Didn't we previously excavate a tomb at the Slaughter God Realm? There were a few divine talismans that could directly traverse space. I saw the instructions and they were forged by a Saint King expert, so I secretly kept three of them on me.</p><p></p><p>As long as we find that treasure, we can easily leave this place."</p><p></p><p>"Brother Li is truly wise."</p><p></p><p>"Now let's go ask someone and see if we can find any clues."</p><p></p><p>"But this is an unparalleled treasure. Is it really possible to just ask someone and get the information?"</p><p></p><p>"How would we know if we don't try?"</p><p></p><p>The two quickly descended to the ground and scanned the street, soon spotting a figure.</p><p></p><p>"Brother Li, do you see that person? Wearing tattered clothes, carrying an iron pot, and whenever he approaches someone, they give him some money. He must be an extraordinary expert."</p><p></p><p>Brother Li nodded.</p><p></p><p>"You're right, great experts often appear unassuming, not caring about their appearance or attire. </p><p>But they are often deeply hidden, with extraordinary abilities. Let's go ask him."</p><p></p><p>They followed the man into a foul-smelling alley, using their spiritual energy to block their noses.</p><p></p><p>The ragged man was lying in a pile of trash, counting his earnings for the day.</p><p></p><p>"Not bad today, made over 200 in just an hour, and even got a spirit stone worth several hundred. Hehe, at this rate, I can buy my son another house by the end of the year."</p><p></p><p>As soon as he finished speaking, two unfamiliar figures suddenly appeared before him, smiling at him.</p><p></p><p>He carefully tucked the money and spirit stone into his pocket, asking, "What do you want?"</p><p></p><p>The two smiled slightly.</p><p></p><p>"Friend, don't be alarmed. We just want to ask you about a few things."</p><p></p><p>They then pulled out a small handful of spirit stones from their pockets.</p><p></p><p>Seeing the spirit stones, the old beggar's eyes immediately lit up as he eagerly took them.</p><p></p><p>"You gentlemen have good eyes. I know everything that happens in this Jianghai City. </p><p>You know Ning Zhiyuan, the young master of the Ning family, the core clan of the Xuanyuan Clan? I can tell you all about his affairs, including his mistresses and home address."</p><p></p><p>"We don't care about that. We just want to know, did a rare treasure appear in the Nine Realms last night?"</p><p></p><p>The old beggar slapped his thigh.</p><p></p><p>"Ah, I know exactly what you're talking about! There's been a great treasure found in our Nine Realms - the Perfected Treasure!"</p><p></p><p>"Perfected Treasure?!"</p><p></p><p>The two men's pupils immediately constricted, and their entire bodies broke out in a cold sweat.</p><p>A Perfected Treasure! No wonder it attracted the worship of countless cultivators! And the Xuanyuan Clan even had to activate a grand formation to prevent others from entering.</p><p>They must be afraid of others discovering this Perfected Treasure.</p><p>The value of a Perfected Treasure is beyond question.</p><p></p><p>"Has the Xuanyuan Clan obtained that Perfected Treasure yet?"</p><p></p><p>"Based on my many years of experience, they definitely haven't found it yet. If they had, they wouldn't be guarding it so tightly and keeping the news secret."</p><p></p><p>The two brothers exchanged a glance, growing even more excited.</p><p>The Perfected Treasure hasn't been found yet - this is a huge stroke of luck for them! Their trip to the Xuanyuan Clan's territory wasn't in vain after all! If they can find this Perfected Treasure first, they'll be set for life!</p><p></p><p>"Oh, you gentlemen, this is an absolute secret. I'm the only one who knows about this, so you can't let anyone else find out. </p><p>If the Ning family finds out, they'll have our heads."</p><p></p><p>The two men exchanged a smile.</p><p>"You've reminded us, of course we can't let anyone else know about this. The fewer people who know, the better."</p><p></p><p>Here is the full English translation of the Chinese excerpt:</p><p></p><p>The old beggar still didn't understand their meaning, and the next second, his neck felt a sharp pain as his consciousness slipped into darkness.</p><p></p><p>The two men sneered and left the alley.</p><p></p><p>"Shixiong, this matter may not have spread within the Xuanyuan Clan yet. We two must seize the opportunity before the news fully spreads, and find that supreme treasure first."</p><p></p><p>"Well said. That supreme treasure is an unparalleled treasure, and it must be hidden somewhere in the Nine Provinces. Let's start from Jianghai City and see if we can find any clues."</p><p></p><p>On Ye Xiao's side, he had been reading books all day, feeling utterly speechless.</p><p></p><p>He didn't know how the Xuanyuan Clan was shielding the news, but why did it feel like everyone knew about it?</p><p></p><p>Their secrecy work was really too sloppy, wasn't it?</p><p></p><p>Ye Xiao reckoned that except for the Ning family thinking others didn't know, everyone else already knew.</p><p></p><p>What made him even more speechless was that the Jing Emperor had secretly contacted him, asking him to find a way to obtain that supreme treasure.</p><p></p><p>Saying that this item appeared in the Nine Provinces, and it was destined to belong to him.</p><p></p><p>Well, wasn't it his then? It was something he had refined himself, so who else could it belong to? It seems he couldn't casually play with the Divine Creation Art in the future.</p><p></p><p>Right now, he really wanted to further improve his cultivation.</p><p></p><p>He had originally thought that after synthesizing the third Ancient Treasure Art, his cultivation should be able to rise another level, break through to the Second Realm of the Deicide Realm, just like when he reached the Divine Realm, each time he synthesized an Ancient Treasure Art, his strength would quickly rise again.</p><p></p><p>Regrettably, this time, his cultivation didn't increase much, at least, it was far from enough to advance.</p><p></p><p>Ye Xiao estimated that it was because his cultivation had risen, and the spiritual energy required for advancement was more and stronger.</p><p></p><p>So after the synthesis of the Ancient Treasure Art, he was no longer able to advance a realm.</p><p></p><p>It seems he should use those poisons to refine some pills, and then advance.</p><p></p><p>However, this time, Ye Xiao didn't want to create something like the Great Dragon again. He considered it and decided to refine the pills separately.</p><p></p><p>That is to say, not to treat them as a whole and refine an extremely powerful pill, but to refine each poison fog separately into a pill.</p><p></p><p>This would waste a lot of time, but it would also lose a little bit.</p><p></p><p>Because in addition to the blood qi and power of the star beasts themselves, the pill refining process will also continuously absorb the spiritual energy of heaven and earth.</p><p></p><p>The higher the grade of the pill, the more spiritual energy it can absorb, and vice versa.</p><p></p><p>So in a strict sense, low-grade pills are far inferior to high-grade ones.</p><p></p><p>But there's no help for it, just refining a weapon has already attracted so much attention, if he refines pills even more impressively, creating some heavenly and earthly anomalies, who knows how many powerful experts it will attract?</p><p></p><p>So Ye Xiao used the Divine Creation Art to frantically refine pills, working while secretly refining, and perhaps because the energy gathered by the pills he refined was not too high, there was no reaction around, which made Ye Xiao feel a little relieved.</p><p></p><p>The poisons from the Divine King's Tomb were refined into more than a thousand pills.</p><p></p><p>Next, Ye Xiao could eat the pills like eating jelly beans, continuously improving his strength.</p><p></p><p>He roughly estimated that after consuming all these pills, his cultivation would at least break through to the Second Realm of the Deicide Realm within half a month to one month.</p><p></p><p>This speed is actually quite impressive. If it were someone else, even if their talent was monstrous, it would take them a few years to break through from the First Realm of the Deicide Realm to the Second Realm.</p><p></p><p>And just before he got off work, two figures quietly came to the vicinity of his house, which were Li Shixiong and his junior.</p><p></p><p>The two of them were holding a compass, and when they arrived near Ye Xiao's residence, the pointer on the compass started spinning frantically.</p><p></p><p>"The magnetic field is malfunctioning, it seems there is a very precious treasure here, we two are in luck."</p><p></p><p>"Could it be that supreme treasure?"</p><p></p><p>"It doesn't matter what it is, as long as we can get it, it will be a huge fortune. It should be underground here, let's use the Earth Traversal Technique to go down."</p><p></p><p>"Good!"</p><p></p><p>The two of them used the Earth Traversal Technique and instantly disappeared from the spot.</p><p></p><p>The next moment, "Duang~!"</p><p></p><p>"Ouch!"</p><p>"Damn it! It hurts so much!"</p><p>"Who's so mean! They've set up a formation underground! I almost broke my neck."</p><p></p><p>"Since there's a formation, it means there must be something good here. Let me use the talisman to break through this formation."</p><p></p><p>"As expected, Shixiong has good ideas. This formation is no match for the two of us."</p><p></p><p>Chuckling, Li Shixiong took out a talisman.</p>

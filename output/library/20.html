        <h1>Chapter 20</h1>
        <div class="content">
            <p>Here is the full English translation of the excerpt from the Chinese novel:</p><p></p><p>That alluring cat-like gait revealed endless smugness.</p><p></p><p>"Hmph! You think you can just steal whatever you want? I am the proud bloodline of the Phantom Cat Celestial Beast! A Grandmaster-level Celestial Beast! Since I stole it through my own abilities, why can't I steal it? </p><p></p><p>Don't think that just because you're now stronger, and I've been forced to become your celestial pet, that you can do whatever you want. </p><p></p><p>I'm not someone you can just control however you want! Wait until my cultivation breaks through, and my spiritual power greatly increases - I'll definitely make you my personal pet!"</p><p></p><p>As Huan Liuli was strolling out leisurely, she happened to see Ye Xiao standing by the roadside, gazing at a huge boulder outside.</p><p></p><p>"Huh? What's he spacing out about now?"</p><p></p><p>She thought to herself.</p><p></p><p>In the next moment, as she was pondering, Ye Xiao's spiritual power erupted, directly shattering the massive boulder into rubble.</p><p></p><p>"Meow—!"</p><p></p><p>Huan Liuli let out a shrill scream, her tail standing straight up, her fur bristling all over, her eyes bulging, her jaw dropped open, and the fish in her mouth fell to the ground.</p><p></p><p>What did she see? Ye Xiao destroyed a huge boulder with just his spiritual power? Ye Xiao's spiritual power had actually solidified into a tangible form?</p><p></p><p>Was he joking with her? Was there some mistake? She didn't know that Ye Xiao had cultivated spiritual power, thinking he only practiced the martial dao. For his spiritual power to solidify, that would require at least the level of a Great Grandmaster, wouldn't it?</p><p></p><p>Her master was actually a powerful Spiritual Grandmaster? At this moment, Ye Xiao sensed the movement and glanced back at her, seeing the fish on the ground, furrowing his brows.</p><p></p><p>"Did you steal something again?"</p><p></p><p>Huan Liuli hurriedly shook her head in fright.</p><p></p><p>"No no, this is something I picked up, someone else dropped it and didn't want it."</p><p></p><p>Damn it, if she said she stole it, she'd probably get killed by Ye Xiao.</p><p></p><p>Although Ye Xiao was a bit skeptical, he didn't go check the surveillance or anything, and just turned around to head back to the library.</p><p></p><p>Huan Liuli heaved a sigh of relief.</p><p></p><p>Luckily, her brain usually works pretty fast, otherwise she might have ended up like that boulder.</p><p></p><p>She picked up the fish from the ground and leisurely followed behind him.</p><p></p><p>It seems this master of hers is really powerful, not an ordinary person at all! In that case, it won't be easy for her to break free of his control.</p><p></p><p>But having such a powerful master might not be too bad either, at least he can protect her safety.</p><p></p><p>"No no no!"</p><p></p><p>Huan Liuli shook her head vigorously.</p><p></p><p>How could she submit to the tyranny of a human? </p><p></p><p>She is the proud bloodline of the Phantom Cat Celestial Beast! Even among Celestial Beasts, she is an exceptionally extraordinary existence.</p><p></p><p>Her future will definitely surpass that of a Great Grandmaster, how could she acknowledge a human as her master?</p><p></p><p>But for now, she'll just have to endure and wait. Once she reaches a certain level of growth, she'll kick him out without hesitation.</p><p></p><p>Celestial Beasts are different from humans - they only need time to grow, or to devour stronger beings, to automatically become stronger. So Huan Liuli doesn't need to worry about her future cultivation at all.</p><p></p><p>Okay, it's decided! She'll be his servant for two hundred years! On Ye Xiao's side, he returned to the library to continue reading.</p><p></p><p>Spiritual cultivation techniques are not easy to find, after all, the mainstream in this world is still the martial dao.</p><p></p><p>Seeing it was past 2 o'clock, the work bell rang, and that fellow Gu Hai suddenly emerged from somewhere.</p><p></p><p>"Old Ye, reading books again?"</p><p></p><p>Ye Xiao put down the book, slightly raising his head to glance at him, seeing Gu Hai full of energy and joy, and replied indifferently:</p><p></p><p>"During work hours, why do you have time to come here?"</p><p></p><p>"Hehe, we recently got some interns, right? They're all on the second floor now, I brought one of them and let him cover for me. I'm taking the chance to sneak over here."</p><p></p><p>Here is the full English translation of the Chinese excerpt:</p><p></p><p>"I'm free, so I came to play with you. Also, there's something I want to talk to you about."</p><p></p><p>"Go ahead."</p><p></p><p>Ye Xiao casually picked up the book again, clearly prepared to read while listening to Gu Hai's rambling.</p><p></p><p>After all, nine out of ten times, what he said was not something serious.</p><p></p><p>"I'm getting married."</p><p></p><p>Poof.</p><p></p><p>The book Ye Xiao had just picked up fell to the ground in an instant.</p><p></p><p>He tilted his head and looked at Gu Hai, his brows furrowing into a "川" shape.</p><p></p><p>Gu Hai's face couldn't help but twitch.</p><p></p><p>"What's with that expression? I'm a young man in the prime of my life, it's normal for me to be thinking about marriage, isn't it?"</p><p></p><p>"No, I'm just curious, whose daughter is it that you're going to ruin?"</p><p></p><p>"You'll be surprised when you hear it. It's someone we both know."</p><p></p><p>Ye Xiao was silent for a moment.</p><p></p><p>"Wang Jie?"</p><p></p><p>Gu Hai: "..."</p><p></p><p>"Wang Jie could be your mother, are you being serious?"</p><p></p><p>Ye Xiao shook his head.</p><p></p><p>"Just tell me directly, I don't want to waste brain cells."</p><p></p><p>"Alright, I won't keep you in suspense then. It's Old Lu's daughter."</p><p></p><p>Ye Xiao: "..."</p><p></p><p>This time, it was Ye Xiao's turn to be at a loss for words.</p><p></p><p>"The Old Lu from the defense squad?"</p><p></p><p>"That's right. But from now on, you can't just call him Old Lu anymore, you'll have to call him Uncle Lu. I've been caught by him so often, and he sent his daughter to educate me ideologically. But my personal charm is too great, and she's fallen for me secretly. Isn't that impressive, my friend?"</p><p></p><p>"Will Old Lu agree to it?"</p><p></p><p>"Of course he won't agree. But there's no helping it, the rice has already been cooked. And the seeds have been planted. If he doesn't agree now, he'll be harming his own grandchild."</p><p></p><p>"That's a pretty underhanded move."</p><p></p><p>"Don't say that. This time, I've truly repented. I'll be a good person from now on, always striving forward. That's why I've even started preparing for the defense squad exam. I promised my dad that I'll become a member of the defense squad, so he can keep an eye on me."</p><p></p><p>Ye Xiao was even more at a loss for words. Gu Hai had already started calling his dad.</p><p></p><p>But since this good friend of his could turn over a new leaf, Ye Xiao was genuinely happy for him.</p><p></p><p>"Alright, congratulations. When are you planning to resign?"</p><p></p><p>"No need to rush. Joining the defense squad isn't something that can be achieved overnight. And if I don't resign now, I can still collect a wedding gift from the library. Just remember, our brotherhood is the best, so you better not give me a measly two hundred bucks."</p><p></p><p>"Don't worry, I know what's what."</p><p></p><p>"Oh right, there's one more thing I came to see you about. Yesterday, my wife and I were strolling through the antique market, and I bought some things, including an ancient book. I can't make sense of it, but you love reading, so here, I'm giving it to you. If you don't like it, you can just throw it away."</p><p></p><p>The moment Ye Xiao saw the book, the Golden Book inside him trembled noticeably, causing Ye Xiao's gaze to shift.</p><p></p><p>It was a book of fundamental martial arts techniques.</p><p></p><p>He took it and looked at the ancient text, not recognizing all the characters, but he could vaguely make out the character for "sword".</p><p></p><p>This was a book of sword techniques.</p><p></p><p>Ye Xiao was delighted. It was actually a sword technique manual, no wonder the Golden Book had reacted.</p><p></p><p>His sword techniques were still missing the last type, and now he could finally complete the fusion.</p><p></p><p>(This chapter ends)</p>

        <h1>Chapter 156</h1>
        <div class="content">
            <p>Here is the full English translation of the Chinese excerpt:</p><p></p><p>At this moment, the entire street had fallen into a deathly silence.</p><p></p><p>Everyone was staring intently at Ye Xiao, even though the golden light behind him had disappeared and everything had returned to normal. His imposing figure still stood out among the crowd, like a god that commanded utmost reverence.</p><p></p><p>The reason was simple - the people had realized that he was a powerful expert.</p><p></p><p>Strong enough to be worshipped and looked up to like a deity.</p><p></p><p>"Uncle! It's Uncle!" A familiar voice came from the crowd. It was the little girl, Xiao Yi, who had just played with Ye Xiao in the park.</p><p></p><p>At this moment, she had recognized Ye Xiao and was excitedly pointing at him, explaining to her mother.</p><p></p><p>Xiao Yi's mother was a bit flustered. She stared at Ye Xiao with wide eyes, dumbfounded. She never imagined that the gentle young man in the park was actually an unimaginably powerful expert! In her moment of bewilderment, her daughter Xiao Yi broke free from her grasp and ran up to Ye Xiao.</p><p></p><p>"Uncle, are you a deity?" Xiao Yi asked with pure innocence, her eyes wide open.</p><p></p><p>Ye Xiao paused for a moment, then crouched down and gently patted Xiao Yi's head.</p><p></p><p>"Uncle is not a deity, I'm just a martial artist," he said.</p><p></p><p>"Then can you teach me to be a martial artist too?" Xiao Yi asked eagerly.</p><p></p><p>Xiao Yi's mother snapped out of her daze, quickly stepping forward and pulling Xiao Yi back.</p><p></p><p>"Xiao Yi, don't be so rude. The senior is a highly respected figure, you shouldn't behave so impolitely in front of him." She then hurriedly bowed to Ye Xiao and apologized, "Senior, I'm sorry, Xiao Yi is still young and doesn't know any better. Please don't blame her."</p><p></p><p>Ye Xiao smiled. "It's fine, she's quite cute."</p><p></p><p>After a pause, his expression turned serious as he spoke again, "You all can leave now."</p><p></p><p>"Oh, okay!" Xiao Yi's mother immediately obediently picked up Xiao Yi and left.</p><p></p><p>The other people also dared not say much more, following behind Xiao Yi's mother.</p><p></p><p>But as they passed by Ye Xiao, each one of them deeply bowed towards him.</p><p></p><p>If it weren't for Ye Xiao, most of them would have already died.</p><p></p><p>Ye Xiao's expression remained calm, neither overly moved nor overly guilty.</p><p></p><p>It was true that Luofeng City had fallen into this state because he had let Jifeng go, but if he hadn't come, Noel Fei might have already been rescued, and Jifeng would not have gone to Jiahei City, so Luofeng City would have still fallen victim to the star beasts' attack, and no one would have been revived.</p><p></p><p>Now that he had come and dealt with Jifeng, he had saved everyone, so in a sense, he had done a service to Luofeng City.</p><p></p><p>They were right to bow to him.</p><p></p><p>Looking at the empty street, Ye Xiao let out a heavy breath, his gaze turning sharp.</p><p></p><p>Then, with a thought, a towering sword beam thousands of feet high formed above him.</p><p></p><p>"Open!" he uttered the single word, and the sword beam, as if obeying an order, came crashing down onto the ground with a thunderous roar.</p><p></p><p>Boom! The entire street was instantly split open by Ye Xiao.</p><p></p><p>A massive sword scar over a thousand feet long, twenty meters wide, and a hundred meters deep appeared before him. Beneath it was scorching lava - not the magma layer below, but the resting place of the fallen Phoenix's seal. The prolonged exposure to the Phoenix's spiritual energy had turned all the rocks into molten lava.</p><p></p><p>This tremendous commotion naturally attracted the attention of several powerful experts in Luofeng City, but they were all preoccupied with fighting the star beasts, so they could not come over immediately.</p><p></p><p>"Who did this?" </p><p>"Where did this incredibly powerful expert come from in our Luofeng City?"</p><p>"Such a terrifying sword intent, only a grand master could unleash this."</p><p>"Amazing! Truly amazing!"</p><p></p><p>Ye Xiao was unaware of these praises, and even if he knew, he would have been indifferent to them. What he was interested in was the ball of spiritual essence in the lava below - it was enveloping a figure resembling a bird.</p><p></p><p>At this moment, the figure was frantically absorbing the power within the spiritual essence, almost having drained it completely.</p><p></p><p>Ye Xiao did not disrupt this, but watched the scene below with great interest, as Jifeng continued to absorb the Phoenix bloodline.</p><p></p><p>The best dishes require the finest ingredients. The higher the quality of the ingredients, the more tender the meat, the smoother the texture, and the more delicious the taste.</p><p></p><p>Jifeng was merely a minor dragon-level bloodline, and it was only through her long cultivation that she had broken through to the Immortal Sage realm at the seventh grade.</p><p></p><p>So her "meat" was not yet of high enough quality.</p><p></p><p>But after absorbing the Phoenix bloodline, her "meat" would undoubtedly rise to an entirely new level.</p><p></p><p>When eating chicken, one must eat the best.</p><p></p><p>10, 9, 8, 7... As Ye Xiao silently counted down the last seconds in his mind, the ball of spiritual essence suddenly exploded.</p><p></p><p>Boom! With the explosion of the spiritual essence, a phoenix's cry pierced the sky.</p><p></p><p>"Clang!" A sharp sound rapidly spread out, piercing the eardrums of countless people and star beasts within moments, causing the martial artists and star beasts engaged in battle to experience excruciating headaches, rendering them unable to continue fighting.</p><p></p><p>This was the majestic power of the remnant Phoenix bloodline, intertwined with a trace of the ancient Phoenix's might. Only such an ancient species could possess this overwhelming divine aura.</p><p></p><p>The entire Luofeng City was affected, except for Ye Xiao, whose eyes gleamed as he stared intently at the Jifeng soaring into the sky.</p><p></p><p>At this moment, Jifeng had become...</p><p></p><p>Here is the full English translation of the Chinese excerpt:</p><p></p><p>Everything has completely changed. Her entire body of feathers has retreated, replaced by a golden, shimmering set of feathers.</p><p></p><p>Could this be the legendary "Chicken, you are so beautiful"? Ye Xiao compared her previous feathers to the new ones.</p><p></p><p>Her previous feathers were only slightly better than the scales of a black snake. A single feather could be used to create a top-tier weapon by a master craftsman.</p><p></p><p>But now, her feathers can be used to forge imperial-grade weapons.</p><p></p><p>It seems that after absorbing the essence of the Phoenix, her physical body has undergone a tremendous improvement.</p><p></p><p>Her flesh and blood must have also been greatly enhanced.</p><p></p><p>Jifeng did not know that she had been targeted by Ye Xiao, and that after obtaining the remnant essence of the Phoenix, her bloodline had been cleansed and elevated to the dragon-level.  She was so excited that she was beside herself.</p><p></p><p>"Hahaha! I've finally refined my dragon-level bloodline! From now on, I will be a true dragon-level spirit beast, capable of reaching even higher realms.</p><p></p><p>You brats in Jianghai City and Noel Fiss, just wait. I will make you pay the price!"</p><p></p><p>However, just as she finished speaking, her gaze inadvertently fell upon the massive gash on the ground.</p><p></p><p>In her excitement, she had only thought about soaring into the sky, completely unaware of the appearance of the huge slash mark on the ground.</p><p></p><p>"What is this slash mark?"</p><p></p><p>She followed the mark to its end, and the next moment, the chicken was completely dumbfounded.</p><p></p><p>She vigorously rubbed her eyes with her wings, stretched her neck, and looked again carefully.</p><p></p><p>"This... how is he here? Could it be that my obsession has caused me to hallucinate?"</p><p></p><p>After saying this, she slapped herself hard.</p><p></p><p>"Ouch! That hurt!"</p><p></p><p>Having just obtained the Phoenix bloodline, her strength had increased significantly, and she momentarily lost control of it.</p><p></p><p>But when she shook her head and looked back again, Ye Xiao was still down below, and she began to panic completely.</p><p></p><p>"Hahaha, hahaha, hahaha!"</p><p></p><p>Even though Ye Xiao couldn't understand her language, he could guess what Jifeng was saying.</p><p></p><p>Fuck, fuck, fuck, fuck, fuck, fuck!</p><p></p><p>"Flee!"</p><p></p><p>Without any further ado, Jifeng flapped her wings and fled.</p><p></p><p>This guy is a nightmare.</p><p></p><p>The torment of that night, she could never forget!</p><p></p><p>That night, he had severely injured her.</p><p>That night, he had trampled on her dignity.</p><p>That night, he had left her with an unforgettable memory! In the nights of her escape from Jianghai City, whenever it was deep at night and quiet, she would always be able to recall the bestial and inhumane things he had done to her. Every time she thought about it, she wished she could tear him to pieces and devour him alive.</p><p></p><p>But she knew that even though she had a thousand desires to kill him, at least at this moment, she could not kill him.</p><p></p><p>She had already obtained the essence of the Phoenix and elevated her bloodline. In the future, she would surely be able to cultivate enough strength to deal with him.</p><p></p><p>If she was captured by him now, she would be doomed.</p><p></p><p>So she had to flee, flee as far away as possible.</p><p></p><p>Her speed was very fast, especially after obtaining the essence of the Phoenix, her speed had increased even further. A distance of tens of kilometers could be covered in an instant.</p><p></p><p>After fleeing for dozens of miles, she looked back, and fortunately, Ye Xiao had not followed. Probably his speed couldn't keep up with hers, right?</p><p></p><p>After all, cultivation level does not equate to speed. As a bird-type spirit beast, her bloodline inherently possessed agile movement techniques, and her speed was far beyond that of a human martial artist of the same level.</p><p></p><p>Hahaha, I've finally escaped! When I've cultivated enough, I'll go back to Jianghai City and take my revenge for that humiliation!</p><p></p><p>"Perfect!"</p><p></p><p>But just as she uttered these two words, a sword beam flashed across the sky.</p><p></p><p>Swoosh! Her head was instantly severed.</p><p></p><p>As her head was spinning in the air, she saw Ye Xiao standing proudly in the starry sky, smiling at her, his hand still in the motion of swinging the sword.</p><p></p><p>How... how did he do that? How could he be so fast? With this question, Jifeng's consciousness sank into darkness.</p><p></p><p>At this moment, the phone in Ye Xiao's pocket began to vibrate.</p><p></p><p>"I love you, you love me..."</p><p></p><p>Ye Xiao opened the phone, it was a call from Gu Hai.</p><p></p><p>"Hello."</p><p></p><p>"Hey, Ye Xiao, you took leave and went out of town, but you didn't even tell me."</p><p></p><p>"I had some urgent matters to attend to."</p><p></p><p>"I just finished my shift and realized it's Mid-Autumn Festival today. I wanted to ask if you'd like to come to our place for dinner. It's the Mid-Autumn Festival, you shouldn't be alone. I didn't know you went out of town."</p><p></p><p>Ye Xiao was taken aback. Today is the Mid-Autumn Festival?</p><p></p><p>After being alone for so long, he had almost forgotten that today was the Mid-Autumn Festival.</p><p></p><p>At this special moment with memories, he wondered how his loved ones back in his distant hometown were doing.</p><p></p><p>"Thank you, I almost forgot. Happy Mid-Autumn Festival."</p><p></p><p>"Happy Mid-Autumn Festival."</p><p></p><p>"By the way, about you wanting me to be your daughter's godfather, does that still count?"</p><p></p><p>"Hehe, other than you, who else could be my son's godfather?"</p><p></p><p>"Alright then, I'll take on the role of your goddaughter."</p><p></p><p>"You bastard, I'm definitely going to have a son!"</p><p></p><p>Three in the morning, nine thousand words.</p><p></p><p>Happy Mid-Autumn Festival!</p><p></p><p>Thank you to the readers Xiao Xiao Yun Xian and 20190205214315600 for your donations, I'm deeply grateful.</p><p></p><p>(This chapter is complete)</p>

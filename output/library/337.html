        <h1>Chapter 337</h1>
        <div class="content">
            <p>Here is the full English translation of the Chinese excerpt:</p><p></p><p>Ye Xiao instantly vanished from the original spot, and reappeared once again beside his opponent.</p><p></p><p>The Fissure Star Fist was unleashed, the powerful force causing the spiritual energy to distort and form a rapidly spinning vortex on his arm, which was then viciously slammed towards Lin Qingbei.</p><p></p><p>Lin Qingbei's speed was not as fast as Ye Xiao's, but his combat experience was extremely rich.</p><p></p><p>Relying on this abundant combat experience, he was able to accurately predict where Ye Xiao's fist would land.</p><p></p><p>When Ye Xiao's fist arrived, his own fist was already there, colliding with Ye Xiao's fist once again.</p><p></p><p>Then the second punch, the third punch, the fourth punch - each of Ye Xiao's Fissure Star Fists were infused with an unshakable belief in victory, carrying the thunderous force, unstoppable.</p><p></p><p>Each of these attacks could easily grind a huge mountain into powder, and the force could even continue to smash the ground into a chasm a thousand feet deep! And the speed had reached a level that even a transcendent divine being would have difficulty keeping up with.</p><p></p><p>But each attack was blocked by Lin Qingbei relying on his keen combat experience.</p><p></p><p>What surprised Ye Xiao even more was Lin Qingbei's fists. They were actually able to withstand his attacks.</p><p></p><p>It must be known that his attacks were divine arts, the Fissure Star Fist! Yet the other party's fists remained unharmed, indicating that he had also cultivated the same technique.</p><p></p><p>Was the other party's fist technique also a divine art?</p><p></p><p>No!</p><p></p><p>The technique he cultivated was not a divine art!</p><p></p><p>At least his fist technique was not a divine art, because if it were a divine art, the fluctuations generated from clashing with his own would be far more powerful by a hundredfold! It was a body tempering art! The other party's body tempering art had reached the divine art level.</p><p></p><p>Since his body tempering art had already reached the divine art level, even if the fist technique he displayed was only an imperial art, his body would at least not be injured by his attacks.</p><p></p><p>It seems that the person behind him was truly extraordinary, actually passing on such a good technique to him.</p><p></p><p>However, the stronger he was, the more delighted Ye Xiao became! Because Ye Xiao had not encountered an opponent who could match him for a very, very long time.</p><p></p><p>Or to be more precise, since he had cultivated, he had never really fought with full strength before.</p><p></p><p>Punching Lin Qingbei again, Ye Xiao used a clever trick. At the moment of the fist collision, he used his other hand to execute the Pluck Star Hand, grabbing Lin Qingbei's other wrist, and concentrated the force in his foot to unleash the Rend Heaven Strike.</p><p></p><p>Because his Three Doors Leg Technique had not yet formed into a divine art, he could only use an imperial art level technique for now.</p><p></p><p>However, even so, this move disrupted the other party's rhythm.</p><p></p><p>The powerful leg technique directly kicked the opponent away, and the next moment, a Heaven-Cleaving Slash was unleashed.</p><p></p><p>The massive sword beam instantly spread out for tens of thousands of feet, without Ye Xiao even needing to swing the sword, he directly struck the opponent's chin with the sword tip.</p><p></p><p>In the black clouds, it was as if a light snake had suddenly shot out, rushing towards the opponent's throat.</p><p></p><p>Boom! Accompanied by a violent explosion, Lin Qingbei was once again blasted into the black clouds, and this time, he was sent flying back even faster.</p><p></p><p>Ye Xiao's mind moved, and he executed the Yin-Yang Escape Technique, appearing beside Lin Qingbei in the next moment.</p><p></p><p>At this time, Lin Qingbei's chin had already been pierced through by the previous sword strike, leaving a bloody hole, and the golden fresh blood was continuously dripping out. But he had cultivated a body tempering art that might contain a healing art, so the wound quickly began to heal.</p><p></p><p>Only, it did not recover as fast as with Ye Xiao's Eternal Life Sutra.</p><p></p><p>Lin Qingbei was also very stubborn and did not pause his attacks due to the pain.</p><p></p><p>When Ye Xiao arrived in front of him, his palm struck down towards Ye Xiao.</p><p></p><p>Ye Xiao responded with a palm strike as well.</p><p></p><p>The Descending Divine Palm! This time, Lin Qingbei was not as fortunate.</p><p></p><p>Ye Xiao's previous attacks had already exhausted him, and just after being pierced through the chin by Ye Xiao's sword, this palm strike was slightly off-center.</p><p></p><p>And this slight deviation allowed Ye Xiao to break through his palm, and the palm force continued, directly imprinting on Lin Qingbei's chest.</p><p></p><p>Boom! Even with his cultivation of the divine art body tempering technique, Lin Qingbei could not withstand this palm strike.</p><p></p><p>That body cultivated with the divine art body tempering technique was also imprinted with a clear palm print, nearly two inches deep, and he also coughed up a mouthful of fresh blood, being blasted away once again.</p><p></p><p>However, this time, before Ye Xiao could catch up, Lin Qingbei made a hand seal, and in the next moment, the black clouds surged, forming a massive vortex that rapidly rotated in the sky, with a diameter exceeding a hundred thousand feet!</p><p></p><p>Due to the rapid rotation, the vision inside was completely obscured.</p><p></p><p>Even more so, since this place inherently contained Lin Qingbei's dense demonic aura and the scent of the star beasts, it made it even more difficult to discern.</p><p></p><p>Ye Xiao activated the Grand Celestial Divine Might, wanting to use spiritual power to explore, but sensed multiple images of Lin Qingbei.</p><p></p><p>"It's useless. Trying to use spiritual power to sense my position, you are greatly mistaken.</p><p></p><p>The black cloud I prepared before coming was precisely to prevent you from using spiritual power to explore.</p><p></p><p>This black cloud can interfere with spiritual power, even an imperial art level spiritual power technique would not be able to manifest here.</p><p></p><p>I have to admit, your [Fissure Star Fist] is indeed formidable, but..."</p><p></p><p>Here is the full English translation of the Chinese excerpt:</p><p></p><p>"Changqiang, you are the strongest person I have ever seen among the human race! I have always respected the strong, and if you were not human or not from this world, perhaps we could have become good friends.</p><p></p><p>But now, I will send you on your way.</p><p></p><p>To show my respect for you, I will use my strongest technique to send you on your way directly."</p><p></p><p>Afterwards, all that remained in the black clouds was the howling of the fierce wind.</p><p></p><p>Ye Xiao did not say much, he simply raised his right hand, and a flash of light appeared, revealing a large dragon in his hand. In the black clouds, a gaze flickered, seemingly surprised that he had brought out a weapon.</p><p></p><p>But that gaze quickly turned fierce, without a trace of other scattered thoughts.</p><p></p><p>So what if he had a weapon? Ye Xiao could not find his own position, and he was doomed to die.</p><p></p><p>The black clouds were spinning more and more violently, with the speed doubling every second.</p><p></p><p>Finally, when the speed of the black clouds exceeded the speed of lightning, the small space where Ye Xiao stood, no force could possibly escape from this black cloud.</p><p></p><p>In other words, the opponent had locked down the position where Ye Xiao stood, and then proceeded to execute their next attack.</p><p></p><p>That attack would be a lethal full-force attack! He has made his move!</p><p></p><p>The power of this black cloud not only restrained Ye Xiao's power, but also enhanced the opponent's power.</p><p></p><p>Between this positive and negative, the speed difference between him and Ye Xiao had also greatly narrowed.</p><p></p><p>This was a carefully prepared strike for Ye Xiao, with the purpose of sending him to hell.</p><p></p><p>As long as he defeated Ye Xiao, the human race of the Nine Provinces would no longer have the power to resist, and he could enter the Nine Provinces through the gate of the Great Wall Formation, slaughter everywhere, and devour all the bloodlines of the Xuanyuan Clan.</p><p></p><p>The outcome of the battle between masters is decided in an instant.</p><p></p><p>Just as he felt he was about to kill Ye Xiao, his body had already arrived at Ye Xiao's right side.</p><p></p><p>All his power was concentrated in his right fist.</p><p></p><p>This punch, he wanted to shatter Ye Xiao's temple, destroy his spiritual intelligence, and then tear apart his body, killing him completely and then devouring him.</p><p></p><p>However, just as he thought everything had become a foregone conclusion, Ye Xiao moved.</p><p></p><p>The speed was extremely fast, unbelievably fast!</p><p></p><p>But his body did not move.</p><p></p><p>He just raised his hand!</p><p></p><p>Then he swung the large dragon in his hand towards the right side.</p><p></p><p>With just that one swing, the black clouds in the sky were instantly split open.</p><p></p><p>Lin Qingbei's advancing figure was also instantly stopped.</p><p></p><p>The power in his fist also dissipated in an instant.</p><p></p><p>His body was split in two by Ye Xiao's sword! "Pu chi—!"</p><p></p><p>He coughed up a mouthful of fresh blood, struggling to keep his body from falling, looking at Ye Xiao with disbelief on his face.</p><p></p><p>"How did you determine my position? Spiritual power cannot operate in this black cloud, and your spiritual power that I just sensed was imperial art, not the divine art that transcends imperial art!</p><p></p><p>How did you do it?"</p><p></p><p>Ye Xiao slightly turned his neck and tilted his head, looking at Lin Qingbei.</p><p></p><p>Lin Qingbei looked at those yin-yang distinct pupils, first startled, then chuckled, as if admitting defeat, lowering his head.</p><p></p><p>"Impressive! Truly impressive! I didn't expect you to have also cultivated the legendary eye technique! My black cloud can shield spiritual power and the vision of ordinary martial artists, but it cannot shield the eye technique!</p><p></p><p>To encounter a freak like you, I have lost this battle without regret."</p><p></p><p>Ye Xiao actually respected him quite a bit as well.</p><p></p><p>If he didn't use the large dragon, he could still defeat Lin Qingbei, but it might have taken a little longer.</p><p></p><p>Lin Qingbei's divine art level body refining technique was very strong, different from the Great Perfection Divine Body. The Great Perfection Divine Body focuses on constantly improving one's aptitude. His body refining technique not only was extremely tough, but also had the ability to rapidly self-heal.</p><p></p><p>The reason he ultimately used the large dragon was because Ye Xiao sensed another threat, so he had to end this battle prematurely.</p><p></p><p>It wasn't a thoroughly satisfying fight, but he had no choice.</p><p></p><p>At this moment, terrifying auras were erupting one after another in the starry sky, as the experts of the major clans descended and were ruthlessly slaughtering the star beasts!</p><p></p><p>Even though they were very far away, Ye Xiao could almost hear the agonizing cries of those star beasts.</p><p></p><p>That desperate wailing.</p><p></p><p>"It seems the clan experts have arrived."</p><p></p><p>Lin Qingbei sighed softly, then looked at Ye Xiao and spoke again:</p><p></p><p>"I don't know who the young master is, but he rescued me when I was very young, and imparted divine art knowledge to me, allowing me to cultivate without suffering bullying from others.</p><p></p><p>He knows a lot of knowledge and is extremely terrifying.</p><p></p><p>In the past, the star beasts in this world only naturally plundered the divine blood of the human race, but later, he demanded that we plunder the divine blood within the human race's bodies and offer it to him."</p><p></p><p>"What does he look like?"</p>

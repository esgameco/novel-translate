        <h1>Chapter 119</h1>
        <div class="content">
            <p>Here is the full English translation of the Chinese excerpt:</p><p></p><p>Lu Wanwan's mother was also there, constantly wiping her daughter's forehead.</p><p></p><p>"Little Ye has arrived!"</p><p></p><p>Gu Father called out a greeting, and Ye Xiao nodded and walked up to the bedside.</p><p></p><p>"What happened?"</p><p></p><p>Lu Mother spoke up:</p><p></p><p>"While walking, she sprained her foot, her body jerked, and the fetal movement was intense. The doctor has used healing magic and combined it with pregnancy-stabilizing medicine to alleviate it, but the effect is not great. They said a doctor from the neighboring city who specializes in pregnancy preservation and healing has been summoned, but they're worried the baby won't make it."</p><p></p><p>Gu Father and Gu Mother kept blaming themselves.</p><p></p><p>"It's all our fault. If only one of us had been with Wanwan."</p><p></p><p>Although in great discomfort, Lu Wanwan still comforted them:</p><p></p><p>"Dad, Mom, don't blame yourselves. You have the store to run and meals to cook. It was my own carelessness. Besides, don't you always say I have a lucky star? I'm sure everything will be fine."</p><p></p><p>Lu Mother quickly interjected:</p><p></p><p>"At a time like this, you still have the heart to comfort others? You should just rest and save your energy."</p><p></p><p>Lu Wanwan nodded.</p><p></p><p>Ye Xiao did not waste words, but with a sweep of the Taixuan Tiangong, he understood - Lu Wanwan and the baby's umbilical cord had been injured. </p><p></p><p>Because the wound was on a small blood vessel, it kept bleeding. </p><p></p><p>With the healing abilities of the doctors at Jianghai City Hospital, combined with medication, they still lacked the capability to stop the bleeding. The damage to the umbilical cord was causing insufficient oxygen supply to the baby, like a drowning person, naturally leading to the fetal kicking and struggling.</p><p></p><p>Given the current situation, in less than three minutes the baby would start suffocating, leading to hypoxic brain damage and certain death.</p><p></p><p>It's a good thing he came.</p><p></p><p>With a slight movement of his mind, he directly employed the补天术 (补天Shu) to repair the umbilical cord, and also helped the baby recover from the discomfort caused by the lack of oxygen. The baby soon settled down.</p><p></p><p>Lu Wanwan was stunned for a moment, then exclaimed in surprise: "The baby has stopped kicking!"</p><p></p><p>Lu Mother was startled.</p><p></p><p>"How could the baby suddenly stop kicking? Quick, call the doctor!"</p><p></p><p>The baby, who had been violently kicking, suddenly became still, which was even more frightening than the kicking. Gu Father and Gu Mother were about to go call the doctor when several doctors in white coats quickly rushed in.</p><p></p><p>One of the younger doctors, wiping the sweat from his brow, smiled and said, "Uncle Gu, you're in luck. Professor Guo just happened to be on a business trip to our Jianghai City, so he didn't have to come from out of town. With him here, you don't need to worry."</p><p></p><p>Gu Father's eyes lit up as he exclaimed in delight:</p><p></p><p>"Professor Guo? Is that the renowned expert in women's and children's medicine in the Nine States?"</p><p></p><p>The young doctor nodded.</p><p></p><p>"That's him! His level in women's and children's medicine can be considered one of the top few in the Nine States, and even among the best in the world.</p><p></p><p>With him here, Lu Sister will definitely be fine."</p><p></p><p>The eyes of Gu Father and Gu Mother were rekindled with hope as they looked at the other expectantly.</p><p></p><p>Professor Guo wasted no time in walking up, placing his hand on Lu Wanwan's wrist to examine her. </p><p></p><p>However, after just a few seconds, his expression suddenly darkened, and he let go of Lu Wanwan's hand and turned to leave.</p><p></p><p>"Outrageous! Absolutely outrageous!"</p><p></p><p>Everyone's hearts sank again.</p><p></p><p>"Professor Guo, what's wrong?"</p><p></p><p>Professor Guo glared fiercely at the young doctor.</p><p></p><p>"She's fine, the baby's fine, the fetal movement is normal, the baby is normal, there's nothing unusual, yet you tell me it's so serious and have me rush over from the train station to..."</p><p></p><p>Here is the full English translation of the Chinese excerpt:</p><p></p><p>"You rushed all the way to this ward, are you trying to trick me?" </p><p></p><p>The young doctor was taken aback.</p><p></p><p>"No, no, not at all!"</p><p></p><p>"Hmph! Enough with the riddles, I will personally talk to your hospital director about this matter!" With that, Professor Guo angrily left, and the other doctors hurriedly followed him.</p><p></p><p>"Professor Guo, let me explain."</p><p></p><p>Gu's father, Gu's mother, and Lu's mother all had confused expressions on their faces.</p><p></p><p>"Strange! Could it really be nothing? Didn't the other doctors just say the problem was very serious when they examined her?"</p><p></p><p>Lu Wanwan smiled and said, "It should be fine, after all, everyone has heard of Professor Guo's name, he is a leading figure in the medical field of the Nine States, he couldn't have made a mistake on such a small matter."</p><p></p><p>"Probably, but regardless, it's good that there was no danger."</p><p></p><p>The group turned from worry to joy, only Ye Xiao remained largely unchanged.</p><p></p><p>Because he knew what had happened.</p><p></p><p>That Professor Guo's level was indeed impressive, Ye Xiao remembered reading an introduction about him in the library.</p><p></p><p>But his Supplementing the Heavens technique was simply too powerful!</p><p></p><p>The Supplementing the Heavens technique was an imperial-level healing art, able to repair injuries, far beyond what the other party could match.</p><p></p><p>It could perfectly treat Lu Wanwan, leaving no trace of her previous injury.</p><p></p><p>This resulted in him being unable to detect any injury when he took her pulse or examined her with spiritual power. "Since there's nothing wrong, then I'll head back first."</p><p></p><p>"Okay, thank you for coming all this way."</p><p></p><p>"Uncle, you're too polite, I'm Gu Hai's good friend, it's only natural."</p><p></p><p>"Let me see you out."</p><p></p><p>"No need, you all just focus on taking care of Wanwan, I have some other matters to attend to."</p><p></p><p>"Alright then."</p><p></p><p>Seeing that he had other matters, Gu's father did not insist on seeing him off.</p><p></p><p>In fact, Ye Xiao did have something to attend to.</p><p></p><p>Because just now, while healing Lu Wanwan, his spiritual power had suddenly detected two unusual auras!</p><p></p><p>The aura of a demihuman!</p><p></p><p>...</p><p></p><p>At this time, in the alley behind the hospital, Huan Liuli was crouching on a wall, pondering her life as a beast.</p><p></p><p>Given the current situation, it would be difficult for her to deal with Ye Xiao, which meant she couldn't possibly escape his control.</p><p></p><p>This abnormal Ye Xiao, with his many techniques, high cultivation, and powerful strength, was a well-rounded talent.</p><p></p><p>And his development was also very rapid.</p><p></p><p>This won't do, but what method can I use to help myself defeat Ye Xiao ahead of time?</p><p></p><p>While she was struggling with this, suddenly her cat body trembled, and her gaze instantly became sharp, looking towards the corner of the alley.</p><p></p><p>"Who's there? Come out!"</p><p></p><p>"Hehe...no wonder you are a dragon-level bloodline beast, your strength is indeed formidable, you immediately detected our hiding place."</p><p></p><p>The next moment, two figures emerged from the corner.</p><p></p><p>Huan Liuli looked at them with great vigilance.</p><p></p><p>"Demihumans?"</p><p></p><p>"That's right, we have been ordered by the Holy Envoy to come and bring you back, Huan Liuli, the Phantom Cat."</p><p></p><p>Huan Liuli's cat body trembled, and a layer of mist instantly covered her eyes! After more than fifty years! Finally, finally, a beast organization has come to take her back!</p><p></p><p>"Why did you come so late? Do you know how I've been living for the past fifty-plus years?"</p><p></p><p>This is the first part, more to come.</p>

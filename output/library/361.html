        <h1>Chapter 361</h1>
        <div class="content">
            <p>Here is the full English translation of the Chinese excerpt:</p><p></p><p>"What's going on?" </p><p></p><p>Ning Zhiyuan's mind was immersed in the ring, a high-end spatial storage ring that often possessed not just one but various capabilities - defense, offense, information transmission, and more.</p><p></p><p>The gemstone on the ring immediately manifested a beautiful female apparition, his maidservant.</p><p></p><p>"Young Master Ning, there's an emergency."</p><p></p><p>Ning Zhiyuan's eyes narrowed.</p><p></p><p>"Is it the other three divine clans?"</p><p></p><p>"No, it's not them. We obtained a message from a tomb in the Deicide Realm - there is a Sage King's tomb in this star domain."</p><p></p><p>"What did you say?" </p><p></p><p>Ning Zhiyuan's expression instantly turned grave.</p><p></p><p>A Sage King's tomb was no small matter. Even an existence like the Ning Clan would be tempted by it. </p><p></p><p>Below the Sage Emperors, the Sage Kings reigned supreme. The Ning Clan was only a direct lineage of the Xuanyuan Divine Clan, not the most orthodox branch, so their highest cultivators were three Sage King experts. The resources within a Sage King's tomb would be unimaginably vast.</p><p></p><p>"I'll head over immediately. Have everyone keep this news completely sealed - no one is allowed to discuss it. If anyone dares to do so, execute them on the spot!"</p><p></p><p>"Yes, Young Master!"</p><p></p><p>Ning Zhiyuan teleported outside the library, and the steward's figure emerged from the distorted air.</p><p></p><p>"Young Master, what's happening?"</p><p></p><p>Ning Zhiyuan's expression was extremely grave as he said, "A major event has occurred. We've obtained information about a Sage King's tomb."</p><p></p><p>"What? A Sage King's tomb?"</p><p></p><p>Even the steward, an existence above the Divine Realm, couldn't help but have his breath caught and his heartbeat quicken, his eyes gleaming.</p><p></p><p>But his expression soon turned grave as well. A Sage King's tomb was no laughing matter. It represented vast resources and opportunities, but also immense danger. A Sage King's tomb could make countless powers envious and even start a war over it.</p><p></p><p>If this was true, the Ning Clan had to make preparations quickly. While the Thunder Divine Clan, Wing Divine Clan, and Giant Ape Divine Clan might currently refrain from acting due to fearing the Xuanyuan Divine Clan's strength, once they learned of the Sage King's tomb, the situation would change drastically.</p><p></p><p>"If the information about the Sage King's tomb came from the Deicide Realm tomb we excavated, they might have also obtained the same news, since there are likely similar-level tombs in their territories."</p><p></p><p>Ning Zhiyuan stared at the sky. "That's the better scenario. What if they've already excavated the Sage King's tomb?"</p><p></p><p>The steward's heart trembled. If that was the case, it would be a huge disaster. The resources in a Sage King's tomb had a high chance of forging a new Sage King, as the path to reaching Sage King Realm was extremely arduous, but with those resources, it would be much easier.</p><p></p><p>"Young Master, we must urgently request aid from the Ning Clan. They must send more troops. If the other three clans obtain the Sage King's tomb and cultivate a Sage King expert, it will be a massive loss for our Ning Clan."</p><p></p><p>"I know. The Ning Clan must send troops, but before they arrive, we must find the Sage King's tomb first and guard it strictly."</p><p></p><p>"Mobilize the earthbound warriors?"</p><p></p><p>"Starting today, reduce the review process and lower the standards for going to the starry sky. Above Grand Master, they can all go to the starry sky. There are so many divine tombs in the starry sky, even if we send more people, they won't be able to excavate them all at once. And compared to a Sage King's tomb, those divine tombs are nothing."</p><p></p><p>"The Young Master is wise."</p><p></p><p>The two figures quickly transformed into beams of light and vanished into the air.</p><p></p><p>After they left, Ye Xiao couldn't help but raise his eyebrows slightly.</p><p></p><p>"So they've already found news of a Sage King's tomb in the starry sky." </p><p></p><p>But thinking about it, it wasn't that surprising. These divine tombs were the graves of ancient divine cultivators, so they would naturally contain information about the ancient divine era. If there was a record of a Sage King's tomb, there was nothing strange about that.</p><p></p><p>It seems the time left for him was not much. He could only hope they would find it a bit slower. Because once they found the Sage King's tomb, there was a high chance it would contain information about the Divine Nation's Treasure Trove.</p><p></p><p>Over the next two days, there was another large-scale recruitment on the ground. All the major powers were desperately scrambling for people. As long as one was above Grand Master, they could directly enter the starry sky to start excavating tombs.</p><p></p><p>This made Ye Xiao couldn't help but feel a bit sorry for the ancient divine clans. After all, in the past, it was the Star Beasts who dominated the starry sky battlefields, but they at least weren't interested in tomb excavation. But now with the divine clans arriving, they were really...</p><p></p><p>Here is the full English translation of the Chinese excerpt:</p><p></p><p>The bone fragments had to be dug out and scattered, which was really tragic.</p><p></p><p>What he had dug up was just the treasure vault of the divine kingdom, which should have been the treasures buried in the entire ancient divine kingdom, not people. After two days, Ye Xiao's divine art-level swordplay was finally cultivated to the great perfection realm by the Golden Book divine soul.</p><p></p><p>Looking at the four sheets of paper that had completely turned golden, Ye Xiao's mood was a bit excited, he could start the synthesis now.</p><p></p><p>The Ancient Treasure Art!</p><p></p><p>Even in the entire divine clan, it was the most powerful technique.</p><p></p><p>With the Ancient Treasure Art, his future would definitely be promising.</p><p></p><p>Ye Xiao dared to say that he had a 100% chance of reaching the Divine Emperor realm.</p><p></p><p>He didn't know what kind of Ancient Treasure Art he could synthesize, it was said that the Ancient Treasure Arts also had rankings.</p><p></p><p>If the Ancient Treasure Art he synthesized was ranked too low, it would be very disadvantageous to fight against the high-ranked Ancient Treasure Arts.</p><p></p><p>He hoped the Golden Book divine soul could synthesize an extremely rare and precious Ancient Treasure Art for him.</p><p></p><p>With an anxious heart, Ye Xiao took a deep breath and clicked on the synthesis.</p><p></p><p>The papers recording the four divine arts instantly fused together and combined into one sheet.</p><p></p><p>This sheet of paper was very thick, and Ye Xiao was extremely excited.</p><p></p><p>Just from the thickness of the paper, it gave a very reassuring feeling, this treasure art must be extremely powerful!</p><p></p><p>What would it be like? What would it be called? How powerful would its manifestation be? These questions greatly intrigued Ye Xiao.</p><p></p><p>He couldn't help but breathe a little faster.</p><p></p><p>One second, two seconds, three seconds... After ten seconds, the golden light finally dimmed, revealing the situation inside.</p><p></p><p>Ye Xiao immediately focused his attention.</p><p></p><p>After another second.</p><p></p><p>Ye Xiao: "(...)?!"</p><p></p><p>Seeing the 1% displayed on the page, he fell into deep confusion.</p><p></p><p>That's it?</p><p></p><p>After all that effort! This synthesis still needs a progress bar!</p><p></p><p>What's going on here?</p><p></p><p>It made him get excited for nothing.</p><p></p><p>According to the Golden Book's nature, the time it took to fuse the divine arts was very long, and this time it would probably take even longer.</p><p></p><p>It seems he would have to wait for a while longer.</p><p></p><p>And so, a few more days passed.</p><p></p><p>When the star beasts had already dug out 100 billion divine crystals for Ye Xiao, the treasure art was finally synthesized.</p><p></p><p>When the Golden Book prompted the successful synthesis, Ye Xiao was at work with Gu Hai, and he was quite excited, instantly disappearing from the spot.</p><p></p><p>Gu Hai: "(?`)! Old Ye? Old Ye, where did you go? Old Ye!"</p><p></p><p>Ye Xiao first returned to the dormitory in the library, and he immediately immersed his spiritual sense in the Golden Book divine soul, and the next moment, four big words appeared before his eyes.</p><p></p><p>Annihilation Treasure Art!</p><p></p><p>Ye Xiao's spiritual sense trembled.</p><p></p><p>Wow, just the name sounded incredibly powerful, if it was unleashed, it must be extraordinary.</p><p></p><p>Even if he didn't know the ranking of the treasure art, just seeing this name, he could feel that it must be ranked among the top.</p><p></p><p>Sure enough, the Golden Book divine soul is worthy, every time it makes a move, it's a rare treasure.</p><p></p><p>Ye Xiao looked at it carefully.</p><p></p><p>The Annihilation Treasure Art, under the annihilation, no one can resist, nothing is unbreakable, nothing cannot be destroyed!</p><p></p><p>Controlling all the destructive powers of the world, breaking the existence of any target.</p><p></p><p>The name was domineering, and the introduction was even more domineering.</p><p></p><p>Next, it's just waiting for the Golden Book to cultivate it to the great perfection realm.</p><p></p><p>Ye Xiao's mood, excited but gradually calmed down, his heart also relaxed a bit.</p><p></p><p>"With the first treasure art, there will be the second and third, I wonder what other treasure arts will be synthesized next. If each time I can synthesize such a powerful treasure art, I'm afraid that even if I reach the Divine King realm, I can still contend against the Divine Emperor realm, and after the Divine Emperor realm, I don't know how powerful I will become."</p><p></p><p>A trace of craziness flashed in Ye Xiao's eyes.</p><p></p><p>Could he also create a divine kingdom? Suppress an entire celestial domain? If he reached that point, he should be able to ensure his own life, no longer threatened by anyone, right?</p><p></p><p>Come on!</p><p></p><p>Ye Xiao clenched his fists and cheered himself on in his heart.</p><p></p><p>He glanced at the Golden Book divine soul, and next, he really wanted to cultivate a healing-type divine art, completing the synthesis of healing and body arts.</p><p></p><p>But one thing, Ning Zhiyuan's visit here today gave him a warning.</p><p></p><p>Ning Zhiyuan might not be very strong, but his identity was very special.</p><p></p><p>Ye Xiao heard his conversation with that Ning manager, they should be from a powerful family in the Xuanyuan Divine Clan.</p><p></p><p>They must have even stronger existences behind them.</p><p></p><p>If a Divine King came because of the fight over the Divine King's tomb, and discovered the Kunlun Dragon Vein and the Divine Kingdom Treasure Vault, what would happen? Now with so many star beasts, working day and night, and his own spiritual clone, together they had only dug up less than one-thousandth, and he still needed a long time to be protected.</p><p></p><p>So, he needed to improve his formation art next, synthesize it to the treasure art level, and then use the formation art to shield the Divine Kingdom Treasure Vault, so that it won't be discovered by others.</p>

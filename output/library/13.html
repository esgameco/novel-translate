        <h1>Chapter 13</h1>
        <div class="content">
            <p>Here is the full English translation of the Chinese excerpt:</p><p></p><p>Over the next few days, things were quite ordinary. That Qin Yuyan would occasionally come by to return books, and then borrow one or two books related to swordsmanship.</p><p></p><p>The two of them didn't have much interaction. They were at most acquaintances, not quite friends, and could only manage a few words with each other.</p><p></p><p>This girl seemed to be obsessed with swordsmanship. All her studies were focused on swordsmanship, and even the biographies and ancient legends she read were selected for their content on swordsmanship.</p><p></p><p>It's unclear what had drawn her to this fixation.</p><p></p><p>But Ye Xiao couldn't be bothered to meddle in her affairs. He just focused on his own books, diligently searching for the fundamental cultivation methods.</p><p></p><p>Through his unwavering efforts, a month later, he had finally gathered nine fundamental cultivation methods, and the nine pages recording them on the golden book had begun to emit a faint glow.</p><p></p><p>This meant that as long as he found one or two more fundamental cultivation methods, he would be able to fuse and upgrade them into an exceptionally powerful cultivation technique.</p><p></p><p>At that point, his endurance and stamina would be greatly enhanced. </p><p></p><p>It would be even better than having a portable power bank, because unlike a power bank that needs recharging when depleted, he could directly absorb spiritual energy from the surrounding environment at any time.</p><p></p><p>Moreover, his fundamental sword techniques were also close to being fused and upgraded.</p><p></p><p>Although the last two were always the most difficult to find, it was like the last few drops after urinating - they would eventually come out.</p><p></p><p>Ye Xiao was a person with a sunny and positive mindset. He would enjoy the wait, looking forward to the joy of ultimate success, without complaining or becoming anxious.</p><p></p><p>And that day, it was the day when the professor from the Jingdu Martial Arts University was scheduled to come and give a lecture.</p><p></p><p>Coincidentally, it fell on a Sunday, so Ye Xiao didn't need to take a day off from the Jianghai Martial Arts Institute.</p><p></p><p>The Jianghai Martial Arts Institute was especially lively that day. </p><p></p><p>The day before, the campus had undergone a major cleaning, and banners had been hung up.</p><p></p><p>"Warmly welcome Professor Dou Changfeng from the Jingdu Martial Arts University to give a lecture at our institute."</p><p></p><p>Before 9 o'clock in the morning, a large number of students had gathered at the two sides of the institute's main gate, waiting.</p><p></p><p>In addition, the dean of the Jianghai Martial Arts Institute, Old Qin, was also standing at the gate with a group of teachers, occasionally looking down the road.</p><p></p><p>Ye Xiao didn't want to join the crowd. He just held a fruit drink and watched from the side of the road, waiting to go in after the guests arrived.</p><p></p><p>Soon, with the arrival of several Maybach cars, the crowd began to get excited.</p><p></p><p>"They're here, they're here." Ye Xiao glanced over and saw a middle-aged man in a suit, slightly younger than Old Qin, around 50 years old, getting out of the car.</p><p></p><p>"Old Dou, we've finally been waiting for you!" </p><p></p><p>"Haha, Old Qin, we meet again after more than forty years. Back then, I was the one who sent you to Jingdu!"</p><p></p><p>The two old men embraced each other warmly.</p><p></p><p>Ye Xiao estimated that this professor Dou's cultivation must be extraordinary, as he had completely concealed his aura. Unless Ye Xiao's own strength was far superior, there was no way he could detect it.</p><p></p><p>However, it was said that some rare perception-type cultivation techniques might be able to sense the traces of a master's hidden power.</p><p></p><p>Ye Xiao didn't know if he would ever have the chance to encounter such a technique in his lifetime.</p><p></p><p>Judging from his appearance, Professor Dou was definitely much stronger than Old Qin.</p><p></p><p>The two old men continued chatting and exchanging pleasantries as they walked into the Jianghai Martial Arts Institute.</p><p></p><p>The students at the gate quickly rushed to follow them in. Ye Xiao finished his fruit drink, made a phone call, and followed them inside.</p><p></p><p>"Hello, Old Gu, where have you been? The lecture is about to start."</p><p></p><p>"Uh, well..."</p><p></p><p>Here is the full English translation of the Chinese excerpt:</p><p></p><p>"Old Ye, I have a bit of diarrhea today, you go to the class first, and just come back and tell me about it."</p><p></p><p>"Diarrhea?" Ye Xiao's brow furrowed slightly.</p><p></p><p>A Third-Order Martial Artist has diarrhea? What on earth did he eat to poison a Third-Order Martial Artist?</p><p></p><p>"Ah Hai, come on, the movie is about to start."</p><p></p><p>At this moment, a lazy voice suddenly came through the phone. Ye Xiao was just about to speak when Gu Hai hurriedly said, "That, Old Ye, I'll hang up first, my stomach hurts, oh, I'll hang up first."</p><p></p><p>Before he could finish speaking, he directly hung up the phone.</p><p></p><p>Ye Xiao shook his head helplessly.</p><p></p><p>This guy is really unreliable.</p><p></p><p>He himself did not need to attend the class, he just made an appointment with Gu Hai to come and play, but now that Gu Hai is not coming, he has nothing good to listen to either.</p><p></p><p>"Well, since I'm here, I'll just wander around the campus."</p><p></p><p>Ye Xiao shook his head and walked towards the now empty gate.</p><p></p><p>On the campus, Qin Shenglong and Du Changfeng were walking in front, reminiscing about the past. Behind them were hundreds of teachers and thousands of students, all following silently.</p><p></p><p>All eyes were filled with admiration, envy, and a touch of glory.</p><p></p><p>Because Du Changfeng was not only a renowned master and professor, but also a prominent figure who had emerged from Jiangcheng Martial Arts University.</p><p></p><p>The two arrived at the center of Jianghai Martial Arts Academy and stopped to observe the huge stone in the center.</p><p></p><p>Carved on the stone were some texts, which seemed to be cultivation techniques.</p><p></p><p>On top of the stone stood a stone statue, which looked exactly like Du Changfeng, only younger.</p><p></p><p>"I didn't expect this huge stone to still be here," Du Changfeng's eyes revealed a hint of nostalgia, and Qin Shenglong smiled and said:</p><p></p><p>"Back then, if you hadn't offered the secret inner cultivation technique and saber technique of the Du family, Jiangcheng Martial Arts University would have declined.</p><p></p><p>It can be said that you saved Jianghai Martial Arts Academy.</p><p></p><p>So after I became the dean, the first thing I did was to have your statue made, and the Du family's inner cultivation technique and saber technique carved on the huge stone, so that every student of Jianghai Martial Arts Academy would know and be grateful for your great kindness."</p><p></p><p>Du Changfeng's eyes also revealed a hint of nostalgia.</p><p></p><p>"Compared to the outstanding teachers of Jiangcheng Martial Arts University who went to the front lines and either died or were injured in that year's beast tide, what I did by offering the family's cultivation technique and saber technique is nothing."</p><p></p><p>"Don't say that, they are certainly great, but you went against your family's teachings and offered yourself, which is no less than them."</p><p></p><p>Du Changfeng sighed.</p><p></p><p>"Hearing this makes me ashamed. It was just one cultivation technique and one saber technique. However, I have learned many techniques during my years in the capital. Today, I will leave thirteen extraordinary-level techniques for Jianghai Academy, to contribute one more bit of effort to my alma mater!"</p><p></p><p>Qin Shenglong's eyes lit up.</p><p></p><p>"Good! I've been waiting for you to say that. The classroom is ready, I won't be polite, please go ahead!"</p><p></p><p>Du Changfeng smiled wryly.</p><p></p><p>"You're still so impatient. Okay, I'll go teach the class now."</p><p></p><p>Amid the cheers, the crowd walked into the academy's main lecture hall.</p><p></p><p>After everyone left, Ye Xiao came to the statue and the huge stone.</p><p></p><p>At this moment, the divine soul of the Golden Book within him suddenly stirred.</p>

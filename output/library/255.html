        <h1>Chapter 255</h1>
        <div class="content">
            <p>Here is the full English translation of the Chinese excerpt:</p><p></p><p>"Damn it, retreat!" </p><p></p><p>In an instant, Feng Long reacted and called out to Qingniu to start retreating.</p><p></p><p>But at this moment, an unexpected event suddenly occurred.</p><p></p><p>Just as Feng Long was about to turn and flee, the next second, a huge force suddenly came from his back.</p><p></p><p>It was Qingniu! Damn it! That bastard, actually attacking him from behind at such a critical moment.</p><p></p><p>By suddenly attacking his back like this, Feng Long would lose control of his body in a short time, and naturally he would not be able to escape.</p><p></p><p>And Qingniu took this opportunity to turn into a beam of light and quickly disappear from the original spot.</p><p></p><p>Feng Long cursed Qingniu's ancestors up to the 18th generation in his heart.</p><p></p><p>But even so, he couldn't change the current situation.</p><p></p><p>The distance between him and Jiang Chen was really too close.</p><p></p><p>Even a divine beast strongman might not be able to dodge at this distance, let alone his own cultivation, which had not reached the divine beast realm, but was only a semi-divine beast.</p><p></p><p>Damn it.</p><p></p><p>Reluctantly, he could only unleash his claw technique, releasing attacks with both claws, trying to create a gap between himself and Jiang Chen.</p><p></p><p>Unfortunately, although his strength was powerful, it was simply not enough in the face of a King Realm expert.</p><p></p><p>Jiang Chen directly punched out.</p><p></p><p>Just that simple punch, the powerful force within it caused the surrounding spiritual energy to start distorting.</p><p></p><p>The power of a King Realm expert was truly too strong, far exceeding the limits of ordinary human races and ordinary star beasts. It would not be an exaggeration to call him a new dimensional expert.</p><p></p><p>The energy Feng Long released was instantly shattered.</p><p></p><p>Not only that, his palms, his arms, faced with this extremely powerful force, were directly blasted into a bloody mist.</p><p></p><p>This couldn't go on.</p><p></p><p>If he were to fully take this attack, his physical body might be blasted to pieces.</p><p></p><p>Then he would truly be done for.</p><p></p><p>Even the Tiger God's descent couldn't save him.</p><p></p><p>At the critical moment, he directly unleashed his escape secret art - the Blood Explosion Technique.</p><p></p><p>In an instant, his entire physical body directly exploded into a cloud of blood mist, and this cloud of blood mist immediately dissipated and disappeared from the original spot, no longer existing.</p><p></p><p>Jiang Chen's fist stopped, and he couldn't help but frown slightly.</p><p></p><p>"Well, I didn't expect him to actually have this kind of secret art. The Blood Explosion Technique, once unleashed, can instantly transfer him to another place. But it will also cause his body to suffer great damage.</p><p></p><p>He is really ruthless towards himself, willing to risk serious injury to unleash the Blood Explosion Technique and escape from my fist."</p><p></p><p>Liu Chengxun's heart was stuck in his throat, as if it had stopped beating.</p><p></p><p>So strong!</p><p></p><p>Really so strong!</p><p></p><p>Those were two semi-divine beast level super experts.</p><p></p><p>Existences that could easily crush him like an ant.</p><p></p><p>Yet even so, under Jiang Chen's hand, they couldn't even withstand a single move before retreating.</p><p></p><p>One of them even had to rely on betraying the other to narrowly escape.</p><p></p><p>And the other one had to resort to the Blood Explosion Technique.</p><p></p><p>This was already their limit.</p><p></p><p>But Jiang Chen hadn't even used his own limit.</p><p></p><p>"Dean Jiang, shouldn't you go after them? With your strength, chasing down and killing them after they used the Blood Explosion Technique shouldn't be a problem, right?"</p><p></p><p>But Jiang Chen did not answer his words.</p><p></p><p>Liu Chengxun was right, with his strength, it might be a bit troublesome to catch up to the one who used the Blood Explosion Technique, but catching up to Qingniu would not be a difficult task for him.</p><p></p><p>However, he didn't come here to deal with those two fellows.</p><p></p><p>His true mission was to guard the library behind him.</p><p></p><p>Inside this library, there was something extremely important.</p><p></p><p>If that thing was lost, that would be a real big trouble.</p><p></p><p>So he absolutely couldn't leave the library unattended to chase those two semi-divine beasts.</p><p></p><p>"Forget it. They've already left, and even if I chase them, I might not be able to catch up. After all, there are other strong experts in the Nine States, let them handle it."</p><p></p><p>With that, Jiang Chen turned and entered the library.</p><p></p><p>Before stepping into the library, he silently left a sentence.</p><p></p><p>"I don't want anyone else to know about tonight's events. If a third person finds out, you'll have to bear the consequences yourself."</p><p></p><p>Liu Chengxun's heart trembled, and he immediately spoke up:</p><p></p><p>"Dean, don't worry, I swear on my personal integrity that I will not reveal this matter to anyone. I, Liu Chengxun, have never been a gossip."</p><p></p><p>Jiang Chen nodded and completely entered the library.</p><p></p><p>After Jiang Chen went into the library, Liu Chengxun immediately took out his phone and sent a text message to Ye Xiao.</p><p></p><p>He had never used a phone before, it was his disciple Pang Jiansheng who bought it for him, and it only had Pang Jiansheng and Ye Xiao's phone numbers and WeChat.</p><p></p><p>"Ye Xiao, I have something very important to tell you."</p><p></p><p>"From now on, don't discuss anything related to the new dean. I mean anything!</p><p></p><p>His identity is far more complicated than it appears on the surface.</p><p></p><p>His true identity, to us two, is like the sun and moon in the sky! It's best for us to be cautious.</p><p></p><p>Don't provoke him at all, or you won't even know how you died."</p><p></p><p>Here is my translation of the Chinese excerpt:</p><p></p><p>Suddenly, after typing out the message, he thought of something and deleted all the characters one by one.</p><p></p><p>He was too excited.</p><p></p><p>He almost forgot. He had just promised the librarian that he absolutely could not tell anyone about this matter.</p><p></p><p>At this moment, the phone screen suddenly emitted a message notification sound - it was a message from Ye Xiao.</p><p></p><p>"What's the matter?"</p><p></p><p>"It's nothing, I just wanted to invite you to have a late-night snack, but thinking about it, it's already so late. You must not have time. Forget about it."</p><p></p><p>"I have time."</p><p></p><p>Liu Chengxun: "(Sigh)!"</p><p></p><p>"Forget it, I don't feel like eating anymore."</p><p></p><p>On the other side, Feng Long gradually condensed his body out of the darkness.</p><p></p><p>"Phew!"</p><p></p><p>He exhaled a mouthful of turbid air, and his complexion immediately relaxed a lot.</p><p></p><p>"Damn that Blue Ox, it almost killed me. Fortunately, I have the Blood Explosion Technique, which can instantly teleport me to another place.</p><p></p><p>Otherwise, that guy's punch just now would have probably sent me straight to the afterlife."</p><p></p><p>But at this moment, a familiar voice suddenly sounded in his ear.</p><p></p><p>"Feng Long! Aren't you Feng Long? How did you get in here too?"</p><p></p><p>Feng Long: "?!"</p><p></p><p>This voice, why did it sound so familiar?</p><p></p><p>He turned his head to look, and his expression immediately became dumbfounded.</p><p></p><p>What's going on? Where did he transfer to? Why are there so many star beasts here? And they are all at the Divine Ancestor level of strength? Could it be that he has suddenly transferred to the Star Battlefield? No, his Blood Explosion Technique is only for short-distance teleportation, how could it possibly achieve long-distance teleportation? This is not the Star Battlefield.</p><p></p><p>At this time, he also noticed Sai Mu'er, Susan, Mo Yu, and Iron Ox.</p><p></p><p>"I've finally found you all. Why are you all gathered here? The Tiger God has called you many times, why haven't you answered? And who are they? You guys, are you trying to betray the Tiger God?"</p><p></p><p>Feng Long asked a series of questions with a cold face.</p><p></p><p>But at this time, no one answered him.</p><p></p><p>The star beasts just looked at him with a blank and pitiful expression, and their eyes also had a hint of confusion.</p><p></p><p>Seeing that they didn't speak, Feng Long's expression became even worse.</p><p></p><p>"Sai Mu'er, why don't you answer me?"</p><p></p><p>Sai Mu'er sighed and slowly spoke:</p><p></p><p>"I want to ask, did you encounter a super strong expert? An extremely powerful human?"</p><p></p><p>Feng Long nodded.</p><p></p><p>"So what?"</p><p></p><p>"Did you use your secret technique - the Blood Explosion Technique? To perform a short-distance teleportation?"</p><p></p><p>"That's right!"</p><p></p><p>"Phew~!"</p><p></p><p>Sai Mu'er let out a long sigh.</p><p></p><p>He probably already figured out the origin of the matter.</p><p></p><p>It was very likely that the Tiger God, seeing that they hadn't returned, sent Feng Long to look for them.</p><p></p><p>After all, Feng Long is a semi-divine beast expert.</p><p></p><p>But Ye Xiao has already become a King Realm expert! So he must have been unable to defeat Ye Xiao, so he used the Blood Explosion Technique, but accidentally teleported himself into this Gathering Formation.</p><p></p><p>This idiot, he still doesn't know that he has fallen into Ye Xiao's breeding ground.</p><p></p><p>But at least he's lucky, he didn't go anywhere else, but just happened to come to this good place.</p><p></p><p>So, taking a deep breath, Sai Mu'er smiled and said, "Feng Long, welcome to Ye Xiao's Star Beast Breeding Ground, and become the 12th poultry of this breeding ground. The breeding ground has just been expanded, and there is still a lot of open space inside, you can now freely choose a nest for yourself."</p><p></p><p>Feng Long: "?"</p><p></p><p>"Have you gone crazy? What nonsense are you talking about? Hurry up and come back with me to see the Tiger God."</p><p></p><p>Sai Mu'er shrugged.</p><p></p><p>"You can't leave. As long as you come to this place, you will become that human's poultry, just like us."</p><p></p><p>"You're really insane! I'll catch you and hand you over to the Tiger God for punishment."</p><p></p><p>Sai Mu'er shrugged again.</p><p></p><p>"You don't need to catch me. If you can take me away, I'll go with you anytime. You can try first, see if you can get out of here."</p><p></p><p>Feng Long sneered coldly.</p><p></p><p>"Idiot, this is just a private space, do you think he can stop me? Open it up!"</p><p></p><p>With a loud shout, Feng Long directly unleashed all his spiritual energy, turning himself into a beam of light that shot towards the sky!</p><p></p><p>Duang~!</p><p></p><p>Accompanied by a violent explosion, Feng Long turned into a puddle of mud, falling to the ground, shaking his head and bleeding from his nose and mouth.</p><p></p><p>"What the hell is this place?"</p><p></p><p>"I told you already, once you come here, you can't leave. It's better to face reality and obediently become a poultry with us."</p>

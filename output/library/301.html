        <h1>Chapter 301</h1>
        <div class="content">
            <p>Here is the full English translation of the Chinese excerpt:</p><p></p><p>"Let me take a look first, what good things are inside?" </p><p></p><p>Tun Yue Ao Zang Long laughed as he stepped forward.</p><p></p><p>The other star beasts immediately followed closely behind him.</p><p></p><p>Although it was under everyone's watchful eyes, no one was afraid that he would secretly take it all for himself.</p><p></p><p>But everyone was already so eager to see what good things were inside.</p><p></p><p>Ning Wuheng wanted to move, but was held back by the Fox Empress.</p><p></p><p>He looked at the Fox Empress, and she shook her head.</p><p></p><p>"There's no need for you to go up anymore."</p><p></p><p>As soon as she finished speaking, the Tun Yue Ao Zang Long who was walking in the front suddenly exploded into a mist of blood. </p><p></p><p>The fresh blood splattered onto the faces of the other star beasts, causing them to shudder and stand there, completely at a loss.</p><p></p><p>The next moment, Ye Xiao's figure slowly emerged from the ruins of the Imperial Realm.</p><p></p><p>Seeing this scene, all the star beasts immediately narrowed their eyes.</p><p></p><p>There was actually someone inside the Imperial Realm inheritance!</p><p></p><p>This suddenly emerging person had absolutely no aura, but that was the most terrifying part.</p><p></p><p>Because it meant that his cultivation was so powerful that they could not even sense it.</p><p></p><p>"This, this person, could he be, could he be an Imperial Realm expert?" </p><p></p><p>Yu Wuji panted heavily, his terrified pupils slightly unfocused.</p><p></p><p>Damn it! They had actually encountered the legendary human Imperial Realm expert! A real, living Imperial Realm expert? What kind of joke was this? "How is this possible? The human race only has six Imperial Realm experts in total, and out of those six, only two are from the Nine Provinces. We've all seen them before. But this person is also from the Nine Provinces, yet we've never seen him before?"</p><p></p><p>"No, the Imperial Realm inheritance, the heavenly phenomenon? No! He is a new Imperial Realm expert! I remember now, I remember. The rumor says that when a human cultivator advances to the Imperial Realm, there will be a purple qi coming from the heavens and earth phenomenon?"</p><p></p><p>"Damn it! It was just his breakthrough just now, yet we didn't have any reaction at all, watching him succeed in his breakthrough dumbly."</p><p></p><p>At this moment, these Deity-level star beast experts were filled with regret, wishing they could slap themselves.</p><p></p><p>Why were they so stupid? Why didn't they stop him in time?</p><p></p><p>If they had stopped him in time, maybe they could have made Ye Xiao's breakthrough fail, causing him to suffer backlash and perish.</p><p></p><p>But now? Not only did Ye Xiao not perish, he had become an unparalleled expert, a human Imperial Realm expert!</p><p></p><p>He had completely cut off their path to survival.</p><p></p><p>A deep sense of despair shrouded the hearts of the star beasts, not even leaving them the thought of fleeing.</p><p></p><p>No, to be precise, it wasn't that they didn't want to flee or didn't dare to flee, but that they were simply unable to do so.</p><p></p><p>Even if there was still a last struggle in their hearts, their physical bodies were completely out of their control.</p><p></p><p>Standing before an Imperial Realm expert, they were like a group of tiny ants before a fierce tiger. The overwhelming shock made their muscles spasm and stiffen.</p><p></p><p>Even the spiritual energy within them had completely stagnated, unable to circulate.</p><p></p><p>The terrifying scene was not over yet.</p><p></p><p>When Ye Xiao's true body completely emerged from the ruins, all the star beasts instantly fell to their knees on the ground with a 'boom'.</p><p></p><p>Their hard kneecaps shattered the ground, and they couldn't even lift their heads.</p><p></p><p>Too terrifying!</p><p></p><p>Was this the legendary Imperial Realm expert?</p><p></p><p>In the past, they had at most only caught a glimpse of the human Emperor from afar on the battlefield, although the distance was great, especially in the starry sky where the distance could easily reach hundreds of miles. At that time, they could only sense the terrifying aura of the Imperial Realm through long-range.</p><p></p><p>But today, when they approached the human Imperial Realm expert up close, they suddenly realized the true horror of the human Imperial Realm experts.</p><p></p><p>It was simply too overwhelming, not leaving them the slightest chance to survive.</p><p></p><p>Among them, the Iron-Armored Rhinoceros ranked 114th on the Star Ranking desperately tried to raise his head to take a look at this human, to see what he looked like. With all his strength, he forced his body to lift his head inch by inch.</p><p></p><p>From Ye Xiao's feet, to his knees, to his chest, with every inch his head rose, he felt as if he was bearing the weight of millions of tons. </p><p></p><p>The pressure was oppressing him to the point that he could hardly breathe, his face turning deathly pale.</p><p></p><p>As he raised his head, his bones were constantly trembling.</p><p></p><p>Finally, his head was raised to the point where he could see Ye Xiao's chin.</p><p></p><p>"Just a little more, just one more bit, and I'll be able to see this human's appearance clearly."</p><p></p><p>However, at this moment, 'crack'!</p><p></p><p>Accompanied by a crisp sound, his spine suddenly snapped, and his massive body collapsed to the ground.</p><p></p><p>All the star beasts in the scene, seeing this, were horrified to the point of numbness.</p><p></p><p>Their minds had completely frozen.</p><p></p><p>Except for the initial Tun Yue Ao Zang Long, Ye Xiao didn't even lift a hand afterwards. He simply relied on the aura emanating from his body to effortlessly subdue all the star beasts present.</p><p></p><p>This was already shocking enough, but even the star beast ranked 114th on the Star Ranking...</p><p></p><p>Here is the full English translation of the Chinese excerpt:</p><p></p><p>The mighty Iron Rhino, who ranks 114th on the Star Ranking, was directly suppressed by his aura to the point that its spine was crushed just from trying to look up at him!</p><p></p><p>The Iron Rhino's physique was far superior to the other star beasts present. </p><p></p><p>Yet even with such formidable physical strength, it could not withstand the mere pressure of the other's aura.</p><p></p><p>If the other were to make a move, what a sight that would be! But then again, the Iron Rhino was not even worthy of the other making a move, as it was completely outclassed and unqualified.</p><p></p><p>What a pitiful situation this was.</p><p></p><p>The gap between the Monarch Realm and the Divine Ancestor Realm was already immense, but this was on an entirely different level of disparity.</p><p></p><p>Now that the other had reached the Emperor Realm, the gulf between them and these divine beasts on par with human Monarchs had grown so vast. The power difference between the Emperor Realm and the Monarch Realm was unfathomable! This deep sense of powerlessness was something they had never experienced before.</p><p></p><p>The onlookers like Ning Yuhen and the Fox Empress were left speechless in shock at this sight.</p><p></p><p>They all knew the Emperor Realm was formidable, but no one had imagined it to be to this extent.</p><p></p><p>Especially Ning Yuhen, who already greatly admired Ye Xiao, was now in awe of his master to the utmost degree.</p><p></p><p>This was his master? </p><p></p><p>So overwhelmingly powerful! He was right to have followed this person.</p><p></p><p>His master was truly the eternal deity in his heart!</p><p></p><p>Ye Xiao swept his gaze across the Silver Fox Valley, his mind stirring. In the next moment, the Eternal Life Sutra activated, and all the deceased Silver Fox Clan members were instantly revived.</p><p></p><p>"So powerful!" </p><p></p><p>The Fox Empress' pupils constricted again, her scalp tingling in shock.</p><p></p><p>Ye Xiao's display was simply too beautiful, too formidable.</p><p></p><p>The Silver Fox Clan's Ascension Sutra could also revive the dead, as long as their souls remained. But they could never match the speed at which Ye Xiao had healed and resurrected all the injured and deceased clan members, numbering over a hundred thousand.</p><p></p><p>This power was truly heaven-defying.</p><p></p><p>Mr. Ye, just how powerful have you become? The Fox Empress couldn't help but wonder in her racing heart.</p><p></p><p>Ye Xiao looked at the revived Silver Fox Clan members, feeling a slight sense of helplessness.</p><p></p><p>If only he had the power to revive Senior Wen as well. Then the human race would gain another Emperor Realm expert! Alas, Senior Wen's demise was a natural one, part of the cycle of life and death, a law of nature that Ye Xiao had not yet the power to overcome.</p><p></p><p>At least not yet.</p><p></p><p>Looks like he would have to wait until he was stronger to revive him.</p><p></p><p>After all, Senior Wen was a predecessor of the human race, and had even sacrificed his divine blood to help Ye Xiao's own blood ascend. Such a kindness was not easily forgotten.</p><p></p><p>Shifting his gaze, Ye Xiao then turned his attention to the star beasts before him.</p><p></p><p>A bird, a rhino, a divine flower, a lamb... Roasted, steak, salad, skewered lamb? Well, he could certainly add some new dishes to his repertoire. And these were all divine beast realm experts, on par with human Monarchs, their vital energies even more potent, able to greatly strengthen his own blood energy.</p><p></p><p>Not bad, not bad at all.</p><p></p><p>Without giving them a chance to react, he simply willed them into his spatial ring.</p><p></p><p>Afterward, Ye Xiao retracted his aura.</p><p></p><p>The entire Silver Fox Valley instantly felt a sense of relief. Ye Xiao's aura had been overwhelmingly powerful, suppressing them to the point of difficulty in even breathing, especially the weaker members who had just been revived.</p><p></p><p>"Master!" </p><p></p><p>The moment the aura pressure was lifted, Ning Yuhen was the first to rush forward, his excitement uncontainable. His admiration for his master, who had now become an Emperor Realm expert, was beyond measure.</p><p></p><p>"Master, you are truly incredible! To have actually broken through to the Emperor Realm! In the past hundreds of years, no one in the Nine Provinces has achieved this. You are the first in centuries!"</p><p></p><p>Ye Xiao shook his head with a faint smile.</p><p></p><p>"There are always those stronger than oneself. Though I have reached the Emperor Realm, I have only just begun. There are many in this universe more powerful than I. There's no need for such excessive praise."</p><p></p><p>"I don't care, no matter how strong others are, they are still others. In my heart, you are the mightiest of all."</p><p></p><p>Faced with Ning Yuhen's enthusiastic adulation, Ye Xiao could only smile wryly. </p><p></p><p>Ning Yuhen was different from others, his admiration and loyalty for Ye Xiao was genuine and heartfelt. So let him praise as he wished.</p><p></p><p>As long as Ye Xiao's own mind remained clear-headed, that was enough.</p>

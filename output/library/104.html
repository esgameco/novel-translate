        <h1>Chapter 104</h1>
        <div class="content">
            <p>Here is the full English translation of the Chinese excerpt:</p><p></p><p>The crowd trembled in their hearts, scared out of their wits, and immediately retreated quickly.</p><p></p><p>But although their speed was fast, the speed of the black-scaled snake was even faster, more than twice as fast.</p><p></p><p>The long tail swept across, destroying the trees, and the huge force heavily slammed into the bodies of the three martial artists, directly flattening their chests into rotten mud.</p><p></p><p>In the blink of an eye, it then spat venom towards a few other figures.</p><p></p><p>"Ah—!"</p><p></p><p>A few people let out a miserable scream, and were quickly corroded into ashes.</p><p></p><p>When the black-scaled snake fights, the venom it spits out can directly corrode low-level cultivators into dregs.</p><p></p><p>Normally, it would not easily use its venom, but instead preserve the corpses of its opponents as food.</p><p></p><p>But today, it had become enraged to the extreme.</p><p></p><p>The leader's legs were trembling.</p><p></p><p>It's over! </p><p>It's completely over now.</p><p></p><p>This damned intelligence really got them killed.</p><p></p><p>That little black-scaled snake was indeed of a transcendent level, but the intelligence didn't say that behind it, there was a big black-scaled snake! And this big black-scaled snake's cultivation had already reached the Grandmaster level!</p><p></p><p>How are they supposed to deal with this? "Retreat quickly, save whoever can be saved! We must convey the situation here, so that other humans don't rashly come in."</p><p></p><p>The leader shouted, and the crowd, upon receiving the order, instantly scattered like birds and beasts.</p><p></p><p>Admittedly, abandoning one's companions is certainly wrong from a moral perspective.</p><p></p><p>But this is in accordance with the alliance's regulations.</p><p></p><p>When a mercenary company encounters a powerful star beast, they are allowed to flee.</p><p></p><p>If there are survivors left behind, they can transmit the intelligence out, preventing the entire human race from suffering greater losses.</p><p></p><p>This is also something unavoidable - since humans are too weak, some sacrifices are destined to be made for survival.</p><p></p><p>Although the big black-scaled snake was very fast, faced with the martial artists scattering in all directions, it couldn't immediately pursue and capture each one.</p><p></p><p>This made it even more enraged, and all of this was because of the message sent out by that human leader! "Hiss~!"</p><p></p><p>It violently inhaled spiritual energy, its massive body twisting and pushing off the ground, rushing straight towards the leader.</p><p></p><p>The leader stomped his foot and rapidly retreated.</p><p></p><p>But how could his speed possibly compare to a Grandmaster-level black-scaled snake?</p><p></p><p>He was just a post-Heavenly Ninth-Grade martial artist!</p><p></p><p>The black-scaled snake approached in an instant, its huge body destroying everything in its path, making the ground tremble.</p><p></p><p>Fierce winds blew, and the leader could even smell the foul breath of the black-scaled snake.</p><p></p><p>It's over.</p><p></p><p>At this moment, the leader had even unconsciously slowed his pace.</p><p></p><p>When a human is utterly desperate, their body will no longer put up much resistance.</p><p></p><p>It was as if he had accepted his fate.</p><p></p><p>But just as he was in despair, a figure wrapped in golden light suddenly appeared before him.</p><p></p><p>With a slight raise of the hand, a thousand-zhang sword beam burst forth.</p><p></p><p>Boom—! In an instant, the entire world was filled with white radiance, illuminating everything, and also swallowing the leader's consciousness into the darkness.</p><p></p><p>He didn't know how long it had been, it felt like a century had passed, or perhaps just a moment, when the leader felt a stinging pain on his face.</p><p></p><p>"Captain, wake up, wake up!"</p><p></p><p>He emerged from his daze, looking bewildered at the teammate embracing him.</p><p></p><p>If he remembered correctly, this teammate had just been flattened in the chest by the black-scaled snake.</p><p></p><p>"Are we in hell?"</p><p></p><p>Here is my translation of the Chinese excerpt:</p><p></p><p>"What hell? We're doing just fine."</p><p></p><p>"Just fine?"</p><p></p><p>The captain was startled, and a cool breeze swept over him, making him feel a chill in his crotch, causing him to suddenly sit up.</p><p></p><p>And when he looked around at the entire environment, he was completely dumbfounded.</p><p></p><p>Where was the forest they had just been in? Within a radius of tens of li, all the plants and trees had been completely destroyed, leaving only bare yellow earth.</p><p></p><p>There was a massive sword scar on the ground, extending over a thousand zhang from a point five meters in front of him, reaching several meters deep, splitting the entire area in half.</p><p></p><p>The water pool at the end of the sword scar had also been split open, the water spraying out and wetting the surrounding ground.</p><p></p><p>His clothes and pants were also soaked in the water.</p><p></p><p>The straight sword scar connecting the muddy water pool, along with the large area of wet ground, was indescribable.</p><p></p><p>But what was more overwhelming was the shock! </p><p></p><p>Startling, heart-pounding shock! What kind of power could create such tremendous destructive force?</p><p></p><p>This was the work of an existence akin to a divine miracle!</p><p></p><p>The captain remembered that in his moment of despair, a figure wrapped in golden light had suddenly appeared, and with a mere gesture, the entire world had been shrouded in desolation.</p><p></p><p>It must have been that senior who had saved them, truly a godlike figure able to unleash such a sword scar with a single strike, and even heal them.</p><p></p><p>Their savior's power was likely even greater than the Ancestral Sect.</p><p></p><p>"Captain, who did this?" </p><p></p><p>The captain shook his head.</p><p></p><p>"I don't know who did this, but I can say for certain that it was an exceptionally powerful senior of the human race!"</p><p></p><p>"It's a pity that I was knocked unconscious and couldn't see their face."</p><p></p><p>"Just be grateful you were saved, with your chest all flattened. Such a supreme expert is not someone ordinary people can see. Go gather everyone, we shouldn't linger here, we need to hurry back and report this."</p><p></p><p>"Yes, sir!"</p><p></p><p>Meanwhile, hundreds of li away in the underground of Jianghai City, a roar suddenly echoed out.</p><p></p><p>"Damn the humans, they've actually killed my Black Scale Snake general! Black Scale Snake had cultivated to the Xiantian Third Rank, just one step away from becoming a Grand Master.</p><p></p><p>Killing Black Scale Snake is like severing my right and left arms!</p><p></p><p>It seems the fifty years of peace have made you forget the pain of being ruled by me.</p><p></p><p>The day of the Seven Stars Convergence is not far off.</p><p></p><p>Humans, prepare to receive my divine judgment!</p><p></p><p>The wrath of King Ai will once again blaze through several great cities, even the entire Central Plains!</p><p></p><p>This time, I will bathe the human race in blood, creating a sacred land for the Beasts to thrive!</p><p></p><p>And that human brat from the library, you wait for me, I will dismember you, cook, fry, stir-fry, roast, braise, and pickle you into a feast!"</p><p></p><p>"Aqin!"</p><p></p><p>Back home, Ye Xiao suddenly sneezed violently.</p><p></p><p>He rubbed his nose, unable to help furrowing his brow.</p><p></p><p>"Which bastard is cursing me?"</p>

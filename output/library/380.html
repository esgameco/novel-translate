        <h1>Chapter 380</h1>
        <div class="content">
            <p>Here is the full English translation of the Chinese excerpt:</p><p></p><p>Ye Xiao's punch had plunged the entire world into a deathly silence.</p><p></p><p>Ning Yuhen, the Vixen Queen, and all the members of the Silver Fox Tribe were dumbfounded at the sight.</p><p></p><p>The air was so quiet that one could hear a pin drop.</p><p></p><p>Ye Xiao had killed a Quasi-Divine Realm expert? Had they seen it right?</p><p></p><p>Ye Xiao's cultivation level shouldn't have reached that level yet, right?</p><p></p><p>In other words, in addition to his rapid progress, he could also defeat enemies above his level? And what was this ancient secret art?</p><p></p><p>Judging from the words of the Quasi-Divine Realm expert, it seemed incredibly powerful!</p><p></p><p>How did Ye Xiao obtain it? At this moment, countless questions were echoing in the minds of the onlookers, leaving them perplexed and bewildered.</p><p></p><p>Ye Xiao did not dwell on these thoughts. The Black Soul Tribe members had all been eliminated, and now it was time to start healing the Silver Fox Tribe.</p><p></p><p>With a thought, the iron chains binding Ning XuanYuan and the Vixen Queen snapped open.</p><p></p><p>Afterward, Ye Xiao used the Immortality Art on all the Silver Fox Tribe members, and in the blink of an eye, their wounds had completely healed without a trace.</p><p></p><p>"Master! Are you really my master?" Ning Yuhen excitedly ran over, hesitating a bit before approaching.</p><p></p><p>The master's recent display had been so shocking and dazzling that he still hadn't recovered from the awe.</p><p></p><p>Ye Xiao was somewhat at a loss for words. "Who else could it be? It's not like someone else would come to rescue you."</p><p></p><p>Ning Yuhen rubbed his nose and gave an embarrassed smile. "Haha, the master is right."</p><p></p><p>Ye Xiao then spoke again, "So, what are you planning to do next? You can't stay in this star domain anymore. There are too many divine clans here, and if you remain, it will only lead to your demise."</p><p></p><p>Ning Yuhen's expression turned grave. "Other places aren't that easy to go to either. As more and more divine tombs are being excavated here, the divine clans attracted to this place are increasing as well. Many areas that we used to be unaware of are now occupied by various star beasts or divine clans."</p><p></p><p>Ye Xiao glanced around. "Well, I have a place here, and I don't know if you'd be willing to take your tribe there. You don't need to worry about your personal safety in the short term, and there will be immortal herbs available, but you'll have to work."</p><p></p><p>Ning Yuhen's eyes lit up. "Of course we're willing! Finding a safe place is already not easy, let alone one with immortal herb supplies. As for the work, it's the same as here, except we don't even get paid. At least we'll be able to survive, and have immortal herbs as well."</p><p></p><p>Ye Xiao: "Alright, then it's a deal. I didn't force you into this."</p><p></p><p>Ten minutes later, Ning Yuhen and the entire Fox Tribe, gazing at the massive divine crystal mine and the countless powerful star beasts constantly mining, fell into deep contemplation.</p><p></p><p>The expressions on Ning Yuhen and the entire Silver Fox Tribe were like this: (⊙.⊙)!</p><p></p><p>"Master, where did you get this massive divine crystal mine from?"</p><p></p><p>"You don't need to ask about that. Just tell me if you can do the work or not."</p><p></p><p>"Of course we can! This work is not difficult at all. It's no different from grave-digging, except grave-digging requires more skill, like breaking formations and avoiding traps. This is just mindless digging."</p><p></p><p>"Then have your people start working. I'll pay you by the amount you dig. I don't care about your cultivation levels, the more you dig, the more rewards you'll get. It'll all be the immortal herbs and various heavenly treasures that you star beasts need."</p><p></p><p>"Okay! I'll lead them to start working immediately."</p><p></p><p>Ye Xiao nodded and instructed Illusion Jade Glass a few words before returning to the surface.</p><p></p><p>The addition of the Silver Fox Tribe would definitely accelerate the progress. The effort required to excavate the divine crystals was fixed, and to prevent instability and divine crystal explosions, the rate also had certain requirements. It wasn't about cultivation speed; otherwise, he would have dug it himself long ago, as he could probably have pierced through the Divine Nation's treasury in a single day.</p><p></p><p>Now, with the possibility of the Divine King's Tomb being excavated, information about the Divine Nation's treasury could be leaked at any time, so he had to speed up the progress. The Silver Fox Tribe could be considered a timely rain, arriving just in time.</p><p></p><p>Two days later, news came from the front that the major families of the XuanYuan Clan and the Alliance of a Hundred Tribes had clashed!</p><p></p><p>The reason was that they had discovered a Divine King's Tomb. The battle was said to be extremely brutal, with the major families of the XuanYuan Clan losing over ten Divine Realm experts, and the Alliance of a Hundred Tribes losing even more, around twenty or so Divine Realm experts.</p><p></p><p>It couldn't be helped, as the XuanYuan Clan was larger in scale and had higher cultivation civilizations. Even if they were all Divine Realm experts, the techniques they used were different, resulting in varying degrees of damage.</p><p></p><p>In the starry sky above, the XuanYuan Clan and the Alliance of a Hundred Tribes stood in opposition to each other, the atmosphere tense and severe.</p><p></p><p>At the forefront were the young masters of the major XuanYuan Clan families and the representatives of the Alliance of a Hundred Tribes.</p><p></p><p>Ning Zhiyuan swept a glance at the opposing side and cupped his hands in greeting. "Representatives of the Alliance of a Hundred Tribes..."</p><p></p><p>Here is the full English translation of the Chinese excerpt:</p><p></p><p>My fellow alliance members, even before we have opened the Shen Wang Tomb, so many people have already died in vain. If we continue like this, we won't be able to open the Shen Wang Tomb, and between the two sides, we won't know how many more people will have to die.</p><p></p><p>In the end, even if we manage to obtain this Shen Wang Tomb, for us it will be a loss rather than a gain! It will be meaningless.</p><p></p><p>Instead of resorting to force, why don't we try to resolve this peacefully? Let's work together to open the Shen Wang Tomb and share the resources inside equally. After all, in this starry sky, there are bound to be more than just this one Shen Wang Tomb.</p><p></p><p>What do you all think?"</p><p></p><p>The representatives of the Alliance of a Hundred Tribes exchanged glances and then chuckled lightly.</p><p></p><p>"Since Young Master Ning has spoken thus, what else is there for us to say? We shall follow Young Master Ning's suggestion."</p><p></p><p>Ning Zhiyuan nodded.</p><p></p><p>"Given our previous fierce battle, there is still some discord between the disciples of our respective tribes. I suggest that the main armies of both sides wait in the starry sky, while we each send an equal number of disciples of comparable cultivation to enter the Shen Wang Tomb and explore it. How does that sound?"</p><p></p><p>"Acceptable! This proposal seems reasonable enough."</p><p></p><p>"Good! Then let us begin exploring this Shen Wang Tomb right away. Please, after you."</p><p></p><p>"Young Masters, please lead the way."</p><p></p><p>The group quickly stepped forward, their eyes shining with excitement as they gazed upon the Shen Wang Tomb before them.</p><p></p><p>The Shen Wang Tomb! This was an ancient Shen Wang Tomb!</p><p></p><p>What grandeur must the Shen Wang have possessed? The resources within would be enough to make any existence below the Shen Wang level green with envy, excited, and even driven mad! But at this moment, the first array blocked their path.</p><p></p><p>"Does anyone here excel at formations? Step forward and work together to break through this array."</p><p></p><p>"I will do it. This old man has some proficiency in formations."</p><p></p><p>From the Alliance of a Hundred Tribes, an elder with completely white hair, who had already reached the first realm of the Divine Boundary, stepped forward.</p><p></p><p>From the XuanYuan Clan, a young master with a tall and powerful aura, who had already reached the peak of the Emperor Realm and was just a step away from entering the Divine Boundary, also stepped out.</p><p></p><p>"The XuanYuan Clan will have Ling take care of this."</p><p></p><p>Ning Zhiyuan nodded.</p><p></p><p>"Then I'll leave it to Brother Ling."</p><p></p><p>The young Ling master nodded and walked up alongside the elder, beginning to decipher the array.</p><p></p><p>Their array-breaking abilities were naturally far inferior to Ye Xiao's level.</p><p></p><p>What Ye Xiao could have broken in a few minutes, took them several hours.</p><p></p><p>After several hours, the group finally managed to break through the first array.</p><p></p><p>This was the main gate of the Shen Wang Tomb, the first sealing array.</p><p></p><p>After breaking through this array, a vast and majestic aura immediately swept over them.</p><p></p><p>The group was overjoyed.</p><p></p><p>"Such a dense spiritual energy!"</p><p></p><p>"Haha, this must undoubtedly be the Shen Wang Tomb! No other Shen Tomb could possibly have such a scale of spiritual energy."</p><p></p><p>"Let's go, let's open the next array."</p><p></p><p>The group quickly entered the Shen Wang Tomb, afraid of falling behind.</p><p></p><p>Several hours later, the second array was broken open.</p><p></p><p>Another vast and ancient spiritual energy gushed forth.</p><p></p><p>Although it was tinged with a strong sense of antiquity, the group felt as if they were smelling the freshest of floral scents.</p><p></p><p>Because they knew that this meant they were getting closer and closer to the very heart of the Shen Wang Tomb.</p><p></p><p>After more than ten hours, the third array was broken!</p><p></p><p>Twenty hours later, the fourth array was broken!</p><p></p><p>Finally, after a full day and two nights of arduous struggle, all the arrays had been opened.</p><p></p><p>The group had finally arrived at the very center of this Shen Wang Tomb, feeling the boundless spiritual energy that was sealed within. They could even imagine how powerful and profound the cultivation of this Shen Wang must have been in his lifetime, and how abundant the spiritual energy within his body must have been.</p><p></p><p>"Quick! Go in and see what's inside."</p><p></p><p>At this moment, almost all the powerful cultivators simultaneously sprang into action, rushing into the very center of the tomb.</p><p></p><p>They seemed to have already envisioned piles of treasures and resources.</p><p></p><p>But when they all entered, they couldn't help but be dumbfounded.</p><p></p><p>What was going on?</p><p></p><p>Why was it so empty here? There was nothing, not even a single strand of hair!</p><p></p><p>The group looked around in disbelief, left and right, trying to see if there were any hidden mechanisms or if the treasures had all been hidden away. However, no matter how they searched, they could not find any treasures at all.</p><p></p><p>"This is truly strange. The aura clearly indicates that this is a Shen Wang Tomb without a doubt! How could this happen?"</p><p></p><p>The spiritual energy could not have been a deception, and the arrays were not damaged in the slightest, so it was impossible for someone to have been here before.</p><p></p><p>But where were the treasures?</p><p></p><p>Just then, a commotion suddenly arose from outside.</p><p></p><p>"I dare you to touch it! This divine water was discovered by me first!"</p>

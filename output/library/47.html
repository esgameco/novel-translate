        <h1>Chapter 47</h1>
        <div class="content">
            <p>Here is the full English translation of the Chinese excerpt:</p><p></p><p>"The days are passing by," Yangzhengyi murmured, seeing the water surface starting to form a whirlpool, and shook his head again.</p><p></p><p>"I can't go back! If I don't kill the Aier King to avenge my master and fellow disciples, I'll end up driving myself insane sooner or later. </p><p></p><p>You should leave, this is not a battle you can be involved in. If you stay here, you will die."</p><p></p><p>Yexiao did not speak again.</p><p></p><p>"Without experiencing the suffering of others, do not advise them to do good." This was a principle he had understood a long time ago.</p><p></p><p>Just like in his previous life, many people would often ask: "Your life is almost over, why don't you bravely and happily cherish the remaining days?"</p><p></p><p>If they had to endure the nausea, vomiting, and hair loss from chemotherapy, as well as the constant physical decline, nerve pain, and the fear of approaching death that he experienced, how many of them would be able to bravely and happily cherish each day as they advised?</p><p></p><p>But he absolutely could not agree with Yangzhengyi, because he had killed or indirectly caused the deaths of so many innocent ordinary people, turning them into tigers. What about their families? They were powerless to resist, just like Yangzhengyi was powerless against those he spoke of! But Yangzhengyi also had goodness in his heart - he had participated in the slaying of the Aier King, saving countless civilians, no less. </p><p></p><p>Who would repay his kindness? Who would understand his sacrifices and sorrows in that great battle? </p><p></p><p>When a great hero who saved countless lives becomes a murderer, where does the real fault lie? Or is everyone at fault?</p><p></p><p>Who dares to say that Yangzhengyi has no right to this long-awaited showdown with the Aier King for revenge? Yexiao was not a law enforcer, he had no right to judge Yangzhengyi.</p><p></p><p>"Before I leave, I have one last question. Why did you use Gu Hai to lure me away? With your cultivation, you shouldn't have had to worry about me, right?"</p><p></p><p>Yangzhengyi smiled.</p><p></p><p>"Whether you think I'm self-important or hypocritical, it doesn't matter. </p><p></p><p>When I look at you, I see my younger self - unknown, quietly cultivating alone. </p><p></p><p>But you're stronger than I was. At such a young age, you've already reached the realm of a grand master. </p><p></p><p>Perhaps one day, you could become one of the most powerful figures in humanity!</p><p>I couldn't bear to attack you.</p><p></p><p>I hate those above, I hate the Aier King, but I don't hate you or humanity.</p><p></p><p>I can't let my personal vengeance destroy the rising new star of humanity!</p><p></p><p>I just hope you don't follow in my footsteps. People should be a little more selfish, sacrificing themselves for others will only drive you insane in the end."</p><p></p><p>Yexiao exhaled deeply, having received his answer, then turned and left. In just a few moments, he had disappeared from the riverbank.</p><p></p><p>But just as he left the riverbank, a thousand-meter-long sword beam, like a divine descent, fell heavily onto the riverbank.</p><p></p><p>Boom! Accompanied by a violent explosion, the ground was blasted open into a massive thousand-meter-long gash.</p><p></p><p>Yexiao's voice then came from behind.</p><p></p><p>"Jianghai City is where I live, where I have my closest friends. I don't want anyone to disturb the peace of Jianghai City again. </p><p></p><p>Whether it's you or the Aier King, those who cross this line will be ruthlessly eliminated!"</p><p></p><p>Yangzhengyi was stunned for a moment, then smiled wryly.</p><p></p><p>"This brat has quite a temper. A mere grand master dares to talk to me, the great grand master, like that? Does he think he's a grand master himself?"</p><p></p><p>But after scolding him, Yangzhengyi's expression gradually became serious, because the whirlpool on the river surface was growing larger and larger, already spreading to over a hundred meters in diameter, almost reaching him.</p><p></p><p>Here is the full English translation of the Chinese excerpt:</p><p></p><p>By the Riverbank</p><p></p><p>Boom! Suddenly, a massive bolt of lightning descended from the sky, and countless dark clouds quickly gathered, shrouding the once clear sky, turning it as dark as night.</p><p></p><p>In the Martial Arts Academy, Qin Shenglong, who was sparring with Pao Jiansheng, stopped his movements and looked up at the strange phenomenon in the sky, his face filled with gravity.</p><p></p><p>"What's going on? Why has the sky turned like this? And that sound of a blade just now, what was that about?"</p><p></p><p>Pao Jiansheng also looked up at the sky with a solemn expression.</p><p></p><p>"Celestial anomaly, it seems something is about to emerge."</p><p></p><p>In the library, Ouyang Yunzhong quickly leaped to the rooftop, gazing towards the riverside, and soon the commander of the city defense forces, Nangong Ling, also arrived by her side.</p><p></p><p>"This aura, the cultivator's realm has likely reached the Grand Ancestor level! Who is it?"</p><p></p><p>Ouyang Yunzhong said gravely, "I just found out that the library was raided, and an extremely important document was stolen - the Map of the Aier King!"</p><p></p><p>Hearing the words "Aier King", Nangong Ling couldn't help but shudder.</p><p></p><p>"The Aier King? The legendary beast-deity that invaded our Jianghai City during the Great Beast Calamity in the past?"</p><p></p><p>"That's right! Back then, the experts of our city subdued him, but did not kill him. Instead, they divided and suppressed him in the surrounding cities. Jianghai City also has a part of him, which has been used to improve the spiritual energy of our city.</p><p></p><p>But even if only a part of him is revived, his strength will not be weak. At least, he will not be weaker than a Grand Ancestor!"</p><p></p><p>Nangong Ling swallowed hard.</p><p></p><p>"Then we must quickly arrange for the citizens to evacuate!"</p><p></p><p>Ouyang Yunzhong looked at him.</p><p></p><p>"How can we evacuate? Once the Grand Ancestor emerges, even if you run for an hour, can you really escape him?"</p><p></p><p>"Then are we just going to sit here and wait to die?"</p><p></p><p>"It shouldn't be that bad. I can sense the aura of another human Grand Ancestor there as well! Perhaps it is our city's legendary swordsman, or the great sword master. </p><p></p><p>We can only pray for the heavens to protect us."</p><p></p><p>Soon, an alarm rang out across the entire city.</p><p></p><p>"Attention all citizens of Jianghai City, a severe weather change has been detected. All citizens, please return home immediately and do not linger outdoors."</p><p></p><p>By the riverside, accompanied by a loud crackling sound, a bolt of lightning plunged into the huge vortex.</p><p></p><p>The next moment, a terrifying aura rapidly surged up from within.</p><p></p><p>"Hahaha! After more than a hundred years, I, the King, have finally emerged!"</p><p></p><p>Exclaiming excitedly, a towering figure over two meters tall, with two thick goat-like horns on his head, flew out from the river bottom, standing proudly in the sky.</p><p></p><p>Lightning tore through the sky, striking his muscular body, but the sparks merely bounced off without harming him.</p><p></p><p>He patted the remaining sparks on his chest, his gaze falling on Yang Zhengyi by the riverbank, raising an eyebrow.</p><p></p><p>"Hmm? It's you, little Taoist priest? I didn't expect to encounter an old acquaintance right after emerging, how interesting."</p><p></p><p>Yang Zhengyi drained the wine jar in one gulp, threw it away, and drew the long sword on his back, slowly rising into the air.</p><p></p><p>His eyes gleamed with icy intent.</p><p></p><p>"After more than a hundred years, you've lived long enough. I'll send you to the underworld!"</p><p></p><p>(End of this chapter)</p>

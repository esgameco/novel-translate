        <h1>Chapter 215</h1>
        <div class="content">
            <p>Here is the full English translation of the Chinese excerpt:</p><p></p><p>"Heh!"</p><p></p><p>Ye Xiao cleared his throat, and Samuels' pupils suddenly shrank.</p><p></p><p>"What do you want to do?"</p><p></p><p>Ye Xiao rubbed his throat.</p><p></p><p>"Nothing, I'm just clearing my throat. What are you afraid of? I won't vomit on you. Or do you want me to vomit on you?"</p><p></p><p>Samuels suddenly started trembling.</p><p></p><p>"You dare vomit on me!"</p><p></p><p>"Heh, vomit~."</p><p></p><p>Before Samuels could finish saying "try", Ye Xiao had already vomited on him.</p><p></p><p>"Ahhh! I'm going to kill you!"</p><p></p><p>Samuels charged at Ye Xiao like a madman.</p><p></p><p>Boom! But the next moment, he was violently slammed into the wall by a punch from Ye Xiao.</p><p></p><p>Tears of humiliation slid down his cheeks.</p><p></p><p>How many years had it been?</p><p></p><p>He had followed the Tiger God, slaughtering countless human beings on the starry battlefield, many of whom were human experts. </p><p></p><p>He had slaughtered them like ants and even devoured them, turning them into his own nourishment.</p><p></p><p>In his eyes, humans were a lowly race, merely simple food.</p><p></p><p>Just like little bugs, little ants, he could torment them however he wanted.</p><p></p><p>He usually didn't even bother to look at them.</p><p></p><p>Yet now, he had been beaten and humiliated by a human he despised the most.</p><p></p><p>This intense feeling of shame made him wish he could just die immediately.</p><p></p><p>Ye Xiao showed no mercy at all.</p><p></p><p>"I'll ask you one last time. Are you willing to obediently listen?"</p><p></p><p>"Hehe..." </p><p></p><p>Samuels revealed a mocking smile.</p><p></p><p>"Do you think this will make me fear you? Let me tell you. Since I said it's impossible, it will always be impossible.</p><p></p><p>I am a great general under the Tiger God, I am the noble star beast - the Azure Dragon tribe! I am a Ninth-Grade Primal Sage! I won't let you have me as your poultry!</p><p></p><p>Dreaming of making me your pet, forget it!"</p><p></p><p>Samuels let out a roar, his eyes turning bloodshot as the power within him suddenly began to surge and erupt violently.</p><p></p><p>Nolphius and the other star beasts' faces changed drastically.</p><p></p><p>"Damn it, he wants to self-destruct!"</p><p></p><p>"Fuck! This crazy bastard! Does he want to drag us down with him too?"</p><p></p><p>Soon, under a violent burst of light, Samuels detonated himself.</p><p></p><p>As a Ninth-Grade Primal Sage star beast, his self-destruction was truly apocalyptic in scale!</p><p></p><p>If he were outside, he would have had full confidence in easily destroying the entire Jianghai City.</p><p></p><p>But here, with Ye Xiao's imperial formation and the Vajra Indestructible Divine Skill protecting him, he wouldn't be able to harm Jianghai City.</p><p></p><p>Ye Xiao had full-body armor and the Vajra Indestructible Divine Skill, so he naturally had no need to fear him.</p><p></p><p>However, the other star beasts in this space were not the same.</p><p></p><p>Their strength had not reached the Ninth-Grade Primal Sage level.</p><p></p><p>And they also lacked Ye Xiao's defensive capabilities.</p><p></p><p>So they were completely unable to withstand Samuels' self-destruction.</p><p></p><p>Boom! The explosion consumed Samuels' body, as well as his soul and consciousness.</p><p></p><p>However, even in death, he felt a sense of pride, honor, and heroism.</p><p></p><p>To die for the dignity of the star beasts, he died gloriously, died with honor!</p><p></p><p>Farewell, Great Tiger God!</p><p></p><p>Samuels, I have not let you down.</p><p></p><p>Time passed, second by second, and it was unknown how long it had been.</p><p></p><p>Maybe it was a century, so long.</p><p></p><p>Or maybe, it was just a single second.</p><p></p><p>Samuels felt his consciousness drifting in the darkness, and then he saw a ray of light.</p><p></p><p>He couldn't help but reach out, and the next moment, the light suddenly expanded, enveloping him.</p><p></p><p>Everything in front of him had returned to the previous state.</p><p></p><p>As if nothing had changed at all.</p><p></p><p>Ye Xiao's face still had a faint smile, and they were still in the previous space, and the other star beasts were all unharmed.</p><p></p><p>Samuels: "(⊙.⊙)!"</p><p></p><p>A deep sense of bewilderment was reflected in his heart.</p><p></p><p>What was going on?</p><p></p><p>Was it an illusion?</p><p></p><p>No!</p><p></p><p>It was not an illusion!</p><p></p><p>Because those star beasts were all cursing him, and the injuries on his own body had all disappeared.</p><p></p><p>He was now completely unharmed.</p><p></p><p>Was it Ye Xiao who had restored everything?</p><p></p><p>Nolphius' voice scolded him.</p><p></p><p>"You big idiot! If we could die, we would have died long ago. Do you really think we want to be your poultry here? He has healing arts, and not just one, but several imperial-level healing arts!"</p><p></p><p>Susan angrily added, "And each of those healing arts is at the imperial level. There's no way you could have died."</p><p></p><p>Samuels completely collapsed.</p><p></p><p>At this moment, when he looked at Ye Xiao's handsome face, where was the previous heroic and spirited demeanor?</p><p></p><p>Now, he only had fear and despair constantly spreading within him.</p><p></p><p>Ye Xiao took a few steps back.</p><p></p><p>"It seems you're not willing to listen. Since that's the case, then you can't blame me. Nolphius, you star beasts can all gang up on him, vomit on him, piss on him, whatever. Just make sure you deal with him."</p><p></p><p>Here is the full English translation of the Chinese excerpt:</p><p></p><p>"He said, 'Starting tomorrow, all you star beasts can have a week off.'"</p><p></p><p>"Yay!"</p><p></p><p>"Me, me!"</p><p></p><p>"I've been holding it in for so long, my urine is yellow, let me spray him!"</p><p></p><p>Upon hearing that they could have a week off, the star beasts were simply ecstatic, their excitement reaching a peak.</p><p></p><p>This was such a rare opportunity that no one wanted to miss it. Samwell even saw Moyu, Jifeng, and even Susan start to prepare to lift their skirts.</p><p></p><p>He completely collapsed. If he really let them do that, as a severe late-stage germaphobe, he would be utterly miserable.</p><p></p><p>"Wait!"</p><p></p><p>He immediately flapped his wings, signaling the star beasts not to act rashly.</p><p></p><p>Then, he took a deep breath, strode up to Ye Xiao, stared at him for a few seconds, gritted his steel teeth, and directly knelt down in front of Ye Xiao.</p><p></p><p>"My feathers, sharp as knives, are good materials for forging weapons.</p><p>My flesh and blood are extremely tough and elastic, with a chewy texture.</p><p>If they are contaminated by saliva and urine, they will be unfit for consumption."</p><p></p><p>Ye Xiao nodded and patted Samwell's head.</p><p>"That's right! If you had done this earlier, it would have saved us all a lot of trouble."</p><p></p><p>Samwell shed tears of humiliation.</p><p>He knew that this dark history of his could never be erased.</p><p></p><p>Since it was his first day joining, Ye Xiao did not immediately put him to work, but let him rest first, and he would officially start tomorrow.</p><p></p><p>However, even though he could start a day later, the cultivation technique in his star pearl could not wait.</p><p></p><p>In front of all the star beasts, Ye Xiao smashed his skull and took out the star core inside, which was a body technique.</p><p></p><p>Unfortunately, this body technique was of the same type as the Divine Will Technique, which was why Ye Xiao could catch up to Samwell using the Divine Will Technique.</p><p></p><p>Helpless, Ye Xiao could only heal him and then leave, returning to the surface.</p><p></p><p>After Ye Xiao left, Samwell looked at the others, his face somewhat flushed.</p><p>He could not bear this humiliation, but he could not die either. It was truly agonizing.</p><p></p><p>"Everyone... I'm... I'm sorry for disgracing the star beast clan."</p><p></p><p>Norpheus patted his back and comforted him, "It's okay, everyone has gone through a situation like yours. No one will laugh at you."</p><p></p><p>"Thank you."</p><p></p><p>Samwell's tone was a bit choked, and then he spoke again:</p><p></p><p>"Senior, I want to know. Do we have a way to escape this place? Escape his clutches?"</p><p></p><p>"I've thought about it before. If we could be discovered by star beasts during a calamity, they might be able to rescue us.</p><p>Of course, if no star beasts can find us, then the time will be much longer."</p><p></p><p>"How long?"</p><p></p><p>Samwell asked urgently, and Norpheus spoke with a grave expression:</p><p></p><p>"Before, I thought we could probably escape in about four thousand years.</p><p>Now that you've joined, I feel this time needs to be increased by half, about six thousand years.</p><p>In six thousand years, even if we don't reach the King Realm, we might be able to outlive him."</p><p></p><p>"Six thousand years, is it really that long?"</p><p></p><p>Samwell was instantly filled with despair.</p><p></p><p>Although star beasts have very long lifespans and can live for thousands of years as long as they don't die in battle, the thought of having to survive in this dark and narrow space for thousands of years was agonizing to him.</p><p></p><p>Seeing the despair on his face, Norpheus sighed deeply, but also felt a bit relieved.</p><p>Fortunately, he was only a branch body here.</p><p>His main body was currently at the Shaolin Monastery.</p><p>As long as the main body didn't come, he would basically be fine.</p><p>Maybe in the future, if the branch body really couldn't escape, the main body could escape on its own. At least he wouldn't be extinguished.</p><p></p><p>Meanwhile, after returning to the surface, Ye Xiao received a call from Fa Zheng before he even got home.</p><p></p><p>"Hello! What's the matter so late at night?"</p><p></p><p>Quickly, Fa Zheng's anxious voice came from the other end of the line.</p><p></p><p>"Little Ye Shishi, I need to return to Shaolin for an urgent matter, but my Shaolin branch is still under construction.</p><p>I'm giving you my storage ring. Please help me distribute the supplies according to the workers' requirements.</p><p>I've given the ring to Dean Ouyang, and she will pass it on to you tomorrow.</p><p>Of course, if you're busy, you can also pass it on to Principal Qin Shenglong of the Martial Arts Academy. He was previously in charge of the coordination between the Shaolin branch and the Martial Arts Academy."</p><p></p><p>Ye Xiao raised his eyebrows slightly.</p><p></p><p>"What's the matter? Why the rush to go back to Shaolin in the middle of the night? Can't it wait until daytime?"</p><p></p><p>"There's no time. The details are not easy to explain. Apparently, Sword Saint Li Liushui has made a mistake in his breakthrough and has fallen into demonic cultivation.</p><p>Now Shaolin has urgently summoned high-level cultivators from all its branches across the nine states to help him stabilize his soul through formation chanting.</p><p>This matter is of great importance. Little Ye Shishi, please do not disclose this to anyone before it is confirmed.</p><p>Okay, I have to catch a flight now. We'll talk more later."</p><p></p><p>With that, Fa Zheng hung up the phone.</p><p></p><p>As for Ye Xiao, he was somewhat shocked.</p><p></p><p>Li Liushui, a mistake in his breakthrough, fallen into demonic cultivation?</p>

        <h1>Chapter 142</h1>
        <div class="content">
            <p>Here is the full English translation of the Chinese excerpt:</p><p></p><p>In the blink of an eye, Fa Neng activated his spiritual energy, and the locked door automatically opened.</p><p></p><p>Fa Neng then strode directly into the courtyard.</p><p></p><p>Huan Liuli and Ye Xiao, the master and cat in the courtyard, were both startled.</p><p></p><p>The two stared fixatedly at Fa Neng, not understanding why he had appeared here. "Bald head? A person from the Shaolin Martial Arts Academy? How did he come here?"</p><p></p><p>Ye Xiao's sudden words made Fa Neng feel a bit bewildered. This kid had gone to the big hotel and picked him up?</p><p></p><p>Looking closely, it did seem to be the same person. He was a low-ranking employee at the library, so Fa Neng hadn't paid much attention to him at the time.</p><p></p><p>He never expected this person to be living here.</p><p></p><p>"No, your gaze and aura are wrong, filled with killing intent. You are not him.</p><p></p><p>This aura...?"</p><p></p><p>Fa Neng was even more shocked. This kid could actually sense the change in his aura, showing he had some brains. It wouldn't be bad to recruit him as a henchman to do many things for him.</p><p></p><p>However, just as he was about to speak, he heard Ye Xiao speak again.</p><p></p><p>"Noel Fiss?"</p><p></p><p>Fa Neng was so shocked that his jaw almost dropped. This kid had actually guessed his true identity?</p><p></p><p>He was really too impressive.</p><p></p><p>But before he could say anything, the next moment, a terrifying sword beam burst forth from Ye Xiao's hand, moving as fast as lightning, directly towards Fa Neng's eyes, getting closer and closer.</p><p></p><p>Fa Neng died.</p><p></p><p>He passed away peacefully.</p><p></p><p>From the moment he opened Ye Xiao's door to when he stepped inside, he didn't even have a chance to say a single word before hearing Ye Xiao's three sentences, and then he was terminated.</p><p></p><p>Until the moment of his death, he still didn't understand what had happened.</p><p></p><p>How could Ye Xiao, a mere library clerk, be so powerful?</p><p></p><p>Ye Xiao was also very puzzled, squatting on the ground and looking at the Fa Neng he had just killed, his gaze full of confusion.</p><p></p><p>"This guy was just possessed by Noel Fiss, but how did he find me here? Could it be that Noel Fiss discovered my clues and sent someone to look for me?"</p><p></p><p>After a while, Ye Xiao shook his head.</p><p></p><p>"Forget it, no matter what, his appearance here will surely arouse the suspicion of others.</p><p></p><p>Huan Liuli, quickly throw his body far away."</p><p></p><p>"Understood."</p><p></p><p>Huan Liuli immediately began to act, dragging Fa Neng's body and quickly leaving the place.</p><p></p><p>Ye Xiao watched Huan Liuli leave, smacking his lips.</p><p></p><p>"It's a pity, it's not Noel Fiss's main body that came, if it was, I could have made octopus meatballs."</p><p></p><p>Fa Neng was just a henchman whose spirit had been altered by Noel Fiss, and was essentially still human, so he couldn't be eaten.</p><p></p><p>After Fa Neng's death, the part of Noel Fiss that was sealed in the basement of the museum couldn't help but let out a furious roar.</p><p></p><p>"Damn it! Who was it? Who killed one of the Lord's fragments? If the Lord encounters you, he will surely skin you, tear out your tendons, dismember you, and grind you into a meat paste to make dumplings! Ah, ah, ah!</p><p></p><p>The Lord is so angry!"</p><p></p><p>But after a while, he let out a sinister voice.</p><p></p><p>"Damn humans, don't think you've won. Fa Neng has already injured Guangliang, and the formation Guangliang set up has a slight flaw.</p><p></p><p>This slight flaw is enough for the Lord to escape.</p><p></p><p>Wait and see, the day the formation breaks open will not be too far away.</p><p></p><p>Then, the Lord will devour all the people in Jianghai City.</p><p></p><p>The day of destruction will descend upon the heads of the entire Jianghai City human race!"</p><p></p><p>Above, Guangliang, who had already constructed the formation and placed the Sword Immortal statue on top of the formation, finally managed to catch his breath.</p><p></p><p>Although Fa Neng's power was far inferior to his, Guangliang had been fully focused on constructing the star formation at the time, and never thought to defend against Fa Neng, so he was indeed seriously injured by the sneak attack.</p><p></p><p>Fortunately, the formation was still completed.</p><p></p><p>In this way, Noel Fiss would no longer be able to escape.</p><p></p><p>As long as the truly dangerous Noel Fiss could not escape, the problem would not be too big.</p><p></p><p>However, after taking a few breaths, he still spoke seriously:</p><p></p><p>"Now that the formation is complete, you can go and hunt down Fa Neng. Fa Neng has become a henchman, his strength is very strong, already a Xiantian Fourth Grade Grand Master. If he goes berserk, he will cause a devastating disaster to the people of Jianghai City.</p><p></p><p>And even if he doesn't go berserk, if he wants to rescue Noel Fiss in the future, he will also be a huge hidden danger."</p><p></p><p>"Yes!"</p><p></p><p>The crowd responded, about to go out and hunt down Fa Neng, but at this moment, Du Changfeng and the others quickly came back.</p><p></p><p>Seeing Du Changfeng and the others return, Guangliang couldn't help but ask in puzzlement:</p><p></p><p>"Dean Du, why have you come back?"</p><p></p><p>The people behind Du Changfeng brought back Fa Neng's body.</p><p></p><p>"Fa Neng is dead."</p><p></p><p>"What!"</p><p></p><p>The Shaolin people were all slightly surprised.</p><p></p><p>They all knew Fa Neng's strength, a Xiantian Fourth Grade.</p><p></p><p>And Du Changfeng also said...</p><p></p><p>Here is the full English translation of the Chinese excerpt:</p><p></p><p>"The Patriarch is only at the Fourth Rank, while the others are Grandmasters. How could they pose such a great threat to Fa Zheng?" The Dean was truly a mysterious figure, and with a single strike, he had caused Fa Neng to be slain. Guang Liang couldn't help but exclaim in admiration, but Dou Changfeng shook his head.</p><p></p><p>"It wasn't me who killed him. It should have been Senior Sword Immortal. There was a sword mark on his brow, and he was killed with a single strike. In the entire Jianghai City, only Senior Sword Immortal would have the ability to instantly slay a Great Grandmaster like this."</p><p></p><p>Guang Liang couldn't help but take a sharp intake of breath as he looked at the sword mark on Fa Neng's brow. The clean-cut wound was very small, but it had not only shattered Fa Neng's Baihui acupoint, but also cleaved through his soul. Fa Neng's face still bore the confusion and shock of his death.</p><p></p><p>This showed that the strike had been a frontal assault, not a sneak attack. What was more terrifying was that it had been a one-hit kill, without Fa Neng even having a chance to react. Senior Sword Immortal's attainments in the martial arts were truly beyond the reach of ordinary people!</p><p></p><p>Guang Liang looked towards the statue of Senior Sword Immortal and clasped his hands in a reverent salute. "Amitabha!"</p><p></p><p>The incident soon blew over. Guang Liang had sustained heavy injuries and needed to return to the Shaolin Martial Arts Academy to receive treatment. Jianghai City had not suffered any major attacks and the matter did not cause a significant stir.</p><p></p><p>Two days later, the library expansion was officially completed. Fa Zheng, who had remained, was responsible for the handover of the martial arts manuals.</p><p></p><p>Ye Xiao could finally start work. When he arrived at the library, he couldn't help but be curious about the new statue at the entrance.</p><p></p><p>"Huh? Why is there a statue at the entrance of the library? Whose statue is this?"</p><p></p><p>A colleague passing by explained with a faint smile, "Haven't you been online? This is the Sword Immortal!"</p><p></p><p>"The Sword Immortal?"</p><p></p><p>"Yes, the peerless expert of our Jianghai City. There's an inscription in front of it."</p><p></p><p>Ye Xiao quickly walked up to the front and when he fully confirmed that this ugly, earthy old man statue was indeed him, he was completely flustered. Couldn't the people of Jianghai City imagine him as a handsome, valiant young man? Why did they have to make him look so old? After all, the Divine Ancestor could maintain his youthful appearance.</p><p></p><p>After a while, Ye Xiao could only resign himself to accepting it. At least this proved that his identity was well-hidden.</p><p></p><p>He could only console himself with this rather A-Qish mentality.</p><p></p><p>Next, it was time to officially start work.</p><p></p><p>The library had recruited a new batch of employees, all of whom had a cultivation base of at least the Fourth Rank of the Posterior Heavenly Realm, with the weakest being at the Third Rank. This had raised the overall strength of the Martial Arts Library.</p><p></p><p>However, in Ye Xiao's eyes, they were nothing more than cannon fodder. Against true powerhouses, they were insignificant. They could only serve to prevent some martial artists with malicious intentions.</p><p></p><p>Since these new employees lacked experience in library work, they could not be placed in management positions. And with two-thirds of the original employees being dismissed, Ye Xiao was promoted again, from the third-floor area manager to the fourth-floor area manager. His monthly salary had now increased to 15,000, which was quite substantial.</p><p></p><p>But for Ye Xiao, this was not important. What mattered was something else.</p><p></p><p>The fourth floor and above contained martial arts manuals of at least the Transcendent Realm, and even some at the Grandmaster level. It was said that the manuals donated by Shaolin were also at this level or even higher.</p><p></p><p>To Ye Xiao, this was like a child falling into a candy factory. With so many books, and ones that were even more optimized than ordinary manuals, he would soon be able to find a solid foundation to cultivate the Emperor Technique.</p><p></p><p>On the third day of Ye Xiao's work, Fa Zheng brought the martial arts manuals donated by Shaolin to complete the handover. There were a total of 60,000 books, compiled by the martial artists of the Shaolin Martial Arts Academy throughout history.</p><p></p><p>Unlike the popular books on the market, most of Shaolin's martial arts manuals were refined from the star cores of slain star beasts.</p><p></p><p>The handover was divided into three levels: the fourth, fifth, and sixth floors. The fourth floor had the weakest manuals, while the sixth floor had the strongest.</p><p></p><p>After the handover was completed, it was lunchtime. Originally, Director Ouyang had planned to host a banquet to entertain Fa Zheng, but Fa Zheng insisted that there was no need for extravagance, and he just wanted to have a simple meal with Ye Xiao in the cafeteria.</p><p></p><p>As usual, a bowl of white rice and a cup of clear tea. Fa Zheng, the ascetic monk, always ate the same simple fare.</p><p></p><p>During the meal, Ye Xiao couldn't help but ask, "Fa Zheng, are all the martial arts manuals donated by your Shaolin Martial Arts Library at the Transcendent Realm and Grandmaster level?"</p>

        <h1>Chapter 140</h1>
        <div class="content">
            <p>Here is the full English translation of the Chinese excerpt:</p><p></p><p>"If you don't bring this up, we can still be good friends."</p><p></p><p>"Haha haha..."</p><p></p><p>The elderly Dharma Upright monk burst into laughter. He was easygoing in temperament, and although he was much older, he could still play freely with Ye Xiao.</p><p></p><p>The other few top martial arts experts from the Shaolin Martial Arts Academy also noticed the two, especially that one Quasi-Divine Ancestor.</p><p></p><p>He glanced at Ye Xiao, his gaze revealing a hint of surprise.</p><p></p><p>Strange, this kid, why does he give me a somewhat inexplicable and unfathomable feeling?</p><p></p><p>At first glance, it seems like there's something. </p><p></p><p>But looking again, it's just an ordinary person.</p><p></p><p>However, upon further reflection, there shouldn't be any problem.</p><p></p><p>I have cultivated for over a hundred years and have already reached the level of a Quasi-Divine Ancestor, a cultivation realm that very few in the world can attain even after a lifetime of effort.</p><p></p><p>He's just a child, what could be so special about him?</p><p></p><p>There's no way he could be a Divine Ancestor expert, that would be too ridiculous.</p><p></p><p>Those fastest to reach the Divine Ancestor realm in this world, how could they be inferior to this child? Shaking his head, he stepped forward.</p><p></p><p>"Dharma Upright, is this the excellent young man you mentioned?"</p><p></p><p>Dharma Upright nodded and introduced with a smile, "Senior Brother Guangliang, this is the Ye Xiao I told you about earlier. This child has an excellent character and is very suitable to join our Dharma Gate. Aside from being a bit of a glutton, he has no other greed."</p><p></p><p>Guangliang nodded.</p><p></p><p>"Nowadays, the Buddhist path no longer prohibits the desire for food and drink, so that cannot be considered a flaw. The most important thing in our Buddhist way is the concept of affinity. Since you, Dharma Upright, think so highly of him, it seems you two have a karmic connection. Would you consider joining our Shaolin?"</p><p></p><p>Ye Xiao: "(_..)! "</p><p></p><p>Do all these Buddhist monks so persistently try to recruit people? He shook his head.</p><p></p><p>"Thank you, Venerable, but I have no such plans."</p><p></p><p>Guangliang nodded.</p><p></p><p>"I won't force you. But if one day you change your mind, our Buddhist gate will always be open to welcome you."</p><p></p><p>"Thank you."</p><p></p><p>Ouyang Yunzhong came over and looked at Ye Xiao with some regret, then spoke:</p><p></p><p>"Venerable Guangliang, I have prepared the banquet, please come in."</p><p></p><p>Guangliang nodded, and the group quickly entered the hotel.</p><p></p><p>Ye Xiao didn't want to get too entangled with the crowd, so he walked in last.</p><p></p><p>However, at this moment, he suddenly felt a strange sensation from behind.</p><p></p><p>He looked back, and a faint, barely perceptible murderous aura was emanating in the air.</p><p></p><p>The sealed murderous aura had begun to spread.</p><p></p><p>But it still lacked the power to break through the seal. Ye Xiao scanned it and estimated its cultivation to be around the Quasi-Divine Ancestor realm at the seventh grade of the Innate Realm.</p><p></p><p>This cultivation level might not seem very strong at first glance, but Ye Xiao could sense that this aura was not complete.</p><p></p><p>Just like Aer King, after being divided, his clone's cultivation was only at the Grand Master realm, but the true power of the original must be much stronger.</p><p></p><p>Looks like another formidable character. </p><p></p><p>Indeed, this world is still too dangerous. I must work harder to improve myself.</p><p></p><p>Decided, from now on, I'll read an extra hour of books every day. No, two hours!</p><p></p><p>Afterwards, Ye Xiao followed the group and entered the hotel.</p><p></p><p>Only two Grand Master experts remained outside the bus, guarding the vehicles.</p><p></p><p>When everything was quiet, a faint and evil will began to seep out from the sealed iron box.</p><p></p><p>"Foolish humans, actually cutting off a part of me and taking it out of Shaolin.</p><p></p><p>Wanting me to serve as a formation anchor to absorb spiritual energy for this city?</p><p></p><p>How laughable.</p><p></p><p>Does this small city even deserve for me, the Sovereign, to be its formation anchor? Even if there are Divine Ancestor experts, what do I have to fear?</p><p></p><p>But well, this is a good opportunity for me to break out of the human's seal.</p><p></p><p>Feel the pain, you lowly human race."</p><p></p><p>The next moment, this will suddenly surged into the body of one of the Grand Master monk experts.</p><p></p><p>That Grand Master shuddered slightly, and his facial features began to distort.</p><p></p><p>But soon, he regained his normal appearance, except for the sinister smile at the corner of his mouth and the ominous, bloodthirsty aura in his eyes, indicating that he was no longer a Shaolin expert.</p><p></p><p>He glanced at the other Shaolin Grand Master out of the corner of his eye, and a burst of energy began to coalesce in his palm.</p><p></p><p>But to his surprise, the other's perception was very keen. </p><p></p><p>The moment he was about to strike, the other had already sensed it and turned his gaze towards him.</p><p></p><p>"Farang, are you alright? Why is your spiritual energy a bit out of control?"</p><p></p><p>Farang's expression changed slightly, and he immediately withdrew the spiritual energy in his palm.</p><p></p><p>"Nothing, perhaps I'm about to break through, and the spiritual energy in my body is a bit difficult to control."</p><p></p><p>The other Grand Master revealed an envious look.</p><p></p><p>"You really are remarkable. It took me a long time to break through to the fifth grade of the Innate Realm. I didn't expect you to be about to break through again so soon after just entering the fourth grade."</p><p></p><p>"Senior Brother is too kind. It's all thanks to the guidance of our teachers. By the way, why don't you go eat first? I'll stay here and watch over things."</p><p></p><p>Here is the full English translation of the Chinese excerpt:</p><p></p><p>"No need, eating is just a formality. At my level as a Grand Master, even if I don't eat for half a year, it doesn't matter.</p><p></p><p>If you want to eat, you can go inside, I'll stay out here and keep watch."</p><p></p><p>"Alright then, I'll go check the surroundings, in case there are any star beasts or beastmen trying to cause trouble."</p><p></p><p>"That's a good idea, be careful."</p><p></p><p>"Understood."</p><p></p><p>Fa Neng responded and quickly disappeared from the spot.</p><p></p><p>"This guy's cultivation is quite high, I, the invading Grand Master, only have the strength of a Xiantian Fourth Grade, a bit inferior to him. </p><p></p><p>Moreover, I've just started invading the soul, not yet having full control. If he's disturbed by external forces, it'll be easy for him to suppress my spiritual power.</p><p></p><p>Then my plan would fail.</p><p></p><p>I'd better quickly devour and take full control of Fa Neng's soul.</p><p></p><p>That way, when they try to seal me and cast me into the underground of the Jianghai City, I can seize the opportunity to strike back, and surely create an unexpected effect."</p><p></p><p>On the other side, after dinner, the group from the Library and Shaolin, that Quasi-Divine Realm expert Guangliang, went into a separate room with the Librarian Ouyang to discuss some important matters. </p><p></p><p>The other Library colleagues were responsible for receiving the other Shaolin experts. </p><p></p><p>Ye Xiao naturally was in charge of the old acquaintance Fa Zheng.</p><p></p><p>The two leaned by the window, gazing at the scenery outside the hotel.</p><p></p><p>Fa Zheng smiled faintly and said, "Patron Ye, you must not have been happy with the meal today."</p><p></p><p>Ye Xiao just smiled, but was inwardly speechless.</p><p></p><p>In fact, when he heard that Quasi-Divine Realm expert Guangliang say at the hotel entrance that the Buddhist sect no longer forbids indulgence in sensual pleasures, he had already vaguely guessed what was going on.</p><p></p><p>But he didn't expect them to be so ruthless.</p><p></p><p>Nowadays, the monks not only eat meat, but also abalone, giant prawns, and Buddha Jumps Over the Wall.</p><p></p><p>What happened to the pure precepts and disciplines?</p><p></p><p>But thinking about it, in the past when Buddhism was not yet developed, those rules were too cumbersome.</p><p></p><p>You say that maintaining a pure heart and mind and not eating meat is fine, but many people just can't endure it, their bodies need protein after all.</p><p></p><p>Not everyone can be like Fa Zheng, practicing asceticism.</p><p></p><p>Now it's fine to eat meat, I heard they even allow marriage and finding a partner, so many people want to become monks.</p><p></p><p>If it weren't for the rule in the Nine Realms that to become a monk requires a high academic degree and passing an exam, the disciples of Shaolin would probably make up half of the martial artists in the world!</p><p></p><p>The benefits are good, the treatment is high, and they can basically do everything ordinary people can do, it's hard for them not to develop well.</p><p></p><p>Ye Xiao looked at the car convoy below and spoke lightly:</p><p></p><p>"By the way, is Shaolin here this time to deliver some books?"</p><p></p><p>Fa Zheng nodded.</p><p></p><p>"Yes, we've delivered some books, all of which are excellent cultivation techniques transcribed by our Shaolin.</p><p></p><p>In addition, this old monk will also serve at the Jianghai City Martial Arts Academy for a period of time. The Jianghai City Martial Arts Academy will set up a special department for our Shaolin branch, which will be responsible for teaching martial arts."</p><p></p><p>Shaolin teaching martial arts is very normal, and Ye Xiao was not surprised, because teaching martial arts does not mean becoming a Shaolin disciple.</p><p></p><p>To become a Shaolin disciple, one still needs the recommendation of a Shaolin high monk, or to pass the unified examination of the Nine Realms.</p><p></p><p>Teaching martial arts is a tradition of Shaolin, and it is also a way to indirectly find some talented disciples.</p><p></p><p>If there are disciples with relatively good aptitude, they will recommend them, and they will have the qualifications to join Shaolin.</p><p></p><p>Regarding this point, the Nine Realms have not made any mandatory requirements.</p><p></p><p>After all, Shaolin teaching martial arts to the vast majority of people is beneficial to the entire Nine Realms. Accepting a small portion as disciples is also acceptable.</p><p></p><p>As long as there is no coercion, it is a mutually beneficial arrangement.</p><p></p><p>The development of Shaolin has also obtained the support of the Nine Realms because of this contribution.</p><p></p><p>"That's good, contributing to the inheritance of martial arts in the Human Realm, educating the younger generation, is also a good thing."</p><p></p><p>"That said, the reason why this poor monk stays here is not just because of this matter. There is another matter, which is that our Shaolin needs to suppress the avatar of an extremely powerful star beast in Jianghai City, and set up a Gathering Spirit Formation to enhance the spiritual energy of Jianghai City."</p><p></p><p>"This kind of confidential matter, telling me, isn't that a bit inappropriate?"</p><p></p><p>"There's nothing wrong with that, there are too many such things in the Nine Realms, as long as you don't go out and publicize it widely.</p><p></p><p>Moreover, I believe that with your temperament, you won't be that much of a busybody."</p><p></p><p>Ye Xiao smiled, and Fa Zheng spoke again:</p><p></p><p>"The star beast we are sealing this time is very powerful, it is the avatar of a peak Divine Realm star beast. Although it is just an avatar, its cultivation is at the Divine Realm level, with Xiantian Seventh Grade strength.</p><p></p><p>So it still cannot be underestimated.</p><p></p><p>Our Shaolin, in addition to the Formation expert Guangliang Shishu, also dispatched eighteen Grand Masters including myself to jointly set up the formation."</p><p></p><p>"They really attach great importance to it! This star beast is so powerful, what is it exactly?"</p><p></p><p>This is the end of the first update, 3000 words.</p><p></p><p>Each chapter is 3000 words, and I will continue to work hard to update daily.</p><p></p><p>Please recommend votes, monthly votes, and tips, I'm very grateful.</p><p></p><p>Everyone, please interact more, leave more comments and discussions, I will definitely work harder to update.</p><p></p><p>Thank you all!</p><p></p><p>(End of this chapter)</p>

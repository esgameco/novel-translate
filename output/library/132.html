        <h1>Chapter 132</h1>
        <div class="content">
            <p>Here is the full English translation of the Chinese excerpt:</p><p></p><p>How can we fight against this? </p><p></p><p>How can we battle? Is this the enemy they have to face?</p><p></p><p>They are completely on a different level!</p><p></p><p>The chests of the crowd seemed to be choked, and they couldn't say a word.</p><p></p><p>At this moment, the Aier King glanced at them.</p><p></p><p>Just with that one glance, in an instant, the crowd felt as if they had been sentenced to death, bound to the execution scaffold!</p><p></p><p>That kind of overwhelming pressure and pain was completely indescribable. </p><p></p><p>It's over, they are definitely going to die.</p><p></p><p>The Aier King had been suppressed for a full fifty-six years. As a Saint Monarch-level expert, to be imprisoned by a group of ants for over fifty years, the fury in his heart must be unimaginable. However, to everyone's surprise, the Aier King did not slaughter them.</p><p></p><p>He merely glanced at them, then turned and left.</p><p></p><p>He left! He left!</p><p></p><p>He completely ignored them, as if they were a group of ants not worth his effort.</p><p></p><p>"What should we do now?"</p><p></p><p>Dou Tianyugudu swallowed hard and couldn't help but speak up. </p><p></p><p>Although he was the city lord, these martial arts experts were the ones truly in control.</p><p></p><p>The few Grand Masters looked at each other and said, "We must follow him. We can't defeat him, but we are the strongest cultivators in this city. Even if we die, we should die in front of the others."</p><p></p><p>"Yes! Let's see what he wants to do. Before the Saint Monarch from the Central Plains arrives, we need to stabilize him and try not to make him angry.</p><p></p><p>As long as we can prevent him from killing too many people before the Saint Monarch arrives, that would be the best outcome for us."</p><p></p><p>"We'll split up. The Grand Masters will follow him, while the Masters and below will quickly go out and notify everyone along the way not to provoke him. No matter what he wants to do, they should comply. Even if he kills them, they cannot say a word.</p><p></p><p>Otherwise, once he gets angry, the 7-8 million people in the Jianghai City will be in grave danger."</p><p></p><p>"Understood!"</p><p></p><p>The crowd acted according to the plan, and soon a very bizarre scene unfolded in the entire Jianghai City.</p><p></p><p>A burly Saint Monarch-level beast spirit was walking on the deserted streets, followed by a few human Grand Masters.</p><p></p><p>Neither side made any moves, they were just walking on the road, as if they were filming a movie - extremely unbelievable.</p><p></p><p>"Where is he going?"</p><p></p><p>"I don't know."</p><p></p><p>"Don't talk, the Saint Monarch's hearing is very keen. If you say the wrong thing, people will die."</p><p></p><p>The crowd quickly fell silent.</p><p></p><p>Before long, the Aier King finally stopped moving forward.</p><p></p><p>Everyone was dumbfounded.</p><p></p><p>He actually came to the library! What is this guy doing in the library? Has he gone crazy after being sealed for so long?</p><p></p><p>Just as they were puzzled, the Aier King's voice suddenly came over.</p><p></p><p>"Hey, you little bastards over there, come over to this king."</p><p></p><p>The crowd shuddered, here it comes! He's calling them now! They looked at each other, and everyone's faces turned a little pale.</p><p></p><p>"Let's go, it's a blessing in disguise."</p><p></p><p>Dou Changfeng let out a long sigh and was the first to walk over. </p><p></p><p>The other Grand Masters gritted their teeth and followed.</p><p></p><p>When they reached the Aier King, they expected him to do something to them, but to their surprise, the Aier King just spoke indifferently:</p><p></p><p>"You have one minute to bring out all the books about food in this library, or I'll twist your heads off."</p><p></p><p>Hearing these words, everyone was stunned.</p><p></p><p>Books about food? What does he want the books about food for? Before they could ponder for more than two seconds, suddenly one of the Grand Masters exploded into a mist of blood.</p><p></p><p>Boom! The warm fresh blood splattered on the faces of the others, instantly waking them up. Without saying a word, they rushed into the library and started looking for books.</p><p></p><p>Damn it, how could their brains be so stupid just now?</p><p></p><p>He is the Aier King, a beast spirit that kills people, and a Saint Monarch-level one at that. Whatever he wants, they just have to do it, why think so much? Not that they can be fully blamed. </p><p></p><p>The Aier King's actions are simply too unfathomable.</p><p></p><p>He is a beast spirit who can casually kill without blinking, yet he didn't kill anyone first, and then he went to the library and asked them for books about food. This is truly too bizarre, which made their brains unable to catch up for a moment.</p><p></p><p>Soon, the crowd gathered a pile of books and carefully placed them in front of the Aier King, then respectfully stepped aside, afraid that the Aier King might suddenly attack.</p><p></p><p>As for the cautious and obsequious behavior of the few people, the Aier King merely disdained them with a glance.</p><p></p><p>A bunch of idiots, he is a Saint Monarch-level beast spirit! He can kill whoever he wants, he doesn't care whether these humans will listen to him or not. </p><p></p><p>Whether he kills them or not is entirely up to his whim, he can kill them if he wants to, and not kill them if he doesn't want to.</p><p></p><p>They are being so respectful and hypocritical, does that mean he won't kill people anymore? Ridiculous!</p><p></p><p>However, at the moment, he really doesn't have the desire to kill anyone.</p><p></p><p>That Grand Master he just killed with a thought...</p><p></p><p>Here is my translation of the Chinese excerpt:</p><p></p><p>These guys are too weak, so weak that they don't even have the desire to lift a hand. </p><p></p><p>His only interest now is that stinky kid from the library.</p><p></p><p>He just scanned the area with his spiritual power, and the other is not currently in the library, including his own soul fragment, the young fox demon he previously possessed, is also no longer there.</p><p></p><p>But no matter, if you can run from the monk, you can't run from the temple.</p><p></p><p>Aier Wang knows he will definitely come back, so he only needs to wait here.</p><p></p><p>And during this free time, he's going to take a look at some human cookbooks.</p><p></p><p>Because later, he's going to dismember that human brat into a sumptuous and delicious feast.</p><p></p><p>Salt and pepper is not bad, roast it first then add salt, it will be crispy and fragrant, the fat on the surface will all be roasted golden, and the texture will be very crispy.</p><p></p><p>Stewing is not to his taste, he likes stronger flavors.</p><p></p><p>Hmm, raw intestines? </p><p></p><p>Good stuff! Eating it raw, absolutely raw, haha, he loves that flavor! Spicy liver is also a good dish, but not as appealing.</p><p></p><p>Hmm, insect wine? This is good, good stuff, good stuff, good stuff.</p><p></p><p>He must pluck the little bugs out alive when the brat is fully conscious, let him feel unparalleled pain.</p><p></p><p>Humans are truly geniuses, not only do they have great minds when it comes to learning, but also in inventing and creating dishes, their minds are equally expansive.</p><p></p><p>At this moment, even Aier Wang can't help but praise humans.</p><p></p><p>And when he opens a book on Yingzhou cuisine, his large copper bell-like eyes are wide open in amazement.</p><p></p><p>Wow! These Yingzhou humans are too cruel, if he didn't know they were human, he would even suspect they are as dirty as the worst demonic beasts, having no brain at all, only base instincts.</p><p></p><p>Sashimi!</p><p></p><p>While the fish is still alive, slice the fresh meat off its body piece by piece, then dip it in soy sauce to eat.</p><p></p><p>Wow, this is so stimulating, so much to his liking.</p><p></p><p>He must eat it this way, this is called sashimi, and his own creation should be called "human sashimi"!</p><p></p><p>Hahaha!</p><p></p><p>And just then, he seems to sense something, suddenly raising his head to look towards the square in front of him, the corners of his mouth slightly curving upwards.</p><p></p><p>"I've been waiting for you for a long time, human sashimi!"</p><p></p><p>The other grand masters all have a dumbfounded look on their faces.</p><p></p><p>Following his gaze, they don't see anything. But before they can inwardly mock him, in the next instant, a golden light suddenly appears in the square, exactly where Aier Wang's gaze is focused.</p><p></p><p>The crowd is overjoyed.</p><p></p><p>It's the senior! It's the senior from Jianghai City! He's finally here! Now they will be saved.</p><p></p><p>A sense of relief and happiness fills their hearts.</p><p></p><p>Several of them quickly fly down to Ye Xiao's side, bowing and paying their respects to him, as Ye Xiao is enveloped in the golden light, they can't clearly see his features, and Ye Xiao doesn't need to hide anything.</p><p></p><p>"Senior, you've finally come, we've been waiting so anxiously for you!"</p><p></p><p>"Senior, Aier Wang killed one of our companions, please, senior, uphold justice for our human kin."</p><p></p><p>In the golden light, Ye Xiao is somewhat surprised.</p><p></p><p>He didn't expect Aier Wang to come out so quickly, and even more unexpected is that after coming out, Aier Wang didn't kill many people, only one grand master.</p><p></p><p>This is not like him at all.</p><p></p><p>However, the moment he and Aier Wang made eye contact, he understood Aier Wang's intention.</p><p></p><p>This sheep is waiting for him.</p><p></p><p>His current target is only himself, he has no interest in the others.</p><p></p><p>Quite interesting.</p><p></p><p>Ye Xiao raised his hand slightly, activating the Chenxing Technique, the golden light spreading from his palm, falling on the site of the death.</p><p></p><p>The blood mist still lingering in the air and the fresh blood spilled on the ground quickly coalesced, and in an instant, the grand master was fully restored.</p><p></p><p>The revived grand master stands there dazedly.</p><p></p><p>"Wasn't I just killed? Is this the underworld?"</p><p></p><p>This miraculous technique instantly causes all present to involuntarily suck in a cold breath, their body hair standing on end, as if they were struck by lightning.</p><p></p><p>Heavens, the senior is so powerful! Powerful enough to make one want to cry.</p><p></p><p>Instantaneously restoring the grand master who was blasted into a mist of blood.</p><p></p><p>This skill is simply unparalleled! Even the top-tier healers of the human race could not easily accomplish this.</p><p></p><p>And among them, the most experienced and knowledgeable, Changfeng, is so excited that he's trembling.</p><p></p><p>"It's the Imperial Art! The legendary Imperial Art! Only the top-tier clans possess, the ultimate technique that can make one surpass the divine!"</p>

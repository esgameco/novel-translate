        <div class="content">
            <p>Here is the full English translation of the Chinese excerpt:</p><p></p><p>"The Jianghai City?" </p><p></p><p>This was the first time Li Liushui heard of this small place.</p><p></p><p>"That's right, you didn't use the internet before, so you didn't know. Recently, a super powerful expert has emerged from Jianghai City. He cultivates both the sword and the saber, and his saber techniques, I can feel, are on par with yours, perhaps even able to help you improve significantly."</p><p></p><p>Li Liushui nodded thoughtfully, then bowed to the Shaolin monks.</p><p></p><p>"These days, I have brought much inconvenience to the Shaolin monks. I am deeply apologetic. It is also thanks to the help of the great masters that I was able to suppress the rampage of the power within me.</p><p></p><p>Whenever Shaolin is in need, you can send someone to find me, and I will not refuse."</p><p></p><p>The monks returned the gesture.</p><p></p><p>"Amitabha, the Saber God Li has spoken too humbly. You are a powerful expert in the Nine Realms, you have made great contributions many times, slaying star beasts and saving the common people from peril, our assistance is only natural, no need for gratitude."</p><p></p><p>"Since the great masters have said so, I feel a bit uneasy about it. Unfortunately, my demonic heart is not yet settled. Once I resolve this, I will come to Shaolin to express my thanks."</p><p></p><p>"Amitabha, Saber God Li, I, Dharma Master Zheng from the Shaolin Wudao Academy, also need to go to Jianghai City. Saber God Li can accompany him, so you won't have to use spiritual energy and trigger the demonic nature that has just been suppressed."</p><p></p><p>Li Liushui nodded.</p><p></p><p>"In that case, I'll trouble Dharma Master Zheng."</p><p></p><p>On the other side, Ye Xiao arrived at the Central Plains Martial Arts Library, heading straight to the top floor.</p><p></p><p>Previously, he had used Professor Huang's library card to read books, but Professor Huang's card did not have enough privileges to access the upper levels.</p><p></p><p>However, after North Tong Ce learned of his identity, he gave Ye Xiao special privileges, allowing him to come directly to the top floor to find him.</p><p></p><p>"Mr. Ye, what brings you here today?"</p><p></p><p>North Tong Ce stood up and greeted Ye Xiao when he saw him.</p><p></p><p>"I'm leaving tomorrow, so I came to say goodbye to you today."</p><p></p><p>"Has Mr. Ye completed his cultivation? Time flies, a month has already passed.</p><p></p><p>It's a pity that this old man has to be responsible for guarding the Central Plains, otherwise I could have accompanied Mr. Ye back to Jianghai City to further exchange insights on the eye techniques."</p><p></p><p>"Time is long, we will have the chance to meet again in the future."</p><p></p><p>After a pause, Ye Xiao spoke again:</p><p></p><p>"I came here this time to do something."</p><p></p><p>"Please go ahead, Mr. Ye."</p><p></p><p>"I want to see some imperial arts! This is the Central Plains Martial Arts Library, which is one of the largest martial arts libraries in the Nine Realms. There should be imperial arts here, right?"</p><p></p><p>North Tong Ce nodded.</p><p></p><p>"Indeed, there are imperial arts. However, considering the imperial arts you already possess, you probably won't find much value in the ones here.</p><p></p><p>The imperial arts stored here are generally not the best ones. The truly exceptional imperial arts, with centuries of heritage, are often passed down within a single lineage, and some have even been lost."</p><p></p><p>However, this did not bother Ye Xiao too much.</p><p></p><p>He didn't really care about how good the imperial arts were, as long as they were better than the ones he currently had.</p><p></p><p>The reason he wanted those imperial arts was purely for the purpose of synthesizing higher-level cultivation techniques.</p><p></p><p>"No problem. Just bring them to me. I'll take a look, maybe they can be of use to me."</p><p></p><p>"Alright, since you insist, let me get them for you."</p><p></p><p>With that, North Tong Ce stood up and walked to one of the bookshelves, pressing a few buttons on the side. Suddenly, the bookshelf opened from the middle, revealing a small safe inside.</p><p></p><p>North Tong Ce used a series of extremely complex passwords to open the small safe, and from it, he took out two small notebooks.</p><p></p><p>"Here, these are the two imperial arts preserved in the Central Plains Martial Arts Library."</p><p></p><p>Ye Xiao: "(_..)!"</p><p></p><p>He looked at the two small notebooks, falling into deep silence.</p><p></p><p>In this vast library, there were only these two imperial arts?</p><p></p><p>Was this some kind of joke? He had just seen the other party open the bookshelf and the safe, thinking there would be many imperial arts inside.</p><p></p><p>But to his surprise, there were only two.</p><p></p><p>After all, this was not just some small library, it was many times larger than the Jianghai City Library. Its foundation and resources should be far beyond the Jianghai City Library. How could there only be these two imperial arts?</p><p></p><p>North Tong Ce seemed to have noticed his thoughts and explained with a wry smile:</p><p></p><p>"This is also unavoidable, imperial arts are really too rare. How many true Immortal Cultivators are there in the world?</p><p></p><p>And among these Immortal Cultivators, some have never even seen an imperial art.</p><p></p><p>Aside from the hereditary ones, the only other source is the rewards given by the country.</p><p></p><p>Even the Nine Realms Library doesn't have too many imperial arts collected.</p><p></p><p>However, if you really want to find imperial arts, there is still one method."</p><p></p><p>"What method?"</p><p></p><p>"Extract them from the cultivation techniques of Grandmasters."</p><p></p><p>Ye Xiao was stunned, extract them from Grandmaster cultivation techniques? Could it be the same as his Golden Book Spirit, extracting the most basic techniques from the cultivation methods and then fusing them together?</p><p></p><p>Here is the full English translation of the Chinese excerpt:</p><p></p><p>Combining into One?</p><p></p><p>Beitang Ce continued to explain:</p><p></p><p>"In fact, all cultivation methods are evolved from the Imperial Art. Because the aptitudes of the human race vary greatly, many people can learn the Imperial Art just like that. But for the vast majority of people, seeing the Imperial Art is like looking at a celestial book, completely unable to comprehend it.</p><p></p><p>So, our ancestors used a method of differentiation, dividing the Imperial Art into different Grandmaster-level cultivation methods, and then these Grandmaster-level methods were further differentiated.</p><p></p><p>This is how our current cultivation system was established.</p><p></p><p>From ordinary cultivation methods, to extraordinary cultivation methods, then to Grandmaster-level cultivation methods, and finally the Imperial Art."</p><p></p><p>Hearing this, Ye Xiao finally understood.</p><p></p><p>Strictly speaking, the order of cultivation methods is not from bottom to top, but actually from top to down.</p><p></p><p>So, by using many Grandmaster-level cultivation methods, one can actually achieve the fusion and derivation to form an Imperial Art.</p><p></p><p>Previously, because of the divine spirit of the Golden Book, he was able to extract the most basic techniques from any book and synthesize an Imperial Art, making things too easy, so he didn't think too much about this problem.</p><p></p><p>But if that's the case, shouldn't the Golden Book be able to synthesize other Imperial Arts from different cultivation methods?</p><p></p><p>Why can't it continue to synthesize the same type of Imperial Art using other cultivation methods after synthesizing one? Ye Xiao immediately focused his mind on the divine spirit of the Golden Book, and after careful comparison, he discovered the mystery.</p><p></p><p>The pages that have already synthesized the Imperial Art are generally thicker than the pages that record ordinary cultivation methods.</p><p></p><p>The total pages of the Golden Book are limited.</p><p></p><p>This means that the synthesized cultivation methods are limited, not infinite.</p><p></p><p>And after several or even dozens of cultivation methods are synthesized into an Imperial Art, the pages recording the fundamental base cultivation methods will also be merged together.</p><p></p><p>For example, to synthesize a sword art, a total of nine basic sword methods are required. After the synthesis, in addition to having one page to record the synthesized Imperial Art cultivation method, two thicker pages will also be generated to imprint the Imperial Art cultivation method.</p><p></p><p>These thicker pages may contain the most fundamental techniques, so they can record the same Imperial Art.</p><p></p><p>For example, the pages for synthesizing sword art can only record Imperial-level sword arts, and the pages for synthesizing blade art, because they contain the fundamental blade techniques, can only imprint Imperial-level blade arts afterwards.</p><p></p><p>Ye Xiao just didn't notice this before.</p><p></p><p>No wonder, after the cultivation method is synthesized into an Imperial Art, it won't continue to be refined and imprinted just by looking at the basic cultivation methods, because the pages are fixed, and the Golden Book won't keep synthesizing those "junk" cultivation methods.</p><p></p><p>This also solved a long-standing major confusion of Ye Xiao's.</p><p></p><p>That is, even though the origins of many cultivation methods are the same, why do they still need different cultivation methods for synthesis above the Imperial Art level?</p><p></p><p>Like sword arts, he has already extracted the most fundamental sword techniques.</p><p></p><p>Whether it's the Sword that Slays the Heavens, the Myriad Swords Returning to the Source, or the Imperial Sword Art, they are all sword arts.</p><p></p><p>They cannot escape the most basic sword techniques such as thrusting, chopping, hacking, and sweeping, yet the Golden Book still categorizes them as different sword arts to record.</p><p></p><p>This indicates that Imperial-level cultivation methods, although they have transcended the realm of ordinary cultivation methods, may be different in certain aspects.</p><p></p><p>Perhaps it's the way of practicing?</p><p></p><p>For example, the Sword that Slays the Heavens has only one sword, while the Myriad Swords Returning to the Source has a myriad of swords, and the Imperial Sword Art has a hundred and eight swords?</p><p></p><p>Or perhaps it's the profundity of the cultivation method?</p><p></p><p>This is something Ye Xiao can't quite figure out, but Imperial-level cultivation methods must have something different.</p><p></p><p>Ye Xiao now understands two things.</p><p></p><p>First, after the Golden Book synthesizes an Imperial Art, the pages that have recorded the basic cultivation methods will also be synthesized, but they will be synthesized into blank pages, still carrying the basic attributes of that type of cultivation method, waiting to be imprinted with other Imperial Arts of the same type. But after the basic techniques are synthesized once, they won't be synthesized again in the future.</p><p></p><p>Second, even the cultivation methods that have not been recorded by the Golden Book do not mean they are useless.</p><p></p><p>They may indeed have the same basic techniques, such as blade art being one of the seven basic blade techniques, but they can still be used to synthesize other Imperial-level blade arts, but this requires self-analysis and extraction, and cannot be done through the cheating of the Golden Book's divine spirit.</p><p></p><p>However, this is also a good thing, at least he can continue to search the library for Grandmaster-level cultivation methods and use them for synthesis.</p><p></p><p>"Mr. Ye? Mr. Ye?"</p><p></p><p>Beitang Ce saw that Ye Xiao was lost in thought and couldn't help but call out to him a few times.</p><p></p><p>Ye Xiao snapped out of it.</p><p></p><p>"Mr. Ye, are you alright?"</p><p></p><p>"I'm fine, just find it a bit troublesome, that's all."</p><p></p><p>Beitang Ce chuckled.</p><p></p><p>"Who says it's not? Dividing the Imperial Art into Grandmaster-level cultivation methods is easy, but synthesizing Grandmaster-level cultivation methods into the Imperial Art is difficult."</p>

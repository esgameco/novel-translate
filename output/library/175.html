        <h1>Chapter 175</h1>
        <div class="content">
            <p>Here is the full English translation of the Chinese excerpt:</p><p></p><p>After that, taking advantage of the noon hour, Ye Xiao came to the underground.</p><p></p><p>The seven divine-level star beasts sealed within the seal, seeing his arrival, were immediately frightened and shuddered.</p><p></p><p>Fuck, this plague has come again.</p><p></p><p>Ye Xiao waved his hand, indicating that they need not be overly nervous.</p><p></p><p>"Everyone doesn't need to be nervous, I've come this time to discuss something with you all."</p><p></p><p>The star beasts looked at him with a puzzled expression, and Ye Xiao continued to speak: "I've made some breeding and collection plans here, which are set according to your respective characteristics, so as to minimize your suffering. At the same time, it can also provide me with more value. It can be considered a win-win plan."</p><p></p><p>The star beasts looked at Ye Xiao with disdain. You're unilaterally extracting from us, and yet you still say it's a win-win, how dare you say the words "win-win"?</p><p></p><p>Ye Xiao didn't care about their thoughts. Every one of the star beasts here had blood of the human race on their hands, and Ye Xiao would have no mercy or sympathy for them.</p><p></p><p>"Starting today, Ji Feng and Xuan Shui, you must submit one fresh chicken egg and one fresh turtle egg every day."</p><p></p><p>These two star beasts had the ability to lay eggs, and the eggs they laid were extremely delicious, and could also provide a huge amount of spiritual energy, more than eating their flesh and blood.</p><p></p><p>Because their eggs must be condensed with blood qi and spiritual energy during cultivation.</p><p></p><p>Ye Xiao couldn't possibly eat chicken and turtle meat every day, but if it was two eggs, he could have two fried eggs while eating the meat of other star beasts. Not only could he obtain the same blood qi and spiritual energy, but he could also improve the taste and not make it too monotonous.</p><p></p><p>For example, in addition to fried eggs, there are also boiled eggs, tea leaf eggs, marinated eggs, egg cakes, tomato egg soup...</p><p></p><p>"What, two eggs a day? Impossible!"</p><p></p><p>Ji Feng and Xuan Shui immediately refused. Although laying eggs and having their wings and legs chopped off by Ye Xiao consumed about the same amount of blood qi, at least they could still retain a shred of dignity, because they were forced to have them chopped off by Ye Xiao.</p><p></p><p>But laying eggs, that was active, just like human poultry, for divine-level star beasts, how humiliating would that be? Could they be the same?</p><p></p><p>Ye Xiao swept a cold gaze at the two star beasts, and the two star beasts immediately shuddered, daring to be angry but not daring to speak.</p><p></p><p>Ye Xiao then spoke again:</p><p></p><p>"Deer, you must provide deer antlers and deer blood every day, which I will use to make wine.</p><p></p><p>Noel Fis, you must provide at least one tentacle every day.</p><p></p><p>Xuan Tu Ao, you must provide one ginseng root every day, which I will use to make tea.</p><p></p><p>Xuan Tu Python, Fish, you few must provide a certain amount of flesh and blood every day, and if possible, I hope Fish can provide some fish roe, which I will use to make caviar.</p><p></p><p>I've said my piece, who agrees? Who opposes?"</p><p></p><p>"I object!" </p><p></p><p>The deer directly objected, it had to cut off its antlers and provide deer blood every day, sacrificing the most.</p><p></p><p>But as soon as it said this, it was punched by Ye Xiao into the wall and knocked unconscious.</p><p></p><p>The other star beasts couldn't help but tremble violently.</p><p></p><p>This guy is too cruel.</p><p></p><p>At this moment, the other star beasts turned their gaze to Noel Fis.</p><p></p><p>The meaning of their gaze was very clear, you are the leader now, you speak.</p><p></p><p>Noel Fis had no choice but to clear his throat lightly and said, "This, Mr. Ye, your request is really hard for us. Originally it was just to let us provide one star beast's flesh and blood a day, and now it's suddenly every star beast, which is essentially a unilateral price increase."</p><p></p><p>"Hard? If it's hard, then don't do it."</p><p></p><p>The eyes of the beasts suddenly lit up.</p><p></p><p>"Really?"</p><p></p><p>"Of course not."</p><p></p><p>Ye Xiao's words immediately extinguished the hope of the beasts.</p><p></p><p>He snorted and said, "Don't you all keep picking and choosing here? Don't forget, it was you who came from the starry sky to the ground, I didn't ask you to come.</p><p></p><p>Each of you star beasts has no shortage of human blood on your hands, so don't pretend to be pitiful here now.</p><p></p><p>Either do as I say, or I'll come visit you every hour.</p><p></p><p>And in the future, I won't come often, it will be my pet, Illusion Jade, who will come to collect your things every day."</p><p></p><p>Ye Xiao left Illusion Jade behind and had her start collecting today's production results, while he himself returned to the library to read books.</p><p></p><p>Illusion Jade jumped out and waved to the beasts.</p><p></p><p>"Hello everyone, I'm Illusion Jade the illusion cat, thanks to the master's elevation, I have the honor to serve you all. Please don't give me a hard time."</p><p></p><p>The beasts looked at her with disdain.</p><p></p><p>Even calling herself "I" (咋家), this dog traitor, the shame of the star beast clan.</p><p></p><p>Illusion Jade had already guessed this situation, and she wasn't angry, she just smiled slightly.</p><p></p><p>"The first one to hand in their homework today, I'll speak well of them in front of the master, and they can rest for half a month without having to engage in production."</p><p></p><p>Ji Feng sneered coldly.</p><p></p><p>"Foolish cat, acting as a running dog, betraying your own kind, and still daring to flaunt your might here. Do you think we will submit to your tyranny? Let me tell you, you are delusional, we will protest most severely..."</p><p></p><p>Before she could finish speaking, a few "poof" sounds suddenly rang out beside her ear.</p><p></p><p>Then...</p><p></p><p>Here is my translation of the Chinese excerpt:</p><p></p><p>Seeing Nolphius, the Black Python, and the Fish all cut off a piece of flesh from their own bodies, the Deer also began to cut off its own thigh, and at the same time started to cut off its antlers.</p><p></p><p>Ji Feng: "ヽ(.ˇдˇ;)!"</p><p></p><p>"What are you all doing? Why are you doing as he says? Where is the dignity of the Divine Ancestor Beasts? Where is the dignity?"</p><p></p><p>The Immortal Elder Daoist painfully pulled out one of his own whiskers and said in a mournful tone:</p><p></p><p>"We have all become prisoners, what dignity is there left? Let's just focus on staying alive first. If that Ye fellow were to come down here himself, that would truly be a fate worse than death."</p><p></p><p>"Traitors! You are all traitors!"</p><p></p><p>Ji Feng looked at the motionless Turtle next to her, and felt much more at ease in her heart.</p><p></p><p>"It seems there is still one with backbone among us, Turtle. In the past, everyone said you were a cowardly turtle, but now it seems you have more sense of responsibility than them!"</p><p></p><p>As soon as she finished speaking, the Turtle shook its butt and laid an egg with a "pop", then happily handed it over to Illusion Jade.</p><p></p><p>Ji Feng: "(﹏)!"</p><p></p><p>"Turtle! You too are despicable, it seems I'm the only one left to uphold the dignity of the Divine Ancestor Beast clan!"</p><p></p><p>Several of the Divine Ancestor Beasts handed their offerings to Illusion Jade.</p><p></p><p>"Master Illusion, this is our offering."</p><p></p><p>Illusion Jade nodded.</p><p></p><p>"Not bad, not bad, you are all very cooperative, especially the Deer, you did the best, both offering deer blood and cutting off your antlers, being the first to hand it in, your master will definitely speak well of you in front of the Lord."</p><p></p><p>"Thank you, Master Illusion."</p><p></p><p>"Don't call me Master Illusion, from now on call me Grandpa Illusion!"</p><p></p><p>"Ah yes! Grandpa Illusion."</p><p></p><p>Illusion Jade was overjoyed in her heart. When she watched that human TV drama before, she saw everyone calling that factory owner "Grandpa", and thought it was so cool, so she always wanted someone to call her "Grandpa".</p><p></p><p>Now her dream had finally come true!</p><p></p><p>It seems being with the Lord is truly so blissful, she decided, she will loyally serve the Lord as a slave for at least 1,500 years without any rebellion.</p><p></p><p>Afterwards, her gaze fell on the distant Ji Feng.</p><p></p><p>"This chicken is not cooperating with the Lord's demands, I estimate the Lord will be very unhappy. When the Lord is angry, everyone will suffer, so how about we just get rid of her? No need to hand her over, right?"</p><p></p><p>All the Divine Ancestor Beasts immediately nodded in agreement.</p><p></p><p>"Understood, understood."</p><p></p><p>"Then you all are responsible. By this time tomorrow, I hope to see two chicken eggs."</p><p></p><p>"Understood."</p><p></p><p>"Then I won't disturb you all any further, goodbye."</p><p></p><p>After Illusion Jade left, the gazes of several Divine Ancestor Beasts immediately focused on Ji Feng.</p><p></p><p>Ji Feng: "（⊙＿⊙；）...!"</p><p></p><p>"What are you all trying to do? Don't do anything reckless."</p><p></p><p>The next moment, heart-wrenching screams could be heard from within the seal.</p><p></p><p>Illusion Jade returned upstairs and handed all the items to Ye Xiao.</p><p></p><p>"Master, this is today's harvest. That Ji Feng was disobedient, so I had the other Divine Ancestor Beasts deal with her."</p><p></p><p>Ye Xiao nodded and pushed a piece of Black Python meat towards Illusion Jade, while storing the rest in his storage ring.</p><p></p><p>"A reward for you."</p><p></p><p>"Thank you, Master."</p><p></p><p>Illusion Jade swallowed the snake meat in one gulp, feeling blissful as she lay down to bask in the sun. She felt her inner blood qi starting to rise again, and at this rate, it shouldn't be long before she could advance to the Innate Sixth Grade.</p><p></p><p>How wonderful.</p><p></p><p>Ye Xiao continued reading his book. He now had many cultivation techniques, and no longer needed to focus on cultivating a single technique just to survive. He could read whichever book he wanted, and whichever technique fused first would depend on luck.</p><p></p><p>Currently, he had mastered the Leg Technique, Claw Technique, and Finger Technique. Once he fully grasped these three techniques, his cultivation should be close to breaking through to the King Realm.</p><p></p><p>His short-term goal was to focus on these three techniques.</p><p></p><p>"Duang~!"</p><p></p><p>The end-of-work bell rang, and Ye Xiao prepared to head home, while Liu Chengxun brought over a completed map.</p><p></p><p>"Hello, Manager Ye, the map has been analyzed."</p><p></p><p>"It's really been analyzed? That fast?"</p><p></p><p>Ye Xiao was somewhat surprised. He had only tried it out on a whim, but didn't expect Liu Chengxun to actually analyze the map so quickly. It seems Liu Chengxun has quite the talent for cartography.</p><p></p><p>"Not entirely. I posted a help request online, and as soon as they heard it was me, Liu Chengxun, they enthusiastically helped me analyze the map."</p><p></p><p>Ye Xiao: "(_..)!"</p><p></p><p>This Liu Chengxun really summoned reinforcements like a monkey, didn't he? As the mighty Sword Saint of Hanzhou, even if this map was fake, others would still think it contained some hidden treasure.</p>

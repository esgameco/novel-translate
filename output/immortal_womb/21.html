        <div class="content">
            <p>The Qin Dynasty's eldest prince's residence also received urgent reports from the border and news of Concubine Shu's promotion.</p><p></p><p>Fusu carefully read the two pieces of information.</p><p></p><p>The scholars, upon hearing of Concubine Shu's promotion, felt a deep sense of crisis.</p><p></p><p>Feeling uneasy, they couldn't help but start discussing.</p><p></p><p>"What's going on with this Concubine Shu? Her promotion is too fast!"</p><p></p><p>"Yes, no one in the harem has been promoted so quickly!"</p><p></p><p>"Could it be that she is some kind of peerless beauty? Enchanting the Emperor?"</p><p></p><p>"There are so many beauties in the harem, how could the Emperor be enchanted by just one Concubine Shu?"</p><p></p><p>The scholars chattered and discussed as if this was an earth-shattering event.</p><p></p><p>Hearing the discussion, Fusu felt a bit uncomfortable.</p><p></p><p>These scholars always spoke of the sages' teachings and claimed to be gentlemen.</p><p></p><p>Since they were gentlemen, how could they keep discussing the Emperor's harem affairs?</p><p></p><p>The way they were discussing it, where was the slightest hint of a gentleman's demeanor?</p><p></p><p>It was truly unseemly! It really tarnished the name of a gentleman!</p><p></p><p>Thinking of this, Fusu couldn't help but frown and say, "Everyone, there are urgent reports from the border, and war may break out again."</p><p></p><p>"You all are not concerned about the country's major affairs, but only focus on the trivial matters of the harem, what is the reason for this?"</p><p></p><p>With this righteous and stern appearance, it looked quite-</p><p></p><p>The scholars glanced at each other, each seeing helplessness in their companions' eyes. </p><p></p><p>They inwardly smiled bitterly.</p><p></p><p>The harem was a microcosm of the court, and favored concubines could sometimes influence the Emperor's decisions.</p><p></p><p>If Concubine Shu maintained this level of favor, and gave birth to a son, that child would also gain the Emperor's favor.</p><p></p><p>So their concern for the harem, in the end, was it not for the sake of Fusu's future crown prince position?</p><p></p><p>Not only was he not grateful, he looked at them with disapproval and disdain.</p><p></p><p>Fusu should think, did he really believe they were idle and bored, and that's why they kept an eye on a woman's movements?</p><p></p><p>But they couldn't say this.</p><p></p><p>Because they knew even if they said it, it would be useless.</p><p></p><p>Fusu wouldn't listen.</p><p></p><p>In that pedantic mind of his, he believed as long as his conduct was upright, he would definitely become the crown prince.</p><p></p><p>He didn't consider that unborn child as his competitor at all.</p><p></p><p>Fusu's current appearance, if blame had to be assigned, could only be blamed on them for cultivating Fusu into this pedantic state.</p><p></p><p>The scholars had grievances they couldn't express, and had no choice but to put on an ashamed appearance to express their apologies.</p><p></p><p>Seeing the scholars recognize their mistakes, only then did Fusu nod in satisfaction.</p><p></p><p>He asked the scholars, "Everyone, in the face of the Northern Barbarians' movements this time, how should we respond?"</p><p></p><p>In dealing with the Northern Barbarians, if Fusu-</p><p></p><p>Here is the full English translation of the excerpt from the Chinese novel:</p><p></p><p>If Su performed well, he might even gain the appreciation of the First Emperor.</p><p></p><p>By then, this group of people following Fusu could also get an official position or two.</p><p></p><p>In the future struggle for the position of crown prince, it would also be a powerful bargaining chip.</p><p></p><p>Thinking of this, the Confucian scholars all offered up strategies.</p><p></p><p>On the other side, the same news reached the residence of the Eighteen Princes of Qin.</p><p></p><p>When Huhai learned that Concubine Shu had been promoted to the Eighth Son, his anger immediately surged from his heart. </p><p></p><p>He kicked out at the subordinate reporting the news!</p><p></p><p>The subordinate was caught off guard by his master's action and was immediately kicked over, rolling out.</p><p></p><p>Huhai's anger in his heart vented a little, and he said angrily, "What kind of thing is that Concubine Shu, how can she be worthy of being the Eighth Son? If she gets promoted two more times, won't she be on equal footing with my mother concubine?!"</p><p></p><p>Speaking of this, Huhai's anger kept surging upward.</p><p></p><p>It was already enough that Fusu was born earlier than him, but why should this latecomer Concubine Shu now be catching up to his mother concubine's position? </p><p></p><p>Seeing Huhai's reaction, Zhao Gao was also restless in his heart.</p><p></p><p>He had not expected that the last promotion of Concubine Shu was not an accident, but instead had a tendency to become the norm!</p><p></p><p>This was definitely not a good sign for him!</p><p></p><p>He must find out the secret of Concubine Shu as soon as possible! Find out who the people behind her really are!</p><p></p><p>Thinking of this, although Zhao Gao's face was gloomy, he still spoke out to appease Huhai.</p><p></p><p>"Your Highness need not worry, Luowang has already reached an agreement with the people of Liusha, and Moyu Qilin of Liusha will arrive soon. By then, we will know what this is all about."</p><p></p><p>Hearing Zhao Gao say this, Huhai exclaimed in surprise, "Moyu Qilin? Is it the Moyu Qilin who was once known as the number one assassin in Han?"</p><p></p><p>Zhao Gao nodded, confirming what Huhai said.</p><p></p><p>Dark moon and cold wind, nameless death, ever-changing, Moyu Qilin.</p><p></p><p>With her taking action, no matter who is behind Concubine Shu, they will definitely have nowhere to hide in front of Moyu Qilin.</p><p></p><p>Even a fool like Huhai had heard of Moyu Qilin's reputation.</p><p></p><p>With such a master helping him, how could a mere Concubine Shu possibly resist!</p><p></p><p>Moyu Qilin will definitely fulfill his wish!</p><p></p><p>Huhai firmly believed this, and he was overjoyed, feeling that victory was already in his grasp!</p><p></p><p>"When we find the person behind Concubine Shu, hand him over to me, and I will kill him with my own hands! Let him know the consequences of crossing this prince!"</p><p></p><p>Huhai could not wait for that day to come.</p><p></p><p>Zhao Gao smiled slightly, a strange smile on his face.</p><p></p><p>"Of course, no problem, Your Highness."</p><p></p><p>PS: Asking for flowers, rating tickets, comments, monthly tickets, rewards, thank you to all the ancestors!</p><p></p><p>Three things about reading: read, collect, and reward!</p>

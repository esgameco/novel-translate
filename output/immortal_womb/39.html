        <h1>Chapter 39</h1>
        <div class="content">
            <p>Ying Zheng originally thought that among the various schools of thought, only the stubborn Mohists harbored ill intentions.</p><p></p><p>This was something he had known for several years.</p><p></p><p>But after hearing Ying Chen's inner thoughts, he realized that things might not be as they seemed.</p><p></p><p>He never imagined that there were so many people with malicious intentions hiding in the shadows!</p><p></p><p>Even the seemingly peaceful Confucians had such thoughts!</p><p></p><p>And the Agriculturalists, the school with the largest number of followers among the hundred schools of thought!</p><p></p><p>They also had ambitions to overthrow the Qin Dynasty?!</p><p></p><p>Moreover, when did these people collude with each other?</p><p></p><p>Why had he never received such information before?</p><p></p><p>Ying Zheng was both shocked and angry.</p><p></p><p>He thought that after unifying the six states, the days of war would end and peace would come.</p><p></p><p>But why were these people not content with their good lives and insisting on harboring thoughts of rebelling against the Qin Dynasty?</p><p></p><p>It seemed that although the Qin Dynasty had superficially unified the six states, there were actually undercurrents surging beneath the surface.</p><p></p><p>They had not truly submitted to him from the bottom of their hearts!</p><p></p><p>However, things were not too bad.</p><p></p><p>At least now he knew about their hidden schemes.</p><p></p><p>Since he knew, he could respond accordingly.</p><p></p><p>Perhaps this was a good opportunity to eradicate these hidden anti-Qin forces.</p><p></p><p>The development of this series of events would ultimately benefit his Qin Dynasty!</p><p></p><p>What he needed to do now was to seize this opportunity of Wei Zhuang's imprisonment to root out those people!</p><p></p><p>Thinking of this, Ying Zheng was filled with ambition.</p><p></p><p>His gaze swept over the abdomen of his concubine, and he deliberately asked Zhang Han.</p><p></p><p>"Zhang Han, do you think the people of Liusha will give up on Wei Zhuang? If they still want to save him and have found powerful helpers, what should I do?"</p><p></p><p>Zhang Han frowned in thought.</p><p></p><p>This question was not easy to answer.</p><p></p><p>Based on the instinct of normal people to seek benefits and avoid harm, they would definitely give up on Wei Zhuang.</p><p></p><p>But Liusha was not ordinary.</p><p></p><p>The people there all worshipped Wei Zhuang, and there was a high possibility that they would not give up.</p><p></p><p>As for finding helpers, who would they go to?</p><p></p><p>Zhang Han had not yet figured out the answer to this question.</p><p></p><p>On the other side, Ying Chen, who heard their conversation, had already figured out the answers to these questions.</p><p></p><p>[What's so difficult about this? Put drugs in the food for Gai Nie and Wei Zhuang, first disable their martial arts, and then send the Luo Wang guards to guard the Shi Ya Prison.]</p><p></p><p>[Even if Luo Wang harbors ill intentions, they dare not openly rebel. At that time, let Luo Wang and the enemy consume each other for a while, and then let the enemy rescue Gai Nie and Wei Zhuang.]</p><p></p><p>[Not only can we take the opportunity to punish Zhao Gao for his crimes, but we can also turn the tables and find the enemy's lair, catching them all in one net.]</p><p></p><p>After hearing the entire plan, Ying Zheng was a little stunned.</p><p></p><p>They could play like this?</p><p></p><p>This brat...</p><p></p><p>Here is the full translation of the Chinese excerpt into English:</p><p></p><p>Wow, I didn't expect it, how sinister!</p><p></p><p>He not only took advantage of the trap, but also exploited Gai Nie, the Mohists, and that group of people thoroughly!</p><p></p><p>He almost exploited every single person to the fullest!</p><p></p><p>In the midst of this, his own people had it the easiest.</p><p></p><p>How on earth did he come up with this?</p><p></p><p>Using drugs is an unethical means in the martial world, to the extent that no matter who in the martial world you ask, they would call it despicable.</p><p></p><p>Not to mention the series of crafty moves afterwards.</p><p></p><p>This kid has more tricks up his sleeve than a fishing net has holes!</p><p></p><p>Unethical? But the effect is certainly good!</p><p></p><p>Despicable? But the price paid is small!</p><p></p><p>No matter how nasty the scolding, as long as the strategy works, it's fine!</p><p></p><p>Very good! He likes it a lot!</p><p></p><p>This method is not bad, he will adopt it!</p><p></p><p>This matter will be handled according to this kid's approach.</p><p></p><p>When the time comes, watching them fight against each other while his Shadow Night Guards reap the benefits like a fisherman, it will be simply delightful.</p><p></p><p>Ying Zheng's eyes lit up, he laughed and stood up, patting Zhang Han's shoulder and said, "Let's do it this way!"</p><p></p><p>The caught off guard Zhang Han was stunned.</p><p></p><p>Do what this way?</p><p></p><p>How to do it? Which way?</p><p></p><p>He hadn't said anything yet.</p><p></p><p>How was it already decided?</p><p></p><p>Ying Zheng had no time to answer Zhang Han's confusion.</p><p></p><p>He looked at Shu Fei and suddenly said, "Shu Fei's attire and makeup today are quite good, quite stylish, promote her rank to Liang Ren."</p><p></p><p>Hearing that she was receiving another reward, Shu Fei was overjoyed and thanked for the grace, "Thank you, Your Majesty, for your generous favor."</p><p></p><p>The surrounding attending eunuchs and palace maids were dumbfounded.</p><p></p><p>Attire and makeup are quite good?</p><p></p><p>This can also be the reason for Shu Fei's promotion?</p><p></p><p>Obviously, Shu Fei's outfit today is very normal!</p><p></p><p>Is His Majesty seeing his lover through rose-colored glasses?</p><p></p><p>In fact, he just wants to directly promote Shu Fei and randomly found a reason, right?</p><p></p><p>The palace maids and eunuchs felt they had found the answer.</p><p></p><p>They secretly made up their minds that in the future they must serve Shu Fei well.</p><p></p><p>They must not slight her and displease her.</p><p></p><p>Ying Zheng did not know that his small action had many interpretations in the eyes of the palace maids and eunuchs.</p><p></p><p>He was in a very good mood now.</p><p></p><p>With this, Shu Fei got a promotion in rank, and he got a satisfactory answer.</p><p></p><p>They both got what they wanted, this was a perfect win-win.</p><p></p><p>Having solved another big issue on his mind, Ying Zheng was very satisfied.</p><p></p><p>He strode forward, taking Zhang Han with him as he left.</p><p></p><p>Ying Chen was a little puzzled by Ying Zheng's actions.</p><p></p><p>[What does Brother Zheng mean by this? Coming to Shu Fei's palace just to hear Zhang Han's report and then promote Mother's rank? What's wrong with him?]</p><p></p><p>PS: Asking for flowers, rating tickets, comments, monthly tickets, rewards, thank you to all the handsome readers!</p><p></p><p>The three things about reading: read, collect, and reward!</p>

            <p>Regarding the suitable candidate, Zhang Liang already had his own considerations.</p><p></p><p>Zhang Liang spoke, "Apart from myself, I think the other two most suitable candidates are Bai Fenghuang and Dao Zhi."</p><p></p><p>Upon hearing this, everyone looked towards the two people mentioned by Zhang Liang.</p><p></p><p>"Why them?"</p><p></p><p>Even Bai Fenghuang and Dao Zhi, who were mentioned, were very surprised themselves.</p><p></p><p>Bai Fenghuang felt that it would be inconvenient for her to move around with her pet in the narrow Shi Ya Prison.</p><p></p><p>Dao Zhi believed that apart from his lightness skill, his overall strength was still superior to the others.</p><p></p><p>Faced with everyone's doubts,</p><p></p><p>Zhang Liang explained, "This time, our main task is to rescue people, not to kill. You two are both skilled in lightness techniques, very suitable for moving around in Shi Ya Prison."</p><p></p><p>"Moreover, Dao Zhi has a strong memory. Coupled with my research on the art of Qimen Dunjia, the two of us working together can deduce the correct passages in Shi Ya Prison. Therefore, the three of us are the best candidates for the rescue mission."</p><p></p><p>With the reasons explained as such, everyone was much more convinced.</p><p></p><p>Chi Lian frowned, "Then what about us? Just waiting here for you to come back?"</p><p></p><p>The thought of Wei Zhuang possibly being surrounded and injured made Chi Lian anxious.</p><p></p><p>She wished she could go and rescue him right away.</p><p></p><p>She really couldn't bear to just sit there and wait.</p><p></p><p>Zhang Liang understood her feelings and said, "Of course not. Although Zhang Heng and the Yin-Yang masters will not be stationed at Shi Ya Prison for long, it's better to be prepared for the worst case scenario of them guarding there."</p><p></p><p>"Speaking of which, I wonder if you all in Liu Sha have noticed that the recent actions of Qin always give a strange feeling."</p><p></p><p>"According to my guess, there is still a mysterious person behind Ying Zheng, planning everything. Your task is to be prepared to deal with unexpected enemies and block off unforeseen opponents."</p><p></p><p>In other words, the others were potential backup forces.</p><p></p><p>If the actual situation differed from Zhang Liang's expectations, then it would be time for the others to take the stage.</p><p></p><p>This was Zhang Liang's insurance measure to prevent the entire army from being wiped out.</p><p></p><p>Using the minimum number of people to obtain the maximum results, minimizing the possibility of casualties on their side, and flexibly adapting according to the actual situation.</p><p></p><p>This way, neither Liu Sha nor Mo Jia would have distrust due to how much they contributed.</p><p></p><p>The people of Liu Sha had no objections to this.</p><p></p><p>The leaders of Mo Jia looked towards Mo Jia Ju Zi.</p><p></p><p>Mo Jia Ju Zi nodded, indicating agreement with Zhang Liang's plan.</p><p></p><p>On the other side, in Shi Ya Prison, the few people who entered were still unaware that Liu Sha and Mo Jia had formed a cooperation.</p><p></p><p>Gai Nie sighed deeply and said to Wei Zhuang in the adjacent cell, "...</p><p></p><p>Here is the full English translation of the Chinese novel excerpt:</p><p></p><p>"Xiaozhuang, you shouldn't have come to save me."</p><p></p><p>Weizhuang snorted coldly and mocked, "Senior Brother, don't think too much. I came here to save Liner, not to save you."</p><p></p><p>Moyu Qilin, who was listening to their conversation on the side, couldn't help but roll his eyes and started silently complaining in his heart. </p><p></p><p>His master was really stubborn at this time.</p><p></p><p>Obviously, when he heard that Genie was captured, he couldn't wait to lead people to rescue him immediately,</p><p></p><p>And for this, he had to agree to cooperate with Luowang to obtain intelligence on Shiya Prison.</p><p></p><p>All of this, wasn't it all for the purpose of rescuing Genie?</p><p></p><p>Now it's good, saying it's for her?</p><p></p><p>I'm afraid you wouldn't believe it yourself if you said these words, right?</p><p></p><p>On the other side, Shengqi heard them talking and said gleefully, "No matter who comes, it's impossible to escape from this prison. I advise you to give up the idea of escaping from prison as soon as possible."</p><p></p><p>"But the more people you bring, the happier I am. When there are many people, we can talk, at least this way I won't be bored alone."</p><p></p><p>Shengqi was probably the only one among the few who still maintained a good state of mind.</p><p></p><p>It has to be said that after staying in prison for a long time, one will adapt to it.</p><p></p><p>Outside Shiya Prison, Yanri, Jingni, and Liujiannnu were guarding the door.</p><p></p><p>Seeing the dress of the few, the jailer knew that they were not easy to provoke, and couldn't help but become attentive.</p><p></p><p>"Lords, do you want to go in? There are seats inside, you can rest for a while."</p><p></p><p>Yanri shook his head and said in a low voice, "No need, we can just wait here."</p><p></p><p>They were not so easily tired.</p><p></p><p>Moreover, if they went in now, wouldn't they just run into Weizhuang?</p><p></p><p>Weizhuang was ambushed and imprisoned, and now he probably already held a grudge against Luowang.</p><p></p><p>Seeing their existence, if he got angry and disregarded everything and revealed the deal between Liusha and Luowang, how could they explain it?</p><p></p><p>The jailers here and the people of Yingmiwei were not dead.</p><p></p><p>Let them hear that Luowang secretly colluded with Liusha to spy on the rear palace?</p><p></p><p>That was simply a merit delivered to their hands!</p><p></p><p>They would immediately report it to the First Emperor.</p><p></p><p>The betrayal of the close guards by his side, that was the First Emperor's taboo!</p><p></p><p>It was enough for them to die a thousand and ten thousand times for a felony!</p><p></p><p>Especially since the emperor had already experienced Genie's betrayal, he no longer had 100% pure trust in others.</p><p></p><p>If Luowang touched this bad luck at this point, they would definitely die miserably.</p><p></p><p>Therefore, in order not to complicate matters, it was better for Luowang's people to wait here.</p><p></p><p>After being rejected, the jailer retreated in embarrassment.</p>

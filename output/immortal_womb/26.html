        <h1>Chapter 26</h1>
        <div class="content">
            <p>Moyu Qilin didn't expect her true identity to be exposed.</p><p></p><p>Instantly, the hair all over her body stood on end.</p><p></p><p>She widened her eyes and scanned her surroundings, desperately sensing the aura around her.</p><p></p><p>But no matter how hard she tried, the result was the same.</p><p></p><p>She didn't detect anyone's presence nearby.</p><p></p><p>Moyu Qilin found it hard to believe.</p><p></p><p>She asked, "Who are you?! When exactly did you discover me?!"</p><p></p><p>Ying Chen's voice was steady and calm, "From the moment you appeared before me, you were already exposed."</p><p></p><p>Receiving such an answer, Moyu Qilin's first reaction was disbelief.</p><p></p><p>Her disguise technique was the best in the world, how could she be exposed as soon as she appeared?</p><p></p><p>In this world, so far, there was no one who could see through her disguise technique!</p><p></p><p>This person must be bluffing her! He was just putting on a show!</p><p></p><p>Having never encountered setbacks, Moyu Qilin was too confident in her disguise technique.</p><p></p><p>She couldn't believe that she had failed so easily.</p><p></p><p>Ying Chen could easily see what Moyu Qilin was thinking.</p><p></p><p>He chuckled, "Your disguise technique is indeed ingenious, but in front of me, it's full of illusions everywhere, so fragile that it breaks with just a light prick."</p><p></p><p>Prick?</p><p></p><p>Hearing this word, Moyu Qilin was stunned for a moment.</p><p></p><p>Then she suddenly remembered something.</p><p></p><p>During the day in Shu Fei's palace, when she was lighting incense, she felt something unusual at that time.</p><p></p><p>Although it was only for an instant, her disguise technique had indeed stagnated!</p><p></p><p>Could it be that this person made a move?</p><p></p><p>In an instant, her face turned pale.</p><p></p><p>Moyu Qilin said in realization, "When I was lighting the incense, it was you who made a move! It was you who affected my disguise technique?"</p><p></p><p>Ying Chen calmly affirmed, "Being able to remember, you're not too stupid. Tell me, who sent you?"</p><p></p><p>Although Ying Chen already had a guess in his heart, he still wanted to get the answer from Moyu Qilin's mouth.</p><p></p><p>Moyu Qilin remained silent on this question.</p><p></p><p>In just a few short seconds, she thought a lot.</p><p></p><p>If her disguise technique was broken, wouldn't she be completely exposed in front of this mysterious person?</p><p></p><p>Doesn't that mean all her actions so far have been seen by him?</p><p></p><p>And she herself was completely unaware of this person who had been quietly observing her?</p><p></p><p>If it weren't for this person speaking up, she wouldn't even know of his existence!</p><p></p><p>Too terrifying!</p><p></p><p>Such an opponent is too terrifying!</p><p></p><p>There was actually such a master hidden in the rear palace!</p><p></p><p>No wonder that Jing Ni didn't even have time to make a move before being discovered.</p><p></p><p>This person's...</p><p></p><p>Here is the full translation of the Chinese excerpt into English:</p><p></p><p>Her cultivation was far above his own.</p><p></p><p>Even if they fought, she was definitely not a match for this person!</p><p></p><p>In an instant, Mo Yuqilin had assessed the other party's strength and had the intention to retreat.</p><p></p><p>She could not stay here, she must leave this place and immediately pass on this intelligence!</p><p></p><p>Thinking this in her heart, Mo Yuqilin suddenly began to move.</p><p></p><p>With a swift speed, she fled towards the outside of the palace!</p><p></p><p>However, soon after, she discovered to her horror that no matter where she fled to,</p><p></p><p>That voice always followed her closely like a parasite.</p><p></p><p>Just like a cat catching a mouse, it always maintained a fixed distance, teasing her.</p><p></p><p>As if telling her that everything she did was in vain!</p><p></p><p>She simply could not shake off this person!</p><p></p><p>Fear gradually gripped Mo Yuqilin's heart.</p><p></p><p>She tried her best to cast aside the distracting thoughts in her mind, and escape from the imperial palace first before thinking of anything else.</p><p></p><p>So Mo Yuqilin chose to ignore that voice and instead tried her best to run towards the outside of the imperial palace.</p><p></p><p>As long as she got outside, with someone supporting her, she would still have a glimmer of hope.</p><p></p><p>Unfortunately, the hope she held onto was all illusory, and had never existed from the beginning.</p><p></p><p>Just as Mo Yuqilin was about to escape from the rear palace,</p><p></p><p>Ying Chen opened his mouth and crushed her only remaining hope, saying, "It seems you don't intend to speak. Since that's the case, then stay here."</p><p></p><p>In any case, those who sent her were nothing more than Flowing Sand, Luo Wang, Yin Yang family, or at worst those anti-Qin forces.</p><p></p><p>Afterwards, he could investigate it himself.</p><p></p><p>Then, Ying Chen's voice turned cold as he spat out the word "kill".</p><p></p><p>That "kill" filled with murderous aura exploded in Mo Yuqilin's mind along with the transmitted sound!</p><p></p><p>It was as if a small bomb had suddenly been detonated in her brain!</p><p></p><p>Mo Yuqilin simply could not withstand such an impact.</p><p></p><p>In an instant, blood flowed out from her seven apertures!</p><p></p><p>Mo Yuqilin's vision went black, her head spun and she instantly lost consciousness, her breathing disordered as she rolled off the roof.</p><p></p><p>The Shadow Guards patrolling outside the rear palace heard such a commotion and all drew their weapons at their waists.</p><p></p><p>They shouted, "Who goes there?!"</p><p></p><p>Hearing no response, the Shadow Guards directly headed towards the direction of the sound.</p><p></p><p>Then at once they saw a suspicious woman, bleeding from her seven apertures, lying on the ground.</p><p></p><p>The Shadow Guards quickly stepped forward to subdue Mo Yuqilin.</p><p></p><p>Seeing that Mo Yuqilin had already been captured by the Shadow Guards, Ying Chen retracted his divine sense.</p><p></p><p>Leave the rest for the Shadow Guards to handle.</p><p></p><p>PS: Asking for flowers, rating tickets, comments, monthly tickets, rewards, thanks to all the handsome readers!</p><p></p><p>The three things about reading: read, collect, and reward!</p>

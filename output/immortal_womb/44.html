        <div class="content">
            <p>Here is the full English translation of the Chinese novel excerpt:</p><p></p><p>After Zhang Liang, Liu Sha and the Mohists finalized their plan, they arrived near the Shi Ya Prison. </p><p></p><p>Worried about encountering an ambush by the Shadow Guards and the Yin-Yang Sect, Zhang Liang, the Mohists, and Liu Sha's group were very cautious and first scouted the surrounding area.</p><p></p><p>This investigation uncovered an alarming discovery - they actually found traces of the Luo Wang nearby!</p><p></p><p>Not only were there six Sword Slaves guarding the area, but Yan Ri and Jing Ni were there as well!  </p><p></p><p>What was the Luo Wang doing here? </p><p></p><p>Could it be that they had already anticipated that Liu Sha would not abandon Wei Zhuang, so they were waiting here in advance to prevent them from coming to rescue Wei Zhuang?</p><p></p><p>Capturing Wei Zhuang alone was not enough, they really wanted to completely exterminate Liu Sha's group and catch them all in one net!</p><p></p><p>Thinking this way, Liu Sha's group was instantly furious!</p><p></p><p>This further confirmed the suspicions in the minds of Liu Sha's group!</p><p></p><p>The people of the Luo Wang had betrayed them! </p><p></p><p>They were after Liu Sha's life!</p><p></p><p>Compared to the enraged Liu Sha, the observer Zhang Liang was much calmer.</p><p></p><p>He felt that the Luo Wang's appearance here was not targeting Liu Sha, but may have just been following the Emperor's orders.</p><p></p><p>But this was only his guess, he had no evidence, and he definitely could not get an answer from the Luo Wang.</p><p></p><p>Therefore, he remained silent and did not say much.</p><p></p><p>Chi Lian and the others' dissatisfaction with the Luo Wang had reached its peak at this time.</p><p></p><p>Chi Lian said hatefully: "I must teach the people of the Luo Wang a lesson, especially that bastard Yan Ri!"</p><p></p><p>The others echoed: "Me too, that Yan Ri guy had evil intentions from the beginning, I won't let him off."</p><p></p><p>"The entire Luo Wang is dirty, we should annihilate them all!"</p><p></p><p>The Liu Sha group was impassioned, and angry emotions were spreading among them.</p><p></p><p>Seeing their situation, Zhang Liang knew that his words could no longer stop them.</p><p></p><p>After all, he was not a member of Liu Sha, just an outsider, and had no real standing to say anything.</p><p></p><p>So Zhang Liang could only warn everyone: "Pay attention to safety, don't act impulsively, safety first in everything."</p><p></p><p>Everyone responded in unison.</p><p></p><p>Next, everyone discussed and began to assign tasks.</p><p></p><p>Liu Sha and the Luo Wang had a great grudge, so they took the initiative to deal with Yan Ri and Jing Ni.</p><p></p><p>The other Mohists would take advantage of Yan Ri and Jing Ni being drawn away to deal with the six Sword Slaves.</p><p></p><p>Meanwhile, Zhang Liang, Bai Fenghuang, and Dao Zhi would sneak into the Shi Ya Prison while they were fighting.</p><p></p><p>After the tasks were assigned, everyone dispersed and began to carry out their respective tasks.</p><p></p><p>Chi Lian, Wu Shuang Gui, Cang Lang Wang, and Yin Fu took the initiative to appear in front of the Luo Wang.</p><p></p><p>They opened their mouths to provoke: "Yan Ri, you still have the face to appear here shamelessly?!"</p><p></p><p>"You like being a running dog so much? Ying Zheng..."</p><p></p><p>Here is the full translation of the Chinese excerpt into English:</p><p></p><p>"What on earth did they promise you?"</p><p></p><p>"To come up with such a despicable and shameless idea is truly disgusting!"</p><p></p><p>Yanri could hear the deep hatred Liusha's people had for him.</p><p></p><p>He thought they had come to settle scores for the transaction.</p><p></p><p>What did it have to do with him that Wei Zhuang was caught because of the ambush?</p><p></p><p>The intelligence he provided about the Shi Ya Prison was real.</p><p></p><p>He even specially gave it to Liusha when Moyu Qilin didn't provide any intelligence at all.</p><p></p><p>Not only was Liusha ungrateful, but now they were even blaming Wei Zhuang's matter on him?</p><p></p><p>Wei Zhuang getting caught could only be due to his own lack of strength, what did it have to do with him?</p><p></p><p>He wasn't Liusha's nanny, and had no obligation to wipe their asses for them!</p><p></p><p>But Yanri didn't bother to explain for himself, he said coldly: "Luowang did not betray Liusha, if you know what's good for you, you'd better hurry up and scram, otherwise you'll be caught and thrown into Shi Ya Prison along with them."</p><p></p><p>Not only did they imprison Moyu Qilin, they even caused Wei Zhuang to be ambushed, and this wasn't considered a betrayal?</p><p></p><p>Did they have to wait until all of Liusha's people were caught and imprisoned in Shi Ya Prison before it would be considered a betrayal?</p><p></p><p>Liusha's people were furious beyond measure.</p><p></p><p>Chi Lian didn't want to waste words, and directly summoned her snake swarm.</p><p></p><p>In an instant, a dense mass of snakes appeared in great numbers from all directions, giving off a strange luster under the sunlight.</p><p></p><p>These snakes were clearly all venomous at a glance!</p><p></p><p>The kind of venom that could kill a person with a single touch!</p><p></p><p>The venomous snakes slithered and crawled, sinisterly flicking their forked tongues at Luowang's people.</p><p></p><p>As soon as they entered the attack range, they attacked Luowang's people!</p><p></p><p>This woman Chi Lian, she was serious!</p><p></p><p>She actually really wanted to attack them!</p><p></p><p>These Liusha people really didn't understand reason, they were accusing the wrong party!</p><p></p><p>Yanri was instantly enraged.</p><p></p><p>He immediately drew his sword and slashed off the few venomous snakes attacking him.</p><p></p><p>Then he gave the order: "Six Sword Slaves, you stay here and don't let anyone approach, Jing Ni, you come with me and help me defeat these people."</p><p></p><p>The Six Sword Slaves obeyed the order and stayed where they were.</p><p></p><p>Jing Ni followed Yanri and launched an attack on Liusha's people.</p><p></p><p>Seeing Yanri and Jing Ni's actions, Liusha's people knew they had taken the bait according to plan.</p><p></p><p>They exchanged a tacit glance with each other and immediately retreated, widening the distance between them and Yanri and Jing Ni.</p><p></p><p>Yanri had already been provoked to anger by Liusha and wouldn't let them go.</p><p></p><p>Seeing them retreat, he didn't stop and pursued them together with Jing Ni.</p><p></p><p>Just like that, Liusha's people led Yanri and Jing Ni bit by bit, far away from Shi Ya Prison.</p><p></p><p>PS: Asking for flowers, rating tickets, comments, monthly tickets, rewards, thanks to all the handsome readers!</p><p></p><p>The three things about reading: read, collect, and reward!</p>

        <h1>Chapter 61</h1>
        <div class="content">
            <p>Ying Chen came before Shao Siming and raised his hand, saying calmly, "Now, it's your turn."</p><p></p><p>Upon hearing these words, Shao Siming's face was filled with horror as she kept retreating.</p><p></p><p>Like a frightened, puffed-up kitten, she kept backing away while staring at him vigilantly, ready to seize any opportunity to fight back.</p><p></p><p>Seeing her in this state, Ying Chen said helplessly, "Why are you making me out to be the villain? You were the ones who barged into my mother's bedchamber."</p><p></p><p>Mother's bedchamber?</p><p></p><p>Shao Siming suddenly grasped this important keyword.</p><p></p><p>In an instant, a flash of lightning struck her mind.</p><p></p><p>Clearing away the thick fog, the puzzles that had long confounded everyone finally had an answer!</p><p></p><p>Shao Siming couldn't help but ask in a startled voice, "You are the child in Concubine Shu's womb?!"</p><p></p><p>Having his true identity exposed, Ying Chen wasn't flustered at all and just smiled faintly.</p><p></p><p>"Congratulations on guessing correctly, but the reward for guessing the right answer is: from now on, you will have to submit to me."</p><p></p><p>Shao Siming was shocked beyond belief upon receiving the affirmative answer from Ying Chen.</p><p></p><p>How could this be possible?</p><p></p><p>How could an unborn child possess such wisdom? And such martial prowess?</p><p></p><p>Could it be that the recent series of events were all caused by this child?</p><p></p><p>So there was never any expert behind Concubine Shu!</p><p></p><p>Everything was done by this unborn child before her eyes!</p><p></p><p>Who could have thought of this answer?!</p><p></p><p>The truth was too shocking for anyone to accept in this brief moment.</p><p></p><p>Shao Siming's body trembled slightly, wanting to stand up and leave this place to relay the truth back to the Yin-Yang family.</p><p></p><p>Unfortunately, she had no chance to send any message back.</p><p></p><p>Almost the instant she made a move, Ying Chen took action!</p><p></p><p>Without any hesitation, he directly extracted Shao Siming's soul.</p><p></p><p>With the previous opportunity of dealing with Da Siming as a foundation, Ying Chen's movements were incredibly skilled this time.</p><p></p><p>Shao Siming's body collapsed to the ground after her soul was extracted.</p><p></p><p>After extracting the soul, the next step for Ying Chen was to modify Shao Siming's cognition.</p><p></p><p>However, just as Ying Chen was about to modify her cognition, he discovered an amazing phenomenon.</p><p></p><p>Shao Siming's memories were actually sealed!</p><p></p><p>Ying Chen inwardly mused how interesting this was.</p><p></p><p>It seemed that the Yin-Yang family also had secret techniques that could affect the soul.</p><p></p><p>If given the chance, he wouldn't mind meeting Dong Huang Taiyi to see what this fellow was all about and what secrets he held.</p><p></p><p>As for this sealed portion of Shao Siming's memories, Ying Chen didn't rashly undo it.</p><p></p><p>Not knowing the contents inside, if he carelessly undid the seal, there was no telling what changes Shao Siming would undergo.</p><p></p><p>Moreover, on Dong Huang Taiyi's side...</p><p></p><p>Here is the full translation of the Chinese excerpt into English:</p><p></p><p>If it was discovered that the seal had been removed, they would certainly turn their attention to Shao Siming, which would startle the snake in the grass.</p><p></p><p>Therefore, Ying Chen did not remove the seal on Shao Siming.</p><p></p><p>Instead, he only modified Shao Siming's cognition.</p><p></p><p>Just like with Da Siming, he also modified Shao Siming's cognition to be his maid.</p><p></p><p>After the modification, he put the soul back into Shao Siming's body.</p><p></p><p>When Shao Siming opened her eyes and woke up, seeing Ying Chen, she also became obedient.</p><p></p><p>She slowly walked to Da Siming's side and knelt down side by side towards Ying Chen.</p><p></p><p>Ying Chen was very satisfied with his ability to modify cognition.</p><p></p><p>He began to order the two: "You will go back to the Yin-Yang family in a while, and then hide in the Yin-Yang family."</p><p></p><p>"As for the results of this investigation, just say that you encountered a mysterious person's attack in the harem and barely escaped after a difficult battle."</p><p></p><p>The excuse Ying Chen thought of for them was perfect.</p><p></p><p>You know, the highest state of telling a lie is seven parts truth and three parts falsehood.</p><p></p><p>After the previous battle, the two of them now had injuries on their bodies.</p><p></p><p>It can be said that except for his identity, everything else was true.</p><p></p><p>The group of people in the Yin-Yang family had no choice but to believe it.</p><p></p><p>Da Siming and Shao Siming replied respectfully, "We will obey the master's orders."</p><p></p><p>The two now completely regarded Ying Chen as their master.</p><p></p><p>No matter what Ying Chen said, they would do it.</p><p></p><p>Since everything had been arranged, and there was nothing else, Ying Chen ordered the two to leave.</p><p></p><p>The two women carefully avoided the guards along the way and left the harem.</p><p></p><p>After the two left, Ying Chen couldn't help yawning, feeling a wave of sleepiness coming over him.</p><p></p><p>He hadn't felt such a strong sleepiness in a long time.</p><p></p><p>This should be the side effect of his soul being out of his body for too long.</p><p></p><p>After being busy for so long, he really should have a good sleep.</p><p></p><p>Ying Chen controlled his soul to avoid the teams of guards.</p><p></p><p>He returned to Shu Fei's bedchamber.</p><p></p><p>The bedchamber was peaceful, and most people were still dreaming, just as it was when he left before.</p><p></p><p>Ying Chen put his mind at ease and returned his soul to his body.</p><p></p><p>Then, he fell into a deep sleep.</p><p></p><p>The sleeping Ying Chen was very relieved.</p><p></p><p>Because the palace was now tense.</p><p></p><p>The guards were almost straining every nerve in their bodies.</p><p></p><p>They were anxiously searching the area near where the sound had come from, hoping to find a clue to the assassin.</p><p></p><p>At this time, no matter which camp people in the harem belonged to, they dared not act rashly.</p><p></p><p>Unless they wanted to face Zheng Ge's storm of rage.</p><p></p><p>PS: Please give flowers, rating tickets, comments, monthly tickets, rewards, thanks to all the handsome readers!</p><p></p><p>Feilu Novels, Fei wants you

        <h1>Chapter 40</h1>
        <div class="content">
            <p>The news of Shu Fei's promotion to Liangren spread like wildfire within the palace, and then quickly made its way outside the palace walls.</p><p></p><p>At the residence of the eldest prince of the Great Qin, the news from Fusu's mother had already been received.</p><p></p><p>As soon as the news was announced, the scholars could not sit still.</p><p></p><p>"How did Shu Fei get promoted again?"</p><p></p><p>"Shu Fei's promotion speed is too terrifying!"</p><p></p><p>"Could it be that His Majesty is truly enchanted by her?"</p><p></p><p>The scholars felt an unprecedented sense of crisis in their hearts.</p><p></p><p>If the previous two promotions were just a momentary whim, then this third one clearly told them that it was not the case at all!</p><p></p><p>His Majesty the Emperor was openly telling everyone that he was favoring Shu Fei exclusively!</p><p></p><p>If it were any other concubine, it would be fine, but this Shu Fei, she was already carrying a child in her belly!</p><p></p><p>During pregnancy, one cannot engage in intercourse, yet despite this, the Emperor would rather not seek out other concubines and insist on going to Shu Fei, which shows how great his favor is?!</p><p></p><p>If Shu Fei safely gives birth to the child later on, wouldn't this favor become even more powerful?</p><p></p><p>If this continues, the Emperor's love for her will extend to her child, and he will certainly treat the child born to Shu Fei generously.</p><p></p><p>With Shu Fei whispering in the Emperor's ear from the harem, the future of this child will be limitless!</p><p></p><p>By then, even the eldest prince might have to avoid his sharp edge in front of him!</p><p></p><p>Just thinking about the future, this group of scholars felt it was terrifying.</p><p></p><p>They must make the eldest prince Fusu take this matter seriously!</p><p></p><p>He can no longer turn a blind eye to it like before!</p><p></p><p>Therefore, the scholars surrounded Fusu and began to advise him.</p><p></p><p>"Eldest Prince, this cannot go on!"</p><p></p><p>"Shu Fei's promotion speed is too abnormal!"</p><p></p><p>"Eldest Prince, if Shu Fei continues to be promoted, the child she gives birth to in the future may affect you!"</p><p></p><p>At this time, Fusu also felt that something was amiss.</p><p></p><p>Shu Fei had been promoted several times in less than a month, and this speed could be said to be unprecedented.</p><p></p><p>In the harem, no woman had such speed for so many years.</p><p></p><p>His Majesty had never favored a particular woman before, let alone continuously promoting a woman's rank.</p><p></p><p>Shu Fei's promotion speed did not slow down at all after the first two times, but instead became faster and faster.</p><p></p><p>What should be done if Shu Fei is promoted again?</p><p></p><p>Thinking of this question, Fusu sighed while holding his forehead, "The affairs of the harem are Father Emperor's matters, what can I do? It's not good to intervene, right?"</p><p></p><p>The scholars were stumped by Fusu's question.</p><p></p><p>The facts were indeed as Fusu said.</p><p></p><p>In this world, where does a son manage his father's women?</p><p></p><p>Especially in the imperial family.</p><p></p><p>As a son, the harem is a place that these princes cannot touch even more so.</p><p></p><p>Here is the full translation of the Chinese excerpt into English:</p><p></p><p>Even though these Confucian scholars were usually full of ideas, when it came to the imperial harem, they were all at a loss.</p><p></p><p>Even if they had countless strategies in their hearts, those were prepared for political rivals in the court.</p><p></p><p>Not for women.</p><p></p><p>No minister single-mindedly focused on using tactics against the women in the imperial harem.</p><p></p><p>Besides the reason that it was not easy for them to intervene, there was another matter they worried about.</p><p></p><p>His Majesty's temperament was extremely domineering. If he knew that a minister dared to reach his hand into the imperial harem, he would certainly be furious.</p><p></p><p>When the Son of Heaven is enraged, corpses would pile up in the hundreds of thousands. </p><p></p><p>Based on His Majesty's temperament, he might directly issue an order to execute entire families.</p><p></p><p>Thinking of this terrible consequence, those agitated Confucian scholars immediately calmed down quite a bit.</p><p></p><p>Although they favored Fusu and were willing to assist him, they could not joke around with the lives of their entire families, right?</p><p></p><p>Just like that, Fusu's residence fell into a temporary deadlock.</p><p></p><p>The residence of Qin's Eighteen Princes on the other side was not so calm.</p><p></p><p>When Huhai learned the news of Concubine Shu being promoted to Liangren, anger directly rushed from his heart to the top of his head.</p><p></p><p>"What thing? She also dares to rise up like this?"</p><p></p><p>Huhai had a hot-tempered personality. When he got angry, boundless cruel desires would well up in him.</p><p></p><p>He swept everything on the table to the ground, then kicked over the table with one foot.</p><p></p><p>The clattering sounds were incessant.</p><p></p><p>The servants knelt to one side, trembling with fear, afraid of suffering collateral damage.</p><p></p><p>Huhai took out his anger on the objects in the entire room, still not relieving his hatred.</p><p></p><p>His vicious gaze turned to those servants.</p><p></p><p>The servants wished they could bury their heads into the ground.</p><p></p><p>Afraid of being noticed by Huhai.</p><p></p><p>But Huhai still picked out a male servant from among them and directly kicked him!</p><p></p><p>The male servant was immediately sent flying!</p><p></p><p>Crashing into the wall, he kept spitting up blood.</p><p></p><p>Seeing the male servant's pained appearance, only then did Huhai feel his heart become a bit more at ease.</p><p></p><p>Zhao Gao calmly watched from the side, not stopping Huhai.</p><p></p><p>He knew Huhai needed to vent.</p><p></p><p>After fully venting, Huhai looked toward Zhao Gao and asked, "Zhao Gao, what should be done? If this continues, Concubine Shu will very quickly catch up to and even surpass Mother Concubine!"</p><p></p><p>"This prince absolutely will not allow Concubine Shu to go above my mother concubine!"</p><p></p><p>Huhai said this while gritting his teeth.</p><p></p><p>Clearly, he had now listed Concubine Shu as the number one object of his hatred.</p><p></p><p>Zhao Gao's gaze was vicious as he sinisterly said, "The prince can rest assured, leave this matter for this old servant to handle. For a couple people to die in the imperial harem is a very normal thing."</p><p></p><p>PS: Asking for flowers, rating tickets, comments, monthly tickets, rewards, thanks to the gentlemen!</p><p></p><p>Feilu Novels, Fei wants you to have a good read!</p>

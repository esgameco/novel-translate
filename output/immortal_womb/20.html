        <h1>Chapter 20</h1>
        <div class="content">
            <p>Another side of the Yin-Yang family was still unaware of what happened after Lord Yunzhong left, and how Ying Zheng used ants to test the medicine for poison.</p><p></p><p>After presenting the elixir, Lord Yunzhong met Dong Huang Taiyi.</p><p></p><p>The Moon Goddess was also there.</p><p></p><p>Dong Huang Taiyi was still dressed in all black, looking mysterious and unfathomable.</p><p></p><p>He looked at Lord Yunzhong and asked, "The elixir, did you give it to Ying Zheng?"</p><p></p><p>Lord Yunzhong thought of the bizarre series of events that had just occurred and felt that there was no point in hiding anything, so he spoke directly.</p><p></p><p>With a bitter smile on his face, he said, "I have presented the elixir according to your instructions, and Ying Zheng accepted it at the time, but he did not consume it on the spot."</p><p></p><p>"I feel that he seemed... seemed to have become suspicious of the elixir."</p><p></p><p>Upon hearing Lord Yunzhong say this, Dong Huang Taiyi's voice instantly turned cold: "Why is this? Did you perhaps reveal something?"</p><p></p><p>Hearing Dong Huang Taiyi suspect him like this, Lord Yunzhong felt extremely wronged.</p><p></p><p>"How could that be? You know me, my every move is according to your instructions, Great Lord Dong Huang, I couldn't have revealed anything!"</p><p></p><p>If Lord Yunzhong did not reveal anything, how could Ying Zheng suddenly become suspicious for no reason? </p><p></p><p>In the past, he had never been suspicious and had always looked forward to the day the elixir would be completed.</p><p></p><p>Dong Huang Taiyi somewhat disbelieved Lord Yunzhong's words.</p><p></p><p>The Moon Goddess beside them pondered for a moment, thought of something, and joined the conversation.</p><p></p><p>"When Gai Nie defected before, Ying Zheng suddenly told us to ambush Gai Nie at Canyue Valley. Even we ourselves did not know that Gai Nie would pass through Canyue Valley."</p><p></p><p>"In fact, Ying Zheng was right, Gai Nie did indeed pass through Canyue Valley."</p><p></p><p>"Also, that papermaking technique of unknown origin was suddenly instructed by Ying Zheng for Meng Tian to create and promote to the people."</p><p></p><p>"Perhaps, there is someone we don't know about behind Ying Zheng, always planning for him."</p><p></p><p>Someone they don't know about?</p><p></p><p>Who else could there be here that they don't know about?</p><p></p><p>Although their Yin-Yang family's intelligence network was not as omnipresent as a seamless net, it was still very advanced.</p><p></p><p>So while this possibility seemed reasonable, upon closer examination, the likelihood was minuscule. </p><p></p><p>Because there was almost always someone from their Yin-Yang family by Ying Zheng's side.</p><p></p><p>They had never heard of him favoring any strategist recently.</p><p></p><p>Even if there really was such a person, there should be some traces.</p><p></p><p>How could there be no traces revealed even now?</p><p></p><p>As for the matter of the elixir, it was also a big problem.</p><p></p><p>It was an elixir they had specially prepared for Ying Zheng, and he must consume it.</p><p></p><p>Dong Huang Taiyi pondered deeply.</p><p></p><p>Here is the full English translation of the Chinese novel excerpt:</p><p></p><p>Mo was silent for a moment and said, "It's okay, I know about Ying Zheng's condition. His headache will become more and more severe."</p><p></p><p>"When he can't stand the pain, he will naturally take the medicine. It's only a matter of time."</p><p></p><p>Donhuang Taiyi's certain tone made Moon God and Cloud Lord feel slightly relieved. </p><p></p><p>Donhuang Taiyi was the supreme leader of the Yin-Yang Sect. His words carried great weight.</p><p></p><p>Seeing that Donhuang Taiyi had no intention of blaming him, Cloud Lord secretly breathed a sigh of relief. </p><p></p><p>He did not want to inexplicably take the blame, let alone receive punishment.</p><p></p><p>Admittedly, if it weren't for Ying Chen's appearance, Donhuang Taiyi's plot would have indeed succeeded.</p><p></p><p>Unfortunately, the current Ying Zheng no longer needed the elixir.</p><p></p><p>In Concubine Shu's palace, Ying Zheng was reviewing the memorials in his hands.</p><p></p><p>He marveled that the paper he invented was so easy to use, much more convenient than the previous bamboo slips.</p><p></p><p>Even after reading so many memorials, his wrists felt completely normal.</p><p></p><p>They even felt more energetic the more he used them.</p><p></p><p>This papermaking technique was truly a great invention.</p><p></p><p>His son, who learned it from who knows where, actually knew so many things.</p><p></p><p>At this moment, the Shadow Guards suddenly came to report.</p><p></p><p>Urgent reports came from the border that the Northern Barbarians were acting unusually!</p><p></p><p>Military affairs were urgent and could not be delayed. He had to handle it personally.</p><p></p><p>Ying Zheng had no choice but to leave.</p><p></p><p>However, before leaving, he wanted to do one more thing.</p><p></p><p>"Concubine Shu's massage skills are not bad. Promote Concubine Shu's rank to Bazi."</p><p></p><p>Ying Zheng calmly ordered the eunuch beside him.</p><p></p><p>Concubine Shu was pleasantly surprised. Relieving the Emperor's headache was originally part of her duties.</p><p></p><p>She never thought the Emperor would take this to heart.</p><p></p><p>She immediately knelt down to express her gratitude.</p><p></p><p>The eunuchs and palace maids present envied Concubine Shu's rocket-like promotion speed.</p><p></p><p>Only Ying Chen, who sensed everything with his divine consciousness, was very puzzled.</p><p></p><p>[What's gotten into Brother Zheng? He promoted her rank just for this small matter?]</p><p></p><p>[Are Mother's massage skills really that good? Or is it so simple to be promoted in the Qin Dynasty's harem?]</p><p></p><p>When Ying Zheng left, he heard Ying Chen's inner thoughts and couldn't help shaking his head.</p><p></p><p>He was full of complaints in his heart.</p><p></p><p>You little brat, still so rude!</p><p></p><p>Didn't I do all this for you?</p><p></p><p>In order to raise Concubine Shu's status, he racked his brains each time.</p><p></p><p>With Mother's status raised, your treatment as her son will get better and better.</p><p></p><p>I'm indirectly rewarding you, kid!</p><p></p><p>You really don't understand my painstaking efforts!</p><p></p><p>PS: Asking for flowers, rating tickets, comments, monthly tickets, rewards, thanks to all the handsome readers!</p><p></p><p>Feilu Novels, Fei wants you to have a good read!</p>

        <h1>Chapter 66</h1>
        <div class="content">
            <p>Here is the full translation of the Chinese excerpt into English:</p><p></p><p>After receiving this shocking news, the Mohists immediately decided to go and investigate the scene.</p><p></p><p>To ensure safety, the people of Flowing Sand stayed behind to guard Mirror Lake Medical Manor.</p><p></p><p>Even if there was danger, they had the strength to fight.</p><p></p><p>The Mohist leaders, led by the Mohist Giant, came to a relatively high location, and sure enough, they saw the dead Mohist disciple there.</p><p></p><p>Several people gathered to examine, hoping to find some clues.</p><p></p><p>After examining the wounds of the Mohist disciple, Gao Jianli's face looked grim: "The assailant was decisive, sealing the throat with one sword stroke. The opponent is no easy prey."</p><p></p><p>Snow Woman looked around and frowned: "From here, one can easily overlook Mirror Lake Medical Manor. Our position may have been exposed."</p><p></p><p>Seeing the tragic state of the dead Mohist disciple, Dao Zhi angrily said, "Who on earth is the other party? How dare they kill a disciple of our Mohist clan?"</p><p></p><p>Zhang Liang approached a tree not far from the corpse and found a piece of black torn cloth on a branch.</p><p></p><p>He took down that piece of black cloth and carefully examined it in the sunlight.</p><p></p><p>The fabric was thick, with dense stitching, and did not look like something ordinary people would use.</p><p></p><p>Dao Zhi noticed the cloth in Zhang Liang's hand and asked, "What cloth is this?"</p><p></p><p>Zhang Liang's face looked a bit grim as he explained, "If I'm not mistaken, this fabric is specially used by the Shadow Guards, convenient for them to hide in the night."</p><p></p><p>Hearing the term "Shadow Guards", the Mohists were greatly shocked: "Shadow Guards?! How did they find this place?"</p><p></p><p>The Mohist Giant said in a heavy voice, "It seems this place has been exposed. We can no longer stay here."</p><p></p><p>"Everyone, prepare to withdraw into the Mohist Mechanism City."</p><p></p><p>The crowd's expressions were solemn as they returned to Mirror Lake Medical Manor.</p><p></p><p>When the people of Flowing Sand and Duan Murong learned that the location had been exposed, they all felt very heavy-hearted.</p><p></p><p>The Mohist leaders had many questions about the exposure of Mirror Lake Medical Manor's location.</p><p></p><p>Snow Woman said in surprise, "In the past, we've been here so many times without ever being exposed. How come it was exposed this time?"</p><p></p><p>Gao Jianli agreed, "It's indeed very strange. This place has always been very safe. How exactly did the Shadow Guards find it?"</p><p></p><p>At this time, Iron Hammer glanced at the people of Flowing Sand intentionally or unintentionally, and said in a low voice, "Could it be that someone leaked the information? Exposing our location?"</p><p></p><p>Although Iron Hammer thought his voice was low enough, it still reached the ears of the Flowing Sand people.</p><p></p><p>Chi Lian was immediately dissatisfied: "What do you mean? Why are you looking at us Flowing Sand people? Are you suspecting that we leaked this place?"</p><p></p><p>Iron Hammer said awkwardly, "I didn't say that."</p><p></p><p>White Phoenix stared at Iron Hammer, her eyes slightly narrowed: "You didn't say it, but what you expressed between the lines clearly meant that."</p><p></p><p>The atmosphere became tense for a moment.</p><p></p><p>Previously</p><p></p><p>Here is the full English translation of the excerpt from the Chinese novel:</p><p></p><p>In the past, the leaders of the Mo family did not fully trust the people of Liusha due to past grievances. </p><p></p><p>At the time, Liusha endured it because they were in a hurry to rescue Wei Zhuang.</p><p></p><p>But now, they were once again being suspected by the Mo family for no reason, and they could not bear this grievance.</p><p></p><p>The Liusha people immediately wanted to take Wei Zhuang and Mo Yu Qilin and leave. </p><p></p><p>"Since you suspect us, then we of Liusha will take our leave."</p><p></p><p>"We will remember your kindness this time and repay you later, so we will be even."</p><p></p><p>With that said, the Liusha people were about to get up to take Wei Zhuang and Mo Yu Qilin.</p><p></p><p>Da Tiechui knew he had misspoken and immediately apologized, "Sorry everyone, it was I, Da Tiechui, who said the wrong thing. I apologize to you all here."</p><p></p><p>But the Liusha people were not so easily persuaded. </p><p></p><p>They still insisted on leaving.</p><p></p><p>If they were suspected this time, then the next time there was a problem, wouldn't they be suspected again?</p><p></p><p>No matter what, they were unwilling to stay.</p><p></p><p>Zhang Liang immediately stepped forward to stop the Liusha people.</p><p></p><p>"Everyone wait, you mustn't act impulsively based on a moment of anger, unless you want Wei Zhuang and Mo Yu Qilin to become crippled."</p><p></p><p>Hearing the names of Wei Zhuang and Mo Yu Qilin, the Liusha people stopped in their tracks.</p><p></p><p>Seeing that they still cared about this matter,</p><p></p><p>Zhang Liang softened his tone and continued, "Right now only Miss Rong can save them. Even if you want to leave, you should wait until the poison in their bodies is cleared before leaving."</p><p></p><p>Zhang Liang's words hit their weakness.</p><p></p><p>The anger from before was immediately extinguished. </p><p></p><p>The Liusha people were in a difficult position for a moment.</p><p></p><p>They could leave in a fit of anger, but what about Wei Zhuang and Mo Yu Qilin? </p><p></p><p>If the timing of their treatment was delayed and they really became crippled like Zhang Liang said, what then?</p><p></p><p>This would be something that none of the Liusha people could accept!</p><p></p><p>Seeing that the Liusha people no longer had the urgent desire to leave as before, the Mo family leader spoke up at this time.</p><p></p><p>He went against popular opinion and said, "Things have come to this point, it's better if we relocate as soon as possible. The Shadow Guards have already received the news and will catch up soon."</p><p></p><p>After the Mirror Lake Medical Manor was exposed, there was only one safe place.</p><p></p><p>That was the Mo family's Mechanical City.</p><p></p><p>The Mo family leader swept his gaze over everyone and said, "There's no time to lose. Everyone enter the Mo family's Mechanical City together, but the rules cannot be broken. Those who are not from the Mo family must have their eyes covered."</p><p></p><p>This request from the Mo family leader was not excessive; it had always been their rule.</p><p></p><p>In order to save Wei Zhuang and Mo Yu Qilin, the Liusha people finally agreed to this condition.</p><p></p><p>PS: Asking for flowers, rating tickets, comments, monthly tickets, rewards, and thanking all the handsome readers!</p><p></p><p>Feilu Novels, Fei wants you to have a good read!</p>

        <h1>Chapter 52</h1>
        <div class="content">
            <p>Ying Zheng was overjoyed to see the successful ice-making.</p><p></p><p>Could what the brat said be true?</p><p></p><p>Is it really possible to make ice using saltpeter?</p><p></p><p>Doesn't that mean the subsequent plans are entirely feasible?!</p><p></p><p>People won't have to starve anymore?</p><p></p><p>Thinking about this, the heavy burden on Ying Zheng's heart was completely lifted.</p><p></p><p>Ying Zheng couldn't help but feel fortunate that he didn't just sit there pondering, but actually tried it out.</p><p></p><p>He never thought he would really succeed!</p><p></p><p>For a moment, Ying Zheng was filled with a sense of accomplishment.</p><p></p><p>At the same time, he couldn't help but sigh in his heart.</p><p></p><p>How does this brat know everything?</p><p></p><p>He had already experienced a shock once with the papermaking technique.</p><p></p><p>But that time, he had handed the matter over to Meng Tian to handle.</p><p></p><p>So he only saw the finished product.</p><p></p><p>This time was different. This time, he personally witnessed the scene of making ice with saltpeter.</p><p></p><p>After witnessing this miraculous moment with his own eyes, his understanding of his son reached a new level.</p><p></p><p>Li Si and Zhang Heng, unlike Ying Zheng, had no mental preparation for the scene of water turning into ice.</p><p></p><p>So when they saw this scene, they were exceptionally shocked.</p><p></p><p>The two of them knelt down directly and shouted in unison, "Your Majesty's divine power! To be able to change the power of the seasons and turn water into ice!"</p><p></p><p>Ying Zheng knew that the two of them were taking the opportunity to flatter him.</p><p></p><p>However, he was not averse to it, but smiled slightly and explained, "This is not my divine power, but the saltpeter that turned the water into ice."</p><p></p><p>The two of them had fully witnessed everything, so of course they could guess that the key to water turning into ice lay in the added saltpeter.</p><p></p><p>However, when there was an opportunity to flatter, they still had to do it. If the emperor was pleased, it would be easier for his ministers.</p><p></p><p>Therefore, Li Si continued to compliment, "Even so, it was Your Majesty's wisdom, surpassing that of the heavens, that came up with this method."</p><p></p><p>"I have never seen such a strange phenomenon before. If not for Your Majesty, I'm afraid I would never have thought of this method in my lifetime. Your Majesty's wisdom truly makes me bow in admiration."</p><p></p><p>Zhang Heng also imitated and flattered, "Your Majesty's wisdom is far beyond what we ministers can match."</p><p></p><p>These words were actually half sincere.</p><p></p><p>The two of them were knowledgeable and experienced, but they had never realized that saltpeter had such an effect.</p><p></p><p>Coupled with the previous papermaking technique, the two felt even more that the emperor was unfathomable and possessed many things they didn't know about.</p><p></p><p>Unexpectedly, this flattery hit the wrong target.</p><p></p><p>Ying Zheng did not want to take credit for this matter.</p><p></p><p>He shook his head and said, "This method was not thought of by me."</p><p></p><p>Just like with the papermaking matter, he did not want to be accused of stealing Ying Chen's credit after he was born.</p><p></p><p>If it wasn't the emperor who came up with the method, then who was it?</p><p></p><p>Zhang Heng and Li Si were puzzled.</p><p></p><p>Here is the full translation of the Chinese excerpt into English:</p><p></p><p>Dazed.</p><p></p><p>But seeing that the emperor had no interest in continuing, they tactfully refrained from asking more.</p><p></p><p>Now that they had a method for making ice.</p><p></p><p>Next, they needed fishing boats and large fishing nets.</p><p></p><p>It was time for the Gongshu family to make an appearance.</p><p></p><p>Ying Zheng ordered, "Immediately summon Gongshu Chou to enter the palace and see me."</p><p></p><p>Having said that, he took Li Si and Zhang Han back to the Qilin Hall.</p><p></p><p>The emperor's order to summon Gongshu Chou was passed down layer by layer.</p><p></p><p>Soon, Gongshu Chou arrived.</p><p></p><p>"Greetings to Your Majesty, long live Your Majesty."</p><p></p><p>Gongshu Chou prostrated on the ground, his heart uneasy as to why the emperor had suddenly summoned him.</p><p></p><p>Ying Zheng spoke, "Gongshu Chou, put aside the matters at hand for now. I have an important task to entrust to you."</p><p></p><p>Gongshu Chou perked up his ears, and at this moment, he heard the emperor's majestic voice.</p><p></p><p>"I want you to put all your efforts into building a large number of fishing boats and large fishing nets, then go out to sea to catch fish. Use the ice made from saltpeter to transport the seafood to the inland, thus solving the urgent problem of food shortage."</p><p></p><p>Before Gongshu Chou could react, Li Si, who was listening on the side, was already overjoyed.</p><p></p><p>It turned out that His Majesty did not ask Zhang Han to bring saltpeter to make ice out of mere interest!</p><p></p><p>From the beginning, His Majesty had been working hard to solve the food problem!</p><p></p><p>With this, Li Si put his mind at ease.</p><p></p><p>After receiving this order, Gongshu Chou had a difficult expression.</p><p></p><p>He still had a major project in his hands. Now that His Majesty had given an order, which one should he listen to?</p><p></p><p>So, Gongshu Ban mustered up the courage to ask, "Your Majesty, what about the illusory building you asked me to construct?"</p><p></p><p>Everyone knew that His Majesty had become obsessed with seeking immortality.</p><p></p><p>And the illusory building was the key to it.</p><p></p><p>Who would have thought that when Ying Zheng heard Gongshu Chou mention the illusory building, he appeared indifferent.</p><p></p><p>With a wave of his hand, he said, "After the food problem is solved, then put all efforts into building the illusory building. But its purpose will no longer be to find the elixir of immortality, but to sail far out to sea in search of high-yielding food crops."</p><p></p><p>This stunned Gongshu Chou!</p><p></p><p>Wasn't the First Emperor seeking immortality? How did he start looking for high-yielding food crops?</p><p></p><p>He widened his eyes and confirmed, "Your Majesty wants to use the illusory building to find high-yielding food crops?"</p><p></p><p>Seeing his disbelieving look, Ying Zheng affirmed, "That's right. I will handle the Yin-Yang masters. You don't need to worry about that."</p><p></p><p>"You just do as I say. Go find crops that can produce high yields. As long as you find them, I will greatly reward you!"</p><p></p><p>Since the emperor had already made it clear, Gongshu Chou could only nod and take his leave with the order.</p><p></p><p>PS: Asking for flowers, rating tickets, comments, monthly tickets, rewards, thanks to all the handsome readers!</p><p></p><p>Three things about reading: read, collect, and reward!</p>

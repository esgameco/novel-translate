        <h1>Chapter 70</h1>
        <div class="content">
            <p>Xianyang City was also plunged into chaos at this very moment.</p><p></p><p>Countless people looked up at the sky in shock, not understanding what had happened.</p><p></p><p>"Heavens, what on earth is that thing?"</p><p></p><p>"It's a divine miracle, it must be a divine miracle sent down by the heavens."</p><p></p><p>"This old man has lived for more than seventy years and has never seen such a phenomenon."</p><p></p><p>When things cannot be explained by common sense, the common people usually understand them as divine miracles sent down from heaven.</p><p></p><p>Someone took the lead, and many people knelt down, clasped their hands together, and began to pray silently.</p><p></p><p>Praying that this divine miracle would bring them a bountiful harvest next year, allowing them to eat well and dress warmly.</p><p></p><p>Soon, the sound of people praying for blessings on the street was endless.</p><p></p><p>The residence of the eldest son of the Great Qin, separated by a wall, was also not peaceful.</p><p></p><p>Fusu stared blankly at the golden spots of light in the sky, tirelessly gathering towards the direction of the imperial palace.</p><p></p><p>He didn't know what those things were, but at this moment, his heart felt empty, and he had a vague sense of unease.</p><p></p><p>It felt like he was about to lose something.</p><p></p><p>The scholars gathered around him, chattering and discussing.</p><p></p><p>"These golden spots of light are still gathering towards the imperial palace! How long will this continue?!"</p><p></p><p>"It's so strange! Such a phenomenon is simply unheard of!"</p><p></p><p>"Anyway, it doesn't look like a natural disaster, but more like an auspicious sign."</p><p></p><p>Just as they were discussing what changes this celestial phenomenon might bring, the butler rushed in with a panicked look on his face.</p><p></p><p>"Young master! Young master! News from the palace has arrived! There are already rumors in the palace saying that this celestial phenomenon is caused by the child in Concubine Shu's womb who is about to be born!"</p><p></p><p>As soon as these words were spoken, the residence fell silent.</p><p></p><p>Fusu and the scholars were like chickens whose necks had been grabbed, their eyes wide open, unable to speak for a moment.</p><p></p><p>Such a shocking phenomenon was actually caused by the birth of Concubine Shu's child?</p><p></p><p>It's just the birth of a child, how could it cause changes in the celestial phenomenon?!</p><p></p><p>Is it really the will of heaven?!</p><p></p><p>The scholars turned pale, and with just one glance at each other, they understood each other's meaning.</p><p></p><p>One scholar took the lead and stood out, saying, "Young master, this cannot go on! We must take action!"</p><p></p><p>With someone taking the lead, the others also offered their advice one after another.</p><p></p><p>"Young master, if we don't do something soon, we'll just be waiting for our doom!"</p><p></p><p>"This child is too abnormal and cannot be allowed to live!"</p><p></p><p>Fusu closed his eyes and pondered for a moment, then opened them.</p><p></p><p>His usually gentle face became furious: "What do you mean? Do you want this young master to harm his unborn brother?"</p><p></p><p>"Is this what you call the way of the gentleman?"</p><p></p><p>Fusu's eyes swept over the scholars in front of him, the anger in his eyes not diminished in the slightest.</p><p></p><p>Sure, here's the full translation of the Chinese excerpt into English:</p><p></p><p>It doesn't seem to be fake.</p><p></p><p>The Confucian scholars were all stunned by Fusu's reaction.</p><p></p><p>They looked at Fusu in disbelief, unable to believe that the person they had been following was such a rigid and inflexible wooden head.</p><p></p><p>They knew that Fusu was somewhat pedantic in his daily life, but they never thought that he would be so inflexible to such an extent!</p><p></p><p>What time is it now?</p><p></p><p>It's not an exaggeration to say that this is a critical moment of life and death!</p><p></p><p>Is this blockhead still stubbornly adhering to those rules and regulations without being flexible?</p><p></p><p>One of the Confucian scholars couldn't help but speak up to remind him, "Young master, please forgive me for being nosy, but if this child is born safely, not to mention other things, just based on this kind of celestial phenomenon alone, it will bring him countless followers!"</p><p></p><p>"At that time, everyone will think that he is the inheritor destined by heaven! He will be a powerful competitor on your future path!"</p><p></p><p>Fusu still didn't take it seriously, and said nonchalantly, "So what? He hasn't done anything wrong. What you said are all hypothetical things. Why should we worry about things that haven't happened yet?"</p><p></p><p>The Confucian scholars still wanted to continue to persuade him, but Fusu didn't want to listen anymore.</p><p></p><p>He flicked his sleeves and said, "No need to say more. You are not allowed to do anything."</p><p></p><p>With that, he strode away.</p><p></p><p>The Confucian scholars saw Fusu leave just like that, and their mentality collapsed a bit.</p><p></p><p>What kind of thing have we taught?</p><p></p><p>We have already explained the reasoning to him clearly, but how come he can't take it in at all?</p><p></p><p>Does he really have to be a gentleman with lofty integrity but useless for the imperial throne?</p><p></p><p>But no matter how anxious they were or how much they stamped their feet, they didn't dare to act rashly in Xianyang if Fusu didn't make a move.</p><p></p><p>In another palace of the Eighteen Princes of Qin, it was also not peaceful.</p><p></p><p>Hu Hai also received the same news from his mother concubine.</p><p></p><p>Unlike Fusu, he was already so angry that he was almost going crazy!</p><p></p><p>He wished he could rush into Concubine Shu's palace immediately and kill this visibly competitive opponent in his swaddling clothes.</p><p></p><p>Unfortunately, he could only think about it himself.</p><p></p><p>His biggest helper, Zhao Gao, was still reflecting on his mistakes while facing the wall. No matter how angry he was, he had no one to use.</p><p></p><p>Without anyone to help him, what could he do?</p><p></p><p>He could only be impotently furious.</p><p></p><p>He smashed everything that could be smashed in his own residence to pieces, or severely beat his subordinates.</p><p></p><p>However, all of this was of no use.</p><p></p><p>A sense of desperate powerlessness enveloped him.</p><p></p><p>In addition, the Prime Minister's Mansion, the Meng Mansion, the Wang Mansion and other aristocratic mansions were also closely watching the direction of the Xianyang Palace, wanting to know the final result.</p><p></p><p>This child was born so extraordinary that he might change the current power structure of the Qin Dynasty in one fell swoop!</p><p></p><p>PS: Please give flowers, rating tickets, comments, monthly tickets, and rewards.

        <h1>Chapter 48</h1>
        <div class="content">
            <p>Liusha, the Mohists, Zhang Liang, and others successfully regrouped.</p><p></p><p>Seeing Weizhang unconscious, Chi Lian was extremely worried. However, it was not a good time to treat him, so they could only wait until they returned.</p><p></p><p>The others had a relaxed expression, as at least their operation was successful this time.</p><p></p><p>Shi Ya Prison was known as the last fortress to defend against the enemy, a place where escape was absolutely impossible.</p><p></p><p>But they, with just this many people, had achieved the feat of rescuing someone from Shi Ya Prison!</p><p></p><p>It was probably the first time in history!</p><p></p><p>Thinking of this, everyone was overjoyed, feeling that they had created a new history.</p><p></p><p>Zhang Liang looked at the joyful faces of everyone, but felt a hint of unease in his heart.</p><p></p><p>He originally thought that the poison on Weizhang's body was fatal and could take someone's life when it acted up.</p><p></p><p>But now it seems that although Weizhang was poisoned, it was not a fatal poison.</p><p></p><p>It had been quite some time since Weizhang activated his internal energy, causing the poison to take effect.</p><p></p><p>Now, apart from being unconscious, Weizhang had no other symptoms. The rest would need to be carefully examined after returning to know for sure.</p><p></p><p>In this case, Zhang Liang couldn't understand.</p><p></p><p>Since the other party sent Luowang's people to guard Shi Ya Prison, hoping to use these three people in Shi Ya Prison to lure them out.</p><p></p><p>And they had poisoned Weizhang and the others.</p><p></p><p>These signs indicated that the other party had long thought of the possibility of someone breaking into the prison.</p><p></p><p>If so, why not directly use a poison that would put them to death?</p><p></p><p>Anyway, Gai Nie, Weizhang and the others had already lured the others to come to the prison break, and had no more value.</p><p></p><p>Or could it be that what they were poisoned with was actually a slow-acting poison, just that they couldn't see it now?</p><p></p><p>Another doubtful point was that their escape was too smooth.</p><p></p><p>Luowang had already been defeated by them, so after shaking off Yan Ri and Jing Ni, there were basically no pursuers.</p><p></p><p>Why didn't the other party send out Zhang Han and the Yin-Yang family experts to intercept them in the end?</p><p></p><p>Were they very confident, thinking that just sending out Luowang was enough to complete the task of intercepting them?</p><p></p><p>Or were they relatively lucky and just happened not to encounter any pursuers?</p><p></p><p>In any case, it seemed to be their victory at the moment, but in fact the situation was still not optimistic for them.</p><p></p><p>Next, they not only needed to be wary of fleeing soldiers, but also take care of the poisoned Weizhang, and the others were also injured to varying degrees...</p><p></p><p>Thinking of this, Zhang Liang's face couldn't help but become solemn.</p><p></p><p>The Mohist giant noticed Zhang Liang's expression and asked, "What's wrong? Master Zhang Liang seems to have something on his mind?"</p><p></p><p>Zhang Liang shook his head slightly and said, "It's nothing. I came out this time without telling the Confucians, so it's not good to ask the Confucians for help. We need to quickly find someone else to detoxify them as soon as possible."</p><p></p><p>Dao Zhi said nonchalantly, "Don't worry, no matter what poison it is, it's nothing in front of Miss Rong."</p><p></p><p>Zhang Liang also</p><p></p><p>Here is the full English translation of the Chinese novel excerpt:</p><p></p><p>Having heard of the great reputation of the Medical Immortal, he was certain of her medical skills. He nodded and said, "I hope so."</p><p></p><p>On the other side at the Luo Wang garrison:</p><p></p><p>Yan Ri, Jing Ni, Zhen Gang and others brought back the corpses of Luan Shen and Wang Liang. </p><p></p><p>Seeing the Six Sword Slaves severely injured, Zhao Gao was instantly furious!</p><p></p><p>He had already repeatedly warned them that failure was not an option for this mission. </p><p></p><p>Why did it still fail!</p><p></p><p>And it ended in such a tragic way!</p><p></p><p>Zhao Gao looked at Yan Ri coldly and said, "What exactly happened?"</p><p></p><p>Yan Ri lowered his head and began to recount the events from beginning to end.</p><p></p><p>"Liu Sha and the Mo Jia secretly formed an alliance. The few people from Liu Sha lured away me and Jing Ni, while the Mo Jia took the opportunity to attack the Six Sword Slaves, causing Zhang Liang and the others to break into the Shi Ya Prison and rescue the people."</p><p></p><p>Listening to his report, Zhao Gao became more and more enraged. The veins on his neck bulged and killing intent emanated from his body. </p><p></p><p>Sensing the thick murderous aura, Yan Ri couldn't help but justify himself.</p><p></p><p>"Although this time we indeed underestimated Liu Sha and didn't expect them to ally with Mo Jia, catching us off guard."</p><p></p><p>"But I thought about it on the way back. This time, the mission His Majesty arranged for us to guard Shi Ya Prison was a bit strange to begin with!"</p><p></p><p>Zhao Gao felt a chill in his heart. He looked at Yan Ri with eyes full of murderous intent and said, "Strange? What do you mean? Could it be that His Majesty deliberately tried to harm us?!"</p><p></p><p>His volume suddenly rose as he said the last sentence.</p><p></p><p>Yan Ri lowered his head, avoiding Zhao Gao's gaze. "I wouldn't dare. I was just speaking my mind."</p><p></p><p>Yan Ri never says useless things. </p><p></p><p>Since he said it, it shows he indeed harbors suspicions in his heart.</p><p></p><p>Zhao Gao narrowed his eyes and looked at Jing Ni. "What do you think? Was this mission strange?"</p><p></p><p>Jing Ni recalled her solo visit to Consort Shu's palace before. </p><p></p><p>At that time, Ying Zheng did not discover her presence at first. Later, it seemed like he received a tip from someone and suddenly ordered a search of the surroundings.</p><p></p><p>Connecting this and thinking back to this mission where the Shadow Guards were suddenly withdrawn and they, the Luo Wang, were sent to carry it out instead.</p><p></p><p>Jing Ni hesitated for a moment and said, "His Majesty's recent actions are indeed a bit strange and somewhat different from his previous style."</p><p></p><p>"I feel these things don't seem to be His Majesty's own ideas, but more like someone is hidden behind His Majesty making the decisions."</p><p></p><p>Hearing Jing Ni's words, Zhao Gao fell into deep thought for a while.</p><p></p><p>If it was just Yan Ri saying this, so be it. But Jing Ni also thinks this way?</p><p></p><p>Zhao Gao waved his hand, dismissing Yan Ri, Jing Ni and the others. He needed to think carefully.</p>

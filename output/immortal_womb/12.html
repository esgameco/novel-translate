        <h1>Chapter 12</h1>
        <div class="content">
            <p>In the residence of Meng Tian.</p><p></p><p>Meng Tian was practicing his spear techniques for breaking formations. Each thrust was filled with murderous intent, piercing the air and emitting a sharp whistling sound.</p><p></p><p>At this moment, the butler came running to report.</p><p></p><p>"General! General! His Majesty, His Majesty has arrived!"</p><p></p><p>Meng Tian wiped the sweat from his face. For a moment, he doubted if he had heard correctly.</p><p></p><p>The Emperor had actually left the palace and personally came to his residence?</p><p></p><p>This wasn't right. If the Emperor had any matters, he would have directly summoned him to the palace.</p><p></p><p>For him to personally come here, could it be that some major event had occurred, urgently requiring his counsel?</p><p></p><p>He tried to recall but couldn't find any clues in his mind.</p><p></p><p>Meng Tian's heart became uneasy.</p><p></p><p>He put down the weapon in his hand and immediately followed the butler to the entrance to welcome the Emperor.</p><p></p><p>But different from what he had imagined, the Emperor's expression was not one of tension or any other negative emotion.</p><p></p><p>Instead, it was... excitement?</p><p></p><p>Ying Zheng saw the large crowd of people from the Meng household bowing to him, and he directly ordered them to rise.</p><p></p><p>Then, he hurriedly walked straight into Meng Tian's residence.</p><p></p><p>Meng Tian was puzzled and could only follow behind the First Emperor as they entered.</p><p></p><p>They entered Meng Tian's study inside the residence.</p><p></p><p>Meng Tian cautiously asked, "May I know if Your Majesty has come today because some urgent matter has occurred?"</p><p></p><p>Ying Zheng saw Meng Tian's slightly nervous expression and suddenly found it amusing.</p><p></p><p>He waved his hand and said, "You don't need to be nervous. I do have a matter to discuss with you, but it's not a bad thing."</p><p></p><p>Hearing the First Emperor's golden words that it wasn't a bad thing, Meng Tian finally breathed a sigh of relief.</p><p></p><p>Although the Meng family acted with a clear conscience, for the Emperor to personally come, it was enough to indicate that this matter was very important.</p><p></p><p>Ying Zheng looked at Meng Tian's attire, with his clothes tightly tied, giving a capable appearance.</p><p></p><p>One look and it was clear that before his arrival, Meng Tian had been practicing martial arts.</p><p></p><p>To think that such a great general would be engaged in the delicate work of improving writing brushes.</p><p></p><p>So, Ying Zheng asked half-jokingly, "Have you finished improving your writing brushes?"</p><p></p><p>Meng Tian, upon hearing this, couldn't hide the surprise in his eyes. He cupped his hands and said, "In the past, I often had to handle military affairs on carriages or even horseback, and the current writing brushes are not very convenient for me to use."</p><p></p><p>"So I thought about whether I could improve them to allow people to write more conveniently."</p><p></p><p>"But I have never mentioned this matter to anyone. How did Your Majesty come to know of it?"</p><p></p><p>Ying Zheng smiled slightly and said mysteriously, "I naturally have my ways. You don't need to worry about it."</p><p></p><p>Hearing from the Emperor's tone that he not only did not reprimand him for improving the writing brushes, but even had a hint of appreciation, Meng Tian completely put his heart at ease.</p><p></p><p>At this time, Ying Zheng finally brought up the purpose of his visit.</p><p></p><p>Here is the full translation of the Chinese excerpt into English:</p><p></p><p>"I have come this time to entrust you with a good task. If you can accomplish this, I will credit you with a meritorious service," said Ying Zheng.</p><p></p><p>Before even mentioning the task, he brought up the topic of merit. Meng Tian was very curious.</p><p></p><p>"May I ask, Your Majesty, what is this task? I will certainly do my utmost to fulfill it!" Meng Tian replied.</p><p></p><p>Ying Zheng picked up a bamboo slip from the table and said, "Meng Tian, if I told you that there is a material in the world called paper, which can be produced without the time and effort required for bamboo slips, and is also very lightweight and easy to write on, what would you think?"</p><p></p><p>Upon hearing Ying Zheng's words, Meng Tian was stunned for a moment.</p><p></p><p>"Your Majesty, is there really such a wonderful material in the world? Wouldn't it be as precious as gold?" Meng Tian asked.</p><p></p><p>Ying Zheng shook his head and said, "On the contrary, paper is not that precious. In fact, it is made from the most humble materials, and the cost is probably less than one-tenth of that of bamboo slips."</p><p></p><p>With that, Ying Zheng explained the steps and materials for papermaking to him.</p><p></p><p>"Tree bark, old fishing nets, rags, and hemp are boiled and then pounded into a pulp. The pulp is then scooped out using a bamboo screen to form thin sheets, which are dried in the sun," Ying Zheng explained.</p><p></p><p>When Meng Tian heard how low the cost of papermaking was, he immediately became excited.</p><p></p><p>"If what Your Majesty says is true, this so-called 'paper' will surely spread rapidly!" Meng Tian exclaimed.</p><p></p><p>Once paper, which makes writing easy, becomes widely available, the impact would be immense!</p><p></p><p>Meng Tian's eyes sparkled as he thought of many possibilities.</p><p></p><p>"Your Majesty, if we can successfully manufacture paper, the significance will be immeasurable! Not to mention the transmission of battle reports on the battlefield, which will become many times more convenient!" Meng Tian said.</p><p></p><p>"And let's not even talk about the Confucian scholars. If they can get their hands on this thing called 'paper,' they will probably be overjoyed!" Meng Tian added.</p><p></p><p>Not only the Confucian scholars but probably all the people in the world who love to read books would be ecstatic!</p><p></p><p>Meng Tian dared to assert that the emergence of this "paper" would greatly change the current world!</p><p></p><p>Undoubtedly, this would be a great achievement that would go down in history!</p><p></p><p>And His Majesty the Emperor had actually entrusted this task to him, Meng Tian!</p><p></p><p>What a great trust and favor this was!</p><p></p><p>Thinking of this, Meng Tian couldn't help but feel moved.</p><p></p><p>But there was also a sense of excitement and eagerness that stirred his emotions.</p><p></p><p>He knelt on one knee, clasped his hands in salute, and vowed, "Since Your Majesty has placed such trust in me, I will certainly not let you down! I will definitely complete the task!"</p><p></p><p>Meng Tian's serious attitude showed that entrusting him with the task was the right choice.</p><p></p><p>Ying Zheng nodded with satisfaction.</p><p></p><p>PS: 10 updates every day.

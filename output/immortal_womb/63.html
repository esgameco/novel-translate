        <h1>Chapter 63</h1>
        <div class="content">
            <p>Here is the full translation from Chinese to English:</p><p></p><p>At this time, at Zhao Gao's mansion on the other side, the main gate was still tightly closed, refusing all visitors.</p><p></p><p>Yan Ri, who had gone to investigate, returned and immediately reported to Zhao Gao: "The Yin-Yang masters indeed made a move. Although they were very careful to hide their tracks, they still couldn't escape our eyes."</p><p></p><p>"It should have been the Great Siming and Lesser Siming who were sent, but both of them were injured and have already escaped from the palace."</p><p></p><p>Zhao Gao narrowed his eyes, revealing a dangerous look.</p><p></p><p>"This at least proves one thing - there is indeed someone with extremely strong power hidden in the rear palace. Even the Great Siming and Lesser Siming are no match for them, which shows how powerful this person is."</p><p></p><p>To be able to injure these two at the same time, this strength was something they had to take seriously.</p><p></p><p>Yan Ri said with a bitter smile: "In addition to this, there is also a piece of bad news."</p><p></p><p>Zhao Gao frowned, his mood turning sour again: "What bad news?"</p><p></p><p>Right now, apart from gathering information, almost everyone in the Luo Web was recovering from injuries. How could there still be bad news?</p><p></p><p>Zhao Gao couldn't think of what bad news there could be.</p><p></p><p>Bringing this up, Yan Ri also felt it was a thorny issue: "It's about the assassins we sent out earlier to gather information. Tonight, because of those two from the Yin-Yang family, their tracks were likely exposed."</p><p></p><p>Hearing this, Zhao Gao was shocked: "What? They were discovered?! What exactly happened?!"</p><p></p><p>Yan Ri explained: "When the Great Siming and Lesser Siming escaped tonight, who knows if it was intentional or unintentional, they actually fled in the direction of where our assassins were!"</p><p></p><p>"There were many Shadow Guards in pursuit, so naturally our assassins couldn't hide anymore, and were then exposed."</p><p></p><p>Upon hearing this, Zhao Gao's face instantly turned pale as a sheet.</p><p></p><p>Yan Ri noticed the change in Zhao Gao's complexion, but hadn't yet realized how big of an impact this matter would bring.</p><p></p><p>He frowned: "Is the situation very serious? Our people escaped at that time and weren't caught."</p><p></p><p>In Yan Ri's view, as long as they weren't caught red-handed, there was still room to maneuver.</p><p></p><p>Moreover, this time they were just gathering information. His Majesty might focus more on the Yin-Yang side and not pay attention to the Luo Web's spying.</p><p></p><p>Seeing Yan Ri's obtuseness, Zhao Gao couldn't help but become furious.</p><p></p><p>"You said it yourself, the Yin-Yang people hid their tracks. In this situation, if His Majesty learns that Luo Web assassins appeared near the rear palace, what do you think he will assume?!"</p><p></p><p>His Majesty will undoubtedly believe, without question, that the intruder who broke into the rear palace was sent by their Luo Web!</p><p></p><p>Even if their Luo Web assassins did nothing and were just gathering some information!</p><p></p><p>Yan Ri understood the severity of the situation and was shocked: "Then what should we do?!"</p><p></p><p>This was an unsolvable dilemma.</p><p></p><p>They couldn't explain to His Majesty that the Luo Web went to the rear palace just to...</p><p></p><p>Here is the full translation of the Chinese excerpt into English:</p><p></p><p>Gong's purpose was only to go and investigate the news.</p><p></p><p>Peeking into the imperial harem is also a serious crime of disrespect!</p><p></p><p>Moreover, His Majesty would not listen to their explanations at all!</p><p></p><p>He had already determined that Luo Wang was the murderer, so no matter what Luo Wang said, it would be considered a sophistry.</p><p></p><p>This huge and heavy black pot, their Luo Wang family would bear it for the Yin-Yang family!</p><p></p><p>Thinking of this, Zhao Gao closed his eyes in pain and slumped into a chair.</p><p></p><p>"Prepare a backup plan. Anyway, His Majesty has long since stopped trusting us. So let's hide and lie low for now, and wait for a new opportunity."</p><p></p><p>Yan Ri asked in puzzlement, "What new opportunity?"</p><p></p><p>Zhao Gao opened his eyes and said coldly, "Naturally, it's Hu Hai."</p><p></p><p>As long as Hu Hai ascended to the throne, their Luo Wang family would have a chance to rise again.</p><p></p><p>For now, this was the only option.</p><p></p><p>Yan Ri agreed with Zhao Gao's view.</p><p></p><p>He took the order and went to notify the members of Luo Wang.</p><p></p><p>That night, there was a lot of commotion in the imperial harem.</p><p></p><p>The Shadow Guards were busy searching for suspicious personnel inside, as well as other clues about the assassin.</p><p></p><p>Except for insiders like Zhao Gao, many people only had a partial understanding of the matter and were not clear about what exactly had happened.</p><p></p><p>In the Qin Left Prime Minister's residence.</p><p></p><p>Before dawn, Li Si received news that an assassin had appeared in the imperial harem, and it was said that the assassin had attacked Shu Fei's palace.</p><p></p><p>Upon hearing this news, Li Si immediately became alert.</p><p></p><p>He read the news over and over again, and his face became solemn.</p><p></p><p>Who in the entire Xianyang didn't know how much His Majesty valued Shu Fei?</p><p></p><p>Not only did he repeatedly promote her rank, but he even moved political affairs to Shu Fei's palace to handle them.</p><p></p><p>Li Si had personally witnessed that His Majesty did not avoid Shu Fei's presence when dealing with political affairs.</p><p></p><p>It seemed that he had already reached a point where he could not bear to part with Shu Fei.</p><p></p><p>Moreover, His Majesty had dispatched most of the Shadow Guards to secretly protect Shu Fei.</p><p></p><p>Even the patrols of the imperial guards in the harem had increased significantly compared to the past.</p><p></p><p>The defense was so strict, obviously out of concern for assassins attacking the imperial harem.</p><p></p><p>If something happened to Shu Fei, the Son of Heaven would be furious, and the entire Xianyang would probably have a hard time!</p><p></p><p>Thinking of this, Li Si lost all sleepiness.</p><p></p><p>He was eager to know how the situation was progressing.</p><p></p><p>Especially Shu Fei, he didn't know if she was injured or not.</p><p></p><p>If Shu Fei was already injured, then he had to prepare to face His Majesty's thunderous wrath.</p><p></p><p>Thinking of this, Li Si ordered the housekeeper, "The situation in the palace must be closely watched! As soon as there is news, report to me immediately!"</p><p></p><p>The housekeeper hurriedly agreed and arranged for personnel to go.</p><p></p><p>PS: Asking for flowers, rating tickets, comments, monthly tickets, rewards, thanks to all the handsome readers!</p><p></p><p>Three things about reading: read, collect, and reward!</p>

        <h1>Chapter 60</h1>
        <div class="content">
            <p>No matter how shocked Shao Siming was in her heart, her hands didn't stop for a bit.</p><p></p><p>She exerted all her strength to perform the Wanye Feihua technique.</p><p></p><p>The gathered leaves formed huge vines, rolling towards Ying Chen.</p><p></p><p>Those vast and overwhelming huge vines seemed to possess the power to destroy anything.</p><p></p><p>Ying Chen's expression remained unchanged as he directly slashed his sword towards the huge vines that covered the sky.</p><p></p><p>The abundant imperial energy within his body poured out with this slash, forming a vast and fierce golden sword qi.</p><p></p><p>The instant that golden sword qi made contact with the huge vines formed by the Wanye Feihua technique, those vines were cut off cleanly!</p><p></p><p>Fragile and unable to withstand a single blow!</p><p></p><p>After severing the vines, the momentum of the golden sword qi did not diminish and went straight for Shao Siming!</p><p></p><p>Shao Siming had no time to react at all.</p><p></p><p>Before she could retreat, the sword qi had already reached in front of her, striking her body!</p><p></p><p>The impact force of this sword qi was too powerful, and Shao Siming was sent flying!</p><p></p><p>Shao Siming struggled to control her body, flying several meters through the air before stopping.</p><p></p><p>Needless to say, having suffered this blow, Shao Siming was severely injured and fell unconscious.</p><p></p><p>Just then, there was movement in the distance.</p><p></p><p>It was the palace guards. They had noticed the sounds coming from this direction, discovered the abnormality, and were rushing over.</p><p></p><p>"What's that sound over there?"</p><p></p><p>"It's over here! Come this way!"</p><p></p><p>"Quick! Go and see!"</p><p></p><p>After all, the commotion from the fight just now was not small.</p><p></p><p>It was simply impossible not to attract people's attention.</p><p></p><p>Ying Chen was not flustered either. He looked at the two women lying unconscious on the ground.</p><p></p><p>Pondering how to deal with them.</p><p></p><p>Almost instantly, he made a judgment.</p><p></p><p>He still had use for these two and didn't want to hand them over just like that.</p><p></p><p>With this thought, Ying Chen immediately took the two women to a secluded palace.</p><p></p><p>The concubine who lived here had long since died, so this place was a veritable abandoned palace, and there was no need to worry about anyone coming.</p><p></p><p>Ying Chen threw the two unconscious women on the ground.</p><p></p><p>Then he looked at his own hands, deep in thought.</p><p></p><p>When his divine soul left his body and came into contact with others, he always had a feeling.</p><p></p><p>It seemed he could manipulate other people's divine souls.</p><p></p><p>Ying Chen believed in his intuition and immediately prepared to give it a try.</p><p></p><p>Ying Chen's hands lightly covered Da Siming's head.</p><p></p><p>With a slight exertion of force, he successfully extracted Da Siming's divine soul.</p><p></p><p>Compared to him, Da Siming's divine soul could be said to be dim and lightless.</p><p></p><p>Ying Chen held Da Siming's divine soul in his hand, pondering how to utilize this skill of his.</p><p></p><p>Soon, he discovered that his ability was not limited to just extracting other people's divine souls.</p><p></p><p>As long as he wanted, he could perform even more manipulations on Da Siming's divine soul.</p><p></p><p>Here is the English translation of the Chinese novel excerpt:</p><p></p><p>For example, modifying memories, changing one's cognition, and so on. </p><p></p><p>In this way, there are many possibilities to play with.</p><p></p><p>Ying Chen began to modify Da Si Ming's cognition.</p><p></p><p>He shaped himself into Da Si Ming's master, while Da Si Ming was his loyal and devoted maid who would never betray him.</p><p></p><p>The cognition he created would be deeply imprinted on Da Si Ming's mind like a steel seal. </p><p></p><p>No matter what happened, her cognition of being Ying Chen's maid would never be doubted or changed.</p><p></p><p>Ying Chen was very satisfied with his masterpiece.</p><p></p><p>He stuffed Da Si Ming's soul back in.</p><p></p><p>Next was the time to wake up Da Si Ming and check the results after his modification.</p><p></p><p>Da Si Ming's eyes slowly opened, and sure enough, the previous unruliness was gone.</p><p></p><p>The beautiful face became extremely submissive the moment she saw Ying Chen.</p><p></p><p>She got up, knelt down to Ying Chen and said, "Greetings to the master."</p><p></p><p>Seeing his work after the modification, Ying Chen nodded with great satisfaction.</p><p></p><p>At this time, Ying Chen suddenly remembered Dong Huang Tai Yi, the person hiding behind the Yin-Yang family.</p><p></p><p>Ying Chen looked at Da Si Ming and asked, "Do you know the true identity of Dong Huang Tai Yi?"</p><p></p><p>In the original work before he crossed over, Dong Huang Tai Yi's true identity was not revealed, which made him a little curious.</p><p></p><p>Da Si Ming shook her head, indicating that she did not know the answer to this question.</p><p></p><p>Ying Chen was not surprised by this answer. </p><p></p><p>Dong Huang Tai Yi also hid his face within the Yin-Yang family, always wearing a mask in front of people, with a black robe covering his body.</p><p></p><p>With Da Si Ming's status, it was normal for her not to see his true face.</p><p></p><p>Ying Chen was not in a hurry, pondering how to arrange these two next.</p><p></p><p>Just then, Shao Si Ming, who had fainted earlier, slowly opened her eyes and woke up.</p><p></p><p>As soon as she regained consciousness, what caught her eyes was Ying Chen, and Da Si Ming kneeling in front of Ying Chen.</p><p></p><p>This scene was too shocking, so much so that Shao Si Ming, who witnessed it, did not understand the current situation at all.</p><p></p><p>Shao Si Ming's brain quickly crashed, and she almost thought she was seeing an illusion!</p><p></p><p>What, what is this situation? </p><p></p><p>Why would Da Si Ming kneel in front of Ying Chen?</p><p></p><p>Aren't they enemies? </p><p></p><p>How come it looks more like a pair of master and servant?</p><p></p><p>Did Da Si Ming defect? Is she going to betray the Yin-Yang family?</p><p></p><p>Or is she dreaming?</p><p></p><p>Ying Chen beside her noticed that Shao Si Ming was awake and looked at her.</p><p></p><p>"You're awake?"</p><p></p><p>Ying Chen couldn't help but smile.</p><p></p><p>Shao Si Ming saw that Ying Chen noticed her, and she was startled.</p><p></p><p>She instinctively wanted to escape, but when she looked at Da Si Ming, she saw that the other party's expression was calm, as if no matter what Ying Chen did to her, it was right.</p>

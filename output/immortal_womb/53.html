        <h1>Chapter 53</h1>
        <div class="content">
            <p>Here is the full translation of the excerpt from Chinese to English:</p><p></p><p>Li Si was overjoyed upon hearing that Ying Zheng would no longer seek the elixir of immortality.</p><p></p><p>"Your Majesty is wise! Making such a great sacrifice for the people of the world, truly a benevolent ruler!"</p><p></p><p>Li Si was genuinely moved this time. His Majesty was actually willing to let go of his long-cherished wish for immortality and put the people's affairs first!</p><p></p><p>His Majesty had really changed!</p><p></p><p>Zhang Heng also secretly breathed a sigh of relief.</p><p></p><p>In fact, they all felt that the matter of the immortality elixir was unreliable.</p><p></p><p>Throughout history, who had truly achieved immortality?</p><p></p><p>But the First Emperor was so enthusiastic and determined to find the elixir of immortality that they didn't have the courage to oppose him.</p><p></p><p>Ying Zheng was very pleased to hear Li Si's praise.</p><p></p><p>In any case, he already had his son's method of immortality, so he didn't care about mirages at all.</p><p></p><p>But he was a qualified emperor and would not become complacent after hearing a little praise from his ministers. There were still a lot of things waiting for him to arrange.</p><p></p><p>"Li Si, go and arrange the manpower for catching fish."</p><p></p><p>Li Si happily agreed.</p><p></p><p>The worrying issue of food shortage had a solution, and his mood had improved a lot.</p><p></p><p>Li Si withdrew with light steps, eager to go back and arrange the task the First Emperor had given him.</p><p></p><p>But after leaving the Xianyang Palace, his footsteps suddenly stopped.</p><p></p><p>He suddenly felt that something was wrong.</p><p></p><p>He sorted out today's events from the beginning and found them increasingly strange.</p><p></p><p>What exactly happened today?</p><p></p><p>Since His Majesty had a countermeasure to the food emergency from the beginning, why did he take him to the Shu Concubine's palace halfway through?!</p><p></p><p>Moreover, how could His Majesty know the method of making ice with saltpeter?</p><p></p><p>He didn't admit that he invented it himself, but he also didn't say who invented it.</p><p></p><p>Moreover, His Majesty could only come into contact with these ministers in the palace.</p><p></p><p>Li Si understood his colleagues and did not believe that they had presented the method of making ice with saltpeter.</p><p></p><p>Thinking of this, Li Si also thought of the recent events.</p><p></p><p>Gai Nie was inexplicably intercepted, papermaking appeared out of nowhere, and today the method of making ice with saltpeter suddenly appeared.</p><p></p><p>These events did not seem like His Majesty's style at all.</p><p></p><p>How did it feel like there was another person behind His Majesty?</p><p></p><p>Li Si was startled by his own guess.</p><p></p><p>Then he shook his head and denied his speculation.</p><p></p><p>Another person? How could that be possible?</p><p></p><p>Today he was by His Majesty's side without leaving a step. His Majesty clearly had not been in contact with anyone except these few people.</p><p></p><p>He was really overthinking.</p><p></p><p>Li Si laughed at himself for being oversensitive and left.</p><p></p><p>On the other side, the Yin-Yang family quickly received the news.</p><p></p><p>After receiving the news, Moon God reported to Dong Huang Tai Yi, "Lord Dong Huang, His Majesty has summoned Gong Shu Chou to suspend the construction of</p><p></p><p>Here is the English translation of the Chinese novel excerpt:</p><p></p><p>"The mirage ship."</p><p></p><p>"And His Majesty declared that even if the mirage ship is successfully built in the future, it will no longer be used to search for the elixir of immortality, but to sail far across the sea in search of high-yielding crops."</p><p></p><p>When this news came out, the Yin-Yang masters were caught off guard and stunned for a moment. </p><p></p><p>The air fell into silence for a while.</p><p></p><p>Soon, Xu Fu, the Lord of Clouds, was the first to react. He anxiously said: "What? Is His Majesty giving up on immortality? If so, how can I still concoct the elixir of immortality?"</p><p></p><p>Seeing Xu Fu's anxious look, Xinghun sneered secretly. </p><p></p><p>He never believed there was any elixir of immortality.</p><p></p><p>If there really was such a good thing, Xu Fu would have taken it himself. How could he offer it up?</p><p></p><p>When the Eastern Emperor Taiyi heard this news, he was shocked. </p><p></p><p>Even the black robe could not hide his body shaking!</p><p></p><p>Building the mirage ship to concoct the elixir of immortality for Ying Zheng was an important part of their plan!</p><p></p><p>How could there be a mistake at this time?!</p><p></p><p>The Eastern Emperor Taiyi asked the Moon Goddess, "What exactly is going on?! What happened? Why did Ying Zheng undergo such a big change?"</p><p></p><p>The Moon Goddess herself was also in shock from the news. She shook her head and said, "This subordinate does not know. Currently I only know that His Majesty went to Consort Shu's palace, and later at the pond side with Zhang Han, Li Si and others, came up with some method of making ice with saltpeter. Then he announced to change the purpose of the mirage ship."</p><p></p><p>How did this method of making ice with saltpeter suddenly pop up? </p><p></p><p>With this, why change the purpose of the mirage ship?!</p><p></p><p>Could it be that his many years of planning will be defeated by Ying Zheng's momentary whim?!</p><p></p><p>Then what do his many years of hard work count for?</p><p></p><p>He does not accept it!</p><p></p><p>The Eastern Emperor Taiyi was furious!</p><p></p><p>The anger in his heart kept surging, spreading all the way to his brain, burning his reason.</p><p></p><p>It had been a long time since he felt this kind of uncontrolled feeling.</p><p></p><p>The other Yin-Yang masters sensed the Eastern Emperor Taiyi's anger and lowered their heads one after another in fear and trepidation. </p><p></p><p>The Eastern Emperor has always had everything under control, and has never been so angry!</p><p></p><p>At this time, the Eastern Emperor Taiyi suddenly realized something was wrong!</p><p></p><p>This is not Ying Zheng's style!</p><p></p><p>All these years, he has been busy fighting wars or handling political affairs. How could he know any method of making ice with saltpeter? </p><p></p><p>If he really knew, why didn't he use it before?</p><p></p><p>There must be a mastermind behind Ying Zheng!</p><p></p><p>It must be that mastermind who gave Ying Zheng the plan!</p><p></p><p>It was also that person who made Ying Zheng give up the method of immortality, and instead wanted to use the mirage ship for his own purposes.</p><p></p><p>Investigate! We must find out who the other party is!</p><p></p><p>Daring to snatch the mirage ship from our Yin-Yang family, I will definitely make him regret coming into this world!</p>

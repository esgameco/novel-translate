        <h1>Chapter 15</h1>
        <div class="content">
            <p>In the Confucian Sage's Manor.</p><p></p><p>Fu Nian, Yan Lu, and Zhang Liang were discussing Gai Nie's situation.</p><p></p><p>The reason and consequences of Gai Nie's capture were known to all officials and had already spread among the people.</p><p></p><p>Gai Nie was the world's greatest sword saint and definitely not an easy opponent to deal with.</p><p></p><p>Yet even he was captured, which was enough to show the empire's formidable strength.</p><p></p><p>The empire released this news to intimidate those internal forces that intended to rebel against Qin.</p><p></p><p>From the current effect, it was quite remarkable.</p><p></p><p>Many people had given up their restless desire to resist the empire.</p><p></p><p>The three Confucians believed that behind Gai Nie's capture, there must be the empire's trump card.</p><p></p><p>However, no matter how much they guessed, without knowing the inside information, it was a waste of effort.</p><p></p><p>The only regret was that after Gai Nie's capture, they lost a great general in their plan to oppose Qin.</p><p></p><p>While they were sighing, the Confucian scholars' pigeon mail flew across mountains and rivers and entered the Confucian Sage's Manor.</p><p></p><p>When they opened the pigeon mail from the Xianyang Confucian scholars and touched the attached paper.</p><p></p><p>In an instant, the three were shocked and speechless.</p><p></p><p>Is this paper?</p><p></p><p>It can be used for writing and replace bamboo slips?!</p><p></p><p>Amazing!</p><p></p><p>Not only is it so lightweight, but the raw materials mentioned in the letter are also so simple and cheap!</p><p></p><p>If it can really be promoted, who knows how many people will learn to read and write because of it.</p><p></p><p>Their Confucian thoughts will flourish with this!</p><p></p><p>What's even more exciting is that Ying Zheng actually made the detailed papermaking process public!</p><p></p><p>Fu Nian and Yan Lu were overjoyed.</p><p></p><p>"Although this Ying Zheng massacred the six states, this matter can be considered a great contribution for generations to come."</p><p></p><p>"Yes, with this, even the poor can make their own paper and use it themselves or sell it to others, which is extremely beneficial."</p><p></p><p>Hearing the two praise Ying Zheng, Zhang Liang's face looked a bit unsightly.</p><p></p><p>His family had been the prime minister of the Han state for five generations. If it weren't for Ying Zheng, why would he have to seek refuge with the Confucians to find an opportunity to oppose Qin?</p><p></p><p>Now, the Confucians were full of praise for Ying Zheng, where did that leave him?</p><p></p><p>Fu Nian didn't think about these things. He was eager to tell Xunzi, who was in seclusion in the back mountain, about this good news.</p><p></p><p>Zhang Liang left with the excuse of feeling unwell.</p><p></p><p>He was going to visit the Mohists.</p><p></p><p>Yan Lu looked at Zhang Liang's departing figure and shook his head slightly.</p><p></p><p>On the other side, in the Flowing Sand Valley.</p><p></p><p>Chi Lian, dressed in fiery red, looked solemn as she walked towards Wei Zhuang and said, "Zhuang, Gai Nie has been captured by the Qin state and thrown into the Devouring Fang Prison."</p><p></p><p>Wei Zhuang's usually calm face suddenly turned pale.</p><p></p><p>"Big Brother Gai was captured?!"</p><p></p><p>His big brother Gai Nie was a sword saint, how could he be defeated by the people of Qin?</p><p></p><p>He found it hard to believe.</p><p></p><p>Currently in</p><p></p><p>Here is the full English translation of the excerpt from the Chinese novel:</p><p></p><p>In his view, besides himself, there was no one who could fight his senior brother one-on-one!</p><p></p><p>Who on earth was it? Who got ahead of him and defeated his senior brother?</p><p></p><p>Chi Lian knew Weizhang's obsession. She triple-checked this news and it was indeed true. </p><p></p><p>Weizhang could not accept it.</p><p></p><p>Even if Gai Nie was to die, he had to die under his sword!</p><p></p><p>Not die in Shi Ya Prison!</p><p></p><p>Except for himself, no one in the world was qualified to take his life!</p><p></p><p>Weizhang's eyes turned cold. He stood up, ready to lead people to take action.</p><p></p><p>At this time, an uninvited guest arrived. </p><p></p><p>It was Yan Ri, the most mysterious assassin sent by Zhao Gao's Luo Wang organization.</p><p></p><p>He appeared in the attire of an imperial iron armor soldier.</p><p></p><p>Not only did he arrive at Flowing Sand Valley without anyone noticing, but as soon as he arrived, he said, "I want to make a deal with Flowing Sand."</p><p></p><p>Chi Lian stood beside Weizhang, looking at him with vigilance.</p><p></p><p>Weizhang also had little affection for such people who hid their heads and exposed their tails, unwilling to show their true faces.</p><p></p><p>He said coldly, "If you want to talk about my senior brother being captured, then you can get lost. I already know about this matter."</p><p></p><p>Yan Ri chuckled, "It seems that although Flowing Sand is hidden in this Flowing Sand Valley, the news is not blocked."</p><p></p><p>"However, even if you know this news, so what? Do you know the inside story?"</p><p></p><p>Yan Ri changed the subject and started talking about the details that were not known to others.</p><p></p><p>"Gai Nie was not captured by the Qin army, but was ambushed by the masters of the Yin-Yang family."</p><p></p><p>"Strange, isn't it? Why would the Yin-Yang family happen to ambush Gai Nie?"</p><p></p><p>"When Gai Nie defected, even the Shadow Guards didn't have time to react, but then Ying Zheng suddenly ordered the Yin-Yang family masters to go and ambush Gai Nie in Crescent Moon Valley."</p><p></p><p>"It's as if he already knew that your senior brother would definitely pass through there."</p><p></p><p>Weizhang fell into deep thought.</p><p></p><p>Such confidential intelligence was undisclosed content.</p><p></p><p>After this person said it, it was indeed full of strangeness.</p><p></p><p>Yan Ri knew that Weizhang had already taken the bait, so he continued, "Also, this time with the papermaking incident, a new papermaking technology suddenly appeared out of nowhere. Don't you find it strange?"</p><p></p><p>Weizhang remained silent.</p><p></p><p>He already understood Yan Ri's implication.</p><p></p><p>There must be a sage beside Qin King Ying Zheng, planning strategies for him.</p><p></p><p>Seeing that he already understood, Yan Ri no longer beat around the bush and revealed his purpose.</p><p></p><p>"This is my deal. You Flowing Sand find out who is behind Ying Zheng, and in return, Luo Wang can provide information about Shi Ya Prison to help you fulfill your wish."</p><p></p><p>PS: 10 updates every day.

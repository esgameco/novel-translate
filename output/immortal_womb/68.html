        <h1>Chapter 68</h1>
        <div class="content">
            <p>Here is the full translation from Chinese to English:</p><p></p><p>Now all the Mohists have entered the Mohist Mechanical City, it's the perfect opportunity to capture them all in one fell swoop! </p><p></p><p>This has been Ying Zheng's goal ever since he started planning the jailbreak of the Mohists.</p><p></p><p>If he doesn't act now, then when? </p><p></p><p>Ying Zheng decisively gave the order: "Immediately gather all the top experts and prepare to take action against the traitorous Mohists. This pack of ambitious wolves must be eliminated this time!"</p><p></p><p>Zhang Han hesitated for a moment and asked, "Your Majesty, how should we deal with the Yin-Yang Sect and the Luo Wang?"</p><p></p><p>Mentioning these two sinister organizations, Ying Zheng sneered: "Same as before, notify them to join the battle. I want to see if they will still obey orders this time."</p><p></p><p>Don't they always think they're so smart? </p><p></p><p>Don't they always think about using him, the emperor, to overthrow the Great Qin?</p><p></p><p>If that's the case, then let him make good use of them! </p><p></p><p>Let them work hard for him and strive to wipe out the remnants of the Mohists!</p><p></p><p>It's also a good opportunity to squeeze out the remaining value of these two organizations!</p><p></p><p>This way, when the Shadow Guards finally deal with them, it will save some effort.</p><p></p><p>Zhang Han understood Ying Zheng's intention. </p><p></p><p>This is to once again let the Luo Wang and Yin-Yang Sect fight each other like dogs, while their Shadow Guards reap the benefits as the fisherman.</p><p></p><p>This method worked very well last time.</p><p></p><p>Seeing the people of Luo Wang being trounced by the Mohists, the Shadow Guards were thrilled.</p><p></p><p>Working for His Majesty together, the Luo Wang always looked down on them, the Shadow Guards, with disdain.</p><p></p><p>They also often secretly made small moves to trip them up.</p><p></p><p>The Shadow Guards have long wanted to replace the Luo Wang.</p><p></p><p>This time, it's a great opportunity.</p><p></p><p>Zhang Han accepted the order and left.</p><p></p><p>While gathering the Shadow Guard experts, he also sent a few men to notify the Luo Wang and Yin-Yang Sect about attacking the Mohists.</p><p></p><p>Soon, the people of Luo Wang received the message from the Shadow Guards.</p><p></p><p>Zhao Gao picked up Ying Zheng's edict and frowned at it for a long time. </p><p></p><p>With the assassin matter, it's clear that His Majesty no longer trusts the Luo Wang, thinking they did it.</p><p></p><p>Otherwise, he would have sent the Luo Wang to find the assassin long ago.</p><p></p><p>Enduring without reacting is a sign of great disaster to come.</p><p></p><p>And the edict sent at this juncture is even more filled with the scent of a trap.</p><p></p><p>Yan Ri grew anxious and asked, "What should we do now? Do we obey His Majesty's order?"</p><p></p><p>With the First Emperor's edict issued, disobeying the order is tantamount to being a traitor that anyone can execute.</p><p></p><p>But if they follow the order in the edict, the Luo Wang will likely lose many men like last time. </p><p></p><p>Stuck between a rock and a hard place, that's the situation.</p><p></p><p>Zhao Gao saw through the conspiracy in it, his face darkening.</p><p></p><p>His fingers exerted a bit of force, tearing the carefully written edict inch by inch.</p><p></p><p>Zhao Gao suppressed the anger in his heart and said, "No matter what happens, on the surface we must..."</p><p></p><p>Here is the full English translation of the excerpt from the Chinese novel:</p><p></p><p>"It still needs to be done, so gather the experts of the Luo network."</p><p></p><p>His Majesty has not yet torn off his mask with them, so they cannot take the first step to expose their disloyal hearts. </p><p></p><p>Otherwise, wouldn't that be self-destruction?</p><p></p><p>The Luo network is not like the Mohists, who have the righteous anti-Qin banner and a constant stream of talented people joining.</p><p></p><p>In the past, they practiced the arts of demons and monsters, and walked the path of eagles, hounds and claws.</p><p></p><p>They have long provoked a bunch of enemies in the martial arts world, and have no good reputation among the people.</p><p></p><p>Once they tear their faces with the emperor, without the support of the empire behind them,</p><p></p><p>They will become the target of public criticism, the object of attack by everyone in the martial arts world.</p><p></p><p>Since that's the case, it's better to take a gamble.</p><p></p><p>Bet that Ying Zheng still needs the Luo network now and won't deal with them so quickly.</p><p></p><p>At least not now, when it is necessary to exterminate the Mohist rebels.</p><p></p><p>Therefore, in this action, they do not need to go all out.</p><p></p><p>Just "make no mistake" is enough.</p><p></p><p>Not seeking merit, but seeking no fault.</p><p></p><p>No mistakes, so that the emperor can't find an excuse to deal with them.</p><p></p><p>Preserve strength to the greatest extent possible, wait out this crisis, and then deal with it slowly.</p><p></p><p>Under Zhao Gao's instructions, Yanri went to gather manpower.</p><p></p><p>Soon, Jingni, Liu Jiannu and other Luo network experts received the information and began to gather.</p><p></p><p>The same scene also happened in the Yin-Yang family.</p><p></p><p>Unlike the Luo network, the Yin-Yang family did not see the conspiracy in this, but saw full opportunities.</p><p></p><p>They have successfully blamed the assassin incident on the Luo network, and Ying Zheng has no idea that it was the people sent by the Yin-Yang family.</p><p></p><p>Then this time the task of exterminating the Mohist family is a manifestation of Ying Zheng's trust in the Yin-Yang family.</p><p></p><p>It is an opportunity specially provided for them to make contributions.</p><p></p><p>As long as they exterminate the Mohist rebels, the Yin-Yang family will surely gain Ying Zheng's trust and reuse.</p><p></p><p>Dong Huangtaiyi gathered the experts of the Yin-Yang family and explained the importance of this task, asking them to perform well.</p><p></p><p>Yueshen, Xinghun, Dasiming, Shaosiming and others respectfully expressed that they would prepare well and strive to take the lead in the action to exterminate the Mohists.</p><p></p><p>Dong Huangtaiyi was very satisfied and let them go to prepare.</p><p></p><p>Yueshen, Xinghun, Dasiming, Shaosiming and others are the main force in exterminating the Mohists.</p><p></p><p>On the surface, they all seem very active and have already made preparations to exterminate the Mohists.</p><p></p><p>But in fact, there are still big differences between them.</p><p></p><p>Yueshen, Xinghun and others may just go through the motions according to orders, after all, they don't take the Mohists seriously.</p><p></p><p>Dasiming and Shaosiming are preparing to perform well in front of Ying Chen.</p><p></p><p>PS: Ask for flowers, rating tickets, comments, monthly tickets, rewards, thank you lords!</p><p></p><p>Three things about reading: read, collect, and reward!</p>

        <h1>Chapter 64</h1>
        <div class="content">
            <p>Aside from civil officials like Li Si, some military generals in Xianyang City were also eager to take action, fully prepared for anything.</p><p></p><p>They were just waiting for His Majesty's command to lead their troops to provide protection.</p><p></p><p>Matters in the imperial harem could be big or small, all depending on His Majesty's mood.</p><p></p><p>At the very least, the appearance of an assassin in the harem meant that the defense was lax and someone behind the scenes was disrespecting the royal family.</p><p></p><p>At worst, the real target of the assassin could have been His Majesty, meaning that someone was plotting a rebellion to overthrow the Great Qin.</p><p></p><p>In any case, for the generals, the sudden appearance of an assassin was a good opportunity to show their loyalty to His Majesty.</p><p></p><p>At the Wang Residence.</p><p></p><p>Wang Li received intelligence that the Shadow Guards and the city's forbidden troops had all been mobilized, guarding the entire Xianyang Palace so tightly that not even water could leak through.</p><p></p><p>It was clear that there had been new developments in the imperial harem.</p><p></p><p>Wang Li felt that his opportunity had come.</p><p></p><p>With burning eyes, he gave the order: "Notify the troops, let the battle-hardened armored soldiers prepare for combat and await His Majesty's decree."</p><p></p><p>Last time, when the Northern Barbarians were causing trouble, His Majesty had sent Meng Tian but not him.</p><p></p><p>This gave him a slight sense of crisis.</p><p></p><p>The Wang and Meng families were both military aristocratic clans of the empire, and Wang Li and Meng Tian were also the new generation of imperial generals.</p><p></p><p>But their situations were quite different.</p><p></p><p>Wang Li's father, Wang Ben, and grandfather, Wang Jian, were both famously great generals of the Qin state.</p><p></p><p>In the past, during the Qin state's wars to unify the world, apart from the Han state, the other five states were all conquered by Wang Jian and his son.</p><p></p><p>Meanwhile, Meng Tian's father, Meng Wu, was only Wang Jian's deputy general at the time.</p><p></p><p>But as the Meng family gradually gained favor from Ying Zheng over the generations, Meng Tian's official position was now higher than Wang Li's.</p><p></p><p>This made Wang Li increasingly anxious.</p><p></p><p>Especially since this time Meng Tian had led troops to fight the Northern Barbarians, if he established meritorious service, it would further widen the gap with the Wang family.</p><p></p><p>By then, their Wang family would completely fall behind the Meng family!</p><p></p><p>Thinking of this, Wang Li could not bear it.</p><p></p><p>The glory of the Wang family could not decline in his hands!</p><p></p><p>He had to seize the opportunity to establish meritorious service and regain His Majesty's favor!</p><p></p><p>To let the Wang family once again surpass the Meng family in status!</p><p></p><p>Wang Li secretly made up his mind.</p><p></p><p>Apart from this, the nobles and aristocrats in Xianyang City were all anxious and uneasy.</p><p></p><p>They feared being implicated, or that their backers in the imperial harem would encounter problems.</p><p></p><p>The relationships between the aristocratic families were all intertwined, with ties of kinship and marriage.</p><p></p><p>If one person got into trouble, it would implicate the entire family, leading to dozens or even hundreds of people losing their heads.</p><p></p><p>Moreover, in a place like the imperial harem, where concubines competed for favor, anything could happen.</p><p></p><p>That night, many people in Xianyang City found it hard to sleep.</p><p></p><p>Similarly, the Yin-Yang Masters were also having a hard time.</p><p></p><p>For this operation, even Dong Huangtaiyi was not fully confident.</p><p></p><p>He even somewhat regretted rashly making a move against the imperial harem.</p><p></p><p>He had already been lying low for so many years, how could he not hold back?</p><p></p><p>Ying Zheng these...</p><p></p><p>Here is the full translation of the Chinese excerpt into English:</p><p></p><p>The various strange actions of Shi Ri had not yet found an answer, and their actions were very likely to alert the enemy.</p><p></p><p>If they were discovered, not only would their years of planning be in vain, but it would also be difficult to explain to Ying Zheng.</p><p></p><p>In the past, when Ying Zheng dealt with the six nations, he was swift and fierce. Once he discovered that the Yin-Yang family he trusted had actually sent assassins to his harem, he would inevitably be furious.</p><p></p><p>Although the Yin-Yang family had many masters, Ying Zheng was the king of Qin, with tens of thousands and hundreds of thousands of troops in his hands.</p><p></p><p>Even if the Yin-Yang family had superb martial arts, they could not withstand the human sea tactics and overwhelming offensive.</p><p></p><p>Thinking of this, Dong Huang Taiyi became extremely anxious and couldn't help pacing back and forth in the palace.</p><p></p><p>At this moment, Da Siming and Shao Siming returned.</p><p></p><p>Seeing the injuries on the two, Dong Huang Taiyi's voice changed.</p><p></p><p>He asked anxiously, "What happened? How did you get injured?!"</p><p></p><p>Could it be that they were discovered by the Shadow Guards?</p><p></p><p>Could it be that his years of planning would be in vain like this?</p><p></p><p>Thinking of this possibility, Dong Huang Taiyi felt a chill all over his body.</p><p></p><p>Da Siming explained according to Ying Chen's instructions, "When we were investigating in the harem, we encountered a mysterious person's attack and failed to complete the mission. Please forgive us, Lord Dong Huang."</p><p></p><p>Dong Huang Taiyi's tone became even more anxious.</p><p></p><p>"Is this the point now? What I want to know is, has your identity been exposed?"</p><p></p><p>Compared to whether the mission was completed or not, he was more worried about this matter.</p><p></p><p>Da Siming shook his head, "Rest assured, Lord Dong Huang, our identities have not been exposed. We took many detours before returning."</p><p></p><p>"And when we left, we deliberately led the pursuing Shadow Guards to the Luo Wang people."</p><p></p><p>"The Shadow Guards will only think that the assassins were sent by Luo Wang and will not associate it with the Yin-Yang family."</p><p></p><p>Hearing their meticulous approach, Dong Huang Taiyi finally breathed a sigh of relief.</p><p></p><p>It's good that they weren't discovered.</p><p></p><p>Shifting the blame to Luo Wang was an excellent move!</p><p></p><p>With a scapegoat, Ying Zheng would be even less likely to suspect the Yin-Yang family!</p><p></p><p>When Ying Zheng and Luo Wang turn against each other, the Yin-Yang family can take this opportunity to gain Ying Zheng's trust!</p><p></p><p>Thinking of this, Dong Huang Taiyi's voice couldn't help but carry a hint of laughter.</p><p></p><p>"You did very well this time, adapting to the situation with quick wit. Alright, go down and treat your wounds."</p><p></p><p>Dong Huang Taiyi waved his hand, dismissing the two to go treat their injuries.</p><p></p><p>"So that's how it is. Although we couldn't find out the other party's identity this time, this at least shows that there are indeed people hiding in the harem..."</p><p></p><p>Dong Huang Taiyi muttered to himself, pondering.</p><p></p><p>Da Siming and Shao Siming didn't dare to disturb him and withdrew hand in hand.</p><p></p><p>PS: Asking for flowers, rating tickets, comments, monthly tickets, rewards, thank you to all the ancestors!</p><p></p><p>Three things about reading: read, collect, and reward!</p>

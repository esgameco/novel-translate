        <h1>Chapter 35</h1>
        <div class="content">
            <p>Here is the full translation of the Chinese excerpt into English:</p><p></p><p>Gai Nie and Mo Yu Qilin saw Wei Zhuang appear and couldn't help but feel anxious in their hearts.</p><p></p><p>"Xiao Zhuang! Quickly leave this place!"</p><p></p><p>"Lord Wei Zhuang, don't worry about me! Go quickly!"</p><p></p><p>The two of them, regardless of their own situation, desperately warned Wei Zhuang.</p><p></p><p>Unfortunately, it was already too late.</p><p></p><p>Wei Zhuang had already stepped into this place and had been noticed by Zhang Han and the others.</p><p></p><p>How could they possibly let him escape?</p><p></p><p>Sheng Qi, looking at the two struggling, couldn't help but say, "You two, don't waste your efforts. Once you enter here, even without these experts present, it's not easy to leave."</p><p></p><p>"Not to mention, in the current situation, they have obviously come prepared. How would they easily let anyone escape?"</p><p></p><p>At this time, Wei Zhuang's face had already turned extremely ugly.</p><p></p><p>He asked in a deep voice, "Is it ultimately my bad luck, or were you all waiting here for me from the beginning?"</p><p></p><p>He was still unwilling to believe that he had stepped into an ambush with one foot.</p><p></p><p>Zhang Han was calm and collected, saying, "What do you think?"</p><p></p><p>He had no obligation to answer the doubts of an anti-Qin person.</p><p></p><p>It was better to let him figure out this answer himself.</p><p></p><p>Without Zhang Han needing to say it, from the moment Wei Zhuang stepped into this place, he had already been reflecting on where exactly the problem was.</p><p></p><p>In an instant, all kinds of thoughts surged into Wei Zhuang's mind.</p><p></p><p>From Luo Wang first coming to his door, to the current situation of Mo Yu Qilin being trapped, and even the possibility of him perishing here miserably today, they all flashed through his mind one by one.</p><p></p><p>How exactly did it come to form the current situation?</p><p></p><p>Suddenly, a flash went through his mind, and he thought of the same thing as Mo Yu Qilin.</p><p></p><p>Could it be that from the beginning, Luo Wang seeking cooperation with Liu Sha was fake, and in reality, they wanted to capture them all in one net?</p><p></p><p>Was Luo Wang actually a chess piece used by Ying Zheng to deal with Liu Sha?</p><p></p><p>Thinking of this possibility, a layer of frost covered Wei Zhuang's face, and he said in a gloomy tone, "Did Luo Wang betray me? Betray Liu Sha?"</p><p></p><p>Hearing this answer, Zhang Han's expression changed.</p><p></p><p>A storm had already stirred up in his heart.</p><p></p><p>What did this mean?</p><p></p><p>Luo Wang betrayed?!</p><p></p><p>How did this matter involve Luo Wang?</p><p></p><p>This wasn't Liu Sha's independent action? How was Luo Wang also participating in this?!</p><p></p><p>Wasn't Luo Wang loyal to the court?</p><p></p><p>In private, they were actually also colluding with these anti-Qin forces?</p><p></p><p>When did this matter start? Did His Majesty know?</p><p></p><p>If His Majesty had been kept in the dark all along, wouldn't that be very dangerous?</p><p></p><p>Thinking of this possibility, Zhang Han couldn't help but clench his fists.</p><p></p><p>He must quickly report this news to His Majesty!</p><p></p><p>He couldn't let Luo Wang endanger His Majesty!</p><p></p><p>In a short instant, all kinds of thoughts flashed through Zhang Han's mind, but on the surface, Zhang Han didn't reveal anything.</p><p></p><p>Instead, he didn't make a sound</p><p></p><p>Here is the full English translation of the excerpt from the Chinese novel:</p><p></p><p>Color said: "As for your question, when you have the chance, you should go ask the people of Luo Wang yourself."</p><p></p><p>Of course, most likely he would not have this opportunity today. </p><p></p><p>And Wei Zhuang took Zhang Han's answer as a tacit confirmation of his question.</p><p></p><p>A surge of anger welled up in his chest. </p><p></p><p>Luo Wang actually dared to scheme against him like this!</p><p></p><p>If there was a chance to get out, Flowing Sand would definitely find Luo Wang to settle this score!</p><p></p><p>On the other side, Zhang Han gestured to the Yin-Yang family masters: "Everyone, even though it's only Wei Zhuang alone, don't let your guard down. Let's take action together."</p><p></p><p>Moon God nodded. The other members of the Yin-Yang family had received the order and were ready.</p><p></p><p>At this moment, Wei Zhuang was still unwilling to admit defeat. </p><p></p><p>He gripped his sword, revealing the shark-toothed blade, and said, "I was just wanting to experience the prowess of the Shadow Guard Commander and the Yin-Yang family."</p><p></p><p>Gai Nie was all too clear about Wei Zhuang's strength.</p><p></p><p>If it was a one-on-one duel, he would be evenly matched with him.</p><p></p><p>But now, Wei Zhuang was not facing a single opponent.</p><p></p><p>But several masters.</p><p></p><p>This was similar to the situation when he was ambushed by the Yin-Yang family in Crescent Moon Valley that day. </p><p></p><p>Those Yin-Yang family masters had once joined forces to take down Gai Nie.</p><p></p><p>Today, there was also Zhang Han in addition, plus the unfavorable environment of the Devouring Fang Prison.</p><p></p><p>It could be said that Wei Zhuang's chances of winning were slim to none.</p><p></p><p>Gai Nie sighed inwardly, knowing that Wei Zhuang would be hard-pressed to escape unscathed today.</p><p></p><p>The Yin-Yang family masters would not go easy on Wei Zhuang. They directly launched a joint attack on him.</p><p></p><p>Wei Zhuang took out his shark-toothed sword and struggled to fight back.</p><p></p><p>Zhang Han also joined the battle.</p><p></p><p>For a time, the sound of fighting rang out in this space.</p><p></p><p>Sure enough, it was just as Gai Nie predicted. </p><p></p><p>In less than half an hour, under the dense offensive, Wei Zhuang was already showing a tendency to be defeated.</p><p></p><p>In the end, just like Gai Nie, Wei Zhuang was defeated.</p><p></p><p>He was captured by Zhang Han's Shadow Guards and imprisoned in another cell.</p><p></p><p>Zhang Han thought of the other people from Flowing Sand.</p><p></p><p>Since Wei Zhuang had come, it was impossible that the others from Flowing Sand had not come.</p><p></p><p>Most likely they were waiting outside, ready to assist Wei Zhuang's escape.</p><p></p><p>So Zhang Han said to Moon God, "Please come with me to scout outside the Devouring Fang Prison. It's very likely that Wei Zhuang's accomplices are there."</p><p></p><p>Moon God and the others had no objections and nodded in agreement. </p><p></p><p>In any case, catching one Wei Zhuang was catching him.</p><p></p><p>Capturing the other people from Flowing Sand was also catching them. </p><p></p><p>It would be better to do a thorough job and make the Emperor trust and rely on them even more.</p><p></p><p>This way their plan would proceed more smoothly.</p><p></p><p>Then, the Yin-Yang family masters went out of the Devouring Fang Prison together with Zhang Han.</p><p></p><p>PS: Asking for flowers, rating tickets, comments, monthly tickets, rewards, thanks to all the handsome readers!</p><p></p><p>Feilu Novels, Fei wants you to have a good read!</p>

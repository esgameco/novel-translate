            <p>Yingchen didn't want to take action in front of his mother.</p><p></p><p>Shu Fei was just an ordinary person. If any unusual events occurred, it would scare her to death.</p><p></p><p>Moreover, there must be some forces supporting Moyu Qilin's visit this time.</p><p></p><p>If she died, someone would definitely notice the oddity.</p><p></p><p>Maybe they would even associate it with Shu Fei.</p><p></p><p>At that time, his existence might be exposed.</p><p></p><p>Even before he was born, he had such abilities. Not to mention whether it would cause panic in others.</p><p></p><p>Safety alone was a big problem.</p><p></p><p>Those malicious people would definitely try every means to deal with him.</p><p></p><p>Luo Wang, Yin-Yang family, Liu Sha...</p><p></p><p>By then, what Shu Fei would face would be endless enemies.</p><p></p><p>Even if he was confident that he could protect Shu Fei, there were only thieves for a thousand days, but no one could guard against thieves for a thousand days.</p><p></p><p>He still needed to cultivate and couldn't watch over Shu Fei's safety every day.</p><p></p><p>In short, exposure now would not benefit him at all.</p><p></p><p>Since that was the case, as long as Moyu Qilin didn't take action for the time being, he would wait and see.</p><p></p><p>See if there were other solutions.</p><p></p><p>Next, Yingchen stared at Moyu Qilin's every move.</p><p></p><p>Then Yingchen discovered that she didn't seem to be here to hurt anyone, but more like she was here to investigate something.</p><p></p><p>After Moyu Qilin finished lighting the incense and withdrew, she searched all over Shu Fei's palace.</p><p></p><p>While pretending to be a palace maid busy with chores and chatting with others,</p><p></p><p>She took the opportunity of doing chores to patrol everywhere and look for places where people might be hiding.</p><p></p><p>If there was someone behind the scenes giving Shu Fei advice, this person most likely lived here.</p><p></p><p>And as long as there was a place where people lived, there must be traces.</p><p></p><p>With her abilities, it was impossible not to find out.</p><p></p><p>Moyu Qilin believed so.</p><p></p><p>So she searched very seriously, not even missing a single floor tile in Shu Fei's palace.</p><p></p><p>But after such a carpet search, she still didn't get any clues.</p><p></p><p>Moyu Qilin couldn't believe it.</p><p></p><p>Because she found that Shu Fei's palace was really too normal.</p><p></p><p>From her perspective, there was nothing suspicious of any mechanism inside the palace.</p><p></p><p>As for the palace maids and eunuchs, they were even more ordinary than ordinary.</p><p></p><p>Not a single one of them had practiced martial arts, and even those who could be said to be strong and powerful were barely so.</p><p></p><p>In her conversations with them, she also didn't find any special person at all.</p><p></p><p>At least there was no one who was especially favored by Shu Fei or treated specially.</p><p></p><p>And there was also no one capable enough to play the role of a strategist.</p><p></p><p>Moyu Qilin was confused.</p><p></p><p>This was completely different from the intelligence!</p><p></p><p>Didn't the intelligence say that the person behind Shu Fei had very high cultivation, even the number one assassin under the</p><p></p><p>Here is the full English translation of the Chinese novel excerpt:</p><p></p><p>She was so startled that she didn't even conceal her own breath, nearly exposing herself. </p><p></p><p>Moreover, she strategized for Ying Zheng, a very resourceful person.</p><p></p><p>In the entire Shu Fei Palace, there was simply no one who satisfied these two requirements!</p><p></p><p>There were no signs of anyone hiding, and there was no such person by Shu Fei's side. </p><p></p><p>So where exactly was this person?</p><p></p><p>She didn't understand, how could there not be a single clue to be found?</p><p></p><p>In all her years of carrying out missions, she had never encountered this kind of situation before.</p><p></p><p>The Shu Fei Palace, which seemed completely unguarded and had its doors wide open, actually didn't have a single weakness?!</p><p></p><p>Could it be that the person strategizing for Shu Fei was not in the Shu Fei Palace?</p><p></p><p>But resided somewhere else in the palace?</p><p></p><p>Perhaps he was in contact with Shu Fei through other means? </p><p></p><p>If that was really the case, then things would be a bit troublesome.</p><p></p><p>Mo Yu Qilin felt her head aching faintly.</p><p></p><p>The rear palace was very large, and there were many people in charge of each place.</p><p></p><p>If that possibly existing person was not in the Shu Fei Palace, then it would take a lot of time to find them.</p><p></p><p>She would need to investigate the palaces one by one, as well as the people in charge inside them.</p><p></p><p>This task was no less than having to turn the entire imperial palace inside out.</p><p></p><p>Just thinking about this workload made one's scalp go numb.</p><p></p><p>She didn't know how long it would take for her alone to get this task done.</p><p></p><p>Forget it, in any case this mission didn't have a set time limit.</p><p></p><p>She might as well calm down and do it bit by bit.</p><p></p><p>Mo Yu Qilin planned to wait until nighttime and investigate the surrounding palaces with the Shu Fei Palace at the center.</p><p></p><p>Gradually expanding the scope of her search.</p><p></p><p>As long as this person was in the palace, sooner or later there would be a day she would catch them.</p><p></p><p>Thinking this way, Mo Yu Qilin was not in such a hurry anymore.</p><p></p><p>After all, she was facing a mountain of work, and being anxious was of no use.</p><p></p><p>Ying Chen discovered that Mo Yu Qilin seemed to have temporarily settled down, and truly seemed to regard herself as a palace maid, beginning to work diligently.</p><p></p><p>There were no signs of rash movements.</p><p></p><p>It seemed that this Mo Yu Qilin was also a rather patient person.</p><p></p><p>Ying Chen was the same as Mo Yu Qilin, he was also waiting for nightfall.</p><p></p><p>Ying Chen believed that since Mo Yu Qilin had not left, it meant her goal had not yet been achieved.</p><p></p><p>He estimated that in the daytime when there were many people and prying eyes, it was inconvenient for her to take action.</p><p></p><p>So there was a high likelihood she was waiting for nightfall, waiting for when there were fewer people to continue taking action.</p><p></p><p>If that was the case, then it suited his intentions perfectly.</p><p></p><p>He also had to wait for nightfall when there were fewer people to take care of her.</p><p></p><p>PS: Asking for flowers, rating tickets, comments, monthly tickets, rewards, thank you to the readers!</p><p></p><p>Feilu Novels, Fei wants you to have a good read!</p>

        <div class="content">
            <p>In the Xianyang Palace.</p><p></p><p>Zhang Han was reporting the progress of the event to Ying Zheng.</p><p></p><p>"Your Majesty, currently Gai Nie, Wei Zhuang, and Mo Yu Qilin have been rescued, but all three of them have been poisoned with a slow-acting toxin. If they recklessly use their internal energy, they will definitely suffer heavy injuries and become a burden to their escape."</p><p></p><p>All of this was planned in advance by them.</p><p></p><p>The Shadow Guards have also secretly followed the other party according to the previous arrangement.</p><p></p><p>By then, they will be able to follow this group of people to find their den.</p><p></p><p>After hearing Zhang Han's report, Ying Zheng was all smiles, very satisfied.</p><p></p><p>For many years, these rebels led by the Mohists have been secretly active, looking for an opportunity to rebel against Qin.</p><p></p><p>Like rats in the sewers, they can't be eliminated, can't be defeated, and are even growing in number.</p><p></p><p>This time is different.</p><p></p><p>This time their plan is perfect.</p><p></p><p>They will definitely be able to catch all these rats hiding in the dark in one fell swoop.</p><p></p><p>Let them never dare to appear and confront the Great Qin again!</p><p></p><p>And that Luo Wang, the ungrateful traitor, this time he fought with the Mohist rebels like dogs.</p><p></p><p>Not only did he not gain any benefits, but he also suffered heavy losses.</p><p></p><p>Ying Zheng felt delighted thinking about this.</p><p></p><p>His son is really amazing.</p><p></p><p>With the smallest cost, he obtained the result he was most happy to see.</p><p></p><p>Ying Zheng couldn't help but feel that it was a pity that this son was born in the wrong era.</p><p></p><p>If this son had come a dozen years earlier, with his intelligence and wisdom, he might have been able to manipulate the Six Kingdoms at will!</p><p></p><p>In that case, there would be no need to spend so many years at war, and the unification could be completed directly!</p><p></p><p>Thinking of the scene of the Six Kingdoms submitting at his feet, Ying Zheng was excited.</p><p></p><p>But after careful consideration, a dozen years ago, he and Concubine Shu had not met yet.</p><p></p><p>Wanting this son was asking too much.</p><p></p><p>Ying Zheng couldn't help but laugh at his own greedy thoughts.</p><p></p><p>At this time, the eunuch reported: "Your Majesty, Zhao Gao, the Prefect of the Central Chariots, requests an audience."</p><p></p><p>Ying Zheng glanced at Zhang Han, who took the hint and hid himself.</p><p></p><p>After making sure Zhang Han was out of sight, Ying Zheng said, "Let him in."</p><p></p><p>The eunuch let Zhao Gao in.</p><p></p><p>Zhao Gao's face was pale. As soon as he entered, he knelt on the ground and said with trepidation, "Your Majesty! This minister is guilty! I beg Your Majesty to punish me!"</p><p></p><p>Ying Zheng had already learned this news from Zhang Han.</p><p></p><p>However, compared to his smiling appearance just now, this time Ying Zheng's eyes were wide open, and his body leaned forward suddenly. He seemed to be in disbelief of the news he heard.</p><p></p><p>Here is the full translation of the Chinese excerpt into English:</p><p></p><p>He slammed his palm on the armrest of the chair and angrily said, "What are you doing?! Demon Fang Prison is known as the devouring fangs of life, how could a prisoner escape?"</p><p></p><p>Ying Zheng inwardly admired his own acting skills, instantly showing the appropriate shock and anger.</p><p></p><p>Zhao Gao, kneeling on the ground, felt a chill in his heart upon hearing these words. </p><p></p><p>He had deliberately arrived a little late, watching the Shadow Guards enter the palace first.</p><p></p><p>He was certain that for such a big matter, the Shadow Guards would definitely not conceal it.</p><p></p><p>They would surely report to the Emperor first, but Ying Zheng was still displaying a shocked appearance as if hearing it for the first time.</p><p></p><p>Wasn't this clearly acting for his sake? </p><p></p><p>Didn't this indicate that Yanri's concerns were very likely true?</p><p></p><p>Was all of this deliberately arranged by His Majesty?!</p><p></p><p>But why on earth would he do this?!</p><p></p><p>Zhao Gao couldn't figure out the reason, feeling both alarmed and fearful.</p><p></p><p>But he didn't dare show it on his face, and could only display a look of shame.</p><p></p><p>"This subject has failed Your Majesty's trust! Unworthy of Your Majesty's cultivation, this subject's death would not atone for the crime! I can only apologize with my life! I only beg Your Majesty not to be angry, so as not to harm the Dragon's body!"</p><p></p><p>When it came to acting skills, Zhao Gao was also not to be outdone.</p><p></p><p>Since Zhao Gao himself said he wanted to apologize, Ying Zheng naturally couldn't give up this good opportunity. </p><p></p><p>Ying Zheng snorted coldly: "Since that's the case, you can reflect on your mistakes behind closed doors for now, and temporarily put aside Hu Hai's guidance."</p><p></p><p>This punishment appeared extremely lenient on the surface, without any substantive punishment.</p><p></p><p>But the severity within was only known to the parties involved.</p><p></p><p>Zhao Gao hurriedly kowtowed to express thanks, grateful for His Majesty's grace.</p><p></p><p>Ying Zheng got tired after acting for a while, he waved his hand and directly ordered Zhao Gao to withdraw.</p><p></p><p>Zhao Gao respectfully left the palace.</p><p></p><p>The moment he exited the palace, Zhao Gao's face instantly turned gloomy. </p><p></p><p>Reflecting behind closed doors, not even having to teach Hu Hai, was this to strip him away along with the net?</p><p></p><p>It seemed His Majesty had long harbored the idea of weakening him.</p><p></p><p>Zhao Gao couldn't understand it.</p><p></p><p>Even though he always had other plans in his heart, he felt he had performed very well over the years.</p><p></p><p>He never revealed any flaws, and he didn't intend to do anything major while Ying Zheng was still alive. </p><p></p><p>At most, he was just preparing for a rainy day.</p><p></p><p>Why did Ying Zheng suddenly start suspecting him?</p><p></p><p>He had even begun to weaken him.</p><p></p><p>Where exactly did the problem arise? </p><p></p><p>Zhao Gao pondered but couldn't figure it out.</p><p></p><p>But one thing he could be sure of was that he needed to make preparations in advance. If push came to shove, he could only resort to desperate measures.</p><p></p><p>PS: Asking for flowers, rating tickets, comments, monthly tickets, rewards, thank you to the readers!</p><p></p><p>Feilu Novels, Fei wants you to have a good read!</p>

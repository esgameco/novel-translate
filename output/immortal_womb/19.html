        <h1>Chapter 19</h1>
        <div class="content">
            <p>Originally, Ying Zheng had already harbored an overwhelming murderous intent towards the Yin-Yang family.</p><p></p><p>A bunch of ungrateful things, not worthy of living!</p><p></p><p>He even wanted to give the order now to arrest all the people of the Yin-Yang family.</p><p></p><p>But after hearing Ying Chen's inner thoughts, he calmed down instead.</p><p></p><p>Now the enemy was in the dark, and he was in the light.</p><p></p><p>He still didn't know if Yun Zhong Jun disguising the poison as an elixir and giving it to him was Yun Zhong Jun's plan alone?</p><p></p><p>Or was it the plan of the entire Yin-Yang family?</p><p></p><p>If it was Yun Zhong Jun's plan alone, then killing him would suffice.</p><p></p><p>If the people within the Yin-Yang family were also involved, or even if this matter was carried out under the manipulation of the Yin-Yang family.</p><p></p><p>Then things would be complicated.</p><p></p><p>The Yin-Yang family were not ordinary people, each possessing strange martial arts skills.</p><p></p><p>If he were to take action against them, he must succeed in one strike, capture them all in one net, and eliminate them root and branch.</p><p></p><p>Otherwise, if one was left out, it would be an endless source of future trouble.</p><p></p><p>Especially since Yun Zhong Jun could also use the Ghost Control Pill to manipulate the living.</p><p></p><p>If Yun Zhong Jun was given the opportunity to control him or others, it would bring a devastating blow to the empire.</p><p></p><p>Moreover, he hadn't forgotten about the Luo Wang matter.</p><p></p><p>Luo Wang was also lurking in the shadows with ill intentions.</p><p></p><p>If he revealed his murderous intent too early, allowing Luo Wang and the Yin-Yang family to secretly join forces, it would be troublesome.</p><p></p><p>Things had to be done one at a time, meals had to be eaten one bite at a time.</p><p></p><p>He would deal with them one by one, which was safer.</p><p></p><p>At the very least, he now knew their true colors.</p><p></p><p>And those people of theirs still didn't know his thoughts.</p><p></p><p>The situation was still in his favor.</p><p></p><p>Especially since this brat said he was interested in the people of the Yin-Yang family.</p><p></p><p>This was the first time in such a long time that he had heard of him wanting something.</p><p></p><p>It seemed that this brat was already interested in beauties.</p><p></p><p>Beauties, as long as they didn't hinder the overall situation, he didn't mind giving them to this brat as a favor.</p><p></p><p>After all, this kid had already helped him a lot.</p><p></p><p>It was only right to give a little something in return.</p><p></p><p>He was not an inflexible person either.</p><p></p><p>Since this brat was interested in the Yin-Yang family, then for the sake of this kid's face, he would not move against the Yin-Yang family for now.</p><p></p><p>Let them live a little longer.</p><p></p><p>In just a short moment, many thoughts had already flashed through Ying Zheng's mind.</p><p></p><p>The murderous intent that originally couldn't be hidden gradually subsided, until finally, it completely disappeared.</p><p></p><p>The eunuchs and palace maids in attendance secretly breathed a sigh of relief.</p><p></p><p>Just now, the aura from His Majesty was too frightening, as if blood would be shed on the spot.</p><p></p><p>It scared them into thinking that their lives were no longer safe.</p><p></p><p>Only after Zhang Han noticed that the emperor's aura had stabilized did his face become solemn.</p><p></p><p>Here is the full translation of the Chinese excerpt into English:</p><p></p><p>He opened his mouth.</p><p></p><p>"Your Majesty, do we need to arrest Yun Zhong Jun and interrogate him?"</p><p></p><p>Zhang Han was truly loyal to the First Emperor. He would never allow anyone in the court to secretly harm the Emperor.</p><p></p><p>Ying Zheng knew his loyalty, but he had already made other plans during his contemplation just now.</p><p></p><p>So Ying Zheng shook his head and said, "No need. Please keep this matter confidential. If any of you leak this information, I will have your life!"</p><p></p><p>Upon hearing this, the eunuchs and palace maids present all knelt down, their bodies shaking like autumn leaves, fearfully saying they wouldn't dare.</p><p></p><p>Concubine Shu looked at the Emperor with a worried face.</p><p></p><p>"Your Majesty, what about your headache? Without the medicine, your headache will continue to act up."</p><p></p><p>The Emperor's migraine had been around for a long time, and the royal doctors were unable to treat it.</p><p></p><p>Others might not know, but Concubine Shu knew.</p><p></p><p>Every time the Emperor's headache acted up, it was extremely painful.</p><p></p><p>The pain couldn't be relieved whether he was walking or sitting.</p><p></p><p>At those times, let alone handling government affairs, even if he simply did nothing, it was still terribly painful.</p><p></p><p>Ying Chen heard these words and remembered Ying Zheng's headache. He subconsciously thought of his own ability.</p><p></p><p>[It's just a migraine. If he learns my Huangji Dadao Jing, he doesn't need to go too deep. As long as he enters the Huangqi realm, it can be easily solved.]</p><p></p><p>Ying Zheng was overjoyed when he heard this.</p><p></p><p>His son is indeed reliable!</p><p></p><p>Without any elixir, his headache can be resolved.</p><p></p><p>Having such a son, the ancestors of Qin must be blessing him!</p><p></p><p>So they sent such a son, not only to help him see through the true faces of the surrounding jackals and tigers,</p><p></p><p>But also to solve his own stubborn illness!</p><p></p><p>And later even fulfill his wish for longevity!</p><p></p><p>This is his great fortune!</p><p></p><p>It is also the luck of the Qin state!</p><p></p><p>Ying Zheng had a bottom in his heart. His brows relaxed, and his whole person became much more open-minded. Instead, he comforted Concubine Shu.</p><p></p><p>"Don't worry, it's just a headache. I've persisted for so many years, it's not a big deal."</p><p></p><p>Concubine Shu was still very worried.</p><p></p><p>She heartily felt distressed for the Emperor.</p><p></p><p>So, she reached out her hand and said, "Your Majesty, let me massage your head to relieve the pain."</p><p></p><p>Ying Zheng nodded, enjoying Concubine Shu's massage while pondering the inner voice he had just heard.</p><p></p><p>Huangji Dadao Jing?</p><p></p><p>Could this be the method for longevity that kid mentioned?</p><p></p><p>After cultivating it, it could cure his headache and let him live long?</p><p></p><p>Such a good technique, when can he actually start cultivating it?</p><p></p><p>Ying Zheng suddenly became expectant.</p><p></p><p>PS: Asking for flowers, rating tickets, comments, monthly tickets, rewards, thanks to all the ancestors!</p><p></p><p>Feilu Novels, Fei wants you to have a good read!</p>

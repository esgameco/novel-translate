        <h1>Chapter 42</h1>
        <div class="content">
            <p>Here is the full English translation of the excerpt from the Chinese novel:</p><p></p><p>On the other side, Zhang Liang was leading the Flowing Sand people to find the helpers he spoke of.</p><p></p><p>Under Zhang Liang's lead, the group arrived near the Mohist Mechanism City. </p><p></p><p>Just like last time, Mohist disciples appeared shortly after they lingered in the vicinity.</p><p></p><p>The Mohist disciples looked at these new faces that had appeared, their expressions unchanged.</p><p></p><p>Neither servile nor overbearing, they said: "If you all wish to enter the Mohist Mechanism City, you must cover your eyes and allow us to lead you in."</p><p></p><p>Seeing that it was the Mohist disciples who appeared, Chi Lian's face changed and she asked Zhang Liang: "The helpers you spoke of are the Mohists?"</p><p></p><p>There was a grudge between Flowing Sand and the Mohists, and it was not a light one.</p><p></p><p>It's said that the previous Mohist leader, the Six-Fingered Dark Hero, died from triggering a hidden ailment in his body after a fierce battle with Wei Zhuang.</p><p></p><p>Bai Feng and the others also had unpleasant expressions.</p><p></p><p>The grudge between the Mohists and Flowing Sand was one aspect.</p><p></p><p>The conditions for entering the Mechanism City were also very unfriendly to them.</p><p></p><p>If their eyes were covered, even for them, their combat strength would be greatly reduced.</p><p></p><p>If the Mohists wanted revenge at that time and secretly made a move, they would be in trouble.</p><p></p><p>It was not impossible that they would all perish here.</p><p></p><p>Zhang Liang knew that the Flowing Sand people had misgivings.</p><p></p><p>He sighed and said to them: "Everyone, the Mohist leader has already agreed to cooperate. Now it depends on Flowing Sand's choice."</p><p></p><p>"Wei Zhuang's life is in your hands."</p><p></p><p>Even the Mohists, who had a grudge with Flowing Sand, had already agreed to cooperate. What else could Flowing Sand nitpick about?</p><p></p><p>If they refused now, not only would the Mohists not help them, Zhang Liang likely would not pay them any more heed either.</p><p></p><p>Relying on themselves alone, without sufficient planning, there was no way they could rescue Wei Zhuang and the others.</p><p></p><p>Chi Lian was silent for a long time before finally agreeing to have her eyes covered.</p><p></p><p>The Wolf King and Yin Fu were still a bit unwilling, but seeing that Chi Lian, Bai Feng, and Wu Shuang Gui had already covered their eyes, they could only choose to agree.</p><p></p><p>The group followed the Mohist disciples into the Mohist Mechanism City.</p><p></p><p>Finally, after entering the city, the obstructions before their eyes were removed.</p><p></p><p>Just like that, they saw the Mohist leader wearing a bamboo hat and the various Mohist chiefs.</p><p></p><p>The Mohist chiefs looked at the Flowing Sand people with furrowed brows and cold faces, their attitudes unfriendly.</p><p></p><p>"Hmph, the Flowing Sand people still swagger in."</p><p></p><p>"Why didn't Wei Zhuang come, is he afraid?"</p><p></p><p>Hearing these words, the Flowing Sand people were instantly enraged and about to draw their weapons.</p><p></p><p>The Mohist leader heavily slapped the table and shouted: "Enough, say less you lot! We are here to cooperate, don't act like enemies!"</p><p></p><p>Hearing the anger in the leader's voice, the Mohist people all shut their mouths.</p><p></p><p>Only then did the Flowing Sand people's expressions improve.</p><p></p><p>Now, seeing this leader, they...</p><p></p><p>Here is the full English translation of the Chinese excerpt:</p><p></p><p>They truly believed that the Mo family was willing to cooperate with them.</p><p></p><p>Zhang Liang informed the Mo family that Wei Zhuang had already entered the Shi Ya Prison and was very likely captured. </p><p></p><p>Upon hearing this, the Mo family was shocked.</p><p></p><p>Wei Zhuang's strength goes without saying, he is one of the rarest people in the world.</p><p></p><p>Even so, he shouldn't have been so reckless to enter Shi Ya Prison alone!</p><p></p><p>In response, Liu Sha explained that in order to rescue Mo Yu Qilin, they asked Luo Wang for intelligence on Shi Ya Prison.</p><p></p><p>Only then did the Mo family understand that it was because of this intelligence that Wei Zhuang took such a big risk.</p><p></p><p>Chi Lian handed the intelligence to Zhang Liang and said, "Although Lord Wei Zhuang entered Shi Ya Prison according to the intelligence, he did not come out again, and even attracted Zhang Han's Shadow Guards and Yin-Yang family experts."</p><p></p><p>"We suspect that this intelligence was a trap set by Luo Wang."</p><p></p><p>Zhang Liang examined the intelligence and said, "The intelligence they provided about Shi Ya Prison should not be false, it's just that the other party had set up an ambush in advance."</p><p></p><p>Hearing this, Liu Sha's people were filled with resentment.</p><p></p><p>"Luo Wang is despicable and shameless! How dare they use such treacherous schemes to harm us!"</p><p></p><p>Originally, they thought that Luo Wang had given false intelligence, causing Wei Zhuang to be misled.</p><p></p><p>Now it seems that Luo Wang was more meticulous than they had imagined.</p><p></p><p>The intelligence was real, and the ambush was real too!</p><p></p><p>Thinking of Wei Zhuang facing the siege of various experts, Chi Lian was furious.</p><p></p><p>If they hadn't listened to Wei Zhuang at that time and went with him together, then they all would have encountered the siege!</p><p></p><p>Luo Wang just wanted to take down Liu Sha in one fell swoop!</p><p></p><p>The Mo family also clicked their tongues at Luo Wang's methods.</p><p></p><p>The intelligence provided about Shi Ya Prison was real, making it impossible to find any flaws, and one could only believe in Luo Wang's sincerity. </p><p></p><p>In this way, Liu Sha would really go to Shi Ya Prison according to that intelligence.</p><p></p><p>Luo Wang only needed to tell this intelligence to the Shadow Guards and Yin-Yang family.</p><p></p><p>Without them making a move, Liu Sha would be taken care of by these two forces!</p><p></p><p>What a brilliant move of borrowing a knife to kill someone!</p><p></p><p>If this tactic was used against them, they might not have been able to avoid falling for it either!</p><p></p><p>Thinking of this, the Mo family couldn't help but feel a lingering fear.</p><p></p><p>Zhang Liang looked at this intelligence and pondered, "Zhang Han and those Yin-Yang family experts are probably just wary of Wei Zhuang's strength, so they ambushed there."</p><p></p><p>"They can't be stationed at Shi Ya Prison for a long time. As long as we choose the right person to go, there is still hope to save people."</p><p></p><p>The crowd asked Zhang Liang, "Since that's the case, who exactly is the right person to choose?"</p><p></p><p>PS: Please give flowers, rating tickets, comments, monthly tickets, rewards, thanks to all the handsome readers!</p><p></p><p>Three things about reading: read, collect, and reward!</p>
